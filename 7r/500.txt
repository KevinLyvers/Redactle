jurisprudence, is, the, philosophy, and, theory, of, law, it, is, concerned, primarily, with, both, what, law, is, and, what, it, ought, to, be, that, includes, questions, of, how, persons, and, social, relations, are, understood, in, legal, terms, and, of, the, values, in, and, of, law, work, that, is, counted, as, jurisprudence, is, mostly, philosophical, but, it, includes, work, that, also, belongs, to, other, disciplines, such, as, sociology, history, politics, and, economics, modern, jurisprudence, began, in, the, 18th, century, and, was, based, on, the, first, principles, of, natural, law, civil, law, and, the, law, of, nations, general, jurisprudence, can, be, divided, into, categories, both, by, the, type, of, question, scholars, seek, to, answer, and, by, the, theories, of, jurisprudence, or, schools, of, thought, regarding, how, those, questions, are, best, answered, contemporary, philosophy, of, law, which, deals, with, general, jurisprudence, addresses, problems, internal, to, law, and, legal, systems, and, problems, of, law, as, a, social, institution, that, relates, to, the, larger, political, and, social, context, in, which, it, exists, ancient, natural, law, is, the, idea, that, there, are, rational, objective, limits, to, the, power, of, legislative, rulers, the, foundations, of, law, are, accessible, through, reason, and, it, is, from, these, laws, of, nature, that, human, laws, gain, whatever, force, they, have, analytic, jurisprudence, rejects, natural, law, s, fusing, of, what, law, is, and, what, it, ought, to, be, it, espouses, the, use, of, a, neutral, point, of, view, and, descriptive, language, when, referring, to, aspects, of, legal, systems, it, encompasses, such, theories, of, jurisprudence, as, legal, positivism, which, holds, that, there, is, no, necessary, connection, between, law, and, morality, and, that, the, force, of, law, comes, from, basic, social, facts, and, legal, realism, which, argues, that, the, real, world, practice, of, law, determines, what, law, is, the, law, having, the, force, that, it, does, because, of, what, legislators, lawyers, and, judges, do, with, it, unlike, experimental, jurisprudence, which, seeks, to, investigate, the, content, of, folk, legal, concepts, using, the, methods, of, social, science, the, traditional, method, of, both, natural, law, and, analytic, jurisprudence, is, philosophical, analysis, normative, jurisprudence, is, concerned, with, evaluative, theories, of, law, it, deals, with, what, the, goal, or, purpose, of, law, is, or, what, moral, or, political, theories, provide, a, foundation, for, the, law, it, not, only, addresses, the, question, what, is, law, but, also, tries, to, determine, what, the, proper, function, of, law, should, be, or, what, sorts, of, acts, should, be, subject, to, legal, sanctions, and, what, sorts, of, punishment, should, be, permitted, the, english, word, is, derived, from, the, latin, iurisprudentia, iuris, is, the, genitive, form, of, ius, meaning, law, and, prudentia, meaning, prudence, also, discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection, it, refers, to, the, exercise, of, good, judgment, common, sense, and, caution, especially, in, the, conduct, of, practical, matters, the, word, first, appeared, in, written, english, in, 1628, at, a, time, when, the, word, prudence, meant, knowledge, of, or, skill, in, a, matter, it, may, have, entered, english, via, the, french, jurisprudence, which, appeared, earlier, ancient, jurisprudence, begins, with, various, dharma, stra, texts, of, india, dharmasutras, of, pasta, ba, and, baudh, yana, are, examples, in, ancient, china, the, daoists, confucians, and, legalists, all, had, competing, theories, of, jurisprudence, jurisprudence, in, ancient, rome, had, its, origins, with, the, periti, experts, in, the, jus, mos, maiorum, traditional, law, a, body, of, oral, laws, and, customs, praetors, established, a, working, body, of, laws, by, judging, whether, or, not, singular, cases, were, capable, of, being, prosecuted, either, by, the, edicta, the, annual, pronunciation, of, prosecutable, offences, or, in, extraordinary, situations, additions, made, to, the, edicta, a, iudex, originally, a, magistrate, later, a, private, individual, appointed, to, judge, a, specific, case, would, then, prescribe, a, remedy, according, to, the, facts, of, the, case, the, sentences, of, the, iudex, were, supposed, to, be, simple, interpretations, of, the, traditional, customs, but, apart, from, considering, what, traditional, customs, applied, in, each, case, soon, developed, a, more, equitable, interpretation, coherently, adapting, the, law, to, newer, social, exigencies, the, law, was, then, adjusted, with, evolving, institutiones, legal, concepts, while, remaining, in, the, traditional, mode, praetors, were, replaced, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, by, a, laical, body, of, prudentes, admission, to, this, body, was, conditional, upon, proof, of, competence, or, experience, under, the, roman, empire, schools, of, law, were, created, and, practice, of, the, law, became, more, academic, from, the, early, roman, empire, to, the, 3rd, century, a, relevant, body, of, literature, was, produced, by, groups, of, scholars, including, the, proculians, and, sabinians, the, scientific, nature, of, the, studies, was, unprecedented, in, ancient, times, after, the, 3rd, century, juris, prudentia, became, a, more, bureaucratic, activity, with, few, notable, authors, it, was, during, the, eastern, roman, empire, 5th, century, that, legal, studies, were, once, again, undertaken, in, depth, and, it, is, from, this, cultural, movement, that, justinian, s, corpus, juris, civilis, was, born, in, its, general, sense, natural, law, theory, may, be, compared, to, both, state, of, nature, law, and, general, law, understood, on, the, basis, of, being, analogous, to, the, laws, of, physical, science, natural, law, is, often, contrasted, to, positive, law, which, asserts, law, as, the, product, of, human, activity, and, human, volition, another, approach, to, natural, law, jurisprudence, generally, asserts, that, human, law, must, be, in, response, to, compelling, reasons, for, action, there, are, two, readings, of, the, natural, law, jurisprudential, stance, notions, of, an, objective, moral, order, external, to, human, legal, systems, underlie, natural, law, what, is, right, or, wrong, can, vary, according, to, the, interests, one, is, focused, on, john, finnis, one, of, the, most, important, of, modern, natural, lawyers, has, argued, that, the, maxim, an, unjust, law, is, no, law, at, all, is, a, poor, guide, to, the, classical, thomist, position, aristotle, is, often, said, to, be, the, father, of, natural, law, like, his, philosophical, forefathers, socrates, and, plato, aristotle, posited, the, existence, of, natural, justice, or, natural, right, dikaion, physikon, latin, ius, naturale, his, association, with, natural, law, is, largely, due, to, how, he, was, interpreted, by, thomas, aquinas, this, was, based, on, aquinas, conflation, of, natural, law, and, natural, right, the, latter, of, which, aristotle, posits, in, book, v, of, the, nicomachean, ethics, book, iv, of, the, eudemian, ethics, aquinas, s, influence, was, such, as, to, affect, a, number, of, early, translations, of, these, passages, though, more, recent, translations, render, them, more, literally, aristotle, s, theory, of, justice, is, bound, up, in, his, idea, of, the, golden, mean, indeed, his, treatment, of, what, he, calls, political, justice, derives, from, his, discussion, of, the, just, as, a, moral, virtue, derived, as, the, mean, between, opposing, vices, just, like, every, other, virtue, he, describes, his, longest, discussion, of, his, theory, of, justice, occurs, in, nicomachean, ethics, and, begins, by, asking, what, sort, of, mean, a, just, act, is, he, argues, that, the, term, justice, actually, refers, to, two, different, but, related, ideas, general, justice, and, particular, justice, when, a, person, s, actions, toward, others, are, completely, virtuous, in, all, matters, aristotle, calls, them, just, in, the, sense, of, general, justice, as, such, this, idea, of, justice, is, more, or, less, coextensive, with, virtue, particular, or, partial, justice, by, contrast, is, the, part, of, general, justice, or, the, individual, virtue, that, is, concerned, with, treating, others, equitably, aristotle, moves, from, this, unqualified, discussion, of, justice, to, a, qualified, view, of, political, justice, by, which, he, means, something, close, to, the, subject, of, modern, jurisprudence, of, political, justice, aristotle, argues, that, it, is, partly, derived, from, nature, and, partly, a, matter, of, convention, this, can, be, taken, as, a, statement, that, is, similar, to, the, views, of, modern, natural, law, theorists, but, it, must, also, be, remembered, that, aristotle, is, describing, a, view, of, morality, not, a, system, of, law, and, therefore, his, remarks, as, to, nature, are, about, the, grounding, of, the, morality, enacted, as, law, not, the, laws, themselves, the, best, evidence, of, aristotle, s, having, thought, there, was, a, natural, law, comes, from, the, rhetoric, where, aristotle, notes, that, aside, from, the, particular, laws, that, each, people, has, set, up, for, itself, there, is, a, common, law, that, is, according, to, nature, the, context, of, this, remark, however, suggests, only, that, aristotle, thought, that, it, could, be, rhetorically, advantageous, to, appeal, to, such, a, law, especially, when, the, particular, law, of, one, s, own, city, was, adverse, to, the, case, being, made, not, that, there, actually, was, such, a, law, aristotle, moreover, considered, certain, candidates, for, a, universally, valid, natural, law, to, be, wrong, aristotle, s, theoretical, paternity, of, the, natural, law, tradition, is, consequently, disputed, thomas, aquinas, is, the, foremost, classical, proponent, of, natural, theology, and, the, father, of, the, thomistic, school, of, philosophy, for, a, long, time, the, primary, philosophical, approach, of, the, roman, catholic, church, the, work, for, which, he, is, best, known, is, the, summa, theologiae, one, of, the, thirty, five, doctors, of, the, church, he, is, considered, by, many, catholics, to, be, the, church, s, greatest, theologian, consequently, many, institutions, of, learning, have, been, named, after, him, aquinas, distinguished, four, kinds, of, law, eternal, natural, divine, and, human, natural, law, is, based, on, first, principles, this, is, the, first, precept, of, the, law, that, good, is, to, be, done, and, promoted, and, evil, is, to, be, avoided, all, other, precepts, of, the, natural, law, are, based, on, this, the, desires, to, live, and, to, procreate, are, counted, by, aquinas, among, those, basic, natural, human, values, on, which, all, other, human, values, are, based, francisco, de, vitoria, was, perhaps, the, first, to, develop, a, theory, of, ius, gentium, the, rights, of, peoples, and, thus, is, an, important, figure, in, the, transition, to, modernity, he, extrapolated, his, ideas, of, legitimate, sovereign, power, to, international, affairs, concluding, that, such, affairs, ought, to, be, determined, by, forms, respecting, of, the, rights, of, all, and, that, the, common, good, of, the, world, should, take, precedence, before, the, good, of, any, single, state, this, meant, that, relations, between, states, ought, to, pass, from, being, justified, by, force, to, being, justified, by, law, and, justice, some, scholars, have, upset, the, standard, account, of, the, origins, of, international, law, which, emphasises, the, seminal, text, de, iure, belli, ac, pacis, by, hugo, grotius, and, argued, for, vitoria, and, later, su, rez, s, importance, as, forerunners, and, potentially, founders, of, the, field, others, such, as, koskenniemi, have, argued, that, none, of, these, humanist, and, scholastic, thinkers, can, be, understood, to, have, founded, international, law, in, the, modern, sense, instead, placing, its, origins, in, the, post, 1870, period, francisco, su, rez, regarded, as, among, the, greatest, scholastics, after, aquinas, subdivided, the, concept, of, ius, gentium, working, with, already, well, formed, categories, he, carefully, distinguished, ius, inter, gentes, from, ius, intra, gentes, ius, inter, gentes, which, corresponds, to, modern, international, law, was, something, common, to, the, majority, of, countries, although, being, positive, law, not, natural, law, it, was, not, necessarily, universal, on, the, other, hand, ius, intra, gentes, or, civil, law, is, specific, to, each, nation, writing, after, world, war, ii, lon, l, fuller, defended, a, secular, and, procedural, form, of, natural, law, he, emphasised, that, the, natural, law, must, meet, certain, formal, requirements, such, as, being, impartial, and, publicly, knowable, to, the, extent, that, an, institutional, system, of, social, control, falls, short, of, these, requirements, fuller, argued, we, are, less, inclined, to, recognise, it, as, a, system, of, law, or, to, give, it, our, respect, thus, the, law, must, have, a, morality, that, goes, beyond, the, societal, rules, under, which, laws, are, made, sophisticated, positivist, and, natural, law, theories, sometimes, resemble, each, other, and, may, have, certain, points, in, common, identifying, a, particular, theorist, as, a, positivist, or, a, natural, law, theorist, sometimes, involves, matters, of, emphasis, and, degree, and, the, particular, influences, on, the, theorist, s, work, the, natural, law, theorists, of, the, distant, past, such, as, aquinas, and, john, locke, made, no, distinction, between, analytic, and, normative, jurisprudence, while, modern, natural, law, theorists, such, as, john, finnis, who, claim, to, be, positivists, still, argue, that, law, is, moral, by, nature, in, his, book, natural, law, and, natural, rights, 1980, 2011, john, finnis, provides, a, restatement, of, natural, law, doctrine, analytic, or, clarificatory, jurisprudence, means, taking, a, neutral, point, of, view, and, using, descriptive, language, when, referring, to, various, aspects, of, legal, systems, this, was, a, philosophical, development, that, rejected, natural, law, s, fusing, of, what, law, is, and, what, it, ought, to, be, david, hume, argued, in, a, treatise, of, human, nature, that, people, invariably, slip, from, describing, what, the, world, is, to, asserting, that, we, therefore, ought, to, follow, a, particular, course, of, action, but, as, a, matter, of, pure, logic, one, cannot, conclude, that, we, ought, to, do, something, merely, because, something, is, the, case, so, analysing, and, clarifying, the, way, the, world, is, must, be, treated, as, a, strictly, separate, question, from, normative, and, evaluative, questions, of, what, ought, to, be, done, the, most, important, questions, of, analytic, jurisprudence, are, what, are, laws, what, is, the, law, what, is, the, relationship, between, law, and, power, sociology, and, what, is, the, relationship, between, law, and, morality, legal, positivism, is, the, dominant, theory, although, there, is, a, growing, number, of, critics, who, offer, their, own, interpretations, historical, jurisprudence, came, to, prominence, during, the, debate, on, the, proposed, codification, of, german, law, in, his, book, on, the, vocation, of, our, age, for, legislation, and, jurisprudence, friedrich, carl, von, savigny, argued, that, germany, did, not, have, a, legal, language, that, would, support, codification, because, the, traditions, customs, and, beliefs, of, the, german, people, did, not, include, a, belief, in, a, code, historicists, believe, that, law, originates, with, society, an, effort, to, systematically, inform, jurisprudence, from, sociological, insights, developed, from, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, as, sociology, began, to, establish, itself, as, a, distinct, social, science, especially, in, the, united, states, and, in, continental, europe, in, germany, austria, and, france, the, work, of, the, free, law, theorists, e, g, ernst, fuchs, hermann, kantorowicz, eugen, ehrlich, and, fran, ois, g, ny, encouraged, the, use, of, sociological, insights, in, the, development, of, legal, and, juristic, theory, the, most, internationally, influential, advocacy, for, a, sociological, jurisprudence, occurred, in, the, united, states, where, throughout, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, roscoe, pound, for, many, years, the, dean, of, harvard, law, school, used, this, term, to, characterise, his, legal, philosophy, in, the, united, states, many, later, writers, followed, pound, s, lead, or, developed, distinctive, approaches, to, sociological, jurisprudence, in, australia, julius, stone, strongly, defended, and, developed, pound, s, ideas, in, the, 1930s, a, significant, split, between, the, sociological, jurists, and, the, american, legal, realists, emerged, in, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, sociological, jurisprudence, as, a, distinct, movement, declined, as, jurisprudence, came, more, strongly, under, the, influence, of, analytical, legal, philosophy, but, with, increasing, criticism, of, dominant, orientations, of, legal, philosophy, in, english, speaking, countries, in, the, present, century, it, has, attracted, renewed, interest, increasingly, its, contemporary, focus, is, on, providing, theoretical, resources, for, jurists, to, aid, their, understanding, of, new, types, of, regulation, for, example, the, diverse, kinds, of, developing, transnational, law, and, the, increasingly, important, interrelations, of, law, and, culture, especially, in, multicultural, western, societies, legal, positivism, is, the, view, that, the, content, of, law, is, dependent, on, social, facts, and, that, a, legal, system, s, existence, is, not, constrained, by, morality, within, legal, positivism, theorists, agree, that, law, s, content, is, a, product, of, social, facts, but, theorists, disagree, whether, law, s, validity, can, be, explained, by, incorporating, moral, values, legal, positivists, who, argue, against, the, incorporation, of, moral, values, to, explain, law, s, validity, are, labeled, exclusive, or, hard, legal, positivists, joseph, raz, s, legal, positivism, is, an, example, of, exclusive, legal, positivism, legal, positivists, who, argue, that, law, s, validity, can, be, explained, by, incorporating, moral, values, are, labeled, inclusive, or, soft, legal, positivists, the, legal, positivist, theories, of, h, l, a, hart, and, jules, coleman, are, examples, of, inclusive, legal, positivism, hobbes, was, a, social, contractarian, and, believed, that, the, law, had, peoples, tacit, consent, he, believed, that, society, was, formed, from, a, state, of, nature, to, protect, people, from, the, state, of, war, that, would, exist, otherwise, in, leviathan, hobbes, argues, that, without, an, ordered, society, life, would, be, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, it, is, commonly, said, that, hobbes, s, views, on, human, nature, were, influenced, by, his, times, the, english, civil, war, and, the, cromwellian, dictatorship, had, taken, place, and, in, reacting, to, that, hobbes, felt, that, absolute, authority, vested, in, a, monarch, whose, subjects, obeyed, the, law, was, the, basis, of, a, civilized, society, john, austin, and, jeremy, bentham, were, early, legal, positivists, who, sought, to, provide, a, descriptive, account, of, law, that, describes, the, law, as, it, is, austin, explained, the, descriptive, focus, for, legal, positivism, by, saying, the, existence, of, law, is, one, thing, its, merit, and, demerit, another, whether, it, be, or, be, not, is, one, enquiry, whether, it, be, or, be, not, conformable, to, an, assumed, standard, is, a, different, enquiry, for, austin, and, bentham, a, society, is, governed, by, a, sovereign, who, has, de, facto, authority, through, the, sovereign, s, authority, come, laws, which, for, austin, and, bentham, are, commands, backed, by, sanctions, for, non, compliance, along, with, hume, bentham, was, an, early, and, staunch, supporter, of, the, utilitarian, concept, and, was, an, avid, prison, reformer, advocate, for, democracy, and, firm, atheist, bentham, s, views, about, law, and, jurisprudence, were, popularized, by, his, student, john, austin, austin, was, the, first, chair, of, law, at, the, new, university, of, london, from, 1829, austin, s, utilitarian, answer, to, what, is, law, was, that, law, is, commands, backed, by, threat, of, sanctions, from, a, sovereign, to, whom, people, have, a, habit, of, obedience, h, l, a, hart, criticized, austin, and, bentham, s, early, legal, positivism, because, the, command, theory, failed, to, account, for, individual, s, compliance, with, the, law, hans, kelsen, is, considered, one, of, the, preeminent, jurists, of, the, 20th, century, and, has, been, highly, influential, in, europe, and, latin, america, although, less, so, in, common, law, countries, his, pure, theory, of, law, describes, law, as, binding, norms, while, at, the, same, time, refusing, to, evaluate, those, norms, that, is, legal, science, is, to, be, separated, from, legal, politics, central, to, the, pure, theory, of, law, is, the, notion, of, a, basic, norm, grundnorm, a, hypothetical, norm, presupposed, by, the, jurist, from, which, all, lower, norms, in, the, hierarchy, of, a, legal, system, beginning, with, constitutional, law, are, understood, to, derive, their, authority, or, the, extent, to, which, they, are, binding, kelsen, contends, that, the, extent, to, which, legal, norms, are, binding, their, specifically, legal, character, can, be, understood, without, tracing, it, ultimately, to, some, suprahuman, source, such, as, god, personified, nature, or, of, great, importance, in, his, time, a, personified, state, or, nation, in, the, english, speaking, world, the, most, influential, legal, positivist, of, the, twentieth, century, was, h, l, a, hart, professor, of, jurisprudence, at, oxford, university, hart, argued, that, the, law, should, be, understood, as, a, system, of, social, rules, in, the, concept, of, law, hart, rejected, kelsen, s, views, that, sanctions, were, essential, to, law, and, that, a, normative, social, phenomenon, like, law, cannot, be, grounded, in, non, normative, social, facts, hart, claimed, that, law, is, the, union, of, primary, rules, and, secondary, rules, primary, rules, require, individuals, to, act, or, not, act, in, certain, ways, and, create, duties, for, the, governed, to, obey, secondary, rules, are, rules, that, confer, authority, to, create, new, primary, rules, or, modify, existing, ones, secondary, rules, are, divided, into, rules, of, adjudication, how, to, resolve, legal, disputes, rules, of, change, how, laws, are, amended, and, the, rule, of, recognition, how, laws, are, identified, as, valid, the, validity, of, a, legal, system, comes, from, the, rule, of, recognition, which, is, a, customary, practice, of, officials, especially, barristers, and, judges, who, identify, certain, acts, and, decisions, as, sources, of, law, in, 1981, neil, maccormick, wrote, a, pivotal, book, on, hart, second, edition, published, in, 2008, which, further, refined, and, offered, some, important, criticisms, that, led, maccormick, to, develop, his, own, theory, the, best, example, of, which, is, his, institutions, of, law, 2007, other, important, critiques, include, those, of, ronald, dworkin, john, finnis, and, joseph, raz, in, recent, years, debates, on, the, nature, of, law, have, become, increasingly, fine, grained, one, important, debate, is, within, legal, positivism, one, school, is, sometimes, called, exclusive, legal, positivism, and, is, associated, with, the, view, that, the, legal, validity, of, a, norm, can, never, depend, on, its, moral, correctness, a, second, school, is, labeled, inclusive, legal, positivism, a, major, proponent, of, which, is, wil, waluchow, and, is, associated, with, the, view, that, moral, considerations, may, but, do, not, necessarily, determine, the, legal, validity, of, a, norm, joseph, raz, s, theory, of, legal, positivism, argues, against, the, incorporation, of, moral, values, to, explain, law, s, validity, in, raz, s, 1979, book, the, authority, of, law, he, criticised, what, he, called, the, weak, social, thesis, to, explain, law, he, formulates, the, weak, social, thesis, as, a, sometimes, the, identification, of, some, laws, turn, on, moral, arguments, but, also, with, b, in, all, legal, systems, the, identification, of, some, law, turns, on, moral, argument, raz, argues, that, law, s, authority, is, identifiable, purely, through, social, sources, without, reference, to, moral, reasoning, this, view, he, calls, the, sources, thesis, raz, suggests, that, any, categorisation, of, rules, beyond, their, role, as, authority, is, better, left, to, sociology, than, to, jurisprudence, some, philosophers, used, to, contend, that, positivism, was, the, theory, that, held, that, there, was, no, necessary, connection, between, law, and, morality, but, influential, contemporary, positivists, including, joseph, raz, john, gardner, and, leslie, green, reject, that, view, raz, claims, it, is, a, necessary, truth, that, there, are, vices, that, a, legal, system, cannot, possibly, have, for, example, it, cannot, commit, rape, or, murder, legal, realism, is, the, view, that, a, theory, of, law, should, be, descriptive, and, account, for, the, reasons, why, judges, decide, cases, as, they, do, legal, realism, had, some, affinities, with, the, sociology, of, law, and, sociological, jurisprudence, the, essential, tenet, of, legal, realism, is, that, all, law, is, made, by, humans, and, thus, should, account, for, reasons, besides, legal, rules, that, led, to, a, legal, decision, there, are, two, separate, schools, of, legal, realism, american, legal, realism, and, scandinavian, legal, realism, american, legal, realism, grew, out, of, the, writings, of, oliver, wendell, holmes, at, the, start, of, holmes, s, the, common, law, he, claims, that, he, life, of, the, law, has, not, been, logic, it, has, been, experience, this, view, was, a, reaction, to, legal, formalism, that, was, popular, the, time, due, to, the, christopher, columbus, langdell, holmes, s, writings, on, jurisprudence, also, laid, the, foundations, for, the, predictive, theory, of, law, in, his, article, the, path, of, the, law, holmes, argues, that, the, object, of, study, is, prediction, the, prediction, of, the, incidence, of, the, public, force, through, the, instrumentality, of, the, courts, for, the, american, legal, realists, of, the, early, twentieth, century, legal, realism, sought, to, describe, the, way, judges, decide, cases, for, legal, realists, such, as, jerome, frank, judges, start, with, the, facts, before, them, and, then, move, to, legal, principles, before, legal, realism, theories, of, jurisprudence, turned, this, method, around, where, judges, were, thought, to, begin, with, legal, principles, and, then, look, to, facts, it, has, become, common, today, to, identify, justice, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, as, the, main, precursor, of, american, legal, realism, other, influences, include, roscoe, pound, karl, llewellyn, and, justice, benjamin, cardozo, karl, llewellyn, another, founder, of, the, u, s, legal, realism, movement, similarly, believed, that, the, law, is, little, more, than, putty, in, the, hands, of, judges, who, are, able, to, shape, the, outcome, of, cases, based, on, their, personal, values, or, policy, choices, the, scandinavian, school, of, legal, realism, argued, that, law, can, be, explained, through, the, empirical, methods, used, by, social, scientists, prominent, scandinavian, legal, realists, are, alf, ross, axel, h, gerstr, m, and, karl, olivecrona, scandinavian, legal, realists, also, took, a, naturalist, approach, to, law, despite, its, decline, in, popularity, legal, realism, continues, to, influence, a, wide, spectrum, of, jurisprudential, schools, today, including, critical, legal, studies, feminist, legal, theory, critical, race, theory, sociology, of, law, and, law, and, economics, critical, legal, studies, are, a, new, theory, of, jurisprudence, that, has, developed, since, the, 1970s, the, theory, can, generally, be, traced, to, american, legal, realism, and, is, considered, the, first, movement, in, legal, theory, and, legal, scholarship, in, the, united, states, to, have, espoused, a, committed, left, political, stance, and, perspective, it, holds, that, the, law, is, largely, contradictory, and, can, be, best, analyzed, as, an, expression, of, the, policy, goals, of, a, dominant, social, group, american, legal, philosopher, ronald, dworkin, s, legal, theory, attacks, legal, positivists, that, separate, law, s, content, from, morality, in, his, book, law, s, empire, dworkin, argued, that, law, is, an, interpretive, concept, that, requires, barristers, to, find, the, best, fitting, and, most, just, solution, to, a, legal, dispute, given, their, constitutional, traditions, according, to, him, law, is, not, entirely, based, on, social, facts, but, includes, the, best, moral, justification, for, the, institutional, facts, and, practices, that, form, a, society, s, legal, tradition, it, follows, from, dworkin, s, view, that, one, cannot, know, whether, a, society, has, a, legal, system, in, force, or, what, any, of, its, laws, are, until, one, knows, some, truths, about, the, moral, justifications, of, the, social, and, political, practices, of, that, society, it, is, consistent, with, dworkin, s, view, in, contrast, with, the, views, of, legal, positivists, or, legal, realists, that, no, one, in, a, society, may, know, what, its, laws, are, because, no, one, may, know, the, best, moral, justification, for, its, practices, interpretation, according, to, dworkin, s, integrity, theory, of, law, has, two, dimensions, to, count, as, an, interpretation, the, reading, of, a, text, must, meet, the, criterion, of, fit, of, those, interpretations, that, fit, however, dworkin, maintains, that, the, correct, interpretation, is, the, one, that, portrays, the, practices, of, the, community, in, their, best, light, or, makes, them, the, best, that, they, can, be, but, many, writers, have, doubted, whether, there, is, a, single, best, moral, justification, for, the, complex, practices, of, any, given, community, and, others, have, doubted, whether, even, if, there, is, it, should, be, counted, as, part, of, the, law, of, that, community, consequences, of, the, operation, of, legal, rules, or, legal, procedures, or, of, the, behavior, of, legal, actors, such, as, lawyers, and, judges, may, be, either, beneficial, therapeutic, or, harmful, anti, therapeutic, to, people, therapeutic, jurisprudence,

immanuel, kant, formulated, one, influential, deontological, theory, of, law, he, argued, that, any, rule, we, follow, must, be, able, to, be, universally, applied, i, e, we, must, be, willing, for, everyone, to, follow, that, rule, a, contemporary, deontological, approach, can, be, found, in, the, work, of, the, legal, philosopher, ronald, dworkin, utilitarianism, is, the, view, that, the, laws, should, be, crafted, so, as, to, produce, the, best, consequences, for, the, greatest, number, of, people, historically, utilitarian, thinking, about, law, has, been, associated, with, the, philosopher, jeremy, bentham, john, stuart, mill, was, a, pupil, of, bentham, s, and, was, the, torch, bearer, for, utilitarian, philosophy, throughout, the, late, nineteenth, century, in, contemporary, legal, theory, the, utilitarian, approach, is, frequently, championed, by, scholars, who, work, in, the, law, and, economics, tradition, john, rawls, was, an, american, philosopher, a, professor, of, political, philosophy, at, harvard, university, and, author, of, a, theory, of, justice, 1971, political, liberalism, justice, as, fairness, a, restatement, and, the, law, of, peoples, he, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, most, important, english, language, political, philosophers, of, the, 20th, century, his, theory, of, justice, uses, a, method, called, original, position, to, ask, us, which, principles, of, justice, we, would, choose, to, regulate, the, basic, institutions, of, our, society, if, we, were, behind, a, veil, of, ignorance, imagine, we, do, not, know, who, we, are, our, race, sex, wealth, status, class, or, any, distinguishing, feature, so, that, we, would, not, be, biased, in, our, own, favour, rawls, argued, from, this, original, position, that, we, would, choose, exactly, the, same, political, liberties, for, everyone, like, freedom, of, speech, the, right, to, vote, and, so, on, also, we, would, choose, a, system, where, there, is, only, inequality, because, that, produces, incentives, enough, for, the, economic, well, being, of, all, society, especially, the, poorest, this, is, rawls, s, famous, difference, principle, justice, is, fairness, in, the, sense, that, the, fairness, of, the, original, position, of, choice, guarantees, the, fairness, of, the, principles, chosen, in, that, position, there, are, many, other, normative, approaches, to, the, philosophy, of, law, including, constitutionalism, critical, legal, studies, and, libertarian, theories, of, law
