several, psychological, disorders, related, to, love, such, as, erotomania, throughout, history, philosophy, and, religion, have, speculated, about, the, phenomenon, of, love, in, the, 20th, century, the, science, of, psychology, has, studied, the, subject, the, sciences, of, anthropology, neuroscience, and, biology, have, also, added, to, the, understanding, of, the, concept, of, love, biological, models, of, sex, tend, to, view, love, as, a, mammalian, drive, much, like, hunger, or, thirst, helen, fisher, an, anthropologist, and, human, behavior, researcher, divides, the, experience, of, love, into, three, partly, overlapping, stages, lust, attraction, and, attachment, lust, is, the, feeling, of, sexual, desire, romantic, attraction, determines, what, partners, find, attractive, and, pursue, conserving, time, and, energy, by, choosing, and, attachment, involves, sharing, a, home, parental, duties, mutual, defense, and, in, humans, involves, feelings, of, safety, and, security, three, distinct, neural, circuitries, including, neurotransmitters, and, three, behavioral, patterns, are, associated, with, these, three, romantic, styles, lust, is, the, initial, passionate, sexual, desire, that, promotes, mating, and, involves, the, increased, release, of, hormones, such, as, testosterone, and, estrogen, these, effects, rarely, last, more, than, a, few, weeks, or, months, attraction, is, the, more, individualized, and, romantic, desire, for, a, specific, candidate, for, mating, which, develops, out, of, lust, as, commitment, to, an, individual, mate, form, recent, studies, in, neuroscience, have, indicated, that, as, people, fall, in, love, the, brain, consistently, releases, a, certain, set, of, chemicals, including, the, neurotransmitter, hormones, dopamine, norepinephrine, and, serotonin, the, same, compounds, released, by, amphetamine, stimulating, the, brain, s, pleasure, center, and, leading, to, side, effects, such, as, increased, heart, rate, reduced, appetite, and, sleep, and, an, intense, feeling, of, excitement, research, indicates, that, this, stage, generally, lasts, from, one, and, a, half, to, three, years, since, the, lust, and, attraction, stages, are, both, considered, temporary, a, third, stage, is, needed, to, account, for, long, term, relationships, attachment, is, the, bonding, that, promotes, relationships, lasting, for, many, years, and, even, decades, attachment, is, generally, based, on, commitments, such, as, marriage, and, children, or, mutual, friendship, based, on, things, like, shared, interests, it, has, been, linked, to, higher, levels, of, the, chemicals, oxytocin, and, vasopressin, to, a, greater, degree, than, what, is, found, in, short, term, relationships, enzo, emanuele, and, coworkers, reported, the, protein, molecule, known, as, the, nerve, growth, factor, ngf, has, high, levels, when, people, first, fall, in, love, but, these, return, to, previous, levels, after, one, year, psychology, depicts, love, as, a, cognitive, and, social, phenomenon, psychologist, robert, sternberg, formulated, a, triangular, theory, of, love, in, which, love, has, three, components, intimacy, commitment, and, passion, intimacy, is, when, two, people, share, confidences, and, various, details, of, their, personal, lives, and, is, usually, shown, in, friendships, and, romantic, love, affairs, commitment, is, the, expectation, that, the, relationship, is, permanent, passionate, love, is, shown, in, infatuation, as, well, as, romantic, love, all, forms, of, love, are, viewed, as, varying, combinations, of, these, three, components, non, love, does, not, include, any, of, these, components, liking, only, includes, intimacy, infatuated, love, only, includes, passion, empty, love, only, includes, commitment, romantic, love, includes, both, intimacy, and, passion, companionate, love, includes, intimacy, and, commitment, fatuous, love, includes, passion, and, commitment, consummate, love, includes, all, three, components, american, psychologist, zick, rubin, sought, to, define, love, by, psychometrics, in, the, 1970s, his, work, identifies, a, different, set, of, three, factors, that, constitute, love, attachment, caring, and, intimacy, following, developments, in, electrical, theories, such, as, coulomb, s, law, which, showed, that, positive, and, negative, charges, attract, analogs, in, human, life, were, envisioned, such, as, opposites, attract, research, on, human, mating, has, generally, found, this, not, to, be, true, when, it, comes, to, character, and, personality, people, tend, to, like, people, similar, to, themselves, however, in, a, few, unusual, and, specific, domains, such, as, immune, systems, it, seems, that, humans, prefer, others, who, are, unlike, themselves, e, g, with, an, orthogonal, immune, system, perhaps, because, this, will, lead, to, a, baby, that, has, the, best, of, both, worlds, in, recent, years, various, human, bonding, theories, have, been, developed, described, in, terms, of, attachments, ties, bonds, and, affinities, some, western, authorities, disaggregate, into, two, main, components, the, altruistic, and, the, narcissistic, this, view, is, represented, in, the, works, of, scott, peck, whose, work, in, the, field, of, applied, psychology, explored, the, definitions, of, love, and, evil, peck, maintains, that, love, is, a, combination, of, the, concern, for, the, spiritual, growth, of, another, and, simple, narcissism, in, combination, love, is, an, activity, not, simply, a, feeling, psychologist, erich, fromm, maintained, in, his, book, the, art, of, loving, that, love, is, not, merely, a, feeling, but, is, also, actions, and, that, in, fact, the, feeling, of, love, is, superficial, in, comparison, to, one, s, commitment, to, love, via, a, series, of, loving, actions, over, time, fromm, held, that, love, is, ultimately, not, a, feeling, at, all, but, rather, is, a, commitment, to, and, adherence, to, loving, actions, towards, another, oneself, or, many, others, over, a, sustained, duration, fromm, also, described, love, as, a, conscious, choice, that, in, its, early, stages, might, originate, as, an, involuntary, feeling, but, which, then, later, no, longer, depends, on, those, feelings, but, rather, depends, only, on, conscious, commitment, evolutionary, psychology, has, attempted, to, provide, various, reasons, for, love, as, a, survival, tool, humans, are, dependent, on, parental, help, for, a, large, portion, of, their, lifespans, compared, to, other, mammals, love, has, therefore, been, seen, as, a, mechanism, to, promote, parental, support, of, children, for, this, extended, time, period, furthermore, researchers, as, early, as, charles, darwin, identified, unique, features, of, human, love, compared, to, other, mammals, and, credited, love, as, a, major, factor, for, creating, social, support, systems, that, enabled, the, development, and, expansion, of, the, human, species, another, factor, may, be, that, sexually, transmitted, diseases, can, cause, among, other, effects, permanently, reduced, fertility, injury, to, the, fetus, and, increase, complications, during, childbirth, this, would, favor, monogamous, relationships, over, polygamy, interpersonal, love, between, a, man, and, woman, provides, an, evolutionary, adaptive, benefit, since, it, facilitates, mating, and, sexual, reproduction, however, some, organisms, can, reproduce, asexually, without, mating, understanding, the, adaptive, benefit, of, interpersonal, love, depends, on, understanding, the, adaptive, benefit, of, sexual, reproduction, as, opposed, to, asexual, reproduction, richard, michod, reviewed, evidence, that, love, and, consequently, sexual, reproduction, provides, two, major, adaptive, advantages, first, sexual, reproduction, facilitates, repair, of, damages, in, the, dna, that, is, passed, from, parent, to, progeny, during, meiosis, a, key, stage, of, the, sexual, process, second, a, gene, in, either, parent, may, contain, a, harmful, mutation, but, in, the, progeny, produced, by, sexual, reproduction, expression, of, a, harmful, mutation, introduced, by, one, parent, is, likely, to, be, masked, by, expression, of, the, unaffected, homologous, gene, from, the, other, parent, biological, models, of, love, tend, to, see, it, as, a, mammalian, drive, similar, to, hunger, or, thirst, psychology, sees, love, as, more, of, a, social, and, cultural, phenomenon, love, is, influenced, by, hormones, such, as, oxytocin, neurotrophins, such, as, ngf, and, pheromones, and, how, people, think, and, behave, in, love, is, influenced, by, their, conceptions, of, love, the, conventional, view, in, biology, is, that, there, are, two, major, drives, in, love, sexual, attraction, and, attachment, attachment, between, adults, is, presumed, to, work, on, the, same, principles, that, lead, an, infant, to, become, attached, to, its, mother, the, traditional, psychological, view, sees, love, as, being, a, combination, of, companionate, love, and, passionate, love, passionate, love, is, intense, longing, and, is, often, accompanied, by, physiological, arousal, shortness, of, breath, rapid, heart, rate, companionate, love, is, affection, and, a, feeling, of, intimacy, not, accompanied, by, physiological, arousal, love, plays, a, role, in, human, well, being, and, health, engaging, in, activities, associated, with, love, such, as, nurturing, relationships, has, been, shown, to, activate, key, brain, regions, responsible, for, emotion, attention, motivation, and, memory, these, activities, also, contribute, to, the, regulation, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, leading, to, stress, reduction, over, time, although, the, initial, stages, of, love, may, induce, stress, love, s, social, bonds, enhance, both, physical, and, mental, health, fostering, resilience, compassion, and, closeness, it, boosts, immune, function, and, promotes, healing, while, also, encouraging, positive, motivations, and, behaviors, for, individual, flourishing, and, survival, breakups, can, evoke, a, range, of, emotional, states, including, distrust, rejection, and, anger, leading, to, trauma, and, various, psychological, challenges, such, as, anxiety, social, withdrawal, and, even, love, addiction, individuals, may, become, fixated, on, past, relationships, perpetuating, emotional, distress, akin, to, addiction, health, benefits, grow, bigger, when, married, couples, are, older, this, is, because, the, partners, play, a, crucial, role, in, promoting, each, other, s, well, being, a, loving, relationship, with, god, has, significant, impact, on, health, greek, distinguishes, several, different, senses, in, which, the, word, love, is, used, ancient, greeks, identified, three, main, forms, of, love, friendship, and, or, platonic, desire, philia, sexual, and, or, romantic, desire, eros, and, self, emptying, or, divine, love, agape, modern, authors, have, distinguished, further, varieties, of, romantic, love, in, latin, friendship, was, distinctly, termed, amicitia, while, amor, encompassed, erotic, passion, familial, attachment, and, albeit, less, commonly, the, affection, between, friends, cicero, in, his, essay, on, friendship, reflects, on, the, innate, human, tendency, to, both, love, oneself, and, seek, out, another, with, whom, to, intertwine, minds, nearly, blending, them, into, a, singular, entity, this, suggests, that, while, friends, remain, distinct, individuals, they, also, in, some, sense, become, intertwined, embodying, a, shared, essence, lucretius, perceives, love, as, a, disruptive, and, irrational, force, leading, to, madness, and, despair, to, him, it, is, an, affliction, distorting, reality, a, primal, urge, rooted, in, the, biological, need, for, species, to, propagate, he, emphasizes, love, s, futility, and, self, destructive,

divine, ren, s, significance, lies, in, its, ability, to, foster, genuine, human, connection, and, empathy, laying, the, foundation, for, harmonious, relationships, within, society, mozi, a, chinese, philosopher, articulated, a, philosophy, centered, on, the, principle, of, universal, love, at, the, core, of, his, teachings, lay, the, belief, that, genuine, harmony, and, societal, well, being,

imperative, requiring, individuals, to, actively, promote, the, welfare, of, all, members, of, society, through, their, actions, in, mozi, s, philosophical, framework, universal, love, was, not, only, a, moral, obligation, but, also, a, divine, principle, originating, from, heaven, itself, he, argued, that, this, principle, was, exemplified, through, the, actions, of, sage, kings, from, ancient, times, who, demonstrated, how, love, could, manifest, in, tangible, ways, within, human, interactions, mozi, s, advocacy, for, universal, love, extended, beyond, interpersonal, relationships, he,

distinguished, love, as, a, union, love, as, robust, concern, love, as, valuing, and, love, as, an, emotion, love, as, a, union, suggests, that, love, involves, the, formation, of, a, union, between, the, two, individuals, creating, a, we, roger, scruton, and, mark, fisher, emphasize, the, union, of, concerns, where, the, distinction, between, the, lover, s, different, interests, disappears, and, a, new, shared, care, and, concern, emerges, robert, c, solomon, views, love, as, a, literal, fusion, between, the, two, individuals, resulting, in, a, shared, identity, and, mutual, definition, robert, nozick, argues, that, love, creates, a, new, we, through, the, pooling, of, well, being, and, autonomy, as, well, as, the, adoption, of, a, joint, identity, critics, argue, that, love, as, a, union, undermines, individual, autonomy, and, the, lovers, become, unintelligible, however, nozick, and, fisher, claim, that, this, loss, is, a, desirable, aspect, of, love, michael, friedman, proposes, a, federation, model, where, love, creates, a, new, unified, entity, without, erasing, individual, identities, thus, allowing, for, the, concern, for, the, beloved, s, sake, love, as, a, robust, concern, posits, that, love, is, primarily, defined, by, caring, about, the, beloved, s, sake, without, creating, a, we, or, any, type, of, union, between, the, lovers, this, perspective, emphasizes, the, willing, aspect, of, love, where, one, s, desire, and, motivations, are, shaped, by, concern, for, the, beloved, s, well, being, critics, of, this, view, argue, that, the, definition, is, too, passive, in, the, sense, that, the, conception, of, the, beloved, overlooks, the, interactive, nature, of, love, as, well, as, the, emotional, responsiveness, to, the, beloved, however, defenders, argue, that, promoting, the, beloved, s, well, being, requires, respecting, their, autonomy, and, emotional, responses, furthermore, critics, claim, that, the, robust, concern, focus, solely, on, desires, and, concerns, for, the, beloved, s, welfare, making, it, too, strict, of, a, definition, defenders, counter, that, the, desire, for, the, beloved, s, well, being, is, an, essential, aspect, to, love, monique, wonderly, suggests, that, the, concept, of, attachment, can, complement, the, robust, concern, view, capturing, the, idea, that, the, beloved, is, not, only, important, for, their, own, sake, but, also, to, the, lover, love, as, valuing, has, two, main, approaches, love, as, appraisal, of, value, and, love, as, bestowal, of, value, j, david, velleman, proposes, that, the, former, involves, acknowledging, and, responding, uniquely, to, the, value, of, the, beloved, kantian, distinctions, are, drawn, between, dignity, and, price, dignity, being, that, the, value, of, something, is, not, comparable, and, price, being, that, it, is, comparable, thus, people, possess, dignity, due, to, their, rational, nature, love, on, this, view, responds, to, the, dignity, of, persons, but, it, differs, from, respect, in, that, it, disarms, emotional, defenses, making, one, vulnerable, to, the, beloved, however, critics, argue, that, velleman, s, account, struggles, to, explain, the, selectivity, and, constancy, of, love, as, well, as, the, role, of, emotions, in, appraisal, peter, singer, claims, that, love, as, a, bestowal, of, value, involves, bestowing, intrisic, value, upon, the, beloved, unlike, appraisal, which, responds, to, pre, existing, value, bestowal, creates, value, in, the, beloved, singer, argues, that, love, is, non, teleological, and, cannot, be, justified, but, rather, involves, attachment, and, commitment, to, the, beloved, however, critics, question, how, bestowal, accounts, for, the, selectivity, of, love, and, its, discerning, nature, finally, love, as, an, emotion, is, divided, in, two, perspectives, love, as, emotion, proper, and, love, as, emotion, complex, the, former, sees, love, as, a, particular, motivational, response, to, an, object, similar, to, other, emotions, however, critics, argue, that, defining, love, solely, as, an, emotion, oversimplifies, its, nature, james, robert, brown, suggests, that, love, evaluates, the, beloved, as, worthwhile, but, this, perspective, fails, to, capture, the, complexity, of, love, compared, to, other, evaluative, responses, like, admiration, or, respect, according, to, critics, love, as, emotion, complex, understands, love, as, a, complex, emotional, attitude, towards, another, person, involving, historical, patterns, concerning, of, one, s, emotional, responsiveness, to, the, beloved, it, emphasizes, the, dynamic, nature, of, love, where, the, lover, s, identity, is, continually, transformed, by, loving, the, beloved, emotional, responses, are, interconnected, and, tied, to, the, historical, narrative, of, the, relationship, annette, baier, and, neera, k, badhwar, emphasize, emotional, interdependence, while, paul, helm, suggests, that, love, involves, intimate, identification, where, sharing, the, values, of, the, beloved, is, central, critics, argue, that, these, views, do, not, answer, how, to, distinguish, loving, relationship, from, other, relationships, and, what, constitues, the, characteristic, narrative, history, of, love
