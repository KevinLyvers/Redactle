microeconomics, is, a, branch, of, economics, that, studies, the, behavior, of, individuals, and, firms, in, making, decisions, regarding, the, allocation, of, scarce, resources, and, the, interactions, among, these, individuals, and, firms, microeconomics, focuses, on, the, study, of, individual, markets, sectors, or, industries, as, opposed, to, the, economy, as, a, whole, which, is, studied, in, macroeconomics, one, goal, of, microeconomics, is, to, analyze, the, market, mechanisms, that, establish, relative, prices, among, goods, and, services, and, allocate, limited, resources, among, alternative, uses, microeconomics, shows, conditions, under, which, free, markets, lead, to, desirable, allocations, it, also, analyzes, market, failure, where, markets, fail, to, produce, efficient, results, while, microeconomics, focuses, on, firms, and, individuals, macroeconomics, focuses, on, the, total, of, economic, activity, dealing, with, the, issues, of, growth, inflation, and, unemployment, and, with, national, policies, relating, to, these, issues, microeconomics, also, deals, with, the, effects, of, economic, policies, such, as, changing, taxation, levels, on, microeconomic, behavior, and, thus, on, the, aforementioned, aspects, of, the, economy, particularly, in, the, wake, of, the, lucas, critique, much, of, modern, macroeconomic, theories, has, been, built, upon, microfoundations, i, e, based, upon, basic, assumptions, about, micro, level, behavior, microeconomic, study, historically, has, been, performed, according, to, general, equilibrium, theory, developed, by, l, on, walras, in, elements, of, pure, economics, 1874, and, partial, equilibrium, theory, introduced, by, alfred, marshall, in, principles, of, economics, 1890, microeconomic, theory, typically, begins, with, the, study, of, a, single, rational, and, utility, maximizing, individual, to, economists, rationality, means, an, individual, possesses, stable, preferences, that, are, both, complete, and, transitive, the, technical, assumption, that, preference, relations, are, continuous, is, needed, to, ensure, the, existence, of, a, utility, function, although, microeconomic, theory, can, continue, without, this, assumption, it, would, make, comparative, statics, impossible, since, there, is, no, guarantee, that, the, resulting, utility, function, would, be, differentiable, microeconomic, theory, progresses, by, defining, a, competitive, budget, set, which, is, a, subset, of, the, consumption, set, it, is, at, this, point, that, economists, make, the, technical, assumption, that, preferences, are, locally, non, satiated, without, the, assumption, of, lns, local, non, satiation, there, is, no, 100, guarantee, but, there, would, be, a, rational, rise, in, individual, utility, with, the, necessary, tools, and, assumptions, in, place, the, utility, maximization, problem, ump, is, developed, the, utility, maximization, problem, is, the, heart, of, consumer, theory, the, utility, maximization, problem, attempts, to, explain, the, action, axiom, by, imposing, rationality, axioms, on, consumer, preferences, and, then, mathematically, modeling, and, analyzing, the, consequences, the, utility, maximization, problem, serves, not, only, as, the, mathematical, foundation, of, consumer, theory, but, as, a, metaphysical, explanation, of, it, as, well, that, is, the, utility, maximization, problem, is, used, by, economists, to, not, only, explain, what, or, how, individuals, make, choices, but, why, individuals, make, choices, as, well, the, utility, maximization, problem, is, a, constrained, optimization, problem, in, which, an, individual, seeks, to, maximize, utility, subject, to, a, budget, constraint, economists, use, the, extreme, value, theorem, to, guarantee, that, a, solution, to, the, utility, maximization, problem, exists, that, is, since, the, budget, constraint, is, both, bounded, and, closed, a, solution, to, the, utility, maximization, problem, exists, economists, call, the, solution, to, the, utility, maximization, problem, a, walrasian, demand, function, or, correspondence, the, utility, maximization, problem, has, so, far, been, developed, by, taking, consumer, tastes, i, e, consumer, utility, as, primitive, however, an, alternative, way, to, develop, microeconomic, theory, is, by, taking, consumer, choice, as, primitive, this, model, of, microeconomic, theory, is, referred, to, as, revealed, preference, theory, the, theory, of, supply, and, demand, usually, assumes, that, markets, are, perfectly, competitive, this, implies, that, there, are, many, buyers, and, sellers, in, the, market, and, none, of, them, have, the, capacity, to, significantly, influence, prices, of, goods, and, services, in, many, real, life, transactions, the, assumption, fails, because, some, individual, buyers, or, sellers, have, the, ability, to, influence, prices, quite, often, a, sophisticated, analysis, is, required, to, understand, the, demand, supply, equation, of, a, good, model, however, the, theory, works, well, in, situations, meeting, these, assumptions, mainstream, economics, does, not, assume, a, priori, that, markets, are, preferable, to, other, forms, of, social, organization, in, fact, much, analysis, is, devoted, to, cases, where, market, failures, lead, to, resource, allocation, that, is, suboptimal, and, creates, deadweight, loss, a, classic, example, of, suboptimal, resource, allocation, is, that, of, a, public, good, in, such, cases, economists, may, attempt, to, find, policies, that, avoid, waste, either, directly, by, government, control, indirectly, by, regulation, that, induces, market, participants, to, act, in, a, manner, consistent, with, optimal, welfare, or, by, creating, missing, markets, to, enable, efficient, trading, where, none, had, previously, existed, this, is, studied, in, the, field, of, collective, action, and, public, choice, theory, optimal, welfare, usually, takes, on, a, paretian, norm, which, is, a, mathematical, application, of, the, kaldor, hicks, method, this, can, diverge, from, the, utilitarian, goal, of, maximizing, utility, because, it, does, not, consider, the, distribution, of, goods, between, people, market, failure, in, positive, economics, microeconomics, is, limited, in, implications, without, mixing, the, belief, of, the, economist, and, their, theory, the, demand, for, various, commodities, by, individuals, is, generally, thought, of, as, the, outcome, of, a, utility, maximizing, process, with, each, individual, trying, to, maximize, their, own, utility, under, a, budget, constraint, and, a, given, consumption, set, individuals, and, firms, need, to, allocate, limited, resources, to, ensure, all, agents, in, the, economy, are, well, off, firms, decide, which, goods, and, services, to, produce, considering, low, costs, involving, labor, materials, and, capital, as, well, as, potential, profit, margins, consumers, choose, the, good, and, services, they, want, that, will, maximize, their, happiness, taking, into, account, their, limited, wealth, the, government, can, make, these, allocation, decisions, or, they, can, be, independently, made, by, the, consumers, and, firms, for, example, in, the, former, soviet, union, the, government, played, a, part, in, informing, car, manufacturers, which, cars, to, produce, and, which, consumers, will, gain, access, to, a, car, economists, commonly, consider, themselves, microeconomists, or, macroeconomists, the, difference, between, microeconomics, and, macroeconomics, likely, was, introduced, in, 1933, by, the, norwegian, economist, ragnar, frisch, the, co, recipient, of, the, first, nobel, memorial, prize, in, economic, sciences, in, 1969, however, frisch, did, not, actually, use, the, word, microeconomics, instead, drawing, distinctions, between, micro, dynamic, and, macro, dynamic, analysis, in, a, way, similar, to, how, the, words, microeconomics, and, macroeconomics, are, used, today, the, first, known, use, of, the, term, microeconomics, in, a, published, article, was, from, pieter, de, wolff, in, 1941, who, broadened, the, term, micro, dynamics, into, microeconomics, consumer, demand, theory, relates, preferences, for, the, consumption, of, both, goods, and, services, to, the, consumption, expenditures, ultimately, this, relationship, between, preferences, and, consumption, expenditures, is, used, to, relate, preferences, to, consumer, demand, curves, the, link, between, personal, preferences, consumption, and, the, demand, curve, is, one, of, the, most, closely, studied, relations, in, economics, it, is, a, way, of, analyzing, how, consumers, may, achieve, equilibrium, between, preferences, and, expenditures, by, maximizing, utility, subject, to, consumer, budget, constraints, production, theory, is, the, study, of, production, or, the, economic, process, of, converting, inputs, into, outputs, production, uses, resources, to, create, a, good, or, service, that, is, suitable, for, use, gift, giving, in, a, gift, economy, or, exchange, in, a, market, economy, this, can, include, manufacturing, storing, shipping, and, packaging, some, economists, define, production, broadly, as, all, economic, activity, other, than, consumption, they, see, every, commercial, activity, other, than, the, final, purchase, as, some, form, of, production, the, cost, of, production, theory, of, value, states, that, the, price, of, an, object, or, condition, is, determined, by, the, sum, of, the, cost, of, the, resources, that, went, into, making, it, the, cost, can, comprise, any, of, the, factors, of, production, including, labor, capital, or, land, and, taxation, technology, can, be, viewed, either, as, a, form, of, fixed, capital, e, g, an, industrial, plant, or, circulating, capital, e, g, intermediate, goods, in, the, mathematical, model, for, the, cost, of, production, the, short, run, total, cost, is, equal, to, fixed, cost, plus, total, variable, cost, the, fixed, cost, refers, to, the, cost, that, is, incurred, regardless, of, how, much, the, firm, produces, the, variable, cost, is, a, function, of, the, quantity, of, an, object, being, produced, the, cost, function, can, be, used, to, characterize, production, through, the, duality, theory, in, economics, developed, mainly, by, ronald, shephard, 1953, 1970, and, other, scholars, sickles, zelenyuk, 2019, ch, 2, over, a, short, time, period, few, months, most, costs, are, fixed, costs, as, the, firm, will, have, to, pay, for, salaries, contracted, shipment, and, materials, used, to, produce, various, goods, over, a, longer, time, period, 2, 3, years, costs, can, become, variable, firms, can, decide, to, reduce, output, purchase, fewer, materials, and, even, sell, some, machinery, over, 10, years, most, costs, become, variable, as, workers, can, be, laid, off, or, new, machinery, can, be, bought, to, replace, the, old, machinery, sunk, costs, this, is, a, fixed, cost, that, has, already, been, incurred, and, cannot, be, recovered, an, example, of, this, can, be, in, r, d, development, like, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, hundreds, of, millions, of, dollars, are, spent, to, achieve, new, drug, breakthroughs, but, this, is, challenging, as, its, increasingly, harder, to, find, new, breakthroughs, and, meet, tighter, regulation, standards, thus, many, projects, are, written, off, leading, to, losses, of, millions, of, dollars, opportunity, cost, is, closely, related, to, the, idea, of, time, constraints, one, can, do, only, one, thing, at, a, time, which, means, that, inevitably, one, is, always, giving, up, other, things, the, opportunity, cost, of, any, activity, is, the, value, of, the, next, best, alternative, thing, one, may, have, done, instead, opportunity, cost, depends, only, on, the, value, of, the, next, best, alternative, it, does, not, matter, whether, one, has, five, alternatives, or, 5, 000, opportunity, costs, can, tell, when, not, to, do, something, as, well, as, when, to, do, something, for, example, one, may, like, waffles, but, like, chocolate, even, more, if, someone, offers, only, waffles, one, would, take, it, but, if, offered, waffles, or, chocolate, one, would, take, the, chocolate, the, opportunity, cost, of, eating, waffles, is, sacrificing, the, chance, to, eat, chocolate, because, the, cost, of, not, eating, the, chocolate, is, higher, than, the, benefits, of, eating, the, waffles, it, makes, no, sense, to, choose, waffles, of, course, if, one, chooses, chocolate, they, are, still, faced, with, the, opportunity, cost, of, giving, up, having, waffles, but, one, is, willing, to, do, that, because, the, waffle, s, opportunity, cost, is, lower, than, the, benefits, of, the, chocolate, opportunity, costs, are, unavoidable, constraints, on, behavior, because, one, has, to, decide, what, s, best, and, give, up, the, next, best, alternative, microeconomics, is, also, known, as, price, theory, to, highlight, the, significance, of, prices, in, relation, to, buyer, and, sellers, as, these, agents, determine, prices, due, to, their, individual, actions, price, theory, is, a, field, of, economics, that, uses, the, supply, and, demand, framework, to, explain, and, predict, human, behavior, it, is, associated, with, the, chicago, school, of, economics, price, theory, studies, competitive, equilibrium, in, markets, to, yield, testable, hypotheses, that, can, be, rejected, price, theory, is, not, the, same, as, microeconomics, strategic, behavior, such, as, the, interactions, among, sellers, in, a, market, where, they, are, few, is, a, significant, part, of, microeconomics, but, is, not, emphasized, in, price, theory, price, theorists, focus, on, competition, believing, it, to, be, a, reasonable, description, of, most, markets, that, leaves, room, to, study, additional, aspects, of, tastes, and, technology, as, a, result, price, theory, tends, to, use, less, game, theory, than, microeconomics, does, price, theory, focuses, on, how, agents, respond, to, prices, but, its, framework, can, be, applied, to, a, wide, variety, of, socioeconomic, issues, that, might, not, seem, to, involve, prices, at, first, glance, price, theorists, have, influenced, several, other, fields, including, developing, public, choice, theory, and, law, and, economics, price, theory, has, been, applied, to, issues, previously, thought, of, as, outside, the, purview, of, economics, such, as, criminal, justice, marriage, and, addiction, supply, and, demand, is, an, economic, model, of, price, determination, in, a, perfectly, competitive, market, it, concludes, that, in, a, perfectly, competitive, market, with, no, externalities, per, unit, taxes, or, price, controls, the, unit, price, for, a, particular, good, is, the, price, at, which, the, quantity, demanded, by, consumers, equals, the, quantity, supplied, by, producers, this, price, results, in, a, stable, economic, equilibrium, prices, and, quantities, have, been, described, as, the, most, directly, observable, attributes, of, goods, produced, and, exchanged, in, a, market, economy, the, theory, of, supply, and, demand, is, an, organizing, principle, for, explaining, how, prices, coordinate, the, amounts, produced, and, consumed, in, microeconomics, it, applies, to, price, and, output, determination, for, a, market, with, perfect, competition, which, includes, the, condition, of, no, buyers, or, sellers, large, enough, to, have, price, setting, power, for, a, given, market, of, a, commodity, demand, is, the, relation, of, the, quantity, that, all, buyers, would, be, prepared, to, purchase, at, each, unit, price, of, the, good, demand, is, often, represented, by, a, table, or, a, graph, showing, price, and, quantity, demanded, as, in, the, figure, demand, theory, describes, individual, consumers, as, rationally, choosing, the, most, preferred, quantity, of, each, good, given, income, prices, tastes, etc, a, term, for, this, is, constrained, utility, maximization, with, income, and, wealth, as, the, constraints, on, demand, here, utility, refers, to, the, hypothesized, relation, of, each, individual, consumer, for, ranking, different, commodity, bundles, as, more, or, less, preferred, the, law, of, demand, states, that, in, general, price, and, quantity, demanded, in, a, given, market, are, inversely, related, that, is, the, higher, the, price, of, a, product, the, less, of, it, people, would, be, prepared, to, buy, other, things, unchanged, as, the, price, of, a, commodity, falls, consumers, move, toward, it, from, relatively, more, expensive, goods, the, substitution, effect, in, addition, purchasing, power, from, the, price, decline, increases, ability, to, buy, the, income, effect, other, factors, can, change, demand, for, example, an, increase, in, income, will, shift, the, demand, curve, for, a, normal, good, outward, relative, to, the, origin, as, in, the, figure, all, determinants, are, predominantly, taken, as, constant, factors, of, demand, and, supply, supply, is, the, relation, between, the, price, of, a, good, and, the, quantity, available, for, sale, at, that, price, it, may, be, represented, as, a, table, or, graph, relating, price, and, quantity, supplied, producers, for, example, business, firms, are, hypothesized, to, be, profit, maximizers, meaning, that, they, attempt, to, produce, and, supply, the, amount, of, goods, that, will, bring, them, the, highest, profit, supply, is, typically, represented, as, a, function, relating, price, and, quantity, if, other, factors, are, unchanged, that, is, the, higher, the, price, at, which, the, good, can, be, sold, the, more, of, it, producers, will, supply, as, in, the, figure, the, higher, price, makes, it, profitable, to, increase, production, just, as, on, the, demand, side, the, position, of, the, supply, can, shift, say, from, a, change, in, the, price, of, a, productive, input, or, a, technical, improvement, the, law, of, supply, states, that, in, general, a, rise, in, price, leads, to, an, expansion, in, supply, and, a, fall, in, price, leads, to, a, contraction, in, supply, here, as, well, the, determinants, of, supply, such, as, price, of, substitutes, cost, of, production, technology, applied, and, various, factors, of, inputs, of, production, are, all, taken, to, be, constant, for, a, specific, time, period, of, evaluation, of, supply, market, equilibrium, occurs, where, quantity, supplied, equals, quantity, demanded, the, intersection, of, the, supply, and, demand, curves, in, the, figure, above, at, a, price, below, equilibrium, there, is, a, shortage, of, quantity, supplied, compared, to, quantity, demanded, this, is, posited, to, bid, the, price, up, at, a, price, above, equilibrium, there, is, a, surplus, of, quantity, supplied, compared, to, quantity, demanded, this, pushes, the, price, down, the, model, of, supply, and, demand, predicts, that, for, given, supply, and, demand, curves, price, and, quantity, will, stabilize, at, the, price, that, makes, quantity, supplied, equal, to, quantity, demanded, similarly, demand, and, supply, theory, predicts, a, new, price, quantity, combination, from, a, shift, in, demand, as, to, the, figure, or, in, supply, for, a, given, quantity, of, a, consumer, good, the, point, on, the, demand, curve, indicates, the, value, or, marginal, utility, to, consumers, for, that, unit, it, measures, what, the, consumer, would, be, prepared, to, pay, for, that, unit, the, corresponding, point, on, the, supply, curve, measures, marginal, cost, the, increase, in, total, cost, to, the, supplier, for, the, corresponding, unit, of, the, good, the, price, in, equilibrium, is, determined, by, supply, and, demand, in, a, perfectly, competitive, market, supply, and, demand, equate, marginal, cost, and, marginal, utility, at, equilibrium, on, the, supply, side, of, the, market, some, factors, of, production, are, described, as, relatively, variable, in, the, short, run, which, affects, the, cost, of, changing, output, levels, their, usage, rates, can, be, changed, easily, such, as, electrical, power, raw, material, inputs, and, over, time, and, temp, work, other, inputs, are, relatively, fixed, such, as, plant, and, equipment, and, key, personnel, in, the, long, run, all, inputs, may, be, adjusted, by, management, these, distinctions, translate, to, differences, in, the, elasticity, responsiveness, of, the, supply, curve, in, the, short, and, long, runs, and, corresponding, differences, in, the, price, quantity, change, from, a, shift, on, the, supply, or, demand, side, of, the, market, marginalist, theory, such, as, above, describes, the, consumers, as, attempting, to, reach, most, preferred, positions, subject, to, income, and, wealth, constraints, while, producers, attempt, to, maximize, profits, subject, to, their, own, constraints, including, demand, for, goods, produced, technology, and, the, price, of, inputs, for, the, consumer, that, point, comes, where, marginal, utility, of, a, good, net, of, price, reaches, zero, leaving, no, net, gain, from, further, consumption, increases, analogously, the, producer, compares, marginal, revenue, identical, to, price, for, the, perfect, competitor, against, the, marginal, cost, of, a, good, with, marginal, profit, the, difference, at, the, point, where, marginal, profit, reaches, zero, further, increases, in, production, of, the, good, stop, for, movement, to, market, equilibrium, and, for, changes, in, equilibrium, price, and, quantity, also, change, at, the, margin, more, or, less, of, something, rather, than, necessarily, all, or, nothing, other, applications, of, demand, and, supply, include, the, distribution, of, income, among, the, factors, of, production, including, labor, and, capital, through, factor, markets, in, a, competitive, labor, market, for, example, the, quantity, of, labor, employed, and, the, price, of, labor, the, wage, rate, depends, on, the, demand, for, labor, from, employers, for, production, and, supply, of, labor, from, potential, workers, labor, economics, examines, the, interaction, of, workers, and, employers, through, such, markets, to, explain, patterns, and, changes, of, wages, and, other, labor, income, labor, mobility, and, un, employment, productivity, through, human, capital, and, related, public, policy, issues, demand, and, supply, analysis, is, used, to, explain, the, behavior, of, perfectly, competitive, markets, but, as, a, standard, of, comparison, it, can, be, extended, to, any, type, of, market, it, can, also, be, generalized, to, explain, variables, across, the, economy, for, example, total, output, estimated, as, real, gdp, and, the, general, price, level, as, studied, in, macroeconomics, tracing, the, qualitative, and, quantitative, effects, of, variables, that, change, supply, and, demand, whether, in, the, short, or, long, run, is, a, standard, exercise, in, applied, economics, economic, theory, may, also, specify, conditions, such, that, supply, and, demand, through, the, market, is, an, efficient, mechanism, for, allocating, resources, market, structure, refers, to, features, of, a, market, including, the, number, of, firms, in, the, market, the, distribution, of, market, shares, between, them, product, uniformity, across, firms, how, easy, it, is, for, firms, to, enter, and, exit, the, market, and, forms, of, competition, in, the, market, a, market, structure, can, have, several, types, of, interacting, market, systems, different, forms, of, markets, are, a, feature, of, capitalism, and, market, socialism, with, advocates, of, state, socialism, often, criticizing, markets, and, aiming, to, substitute, or, replace, markets, with, varying, degrees, of, government, directed, economic, planning, competition, acts, as, a, regulatory, mechanism, for, market, systems, with, government, providing, regulations, where, the, market, cannot, be, expected, to, regulate, itself, regulations, help, to, mitigate, negative, externalities, of, goods, and, services, when, the, private, equilibrium, of, the, market, does, not, match, the, social, equilibrium, one, example, of, this, is, with, regards, to, building, codes, which, if, absent, in, a, purely, competition, regulated, market, system, might, result, in, several, horrific, injuries, or, deaths, to, be, required, before, companies, would, begin, improving, structural, safety, as, consumers, may, at, first, not, be, as, concerned, or, aware, of, safety, issues, to, begin, putting, pressure, on, companies, to, provide, them, and, companies, would, be, motivated, not, to, provide, proper, safety, features, due, to, how, it, would, cut, into, their, profits, the, concept, of, market, type, is, different, from, the, concept, of, market, structure, nevertheless, there, are, a, variety, of, types, of, markets, the, different, market, structures, produce, cost, curves, based, on, the, type, of, structure, present, the, different, curves, are, developed, based, on, the, costs, of, production, specifically, the, graph, contains, marginal, cost, average, total, cost, average, variable, cost, average, fixed, cost, and, marginal, revenue, which, is, sometimes, equal, to, the, demand, average, revenue, and, price, in, a, price, taking, firm, perfect, competition, is, a, situation, in, which, numerous, small, firms, producing, identical, products, compete, against, each, other, in, a, given, industry, perfect, competition, leads, to, firms, producing, the, socially, optimal, output, level, at, the, minimum, possible, cost, per, unit, firms, in, perfect, competition, are, price, takers, they, do, not, have, enough, market, power, to, profitably, increase, the, price, of, their, goods, or, services, a, good, example, would, be, that, of, digital, marketplaces, such, as, ebay, on, which, many, different, sellers, sell, similar, products, to, many, different, buyers, consumers, in, a, perfect, competitive, market, have, perfect, knowledge, about, the, products, that, are, being, sold, in, this, market, imperfect, competition, is, a, type, of, market, structure, showing, some, but, not, all, features, of, competitive, markets, in, perfect, competition, market, power, is, not, achievable, due, to, a, high, level, of, producers, causing, high, levels, of, competition, therefore, prices, are, brought, down, to, a, marginal, cost, level, in, a, monopoly, market, power, is, achieved, by, one, firm, leading, to, prices, being, higher, than, the, marginal, cost, level, between, these, two, types, of, markets, are, firms, that, are, neither, perfectly, competitive, or, monopolistic, firms, such, as, pepsi, and, coke, and, sony, nintendo, and, microsoft, dominate, the, cola, and, video, game, industry, respectively, these, firms, are, in, imperfect, competition, monopolistic, competition, is, a, situation, in, which, many, firms, with, slightly, different, products, compete, production, costs, are, above, what, may, be, achieved, by, perfectly, competitive, firms, but, society, benefits, from, the, product, differentiation, examples, of, industries, with, market, structures, similar, to, monopolistic, competition, include, restaurants, cereal, clothing, shoes, and, service, industries, in, large, cities, a, monopoly, is, a, market, structure, in, which, a, market, or, industry, is, dominated, by, a, single, supplier, of, a, particular, good, or, service, because, monopolies, have, no, competition, they, tend, to, sell, goods, and, services, at, a, higher, price, and, produce, below, the, socially, optimal, output, level, however, not, all, monopolies, are, a, bad, thing, especially, in, industries, where, multiple, firms, would, result, in, more, costs, than, benefits, i, e, natural, monopolies, an, oligopoly, is, a, market, structure, in, which, a, market, or, industry, is, dominated, by, a, small, number, of, firms, oligopolists, oligopolies, can, create, the, incentive, for, firms, to, engage, in, collusion, and, form, cartels, that, reduce, competition, leading, to, higher, prices, for, consumers, and, less, overall, market, output, alternatively, oligopolies, can, be, fiercely, competitive, and, engage, in, flamboyant, advertising, campaigns, a, monopsony, is, a, market, where, there, is, only, one, buyer, and, many, sellers, a, bilateral, monopoly, is, a, market, consisting, of, both, a, monopoly, a, single, seller, and, a, monopsony, a, single, buyer, an, oligopsony, is, a, market, where, there, are, a, few, buyers, and, many, sellers, game, theory, is, a, major, method, used, in, mathematical, economics, and, business, for, modeling, competing, behaviors, of, interacting, agents, the, term, game, here, implies, the, study, of, any, strategic, interaction, between, people, applications, include, a, wide, array, of, economic, phenomena, and, approaches, such, as, auctions, bargaining, mergers, acquisitions, pricing, fair, division, duopolies, oligopolies, social, network, formation, agent, based, computational, economics, general, equilibrium, mechanism, design, and, voting, systems, and, across, such, broad, areas, as, experimental, economics, behavioral, economics, information, economics, industrial, organization, and, political, economy, information, economics, is, a, branch, of, microeconomic, theory, that, studies, how, information, and, information, systems, affect, an, economy, and, economic, decisions, information, has, special, characteristics, it, is, easy, to, create, but, hard, to, trust, it, is, easy, to, spread, but, hard, to, control, it, influences, many, decisions, these, special, characteristics, as, compared, with, other, types, of, goods, complicate, many, standard, economic, theories, the, economics, of, information, has, recently, become, of, great, interest, to, many, possibly, due, to, the, rise, of, information, based, companies, inside, the, technology, industry, from, a, game, theory, approach, the, usual, constraints, that, agents, have, complete, information, can, be, loosened, to, further, examine, the, consequences, of, having, incomplete, information, this, gives, rise, to, many, results, which, are, applicable, to, real, life, situations, for, example, if, one, does, loosen, this, assumption, then, it, is, possible, to, scrutinize, the, actions, of, agents, in, situations, of, uncertainty, it, is, also, possible, to, more, fully, understand, the, impacts, both, positive, and, negative, of, agents, seeking, out, or, acquiring, information, applied, microeconomics, includes, a, range, of, specialized, areas, of, study, many, of, which, draw, on, methods, from, other, fields
