the, roman, empire, even, after, the, fall, of, western, rome, latin, remained, the, common, language, of, international, communication, science, scholarship, and, academia, in, europe, until, well, into, the, early, 19th, century, when, regional, vernaculars, supplanted, it, in, common, academic, and, political, usage, including, its, own, descendants, the, romance, languages, latin, grammar,

language, from, the, 9th, century, to, the, renaissance, which, then, developed, a, classicizing, form, called, renaissance, latin, this, was, the, basis, for, neo, latin, which, evolved, during, the, early, modern, period, in, these, periods, latin, was, used, productively, and, generally, taught, to, be, written, and, spoken, at, least, until, the, late, seventeenth, century, when, spoken, skills, began, to, erode, it, then, became, increasingly, taught, only, to, be, read, latin, remains, the, official, language, of, the, holy, see, and, the, roman, rite, of, the, catholic, church, at,

read, rather, than, spoken, or, actively, used, latin, has, greatly, influenced, the, english, language, along, with, a, large, number, of, others, and, historically, contributed, many, words, to, the, english, lexicon, particularly, after, the, christianization, of, the, anglo, saxons, and, the, norman, conquest, latin, and, ancient, greek, roots, are, heavily, used, in, english, vocabulary, in, theology, the, sciences, medicine, and, law, a, number, of, phases, of, the, language, have, been, recognized, each, distinguished, by, subtle, differences, in, vocabulary, usage, spelling, and, syntax, there, are, no, hard, and, fast, rules, of, classification, different, scholars, emphasize, different, features, as, a, result, the, list, has, variants, as, well, as, alternative, names, in, addition, to, the, historical, phases, ecclesiastical, latin, refers, to, the, styles, used, by, the, writers, of, the, roman, catholic, church, from, late, antiquity, onward, as, well, as, by, protestant, scholars, the, earliest, known, form, of, latin, is, old, latin, also, called, archaic, or, early, latin, which, was, spoken, from, the, roman, kingdom, traditionally, founded, in, 753, bc, through, the, later, part, of, the, roman, republic, up, to, 75, bc, i, e, before, the, age, of, classical, latin, it, is, attested, both, in, inscriptions, and, in, some, of, the, earliest, extant, latin, literary, works, such, as, the, comedies, of, plautus, and, terence, the, latin, alphabet, was, devised, from, the, etruscan, alphabet, the, writing, later, changed, from, what, was, initially, either, a, right, to, left, or, a, boustrophedon, script, to, what, ultimately, became, a, strictly, left, to, right, script, during, the, late, republic, and, into, the, first, years, of, the, empire, from, about, 75, bc, to, ad, 200, a, new, classical, latin, arose, a, conscious, creation, of, the, orators, poets, historians, and, other, literate, men, who, wrote, the, great, works, of, classical, literature, which, were, taught, in, grammar, and, rhetoric, schools, today, s, instructional, grammars, trace, their, roots, to, such, schools, which, served, as, a, sort, of, informal, language, academy, dedicated, to, maintaining, and, perpetuating, educated, speech, philological, analysis, of, archaic, latin, works, such, as, those, of, plautus, which, contain, fragments, of, everyday, speech, gives, evidence, of, an, informal, register, of, the, language, vulgar, latin, termed, sermo, vulgi, the, speech, of, the, masses, by, cicero, some, linguists, particularly, in, the, nineteenth, century, believed, this, to, be, a, separate, language, existing, more, or, less, in, parallel, with, the, literary, or, educated, latin, but, this, is, now, widely, dismissed, the, term, vulgar, latin, remains, difficult, to, define, referring, both, to, informal, speech, at, any, time, within, the, history, of, latin, and, the, kind, of, informal, latin, that, had, begun, to, move, away, from, the, written, language, significantly, in, the, post, imperial, period, that, led, ultimately, to, the, romance, languages, during, the, classical, period, informal, language, was, rarely, written, so, philologists, have, been, left, with, only, individual, words, and, phrases, cited, by, classical, authors, inscriptions, such, as, curse, tablets, and, those, found, as, graffiti, in, the, late, latin, period, language, changes, reflecting, spoken, non, classical, norms, tend, to, be, found, in, greater, quantities, in, texts, as, it, was, free, to, develop, on, its, own, there, is, no, reason, to, suppose, that, the, speech, was, uniform, either, diachronically, or, geographically, on, the, contrary, romanised, european, populations, developed, their, own, dialects, of, the, language, which, eventually, led, to, the, differentiation, of, romance, languages, late, latin, is, a, kind, of, written, latin, used, in, the, 3rd, to, 6th, centuries, this, began, to, diverge, from, classical, forms, at, a, faster, pace, it, is, characterised, by, greater, use, of, prepositions, and, word, order, that, is, closer, to, modern, romance, languages, for, example, while, grammatically, retaining, more, or, less, the, same, formal, rules, as, classical, latin, ultimately, latin, diverged, into, a, distinct, written, form, where, the, commonly, spoken, form, was, perceived, as, a, separate, language, for, instance, early, french, or, italian, dialects, that, could, be, transcribed, differently, it, took, some, time, for, these, to, be, viewed, as, wholly, different, from, latin, however, after, the, western, roman, empire, fell, in, 476, and, germanic, kingdoms, took, its, place, the, germanic, people, adopted, latin, as, a, language, more, suitable, for, legal, and, other, more, formal, uses, while, the, written, form, of, latin, was, increasingly, standardized, into, a, fixed, form, the, spoken, forms, began, to, diverge, more, greatly, currently, the, five, most, widely, spoken, romance, languages, by, number, of, native, speakers, are, spanish, portuguese, french, italian, and, romanian, despite, dialectal, variation, which, is, found, in, any, widespread, language, the, languages, of, spain, france, portugal, and, italy, have, retained, a, remarkable, unity, in, phonological, forms, and, developments, bolstered, by, the, stabilising, influence, of, their, common, christian, roman, catholic, culture, it, was, not, until, the, muslim, conquest, of, spain, in, 711, cutting, off, communications, between, the, major, romance, regions, that, the, languages, began, to, diverge, seriously, the, spoken, latin, that, would, later, become, romanian, diverged, somewhat, more, from, the, other, varieties, as, it, was, largely, separated, from, the, unifying, influences, in, the, western, part, of, the, empire, spoken, latin, began, to, diverge, into, distinct, languages, by, the, 9th, century, at, the, latest, when, the, earliest, extant, romance, writings, begin, to, appear, they, were, throughout, the, period, confined, to, everyday, speech, as, medieval, latin, was, used, for, writing, for, many, italians, using, latin, though, there, was, no, complete, separation, between, italian, and, latin, even, into, the, beginning, of, the, renaissance, petrarch, for, example, saw, latin, as, a, literary, version, of, the, spoken, language, medieval, latin, is, the, written, latin, in, use, during, that, portion, of, the, post, classical, period, when, no, corresponding, latin, vernacular, existed, that, is, from, around, 700, to, 1500, ad, the, spoken, language, had, developed, into, the, various, romance, languages, however, in, the, educated, and, official, world, latin, continued, without, its, natural, spoken, base, moreover, this, latin, spread, into, lands, that, had, never, spoken, latin, such, as, the, germanic, and, slavic, nations, it, became, useful, for, international, communication, between, the, member, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, its, allies, without, the, institutions, of, the, roman, empire, that, had, supported, its, uniformity, medieval, latin, was, much, more, liberal, in, its, linguistic, cohesion, for, example, in, classical, latin, sum, and, eram, are, used, as, auxiliary, verbs, in, the, perfect, and, pluperfect, passive, which, are, compound, tenses, medieval, latin, might, use, fui, and, fueram, instead, furthermore, the, meanings, of, many, words, were, changed, and, new, words, were, introduced, often, under, influence, from, the, vernacular, identifiable, individual, styles, of, classically, incorrect, latin, prevail, renaissance, latin, 1300, to, 1500, and, the, classicised, latin, that, followed, through, to, the, present, are, often, grouped, together, as, neo, latin, or, new, latin, which, have, in, recent, decades, become, a, focus, of, renewed, study, given, their, importance, for, the, development, of, european, culture, religion, and, science, the, vast, majority, of, written, latin, belongs, to, this, period, but, its, full, extent, is, unknown, the, renaissance, reinforced, the, position, of, latin, as, a, spoken, and, written, language, by, the, scholarship, by, the, renaissance, humanists, petrarch, and, others, began, to, change, their, usage, of, latin, as, they, explored, the, texts, of, the, classical, latin, world, skills, of, textual, criticism, evolved, to, create, much, more, accurate, versions, of, extant, texts, through, the, fifteenth, and, sixteenth, centuries, and, some, important, texts, were, rediscovered, comprehensive, versions, of, authors, works, were, published, by, isaac, casaubon, joseph, scaliger, and, others, nevertheless, despite, the, careful, work, of, petrarch, politian, and, others, first, the, demand, for, manuscripts, and, then, the, rush, to, bring, works, into, print, led, to, the, circulation, of, inaccurate, copies, for, several, centuries, following, neo, latin, literature, was, extensive, and, prolific, but, less, well, known, or, understood, today, works, covered, poetry, prose, stories, and, early, novels, occasional, pieces, and, collections, of, letters, to, name, a, few, famous, and, well, regarded, writers, included, petrarch, erasmus, salutati, celtis, george, buchanan, and, thomas, more, non,

also, used, as, a, convenient, medium, for, translations, of, important, works, first, written, in, a, vernacular, such, as, those, of, descartes, latin, education, underwent, a, process, of, reform, to, classicise, written, and, spoken, latin, schooling, remained, largely, latin, medium, until, approximately, 1700, until, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, the, majority, of, books, and, almost, all, diplomatic, documents, were, written, in, latin, afterwards, most, diplomatic, documents, were, written, in, french, a, romance, language, and, later, native, or, other, languages, education, methods, gradually, shifted, towards, written, latin, and, eventually, concentrating, solely, on, reading, skills, the, decline, of, latin, education, took, several, centuries, and, proceeded, much, more, slowly, than, the, decline, in, written, latin, output, despite, having, no, native, speakers, latin, is, still, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, in, the, contemporary, world, the, largest,

high, school, students, to, pursue, the, study, of, latin, and, the, national, senior, classical, league, which, encourages, students, to, continue, their, study, of, the, classics, into, college, the, league, also, sponsors, the, national, latin, exam, classicist, mary, beard, wrote, in, the, times, literary, supplement, in, 2006, that, the, reason, for, learning, latin, is, because, of, what, was, written, in, it, latin, was, or, is, the, official, language, of, european, states, the, ancient, pronunciation, of, latin, has, been, reconstructed, among, the, data, used, for, reconstruction, are, explicit, statements, about, pronunciation, by, ancient, authors, misspellings, puns, ancient, etymologies, the, spelling, of, latin, loanwords, in, other, languages, and, the, historical, development, of, romance, languages, the, consonant, phonemes, of, classical, latin, are, as, follows, z, was, not, native, to, classical, latin, it, appeared, in, greek, loanwords, starting, around, the, first, century, bc, when, it, was, probably, pronounced, at, least, by, educated, speakers, initially, and, doubled, between, vowels, in, accordance, with, its, pronunciation, in, koine, greek, in, classical, latin, poetry, the, letter, z, between, vowels, always, counts, as, two, consonants, for, metrical, purposes, the, consonant, b, usually, sounds, as, however, when, t, or, s, follows, b, then, it, is, pronounced, as, in, or, in, latin, q, is, always, followed, by, the, vowel, u, together, they, make, a, sound, in, old, and, classical, latin, the, latin, alphabet, had, no, distinction, between, uppercase, and, lowercase, and, the, letters, j, u, w, did, not, exist, in, place, of, j, u, i, v, were, used, respectively, i, v, represented, both, vowels, and, consonants, most, of, the, letter, forms, were, similar, to, modern, uppercase, as, can, be, seen, in, the, inscription, from, the, colosseum, shown, at, the, top, of, the, article, the, spelling, systems, used, in, latin, dictionaries, and, modern, editions, of, latin, texts, however, normally, use, j, u, in, place, of, classical, era, i, v, some, systems, use, j, v, for, the, consonant, sounds, j, w, except, in, the, combinations, gu, su, qu, for, which, v, is, never, used, some, notes, concerning, the, mapping, of, latin, phonemes, to, english, graphemes, are, given, below, in, classical, latin, as, in, modern, italian, double, consonant, letters, were, pronounced, as, long, consonant, sounds, distinct, from, short, versions, of, the, same, consonants, thus, the, nn, in, classical, latin, annus, year, and, in, italian, anno, is, pronounced, as, a, doubled, nn, as, in, english, unnamed, in, english, distinctive, consonant, length, or, doubling, occurs, only, at, the, boundary, between, two, words, or, morphemes, as, in, that, example, in, classical, latin, u, did, not, exist, as, a, letter, distinct, from, v, the, written, form, v, was, used, to, represent, both, a, vowel, and, a, consonant, y, was, adopted, to, represent, upsilon, in, loanwords, from, greek, but, it, was, pronounced, like, u, and, i, by, some, speakers, it, was, also, used, in, native, latin, words, by, confusion, with, greek, words, of, similar, meaning, such, as, sylva, and, classical, latin, distinguished, between, long, and, short, vowels, then, long, vowels, except, for, i, were, frequently, marked, using, the, apex, which, was, sometimes, similar, to, an, acute, accent, v, long, i, was, written, using, a, taller, version, of, i, called, i, longa, long, i, in, modern, texts, long, vowels, are, often, indicated, by, a, macron, and, short, vowels, are, usually, unmarked, except, when, it, is, necessary, to, distinguish, between, words, when, they, are, marked, with, a, breve, however, they, would, also, signify, a, long, vowel, by, writing, the, vowel, larger, than, other, letters, in, a, word, or, by, repeating, the, vowel, twice, in, a, row, the, acute, accent, when, it, is, used, in, modern, latin, texts, indicates, stress, as, in, spanish, rather, than, length, although, called, long, vowels, their, exact, quality, in, classical, latin, is, different, from, short, vowels, the, difference, is, described, in, the, table, below, this, difference, in, quality, is, posited, by, w, sidney, allen, in, his, book, vox, latina, however, andrea, calabrese, has, disputed, this, assertion, based, in, part, upon, the, observation, that, in, sardinian, and, some, lucanian, dialects, each, long, and, short, vowel, pair, merged, as, opposed, to, in, italo, western, languages, in, which, short, i, and, u, merged, with, long, e, and, o, c, f, latin, siccus, italian, secco, and, sardinian, siccu, a, vowel, letter, followed, by, m, at, the, end, of, a, word, or, a, vowel, letter, followed, by, n, before, s, or, f, represented, a, short, nasal, vowel, as, in, monstrum, classical, latin, had, several, diphthongs, the, two, most, common, were, ae, au, the, former, pronounced, like, the, i, in, mine, and, the, latter, like, the, ow, in, power, oe, was, fairly, rare, and, ui, eu, ei, were, very, rare, at, least, in, native, latin, words, there, has, also, been, debate, over, whether, ui, is, truly, a, diphthong, in, classical, latin, due, to, its, rarity, absence, in, works, of, roman, grammarians, and, the, roots, of, classical, latin, words, i, e, hui, ce, to, huic, quoi, to, cui, etc, not, matching, or, being, similar, to, the, pronunciation, of, classical, words, if, ui, were, to, be, considered, a, diphthong, the, sequences, sometimes, did, not, represent, diphthongs, ae, and, oe, also, represented, a, sequence, of, two, vowels, in, different, syllables, in, a, nus, bronze, and, co, pit, began, and, au, ui, eu, ei, ou, represented, sequences, of, two, vowels, or, of, a, vowel, and, one, of, the, semivowels, j, w, in, cav, beware, cuius, whose, monu, i, warned, solv, i, released, d, l, v, i, destroyed, eius, his, and, novus, new, old, latin, had, more, diphthongs, but, most, of, them, changed, into, long, vowels, in, classical, latin, the, old, latin, diphthong, ai, and, the, sequence, became, classical, ae, old, latin, oi, and, ou, changed, to, classical, except, in, a, few, words, whose, oi, became, classical, oe, these, two, developments, sometimes, occurred, in, different, words, from, the, same, root, for, instance, classical, poena, punishment, and, p, n, re, to, punish, early, old, latin, ei, usually, monophthongized, to, a, later, old, latin, to, classical, by, the, late, roman, empire, ae, oe, had, merged, with, e, during, the, classical, period, this, sound, change, was, present, in, some, rural, dialects, but, deliberately, avoided, by, well, educated, speakers, syllables, in, latin, are, signified, by, the, presence, of, diphthongs, and, vowels, the, number, of, syllables, is, the, same, as, the, number, of, vowel, sounds, further, if, a, consonant, separates, two, vowels, it, will, go, into, the, syllable, of, the, second, vowel, when, there, are, two, consonants, between, vowels, the, last, consonant, will, go, with, the, second, vowel, an, exception, occurs, when, a, phonetic, stop, and, liquid, come, together, in, this, situation, they, are, thought, to, be, a, single, consonant, and, as, such, they, will, go, into, the, syllable, of, the, second, vowel, syllables, in, latin, are, considered, either, long, or, short, less, often, called, heavy, and, light, respectively, within, a, word, a, syllable, may, either, be, long, by, nature, or, long, by, position, a, syllable, is, long, by, nature, if, it, has, a, diphthong, or, a, long, vowel, on, the, other, hand, a, syllable, is, long, by, position, if, the, vowel, is, followed, by, more, than, one, consonant, there, are, two, rules, that, define, which, syllable, is, stressed, in, classical, latin, latin, was, written, in, the, latin, alphabet, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, v, x, derived, from, the, etruscan, alphabet, which, was, in, turn, drawn, from, the, greek, alphabet, and, ultimately, the, phoenician, alphabet, this, alphabet, has, continued, to, be, used, over, the, centuries, as, the, script, for, the, romance, celtic, germanic, baltic, finnic, and, many, slavic, languages, polish, slovak, slovene, croatian, bosnian, serbian, and, czech, and, it, has, been, adopted, by, many, languages, around, the, world, including, vietnamese, the, austronesian, languages, many, turkic, languages, and, most, languages, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, americas, and, oceania, making, it, by, far, the, world, s, single, most, widely, used, writing, system, the, number, of, letters, in, the, latin, alphabet, has, varied, when, it, was, first, derived, from, the, etruscan, alphabet, it, contained, only, 21, letters, later, g, was, added, to, represent, which, had, previously, been, spelled, c, and, z, ceased, to, be, included, in, the, alphabet, as, the, language, then, had, no, voiced, alveolar, fricative, the, letters, k, y, and, z, were, later, added, to, represent, greek, letters, kappa, upsilon, and, zeta, respectively, in, greek, loanwords, w, was, created, in, the, 11th, century, from, vv, in, some, areas, and, uu, in, others, it, represented, w, in, germanic, languages, not, latin, which, still, uses, v, for, the, purpose, j, was, distinguished, from, the, original, i, only, during, the, late, middle, ages, as, was, the, letter, u, from, v, although, some, latin, dictionaries, use, j, it, is, rarely, used, for, latin, text, as, it, was, not, used, in, classical, times, but, many, other, languages, use, it, classical, latin, did, not, contain, sentence, punctuation, letter, case, or, interword, spacing, but, apices, were, sometimes, used, to, distinguish, length, in, vowels, and, the, interpunct, was, used, at, times, to, separate, words, the, first, line, of, catullus, 3, mourn, o, venuses, and, cupids, was, originally, written, as, it, would, be, rendered, in, a, modern, edition, as, the, roman, cursive, script, is, commonly, found, on, the, many, wax, tablets, excavated, at, sites, such, as, forts, an, especially, extensive, set, having, been, discovered, at, vindolanda, on, hadrian, s, wall, in, britain, most, notable, is, the, fact, that, while, most, of, the, vindolanda, tablets, show, spaces, between, words, spaces, were, avoided, in, monumental, inscriptions, from, that, era, occasionally, latin, has, been, written, in, other, scripts, latin, is, a, synthetic, fusional, language, in, the, terminology, of, linguistic, typology, words, involve, an, objective, semantic, element, and, markers, usually, suffixes, specifying, the, grammatical, use, of, the, word, expressing, gender, number, and, case, in, adjectives, nouns, and, pronouns, declension, and, verbs, to, denote, person, number, tense, voice, mood, and, aspect, conjugation, some, words, are, uninflected, and, undergo, neither, process, such, as, adverbs, prepositions, and, interjections, latin, inflection, can, result, in, words, with, much, ambiguity, for, example, am, bit, he, she, it, will, love, is, formed, from, am, a, future, tense, morpheme, bi, and, a, third, person, singular, morpheme, t, the, last, of, which, t, does, not, express, masculine, feminine, or, neuter, gender, a, major, task, in, understanding, latin, phrases, and, clauses, is, to, clarify, such, ambiguities, by, an, analysis, of, context, a, regular, latin, noun, belongs, to, one, of, five, main, declensions, a, group, of, nouns, with, similar, inflected, forms, the, declensions, are, identified, by, the, genitive, singular, form, of, the, noun, there, are, seven, latin, noun, cases, which, also, apply, to, adjectives, and, pronouns, and, mark, a, noun, s, syntactic, role, in, the, sentence, by, means, of, inflections, thus, word, order, is, not, as, important, in, latin, as, it, is, in, english, which, is, less, inflected, the, general, structure, and, word, order, of, a, latin, sentence, can, therefore, vary, the, cases, are, as, follows, latin, lacks, both, definite, and, indefinite, articles, so, puer, currit, can, mean, either, the, boy, is, running, or, a, boy, is, running, there, are, two, types, of, regular, latin, adjectives, first, and, second, declension, and, third, declension, they, are, so, called, because, their, forms, are, similar, or, identical, to, first, and, second, declension, and, third, declension, nouns, respectively, latin, adjectives, also, have, comparative, and, superlative, forms, there, are, also, a, number, of, latin, participles, latin, numbers, are, sometimes, declined, as, adjectives, see, numbers, below, first, and, second, declension, adjectives, are, declined, like, first, declension, nouns, for, the, feminine, forms, and, like, second, declension, nouns, for, the, masculine, and, neuter, forms, for, example, for, mortuus, mortua, mortuum, dead, mortua, is, declined, like, a, regular, first, declension, noun, such, as, puella, girl, mortuus, is, declined, like, a, regular, second, declension, masculine, noun, such, as, dominus, lord, master, and, mortuum, is, declined, like, a, regular, second, declension, neuter, noun, such, as, auxilium, help, third, declension, adjectives, are, mostly, declined, like, normal, third, declension, nouns, with, a, few, exceptions, in, the, plural, nominative, neuter, for, example, the, ending, is, ia, omnia, all, everything, and, for, third, declension, nouns, the, plural, nominative, neuter, ending, is, a, or, ia, capita, heads, animalia, animals, they, can, have, one, two, or, three, forms, for, the, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, nominative, singular, latin, participles, like, english, participles, are, formed, from, a, verb, there, are, a, few, main, types, of, participles, present, active, participles, perfect, passive, participles, future, active, participles, and, future, passive, participles, latin, sometimes, uses, prepositions, depending, on, the, type, of, prepositional, phrase, being, used, most, prepositions, are, followed, by, a, noun, in, either, the, accusative, or, ablative, case, apud, puerum, with, the, boy, with, puerum, being, the, accusative, form, of, puer, boy, and, sine, puero, without, the, boy, puero, being, the, ablative, form, of, puer, a, few, adpositions, however, govern, a, noun, in, the, genitive, such, as, gratia, and, tenus, a, regular, verb, in, latin, belongs, to, one, of, four, main, conjugations, a, conjugation, is, a, class, of, verbs, with, similar, inflected, forms, the, conjugations, are, identified, by, the, last, letter, of, the, verb, s, present, stem, the, present, stem, can, be, found, by, omitting, the, re, r, in, deponent, verbs, ending, from, the, present, infinitive, form, the, infinitive, of, the, first, conjugation, ends, in, re, or, ri, active, and, passive, respectively, am, re, to, love, hort, r, to, exhort, of, the, second, conjugation, by, re, or, r, mon, re, to, warn, ver, r, to, fear, of, the, third, conjugation, by, ere, d, cere, to, lead, t, to, use, of, the, fourth, by, re, r, aud, re, to, hear, exper, r, to, attempt, the, stem, categories, descend, from, indo, european, and, can, therefore, be, compared, to, similar, conjugations, in, other, indo, european, languages, irregular, verbs, are, verbs, that, do, not, follow, the, regular, conjugations, in, the, formation, of, the, inflected, form, irregular, verbs, in, latin, are, esse, to, be, velle, to, want, ferre, to, carry, edere, to, eat, dare, to, give, ire, to, go, posse, to, be, able, fieri, to, happen, and, their, compounds, there, are, six, simple, tenses, in, latin, present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, and, future, perfect, three, moods, indicative, imperative, and, subjunctive, in, addition, to, the, infinitive, participle, gerund, gerundive, and, supine, three, persons, first, second, and, third, two, numbers, singular, and, plural, two, voices, active, and, passive, and, two, aspects, perfective, and, imperfective, verbs, are, described, by, four, principal, parts, the, six, simple, tenses, of, latin, are, divided, into, two, systems, the, present, system, which, is, made, up, of, the, present, imperfect, and, future, forms, and, the, perfect, system, which, is, made, up, of, the, perfect, pluperfect, and, future, perfect, forms, each, simple, tense, has, a, set, of, endings, corresponding, to, the, person, number, and, voice, of, the, subject, subject, nominative, pronouns, are, generally, omitted, for, the, first, i, we, and, second, you, persons, except, for, emphasis, the, table, below, displays, the, common, inflected, endings, for, the, indicative, mood, in, the, active, voice, in, all, six, tenses, for, the, future, tense, the, first, listed, endings, are, for, the, first, and, second, conjugations, and, the, second, listed, endings, are, for, the, third, and, fourth, conjugations, some, latin, verbs, are, deponent, causing, their, forms, to, be, in, the, passive, voice, but, retain, an, active, meaning, hortor, hort, r, hort, tus, sum, to, urge, as, latin, is, an, italic, language, most, of, its, vocabulary, is, likewise, italic, ultimately, from, the, ancestral, proto, indo, european, language, however, because, of, close, cultural, interaction, the, romans, not, only, adapted, the, etruscan, alphabet, to, form, the, latin, alphabet, but, also, borrowed, some, etruscan, words, into, their, language, including, persona, mask, and, histrio, actor, latin, also, included, vocabulary, borrowed, from, oscan, another, italic, language, after, the, fall, of, tarentum, 272, bc, the, romans, began, hellenising, or, adopting, features, of, greek, culture, including, the, borrowing, of, greek, words, such, as, camera, vaulted, roof, sumbolum, symbol, and, balineum, bath, this, hellenisation, led, to, the, addition, of, y, and, z, to, the, alphabet, to, represent, greek, sounds, subsequently, the, romans, transplanted, greek, art, medicine, science, and, philosophy, to, italy, paying, almost, any, price, to, entice, greek, skilled, and, educated, persons, to, rome, and, sending, their, youth, to, be, educated, in, greece, thus, many, latin, scientific, and, philosophical, words, were, greek, loanwords, or, had, their, meanings, expanded, by, association, with, greek, words, as, ars, craft, and, art, because, of, the, roman, empire, s, expansion, and, subsequent, trade, with, outlying, european, tribes, the, romans, borrowed, some, northern, and, central, european, words, such, as, beber, beaver, of, germanic, origin, and, bracae, breeches, of, celtic, origin, the, specific, dialects, of, latin, across, latin, speaking, regions, of, the, former, roman, empire, after, its, fall, were, influenced, by, languages, specific, to, the, regions, the, dialects, of, latin, evolved, into, different, romance, languages, during, and, after, the, adoption, of, christianity, into, roman, society, christian, vocabulary, became, a, part, of, the, language, either, from, greek, or, hebrew, borrowings, or, as, latin, neologisms, continuing, into, the, middle, ages, latin, incorporated, many, more, words, from, surrounding, languages, including, old, english, and, other, germanic, languages, over, the, ages, latin, speaking, populations, produced, new, adjectives, nouns, and, verbs, by, affixing, or, compounding, meaningful, segments, for, example, the, compound, adjective, omnipotens, all, powerful, was, produced, from, the, adjectives, omnis, all, and, potens, powerful, by, dropping, the, final, s, of, omnis, and, concatenating, often, the, concatenation, changed, the, part, of, speech, and, nouns, were, produced, from, verb, segments, or, verbs, from, nouns, and, adjectives, in, ancient, times, numbers, in, latin, were, written, only, with, letters, today, the, numbers, can, be, written, with, the, arabic, numbers, as, well, as, with, roman, numerals, the, numbers, 1, 2, and, 3, and, every, whole, hundred, from, 200, to, 900, are, declined, as, nouns, and, adjectives, with, some, differences, the, numbers, from, 4, to, 100, do, not, change, their, endings, as, in, modern, descendants, such, as, spanish, the, gender, for, naming, a, number, in, isolation, is, masculine, so, that, 1, 2, 3, is, counted, as, nus, duo, tr, s, commentarii, de, bello, gallico, also, called, de, bello, gallico, the, gallic, war, written, by, gaius, julius, caesar, begins, with, the, following, passage, gallia,
