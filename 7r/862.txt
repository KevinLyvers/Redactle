philip, stanhope, chesterfield, s, bastard, son, throughout, the, correspondence, chesterfield, endeavoured, to, decouple, the, matter, of, social, manners, from, conventional, morality, with,

elegant, literary, style, of, writing, epitomised, the, emotional, restraint, characteristic, of, polite, social, intercourse, in, 18th, century, society, i, would, heartily, wish, that, you, may, often, be, seen, to, smile, but, never, heard, to, laugh, while, you, live, frequent, and, loud, laughter, is, the, characteristic, of, folly, and, ill, manners, it, is, the, manner, in, which, the, mob, express, their, silly, joy, at, silly, things, and, they, call, it, being, merry, in, my, mind, there, is, nothing, so, illiberal, and, so, ill, bred, as, audible, laughter, i, am, neither, of, a, melancholy, nor, a, cynical, disposition, and, am, as, willing, and, as, apt, to, be, pleased, as, anybody, but, i, am, sure, that, since, i, have, had, the, full, use, of, my, reason, nobody, has, ever, heard, me, laugh, in, the, 19th, century, victorian, era, 1837, 1901, etiquette, developed, into, a, complicated, system, of, codified, behaviours, which, governed, the, range, of, manners, in, society, from, the, proper, language, style, and, method, for, writing, letters, to, correctly, using, cutlery, at, table, and, to, the, minute, regulation, of, social, relations, and, personal, interactions, between, men, and, women, and, among, the, social, classes, in, a, society, manners, are, described, as, either, good, manners, or, as, bad, manners, to, indicate, whether, a, person, s, behaviour, is, acceptable, to, the, cultural, group, as, such, manners, enable, ultrasociality, and, are, integral, to, the, functioning, of, the, social, norms, and, conventions, that, are, informally, enforced, through, self, regulation, the, perspectives, of, sociology, indicate, that, manners, are, a, means, for, people, to, display, their, social, status, and, a, means, of, demarcating, observing, and, maintaining, the, boundaries, of, social, identity, and, of, social, class, in, the, civilizing, process, 1939, sociologist, norbert, elias, said, that, manners, arose, as, a, product, of, group, living, and, persist, as, a, way, of, maintaining, social, order, manners, proliferated, during, the, renaissance, in, response, to, the, development, of, the, absolute, state, the, progression, from, small, group, living, to, large, group, living, characterised, by, the, centralized, power, of, the, state, the, rituals, and, manners, associated, with, the, royal, court, of, england, during, that, period, were, closely, bound, to, a, person, s, social, status, manners, demonstrate, a, person, s, position, within, a, social, network, and, a, person, s, manners, are, a, means, of, negotiation, from, that, social, position, from, the, perspective, of, public, health, in, the, healthy, citizen, 1996, alana, r, petersen, and, deborah, lupton, said, that, manners, assisted, the, diminishment, of, the, social, boundaries, that, existed, between, the, public, sphere, and, the, private, sphere, of, a, person, s, life, and, so, gave, rise, to, a, highly, reflective, self, a, self, who, monitors, his, or, her, behavior, with, due, regard, for, others, with, whom, he, or, she, interacts, socially, and, that, the, public, behavior, of, individuals, came, to, signify, their, social, standing, a, means, of, presenting, the, self, and, of, evaluating, others, and, thus, the, control, of, the, outward, self, was, vital, sociologist, pierre, bourdieu, applied, the, concept, of, habitus, to, define, the, societal, functions, of, manners, the, habitus, is, the, set, of, mental, attitudes, personal, habits, and, skills, that, a, person, possesses, his, or, her, dispositions, of, character, that, are, neither, self, determined, nor, pre, determined, by, the, external, environment, but, which, are, produced, and, reproduced, by, social, interactions, and, are, inculcated, through, experience, and, explicit, teaching, yet, tend, to, function, at, the, subconscious, level, manners, are, likely, to, be, a, central, part, of, the, dispositions, that, guide, a, person, s, ability, to, decide, upon, socially, compliant, behaviours, in, purity, and, danger, an, analysis, of, concepts, of, pollution, and, taboo, 2003, the, anthropologist, mary, douglas, said, that, manners, social, behaviors, and, group, rituals, enable, the, local, cosmology, to, remain, ordered, and, free, from, those, things, that, may, pollute, or, defile, the, integrity, of, the, culture, ideas, of, pollution, defilement, and, disgust, are, attached, to, the, margins, of, socially, acceptable, behaviour, in, order, to, curtail, unacceptable, behaviour, and, so, maintain, the, assumptions, by, which, experience, is, controlled, within, the, culture, in, studying, the, expression, of, emotion, by, humans, and, animals, naturalist, charles, darwin, noted, the, universality, of, facial, expressions, of, disgust, and, shame, among, infants, and, blind, people, and, concluded, that, the, emotional, responses, of, shame, and, disgust, are, innate, behaviours, public, health, specialist, valerie, curtis, said, that, the, development, of, facial, responses, was, concomitant, with, the, development, of, manners, which, are, behaviours, with, an, evolutionary, role, in, preventing, the, transmission, of, diseases, thus, people, who, practise, personal, hygiene, and, politeness, will, most, benefit, from, membership, in, their, social, group, and, so, stand, the, best, chance, of, biological, survival, by, way, of, opportunities, for, reproduction, from, the, study, of, the, evolutionary, bases, of, prejudice, social, psychologists, catherine, cottrell, and, steven, neuberg, said, that, human, behavioural, responses, to, otherness, might, enable, the, preservation, of, manners, and, social, norms, the, feeling, of, foreignness, which, people, experience, in, their, first, social, interaction, with, someone, from, another, culture, might, partly, serve, an, evolutionary, function, group, living, surrounds, one, with, individuals, able, to, physically, harm, fellow, group, members, to, spread, contagious, disease, or, to, free, ride, on, their, efforts, therefore, a, commitment, to, sociality, is, a, risk, if, threats, such, as, these, are, left, unchecked, the, costs, of, sociality, will, quickly, exceed, its, benefits, thus, to, maximize, the, returns, on, group, living, individual, group, members, should, be, attuned, to, others, features, or, behaviors, therefore, people, who, possess, the, social, traits, common, to, the, cultural, group, are, to, be, trusted, and, people, without, the, common, social, traits, are, to, be, distrusted, as, others, and, thus, treated, with, suspicion, or, excluded, from, the, group, that, pressure, of, social, exclusivity, born, from, the, shift, towards, communal, living, excluded, uncooperative, people, and, persons, with, poor, personal, hygiene, the, threat, of, social, exclusion, led, people, to, avoid, personal, behaviours, that, might, embarrass, the, group, or, that, might, provoke, revulsion, among, the, group, to, demonstrate, the, transmission, of, social, conformity, anthropologists, joseph, henrich, and, robert, boyd, developed, a, behavioural, model, in, which, manners, are, a, means, of, mitigating, social, differences, curbing, undesirable, personal, behaviours, and, fostering, co, operation, within, the, social, group, natural, selection, favoured, the, acquisition, of, genetically, transmitted, mechanisms, for, learning, thereby, increasing, a, person, s, chances, for, acquiring, locally, adaptive, behaviours, humans, possess, a, reliably, developing, neural, encoding, that, compels, them, both, to, punish, individuals, who, violate, group, norms, common, beliefs, or, practices, and, punish, individuals, who, do, not, punish, norm, violators, social, manners, are, in, three, categories, i, manners, of, hygiene, ii, manners, of, courtesy, and, iii, manners, of, cultural, norm, each, category, accounts, for, an, aspect, of, the, functional, role, that, manners, play, in, a, society, the, categories, of, manners, are, based, upon, the, social, outcome, of, behaviour, rather, than, upon, the, personal, motivation, of, the, behaviour, as, a, means, of, social, management, the, rules, of, etiquette, encompass, most, aspects, of, human, social, interaction, thus, a, rule, of, etiquette, reflects, an, underlying, ethical, code, and, a, person, s, fashion, and, social, status, the, book, of, the, courtier, 1528, by, baldassare, castiglione, identified, the, manners, and,
