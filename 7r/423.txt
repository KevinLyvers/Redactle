institutions, while, the, pashtun, tribes, spoke, pashto, as, their, native, tongue, king, amanullah, khan, began, promoting, pashto, during, his, reign, 1926, 1929, as, a, marker, of, ethnic,

1930s, a, movement, began, to, take, hold, to, promote, pashto, as, a, language, of, government, administration, and, art, with, the, establishment, of, a, pashto, society, pashto, anjuman, in, 1931, and, the, inauguration, of, the, kabul, university, in, 1932, as, well, as, the, formation, of, the, pashto, academy, pashto, tolana, in, 1937, muhammad, na, im, khan, the, minister, of, education, between, 1938, and, 1946, inaugurated, the, formal, policy, of, promoting, pashto, as, afghanistan, s, national, language, leading, to, the, commission, and, publication, of, pashto, textbooks, the, pashto, tolana, was, later, incorporated, into, the, academy, of, sciences, afghanistan, in, line, with, soviet, model, following, the, saur, revolution, in, 1978, although, officially, supporting, the, use, of, pashto, the, afghan, elite, regarded, persian, as, a, sophisticated, language, and, a, symbol, of, cultured, upbringing, king, zahir, shah, reigning, 1933, 1973, thus, followed, suit, after, his, father, nadir, khan, had, decreed, in, 1933, that, officials, were, to, study, and, utilize, both, persian, and, pashto, in, 1936, a, royal, decree, of, zahir, shah, formally, granted, pashto, the, status, of, an, official, language, with, full, rights, to, use, in, all, aspects, of, government, and, education, despite, the, fact, that, the, ethnically, pashtun, royal, family, and, bureaucrats, mostly, spoke, persian, thus, pashto, became, a, national, language, a, symbol, for, pashtun, nationalism, the, constitutional, assembly, reaffirmed, the, status, of, pashto, as, an, official, language, in, 1964, when, afghan, persian, was, officially, renamed, to, dari, the, lyrics, of, the, national, anthem, of, afghanistan, are, in, pashto, in, british, india, prior, to, the, creation, of, pakistan, by, the, british, government, the, 1920s, saw, the, blossoming, of, pashto, language, in, the, then, nwfp, abdul, ghafar, khan, in, 1921, established, the, anjuman, e, islah, al, afaghina, society, for, the, reformation, of, afghans, to, promote, pashto, as, an, extension, of, pashtun, culture, around, 80, 000, people, attended, the, society, s, annual, meeting, in, 1927, in, 1955, pashtun, intellectuals, including, abdul, qadir, formed, the, pashto, academy, peshawar, on, the, model, of, pashto, tolana, formed, in, afghanistan, in, 1974, the, department, of, pashto, was, established, in, the, university, of, balochistan, for, the, promotion, of, pashto, in, pakistan, pashto, is, the, first, language, around, of, 15, of, its, population, per, the, 1998, census, however, urdu, and, english, are, the, two, official, languages, of, pakistan, pashto, has, no, official, status, at, the, federal, level, on, a, provincial, level, pashto, is, the, regional, language, of, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, and, north, balochistan, yet, the, primary, medium, of, education, in, government, schools, in, pakistan, is, urdu, the, lack, of, importance, given, to, pashto, and, its, neglect, has, caused, growing, resentment, amongst, pashtuns, it, is, noted, that, pashto, is, taught, poorly, in, schools, in, pakistan, moreover, in, government, schools, material, is, not, provided, for, in, the, pashto, dialect, of, that, locality, pashto, being, a, dialectically, rich, language, further, researchers, have, observed, that, pashtun, students, are, unable, to, fully, comprehend, educational, material, in, urdu, professor, tariq, rahman, states, the, government, of, pakistan, faced, with, irredentist, claims, from, afghanistan, on, its, territory, also, discouraged, the, pashto, movement, and, eventually, allowed, its, use, in, peripheral, domains, only, after, the, pakhtun, elite, had, been, co, opted, by, the, ruling, elite, thus, even, though, there, is, still, an, active, desire, among, some, pakhtun, activists, to, use, pashto, in, the, domains, of, power, it, is, more, of, a, symbol, of, pakhtun, identity, than, one, of, nationalism, robert, nicols, states, in, the, end, national, language, policy, especially, in, the, field, of, education, in, the, nwfp, had, constructed, a, type, of, three, tiered, language, hierarchy, pashto, lagged, far, behind, urdu, and, english, in, prestige, or, development, in, almost, every, domain, of, political, or, economic, power, although, pashto, used, as, a, medium, of, instruction, in, schools, for, pashtun, students, results, in, better, understanding, and, comprehension, for, students, when, compared, to, using, urdu, still, the, government, of, pakistan, has, only, introduced, pashto, at, the, primary, levels, in, state, run, schools, taimur, khan, remarks, the, dominant, urdu, language, squeezes, and, denies, any, space, for, pashto, language, in, the, official, and, formal, capacity, in, this, contact, zone, pashto, language, exists, but, in, a, subordinate, and, unofficial, capacity, some, linguists, have, argued, that, pashto, is, descended, from, avestan, or, a, variety, very, similar, to, it, while, others, have, attempted, to, place, it, closer, to, bactrian, however, neither, position, is, universally, agreed, upon, what, scholars, do, agree, on, is, the, fact, that, pashto, is, an, eastern, iranian, language, sharing, characteristics, with, eastern, middle, iranian, languages, such, as, bactrian, khwarezmian, and, sogdian, compare, with, other, eastern, iranian, languages, and, old, avestan, z, t, win, m, z, d, w, n, n, az, b, t, dzunim, strabo, who, lived, between, 64, bc, and, 24, ce, explains, that, the, tribes, inhabiting, the, lands, west, of, the, indus, river, were, part, of, ariana, this, was, around, the, time, when, the, area, inhabited, by, the, pashtuns, was, governed, by, the, greco, bactrian, kingdom, from, the, 3rd, century, ce, onward, they, are, mostly, referred, to, by, the, name, afghan, abgan, abdul, hai, habibi, believed, that, the, earliest, modern, pashto, work, dates, back, to, amir, kror, suri, of, the, early, ghurid, period, in, the, 8th, century, and, they, use, the, writings, found, in, pata, khazana, p, a, xaz, n, is, a, pashto, manuscript, claimed, to, be, written, by, mohammad, hotak, under, the, patronage, of, the, pashtun, emperor, hussain, hotak, in, kandahar, containing, an, anthology, of, pashto, poets, however, its, authenticity, is, disputed, by, scholars, such, as, david, neil, mackenzie, and, lucia, serena, loi, nile, green, comments, in, this, regard, in, 1944, habibi, claimed, to, have, discovered, an, eighteenth, century, manuscript, anthology, containing, much, older, biographies, and, verses, of, pashto, poets, that, stretched, back, as, far, as, the, eighth, century, it, was, an, extraordinary, claim, implying, as, it, did, that, the, history, of, pashto, literature, reached, back, further, in, time, than, persian, thus, supplanting, the, hold, of, persian, over, the, medieval, afghan, past, although, it, was, later, convincingly, discredited, through, formal, linguistic, analysis, habibi, s, publication, of, the, text, under, the, title, pata, khazana, hidden, treasure, would, in, afghanistan, at, least, establish, his, reputation, as, a, promoter, of, the, wealth, and, antiquity, of, afghanistan, s, pashto, culture, from, the, 16th, century, pashto, poetry, become, very, popular, among, the, pashtuns, some, of, those, who, wrote, in, pashto, are, bayazid, pir, roshan, a, major, inventor, of, the, pashto, alphabet, khushal, khan, khattak, rahman, baba, nazo, tokhi, and, ahmad, shah, durrani, founder, of, the, modern, state, of, afghanistan, or, the, durrani, empire, the, pashtun, literary, tradition, grew, in, the, backdrop, to, weakening, pashtun, power, following, mughal, rule, khushal, khan, khattak, used, pashto, poetry, to, rally, for, pashtun, unity, and, pir, bayazid, as, an, expedient, means, to, spread, his, message, to, the, pashtun, masses, for, instance, khushal, khattak, laments, in, the, afghans, pashtuns, are, far, superior, to, the, mughals, at, the, sword, were, but, the, afghans, in, intellect, a, little, discreet, if, the, different, tribes, would, but, support, each, other, kings, would, have, to, bow, down, in, prostration, before, them, pashto, is, a, subject, object, verb, sov, language, with, split, ergativity, in, pashto, this, means, that, the, verb, agrees, with, the, subject, in, transitive, and, intransitive, sentences, in, non, past, non, completed, clauses, but, when, a, completed, action, is, reported, in, any, of, the, past, tenses, the, verb, agrees, with, the, subject, if, it, is, intransitive, but, with, the, object, if, it, is, transitive, verbs, are, inflected, for, present, simple, past, past, progressive, present, perfect, and, past, perfect, tenses, there, is, also, an, inflection, for, the, subjunctive, mood, nouns, and, adjectives, are, inflected, for, two, genders, masculine, and, feminine, two, numbers, singular, and, plural, and, four, cases, direct, oblique, ablative, and, vocative, the, possessor, precedes, the, possessed, in, the, genitive, construction, and, adjectives, come, before, the, nouns, they, modify, unlike, most, other, indo, iranian, languages, pashto, uses, all, three, types, of, adpositions, prepositions, postpositions, and, circumpositions, the, retroflex, rhotic, or, lateral, tends, to, be, a, lateral, flap, at, the, beginning, of, a, syllable, or, other, prosodic, unit, and, a, regular, flap, or, approximant, elsewhere, in, pashto, most, of, the, native, elements, of, the, lexicon, are, related, to, other, eastern, iranian, languages, as, noted, by, josef, elfenbein, loanwords, have, been, traced, in, pashto, as, far, back, as, the, third, century, b, c, and, include, words, from, greek, and, probably, old, persian, for, instance, georg, morgenstierne, notes, the, pashto, word, me, n, i, e, a, hand, mill, as, being, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, word, m, khan, i, e, a, device, post, 7th, century, borrowings, came, primarily, from, persian, and, hindi, urdu, with, arabic, words, being, borrowed, through, persian, but, sometimes, directly, modern, speech, borrows, words, from, english, french, and, german, however, a, remarkably, large, number, of, words, are, unique, to, pashto, here, is, an, exemplary, list, of, pure, pashto, and, borrowings, na, i, jah, n, duny, tod, t, wda, garm, a, ty, arurah, h, la, umid, d, p, a, b, ra, bol, la, qasidah, due, to, the, incursion, of, persian, and, persianized, arabic, in, modern, speech, linguistic, purism, of, pashto, is, advocated, to, prevent, its, own, vocabulary, from, dying, out, there, is, a, lot, of, old, vocabulary, that, has, been, replaced, by, borrowings, e, g, pl, z, throne, with, takht, from, persian, or, the, word, yag, nag, meaning, uniqueness, used, by, pir, roshan, bayazid, such, classical, vocabulary, is, being, reintroduced, to, modern, pashto, some, words, also, survive, in, dialects, like, the, bride, room, example, from, khayr, al, bay, n, pashto, employs, the, pashto, alphabet, a, modified, form, of, the, perso, arabic, alphabet, or, arabic, script, in, the, 16th, century, bayazid, pir, roshan, introduced, 13, new, letters, to, the, pashto, alphabet, the, alphabet, was, further, modified, over, the, years, the, pashto, alphabet, consists, of, 45, to, 46, letters, and, 4, diacritic, marks, latin, pashto, is, also, used, in, latin, transliteration, stress, is, represented, by, the, following, markers, over, vowels, and, the, following, table, read, from, left, to, right, gives, the, letters, isolated, forms, along, with, possible, latin, equivalents, and, typical, ipa, values, pashto, dialects, are, divided, into, two, categories, the, soft, southern, grouping, of, pa, t, and, the, hard, northern, grouping, of, pax, t, pakhtu, each, group, is, further, divided, into, a, number, of, dialects, the, southern, dialect, of, tareeno, is, the, most, distinctive, pashto, dialect, 1, southern, variety, 2, northern, variety, 3, tareeno, dialect, literary, pashto, is, the, artificial, variety, of, pashto, that, is, used, at, times, as, literary, register, of, pashto, it, is, said, to, be, based, on, the, north, western, dialect, spoken, in, the, central, ghilji, region, literary, pashto, s, vocabulary, also, derives, from, other, dialects, there, is, no, actual, pashto, that, can, be, identified, as, standard, pashto, as, colye, remarks, standard, pashto, is, actually, fairly, complex, with, multiple, varieties, or, forms, native, speakers, or, researchers, often, refer, to, standard, pashto, without, specifying, which, variety, of, standard, pashto, they, mean, people, sometimes, refer, to, standard, pashto, when, they, mean, the, most, respected, or, favorite, pashto, variety, among, a, majority, of, pashtun, speakers, as, david, mackenzie, notes, there, is, no, real, need, to, develop, a, standard, pashto, the, morphological, differences, between, the, most, extreme, north, eastern, and, south, western, dialects, are, comparatively, few, and, unimportant, the, criteria, of, dialect, differentiation, in, pashto, are, primarily, phonological, with, the, use, of, an, alphabet, which, disguises, these, phonological, differences, the, language, has, therefore, been, a, literary, vehicle, widely, understood, for, at, least, four, centuries, this, literary, language, has, long, been, referred, to, in, the, west, as, common, or, standard, pashto, without, seemingly, any, real, attempt, to, define, it, pashto, speakers, have, long, had, a, tradition, of, oral, literature, including, proverbs, stories, and, poems, written, pashto, literature, saw, a, rise, in, development, in, the, 17th, century, mostly, due, to, poets, like, khushal, khan, khattak, 1613, 1689, who, along, with, rahman, baba, 1650, 1715, is, widely, regarded, as, among, the, greatest, pashto, poets, from, the, time, of, ahmad, shah, durrani, 1722, 1772, pashto, has, been, the, language, of, the, court, the, first, pashto, teaching, text, was, written, during, the, period, of, ahmad, shah, durrani, by, pir, mohammad, kakar, with, the, title, of,
