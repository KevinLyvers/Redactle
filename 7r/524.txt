smuggling, is, the, illegal, transportation, of, objects, substances, information, or, people, such, as, out, of, a, house, or, buildings, into, a, prison, or, across, an, international, border, in, violation, of, applicable, laws, or, other, regulations, more, broadly, social, scientists, define, smuggling, as, the, purposeful, movement, across, a, border, in, contravention, to, the, relevant, legal, frameworks, there, are, various, motivations, to, smuggle, these, include, the, participation, in, illegal, trade, such, as, in, the, drug, trade, illegal, weapons, trade, prostitution, human, trafficking, kidnapping, heists, chop, shops, illegal, immigration, or, illegal, emigration, tax, evasion, import, restrictions, export, restrictions, providing, contraband, to, prison, inmates, or, the, theft, of, the, items, being, smuggled, smuggling, is, a, common, theme, in, literature, from, bizet, s, opera, carmen, to, the, james, bond, spy, books, and, later, films, diamonds, are, forever, and, goldfinger, the, verb, smuggle, from, low, german, smuggeln, or, dutch, smokkelen, to, transport, goods, illegally, apparently, a, frequentative, formation, of, a, word, meaning, to, sneak, most, likely, entered, the, english, language, during, the, 1600s, 1700s, smuggling, has, a, long, and, controversial, history, probably, dating, back, to, the, first, time, at, which, duties, were, imposed, in, any, form, or, any, attempt, was, made, to, prohibit, a, form, of, traffic, smuggling, is, often, associated, with, efforts, by, authorities, to, prevent, the, importation, of, certain, contraband, items, or, non, taxed, goods, however, there, has, also, been, smuggling, based, on, illegally, exporting, goods, in, england, smuggling, first, became, a, recognised, problem, in, the, 13th, century, following, the, creation, of, a, national, customs, collection, system, by, edward, i, in, 1275, medieval, smuggling, tended, to, focus, on, the, export, of, highly, taxed, export, goods, notably, wool, and, hides, merchants, also, however, sometimes, smuggled, other, goods, to, circumvent, prohibitions, or, embargoes, on, particular, trades, grain, for, instance, was, usually, prohibited, from, export, unless, prices, were, low, because, of, fears, that, grain, exports, would, raise, the, price, of, food, in, england, and, thus, cause, food, shortages, and, civil, unrest, following, the, loss, of, gascony, to, the, french, in, 1453, imports, of, wine, were, also, sometimes, embargoed, during, wars, to, try, to, deprive, the, french, of, the, revenues, that, could, be, earned, from, their, main, export, most, studies, of, historical, smuggling, have, been, based, on, official, sources, such, as, court, records, or, the, letters, of, revenue, officers, a, senior, academic, of, the, university, of, bristol, states, that, they, only, detail, the, activities, of, those, dumb, enough, to, get, caught, this, has, led, him, and, others, such, as, prof, h, v, bowen, of, the, university, of, swansea, to, use, commercial, records, to, reconstruct, smuggling, businesses, jones, study, focuses, on, smuggling, in, bristol, in, the, mid, 16th, century, arguing, that, the, illicit, export, of, goods, like, grain, and, leather, represented, a, significant, part, of, the, city, s, business, with, many, members, of, the, civic, elite, engaging, in, it, whether, by, disguised, hidden, transport, or, mis, description, of, goods, grain, smuggling, by, members, of, the, civic, elite, often, working, closely, with, corrupt, customs, officers, has, also, been, shown, to, have, been, prevalent, in, east, anglia, during, the, later, 16th, century, in, england, wool, was, smuggled, to, the, continent, in, the, 17th, century, under, the, pressure, of, high, excise, taxes, in, 1724, daniel, defoe, wrote, of, lymington, hampshire, on, the, south, coast, of, england, i, do, not, find, they, have, any, foreign, commerce, except, it, be, what, we, call, smuggling, and, roguing, which, i, may, say, is, the, reigning, commerce, of, all, this, part, of, the, english, coast, from, the, mouth, of, the, thames, to, the, land, s, end, in, cornwall, the, high, rates, of, duty, levied, on, tea, and, also, wine, and, spirits, and, other, luxury, goods, coming, in, from, mainland, europe, at, this, time, made, the, clandestine, import, of, such, goods, and, the, evasion, of, the, duty, a, highly, profitable, venture, for, impoverished, fishermen, and, seafarers, in, certain, parts, of, the, country, such, as, the, romney, marsh, east, kent, cornwall, and, east, cleveland, the, smuggling, industry, was, for, many, communities, more, economically, significant, than, legal, activities, such, as, farming, and, fishing, the, principal, reason, for, the, high, duty, was, the, need, for, the, government, to, finance, a, number, of, extremely, expensive, wars, with, france, and, the, united, states, before, the, era, of, drug, smuggling, and, human, trafficking, smuggling, had, acquired, a, kind, of, nostalgic, romanticism, in, the, vein, of, robert, louis, stevenson, s, kidnapped, few, places, on, the, british, coast, did, not, claim, to, be, the, haunts, of, wreckers, or, mooncussers, the, thievery, was, boasted, about, and, romanticized, until, it, seemed, a, kind, of, heroism, it, did, not, have, any, taint, of, criminality, and, the, whole, of, the, south, coast, had, pockets, vying, with, one, another, over, whose, smugglers, were, the, darkest, or, most, daring, the, smugglers, inn, was, one, of, the, commonest, names, for, a, bar, on, the, coast, in, north, america, smuggling, in, colonial, times, was, a, reaction, to, the, heavy, taxes, and, regulations, imposed, by, mercantilist, trade, policies, after, american, independence, in, 1783, smuggling, developed, at, the, edges, of, the, united, states, at, places, like, passamaquoddy, bay, st, mary, s, in, georgia, lake, champlain, and, louisiana, during, thomas, jefferson, s, embargo, of, 1807, 1809, these, same, places, became, the, primary, places, where, goods, were, smuggled, out, of, the, nation, in, defiance, of, the, law, like, britain, a, gradual, liberalization, of, trade, laws, as, part, of, the, free, trade, movement, meant, less, smuggling, in, 1907, president, theodore, roosevelt, tried, to, cut, down, on, smuggling, by, establishing, the, roosevelt, reservation, along, the, united, states, mexico, border, smuggling, revived, in, the, 1920s, during, prohibition, and, drug, smuggling, became, a, major, problem, after, 1970, in, the, 1990s, when, economic, sanctions, were, imposed, on, serbia, a, large, percent, of, the, population, lived, off, smuggling, petrol, and, consumer, goods, from, neighboring, countries, the, state, unofficially, allowed, this, to, continue, or, otherwise, the, entire, economy, would, have, collapsed, in, modern, times, as, many, first, world, countries, have, struggled, to, contain, a, rising, influx, of, immigrants, the, smuggling, of, people, across, national, borders, has, become, a, lucrative, extra, legal, activity, as, well, as, the, extremely, dark, side, people, trafficking, especially, of, women, who, may, be, enslaved, typically, as, prostitutes, much, smuggling, occurs, when, enterprising, merchants, attempt, to, supply, demand, for, a, good, or, service, that, is, illegal, or, heavily, taxed, as, a, result, illegal, drug, trafficking, and, the, smuggling, of, weapons, illegal, arms, trade, as, well, as, the, historical, staples, of, smuggling, alcohol, rum, running, and, tobacco, are, widespread, as, the, smuggler, faces, significant, risk, of, civil, and, criminal, penalties, if, caught, with, contraband, smugglers, are, able, to, impose, a, significant, price, premium, on, smuggled, goods, the, profits, involved, in, smuggling, goods, appear, to, be, extensive, the, iron, law, of, prohibition, dictates, that, greater, enforcement, results, in, more, potent, alcohol, and, drugs, being, smuggled, profits, also, derive, from, avoiding, taxes, or, levies, on, imported, goods, for, example, a, smuggler, might, purchase, a, large, quantity, of, cigarettes, in, a, place, with, low, taxes, and, smuggle, them, into, a, place, with, higher, taxes, where, they, can, be, sold, at, a, far, higher, margin, than, would, otherwise, be, possible, it, has, been, reported, that, smuggling, one, truckload, of, cigarettes, within, the, united, states, can, lead, to, a, profit, of, us, 2, million, in, october, 2023, spanish, police, arrested, 11, individuals, involved, in, smuggling, migrants, hidden, in, trucks, at, algeciras, sea, border, connected, to, a, network, providing, forged, documents, in, the, same, month, they, dismantled, another, criminal, organization, focused, on, supplying, fake, documents, to, migrants, in, spain, primarily, in, the, agricultural, sector, with, regard, to, people, smuggling, a, distinction, can, be, made, between, people, smuggling, as, a, service, to, those, wanting, to, illegally, migrate, and, the, involuntary, trafficking, of, people, an, estimated, 90, of, people, who, illegally, crossed, the, border, between, mexico, and, the, united, states, are, believed, to, have, paid, a, smuggler, to, lead, them, across, people, smuggling, can, be, used, to, rescue, a, person, from, oppressive, circumstances, for, example, when, the, southern, united, states, allowed, slavery, many, slaves, moved, north, via, the, underground, railroad, similarly, during, the, holocaust, jewish, people, were, smuggled, out, of, germany, by, people, such, as, algoth, niska, trafficking, of, human, beings, sometimes, called, human, trafficking, or, in, the, case, of, sexual, services, sex, trafficking, is, not, the, same, as, people, smuggling, a, smuggler, will, facilitate, illegal, entry, into, a, country, for, a, fee, and, on, arrival, at, their, destination, the, smuggled, person, is, free, the, trafficking, victim, is, coerced, in, some, way, victims, do, not, agree, to, be, trafficked, they, are, tricked, lured, by, false, promises, or, forced, into, it, traffickers, use, coercive, tactics, including, deception, fraud, intimidation, isolation, physical, threats, and, use, of, force, debt, bondage, or, even, force, feeding, drugs, to, control, their, victims, while, the, majority, of, victims, are, women, and, sometimes, children, other, victims, include, men, women, and, children, forced, or, conned, into, manual, or, cheap, labor, due, to, the, illegal, nature, of, trafficking, the, exact, extent, is, unknown, a, u, s, government, report, published, in, 2003, estimates, that, 800, 000, 900, 000, people, worldwide, are, trafficked, across, borders, each, year, this, figure, does, not, include, those, who, are, trafficked, internally, according, to, a, study, by, alternatives, to, combat, child, labour, through, education, and, sustainable, services, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, region, access, mena, 30, of, school, children, living, in, border, villages, of, yemen, had, been, smuggled, into, saudi, arabia, child, trafficking, is, commonly, referenced, as, transporting, smuggled, children, were, in, danger, of, being, sexually, abused, or, even, killed, poverty, is, one, of, the, reasons, behind, child, trafficking, and, some, children, are, smuggled, with, their, parents, consent, via, a, transporter, as, many, as, 50, of, those, smuggled, are, children, in, the, philippines, between, 60, 000, and, 100, 000, children, are, trafficked, to, work, in, the, sex, industry, each, year, hundreds, of, thousands, of, migrants, are, moved, illegally, by, highly, organized, international, smuggling, and, trafficking, groups, often, in, dangerous, or, inhumane, conditions, this, phenomenon, has, been, growing, in, recent, years, as, people, of, low, income, countries, are, aspiring, to, enter, developed, countries, in, search, of, jobs, migrant, smuggling, and, human, trafficking, are, two, separate, offences, and, differ, in, a, few, central, respects, while, smuggling, refers, to, facilitating, the, illegal, entry, of, a, person, into, a, state, trafficking, includes, an, element, of, exploitation, the, trafficker, retains, control, over, the, migrant, through, force, fraud, or, coercion, typically, in, the, sex, industry, through, forced, labour, or, through, other, practices, similar, to, slavery, trafficking, violates, the, idea, of, basic, human, rights, the, overwhelming, majority, of, those, trafficked, are, women, and, children, these, victims, are, commodities, in, a, multibillion, dollar, global, industry, criminal, organizations, are, choosing, to, traffic, human, beings, because, unlike, other, commodities, people, can, be, used, repeatedly, and, because, trafficking, requires, little, in, terms, of, capital, investment, smuggling, is, also, reaping, huge, financial, dividends, to, criminal, groups, who, charge, migrants, massive, fees, for, their, services, intelligence, reports, have, noted, that, drug, traffickers, and, other, criminal, organizations, are, switching, to, human, cargo, to, obtain, greater, profit, with, less, risk, it, is, acknowledged, that, the, smuggling, of, people, is, a, growing, global, phenomenon, it, is, a, transnational, crime, currently, economic, instability, appears, to, be, the, main, reason, for, illegal, migration, movement, throughout, the, world, nevertheless, many, of, the, willing, migrants, undertake, the, hazardous, travel, to, their, destination, country, with, criminal, syndicates, specialized, in, people, smuggling, these, syndicates, arrange, everything, for, the, migrants, but, at, a, high, price, very, often, the, traveling, conditions, are, inhumane, the, migrants, are, overcrowded, in, trucks, or, boats, and, fatal, accidents, occur, frequently, after, their, arrival, in, the, destination, country, their, illegal, status, puts, them, at, the, mercy, of, their, smugglers, which, often, force, the, migrants, to, work, for, years, in, the, illegal, labor, market, to, pay, off, the, debts, incurred, as, a, result, of, their, transportation, wildlife, smuggling, results, from, the, demand, for, exotic, species, and, the, lucrative, nature, of, the, trade, the, cites, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, regulates, the, movement, of, endangered, wildlife, across, political, borders, research, on, smuggling, as, economic, phenomenon, is, scant, jagdish, bhagwati, and, bent, hansen, first, forwarded, a, theory, of, smuggling, in, which, they, saw, smuggling, essentially, as, an, import, substituting, economic, activity, their, main, consideration, however, was, the, welfare, implications, of, smuggling, against, common, belief, that, the, private, sector, is, more, efficient, than, the, public, sector, they, showed, that, smuggling, might, not, enhance, social, welfare, though, it, may, divert, resources, from, governments, to, the, private, sector, in, contrast, faizul, latif, chowdhury, in, 1999, suggested, a, production, substituting, model, of, smuggling, in, which, price, disparity, due, to, cost, of, supply, is, critically, important, as, an, incentive, for, smuggling, this, price, disparity, is, caused, by, domestic, consumption, taxes, and, import, duties, drawing, attention, to, the, case, of, cigarettes, chowdhury, suggested, that, in, bangladesh, smuggling, of, cigarettes, reduced, the, level, of, domestic, production, domestic, production, of, cigarettes, is, subject, to, value, added, tax, vat, and, other, consumption, tax, reduction, of, domestic, taxes, enables, the, local, producer, to, supply, at, a, lower, cost, and, bring, down, the, price, disparity, that, encourages, smuggling, however, chowdhury, suggested, that, there, is, a, limit, beyond, which, reducing, domestic, taxes, on, production, cannot, confer, a, competitive, advantage, versus, smuggled, cigarettes, therefore, government, needs, to, upscale, its, anti, smuggling, drive, so, that, seizures, taking, possession, of, person, or, property, by, legal, process, can, add, to, the, cost, of, smuggling, and, thus, render, smuggling, uncompetitive, notably, chowdhury, modeled, the, relationship, of, the, smuggler, to, the, local, producer, as, one, of, antagonistic, duopoly, on, the, other, hand, research, by, tat, chee, tsui, in, 2016, suggests, that, even, if, increasing, cigarette, duty, may, encourage, smuggling, total, cigarette, consumption, still, declines, because, the, price, of, illicit, goods, as, substitutes, of, taxed, cigarettes, also, increases, because, of, higher, tax, rate, one, economic, view, sees, smuggling, as, monopoly, busting, as, a, challenge, to, state, sponsored, restrictions, or, taxes, on, trade, in, smuggling, concealment, can, involve, concealing, the, smuggled, goods, on, a, person, s, clothing, luggage, or, inside, a, body, cavity, some, smugglers, hide, the, whole, transportation, vehicle, or, ship, used, to, bring, the, items, into, an, area, avoiding, border, checks, such, as, by, small, ships, private, airplanes, through, overland, smuggling, routes, smuggling, tunnels, and, even, small, submersibles, this, also, applies, for, illegally, passing, a, border, oneself, for, illegal, immigration, or, illegal, emigration, in, many, parts, of, the, world, particularly, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, smuggling, vessel, of, choice, is, the, go, fast, boat, submitting, to, border, checks, with, the, goods, or, people, hidden, in, a, vehicle, or, between, other, merchandise, or, the, goods, hidden, in, luggage, in, or, under, clothes, inside, the, body, see, body, cavity, search, balloon, swallower, and, mule, etc, many, smugglers, fly, on, regularly, scheduled, airlines, a, large, number, of, suspected, smugglers, are, caught, each, year, by, customs, worldwide, goods, and, people, are, also, smuggled, across, seas, hidden, in, containers, and, overland, hidden, in, cars, trucks, and, trains, a, related, topic, is, illegally, passing, a, border, oneself, as, a, stowaway, the, high, level, of, duty, levied, on, alcohol, and, tobacco, in, britain, has, led, to, large, scale, smuggling, from, france, to, the, uk, through, the, channel, tunnel, the, combination, of, acknowledged, corruption, at, the, border, and, high, import, tariffs, led, smugglers, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, to, fly, electronic, equipment, such, as, stereos, and, televisions, in, cargo, planes, from, one, country, to, clandestine, landing, strips, in, another, thereby, circumventing, encounters, at, the, frontier, between, countries, for, illegally, passing, a, border, oneself, another, method, is, with, a, false, passport, completely, fake, or, illegally, changed, or, the, passport, of, a, lookalike, at, border, checkpoints, especially, for, shipping, cargo, border, agents, must, inspect, cargo, for, smuggled, and, illegal, goods, however, because, of, what, is, called, gridlock, a, maximum, of, 5, inspections, per, cargo, holds, worldwide, since, it, can, take, a, proper, and, complete, inspection, four, to, six, hours, major, global, trade, routes, such, as, singapore, offer, great, opportunity, for, smugglers, and, traders, alike, as, the, leading, cape, town, customs, official, argues, if, a, shipping, port, stops, and, inspects, every, ship, it, would, cause, a, total, shipping, grid, lock, which, is, trade, gridlock, which, is, also, economic, gridlock, by, under, declaring, and, misrepresenting, even, the, most, surprising, goods, is, common, practice, when, smuggling, what, popular, culture, does, not, communicate, is, that, illegal, drugs, and, arms, are, not, the, bane, of, customs, officers, and, the, ultimate, threat, to, their, economy, in, reality, the, most, commonly, smuggled, items, are, everyday, items, one, believes, to, be, common, and, thus, causes, higher, losses, in, tax, revenue, an, anonymous, shipping, agent, said, that, smuggling, becomes, second, nature, to, businessmen, taking, finished, products, and, misrepresenting, them, to, offer, the, cheapest, possible, rate, what, the, majority, of, people, do, not, realize, is, that, the, media, and, popular, culture, focus, on, criminal, organizations, as, primary, smugglers, but, in, reality, legitimate, businesses, are, the, biggest, offenders, by, incorporating, their, label, on, merchandise, or, products, it, leaves, bias, towards, their, goods, as, the, popular, media, portrays, them, as, reliable, smuggling, however, is, produced, through, the, very, culture, of, the, shipping, industry, and, is, affected, by, institutionalized, tariffs, and, taxes, around, the, world, the, existence, of, the, multi, consignment, contraband, mcc, smuggling, method, smuggling, two, or, more, different, types, of, contraband, such, as, drugs, and, illegal, immigrants, or, drugs, and, guns, at, the, same, time, was, verified, following, the, completion, of, a, study, that, found, 16, documented, cases, of, smugglers, transporting, more, than, one, type, of, contraband, in, the, same, shipment, mcc, shipments, were, frequently, associated, with, phase, ii, and, phase, iii, smuggling, organizations, in, addition, to, human, couriers, smugglers, have, been, known, to, transport, illicit, goods, with, the, use, of, trained, animals, one, advantage, to, smugglers, using, animals, is, that, unlike, human, couriers, who, might, turn, state, s, evidence, if, caught, an, animal, courier, if, caught, with, any, contraband, on, them, would, be, unable, to, provide, any, verbal, information, to, the, authorities, one, way, that, smugglers, have, used, animals, to, transport, contraband, at, times, is, through, the, use, of, dogs, often, smugglers, have, been, known, to, strap, drugs, onto, the, backs, of, canine, and, then, use, such, dogs, as, pack, animals, to, transport, the, contraband, across, further, distances, or, across, borders, another, way, smugglers, have, used, to, transport, contraband, on, multiple, occasions, is, cats, usually, the, cats, are, used, to, sneak, drugs, into, prisons, where, prison, gangs, can, then, sell, the, drugs, to, other, inmates, often, a, smuggler, from, the, outside, will, attach, small, amounts, of, drugs, to, a, cat, and, then, the, cat, will, either, be, lured, inside, the, prison, by, inmates, with, cat, treats, or, the, cat, might, be, trained, to, enter, the, prison, in, addition, to, drugs, cats, have, also, been, used, to, smuggle, other, kinds, of, contraband, into, prison, such, as, cellphones, tools, batteries, and, phone, chargers, the, reason, why, cats, can, make, good, drug, couriers, is, due, to, the, fact, that, felines, are, naturally, stealthy, animals, and, because, the, prison, guards, are, often, less, likely, to, suspect, that, contraband, might, be, on, a, cat, additionally, smugglers, have, also, used, homing, pigeons, to, transport, contraband, by, air, at, times, carrier, pigeons, have, been, used, to, smuggle, drugs, into, prisons, and, across, borders, additionally, homing, pigeons, have, also, been, used, to, transport, cellphones, and, sim, cards, into, prisons, the, reason, why, pigeons, have, been, useful, for, smugglers, is, that, they, can, fly, for, long, distances, and, because, the, birds, are, usually, unlikely, to, arouse, much, suspicion, from, authorities, due, to, the, fact, that, pigeons, are, such, widespread, and, commonly, witnessed, birds, in, both, rural, and, urban, areas, smugglers, have, also, been, known, to, transport, contraband, with, the, use, of, livestock, one, such, example, is, the, use, of, horses, donkeys, mules, and, ponies, the, traffickers, often, strap, the, illicit, goods, to, the, packhorses, pack, saddle, so, that, the, animal, can, carry, more, loads, of, contraband, further, and, across, more, rugged, terrain, then, a, human, courier, in, addition, to, packhorses, smugglers, have, also, been, known, to, transport, contraband, with, the, use, of, horse, drawn, vehicles, additionally, there, are, also, livestock, that, smugglers, have, used, as, living, body, couriers, in, such, instances, the, animals, are, either, made, to, swallow, the, drugs, or, the, drugs, are, surgically, implanted, inside, the, animals, before, they, are, herded, to, another, destination, at, a, later, date, when, the, animals, are, slaughtered, for, their, meat, the, drugs, are, then, removed, and, given, to, associates, one, such, example, is, the, use, of, cattle, cattle, have, been, used, as, body, couriers, to, transport, contraband, in, multiple, ways, often, by, inserting, the, drugs, into, the, cattle, to, be, removed, at, a, later, time, after, slaughter, another, animal, that, traffickers, have, used, as, body, couriers, are, goats, which, they, remove, drugs, from, after, slaughter, additionally, another, animal, that, has, been, used, by, smugglers, to, transport, contraband, are, sheep, often, times, the, traffickers, either, attach, the, drugs, to, the, sheep, s, wool, or, they, insert, the, drugs, inside, the, sheep, to, be, removed, at, a, later, date, after, slaughter, what, type, of, livestock, or, pack, animals, do, organized, criminals, use, to, carry, contraband, often, depends, on, availability, and, region, for, example, in, parts, of, south, america, traffickers, have, used, llamas, as, pack, animals, to, transport, drugs, across, rugged, terrain, or, across, borders, in, certain, parts, of, asia, elephants, have, been, used, as, pack, animals, to, carry, large, amounts, of, drugs, across, wilderness, areas, or, across, borders, in, middle, eastern, countries, smugglers, have, also, been, known, to, use, camels, as, pack, animals, to, transport, drugs, across, further, distances, or, across, borders, in, popular, perception, smuggling, is, synonymous, with, illegal, trade, even, social, scientists, have, misconstrued, smuggling, as, illegal, trade, while, the, two, have, indeed, identical, objectives, namely, the, evasion, of, taxes, and, the, importation, of, contraband, items, their, demand, and, cost, functions, are, altogether, different, requiring, different, analytical, framework, as, a, result, illegal, trade, through, customs, stations, is, differently, considered, and, smuggling, is, defined, as, international, trade, through, unauthorized, route, a, seaport, airport, or, land, port, which, has, not, been, authorized, by, the, government, for, importation, and, exportation, is, an, unauthorized, route, the, legal, definition, of, these, occurs, in, the, customs, act, of, the, country, notably, some, definitions, define, any, undeclared, trafficking, of, currency, and, precious, metal, as, smuggling, smuggling, is, a, cognizable, offense, in, which, both, the, smuggled, goods, and, the, goods, are, punishable
