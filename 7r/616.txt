starred, in, their, own, episodes, according, to, matt, groening, the, show, adopted, the, concept, of, a, large, supporting, cast, from, the, comedy, show, sctv, despite, the, depiction, of, yearly, milestones, such, as, holidays, or, birthdays, passing, the, characters, never, age, the, series, uses, a, floating, timeline, in, which, episodes, generally, take, place, in, the, year, the, episode, is, produced, flashbacks, and, flashforwards, do, occasionally, depict, the, characters, at, other, points, in, their, lives, with, the, timeline, of, these, depictions, also, generally, floating, relative, to, the, year, the, episode, is, produced, for, example, the, 1991, episodes, the, way, we, was, and, i, married, marge, depict, homer, and, marge, as, high, schoolers, in, the, 1970s, who,

episode, do, pizza, bots, dream, of, electric, guitars, portrays, homer, as, an, adolescent, in, the, same, period, the, 1995, episode, lisa, s, wedding, takes, place, during, lisa, s, college, years, in, the, then, future, year, of, 2010, the, same, year, the, show, began, airing, its, 22nd, season, in, which, lisa, was, still, 8, regarding, the, contradictory, flashbacks, selman, stated, that, they, all, kind, of, happened, in, their, imaginary, world, the, show, follows, a, loose, and, inconsistent, continuity, for, example, krusty, the, clown, may, be, able, to, read, in, one, episode, but, not, in, another, however, it, is, consistently, portrayed, that, he, is, jewish, that, his, father, was, a, rabbi, and, that, his, career, began, in, the, 1960s, the, latter, point, introduces, another, snag, in, the, floating, timeline, historical, periods, that, are, a, core, part, of, a, character, s, backstory, remain, so, even, when, their, age, makes, it, unlikely, or, impossible, such, as, grampa, simpson, and, principal, skinner, s, respective, service, in, world, war, ii, and, vietnam, the, only, episodes, not, part, of, the, series, main, canon, are, the, treehouse, of, horror, episodes, which, often, feature, the, deaths, of, main, characters, characters, who, die, in, regular, episodes, such, as, maude, flanders, mona, simpson, and, edna, krabappel, however, stay, dead, most, episodes, end, with, the, status, quo, being, restored, though, occasionally, major, changes, will, stick, such, as, lisa, s, conversions, to, vegetarianism, and, buddhism, the, divorce, of, milhouse, van, houten, s, parents, and, the, marriage, and, subsequent, parenthood, of, apu, and, manjula, the, simpsons, takes, place, in, a, fictional, american, town, called, springfield, although, there, are, many, real, settlements, in, america, named, springfield, the, town, the, show, is, set, in, is, fictional, the, state, it, is, in, is, not, established, in, fact, the, show, is, intentionally, evasive, with, regard, to, springfield, s, location, springfield, s, geography, and, that, of, its, surroundings, is, inconsistent, from, one, episode, to, another, it, may, have, coastlines, deserts, vast, farmland, mountains, or, whatever, the, story, or, joke, requires, groening, has, said, that, springfield, has, much, in, common, with, portland, oregon, the, city, where, he, grew, up, groening, has, said, that, he, named, it, after, springfield, oregon, and, the, fictitious, springfield, which, was, the, setting, of, the, series, father, knows, best, he, figured, out, that, springfield, was, one, of, the, most, common, names, for, a, city, in, the, u, s, in, anticipation, of, the, success, of, the, show, i, thought, this, will, be, cool, everyone, will, think, it, s, their, springfield, and, they, do, many, landmarks, including, street, names, have, connections, to, portland, when, producer, james, l, brooks, was, working, on, the, television, variety, show, the, tracey, ullman, show, he, decided, to, include, small, animated, sketches, before, and, after, the, commercial, breaks, having, seen, one, of, cartoonist, matt, groening, s, life, in, hell, comic, strips, brooks, asked, groening, to, pitch, an, idea, for, a, series, of, animated, shorts, groening, initially, intended, to, present, an, animated, version, of, his, life, in, hell, series, however, groening, later, realized, that, animating, life, in, hell, would, require, the, rescinding, of, publication, rights, for, his, life, s, work, he, therefore, chose, another, approach, while, waiting, in, the, lobby, of, brooks, s, office, for, the, pitch, meeting, hurriedly, formulating, his, version, of, a, dysfunctional, family, that, became, the, simpsons, he, named, the, characters, after, his, own, family, members, substituting, bart, for, his, own, name, adopting, an, anagram, of, the, word, brat, the, simpson, family, first, appeared, as, shorts, in, the, tracey, ullman, show, on, april, 19, 1987, groening, submitted, only, basic, sketches, to, the, animators, and, assumed, that, the, figures, would, be, cleaned, up, in, production, however, the, animators, merely, re, traced, his, drawings, which, led, to, the, crude, appearance, of, the, characters, in, the, initial, shorts, the, animation, was, produced, domestically, at, klasky, csupo, with, wes, archer, david,

have, no, hairlines, she, felt, they, would, look, strange, if, they, were, flesh, colored, groening, supported, the, decision, saying, marge, is, yellow, with, blue, hair, that, s, hilarious, let, s, do, it, in, 1989, a, team, of, production, companies, adapted, the, simpsons, into, a, half, hour, series, for, the, fox, broadcasting, company, the, team, included, the, klasky, csupo, animation, house, brooks, negotiated, a, provision, in, the, contract, with, the, fox, network, that, prevented, fox, from, interfering, with, the, show, s, content, groening, said, his, goal, in, creating, the, show, was, to, offer, the, audience, an, alternative, to, what, he, called, the, mainstream, trash, that, they, were, watching, the, half, hour, series, premiered, on, december, 17, 1989, with,

enables, the, producers, to, make, jokes, about, the, entertainment, industry, and, the, press, some, commentators, say, the, show, is, political, in, nature, and, susceptible, to, a, left, wing, bias, al, jean, acknowledged, in, an, interview, that, we, are, of, liberal, bent, the, writers, often, evince, an, appreciation, for, progressive, leanings, but, the, show, makes, jokes, across, the, political, spectrum, the, show, portrays, government, and, large, corporations, as, evil, entities, that, take, advantage, of, the, common, worker, thus, the, writers, often, portray, authority, figures, in, an, unflattering, or, negative, light, in, the, simpsons, politicians, are, corrupt, ministers, such, as, reverend, lovejoy, are, dismissive, to, churchgoers, and, the, local, police, force, is, incompetent, religion, also, figures, as, a, recurring, theme, in, times, of, crisis, the, family, often, turns, to, god, and, the, show, has, dealt, with, most, of, the, major, religions, sexuality, is, often, a, source, of, jokes, in, the, series, or, serves, as, the, theme, of, certain, episodes, even, though, homosexuals, are, sometimes, sources, of, gags, the, series, often, comments, on, how, american, society, treats, them, with, homer, s, phobia, devoting, an, entire, episode, to, the, family, making, a, gay, friend, and, homer, s, initial, hostility, to, him, in, 1990, the, simpsons, became, the, first, animated, early, evening, show, to, depict, a, kiss, between, two, men, in, simpson, and, delilah, the, simpsons, opening, sequence, is, one, of, the, show, s, most, memorable, hallmarks, the, standard, opening, has, gone, through, three, iterations, a, replacement, of, some, shots, at, the, start, of, the, second, season, and, a, brand, new, sequence, when, the, show, switched, to, high, definition, in, 2009, each, has, the, same, basic, sequence, of, events, the, camera, zooms, through, cumulus, clouds, through, the, show, s, title, towards, the, town, of, springfield, the, camera, then, follows, the, members, of, the, family, on, their, way, home, upon, entering, their, house, the, simpsons, settle, down, on, their, couch, to, watch, television, the, original, opening, was, created, by, david, silverman, and, was, the, first, task, he, did, when, production, began, on, the, show, the, series, distinctive, theme, song, was, composed, by, musician, danny, elfman, in, 1989, after, groening, approached, him, requesting, a, retro, style, piece, this, piece, has, been, noted, by, elfman, as, the, most, popular, of, his, career, one, of, the, most, distinctive, aspects, of, the, opening, is, that, three, of, its, elements, change, from, episode, to, episode, bart, writes, different, things, on, the, school, chalkboard, lisa, plays, different, solos, on, her, saxophone, or, occasionally, a, different, instrument, and, different, gags, accompany, the, family, as, they, enter, their, living, room, to, sit, on, the, couch, the, special, halloween, episode, has, become, an, annual, tradition, treehouse, of, horror, first, broadcast, in, 1990, as, part, of, season, two, and, established, the, pattern, of, three, separate, self, contained, stories, in, each, halloween, episode, these, pieces, usually, involve, the, family, in, some, horror, science, fiction, or, supernatural, setting, and, often, parody, or, pay, homage, to, a, famous, piece, of, work, in, those, genres, they, always, take, place, outside, the, normal, continuity, of, the, show, although, the, treehouse, series, is, meant, to, be, seen, on, halloween, this, changed, by, the, 2000s, and, again, in, 2020, when, new, installments, have, premiered, after, halloween, due, to, fox, s, current, contract, with, major, league, baseball, s, world, series, prior, to, 2020, between, 2011, and, 2019, every, treehouse, of, horror, episode, had, aired, in, october, the, show, s, humor, turns, on, cultural, references, that, cover, a, wide, spectrum, of, society, so, that, viewers, from, all, generations, can, enjoy, the, show, such, references, for, example, come, from, movies, television, music, literature, science, and, history, the, animators, also, regularly, add, jokes, or, sight, gags, into, the, show, s, background, via, humorous, or, incongruous, bits, of, text, in, signs, newspapers, billboards, and, elsewhere, the, audience, may, often, not, notice, the, visual, jokes, in, a, single, viewing, some, are, so, fleeting, that, they, become, apparent, only, by, pausing, a, video, recording, of, the, show, or, viewing, it, in, slow, motion, kristin, thompson, argues, that, the, simpsons, uses, a, flurry, of, cultural, references, intentionally, inconsistent, characterization, and, considerable, self, reflexivity, about, television, conventions, and, the, status, of, the, programme, as, a, television, show, one, of, bart, s, early, hallmarks, was, his, prank, calls, to, moe, s, tavern, owner, moe, szyslak, where, he, asks, for, a, gag, name, moe, tries, to, find, that, person, in, the, bar, but, soon, realizes, it, is, a, prank, call, and, angrily, threatens, bart, these, calls, were, apparently, based, on, a, series, of, prank, calls, known, as, the, tube, bar, recordings, though, groening, has, denied, any, causal, connection, moe, was, based, partly, on, tube, bar, owner, louis, red, deutsch, whose, often, profane, responses, inspired, moe, s, violent, side, as, the, series, progressed, it, became, more, difficult, for, the, writers, to, come, up, with, a, fake, name, and, to, write, moe, s, angry, response, and, the, pranks, were, dropped, as, a, regular, joke, during, the, fourth, season, the, simpsons, also, often, includes, self, referential, humor, the, most, common, form, is, jokes, about, fox, broadcasting, for, example, the, episode, she, used, to, be, my, girl, included, a, scene, in, which, a, fox, news, channel, van, drove, down, the, street, while, displaying, a, large, bush, cheney, 2004, banner, and, playing, queen, s, we, are, the, champions, in, reference, to, the, 2004, u, s, presidential, election, and, claims, of, conservative, bias, in, fox, news, the, show, uses, catchphrases, and, most, of, the, primary, and, secondary, characters, have, at, least, one, each, notable, expressions, include, homer, s, annoyed, grunt, d, oh, mr, burns, excellent, and, nelson, muntz, s, ha, ha, some, of, bart, s, catchphrases, such, as, ay, caramba, don, t, have, a, cow, man, and, eat, my, shorts, appeared, on, t, shirts, in, the, show, s, early, days, however, bart, rarely, used, the, latter, two, phrases, until, after, they, became, popular, through, the, merchandising, the, use, of, many, of, these, catchphrases, has, declined, in, recent, seasons, the, episode, bart, gets, famous, mocks, catchphrase, based, humor, as, bart, achieves, fame, on, the, krusty, the, clown, show, solely, for, saying, i, didn, t, do, it, the, simpsons, has, gained, notoriety, for, jokes, that, appeared, to, become, reality, perhaps, the, most, famous, example, comes, from, the, episode, bart, to, the, future, which, mentions, billionaire, donald, trump, having, been, president, of, the, united, states, at, one, time, and, leaving, the, nation, broke, the, episode, first, aired, in, 2000, sixteen, years, before, trump, who, at, the, time, was, exploring, a, presidential, run, was, elected, another, episode, when, you, dish, upon, a, star, lampooned, 20th, century, fox, as, a, division, of, the, walt, disney, company, nineteen, years, later, disney, purchased, fox, other, examples, purported, as, the, simpsons, predicting, the, future, include, the, introduction, of, the, smartwatch, video, chat, services, richard, branson, s, spaceflight, and, lady, gaga, s, acrobatic, performance, at, the, super, bowl, li, halftime, show, al, jean, has, commented, on, the, show, s, purported, ability, to, predict, the, future, explaining, that, they, re, really, just, educated, guesses, and, stating, that, if, you, throw, enough, darts, you, re, going, to, get, some, bullseyes, producer, bill, oakley, stated, there, are, very, few, cases, where, the, simpsons, predicted, something, it, s, mainly, just, coincidence, because, the, episodes, are, so, old, that, history, repeats, itself, fact, checking, sources, such, as, snopes, have, debunked, many, of, the, claimed, prophecies, explaining, that, the, show, s, extensive, run, means, a, lot, of, jokes, and, a, lot, of, opportunities, for, coincidences, to, appear, and, most, of, these, predictions, have, rather, simple, and, mundane, explanations, for, example, the, device, shown, on, the, simpsons, with, autocorrection, is, an, apple, newton, a, real, 1993, device, notorious, for, its, poor, handwriting, recognition, technologically, advanced, watches, have, appeared, in, numerous, works, of, fiction, decades, before, the, simpsons, a, number, of, neologisms, that, originated, on, the, simpsons, have, entered, popular, vernacular, mark, liberman, director, of, the, linguistic, data, consortium, remarked, the, simpsons, has, apparently, taken, over, from, shakespeare, and, the, bible, as, our, culture, s, greatest, source, of, idioms, catchphrases, and, sundry, other, textual, allusions, the, most, famous, catchphrase, is, homer, s, annoyed, grunt, d, oh, so, ubiquitous, is, the, expression, that, it, is, now, listed, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, but, without, the, apostrophe, dan, castellaneta, says, he, borrowed, the, phrase, from, james, finlayson, an, actor, in, many, laurel, and, hardy, comedies, who, pronounced, it, in, a, more, elongated, and, whining, tone, the, staff, of, the, simpsons, told, castellaneta, to, shorten, the, noise, and, it, went, on, to, become, the, well, known, exclamation, in, the, television, series, groundskeeper, willie, s, description, of, the, french, as, cheese, eating, surrender, monkeys, was, used, by, national, review, columnist, jonah, goldberg, in, 2003, after, france, s, opposition, to, the, proposed, invasion, of, iraq, the, phrase, quickly, spread, to, other, journalists, cromulent, and, embiggen, words, used, in, lisa, the, iconoclast, have, since, appeared, in, the, dictionary, com, s, 21st, century, lexicon, and, scientific, journals, respectively, kwyjibo, a, fake, scrabble, word, invented, by, bart, in, bart, the, genius, was, used, as, one, of, the, aliases, of, the, creator, of, the, melissa, worm, i, for, one, welcome, our, new, insect, overlords, was, used, by, kent, brockman, in, deep, space, homer, and, has, become, a, snowclone, with, variants, of, the, utterance, used, to, express, obsequious, submission, it, has, been, used, in, media, such, as, new, scientist, magazine, the, dismissive, term, meh, believed, to, have, been, popularized, by, the, show, entered, the, collins, english, dictionary, in, 2008, other, words, credited, as, stemming, from, the, show, include, yoink, and, craptacular, the, oxford, dictionary, of, modern, quotations, includes, several, quotations, from, the, show, as, well, as, cheese, eating, surrender, monkeys, homer,

short, films, about, springfield, season, 7, 1996, the, simpsons, was, the, first, successful, animated, program, in, american, prime, time, since, wait, till, your, father, gets, home, in, the, 1970s, during, most, of, the, 1980s, us, pundits, considered, animated, shows, as, appropriate, only, for, children, and, animating, a, show, was, too, expensive, to, achieve, a, quality, suitable, for, prime, time, television, the, simpsons, changed, this, perception, initially, leading, to, a, short, period, where, networks, attempted, to, recreate, prime, time, cartoon, success, with, shows, like, capitol, critters, fish, police, and, family, dog, which, were, expensive, and, unsuccessful, the, simpsons, use, of, korean, animation, studios, for, tweening, coloring, and, filming, made, the, episodes, cheaper, the, success, of, the, simpsons, and, the, lower, production, cost, prompted, us, television, networks, to, take, chances, on, other, adult, animated, series, this, development, led, us, producers, to, a, 1990s, boom, in, new, animated, prime, time, shows, for, adults, such, as, beavis, and, butt, head, south, park, family, guy, king, of, the, hill, futurama, which, was, created, by, matt, groening, and, the, critic, which, was, also, produced, by, gracie, films, for, family, guy, creator, seth, macfarlane, the, simpsons, created, an, audience, for, prime, time, animation, that, had, not, been, there, for, many, many, years, as, far, as, i, m, concerned, they, basically, re, invented, the, wheel, they, created, what, is, in, many, ways, you, could, classify, it, as, a, wholly, new, medium, the, simpsons, has, had, crossovers, with, four, other, shows, in, the, episode, a, star, is, burns, marge, invites, jay, sherman, the, main, character, of, the, critic, to, be, a, judge, for, a, film, festival, in, springfield, matt, groening, had, his, name, removed, from, the, episode, since, he, had, no, involvement, with, the, critic, south, park, later, paid, homage, to, the, simpsons, with, the, episode, simpsons, already, did, it, in, simpsorama, the, planet, express, crew, from, futurama, come, to, springfield, in, the, present, to, prevent, the, simpsons, from, destroying, the, future, in, the, family, guy, episode, the, simpsons, guy, the, griffins, visit, springfield, and, meet, the, simpsons, the, simpsons, has, also, influenced, live, action, shows, like, malcolm, in, the, middle, which, featured, the, use, of, sight, gags, and, did, not, use, a, laugh, track, unlike, most, sitcoms, malcolm, in, the, middle,

for, its, very, strong, resemblance, with, the, simpsons, which, its, creator, shalva, ramishvili, has, acknowledged, the, simpsons, has, historically, been, open, to, portrayals, of, lgbt, characters, and, settings, and, it, has, routinely, challenged, heteronormativity, it, was, one, of, several, animated, television, shows, in, the, united, states, that, began, introducing,

the, pauper, season, nine, 1997, is, one, of, the, most, controversial, episodes, of, the, simpsons, many, fans, and, critics, reacted, negatively, to, the, revelation, that, seymour, skinner, a, recurring, character, since, the, first, season, was, an, impostor, the, episode, has, been, criticized, by, groening, and, by, harry, shearer, who, provides, the, voice, of, skinner, in, a, 2001, interview, shearer, recalled, that, after, reading, the, script, he, told, the, writers, that, s, so, wrong, you, re, taking, something, that, an, audience, has, built, eight, years, or, nine, years, of, investment, in, and, just, tossed, it, in, the, trash, can, for, no, good, reason, for, a, story, we, ve, done, before, with, other, characters, it, s, so, arbitrary, and, gratuitous, and, it, s, disrespectful, to, the, audience, the, show, has, reportedly, been, taken, off, the, air, in, several, countries, china, banned, it, from, prime, time, television, in, august, 2006, in, an, effort, to, protect, china, s, struggling, animation, studios, in, 2008, venezuela, barred, the, show, from, airing, on, morning, television, as, it, was, deemed, unsuitable, for, children, the, same, year, several, russian, pentecostal, churches, demanded, that, the, simpsons, south, park, and, some, other, western, cartoons, be, removed, from, broadcast, schedules, for, propaganda, of, various, vices, and, the, broadcaster, s, license, to, be, revoked, however, a, court, decision, later, dismissed, this, request, critics, reviews, of, early, simpsons, episodes, praised, the, show, for, its, sassy, humor, wit, realism, and, intelligence, however, in, the, late, 1990s, around, the, airing, of, season, 10, the, tone, and, emphasis, of, the, show, began, to, change, some, critics, started, calling, the, show, tired, by, 2000, some, long, term, fans, had, become, disillusioned, with, the, show, and, pointed, to, its, shift, from, character, driven, plots, to, what, they, perceived, as, an, overemphasis, on, zany, antics, jim, schembri, of, the, sydney, morning, herald, attributed, the, decline, in, quality, to, an, abandonment, of, character, driven, storylines, in, favor, of, celebrity, cameo, appearances, and, references, to, popular, culture, schembri, wrote, in, 2011, the, central, tragedy, of, the, simpsons, is, that, it, has, gone, from, commanding, attention, to, merely, being, attention, seeking, it, began, by, proving, that, cartoon, characters, don, t, have, to, be, caricatures, they, can, be, invested, with, real, emotions, now, the, show, has, in, essence, fermented, into, a, limp, parody, of, itself, memorable, story, arcs, have, been, sacrificed, for, the, sake, of, celebrity, walk, ons, and, punchline, hungry, dialogue, in, 2010, the, bbc, noted, the, common, consensus, is, that, the, simpsons, golden, era, ended, after, season, nine, and, todd, leopold, of, cnn, in, an, article, looking, at, its, perceived, decline, stated, for, many, fans, the, glory, days, are, long, past, similarly, tyler, wilson, of, coeur, d, alene, press, has, referred, to, seasons, one, to, nine, as, the, show, s, golden, age, and, ian, nathan, of, empire, described, the, show, s, classic, era, as, being, say, the, first, ten, seasons, jon, heacock, of, lucidworks, stated, that, for, the, first, ten, years, the, show, was, consistently, at, the, top, of, its, game, with, so, many, moments, quotations, and, references, both, epic, and, obscure, that, helped, turn, the, simpson, family, into, the, cultural, icons, that, they, remain, to, this, day, mike, scully, who, was, showrunner, during, seasons, nine, through, twelve, has, been, the, subject, of, criticism, chris, suellentrop, of, slate, wrote, that, under, scully, s, tenure, the, simpsons, became, well, a, cartoon, episodes, that, once, would, have, ended, with, homer, and, marge, bicycling, into, the, sunset, now, end, with, homer, blowing, a, tranquilizer, dart, into, marge, s, neck, the, show, s, still, funny, but, it, hasn, t, been, touching, in, years, when, asked, in, 2007, how, the, series, longevity, is, sustained, scully, joked, lower, your, quality, standards, once, you, ve, done, that, you, can, go, on, forever, al, jean, who, was, showrunner, during, seasons, thirteen, through, thirty, three, has, also, been, the, subject, of, criticism, with, some, arguing, that, the, show, has, continued, to, decline, in, quality, under, his, tenure, former, writers, have, complained, that, under, jean, the, show, is, on, auto, pilot, too, sentimental, and, the, episodes, are, just, being, cranked, out, some, critics, believe, that, the, show, has, entered, a, steady, decline, under, jean, and, is, no, longer, really, funny, john, ortved, author, of, the, simpsons, an, uncensored, unauthorized, history, characterized, the, jean, era, as, toothless, and, criticized, what, he, perceived, as, the, show, s, increase, in, social, and, political, commentary, jean, responded, well, it, s, possible, that, we, ve, declined, but, honestly, i, ve, been, here, the, whole, time, and, i, do, remember, in, season, two, people, saying, it, s, gone, downhill, if, we, d, listened, to, that, then, we, would, have, stopped, after, episode, 13, i, m, glad, we, didn, t, in, 2004, cast, member, harry, shearer, criticized, what, he, perceived, as, the, show, s, declining, quality, i, rate, the, last, three, seasons, as, among, the, worst, so, season, four, looks, very, good, to, me, now, cast, member, dan, castellaneta, responded, i, don, t, agree, i, think, harry, s, issue, is, that, the, show, isn, t, as, grounded, as, it, was, in, the, first, three, or, four, seasons, that, it, s, gotten, crazy, or, a, little, more, madcap, i, think, it, organically, changes, to, stay, fresh, also, in, 2004, author, douglas, coupland, described, claims, of, declining, quality, in, the, series, as, hogwash, saying, the, simpsons, hasn, t, fumbled, the, ball, in, fourteen, years, it, s, hardly, likely, to, fumble, it, now, in, an, april, 2006, interview, groening, said, i, honestly, don, t, see, any, end, in, sight, i, think, it, s, possible, that, the, show, will, get, too, financially, cumbersome, but, right, now, the, show, is, creatively, i, think, as, good, or, better, than, it, s, ever, been, the, animation, is, incredibly, detailed, and, imaginative, the, stories, do, things, that, we, haven, t, done, before, so, creatively, there, s, no, reason, to, quit, in, 2016, popular, culture, writer, anna, leszkiewicz, suggested, that, even, though, the, simpsons, still, holds, cultural, relevance, contemporary, appeal, is, only, for, the, first, ten, or, so, seasons, with, recent, episodes, only, garnering, mainstream, attention, when, a, favorite, character, from, the, golden, era, is, killed, off, or, when, new, information, and, shock, twists, are, given, for, old, characters, the, series, ratings, have, also, declined, while, the, first, season, enjoyed, an, average, of, 13, 4, million, viewing, households, per, episode, in, the, u, s, the, twenty, first, season, had, an, average, of, 7, 2, million, viewers, alan, sepinwall, and, matt, zoller, seitz, argued, in, their, 2016, book, titled, tv, the, book, that, the, peak, of, the, simpsons, are, roughly, seasons, 3, 12, and, that, despite, the, decline, episodes, from, the, later, seasons, such, as, eternal, moonshine, of, the, simpson, mind, and, holidays, of, future, passed, could, be, considered, on, par, with, the, earlier, classic, episodes, further, stating, that, even, if, you, want, to, call, the, show, today, a, thin, shadow, of, its, former, self, think, about, how, mind, boggingly, great, its, former, self, had, to, be, for, so, diminished, a, version, to, be, watchable, at, all, in, 2020, uproxx, writer, josh, kurp, stated, that, while, he, agrees, with, the, sentiment, that, the, simpsons, is, not, as, good, as, it, used, to, be, it, is, because, it, was, working, at, a, level, of, comedy, and, characterization, that, no, show, ever, has, he, felt, there, were, still, many, reasons, to, watch, the, series, as, it, was, still, capable, of, quality, television, and, even, the, occasional, new, classic, and, the, fact, that, the, show, was, willing, to, experiment, giving, examples, such, as, bringing, on, guest, animators, like, don, hertzfeldt, and, sylvain, chomet, to, produce, couch, gags, and, guest, writers, like, seth, rogen, and, evan, goldberg, pete, holmes, and, megan, amram, to, write, episodes, in, the, season, 32, episode, i, carumbus, the, show, itself, makes, a, nod, to, these, concerns, in, its, credits, gag, where, the, god, jupiter, notes, that, it, definitely, feels, like, they, re, wrapping, it, up, any, day, now, in, a, 2021, interview, with, nme, jean, was, quoted, as, saying, to, people, who, say, the, simpsons, isn, t, as, good, as, it, used, to, be, i, would, say, i, think, the, world, isn, t, as, good, as, it, used, to, be, but, we, re, declining, at, a, slower, rate, the, stereotypical, nature, of, the, character, apu, nahasapeemapetilon, has, been, the, subject, of, controversy, indian, american, comedian, hari, kondabolu, stated, in, his, 2017, documentary, the, problem, with, apu, that, as, a, child, he, was, a, fan, of, the, simpsons, and, liked, apu, but, he, now, finds, the, character, s, stereotypical, nature, troublesome, defenders, of, the, character, responded, that, the, show, is, built, on, comical, stereotypes, with, creator, matt, groening, saying, that, s, the, nature, of, cartooning, he, added, that, he, was, proud, of, what, we, do, on, the, show, and, it, s, a, time, in, our, culture, where, people, love, to, pretend, they, re, offended, in, response, to, the, controversy, apu, s, voice, actor, hank, azaria, said, he, was, willing, to, step, aside, from, his, role, as, apu, the, most, important, thing, is, to, listen, to, south, asian, people, indian, people, in, this, country, when, they, talk, about, what, they, feel, and, how, they, think, about, this, character, in, february, 2020, he, confirmed, that, he, would, no, longer, voice, apu, groening, stated, at, the, same, time, that, the, character, would, remain, in, the, show, the, criticisms, were, referenced, in, the, season, 29, episode, no, good, read, goes, unpunished, when, lisa, breaks, the, fourth, wall, and, addresses, the, audience, by, saying, something, that, started, decades, ago, and, was, applauded, and, inoffensive, is, now, politically, incorrect, what, can, you, do, to, which, marge, replies, some, things, will, be, addressed, at, a, later, date, lisa, adds, if, at, all, this, reference, was, clarified, by, the, fact, that, there, was, a, framed, photo, of, apu, with, the, caption, on, the, photo, saying, don, t, have, a, cow, apu, a, play, on, bart, s, catchphrase, don, t, have, a, cow, man, as, well, as, the, fact, that, many, hindus, do, not, eat,
