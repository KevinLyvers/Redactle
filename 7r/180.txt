a, teacher, also, called, a, schoolteacher, or, formally, an, educator, is, a, person, who, helps, students, to, acquire, knowledge, competence, or, virtue, via, the, practice, of, teaching, informally, the, role, of, teacher, may, be, taken, on, by, anyone, e, g, when, showing, a, colleague, how, to, perform, a, specific, task, in, some, countries, teaching, young, people, of, school, age, may, be, carried, out, in, an, informal, setting, such, as, within, the, family, homeschooling, rather, than, in, a, formal, setting, such, as, a, school, or, college, some, other, professions, may, involve, a, significant, amount, of, teaching, e, g, youth, worker, pastor, in, most, countries, formal, teaching, of, students, is, usually, carried, out, by, paid, professional, teachers, this, article, focuses, on, those, who, are, employed, as, their, main, role, to, teach, others, in, a, formal, education, context, such, as, at, a, school, or, other, place, of, initial, formal, education, or, training, a, teacher, s, role, may, vary, among, cultures, teachers, may, provide, instruction, in, literacy, and, numeracy, craftsmanship, or, vocational, training, the, arts, religion, civics, community, roles, or, life, skills, formal, teaching, tasks, include, preparing, lessons, according, to, agreed, curricula, giving, lessons, and, assessing, pupil, progress, a, teacher, s, professional, duties, may, extend, beyond, formal, teaching, outside, of, the, classroom, teachers, may, accompany, students, on, field, trips, supervise, study, halls, help, with, the, organization, of, school, functions, and, serve, as, supervisors, for, extracurricular, activities, they, also, have, the, legal, duty, to, protect, students, from, harm, such, as, that, which, may, result, from, bullying, sexual, harassment, racism, or, abuse, in, some, education, systems, teachers, may, be, responsible, for, student, discipline, teaching, is, a, highly, complex, activity, this, is, partially, because, teaching, is, a, social, practice, that, takes, place, in, a, specific, context, time, place, culture, socioeconomic, situation, etc, and, therefore, is, shaped, by, the, values, of, that, specific, context, factors, that, influence, what, is, expected, or, required, of, teachers, include, history, and, tradition, social, views, about, the, purpose, of, education, accepted, theories, about, learning, etc, the, competences, required, by, a, teacher, are, affected, by, the, different, ways, in, which, the, role, is, understood, around, the, world, broadly, there, seem, to, be, four, models, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, has, argued, that, it, is, necessary, to, develop, a, shared, definition, of, the, skills, and, knowledge, required, by, teachers, in, order, to, guide, teachers, career, long, education, and, professional, development, some, evidence, based, international, discussions, have, tried, to, reach, such, a, common, understanding, for, example, the, european, union, has, identified, three, broad, areas, of, competences, that, teachers, require, scholarly, consensus, is, emerging, that, what, is, required, of, teachers, can, be, grouped, under, three, headings, it, has, been, found, that, teachers, who, showed, enthusiasm, towards, the, course, materials, and, students, can, create, a, positive, learning, experience, these, teachers, do, not, teach, by, rote, but, attempt, to, invigorate, their, teaching, of, the, course, materials, every, day, teachers, who, cover, the, same, curriculum, repeatedly, may, find, it, challenging, to, maintain, their, enthusiasm, lest, their, boredom, with, the, content, bore, their, students, in, turn, enthusiastic, teachers, are, rated, higher, by, their, students, than, teachers, who, did, not, show, much, enthusiasm, for, the, course, materials, teachers, that, exhibit, enthusiasm, are, more, likely, to, have, engaged, interested, and, energetic, students, who, are, curious, about, learning, the, subject, matter, recent, research, has, found, a, correlation, between, teacher, enthusiasm, and, students, intrinsic, motivation, to, learn, and, vitality, in, the, classroom, controlled, experimental, studies, exploring, intrinsic, motivation, of, college, students, has, shown, that, nonverbal, expressions, of, enthusiasm, such, as, demonstrative, gesturing, dramatic, movements, which, are, varied, and, emotional, facial, expressions, result, in, college, students, reporting, higher, levels, of, intrinsic, motivation, to, learn, but, even, while, a, teacher, s, enthusiasm, has, been, shown, to, improve, motivation, and, increase, task, engagement, it, does, not, necessarily, improve, learning, outcomes, or, memory, for, the, material, there, are, various, mechanisms, by, which, teacher, enthusiasm, may, facilitate, higher, levels, of, intrinsic, motivation, teacher, enthusiasm, may, contribute, to, a, classroom, atmosphere, of, energy, and, enthusiasm, which, feeds, student, interest, and, excitement, in, learning, the, subject, matter, enthusiastic, teachers, may, also, lead, to, students, becoming, more, self, determined, in, their, own, learning, process, the, concept, of, mere, exposure, indicates, that, the, teacher, s, enthusiasm, may, contribute, to, the, student, s, expectations, about, intrinsic, motivation, in, the, context, of, learning, also, enthusiasm, may, act, as, a, motivational, embellishment, increasing, a, student, s, interest, by, the, variety, novelty, and, surprise, of, the, enthusiastic, teacher, s, presentation, of, the, material, finally, the, concept, of, emotional, contagion, may, also, apply, students, may, become, more, intrinsically, motivated, by, catching, onto, the, enthusiasm, and, energy, of, the, teacher, research, shows, that, student, motivation, and, attitudes, towards, school, are, closely, linked, to, student, teacher, relationships, enthusiastic, teachers, are, particularly, good, at, creating, beneficial, relations, with, their, students, their, ability, to, create, effective, learning, environments, that, foster, student, achievement, depends, on, the, kind, of, relationship, they, build, with, their, students, useful, teacher, to, student, interactions, are, crucial, in, linking, academic, success, with, personal, achievement, here, personal, success, is, a, student, s, internal, goal, of, improving, themselves, whereas, academic, success, includes, the, goals, they, receive, from, their, superior, a, teacher, must, guide, their, student, in, aligning, their, personal, goals, with, their, academic, goals, students, who, receive, this, positive, influence, show, stronger, self, confidence, and, greater, personal, and, academic, success, than, those, without, these, teacher, interactions, students, are, likely, to, build, stronger, relations, with, teachers, who, are, friendly, and, supportive, and, will, show, more, interest, in, courses, taught, by, these, teachers, teachers, that, spend, more, time, interacting, and, working, directly, with, students, are, perceived, as, supportive, and, effective, teachers, effective, teachers, have, been, shown, to, invite, student, participation, and, decision, making, allow, humor, into, their, classroom, and, demonstrate, a, willingness, to, play, in, many, countries, a, person, who, wishes, to, become, a, teacher, must, first, obtain, specified, professional, qualifications, or, credentials, from, a, university, or, college, these, professional, qualifications, may, include, the, study, of, pedagogy, the, science, of, teaching, teachers, like, other, professionals, may, have, to, or, choose, to, continue, their, education, after, they, qualify, a, process, known, as, continuing, professional, development, the, issue, of, teacher, qualifications, is, linked, to, the, status, of, the, profession, in, some, societies, teachers, enjoy, a, status, on, a, par, with, physicians, lawyers, engineers, and, accountants, in, others, the, status, of, the, profession, is, low, in, the, twentieth, century, many, intelligent, women, were, unable, to, get, jobs, in, corporations, or, governments, so, many, chose, teaching, as, a, default, profession, as, women, become, more, welcomed, into, corporations, and, governments, today, it, may, be, more, difficult, to, attract, qualified, teachers, in, the, future, teachers, are, often, required, to, undergo, a, course, of, initial, education, at, a, college, of, education, to, ensure, that, they, possess, the, necessary, knowledge, competences, and, adhere, to, relevant, codes, of, ethics, there, are, a, variety, of, bodies, designed, to, instill, preserve, and, update, the, knowledge, and, professional, standing, of, teachers, around, the, world, many, teachers, colleges, exist, they, may, be, controlled, by, government, or, by, the, teaching, profession, itself, they, are, generally, established, to, serve, and, protect, the, public, interest, through, certifying, governing, quality, controlling, and, enforcing, standards, of, practice, for, the, teaching, profession, the, functions, of, the, teachers, colleges, may, include, setting, out, clear, standards, of, practice, providing, for, the, ongoing, education, of, teachers, investigating, complaints, involving, members, conducting, hearings, into, allegations, of, professional, misconduct, and, taking, appropriate, disciplinary, action, and, accrediting, teacher, education, programs, in, many, situations, teachers, in, publicly, funded, schools, must, be, members, in, good, standing, with, the, college, and, private, schools, may, also, require, their, teachers, to, be, college, members, in, other, areas, these, roles, may, belong, to, the, state, board, of, education, the, superintendent, of, public, instruction, the, state, education, agency, or, other, governmental, bodies, in, still, other, areas, teaching, unions, may, be, responsible, for, some, or, all, of, these, duties, misconduct, by, teachers, especially, sexual, misconduct, has, been, getting, increased, scrutiny, from, the, media, and, the, courts, a, study, by, the, american, association, of, university, women, reported, that, 9, 6, of, students, in, the, united, states, claim, to, have, received, unwanted, sexual, attention, from, an, adult, associated, with, education, be, they, a, volunteer, bus, driver, teacher, administrator, or, other, adult, sometime, during, their, educational, career, a, study, in, england, showed, a, 0, 3, prevalence, of, sexual, abuse, by, any, professional, a, group, that, included, priests, religious, leaders, and, case, workers, as, well, as, teachers, it, is, important, to, note, however, that, this, british, study, is, the, only, one, of, its, kind, and, consisted, of, a, random, probability, sample, of, 2, 869, young, people, between, the, ages, of, 18, and, 24, in, a, computer, assisted, study, and, that, the, questions, referred, to, sexual, abuse, with, a, professional, not, necessarily, a, teacher, it, is, therefore, logical, to, conclude, that, information, on, the, percentage, of, abuses, by, teachers, in, the, united, kingdom, is, not, explicitly, available, and, therefore, not, necessarily, reliable, the, aauw, study, however, posed, questions, about, fourteen, types, of, sexual, harassment, and, various, degrees, of, frequency, and, included, only, abuses, by, teachers, the, sample, was, drawn, from, a, list, of, 80, 000, schools, to, create, a, stratified, two, stage, sample, design, of, 2, 065, 8th, to, 11th, grade, students, its, reliability, was, gauged, at, 95, with, a, 4, margin, of, error, in, the, united, states, especially, several, high, profile, cases, such, as, debra, lafave, pamela, rogers, turner, and, mary, kay, letourneau, have, caused, increased, scrutiny, on, teacher, misconduct, chris, keates, the, general, secretary, of, national, association, of, schoolmasters, union, of, women, teachers, said, that, teachers, who, have, sex, with, pupils, over, the, age, of, consent, should, not, be, placed, on, the, sex, offenders, register, and, that, prosecution, for, statutory, rape, is, a, real, anomaly, in, the, law, that, we, are, concerned, about, this, has, led, to, outrage, from, child, protection, and, parental, rights, groups, fears, of, being, labelled, a, pedophile, or, hebephile, has, led, to, several, men, who, enjoy, teaching, avoiding, the, profession, this, has, in, some, jurisdictions, reportedly, led, to, a, shortage, of, male, teachers, teachers, facilitate, student, learning, often, in, a, school, or, academy, or, perhaps, in, another, environment, such, as, outdoors, the, objective, is, typically, accomplished, through, either, an, informal, or, formal, approach, to, learning, including, a, course, of, study, and, lesson, plan, that, teaches, skills, knowledge, or, thinking, skills, different, ways, to, teach, are, often, referred, to, as, pedagogy, when, deciding, what, teaching, method, to, use, teachers, consider, students, background, knowledge, environment, and, their, learning, goals, as, well, as, standardized, curricula, as, determined, by, the, relevant, authority, many, times, teachers, assist, in, learning, outside, of, the, classroom, by, accompanying, students, on, field, trips, the, increasing, use, of, technology, specifically, the, rise, of, the, internet, over, the, past, decade, has, begun, to, shape, the, way, teachers, approach, their, roles, in, the, classroom, the, objective, is, typically, a, course, of, study, lesson, plan, or, a, practical, skill, a, teacher, may, follow, standardized, curricula, as, determined, by, the, relevant, authority, the, teacher, may, interact, with, students, of, different, ages, from, infants, to, adults, students, with, different, abilities, and, students, with, learning, disabilities, teaching, using, pedagogy, also, involve, assessing, the, educational, levels, of, the, students, on, particular, skills, understanding, the, pedagogy, of, the, students, in, a, classroom, involves, using, differentiated, instruction, as, well, as, supervision, to, meet, the, needs, of, all, students, in, the, classroom, pedagogy, can, be, thought, of, in, two, manners, first, teaching, itself, can, be, taught, in, many, different, ways, hence, using, a, pedagogy, of, teaching, styles, second, the, pedagogy, of, the, learners, comes, into, play, when, a, teacher, assesses, the, pedagogic, diversity, of, their, students, and, differentiates, for, the, individual, students, accordingly, for, example, an, experienced, teacher, and, parent, described, the, place, of, a, teacher, in, learning, as, follows, the, real, bulk, of, learning, takes, place, in, self, study, and, problem, solving, with, a, lot, of, feedback, around, that, loop, the, function, of, the, teacher, is, to, pressure, the, lazy, inspire, the, bored, deflate, the, cocky, encourage, the, timid, detect, and, correct, individual, flaws, and, broaden, the, viewpoint, of, all, this, function, looks, like, that, of, a, coach, using, the, whole, gamut, of, psychology, to, get, each, new, class, of, rookies, off, the, bench, and, into, the, game, perhaps, the, most, significant, difference, between, primary, school, and, secondary, school, teaching, is, the, relationship, between, teachers, and, children, in, primary, schools, each, class, has, a, teacher, who, stays, with, them, for, most, of, the, week, and, will, teach, them, the, whole, curriculum, in, secondary, schools, they, will, be, taught, by, different, subject, specialists, each, session, during, the, week, and, may, have, ten, or, more, different, teachers, the, relationship, between, children, and, their, teachers, tends, to, be, closer, in, the, primary, school, where, they, act, as, form, tutor, specialist, teacher, and, surrogate, parent, during, the, course, of, the, day, this, is, true, throughout, most, of, the, united, states, as, well, however, alternative, approaches, for, primary, education, do, exist, one, of, these, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, platoon, system, involves, placing, a, group, of, students, together, in, one, class, that, moves, from, one, specialist, to, another, for, every, subject, the, advantage, here, is, that, students, learn, from, teachers, who, specialize, in, one, subject, and, who, tend, to, be, more, knowledgeable, in, that, one, area, than, a, teacher, who, teaches, many, subjects, students, still, derive, a, strong, sense, of, security, by, staying, with, the, same, group, of, peers, for, all, classes, co, teaching, has, also, become, a, new, trend, amongst, educational, institutions, co, teaching, is, defined, as, two, or, more, teachers, working, harmoniously, to, fulfill, the, needs, of, every, student, in, the, classroom, co, teaching, focuses, the, student, on, learning, by, providing, a, social, networking, support, that, allows, them, to, reach, their, full, cognitive, potential, co, teachers, work, in, sync, with, one, another, to, create, a, climate, of, learning, throughout, the, history, of, education, the, most, common, form, of, school, discipline, was, corporal, punishment, while, a, child, was, in, school, a, teacher, was, expected, to, act, as, a, substitute, parent, with, all, the, normal, forms, of, parental, discipline, open, to, them, in, past, times, corporal, punishment, spanking, or, paddling, or, caning, or, strapping, or, birching, the, student, in, order, to, cause, physical, pain, was, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, school, discipline, throughout, much, of, the, world, most, western, countries, and, some, others, have, now, banned, it, but, it, remains, lawful, in, the, united, states, following, a, us, supreme, court, decision, in, 1977, which, held, that, paddling, did, not, violate, the, us, constitution, 30, us, states, have, banned, corporal, punishment, the, others, mostly, in, the, south, have, not, it, is, still, used, to, a, significant, though, declining, degree, in, some, public, schools, in, alabama, arkansas, georgia, louisiana, mississippi, oklahoma, tennessee, and, texas, private, schools, in, these, and, most, other, states, may, also, use, it, corporal, punishment, in, american, schools, is, administered, to, the, seat, of, the, student, s, trousers, or, skirt, with, a, specially, made, wooden, paddle, this, often, used, to, take, place, in, the, classroom, or, hallway, but, nowadays, the, punishment, is, usually, given, privately, in, the, principal, s, office, official, corporal, punishment, often, by, caning, remains, commonplace, in, schools, in, some, asian, african, and, caribbean, countries, currently, detention, is, one, of, the, most, common, punishments, in, schools, in, the, united, states, the, uk, ireland, singapore, and, other, countries, it, requires, the, pupil, to, remain, in, school, at, a, given, time, in, the, school, day, such, as, lunch, recess, or, after, school, or, even, to, attend, school, on, a, non, school, day, e, g, saturday, detention, held, at, some, schools, during, detention, students, normally, have, to, sit, in, a, classroom, and, do, work, write, lines, or, a, punishment, essay, or, sit, quietly, a, modern, example, of, school, discipline, in, north, america, and, western, europe, relies, upon, the, idea, of, an, assertive, teacher, who, is, prepared, to, impose, their, will, upon, a, class, positive, reinforcement, is, balanced, with, immediate, and, fair, punishment, for, misbehavior, and, firm, clear, boundaries, define, what, is, appropriate, and, inappropriate, behavior, teachers, are, expected, to, respect, their, students, sarcasm, and, attempts, to, humiliate, pupils, are, seen, as, falling, outside, of, what, constitutes, reasonable, discipline, whilst, this, is, the, consensus, viewpoint, amongst, the, majority, of, academics, some, teachers, and, parents, advocate, a, more, assertive, and, confrontational, style, of, discipline, refer, to, canter, model, of, discipline, such, individuals, claim, that, many, problems, with, modern, schooling, stem, from, the, weakness, in, school, discipline, and, if, teachers, exercised, firm, control, over, the, classroom, they, would, be, able, to, teach, more, efficiently, this, viewpoint, is, supported, by, the, educational, attainment, of, countries, in, east, asia, for, instance, that, combine, strict, discipline, with, high, standards, of, education, it, s, not, clear, however, that, this, stereotypical, view, reflects, the, reality, of, east, asian, classrooms, or, that, the, educational, goals, in, these, countries, are, commensurable, with, those, in, western, countries, in, japan, for, example, although, average, attainment, on, standardized, tests, may, exceed, those, in, western, countries, classroom, discipline, and, behavior, is, highly, problematic, although, officially, schools, have, extremely, rigid, codes, of, behavior, in, practice, many, teachers, find, the, students, unmanageable, and, do, not, enforce, discipline, at, all, where, school, class, sizes, are, typically, 40, to, 50, students, maintaining, order, in, the, classroom, can, divert, the, teacher, from, instruction, leaving, little, opportunity, for, concentration, and, focus, on, what, is, being, taught, in, response, teachers, may, concentrate, their, attention, on, motivated, students, ignoring, attention, seeking, and, disruptive, students, the, result, of, this, is, that, motivated, students, facing, demanding, university, entrance, examinations, receive, disproportionate, resources, given, the, emphasis, on, attainment, of, university, places, administrators, and, governors, may, regard, this, policy, as, appropriate, sudbury, model, democratic, schools, claim, that, popularly, based, authority, can, maintain, order, more, effectively, than, dictatorial, authority, for, governments, and, schools, alike, they, also, claim, that, in, these, schools, the, preservation, of, public, order, is, easier, and, more, efficient, than, anywhere, else, primarily, because, rules, and, regulations, are, made, by, the, community, as, a, whole, thence, the, school, atmosphere, is, one, of, persuasion, and, negotiation, rather, than, confrontation, since, there, is, no, one, to, confront, sudbury, model, democratic, schools, proponents, argue, that, a, school, that, has, good, clear, laws, fairly, and, democratically, passed, by, the, entire, school, community, and, a, good, judicial, system, for, enforcing, these, laws, is, a, school, in, which, community, discipline, prevails, and, in, which, an, increasingly, sophisticated, concept, of, law, and, order, develops, against, other, schools, today, where, rules, are, arbitrary, authority, is, absolute, punishment, is, capricious, and, due, process, of, law, is, unknown, teachers, face, several, occupational, hazards, in, their, line, of, work, including, occupational, stress, which, can, negatively, impact, teachers, mental, and, physical, health, productivity, and, students, performance, stress, can, be, caused, by, organizational, change, relationships, with, students, fellow, teachers, and, administrative, personnel, working, environment, expectations, to, substitute, long, hours, with, a, heavy, workload, and, inspections, teachers, are, also, at, high, risk, for, occupational, burnout, a, 2000, study, found, that, 42, of, uk, teachers, experienced, occupational, stress, twice, the, figure, for, the, average, profession, a, 2012, study, found, that, teachers, experienced, double, the, rate, of, anxiety, depression, and, stress, than, average, workers, there, are, several, ways, to, mitigate, the, occupational, hazards, of, teaching, organizational, interventions, like, changing, teachers, schedules, providing, support, networks, and, mentoring, changing, the, work, environment, and, offering, promotions, and, bonuses, may, be, effective, in, helping, to, reduce, occupational, stress, among, teachers, individual, level, interventions, including, stress, management, training, and, counseling, are, also, used, to, relieve, occupational, stress, among, teachers, apart, from, this, teachers, are, often, not, given, sufficient, opportunities, for, professional, growth, or, promotions, this, leads, to, some, stagnancy, as, there, is, not, sufficient, interests, to, enter, the, profession, an, organisation, in, india, called, centre, for, teacher, accreditation, centa, is, working, to, reduce, this, hazard, by, trying, to, open, opportunities, for, teachers, in, india, there, are, many, similarities, and, differences, among, teachers, around, the, world, in, almost, all, countries, teachers, are, educated, in, a, university, or, college, governments, may, require, certification, by, a, recognized, body, before, they, can, teach, in, a, school, in, many, countries, elementary, school, education, certificate, is, earned, after, completion, of, high, school, the, high, school, student, follows, an, education, specialty, track, obtain, the, prerequisite, student, teaching, time, and, receive, a, special, diploma, to, begin, teaching, after, graduation, in, addition, to, certification, many, educational, institutions, especially, within, the, us, require, that, prospective, teachers, pass, a, background, check, and, psychiatric, evaluation, to, be, able, to, teach, in, classroom, this, is, not, always, the, case, with, adult, further, learning, institutions, but, is, fast, becoming, the, norm, in, many, countries, as, security, concerns, grow, international, schools, generally, follow, an, english, speaking, western, curriculum, and, are, aimed, at, expatriate, communities, education, in, australia, is, primarily, the, responsibility, of, the, individual, states, and, territories, generally, education, in, australia, follows, the, three, tier, model, which, includes, primary, education, primary, schools,
