conditions, under, which, it, could, be, prosecuted, article, 5, such, an, amendment, was, adopted, at, the, first, review, conference, of, the, icc, in, kampala, uganda, in, june, 2010, this, amendment, specified, that, the, icc, would, not, be, allowed, to, exercise, jurisdiction, of, the, crime, of, aggression, until, two, further, conditions, had, been, satisfied, 1, the, amendment, has, entered, into, force, for, 30, states, parties, and, 2, on, or, after, 1, january, 2017, the, assembly, of, states, parties, has, voted, in, favor, of, allowing, the, court, to, exercise, jurisdiction, on, 26, june, 2016, the, first, condition, was, satisfied, and, the, state, parties, voted, in, favor, of, allowing, the, court, to, exercise, jurisdiction, on, 14, december, 2017, the, court, s, jurisdiction, to, prosecute, crimes, of, aggression, was, accordingly, activated, on, 17, july, 2018, the, statute, as, amended, defines, the, crime, of, aggression, as, the, planning, preparation, initiation, or, execution, by, a, person, in, a, position, effectively, to, exercise, control, over, or, to, direct, the, political, or, military, action, of, a, state, of, an, act, of, aggression, which, by, its, character, gravity, and, scale, constitutes, a, manifest, violation, of, the, charter, of, the, united, nations, article, 8, bis, 1, the, statute, defines, an, act, of, aggression, as, the, use, of, armed, force, by, a, state, against, the, sovereignty, territorial, integrity, or, political, independence, of, another, state, or, in, any, other, manner, inconsistent, with, the, charter, of, the, united, nations, article, 8, bis, 2, the, article, also, contains, a, list, of, seven, acts, of, aggression, which, are, identical, to, those, in, united, nations, general, assembly, resolution, 3314, of, 1974, and, include, the, following, acts, when, committed, by, one, state, against, another, state, articles, 8, bis, 2, a, 8, bis, 2, g, article, 70,

influencing, a, witness, or, official, of, the, court, retaliating, against, an, official, of, the, court, and, soliciting, or, accepting, bribes, as, an, official, of, the, court, article, 70, the, rome, statute, requires, that, several, criteria, exist, in, a, particular, case, before, an, individual, can, be, prosecuted, by, the, court, the, statute, contains, three, jurisdictional, requirements, and, three, admissibility, requirements, all, criteria, must, be, met, for, a, case, to, proceed, the, three, jurisdictional, requirements, are, 1, subject, matter, jurisdiction, what, acts, constitute, crimes, 2, territorial, or, personal, jurisdiction, where, the, crimes, were, committed, or, who, committed, them, and, 3, temporal, jurisdiction, when, the, crimes, were, committed, for, an, individual, to, be, prosecuted, by, the, court, either, territorial, jurisdiction, or, personal, jurisdiction, must, exist, therefore, an, individual, can, only, be, prosecuted, if, he, or, she, has, either, 1, committed, a, crime, within, the, territorial, jurisdiction, of, the, court, or, 2, committed, a, crime, while, being, a, national, of, a, state, that, is, within, the, territorial, jurisdiction, of, the, court, the, territorial, jurisdiction, of, the, court, includes, the, territory, registered, vessels, and, registered, aircraft, of, states, which, have, either, 1, become, party, to, the, rome, statute, or, 2, accepted, the, court, s, jurisdiction, by, filing, a, declaration, with, the, court, article, 12, in, situations, that, are, referred, to, the, court, by, the, united, nations, security, council, the, territorial, jurisdiction, is, defined, by, the, security, council, which, may, be, more, expansive, than, the, court, s, normal, territorial, jurisdiction, article, 13, b, for, example, if, the, security, council, refers, a, situation, that, took, place, in, the, territory, of, a, state, that, has, both, not, become, party, to, the, rome, statute, and, not, lodged, a, declaration, with, the, court, the, court, will, still, be, able, to, prosecute, crimes, that, occurred, within, that, state, the, personal, jurisdiction, of, the, court, extends, to, all, natural, persons, who, commit, crimes, regardless, of, where, they, are, located, or, where, the, crimes, were, committed, as, long, as, those, individuals, are, nationals, of, either, 1, states, that, are, party, to, the, rome, statute, or, 2, states, that, have, accepted, the, court, s, jurisdiction, by, filing, a, declaration, with, the, court, article, 12, as, with, territorial, jurisdiction, the, personal, jurisdiction, can, be, expanded, by, the, security, council, if, it, refers, a, situation, to, the, court, article, 13, b, temporal, jurisdiction, is, the, time, period, over, which, the, court, can, exercise, its, powers, no, statute, of, limitations, applies, to, any, of, the, crimes, defined, in, the, statute, article, 29, this, is, not, completely, retroactive, individuals, can, only, be, prosecuted, for, crimes, that, took, place, on, or, after, 1, july, 2002, which, is, the, date, that, the, rome, statute, entered, into, force, article, 11, 1, if, a, state, became, party, to, the, statute, and, therefore, a, member, of, the, court, after, 1, july, 2002, then, the, court, cannot, exercise, jurisdiction, prior, to, the, membership, date, for, certain, cases, article, 11, 2, for, example, if, the, statute, entered, into, force, for, a, state, on, 1, january, 2003, the, court, could, only, exercise, temporal, jurisdiction, over, crimes, that, took, place, in, that, state, or, were, committed, by, a, national, of, that, state, on, or, after, 1, january, 2003, to, initiate, an, investigation, the, prosecutor, must, 1, have, a, reasonable, basis, to, believe, that, a, crime, within, the, jurisdiction, of, the, court, has, been, or, is, being, committed, 2, the, investigation, would, be, consistent, with, the, principle, of, complementarity, and, 3, the, investigation, serves, the, interests, of, justice, article, 53, 1, the, principle, of, complementarity, means, the, court, will, only, prosecute, an, individual, if, states, are, unwilling, or, unable, to, prosecute, therefore, if, legitimate, national, investigations, or, proceedings, into, crimes, have, taken, place, or, are, ongoing, the, court, will, not, initiate, proceedings, this, principle, applies, regardless, of, the, outcome, of, national, proceedings, article, 17, a, 17, c, even, if, an, investigation, is, closed, without, any, criminal, charges, being, filed, or, if, an, accused, person, is, acquitted, by, a, national, court, the, court, will, not, prosecute, an, individual, for, the, crime, in, question, so, long, as, it, is, satisfied, that, the, national, proceedings, were, legitimate, the, application, of, the, complementarity, principle, has, recently, come, under, theoretical, scrutiny, article, 17, a, 17, c, the, court, will, only, initiate, proceedings, if, a, crime, is, of, sufficient, gravity, to, justify, further, action, by, the, court, article, 17, d, the, prosecutor, will, initiate, an, investigation, unless, there, are, substantial, reasons, to, believe, that, an, investigation, would, not, serve, the, interests, of, justice, when, aking, into, account, the, gravity, of, the, crime, and, the, interests, of, victims, article, 53, 1, c, furthermore, even, if, an, investigation, has, been, initiated, and, there, are, substantial, facts, to, warrant, a, prosecution, and, no, other, admissibility, issues, the, prosecutor, must, determine, whether, a, prosecution, would, serve, the, interests, of, justice, taking, into, account, all, the, circumstances, including, the, gravity, of, the, crime, the, interests, of, victims, and, the, age, or, infirmity, of, the, alleged, perpetrator, and, his, or, her, role, in, the, alleged, crime, article, 53, 2, c, the, court, has, jurisdiction, over, natural, persons, article, 25, 1, a, person, who, commits, a, crime, within, the, jurisdiction, of, the, court, is, individually, responsible, and, liable, for, punishment, in, accordance, with, the, rome, statute, article, 25, 2, in, accordance, with, the, rome, statute, a, person, shall, be, criminally, responsible, and, liable, for, punishment, for, a, crime, within, the, jurisdiction, of, the, court, if, that, person, commits, such, a, crime, whether, as, an, individual, jointly, with, another, or, through, another, person, regardless, of, whether, that, other, person, is, criminally, responsible, article, 25, 3, a, orders, solicits, or, induces, the, commission, of, such, a, crime, which, in, fact, occurs, or, is, attempted, article, 25, 3, b, for, the, purpose, of, facilitating, the, commission, of, such, a, crime, aids, abets, or, otherwise, assists, in, its, commission, or, its, attempted, commission, including, providing, the, means, for, its, commission, article, 25, 3, c, in, any, other, way, contributes, to, the, commission, or, attempted, commission, of, such, a, crime, by, a, group, of, persons, acting, with, a, common, purpose, article, 25, 3, d, in, respect, of, the, crime, of, genocide, directly, and, publicly, incites, others, to, commit, genocide, article, 25, 3, e, attempts, to, commit, such, a, crime, by, taking, action, that, commences, its, execution, by, means, of, a, substantial, step, but, the, crime, does, not, occur, because, of, circumstances, independent, of, the, person, s, intentions, article, 25, 3, f, trials, are, conducted, under, a, hybrid, common, law, and, civil, law, judicial, system, but, it, has, been, argued, the, procedural, orientation, and, character, of, the, court, is, still, evolving, a, majority, of, the, three, judges, present, as, triers, of, fact, in, a, bench, trial, may, reach, a, decision, which, must, include, a, full, and, reasoned, statement, trials, are, supposed, to, be, public, but, proceedings, are, often, closed, and, such, exceptions, to, a, public, trial, have, not, been, enumerated, in, detail, in, camera, proceedings, are, allowed, for, protection, of, witnesses, or, defendants, as, well, as, for, confidential, or, sensitive, evidence, hearsay, and, other, indirect, evidence, is, not, generally, prohibited, but, it, has, been, argued, the, court, is, guided, by, hearsay, exceptions, which, are, prominent, in, common, law, systems, there, is, no, subpoena, or, other, means, to, compel, witnesses, to, come, before, the, court, although, the, court, has, some, power, to, compel, testimony, of, those, who, chose, to, come, before, it, such, as, fines, the, rome, statute, provides, that, all, persons, are, presumed, innocent, until, proven, guilty, beyond, reasonable, doubt, article, 66, and, establishes, certain, rights, of, the, accused, and, persons, during, investigations, these, include, the, right, to, be, fully, informed, of, the, charges, against, them, the, right, to, have, a, lawyer, appointed, free, of, charge, the, right, to, a, speedy, trial, and, the, right, to, examine, the, witnesses, against, them, to, ensure, equality, of, arms, between, defence, and, prosecution, teams, the, icc, has, established, an, independent, office, of, public, counsel, for, the, defence, opcd, to, provide, logistical, support, advice, and, information, to, defendants, and, their, counsel, the, opcd, also, helps, to, safeguard, the, rights, of, the, accused, during, the, initial, stages, of, an, investigation, thomas, lubanga, s, defence, team, said, they, were, given, a, smaller, budget, than, the, prosecutor, and, that, evidence, and, witness, statements, were, slow, to, arrive, one, of, the, great, innovations, of, the, statute, of, the, international, criminal, court, and, its, rules, of, procedure, and, evidence, is, the, series, of, rights, granted, to, victims, for, the, first, time, in, the, history, of, international, criminal, justice, victims, have, the, possibility, under, the, statute, to, present, their, views, and, observations, before, the, court, participation, before, the, court, may, occur, at, various, stages, of, proceedings, and, may, take, different, forms, although, it, will, be, up, to, the, judges, to, give, directions, as, to, the, timing, and, manner, of, participation, participation, in, the, court, s, proceedings, will, in, most, cases, take, place, through, a, legal, representative, and, will, be, conducted, in, a, manner, which, is, not, prejudicial, or, inconsistent, with, the, rights, of, the, accused, and, a, fair, and, impartial, trial, the, victim, based, provisions, within, the, rome, statute, provide, victims, with, the, opportunity, to, have, their, voices, heard, and, to, obtain, where, appropriate, some, form, of, reparation, for, their, suffering, it, is, the, aim, of, this, attempted, balance, between, retributive, and, restorative, justice, that, it, is, hoped, will, enable, the, icc, to, not, only, bring, criminals, to, justice, but, also, help, the, victims, themselves, obtain, some, form, of, justice, justice, for, victims, before, the, icc, comprises, both, procedural, and, substantive, justice, by, allowing, them, to, participate, and, present, their, views, and, interests, so, that, they, can, help, to, shape, truth, justice, and, reparations, outcomes, of, the, court, article, 43, 6, establishes, a, victims, and, witnesses, unit, to, provide, protective, measures, and, security, arrangements, counseling, and, other, appropriate, assistance, for, witnesses, victims, who, appear, before, the, court, and, others, who, are, at, risk, on, account, of, testimony, given, by, such, witnesses, article, 43, 6, article, 68, sets, out, procedures, for, the, protection, of, the, victims, and, witnesses, and, their, participation, in, the, proceedings, article, 68, the, court, has, also, established, an, office, of, public, counsel, for, victims, to, provide, support, and, assistance, to, victims, and, their, legal, representatives, victims, before, the, international, criminal, court, can, also, claim, reparations, under, article, 75, of, the, rome, statute, reparations, can, only, be, claimed, when, a, defendant, is, convicted, and, at, the, discretion, of, the, court, s, judges, so, far, the, court, has, ordered, reparations, against, thomas, lubanga, reparations, can, include, compensation, restitution, and, rehabilitation, but, other, forms, of, reparations, may, be, appropriate, for, individual, collective, or, community, victims, article, 79, of, the, rome, statute, establishes, a, trust, fund, to, provide, assistance, before, a, reparation, order, to, victims, in, a, situation, or, to, support, reparations, to, victims, and, their, families, if, the, convicted, person, has, no, money, one, of, the, principles, of, international, law, is, that, a, treaty, does, not, create, either, obligations, or, rights, for, third, states, without, their, consent, and, this, is, also, enshrined, in, the, 1969, vienna, convention, on, the, law, of, treaties, the, cooperation, of, the, non, party, states, with, the, icc, is, envisioned, by, the, rome, statute, of, the, international, criminal, court, to, be, of, voluntary, nature, article, 87, 5, a, states, not, acceded, to, the, rome, statute, might, still, be, subject, to, an, obligation, to, cooperate, with, icc, in, certain, cases, when, a, case, is, referred, to, the, icc, by, the, un, security, council, all, un, member, states, are, obliged, to, cooperate, since, its, decisions, are, binding, for, all, of, them, also, there, is, an, obligation, to, respect, and, ensure, respect, for, international, humanitarian, law, which, stems, from, the, geneva, conventions, and, additional, protocol, i, which, reflects, the, absolute, nature, of, international, humanitarian, law, in, relation, to, cooperation, in, investigation, and, evidence, gathering, it, is, implied, from, the, rome, statute, article, 99, that, the, consent, of, a, non, party, state, is, a, prerequisite, for, icc, prosecutor, to, conduct, an, investigation, within, its, territory, and, it, seems, that, it, is, even, more, necessary, for, him, to, observe, any, reasonable, conditions, raised, by, that, state, since, such, restrictions, exist, for, states, party, to, the, statute, taking, into, account, the, experience, of, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, which, worked, with, the, principle, of, the, primacy, instead, of, complementarity, in, relation, to, cooperation, some, scholars, have, expressed, their, pessimism, as, to, the, possibility, of, icc, to, obtain, cooperation, of, non, party, states, as, for, the, actions, that, icc, can, take, toward, non, party, states, that, do, not, cooperate, the, rome, statute, stipulates, that, the, court, may, inform, the, assembly, of, states, parties, or, security, council, when, the, matter, was, referred, by, it, when, non, party, state, refuses, to, cooperate, after, it, has, entered, into, an, ad, hoc, arrangement, or, an, agreement, with, the, court, article, 87, 5, it, is, unclear, to, what, extent, the, icc, is, compatible, with, reconciliation, processes, that, grant, amnesty, to, human, rights, abusers, as, part, of, agreements, to, end, conflict, article, 16, of, the, rome, statute, allows, the, security, council, to, prevent, the, court, from, investigating, or, prosecuting, a, case, article, 16, and, article, 53, allows, the, prosecutor, the, discretion, not, to, initiate, an, investigation, if, he, or, she, believes, that, an, investigation, would, not, serve, the, interests, of, justice, article, 53, former, icc, president, philippe, kirsch, has, said, that, some, limited, amnesties, may, be, compatible, with, a, country, s, obligations, genuinely, to, investigate, or, prosecute, under, the, statute, it, is, sometimes, argued, that, amnesties, are, necessary, to, allow, the, peaceful, transfer, of, power, from, abusive, regimes, by, denying, states, the, right, to, offer, amnesty, to, human, rights, abusers, the, international, criminal, court, may, make, it, more, difficult, to, negotiate, an, end, to, conflict, and, a, transition, to, democracy, for, example, the, outstanding, arrest, warrants, for, four, leaders, of, the, lord, s, resistance, army, are, regarded, by, some, as, an, obstacle, to, ending, the, insurgency, in, uganda, czech, politician, marek, benda, argues, that, the, icc, as, a, deterrent, will, in, our, view, only, mean, the, worst, dictators, will, try, to, retain, power, at, all, costs, the, united, nations, and, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, maintain, that, granting, amnesty, to, those, accused, of, war, crimes, and, other, serious, crimes, is, a, violation, of, international, law, the, official, seat, of, the, court, is, in, the, hague, netherlands, but, its, proceedings, may, take, place, anywhere, article, 3, the, court, moved, into, its, first, permanent, premises, in, the,

arrangement, gives, the, icc, some, of, the, advantages, inhering, in, the, organs, of, the, united, nations, such, as, using, the, enforcement, powers, of, the, security, council, but, it, also, creates, a, risk, of, being, tainted, with, the, political, controversies, of, the, security, council, the, court, cooperates, with, the, un, in, many, different, areas, including, the, exchange, of, information, and, logistical, support, the, court, reports, to, the, un, each, year, on, its, activities, and, some, meetings, of, the, assembly, of, states, parties, are, held, at, un, facilities, the, relationship, between, the, court, and, the, un, is, governed, by, a, relationship, agreement, between, the, international, criminal, court, and, the, united, nations, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, international, human, rights, and, humanitarian, nongovernmental, organizations, or, ngos, began, to, proliferate, at, exponential, rates, concurrently, the, quest, to, find, a, way, to, punish, international, crimes, shifted, from, being, the, exclusive, responsibility, of, legal, experts, to, being, shared, with, international, human, rights, activism, ngos, helped, birth, the, icc, through, advocacy, and, championing, for, the, prosecution, of, perpetrators, of, crimes, against, humanity, ngos, closely, monitor, the, organization, s, declarations, and, actions, ensuring, that, the, work, that, is, being, executed, on, behalf, of, the, icc, is, fulfilling, its, objectives, and, responsibilities, to, civil, society, according, to, benjamin, schiff, from, the, statute, conference, onward, the, relationship, between, the, icc, and, the, ngos, has, probably, been, closer, more, consistent, and, more, vital, to, the, court, than, have, analogous, relations, between, ngos, and, any, other, international, organization, there, are, a, number, of, ngos, working, on, a, variety, of, issues, related, to, the, icc, the, ngo, coalition, for, the, international, criminal, court, has, served, as, a, sort, of, umbrella, for, ngos, to, coordinate, with, each, other, on, similar, objectives, related, to, the, icc, the, cicc, has, 2, 500, member, organizations, in, 150, countries, the, original, steering, committee, included, representatives, from, the, world, federalist, movement, the, international, commission, of, jurists, amnesty, international, the, lawyers, committee, for, human, rights, human, rights, watch, parliamentarians, for, global, action, and, no, peace, without, justice, today, many, of, the, ngos, with, which, the, icc, cooperates, are, members, of, the, cicc, these, organizations, come, from, a, range, of, backgrounds, spanning, from, major, international, ngos, such, as, human, rights, watch, and, amnesty, international, to, smaller, more, local, organizations, focused, on, peace, and, justice, missions, many, work, closely, with, states, such, as, the, international, criminal, law, network, founded, and, predominantly, funded, by, the, hague, municipality, and, the, dutch, ministries, of, defense, and, foreign, affairs, the, cicc, also, claims, organizations, that, are, themselves, federations, such, as, the, international, federation, of, human, rights, leagues, fidh, cicc, members, subscribe, to, three, principles, that, permit, them, to, work, under, the, umbrella, of, the, cicc, so, long, as, their, objectives, match, them, the, ngos, that, work, under, the, cicc, do, not, normally, pursue, agendas, exclusive, to, the, work, of, the, court, rather, they, may, work, for, broader, causes, such, as, general, human, rights, issues, victims, rights, gender, rights, rule, of, law, conflict, mediation, and, peace, the, cicc, coordinates, their, efforts, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, ngos, contributions, to, the, court, and, to, pool, their, influence, on, major, common, issues, from, the, icc, side, it, has, been, useful, to, have, the, cicc, channel, ngo, contacts, with, the, court, so, that, its, officials, do, not, have, to, interact, individually, with, thousands, of, separate, organizations, ngos, have, been, crucial, to, the, evolution, of, the, icc, as, they, assisted, in, the, creation, of, the, normative, climate, that, urged, states, to, seriously, consider, the, court, s, formation, their, legal, experts, helped, shape, the, statute, while, their, lobbying, efforts, built, support, for, it, they, advocate, statute, ratification, globally, and, work, at, expert, and, political, levels, within, member, states, for, passage, of, necessary, domestic, legislation, ngos, are, greatly, represented, at, meetings, for, the, assembly, of, states, parties, and, they, use, the, asp, meetings, to, press, for, decisions, promoting, their, priorities, many, of, these, ngos, have, reasonable, access, to, important, officials, at, the, icc, because, of, their, involvement, during, the, statute, process, they, are, engaged, in, monitoring, commenting, upon, and, assisting, in, the, icc, s, activities, the, icc, often, depends, on, ngos, to, interact, with, local, populations, the, registry, public, information, office, personnel, and, victims, participation, and, reparations, section, officials, hold, seminars, for, local, leaders, professionals, and, the, media, to, spread, the, word, about, the, court, these, are, the, kinds, of, events, that, are, often, hosted, or, organized, by, local, ngos, because, there, can, be, challenges, with, determining, which, of, these, ngos, are, legitimate, cicc, regional, representatives, often, have, the, ability, to, help, screen, and, identify, trustworthy, organizations, ngos, are, also, sources, of, criticism, exhortation, and, pressure, upon, the, icc, the, icc, heavily, depends, on, ngos, for, its, operations, although, ngos, and, states, cannot, directly, impact, the, judicial, nucleus, of, the, organization, they, can, impart, information, on, crimes, can, help, locate, victims, and, witnesses, and, can, promote, and, organize, victim, participation, ngos, outwardly, comment, on, the, court, s, operations, push, for, expansion, of, its, activities, especially, in, the, new, justice, areas, of, outreach, in, conflict, areas, in, victims, participation, and, reparations, and, in, upholding, due, process, standards, and, defense, equality, of, arms, and, so, implicitly, set, an, agenda, for, the, future, evolution, of, the, icc, the, relatively, uninterrupted, progression, of, ngo, involvement, with, the, icc, may, mean, that, ngos, have, become, repositories, of, more, institutional, historical, knowledge, about, the, icc, than, its, national, representatives, and, have, greater, expertise, than, some, of, the, organization, s, employees, themselves, while, ngos, look, to, mold, the, icc, to, satisfy, the, interests, and, priorities, that, they, have, worked, for, since, the, early, 1990s, they, unavoidably, press, against, the, limits, imposed, upon, the, icc, by, the, states, that, are, members, of, the, organization, ngos, can, pursue, their, own, mandates, irrespective, of, whether, they, are, compatible, with, those, of, other, ngos, while, the, icc, must, respond, to, the, complexities, of, its, own, mandate, as, well, as, those, of, the, states, and, ngos, another, issue, has, been, that, ngos, possess, exaggerated, senses, of, their, ownership, over, the, organization, and, having, been, vital, to, and, successful, in, promoting, the, court, were, not, managing, to, redefine, their, roles, to, permit, the, court, its, necessary, independence, additionally, because, there, does, exist, such, a, gap, between, the, large, human, rights, organizations, and, the, smaller, peace, oriented, organizations, it, is, difficult, for, icc, officials, to, manage, and, gratify, all, of, their, ngos, icc, officials, recognize, that, the, ngos, pursue, their, own, agendas, and, that, they, will, seek, to, pressure, the, icc, in, the, direction, of, their, own, priorities, rather, than, necessarily, understanding, or, being, fully, sympathetic, to, the, myriad, constraints, and, pressures, under, which, the, court, operates, both, the, icc, and, the, ngo, community, avoid, criticizing, each, other, publicly, or, vehemently, although, ngos, have, released, advisory, and, cautionary, messages, regarding, the, icc, they, avoid, taking, stances, that, could, potentially, give, the, court, s, adversaries, particularly, the, u, s, more, motive, to, berate, the, organization, in, october, 2016, after, repeated, claims, that, the, court, was, biased, against, african, states, burundi, south, africa, and, the, gambia, announced, their, withdrawals, from, the, rome, statute, following, gambia, s, presidential, election, later, that, year, which, ended, the, long, rule, of, yahya, jammeh, gambia, rescinded, its, withdrawal, notification, a, decision, by, the, high, court, of, south, africa, in, early, 2017, ruled, that, the, attempted, withdrawal, was, unconstitutional, as, it, had, not, been, agreed, by, parliament, prompting, the, south, african, government, to, inform, the, un, that, it, was, revoking, its, decision, to, withdraw, the, icc, has, been, accused, of, bias, and, as, being, a, tool, of, western, imperialism, only, punishing, leaders, from, small, weak, states, while, ignoring, crimes, committed, by, richer, and, more, powerful, states, this, sentiment, has, been, expressed, particularly, by, african, leaders, due, to, an, alleged, disproportionate, focus, of, the, court, on, africa, while, it, claims, to, have, a, global, mandate, until, january, 2016, all, nine, situations, which, the, icc, had, been, investigating, were, in, african, countries, african, critics, have, suggested, the, icc, is, acting, as, a, neo, colonial, force, seeking, to, further, empower, western, political, and, extractive, interests, in, africa, scholar, awol, allo, has, described, the, court, s, underlying, problem, that, has, led, to, these, challenges, with, africa, as, not, overt, racism, but, eurocentrism, another, analysis, suggests, that, african, states, are, motivated, by, concerns, over, africa, s, place, in, world, order, the, problem, is, the, sovereign, inequality, displayed, by, the, icc, prosecutor, s, focus, the, prosecution, of, kenyan, deputy, president, william, ruto, and, president, uhuru, kenyatta, both, charged, before, coming, into, office, led, to, the, kenyan, parliament, passing, a, motion, calling, for, kenya, s, withdrawal, from, the, icc, and, the, country, called, on, the, other, 33, african, states, party, to, the, icc, to, withdraw, their, support, an, issue, which, was, discussed, at, a, special, african, union, au, summit, in, october, 2013, though, the, icc, has, denied, the, charge, of, disproportionately, targeting, african, leaders, and, claims, to, stand, up, for, victims, wherever, they, may, be, kenya, was, not, alone, in, criticising, the, icc, sudanese, president, omar, al, bashir, visited, kenya, south, africa, china, nigeria, saudi, arabia, united, arab, emirates, egypt, ethiopia, qatar, and, several, other, countries, despite, an, outstanding, icc, warrant, for, his, arrest, but, was, not, arrested, he, said, that, the, charges, against, him, are, exaggerated, and, that, the, icc, was, a, part, of, a, western, plot, against, him, ivory, coast, s, government, opted, not, to, transfer, former, first, lady, simone, gbagbo, to, the, court, but, to, instead, try, her, at, home, rwanda, s,

general, assembly, at, the, general, debate, of, the, sixty, eighth, session, of, the, united, nations, general, assembly, the, manner, in, which, the, icc, has, been, operating, has, left, a, very, bad, impression, in, africa, it, is, totally, unacceptable, south, african, president, jacob, zuma, said, the, perceptions, of, the, icc, as, unreasonable, led, to, the, calling, of, the, special, au, summit, on, 13, october, 2015, botswana, is, a, notable, supporter, of, the, icc, in, africa, at, the, summit, the, au, did, not, endorse, the, proposal, for, a, collective, withdrawal, from, the, icc, due, to, lack, of, support, for, the, idea, the, summit, concluded, that, serving, heads, of, state, should, not, be, put, on, trial, and, that, the, kenyan, cases, should, be, deferred,

would, work, with, the, us, congress, on, potential, sanctions, against, the, icc, prior, to, the, issuing, of, the, icc, s, arrest, warrant, for, netanyahu, a, group, of, us, republican, senators, sent, a, letter, to, icc, prosecutor, karim, ahmad, khan, that, contained, the, warning, target, israel, and, we, will, target, you, the, house, passed, a, bill, to, sanction, icc, officials, on, june, 4, 2024, the, united, states, department, of, state, argues, that, there, are, insufficient, checks, and, balances, on, the, authority, of, the, icc, prosecutor, and, judges, and, insufficient, protection, against, politicized, prosecutions, or, other, abuses, the, current, law, in, the, united, states, on, the, icc, is, the, american, service, members, protection, act, aspa, 116, stat, 820, the, aspa, authorizes, the, president, of, the, united, states, to, use, all, means, necessary, and, appropriate, to, bring, about, the, release, of, any, u, s, or, allied, personnel, being, detained, or, imprisoned, by, on, behalf, of, or, at, the, request, of, the, international, criminal, court, this, authorization, has, led, the, act, to, be, nicknamed, the, hague, invasion, act, because, the, freeing, of, u, s, citizens, by, force, might, be, possible, only, through, military, action, on, 10, september, 2018, john, r, bolton, in, his, first, major, address, as, u, s, national, security, advisor, reiterated, that, the, icc, lacks, checks, and, balances, exercises, jurisdiction, over, crimes, that, have, disputed, and, ambiguous, definitions, and, has, failed, to, deter, and, punish, atrocity, crimes, the, icc, bolton, said, was, superfluous, given, that, domestic, judicial, systems, already, hold, american, citizens, to, the, highest, legal, and, ethical, standards, he, added, that, the, u, s, would, do, everything, to, protect, our, citizens, should, the, icc, attempt, to, prosecute, u, s, servicemen, over, alleged, detainee, abuse, in, afghanistan, in, that, event, icc, judges, and, prosecutors, would, be, barred, from, entering, the, u, s, their, funds, in, the, u, s, would, be, sanctioned, and, the, u, s, will, prosecute, them, in, the, u, s, criminal, system, we, will, do, the, same, for, any, company, or, state, that, assists, an, icc, investigation, of, americans, bolton, said, he, also, criticized, palestinian, efforts, to, bring, israel, before, the, icc, over, allegations, of, human, rights, abuses, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, concerning, the, independent, office, of, public, counsel, for, the, defence, opcd, thomas, lubanga, s, defence, team, say, they, were, given, a, smaller, budget, than, the, prosecutor, and, that, evidence, and, witness, statements, were, slow, to, arrive, the, international, criminal, court, is, often, critiqued, for, being, selective, or, imperialistic, or, reflecting, the, geopolitical, interests, of, powerful, states, says, sarah, knuckey, a, columbia, law, professor, while, many, western, countries, supported, the, arrest, warrant, for, russian, president, putin, how, they, respond, to, the, warrant, against, israel, s, netanyahu, will, be, a, test, of, the, genuineness, of, their, commitment, to, international, justice, for, all, she, continued, human, rights, watch, hrw, reported, that, the, icc, s, prosecutor, team, takes, no, account, of, the, roles, played, by, the, government, in, the, conflict, of, uganda, rwanda, or, congo, this, led, to, a, flawed, investigation, because, the, icc, did, not, reach, the, conclusion, of, its, verdict, after, considering, the, governments, position, and, actions, in, the, conflict, research, indicates, that, prosecutions, of, leaders, who, are, culpable, of, international, crimes, in, the, icc, makes, them, less, likely, to, peacefully, step, down, which, can, prolong, conflicts, and, incentivize, them, to, make, continued, use, of, mass, violence, it, is, also, argued, that, justice, is, a, means, to, peace, as, a, result, the, icc, has, been, used, as, a, means, of, intervention, in, ongoing, conflicts, with, the, expectation, that, the, indictments, arrests, and, trials, of, elite, perpetrators, have, deterrence, and, preventive, effects, for, atrocity, crimes, despite, these, legitimate, intentions, and, great, expectations, there, is, little, evidence, of, the, efficacy, of, justice, as, a, means, to, peace, that, the, icc, cannot, mount, successful, cases, without, state, cooperation, is, problematic, for, several, reasons, it, means, that, the, icc, acts, inconsistently, in, its, selection, of, cases, is, prevented, from, taking, on, hard, cases, and, loses, legitimacy, it, also, gives, the, icc, less, deterrent, value, as, potential, perpetrators, of, war, crimes, know, that, they, can, avoid, icc, judgment, by, taking, over, government, and, refusing, to, cooperate, the, fundamental, principle, of, complementarity, of, the, icc, rome, statute, is, often, taken, for, granted, in, the, legal, analysis, of, international, criminal, law, and, its, jurisprudence, initially, the, thorny, issue, of, the, actual, application, of, the, complementarity, principle, arose, in, 2008, when, william, schabas, published, his, influential, paper, no, substantive, research, was, made, by, other, scholars, on, this, issue, for, quite, some, time, in, june, 2017, victor, tsilonis, advanced, the, same, criticism, which, is, reinforced, by, events, practices, of, the, office, of, the, prosecutor, and, icc, cases, in, the, essays, in, honour, of, nestor, courakis, his, paper, essentially, argues, that, the, l, senussi, case, arguably, is, the, first, instance, of, the, complementarity, principle, s, actual, implementation, eleven, whole, years, after, the, ratification, of, the, rome, statute, of, the, international, criminal, court, on, the, other, hand, in, 2017, chief, prosecutor, fatou, bensouda, invoked, the, principle, of, complementarity, in, the, situation, between, russia, and, georgia, in, the, ossetia, region, moreover, following, the, threats, of, certain, african, states, initially, burundi, gambia, and, south, africa, to, withdraw, their, ratifications, bensouda, again, referred, to, the, principle, of, complementarity, as, a, core, principle, of, icc, s, jurisdiction, and, has, more, extensively, focused, on, the, principle, s, application, on, the, latest, office, of, the, prosecutor, s, report, on, preliminary, examination, activities, 2016, some, advocates, have, suggested, that, the, icc, go, beyond, complementarity, and, systematically, support, national, capacity, for, prosecutions, they, argue, that, national, prosecutions, where, possible, are, more, cost, effective, preferable, to, victims, and, more, sustainable, there, is, a, debate, on, whether, the, icc, should, have, jurisdiction, over, corporations, that, violate, international, law, supporters, argue, that, corporations, can, and, do, commit, human, rights, violations, such, as, war, crimes, linked, to, raw, materials, in, conflict, zones, critics, argue, that, prosecuting, corporations, would, compromise, the, principle, of, complementarity, that, it, would, give, corporations, excessive, power, under, international, law, or, that, it, would, compromise, voluntary, initiatives, by, companies, john, ruggie, has, argued, that, jurisdiction, of, corporations, under, international, law, should, be, limited, to, international, crimes, while, nicol, s, carrillo, santarelli, of, la, sabana, university, argues, that, it, should, cover, all, human, rights, violations, despite, its, lack, of, jurisdiction, the, icc, announced, in, 2016, that, it, would, prioritize, criminal, cases, linked, to, land, grabbing, illegal, resource, extraction, or, environmental, degradation, caused, by, corporate, activity, the, proposed, crime, of, ecocide, would, have, jurisdiction, over, corporations, as, well, as, governments, supporters, of, criminalizing, ecocide, argue, that, it, would, shift, the, icc, s, priorities, away, from, africa, since, most, environmental, degradation, is, caused, by, states, and, corporations, in, the, global, north
