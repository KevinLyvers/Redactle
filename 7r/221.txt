keynes, john, milton, vladimir, nabokov, jawaharlal, nehru, isaac, newton, sylvia, plath, bertrand, russell, alan, turing, ludwig, wittgenstein, and, others, prior, to, the, founding, of, the, university, of, cambridge, in, 1209, cambridge, and, the, area, surrounding, it, already, had, developed, a, scholarly, and, ecclesiastical, reputation, due, largely, to, the, intellectual, reputation, and, academic, contributions, of, monks, from, the, nearby, bishopric, church, in, ely, the, founding, of, the, university, of, cambridge, however, was, inspired, largely, by, an, incident, at, the, university, of, oxford, during, which, three, oxford, scholars, as, an, administration, of, justice, in, the, death, of, a, local, oxford, area, woman, were, hanged, by, town, authorities, without, first, consulting, ecclesiastical, authorities, who, traditionally, would, be, inclined, to, pardon, scholars, in, such, cases, but, during, this, time, oxford, s, town, authorities, were, in, conflict, with, king, john, fearing, more, violence, from, oxford, townsfolk, university, of, oxford, scholars, began, leaving, oxford, for, more, hospitable, cities, including, paris, reading, and, cambridge, enough, scholars, ultimately, took, residence, in, cambridge, to, form, along, with, the, many, scholars, already, there, the, nucleus, for, the, new, university, s, formation, by, 1225, a, chancellor, of, the, university, was, appointed, and, writs, issued, by, king, henry, iii, in, 1231, established, that, rents, in, cambridge, were, to, be, set, secundum, consuetudinem, universitatis, according, to, the, custom, of, the, university, and, established, a, panel, of, two, masters, and, two, townsmen, to, determine, these, a, letter, from, pope, gregory, ix, two, years, later, to, the, chancellor, and, the, guild, of, scholars, granted, the, new, university, ius, non, trahi, extra, or, the, right, not, to, be, drawn, out, for, three, years, meaning, its, members, could, not, be, summoned, to, a, court, outside, of, the, diocese, of, ely, after, cambridge, was, described, as, a, studium, generale, in, a, letter, from, pope, nicholas, iv, in, 1290, and, confirmed, as, such, by, pope, john, xxii, s, 1318, papal, bull, it, became, common, for, researchers, from, other, european, medieval, universities, to, visit, cambridge, to, study, or, give, lecture, courses, the, 31, colleges, of, the, present, day, university, of, cambridge, were, originally, an, incidental, feature, of, the, university, no, college, within, the, university, of, cambridge, is, as, old, as, the, university, itself, the, colleges, within, the, university, were, initially, endowed, fellowships, of, scholars, there, were, also, institutions, without, endowments, called, hostels, which, were, gradually, absorbed, by, the, colleges, over, the, centuries, and, they, have, left, some, traces, including, the, naming, of, garret, hostel, lane, and, garret, hostel, bridge, a, street, and, bridge, in, cambridge, the, university, of, cambridge, s, first, college, peterhouse, was, founded, in, 1284, by, hugh, de, balsham, the, bishop, of, ely, multiple, additional, colleges, were, founded, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, and, colleges, continued, to, be, established, during, modern, times, though, there, was, a, 204, year, gap, between, the, founding, of, sidney, sussex, in, 1596, and, that, of, downing, in, 1800, the, most, recent, college, to, be, established, is, robinson, which, was, built, in, the, late, 1970s, most, recently, in, march, 2010, homerton, college, achieved, full, university, college, status, making, it, technically, the, university, s, newest, full, college, in, medieval, times, many, colleges, were, founded, so, that, their, members, could, pray, for, the, souls, of, the, founders, university, of, cambridge, colleges, were, often, associated, with, chapels, or, abbeys, the, colleges, focus, began, to, shift, in, 1536, however, with, the, dissolution, of, the, monasteries, and, henry, viii, s, order, that, the, university, disband, the, canon, law, that, governed, the, university, s, faculty, and, stop, teaching, scholastic, philosophy, in, response, colleges, changed, their, curricula, from, canon, law, to, classics, the, bible, and, mathematics, nearly, a, century, later, the, university, found, itself, at, the, centre, of, a, protestant, schism, many, nobles, intellectuals, and, also, commoners, saw, the, church, of, england, as, too, similar, to, the, catholic, church, and, felt, that, it, was, being, used, by, the, crown, to, usurp, the, counties, rightful, powers, east, anglia, emerged, as, the, centre, of, what, ultimately, became, the, puritan, movement, in, cambridge, the, puritan, movement, was, particularly, strong, at, emmanuel, st, catharine, hall, sidney, sussex, and, christ, s, these, colleges, produced, many, nonconformist, graduates, who, greatly, influenced, by, social, position, or, preaching, some, 20, 000, puritans, who, ultimately, left, england, for, new, england, and, especially, massachusetts, bay, colony, during, the, great, migration, decade, of, the, 1630s, settling, in, the, colonial, era, colony, of, virginia, and, other, fledgling, american, colonies, the, university, quickly, established, itself, as, a, global, leader, in, the, study, of, mathematics, the, university, s, examination, in, mathematics, known, as, the, mathematical, tripos, was, initially, compulsory, for, all, undergraduates, studying, for, the, bachelor, of, arts, degree, the, most, common, degree, first, offered, at, cambridge, from, the, time, of, isaac, newton, in, the, late, 17th, century, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, university, maintained, an, especially, strong, emphasis, on, applied, mathematics, and, especially, mathematical, physics, students, awarded, first, class, honours, after, completing, the, mathematics, tripos, exam, are, called, wranglers, and, the, top, student, among, them, is, known, as, the, senior, wrangler, a, position, that, has, been, described, as, the, greatest, intellectual, achievement, attainable, in, britain, the, cambridge, mathematical, tripos, is, highly, competitive, and, has, helped, produce, some, of, the, most, famous, names, in, british, science, including, james, clerk, maxwell, lord, kelvin, and, lord, rayleigh, however, some, famous, students, such, as, g, h, hardy, disliked, the, tripos, system, feeling, that, students, were, becoming, too, focused, on, accumulating, high, exam, marks, at, the, expense, of, the, subject, itself, pure, mathematics, at, the, university, of, cambridge, in, the, 19th, century, achieved, great, things, though, it, largely, missed, out, on, substantial, developments, in, french, and, german, mathematics, by, the, early, 20th, century, however, pure, mathematical, research, at, cambridge, reached, the, highest, international, standard, thanks, largely, to, g, h, hardy, and, his, collaborators, j, e, littlewood, and, srinivasa, ramanujan, w, v, d, hodge, and, others, helped, establish, cambridge, as, a, global, leader, in, geometry, in, the, 1930s, the, cambridge, university, act, 1856, formalised, the, university, s, organisational, structure, and, introduced, the, study, of, many, new, subjects, including, theology, history, and, modern, languages, resources, necessary, for, new, courses, in, the, arts, architecture, and, archaeology, were, donated, by, viscount, fitzwilliam, of, trinity, college, who, also, founded, fitzwilliam, museum, in, 1816, in, 1847, prince, albert, was, elected, the, university, s, chancellor, in, a, close, contest, with, the, earl, of, powis, as, chancellor, albert, reformed, university, curricula, beyond, its, initial, focus, on, mathematics, and, classics, adding, modern, era, history, and, the, natural, sciences, between, 1896, and, 1902, downing, college, sold, part, of, its, land, to, permit, the, construction, of, downing, site, the, university, s, grouping, of, scientific, laboratories, for, the, study, of, anatomy, genetics, and, earth, sciences, during, this, period, the, new, museums, site, was, erected, including, the, cavendish, laboratory, which, has, since, moved, to, west, cambridge, and, other, departments, for, chemistry, and, medicine, the, university, of, cambridge, began, to, award, phd, degrees, in, the, first, third, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, cambridge, phd, in, mathematics, was, awarded, in, 1924, the, university, contributed, significantly, to, the, allies, forces, in, world, war, i, with, 13, 878, members, of, the, university, serving, and, 2, 470, being, killed, in, action, during, the, war, teaching, and, the, fees, it, earned, nearly, came, to, a, halt, during, world, war, i, and, severe, financial, difficulties, followed, as, a, result, the, university, received, its, first, systematic, state, support, in, 1919, and, a, royal, commission, was, appointed, in, 1920, to, recommend, that, the, university, but, not, its, colleges, begin, receiving, an, annual, grant, following, world, war, ii, the, university, experienced, a, rapid, expansion, in, applications, and, enrollment, partly, due, to, the, success, and, popularity, gained, by, many, cambridge, scientists, this, was, not, without, controversies, however, for, example, cambridge, researchers, were, accused, in, 2023, of, helping, to, develop, weapon, systems, for, iran, the, university, of, cambridge, was, one, of, only, two, universities, to, hold, parliamentary, seats, in, the, parliament, of, england, and, was, later, one, of, 19, represented, in, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, the, constituency, was, created, by, a, royal, charter, of, 1603, and, returned, two, members, of, parliament, until, 1950, when, it, was, abolished, by, the, representation, of, the, people, act, 1948, the, constituency, was, not, a, geographical, area, rather, its, electorate, consisted, of, university, graduates, before, 1918, the, franchise, was, restricted, to, male, graduates, with, a, doctorate, or, ma, degree, for, the, first, several, centuries, of, its, existence, as, was, the, case, broadly, in, england, and, the, world, the, university, of, cambridge, was, only, open, to, male, students, the, first, colleges, established, for, women, were, girton, college, founded, by, emily, davies, in, 1869, newnham, college, founded, by, anne, clough, and, henry, sidgwick, in, 1872, hughes, hall, founded, in, 1885, by, elizabeth, phillips, hughes, as, the, cambridge, teaching, college, for, women, murray, edwards, college, founded, in, 1954, by, rosemary, murray, as, new, hall, and, lucy, cavendish, college, founded, in, 1965, prior, to, ultimately, being, permitted, admission, to, the, university, in, 1948, female, students, were, granted, the, right, to, take, university, of, cambridge, exams, beginning, in, the, late, 19th, century, women, were, also, allowed, to, study, courses, take, examinations, and, have, prior, exam, results, recorded, retroactively, dating, back, to, 1881, for, a, brief, period, after, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, this, allowed, the, steamboat, ladies, to, receive, ad, eundem, degrees, from, the, university, of, dublin, in, 1998, a, special, graduation, ceremony, was, held, in, which, the, women, who, attended, cambridge, before, admission, was, allowed, in, 1948, were, finally, conferred, their, degrees, beginning, in, 1921, women, were, awarded, diplomas, that, conferred, the, title, associated, with, the, bachelor, of, arts, degree, but, since, women, were, not, yet, admitted, to, the, bachelor, of, arts, degree, program, they, were, excluded, from, the, university, s, governance, structure, since, university, of, cambridge, students, must, belong, to, a, college, and, since, established, colleges, remained, closed, to, women, women, found, admissions, restricted, to, the, few, university, colleges, that, had, been, established, only, for, them, darwin, college, the, first, graduate, college, of, the, university, matriculated, both, male, and, female, students, from, its, inception, in, 1964, and, elected, a, mixed, fellowship, undergraduate, colleges, starting, with, churchill, clare, and, king, s, colleges, began, admitting, women, between, 1972, and, 1988, among, women, s, colleges, at, the, university, girton, began, admitting, male, students, in, 1979, and, lucy, cavendish, began, admitting, men, in, 2021, but, the, other, female, only, colleges, have, remained, female, only, colleges, as, of, 2023, as, a, result, of, st, hilda, s, college, oxford, ending, its, ban, on, male, students, in, 2008, cambridge, is, now, the, only, remaining, university, in, the, united, kingdom, with, female, only, colleges, the, two, female, only, colleges, at, the, university, are, newnham, and, murray, edwards, as, of, the, 2019, 2020, academic, year, the, university, s, male, to, female, enrollment, including, post, graduates, was, nearly, balanced, with, its, total, student, population, being, 53, male, and, 47, female, in, 2018, and, later, years, the, university, has, come, under, some, criticism, and, faced, legal, challenges, over, alleged, sexual, harassment, at, the, university, in, 2019, for, example, former, student, danielle, bradford, represented, by, sexual, harassment, lawyer, ann, olivarius, sued, the, university, for, its, handling, of, her, sexual, misconduct, complaint, i, was, told, that, i, should, think, about, it, very, carefully, because, making, a, complaint, could, affect, my, place, in, my, department, bradford, alleged, in, 2019, in, 2020, hundreds, of, current, and, former, students, accused, the, university, in, a, letter, citing, a, complete, failure, to, deal, with, sexual, misconduct, complaints, the, relationship, between, the, university, and, the, city, of, cambridge, has, sometimes, been, uneasy, the, phrase, town, and, gown, continues, to, be, employed, to, distinguish, between, cambridge, residents, town, and, university, of, cambridge, students, gown, who, historically, wore, academical, dress, ferocious, rivalry, between, cambridge, s, residents, and, university, students, have, periodically, erupted, over, the, centuries, during, the, peasants, revolt, of, 1381, strong, clashes, led, to, attacks, and, looting, of, university, properties, as, locals, contested, the, privileges, granted, by, the, british, government, to, the, university, of, cambridge, s, academic, staff, residents, burned, university, property, in, market, square, to, the, famed, rallying, cry, away, with, the, learning, of, clerks, away, with, it, following, these, events, the, university, of, cambridge, s, chancellor, was, given, special, powers, allowing, him, to, prosecute, criminals, and, reestablish, order, in, the, city, attempts, at, reconciliation, between, the, city, s, residents, and, students, followed, in, the, 16th, century, agreements, were, signed, to, improve, the, quality, of, streets, and, student, accommodation, around, the, city, however, this, was, followed, by, new, confrontations, when, the, plague, reached, cambridge, in, 1630, and, colleges, refused, to, assist, those, affected, by, the, disease, by, locking, their, sites, such, conflicts, between, cambridge, s, residents, and, university, students, have, largely, disappeared, since, the, 16th, century, and, the, university, has, grown, as, a, source, of, enormous, employment, and, expanded, wealth, in, cambridge, and, the, region, the, university, also, has, proven, a, source, of, extraordinary, growth, in, high, tech, and, biotech, start, ups, and, established, companies, and, associated, providers, of, services, to, these, companies, the, economic, growth, associated, with, the, university, s, high, tech, and, biotech, growth, has, been, labeled, the, cambridge, phenomenon, and, has, included, the, addition, of, 1, 500, new, companies, and, as, many, as, 40, 000, new, jobs, added, between, 1960, and, 2010, mostly, at, silicon, fen, a, business, cluster, launched, by, the, university, in, the, late, 20th, century, partly, because, of, the, university, of, cambridge, s, extensive, history, which, now, exceeds, 800, years, the, university, has, developed, a, large, number, of, traditions, myths, and, legends, some, are, true, some, are, not, and, some, were, true, but, have, been, discontinued, but, have, been, propagated, nonetheless, by, generations, of, students, and, tour, guides, one, such, discontinued, tradition, is, that, of, the, wooden, spoon, the, prize, awarded, to, the, student, with, the, lowest, passing, honours, grade, in, the, final, examinations, of, the, university, s, mathematical, tripos, the, last, of, these, spoons, was, awarded, in, 1909, to, cuthbert, lempriere, holthouse, an, oarsman, of, the, lady, margaret, boat, club, at, st, john, s, college, it, was, over, one, metre, in, length, and, had, an, oar, blade, for, a, handle, it, can, now, be, seen, outside, the, senior, combination, room, of, st, john, s, college, since, 1908, examination, results, have, been, published, alphabetically, within, class, rather, than, in, strict, order, of, merit, which, made, it, difficult, to, ascertain, the, student, with, the, lowest, passing, grade, deserving, of, the, spoon, leading, to, discontinuation, of, the, tradition, each, christmas, eve, the, festival, of, nine, lessons, and, carols, sung, by, the, choir, of, king, s, college, are, broadcast, globally, on, bbc, world, service, television, and, radio, and, syndicated, to, hundreds, of, additional, radio, stations, in, the, u, s, and, elsewhere, the, radio, broadcast, has, been, a, national, christmas, eve, tradition, since, 1928, though, the, festival, has, existed, since, 1918, and, the, celebration, itself, originated, even, earlier, at, truro, cathedral, in, cornwall, in, 1880, the, first, television, broadcast, of, the, festival, was, in, 1954, the, university, occupies, a, central, location, within, the, city, of, cambridge, university, of, cambridge, students, represent, approximately, 20, percent, of, the, town, s, population, which, was, 145, 674, as, of, 2021, resulting, in, a, lower, age, demographic, in, the, city, most, of, the, university, s, older, colleges, are, located, near, the, city, centre, through, which, river, cam, flows, students, and, others, traditionally, punt, on, the, river, cam,

for, admission, to, other, university, colleges, which, maintains, consistency, throughout, the, colleges, some, of, which, receive, more, applicants, than, others, undergraduate, applications, are, processed, through, ucas, and, the, deadline, for, their, submission, currently, is, mid, october, in, the, year, before, prior, to, beginning, until, the, 1980s, candidates, for, all, subjects, were,

the, colleges, before, final, admissions, decisions, are, made, colleges, can, pool, any, candidate, either, because, the, college, has, no, space, but, believes, the, applicant, is, strong, enough, to, get, a, place, or, because, the, college, wants, to, compare, that, applicant, to, other, pooled, applicants, most, applicants, in, the, pool, are, pooled, at, their, original, college, s, discretion, but, some, candidates, meet, the, compulsory, pooling, criteria, there, were, as, of, the, 2020, 21, admissions, cycle, only, two, grounds, for, compulsory, pooling, for, post, qualified,

application, is, in, special, need, of, reassessment, this, is, used, when, candidates, whose, initial, interview, scores, are, of, questionable, accuracy, such, as, when, a, candidate, received, very, different, scores, from, different, interviewers, experienced, technical, issues, with, interviews, conducted, over, the, internet, or, was, impacted, by, significant, extenuating, circumstances, such, as, illness, or, the, loss, of, a, family, member, pooled, applicants, who, are, fished, by, a, college, may, be, offered, a, place, immediately, or, may, be, invited, for, an,

their, preference, college, and, a, further, 1, 000, to, 1, 100, applicants, are, offered, admission, by, another, college, through, the, pool, on, average, one, in, five, applicants, is, pooled, and, around, one, in, four, pooled, applicants, receives, an, offer, of, admission, statistics, released, by, the, university, show, that, some, colleges, regularly, receive, particularly, high, numbers, of, applicants, and, these, colleges, tend, to, take, fewer, applicants, from, the, pool, other, colleges, regularly, draw, a, greater, proportion, of, their, undergraduate, intake, from, the, pool, public, debate, in, the, united, kingdom, exists, over, whether, admissions, processes, used, at, the, university, of, oxford, and, cambridge, are, entirely, merit, based, and, fair, whether, enough,

schools, compared, to, approximately, 93, of, all, students, in, the, uk, who, attended, state, schools, and, 82, of, post, 16, students, critics, have, argued, that, the, relative, lower, percent, of, state, school, applicants, with, the, required, grades, for, admission, to, cambridge, and, oxford, has, had, a, negative, impact, on, oxford, and, cambridge, s, collective, reputation, though, both, universities, have, encouraged, pupils, from, state, schools, to, apply, to, help, redress, the, perceived, imbalance, others, counter, that, government, pressure, to, increase, state, school, admissions, constitutes, inappropriate, social, engineering, the, proportion, of, undergraduates, drawn, from, independent, schools, has, dropped, over, the, years, constituting, as, of, 2020, 26, of,

had, lower, success, rates, in, individual, subjects, even, when, they, had, the, same, grades, as, white, applicants, the, university, was, criticised, for, what, was, seen, as, institutional, discrimination, against, ethnic, minority, applicants, in, favour, of, white, applicants, the, university, denied, the, claims, of, institutional, discrimination, stating, the, figures, did, not, take, into, account, other, variables, a, subsequent, article, reported, that, in, the, years, 2010, to, 2012, ethnic, minority, applicants, to, medicine, with, 3, a, grades, or, higher, were, 20, less, likely, to, gain, admission, than, white, applicants, with, similar, grades, the, university, refused, to, provide, figures, for, a, wider, range, of, subjects, claiming, that, assembling, and, releasing, such, information, was, excessively, costly, given, the, competitive, nature, of, gaining, admission, to, the, university, of, cambridge, a, number, of, educational, consultancies, have, emerged, to, offer, support, with, the, application, process, some, claim, they, can, improve, chances, for, admission, though, these, claims, have, never, been, independently, verified, none, of, these, companies, are, affiliated, with, or, endorsed, by, the, university, of, cambridge, the, university, informs, applicants, that, all, necessary, information, regarding, the, application,
