social, factors, that, contribute, to, one, s, fate, blaming, others, can, lead, to, a, kick, the, dog, effect, where, individuals, in, a, hierarchy, blame, their, immediate, subordinate, and, this, propagates, down, a, hierarchy, until, the, lowest, rung, the, dog, a, 2009, experimental, study, has, shown, that, blaming, can, be, contagious, even, for, uninvolved, onlookers, in, complex, international, organizations, such, as, enforcers, of, national, and, supranational, policies, and, regulations, the, blame, is, usually, attributed, to, the, last, echelon, the, implementing, actors, labeling, theory, accounts, for, blame, by, postulating, that, when, intentional, actors, act, out, to, continuously, blame, an, individual, for, nonexistent, psychological, traits, and, for, nonexistent, variables, those, actors, aim, to, induce, irrational, guilt, at, an, unconscious, level, blame, in, this, case, becomes, a, propaganda, tactic, using, repetitive, blaming, behaviors, innuendos, and, hyperbole, in, order, to, assign, negative, status, to, normative, humans, when, innocent, people, are, blamed, fraudulently, for, nonexistent, psychological, states, and, nonexistent, behaviors, and, there, is, no, qualifying, deviance, for, the, blaming, behaviors, the, intention, is, to, create, a, negative, valuation, of, innocent, humans, to, induce, fear, by, using, fear, mongering, for, centuries, governments, have, used, blaming, in, the, form, of, demonization, to, influence, public, perceptions, of, various, other, governments, as, well, as, to, induce, feelings, of, nationalism, in, the, public, blame, can, objectify, people, groups, and, nations, typically, negatively, influencing, the, intended, subjects, of, propaganda, compromising, their, objectivity, blame, is, utilized, as, a, social, control, technique, the, flow, of, blame, in, an, organization, may, be, a, primary, indicator, of, that, organization, s, robustness, and, integrity, blame, flowing, downwards, from, management, to, staff, or, laterally, between, professionals, or, partner, organizations, indicates, organizational, failure, in, a, blame, culture, problem, solving, is, replaced, by, blame, avoidance, blame, coming, from, the, top, generates, fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and, passive, aggressive, responses, from, the, bottom, with, those, at, the, bottom, feeling, powerless, and, lacking, emotional, safety, employees, have, expressed, that, organizational, blame, culture, made, them, fear, prosecution, for, errors, and, or, accidents, and, thus, unemployment, which, may, make, them, more, reluctant, to, report, accidents, since, trust, is, crucial, to, encourage, accident, reporting, this, makes, it, less, likely, that, weak, and, or, long, term, indicators, of, safety, threats, get, picked, up, thus, preventing, the, organization, from, taking, adequate, measures, to, prevent, minor, problems, from, escalating, into, uncontrollable, situations, several, issues, identified, in, organizations, with, a, blame, culture, contradict, the, best, practices, adopted, by, high, reliability, organizations, organisational, chaos, such, as, confused, roles, and, responsibilities, is, strongly, associated, with, blame, culture, and, workplace, bullying, blame, culture, promotes, a, risk, aversive, approach, which, prevent, organizations, and, their, agents, from, adequately, assessing, risks, according, to, mary, douglas, blame, is, systematically, used, in, the, micro, politics, of, institutions, with, three, latent, functions, explaining, disasters, justifying, allegiances, and, stabilizing, existing, institutional, regimes, within, a, politically, stable, regime, blame, tends, to, be, asserted, on, the, weak, or, unlucky, one, but, in, a, less, stable, regime, blame, shifting, may, involve, a, battle, between, rival, factions, douglas, was, interested, in, how, blame, stabilizes, existing, power, structures, within, institutions, or, social, groups, she, devised, a, two, dimensional, typology, of, institutions, the, first, attribute, being, named, group, which, is, the, strength, of, boundaries, and, social, cohesion, the, second, grid, the, degree, and, strength, of, the, hierarchy, according, to, douglas, blame, will, fall, on, different, entities, depending, on, the, institutional, type, for, markets, blame, is, used, in, power, struggles, between, potential, leaders, in, bureaucracies, blame, tends, to, flow, downwards, and, is, attributed, to, a, failure, to, follow, rules, in, a, clan, blame, is, asserted, on, outsiders, or, involves, allegations, of, treachery, to, suppress, dissidence, and, strengthen, the, group, s, ties, in, the, 4th, type, isolation, the, individuals, are, facing, the, competitive, pressures, of, the, marketplace, alone, in, other, words, there, is, a, condition, of, fragmentation, with, a, loss, of, social, cohesion, potentially, leading, to, feelings, of, powerlessness, and, fatalism, and, this, type, was, renamed, by, various, other, authors, into, donkey, jobs, it, is, suggested, that, the, progressive, changes, in, managerial, practices, in, healthcare, is, leading, to, an, increase, in, donkey, jobs, the, requirement, of, accountability, and, transparency, assumed, to, be, key, for, good, governance, worsen, the, behaviors, of, blame, avoidance, both, at, the, individual, and, institutional, levels, as, is, observed, in, various, domains, such, as, politics, and, healthcare, indeed, institutions, tend, to, be, risk, averse, and, blame, averse, and, where, the, management, of, societal, risks, the, threats, to, society, and, institutional, risks, threats, to, the, organizations, managing, the, societal, risks, are, not, aligned, there, may, be, organizational, pressures, to, prioritize, the, management, of, institutional, risks, at, the, expense, of, societal, risks, furthermore, blame, avoidance, behaviour, at, the, expense, of, delivering, core, business, is, a, well, documented, organizational, rationality, the, willingness, of, maintaining, one, s, reputation, may, be, a, key, factor, explaining, the, relationship, between, accountability, and, blame, avoidance, this, may, produce, a, risk, colonization, where, institutional, risks, are, transferred, to, societal, risks, as, a, strategy, of, risk, management, some, researchers, argue, that, there, is, no, risk, free, lunch, and, no, blame, free, risk, an, analogy, to, the, no, free, lunch, adage
