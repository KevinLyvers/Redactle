braille, b, r, e, l, brayl, french, is, a, tactile, writing, system, used, by, people, who, are, visually, impaired, it, can, be, read, either, on, embossed, paper, or, by, using, refreshable, braille, displays, that, connect, to, computers, and, smartphone, devices, braille, can, be, written, using, a, slate, and, stylus, a, braille, writer, an, electronic, braille, notetaker, or, with, the, use, of, a, computer, connected, to, a, braille, embosser, braille, is, named, after, its, creator, louis, braille, a, frenchman, who, lost, his, sight, as, a, result, of, a, childhood, accident, in, 1824, at, the, age, of, fifteen, he, developed, the, braille, code, based, on, the, french, alphabet, as, an, improvement, on, night, writing, he, published, his, system, which, subsequently, included, musical, notation, in, 1829, the, second, revision, published, in, 1837, was, the, first, binary, form, of, writing, developed, in, the, modern, era, braille, characters, are, formed, using, a, combination, of, six, raised, dots, arranged, in, a, 3, 2, matrix, called, the, braille, cell, the, number, and, arrangement, of, these, dots, distinguishes, one, character, from, another, since, the, various, braille, alphabets, originated, as, transcription, codes, for, printed, writing, the, mappings, sets, of, character, designations, vary, from, language, to, language, and, even, within, one, in, english, braille, there, are, three, levels, uncontracted, a, letter, by, letter, transcription, used, for, basic, literacy, contracted, an, addition, of, abbreviations, and, contractions, used, as, a, space, saving, mechanism, and, grade, 3, various, non, standardized, personal, stenographies, that, are, less, commonly, used, in, addition, to, braille, text, letters, punctuation, contractions, it, is, also, possible, to, create, embossed, illustrations, and, graphs, with, the, lines, either, solid, or, made, of, series, of, dots, arrows, and, bullets, that, are, larger, than, braille, dots, a, full, braille, cell, includes, six, raised, dots, arranged, in, two, columns, each, column, having, three, dots, the, dot, positions, are, identified, by, numbers, from, one, to, six, there, are, 64, possible, combinations, including, no, dots, at, all, for, a, word, space, dot, configurations, can, be, used, to, represent, a, letter, digit, punctuation, mark, or, even, a, word, early, braille, education, is, crucial, to, literacy, education, and, employment, among, the, blind, despite, the, evolution, of, new, technologies, including, screen, reader, software, that, reads, information, aloud, braille, provides, blind, people, with, access, to, spelling, punctuation, and, other, aspects, of, written, language, less, accessible, through, audio, alone, while, some, have, suggested, that, audio, based, technologies, will, decrease, the, need, for, braille, technological, advancements, such, as, braille, displays, have, continued, to, make, braille, more, accessible, and, available, braille, users, highlight, that, braille, remains, as, essential, as, print, is, to, the, sighted, braille, was, based, on, a, tactile, code, now, known, as, night, writing, developed, by, charles, barbier, the, name, night, writing, was, later, given, to, it, when, it, was, considered, as, a, means, for, soldiers, to, communicate, silently, at, night, and, without, a, light, source, but, barbier, s, writings, do, not, use, this, term, and, suggest, that, it, was, originally, designed, as, a, simpler, form, of, writing, and, for, the, visually, impaired, in, barbier, s, system, sets, of, 12, embossed, dots, were, used, to, encode, 36, different, sounds, braille, identified, three, major, defects, of, the, code, first, the, symbols, represented, phonetic, sounds, and, not, letters, of, the, alphabet, thus, the, code, was, unable, to, render, the, orthography, of, the, words, second, the, 12, dot, symbols, could, not, easily, fit, beneath, the, pad, of, the, reading, finger, this, required, the, reading, finger, to, move, in, order, to, perceive, the, whole, symbol, which, slowed, the, reading, process, this, was, because, barbier, s, system, was, based, only, on, the, number, of, dots, in, each, of, two, 6, dot, columns, not, the, pattern, of, the, dots, third, the, code, did, not, include, symbols, for, numerals, or, punctuation, braille, s, solution, was, to, use, 6, dot, cells, and, to, assign, a, specific, pattern, to, each, letter, of, the, alphabet, braille, also, developed, symbols, for, representing, numerals, and, punctuation, at, first, braille, was, a, one, to, one, transliteration, of, the, french, alphabet, but, soon, various, abbreviations, contractions, and, even, logograms, were, developed, creating, a, system, much, more, like, shorthand, today, there, are, braille, codes, for, over, 133, languages, in, english, some, variations, in, the, braille, codes, have, traditionally, existed, among, english, speaking, countries, in, 1991, work, to, standardize, the, braille, codes, used, in, the, english, speaking, world, began, unified, english, braille, ueb, has, been, adopted, in, all, seven, member, countries, of, the, international, council, on, english, braille, iceb, as, well, as, nigeria, for, blind, readers, braille, is, an, independent, writing, system, rather, than, a, code, of, printed, orthography, braille, is, derived, from, the, latin, alphabet, albeit, indirectly, in, braille, s, original, system, the, dot, patterns, were, assigned, to, letters, according, to, their, position, within, the, alphabetic, order, of, the, french, alphabet, of, the, time, with, accented, letters, and, w, sorted, at, the, end, unlike, print, which, consists, of, mostly, arbitrary, symbols, the, braille, alphabet, follows, a, logical, sequence, the, first, ten, letters, of, the, alphabet, a, j, use, the, upper, four, dot, positions, black, dots, in, the, table, below, these, stand, for, the, ten, digits, 1, 9, and, 0, in, an, alphabetic, numeral, system, similar, to, greek, numerals, as, well, as, derivations, of, it, including, hebrew, numerals, cyrillic, numerals, abjad, numerals, also, hebrew, gematria, and, greek, isopsephy, though, the, dots, are, assigned, in, no, obvious, order, the, cells, with, the, fewest, dots, are, assigned, to, the, first, three, letters, and, lowest, digits, abc, 123, and, to, the, three, vowels, in, this, part, of, the, alphabet, aei, whereas, the, even, digits, 4, 6, 8, 0, are, right, angles, the, next, ten, letters, k, t, are, identical, to, a, j, respectively, apart, from, the, addition, of, a, dot, at, position, 3, red, dots, in, the, bottom, left, corners, of, the, cells, in, the, table, below, the, next, ten, letters, the, next, decade, are, the, same, again, but, with, dots, also, at, both, position, 3, and, position, 6, green, dots, in, the, bottom, rows, of, the, cells, in, the, table, above, here, w, was, initially, left, out, as, not, being, a, part, of, the, official, french, alphabet, at, the, time, of, braille, s, life, the, french, braille, order, is, u, v, x, y, z, the, next, ten, letters, ending, in, w, are, the, same, again, except, that, for, this, series, position, 6, purple, dot, in, the, bottom, right, corner, of, the, cell, in, the, table, above, is, used, without, a, dot, at, position, 3, in, french, braille, these, are, the, letters, w, w, had, been, tacked, onto, the, end, of, 39, letters, of, the, french, alphabet, to, accommodate, english, the, a, j, series, shifted, down, by, one, dot, space, is, used, for, punctuation, letters, a, and, c, which, only, use, dots, in, the, top, row, were, shifted, two, places, for, the, apostrophe, and, hyphen, these, are, also, the, decade, diacritics, at, left, in, the, table, below, of, the, second, and, third, decade, in, addition, there, are, ten, patterns, that, are, based, on, the, first, two, letters, with, their, dots, shifted, to, the, right, these, were, assigned, to, non, french, letters, or, serve, non, letter, functions, superscript, in, english, the, accent, mark, currency, prefix, capital, in, english, the, decimal, point, number, sign, emphasis, mark, symbol, prefix, the, first, four, decades, are, similar, in, respect, that, in, those, decades, the, decade, dots, are, applied, to, the, numeric, sequence, as, a, logical, inclusive, or, operation, whereas, the, fifth, decade, applies, a, shift, down, operation, to, the, numeric, sequence, originally, there, had, been, nine, decades, the, fifth, through, ninth, used, dashes, as, well, as, dots, but, proved, to, be, impractical, and, were, soon, abandoned, these, could, be, replaced, with, what, we, now, know, as, the, number, sign, though, that, only, caught, on, for, the, digits, old, 5th, decade, modern, 1st, decade, the, dash, occupying, the, top, row, of, the, original, sixth, decade, was, simply, dropped, producing, the, modern, fifth, decade, see, 1829, braille, historically, there, have, been, three, principles, in, assigning, the, values, of, a, linear, script, print, to, braille, using, louis, braille, s, original, french, letter, values, reassigning, the, braille, letters, according, to, the, sort, order, of, the, print, alphabet, being, transcribed, and, reassigning, the, letters, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, writing, in, braille, under, international, consensus, most, braille, alphabets, follow, the, french, sorting, order, for, the, 26, letters, of, the, basic, latin, alphabet, and, there, have, been, attempts, at, unifying, the, letters, beyond, these, 26, see, international, braille, though, differences, remain, for, example, in, german, braille, this, unification, avoids, the, chaos, of, each, nation, reordering, the, braille, code, to, match, the, sorting, order, of, its, print, alphabet, as, happened, in, algerian, braille, where, braille, codes, were, numerically, reassigned, to, match, the, order, of, the, arabic, alphabet, and, bear, little, relation, to, the, values, used, in, other, countries, compare, modern, arabic, braille, which, uses, the, french, sorting, order, and, as, happened, in, an, early, american, version, of, english, braille, where, the, letters, w, x, y, z, were, reassigned, to, match, english, alphabetical, order, a, convention, sometimes, seen, for, letters, beyond, the, basic, 26, is, to, exploit, the, physical, symmetry, of, braille, patterns, iconically, for, example, by, assigning, a, reversed, n, to, or, an, inverted, s, to, sh, see, hungarian, braille, and, bharati, braille, which, do, this, to, some, extent, a, third, principle, was, to, assign, braille, codes, according, to, frequency, with, the, simplest, patterns, quickest, ones, to, write, with, a, stylus, assigned, to, the, most, frequent, letters, of, the, alphabet, such, frequency, based, alphabets, were, used, in, germany, and, the, united, states, in, the, 19th, century, see, american, braille, but, with, the, invention, of, the, braille, typewriter, their, advantage, disappeared, and, none, are, attested, in, modern, use, they, had, the, disadvantage, that, the, resulting, small, number, of, dots, in, a, text, interfered, with, following, the, alignment, of, the, letters, and, consequently, made, texts, more, difficult, to, read, than, braille, s, more, arbitrary, letter, assignment, finally, there, are, braille, scripts, that, do, not, order, the, codes, numerically, at, all, such, as, japanese, braille, and, korean, braille, which, are, based, on, more, abstract, principles, of, syllable, composition, texts, are, sometimes, written, in, a, script, of, eight, dots, per, cell, rather, than, six, enabling, them, to, encode, a, greater, number, of, symbols, see, gardner, salinas, braille, codes, luxembourgish, braille, has, adopted, eight, dot, cells, for, general, use, for, example, accented, letters, take, the, unaccented, versions, plus, dot, 8, braille, was, the, first, writing, system, with, binary, encoding, the, system, as, devised, by, braille, consists, of, two, parts, within, an, individual, cell, the, dot, positions, are, arranged, in, two, columns, of, three, positions, a, raised, dot, can, appear, in, any, of, the, six, positions, producing, 64, 2, 6, possible, patterns, including, one, in, which, there, are, no, raised, dots, for, reference, purposes, a, pattern, is, commonly, described, by, listing, the, positions, where, dots, are, raised, the, positions, being, universally, numbered, from, top, to, bottom, as, 1, to, 3, on, the, left, and, 4, to, 6, on, the, right, for, example, dot, pattern, 1, 3, 4, describes, a, cell, with, three, dots, raised, at, the, top, and, bottom, in, the, left, column, and, at, the, top, of, the, right, column, that, is, the, letter, m, the, lines, of, horizontal, braille, text, are, separated, by, a, space, much, like, visible, printed, text, so, that, the, dots, of, one, line, can, be, differentiated, from, the, braille, text, above, and, below, different, assignments, of, braille, codes, or, code, pages, are, used, to, map, the, character, sets, of, different, printed, scripts, to, the, six, bit, cells, braille, assignments, have, also, been, created, for, mathematical, and, musical, notation, however, because, the, six, dot, braille, cell, allows, only, 64, 2, 6, patterns, including, space, the, characters, of, a, braille, script, commonly, have, multiple, values, depending, on, their, context, that, is, character, mapping, between, print, and, braille, is, not, one, to, one, for, example, the, character, corresponds, in, print, to, both, the, letter, d, and, the, digit, 4, in, addition, to, simple, encoding, many, braille, alphabets, use, contractions, to, reduce, the, size, of, braille, texts, and, to, increase, reading, speed, see, contracted, braille, braille, may, be, produced, by, hand, using, a, slate, and, stylus, in, which, each, dot, is, created, from, the, back, of, the, page, writing, in, mirror, image, or, it, may, be, produced, on, a, braille, typewriter, or, perkins, brailler, or, an, electronic, brailler, or, braille, notetaker, braille, users, with, access, to, smartphones, may, also, activate, the, on, screen, braille, input, keyboard, to, type, braille, symbols, on, to, their, device, by, placing, their, fingers, on, to, the, screen, according, to, the, dot, configuration, of, the, symbols, they, wish, to, form, these, symbols, are, automatically, translated, into, print, on, the, screen, the, different, tools, that, exist, for, writing, braille, allow, the, braille, user, to, select, the, method, that, is, best, for, a, given, task, for, example, the, slate, and, stylus, is, a, portable, writing, tool, much, like, the, pen, and, paper, for, the, sighted, errors, can, be, erased, using, a, braille, eraser, or, can, be, overwritten, with, all, six, dots, interpoint, refers, to, braille, printing, that, is, offset, so, that, the, paper, can, be, embossed, on, both, sides, with, the, dots, on, one, side, appearing, between, the, divots, that, form, the, dots, on, the, other, using, a, computer, or, other, electronic, device, braille, may, be, produced, with, a, braille, embosser, printer, or, a, refreshable, braille, display, screen, braille, has, been, extended, to, an, 8, dot, code, particularly, for, use, with, braille, embossers, and, refreshable, braille, displays, in, 8, dot, braille, the, additional, dots, are, added, at, the, bottom, of, the, cell, giving, a, matrix, 4, dots, high, by, 2, dots, wide, the, additional, dots, are, given, the, numbers, 7, for, the, lower, left, dot, and, 8, for, the, lower, right, dot, eight, dot, braille, has, the, advantages, that, the, case, of, an, individual, letter, is, directly, coded, in, the, cell, containing, the, letter, and, that, all, the, printable, ascii, characters, can, be, represented, in, a, single, cell, all, 256, 2, 8, possible, combinations, of, 8, dots, are, encoded, by, the, unicode, standard, braille, with, six, dots, is, frequently, stored, as, braille, ascii, the, first, 25, braille, letters, up, through, the, first, half, of, the, 3rd, decade, transcribe, a, z, skipping, w, in, english, braille, the, rest, of, that, decade, is, rounded, out, with, the, ligatures, and, for, of, the, and, with, omitting, dot, 3, from, these, forms, the, 4th, decade, the, ligatures, ch, gh, sh, th, wh, ed, er, ou, ow, and, the, letter, w, see, english, braille, various, formatting, marks, affect, the, values, of, the, letters, that, follow, them, they, have, no, direct, equivalent, in, print, the, most, important, in, english, braille, are, that, is, is, read, as, capital, a, and, as, the, digit, 1, basic, punctuation, marks, in, english, braille, include, is, both, the, question, mark, and, the, opening, quotation, mark, its, reading, depends, on, whether, it, occurs, before, a, word, or, after, is, used, for, both, opening, and, closing, parentheses, its, placement, relative, to, spaces, and, other, characters, determines, its, interpretation, punctuation, varies, from, language, to, language, for, example, french, braille, uses, for, its, question, mark, and, swaps, the, quotation, marks, and, parentheses, to, and, it, uses, the, period, for, the, decimal, point, as, in, print, and, the, decimal, point, to, mark, capitalization, braille, contractions, are, words, and, affixes, that, are, shortened, so, that, they, take, up, fewer, cells, in, english, braille, for, example, the, word, afternoon, is, written, with, just, three, letters, afn, much, like, stenoscript, there, are, also, several, abbreviation, marks, that, create, what, are, effectively, logograms, the, most, common, of, these, is, dot, 5, which, combines, with, the, first, letter, of, words, with, the, letter, m, the, resulting, word, is, mother, there, are, also, ligatures, contracted, letters, which, are, single, letters, in, braille, but, correspond, to, more, than, one, letter, in, print, the, letter, and, for, example, is, used, to, write, words, with, the, sequence, a, n, d, in, them, such, as, grand, most, braille, embossers, support, between, 34, and, 40, cells, per, line, and, 25, lines, per, page, a, manually, operated, perkins, braille, typewriter, supports, a, maximum, of, 42, cells, per, line, its, margins, are, adjustable, and, typical, paper, allows, 25, lines, per, page, a, large, interlining, stainsby, has, 36, cells, per, line, and, 18, lines, per, page, an, a4, sized, marburg, braille, frame, which, allows, interpoint, braille, dots, on, both, sides, of, the, page, offset, so, they, do, not, interfere, with, each, other, has, 30, cells, per, line, and, 27, lines, per, page, a, braille, writing, machine, is, a, typewriter, with, six, keys, that, allows, the, user, to, write, braille, on, a, regular, hard, copy, page, the, first, braille, typewriter, to, gain, general, acceptance, was, invented, by, frank, haven, hall, superintendent, of, the, illinois, school, for, the, blind, and, was, presented, to, the, public, in, 1892, the, stainsby, brailler, developed, by, henry, stainsby, in, 1903, is, a, mechanical, writer, with, a, sliding, carriage, that, moves, over, an, aluminium, plate, as, it, embosses, braille, characters, an, improved, version, was, introduced, around, 1933, in, 1951, david, abraham, a, woodworking, teacher, at, the, perkins, school, for, the, blind, produced, a, more, advanced, braille, typewriter, the, perkins, brailler, braille, printers, or, embossers, were, produced, in, the, 1950s, in, 1960, robert, mann, a, teacher, in, mit, wrote, dotsys, a, software, that, allowed, automatic, braille, translation, and, another, group, created, an, embossing, device, called, m, i, t, braillemboss, the, mitre, corporation, team, of, robert, gildea, jonathan, millen, reid, gerhart, and, joseph, sullivan, now, president, of, duxbury, systems, developed, dotsys, iii, the, first, braille, translator, written, in, a, portable, programming, language, dotsys, iii, was, developed, for, the, atlanta, public, schools, as, a, public, domain, program, in, 1991, ernest, bate, developed, the, mountbatten, brailler, an, electronic, machine, used, to, type, braille, on, braille, paper, giving, it, a, number, of, additional, features, such, as, word, processing, audio, feedback, and, embossing, this, version, was, improved, in, 2008, with, a, quiet, writer, that, had, an, erase, key, in, 2011, david, s, morgan, produced, the, first, smart, brailler, machine, with, added, text, to, speech, function, and, allowed, digital, capture, of, data, entered, braille, is, traditionally, read, in, hardcopy, form, such, as, with, paper, books, written, in, braille, documents, produced, in, paper, braille, such, as, restaurant, menus, and, braille, labels, or, public, signage, it, can, also, be, read, on, a, refreshable, braille, display, either, as, a, stand, alone, electronic, device, or, connected, to, a, computer, or, smartphone, refreshable, braille, displays, convert, what, is, visually, shown, on, a, computer, or, smartphone, screen, into, braille, through, a, series, of, pins, that, rise, and, fall, to, form, braille, symbols, currently, more, than, 1, of, all, printed, books, have, been, translated, into, hardcopy, braille, the, fastest, braille, readers, apply, a, light, touch, and, read, braille, with, two, hands, although, reading, braille, with, one, hand, is, also, possible, although, the, finger, can, read, only, one, braille, character, at, a, time, the, brain, chunks, braille, at, a, higher, level, processing, words, a, digraph, root, or, suffix, at, a, time, the, processing, largely, takes, place, in, the, visual, cortex, children, who, are, blind, miss, out, on, fundamental, parts, of, early, and, advanced, education, if, not, provided, with, the, necessary, tools, such, as, access, to, educational, materials, in, braille, children, who, are, blind, or, visually, impaired, can, begin, learning, foundational, braille, skills, from, a, very, young, age, to, become, fluent, braille, readers, as, they, get, older, sighted, children, are, naturally, exposed, to, written, language, on, signs, on, tv, and, in, the, books, they, see, blind, children, require, the, same, early, exposure, to, literacy, through, access, to, braille, rich, environments, and, opportunities, to, explore, the, world, around, them, print, braille, books, for, example, present, text, in, both, print, and, braille, and, can, be, read, by, sighted, parents, to, blind, children, and, vice, versa, allowing, blind, children, to, develop, an, early, love, for, reading, even, before, formal, reading, instruction, begins, adults, who, experience, sight, loss, later, in, life, or, who, did, not, have, the, opportunity, to, learn, it, when, they, were, younger, can, also, learn, braille, in, most, cases, adults, who, learn, braille, were, already, literate, in, print, before, vision, loss, and, so, instruction, focuses, more, on, developing, the, tactile, and, motor, skills, needed, to, read, braille, while, different, countries, publish, statistics, on, how, many, readers, in, a, given, organization, request, braille, these, numbers, only, provide, a, partial, picture, of, braille, literacy, statistics, for, example, this, data, does, not, survey, the, entire, population, of, braille, readers, or, always, include, readers, who, are, no, longer, in, the, school, system, adults, or, readers, who, request, electronic, braille, materials, therefore, there, are, currently, no, reliable, statistics, on, braille, literacy, rates, as, described, in, a, publication, in, the, journal, of, visual, impairment, and, blindness, regardless, of, the, precise, percentage, of, braille, readers, there, is, consensus, that, braille, should, be, provided, to, all, those, who, benefit, from, it, numerous, factors, influence, access, to, braille, literacy, including, school, budget, constraints, technology, advancements, such, as, screen, reader, software, access, to, qualified, instruction, and, different, philosophical, views, over, how, blind, children, should, be, educated, in, the, usa, a, key, turning, point, for, braille, literacy, was, the, passage, of, the, rehabilitation, act, of, 1973, an, act, of, congress, that, moved, thousands, of, children, from, specialized, schools, for, the, blind, into, mainstream, public, schools, because, only, a, small, percentage, of, public, schools, could, afford, to, train, and, hire, braille, qualified, teachers, braille, literacy, has, declined, since, the, law, took, effect, braille, literacy, rates, have, improved, slightly, since, the, bill, was, passed, in, part, because, of, pressure, from, consumers, and, advocacy, groups, that, has, led, 27, states, to, pass, legislation, mandating, that, children, who, are, legally, blind, be, given, the, opportunity, to, learn, braille, in, 1998, there, were, 57, 425, legally, blind, students, registered, in, the, united, states, but, only, 10, 5, 461, of, them, used, braille, as, their, primary, reading, medium, early, braille, education, is, crucial, to, literacy, for, a, blind, or, low, vision, child, a, study, conducted, in, the, state, of, washington, found, that, people, who, learned, braille, at, an, early, age, did, just, as, well, as, if, not, better, than, their, sighted, peers, in, several, areas, including, vocabulary, and, comprehension, in, the, preliminary, adult, study, while, evaluating, the, correlation, between, adult, literacy, skills, and, employment, it, was, found, that, 44, of, the, participants, who, had, learned, to, read, in, braille, were, unemployed, compared, to, the, 77, unemployment, rate, of, those, who, had, learned, to, read, using, print, currently, among, the, estimated, 85, 000, blind, adults, in, the, united, states, 90, of, those, who, are, braille, literate, are, employed, among, adults, who, do, not, know, braille, only, 33, are, employed, statistically, history, has, proven, that, braille, reading, proficiency, provides, an, essential, skill, set, that, allows, blind, or, low, vision, children, to, compete, with, their, sighted, peers, in, a, school, environment, and, later, in, life, as, they, enter, the, workforce, regardless, of, the, specific, percentage, of, braille, readers, proponents, point, out, the, importance, of, increasing, access, to, braille, for, all, those, who, can, benefit, from, it, although, it, is, possible, to, transcribe, print, by, simply, substituting, the, equivalent, braille, character, for, its, printed, equivalent, in, english, such, a, character, by, character, transcription, known, as, uncontracted, braille, is, typically, used, by, beginners, or, those, who, only, engage, in, short, reading, tasks, such, as, reading, household, labels, braille, characters, are, much, larger, than, their, printed, equivalents, and, the, standard, 11, by, 11, 1, 2, in, 28, by, 29, cm, page, has, room, for, only, 25, lines, of, 43, characters, to, reduce, space, and, increase, reading, speed, most, braille, alphabets, and, orthographies, use, ligatures, abbreviations, and, contractions, virtually, all, english, braille, books, in, hardcopy, paper, format, are, transcribed, in, contracted, braille, the, library, of, congress, s, instruction, manual, for, braille, transcribing, runs, to, over, 300, pages, and, braille, transcribers, must, pass, certification, tests, uncontracted, braille, was, previously, known, as, grade, 1, braille, and, contracted, braille, was, previously, known, as, grade, 2, braille, uncontracted, braille, is, a, direct, transliteration, of, print, words, one, to, one, correspondence, hence, the, word, about, would, contain, all, the, same, letters, in, uncontracted, braille, as, it, does, in, inkprint, contracted, braille, includes, short, forms, to, save, space, hence, for, example, the, letters, ab, when, standing, alone, represent, the, word, about, in, english, contracted, braille, in, english, some, braille, users, only, learn, uncontracted, braille, particularly, if, braille, is, being, used, for, shorter, reading, tasks, such, as, reading, household, labels, however, those, who, plan, to, use, braille, for, educational, and, employment, purposes, and, longer, reading, texts, often, go, on, to, contracted, braille, the, system, of, contractions, in, english, braille, begins, with, a, set, of, 23, words, contracted, to, single, characters, thus, the, word, but, is, contracted, to, the, single, letter, b, can, to, c, do, to, d, and, so, on, even, this, simple, rule, creates, issues, requiring, special, cases, for, example, d, is, specifically, an, abbreviation, of, the, verb, do, the, noun, do, representing, the, note, of, the, musical, scale, is, a, different, word, and, must, be, spelled, out, portions, of, words, may, be, contracted, and, many, rules, govern, this, process, for, example, the, character, with, dots, 2, 3, 5, the, letter, f, lowered, in, the, braille, cell, stands, for, ff, when, used, in, the, middle, of, a, word, at, the, beginning, of, a, word, this, same, character, stands, for, the, word, to, the, character, is, written, in, braille, with, no, space, following, it, this, contraction, was, removed, in, the, unified, english, braille, code, at, the, end, of, a, word, the, same, character, represents, an, exclamation, point, some, contractions, are, more, similar, than, their, print, equivalents, for, example, the, contraction, lr, meaning, letter, differs, from, ll, meaning, little, only, by, one, dot, in, the, second, letter, little, letter, this, causes, greater, confusion, between, the, braille, spellings, of, these, words, and, can, hinder, the, learning, process, of, contracted, braille, the, contraction, rules, take, into, account, the, linguistic, structure, of, the, word, thus, contractions, are, generally, not, to, be, used, when, their, use, would, alter, the, usual, braille, form, of, a, base, word, to, which, a, prefix, or, suffix, has, been, added, some, portions, of, the, transcription, rules, are, not, fully, codified, and, rely, on, the, judgment, of, the, transcriber, thus, when, the, contraction, rules, permit, the, same, word, in, more, than, one, way, preference, is, given, to, the, contraction, that, more, nearly, approximates, correct, pronunciation, grade, 3, braille, is, a, variety, of, non, standardized, systems, that, include, many, additional, shorthand, like, contractions, they, are, not, used, for, publication, but, by, individuals, for, their, personal, convenience, when, people, produce, braille, this, is, called, braille, transcription, when, computer, software, produces, braille, this, is, called, a, braille, translator, braille, translation, software, exists, to, handle, almost, all, of, the, common, languages, of, the, world, and, many, technical, areas, such, as, mathematics, mathematical, notation, for, example, wimats, music, musical, notation, and, tactile, graphics, since, braille, is, one, of, the, few, writing, systems, where, tactile, perception, is, used, as, opposed, to, visual, perception, a, braille, reader, must, develop, new, skills, one, skill, important, for, braille, readers, is, the, ability, to, create, smooth, and, even, pressures, when, running, one, s, fingers, along, the, words, there, are, many, different, styles, and, techniques, used, for, the, understanding, and, development, of, braille, even, though, a, study, by, b, f, holland, suggests, that, there, is, no, specific, technique, that, is, superior, to, any, other, another, study, by, lowenfield, abel, shows, that, braille, can, be, read, the, fastest, and, best, by, students, who, read, using, the, index, fingers, of, both, hands, another, important, reading, skill, emphasized, in, this, study, is, to, finish, reading, the, end, of, a, line, with, the, right, hand, and, to, find, the, beginning, of, the, next, line, with, the, left, hand, simultaneously, when, braille, was, first, adapted, to, languages, other, than, french, many, schemes, were, adopted, including, mapping, the, native, alphabet, to, the, alphabetical, order, of, french, e, g, in, english, w, which, was, not, in, the, french, alphabet, at, the, time, is, mapped, to, braille, x, x, to, y, y, to, z, and, z, to, the, first, french, accented, letter, or, completely, rearranging, the, alphabet, such, that, common, letters, are, represented, by, the, simplest, braille, patterns, consequently, mutual, intelligibility, was, greatly, hindered, by, this, state, of, affairs, in, 1878, the, international, congress, on, work, for, the, blind, held, in, paris, proposed, an, international, braille, standard, where, braille, codes, for, different, languages, and, scripts, would, be, based, not, on, the, order, of, a, particular, alphabet, but, on, phonetic, correspondence, and, transliteration, to, latin, this, unified, braille, has, been, applied, to, the, languages, of, india, and, africa, arabic, vietnamese, hebrew, russian, and, armenian, as, well, as, nearly, all, latin, script, languages, in, greek, for, example, g, is, written, as, latin, g, despite, the, fact, that, it, has, the, alphabetic, position, of, c, hebrew, b, the, second, letter, of, the, alphabet, and, cognate, with, the, latin, letter, b, is, sometimes, pronounced, b, and, sometimes, v, and, is, written, b, or, v, accordingly, russian, ts, is, written, as, c, which, is, the, usual, letter, for, ts, in, those, slavic, languages, that, use, the, latin, alphabet, and, arabic, f, is, written, as, f, despite, being, historically, p, and, occurring, in, that, part, of, the, arabic, alphabet, between, historic, o, and, q, other, systems, for, assigning, values, to, braille, patterns, are, also, followed, beside, the, simple, mapping, of, the, alphabetical, order, onto, the, original, french, order, some, braille, alphabets, start, with, unified, braille, and, then, diverge, significantly, based, on, the, phonology, of, the, target, languages, while, others, diverge, even, further, in, the, various, chinese, systems, traditional, braille, values, are, used, for, initial, consonants, and, the, simple, vowels, in, both, mandarin, and, cantonese, braille, however, characters, have, different, readings, depending, on, whether, they, are, placed, in, syllable, initial, onset, or, syllable, final, rime, position, for, instance, the, cell, for, latin, k, represents, cantonese, k, g, in, yale, and, other, modern, romanizations, when, initial, but, aak, when, final, while, latin, j, represents, cantonese, initial, j, but, final, oei, novel, systems, of, braille, mapping, include, korean, which, adopts, separate, syllable, initial, and, syllable, final, forms, for, its, consonants, explicitly, grouping, braille, cells, into, syllabic, groups, in, the, same, way, as, hangul, japanese, meanwhile, combines, independent, vowel, dot, patterns, and, modifier, consonant, dot, patterns, into, a, single, braille, cell, an, abugida, representation, of, each, japanese, mora, braille, is, read, by, people, who, are, blind, deafblind, or, who, have, low, vision, and, by, both, those, born, with, a, visual, impairment, and, those, who, experience, sight, loss, later, in, life, braille, may, also, be, used, by, print, impaired, people, who, although, may, be, fully, sighted, due, to, a, physical, disability, are, unable, to, read, print, even, individuals, with, low, vision, will, find, that, they, benefit, from, braille, depending, on, level, of, vision, or, context, for, example, when, lighting, or, colour, contrast, is, poor, braille, is, used, for, both, short, and, long, reading, tasks, examples, of, short, reading, tasks, include, braille, labels, for, identifying, household, items, or, cards, in, a, wallet, reading, elevator, buttons, accessing, phone, numbers, recipes, grocery, lists, and, other, personal, notes, examples, of, longer, reading, tasks, include, using, braille, to, access, educational, materials, novels, and, magazines, people, with, access, to, a, refreshable, braille, display, can, also, use, braille, for, reading, email, and, ebooks, browsing, the, internet, and, accessing, other, electronic, documents, it, is, also, possible, to, adapt, or, purchase, playing, cards, and, board, games, in, braille, in, india, there, are, instances, where, the, parliament, acts, have, been, published, in, braille, such, as, the, right, to, information, act, sylheti, braille, is, used, in, northeast, india, in, canada, passenger, safety, information, in, braille, and, tactile, seat, row, markers, are, required, aboard, planes, trains, large, ferries, and, interprovincial, busses, pursuant, to, the, canadian, transportation, agency, s, regulations, in, the, united, states, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, of, 1990, requires, various, building, signage, to, be, in, braille, in, the, united, kingdom, it, is, required, that, medicines, have, the, name, of, the, medicine, in, braille, on, the, labeling, the, current, series, of, canadian, banknotes, has, a, tactile, feature, consisting, of, raised, dots, that, indicate, the, denomination, allowing, bills, to, be, easily, identified, by, blind, or, low, vision, people, it, does, not, use, standard, braille, numbers, to, identify, the, value, instead, the, number, of, full, braille, cells, which, can, be, simply, counted, by, both, braille, readers, and, non, braille, readers, alike, is, an, indicator, of, the, value, of, the, bill, mexican, bank, notes, australian, bank, notes, indian, rupee, notes, israeli, new, shekel, notes, and, russian, ruble, notes, also, have, special, raised, symbols, to, make, them, identifiable, by, persons, who, are, blind, or, have, low, vision, euro, coins, were, designed, in, cooperation, with, organisations, representing, blind, people, and, as, a, result, they, incorporate, many, features, allowing, them, to, be, distinguished, by, touch, alone, in, addition, their, visual, appearance, is, designed, to, make, them, easy, to, tell, apart, for, persons, who, cannot, read, the, inscriptions, on, the, coins, a, good, design, for, the, blind, and, partially, sighted, is, a, good, design, for, everybody, was, the, principle, behind, the, cooperation, of, the, european, central, bank, and, the, european, blind, union, during, the, design, phase, of, the, first, series, euro, banknotes, in, the, 1990s, as, a, result, the, design, of, the, first, euro, banknotes, included, several, characteristics, which, aid, both, the, blind, and, partially, sighted, to, confidently, use, the, notes, australia, introduced, the, tactile, feature, onto, their, five, dollar, banknote, in, 2016, in, the, united, kingdom, the, front, of, the, 10, polymer, note, the, side, with, raised, print, has, two, clusters, of, raised, dots, in, the, top, left, hand, corner, and, the, 20, note, has, three, this, tactile, feature, helps, blind, and, partially, sighted, people, identify, the, value, of, the, note, in, 2003, the, us, mint, introduced, the, commemorative, alabama, state, quarter, which, recognized, state, daughter, helen, keller, on, the, obverse, including, the, name, helen, keller, in, both, english, script, and, braille, inscription, this, appears, to, be, the, first, known, use, of, braille, on, us, coin, currency, though, not, standard, on, all, coins, of, this, type, the, braille, set, was, added, to, the, unicode, standard, in, version, 3, 0, 1999, most, braille, embossers, and, refreshable, braille, displays, do, not, use, the, unicode, code, points, but, instead, reuse, the, 8, bit, code, points, that, are, assigned, to, standard, ascii, for, braille, ascii, thus, for, simple, material, the, same, bitstream, may, be, interpreted, equally, as, visual, letter, forms, for, sighted, readers, or, their, exact, semantic, equivalent, in, tactile, patterns, for, blind, readers, however, some, codes, have, quite, different, tactile, versus, visual, interpretations, and, most, are, not, even, defined, in, braille, ascii, some, embossers, have, proprietary, control, codes, for, 8, dot, braille, or, for, full, graphics, mode, where, dots, may, be, placed, anywhere, on, the, page, without, leaving, any, space, between, braille, cells, so, that, continuous, lines, can, be, drawn, in, diagrams, but, these, are, rarely, used, and, are, not, standard, the, unicode, standard, encodes, 6, dot, and, 8, dot, braille, glyphs, according, to, their, binary, appearance, rather, than, following, their, assigned, numeric, order, dot, 1, corresponds, to, the, least, significant, bit, of, the, low, byte, of, the, unicode, scalar, value, and, dot, 8, to, the, high, bit, of, that, byte, the, unicode, block, for, braille, is, u, 2800, u, 28ff, the, mapping, of, patterns, to, characters, etc, is, language, dependent, even, for, english, for, example, see, american, braille, and, english, braille, every, year, on, 4, january, world, braille, day, is, observed, internationally, to, commemorate, the, birth, of, louis, braille, and, to, recognize, his, efforts, although, the, event, is, not, considered, a, public, holiday, it, has, been, recognized, by, the, united, nations, as, an, official, day, of, celebration, since, 2019, there, is, a, variety, of, contemporary, electronic, devices, that, serve, the, needs, of, blind, people, that, operate, in, braille, such, as, refreshable, braille, displays, and, braille, e, books, that, use, different, technologies, for, transmitting, graphic, information, of, different, types, pictures, maps, graphs, texts, etc, the, characters, have, been, arranged, by, decade, with, decade, diacritics, listed, at, left, and, supplementary, characters, included, on, the, right, according, to, their, diacritic, see, 1829, braille, where, the, 12, characters, listed, in, the, first, line, are, used, for, shorthand, and, are, found, in, this, order, for, the, 12, notes, of, plainsong, notation, and, french, braille, where, the, final, form, of, braille, s, alphabet, is, laid, out, in, the, same, way, however, modern, tables, often, organize, the, supplementary, characters, differently, those, with, a, dot, 3, are, listed, as, a, 6th, group, of, 6, characters, and, those, with, dots, only, on, the, right, side, are, listed, as, a, 7th, group, of, 7, without, anything, in, common, with, the, other, characters, in, the, columns, they, are, listed, under
