a, black, market, underground, economy, or, shadow, economy, is, a, clandestine, market, or, series, of, transactions, that, has, some, aspect, of, illegality, or, is, not, compliant, with, an, institutional, set, of, rules, if, the, rule, defines, the, set, of, goods, and, services, whose, production, and, distribution, is, prohibited, or, restricted, by, law, non, compliance, with, the, rule, constitutes, a, black, market, trade, since, the, transaction, itself, is, illegal, such, transactions, include, the, illegal, drug, trade, prostitution, where, prohibited, illegal, currency, transactions, and, human, trafficking, participants, try, to, hide, their, illegal, behavior, from, the, government, or, regulatory, authority, cash, is, the, preferred, medium, of, exchange, in, illegal, transactions, since, cash, transactions, are, less, easily, traced, common, motives, for, operating, in, black, markets, are, to, trade, contraband, avoid, taxes, and, regulations, or, evade, price, controls, or, rationing, typically, the, totality, of, such, activity, is, referred, to, with, the, definite, article, e, g, the, black, market, in, bush, meat, the, black, market, is, distinct, from, the, grey, market, in, which, commodities, are, distributed, through, channels, that, while, legal, are, unofficial, unauthorized, or, unintended, by, the, original, manufacturer, and, the, white, market, in, which, trade, is, legal, and, official, black, money, is, the, proceeds, of, an, illegal, transaction, on, which, income, and, other, taxes, have, not, been, paid, black, money, is, often, associated, with, money, laundering, a, process, used, to, conceal, the, illegitimate, source, of, the, money, because, of, the, clandestine, nature, of, the, black, economy, it, is, not, possible, to, determine, its, size, and, scope, the, literature, on, the, black, market, has, not, established, a, common, terminology, and, has, instead, offered, many, synonyms, including, subterranean, hidden, grey, shadow, informal, clandestine, illegal, unobserved, unreported, unrecorded, second, parallel, and, black, there, is, no, single, underground, economy, there, are, many, these, underground, economies, are, omnipresent, existing, in, market, oriented, as, well, as, in, centrally, planned, nations, be, they, developed, or, developing, those, engaged, in, underground, activities, circumvent, escape, or, are, excluded, from, the, institutional, system, of, rules, rights, regulations, and, enforcement, penalties, that, govern, formal, agents, engaged, in, production, and, exchange, different, types, of, underground, activities, are, distinguished, according, to, the, particular, institutional, rules, that, they, violate, the, illegal, economy, consists, of, economic, activities, pursued, in, violation, of, legal, statutes, that, define, the, scope, of, legitimate, forms, of, commerce, illegal, economy, participants, produce, and, distribute, prohibited, goods, and, services, such, as, drugs, weapons, and, prostitution, the, unreported, economy, circumvents, or, evades, institutionally, established, fiscal, rules, as, codified, in, the, tax, code, a, summary, measure, of, the, unreported, economy, is, the, amount, of, income, that, should, be, reported, to, the, tax, authority, but, is, not, so, reported, a, complementary, measure, of, the, unreported, economy, is, the, tax, gap, the, difference, between, the, amount, of, tax, revenues, due, the, fiscal, authority, and, the, amount, of, tax, revenue, actually, collected, in, the, u, s, unreported, income, is, estimated, to, be, 2, trillion, resulting, in, a, tax, gap, of, 450, 600, billion, the, unrecorded, economy, circumvents, the, institutional, rules, that, define, the, reporting, requirements, of, government, statistical, agencies, a, summary, measure, of, the, unrecorded, economy, is, the, amount, of, unrecorded, income, namely, the, amount, of, income, that, should, under, existing, rules, and, conventions, be, recorded, in, national, accounting, systems, e, g, national, income, and, product, accounts, but, is, not, unrecorded, income, is, a, particular, problem, in, transition, countries, that, switched, from, a, socialist, accounting, system, to, un, standard, national, accounting, new, methods, have, been, proposed, for, estimating, the, size, of, the, unrecorded, non, observed, economy, but, little, consensus, exists, on, the, size, of, the, unreported, economies, of, transitional, countries, the, informal, economy, circumvents, the, costs, of, and, is, excluded, from, the, benefits, and, rights, incorporated, in, the, laws, and, administrative, rules, covering, property, relationships, commercial, licensing, labor, contracts, torts, financial, credit, and, social, security, systems, a, summary, measure, of, the, informal, economy, is, the, income, generated, by, economic, agents, that, operate, informally, the, informal, sector, is, the, part, of, an, economy, that, is, not, taxed, monitored, by, government, or, included, in, gross, national, product, gnp, unlike, the, formal, economy, in, developed, countries, the, informal, sector, is, characterized, by, unreported, employment, this, is, hidden, from, the, state, for, tax, social, security, or, labour, law, purposes, but, is, legal, in, other, aspects, the, term, black, market, can, also, be, used, in, reference, to, a, specific, part, of, the, economy, in, which, contraband, is, traded, goods, and, services, acquired, illegally, and, or, transacted, for, in, an, illegal, manner, may, exchange, above, or, below, the, price, of, legal, market, transactions, no, government, no, global, nonprofit, no, multinational, enterprise, can, seriously, claim, to, be, able, to, replace, the, 1, 8, billion, jobs, created, by, the, economic, underground, in, truth, the, best, hope, for, growth, in, most, emerging, economies, lies, in, the, shadows, even, when, the, underground, market, offers, lower, prices, consumers, may, still, buy, on, the, legal, market, when, possible, because, however, in, some, situations, consumers, may, conclude, that, they, are, better, off, using, black, market, services, particularly, when, government, regulations, hinder, what, would, otherwise, be, a, legitimate, competitive, service, for, example, in, baltimore, many, consumers, actively, prefer, illegal, taxi, cabs, citing, that, they, are, more, available, convenient, and, fairly, priced, some, examples, of, underground, economic, activities, include, prostitution, is, illegal, or, highly, regulated, in, many, countries, this, demonstrates, the, underground, economy, because, of, consistent, high, demand, from, customers, relatively, high, pay, but, labor, intensive, and, low, skilled, work, which, attracts, a, continual, supply, of, workers, while, prostitution, exists, in, every, country, studies, show, that, it, tends, to, flourish, more, in, poorer, countries, and, in, areas, with, large, numbers, of, unattached, men, such, as, around, military, bases, for, instance, an, empirical, study, showed, that, the, supply, of, prostitutes, rose, abruptly, in, denver, and, minneapolis, in, 2008, when, the, democratic, and, republican, national, conventions, took, place, there, prostitutes, in, the, black, market, generally, operate, with, some, degree, of, secrecy, sometimes, negotiating, prices, and, activities, through, codewords, and, subtle, gestures, in, countries, such, as, germany, or, the, netherlands, where, prostitution, is, legal, but, regulated, illegal, prostitutes, exist, whose, services, are, offered, more, cheaply, without, regard, for, the, legal, requirements, or, procedures, health, checks, standards, of, accommodation, and, so, on, in, other, countries, such, as, nicaragua, where, legal, prostitution, is, regulated, hotels, may, require, both, parties, to, identify, themselves, to, prevent, child, prostitution, personally, identifying, information, financial, information, like, credit, card, and, bank, account, information, and, medical, data, is, bought, and, sold, mostly, in, darknet, markets, people, increase, the, value, of, the, stolen, data, by, aggregating, it, with, publicly, available, data, and, sell, it, again, for, a, profit, increasing, the, damage, that, can, be, done, to, the, people, whose, data, was, stolen, from, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, many, countries, began, to, ban, the, possession, or, use, of, some, recreational, drugs, such, as, in, the, united, states, war, on, drugs, many, people, nonetheless, continue, to, use, illegal, drugs, and, a, black, market, exists, to, supply, them, despite, law, enforcement, efforts, to, intercept, them, demand, remains, high, providing, a, large, profit, motive, for, organized, criminal, groups, to, keep, drugs, supplied, the, united, nations, has, reported, that, the, retail, market, value, of, illegal, drugs, is, 502, billion, although, law, enforcement, agencies, intercept, a, fraction, of, drug, traffickers, and, incarcerate, thousands, of, wholesale, and, retail, sellers, and, users, the, demand, for, such, drugs, and, profit, margins, encourage, new, distributors, to, enter, the, market, drug, legalization, activists, draw, parallels, between, the, illegal, drug, trade, and, the, prohibition, of, alcohol, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1920s, the, laws, of, many, countries, forbid, or, restrict, the, personal, ownership, of, weapons, these, restrictions, can, range, from, small, knives, to, firearms, either, altogether, or, by, classification, e, g, caliber, handguns, automatic, weapons, and, explosives, the, black, market, supplies, the, demands, for, weaponry, that, cannot, be, obtained, legally, or, may, only, be, obtained, legally, after, obtaining, permits, and, paying, fees, this, may, be, by, smuggling, the, arms, from, countries, where, they, were, bought, legally, or, stolen, or, by, stealing, from, arms, manufacturers, within, the, country, itself, using, insiders, in, cases, where, the, underground, economy, is, unable, to, smuggle, firearms, they, can, also, satisfy, requests, by, gunsmithing, their, own, firearms, those, who, may, buy, this, way, include, criminals, to, use, for, illegal, activities, gun, collectors, and, otherwise, law, abiding, citizens, interested, in, protecting, their, dwellings, families, or, businesses, in, england, and, wales, certain, categories, of, weapons, used, for, hunting, may, be, owned, by, qualified, residents, but, must, be, registered, with, the, local, police, force, and, kept, within, a, locked, cabinet, among, those, who, may, purchase, weapons, on, the, black, market, are, people, who, are, unable, to, pass, the, legal, requirements, for, registration, convicted, felons, or, those, suffering, from, mental, illness, for, example, the, illegal, logging, of, timber, according, to, interpol, is, an, industry, worth, almost, as, much, as, the, drug, production, industry, in, some, countries, in, many, developing, countries, living, animals, are, captured, in, the, wild, and, sold, as, pets, wild, animals, are, also, hunted, and, killed, for, their, meat, hide, and, organs, the, latter, of, which, and, other, animal, parts, are, sold, for, use, in, traditional, medicine, in, several, states, in, the, united, states, laws, requiring, the, pasteurization, of, milk, have, created, black, markets, in, raw, milk, and, sometimes, in, raw, milk, cheese, which, is, legal, in, a, number, of, eu, countries, but, banned, in, the, u, s, if, aged, less, than, 60, days, rum, running, or, bootlegging, is, the, illegal, business, of, transporting, smuggling, alcoholic, beverages, where, such, transportation, is, forbidden, by, law, smuggling, is, usually, done, to, circumvent, taxation, or, prohibition, laws, the, term, rum, running, is, more, commonly, applied, to, smuggling, over, water, bootlegging, is, applied, to, smuggling, over, land, according, to, the, pbs, documentary, prohibition, the, term, bootlegging, was, popularized, when, thousands, of, city, dwellers, would, sell, liquor, from, flasks, they, kept, in, their, boot, leg, all, across, major, cities, and, rural, areas, the, term, rum, running, most, likely, originated, at, the, start, of, prohibition, in, the, united, states, 1920, 1933, when, ships, from, bimini, in, the, western, bahamas, transported, cheap, caribbean, rum, to, florida, speakeasies, rum, s, cheapness, made, it, a, low, profit, item, for, the, rum, runners, and, they, moved, on, to, smuggling, canadian, whisky, french, champagne, and, english, gin, to, major, cities, like, new, york, city, and, boston, where, prices, ran, high, it, was, said, that, some, ships, carried, 200, 000, roughly, equivalent, to, us, 4, 5, million, in, 2022, in, contraband, in, a, single, run, the, united, kingdom, has, some, of, the, highest, taxes, on, tobacco, products, in, the, world, and, strict, limits, on, the, amount, of, tobacco, that, can, be, imported, duty, free, from, other, countries, leading, to, widespread, attempts, to, smuggle, relatively, cheap, tobacco, from, low, tax, countries, into, the, u, k, such, smuggling, efforts, range, from, vacationers, concealing, relatively, small, quantities, of, tobacco, in, their, luggage, to, large, scale, enterprises, linked, to, organized, crime, british, authorities, have, aggressively, tried, to, detect, and, confiscate, such, illegal, imports, and, to, prosecute, those, caught, nevertheless, it, has, been, reported, that, 27, of, cigarettes, and, 68, of, roll, your, own, tobacco, is, purchased, on, the, black, market, smuggling, one, truckload, of, cigarettes, from, a, low, tax, u, s, state, to, a, high, tax, state, can, result, in, a, profit, of, up, to, 3, million, because, traffic, crossing, u, s, state, borders, is, not, usually, stopped, or, inspected, to, the, same, extent, as, happens, at, the, country, s, international, borders, interdicting, this, sort, of, smuggling, especially, without, causing, major, disruption, to, interstate, commerce, is, difficult, low, tax, states, are, generally, the, major, tobacco, producers, and, have, come, under, criticism, for, their, reluctance, to, increase, taxes, north, carolina, eventually, agreed, to, raise, its, taxes, from, 5, cents, to, 35, cents, per, pack, of, 20, cigarettes, although, this, remains, far, below, the, national, average, as, of, 2010, south, carolina, has, refused, to, follow, suit, and, raise, taxes, from, seven, cents, per, pack, the, lowest, in, the, usa, according, to, the, world, health, organization, who, illegal, organ, trade, occurs, when, organs, are, removed, from, the, body, for, the, purpose, of, commercial, transactions, the, who, justifies, its, stance, on, the, issue, by, stating, payment, for, organs, is, likely, to, take, unfair, advantage, of, the, poorest, and, most, vulnerable, groups, undermines, altruistic, donation, and, leads, to, profiteering, and, human, trafficking, despite, prohibitions, it, was, estimated, that, 5, of, all, organ, recipients, engaged, in, commercial, organ, transplant, in, 2005, research, indicates, that, illegal, organ, trade, is, on, the, rise, with, a, recent, report, by, global, financial, integrity, estimating, that, the, illegal, organ, trade, generates, profits, between, 600, million, and, 1, 2, billion, per, year, across, many, countries, a, racket, is, a, service, that, is, fraudulently, offered, to, solve, a, problem, such, as, for, a, problem, that, does, not, actually, exist, or, that, would, not, otherwise, exist, if, the, racket, did, not, exist, conducting, a, racket, is, called, racketeering, the, potential, problem, may, be, caused, by, the, same, party, that, offers, to, solve, it, although, that, fact, may, be, concealed, with, the, intent, to, engender, continual, patronage, for, the, racketeer, an, archetype, is, the, protection, racket, wherein, a, person, or, group, e, g, a, criminal, gang, indicates, to, a, store, owner, that, they, could, protect, her, his, store, from, potential, damage, damage, that, the, same, person, or, group, would, otherwise, inflict, while, the, correlation, of, threat, and, protection, may, be, more, or, less, deniably, veiled, distinguishing, it, from, the, more, direct, act, of, extortion, racketeering, is, often, associated, with, organized, crime, the, term, was, coined, by, the, employers, association, of, chicago, in, june, 1927, in, a, statement, about, the, influence, of, organized, crime, in, the, teamsters, union, where, taxicabs, buses, and, other, transportation, providers, are, strictly, regulated, or, monopolized, by, government, a, black, market, typically, flourishes, to, provide, transportation, to, poorly, served, or, overpriced, communities, in, the, united, states, some, cities, restrict, entry, to, the, taxicab, market, with, a, medallion, system, taxicabs, must, get, a, special, license, and, display, it, on, a, medallion, in, the, vehicle, in, most, such, jurisdictions, it, is, legal, to, sell, the, medallions, but, the, limited, supply, and, resulting, high, prices, of, medallions, have, led, to, a, market, in, unlicensed, carpooling, illegal, taxicab, operation, in, baltimore, maryland, for, example, it, is, not, uncommon, for, private, individuals, to, provide, illegal, taxicab, service, for, city, residents, in, places, where, there, is, rent, control, and, subsidized, affordable, housing, which, provide, housing, below, the, market, cost, there, may, be, a, black, market, for, housing, rentals, for, instance, in, the, uk, there, is, illegal, subletting, of, social, housing, homes, where, the, tenant, illegally, rents, out, the, government, subsidized, home, at, a, higher, rent, in, sweden, rental, contracts, with, regulated, rent, can, be, bought, on, the, black, market, either, from, the, current, tenant, or, sometimes, directly, from, the, property, owner, specialized, black, market, dealers, assist, the, property, owners, with, such, transactions, items, such, as, medicines, as, well, as, essential, aircraft, and, automobile, parts, e, g, brakes, motor, parts, etc, are, counterfeited, on, a, large, scale, street, vendors, in, countries, where, there, is, little, enforcement, of, copyright, law, particularly, in, asia, and, latin, america, often, sell, copies, of, films, music, cds, and, computer, software, such, as, video, games, sometimes, even, before, the, official, release, of, the, title, a, determined, counterfeiter, with, a, few, hundred, dollars, can, make, copies, that, are, digitally, identical, to, an, original, with, no, loss, in, quality, innovations, in, consumer, dvd, and, cd, writers, and, the, widespread, availability, of, cracks, on, the, internet, for, most, forms, of, copy, protection, technology, make, this, cheap, and, easy, to, do, copyright, holders, and, other, proponents, of, copyright, laws, have, found, this, phenomenon, hard, to, stop, through, the, courts, as, the, operations, are, distributed, and, widespread, traversing, national, borders, and, thus, legal, systems, since, digital, information, can, be, duplicated, repeatedly, with, no, loss, of, quality, and, passed, on, electronically, at, little, to, no, cost, the, effective, underground, market, value, of, media, is, zero, differentiating, it, from, nearly, all, other, forms, of, underground, economic, activity, the, issue, is, compounded, by, widespread, indifference, to, enforcing, copyright, law, both, with, governments, and, the, public, at, large, additionally, not, all, people, agree, with, copyright, laws, on, the, grounds, that, they, unfairly, criminalize, competition, allowing, the, copyright, holder, to, effectively, monopolize, related, industries, copyright, holders, also, may, use, region, coding, to, discriminate, against, selected, populations, price, wise, and, availability, wise, copyright, infringement, law, goes, as, far, as, to, deem, illegal, mixtapes, and, other, such, material, copied, to, tape, or, disk, copyright, holders, typically, attest, the, act, of, theft, to, be, in, the, profits, forgone, to, the, pirates, however, this, makes, the, unsubstantiated, assumption, that, the, pirates, would, have, bought, the, copyrighted, material, if, it, had, not, been, available, through, file, sharing, or, other, means, copyright, holders, also, say, that, they, did, work, creating, their, copyrighted, material, and, they, wish, to, get, compensated, for, their, work, no, other, system, than, copyright, has, been, found, to, compensate, artists, and, other, creators, for, their, work, and, many, artists, do, not, have, an, alternative, source, of, income, or, another, job, many, artists, and, film, producers, have, accepted, the, role, of, piracy, in, media, distribution, the, spread, of, material, through, file, sharing, is, a, source, of, publicity, for, artists, and, builds, fan, bases, that, may, be, inclined, to, see, the, performer, live, live, performances, make, up, the, bulk, of, successful, artists, revenues, however, not, all, artists, can, make, live, performances, for, example, photographers, typically, only, have, a, single, source, of, income, the, licensing, of, their, photos, money, itself, may, be, subject, to, a, black, market, money, may, be, exchangeable, for, a, differing, amount, of, the, same, currency, if, it, has, been, acquired, illegally, and, needs, to, be, laundered, before, the, money, can, be, used, counterfeit, money, may, be, sold, for, a, lesser, amount, of, genuine, currency, the, rate, of, exchange, between, a, local, and, foreign, currency, may, be, subject, to, a, black, market, often, described, as, a, parallel, exchange, rate, or, similar, terms, this, may, happen, for, one, or, more, of, several, reasons, a, government, may, officially, set, the, rate, of, exchange, of, its, currency, with, that, of, other, harder, currencies, when, it, does, so, the, peg, may, overvalue, the, local, currency, relative, to, what, its, market, value, would, be, if, it, were, a, floating, currency, those, in, possession, of, the, harder, currency, for, example, expatriate, workers, may, be, able, to, use, the, black, market, to, buy, the, local, currency, at, better, exchange, rates, than, they, can, get, officially, in, situations, of, financial, instability, and, inflation, citizens, may, substitute, a, foreign, currency, for, the, local, currency, the, u, s, dollar, is, viewed, as, a, relatively, stable, and, safe, currency, and, is, often, used, abroad, as, a, second, currency, in, 2012, us, 340, billion, roughly, 37, percent, of, all, u, s, currency, was, believed, to, be, circulating, abroad, the, most, recent, study, of, the, amount, of, currency, held, overseas, suggests, that, only, 25, percent, of, u, s, currency, was, held, abroad, in, 2014, the, widespread, substitution, of, u, s, currency, for, local, currency, is, known, as, de, facto, dollarisation, and, has, been, observed, in, transition, countries, such, as, cambodia, and, in, some, latin, american, countries, some, countries, such, as, ecuador, abandoned, their, local, currency, and, use, u, s, dollars, essentially, for, this, reason, a, process, known, as, de, jure, dollarization, see, also, the, example, of, the, ghanaian, cedi, from, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, if, foreign, currency, is, difficult, or, illegal, for, local, citizens, to, acquire, they, will, pay, a, premium, to, acquire, it, u, s, currency, is, viewed, as, a, relatively, stable, store, of, value, and, since, it, does, not, leave, a, paper, trail, it, is, also, a, convenient, medium, of, exchange, for, both, illegal, transactions, and, for, unreported, income, both, in, the, u, s, and, abroad, more, recently, cryptocurrencies, such, as, bitcoin, have, been, used, as, a, medium, of, exchange, in, black, market, transactions, cryptocurrencies, are, sometimes, favored, over, centralized, currency, due, to, their, pseudonymous, nature, and, their, ability, to, be, traded, over, the, internet, within, the, european, single, market, it, is, legal, for, a, person, or, business, to, buy, fuel, in, one, eu, state, for, use, in, a, vehicle, in, another, as, well, as, a, small, amount, of, fuel, in, a, container, but, as, with, other, goods, taxes, such, as, vat, will, generally, be, payable, by, the, final, customer, at, the, physical, place, of, making, the, purchase, when, fuel, is, transported, across, borders, for, resale, such, taxes, can, often, be, recovered, and, then, relevant, taxes, are, payable, in, the, country, of, sale, but, there, are, no, customs, checks, on, borders, between, countries, within, the, european, union, customs, union, differences, in, tax, rates, can, thus, lead, to, opportunities, for, arbitrage, even, when, prices, before, tax, are, equal, in, a, form, that, is, illegal, as, a, form, of, tax, evasion, for, example, between, the, republic, of, ireland, and, northern, ireland, there, has, often, been, a, black, market, in, petrol, and, diesel, the, direction, of, smuggling, can, change, depending, on, variation, in, the, taxes, and, the, exchange, rate, between, the, republic, s, euro, and, previously, punt, and, northern, ireland, s, pound, sterling, indeed, sometimes, diesel, will, be, smuggled, in, one, direction, and, petrol, the, other, in, some, countries, diesel, fuel, for, agricultural, vehicles, or, domestic, use, is, taxed, at, a, much, lower, rate, than, that, for, other, vehicles, this, is, known, as, dyed, fuel, because, a, colored, dye, is, added, so, it, can, be, detected, if, used, in, other, vehicles, e, g, a, red, dye, in, the, uk, a, green, dye, in, ireland, the, saving, is, attractive, enough, to, make, for, a, black, market, in, agricultural, diesel, which, was, estimated, in, 2007, to, cost, the, uk, 350, million, annually, in, lost, tax, in, countries, including, india, and, nepal, the, price, of, fuel, is, set, by, the, government, and, it, is, illegal, to, sell, the, fuel, at, a, higher, price, during, the, petrol, crisis, in, nepal, black, marketing, in, fuel, became, common, especially, during, mass, petrol, shortage, at, times, people, queued, for, hours, or, even, overnight, to, get, fuel, petrol, pump, operators, were, alleged, to, hoard, the, fuel, and, sell, it, to, black, marketeers, black, marketing, in, vehicle, cooking, fuel, became, widespread, during, the, 2015, nepal, blockade, even, after, it, was, eased, and, petrol, imports, resumed, people, were, not, getting, the, fuel, as, intended, and, resorted, to, the, black, market, in, some, countries, including, saudi, arabia, thailand, and, india, sex, toys, are, illegal, and, are, sold, illegally, without, compliance, with, regulations, on, safety, etc, platforms, used, to, sell, sex, toys, on, the, black, market,
