an, academic, journal, or, scholarly, journal, is, a, periodical, publication, in, which, scholarship, relating, to, a, particular, academic, discipline, is, published, they, serve, as, permanent, and, transparent, forums, for, the, presentation, scrutiny, and, discussion, of, research, they, nearly, universally, require, peer, review, for, research, articles, or, other, scrutiny, from, contemporaries, competent, and, established, in, their, respective, fields, content, typically, takes, the, form, of, articles, presenting, original, research, review, articles, or, book, reviews, the, purpose, of, an, academic, journal, according, to, henry, oldenburg, the, first, editor, of, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, is, to, give, researchers, a, venue, to, impart, their, knowledge, to, one, another, and, contribute, what, they, can, to, the, grand, design, of, improving, natural, knowledge, and, perfecting, all, philosophical, arts, and, sciences, the, term, academic, journal, applies, to, scholarly, publications, in, all, fields, this, article, discusses, the, aspects, common, to, all, academic, field, journals, scientific, journals, and, journals, of, the, quantitative, social, sciences, vary, in, form, and, function, from, journals, of, the, humanities, and, qualitative, social, sciences, their, specific, aspects, are, separately, discussed, the, first, academic, journal, was, journal, des, s, avans, january, 1665, followed, soon, after, by, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, march, 1665, and, m, moires, de, l, acad, mie, des, sciences, 1666, the, first, fully, peer, reviewed, journal, was, medical, essays, and, observations, 1733, the, idea, of, a, published, journal, with, the, purpose, of, people, know, what, is, happening, in, the, republic, of, letters, was, first, conceived, by, fran, ois, eudes, de, m, zeray, in, 1663, a, publication, titled, journal, litt, raire, g, n, ral, was, supposed, to, be, published, to, fulfill, that, goal, but, never, was, humanist, scholar, denis, de, sallo, under, the, pseudonym, sieur, de, h, douville, and, printer, jean, cusson, took, mazerai, s, idea, and, obtained, a, royal, privilege, from, king, louis, xiv, on, 8, august, 1664, to, establish, the, journal, des, s, avans, the, journal, s, first, issue, was, published, on, 5, january, 1665, it, was, aimed, at, people, of, letters, and, had, four, main, objectives, soon, after, the, royal, society, established, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, in, march, 1665, and, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, established, the, m, moires, de, l, acad, mie, des, sciences, in, 1666, which, focused, on, scientific, communications, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, nearly, 500, such, periodicals, had, been, published, the, vast, majority, coming, from, germany, 304, periodicals, france, 53, and, england, 34, several, of, those, publications, in, particular, the, german, journals, tended, to, be, short, lived, under, five, years, a, j, meadows, has, estimated, the, proliferation, of, journals, to, reach, 10, 000, journals, in, 1950, and, 71, 000, in, 1987, michael, mabe, wrote, that, the, estimates, will, vary, depending, on, the, definition, of, what, exactly, counts, as, a, scholarly, publication, but, that, the, growth, rate, has, been, remarkably, consistent, over, time, with, an, average, rate, of, 3, 46, per, year, from, 1800, to, 2003, in, 1733, medical, essays, and, observations, was, established, by, the, medical, society, of, edinburgh, as, the, first, fully, peer, reviewed, journal, peer, review, was, introduced, as, an, attempt, to, increase, the, quality, and, pertinence, of, submissions, other, important, events, in, the, history, of, academic, journals, include, the, establishment, of, nature, 1869, and, science, 1880, the, establishment, of, postmodern, culture, in, 1990, as, the, first, online, only, journal, the, foundation, of, arxiv, in, 1991, for, the, dissemination, of, preprints, to, be, discussed, prior, to, publication, in, a, journal, and, the, establishment, of, plos, one, in, 2006, as, the, first, megajournal, there, are, two, kinds, of, article, or, paper, submissions, in, academia, solicited, where, an, individual, has, been, invited, to, submit, work, either, through, direct, contact, or, through, a, general, submissions, call, and, unsolicited, where, an, individual, submits, a, work, for, potential, publication, without, directly, being, asked, to, do, so, upon, receipt, of, a, submitted, article, editors, at, the, journal, determine, whether, to, reject, the, submission, outright, or, begin, the, process, of, peer, review, in, the, latter, case, the, submission, becomes, subject, to, review, by, outside, scholars, of, the, editor, s, choosing, who, typically, remain, anonymous, the, number, of, these, peer, reviewers, or, referees, varies, according, to, each, journal, s, editorial, practice, typically, no, fewer, than, two, though, sometimes, three, or, more, experts, in, the, subject, matter, of, the, article, produce, reports, upon, the, content, style, and, other, factors, which, inform, the, editors, publication, decisions, though, these, reports, are, generally, confidential, some, journals, and, publishers, also, practice, public, peer, review, the, editors, either, choose, to, reject, the, article, ask, for, a, revision, and, resubmission, or, accept, the, article, for, publication, even, accepted, articles, are, often, subjected, to, further, sometimes, considerable, editing, by, journal, editorial, staff, before, they, appear, in, print, the, peer, review, can, take, from, several, weeks, to, several, months, review, articles, also, called, reviews, of, progress, are, checks, on, the, research, published, in, journals, some, journals, are, devoted, entirely, to, review, articles, some, contain, a, few, in, each, issue, and, others, do, not, publish, review, articles, such, reviews, often, cover, the, research, from, the, preceding, year, some, for, longer, or, shorter, terms, some, are, devoted, to, specific, topics, some, to, general, surveys, some, reviews, are, enumerative, listing, all, significant, articles, in, a, given, subject, others, are, selective, including, only, what, they, think, worthwhile, yet, others, are, evaluative, judging, the, state, of, progress, in, the, subject, field, some, journals, are, published, in, series, each, covering, a, complete, subject, field, year, or, covering, specific, fields, through, several, years, unlike, original, research, articles, review, articles, tend, to, be, solicited, or, peer, invited, submissions, often, planned, years, in, advance, which, may, themselves, go, through, a, peer, review, process, once, received, they, are, typically, relied, upon, by, students, beginning, a, study, in, a, given, field, or, for, current, awareness, of, those, already, in, the, field, reviews, of, scholarly, books, are, checks, upon, the, research, books, published, by, scholars, unlike, articles, book, reviews, tend, to, be, solicited, journals, typically, have, a, separate, book, review, editor, determining, which, new, books, to, review, and, by, whom, if, an, outside, scholar, accepts, the, book, review, editor, s, request, for, a, book, review, he, or, she, generally, receives, a, free, copy, of, the, book, from, the, journal, in, exchange, for, a, timely, review, publishers, send, books, to, book, review, editors, in, the, hope, that, their, books, will, be, reviewed, the, length, and, depth, of, research, book, reviews, varies, much, from, journal, to, journal, as, does, the, extent, of, textbook, and, trade, book, review, an, academic, journal, s, prestige, is, established, over, time, and, can, reflect, many, factors, some, but, not, all, of, which, are, expressible, quantitatively, in, each, academic, discipline, some, journals, receive, a, high, number, of, submissions, and, opt, to, restrict, how, many, they, publish, keeping, the, acceptance, rate, low, size, or, prestige, are, not, a, guarantee, of, reliability, in, the, natural, sciences, and, in, the, social, sciences, the, impact, factor, is, an, established, proxy, measuring, the, number, of, later, articles, citing, articles, already, published, in, the, journal, there, are, other, quantitative, measures, of, prestige, such, as, the, overall, number, of, citations, how, quickly, articles, are, cited, and, the, average, half, life, of, articles, clarivate, analytics, journal, citation, reports, which, among, other, features, computes, an, impact, factor, for, academic, journals, draws, data, for, computation, from, the, science, citation, index, expanded, for, natural, science, journals, and, from, the, social, sciences, citation, index, for, social, science, journals, several, other, metrics, are, also, used, including, the, scimago, journal, rank, citescore, eigenfactor, and, altmetrics, in, the, anglo, american, humanities, there, is, no, tradition, as, there, is, in, the, sciences, of, giving, impact, factors, that, could, be, used, in, establishing, a, journal, s, prestige, recent, moves, have, been, made, by, the, european, science, foundation, esf, to, change, the, situation, resulting, in, the, publication, of, preliminary, lists, for, the, ranking, of, academic, journals, in, the, humanities, these, rankings, have, been, severely, criticized, notably, by, history, and, sociology, of, science, british, journals, that, have, published, a, common, editorial, entitled, journals, under, threat, though, it, did, not, prevent, esf, and, some, national, organizations, from, proposing, journal, rankings, it, largely, prevented, their, use, as, evaluation, tools, in, some, disciplines, such, as, knowledge, management, intellectual, capital, the, lack, of, a, well, established, journal, ranking, system, is, perceived, by, academics, as, a, major, obstacle, on, the, way, to, tenure, promotion, and, achievement, recognition, conversely, a, significant, number, of, scientists, and, organizations, consider, the, pursuit, of, impact, factor, calculations, as, inimical, to, the, goals, of, science, and, have, signed, the, san, francisco, declaration, on, research, assessment, to, limit, its, use, three, categories, of, techniques, have, developed, to, assess, journal, quality, and, create, journal, rankings, many, academic, journals, are, subsidized, by, universities, or, professional, organizations, and, do, not, exist, to, make, a, profit, they, often, accept, advertising, page, and, image, charges, from, authors, to, pay, for, production, costs, on, the, other, hand, some, journals, are, produced, by, commercial, publishers, who, do, make, a, profit, by, charging, subscriptions, to, individuals, and, libraries, they, may, also, sell, all, of, their, journals, in, discipline, specific, collections, or, a, variety, of, other, packages, journal, editors, tend, to, have, other, professional, responsibilities, most, often, as, teaching, professors, in, the, case, of, the, largest, journals, there, are, paid, staff, assisting, in, the, editing, the, production, of, the, journals, is, almost, always, done, by, publisher, paid, staff, humanities, and, social, science, academic, journals, are, usually, subsidized, by, universities, or, professional, organization, the, cost, and, value, proposition, of, subscription, to, academic, journals, is, being, continuously, re, assessed, by, institutions, worldwide, in, the, context, of, the, big, deal, cancellations, by, several, library, systems, in, the, world, data, analysis, tools, like, unpaywall, journals, are, used, by, libraries, to, estimate, the, specific, cost, and, value, of, the, various, options, libraries, can, avoid, subscriptions, for, materials, already, served, by, instant, open, access, via, open, archives, like, pubmed, central, the, internet, has, revolutionized, the, production, of, and, access, to, academic, journals, with, their, contents, available, online, via, services, subscribed, to, by, academic, libraries, individual, articles, are, subject, indexed, in, databases, such, as, google, scholar, some, of, the, smallest, most, specialized, journals, are, prepared, in, house, by, an, academic, department, and, published, only, online, this, has, sometimes, been, in, the, blog, format, though, some, like, the, open, access, journal, internet, archaeology, use, the, medium, to, embed, searchable, datasets, 3d, models, and, interactive, mapping, currently, there, is, a, movement, in, higher, education, encouraging, open, access, either, via, self, archiving, whereby, the, author, deposits, a, paper, in, a, disciplinary, or, institutional, repository, where, it, can, be, searched, for, and, read, or, via, publishing, it, in, a, free, open, access, journal, which, does, not, charge, for, subscriptions, being, either, subsidized, or, financed, by, a, publication, fee, given, the, goal, of, sharing, scientific, research, to, speed, advances, open, access, has, affected, science, journals, more, than, humanities, journals, commercial, publishers, are, experimenting, with, open, access, models, but, are, trying, to, protect, their, subscription, revenues, the, much, lower, entry, cost, of, on, line, publishing, has, also, raised, concerns, of, an, increase, in, publication, of, junk, journals, with, lower, publishing, standards, these, journals, often, with, names, chosen, as, similar, to, well, established, publications, solicit, articles, via, e, mail, and, then, charge, the, author, to, publish, an, article, often, with, no, sign, of, actual, review, jeffrey, beall, a, research, librarian, at, the, university, of, colorado, has, compiled, a, list, of, what, he, considers, to, be, potential, possible, or, probable, predatory, scholarly, open, access, publishers, the, list, numbered, over, 300, journals, as, of, april, 2013, but, he, estimates, that, there, may, be, thousands, the, omics, publishing, group, which, publishes, a, number, of, the, journals, on, this, list, threatened, to, sue, beall, in, 2013, and, beall, stopped, publishing, in, 2017, citing, pressure, from, his, university, a, us, judge, fined, omics, 50, million, in, 2019, stemming, from, an, ftc, lawsuit, some, academic, journals, use, the, registered, report, format, which, aims, to, counteract, issues, such, as, data, dredging, and, hypothesizing, after, the, results, are, known, for, example, nature, human, behaviour, has, adopted, the, registered, report, format, as, it, shift, the, emphasis, from, the, results, of, research, to, the, questions, that, guide, the, research, and, the, methods, used, to, answer, them, the, european, journal, of, personality, defines, this, format, in, a, registered, report, authors, create, a, study, proposal, that, includes, theoretical, and, empirical, background, research, questions, hypotheses, and, pilot, data, if, available, upon, submission, this, proposal, will, then, be, reviewed, prior, to, data, collection, and, if, accepted, the, paper, resulting, from, this, peer, reviewed, procedure, will, be, published, regardless, of, the, study, outcomes, some, journals, are, born, digital, in, that, they, are, solely, published, on, the, web, and, in, a, digital, format, though, most, electronic, journals, originated, as, print, journals, which, subsequently, evolved, to, have, an, electronic, version, while, still, maintaining, a, print, component, others, eventually, became, electronic, only, an, e, journal, closely, resembles, a, print, journal, in, structure, there, is, a, table, of, contents, which, lists, the, articles, and, many, electronic, journals, still, use, a, volume, issue, model, although, some, titles, now, publish, on, a, continuous, basis, online, journal, articles, are, a, specialized, form, of, electronic, document, they, have, the, purpose, of, providing, material, for, academic, research, and, study, and, they, are, formatted, approximately, like, journal, articles, in, traditional, printed, journals, often, a, journal, article, will, be, available, for, download, in, two, formats, pdf, and, html, although, other, electronic, file, types, are, often, supported, for, supplementary, material, articles, are, indexed, in, bibliographic, databases, as, well, as, by, search, engines, e, journals, allow, new, types, of, content, to, be, included, in, journals, for, example, video, material, or, the, data, sets, on, which, research, has, been, based, with, the, growth, and, development, of, the, internet, there, has, been, a, growth, in, the, number, of, new, digital, only, journals, a, subset, of, these, journals, exist, as, open, access, titles, meaning, that, they, are, free, to, access, for, all, and, have, creative, commons, licences, which, permit, the, reproduction, of, content, in, different, ways, high, quality, open, access, journals, are, listed, in, directory, of, open, access, journals, most, however, continue, to, exist, as, subscription, journals, for, which, libraries, organisations, and, individuals, purchase, access
