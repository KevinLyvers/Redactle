origin, colour, religion, language, or, any, other, status, the, declaration, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, milestone, document, for, its, universalist, language, which, makes, no, reference, to, a, particular, culture, political, system, or, religion, it, directly, inspired, the, development, of, international, human, rights, law, and, was, the, first, step, in, the, formulation, of, the, international, bill, of, human, rights, which, was, completed, in, 1966, and, came, into, force, in, 1976, although, not, legally, binding, the, contents, of, the, udhr, have, been, elaborated, and, incorporated, into, subsequent, international, treaties, regional, human, rights, instruments, and, national, constitutions, and, legal, codes, all, 193, member, states, of, the, united, nations, have, ratified, at, least, one, of, the, nine, binding, treaties, influenced, by, the, declaration, with, the, vast, majority, ratifying, four, or, more, while, there, is, a, wide, consensus, that, the, declaration, itself, is, non, binding, and, not, part, of, customary, international, law, there, is, also, a, consensus, in, most, countries, that, many, of, its, provisions, are, part, of, customary, law, although, courts, in, some, nations, have, been, more, restrictive, on, its, legal, effect, nevertheless, the, udhr, has, influenced, legal, political, and, social, developments, on, both, the, global, and, national, levels, with, its, significance, partly, evidenced, by, its, 530, translations, the, underlying, structure, of, the, universal, declaration, was, influenced, by, the, code, napol, on, including, a, preamble, and, introductory, general, principles, its, final, structure, took, form, in, the, second, draft, prepared, by, french, jurist, ren, cassin, who, worked, on, the, initial, draft, prepared, by, canadian, legal, scholar, john, peters, humphrey, the, declaration, consists, of, the, following, cassin, compared, the, declaration, to, the, portico, of, a, greek, temple, with, a, foundation, steps, four, columns, and, a, pediment, articles, 1, and, 2, with, their, principles, of, dignity, liberty, equality, and, brotherhood, served, as, the, foundation, blocks, the, seven, paragraphs, of, the, preamble, setting, out, the, reasons, for, the, declaration, represent, the, steps, leading, up, to, the, temple, the, main, body, of, the, declaration, forms, the, four, columns, the, first, column, articles, 3, 11, constitutes, rights, of, the, individual, such, as, the, right, to, life, and, the, prohibition, of, slavery, the, second, column, articles, 12, 17, constitutes, the, rights, of, the, individual, in, civil, and, political, society, the, third, column, articles, 18, 21, is, concerned, with, spiritual, public, and, political, freedoms, such, as, freedom, of, religion, and, freedom, of, association, the, fourth, column, articles, 22, 27, sets, out, social, economic, and, cultural, rights, finally, the, last, three, articles, provide, the, pediment, which, binds, the, structure, together, as, they, emphasize, the, mutual, duties, of, every, individual, to, one, another, and, to, society, during, world, war, ii, the, allies, known, formally, as, the, united, nations, adopted, as, their, basic, war, aims, the, four, freedoms, freedom, of, speech, freedom, of, religion, freedom, from, fear, and, freedom, from, want, towards, the, end, of, the, war, the, united, nations, charter, was, debated, drafted, and, ratified, to, reaffirm, faith, in, fundamental, human, rights, and, dignity, and, worth, of, the, human, person, and, commit, all, member, states, to, promote, universal, respect, for, and, observance, of, human, rights, and, fundamental, freedoms, for, all, without, distinction, as, to, race, sex, language, or, religion, when, the, atrocities, committed, by, nazi, germany, became, fully, apparent, after, the, war, the, consensus, within, the, world, community, was, that, the, un, charter, did, not, sufficiently, define, the, rights, to, which, it, referred, it, was, deemed, necessary, to, create, a, universal, declaration, that, specified, the, rights, of, individuals, so, as, to, give, effect, to, the, charter, s, provisions, on, human, rights, in, june, 1946, the, economic, and, social, council, ecosoc, a, principal, organ, of, the, newly, founded, united, nations, that, is, responsible, for, promoting, human, rights, created, the, commission, on, human, rights, chr, a, standing, body, within, the, united, nations, that, was, tasked, with, preparing, what, was, initially, conceived, as, an, international, bill, of, rights, it, had, 18, members, from, various, national, religious, and, political, backgrounds, so, as, to, be, representative, of, humanity, in, february, 1947, the, commission, established, a, special, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, drafting, committee, chaired, by, eleanor, roosevelt, of, the, united, states, to, write, the, articles, of, the, declaration, roosevelt, in, her, position, was, key, to, the, u, s, effort, to, encourage, the, general, assembly, s, adoption, of, a, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, the, committee, met, in, two, sessions, over, the, course, of, two, years, canadian, john, peters, humphrey, the, newly, appointed, director, of, the, division, of, human, rights, within, the, united, nations, secretariat, was, called, upon, by, the, un, secretary, general, to, work, on, the, project, becoming, the, declaration, s, principal, drafter, other, prominent, members, of, the, drafting, committee, included, vice, chairman, p, c, chang, of, the, republic, of, china, ren, cassin, of, france, and, its, committee, rapporteur, charles, malik, of, lebanon, a, month, after, its, creation, the, drafting, committee, was, expanded, to, include, representatives, of, australia, chile, france, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, kingdom, in, addition, to, the, inaugural, members, from, china, france, lebanon, and, the, united, states, humphrey, is, credited, with, devising, the, blueprint, for, the, declaration, while, cassin, composed, the, first, draft, both, received, considerable, input, from, other, members, each, of, whom, reflected, different, professional, and, ideological, backgrounds, the, declaration, s, pro, family, phrases, allegedly, derived, from, cassin, and, malik, who, were, influenced, by, the, christian, democracy, movement, malik, a, christian, theologian, was, known, for, appealing, across, religious, lines, and, cited, the, summa, theologica, and, studied, the, different, christian, sects, chang, urged, removing, all, references, to, religion, to, make, the, document, more, universal, and, used, aspects, of, confucianism, to, settle, stalemates, in, negotiations, hern, n, santa, cruz, of, chile, an, educator, and, judge, strongly, supported, the, inclusion, of, socioeconomic, rights, which, had, been, opposed, by, some, western, nations, the, members, agreed, that, the, philosophical, debate, centered, between, the, opposing, opinions, of, chang, and, malik, with, malik, later, singling, out, chang, when, thanking, the, members, saying, that, there, were, too, many, to, mention, but, chang, s, ideas, impacted, his, own, opinions, in, the, making, of, the, draft, in, her, memoirs, roosevelt, commented, on, the, debates, and, discussions, that, informed, the, udhr, describing, one, such, exchange, during, the, drafting, committee, s, first, session, in, june, 1947, dr, chang, was, a, pluralist, and, held, forth, in, charming, fashion, on, the, proposition, that, there, is, more, than, one, kind, of, ultimate, reality, the, declaration, he, said, should, reflect, more, than, simply, western, ideas, and, dr, humphrey, would, have, to, be, eclectic, in, his, approach, his, remark, though, addressed, to, dr, humphrey, was, really, directed, at, dr, malik, from, whom, it, drew, a, prompt, retort, as, he, expounded, at, some, length, the, philosophy, of, thomas, aquinas, dr, humphrey, joined, enthusiastically, in, the, discussion, and, i, remember, that, at, one, point, dr, chang, suggested, that, the, secretariat, might, well, spend, a, few, months, studying, the, fundamentals, of, confucianism, in, may, 1948, roughly, a, year, after, its, creation, the, drafting, committee, held, its, second, and, final, session, where, it, considered, the, comments, and, suggestions, of, member, states, and, international, bodies, principally, the, united, nations, conference, on, freedom, of, information, which, took, place, the, prior, march, and, april, the, commission, on, the, status, of, women, a, body, within, ecosoc, that, reported, on, the, state, of, women, s, rights, worldwide, and, the, ninth, international, conference, of, american, states, held, in, bogota, colombia, from, march, to, may, 1948, which, adopted, the, south, american, based, american, declaration, of, the, rights, and, duties, of, man, the, world, s, first, general, international, human, rights, instrument, delegates, and, consultants, from, several, united, nations, bodies, international, organizations, and, nongovernmental, organizations, also, attended, and, submitted, suggestions, it, was, also, hoped, that, an, international, bill, of, human, rights, with, legal, force, could, be, drafted, and, submitted, for, adoption, alongside, the, declaration, upon, the, session, s, conclusion, on, 21, may, 1948, the, committee, submitted, to, the, commission, on, human, rights, a, redrafted, text, of, the, international, declaration, of, human, rights, and, the, international, covenant, of, human, rights, which, together, would, form, an, international, bill, of, rights, the, redrafted, declaration, was, further, examined, and, discussed, by, the, commission, on, human, rights, in, its, third, session, in, geneva, 21, may, through, 18, june, 1948, the, so, called, geneva, text, was, circulated, among, member, states, and, subject, to, several, proposed, amendments, for, example, hansa, mehta, of, india, notably, suggested, that, the, declaration, assert, that, all, human, beings, are, created, equal, instead, of, all, men, are, created, equal, to, better, reflect, gender, equality, charles, theodore, te, water, of, south, africa, fought, very, hard, to, have, the, word, dignity, removed, from, the, declaration, saying, that, dignity, had, no, universal, standard, and, that, it, was, not, a, right, te, water, believed, correctly, as, it, turned, out, that, listing, human, dignity, as, a, human, right, would, lead, to, criticism, of, the, apartheid, system, that, had, just, been, introduced, by, the, new, national, party, government, of, south, africa, malik, in, response, stated, that, prime, minister, jan, smuts, of, south, africa, had, played, an, important, role, in, drafting, the, united, nations, charter, in, 1945, and, it, was, smuts, who, inserted, the, word, dignity, as, a, human, right, into, the, charter, despite, te, water, s, efforts, the, word, dignity, was, included, in, the, declaration, as, a, human, right, with, a, vote, of, 12, in, favour, none, opposed, and, four, abstaining, the, chr, approved, the, proposed, declaration, though, was, unable, to, examine, the, contents, and, implementation, of, the, proposed, covenant, the, commission, forwarded, the, approved, text, of, the, declaration, as, well, as, the, covenant, to, the, economic, and, social, council, for, its, review, and, approval, during, its, seventh, session, in, july, and, august, 1948, the, council, adopted, resolution, 151, vii, of, 26, august, 1948, transmitting, the, draft, international, declaration, of, human, rights, to, the, un, general, assembly, the, third, committee, of, the, general, assembly, which, convened, from, 30, september, to, 7, december, 1948, during, the, third, session, of, the, united, nations, general, assembly, held, 81, meetings, concerning, the, draft, declaration, including, debating, and, resolving, 168, proposals, for, amendments, by, united, nations, member, states, on, its, 178th, meeting, on, 6, december, the, third, committee, adopted, the, declaration, with, 29, votes, in, favour, none, opposed, and, seven, abstentions, the, document, was, subsequently, submitted, to, the, wider, general, assembly, for, its, consideration, on, 9, and, 10, december, 1948, the, universal, declaration, was, adopted, by, the, general, assembly, as, un, resolution, a, res, 217, iii, on, 10, december, 1948, in, the, palais, de, chaillot, paris, of, the, 58, united, nations, members, at, the, time, 48, voted, in, favour, none, against, eight, abstained, and, honduras, and, yemen, failed, to, vote, or, abstain, eleanor, roosevelt, is, credited, with, having, been, instrumental, in, mustering, support, for, the, declaration, s, adoption, both, in, her, native, u, s, and, across, the, world, owing, to, her, ability, to, appeal, to, different, and, often, opposing, political, blocs, the, meeting, record, provides, firsthand, insight, into, the, debate, on, the, declaration, s, adoption, south, africa, s, position, can, be, seen, as, an, attempt, to, protect, its, system, of, apartheid, which, clearly, violated, several, articles, in, the, declaration, saudi, arabia, s, abstention, was, prompted, primarily, by, two, of, the, declaration, s, articles, article, 18, which, states, that, everyone, has, the, right, to, change, his, religion, or, belief, and, article, 16, on, equal, marriage, rights, the, abstentions, by, the, six, communist, nations, were, explained, by, their, claim, that, the, declaration, did, not, go, far, enough, in, condemning, fascism, and, national, socialism, however, eleanor, roosevelt, felt, that, the, reason, for, the, abstentions, was, article, 13, which, provided, the, right, of, citizens, to, leave, their, countries, other, observers, pin, the, soviet, bloc, s, opposition, to, the, declaration, s, negative, rights, such, as, provisions, calling, on, governments, not, to, violate, certain, civil, and, political, rights, the, british, delegation, while, voting, in, favour, of, the, declaration, expressed, frustration, that, the, proposed, document, had, moral, obligations, but, lacked, legal, force, it, would, not, be, until, 1976, that, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, came, into, force, giving, a, legal, status, to, most, of, the, declaration, the, 48, countries, that, voted, in, favour, of, the, declaration, are, eight, countries, abstained, two, countries, did, not, vote, current, un, member, states, particularly, in, africa, gained, sovereignty, later, or, in, europe, and, the, pacific, were, under, administration, due, to, the, recently, concluded, world, war, ii, joining, the, organization, later, which, accounts, for, the, comparatively, smaller, number, of, states, who, participated, in, the, historic, vote, 10, december, the, anniversary, of, the, adoption, of, the, universal, declaration, is, celebrated, annually, as, world, human, rights, day, or, international, human, rights, day, the, commemoration, is, observed, by, individuals, community, and, religious, groups, human, rights, organizations, parliaments, governments, and, the, united, nations, decadal, commemorations, are, often, accompanied, by, campaigns, to, promote, awareness, of, the, declaration, and, of, human, rights, in, general, 2008, marked, the, 60th, anniversary, of, the, declaration, and, was, accompanied, by, year, long, activities, around, the, theme, dignity, and, justice, for, all, of, us, likewise, the, 70th, anniversary, in, 2018, was, marked, by, the, global, standupforhumanrights, campaign, which, targeted, youth, at, the, time, of, the, declaration, s, adoption, by, the, general, assembly, in, 1948, eleanor, roosevelt, said, in, giving, our, approval, to, the, declaration, today, it, is, of, primary, importance, that, we, keep, clearly, in, mind, the, basic, character, of, the, document, it, is, not, a, treaty, it, is, not, an, international, agreement, it, is, not, and, does, not, purport, to, be, a, statement, of, law, or, of, legal, obligation, it, is, a, declaration, of, basic, principles, of, human, rights, and, freedoms, to, be, stamped, with, the, approval, of, the, general, assembly, by, formal, vote, of, its, members, and, to, serve, as, a, common, standard, of, achievement, for, all, peoples, of, all, nations, the, udhr, is, considered, groundbreaking, for, providing, a, comprehensive, and, universal, set, of, principles, in, a, secular, apolitical, document, that, explicitly, transcends, cultures, religions, legal, systems, and, political, ideologies, its, claim, to, universality, has, been, described, as, boundlessly, idealistic, and, the, most, ambitious, feature, the, declaration, was, officially, adopted, as, a, bilingual, document, in, english, and, french, with, official, translations, in, chinese, russian, and, spanish, all, of, which, are, official, working, languages, of, the, un, due, to, its, inherently, universalist, nature, the, united, nations, has, made, a, concerted, effort, to, translate, the, document, into, as, many, languages, as, possible, in, collaboration, with, private, and, public, entities, and, individuals, in, 1999, the, guinness, book, of, records, described, the, declaration, as, the, world, s, most, translated, document, with, 298, translations, the, record, was, once, again, certified, a, decade, later, when, the, text, reached, 370, different, languages, and, dialects, the, udhr, achieved, a, milestone, of, over, 500, translations, in, 2016, and, as, of, 2024, has, been, translated, into, 562, languages, remaining, the, most, translated, document, in, its, preamble, governments, commit, themselves, and, their, people, to, progressive, measures, that, secure, the, universal, and, effective, recognition, and, observance, of, the, human, rights, set, out, in, the, declaration, eleanor, roosevelt, supported, the, adoption, of, the, text, as, a, declaration, rather, than, as, a, treaty, because, she, believed, that, it, would, have, the, same, kind, of, influence, on, global, society, as, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, had, within, the, united, states, even, though, it, is, not, legally, binding, the, declaration, has, been, incorporated, into, or, influenced, most, national, constitutions, since, 1948, it, has, also, served, as, the, foundation, for, a, growing, number, of, national, laws, international, laws, and, treaties, as, well, as, for, a, growing, number, of, regional, subnational, and, national, institutions, protecting, and, promoting, human, rights, these, kinds, of, measures, focus, on, some, principles, that, regard, every, culture, community, especially, when, martial, status, take, place, or, inheritance, in, other, words, every, culture, has, its, own, norms, and, every, individual, is, allowed, to, practice, them, unless, he, she, use, them, as, a, source, of, power, the, declaration, s, all, encompassing, provisions, serve, as, a, yardstick, and, point, of, reference, by, which, countries, commitments, to, human, rights, are, judged, such, as, through, the, treaty, bodies, and, other, mechanisms, of, various, human, rights, treaties, that, monitor, implementation, in, international, law, a, declaration, is, distinct, from, a, treaty, in, that, it, generally, states, aspirations, or, understandings, among, the, parties, rather, than, binding, obligations, the, declaration, was, explicitly, adopted, to, reflect, and, elaborate, on, the, customary, international, law, reflected, in, the, fundamental, freedoms, and, human, rights, referenced, in, the, united, nations, charter, which, is, binding, on, all, member, states, for, this, reason, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, is, a, fundamental, constitutive, document, of, the, united, nations, and, by, extension, all, 193, parties, of, the, united, nations, charter, nevertheless, the, status, of, the, declaration, as, a, legally, enforceable, document, varies, widely, around, the, world, some, countries, have, incorporated, it, into, their, domestic, laws, while, other, countries, consider, it, merely, a, statement, of, ideals, with, no, binding, provisions, many, international, lawyers, believe, that, the, declaration, forms, part, of, customary, international, law, and, is, a, powerful, tool, in, applying, diplomatic, and, moral, pressure, to, governments, that, violate, its, articles, one, prominent, international, jurist, described, the, udhr, as, being, universally, regarded, as, expounding, generally, accepted, norms, other, legal, scholars, have, further, argued, that, the, declaration, constitutes, jus, cogens, fundamental, principles, of, international, law, from, which, no, state, may, deviate, or, derogate, the, 1968, united, nations, international, conference, on, human, rights, advised, that, the, declaration, constitutes, an, obligation, for, the, members, of, the, international, community, to, all, persons, the, declaration, has, served, as, the, foundation, for, two, binding, united, nations, human, rights, covenants, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, and, the, international, covenant, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, the, principles, of, the, declaration, are, elaborated, in, other, binding, international, treaties, such, as, the, international, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, racial, discrimination, the, international, convention, on, the, elimination, of, discrimination, against, women, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, the, united, nations, convention, against, torture, and, many, more, the, declaration, continues, to, be, widely, cited, by, governments, academics, advocates, and, constitutional, courts, and, by, individuals, who, appeal, to, its, principles, for, the, protection, of, their, recognized, human, rights, according, to, a, 2022, study, the, udhr, significantly, accelerated, the, adoption, of, a, particular, set, of, constitutional, rights, one, scholar, estimates, that, at, least, 90, national, constitutions, drafted, since, the, declaration, s, adoption, in, 1948, contain, statements, of, fundamental, rights, which, where, they, do, not, faithfully, reproduce, the, provisions, of, the, universal, declaration, are, at, least, inspired, by, it, at, least, 20, african, nations, that, attained, independence, in, the, decades, immediately, following, 1948, explicitly, referenced, the, udhr, in, their, constitutions, as, of, 2014, the, constitutions, that, still, directly, cite, the, declaration, are, those, of, afghanistan, benin, bosnia, herzegovina, burkina, faso, burundi, cambodia, chad, comoros, c, te, d, ivoire, equatorial, guinea, ethiopia, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, gabon, guinea, haiti, mali, mauritania, nicaragua, niger, portugal, romania, rwanda, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, senegal, somalia, spain, togo, and, yemen, moreover, the, constitutions, of, portugal, romania, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, and, spain, compel, their, courts, to, interpret, constitutional, norms, consistently, with, the, universal, declaration, judicial, and, political, figures, in, many, nations, have, directly, invoked, the, udhr, as, an, influence, or, inspiration, on, their, courts, constitutions, or, legal, codes, indian, courts, have, ruled, the, indian, constitution, most, of, the, articles, contained, in, the, declaration, nations, as, diverse, as, antigua, chad, chile, kazakhstan, saint, vincent, and, the, grenadines, and, zimbabwe, have, derived, constitutional, and, legal, provisions, from, the, declaration, in, some, cases, specific, provisions, of, the, udhr, are, incorporated, or, otherwise, reflected, in, national, law, the, right, to, health, or, to, protection, of, health, is, found, in, the, constitutions, of, belgium, kyrgyzstan, paraguay, peru, thailand, and, togo, constitutional, obligations, on, the, government, to, provide, health, services, exist, in, armenia, cambodia, ethiopia, finland, south, korea, kyrgyzstan, paraguay, thailand, and, yemen, a, survey, of, u, s, cases, through, 1988, found, five, references, to, the, declaration, by, the, united, states, supreme, court, sixteen, references, by, federal, courts, of, appeal, twenty, four, references, by, federal, district, courts, one, reference, by, a, bankruptcy, court, and, several, references, by, five, state, courts, likewise, research, conducted, in, 1994, identified, 94, references, to, the, declaration, by, federal, and, state, courts, across, the, u, s, in, 2004, the, u, s, supreme, court, ruled, in, sosa, v, alvarez, machain, that, the, declaration, does, not, of, its, own, force, impose, obligations, as, a, matter, of, international, law, and, that, the, political, branches, of, the, u, s, federal, government, can, scrutinize, the, nation, s, obligations, to, international, instruments, and, their, enforceability, however, u, s, courts, and, legislatures, may, still, use, the, declaration, to, inform, or, interpret, laws, concerned, with, human, rights, a, position, shared, by, the, courts, of, belgium, the, netherlands, india, and, sri, lanka, the, universal, declaration, has, received, praise, from, a, number, of, notable, activists, jurists, and, political, leaders, lebanese, philosopher, and, diplomat, charles, malik, called, it, an, international, document, of,

marcello, spatafora, said, that, the, declaration, placed, human, rights, at, the, centre, of, the, framework, of, principles, and, obligations, shaping, relations, within, the, international, community, as, a, pillar, of, international, human, rights, the, udhr, enjoys, widespread, support, among, international, and, nongovernmental, organizations, the, international, federation, for,

quaker, united, nations, office, and, the, american, friends, service, committee, have, developed, curriculum, or, programmes, to, educate, young, people, on, the, udhr, specific, provisions, of, the, udhr, are, cited, or, elaborated, by, interest, groups, in, relation, to, their, specific, area, of, focus, in, 1997, the, council, of, the, american, library, association, ala, endorsed, articles, 18, through, 20, concerning, freedoms, of, thought, opinion, and, expression, which, were, codified, in, the, ala, universal, right, to, free, expression, and, the, library, bill, of, rights, the, declaration, formed, the, basis, of, the, ala, s, claim, that, censorship, invasion, of, privacy, and, interference, of, opinions, are, human, rights, violations, during, the, creation, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, the, soviet, union, criticized, not, prioritizing, social, rights, over, individual, rights, and, positive, rights, over, negative, rights, enough, according, to, marxism, leninism, most, muslim, majority, countries, that, were, then, members, of, the, united, nations, signed, the, declaration, in, 1948, including, the, kingdoms, of, afghanistan, egypt, and, iraq, pahlavi, iran, and, the, first, syrian, republic, the, republic, of, turkey, which, had, an, overwhelmingly, muslim, population, but, an, officially, secular, government, also, voted, in, favour, saudi, arabia, was, the, sole, abstainer, on, the, declaration, among, muslim, majority, countries, claiming, that, it, violated, the, islamic, law, shar, a, pakistan, officially, an, islamic, state, signed, the, declaration, and, critiqued, the, saudi, position, strongly, arguing, in, favour, of, including, freedom, of, religion, as, a, fundamental, human, right, of, the, udhr, moreover, some, muslim, diplomats, would, later, help, draft, other, united, nations, human, rights, treaties, for, example, iraq, s, representative, to, the, united, nations, bedia, afnan, s, insistence, on, wording, that, recognized, gender, equality, resulted, in, article, 3, within, the, iccpr, and, icescr, which, together, with, the, udhr, form, the, international, bill, of, rights, pakistani, diplomat, shaista, suhrawardy, ikramullah, influenced, the, drafting, of, the, declaration, especially, with, respect, to, women, s, rights, and, played, a, role, in, the, preparation, of, the, 1951, genocide, convention, in, 1982, the, iranian, diplomat, to, the, united, nations, who, represented, the, country, s, newly, installed, islamic, republic, stated, that, the, declaration, was, a, secular, understanding, of, the, judeo, christian, tradition, that, could, not, be, implemented, by, muslims, without, conflict, with, shar, a, law, on, 30, june, 2000, member, states, of, the, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, which, represents, most, of, the, muslim, world, officially, resolved, to, support, the, cairo, declaration, on, human, rights, in, islam, an, alternative, document, that, says, people, have, freedom, and, right, to, a, dignified, life, in, accordance, with, the, islamic, shari, ah, without, any, discrimination, on, grounds, of, race, colour, language, sex, religious, belief, political, affiliation, social, status, or, other, considerations, the, cairo, declaration, is, widely, acknowledged, to, be, a, response, to, the, udhr, and, uses, similar, universalist, language, albeit, derived, solely, from, islamic, jurisprudence, fiqh, regarding, the, promulgation, of, the, cairo, declaration, on, human, rights, in, islam, t, jeremy, gunn, professor, of, law, and, political, science, at, the, international, university, of, rabat, in, morocco, has, stated, the, twenty, two, member, league, of, arab, states, arab, league, each, of, whose, members, also, belongs, to, the, oic, and, is, majority, muslim, created, its, own, human, rights, instruments, and, institutions, based, in, cairo, that, set, it, apart, from, the, international, human, rights, regime, while, the, term, arab, denotes, an, ethnicity, and, muslim, references, a, religion, all, majority, arab, countries, are, also, majority, muslim, countries, though, the, opposite, does, not, hold, indeed, the, preponderance, of, muslim, majority, countries, is, not, arab, it, has, long, been, recognized, that, the, muslim, majority, arab, world, ranks, particularly, poorly, with, respect, to, human, rights, according, to, the, 2009, arab, human, development, report, written, by, arab, experts, for, the, united, nations, development, programme, regional, bureau, for, arab, states, arab, states, seem, content, to, ratify, certain, international, human, rights, treaties, but, do, not, go, so, far, as, to, recognize, the, role, of, international, mechanisms, in, making, human, rights, effective, the, resistance, to, implementation, of, international, human, rights, standards, in, parts, of, the, muslim, and, arab, worlds, is, perhaps, most, salient, with, the, panoply, of, rights, related, to, religion, in, terms, of, the, udhr, the, core, of, the, resistance, is, centered, on, issues, of, the, right, to, freedom, of, thought, conscience, and, religion, article, 18, prohibition, of, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, religion, article, 2, and, the, prohibition, of, discrimination, against, women, preamble, article, 2, article, 16, the, same, resistance, to, universal, standards, already, present, in, the, udhr, continued, in, subsequent, elaborations, of, human, rights, including, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, iccpr, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, and, the, 1981, declaration, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, intolerance, and, of, discrimination, based, on, religion, or, belief, a, number, of, scholars, in, different, fields, have, expressed, concerns, with, the, declaration, s, alleged, western, and, secularist, bias, abdulaziz, sachedina, observes, that, muslims, broadly, agree, with, the, declaration, s, universalist, premise, which, is, shared, by, islam, but, differ, on, specific, contents, which, many, find, insensitive, to, particular, muslim, cultural, values, especially, when, it, comes, to, speaking, about, individual, rights, in, the, context, of, collective, and, family, values, in, muslim, society, 50, 51, however, he, notes, that, most, muslim, scholars, while, opposing, the, inherently, secular, framework, of, the, document, do, respect, and, acknowledge, some, of, its, foundations, 50, 51, sachedina, further, argues, that, many, christians, similarly, criticized, the, declaration, for, allegedly, reflecting, a, secular, and, liberal, bias, in, opposition, to, certain, religious, values, 50, 51, kazakh, religious, scholars, galym, zhussipbek, and, zhanar, nagayeva, have, argued, that, the, rejection, or, failed, implementation, of, human, rights, in, muslim, majority, countries, and, their, seeming, incompatibility, with, shar, a, law, originates, from, the, current, epistemological, crisis, of, conservative, islamic, scholarship, and, muslim, mind, rooted, in, the, centuries, old, confinement, of, a, role, for, reason, within, strict, limits, and, in, the, disappearance, of, rationalistic, discursive, islamic, theology, kal, m, as, a, dynamic, science, from, the, muslim, world, furthermore, they, affirm, the, necessity, of, undertaking, an, epistemological, reform, in, islamic, scholarship, which, denotes, the, incorporation, of, international, standards, of, human, rights, and, justice, into, the, epistemology, and, methodology, of, islamic, jurisprudence, usul, al, fiqh, riffat, hassan, a, pakistani, born, american, islamic, feminist, scholar, and, muslim, theologian, has, argued, what, needs, to, be, pointed, out, to, those, who, uphold, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, to, be, the, highest, or, sole, model, of, a, charter, of, equality, and, liberty, for, all, human, beings, is, that, given, the, western, origin, and, orientation, of, this, declaration, the, universality, of, the, assumptions, on, which, it, is, based, is, at, the, very, least, problematic, and, subject, to, questioning, furthermore, the, alleged, incompatibility, between, the, concept, of, human, rights, and, religion, in, general, or, particular, religions, such, as, islam, needs, to, be, examined, in, an, unbiased, way, faisal, kutty, a, muslim, canadian, human, rights, activist, opines, that, a, strong, argument, can, be, made, that, the, current, formulation, of, international, human, rights, constitutes, a, cultural, structure, in, which, western, society, finds, itself, easily, at, home, it, is, important, to, acknowledge, and, appreciate, that, other, societies, may, have, equally, valid, alternative, conceptions, of, human, rights, irene, oh, director, of, the, peace, studies, programme, at, georgetown, university, has, argued, that, muslim, reservations, towards, some, provisions, of, the, udhr, and, the, broader, debate, about, the, document, s, secular, and, western, bias, could, be, resolved, through, mutual, dialogue, grounded, in, comparative, descriptive, ethics, groups, such, as, amnesty, international, and, war, resisters, international, have, advocated, for, the, right, to, refuse, to, kill, to, be, added, to, the, universal, declaration, as, has, se, n, macbride, a, former, assistant, secretary, general, of, the, united, nations, and, nobel, peace, prize, laureate, war, resisters, international, has, stated, that, the, right, to, conscientious, objection, to, military, service, is, primarily, derived, from, article, 18, of, the, udhr, which, preserves, the, right, to, freedom, of, thought, conscience, and, religion, some, steps, have, been, taken, within, the, un, to, make, the, right, more, explicit, with, the, human, rights, council, repeatedly, affirming, that, article, 18, enshrines, the, right, of, everyone, to, have, conscientious, objection, to, military, service, as, a, legitimate, exercise, of, the, right, to, freedom, of, thought, conscience, and, religion, the, american, anthropological, association, criticized, the, udhr, during, its, drafting, process, warning, that, its, definition, of, universal, rights, reflected, a, western, paradigm, that, was, unfair, to, non, western, nations, they, further, argued, that, the, west, s, history, of, colonialism, and, evangelism, made, them, a, problematic, moral, representative, for, the, rest, of, the, world, they, proposed, three, notes, for, consideration, with, underlying, themes, of, cultural, relativism, during, the, lead, up, to, the, world, conference, on, human, rights, that, was, held, in, 1993, ministers, from, several, asian, states, adopted, the, bangkok, declaration, which, reaffirms, their, governments, commitment, to, the, principles, of, the, united, nations, charter, and, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, they, stated, their, belief, that, human, rights, are, interdependent, and, indivisible, and, stressed, the, need, for, universality, objectivity, and, non, selectivity, of, human, rights, however, at, the, same, time, they, emphasized, the, principles, of, sovereignty, and, non, interference, calling, for, greater, emphasis, upon, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, and, in, particular, the, right, to, economic, development, by, establishing, international, collaboration, directives, between, the, signatories, the, bangkok, declaration, is, considered, to, be, a, landmark, expression, of, asian, values, with, respect, to, human, rights, which, offers, an, extended, critique, of, human, rights, universalism
