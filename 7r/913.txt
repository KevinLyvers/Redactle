historically, cavalry, from, the, french, word, cavalerie, itself, derived, from, cheval, meaning, horse, are, groups, of, soldiers, or, warriors, who, fight, mounted, on, horseback, until, the, 20th, century, cavalry, were, the, most, mobile, of, the, combat, arms, operating, as, light, cavalry, in, the, roles, of, reconnaissance, screening, and, skirmishing, or, as, heavy, cavalry, for, decisive, economy, of, force, and, shock, attacks, an, individual, soldier, in, the, cavalry, is, known, by, a, number, of, designations, depending, on, era, and, tactics, such, as, a, cavalryman, horseman, trooper, cataphract, knight, drabant, hussar, uhlan, mamluk, cuirassier, lancer, dragoon, samurai, or, horse, archer, the, designation, of, cavalry, was, not, usually, given, to, any, military, forces, that, used, other, animals, or, platforms, for, mounts, such, as, chariots, camels, or, elephants, infantry, who, moved, on, horseback, but, dismounted, to, fight, on, foot, were, known, in, the, early, 17th, to, the, early, 18th, century, as, dragoons, a, class, of, mounted, infantry, which, in, most, armies, later, evolved, into, standard, cavalry, while, retaining, their, historic, designation, cavalry, had, the, advantage, of, improved, mobility, and, a, soldier, fighting, from, horseback, also, had, the, advantages, of, greater, height, speed, and, inertial, mass, over, an, opponent, on, foot, another, element, of, horse, mounted, warfare, is, the, psychological, impact, a, mounted, soldier, can, inflict, on, an, opponent, the, speed, mobility, and, shock, value, of, cavalry, was, greatly, valued, and, exploited, in, warfare, during, the, ancient, and, medieval, eras, some, hosts, were, mostly, cavalry, particularly, in, nomadic, societies, of, asia, notably, the, huns, of, attila, and, the, later, mongol, armies, in, europe, cavalry, became, increasingly, armoured, heavy, and, eventually, evolving, into, the, mounted, knights, of, the, medieval, period, during, the, 17th, century, cavalry, in, europe, discarded, most, of, its, armor, which, was, ineffective, against, the, muskets, and, cannons, that, were, coming, into, common, use, and, by, the, mid, 18th, century, armor, had, mainly, fallen, into, obsolescence, although, some, regiments, retained, a, small, thickened, cuirass, that, offered, protection, against, lances, sabres, and, bayonets, including, some, protection, against, a, shot, from, distance, in, the, interwar, period, many, cavalry, units, were, converted, into, motorized, infantry, and, mechanized, infantry, units, or, reformed, as, tank, troops, the, cavalry, tank, or, cruiser, tank, was, one, designed, with, a, speed, and, purpose, beyond, that, of, infantry, tanks, and, would, subsequently, develop, into, the, main, battle, tank, nonetheless, some, cavalry, still, served, during, world, war, ii, notably, in, the, red, army, the, mongolian, people, s, army, the, royal, italian, army, the, royal, hungarian, army, the, romanian, army, the, polish, land, forces, and, german, light, reconnaissance, units, within, the, waffen, ss, most, cavalry, units, that, are, horse, mounted, in, modern, armies, serve, in, purely, ceremonial, roles, or, as, mounted, infantry, in, difficult, terrain, such, as, mountains, or, heavily, forested, areas, modern, usage, of, the, term, generally, refers, to, units, performing, the, role, of, reconnaissance, surveillance, and, target, acquisition, analogous, to, historical, light, cavalry, or, main, battle, tank, units, analogous, to, historical, heavy, cavalry, historically, cavalry, was, divided, into, light, cavalry, and, heavy, cavalry, the, differences, were, their, roles, in, combat, the, size, of, their, mounts, and, how, much, armor, was, worn, by, the, mount, and, rider, heavy, cavalry, such, as, byzantine, cataphracts, and, knights, of, the, early, middle, ages, in, europe, were, used, as, shock, troops, charging, the, main, body, of, the, enemy, at, the, height, of, a, battle, in, many, cases, their, actions, decided, the, outcome, of, the, battle, hence, the, later, term, battle, cavalry, light, cavalry, such, as, horse, archers, hussars, and, cossack, cavalry, were, assigned, all, the, numerous, roles, that, were, ill, suited, to, more, narrowly, focused, heavy, forces, this, includes, scouting, deterring, enemy, scouts, foraging, raiding, skirmishing, pursuit, of, retreating, enemy, forces, screening, of, retreating, friendly, forces, linking, separated, friendly, forces, and, countering, enemy, light, forces, in, all, these, same, roles, light, and, heavy, cavalry, roles, continued, through, early, modern, warfare, but, armor, was, reduced, with, light, cavalry, mostly, unarmored, yet, many, cavalry, units, still, retained, cuirasses, and, helmets, for, their, protective, value, against, sword, and, bayonet, strikes, and, the, morale, boost, these, provide, to, the, wearers, despite, the, actual, armour, giving, little, protection, from, firearms, by, this, time, the, main, difference, between, light, and, heavy, cavalry, was, in, their, training, and, weight, the, former, was, regarded, as, best, suited, for, harassment, and, reconnaissance, while, the, latter, was, considered, best, for, close, order, charges, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, as, total, battlefield, firepower, increased, cavalry, increasingly, tended, to, become, dragoons, in, practice, riding, mounted, between, battles, but, dismounting, to, fight, as, infantry, even, though, retaining, unit, names, that, reflected, their, older, cavalry, roles, military, conservatism, was, however, strong, in, most, continental, cavalry, during, peacetime, and, in, these, dismounted, action, continued, to, be, regarded, as, a, secondary, function, until, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, with, the, development, of, armored, warfare, the, heavy, cavalry, role, of, decisive, shock, troops, had, been, taken, over, by, armored, units, employing, medium, and, heavy, tanks, and, later, main, battle, tanks, despite, horse, borne, cavalry, becoming, obsolete, the, term, cavalry, is, still, used, referring, in, modern, times, to, units, continuing, to, fulfill, the, traditional, light, cavalry, roles, employing, fast, armored, cars, light, tanks, and, infantry, fighting, vehicles, instead, of, horses, while, air, cavalry, employs, helicopters, before, the, iron, age, the, role, of, cavalry, on, the, battlefield, was, largely, performed, by, light, chariots, the, chariot, originated, with, the, sintashta, petrovka, culture, in, central, asia, and, spread, by, nomadic, or, semi, nomadic, indo, iranians, the, chariot, was, quickly, adopted, by, settled, peoples, both, as, a, military, technology, and, an, object, of, ceremonial, status, especially, by, the, pharaohs, of, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, from, 1550, bc, as, well, as, the, assyrian, army, and, babylonian, royalty, the, power, of, mobility, given, by, mounted, units, was, recognized, early, on, but, was, offset, by, the, difficulty, of, raising, large, forces, and, by, the, inability, of, horses, then, mostly, small, to, carry, heavy, armor, nonetheless, there, are, indications, that, from, the, 15th, century, bc, onwards, horseback, riding, was, practiced, amongst, the, military, elites, of, the, great, states, of, the, ancient, near, east, most, notably, those, in, egypt, assyria, the, hittite, empire, and, mycenaean, greece, cavalry, techniques, and, the, rise, of, true, cavalry, were, an, innovation, of, equestrian, nomads, of, the, eurasian, steppe, and, pastoralist, tribes, such, as, the, iranic, parthians, and, sarmatians, together, with, a, core, of, armoured, lancers, these, were, predominantly, horse, archers, using, the, parthian, shot, tactic, the, photograph, straight, above, shows, assyrian, cavalry, from, reliefs, of, 865, 860, bc, at, this, time, the, men, had, no, spurs, saddles, saddle, cloths, or, stirrups, fighting, from, the, back, of, a, horse, was, much, more, difficult, than, mere, riding, the, cavalry, acted, in, pairs, the, reins, of, the, mounted, archer, were, controlled, by, his, neighbour, s, hand, even, at, this, early, time, cavalry, used, swords, shields, spears, and, bows, the, sculpture, implies, two, types, of, cavalry, but, this, might, be, a, simplification, by, the, artist, later, images, of, assyrian, cavalry, show, saddle, cloths, as, primitive, saddles, allowing, each, archer, to, control, his, own, horse, as, early, as, 490, bc, a, breed, of, large, horses, was, bred, in, the, nisaean, plain, in, media, to, carry, men, with, increasing, amounts, of, armour, herodotus, 7, 40, 9, 20, but, large, horses, were, still, very, exceptional, at, this, time, by, the, fourth, century, bc, the, chinese, during, the, warring, states, period, 403, 221, bc, began, to, use, cavalry, against, rival, states, and, by, 331, bc, when, alexander, the, great, defeated, the, persians, the, use, of, chariots, in, battle, was, obsolete, in, most, nations, despite, a, few, ineffective, attempts, to, revive, scythed, chariots, the, last, recorded, use, of, chariots, as, a, shock, force, in, continental, europe, was, during, the, battle, of, telamon, in, 225, bc, however, chariots, remained, in, use, for, ceremonial, purposes, such, as, carrying, the, victorious, general, in, a, roman, triumph, or, for, racing, outside, of, mainland, europe, the, southern, britons, met, julius, caesar, with, chariots, in, 55, and, 54, bc, but, by, the, time, of, the, roman, conquest, of, britain, a, century, later, chariots, were, obsolete, even, in, britannia, the, last, mention, of, chariot, use, in, britain, was, by, the, caledonians, at, the, mons, graupius, in, 84, ad, during, the, classical, greek, period, cavalry, were, usually, limited, to, those, citizens, who, could, afford, expensive, war, horses, three, types, of, cavalry, became, common, light, cavalry, whose, riders, armed, with, javelins, could, harass, and, skirmish, heavy, cavalry, whose, troopers, using, lances, had, the, ability, to, close, in, on, their, opponents, and, finally, those, whose, equipment, allowed, them, to, fight, either, on, horseback, or, foot, the, role, of, horsemen, did, however, remain, secondary, to, that, of, the, hoplites, or, heavy, infantry, who, comprised, the, main, strength, of, the, citizen, levies, of, the, various, city, states, cavalry, played, a, relatively, minor, role, in, ancient, greek, city, states, with, conflicts, decided, by, massed, armored, infantry, however, thebes, produced, pelopidas, their, first, great, cavalry, commander, whose, tactics, and, skills, were, absorbed, by, philip, ii, of, macedon, when, philip, was, a, guest, hostage, in, thebes, thessaly, was, widely, known, for, producing, competent, cavalrymen, and, later, experiences, in, wars, both, with, and, against, the, persians, taught, the, greeks, the, value, of, cavalry, in, skirmishing, and, pursuit, the, athenian, author, and, soldier, xenophon, in, particular, advocated, the, creation, of, a, small, but, well, trained, cavalry, force, to, that, end, he, wrote, several, manuals, on, horsemanship, and, cavalry, operations, the, macedonian, kingdom, in, the, north, on, the, other, hand, developed, a, strong, cavalry, force, that, culminated, in, the, hetairoi, companion, cavalry, of, philip, ii, of, macedon, and, alexander, the, great, in, addition, to, these, heavy, cavalry, the, macedonian, army, also, employed, lighter, horsemen, called, prodromoi, for, scouting, and, screening, as, well, as, the, macedonian, pike, phalanx, and, various, kinds, of, light, infantry, there, were, also, the, ippiko, or, horserider, greek, heavy, cavalry, armed, with, kontos, or, cavalry, lance, and, sword, these, wore, leather, armour, or, mail, plus, a, helmet, they, were, medium, rather, than, heavy, cavalry, meaning, that, they, were, better, suited, to, be, scouts, skirmishers, and, pursuers, rather, than, front, line, fighters, the, effectiveness, of, this, combination, of, cavalry, and, infantry, helped, to, break, enemy, lines, and, was, most, dramatically, demonstrated, in, alexander, s, conquests, of, persia, bactria, and, northwestern, india, the, cavalry, in, the, early, roman, republic, remained, the, preserve, of, the, wealthy, landed, class, known, as, the, equites, men, who, could, afford, the, expense, of, maintaining, a, horse, in, addition, to, arms, and, armor, heavier, than, those, of, the, common, legions, horses, were, provided, by, the, republic, and, could, be, withdrawn, if, neglected, or, misused, together, with, the, status, of, being, a, cavalryman, as, the, class, grew, to, be, more, of, a, social, elite, instead, of, a, functional, property, based, military, grouping, the, romans, began, to, employ, italian, socii, for, filling, the, ranks, of, their, cavalry, the, weakness, of, roman, cavalry, was, demonstrated, by, hannibal, barca, during, the, second, punic, war, where, he, used, his, superior, mounted, forces, to, win, several, battles, the, most, notable, of, these, was, the, battle, of, cannae, where, he, inflicted, a, catastrophic, defeat, on, the, romans, at, about, the, same, time, the, romans, began, to, recruit, foreign, auxiliary, cavalry, from, among, gauls, iberians, and, numidians, the, last, being, highly, valued, as, mounted, skirmishers, and, scouts, see, numidian, cavalry, julius, caesar, had, a, high, opinion, of, his, escort, of, germanic, mixed, cavalry, giving, rise, to, the, cohortes, equitatae, early, emperors, maintained, an, ala, of, batavian, cavalry, as, their, personal, bodyguards, until, the, unit, was, dismissed, by, galba, after, the, batavian, rebellion, for, the, most, part, roman, cavalry, during, the, early, republic, functioned, as, an, adjunct, to, the, legionary, infantry, and, formed, only, one, fifth, of, the, standing, force, comprising, a, consular, army, except, in, times, of, major, mobilisation, about, 1, 800, horsemen, were, maintained, with, three, hundred, attached, to, each, legion, the, relatively, low, ratio, of, horsemen, to, infantry, does, not, mean, that, the, utility, of, cavalry, should, be, underestimated, as, its, strategic, role, in, scouting, skirmishing, and, outpost, duties, was, crucial, to, the, romans, capability, to, conduct, operations, over, long, distances, in, hostile, or, unfamiliar, territory, on, some, occasions, roman, cavalry, also, proved, its, ability, to, strike, a, decisive, tactical, blow, against, a, weakened, or, unprepared, enemy, such, as, the, final, charge, at, the, battle, of, aquilonia, after, defeats, such, as, the, battle, of, carrhae, the, romans, learned, the, importance, of, large, cavalry, formations, from, the, parthians, at, the, same, time, heavy, spears, and, shields, modelled, on, those, favoured, by, the, horsemen, of, the, greek, city, states, were, adopted, to, replace, the, lighter, weaponry, of, early, rome, these, improvements, in, tactics, and, equipment, reflected, those, of, a, thousand, years, earlier, when, the, first, iranians, to, reach, the, iranian, plateau, forced, the, assyrians, to, undertake, similar, reform, nonetheless, the, romans, would, continue, to, rely, mainly, on, their, heavy, infantry, supported, by, auxiliary, cavalry, in, the, army, of, the, late, roman, empire, cavalry, played, an, increasingly, important, role, the, spatha, the, classical, sword, throughout, most, of, the, 1st, millennium, was, adopted, as, the, standard, model, for, the, empire, s, cavalry, forces, by, the, 6th, century, these, had, evolved, into, lengthy, straight, weapons, influenced, by, persian, and, other, eastern, patterns, other, specialist, weapons, during, this, period, included, javlins, long, reaching, lancers, axes, and, maces, the, most, widespread, employment, of, heavy, cavalry, at, this, time, was, found, in, the, forces, of, the, iranian, empires, the, parthians, and, their, persian, sasanian, successors, both, but, especially, the, former, were, famed, for, the, cataphract, fully, armored, cavalry, armed, with, lances, even, though, the, majority, of, their, forces, consisted, of, lighter, horse, archers, the, west, first, encountered, this, eastern, heavy, cavalry, during, the, hellenistic, period, with, further, intensive, contacts, during, the, eight, centuries, of, the, roman, persian, wars, at, first, the, parthians, mobility, greatly, confounded, the, romans, whose, armoured, close, order, infantry, proved, unable, to, match, the, speed, of, the, parthians, however, later, the, romans, would, successfully, adapt, such, heavy, armor, and, cavalry, tactics, by, creating, their, own, units, of, cataphracts, and, clibanarii, the, decline, of, the, roman, infrastructure, made, it, more, difficult, to, field, large, infantry, forces, and, during, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, cavalry, began, to, take, a, more, dominant, role, on, the, european, battlefield, also, in, part, made, possible, by, the, appearance, of, new, larger, breeds, of, horses, the, replacement, of, the, roman, saddle, by, variants, on, the, scythian, model, with, pommel, and, cantle, was, also, a, significant, factor, as, was, the, adoption, of, stirrups, and, the, concomitant, increase, in, stability, of, the, rider, s, seat, armored, cataphracts, began, to, be, deployed, in, eastern, europe, and, the, near, east, following, the, precedents, established, by, persian, forces, as, the, main, striking, force, of, the, armies, in, contrast, to, the, earlier, roles, of, cavalry, as, scouts, raiders, and, outflankers, the, late, roman, cavalry, tradition, of, organized, units, in, a, standing, army, differed, fundamentally, from, the, nobility, of, the, germanic, invaders, individual, warriors, who, could, afford, to, provide, their, own, horses, and, equipment, while, there, was, no, direct, linkage, with, these, predecessors, the, early, medieval, knight, also, developed, as, a, member, of, a, social, and, martial, elite, able, to, meet, the, considerable, expenses, required, by, his, role, from, grants, of, land, and, other, incomes, xiongnu, tujue, avars, kipchaks, khitans, mongols, don, cossacks, and, the, various, turkic, peoples, are, also, examples, of, the, horse, mounted, groups, that, managed, to, gain, substantial, successes, in, military, conflicts, with, settled, agrarian, and, urban, societies, due, to, their, strategic, and, tactical, mobility, as, european, states, began, to, assume, the, character, of, bureaucratic, nation, states, supporting, professional, standing, armies, recruitment, of, these, mounted, warriors, was, undertaken, in, order, to, fill, the, strategic, roles, of, scouts, and, raiders, the, best, known, instance, of, the, continued, employment, of, mounted, tribal, auxiliaries, were, the, cossack, cavalry, regiments, of, the, russian, empire, in, eastern, europe, and, out, onto, the, steppes, cavalry, remained, important, much, longer, and, dominated, the, scene, of, warfare, until, the, early, 17th, century, and, even, beyond, as, the, strategic, mobility, of, cavalry, was, crucial, for, the, semi, nomadic, pastoralist, lives, that, many, steppe, cultures, led, tibetans, also, had, a, tradition, of, cavalry, warfare, in, several, military, engagements, with, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ad, further, east, the, military, history, of, china, specifically, northern, china, held, a, long, tradition, of, intense, military, exchange, between, han, chinese, infantry, forces, of, the, settled, dynastic, empires, and, the, mounted, nomads, or, barbarians, of, the, north, the, naval, history, of, china, was, centered, more, to, the, south, where, mountains, rivers, and, large, lakes, necessitated, the, employment, of, a, large, and, well, kept, navy, in, 307, bc, king, wuling, of, zhao, the, ruler, of, the, former, state, of, jin, ordered, his, commanders, and, troops, to, adopt, the, trousers, of, the, nomads, as, well, as, practice, the, nomads, form, of, mounted, archery, to, hone, their, new, cavalry, skills, the, adoption, of, massed, cavalry, in, china, also, broke, the, tradition, of, the, chariot, riding, chinese, aristocracy, in, battle, which, had, been, in, use, since, the, ancient, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, 1050, bc, by, this, time, large, chinese, infantry, based, armies, of, 100, 000, to, 200, 000, troops, were, now, buttressed, with, several, hundred, thousand, mounted, cavalry, in, support, or, as, an, effective, striking, force, the, handheld, pistol, and, trigger, crossbow, was, invented, in, china, in, the, fourth, century, bc, it, was, written, by, the, song, dynasty, scholars, zeng, gongliang, ding, du, and, yang, weide, in, their, book, wujing, zongyao, 1044, ad, that, massed, missile, fire, by, crossbowmen, was, the, most, effective, defense, against, enemy, cavalry, charges, on, many, occasions, the, chinese, studied, nomadic, cavalry, tactics, and, applied, the, lessons, in, creating, their, own, potent, cavalry, forces, while, in, others, they, simply, recruited, the, tribal, horsemen, wholesale, into, their, armies, and, in, yet, other, cases, nomadic, empires, proved, eager, to, enlist, chinese, infantry, and, engineering, as, in, the, case, of, the, mongol, empire, and, its, sinicized, part, the, yuan, dynasty, 1279, 1368, the, chinese, recognized, early, on, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, that, they, were, at, a, disadvantage, in, lacking, the, number, of, horses, the, northern, nomadic, peoples, mustered, in, their, armies, emperor, wu, of, han, r, 141, 87, bc, went, to, war, with, the, dayuan, for, this, reason, since, the, dayuan, were, hoarding, a, massive, amount, of, tall, strong, central, asian, bred, horses, in, the, hellenized, greek, region, of, fergana, established, slightly, earlier, by, alexander, the, great, although, experiencing, some, defeats, early, on, in, the, campaign, emperor, wu, s, war, from, 104, bc, to, 102, bc, succeeded, in, gathering, the, prized, tribute, of, horses, from, fergana, cavalry, tactics, in, china, were, enhanced, by, the, invention, of, the, saddle, attached, stirrup, by, at, least, the, 4th, century, as, the, oldest, reliable, depiction, of, a, rider, with, paired, stirrups, was, found, in, a, jin, dynasty, tomb, of, the, year, 322, ad, the, chinese, invention, of, the, horse, collar, by, the, 5th, century, was, also, a, great, improvement, from, the, breast, harness, allowing, the, horse, to, haul, greater, weight, without, heavy, burden, on, its, skeletal, structure, the, horse, warfare, of, korea, was, first, started, during, the, ancient, korean, kingdom, gojoseon, since, at, least, the, 3rd, century, bc, there, was, influence, of, northern, nomadic, peoples, and, yemaek, peoples, on, korean, warfare, by, roughly, the, first, century, bc, the, ancient, kingdom, of, buyeo, also, had, mounted, warriors, the, cavalry, of, goguryeo, one, of, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, were, called, gaemamusa, and, were, renowned, as, a, fearsome, heavy, cavalry, force, king, gwanggaeto, the, great, often, led, expeditions, into, the, baekje, gaya, confederacy, buyeo, later, yan, and, against, japanese, invaders, with, his, cavalry, in, the, 12th, century, jurchen, tribes, began, to, violate, the, goryeo, jurchen, borders, and, eventually, invaded, goryeo, korea, after, experiencing, invasion, by, the, jurchen, korean, general, yun, kwan, realized, that, goryeo, lacked, efficient, cavalry, units, he, reorganized, the, goryeo, military, into, a, professional, army, that, would, contain, decent, and, well, trained, cavalry, units, in, 1107, the, jurchen, were, ultimately, defeated, and, surrendered, to, yun, kwan, to, mark, the, victory, general, yun, built, nine, fortresses, to, the, northeast, of, the, goryeo, jurchen, borders, 9, the, ancient, japanese, of, the, kofun, period, also, adopted, cavalry, and, equine, culture, by, the, 5th, century, ad, the, emergence, of, the, samurai, aristocracy, led, to, the, development, of, armoured, horse, archers, themselves, to, develop, into, charging, lancer, cavalry, as, gunpowder, weapons, rendered, bows, obsolete, japanese, cavalry, was, largely, made, up, of, landowners, who, would, be, upon, a, horse, to, better, survey, the, troops, they, were, called, upon, to, bring, to, an, engagement, rather, than, traditional, mounted, warfare, seen, in, other, cultures, with, massed, cavalry, units, an, example, is, yabusame, a, type, of, mounted, archery, in, traditional, japanese, archery, an, archer, on, a, running, horse, shoots, three, special, turnip, headed, arrows, successively, at, three, wooden, targets, this, style, of, archery, has, its, origins, at, the, beginning, of, the, kamakura, period, minamoto, no, yoritomo, became, alarmed, at, the, lack, of, archery, skills, his, samurai, had, he, organized, yabusame, as, a, form, of, practice, currently, the, best, places, to, see, yabusame, performed, are, at, the, tsurugaoka, hachiman, g, in, kamakura, and, shimogamo, shrine, in, kyoto, during, aoi, matsuri, in, early, may, it, is, also, performed, in, samukawa, and, on, the, beach, at, zushi, as, well, as, other, locations, kasagake, or, kasakake, lit, hat, shooting, is, a, type, of, japanese, mounted, archery, in, contrast, to, yabusame, the, types, of, targets, are, various, and, the, archer, shoots, without, stopping, the, horse, while, yabusame, has, been, played, as, a, part, of, formal, ceremonies, kasagake, has, developed, as, a, game, or, practice, of, martial, arts, focusing, on, technical, elements, of, horse, archery, in, the, indian, subcontinent, cavalry, played, a, major, role, from, the, gupta, dynasty, 320, 600, period, onwards, india, has, also, the, oldest, evidence, for, the, introduction, of, toe, stirrups, indian, literature, contains,

supplementary, cavalry, or, dakhilis, were, recruited, equipped, and, paid, by, the, central, state, this, was, in, contrast, to, the, tabinan, horsemen, who, were, the, followers, of, individual, noblemen, their, training, and, equipment, varied, widely, but, they, made, up, the, backbone, of, the, mughal, cavalry, finally, there, were, tribal, irregulars, led, by, and, loyal, to, tributary, chiefs, these, included, hindus, afghans, and, turks, summoned, for, military, service, when, their, autonomous, leaders, were, called, on, by, the, imperial, government, as, the, quality, and, availability, of, heavy, infantry, declined, in, europe, with, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, heavy, cavalry, became, more, effective, infantry, that, lack, the, cohesion, and, discipline, of, tight, formations, are, more, susceptible, to, being, broken, and, scattered, by, shock, combat, the, main, role, of, heavy, cavalry, which, rose, to, become, the, dominant, force, on, the, european, battlefield, as, heavy, cavalry, increased, in, importance, it, became, the, main, focus, of, military, development, the, arms, and, armour, for, heavy, cavalry, increased, the, high, backed, saddle, developed, and, stirrups, and, spurs, were, added, increasing, the, advantage, of, heavy, cavalry, even, more, this, shift, in, military, importance, was, reflected, in, an, increasingly, hierarchical, society, as, well, from, the, late, 10th, century, onwards, heavily, armed, horsemen, milites, or, knights, emerged, as, an, expensive, elite, taking, centre, stage, both, on, and, off, the, battlefield, this, class, of, aristocratic, warriors, was, considered, the, ultimate, in, heavy, cavalry, well, equipped, with, the, best, weapons, state, of, the, art, armour, from, head, to, foot, leading, with, the, lance, in, battle, in, a, full, gallop, close, formation, knightly, charge, that, might, prove, irresistible, winning, the, battle, almost, as, soon, as, it, began, but, knights, remained, the, minority, of, total, available, combat, forces, the, expense, of, arms, armour, and, horses, was, only, affordable, to, a, select, few, while, mounted, men, at, arms, focused, on, a, narrow, combat, role, of, shock, combat, medieval, armies, relied, on, a, large, variety, of, foot, troops, to, fulfill, all, the, rest, skirmishing, flank, guards, scouting, holding, ground, etc, medieval, chroniclers, tended, to, pay, undue, attention, to, the, knights, at, the, expense, of, the, common, soldiers, which, led, early, students, of, military, history, to, suppose, that, heavy, cavalry, was, the, only, force, that, mattered, on, medieval, european, battlefields, but, well, trained, and, disciplined, infantry, could, defeat, knights, massed, english, longbowmen, triumphed, over, french, cavalry, at, cr, cy, poitiers, and, agincourt, while, at, gisors, 1188, bannockburn, 1314, and, laupen, 1339, foot, soldiers, proved, they, could, resist, cavalry, charges, as, long, as, they, held, their, formation, once, the, swiss, developed, their, pike, squares, for, offensive, as, well, as, defensive, use, infantry, started, to, become, the, principal, arm, this, aggressive, new, doctrine, gave, the, swiss, victory, over, a, range, of, adversaries, and, their, enemies, found, that, the, only, reliable, way, to, defeat, them, was, by, the, use, of, an, even, more, comprehensive, combined, arms, doctrine, as, evidenced, in, the, battle, of, marignano, the, introduction, of, missile, weapons, that, required, less, skill, than, the, longbow, such, as, the, crossbow, and, hand, cannon, also, helped, remove, the, focus, somewhat, from, cavalry, elites, to, masses, of, cheap, infantry, equipped, with, easy, to, learn, weapons, these, missile, weapons, were, very, successfully, used, in, the, hussite, wars, in, combination, with, wagenburg, tactics, this, gradual, rise, in, the, dominance, of, infantry, led, to, the, adoption, of, dismounted, tactics, from, the, earliest, times, knights, and, mounted, men, at, arms, had, frequently, dismounted, to, handle, enemies, they, could, not, overcome, on, horseback, such, as, in, the, battle, of, the, dyle, 891, and, the, battle, of, bremule, 1119, but, after, the, 1350s, this, trend, became, more, marked, with, the, dismounted, men, at, arms, fighting, as, super, heavy, infantry, with, two, handed, swords, and, poleaxes, in, any, case, warfare, in, the, middle, ages, tended, to, be, dominated, by, raids, and, sieges, rather, than, pitched, battles, and, mounted, men, at, arms, rarely, had, any, choice, other, than, dismounting, when, faced, with, the, prospect, of, assaulting, a, fortified, position, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, made, use, of, cavalry, in, many, of, his, military, campaigns, including, the, expedition, of, dhu, qarad, and, the, expedition, of, zaid, ibn, haritha, in, al, is, which, took, place, in, september, 627, ad, fifth, month, of, 6, ah, of, the, islamic, calendar, early, organized, arab, mounted, forces, under, the, rashidun, caliphate, comprised, a, light, cavalry, armed, with, lance, and, sword, its, main, role, was, to, attack, the, enemy, flanks, and, rear, these, relatively, lightly, armored, horsemen, formed, the, most, effective, element, of, the, muslim, armies, during, the, later, stages, of, the, islamic, conquest, of, the, levant, the, best, use, of, this, lightly, armed, fast, moving, cavalry, was, revealed, at, the, battle, of, yarmouk, 636, ad, in, which, khalid, ibn, walid, knowing, the, skills, of, his, horsemen, used, them, to, turn, the, tables, at, every, critical, instance, of, the, battle, with, their, ability, to, engage, disengage, then, turn, back, and, attack, again, from, the, flank, or, rear, a, strong, cavalry, regiment, was, formed, by, khalid, ibn, walid, which, included, the, veterans, of, the, campaign, of, iraq, and, syria, early, muslim, historians, have, given, it, the, name, tali, a, mutaharrikah, or, the, mobile, guard, this, was, used, as, an, advance, guard, and, a, strong, striking, force, to, route, the, opposing, armies, with, its, greater, mobility, that, give, it, an, upper, hand, when, maneuvering, against, any, byzantine, army, with, this, mobile, striking, force, the, conquest, of, syria, was, made, easy, the, battle, of, talas, in, 751, ad, was, a, conflict, between, the, arab, abbasid, caliphate, and, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, over, the, control, of, central, asia, chinese, infantry, were, routed, by, arab, cavalry, near, the, bank, of, the, river, talas, until, the, 11th, century, the, classic, cavalry, strategy, of, the, arab, middle, east, incorporated, the, razzia, tactics, of, fast, moving, raids, by, mixed, bodies, of, horsemen, and, infantry, under, the, talented, leadership, of, saladin, and, other, islamic, commanders, the, emphasis, changed, to, mamluk, horse, archers, backed, by, bodies, of, irregular, light, cavalry, trained, to, rapidly, disperse, harass, and, regroup, these, flexible, mounted, forces, proved, capable, of, withstanding, the, previously, invincible, heavy, knights, of, the, western, crusaders, at, battles, such, as, hattin, in, 1187, originating, in, the, 9th, century, as, central, asian, ghulams, or, captives, utilised, as, mounted, auxiliaries, by, arab, armies, mamluks, were, subsequently, trained, as, cavalry, soldiers, rather, than, solely, mounted, archers, with, increased, priority, being, given, to, the, use, of, lances, and, swords, mamluks, were, to, follow, the, dictates, of, al, furusiyya, a, code, of, conduct, that, included, values, like, courage, and, generosity, but, also, doctrine, of, cavalry, tactics, horsemanship, archery, and, treatment, of, wounds, by, the, late, 13th, century, the, manluk, armies, had, evolved, into, a, professional, elite, of, cavalry, backed, by, more, numerous, but, less, well, trained, footmen, the, islamic, berber, states, of, north, africa, employed, elite, horse, mounted, cavalry, armed, with, spears, and, following, the, model, of, the, original, arab, occupiers, of, the, region, horse, harness, and, weapons, were, manufactured, locally, and, the, six, monthly, stipends, for, horsemen, were, double, those, of, their, infantry, counterparts, during, the, 8th, century, islamic, conquest, of, iberia, large, numbers, of, horses, and, riders, were, shipped, from, north, africa, to, specialise, in, raiding, and, the, provision, of, support, for, the, massed, berber, footmen, of, the, main, armies, maghrebi, traditions, of, mounted, warfare, eventually, influenced, a, number, of, sub, saharan, african, polities, in, the, medieval, era, the, esos, of, ikoyi, military, aristocrats, of, the, yoruba, peoples, were, a, notable, manifestation, of, this, phenomenon, qizilbash, were, a, class, of, safavid, militant, warriors, in, iran, during, the, 15th, to, 18th, centuries, who, often, fought, as, elite, cavalry, during, its, period, of, greatest, expansion, from, the, 14th, to, 17th, centuries, cavalry, formed, the, powerful, core, of, the, ottoman, armies, registers, dated, 1475, record, 22, 000, sipahi, feudal, cavalry, levied, in, europe, 17, 000, sipahis, recruited, from, anatolia, and, 3, 000, kapikulu, regular, body, guard, cavalry, during, the, 18th, century, however, the, ottoman, mounted, troops, evolved, into, light, cavalry, serving, in, the, thinly, populated, regions, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, such, frontier, horsemen, were, largely, raised, by, local, governors, and, were, separate, from, the, main, field, armies, of, the, ottoman, empire, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, modernised, nizam, i, credit, new, army, regiments, appeared, including, full, time, cavalry, units, officered, from, the, horse, guards, of, the, sultan, ironically, the, rise, of, infantry, in, the, early, 16th, century, coincided, with, the, golden, age, of, heavy, cavalry, a, french, or, spanish, army, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, could, have, up, to, half, its, numbers, made, up, of, various, kinds, of, light, and, heavy, cavalry, whereas, in, earlier, medieval, and, later, 17th, century, armies, the, proportion, of, cavalry, was, seldom, more, than, a, quarter, knighthood, largely, lost, its, military, functions, and, became, more, closely, tied, to, social, and, economic, prestige, in, an, increasingly, capitalistic, western, society, with, the, rise, of, drilled, and, trained, infantry, the, mounted, men, at, arms, now, sometimes, called, gendarmes, and, often, part, of, the, standing, army, themselves, adopted, the, same, role, as, in, the, hellenistic, age, that, of, delivering, a, decisive, blow, once, the, battle, was, already, engaged, either, by, charging, the, enemy, in, the, flank, or, attacking, their, commander, in, chief, from, the, 1550s, onwards, the, use, of, gunpowder, weapons, solidified, infantry, s, dominance, of, the, battlefield, and, began, to, allow, true, mass, armies, to, develop, this, is, closely, related, to, the, increase, in, the, size, of, armies, throughout, the, early, modern, period, heavily, armored, cavalrymen, were, expensive, to, raise, and, maintain, and, it, took, years, to, train, a, skilled, horseman, or, a, horse, while, arquebusiers, and, later, musketeers, could, be, trained, and, kept, in, the, field, at, much, lower, cost, and, were, much, easier, to, recruit, the, spanish, tercio, and, later, formations, relegated, cavalry, to, a, supporting, role, the, pistol, was, specifically, developed, to, try, to, bring, cavalry, back, into, the, conflict, together, with, manoeuvres, such, as, the, caracole, the, caracole, was, not, particularly, successful, however, and, the, charge, whether, with, lance, sword, or, pistol, remained, as, the, primary, mode, of, employment, for, many, types, of, european, cavalry, although, by, this, time, it, was, delivered, in, much, deeper, formations, and, with, greater, discipline, than, before, the, demi, lancers, and, the, heavily, armored, sword, and, pistol, reiters, were, among, the, types, of, cavalry, whose, heyday, was, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, during, this, period, the, polish, winged, hussars, were, a, dominating, heavy, cavalry, force, in, eastern, europe, that, initially, achieved, great, success, against, swedes, russians, turks, and, other, until, repeatably, beaten, by, either, combined, arms, tactics, increase, in, firepower, or, beaten, in, melee, with, the, drabant, cavalry, of, the, swedish, empire, from, their, last, engagement, in, 1702, at, the, battle, of, klisz, w, until, 1776, the, obsolete, winged, hussars, were, demoted, and, largely, assigned, to, ceremonial, roles, the, polish, winged, hussars, military, prowess, peaked, at, the, siege, of, vienna, in, 1683, when, hussar, banners, participated, in, the, largest, cavalry, charge, in, history, and, successfully, repelled, the, ottoman, attack, cavalry, retained, an, important, role, in, this, age, of, regularization, and, standardization, across, european, armies, they, remained, the, primary, choice, for, confronting, enemy, cavalry, attacking, an, unbroken, infantry, force, head, on, usually, resulted, in, failure, but, extended, linear, infantry, formations, were, vulnerable, to, flank, or, rear, attacks, cavalry, was, important, at, blenheim, 1704, rossbach, 1757, marengo, 1800, eylau, and, friedland, 1807, remaining, significant, throughout, the, napoleonic, wars, even, with, the, increasing, prominence, of, infantry, cavalry, still, had, an, irreplaceable, role, in, armies, due, to, their, greater, mobility, their, non, battle, duties, often, included, patrolling, the, fringes, of, army, encampments, with, standing, orders, to, intercept, suspected, shirkers, and, deserters, as, well, as, serving, as, outpost, pickets, in, advance, of, the, main, body, during, battle, lighter, cavalry, such, as, hussars, and, uhlans, might, skirmish, with, other, cavalry, attack, light, infantry, or, charge, and, either, capture, enemy, artillery, or, render, them, useless, by, plugging, the, touchholes, with, iron, spikes, heavier, cavalry, such, as, cuirassiers, dragoons, and, carabiniers, usually, charged, towards, infantry, formations, or, opposing, cavalry, in, order, to, rout, them, both, light, and, heavy, cavalry, pursued, retreating, enemies, the, point, where, most, battle, casualties, occurred, the, greatest, cavalry, charge, of, modern, history, was, at, the, 1807, battle, of, eylau, when, the, entire, 11, 000, strong, french, cavalry, reserve, led, by, joachim, murat, launched, a, huge, charge, on, and, through, the, russian, infantry, lines, cavalry, s, dominating, and, menacing, presence, on, the, battlefield, was, countered, by, the, use, of, infantry, squares, the, most, notable, examples, are, at, the, battle, of, quatre, bras, and, later, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, the, latter, which, the, repeated, charges, by, up, to, 9, 000, french, cavalrymen, ordered, by, michel, ney, failed, to, break, the, british, allied, army, who, had, formed, into, squares, massed, infantry, especially, those, formed, in, squares, were, deadly, to, cavalry, but, offered, an, excellent, target, for, artillery, once, a, bombardment, had, disordered, the, infantry, formation, cavalry, were, able, to, rout, and, pursue, the, scattered, foot, soldiers, it, was, not, until, individual, firearms, gained, accuracy, and, improved, rates, of, fire, that, cavalry, was, diminished, in, this, role, as, well, even, then, light, cavalry, remained, an, indispensable, tool, for, scouting, screening, the, army, s, movements, and, harassing, the, enemy, s, supply, lines, until, military, aircraft, supplanted, them, in, this, role, in, the, early, stages, of, world, war, i, by, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, european, cavalry, fell, into, four, main, categories, there, were, cavalry, variations, for, individual, nations, as, well, france, had, the, chasseurs, cheval, prussia, had, the, j, ger, zu, pferde, bavaria, saxony, and, austria, had, the, chevaulegers, and, russia, had, cossacks, britain, from, the, mid, 18th, century, had, light, dragoons, as, light, cavalry, and, dragoons, dragoon, guards, and, household, cavalry, as, heavy, cavalry, only, after, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, were, the, household, cavalry, equipped, with, cuirasses, and, some, other, regiments, were, converted, to, lancers, in, the, united, states, army, prior, to, 1862, the, cavalry, were, almost, always, dragoons, the, imperial, japanese, army, had, its, cavalry, uniformed, as, hussars, but, they, fought, as, dragoons, in, the, crimean, war, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, and, the, thin, red, line, at, the, battle, of, balaclava, showed, the, vulnerability, of, cavalry, when, deployed, without, effective, support, during, the, franco, prussian, war, at, the, battle, of, mars, la, tour, in, 1870, a, prussian, cavalry, brigade, decisively, smashed, the, centre, of, the, french, battle, line, after, skilfully, concealing, their, approach, this, event, became, known, as, von, bredow, s, death, ride, after, the, brigade, commander, adalbert, von, bredow, it, would, be, used, in, the, following, decades, to, argue, that, massed, cavalry, charges, still, had, a, place, on, the, modern, battlefield, cavalry, found, a, new, role, in, colonial, campaigns, irregular, warfare, where, modern, weapons, were, lacking, and, the, slow, moving, infantry, artillery, train, or, fixed, fortifications, were, often, ineffective, against, indigenous, insurgents, unless, the, latter, offered, a, fight, on, an, equal, footing, as, at, tel, el, kebir, omdurman, etc, cavalry, flying, columns, proved, effective, or, at, least, cost, effective, in, many, campaigns, although, an, astute, native, commander, like, samori, in, western, africa, shamil, in, the, caucasus, or, any, of, the, better, boer, commanders, could, turn, the, tables, and, use, the, greater, mobility, of, their, cavalry, to, offset, their, relative, lack, of, firepower, compared, with, european, forces, in, 1903, the, british, indian, army, maintained, forty, regiments, of, cavalry, numbering, about, 25, 000, indian, sowars, cavalrymen, with, british, and, indian, officers, among, the, more, famous, regiments, in, the, lineages, of, the, modern, indian, and, pakistani, armies, are, several, of, these, formations, are, still, active, though, they, now, are, armoured, formations, for, example, the, guides, cavalry, of, pakistan, the, french, army, maintained, substantial, cavalry, forces, in, algeria, and, morocco, from, 1830, until, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, much, of, the, mediterranean, coastal, terrain, was, suitable, for, mounted, action, and, there, was, a, long, established, culture, of, horsemanship, amongst, the, arab, and, berber, inhabitants, the, french, forces, included, spahis, chasseurs, d, afrique, foreign, legion, cavalry, and, mounted, goumiers, both, spain, and, italy, raised, cavalry, regiments, from, amongst, the, indigenous, horsemen, of, their, north, african, territories, see, regulares, italian, spahis, and, savari, respectively, imperial, germany, employed, mounted, formations, in, south, west, africa, as, part, of, the, schutztruppen, colonial, army, garrisoning, the, territory, in, the, early, american, civil, war, the, regular, united, states, army, mounted, rifle, dragoon, and, two, existing, cavalry, regiments, were, reorganized, and, renamed, cavalry, regiments, of, which, there, were, six, over, a, hundred, other, federal, and, state, cavalry, regiments, were, organized, but, the, infantry, played, a, much, larger, role, in, many, battles, due, to, its, larger, numbers, lower, cost, per, rifle, fielded, and, much, easier, recruitment, however, cavalry, saw, a, role, as, part, of, screening, forces, and, in, foraging, and, scouting, the, later, phases, of, the, war, saw, the, federal, army, developing, a, truly, effective, cavalry, force, fighting, as, scouts, raiders, and, with, repeating, rifles, as, mounted, infantry, the, distinguished, 1st, virginia, cavalry, ranks, as, one, of, the, most, effectual, and, successful, cavalry, units, on, the, confederate, side, noted, cavalry, commanders, included, confederate, general, j, e, b, stuart, nathan, bedford, forrest, and, john, singleton, mosby, a, k, a, the, grey, ghost, and, on, the, union, side, philip, sheridan, and, george, armstrong, custer, post, civil, war, as, the, volunteer, armies, disbanded, the, regular, army, cavalry, regiments, increased, in, number, from, six, to, ten, among, them, custer, s, u, s, 7th, cavalry, regiment, of, little, bighorn, fame, and, the, african, american, u, s, 9th, cavalry, regiment, and, u, s, 10th, cavalry, regiment, the, black, units, along, with, others, both, cavalry, and, infantry, collectively, became, known, as, the, buffalo, soldiers, according, to, robert, m, utley, these, regiments, which, rarely, took, the, field, as, complete, organizations, served, throughout, the, american, indian, wars, through, the, close, of, the, frontier, in, the, 1890s, volunteer, cavalry, regiments, like, the, rough, riders, consisted, of, horsemen, such, as, cowboys, ranchers, and, other, outdoorsmen, that, served, as, a, cavalry, in, the, united, states, military, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, all, armies, still, maintained, substantial, cavalry, forces, although, there, was, contention, over, whether, their, role, should, revert, to, that, of, mounted, infantry, the, historic, dragoon, function, with, motorised, vehicles, and, aircraft, still, under, development, horse, mounted, troops, remained, the, only, fully, mobile, forces, available, for, manoeuvre, warfare, until, 1914, following, the, experience, of, the, south, african, war, of, 1899, 1902, where, mounted, boer, citizen, commandos, fighting, on, foot, from, cover, proved, more, effective, than, regular, cavalry, the, british, army, withdrew, lances, for, all, but, ceremonial, purposes, and, placed, a, new, emphasis, on, training, for, dismounted, action, in, 1903, lances, were, however, readopted, for, active, service, in, 1912, in, 1882, the, imperial, russian, army, converted, all, its, line, hussar, and, lancer, regiments, to, dragoons, with, an, emphasis, on, mounted, infantry, training, in, 1910, these, regiments, reverted, to, their, historic, roles, designations, and, uniforms, by, 1909, official, regulations, dictating, the, role, of, the, imperial, german, cavalry, had, been, revised, to, indicate, an, increasing, realization, of, the, realities, of, modern, warfare, the, massive, cavalry, charge, in, three, waves, which, had, previously, marked, the, end, of, annual, maneuvers, was, discontinued, and, a, new, emphasis, was, placed, in, training, on, scouting, raiding, and, pursuit, rather, than, main, battle, involvement, the, perceived, importance, of, cavalry, was, however, still, evident, with, thirteen, new, regiments, of, mounted, rifles, j, ger, zu, pferde, being, raised, shortly, before, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1914, in, spite, of, significant, experience, in, mounted, warfare, in, morocco, during, 1908, 14, the, french, cavalry, remained, a, highly, conservative, institution, the, traditional, tactical, distinctions, between, heavy, medium, and, light, cavalry, branches, were, retained, french, cuirassiers, wore, breastplates, and, plumed, helmets, unchanged, from, the, napoleonic, period, during, the, early, months, of, world, war, i, dragoons, were, similarly, equipped, though, they, did, not, wear, cuirasses, and, did, carry, lances, light, cavalry, were, described, as, being, a, blaze, of, colour, french, cavalry, of, all, branches, were, well, mounted, and, were, trained, to, change, position, and, charge, at, full, gallop, one, weakness, in, training, was, that, french, cavalrymen, seldom, dismounted, on, the, march, and, their, horses, suffered, heavily, from, raw, backs, in, august, 1914, in, august, 1914, all, combatant, armies, still, retained, substantial, numbers, of, cavalry, and, the, mobile, nature, of, the, opening, battles, on, both, eastern, and, western, fronts, provided, a, number, of, instances, of, traditional, cavalry, actions, though, on, a, smaller, and, more, scattered, scale, than, those, of, previous, wars, the, 110, regiments, of, imperial, german, cavalry, while, as, colourful, and, traditional, as, any, in, peacetime, appearance, had, adopted, a, practice, of, falling, back, on, infantry, support, when, any, substantial, opposition, was, encountered, these, cautious, tactics, aroused, derision, amongst, their, more, conservative, french, and, russian, opponents, but, proved, appropriate, to, the, new, nature, of, warfare, a, single, attempt, by, the, german, army, on, 12, august, 1914, to, use, six, regiments, of, massed, cavalry, to, cut, off, the, belgian, field, army, from, antwerp, floundered, when, they, were, driven, back, in, disorder, by, rifle, fire, the, two, german, cavalry, brigades, involved, lost, 492, men, and, 843, horses, in, repeated, charges, against, dismounted, belgian, lancers, and, infantry, one, of, the, last, recorded, charges, by, french, cavalry, took, place, on, the, night, of, 9, 10, september, 1914, when, a, squadron, of, the, 16th, dragoons, overran, a, german, airfield, at, soissons, while, suffering, heavy, losses, once, the, front, lines, stabilised, on, the, western, front, with, the, start, of, trench, warfare, a, combination, of, barbed, wire, uneven, muddy, terrain, machine, guns, and, rapid, fire, rifles, proved, deadly, to, horse, mounted, troops, and, by, early, 1915, most, cavalry, units, were, no, longer, seeing, front, line, action, on, the, eastern, front, a, more, fluid, form, of, warfare, arose, from, flat, open, terrain, favorable, to, mounted, warfare, on, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1914, the, bulk, of, the, russian, cavalry, was, deployed, at, full, strength, in, frontier, garrisons, and, during, the, period, that, the, main, armies, were, mobilizing, scouting, and, raiding, into, east, prussia, and, austrian, galicia, was, undertaken, by, mounted, troops, trained, to, fight, with, sabre, and, lance, in, the, traditional, style, on, 21, august, 1914, the, 4th, austro, hungarian, kavalleriedivison, fought, a, major, mounted, engagement, at, jaroslavic, with, the, russian, 10th, cavalry, division, in, what, was, arguably, the, final, historic, battle, to, involve, thousands, of, horsemen, on, both, sides, while, this, was, the, last, massed, cavalry, encounter, on, the, eastern, front, the, absence, of, good, roads, limited, the, use, of, mechanized, transport, and, even, the, technologically, advanced, imperial, german, army, continued, to, deploy, up, to, twenty, four, horse, mounted, divisions, in, the, east, as, late, as, 1917, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, on, the, western, front, cavalry, had, virtually, no, role, to, play, the, british, and, french, armies, dismounted, many, of, their, cavalry, regiments, and, used, them, in, infantry, and, other, roles, the, life, guards, for, example, spent, the, last, months, of, the, war, as, a, machine, gun, corps, and, the, australian, light, horse, served, as, light, infantry, during, the, gallipoli, campaign, in, september, 1914, cavalry, comprised, 9, 28, of, the, total, manpower, of, the, british, expeditionary, force, in, france, by, july, 1918, this, proportion, had, fallen, to, 1, 65, as, early, as, the, first, winter, of, the, war, most, french, cavalry, regiments, had, dismounted, a, squadron, each, for, service, in, the, trenches, the, french, cavalry, numbered, 102, 000, in, may, 1915, but, had, been, reduced, to, 63, 000, by, october, 1918, the, german, army, dismounted, nearly, all, their, cavalry, in, the, west, maintaining, only, one, mounted, division, on, that, front, by, january, 1917, italy, entered, the, war, in, 1915, with, thirty, regiments, of, line, cavalry, lancers, and, light, horse, while, employed, effectively, against, their, austro, hungarian, counterparts, during, the, initial, offensives, across, the, isonzo, river, the, italian, mounted, forces, ceased, to, have, a, significant, role, as, the, front, shifted, into, mountainous, terrain, by, 1916, most, cavalry, machine, gun, sections, and, two, complete, cavalry, divisions, had, been, dismounted, and, seconded, to, the, infantry, some, cavalry, were, retained, as, mounted, troops, in, reserve, behind, the, lines, in, anticipation, of, a, penetration, of, the, opposing, trenches, that, it, seemed, would, never, come, tanks, introduced, on, the, western, front, by, the, british, in, september, 1916, during, the, battle, of, the, somme, had, the, capacity, to, achieve, such, breakthroughs, but, did, not, have, the, reliable, range, to, exploit, them, in, their, first, major, use, at, the, battle, of, cambrai, 1917, the, plan, was, for, a, cavalry, division, to, follow, behind, the, tanks, however, they, were, not, able, to, cross, a, canal, because, a, tank, had, broken, the, only, bridge, on, a, few, other, occasions, throughout, the, war, cavalry, were, readied, in, significant, numbers, for, involvement, in, major, offensives, such, as, in, the, battle, of, caporetto, and, the, battle, of, moreuil, wood, however, it, was, not, until, the, german, army, had, been, forced, to, retreat, in, the, hundred, days, offensive, of, 1918, that, limited, numbers, of, cavalry, were, again, able, to, operate, with, any, effectiveness, in, their, intended, role, there, was, a, successful, charge, by, the, british, 7th, dragoon, guards, on, the, last, day, of, the, war, in, the, wider, spaces, of, the, eastern, front, a, more, fluid, form, of, warfare, continued, and, there, was, still, a, use, for, mounted, troops, some, wide, ranging, actions, were, fought, again, mostly, in, the, early, months, of, the, war, however, even, here, the, value, of, cavalry, was, overrated, and, the, maintenance, of, large, mounted, formations, at, the, front, by, the, russian, army, put, a, major, strain, on, the, railway, system, to, little, strategic, advantage, in, february, 1917, the, russian, regular, cavalry, exclusive, of, cossacks, was, reduced, by, nearly, a, third, from, its, peak, number, of, 200, 000, as, two, squadrons, of, each, regiment, were, dismounted, and, incorporated, into, additional, infantry, battalions, their, austro, hungarian, opponents, plagued, by, a, shortage, of, trained, infantry, had, been, obliged, to, progressively, convert, most, horse, cavalry, regiments, to, dismounted, rifle, units, starting, in, late, 1914, in, the, middle, east, during, the, sinai, and, palestine, campaign, mounted, forces, british, indian, ottoman, australian, arab, and, new, zealand, retained, an, important, strategic, role, both, as, mounted, infantry, and, cavalry, in, egypt, the, mounted, infantry, formations, like, the, new, zealand, mounted, rifles, brigade, and, australian, light, horse, of, anzac, mounted, division, operating, as, mounted, infantry, drove, german, and, ottoman, forces, back, from, romani, to, magdhaba, and, rafa, and, out, of, the, egyptian, sinai, peninsula, in, 1916, after, a, stalemate, on, the, gaza, beersheba, line, between, march, and, october, 1917, beersheba, was, captured, by, the, australian, mounted, division, s, 4th, light, horse, brigade, their, mounted, charge, succeeded, after, a, coordinated, attack, by, the, british, infantry, and, yeomanry, cavalry, and, the, australian, and, new, zealand, light, horse, and, mounted, rifles, brigades, a, series, of, coordinated, attacks, by, these, egyptian, expeditionary, force, infantry, and, mounted, troops, were, also, successful, at, the, battle, of, mughar, ridge, during, which, the, british, infantry, divisions, and, the, desert, mounted, corps, drove, two, ottoman, armies, back, to, the, jaffa, jerusalem, line, the, infantry, with, mainly, dismounted, cavalry, and, mounted, infantry, fought, in, the, judean, hills, to, eventually, almost, encircle, jerusalem, which, was, occupied, shortly, after, during, a, pause, in, operations, necessitated, by, the, german, spring, offensive, in, 1918, on, the, western, front, joint, infantry, and, mounted, infantry, attacks, towards, amman, and, es, salt, resulted, in, retreats, back, to, the, jordan, valley, which, continued, to, be, occupied, by, mounted, divisions, during, the, summer, of, 1918, the, australian, mounted, division, was, armed, with, swords, and, in, september, after, the, successful, breaching, of, the, ottoman, line, on, the, mediterranean, coast, by, the, british, empire, infantry, xxi, corps, was, followed, by, cavalry, attacks, by, the, 4th, cavalry, division, 5th, cavalry, division, and, australian, mounted, divisions, which, almost, encircled, two, ottoman, armies, in, the, judean, hills, forcing, their, retreat, meanwhile, chaytor, s, force, of, infantry, and, mounted, infantry, in, anzac, mounted, division, held, the, jordan, valley, covering, the, right, flank, to, later, advance, eastwards, to, capture, es, salt, and, amman, and, half, of, a, third, ottoman, army, a, subsequent, pursuit, by, the, 4th, cavalry, division, and, the, australian, mounted, division, followed, by, the, 5th, cavalry, division, to, damascus, armoured, cars, and, 5th, cavalry, division, lancers, were, continuing, the, pursuit, of, ottoman, units, north, of, aleppo, when, the, armistice, of, mudros, was, signed, by, the, ottoman, empire, a, combination, of, military, conservatism, in, almost, all, armies, and, post, war, financial, constraints, prevented, the, lessons, of, 1914, 1918, being, acted, on, immediately, there, was, a, general, reduction, in, the, number, of, cavalry, regiments, in, the, british, french, italian, and, other, western, armies, but, it, was, still, argued, with, conviction, for, example, in, the, 1922, edition, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, that, mounted, troops, had, a, major, role, to, play, in, future, warfare, the, 1920s, saw, an, interim, period, during, which, cavalry, remained, as, a, proud, and, conspicuous, element, of, all, major, armies, though, much, less, so, than, prior, to, 1914, cavalry, was, extensively, used, in, the, russian, civil, war, and, the, soviet, polish, war, the, last, major, cavalry, battle, was, the, battle, of, komar, w, in, 1920, between, poland, and, the, russian, bolsheviks, colonial, warfare, in, morocco, syria, the, middle, east, and, the, north, west, frontier, of, india, provided, some, opportunities, for, mounted, action, against, enemies, lacking, advanced, weaponry, the, post, war, german, army, reichsheer, was, permitted, a, large, proportion, of, cavalry, 18, regiments, or, 16, 4, of, total, manpower, under, the, conditions, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, the, british, army, mechanised, all, cavalry, regiments, between, 1929, and, 1941, redefining, their, role, from, horse, to, armoured, vehicles, to, form, the, royal, armoured, corps, together, with, the, royal, tank, regiment, the, u, s, cavalry, abandoned, its, sabres, in, 1934, and, commenced, the, conversion, of, its, horsed, regiments, to, mechanized, cavalry, starting, with, the, first, regiment, of, cavalry, in, january, 1933, during, the, turkish, war, of, independence, turkish, cavalry, under, general, fahrettin, altay, was, instrumental, in, the, kemalist, victory, over, the, invading, greek, army, in, 1922, during, the, battle, of, dumlup, nar, the, 5th, cavalry, division, was, able, to, slip, behind, the, main, greek, army, cutting, off, all, communication, and, supply, lines, as, well, as, retreat, options, this, forced, the, surrender, of, the, remaining, greek, forces, and, may, have, been, the, last, time, in, history, that, cavalry, played, a, definitive, role, in, the, outcome, of, a, battle, during, the, 1930s, the, french, army, experimented, with, integrating, mounted, and, mechanised, cavalry, units, into, larger, formations, dragoon, regiments, were, converted, to, motorised, infantry, trucks, and, motor, cycles, and, cuirassiers, to, armoured, units, while, light, cavalry, chasseurs, a, cheval, hussars, and, spahis, remained, as, mounted, sabre, squadrons, the, theory, was, that, mixed, forces, comprising, these, diverse, units, could, utilise, the, strengths, of, each, according, to, circumstances, in, practice, mounted, troops, proved, unable, to, keep, up, with, fast, moving, mechanised, units, over, any, distance, the, 39, cavalry, regiments, of, the, british, indian, army, were, reduced, to, 21, as, the, result, of, a, series, of, amalgamations, immediately, following, world, war, i, the, new, establishment, remained, unchanged, until, 1936, when, three, regiments, were, redesignated, as, permanent, training, units, each, with, six, still, mounted, regiments, linked, to, them, in, 1938, the, process, of, mechanization, began, with, the, conversion, of, a, full, cavalry, brigade, two, indian, regiments, and, one, british, to, armoured, car, and, tank, units, by, the, end, of, 1940, all, of, the, indian, cavalry, had, been, mechanized, initially, and, in, the, majority, of, cases, to, motorized, infantry, transported, in, 15cwt, trucks, the, last, horsed, regiment, of, the, british, indian, army, other, than, the, viceroy, s, bodyguard, and, some, indian, states, forces, regiments, was, the, 19th, king, george, s, own, lancers, which, had, its, final, mounted, parade, at, rawalpindi, on, 28, october, 1939, this, unit, still, exists, in, the, pakistan, army, as, an, armored, regiment, while, most, armies, still, maintained, cavalry, units, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, in, 1939, significant, mounted, action, was, largely, restricted, to, the, polish, balkan, and, soviet, campaigns, rather, than, charge, their, mounts, into, battle, cavalry, units, were, either, used, as, mounted, infantry, using, horses, to, move, into, position, and, then, dismounting, for, combat, or, as, reconnaissance, units, especially, in, areas, not, suited, to, tracked, or, wheeled, vehicles, a, popular, myth, is, that, polish, cavalry, armed, with, lances, charged, german, tanks, during, the, september, 1939, campaign, this, arose, from, misreporting, of, a, single, clash, on, 1, september, near, krojanty, when, two, squadrons, of, the, polish, 18th, lancers, armed, with, sabres, scattered, german, infantry, before, being, caught, in, the, open, by, german, armoured, cars, two, examples, illustrate, how, the, myth, developed, first, because, motorised, vehicles, were, in, short, supply, the, poles, used, horses, to, pull, anti, tank, weapons, into, position, second, there, were, a, few, incidents, when, polish, cavalry, was, trapped, by, german, tanks, and, attempted, to, fight, free, however, this, did, not, mean, that, the, polish, army, chose, to, attack, tanks, with, horse, cavalry, later, on, the, eastern, front, the, red, army, did, deploy, cavalry, units, effectively, against, the, germans, a, more, correct, term, would, be, mounted, infantry, instead, of, cavalry, as, horses, were, primarily, used, as, a, means, of, transportation, for, which, they, were, very, suitable, in, view, of, the, very, poor, road, conditions, in, pre, war, poland, another, myth, describes, polish, cavalry, as, being, armed, with, both, sabres, and, lances, lances, were, used, for, peacetime, ceremonial, purposes, only, and, the, primary, weapon, of, the, polish, cavalryman, in, 1939, was, a, rifle, individual, equipment, did, include, a, sabre, probably, because, of, well, established, tradition, and, in, the, case, of, a, melee, combat, this, secondary, weapon, would, probably, be, more, effective, than, a, rifle, and, bayonet, moreover, the, polish, cavalry, brigade, order, of, battle, in, 1939, included, apart, from, the, mounted, soldiers, themselves, light, and, heavy, machine, guns, wheeled, the, anti, tank, rifle, model, 35, anti, aircraft, weapons, anti, tank, artillery, such, as, the, bofors, 37, mm, also, light, and, scout, tanks, etc, the, last, cavalry, vs, cavalry, mutual, charge, in, europe, took, place, in, poland, during, the, battle, of, krasnobr, d, when, polish, and, german, cavalry, units, clashed, with, each, other, the, last, classical, cavalry, charge, of, the, war, took, place, on, march, 1, 1945, during, the, battle, of, schoenfeld, by, the, 1st, warsaw, independent, cavalry, brigade, infantry, and, tanks, had, been, employed, to, little, effect, against, the, german, position, both, of, which, floundered, in, the, open, wetlands, only, to, be, dominated, by, infantry, and, antitank, fire, from, the, german, fortifications, on, the, forward, slope, of, hill, 157, overlooking, the, wetlands, the, germans, had, not, taken, cavalry, into, consideration, when, fortifying, their, position, which, combined, with, the, warsaw, s, swift, assault, overran, the, german, anti, tank, guns, and, consolidated, into, an, attack, into, the, village, itself, now, supported, by, infantry, and, tanks, the, italian, invasion, of, greece, in, october, 1940, saw, mounted, cavalry, used, effectively, by, the, greek, defenders, along, the, mountainous, frontier, with, albania, three, greek, cavalry, regiments, two, mounted, and, one, partially, mechanized, played, an, important, role, in, the, italian, defeat, in, this, difficult, terrain, the, contribution, of, soviet, cavalry, to, the, development, of, modern, military, operational, doctrine, and, its, importance, in, defeating, nazi, germany, has, been, eclipsed, by, the, higher, profile, of, tanks, and, airplanes, soviet, cavalry, contributed, significantly, to, the, defeat, of, the, axis, armies, they, were, able, to, provide, the, most, mobile, troops, available, in, the, early, stages, when, trucks, and, other, equipment, were, low, in, quality, as, well, as, providing, cover, for, retreating, forces, considering, their, relatively, limited, numbers, the, soviet, cavalry, played, a, significant, role, in, giving, germany, its, first, real, defeats, in, the, early, stages, of, the, war, the, continuing, potential, of, mounted, troops, was, demonstrated, during, the, battle, of, moscow, against, guderian, and, the, powerful, central, german, 9th, army, pavel, belov, was, given, by, stavka, a, mobile, group, including, the, elite, 9th, tank, brigade, ski, battalions, katyusha, rocket, launcher, battalion, among, others, the, unit, additionally, received, new, weapons, this, newly, created, group, became, the, first, to, carry, the, soviet, counter, offensive, in, late, november, when, the, general, offensive, began, on, december, 5, these, mobile, units, often, played, major, roles, in, both, defensive, and, offensive, operations, cavalry, were, amongst, the, first, soviet, units, to, complete, the, encirclement, in, the, battle, of, stalingrad, thus, sealing, the, fate, of, the, german, 6th, army, mounted, soviet, forces, also, played, a, role, in, the, encirclement, of, berlin, with, some, cossack, cavalry, units, reaching, the, reichstag, in, april, 1945, throughout, the, war, they, performed, important, tasks, such, as, the, capture, of, bridgeheads, which, is, considered, one, of, the, hardest, jobs, in, battle, often, doing, so, with, inferior, numbers, for, instance, the, 8th, guards, cavalry, regiment, of, the, 2nd, guards, cavalry, division, soviet, union, 1st, guards, cavalry, corps, often, fought, outnumbered, against, elite, german, units, by, the, final, stages, of, the, war, only, the, soviet, union, was, still, fielding, mounted, units, in, substantial, numbers, some, in, combined, mechanized, and, horse, units, the, main, advantage, of, this, tactical, approach, was, in, enabling, mounted, infantry, to, keep, pace, with, advancing, tanks, other, factors, favoring, the, retention, of, mounted, forces, included, the, high, quality, of, russian, cossacks, which, provided, about, half, of, all, mounted, soviet, cavalry, throughout, the, war, they, excelled, in, warfare, manoeuvers, since, the, lack, of, roads, limited, the, effectiveness, of, wheeled, vehicles, in, many, parts, of, the, eastern, front, another, consideration, was, that, sufficient, logistic, capacity, was, often, not, available, to, support, very, large, motorized, forces, whereas, cavalry, was, relatively, easy, to, maintain, when, detached, from, the, main, army, and, acting, on, its, own, initiative, the, main, usage, of, the, soviet, cavalry, involved, infiltration, through, front, lines, with, subsequent, deep, raids, which, disorganized, german, supply, lines, another, role, was, the, pursuit, of, retreating, enemy, forces, during, major, front, line, operations, and, breakthroughs, during, world, war, ii, the, royal, hungarian, army, s, hussars, were, typically, only, used, to, undertake, reconnaissance, tasks, against, soviet, forces, and, then, only, in, detachments, of, section, or, squadron, strength, the, last, documented, hussar, attack, was, conducted, by, lieutenant, colonel, k, lm, n, mikecz, on, august, 16, 1941, at, nikolaev, the, hussars, arriving, as, reinforcements, were, employed, to, break, through, russian, positions, ahead, of, german, troops, the, hussars, equipped, with, swords, and, submachine, guns, broke, through, the, russian, lines, in, a, single, attack, an, eyewitness, account, of, the, last,

typically, been, associated, with, high, social, status, this, was, most, clearly, seen, in, the, feudal, system, where, a, lord, was, expected, to, enter, combat, armored, and, on, horseback, and,

of, the, former, and, the, twelve, cavalry, regiments, of, the, prussian, imperial, guard, an, example, of, the, latter, in, either, case, the, officers, of, such, units, were, likely, to, be, drawn, from, the, aristocracies, of, their, respective, societies, some, sense, of, the, noise, and, power, of, a, cavalry, charge, can, be, gained, from, the, 1970, film, waterloo, which, featured, some, 2,
