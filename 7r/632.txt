role, of, the, citizens, in, the, operation, and, oversight, of, government, moreover, in, the, history, of, ancient, rome, the, term, civics, also, refers, to, the, civic, crown, to, the, corona, civica, which, was, a, garland, of, oak, leaves, awarded, to, romans, who, saved, the, lives, of, fellow, citizens, in, the, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, thucydides, quotes, a, speech, by, archidamus, ii, wherein, he, stressed, the, importance, for, sparta, of, civic, education, for, the, spartan, virtues, of, toughness, obedience, cunning, simplicity, and, preparedness, and, we, are, wise, because, we, are, educated, with, too, little, learning, to, despise, the, laws, and, with, too, severe, a, self, control, to, disobey, them, and, are, brought, up, not, to, be, too, knowing, in, useless, matters, such, as, the, knowledge, which, can, give, a, specious, criticism, of, an, enemy, s, plans, in, theory, but, fails, to, assail, them, with, equal, success, in, practice, but, are, taught, to, consider, that, the, schemes, of, our, enemies, are, not, dissimilar, to, our, own, and, that, the, freaks, of, chance, are, not, determinable, by, calculation, in, practice, we, always, base, our, preparations, against, an, enemy, on, the, assumption, that, his, plans, are, good, indeed, it, is, right, to, rest, our, hopes, not, on, a, belief, in, his, blunders, but, on, the, soundness, of, our, provisions, nor, ought, we, to, believe, that, there, is, much, difference, between, man, and, man, but, to, think, that, the, superiority, lies, with, him, who, is, reared, in, the, severest, school, french, essayist, michel, de, montaigne, commended, how, agesilaus, ii, the, son, of, archidamus, followed, his, father, s, approach, closely, one, asking, to, this, purpose, agesilaus, what, he, thought, most, proper, for, boys, to, learn, what, they, ought, to, do, when, they, come, to, be, men, said, he, plutarch, relates, a, comparison, made, by, simonides, between, spartan, education, of, citizens, and, horse, husbandry, simonides, called, sparta, the, tamer, of, men, because, by, early, strictness, of, education, they, more, than, any, nation, trained, the, citizens, to, obedience, to, the, laws, and, made, them, tractable, and, patient, of, subjection, as, horses, that, are, broken, in, while, colts, according, to, the, roman, historian, plutarch, the, semi, legendary, lycurgus, of, sparta, considered, education, of, the, citizenry, to, be, his, main, priority, as, framer, of, the, spartan, constitution, plutarch, observes, that, the, whole, course, of, education, was, one, of, continued, exercise, of, a, ready, and, perfect, obedience, in, which, there, scarcely, was, any, time, or, place, without, someone, present, to, put, them, in, mind, of, their, duty, and, punish, them, if, they, had, neglected, it, he, also, describes, how, the, spartans, limited, civic, education, so, as, to, maintain, social, control, over, the, young, reading, and, writing, they, gave, them, just, enough, to, serve, their, turn, their, chief, care, was, to, make, them, good, subjects, and, to, teach, them, to, endure, pain, and, conquer, in, battle, however, the, youth, were, also, required, to, express, themselves, forcefully, and, succinctly, as, well, to, think, and, reflect, on, matters, of, civic, virtue, including, such, questions, as, who, is, or, is, not, a, good, citizen, of, sparta, montaigne, would, later, praise, this, particular, technique, of, education, admiring, the, way, spartan, citizens, spent, their, time, learning, to, acquire, virtues, such, as, courage, and, temperance, to, the, exclusion, of, studying, any, other, subject, spartan, boys, were, also, taught, music, and, songs, in, praise, of, courage, and, in, condemnation, of, cowardice, essentially, the, spartan, ideal, of, civic, education, was, a, process, whereby, the, interest, of, the, citizen, becomes, totally, united, with, the, interest, of, the, polity, in, a, spirit, of, perfect, patriotism, to, conclude, lycurgus, bred, up, his, citizens, in, such, a, way, that, they, neither, would, nor, could, live, by, themselves, they, were, to, make, themselves, one, with, the, public, good, and, clustering, like, bees, around, their, commander, be, by, their, zeal, and, public, spirit, carried, all, but, out, of, themselves, and, devoted, wholly, to, their, country, civic, education, for, toughness, and, martial, prowess, was, not, only, within, the, purview, of, spartan, men, plutarch, recounts, how, lycurgus, ordered, the, maidens, to, exercises, themselves, with, wrestling, running, throwing, the, quoit, and, chasing, the, dart, with, a, view, to, creating, healthy, children, for, the, state, pericles, funeral, oration, provides, insight, into, athens, sharply, contrasting, form, of, civic, education, from, sparta, for, personal, freedom, rather, than, blind, obedience, where, he, boasts, that, athens, is, the, school, of, hellas, since, in, education, where, our, rivals, from, their, very, cradles, by, a, painful, discipline, seek, after, manliness, at, athens, we, live, exactly, as, we, please, and, yet, are, just, as, ready, to, encounter, every, legitimate, danger, however, english, philosopher, thomas, hobbes, believed, that, the, athenians, were, only, taught, to, think, they, had, personal, freedom, in, order, to, discourage, them, from, seeking, reform, in, the, socratic, dialogue, crito, crito, of, alopece, learns, from, socrates, the, importance, in, civic, education, of, following, expert, opinion, rather, than, majority, opinion, socrates, uses, the, analogy, of, the, training, gymnast, who, he, implies, ought, to, follow, his, gymnastics, trainer, not, whatever, the, majority, of, people, think, about, gymnastics, crito, also, hears, socrates, argument, that, a, citizen, ought, to, obey, his, city, s, laws, partly, because, it, was, his, city, which, educated, him, for, citizenship, in, the, aristophanes, comedy, the, frogs, the, character, of, the, playwright, aeschylus, scolds, fellow, tragedian, euripides, for, writing, scenes, pernicious, to, proper, ideals, of, citizenship, what, crimes, is, he, not, guilty, of, did, he, not, put, up, on, display, pimps, and, women, giving, birth, in, holy, shrines, and, having, sex, with, their, own, brothers, and, then, claim, that, living, is, no, life, so, now, because, of, him, our, city, here, is, crammed, with, bureaucratic, types, and, stupid, democratic, apes, who, always, cheat, our, people, nobody, carries, on, the, torch, no, one, s, trained, in, that, these, days, during, his, diatribe, he, emphasises, the, importance, of, poetry, to, civic, education, small, children, have, a, teacher, helping, them, for, young, men, there, s, the, poets, we, ve, got, a, solemn, duty, to, say, useful, things, similarly, plutarch, would, later, speak, of, the, power, of, the, poet, thales, to, in, the, words, of, the, english, poet, john, milton, prepare, and, mollify, the, spartan, surliness, with, his, smooth, songs, and, odes, the, better, to, plant, among, them, law, and, civility, plutarch, also, spoke, of, the, deep, influence, of, homer, s, lessons, of, state, on, lycurgus, framer, of, the, spartan, constitution, in, the, euripides, tragedy, the, suppliants, king, adrastus, of, argos, describes, how, hippomedon, received, his, civic, education, for, endurance, martial, skill, and, service, to, the, state, such, another, was, hippomedon, third, of, all, this, band, from, his, very, boyhood, he, refrained, from, turning, towards, the, allurements, of, the, muses, to, lead, life, of, ease, his, home, was, in, the, fields, and, gladly, would, he, school, his, nature, to, hardships, with, a, view, to, manliness, aye, hasting, to, the, chase, rejoicing, in, his, steeds, or, straining, of, his, bow, because, he, would, make, himself, of, use, unto, his, state, adrastus, also, describes, how, parthenopeus, received, his, education, for, citizenship, in, his, adopted, city, next, behold, the, huntress, atalanta, s, son, parthenopaeus, a, youth, of, peerless, beauty, from, arcady, he, came, even, to, the, streams, of, inachus, and, in, argos, spent, his, boyhood, there, when, he, grew, to, man, s, estate, first, as, is, the, duty, of, strangers, settled, in, another, land, he, showed, no, pique, or, jealousy, against, the, state, became, no, quibbler, chiefest, source, of, annoyance, citizen, or, stranger, can, give, but, took, his, stand, amid, the, host, and, fought, for, argos, as, he, were, her, own, son, glad, at, heart, whenso, the, city, prospered, deeply, grieved, if, e, er, reverses, came, many, a, lover, though, he, had, midst, men, and, maids, yet, was, he, careful, to, avoid, offence, in, his, meditations, marcus, aurelius, tells, of, how, he, was, educated, as, a, citizen, to, value, free, speech, to, refrain, from, rhetoric, and, giving, hortatory, lectures, and, to, perceive, the, defects, of, tyranny, from, his, brother, he, imbibed, a, specific, ideal, for, the, roman, state, he, it, was, also, that, did, put, me, in, the, first, conceit, and, desire, of, an, equal, commonwealth, administered, by, justice, and, equality, and, of, a, kingdom, wherein, should, be, regarded, nothing, more, than, the, good, and, welfare, of, the, subjects, he, also, followed, the, example, of, his, adopted, father, antoninus, pius, who, he, said, kept, careful, watch, of, government, administration, and, finances, was, open, to, hearing, ideas, about, how, to, serve, the, common, good, and, cared, neither, for, ambition, nor, pandering, to, the, popular, will, again, that, secrets, he, neither, had, many, nor, often, and, such, only, as, concerned, public, matters, his, discretion, and, moderation, in, exhibiting, of, the, public, sights, and, shows, for, the, pleasure, and, pastime, of, the, people, in, public, buildings, congiaries, and, the, like, in, all, these, things, having, a, respect, unto, men, only, as, men, and, to, the, equity, of, the, things, themselves, and, not, unto, the, glory, that, might, follow, aurelius, was, also, taught, by, his, father, how, to, live, as, a, public, figure, restrained, by, modesty, that, i, lived, under, the, government, of, my, lord, and, father, who, would, take, away, from, me, all, pride, and, vainglory, and, reduce, me, to, that, conceit, and, opinion, that, it, was, not, impossible, for, a, prince, to, live, in, the, court, without, a, troop, of, guards, and, followers, extraordinary, apparel, such, and, such, torches, and, statues, and, other, like, particulars, of, state, and, magnificence, but, that, a, man, may, reduce, and, contract, himself, almost, to, the, state, of, a, private, man, and, yet, for, all, that, not, to, become, the, more, base, and, remiss, in, those, public, matters, and, affairs, wherein, power, and, authority, is, requisite, in, his, treatise, leviathan, english, philosopher, thomas, hobbes, heavily, criticised, the, emphasis, in, contemporary, civic, education, on, studying, athenian, democracy, and, roman, republicanism, saying, that, it, wrongly, encouraged, monarchical, subjects, to, restrain, the, actions, of, their, monarchs, he, thought, that, those, citizens, who, imbibed, the, value, of, democracy, from, classic, works, were, likely, to, oppose, monarchy, in, the, manner, rabid, dogs, avoid, water, hobbes, was, deeply, uncomfortable, with, aristotelian, civic, education, which, he, said, advised, popular, governance, instead, of, monarchical, rule, english, philosopher, francis, bacon, was, aware, of, the, relevance, of, civic, education, to, what, he, termed, civil, merit, however, in, his, essay, the, advancement, of, learning, bacon, also, argues, that, civic, education, should, be, preceded, by, religious, and, moral, education, so, that, those, who, judge, policy, will, not, be, under, the, influence, of, moral, relativism, sudbury, schools, contend, that, values, social, justice, and, democracy, must, be, learned, through, experience, as, aristotle, said, for, the, things, we, have, to, learn, before, we, can, do, them, we, learn, by, doing, them, they, adduce, that, for, this, purpose, schools, must, encourage, ethical, behavior, and, personal, responsibility, in, order, to, achieve, these, goals, schools, must, allow, students, the, three, great, freedoms, freedom, of, choice, freedom, of, action, and, freedom, to, bear, the, results, of, action, that, constitute, personal, responsibility, the, strongest, political, rationale, for, democratic, schools, is, that, they, teach, the, virtues, of, democratic, deliberation, for, the, sake, of, future, citizenship, this, type, of, education, is, often, alluded, to, in, the, deliberative, democracy, literature, as, fulfilling, the, necessary, and, fundamental, social, and, institutional, changes, necessary, to, develop, a, democracy, that, involves, intensive, participation, in, group, decision, making, negotiation, and, social, life, of, consequence
