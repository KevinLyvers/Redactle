social, research, is, research, conducted, by, social, scientists, following, a, systematic, plan, social, research, methodologies, can, be, classified, as, quantitative, and, qualitative, most, methods, contain, elements, of, both, for, example, qualitative, data, analysis, often, involves, a, fairly, structured, approach, to, coding, raw, data, into, systematic, information, and, quantifying, intercoder, reliability, there, is, often, a, more, complex, relationship, between, qualitative, and, quantitative, approaches, than, would, be, suggested, by, drawing, a, simple, distinction, between, them, social, scientists, employ, a, range, of, methods, in, order, to, analyze, a, vast, breadth, of, social, phenomena, from, analyzing, census, survey, data, derived, from, millions, of, individuals, to, conducting, in, depth, analysis, of, a, single, agent, s, social, experiences, from, monitoring, what, is, happening, on, contemporary, streets, to, investigating, historical, documents, methods, rooted, in, classical, sociology, and, statistics, have, formed, the, basis, for, research, in, disciplines, such, as, political, science, and, media, studies, they, are, also, often, used, in, program, evaluation, and, market, research, social, scientists, are, divided, into, camps, of, support, for, particular, research, techniques, these, disputes, relate, to, the, historical, core, of, social, theory, positivism, and, antipositivism, structure, and, agency, while, very, different, in, many, aspects, both, qualitative, and, quantitative, approaches, involve, a, systematic, interaction, between, theory, and, data, the, choice, of, method, often, depends, largely, on, what, the, researcher, intends, to, investigate, for, example, a, researcher, concerned, with, drawing, a, statistical, generalization, across, an, entire, population, may, administer, a, survey, questionnaire, to, a, representative, sample, population, by, contrast, a, researcher, who, seeks, full, contextual, understanding, of, an, individual, s, social, actions, may, choose, ethnographic, participant, observation, or, open, ended, interviews, studies, will, commonly, combine, or, triangulate, quantitative, and, qualitative, methods, as, part, of, a, multi, strategy, design, typically, a, population, is, very, large, making, a, census, or, a, complete, enumeration, of, all, the, values, in, that, population, infeasible, a, sample, thus, forms, a, manageable, subset, of, a, population, in, positivist, research, statistics, derived, from, a, sample, are, analysed, in, order, to, draw, inferences, regarding, the, population, as, a, whole, the, process, of, collecting, information, from, a, sample, is, referred, to, as, sampling, sampling, methods, may, be, either, random, random, sampling, systematic, sampling, stratified, sampling, cluster, sampling, or, non, random, nonprobability, convenience, sampling, purposive, sampling, snowball, sampling, the, most, common, reason, for, sampling, is, to, obtain, information, about, a, population, sampling, is, quicker, and, cheaper, than, a, complete, census, of, a, population, social, research, is, based, on, logic, and, empirical, observations, charles, c, ragin, writes, in, his, constructing, social, research, book, that, social, research, involved, the, interaction, between, ideas, and, evidence, ideas, help, social, researchers, make, sense, of, evidence, and, researchers, use, evidence, to, extend, revise, and, test, ideas, social, research, thus, attempts, to, create, or, validate, theories, through, data, collection, and, data, analysis, and, its, goal, is, exploration, description, explanation, and, prediction, it, should, never, lead, or, be, mistaken, with, philosophy, or, belief, social, research, aims, to, find, social, patterns, of, regularity, in, social, life, and, usually, deals, with, social, groups, aggregates, of, individuals, not, individuals, themselves, although, science, of, psychology, is, an, exception, here, research, can, also, be, divided, into, pure, research, and, applied, research, pure, research, has, no, application, on, real, life, whereas, applied, research, attempts, to, influence, the, real, world, there, are, no, laws, in, social, science, that, parallel, the, laws, in, natural, science, a, law, in, social, science, is, a, universal, generalization, about, a, class, of, facts, a, fact, is, an, observed, phenomenon, and, observation, means, it, has, been, seen, heard, or, otherwise, experienced, by, researcher, a, theory, is, a, systematic, explanation, for, the, observations, that, relate, to, a, particular, aspect, of, social, life, concepts, are, the, basic, building, blocks, of, theory, and, are, abstract, elements, representing, classes, of, phenomena, axioms, or, postulates, are, basic, assertions, assumed, to, be, true, propositions, are, conclusions, drawn, about, the, relationships, among, concepts, based, on, analysis, of, axioms, hypotheses, are, specified, expectations, about, empirical, reality, derived, from, propositions, social, research, involves, testing, these, hypotheses, to, see, if, they, are, true, social, research, involves, creating, a, theory, operationalization, measurement, of, variables, and, observation, actual, collection, of, data, to, test, hypothesized, relationship, social, theories, are, written, in, the, language, of, variables, in, other, words, theories, describe, logical, relationships, between, variables, variables, are, logical, sets, of, attributes, with, people, being, the, carriers, of, those, variables, for, example, gender, can, be, a, variable, with, two, or, more, attributes, male, female, and, non, binary, gender, variables, are, also, divided, into, independent, variables, data, that, influences, the, dependent, variables, which, scientists, are, trying, to, explain, for, example, in, a, study, of, how, different, dosages, of, a, drug, are, related, to, the, severity, of, symptoms, of, a, disease, a, measure, of, the, severity, of, the, symptoms, of, the, disease, is, a, dependent, variable, and, the, administration, of, the, drug, in, specified, doses, is, the, independent, variable, researchers, will, compare, the, different, values, of, the, dependent, variable, severity, of, the, symptoms, and, attempt, to, draw, conclusions, when, social, scientists, speak, of, good, research, the, guidelines, refer, to, how, the, science, is, mentioned, and, understood, it, does, not, refer, to, how, what, the, results, are, but, how, they, are, figured, glenn, firebaugh, summarizes, the, principles, for, good, research, in, his, book, seven, rules, for, social, research, the, first, rule, is, that, there, should, be, the, possibility, of, surprise, in, social, research, as, firebaugh, p, 1, elaborates, rule, 1, is, intended, to, warn, that, you, don, t, want, to, be, blinded, by, preconceived, ideas, so, that, you, fail, to, look, for, contrary, evidence, or, you, fail, to, recognize, contrary, evidence, when, you, do, encounter, it, or, you, recognize, contrary, evidence, but, suppress, it, and, refuse, to, accept, your, findings, for, what, they, appear, to, say, in, addition, good, research, will, look, for, differences, that, make, a, difference, rule, 2, and, build, in, reality, checks, rule, 3, rule, 4, advises, researchers, to, replicate, that, is, to, see, if, identical, analyses, yield, similar, results, for, different, samples, of, people, p, 90, the, next, two, rules, urge, researchers, to, compare, like, with, like, rule, 5, and, to, study, change, rule, 6, these, two, rules, are, especially, important, when, researchers, want, to, estimate, the, effect, of, one, variable, on, another, e, g, how, much, does, college, education, actually, matter, for, wages, the, final, rule, let, method, be, the, servant, not, the, master, reminds, researchers, that, methods, are, the, means, not, the, end, of, social, research, it, is, critical, from, the, outset, to, fit, the, research, design, to, the, research, issue, rather, than, the, other, way, around, explanations, in, social, theories, can, be, idiographic, or, nomothetic, an, idiographic, approach, to, an, explanation, is, one, where, the, scientists, seek, to, exhaust, the, idiosyncratic, causes, of, a, particular, condition, or, event, i, e, by, trying, to, provide, all, possible, explanations, of, a, particular, case, nomothetic, explanations, tend, to, be, more, general, with, scientists, trying, to, identify, a, few, causal, factors, that, impact, a, wide, class, of, conditions, or, events, for, example, when, dealing, with, the, problem, of, how, people, choose, a, job, idiographic, explanation, would, be, to, list, all, possible, reasons, why, a, given, person, or, group, chooses, a, given, job, while, nomothetic, explanation, would, try, to, find, factors, that, determine, why, job, applicants, in, general, choose, a, given, job, research, in, science, and, in, social, science, is, a, long, slow, and, difficult, process, that, sometimes, produces, false, results, because, of, methodological, weaknesses, and, in, rare, cases, because, of, fraud, so, that, reliance, on, any, one, study, is, inadvisable, the, ethics, of, social, research, are, shared, with, those, of, medical, research, in, the, united, states, these, are, formalized, by, the, belmont, report, as, the, principle, of, respect, for, persons, holds, that, a, individuals, should, be, respected, as, autonomous, agents, capable, of, making, their, own, decisions, and, that, b, subjects, with, diminished, autonomy, deserve, special, considerations, a, cornerstone, of, this, principle, is, the, use, of, informed, consent, the, principle, of, beneficence, holds, that, a, the, subjects, of, research, should, be, protected, from, harm, and, b, the, research, should, bring, tangible, benefits, to, society, by, this, definition, research, with, no, scientific, merit, is, automatically, considered, unethical, the, principle, of, justice, states, the, benefits, of, research, should, be, distributed, fairly, the, definition, of, fairness, used, is, case, dependent, varying, between, 1, to, each, person, an, equal, share, 2, to, each, person, according, to, individual, need, 3, to, each, person, according, to, individual, effort, 4, to, each, person, according, to, societal, contribution, and, 5, to, each, person, according, to, merit, the, following, list, of, research, methods, is, not, exhaustive, the, origin, of, the, survey, can, be, traced, back, at, least, early, as, the, domesday, book, in, 1086, while, some, scholars, pinpoint, the, origin, of, demography, to, 1663, with, the, publication, of, john, graunt, s, natural, and, political, observations, upon, the, bills, of, mortality, social, research, began, most, intentionally, however, with, the, positivist, philosophy, of, science, in, the, early, 19th, century, statistical, sociological, research, and, indeed, the, formal, academic, discipline, of, sociology, began, with, the, work, of, mile, durkheim, 1858, 1917, while, durkheim, rejected, much, of, the, detail, of, auguste, comte, s, philosophy, he, retained, and, refined, its, method, maintaining, that, the, social, sciences, are, a, logical, continuation, of, the, natural, ones, into, the, realm, of, human, activity, and, insisting, that, they, may, retain, the, same, objectivity, rationalism, and, approach, to, causality, durkheim, set, up, the, first, european, department, of, sociology, at, the, university, of, bordeaux, in, 1895, publishing, his, rules, of, the, sociological, method, 1895, in, this, text, he, argued, ur, main, goal, is, to, extend, scientific, rationalism, to, human, conduct, what, has, been, called, our, positivism, is, but, a, consequence, of, this, rationalism, durkheim, s, seminal, monograph, suicide, 1897, a, case, study, of, suicide, rates, among, catholic, and, protestant, populations, distinguished, sociological, analysis, from, psychology, or, philosophy, by, carefully, examining, suicide, statistics, in, different, police, districts, he, attempted, to, demonstrate, that, catholic, communities, have, a, lower, suicide, rate, than, that, of, protestants, something, he, attributed, to, social, as, opposed, to, individual, or, psychological, causes, he, developed, the, notion, of, objective, suis, generis, social, facts, to, delineate, a, unique, empirical, object, for, the, science, of, sociology, to, study, through, such, studies, he, posited, that, sociology, would, be, able, to, determine, whether, any, given, society, is, healthy, or, pathological, and, seek, social, reform, to, negate, organic, breakdown, or, social, anomie, for, durkheim, sociology, could, be, described, as, the, science, of, institutions, their, genesis, and, their, functioning, in, the, early, 20th, century, innovation, in, survey, methodology, were, developed, that, are, still, dominant, in, 1928, the, psychologist, louis, leon, thurstone, developed, a, method, to, select, and, score, multiple, items, with, which, to, measure, complex, ideas, such, as, attitudes, towards, religion, in, 1932, the, psychologist, rensis, likert, developed, the, likert, scale, where, participants, rate, their, agreement, with, statement, using, five, options, from, totally, disagree, to, totally, agree, likert, like, scales, remain, the, most, frequently, used, items, in, survey, in, the, mid, 20th, century, there, was, a, general, but, not, universal, trend, for, american, sociology, to, be, more, scientific, in, nature, due, to, the, prominence, at, that, time, of, action, theory, and, other, system, theoretical, approaches, robert, k, merton, released, his, social, theory, and, social, structure, 1949, by, the, turn, of, the, 1960s, sociological, research, was, increasingly, employed, as, a, tool, by, governments, and, businesses, worldwide, sociologists, developed, new, types, of, quantitative, and, qualitative, research, methods, paul, lazarsfeld, founded, columbia, university, s, bureau, of, applied, social, research, where, he, exerted, a, tremendous, influence, over, the, techniques, and, the, organization, of, social, research, his, many, contributions, to, sociological, method, have, earned, him, the, title, of, the, founder, of, modern, empirical, sociology, lazarsfeld, made, great, strides, in, statistical, survey, analysis, panel, methods, latent, structure, analysis, and, contextual, analysis, many, of, his, ideas, have, been, so, influential, as, to, now, be, considered, self, evident
