nature, is, a, british, weekly, scientific, journal, founded, and, based, in, london, england, as, a, multidisciplinary, publication, nature, features, peer, reviewed, research, from, a, variety, of, academic, disciplines, mainly, in, science, and, technology, it, has, core, editorial, offices, across, the, united, states, continental, europe, and, asia, under, the, international, scientific, publishing, company, springer, nature, nature, was, one, of, the, world, s, most, cited, scientific, journals, by, the, science, edition, of, the, 2022, journal, citation, reports, with, an, ascribed, impact, factor, of, 50, 5, making, it, one, of, the, world, s, most, read, and, most, prestigious, academic, journals, as, of, 2012, it, claimed, an, online, readership, of, about, three, million, unique, readers, per, month, founded, in, autumn, 1869, nature, was, first, circulated, by, norman, lockyer, and, alexander, macmillan, as, a, public, forum, for, scientific, innovations, the, mid, 20th, century, facilitated, an, editorial, expansion, for, the, journal, nature, redoubled, its, efforts, in, explanatory, and, scientific, journalism, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, saw, the, creation, of, a, network, of, editorial, offices, outside, of, britain, and, the, establishment, of, ten, new, supplementary, speciality, publications, e, g, nature, materials, since, the, late, 2000s, dedicated, editorial, and, current, affairs, columns, are, created, weekly, and, electoral, endorsements, are, featured, the, primary, source, of, the, journal, remains, as, established, at, its, founding, research, scientists, editing, standards, are, primarily, concerned, with, technical, readability, each, issue, also, features, articles, that, are, of, general, interest, to, the, scientific, community, namely, business, funding, scientific, ethics, and, research, breakthroughs, there, are, also, sections, on, books, arts, and, short, science, fiction, stories, the, main, research, published, in, nature, consists, mostly, of, papers, articles, or, letters, in, lightly, edited, form, they, are, highly, technical, and, dense, but, due, to, imposed, text, limits, they, are, typically, summaries, of, larger, work, innovations, or, breakthroughs, in, any, scientific, or, technological, field, are, featured, in, the, journal, as, either, letters, or, news, articles, the, papers, that, have, been, published, in, this, journal, are, internationally, acclaimed, for, maintaining, high, research, standards, conversely, due, to, the, journal, s, exposure, it, has, at, various, times, been, a, subject, of, controversy, for, its, handling, of, academic, dishonesty, the, scientific, method, and, news, coverage, fewer, than, 8, of, submitted, papers, are, accepted, for, publication, in, 2007, nature, together, with, science, received, the, prince, of, asturias, award, for, communications, and, humanity, nature, mostly, publishes, research, articles, spotlight, articles, are, not, research, papers, but, mostly, news, or, magazine, style, papers, and, hence, do, not, count, towards, impact, factor, nor, receive, similar, recognition, as, research, articles, some, spotlight, articles, are, also, paid, by, partners, or, sponsors, the, huge, progress, in, science, and, mathematics, during, the, 19th, century, was, recorded, in, journals, written, mostly, in, german, or, french, as, well, as, in, english, britain, underwent, enormous, technological, and, industrial, changes, and, advances, particularly, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, most, respected, scientific, journals, of, this, time, were, the, refereed, journals, of, the, royal, society, which, had, published, many, of, the, great, works, from, isaac, newton, and, michael, faraday, to, charles, darwin, in, addition, the, number, of, popular, science, periodicals, doubled, from, the, 1850s, to, the, 1860s, according, to, the, editors, of, these, popular, science, magazines, the, publications, were, designed, to, serve, as, organs, of, science, in, essence, a, means, of, connecting, the, public, to, the, scientific, world, nature, first, created, in, 1869, was, not, the, first, magazine, of, its, kind, in, britain, one, journal, to, precede, nature, was, recreative, science, a, record, and, remembrancer, of, intellectual, observation, which, created, in, 1859, began, as, a, natural, history, magazine, and, progressed, to, include, more, physical, observational, science, and, technical, subjects, and, less, natural, history, the, journal, s, name, changed, from, its, original, title, to, intellectual, observer, a, review, of, natural, history, microscopic, research, and, recreative, science, and, then, to, the, student, and, intellectual, observer, of, science, literature, and, art, while, recreative, science, had, attempted, to, include, more, physical, sciences, such, as, astronomy, and, archaeology, the, intellectual, observer, broadened, itself, further, to, include, literature, and, art, as, well, similar, to, recreative, science, was, the, scientific, journal, popular, science, review, created, in, 1862, which, covered, different, fields, of, science, by, creating, subsections, titled, scientific, summary, or, quarterly, retrospect, with, book, reviews, and, commentary, on, the, latest, scientific, works, and, publications, two, other, journals, produced, in, england, prior, to, the, development, of, nature, were, the, quarterly, journal, of, science, and, scientific, opinion, established, in, 1864, and, 1868, respectively, the, journal, most, closely, related, to, nature, in, its, editorship, and, format, was, the, reader, created, in, 1863, the, publication, mixed, science, with, literature, and, art, in, an, attempt, to, reach, an, audience, outside, of, the, scientific, community, similar, to, popular, science, review, these, similar, journals, all, ultimately, failed, the, popular, science, review, survived, longest, lasting, 20, years, and, ending, its, publication, in, 1881, recreative, science, ceased, publication, as, the, student, and, intellectual, observer, in, 1871, the, quarterly, journal, after, undergoing, a, number, of, editorial, changes, ceased, publication, in, 1885, the, reader, terminated, in, 1867, and, finally, scientific, opinion, lasted, a, mere, 2, years, until, june, 1870, not, long, after, the, conclusion, of, the, reader, a, former, editor, norman, lockyer, decided, to, create, a, new, scientific, journal, titled, nature, taking, its, name, from, a, line, by, william, wordsworth, to, the, solid, ground, of, nature, trusts, the, mind, that, builds, for, aye, first, owned, and, published, by, alexander, macmillan, nature, was, similar, to, its, predecessors, in, its, attempt, to, provide, cultivated, readers, with, an, accessible, forum, for, reading, about, advances, in, scientific, knowledge, janet, browne, has, proposed, that, far, more, than, any, other, science, journal, of, the, period, nature, was, conceived, born, and, raised, to, serve, polemic, purpose, many, of, the, early, editions, of, nature, consisted, of, articles, written, by, members, of, a, group, that, called, itself, the, x, club, a, group, of, scientists, known, for, having, liberal, progressive, and, somewhat, controversial, scientific, beliefs, for, their, time, initiated, by, thomas, henry, huxley, the, group, consisted, of, such, important, scientists, as, joseph, dalton, hooker, herbert, spencer, and, john, tyndall, along, with, another, five, scientists, and, mathematicians, these, scientists, were, all, avid, supporters, of, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, as, common, descent, a, theory, which, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, received, a, great, deal, of, criticism, among, more, conservative, groups, of, scientists, perhaps, it, was, in, part, its, scientific, liberality, that, made, nature, a, longer, lasting, success, than, its, predecessors, john, maddox, editor, of, nature, from, 1966, to, 1973, and, from, 1980, to, 1995, suggested, at, a, celebratory, dinner, for, the, journal, s, centennial, edition, that, perhaps, it, was, the, journalistic, qualities, of, nature, that, drew, readers, in, journalism, maddox, states, is, a, way, of, creating, a, sense, of, community, among, people, who, would, otherwise, be, isolated, from, each, other, this, is, what, lockyer, s, journal, did, from, the, start, in, addition, maddox, mentions, that, the, financial, backing, of, the, journal, in, its, first, years, by, the, macmillan, family, also, allowed, the, journal, to, flourish, and, develop, more, freely, than, scientific, journals, before, it, norman, lockyer, the, founder, of, nature, was, a, professor, at, imperial, college, he, was, succeeded, as, editor, in, 1919, by, sir, richard, gregory, gregory, helped, to, establish, nature, in, the, international, scientific, community, his, obituary, by, the, royal, society, stated, gregory, was, always, very, interested, in, the, international, contacts, of, science, and, in, the, columns, of, nature, he, always, gave, generous, space, to, accounts, of, the, activities, of, the, international, scientific, unions, during, the, years, 1945, to, 1973, editorship, of, nature, changed, three, times, first, in, 1945, to, a, j, v, gale, and, l, j, f, brimble, who, in, 1958, became, the, sole, editor, then, to, john, maddox, in, 1965, and, finally, to, david, davies, in, 1973, in, 1980, maddox, returned, as, editor, and, retained, his, position, until, 1995, philip, campbell, became, editor, in, chief, of, all, nature, publications, until, 2018, magdalena, skipper, has, since, become, editor, in, chief, in, 1970, nature, first, opened, its, washington, office, other, branches, opened, in, new, york, in, 1985, tokyo, and, munich, in, 1987, paris, in, 1989, san, francisco, in, 2001, boston, in, 2004, and, hong, kong, in, 2005, in, 1971, under, john, maddox, s, editorship, the, journal, split, into, nature, physical, sciences, published, on, mondays, nature, new, biology, published, on, wednesdays, and, nature, published, on, fridays, in, 1974, maddox, was, no, longer, editor, and, the, journals, were, merged, into, nature, starting, in, the, 1980s, the, journal, underwent, a, great, deal, of, expansion, launching, over, ten, new, journals, these, new, journals, comprise, nature, research, which, was, created, in, 1999, under, the, name, nature, publishing, group, and, includes, nature, nature, research, journals, stockton, press, specialist, journals, and, macmillan, reference, renamed, npg, reference, in, 1996, nature, created, its, own, website, and, in, 1999, nature, publishing, group, began, its, series, of, nature, reviews, some, articles, and, papers, are, available, for, free, on, the, nature, website, while, others, require, the, purchase, of, premium, access, to, the, site, as, of, 2012, nature, claimed, an, online, readership, of, about, 3, million, unique, readers, per, month, on, 30, october, 2008, nature, endorsed, an, american, presidential, candidate, for, the, first, time, when, it, supported, barack, obama, during, his, campaign, in, america, s, 2008, presidential, election, in, october, 2012, an, arabic, edition, of, the, magazine, was, launched, in, partnership, with, king, abdulaziz, city, for, science, and, technology, as, of, the, time, it, was, released, it, had, about, 10, 000, subscribers, on, 2, december, 2014, nature, announced, that, it, would, allow, its, subscribers, and, a, group, of, selected, media, outlets, to, share, links, allowing, free, read, only, access, to, content, from, its, journals, these, articles, are, presented, using, the, digital, rights, management, system, readcube, which, is, funded, by, the, macmillan, subsidiary, digital, science, and, does, not, allow, readers, to, download, copy, print, or, otherwise, distribute, the, content, while, it, does, to, an, extent, provide, free, online, access, to, articles, it, is, not, a, true, open, access, scheme, due, to, its, restrictions, on, re, use, and, distribution, on, 15, january, 2015, details, of, a, proposed, merger, with, springer, science, business, media, were, announced, in, may, 2015, it, came, under, the, umbrella, of, springer, nature, by, the, merger, of, springer, science, business, media, and, holtzbrinck, publishing, group, s, nature, publishing, group, palgrave, macmillan, and, macmillan, education, since, 2011, the, journal, has, published, nature, s, 10, people, who, mattered, during, the, year, as, part, of, their, annual, review, according, to, science, another, academic, journal, being, published, in, nature, has, been, known, to, carry, a, certain, level, of, prestige, in, academia, in, particular, empirical, papers, are, often, highly, cited, which, can, lead, to, promotions, grant, funding, and, attention, from, the, mainstream, media, because, of, these, positive, feedback, effects, competition, among, scientists, to, publish, in, high, level, journals, like, nature, and, its, closest, competitor, science, can, be, very, fierce, nature, s, impact, factor, a, measure, of, how, many, citations, a, journal, generates, in, other, works, was, 42, 778, in, 2019, as, measured, by, thomson, isi, however, as, with, many, journals, most, papers, receive, far, fewer, citations, than, the, impact, factor, would, indicate, nature, s, journal, impact, factor, carries, a, long, tail, studies, of, methodological, quality, and, reliability, have, found, that, some, high, prestige, journals, including, nature, publish, significantly, substandard, structures, and, overall, reliability, of, published, research, works, in, several, fields, may, be, decreasing, with, increasing, journal, rank, as, with, most, other, professional, scientific, journals, papers, undergo, an, initial, screening, by, the, editor, followed, by, peer, review, in, which, other, scientists, chosen, by, the, editor, for, expertise, with, the, subject, matter, but, who, have, no, connection, to, the, research, under, review, will, read, and, critique, articles, before, publication, in, the, case, of, nature, they, are, only, sent, for, review, if, it, is, decided, that, they, deal, with, a, topical, subject, and, are, sufficiently, ground, breaking, in, that, particular, field, as, a, consequence, the, majority, of, submitted, papers, are, rejected, without, review, according, to, nature, s, original, mission, statement, it, is, intended, first, to, place, before, the, general, public, the, grand, results, of, scientific, work, and, scientific, discovery, and, to, urge, the, claims, of, science, to, a, more, general, recognition, in, education, and, in, daily, life, and, secondly, to, aid, scientific, men, themselves, by, giving, early, information, of, all, advances, made, in, any, branch, of, natural, knowledge, throughout, the, world, and, by, affording, them, an, opportunity, of, discussing, the, various, scientific, questions, which, arise, from, time, to, time, this, was, later, revised, to, first, to, serve, scientists, through, prompt, publication, of, significant, advances, in, any, branch, of, science, and, to, provide, a, forum, for, the, reporting, and, discussion, of, news, and, issues, concerning, science, second, to, ensure, that, the, results, of, science, are, rapidly, disseminated, to, the, public, throughout, the, world, in, a, fashion, that, conveys, their, significance, for, knowledge, culture, and, daily, life, many, of, the, most, significant, scientific, breakthroughs, in, modern, history, have, been, first, published, in, nature, the, following, is, a, selection, of, scientific, breakthroughs, published, in, nature, all, of, which, had, far, reaching, consequences, and, the, citation, for, the, article, in, which, they, were, published, in, 2017, nature, published, an, editorial, entitled, removing, statues, of, historical, figures, risks, whitewashing, history, science, must, acknowledge, mistakes, as, it, marks, its, past, the, article, commented, on, the, placement, and, maintenance, of, statues, honouring, scientists, with, known, unethical, abusive, and, torturous, histories, specifically, the, editorial, called, on, examples, of, j, marion, sims, the, father, of, gynecology, who, experimented, on, african, american, female, slaves, who, were, unable, to, give, informed, consent, and, thomas, parran, jr, who, oversaw, the, tuskegee, syphilis, experiment, the, editorial, as, written, made, the, case, that, removing, such, statues, and, erasing, names, runs, the, risk, of, whitewashing, history, and, stated, instead, of, removing, painful, reminders, perhaps, these, should, be, supplemented, the, article, caused, a, large, outcry, and, was, quickly, modified, by, nature, the, article, was, largely, seen, as, offensive, inappropriate, and, by, many, racist, nature, acknowledged, that, the, article, as, originally, written, was, offensive, and, poorly, worded, and, published, selected, letters, of, response, the, editorial, came, just, weeks, after, hundreds, of, white, supremacists, marched, in, charlottesville, virginia, in, the, unite, the, right, rally, to, oppose, the, removal, of, a, statue, of, robert, e, lee, setting, off, violence, in, the, streets, and, killing, a, young, woman, when, nature, posted, a, link, to, the, editorial, on, twitter, the, thread, quickly, exploded, with, criticisms, in, response, several, scientists, called, for, a, boycott, on, 18, september, 2017, the, editorial, was, updated, and, edited, by, philip, campbell, the, editor, of, the, journal, when, paul, lauterbur, and, peter, mansfield, won, a, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, research, initially, rejected, by, nature, and, published, only, after, lauterbur, appealed, against, the, rejection, nature, acknowledged, more, of, its, own, missteps, in, rejecting, papers, in, an, editorial, titled, coping, with, peer, rejection, here, are, unarguable, faux, pas, in, our, history, these, include, the, rejection, of, cherenkov, radiation, hideki, yukawa, s, meson, work, on, photosynthesis, by, johann, deisenhofer, robert, huber, and, hartmut, michel, and, the, initial, rejection, but, eventual, acceptance, of, stephen, hawking, s, black, hole, radiation, in, june, 1988, after, nearly, a, year, of, guided, scrutiny, from, its, editors, nature, published, a, controversial, and, seemingly, anomalous, paper, detailing, jacques, benveniste, and, his, team, s, work, studying, water, memory, the, paper, concluded, that, less, than, a, single, molecule, of, antibody, diluted, in, water, could, trigger, an, immune, response, in, human, basophils, defying, the, physical, law, of, mass, action, the, paper, excited, substantial, media, attention, in, paris, chiefly, because, their, research, sought, funding, from, homeopathic, medicine, companies, public, inquiry, prompted, nature, to, mandate, an, extensive, and, stringent, experimental, replication, in, benveniste, s, lab, through, which, his, team, s, results, were, refuted, before, publishing, one, of, its, most, famous, discoveries, watson, and, crick, s, 1953, paper, on, the, structure, of, dna, nature, did, not, send, the, paper, out, for, peer, review, john, maddox, nature, s, editor, stated, the, watson, and, crick, paper, was, not, peer, reviewed, by, nature, the, paper, could, not, have, been, refereed, its, correctness, is, self, evident, no, referee, working, in, the, field, could, have, kept, his, mouth, shut, once, he, saw, the, structure, an, earlier, error, occurred, when, enrico, fermi, submitted, his, breakthrough, paper, on, the, weak, interaction, theory, of, beta, decay, nature, rejected, the, paper, because, it, was, considered, too, remote, from, reality, fermi, s, paper, was, published, by, zeitschrift, f, r, physik, in, 1934, the, journal, apologised, for, its, initial, coverage, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, which, it, linked, china, and, wuhan, with, the, outbreak, which, may, have, led, to, racist, attacks, a, paper, was, published, with, important, figure, anomalies, from, an, author, with, a, past, of, publishing, figure, anomalies, a, 2013, fraudulent, paper, was, also, published, in, nature, from, 2000, to, 2001, a, series, of, five, fraudulent, papers, by, jan, hendrik, sch, n, was, published, in, nature, the, papers, about, semiconductors, were, revealed, to, contain, falsified, data, and, other, scientific, fraud, in, 2003, nature, retracted, the, papers, the, sch, n, scandal, was, not, limited, to, nature, other, prominent, journals, such, as, science, and, physical, review, also, retracted, papers, by, sch, n, in, 2022, an, editorial, published, in, nature, entitled, how, nature, contributed, to, science, s, discriminatory, legacy, mentioning, the, problematics, of, some, of, their, articles, but, we, have, also, published, material, that, contributed, to, bias, exclusion, and, discrimination, in, research, and, society, in, 2024, a, paper, titled, pluripotency, of, mesenchymal, stem, cells, derived, from, adult, marrow, published, in, 2002, was, retracted, due, to, concerns, raised, regarding, some, of, the, panels, shown, in, a, figure, making, it, the, most, cited, retracted, paper, ever, in, 1999, nature, began, publishing, science, fiction, short, stories, the, brief, vignettes, are, printed, in, a, series, called, futures, the, stories, appeared, in, 1999, and, 2000, again, in, 2005, and, 2006, and, have, appeared, weekly, since, july, 2007,
