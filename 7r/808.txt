deforestation, or, forest, clearance, is, the, removal, and, destruction, of, a, forest, or, stand, of, trees, from, land, that, is, then, converted, to, non, forest, use, deforestation, can, involve, conversion, of, forest, land, to, farms, ranches, or, urban, use, about, 31, of, earth, s, land, surface, is, covered, by, forests, at, present, this, is, one, third, less, than, the, forest, cover, before, the, expansion, of, agriculture, with, half, of, that, loss, occurring, in, the, last, century, between, 15, million, to, 18, million, hectares, of, forest, an, area, the, size, of, bangladesh, are, destroyed, every, year, on, average, 2, 400, trees, are, cut, down, each, minute, estimates, vary, widely, as, to, the, extent, of, deforestation, in, the, tropics, in, 2019, nearly, a, third, of, the, overall, tree, cover, loss, or, 3, 8, million, hectares, occurred, within, humid, tropical, primary, forests, these, are, areas, of, mature, rainforest, that, are, especially, important, for, biodiversity, and, carbon, storage, the, direct, cause, of, most, deforestation, is, agriculture, by, far, more, than, 80, of, deforestation, was, attributed, to, agriculture, in, 2018, forests, are, being, converted, to, plantations, for, coffee, palm, oil, rubber, and, various, other, popular, products, livestock, grazing, also, drives, deforestation, further, drivers, are, the, wood, industry, logging, urbanization, and, mining, the, effects, of, climate, change, are, another, cause, via, the, increased, risk, of, wildfires, see, deforestation, and, climate, change, deforestation, results, in, habitat, destruction, which, in, turn, leads, to, biodiversity, loss, deforestation, also, leads, to, extinction, of, animals, and, plants, changes, to, the, local, climate, and, displacement, of, indigenous, people, who, live, in, forests, deforested, regions, often, also, suffer, from, other, environmental, problems, such, as, desertification, and, soil, erosion, another, problem, is, that, deforestation, reduces, the, uptake, of, carbon, dioxide, carbon, sequestration, from, the, atmosphere, this, reduces, the, potential, of, forests, to, assist, with, climate, change, mitigation, the, role, of, forests, in, capturing, and, storing, carbon, and, mitigating, climate, change, is, also, important, for, the, agricultural, sector, the, reason, for, this, linkage, is, because, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, agriculture, pose, new, risks, to, global, food, systems, since, 1990, it, is, estimated, that, some, 420, million, hectares, of, forest, have, been, lost, through, conversion, to, other, land, uses, although, the, rate, of, deforestation, has, decreased, over, the, past, three, decades, between, 2015, and, 2020, the, rate, of, deforestation, was, estimated, at, 10, million, hectares, per, year, down, from, 16, million, hectares, per, year, in, the, 1990s, the, area, of, primary, forest, worldwide, has, decreased, by, over, 80, million, hectares, since, 1990, more, than, 100, million, hectares, of, forests, are, adversely, affected, by, forest, fires, pests, diseases, invasive, species, drought, and, adverse, weather, events, deforestation, is, defined, as, the, conversion, of, forest, to, other, land, uses, regardless, of, whether, it, is, human, induced, deforestation, and, forest, area, net, change, are, not, the, same, the, latter, is, the, sum, of, all, forest, losses, deforestation, and, all, forest, gains, forest, expansion, in, a, given, period, net, change, therefore, can, be, positive, or, negative, depending, on, whether, gains, exceed, losses, or, vice, versa, the, fao, estimates, that, the, global, forest, carbon, stock, has, decreased, 0, 9, and, tree, cover, 4, 2, between, 1990, and, 2020, 16, 52, as, of, 2019, there, is, still, disagreement, about, whether, the, global, forest, is, shrinking, or, not, while, above, ground, biomass, carbon, stocks, are, estimated, to, be, declining, in, the, tropics, they, are, increasing, globally, due, to, increasing, stocks, in, temperate, and, boreal, forest, 385, deforestation, in, many, countries, both, naturally, occurring, and, human, induced, is, an, ongoing, issue, between, 2000, and, 2012, 2, 3, million, square, kilometres, 890, 000, square, miles, of, forests, around, the, world, were, cut, down, deforestation, and, forest, degradation, continue, to, take, place, at, alarming, rates, which, contributes, significantly, to, the, ongoing, loss, of, biodiversity, deforestation, is, more, extreme, in, tropical, and, subtropical, forests, in, emerging, economies, more, than, half, of, all, plant, and, land, animal, species, in, the, world, live, in, tropical, forests, as, a, result, of, deforestation, only, 6, 2, million, square, kilometres, 2, 4, million, square, miles, remain, of, the, original, 16, million, square, kilometres, 6, million, square, miles, of, tropical, rainforest, that, formerly, covered, the, earth, more, than, 3, 6, million, hectares, of, virgin, tropical, forest, was, lost, in, 2018, the, global, annual, net, loss, of, trees, is, estimated, to, be, approximately, 10, billion, according, to, the, global, forest, resources, assessment, 2020, the, global, average, annual, deforested, land, in, the, 2015, 2020, demi, decade, was, 10, million, hectares, and, the, average, annual, forest, area, net, loss, in, the, 2000, 2010, decade, was, 4, 7, million, hectares, the, world, has, lost, 178, million, ha, of, forest, since, 1990, which, is, an, area, about, the, size, of, libya, an, analysis, of, global, deforestation, patterns, in, 2021, showed, that, patterns, of, trade, production, and, consumption, drive, deforestation, rates, in, complex, ways, while, the, location, of, deforestation, can, be, mapped, it, does, not, always, match, where, the, commodity, is, consumed, for, example, consumption, patterns, in, g7, countries, are, estimated, to, cause, an, average, loss, of, 3, 9, trees, per, person, per, year, in, other, words, deforestation, can, be, directly, related, to, imports, for, example, coffee, in, 2023, the, global, forest, watch, reported, a, 9, decline, in, tropical, primary, forest, loss, compared, to, the, previous, year, with, significant, regional, reductions, in, brazil, and, colombia, overshadowed, by, increases, elsewhere, leading, to, a, 3, 2, rise, in, global, deforestation, massive, wildfires, in, canada, exacerbated, by, climate, change, contributed, to, a, 24, increase, in, global, tree, cover, loss, highlighting, the, ongoing, threats, to, forests, essential, for, carbon, storage, and, biodiversity, despite, some, progress, the, overall, trends, in, forest, destruction, and, climate, impacts, remain, off, track, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, stated, in, 2022, over, 420, million, ha, of, forest, were, lost, to, deforestation, from, 1990, to, 2020, more, than, 90, of, that, loss, took, place, in, tropical, areas, high, confidence, threatening, biodiversity, environmental, services, livelihoods, of, forest, communities, and, resilience, to, climate, shocks, high, confidence, see, also, global, deforestation, sharply, accelerated, around, 1852, as, of, 1947, the, planet, had, 15, to, 16, million, km, 2, 5, 8, to, 6, 2, million, sq, mi, of, mature, tropical, forests, but, by, 2015, it, was, estimated, that, about, half, of, these, had, been, destroyed, total, land, coverage, by, tropical, rainforests, decreased, from, 14, to, 6, much, of, this, loss, happened, between, 1960, and, 1990, when, 20, of, all, tropical, rainforests, were, destroyed, at, this, rate, extinction, of, such, forests, is, projected, to, occur, by, the, mid, 21st, century, in, the, early, 2000s, some, scientists, predicted, that, unless, significant, measures, such, as, seeking, out, and, protecting, old, growth, forests, that, have, not, been, disturbed, are, taken, on, a, worldwide, basis, by, 2030, there, will, only, be, 10, remaining, with, another, 10, in, a, degraded, condition, 80, will, have, been, lost, and, with, them, hundreds, of, thousands, of, irreplaceable, species, estimates, vary, widely, as, to, the, extent, of, deforestation, in, the, tropics, in, 2019, the, world, lost, nearly, 12, million, hectares, of, tree, cover, nearly, a, third, of, that, loss, 3, 8, million, hectares, occurred, within, humid, tropical, primary, forests, areas, of, mature, rainforest, that, are, especially, important, for, biodiversity, and, carbon, storage, this, is, equivalent, to, losing, an, area, of, primary, forest, the, size, of, a, football, pitch, every, six, seconds, a, 2002, analysis, of, satellite, imagery, suggested, that, the, rate, of, deforestation, in, the, humid, tropics, approximately, 5, 8, million, hectares, per, year, was, roughly, 23, lower, than, the, most, commonly, quoted, rates, a, 2005, report, by, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, estimated, that, although, the, earth, s, total, forest, area, continued, to, decrease, at, about, 13, million, hectares, per, year, the, global, rate, of, deforestation, had, been, slowing, on, the, other, hand, a, 2005, analysis, of, satellite, images, reveals, that, deforestation, of, the, amazon, rainforest, is, twice, as, fast, as, scientists, previously, estimated, from, 2010, to, 2015, worldwide, forest, area, decreased, by, 3, 3, million, ha, per, year, according, to, fao, during, this, five, year, period, the, biggest, forest, area, loss, occurred, in, the, tropics, particularly, in, south, america, and, africa, per, capita, forest, area, decline, was, also, greatest, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, but, is, occurring, in, every, climatic, domain, except, in, the, temperate, as, populations, increase, an, estimated, 420, million, ha, of, forest, has, been, lost, worldwide, through, deforestation, since, 1990, but, the, rate, of, forest, loss, has, declined, substantially, in, the, most, recent, five, year, period, 2015, 2020, the, annual, rate, of, deforestation, was, estimated, at, 10, million, ha, down, from, 12, million, ha, in, 2010, 2015, africa, had, the, largest, annual, rate, of, net, forest, loss, in, 2010, 2020, at, 3, 9, million, ha, followed, by, south, america, at, 2, 6, million, ha, the, rate, of, net, forest, loss, has, increased, in, africa, in, each, of, the, three, decades, since, 1990, it, has, declined, substantially, in, south, america, however, to, about, half, the, rate, in, 2010, 2020, compared, with, 2000, 2010, asia, had, the, highest, net, gain, of, forest, area, in, 2010, 2020, followed, by, oceania, and, europe, nevertheless, both, europe, and, asia, recorded, substantially, lower, rates, of, net, gain, in, 2010, 2020, than, in, 2000, 2010, oceania, experienced, net, losses, of, forest, area, in, the, decades, 1990, 2000, and, 2000, 2010, some, claim, that, rainforests, are, being, destroyed, at, an, ever, quickening, pace, the, london, based, rainforest, foundation, notes, that, the, un, figure, is, based, on, a, definition, of, forest, as, being, an, area, with, as, little, as, 10, actual, tree, cover, which, would, therefore, include, areas, that, are, actually, savanna, like, ecosystems, and, badly, damaged, forests, other, critics, of, the, fao, data, point, out, that, they, do, not, distinguish, between, forest, types, and, that, they, are, based, largely, on, reporting, from, forestry, departments, of, individual, countries, which, do, not, take, into, account, unofficial, activities, like, illegal, logging, despite, these, uncertainties, there, is, agreement, that, destruction, of, rainforests, remains, a, significant, environmental, problem, the, rate, of, net, forest, loss, declined, from, 7, 8, million, ha, per, year, in, the, decade, 1990, 2000, to, 5, 2, million, ha, per, year, in, 2000, 2010, and, 4, 7, million, ha, per, year, in, 2010, 2020, the, rate, of, decline, of, net, forest, loss, slowed, in, the, most, recent, decade, due, to, a, reduction, in, the, rate, of, forest, expansion, in, many, parts, of, the, world, especially, in, east, asian, countries, reforestation, and, afforestation, are, increasing, the, area, of, forested, lands, the, amount, of, forest, has, increased, in, 22, of, the, world, s, 50, most, forested, nations, asia, as, a, whole, gained, 1, million, hectares, of, forest, between, 2000, and, 2005, tropical, forest, in, el, salvador, expanded, more, than, 20, between, 1992, and, 2001, based, on, these, trends, one, study, projects, that, global, forestation, will, increase, by, 10, an, area, the, size, of, india, by, 2050, 36, of, globally, planted, forest, area, is, in, east, asia, around, 950, 000, square, kilometers, from, those, 87, are, in, china, rates, of, deforestation, vary, around, the, world, up, to, 90, of, west, africa, s, coastal, rainforests, have, disappeared, since, 1900, madagascar, has, lost, 90, of, its, eastern, rainforests, in, south, asia, about, 88, of, the, rainforests, have, been, lost, mexico, india, the, philippines, indonesia, thailand, burma, malaysia, bangladesh, china, sri, lanka, laos, nigeria, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, liberia, guinea, ghana, and, the, ivory, coast, have, lost, large, areas, of, their, rainforest, much, of, what, remains, of, the, world, s, rainforests, is, in, the, amazon, basin, where, the, amazon, rainforest, covers, approximately, 4, million, square, kilometres, some, 80, of, the, deforestation, of, the, amazon, can, be, attributed, to, cattle, ranching, as, brazil, is, the, largest, exporter, of, beef, in, the, world, the, amazon, region, has, become, one, of, the, largest, cattle, ranching, territories, in, the, world, the, regions, with, the, highest, tropical, deforestation, rate, between, 2000, and, 2005, were, central, america, which, lost, 1, 3, of, its, forests, each, year, and, tropical, asia, in, central, america, two, thirds, of, lowland, tropical, forests, have, been, turned, into, pasture, since, 1950, and, 40, of, all, the, rainforests, have, been, lost, in, the, last, 40, years, brazil, has, lost, 90, 95, of, its, mata, atl, ntica, forest, deforestation, in, brazil, increased, by, 88, for, the, month, of, june, 2019, as, compared, with, the, previous, year, however, brazil, still, destroyed, 1, 3, million, hectares, in, 2019, brazil, is, one, of, several, countries, that, have, declared, their, deforestation, a, national, emergency, paraguay, was, losing, its, natural, semi, humid, forests, in, the, country, s, western, regions, at, a, rate, of, 15, 000, hectares, at, a, randomly, studied, 2, month, period, in, 2010, in, 2009, paraguay, s, parliament, refused, to, pass, a, law, that, would, have, stopped, cutting, of, natural, forests, altogether, as, of, 2007, less, than, 50, of, haiti, s, forests, remained, from, 2015, to, 2019, the, rate, of, deforestation, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, doubled, in, 2021, deforestation, of, the, congolese, rainforest, increased, by, 5, the, world, wildlife, fund, s, ecoregion, project, catalogues, habitat, types, throughout, the, world, including, habitat, loss, such, as, deforestation, showing, for, example, that, even, in, the, rich, forests, of, parts, of, canada, such, as, the, mid, continental, canadian, forests, of, the, prairie, provinces, half, of, the, forest, cover, has, been, lost, or, altered, in, 2011, conservation, international, listed, the, top, 10, most, endangered, forests, characterized, by, having, all, lost, 90, or, more, of, their, original, habitat, and, each, harboring, at, least, 1500, endemic, plant, species, species, found, nowhere, else, in, the, world, as, of, 2015, it, is, estimated, that, 70, of, the, world, s, forests, are, within, one, kilometer, of, a, forest, edge, where, they, are, most, prone, to, human, interference, and, destruction, deforestation, in, particular, countries, agricultural, expansion, continues, to, be, the, main, driver, of, deforestation, and, forest, fragmentation, and, the, associated, loss, of, forest, biodiversity, large, scale, commercial, agriculture, primarily, cattle, ranching, and, cultivation, of, soya, bean, and, oil, palm, accounted, for, 40, percent, of, tropical, deforestation, between, 2000, and, 2010, and, local, subsistence, agriculture, for, another, 33, percent, trees, are, cut, down, for, use, as, building, material, timber, or, sold, as, fuel, sometimes, in, the, form, of, charcoal, or, timber, while, cleared, land, is, used, as, pasture, for, livestock, and, agricultural, crops, the, vast, majority, of, agricultural, activity, resulting, in, deforestation, is, subsidized, by, government, tax, revenue, disregard, of, ascribed, value, lax, forest, management, and, deficient, environmental, laws, are, some, of, the, factors, that, lead, to, large, scale, deforestation, the, types, of, drivers, vary, greatly, depending, on, the, region, in, which, they, take, place, the, regions, with, the, greatest, amount, of, deforestation, for, livestock, and, row, crop, agriculture, are, central, and, south, america, while, commodity, crop, deforestation, was, found, mainly, in, southeast, asia, the, region, with, the, greatest, forest, loss, due, to, shifting, agriculture, was, sub, saharan, africa, the, overwhelming, direct, cause, of, deforestation, is, agriculture, subsistence, farming, is, responsible, for, 48, of, deforestation, commercial, agriculture, is, responsible, for, 32, logging, is, responsible, for, 14, and, fuel, wood, removals, make, up, 5, more, than, 80, of, deforestation, was, attributed, to, agriculture, in, 2018, forests, are, being, converted, to, plantations, for, coffee, tea, palm, oil, rice, rubber, and, various, other, popular, products, the, rising, demand, for, certain, products, and, global, trade, arrangements, causes, forest, conversions, which, ultimately, leads, to, soil, erosion, the, top, soil, oftentimes, erodes, after, forests, are, cleared, which, leads, to, sediment, increase, in, rivers, and, streams, most, deforestation, also, occurs, in, tropical, regions, the, estimated, amount, of, total, land, mass, used, by, agriculture, is, around, 38, since, 1960, roughly, 15, of, the, amazon, has, been, removed, with, the, intention, of, replacing, the, land, with, agricultural, practices, it, is, no, coincidence, that, brazil, has, recently, become, the, world, s, largest, beef, exporter, at, the, same, time, that, the, amazon, rainforest, is, being, clear, cut, another, prevalent, method, of, agricultural, deforestation, is, slash, and, burn, agriculture, which, was, primarily, used, by, subsistence, farmers, in, tropical, regions, but, has, now, become, increasingly, less, sustainable, the, method, does, not, leave, land, for, continuous, agricultural, production, but, instead, cuts, and, burns, small, plots, of, forest, land, which, are, then, converted, into, agricultural, zones, the, farmers, then, exploit, the, nutrients, in, the, ashes, of, the, burned, plants, as, well, as, intentionally, set, fires, can, possibly, lead, to, devastating, measures, when, unintentionally, spreading, fire, to, more, land, which, can, result, in, the, destruction, of, the, protective, canopy, the, repeated, cycle, of, low, yields, and, shortened, fallow, periods, eventually, results, in, less, vegetation, being, able, to, grow, on, once, burned, lands, and, a, decrease, in, average, soil, biomass, in, small, local, plots, sustainability, is, not, an, issue, because, of, longer, fallow, periods, and, lesser, overall, deforestation, the, relatively, small, size, of, the, plots, allowed, for, no, net, input, of, co, 2, to, be, released, consumption, and, production, of, beef, is, the, primary, driver, of, deforestation, in, the, amazon, with, around, 80, of, all, converted, land, being, used, to, rear, cattle, 91, of, amazon, land, deforested, since, 1970, has, been, converted, to, cattle, ranching, livestock, ranching, requires, large, portions, of, land, to, raise, herds, of, animals, and, livestock, crops, for, consumer, needs, according, to, the, world, wildlife, fund, extensive, cattle, ranching, is, the, number, one, culprit, of, deforestation, in, virtually, every, amazon, country, and, it, accounts, for, 80, of, current, deforestation, the, cattle, industry, is, responsible, for, a, significant, amount, of, methane, emissions, since, 60, of, all, mammals, on, earth, are, livestock, cows, replacing, forest, land, with, pastures, creates, a, loss, of, forest, stock, which, leads, to, the, implication, of, increased, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, burning, agriculture, methodologies, and, land, use, change, a, large, contributing, factor, to, deforestation, is, the, lumber, industry, a, total, of, almost, 4, million, hectares, 9, 9, million, acres, of, timber, or, about, 1, 3, of, all, forest, land, is, harvested, each, year, in, addition, the, increasing, demand, for, low, cost, timber, products, only, supports, the, lumber, company, to, continue, logging, experts, do, not, agree, on, whether, industrial, logging, is, an, important, contributor, to, global, deforestation, some, argue, that, poor, people, are, more, likely, to, clear, forest, because, they, have, no, alternatives, others, that, the, poor, lack, the, ability, to, pay, for, the, materials, and, labour, needed, to, clear, forest, other, causes, of, contemporary, deforestation, may, include, corruption, of, government, institutions, the, inequitable, distribution, of, wealth, and, power, population, growth, and, overpopulation, and, urbanization, the, impact, of, population, growth, on, deforestation, has, been, contested, one, study, found, that, population, increases, due, to, high, fertility, rates, were, a, primary, driver, of, tropical, deforestation, in, only, 8, of, cases, in, 2000, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, found, that, the, role, of, population, dynamics, in, a, local, setting, may, vary, from, decisive, to, negligible, and, that, deforestation, can, result, from, a, combination, of, population, pressure, and, stagnating, economic, social, and, technological, conditions, globalization, is, often, viewed, as, another, root, cause, of, deforestation, though, there, are, cases, in, which, the, impacts, of, globalization, new, flows, of, labor, capital, commodities, and, ideas, have, promoted, localized, forest, recovery, the, degradation, of, forest, ecosystems, has, also, been, traced, to, economic, incentives, that, make, forest, conversion, appear, more, profitable, than, forest, conservation, many, important, forest, functions, have, no, markets, and, hence, no, economic, value, that, is, readily, apparent, to, the, forests, owners, or, the, communities, that, rely, on, forests, for, their, well, being, some, commentators, have, noted, a, shift, in, the, drivers, of, deforestation, over, the, past, 30, years, whereas, deforestation, was, primarily, driven, by, subsistence, activities, and, government, sponsored, development, projects, like, transmigration, in, countries, like, indonesia, and, colonization, in, latin, america, india, java, and, so, on, during, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, by, the, 1990s, the, majority, of, deforestation, was, caused, by, industrial, factors, including, extractive, industries, large, scale, cattle, ranching, and, extensive, agriculture, since, 2001, commodity, driven, deforestation, which, is, more, likely, to, be, permanent, has, accounted, for, about, a, quarter, of, all, forest, disturbance, and, this, loss, has, been, concentrated, in, south, america, and, southeast, asia, as, the, human, population, grows, new, homes, communities, and, expansions, of, cities, will, occur, leading, to, an, increase, in, roads, to, connect, these, communities, rural, roads, promote, economic, development, but, also, facilitate, deforestation, about, 90, of, the, deforestation, has, occurred, within, 100, km, of, roads, in, most, parts, of, the, amazon, the, importance, of, mining, as, a, cause, of, deforestation, increased, quickly, in, the, beginning, the, 21st, century, among, other, because, of, increased, demand, for, minerals, the, direct, impact, of, mining, is, relatively, small, but, the, indirect, impacts, are, much, more, significant, more, than, a, third, of, the, earth, s, forests, are, possibly, impacted, at, some, level, and, in, the, years, 2001, 2021, 755, 861, km, 2, had, been, deforested, by, causes, indirectly, related, to, mining, activities, alongside, other, deforestation, drivers, based, on, data, from, wwf, another, cause, of, deforestation, is, due, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, more, wildfires, insect, outbreaks, invasive, species, and, more, frequent, extreme, weather, events, such, as, storms, are, factors, that, increase, deforestation, a, study, suggests, that, tropical, arid, and, temperate, forests, are, experiencing, a, significant, decline, in, resilience, probably, related, to, increased, water, limitations, and, climate, variability, which, may, shift, ecosystems, towards, critical, transitions, and, ecosystem, collapses, by, contrast, boreal, forests, show, divergent, local, patterns, with, an, average, increasing, trend, in, resilience, probably, benefiting, from, warming, and, co, 2, fertilization, which, may, outweigh, the, adverse, effects, of, climate, change, it, has, been, proposed, that, a, loss, of, resilience, in, forests, can, be, detected, from, the, increased, temporal, autocorrelation, tac, in, the, state, of, the, system, reflecting, a, decline, in, recovery, rates, due, to, the, critical, slowing, down, csd, of, system, processes, that, occur, at, thresholds, 23, of, tree, cover, losses, result, from, wildfires, and, climate, change, increase, their, frequency, and, power, the, rising, temperatures, cause, massive, wildfires, especially, in, the, boreal, forests, one, possible, effect, is, the, change, of, the, forest, composition, deforestation, can, also, cause, forests, to, become, more, fire, prone, through, mechanisms, such, as, logging, operations, in, war, can, also, cause, deforestation, for, example, in, the, 1945, battle, of, okinawa, bombardment, and, other, combat, operations, reduced, a, lush, tropical, landscape, into, a, vast, field, of, mud, lead, decay, and, maggots, deforestation, can, also, result, from, the, intentional, tactics, of, military, forces, clearing, forests, became, an, element, in, the, russian, empire, s, successful, conquest, of, the, caucasus, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, british, during, the, malayan, emergency, and, the, united, states, in, the, korean, war, and, in, the, vietnam, war, used, defoliants, like, agent, orange, or, others, the, destruction, of, forests, in, vietnam, war, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, examples, of, ecocide, including, by, swedish, prime, minister, olof, palme, lawyers, historians, and, other, academics, deforestation, is, a, major, contributor, to, climate, change, it, is, often, cited, as, one, of, the, major, causes, of, the, enhanced, greenhouse, effect, recent, calculations, suggest, that, co, 2, emissions, from, deforestation, and, forest, degradation, excluding, peatland, emissions, contribute, about, 12, of, total, anthropogenic, co, 2, emissions, with, a, range, from, 6, to, 17, a, 2022, study, shows, annual, carbon, emissions, from, tropical, deforestation, have, doubled, during, the, last, two, decades, and, continue, to, increase, by, 0, 97, 0, 16, pgc, petagrams, of, carbon, i, e, billions, of, tons, per, year, in, 2001, 2005, to, 1, 99, 0, 13, pgc, per, year, in, 2015, 2019, according, to, a, review, north, of, 50, n, large, scale, deforestation, leads, to, an, overall, net, global, cooling, but, deforestation, in, the, tropics, leads, to, substantial, warming, not, just, due, to, co, 2, impacts, but, also, due, to, other, biophysical, mechanisms, making, carbon, centric, metrics, inadequate, moreover, it, suggests, that, standing, tropical, forests, help, cool, the, average, global, temperature, by, more, than, 1, c, according, to, a, later, study, deforestation, in, northern, latitudes, can, also, increase, warming, while, the, conclusion, about, cooling, from, deforestation, in, these, areas, made, by, previous, studies, results, from, the, failure, of, models, to, properly, capture, the, effects, of, evapotranspiration, the, incineration, and, burning, of, forest, plants, to, clear, land, releases, large, amounts, of, co, 2, which, contributes, to, global, warming, scientists, also, state, that, tropical, deforestation, releases, 1, 5, billion, tons, of, carbon, each, year, into, the, atmosphere, a, study, suggests, logged, and, structurally, degraded, tropical, forests, are, carbon, sources, for, at, least, a, decade, even, when, recovering, due, to, larger, carbon, losses, from, soil, organic, matter, and, deadwood, indicating, that, the, tropical, forest, carbon, sink, at, least, in, south, asia, may, be, much, smaller, than, previously, estimated, contradicting, that, recovering, logged, and, degraded, tropical, forests, are, net, carbon, sinks, forests, are, an, important, part, of, the, global, carbon, cycle, because, trees, and, plants, absorb, carbon, dioxide, through, photosynthesis, therefore, they, play, an, important, role, in, climate, change, mitigation, 37, by, removing, the, greenhouse, gas, carbon, dioxide, from, the, air, forests, function, as, terrestrial, carbon, sinks, meaning, they, store, large, amounts, of, carbon, in, the, form, of, biomass, encompassing, roots, stems, branches, and, leaves, throughout, their, lifespan, trees, continue, to, sequester, carbon, storing, atmospheric, co, 2, long, term, sustainable, forest, management, afforestation, reforestation, are, therefore, important, contributions, to, climate, change, mitigation, an, important, consideration, in, such, efforts, is, that, forests, can, turn, from, sinks, to, carbon, sources, in, 2019, forests, took, up, a, third, less, carbon, than, they, did, in, the, 1990s, due, to, higher, temperatures, droughts, and, deforestation, the, typical, tropical, forest, may, become, a, carbon, source, by, the, 2060s, researchers, have, found, that, in, terms, of, environmental, services, it, is, better, to, avoid, deforestation, than, to, allow, for, deforestation, to, subsequently, reforest, as, the, former, leads, to, irreversible, effects, in, terms, of, biodiversity, loss, and, soil, degradation, furthermore, the, probability, that, legacy, carbon, will, be, released, from, soil, is, higher, in, younger, boreal, forest, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, caused, by, damage, to, tropical, rainforests, may, have, been, substantially, underestimated, until, around, 2019, additionally, the, effects, of, afforestation, and, reforestation, will, be, farther, in, the, future, than, keeping, existing, forests, intact, it, takes, much, longer, several, decades, for, the, benefits, for, global, warming, to, manifest, to, the, same, carbon, sequestration, benefits, from, mature, trees, in, tropical, forests, and, hence, from, limiting, deforestation, therefore, scientists, consider, the, protection, and, recovery, of, carbon, rich, and, long, lived, ecosystems, especially, natural, forests, to, be, the, major, climate, solution, the, planting, of, trees, on, marginal, crop, and, pasture, lands, helps, to, incorporate, carbon, from, atmospheric, co, 2, into, biomass, for, this, carbon, sequestration, process, to, succeed, the, carbon, must, not, return, to, the, atmosphere, from, biomass, burning, or, rotting, when, the, trees, die, to, this, end, land, allotted, to, the, trees, must, not, be, converted, to, other, uses, alternatively, the, wood, from, them, must, itself, be, sequestered, e, g, via, biochar, bioenergy, with, carbon, capture, and, storage, landfill, or, stored, by, use, in, construction, earth, offers, enough, room, to, plant, an, additional, 0, 9, billion, ha, of, tree, canopy, cover, planting, and, protecting, these, trees, would, sequester, 205, billion, tons, of, carbon, to, put, this, number, into, perspective, this, is, about, 20, years, of, current, global, carbon, emissions, as, of, 2019, this, level, of, sequestration, would, represent, about, 25, of, the, atmosphere, s, carbon, pool, in, 2019, life, expectancy, of, forests, varies, throughout, the, world, influenced, by, tree, species, site, conditions, and, natural, disturbance, patterns, in, some, forests, carbon, may, be, stored, for, centuries, while, in, other, forests, carbon, is, released, with, frequent, stand, replacing, fires, forests, that, are, harvested, prior, to, stand, replacing, events, allow, for, the, retention, of, carbon, in, manufactured, forest, products, such, as, lumber, however, only, a, portion, of, the, carbon, removed, from, logged, forests, ends, up, as, durable, goods, and, buildings, the, remainder, ends, up, as, sawmill, by, products, such, as, pulp, paper, and, pallets, if, all, new, construction, globally, utilized, 90, wood, products, largely, via, adoption, of, mass, timber, in, low, rise, construction, this, could, sequester, 700, million, net, tons, of, carbon, per, year, this, is, in, addition, to, the, elimination, of, carbon, emissions, from, the, displaced, construction, material, such, as, steel, or, concrete, which, are, carbon, intense, to, produce, a, meta, analysis, found, that, mixed, species, plantations, would, increase, carbon, storage, alongside, other, benefits, of, diversifying, planted, forests, although, a, bamboo, forest, stores, less, total, carbon, than, a, mature, forest, of, trees, a, bamboo, plantation, sequesters, carbon, at, a, much, faster, rate, than, a, mature, forest, or, a, tree, plantation, therefore, the, farming, of, bamboo, timber, may, have, significant, carbon, sequestration, potential, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, reported, that, the, total, carbon, stock, in, forests, decreased, from, 668, gigatonnes, in, 1990, to, 662, gigatonnes, in, 2020, 11, in, canada, s, boreal, forests, as, much, as, 80, of, the, total, carbon, is, stored, in, the, soils, as, dead, organic, matter, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, says, secondary, forest, regrowth, and, restoration, of, degraded, forests, and, non, forest, ecosystems, can, play, a, large, role, in, carbon, sequestration, high, confidence, with, high, resilience, to, disturbances, and, additional, benefits, such, as, enhanced, biodiversity, impacts, on, temperature, are, affected, by, the, location, of, the, forest, for, example, reforestation, in, boreal, or, subarctic, regions, has, less, impact, on, climate, this, is, because, it, substitutes, a, high, albedo, snow, dominated, region, with, a, lower, albedo, forest, canopy, by, contrast, tropical, reforestation, projects, lead, to, a, positive, change, such, as, the, formation, of, clouds, these, clouds, then, reflect, the, sunlight, lowering, temperatures, 1457, according, to, a, 2020, study, if, deforestation, continues, at, current, rates, it, can, trigger, a, total, or, almost, total, extinction, of, humanity, in, the, next, 20, to, 40, years, they, conclude, that, from, a, statistical, point, of, view, the, probability, that, our, civilisation, survives, itself, is, less, than, 10, in, the, most, optimistic, scenario, to, avoid, this, collapse, humanity, should, pass, from, a, civilization, dominated, by, the, economy, to, cultural, society, that, privileges, the, interest, of, the, ecosystem, above, the, individual, interest, of, its, components, but, eventually, in, accordance, with, the, overall, communal, interest, the, water, cycle, is, also, affected, by, deforestation, trees, extract, groundwater, through, their, roots, and, release, it, into, the, atmosphere, when, part, of, a, forest, is, removed, the, trees, no, longer, transpire, this, water, resulting, in, a, much, drier, climate, deforestation, reduces, the, content, of, water, in, the, soil, and, groundwater, as, well, as, atmospheric, moisture, the, dry, soil, leads, to, lower, water, intake, for, the, trees, to, extract, deforestation, reduces, soil, cohesion, so, that, erosion, flooding, and, landslides, ensue, shrinking, forest, cover, lessens, the, landscape, s, capacity, to, intercept, retain, and, transpire, precipitation, instead, of, trapping, precipitation, which, then, percolates, to, groundwater, systems, deforested, areas, become, sources, of, surface, water, runoff, which, moves, much, faster, than, subsurface, flows, forests, return, most, of, the, water, that, falls, as, precipitation, to, the, atmosphere, by, transpiration, in, contrast, when, an, area, is, deforested, almost, all, precipitation, is, lost, as, run, off, that, quicker, transport, of, surface, water, can, translate, into, flash, flooding, and, more, localized, floods, than, would, occur, with, the, forest, cover, deforestation, also, contributes, to, decreased, evapotranspiration, which, lessens, atmospheric, moisture, which, in, some, cases, affects, precipitation, levels, downwind, from, the, deforested, area, as, water, is, not, recycled, to, downwind, forests, but, is, lost, in, runoff, and, returns, directly, to, the, oceans, according, to, one, study, in, deforested, north, and, northwest, china, the, average, annual, precipitation, decreased, by, one, third, between, the, 1950s, and, the, 1980s, trees, and, plants, in, general, affect, the, water, cycle, significantly, as, a, result, the, presence, or, absence, of, trees, can, change, the, quantity, of, water, on, the, surface, in, the, soil, or, groundwater, or, in, the, atmosphere, this, in, turn, changes, erosion, rates, and, the, availability, of, water, for, either, ecosystem, functions, or, human, services, deforestation, on, lowland, plains, moves, cloud, formation, and, rainfall, to, higher, elevations, the, forest, may, have, little, impact, on, flooding, in, the, case, of, large, rainfall, events, which, overwhelm, the, storage, capacity, of, forest, soil, if, the, soils, are, at, or, close, to, saturation, tropical, rainforests, produce, about, 30, of, earth, s, fresh, water, deforestation, disrupts, normal, weather, patterns, creating, hotter, and, drier, weather, thus, increasing, drought, desertification, crop, failures, melting, of, the, polar, ice, caps, coastal, flooding, and, displacement, of, major, vegetation, regimes, due, to, surface, plant, litter, forests, that, are, undisturbed, have, a, minimal, rate, of, erosion, the, rate, of, erosion, occurs, from, deforestation, because, it, decreases, the, amount, of, litter, cover, which, provides, protection, from, surface, runoff, the, rate, of, erosion, is, around, 2, metric, tons, per, square, kilometre, this, can, be, an, advantage, in, excessively, leached, tropical, rain, forest, soils, forestry, operations, themselves, also, increase, erosion, through, the, development, of, forest, roads, and, the, use, of, mechanized, equipment, deforestation, in, china, s, loess, plateau, many, years, ago, has, led, to, soil, erosion, this, erosion, has, led, to, valleys, opening, up, the, increase, of, soil, in, the, runoff, causes, the, yellow, river, to, flood, and, makes, it, yellow, colored, greater, erosion, is, not, always, a, consequence, of, deforestation, as, observed, in, the, southwestern, regions, of, the, us, in, these, areas, the, loss, of, grass, due, to, the, presence, of, trees, and, other, shrubbery, leads, to, more, erosion, than, when, trees, are, removed, soils, are, reinforced, by, the, presence, of, trees, which, secure, the, soil, by, binding, their, roots, to, soil, bedrock, due, to, deforestation, the, removal, of, trees, causes, sloped, lands, to, be, more, susceptible, to, landslides, clearing, forests, changes, the, environment, of, the, microbial, communities, within, the, soil, and, causes, a, loss, of, biodiversity, in, regards, to, the, microbes, since, biodiversity, is, actually, highly, dependent, on, soil, texture, although, the, effect, of, deforestation, has, much, more, profound, consequences, on, sandier, soils, compared, to, clay, like, soils, the, disruptions, caused, by, deforestation, ultimately, reduces, properties, of, soil, such, as, hydraulic, conductivity, and, water, storage, thus, reducing, the, efficiency, of, water, and, heat, absorption, in, a, simulation, of, the, deforestation, process, in, the, amazon, researchers, found, that, surface, and, soil, temperatures, increased, by, 1, to, 3, degrees, celsius, demonstrating, the, loss, of, the, soil, s, ability, to, absorb, radiation, and, moisture, furthermore, soils, that, are, rich, in, organic, decay, matter, are, more, susceptible, to, fire, especially, during, long, droughts, changes, in, soil, properties, could, turn, the, soil, itself, into, a, carbon, source, rather, than, a, carbon, sink, deforestation, on, a, human, scale, results, in, decline, in, biodiversity, and, on, a, natural, global, scale, is, known, to, cause, the, extinction, of, many, species, the, removal, or, destruction, of, areas, of, forest, cover, has, resulted, in, a, degraded, environment, with, reduced, biodiversity, forests, support, biodiversity, providing, habitat, for, wildlife, moreover, forests, foster, medicinal, conservation, with, forest, biotopes, being, irreplaceable, source, of, new, drugs, such, as, taxol, deforestation, can, destroy, genetic, variations, such, as, crop, resistance, irretrievably, since, the, tropical, rainforests, are, the, most, diverse, ecosystems, on, earth, and, about, 80, of, the, world, s, known, biodiversity, can, be, found, in, tropical, rainforests, removal, or, destruction, of, significant, areas, of, forest, cover, has, resulted, in, a, degraded, environment, with, reduced, biodiversity, road, construction, and, development, of, adjacent, land, which, greatly, reduces, the, area, of, intact, wilderness, and, causes, soil, erosion, is, a, major, contributing, factor, to, the, loss, of, biodiversity, in, tropical, regions, a, study, in, rond, nia, brazil, has, shown, that, deforestation, also, removes, the, microbial, community, which, is, involved, in, the, recycling, of, nutrients, the, production, of, clean, water, and, the, removal, of, pollutants, it, has, been, estimated, that, 137, plant, animal, and, insect, species, go, extinct, every, day, due, to, rainforest, deforestation, which, equates, to, 50, 000, species, a, year, others, state, that, tropical, rainforest, deforestation, is, contributing, to, the, ongoing, holocene, mass, extinction, the, known, extinction, rates, from, deforestation, rates, are, very, low, approximately, one, species, per, year, from, mammals, and, birds, which, extrapolates, to, approximately, 23, 000, species, per, year, for, all, species, predictions, have, been, made, that, more, than, 40, of, the, animal, and, plant, species, in, southeast, asia, could, be, wiped, out, in, the, 21st, century, such, predictions, were, called, into, question, by, 1995, data, that, show, that, within, regions, of, southeast, asia, much, of, the, original, forest, has, been, converted, to, monospecific, plantations, but, that, potentially, endangered, species, are, few, and, tree, flora, remains, widespread, and, stable, scientific, understanding, of, the, process, of, extinction, is, insufficient, to, accurately, make, predictions, about, the, impact, of, deforestation, on, biodiversity, most, predictions, of, forestry, related, biodiversity, loss, are, based, on, species, area, models, with, an, underlying, assumption, that, as, the, forest, declines, species, diversity, will, decline, similarly, however, many, such, models, have, been, proven, to, be, wrong, and, loss, of, habitat, does, not, necessarily, lead, to, large, scale, loss, of, species, species, area, models, are, known, to, overpredict, the, number, of, species, known, to, be, threatened, in, areas, where, actual, deforestation, is, ongoing, and, greatly, overpredict, the, number, of, threatened, species, that, are, widespread, in, 2012, a, study, of, the, brazilian, amazon, predicts, that, despite, a, lack, of, extinctions, thus, far, up, to, 90, percent, of, predicted, extinctions, will, finally, occur, in, the, next, 40, years, rainforests, are, widely, believed, by, lay, persons, to, contribute, a, significant, amount, of, the, world, s, oxygen, although, it, is, now, accepted, by, scientists, that, rainforests, contribute, little, net, oxygen, to, the, atmosphere, and, deforestation, has, only, a, minor, effect, on, atmospheric, oxygen, levels, in, fact, about, 50, percent, of, oxygen, on, earth, is, produced, by, algae, deforestation, reduces, safe, working, hours, for, millions, of, people, in, the, tropics, especially, for, those, performing, heavy, labour, outdoors, continued, global, heating, and, forest, loss, is, expected, to, amplify, these, impacts, reducing, work, hours, for, vulnerable, groups, even, more, a, study, conducted, from, 2002, to, 2018, also, determined, that, the, increase, in, temperature, as, a, result, of, climate, change, and, the, lack, of, shade, due, to, deforestation, has, increased, the, mortality, rate, of, workers, in, indonesia, deforestation, eliminates, a, great, number, of, species, of, plants, and, animals, which, also, often, results, in, exposure, of, people, to, zoonotic, diseases, forest, associated, diseases, include, malaria, chagas, disease, also, known, as, american, trypanosomiasis, african, trypanosomiasis, sleeping, sickness, leishmaniasis, lyme, disease, hiv, and, ebola, the, majority, of, new, infectious, diseases, affecting, humans, including, the, sars, cov, 2, virus, that, caused, the, covid, 19, pandemic, are, zoonotic, and, their, emergence, may, be, linked, to, habitat, loss, due, to, forest, area, change, and, the, expansion, of, human, populations, into, forest, areas, which, both, increase, human, exposure, to, wildlife, deforestation, has, been, coupled, with, an, increase, in, the, occurrence, of, disease, outbreaks, in, malaysia, thousands, of, acres, of, forest, have, been, cleared, for, pig, farms, this, has, resulted, in, an, increase, in, the, spread, of, the, nipah, virus, in, kenya, deforestation, has, led, to, an, increase, in, malaria, cases, which, is, now, the, leading, cause, of, morbidity, and, mortality, the, country, a, 2017, study, found, that, deforestation, substantially, increased, the, incidence, of, malaria, in, nigeria, another, pathway, through, which, deforestation, affects, disease, is, the, relocation, and, dispersion, of, disease, carrying, hosts, this, disease, emergence, pathway, can, be, called, range, expansion, whereby, the, host, s, range, and, thereby, the, range, of, pathogens, expands, to, new, geographic, areas, through, deforestation, hosts, and, reservoir, species, are, forced, into, neighboring, habitats, accompanying, the, reservoir, species, are, pathogens, that, have, the, ability, to, find, new, hosts, in, previously, unexposed, regions, as, these, pathogens, and, species, come, into, closer, contact, with, humans, they, are, infected, both, directly, and, indirectly, another, example, of, range, expansion, due, to, deforestation, and, other, anthropogenic, habitat, impacts, includes, the, capybara, rodent, in, paraguay, according, to, the, world, economic, forum, 31, of, emerging, diseases, are, linked, to, deforestation, a, publication, by, the, united, nations, environment, programme, in, 2016, found, that, deforestation, climate, change, and, livestock, agriculture, are, among, the, main, causes, that, increase, the, risk, of, zoonotic, diseases, that, is, diseases, that, pass, from, animals, to, humans, scientists, have, linked, the, coronavirus, pandemic, to, the, destruction, of, nature, especially, to, deforestation, habitat, loss, in, general, and, wildlife, trade, according, to, the, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, the, coronavirus, disease, 2019, is, zoonotic, e, g, the, virus, passed, from, animals, to, humans, unep, concludes, that, the, most, fundamental, way, to, protect, ourselves, from, zoonotic, diseases, is, to, prevent, destruction, of, nature, where, ecosystems, are, healthy, and, biodiverse, they, are, resilient, adaptable, and, help, to, regulate, diseases, economic, losses, due, to, deforestation, in, brazil, could, reach, around, 317, billion, dollars, per, year, approximately, 7, times, higher, in, comparison, to, the, cost, of, all, commodities, produced, through, deforestation, the, forest, products, industry, is, a, large, part, of, the, economy, in, both, developed, and, developing, countries, short, term, economic, gains, made, by, conversion, of, forest, to, agriculture, or, over, exploitation, of, wood, products, typically, leads, to, a, loss, of, long, term, income, and, long, term, biological, productivity, west, africa, madagascar, southeast, asia, and, many, other, regions, have, experienced, lower, revenue, because, of, declining, timber, harvests, illegal, logging, causes, billions, of, dollars, of, losses, to, national, economies, annually, the, resilience, of, human, food, systems, and, their, capacity, to, adapt, to, future, change, is, linked, to, biodiversity, including, dryland, adapted, shrub, and, tree, species, that, help, combat, desertification, forest, dwelling, insects, bats, and, bird, species, that, pollinate, crops, trees, with, extensive, root, systems, in, mountain, ecosystems, that, prevent, soil, erosion, and, mangrove, species, that, provide, resilience, against, flooding, in, coastal, areas, with, climate, change, exacerbating, the, risks, to, food, systems, the, role, of, forests, in, capturing, and, storing, carbon, and, mitigating, climate, change, is, important, for, the, agricultural, sector, there, are, multiple, methods, that, are, appropriate, and, reliable, for, reducing, and, monitoring, deforestation, one, method, is, the, visual, interpretation, of, aerial, photos, or, satellite, imagery, that, is, labor, intensive, but, does, not, require, high, level, training, in, computer, image, processing, or, extensive, computational, resources, another, method, includes, hot, spot, analysis, that, is, locations, of, rapid, change, using, expert, opinion, or, coarse, resolution, satellite, data, to, identify, locations, for, detailed, digital, analysis, with, high, resolution, satellite, images, deforestation, is, typically, assessed, by, quantifying, the, amount, of, area, deforested, measured, at, the, present, time, from, an, environmental, point, of, view, quantifying, the, damage, and, its, possible, consequences, is, a, more, important, task, while, conservation, efforts, are, more, focused, on, forested, land, protection, and, development, of, land, use, alternatives, to, avoid, continued, deforestation, deforestation, rate, and, total, area, deforested, have, been, widely, used, for, monitoring, deforestation, in, many, regions, including, the, brazilian, amazon, deforestation, monitoring, by, inpe, a, global, satellite, view, is, available, an, example, of, land, change, science, monitoring, of, land, cover, over, time, satellite, imaging, has, become, crucial, in, obtaining, data, on, levels, of, deforestation, and, reforestation, landsat, satellite, data, for, example, has, been, used, to, map, tropical, deforestation, as, part, of, nasa, s, landsat, pathfinder, humid, tropical, deforestation, project, the, project, yielded, deforestation, maps, for, the, amazon, basin, central, africa, and, southeast, asia, for, three, periods, in, the, 1970s, 1980s, and, 1990s, greenpeace, has, mapped, out, the, forests, that, are, still, intact, and, published, this, information, on, the, internet, world, resources, institute, in, turn, has, made, a, simpler, thematic, map, showing, the, amount, of, forests, present, just, before, the, age, of, man, 8000, years, ago, and, the, current, reduced, levels, of, forest, policies, for, forest, protection, include, information, and, education, programs, economic, measures, to, increase, revenue, returns, from, authorized, activities, and, measures, to, increase, effectiveness, of, forest, technicians, and, forest, managers, poverty, and, agricultural, rent, were, found, to, be, principal, factors, leading, to, deforestation, contemporary, domestic, and, foreign, political, decision, makers, could, possibly, create, and, implement, policies, whose, outcomes, ensure, that, economic, activities, in, critical, forests, are, consistent, with, their, scientifically, ascribed, value, for, ecosystem, services, climate, change, mitigation, and, other, purposes, such, policies, may, use, and, organize, the, development, of, complementary, technical, and, economic, means, including, for, lower, levels, of, beef, production, sales, and, consumption, which, would, also, have, major, benefits, for, climate, change, mitigation, higher, levels, of, specified, other, economic, activities, in, such, areas, such, as, reforestation, forest, protection, sustainable, agriculture, for, specific, classes, of, food, products, and, quaternary, work, in, general, product, information, requirements, practice, and, product, certifications, and, eco, tariffs, along, with, the, required, monitoring, and, traceability, inducing, the, creation, and, enforcement, of, such, policies, could, for, instance, achieve, a, global, phase, out, of, deforestation, associated, beef, with, complex, polycentric, governance, measures, goals, like, sufficient, climate, change, mitigation, as, decided, with, e, g, the, paris, agreement, and, a, stoppage, of, deforestation, by, 2030, as, decided, at, the, 2021, united, nations, climate, change, conference, could, be, achieved, a, study, has, suggested, higher, income, nations, need, to, reduce, imports, of, tropical, forest, related, products, and, help, with, theoretically, forest, related, socioeconomic, development, proactive, government, policies, and, international, forest, policies, revisit, and, redesign, global, forest, trade, are, needed, as, well, in, 2022, the, european, parliament, approved, a, bill, aiming, to, stop, the, import, linked, with, deforestation, this, eu, regulation, on, deforestation, free, products, eudr, may, cause, to, brazil, for, example, to, stop, deforestation, for, agricultural, production, and, begun, to, increase, productivity, on, existing, agricultural, land, the, legislation, was, adopted, with, some, changes, by, the, european, council, in, may, 2023, and, is, expected, to, enter, into, force, several, weeks, after, the, bill, requires, companies, who, want, to, import, certain, types, of, products, to, the, european, union, to, prove, the, production, of, those, commodities, is, not, linked, to, areas, deforested, after, 31, of, december, 2020, it, prohibits, also, import, of, products, linked, with, human, rights, abuse, the, list, of, products, includes, palm, oil, cattle, wood, coffee, cocoa, rubber, and, soy, some, derivatives, of, those, products, are, also, included, chocolate, furniture, printed, paper, and, several, palm, oil, based, derivates, but, unfortunately, as, the, report, bankrolling, ecosystem, destruction, shows, this, regulation, of, product, imports, is, not, enough, the, european, financial, sector, is, investing, billions, of, euros, in, the, destruction, of, nature, banks, do, not, respond, positively, to, requests, to, stop, this, which, is, why, the, report, calls, for, european, regulation, in, this, area, to, be, tightened, and, for, banks, to, be, banned, from, continuing, to, finance, deforestation, in, 2014, about, 40, countries, signed, the, new, york, declaration, on, forests, a, voluntary, pledge, to, halve, deforestation, by, 2020, and, end, it, by, 2030, the, agreement, was, not, legally, binding, however, and, some, key, countries, such, as, brazil, china, and, russia, did, not, sign, onto, it, as, a, result, the, effort, failed, and, deforestation, increased, from, 2014, to, 2020, in, november, 2021, 141, countries, with, around, 85, of, the, world, s, primary, tropical, forests, and, 90, of, global, tree, cover, agreed, at, the, cop26, climate, summit, in, glasgow, to, the, glasgow, leaders, declaration, on, forests, and, land, use, a, pledge, to, end, and, reverse, deforestation, by, 2030, the, agreement, was, accompanied, by, about, 19, 2, billion, in, associated, funding, commitments, the, 2021, glasgow, agreement, improved, on, the, new, york, declaration, by, now, including, brazil, and, many, other, countries, that, did, not, sign, the, 2014, agreement, some, key, nations, with, high, rates, of, deforestation, including, malaysia, cambodia, laos, paraguay, and, myanmar, have, not, signed, the, glasgow, declaration, like, the, earlier, agreement, the, glasgow, leaders, declaration, was, entered, into, outside, the, un, framework, convention, on, climate, change, and, is, thus, not, legally, binding, in, november, 2021, the, eu, executive, outlined, a, draft, law, requiring, companies, to, prove, that, the, agricultural, commodities, beef, wood, palm, oil, soy, coffee, and, cocoa, destined, for, the, eu, s, 450, million, consumers, were, not, linked, to, deforestation, in, september, 2022, the, eu, parliament, supported, and, strengthened, the, plan, from, the, eu, s, executive, with, 453, votes, to, 57, in, 2018, the, biggest, palm, oil, trader, wilmar, decided, to, control, its, suppliers, to, avoid, deforestation, in, 2021, over, 100, world, leaders, representing, countries, containing, more, than, 85, of, the, world, s, forests, committed, to, halt, and, reverse, deforestation, and, land, degradation, by, 2030, indigenous, communities, have, long, been, the, frontline, of, resistance, against, deforestation, transferring, rights, over, land, from, public, domain, to, its, indigenous, inhabitants, is, argued, to, be, a, cost, effective, strategy, to, conserve, forests, this, includes, the, protection, of, such, rights, entitled, in, existing, laws, such, as, india, s, forest, rights, act, the, transferring, of, such, rights, in, china, perhaps, the, largest, land, reform, in, modern, times, has, been, argued, to, have, increased, forest, cover, in, brazil, forested, areas, given, tenure, to, indigenous, groups, have, even, lower, rates, of, clearing, than, national, parks, community, concessions, in, the, congolian, rainforests, have, significantly, less, deforestation, as, communities, are, incentivized, to, manage, the, land, sustainably, even, reducing, poverty, in, areas, where, slash, and, burn, is, practiced, switching, to, slash, and, char, would, prevent, the, rapid, deforestation, and, subsequent, degradation, of, soils, the, biochar, thus, created, given, back, to, the, soil, is, not, only, a, durable, carbon, sequestration, method, but, it, also, is, an, extremely, beneficial, amendment, to, the, soil, mixed, with, biomass, it, brings, the, creation, of, terra, preta, one, of, the, richest, soils, on, the, planet, and, the, only, one, known, to, regenerate, itself, certification, as, provided, by, global, certification, systems, such, as, programme, for, the, endorsement, of, forest, certification, and, forest, stewardship, council, contributes, to, tackling, deforestation, by, creating, market, demand, for, timber, from, sustainably, managed, forests, according, to, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, a, major, condition, for, the, adoption, of, sustainable, forest, management, is, a, demand, for, products, that, are, produced, sustainably, and, consumer, willingness, to, pay, for, the, higher, costs, entailed, by, promoting, the, positive, attributes, of, forest, products, from, sustainably, managed, forests, certification, focuses, on, the, demand, side, of, environmental, conservation, reducing, emissions, from, deforestation, and, forest, degradation, redd, in, developing, countries, has, emerged, as, a, new, potential, to, complement, ongoing, climate, policies, the, idea, consists, in, providing, financial, compensations, for, the, reduction, of, greenhouse, gas, ghg, emissions, from, deforestation, and, forest, degradation, redd, can, be, seen, as, an, alternative, to, the, emissions, trading, system, as, in, the, latter, polluters, must, pay, for, permits, for, the, right, to, emit, certain, pollutants, i, e, co, 2, main, international, organizations, including, the, united, nations, and, the, world, bank, have, begun, to, develop, programs, aimed, at, curbing, deforestation, the, blanket, term, reducing, emissions, from,

2009, an, accord, was, reached, with, a, collective, commitment, by, developed, countries, for, new, and, additional, resources, including, forestry, and, investments, through, international,

rainforest, collapse, was, an, event, that, occurred, 300, million, years, ago, climate, change, devastated, tropical, rainforests, causing, the, extinction, of, many, plant, and, animal, species, the, change, was, abrupt, specifically, at, this, time, climate, became, cooler, and, drier, conditions, that, are, not, favorable, to, the, growth, of, rainforests, and, much, of, the, biodiversity, within, them, rainforests, were, fragmented, forming, shrinking, islands, further, and, further, apart, populations, such, as, the, sub, class, lissamphibia, were, devastated, whereas, reptilia, survived, the, collapse, the, surviving, organisms, were, better, adapted, to, the, drier, environment, left, behind, and, served, as, legacies, in, succession, after, the, collapse, rainforests, once, covered, 14, of, the, earth, s, land, surface, now, they, cover, a, mere, 6, and, experts, estimate, that, the, last, remaining, rainforests, could, be, consumed, in, less, than, 40, years, small, scale, deforestation, was, practiced, by, some, societies, for, tens, of, thousands, of, years, before, the, beginnings, of, civilization, the, first, evidence, of, deforestation, appears, in, the, mesolithic, period, it, was, probably, used, to, convert, closed, forests, into, more, open, ecosystems, favourable, to, game, animals, with, the, advent, of, agriculture, larger, areas, began, to, be, deforested, and, fire, became, the, prime, tool, to, clear, land, for, crops, in, europe, there, is, little, solid, evidence, before, 7000, bc, mesolithic, foragers, used, fire, to, create, openings, for, red, deer, and, wild, boar, in, great, britain, shade, tolerant, species, such, as, oak, and, ash, are, replaced, in, the, pollen, record, by, hazels, brambles, grasses, and, nettles, removal, of, the, forests, led, to, decreased, transpiration, resulting, in, the, formation, of, upland, peat, bogs, widespread, decrease, in, elm, pollen, across, europe, between, 8400, and, 8300, bc, and, 7200, 7000, bc, starting, in, southern, europe, and, gradually, moving, north, to, great, britain, may, represent, land, clearing, by, fire, at, the, onset, of, neolithic, agriculture, the, neolithic, period, saw, extensive, deforestation, for, farming, land, stone, axes, were, being, made, from, about, 3000, bc, not, just, from, flint, but, from, a, wide, variety, of, hard, rocks, from, across, britain, and, north, america, as, well, they, include, the, noted, langdale, axe, industry, in, the, english, lake, district, quarries, developed, at, penmaenmawr, in, north, wales, and, numerous, other, locations, rough, outs, were, made, locally, near, the, quarries, and, some, were, polished, locally, to, give, a, fine, finish, this, step, not, only, increased, the, mechanical, strength, of, the, axe, but, also, made, penetration, of, wood, easier, flint, was, still, used, from, sources, such, as, grimes, graves, but, from, many, other, mines, across, europe, evidence, of, deforestation, has, been, found, in, minoan, crete, for, example, the, environs, of, the, palace, of, knossos, were, severely, deforested, in, the, bronze, age, just, as, archaeologists, have, shown, that, prehistoric, farming, societies, had, to, cut, or, burn, forests, before, planting, documents, and, artifacts, from, early, civilizations, often, reveal, histories, of, deforestation, some, of, the, most, dramatic, are, eighth, century, bce, assyrian, reliefs, depicting, logs, being, floated, downstream, from, conquered, areas, to, the, less, forested, capital, region, as, spoils, of, war, ancient, chinese, texts, make, clear, that, some, areas, of, the, yellow, river, valley, had, already, destroyed, many, of, their, forests, over, 2000, years, ago, and, had, to, plant, trees, as, crops, or, import, them, from, long, distances, in, south, china, much, of, the, land, came, to, be, privately, owned, and, used, for, the, commercial, growing, of, timber, three, regional, studies, of, historic, erosion, and, alluviation, in, ancient, greece, found, that, wherever, adequate, evidence, exists, a, major, phase, of, erosion, follows, the, introduction, of, farming, in, the, various, regions, of, greece, by, about, 500, 1, 000, years, ranging, from, the, later, neolithic, to, the, early, bronze, age, the, thousand, years, following, the, mid, first, millennium, bc, saw, serious, intermittent, pulses, of, soil, erosion, in, numerous, places, the, historic, silting, of, ports, along, the, southern, coasts, of, asia, minor, e, g, clarus, and, the, examples, of, ephesus, priene, and, miletus, where, harbors, had, to, be, abandoned, because, of, the, silt, deposited, by, the, meander, and, in, coastal, syria, during, the, last, centuries, bc, easter, island, has, suffered, from, heavy, soil, erosion, in, recent, centuries, aggravated, by, agriculture, and, deforestation, the, disappearance, of, the, island, s, trees, seems, to, coincide, with, a, decline, of, its, civilization, around, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, scholars, have, attributed, the, collapse, to, deforestation, and, over, exploitation, of, all, resources, the, famous, silting, up, of, the, harbor, for, bruges, which, moved, port, commerce, to, antwerp, also, followed, a, period, of, increased, settlement, growth, and, apparently, of, deforestation, in, the, upper, river, basins, in, early, medieval, riez, in, upper, provence, alluvial, silt, from, two, small, rivers, raised, the, riverbeds, and, widened, the, floodplain, which, slowly, buried, the, roman, settlement, in, alluvium, and, gradually, moved, new, construction, to, higher, ground, concurrently, the, headwater, valleys, above, riez, were, being, opened, to, pasturage, a, typical, progress, trap, was, that, cities, were, often, built, in, a, forested, area, which, would, provide, wood, for, some, industry, for, example, construction, shipbuilding, pottery, when, deforestation, occurs, without, proper, replanting, however, local, wood, supplies, become, difficult, to, obtain, near, enough, to, remain, competitive, leading, to, the, city, s, abandonment, as, happened, repeatedly, in, ancient, asia, minor, because, of, fuel, needs, mining, and, metallurgy, often, led, to, deforestation, and, city, abandonment, with, most, of, the, population, remaining, active, in, or, indirectly, dependent, on, the, agricultural, sector, the, main, pressure, in, most, areas, remained, land, clearing, for, crop, and, cattle, farming, enough, wild, green, was, usually, left, standing, and, partially, used, for, example, to, collect, firewood, timber, and, fruits, or, to, graze, pigs, for, wildlife, to, remain, viable, the, elite, s, nobility, and, higher, clergy, protection, of, their, own, hunting, privileges, and, game, often, protected, significant, woodland, major, parts, in, the, spread, and, thus, more, durable, growth, of, the, population, were, played, by, monastical, pioneering, especially, by, the, benedictine, and, commercial, orders, and, some, feudal, lords, recruiting, farmers, to, settle, and, become, tax, payers, by, offering, relatively, good, legal, and, fiscal, conditions, even, when, speculators, sought, to, encourage, towns, settlers, needed, an, agricultural, belt, around, or, sometimes, within, defensive, walls, when, populations, were, quickly, decreased, by, causes, such, as, the, black, death, the, colonization, of, the, americas, or, devastating, warfare, for, example, genghis, khan, s, mongol, hordes, in, eastern, and, central, europe, thirty, years, war, in, germany, this, could, lead, to, settlements, being, abandoned, the, land, was, reclaimed, by, nature, but, the, secondary, forests, usually, lacked, the, original, biodiversity, the, mongol, invasions, and, conquests, alone, resulted, in, the, reduction, of, 700, million, tons, of, carbon, from, the, atmosphere, by, enabling, the, re, growth, of, carbon, absorbing, forests, on, depopulated, lands, over, a, significant, period, of, time, from, 1100, to, 1500, ad, significant, deforestation, took, place, in, western, europe, as, a, result, of, the, expanding, human, population, the, large, scale, building, of, wooden, sailing, ships, by, european, coastal, naval, owners, since, the, 15th, century, for, exploration, colonisation, slave, trade, and, other, trade, on, the, high, seas, consumed, many, forest, resources, and, became, responsible, for, the, introduction, of, numerous, bubonic, plague, outbreaks, in, the, 14th, century, piracy, also, contributed, to, the, over, harvesting, of, forests, as, in, spain, this, led, to, a, weakening, of, the, domestic, economy, after, columbus, discovery, of, america, as, the, economy, became, dependent, on, colonial, activities, plundering, mining, cattle, plantations, trade, etc, the, massive, use, of, charcoal, on, an, industrial, scale, in, early, modern, europe, was, a, new, type, of, consumption, of, western, forests, each, of, nelson, s, royal, navy, war, ships, at, trafalgar, 1805, required, 6, 000, mature, oaks, for, its, construction, in, france, colbert, planted, oak, forests, to, supply, the, french, navy, in, the, future, when, the, oak, plantations, matured, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, masts, were, no, longer, required, because, shipping, had, changed, efforts, to, stop, or, slow, deforestation, have, been, attempted, for, many, centuries, because, it, has, long, been, known, that, deforestation, can, cause, environmental, damage, sufficient, in, some, cases, to, cause, societies, to, collapse, in, tonga, paramount, rulers, developed, policies, designed, to, prevent, conflicts, between, short, term, gains, from, converting, forest, to, farmland, and, long, term, problems, forest, loss, would, cause, while, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, tokugawa, japan, the, sh, guns, developed, a, highly, sophisticated, system, of, long, term, planning, to, stop, and, even, reverse, deforestation, of, the, preceding, centuries, through, substituting, timber, by, other, products, and, more, efficient, use, of, land, that, had, been, farmed, for, many, centuries, in, 16th, century, germany, landowners, also, developed, silviculture, to, deal, with, the, problem, of, deforestation, however, these, policies, tend, to, be, limited, to, environments, with, good, rainfall, no, dry, season, and, very, young, soils, through, volcanism, or, glaciation, this, is, because, on, older, and, less, fertile, soils, trees, grow, too, slowly, for, silviculture, to, be, economic, whilst, in, areas, with, a, strong, dry, season, there, is, always, a, risk, of, forest, fires, destroying, a, tree, crop, before, it, matures, in, the, 19th, century, introduction, of, steamboats, in, the, united, states, was, the, cause, of, deforestation, of, banks, of, major, rivers, such, as, the, mississippi, river, with, increased, and, more, severe, flooding, one, of, the, environmental, results, the, steamboat, crews, cut, wood, every, day, from, the, riverbanks, to, fuel, the, steam, engines, between, st, louis, and, the, confluence, with, the, ohio, river, to, the, south, the, mississippi, became, more, wide, and, shallow, and, changed, its, channel, laterally, attempts, to, improve, navigation, by, the, use, of, snag, pullers, often, resulted, in, crews, clearing, large, trees, 100, to, 200, feet, 61, m, back, from, the, banks, several, french, colonial, towns, of, the, illinois, country, such, as, kaskaskia, cahokia, and, st, philippe, illinois, were, flooded, and, abandoned, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, a, loss, to, the, cultural, record, of, their, archeology, different, cultures, of, different,
