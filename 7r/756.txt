suffering, or, pain, in, a, broad, sense, may, be, an, experience, of, unpleasantness, or, aversion, possibly, associated, with, the, perception, of, harm, or, threat, of, harm, in, an, individual, suffering, is, the, basic, element, that, makes, up, the, negative, valence, of, affective, phenomena, the, opposite, of, suffering, is, pleasure, or, happiness, suffering, is, often, categorized, as, physical, or, mental, it, may, come, in, all, degrees, of, intensity, from, mild, to, intolerable, factors, of, duration, and, frequency, of, occurrence, usually, compound, that, of, intensity, attitudes, toward, suffering, may, vary, widely, in, the, sufferer, or, other, people, according, to, how, much, it, is, regarded, as, avoidable, or, unavoidable, useful, or, useless, deserved, or, undeserved, suffering, occurs, in, the, lives, of, sentient, beings, in, numerous, manners, often, dramatically, as, a, result, many, fields, of, human, activity, are, concerned, with, some, aspects, of, suffering, these, aspects, may, include, the, nature, of, suffering, its, processes, its, origin, and, causes, its, meaning, and, significance, its, related, personal, social, and, cultural, behaviors, its, remedies, management, and, uses, the, word, suffering, is, sometimes, used, in, the, narrow, sense, of, physical, pain, but, more, often, it, refers, to, psychological, pain, or, more, often, yet, it, refers, to, pain, in, the, broad, sense, i, e, to, any, unpleasant, feeling, emotion, or, sensation, the, word, pain, usually, refers, to, physical, pain, but, it, is, also, a, common, synonym, of, suffering, the, words, pain, and, suffering, are, often, used, both, together, in, different, ways, for, instance, they, may, be, used, as, interchangeable, synonyms, or, they, may, be, used, in, contradistinction, to, one, another, as, in, pain, is, physical, suffering, is, mental, or, pain, is, inevitable, suffering, is, optional, or, they, may, be, used, to, define, each, other, as, in, pain, is, physical, suffering, or, suffering, is, severe, physical, or, mental, pain, qualifiers, such, as, physical, mental, emotional, and, psychological, are, often, used, to, refer, to, certain, types, of, pain, or, suffering, in, particular, mental, pain, or, suffering, may, be, used, in, relationship, with, physical, pain, or, suffering, for, distinguishing, between, two, wide, categories, of, pain, or, suffering, a, first, caveat, concerning, such, a, distinction, is, that, it, uses, physical, pain, in, a, sense, that, normally, includes, not, only, the, typical, sensory, experience, of, physical, pain, but, also, other, unpleasant, bodily, experiences, including, air, hunger, hunger, vestibular, suffering, nausea, sleep, deprivation, and, itching, a, second, caveat, is, that, the, terms, physical, or, mental, should, not, be, taken, too, literally, physical, pain, or, suffering, as, a, matter, of, fact, happens, through, conscious, minds, and, involves, emotional, aspects, while, mental, pain, or, suffering, happens, through, physical, brains, and, being, an, emotion, involves, important, physiological, aspects, the, word, unpleasantness, which, some, people, use, as, a, synonym, of, suffering, or, pain, in, the, broad, sense, may, refer, to, the, basic, affective, dimension, of, pain, its, suffering, aspect, usually, in, contrast, with, the, sensory, dimension, as, for, instance, in, this, sentence, pain, unpleasantness, is, often, though, not, always, closely, linked, to, both, the, intensity, and, unique, qualities, of, the, painful, sensation, other, current, words, that, have, a, definition, with, some, similarity, to, suffering, include, distress, unhappiness, misery, affliction, woe, ill, discomfort, displeasure, disagreeableness, many, of, the, hellenistic, philosophies, addressed, suffering, in, cynicism, suffering, is, alleviated, by, achieving, mental, clarity, or, lucidity, atyphia, developing, self, sufficiency, autarky, equanimity, arete, love, of, humanity, parrhesia, and, indifference, to, the, vicissitudes, of, life, adiaphora, for, pyrrhonism, suffering, comes, from, dogmas, i, e, beliefs, regarding, non, evident, matters, most, particularly, beliefs, that, certain, things, are, either, good, or, bad, by, nature, suffering, can, be, removed, by, developing, epoche, suspension, of, judgment, regarding, beliefs, which, leads, to, ataraxia, mental, tranquility, epicurus, contrary, to, common, misperceptions, of, his, doctrine, advocated, that, we, should, first, seek, to, avoid, suffering, aponia, and, that, the, greatest, pleasure, lies, in, ataraxia, free, from, the, worrisome, pursuit, or, the, unwelcome, consequences, of, ephemeral, pleasures, epicureanism, s, version, of, hedonism, as, an, ethical, theory, claims, that, good, and, bad, consist, ultimately, in, pleasure, and, pain, for, stoicism, the, greatest, good, lies, in, reason, and, virtue, but, the, soul, best, reaches, it, through, a, kind, of, indifference, apatheia, to, pleasure, and, pain, as, a, consequence, this, doctrine, has, become, identified, with, stern, self, control, in, regard, to, suffering, jeremy, bentham, developed, hedonistic, utilitarianism, a, popular, doctrine, in, ethics, politics, and, economics, bentham, argued, that, the, right, act, or, policy, was, that, which, would, cause, the, greatest, happiness, of, the, greatest, number, he, suggested, a, procedure, called, hedonic, or, felicific, calculus, for, determining, how, much, pleasure, and, pain, would, result, from, any, action, john, stuart, mill, improved, and, promoted, the, doctrine, of, hedonistic, utilitarianism, karl, popper, in, the, open, society, and, its, enemies, proposed, a, negative, utilitarianism, which, prioritizes, the, reduction, of, suffering, over, the, enhancement, of, happiness, when, speaking, of, utility, i, believe, that, there, is, from, the, ethical, point, of, view, no, symmetry, between, suffering, and, happiness, or, between, pain, and, pleasure, human, suffering, makes, a, direct, moral, appeal, for, help, while, there, is, no, similar, call, to, increase, the, happiness, of, a, man, who, is, doing, well, anyway, david, pearce, for, his, part, advocates, a, utilitarianism, that, aims, straightforwardly, at, the, abolition, of, suffering, through, the, use, of, biotechnology, see, more, details, below, in, section, biology, neurology, psychology, another, aspect, worthy, of, mention, here, is, that, many, utilitarians, since, bentham, hold, that, the, moral, status, of, a, being, comes, from, its, ability, to, feel, pleasure, and, pain, therefore, moral, agents, should, consider, not, only, the, interests, of, human, beings, but, also, those, of, other, animals, richard, ryder, came, to, the, same, conclusion, in, his, concepts, of, speciesism, and, painism, peter, singer, s, writings, especially, the, book, animal, liberation, represent, the, leading, edge, of, this, kind, of, utilitarianism, for, animals, as, well, as, for, people, another, doctrine, related, to, the, relief, of, suffering, is, humanitarianism, see, also, humanitarian, principles, humanitarian, aid, and, humane, society, where, humanitarian, efforts, seek, a, positive, addition, to, the, happiness, of, sentient, beings, it, is, to, make, the, unhappy, happy, rather, than, the, happy, happier, is, an, ingredient, in, many, social, attitudes, in, the, modern, world, it, has, so, penetrated, into, diverse, movements, that, it, can, hardly, be, said, to, exist, in, itself, pessimists, hold, this, world, to, be, mainly, bad, or, even, the, worst, possible, plagued, with, among, other, things, unbearable, and, unstoppable, suffering, some, identify, suffering, as, the, nature, of, the, world, and, conclude, that, it, would, be, better, if, life, did, not, exist, at, all, arthur, schopenhauer, recommends, us, to, take, refuge, in, things, like, art, philosophy, loss, of, the, will, to, live, and, tolerance, toward, fellow, sufferers, friedrich, nietzsche, first, influenced, by, schopenhauer, developed, afterward, quite, another, attitude, arguing, that, the, suffering, of, life, is, productive, exalting, the, will, to, power, despising, weak, compassion, or, pity, and, recommending, us, to, embrace, willfully, the, eternal, return, of, the, greatest, sufferings, philosophy, of, pain, is, a, philosophical, speciality, that, focuses, on, physical, pain, and, is, through, that, relevant, to, suffering, in, general, suffering, plays, an, important, role, in, a, number, of, religions, regarding, matters, such, as, the, following, consolation, or, relief, moral, conduct, do, no, harm, help, the, afflicted, show, compassion, spiritual, advancement, through, life, hardships, or, through, self, imposed, trials, mortification, of, the, flesh, penance, asceticism, ultimate, destiny, salvation, damnation, hell, theodicy, deals, with, the, problem, of, evil, which, is, the, difficulty, of, reconciling, the, existence, of, an, omnipotent, and, benevolent, god, with, the, existence, of, evil, a, quintessential, form, of, evil, for, many, people, is, extreme, suffering, especially, in, innocent, children, or, in, creatures, destined, to, an, eternity, of, torments, see, problem, of, hell, the, four, noble, truths, of, buddhism, are, about, dukkha, a, term, often, translated, as, suffering, they, state, the, nature, of, suffering, its, cause, its, cessation, and, the, way, leading, to, its, cessation, the, noble, eightfold, path, buddhism, considers, liberation, from, dukkha, and, the, practice, of, compassion, karuna, as, basic, for, leading, a, holy, life, and, attaining, nirvana, hinduism, holds, that, suffering, follows, naturally, from, personal, negative, behaviors, in, one, s, current, life, or, in, a, past, life, see, karma, in, hinduism, one, must, accept, suffering, as, a, just, consequence, and, as, an, opportunity, for, spiritual, progress, thus, the, soul, or, true, self, which, is, eternally, free, of, any, suffering, may, come, to, manifest, itself, in, the, person, who, then, achieves, liberation, moksha, abstinence, from, causing, pain, or, harm, to, other, beings, called, ahimsa, is, a, central, tenet, of, hinduism, and, even, more, so, of, another, indian, religion, jainism, see, ahimsa, in, jainism, in, judaism, suffering, is, often, seen, as, a, punishment, for, sins, and, a, test, of, a, person, s, faith, like, the, book, of, job, illustrates, for, christianity, redemptive, suffering, is, the, belief, that, human, suffering, when, accepted, and, offered, up, in, union, with, the, passion, flogging, and, crucifixion, of, jesus, can, remit, the, just, punishment, for, sins, and, allow, oneself, to, grow, in, the, love, of, the, trinity, other, people, and, oneself, in, islam, the, faithful, must, endure, suffering, with, hope, and, faith, not, resist, or, ask, why, accept, it, as, allah, s, will, and, submit, to, it, as, a, test, of, faith, allah, never, asks, more, than, can, be, endured, one, must, also, work, to, alleviate, the, suffering, of, others, as, well, as, one, s, own, suffering, is, also, seen, as, a, blessing, through, that, gift, the, sufferer, remembers, allah, and, connects, with, him, suffering, expunges, the, sins, of, human, beings, and, cleanses, their, soul, for, the, immense, reward, of, the, afterlife, and, the, avoidance, of, hell, according, to, the, bah, faith, all, suffering, is, a, brief, and, temporary, manifestation, of, physical, life, whose, source, is, the, material, aspects, of, physical, existence, and, often, attachment, to, them, whereas, only, joy, exists, in, the, spiritual, worlds, artistic, and, literary, works, often, engage, with, suffering, sometimes, at, great, cost, to, their, creators, or, performers, be, it, in, the, tragic, comic, or, other, genres, art, and, literature, offer, means, to, alleviate, and, perhaps, also, exacerbate, suffering, as, argued, for, instance, in, harold, schweizer, s, suffering, and, the, remedy, of, art, this, bruegel, painting, is, among, those, that, inspired, w, h, auden, s, poem, mus, e, des, beaux, arts, about, suffering, they, were, never, wrong, the, old, masters, how, well, they, understood, its, human, position, how, it, takes, place, while, someone, else, is, eating, or, opening, a, window, or, just, walking, dully, along, in, breughel, s, icarus, for, instance, how, everything, turns, away, quite, leisurely, from, the, disaster, social, suffering, according, to, arthur, kleinman, and, others, describes, collective, and, individual, human, suffering, associated, with, life, conditions, shaped, by, powerful, social, forces, such, suffering, is, an, increasing, concern, in, medical, anthropology, ethnography, mass, media, analysis, and, holocaust, studies, says, iain, wilkinson, who, is, developing, a, sociology, of, suffering, the, encyclopedia, of, world, problems, and, human, potential, is, a, work, by, the, union, of, international, associations, its, main, databases, are, about, world, problems, 56, 564, profiles, global, strategies, and, solutions, 32, 547, profiles, human, values, 3, 257, profiles, and, human, development, 4, 817, profiles, it, states, that, the, most, fundamental, entry, common, to, the, core, parts, is, that, of, pain, or, suffering, and, common, to, the, core, parts, is, the, learning, dimension, of, new, understanding, or, insight, in, response, to, suffering, ralph, siu, an, american, author, urged, in, 1988, the, creation, of, a, new, and, vigorous, academic, discipline, called, panetics, to, be, devoted, to, the, study, of, the, infliction, of, suffering, the, international, society, for, panetics, was, founded, in, 1991, to, study, and, develop, ways, to, reduce, the, infliction, of, human, suffering, by, individuals, acting, through, professions, corporations, governments, and, other, social, groups, in, economics, the, following, notions, relate, not, only, to, the, matters, suggested, by, their, positive, appellations, but, to, the, matter, of, suffering, as, well, well, being, or, quality, of, life, welfare, economics, happiness, economics, gross, national, happiness, genuine, progress, indicator, in, law, pain, and, suffering, is, a, legal, term, that, refers, to, the, mental, distress, or, physical, pain, endured, by, a, plaintiff, as, a, result, of, injury, for, which, the, plaintiff, seeks, redress, assessments, of, pain, and, suffering, are, required, to, be, made, for, attributing, legal, awards, in, the, western, world, these, are, typical, made, by, juries, in, a, discretionary, fashion, and, are, regarded, as, subjective, variable, and, difficult, to, predict, for, instance, in, the, us, uk, australia, and, new, zealand, see, also, in, us, law, negligent, infliction, of, emotional, distress, and, intentional, infliction, of, emotional, distress, in, management, and, organization, studies, drawing, on, the, work, of, eric, cassell, suffering, has, been, defined, as, the, distress, a, person, experiences, when, they, perceive, a, threat, to, any, aspect, of, their, continued, existence, whether, physical, psychological, or, social, other, researchers, have, noted, that, suffering, results, from, an, inability, to, control, actions, that, usually, define, one, s, view, of, one, s, self, and, that, the, characteristics, of, suffering, include, the, loss, of, autonomy, or, the, loss, of, valued, relationships, or, sense, of, self, suffering, is, therefore, determined, not, by, the, threat, itself, but, rather, by, its, meaning, to, the, individual, and, the, threat, to, their, personhood, suffering, and, pleasure, are, respectively, the, negative, and, positive, affects, or, hedonic, tones, or, valences, that, psychologists, often, identify, as, basic, in, our, emotional, lives, the, evolutionary, role, of, physical, and, mental, suffering, through, natural, selection, is, primordial, it, warns, of, threats, motivates, coping, fight, or, flight, escapism, and, reinforces, negatively, certain, behaviors, see, punishment, aversives, despite, its, initial, disrupting, nature, suffering, contributes, to, the, organization, of, meaning, in, an, individual, s, world, and, psyche, in, turn, meaning, determines, how, individuals, or, societies, experience, and, deal, with, suffering, many, brain, structures, and, physiological, processes, are, involved, in, suffering, particularly, the, anterior, insula, and, cingulate, cortex, both, implicated, in, nociceptive, and, empathic, pain, various, hypotheses, try, to, account, for, the, experience, of, suffering, one, of, these, the, pain, overlap, theory, takes, note, thanks, to, neuroimaging, studies, that, the, cingulate, cortex, fires, up, when, the, brain, feels, suffering, from, experimentally, induced, social, distress, as, well, as, physical, pain, the, theory, proposes, therefore, that, physical, pain, and, social, pain, i, e, two, radically, differing, kinds, of, suffering, share, a, common, phenomenological, and, neurological, basis, according, to, david, pearce, s, online, manifesto, the, hedonistic, imperative, suffering, is, the, avoidable, result, of, darwinian, evolution, pearce, promotes, replacing, the, biology, of, suffering, with, a, robot, like, response, to, noxious, stimuli, or, with, information, sensitive, gradients, of, bliss, through, genetic, engineering, and, other, technical, scientific, advances, different, theories, of, psychology, view, suffering, differently, sigmund, freud, viewed, suffering, as, something, humans, are, hardwired, to, avoid, while, they, are, always, in, the, pursuit, of, pleasure, also, known, as, the, hedonic, theory, of, motivation, or, the, pleasure, principle, this, dogma, also, ties, in, with, certain, concepts, of, behaviorism, most, notably, operant, conditioning, theory, in, operant, conditioning, a, negative, stimulus, is, removed, thereby, increasing, a, desired, behavior, alternatively, an, aversive, stimulus, can, be, introduced, as, a, punishing, factor, in, both, methods, unfavorable, circumstances, are, used, in, order, to, motivate, an, individual, or, an, animal, towards, a, certain, goal, however, other, theories, of, psychology, present, contradicting, ideas, such, as, the, idea, that, humans, sometimes, seek, out, suffering, many, existentialists, believe, suffering, is, necessary, in, order, to, find, meaning, in, our, lives, existential, positive, psychology, is, a, theory, dedicated, to, exploring, the, relationship, between, suffering, and, happiness, and, the, belief, that, true, authentic, happiness, can, only, come, from, experiencing, pain, and, hardships, hedonistic, psychology, affective, science, and, affective, neuroscience, are, some, of, the, emerging, scientific, fields, that, could, in, the, coming, years, focus, their, attention, on, the, phenomenon, of, suffering, disease, and, injury, may, contribute, to, suffering, in, humans, and, animals, for, example, suffering, may, be, a, feature, of, mental, or, physical, illness, such, as, borderline, personality, disorder, and, occasionally, in, advanced, cancer, health, care, addresses, this, suffering, in, many, ways, in, subfields, such, as, medicine, clinical, psychology, psychotherapy, alternative, medicine, hygiene, public, health, and, through, various, health, care, providers, health, care, approaches, to, suffering, however, remain, problematic, physician, and, author, eric, cassell, widely, cited, on, the, subject, of, attending, to, the, suffering, person, as, a, primary, goal, of, medicine, has, defined, suffering, as, the, state, of, severe, distress, associated, with, events, that, threaten, the, intactness, of, the, person, cassell, writes, the, obligation, of, physicians, to, relieve, human, suffering, stretches, back, to, antiquity, despite, this, fact, little, attention, is, explicitly, given, to, the, problem, of, suffering, in, medical, education, research, or, practice, mirroring, the, traditional, body, and, mind, dichotomy, that, underlies, its, teaching, and, practice, medicine, strongly, distinguishes, pain, from, suffering, and, most, attention, goes, to, the, treatment, of, pain, nevertheless, physical, pain, itself, still, lacks, adequate, attention, from, the, medical, community, according, to, numerous, reports, besides, some, medical, fields, like, palliative, care, pain, management, or, pain, medicine, oncology, or, psychiatry, do, somewhat, address, suffering, as, such, in, palliative, care, for, instance, pioneer, cicely, saunders, created, the, concept, of, total, pain, total, suffering, say, now, the, textbooks, which, encompasses, the, whole, set, of, physical, and, mental, distress, discomfort, symptoms, problems, or, needs, that, a, patient, may, experience, hurtfully, gary, greenberg, in, the, book, of, woe, writes, that, mental, illness, might, best, be, viewed, as, medicalization, or, labeling, naming, suffering, i, e, that, all, mental, illnesses, might, not, necessarily, be, of, dysfunction, or, biological, etiology, but, might, be, social, or, cultural, societal, since, suffering, is, such, a, universal, motivating, experience, people, when, asked, can, relate, their, activities, to, its, relief, and, prevention, farmers, for, instance, may, claim, that, they, prevent, famine, artists, may, say, that, they, take, our, minds, off, our, worries, and, teachers, may, hold, that, they, hand, down, tools, for, coping, with, life, hazards, in, certain, aspects, of, collective, life, however, suffering, is, more, readily, an, explicit, concern, by, itself, such, aspects, may, include, public, health, human, rights, humanitarian, aid, disaster, relief, philanthropy, economic, aid, social, services, insurance, and, animal, welfare, to, these, can, be, added, the, aspects, of, security, and, safety, which, relate, to, precautionary, measures, taken, by, individuals, or, families, to, interventions, by, the, military, the, police, the, firefighters, and, to, notions, or, fields, like, social, security, environmental, security, and, human, security, the, nongovernmental, research, organization, center, on, long, term, risk, formerly, known, as, the, foundational, research, institute, focuses, on, reducing, risks, of, astronomical, suffering, s, risks, from, emerging, technologies, another, organization, also, focused, on, research, the, center, on, reducing, suffering, has, a, similar, focus, with, a, stress, on, clarifying, what, priorities, there, should, be, at, a, practical, level, to, attain, the, goal, of, reducing, intense, suffering, in, the, future, philosopher, leonard, katz, wrote, but, nature, as, we, now, know, regards, ultimately, only, fitness, and, not, our, happiness, and, does, not, scruple, to, use, hate, fear, punishment, and, even, war, alongside, affection, in, ordering, social, groups, and, selecting, among, them, just, as, she, uses, pain, as, well, as, pleasure, to, get, us, to, feed, water, and, protect, our, bodies, and, also, in, forging, our, social, bonds, people, make, use, of, suffering, for, specific, social, or, personal, purposes, in, many, areas, of, human, life, as, can, be, seen, in, the, following, instances, isbn, 0, 19, 504996, 9
