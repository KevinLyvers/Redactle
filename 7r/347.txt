an, alphabet, is, a, standard, set, of, letters, written, to, represent, particular, sounds, in, a, spoken, language, specifically, letters, largely, correspond, to, phonemes, as, the, smallest, sound, segments, that, can, distinguish, one, word, from, another, in, a, given, language, not, all, writing, systems, represent, language, in, this, way, a, syllabary, assigns, symbols, to, spoken, syllables, while, logographies, assign, symbols, to, words, morphemes, or, other, semantic, units, the, first, letters, were, invented, in, ancient, egypt, to, serve, as, an, aid, in, writing, egyptian, hieroglyphs, these, are, referred, to, as, egyptian, uniliteral, signs, by, lexicographers, this, system, was, used, until, the, 5th, century, ce, and, fundamentally, differed, by, adding, pronunciation, hints, to, existing, hieroglyphs, that, had, previously, carried, no, pronunciation, information, later, on, these, phonemic, symbols, also, became, used, to, transcribe, foreign, words, the, first, fully, phonemic, script, was, the, proto, sinaitic, script, also, descending, from, egyptian, hieroglyphs, which, was, later, modified, to, create, the, phoenician, alphabet, the, phoenician, system, is, considered, the, first, true, alphabet, and, is, the, ultimate, ancestor, of, many, modern, scripts, including, arabic, cyrillic, greek, hebrew, latin, and, possibly, brahmic, peter, t, daniels, distinguishes, true, alphabets, which, use, letters, to, represent, both, consonants, and, vowels, from, both, abugidas, and, abjads, which, only, need, letters, for, consonants, abjads, generally, lack, vowel, indicators, altogether, while, abugidas, represent, them, with, diacritics, added, to, letters, in, this, narrower, sense, the, greek, alphabet, was, the, first, true, alphabet, it, was, originally, derived, from, the, phoenician, alphabet, which, was, an, abjad, alphabets, usually, have, a, standard, ordering, for, their, letters, this, makes, alphabets, a, useful, tool, in, collation, as, words, can, be, listed, in, a, well, defined, order, commonly, known, as, alphabetical, order, this, also, means, that, letters, may, be, used, as, a, method, of, numbering, ordered, items, letters, also, have, names, in, some, languages, this, is, known, as, acrophony, and, it, is, present, in, scripts, including, greek, arabic, hebrew, and, syriac, however, acrophony, is, not, present, in, all, languages, such, as, the, latin, alphabet, which, simply, adds, a, vowel, after, the, character, representing, each, letter, some, systems, also, used, to, have, acrophony, but, later, abandoned, it, such, as, cyrillic, the, english, word, alphabet, came, into, middle, english, from, the, late, latin, word, alphabetum, which, in, turn, originated, in, the, greek, alph, b, tos, it, was, made, from, the, first, two, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, alpha, and, beta, the, names, for, the, greek, letters, in, turn, came, from, the, first, two, letters, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, aleph, the, word, for, ox, and, bet, the, word, for, house, the, ancient, egyptian, writing, system, had, a, set, of, some, 24, hieroglyphs, that, are, called, uniliterals, which, are, glyphs, that, provide, one, sound, these, glyphs, were, used, as, pronunciation, guides, for, logograms, to, write, grammatical, inflections, and, later, to, transcribe, loan, words, and, foreign, names, the, script, was, used, a, fair, amount, in, the, 4th, century, ce, however, after, pagan, temples, were, closed, down, it, was, forgotten, in, the, 5th, century, until, the, discovery, of, the, rosetta, stone, there, was, also, cuneiform, primarily, used, to, write, several, ancient, languages, including, sumerian, the, last, known, use, of, the, cuneiform, script, was, in, 75, ce, after, which, the, script, fell, out, of, use, in, the, middle, bronze, age, an, apparently, alphabetic, system, known, as, the, proto, sinaitic, script, appeared, in, egyptian, turquoise, mines, in, the, sinai, peninsula, around, 1840, bce, apparently, left, by, canaanite, workers, orly, goldwasser, has, connected, the, illiterate, turquoise, miner, graffiti, theory, to, the, origin, of, the, alphabet, in, 1999, american, egyptologists, john, and, deborah, darnell, discovered, an, earlier, version, of, this, first, alphabet, at, the, wadi, el, hol, valley, the, script, dated, to, c, 1800, bce, and, shows, evidence, of, having, been, adapted, from, specific, forms, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, that, could, be, dated, to, c, 2000, bce, strongly, suggesting, that, the, first, alphabet, had, developed, about, that, time, the, script, was, based, on, letter, appearances, and, names, believed, to, be, based, on, egyptian, hieroglyphs, this, script, had, no, characters, representing, vowels, originally, it, probably, was, a, syllabary, a, script, where, syllables, are, represented, with, characters, with, symbols, that, were, not, needed, being, removed, the, best, attested, bronze, age, alphabet, is, ugaritic, invented, in, ugarit, before, the, 15th, century, bce, this, was, an, alphabetic, cuneiform, script, with, 30, signs, including, three, that, indicate, the, following, vowel, this, script, was, not, used, after, the, destruction, of, ugarit, in, 1178, bce, the, proto, sinaitic, script, eventually, developed, into, the, phoenician, alphabet, conventionally, called, proto, canaanite, before, c, 1050, bce, the, oldest, text, in, phoenician, script, is, an, inscription, on, the, sarcophagus, of, king, ahiram, c, 1000, bce, this, script, is, the, parent, script, of, all, western, alphabets, by, the, 10th, century, bce, two, other, forms, distinguish, themselves, canaanite, and, aramaic, the, aramaic, gave, rise, to, the, hebrew, alphabet, the, south, arabian, alphabet, a, sister, script, to, the, phoenician, alphabet, is, the, script, from, which, the, ge, ez, abugida, was, descended, abugidas, are, writing, systems, with, characters, comprising, consonant, vowel, sequences, alphabets, without, obligatory, vowels, are, called, abjads, with, examples, being, arabic, hebrew, and, syriac, the, omission, of, vowels, was, not, always, a, satisfactory, solution, due, to, the, need, of, preserving, sacred, texts, weak, consonants, are, used, to, indicate, vowels, these, letters, have, a, dual, function, since, they, can, also, be, used, as, pure, consonants, the, proto, sinaitic, script, and, the, ugaritic, script, were, the, first, scripts, with, a, limited, number, of, signs, instead, of, using, many, different, signs, for, words, in, contrast, to, cuneiform, egyptian, hieroglyphs, and, linear, b, the, phoenician, script, was, probably, the, first, phonemic, script, and, it, contained, only, about, two, dozen, distinct, letters, making, it, a, script, simple, enough, for, traders, to, learn, another, advantage, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, was, that, it, could, write, different, languages, since, it, recorded, words, phonemically, the, phoenician, script, was, spread, across, the, mediterranean, by, the, phoenicians, the, greek, alphabet, was, the, first, alphabet, in, which, vowels, have, independent, letter, forms, separate, from, those, of, consonants, the, greeks, chose, letters, representing, sounds, that, did, not, exist, in, phoenician, to, represent, vowels, the, linear, b, syllabary, used, by, mycenaean, greeks, from, the, 16th, century, bce, had, 87, symbols, including, five, vowels, in, its, early, years, there, were, many, variants, of, the, greek, alphabet, causing, many, different, alphabets, to, evolve, from, it, the, greek, alphabet, in, euboean, form, was, carried, over, by, greek, colonists, to, the, italian, peninsula, c, 800, 600, bce, giving, rise, to, many, different, alphabets, used, to, write, the, italic, languages, like, the, etruscan, alphabet, one, of, these, became, the, latin, alphabet, which, spread, across, europe, as, the, romans, expanded, their, republic, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, alphabet, survived, in, intellectual, and, religious, works, it, came, to, be, used, for, the, descendant, languages, of, latin, the, romance, languages, and, most, of, the, other, languages, of, western, and, central, europe, today, it, is, the, most, widely, used, script, in, the, world, the, etruscan, alphabet, remained, nearly, unchanged, for, several, hundred, years, only, evolving, once, the, etruscan, language, changed, itself, the, letters, used, for, non, existent, phonemes, were, dropped, afterwards, however, the, alphabet, went, through, many, different, changes, the, final, classical, form, of, etruscan, contained, 20, letters, four, of, them, are, vowels, a, e, i, and, u, six, fewer, letters, than, the, earlier, forms, the, script, in, its, classical, form, was, used, until, the, 1st, century, ce, the, etruscan, language, itself, was, not, used, in, imperial, rome, but, the, script, was, used, for, religious, texts, some, adaptations, of, the, latin, alphabet, have, ligatures, a, combination, of, two, letters, make, one, such, as, in, danish, and, icelandic, and, in, algonquian, borrowings, from, other, alphabets, such, as, the, thorn, in, old, english, and, icelandic, which, came, from, the, futhark, runes, and, modified, existing, letters, such, as, the, eth, of, old, english, and, icelandic, which, is, a, modified, d, other, alphabets, only, use, a, subset, of, the, latin, alphabet, such, as, hawaiian, and, italian, which, uses, the, letters, j, k, x, y, and, w, only, in, foreign, words, another, notable, script, is, elder, futhark, believed, to, have, evolved, out, of, one, of, the, old, italic, alphabets, elder, futhark, gave, rise, to, other, alphabets, known, collectively, as, the, runic, alphabets, the, runic, alphabets, were, used, for, germanic, languages, from, 100, ce, to, the, late, middle, ages, being, engraved, on, stone, and, jewelry, although, inscriptions, found, on, bone, and, wood, occasionally, appear, these, alphabets, have, since, been, replaced, with, the, latin, alphabet, the, exception, was, for, decorative, use, where, the, runes, remained, in, use, until, the, 20th, century, the, old, hungarian, script, was, the, writing, system, of, the, hungarians, it, was, in, use, during, the, entire, history, of, hungary, albeit, not, as, an, official, writing, system, from, the, 19th, century, it, once, again, became, more, and, more, popular, the, glagolitic, alphabet, was, the, initial, script, of, the, liturgical, language, old, church, slavonic, and, became, together, with, the, greek, uncial, script, the, basis, of, the, cyrillic, script, cyrillic, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, modern, alphabetic, scripts, and, is, notable, for, its, use, in, slavic, languages, and, also, for, other, languages, within, the, former, soviet, union, cyrillic, alphabets, include, serbian, macedonian, bulgarian, russian, belarusian, and, ukrainian, the, glagolitic, alphabet, is, believed, to, have, been, created, by, saints, cyril, and, methodius, while, the, cyrillic, alphabet, was, created, by, clement, of, ohrid, their, disciple, they, feature, many, letters, that, appear, to, have, been, borrowed, from, or, influenced, by, greek, and, hebrew, many, phonetic, scripts, exist, in, asia, the, arabic, alphabet, hebrew, alphabet, syriac, alphabet, and, other, abjads, of, the, middle, east, are, developments, of, the, aramaic, alphabet, most, alphabetic, scripts, of, india, and, eastern, asia, descend, from, the, brahmi, script, believed, to, be, a, descendant, of, aramaic, european, alphabets, especially, latin, and, cyrillic, have, been, adapted, for, many, languages, of, asia, arabic, is, also, widely, used, sometimes, as, an, abjad, as, with, urdu, and, persian, and, sometimes, as, a, complete, alphabet, as, with, kurdish, and, uyghur, in, korea, sejong, the, great, created, the, hangul, alphabet, in, 1443, ce, hangul, is, a, unique, alphabet, it, is, a, featural, alphabet, where, the, design, of, many, of, the, letters, comes, from, a, sound, s, place, of, articulation, like, p, looking, like, the, widened, mouth, and, l, looking, like, the, tongue, pulled, in, the, creation, of, hangul, was, planned, by, the, government, of, the, day, and, it, places, individual, letters, in, syllable, clusters, with, equal, dimensions, in, the, same, way, as, chinese, characters, this, change, allows, for, mixed, script, writing, where, one, syllable, always, takes, up, one, type, space, no, matter, how, many, letters, get, stacked, into, building, that, one, sound, block, zhuyin, sometimes, referred, to, as, bopomofo, is, a, semi, syllabary, it, transcribes, mandarin, phonetically, in, the, republic, of, china, after, the, later, establishment, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, its, adoption, of, hanyu, pinyin, the, use, of, zhuyin, today, is, limited, however, it, is, still, widely, used, in, taiwan, zhuyin, developed, from, a, form, of, chinese, shorthand, based, on, chinese, characters, in, the, early, 1900s, and, has, elements, of, both, an, alphabet, and, a, syllabary, like, an, alphabet, the, phonemes, of, syllable, initials, are, represented, by, individual, symbols, but, like, a, syllabary, the, phonemes, of, the, syllable, finals, are, not, each, possible, final, excluding, the, medial, glide, has, its, own, character, an, example, being, luan, written, as, l, u, an, the, last, symbol, takes, place, as, the, entire, final, an, while, zhuyin, is, not, a, mainstream, writing, system, it, is, still, often, used, in, ways, similar, to, a, romanization, system, for, aiding, pronunciation, and, as, an, input, method, for, chinese, characters, on, computers, and, cellphones, the, term, alphabet, is, used, by, linguists, and, paleographers, in, both, a, wide, and, a, narrow, sense, in, a, broader, sense, an, alphabet, is, a, segmental, script, at, the, phoneme, level, that, is, it, has, separate, glyphs, for, individual, sounds, and, not, for, larger, units, such, as, syllables, or, words, in, the, narrower, sense, some, scholars, distinguish, true, alphabets, from, two, other, types, of, segmental, script, abjads, and, abugidas, these, three, differ, in, how, they, treat, vowels, abjads, have, letters, for, consonants, and, leave, most, vowels, unexpressed, abugidas, are, also, consonant, based, but, indicate, vowels, with, diacritics, a, systematic, graphic, modification, of, the, consonants, the, earliest, known, alphabet, using, this, sense, is, the, wadi, el, hol, script, believed, to, be, an, abjad, its, successor, phoenician, is, the, ancestor, of, modern, alphabets, including, arabic, greek, latin, via, the, old, italic, alphabet, cyrillic, via, the, greek, alphabet, and, hebrew, via, aramaic, examples, of, present, day, abjads, are, the, arabic, and, hebrew, scripts, true, alphabets, include, latin, cyrillic, and, korean, hangul, and, abugidas, used, to, write, tigrinya, amharic, hindi, and, thai, the, canadian, aboriginal, syllabics, are, also, an, abugida, rather, than, a, syllabary, as, their, name, would, imply, because, each, glyph, stands, for, a, consonant, and, is, modified, by, rotation, to, represent, the, following, vowel, in, a, true, syllabary, each, consonant, vowel, combination, gets, represented, by, a, separate, glyph, all, three, types, may, be, augmented, with, syllabic, glyphs, ugaritic, for, example, is, essentially, an, abjad, but, has, syllabic, letters, for, a, i, u, these, are, the, only, times, that, vowels, are, indicated, coptic, has, a, letter, for, ti, devanagari, is, typically, an, abugida, augmented, with, dedicated, letters, for, initial, vowels, though, some, traditions, use, as, a, zero, consonant, as, the, graphic, base, for, such, vowels, the, boundaries, between, the, three, types, of, segmental, scripts, are, not, always, clear, cut, for, example, sorani, kurdish, is, written, in, the, arabic, script, which, when, used, for, other, languages, is, an, abjad, in, kurdish, writing, the, vowels, is, mandatory, and, whole, letters, are, used, so, the, script, is, a, true, alphabet, other, languages, may, use, a, semitic, abjad, with, forced, vowel, diacritics, effectively, making, them, abugidas, on, the, other, hand, the, phagspa, script, of, the, mongol, empire, was, based, closely, on, the, tibetan, abugida, but, vowel, marks, are, written, after, the, preceding, consonant, rather, than, as, diacritic, marks, although, short, a, is, not, written, as, in, the, indic, abugidas, the, source, of, the, term, abugida, namely, the, ge, ez, abugida, now, used, for, amharic, and, tigrinya, has, assimilated, into, their, consonant, modifications, it, is, no, longer, systematic, and, must, be, learned, as, a, syllabary, rather, than, as, a, segmental, script, even, more, extreme, the, pahlavi, abjad, eventually, became, logographic, thus, the, primary, categorisation, of, alphabets, reflects, how, they, treat, vowels, for, tonal, languages, further, classification, can, be, based, on, their, treatment, of, tone, though, names, do, not, yet, exist, to, distinguish, the, various, types, some, alphabets, disregard, tone, entirely, especially, when, it, does, not, carry, a, heavy, functional, load, as, in, somali, and, many, other, languages, of, africa, and, the, americas, most, commonly, tones, are, indicated, by, diacritics, which, is, how, vowels, are, treated, in, abugidas, which, is, the, case, for, vietnamese, a, true, alphabet, and, thai, an, abugida, in, thai, the, tone, is, determined, primarily, by, a, consonant, with, diacritics, for, disambiguation, in, the, pollard, script, an, abugida, vowels, are, indicated, by, diacritics, the, placing, of, the, diacritic, relative, to, the, consonant, is, modified, to, indicate, the, tone, more, rarely, a, script, may, have, separate, letters, for, tones, as, is, the, case, for, hmong, and, zhuang, for, many, regardless, of, whether, letters, or, diacritics, get, used, the, most, common, tone, is, not, marked, just, as, the, most, common, vowel, is, not, marked, in, indic, abugidas, in, zhuyin, not, only, is, one, of, the, tones, unmarked, but, there, is, a, diacritic, to, indicate, a, lack, of, tone, like, the, virama, of, indic, alphabets, often, come, to, be, associated, with, a, standard, ordering, of, their, letters, this, is, for, collation, namely, for, listing, words, and, other, items, in, alphabetical, order, the, basic, ordering, of, the, latin, alphabet, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, which, derives, from, the, northwest, semitic, abgad, order, is, already, well, established, although, languages, using, this, alphabet, have, different, conventions, for, their, treatment, of, modified, letters, such, as, the, french, and, and, certain, combinations, of, letters, multigraphs, in, french, these, are, not, considered, to, be, additional, letters, for, collation, however, in, icelandic, the, accented, letters, such, as, and, are, considered, distinct, letters, representing, different, vowel, sounds, from, sounds, represented, by, their, unaccented, counterparts, in, spanish, is, considered, a, separate, letter, but, accented, vowels, such, as, and, are, not, the, ll, and, ch, were, also, formerly, considered, single, letters, and, sorted, separately, after, l, and, c, but, in, 1994, the, tenth, congress, of, the, association, of, spanish, language, academies, changed, the, collating, order, so, that, ll, came, to, be, sorted, between, lk, and, lm, in, the, dictionary, and, ch, came, to, be, sorted, between, cg, and, ci, those, digraphs, were, still, formally, designated, as, letters, but, in, 2010, the, real, academia, espa, ola, changed, it, so, they, are, no, longer, considered, letters, at, all, in, german, words, starting, with, sch, which, spells, the, german, phoneme, are, inserted, between, words, with, initial, sca, and, sci, all, incidentally, loanwords, instead, of, appearing, after, the, initial, sz, as, though, it, were, a, single, letter, which, contrasts, several, languages, such, as, albanian, in, which, dh, gj, ll, rr, th, xh, and, zh, which, all, represent, phonemes, and, considered, separate, single, letters, would, follow, the, letters, d, e, g, l, n, r, t, x, and, z, respectively, as, well, as, hungarian, and, welsh, further, german, words, with, an, umlaut, get, collated, ignoring, the, umlaut, as, contrary, to, turkish, which, adopted, the, graphemes, and, and, where, a, word, like, t, fek, would, come, after, tuz, in, the, dictionary, an, exception, is, the, german, telephone, directory, where, umlauts, are, sorted, like, ae, since, names, such, as, j, ger, also, appear, with, the, spelling, jaeger, and, are, not, distinguished, in, the, spoken, language, the, danish, and, norwegian, alphabets, end, with, whereas, the, swedish, conventionally, put, at, the, end, however, phonetically, corresponds, with, as, does, and, it, is, unknown, whether, the, earliest, alphabets, had, a, defined, sequence, some, alphabets, today, such, as, the, hanuno, o, script, are, learned, one, letter, at, a, time, in, no, particular, order, and, are, not, used, for, collation, where, a, definite, order, is, required, however, a, dozen, ugaritic, tablets, from, the, fourteenth, century, bce, preserve, the, alphabet, in, two, sequences, one, the, abcde, order, later, used, in, phoenician, has, continued, with, minor, changes, in, hebrew, greek, armenian, gothic, cyrillic, and, latin, the, other, hm, lq, was, used, in, southern, arabia, and, is, preserved, today, in, ethiopic, both, orders, have, therefore, been, stable, for, at, least, 3000, years, runic, used, an, unrelated, futhark, sequence, which, got, simplified, later, on, arabic, usually, uses, its, sequence, although, arabic, retains, the, traditional, abjadi, order, which, is, used, for, numbers, the, brahmic, family, of, alphabets, used, in, india, uses, a, unique, order, based, on, phonology, the, letters, are, arranged, according, to, how, and, where, the, sounds, get, produced, in, the, mouth, this, organization, is, present, in, southeast, asia, tibet, korean, hangul, and, even, japanese, kana, which, is, not, an, alphabet, in, phoenician, each, letter, got, associated, with, a, word, that, begins, with, that, sound, this, is, called, acrophony, and, is, continuously, used, to, varying, degrees, in, samaritan, aramaic, syriac, hebrew, greek, and, arabic, acrophony, got, abandoned, in, latin, it, referred, to, the, letters, by, adding, a, vowel, usually, e, sometimes, a, or, u, before, or, after, the, consonant, two, exceptions, were, y, and, z, which, were, borrowed, from, the, greek, alphabet, rather, than, etruscan, they, were, known, as, y, graeca, greek, y, and, zeta, from, greek, this, discrepancy, was, inherited, by, many, european, languages, as, in, the, term, zed, for, z, in, all, forms, of, english, other, than, american, english, over, time, names, sometimes, shifted, or, were, added, as, in, double, u, for, w, or, double, v, in, french, the, english, name, for, y, and, the, american, zee, for, z, comparing, them, in, english, and, french, gives, a, clear, reflection, of, the, great, vowel, shift, a, b, c, and, d, are, pronounced, e, bi, si, di, in, today, s, english, but, in, contemporary, french, they, are, a, be, se, de, the, french, names, from, which, the, english, names, got, derived, preserve, the, qualities, of, the, english, vowels, before, the, great, vowel, shift, by, contrast, the, names, of, f, l, m, n, and, s, f, l, m, n, s, remain, the, same, in, both, languages, because, short, vowels, were, largely, unaffected, by, the, shift, in, cyrillic, originally, acrophony, was, present, using, slavic, words, the, first, three, words, going, az, buky, v, d, with, the, cyrillic, collation, order, being, however, this, was, later, abandoned, in, favor, of, a, system, similar, to, latin, when, an, alphabet, is, adopted, or, developed, to, represent, a, given, language, an, orthography, generally, comes, into, being, providing, rules, for, spelling, words, following, the, principle, on, which, alphabets, get, based, these, rules, will, map, letters, of, the, alphabet, to, the, phonemes, of, the, spoken, language, in, a, perfectly, phonemic, orthography, there, would, be, a, consistent, one, to, one, correspondence, between, the, letters, and, the, phonemes, so, that, a, writer, could, predict, the, spelling, of, a, word, given, its, pronunciation, and, a, speaker, would, always, know, the, pronunciation, of, a, word, given, its, spelling, and, vice, versa, however, this, ideal, is, usually, never, achieved, in, practice, languages, can, come, close, to, it, such, as, spanish, and, finnish, others, such, as, english, deviate, from, it, to, a, much, larger, degree, the, pronunciation, of, a, language, often, evolves, independently, of, its, writing, system, writing, systems, have, been, borrowed, for, languages, the, orthography, was, not, initially, made, to, use, the, degree, to, which, letters, of, an, alphabet, correspond, to, phonemes, of, a, language, varies, languages, may, fail, to, achieve, a, one, to, one, correspondence, between, letters, and, sounds, in, any, of, several, ways, national, languages, sometimes, elect, to, address, the, problem, of, dialects, by, associating, the, alphabet, with, the, national, standard, some, national, languages, like, finnish, armenian, turkish, russian, serbo, croatian, serbian, croatian, and, bosnian, and, bulgarian, have, a, very, regular, spelling, system, with, nearly, one, to, one, correspondence, between, letters, and, phonemes, similarly, the, italian, verb, corresponding, to, spell, out, compitare, is, unknown, to, many, italians, because, spelling, is, usually, trivial, as, italian, spelling, is, highly, phonemic, in, standard, spanish, one, can, tell, the, pronunciation, of, a, word, from, its, spelling, but, not, vice, versa, as, phonemes, sometimes, can, be, represented, in, more, than, one, way, but, a, given, letter, is, consistently, pronounced, french, using, silent, letters, nasal, vowels, and, elision, may, seem, to, lack, much, correspondence, between, the, spelling, and, pronunciation, however, its, rules, on, pronunciation, though, complex, are, consistent, and, predictable, with, a, fair, degree, of, accuracy, at, the, other, extreme, are, languages, such, as, english, where, pronunciations, mostly, have, to, be, memorized, as, they, do, not, correspond, to, the, spelling, consistently, for, english, this, is, because, the, great, vowel, shift, occurred, after, the, orthography, got, established, and, because, english, has, acquired, a, large, number, of, loanwords, at, different, times, retaining, their, original, spelling, at, varying, levels, however, even, english, has, general, albeit, complex, rules, that, predict, pronunciation, from, spelling, rules, like, this, are, usually, successful, however, rules, to, predict, spelling, from, pronunciation, have, a, higher, failure, rate, sometimes, countries, have, the, written, language, undergo, a, spelling, reform, to, realign, the, writing, with, the, contemporary, spoken, language, these, can, range, from, simple, spelling, changes, and, word, forms, to, switching, the, entire, writing, system, for, example, turkey, switched, from, the, arabic, alphabet, to, a, latin, based, turkish, alphabet, and, kazakh, changed, from, an, arabic, script, to, a, cyrillic, script, due, to, the, soviet, union, s, influence, in, 2021, it, made, a, transition, to, the, latin, alphabet, similar, to, turkish, the, cyrillic, script, used, to, be, official, in, uzbekistan, and, turkmenistan, before, they, switched, to, the, latin, alphabet, uzbekistan, is, reforming, the, alphabet, to, use, diacritics, on, the, letters, that, are, marked, by, apostrophes, and, the, letters, that, are, digraphs, the, standard, system, of, symbols, used, by, linguists, to, represent, sounds, in, any, language, independently, of, orthography, is, called, the, international, phonetic, alphabet
