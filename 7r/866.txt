1800s, martineau, tocqueville, marx, spencer, le, bon, ward, pareto, t, nnies, veblen, simmel, durkheim, addams, mead, weber, du, bois, mannheim, elias, in, political, science, power, is, the, social, production, of, an, effect, that, determines, the, capacities, actions, beliefs, or, conduct, of, actors, power, does, not, exclusively, refer, to, the, threat, or, use, of, force, coercion, by, one, actor, against, another, but, may, also, be, exerted, through, diffuse, means, such, as, institutions, power, may, also, take, structural, forms, as, it, orders, actors, in, relation, to, one, another, such, as, distinguishing, between, a, master, and, an, enslaved, person, a, householder, and, their, relatives, an, employer, and, their, employees, a, parent, and, a, child, a, political, representative, and, their, voters, etc, and, discursive, forms, as, categories, and, language, may, lend, legitimacy, to, some, behaviors, and, groups, over, others, the, term, authority, is, often, used, for, power, that, is, perceived, as, legitimate, or, socially, approved, by, the, social, structure, power, can, be, seen, as, evil, or, unjust, however, power, can, also, be, seen, as, good, and, as, something, inherited, or, given, for, exercising, humanistic, objectives, that, will, help, move, and, empower, others, as, well, scholars, have, distinguished, the, differences, between, soft, power, and, hard, power, in, a, now, classic, study, 1959, social, psychologists, john, r, p, french, and, bertram, raven, developed, a, schema, of, sources, of, power, by, which, to, analyse, how, power, plays, work, or, fail, to, work, in, a, specific, relationship, according, to, french, and, raven, power, must, be, distinguished, from, influence, in, the, following, way, power, is, that, state, of, affairs, that, holds, in, a, given, relationship, a, b, such, that, a, given, influence, attempt, by, a, over, b, makes, a, s, desired, change, in, b, more, likely, conceived, this, way, power, is, fundamentally, relative, it, depends, on, the, specific, understandings, a, and, b, each, apply, to, their, relationship, and, requires, b, s, recognition, of, a, quality, in, a, that, would, motivate, b, to, change, in, the, way, a, intends, a, must, draw, on, the, base, or, combination, of, bases, of, power, appropriate, to, the, relationship, to, effect, the, desired, outcome, drawing, on, the, wrong, power, base, can, have, unintended, effects, including, a, reduction, in, a, s, own, power, french, and, raven, argue, that, there, are, five, significant, categories, of, such, qualities, while, not, excluding, other, minor, categories, further, bases, have, since, been, adduced, in, particular, by, gareth, morgan, in, his, 1986, book, images, of, organization, also, called, positional, power, legitimate, power, is, the, power, of, an, individual, because, of, the, relative, position, and, duties, of, the, holder, of, the, position, within, an, organization, legitimate, power, is, formal, authority, delegated, to, the, holder, of, the, position, it, is, usually, accompanied, by, various, attributes, of, power, such, as, a, uniform, a, title, or, an, imposing, physical, office, in, simple, terms, power, can, be, expressed, as, being, upward, or, downward, with, downward, power, a, company, s, superiors, influence, subordinates, to, attain, organizational, goals, when, a, company, exhibits, upward, power, subordinates, influence, the, decisions, of, their, leader, or, leaders, referent, power, is, the, power, or, ability, of, individuals, to, attract, others, and, build, loyalty, it, is, based, on, the, charisma, and, interpersonal, skills, of, the, powerholder, a, person, may, be, admired, because, of, a, specific, personal, trait, and, this, admiration, creates, the, opportunity, for, interpersonal, influence, here, the, person, under, power, desires, to, identify, with, these, personal, qualities, and, gains, satisfaction, from, being, an, accepted, follower, nationalism, and, patriotism, count, towards, an, intangible, sort, of, referent, power, for, example, soldiers, fight, in, wars, to, defend, the, honor, of, the, country, this, is, the, second, least, obvious, power, but, the, most, effective, advertisers, have, long, used, the, referent, power, of, sports, figures, for, product, endorsements, for, example, the, charismatic, appeal, of, the, sports, star, supposedly, leads, to, an, acceptance, of, the, endorsement, although, the, individual, may, have, little, real, credibility, outside, the, sports, arena, abuse, is, possible, when, someone, who, is, likable, yet, lacks, integrity, and, honesty, rises, to, power, placing, them, in, a, situation, to, gain, personal, advantage, at, the, cost, of, the, group, s, position, referent, power, is, unstable, alone, and, is, not, enough, for, a, leader, who, wants, longevity, and, respect, when, combined, with, other, sources, of, power, however, it, can, help, a, person, achieve, great, success, expert, power, is, an, individual, s, power, deriving, from, the, skills, or, expertise, of, the, person, and, the, organization, s, needs, for, those, skills, and, expertise, unlike, the, others, this, type, of, power, is, usually, highly, specific, and, limited, to, the, particular, area, in, which, the, expert, is, trained, and, qualified, when, they, have, knowledge, and, skills, that, enable, them, to, understand, a, situation, suggest, solutions, use, solid, judgment, and, generally, outperform, others, then, people, tend, to, listen, to, them, when, individuals, demonstrate, expertise, people, tend, to, trust, them, and, respect, what, they, say, as, subject, matter, experts, their, ideas, will, have, more, value, and, others, will, look, to, them, for, leadership, in, that, area, reward, power, depends, on, the, ability, of, the, power, wielder, to, confer, valued, material, rewards, it, refers, to, the, degree, to, which, the, individual, can, give, others, a, reward, of, some, kind, such, as, benefits, time, off, desired, gifts, promotions, or, increases, in, pay, or, responsibility, this, power, is, obvious, but, it, is, also, ineffective, if, abused, people, who, abuse, reward, power, can, become, pushy, or, be, reprimanded, for, being, too, forthcoming, or, moving, things, too, quickly, if, others, expect, to, be, rewarded, for, doing, what, someone, wants, there, is, a, high, probability, that, they, will, do, it, the, problem, with, this, basis, of, power, is, that, the, rewarder, may, not, have, as, much, control, over, rewards, as, may, be, required, supervisors, rarely, have, complete, control, over, salary, increases, and, managers, often, cannot, control, all, actions, in, isolation, even, a, company, ceo, needs, permission, from, the, board, of, directors, for, some, actions, when, an, individual, uses, up, available, rewards, or, the, rewards, do, not, have, enough, perceived, value, for, others, their, power, weakens, one, of, the, frustrations, of, using, rewards, is, that, they, often, need, to, be, bigger, each, time, if, they, are, to, have, the, same, motivational, impact, even, then, if, rewards, are, given, frequently, people, can, become, so, satiated, by, the, reward, it, loses, its, effectiveness, in, terms, of, cancel, culture, the, mass, ostracization, used, to, reconcile, unchecked, injustice, and, abuse, of, power, is, an, upward, power, policies, for, policing, the, internet, against, these, processes, as, a, pathway, for, creating, due, process, for, handling, conflicts, abuses, and, harm, that, is, done, through, established, processes, are, known, as, downward, power, coercive, power, is, the, application, of, negative, influences, it, includes, the, ability, to, defer, or, withhold, other, rewards, the, desire, for, valued, rewards, or, the, fear, of, having, them, withheld, can, ensure, the, obedience, of, those, under, power, coercive, power, tends, to, be, the, most, obvious, but, least, effective, form, of, power, as, it, builds, resentment, and, resistance, from, the, people, who, experience, it, threats, and, punishment, are, common, tools, of, coercion, implying, or, threatening, that, someone, will, be, fired, demoted, denied, privileges, or, given, undesirable, assignments, these, are, characteristics, of, using, coercive, power, extensive, use, of, coercive, power, is, rarely, appropriate, in, an, organizational, setting, and, relying, on, these, forms, of, power, alone, will, result, in, a, very, cold, impoverished, style, of, leadership, this, is, a, type, of, power, commonly, seen, in, the, fashion, industry, by, coupling, with, legitimate, power, it, is, referred, to, in, the, industry, specific, literature, as, glamorization, of, structural, domination, and, exploitation, according, to, laura, k, guerrero, and, peter, a, andersen, in, close, encounters, communication, in, relationships, game, theory, with, its, foundations, in, the, walrasian, theory, of, rational, choice, is, increasingly, used, in, various, disciplines, to, help, analyze, power, relationships, one, rational, choice, definition, of, power, is, given, by, keith, dowding, in, his, book, power, in, rational, choice, theory, human, individuals, or, groups, can, be, modelled, as, actors, who, choose, from, a, choice, set, of, possible, actions, in, order, to, try, to, achieve, desired, outcomes, an, actor, s, incentive, structure, comprises, its, beliefs, about, the, costs, associated, with, different, actions, in, the, choice, set, and, the, likelihoods, that, different, actions, will, lead, to, desired, outcomes, in, this, setting, we, can, differentiate, between, this, framework, can, be, used, to, model, a, wide, range, of, social, interactions, where, actors, have, the, ability, to, exert, power, over, others, for, example, a, powerful, actor, can, take, options, away, from, another, s, choice, set, can, change, the, relative, costs, of, actions, can, change, the, likelihood, that, a, given, action, will, lead, to, a, given, outcome, or, might, simply, change, the, other, s, beliefs, about, its, incentive, structure, as, with, other, models, of, power, this, framework, is, neutral, as, to, the, use, of, coercion, for, example, a, threat, of, violence, can, change, the, likely, costs, and, benefits, of, different, actions, so, can, a, financial, penalty, in, a, voluntarily, agreed, contract, or, indeed, a, friendly, offer, in, the, marxist, tradition, the, italian, writer, antonio, gramsci, elaborated, on, the, role, of, ideology, in, creating, a, cultural, hegemony, which, becomes, a, means, of, bolstering, the, power, of, capitalism, and, of, the, nation, state, drawing, on, niccol, machiavelli, in, the, prince, and, trying, to, understand, why, there, had, been, no, communist, revolution, in, western, europe, while, it, was, claimed, there, had, been, one, in, russia, gramsci, conceptualised, this, hegemony, as, a, centaur, consisting, of, two, halves, the, back, end, the, beast, represented, the, more, classic, material, image, of, power, power, through, coercion, through, brute, force, be, it, physical, or, economic, but, the, capitalist, hegemony, he, argued, depended, even, more, strongly, on, the, front, end, the, human, face, which, projected, power, through, consent, in, russia, this, power, was, lacking, allowing, for, a, revolution, however, in, western, europe, specifically, in, italy, capitalism, had, succeeded, in, exercising, consensual, power, convincing, the, working, classes, that, their, interests, were, the, same, as, those, of, capitalists, in, this, way, a, revolution, had, been, avoided, while, gramsci, stresses, the, significance, of, ideology, in, power, structures, marxist, feminist, writers, such, as, michele, barrett, stress, the, role, of, ideologies, in, extolling, the, virtues, of, family, life, the, classic, argument, to, illustrate, this, point, of, view, is, the, use, of, women, as, a, reserve, army, of, labour, in, wartime, it, is, accepted, that, women, perform, masculine, tasks, while, after, the, war, the, roles, are, easily, reversed, therefore, according, to, barrett, the, destruction, of, capitalist, economic, relations, is, necessary, but, not, sufficient, for, the, liberation, of, women, eugen, tarnow, considers, what, power, hijackers, have, over, air, plane, passengers, and, draws, similarities, with, power, in, the, military, he, shows, that, power, over, an, individual, can, be, amplified, by, the, presence, of, a, group, if, the, group, conforms, to, the, leader, s, commands, the, leader, s, power, over, an, individual, is, greatly, enhanced, while, if, the, group, does, not, conform, the, leader, s, power, over, an, individual, is, nil, for, michel, foucault, the, real, power, will, always, rely, on, the, ignorance, of, its, agents, no, single, human, group, or, actor, runs, the, dispositif, machine, or, apparatus, but, power, is, dispersed, through, the, apparatus, as, efficiently, and, silently, as, possible, ensuring, its, agents, do, whatever, is, necessary, it, is, because, of, this, action, that, power, is, unlikely, to, be, detected, and, remains, elusive, to, rational, investigation, foucault, quotes, a, text, reputedly, written, by, political, economist, jean, baptiste, antoine, auget, de, montyon, entitled, recherches, et, consid, rations, sur, la, population, de, la, france, 1778, but, turns, out, to, be, written, by, his, secretary, jean, baptise, moheau, 1745, 1794, and, by, emphasizing, biologist, jean, baptiste, lamarck, who, constantly, refers, to, milieus, as, a, plural, adjective, and, sees, into, the, milieu, as, an, expression, as, nothing, more, than, water, air, and, light, confirming, the, genus, within, the, milieu, in, this, case, the, human, species, relates, to, a, function, of, the, population, and, its, social, and, political, interaction, in, which, both, form, an, artificial, and, natural, milieu, this, milieu, both, artificial, and, natural, appears, as, a, target, of, intervention, for, power, according, to, foucault, which, is, radically, different, from, the, previous, notions, on, sovereignty, territory, and, disciplinary, space, interwoven, into, social, and, political, relations, that, function, as, a, species, biological, species, foucault, originated, and, developed, the, concept, of, docile, bodies, in, his, book, discipline, and, punish, he, writes, a, body, is, docile, that, may, be, subjected, used, transformed, and, improved, stewart, clegg, proposes, another, three, dimensional, model, with, his, circuits, of, power, theory, this, model, likens, the, production, and, organization, of, power, to, an, electric, circuit, board, consisting, of, three, distinct, interacting, circuits, episodic, dispositional, and, facilitative, these, circuits, operate, at, three, levels, two, are, macro, and, one, is, micro, the, episodic, circuit, is, at, the, micro, level, and, is, constituted, of, irregular, exercise, of, power, as, agents, address, feelings, communication, conflict, and, resistance, in, day, to, day, interrelations, the, outcomes, of, the, episodic, circuit, are, both, positive, and, negative, the, dispositional, circuit, is, constituted, of, macro, level, rules, of, practice, and, socially, constructed, meanings, that, inform, member, relations, and, legitimate, authority, the, facilitative, circuit, is, constituted, of, macro, level, technology, environmental, contingencies, job, design, and, networks, which, empower, or, disempower, and, thus, punish, or, reward, agency, in, the, episodic, circuit, all, three, independent, circuits, interact, at, obligatory, passage, points, which, are, channels, for, empowerment, or, disempowerment, john, kenneth, galbraith, 1908, 2006, in, the, anatomy, of, power, 1983, summarizes, the, types, of, power, as, condign, based, on, force, compensatory, through, the, use, of, various, resources, or, conditioned, the, result, of, persuasion, and, the, sources, of, power, as, personality, individuals, property, power, wielders, material, resources, and, or, organizational, from, sitting, higher, in, an, organisational, power, structure, gene, sharp, an, american, professor, of, political, science, believes, that, power, ultimately, depends, on, its, bases, thus, a, political, regime, maintains, power, because, people, accept, and, obey, its, dictates, laws, and, policies, sharp, cites, the, insight, of, tienne, de, la, bo, tie, sharp, s, key, theme, is, that, power, is, not, monolithic, that, is, it, does, not, derive, from, some, intrinsic, quality, of, those, who, are, in, power, for, sharp, political, power, the, power, of, any, state, regardless, of, its, particular, structural, organization, ultimately, derives, from, the, subjects, of, the, state, his, fundamental, belief, is, that, any, power, structure, relies, upon, the, subjects, obedience, to, the, orders, of, the, ruler, s, if, subjects, do, not, obey, leaders, have, no, power, his, work, is, thought, to, have, been, influential, in, the, overthrow, of, slobodan, milo, evi, in, the, 2011, arab, spring, and, other, nonviolent, revolutions, bj, rn, kraus, deals, with, the, epistemological, perspective, on, power, regarding, the, question, of, the, possibilities, of, interpersonal, influence, by, developing, a, special, form, of, constructivism, named, relational, constructivism, instead, of, focusing, on, the, valuation, and, distribution, of, power, he, asks, first, and, foremost, what, the, term, can, describe, at, all, coming, from, max, weber, s, definition, of, power, he, realizes, that, the, term, power, has, to, be, split, into, instructive, power, and, destructive, power, 105, 126, more, precisely, instructive, power, means, the, chance, to, determine, the, actions, and, thoughts, of, another, person, whereas, destructive, power, means, the, chance, to, diminish, the, opportunities, of, another, person, how, significant, this, distinction, really, is, becomes, evident, by, looking, at, the, possibilities, of, rejecting, power, attempts, rejecting, instructive, power, is, possible, rejecting, destructive, power, is, not, by, using, this, distinction, proportions, of, power, can, be, analyzed, in, a, more, sophisticated, way, helping, to, sufficiently, reflect, on, matters, of, responsibility, 139, f, this, perspective, permits, people, to, get, over, an, either, or, position, either, there, is, power, or, there, is, not, which, is, common, especially, in, epistemological, discourses, about, power, theories, and, to, introduce, the, possibility, of, an, as, well, as, position, 120, the, idea, of, unmarked, categories, originated, in, feminism, as, opposed, to, looking, at, social, difference, by, focusing, on, what, or, whom, is, perceived, to, be, different, theorists, who, use, the, idea, of, unmarked, categories, insist, that, one, must, also, look, at, how, whatever, is, normal, comes, to, be, perceived, as, unremarkable, and, what, effects, this, has, on, social, relations, attending, the, un, marked, category, is, thought, to, be, a, way, to, analyze, linguistic, and, cultural, practices, to, provide, insight, into, how, social, differences, including, power, are, produced, and, articulated, in, everyday, occurrences, according, to, the, idea, of, unmarked, categories, when, the, cultural, practices, of, people, who, occupy, positions, of, relative, power, or, can, more, easily, exercise, power, seem, obvious, they, tend, not, to, be, explicitly, articulated, and, therefore, are, perceived, as, default, or, baseline, practices, against, which, others, are, evaluated, as, different, deviant, or, aberrant, the, unmarked, category, becomes, the, standard, against, which, to, measure, everything, else, for, example, it, is, posited, that, if, a, protagonist, s, race, is, not, indicated, most, western, readers, will, assume, the, protagonist, is, white, if, a, sexual, identity, is, not, indicated, it, will, be, assumed, the, protagonist, is, heterosexual, if, the, gender, of, a, body, is, not, indicated, it, is, assumed, to, be, male, if, no, disability, is, indicated, it, will, be, assumed, the, protagonist, is, able, bodied, these, assumptions, do, not, however, mean, the, unmarked, category, is, superior, preferable, or, more, natural, nor, that, the, practices, associated, with, the, unmarked, category, require, less, social, effort, to, enact, although, the, unmarked, category, is, typically, not, explicitly, noticed, and, often, goes, overlooked, it, is, still, necessarily, visible, as, visible, but, unnoticed, and, unremarkable, membership, in, the, unmarked, category, can, be, an, index, of, power, for, example, whiteness, forms, an, unmarked, category, not, commonly, noticeable, to, the, powerful, as, they, often, fall, within, this, category, social, groups, can, hold, this, view, of, power, in, terms, of, a, variety, of, social, distinctions, such, as, race, class, gender, ability, and, sexuality, the, term, counter, power, sometimes, written, counterpower, is, used, in, a, range, of, situations, to, describe, the, countervailing, force, that, can, be, utilised, by, the, oppressed, to, counterbalance, or, erode, the, power, of, elites, a, general, definition, has, been, provided, by, the, anthropologist, david, graeber, as, a, collection, of, social, institutions, set, in, opposition, to, the, state, and, capital, from, self, governing, communities, to, radical, labor, unions, to, popular, militias, graeber, also, notes, that, counter, power, can, also, be, referred, to, as, anti, power, and, when, institutions, maintain, themselves, in, the, face, of, the, state, this, is, usually, referred, to, as, a, dual, power, situation, tim, gee, in, his, 2011, book, counterpower, making, change, happen, put, forward, the, theory, that, those, disempowered, by, governments, and, elite, groups, power, can, use, counterpower, to, counter, this, in, gee, s, model, counterpower, is, split, into, three, categories, idea, counterpower, economic, counterpower, and, physical, counterpower, although, the, term, has, come, to, prominence, through, its, use, by, participants, in, the, global, justice, anti, globalization, movement, of, the, 1990s, onwards, the, word, has, been, used, for, at, least, 60, years, for, instance, martin, buber, s, 1949, book, paths, in, utopia, includes, the, line, power, abdicates, only, under, the, stress, of, counter, power, 13, recent, experimental, psychology, suggests, that, the, more, power, one, has, the, less, one, takes, on, the, perspective, of, others, implying, that, the, powerful, have, less, empathy, adam, galinsky, along, with, several, coauthors, found, that, when, those, who, are, reminded, of, their, powerlessness, are, instructed, to, draw, es, on, their, forehead, they, are, 3, times, more, likely, to, draw, them, such, that, they, are, legible, to, others, than, those, who, are, reminded, of, their, power, powerful, people, are, also, more, likely, to, take, action, in, one, example, powerful, people, turned, off, an, irritatingly, close, fan, twice, as, much, as, less, powerful, people, researchers, have, documented, the, bystander, effect, they, found, that, powerful, people, are, three, times, as, likely, to, first, offer, help, to, a, stranger, in, distress, a, study, involving, over, 50, college, students, suggested, that, those, primed, to, feel, powerful, through, stating, power, words, were, less, susceptible, to, external, pressure, more, willing, to, give, honest, feedback, and, more, creative, power, is, defined, as, a, possibility, to, influence, others, 1137, the, use, of, power, has, evolved, over, centuries, power, also, relates, with, empathy, gaps, because, it, limits, the, interpersonal, relationship, and, compares, the, power, differences, having, power, or, not, having, power, can, cause, a, number, of, psychological, consequences, it, leads, to, strategic, versus, social, responsibilities, research, experiments, were, done, as, early, as, 1968, to, explore, power, conflict, earlier, research, proposed, that, increased, power, relates, to, increased, rewards, and, leads, one, to, approach, things, more, frequently, in, contrast, decreased, power, relates, to, more, constraint, threat, and, punishment, which, leads, to, inhibitions, it, was, concluded, that, being, powerful, leads, one, to, successful, outcomes, to, develop, negotiation, strategies, and, to, make, more, self, serving, offers, later, research, proposed, that, differences, in, power, lead, to, strategic, considerations, being, strategic, can, also, mean, to, defend, when, one, is, opposed, or, to, hurt, the, decision, maker, it, was, concluded, that, facing, one, with, more, power, leads, to, strategic, consideration, whereas, facing, one, with, less, power, leads, to, a, social, responsibility, bargaining, games, were, explored, in, 2003, and, 2004, these, studies, compared, behavior, done, in, different, power, given, situations, in, an, ultimatum, game, the, person, in, given, power, offers, an, ultimatum, and, the, recipient, would, have, to, accept, that, offer, or, else, both, the, proposer, and, the, recipient, will, receive, no, reward, in, a, dictator, game, the, person, in, given, power, offers, a, proposal, and, the, recipient, would, have, to, accept, that, offer, the, recipient, has, no, choice, of, rejecting, the, offer, the, dictator, game, gives, no, power, to, the, recipient, whereas, the, ultimatum, game, gives, some, power, to, the, recipient, the, behavior, observed, was, that, the, person, offering, the, proposal, would, act, less, strategically, than, would, the, one, offering, in, the, ultimatum, game, self, serving, also, occurred, and, a, lot, of, pro, social, behavior, was, observed, when, the, counterpart, recipient, is, completely, powerless, lack, of, strategy, social, responsibility, and, moral, consideration, is, often, observed, from, the, behavior, of, the, proposal, given, the, one, with, the, power, one, can, regard, power, as, evil, or, unjust, however, power, can, also, be, seen, as, good, and, as, something, inherited, or, given, for, exercising, humanistic, objectives, that, will, help, move, and, empower, others, as, well, in, general, power, derives, from, the, factors, of, interdependence, between, two, entities, and, the, environment, the, use, of, power, need, not, involve, force, or, the, threat, of, force, coercion, an, example, of, using, power, without, oppression, is, the, concept, soft, power, as, compared, to, hard, power, much, of, the, recent, sociological, debate, about, power, revolves, around, the, issue, of, its, means, to, enable, in, other, words, power, as, a, means, to, make, social, actions, possible, as, much, as, it, may, constrain, or, prevent, them, abusive, power, and, control, or, controlling, behaviour, or, coercive, control, involve, the, ways, in, which, abusers, gain, and, maintain, power, and, control, over, victims, for, abusive, purposes, such, as, psychological, physical, sexual, or, financial, abuse, such, abuse, can, have, various, causes, such, as, personal, gain, personal, gratification, psychological, projection, devaluation, envy, or, because, some, abusers, enjoy, exercising, power, and, control, controlling, abusers, may, use, multiple, tactics, to, exert, power, and, control, over, their, victims, the, tactics, themselves, are, psychologically, and, sometimes, physically, abusive, control, may, be, helped, through, economic, abuse, thus, limiting, the, victim, s, actions, as, they, may, then, lack, the, necessary, resources, to, resist, the, abuse, abusers, aim, to, control, and, intimidate, victims, or, to, influence, them, to, feel, that, they, do, not, have, an, equal, voice, in, the, relationship, manipulators, and, abusers, may, control, their, victims, with, a, range, of, tactics, including, the, vulnerabilities, of, the, victim, are, exploited, with, those, who, are, particularly, vulnerable, being, most, often, selected, as, targets, traumatic, bonding, can, occur, between, the, abuser, and, victim, as, the, result, of, ongoing, cycles, of, abuse, in, which, the, intermittent, reinforcement, of, reward, and, punishment, fosters, powerful, emotional, bonds, that, are, resistant, to, change, as, well, as, a, climate, of, fear, an, attempt, may, be, made, to, normalise, legitimise, rationalise, deny, or, minimise, the, abusive, behaviour, or, to, blame, the, victim, for, it, isolation, gaslighting, mind, games, lying, disinformation, propaganda, destabilisation, brainwashing, and, divide, and, rule, are, other, strategies, that, are, often, used, the, victim, may, be, plied, with, alcohol, or, drugs, or, deprived, of, sleep, to, help, disorientate, them, certain, personality, types, feel, particularly, compelled, to, control, other, people, in, everyday, situations, people, use, a, variety, of, power, tactics, to, push, or, prompt, other, people, into, particular, actions, many, examples, exist, of, common, power, tactics, employed, every, day, some, of, these, tactics, include, bullying, collaboration, complaining, criticizing, demanding, disengaging, evading, humor, inspiring, manipulating, negotiating, socializing, and, supplicating, one, can, classify, such, power, tactics, along, three, different, dimensions, people, tend, to, vary, in, their, use, of, power, tactics, with, different, types, of, people, opting, for, different, tactics, for, instance, interpersonally, oriented, people, tend, to, use, soft, and, rational, tactics, moreover, extroverts, use, a, greater, variety, of, power, tactics, than, do, introverts, people, will, also, choose, different, tactics, based, on, the, group, situation, and, based, on, whom, they, wish, to, influence, people, also, tend, to, shift, from, soft, to, hard, tactics, when, they, face, resistance, because, power, operates, both, relationally, and, reciprocally, sociologists, speak, of, the, balance, of, power, between, parties, to, a, relationship, all, parties, to, all, relationships, have, some, power, the, sociological, examination, of, power, concerns, itself, with, discovering, and, describing, the, relative, strengths, equal, or, unequal, stable, or, subject, to, periodic, change, sociologists, usually, analyse, relationships, in, which, the, parties, have, relatively, equal, or, nearly, equal, power, in, terms, of, constraint, rather, than, of, power, in, this, context, power, has, a, connotation, of, unilateralism, if, this, were, not, so, then, all, relationships, could, be, described, in, terms, of, power, and, its, meaning, would, be, lost, given, that, power, is, not, innate, and, can, be, granted, to, others, to, acquire, power, one, must, possess, or, control, a, form, of, power, currency, in, authoritarian, regimes, political, power, is, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, a, single, leader, or, a, small, group, of, leaders, who, exercise, almost, complete, control, over, the, government, and, its, institutions, because, some, authoritarian, leaders, are, not, elected, by, a, majority, their, main, threat, is, that, posed, by, the, masses, they, often, maintain, their, power, through, political, control, tactics, like, although, several, regimes, follow, these, general, forms, of, control, different, authoritarian, sub, regime, types, rely, on, different, political, control, tactics, power, changes, those, in, the, position, of, power, and, those, who, are, targets, of, that, power, developed, by, d, keltner, and, colleagues, approach, inhibition, theory, assumes, that, having, power, and, using, power, alters, psychological, states, of, individuals, the, theory, is, based, on, the, notion, that, most, organisms, react, to, environmental, events, in, two, common, ways, the, reaction, of, approach, is, associated, with, action, self, promotion, seeking, rewards, increased, energy, and, movement, inhibition, on, the, contrary, is, associated, with, self, protection, avoiding, threats, or, danger, vigilance, loss, of, motivation, and, an, overall, reduction, in, activity, overall, approach, inhibition, theory, holds, that, power, promotes, approach, tendencies, while, a, reduction, in, power, promotes, inhibition, tendencies, a, number, of, studies, demonstrate, that, harsh, power, tactics, e, g, punishment, both, personal, and, impersonal, rule, based, sanctions, and, non, personal, rewards, are, less, effective, than, soft, tactics, expert, power, referent, power, and, personal, rewards, it, is, probably, because, harsh, tactics, generate, hostility, depression, fear, and, anger, while, soft, tactics, are, often, reciprocated, with, cooperation, coercive, and, reward, power, can, also, lead, group, members, to, lose, interest, in, their, work, while, instilling, a, feeling, of, autonomy, in, one, s, subordinates, can, sustain, their, interest, in, work, and, maintain, high, productivity, even, in, the, absence, of, monitoring, coercive, influence, creates, conflict, that, can, disrupt, entire, group, functioning, when, disobedient, group, members, are, severely, reprimanded, the, rest, of, the, group, may, become, more, disruptive, and, uninterested, in, their, work, leading, to, negative, and, inappropriate, activities, spreading, from, one, troubled, member, to, the, rest, of, the, group, this, effect, is, called, disruptive, contagion, or, ripple, effect, and, it, is, strongly, manifested, when, reprimanded, member, has, a, high, status, within, a, group, and, authority, s, requests, are, vague, and, ambiguous, coercive, influence, can, be, tolerated, when, the, group, is, successful, the, leader, is, trusted, and, the, use, of, coercive, tactics, is, justified, by, group, norms, furthermore, coercive, methods, are, more, effective, when, applied, frequently, and, consistently, to, punish, prohibited, actions, however, in, some, cases, group, members, chose, to, resist, the, authority, s, influence, when, low, power, group, members, have, a, feeling, of, shared, identity, they, are, more, likely, to, form, a, revolutionary, coalition, a, subgroup, formed, within, a, larger, group, that, seeks, to, disrupt, and, oppose, the, group, s, authority, structure, group, members, are, more, likely, to, form, a, revolutionary, coalition, and, resist, an, authority, when, authority, lacks, referent, power, uses, coercive, methods, and, asks, group, members, to, carry, out, unpleasant, assignments, it, is, because, these, conditions, create, reactance, individuals, strive, to, reassert, their, sense, of, freedom, by, affirming, their, agency, for, their, own, choices, and, consequences, herbert, kelman, identified, three, basic, step, like, reactions, that, people, display, in, response, to, coercive, influence, compliance, identification, and, internalization, this, theory, explains, how, groups, convert, hesitant, recruits, into, zealous, followers, over, time, at, the, stage, of, compliance, group, members, comply, with, authority, s, demands, but, personally, do, not, agree, with, them, if, authority, does, not, monitor, the, members, they, will, probably, not, obey, identification, occurs, when, the, target, of, the, influence, admires, and, therefore, imitates, the, authority, mimics, authority, s, actions, values, characteristics, and, takes, on, behaviours, of, the, person, with, power, if, prolonged, and, continuous, identification, can, lead, to, the, final, stage, internalization, when, internalization, occurs, individual, adopts, the, induced, behaviour, because, it, is, congruent, with, his, her, value, system, at, this, stage, group, members, no, longer, carry, out, authority, orders, but, perform, actions, that, are, congruent, with, their, personal, beliefs, and, opinions, extreme, obedience, often, requires, internalization, power, literacy, refers, to, how, one, perceives, power, how, it, is, formed, and, accumulates, and, the, structures, that, support, it, and, who, is, in, control, of, it, education, can, be, helpful, for, heightening, power, literacy, in, a, 2014, ted, talk, eric, liu, notes, that, we, don, t, like, to, talk, about, power, as, we, find, it, scary, and, somehow, evil, with, it, having, a, negative, moral, valence, and, states, that, the, pervasiveness, of, power, illiteracy, causes, a, concentration, of, knowledge, understanding, and, clout, joe, l, kincheloe, describes, a, cyber, literacy, of, power, that, is, concerned, with, the, forces, that, shape, knowledge, production, and, the, construction, and, transmission, of, meaning, being, more, about, engaging, knowledge, than, mastering, information, and, a, cyber, power, literacy, that, is, focused, on, transformative, knowledge, production, and, new, modes, of, accountability
