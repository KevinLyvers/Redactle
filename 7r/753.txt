self, esteem, is, confidence, in, one, s, own, worth, abilities, or, morals, self, esteem, encompasses, beliefs, about, oneself, for, example, i, am, loved, i, am, worthy, as, well, as, emotional, states, such, as, triumph, despair, pride, and, shame, smith, and, mackie, define, it, by, saying, the, self, concept, is, what, we, think, about, the, self, self, esteem, is, the, positive, or, negative, evaluations, of, the, self, as, in, how, we, feel, about, it, see, self, the, construct, of, self, esteem, has, been, shown, to, be, a, desirable, one, in, psychology, as, it, is, associated, with, a, variety, of, positive, outcomes, such, as, academic, achievement, relationship, satisfaction, happiness, and, lower, rates, of, criminal, behavior, the, benefits, of, high, self, esteem, are, thought, to, include, improved, mental, and, physical, health, and, less, anti, social, behavior, while, drawbacks, of, low, self, esteem, have, been, found, to, be, anxiety, loneliness, and, increased, vulnerability, to, substance, abuse, self, esteem, can, apply, to, a, specific, attribute, or, globally, psychologists, usually, regard, self, esteem, as, an, enduring, personality, characteristic, trait, self, esteem, though, normal, short, term, variations, state, self, esteem, also, exist, synonyms, or, near, synonyms, of, self, esteem, include, self, worth, self, regard, self, respect, and, self, integrity, the, concept, of, self, esteem, has, its, origins, in, the, 18th, century, first, expressed, in, the, writings, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, thinker, david, hume, hume, posits, that, it, is, important, to, value, and, think, well, of, oneself, because, it, serves, a, motivational, function, that, enables, people, to, explore, their, full, potential, the, identification, of, self, esteem, as, a, distinct, psychological, construct, has, its, origins, in, the, work, of, philosopher, and, psychologist, william, james, james, identified, multiple, dimensions, of, the, self, with, two, levels, of, hierarchy, processes, of, knowing, called, the, i, self, and, the, resulting, knowledge, about, the, self, the, me, self, the, observation, about, the, self, and, storage, of, those, observations, by, the, i, self, creates, three, types, of, knowledge, which, collectively, account, for, the, me, self, according, to, james, these, are, the, material, self, social, self, and, spiritual, self, the, social, self, comes, closest, to, self, esteem, comprising, all, characteristics, recognized, by, others, the, material, self, consists, of, representations, of, the, body, and, possessions, and, the, spiritual, self, of, descriptive, representations, and, evaluative, dispositions, regarding, the, self, this, view, of, self, esteem, as, the, collection, of, an, individual, s, attitudes, toward, itself, remains, today, in, the, mid, 1960s, social, psychologist, morris, rosenberg, defined, self, esteem, as, a, feeling, of, self, worth, and, developed, the, rosenberg, self, esteem, scale, rses, which, became, the, most, widely, used, scale, to, measure, self, esteem, in, the, social, sciences, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, behaviorist, movement, shunned, introspective, study, of, mental, processes, emotions, and, feelings, replacing, introspection, with, objective, study, through, experiments, on, behaviors, observed, in, relation, with, the, environment, behaviorism, viewed, the, human, being, as, an, animal, subject, to, reinforcements, and, suggested, making, psychology, an, experimental, science, similar, to, chemistry, or, biology, consequently, clinical, trials, on, self, esteem, were, overlooked, since, behaviorists, considered, the, idea, less, amenable, to, rigorous, measurement, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, rise, of, phenomenology, and, humanistic, psychology, led, to, a, renewed, interest, in, self, esteem, as, a, treatment, for, psychological, disorders, such, as, depression, anxiety, and, personality, disorders, psychologists, started, to, consider, the, relationship, between, psychotherapy, and, the, personal, satisfaction, of, people, with, high, self, esteem, as, useful, to, the, field, this, led, to, new, elements, being, introduced, to, the, concept, of, self, esteem, including, the, reasons, why, people, tend, to, feel, less, worthy, and, why, people, become, discouraged, or, unable, to, meet, challenges, by, themselves, in, 1992, the, political, scientist, francis, fukuyama, associated, self, esteem, with, what, plato, called, thymos, the, spiritedness, part, of, the, platonic, soul, from, 1997, the, core, self, evaluations, approach, included, self, esteem, as, one, of, four, dimensions, that, comprise, one, s, fundamental, appraisal, of, oneself, along, with, locus, of, control, neuroticism, and, self, efficacy, the, concept, of, core, self, evaluations, has, since, proven, to, have, the, ability, to, predict, job, satisfaction, and, job, performance, self, esteem, may, be, essential, to, self, evaluation, the, importance, of, self, esteem, gained, endorsement, from, some, government, and, non, government, groups, starting, around, the, 1970s, such, that, one, can, speak, of, a, self, esteem, movement, this, movement, provides, evidence, that, psychological, research, can, shape, public, policy, this, has, expanded, to, recent, years, such, as, 2023, where, psychologists, are, planning, to, re, invent, the, approach, to, research, treatments, and, therapy, the, new, approach, emphasizes, population, health, where, psychological, researchers, have, prioritized, one, one, therapy, in, regards, to, analyzing, social, emotional, conflict, like, low, self, esteem, the, underlying, idea, of, the, movement, was, that, low, self, esteem, was, the, root, of, problems, for, individuals, making, it, the, root, of, societal, problems, and, dysfunctions, a, leading, figure, of, the, movement, psychologist, nathaniel, branden, stated, cannot, think, of, a, single, psychological, problem, from, anxiety, and, depression, to, fear, of, intimacy, or, of, success, to, spouse, battery, or, child, molestation, that, is, not, traced, back, to, the, problem, of, low, self, esteem, 3, it, was, once, thought, that, self, esteem, was, primarily, a, feature, of, western, individualistic, societies, as, it, was, not, observed, in, collectivist, cultures, such, as, japan, concern, about, low, self, esteem, and, its, many, presumed, negative, consequences, led, california, assemblyman, john, vasconcellos, to, work, to, set, up, and, fund, the, task, force, on, self, esteem, and, personal, and, social, responsibility, in, california, in, 1986, vasconcellos, argued, that, this, task, force, could, combat, many, of, the, state, s, problems, from, crime, and, teen, pregnancy, to, school, underachievement, and, pollution, he, compared, increasing, self, esteem, to, giving, out, a, vaccine, for, a, disease, it, could, help, protect, people, from, being, overwhelmed, by, life, s, challenges, the, task, force, set, up, committees, in, many, california, counties, and, formed, a, committee, of, scholars, to, review, the, available, literature, on, self, esteem, this, committee, found, very, small, associations, between, low, self, esteem, and, its, assumed, consequences, ultimately, showing, that, low, self, esteem, was, not, the, root, of, all, societal, problems, and, not, as, important, as, the, committee, had, originally, thought, however, the, authors, of, the, paper, that, summarized, the, review, of, the, literature, still, believed, that, self, esteem, is, an, independent, variable, that, affects, major, social, problems, the, task, force, disbanded, in, 1995, and, the, national, council, for, self, esteem, and, later, the, national, association, for, self, esteem, nase, was, established, taking, on, the, task, force, s, mission, vasconcellos, and, jack, canfield, were, members, of, its, advisory, board, in, 2003, and, members, of, its, masters, coalition, included, anthony, robbins, bernie, siegel, and, gloria, steinem, many, early, theories, suggested, that, self, esteem, is, a, basic, human, need, or, motivation, american, psychologist, abraham, maslow, included, self, esteem, in, his, hierarchy, of, human, needs, he, described, two, different, forms, of, esteem, the, need, for, respect, from, others, in, the, form, of, recognition, success, and, admiration, and, the, need, for, self, respect, in, the, form, of, self, love, self, confidence, skill, or, aptitude, respect, from, others, was, believed, to, be, more, fragile, and, easily, lost, than, inner, self, esteem, according, to, maslow, without, the, fulfillment, of, the, self, esteem, need, individuals, will, be, driven, to, seek, it, and, unable, to, grow, and, obtain, self, actualization, maslow, also, states, that, the, healthiest, expression, of, self, esteem, is, the, one, which, manifests, in, the, respect, we, deserve, for, others, more, than, renown, fame, and, flattery, modern, theories, of, self, esteem, explore, the, reasons, humans, are, motivated, to, maintain, a, high, regard, for, themselves, sociometer, theory, maintains, that, self, esteem, evolved, to, check, one, s, level, of, status, and, acceptance, in, one, s, social, group, according, to, terror, management, theory, self, esteem, serves, a, protective, function, and, reduces, anxiety, about, life, and, death, carl, rogers, 1902, 1987, an, advocate, of, humanistic, psychology, theorized, the, origin, of, many, people, s, problems, to, be, that, they, despise, themselves, and, consider, themselves, worthless, and, incapable, of, being, loved, this, is, why, rogers, believed, in, the, importance, of, giving, unconditional, acceptance, to, a, client, and, when, this, was, done, it, could, improve, the, client, s, self, esteem, in, his, therapy, sessions, with, clients, he, offered, positive, regard, no, matter, what, indeed, the, concept, of, self, esteem, is, approached, since, then, in, humanistic, psychology, as, an, inalienable, right, for, every, person, summarized, in, the, following, sentence, every, human, being, with, no, exception, for, the, mere, fact, to, be, it, is, worthy, of, unconditional, respect, of, everybody, else, he, deserves, to, esteem, himself, and, to, be, esteemed, self, esteem, is, typically, assessed, using, self, report, inventories, one, of, the, most, widely, used, instruments, the, rosenberg, self, esteem, scale, rses, is, a, 10, item, self, esteem, scale, score, that, requires, participants, to, indicate, their, level, of, agreement, with, a, series, of, statements, about, themselves, an, alternative, measure, the, coopersmith, inventory, uses, a, 50, question, battery, over, a, variety, of, topics, and, asks, subjects, whether, they, rate, someone, as, similar, or, dissimilar, to, themselves, if, a, subject, s, answers, demonstrate, solid, self, regard, the, scale, regards, them, as, well, adjusted, if, those, answers, reveal, some, inner, shame, it, considers, them, to, be, prone, to, social, deviance, implicit, measures, of, self, esteem, began, to, be, used, in, the, 1980s, these, rely, on, indirect, measures, of, cognitive, processing, thought, to, be, linked, to, implicit, self, esteem, including, the, name, letter, task, or, initial, preference, task, and, the, implicit, association, task, such, indirect, measures, are, designed, to, reduce, awareness, of, the, process, of, assessment, when, using, them, to, assess, implicit, self, esteem, psychologists, apply, self, relevant, stimuli, to, the, participant, and, then, measure, how, quickly, a, person, identifies, positive, or, negative, stimuli, for, example, if, a, woman, was, given, the, self, relevant, stimuli, of, female, and, mother, psychologists, would, measure, how, quickly, she, identified, the, negative, word, evil, or, the, positive, word, kind, experiences, in, a, person, s, life, are, a, major, source, of, how, self, esteem, develops, in, the, early, years, of, a, child, s, life, parents, have, a, significant, influence, on, self, esteem, and, can, be, considered, the, main, source, of, positive, and, negative, experiences, a, child, will, have, unconditional, love, from, parents, helps, a, child, develop, a, stable, sense, of, being, cared, for, and, respected, these, feelings, translate, into, later, effects, on, self, esteem, as, the, child, grows, older, students, in, elementary, school, who, have, high, self, esteem, tend, to, have, authoritative, parents, who, are, caring, supportive, adults, who, set, clear, standards, for, their, child, and, allow, them, to, voice, their, opinion, in, decision, making, although, studies, thus, far, have, reported, only, a, correlation, of, warm, supportive, parenting, styles, mainly, authoritative, and, permissive, with, children, having, high, self, esteem, these, parenting, styles, could, easily, be, thought, of, as, having, some, causal, effect, in, self, esteem, development, childhood, experiences, that, contribute, to, healthy, self, esteem, include, being, listened, to, being, spoken, to, respectfully, receiving, appropriate, attention, and, affection, and, having, accomplishments, recognized, and, mistakes, or, failures, acknowledged, and, accepted, experiences, that, contribute, to, low, self, esteem, include, being, harshly, criticized, being, physically, sexually, or, emotionally, abused, being, ignored, ridiculed, or, teased, or, being, expected, to, be, perfect, all, the, time, during, school, aged, years, academic, achievement, is, a, significant, contributor, to, self, esteem, development, consistently, achieving, success, or, consistently, failing, will, have, a, strong, effect, on, students, individual, self, esteem, however, students, can, also, experience, low, self, esteem, while, in, school, for, example, they, may, not, have, academic, achievements, or, they, live, in, a, troubled, environment, outside, of, school, issues, like, the, ones, previously, stated, can, cause, adolescents, to, doubt, themselves, social, experiences, are, another, important, contributor, to, self, esteem, as, children, go, through, school, they, begin, to, understand, and, recognize, differences, between, themselves, and, their, classmates, using, social, comparisons, children, assess, whether, they, did, better, or, worse, than, classmates, in, different, activities, these, comparisons, play, an, important, role, in, shaping, the, child, s, self, esteem, and, influence, the, positive, or, negative, feelings, they, have, about, themselves, as, children, go, through, adolescence, peer, influence, becomes, much, more, important, adolescents, make, appraisals, of, themselves, based, on, their, relationships, with, close, friends, successful, relationships, among, friends, are, very, important, to, the, development, of, high, self, esteem, for, children, social, acceptance, brings, about, confidence, and, produces, high, self, esteem, whereas, rejection, from, peers, and, loneliness, brings, about, self, doubts, and, produces, low, self, esteem, self, esteem, tends, to, increase, during, adolescence, and, young, adulthood, reaching, a, peak, in, middle, age, a, decrease, is, seen, from, middle, age, to, old, age, with, varying, findings, on, whether, it, is, a, small, or, large, decrease, reasons, for, the, variability, could, be, because, of, differences, in, health, cognitive, ability, and, socioeconomic, status, in, old, age, no, differences, have, been, found, between, males, and, females, in, their, development, of, self, esteem, multiple, cohort, studies, show, that, there, is, not, a, difference, in, the, life, span, trajectory, of, self, esteem, between, generations, due, to, societal, changes, such, as, grade, inflation, in, education, or, the, presence, of, social, media, high, levels, of, mastery, low, risk, taking, and, better, health, are, ways, to, predict, higher, self, esteem, in, terms, of, personality, emotionally, stable, extroverted, and, conscientious, individuals, experience, higher, self, esteem, these, predictors, have, shown, us, that, self, esteem, has, trait, like, qualities, by, remaining, stable, over, time, like, personality, and, intelligence, however, this, does, not, mean, it, can, not, be, changed, hispanic, adolescents, have, a, slightly, lower, self, esteem, than, their, black, and, white, peers, but, then, slightly, higher, levels, by, age, 30, african, americans, have, a, sharper, increase, in, self, esteem, in, adolescence, and, young, adulthood, compared, to, whites, however, during, old, age, they, experience, a, more, rapid, decline, in, self, esteem, shame, can, be, a, contributor, to, those, with, problems, of, low, self, esteem, feelings, of, shame, usually, occur, because, of, a, situation, where, the, social, self, is, devalued, such, as, a, socially, evaluated, poor, performance, poor, performance, leads, to, a, decrease, in, social, self, esteem, and, an, increase, in, shame, indicating, a, threat, to, the, social, self, this, increase, in, shame, can, be, helped, with, self, compassion, there, are, three, levels, of, self, evaluation, development, in, relation, to, the, real, self, ideal, self, and, the, dreaded, self, the, real, ideal, and, dreaded, selves, develop, in, children, in, a, sequential, pattern, on, cognitive, levels, this, development, brings, with, it, increasingly, complicated, and, encompassing, moral, demands, this, level, is, where, individuals, self, esteems, can, suffer, because, they, do, not, feel, as, though, they, are, living, up, to, certain, expectations, this, feeling, will, moderately, affect, one, s, self, esteem, with, an, even, larger, effect, seen, when, individuals, believe, they, are, becoming, their, dreaded, selves, people, with, a, healthy, level, of, self, esteem, some, people, have, a, secure, high, self, esteem, and, can, confidently, maintain, positive, self, views, without, relying, on, external, reassurance, however, others, have, defensive, high, self, esteem, and, while, they, also, report, positive, self, views, on, the, rosenberg, scale, these, views, are, fragile, and, easily, threatened, by, criticism, defensive, high, self, esteem, individuals, internalize, subconscious, self, doubts, and, insecurities, causing, them, to, react, very, negatively, to, any, criticism, they, may, receive, there, is, a, need, for, constant, positive, feedback, from, others, for, these, individuals, to, maintain, their, feelings, of, self, worth, the, necessity, of, repeated, praise, can, be, associated, with, boastful, arrogant, behavior, or, sometimes, even, aggressive, and, hostile, feelings, toward, anyone, who, questions, the, individual, s, self, worth, an, example, of, threatened, egotism, the, journal, of, educational, psychology, conducted, a, study, in, which, they, used, a, sample, of, 383, malaysian, undergraduates, participating, in, work, integrated, learning, wil, programs, across, five, public, universities, to, test, the, relationship, between, self, esteem, and, other, psychological, attributes, such, as, self, efficacy, and, self, confidence, the, results, demonstrated, that, self, esteem, has, a, positive, and, significant, relationship, with, self, confidence, and, self, efficacy, since, students, with, higher, self, esteem, had, better, performances, at, university, than, those, with, lower, self, esteem, it, was, concluded, that, higher, education, institutions, and, employers, should, emphasize, the, importance, of, undergraduates, self, esteem, development, implicit, self, esteem, refers, to, a, person, s, disposition, to, evaluate, themselves, positively, or, negatively, in, a, spontaneous, automatic, or, unconscious, manner, it, contrasts, with, explicit, self, esteem, which, entails, more, conscious, and, reflective, self, evaluation, both, explicit, self, esteem, and, implicit, self, esteem, are, theoretically, subtypes, of, self, esteem, proper, however, the, validity, of, implicit, self, esteem, as, a, construct, is, highly, questionable, given, not, only, its, weak, or, nonexistent, correlation, with, explicit, self, esteem, and, informant, ratings, of, self, esteem, but, also, the, failure, of, multiple, measures, of, implicit, self, esteem, to, correlate, with, each, other, currently, there, is, little, scientific, evidence, that, self, esteem, can, be, reliably, or, validly, measured, through, implicit, means, narcissism, is, a, disposition, people, may, have, that, represents, an, excessive, love, for, one, s, self, it, is, characterized, by, an, inflated, view, of, self, worth, individuals, who, score, high, on, narcissism, measures, robert, raskin, s, narcissistic, personality, inventory, would, likely, respond, true, to, such, prompt, statements, as, if, i, ruled, the, world, it, would, be, a, much, better, place, there, is, only, a, moderate, correlation, between, narcissism, and, self, esteem, that, is, to, say, that, an, individual, can, have, high, self, esteem, but, low, narcissism, or, can, be, a, conceited, obnoxious, person, and, score, high, self, esteem, and, high, narcissism, however, when, correlation, analysis, is, restricted, to, the, sense, of, superiority, or, self, admiration, aspects, of, narcissism, correlations, between, narcissism, and, self, esteem, become, strong, usually, at, or, around, r, 50, but, sometimes, up, to, 86, moreover, self, esteem, is, positively, correlated, with, a, sense, of, superiority, even, when, controlling, for, overall, narcissism, narcissism, is, not, only, defined, by, inflated, self, esteem, but, also, by, characteristics, such, as, entitlement, exploitativeness, and, dominance, additionally, while, positive, self, image, is, a, shared, characteristic, of, narcissism, and, self, esteem, narcissistic, self, appraisals, are, exaggerated, whereas, in, non, narcissistic, self, esteem, positive, views, of, the, self, compared, with, others, are, relatively, modest, thus, while, sharing, positive, self, regard, as, a, main, feature, and, while, narcissism, is, defined, by, high, self, esteem, the, two, constructs, are, not, interchangeable, threatened, egotism, is, a, phenomenon, in, which, narcissists, respond, to, criticism, with, hostility, and, aggression, as, it, threatens, their, sense, of, self, worth, low, self, esteem, can, result, from, various, factors, including, genetic, factors, physical, appearance, or, weight, mental, health, issues, socioeconomic, status, significant, emotional, experiences, social, stigma, peer, pressure, or, bullying, a, person, with, low, self, esteem, may, show, some, of, the, following, characteristics, individuals, with, low, self, esteem, tend, to, be, critical, of, themselves, some, depend, on, the, approval, and, praise, of, others, when, evaluating, self, worth, others, may, measure, their, likability, in, terms, of, successes, others, will, accept, themselves, if, they, succeed, but, will, not, if, they, fail, people, with, chronic, low, self, esteem, are, at, a, higher, risk, for, experiencing, psychotic, disorders, and, this, behavior, is, closely, linked, to, forming, psychotic, symptoms, as, well, metacognitive, therapy, emdr, technique, mindfulness, based, cognitive, therapy, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, and, trait, and, construct, therapies, have, been, shown, to, improve, the, patient, s, self, esteem, this, classification, proposed, by, martin, ross, distinguishes, three, states, of, self, esteem, compared, to, the, feats, triumphs, honors, virtues, and, the, anti, feats, defeats, embarrassment, shame, etc, of, the, individuals, the, individual, does, not, regard, themselves, as, valuable, or, lovable, they, may, be, overwhelmed, by, defeat, or, shame, or, see, themselves, as, such, and, they, name, their, anti, feat, for, example, if, they, consider, that, being, over, a, certain, age, is, an, anti, feat, they, define, themselves, with, the, name, of, their, anti, feat, and, say, i, am, old, they, express, actions, and, feelings, such, as, pity, insulting, themselves, and, they, may, become, paralyzed, by, their, sadness, the, individual, has, a, generally, positive, self, image, however, their, self, esteem, is, also, vulnerable, to, the, perceived, risk, of, an, imminent, anti, feat, such, as, defeat, embarrassment, shame, discredit, consequently, they, are, often, nervous, and, regularly, use, defense, mechanisms, a, typical, protection, mechanism, of, those, with, vulnerable, self, esteem, may, consist, in, avoiding, decision, making, although, such, individuals, may, outwardly, exhibit, great, self, confidence, the, underlying, reality, may, be, just, the, opposite, the, apparent, self, confidence, is, indicative, of, their, heightened, fear, of, anti, feats, and, the, fragility, of, their, self, esteem, they, may, also, try, to, blame, others, to, protect, their, self, image, from, situations, that, would, threaten, it, they, may, employ, defense, mechanisms, including, attempting, to, lose, at, games, and, other, competitions, in, order, to, protect, their, self, image, by, publicly, dissociating, themselves, from, a, need, to, win, and, asserting, an, independence, from, social, acceptance, which, they, may, deeply, desire, in, this, deep, fear, of, being, unaccepted, by, an, individual, s, peers, they, make, poor, life, choices, by, making, risky, decisions, people, with, strong, self, esteem, have, a, positive, self, image, and, enough, strength, so, that, anti, feats, do, not, subdue, their, self, esteem, they, have, less, fear, of, failure, these, individuals, appear, humble, cheerful, and, this, shows, a, certain, strength, not, to, boast, about, feats, and, not, to, be, afraid, of, anti, feats, they, are, capable, of, fighting, with, all, their, might, to, achieve, their, goals, because, if, things, go, wrong, their, self, esteem, will, not, be, affected, they, can, acknowledge, their, own, mistakes, precisely, because, their, self, image, is, strong, and, this, acknowledgment, will, not, impair, or, affect, their, self, image, they, live, with, less, fear, of, losing, social, prestige, and, with, more, happiness, and, general, well, being, however, no, type, of, self, esteem, is, indestructible, and, due, to, certain, situations, or, circumstances, in, life, one, can, fall, from, this, level, into, any, other, state, of, self, esteem, a, distinction, is, made, between, contingent, or, conditional, and, non, contingent, or, unconditional, self, esteem, contingent, self, esteem, is, derived, from, external, sources, such, as, what, others, say, one, s, success, or, failure, one, s, competence, or, relationship, contingent, self, esteem, therefore, contingent, self, esteem, is, marked, by, instability, unreliability, and, vulnerability, persons, lacking, a, non, contingent, self, esteem, are, predisposed, to, an, incessant, pursuit, of, self, value, however, because, the, pursuit, of, contingent, self, esteem, is, based, on, receiving, approval, it, is, doomed, to, fail, as, no, one, receives, constant, approval, and, disapproval, often, evokes, depression, furthermore, fear, of, disapproval, inhibits, activities, in, which, failure, is, possible, the, courage, to, be, is, the, courage, to, accept, oneself, in, spite, of, being, unacceptable, this, is, the, pauline, lutheran, doctrine, of, justification, by, faith, paul, tillich, non, contingent, self, esteem, is, described, as, true, stable, and, solid, it, springs, from, a, belief, that, one, is, acceptable, period, acceptable,

comprise, self, evaluations, in, social, emotional, body, related, school, performance, related, and, creative, artistic, domains, they, have, been, found, to, be, predictive, of, outcomes, related,

relationships, with, others, when, people, have, a, positive, view, of, themselves, they, are, more, likely, to, treat, others, with, respect, compassion, and, kindness, this, creates, the,

the, world, health, organization, recommends, in, preventing, suicide, published, in, 2000, that, strengthening, students, self, esteem, is, important, to, protect, children, and, adolescents, against, mental, distress, and, despondency, enabling, them, to, cope, adequately, with, difficult, and, stressful, life, situations, not, only, does, higher, self, esteem, increase, happiness, but, it, is, also, associated, with, improved, stress, coping, and, increased, willingness, to, take, on, challenging, tasks, in, contrast, a, study, examined, the, impact, of, boosting, self, esteem, it, found, that, high, self, esteem, does, offer, some, benefits, but, they, are, limited, it, is, often, a, result, rather, than, a, cause, of, success, the, researchers, also, found, that, efforts, to, boost, self, esteem, may, not, consistently, lead, to, improved, performance, and, that, self, esteem, s, influence, on, life, outcomes, is, modest, except, for, a, temporary, increase, in, positive, self, image, awareness, from, the, late, 1970s, to, the, early, 1990s, many, americans, assumed, as, a, matter, of, course, that, students, self, esteem, acted, as, a, critical, factor, in, the, grades, that, they, earned, in, school, in, their, relationships, with, their, peers, and, in, their, later, success, in, life, under, this, assumption, some, american, groups, created, programs, which, aimed, to, increase, the, self, esteem, of, students, until, the, 1990s, little, peer, reviewed, and, controlled, research, took, place, on, this, topic, peer, reviewed, research, undertaken, since, then, has, not, validated, previous, assumptions, recent, research, indicates, that, inflating, students, self, esteems, in, and, of, itself, has, no, positive, effect, on, grades, roy, baumeister, has, shown, that, inflating, self, esteem, by, itself, can, actually, decrease, grades, the, relationship, involving, self, esteem, and, academic, results, does, not, signify, that, high, self, esteem, contributes, to, high, academic, results, it, simply, means, that, high, self, esteem, may, be, accomplished, as, a, result, of, high, academic, performance, due, to, the, other, variables, of, social, interactions, and, life, events, affecting, this, performance, attempts, by, pro, esteem, advocates, to, encourage, self, pride, in, students, solely, by, reason, of, their,

correlation, between, high, self, esteem, and, self, reported, happiness, but, it, is, not, yet, known, whether, this, relationship, is, causal, this, means, that, although, people, with, high, self, esteem, tend, to, report, greater, happiness, it, is, not, certain, whether, having, high, self, esteem, directly, causes, increased, happiness, the, relationship, between, self, esteem, and, life, satisfaction, is, stronger, in, individualistic, cultures, in, addition, people, with, high, self, esteem, have, been, found, to, be, more, forgiving, than, people, with, low, self, esteem, this, is, because, people, with, high, self, esteem, tend, to, have, greater, self, acceptance, and, are, more, likely, to, view, conflict, in, a, positive, light, as, an, opportunity, for, growth, and, improvement, in, contrast, people, with, low, self, esteem, may, have, a, harder, time, forgiving, others, due, to, a, sense, of, insecurity, and, self, doubt, high, self, esteem, does, not, prevent, children, from, smoking, drinking, taking, drugs, or, engaging, in, early, sex, self, esteem, has, been, associated, with, several, mental, health, conditions, including, depression, anxiety, and, eating, disorders, for, example, low, self, esteem, may, increase, the, likelihood, that, people, who, experience, dysfunctional, thoughts, will, develop, symptoms, of, depression, consequently, cognitive, treatment, of, depression, helps, with, low, self, esteem, and, vice, versa, addressing, low, self, esteem, improves, depressive, symptoms, in, contrast, high, self, esteem, may, protect, against, the, development, of, mental, health, conditions, with, research, finding, that, high, self, esteem, reduces, the, chances, of, bulimia, and, anxiety, in, research, conducted, in, 2014, by, robert, s, chavez, and, todd, f, heatherton, it, was, found, that, self, esteem, is, related, to, the, connectivity, of, the, frontostriatal, circuit, the, frontostriatal, pathway, connects, the, medial, prefrontal, cortex, which, deals, with, self, knowledge, to, the, ventral, striatum, which, deals, with, feelings, of, motivation, and, reward, stronger, anatomical, pathways, are, correlated, with, higher, long, term, self, esteem, while, stronger, functional, connectivity, is, correlated, with, higher, short, term, self, esteem, albert, ellis, an, influential, american, psychologist, argued, that, the, concept, of, self, esteem, is, actually, harmful, and, unhelpful, although, acknowledging, the, human, propensity, and, tendency, to, ego, rating, as, innate, he, has, critiqued, the, philosophy, of, self, esteem, as, unrealistic, illogical, and, self, and, socially, destructive, often, doing, more, harm, than, good, questioning, the, foundations, and, usefulness, of, generalized, ego, strength, he, has, claimed, that, self, esteem, is, based, on, arbitrary, definitional, premises, and, overgeneralized, perfectionistic, and, grandiose, thinking, acknowledging, that, rating, and, valuing, behaviors, and, characteristics, is, functional, and, even, necessary, he, sees, rating, and, valuing, human, beings, totality, and, total, selves, as, irrational, and, unethical, the, healthier, alternative, to, self, esteem, according, to, him, is, unconditional, self, acceptance, and, unconditional, other, acceptance, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, is, a, psychotherapy, based, on, this, approach, for, persons, with, low, self, esteem, any, positive, stimulus, will, temporarily, raise, self, esteem, therefore, possessions, sex, success, or, physical, appearance, will, produce, the, development, of, self, esteem, but, the, development, is, ephemeral, at, best, such, attempts, to, raise, one, s, self, esteem, by, positive, stimulus, produce, a, boom, or, bust, pattern, compliments, and, positive, feedback, produce, a, boost, but, a, bust, follows, a, lack, of, such, feedback, for, a, person, whose, self, esteem, is, contingent, success, is, not, extra, sweet, but, failure, is, extra, bitter, life, satisfaction, happiness, healthy, behavioral, practices, perceived, efficacy, and, academic, success, and, adjustment, have, been, associated, with, having, high, levels, of, self, esteem, 270, however, a, common, mistake, is, to, think, that, loving, oneself, is, necessarily, equivalent, to, narcissism, as, opposed, for, example, to, what, erik, erikson, speaks, of, as, a, post, narcissistic, love, of, the, ego, people, with, healthy, self, esteem, accept, and, love, themselves, unconditionally, acknowledging, both, virtues, and, faults, in, the, self, and, yet, in, spite, of, everything, are, able, to, continue, to, love, themselves, in, narcissists, by, contrast, an, uncertainty, about, their, own, worth, gives, rise, to, a, self, protective, but, often, totally, spurious, aura, of, grandiosity, producing, the, class, of, narcissists, or, people, with, very, high, but, insecure, self, esteem, fluctuating, with, each, new, episode, of, social, praise, or, rejection, 479, for, narcissists, regulating, their, self, esteem, is, their, constant, concern, they, use, defenses, such, as, denial, projection, self, inflation, envy, arrogance, and, aggression, impression, management, through, self, promotion, embellishment, lying, charm, and, domination, and, prefer, high, status, competitive, and, hierarchical, environments, to, support, their, unstable, fragile, and, impaired, self, esteem, narcissism, can, thus, be, seen, as, a, symptom, of, fundamentally, low, self, esteem, that, is, lack, of, love, towards, oneself, but, often, accompanied, by, an, immense, increase, in, self, esteem, based, on, the, defense, mechanism, of, denial, by, overcompensation, idealized, love, of, self, rejected, the, part, of, him, that, he, denigrates, this, destructive, little, child, within, instead, the, narcissist, emphasizes, their, virtues, in, the, presence, of, others, just, to, try, to, convince, themself, that, they, are, a, valuable, person, and, to, try, to, stop, feeling, ashamed, for, their, faults, such, people, with, unrealistically, inflated, self, views, which, may, be, especially, unstable, and, highly, vulnerable, to, negative, information, tend, to, have, poor, social, skills, 126
