humanitarianism, is, an, ideology, centered, on, the, value, of, human, life, whereby, humans, practice, benevolent, treatment, and, provide, assistance, to, other, humans, to, reduce, suffering, and, improve, the, conditions, of, humanity, for, moral, altruistic, and, emotional, reasons, one, aspect, involves, voluntary, emergency, aid, overlapping, with, human, rights, advocacy, actions, taken, by, governments, development, assistance, and, domestic, philanthropy, other, critical, issues, include, correlation, with, religious, beliefs, motivation, of, aid, between, altruism, market, affinity, social, control, imperialism, and, neo, colonialism, gender, and, class, relations, and, humanitarian, agencies, a, practitioner, is, known, as, a, humanitarian, while, humanitarianism, on, a, local, and, national, level, can, be, traced, far, back, in, history, scholars, of, international, politics, tend, to, identify, the, advent, of, global, humanitarian, impulses, to, the, 19th, century, the, creation, of, the, international, red, cross, in, 1863, is, considered, a, key, juncture, in, global, humanitarianism, the, scope, of, humanitarianism, has, expanded, over, time, alongside, shifting, perceptions, of, who, counts, as, human, and, whose, lives, are, worth, saving, scholars, have, generally, observed, that, humanitarianism, has, increased, in, scope, over, time, as, individuals, and, groups, have, expanded, their, definition, of, human, life, to, groups, beyond, their, immediate, environment, humanitarian, governance, has, become, increasingly, complex, and, institutionalized, over, time, jean, pictet, in, his, commentary, on, the, fundamental, principles, of, the, red, cross, argues, for, the, universal, characteristics, of, humanitarianism, humanitarianism, was, publicly, seen, in, the, social, reforms, of, the, late, 1800s, and, early, 1900s, following, the, economic, turmoil, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, england, many, of, the, women, in, great, britain, who, were, involved, with, feminism, during, the, 1900s, also, pushed, humanitarianism, the, atrocious, hours, and, working, conditions, of, children, and, unskilled, laborers, were, made, illegal, by, pressure, on, parliament, by, humanitarians, the, factory, act, of, 1833, and, the, factory, act, of, 1844, were, some, of, the, most, significant, humanitarian, bills, passed, in, parliament, following, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, humanitarianism, was, central, to, the, work, of, florence, nightingale, and, henry, dunant, in, emergency, response, and, in, the, latter, case, led, to, the, founding, of, the, red, cross, the, humanitarian, league, 1891, 1919, was, an, english, advocacy, group, formed, by, henry, s, salt, which, sought, to, advance, the, humanitarian, cause, various, suggestions, of, distinct, periods, of, humanitarianism, exist, drawing, either, on, geopolitical, or, socioeconomic, factors, that, determine, humanitarian, action, the, first, approach, is, exemplified, by, michael, barnett, s, proposition, to, distinguish, ages, of, imperial, humanitarianism, late, 19th, century, to, 1945, neo, humanitarianism, 1945, 1989, and, liberal, humanitarianism, post, 1990, norbert, g, tz, georgina, brewis, and, steffen, werther, are, advocates, of, the, socioeconomic, and, cultural, approach, arguing, that, there, have, been, ages, of, ad, hoc, humanitarianism, up, to, c, 1900, organized, humanitarianism, c, 1900, 1970, and, expressive, humanitarianism, since, 1970, they, suggest, we, might, currently, be, entering, a, novel, kind, of, defensive, humanitarianism, with, roots, in, the, expressive, age, with, automated, interfaces, and, with, thick, firewalls, between, donors, and, recipients, however, a, neat, separation, between, donor, and, recipient, is, conventionally, difficult, to, draw, the, employment, of, local, staff, the, active, call, for, help, from, people, in, need, and, the, surge, in, local, humanitarian, organizations, all, suggest, the, intimate, relation, between, donor, and, recipient, today, humanitarianism, is, particularly, used, to, describe, the, thinking, and, doctrines, behind, the, emergency, response, to, humanitarian, crises, in, such, cases, it, argues, for, a, humanitarian, response, based, on, humanitarian, principles, particularly, the, principle, of, humanity, nicholas, de, torrente, former, executive, director, of, m, decins, sans, fronti, res, usa, writes, the, most, important, principles, of, humanitarian, action, are, humanity, neutrality, independence, and, impartiality, which, posits, the, conviction, that, all, people, have, equal, dignity, by, virtue, of, their, being, human, based, solely, on, need, without, discrimination, among, recipients, humanitarian, organizations, must, refrain, from, taking, part, in, hostilities, or, taking, actions, that, advantage, one, side, of, the, conflict, over, another, the, action, serves, the, interests, of, political, religious, or, other, agendas, these, fundamental, principles, serve, two, essential, purposes, they, embody, humanitarian, action, s, single, minded, purpose, of, alleviating, suffering, unconditionally, and, without, any, ulterior, motive, they, also, serve, as, background, document, to, develop, operational, tools, that, help, in, obtaining, both, the, consent, of, communities, for, the, presence, and, activities, of, humanitarian, organizations, particularly, in, highly, volatile, contexts, in, 2005, a, question, was, raised, as, to, whether, wikipedia, can, be, seen, as, digital, humanitarianism, patrick, meier, used, the, term, digital, humanitarianism, to, describe, crowdmapping, for, the, 2010, haiti, earthquake, in, 2011, paul, conneally, gave, a, ted, talk, on, digital, humanitarianism, in, which, he, states, that, humanitarianism, s, origins, are, firmly, rooted, in, the, analogue, age, with, a, major, shift, coming, in, 2015, he, authored, the, book, digital, humanitarians, how, big, data, is, changing, the, face, of, humanitarian, response, vincent, fevrier, notes, that, social, media, can, benefit, the, humanitarian, sector, by, providing, information, to, give, better, situational, awareness, to, organisations, for, broad, strategic, planning, and, logistics, and, that, crisis, mapping, really, emerged, in, 2010, during, the, haiti, earthquake, with, software, and, digital, humanitarian, platforms, such, as, standby, task, force, openstreetmap, and, many, others, being, active, during, many, disasters, since, then, in, fact, the, role, of, social, media, in, digital, humanitarian, efforts, is, a, considerable, one, ten, days, after, the, 2010, earthquake, the, hope, for, haiti, now, telethon, event, was, launched, in, the, united, states, effectively, taking, over, the, mediasphere, and, reaching, hundreds, of, millions, of, households, and, viewers, it, focused, on, appealing, to, the, viewing, public, s, empathy, for, the, survivors, of, the, disaster, allowing, ordinary, citizens, to, help, in, a, collective, relief, effort, by, contributing, money, donations, to, ngos, providing, humanitarian, aid, to, earthquake, survivors, the, telethon, attracted, support, through, a, variety, of, celebrity, musical, performances, and, staged, calls, for, empathy, using, digital, social, networks, to, disseminate, its, appeal, to, the, moral, responsibility, of, the, viewer, consumers, who, are, able, to, reinforce, identification, with, a, national, identity, of, the, american, savior, through, participation, in, this, humanitarian, project, during, the, summer, of, 2010, when, open, fires, raged, across, russia, causing, many, to, die, from, smog, inhalation, the, use, of, social, media, allowed, digital, humanitarians, to, map, the, areas, in, need, of, support, this, is, because, russians, who, were, hoping, to, be, evacuated, were, posting, online, about, the, conditions, they, were, in, which, prompted, thousands, of, russian, bloggers, to, coordinate, relief, efforts, online, the, digital, humanitarian, efforts, in, russia, were, crucial, to, responding, to, the, fires, in, 2010, considering, the, russian, government, was, vastly, unprepared, to, deal, with, such, a, large, scale, disaster, within, digital, humanitarianism, big, data, has, featured, strongly, in, efforts, to, improve, digital, humanitarian, work, and, produces, a, limited, understanding, of, how, a, crisis, is, unfolding, it, has, been, argued, that, big, data, is, constitutive, of, a, social, relation, in, which, digital, humanitarians, claim, both, the, formal, humanitarian, sector, and, victims, of, crises, need, the, services, and, labor, that, can, be, provided, by, digital, humanitarians, examples, of, humanitarianism, can, include, raising, funds, for, people, in, need
