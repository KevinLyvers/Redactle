pluricentric, language, with, four, mutually, intelligible, standard, varieties, namely, serbian, croatian, bosnian, and, montenegrin, south, slavic, languages, historically, formed, a, dialect, continuum, the, turbulent, history, of, the, area, particularly, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, ottoman, empire, resulted, in, a, patchwork, of, dialectal, and, religious, differences, due, to, population, migrations, shtokavian, became, the, most, widespread, supradialect, in, the, western, balkans, intruding, westwards, into, the, area, previously, occupied, by, chakavian, and, kajkavian, bosniaks, croats, and, serbs, differ, in, religion, and, were, historically, often, part, of, different, cultural, circles, although, a, large, part, of, the, nations, have, lived, side, by, side, under, foreign, overlords, during, that, period, the, language, was, referred, to, under, a, variety, of, names, such, as, slavic, in, general, or, serbian, croatian, or, bosnian, in, particular, in, a, classicizing, manner, it, was, also, referred, to, as, illyrian, the, process, of, linguistic, standardization, of, serbo, croatian, was, originally, initiated, in, the, mid, 19th, century, vienna, literary, agreement, by, croatian, and, serbian, writers, and, philologists, decades, before, a, yugoslav, state, was, established, from, the, very, beginning, there, were, slightly, different, literary, serbian, and, croatian, standards, although, both, were, based, on, the, same, dialect, of, shtokavian, eastern, herzegovinian, in, the, 20th, century, serbo, croatian, served, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, country, of, yugoslavia, being, the, sole, official, language, in, the, kingdom, of, yugoslavia, when, it, was, called, serbo, croato, slovenian, and, afterwards, the, official, language, of, four, out, of, six, republics, of, the, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, the, breakup, of, yugoslavia, affected, language, attitudes, so, that, social, conceptions, of, the, language, separated, along, ethnic, and, political, lines, since, the, breakup, of, yugoslavia, bosnian, has, likewise, been, established, as, an, official, standard, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, and, there, is, an, ongoing, movement, to, codify, a, separate, montenegrin, standard, like, other, south, slavic, languages, serbo, croatian, has, a, simple, phonology, with, the, common, five, vowel, system, and, twenty, five, consonants, its, grammar, evolved, from, common, slavic, with, complex, inflection, preserving, seven, grammatical, cases, in, nouns, pronouns, and, adjectives, verbs, exhibit, imperfective, or, perfective, aspect, with, a, moderately, complex, tense, system, serbo, croatian, is, a, pro, drop, language, with, flexible, word, order, subject, verb,

the, orthography, is, highly, phonemic, in, all, standards, despite, many, linguistical, similarities, the, traits, that, separate, all, standardized, varieties, are, clearly, identifiable, although, these, differences, are, considered, minimal, serbo, croatian, is, typically, referred, to, by, names, of, its, standardized, varieties, serbian, croatian, bosnian, and, montenegrin, it, is, rarely, referred, to, by, names, of, its, sub, dialects, such, as, bunjevac, in, the, language, itself, it, is, typically, known, as, srpskohrvatski, serbo, croatian, hrvatskosrpski, o, croato, serbian, or, informally, na, ki, ours, throughout, the, history, of, the, south, slavs, the, vernacular, literary, and, written, languages, e, g, chakavian, kajkavian, shtokavian, of, the, various, regions, and, ethnicities, developed, and, diverged, independently, prior, to, the, 19th, century, they, were, collectively, called, illyria, slavic, slavonian, bosnian, dalmatian, serbian, or, croatian, since, the, nineteenth, century, the, term, illyrian, or, illyric, was, used, quite, often, thus, creating, confusion, with, the, illyrian, language, although, the, word, illyrian, was, used, on, a, few, occasions, before, its, widespread, usage, began, after, ljudevit, gaj, and, several, other, prominent, linguists, met, at, ljudevit, vukotinovi, s, house, to, discuss, the, issue, in, 1832, the, term, serbo, croatian, was, first, used, by, jacob, grimm, in, 1824, popularized, by, the, viennese, philologist, jernej, kopitar, in, the, following, decades, and, accepted, by, croatian, zagreb, grammarians, in, 1854, and, 1859, at, that, time, serb, and, croat, lands, were, still, part, of, the, ottoman, and, austrian, empires, officially, the, language, was, called, variously, serbo, croat, croato, serbian, serbian, and, croatian, croatian, and, serbian, serbian, or, croatian, croatian, or, serbian, unofficially, serbs, and, croats, typically, called, the, language, serbian, or, croatian, respectively, without, implying, a, distinction, between, the, two, and, again, in, independent, bosnia, and, herzegovina, bosnian, croatian, and, serbian, were, considered, to, be, three, names, of, a, single, official, language, croatian, linguist, dalibor, brozovi, advocated, the, term, serbo, croatian, as, late, as, 1988, claiming, that, in, an, analogy, with, indo, european, serbo, croatian, does, not, only, name, the, two, components, of, the, same, language, but, simply, charts, the, limits, of, the, region, in, which, it, is, spoken, and, includes, everything, between, the, limits, bosnian, and, montenegrin, today, use, of, the, term, serbo, croatian, is, controversial, due, to, the, prejudice, that, nation, and, language, must, match, it, is, still, used, for, lack, of, a, succinct, alternative, though, alternative, names, have, emerged, such, as, bosnian, croatian, serbian, bcs, which, is, often, seen, in, political, contexts, such, as, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, in, the, 9th, century, old, church, slavonic, was, adopted, as, the, language, of, the, liturgy, in, churches, serving, various, slavic, nations, this, language, was, gradually, adapted, to, non, liturgical, purposes, and, became, known, as, the, croatian, version, of, old, slavonic, the, two, variants, of, the, language, liturgical, and, non, liturgical, continued, to, be, a, part, of, the, glagolitic, service, as, late, as, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, earliest, known, croatian, church, slavonic, glagolitic, manuscripts, are, the, glagolita, clozianus, and, the, vienna, folia, from, the, 11th, century, the, beginning, of, written, serbo, croatian, can, be, traced, from, the, tenth, century, and, on, when, serbo, croatian, medieval, texts, were, written, in, four, scripts, latin, glagolitic, early, cyrillic, and, bosnian, cyrillic, bosan, ica, bosanica, serbo, croatian, competed, with, the, more, established, literary, languages, of, latin, and, old, slavonic, old, slavonic, developed, into, the, serbo, croatian, variant, of, church, slavonic, between, the, 12th, and, 16th, centuries, among, the, earliest, attestations, of, serbo, croatian, are, the, humac, tablet, dating, from, the, 10th, or, 11th, century, written, in, bosnian, cyrillic, and, glagolitic, the, plomin, tablet, dating, from, the, same, era, written, in, glagolitic, the, valun, tablet, dated, to, the, 11th, century, written, in, glagolitic, and, latin, and, the, inscription, of, upa, dubrova, ka, a, glagolitic, tablet, dated, to, the, 11th, century, the, ba, ka, tablet, from, the, late, 11th, century, was, written, in, glagolitic, it, is, a, large, stone, tablet, found, in, the, small, church, of, st, lucy, jurandvor, on, the, croatian, island, of, krk, that, contains, text, written, mostly, in, chakavian, in, the, croatian, angular, glagolitic, script, the, charter, of, ban, kulin, of, 1189, written, by, ban, kulin, of, bosnia, was, an, early, shtokavian, text, written, in, bosnian, cyrillic, the, luxurious, and, ornate, representative, texts, of, serbo, croatian, church, slavonic, belong, to, the, later, era, when, they, coexisted, with, the, serbo, croatian, vernacular, literature, the, most, notable, are, the, missal, of, duke, novak, from, the, lika, region, in, northwestern, croatia, 1368, evangel, from, reims, 1395, named, after, the, town, of, its, final, destination, hrvoje, s, missal, from, bosnia, and, split, in, dalmatia, 1404, and, the, first, printed, book, in, serbo, croatian, the, glagolitic, missale, romanum, glagolitice, 1483, during, the, 13th, century, serbo, croatian, vernacular, texts, began, to, appear, the, most, important, among, them, being, the, istrian, land, survey, of, 1275, and, the, vinodol, codex, of, 1288, both, written, in, the, chakavian, dialect, the, shtokavian, dialect, literature, based, almost, exclusively, on, chakavian, original, texts, of, religious, provenance, missals, breviaries, prayer, books, appeared, almost, a, century, later, the, most, important, purely, shtokavian, vernacular, text, is, the, vatican, croatian, prayer, book, c, 1400, both, the, language, used, in, legal, texts, and, that, used, in, glagolitic, literature, gradually, came, under, the, influence, of, the, vernacular, which, considerably, affected, its, phonological, morphological, and, lexical, systems, from, the, 14th, and, the, 15th, centuries, both, secular, and, religious, songs, at, church, festivals, were, composed, in, the, vernacular, writers, of, early, serbo, croatian, religious, poetry, za, injavci, gradually, introduced, the, vernacular, into, their, works, these, za, injavci, were, the, forerunners, of, the, rich, literary, production, of, the, 16th, century, literature, which, depending, on, the, area, was, chakavian, kajkavian, or, shtokavian, based, the, language, of, religious, poems, translations, miracle, and, morality, plays, contributed, to, the, popular, character, of, medieval, serbo, croatian, literature, one, of, the, earliest, dictionaries, also, in, the, slavic, languages, as, a, whole, was, the, bosnian, turkish, dictionary, of, 1631, authored, by, muhamed, hevaji, uskufi, and, was, written, in, the, arebica, script, in, the, mid, 19th, century, serbian, led, by, self, taught, writer, and, folklorist, vuk, stefanovi, karad, i, and, most, croatian, writers, and, linguists, represented, by, the, illyrian, movement, and, led, by, ljudevit, gaj, and, uro, dani, i, proposed, the, use, of, the, most, widespread, dialect, shtokavian, as, the, base, for, their, common, standard, language, karad, i, standardised, the, serbian, cyrillic, alphabet, and, gaj, and, dani, i, standardized, the, croatian, latin, alphabet, on, the, basis, of, vernacular, speech, phonemes, and, the, principle, of, phonological, spelling, in, 1850, serbian, and, croatian, writers, and, linguists, signed, the, vienna, literary, agreement, declaring, their, intention, to, create, a, unified, standard, thus, a, complex, bi, variant, language, appeared, which, the, serbs, officially, called, serbo, croatian, or, serbian, or, croatian, and, the, croats, croato, serbian, or, croatian, or, serbian, yet, in, practice, the, variants, of, the, conceived, common, literary, language, served, as, different, literary, variants, chiefly, differing, in, lexical, inventory, and, stylistic, devices, the, common, phrase, describing, this, situation, was, that, serbo, croatian, or, croatian, or, serbian, was, a, single, language, in, 1861, after, a, long, debate, the, croatian, sabor, put, up, several, proposed, names, to, a, vote, of, the, members, of, the, parliament, yugoslavian, was, opted, for, by, the, majority, and, legislated, as, the, official, language, of, the, triune, kingdom, the, austrian, empire, suppressing, pan, slavism, at, the, time, did, not, confirm, this, decision, and, legally, rejected, the, legislation, but, in, 1867, finally, settled, on, croatian, or, serbian, instead, during, the, austro, hungarian, occupation, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, the, language, of, all, three, nations, in, this, territory, was, declared, bosnian, until, the, death, of, administrator, von, k, llay, in, 1907, at, which, point, the, name, was, changed, to, serbo, croatian, with, unification, of, the, first, the, kingdom, of, the, serbs, croats, and, slovenes, the, approach, of, karad, i, and, the, illyrians, became, dominant, the, official, language, was, called, serbo, croato, slovenian, srpsko, hrvatsko, slovena, ki, in, the, 1921, constitution, in, 1929, the, constitution, was, suspended, and, the, country, was, renamed, the, kingdom, of, yugoslavia, while, the, official, language, of, serbo, croato, slovene, was, reinstated, in, the, 1931, constitution, in, june, 1941, the, nazi, puppet, independent, state, of, croatia, began, to, rid, the, language, of, eastern, serbian, words, and, shut, down, serbian, schools, the, totalitarian, dictatorship, introduced, a, language, law, that, promulgated, croatian, linguistic, purism, as, a, policy, that, tried, to, implement, a, complete, elimination, of, serbisms, and, internationalisms, on, january, 15, 1944, the, anti, fascist, council, of, the, people, s, liberation, of, yugoslavia, avnoj, declared, croatian, serbian, slovene, and, macedonian, to, be, equal, in, the, entire, territory, of, yugoslavia, in, 1945, the, decision, to, recognize, croatian, and, serbian, as, separate, languages, was, reversed, in, favor, of, a, single, serbo, croatian, or, croato, serbian, language, in, the, communist, dominated, second, yugoslavia, ethnic, issues, eased, to, an, extent, but, the, matter, of, language, remained, blurred, and, unresolved, in, 1954, major, serbian, and, croatian, writers, linguists, and, literary, critics, backed, by, matica, srpska, and, matica, hrvatska, signed, the, novi, sad, agreement, which, in, its, first, conclusion, stated, serbs, croats, and, montenegrins, share, a, single, language, with, two, equal, variants, that, have, developed, around, zagreb, western, and, belgrade, eastern, the, agreement, insisted, on, the, equal, status, of, cyrillic, and, latin, scripts, and, of, ekavian, and, ijekavian, pronunciations, it, also, specified, that, serbo, croatian, should, be, the, name, of, the, language, in, official, contexts, while, in, unofficial, use, the, traditional, serbian, and, croatian, were, to, be, retained, matica, hrvatska, and, matica, srpska, were, to, work, together, on, a, dictionary, and, a, committee, of, serbian, and, croatian, linguists, was, asked, to, prepare, a, pravopis, during, the, sixties, both, books, were, published, simultaneously, in, ijekavian, latin, in, zagreb, and, ekavian, cyrillic, in, novi, sad, yet, croatian, linguists, claim, that, it, was, an, act, of, unitarianism, the, evidence, supporting, this, claim, is, patchy, croatian, linguist, stjepan, babi, complained, that, the, television, transmission, from, belgrade, always, used, the, latin, alphabet, which, was, true, but, was, not, proof, of, unequal, rights, but, of, frequency, of, use, and, prestige, babi, further, complained, that, the, novi, sad, dictionary, 1967, listed, side, by, side, words, from, both, the, croatian, and, serbian, variants, wherever, they, differed, which, one, can, view, as, proof, of, careful, respect, for, both, variants, and, not, of, unitarism, moreover, croatian, linguists, criticized, those, parts, of, the, dictionary, for, being, unitaristic, that, were, written, by, croatian, linguists, and, finally, croatian, linguists, ignored, the, fact, that, the, material, for, the, pravopisni, rje, nik, came, from, the, croatian, philological, society, regardless, of, these, facts, croatian, intellectuals, brought, the, declaration, on, the, status, and, name, of, the, croatian, literary, language, in, 1967, on, occasion, of, the, publication, s, 45th, anniversary, the, croatian, weekly, journal, forum, published, the, declaration, again, in, 2012, accompanied, by, a, critical, analysis, west, european, scientists, judge, the, yugoslav, language, policy, as, an, exemplary, one, although, three, quarters, of, the, population, spoke, one, language, no, single, language, was, official, on, a, federal, level, official, languages, were, declared, only, at, the, level, of, constituent, republics, and, provinces, and, very, generously, vojvodina, had, five, among, them, slovak, and, romanian, spoken, by, 0, 5, per, cent, of, the, population, and, kosovo, four, albanian, turkish, romany, and, serbo, croatian, newspapers, radio, and, television, studios, used, sixteen, languages, fourteen, were, used, as, languages, of, tuition, in, schools, and, nine, at, universities, only, the, yugoslav, people, s, army, used, serbo, croatian, as, the, sole, language, of, command, with, all, other, languages, represented, in, the, army, s, other, activities, however, this, is, not, different, from, other, armies, of, multilingual, states, or, in, other, specific, institutions, such, as, international, air, traffic, control, where, english, is, used, worldwide, all, variants, of, serbo, croatian, were, used, in, state, administration, and, republican, and, federal, institutions, both, serbian, and, croatian, variants, were, represented, in, respectively, different, grammar, books, dictionaries, school, textbooks, and, in, books, known, as, pravopis, which, detail, spelling, rules, serbo, croatian, was, a, kind, of, soft, standardisation, however, legal, equality, could, not, dampen, the, prestige, serbo, croatian, had, since, it, was, the, language, of, three, quarters, of, the, population, it, functioned, as, an, unofficial, lingua, franca, and, within, serbo, croatian, the, serbian, variant, with, twice, as, many, speakers, as, the, croatian, enjoyed, greater, prestige, reinforced, by, the, fact, that, slovene, and, macedonian, speakers, preferred, it, to, the, croatian, variant, because, their, languages, are, also, ekavian, this, is, a, common, situation, in, other, pluricentric, languages, e, g, the, variants, of, german, differ, according, to, their, prestige, the, variants, of, portuguese, too, moreover, all, languages, differ, in, terms, of, prestige, the, fact, is, that, languages, in, terms, of, prestige, learnability, etc, are, not, equal, and, the, law, cannot, make, them, equal, the, 1946, 1953, and, 1974, constitutions, of, the, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, did, not, name, specific, official, languages, at, the, federal, level, the, 1992, constitution, of, the, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, in, 2003, renamed, serbia, and, montenegro, stated, in, article, 15, in, the, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, the, serbian, language, in, its, ekavian, and, ijekavian, dialects, and, the, cyrillic, script, shall, be, official, while, the, latin, script, shall, be, in, official, use, as, provided, for, by, the, constitution, and, law, in, 2017, the, declaration, on, the, common, language, deklaracija, o, zajedni, kom, jeziku, was, signed, by, a, group, of, ngos, and, linguists, from, former, yugoslavia, it, states, that, all, standardized, variants, belong, to, a, common, polycentric, language, with, equal, status, about, 18, million, people, declare, their, native, language, as, either, bosnian, croatian, serbian, montenegrin, or, serbo, croatian, serbian, is, spoken, by, 10, million, people, around, the, world, mostly, in, serbia, 7, 8, million, bosnia, and, herzegovina, 1, 2, million, and, montenegro, 300, 000, besides, these, serbian, minorities, are, found, in, kosovo, north, macedonia, and, in, romania, in, serbia, there, are, about, 760, 000, second, language, speakers, of, serbian, including, hungarians, in, vojvodina, and, the, 400, 000, estimated, roma, in, kosovo,

000, in, montenegro, montenegrin, is, spoken, by, 300, 000, people, globally, the, notion, of, montenegrin, as, a, separate, standard, from, serbian, is, relatively, recent, in, the, 2011, census, around, 229, 251, montenegrins, of, the, country, s, 620, 000, declared, montenegrin, as, their, native, language, that, figure, is, likely, to, increase, due, to, the, country, s, independence, and, strong, institutional, backing, of, the, montenegrin, language, serbo, croatian, is, also, a, second, language, of, many, slovenians, and, macedonians, especially, those, born, during, the, time, of, yugoslavia, according, to, the, 2002, census, serbo, croatian, and, its, variants, have, the, largest, number, of, speakers, of, the, minority, languages, in, slovenia, outside, the, balkans, there, are, over, two, million, native, speakers, of, the, language, s, especially, in, countries, which, are, frequent, targets, of, immigration, such, as, australia, austria, brazil, canada, chile, germany, hungary, italy, sweden, and, the, united, states, serbo, croatian, is, a, highly, inflected, language, traditional, grammars, list, seven, cases, for, nouns, and, adjectives, nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and, instrumental, reflecting, the, original, seven, cases, of, proto, slavic, and, indeed, older, forms, of, serbo, croatian, itself, however, in, modern, shtokavian, the, locative, has, almost, merged, into, dative, the, only, difference, is, based, on, accent, in, some, cases, and, the, other, cases, can, be, shown, declining, namely, like, most, slavic, languages, there, are, mostly, three, genders, for, nouns, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, a, distinction, which, is, still, present, even, in, the, plural, unlike, russian, and, in, part, the, akavian, dialect, they, also, have, two, numbers, singular, and, plural, however, some, consider, there, to, be, three, numbers, paucal, or, dual, too, since, still, preserved, in, closely, related, slovene, after, two, dva, dvije, dve, three, tri, and, four, etiri, and, all, numbers, ending, in, them, e, g, twenty, two, ninety, three, one, hundred, four, but, not, twelve, through, fourteen, the, genitive, singular, is, used, and, after, all, other, numbers, five, pet, and, up, the, genitive, plural, is, used, the, number, one, is, treated, as, an, adjective, adjectives, are, placed, in, front, of, the, noun, they, modify, and, must, agree, in, both, case, and, number, with, it, there, are, seven, tenses, for, verbs, past, present, future, exact, future, aorist, imperfect, and, pluperfect, and, three, moods, indicative, imperative, and, conditional, however, the, latter, three, tenses, are, typically, used, only, in, shtokavian, writing, and, the, time, sequence, of, the, exact, future, is, more, commonly, formed, through, an, alternative, construction, in, addition, like, most, slavic, languages, the, shtokavian, verb, also, has, one, of, two, aspects, perfective, or, imperfective, most, verbs, come, in, pairs, with, the, perfective, verb, being, created, out, of, the, imperfective, by, adding, a, prefix, or, making, a, stem, change, the, imperfective, aspect, typically, indicates, that, the, action, is, unfinished, in, progress, or, repetitive, while, the, perfective, aspect, typically, denotes, that, the, action, was, completed, instantaneous, or, of, limited, duration, some, tokavian, tenses, namely, aorist, and, imperfect, favor, a, particular, aspect, but, they, are, rarer, or, absent, in, akavian, and, kajkavian, actually, aspects, compensate, for, the, relative, lack, of, tenses, because, verbal, aspect, determines, whether, the, act, is, completed, or, in, progress, in, the, referred, time, the, serbo, croatian, vowel, system, is, simple, with, only, five, vowels, in, shtokavian, all, vowels, are, monophthongs, the, oral, vowels, are, as, follows, the, vowels, can, be, short, or, long, but, the, phonetic, quality, does, not, change, depending, on, the, length, in, a, word, vowels, can, be, long, in, the, stressed, syllable, and, the, syllables, following, it, never, in, the, ones, preceding, it, the, consonant, system, is, more, complicated, and, its, characteristic, features, are, series, of, affricate, and, palatal, consonants, as, in, english, voice, is, phonemic, but, aspiration, is, not, in, consonant, clusters, all, consonants, are, either, voiced, or, voiceless, all, the, consonants, are, voiced, if, the, last, consonant, is, normally, voiced, or, voiceless, if, the, last, consonant, is, normally, voiceless, this, rule, does, not, apply, to, approximants, a, consonant, cluster, may, contain, voiced, approximants, and, voiceless, consonants, as, well, as, to, foreign, words, washington, would, be, transcribed, as, va, ington, personal, names, and, when, consonants, are, not, inside, of, one, syllable, r, can, be, syllabic, playing, the, role, of, the, syllable, nucleus, in, certain, words, occasionally, it, can, even, have, a, long, accent, for, example, the, tongue, twister, navrh, brda, vrba, mrda, involves, four, words, with, syllabic, r, a, similar, feature, exists, in, czech, slovak, and, macedonian, very, rarely, other, sonorants, can, be, syllabic, like, l, in, bicikl, surname, tarklj, n, unit, njutn, as, well, as, m, and, in, slang, apart, from, slovene, serbo, croatian, is, the, only, slavic, language, with, a, pitch, accent, simple, tone, system, this, feature, is, present, in, some, other, indo, european, languages, such, as, norwegian, ancient, greek, and, punjabi, neo, shtokavian, serbo, croatian, which, is, used, as, the, basis, for, standard, bosnian, croatian, montenegrin, and, serbian, has, four, accents, which, involve, either, a, rising, or, falling, tone, on, either, long, or, short, vowels, with, optional, post, tonic, lengths, the, tone, stressed, vowels, can, be, approximated, in, english, with, set, vs, setting, said, in, isolation, for, a, short, tonic, e, or, leave, vs, leaving, for, a, long, tonic, i, due, to, the, prosody, of, final, stressed, syllables, in, english, general, accent, rules, in, the, standard, language, there, are, no, other, rules, for, accent, placement, thus, the, accent, of, every, word, must, be, learned, individually, furthermore, in, inflection, accent, shifts, are, common, both, in, type, and, position, the, so, called, mobile, paradigms, the, second, rule, is, not, strictly, obeyed, especially, in, borrowed, words, comparative, and, historical, linguistics, offers, some, clues, for, memorising, the, accent, position, if, one, compares, many, standard, serbo, croatian, words, to, e, g, cognate, russian, words, the, accent, in, the, serbo, croatian, word, will, be, one, syllable, before, the, one, in, the, russian, word, with, the, rising, tone, historically, the, rising, tone, appeared, when, the, place, of, the, accent, shifted, to, the, preceding, syllable, the, so, called, neo, shtokavian, retraction, but, the, quality, of, this, new, accent, was, different, its, melody, still, gravitated, towards, the, original, syllable, most, shtokavian, neo, shtokavian, dialects, underwent, this, shift, but, chakavian, kajkavian, and, the, old, shtokavian, dialects, did, not, accent, diacritics, are, not, used, in, the, ordinary, orthography, but, only, in, the, linguistic, or, language, learning, literature, e, g, dictionaries, orthography, and, grammar, books, however, there, are, very, few, minimal, pairs, where, an, error, in, accent, can, lead, to, misunderstanding, serbo, croatian, orthography, is, almost, entirely, phonetic, thus, most, words, should, be, spelled, as, they, are, pronounced, in, practice, the, writing, system, does, not, take, into, account, allophones, which, occur, as, a, result, of, interaction, between, words, also, there, are, some, exceptions, mostly, applied, to, foreign, words, and, compounds, that, favor, morphological, etymological, over, phonetic, spelling, one, systemic, exception, is, that, the, consonant, clusters, ds, and, d, are, not, respelled, as, ts, and, t, although, d, tends, to, be, unvoiced, in, normal, speech, in, such, clusters, only, a, few, words, are, intentionally, misspelled, mostly, in, order, to, resolve, ambiguity, through, history, this, language, has, been, written, in, a, number, of, writing, systems, the, oldest, texts, since, the, 11th, century, are, in, glagolitic, and, the, oldest, preserved, text, written, completely, in, the, latin, alphabet, is, red, i, zakon, sestara, reda, svetog, dominika, from, 1345, the, arabic, alphabet, had, been, used, by, bosniaks, greek, writing, is, out, of, use, there, and, arabic, and, glagolitic, persisted, so, far, partly, in, religious, liturgies, the, serbian, cyrillic, alphabet, was, revised, by, vuk, stefanovi, karad, i, in, the, 19th, century, the, croatian, latin, alphabet, gajica, followed, suit, shortly, afterwards, when, ljudevit, gaj, defined, it, as, standard, latin, with, five, extra, letters, that, had, diacritics, apparently, borrowing, much, from, czech, but, also, from, polish, and, inventing, the, unique, digraphs, lj, nj, and, d, these, digraphs, are, represented, as, and, respectively, in, the, rje, nik, hrvatskog, ili, srpskog, jezika, published, by, the, former, yugoslav, academy, of, sciences, and, arts, in, zagreb, the, latter, digraphs, however, are, unused, in, the, literary, standard, of, the, language, all, in, all, this, makes, serbo, croatian, the, only, slavic, language, to, officially, use, both, the, latin, and, cyrillic, scripts, albeit, the, latin, version, is, more, commonly, used, in, both, cases, spelling, is, phonetic, and, spellings, in, the, two, alphabets, map, to, each, other, one, to, one, the, digraphs, lj, nj, and, d, represent, distinct, phonemes, and, are, considered, to, be, single, letters, in, crosswords, they, are, put, into, a, single, square, and, in, sorting, lj, follows, l, and, nj, follows, n, except, in, a, few, words, where, the, individual, letters, are, pronounced, separately, for, instance, nad, iv, j, eti, to, outlive, is, composed, of, the, prefix, nad, out, over, and, the, verb, iv, j, eti, to, live, the, cyrillic, alphabet, avoids, such, ambiguity, by, providing, a, single, letter, for, each, phoneme, used, to, be, commonly, written, as, dj, on, typewriters, but, that, practice, led, to, too, many, ambiguities, it, is, also, used, on, car, license, plates, today, dj, is, often, used, again, in, place, of, on, the, internet, as, a, replacement, due, to, the, lack, of, installed, serbo, croat, keyboard, layouts, serbian, bosnian, and, montenegrin, standards, officially, use, both, alphabets, while, croatian, uses, the, latin, only, latin, script, has, been, rising, in, popularity, in, serbia, with, the, advent, of, the, digital, age, and, internet, in, serbia, whether, due, to, restraints, cyrillic, letters, use, up, twice, the, space, and, therefore, cost, on, sms, accessibility, intention, to, be, readable, internationally, as, latin, is, taught, in, all, four, countries, speaking, the, language, or, ease, of, use, this, has, been, perceived, by, serbian, government, officials, as, a, suppression, and, threat, for, existence, of, the, national, script, that, is, cyrillic, with, the, ministry, of, culture, and, information, of, serbia, pushing, for, more, tight, language, laws, on, top, of, those, stipulated, by, the, existing, constitution, montenegrin, alphabet, adopted, in, 2009, provides, replacements, of, sj, and, zj, with, an, addition, of, acute, accent, on, s, and, z, forming, and, in, both, latin, and, cyrillic, but, they, remain, largely, unused, even, by, the, parliament, of, montenegro, which, introduced, them, an, experimental, alphabet, called, slavica, fusing, latin, and, cyrillic, was, devised, by, linguistic, amateur, rajko, igi, in, 1986, and, published, in, his, 1987, book, nova, slovarica, in, a, quixotic, attempt, to, mend, the, linguistic, differences, and, ambiguities, between, the, two, alphabets, carefully, avoiding, graphemes, that, look, alike, and, following, the, principle, of, one, sound, one, letter, already, accomplished, by, the, cyrillic, alphabet, unicode, has, separate, characters, for, the, digraphs, lj, nj, and, d, south, slavic, historically, formed, a, dialect, continuum, i, e, each, dialect, has, some, similarities, with, the, neighboring, one, and, differences, grow, with, distance, however, migrations, from, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, resulting, from, the, spread, of, ottoman, empire, on, the, balkans, have, caused, large, scale, population, displacement, that, broke, the, dialect, continuum, into, many, geographical, pockets, migrations, in, the, 20th, century, primarily, caused, by, urbanization, and, wars, also, contributed, to, the, reduction, of, dialectal, differences, the, primary, dialects, are, named, after, the, most, common, question, word, for, what, shtokavian, uses, the, pronoun, to, or, ta, chakavian, uses, a, or, ca, kajkavian, kajkavski, kaj, or, kej, in, native, terminology, they, are, referred, to, as, nar, j, e, je, which, would, be, equivalent, of, group, of, dialects, whereas, their, many, subdialects, are, referred, to, as, dijalekti, dialects, or, govori, speeches, the, pluricentric, serbo, croatian, standard, language, and, all, four, contemporary, standard, variants, are, based, on, the, eastern, herzegovinian, subdialect, of, neo, shtokavian, other, dialects, are, not, taught, in, schools, or, used, by, the, state, media, the, torlakian, dialect, is, often, added, to, the, list, though, sources, usually, note, that, it, is, a, transitional, dialect, between, shtokavian, and, the, bulgaro, macedonian, dialects, the, serbo, croatian, dialects, differ, not, only, in, the, question, word, they, are, named, after, but, also, heavily, in, phonology, accentuation, and, intonation, case, endings, and, tense, system, morphology, and, basic, vocabulary, in, the, past, chakavian, and, kajkavian, dialects, were, spoken, on, a, much, larger, territory, but, have, been, replaced, by, tokavian, during, the, period, of, migrations, caused, by, ottoman, turkish, conquest, of, the, balkans, in, the, 15th, and, the, 16th, centuries, these, migrations, caused, the, koin, isation, of, the, shtokavian, dialects, that, used, to, form, the, west, shtokavian, more, closer, and, transitional, towards, the, neighbouring, chakavian, and, kajkavian, dialects, and, east, shtokavian, transitional, towards, the, torlakian, and, the, whole, bulgaro, macedonian, area, dialect, bundles, and, their, subsequent, spread, at, the, expense, of, chakavian, and, kajkavian, as, a, result, tokavian, now, covers, an, area, larger, than, all, the, other, dialects, combined, and, continues, to, make, its, progress, in, the, enclaves, where, non, literary, dialects, are, still, being, spoken, the, differences, among, the, dialects, can, be, illustrated, on, the, example, of, schleicher, s, fable, diacritic, signs, are, used, to, show, the, difference, in, accents, and, prosody, which, are, often, quite, significant, but, which, are, not, reflected, in, the, usual, orthography, a, series, of, isoglosses, crosscuts, the, main, dialects, the, modern, reflexes, of, the, long, common, slavic, vowel, jat, usually, transcribed, vary, by, location, as, i, e, and, ije, or, je, local, varieties, of, the, dialects, are, labeled, ikavian, ekavian, and, ijekavian, respectively, depending, on, the, reflex, the, long, and, short, jat, is, reflected, as, long, or, short, i, and, e, in, ikavian, and, ekavian, but, ijekavian, dialects, introduce, a, ije, je, alternation, to, retain, a, distinction, standard, croatian, and, bosnian, are, based, on, ijekavian, whereas, serbian, uses, both, ekavian, and, ijekavian, forms, ijekavian, for, bosnian, serbs, ekavian, for, most, of, serbia, influence, of, standard, language, through, state, media, and, education, has, caused, non, standard, varieties, to, lose, ground, to, the, literary, forms, the, jat, reflex, rules, are, not, without, exception, for, example, when, short, jat, is, preceded, by, r, in, most, ijekavian, dialects, developed, into, re, or, occasionally, ri, the, prefix, pr, trans, over, when, long, became, pre, in, eastern, ijekavian, dialects, but, to, prije, in, western, dialects, in, ikavian, pronunciation, it, also, evolved, into, pre, or, prije, due, to, potential, ambiguity, with, pri, approach, come, close, to, for, verbs, that, had, ti, in, their, infinitive, the, past, participle, ending, l, evolved, into, io, in, ijekavian, neo, tokavian, the, following, are, some, examples, the, nature, and, classification, of, serbo, croatian, has, been, the, subject, of, long, standing, sociolinguistic, debate, the, question, is, whether, serbo, croatian, should, be, called, a, single, language, or, a, cluster, of, closely, related, languages, linguist, enisa, kafadar, argues, that, there, is, only, one, serbo, croatian, language, with, several, varieties, this, has, made, it, possible, to, include, all, four, varieties, in, new, grammars, of, the, language, daniel, bun, i, concludes, that, it, is, a, pluricentric, language, with, four, standard, variants, spoken, in, serbia, croatia, montenegro, and, bosnia, herzegovina, the, mutual, intelligibility, between, their, speakers, exceeds, that, between, the, standard, variants, of, english, french, german, or, spanish, there, is, no, doubt, of, the, near, 100, mutual, intelligibility, of, standard, croatian, and, standard, serbian, as, is, obvious, from, the, ability, of, all, groups, to, enjoy, each, others, films, tv, and, sports, broadcasts, newspapers, rock, lyrics, etc, other, linguists, have, argued, that, the, differences, between, the, variants, of, serbo, croatian, are, less, significant, than, those, between, the, variants, of, english, german, dutch, and, hindustani, among, pluricentric, languages, serbo, croatian, was, the, only, one, with, a, pluricentric, standardisation, within, one, state, the, dissolution, of, yugoslavia, has, made, serbo, croatian, even, more, of, a, typical, pluricentric, language, since, the, variants, of, other, pluricentric, languages, are, also, spoken, in, different, states, as, in, other, pluricentric, languages, all, serbo, croatian, standard, varieties, are, based, on, the, same, dialect, the, eastern, herzegovinian, subdialect, of, the, shtokavian, dialect, and, consequently, according, to, the, sociolinguistic, definitions, constitute, a, single, pluricentric, language, and, not, for, example, several, ausbau, languages, according, to, linguist, john, bailyn, an, examination, of, all, the, major, levels, of, language, shows, that, bcs, is, clearly, a, single, language, with, a, single, grammatical, system, in, 2017, numerous, prominent, writers, scientists, journalists, activists, and, other, public, figures, from, croatia, bosnia, herzegovina, montenegro, and, serbia, signed, the, declaration, on, the, common, language, which, states, that, in, croatia, serbia, bosnia, herzegovina, and, montenegro, a, common, polycentric, standard, language, is, used, consisting, of, several, standard, varieties, such, as, german, english, or, spanish, the, use, of, serbo, croatian, as, a, linguistic, label, has, been, the, subject, of, long, standing, controversy, linguist, wayles, browne, calls, it, a, term, of, convenience, and, notes, the, difference, of, opinion, as, to, whether, it, comprises, a, single, language, or, a, cluster, of, languages, ronelle, alexander, refers, to, the, national, standards, as, three, separate, languages, but, also, notes, that, the, reasons, for, this, are, complex, and, generally, non, linguistic, she, calls, bcs, her, term, for, serbo, croatian, a, single, language, for, communicative, linguistic, purposes, but, three, separate, languages, for, symbolic, non, linguistic, purposes, the, current, serbian, constitution, of, 2006, refers, to, the, official, language, as, serbian, while, the, montenegrin, constitution, of, 2007, proclaimed, montenegrin, as, the, primary, official, language, but, also, grants, other, languages, and, dialects, the, right, of, official, use, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, has, specified, different, universal, decimal, classification, udc, numbers, for, croatian, udc, 862, abbreviation, hr, and, serbian, udc, 861, abbreviation, sr, while, the, cover, term, serbo, croatian, is, used, to, refer, to, the, combination, of, original, signs, udc, 861, 862, abbreviation, sh, furthermore, the, iso, 639, standard, designates, the, bosnian, language, with, the, abbreviations, bos, and, bs, while, it, operated, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, which, had, english, and, french, as, official, languages, translated, court, proceedings, and, documents, into, what, it, referred, to, as, bosnian, croatian, serbian, usually, abbreviated, as, bcs, translators, were, employed, from, all, regions, of, the, former, yugoslavia, and, all, national, and, regional, variations, were, accepted, regardless, of, the, nationality, of, the, person, on, trial, sometimes, against, a, defendant, s, objections, on, the, grounds, of, mutual, intelligibility, for, utilitarian, purposes, serbo, croatian, is, often, called, na, jezik, our, language, or, na, ki, sic, ourish, or, ourian, by, native, speakers, this, term, is, frequently, used, to, describe, serbo, croatian, by, those, who, wish, to, avoid, nationalistic, and, linguistic, discussions, native, speakers, traditionally, describe, their, language, as, jedan, ali, ne, jedinstven, one, but, not, uniform, in, 2021, the, board, for, standardization, of, the, serbian, language, issued, an, opinion, that, serbo, croatian, is, one, language, and, that, it, should, be, referred, to, as, serbian, language, while, croatian, bosnian, and, montenegrin, are, to, be, considered, merely, local, names, for, serbian, language, this, opinion, was, widely, criticized, by, croatian, government, and, representatives, of, the, croatian, minority, in, serbia, serbian, linguist, ranko, bugarski, called, this, opinion, absurd, and, legacy, of, the, 19th, century, linguistics, he, said, that, serbo, croatian, should, be, considered, one, language, in, a, scientific, sense, under, the, serbo, croatian, label, but, four, different, languages, in, an, administrative, sense, legally, croatian, bosnian, and, montenegrin, are, all, officially, recognized, minority, languages, in, serbia, the, serbian, government, also, officially, recognized, bunjevac, language, as, a, standard, minority, language, in, 2018, and, was, approved, by, the, serbian, ministry, of, education, for, learning, in, schools, the, opinion, of, the, majority, of, croatian, linguists, is, that, there, has, never, been, a, serbo, croatian, language, but, two, different, standard, languages, that, overlapped, sometime, in, the, course, of, history, however, croatian, linguist, snje, ana, kordi, has, been, leading, an, academic, discussion, on, this, issue, in, the, croatian, journal, knji, evna, republika, from, 2001, to, 2010, in, the, discussion, she, shows, that, linguistic, criteria, such, as, mutual, intelligibility, the, huge, overlap, in, the, linguistic, system, and, the, same, dialect, basis, of, the, standard, language, are, evidence, that, croatian, serbian, bosnian, and, montenegrin, are, four, national, variants, of, the, pluricentric, serbo, croatian, language, igor, mandi, states, during, the, last, ten, years, it, has, been, the, longest, the, most, serious, and, most, acrid, discussion, in, 21st, century, croatian, culture, inspired, by, that, discussion, a, monograph, on, language, and, nationalism, has, been, published, the, view, of, the, majority, of, croatian, linguists, that, there, is, no, single, serbo, croatian, language, but, several, different, standard, languages, has, been, sharply, criticized, by, german, linguist, bernhard, gr, schel, in, his, monograph, serbo, croatian, between, linguistics, and, politics, a, more, detailed, overview, incorporating, arguments, from, croatian, philology, and, contemporary, linguistics, would, be, as, follows, the, linguistic, debate, in, this, region, is, more, about, politics, than, about, linguistics, per, se, the, topic, of, language, for, writers, from, dalmatia, and, dubrovnik, prior, to, the, 19th, century, made, a, distinction, only, between, speakers, of, italian, or, slavic, since, those, were, the, two, main, groups, that, inhabited, dalmatian, city, states, at, that, time, whether, someone, spoke, croatian, or, serbian, was, not, an, important, distinction, then, as, the, two, languages, were, not, distinguished, by, most, speakers, however, most, intellectuals, and, writers, from, dalmatia, who, used, the, tokavian, dialect, and, practiced, the, catholic, faith, saw, themselves, as, part, of, a, croatian, nation, as, far, back, as, the, mid, 16th, to, 17th, centuries, some, 300, years, before, serbo, croatian, ideology, appeared, their, loyalty, was, first, and, foremost, to, catholic, christendom, but, when, they, professed, an, ethnic, identity, they, referred, to, themselves, as, slovin, and, illyrian, a, sort, of, forerunner, of, catholic, baroque, pan, slavism, and, croat, these, 30, odd, writers, over, the, span, of, c, 350, years, always, saw, themselves, as, croats, first, and, never, as, part, of, a, serbian, nation, in, the, pre, national, era, catholic, religious, orientation, did, not, necessarily, equate, with, croat, ethnic, identity, in, dalmatia, a, croatian, follower, of, vuk, karad, i, ivan, broz, noted, that, for, a, dalmatian, to, identify, oneself, as, a, serb, was, seen, as, foreign, as, identifying, oneself, as, macedonian, or, greek, vatroslav, jagi, pointed, out, in, 1864, as, i, have, mentioned, in, the, preface, history, knows, only, two, national, names, in, these, parts, croatian, and, serbian, as, far, as, dubrovnik, is, concerned, the, serbian, name, was, never, in, use, on, the, contrary, the, croatian, name, was, frequently, used, and, gladly, referred, to, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, sermons, and, poems, were, exquisitely, crafted, in, croatian, by, those, men, whose, names, are, widely, renowned, by, deep, learning, and, piety, on, the, other, hand, the, opinion, of, jagi, from, 1864, is, argued, not, to, have, firm, grounds, when, jagi, says, croatian, he, refers, to, a, few, cases, referring, to, the, dubrovnik, vernacular, as, ilirski, illyrian, this, was, a, common, name, for, all, slavic, vernaculars, in, dalmatian, cities, among, the, roman, inhabitants, in, the, meantime, other, written, monuments, are, found, that, mention, srpski, lingua, serviana, serbian, and, some, that, mention, croatian, by, far, the, most, competent, serbian, scientist, on, the, dubrovnik, language, issue, milan, re, etar, who, was, born, in, dubrovnik, himself, wrote, behalf, of, language, characteristics, the, one, who, thinks, that, croatian, and, serbian, are, two, separate, languages, must, confess, that, dubrovnik, always, linguistically, used, to, be, serbian, finally, the, former, medieval, texts, from, dubrovnik, and, montenegro, dating, before, the, 16th, century, were, neither, true, tokavian, nor, serbian, but, mostly, specific, a, jekavian, akavian, that, was, nearer, to, actual, adriatic, islanders, in, croatia, nationalists, have, conflicting, views, the, nationalists, among, the, croats, conflictingly, claim, either, that, they, speak, an, entirely, separate, language, from, serbs, and, bosniaks, or, that, these, two, peoples, have, due, to, the, longer, lexicographic, tradition, among, croats, somehow, borrowed, their, standard, languages, from, them, bosniak, nationalists, claim, that, both, croats, and, serbs, have, appropriated, the, bosnian, language, since, ljudevit, gaj, and, vuk, karad, i, preferred, the, neo, tokavian, ijekavian, dialect, widely, spoken, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, as, the, basis, for, language, standardization, whereas, the, nationalists, among, the, serbs, claim, either, that, any, divergence, in, the, language, is, artificial, or, claim, that, the, tokavian, dialect, is, theirs, and, the, akavian, croats, in, more, extreme, formulations, croats, have, taken, or, stolen, their, language, from, the, serbs, proponents, of, unity, among, southern, slavs, claim, that, there, is, a, single, language, with, normal, dialectal, variations, the, term, serbo, croatian, or, synonyms, is, not, officially, used, in, any, of, the, successor, countries, of, former, yugoslavia, in, serbia, the, serbian, standard, has, an, official, status, countrywide, while, both, serbian, and, croatian, are, official, in, the, province, of, vojvodina, a, large, bosniak, minority, is, present, in, the, southwest, region, of, sand, ak, but, the, official, recognition, of, bosnian, is, moot, bosnian, is, an, optional,
