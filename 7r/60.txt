property, is, a, system, of, rights, that, gives, people, legal, control, of, valuable, things, and, also, refers, to, the, valuable, things, themselves, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, property, an, owner, of, property, may, have, the, right, to, consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give, away, or, destroy, it, or, to, exclude, others, from, doing, these, things, as, well, as, to, perhaps, abandon, it, whereas, regardless, of, the, nature, of, the, property, the, owner, thereof, has, the, right, to, properly, use, it, under, the, granted, property, rights, in, economics, and, political, economy, there, are, three, broad, forms, of, property, private, property, public, property, and, collective, property, also, called, cooperative, property, property, that, jointly, belongs, to, more, than, one, party, may, be, possessed, or, controlled, thereby, in, very, similar, or, very, distinct, ways, whether, simply, or, complexly, whether, equally, or, unequally, however, there, is, an, expectation, that, each, party, s, will, rather, discretion, with, regard, to, the, property, be, clearly, defined, and, unconditional, to, distinguish, ownership, and, easement, from, rent, the, parties, might, expect, their, wills, to, be, unanimous, or, alternatively, every, given, one, of, them, when, no, opportunity, for, or, possibility, of, a, dispute, with, any, other, of, them, exists, may, expect, his, her, it, s, or, their, own, will, to, be, sufficient, and, absolute, the, first, restatement, defines, property, as, anything, tangible, or, intangible, whereby, a, legal, relationship, between, persons, and, the, state, enforces, a, possessory, interest, or, legal, title, in, that, thing, this, mediating, relationship, between, individual, property, and, state, is, called, a, property, regime, in, sociology, and, anthropology, property, is, often, defined, as, a, relationship, between, two, or, more, individuals, and, an, object, in, which, at, least, one, of, these, individuals, holds, a, bundle, of, rights, over, the, object, the, distinction, between, collective, property, and, private, property, is, regarded, as, confusion, since, different, individuals, often, hold, differing, rights, over, a, single, object, types, of, property, include, real, property, the, combination, of, land, and, any, improvements, to, or, on, the, ground, personal, property, physical, possessions, belonging, to, a, person, private, property, property, owned, by, legal, persons, business, entities, or, individual, natural, persons, public, property, state, owned, or, publicly, owned, and, available, possessions, and, intellectual, property, exclusive, rights, over, artistic, creations, inventions, etc, however, the, last, is, not, always, as, widely, recognized, or, enforced, an, article, of, property, may, have, physical, and, incorporeal, parts, a, title, or, a, right, of, ownership, establishes, the, relation, between, the, property, and, other, persons, assuring, the, owner, the, right, to, dispose, of, the, property, as, the, owner, sees, fit, the, unqualified, term, property, is, often, used, to, refer, specifically, to, real, property, property, is, often, defined, by, the, code, of, the, local, sovereignty, and, protected, wholly, or, more, usually, partially, by, such, entity, the, owner, being, responsible, for, any, remainder, of, protection, the, standards, of, the, proof, concerning, proofs, of, ownerships, are, also, addressed, by, the, code, of, the, local, sovereignty, and, such, entity, plays, a, role, accordingly, typically, somewhat, managerial, some, philosophers, assert, that, property, rights, arise, from, social, convention, while, others, find, justifications, for, them, in, morality, or, in, natural, law, various, scholarly, disciplines, such, as, law, economics, anthropology, or, sociology, may, treat, the, concept, more, systematically, but, definitions, vary, most, particularly, when, involving, contracts, positive, law, defines, such, rights, and, the, judiciary, can, adjudicate, and, enforce, property, rights, according, to, adam, smith, 1723, 1790, the, expectation, of, profit, from, improving, one, s, stock, of, capital, rests, on, private, property, rights, capitalism, has, as, a, central, assumption, that, property, rights, encourage, their, holders, to, develop, the, property, generate, wealth, and, efficiently, allocate, resources, based, on, the, operation, of, markets, from, this, has, evolved, the, modern, conception, of, property, as, a, right, enforced, by, positive, law, in, the, expectation, that, this, will, produce, more, wealth, and, better, standards, of, living, however, smith, also, expressed, a, very, critical, view, of, the, effects, of, property, laws, on, inequality, wherever, there, is, a, great, property, there, is, great, inequality, civil, government, so, far, as, it, is, instituted, for, the, security, of, property, is, in, reality, instituted, for, the, defense, of, the, rich, against, the, poor, or, of, those, who, have, some, property, against, those, who, have, none, at, all, in, his, 1881, text, the, common, law, oliver, wendell, holmes, describes, property, as, having, two, fundamental, aspects, the, first, possession, can, be, defined, as, control, over, a, resource, based, on, the, practical, inability, to, contradict, the, ends, of, the, possessor, the, second, title, is, the, expectation, that, others, will, recognize, rights, to, control, resources, even, when, not, in, possession, he, elaborates, on, the, differences, between, these, two, concepts, and, proposes, a, history, of, how, they, came, to, be, attached, to, persons, as, opposed, to, families, or, entities, such, as, the, church, both, communism, and, some, forms, of, socialism, have, also, upheld, the, notion, that, private, ownership, of, capital, is, inherently, illegitimate, this, argument, centers, on, the, idea, that, private, ownership, of, capital, always, benefits, one, class, over, another, giving, rise, to, domination, through, this, privately, owned, capital, communists, do, not, oppose, personal, property, that, is, hard, won, self, acquired, self, earned, as, the, communist, manifesto, puts, it, by, members, of, the, proletariat, both, socialism, and, communism, distinguish, carefully, between, private, ownership, of, capital, land, factories, resources, etc, and, private, property, homes, material, objects, and, so, forth, most, legal, systems, distinguish, between, different, types, of, property, especially, between, land, immovable, property, estate, in, land, real, estate, real, property, and, all, other, forms, of, property, goods, and, chattels, movable, property, or, personal, property, including, the, value, of, legal, tender, if, not, the, legal, tender, itself, as, the, manufacturer, rather, than, the, possessor, might, be, the, owner, they, often, distinguish, tangible, and, intangible, property, one, categorization, scheme, specifies, three, species, of, property, land, improvements, immovable, man, made, things, and, personal, property, movable, man, made, things, in, common, law, real, property, immovable, property, is, the, combination, of, interests, in, land, and, improvements, thereto, and, personal, property, is, interest, in, movable, property, real, property, rights, are, rights, relating, to, the, land, these, rights, include, ownership, and, usage, owners, can, grant, rights, to, persons, and, entities, in, the, form, of, leases, licenses, and, easements, throughout, the, last, centuries, of, the, second, millennium, with, the, development, of, more, complex, theories, of, property, the, concept, of, personal, property, had, become, divided, into, tangible, property, such, as, cars, and, clothing, and, intangible, property, such, as, financial, assets, and, related, rights, including, stocks, and, bonds, intellectual, property, including, patents, copyrights, and, trademarks, digital, files, communication, channels, and, certain, forms, of, identifier, including, internet, domain, names, some, forms, of, network, address, some, forms, of, handle, and, again, trademarks, treatment, of, intangible, property, is, such, that, an, article, of, property, is, by, law, or, otherwise, by, traditional, conceptualization, subject, to, expiration, even, when, inheritable, which, is, a, key, distinction, from, tangible, property, upon, expiration, the, property, if, of, the, intellectual, category, becomes, a, part, of, public, domain, to, be, used, by, but, not, owned, by, anybody, and, possibly, used, by, more, than, one, party, simultaneously, due, to, the, inapplicability, of, scarcity, to, intellectual, property, whereas, things, such, as, communications, channels, and, pairs, of, electromagnetic, spectrum, bands, and, signal, transmission, power, can, only, be, used, by, a, single, party, at, a, time, or, a, single, party, in, a, divisible, context, if, owned, or, used, thus, far, or, usually, those, are, not, considered, property, or, at, least, not, private, property, even, though, the, party, bearing, right, of, exclusive, use, may, transfer, that, right, to, another, in, many, societies, the, human, body, is, considered, property, of, some, kind, or, other, the, question, of, the, ownership, and, rights, to, one, s, body, arise, in, general, in, the, discussion, of, human, rights, including, the, specific, issues, of, slavery, conscription, rights, of, children, under, the, age, of, majority, marriage, abortion, prostitution, drugs, euthanasia, and, organ, donation, of, the, following, only, sale, and, at, will, sharing, involve, no, encumbrance, the, two, major, justifications, are, given, for, the, original, property, or, the, homestead, principle, are, effort, and, scarcity, john, locke, emphasized, effort, mixing, your, labor, with, an, object, or, clearing, and, cultivating, virgin, land, benjamin, tucker, preferred, to, look, at, the, telos, of, property, i, e, what, is, the, purpose, of, property, his, answer, to, solve, the, scarcity, problem, only, when, items, are, relatively, scarce, concerning, people, s, desires, do, they, become, property, for, example, hunter, gatherers, did, not, consider, land, to, be, property, since, there, was, no, shortage, of, land, agrarian, societies, later, made, arable, land, property, as, it, was, scarce, for, something, to, be, economically, scarce, it, must, necessarily, have, the, exclusivity, property, that, use, by, one, person, excludes, others, from, using, it, these, two, justifications, lead, to, different, conclusions, on, what, can, be, property, intellectual, property, incorporeal, things, like, ideas, plans, orderings, and, arrangements, musical, compositions, novels, computer, programs, are, generally, considered, valid, property, to, those, who, support, an, effort, justification, but, invalid, to, those, who, support, a, scarcity, justification, since, the, things, don, t, have, the, exclusivity, property, however, those, who, support, a, scarcity, justification, may, still, support, other, intellectual, property, laws, such, as, copyright, as, long, as, these, are, a, subject, of, contract, instead, of, government, arbitration, thus, even, ardent, propertarians, may, disagree, about, ip, by, either, standard, one, s, body, is, one, s, property, from, some, anarchist, points, of, view, the, validity, of, property, depends, on, whether, the, property, right, requires, enforcement, by, the, state, different, forms, of, property, require, different, amounts, of, enforcement, intellectual, property, requires, a, great, deal, of, state, intervention, to, enforce, ownership, of, distant, physical, property, requires, quite, a, lot, ownership, of, carried, objects, requires, very, little, in, contrast, requesting, one, s, own, body, requires, absolutely, no, state, intervention, so, some, anarchists, don, t, believe, in, property, at, all, many, things, have, existed, that, did, not, have, an, owner, sometimes, called, the, commons, the, term, commons, however, is, also, often, used, to, mean, something, entirely, different, general, collective, ownership, i, e, common, ownership, also, the, same, term, is, sometimes, used, by, statists, to, mean, government, owned, property, that, the, general, public, is, allowed, to, access, public, property, law, in, all, societies, has, tended, to, reduce, the, number, of, things, not, having, clear, owners, supporters, of, property, rights, argue, that, this, enables, better, protection, of, scarce, resources, due, to, the, tragedy, of, the, commons, at, the, same, time, critics, say, that, it, leads, to, the, exploitation, of, those, resources, for, personal, gain, and, that, it, hinders, taking, advantage, of, potential, network, effects, these, arguments, have, differing, validity, for, different, types, of, property, things, that, are, not, scarce, are, for, instance, not, subject, to, the, tragedy, of, the, commons, some, apparent, critics, advocate, general, collective, ownership, rather, than, ownerlessness, things, that, do, not, have, owners, include, ideas, except, for, intellectual, property, seawater, which, is, however, protected, by, anti, pollution, laws, parts, of, the, seafloor, see, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, for, restrictions, gases, in, earth, s, atmosphere, animals, in, the, wild, although, in, most, nations, animals, are, tied, to, the, land, in, the, united, states, and, canada, wildlife, is, generally, defined, in, statute, as, property, of, the, state, this, public, ownership, of, wildlife, is, referred, to, as, the, north, american, model, of, wildlife, conservation, and, is, based, on, the, public, trust, doctrine, celestial, bodies, and, outer, space, and, land, in, antarctica, the, nature, of, children, under, the, age, of, majority, is, another, contested, issue, here, in, ancient, societies, children, were, generally, considered, the, property, of, their, parents, however, children, in, most, modern, communities, theoretically, own, their, bodies, but, are, not, regarded, as, competent, to, exercise, their, rights, their, parents, or, guardians, are, given, most, of, the, fundamental, rights, of, control, over, them, questions, regarding, the, nature, of, ownership, of, the, body, also, come, up, in, the, issue, of, abortion, drugs, and, euthanasia, in, many, ancient, legal, systems, e, g, early, roman, law, religious, sites, e, g, temples, were, considered, property, of, the, god, or, gods, they, were, devoted, to, however, religious, pluralism, makes, it, more, convenient, to, have, sacred, sites, owned, by, the, spiritual, body, that, runs, them, intellectual, property, and, air, airspace, no, fly, zone, pollution, laws, which, can, include, tradable, emissions, rights, can, be, property, in, some, senses, of, the, word, ownership, of, land, can, be, held, separately, from, the, ownership, of, rights, over, that, land, including, sporting, rights, mineral, rights, development, rights, air, rights, and, such, other, rights, as, may, be, worth, segregating, from, simple, land, ownership, ownership, laws, may, vary, widely, among, countries, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, property, of, interest, e, g, firearms, real, property, personal, property, animals, persons, can, own, property, directly, in, most, societies, legal, entities, such, as, corporations, trusts, and, nations, or, governments, own, property, in, many, countries, women, have, limited, access, to, property, following, restrictive, inheritance, and, family, laws, under, which, only, men, have, actual, or, formal, rights, to, own, property, in, the, inca, empire, the, dead, emperors, considered, gods, still, controlled, property, after, death, in, 17th, century, england, the, legal, directive, that, nobody, may, enter, a, home, which, in, the, 17th, century, would, typically, have, been, male, owned, unless, by, the, owner, s, invitation, or, consent, was, established, as, common, law, in, sir, edward, coke, s, institutes, of, the, lawes, of, england, for, a, man, s, house, is, his, castle, et, domus, sua, cuique, est, tutissimum, refugium, it, is, the, origin, of, the, famous, dictum, an, englishman, s, home, is, his, castle, the, ruling, enshrined, into, law, what, several, english, writers, had, espoused, in, the, 16th, century, unlike, the, rest, of, europe, the, british, had, a, proclivity, towards, owning, their, own, homes, british, prime, minister, william, pitt, 1st, earl, of, chatham, defined, the, meaning, of, castle, in, 1763, the, poorest, man, may, in, his, cottage, bid, defiance, to, all, the, forces, of, the, crown, it, may, be, frail, its, roof, may, shake, the, wind, may, blow, through, it, the, storm, may, enter, the, rain, may, enter, but, the, king, of, england, cannot, enter, that, principle, was, carried, to, the, united, states, under, u, s, law, the, principal, limitations, on, whether, and, the, extent, to, which, the, state, may, interfere, with, property, rights, are, set, by, the, constitution, the, takings, clause, requires, that, the, government, whether, state, or, federal, for, the, 14th, amendment, s, due, process, clause, imposes, the, 5th, amendment, s, takings, clause, on, state, governments, may, take, private, property, only, for, a, public, purpose, after, exercising, due, process, of, law, and, upon, making, just, compensation, if, an, interest, is, not, deemed, a, property, right, or, the, conduct, is, merely, an, intentional, tort, these, limitations, do, not, apply, and, the, doctrine, of, sovereign, immunity, precludes, relief, moreover, if, the, interference, does, not, almost, completely, make, the, property, valueless, the, interference, will, not, be, deemed, a, taking, but, instead, a, mere, regulation, of, use, on, the, other, hand, some, governmental, regulations, of, property, use, have, been, deemed, so, severe, that, they, have, been, considered, regulatory, takings, moreover, conduct, is, sometimes, deemed, only, a, nuisance, or, another, tort, has, been, held, a, taking, of, property, where, the, conduct, was, sufficiently, persistent, and, severe, there, exist, many, theories, of, property, one, is, the, relatively, rare, first, possession, theory, of, property, where, ownership, of, something, is, seen, as, justified, simply, by, someone, seizing, something, before, someone, else, does, perhaps, one, of, the, most, popular, is, the, natural, rights, definition, of, property, rights, as, advanced, by, john, locke, locke, advanced, the, theory, that, god, granted, dominion, over, nature, to, man, through, adam, in, the, book, of, genesis, therefore, he, theorized, that, when, one, mixes, one, s, labor, with, nature, one, gains, a, relationship, with, that, part, of, nature, with, which, the, labor, is, mixed, subject, to, the, limitation, that, there, should, be, enough, and, as, good, left, in, common, for, others, see, lockean, proviso, in, his, encyclical, letter, rerum, novarum, 1891, pope, leo, xiii, wrote, it, is, surely, undeniable, that, when, a, man, engages, in, remunerative, labor, the, impelling, reason, and, motive, of, his, work, is, to, obtain, property, and, after, that, to, hold, it, as, his, very, own, anthropology, studies, the, diverse, ownership, systems, rights, of, use, and, transfer, and, possession, under, the, term, theories, of, property, as, mentioned, western, legal, theory, is, based, on, the, owner, of, property, being, a, legal, person, however, not, all, property, systems, are, founded, on, this, basis, in, every, culture, studied, ownership, and, possession, are, the, subjects, of, custom, and, regulation, and, law, is, where, the, term, can, meaningfully, be, applied, many, tribal, cultures, balance, individual, rights, with, the, laws, of, collective, groups, tribes, families, associations, and, nations, for, example, the, 1839, cherokee, constitution, frames, the, issue, in, these, terms, sec, 2, the, lands, of, the, cherokee, nation, shall, remain, common, property, still, the, improvements, made, thereon, and, in, possession, of, the, citizens, respectively, who, made, or, may, rightfully, own, them, provided, that, the, citizens, of, the, nation, possessing, the, exclusive, and, indefeasible, right, to, their, improvements, as, expressed, in, this, article, shall, possess, no, right, or, power, to, dispose, of, their, improvements, in, any, manner, whatever, to, the, united, states, individual, states, or, individual, citizens, thereof, and, that, whenever, any, citizen, shall, remove, with, his, effects, out, of, the, limits, of, this, nation, and, become, a, citizen, of, any, other, government, all, his, rights, and, privileges, as, a, citizen, of, this, nation, shall, cease, provided, nevertheless, that, the, national, council, shall, have, power, to, re, admit, by, law, to, all, the, rights, of, citizenship, any, such, person, or, persons, who, may, at, any, time, desire, to, return, to, the, nation, on, memorializing, the, national, council, for, such, readmission, communal, property, systems, describe, ownership, as, belonging, to, the, entire, social, and, political, unit, common, ownership, in, a, hypothetical, communist, society, is, distinguished, from, primitive, forms, of, common, property, that, have, existed, throughout, history, such, as, communalism, and, primitive, communism, in, that, communist, common, ownership, is, the, outcome, of, social, and, technological, developments, leading, to, the, elimination, of, material, scarcity, in, society, corporate, systems, describe, ownership, as, being, attached, to, an, identifiable, group, with, an, identifiable, responsible, individual, the, roman, property, law, was, based, on, such, a, corporate, system, in, a, well, known, paper, that, contributed, to, the, creation, of, the, field, of, law, and, economics, in, the, late, 1960s, the, american, scholar, harold, demsetz, described, how, the, concept, of, property, rights, makes, social, interactions, easier, in, the, world, of, robinson, crusoe, property, rights, play, no, role, property, rights, are, an, instrument, of, society, and, derive, their, significance, from, the, fact, that, they, help, a, man, form, those, expectations, which, he, can, reasonably, hold, in, his, dealings, with, others, these, expectations, find, expression, in, society, s, laws, customs, and, more, an, owner, of, property, rights, possesses, the, consent, of, fellowmen, to, allow, him, to, act, in, particular, ways, an, owner, expects, the, community, to, prevent, others, from, interfering, with, his, actions, provided, that, these, actions, are, not, prohibited, in, the, specifications, of, his, rights, different, societies, may, have, other, theories, of, property, for, differing, types, of, ownership, for, example, pauline, peters, argued, that, property, systems, are, not, isolable, from, the, social, fabric, and, notions, of, property, may, not, be, stated, as, such, but, instead, may, be, framed, in, negative, terms, for, example, the, taboo, system, among, polynesian, peoples, in, medieval, and, renaissance, europe, the, term, property, essentially, referred, to, land, after, much, rethinking, land, has, come, to, be, regarded, as, only, a, special, case, of, the, property, genus, this, rethinking, was, inspired, by, at, least, three, broad, features, of, early, modern, europe, the, surge, of, commerce, the, breakdown, of, efforts, to, prohibit, interest, then, called, usury, and, the, development, of, centralized, national, monarchies, urukagina, the, king, of, the, sumerian, city, state, lagash, established, the, first, laws, that, forbade, compelling, the, sale, of, property, the, bible, in, leviticus, 19, 11, and, ibid, 19, 13, states, that, the, israelites, are, not, to, steal, aristotle, in, politics, advocates, private, property, he, argues, that, self, interest, leads, to, neglect, of, the, commons, hat, which, is, common, to, the, greatest, number, has, the, least, care, bestowed, upon, it, everyone, thinks, chiefly, of, his, own, hardly, at, all, of, the, common, interest, and, only, when, he, is, himself, concerned, as, an, individual, in, addition, he, says, that, when, property, is, common, there, are, natural, problems, that, arise, due, to, differences, in, labor, if, they, do, not, share, equally, enjoyments, and, toils, those, who, labor, much, and, get, little, will, necessarily, complain, of, those, who, labor, little, and, receive, or, consume, much, but, indeed, there, is, always, a, difficulty, in, men, living, together, and, having, all, human, relations, in, common, but, especially, in, their, having, common, property, politics, 1261b34, cicero, held, that, there, is, no, private, property, under, natural, law, but, only, under, human, law, seneca, viewed, property, as, only, becoming, necessary, when, men, become, avaricious, st, ambrose, later, adopted, this, view, and, st, augustine, even, derided, heretics, for, complaining, the, emperor, could, not, confiscate, property, they, had, labored, for, the, canon, law, decretum, gratiani, maintained, that, mere, human, law, creates, property, repeating, the, phrases, used, by, st, augustine, st, thomas, aquinas, agreed, with, regard, to, the, private, consumption, of, property, but, modified, patristic, theory, in, finding, that, the, private, possession, of, property, is, necessary, thomas, aquinas, concludes, that, given, certain, detailed, provisions, the, principal, writings, of, thomas, hobbes, appeared, between, 1640, and, 1651, during, and, immediately, following, the, war, between, forces, loyal, to, king, charles, i, and, those, loyal, to, parliament, in, his, own, words, hobbes, reflection, began, with, the, idea, of, giving, to, every, man, his, own, a, phrase, he, drew, from, the, writings, of, cicero, but, he, wondered, how, can, anybody, call, anything, his, own, a, contemporary, of, hobbes, james, harrington, reacted, to, the, same, tumult, differently, he, considered, property, natural, but, not, inevitable, the, author, of, oceana, he, may, have, been, the, first, political, theorist, to, postulate, that, political, power, is, a, consequence, not, the, cause, of, the, distribution, of, property, he, said, that, the, worst, possible, situation, is, when, the, commoners, have, half, a, nation, s, property, with, the, crown, and, nobility, holding, the, other, half, a, circumstance, fraught, with, instability, and, violence, he, suggested, a, much, better, situation, a, stable, republic, would, exist, once, the, commoners, own, most, property, in, later, years, the, ranks, of, harrington, s, admirers, included, american, revolutionary, and, founder, john, adams, another, member, of, the, hobbes, harrington, generation, sir, robert, filmer, reached, conclusions, much, like, hobbes, but, through, biblical, exegesis, filmer, said, that, the, institution, of, kingship, is, analogous, to, that, of, fatherhood, that, subjects, are, still, children, whether, obedient, or, unruly, and, that, property, rights, are, akin, to, the, household, goods, that, a, father, may, dole, out, among, his, children, his, to, take, back, and, dispose, of, according, to, his, pleasure, in, the, following, generation, john, locke, sought, to, answer, filmer, creating, a, rationale, for, a, balanced, constitution, in, which, the, monarch, had, a, part, to, play, but, not, an, overwhelming, part, since, filmer, s, views, essentially, require, that, the, stuart, family, be, uniquely, descended, from, the, patriarchs, of, the, bible, and, even, in, the, late, 17th, century, that, was, a, difficult, view, to, uphold, locke, attacked, filmer, s, views, in, his, first, treatise, on, government, freeing, him, to, set, out, his, own, views, in, the, second, treatise, on, civil, government, therein, locke, imagined, a, pre, social, world, each, of, the, unhappy, residents, which, are, willing, to, create, a, social, contract, because, otherwise, the, enjoyment, of, the, property, he, has, in, this, state, is, very, unsafe, very, insecure, and, therefore, the, great, and, chief, end, therefore, of, men, s, uniting, into, commonwealths, and, putting, themselves, under, government, is, the, preservation, of, their, property, they, would, he, allowed, create, a, monarchy, but, its, task, would, be, to, execute, the, will, of, an, elected, legislature, to, this, end, to, achieve, the, previously, specified, goal, he, wrote, it, is, that, men, give, up, all, their, natural, power, to, the, society, they, enter, into, and, the, community, put, the, legislative, power, into, such, hands, as, they, think, fit, with, this, trust, that, they, shall, be, governed, by, declared, laws, or, else, their, peace, quiet, and, property, will, still, be, at, the, same, uncertainty, as, it, was, in, the, state, of, nature, even, when, it, keeps, to, proper, legislative, form, locke, held, that, there, are, limits, to, what, a, government, established, by, such, a, contract, might, rightly, do, it, cannot, be, supposed, that, they, should, intend, had, they, a, power, so, to, do, to, give, anyone, or, more, an, absolute, arbitrary, power, over, their, persons, and, estates, and, put, a, force, into, the, magistrate, s, hand, to, execute, his, unlimited, will, arbitrarily, upon, them, this, were, to, put, themselves, into, a, worse, condition, than, the, state, of, nature, wherein, they, had, a, liberty, to, defend, their, right, against, the, injuries, of, others, and, were, upon, equal, terms, of, force, to, maintain, it, whether, invaded, by, a, single, man, or, many, in, combination, whereas, by, supposing, they, have, given, themselves, up, to, the, absolute, arbitrary, power, and, will, of, a, legislator, they, have, disarmed, themselves, and, armed, him, to, make, a, prey, of, them, when, he, pleases, both, persons, and, estates, are, to, be, protected, from, the, arbitrary, power, of, any, magistrate, including, legislative, power, and, will, in, lockean, terms, depredations, against, an, estate, are, just, as, plausible, a, justification, for, resistance, and, revolution, as, are, those, against, persons, in, neither, case, are, subjects, required, to, allow, themselves, to, become, prey, to, explain, the, ownership, of, property, locke, advanced, a, labor, theory, of, property, in, contrast, to, the, figures, discussed, in, this, section, thus, far, david, hume, lived, a, relatively, quiet, life, that, had, settled, down, to, a, relatively, stable, social, and, political, structure, he, lived, the, life, of, a, solitary, writer, until, 1763, when, at, 52, years, of, age, he, went, off, to, paris, to, work, at, the, british, embassy, in, contrast, one, might, think, to, his, polemical, works, on, religion, and, his, empiricism, driven, skeptical, epistemology, hume, s, views, on, law, and, property, were, quite, conservative, he, did, not, believe, in, hypothetical, contracts, or, the, love, of, humanity, in, general, and, sought, to, ground, politics, upon, actual, human, beings, as, one, knows, them, in, general, he, wrote, it, may, be, affirmed, that, there, is, no, such, passion, in, the, human, mind, as, the, love, of, mankind, merely, as, such, independent, of, personal, qualities, or, services, or, of, relation, to, ourselves, existing, customs, should, not, lightly, be, disregarded, because, they, have, come, to, be, what, they, are, due, to, human, nature, with, this, endorsement, of, custom, comes, an, endorsement, of, existing, governments, because, he, conceived, of, the, two, as, complementary, a, regard, for, liberty, though, a, laudable, passion, ought, commonly, to, be, subordinate, to, a, reverence, for, established, government, therefore, hume, s, view, was, that, there, are, property, rights, because, of, and, to, the, extent, that, the, existing, law, supported, by, social, customs, secure, them, he, offered, some, practical, home, spun, advice, on, the, general, subject, though, as, when, he, referred, to, avarice, as, the, spur, of, industry, and, expressed, concern, about, excessive, levels, of, taxation, which, destroy, industry, by, engendering, despair, civil, government, so, far, as, it, is, instituted, for, the, security, of, property, is, in, reality, instituted, for, the, defense, of, the, rich, against, the, poor, or, of, those, who, have, property, against, those, who, have, none, at, all, the, property, that, every, man, has, in, his, labour, is, the, original, foundation, of, all, other, property, so, it, is, the, most, sacred, and, inviolable, the, inheritance, of, a, poor, man, lies, in, the, strength, and, dexterity, of, his, hands, and, to, hinder, him, from, employing, this, strength, and, dexterity, in, what, manner, he, thinks, proper, without, injury, to, his, neighbor, is, a, plain, violation, of, this, most, sacred, property, it, is, a, manifest, encroachment, upon, the, just, liberty, of, the, workman, and, those, who, might, be, disposed, to, employ, him, it, hinders, the, one, from, working, at, what, he, thinks, proper, so, it, hinders, the, others, from, employing, whom, they, think, proper, to, judge, whether, he, is, fit, to, be, employed, may, surely, be, trusted, to, the, discretion, of, the, employers, whose, interest, it, so, much, concerns, the, affected, anxiety, of, the, law, giver, lest, they, should, employ, an, improper, person, is, as, impertinent, as, it, is, oppressive, source, adam, smith, the, wealth, of, nations, 1776, book, i, chapter, x, part, ii, by, the, mid, 19th, century, the, industrial, revolution, had, transformed, england, and, the, united, states, and, had, begun, in, france, as, a, result, the, conventional, conception, of, what, constitutes, property, expanded, beyond, land, to, encompass, scarce, goods, in, france, the, revolution, of, the, 1790s, had, led, to, large, scale, confiscation, of, land, formerly, owned, by, the, church, and, king, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, led, to, claims, by, those, dispossessed, to, have, their, former, lands, returned, section, viii, primitive, accumulation, of, capital, involves, a, critique, of, liberal, theories, of, property, rights, marx, notes, that, under, feudal, law, peasants, were, legally, entitled, to, their, land, as, the, aristocracy, was, to, its, manors, marx, cites, several, historical, events, in, which, large, numbers, of, the, peasantry, were, removed, from, their, lands, then, seized, by, the, nobility, this, seized, land, was, then, used, for, commercial, ventures, sheep, herding, marx, sees, this, primitive, accumulation, as, integral, to, the, creation, of, english, capitalism, this, event, created, a, sizeable, un, landed, class, that, had, to, work, for, wages, to, survive, marx, asserts, that, liberal, theories, of, property, are, idyllic, fairy, tales, that, hide, a, violent, historical, process, charles, comte, in, trait, de, la, propri, t, 1834, attempted, to, justify, the, legitimacy, of, private, property, in, response, to, the, bourbon, restoration, according, to, david, hart, comte, had, three, main, points, firstly, that, interference, by, the, state, over, the, centuries, in, property, ownership, has, had, dire, consequences, for, justice, as, well, as, for, economic, productivity, secondly, that, property, is, legitimate, when, it, emerges, in, such, a, way, as, not, to, harm, anyone, and, thirdly, that, historically, some, but, by, no, means, all, property, which, has, evolved, has, done, so, legitimately, with, the, implication, that, the, present, distribution, of, property, is, a, complex, mixture, of, legitimately, and, illegitimately, held, titles, comte, as, proudhon, later, did, rejected, roman, legal, tradition, with, its, toleration, of, slavery, instead, he, posited, a, communal, national, property, consisting, of, non, scarce, goods, such, as, land, in, ancient, hunter, gatherer, societies, since, agriculture, was, so, much, more, efficient, than, hunting, and, gathering, private, property, appropriated, by, someone, for, farming, left, remaining, hunter, gatherers, with, more, land, per, person, and, hence, did, not, harm, them, thus, this, type, of, land, appropriation, did, not, violate, the, lockean, proviso, there, was, still, enough, and, as, good, left, later, theorists, would, use, comte, s, analysis, in, response, to, the, socialist, critique, of, property, in, his, 1840, treatise, what, is, property, pierre, proudhon, answers, with, property, is, theft, in, natural, resources, he, sees, two, types, of, property, de, jure, property, legal, title, and, de, facto, property, physical, possession, and, argues, that, the, former, is, illegitimate, proudhon, s, conclusion, is, that, property, to, be, just, and, possible, must, necessarily, have, equality, for, its, condition, his, analysis, of, the, product, of, labor, upon, natural, resources, as, property, usufruct, is, more, nuanced, he, asserts, that, land, itself, cannot, be, property, yet, it, should, be, held, by, individual, possessors, as, stewards, of, humanity, with, the, product, of, labor, being, the, producer, s, property, proudhon, reasoned, that, any, wealth, gained, without, labor, was, stolen, from, those, who, labored, to, create, that, wealth, even, a, voluntary, contract, to, surrender, the, product, of, work, to, an, employer, was, theft, according, to, proudhon, since, the, controller, of, natural, resources, had, no, moral, right, to, charge, others, for, the, use, of, that, which, he, did, not, labor, to, create, did, not, own, proudhon, s, theory, of, property, greatly, influenced, the, budding, socialist, movement, inspiring, anarchist, theorists, such, as, mikhail, bakunin, who, modified, proudhon, s, ideas, as, well, as, antagonizing, theorists, like, karl, marx, fr, d, ric, bastiat, s, main, treatise, on, property, can, be, found, in, chapter, 8, of, his, book, economic, harmonies, 1850, in, a, radical, departure, from, traditional, property, theory, he, defines, property, not, as, a, physical, object, but, rather, as, a, relationship, between, people, concerning, a, thing, thus, saying, one, owns, a, glass, of, water, is, merely, verbal, shorthand, for, i, may, justly, gift, or, trade, this, water, to, another, person, in, essence, what, one, owns, is, not, the, object, but, the, object, s, value, by, value, bastiat, means, market, value, he, emphasizes, this, is, quite, different, from, utility, in, our, relations, with, one, another, we, are, not, owners, of, the, utility, of, things, but, their, value, and, value, is, the, appraisal, made, of, reciprocal, services, bastiat, theorized, that, as, a, result, of, technological, progress, and, the, division, of, labor, the, stock, of, communal, wealth, increases, over, time, that, the, hours, of, work, an, unskilled, laborer, expends, to, buy, e, g, 100, liters, of, wheat, decreases, over, time, thus, amounting, to, gratis, satisfaction, thus, private, property, continually, destroys, itself, becoming, transformed, into, communal, wealth, the, increasing, proportion, of, communal, wealth, to, private, property, results, in, a, tendency, toward, equality, of, humanity, since, the, human, race, began, in, greatest, poverty, that, is, when, there, were, the, most, obstacles, to, overcome, all, that, has, been, achieved, from, one, era, to, the, next, is, due, to, the, spirit, of, property, this, transformation, of, private, property, into, the, communal, domain, bastiat, points, out, does, not, imply, that, personal, property, will, ever, totally, disappear, on, the, contrary, this, is, because, man, as, he, progresses, continually, invents, new, and, more, sophisticated, needs, and, desires, andrew, j, galambos, 1924, 1997, was, an, astrophysicist, and, philosopher, who, innovated, a, social, structure, that, sought, to, maximize, human, peace, and, freedom, galambos, concept, of, property, was, essential, to, his, philosophy, he, defined, property, as, a, man, s, life, and, all, non, procreative, derivatives, of, his, life, because, the, english, language, is, deficient, in, omitting, the, feminine, from, man, when, referring, to, humankind, it, is, implicit, and, obligatory, that, the, feminine, is, included, in, the, term, man, galambos, taught, that, property, is, essential, to, a, non, coercive, social, structure, he, defined, freedom, as, follows, freedom, is, the, societal, condition, that, exists, when, every, individual, has, full, 100, control, over, his, property, galambos, defines, property, as, having, the, following, elements, property, includes, all, non, procreative, derivatives, of, an, individual, s, life, this, means, children, are, not, the, property, of, their, parents, and, primary, property, a, person, s, own, ideas, galambos, repeatedly, emphasized, that, actual, government, exists, to, protect, property, and, that, the, state, attacks, property, for, example, the, state, requires, payment, for, its, services, in, the, form, of, taxes, whether, or, not, people, desire, such, services, since, an, individual, s, money, is, his, property, the, confiscation, of, money, in, the, form, of, taxes, is, an, attack, on, property, military, conscription, is, likewise, an, attack, on, a, person, s, primordial, property, contemporary, political, thinkers, who, believe, that, natural, persons, enjoy, rights, to, own, property, and, enter, into, contracts, espouse, two, views, about, john, locke, on, the, one, hand, some, admire, locke, such, as, william, h, hutt, 1956, who, praised, locke, for, laying, down, the, quintessence, of, individualism, on, the, other, hand, those, such, as, richard, pipes, regard, locke, s, arguments, as, weak, and, think, that, undue, reliance, thereon, has, weakened, the, cause, of, individualism, in, recent, times, pipes, has, written, that, locke, s, work, marked, a, regression, because, it, rested, on, the, concept, of, natural, law, rather, than, upon, harrington, s, sociological, framework, hernando, de, soto, has, argued, that, an, essential, characteristic, of, the, capitalist, market, economy, is, the, functioning, state, protection, of, property, rights, in, a, formal, property, system, which, records, ownership, and, transactions, these, property, rights, and, the, whole, legal, system, of, property, make, possible, according, to, de, soto, all, of, the, above, enhance, economic, growth, academics, have, criticized, the, capitalist, frame, through, which, property, is, viewed, pointing, to, the, fact, that, commodifying, property, or, land, by, assigning, it, monetary, value, takes, away, from, the, traditional, cultural, heritage, particularly, from, first, nation, inhabitants, these, academics, point, to, the, personal, nature, of, property, and, its, link, to, identity, being, irreconcilable, with, wealth, creation, that, contemporary, western, society, subscribes, to, property, giving, legal, property, taking, legal, property, taking, illegal
