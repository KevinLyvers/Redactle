information, is, an, abstract, concept, that, refers, to, something, which, has, the, power, to, inform, at, the, most, fundamental, level, it, pertains, to, the, interpretation, perhaps, formally, of, that, which, may, be, sensed, or, their, abstractions, any, natural, process, that, is, not, completely, random, and, any, observable, pattern, in, any, medium, can, be, said, to, convey, some, amount, of, information, whereas, digital, signals, and, other, data, use, discrete, signs, to, convey, information, other, phenomena, and, artifacts, such, as, analogue, signals, poems, pictures, music, or, other, sounds, and, currents, convey, information, in, a, more, continuous, form, information, is, not, knowledge, itself, but, the, meaning, that, may, be, derived, from, a, representation, through, interpretation, the, concept, of, information, is, relevant, or, connected, to, various, concepts, including, constraint, communication, control, data, form, education, knowledge, meaning, understanding, mental, stimuli, pattern, perception, proposition, representation, and, entropy, information, is, often, processed, iteratively, data, available, at, one, step, are, processed, into, information, to, be, interpreted, and, processed, at, the, next, step, for, example, in, written, text, each, symbol, or, letter, conveys, information, relevant, to, the, word, it, is, part, of, each, word, conveys, information, relevant, to, the, phrase, it, is, part, of, each, phrase, conveys, information, relevant, to, the, sentence, it, is, part, of, and, so, on, until, at, the, final, step, information, is, interpreted, and, becomes, knowledge, in, a, given, domain, in, a, digital, signal, bits, may, be, interpreted, into, the, symbols, letters, numbers, or, structures, that, convey, the, information, available, at, the, next, level, up, the, key, characteristic, of, information, is, that, it, is, subject, to, interpretation, and, processing, the, derivation, of, information, from, a, signal, or, message, may, be, thought, of, as, the, resolution, of, ambiguity, or, uncertainty, that, arises, during, the, interpretation, of, patterns, within, the, signal, or, message, information, may, be, structured, as, data, redundant, data, can, be, compressed, up, to, an, optimal, size, which, is, the, theoretical, limit, of, compression, the, information, available, through, a, collection, of, data, may, be, derived, by, analysis, for, example, a, restaurant, collects, data, from, every, customer, order, that, information, may, be, analyzed, to, produce, knowledge, that, is, put, to, use, when, the, business, subsequently, wants, to, identify, the, most, popular, or, least, popular, dish, information, can, be, transmitted, in, time, via, data, storage, and, space, via, communication, and, telecommunication, information, is, expressed, either, as, the, content, of, a, message, or, through, direct, or, indirect, observation, that, which, is, perceived, can, be, construed, as, a, message, in, its, own, right, and, in, that, sense, all, information, is, always, conveyed, as, the, content, of, a, message, information, can, be, encoded, into, various, forms, for, transmission, and, interpretation, for, example, information, may, be, encoded, into, a, sequence, of, signs, or, transmitted, via, a, signal, it, can, also, be, encrypted, for, safe, storage, and, communication, the, uncertainty, of, an, event, is, measured, by, its, probability, of, occurrence, uncertainty, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, probability, of, occurrence, information, theory, takes, advantage, of, this, by, concluding, that, more, uncertain, events, require, more, information, to, resolve, their, uncertainty, the, bit, is, a, typical, unit, of, information, it, is, that, which, reduces, uncertainty, by, half, other, units, such, as, the, nat, may, be, used, for, example, the, information, encoded, in, one, fair, coin, flip, is, log, 2, 2, 1, 1, bit, and, in, two, fair, coin, flips, is, log, 2, 4, 1, 2, bits, a, 2011, science, article, estimates, that, 97, of, technologically, stored, information, was, already, in, digital, bits, in, 2007, and, that, the, year, 2002, was, the, beginning, of, the, digital, age, for, information, storage, with, digital, storage, capacity, bypassing, analogue, for, the, first, time, information, can, be, defined, exactly, by, set, theory, information, is, a, selection, from, the, domain, of, information, the, domain, of, information, is, a, set, that, the, sender, and, receiver, of, information, must, know, before, exchanging, information, digital, information, for, example, consists, of, building, blocks, that, are, all, number, sequences, each, number, sequence, represents, a, selection, from, its, domain, the, sender, and, receiver, of, digital, information, number, sequences, must, know, the, domain, and, binary, format, of, each, number, sequence, before, exchanging, information, by, defining, number, sequences, online, this, would, be, systematically, and, universally, usable, before, the, exchanged, digital, number, sequence, an, efficient, unique, link, to, its, online, definition, can, be, set, this, online, defined, digital, information, number, sequence, would, be, globally, comparable, and, globally, searchable, the, english, word, information, comes, from, middle, french, enformacion, informacion, information, a, criminal, investigation, and, its, etymon, latin, informati, n, conception, teaching, creation, in, english, information, is, an, uncountable, mass, noun, information, theory, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, quantification, storage, and, communication, of, information, the, field, was, fundamentally, established, by, the, works, of, harry, nyquist, and, ralph, hartley, in, the, 1920s, and, claude, shannon, in, the, 1940s, the, field, is, at, the, intersection, of, probability, theory, statistics, computer, science, statistical, mechanics, information, engineering, and, electrical, engineering, a, key, measure, in, information, theory, is, entropy, entropy, quantifies, the, amount, of, uncertainty, involved, in, the, value, of, a, random, variable, or, the, outcome, of, a, random, process, for, example, identifying, the, outcome, of, a, fair, coin, flip, with, two, equally, likely, outcomes, provides, less, information, lower, entropy, than, specifying, the, outcome, from, a, roll, of, a, die, with, six, equally, likely, outcomes, some, other, important, measures, in, information, theory, are, mutual, information, channel, capacity, error, exponents, and, relative, entropy, important, sub, fields, of, information, theory, include, source, coding, algorithmic, complexity, theory, algorithmic, information, theory, and, information, theoretic, security, applications, of, fundamental, topics, of, information, theory, include, source, coding, data, compression, e, g, for, zip, files, and, channel, coding, error, detection, and, correction, e, g, for, dsl, its, impact, has, been, crucial, to, the, success, of, the, voyager, missions, to, deep, space, the, invention, of, the, compact, disc, the, feasibility, of, mobile, phones, and, the, development, of, the, internet, the, theory, has, also, found, applications, in, other, areas, including, statistical, inference, cryptography, neurobiology, perception, linguistics, the, evolution, and, function, of, molecular, codes, bioinformatics, thermal, physics, quantum, computing, black, holes, information, retrieval, intelligence, gathering, plagiarism, detection, pattern, recognition, anomaly, detection, and, even, art, creation, often, information, can, be, viewed, as, a, type, of, input, to, an, organism, or, system, inputs, are, of, two, kinds, some, inputs, are, important, to, the, function, of, the, organism, for, example, food, or, system, energy, by, themselves, in, his, book, sensory, ecology, biophysicist, david, b, dusenbery, called, these, causal, inputs, other, inputs, information, are, important, only, because, they, are, associated, with, causal, inputs, and, can, be, used, to, predict, the, occurrence, of, a, causal, input, at, a, later, time, and, perhaps, another, place, some, information, is, important, because, of, association, with, other, information, but, eventually, there, must, be, a, connection, to, a, causal, input, in, practice, information, is, usually, carried, by, weak, stimuli, that, must, be, detected, by, specialized, sensory, systems, and, amplified, by, energy, inputs, before, they, can, be, functional, to, the, organism, or, system, for, example, light, is, mainly, but, not, only, e, g, plants, can, grow, in, the, direction, of, the, light, source, a, causal, input, to, plants, but, for, animals, it, only, provides, information, the, colored, light, reflected, from, a, flower, is, too, weak, for, photosynthesis, but, the, visual, system, of, the, bee, detects, it, and, the, bee, s, nervous, system, uses, the, information, to, guide, the, bee, to, the, flower, where, the, bee, often, finds, nectar, or, pollen, which, are, causal, inputs, a, nutritional, function, the, cognitive, scientist, and, applied, mathematician, ronaldo, vigo, argues, that, information, is, a, concept, that, requires, at, least, two, related, entities, to, make, quantitative, sense, these, are, any, dimensionally, defined, category, of, objects, s, and, any, of, its, subsets, r, r, in, essence, is, a, representation, of, s, or, in, other, words, conveys, representational, and, hence, conceptual, information, about, s, vigo, then, defines, the, amount, of, information, that, r, conveys, about, s, as, the, rate, of, change, in, the, complexity, of, s, whenever, the, objects, in, r, are, removed, from, s, under, vigo, information, pattern, invariance, complexity, representation, and, information, five, fundamental, constructs, of, universal, science, are, unified, under, a, novel, mathematical, framework, among, other, things, the, framework, aims, to, overcome, the, limitations, of, shannon, weaver, information, when, attempting, to, characterize, and, measure, subjective, information, michael, grieves, has, proposed, that, the, focus, on, information, should, be, what, it, does, as, opposed, to, defining, what, it, is, grieves, has, proposed, that, information, can, be, substituted, for, wasted, physical, resources, time, energy, and, material, for, goal, oriented, tasks, goal, oriented, tasks, can, be, divided, into, two, components, the, most, cost, efficient, use, of, physical, resources, time, energy, and, material, and, the, additional, use, of, physical, resources, used, by, the, task, this, second, category, is, by, definition, wasted, physical, resources, information, does, not, substitute, or, replace, the, most, cost, efficient, use, of, physical, resources, but, can, be, used, to, replace, the, wasted, physical, resources, the, condition, that, this, occurs, under, is, that, the, cost, of, information, is, less, than, the, cost, of, the, wasted, physical, resources, since, information, is, a, non, rival, good, this, can, be, especially, beneficial, for, repeatable, tasks, in, manufacturing, the, task, category, of, the, most, cost, efficient, use, of, physical, resources, is, called, lean, manufacturing, information, is, any, type, of, pattern, that, influences, the, formation, or, transformation, of, other, patterns, in, this, sense, there, is, no, need, for, a, conscious, mind, to, perceive, much, less, appreciate, the, pattern, consider, for, example, dna, the, sequence, of, nucleotides, is, a, pattern, that, influences, the, formation, and, development, of, an, organism, without, any, need, for, a, conscious, mind, one, might, argue, though, that, for, a, human, to, consciously, define, a, pattern, for, example, a, nucleotide, naturally, involves, conscious, information, processing, however, the, existence, of, unicellular, and, multicellular, organisms, with, the, complex, biochemistry, that, leads, among, other, events, to, the, existence, of, enzymes, and, polynucleotides, that, interact, maintaining, the, biological, order, and, participating, in, the, development, of, multicellular, organisms, precedes, by, millions, of, years, the, emergence, of, human, consciousness, and, the, creation, of, the, scientific, culture, that, produced, the, chemical, nomenclature, systems, theory, at, times, seems, to, refer, to, information, in, this, sense, assuming, information, does, not, necessarily, involve, any, conscious, mind, and, patterns, circulating, due, to, feedback, in, the, system, can, be, called, information, in, other, words, it, can, be, said, that, information, in, this, sense, is, something, potentially, perceived, as, representation, though, not, created, or, presented, for, that, purpose, for, example, gregory, bateson, defines, information, as, a, difference, that, makes, a, difference, if, however, the, premise, of, influence, implies, that, information, has, been, perceived, by, a, conscious, mind, and, also, interpreted, by, it, the, specific, context, associated, with, this, interpretation, may, cause, the, transformation, of, the, information, into, knowledge, complex, definitions, of, both, information, and, knowledge, make, such, semantic, and, logical, analysis, difficult, but, the, condition, of, transformation, is, an, important, point, in, the, study, of, information, as, it, relates, to, knowledge, especially, in, the, business, discipline, of, knowledge, management, in, this, practice, tools, and, processes, are, used, to, assist, a, knowledge, worker, in, performing, research, and, making, decisions, including, steps, such, as, stewart, 2001, argues, that, transformation, of, information, into, knowledge, is, critical, lying, at, the, core, of, value, creation, and, competitive, advantage, for, the, modern, enterprise, in, a, biological, framework, mizraji, has, described, information, as, an, entity, emerging, from, the, interaction, of, patterns, with, receptor, systems, eg, in, molecular, or, neural, receptors, capable, of, interacting, with, specific, patterns, information, emerges, from, those, interactions, in, addition, he, has, incorporated, the, idea, of, information, catalysts, structures, where, emerging, information, promotes, the, transition, from, pattern, recognition, to, goal, directed, action, for, example, the, specific, transformation, of, a, substrate, into, a, product, by, an, enzyme, or, auditory, reception, of, words, and, the, production, of, an, oral, response, the, danish, dictionary, of, information, terms, argues, that, information, only, provides, an, answer, to, a, posed, question, whether, the, answer, provides, knowledge, depends, on, the, informed, person, so, a, generalized, definition, of, the, concept, should, be, information, an, answer, to, a, specific, question, when, marshall, mcluhan, speaks, of, media, and, their, effects, on, human, cultures, he, refers, to, the, structure, of, artifacts, that, in, turn, shape, our, behaviors, and, mindsets, also, pheromones, are, often, said, to, be, information, in, this, sense, these, sections, are, using, measurements, of, data, rather, than, information, as, information, cannot, be, directly, measured, it, is, estimated, that, the, world, s, technological, capacity, to, store, information, grew, from, 2, 6, optimally, compressed, exabytes, in, 1986, which, is, the, informational, equivalent, to, less, than, one, 730, mb, cd, rom, per, person, 539, mb, per, person, to, 295, optimally, compressed, exabytes, in, 2007, this, is, the, informational, equivalent, of, almost, 61, cd, rom, per, person, in, 2007, the, world, s, combined, technological, capacity, to, receive, information, through, one, way, broadcast, networks, was, the, informational, equivalent, of, 174, newspapers, per, person, per, day, in, 2007, the, world, s, combined, effective, capacity, to, exchange, information, through, two, way, telecommunication, networks, was, the, informational, equivalent, of, 6, newspapers, per, person, per, day, in, 2007, as, of, 2007, an, estimated, 90, of, all, new, information, is, digital, mostly, stored, on, hard, drives, the, total, amount, of, data, created, captured, copied, and, consumed, globally, is, forecast, to, increase, rapidly, reaching, 64, 2, zettabytes, in, 2020, over, the, next, five, years, up, to, 2025, global, data, creation, is, projected, to, grow, to, more, than, 180, zettabytes, records, are, specialized, forms, of, information, essentially, records, are, information, produced, consciously, or, as, by, products, of, business, activities, or, transactions, and, retained, because, of, their, value, primarily, their, value, is, as, evidence, of, the, activities, of, the, organization, but, they, may, also, be, retained, for, their, informational, value, sound, records, management, ensures, that, the, integrity, of, records, is, preserved, for, as, long, as, they, are, required, the, international, standard, on, records, management, iso, 15489, defines, records, as, information, created, received, and, maintained, as, evidence, and, information, by, an, organization, or, person, in, pursuance, of, legal, obligations, or, in, the, transaction, of, business, the, international, committee, on, archives, ica, committee, on, electronic, records, defined, a, record, as, recorded, information, produced, or, received, in, the, initiation, conduct, or, completion, of, an, institutional, or, individual, activity, and, that, comprises, content, context, and, structure, sufficient, to, provide, evidence, of, the, activity, records, may, be, maintained, to, retain, corporate, memory, of, the, organization, or, to, meet, legal, fiscal, or, accountability, requirements, imposed, on, the, organization, willis, expressed, the, view, that, sound, management, of, business, records, and, information, delivered, six, key, requirements, for, good, corporate, governance, transparency, accountability, due, process, compliance, meeting, statutory, and, common, law, requirements, and, security, of, personal, and, corporate, information, michael, buckland, has, classified, information, in, terms, of, its, uses, information, as, process, information, as, knowledge, and, information, as, thing, beynon, davies, explains, the, multi, faceted, concept, of, information, in, terms, of, signs, and, signal, sign, systems, signs, themselves, can, be, considered, in, terms, of, four, inter, dependent, levels, layers, or, branches, of, semiotics, pragmatics, semantics, syntax, and, empirics, these, four, layers, serve, to, connect, the, social, world, on, the, one, hand, with, the, physical, or, technical, world, on, the, other, pragmatics, is, concerned, with, the, purpose, of, communication, pragmatics, links, the, issue, of, signs, with, the, context, within, which, signs, are, used, the, focus, of, pragmatics, is, on, the, intentions, of, living, agents, underlying, communicative, behaviour, in, other, words, pragmatics, link, language, to, action, semantics, is, concerned, with, the, meaning, of, a, message, conveyed, in, a, communicative, act, semantics, considers, the, content, of, communication, semantics, is, the, study, of, the, meaning, of, signs, the, association, between, signs, and, behaviour, semantics, can, be, considered, as, the, study, of, the, link, between, symbols, and, their, referents, or, concepts, particularly, the, way, that, signs, relate, to, human, behavior, syntax, is, concerned, with, the, formalism, used, to, represent, a, message, syntax, as, an, area, studies, the, form, of, communication, in, terms, of, the, logic, and, grammar, of, sign, systems, syntax, is, devoted, to, the, study, of, the, form, rather, than, the, content, of, signs, and, sign, systems, nielsen, 2008, discusses, the, relationship, between, semiotics, and, information, in, relation, to, dictionaries, he, introduces, the, concept, of, lexicographic, information, costs, and, refers, to, the, effort, a, user, of, a, dictionary, must, make, to, first, find, and, then, understand, data, so, that, they, can, generate, information, communication, normally, exists, within, the, context, of, some, social, situation, the, social, situation, sets, the, context, for, the, intentions, conveyed, pragmatics, and, the, form, of, communication, in, a, communicative, situation, intentions, are, expressed, through, messages, that, comprise, collections, of, inter, related, signs, taken, from, a, language, mutually, understood, by, the, agents, involved, in, the, communication, mutual, understanding, implies, that, agents, involved, understand, the, chosen, language, in, terms, of, its, agreed, syntax, and, semantics, the, sender, codes, the, message, in, the, language, and, sends, the, message, as, signals, along, some, communication, channel, empirics, the, chosen, communication, channel, has, inherent, properties, that, determine, outcomes, such, as, the, speed, at, which, communication, can, take, place, and, over, what, distance, the, existence, of, information, about, a, closed, system, is, a, major, concept, in, both, classical, physics, and, quantum, mechanics, encompassing, the, ability, real, or, theoretical, of, an, agent, to, predict, the, future, state, of, a, system, based, on, knowledge, gathered, during, its, past, and, present, determinism, is, a, philosophical, theory, holding, that, causal, determination, can, predict, all, future, events, positing, a, fully, predictable, universe, described, by, classical, physicist, pierre, simon, laplace, as, the, effect, of, its, past, and, the, cause, of, its, future, quantum, physics, instead, encodes, information, as, a, wave, function, which, prevents, observers, from, directly, identifying, all, of, its, possible, measurements, prior, to, the, publication, of, bell, s, theorem, determinists, reconciled, with, this, behavior, using, hidden, variable, theories, which, argued, that, the, information, necessary, to, predict, the, future, of, a, function, must, exist, even, if, it, is, not, accessible, for, humans, a, view, surmised, by, albert, einstein, with, the, assertion, that, god, does, not, play, dice, modern, astronomy, cites, the, mechanical, sense, of, information, in, the, black, hole, information, paradox, positing, that, because, the, complete, evaporation, of, a, black, hole, into, hawking, radiation, leaves, nothing, except, an, expanding, cloud, of, homogeneous, particles, this, results, in, the, irrecoverability, of, any, information, about, the, matter, to, have, originally, crossed, the, event, horizon, violating, both, classical, and, quantum, assertions, against, the, ability, to, destroy, information, the, information, cycle, addressed, as, a, whole, or, in, its, distinct, components, is, of, great, concern, to, information, technology, information, systems, as, well, as, information, science, these, fields, deal, with, those, processes, and, techniques, pertaining, to, information, capture, through, sensors, and, generation, through, computation, formulation, or, composition, processing, including, encoding, encryption, compression, packaging, transmission, including, all, telecommunication, methods, presentation, including, visualization, display, methods, storage, such, as, magnetic, or, optical, including, holographic, methods, etc, information, visualization, shortened, as, infovis, depends,
