organized, crime, is, a, category, of, transnational, national, or, local, group, of, centralized, enterprises, run, to, engage, in, illegal, activity, most, commonly, for, profit, while, organized, crime, is, generally, thought, of, as, a, form, of, illegal, business, some, criminal, organizations, such, as, terrorist, groups, rebel, forces, and, separatists, are, politically, motivated, many, criminal, organizations, rely, on, fear, or, terror, to, achieve, their, goals, or, aims, as, well, as, to, maintain, control, within, the, organization, and, may, adopt, tactics, commonly, used, by, authoritarian, regimes, to, maintain, power, some, forms, of, organized, crime, simply, exist, to, cater, towards, demand, of, illegal, goods, in, a, state, or, to, facilitate, trade, of, goods, and, services, that, may, have, been, banned, by, a, state, such, as, illegal, drugs, or, firearms, sometimes, criminal, organizations, force, people, to, do, business, with, them, such, as, when, a, gang, extorts, protection, money, from, shopkeepers, street, gangs, may, often, be, deemed, organized, crime, groups, or, under, stricter, definitions, of, organized, crime, may, become, disciplined, enough, to, be, considered, organized, a, criminal, organization, can, also, be, referred, to, as, an, outfit, a, gang, crime, family, mafia, mob, crime, ring, or, syndicate, the, network, subculture, and, community, of, criminals, involved, in, organized, crime, may, be, referred, to, as, the, underworld, or, gangland, sociologists, sometimes, specifically, distinguish, a, mafia, as, a, type, of, organized, crime, group, that, specializes, in, the, supply, of, extra, legal, protection, and, quasi, law, enforcement, academic, studies, of, the, original, mafia, the, italian, mafia, as, well, as, its, american, counterpart, generated, an, economic, study, of, organized, crime, groups, and, exerted, great, influence, on, studies, of, the, russian, mafia, the, chinese, triads, the, hong, kong, triads, and, the, japanese, yakuza, other, organizations, including, states, churches, militaries, police, forces, and, corporations, may, sometimes, use, organized, crime, methods, to, conduct, their, activities, but, their, powers, derive, from, their, status, as, formal, social, institutions, there, is, a, tendency, to, distinguish, traditional, organized, crime, such, as, gambling, loan, sharking, drug, trafficking, prostitution, and, fraud, from, certain, other, forms, of, crime, that, also, usually, involve, organized, or, group, criminal, acts, such, as, white, collar, crime, financial, crimes, political, crimes, war, crimes, state, crimes, and, treason, this, distinction, is, not, always, apparent, and, academics, continue, to, debate, the, matter, for, example, in, failed, states, that, can, no, longer, perform, basic, functions, such, as, education, security, or, governance, usually, due, to, fractious, violence, or, to, extreme, poverty, organized, crime, governance, and, war, sometimes, complement, each, other, the, term, oligarchy, has, been, used, to, describe, democratic, countries, whose, political, social, and, economic, institutions, come, under, the, control, of, a, few, families, and, business, oligarchs, that, may, be, deemed, or, may, devolve, into, organized, crime, groups, in, practice, by, their, very, nature, kleptocracies, mafia, states, narco, states, or, narcokleptocracies, and, states, with, high, levels, of, clientelism, and, political, corruption, are, either, heavily, involved, with, organized, crime, or, tend, to, foster, organized, crime, within, their, own, governments, in, the, united, states, the, organized, crime, control, act, 1970, defines, organized, crime, as, he, unlawful, activities, of, a, highly, organized, disciplined, association, criminal, activity, as, a, structured, process, is, referred, to, as, racketeering, in, the, uk, police, estimate, that, organized, crime, involves, up, to, 38, 000, people, operating, in, 6, 000, various, groups, historically, the, largest, organized, crime, force, in, the, united, states, has, been, cosa, nostra, italian, american, mafia, but, other, transnational, criminal, organizations, have, also, risen, in, prominence, in, recent, decades, a, 2012, article, in, a, u, s, department, of, justice, journal, stated, that, since, the, end, of, the, cold, war, organized, crime, groups, from, russia, china, italy, nigeria, and, japan, have, increased, their, international, presence, and, worldwide, networks, or, have, become, involved, in, more, transnational, criminal, activities, most, of, the, world, s, major, international, organized, crime, groups, are, present, in, the, united, states, the, us, drug, enforcement, administration, s, 2017, national, drug, threat, assessment, classified, mexican, transnational, criminal, organizations, tcos, as, the, greatest, criminal, drug, threat, to, the, united, states, citing, their, dominance, over, large, regions, in, mexico, used, for, the, cultivation, production, importation, and, transportation, of, illicit, drugs, and, identifying, the, sinaloa, jalisco, new, generation, ju, rez, gulf, los, zetas, and, beltr, n, leyva, cartels, as, the, six, mexican, tco, with, the, greatest, influence, in, drug, trafficking, to, the, united, states, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 16, has, a, target, to, combat, all, forms, of, organized, crime, as, part, of, the, 2030, agenda, in, some, countries, football, hooliganism, has, been, linked, to, organized, crime, various, models, have, been, proposed, to, describe, the, structure, of, criminal, organizations, patron, client, networks, are, defined, by, fluid, interactions, they, produce, crime, groups, that, operate, as, smaller, units, within, the, overall, network, and, as, such, tend, towards, valuing, significant, others, familiarity, of, social, and, economic, environments, or, tradition, these, networks, are, usually, composed, of, bureaucratic, corporate, organized, crime, groups, are, defined, by, the, general, rigidity, of, their, internal, structures, they, focus, more, on, how, the, operations, works, succeeds, sustains, itself, or, avoids, retribution, they, are, generally, typified, by, however, this, model, of, operation, has, some, flaws, while, bureaucratic, operations, emphasize, business, processes, and, strongly, authoritarian, hierarchies, these, are, based, on, enforcing, power, relationships, rather, than, an, overlying, aim, of, protectionism, sustainability, or, growth, an, estimate, on, youth, street, gangs, in, the, united, states, provided, by, hannigan, et, al, marked, an, increase, of, 35, between, 2002, and, 2010, a, distinctive, gang, culture, underpins, many, but, not, all, organized, groups, this, may, develop, through, recruiting, strategies, social, learning, processes, in, the, corrective, system, experienced, by, youth, family, or, peer, involvement, in, crime, and, the, coercive, actions, of, criminal, authority, figures, the, term, street, gang, is, commonly, used, interchangeably, with, youth, gang, referring, to, neighborhood, or, street, based, youth, groups, that, meet, gang, criteria, miller, 1992, defines, a, street, gang, as, a, self, formed, association, of, peers, united, by, mutual, interests, with, identifiable, leadership, and, internal, organization, who, act, collectively, or, as, individuals, to, achieve, specific, purposes, including, the, conduct, of, illegal, activity, and, control, of, a, particular, territory, facility, or, enterprise, some, reasons, youth, join, gangs, include, to, feel, accepted, attain, status, and, increase, their, self, esteem, a, sense, of, unity, brings, together, many, of, the, youth, gangs, that, lack, the, family, aspect, at, home, zones, of, transition, are, deteriorating, neighborhoods, with, shifting, populations, in, such, areas, conflict, between, groups, fighting, turf, wars, and, theft, promote, solidarity, and, cohesion, cohen, 1955, working, class, teenagers, joined, gangs, due, to, frustration, of, inability, to, achieve, status, and, goals, of, the, middle, class, cloward, and, ohlin, 1960, blocked, opportunity, but, unequal, distribution, of, opportunities, lead, to, creating, different, types, of, gangs, that, is, some, focused, on, robbery, and, property, theft, some, on, fighting, and, conflict, and, some, were, retreatists, focusing, on, drug, taking, spergel, 1966, was, one, of, the, first, criminologists, to, focus, on, evidence, based, practice, rather, than, intuition, into, gang, life, and, culture, participation, in, gang, related, events, during, adolescence, perpetuate, a, pattern, of, maltreatment, on, their, own, children, years, later, klein, 1971, like, spergel, studied, the, effects, on, members, of, social, workers, interventions, more, interventions, actually, lead, to, greater, gang, participation, and, solidarity, and, bonds, between, members, downes, and, rock, 1988, on, parker, s, analysis, strain, theory, applies, labeling, theory, from, experience, with, police, and, courts, control, theory, involvement, in, trouble, from, early, childhood, and, the, eventual, decision, that, the, costs, outweigh, the, benefits, and, conflict, theories, no, ethnic, group, is, more, disposed, to, gang, involvement, than, another, rather, it, is, the, status, of, being, marginalized, alienated, or, rejected, that, makes, some, groups, more, vulnerable, to, gang, formation, and, this, would, also, be, accounted, for, in, the, effect, of, social, exclusion, especially, in, terms, of, recruitment, and, retention, these, may, also, be, defined, by, age, typically, youth, or, peer, group, influences, and, the, permanence, or, consistency, of, their, criminal, activity, these, groups, also, form, their, own, symbolic, identity, or, public, representation, which, are, recognizable, by, the, community, at, large, include, colors, symbols, patches, flags, and, tattoos, research, has, focused, on, whether, the, gangs, have, formal, structures, clear, hierarchies, and, leadership, in, comparison, with, adult, groups, and, whether, they, are, rational, in, pursuit, of, their, goals, though, positions, on, structures, hierarchies, and, defined, roles, are, conflicting, some, studied, street, gangs, involved, in, drug, dealing, finding, that, their, structure, and, behavior, had, a, degree, of, organizational, rationality, members, saw, themselves, as, organized, criminals, gangs, were, formal, rational, organizations, strong, organizational, structures, well, defined, roles, and, rules, that, guided, members, behavior, also, a, specified, and, regular, means, of, income, i, e, drugs, padilla, 1992, agreed, with, the, two, above, however, some, have, found, these, to, be, loose, rather, than, well, defined, and, lacking, persistent, focus, there, was, relatively, low, cohesion, few, shared, goals, and, little, organizational, structure, shared, norms, value, and, loyalties, were, low, structures, chaotic, little, role, differentiation, or, clear, distribution, of, labor, similarly, the, use, of, violence, does, not, conform, to, the, principles, behind, protection, rackets, political, intimidation, and, drug, trafficking, activities, employed, by, those, adult, groups, in, many, cases, gang, members, graduate, from, youth, gangs, to, highly, developed, oc, groups, with, some, already, in, contact, with, such, syndicates, and, through, this, we, see, a, greater, propensity, for, imitation, gangs, and, traditional, criminal, organizations, cannot, be, universally, linked, decker, 1998, however, there, are, clear, benefits, to, both, the, adult, and, youth, organization, through, their, association, in, terms, of, structure, no, single, crime, group, is, archetypal, though, in, most, cases, there, are, well, defined, patterns, of, vertical, integration, where, criminal, groups, attempt, to, control, the, supply, and, demand, as, is, the, case, in, arms, sex, and, drug, trafficking, the, entrepreneurial, model, looks, at, either, the, individual, criminal, or, a, smaller, group, of, organized, criminals, that, capitalize, off, the, more, fluid, group, association, of, contemporary, organized, crime, this, model, conforms, to, social, learning, theory, or, differential, association, in, that, there, are, clear, associations, and, interaction, between, criminals, where, knowledge, may, be, shared, or, values, enforced, however, it, is, argued, that, rational, choice, is, not, represented, in, this, the, choice, to, commit, a, certain, act, or, associate, with, other, organized, crime, groups, may, be, seen, as, much, more, of, an, entrepreneurial, decision, contributing, to, the, continuation, of, a, criminal, enterprise, by, maximizing, those, aspects, that, protect, or, support, their, own, individual, gain, in, this, context, the, role, of, risk, is, also, easily, understandable, however, it, is, debatable, whether, the, underlying, motivation, should, be, seen, as, true, entrepreneurship, or, entrepreneurship, as, a, product, of, some, social, disadvantage, the, criminal, organization, much, in, the, same, way, as, one, would, assess, pleasure, and, pain, weighs, such, factors, as, legal, social, and, economic, risk, to, determine, potential, profit, and, loss, from, certain, criminal, activities, this, decision, making, process, rises, from, the, entrepreneurial, efforts, of, the, group, s, members, their, motivations, and, the, environments, in, which, they, work, opportunism, is, also, a, key, factor, the, organized, criminal, or, criminal, group, is, likely, to, frequently, reorder, the, criminal, associations, they, maintain, the, types, of, crimes, they, perpetrate, and, how, they, function, in, the, public, arena, recruitment, reputation, etc, in, order, to, ensure, efficiency, capitalization, and, protection, of, their, interests, culture, and, ethnicity, provide, an, environment, where, trust, and, communication, between, criminals, can, be, efficient, and, secure, this, may, ultimately, lead, to, a, competitive, advantage, for, some, groups, however, it, is, inaccurate, to, adopt, this, as, the, only, determinant, of, classification, in, organized, crime, this, categorization, includes, the, sicilian, mafia, ndrangheta, ethnic, chinese, criminal, groups, japanese, yakuza, or, boryokudan, colombian, drug, trafficking, groups, nigerian, organized, crime, groups, corsican, mafia, korean, criminal, groups, and, jamaican, posses, from, this, perspective, organized, crime, is, not, a, modern, phenomenon, the, construction, of, 17th, and, 18th, century, crime, gangs, fulfill, all, the, present, day, criteria, of, criminal, organizations, in, opposition, to, the, alien, conspiracy, theory, these, roamed, the, rural, borderlands, of, central, europe, embarking, on, many, of, the, same, illegal, activities, associated, with, today, s, crime, organizations, with, the, exception, of, money, laundering, when, the, french, revolution, created, strong, nation, states, the, criminal, gangs, moved, to, other, poorly, controlled, regions, like, the, balkans, and, southern, italy, where, the, seeds, were, sown, for, the, sicilian, mafia, the, linchpin, of, organized, crime, in, the, new, world, while, most, of, the, conceptual, frameworks, used, to, model, organized, crime, emphasize, the, role, of, actors, or, activities, computational, approaches, built, on, the, foundations, of, data, science, and, artificial, intelligence, are, focusing, on, deriving, new, insights, on, organized, crime, from, big, data, for, example, novel, machine, learning, models, have, been, applied, to, study, and, detect, urban, crime, and, online, prostitution, networks, big, data, has, also, been, used, to, develop, online, tools, predicting, the, risk, for, an, individual, to, be, a, victim, of, online, sex, trade, or, getting, drawn, into, online, sex, work, in, addition, data, from, twitter, and, google, trends, have, been, used, to, study, the, public, perceptions, of, organized, crime, organized, crime, groups, provide, a, range, of, illegal, services, and, goods, organized, crime, often, victimizes, businesses, through, the, use, of, extortion, or, theft, and, fraud, activities, like, hijacking, cargo, trucks, and, ships, robbing, goods, committing, bankruptcy, fraud, also, known, as, bust, out, insurance, fraud, or, stock, fraud, insider, trading, organized, crime, groups, also, victimize, individuals, by, car, theft, either, for, dismantling, at, chop, shops, or, for, export, art, theft, metal, theft, bank, robbery, burglary, jewelry, and, gems, theft, and, heists, shoplifting, computer, hacking, credit, card, fraud, economic, espionage, embezzlement, identity, theft, and, securities, fraud, pump, and, dump, scam, some, organized, crime, groups, defraud, national, state, or, local, governments, by, bid, rigging, public, projects, counterfeiting, money, smuggling, or, manufacturing, untaxed, alcohol, rum, running, or, cigarettes, buttlegging, and, providing, immigrant, workers, to, avoid, taxes, organized, crime, groups, seek, out, corrupt, public, officials, in, executive, law, enforcement, and, judicial, roles, so, that, their, criminal, rackets, and, activities, on, the, black, market, can, avoid, or, at, least, receive, early, warnings, about, investigation, and, prosecution, activities, of, organized, crime, include, loansharking, of, money, at, very, high, interest, rates, blackmailing, assassination, backyard, breeding, bombings, bookmaking, and, illegal, gambling, confidence, tricks, forging, early, release, prison, documents, copyright, infringement, counterfeiting, of, intellectual, property, metal, theft, fencing,

labor, people, smuggling, trading, in, endangered, species, and, trafficking, in, human, beings, organized, crime, groups, also, do, a, range, of, business, and, labor, racketeering, activities, such, as, skimming, casinos, insider, trading, setting, up, monopolies, in, industries, such, as, garbage, collecting, construction, and, cement, pouring, bid, rigging, getting, no, show, and, no, work, jobs, political, corruption, and, bullying, the, commission, of, violent, crime, may, form, part, of, a, criminal, organization, s, tools, used, to, achieve, criminogenic, goals, for, example, its, threatening, authoritative, coercive, terror, inducing, or, rebellious, role, due, to, psycho, social, factors, cultural, conflict, aggression, rebellion, against, authority, access, to, illicit, substances, counter, cultural, dynamic, or, may, in, and, of, itself, be, crime, rationally, chosen, by, individual, criminals, and, the, groups, they, form, assaults, are, used, for, coercive, measures, to, rough, up, debtors, competition, or, recruits, in, the, commission, of, robberies, in, connection, to, other, property, offenses, and, as, an, expression, of, counter, cultural, authority, violence, is, normalized, within, criminal, organizations, in, direct, opposition, to, mainstream, society, and, the, locations, they, control, whilst, the, intensity, of, violence, is, dependent, on, the, types, of, crime, the, organization, is, involved, in, as, well, as, their, organizational, structure, or, cultural, tradition, aggressive, acts, range, on, a, spectrum, from, low, grade, physical, assaults, to, major, trauma, assaults, bodily, harm, and, grievous, bodily, harm, within, the, context, of, organized, crime, must, be, understood, as, indicators, of, intense, social, and, cultural, conflict, motivations, contrary, to, the, security, of, the, public, and, other, psycho, social, factors, murder, has, evolved, from, the, honor, and, vengeance, killings, of, the, yakuza, or, sicilian, mafia, which, placed, large, physical, and, symbolic, importance, on, the, act, of, murder, its, purposes, and, consequences, to, a, much, less, discriminate, form, of, expressing, power, enforcing, criminal, authority, achieving, retribution, or, eliminating, competition, the, role, of, the, hit, man, has, been, generally, consistent, throughout, the, history, of, organized, crime, whether, that, be, due, to, the, efficiency, or, expediency, of, hiring, a, professional, assassin, or, the, need, to, distance, oneself, from, the, commission, of, murderous, acts, making, it, harder, to, prove, criminal, culpability, this, may, include, the, assassination, of, notable, figures, public, private, or, criminal, once, again, dependent, on, authority, retribution, or, competition, revenge, killings, armed, robberies, violent, disputes, over, controlled, territories, and, offenses, against, members, of, the, public, must, also, be, considered, when, looking, at, the, dynamic, between, different, criminal, organizations, and, their, at, times, conflicting, needs, after, killing, their, victims, the, gangsters, often, try, to, destroy, evidence, by, getting, rid, of, the, victims, remains, in, such, a, way, as, to, prevent, hinder, or, delay, the, discovery, of, the, body, to, prevent, identification, of, the, body, or, to, prevent, autopsy, the, different, ways, that, organized, criminals, have, been, known, to, dispose, of, dead, bodies, include, but, are, not, limited, to, hiding, the, bodies, in, trash, or, landfills, feeding, the, bodies, to, animals, such, as, pigs, or, rats, destruction, by, industrial, process, such, as, machinery, chemical, bath, molten, metal, or, a, junked, car, injection, into, the, legitimate, body, disposal, system, such, as, morgues, funeral, homes, cemeteries, crematoriums, funeral, pyres, or, cadaver, donations, or, covert, killings, at, health, care, facilities, disguising, as, animal, flesh, such, as, food, waste, or, restaurant, food, creating, false, evidence, of, the, circumstances, of, death, and, letting, investigators, dispose, of, the, body, possibly, obscuring, identity, abandonment, in, a, remote, area, where, the, body, can, degrade, significantly, while, exposure, to, elements, such, as, rain, wind, heat, etc, as, well, as, animal, activity, such, as, consumption, by, scavengers, can, contaminate, the, crime, scene, or, destroy, evidence, before, being, discovered, if, ever, such, as, a, wilderness, area, such, as, national, parks, or, nature, reserves, or, an, abandoned, area, such, as, an, abandoned, building, well, or, mine, however, there, are, also, many, instances, of, gangsters, putting, the, bodies, of, their, victims, on, display, as, a, form, of, psychological, warfare, against, their, enemies, criminal, syndicates, often, commit, acts, of, vigilantism, by, enforcing, laws, investigating, certain, criminal, acts, and, punishing, those, who, violate, such, rules, people, who, are, often, targeted, by, organized, criminals, tend, to, be, individualistic, criminals, people, who, committed, crimes, that, are, considered, particularly, heinous, by, society, people, who, committed, wrongdoings, against, members, or, associates, rivals, or, terrorist, groups, one, reason, why, criminal, groups, might, commit, vigilantism, in, their, neighborhoods, is, to, prevent, heavy, levels, of, community, policing, that, could, be, harmful, to, their, illicit, businesses, additionally, the, vigilante, acts, could, help, the, gangs, to, ingratiate, themselves, in, their, communities, in, the, us, during, the, roaring, twenties, the, anti, catholic, and, anti, semitic, ku, klux, klan, was, known, to, be, staunch, enforcers, of, prohibition, as, a, result, italian, irish, polish, and, jewish, gangsters, would, at, times, have, violent, confrontations, against, the, kkk, on, one, occasion, fbi, informant, and, mobster, gregory, scarpa, kidnapped, and, tortured, a, local, klansmen, into, revealing, the, bodies, of, civil, rights, workers, who, had, been, killed, by, the, kkk, during, world, war, ii, america, had, a, growing, number, of, nazi, supporters, that, formed, the, german, american, bund, which, was, known, to, be, threatening, to, local, jewish, people, as, a, result, jewish, mobsters, such, a, meyer, lansky, bugsy, siegel, and, jack, ruby, were, often, hired, by, the, american, jewish, community, to, help, defend, against, the, nazi, bund, even, going, as, far, as, attacking, and, killing, nazi, sympathizers, during, bund, meetings, vigilante, groups, such, as, the, black, panther, party, white, panther, party, and, young, lords, have, been, accused, of, committing, crimes, in, order, to, fund, their, political, activities, while, protection, racketeering, is, often, seen, as, nothing, more, than, extortion, criminal, syndicates, that, participate, in, protection, rackets, have, at, times, provided, genuine, protection, against, other, criminals, for, their, clients, the, reason, for, this, is, because, the, criminal, organization, would, want, the, business, of, their, clients, to, do, better, so, that, the, gang, can, demand, even, more, protection, money, additionally, if, the, gang, has, enough, knowledge, of, the, local, fencers, they, may, even, be, able, to, track, down, and, retrieve, any, objects, that, were, stolen, from, the, business, owner, to, further, help, their, clients, the, gang, may, also, force, out, disrupt, vandalize, steal, from, or, shutdown, competing, businesses, for, their, clients, in, colombia, the, insurgent, groups, were, trying, to, steal, land, kidnap, family, members, and, extort, money, from, the, drug, barons, as, a, result, the, drug, lords, of, the, medell, n, cartel, formed, a, paramilitary, vigilante, group, known, as, muerte, a, secuestradores, death, to, kidnappers, to, defend, the, cartel, against, the, farc, and, m, 19, even, kidnapping, and, torturing, the, leader, of, m, 19, before, leaving, him, tied, up, in, front, of, a, police, station, during, the, medell, n, cartel, s, war, against, the, colombian, government, both, the, norte, del, valle, cartel, and, cali, cartel, formed, and, operated, a, vigilante, group, called, los, pepes, which, also, comprised, members, of, the, colombian, government, police, and, former, members, of, the, medell, n, cartel, to, bring, about, the, downfall, of, pablo, escobar, they, did, so, by, bombing, the, properties, of, the, medell, n, cartel, and, kidnapping, torturing, and, killing, escobar, s, associates, as, well, as, working, alongside, the, search, bloc, which, would, eventually, lead, to, the, dismantling, of, the, medell, n, cartel, and, the, death, of, pablo, escobar, because, of, the, high, levels, of, corruption, the, oficina, de, envigado, would, do, things, to, help, the, police, and, vice, versa, to, the, point, where, the, police, and, the, cartel, would, sometimes, do, operations, together, against, other, criminals, additionally, the, leaders, of, la, oficina, would, often, act, as, judges, to, mediate, disputes, between, the, various, different, drug, gangs, throughout, colombia, which, according, to, some, helped, prevented, a, lot, of, disputes, from, turning, violent, on, somalia, coastline, many, people, rely, on, fishing, for, economic, survival, because, of, this, somali, pirates, are, often, known, to, attack, foreign, vessels, who, partake, in, illegal, fishing, and, overfishing, in, their, waters, and, vessels, that, illegally, dump, waste, into, their, waters, as, a, result, marine, biologists, say, that, the, local, fishery, is, recovering, in, mexico, a, vigilante, group, called, grupos, de,

methods, they, use, for, converting, its, dirty, money, into, clean, assets, encourages, corruption, organized, crime, groups, need, to, hide, the, money, s, illegal, origin, this, allows, for, the, expansion, of, oc, groups, as, the, laundry, or, wash, cycle, operates, to, cover, the, money, trail, and, convert, proceeds, of, crime, into, usable, assets, money, laundering, is, bad, for, international, and, domestic, trade, banking, reputations, and, for, effective, governments, and, rule, of, law, this, is, due, to, the, methods, used, to, hide, the, proceeds, of, crime, these, methods, include, but, are, not, limited, to, buying, easily, transported, values, transfer, pricing, and, using, underground, banks, as, well, as, infiltrating, firms, in, the, legal, economy, launderers, will, also, co, mingle, illegal, money, with, revenue, made, from, businesses, in, order, to, further, mask, their, illicit, funds, accurate, figures, for, the, amounts, of, criminal, proceeds, laundered, are, almost, impossible, to, calculate, rough, estimates, have, been, made, but, only, give, a, sense, of, the, scale, of, the, problem, and, not, quite, how, great, the, problem, truly, is, the, united, nations, office, on, drugs, and, crime, conducted, a, study, they, estimated, that, in, 2009, money, laundering, equated, to, about, 2, 7, of, global, gdp, being, laundered, this, is, equal, to, about, 1, 6, trillion, us, dollars, the, financial, action, task, force, on, money, laundering, fatf, an, intergovernmental, body, set, up, to, combat, money, laundering, has, stated, that, a, sustained, effort, between, 1996, and, 2000, by, the, financial, action, task, force, fatf, to, produce, such, estimates, failed, however, anti, money, laundering, efforts, that, seize, money, laundered, assets, in, 2001, amounted, to, 386, million, the, rapid, growth, of, money, laundering, is, due, to, money, laundering, is, a, three, stage, process, means, of, money, laundering, the, policy, aim, in, this, area, is, to, make, the, financial, markets, transparent, and, minimize, the, circulation, of, criminal, money, and, its, cost, upon, legitimate, markets, counterfeiting, money, is, another, financial, crime, the, counterfeiting, of, money, includes, illegally, producing, money, that, is, then, used, to, pay, for, anything, desired, in, addition, to, being, a, financial, crime, counterfeiting, also, involves, manufacturing, or, distributing, goods, under, assumed, names, counterfeiters, benefit, because, consumers, believe, they, are, buying, goods, from, companies, that, they, trust, when, in, reality, they, are, buying, low, quality, counterfeit, goods, in, 2007, the, oecd, reported, the, scope, of, counterfeit, products, to, include, food, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, electrical, components, tobacco, and, even, household, cleaning, products, in, addition, to, the, usual, films, music, literature, games, and, other, electrical, appliances, software, and, fashion, a, number, of, qualitative, changes, in, the, trade, of, counterfeit, products, the, economic, effects, of, organized, crime, have, been, approached, from, a, number, of, both, theoretical, and, empirical, positions, however, the, nature, of, such, activity, allows, for, misrepresentation, the, level, of, taxation, taken, by, a, nation, state, rates, of, unemployment, mean, household, incomes, and, level, of, satisfaction, with, government, and, other, economic, factors, all, contribute, to, the, likelihood, of, criminals, to, participate, in, tax, evasion, as, most, organized, crime, is, perpetrated, in, the, liminal, state, between, legitimate, and, illegitimate, markets, these, economic, factors, must, adjusted, to, ensure, the, optimal, amount, of, taxation, without, promoting, the, practice, of, tax, evasion, as, with, any, other, crime, technological, advancements, have, made, the, commission, of, tax, evasion, easier, faster, and, more, globalized, the, ability, for, organized, criminals, to, operate, fraudulent, financial, accounts, utilize, illicit, offshore, bank, accounts, access, tax, havens, or, tax, shelters, and,

major, regions, that, center, around, drug, trafficking, known, as, the, golden, triangle, burma, laos, thailand, golden, crescent, afghanistan, and, central, and, south, america, there, are, suggestions, that, due, to, the, continuing, decline, in, opium, production, in, south, east, asia, traffickers, may, begin, to, look, to, afghanistan, as, a, source, of, heroin, with, respect, to, organized, crime, and, accelerating, synthetic, drug, production, in, east, and, southeast, asia, especially, the, golden, triangle, sam, gor, also, known, as, the, company, is, the, most, prominent,

china, and, taiwan, sam, gor, previously, produced, meth, in, southern, china, and, is, now, believed, to, manufacture, mainly, in, the, golden, triangle, specifically, shan, state, myanmar, responsible, for, much, of, the, massive, surge, of, crystal, meth, in, recent, years, the, group, is, understood, to, be, headed, by, tse, chi, lop, a, chinese, canadian, gangster, born, in,

heroin, comes, mainly, from, foreign, sources, which, include, southeast, asia, s, golden, triangle, southwest, asia, and, latin, america, heroin, comes, in, two, forms, the, first, is, its, chemical, base, form, which, presents, itself, as, brown, and, the, second, is, a, salt, form, that, is, white, the, former, is, mainly, produced, in, afghanistan, and, some, south, west, countries, while, the, latter, had, a, history, of, being, produced, in, only, south, east, asia, but, has, since, moved, to, also, being, produced, in, afghanistan, there, is, some, suspicion, white, heroin, is, also, being, produced, in, iran, and, pakistan, but, it, is, not, confirmed, this, area, of, heroin, production, is, referred, to, as, the, golden, crescent, heroin, is, not, the, only, drug, being, used,

being, made, into, illegal, narcotics, a, drug, farm, can, range, in, size, from, smallholdings, to, large, plantations, in, addition, to, drug, crops, it, is, also, not, uncommon, for, drug, farms, to, also, host, livestock, both, to, have, a, legal, source, of, revenue, to, help, disguise, the, dirty, money, and, so, that, the, livestock, can, provide, a, source, of, organic, fertilizer, such, as, manure, for, the, drug, crops, there, are, multiple, instances, where, traffickers, set, up, some, of, their, drug, farms, safe, houses, and, drug, labs, in, remote, wilderness, areas, once, produced, the, fully, processed, narcotics, are, then, transported, to, more, populated, areas, to, be, sold, oftentimes, the, traffickers, stationed, in, these, remote, criminal, settlements, sustain, themselves, with, a, combination, of, survival, skills, and, with, food, supplies, and, workers, being, brought, to, them, by, associates, the, reason, that, traffickers, have, been, known, to, establish, such, remote, compounds, is, so, that, the, surrounding, area, can, help, to, provide, varying, degrees, of, natural, cover, additionally, the, traffickers, may, also, hope, that, the, surrounding, terrain, and, local, wildlife, might, serve, to, deter, or, impede, either, investigative, authorities, or, rival, gangs, if, the, location, of, the, clandestine, compound, were, revealed, while, usually, thought, of, as, an, urban, issue, drug, trafficking, is, also, known, to, be, a, problem, in, both, suburban, and, rural, areas, as, well, human, trafficking, for, the,

or, illegal, entry, of, a, person, or, persons, across, an, international, border, in, violation, of, one, or, more, countries, laws, either, clandestinely, or, through, deception, such, as, the, use, of, fraudulent, documents, the, term, is, understood, as, and, often, used, interchangeably, with, migrant, smuggling, which, is, defined, by, the, united, nations, convention, against, transnational, organized, crime, as, the, procurement, in, order, to, obtain, directly, or, indirectly, a, financial, or, other, material, benefit, of, the, illegal, entry, of, a, person, into, a, state, party, of,

countries, around, the, world, people, smuggling, generally, takes, place, with, the, consent, of, the, person, or, persons, being, smuggled, and, common, reasons, for, individuals, seeking, to, be, smuggled, include, employment, and, economic, opportunity, personal, or, familial, betterment, and, escape, from, persecution, or, conflict, the, number, of, slaves, today, remains, as, high, as, 12, million, to, 27, million, this, is, probably, the, smallest, proportion, of, slaves, to, the, rest, of, the, world, s, population, in, history, most, are, debt, slaves, largely, in, south, asia, who, are, under, debt, bondage, incurred, by, lenders, sometimes, even, for, generations, it, is, the, fastest, growing, criminal, industry, and, is, predicted, to, eventually, outgrow, drug, trafficking, today, crime, is, sometimes, thought, of, as, an, urban, phenomenon, but, for, most, of, human, history, it, was, the, rural, interfaces, that, encountered, the, majority, of, crimes, bearing, in, mind, the, fact, that, for, most, of, human, history, rural, areas, were, the, vast, majority, of, inhabited, places, for, the, most, part, within, a, village, members, kept, crime, at, very, low, rates, however, outsiders, such, as, pirates, highwaymen, and, bandits, attacked, trade, routes, and, roads, at, times, severely, disrupting, commerce, raising, costs, insurance, rates, and, prices, to, the, consumer, according, to, criminologist, paul, lunde, piracy, and, banditry, were, to, the, pre, industrial, world, what, organized, crime, is, to, modern, society, if, we, take, a, global, rather, than, a, strictly, domestic, view, it, becomes, evident, that, even, crime, of, the, organized, kind, has, a, long, if, not, a, necessarily, noble, heritage, the, word, thug, dates, back, to, early, 13th, century, india, when, thugs, or, gangs, of, criminals, roamed, from, town, to, town, looting, and, pillaging, smuggling, and, drug, trafficking, rings, are, as, old, as, the, hills, in, asia, and, africa, and, extant, criminal, organizations, in, italy, and, japan, trace, their, histories, back, several, centuries, as, lunde, states, barbarian, conquerors, whether, vandals, goths, the, norse, turks, or, mongols, are, not, normally, thought, of, as, organized, crime, groups, yet, they, share, many, features, associated, with, thriving, criminal, organizations, they, were, for, the, most, part, non, ideological, predominantly, ethnically, based, used, violence, and, intimidation, and, adhered, to, their, own, codes, of, law, in, ancient, rome, there, was, an, infamous, outlaw, called, bulla, felix, who, organized, and, led, a, gang, of, up, to, six, hundred, bandits, terrorism, is, linked, to, organized, crime, but, has, political, aims, rather, than, solely, financial, ones, so, there, is, overlap, but, separation, between, terrorism, and, organized, crime, a, fence, or, receiver, was, a, merchant, who, bought, and, sold, stolen, goods, fences, were, part, of, the, extensive, network, of, accomplices, in, the, criminal, underground, of, ming, and, qing, china, their, occupation, entailed, criminal, activity, but, as, fences, often, acted, as, liaisons, between, the, more, respectable, community, to, the, underground, criminals, they, were, seen, as, living, a, precarious, existence, on, the, fringes, of, respectable, society, a, fence, worked, alongside, bandits, but, in, a, different, line, of, work, the, network, of, criminal, accomplices, that, was, often, acquired, was, essential, to, ensuring, both, the, safety, and, the, success, of, fences, the, path, into, the, occupation, of, a, fence, stemmed, in, a, large, degree, from, necessity, as, most, fences, came, from, the, ranks, of, poorer, people, they, often, took, whatever, work, they, could, both, legal, and, illegal, like, most, bandits, operated, within, their, own, community, fences, also, worked, within, their, own, town, or, village, for, example, in, some, satellite, areas, of, the, capital, military, troops, lived, within, or, close, to, the, commoner, population, and, they, had, the, opportunity, to, hold, illegal, trades, with, commoners, in, areas, like, baoding, and, hejian, local, peasants, and, community, members, not, only, purchased, military, livestock, such, as, horses, and, cattle, but, also, helped, to, hide, the, stolen, livestock, from, military, allured, by, the, profits, local, peasants, and, community, members, became, fences, and, they, hid, criminal, activities, from, officials, in, return, for, products, or, money, from, these, soldiers, most, fences, were, not, individuals, who, only, bought, and, sold, stolen, goods, to, make, a, living, the, majority, of, fences, had, other, occupations, within, the, polite, society, and, held, a, variety, of, official, occupations, these, occupations, included, laborers, coolies, and, peddlers, such, individuals, often, encountered, criminals, in, markets, in, their, line, of, work, and, recognizing, a, potential, avenue, for, an, extra, source, of, income, formed, acquaintances, and, temporary, associations, for, mutual, aid, and, protection, with, criminals, in, one, example, an, owner, of, a, tea, house, overheard, the, conversation, between, deng, yawen, a, criminal, and, others, planning, a, robbery, and, he, offered, to, help, to, sell, the, loot, for, an, exchange, of, spoils, at, times, the, robbers, themselves, filled, the, role, of, fences, selling, to, people, they, met, on, the, road, this, may, actually, have, been, preferable, for, robbers, in, certain, circumstances, because, they, would, not, have, to, pay, the, fence, a, portion, of, the, spoils, butchers, were, also, prime, receivers, for, stolen, animals, because, of, the, simple, fact, that, owners, could, no, longer, recognize, their, livestock, once, butchers, slaughtered, them, animals, were, very, valuable, commodities, within, ming, china, and, a, robber, could, potentially, sustain, a, living, from, stealing, livestock, and, selling, them, to, butcher, fences, although, the, vast, majority, of, the, time, fences, worked, with, physical, stolen, property, fences, who, also, worked, as, itinerant, barbers, also, sold, information, as, a, good, itinerant, barbers, often, amassed, important, sources, of, information, and, news, as, they, traveled, and, sold, significant, pieces, of, information, often, to, criminals, in, search, of, places, to, hide, or, individuals, to, rob, in, this, way, itinerant, barbers, also, served, the, role, as, a, keeper, of, information, that, could, be, sold, to, both, members, of, the, criminal, underground, as, well, as, powerful, clients, in, performing, the, function, of, a, spy, fences, not, only, sold, items, such, as, jewelry, and, clothing, but, was, also, involved, in, trafficking, hostages, that, bandits, had, kidnapped, women, and, children, were, the, easiest, and, among, the, most, common, objects, the, fences, sold, most, of, the, female, hostages, were, sold, to, fences, and, then, sold, as, prostitutes, wives, or, concubines, one, example, of, human, trafficking, can, be, seen, from, chen, akuei, s, gang, who, abducted, a, servant, girl, and, sold, her, to, lin, baimao, who, in, turn, sold, her, for, thirty, parts, of, silver, as, wives, in, contrast, to, women, who, required, beauty, to, sell, for, a, high, price, children, were, sold, regardless, of, their, physical, appearance, or, family, background, children, were, often, sold, as, servants, or, entertainers, while, young, girls, were, often, sold, as, prostitutes, like, merchants, of, honest, goods, one, of, the, most, significant, tools, of, a, fence, was, their, network, of, connections, as, they, were, the, middlemen, between, robbers, and, clients, fences, needed, to, form, and, maintain, connections, in, both, the, polite, society, as, well, as, among, criminals, however, there, were, a, few, exceptions, in, which, members, of, the, so, called, well, respected, society, became, receivers, and, harborers, they, not, only, help, bandits, to, sell, the, stolen, goods, but, also, acted, as, agents, of, bandits, to, collect, protection, money, from, local, merchants, and, residents, these, part, time, fences, with, high, social, status, used, their, connection, with, bandits, to, help, themselves, gain, social, capital, as, well, as, wealth, it, was, extremely, important, to, their, occupation, that, fences, maintained, a, positive, relationship, with, their, customers, especially, their, richer, gentry, clients, when, some, members, of, the, local, elites, joined, the, ranks, of, fences, they, not, only, protect, bandits, to, protect, their, business, interests, they, actively, took, down, any, potential, threats, to, their, illegal, profiting, even, government, officials, in, the, zhejiang, province, the, local, elites, not, only, got, the, provincial, commissioner, zhu, wan, dismissed, from, his, office, but, also, eventually, him, to, suicide, this, was, possible, because, fences, often, had, legal, means, of, making, a, living, as, well, as, illegal, activities, and, could, threaten, to, turn, in, bandits, to, the, authorities, it, was, also, essential, for, them, to, maintain, a, relationship, with, bandits, however, it, was, just, as, true, that, bandits, needed, fences, to, make, a, living, as, a, result, fences, often, held, dominance, in, their, relationship, with, bandits, and, fences, could, exploit, their, position, cheating, the, bandits, by, manipulating, the, prices, they, paid, bandits, for, the, stolen, property, aside, from, simply, buying, and, selling, stolen, goods, fences, often, played, additional, roles, in, the, criminal, underground, of, early, china, because, of, the, high, floating, population, in, public, places, such, as, inns, and, tea, houses, they, often, became, ideal, places, for, bandits, and, gangs, to, gather, to, exchange, information, and, plan, for, their, next, crime, harborers, people, who, provided, safe, houses, for, criminals, often, played, the, role, of, receiving, stolen, goods, from, their, harbored, criminals, to, sell, to, other, customers, safe, houses, included, inns, tea, houses, brothels, opium, dens, as, well, as, gambling, parlors, and, employees, or, owners, of, such, institutions, often, functioned, as, harborers, as, well, as, fences, these, safe, houses, locate, in, places, where, there, are, high, floating, population, and, people, from, all, kinds, of, social, backgrounds, brothels, themselves, helped, these, bandits, to, hide, and, sell, stolen, goods, because, of, the, special, ming, law, that, exempted, brothels, from, being, held, responsible, for, the, criminal, actions, of, their, clients, even, though, the, government, required, owners, of, these, places, to, report, any, suspicious, activities, lack, of, enforcement, from, the, government, itself, and, some, of, the, owners, being, fences, for, the, bandits, made, an, ideal, safe, house, for, bandits, and, gangs, pawnshops, were, also, often, affiliated, with, fencing, stolen, goods, the, owners, or, employees, of, such, shops, often, paid, cash, for, stolen, goods, at, a, price, a, great, deal, below, market, value, to, bandits, who, were, often, desperate, for, money, and, resold, the, goods, to, earn, a, profit, two, different, ming, laws, the, da, ming, l, and, the, da, gao, drafted, by, the, hongwu, emperor, zhu, yuanzhang, sentenced, fences, with, different, penalties, based, on, the, categories, and, prices, of, the, products, that, were, stolen, in, coastal, regions, illegal, trading, with, foreigners, as, well, as, smuggling, became, a, huge, concern, for, the, government, during, the, middle, to, late, ming, era, in, order, to, prohibit, this, crime, the, government, passed, a, law, in, which, illegal, smugglers, who, traded, with, foreigners, without, the, consent, of, the, government, would, be, punished, with, exile, to, the, border, for, military, service, in, areas, where, military, troops, were, stationed, stealing, and, selling, military, property, would, result, in, a, more, severe, punishment, in, the, jiaqing, time, a, case, was, recorded, of, stealing, and, selling, military, horses, the, emperor, himself, gave, direction, that, the, thieves, who, stole, the, horses, and, the, people, who, helped, to, sell, the, horses, would, be, put, on, cangue, and, sent, to, labor, in, a, border, military, camp, in, the, salt, mines, the, penalty, for, workers, who, stole, salt, and, people, who, sold, the, stolen, salt, was, the, most, severe, anyone, who, was, arrested, and, found, guilty, of, stealing, and, selling, government, salt, was, put, to, death, during, the, victorian, era, criminals, and, gangs, started, to, form, organizations, which, would, collectively, become, london, s, criminal, underworld, criminal, societies, in, the, underworld, started, to, develop, their, own, ranks, and, groups, which, were, sometimes, called, families, and, were, often, made, up, of, lower, classes, and, operated, on, pick, pocketry, prostitution, forgery, and, counterfeiting, commercial, burglary, and, even, money, laundering, schemes, unique, also, were, the, use, of, slang, and, argots, used, by, victorian, criminal, societies, to, distinguish, each, other, like, those, propagated, by, street, gangs, like, the, peaky, blinders, one, of, the, most, infamous, crime, bosses, in, the, victorian, underworld, was, adam, worth, who, was, nicknamed, the, napoleon, of, the, criminal, world, or, the, napoleon, of, crime, and, became, the, inspiration, behind, the, popular, character, of, professor, moriarty, organized, crime, in, the, united, states, first, came, to, prominence, in, the, old, west, and, historians, such, as, brian, j, robb, and, erin, h, turner, traced, the, first, organized, crime, syndicates, to, the, coschise, cowboy, gang, and, the, wild, bunch, the, cochise, cowboys, though, loosely, organized, were, unique, for, their, criminal, operations, in, the, mexican, border, in, which, they, would, steal, and, sell, cattle, as, well, smuggled, contraband, goods, in, between, the, countries, in, the, old, west, there, were, other, examples, of, gangs, that, operated, in, ways, similar, to, an, organized, crime, syndicate, such, as, the, innocents, gang, the, jim, miller, gang, the, soapy, smith, gang, the, belle, starr, gang, and, the, bob, dozier, gang, donald, cressey, s, cosa, nostra, model, studied, mafia, families, exclusively, and, this, limits, his, broader, findings, structures, are, formal, and, rational, with, allocated, tasks, limits, on, entrance, and, influence, on, the, rules, established, for, organizational, maintenance, and, sustainability, in, this, context, there, is, a, difference, between, organized, and, professional, crime, there, is, well, defined, hierarchy, of, roles, for, leaders, and, members, underlying, rules, and, specific, goals, that, determine, their, behavior, and, these, are, formed, as, a, social, system, one, that, was, rationally, designed, to, maximize, profits, and, to, provide, forbidden, goods, albini, saw, organized, criminal, behavior, as, consisting, of, networks, of, patrons, and, clients, rather, than, rational, hierarchies, or, secret, societies, the, networks, are, characterized, by, a, loose, system, of, power, relations, each, participant, is, interested, in, furthering, his, own, welfare, criminal, entrepreneurs, are, the, patrons, and, they, exchange, information, with, their, clients, in, order, to, obtain, their, support, clients, include, members, of, gangs, local, and, national, politicians, government, officials, and, people, engaged, in, legitimate, business, people, in, the, network, may, not, directly, be, part, of, the, core, criminal, organization, furthering, the, approach, of, both, cressey, and, albini, ianni, and, ianni, studied, italian, american, crime, syndicates, in, new, york, and, other, cities, kinship, is, seen, as, the, basis, of, organized, crime, rather, than, the, structures, cressey, had, identified, this, includes, fictive, godparental, and, affinitive, ties, as, well, as, those, based, on, blood, relations, and, it, is, the, impersonal, actions, not, the, status, or, affiliations, of, their, members, that, define, the, group, rules, of, conduct, and, behavioral, aspects, of, power, and, networks, and, roles, include, the, following, strong, family, ties, are, derived, from, the, traditions, of, southern, italy, where, family, rather, than, the, church, or, state, is, the, basis, of, social, order, and, morality, one, of, the, most, important, trends, to, emerge, in, criminological, thinking, about, oc, in, recent, years, is, the, suggestion, that, it, is, not, in, a, formal, sense, organized, at, all, evidence, includes, lack, of, centralized, control, absence, of, formal, lines, of, communication, fragmented, organizational, structure, it, is, distinctively, disorganized, for, example, seattle, s, crime, network, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, consisted, of, groups, of, businessmen, politicians, and, of, law, enforcement, officers, they, all, had, links, to, a, national, network, via, meyer, lansky, who, was, powerful, but, there, was, no, evidence, that, lansky, or, anyone, else, exercised, centralized, control, over, them, while, some, crime, involved, well, known, criminal, hierarchies, in, the, city, criminal, activity, was, not, subject, to, central, management, by, these, hierarchies, nor, by, other, controlling, groups, nor, were, activities, limited, to, a, finite, number, of, objectives, the, networks, of, criminals, involved, with, the, crimes, did, not, exhibit, organizational, cohesion, too, much, emphasis, had, been, placed, on, the, mafia, as, controlling, oc, the, mafia, were, certainly, powerful, but, they, were, part, of, a, heterogeneous, underworld, a, network, characterized, by, complex, webs, of, relationships, oc, groups, were, violent, and, aimed, at, making, money, but, because, of, the, lack, of, structure, and, fragmentation, of, objectives, they, were, disorganized, further, studies, showed, neither, bureaucracy, nor, kinship, groups, are, the, primary, structure, of, organized, crime, rather, the, primary, structures, were, found, to, lie, in, partnerships, or, a, series, of, joint, business, ventures, despite, these, conclusions, all, researchers, observed, a, degree, of, managerial, activities, among, the, groups, they, studied, all, observed, networks, and, a, degree, of, persistence, and, there, may, be, utility, in, focusing, on, the, identification, of, organizing, roles, of, people, and, events, rather, than, the, group, s, structure, there, may, be, three, main, approaches, to, understand, the, organizations, in, terms, of, their, roles, as, social, systems, organized, crime, groups, may, be, a, combination, of, all, three, international, consensus, on, defining, organized, crime, has, become, important, since, the, 1970s, due, to, its, increased, prevalence, and, impact, e, g, un, in, 1976, and, eu, 1998, oc, is, the, large, scale, and, complex, criminal, activity, carried, on, by, groups, of, persons, however, loosely, or, tightly, organized, for, the, enrichment, of, those, participating, at, the, expense, of, the, community, and, its, members, it, is, frequently, accomplished, through, ruthless, disregard, of, any, law, including, offenses, against, the, person, and, frequently, in, connection, with, political, corruption, un, a, criminal, organization, shall, mean, a, lasting, structured, association, of, two, or, more, persons, acting, in, concert, with, a, view, to, committing, crimes, or, other, offenses, which, are, punishable, by, deprivation, of, liberty, or, a, detention, order, of, a, maximum, of, at, least, four, years, or, a, more, serious, penalty, whether, such, crimes, or, offenses, are, an, end, in, themselves, or, a, means, of, obtaining, material, benefits, and, if, necessary, of, improperly, influencing, the, operation, of, public, authorities, ue, not, all, groups, exhibit, the, same, characteristics, of, structure, however, violence, and, corruption, and, the, pursuit, of, multiple, enterprises, and, continuity, serve, to, form, the, essence, of, oc, activity, there, are, eleven, characteristics, from, the, european, commission, and, europol, pertinent, to, a, working, definition, of, organized, crime, six, of, those, must, be, satisfied, and, the, four, in, italics, are, mandatory, summarized, they, are, with, the, convention, against, transnational, organized, crime, the, palermo, convention, having, a, similar, definition, others, stress, the, importance, of, power, profit, and, perpetuity, defining, organized, criminal, behavior, as, definitions, need, to, bring, together, its, legal, and, social, elements, oc, has, widespread, social, political, and, economic, effects, it, uses, violence, and, corruption, to, achieve, its, ends, oc, when, group, primarily, focused, on, illegal, profits, systematically, commit, crimes, that, adversely, affect, society, and, are, capable, of, successfully, shielding, their, activities, in, particular, by, being, willing, to, use, physical, violence, or, eliminate, individuals, by, way, of, corruption, it, is, a, mistake, to, use, the, term, oc, as, though, it, denotes, a, clear, and, well, defined, phenomenon, the, evidence, regarding, oc, shows, a, less, well, organized, very, diversified, landscape, of, organizing, criminals, the, economic, activities, of, these, organizing, criminals, can, be, better, described, from, the, viewpoint, of, crime, enterprises, than, from, a, conceptually, unclear, frameworks, such, as, oc, many, of, the, definitions, emphasize, the, group, nature, of, oc, the, organization, of, its, members, its, use, of, violence, or, corruption, to, achieve, its, goals, and, its, extra, jurisdictional, character, oc, may, appear, in, many, forms, at, different, times, and, in, different, places, due, to, the, variety, of, definitions, there, is, evident, danger, in, asking, what, is, oc, and, expecting, a, simple, answer, some, espouse, that, all, organized, crime, operates, at, an, international, level, though, there, is, currently, no, international, court, capable, of, trying, offenses, resulting, from, such, activities, the, international, criminal, court, s, remit, extends, only, to, dealing, with, people, accused, of, offenses, against, humanity, e, g, genocide, if, a, network, operates, primarily, from, one, jurisdiction, and, carries, out, its, illicit, operations, there, and, in, some, other, jurisdictions, it, is, international, though, it, may, be, appropriate, to, use, the, term, transnational, only, to, label, the, activities, of, a, major, crime, group, that, is, centered, in, no, one, jurisdiction, but, operating, in, many, the, understanding, of, organized, crime, has, therefore, progressed, to, combined, internationalization, and, an, understanding, of, social, conflict, into, one, of, power, control, efficiency, risk, and, utility, all, within, the, context, of, organizational, theory, the, accumulation, of, social, economic, and, political, power, have, sustained, themselves, as, a, core, concerns, of, all, criminal, organizations, contemporary, organized, crime, may, be, very, different, from, traditional, mafia, style, particularly, in, terms, of, the, distribution, and, centralization, of, power, authority, structures, and, the, concept, of, control, over, one, s, territory, and, organization, there, is, a, tendency, away, from, centralization, of, power, and, reliance, upon, family, ties, towards, a, fragmentation, of, structures, and, informality, of, relationships, in, crime, groups, organized, crime, most, typically, flourishes, when, a, central, government, and, civil, society, is, disorganized, weak, absent, or, untrustworthy, this, may, occur, in, a, society, facing, periods, of, political, economic, or, social, turmoil, or, transition, such, as, a, change, of, government, or, a, period, of, rapid, economic, development, particularly, if, the, society, lacks, strong, and, established, institutions, and, the, rule, of, law, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, revolutions, of, 1989, in, eastern, europe, that, saw, the, downfall, of, the, communist, bloc, created, a, breeding, ground, for, criminal, organizations, the, newest, growth, sectors, for, organized, crime, are, identity, theft, and, online, extortion, these, activities, are, troubling, because, they, discourage, consumers, from, using, the, internet, for, e, commerce, e, commerce, was, supposed, to, level, the, playing, ground, between, small, and, large, businesses, but, the, growth, of, online, organized, crime, is, leading, to, the, opposite, effect, large, businesses, are, able, to, afford, more, bandwidth, to, resist, denial, of, service, attacks, and, superior, security, furthermore, organized, crime, using, the, internet, is, much, harder, to, trace, down, for, the, police, even, though, they, increasingly, deploy, cybercops, since, most, police, forces, and, law, enforcement, agencies, operate, within, a, local, or, national, jurisdiction, while, the, internet, makes, it, easier, for, criminal, organizations, to, operate, across, such, boundaries, without, detection, in, the, past, criminal, organizations, have, naturally, limited, themselves, by, their, need, to, expand, putting, them, in, competition, with, each, other, this, competition, often, leading, to, violence, uses, valuable, resources, such, as, manpower, either, killed, or, sent, to, prison, equipment, and, finances, in, the, united, states, james, whitey, bulger, the, irish, mob, boss, of, the, winter, hill, gang, in, boston, turned, informant, for, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, fbi, he, used, this, position, to, eliminate, competition, and, consolidate, power, within, the, city, of, boston, which, led, to, the, imprisonment, of, several, senior, organized, crime, figures, including, gennaro, angiulo, underboss, of, the, patriarca, crime, family, infighting, sometimes, occurs, within, an, organization, such, as, the, castellamarese, war, of, 1930, 31, and, the, boston, irish, mob, wars, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, today, criminal, organizations, are, increasingly, working, together, realizing, that, it, is, better, to, work, in, cooperation, rather, than, in, competition, with, each, other, once, again, consolidating, power, this, has, led, to, the, rise, of, global, criminal, organizations, such, as, mara, salvatrucha, 18th, street, gang, and, barrio, azteca, the, american, mafia, in, addition, to, having, links, with, organized, crime, groups, in, italy, such, as, the, camorra, the, ndrangheta, sacra, corona, unita, and, sicilian, mafia, has, at, various, times, done, business, with, the, irish, mob, jewish, american, organized, crime, the, japanese, yakuza, indian, mafia, the, russian, mafia, thief, in, law, and, post, soviet, organized, crime, groups, the, chinese, triads, chinese,

organized, crime, groups, held, 322, billion, in, assets, in, 2005, this, rise, in, cooperation, between, criminal, organizations, has, meant, that, law, enforcement, agencies, are, increasingly,

to, explain, the, inside, the, mind, of, the, criminal, this, theory, treats, all, individuals, as, rational, operators, committing, criminal, acts, after, consideration, of, all, associated, risks, detection, and, punishment, compared, with, the, rewards, of, crimes, personal, financial, etc, little, emphasis, is, placed, on, the, offenders, emotional, state, the, role, of, criminal, organizations, in, lowering, the, perceptions, of, risk, and, increasing, the, likelihood, of, personal, benefit, is, prioritized, by, this, approach, with, the, organizations, structure, purpose, and, activity, being, indicative, of, the, rational, choices, made, by, criminals, and, their, organizers, this, theory, sees, criminal, behavior, as, reflective, of, an, individual, internal, calculation, by, the, criminal, that, the, benefits, associated, with, offending, whether, financial, or, otherwise, outweigh, the, perceived, risks, the, perceived, strength, importance, or, infallibility, of, the, criminal, organization, is, directly, proportional, to, the, types, of, crime, committed, their, intensity, and, arguably, the, level, of, community, response, the, benefits, of, participating, in, organized, crime, higher, financial, rewards, greater, socioeconomic, control, and, influence, protection, of, the, family, or, significant, others, perceived, freedoms, from, oppressive, laws, or, norms, contribute, greatly, to, the, psychology, behind, highly, organized, group, offending, criminals, learn, through, associations, with, one, another, the, success, of, organized, crime, groups, is, therefore, dependent, upon, the, strength, of, their, communication, and, the, enforcement, of, their, value, systems, the, recruitment, and, training, processes, employed, to, sustain, build, or, fill, gaps, in, criminal, operations, an, understanding, of, this, theory, sees, close, associations, between, criminals, imitation, of, superiors, and, understanding, of, value, systems, processes, and, authority, as, the, main, drivers, behind, organized, crime, interpersonal, relationships, define, the, motivations, the, individual, develops, with, the, effect, of, family, or, peer, criminal, activity, being, a, strong, predictor, of, inter, generational, offending, this, theory, also, developed, to, include, the, strengths, and, weaknesses, of, reinforcement, which, in, the, context, of, continuing, criminal, enterprises, may, be, used, to, help, understand, propensities, for, certain, crimes, or, victims, level, of, integration, into, the, mainstream, culture, and, likelihood, of, recidivism, success, in, rehabilitation, under, this, theory, organized, crime, exists, because, legitimate, markets, leave, many, customers, and, potential, customers, unsatisfied, high, demand, for, a, particular, good, or, service, e, g, drugs, prostitution, arms, slaves, low, levels, of, risk, detection, and, high, profits, lead, to, a, conducive, environment, for, entrepreneurial, criminal, groups, to, enter, the, market, and, profit, by, supplying, those, goods, and, services, for, success, there, must, be, under, these, conditions,

criminal, operations, to, adjust, as, will, deterrence, measures, reducing, demand, and, the, restriction, of, resources, controlling, the, ability, to, supply, or, produce, to, supply, sutherland, goes, further, to, say, that, deviancy, is, contingent, on, conflicting, groups, within, society, and, that, such, groups, struggle, over, the, means, to, define, what, is, criminal, or, deviant, within, society, criminal, organizations, therefore, gravitate, around, illegal, avenues, of, production, profit, making, protectionism, or, social, control, and, attempt, by, increasing, their, operations, or, membership, to, make, these, acceptable, this, also, explains, the, propensity, of, criminal, organizations, to, develop, protection, rackets, to, coerce, through, the, use, of, violence, aggression, and, threatening, behavior, at, times, termed, terrorism, preoccupation, with, methods, of, accumulating, profit, highlight, the, lack, of, legitimate, means, to, achieve, economic, or, social, advantage, as, does, the, organization, of, white, collar, crime, or, political, corruption, though, it, is, debatable, whether, these, are, based, on, wealth, power, or, both,

and, witness, affluence, they, are, deprived, of, and, which, is, virtually, impossible, for, them, to, attain, through, conventional, means, the, concept, of, neighborhood, is, central, to, this, theory, as, it, defines, the, social, learning, locus, of, control, cultural, influences, and, access, to, social, opportunity, experienced, by, criminals, and, the, groups, they, form, fear, of, or, lack, of, trust, in, mainstream, authority, may, also, be, a, key, contributor, to, social, disorganization, organized, crime, groups, replicate, such, figures, and, thus, ensure, control, over, the, counter, culture, this, theory, has, tended, to, view, violent, or, antisocial, behavior, by, gangs, as, reflective, of, their, social, disorganization, rather, than, as, a, product, or, tool, of, their, organization, sociologist, robert, k, merton, believed, deviance, depended, on, society, s, definition, of, success, and, the, desires, of, individuals, to, achieve, success, through, socially,

organizations, capitalize, on, states, with, a, lack, of, norm, by, imposing, criminogenic, needs, and, illicit, avenues, to, achieve, them, this, has, been, used, as, the, basis, for, numerous, meta, theories, of, organized, crime, through, its, integration, of, social, learning, cultural, deviance, and, criminogenic, motivations, if, crime, is, seen, as, a, function, of, anomie, organized, behavior, produces, stability, increases, protection, or, security, and, may, be, directly, proportional, to, market, forces, as, expressed, by, entrepreneurship, or, risk, based, approaches, it, is, the, inadequate, supply, of, legitimate, opportunities, that, constrains, the, ability, for, the, individual, to, pursue, valued, societal, goals, and, reduces, the, likelihood, that, using, legitimate, opportunities, will, enable, them, to, satisfy, such, goals, due, to, their, position, in, society, criminals, violate, the, law, because, they, belong, to, a, unique, subculture, the, counter, culture, their, values, and, norms, conflicting, with, those, of, the, working, middle, or, upper, classes, upon, which, criminal, laws, are, based, this, subculture, shares, an, alternative,

immigrants, or, those, not, within, the, dominant, ethnocentric, groups, and, their, influences, are, thought, to, dictate, the, prevalence, of, organized, crime, in, society, the, alien, theory,
