a, singular, and, plural, noun, e, g, japanese, french, etc, very, little, is, known, about, the, native, hmong, name, as, it, is, not, mentioned, in, chinese, historical, records, since, the, han, identified, the, hmong, as, miao, the, meaning, of, it, is, debatable, and, no, one, is, sure, of, its, origin, although, it, can, be, traced, back, to, several, provinces, in, china, however, hmong, americans, and, hmong, laotians, often, associate, it, with, free, and, or, hmoov, fate, it, serves, as, a, reminder, to, them, of, their, history, of, fighting, oppression, before, the, 1970s, the,

their, traditional, clothing, style, of, head, dress, or, the, provinces, from, which, they, come, the, hmong, groups, in, vietnam, and, laos, from, the, 18th, century, to, the, present, day, are, known, as, black, hmong, hmoob, dub, striped, hmong, hmoob, txaij, white, hmong, hmoob, dawb, hmong, leng, hmoob, leeg, and, green, hmong, hmoob, ntsuab, in, other, places, in, asia, groups, are, also, known, as, black, hmong, hmoob, dub, or, hmong, dou, striped, hmong, hmoob, txaij, or, hmoob, quas, npab, hmong, shi, hmong, pe, hmong, pua, and, hmong, xau, hmong, xanh, green, hmong, hmong, do, red, hmong, na, mieo, and, various, other, subgroups, these, include, the, flower, hmong, or, the, variegated, hmong, hmong, lenh, or, hmong, hoa, so, named, because, of, their, bright, colorful, embroidery, work, called, pa, ndau, or, paj, ntaub, literally, flower, cloth, when, western, authors, first, came, in, contact, with, hmong, people, in, the, 18th, century, they, referred, to, them, by, writing, ethnonyms, which, were, previously, assigned, to, them, by, the, chinese, i, e, miao, or, variants, this, practice, continued, into, the, 20th, century, even, ethnographers, studying, the, hmong, people, in, southeast, asia, often, referred, to, them, as, meo, a, corruption, of, miao, applied, by, thai, and, lao, people, to, the, hmong, although, meo, was, an, official, term, it, was, often, used, as, an, insult, against, the, hmong, people, and, it, is, considered, to, be, derogatory, the, issue, came, to, a, head, during, the, passage, of, california, state, assembly, bill, ab, 78, in, the, 2003, 2004, season, introduced, by, doua, vu, and, assembly, member, sarah, reyes, district, 31, fresno, the, bill, encouraged, changes, in, secondary, education, curriculum, to, include, information, about, the, secret, war, and, the, role, of, hmong, people, in, the, war, furthermore, the, bill, called, for, the, use, of, oral, histories, and, first, hand, accounts, by, hmong, people, who, had, participated, in, the, war, and, were, caught, up, in, its, aftermath, originally, the, language, of, the, bill, mentioned, only, hmong, people, intending, to, include, the, entire, community, several, mong, leng, activists, led, by, dr, paoze, thao, professor, of, linguistics, and, education, at, california, state, university, monterey, bay, drew, attention, to, the, problems, associated, with, omitting, mong, from, the, language, of, the, bill, they, noted, that, despite, nearly, equal, numbers, of, hmong, der, and, mong, leng, in, the, united, states, resources, are, disproportionately, allocated, to, the, hmong, der, community, this, not, only, includes, scholarly, research, but, also, the, translation, of, materials, including, the, curriculum, proposed, by, the, bill, despite, these, arguments, mong, was, not, added, to, the, bill, in, the, version, of, the, bill, that, was, passed, by, the, assembly, hmong, was, replaced, by, southeast, asians, a, broader, and, more, inclusive, term, dr, paoze, thao, and, some, others, strongly, feel, that, hmong, can, only, be, used, in, reference, to, hmong, der, people, because, it, does, not, include, mong, leng, people, he, feels, that, the, use, of, hmong, in, reference, to, both, groups, perpetuates, the, marginalization, of, the, mong, leng, language, and, culture, thus, he, advocates, the, use, of, hmong, and, mong, in, reference, to, the, entire, ethnic, group, other, scholars, including, anthropologist, dr, gary, yia, lee, a, hmong, der, person, suggests, that, for, the, past, 30, years, hmong, has, been, used, in, reference, to, the, entire, community, and, as, a, result, the, inclusion, of, mong, leng, people, is, understandable, some, argue, that, such, distinctions, create, unnecessary, divisions, within, the, global, community, arguing, that, the, use, of, these, distinctions, will, only, confuse, non, hmong, and, mong, people, who, are, both, trying, to, learn, more, about, hmong, and, mong, history, and, culture, as, a, compromise, alternative, multiple, iterations, of, hmong, have, been, proposed, a, hmong, theologian, rev, dr, paul, joseph, t, khamdy, yang, has, proposed, the, use, of, the, term, hmong, in, reference, to, the, hmong, and, the, mong, communities, by, capitalizing, the, h, and, the, m, the, ethnologist, jacques, lemoine, has, also, begun, to, use, the, term, h, mong, in, reference, to, the, entirety, of, the, hmong, and, mong, communities, some, non, chinese, hmong, advocate, for, the, term, hmong, to, be, used, not, only, to, designate, their, dialect, group, but, also, other, miao, groups, living, in, china, they, generally, claim, that, the, word, miao, or, meo, is, a, derogatory, term, with, connotations, of, barbarism, that, probably, should, not, be, used, at, all, the, term, was, later, adopted, by, tai, speaking, groups, in, southeast, asia, where, it, took, on, especially, insulting, associations, for, hmong, people, despite, its, official, status, in, modern, china, the, term, miao, does, not, carry, these, negative, associations, and, people, of, the, various, sub, groups, that, constitute, this, officially, recognized, nationality, freely, identify, themselves, as, miao, or, chinese, typically, reserving, more, specific, ethnonyms, for, intra, ethnic, communication, during, the, struggle, for, political, recognition, after, 1949, it, was, members, of, these, ethnic, minorities, who, campaigned, for, identification, under, the, umbrella, term, miao, taking, advantage, of, its, familiarity, and, associations, of, historical, political, oppression, contemporary, transnational, interactions, between, hmong, in, the, west, and, miao, groups, in, china, following, the, 1975, hmong, emigration, led, to, the, development, of, a, global, hmong, identity, that, includes, linguistically, and, culturally, related, minorities, in, china, with, no, previous, ethnic, affiliation, scholarly, and, commercial, exchanges, increasingly, made, over, the, internet, have, also, resulted, in, an, exchange, of, terminology, including, some, hmong, people, accepting, the, designation, miao, after, visiting, china, and, some, nationalist, non, hmong, miao, peoples, identifying, as, hmong, such, realignments, of, identity, while, largely, the, concern, of, economically, elite, community, leaders, reflects, a, trend, towards, the, interchangeability, of, the, terms, hmong, and, miao, linguistic, data, shows, that, the, hmong, of, the, peninsula, stem, from, the, miao, of, southern, china, as, one, among, a, set, of, ethnic, groups, belonging, to, the, hmong, mien, language, family, linguistically, and, culturally, speaking, the, hmong, and, the, other, sub, groups, of, the, miao, have, little, in, common, vietnam, where, their, presence, is, attested, from, the, late, 18th, century, onwards, and, characterized, with, both, assimilation, cooperation, and, hostility, is, likely, to, be, the, first, southeastern, eurasian, country, into, which, the, hmong, migrated, at, the, 2019, national, census, there, were, 1, 393, 547, hmong, living, in, vietnam, the, vast,

guaranteed, a, regular, cash, income, today, cash, cropping, is, the, main, economic, activity, as, in, china, and, laos, hmong, participate, to, a, certain, degree, in, local, and, regional, administration, in, the, late, 1990s, several, thousands, of, hmong, started, moving, to, the, central, highlands, and, some, crossed, the, border, into, cambodia, constituting, the, first, attested, presence, of, hmong, settlers, in, that, country, in, 2015, the, hmong, in, laos, numbered, 595, 028, hmong, settlement, there, is, nearly, as, ancient, as, in, vietnam, after, the, 1975, communist, victory, thousands, of, hmong, from, laos, had, to, seek, refuge, abroad, see, laos, below, approximately, 30, percent, of, the, hmong, have, left, although, the, only, concrete, figure, we, have, is,

modest, number, of, hmong, perhaps, around, 2, 500, but, no, reliable, census, has, been, conducted, there, recently, as, result, of, refugee, movements, in, the, wake, of, the, indochina, wars, 1946, 1975, in, particular, in, laos, the, largest, hmong, community, to, settle, outside, asia, went, to, the, united, states, where, approximately, 100, 000, individuals, had, already, arrived, by, 1990,

been, perceived, differently, by, various, modern, political, organizations, and, in, different, historical, periods, since, the, hmong, are, an, ethnic, minority, in, vietnam, their, loyalty, toward, the, vietnamese, state, has, been, frequently, questioned, by, the, state, however, many, hmong, in, vietnam, are, fiercely, loyal, regardless, of, the, current, ideologies, of, the, government, the, hmong, in, laos, and, cambodia, are, the, most, supportive, of, active, resistance, these, tend, to, be, hmong, christians, that, have, been, targeted, by, all, three, vietnamese, governments, the, hmong, in, vietnam, also, receive, cultural, and, political, incentives, from, the, government, which, led, to, the, vietnamese, hmong, further, diverging, from, the, laotian, hmong, since, the,

laos, to, thailand, following, the, victory, of, the, pathet, lao, in, 1975, while, some, ended, up, in, refugee, camps, others, settled, in, mountainous, areas, among, more, ancient, hill, tribes,
