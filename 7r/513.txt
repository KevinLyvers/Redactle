a, tort, is, a, civil, wrong, other, than, breach, of, contract, that, causes, a, claimant, to, suffer, loss, or, harm, resulting, in, legal, liability, for, the, person, who, commits, the, tortious, act, tort, law, can, be, contrasted, with, criminal, law, which, deals, with, criminal, wrongs, that, are, punishable, by, the, state, while, criminal, law, aims, to, punish, individuals, who, commit, crimes, tort, law, aims, to, compensate, individuals, who, suffer, harm, as, a, result, of, the, actions, of, others, some, wrongful, acts, such, as, assault, and, battery, can, result, in, both, a, civil, lawsuit, and, a, criminal, prosecution, in, countries, where, the, civil, and, criminal, legal, systems, are, separate, tort, law, may, also, be, contrasted, with, contract, law, which, provides, civil, remedies, after, breach, of, a, duty, that, arises, from, a, contract, obligations, in, both, tort, and, criminal, law, are, more, fundamental, and, are, imposed, regardless, of, whether, the, parties, have, a, contract, while, tort, law, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, largely, derives, from, roman, law, common, law, jurisdictions, derive, their, tort, law, from, customary, english, tort, law, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, based, on, civil, codes, both, contractual, and, tortious, or, delictual, liability, is, typically, outlined, in, a, civil, code, based, on, roman, law, principles, tort, law, is, referred, to, as, the, law, of, delict, in, scots, and, roman, dutch, law, and, resembles, tort, law, in, common, law, jurisdictions, in, that, rules, regarding, civil, liability, are, established, primarily, by, precedent, and, theory, rather, than, an, exhaustive, code, however, like, other, civil, law, jurisdictions, the, underlying, principles, are, drawn, from, roman, law, a, handful, of, jurisdictions, have, codified, a, mixture, of, common, and, civil, law, jurisprudence, either, due, to, their, colonial, past, e, g, qu, bec, st, lucia, mauritius, or, due, to, influence, from, multiple, legal, traditions, when, their, civil, codes, were, drafted, e, g, mainland, china, the, philippines, and, thailand, furthermore, israel, essentially, codifies, common, law, provisions, on, tort, in, common, civil, and, mixed, law, jurisdictions, alike, the, main, remedy, available, to, plaintiffs, under, tort, law, is, compensation, in, damages, or, money, further, in, the, case, of, a, continuing, tort, or, even, where, harm, is, merely, threatened, the, courts, will, sometimes, grant, an, injunction, such, as, in, the, english, case, of, miller, v, jackson, usually, injunctions, will, not, impose, positive, obligations, on, tortfeasors, but, some, jurisdictions, such, as, those, in, australia, can, make, an, order, for, specific, performance, to, ensure, that, the, defendant, carries, out, certain, legal, obligations, especially, in, relation, to, nuisance, matters, at, the, same, time, each, legal, system, provides, for, a, variety, of, defences, for, defendants, in, tort, claims, which, partially, or, fully, shield, defendants, from, liability, in, a, limited, range, of, cases, varying, between, jurisdictions, tort, law, will, tolerate, self, help, as, an, appropriate, remedy, for, certain, torts, one, example, of, this, is, the, toleration, of, the, use, of, reasonable, force, to, expel, a, trespasser, which, is, typically, also, a, defence, against, the, tort, of, battery, in, some, but, not, all, civil, and, mixed, law, jurisdictions, the, term, delict, is, used, to, refer, to, this, category, of, civil, wrong, though, it, can, also, refer, to, criminal, offences, other, jurisdictions, may, use, terms, such, as, extracontractual, responsibility, france, or, civil, responsibility, qu, bec, in, comparative, law, the, term, tort, is, generally, used, the, word, tort, was, first, used, in, a, legal, context, in, the, 1580s, although, different, words, were, used, for, similar, concepts, prior, to, this, time, a, person, who, commits, a, tortious, act, is, called, a, tortfeasor, although, crimes, may, be, torts, the, cause, of, legal, action, in, civil, torts, is, not, necessarily, the, result, of, criminal, action, a, victim, of, harm, commonly, called, the, injured, party, or, plaintiff, can, recover, their, losses, as, damages, in, a, lawsuit, to, prevail, the, plaintiff, in, the, lawsuit, must, generally, show, that, the, tortfeasor, s, actions, or, lack, of, action, was, the, proximate, cause, of, the, harm, though, the, specific, requirements, vary, between, jurisdictions, torts, and, crimes, in, common, law, originate, in, the, germanic, system, of, compensatory, fines, for, wrongs, with, no, clear, distinction, between, crimes, and, other, wrongs, in, anglo, saxon, law, most, wrongs, required, payment, in, money, paid, to, the, wronged, person, or, their, clan, fines, in, the, form, of, w, te, lit, blame, or, fault, were, paid, to, the, king, or, holder, of, a, court, for, disturbances, of, public, order, while, the, fine, of, weregild, was, imposed, on, those, who, committed, murder, with, the, intention, of, preventing, blood, feuds, some, wrongs, in, later, law, codes, were, botleas, without, remedy, e, g, theft, open, murder, arson, treason, against, one, s, lord, that, is, unable, to, be, compensated, and, those, convicted, of, a, botleas, crime, were, at, the, king, s, mercy, items, or, creatures, which, caused, death, were, also, destroyed, as, deodands, alfred, the, great, s, doom, book, distinguished, unintentional, injuries, from, intentional, ones, and, defined, culpability, based, on, status, age, and, gender, after, the, norman, conquest, fines, were, paid, only, to, courts, or, the, king, and, quickly, became, a, revenue, source, a, wrong, became, known, as, a, tort, or, trespass, and, there, arose, a, division, between, civil, pleas, and, pleas, of, the, crown, the, petty, assizes, i, e, of, novel, disseisin, of, mort, d, ancestor, and, of, darrein, presentment, were, established, in, 1166, as, a, remedy, for, interference, with, possession, of, freehold, land, the, trespass, action, was, an, early, civil, plea, in, which, damages, were, paid, to, the, victim, if, no, payment, was, made, the, defendant, was, imprisoned, it, arose, in, local, courts, for, slander, breach, of, contract, or, interference, with, land, goods, or, persons, although, the, details, of, its, exact, origin, are, unclear, it, became, popular, in, royal, courts, so, that, in, the, 1250s, the, writ, of, trespass, was, created, and, made, de, cursu, available, by, right, not, fee, however, it, was, restricted, to, interference, with, land, and, forcible, breaches, of, the, king, s, peace, it, may, have, arisen, either, out, of, the, appeal, of, felony, or, assize, of, novel, disseisin, or, replevin, later, after, the, statute, of, westminster, 1285, in, the, 1360s, the, trespass, on, the, case, action, arose, for, when, the, defendant, did, not, direct, force, as, its, scope, increased, it, became, simply, action, on, the, case, the, english, judicature, act, passed, 1873, through, 1875, abolished, the, separate, actions, of, trespass, and, trespass, on, the, case, in, 1401, the, english, case, beaulieu, v, finglam, imposed, strict, liability, for, the, escape, of, fire, additionally, strict, liability, was, imposed, for, the, release, of, cattle, negligently, handling, fire, was, of, particular, importance, in, these, societies, given, capacity, for, destruction, and, relatively, limited, firefighting, resources, liability, for, common, carrier, which, arose, around, 1400, was, also, emphasised, in, the, medieval, period, unintentional, injuries, were, relatively, infrequent, in, the, medieval, period, as, transportation, improved, and, carriages, became, popular, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, however, collisions, and, carelessness, became, more, prominent, in, court, records, in, general, scholars, of, england, such, as, william, blackstone, took, a, hostile, view, to, litigation, and, rules, against, champerty, and, maintenance, and, vexatious, litigation, existed, the, right, of, victims, to, receive, redress, was, regarded, by, later, english, scholars, as, one, of, the, rights, of, englishmen, blackstone, s, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, which, was, published, in, the, late, 18th, century, contained, a, volume, on, private, wrongs, as, torts, and, even, used, the, word, tort, in, a, few, places, in, contemporary, common, law, jurisdictions, successful, claimants, in, both, tort, and, contract, law, must, show, that, they, have, suffered, foreseeable, loss, or, harm, as, a, direct, result, of, the, breach, of, duty, legal, injuries, addressable, under, tort, law, in, common, law, jurisdictions, are, not, limited, to, physical, injuries, and, may, include, emotional, economic, or, reputational, injuries, as, well, as, violations, of, privacy, property, or, constitutional, rights, torts, comprise, such, varied, topics, as, automobile, accidents, false, imprisonment, defamation, product, liability, copyright, infringement, and, environmental, pollution, toxic, torts, modern, torts, are, heavily, affected, by, insurance, and, insurance, law, as, many, cases, are, settled, through, claims, adjustment, rather, than, by, trial, and, are, defended, by, insurance, lawyers, with, the, insurance, policy, setting, a, ceiling, on, the, possible, payment, while, individuals, and, corporations, are, typically, only, liable, for, their, own, actions, indirect, liability, for, the, tortious, acts, of, others, may, arise, by, operation, of, law, notably, through, joint, and, several, liability, doctrines, as, well, as, forms, of, secondary, liability, liability, may, arise, through, enterprise, liability, or, in, product, liability, cases, in, the, united, states, market, share, liability, in, certain, cases, a, person, might, hold, vicarious, liability, for, their, employee, or, child, under, the, law, of, agency, through, the, doctrine, of, respondeat, superior, for, example, if, a, shop, employee, spilled, cleaning, liquid, on, the, supermarket, floor, and, a, victim, fell, and, suffered, injuries, the, plaintiff, might, be, able, to, sue, either, the, employee, or, the, employer, there, is, considerable, academic, debate, about, whether, vicarious, liability, is, justified, on, no, better, basis, than, the, search, for, a, solvent, defendant, or, whether, it, is, well, founded, on, the, theory, of, efficient, risk, allocation, absolute, liability, under, the, rule, in, m, c, mehta, v, union, of, india, in, indian, tort, law, is, a, unique, outgrowth, of, the, doctrine, of, strict, liability, for, ultrahazardous, activities, under, the, precedent, established, in, the, english, case, of, rylands, v, fletcher, upon, which, the, indian, doctrine, of, absolute, liability, is, based, anyone, who, in, the, course, of, non, natural, use, of, his, land, accumulates, thereon, for, his, own, purposes, anything, likely, to, cause, mischief, if, it, escapes, is, answerable, for, all, direct, damage, thereby, caused, while, in, england, and, many, other, common, law, jurisdictions, this, precedent, is, used, to, impose, strict, liability, on, certain, areas, of, nuisance, law, and, is, strictly, a, remedy, for, damage, to, land, or, interests, in, land, under, which, damages, for, personal, injuries, are, not, recoverable, indian, courts, have, developed, this, rule, into, a, distinct, principle, of, absolute, liability, where, an, enterprise, is, absolutely, liable, without, exceptions, to, compensate, everyone, affected, by, any, accident, resulting, from, the, operation, of, hazardous, activity, this, differs, greatly, from, the, english, approach, as, it, includes, all, kinds, of, resulting, liability, rather, than, being, limited, to, damage, to, land, in, new, zealand, the, tort, system, for, the, majority, of, personal, injuries, was, scrapped, with, the, establishment, of, the, accident, compensation, corporation, a, universal, system, of, no, fault, insurance, the, rationale, underlying, new, zealand, s, elimination, of, personal, injury, torts, was, securing, equality, of, treatment, for, victims, regardless, of, whether, or, the, extent, to, which, they, or, any, other, party, was, at, fault, this, was, the, basis, for, much, of, professor, patrick, atiyah, s, scholarship, as, articulated, in, accidents, compensation, and, the, law, 1970, originally, his, proposal, was, the, gradual, abolition, of, tort, actions, and, its, replacement, with, schemes, like, those, for, industrial, injuries, to, cover, for, all, illness, disability, and, disease, whether, caused, by, people, or, nature, in, addition, to, the, development, of, the, accident, compensation, corporation, to, eliminate, personal, injury, lawsuits, the, tort, system, for, medical, malpractice, was, scrapped, in, new, zealand, both, following, recommendations, from, the, royal, commission, in, 1967, for, no, fault, compensation, scheme, see, the, woodhouse, report, in, the, case, of, the, united, states, a, survey, of, trial, lawyers, identified, several, modern, innovations, that, developed, after, the, divergence, of, english, and, american, tort, law, including, strict, liability, for, products, based, on, greenman, v, yuba, power, products, the, limitation, of, various, immunities, e, g, sovereign, immunity, charitable, immunity, comparative, negligence, broader, rules, for, admitting, evidence, increased, damages, for, emotional, distress, and, toxic, torts, and, class, action, lawsuits, however, there, has, also, been, a, reaction, in, terms, of, tort, reform, which, in, some, cases, have, been, struck, down, as, violating, state, constitutions, and, federal, preemption, of, state, laws, torts, may, be, categorised, in, several, ways, with, a, particularly, common, division, between, negligent, and, intentional, torts, quasi, torts, are, unusual, tort, actions, particularly, in, the, united, states, collateral, tort, is, used, to, refer, to, torts, in, labour, law, such, as, intentional, infliction, of, emotional, distress, outrage, or, wrongful, dismissal, these, evolving, causes, of, action, are, debated, and, overlap, with, contract, law, or, other, legal, areas, to, some, degree, in, some, cases, the, development, of, tort, law, has, spurred, lawmakers, to, create, alternative, solutions, to, disputes, for, example, in, some, areas, workers, compensation, laws, arose, as, a, legislative, response, to, court, rulings, restricting, the, extent, to, which, employees, could, sue, their, employers, in, respect, of, injuries, sustained, during, employment, in, other, cases, legal, commentary, has, led, to, the, development, of, new, causes, of, action, outside, the, traditional, common, law, torts, these, are, loosely, grouped, into, quasi, torts, or, liability, torts, the, tort, of, negligence, is, a, cause, of, action, leading, to, relief, designed, to, protect, legal, rights, from, actions, which, although, unintentional, nevertheless, cause, some, form, of, legal, harm, to, the, plaintiff, in, order, to, win, an, action, for, negligence, a, plaintiff, must, prove, duty, breach, of, duty, causation, scope, of, liability, and, damages, further, a, defendant, may, assert, various, defences, to, a, plaintiff, s, case, including, comparative, fault, and, assumption, of, risk, negligence, is, a, tort, which, arises, from, the, breach, of, the, duty, of, care, owed, by, one, person, to, another, from, the, perspective, of, a, reasonable, person, although, credited, as, appearing, in, the, united, states, in, brown, v, kendall, the, later, scottish, case, of, donoghue, v, stevenson, ac, 562, followed, in, england, brought, england, into, line, with, the, united, states, and, established, the, tort, of, negligence, as, opposed, to, negligence, as, a, component, in, specific, actions, in, donoghue, mrs, donoghue, drank, from, an, opaque, bottle, containing, a, decomposed, snail, and, claimed, that, it, had, made, her, ill, she, could, not, sue, mr, stevenson, for, damages, for, breach, of, contract, and, instead, sued, for, negligence, the, majority, determined, that, the, definition, of, negligence, can, be, divided, into, four, component, parts, that, the, plaintiff, must, prove, to, establish, negligence, in, most, common, law, jurisdictions, there, are, four, elements, to, a, negligence, action, some, jurisdictions, narrow, the, definition, down, to, three, elements, duty, breach, and, proximately, caused, harm, some, jurisdictions, recognize, five, elements, duty, breach, actual, cause, proximate, cause, and, damages, however, at, their, heart, the, various, definitions, of, what, constitutes, negligent, conduct, are, very, similar, depending, on, jurisdiction, product, liability, cases, such, as, those, involving, warranties, may, be, considered, negligence, actions, or, fall, under, a, separate, category, of, strict, liability, torts, similarly, cases, involving, environmental, or, consumer, health, torts, which, other, countries, treat, as, negligence, or, strict, liability, torts, are, treated, in, india, as, absolute, liability, torts, in, establishing, whether, a, duty, of, care, exists, different, common, law, jurisdictions, have, developed, a, variety, of, distinct, but, related, approaches, with, many, jurisdictions, building, on, the, test, established, in, anns, v, merton, lbc, in, singapore, the, current, leading, case, is, spandeck, engineering, v, defence, science, and, technology, agency, which, builds, on, anns, by, establishing, a, two, step, test, comprising, an, analysis, of, proximate, cause, and, public, policy, as, a, universal, test, independent, from, the, individual, circumstances, of, a, given, case, for, determining, the, existence, of, a, duty, of, care, the, supreme, court, of, canada, established, a, similar, test, in, the, context, of, assessing, damages, for, pure, economic, loss, owing, to, negligence, derived, from, anns, which, consists, of, a, two, step, examination, of, the, existence, of, a, sufficiently, proximate, relationship, between, the, parties, and, public, policy, considerations, however, the, canadian, test, is, more, sensitive, to, the, individual, circumstances, of, a, given, case, and, the, first, step, is, generally, deemed, to, be, met, where, a, case, falls, into, one, of, three, sets, of, circumstances, recognised, by, precedent, while, the, singaporean, test, is, independent, of, precedent, in, english, tort, law, caparo, industries, plc, v, dickman, established, a, tripartite, test, for, the, existence, of, a, duty, of, care, per, which, harm, must, be, reasonably, foreseeable, as, a, potential, result, of, the, defendant, s, conduct, the, parties, must, be, in, a, relationship, of, proximity, and, it, must, be, fair, just, and, reasonable, to, impose, such, a, duty, intentional, torts, are, any, intentional, acts, that, are, reasonably, foreseeable, to, cause, harm, to, an, individual, and, that, do, so, intentional, torts, have, several, subcategories, an, intentional, tort, requires, an, overt, act, some, form, of, intent, and, causation, in, most, cases, transferred, intent, which, occurs, when, the, defendant, intends, to, injure, an, individual, but, actually, ends, up, injuring, another, individual, will, satisfy, the, intent, requirement, causation, can, be, satisfied, as, long, as, the, defendant, was, a, substantial, factor, in, causing, the, harm, nuisance, is, traditionally, used, to, describe, an, activity, which, is, harmful, or, annoying, to, others, such, as, indecent, conduct, or, a, rubbish, heap, nuisances, either, affect, private, individuals, private, nuisance, or, the, general, public, public, nuisance, the, claimant, can, sue, for, most, acts, that, interfere, with, their, use, and, enjoyment, of, their, land, in, english, law, whether, activity, was, an, illegal, nuisance, depended, upon, the, area, and, whether, the, activity, was, for, the, benefit, of, the, commonwealth, with, richer, areas, subject, to, a, greater, expectation, of, cleanliness, and, quiet, the, case, jones, v, powell, 1629, provides, an, early, example, in, which, a, person, s, professional, papers, were, damaged, by, the, vapors, of, a, neighboring, brewery, although, the, outcome, of, this, case, is, unclear, whitelocke, of, the, court, of, the, king, s, bench, is, recorded, as, saying, that, since, the, water, supply, in, area, was, already, contaminated, the, nuisance, was, not, actionable, as, it, is, better, that, they, should, be, spoiled, than, that, the, commonwealth, stand, in, need, of, good, liquor, in, english, law, a, related, category, of, tort, liability, was, created, in, the, case, of, rylands, v, fletcher, 1868, strict, liability, was, established, for, a, dangerous, escape, of, some, hazard, including, water, fire, or, animals, as, long, as, the, cause, was, not, remote, in, cambridge, water, co, ltd, v, eastern, counties, leather, plc, 1994, chemicals, from, a, factory, seeped, through, a, floor, into, the, water, table, contaminating, east, anglia, s, water, reservoirs, the, rylands, rule, remains, in, use, in, england, and, wales, in, australian, law, it, has, been, merged, into, negligence, economic, torts, typically, involve, commercial, transactions, and, include, tortious, interference, with, trade, or, contract, fraud, injurious, falsehood, and, negligent, misrepresentation, negligent, misrepresentation, torts, are, distinct, from, contractual, cases, involving, misrepresentation, in, that, there, is, no, privity, of, contract, these, torts, are, likely, to, involve, pure, economic, loss, which, has, been, less, commonly, recoverable, in, tort, one, criterion, for, determining, whether, economic, loss, is, recoverable, is, the, foreseeability, doctrine, the, economic, loss, rule, is, highly, confusing, and, inconsistently, applied, and, began, in, 1965, from, a, california, case, involving, strict, liability, for, product, defects, in, 1986, the, u, s, supreme, court, adopted, the, doctrine, in, east, river, s, s, corp, v, transamerica, deleval, inc, in, 2010, the, supreme, court, of, the, u, s, state, of, washington, replaced, the, economic, loss, doctrine, with, an, independent, duty, doctrine, economic, antitrust, torts, have, been, somewhat, submerged, by, modern, competition, law, however, in, the, united, states, private, parties, are, permitted, in, certain, circumstances, to, sue, for, anticompetitive, practices, including, under, federal, or, state, statutes, or, on, the, basis, of, common, law, tortious, interference, which, may, be, based, upon, the, restatement, second, of, torts, 766, negligent, misrepresentation, as, tort, where, no, contractual, privity, exists, was, disallowed, in, england, by, derry, v, peek, however, this, position, was, overturned, in, hedley, byrne, v, heller, in, 1964, so, that, such, actions, were, allowed, if, a, special, relationship, existed, between, the, plaintiff, and, defendant, united, states, courts, and, scholars, paid, lip, service, to, derry, however, scholars, such, as, william, prosser, argued, that, it, was, misinterpreted, by, english, courts, the, case, of, ultramares, corporation, v, touche, 1932, limited, the, liability, of, an, auditor, to, known, identified, beneficiaries, of, the, audit, and, this, rule, was, widely, applied, in, the, united, states, until, the, 1960s, the, restatement, second, of, torts, expanded, liability, to, foreseeable, users, rather, than, specifically, identified, foreseen, users, of, the, information, dramatically, expanding, liability, and, affecting, professionals, such, as, accountants, architects, attorneys, and, surveyors, as, of, 1989, most, u, s, jurisdictions, follow, either, the, ultramares, approach, or, the, restatement, approach, the, tort, of, deceit, for, inducement, into, a, contract, is, a, tort, in, english, law, but, in, practice, has, been, replaced, by, actions, under, misrepresentation, act, 1967, in, the, united, states, similar, torts, existed, but, have, become, superseded, to, some, degree, by, contract, law, and, the, pure, economic, loss, rule, historically, and, to, some, degree, today, fraudulent, but, not, negligent, misrepresentation, involving, damages, for, economic, loss, may, be, awarded, under, the, benefit, of, the, bargain, rule, damages, identical, to, expectation, damages, in, contracts, which, awards, the, plaintiff, the, difference, between, the, value, represented, and, the, actual, value, beginning, with, stiles, v, white, 1846, in, massachusetts, this, rule, spread, across, the, country, as, a, majority, rule, with, the, out, of, pocket, damages, rule, as, a, minority, rule, although, the, damages, under, the, benefit, of, the, bargain, are, described, as, compensatory, the, plaintiff, is, left, better, off, than, before, the, transaction, since, the, economic, loss, rule, would, eliminate, these, benefits, if, applied, strictly, there, is, an, exception, to, allow, the, misrepresentation, tort, if, not, related, to, a, contract, the, remedies, and, defences, available, in, common, law, jurisdictions, are, typically, similar, deriving, from, judicial, precedent, with, occasional, legislative, intervention, compensation, by, way, of, damages, is, typically, the, default, remedy, available, to, plaintiffs, with, injunctions, and, specific, performance, being, relatively, rare, in, tort, law, cases, relatively, uniquely, for, a, common, law, jurisdiction, singapore, s, community, disputes, resolution, act, 2015, cdra, alters, the, common, law, by, codifying, a, statutory, tort, of, interference, with, enjoyment, or, use, of, place, of, residence, and, provides, for, a, variety, of, remedies, beyond, damages, ranging, from, injunctions, and, specific, performance, to, court, ordered, apologies, where, a, court, order, providing, for, a, remedy, other, than, damages, is, awarded, under, the, cdra, is, violated, sections, 5, 8, of, the, act, require, that, the, plaintiff, apply, for, a, special, direction, to, be, issued, in, order, to, enforce, the, original, remedy, and, section, 9, provides, that, failure, to, comply, with, a, special, direction, is, grounds, for, the, court, to, issue, an, order, excluding, the, tortfeasor, from, their, residence, aside, from, legislatively, created, remedies, such, as, the, cdra, courts, in, common, law, jurisdictions, will, typically, provide, for, damages, which, depending, on, jurisdiction, may, include, punitive, damages, but, judges, will, issue, injunctions, and, specific, performance, where, they, deem, damages, not, to, be, a, sufficient, remedy, legislatures, in, various, common, law, jurisdictions, have, curtailed, the, ability, of, judges, to, award, punitive, or, other, non, economic, damages, through, the, use, of, non, economic, damages, caps, and, other, tort, reform, measures, apart, from, proof, that, there, was, no, breach, of, duty, in, other, words, that, a, tortious, act, was, not, committed, in, the, first, place, there, are, three, principal, defences, to, tortious, liability, in, common, law, jurisdictions, discovery, or, disclosure, a, concept, unique, to, common, law, jurisdictions, is, a, pre, trial, procedure, in, a, lawsuit, in, which, each, party, through, the, law, of, civil, procedure, can, open, endedly, demand, evidence, from, the, other, party, or, parties, by, means, of, discovery, devices, such, as, interrogatories, requests, for, production, of, documents, requests, for, admissions, and, depositions, discovery, can, be, obtained, from, non, parties, using, subpoenas, when, a, discovery, request, is, objected, to, the, requesting, party, may, seek, the, assistance, of, the, court, by, filing, a, motion, to, compel, discovery, in, tort, litigation, the, availability, of, discovery, enables, plaintiffs, to, essentially, carry, out, a, private, investigation, subpoenaing, records, and, documents, from, the, defendant, consequently, commentators, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, regard, discovery, destructive, of, the, rule, of, law, and, as, a, private, inquisition, civil, law, countries, see, the, underlying, objectives, of, discovery, as, properly, monopolised, by, the, state, in, order, to, maintain, the, rule, of, law, the, investigative, objective, of, discovery, is, the, prerogative, of, the, executive, branch, and, insofar, as, discovery, may, be, able, to, facilitate, the, creation, of, new, rights, that, is, the, prerogative, of, the, legislative, branch, the, availability, of, discovery, in, common, law, jurisdictions, means, that, plaintiffs, who, in, other, jurisdictions, would, not, have, sufficient, evidence, upon, which, to, file, a, tort, claim, are, able, to, do, so, in, the, hope, that, they, will, be, able, to, obtain, sufficient, evidence, through, discovery, the, primary, drawbacks, of, this, are, that, on, one, hand, it, creates, the, possibility, that, a, plaintiff, filing, suit, in, good, faith, may, not, find, enough, evidence, to, succeed, and, incur, legal, expenses, driven, upward, due, to, the, cost, of, discovery, and, on, the, other, hand, that, it, enables, plaintiffs, arguing, in, bad, faith, to, initiate, frivolous, tort, lawsuits, and, coerce, defendants, into, agreeing, to, legal, settlements, in, otherwise, unmeritorious, actions, among, common, law, countries, today, there, are, significant, differences, in, tort, law, common, law, systems, include, united, states, tort, law, australian, tort, law, canadian, tort, law, indian, tort, law, and, the, tort, law, of, a, variety, of, jurisdictions, in, asia, and, africa, there, is, a, more, apparent, split, in, tort, law, between, the, commonwealth, countries, and, the, united, states, despite, diverging, from, english, common, law, in, 1776, earlier, than, the, other, common, law, jurisdictions, united, states, tort, law, was, influenced, by, english, law, and, blackstone, s, commentaries, with, several, state, constitutions, specifically, providing, for, redress, for, torts, in, addition, to, reception, statutes, which, adopted, english, law, however, tort, law, globally, was, viewed, as, relatively, undeveloped, by, the, mid, 19th, century, the, first, american, treatise, on, torts, was, published, in, the, 1860s, but, the, subject, became, particularly, established, when, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, wrote, on, the, subject, in, the, 1880s, holmes, writings, have, been, described, as, the, first, serious, attempt, in, the, common, law, world, to, give, torts, both, a, coherent, structure, and, a, distinctive, substantive, domain, although, holmes, summary, of, the, history, of, torts, has, been, critically, reviewed, the, 1928, us, case, of, palsgraf, v, long, island, railroad, co, heavily, influenced, the, british, judges, in, the, 1932, house, of, lords, case, of, donoghue, v, stevenson, the, united, states, has, since, been, perceived, as, particularly, prone, to, filing, tort, lawsuits, even, relative, to, other, common, law, countries, although, this, perception, has, been, criticised, and, debated, 20th, century, academics, have, identified, that, class, actions, were, relatively, uncommon, outside, of, the, united, states, noting, that, the, english, law, was, less, generous, to, the, plaintiff, in, the, following, ways, contingent, fee, arrangements, were, restricted, english, judges, tried, more, decisions, and, set, damages, rather, than, juries, wrongful, death, lawsuits, were, relatively, restricted, punitive, damages, were, relatively, unavailable, the, collateral, source, rule, was, restricted, and, strict, liability, such, as, for, product, liability, was, relatively, unavailable, the, english, welfare, state, which, provides, free, healthcare, to, victims, of, injury, may, explain, the, lower, tendency, towards, personal, injury, lawsuits, in, england, a, similar, observation, has, also, been, made, with, regard, to, australia, while, indian, tort, law, is, generally, derived, from, english, law, there, are, certain, differences, between, the, two, systems, indian, tort, law, uniquely, includes, remedies, for, constitutional, torts, which, are, actions, by, the, government, that, infringe, upon, rights, enshrined, in, the, constitution, as, well, as, a, system, of, absolute, liability, for, businesses, engaged, in, hazardous, activity, as, outlined, in, the, rule, in, m, c, mehta, v, union, of, india, similar, to, other, common, law, jurisdictions, conduct, which, gives, rise, to, a, cause, of, action, under, tort, law, is, additionally, criminalised, by, the, indian, penal, code, which, was, originally, enacted, in, 1860, as, a, result, of, the, influence, of, its, relatively, early, codification, of, criminal, law, the, torts, of, assault, battery, and, false, imprisonment, are, interpreted, by, indian, courts, and, the, courts, of, jurisdictions, that, were, formerly, part, of, the, british, indian, empire, e, g, pakistan, bangladesh, and, british, colonies, in, south, east, asia, which, adopted, the, indian, penal, code, i, e, singapore, malaysia, and, brunei, with, reference, to, analogous, crimes, outlined, in, the, code, for, instance, assault, is, interpreted, in, the, context, of, s, 351, per, which, the, following, criteria, constitute, assault, similarly, battery, is, interpreted, in, the, context, of, criminal, force, as, outlined, in, s, 350, an, area, of, tort, unique, to, india, is, the, constitutional, tort, a, public, law, remedy, for, violations, of, rights, generally, by, agents, of, the, state, and, is, implicitly, premised, on, the, strict, liability, principle, in, practice, constitutional, torts, in, india, serve, the, role, served, by, administrative, courts, in, many, civil, law, jurisdictions, and, much, of, the, function, of, constitutional, review, in, other, jurisdictions, thereby, functioning, as, a, branch, of, administrative, law, rather, than, private, law, rather, than, developing, principles, of, administrative, fairness, as, a, distinct, branch, of, law, as, other, common, law, jurisdictions, have, indian, courts, have, thus, extended, tort, law, as, it, applies, between, private, parties, to, address, unlawful, administrative, and, legislative, action, within, canada, s, common, law, provinces, there, is, currently, no, consistent, approach, to, the, tort, of, invasion, of, privacy, four, provinces, british, columbia, manitoba, newfoundland, and, saskatchewan, have, created, a, statutory, tort, ontario, has, recognised, the, existence, of, the, tort, of, intrusion, upon, seclusion, which, has, also, been, held, to, exist, under, tort, law, in, the, united, states, british, columbia, on, the, other, hand, has, held, that, the, tort, does, not, exist, in, that, province, under, the, common, law, like, the, united, kingdom, and, british, columbia, but, unlike, ontario, and, most, jurisdictions, in, the, united, states, indian, tort, law, does, not, traditionally, recognise, a, common, law, tort, of, invasion, of, privacy, or, intrusion, on, seclusion, nevertheless, there, is, a, shift, in, jurisprudence, toward, recognising, breech, of, confidentiality, as, an, actionable, civil, wrong, proponents, of, protection, for, privacy, under, indian, tort, law, argue, that, the, right, to, privacy, is, implicit, in, article, 21, of, the, constitution, of, india, which, guarantees, protections, for, personal, liberties, despite, the, lack, of, a, tort, addressing, violations, of, privacy, by, private, individuals, the, supreme, court, recognised, privacy, as, a, constitutional, right, in, 2017, similarly, neither, intentional, infliction, of, emotional, distress, iied, nor, negligent, infliction, of, emotional, distress, nied, is, recognised, as, a, tort, in, indian, jurisprudence, while, claims, seeking, damages, for, infliction, of, emotional, distress, were, historically, an, accessory, claim, in, a, tort, action, alleging, another, distinct, tort, the, doctrine, has, evolved, in, north, america, into, a, stand, alone, tort, while, english, jurisprudence, has, evolved, to, typically, recognise, only, recognised, psychiatric, injuries, as, grounds, for, compensation, indian, courts, while, recognising, the, infliction, of, emotional, distress, regardless, of, intention, as, an, actionable, wrong, in, matrimonial, disputes, typically, follow, the, english, approach, although, case, law, from, both, the, united, kingdom, and, north, america, is, frequently, employed, by, judges, ruling, on, cases, in, which, damages, for, mental, distress, are, sought, both, scots, and, roman, dutch, law, are, uncodified, scholarship, driven, and, judge, made, legal, systems, based, on, roman, law, as, historically, applied, in, the, netherlands, and, scotland, during, the, enlightenment, in, both, legal, systems, when, applied, in, english, speaking, countries, the, term, delict, is, used, to, refer, to, tortious, liability, unlike, for, instance, in, spain, where, the, cognate, of, the, term, delict, refers, to, a, criminal, offence, unlike, in, systems, based, on, civil, codes, or, on, the, english, common, law, scots, and, roman, dutch, law, operate, on, broad, principles, of, liability, for, wrongdoing, there, is, no, exhaustive, list, of, named, delicts, in, either, system, if, the, conduct, complained, of, appears, to, be, wrongful, the, law, will, afford, a, remedy, even, in, the, absence, of, precedent, pertaining, to, similar, conduct, in, south, africa, and, neighbouring, countries, the, roman, dutch, law, of, delict, is, in, force, having, been, preserved, after, the, united, kingdom, annexed, dutch, settlements, in, south, africa, and, spread, as, neighbouring, british, colonies, adopted, south, african, law, via, reception, statutes, roman, dutch, law, also, forms, the, basis, for, the, legal, system, of, sri, lanka, the, elements, of, a, delict, as, follows, the, elements, of, harm, and, conduct, are, fact, based, inquiries, while, causation, is, part, factual, and, part, normative, and, wrongfulness, and, fault, are, entirely, normative, that, is, value, based, in, that, they, articulate, a, wider, societal, policy, perspective, delict, is, inherently, a, flexible, set, of, principles, that, embody, social, policy, under, the, scots, and, roman, dutch, law, of, delict, there, are, two, main, remedies, available, to, plaintiffs, protected, interests, which, can, give, rise, to, delictual, liability, can, be, broadly, divided, into, two, categories, patrimonial, and, non, patrimonial, interests, patrimonial, interests, are, those, which, pertain, to, damages, to, an, individual, s, body, or, property, which, both, scots, and, roman, dutch, law, approach, in, the, context, of, the, roman, lex, aquilia, non, patrimonial, interests, include, dignitary, and, personality, related, interests, e, g, defamation, disfigurement, unjust, imprisonment, which, cannot, be, exhaustively, listed, which, are, addressed, in, the, context, of, the, roman, actio, iniuriarum, as, well, as, pain, and, suffering, which, are, addressed, under, jurisprudence, that, has, developed, in, modern, times, in, general, where, an, individual, violates, a, patrimonial, interest, they, will, incur, aquilian, liability, and, where, an, individual, violates, a, non, patrimonial, interest, they, will, incur, liability, stemming, from, the, actio, iniuriarum, while, broadly, similar, due, to, their, common, origin, the, nature, of, the, remedies, available, under, contemporary, scots, and, roman, dutch, law, vary, slightly, although, the, aquilian, action, and, actio, iniuriarum, are, the, primary, remedies, available, under, both, systems, the, primary, difference, between, the, two, remedies, is, that, the, aquilian, action, serves, a, compensatory, function, i, e, providing, economic, damages, to, restore, the, plaintiff, to, their, previous, state, while, the, actio, iniuriarum, provides, for, non, economic, damages, aimed, at, providing, solace, to, the, plaintiff, in, roman, dutch, law, but, not, in, scots, law, there, is, also, a, distinct, action, for, pain, and, suffering, relating, to, pain, and, suffering, and, psychiatric, injury, which, provides, for, non, economic, damages, similar, to, those, under, the, actio, iniuriarum, the, various, delictual, actions, are, not, mutually, exclusive, it, is, possible, for, a, person, to, suffer, various, forms, of, harm, at, the, same, time, which, means, that, a, person, may, simultaneously, claim, remedies, under, more, than, one, action, the, elements, of, liability, under, the, actio, iniuriarum, are, as, follows, there, are, five, essential, elements, for, liability, in, terms, of, the, actio, legis, aquiliae, in, scots, law, the, aquilian, action, has, developed, more, expansively, and, may, be, invoked, as, a, remedy, for, both, patrimonial, and, certain, types, of, non, patrimonial, loss, particularly, with, regard, to, personal, injury, by, way, of, a, legal, fiction, personal, injury, is, treated, as, physical, damage, done, with, the, net, effect, that, the, actio, injuriarum, root, of, scots, law, infuses, the, delict, assault, as, much, as, any, development, of, the, lex, aquilia, and, wrongdoing, that, results, in, physical, harm, to, a, person, may, give, rise, to, both, an, aquilian, action, and, an, actio, iniuriarum, additionally, the, modern, scots, law, pertaining, to, reparation, for, negligent, wrongdoing, is, based, on, the, lex, aquilia, and, so, affords, reparation, in, instances, of, damnum, injuria, datum, literally, loss, wrongfully, caused, with, the, wrongdoing, in, such, instances, generated, by, the, defender, s, culpa, i, e, fault, in, any, instance, in, which, a, pursuer, a, has, suffered, loss, at, the, hands, of, the, wrongful, conduct, of, the, defender, b, b, is, under, a, legal, obligation, to, make, reparation, if, b, s, wrongdoing, were, intentional, in, the, circumstances, or, so, reckless, that, an, intention, may, be, constructively, inferred, on, the, basis, that, culpa, lata, dolo, aequiparatur, gross, fault, is, the, same, as, intentional, wrongdoing, then, it, follows, axiomatically, that, b, will, be, liable, to, repair, any, damage, done, to, a, s, property, person, or, economic, interest, wherever, a, defender, intentionally, harms, the, pursuer, provided, the, interest, harmed, is, regarded, as, reparable, the, defender, incurs, delictual, liability, if, the, pursuer, has, suffered, loss, as, the, result, of, the, defender, s, conduct, yet, the, defender, did, not, intend, to, harm, the, pursuer, nor, behave, so, recklessly, that, intent, might, be, constructively, inferred, the, pursuer, must, demonstrate, that, the, defender, s, conduct, was, negligent, in, order, to, win, their, case, negligence, can, be, established, by, the, pursuer, by, demonstrating, that, the, defender, owed, to, them, a, duty, of, care, which, they, ultimately, breached, by, failing, to, live, up, to, the, expected, standard, of, care, if, this, can, be, shown, then, the, pursuer, must, also, establish, that, the, defender, s, failure, to, live, up, to, the, expected, standard, of, care, ultimately, caused, the, loss, damnum, complained, of, there, is, a, distinction, between, defences, aimed, at, the, wrongfulness, element, and, defences, which, serve, to, exclude, fault, grounds, of, justification, may, be, described, as, circumstances, which, occur, typically, or, regularly, in, practice, and, which, indicate, conclusively, that, interference, with, a, person, s, legally, protected, interests, is, reasonable, and, therefore, lawful, they, are, practical, examples, of, circumstances, justifying, a, prima, fade, infringement, of, a, recognised, right, or, interest, according, to, the, fundamental, criterion, of, reasonableness, they, are, another, expression, of, the, legal, convictions, of, the, society, consent, to, injury, or, volenti, non, fit, injuria, is, a, full, defence, if, successful, there, is, no, delict, as, a, general, defence, it, can, take, two, forms, there, are, five, requirements, for, the, defence, of, consent, necessity, is, conduct, directed, at, an, innocent, person, as, a, result, of, duress, or, compulsion, or, a, threat, by, a, third, party, or, an, outside, force, private, defence, or, self, defence, is, conduct, directed, at, the, person, responsible, for, the, duress, or, compulsion, or, threat, there, is, therefore, an, important, distinction, between, the, two, in, cases, of, necessity, and, private, defence, the, question, is, this, under, which, circumstances, would, the, legal, convictions, of, the, community, consider, it, reasonable, to, inflict, harm, to, prevent, it, the, test, is, objective, it, requires, a, balancing, of, the, parties, and, of, society, s, interests, the, role, of, the, person, against, whom, the, defensive, conduct, is, directed, is, an, important, factor, in, determining, whether, defence, or, necessity, is, being, pled, an, act, of, necessity, is, calculated, to, avert, harm, by, inflicting, it, on, an, innocent, person, whereas, an, act, of, defence, is, always, directed, at, a, wrongdoer, a, person, acts, in, private, defence, and, therefore, lawfully, when, he, uses, force, to, ward, off, an, unlawful, attack, against, his, or, someone, else, s, property, or, person, a, person, acts, in, self, defence, when, he, defends, his, own, body, against, unlawful, attack, by, someone, else, one, therefore, cannot, invoke, the, justification, of, self, defence, when, acting, in, the, interests, of, another, person, but, it, is, possible, to, invoke, the, justification, of, private, defence, when, acting, in, one, s, own, interests, conduct, will, be, justified, as, an, act, in, private, defence, or, self, defence, if, it, is, the, violence, used, in, defence, must, not, exceed, what, is, reasonably, necessary, to, avert, the, threatened, danger, an, act, of, necessity, may, be, described, as, lawful, conduct, directed, against, an, innocent, person, for, the, purpose, of, protecting, an, interest, of, the, actor, or, of, a, third, party, including, the, innocent, person, against, a, dangerous, situation, which, may, have, arisen, owing, to, the, wrongful, conduct, of, another, or, the, behaviour, of, an, animal, or, through, natural, forces, two, types, of, emergency, situations, may, be, found, civil, and, criminal, law, were, not, clearly, delineated, in, ancient, chinese, law, as, they, are, in, modern, legal, systems, therefore, while, tort, law, was, not, a, distinct, area, of, law, concepts, familiar, to, tort, law, were, present, in, the, criminal, laws, however, by, the, late, feudalism, period, personal, injury, and, property, damage, torts, were, mostly, focused, on, compensation, the, earliest, tort, case, known, from, ancient, china, is, from, the, zhou, dynasty, during, a, famine, one, person, robbed, another, s, barn, by, sending, his, slave, to, steal, the, grain, he, was, sued, and, the, court, ordered, double, the, original, grain, restored, to, the, victim, to, compensate, the, damages, the, qin, code, made, some, changes, to, tort, liabilities, introducing, the, concept, of, subjective, fault, fault, liability, in, a, case, where, one, person, borrows, farm, equipment, compensation, would, be, required, for, damage, to, the, equipment, if, the, damage, is, caused, by, the, condition, of, the, equipment, when, it, was, borrowed, in, addition, to, fault, liability, some, defences, were, developed, a, person, would, not, be, liable, if, public, property, were, damaged, by, fire, or, other, natural, forces, outside, the, person, s, control, there, was, no, liability, for, killing, livestock, if, the, livestock, was, about, to, hurt, someone, in, contemporary, china, however, there, are, four, distinct, legal, systems, in, force, none, of, which, are, derived, from, classical, chinese, law, portuguese, civil, law, in, macau, common, law, in, hong, kong, a, german, style, civil, law, system, adopted, by, the, republic, of, china, following, japan, s, model, and, a, primarily, civil, law, system, in, the, mainland, in, areas, administered, by, the, republic, of, china, the, legislative, basis, of, tort, law, is, the, civil, code, of, the, republic, of, china, whose, legal, system, was, modelled, after, the, japanese, six, codes, system, which, itself, was, primarily, based, on, the, german, pandectist, approach, to, law, in, general, article, 184, provides, that, a, person, who, intentionally, or, negligently, damages, another, person, s, rights, is, required, to, compensate, them, for, any, resulting, injury, and, provides, for, strict, liability, where, such, harm, is, caused, by, the, violation, of, a, statutory, provision, aimed, at, protecting, members, of, the, community, from, harm, additionally, tort, liability, exists, for, the, owner, of, a, defective, building, or, structure, where, such, building, or, structure, causes, damage, for, the, driver, of, an, automobile, that, causes, injury, and, for, individual, s, responsible, for, business, activities, that, posed, a, risk, of, harm, to, the, plaintiff, tort, liability, in, the, republic, of, china, also, extends, to, the, violation, of, certain, non, pecuniary, interests, under, article, 195, which, provides, for, reasonable, compensation, in, the, case, of, damage, to, the, body, health, reputation, liberty, credit, privacy, or, chastity, of, another, or, to, another, s, personality, in, a, severe, way, in, 2021, the, mainland, adopted, the, civil, code, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, ccprc, book, seven, of, which, is, titled, tort, liability, and, codifies, a, variety, of, torts, providing, that, an, individual, who, through, his, fault, infringes, upon, another, person, s, civil, law, rights, and, interests, shall, bear, tort, liability, book, seven, outlines, seven, distinct, categories, of, torts, while, book, seven, titled, tort, liability, of, the, ccprc, which, is, influenced, by, a, variety, of, common, law, and, civil, law, jurisdictions, codifies, the, torts, which, exist, under, the, law, of, mainland, china, book, one, of, the, ccprc, provides, a, comprehensive, list, of, remedies, for, torts, in, article, 179, these, remedies, apply, to, all, categories, of, torts, outlined, in, book, seven, or, by, any, other, provision, of, law, to, this, end, book, seven, specifically, provides, that, where, a, tortious, act, endangers, another, person, s, personal, or, property, safety, the, infringed, person, has, the, right, to, request, the, tortfeasor, to, bear, tort, liability, such, as, cessation, of, the, infringement, removal, of, the, nuisance, or, elimination, of, the, danger, book, one, additionally, provides, that, force, majeure, constitutes, a, valid, defence, for, tort, liability, while, article, 184, in, that, book, is, a, good, samaritan, law, eliminating, liability, under, tort, law, for, individuals, acting, to, save, or, rescue, a, potential, plaintiff, article, 1176, in, book, seven, provides, a, partial, defence, where, an, injury, is, caused, in, the, course, of, a, sport, in, which, the, plaintiff, was, consensually, participating, tort, liability, in, france, responsabilit, extracontractuelle, is, a, distinct, system, which, has, developed, over, the, course, of, history, stemming, from, the, napoleonic, code, which, together, with, the, german, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, forms, the, basis, for, private, law, in, the, majority, of, civil, law, countries, with, civil, codes, french, tort, law, is, based, on, the, principle, that, all, injuries, and, other, wrongs, give, rise, to, a, remedy, typically, in, the, form, of, damages, regardless, of, any, other, moral, or, equitable, considerations, nevertheless, there, are, limits, on, the, types, of, injuries, which, give, rise, to, a, remedy, as, well, as, the, extent, to, which, damages, may, be, claimed, french, jurisprudence, has, established, that, in, order, to, attract, a, remedy, an, injury, should, generally, be, certain, and, direct, prohibiting, speculative, damages, or, compensation, for, pure, economic, loss, and, affect, a, legitimate, interest, however, judges, do, not, recognise, a, hard, and, fast, rule, meaning, that, great, weight, is, given, to, the, specific, circumstances, in, each, case, with, precedent, serving, to, guide, rather, than, control, jurisprudence, the, main, principle, in, french, tort, law, is, that, of, fault, the, principle, that, the, individual, who, causes, damage, ought, generally, to, be, liable, for, it, however, following, the, industrial, revolution, vicarious, liability, and, strict, liability, have, developed, through, both, precedent, and, legislative, action, in, response, to, the, need, to, address, damage, caused, by, products, machines, and, the, actions, of, agents, or, employees, french, tort, law, is, primarily, governed, by, articles, 1240, to, 1245, 17, of, the, civil, code, which, establish, a, number, of, distinct, regimes, for, tort, liability, liability, for, one, s, own, actions, is, governed, by, articles, 1240, and, 1241, while, other, provisions, of, the, code, provide, for, vicarious, and, other, sui, generis, forms, of, liability, in, addition, liability, in, specific, cases, e, g, product, liability, and, defamation, have, been, provided, for, in, separate, statutes, outside, the, code, and, in, european, union, directives, german, tort, law, is, codified, in, book, 2, of, the, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, bgb, which, provides, for, damages, in, circumstances, in, which, there, is, no, contractual, relationship, between, the, plaintiff, and, the, defendant, german, tort, law, protects, plaintiffs, against, violations, of, there, are, three, distinct, categories, of, liability, recognised, under, the, bgb, liability, for, culpable, injustice, injustice, in, rebuttable, presumed, liability, and, strict, liability, arising, from, endangerment, liability, for, culpable, injustice, the, default, position, in, german, tort, law, is, where, an, individual, directly, violates, another, person, s, legal, interest, or, absolute, right, either, intentionally, or, negligently, rebuttable, presumed, liability, is, the, principle, that, an, individual, is, vicariously, liable, where, a, legal, interest, or, absolute, right, is, violated, by, another, person, e, g, an, agent, child, other, person, in, their, custody, where, such, a, violation, is, committed, by, an, animal, or, where, such, a, violation, takes, place, on, the, first, individual, s, property, strict, liability, for, endangerment, exists, with, regard, to, violations, of, protective, laws, e, g, product, liability, environmental, laws, motor, vehicle, regulations, and, in, cases, in, which, an, individual, is, especially, vulnerable, due, to, the, nature, of, a, circumstance, e, g, medical, or, legal, malpractice, the, bgb, makes, specific, provisions, for, several, different, categories, of, torts, pertaining, to, damages, available, including, damages, and, injunctions, to, prevent, the, commission, of, a, tortious, act, these, provisions, are, supplemented, by, specific, legislation, particularly, protective, laws, with, regard, to, product, liability, protective, laws, implementing, european, union, directives, provide, for, a, system, of, strict, liability, similar, to, that, adopted, in, many, common, law, jurisdictions, however, german, tort, law, does, not, recognise, class, action, lawsuits, or, the, notion, of, mass, torts, german, tort, law, additionally, does, not, permit, punitive, damages, in, terms, of, tort, liability, the, bgb, represents, a, school, of, legal, jurisprudence, the, pandectists, heavily, shaped, by, 19th, century, classical, liberalism, and, accordingly, places, great, emphasis, on, minimising, impairment, to, individual, freedom, of, action, in, this, regard, it, can, be, contrasted, with, the, napoleonic, code, which, was, authored, a, century, earlier, and, placed, greater, emphasis, on, the, protection, of, individuals, from, the, actions, of, others, as, the, two, codes, form, the, basis, for, private, law, in, a, variety, of, jurisdictions, across, the, world, with, one, or, the, other, being, substantially, copied, by, most, civil, law, jurisdictions, on, every, continent, the, differences, underpinning, the, bgb, and, the, napoleonic, code, represent, a, major, schism, in, jurisprudence, between, civil, law, jurisdictions, since, 1900, both, the, judges, and, german, legislators, decisively, rejected, the, idea, of, a, general, principle, of, civil, liability, commonly, found, in, civil, codes, inspired, by, the, napoleonic, code, as, well, as, in, those, of, japan, and, the, republic, of, china, which, are, otherwise, based, primarily, on, the, same, pandectist, school, as, the, bgb, and, that, of, the, philippines, one, distinguishing, feature, of, german, law, is, the, extent, to, which, liability, depends, not, just, on, the, damage, caused, but, on, the, action, of, the, purported, tortfeasor, sometimes, it, is, enough, to, prove, negligence, while, in, other, cases, a, more, serious, fault, is, required, thus, anyone, who, unlawfully, interferes, intentionally, or, through, recklessness, with, the, life, body, health, freedom, or, property, of, others, is, liable, to, others, to, repair, the, resulting, damage, on, the, other, hand, less, protection, is, granted, in, the, event, of, damage, to, purely, intangible, interests, nicht, gegenst, ndliche, interessen, that, is, to, say, when, the, victim, only, suffers, purely, economic, or, moral, damage, such, is, the, case, of, a, pecuniary, loss, caused, by, erroneous, information, or, vexatious, remarks, apart, from, a, rather, marginal, hypothesis, provided, for, by, article, 823, paragraph, 2, 9, the, recourse, will, then, suppose, an, intentional, fault, the, protection, thus, granted, has, proven, to, be, incomplete, consequently, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, case, law, has, extended, liability, for, recklessness, to, other, cases, in, particular, by, admitting, that, 823, paragraph, 1, bgb, aims, to, protect, a, general, right, to, personality, and, a, right, to, the, company, or, by, recognising, alongside, tort, liability, the, theory, of, culpa, in, contrahendo, although, boris, starck, makes, no, express, reference, to, it, there, are, serious, reasons, to, think, that, this, right, strongly, inspired, him, in, his, elaboration, of, the, theory, of, the, guarantee, first, it, takes, up, the, idea, of, considering, the, event, giving, rise, to, the, right, to, compensation, starting, from, the, nature, of, the, interest, affected, moreover, there, is, an, astonishing, resemblance, between, the, respective, formulations, 823, paragraph, 1, bgb, is, supposed, to, protect, the, integrity, of, property, and, persons, by, granting, protection, to, life, body, health, freedom, to, property, starck, for, his, part, claims, a, right, to, life, to, bodily, integrity, and, to, the, material, integrity, of, the, objects, belonging, to, us, finally, on, both, sides, it, is, with, the, same, arguments, such, as, the, need, to, protect, the, freedom, to, act, that, a, less, intense, protection, of, purely, economic, and, moral, interests, is, justified, nevertheless, boris, starck, departs, from, the, german, model, by, raising, the, protection, of, physical, integrity, by, a, notch, believing, that, the, only, breach, here, generates, a, right, to, compensation, israeli, tort, law, is, codified, in, the, tort, ordinance, originally, passed, under, british, rule, and, is, largely, based, on, common, law, principles, with, influences, from, civil, law, jurisdictions, the, jewish, law, of, rabbinic, damages, in, israel, is, another, example, of, tort, although, the, tort, ordinance, is, far, more, relevant, in, secular, life, having, been, enacted, by, british, mandate, of, palestine, authorities, in, 1944, and, taking, effect, in, 1947, the, tort, ordinance, additionally, provides, that, any, civil, court, may, grant, either, or, both, compensation, or, an, injunction, as, a, remedy, for, a, tort, and, codifies, common, law, rules, regarding, liability, and, defences, to, tort, claims, chapter, three, of, the, ordinance, provides, a, list, of, torts, recognised, under, israeli, law, including, like, the, french, civil, code, the, japanese, civil, code, only, has, a, single, provision, on, tort, liability, article, 709, of, the, civil, code, states, a, person, who, has, intentionally, or, negligently, infringed, any, right, of, others, or, legally, protected, interest, of, others, shall, be, liable, to, compensate, any, damages, resulting, in, consequence, tort, liability, in, japan, therefore, exists, when, three, conditions, are, met, negligence, or, intentionality, on, the, part, of, the, tortfeasor, infringement, of, some, legally, recognised, right, and, a, causal, link, between, the, tortfeasor, s, action, and, the, infringement, in, question, as, this, leaves, room, for, a, broad, and, potentially, unrestricted, scope, of, tort, liability, japanese, tort, law, gradually, developed, based, on, case, law, including, cases, on, pollution, statutes, outside, the, civil, code, also, regulate, specific, types, of, torts, such, as, the, law, on, the, compensation, of, losses, arising, from, car, accidents, enacted, in, 1955, the, 1973, law, on, the, remedies, of, harm, caused, to, human, health, by, pollution, and, the, 1994, law, on, product, liability, the, standard, of, proof, in, japanese, tort, litigation, is, that, of, proof, of, a, high, degree, of, probability, a, higher, standard, than, the, balance, of, probabilities, utilised, for, tort, liability, in, common, law, jurisdictions, but, lower, than, the, reasonable, doubt, standard, used, in, most, legal, systems, for, criminal, trials, which, the, japanese, supreme, court, described, in, the, leading, case, miura, v, japan, a, case, on, liability, for, medical, malpractice, proving, causation, in, litigation, unlike, proving, causation, in, the, natural, sciences, which, permits, no, doubt, at, any, point, requires, proof, of, a, high, degree, of, probability, that, certain, facts, have, induced, the, occurrence, of, a, specific, result, by, taking, into, necessary, and, sufficient, account, that, the, judge, has, been, persuaded, of, the, truthfulness, to, a, degree, where, an, average, person, would, have, no, doubt, contemporary, japanese, product, liability, law, forms, a, distinct, area, of, tort, liability, in, which, litigation, may, proceed, under, article, 709, of, the, civil, code, or, the, product, liability, act, of, 1994, under, the, product, liability, act, which, defines, products, as, including, any, movable, item, that, is, manufactured, or, processed, manufacturers, bear, strict, liability, where, a, plaintiff, proves, the, existence, of, under, japanese, tort, law, plaintiffs, may, seek, compensation, for, both, economic, and, non, economic, damages, and, there, is, no, statutory, cap, on, damages, however, punitive, damages, are, forbidden, on, public, policy, grounds, japanese, courts, regard, the, compensation, of, plaintiffs, as, the, paramount, purpose, of, damages, under, tort, law, regarding, punishment, and, deterrence, as, the, exclusive, domain, of, criminal, law, punitive, damages, awarded, against, tortfeasors, by, arbitral, tribunals, or, foreign, courts, are, unenforceable, in, japan, additionally, japanese, civil, procedure, does, not, allow, for, class, actions, and, does, not, recognise, mass, tort, liability, as, a, result, of, the, structure, of, japan, s, tort, system, the, country, experiences, a, significantly, lower, litigation, rate, than, other, jurisdictions, in, a, 1990, article, takao, tanase, posited, that, the, structure, of, japan, s, civil, court, system, and, its, tort, jurisprudence, account, for, its, low, litigation, rate, rather, than, any, fundamental, difference, in, culture, between, japan, and, other, countries, indeed, present, literature, finds, that, although, japanese, jurists, take, a, narrow, view, of, tort, law, as, solely, serving, to, compensate, plaintiffs, for, proven, damages, the, general, japanese, public, views, punishment, and, deterrence, as, being, just, as, desirable, in, civil, litigation, as, the, public, in, other, countries, in, japan, in, 1986, fewer, than, 1, of, automobile, accidents, involving, death, or, an, injury, resulted, in, litigation, compared, to, 21, 5, in, the, united, states, a, difference, tanase, argues, can, be, attributed, to, the, availability, of, non, litigious, methods, of, assessing, fault, advising, victims, determining, compensation, and, ensuring, payment, non, litigious, dispute, resolution, mechanisms, mediation, services, consultation, centres, operated, by, governments, the, bar, association, and, insurance, companies, the, japanese, judiciary, also, works, hard, at, developing, clear, detailed, rules, that, guarantee, virtually, automatic, predictable, moderate, compensation, for, most, accident, victims, this, contrasts, with, the, tort, system, in, common, law, jurisdictions, where, the, legal, rules, concerning, both, liability, and, general, damages, i, e, non, economic, loss, are, stated, in, general, terms, leaving, a, great, deal, to, the, judgment, of, constantly, rotating, lay, juries, which, in, turn, makes, courtroom, outcomes, variable, and, difficult, to, predict, the, result, was, a, system, that, is, vastly, more, efficient, and, reliable, in, delivering, compensation, than, in, common, law, jurisdictions, albeit, without, punitive, or, exemplary, damages, tanase, estimated, that, legal, fees, comprised, only, 2, of, the, total, compensation, paid, to, injured, persons, in, the, united, states, in, the, late, 1980s, according, to, two, big, studies, of, motor, vehicle, accident, tort, claims, not, just, lawsuits, payments, to, lawyers, equaled, 47, of, the, total, personal, injury, benefits, paid, by, insurers, this, expense, drives, up, the, cost, of, insurance, to, the, point, that, huge, numbers, of, drivers, are, uninsured, or, under, insured, which, means, that, victims, of, their, negligent, driving, will, get, little, or, nothing, from, the, tort, system, in, 2024, the, new, zealand, supreme, court, gave, leave, for, m, ori, climate, activist, mike, smith, to, sue, seven, corporations, for, their, roles, in, causing, climate, change, and, the, common, law, harms, that, resulted, several, aspects, of, smith, v, fonterra, co, operative, group, limited, are, notable, smith, argued, that, the, principles, of, tikanga, m, ori, a, traditional, system, of, obligations, and, recognitions, of, wrong, can, be, used, to, inform, new, zealand, common, law, smith, argued, that, the, activities, of, the, seven, defendants, by, directly, emitting, greenhouse, gasses, or, supplying, fossil, fuels, fall, under, the, established, torts, of, public, nuisance, and, negligence, and, a, new, tort, of, climate, change, damage, smith, further, argued, that, these, seven, corporations, are, harming, his, tribe, s, land, coastal, waters, and, traditional, culture, smith, belongs, to, the, northland, tribes, of, ng, puhi, and, ng, ti, kahu, this, judgment, simply, allows, smith, to, pursue, these, matters, in, the, high, court, the, defendants, have, indicated, that, they, will, seek, to, convince, the, court, that, climate, change, responses, are, better, left, to, government, policy, and, not, subject, to, civil, litigation, north, korea, s, approach, to, tort, liability, is, relatively, unique, in, the, 21st, century, since, as, a, result, of, its, juche, ideology, and, centralised, planned, economy, its, legal, system, puts, little, emphasis, on, civil, liability, between, private, citizens, instead, it, views, correcting, damages, caused, by, tortious, acts, as, the, prerogative, of, the, state, through, its, economic, intervention, and, criminal, penalties, nevertheless, the, law, on, the, compensation, of, damages, adopted, on, 22, august, 2001, provides, for, tort, liability, including, vicarious, liability, on, the, part, of, principals, for, the, actions, of, agents, employers, for, the, actions, of, employees, parents, or, guardians, for, the, actions, of, children, and, owners, for, the, actions, of, pets, or, other, animals, under, their, control, north, korean, tort, law, also, recognises, capacity, as, an, important, factor, in, determining, whether, or, not, someone, may, be, held, liable, for, their, own, actions, the, philippines, is, a, mixed, law, jurisdiction, shaped, primarily, by, spanish, civil, law, and, american, common, law, as, codified, in, the, philippine, civil, code, for, the, most, part, the, equivalent, of, tort, law, insofar, as, it, concerns, negligence, and, product, liability, in, the, philippines, is, the, law, of, quasi, delict, article, 2176, of, the, civil, code, provides, that, in, the, absence, of, a, contractual, or, quasi, contractual, relationship, a, person, who, by, act, or, omission, causes, damage, to, another, by, way, of, fault, or, negligence, is, obliged, to, pay, for, the, damage, done, article, 1174, which, is, made, applicable, by, article, 2178, provides, that, an, individual, is, generally, exempt, from, liability, if, the, events, giving, rise, to, the, damage, were, unforeseeable, or, inevitable, the, philippine, law, of, quasi, delict, is, largely, a, codification, of, common, law, principles, and, doctrines, for, instance, the, common, law, doctrine, of, comparative, negligence, is, codified, in, article, 2179, providing, for, compensation, to, be, reduced, in, proportion, with, the, plaintiff, s, own, fault, for, the, damage, they, incurred, similarly, the, duty, of, care, established, in, donoghue, v, stevenson, is, codified, by, article, 2187, with, regard, to, manufacturers, and, processors, of, foodstuffs, drinks, toilet, articles, and, similar, goods, and, is, extended, by, article, 2189, to, provincial, and, local, governments, responsible, for, defective, public, amenities, similarly, article, 2190, establishes, liability, for, the, owners, of, defective, buildings, or, structures, that, cause, damage, additionally, case, law, in, the, philippines, recognises, the, common, law, doctrine, of, res, ipsa, loquitur, outside, the, law, of, quasi, delicts, the, civil, code, also, codifies, other, provisions, of, tort, law, in, chapter, 2, of, the, preliminary, title, under, the, heading, human, relations, this, chapter, provides, that, every, person, must, in, the, exercise, of, his, rights, and, in, the, performance, of, his, duties, act, with, justice, give, everyone, his, due, and, observe, honesty, and, good, faith, and, that, every, person, who, contrary, to, law, wilfully, or, negligently, causes, damage, to, another, shall, indemnify, the, latter, for, the, same, while, negligence, and, product, liability, are, primarily, covered, by, the, law, of, quasi, delicts, this, chapter, covers, intentional, wrongs, in, article, 21, which, provides, that, any, person, who, wilfully, causes, loss, or, injury, to, another, in, manner, that, is, contrary, to, morals, good, customs, or, public, policy, shall, compensate, the, latter, for, the, damage, this, chapter, makes, several, other, provisions, in, the, realm, of, tortious, liability, including, liability, for, defamation, article, 33, violations, of, another, person, s, privacy, causing, humiliation, on, account, of, religion, or, economic, status, causing, another, person, to, be, alienated, from, their, friends, article, 26, benefitting, from, without, causing, damage, to, another, person, s, property, article, 23, damages, under, philippine, law, are, provided, for, in, the, philippine, civil, code, which, establishes, harmonised, rules, for, damages, arising, under, any, kind, of, obligation, in, addition, to, pecuniary, or, economic, damages, the, code, provides, for, two, categories, of, non, economic, damages, with, regard, to, quasi, delicts, firstly, moral, damages, i, e, damages, for, physical, suffering, mental, anguish, fright, serious, anxiety, besmirched, reputation, wounded, feelings, moral, shock, social, humiliation, and, similar, injury, resulting, from, a, quasi, delict, may, be, awarded, under, article, 2217, secondly, exemplary, damages, may, be, awarded, under, article, 2231, if, there, was, gross, negligence, on, the, part, of, the, defendant, in, special, cases, a, court, may, choose, to, award, nominal, damages, under, article, 2221, if, it, finds, that, although, it, is, unnecessary, to, compensate, the, plaintiff, it, is, nevertheless, desirable, to, vindicate, or, recognise, the, violation, of, their, right, additionally, where, a, court, cannot, determine, the, value, of, damage, incurred, with, sufficient, certainty, to, award, economic, damages, it, may, instead, award, temperate, or, moderate, damages, under, article, 2224, which, are, higher, than, purely, nominal, damages, but, less, than, compensatory, economic, damages, private, law, in, the, canadian, province, of, qu, bec, derives, from, the, pre, napoleonic, french, law, then, in, force, but, was, eventually, codified, in, the, civil, code, of, lower, canada, and, later, the, present, code, civil, du, qu, bec, ccq, while, tort, law, in, canada, s, other, provinces, follows, common, law, jurisprudence, under, which, distinct, nominate, torts, are, recognised, by, precedent, or, statute, ccq, provides, for, a, general, and, open, ended, concept, of, civil, liability, or, la, responsabilit, civile, in, article, 1457, every, person, has, a, duty, to, abide, by, the, rules, of, conduct, incumbent, on, him, according, to, the, circumstances, usage, or, law, so, as, not, to, cause, injury, to, another, where, he, is, endowed, with, reason, and, fails, in, this, duty, he, is, liable, for, any, injury, he, causes, to, another, by, such, fault, and, is, bound, to, make, reparation, for, the, injury, whether, it, be, bodily, moral, or, material, in, nature, he, is, also, bound, in, certain, cases, to, make, reparation, for, injury, caused, to, another, by, the, act, omission, or, fault, of, another, person, or, by, the, act, of, things, in, his, custody, the, ccq, provides, for, and, defines, the, scope, of, civil, liability, for, damages, caused, by, inanimate, objects, article, 1465, makes, the, general, provision, that, the, custodian, of, a, thing, or, object, bien, is, liable, for, any, damage, caused, by, it, while, article, 1466, provides, that, the, owner, of, an, animal, is, liable, for, damage, or, injury, caused, by, it, even, if, it, had, escaped, from, their, custody, at, the, time, of, the, incident, similarly, article, 1467, imposes, liability, for, damages, caused, by, the, ruin, of, an, immovable, i, e, a, building, or, other, fixed, structure, upon, its, owner, even, if, construction, defects, are, the, ultimate, cause, of, the, ruin, strict, liability, is, imposed, upon, the, manufacturers, of, moveable, things, i, e, product, liability, by, article, 1468, for, injuries, caused, by, safety, defects, an, individual, is, exempt, from, civil, liability, in, cases, of, force, majeure, article, 1470, harm, caused, in, the, process, of, assisting, or, rescuing, another, article, 1471, and, in, certain, other, cases, prescribed, by, law, in, general, there, are, four, conditions, necessary, for, a, finding, of, civil, liability, under, the, ccq, thai, tort, law, as, with, contemporary, thai, law, in, general, is, a, codified, admixture, of, principles, derived, from, common, law, and, civil, law, systems, title, v, of, the, civil, and, commercial, code, of, thailand, cct, establishes, the, principles, of, thai, tort, law, with, section, 420, enshrining, the, basic, doctrine, that, a, person, who, willfully, or, negligently, unlawfully, injures, the, life, body, health, liberty, property, or, any, right, of, another, person, is, said, to, commit, a, wrongful, act, and, is, bound, to, make, compensation, therefore, this, is, analogous, to, article, 709, of, the, japanese, civil, code, which, establishes, three, criteria, for, tort, liability, negligence, or, intentionality, on, the, part, of, the, tortfeasor, infringement, of, some, legally, recognised, right, and, a, causal, link, between, the, tortfeasor, s, action, and, the, infringement, in, question, the, cct, comprehensively, outlines, rules, for, tort, liability, and, the, burden, of, proof, in, general, section, 429, provides, the, default, rule, that, everyone, is, liable, for, their, own, tortious, acts, and, that, the, guardians, of, a, child, or, other, person, lacking, capacity, are, jointly, liable, while, the, burden, of, proof, under, thai, tort, law, is, on, the, plaintiff, by, default, section, 422, of, the, cct, provides, that, an, individual, who, infringes, a, statutory, provision, intended, for, the, protection, of, others, is, presumed, to, be, liable, sections, 425, through, 327, provide, for, vicarious, liability, in, employer, employee, and, principal, agent, relationships, while, providing, that, an, employer, or, principal, found, vicariously, liable, may, seek, compensation, from, the, employee, or, agent, respectively, similarly, section, 433, provides, that, the, owner, or, caretaker, of, an, animal, is, liable, for, any, tortious, conduct, it, may, commit, with, the, caveat, that, the, owner, or, caretaker, may, seek, compensation, for, such, liability, from, anyone, who, wrongfully, excited, or, provoked, the, animal, or, from, the, owner, of, another, animal, which, did, so, sections, 434, to, 436, provide, special, rules, for, liability, for, the, owners, and, possessors, occupiers, e, g, tenants, lessees, of, defective, buildings, and, structures, whereby, 1, the, possessor, is, liable, for, damage, caused, by, defective, construction, or, poor, maintenance, except, if, they, exercised, proper, care, to, prevent, the, damage, 2, if, the, possessor, exercised, proper, care, the, owner, is, liable, 3, the, occupier, of, a, building, is, liable, for, damage, caused, by, items, that, fall, from, the, building, and, 4, an, individual, who, is, at, risk, of, damage, or, injury, from, such, a, building, may, require, its, owner, or, possessor, to, take, preventive, action, certain, provisions, of, the, cct, also, provide, for, strict, liability, with, regard, to, specific, categories, of, tortious, conduct, for, example, section, 437, provides, for, strict, liability, for, an, individual, in, charge, of, a, vehicle, or, conveyance, which, causes, injury, and, for, individuals, possessing, items, which, are, dangerous, by, nature, or, on, account, of, their, mechanical, action, except, where, the, individual, demonstrates, that, the, injury, resulted, from, force, majeure, additionally, the, cct, provides, that, self, defence, the, aversion, of, a, common, danger, the, use, of, reasonable, and, necessary, force, and, where, the, thing, or, person, damaged, was, the, source, of, such, danger, the, aversion, of, an, individual, danger, are, defences, against, tort, claims, the, rules, regarding, compensation, under, thai, tort, law, are, prescribed, by, the, cct, in, general, section, 438, provides, that, courts, may, award, such, compensation, as, appears, necessary, with, regard, to, the, circumstances, and, gravity, of, the, act, and, that, in, addition, to, damages, compensation, may, include, restitution, of, any, property, of, which, the, plaintiff, has, been, deprived, or, which, has, decreased, in, value, as, a, result, of, the, tortious, act, per, section, 439, an, individual, who, defaults, on, an, obligation, to, return, property, they, had, wrongly, deprived, another, individual, of, is, liable, to, compensate, the, other, individual, for, the, accidental, destruction, or, accidental, impossibility, of, returning, the, property, in, question, except, where, such, destruction, or, impossibility, would, have, occurred, regardless, of, the, wrongful, deprivation, section, 440, provides, that, compensation, may, additionally, include, interest, for, lost, time, where, the, tortious, act, contributed, to, an, individual, s, death, compensation, must, include, funerary, expenses, and, where, the, act, resulted, in, damage, to, an, individual, s, health, or, body, compensation, must, include, reimbursement, of, medical, expenses, and, lost, wages, and, may, additionally, include, non, pecuniary, damages, where, the, tortious, act, involves, harm, to, an, individual, s, reputation, the, court, may, order, proper, measures, to, be, taken, to, restore, the, individual, s, reputation, either, together, with, or, in, lieu, of, damages, the, legal, framework, of, the, european, union, consists, of, the, treaties, regulations, directives, and, case, law, specifically, in, the, area, of, tort, law, a, number, of, rules, can, be, found, in, tort, law, directives, examples, of, directives, include, the, product, liability, directive, and, the, directive, on, unfair, commercial, practices, a, directives, can, be, either, a, maximum, harmonisation, directives, which, means, member, states, are, not, allowed, to, deviate, from, it, or, a, minimum, harmonisation, directive, which, only, provide, a, general, framework, article, 288, of, the, tfeu, however, concedes, that, a, directive, shall, be, binding, as, to, the, result, to, be, achieved, upon, each, member, state, to, which, it, is, addressed, but, shall, leave, to, national, authorities, the, choice, of, form, and, methods, liability, can, also, be, based, on, the, violation, of, community, provisions, article, 288, of, the, tfeu, explicitly, regulates, the, liability, of, community, institutions, for, damage, caused, by, the, breach, of, union, law, this, article, does, not, give, precise, liability, rules, but, refers, to, the, general, principles, common, to, the, laws, of, member, states, it, does, not, mean, that, the, community, judicature, must, search, for, a, solution, favoured, by, a, majority, of, member, states, it, simply, means, that, the, community, judicature, must, look, to, the, national, systems, for, inspiration, in, devising, a, regime, of, non, contractual, liability, adapted, to, the, specific, circumstances, of, the, community, the, development, of, a, general, principle, of, liability, for, breach, of, union, law, is, also, in, the, francovich, case, law, of, the, ecj, in, this, 1991, decision, the, ecj, acknowledged, liability, of, the, member, states, towards, individuals, for, violation, of, union, law, as, being, inherent, in, the, system, of, the, treaty, and, being, necessary, for, the, effectiveness, of, community, of, law, on, the, basis, of, the, general, principles, to, which, article, 288, refers, the, ecj, developed, three, requirements, for, liability, the, fulfilment, of, these, requirements, is, sufficient, for, a, right, to, compensation, which, is, directly, based, in, union, law, within, the, european, union, and, neighbouring, countries, the, european, group, on, tort, law, promotes, the, harmonisation, of, tort, law, within, the, region, the, group, meets, regularly, to, discuss, fundamental, issues, of, tort, law, liability, as, well, as, recent, developments, and, the, future, directions, of, the, law, of, tort, the, group, has, founded, the, european, centre, of, tort, and, insurance, law, in, vienna, the, group, has, drafted, a, collection, of, principles, of, european, tort, law, similar, to, the, principles, of, european, contract, law, drafted, by, the, european, contract, law, commission, the, principles, of, european, tort, law, are, a, compilation, of, guidelines, by, the, european, group, on, tort, law, aiming, at, the, harmonisation, of, european, tort, law, they, are, not, intended, to, serve, as, a, model, code, even, though, their, wording, may, resemble, statutory, texts, at, least, with, respect, to, form, and, structure, they, resemble, an, american, restatement, of, the, law, the, principles, of, european, tort, law, are, intended, to, serve, as, a, common, framework, for, the, further, development, of, national, tort, laws, and, also, of, singular, european, legislation, which, could, avoid, a, further, drifting, apart, of, piecemeal, rule, making, both, on, a, national, and, on, the, european, level, in, certain, instances, different, jurisdictions, law, may, apply, to, a, tort, in, which, case, rules, have, developed, for, which, law, to, apply, in, common, law, jurisdictions, the, traditional, approach, to, determine, which, jurisdiction, s, tort, law, is, applicable, is, the, proper, law, test, when, the, jurisdiction, is, in, dispute, one, or, more, state, laws, will, be, relevant, to, the, decision, making, process, if, the, laws, are, the, same, this, will, cause, no, problems, but, if, there, are, substantive, differences, the, choice, of, which, law, to, apply, will, produce, a, different, judgment, each, state, therefore, produces, a, set, of, rules, to, guide, the, choice, of, law, and, one, of, the, most, significant, rules, is, that, the, law, to, be, applied, in, any, given, situation, will, be, the, proper, law, this, is, the, law, which, seems, to, have, the, closest, and, most, real, connection, to, the, facts, of, the, case, and, so, has, the, best, claim, to, be, applied, the, general, rule, is, that, the, proper, law, is, the, primary, system, of, law, that, governs, most, aspects, of, the, factual, situation, giving, rise, to, the, dispute, this, does, not, imply, that, all, the, aspects, of, the, factual, circumstances, are, necessarily, governed, by, the, same, system, of, law, but, there, is, a, strong, presumption, that, this, will, be, the, case, see, characterisation, traditionally, common, law, jurisdictions, such, as, england, required, double, actionability, for, torts, effectively, requiring, the, conduct, to, be, considered, tortious, both, in, england, and, in, the, jurisdiction, whose, law, is, to, apply, under, the, proper, law, rule, over, time, the, proper, law, test, has, been, refined, or, replaced, in, many, common, law, jurisdictions, either, with, reference, to, all, instances, of, conflict, of, laws, or, specifically, in, the, case, of, tort, law, in, english, law, with, the, exception, of, defamation, which, continues, to, apply, the, proper, law, test, s10, private, international, law, miscellaneous, provisions, act, 1995, abolishes, the, double, actionability, test, and, s11, applies, the, lex, loci, delicti, rule, subject, to, an, exception, under, s12, derived, from, boys, v, chaplin, ac, 356, and, red, sea, insurance, co, ltd, v, bouygues, sa, 1, ac, 190, thus, it, is, no, longer, necessary, for, the, case, to, be, based, on, a, tort, actionable, in, england, the, english, courts, must, apply, wider, international, tests, and, respect, any, remedies, available, under, the, applicable, law, or, lex, causae, including, any, rules, on, who, may, claim, e, g, whether, a, personal, representative, may, claim, for, a, fatal, accident, and, who, the, relevant, defendant, may, be, i, e, the, english, court, would, have, to, apply, the, applicable, law, s, rules, on, vicarious, liability, or, the, identity, of, an, occupier, of, land, the, first, step, is, for, the, court, to, decide, where, the, tort, occurred, which, may, be, complicated, if, relevant, events, took, place, in, more, than, one, state, s11, 2, distinguishes, between, in, exceptional, circumstances, the, lex, loci, delicti, rule, is, displaced, in, favour, of, another, law, if, the, factors, relating, to, the, parties, or, any, of, the, events, which, constitute, the, tort, show, that, this, other, law, will, be, substantially, more, appropriate, within, the, european, union, there, have, been, efforts, to, harmonise, conflict, of, tort, laws, rules, between, member, states, under, article, 3, of, the, proposed, rome, ii, regulation, on, the, law, applicable, to, non, contractual, obligations, 22, july, 2003, there, would, be, a, general, presumption, that, the, lex, loci, delicti, will, apply, subject, to, either, an, exception, in, paragraph, 2, for, the, application, of, the, law, to, any, common, habitual, residence, between, the, parties, or, an, exception, in, paragraph, 3, for, cases, in, which, the, non, contractual, obligation, is, manifestly, more, closely, connected, with, another, country, the, so, called, proximity, criterion, in, effect, where, other, specific, rules, of, the, regulation, are, not, applied, these, general, rules, replicate, the, effect, of, the, english, rules, outlined, above, in, product, liability, cases, article, 4, selects, the, law, of, the, injured, party, s, habitual, residence, if, the, product, was, marketed, there, with, the, consent, of, the, defendant, the, rationale, is, that, if, a, defendant, knows, of, and, is, benefiting, from, sales, in, the, plaintiff, s, state, the, choice, of, that, state, s, law, is, reasonable, article, 6, specifies, the, lex, fori, for, actions, arising, out, of, breach, of, privacy, or, defamation, a, rule, that, may, increase, the, risk, of, forum, shopping, whether, the, plaintiff, has, any, right, of, reply, in, a, defamation, case, will, be, determined, under, the, law, of, the, state, where, the, broadcaster, or, publisher, is, established, in, cases, where, contract, and, tort, issues, overlap, article, 9, states, that, the, same, law, should, govern, both, sets, of, issues, thus, applying, contractual, choice, of, law, clauses, to, related, tort, litigation, in, the, united, states, where, each, state, constitutes, a, distinct, jurisdiction, for, the, purposes, of, tort, law, different, jurisdictions, take, different, approaches, to, conflict, of, laws, and, rules, regarding, conflict, of, tort, laws, apply, equally, to, conflicts, between, the, tort, laws, of, two, american, states, and, conflicts, between, an, american, state, and, a, foreign, jurisdiction, until, the, 20th, century, traditional, choice, of, law, rules, were, based, on, the, principle, that, legal, rights, vest, automatically, at, legally, significant, and, ascertainable, times, and, places, for, example, a, dispute, regarding, property, would, be, decided, by, the, law, of, the, place, the, property, was, located, disputes, in, tort, would, be, decided, by, the, place, where, the, injury, occurred, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, traditional, conflict, of, laws, approach, came, under, criticism, from, some, members, of, the, american, legal, community, who, saw, it, as, rigid, and, arbitrary, the, traditional, method, sometimes, forced, the, application, of, the, laws, of, a, state, with, no, connection, to, either, party, except, that, a, tort, or, contract, claim, arose, between, the, parties, in, that, state, this, period, of, intellectual, ferment, which, coincided, with, the, rise, of, the, legal, realism, movement, introduced, a, number, of, innovative, approaches, to, american, choice, of, laws, jurisprudence, scholars, and, lawyers, have, identified, conflicting, aims, for, the, law, of, tort, to, some, extent, reflected, in, the, different, types, of, damages, awarded, by, the, courts, compensatory, aggravated, and, punitive, british, scholar, glanville, williams, notes, four, possible, bases, on, which, different, torts, rested, appeasement, justice, deterrence, and, compensation, william, m, landes, richard, a, posner, and, steven, shavell, have, initiated, a, line, of, research, in, the, law, and, economics, literature, that, is, focused, on, identifying, the, effects, of, tort, law, on, people, s, behavior, these, studies, often, make, use, of, concepts, that, were, developed, in, the, field, of, game, theory, law, and, economic, scholars, characterise, law, in, terms, of, incentives, and, deterrence, and, identified, the, aim, of, tort, as, being, the, efficient, distribution, of, risk, ronald, coase, a, principal, proponent, argued, in, the, problem, of, social, cost, 1960, that, the, aim, of, tort, law, when, transaction, costs, are, high, should, be, to, reflect, as, closely, as, possible, the, allocation, of, risk, and, liability, at, which, private, parties, arrive, when, transaction, costs, are, low, since, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, calls, for, reform, of, tort, law, have, come, from, various, perspectives, some, calls, for, reform, stress, the, difficulties, encountered, by, potential, claimants, for, example, because, not, all, people, who, have, accidents, can, find, solvent, defendants, from, which, to, recover, damages, in, the, courts, p, s, atiyah, has, called, the, situation, a, damages, lottery, consequently, in, new, zealand, the, government, in, the, 1960s, established, a, no, fault, system, of, state, compensation, for, accidents, in, the, 1970s, australia, and, the, united, kingdom, drew, up, proposals, for, similar, no, fault, schemes, but, they, were, later, abandoned, a, wide, variety, of, tort, reforms, have, been, implemented, or, proposed, in, different, jurisdictions, each, attempting, to, address, a, particular, deficiency, perceived, in, the, system, of, tort, law, generally, these, can, be, broken, down, into, two, categories, reforms, limiting, damages, recoverable, by, a, plaintiff, and, procedural, reforms, limiting, the, ability, of, plaintiffs, to, file, lawsuits, a, large, portion, of, tort, reforms, seek, to, limit, the, damages, a, plaintiff, can, be, awarded, the, rationale, underlying, these, reforms, is, that, by, limiting, the, profitability, of, tort, lawsuits, to, plaintiffs, they, will, reduce, the, incentive, to, file, frivolous, lawsuits, there, are, several, varieties, of, reforms, to, the, system, of, damages, in, addition, to, reforms, aimed, at, limiting, plaintiff, s, abilities, to, claim, particular, categories, of, compensation, tort, reform, measures, aimed, at, reducing, the, prevalence, of, lawsuits, for, negligence, the, most, commonly, alleged, tort, aim, to, revise, the, doctrine, of, comparative, negligence, comparative, negligence, is, a, partial, legal, defence, that, reduces, the, amount, of, damages, that, a, plaintiff, can, recover, in, a, negligence, based, claim, based, upon, the, degree, to, which, the, plaintiff, s, own, negligence, contributed, to, cause, the, injury, which, progressively, displaced, the, erstwhile, traditional, doctrine, of, contributory, negligence, over, the, twentieth, century, which, had, precluded, any, damages, being, awarded, in, cases, in, which, the, plaintiff, was, deemed, to, be, even, partially, at, fault, under, standard, or, pure, comparative, negligence, a, plaintiff, can, seek, damages, regardless, of, the, portion, of, liability, they, bear, even, where, they, are, found, to, be, more, at, fault, than, the, respondent, as, a, tort, reform, measure, aimed, at, combatting, the, perceived, unfairness, of, allowing, a, party, to, seek, extra, contractual, damages, where, they, are, primarily, at, fault, many, common, law, jurisdictions, have, adopted, a, modified, doctrine, of, comparative, negligence, in, which, a, party, may, only, recover, damages, if, it, bears, less, than, half, the, liability, or, if, the, other, party, bears, more, than, half, the, liability, more, radically, the, american, states, of, alabama, maryland, north, carolina, and, virginia, continue, to, use, contributory, negligence, thus, precluding, a, party, who, is, even, partly, at, fault, from, recovering, damages, for, negligence, the, abolition, of, the, collateral, source, rule, i, e, the, principle, that, a, respondent, in, a, tort, action, cannot, use, the, fact, that, a, plaintiff, has, already, been, compensated, as, evidence, is, another, common, proposal, of, tort, reform, advocates, in, jurisdictions, where, the, rule, exists, they, argue, that, if, the, plaintiff, s, injuries, and, damages, have, already, been, compensated, it, is, unfair, and, duplicative, to, allow, an, award, of, damages, against, the, respondent, as, a, result, numerous, states, have, altered, or, partially, abrogated, the, rule, by, statute, regulation, of, contingent, fees, as, well, as, rules, regarding, barratry, champerty, and, maintenance, or, litigation, funding, more, generally, is, another, aspect, of, procedural, policies, and, reforms, designed, to, reduce, the, number, of, cases, filed, in, civil, court, in, common, law, jurisdictions, which, typically, rely, on, judicial, precedent, for, the, creation, and, development, of, new, torts, the, creation, of, statutory, torts, is, a, means, through, which, legislatures, reform, and, modify, tort, law, a, statutory, tort, is, like, any, other, in, that, it, imposes, duties, on, private, or, public, parties, however, they, are, created, by, the, legislature, not, the, courts, for, example, the, european, union, s, product, liability, directive, imposes, strict, liability, for, defective, products, that, harm, people, such, strict, liability, is, not, uncommon, although, not, necessarily, statutory, as, another, example, in, england, common, law, liability, of, a, landowner, to, guests, or, trespassers, was, replaced, by, the, occupiers, liability, act, 1957, a, similar, situation, occurred, in, the, u, s, state, of, california, in, which, a, judicial, common, law, rule, established, in, rowland, v, christian, was, amended, through, a, 1985, statute, statutory, torts, also, spread, across, workplace, health, and, safety, laws, and, health, and, safety, in, food, in, some, cases, federal, or, state, statutes, may, preempt, tort, actions, which, is, particularly, discussed, in, terms, of, the, u, s, fda, preemption, although, actions, in, the, united, states, for, medical, devices, are, preempted, due, to, riegel, v, medtronic, inc, 2008, actions, for, medical, drugs, are, not, due, to, wyeth, v, levine, 2009, tort, law, is, closely, related, to, other, areas, of, law, particularly, contract, and, criminal, law, on, one, hand, tort, and, contract, law, are, typically, regarded, as, the, two, primary, fields, within, the, law, of, obligations, with, tort, forming, a, catch, all, category, encompassing, civil, wrongs, that, arise, by, operation, of, law, in, contrast, to, breach, of, contract, which, encompasses, violations, of, obligations, that, are, freely, assumed, by, parties, to, a, contract, on, the, other, hand, both, tort, and, criminal, law, aim, to, address, wrongful, conduct, and, often, overlap, such, that, conduct, which, gives, rise, to, a, claim, under, tort, law, may, also, give, rise, to, a, prosecution, under, criminal, law, tort, is, sometimes, viewed, as, the, causes, of, action, which, are, not, defined, in, other, areas, such, as, contract, or, fiduciary, law, however, tort, and, contract, law, are, similar, in, that, both, involve, a, breach, of, duties, and, in, modern, law, these, duties, have, blurred, and, it, may, not, be, clear, whether, an, action, sounds, in, tort, or, contract, if, both, apply, and, different, standards, apply, for, each, such, as, a, statute, of, limitations, courts, will, determine, which, is, the, gravamen, the, most, applicable, circumstances, such, as, those, involving, professional, negligence, may, involve, both, torts, and, contracts, the, choice, may, affect, time, limits, or, damages, particularly, given, that, damages, are, typically, relatively, limited, in, contract, cases, while, in, tort, cases, noneconomic, damages, such, as, pain, and, suffering, may, be, awarded, punitive, damages, are, relatively, uncommon, in, contractual, cases, versus, tort, cases, however, compensation, for, defective, but, not, unsafe, products, is, typically, available, only, through, contractual, actions, through, the, law, of, warranty, in, the, united, kingdom, plaintiffs, in, professional, negligence, cases, have, some, degree, of, choice, in, which, law, while, in, commercial, transactions, contract, law, applies, in, unusual, cases, intangible, losses, have, been, awarded, in, contract, law, cases, the, english, case, hadley, v, baxendale, 1854, which, was, adopted, in, the, united, states, split, contract, and, tort, damages, by, foreseeability, of, the, damages, when, the, contract, was, made, in, the, united, states, the, pure, economic, loss, rule, was, adopted, to, further, prevent, negligence, lawsuits, in, breach, of, contract, cases, this, economic, loss, rule, was, adopted, by, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, east, river, steamship, corp, v, transamerica, delaval, inc, 1986, and, expanded, across, the, country, in, a, non, uniform, manner, leading, to, confusion, among, other, examples, the, tort, of, insurance, bad, faith, arises, out, of, a, contractual, relationship, and, collateral, torts, such, as, wrongful, dismissal, involving, possible, overlap, with, labour, law, contracts, there, is, some, overlap, between, criminal, law, and, tort, for, example, in, english, law, an, assault, is, both, a, crime, and, a, tort, a, form, of, trespass, to, the, person, a, tort, allows, a, person, to, obtain, a, remedy, that, serves, their, own, purposes, for, example, the, payment, of, damages, or, the, obtaining, of, injunctive, relief, criminal, actions, on, the, other, hand, are, pursued, not, to, obtain, remedies, to, assist, a, person, although, often, criminal, courts, do, have, the, power, to, grant, such, remedies, but, to, remove, their, liberty, on, the, state, s, behalf, this, explains, why, incarceration, is, usually, available, as, a, penalty, for, serious, crimes, but, not, usually, for, torts, in, early, common, law, the, distinction, between, crime, and, tort, was, not, distinct, the, more, severe, penalties, available, in, criminal, law, also, mean, that, it, requires, a, higher, burden, of, proof, to, be, discharged, than, the, related, tort, as, with, other, areas, of, private, law, the, burden, of, proof, required, in, tort, known, either, as, the, balance, of, probabilities, in, english, common, law, or, preponderance, of, evidence, in, american, law, is, lower, than, the, higher, standard, of, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, sometimes, a, claimant, may, prevail, in, a, tort, case, even, if, the, defendant, who, allegedly, caused, harm, were, acquitted, in, an, earlier, criminal, trial, for, example, o, j, simpson, was, acquitted, in, the, criminal, court, of, murder, but, later, found, liable, for, the, tort, of, wrongful, death, both, tort, law, and, criminal, law, may, impose, liability, where, there, is, intentional, action, reckless, behaviour, carelessness, product, liability, without, negligence, in, the, us, and, the, eu, innocence, provided, there, is, strict, liability, battery, assault, and, or, trespass, under, indian, tort, law, and, in, other, jurisdictions, which, adopted, a, version, of, the, 1860, indian, penal, code, the, torts, of, assault, and, battery, are, interpreted, with, reference, to, equivalent, criminal, offences, under, the, indian, penal, code
