historical, linguistics, also, known, as, diachronic, linguistics, is, the, scientific, study, of, how, languages, change, over, time, it, seeks, to, understand, the, nature, and, causes, of, linguistic, change, and, to, trace, the, evolution, of, languages, historical, linguistics, involves, several, key, areas, of, study, including, the, reconstruction, of, ancestral, languages, the, classification, of, languages, into, families, comparative, linguistics, and, the, analysis, of, the, cultural, and, social, influences, on, language, development, this, field, is, grounded, in, the, uniformitarian, principle, which, posits, that, the, processes, of, language, change, observed, today, were, also, at, work, in, the, past, unless, there, is, clear, evidence, to, suggest, otherwise, historical, linguists, aim, to, describe, and, explain, changes, in, individual, languages, explore, the, history, of, speech, communities, and, study, the, origins, and, meanings, of, words, etymology, modern, historical, linguistics, dates, to, the, late, 18th, century, having, originally, grown, out, of, the, earlier, discipline, of, philology, the, study, of, ancient, texts, and, documents, dating, back, to, antiquity, initially, historical, linguistics, served, as, the, cornerstone, of, comparative, linguistics, primarily, as, a, tool, for, linguistic, reconstruction, scholars, were, concerned, chiefly, with, establishing, language, families, and, reconstructing, unrecorded, proto, languages, using, the, comparative, method, and, internal, reconstruction, the, focus, was, initially, on, the, well, known, indo, european, languages, many, of, which, had, long, written, histories, scholars, also, studied, the, uralic, languages, another, eurasian, language, family, for, which, less, early, written, material, exists, since, then, there, has, been, significant, comparative, linguistic, work, expanding, outside, of, european, languages, as, well, such, as, on, the, austronesian, languages, and, on, various, families, of, native, american, languages, among, many, others, comparative, linguistics, became, only, a, part, of, a, more, broadly, conceived, discipline, of, historical, linguistics, for, the, indo, european, languages, comparative, study, is, now, a, highly, specialized, field, some, scholars, have, undertaken, studies, attempting, to, establish, super, families, linking, for, example, indo, european, uralic, and, other, families, into, nostratic, these, attempts, have, not, met, with, wide, acceptance, the, information, necessary, to, establish, relatedness, becomes, less, available, as, the, time, increases, the, time, depth, of, linguistic, methods, is, limited, due, to, chance, word, resemblances, and, variations, between, language, groups, but, a, limit, of, around, 10, 000, years, is, often, assumed, several, methods, are, used, to, date, proto, languages, but, the, process, is, generally, difficult, and, its, results, are, inherently, approximate, in, linguistics, a, synchronic, analysis, is, one, that, views, linguistic, phenomena, only, at, a, given, time, usually, the, present, but, a, synchronic, analysis, of, a, historical, language, form, is, also, possible, it, may, be, distinguished, from, diachronic, which, regards, a, phenomenon, in, terms, of, developments, through, time, diachronic, analysis, is, the, main, concern, of, historical, linguistics, however, most, other, branches, of, linguistics, are, concerned, with, some, form, of, synchronic, analysis, the, study, of, language, change, offers, a, valuable, insight, into, the, state, of, linguistic, representation, and, because, all, synchronic, forms, are, the, result, of, historically, evolving, diachronic, changes, the, ability, to, explain, linguistic, constructions, necessitates, a, focus, on, diachronic, processes, initially, all, of, modern, linguistics, was, historical, in, orientation, even, the, study, of, modern, dialects, involved, looking, at, their, origins, ferdinand, de, saussure, s, distinction, between, synchronic, and, diachronic, linguistics, is, fundamental, to, the, present, day, organization, of, the, discipline, primacy, is, accorded, to, synchronic, linguistics, and, diachronic, linguistics, is, defined, as, the, study, of, successive, synchronic, stages, saussure, s, clear, demarcation, however, has, had, both, defenders, and, critics, in, practice, a, purely, synchronic, linguistics, is, not, possible, for, any, period, before, the, invention, of, the, gramophone, as, written, records, always, lag, behind, speech, in, reflecting, linguistic, developments, written, records, are, difficult, to, date, accurately, before, the, development, of, the, modern, title, page, often, dating, must, rely, on, contextual, historical, evidence, such, as, inscriptions, or, modern, technology, such, as, carbon, dating, can, be, used, to, ascertain, dates, of, varying, accuracy, also, the, work, of, sociolinguists, on, linguistic, variation, has, shown, synchronic, states, are, not, uniform, the, speech, habits, of, older, and, younger, speakers, differ, in, ways, that, point, to, language, change, synchronic, variation, is, linguistic, change, in, progress, synchronic, and, diachronic, approaches, can, reach, quite, different, conclusions, for, example, a, germanic, strong, verb, e, g, english, sing, sang, sung, is, irregular, when, it, is, viewed, synchronically, the, native, speaker, s, brain, processes, them, as, learned, forms, but, the, derived, forms, of, regular, verbs, are, processed, quite, differently, by, the, application, of, productive, rules, for, example, adding, ed, to, the, basic, form, of, a, verb, as, in, walk, walked, that, is, an, insight, of, psycholinguistics, which, is, relevant, also, for, language, didactics, both, of, which, are, synchronic, disciplines, however, a, diachronic, analysis, shows, that, the, strong, verb, is, the, remnant, of, a, fully, regular, system, of, internal, vowel, changes, in, this, case, the, indo, european, ablaut, historical, linguistics, seldom, uses, the, category, irregular, verb, the, principal, tools, of, research, in, diachronic, linguistics, are, the, comparative, method, and, the, method, of, internal, reconstruction, less, standard, techniques, such, as, mass, lexical, comparison, are, used, by, some, linguists, to, overcome, the, limitations, of, the, comparative, method, but, most, linguists, regard, them, as, unreliable, the, findings, of, historical, linguistics, are, often, used, as, a, basis, for, hypotheses, about, the, groupings, and, movements, of, peoples, particularly, in, the, prehistoric, period, in, practice, however, it, is, often, unclear, how, to, integrate, the, linguistic, evidence, with, the, archaeological, or, genetic, evidence, for, example, there, are, numerous, theories, concerning, the, homeland, and, early, movements, of, the, proto, indo, europeans, each, with, its, own, interpretation, of, the, archaeological, record, comparative, linguistics, originally, comparative, philology, is, a, branch, of, historical, linguistics, that, is, concerned, with, comparing, languages, in, order, to, establish, their, historical, relatedness, languages, may, be, related, by, convergence, through, borrowing, or, by, genetic, descent, thus, languages, can, change, and, are, also, able, to, cross, relate, genetic, relatedness, implies, a, common, origin, among, languages, comparative, linguists, construct, language, families, reconstruct, proto, languages, and, analyze, the, historical, changes, that, have, resulted, in, the, documented, languages, divergences, etymology, studies, the, history, of, words, when, they, entered, a, language, from, what, source, and, how, their, form, and, meaning, have, changed, over, time, words, may, enter, a, language, in, several, ways, including, being, borrowed, as, loanwords, from, another, language, being, derived, by, combining, pre, existing, elements, in, the, language, by, a, hybrid, known, as, phono, semantic, matching, in, languages, with, a, long, and, detailed, history, etymology, makes, use, of, philology, the, study, of, how, words, change, from, culture, to, culture, over, time, etymologists, also, apply, the, methods, of, comparative, linguistics, to, reconstruct, information, about, languages, that, are, too, old, for, any, direct, information, such, as, writing, to, be, known, by, analysis, of, related, languages, by, the, comparative, method, linguists, can, make, inferences, about, their, shared, parent, language, and, its, vocabulary, in, that, way, word, roots, that, can, be, traced, all, the, way, back, to, the, origin, of, for, instance, the, indo, european, language, family, have, been, found, although, originating, in, the, philological, tradition, much, current, etymological, research, is, done, in, language, families, for, which, little, or, no, early, documentation, is, available, such, as, uralic, and, austronesian, dialectology, is, the, scientific, study, of, linguistic, dialect, the, varieties, of, a, language, that, are, characteristic, of, particular, groups, based, primarily, on, geographic, distribution, and, their, associated, features, this, is, in, contrast, to, variations, based, on, social, factors, which, are, studied, in, sociolinguistics, or, variations, based, on, time, which, are, studied, in, historical, linguistics, dialectology, treats, such, topics, as, divergence, of, two, local, dialects, from, a, common, ancestor, and, synchronic, variation, dialectologists, are, concerned, with, grammatical, features, that, correspond, to, regional, areas, thus, they, are, usually, dealing, with, populations, living, in, specific, locales, for, generations, without, moving, but, also, with, immigrant, groups, bringing, their, languages, to, new, settlements, immigrant, groups, often, bring, their, linguistic, practices, to, new, settlements, leading, to, distinct, linguistic, varieties, within, those, communities, dialectologists, analyze, these, immigrant, dialects, to, understand, how, languages, develop, and, diversify, in, response, to, migration, and, cultural, interactions, phonology, is, a, sub, field, of, linguistics, which, studies, the, sound, system, of, a, specific, language, or, set, of, languages, whereas, phonetics, is, about, the, physical, production, and, perception, of, the, sounds, of, speech, phonology, describes, the, way, sounds, function, within, a, given, language, or, across, languages, phonology, studies, when, sounds, are, or, are, not, treated, as, distinct, within, a, language, for, example, the, p, in, pin, is, aspirated, but, the, p, in, spin, is, not, in, english, these, two, sounds, are, used, in, complementary, distribution, and, are, not, used, to, differentiate, words, so, they, are, considered, allophones, of, the, same, phoneme, in, some, other, languages, like, thai, and, quechua, the, same, difference, of, aspiration, or, non, aspiration, differentiates, words, and, so, the, two, sounds, or, phones, are, considered, to, be, distinct, phonemes, in, addition, to, the, minimal, meaningful, sounds, the, phonemes, phonology, studies, how, sounds, alternate, such, as, the, p, in, english, and, topics, such, as, syllable, structure, stress, accent, and, intonation, principles, of, phonology, have, also, been, applied, to, the, analysis, of, sign, languages, but, the, phonological, units, do, not, consist, of, sounds, the, principles, of, phonological, analysis, can, be, applied, independently, of, modality, because, they, are, designed, to, serve, as, general, analytical, tools, not, language, specific, ones, morphology, is, the, study, of, patterns, of, word, formation, within, a, language, it, attempts, to, formulate, rules, that, model, the, knowledge, of, speakers, in, the, context, of, historical, linguistics, formal, means, of, expression, change, over, time, words, as, units, in, the, lexicon, are, the, subject, matter, of, lexicology, along, with, clitics, words, are, generally, accepted, to, be, the, smallest, units, of, syntax, however, it, is, clear, in, most, languages, that, words, may, be, related, to, one, another, by, rules, these, rules, are, understood, by, the, speaker, and, reflect, specific, patterns, in, how, word, formation, interacts, with, speech, in, the, context, of, historical, linguistics, the, means, of, expression, change, over, time, syntax, is, the, study, of, the, principles, and, rules, for, constructing, sentences, in, natural, languages, syntax, directly, concerns, the, rules, and, principles, that, govern, sentence, structure, in, individual, languages, researchers, attempt, to, describe, languages, in, terms, of, these, rules, many, historical, linguistics, attempt, to, compare, changes, in, sentence, between, related, languages, or, find, universal, grammar, rules, that, natural, languages, follow, regardless, of, when, and, where, they, are, spoken, in, terms, of, evolutionary, theory, historical, linguistics, as, opposed, to, research, into, the, origin, of, language, studies, lamarckian, acquired, characteristics, of, languages, this, perspective, explores, how, languages, adapt, and, change, over, time, in, response, to, cultural, societal, and, environmental, factors, language, evolution, within, the, framework, of, historical, linguistics, is, akin, to, lamarckism, in, the, sense, that, linguistic, traits, acquired, during, an, individual, s, lifetime, can, potentially, influence, subsequent, generations, of, speakers, historical, linguists, often, use, the, terms, conservative, and, innovative, to, describe, the, extent, of, change, within, a, language, variety, relative, to, that, of, comparable, varieties, conservative, languages, change, less, over, time, when, compared, to, innovative, languages
