co, official, script, in, the, cyrillic, script, s, r, l, k, sih, ril, ik, slavonic, script, or, simply, slavic, script, is, a, writing, system, used, for, various, languages, across, eurasia, it, is, the, designated, national, script, in, various, slavic, turkic, mongolic, uralic, caucasian, and, iranic, speaking, countries, in, southeastern, europe, eastern, europe, the, caucasus, central, asia, north, asia, and, east, asia, and, used, by, many, other, minority, languages, as, of, 2019, around, 250, million, people, in, eurasia, use, cyrillic, as, the, official, script, for, their, national, languages, with, russia, accounting, for, about, half, of, them, with, the, accession, of, bulgaria, to, the, european, union, on, 1, january, 2007, cyrillic, became, the, third, official, script, of, the, european, union, following, the, latin, and, greek, alphabets, the, early, cyrillic, alphabet, was, developed, during, the, 9th, century, ad, at, the, preslav, literary, school, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, during, the, reign, of, tsar, simeon, i, the, great, probably, by, the, disciples, of, the, two, byzantine, brothers, cyril, and, methodius, who, had, previously, created, the, glagolitic, script, among, them, were, clement, of, ohrid, naum, of, preslav, constantine, of, preslav, joan, ekzarh, chernorizets, hrabar, angelar, sava, and, other, scholars, the, script, is, named, in, honor, of, saint, cyril, since, the, script, was, conceived, and, popularised, by, the, followers, of, cyril, and, methodius, in, bulgaria, rather, than, by, cyril, and, methodius, themselves, its, name, denotes, homage, rather, than, authorship, the, cyrillic, script, was, created, during, the, first, bulgarian, empire, modern, scholars, believe, that, the, early, cyrillic, alphabet, was, created, at, the, preslav, literary, school, the, most, important, early, literary, and, cultural, center, of, the, first, bulgarian, empire, and, of, all, slavs, unlike, the, churchmen, in, ohrid, preslav, scholars, were, much, more, dependent, upon, greek, models, and, quickly, abandoned, the, glagolitic, scripts, in, favor, of, an, adaptation, of, the, greek, uncial, to, the, needs, of, slavic, which, is, now, known, as, the, cyrillic, alphabet, a, number, of, prominent, bulgarian, writers, and, scholars, worked, at, the, school, including, naum, of, preslav, until, 893, constantine, of, preslav, joan, ekzarh, also, transcr, john, the, exarch, and, chernorizets, hrabar, among, others, the, school, was, also, a, center, of, translation, mostly, of, byzantine, authors, the, cyrillic, script, is, derived, from, the, greek, uncial, script, letters, augmented, by, ligatures, and, consonants, from, the, older, glagolitic, alphabet, for, sounds, not, found, in, greek, glagolitic, and, cyrillic, were, formalized, by, the, byzantine, saints, cyril, and, methodius, and, their, bulgarian, disciples, such, as, saints, naum, clement, angelar, and, sava, they, spread, and, taught, christianity, in, the, whole, of, bulgaria, paul, cubberley, posits, that, although, cyril, may, have, codified, and, expanded, glagolitic, it, was, his, students, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, under, tsar, simeon, the, great, that, developed, cyrillic, from, the, greek, letters, in, the, 890s, as, a, more, suitable, script, for, church, books, cyrillic, spread, among, other, slavic, peoples, as, well, as, among, non, slavic, romanians, the, earliest, datable, cyrillic, inscriptions, have, been, found, in, the, area, of, preslav, in, the, medieval, city, itself, and, at, nearby, patleina, monastery, both, in, present, day, shumen, province, as, well, as, in, the, ravna, monastery, and, in, the, varna, monastery, the, new, script, became, the, basis, of, alphabets, used, in, various, languages, in, orthodox, church, dominated, eastern, europe, both, slavic, and, non, slavic, languages, such, as, romanian, until, the, 1860s, for, centuries, cyrillic, was, also, used, by, catholic, and, muslim, slavs, see, bosnian, cyrillic, cyrillic, and, glagolitic, were, used, for, the, church, slavonic, language, especially, the, old, church, slavonic, variant, hence, expressions, such, as, is, the, tenth, cyrillic, letter, typically, refer, to, the, order, of, the, church, slavonic, alphabet, not, every, cyrillic, alphabet, uses, every, letter, available, in, the, script, the, cyrillic, script, came, to, dominate, glagolitic, in, the, 12th, century, the, literature, produced, in, old, church, slavonic, soon, spread, north, from, bulgaria, and, became, the, lingua, franca, of, the, balkans, and, eastern, europe, bosnian, cyrillic, widely, known, as, bosan, ica, is, an, extinct, variant, of, the, cyrillic, alphabet, that, originated, in, medieval, bosnia, paleographers, consider, the, earliest, features, of, bosnian, cyrillic, script, had, likely, begun, to, appear, between, the, 10th, or, 11th, century, with, the, humac, tablet, a, tablet, written, in, bosnian, cyrillic, to, be, the, first, such, document, using, this, type, of, script, and, is, believed, to, date, from, this, period, bosnian, cyrillic, was, used, continuously, until, the, 18th, century, with, sporadic, usage, even, taking, place, in, the, 20th, century, with, the, orthographic, reform, of, saint, evtimiy, of, tarnovo, and, other, prominent, representatives, of, the, tarnovo, literary, school, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, such, as, gregory, tsamblak, and, constantine, of, kostenets, the, school, influenced, russian, serbian, wallachian, and, moldavian, medieval, culture, this, is, known, in, russia, as, the, second, south, slavic, influence, in, 1708, 10, the, cyrillic, script, used, in, russia, was, heavily, reformed, by, peter, the, great, who, had, recently, returned, from, his, grand, embassy, in, western, europe, the, new, letterforms, called, the, civil, script, became, closer, to, those, of, the, latin, alphabet, several, archaic, letters, were, abolished, and, several, new, letters, were, introduced, designed, by, peter, himself, letters, became, distinguished, between, upper, and, lower, case, west, european, typography, culture, was, also, adopted, the, pre, reform, letterforms, called, were, notably, retained, in, church, slavonic, and, are, sometimes, used, in, russian, even, today, especially, if, one, wants, to, give, a, text, a, slavic, or, archaic, feel, the, alphabet, used, for, the, modern, church, slavonic, language, in, eastern, orthodox, and, eastern, catholic, rites, still, resembles, early, cyrillic, however, over, the, course, of, the, following, millennium, cyrillic, adapted, to, changes, in, spoken, language, developed, regional, variations, to, suit, the, features, of, national, languages, and, was, subjected, to, academic, reform, and, political, decrees, a, notable, example, of, such, linguistic, reform, can, be, attributed, to, vuk, stefanovi, karad, i, who, updated, the, serbian, cyrillic, alphabet, by, removing, certain, graphemes, no, longer, represented, in, the, vernacular, and, introducing, graphemes, specific, to, serbian, i, e, distancing, it, from, the, church, slavonic, alphabet, in, use, prior, to, the, reform, today, many, languages, in, the, balkans, eastern, europe, and, northern, eurasia, are, written, in, cyrillic, alphabets, cyrillic, script, spread, throughout, the, east, slavic, and, some, south, slavic, territories, being, adopted, for, writing, local, languages, such, as, old, east, slavic, its, adaptation, to, local, languages, produced, a, number, of, cyrillic, alphabets, discussed, below, capital, and, lowercase, letters, were, not, distinguished, in, old, manuscripts, yeri, was, originally, a, ligature, of, yer, and, i, iotation, was, indicated, by, ligatures, formed, with, the, letter, not, an, ancestor, of, modern, ya, which, is, derived, from, ligature, of, and, sometimes, different, letters, were, used, interchangeably, for, example, as, were, typographical, variants, like, there, were, also, commonly, used, ligatures, like, the, letters, also, had, numeric, values, based, not, on, cyrillic, alphabetical, order, but, inherited, from, the, letters, greek, ancestors, computer, fonts, for, early, cyrillic, alphabets, are, not, routinely, provided, many, of, the, letterforms, differ, from, those, of, modern, cyrillic, varied, a, great, deal, between, manuscripts, and, changed, over, time, in, accordance, with, unicode, policy, the, standard, does, not, include, letterform, variations, or, ligatures, found, in, manuscript, sources, unless, they, can, be, shown, to, conform, to, the, unicode, definition, of, a, character, this, aspect, is, the, responsibility, of, the, typeface, designer, the, unicode, 5, 1, standard, released, on, 4, april, 2008, greatly, improved, computer, support, for, the, early, cyrillic, and, the, modern, church, slavonic, language, in, microsoft, windows, the, segoe, ui, user, interface, font, is, notable, for, having, complete, support, for, the, archaic, cyrillic, letters, since, windows, 8, some, currency, signs, have, derived, from, cyrillic, letters, the, development, of, cyrillic, letter, forms, passed, directly, from, the, medieval, stage, to, the, late, baroque, without, a, renaissance, phase, as, in, western, europe, late, medieval, cyrillic, letters, categorized, as, vyaz, and, still, found, on, many, icon, inscriptions, today, show, a, marked, tendency, to, be, very, tall, and, narrow, with, strokes, often, shared, between, adjacent, letters, peter, the, great, tsar, of, russia, mandated, the, use, of, westernized, letter, forms, ru, in, the, early, 18th, century, over, time, these, were, largely, adopted, in, the, other, languages, that, use, the, script, thus, unlike, the, majority, of, modern, greek, typefaces, that, retained, their, own, set, of, design, principles, for, lower, case, letters, such, as, the, placement, of, serifs, the, shapes, of, stroke, ends, and, stroke, thickness, rules, although, greek, capital, letters, do, use, latin, design, principles, modern, cyrillic, types, are, much, the, same, as, modern, latin, types, of, the, same, typeface, family, the, development, of, some, cyrillic, computer, fonts, from, latin, ones, has, also, contributed, to, a, visual, latinization, of, cyrillic, type, cyrillic, uppercase, and, lowercase, letter, forms, are, not, as, differentiated, as, in, latin, typography, upright, cyrillic, lowercase, letters, are, essentially, small, capitals, with, exceptions, cyrillic, and, adopted, latin, lowercase, shapes, lowercase, is, typically, based, on, p, from, latin, typefaces, lowercase, and, are, traditional, handwritten, forms, although, a, good, quality, cyrillic, typeface, will, still, include, separate, small, caps, glyphs, cyrillic, typefaces, as, well, as, latin, ones, have, roman, and, italic, forms, practically, all, popular, modern, computer, fonts, include, parallel, sets, of, latin, and, cyrillic, letters, where, many, glyphs, uppercase, as, well, as, lowercase, are, shared, by, both, however, the, native, typeface, terminology, in, most, slavic, languages, for, example, in, russian, does, not, use, the, words, roman, and, italic, in, this, sense, instead, the, nomenclature, follows, german, naming, patterns, similarly, to, latin, typefaces, italic, and, cursive, forms, of, many, cyrillic, letters, typically, lowercase, uppercase, only, for, handwritten, or, stylish, types, are, very, different, from, their, upright, roman, types, in, certain, cases, the, correspondence, between, uppercase, and, lowercase, glyphs, does, not, coincide, in, latin, and, cyrillic, types, for, example, italic, cyrillic, is, the, lowercase, counterpart, of, not, of, note, in, some, typefaces, or, styles, i, e, the, lowercase, italic, cyrillic, may, look, like, latin, g, and, i, e, lowercase, italic, cyrillic, may, look, like, small, capital, italic, t, in, standard, serbian, as, well, as, in, macedonian, some, italic, and, cursive, letters, are, allowed, to, be, different, to, more, closely, resemble, the, handwritten, letters, the, regular, upright, shapes, are, generally, standardized, in, small, caps, form, notes, depending, on, fonts, available, the, serbian, row, may, appear, identical, to, the, russian, row, unicode, approximations, are, used, in, the, faux, row, to, ensure, it, can, be, rendered, properly, across, all, systems, in, the, bulgarian, alphabet, many, lowercase, letterforms, may, more, closely, resemble, the, cursive, forms, on, the, one, hand, and, latin, glyphs, on, the, other, hand, e, g, by, having, an, ascender, or, descender, or, by, using, rounded, arcs, instead, of, sharp, corners, sometimes, uppercase, letters, may, have, a, different, shape, as, well, e, g, more, triangular, and, like, greek, delta, and, lambda, notes, depending, on, fonts, available, the, bulgarian, row, may, appear, identical, to, the, russian, row, unicode, approximations, are, used, in, the, faux, row, to, ensure, it, can, be, rendered, properly, across, all, systems, in, some, cases, such, as, with, k, like, ascender, no, such, approximation, exists, computer, fonts, typically, default, to, the, central, eastern, russian, letterforms, and, require, the, use, of, opentype, layout, otl, features, to, display, the, western, bulgarian, or, southern, serbian, macedonian, forms, depending, on, the, choices, made, by, the, computer, font, designer, they, may, either, be, automatically, activated, by, the, local, variant, locl, feature, for, text, tagged, with, an, appropriate, language, code, or, the, author, needs, to, opt, in, by, activating, a, stylistic, set, ss, or, character, variant, cv, feature, these, solutions, only, enjoy, partial, support, and, may, render, with, default, glyphs, in, certain, software, configurations, and, the, reader, may, not, see, the, same, result, as, the, author, intended, among, others, cyrillic, is, the, standard, script, for, writing, the, following, languages, slavic, languages, non, slavic, languages, of, russia, non, slavic, languages, in, other, countries, the, cyrillic, script, has, also, been, used, for, languages, of, alaska, slavic, europe, except, for, western, slavic, and, some, southern, slavic, the, caucasus, the, languages, of, idel, ural, siberia, and, the, russian, far, east, the, first, alphabet, derived, from, cyrillic, was, abur, used, for, the, komi, language, other, cyrillic, alphabets, include, the, molodtsov, alphabet, for, the, komi, language, and, various, alphabets, for, caucasian, languages, a, number, of, languages, written, in, a, cyrillic, alphabet, have, also, been, written, in, a, latin, alphabet, such, as, azerbaijani, uzbek, serbian, and, romanian, in, the, republic, of, moldova, until, 1989, and, in, the, danubian, principalities, throughout, the, 19th, century, after, the, disintegration, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, some, of, the, former, republics, officially, shifted, from, cyrillic, to, latin, the, transition, is, complete, in, most, of, moldova, except, the, breakaway, region, of, transnistria, where, moldovan, cyrillic, is, official, turkmenistan, and, azerbaijan, uzbekistan, still, uses, both, systems, and, kazakhstan, has, officially, begun, a, transition, from, cyrillic, to, latin, scheduled, to, be, complete, by, 2025, the, russian, government, has, mandated, that, cyrillic, must, be, used, for, all, public, communications, in, all, federal, subjects, of, russia, to, promote, closer, ties, across, the, federation, this, act, was, controversial, for, speakers, of, many, slavic, languages, for, others, such, as, chechen, and, ingush, speakers, the, law, had, political, ramifications, for, example, the, separatist, chechen, government, mandated, a, latin, script, which, is, still, used, by, many, chechens, standard, serbian, uses, both, the, cyrillic, and, latin, scripts, cyrillic, is, nominally, the, official, script, of, serbia, s, administration, according, to, the, serbian, constitution, however, the, law, does, not, regulate, scripts, in, standard, language, or, standard, language, itself, by, any, means, in, practice, the, scripts, are, equal, with, latin, being, used, more, often, in, a, less, official, capacity, the, zhuang, alphabet, used, between, the, 1950s, and, 1980s, in, portions, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, used, a, mixture, of, latin, phonetic, numeral, based, and, cyrillic, letters, the, non, latin, letters, including, cyrillic, were, removed, from, the, alphabet, in, 1982, and, replaced, with, latin, letters, that, closely, resembled, the, letters, they, replaced, there, are, various, systems, for, romanization, of, cyrillic, text, including, transliteration, to, convey, cyrillic, spelling, in, latin, letters, and, transcription, to, convey, pronunciation, standard, cyrillic, to, latin, transliteration, systems, include, see, also, romanization, of, belarusian, bulgarian, kyrgyz, russian, macedonian, and, ukrainian, representing, other, writing, systems, with, cyrillic, letters, is, called, cyrillization, as, of, unicode, version, 15, 1, cyrillic, letters, including, national, and, historical, alphabets, are, encoded, across, several, blocks, the, characters, in, the, range, u, 0400, to, u, 045f, are, essentially, the, characters, from, iso, 8859, 5, moved, upward, by, 864, positions, the, characters, in, the, range, u, 0460, to, u, 0489, are, historic, letters, not, used, now, the, characters, in, the, range, u, 048a, to, u, 052f, are, additional, letters, for, various, languages, that, are, written, with, cyrillic, script, unicode, as, a, general, rule, does, not, include, accented, cyrillic, letters, a, few, exceptions, include, to, indicate, stressed, or, long, vowels, combining, diacritical, marks, can, be, used, after, the, respective, letter, for, example, u, 0301, combining, acute, accent, etc, some, languages, including, church, slavonic, are, still, not, fully, supported, unicode, 5, 1, released, on, 4, april, 2008, introduces, major, changes, to, the, cyrillic, blocks, revisions, to, the, existing, cyrillic, blocks, and, the, addition, of, cyrillic, extended, a, 2de0, 2dff, and, cyrillic, extended, b, a640, a69f, significantly, improve, support, for, the, early, cyrillic, alphabet, abkhaz, aleut, chuvash, kurdish, and, moksha, other, character, encoding, systems, for, cyrillic, each, language, has, its, own, standard, keyboard, layout, adopted, from, traditional, national, typewriters, with, the, flexibility, of, computer, input, methods, there, are, also, transliterating, or, phonetic, homophonic, keyboard, layouts, made, for, typists, who, are, more, familiar, with, other, layouts, like, the, common, english, qwerty, keyboard, when, practical, cyrillic, keyboard, layouts, are, unavailable, computer, users, sometimes, use, transliteration, translit, or, look, alike, volapuk, encoding, to, type, in, languages, that, are, normally, written, with, the, cyrillic, alphabet, potentially, these, proxy, versions, could, be, transformed, programmatically, into, cyrillic, at, a, later, date
