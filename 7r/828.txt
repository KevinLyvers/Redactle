sustainable, development, is, an, approach, to, growth, and, human, development, that, aims, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, present, without, compromising, the, ability, of, future, generations, to, meet, their, own, needs, the, aim, is, to, have, a, society, where, living, conditions, and, resources, meet, human, needs, without, undermining, planetary, integrity, sustainable, development, aims, to, balance, the, needs, of, the, economy, environment, and, social, well, being, the, brundtland, report, in, 1987, helped, to, make, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, better, known, sustainable, development, overlaps, with, the, idea, of, sustainability, which, is, a, normative, concept, unesco, formulated, a, distinction, between, the, two, concepts, as, follows, sustainability, is, often, thought, of, as, a, long, term, goal, i, e, a, more, sustainable, world, while, sustainable, development, refers, to, the, many, processes, and, pathways, to, achieve, it, there, are, some, problems, with, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, some, scholars, say, it, is, an, oxymoron, because, according, to, them, development, is, inherently, unsustainable, other, commentators, are, disappointed, in, the, lack, of, progress, that, has, been, achieved, so, far, part, of, the, problem, is, that, development, itself, is, not, consistently, defined, 16, the, rio, process, that, began, at, the, 1992, earth, summit, in, rio, de, janeiro, has, placed, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, on, the, international, agenda, in, 2015, the, united, nations, general, assembly, unga, adopted, the, sustainable, development, goals, for, the, year, 2030, these, development, goals, address, the, global, challenges, including, for, example, poverty, climate, change, biodiversity, loss, and, peace, in, 1987, the, united, nations, world, commission, on, environment, and, development, released, the, report, our, common, future, commonly, called, the, brundtland, report, the, report, included, a, definition, of, sustainable, development, which, is, now, widely, used, sustainable, development, is, a, development, that, meets, the, needs, of, the, present, without, compromising, the, ability, of, future, generations, to, meet, their, own, needs, it, contains, two, key, concepts, within, it, sustainable, development, thus, tries, to, find, a, balance, between, economic, development, environmental, protection, and, social, well, being, sustainable, development, has, its, roots, in, ideas, regarding, sustainable, forest, management, which, were, developed, in, europe, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, response, to, a, growing, awareness, of, the, depletion, of, timber, resources, in, england, john, evelyn, argued, in, his, 1662, essay, sylva, that, sowing, and, planting, of, trees, had, to, be, regarded, as, a, national, duty, of, every, landowner, in, order, to, stop, the, destructive, over, exploitation, of, natural, resources, in, 1713, hans, carl, von, carlowitz, a, senior, mining, administrator, in, the, service, of, elector, frederick, augustus, i, of, saxony, published, sylvicultura, economics, a, 400, page, work, on, forestry, building, upon, the, ideas, of, evelyn, and, french, minister, jean, baptiste, colbert, von, carlowitz, developed, the, concept, of, managing, forests, for, sustained, yield, his, work, influenced, others, including, alexander, von, humboldt, and, georg, ludwig, hartig, eventually, leading, to, the, development, of, the, science, of, forestry, this, in, turn, influenced, people, like, gifford, pinchot, the, first, head, of, the, us, forest, service, whose, approach, to, forest, management, was, driven, by, the, idea, of, wise, use, of, resources, and, aldo, leopold, whose, land, ethic, was, influential, in, the, development, of, the, environmental, movement, in, the, 1960s, following, the, publication, of, rachel, carson, s, silent, spring, in, 1962, the, developing, environmental, movement, drew, attention, to, the, relationship, between, economic, growth, and, environmental, degradation, kenneth, e, boulding, in, his, influential, 1966, essay, the, economics, of, the, coming, spaceship, earth, identified, the, need, for, the, economic, system, to, fit, itself, to, the, ecological, system, with, its, limited, pools, of, resources, another, milestone, was, the, 1968, article, by, garrett, hardin, that, popularized, the, term, tragedy, of, the, commons, the, direct, linking, of, sustainability, and, development, in, a, contemporary, sense, can, be, traced, to, the, early, 1970s, strategy, of, progress, a, 1972, book, in, german, by, ernst, basler, explained, how, the, long, acknowledged, sustainability, concept, of, preserving, forests, for, future, wood, production, can, be, directly, transferred, to, the, broader, importance, of, preserving, environmental, resources, to, sustain, the, world, for, future, generations, that, same, year, the, interrelationship, of, environment, and, development, was, formally, demonstrated, in, a, systems, dynamic, simulation, model, reported, in, the, classic, report, on, limits, to, growth, this, was, commissioned, by, the, club, of, rome, and, written, by, a, group, of, scientists, led, by, dennis, and, donella, meadows, of, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, describing, the, desirable, state, of, global, equilibrium, the, authors, wrote, we, are, searching, for, a, model, output, that, represents, a, world, system, that, is, sustainable, without, sudden, and, uncontrolled, collapse, and, capable, of, satisfying, the, basic, material, requirements, of, all, of, its, people, the, year, 1972, also, saw, the, publication, of, the, influential, book, a, blueprint, for, survival, in, 1975, an, mit, research, group, prepared, ten, days, of, hearings, on, growth, and, its, implication, for, the, future, for, the, us, congress, the, first, hearings, ever, held, on, sustainable, development, in, 1980, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, published, a, world, conservation, strategy, that, included, one, of, the, first, references, to, sustainable, development, as, a, global, priority, and, introduced, the, term, sustainable, development, 4, two, years, later, the, united, nations, world, charter, for, nature, raised, five, principles, of, conservation, by, which, human, conduct, affecting, nature, is, to, be, guided, and, judged, since, the, brundtland, report, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, has, developed, beyond, the, initial, intergenerational, framework, to, focus, more, on, the, goal, of, socially, inclusive, and, environmentally, sustainable, economic, growth, 5, in, 1992, the, un, conference, on, environment, and, development, published, the, earth, charter, which, outlines, the, building, of, a, just, sustainable, and, peaceful, global, society, in, the, 21st, century, the, action, plan, agenda, 21, for, sustainable, development, identified, information, integration, and, participation, as, key, building, blocks, to, help, countries, achieve, development, that, recognizes, these, interdependent, pillars, furthermore, agenda, 21, emphasizes, that, broad, public, participation, in, decision, making, is, a, fundamental, prerequisite, for, achieving, sustainable, development, the, rio, protocol, was, a, huge, leap, forward, for, the, first, time, the, world, agreed, on, a, sustainability, agenda, in, fact, a, global, consensus, was, facilitated, by, neglecting, concrete, goals, and, operational, details, the, sustainable, development, goals, sdgs, now, have, concrete, targets, unlike, the, results, from, the, rio, process, but, no, methods, for, sanctions, 137, sustainable, development, like, sustainability, is, regarded, to, have, three, dimensions, the, environment, economy, and, society, the, idea, is, that, a, good, balance, between, the, three, dimensions, should, be, achieved, instead, of, calling, them, dimensions, other, terms, commonly, used, are, pillars, domains, aspects, spheres, scholars, usually, distinguish, three, different, areas, of, sustainability, these, are, the, environmental, the, social, and, the, economic, several, terms, are, in, use, for, this, concept, authors, may, speak, of, three, pillars, dimensions, components, aspects, perspectives, factors, or, goals, all, mean, the, same, thing, in, this, context, the, three, dimensions, paradigm, has, few, theoretical, foundations, countries, could, develop, systems, for, monitoring, and, evaluation, of, progress, towards, achieving, sustainable, development, by, adopting, indicators, that, measure, changes, across, economic, social, and, environmental, dimensions, six, interdependent, capacities, are, deemed, to, be, necessary, for, the, successful, pursuit, of, sustainable, development, these, are, the, capacities, to, measure, progress, towards, sustainable, development, promote, equity, within, and, between, generations, adapt, to, shocks, and, surprises, transform, the, system, onto, more, sustainable, development, pathways, link, knowledge, with, action, for, sustainability, and, to, devise, governance, arrangements, that, allow, people, to, work, together, environmental, sustainability, concerns, the, natural, environment, and, how, it, endures, and, remains, diverse, and, productive, since, natural, resources, are, derived, from, the, environment, the, state, of, air, water, and, climate, is, of, particular, concern, environmental, sustainability, requires, society, to, design, activities, to, meet, human, needs, while, preserving, the, life, support, systems, of, the, planet, this, for, example, entails, using, water, sustainably, using, renewable, energy, and, sustainable, material, supplies, e, g, harvesting, wood, from, forests, at, a, rate, that, maintains, the, biomass, and, biodiversity, an, unsustainable, situation, occurs, when, natural, capital, the, total, of, nature, s, resources, is, used, up, faster, than, it, can, be, replenished, 58, sustainability, requires, that, human, activity, only, uses, nature, s, resources, at, a, rate, at, which, they, can, be, replenished, naturally, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, is, intertwined, with, the, concept, of, carrying, capacity, theoretically, the, long, term, result, of, environmental, degradation, is, the, inability, to, sustain, human, life, important, operational, principles, of, sustainable, development, were, published, by, herman, daly, in, 1990, renewable, resources, should, provide, a, sustainable, yield, the, rate, of, harvest, should, not, exceed, the, rate, of, regeneration, for, non, renewable, resources, there, should, be, equivalent, development, of, renewable, substitutes, waste, generation, should, not, exceed, the, assimilative, capacity, of, the, environment, environmental, problems, associated, with, industrial, agriculture, and, agribusiness, are, now, being, addressed, through, approaches, such, as, sustainable, agriculture, organic, farming, and, more, sustainable, business, practices, the, most, cost, effective, climate, change, mitigation, options, include, afforestation, sustainable, forest, management, and, reducing, deforestation, at, the, local, level, there, are, various, movements, working, towards, sustainable, food, systems, which, may, include, less, meat, consumption, local, food, production, slow, food, sustainable, gardening, and, organic, gardening, the, environmental, effects, of, different, dietary, patterns, depend, on, many, factors, including, the, proportion, of, animal, and, plant, foods, consumed, and, the, method, of, food, production, as, global, population, and, affluence, have, increased, so, has, the, use, of, various, materials, increased, in, volume, diversity, and, distance, transported, included, here, are, raw, materials, minerals, synthetic, chemicals, including, hazardous, substances, manufactured, products, food, living, organisms, and, waste, by, 2050, humanity, could, consume, an, estimated, 140, billion, tons, of, minerals, ores, fossil, fuels, and, biomass, per, year, three, times, its, current, amount, unless, the, economic, growth, rate, is, decoupled, from, the, rate, of, natural, resource, consumption, developed, countries, citizens, consume, an, average, of, 16, tons, of, those, four, key, resources, per, capita, per, year, ranging, up, to, 40, or, more, tons, per, person, in, some, developed, countries, with, resource, consumption, levels, far, beyond, what, is, likely, sustainable, by, comparison, the, average, person, in, india, today, consumes, four, tons, per, year, sustainable, use, of, materials, has, targeted, the, idea, of, dematerialization, converting, the, linear, path, of, materials, extraction, use, disposal, in, landfill, to, a, circular, material, flow, that, reuses, materials, as, much, as, possible, much, like, the, cycling, and, reuse, of, waste, in, nature, dematerialization, is, being, encouraged, through, the, ideas, of, industrial, ecology, eco, design, and, ecolabelling, this, way, of, thinking, is, expressed, in, the, concept, of, circular, economy, which, employs, reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and, recycling, to, create, a, closed, loop, system, minimizing, the, use, of, resource, inputs, and, the, creation, of, waste, pollution, and, carbon, emissions, building, electric, vehicles, has, been, one, of, the, most, popular, ways, in, the, field, of, sustainable, development, the, potential, of, using, reusable, energy, and, reducing, waste, offered, a, perspective, in, sustainable, development, the, european, commission, has, adopted, an, ambitious, circular, economy, action, plan, in, 2020, which, aims, at, making, sustainable, products, the, norm, in, the, eu, there, is, a, connection, between, ecosystems, and, biodiversity, ecosystems, are, made, up, of, various, living, things, interacting, with, one, another, and, their, surroundings, along, with, this, biodiversity, lays, the, groundwork, for, ecosystems, to, function, well, by, defining, the, kinds, of, species, that, can, coexist, in, an, environment, as, well, as, their, functions, and, interactions, with, other, species, in, 2019, a, summary, for, policymakers, of, the, largest, most, comprehensive, study, to, date, of, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, was, published, by, the, intergovernmental, science, policy, platform, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, it, recommended, that, human, civilization, will, need, a, transformative, change, including, sustainable, agriculture, reductions, in, consumption, and, waste, fishing, quotas, and, collaborative, water, management, biodiversity, is, not, only, crucial, for, the, well, being, of, animals, and, wildlife, but, also, plays, a, positive, role, in, the, lives, of, human, beings, in, the, way, in, which, it, aids, development, of, human, life, the, environmental, impact, of, a, community, or, humankind, as, a, whole, depends, both, on, population, and, impact, per, person, which, in, turn, depends, in, complex, ways, on, what, resources, are, being, used, whether, or, not, those, resources, are, renewable, and, the, scale, of, the, human, activity, relative, to, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, ecosystems, involved, careful, resource, management, can, be, applied, at, many, scales, from, economic, sectors, like, agriculture, manufacturing, and, industry, to, work, organizations, the, consumption, patterns, of, households, and, individuals, and, the, resource, demands, of, individual, goods, and, services, the, underlying, driver, of, direct, human, impacts, on, the, environment, is, human, consumption, this, impact, is, reduced, by, not, only, consuming, less, but, also, making, the, full, cycle, of, production, use, and, disposal, more, sustainable, consumption, of, goods, and, services, can, be, analyzed, and, managed, at, all, scales, through, the, chain, of, consumption, starting, with, the, effects, of, individual, lifestyle, choices, and, spending, patterns, through, to, the, resource, demands, of, specific, goods, and, services, the, impacts, of, economic, sectors, through, national, economies, to, the, global, economy, key, resource, categories, relating, to, human, needs, are, food, energy, raw, materials, and, water, it, has, been, suggested, that, because, of, the, rural, poverty, and, overexploitation, environmental, resources, should, be, treated, as, important, economic, assets, called, natural, capital, economic, development, has, traditionally, required, a, growth, in, the, gross, domestic, product, this, model, of, unlimited, personal, and, gdp, growth, may, be, over, sustainable, development, may, involve, improvements, in, the, quality, of, life, for, many, but, may, necessitate, a, decrease, in, resource, consumption, growth, generally, ignores, the, direct, effect, that, the, environment, may, have, on, social, welfare, whereas, development, takes, it, into, account, as, early, as, the, 1970s, the, concept, of, sustainability, was, used, to, describe, an, economy, in, equilibrium, with, basic, ecological, support, systems, scientists, in, many, fields, have, highlighted, the, limits, to, growth, and, economists, have, presented, alternatives, for, example, a, steady, state, economy, to, address, concerns, over, the, impacts, of, expanding, human, development, on, the, planet, in, 1987, the, economist, edward, barbier, published, the, study, the, concept, of, sustainable, economic, development, where, he, recognized, that, goals, of, environmental, conservation, and, economic, development, are, not, conflicting, and, can, be, reinforcing, each, other, a, world, bank, study, from, 1999, concluded, that, based, on, the, theory, of, genuine, savings, defined, as, traditional, net, savings, less, the, value, of, resource, depletion, and, environmental, degradation, plus, the, value, of, investment, in, human, capital, policymakers, have, many, possible, interventions, to, increase, sustainability, in, macroeconomics, or, purely, environmental, several, studies, have, noted, that, efficient, policies, for, renewable, energy, and, pollution, are, compatible, with, increasing, human, welfare, eventually, reaching, a, golden, rule, steady, state, a, meta, review, in, 2002, looked, at, environmental, and, economic, valuations, and, found, a, lack, of, concrete, understanding, of, what, sustainability, policies, might, entail, in, practice, a, study, concluded, in, 2007, that, knowledge, manufactured, and, human, capital, health, and, education, has, not, compensated, for, the, degradation, of, natural, capital, in, many, parts, of, the, world, it, has, been, suggested, that, intergenerational, equity, can, be, incorporated, into, a, sustainable, development, and, decision, making, as, has, become, common, in, economic, valuations, of, climate, economics, the, world, business, council, for, sustainable, development, published, a, vision, 2050, document, in, 2021, to, show, how, business, can, lead, the, transformations, the, world, needs, the, vision, states, that, we, envision, a, world, in, which, 9, billion, people, can, live, well, within, planetary, boundaries, by, 2050, this, report, was, highlighted, by, the, guardian, as, the, largest, concerted, corporate, sustainability, action, plan, to, date, include, reversing, the, damage, done, to, ecosystems, addressing, rising, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, ensuring, societies, move, to, sustainable, agriculture, there, are, many, reasons, why, sustainability, is, so, difficult, to, achieve, these, reasons, have, the, name, sustainability, barriers, before, addressing, these, barriers, it, is, important, to, analyze, and, understand, them, 34, some, barriers, arise, from, nature, and, its, complexity, everything, is, related, others, arise, from, the, human, condition, one, example, is, the, value, action, gap, this, reflects, the, fact, that, people, often, do, not, act, according, to, their, convictions, experts, describe, these, barriers, as, intrinsic, to, the, concept, of, sustainability, 81, other, barriers, are, extrinsic, to, the, concept, of, sustainability, this, means, it, is, possible, to, overcome, them, one, way, would, be, to, put, a, price, tag, on, the, consumption, of, public, goods, 84, some, extrinsic, barriers, relate, to, the, nature, of, dominant, institutional, frameworks, examples, would, be, where, market, mechanisms, fail, for, public, goods, existing, societies, economies, and, cultures, encourage, increased, consumption, there, is, a, structural, imperative, for, growth, in, competitive, market, economies, this, inhibits, necessary, societal, change, furthermore, there, are, several, barriers, related, to, the, difficulties, of, implementing, sustainability, policies, there, are, trade, offs, between, the, goals, of, environmental, policies, and, economic, development, environmental, goals, include, nature, conservation, development, may, focus, on, poverty, reduction, 65, there, are, also, trade, offs, between, short, term, profit, and, long, term, viability, 65, political, pressures, generally, favor, the, short, term, over, the, long, term, so, they, form, a, barrier, to, actions, oriented, toward, improving, sustainability, 86, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, has, been, and, still, is, subject, to, criticism, including, the, question, of, what, is, to, be, sustained, in, sustainable, development, it, has, been, argued, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, sustainable, use, of, a, non, renewable, resource, since, any, positive, rate, of, exploitation, will, eventually, lead, to, the, exhaustion, of, earth, s, finite, stock, 13, this, perspective, renders, the, industrial, revolution, as, a, whole, unsustainable, 20f, 61, 67, 22f, the, sustainable, development, debate, is, based, on, the, assumption, that, societies, need, to, manage, three, types, of, capital, economic, social, and, natural, which, may, be, non, substitutable, and, whose, consumption, might, be, irreversible, natural, capital, can, not, necessarily, be, substituted, by, economic, capital, while, it, is, possible, that, we, can, find, ways, to, replace, some, natural, resources, it, is, much, less, likely, that, they, will, ever, be, able, to, replace, ecosystem, services, such, as, the, protection, provided, by, the, ozone, layer, or, the, climate, stabilizing, function, of, the, amazonian, forest, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, has, been, criticized, from, different, angles, while, some, see, it, as, paradoxical, or, an, oxymoron, and, regard, development, as, inherently, unsustainable, others, are, disappointed, in, the, lack, of, progress, that, has, been, achieved, so, far, part, of, the, problem, is, that, development, itself, is, not, consistently, defined, 16, such, a, viewpoint, contradicts, the, mainstream, academic, community, which, frequently, concedes, that, the, processes, of, capitalism, are, incompatible, with, the, long, term, sustainability, of, human, life, the, vagueness, of, the, brundtland, definition, of, sustainable, development, has, been, criticized, as, follows, 17, the, definition, has, opened, up, the, possibility, of, downplaying, sustainability, hence, governments, spread, the, message, that, we, can, have, it, all, at, the, same, time, i, e, economic, growth, prospering, societies, and, a, healthy, environment, no, new, ethic, is, required, this, so, called, weak, version, of, sustainability, is, popular, among, governments, and, businesses, but, profoundly, wrong, and, not, even, weak, as, there, is, no, alternative, to, preserving, the, earth, s, ecological, integrity, 2, the, 2030, agenda, for, sustainable, development, adopted, by, all, united, nations, members, in, 2015, created, 17, world, sustainable, development, goals, sdgs, they, were, created, with, the, aim, of, peace, and, prosperity, for, people, and, the, planet, while, tackling, climate, change, and, working, to, preserve, oceans, and, forests, the, sdgs, highlight, the, connections, between, the, environmental, social, and, economic, aspects, of, sustainable, development, sustainability, is, at, the, center, of, the, sdgs, the, short, titles, of, the, 17, sdgs, are, no, poverty, sdg, 1, zero, hunger, sdg, 2, good, health, and, well, being, sdg, 3, quality, education, sdg, 4, gender, equality,

nations, it, is, defined, as, education, practices, that, encourage, changes, in, knowledge, skills, values, and, attitudes, to, enable, a, more, sustainable, and, just, society, for, humanity, esd, aims, to, empower, and, equip, current, and, future, generations, to, meet, their, needs, using, a, balanced, and, integrated, approach, to, sustainable, development, s, economic, social, and, environmental, dimensions, agenda, 21, was, the, first, international, document, that, identified, education, as, an, essential, tool, for, achieving, sustainable, development, and, highlighted, areas, of, action, for, education, esd, is, a, component, of, measurement, in, an, indicator, for, sustainable, development, goal, 12, sdg, for, responsible, consumption, and, production, sdg, 12, has, 11, targets, and, target, 12, 8, is, by, 2030, ensure, that, people, everywhere, have, the, relevant, information, and, awareness, for, sustainable, development, and, lifestyles, in, harmony, with, nature, 20, years, after, the, agenda, 21, document, was, declared, the, future, we, want, document, was, proclaimed, in, the, rio, 20, un, conference, on, sustainable, development, stating, that, we, resolve, to, promote, education, for, sustainable, development, and, to, integrate, sustainable, development, more, actively, into, education, beyond, the, decade, of, education, for, sustainable, development, one, version, of, education, for, sustainable, development, recognizes, modern, day, environmental, challenges, it, seeks, to, define, new, ways, to, adjust, to, a, changing, biosphere, as, well, as, engage, individuals, to, address, societal, issues, that, come, with, them, in, the, international, encyclopedia, of, education, this, approach, to, education, is, seen, as, an, attempt, to, shift, consciousness, toward, an, ethics, of, life, giving, relationships, that, respects, the, interconnectedness, of, man, to, his, natural, world, to, equip, future, members, of, society, with, environmental, awareness, and, a, sense, of, responsibility, to, sustainability, for, unesco, education, for, sustainable, development, involves, integrating, key, sustainable, development, issues, into, teaching, and, learning, this, may, include, for, example, instruction, about, climate, change, disaster, risk, reduction, biodiversity, and, poverty, reduction, and, sustainable, consumption, it, also, requires, participatory, teaching, and, learning, methods, that, motivate, and, empower, learners, to, change, their, behaviours, and, take, action, for, sustainable, development, esd, consequently, promotes, competencies, like, critical, thinking, imagining, future, scenarios, and, making, decisions, in, a, collaborative, way, the, thessaloniki, declaration, presented, at, the, international, conference, on, environment, and, society, education, and, public, awareness, for, sustainability, by, unesco, and, the, government, of, greece, december, 1997, highlights, the, importance, of, sustainability, not, only, with, regards, to, the, natural, environment, but, also, with, poverty, health, food, security, democracy, human, rights, and, peace
