a, military, staff, or, general, staff, also, referred, to, as, army, staff, navy, staff, or, air, staff, within, the, individual, services, is, a, group, of, officers, enlisted, and, civilian, staff, who, serve, the, commander, of, a, division, or, other, large, military, unit, in, their, command, and, control, role, through, planning, analysis, and, information, gathering, as, well, as, by, relaying, coordinating, and, supervising, the, execution, of, their, plans, and, orders, especially, in, case, of, multiple, simultaneous, and, rapidly, changing, complex, operations, they, are, organised, into, functional, groups, such, as, administration, logistics, operations, intelligence, training, etc, they, provide, multi, directional, flow, of, information, between, a, commanding, officer, subordinate, military, units, and, other, stakeholders, a, centralised, general, staff, results, in, tighter, top, down, control, but, requires, larger, staff, at, headquarters, hq, and, reduces, accuracy, of, orientation, of, field, operations, whereas, a, decentralised, general, staff, results, in, enhanced, situational, focus, personal, initiative, speed, of, localised, action, ooda, loop, and, improved, accuracy, of, orientation, a, commander, commands, through, their, personal, authority, decision, making, and, leadership, and, uses, general, staff, to, exercise, the, control, on, their, behalf, in, a, large, unit, most, nato, nations, including, the, united, states, and, most, european, nations, use, the, continental, staff, system, which, has, origin, in, napoleon, s, military, the, commonwealth, staff, system, used, by, most, of, the, commonwealth, has, its, origin, in, the, british, military, one, of, the, key, purposes, of, a, military, staff, is, to, provide, accurate, timely, information, which, includes, the, results, of, contingency, planning, on, which, command, decisions, are, based, a, goal, is, being, able, to, suggest, approaches, or, help, produce, well, informed, decisions, that, will, effectively, manage, and, conserve, unit, resources, in, addition, to, generating, information, the, staff, also, manages, the, flow, of, communication, within, the, unit, and, around, it, while, controlled, information, flow, toward, the, commander, is, a, priority, those, useful, or, contingent, in, nature, are, communicated, to, lower, level, units, and, or, through, their, respective, staffs, if, the, information, is, not, pertinent, to, the, unit, it, is, redirected, to, the, command, level, which, can, best, utilize, the, condition, or, information, staffs, are, generally, the, first, to, know, of, issues, that, affect, its, group, issues, that, require, major, decisions, affecting, the, unit, s, operational, capability, are, communicated, to, the, commanding, officer, however, not, all, issues, will, be, handled, by, the, commander, smaller, matters, that, arise, are, given, to, a, more, appropriate, tasker, within, the, unit, to, be, handled, and, resolved, which, would, otherwise, be, an, unnecessary, distraction, for, the, commanding, officer, who, already, makes, numerous, decisions, every, day, in, addition, a, staff, aims, to, carefully, craft, any, useful, situations, and, utilize, that, information, in, a, generic, command, staff, more, seasoned, and, senior, officers, oversee, staff, sections, of, groups, organized, by, the, needs, of, the, unit, senior, enlisted, personnel, task, personnel, in, the, maintenance, of, tactical, equipment, and, vehicles, senior, analysts, are, tasked, with, the, finalizing, of, reports, and, their, enlisted, personnel, participate, in, the, acquisition, of, information, from, subordinate, staffs, and, units, this, hierarchy, places, decision, making, and, reporting, under, the, auspices, of, the, most, experienced, personnel, and, maximizes, information, flow, of, pertinent, information, sent, out, of, the, command, overall, clarifying, matters, overall, this, frees, up, the, most, senior, members, of, the, command, at, each, level, for, decision, making, and, issuing, direction, for, further, research, or, information, gathering, perhaps, requiring, men, to, put, their, lives, at, risk, to, gather, additional, intelligence, operations, staff, officers, also, are, tasked, with, battle, planning, both, for, offensive, and, defensive, conditions, and, issuing, contingency, plans, for, handling, situations, anticipated, during, the, foreseeable, future, prior, to, the, late, 18th, century, there, was, generally, no, organizational, support, for, staff, functions, such, as, military, intelligence, logistics, planning, or, personnel, unit, commanders, handled, such, functions, for, their, units, with, informal, help, from, subordinates, who, were, usually, not, trained, for, or, assigned, to, a, specific, task, count, leopold, joseph, von, daun, in, a, letter, to, empress, maria, theresa, in, january, 1758, pressed, for, a, more, important, role, for, the, generalquartiermeister, chief, of, staff, the, failures, in, the, army, especially, at, the, battle, of, leuthen, made, it, clear, that, austria, had, no, great, brain, and, the, command, needed, to, spread, the, workload, to, allow, the, commander, in, chief, the, time, to, consider, the, strategic, picture, the, 1757, regulations, had, created, the, grosse, feldgeneralstab, and, kleine, generalstab, large, and, small, general, staff, and, after, changes, in, 1769, a, permanent, staff, of, 30, officers, was, established, under, the, direction, of, franz, moritz, von, lacy, which, would, be, expanded, in, wartime, with, junior, officers, the, grosse, staff, was, divided, into, three, first, the, intrinsecum, which, handled, internal, administration, and, directing, operations, secondly, external, activities, including, the, pioneers, thirdly, the, inspection, service, which, handled, the, issuing, of, orders, and, prisoners, of, war, alongside, the, general, staff, was, the, general, adjutant, who, led, a, group, of, adjutant, staff, selected, by, the, army, commanders, to, handle, the, details, of, internal, administration, and, collating, intelligence, and, answered, to, the, commander, in, chief, the, chief, of, staff, became, the, chief, adviser, to, the, commander, in, chief, and, in, a, fundamental, move, away, from, the, previous, administrative, role, the, chief, of, staff, now, undertook, operational, planning, while, delegating, the, routine, work, to, his, senior, staff, officers, staff, officers, were, drawn, from, line, units, and, would, later, return, to, them, the, intention, being, that, they, would, prove, themselves, as, leaders, during, their, time, with, the, staff, in, a, battle, or, when, the, army, had, detached, corps, a, small, number, of, staff, would, be, allocated, to, the, column, commander, as, a, smaller, version, of, headquarters, the, senior, man, usually, a, major, would, be, the, chief, of, the, column, staff, and, his, principal, task, would, be, to, help, the, commander, to, understand, what, was, intended, when, karl, mack, von, leiberich, became, chief, of, staff, of, the, army, under, prince, josias, of, saxe, coburg, saalfeld, in, the, netherlands, he, issued, the, instruktionspunkte, f, r, gesammte, herren, generals, the, last, of, 19, points, setting, out, the, roles, of, staff, officers, dealing, with, offensive, and, defensive, operations, while, helping, the, commander, in, chief, in, 1796, archduke, charles, duke, of, teschen, augmented, these, with, his, own, observationspunkte, writing, of, the, chief, of, staff, he, is, duty, bound, to, consider, all, possibilities, related, to, operations, and, not, view, himself, as, merely, carrying, out, those, instructions, on, 20, march, 1801, feldmarschalleutnant, duka, became, the, world, s, first, peacetime, generalquartiermeister, at, the, head, of, the, staff, and, the, wartime, role, of, the, chief, of, staff, was, now, focused, on, planning, and, operations, to, assist, the, commander, archduke, charles, duke, of, teschen, himself, produced, a, new, dienstvorschrift, on, 1, september, 1805, which, divided, the, staff, into, three, 1, political, correspondence, 2, the, operations, directorate, dealing, with, planning, and, intelligence, 3, the, service, directorate, dealing, with, administration, supply, and, military, justice, the, archduke, set, out, the, position, of, a, modern, chief, of, staff, the, chief, of, staff, stands, at, the, side, of, the, commander, in, chief, and, is, completely, at, his, disposal, his, sphere, of, work, connects, him, with, no, specific, unit, the, commander, in, chief, decides, what, should, happen, and, how, his, chief, assistant, works, out, these, decisions, so, that, each, subordinate, understands, his, allotted, task, with, the, creation, of, the, korps, in, 1809, each, had, a, staff, whose, chief, was, responsible, for, directing, operations, and, executing, the, overall, headquarters, plan, the, staff, on, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1809, numbered, over, 170, finally, in, 1811, joseph, radetzky, von, radetz, produced, his, ber, die, bessere, einrichtung, des, generalstabs, which, prioritised, the, chief, of, staff, s, managerial, and, supervisory, role, with, the, departments, political, correspondence, operations, and, service, under, their, own, directors, effectively, merging, the, adjutants, and, general, staff, officers, in, this, system, lay, the, beginnings, of, a, formal, staff, corps, whose, members, could, specialise, in, operations, intelligence, and, logistics, despite, a, short, lived, permanent, staff, under, st, cyr, 1783, 90, the, french, reverted, to, the, old, system, in, 1790, when, the, revolutionary, government, abolished, the, staff, corps, when, general, louis, alexandre, berthier, was, appointed, chief, of, staff, to, the, french, army, of, italy, in, 1795, his, was, the, old, administrative, role, accurately, described, by, jomini, and, vachee, as, the, chief, clerk, and, of, limited, competence, his, manual, is, merely, a, reporting, system, as, a, kind, of, office, manual, staff, officers, were, rotated, out, of, the, line, on, the, austrian, model, but, received, no, training, and, merely, became, efficient, in, the, administrative, tasks, especially, the, rapid, issuance, of, orders, it, suited, napoleon, bonaparte, from, the, moment, he, took, over, the, army, the, following, year, and, he, would, use, berthier, s, system, throughout, his, wars, crucially, napoleon, remained, his, own, intelligence, chief, and, operational, planner, a, workload, which, ultimately, not, even, he, could, cope, with, overall, staff, system, structure, is, generally, similar, to, the, pre, 1984, british, army, system, with, g, branch, a, branch, and, q, branch, with, slightly, different, staff, officer, position, names, unlike, the, continental, system, 1, is, higher, ranking, than, 2, followed, by, 3, despite, being, called, gso, aso, and, qso, in, english, all, of, them, are, translated, as, either, for, g, or, for, a, and, q, in, burmese, you, can, check, the, 2010, 2011, military, command, structure, of, myanmar, in, the, photo, shown, below, which, still, uses, the, same, staff, system, g, branch, called, or, for, short, in, burmese, is, responsible, for, responsible, for, intelligence, training, and, every, aspect, of, operations, general, staff, officer, grade, 1, informally, known, as, g1, ranked, lieutenant, colonel, or, a, colonel, general, staff, officer, grade, 2, informally, known, as, g2, ranked, major, general, staff, officer, grade, 3, informally, known, as, g3, ranked, captain, a, branch, called, or, for, short, in, burmese, is, responsible, for, every, aspect, of, personnel, management, such, as, medical, and, military, adjutant, staff, officer, grade, 1, informally, known, as, a1, ranked, lieutenant, colonel, or, a, colonel, adjutant, staff, officer, grade, 2, informally, known, as, a2, ranked, major, adjutant, staff, officer, grade, 3, informally, known, as, a3,

officer, grade, 3, informally, known, as, q3, ranked, captain, prussia, adopted, austria, s, approach, in, the, following, years, especially, when, gerhard, von, scharnhorst, who, as, a, hanoverian, staff, officer, had, worked, with, the, austrian, army, in, the, austrian, netherlands, in, the, early, 1790s, took, charge, initially, the, prussian, army, assigned, a, limited, number, of, technical, expert, officers, to, support, field, commanders, before, 1746, however, reforms, had, added, management, of, intelligence, and, contingency, planning, to, the, staff, s, duties, later, the, practice, was, initiated, of, rotating, officers, from, command, to, staff, assignments, and, back, to, familiarize, them, with, both, aspects, of, military, operations, a, practice, that, with, the, addition, of, enlisted, personnel, continues, to, be, used, after, 1806, prussia, s, military, academies, trained, mid, level, officers, in, specialist, staff, skills, in, 1814, prussia, formally, established, by, law, a, central, military, command, prussian, general, staff, and, a, separate, staff, for, each, division, and, corps, despite, some, professional, and, political, issues, with, the, prussian, system, especially, when, viewed, through, the, prism, of, the, 20th, century, world, wars, their, general, staff, concept, has, been, adopted, by, many, large, armies, in, existence, today, before, the, crimean, war, staff, work, was, looked, at, with, great, disdain, in, the, british, army, the, hardships, of, that, war, caused, by, disorganization, led, to, a, change, in, attitude, the, general, staff, in, britain, was, formed, in, 1905, and, reorganized, again, in, 1908, unlike, the, prussian, staff, system, the, british, army, was, thought, too, small, to, support, separate, staff, and, command, career, streams, officers, would, typically, alternate, between, staff, and, command, beevor, inside, the, british, army, says, instead, that, the, terrible, cleavages, between, staff, and, line, units, caused, by, the, enormous, losses, during, the, trench, warfare, of, the, world, war, i, meant, that, senior, british, officers, consequently, decided, that, all, officers, would, rotate, between, staff, and, line, responsibilities, preventing, the, development, of, a, separate, general, staff, corps, the, national, security, act, of, 1947, instead, created, a, joint, staff, populated, by, military, service, members, who, rather, than, becoming, career, staff, officers, on, the, german, general, staff, model, rotate, into, and, back, out, of, joint, staff, positions, following, the, major, revision, of, title, 10, of, the, united, states, code, by, the, goldwater, nichols, act, in, 1986, the, joint, staff, of, today, works, directly, for, the, chairman, of, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, rather, than, the, corporate, joint, chiefs, of, staff, as, they, did, from, 1947, to, 1986, under, this, scheme, operational, command, and, control, of, military, forces, are, not, the, province, of, the, joint, staff, but, that, of, combatant, commanders, who, report, through, the, chairman, of, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, unless, otherwise, directed, to, the, secretary, of, defense, the, continental, staff, system, also, known, as, the, general, staff, system, gss, is, used, by, most, nato, countries, in, structuring, their, militaries, staff, functions, in, this, system, which, is, based, on, one, originally, employed, by, the, french, army, in, the, 19th, century, each, staff, position, in, a, headquarters, or, unit, is, assigned, a, letter, prefix, corresponding, to, the, formation, s, element, and, one, or, more, numbers, specifying, a, role, the, staff, numbers, are, assigned, according, to, custom, not, hierarchy, traceable, back, to, french, practice, i, e, 1, is, not, higher, ranking, than, 2, this, list, reflects, the, shape, structure, since, the, original, continental, staff, system, only, covered, branches, 1, through, 6, it, is, not, uncommon, to, see, 7, through, 9, omitted, or, having, various, meanings, common, variation, include, merging, of, 3, and, 5, to, 3, operations, and, plans, omitting, the, training, branch, and, utilizing, 7, for, engineering, as, seen, in, us, military, sealift, command, and, multinational, forces, iraq, mnf, i, and, replacing, 9, with, a, legal, branch, making, cimic, a, part, of, another, branch, i, e, 2, or, 4, as, seen, with, the, uk, permanent, joint, headquarters, derived, from, the, prussian, gro, e, generalstab, great, general, staff, traditionally, these, staff, functions, were, prefixed, by, the, simple, g, which, is, retained, in, place, for, modern, army, usage, but, the, increasing, complexity, of, modern, armies, not, to, speak, of, the, spread, of, the, staff, concept, to, naval, air, and, other, elements, has, demanded, the, addition, of, new, prefixes, these, element, prefixes, are, on, some, occasions, the, letter, e, can, also, be, observed, though, it, is, not, an, official, term, in, that, case, it, is, for, element, and, it, will, be, used, to, identify, a, small, independent, element, that, is, a, part, of, a, non, staff, organization, i, e, an, e3, is, an, operational, element, on, a, logistics, site, or, an, e4, is, a, logistics, element, on, a, forward, medical, support, site, thus, the, personnel, officer, of, a, naval, headquarters, would, be, referred, to, as, n1, in, reality, in, large, organizations, each, of, these, staff, functions, will, require, the, support, of, its, own, large, staff, so, n1, refers, both, to, the, office, and, the, officer, in, charge, of, it, the, continental, staff, system, can, be, carried, down, to, the, next, level, j1, 3, or, j13, sometimes, the, dot, separator, is, omitted, is, thus, the, operations, officer, of, the, personnel, office, of, a, joint, headquarters, but, the, exact, definition, of, the, roles, at, this, level, may, vary, below, this, numbers, can, be, attached, following, a, hyphen, but, these, are, usually, only, positional, numbers, assigned, arbitrarily, to, identify, individuals, g2, 3, 2, could, be, the, budget, officer, in, the, operations, section, of, the, intelligence, department, a1, 1, 1, 1, might, simply, be, a, receptionist, the, manpower, or, personnel, officer, supervises, personnel, and, administration, systems, this, department, functions, as, the, essential, administrative, liaison, between, the, subordinate, units, and, the, headquarters, handling, personnel, actions, coming, from, the, bottom, up, such, as, a, request, for, an, award, to, be, given, to, a, particular, soldier, or, from, the, top, down, such, as, orders, being, received, from, the, army, level, directing, that, a, particular, soldier, be, reassigned, to, a, new, unit, outside, the, command, in, army, units, this, person, is, often, called, the, adjutant, the, s, 1, also, works, with, the, postal, mailing, office, and, deals, with, awards, and, ranks, as, well, the, intelligence, section, is, responsible, for, collecting, and, analyzing, intelligence, information, about, the, enemy, to, determine, what, the, enemy, is, doing, or, might, do, to, prevent, the, accomplishment, of, the, enemy, s, mission, this, office, may, also, control, maps, and, geographical, information, systems, and, data, at, the, unit, level, the, s, 2, is, the, unit, s, security, officer, and, the, s, 2, section, manages, all, security, clearance, issues, for, the, unit, s, personnel, other, duties, of, the, s, 2, often, include, intelligence, oversight, and, physical, security, the, operations, office, may, include, plans, and, training, the, operations, office, plans, and, coordinates, operations, and, all, things, necessary, to, enable, the, formation, to, operate, and, accomplish, its, mission, in, most, units, the, operations, office, is, the, largest, of, the, staff, sections, and, considered, the, most, important, all, aspects, of, sustaining, the, unit, s, operations, planning, future, operations, and, additionally, planning, and, executing, all, unit, training, fall, under, the, responsibility, of, operations, the, operations, office, is, also, tasked, with, keeping, track, of, the, weekly, training, schedules, in, most, military, units, i, e, battalion, regiment, and, brigade, the, operations, officer, carries, the, same, rank, as, the, executive, officer, xo, but, ranks, third, in, the, unit, s, chain, of, command, while, the, other, staff, officers, are, one, rank, lower, for, example, in, a, battalion, the, s, 3, would, hold, the, rank, of, major, like, the, battalion, xo, while, the, remaining, staff, officers, are, captains, or, lieutenants, the, logistics, office, is, responsible, for, managing, the, wide, scope, of, materiel, transport, facilities, services, and, medical, health, support, by, nato, doctrine, the, logistic, staff, is, tasked, with, overseeing, logistic, aspects, and, principles, where, the, focus, is, that, logistic, support, must, be, focused, towards, ensuring, the, success, of, the, operation, and, prescriptions, of, elements, such, as, responsibility, and, authority, a, logistic, staff, may, be, divided, into, sections, based, on, branch, or, geographic, area, each, section, may, in, turn, also, be, divided, into, tasks, and, roles, the, size, of, the, logistic, staff, can, vary, greatly, depending, on, the, environment, and, complexity, of, operations, nato, in, example, work, with, a, multinational, joint, logistic, centre, which, exists, outside, of, the, force, commander, s, staff, but, runs, as, a, separate, entity, unit, with, only, a, few, logistic, personnel, in, the, commander, s, staff, who, act, as, liaisons, the, plans, and, strategy, office, is, responsible, for, civil, military, operations, cmo, strategy, planning, at, the, unit, level, the, s, 5, is, the, primary, adviser, to, the, commander, on, the,

electronic, systems, within, a, unit, to, include, computers, faxes, copy, machines, and, phone, systems, the, training, branch, will, organize, and, coordinate, training, activity, conducted, by, a, headquarters, and, also, supervise, and, support, subordinate, units, the, finance, branch, not, to, be, confused, with, administration, from, which, it, has, split, sets, the, finance, policy, for, the, operation, operationally, the, administration, and, finance, may, be, interlinked, but, have, separate, reporting, chains, civil, military, co, operation, or, civil, affairs, are, the,

civilian, populace, in, a, friendly, neutral, or, hostile, area, of, operations, in, order, to, facilitate, military, operations, and, consolidate, and, achieve, mission, objectives, the, commonwealth, staff, system, used, by, most, commonwealth, nations, is, largely, based, on, the, british, military, s, staff, system, with, nation, specific, variations, following, australia, s, federation, in, 1901, the, australian, commonwealth, military, forces, now, the, australian, army, adopted, many, of, the, practices, of, the, british, army, including, its, staff, system, while, this, approach, was, modified, and, adapted, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, the, british, three, branch, system, and, nomenclature, remained, a, feature, of, australian, practice, until, 1997, when, it, adopted, the, common, joint, staff, system, based, on, the, nato, or, continental, general, staff, system, across, all, three, services, the, primary, reasons, given, for, this, were, the, ability, to, standardise, staff, organisations, across, the, breadth, and, depth, of, the, services, and, improve, interoperability, between, america, britain, canada, and, australia, as, well, as, nato, partners, that, employed, this, system, at, this, time, the, australian, defence, force, also, developed, its, own, joint, military, appreciation, proces, s, jmap, itself, derived, from,

commander, of, the, canadian, army, is, also, titled, as, chief, of, army, staff, the, british, staff, system, was, a, product, of, the, esher, committee, report, of, 1904, which, investigated, the, conduct, of, the, late, victorian, era, british, army, in, the, second, anglo, boer, war, and, the, haldane, reforms, from, 1906, 1912, this, staff, system, was, captured, in, field, service, regulations, part, ii, organisation, and, administration, released, in, 1909, and, later, in, the, staff, manual, 1912, this, system, remained, in, use, until, 1984, when, the, united, kingdom, began, to, use, the, continental, or, nato, system, the, british, staff, system, was, based, on, the, following, in, the, british, system, staff, are, outranked, by, command, officers, the, staff, cannot,
