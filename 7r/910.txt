military, strategy, is, a, set, of, ideas, implemented, by, military, organizations, to, pursue, desired, strategic, goals, derived, from, the, greek, word, strategos, the, term, strategy, when, first, used, during, the, 18th, century, was, seen, in, its, narrow, sense, as, the, art, of, the, general, or, the, art, of, arrangement, of, troops, and, deals, with, the, planning, and, conduct, of, campaigns, the, movement, and, disposition, of, forces, and, the, deception, of, the, enemy, the, father, of, western, modern, strategic, studies, carl, von, clausewitz, 1780, 1831, defined, military, strategy, as, the, employment, of, battles, to, gain, the, end, of, war, b, h, liddell, hart, s, definition, put, less, emphasis, on, battles, defining, strategy, as, the, art, of, distributing, and, applying, military, means, to, fulfill, the, ends, of, policy, hence, both, gave, the, pre, eminence, to, political, aims, over, military, goals, sun, tzu, 544, 496, bc, is, often, considered, as, the, father, of, eastern, military, strategy, and, greatly, influenced, chinese, japanese, korean, and, vietnamese, historical, and, modern, war, tactics, the, art, of, war, by, sun, tzu, grew, in, popularity, and, saw, practical, use, in, western, society, as, well, it, continues, to, influence, many, competitive, endeavors, in, asia, europe, and, america, including, culture, politics, and, business, as, well, as, modern, warfare, the, eastern, military, strategy, differs, from, the, western, by, focusing, more, on, asymmetric, warfare, and, deception, chanakya, s, arthashastra, has, been, an, important, strategic, and, political, compendium, in, indian, and, asian, history, as, well, strategy, differs, from, operations, and, tactics, in, that, strategy, refers, to, the, employment, of, a, nation, s, entire, military, capabilities, through, high, level, and, long, term, planning, development, and, procurement, to, guarantee, security, or, victory, operations, and, tactics, is, the, art, of, organizing, forces, on, or, near, the, battlefield, to, secure, objectives, as, part, of, the, broader, military, strategy, military, strategy, is, the, planning, and, execution, of, the, contest, between, groups, of, armed, adversaries, it, is, a, subdiscipline, of, warfare, and, of, foreign, policy, and, a, principal, tool, to, secure, national, interests, its, perspective, is, larger, than, military, tactics, which, involve, the, disposition, and, manoeuvre, of, units, on, a, particular, sea, or, battlefield, but, less, broad, than, grand, strategy, otherwise, called, national, strategy, which, is, the, overarching, strategy, of, the, largest, of, organizations, such, as, the, nation, state, confederation, or, international, alliance, and, involves, using, diplomatic, informational, military, and, economic, resources, military, strategy, involves, using, military, resources, such, as, people, equipment, and, information, against, the, opponent, s, resources, to, gain, supremacy, or, reduce, the, opponent, s, will, to, fight, developed, through, the, precepts, of, military, science, nato, s, definition, of, strategy, is, presenting, the, manner, in, which, military, power, should, be, developed, and, applied, to, achieve, national, objectives, or, those, of, a, group, of, nations, strategy, may, be, divided, into, grand, strategy, geopolitical, in, scope, and, military, strategy, that, converts, the, geopolitical, policy, objectives, into, militarily, achievable, goals, and, campaigns, field, marshal, viscount, alanbrooke, chief, of, the, imperial, general, staff, and, co, chairman, of, the, anglo, us, combined, chiefs, of, staff, committee, for, most, of, the, second, world, war, described, the, art, of, military, strategy, as, to, derive, from, the, aim, a, series, of, military, objectives, to, be, achieved, to, assess, these, objectives, as, to, the, military, requirements, they, create, and, the, pre, conditions, which, the, achievement, of, each, is, likely, to, necessitate, to, measure, available, and, potential, resources, against, the, requirements, and, to, chart, from, this, process, a, coherent, pattern, of, priorities, and, a, rational, course, of, action, field, marshal, montgomery, summed, it, up, thus, strategy, is, the, art, of, distributing, and, applying, military, means, such, as, armed, forces, and, supplies, to, fulfil, the, ends, of, policy, tactics, means, the, dispositions, for, and, control, of, military, forces, and, techniques, in, actual, fighting, put, more, shortly, strategy, is, the, art, of, the, conduct, of, war, tactics, the, art, of, fighting, military, strategy, in, the, 19th, century, was, still, viewed, as, one, of, a, trivium, of, arts, or, sciences, that, govern, the, conduct, of, warfare, the, others, being, tactics, the, execution, of, plans, and, maneuvering, of, forces, in, battle, and, logistics, the, maintenance, of, an, army, the, view, had, prevailed, since, the, roman, times, and, the, borderline, between, strategy, and, tactics, at, this, time, was, blurred, and, sometimes, categorization, of, a, decision, is, a, matter, of, almost, personal, opinion, carnot, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, thought, it, simply, involved, concentration, of, troops, strategy, and, tactics, are, closely, related, and, exist, on, the, same, continuum, modern, thinking, places, the, operational, level, between, them, all, deal, with, distance, time, and, force, but, strategy, is, large, scale, can, endure, through, years, and, is, societal, while, tactics, are, small, scale, and, involve, the, disposition, of, fewer, elements, enduring, hours, to, weeks, originally, strategy, was, understood, to, govern, the, prelude, to, a, battle, while, tactics, controlled, its, execution, however, in, the, world, wars, of, the, 20th, century, the, distinction, between, maneuver, and, battle, strategy, and, tactics, expanded, with, the, capacity, of, technology, and, transit, tactics, that, were, once, the, province, of, a, company, of, cavalry, would, be, applied, to, a, panzer, army, it, is, often, said, that, the, art, of, strategies, defines, the, goals, to, achieve, in, a, military, campaign, while, tactics, defines, the, methods, to, achieve, these, goals, strategic, goals, could, be, we, want, to, conquer, area, x, or, we, want, to, stop, country, y, s, expansion, in, world, trade, in, commodity, z, while, tactical, decisions, range, from, a, general, statement, e, g, we, re, going, to, do, this, by, a, naval, invasion, of, the, north, of, country, x, we, re, going, to, blockade, the, ports, of, country, y, to, a, more, specific, c, platoon, will, attack, while, d, platoon, provides, fire, cover, in, its, purest, form, strategy, dealt, solely, with, military, issues, in, earlier, societies, a, king, or, political, leader, was, often, the, same, person, as, the, military, leader, if, not, the, distance, of, communication, between, the, political, and, the, military, leader, was, small, but, as, the, need, of, a, professional, army, grew, the, bounds, between, the, politicians, and, the, military, came, to, be, recognized, in, many, cases, it, was, decided, that, there, was, a, need, for, a, separation, as, french, statesman, georges, clemenceau, said, war, is, too, important, a, business, to, be, left, to, soldiers, this, gave, rise, to, the, concept, of, the, grand, strategy, which, encompasses, the, management, of, the, resources, of, an, entire, nation, in, the, conduct, of, warfare, in, the, environment, of, the, grand, strategy, the, military, component, is, largely, reduced, to, operational, strategy, the, planning, and, control, of, large, military, units, such, as, corps, and, divisions, as, the, size, and, number, of, the, armies, grew, and, the, technology, to, communicate, and, control, improved, the, difference, between, military, strategy, and, grand, strategy, shrank, fundamental, to, grand, strategy, is, the, diplomacy, through, which, a, nation, might, forge, alliances, or, pressure, another, nation, into, compliance, thereby, achieving, victory, without, resorting, to, combat, another, element, of, grand, strategy, is, the, management, of, the, post, war, peace, as, clausewitz, stated, a, successful, military, strategy, may, be, a, means, to, an, end, but, it, is, not, an, end, in, itself, there, are, numerous, examples, in, history, where, victory, on, the, battlefield, has, not, translated, into, goals, such, as, long, term, peace, security, or, tranquillity, many, military, strategists, have, attempted, to, encapsulate, a, successful, strategy, in, a, set, of, principles, sun, tzu, defined, 13, principles, in, his, the, art, of, war, while, napoleon, listed, 115, maxims, american, civil, war, general, nathan, bedford, forrest, had, only, one, to, there, first, with, the, most, men, the, concepts, given, as, essential, in, the, united, states, army, field, manual, of, military, operations, fm, 3, 0, are, according, to, greene, and, armstrong, some, planners, assert, adhering, to, the, fundamental, principles, guarantees, victory, while, others, claim, war, is, unpredictable, and, the, strategist, must, be, flexible, others, argue, predictability, could, be, increased, if, the, protagonists, were, to, view, the, situation, from, the, other, sides, in, a, conflict, field, marshal, count, helmuth, von, moltke, expressed, strategy, as, a, system, of, ad, hoc, expedients, by, which, a, general, must, take, action, while, under, pressure, these, underlying, principles, of, strategy, have, survived, relatively, unchanged, as, the, technology, of, warfare, has, developed, strategy, and, tactics, must, constantly, evolve, in, response, to, technological, advances, a, successful, strategy, from, one, era, tends, to, remain, in, favor, long, after, new, developments, in, military, weaponry, and, mat, riel, have, rendered, it, obsolete, world, war, i, and, to, a, great, extent, the, american, civil, war, saw, napoleonic, tactics, of, offense, at, all, costs, pitted, against, the, defensive, power, of, the, trench, machine, gun, and, barbed, wire, as, a, reaction, to, its, world, war, i, experience, france, attempted, to, use, its, maginot, line, to, apply, the, principles, of, mass, and, economy, of, force, in, that, troops, could, be, concentrated, in, the, north, for, an, offensive, there, while, the, line, acted, as, force, multiplier, in, the, south, and, maneuver, and, security, by, preventing, the, germans, from, going, directly, from, alsace, to, paris, the, principles, of, military, strategy, emerged, at, least, as, far, back, as, 500, bc, in, the, works, of, sun, tzu, and, chanakya, the, campaigns, of, alexander, the, great, chandragupta, maurya, hannibal, qin, shi, huang, julius, caesar, zhuge, liang, khalid, ibn, al, walid, and, in, particular, cyrus, the, great, demonstrate, strategic, planning, and, movement, mahan, describes, in, the, preface, to, the, influence, of, sea, power, upon, history, how, the, romans, used, their, sea, power, to, effectively, block, the, sea, lines, of, communication, of, hannibal, with, carthage, and, so, via, a, maritime, strategy, achieved, hannibal, s, removal, from, italy, despite, never, beating, him, there, with, their, legions, one, of, these, strategies, was, shown, in, the, battle, between, greek, city, states, and, persia, the, battle, of, thermopylae, in, which, the, greek, forces, were, outnumbered, stood, as, a, good, military, strategy, the, greek, allied, forces, ultimately, lost, the, battle, but, the, training, use, of, armor, and, location, allowed, them, to, defeat, many, persian, troops, before, losing, in, the, end, the, greek, alliance, lost, the, battle, but, not, the, war, as, a, result, of, that, strategy, which, continued, on, to, the, battle, of, plataea, the, battle, of, plataea, in, 479, bc, resulted, in, a, victory, for, the, greeks, against, persia, which, exemplified, that, military, strategy, was, extremely, beneficial, to, defeating, a, numerous, enemy, early, strategies, included, the, strategy, of, annihilation, exhaustion, attrition, warfare, scorched, earth, action, blockade, guerrilla, campaign, deception, and, feint, ingenuity, and, adeptness, were, limited, only, by, imagination, accord, and, technology, strategists, continually, exploited, ever, advancing, technology, the, word, strategy, itself, derives, from, the, greek, strategia, office, of, general, command, generalship, in, turn, from, strategos, leader, or, commander, of, an, army, general, a, compound, of, stratos, army, host, agos, leader, chief, in, turn, from, ago, to, lead, no, evidence, exists, of, it, being, used, in, a, modern, sense, in, ancient, greek, but, we, find, it, in, byzantine, documents, from, the, 6th, century, onwards, and, most, notably, in, the, work, attributed, to, emperor, leo, vi, the, wise, of, byzantium, as, a, counterpoint, to, european, developments, in, the, strategic, art, the, mongol, emperor, genghis, khan, provides, a, useful, example, genghis, successes, and, those, of, his, successors, were, based, on, manoeuvre, and, terror, the, main, focus, of, genghis, strategic, assault, was, the, psychology, of, the, opposing, population, by, steady, and, meticulous, implementation, of, this, strategy, genghis, and, his, descendants, were, able, to, conquer, most, of, eurasia, the, building, blocks, of, genghis, army, and, his, strategy, were, his, tribal, levies, of, mounted, archers, scorched, earth, style, methods, and, equally, essential, the, vast, horse, herds, of, mongolia, each, archer, had, at, least, one, extra, horse, there, was, an, average, of, five, horses, per, man, thus, the, entire, army, could, move, with, astounding, rapidity, moreover, since, horse, milk, and, horse, blood, were, the, staples, of, the, mongolian, diet, genghis, horse, herds, functioned, not, just, as, his, means, of, movement, but, as, his, logistical, sustainment, all, other, necessities, would, be, foraged, and, plundered, khan, s, marauders, also, brought, with, them, mobile, shelters, concubines, butchers, and, cooks, through, maneuver, and, continuous, assault, chinese, persian, arab, and, eastern, european, armies, could, be, stressed, until, they, collapsed, and, were, then, annihilated, in, pursuit, and, encirclement, compared, to, the, armies, of, genghis, nearly, all, other, armies, were, cumbersome, and, relatively, static, it, was, not, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, that, any, army, was, able, to, match, the, speed, of, deployment, of, genghis, armies, when, confronted, with, a, fortified, city, the, mongol, imperatives, of, maneuver, and, speed, required, that, it, be, quickly, subdued, here, the, terror, engendered, by, the, bloody, reputation, of, the, mongolians, helped, to, intimidate, and, subdue, so, too, did, primitive, biological, warfare, a, trebuchet, or, other, type, of, ballista, weapon, would, be, used, to, launch, dead, animals, and, corpses, into, a, besieged, city, spreading, disease, and, death, such, as, the, black, plague, if, a, particular, town, or, city, displeased, the, mongolian, khan, everyone, in, the, city, would, be, killed, to, set, an, example, for, all, other, cities, this, was, early, psychological, warfare, to, refer, to, the, nine, strategic, principles, outlined, above, the, mongol, strategy, was, directed, toward, an, objective, that, schwerpunkt, main, focus, being, the, morale, and, mental, state, of, the, opposing, population, achieved, through, the, offensive, this, offensive, was, itself, characterized, by, concentration, of, force, maneuver, surprise, and, simplicity, in, 1520, niccol, machiavelli, s, dell, arte, della, guerra, art, of, war, dealt, with, the, relationship, between, civil, and, military, matters, and, the, formation, of, grand, strategy, in, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, gustavus, adolphus, of, sweden, demonstrated, advanced, operational, strategy, that, led, to, his, victories, on, the, soil, of, the, holy, roman, empire, it, was, not, until, the, 18th, century, that, military, strategy, was, subjected, to, serious, study, in, europe, the, word, was, first, used, in, german, as, strategie, in, a, translation, of, leo, vi, s, tactica, in, 1777, by, johann, von, bourscheid, from, then, onwards, the, use, of, the, word, spread, throughout, the, west, in, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 1763, frederick, the, great, improvised, a, strategy, of, exhaustion, see, attrition, warfare, to, hold, off, his, opponents, and, conserve, his, prussian, forces, assailed, from, all, sides, by, france, austria, russia, and, sweden, frederick, exploited, his, central, position, which, enabled, him, to, move, his, army, along, interior, lines, and, concentrate, against, one, opponent, at, a, time, unable, to, achieve, victory, he, was, able, to, stave, off, defeat, until, a, diplomatic, solution, emerged, frederick, s, victory, led, to, great, significance, being, placed, on, geometric, strategy, which, emphasized, lines, of, manoeuvre, awareness, of, terrain, and, possession, of, critical, strong, points, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, the, napoleonic, wars, that, followed, revolutionized, military, strategy, the, impact, of, this, period, was, still, to, be, felt, in, the, american, civil, war, and, the, early, phases, of, world, war, i, with, the, advent, of, cheap, small, arms, and, the, rise, of, the, drafted, citizen, soldier, armies, grew, rapidly, in, size, to, become, massed, formations, this, necessitated, dividing, the, army, first, into, divisions, and, later, into, corps, along, with, divisions, came, divisional, artillery, light, weight, mobile, cannon, with, great, range, and, firepower, the, rigid, formations, of, pikemen, and, musketeers, firing, massed, volleys, gave, way, to, light, infantry, fighting, in, skirmish, lines, napoleon, i, of, france, took, advantage, of, these, developments, to, pursue, an, effective, battle, of, annihilation, napoleon, invariably, sought, to, achieve, decision, in, battle, with, the, sole, aim, of, utterly, destroying, his, opponent, usually, achieving, success, through, superior, maneuver, as, ruler, and, general, he, dealt, with, the, grand, strategy, as, well, as, the, operational, strategy, making, use, of, political, and, economic, measures, while, not, the, originator, of, the, methods, he, used, napoleon, effectively, combined, the, relatively, superior, maneuver, and, battle, stages, into, one, event, before, this, general, officers, had, considered, this, approach, to, battle, as, separate, events, however, napoleon, used, the, maneuver, to, battle, to, dictate, how, and, where, the, battle, would, progress, the, battle, of, austerlitz, was, a, perfect, example, of, this, maneuver, napoleon, withdrew, from, a, strong, position, to, draw, his, opponent, forward, and, tempt, him, into, a, flank, attack, weakening, his, center, this, allowed, the, french, army, to, split, the, allied, army, and, gain, victory, napoleon, used, two, primary, strategies, for, the, approach, to, battle, his, manoeuvre, de, derri, re, move, onto, the, rear, was, intended, to, place, the, french, army, across, the, enemy, s, lines, of, communications, this, forced, the, opponent, to, either, march, to, battle, with, napoleon, or, attempt, to, find, an, escape, route, around, the, army, by, placing, his, army, into, the, rear, his, opponent, s, supplies, and, communications, would, be, cut, this, had, a, negative, effect, on, enemy, morale, once, joined, the, battle, would, be, one, in, which, his, opponent, could, not, afford, defeat, this, also, allowed, napoleon, to, select, multiple, battle, angles, into, a, battle, site, initially, the, lack, of, force, concentration, helped, with, foraging, for, food, and, sought, to, confuse, the, enemy, as, to, his, real, location, and, intentions, the, indirect, approach, into, battle, also, allowed, napoleon, to, disrupt, the, linear, formations, used, by, the, allied, armies, as, the, battle, progressed, the, enemy, committed, their, reserves, to, stabilize, the, situation, napoleon, would, suddenly, release, the, flanking, formation, to, attack, the, enemy, his, opponents, being, suddenly, confronted, with, a, new, threat, and, with, little, reserves, had, no, choice, but, to, weaken, the, area, closest, to, the, flanking, formation, and, draw, up, a, battle, line, at, a, right, angle, in, an, attempt, to, stop, this, new, threat, once, this, had, occurred, napoleon, would, mass, his, reserves, at, the, hinge, of, that, right, angle, and, launch, a, heavy, attack, to, break, the, lines, the, rupture, in, the, enemy, lines, allowed, napoleon, s, cavalry, to, flank, both, lines, and, roll, them, up, leaving, his, opponent, no, choice, but, to, surrender, or, flee, the, second, strategy, used, by, napoleon, i, of, france, when, confronted, with, two, or, more, enemy, armies, was, the, use, of, the, central, position, this, allowed, napoleon, to, drive, a, wedge, to, separate, the, enemy, armies, he, would, then, use, part, of, his, force, to, mask, one, army, while, the, larger, portion, overwhelmed, and, defeated, the, second, army, quickly, he, would, then, march, on, the, second, army, leaving, a, portion, to, pursue, the, first, army, and, repeat, the, operations, defeat, in, detail, this, was, designed, to, achieve, the, highest, concentration, of, men, into, the, primary, battle, while, limiting, the, enemy, s, ability, to, reinforce, the, critical, battle, the, central, position, did, have, a, weakness, in, that, the, full, power, of, the, pursuit, of, the, enemy, could, not, be, achieved, because, the, second, army, needed, attention, napoleon, used, the, central, position, strategy, during, the, battle, of, waterloo, napoleon, masked, wellington, and, massed, against, the, prussian, army, and, then, after, the, battle, of, ligny, was, won, napoleon, attempted, to, do, the, same, to, the, allied, british, army, located, just, to, the, south, of, waterloo, his, subordinate, was, unable, to, mask, the, defeated, prussian, army, who, reinforced, the, waterloo, battle, in, time, to, defeat, napoleon, and, end, his, domination, of, europe, it, can, be, said, that, the, prussian, army, under, bl, cher, used, the, maneuver, de, derri, re, against, napoleon, who, was, suddenly, placed, in, a, position, of, reacting, to, a, new, enemy, threat, napoleon, s, practical, strategic, triumphs, repeatedly, leading, smaller, forces, to, defeat, larger, ones, inspired, a, whole, new, field, of, study, into, military, strategy, in, particular, his, opponents, were, keen, to, develop, a, body, of, knowledge, in, this, area, to, allow, them, to, counteract, a, masterful, individual, with, a, highly, competent, group, of, officers, a, general, staff, the, two, most, significant, students, of, his, work, were, carl, von, clausewitz, a, prussian, with, a, background, in, philosophy, and, antoine, henri, jomini, who, had, been, one, of, napoleon, s, staff, officers, one, notable, exception, to, napoleon, s, strategy, of, annihilation, and, a, precursor, to, trench, warfare, were, the, lines, of, torres, vedras, during, the, peninsular, war, french, armies, lived, off, the, land, and, when, they, were, confronted, by, a, line, of, fortifications, which, they, could, not, out, flank, they, were, unable, to, continue, the, advance, and, were, forced, to, retreat, once, they, had, consumed, all, the, provisions, of, the, region, in, front, of, the, lines, the, peninsular, campaign, was, notable, for, the, development, of, another, method, of, warfare, which, went, largely, unnoticed, at, the, time, but, would, become, far, more, common, in, the, 20th, century, that, was, the, aid, and, encouragement, the, british, gave, to, the, spanish, to, harass, the, french, behind, their, lines, which, led, them, to, squander, most, of, the, assets, of, their, iberian, army, in, protecting, the, army, s, line, of, communications, this, was, a, very, cost, effective, move, for, the, british, because, it, cost, far, less, to, aid, spanish, insurgents, than, it, did, to, equip, and, pay, regular, british, army, units, to, engage, the, same, number, of, french, troops, as, the, british, army, could, be, correspondingly, smaller, it, was, able, to, supply, its, troops, by, sea, and, land, without, having, to, live, off, the, land, as, was, the, norm, at, the, time, further, because, they, did, not, have, to, forage, they, did, not, antagonise, the, locals, and, so, did, not, have, to, garrison, their, lines, of, communications, to, the, same, extent, as, the, french, did, so, the, strategy, of, aiding, their, spanish, civilian, allies, in, their, guerrilla, or, small, war, benefited, the, british, in, many, ways, not, all, of, which, were, immediately, obvious, clausewitz, s, on, war, has, become, a, respected, reference, for, strategy, dealing, with, political, as, well, as, military, leadership, his, most, famous, assertion, being, clausewitz, saw, war, first, and, foremost, as, a, political, act, and, thus, maintained, that, the, purpose, of, all, strategy, was, to, achieve, the, political, goal, that, the, state, was, seeking, to, accomplish, as, such, clausewitz, famously, argued, that, war, was, the, continuation, of, politics, by, other, means, and, as, such, suggested, that, the, amount, of, force, used, by, a, warring, state, would, and, should, be, proportional, to, whatever, political, aim, that, the, state, sought, to, achieve, via, war, clausewitz, further, dismissed, geometry, as, an, insignificant, factor, in, strategy, believing, instead, that, ideally, all, wars, should, follow, the, napoleonic, concept, of, victory, through, a, decisive, battle, of, annihilation, and, destruction, of, the, opposing, force, at, any, cost, however, he, also, recognized, that, his, ideal, of, how, war, should, be, fought, was, not, always, practical, in, reality, and, that, limited, warfare, could, influence, policy, by, wearing, down, the, opposition, through, a, strategy, of, attrition, in, contrast, to, clausewitz, antoine, henri, jomini, 1779, 1869, dealt, mainly, with, operational, strategy, planning, and, intelligence, the, conduct, of, a, campaign, and, generalship, rather, than, statesmanship, he, proposed, that, victory, could, be, achieved, by, occupying, the, enemy, s, territory, rather, than, destroying, a, opposing, army, as, such, geometric, considerations, were, prominent, in, jomini, s, theory, of, strategy, jomini, s, two, basic, principles, of, strategy, were, to, concentrate, against, fractions, of, the, enemy, force, at, a, time, and, to, strike, at, the, most, decisive, objective, clausewitz, and, jomini, remain, required, reading, for, today, s, military, professional, officer, the, evolution, of, military, strategy, continued, in, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, the, practice, of, strategy, was, advanced, by, generals, such, as, robert, e, lee, ulysses, s, grant, and, william, tecumseh, sherman, all, of, whom, had, been, influenced, by, the, feats, of, napoleon, thomas, stonewall, jackson, was, said, to, have, carried, a, book, of, napoleon, s, maxims, with, him, however, the, adherence, to, the, napoleonic, principles, in, the, face, of, technological, advances, such, as, the, long, range, infantry, breechloader, rifles, and, minie, ball, guns, generally, led, to, disastrous, consequences, for, both, the, union, and, confederate, forces, and, populace, the, time, and, space, in, which, war, was, waged, changed, as, well, railroads, enabled, swift, movement, of, large, forces, but, the, manoeuvring, was, constrained, to, narrow, vulnerable, corridors, steam, power, and, ironclads, changed, transport, and, combat, at, sea, newly, invented, telegraph, enabled, more, rapid, communication, between, armies, and, their, headquarters, capitals, combat, was, still, usually, waged, by, opposing, divisions, with, skirmish, lines, on, rural, battlefields, violent, naval, engagements, by, cannon, armed, sailing, or, steam, powered, vessels, and, assault, on, military, forces, defending, a, town, there, was, still, room, for, triumphs, for, the, strategy, of, manoeuvre, such, as, sherman, s, march, to, the, sea, in, 1864, but, these, depended, upon, an, enemy, s, unwillingness, to, entrench, towards, the, end, of, the, war, especially, in, defense, of, static, targets, as, in, the, battles, of, cold, harbor, and, vicksburg, trench, networks, foreshadowed, world, war, i, many, of, the, lessons, of, the, american, civil, war, were, forgotten, when, in, wars, like, the, austro, prussian, war, or, the, franco, prussian, war, manoeuvre, won, the, day, in, the, period, preceding, world, war, i, two, of, the, most, influential, strategists, were, the, prussian, generals, helmuth, von, moltke, and, alfred, von, schlieffen, under, moltke, the, prussian, army, achieved, victory, in, the, austro, prussian, war, 1866, and, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, 71, the, latter, campaign, being, widely, regarded, as, a, classic, example, of, the, conception, and, execution, of, military, strategy, in, addition, to, exploiting, railroads, and, highways, for, manoeuvre, moltke, also, exploited, the, telegraph, for, control, of, large, armies, he, recognised, the, need, to, delegate, control, to, subordinate, commanders, and, to, issue, directives, rather, than, specific, orders, moltke, is, most, remembered, as, a, strategist, for, his, belief, in, the, need, for, flexibility, and, that, no, plan, however, well, prepared, can, be, guaranteed, to, survive, beyond, the, first, encounter, with, the, enemy, field, marshal, schlieffen, succeeded, moltke, and, directed, german, planning, in, the, lead, up, to, world, war, i, he, advocated, the, strategy, of, annihilation, but, was, faced, by, a, war, on, two, fronts, against, numerically, superior, opposition, the, strategy, he, formulated, was, the, schlieffen, plan, defending, in, the, east, while, concentrating, for, a, decisive, victory, in, the, west, after, which, the, germans, would, go, on, to, the, offensive, in, the, east, influenced, by, hannibal, s, success, at, the, battle, of, cannae, schlieffen, planned, for, a, single, great, battle, of, encirclement, thereby, annihilating, his, enemy, another, german, strategist, of, the, period, was, hans, delbr, ck, who, expanded, on, clausewitz, s, concept, of, limited, warfare, to, produce, a, theory, on, the, strategy, of, exhaustion, his, theory, defied, popular, military, thinking, of, the, time, which, was, strongly, in, favour, of, victory, in, battle, yet, world, war, i, would, soon, demonstrate, the, flaws, of, a, mindless, strategy, of, annihilation, at, a, time, when, industrialisation, was, rapidly, changing, naval, technology, one, american, strategist, alfred, thayer, mahan, almost, single, handedly, brought, the, field, of, naval, strategy, up, to, date, influenced, by, jomini, s, principles, of, strategy, he, saw, that, in, the, coming, wars, where, economic, strategy, could, be, as, important, as, military, strategy, control, of, the, sea, granted, the, power, to, control, the, trade, and, resources, needed, to, wage, war, mahan, pushed, the, concept, of, the, big, navy, and, an, expansionist, view, where, defence, was, achieved, by, controlling, the, sea, approaches, rather, than, fortifying, the, coast, his, theories, contributed, to, the, naval, arms, race, between, 1898, and, 1914, at, the, start, of, world, war, i, strategy, was, dominated, by, the, offensive, thinking, that, had, been, in, vogue, since, 1870, despite, the, more, recent, experiences, of, the, second, boer, war, 1899, 1902, and, russo, japanese, war, 1904, 05, where, the, machine, gun, demonstrated, its, defensive, capabilities, by, the, end, of, 1914, the, western, front, was, a, stalemate, and, all, ability, to, maneuver, strategically, was, lost, the, combatants, resorted, to, a, strategy, of, attrition, the, german, battle, at, verdun, the, british, on, the, somme, and, at, passchendaele, were, among, the, first, wide, scale, battles, intended, to, wear, down, the, enemy, attrition, was, time, consuming, so, the, duration, of, world, war, i, battles, often, stretched, to, weeks, and, months, the, problem, with, attrition, was, that, the, use, of, fortified, defenses, in, depth, generally, required, a, ratio, of, ten, attackers, to, one, defender, or, a, level, of, artillery, support, which, was, simply, not, feasible, until, late, 1917, for, any, reasonable, chance, of, victory, the, ability, of, the, defender, to, move, troops, using, interior, lines, prevented, the, possibility, of, fully, exploiting, any, breakthrough, with, the, level, of, technology, then, attainable, perhaps, the, most, controversial, aspect, of, strategy, in, world, war, i, was, the, difference, among, the, british, between, the, western, viewpoint, held, by, field, marshal, haig, and, the, eastern, the, former, being, that, all, effort, should, be, directed, against, the, german, army, the, latter, that, more, useful, work, could, be, done, by, attacking, germany, s, allies, the, term, knocking, away, the, props, was, used, perhaps, as, a, consequence, of, the, fact, that, all, of, germany, s, allies, lay, south, of, i, e, beneath, it, on, the, map, proponents, of, the, western, viewpoint, make, the, point, that, germany, s, allies, were, more, than, once, rescued, from, disaster, or, rendered, capable, of, holding, their, own, or, making, substantial, gains, by, the, provision, of, german, troops, arms, or, military, advisers, whereas, those, allies, did, not, at, any, time, provide, a, similar, function, for, germany, that, is, it, was, germany, which, was, the, prop, and, its, allies, particularly, bulgaria, and, austria, hungary, did, not, suffer, significant, reverses, until, germany, s, ability, to, come, to, their, aid, was, grossly, impaired, on, other, fronts, there, was, still, room, for, the, use, of, strategy, of, maneuver, the, germans, executed, a, perfect, battle, of, annihilation, against, the, russians, at, the, battle, of, tannenberg, in, 1915, britain, and, france, launched, the, well, intentioned, but, poorly, conceived, and, ultimately, fruitless, dardanelles, campaign, combining, naval, power, and, an, amphibious, landing, in, an, effort, to, aid, their, russian, ally, and, knock, the, ottoman, empire, out, of, the, war, the, palestine, campaign, was, dominated, by, cavalry, which, flourished, in, the, local, terrain, and, the, british, achieved, two, breakthrough, victories, at, gaza, 1917, and, megiddo, 1918, colonel, t, e, lawrence, and, other, british, officers, led, arab, irregulars, on, a, guerrilla, campaign, against, the, ottomans, using, strategy, and, tactics, developed, during, the, boer, wars, world, war, i, saw, armies, on, a, scale, never, before, experienced, the, british, who, had, always, relied, on, a, strong, navy, and, a, small, regular, army, were, forced, to, undertake, a, rapid, expansion, of, the, army, this, outpaced, the, rate, of, training, of, generals, and, staff, officers, able, to, handle, such, a, mammoth, force, and, overwhelmed, the, ability, of, british, industry, to, equip, it, with, the, necessary, weapons, and, adequate, high, quality, munitions, until, late, in, the, war, technological, advances, also, had, a, huge, influence, on, strategy, aerial, reconnaissance, artillery, techniques, poison, gas, the, automobile, and, tank, though, the, latter, was, even, at, the, end, of, the, war, still, in, its, infancy, telephone, and, radio, telegraphy, more, so, than, in, previous, wars, military, strategy, in, world, war, i, was, directed, by, the, grand, strategy, of, a, coalition, of, nations, the, entente, on, one, side, and, the, central, powers, on, the, other, society, and, economy, were, mobilized, for, total, war, attacks, on, the, enemy, s, economy, included, britain, s, use, of, a, naval, blockade, and, germany, employing, submarine, warfare, against, merchant, shipping, unity, of, command, became, a, question, when, the, various, nation, states, began, coordinating, assaults, and, defenses, under, the, pressure, of, horrendously, destructive, german, attacks, beginning, on, march, 21, 1918, the, entente, eventually, settled, under, field, marshal, ferdinand, foch, the, germans, generally, led, the, central, powers, though, german, authority, diminished, and, lines, of, command, became, confused, at, the, end, of, the, war, world, war, i, strategy, was, dominated, by, the, spirit, of, the, offensive, where, generals, resorted, almost, to, mysticism, in, terms, of, a, soldier, s, personal, attitude, in, order, to, break, the, stalemate, this, led, to, nothing, but, bloody, slaughter, as, troops, in, close, ranks, charged, machine, guns, each, side, developed, an, alternate, thesis, the, british, under, winston, churchill, developed, tank, warfare, with, which, they, eventually, won, the, war, the, germans, developed, a, doctrine, of, autonomy, the, forerunner, of, both, blitzkrieg, and, modern, infantry, tactics, using, groups, of, stormtroopers, who, would, advance, in, small, mutually, covering, groups, from, cover, to, cover, with, autonomy, to, exploit, any, weakness, they, discovered, in, enemy, defenses, almost, all, the, blitzkrieg, commanders, of, world, war, ii, particularly, erwin, rommel, were, stormtroopers, in, world, war, i, after, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, germany, launched, and, almost, succeeded, in, a, final, offensive, however, the, new, tactics, of, autonomy, revealed, a, weakness, in, terms, of, overall, coordination, and, direction, the, march, offensive, intended, to, drive, a, wedge, between, the, french, and, british, armies, turn, on, the, latter, and, destroy, it, lost, direction, and, became, driven, by, its, territorial, gains, its, original, purpose, neglected, world, war, i, ended, when, the, ability, of, the, german, army, to, fight, became, so, diminished, that, germany, asked, for, peace, conditions, the, german, military, exhausted, by, the, efforts, of, the, march, offensives, and, dispirited, by, their, failure, was, first, seriously, defeated, during, the, battle, of, amiens, 8, 11, august, 1918, and, the, german, homefront, entered, general, revolt, over, a, lack, of, food, and, destruction, of, the, economy, victory, for, the, entente, was, almost, assured, by, that, point, and, the, fact, of, germany, s, military, impotence, was, driven, home, in, the, following, hundred, days, in, this, time, the, entente, reversed, the, gains, the, germans, had, made, in, the, first, part, of, the, year, and, the, british, army, spearheaded, by, the, canadians, and, australians, finally, broke, the, hindenburg, defensive, system, though, his, methods, are, questioned, britain, s, field, marshal, haig, was, ultimately, proved, correct, in, his, grand, strategic, vision, we, cannot, hope, to, win, until, we, have, defeated, the, german, army, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, best, german, troops, were, dead, and, the, remainder, were, under, continuous, pressure, on, all, parts, of, the, western, front, a, consequence, in, part, of, an, almost, endless, supply, of, fresh, american, reinforcements, which, the, germans, were, unable, to, match, and, in, part, of, industry, at, last, supplying, the, weakened, entente, armies, with, the, firepower, to, replace, the, men, they, lacked, while, germany, wanted, for, all, sorts, of, materials, thanks, to, the, naval, blockade, interior, lines, thus, became, meaningless, as, germany, had, nothing, more, to, offer, its, allies, the, props, eventually, fell, but, only, because, they, were, themselves, no, longer, supported, the, role, of, the, tank, in, world, war, i, strategy, is, often, poorly, understood, its, supporters, saw, it, as, the, weapon, of, victory, and, many, observers, since, have, accused, the, high, commands, especially, the, british, of, shortsightedness, in, this, matter, particularly, in, view, of, what, tanks, have, achieved, since, nevertheless, the, world, war, i, tank, s, limitations, imposed, by, the, limits, of, contemporary, engineering, technology, have, to, be, borne, in, mind, they, were, slow, men, could, run, and, frequently, walk, faster, vulnerable, to, artillery, due, to, their, size, clumsiness, and, inability, to, carry, armour, against, anything, but, rifle, and, machine, gun, ammunition, extremely, uncomfortable, conditions, inside, them, often, incapacitating, crews, with, engine, fumes, and, heat, and, driving, some, mad, with, noise, and, often, despicably, unreliable, frequently, failing, to, make, it, to, their, targets, due, to, engine, or, track, failures, this, was, the, factor, behind, the, seemingly, mindless, retention, of, large, bodies, of, cavalry, which, even, in, 1918, with, armies, incompletely, mechanised, were, still, the, only, armed, force, capable, of, moving, significantly, faster, than, an, infantryman, on, foot, it, was, not, until, the, relevant, technology, in, engineering, and, communications, matured, between, the, wars, that, the, tank, and, the, airplane, could, be, forged, into, the, co, ordinated, force, needed, to, truly, restore, manoeuvre, to, warfare, in, the, years, following, world, war, i, two, of, the, technologies, that, had, been, introduced, during, that, conflict, the, aircraft, and, the, tank, became, the, subject, of, strategic, study, the, leading, theorist, of, air, power, was, italian, general, giulio, douhet, who, believed, that, future, wars, would, be, won, or, lost, in, the, air, the, air, force, would, carry, the, offensive, and, the, role, of, the, ground, forces, would, be, defensive, only, douhet, s, doctrine, of, strategic, bombing, meant, striking, at, the, enemy, s, heartland, his, cities, industry, and, communications, air, power, would, thereby, reduce, his, willingness, and, capacity, to, fight, at, this, time, the, idea, of, the, aircraft, carrier, and, its, capabilities, also, started, to, change, thinking, in, those, countries, with, large, fleets, but, nowhere, as, much, as, in, japan, the, uk, and, us, seem, to, have, seen, the, carrier, as, a, defensive, weapon, and, their, designs, mirrored, this, the, japanese, imperial, navy, seem, to, have, developed, a, new, offensive, strategy, based, on, the, power, projection, these, made, possible, british, general, j, f, c, fuller, architect, of, the, first, great, tank, battle, at, cambrai, and, his, contemporary, b, h, liddell, hart, were, amongst, the, most, prominent, advocates, of, mechanization, and, motorization, of, the, army, in, britain, in, germany, study, groups, were, set, up, by, hans, von, seeckt, commander, of, the, reichswehr, truppenamt, for, 57, areas, of, strategy, and, tactics, to, learn, from, world, war, i, and, to, adapt, strategy, to, avoid, the, stalemate, and, then, defeat, they, had, suffered, all, seem, to, have, seen, the, strategic, shock, value, of, mobility, and, the, new, possibilities, made, possible, by, motorised, forces, both, saw, that, the, armoured, fighting, vehicle, demonstrated, firepower, mobility, and, protection, the, germans, seem, to, have, seen, more, clearly, the, need, to, make, all, branches, of, the, army, as, mobile, as, possible, to, maximise, the, results, of, this, strategy, it, would, negate, the, static, defences, of, the, trench, and, machine, gun, and, restore, the, strategic, principles, of, manoeuvre, and, offense, the, innovative, german, major, later, general, heinz, guderian, developed, the, motorised, part, of, this, strategy, as, the, head, of, one, of, the, truppenamt, groups, and, may, have, incorporated, fuller, s, and, liddell, hart, s, ideas, to, amplify, the, groundbreaking, blitzkrieg, effect, that, was, seen, used, by, germany, against, poland, in, 1939, and, later, against, france, in, 1940, france, still, committed, to, stationary, world, war, i, strategies, was, completely, surprised, and, summarily, overwhelmed, by, germany, s, mobile, combined, arms, doctrine, and, guderian, s, panzer, corps, technological, change, had, an, enormous, effect, on, strategy, but, little, effect, on, leadership, the, use, of, telegraph, and, later, radio, along, with, improved, transport, enabled, the, rapid, movement, of, large, numbers, of, men, one, of, germany, s, key, enablers, in, mobile, warfare, was, the, use, of, radios, where, these, were, put, into, every, tank, however, the, number, of, men, that, one, officer, could, effectively, control, had, if, anything, declined, the, increases, in, the, size, of, the, armies, led, to, an, increase, in, the, number, of, officers, although, the, officer, ranks, in, the, us, army, did, swell, in, the, german, army, the, ratio, of, officers, to, total, men, remained, steady, inter, war, germany, had, as, its, main, strategic, goals, the, re, establishment, of, germany, as, a, european, great, power, and, the, complete, annulment, of, the, versailles, treaty, of, 1919, after, adolf, hitler, and, the, nazi, party, took, power, in, 1933, germany, s, political, goals, also, included, the, accumulation, of, lebensraum, living, space, for, the, germanic, race, and, the, elimination, of, communism, as, a, political, rival, to, nazism, the, destruction, of, european, jewry, while, not, strictly, a, strategic, objective, was, a, political, goal, of, the, nazi, regime, linked, to, the, vision, of, a, german, dominated, europe, and, especially, to, the, generalplan, ost, for, a, depopulated, east, which, germany, could, colonize, until, the, mid, 1930s, germany, s, ability, to, realize, these, goals, was, limited, by, its, weakened, military, and, economic, position, hitler, s, strategy, involved, building, up, german, military, and, economic, strength, through, re, armament, while, seeking, to, avoid, an, early, war, by, diplomatic, engagement, with, france, britain, and, later, the, soviet, union, stalin, hitler, pact, of, august, 1939, one, by, one, hitler, successfully, repudiated, the, terms, the, versailles, treaty, using, skilful, diplomacy, to, avoid, triggering, war, after, starting, open, re, armament, in, 1935, he, carried, out, the, re, occupation, of, the, rhineland, in, 1936, and, then, the, diplomatic, annexation, of, austria, anschluss, and, of, czechoslovakia, in, 1938, and, 1939, munich, agreement, september, 1938, this, risky, political, strategy, proved, initially, successful, consolidating, internal, support, for, the, nazi, regime, and, greatly, strengthening, germany, s, strategic, position, but, the, march, 1939, annexation, of, rump, czechoslovakia, in, violation, of, the, munich, agreement, signed, only, months, before, forced, a, change, in, franco, british, policy, from, an, emphasis, on, avoiding, war, appeasement, to, an, emphasis, on, war, preparation, of, which, an, important, feature, was, the, declaration, of, franco, british, guarantees, of, polish, independence, when, germany, invaded, poland, in, september, 1939, britain, and, france, declared, war, 3, september, 1939, hitler, s, strategy, for, war, was, laid, out, in, mein, kampf, 1925, 1926, whether, hitler, intended, global, or, merely, european, conquest, or, whether, he, even, had, a, plan, for, war, in, advance, is, debated, see, nazi, foreign, policy, historiographic, debate, in, mein, kampf, hitler, had, imagined, a, short, war, against, france, and, then, the, conquest, of, the, ussr, he, had, wrongly, assumed, that, britain, would, be, a, german, ally, in, the, west, against, france, and, so, he, did, not, foresee, an, enduring, war, in, the, west, once, the, second, world, war, had, begun, with, france, and, britain, as, allies, german, strategy, aimed, to, win, a, short, war, in, france, and, to, force, britain, to, the, negotiating, table, after, the, conquest, of, france, in, may, june, 1940, churchill, s, refusal, to, surrender, or, to, negotiate, on, terms, favorable, for, germany, put, the, german, gamble, in, jeopardy, germany, could, not, match, britain, on, the, open, sea, and, had, not, prepared, its, army, for, operations, across, the, channel, instead, the, wehrmacht, hoped, to, strangle, britain, s, economy, through, success, in, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, 1939, 1945, and, the, battle, of, britain, 1940, in, june, 1941, germany, invaded, the, ussr, operation, barbarossa, to, carry, out, the, second, part, of, hitler, s, strategy, the, campaign, plan, envisaged, defeating, the, ussr, in, a, single, summer, fall, campaign, but, barbarossa, failed, to, achieve, any, of, its, major, objectives, in, december, 1941, japan, attacked, the, usa, and, germany, declared, war, on, the, usa, shortly, afterwards, through, the, summer, and, fall, of, 1942, german, strategy, to, win, the, war, remained, based, on, defeating, the, ussr, since, the, entente, cordiale, which, had, won, the, first, world, war, britain, s, strategy, for, continental, war, was, based, on, alliance, with, france, and, later, unsuccessful, efforts, to, engage, fascist, italy, and, the, ussr, in, an, effort, to, contain, germany, confronted, with, the, rise, of, hitler, s, power, on, the, continent, in, 1933, and, weakened, economically, by, the, great, depression, great, britain, sought, initially, to, avoid, or, delay, war, through, diplomacy, appeasement, while, at, the, same, time, re, arming, neville, chamberlain, s, european, policy, emphasis, for, re, armament, was, given, to, air, forces, with, the, view, that, these, would, be, most, useful, in, any, future, war, with, germany, by, 1939, allied, efforts, to, avert, war, had, failed, and, germany, had, signed, alliances, with, both, italy, pact, of, steel, and, the, ussr, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, in, august, 1939, in, a, final, effort, to, contain, germany, britain, and, france, guaranteed, polish, independence, anglo, polish, military, alliance, upon, the, outbreak, of, war, in, september, 1939, british, rearmament, was, not, yet, complete, although, the, royal, air, force, had, been, greatly, expanded, and, programmes, for, new, aircraft, and, equipment, such, as, radar, defences, were, just, coming, to, fruition, britain, remained, incapable, of, offensive, operations, except, for, strategic, bombing, and, this, was, relatively, ineffective, in, the, early, war, after, the, fall, of, france, in, mid, 1940, and, italian, entry, into, the, war, on, the, axis, side, britain, and, its, commonwealth, allies, found, themselves, alone, against, most, of, europe, british, strategy, was, one, of, survival, defending, the, british, isles, directly, in, the, battle, of, britain, and, indirectly, by, defeating, germany, in, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, and, the, combined, axis, powers, in, the, north, african, campaign, through, this, period, and, until, the, german, invasion, of, the, ussr, in, june, 1941, there, was, no, possibility, of, britain, winning, the, war, alone, and, so, british, grand, strategy, aimed, to, bring, the, usa, into, the, war, on, the, allied, side, prime, minister, churchill, devoted, much, of, his, diplomatic, efforts, to, this, goal, in, august, 1941, at, the, atlantic, conference, he, met, us, president, roosevelt, in, the, first, of, many, wartime, meetings, wherein, allied, war, strategy, was, jointly, decided, in, december, 1941, following, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, united, states, entered, the, war, britain, was, now, also, at, war, with, imperial, japan, whose, forces, inflicted, rapid, defeats, on, british, forces, in, asia, capturing, hong, kong, malaya, singapore, and, burma, nevertheless, churchill, expressed, the, view, that, with, the, entry, of, the, usa, into, the, war, ultimate, victory, was, assured, for, the, allies, all, the, rest, was, merely, the, proper, application, of, overwhelming, force, from, this, point, onward, the, strategy, of, the, allies, other, than, the, ussr, is, better, addressed, as, joint, allied, strategy, in, the, december, 1941, at, the, arcadia, conference, the, allied, leaders, agreed, to, the, germany, first, principle, whereby, germany, was, to, be, defeated, first, and, then, japan, however, allied, land, forces, would, not, be, capable, of, invading, the, mainland, of, europe, for, years, even, as, joseph, stalin, pressed, for, the, western, allies, to, alleviate, pressure, on, the, eastern, front, supporting, the, soviet, war, effort, was, a, significant, element, of, allied, strategy, and, significant, aid, was, shipped, to, the, ussr, through, the, lend, lease, programme, strategic, warfare, and, especially, strategic, bombing, was, a, supporting, component, of, allied, strategy, through, 1942, and, 1943, the, allies, gradually, won, the, war, at, sea, and, in, the, air, blockading, germany, and, subjecting, it, to, a, strategic, bombing, campaign, of, increasing, effectiveness, strategic, bombing, during, world, war, ii, in, january, 1943, at, the, casablanca, conference, the, allies, agreed, to, demand, axis, unconditional, surrender, a, war, aim, which, implied, the, physical, occupation, of, germany, with, land, forces, while, building, up, strength, for, an, invasion, of, continental, europe, the, allies, pursued, an, indirect, strategy, by, invading, europe, from, the, south, after, defeating, axis, forces, in, north, africa, the, invasion, of, french, north, africa, sicily, and, southern, italy, were, invaded, leading, to, the, defeat, of, fascist, italy, churchill, especially, favoured, a, southern, strategy, aiming, to, attack, the, soft, underbelly, of, axis, europe, through, italy, greece, and, the, balkans, in, a, strategy, similar, to, the, first, world, war, idea, of, knocking, out, the, supports, roosevelt, favoured, a, more, direct, approach, through, northern, europe, and, with, the, invasion, of, normandy, in, june, 1944, the, weight, of, allied, effort, shifted, to, the, direct, conquest, of, germany, from, 1944, as, german, defeat, became, more, and, more, inevitable, the, shape, of, post, war, europe, assumed, greater, importance, in, allied, strategy, at, the, second, quebec, conference, in, september, 1944, the, allies, agreed, to, partition, and, de, industrialize, a, defeated, germany, so, as, to, render, it, permanently, unable, to, wage, war, see, morgenthau, plan, after, the, war, this, plan, was, abandoned, as, unworkable, at, the, tehran, conference, allied, strategy, adopted, its, final, major, component, with, the, acceptance, of, soviet, conditions, for, a, sphere, of, influence, in, eastern, europe, to, include, eastern, germany, and, berlin, early, soviet, strategy, aimed, to, avoid, or, delay, war, while, developing, the, central, government, s, hold, over, the, state, and, expanding, the, industrial, base, soviet, economy, and, military, was, weak, but, rapidly, expanding, in, an, intense, industrialization, process, the, ussr, had, been, overtly, hostile, to, nazi, germany, for, most, of, the, pre, war, period, but, the, failure, of, appeasement, convinced, stalin, that, the, allies, were, actively, seeking, a, nazi, soviet, war, the, soviet, government, doubted, that, a, war, against, germany, could, be, avoided, however, negotiations, were, continued, in, order, to, at, the, very, least, buy, time, and, permit, the, soviets, to, secure, the, soviet, german, border, through, expansion, and, pressure, on, strategically, important, states, perceived, as, possible, german, allies, in, a, future, war, the, signing, of, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, gave, the, ussr, freedom, to, in, its, view, preempt, hostile, action, from, nations, along, its, western, border, the, invasion, in, the, barbarossa, campaign, of, 1941, came, earlier, than, expected, to, the, soviet, leadership, resulting, in, the, catastrophic, loss, of, over, 4, million, soviet, soldiers, killed, or, captured, nevertheless, the, ussr, managed, to, halt, the, german, advance, at, the, outskirts, of, moscow, and, leningrad, with, spies, providing, the, certain, knowledge, that, japanese, forces, in, the, far, east, would, not, attack, siberia, the, soviets, were, able, to, transfer, large, numbers, of, experienced, forces, from, the, far, east, and, in, the, winter, of, 1941, 1942, they, used, them, to, counter, attack, the, german, army, group, centre, in, front, of, moscow, as, the, army, was, being, defeated, and, giving, up, ground, in, the, initial, assault, a, gigantic, operation, was, staged, to, move, economic, capacity, from, the, western, areas, that, were, about, to, be, overrun, to, eastern, regions, in, the, urals, and, central, asia, that, were, out, of, reach, of, the, germans, entire, factories, including, their, labour, force, were, simply, moved, and, what, couldn, t, be, taken, was, destroyed, scorched, earth, as, a, result, even, though, huge, territories, were, captured, by, the, germans, the, production, potential, of, the, soviet, economy, was, not, correspondingly, harmed, and, the, factories, shifted, to, mass, production, of, military, equipment, quickly, even, before, the, war, soviet, industrialization, had, brought, soviet, gdp, to, a, level, roughly, equivalent, to, germany, although, a, significant, part, of, the, urban, population, had, been, captured, by, germany, in, the, 1941, campaign, the, soviet, economy, immediately, went, to, a, total, war, footing, and, was, soon, outproducing, the, german, economy, in, war, materiel, it, quickly, became, apparent, that, the, war, in, the, east, would, be, pitiless, and, total, soviet, strategy, was, therefore, aimed, at, preserving, the, state, at, whatever, cost, and, then, the, ultimate, defeat, and, conquest, of, germany, this, strategy, was, successful, by, 1943, the, ussr, was, confident, in, final, victory, and, new, aim, of, soviet, strategy, became, securing, a, favourable, post, war, europe, at, the, tehran, conference, of, 1943, stalin, secured, acquiescence, to, a, soviet, sphere, in, influence, from, his, western, allies, japanese, world, war, ii, strategy, was, driven, by, two, factors, the, desire, to, expand, their, territories, on, the, mainland, of, asia, china, and, manchuria, and, the, need, to, secure, the, supply, of, raw, resources, they, didn, t, have, themselves, particularly, oil, since, their, quest, after, the, former, conquest, of, chinese, provinces, endangered, the, latter, an, oil, boycott, by, the, us, and, its, allies, the, japanese, government, saw, no, other, option, than, to, conquer, the, oil, sources, in, south, east, asia, since, these, were, controlled, by, american, allies, war, with, the, usa, was, seen, as, inevitable, thus, japanese, leaders, decided, it, would, be, best, to, deal, a, severe, blow, to, the, u, s, first, this, was, executed, in, the, pearl, harbor, strike, crippling, the, american, battle, fleet, japan, hoped, it, would, take, america, so, long, to, rebuild, by, the, time, she, was, able, to, return, in, force, in, the, pacific, she, would, consider, the, new, balance, of, power, a, fait, accompli, and, negotiate, a, peace, however, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, failed, to, destroy, the, crucial, targets, aircraft, carriers, and, most, crucially, for, japan, s, ability, to, hold, island, bases, submarines, and, ignored, others, oil, tank, farms, power, station, thus, the, u, s, navy, was, not, weakened, enough, to, force, withdrawal, the, psychological, effect, also, caused, the, u, s, population, and, armed, forces, to, fully, mobilize, for, war, south, east, asia, was, quickly, conquered, philippines, indochina, malaysia, and, the, dutch, east, indies, after, japan, s, vital, aircraft, carrier, force, was, destroyed, in, the, battle, of, midway, the, japanese, had, to, revert, to, a, stiff, defense, they, kept, up, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, with, both, japan, and, the, us, fighting, two, front, wars, against, each, other, in, the, pacific, and, additionally, the, us, in, europe, and, the, japanese, in, china, the, far, greater, american, economic, power, enabled, the, us, forces, to, replace, battle, losses, considerably, faster, and, to, eventually, outgun, the, japanese, in, several, aircraft, carrier, battles, the, initiative, was, taken, from, the, japanese, and, after, the, battle, of, midway, the, japanese, navy, was, rendered, helpless, effectively, giving, the, americans, vast, naval, superiority, after, the, japanese, were, forced, into, the, defensive, in, the, second, half, of, 1942, the, americans, were, confronted, with, heavily, fortified, garrisons, on, small, islands, they, decided, on, a, strategy, of, island, hopping, leaving, the, strongest, garrisons, alone, just, cutting, off, their, supply, via, naval, blockades, and, bombardment, and, securing, bases, of, operation, on, the, lightly, defended, islands, instead, the, most, notable, of, these, island, battles, was, the, battle, of, iwo, jima, where, the, american, victory, paved, the, way, for, the, aerial, bombing, of, the, japanese, mainland, which, culminated, in, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, and, the, bombing, of, tokyo, that, forced, japan, to, surrender, australia, s, historical, ties, with, britain, meant, that, with, the, commencement, of, world, war, ii, its, armies, were, sent, overseas, to, contribute, to, battles, in, europe, fear, from, the, north, was, so, understated, that, at, the, outbreak, of, open, warfare, with, japan, australia, itself, was, extremely, vulnerable, to, invasion, possible, invasion, plans, were, considered, by, the, japanese, high, command, though, there, was, strong, opposition, australia, s, policy, became, based, entirely, on, domestic, defense, following, the, attacks, on, pearl, harbor, and, british, assets, in, the, south, pacific, defying, strong, british, opposition, australian, prime, minister, john, curtin, recalled, most, troops, from, the, european, conflict, for, the, defense, of, the, nation, australia, s, defensive, doctrine, saw, a, fierce, campaign, fought, along, the, kokoda, track, in, new, guinea, this, campaign, sought, to, further, stretch, japanese, supply, lines, preventing, the, invasion, of, the, australian, mainland, until, the, arrival, of, fresh, american, troops, and, the, return, of, seasoned, australian, soldiers, from, europe, this, can, be, seen, as, a, variant, of, the, war, of, attrition, strategy, where, the, defender, out, of, necessity, had, to, hold, the, aggressor, at, a, semi, static, defensive, line, rather, than, falling, back, in, the, face, of, superior, numbers, this, method, is, in, stark, contrast, to, the, russian, scorched, earth, policy, against, napoleon, in, 1812, where, the, defenders, yielded, home, territory, in, favour, of, avoiding, open, battle, in, both, cases, the, lack, of, supplies, was, successful, in, blunting, the, assaults, following, exhaustive, defensive, efforts, the, chinese, communist, leader, mao, zedong, developed, a, military, strategy, called, people, s, war, it, aimed, at, creating, and, maintaining, support, of, the, local, population, and, draw, the, enemy, deep, into, the, interior, where, the, force, adopting, the, strategy, would, exhaust, them, through, a, mix, of, guerrilla, and, conventional, warfare, the, strategy, was, first, used, by, the, communists, against, the, forces, of, the, nationalist, government, led, by, chiang, kai, shek, in, the, chinese, civil, war, in, the, 1930s, during, and, after, the, arduous, long, march, the, communist, forces, who, were, dramatically, reduced, by, physical, exhaustion, disease, and, warfare, were, in, danger, of, destruction, by, the, pursuing, nationalist, forces, mao, then, convinced, other, high, ranking, political, officers, in, the, party, to, acquire, the, support, of, the, local, population, whilst, fighting, their, way, northwards, from, the, nationalist, forces, shortly, thereafter, he, formulated, the, concept, of, people, s, war, promising, land, reform, programs, to, the, local, populace, and, execution, of, the, local, landlords, in, the, areas, the, communists, control, using, this, strategy, not, only, prevented, the, communist, leadership, from, collapsing, but, also, raised, popular, support, across, china, which, eventually, allowed, them, to, take, total, control, over, the, chinese, mainland, the, people, s, war, is, not, only, a, military, strategy, but, also, a, political, one, in, its, original, formulation, by, mao, zedong, people, s, war, exploits, the, few, advantages, that, a, small, revolutionary, movement, has, against, a, government, s, power, including, a, large, and, well, equipped, army, people, s, war, strategically, avoids, decisive, battles, since, their, tiny, military, force, would, easily, be, routed, in, an, all, out, confrontation, with, the, government, s, army, instead, it, favours, a, three, stage, strategy, of, protracted, warfare, engaging, only, in, carefully, chosen, battles, that, can, realistically, be, won, relying, on, the, local, population, and, using, small, military, units, ensures, that, there, are, few, problems, concerning, logistics, and, supplies, in, stage, one, the, revolutionary, force, sets, up, in, a, remote, area, with, mountainous, or, forested, terrain, where, its, enemy, is, weak, and, attempts, to, establish, a, local, stronghold, known, as, a, revolutionary, base, area, as, it, grows, in, power, it, enters, stage, two, establishes, other, revolutionary, base, areas, where, it, may, exercise, governing, power, and, gain, popular, support, through, political, programmes, such, as, land, reform, eventually, in, stage, three, the, movement, has, enough, strength, to, encircle, and, capture, cities, of, increasing, size, until, finally, it, seizes, power, in, the, entire, country, within, the, chinese, red, army, later, to, be, called, as, the, people, s, liberation, army, the, concept, of, people, s, war, was, the, basis, of, strategy, against, the, japanese, and, nationalist, forces, and, also, against, a, hypothetical, russian, invasion, of, china, the, concept, of, people, s, war, became, less, important, with, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, increasing, possibility, of, conflict, with, the, united, states, over, taiwan, the, strategy, was, utilized, in, the, early, 1950s, by, the, hastily, formed, people, s, volunteer, army, during, the, korean, war, to, garner, support, from, the, local, korean, populace, to, win, the, war, by, driving, the, united, nations, forces, from, the, peninsula, at, the, battles, of, chongchon, river, valley, and, lake, changjin, the, army, employed, guerrilla, tactics, in, full, scale, following, the, people, s, war, doctrine, however, as, they, marched, towards, the, south, under, mao, s, stern, orders, after, their, decisive, victories, in, northern, korea, they, were, met, by, an, indifferent, and, sometimes, hostile, southern, population, who, despite, intimidation, were, not, willing, to, help, them, this, prevented, them, from, defeating, the, un, forces, in, korea, and, after, their, hard, fought, victory, at, the, third, battle, of, seoul, they, were, beaten, in, the, open, by, un, forces, in, the, conclusion, of, their, third, phase, campaign, later, on, the, war, turned, into, a, stalemated, two, year, confrontation, between, the, opposing, forces, thus, years, after, the, war, the, chinese, government, began, a, series, of, army, modernization, and, professionalization, that, would, radically, change, the, concept, of, the, strategy, and, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, concept, of, people, s, war, was, changed, to, include, more, high, technology, weaponry, the, people, s, war, strategy, was, also, employed, in, countries, around, the, world, such, as, cuba, nicaragua, nepal, philippines, the, united, kingdom, where, the, ira, was, in, rebellion, in, northern, ireland, and, applied, this, strategy, to, urban, warfare, and, elsewhere, the, people, s, war, in, the, first, three, countries, mentioned, have, been, spectacularly, successful, marking, government, transitions, in, these, countries, while, elsewhere, such, as, in, peru, it, has, been, unsuccessful, the, people, s, war, in, the, philippines, that, was, long, since, employed, by, the, insurgent, new, people, s, army, however, made, the, communist, insurgency, there, the, longest, in, world, history, in, india, and, turkey, there, are, still, ongoing, insurgencies, where, the, rebels, use, this, strategy, the, strategy, of, the, cold, war, was, that, of, containment, and, it, was, a, generation, dominated, by, the, threat, of, total, world, annihilation, through, the, use, of, nuclear, weapons, deterrence, was, a, part, of, containment, via, retributive, intimidation, from, the, risk, of, mutually, assured, destruction, as, a, consequence, it, was, also, a, war, in, which, attacks, were, not, exchanged, between, the, two, main, rivals, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, instead, the, war, was, fought, through, proxies, instead, of, mainly, being, confined, to, europe, or, the, pacific, the, entire, world, was, the, battlefield, with, countries, rather, than, armies, acting, as, main, players, the, only, constant, rule, was, that, troops, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, could, not, overtly, fight, with, each, other, military, strategy, involved, bipolar, powers, with, global, actors, who, could, strike, an, opponent, with, nationally, debilitating, destruction, in, a, matter, of, minutes, from, land, air, and, sea, with, the, advent, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, that, could, decide, a, war, by, themselves, strategies, shifted, away, from, a, focus, on, the, application, of, conventional, weaponry, to, a, greater, focus, on, espionage, and, intelligence, assessment, especially, after, the, exposure, of, the, atomic, spies, the, difference, between, tactics, strategy, and, grand, strategy, began, to, melt, during, the, cold, war, as, command, and, communication, technologies, improved, to, a, greater, extent, in, first, world, armed, forces, the, third, world, armed, forces, controlled, by, the, two, superpowers, found, that, grand, strategy, strategy, and, tactics, if, anything, moved, further, apart, as, the, command, of, the, armies, fell, under, the, control, of, super, power, leaders, american, cold, warriors, like, dean, acheson, and, george, c, marshall, quickly, recognized, that, the, key, to, victory, was, the, economic, defeat, of, the, soviet, union, the, soviet, union, had, adopted, an, aggressive, posture, of, communist, expansionism, following, the, end, of, world, war, ii, with, the, united, states, and, its, strong, navy, quickly, finding, that, it, had, to, aggressively, defend, much, of, the, world, from, the, soviet, union, and, the, spread, of, communism, strategies, during, the, cold, war, also, dealt, with, nuclear, attack, and, retaliation, the, united, states, and, nato, maintained, a, policy, of, limited, first, strike, throughout, the, cold, war, in, the, event, of, a, soviet, attack, on, the, western, front, resulting, in, a, breakthrough, the, united, states, would, use, tactical, nuclear, weapons, to, stop, the, attack, the, soviet, union, would, respond, with, an, all, out, nuclear, attack, resulting, in, a, similar, attack, from, the, united, states, with, all, the, consequences, the, exchange, would, entail, by, contrast, soviet, strategy, in, the, cold, war, was, dominated, by, the, desire, to, prevent, at, all, costs, the, recurrence, of, an, invasion, of, russian, soil, the, soviet, union, nominally, adopted, a, policy, of, no, first, use, which, in, fact, was, a, posture, of, launch, on, warning, other, than, that, the, ussr, adapted, to, some, degree, to, the, prevailing, changes, in, the, nato, strategic, policies, that, are, divided, by, periods, as, the, all, out, nuclear, world, war, iii, between, nato, and, the, warsaw, pact, did, not, take, place, the, united, states, recently, april, 2010, acknowledged, a, new, approach, to, its, nuclear, policy, which, describes, the, weapons, purpose, as, primarily, or, fundamentally, to, deter, or, respond, to, a, nuclear, attack, strategy, in, the, post, cold, war, is, shaped, by, the, global, geopolitical, situation, a, number, of, potent, powers, in, a, multipolar, array, which, has, arguably, come, to, be, dominated, by, the, hyperpower, status, of, the, united, states, which, increasingly, relies, on, advanced, technology, to, minimize, casualties, and, to, improve, efficiency, the, technological, leaps, brought, by, the, digital, revolution, are, essential, for, the, u, s, strategy, the, gap, in, strategy, today, from, a, western, viewpoint, lies, in, what, americans, call, asymmetric, warfare, the, battle, against, guerrilla, forces, by, conventional, national, armed, forces, the, classical, strategic, triumvirate, of, politics, military, populace, is, very, weak, against, protracted, warfare, of, paramilitary, forces, such, as, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, hezbollah, eta, the, kurdistan, workers, party, pkk, and, al, qaeda, the, ability, of, conventional, forces, to, deliver, utility, effect, from, their, hugely, powerful, forces, is, largely, nullified, by, the, difficulties, of, distinguishing, and, separating, combatants, from, the, civilian, populace, in, whose, company, they, hide, the, use, of, the, military, by, the, politicians, to, police, areas, seen, as, bases, for, these, guerrillas, leads, to, them, becoming, targets, themselves, which, eventually, undermines, the, support, of, the, populace, from, whom, they, come, and, whose, values, they, represent, parties, to, conflict, which, see, themselves, as, vastly, or, temporarily, inferior, may, adopt, a, strategy, of, hunkering, down, witness, iraq, in, 1991, or, yugoslavia, in, 1999, the, primary, effect, of, insurgent, elements, upon, conventional, force, strategy, is, realized, in, the, twofold, exploitation, of, the, inherent, violence, of, military, operations, conventional, armies, face, political, attrition, for, each, action, they, take, insurgent, forces, can, cause, harm, and, create, chaos, whereby, the, conventional, army, suffers, a, loss, of, confidence, and, esteem, or, they, can, drive, the, conventional, elements, into, an, attack, which, further, exacerbates, the, civilian, condition, the, major, militaries, of, today, are, largely, set, up, to, fight, the, last, war, previous, war, and, hence, have, huge, armoured, and, conventionally, configured, infantry, formations, backed, up, by, air, forces, and, navies, designed, to, support, or, prepare, for, these, forces, many, are, today, deployed, against, guerrilla, style, opponents, where, their, strengths, cannot, be, used, to, effect, the, mass, formations, of, industrial, warfare, are, often, seen, as, much, less, effective, than, the, unconventional, forces, that, modern, militaries, may, also, possess, the, new, opponents, operate, at, a, local, level, whereas, industrial, armed, forces, work, at, a, much, higher, theatre, level, the, nervous, system, of, these, new, opponents, is, largely, political, rather, than, military, hierarchical, and, adapted, to, the, local, supporting, populace, who, hide, them, the, centre, provides, the, political, idea, and, driving, logic, perhaps, with, overall, direction, and, some, funding, local, groups, decide, their, own, plans, raise, much, of, their, own, funding, and, may, be, more, or, less, aligned, to, the, centre, s, aims, defeat, of, guerilla, forces, when, revealed, does, not, disable, this, type, of, organisation, many, modern, attack, strategies, will, tend, to, increase, the, power, of, the, group, they, intend, to, weaken, a, new, more, political, strategy, is, perhaps, more, appropriate, here, with, military, backing, such, a, strategy, has, been, illustrated, in, the, war, against, the, ira, though, an, adoption, and, codification, are, unclear, a, main, point, in, asymmetric, warfare, is, the, nature, of, paramilitary, organizations, such, as, al, qaeda, which, are, involved, in, guerrilla, military, actions, but, which, are, not, traditional, organizations, with, a, central, authority, defining, their, military, and, political, strategies, organizations, such, as, al, qaeda, may, exist, as, a, sparse, network, of, groups, lacking, central, coordination, making, them, more, difficult, to, confront, following, standard, strategic, approaches, this, new, field, of, strategic, thinking, is, tackled, by, what, is, now, defined, as, netwar
