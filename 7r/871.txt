identity, is, the, set, of, qualities, beliefs, personality, traits, appearance, and, or, expressions, that, characterize, a, person, or, a, group, identity, emerges, during, childhood, as, children, start, to, comprehend, their, self, concept, and, it, remains, a, consistent, aspect, throughout, different, stages, of, life, identity, is, shaped, by, social, and, cultural, factors, and, how, others, perceive, and, acknowledge, one, s, characteristics, the, etymology, of, the, term, identity, from, the, latin, noun, identitas, emphasizes, an, individual, s, mental, image, of, themselves, and, their, sameness, with, others, identity, encompasses, various, aspects, such, as, occupational, religious, national, ethnic, or, racial, gender, educational, generational, and, political, identities, among, others, identity, serves, multiple, functions, acting, as, a, self, regulatory, structure, that, provides, meaning, direction, and, a, sense, of, self, control, it, fosters, internal, harmony, and, serves, as, a, behavioral, compass, enabling, individuals, to, orient, themselves, towards, the, future, and, establish, long, term, goals, as, an, active, process, it, profoundly, influences, an, individual, s, capacity, to, adapt, to, life, events, and, achieve, a, state, of, well, being, however, identity, originates, from, traits, or, attributes, that, individuals, may, have, little, or, no, control, over, such, as, their, family, background, or, ethnicity, in, sociology, emphasis, is, placed, by, sociologists, on, collective, identity, in, which, an, individual, s, identity, is, strongly, associated, with, role, behavior, or, the, collection, of, group, memberships, that, define, them, according, to, peter, burke, identities, tell, us, who, we, are, and, they, announce, to, others, who, we, are, identities, subsequently, guide, behavior, leading, fathers, to, behave, like, fathers, and, nurses, to, act, like, nurses, in, psychology, the, term, identity, is, most, commonly, used, to, describe, personal, identity, or, the, distinctive, qualities, or, traits, that, make, an, individual, unique, identities, are, strongly, associated, with, self, concept, self, image, one, s, mental, model, of, oneself, self, esteem, and, individuality, individuals, identities, are, situated, but, also, contextual, situationally, adaptive, and, changing, despite, their, fluid, character, identities, often, feel, as, if, they, are, stable, ubiquitous, categories, defining, an, individual, because, of, their, grounding, in, the, sense, of, personal, identity, the, sense, of, being, a, continuous, and, persistent, self, mark, mazower, noted, in, 1998, at, some, point, in, the, 1970s, this, term, was, borrowed, from, social, psychology, and, applied, with, abandon, to, societies, nations, and, groups, erik, erikson, 1902, 94, became, one, of, the, earliest, psychologists, to, take, an, explicit, interest, in, identity, an, essential, feature, of, erikson, s, theory, of, psychosocial, development, was, the, idea, of, the, ego, identity, often, referred, to, as, the, self, which, is, described, as, an, individual, s, personal, sense, of, continuity, he, suggested, that, people, can, attain, this, feeling, throughout, their, lives, as, they, develop, and, is, meant, to, be, an, ongoing, process, the, ego, identity, consists, of, two, main, features, one, s, personal, characteristics, and, development, and, the, culmination, of, social, and, cultural, factors, and, roles, that, impact, one, s, identity, in, erikson, s, theory, he, describes, eight, distinct, stages, across, the, lifespan, that, are, each, characterized, by, a, conflict, between, the, inner, personal, world, and, the, outer, social, world, of, an, individual, erikson, identified, the, conflict, of, identity, as, occurring, primarily, during, adolescence, and, described, potential, outcomes, that, depend, on, how, one, deals, with, this, conflict, those, who, do, not, manage, a, resynthesis, of, childhood, identifications, are, seen, as, being, in, a, state, of, identity, diffusion, whereas, those, who, retain, their, given, identities, unquestioned, have, foreclosed, identities, on, some, readings, of, erikson, the, development, of, a, strong, ego, identity, along, with, the, proper, integration, into, a, stable, society, and, culture, lead, to, a, stronger, sense, of, identity, in, general, accordingly, a, deficiency, in, either, of, these, factors, may, increase, the, chance, of, an, identity, crisis, or, confusion, the, neo, eriksonian, identity, status, paradigm, emerged, in, 1966, driven, largely, by, the, work, of, james, marcia, this, model, focuses, on, the, concepts, of, exploration, and, commitment, the, central, idea, is, that, an, individual, s, sense, of, identity, is, determined, in, large, part, by, the, degrees, to, which, a, person, has, made, certain, explorations, and, the, extent, to, which, they, have, commitments, to, those, explorations, or, a, particular, identity, a, person, may, display, either, relative, weakness, or, strength, in, terms, of, both, exploration, and, commitments, when, assigned, categories, there, were, four, possible, results, identity, diffusion, identity, foreclosure, identity, moratorium, and, identity, achievement, diffusion, is, when, a, person, avoids, or, refuses, both, exploration, and, making, a, commitment, foreclosure, occurs, when, a, person, does, make, a, commitment, to, a, particular, identity, but, neglected, to, explore, other, options, identity, moratorium, is, when, a, person, avoids, or, postpones, making, a, commitment, but, is, still, actively, exploring, their, options, and, different, identities, lastly, identity, achievement, is, when, a, person, has, both, explored, many, possibilities, and, has, committed, to, their, identity, although, the, self, is, distinct, from, identity, the, literature, of, self, psychology, can, offer, some, insight, into, how, identity, is, maintained, from, the, vantage, point, of, self, psychology, there, are, two, areas, of, interest, the, processes, by, which, a, self, is, formed, the, i, and, the, actual, content, of, the, schemata, which, compose, the, self, concept, the, me, in, the, latter, field, theorists, have, shown, interest, in, relating, the, self, concept, to, self, esteem, the, differences, between, complex, and, simple, ways, of, organizing, self, knowledge, and, the, links, between, those, organizing, principles, and, the, processing, of, information, weinreich, s, identity, variant, similarly, includes, the, categories, of, identity, diffusion, foreclosure, and, crisis, but, with, a, somewhat, different, emphasis, here, with, respect, to, identity, diffusion, for, example, an, optimal, level, is, interpreted, as, the, norm, as, it, is, unrealistic, to, expect, an, individual, to, resolve, all, their, conflicted, identifications, with, others, therefore, we, should, be, alert, to, individuals, with, levels, which, are, much, higher, or, lower, than, the, norm, highly, diffused, individuals, are, classified, as, diffused, and, those, with, low, levels, as, foreclosed, or, defensive, weinreich, applies, the, identity, variant, in, a, framework, which, also, allows, for, the, transition, from, one, to, another, by, way, of, biographical, experiences, and, resolution, of, conflicted, identifications, situated, in, various, contexts, for, example, an, adolescent, going, through, family, break, up, may, be, in, one, state, whereas, later, in, a, stable, marriage, with, a, secure, professional, role, may, be, in, another, hence, though, there, is, continuity, there, is, also, development, and, change, laing, s, definition, of, identity, closely, follows, erikson, s, in, emphasising, the, past, present, and, future, components, of, the, experienced, self, he, also, develops, the, concept, of, the, metaperspective, of, self, i, e, the, self, s, perception, of, the, other, s, view, of, self, which, has, been, found, to, be, extremely, important, in, clinical, contexts, such, as, anorexia, nervosa, harr, also, conceptualises, components, of, self, identity, the, person, the, unique, being, i, am, to, myself, and, others, along, with, aspects, of, self, including, a, totality, of, attributes, including, beliefs, about, one, s, characteristics, including, life, history, and, the, personal, characteristics, displayed, to, others, at, a, general, level, self, psychology, is, compelled, to, investigate, the, question, of, how, the, personal, self, relates, to, the, social, environment, to, the, extent, that, these, theories, place, themselves, in, the, tradition, of, psychological, social, psychology, they, focus, on, explaining, an, individual, s, actions, within, a, group, in, terms, of, mental, events, and, states, however, some, sociological, social, psychology, theories, go, further, by, attempting, to, deal, with, the, issue, of, identity, at, both, the, levels, of, individual, cognition, and, of, collective, behaviour, many, people, gain, a, sense, of, positive, self, esteem, from, their, identity, groups, which, furthers, a, sense, of, community, and, belonging, another, issue, that, researchers, have, attempted, to, address, is, the, question, of, why, people, engage, in, discrimination, i, e, why, they, tend, to, favour, those, they, consider, a, part, of, their, in, group, over, those, considered, to, be, outsiders, both, questions, have, been, given, extensive, attention, by, researchers, working, in, the, social, identity, tradition, for, example, in, work, relating, to, social, identity, theory, it, has, been, shown, that, merely, crafting, cognitive, distinction, between, in, and, out, groups, can, lead, to, subtle, effects, on, people, s, evaluations, of, others, different, social, situations, also, compel, people, to, attach, themselves, to, different, self, identities, which, may, cause, some, to, feel, marginalized, switch, between, different, groups, and, self, identifications, or, reinterpret, certain, identity, components, these, different, selves, lead, to, constructed, images, dichotomized, between, what, people, want, to, be, the, ideal, self, and, how, others, see, them, the, limited, self, educational, background, and, occupational, status, and, roles, significantly, influence, identity, formation, in, this, regard, another, issue, of, interest, in, social, psychology, is, related, to, the, notion, that, there, are, certain, identity, formation, strategies, which, a, person, may, use, to, adapt, to, the, social, world, cote, and, levine, developed, a, typology, which, investigated, the, different, manners, of, behavior, that, individuals, may, have, their, typology, includes, kenneth, gergen, formulated, additional, classifications, which, include, the, strategic, manipulator, the, pastiche, personality, and, the, relational, self, the, strategic, manipulator, is, a, person, who, begins, to, regard, all, senses, of, identity, merely, as, role, playing, exercises, and, who, gradually, becomes, alienated, from, their, social, self, the, pastiche, personality, abandons, all, aspirations, toward, a, true, or, essential, identity, instead, viewing, social, interactions, as, opportunities, to, play, out, and, hence, become, the, roles, they, play, finally, the, relational, self, is, a, perspective, by, which, persons, abandon, all, sense, of, exclusive, self, and, view, all, sense, of, identity, in, terms, of, social, engagement, with, others, for, gergen, these, strategies, follow, one, another, in, phases, and, they, are, linked, to, the, increase, in, popularity, of, postmodern, culture, and, the, rise, of, telecommunications, technology, anthropologists, have, most, frequently, employed, the, term, identity, to, refer, to, this, idea, of, selfhood, in, a, loosely, eriksonian, way, properties, based, on, the, uniqueness, and, individuality, which, makes, a, person, distinct, from, others, identity, became, of, more, interest, to, anthropologists, with, the, emergence, of, modern, concerns, with, ethnicity, and, social, movements, in, the, 1970s, this, was, reinforced, by, an, appreciation, following, the, trend, in, sociological, thought, of, the, manner, in, which, the, individual, is, affected, by, and, contributes, to, the, overall, social, context, at, the, same, time, the, eriksonian, approach, to, identity, remained, in, force, with, the, result, that, identity, has, continued, until, recently, to, be, used, in, a, largely, socio, historical, way, to, refer, to, qualities, of, sameness, in, relation, to, a, person, s, connection, to, others, and, to, a, particular, group, of, people, the, first, favours, a, primordialist, approach, which, takes, the, sense, of, self, and, belonging, to, a, collective, group, as, a, fixed, thing, defined, by, objective, criteria, such, as, common, ancestry, and, common, biological, characteristics, the, second, rooted, in, social, constructionist, theory, takes, the, view, that, identity, is, formed, by, a, predominantly, political, choice, of, certain, characteristics, in, so, doing, it, questions, the, idea, that, identity, is, a, natural, given, characterised, by, fixed, supposedly, objective, criteria, both, approaches, need, to, be, understood, in, their, respective, political, and, historical, contexts, characterised, by, debate, on, issues, of, class, race, and, ethnicity, while, they, have, been, criticized, they, continue, to, exert, an, influence, on, approaches, to, the, conceptualisation, of, identity, today, these, different, explorations, of, identity, demonstrate, how, difficult, a, concept, it, is, to, pin, down, since, identity, is, a, virtual, thing, it, is, impossible, to, define, it, empirically, discussions, of, identity, use, the, term, with, different, meanings, from, fundamental, and, abiding, sameness, to, fluidity, contingency, negotiated, and, so, on, brubaker, and, cooper, note, a, tendency, in, many, scholars, to, confuse, identity, as, a, category, of, practice, and, as, a, category, of, analysis, indeed, many, scholars, demonstrate, a, tendency, to, follow, their, own, preconceptions, of, identity, following, more, or, less, the, frameworks, listed, above, rather, than, taking, into, account, the, mechanisms, by, which, the, concept, is, crystallised, as, reality, in, this, environment, some, analysts, such, as, brubaker, and, cooper, have, suggested, doing, away, with, the, concept, completely, others, by, contrast, have, sought, to, introduce, alternative, concepts, in, an, attempt, to, capture, the, dynamic, and, fluid, qualities, of, human, social, self, expression, stuart, hall, for, example, suggests, treating, identity, as, a, process, to, take, into, account, the, reality, of, diverse, and, ever, changing, social, experience, some, scholars, have, introduced, the, idea, of, identification, whereby, identity, is, perceived, as, made, up, of, different, components, that, are, identified, and, interpreted, by, individuals, the, construction, of, an, individual, sense, of, self, is, achieved, by, personal, choices, regarding, who, and, what, to, associate, with, such, approaches, are, liberating, in, their, recognition, of, the, role, of, the, individual, in, social, interaction, and, the, construction, of, identity, anthropologists, have, contributed, to, the, debate, by, shifting, the, focus, of, research, one, of, the, first, challenges, for, the, researcher, wishing, to, carry, out, empirical, research, in, this, area, is, to, identify, an, appropriate, analytical, tool, the, concept, of, boundaries, is, useful, here, for, demonstrating, how, identity, works, in, the, same, way, as, barth, in, his, approach, to, ethnicity, advocated, the, critical, focus, for, investigation, as, being, the, ethnic, boundary, that, defines, the, group, rather, than, the, cultural, stuff, that, it, encloses, social, anthropologists, such, as, cohen, and, bray, have, shifted, the, focus, of, analytical, study, from, identity, to, the, boundaries, that, are, used, for, purposes, of, identification, if, identity, is, a, kind, of, virtual, site, in, which, the, dynamic, processes, and, markers, used, for, identification, are, made, apparent, boundaries, provide, the, framework, on, which, this, virtual, site, is, built, they, concentrated, on, how, the, idea, of, community, belonging, is, differently, constructed, by, individual, members, and, how, individuals, within, the, group, conceive, ethnic, boundaries, as, a, non, directive, and, flexible, analytical, tool, the, concept, of, boundaries, helps, both, to, map, and, to, define, the, changeability, and, mutability, that, are, characteristic, of, people, s, experiences, of, the, self, in, society, while, identity, is, a, volatile, flexible, and, abstract, thing, its, manifestations, and, the, ways, in, which, it, is, exercised, are, often, open, to, view, identity, is, made, evident, through, the, use, of, markers, such, as, language, dress, behaviour, and, choice, of, space, whose, effect, depends, on, their, recognition, by, other, social, beings, markers, help, to, create, the, boundaries, that, define, similarities, or, differences, between, the, marker, wearer, and, the, marker, perceivers, their, effectiveness, depends, on, a, shared, understanding, of, their, meaning, in, a, social, context, misunderstandings, can, arise, due, to, a, misinterpretation, of, the, significance, of, specific, markers, equally, an, individual, can, use, markers, of, identity, to, exert, influence, on, other, people, without, necessarily, fulfilling, all, the, criteria, that, an, external, observer, might, typically, associate, with, such, an, abstract, identity, boundaries, can, be, inclusive, or, exclusive, depending, on, how, they, are, perceived, by, other, people, an, exclusive, boundary, arises, for, example, when, a, person, adopts, a, marker, that, imposes, restrictions, on, the, behaviour, of, others, an, inclusive, boundary, is, created, by, contrast, by, the, use, of, a, marker, with, which, other, people, are, ready, and, able, to, associate, at, the, same, time, however, an, inclusive, boundary, will, also, impose, restrictions, on, the, people, it, has, included, by, limiting, their, inclusion, within, other, boundaries, an, example, of, this, is, the, use, of, a, particular, language, by, a, newcomer, in, a, room, full, of, people, speaking, various, languages, some, people, may, understand, the, language, used, by, this, person, while, others, may, not, those, who, do, not, understand, it, might, take, the, newcomer, s, use, of, this, particular, language, merely, as, a, neutral, sign, of, identity, but, they, might, also, perceive, it, as, imposing, an, exclusive, boundary, that, is, meant, to, mark, them, off, from, the, person, on, the, other, hand, those, who, do, understand, the, newcomer, s, language, could, take, it, as, an, inclusive, boundary, through, which, the, newcomer, associates, themself, with, them, to, the, exclusion, of, the, other, people, present, equally, however, it, is, possible, that, people, who, do, understand, the, newcomer, but, who, also, speak, another, language, may, not, want, to, speak, the, newcomer, s, language, and, so, see, their, marker, as, an, imposition, and, a, negative, boundary, it, is, possible, that, the, newcomer, is, either, aware, or, unaware, of, this, depending, on, whether, they, themself, knows, other, languages, or, is, conscious, of, the, plurilingual, quality, of, the, people, there, and, is, respectful, of, it, or, not, a, religious, identity, is, the, set, of, beliefs, and, practices, generally, held, by, an, individual, involving, adherence, to, codified, beliefs, and, rituals, and, study, of, ancestral, or, cultural, traditions, writings, history, mythology, and, faith, and, mystical, experience, religious, identity, refers, to, the, personal, practices, related, to, communal, faith, along, with, rituals, and, communication, stemming, from, such, conviction, this, identity, formation, begins, with, an, association, in, the, parents, religious, contacts, and, individuation, requires, that, the, person, chooses, the, same, or, different, religious, identity, than, that, of, their, parents, the, parable, of, the, lost, sheep, is, one, of, the, parables, of, jesus, it, is, about, a, shepherd, who, leaves, his, flock, of, ninety, nine, sheep, in, order, to, find, the, one, which, is, lost, the, parable, of, the, lost, sheep, is, an, example, of, the, rediscovery, of, identity, its, aim, is, to, lay, bare, the, nature, of, the, divine, response, to, the, recovery, of, the, lost, with, the, lost, sheep, representing, a, lost, human, being, christian, meditation, is, a, specific, form, of, personality, formation, though, often, used, only, by, certain, practitioners, to, describe, various, forms, of, prayer, and, the, process, of, knowing, the, contemplation, of, god, in, western, culture, personal, and, secular, identity, are, deeply, influenced, by, the, formation, of, christianity, throughout, history, various, western, thinkers, who, contributed, to, the, development, of, european, identity, were, influenced, by, classical, cultures, and, incorporated, elements, of, greek, culture, as, well, as, jewish, culture, leading, to, some, movements, such, as, philhellenism, and, philosemitism, due, to, the, multiple, functions, of, identity, which, include, self, regulation, self, concept, personal, control, meaning, and, direction, its, implications, are, woven, into, many, aspects, of, life, identity, transformations, can, occur, in, various, contexts, some, of, which, include, immigration, and, acculturation, often, lead, to, shifts, in, social, identity, the, extent, of, this, change, depends, on, the, disparities, between, the, individual, s, heritage, culture, and, the, culture, of, the, host, country, as, well, as, the, level, of, adoption, of, the, new, culture, versus, the, retention, of, the, heritage, culture, however, the, effects, of, immigration, and, acculturation, on, identity, can, be, moderated, if, the, person, possesses, a, strong, personal, identity, this, established, personal, identity, can, serve, as, an, anchor, and, play, a, protective, role, during, the, process, of, social, and, cultural, identity, transformations, that, occur, identity, is, an, ongoing, and, dynamic, process, that, impacts, an, individual, s, ability, to, navigate, life, s, challenges, and, cultivate, a, fulfilling, existence, within, this, process, occupation, emerges, as, a, significant, factor, that, allows, individuals, to, express, and, maintain, their, identity, occupation, encompasses, not, only, careers, or, jobs, but, also, activities, such, as, travel, volunteering, sports, or, caregiving, however, when, individuals, face, limitations, in, their, ability, to, participate, or, engage, in, meaningful, activities, such, as, due, to, illness, it, poses, a, threat, to, the, active, process, and, continued, development, of, identity, feeling, socially, unproductive, can, have, detrimental, effects, on, one, s, social, identity, importantly, the, relationship, between, occupation, and, identity, is, bidirectional, occupation, contributes, to, the, formation, of, identity, while, identity, shapes, decisions, regarding, occupational, choices, furthermore, individuals, inherently, seek, a, sense, of, control, over, their, chosen, occupation, and, strive, to, avoid, stigmatizing, labels, that, may, undermine, their, occupational, identity, in, the, realm, of, occupational, identity, individuals, make, choices, regarding, employment, based, on, the, stigma, associated, with, certain, jobs, likewise, those, already, working, in, stigmatized, occupations, may, employ, personal, rationalization, to, justify, their, career, path, factors, such, as, workplace, satisfaction, and, overall, quality, of, life, play, significant, roles, in, these, decisions, individuals, in, such, jobs, face, the, challenge, of, forging, an, identity, that, aligns, with, their, values, and, beliefs, crafting, a, positive, self, concept, becomes, more, arduous, when, societal, standards, label, their, work, as, dirty, or, undesirable, consequently, some, individuals, opt, not, to, define, themselves, solely, by, their, occupation, but, strive, for, a, holistic, identity, that, encompasses, all, aspects, of, their, lives, beyond, their, job, or, work, on, the, other, hand, individuals, whose, identity, strongly, hinges, on, their, occupation, may, experience, a, crisis, if, they, become, unable, to, perform, their, chosen, work, therefore, occupational, identity, necessitates, an, active, and, adaptable, process, that, ensures, both, adaptation, and, continuity, amid, shifting, circumstances, the, modern, notion, of, personal, identity, as, a, distinct, and, unique, characteristic, of, individuals, has, evolved, relatively, recently, in, history, beginning, with, the, first, passports, in, the, early, 1900s, and, later, becoming, more, popular, as, a, social, science, term, in, the, 1950s, several, factors, have, influenced, its, evolution, including
