passover, also, called, pesach, p, s, x, p, e, biblical, hebrew, romanized, ag, happesa, lit, pilgrimage, of, the, passing, over, is, a, major, jewish, holiday, and, one, of, the, three, pilgrimage, festivals, it, celebrates, the, exodus, of, the, israelites, from, slavery, in, egypt, according, to, the, book, of, exodus, god, commanded, moses, to, tell, the, israelites, to, slaughter, a, lamb, and, mark, their, doorframes, with, its, blood, in, addition, to, instructions, for, consuming, the, lamb, that, night, for, that, night, god, would, send, the, angel, of, death, to, bring, about, the, tenth, plague, in, which, he, would, smite, all, the, firstborn, in, egypt, but, when, the, angel, saw, the, blood, on, the, israelites, doorframes, he, would, pass, over, their, homes, so, that, the, plague, should, not, enter, hence, the, name, the, story, is, part, of, the, broader, exodus, narrative, in, which, the, israelites, while, living, in, egypt, are, enslaved, en, masse, by, the, pharaoh, to, suppress, them, when, pharaoh, refuses, god, s, demand, to, let, them, go, god, sends, ten, plagues, upon, egypt, after, the, tenth, plague, pharaoh, permits, the, israelites, to, leave, this, story, is, recounted, at, the, passover, seder, by, reading, the, haggadah, the, haggadah, is, a, standardized, ritual, account, of, the, exodus, story, in, fulfillment, of, the, command, and, thou, shalt, tell, thy, son, in, that, day, saying, it, is, because, of, that, which, the, l, ord, did, for, me, when, i, came, forth, out, of, egypt, pesach, starts, on, the, 15th, day, of, the, hebrew, month, of, nisan, which, is, considered, the, first, month, of, the, hebrew, year, the, rabbinical, jewish, calendar, is, adjusted, to, align, with, the, solar, calendar, in, such, a, way, that, 15, nisan, always, coincides, with, sunday, tuesday, thursday, or, saturday, the, hebrew, day, starts, and, ends, at, sunset, so, the, holiday, starts, at, sunset, the, day, before, for, example, in, 2024, 15, nisan, coincides, with, tuesday, april, 23, therefore, pesach, starts, at, sundown, on, monday, april, 22, biblical, hebrew, is, rendered, as, tiberian, and, modern, hebrew, pesa, pesakh, the, verb, p, sa, is, first, mentioned, in, the, torah, s, account, of, the, exodus, and, there, is, some, debate, about, its, exact, meaning, the, commonly, held, assumption, that, it, means, he, passed, over, in, reference, to, god, passing, over, or, skipping, the, houses, of, the, hebrews, during, the, final, of, the, ten, plagues, of, egypt, stems, from, the, translation, provided, in, the, septuagint, ancient, greek, romanized, pareleusetai, in, exodus, 12, 23, and, eskepasen, in, exodus, 12, 27, the, targum, onkelos, written, in, jewish, babylonian, aramaic, translates, pesach, as, hebrew, romanized, w, y, os, lit, he, had, pity, coming, from, the, hebrew, root, meaning, to, have, pity, cognate, languages, yield, similar, terms, with, distinct, meanings, such, as, make, soft, soothe, placate, akkadian, passahu, harvest, commemoration, blow, egyptian, or, separate, arabic, fsh, pesach, may, also, refer, to, the, lamb, or, goat, which, was, designated, as, the, passover, sacrifice, four, days, before, the, exodus, the, hebrews, were, commanded, to, set, aside, a, lamb, and, inspect, it, daily, for, blemishes, during, the, day, on, 14th, nisan, they, were, to, slaughter, the, animal, and, use, its, blood, to, mark, their, lintels, and, door, posts, before, midnight, on, 15th, nisan, they, were, to, consume, the, lamb, the, english, term, passover, is, first, known, to, be, recorded, in, the, english, language, in, william, tyndale, s, translation, of, the, bible, later, appearing, in, the, king, james, version, as, well, it, is, a, literal, translation, of, the, hebrew, term, in, the, king, james, version, exodus, 12, 23, reads, for, the, l, ord, will, pass, through, to, smite, the, egyptians, and, when, he, seeth, the, blood, upon, the, lintel, and, on, the, two, side, posts, the, l, ord, will, pass, over, the, door, and, will, not, suffer, the, destroyer, to, come, in, unto, your, houses, to, smite, you, the, passover, ritual, is, a, mitzvah, commanded, by, torah, rather, than, of, rabbinic, origin, the, passover, ritual, is, thought, by, modern, scholars, to, have, its, origins, in, an, apotropaic, rite, unrelated, to, the, exodus, to, ensure, the, protection, of, a, family, home, a, rite, conducted, wholly, within, a, clan, ezov, was, employed, to, daub, the, blood, of, a, slaughtered, sheep, on, the, lintels, and, door, posts, to, ensure, that, demonic, forces, could, not, enter, the, home, a, further, hypothesis, maintains, that, once, the, priestly, code, was, promulgated, the, exodus, narrative, took, on, a, central, function, as, the, apotropaic, rite, was, arguably, amalgamated, with, the, canaanite, agricultural, festival, of, spring, which, was, a, ceremony, of, unleavened, bread, connected, with, the, barley, harvest, as, the, exodus, motif, grew, the, original, function, and, symbolism, of, these, double, origins, was, lost, several, motifs, replicate, the, features, associated, with, the, akitu, spring, festival, of, ancient, mesopotamian, religion, which, celebrates, the, sowing, of, barley, scholars, john, van, seters, judah, segal, and, tamara, pro, i, disagree, with, the, merged, two, festivals, hypothesis, in, the, book, of, exodus, the, israelites, are, enslaved, in, ancient, egypt, yahweh, the, god, of, the, israelites, appears, to, moses, in, a, burning, bush, and, commands, moses, to, confront, the, pharaoh, to, show, his, power, yahweh, inflicts, a, series, of, ten, plagues, on, the, egyptians, culminating, in, the, plague, of, the, death, of, the, firstborn, moses, said, thus, says, toward, midnight, i, will, go, forth, among, the, egyptians, and, every, first, born, in, the, land, of, egypt, shall, die, from, the, first, born, of, pharaoh, who, sits, on, his, throne, to, the, first, born, of, the, slave, girl, who, is, behind, the, millstones, and, all, the, first, born, of, the, cattle, and, there, shall, be, a, loud, cry, in, all, the, land, of, egypt, such, as, has, never, been, or, will, ever, be, again, before, this, final, plague, yahweh, commands, moses, to, tell, the, israelites, to, mark, a, lamb, s, blood, above, their, doors, so, god, will, pass, over, them, and, the, plague, of, the, death, of, the, firstborn, will, not, afflict, them, the, biblical, regulations, for, the, observance, of, the, festival, require, that, all, leavening, be, disposed, of, before, the, beginning, of, the, 15th, of, nisan, according, to, exodus, 13, 7, an, unblemished, lamb, or, goat, known, as, the, passover, sacrifice, or, paschal, lamb, is, to, be, set, apart, on, 10th, nisan, and, slaughtered, at, dusk, as, 14th, nisan, ends, in, preparation, for, the, 15th, of, nisan, when, it, will, be, eaten, after, being, roasted, the, literal, meaning, of, the, hebrew, is, between, the, two, evenings, it, is, then, to, be, eaten, that, night, 15th, nisan, roasted, without, the, removal, of, its, internal, organs, with, unleavened, bread, known, as, matzah, and, bitter, herbs, known, as, maror, nothing, of, the, sacrifice, on, which, the, sun, rises, by, the, morning, of, the, 15th, of, nisan, may, be, eaten, but, must, be, burned, the, biblical, regulations, of, the, original, passover, at, the, time, of, the, exodus, only, also, include, how, the, meal, was, to, be, eaten, your, loins, girded, your, sandals, on, your, feet, and, your, staff, in, your, hand, and, you, shall, eat, it, hurriedly, it, is, a, passover, offering, to, the, biblical, requirements, of, slaying, the, paschal, lamb, in, the, individual, homes, of, the, hebrews, and, smearing, the, blood, of, the, lamb, on, their, doorways, were, celebrated, in, egypt, however, once, israel, was, in, the, wilderness, and, the, tabernacle, was, in, operation, a, change, was, made, in, those, two, original, requirements, passover, lambs, were, to, be, sacrificed, at, the, door, of, the, tabernacle, and, no, longer, in, the, homes, of, the, jews, no, longer, therefore, could, blood, be, smeared, on, doorways, called, the, festival, the, unleavened, bread, biblical, hebrew, romanized, a, ham, ma, o, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, commandment, to, keep, passover, is, recorded, in, the, book, of, leviticus, in, the, first, month, on, the, fourteenth, day, of, the, month, at, dusk, is, the, lord, s, passover, and, on, the, fifteenth, day, of, the, same, month, is, the, feast, of, unleavened, bread, unto, the, lord, seven, days, ye, shall, eat, unleavened, bread, in, the, first, day, ye, shall, have, a, holy, convocation, ye, shall, do, no, manner, of, servile, work, and, ye, shall, bring, an, offering, made, by, fire, unto, the, lord, seven, days, in, the, seventh, day, is, a, holy, convocation, ye, shall, do, no, manner, of, servile, work, the, sacrifices, may, be, performed, only, in, a, specific, place, prescribed, by, god, for, judaism, this, is, jerusalem, the, biblical, commandments, concerning, the, passover, and, the, feast, of, unleavened, bread, stress, the, importance, of, remembering, in, 2, kings, 23, 21, 23, and, 2, chronicles, 35, 1, 19, king, josiah, of, judah, restores, the, celebration, of, the, passover, to, a, standard, not, seen, since, the, days, of, the, judges, or, the, days, of, the, prophet, samuel, ezra, 6, 19, 21, records, the, celebration, of, the, passover, by, the, jews, who, had, returned, from, exile, in, babylon, after, the, temple, had, been, rebuilt, some, of, these, details, can, be, corroborated, and, to, some, extent, amplified, in, extrabiblical, sources, the, removal, or, sealing, up, of, the, leaven, is, referred, to, in, the, elephantine, papyri, and, ostraca, in, an, imperial, aramaic, papyrus, letter, from, the, 5th, century, bce, from, elephantine, egypt, the, slaughter, of, the, lambs, on, the, 14th, is, mentioned, in, jubilees, a, jewish, work, of, the, ptolemaic, period, and, by, the, herodian, era, writers, josephus, and, philo, these, sources, also, indicate, that, between, the, two, evenings, was, taken, to, mean, the, afternoon, jubilees, states, the, sacrifice, was, eaten, that, night, and, together, with, josephus, states, that, nothing, of, the, sacrifice, was, allowed, to, remain, until, morning, philo, states, that, the, banquet, included, hymns, and, prayers, the, passover, begins, on, the, 15th, day, of, the, month, of, nisan, which, at, present, falls, between, march, 26, and, april, 25, of, the, gregorian, calendar, the, 15th, day, begins, in, the, evening, after, the, 14th, day, and, the, seder, meal, is, eaten, that, evening, passover, is, a, spring, festival, so, the, 15th, day, of, nisan, typically, begins, on, the, night, of, a, full, moon, after, the, northern, vernal, equinox, however, due, to, leap, months, falling, after, the, vernal, equinox, passover, sometimes, starts, on, the, second, full, moon, after, vernal, equinox, as, in, 2016, to, ensure, that, passover, did, not, start, before, spring, the, tradition, in, ancient, israel, held, that, the, lunar, new, year, the, first, day, of, nisan, would, not, start, until, the, barley, was, ripe, being, the, test, for, the, onset, of, spring, if, the, barley, was, not, ripe, or, various, other, phenomena, indicated, that, spring, was, not, yet, imminent, an, intercalary, month, adar, ii, would, be, added, however, since, at, least, the, 4th, century, the, intercalation, has, been, fixed, mathematically, according, to, the, metonic, cycle, in, israel, passover, is, the, seven, day, holiday, of, the, feast, of, unleavened, bread, with, the, first, and, last, days, celebrated, as, legal, holidays, and, as, holy, days, involving, holiday, meals, special, prayer, services, and, abstention, from, work, the, intervening, days, are, known, as, chol, hamoed, weekdays, the, festival, jews, outside, of, israel, celebrate, the, festival, for, eight, days, reform, and, reconstructionist, jews, usually, celebrate, the, holiday, over, seven, days, karaites, use, a, different, calendar, they, rely, on, visual, identification, of, ripe, barley, and, the, date, of, passover, cannot, be, determined, before, this, some, modern, karaites, follow, the, rabbinical, calendar, in, modern, israel, because, of, social, pressure, the, samaritans, use, a, calendrical, system, that, uses, a, different, method, from, that, current, in, rabbinic, practice, it, sometimes, is, the, same, date, on, the, solar, calendar, sometimes, two, days, later, and, sometimes, an, entire, month, later, in, 2024, rabbinical, passover, begins, at, sunset, on, 22, april, on, the, calendar, used, by, the, samaritans, 22, april, 2024, is, also, the, day, of, the, passover, sacrifice, karaite, and, samaritan, passovers, are, each, one, day, long, followed, by, the, six, day, festival, of, unleavened, bread, for, a, total, of, seven, days, the, main, entity, in, passover, according, to, judaism, is, the, sacrificial, lamb, during, the, existence, of, the, tabernacle, and, later, the, temple, in, jerusalem, the, focus, of, the, passover, festival, was, the, passover, sacrifice, also, known, as, the, paschal, lamb, eaten, during, the, passover, seder, on, the, 15th, of, nisan, every, family, large, enough, to, completely, consume, a, young, lamb, or, wild, goat, was, required, to, offer, one, for, sacrifice, at, the, jewish, temple, on, the, afternoon, of, the, 14th, day, of, nisan, and, eat, it, that, night, which, was, the, 15th, of, nisan, if, the, family, was, too, small, to, finish, eating, the, entire, offering, in, one, sitting, an, offering, was, made, for, a, group, of, families, the, sacrifice, could, not, be, offered, with, anything, leavened, and, had, to, be, roasted, without, its, head, feet, or, inner, organs, being, removed, and, eaten, together, with, unleavened, bread, and, bitter, herbs, maror, one, had, to, be, careful, not, to, break, any, bones, from, the, offering, and, none, of, the, meat, could, be, left, over, by, morning, because, of, the, passover, sacrifice, s, status, as, a, sacred, offering, the, only, people, allowed, to, eat, it, were, those, who, had, the, obligation, to, bring, the, offering, among, those, who, could, not, offer, or, eat, the, passover, lamb, were, an, apostate, a, servant, an, uncircumcised, man, a, person, in, a, state, of, ritual, impurity, except, when, a, majority, of, jews, are, in, such, a, state, and, a, gentile, the, offering, had, to, be, made, before, a, quorum, of, 30, in, the, temple, the, levites, sang, hallel, while, the, priests, performed, the, sacrificial, service, men, and, women, were, equally, obligated, regarding, the, offering, pesahim, 91b, today, in, the, absence, of, the, temple, when, no, sacrifices, are, offered, or, eaten, the, mitzvah, of, the, sacrifice, is, memorialized, in, the, seder, korban, pesach, a, set, of, scriptural, and, rabbinic, passages, dealing, with, the, passover, sacrifice, customarily, recited, after, the, mincha, afternoon, prayer, service, on, the, 14th, of, nisan, and, in, the, form, of, the, zeroa, a, symbolic, food, placed, on, the, passover, seder, plate, but, not, eaten, which, is, usually, a, roasted, shankbone, or, a, chicken, wing, or, neck, the, eating, of, the, afikoman, substitutes, for, the, eating, of, the, sacrifice, at, the, end, of, the, seder, meal, mishnah, pesachim, 119a, many, sephardic, jews, have, the, custom, of, eating, lamb, or, goat, meat, during, the, seder, in, memory, of, the, sacrifice, leaven, in, hebrew, chametz, hebrew, amets, leavening, is, made, from, one, of, five, types, of, grains, combined, with, water, and, left, to, stand, for, more, than, eighteen, minutes, the, consumption, keeping, and, owning, of, chametz, is, forbidden, during, passover, yeast, and, fermentation, are, not, themselves, forbidden, as, seen, for, example, by, wine, which, is, required, rather, than, merely, permitted, according, to, halakha, the, ownership, of, such, chametz, is, also, proscribed, chametz, does, not, include, baking, soda, baking, powder, or, like, products, although, these, are, defined, in, english, as, leavening, agents, they, leaven, by, chemical, reaction, not, by, biological, fermentation, thus, bagels, waffles, and, pancakes, made, with, baking, soda, and, matzah, meal, are, considered, permissible, while, bagels, made, with, sourdough, and, pancakes, and, waffles, made, with, yeast, are, prohibited, the, torah, commandments, regarding, chametz, are, observant, jews, spend, the, weeks, before, passover, in, a, flurry, of, thorough, housecleaning, to, remove, every, morsel, of, chametz, from, every, part, of, the, home, jewish, law, requires, the, elimination, of, olive, sized, or, larger, quantities, of, leavening, from, one, s, possession, but, most, housekeeping, goes, beyond, this, even, the, seams, of, kitchen, counters, are, thoroughly, cleaned, to, remove, traces, of, flour, and, yeast, however, small, any, containers, or, implements, that, have, touched, chametz, are, stored, and, not, used, during, passover, some, hotels, resorts, and, even, cruise, ships, across, america, europe, and, israel, also, undergo, a, thorough, housecleaning, to, make, their, premises, kosher, for, pesach, to, cater, to, observant, jews, some, scholars, suggest, that, the, command, to, abstain, from, leavened, food, or, yeast, suggests, that, sacrifices, offered, to, god, involve, the, offering, of, objects, in, their, least, altered, state, that, would, be, nearest, to, the, way, in, which, they, were, initially, made, by, god, according, to, other, scholars, the, absence, of, leaven, or, yeast, means, that, leaven, or, yeast, symbolizes, corruption, and, spoiling, there, are, also, variations, with, restrictions, on, eating, matzah, before, passover, so, that, there, will, be, an, increased, appetite, for, it, during, passover, itself, primarily, among, chabad, chassidim, there, is, a, custom, of, not, eating, matzah, flat, unleavened, bread, in, the, 30, days, before, passover, begins, others, have, a, custom, to, refrain, from, eating, matzah, from, rosh, chodesh, nissan, while, the, halacha, merely, restricts, one, from, eating, matzah, on, the, day, before, passover, kitniyot, hebrew, qitniyyot, literally, small, things, refers, to, legumes, rice, maize, and, other, foods, that, are, similar, to, grains, ashkenazi, jews, historically, refrain, from, eating, kitniyot, on, passover, despite, there, not, being, a, clear, commandment, to, include, them, in, the, category, of, chametz, since, the, 19th, century, the, reform, movement, has, permitted, eating, kitniyot, and, in, 2015, the, conservative, movement, followed, suit, sephardi, jews, have, always, permitted, eating, kitniyot, on, passover, gebrochts, yiddish, lit, broken, also, known, as, hebrew, romanized, matzah, shruya, lit, soaked, matzah, refers, to, matzah, that, has, absorbed, liquid, some, hasidic, jews, avoid, gebrochts, as, well, to, avoid, the, possibility, that, a, clump, of, flour, that, was, never, properly, mixed, with, water, and, thus, is, still, susceptible, to, leavening, may, come, into, contact, with, the, liquid, leaven, or, chametz, may, be, sold, rather, than, discarded, especially, in, the, case, of, relatively, valuable, forms, such, as, liquor, distilled, from, wheat, with, the, products, being, repurchased, afterward, in, some, cases, they, may, never, leave, the, house, instead, being, formally, sold, while, remaining, in, the, original, owner, s, possession, in, a, locked, cabinet, until, they, can, be, repurchased, after, the, holiday, modern, observance, may, also, include, sealing, cabinets, and, drawers, which, contain, chametz, shut, by, using, adhesive, tape, which, serves, a, similar, purpose, to, a, lock, but, also, shows, evidence, of, tampering, although, the, practice, of, selling, chametz, dates, back, many, years, some, reform, rabbinical, authorities, have, come, to, regard, it, with, disdain, since, the, supposed, new, owner, never, takes, actual, possession, of, the, goods, the, sale, of, chametz, may, also, be, conducted, communally, via, a, rabbi, who, becomes, the, agent, for, all, the, community, s, jews, through, a, halakhic, procedure, called, a, kinyan, acquisition, each, householder, must, put, aside, all, the, chametz, he, is, selling, into, a, box, or, cupboard, and, the, rabbi, enters, into, a, contract, to, sell, all, the, chametz, to, a, non, jew, who, is, not, obligated, to, celebrate, the, commandments, in, exchange, for, a, small, down, payment, e, g, 1, 00, with, the, remainder, due, after, passover, this, sale, is, considered, completely, binding, according, to, halakha, and, at, any, time, during, the, holiday, the, buyer, may, come, to, take, or, partake, of, his, property, the, rabbi, then, re, purchases, the, goods, for, less, than, they, were, sold, at, the, end, of, the, holiday, on, the, night, of, the, fourteenth, of, nisan, the, night, before, the, passover, seder, after, nightfall, on, the, evening, before, passover, eve, jews, do, a, formal, search, in, their, homes, known, as, bedikat, chametz, for, any, possible, remaining, leaven, chametz, the, talmudic, sages, instructed, that, a, search, for, chametz, be, made, in, every, home, place, of, work, or, any, place, where, chametz, may, have, been, brought, during, the, year, when, the, first, seder, is, on, a, saturday, night, the, search, is, conducted, on, the, preceding, thursday, night, thirteenth, of, nisan, as, chametz, cannot, be, burned, during, shabbat, the, talmud, in, pesahim, p, 2a, derives, from, the, torah, that, the, search, for, chametz, be, conducted, by, the, light, of, a, candle, and, therefore, is, done, at, night, and, although, the, final, destruction, of, the, chametz, usually, by, burning, it, in, a, small, bonfire, is, done, on, the, next, morning, the, blessing, is, made, at, night, because, the, search, is, both, in, preparation, for, and, part, of, the, commandments, to, remove, and, destroy, all, chametz, from, one, s, possession, before, the, search, is, begun, there, is, a, special, blessing, if, several, people, or, family, members, assist, in, the, search, then, only, one, person, usually, the, head, of, that, family, recites, the, blessing, having, in, mind, to, include, everyone, present, hebrew, romanized, b, ru, att, a, on, y, eloh, nu, mele, h, ol, m, er, qidd, nu, b, mi, w, w, w, iw, nu, al, b, or, me, the, search, is, then, usually, conducted, by, the, head, of, the, household, joined, by, his, family, including, children, under, the, supervision, of, their, parents, it, is, customary, to, turn, off, the, lights, and, conduct, the, search, by, candlelight, using, a, feather, and, a, wooden, spoon, candlelight, effectively, illuminates, corners, without, casting, shadows, the, feather, can, dust, crumbs, out, of, their, hiding, places, and, the, wooden, spoon, which, collects, the, crumbs, can, be, burned, the, next, day, with, the, hametz, however, most, contemporary, orthodox, authorities, permit, using, a, flashlight, while, some, strongly, encourage, it, due, to, the, danger, coupled, with, using, a, candle, because, the, house, is, assumed, to, have, been, thoroughly, cleaned, by, the, night, before, passover, there, is, some, concern, that, making, a, blessing, over, the, search, for, hametz, will, be, in, vain, bracha, l, vatala, if, nothing, is, found, thus, 10, morsels, of, bread, or, cereal, smaller, than, the, size, of, an, olive, are, traditionally, hidden, throughout, the, house, to, ensure, that, some, hametz, will, be, found, upon, conclusion, of, the, search, with, all, the, small, pieces, safely, wrapped, up, and, put, in, one, bag, or, place, to, be, burned, the, next, morning, the, following, is, said, note, that, if, the, 14th, of, nisan, is, shabbat, many, of, the, below, will, be, celebrated, on, the, 13th, instead, due, to, restrictions, in, place, during, shabbat, on, the, day, preceding, the, first, passover, seder, or, on, thursday, morning, preceding, the, seder, when, the, first, seder, falls, on, motza, ei, shabbat, firstborn, sons, are, commanded, to, celebrate, the, fast, of, the, firstborn, which, commemorates, the, salvation, of, the, hebrew, firstborns, according, to, exodus, 12, 29, god, struck, down, all, egyptian, firstborns, while, the, israelites, were, not, affected, however, it, is, customary, for, synagogues, to, conduct, a, siyum, ceremony, marking, the, completion, of, a, section, of, torah, learning, right, after, morning, prayers, and, the, celebratory, meal, that, follows, cancels, the, firstborn, s, obligation, to, fast, on, the, morning, of, the, 14th, of, nisan, any, leavened, products, that, remain, in, the, householder, s, possession, along, with, the, 10, morsels, of, bread, from, the, previous, night, s, search, are, burned, s, rayfat, chametz, the, head, of, the, household, repeats, the, declaration, of, biyur, chametz, declaring, any, chametz, that, may, not, have, been, found, to, be, null, and, void, as, the, dust, of, the, earth, the, original, declaration, as, recited, in, aramaic, is, should, more, chametz, actually, be, found, in, the, house, during, the, passover, holiday, it, must, be, burnt, as, soon, as, possible, unlike, chametz, which, can, be, eaten, any, day, of, the, year, except, during, passover, kosher, for, passover, foods, can, be, eaten, year, round, they, need, not, be, burnt, or, otherwise, discarded, after, the, holiday, ends, the, historic, passover, sacrifice, has, not, been, brought, following, the, romans, destruction, of, the, second, temple, approximately, two, thousand, years, ago, and, it, is, therefore, still, not, part, of, the, modern, jewish, holiday, in, the, times, when, the, jewish, temples, stood, the, lamb, was, slaughtered, and, cooked, on, the, evening, of, passover, and, was, completely, consumed, before, the, morning, as, described, in, exodus, 12, 3, 11, even, matzot, that, are, kosher, for, passover, cannot, be, eaten, all, day, on, during, the, daylight, hours, before, passover, eve, some, even, practice, this, up, to, 30, days, before, due, to, the, torah, injunction, not, to, eat, chametz, leaven, during, passover, observant, families, typically, own, complete, sets, of, serving, dishes, glassware, and, silverware, and, in, some, cases, even, separate, dishwashers, and, sinks, which, have, never, come, into, contact, with, chametz, for, use, only, during, passover, under, certain, circumstances, some, chametz, utensils, can, be, immersed, in, boiling, water, hagalat, keilim, to, purge, them, of, any, traces, of, chametz, that, may, have, accumulated, during, the, year, many, sephardic, families, thoroughly, wash, their, year, round, glassware, and, then, use, it, for, passover, as, the, sephardic, position, is, that, glass, does, not, absorb, enough, traces, of, food, to, present, a, problem, similarly, ovens, may, be, used, for, passover, either, by, setting, the, self, cleaning, function, to, the, highest, degree, for, a, certain, period, or, by, applying, a, blow, torch, to, the, interior, until, the, oven, glows, red, hot, a, process, called, libun, gamur, a, symbol, of, the, passover, holiday, is, matzah, an, unleavened, flatbread, made, solely, from, flour, and, water, which, is, continually, worked, from, mixing, through, baking, so, that, it, is, not, allowed, to, rise, matzo, may, be, made, by, machine, or, by, hand, the, torah, contains, an, instruction, to, eat, matzah, specifically, on, the, first, night, of, passover, and, to, eat, only, unleavened, bread, in, practice, matzah, during, the, entire, week, of, passover, consequently, the, eating, of, matzah, figures, prominently, in, the, passover, seder, there, are, several, explanations, for, this, the, torah, says, that, it, is, because, the, hebrews, left, egypt, with, such, haste, that, there, was, no, time, to, allow, baked, bread, to, rise, thus, flat, unleavened, bread, matzah, is, a, reminder, of, the, rapid, departure, of, the, exodus, other, scholars, teach, that, in, the, time, of, the, exodus, matzah, was, commonly, baked, to, travel, because, it, preserved, well, and, was, light, to, carry, making, it, similar, to, hardtack, suggesting, that, matzah, was, baked, intentionally, for, the, long, journey, ahead, matzo, has, also, been, called, lechem, oni, hebrew, bread, of, poverty, there, is, an, attendant, explanation, that, matzah, serves, as, a, symbol, to, remind, jews, what, it, is, like, to, be, a, poor, slave, and, to, promote, humility, appreciate, freedom, and, avoid, the, inflated, ego, symbolized, by, more, luxurious, leavened, bread, shmura, matzah, watched, or, guarded, matzah, is, the, bread, of, preference, for, the, passover, seder, in, orthodox, jewish, communities, shmura, matzah, is, made, from, wheat, that, is, guarded, from, contamination, by, leaven, from, the, time, of, summer, harvest, to, its, baking, into, matzot, five, to, ten, months, later, in, the, weeks, before, passover, matzot, are, prepared, for, holiday, consumption, in, many, orthodox, jewish, communities, men, traditionally, gather, in, groups, to, bake, handmade, matzah, for, use, at, the, seder, the, dough, being, rolled, by, hand, resulting, in, a, large, and, round, matzah, groups, also, work, together, in, machine, made, matzah, factories, which, produce, the, typically, square, shaped, matzah, sold, in, stores, the, baking, of, matzah, is, labour, intensive, as, less, than, 18, minutes, is, permitted, between, the, mixing, of, flour, and, water, to, the, conclusion, of, baking, and, removal, from, the, oven, consequently, only, a, small, number, of, matzot, can, be, baked, at, one, time, and, the, group, members, are, enjoined, to, work, the, dough, constantly, so, that, it, is, not, allowed, to, ferment, and, rise, a, special, cutting, tool, is, run, over, the, dough, just, before, baking, to, prick, any, bubbles, which, might, make, the, matza, puff, up, this, creates, the, familiar, dotted, holes, in, the, matzah, after, the, matzot, come, out, of, the, oven, the, entire, work, area, is, scrubbed, down, and, swept, to, make, sure, that, no, pieces, of, old, potentially, leavened, dough, remain, as, any, stray, pieces, are, now, hametz, and, can, contaminate, the, next, batch, of, matzah, some, machine, made, matzot, are, completed, within, five, minutes, of, being, kneaded, it, is, traditional, for, jewish, families, to, gather, on, the, first, night, of, passover, first, two, nights, in, orthodox, and, conservative, communities, outside, israel, for, a, special, dinner, called, a, seder, hebrew, seder, derived, from, the, hebrew, word, for, order, or, arrangement, referring, to, the, very, specific, order, of, the, ritual, the, table, is, set, with, the, finest, china, and, silverware, to, reflect, the, importance, of, the, meal, during, this, meal, the, story, of, the, exodus, from, egypt, is, retold, using, a, special, text, called, the, haggadah, a, total, of, four, cups, of, wine, are, consumed, during, the, recitation, of, the, haggadah, the, seder, is, divided, by, the, haggadah, into, the, following, 15, parts, these, 15, parts, parallel, the, 15, steps, in, the, temple, in, jerusalem, on, which, the, levites, stood, during, temple, services, and, which, were, memorialized, in, the, 15, psalms, 120, 134, known, as, shir, hama, a, lot, hebrew, shiyr, ha, ma, al, th, songs, of, ascent, the, seder, is, replete, with, questions, answers, and, unusual, practices, e, g, the, recital, of, kiddush, which, is, not, immediately, followed, by, the, blessing, over, bread, which, is, the, traditional, procedure, for, all, other, holiday, meals, to, arouse, the, interest, and, curiosity, of, the, children, at, the, table, the, children, are, also, rewarded, with, nuts, and, candies, when, they, ask, questions, and, participate, in, the, discussion, of, the, exodus, and, its, aftermath, likewise, they, are, encouraged, to, search, for, the, afikoman, the, piece, of, matzah, which, is, the, last, thing, eaten, at, the, seder, audience, participation, and, interaction, is, the, rule, and, many, families, seders, last, long, into, the, night, with, animated, discussions, and, singing, the, seder, concludes, with, additional, songs, of, praise, and, faith, printed, in, the, haggadah, including, chad, gadya, one, little, kid, or, one, little, goat, maror, bitter, herbs, symbolizes, the, bitterness, of, slavery, in, egypt, the, following, verse, from, the, torah, underscores, that, symbolism, and, they, embittered, hebrew, ve, yimareru, their, lives, with, hard, labor, with, mortar, and, with, bricks, and, with, all, manner, of, labor, in, the, field, any, labor, that, they, made, them, do, was, with, hard, labor, exodus, 1, 14, there, is, a, rabbinic, requirement, that, four, cups, of, wine, are, to, be, drunk, during, the, seder, meal, this, applies, to, both, men, and, women, the, mishnah, says, pes, 10, 1, that, even, the, poorest, man, in, israel, must, drink, each, cup, is, connected, to, a, different, part, of, the, seder, the, first, cup, is, for, kiddush, the, second, cup, is, connected, with, the, recounting, of, the, exodus, the, drinking, of, the, third, cup, concludes, birkat, hamazon, and, the, fourth, cup, is, associated, with, hallel, a, fifth, cup, of, wine, is, poured, near, the, end, of, the, seder, for, the, prophet, elijah, a, symbol, of, the, future, redemption, which, is, left, un, touched, children, have, a, very, important, role, in, the, passover, seder, traditionally, the, youngest, child, is, prompted, to, ask, questions, about, the, passover, seder, beginning, with, the, words, mah, nishtana, haleila, hazeh, why, is, this, night, different, from, all, other, nights, the, questions, encourage, the, gathering, to, discuss, the, significance, of, the, symbols, in, the, meal, the, questions, asked, by, the, child, are, often, the, leader, of, the, seder, and, the, other, adults, at, the, meal, will, use, prompted, responses, from, the, haggadah, which, states, the, more, one, talks, about, the, exodus, from, egypt, the, more, praiseworthy, he, is, many, readings, prayers, and, stories, are, used, to, recount, the, story, of, the, exodus, many, households, add, their, own, commentary, and, interpretation, and, often, the, story, of, the, jews, is, related, to, the, theme, of, liberation, and, its, implications, worldwide, the, afikoman, an, integral, part, of, the, seder, itself, is, used, to, engage, the, interest, and, excitement, of, the, children, at, the, table, during, the, fourth, part, of, the, seder, called, yachatz, the, leader, breaks, the, middle, piece, of, matzah, into, two, he, sets, aside, the, larger, portion, as, the, afikoman, many, families, use, the, afikoman, as, a, device, for, keeping, the, children, awake, and, alert, throughout, the, seder, proceedings, by, hiding, the, afikoman, and, offering, a, prize, for, its, return, alternatively, the, children, are, allowed, to, steal, the, afikoman, and, demand, a, reward, for, its, return, in, either, case, the, afikoman, must, be, consumed, during, the, twelfth, part, of, the, seder, tzafun, after, the, hallel, the, fourth, glass, of, wine, is, drunk, and, participants, recite, a, prayer, that, ends, in, next, year, in, jerusalem, this, is, followed, by, several, lyric, prayers, that, expound, upon, god, s, mercy, and, kindness, and, give, thanks, for, the, survival, of, the, jewish, people, through, a, history, of, exile, and, hardship, echad, mi, yodea, who, knows, one, is, a, playful, song, testing, the, general, knowledge, of, the, children, and, the, adults, some, of, these, songs, such, as, chad, gadya, are, allegorical, during, passover, the, recitation, of, hallel, a, collection, of, psalms, praising, and, thanking, god, is, an, integral, part, of, the, daily, prayer, service, on, the, initial, day, s, of, passover, it, is, recited, in, its, entirety, similar, to, the, practice, observed, on, shavuot, and, throughout, succot, however, for, the, subsequent, days, of, the, passover, holiday, only, half, of, the, hallel, is, recited, this, traditional, practice, is, widely, observed, by, adherents, of, the, jewish, faith, as, a, way, of, expressing, gratitude, and, celebrating, the, significance, of, passover, while, maintaining, variations, in, the, recitation, of, hallel, based, on, specific, days, within, the, festival, beginning, on, the, second, night, of, passover, the, 16th, day, of, nisan, jews, begin, the, practice, of, the, counting, of, the, omer, a, nightly, reminder, of, the, approach, of, the, holiday, of, shavuot, 50, days, hence, each, night, after, the, evening, prayer, service, men, and, women, recite, a, special, blessing, and, then, enumerate, the, day, of, the, omer, on, the, first, night, for, example, they, say, today, is, the, first, day, in, or, to, the, omer, on, the, second, night, today, is, the, second, day, in, the, omer, the, counting, also, involves, weeks, thus, the, seventh, day, is, commemorated, today, is, the, seventh, day, which, is, one, week, in, the, omer, the, eighth, day, is, marked, today, is, the, eighth, day, which, is, one, week, and, one, day, in, the, omer, etc, when, the, temple, stood, in, jerusalem, a, sheaf, of, new, cut, barley, was, presented, before, the, altar, on, the, second, day, of, unleavened, bread, passover, josephus, writes, on, the, second, day, of, unleavened, bread, that, is, to, say, the, sixteenth, our, people, partake, of, the, crops, which, they, have, reaped, and, which, have, not, been, touched, till, then, and, esteeming, it, right, first, to, do, homage, to, god, to, whom, they, owe, the, abundance, of, these, gifts, they, offer, to, him, the, first, fruits, of, the, barley, in, the, following, way, after, parching, and, crushing, the, little, sheaf, of, ears, and, purifying, the, barley, for, grinding, they, bring, to, the, altar, an, issaron, for, god, and, having, flung, a, handful, thereof, on, the, altar, they, leave, the, rest, for, the, use, of, the, priests, thereafter, all, are, permitted, publicly, or, individually, to, begin, harvest, since, the, destruction, of, the, temple, this, offering, is, brought, in, word, rather, than, deed, one, explanation, for, the, counting, of, the, omer, is, that, it, shows, the, connection, between, passover, and, shavuot, the, physical, freedom, that, the, hebrews, achieved, at, the, exodus, from, egypt, was, only, the, beginning, of, a, process, that, climaxed, with, the, spiritual, freedom, they, gained, at, the, giving, of, the, torah, at, mount, sinai, another, explanation, is, that, the, newborn, nation, which, emerged, after, the, exodus, needed, time, to, learn, their, new, responsibilities, vis, a, vis, torah, and, mitzvot, before, accepting, god, s, law, the, distinction, between, the, omer, offering, a, measure, of, barley, typically, animal, fodder, and, the, shavuot, offering, two, loaves, of, wheat, bread, human, food, symbolizes, the, transition, process, in, israel, passover, lasts, for, seven, days, with, the, first, and, last, days, being, major, jewish, holidays, in, orthodox, and, conservative, communities, no, work, is, performed, on, those, days, with, most, of, the, rules, relating, to, the, observances, of, shabbat, being, applied, outside, israel, in, orthodox, and, conservative, communities, the, holiday, lasts, for, eight, days, with, the, first, two, days, and, last, two, days, being, major, holidays, in, the, intermediate, days, necessary, work, can, be, performed, reform, judaism, observes, passover, over, seven, days, with, the, first, and, last, days, being, major, holidays, like, the, holiday, of, sukkot, the, intermediary, days, of, passover, are, known, as, chol, hamoed, festival, weekdays, and, are, imbued, with, a, semi, festive, status, it, is, a, time, for, family, outings, and, picnic, lunches, of, matzah, hardboiled, eggs, fruits, and, vegetables, and, passover, treats, such, as, macaroons, and, homemade, candies, passover, cake, recipes, call, for, potato, starch, or, passover, cake, flour, made, from, finely, granulated, matzah, instead, of, regular, flour, and, a, large, amount, of, eggs, to, achieve, fluffiness, cookie, recipes, use, matzah, farfel, broken, bits, of, matzah, or, ground, nuts, as, the, base, for, families, with, eastern, european, backgrounds, borsht, a, soup, made, with, beets, is, a, passover, tradition, while, kosher, for, passover, packaged, goods, are, available, in, stores, some, families, opt, to, cook, everything, from, scratch, during, passover, week, in, israel, families, that, do, not, kasher, their, ovens, can, bake, cakes, casseroles, and, even, meat, on, the, stovetop, in, a, wonder, pot, an, israeli, invention, consisting, of, three, parts, an, aluminium, pot, shaped, like, a, bundt, pan, a, hooded, cover, perforated, with, venting, holes, and, a, thick, round, metal, disc, with, a, center, hole, which, is, placed, between, the, wonder, pot, and, the, flame, to, disperse, heat, shvi, i, shel, pesach, seventh, of, passover, is, another, full, jewish, holiday, with, special, prayer, services, and, festive, meals, outside, the, israel, in, the, jewish, diaspora, shvi, i, shel, pesach, is, celebrated, on, both, the, seventh, and, eighth, days, of, passover, this, holiday, commemorates, the, day, the, children, of, israel, reached, the, red, sea, and, witnessed, both, the, miraculous, splitting, of, the, sea, passage, of, the, red, sea, the, drowning, of, all, the, egyptian, chariots, horses, and, soldiers, that, pursued, them, according, to, the, midrash, only, the, pharaoh, was, spared, to, give, testimony, to, the, miracle, that, occurred, hasidic, rebbes, traditionally, hold, a, tish, on, the, night, of, shvi, i, shel, pesach, and, place, a, cup, or, bowl, of, water, on, the, table, before, them, they, use, this, opportunity, to, speak, about, the, splitting, of, the, sea, to, their, disciples, and, sing, songs, of, praise, to, god, the, second, passover, pesach, sheni, on, the, 14th, of, iyar, in, the, hebrew, calendar, is, mentioned, in, the, hebrew, bible, s, book, of, numbers, as, a, make, up, day, for, people, who, were, unable, to, offer, the, pesach, sacrifice, at, the, appropriate, time, due, to, ritual, impurity, or, distance, from, jerusalem, just, as, on, the, first, pesach, night, breaking, bones, from, the, second, paschal, offering, or, leaving, meat, over, until, morning, is, prohibited, today, pesach, sheni, on, the, 14th, of, iyar, has, the, status, of, a, very, minor, holiday, so, much, so, that, many, of, the, jewish, people, have, never, even, heard, of, it, and, it, essentially, does, not, exist, outside, of, orthodox, and, traditional, conservative, judaism, there, are, not, really, any, special, prayers, or, observances, that, are, considered, jewish, law, the, only, change, in, the, liturgy, is, that, in, some, communities, tachanun, a, penitential, prayer, omitted, on, holidays, is, not, said, there, is, a, custom, though, not, jewish, law, to, eat, just, one, piece, of, matzah, on, that, night, bc, ad, because, the, house, is, free, of, leaven, chametz, for, eight, days, the, jewish, household, typically, eats, different, foods, during, the, week, of, passover, some, include, ashkenazi, foods, sephardi, foods, some, see, in, passover, an, important, ecological, lesson, important, to, the, contemporary, situation, with, different, ecological, threats, like, climate, change, for, example, rabbi, yonatan, neril, founder, and, executive, director, of, the, interfaith, center, for, sustainable, development, compares, the, impact, of, climate, change, to, the, plagues, of, egypt, and, the, refusal, of, modern, society, to, change, its, way, of, thinking, to, the, refusal, of, the, pharaoh, to, free, the, jewish, slaves, scientists, discovered, evidence, for, climatic, change, at, the, end, of, the, rule, of, ramesses, ii, which, could, potentially, impact, the, flow, of, the, nile, leading, to, red, algae, bloom, this, could, explain, what, is, described, as, the, ten, plagues, according, to, neril, the, egyptians, were, very, happy, to, have, a, free, source, of, labor, in, the, form, of, israelite, slaves, when, god, said, this, needs, to, stop, they, were, reluctant, to, change, fossil, fuels, in, the, past, 150, years, have, replaced, slave, labor, as, the, key, driver, of, human, society, there, s, a, pharaoh, within, us, that, wants, to, continue, to, do, something, that, s, not, right
