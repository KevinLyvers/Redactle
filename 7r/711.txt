aggression, is, a, behavior, aimed, at, opposing, or, attacking, something, or, someone, though, often, done, with, the, intent, to, cause, harm, it, can, be, channeled, into, creative, and, practical, outlets, for, some, it, may, occur, either, reactively, or, without, provocation, in, humans, aggression, can, be, caused, by, various, triggers, for, example, built, up, frustration, due, to, blocked, goals, or, perceived, disrespect, human, aggression, can, be, classified, into, direct, and, indirect, aggression, while, the, former, is, characterized, by, physical, or, verbal, behavior, intended, to, cause, harm, to, someone, the, latter, is, characterized, by, behavior, intended, to, harm, the, social, relations, of, an, individual, or, group, in, definitions, commonly, used, in, the, social, sciences, and, behavioral, sciences, aggression, is, an, action, or, response, by, an, individual, that, delivers, something, unpleasant, to, another, person, some, definitions, include, that, the, individual, must, intend, to, harm, another, person, in, an, interdisciplinary, perspective, aggression, is, regarded, as, an, ensemble, of, mechanism, formed, during, the, course, of, evolution, in, order, to, assert, oneself, relatives, or, friends, against, others, to, gain, or, to, defend, resources, ultimate, causes, by, harmful, damaging, means, these, mechanisms, are, often, motivated, by, emotions, like, fear, frustration, anger, feelings, of, stress, dominance, or, pleasure, proximate, causes, sometimes, aggressive, behavior, serves, as, a, stress, relief, or, a, subjective, feeling, of, power, predatory, or, defensive, behavior, between, members, of, different, species, may, not, be, considered, aggression, in, the, same, sense, aggression, can, take, a, variety, of, forms, which, may, be, expressed, physically, or, communicated, verbally, or, non, verbally, including, anti, predator, aggression, defensive, aggression, fear, induced, predatory, aggression, dominance, aggression, inter, male, aggression, resident, intruder, aggression, maternal, aggression, species, specific, aggression, sex, related, aggression, territorial, aggression, isolation, induced, aggression, irritable, aggression, and, brain, stimulation, induced, aggression, hypothalamus, there, are, two, subtypes, of, human, aggression, 1, controlled, instrumental, subtype, purposeful, or, goal, oriented, and, 2, reactive, impulsive, subtype, often, elicits, uncontrollable, actions, that, are, inappropriate, or, undesirable, aggression, differs, from, what, is, commonly, called, assertiveness, although, the, terms, are, often, used, interchangeably, among, laypeople, as, in, phrases, such, as, an, aggressive, salesperson, dollard, et, al, 1939, proposed, that, aggression, was, due, to, frustration, which, was, described, as, an, unpleasant, emotion, resulting, from, any, interference, with, achieving, a, rewarding, goal, berkowitz, extended, this, frustration, aggression, hypothesis, and, proposed, that, it, is, not, so, much, the, frustration, as, the, unpleasant, emotion, that, evokes, aggressive, tendencies, and, that, all, aversive, events, produce, negative, affect, and, thereby, aggressive, tendencies, as, well, as, fear, tendencies, besides, conditioned, stimuli, archer, categorized, aggression, evoking, as, well, as, fear, evoking, stimuli, into, three, groups, namely, pain, novelty, and, frustration, although, he, also, described, looming, which, refers, to, an, object, rapidly, moving, towards, the, visual, sensors, of, a, subject, and, can, be, categorized, as, intensity, aggression, can, have, adaptive, benefits, or, negative, effects, aggressive, behavior, is, an, individual, or, collective, social, interaction, that, is, a, hostile, behavior, with, the, intention, of, inflicting, damage, or, harm, two, broad, categories, of, aggression, are, commonly, distinguished, one, includes, affective, emotional, and, hostile, reactive, or, retaliatory, aggression, that, is, a, response, to, provocation, and, the, other, includes, instrumental, goal, oriented, or, predatory, in, which, aggression, is, used, as, a, means, to, achieve, a, goal, an, example, of, hostile, aggression, would, be, a, person, who, punches, someone, who, insulted, him, or, her, an, instrumental, form, of, aggression, would, be, armed, robbery, research, on, violence, from, a, range, of, disciplines, lend, some, support, to, a, distinction, between, affective, and, predatory, aggression, however, some, researchers, question, the, usefulness, of, a, hostile, versus, instrumental, distinction, in, humans, despite, its, ubiquity, in, research, because, most, real, life, cases, involve, mixed, motives, and, interacting, causes, a, number, of, classifications, and, dimensions, of, aggression, have, been, suggested, these, depend, on, such, things, as, whether, the, aggression, is, verbal, or, physical, whether, or, not, it, involves, relational, aggression, such, as, covert, bullying, and, social, manipulation, whether, harm, to, others, is, intended, or, not, whether, it, is, carried, out, actively, or, expressed, passively, and, whether, the, aggression, is, aimed, directly, or, indirectly, classification, may, also, encompass, aggression, related, emotions, e, g, anger, and, mental, states, e, g, impulsivity, hostility, aggression, may, occur, in, response, to, non, social, as, well, as, social, factors, and, can, have, a, close, relationship, with, stress, coping, style, aggression, may, be, displayed, in, order, to, intimidate, the, operative, definition, of, aggression, may, be, affected, by, moral, or, political, views, examples, are, the, axiomatic, moral, view, called, the, non, aggression, principle, and, the, political, rules, governing, the, behavior, of, one, country, toward, another, likewise, in, competitive, sports, or, in, the, workplace, some, forms, of, aggression, may, be, sanctioned, and, others, not, see, workplace, aggression, aggressive, behaviors, are, associated, with, adjustment, problems, and, several, psychopathological, symptoms, such, as, antisocial, personality, disorder, borderline, personality, disorder, and, intermittent, explosive, disorder, biological, approaches, conceptualize, aggression, as, an, internal, energy, released, by, external, stimuli, a, product, of, evolution, through, natural, selection, part, of, genetics, a, product, of, hormonal, fluctuations, psychological, approaches, conceptualize, aggression, as, a, destructive, instinct, a, response, to, frustration, an, affect, excited, by, a, negative, stimulus, a, result, of, observed, learning, of, society, and, diversified, reinforcement, a, resultant, of, variables, that, affect, personal, and, situational, environments, the, term, aggression, comes, from, the, latin, word, aggressio, meaning, attack, the, latin, was, itself, a, joining, of, ad, and, gradi, which, meant, step, at, the, first, known, use, dates, back, to, 1611, in, the, sense, of, an, unprovoked, attack, a, psychological, sense, of, hostile, or, destructive, behavior, dates, back, to, a, 1912, english, translation, of, sigmund, freud, s, writing, alfred, adler, theorized, about, an, aggressive, drive, in, 1908, child, raising, experts, began, to, refer, to, aggression, rather, than, anger, from, the, 1930s, ethologists, study, aggression, as, it, relates, to, the, interaction, and, evolution, of, animals, in, natural, settings, in, such, settings, aggression, can, involve, bodily, contact, such, as, biting, hitting, or, pushing, but, most, conflicts, are, settled, by, threat, displays, and, intimidating, thrusts, that, cause, no, physical, harm, this, form, of, aggression, may, include, the, display, of, body, size, antlers, claws, or, teeth, stereotyped, signals, including, facial, expressions, vocalizations, such, as, bird, song, the, release, of, chemicals, and, changes, in, coloration, the, term, agonistic, behaviour, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, these, forms, of, behavior, most, ethologists, believe, that, aggression, confers, biological, advantages, aggression, may, help, an, animal, secure, territory, including, resources, such, as, food, and, water, aggression, between, males, often, occurs, to, secure, mating, opportunities, and, results, in, selection, of, the, healthier, more, vigorous, animal, aggression, may, also, occur, for, self, protection, or, to, protect, offspring, aggression, between, groups, of, animals, may, also, confer, advantage, for, example, hostile, behavior, may, force, a, population, of, animals, into, a, new, territory, where, the, need, to, adapt, to, a, new, environment, may, lead, to, an, increase, in, genetic, flexibility, the, most, apparent, type, of, interspecific, aggression, is, that, observed, in, the, interaction, between, a, predator, and, its, prey, however, according, to, many, researchers, predation, is, not, aggression, a, cat, does, not, hiss, or, arch, its, back, when, pursuing, a, rat, and, the, active, areas, in, its, hypothalamus, resemble, those, that, reflect, hunger, rather, than, those, that, reflect, aggression, however, others, refer, to, this, behavior, as, predatory, aggression, and, point, out, cases, that, resemble, hostile, behavior, such, as, mouse, killing, by, rats, in, aggressive, mimicry, a, predator, has, the, appearance, of, a, harmless, organism, or, object, attractive, to, the, prey, when, the, prey, approaches, the, predator, attacks, an, animal, defending, against, a, predator, may, engage, in, either, fight, or, flight, or, tend, and, befriend, in, response, to, predator, attack, or, threat, of, attack, depending, on, its, estimate, of, the, predator, s, strength, relative, to, its, own, alternative, defenses, include, a, range, of, antipredator, adaptations, including, alarm, signals, an, example, of, an, alarm, signal, is, nerol, a, chemical, which, is, found, in, the, mandibular, glands, of, trigona, fulviventris, individuals, release, of, nerol, by, t, fulviventris, individuals, in, the, nest, has, been, shown, to, decrease, the, number, of, individuals, leaving, the, nest, by, fifty, percent, as, well, as, increasing, aggressive, behaviors, like, biting, alarm, signals, like, nerol, can, also, act, as, attraction, signals, in, t, fulviventris, individuals, that, have, been, captured, by, a, predator, may, release, nerol, to, attract, nestmates, who, will, proceed, to, attack, or, bite, the, predator, aggression, between, groups, is, determined, partly, by, willingness, to, fight, which, depends, on, a, number, of, factors, including, numerical, advantage, distance, from, home, territories, how, often, the, groups, encounter, each, other, competitive, abilities, differences, in, body, size, and, whose, territory, is, being, invaded, also, an, individual, is, more, likely, to, become, aggressive, if, other, aggressive, group, members, are, nearby, one, particular, phenomenon, the, formation, of, coordinated, coalitions, that, raid, neighbouring, territories, to, kill, conspecifics, has, only, been, documented, in, two, species, in, the, animal, kingdom, common, chimpanzees, and, humans, aggression, between, conspecifics, in, a, group, typically, involves, access, to, resources, and, breeding, opportunities, one, of, its, most, common, functions, is, to, establish, a, dominance, hierarchy, this, occurs, in, many, species, by, aggressive, encounters, between, contending, males, when, they, are, first, together, in, a, common, environment, usually, the, more, aggressive, animals, become, the, more, dominant, in, test, situations, most, of, the, conspecific, aggression, ceases, about, 24, hours, after, the, group, of, animals, is, brought, together, aggression, has, been, defined, from, this, viewpoint, as, behavior, which, is, intended, to, increase, the, social, dominance, of, the, organism, relative, to, the, dominance, position, of, other, organisms, losing, confrontations, may, be, called, social, defeat, and, winning, or, losing, is, associated, with, a, range, of, practical, and, psychological, consequences, conflicts, between, animals, occur, in, many, contexts, such, as, between, potential, mating, partners, between, parents, and, offspring, between, siblings, and, between, competitors, for, resources, group, living, animals, may, dispute, over, the, direction, of, travel, or, the, allocation, of, time, to, joint, activities, various, factors, limit, the, escalation, of, aggression, including, communicative, displays, conventions, and, routines, in, addition, following, aggressive, incidents, various, forms, of, conflict, resolution, have, been, observed, in, mammalian, species, particularly, in, gregarious, primates, these, can, mitigate, or, repair, possible, adverse, consequences, especially, for, the, recipient, of, aggression, who, may, become, vulnerable, to, attacks, by, other, members, of, a, group, conciliatory, acts, vary, by, species, and, may, involve, specific, gestures, or, simply, more, proximity, and, interaction, between, the, individuals, involved, however, conflicts, over, food, are, rarely, followed, by, post, conflict, reunions, even, though, they, are, the, most, frequent, type, in, foraging, primates, other, questions, that, have, been, considered, in, the, study, of, primate, aggression, including, in, humans, is, how, aggression, affects, the, organization, of, a, group, what, costs, are, incurred, by, aggression, and, why, some, primates, avoid, aggressive, behavior, for, example, bonobo, chimpanzee, groups, are, known, for, low, levels, of, aggression, within, a, partially, matriarchal, society, captive, animals, including, primates, may, show, abnormal, levels, of, social, aggression, and, self, harm, that, are, related, to, aspects, of, the, physical, or, social, environment, this, depends, on, the, species, and, individual, factors, such, as, gender, age, and, background, e, g, raised, wild, or, captive, within, ethology, it, has, long, been, recognized, that, there, is, a, relation, between, aggression, fear, and, curiosity, a, cognitive, approach, to, this, relationship, puts, aggression, in, the, broader, context, of, inconsistency, reduction, and, proposes, that, aggressive, behavior, is, caused, by, an, inconsistency, between, a, desired, or, expected, situation, and, the, actually, perceived, situation, e, g, frustration, and, functions, to, forcefully, manipulate, the, perception, into, matching, the, expected, situation, in, this, approach, when, the, inconsistency, between, perception, and, expectancy, is, small, learning, as, a, result, of, curiosity, reduces, inconsistency, by, updating, expectancy, to, match, perception, if, the, inconsistency, is, larger, fear, or, aggressive, behavior, may, be, employed, to, alter, the, perception, in, order, to, make, it, match, expectancy, depending, on, the, size, of, the, inconsistency, as, well, as, the, specific, context, uninhibited, fear, results, in, fleeing, thereby, removing, the, inconsistent, stimulus, from, the, perceptual, field, and, resolving, the, inconsistency, in, some, cases, thwarted, escape, may, trigger, aggressive, behavior, in, an, attempt, to, remove, the, thwarting, stimulus, like, many, behaviors, aggression, can, be, examined, in, terms, of, its, ability, to, help, an, animal, itself, survive, and, reproduce, or, alternatively, to, risk, survival, and, reproduction, this, cost, benefit, analysis, can, be, looked, at, in, terms, of, evolution, however, there, are, profound, differences, in, the, extent, of, acceptance, of, a, biological, or, evolutionary, basis, for, human, aggression, according, to, the, male, warrior, hypothesis, intergroup, aggression, represents, an, opportunity, for, men, to, gain, access, to, mates, territory, resources, and, increased, status, as, such, conflicts, may, have, created, selection, evolutionary, pressures, for, psychological, mechanisms, in, men, to, initiate, intergroup, aggression, aggression, can, involve, violence, that, may, be, adaptive, under, certain, circumstances, in, terms, of, natural, selection, this, is, most, obviously, the, case, in, terms, of, attacking, prey, to, obtain, food, or, in, anti, predatory, defense, it, may, also, be, the, case, in, competition, between, members, of, the, same, species, or, subgroup, if, the, average, reward, e, g, status, access, to, resources, protection, of, self, or, kin, outweighs, average, costs, e, g, injury, exclusion, from, the, group, death, there, are, some, hypotheses, of, specific, adaptions, for, violence, in, humans, under, certain, circumstances, including, for, homicide, but, it, is, often, unclear, what, behaviors, may, have, been, selected, for, and, what, may, have, been, a, byproduct, as, in, the, case, of, collective, violence, although, aggressive, encounters, are, ubiquitous, in, the, animal, kingdom, with, often, high, stakes, most, encounters, that, involve, aggression, may, be, resolved, through, posturing, or, displaying, and, trial, of, strength, game, theory, is, used, to, understand, how, such, behaviors, might, spread, by, natural, selection, within, a, population, and, potentially, become, evolutionary, stable, strategies, an, initial, model, of, resolution, of, conflicts, is, the, hawk, dove, game, others, include, the, sequential, assessment, model, and, the, energetic, war, of, attrition, these, try, to, understand, not, just, one, off, encounters, but, protracted, stand, offs, and, mainly, differ, in, the, criteria, by, which, an, individual, decides, to, give, up, rather, than, risk, loss, and, harm, in, physical, conflict, such, as, through, estimates, of, resource, holding, potential, gender, plays, an, important, role, in, human, aggression, there, are, multiple, theories, that, seek, to, explain, findings, that, males, and, females, of, the, same, species, can, have, differing, aggressive, behaviors, one, review, concluded, that, male, aggression, tended, to, produce, pain, or, physical, injury, whereas, female, aggression, tended, towards, psychological, or, social, harm, in, general, sexual, dimorphism, can, be, attributed, to, greater, intraspecific, competition, in, one, sex, either, between, rivals, for, access, to, mates, and, or, to, be, chosen, by, mates, this, may, stem, from, the, other, gender, being, constrained, by, providing, greater, parental, investment, in, terms, of, factors, such, as, gamete, production, gestation, lactation, or, upbringing, of, young, although, there, is, much, variation, in, species, generally, the, more, physically, aggressive, sex, is, the, male, particularly, in, mammals, in, species, where, parental, care, by, both, sexes, is, required, there, tends, to, be, less, of, a, difference, when, the, female, can, leave, the, male, to, care, for, the, offspring, then, females, may, be, the, larger, and, more, physically, aggressive, competitiveness, despite, parental, investment, has, also, been, observed, in, some, species, a, related, factor, is, the, rate, at, which, males, and, females, are, able, to, mate, again, after, producing, offspring, and, the, basic, principles, of, sexual, selection, are, also, influenced, by, ecological, factors, affecting, the, ways, or, extent, to, which, one, sex, can, compete, for, the, other, the, role, of, such, factors, in, human, evolution, is, controversial, the, pattern, of, male, and, female, aggression, is, argued, to, be, consistent, with, evolved, sexually, selected, behavioral, differences, while, alternative, or, complementary, views, emphasize, conventional, social, roles, stemming, from, physical, evolved, differences, aggression, in, women, may, have, evolved, to, be, on, average, less, physically, dangerous, and, more, covert, or, indirect, however, there, are, critiques, for, using, animal, behavior, to, explain, human, behavior, especially, in, the, application, of, evolutionary, explanations, to, contemporary, human, behavior, including, differences, between, the, genders, according, to, the, 2015, international, encyclopedia, of, the, social, behavioral, sciences, sex, differences, in, aggression, is, one, of, the, most, robust, and, oldest, findings, in, psychology, past, meta, analyses, in, the, encyclopedia, found, males, regardless, of, age, engaged, in, more, physical, and, verbal, aggression, while, small, effect, for, females, engaging, in, more, indirect, aggression, such, as, rumor, spreading, or, gossiping, it, also, found, males, tend, to, engage, in, more, unprovoked, aggression, at, higher, frequency, than, females, this, analysis, also, conforms, with, the, oxford, handbook, of, evolutionary, psychology, which, reviewed, past, analysis, which, found, men, to, use, more, verbal, and, physical, aggression, with, the, difference, being, greater, in, the, physical, type, there, are, more, recent, findings, that, show, that, differences, in, male, and, female, aggression, appear, at, about, two, years, of, age, though, the, differences, in, aggression, are, more, consistent, in, middle, aged, children, and, adolescence, tremblay, japel, and, p, russe, 1999, asserted, that, physically, aggressive, behaviors, such, as, kicking, biting, and, hitting, are, age, typical, expressions, of, innate, and, spontaneous, reactions, to, biological, drives, such, as, anger, hunger, and, affiliation, girls, relational, aggression, meaning, non, physical, or, indirect, tends, to, increase, after, age, two, while, physical, aggression, decreases, there, was, no, significant, difference, in, aggression, between, males, and, females, before, two, years, of, age, a, possible, explanation, for, this, could, be, that, girls, develop, language, skills, more, quickly, than, boys, and, therefore, have, better, ways, of, verbalizing, their, wants, and, needs, they, are, more, likely, to, use, communication, when, trying, to, retrieve, a, toy, with, the, words, ask, nicely, or, say, please, according, to, the, journal, of, aggressive, behaviour, an, analysis, across, 9, countries, found, boys, reported, more, in, the, use, of, physical, aggression, at, the, same, time, no, consistent, sex, differences, emerged, within, relational, aggression, it, has, been, found, that, girls, are, more, likely, than, boys, to, use, reactive, aggression, and, then, retract, but, boys, are, more, likely, to, increase, rather, than, to, retract, their, aggression, after, their, first, reaction, studies, show, girls, aggressive, tactics, included, gossip, ostracism, breaking, confidences, and, criticism, of, a, victim, s, clothing, appearance, or, personality, whereas, boys, engage, in, aggression, that, involves, a, direct, physical, and, or, verbal, assault, this, could, be, due, to, the, fact, that, girls, frontal, lobes, develop, earlier, than, boys, allowing, them, to, self, restrain, one, factor, that, shows, insignificant, differences, between, male, and, female, aggression, is, in, sports, in, sports, the, rate, of, aggression, in, both, contact, and, non, contact, sports, is, relatively, equal, since, the, establishment, of, title, ix, female, sports, have, increased, in, competitiveness, and, importance, which, could, contribute, to, the, evening, of, aggression, and, the, need, to, win, attitude, between, both, genders, among, sex, differences, found, in, adult, sports, were, that, females, have, a, higher, scale, of, indirect, hostility, while, men, have, a, higher, scale, of, assault, another, difference, found, is, that, men, have, up, to, 20, times, higher, levels, of, testosterone, than, women, some, studies, suggest, that, romantic, involvement, in, adolescence, decreases, aggression, in, males, and, females, but, decreases, at, a, higher, rate, in, females, females, will, seem, more, desirable, to, their, mate, if, they, fit, in, with, society, and, females, that, are, aggressive, do, not, usually, fit, well, in, society, they, can, often, be, viewed, as, antisocial, female, aggression, is, not, considered, the, norm, in, society, and, going, against, the, norm, can, sometimes, prevent, one, from, getting, a, mate, however, studies, have, shown, that, an, increasing, number, of, women, are, getting, arrested, on, domestic, violence, charges, in, many, states, women, now, account, for, a, quarter, to, a, third, of, all, domestic, violence, arrests, up, from, less, than, 10, percent, a, decade, ago, the, new, statistics, reflect, a, reality, documented, in, research, women, are, perpetrators, as, well, as, victims, of, family, violence, however, another, equally, possible, explanation, is, a, case, of, improved, diagnostics, it, has, become, more, acceptable, for, men, to, report, female, domestic, violence, to, the, authorities, while, at, the, same, time, actual, female, domestic, violence, has, not, increased, at, all, this, could, be, the, case, in, a, situation, where, men, had, become, less, ashamed, of, reporting, female, violence, against, them, such, a, situation, could, conceivably, lead, to, an, increasing, number, of, women, being, arrested, despite, the, actual, number, of, violent, women, remaining, the, same, in, addition, males, in, competitive, sports, are, often, advised, by, their, coaches, not, to, be, in, intimate, relationships, based, on, the, premises, that, they, become, more, docile, and, less, aggressive, during, an, athletic, event, the, circumstances, in, which, males, and, females, experience, aggression, are, also, different, a, study, showed, that, social, anxiety, and, stress, was, positively, correlated, with, aggression, in, males, meaning, as, stress, and, social, anxiety, increases, so, does, aggression, furthermore, a, male, with, higher, social, skills, has, a, lower, rate, of, aggressive, behavior, than, a, male, with, lower, social, skills, in, females, higher, rates, of, aggression, were, only, correlated, with, higher, rates, of, stress, other, than, biological, factors, that, contribute, to, aggression, there, are, physical, factors, as, well, regarding, sexual, dimorphism, humans, fall, into, an, intermediate, group, with, moderate, sex, differences, in, body, size, but, relatively, large, testes, this, is, a, typical, pattern, of, primates, where, several, males, and, females, live, together, in, a, group, and, the, male, faces, an, intermediate, number, of, challenges, from, other, males, compared, to, exclusive, polygyny, and, monogamy, but, frequent, sperm, competition, evolutionary, psychology, and, sociobiology, have, also, discussed, and, produced, theories, for, some, specific, forms, of, male, aggression, such, as, sociobiological, theories, of, rape, and, theories, regarding, the, cinderella, effect, another, evolutionary, theory, explaining, gender, differences, in, aggression, is, the, male, warrior, hypothesis, which, explains, that, males, have, psychologically, evolved, for, intergroup, aggression, in, order, to, gain, access, to, mates, resources, territory, and, status, many, researchers, focus, on, the, brain, to, explain, aggression, numerous, circuits, within, both, neocortical, and, subcortical, structures, play, a, central, role, in, controlling, aggressive, behavior, depending, on, the, species, and, the, exact, role, of, pathways, may, vary, depending, on, the, type, of, trigger, or, intention, in, mammals, the, hypothalamus, and, periaqueductal, gray, of, the, midbrain, are, critical, areas, as, shown, in, studies, on, cats, rats, and, monkeys, these, brain, areas, control, the, expression, of, both, behavioral, and, autonomic, components, of, aggression, in, these, species, including, vocalization, electrical, stimulation, of, the, hypothalamus, causes, aggressive, behavior, and, the, hypothalamus, has, receptors, that, help, determine, aggression, levels, based, on, their, interactions, with, serotonin, and, vasopressin, in, rodents, activation, of, estrogen, receptor, expressing, neurons, in, the, ventrolateral, portion, of, the, ventromedial, hypothalamus, vmhvl, was, found, to, be, sufficient, to, initiate, aggression, in, both, males, and, females, midbrain, areas, involved, in, aggression, have, direct, connections, with, both, the, brainstem, nuclei, controlling, these, functions, and, with, structures, such, as, the, amygdala, and, prefrontal, cortex, stimulation, of, the, amygdala, results, in, augmented, aggressive, behavior, in, hamsters, while, lesions, of, an, evolutionarily, homologous, area, in, the, lizard, greatly, reduce, competitive, drive, and, aggression, bauman, et, al, 2006, in, rhesus, monkeys, neonatal, lesions, in, the, amygdala, or, hippocampus, results, in, reduced, expression, of, social, dominance, related, to, the, regulation, of, aggression, and, fear, several, experiments, in, attack, primed, syrian, golden, hamsters, for, example, support, the, claim, of, circuitry, within, the, amygdala, being, involved, in, control, of, aggression, the, role, of, the, amygdala, is, less, clear, in, primates, and, appears, to, depend, more, on, situational, context, with, lesions, leading, to, increases, in, either, social, affiliatory, or, aggressive, responses, amygdalotomy, which, involves, removing, or, destroying, parts, of, the, amygdala, has, been, performed, on, people, to, reduce, their, violent, behaviour, the, broad, area, of, the, cortex, known, as, the, prefrontal, cortex, pfc, is, crucial, for, self, control, and, inhibition, of, impulses, including, inhibition, of, aggression, and, emotions, reduced, activity, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, in, particular, its, medial, and, orbitofrontal, portions, has, been, associated, with, violent, antisocial, aggression, in, addition, reduced, response, inhibition, has, been, found, in, violent, offenders, compared, to, non, violent, offenders, the, role, of, the, chemicals, in, the, brain, particularly, neurotransmitters, in, aggression, has, also, been, examined, this, varies, depending, on, the, pathway, the, context, and, other, factors, such, as, gender, a, deficit, in, serotonin, has, been, theorized, to, have, a, primary, role, in, causing, impulsivity, and, aggression, at, least, one, epigenetic, study, supports, this, supposition, nevertheless, low, levels, of, serotonin, transmission, may, explain, a, vulnerability, to, impulsiveness, potential, aggression, and, may, have, an, effect, through, interactions, with, other, neurochemical, systems, these, include, dopamine, systems, which, are, generally, associated, with, attention, and, motivation, toward, rewards, and, operate, at, various, levels, norepinephrine, also, known, as, noradrenaline, may, influence, aggression, responses, both, directly, and, indirectly, through, the, hormonal, system, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, or, the, central, nervous, system, including, the, brain, it, appears, to, have, different, effects, depending, on, the, type, of, triggering, stimulus, for, example, social, isolation, rank, versus, shock, chemical, agitation, which, appears, not, to, have, a, linear, relationship, with, aggression, similarly, gaba, although, associated, with, inhibitory, functions, at, many, cns, synapses, sometimes, shows, a, positive, correlation, with, aggression, including, when, potentiated, by, alcohol, the, hormonal, neuropeptides, vasopressin, and, oxytocin, play, a, key, role, in, complex, social, behaviours, in, many, mammals, such, as, regulating, attachment, social, recognition, and, aggression, vasopressin, has, been, implicated, in, male, typical, social, behaviors, which, includes, aggression, oxytocin, may, have, a, particular, role, in, regulating, female, bonds, with, offspring, and, mates, including, the, use, of, protective, aggression, initial, studies, in, humans, suggest, some, similar, effects, in, human, aggressive, behavior, has, been, associated, with, abnormalities, in, three, principal, regulatory, systems, in, the, body, serotonin, systems, catecholamine, systems, and, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, abnormalities, in, these, systems, also, are, known, to, be, induced, by, stress, either, severe, acute, stress, or, chronic, low, grade, stress, early, androgenization, has, an, organizational, effect, on, the, developing, brains, of, both, males, and, females, making, more, neural, circuits, that, control, sexual, behavior, as, well, as, intermale, and, interfemale, aggression, become, more, sensitive, to, testosterone, there, are, noticeable, sex, differences, in, aggression, testosterone, is, present, to, a, lesser, extent, in, females, who, may, be, more, sensitive, to, its, effects, animal, studies, have, also, indicated, a, link, between, incidents, of, aggression, and, the, individual, level, of, circulating, testosterone, however, results, in, relation, to, primates, particularly, humans, are, less, clear, cut, and, are, at, best, only, suggestive, of, a, positive, association, in, some, contexts, in, humans, there, is, a, seasonal, variation, in, aggression, associated, with, changes, in, testosterone, for, example, in, some, primate, species, such, as, rhesus, monkeys, and, baboons, females, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, fights, around, the, time, of, ovulation, as, well, as, right, before, menstruation, if, the, results, were, the, same, in, humans, as, they, are, in, rhesus, monkeys, and, baboons, then, the, increase, in, aggressive, behaviors, during, ovulation, is, explained, by, the, decline, in, estrogen, levels, this, makes, normal, testosterone, levels, more, effective, castrated, mice, and, rats, exhibit, lower, levels, of, aggression, males, castrated, as, neonates, exhibit, low, levels, of, aggression, even, when, given, testosterone, throughout, their, development, the, challenge, hypothesis, outlines, the, dynamic, relationship, between, plasma, testosterone, levels, and, aggression, in, mating, contexts, in, many, species, it, proposes, that, testosterone, is, linked, to, aggression, when, it, is, beneficial, for, reproduction, such, as, in, mate, guarding, and, preventing, the, encroachment, of, intrasexual, rivals, the, challenge, hypothesis, predicts, that, seasonal, patterns, in, testosterone, levels, in, a, species, are, a, function, of, mating, system, monogamy, versus, polygyny, paternal, care, and, male, male, aggression, in, seasonal, breeders, this, pattern, between, testosterone, and, aggression, was, first, observed, in, seasonally, breeding, birds, such, as, the, song, sparrow, where, testosterone, levels, rise, modestly, with, the, onset, of, the, breeding, season, to, support, basic, reproductive, functions, the, hypothesis, has, been, subsequently, expanded, and, modified, to, predict, relationships, between, testosterone, and, aggression, in, other, species, for, example, chimpanzees, which, are, continuous, breeders, show, significantly, raised, testosterone, levels, and, aggressive, male, male, interactions, when, receptive, and, fertile, females, are, present, currently, no, research, has, specified, a, relationship, between, the, modified, challenge, hypothesis, and, human, behavior, or, the, human, nature, of, concealed, ovulation, although, some, suggest, it, may, apply, another, line, of, research, has, focused, on, the, proximate, effects, of, circulating, testosterone, on, the, nervous, system, as, mediated, by, local, metabolism, within, the, brain, testosterone, can, be, metabolized, to, estradiol, by, the, enzyme, aromatase, or, to, dihydrotestosterone, dht, by, 5, reductase, aromatase, is, highly, expressed, in, regions, involved, in, the, regulation, of, aggressive, behavior, such, as, the, amygdala, and, hypothalamus, in, studies, using, genetic, knockout, techniques, in, inbred, mice, male, mice, that, lacked, a, functional, aromatase, enzyme, displayed, a, marked, reduction, in, aggression, long, term, treatment, with, estradiol, partially, restored, aggressive, behavior, suggesting, that, the, neural, conversion, of, circulating, testosterone, to, estradiol, and, its, effect, on, estrogen, receptors, influences, inter, male, aggression, in, addition, two, different, estrogen, receptors, er, and, er, have, been, identified, as, having, the, ability, to, exert, different, effects, on, aggression, in, mice, however, the, effect, of, estradiol, appears, to, vary, depending, on, the, strain, of, mouse, and, in, some, strains, it, reduces, aggression, during, long, days, 16, h, of, light, while, during, short, days, 8, h, of, light, estradiol, rapidly, increases, aggression, another, hypothesis, is, that, testosterone, influences, brain, areas, that, control, behavioral, reactions, studies, in, animal, models, indicate, that, aggression, is, affected, by, several, interconnected, cortical, and, subcortical, structures, within, the, so, called, social, behavior, network, a, study, involving, lesions, and, electrical, chemical, stimulation, in, rodents, and, cats, revealed, that, such, a, neural, network, consists, of, the, medial, amygdala, medial, hypothalamus, and, periaqueductal, grey, pag, and, it, positively, modulates, reactive, aggression, moreover, a, study, done, in, human, subjects, showed, that, prefrontal, amygdala, connectivity, is, modulated, by, endogenous, testosterone, during, social, emotional, behavior, in, human, studies, testosterone, aggression, research, has, also, focused, on, the, role, of, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, ofc, this, brain, area, is, strongly, associated, with, impulse, control, and, self, regulation, systems, that, integrate, emotion, motivation, and, cognition, to, guide, context, appropriate, behavior, patients, with, localized, lesions, to, the, ofc, engage, in, heightened, reactive, aggression, aggressive, behavior, may, be, regulated, by, testosterone, via, reduced, medial, ofc, engagement, following, social, provocation, when, measuring, participants, salivary, testosterone, higher, levels, can, predict, subsequent, aggressive, behavioral, reactions, to, unfairness, faced, during, a, task, moreover, brain, scanning, with, fmri, shows, reduced, activity, in, the, medial, ofc, during, such, reactions, such, findings, may, suggest, that, a, specific, brain, region, the, ofc, is, a, key, factor, in, understanding, reactive, aggression, scientists, have, for, a, long, time, been, interested, in, the, relationship, between, testosterone, and, aggressive, behavior, in, most, species, males, are, more, aggressive, than, females, castration, of, males, usually, has, a, pacifying, effect, on, aggressive, behavior, in, males, in, humans, males, engage, in, crime, and, especially, violent, crime, more, than, females, the, involvement, in, crime, usually, rises, in, the, early, teens, to, mid, teens, which, happen, at, the, same, time, as, testosterone, levels, rise, research, on, the, relationship, between, testosterone, and, aggression, is, difficult, since, the, only, reliable, measurement, of, brain, testosterone, is, by, a, lumbar, puncture, which, is, not, done, for, research, purposes, studies, therefore, have, often, instead, used, more, unreliable, measurements, from, blood, or, saliva, the, handbook, of, crime, correlates, a, review, of, crime, studies, states, most, studies, support, a, link, between, adult, criminality, and, testosterone, although, the, relationship, is, modest, if, examined, separately, for, each, sex, however, nearly, all, studies, of, juvenile, delinquency, and, testosterone, are, not, significant, most, studies, have, also, found, testosterone, to, be, associated, with, behaviors, or, personality, traits, linked, with, criminality, such, as, antisocial, behavior, and, alcoholism, many, studies, have, also, been, done, on, the, relationship, between, more, general, aggressive, behavior, feelings, and, testosterone, about, half, the, studies, have, found, a, relationship, and, about, half, no, relationship, studies, of, testosterone, levels, of, male, athletes, before, and, after, a, competition, revealed, that, testosterone, levels, rise, shortly, before, their, matches, as, if, in, anticipation, of, the, competition, and, are, dependent, on, the, outcome, of, the, event, testosterone, levels, of, winners, are, high, relative, to, those, of, losers, no, specific, response, of, testosterone, levels, to, competition, was, observed, in, female, athletes, although, a, mood, difference, was, noted, in, addition, some, experiments, have, failed, to, find, a, relationship, between, testosterone, levels, and, aggression, in, humans, the, possible, correlation, between, testosterone, and, aggression, could, explain, the, roid, rage, that, can, result, from, anabolic, steroid, use, although, an, effect, of, abnormally, high, levels, of, steroids, does, not, prove, an, effect, at, physiological, levels, dehydroepiandrosterone, dhea, is, the, most, abundant, circulating, androgen, hormone, and, can, be, rapidly, metabolized, within, target, tissues, into, potent, androgens, and, estrogens, gonadal, steroids, generally, regulate, aggression, during, the, breeding, season, but, non, gonadal, steroids, may, regulate, aggression, during, the, non, breeding, season, castration, of, various, species, in, the, non, breeding, season, has, no, effect, on, territorial, aggression, in, several, avian, studies, circulating, dhea, has, been, found, to, be, elevated, in, birds, during, the, non, breeding, season, these, data, support, the, idea, that, non, breeding, birds, combine, adrenal, and, or, gonadal, dhea, synthesis, with, neural, dhea, metabolism, to, maintain, territorial, behavior, when, gonadal, testosterone, secretion, is, low, similar, results, have, been, found, in, studies, involving, different, strains, of, rats, mice, and, hamsters, dhea, levels, also, have, been, studied, in, humans, and, may, play, a, role, in, human, aggression, circulating, dheas, its, sulfated, ester, levels, rise, during, adrenarche, 7, years, of, age, while, plasma, testosterone, levels, are, relatively, low, this, implies, that, aggression, in, pre, pubertal, children, with, aggressive, conduct, disorder, might, be, correlated, with, plasma, dheas, rather, than, plasma, testosterone, suggesting, an, important, link, between, dheas, and, human, aggressive, behavior, glucocorticoid, hormones, have, an, important, role, in, regulating, aggressive, behavior, in, adult, rats, acute, injections, of, corticosterone, promote, aggressive, behavior, and, acute, reduction, of, corticosterone, decreases, aggression, however, a, chronic, reduction, of, corticosterone, levels, can, produce, abnormally, aggressive, behavior, in, addition, glucocorticoids, affect, development, of, aggression, and, establishment, of, social, hierarchies, adult, mice, with, low, baseline, levels, of, corticosterone, are, more, likely, to, become, dominant, than, are, mice, with, high, baseline, corticosterone, levels, glucocorticoids, are, released, by, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, hpa, axis, in, response, to, stress, of, which, cortisol, is, the, most, prominent, in, humans, results, in, adults, suggest, that, reduced, levels, of, cortisol, linked, to, lower, fear, or, a, reduced, stress, response, can, be, associated, with, more, aggression, however, it, may, be, that, proactive, aggression, is, associated, with, low, cortisol, levels, while, reactive, aggression, may, be, accompanied, by, elevated, levels, differences, in, assessments, of, cortisol, may, also, explain, a, diversity, of, results, particularly, in, children, the, hpa, axis, is, related, to, the, general, fight, or, flight, response, or, acute, stress, reaction, and, the, role, of, catecholamines, such, as, epinephrine, popularly, known, as, adrenaline, in, many, animals, aggression, can, be, linked, to, pheromones, released, between, conspecifics, in, mice, major, urinary, proteins, mups, have, been, demonstrated, to, promote, innate, aggressive, behavior, in, males, and, can, be, mediated, by, neuromodulatory, systems, mups, activate, olfactory, sensory, neurons, in, the, vomeronasal, organ, vno, a, subsystem, of, the, nose, known, to, detect, pheromones, via, specific, sensory, receptors, of, mice, and, rats, pheremones, have, also, been, identified, in, fruit, flies, detected, by, neurons, in, the, antenna, that, send, a, message, to, the, brain, eliciting, aggression, it, has, been, noted, that, aggression, pheremones, have, not, been, identified, in, humans, in, general, differences, in, a, continuous, phenotype, such, as, aggression, are, likely, to, result, from, the, action, of, a, large, number, of, genes, each, of, small, effect, which, interact, with, each, other, and, the, environment, through, development, and, life, in, a, non, mammalian, example, of, genes, related, to, aggression, the, fruitless, gene, in, fruit, flies, is, a, critical, determinant, of, certain, sexually, dimorphic, behaviors, and, its, artificial, alteration, can, result, in, a, reversal, of, stereotypically, male, and, female, patterns, of, aggression, in, fighting, however, in, what, was, thought, to, be, a, relatively, clear, case, inherent, complexities, have, been, reported, in, deciphering, the, connections, between, interacting, genes, in, an, environmental, context, and, a, social, phenotype, involving, multiple, behavioral, and, sensory, interactions, with, another, organism, in, mice, candidate, genes, for, differentiating, aggression, between, the, sexes, are, the, sry, sex, determining, region, y, gene, located, on, the, y, chromosome, and, the, sts, steroid, sulfatase, gene, the, sts, gene, encodes, the, steroid, sulfatase, enzyme, which, is, pivotal, in, the, regulation, of, neurosteroid, biosynthesis, it, is, expressed, in, both, sexes, is, correlated, with, levels, of, aggression, among, male, mice, and, increases, dramatically, in, females, after, parturition, and, during, lactation, corresponding, to, the, onset, of, maternal, aggression, at, least, one, study, has, found, a, possible, epigenetic, signature, i, e, decreased, methylation, at, a, specific, cpg, site, on, the, promoter, region, of, the, serotonin, receptor, 5, ht3a, that, is, associated, with, maternal, aggression, among, human, subjects, mice, with, experimentally, elevated, sensitivity, to, oxidative, stress, through, inhibition, of, copper, zinc, superoxide, dismutase, sod1, activity, were, tested, for, aggressive, behavior, males, completely, deficient, in, sod1, were, found, to, be, more, aggressive, than, both, wild, type, males, and, males, that, express, 50, of, this, antioxidant, enzyme, they, were, also, faster, to, attack, another, male, the, causal, connection, between, sod1, deficiency, and, increased, aggression, is, not, yet, understood, in, humans, there, is, good, evidence, that, the, basic, human, neural, architecture, underpinning, the, potential, for, flexible, aggressive, responses, is, influenced, by, genes, as, well, as, environment, in, terms, of, variation, between, individual, people, more, than, 100, twin, and, adoption, studies, have, been, conducted, in, recent, decades, examining, the, genetic, basis, of, aggressive, behavior, and, related, constructs, such, as, conduct, disorders, according, to, a, meta, analysis, published, in, 2002, approximately, 40, of, variation, between, individuals, is, explained, by, differences, in, genes, and, 60, by, differences, in, environment, mainly, non, shared, environmental, influences, rather, than, those, that, would, be, shared, by, being, raised, together, however, such, studies, have, depended, on, self, report, or, observation, by, others, including, parents, which, complicates, interpretation, of, the, results, the, few, laboratory, based, analyses, have, not, found, significant, amounts, of, individual, variation, in, aggression, explicable, by, genetic, variation, in, the, human, population, furthermore, linkage, and, association, studies, that, seek, to, identify, specific, genes, for, example, that, influence, neurotransmitter, or, hormone, levels, have, generally, resulted, in, contradictory, findings, characterized, by, failed, attempts, at, replication, one, possible, factor, is, an, allele, variant, of, the, mao, a, gene, which, in, interaction, with, certain, life, events, such, as, childhood, maltreatment, which, may, show, a, main, effect, on, its, own, can, influence, development, of, brain, regions, such, as, the, amygdala, and, as, a, result, some, types, of, behavioral, response, may, be, more, likely, the, generally, unclear, picture, has, been, compared, to, equally, difficult, findings, obtained, in, regard, to, other, complex, behavioral, phenotypes, for, example, both, 7r, and, 5r, adhd, linked, vntr, alleles, of, dopamine, receptor, d4, gene, are, directly, associated, with, the, incidence, of, proactive, aggression, in, the, men, with, no, history, of, adhd, humans, share, aspects, of, aggression, with, non, human, animals, and, have, specific, aspects, and, complexity, related, to, factors, such, as, genetics, early, development, social, learning, and, flexibility, culture, and, morals, konrad, lorenz, stated, in, his, 1963, classic, on, aggression, that, human, behavior, is, shaped, by, four, main, survival, seeking, animal, drives, taken, together, these, drives, hunger, fear, reproduction, and, aggression, achieve, natural, selection, e, o, wilson, elaborated, in, on, human, nature, that, aggression, is, typically, a, means, of, gaining, control, over, resources, aggression, is, thus, aggravated, during, times, when, high, population, densities, generate, resource, shortages, according, to, richard, leakey, and, his, colleagues, aggression, in, humans, has, also, increased, by, becoming, more, interested, in, ownership, and, by, defending, his, or, her, property, however, unesco, adopted, the, seville, statement, of, violence, in, 1989, that, refuted, claims, by, evolutionary, scientists, that, genetics, by, itself, was, the, sole, cause, of, aggression, social, and, cultural, aspects, may, significantly, interfere, with, the, distinct, expression, of, aggressiveness, for, example, a, high, population, density, when, associated, with, a, decrease, of, available, resources, might, be, a, significant, intervening, variable, for, the, occurrence, of, violent, acts, culture, is, one, factor, that, plays, a, role, in, aggression, tribal, or, band, societies, existing, before, or, outside, of, modern, states, have, sometimes, been, depicted, as, peaceful, noble, savages, the, kung, people, were, described, as, the, harmless, people, in, a, popular, work, by, elizabeth, marshall, thomas, in, 1958, while, lawrence, keeley, s, 1996, war, before, civilization, suggested, that, regular, warfare, without, modern, technology, was, conducted, by, most, groups, throughout, human, history, including, most, native, american, tribes, studies, of, hunter, gatherers, show, a, range, of, different, societies, in, general, aggression, conflict, and, violence, sometimes, occur, but, direct, confrontation, is, generally, avoided, and, conflict, is, socially, managed, by, a, variety, of, verbal, and, non, verbal, methods, different, rates, of, aggression, or, violence, currently, or, in, the, past, within, or, between, groups, have, been, linked, to, the, structuring, of, societies, and, environmental, conditions, influencing, factors, such, as, resource, or, property, acquisition, land, and, subsistence, techniques, and, population, change, american, psychologist, peter, gray, hypothesizes, that, band, hunter, gatherer, societies, are, able, to, reduce, aggression, while, maintaining, relatively, peaceful, egalitarian, relations, between, members, through, various, methods, such, as, fostering, a, playful, spirit, in, all, areas, of, life, the, use, of, humor, to, counter, the, tendency, of, any, one, person, to, dominate, the, group, and, non, coercive, or, indulgent, child, rearing, practices, gray, likens, hunter, gatherer, bands, to, social, play, groups, while, stressing, that, such, play, is, not, frivolous, or, even, easy, at, all, times, according, to, gray, social, play, that, is, play, involving, more, than, one, player, is, necessarily, egalitarian, it, always, requires, a, suspension, of, aggression, and, dominance, along, with, a, heightened, sensitivity, to, the, needs, and, desires, of, the, other, players, joan, durrant, at, the, university, of, manitoba, writes, that, a, number, of, studies, have, found, physical, punishment, to, be, associated, with, higher, levels, of, aggression, against, parents, siblings, peers, and, spouses, even, when, controlling, for, other, factors, according, to, elizabeth, gershoff, at, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, the, more, that, children, are, physically, punished, the, more, likely, they, are, as, adults, to, act, violently, towards, family, members, including, intimate, partners, in, countries, where, physical, punishment, of, children, is, perceived, as, being, more, culturally, accepted, it, is, less, strongly, associated, with, increased, aggression, however, physical, punishment, has, been, found, to, predict, some, increase, in, child, aggression, regardless, of, culture, while, these, associations, do, not, prove, causality, a, number, of, longitudinal, studies, suggest, that, the, experience, of, physical, punishment, has, a, direct, causal, effect, on, later, aggressive, behaviors, in, examining, several, longitudinal, studies, that, investigated, the, path, from, disciplinary, spanking, to, aggression, in, children, from, preschool, age, through, adolescence, gershoff, concluded, spanking, consistently, predicted, increases, in, children, s, aggression, over, time, regardless, of, how, aggressive, children, were, when, the, spanking, occurred, similar, results, were, found, by, catherine, taylor, at, tulane, university, in, 2010, family, violence, researcher, murray, a, straus, argues, there, are, many, reasons, this, evidence, has, been, ignored, one, of, the, most, important, is, the, belief, that, spanking, is, more, effective, than, nonviolent, discipline, and, is, therefore, sometimes, necessary, despite, the, risk, of, harmful, side, effects, analyzing, aggression, culturally, or, politically, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, label, aggressive, can, itself, be, used, as, a, way, of, asserting, a, judgement, from, a, particular, point, of, view, whether, a, coercive, or, violent, method, of, social, control, is, perceived, as, aggression, or, as, legitimate, versus, illegitimate, aggression, depends, on, the, position, of, the, relevant, parties, in, relation, to, the, social, order, of, their, culture, this, in, turn, can, relate, to, factors, such, as, norms, for, coordinating, actions, and, dividing, resources, what, is, considered, self, defense, or, provocation, attitudes, towards, outsiders, attitudes, towards, specific, groups, such, as, women, disabled, people, or, those, with, lower, status, the, availability, of, alternative, conflict, resolution, strategies, trade, interdependence, and, collective, security, pacts, fears, and, impulses, and, ultimate, goals, regarding, material, and, social, outcomes, cross, cultural, research, has, found, differences, in, attitudes, towards, aggression, in, different, cultures, in, one, questionnaire, study, of, university, students, in, addition, to, men, overall, justifying, some, types, of, aggression, more, than, women, united, states, respondents, justified, defensive, physical, aggression, more, readily, than, japanese, or, spanish, respondents, whereas, japanese, students, preferred, direct, verbal, aggression, but, not, indirect, more, than, their, american, and, spanish, counterparts, within, american, culture, southern, men, were, shown, in, a, study, on, university, students, to, be, more, affected, and, to, respond, more, aggressively, than, northerners, when, randomly, insulted, after, being, bumped, into, which, was, theoretically, related, to, a, traditional, culture, of, honor, in, the, southern, united, states, or, saving, face, other, cultural, themes, sometimes, applied, to, the, study, of, aggression, include, individualistic, versus, collectivist, styles, which, may, relate, for, example, to, whether, disputes, are, responded, to, with, open, competition, or, by, accommodating, and, avoiding, conflicts, in, a, study, including, 62, countries, school, principals, reported, aggressive, student, behavior, more, often, the, more, individualist, and, hence, less, collectivist, their, country, s, culture, other, comparisons, made, in, relation, to, aggression, or, war, include, democratic, versus, authoritarian, political, systems, and, egalitarian, versus, stratified, societies, the, economic, system, known, as, capitalism, has, been, viewed, by, some, as, reliant, on, the, leveraging, of, human, competitiveness, and, aggression, in, pursuit, of, resources, and, trade, which, has, been, considered, in, both, positive, and, negative, terms, attitudes, about, the, social, acceptability, of, particular, acts, or, targets, of, aggression, are, also, important, factors, this, can, be, highly, controversial, as, for, example, in, disputes, between, religions, or, nation, states, for, example, in, regard, to, the, arab, israeli, conflict, some, scholars, believe, that, behaviors, like, aggression, may, be, partially, learned, by, watching, and, imitating, people, s, behavior, while, other, researchers, have, concluded, that, the, media, may, have, some, small, effects, on, aggression, there, is, also, research, questioning, this, view, for, instance, a, long, term, outcome, study, of, youth, found, no, long, term, relationship, between, playing, violent, video, games, and, youth, violence, or, bullying, one, study, suggested, there, is, a, smaller, effect, of, violent, video, games, on, aggression, than, has, been, found, with, television, violence, on, aggression, this, effect, is, positively, associated, with, type, of, game, violence, and, negatively, associated, to, time, spent, playing, the, games, the, author, concluded, that, insufficient, evidence, exists, to, link, video, game, violence, with, aggression, however, another, study, suggested, links, to, aggressive, behavior, the, frequency, of, physical, aggression, in, humans, peaks, at, around, 2, 3, years, of, age, it, then, declines, gradually, on, average, these, observations, suggest, that, physical, aggression, is, not, only, a, learned, behavior, but, that, development, provides, opportunities, for, the, learning, and, biological, development, of, self, regulation, however, a, small, subset, of, children, fail, to, acquire, all, the, necessary, self, regulatory, abilities, and, tend, to, show, atypical, levels, of, physical, aggression, across, development, they, may, be, at, risk, for, later, violent, behavior, or, conversely, lack, of, aggression, that, may, be, considered, necessary, within, society, however, some, findings, suggest, that, early, aggression, does, not, necessarily, lead, to, aggression, later, on, although, the, course, through, early, childhood, is, an, important, predictor, of, outcomes, in, middle, childhood, in, addition, physical, aggression, that, continues, is, likely, occurring, in, the, context, of, family, adversity, including, socioeconomic, factors, moreover, opposition, and, status, violations, in, childhood, appear, to, be, more, strongly, linked, to, social, problems, in, adulthood, than, simply, aggressive, antisocial, behavior, social, learning, through, interactions, in, early, childhood, has, been, seen, as, a, building, block, for, levels, of, aggression, which, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, development, of, peer, relationships, in, middle, childhood, overall, an, interplay, of, biological, social, and, environmental, factors, can, be, considered, some, research, indicates, that, changes, in, the, weather, can, increase, the, likelihood, of, children, exhibiting, deviant, behavior, the, bobo, doll, experiment, was, conducted, by, albert, bandura, in, 1961, in, this, work, bandura, found, that, children, exposed, to, an, aggressive, adult, model, acted, more, aggressively, than, those, who, were, exposed, to, a, nonaggressive, adult, model, this, experiment, suggests, that, anyone, who, comes, in, contact, with, and, interacts, with, children, can, affect, the, way, they, react, and, handle, situations, gender, is, a, factor, that, plays, a, role, in, both, human, and, animal, aggression, males, are, historically, believed, to, be, generally, more, physically, aggressive, than, females, from, an, early, age, and, men, commit, the, vast, majority, of, murders, buss, 2005, this, is, one, of, the, most, robust, and, reliable, behavioral, sex, differences, and, it, has, been, found, across, many, different, age, groups, and, cultures, however, some, empirical, studies, have, found, the, discrepancy, in, male, and, female, aggression, to, be, more, pronounced, in, childhood, and, the, gender, difference, in, adults, to, be, modest, when, studied, in, an, experimental, context, still, there, is, evidence, that, males, are, quicker, to, aggression, frey, et, al, 2003, and, more, likely, than, females, to, express, their, aggression, physically, when, considering, indirect, forms, of, non, violent, aggression, such, as, relational, aggression, and, social, rejection, some, scientists, argue, that, females, can, be, quite, aggressive, although, female, aggression, is, rarely, expressed, physically, an, exception, is, intimate, partner, violence, that, occurs, among, couples, who, are, engaged, married, or, in, some, other, form, of, intimate, relationship, although, females, are, less, likely, than, males, to, initiate, physical, violence, they, can, express, aggression, by, using, a, variety, of, non, physical, means, exactly, which, method, women, use, to, express, aggression, is, something, that, varies, from, culture, to, culture, on, bellona, island, a, culture, based, on, male, dominance, and, physical, violence, women, tend, to, get, into, conflicts, with, other, women, more, frequently, than, with, men, when, in, conflict, with, males, instead, of, using, physical, means, they, make, up, songs, mocking, the, man, which, spread, across, the, island, and, humiliate, him, if, a, woman, wanted, to, kill, a, man, she, would, either, convince, her, male, relatives, to, kill, him, or, hire, an, assassin, although, these, two, methods, involve, physical, violence, both, are, forms, of, indirect, aggression, since, the, aggressor, herself, avoids, getting, directly, involved, or, putting, herself, in, immediate, physical, danger, see, also, the, sections, on, testosterone, and, evolutionary, explanations, for, gender, differences, above, there, has, been, some, links, between, those, prone, to, violence, and, their, alcohol, use, those, who, are, prone, to, violence, and, use, alcohol, are, more, likely, to, carry, out, violent, acts, alcohol, impairs, judgment, making, people, much, less, cautious, than, they, usually, are, macdonald, et, al, 1996, it, also, disrupts, the, way, information, is, processed, bushman, 1993, 1997, bushman, cooper, 1990, pain, and, discomfort, also, increase, aggression, even, the, simple, act, of, placing, one, s, hands, in, hot, water, can, cause, an, aggressive, response, hot, temperatures, have, been, implicated, as, a, factor, in, a, number, of, studies, one, study, completed, in, the, midst, of, the, civil, rights, movement, found, that, riots, were, more, likely, on, hotter, days, than, cooler, ones, carlsmith, anderson, 1979, students, were, found, to, be, more, aggressive, and, irritable, after, taking, a, test, in, a, hot, classroom, anderson, et, al, 1996, rule, et, al, 1987, drivers, in, cars, without, air, conditioning, were, also, found, to, be, more, likely, to, honk, their, horns, kenrick, macfarlane, 1986, which, is, used, as, a, measure, of, aggression, and, has, shown, links, to, other, factors, such, as, generic, symbols, of, aggression, or, the, visibility, of, other, drivers, frustration, is, another, major, cause, of, aggression, the, frustration, aggression, theory, states, that, aggression, increases, if, a, person, feels, that, he, or, she, is, being, blocked, from, achieving, a, goal, aronson, et, al, 2005, one, study, found, that, the, closeness, to, the, goal, makes, a, difference, the, study, examined, people, waiting, in, line, and, concluded, that, the, 2nd, person, was, more, aggressive, than, the, 12th, one, when, someone, cut, in, line, harris, 1974, unexpected, frustration, may, be, another, factor, in, a, separate, study, to, demonstrate, how, unexpected, frustration, leads, to, increased, aggression, kulik, brown, 1979, selected, a, group, of, students, as, volunteers, to, make, calls, for, charity, donations, one, group, was, told, that, the, people, they, would, call, would, be, generous, and, the, collection, would, be, very, successful, the, other, group, was, given, no, expectations, the, group, that, expected, success, was, more, upset, when, no, one, was, pledging, than, the, group, who, did, not, expect, success, everyone, actually, had, horrible, success, this, research, suggests, that, when, an, expectation, does, not, materialize, successful, collections, unexpected, frustration, arises, which, increases, aggression, there, is, some, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, presence, of, violent, objects, such, as, a, gun, can, trigger, aggression, in, a, study, done, by, leonard, berkowitz, and, anthony, le, page, 1967, college, students, were, made, angry, and, then, left, in, the, presence, of, a, gun, or, badminton, racket, they, were, then, led, to, believe, they, were, delivering, electric, shocks, to, another, student, as, in, the, milgram, experiment, those, who, had, been, in, the, presence, of, the, gun, administered, more, shocks, it, is, possible, that, a, violence, related, stimulus, increases, the, likelihood, of, aggressive, cognitions, by, activating, the, semantic, network, a, new, proposal, links, military, experience, to, anger, and, aggression, developing, aggressive, reactions, and, investigating, these, effects, on, those, possessing, the, traits, of, a, serial, killer, castle, and, hensley, state, the, military, provides, the, social, context, where, servicemen, learn, aggression, violence, and, murder, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, is, also, a, serious, issue, in, the, military, also, believed, to, sometimes, lead, to, aggression, in, soldiers, who, are, suffering, from, what, they, witnessed, in, battle, they, come, back, to, the, civilian, world, and, may, still, be, haunted, by, flashbacks, and, nightmares, causing, severe, stress, in, addition, it, has, been, claimed, that, in, the, rare, minority, who, are, claimed, to, be, inclined, toward, serial, killing, violent, impulses, may, be, reinforced, and, refined, in, war, possibly, creating, more, effective, murderers, some, recent, scholarship, has, questioned, traditional, psychological, conceptualizations, of, aggression, as, universally, negative, most, traditional, psychological, definitions, of, aggression, focus, on, the, harm, to, the, recipient, of, the, aggression, implying, this, is, the, intent, of, the, aggressor, however, this, may, not, always, be, the, case, from, this, alternate, view, although, the, recipient, may, or, may, not, be, harmed, the, perceived, intent, is, to, increase, the, status, of, the, aggressor, not, necessarily, to, harm, the, recipient, such, scholars, contend, that, traditional, definitions, of, aggression, have, no, validity, because, of, how, challenging, it, is, to, study, directly, from, this, view, rather, than, concepts, such, as, assertiveness, aggression, violence, and, criminal, violence, existing, as, distinct, constructs, they, exist, instead, along, a, continuum, with, moderate, levels, of, aggression, being, most, adaptive, such, scholars, do, not, consider, this, a, trivial, difference, noting, that, many, traditional, researchers, aggression, measurements, may, measure, outcomes, lower, down, in, the, continuum, at, levels, which, are, adaptive, yet, they, generalize, their, findings, to, non, adaptive, levels, of, aggression, thus, losing, precision
