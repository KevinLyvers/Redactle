https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language
the, origin, of, language, its, relationship, with, human, evolution, and, its, consequences, have, been, subjects, of, study, for, centuries, scholars, wishing, to, study, the, origins, of, language, must, draw, inferences, from, evidence, such, as, the, fossil, record, archaeological, evidence, contemporary, language, diversity, studies, of, language, acquisition, and, comparisons, between, human, language, and, systems, of, animal, communication, particularly, other, primates, many, argue, that, the, origins, of, language, probably, relate, closely, to, the, origins, of, modern, human, behavior, but, there, is, little, agreement, about, the, facts, and, implications, of, this, connection, the, shortage, of, direct, empirical, evidence, has, caused, many, scholars, to, regard, the, entire, topic, as, unsuitable, for, serious, study, in, 1866, the, linguistic, society, of, paris, banned, any, existing, or, future, debates, on, the, subject, a, prohibition, which, remained, influential, across, much, of, the, western, world, until, late, in, the, twentieth, century, various, hypotheses, have, been, developed, about, how, why, when, and, where, language, might, have, emerged, still, little, more, has, been, universally, agreed, upon, by, 1996, than, over, a, century, and, a, half, ago, when, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, had, provoked, a, surge, of, speculation, on, the, topic, since, the, early, 1990s, however, a, number, of, linguists, archaeologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and, others, have, attempted, to, address, this, issue, with, new, modern, methods, attempts, to, explain, the, origin, of, language, take, a, variety, of, forms, most, linguistic, scholars, as, of, 2024, favor, continuity, based, theories, but, they, vary, in, how, they, hypothesize, language, development, among, those, who, consider, language, as, mostly, innate, some, avoid, speculating, about, specific, precursors, in, nonhuman, primates, stressing, simply, that, the, language, faculty, must, have, evolved, gradually, others, in, this, intellectual, camp, notably, ib, ulb, k, hold, that, language, evolved, not, from, primate, communication, but, from, primate, cognition, which, is, significantly, more, complex, those, who, consider, language, as, learned, socially, such, as, michael, tomasello, consider, it, developing, from, the, cognitively, controlled, aspects, of, primate, communication, mostly, gestural, rather, than, vocal, where, vocal, precursors, are, concerned, many, continuity, theorists, envisage, language, evolving, from, early, human, capacities, for, song, noam, chomsky, a, proponent, of, discontinuity, theory, argues, that, a, single, change, occurred, in, humans, before, we, left, africa, coincident, with, the, great, leap, approximately, 100, 000, years, ago, in, which, a, common, language, faculty, developed, in, a, group, of, humans, and, their, descendants, chomsky, bases, his, argument, on, the, observation, that, any, human, baby, of, any, culture, can, be, raised, in, a, different, culture, and, will, completely, assimilate, the, language, and, behavior, of, the, new, culture, in, which, they, were, raised, this, implies, that, no, major, change, to, the, human, language, faculty, has, occurred, since, we, left, africa, transcending, the, continuity, versus, discontinuity, divide, some, scholars, view, the, emergence, of, language, as, the, consequence, of, some, kind, of, social, transformation, that, by, generating, unprecedented, levels, of, public, trust, liberated, a, genetic, potential, for, linguistic, creativity, that, had, previously, lain, dormant, ritual, speech, coevolution, theory, exemplifies, this, approach, scholars, in, this, intellectual, camp, point, to, the, fact, that, even, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, have, latent, symbolic, capacities, that, they, rarely, if, ever, use, in, the, wild, objecting, to, the, sudden, mutation, idea, these, authors, argue, that, even, if, a, chance, mutation, were, to, install, a, language, organ, in, an, evolving, bipedal, primate, it, would, be, adaptively, useless, under, all, known, primate, social, conditions, a, very, specific, social, structure, one, capable, of, upholding, unusually, high, levels, of, public, accountability, and, trust, must, have, evolved, before, or, concurrently, with, language, to, make, reliance, on, cheap, signals, words, an, evolutionarily, stable, strategy, since, the, emergence, of, language, lies, so, far, back, in, human, prehistory, the, relevant, developments, have, left, no, direct, historical, traces, neither, can, comparable, processes, be, observed, today, despite, this, the, emergence, of, new, sign, languages, in, modern, times, nicaraguan, sign, language, for, example, may, potentially, offer, insights, into, the, developmental, stages, and, creative, processes, necessarily, involved, another, approach, inspects, early, human, fossils, looking, for, traces, of, physical, adaptation, to, language, use, in, some, cases, when, the, dna, of, extinct, humans, can, be, recovered, the, presence, or, absence, of, genes, considered, to, be, language, relevant, foxp2, for, example, may, prove, informative, another, approach, this, time, archaeological, involves, invoking, symbolic, behavior, such, as, repeated, ritual, activity, that, may, leave, an, archaeological, trace, such, as, mining, and, modifying, ochre, pigments, for, body, painting, while, developing, theoretical, arguments, to, justify, inferences, from, symbolism, in, general, to, language, in, particular, the, time, range, for, the, evolution, of, language, or, its, anatomical, prerequisites, extends, at, least, in, principle, from, the, phylogenetic, divergence, of, homo, 2, 3, to, 2, 4, million, years, ago, from, pan, 5, to, 6, million, years, ago, to, the, emergence, of, full, behavioral, modernity, some, 50, 000, 150, 000, years, ago, few, dispute, that, australopithecus, probably, lacked, vocal, communication, significantly, more, sophisticated, than, that, of, great, apes, in, general, but, scholarly, opinions, vary, as, to, the, developments, since, the, appearance, of, homo, some, 2, 5, million, years, ago, some, scholars, assume, the, development, of, primitive, language, like, systems, proto, language, as, early, as, homo, habilis, while, others, place, the, development, of, symbolic, communication, only, with, homo, erectus, 1, 8, million, years, ago, or, with, homo, heidelbergensis, 0, 6, million, years, ago, and, the, development, of, language, proper, with, homo, sapiens, currently, estimated, at, less, than, 200, 000, years, ago, using, statistical, methods, to, estimate, the, time, required, to, achieve, the, current, spread, and, diversity, in, modern, languages, johanna, nichols, a, linguist, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, argued, in, 1998, that, vocal, languages, must, have, begun, diversifying, in, the, human, species, at, least, 100, 000, years, ago, estimates, of, this, kind, are, not, universally, accepted, but, jointly, considering, genetic, archaeological, palaeontological, and, much, other, evidence, indicates, that, language, probably, emerged, somewhere, in, sub, saharan, africa, during, the, middle, stone, age, roughly, contemporaneous, with, the, speciation, of, homo, sapiens, i, cannot, doubt, that, language, owes, its, origin, to, the, imitation, and, modification, aided, by, signs, and, gestures, of, various, natural, sounds, the, voices, of, other, animals, and, man, s, own, instinctive, cries, in, 1861, historical, linguist, max, m, ller, published, a, list, of, speculative, theories, concerning, the, origins, of, spoken, language, most, scholars, today, consider, all, such, theories, not, so, much, wrong, they, occasionally, offer, peripheral, insights, as, na, ve, and, irrelevant, the, problem, with, these, theories, is, that, they, rest, on, the, assumption, that, once, early, humans, had, discovered, a, workable, mechanism, for, linking, sounds, with, meanings, language, would, automatically, have, evolved, much, earlier, medieval, muslim, scholars, developed, theories, on, the, origin, of, language, their, theories, were, of, five, general, types, from, the, perspective, of, signalling, theory, the, main, obstacle, to, the, evolution, of, language, like, communication, in, nature, is, not, a, mechanistic, one, rather, it, is, the, fact, that, symbols, arbitrary, associations, of, sounds, or, other, perceptible, forms, with, corresponding, meanings, are, unreliable, and, may, well, be, false, as, the, saying, goes, words, are, cheap, the, problem, of, reliability, was, not, recognized, at, all, by, darwin, m, ller, or, the, other, early, evolutionary, theorists, animal, vocal, signals, are, for, the, most, part, intrinsically, reliable, when, a, cat, purrs, the, signal, constitutes, direct, evidence, of, the, animal, s, contented, state, the, signal, is, trusted, not, because, the, cat, is, inclined, to, be, honest, but, because, it, just, cannot, fake, that, sound, primate, vocal, calls, may, be, slightly, more, manipulable, but, they, remain, reliable, for, the, same, reason, because, they, are, hard, to, fake, primate, social, intelligence, is, machiavellian, self, serving, and, unconstrained, by, moral, scruples, monkeys, apes, and, humans, often, attempt, to, deceive, each, other, while, at, the, same, time, remaining, constantly, on, guard, against, falling, victim, to, deception, themselves, paradoxically, it, is, theorized, that, primates, resistance, to, deception, is, what, blocks, the, evolution, of, their, signalling, systems, along, language, like, lines, language, is, ruled, out, because, the, best, way, to, guard, against, being, deceived, is, to, ignore, all, signals, except, those, that, are, instantly, verifiable, words, automatically, fail, this, test, words, are, easy, to, fake, should, they, turn, out, to, be, lies, listeners, will, adapt, by, ignoring, them, in, favor, of, hard, to, fake, indices, or, cues, for, language, to, work, then, listeners, must, be, confident, that, those, with, whom, they, are, on, speaking, terms, are, generally, likely, to, be, honest, a, peculiar, feature, of, language, is, displaced, reference, which, means, reference, to, topics, outside, the, currently, perceptible, situation, this, property, prevents, utterances, from, being, corroborated, in, the, immediate, here, and, now, for, this, reason, language, presupposes, relatively, high, levels, of, mutual, trust, in, order, to, become, established, over, time, as, an, evolutionarily, stable, strategy, this, stability, is, born, of, a, longstanding, mutual, trust, and, is, what, grants, language, its, authority, a, theory, of, the, origins, of, language, must, therefore, explain, why, humans, could, begin, trusting, cheap, signals, in, ways, that, other, animals, apparently, cannot, see, signalling, theory, the, mother, tongues, hypothesis, was, proposed, in, 2004, as, a, possible, solution, to, this, problem, w, tecumseh, fitch, suggested, that, the, darwinian, principle, of, kin, selection, the, convergence, of, genetic, interests, between, relatives, might, be, part, of, the, answer, fitch, suggests, that, languages, were, originally, mother, tongues, if, language, evolved, initially, for, communication, between, mothers, and, their, own, biological, offspring, extending, later, to, include, adult, relatives, as, well, the, interests, of, speakers, and, listeners, would, have, tended, to, coincide, fitch, argues, that, shared, genetic, interests, would, have, led, to, sufficient, trust, and, cooperation, for, intrinsically, unreliable, signals, words, to, become, accepted, as, trustworthy, and, so, begin, evolving, for, the, first, time, critics, of, this, theory, point, out, that, kin, selection, is, not, unique, to, humans, so, even, if, one, accepts, fitch, s, initial, premises, the, extension, of, the, posited, mother, tongue, networks, from, close, relatives, to, more, distant, relatives, remains, unexplained, fitch, argues, however, that, the, extended, period, of, physical, immaturity, of, human, infants, and, the, postnatal, growth, of, the, human, brain, give, the, human, infant, relationship, a, different, and, more, extended, period, of, intergenerational, dependency, than, that, found, in, any, other, species, ib, ulb, k, invokes, another, standard, darwinian, principle, reciprocal, altruism, to, explain, the, unusually, high, levels, of, intentional, honesty, necessary, for, language, to, evolve, reciprocal, altruism, can, be, expressed, as, the, principle, that, if, you, scratch, my, back, i, ll, scratch, yours, in, linguistic, terms, it, would, mean, that, if, you, speak, truthfully, to, me, i, ll, speak, truthfully, to, you, ordinary, darwinian, reciprocal, altruism, ulb, k, points, out, is, a, relationship, established, between, frequently, interacting, individuals, for, language, to, prevail, across, an, entire, community, however, the, necessary, reciprocity, would, have, needed, to, be, enforced, universally, instead, of, being, left, to, individual, choice, ulb, k, concludes, that, for, language, to, evolve, society, as, a, whole, must, have, been, subject, to, moral, regulation, critics, point, out, that, this, theory, fails, to, explain, when, how, why, or, by, whom, obligatory, reciprocal, altruism, could, possibly, have, been, enforced, various, proposals, have, been, offered, to, remedy, this, defect, a, further, criticism, is, that, language, does, not, work, on, the, basis, of, reciprocal, altruism, anyway, humans, in, conversational, groups, do, not, withhold, information, to, all, except, listeners, likely, to, offer, valuable, information, in, return, on, the, contrary, they, seem, to, want, to, advertise, to, the, world, their, access, to, socially, relevant, information, broadcasting, that, information, without, expectation, of, reciprocity, to, anyone, who, will, listen, gossip, according, to, robin, dunbar, in, his, book, grooming, gossip, and, the, evolution, of, language, language, does, for, group, living, humans, what, manual, grooming, does, for, other, primates, it, allows, individuals, to, service, their, relationships, and, so, maintain, their, alliances, on, the, basis, of, the, principle, if, you, scratch, my, back, i, ll, scratch, yours, dunbar, argues, that, as, humans, began, living, in, increasingly, larger, social, groups, the, task, of, manually, grooming, all, one, s, friends, and, acquaintances, became, so, time, consuming, as, to, be, unaffordable, in, response, to, this, problem, humans, developed, a, cheap, and, ultra, efficient, form, of, grooming, vocal, grooming, to, keep, allies, happy, one, now, needs, only, to, groom, them, with, low, cost, vocal, sounds, servicing, multiple, allies, simultaneously, while, keeping, both, hands, free, for, other, tasks, vocal, grooming, then, evolved, gradually, into, vocal, language, initially, in, the, form, of, gossip, dunbar, s, hypothesis, seems, to, be, supported, by, adaptations, in, the, structure, of, language, to, the, function, of, narration, in, general, critics, of, this, theory, point, out, that, the, very, efficiency, of, vocal, grooming, the, fact, that, words, are, so, cheap, would, have, undermined, its, capacity, to, signal, commitment, of, the, kind, conveyed, by, time, consuming, and, costly, manual, grooming, a, further, criticism, is, that, the, theory, does, nothing, to, explain, the, crucial, transition, from, vocal, grooming, the, production, of, pleasing, but, meaningless, sounds, to, the, cognitive, complexities, of, syntactical, speech, the, ritual, speech, coevolution, theory, was, originally, proposed, by, social, anthropologist, roy, rappaport, before, being, elaborated, by, anthropologists, such, as, chris, knight, jerome, lewis, nick, enfield, camilla, power, and, ian, watts, cognitive, scientist, and, robotics, engineer, luc, steels, is, another, prominent, supporter, of, this, general, approach, as, is, biological, anthropologist, and, neuroscientist, terrence, deacon, a, more, recent, champion, of, the, approach, is, the, chomskyan, specialist, in, linguistic, syntax, cedric, boeckx, these, scholars, argue, that, there, can, be, no, such, thing, as, a, theory, of, the, origins, of, language, this, is, because, language, is, not, a, separate, adaptation, but, an, internal, aspect, of, something, much, wider, namely, the, entire, domain, known, to, anthropologists, as, human, symbolic, culture, attempts, to, explain, language, independently, of, this, wider, context, have, failed, say, these, scientists, because, they, are, addressing, a, problem, with, no, solution, language, would, not, work, outside, its, necessary, environment, of, confidence, building, social, mechanisms, and, institutions, for, example, it, would, not, work, for, a, nonhuman, ape, communicating, with, others, of, its, kind, in, the, wild, not, even, the, cleverest, nonhuman, ape, could, make, language, work, under, such, conditions, lie, and, alternative, inherent, in, language, pose, problems, to, any, society, whose, structure, is, founded, on, language, which, is, to, say, all, human, societies, i, have, therefore, argued, that, if, there, are, to, be, words, at, all, it, is, necessary, to, establish, the, word, and, that, the, word, is, established, by, the, invariance, of, liturgy, advocates, of, this, school, of, thought, point, out, that, words, are, cheap, should, an, especially, clever, nonhuman, ape, or, even, a, group, of, articulate, nonhuman, apes, try, to, use, words, in, the, wild, they, would, carry, no, conviction, the, primate, vocalizations, that, do, carry, conviction, those, they, actually, use, are, unlike, words, in, that, they, are, emotionally, expressive, intrinsically, meaningful, and, reliable, because, they, are, relatively, costly, and, hard, to, fake, oral, and, gestural, languages, consist, of, pattern, making, whose, cost, is, essentially, zero, as, pure, social, conventions, signals, of, this, kind, cannot, evolve, in, a, darwinian, social, world, they, are, a, theoretical, impossibility, being, intrinsically, unreliable, language, works, only, if, one, can, build, up, a, reputation, for, trustworthiness, within, a, certain, kind, of, society, namely, one, where, symbolic, cultural, facts, sometimes, called, institutional, facts, can, be, established, and, maintained, through, collective, social, endorsement, in, any, hunter, gatherer, society, the, basic, mechanism, for, establishing, trust, in, symbolic, cultural, facts, is, collective, ritual, therefore, the, task, facing, researchers, into, the, origins, of, language, is, more, multidisciplinary, than, is, usually, supposed, it, involves, addressing, the, evolutionary, emergence, of, human, ritual, kinship, religion, and, symbolic, culture, taken, as, a, whole, with, language, an, important, but, subsidiary, component, an, authoritative, current, proponent, of, the, ritual, speech, co, evolution, approach, is, cedric, boeckx, a, specialist, in, syntax, known, for, his, work, in, explicating, chomsky, s, minimalist, program, in, a, 2023, article, boeckx, endorses, the, rappaport, searle, knight, way, of, capturing, the, special, nature, of, human, words, words, are, symbols, this, means, that, from, a, standpoint, in, darwinian, signal, evolution, theory, they, are, patently, false, signals, words, are, facts, but, facts, whose, existence, depends, entirely, on, subjective, belief, in, philosophical, terms, they, are, institutional, facts, fictions, that, are, granted, factual, status, within, human, social, institutions, from, this, standpoint, according, to, boeckx, linguistic, utterances, are, symbolic, to, the, extent, that, they, are, patent, falsehoods, serving, as, guides, to, communicative, intentions, they, are, communicatively, useful, untruths, as, it, were, the, reason, why, words, can, survive, among, humans, despite, being, false, is, largely, down, to, a, matter, of, trust, the, corresponding, origins, theory, is, that, language, can, only, have, begun, to, evolve, from, the, moment, humans, started, reciprocally, faking, in, communicatively, helpful, ways, i, e, when, they, became, capable, of, upholding, the, levels, of, trust, necessary, for, linguistic, communication, to, work, the, point, here, is, that, an, ape, or, other, nonhuman, must, always, carry, at, least, some, of, the, burden, of, generating, the, trust, necessary, for, communication, to, work, that, is, in, order, to, be, taken, seriously, each, signal, it, emits, must, be, a, patently, reliable, one, trusted, because, it, is, rooted, in, some, way, in, the, real, world, but, now, imagine, what, might, happen, under, social, conditions, where, trust, could, be, taken, for, granted, the, signaller, could, stop, worrying, about, reliability, and, concentrate, instead, on, perceptual, discriminability, carried, to, its, conclusion, this, should, permit, digital, signaling, the, cheapest, and, most, efficient, kind, of, communication, from, this, philosophical, standpoint, animal, communication, cannot, be, digital, because, it, does, not, have, the, luxury, of, being, patently, false, costly, signals, of, any, kind, can, only, be, evaluated, on, an, analog, scale, put, differently, truly, symbolic, digital, signals, become, socially, acceptable, only, under, highly, unusual, conditions, such, as, those, internal, to, a, ritually, bonded, community, whose, members, are, not, tempted, to, lie, critics, of, the, speech, ritual, co, evolution, idea, theory, include, noam, chomsky, who, terms, it, the, non, existence, hypothesis, a, denial, of, the, very, existence, of, language, as, an, object, of, study, for, natural, science, chomsky, s, own, theory, is, that, language, emerged, in, an, instant, and, in, perfect, form, prompting, his, critics, in, turn, to, retort, that, only, something, that, does, not, exist, a, theoretical, construct, or, convenient, scientific, fiction, could, possibly, emerge, in, such, a, miraculous, way, the, controversy, remains, unresolved, acheulean, tool, use, began, during, the, lower, paleolithic, approximately, 1, 75, million, years, ago, studies, focusing, on, the, lateralization, of, acheulean, tool, production, and, language, production, have, noted, similar, areas, of, blood, flow, when, engaging, in, these, activities, separately, this, theory, suggests, that, the, brain, functions, needed, for, the, production, of, tools, across, generations, is, consistent, with, the, brain, systems, required, for, producing, language, researchers, used, functional, transcranial, doppler, ultrasonography, ftdc, and, had, participants, perform, activities, related, to, the, creation, of, tools, using, the, same, methods, during, the, lower, paleolithic, as, well, as, a, task, designed, specifically, for, word, generation, the, purpose, of, this, test, was, to, focus, on, the, planning, aspect, of, acheulean, tool, making, and, cued, word, generation, in, language, an, example, of, cued, word, generation, would, be, trying, to, list, all, words, beginning, with, a, given, letter, theories, of, language, developing, alongside, tool, use, has, been, theorized, by, multiple, individuals, however, until, recently, there, has, been, little, empirical, data, to, support, these, hypotheses, focusing, on, the, results, of, the, study, performed, by, uomini, et, al, evidence, for, the, usage, of, the, same, brain, areas, has, been, found, when, looking, at, cued, word, generation, and, achuelean, tool, use, the, relationship, between, tool, use, and, language, production, is, found, in, working, and, planning, memory, respectively, and, was, found, to, be, similar, across, a, variety, of, participants, furthering, evidence, that, these, areas, of, the, brain, are, shared, this, evidence, lends, credibility, to, the, theory, that, language, developed, alongside, tool, use, in, the, lower, paleolithic, the, humanistic, tradition, considers, language, as, a, human, invention, renaissance, philosopher, antoine, arnauld, gave, a, detailed, description, of, his, idea, of, the, origin, of, language, in, port, royal, grammar, according, to, arnauld, people, are, social, and, rational, by, nature, and, this, urged, them, to, create, language, as, a, means, to, communicate, their, ideas, to, others, language, construction, would, have, occurred, through, a, slow, and, gradual, process, in, later, theory, especially, in, functional, linguistics, the, primacy, of, communication, is, emphasised, over, psychological, needs, the, exact, way, language, evolved, is, however, not, considered, as, vital, to, the, study, of, languages, structural, linguist, ferdinand, de, saussure, abandoned, evolutionary, linguistics, after, having, come, to, the, firm, conclusion, that, it, would, not, be, able, to, provide, any, further, revolutionary, insight, after, the, completion, of, the, major, works, in, historical, linguistics, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, saussure, was, particularly, sceptical, of, the, attempts, of, august, schleicher, and, other, darwinian, linguists, to, access, prehistorical, languages, through, series, of, reconstructions, of, proto, languages, saussure, s, solution, to, the, problem, of, language, evolution, involves, dividing, theoretical, linguistics, in, two, evolutionary, and, historical, linguistics, are, renamed, as, diachronic, linguistics, it, is, the, study, of, language, change, but, it, has, only, limited, explanatory, power, due, to, the, inadequacy, of, all, of, the, reliable, research, material, that, could, ever, be, made, available, synchronic, linguistics, in, contrast, aims, to, widen, scientists, understanding, of, language, through, a, study, of, a, given, contemporary, or, historical, language, stage, as, a, system, in, its, own, right, although, saussure, put, much, focus, on, diachronic, linguistics, later, structuralists, who, equated, structuralism, with, the, synchronic, analysis, were, sometimes, criticised, of, ahistoricism, according, to, structural, anthropologist, claude, l, vi, strauss, language, and, meaning, in, opposition, to, knowledge, which, develops, slowly, and, progressively, must, have, appeared, in, an, instant, structuralism, as, first, introduced, to, sociology, by, mile, durkheim, is, nonetheless, a, type, of, humanistic, evolutionary, theory, which, explains, diversification, as, necessitated, by, growing, complexity, there, was, a, shift, of, focus, to, functional, explanation, after, saussure, s, death, functional, structuralists, including, the, prague, circle, linguists, and, andr, martinet, explained, the, growth, and, maintenance, of, structures, as, being, necessitated, by, their, functions, for, example, novel, technologies, make, it, necessary, for, people, to, invent, new, words, but, these, may, lose, their, function, and, be, forgotten, as, the, technologies, are, eventually, replaced, by, more, modern, ones, according, to, noam, chomsky, s, single, mutation, theory, the, emergence, of, language, resembled, the, formation, of, a, crystal, with, digital, infinity, as, the, seed, crystal, in, a, super, saturated, primate, brain, on, the, verge, of, blossoming, into, the, human, mind, by, physical, law, once, evolution, added, a, single, small, but, crucial, keystone, thus, in, this, theory, language, appeared, rather, suddenly, within, the, history, of, human, evolution, chomsky, writing, with, computational, linguist, and, computer, scientist, robert, c, berwick, suggests, that, this, scenario, is, completely, compatible, with, modern, biology, they, note, that, none, of, the, recent, accounts, of, human, language, evolution, seem, to, have, completely, grasped, the, shift, from, conventional, darwinism, to, its, fully, stochastic, modern, version, specifically, that, there, are, stochastic, effects, not, only, due, to, sampling, like, directionless, drift, but, also, due, to, directed, stochastic, variation, in, fitness, migration, and, heritability, indeed, all, the, forces, that, affect, individual, or, gene, frequencies, all, this, can, affect, evolutionary, outcomes, outcomes, that, as, far, as, we, can, make, out, are, not, brought, out, in, recent, books, on, the, evolution, of, language, yet, would, arise, immediately, in, the, case, of, any, new, genetic, or, individual, innovation, precisely, the, kind, of, scenario, likely, to, be, in, play, when, talking, about, language, s, emergence, citing, evolutionary, geneticist, svante, p, bo, they, concur, that, a, substantial, difference, must, have, occurred, to, differentiate, homo, sapiens, from, neanderthals, to, prompt, the, relentless, spread, of, our, species, who, had, never, crossed, open, water, up, and, out, of, africa, and, then, on, across, the, entire, planet, in, just, a, few, tens, of, thousands, of, years, what, we, do, not, see, is, any, kind, of, gradualism, in, new, tool, technologies, or, innovations, like, fire, shelters, or, figurative, art, berwick, and, chomsky, therefore, suggest, language, emerged, approximately, between, 200, 000, years, ago, and, 60, 000, years, ago, between, the, appearance, of, the, first, anatomically, modern, humans, in, southern, africa, and, the, last, exodus, from, africa, respectively, that, leaves, us, with, about, 130, 000, years, or, approximately, 5, 000, 6, 000, generations, of, time, for, evolutionary, change, this, is, not, overnight, in, one, generation, as, some, have, incorrectly, inferred, but, neither, is, it, on, the, scale, of, geological, eons, it, s, time, enough, within, the, ballpark, for, what, nilsson, and, pelger, 1994, estimated, as, the, time, required, for, the, full, evolution, of, a, vertebrate, eye, from, a, single, cell, even, without, the, invocation, of, any, evo, devo, effects, the, single, mutation, theory, of, language, evolution, has, been, directly, questioned, on, different, grounds, a, formal, analysis, of, the, probability, of, such, a, mutation, taking, place, and, going, to, fixation, in, the, species, has, concluded, that, such, a, scenario, is, unlikely, with, multiple, mutations, with, more, moderate, fitness, effects, being, more, probable, another, criticism, has, questioned, the, logic, of, the, argument, for, single, mutation, and, puts, forward, that, from, the, formal, simplicity, of, merge, the, capacity, berwick, and, chomsky, deem, the, core, property, of, human, language, that, emerged, suddenly, one, cannot, derive, the, number, of, evolutionary, steps, that, led, to, it, the, romulus, and, remus, hypothesis, proposed, by, neuroscientist, andrey, vyshedskiy, seeks, to, address, the, question, as, to, why, the, modern, speech, apparatus, originated, over, 500, 000, years, before, the, earliest, signs, of, modern, human, imagination, this, hypothesis, proposes, that, there, were, two, phases, that, led, to, modern, recursive, language, the, phenomenon, of, recursion, occurs, across, multiple, linguistic, domains, arguably, most, prominently, in, syntax, and, morphology, thus, by, nesting, a, structure, such, as, a, sentence, or, a, word, within, themselves, it, enables, the, generation, of, potentially, countably, infinite, new, variations, of, that, structure, for, example, the, base, sentence, can, be, nested, in, irrealis, clauses, to, produce, and, so, forth, the, first, phase, includes, the, slow, development, of, non, recursive, language, with, a, large, vocabulary, along, with, the, modern, speech, apparatus, which, includes, changes, to, the, hyoid, bone, increased, voluntary, control, of, the, muscles, of, the, diaphragm, the, evolution, of, the, foxp2, gene, as, well, as, other, changes, by, 600, 000, years, ago, then, the, second, phase, was, a, rapid, chomskian, single, step, consisting, of, three, distinct, events, that, happened, in, quick, succession, around, 70, 000, years, ago, and, allowed, the, shift, from, non, recursive, to, recursive, language, in, early, hominins, it, is, not, enough, for, children, to, have, a, modern, prefrontal, cortex, pfc, to, allow, the, development, of, pfs, the, children, must, also, be, mentally, stimulated, and, have, recursive, elements, already, in, their, language, to, acquire, pfs, since, their, parents, would, not, have, invented, these, elements, yet, the, children, would, have, had, to, do, it, themselves, which, is, a, common, occurrence, among, young, children, that, live, together, in, a, process, called, cryptophasia, this, means, that, delayed, pfc, development, would, have, allowed, more, time, to, acquire, pfs, and, develop, recursive, elements, delayed, pfc, development, also, comes, with, negative, consequences, such, as, a, longer, period, of, reliance, on, one, s, parents, to, survive, and, lower, survival, rates, for, modern, language, to, have, occurred, pfc, delay, had, to, have, an, immense, survival, benefit, in, later, life, such, as, pfs, ability, this, suggests, that, the, mutation, that, caused, pfc, delay, and, the, development, of, recursive, language, and, pfs, occurred, simultaneously, which, lines, up, with, evidence, of, a, genetic, bottleneck, around, 70, 000, years, ago, this, could, have, been, the, result, of, a, few, individuals, who, developed, pfs, and, recursive, language, which, gave, them, significant, competitive, advantage, over, all, other, humans, at, the, time, the, gestural, theory, states, that, human, language, developed, from, gestures, that, were, used, for, simple, communication, two, types, of, evidence, support, this, theory, research, has, found, strong, support, for, the, idea, that, verbal, language, and, sign, language, depend, on, similar, neural, structures, patients, who, used, sign, language, and, who, suffered, from, a, left, hemisphere, lesion, showed, the, same, disorders, with, their, sign, language, as, vocal, patients, did, with, their, oral, language, other, researchers, found, that, the, same, left, hemisphere, brain, regions, were, active, during, sign, language, as, during, the, use, of, vocal, or, written, language, primate, gesture, is, at, least, partially, genetic, different, nonhuman, apes, will, perform, gestures, characteristic, of, their, species, even, if, they, have, never, seen, another, ape, perform, that, gesture, for, example, gorillas, beat, their, breasts, this, shows, that, gestures, are, an, intrinsic, and, important, part, of, primate, communication, which, supports, the, idea, that, language, evolved, from, gesture, further, evidence, suggests, that, gesture, and, language, are, linked, in, humans, manually, gesturing, has, an, effect, on, concurrent, vocalizations, thus, creating, certain, natural, vocal, associations, of, manual, efforts, chimpanzees, move, their, mouths, when, performing, fine, motor, tasks, these, mechanisms, may, have, played, an, evolutionary, role, in, enabling, the, development, of, intentional, vocal, communication, as, a, supplement, to, gestural, communication, voice, modulation, could, have, been, prompted, by, preexisting, manual, actions, from, infancy, gestures, both, supplement, and, predict, speech, this, addresses, the, idea, that, gestures, quickly, change, in, humans, from, a, sole, means, of, communication, from, a, very, young, age, to, a, supplemental, and, predictive, behavior, that, is, used, despite, the, ability, to, communicate, verbally, this, too, serves, as, a, parallel, to, the, idea, that, gestures, developed, first, and, language, subsequently, built, upon, it, two, possible, scenarios, have, been, proposed, for, the, development, of, language, one, of, which, supports, the, gestural, theory, the, first, perspective, that, language, evolved, from, the, calls, of, human, ancestors, seems, logical, because, both, humans, and, animals, make, sounds, or, cries, one, evolutionary, reason, to, refute, this, is, that, anatomically, the, centre, that, controls, calls, in, monkeys, and, other, animals, is, located, in, a, completely, different, part, of, the, brain, than, in, humans, in, monkeys, this, centre, is, located, in, the, depths, of, the, brain, related, to, emotions, in, the, human, system, it, is, located, in, an, area, unrelated, to, emotion, humans, can, communicate, simply, to, communicate, without, emotions, so, anatomically, this, scenario, does, not, work, this, suggests, that, language, was, derived, from, gesture, humans, communicated, by, gesture, first, and, sound, was, attached, later, the, important, question, for, gestural, theories, is, why, there, was, a, shift, to, vocalization, various, explanations, have, been, proposed, a, comparable, hypothesis, states, that, in, articulate, language, gesture, and, vocalisation, are, intrinsically, linked, as, language, evolved, from, equally, intrinsically, linked, dance, and, song, humans, still, use, manual, and, facial, gestures, when, they, speak, especially, when, people, meet, who, have, no, language, in, common, there, are, also, a, great, number, of, sign, languages, still, in, existence, commonly, associated, with, deaf, communities, these, sign, languages, are, equal, in, complexity, sophistication, and, expressive, power, to, any, oral, language, the, cognitive, functions, are, similar, and, the, parts, of, the, brain, used, are, similar, the, main, difference, is, that, the, phonemes, are, produced, on, the, outside, of, the, body, articulated, with, hands, body, and, facial, expression, rather, than, inside, the, body, articulated, with, tongue, teeth, lips, and, breathing, compare, the, motor, theory, of, speech, perception, critics, of, gestural, theory, note, that, it, is, difficult, to, name, serious, reasons, why, the, initial, pitch, based, vocal, communication, which, is, present, in, primates, would, be, abandoned, in, favor, of, the, much, less, effective, non, vocal, gestural, communication, however, michael, corballis, has, pointed, out, that, it, is, supposed, that, primate, vocal, communication, such, as, alarm, calls, cannot, be, controlled, consciously, unlike, hand, movement, and, thus, it, is, not, credible, as, precursor, to, human, language, primate, vocalization, is, rather, homologous, to, and, continued, in, involuntary, reflexes, connected, with, basic, human, emotions, such, as, screams, or, laughter, the, fact, that, these, can, be, faked, does, not, disprove, the, fact, that, genuine, involuntary, responses, to, fear, or, surprise, exist, also, gesture, is, not, generally, less, effective, and, depending, on, the, situation, can, even, be, advantageous, for, example, in, a, loud, environment, or, where, it, is, important, to, be, silent, such, as, on, a, hunt, other, challenges, to, the, gesture, first, theory, have, been, presented, by, researchers, in, psycholinguistics, including, david, mcneill, proponents, of, the, motor, theory, of, language, evolution, have, primarily, focused, on, the, visual, domain, and, communication, through, observation, of, movements, the, tool, use, sound, hypothesis, suggests, that, the, production, and, perception, of, sound, also, contributed, substantially, particularly, incidental, sound, of, locomotion, isol, and, tool, use, sound, tus, human, bipedalism, resulted, in, rhythmic, and, more, predictable, isol, that, may, have, stimulated, the, evolution, of, musical, abilities, auditory, working, memory, and, abilities, to, produce, complex, vocalizations, and, to, mimic, natural, sounds, since, the, human, brain, proficiently, extracts, information, about, objects, and, events, from, the, sounds, they, produce, tus, and, mimicry, of, tus, might, have, achieved, an, iconic, function, the, prevalence, of, sound, symbolism, in, many, extant, languages, supports, this, idea, self, produced, tus, activates, multimodal, brain, processing, motor, neurons, hearing, proprioception, touch, vision, and, tus, stimulates, primate, audiovisual, mirror, neurons, which, is, likely, to, stimulate, the, development, of, association, chains, tool, use, and, auditory, gestures, involve, motor, processing, of, the, forelimbs, which, is, associated, with, the, evolution, of, vertebrate, vocal, communication, the, production, perception, and, mimicry, of, tus, may, have, resulted, in, a, limited, number, of, vocalizations, or, protowords, that, were, associated, with, tool, use, a, new, way, to, communicate, about, tools, especially, when, out, of, sight, would, have, had, selective, advantage, a, gradual, change, in, acoustic, properties, meaning, or, both, could, have, resulted, in, arbitrariness, and, an, expanded, repertoire, of, words, humans, have, been, increasingly, exposed, to, tus, over, millions, of, years, coinciding, with, the, period, during, which, spoken, language, evolved, in, humans, functional, mri, studies, have, reported, finding, areas, homologous, to, the, monkey, mirror, neuron, system, in, the, inferior, frontal, cortex, close, to, broca, s, area, one, of, the, language, regions, of, the, brain, this, has, led, to, suggestions, that, human, language, evolved, from, a, gesture, performance, understanding, system, implemented, in, mirror, neurons, mirror, neurons, have, been, said, to, have, the, potential, to, provide, a, mechanism, for, action, understanding, imitation, learning, and, the, simulation, of, other, people, s, behavior, this, hypothesis, is, supported, by, some, cytoarchitectonic, homologies, between, monkey, premotor, area, f5, and, human, broca, s, area, rates, of, vocabulary, expansion, link, to, the, ability, of, children, to, vocally, mirror, non, words, and, so, to, acquire, the, new, word, pronunciations, such, speech, repetition, occurs, automatically, quickly, and, separately, in, the, brain, to, speech, perception, moreover, such, vocal, imitation, can, occur, without, comprehension, such, as, in, speech, shadowing, and, echolalia, further, evidence, for, this, link, comes, from, a, recent, study, in, which, the, brain, activity, of, two, participants, was, measured, using, fmri, while, they, were, gesturing, words, to, each, other, using, hand, gestures, with, a, game, of, charades, a, modality, that, some, have, suggested, might, represent, the, evolutionary, precursor, of, human, language, analysis, of, the, data, using, granger, causality, revealed, that, the, mirror, neuron, system, of, the, observer, indeed, reflects, the, pattern, of, activity, of, in, the, motor, system, of, the, sender, supporting, the, idea, that, the, motor, concept, associated, with, the, words, is, indeed, transmitted, from, one, brain, to, another, using, the, mirror, system, not, all, linguists, agree, with, the, above, arguments, however, in, particular, supporters, of, noam, chomsky, argue, against, the, possibility, that, the, mirror, neuron, system, can, play, any, role, in, the, hierarchical, recursive, structures, essential, to, syntax, according, to, dean, falk, s, putting, down, the, baby, theory, vocal, interactions, between, early, hominid, mothers, and, infants, began, a, sequence, of, events, that, led, eventually, to, human, ancestors, earliest, words, the, basic, idea, is, that, evolving, human, mothers, unlike, their, counterparts, in, other, primates, could, not, move, around, and, forage, with, their, infants, clinging, onto, their, backs, loss, of, fur, in, the, human, case, left, infants, with, no, means, of, clinging, on, frequently, therefore, mothers, had, to, put, their, babies, down, as, a, result, these, babies, needed, to, be, reassured, that, they, were, not, being, abandoned, mothers, responded, by, developing, motherese, an, infant, directed, communicative, system, embracing, facial, expressions, body, language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling, and, emotionally, expressive, contact, calls, the, argument, is, that, language, developed, out, of, this, interaction, in, the, mental, and, social, life, of, babies, psychologist, kenneth, kaye, noted, that, no, usable, adult, language, could, have, evolved, without, interactive, communication, between, very, young, children, and, adults, no, symbolic, system, could, have, survived, from, one, generation, to, the, next, if, it, could, not, have, been, easily, acquired, by, young, children, under, their, normal, conditions, of, social, life, the, from, where, to, what, model, is, a, language, evolution, model, that, is, derived, primarily, from, the, organization, of, language, processing, in, the, brain, into, two, structures, the, auditory, dorsal, stream, and, the, auditory, ventral, stream, it, hypothesizes, seven, stages, of, language, evolution, see, illustration, speech, originated, for, the, purpose, of, exchanging, contact, calls, between, mothers, and, their, offspring, to, find, one, another, in, the, event, they, became, separated, illustration, part, 1, the, contact, calls, could, be, modified, with, intonations, in, order, to, express, either, a, higher, or, lower, level, of, distress, illustration, part, 2, the, use, of, two, types, of, contact, calls, enabled, the, first, question, answer, conversation, in, this, scenario, the, child, would, emit, a, low, level, distress, call, to, express, a, desire, to, interact, with, an, object, and, the, mother, would, respond, with, either, another, low, level, distress, call, to, express, approval, of, the, interaction, or, a, high, level, distress, call, to, express, disapproval, illustration, part, 3, over, time, the, improved, use, of, intonations, and, vocal, control, led, to, the, invention, of, unique, calls, phonemes, associated, with, distinct, objects, illustration, part, 4, at, first, children, learned, the, calls, phonemes, from, their, parents, by, imitating, their, lip, movements, illustration, part, 5, eventually, infants, were, able, to, encode, into, long, term, memory, all, the, calls, phonemes, consequentially, mimicry, via, lip, reading, was, limited, to, infancy, and, older, children, learned, new, calls, through, mimicry, without, lip, reading, illustration, part, 6, once, individuals, became, capable, of, producing, a, sequence, of, calls, this, allowed, multi, syllabic, words, which, increased, the, size, of, their, vocabulary, illustration, part, 7, the, use, of, words, composed, of, sequences, of, syllables, provided, the, infra, structure, for, communicating, with, sequences, of, words, i, e, sentences, the, theory, s, name, is, derived, from, the, two, auditory, streams, which, are, both, found, in, the, brains, of, humans, and, other, primates, the, auditory, ventral, stream, is, responsible, for, sound, recognition, and, so, it, is, referred, to, as, the, auditory, what, stream, in, primates, the, auditory, dorsal, stream, is, responsible, for, sound, localization, and, thus, it, is, called, the, auditory, where, stream, only, in, humans, in, the, left, hemisphere, is, it, also, responsible, for, other, processes, associated, with, language, use, and, acquisition, such, as, speech, repetition, and, production, integration, of, phonemes, with, their, lip, movements, perception, and, production, of, intonations, phonological, long, term, memory, long, term, memory, storage, of, the, sounds, of, words, and, phonological, working, memory, the, temporary, storage, of, the, sounds, of, words, some, evidence, also, indicates, a, role, in, recognising, others, by, their, voices, the, emergence, of, each, of, these, functions, in, the, auditory, dorsal, stream, represents, an, intermediate, stage, in, the, evolution, of, language, a, contact, call, origin, for, human, language, is, consistent, with, animal, studies, as, like, human, language, contact, call, discrimination, in, monkeys, is, lateralised, to, the, left, hemisphere, mice, with, knock, out, to, language, related, genes, such, as, foxp2, and, srpx2, also, resulted, in, the, pups, no, longer, emitting, contact, calls, when, separated, from, their, mothers, supporting, this, model, is, also, its, ability, to, explain, unique, human, phenomena, such, as, the, use, of, intonations, when, converting, words, into, commands, and, questions, the, tendency, of, infants, to, mimic, vocalisations, during, the, first, year, of, life, and, its, disappearance, later, on, and, the, protruding, and, visible, human, lips, which, are, not, found, in, other, apes, this, theory, could, be, considered, an, elaboration, of, the, putting, down, the, baby, theory, of, language, evolution, grammaticalisation, is, a, continuous, historical, process, in, which, free, standing, words, develop, into, grammatical, appendages, while, these, in, turn, become, ever, more, specialised, and, grammatical, an, initially, incorrect, usage, in, becoming, accepted, leads, to, unforeseen, consequences, triggering, knock, on, effects, and, extended, sequences, of, change, paradoxically, grammar, evolves, because, in, the, final, analysis, humans, care, less, about, grammatical, niceties, than, about, making, themselves, understood, if, this, is, how, grammar, evolves, today, according, to, this, school, of, thought, similar, principles, at, work, can, be, legitimately, inferred, among, distant, human, ancestors, when, grammar, itself, was, first, being, established, in, order, to, reconstruct, the, evolutionary, transition, from, early, language, to, languages, with, complex, grammars, it, is, necessary, to, know, which, hypothetical, sequences, are, plausible, and, which, are, not, in, order, to, convey, abstract, ideas, the, first, recourse, of, speakers, is, to, fall, back, on, immediately, recognizable, concrete, imagery, very, often, deploying, metaphors, rooted, in, shared, bodily, experience, a, familiar, example, is, the, use, of, concrete, terms, such, as, belly, or, back, to, convey, abstract, meanings, such, as, inside, or, behind, equally, metaphorical, is, the, strategy, of, representing, temporal, patterns, on, the, model, of, spatial, ones, for, example, english, speakers, might, say, it, is, going, to, rain, modelled, on, i, am, going, to, london, this, can, be, abbreviated, colloquially, to, it, s, gonna, rain, even, when, in, a, hurry, english, speakers, do, not, say, i, m, gonna, london, the, contraction, is, restricted, to, the, job, of, specifying, tense, from, such, examples, it, can, be, seen, why, grammaticalisation, is, consistently, unidirectional, from, concrete, to, abstract, meaning, not, the, other, way, around, grammaticalisation, theorists, picture, early, language, as, simple, perhaps, consisting, only, of, nouns, p, 111, even, under, that, extreme, theoretical, assumption, however, it, is, difficult, to, imagine, what, would, realistically, have, prevented, people, from, using, say, spear, as, if, it, were, a, verb, spear, that, pig, people, might, have, used, their, nouns, as, verbs, or, their, verbs, as, nouns, as, occasion, demanded, in, short, while, a, noun, only, language, might, seem, theoretically, possible, grammaticalisation, theory, indicates, that, it, cannot, have, remained, fixed, in, that, state, for, any, length, of, time, creativity, drives, grammatical, change, this, presupposes, a, certain, attitude, on, the, part, of, listeners, instead, of, punishing, deviations, from, accepted, usage, listeners, must, prioritise, imaginative, mind, reading, imaginative, creativity, emitting, a, leopard, alarm, when, no, leopard, was, present, for, example, is, not, the, kind, of, behaviour, which, say, vervet, monkeys, would, appreciate, or, reward, creativity, and, reliability, are, incompatible, demands, for, machiavellian, primates, as, for, animals, generally, the, overriding, pressure, is, to, demonstrate, reliability, if, humans, escape, these, constraints, it, is, because, in, their, case, listeners, are, primarily, interested, in, mental, states, to, focus, on, mental, states, is, to, accept, fictions, inhabitants, of, the, imagination, as, potentially, informative, and, interesting, an, example, is, metaphor, a, metaphor, is, literally, a, false, statement, in, romeo, and, juliet, romeo, declares, juliet, is, the, sun, juliet, is, a, woman, not, a, ball, of, plasma, in, the, sky, but, human, listeners, are, not, or, not, usually, pedants, insistent, on, point, by, point, factual, accuracy, they, want, to, know, what, the, speaker, has, in, mind, grammaticalisation, is, essentially, based, on, metaphor, to, outlaw, its, use, would, be, to, stop, grammar, from, evolving, and, by, the, same, token, to, exclude, all, possibility, of, expressing, abstract, thought, a, criticism, of, all, this, is, that, while, grammaticalisation, theory, might, explain, language, change, today, it, does, not, satisfactorily, address, the, really, difficult, challenge, explaining, the, initial, transition, from, primate, style, communication, to, language, as, it, is, known, today, rather, the, theory, assumes, that, language, already, exists, as, bernd, heine, and, tania, kuteva, acknowledge, grammaticalisation, requires, a, linguistic, system, that, is, used, regularly, and, frequently, within, a, community, of, speakers, and, is, passed, on, from, one, group, of, speakers, to, another, outside, modern, humans, such, conditions, do, not, prevail, human, language, is, used, for, self, expression, however, expression, displays, different, stages, the, consciousness, of, self, and, feelings, represents, the, stage, immediately, prior, to, the, external, phonetic, expression, of, feelings, in, the, form, of, sound, i, e, language, intelligent, animals, such, as, dolphins, eurasian, magpies, and, chimpanzees, live, in, communities, wherein, they, assign, themselves, roles, for, group, survival, and, show, emotions, such, as, sympathy, when, such, animals, view, their, reflection, mirror, test, they, recognise, themselves, and, exhibit, self, consciousness, notably, humans, evolved, in, a, quite, different, environment, than, that, of, these, animals, human, survival, became, easier, with, the, development, of, tools, shelter, and, fire, thus, facilitating, further, advancement, of, social, interaction, self, expression, and, tool, making, as, for, hunting, and, gathering, the, increasing, brain, size, allowed, advanced, provisioning, and, tools, and, the, technological, advances, during, the, palaeolithic, era, that, built, upon, the, previous, evolutionary, innovations, of, bipedalism, and, hand, versatility, allowed, the, development, of, human, language, according, to, a, study, investigating, the, song, differences, between, white, rumped, munias, and, its, domesticated, counterpart, bengalese, finch, the, wild, munias, use, a, highly, stereotyped, song, sequence, whereas, the, domesticated, ones, sing, a, highly, unconstrained, song, in, wild, finches, song, syntax, is, subject, to, female, preference, sexual, selection, and, remains, relatively, fixed, however, in, the, bengalese, finch, natural, selection, is, replaced, by, breeding, in, this, case, for, colourful, plumage, and, thus, decoupled, from, selective, pressures, stereotyped, song, syntax, is, allowed, to, drift, it, is, replaced, supposedly, within, 1000, generations, by, a, variable, and, learned, sequence, wild, finches, moreover, are, thought, incapable, of, learning, song, sequences, from, other, finches, in, the, field, of, bird, vocalisation, brains, capable, of, producing, only, an, innate, song, have, very, simple, neural, pathways, the, primary, forebrain, motor, centre, called, the, robust, nucleus, of, arcopallium, connects, to, midbrain, vocal, outputs, which, in, turn, project, to, brainstem, motor, nuclei, by, contrast, in, brains, capable, of, learning, songs, the, arcopallium, receives, input, from, numerous, additional, forebrain, regions, including, those, involved, in, learning, and, social, experience, control, over, song, generation, has, become, less, constrained, more, distributed, and, more, flexible, one, way, to, think, about, human, evolution, is, that, humans, are, self, domesticated, apes, just, as, domestication, relaxed, selection, for, stereotypic, songs, in, the, finches, mate, choice, was, supplanted, by, choices, made, by, the, aesthetic, sensibilities, of, bird, breeders, and, their, customers, so, might, human, cultural, domestication, have, relaxed, selection, on, many, of, their, primate, behavioural, traits, allowing, old, pathways, to, degenerate, and, reconfigure, given, the, highly, indeterminate, way, that, mammalian, brains, develop, they, basically, construct, themselves, bottom, up, with, one, set, of, neuronal, interactions, preparing, for, the, next, round, of, interactions, degraded, pathways, would, tend, to, seek, out, and, find, new, opportunities, for, synaptic, hookups, such, inherited, de, differentiations, of, brain, pathways, might, have, contributed, to, the, functional, complexity, that, characterises, human, language, and, as, exemplified, by, the, finches, such, de, differentiations, can, occur, in, very, rapid, time, frames, a, distinction, can, be, drawn, between, speech, and, language, language, is, not, necessarily, spoken, it, might, alternatively, be, written, or, signed, speech, is, among, a, number, of, different, methods, of, encoding, and, transmitting, linguistic, information, albeit, arguably, the, most, natural, one, some, scholars, such, as, noam, chomsky, view, language, as, an, initially, cognitive, development, its, externalisation, to, serve, communicative, purposes, occurring, later, in, human, evolution, according, to, one, such, school, of, thought, the, key, feature, distinguishing, human, language, is, recursion, in, this, context, the, iterative, embedding, of, phrases, within, phrases, other, scholars, notably, daniel, everett, deny, that, recursion, is, universal, citing, certain, languages, e, g, pirah, which, allegedly, lack, this, feature, the, ability, to, ask, questions, is, considered, by, some, to, distinguish, language, from, non, human, systems, of, communication, some, captive, primates, notably, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, having, learned, to, use, rudimentary, signing, to, communicate, with, their, human, trainers, proved, able, to, respond, correctly, to, complex, questions, and, requests, yet, they, failed, to, ask, even, the, simplest, questions, themselves, conversely, human, children, are, able, to, ask, their, first, questions, using, only, question, intonation, at, the, babbling, period, of, their, development, long, before, they, start, using, syntactic, structures, although, babies, from, different, cultures, acquire, native, languages, from, their, social, environment, all, languages, of, the, world, without, exception, tonal, non, tonal, intonational, and, accented, use, similar, rising, question, intonation, for, yes, no, questions, except, of, course, the, ones, that, don, t, this, fact, is, a, strong, evidence, of, the, universality, of, question, intonation, in, general, according, to, some, authors, sentence, intonation, pitch, is, pivotal, in, spoken, grammar, and, is, the, basic, information, used, by, children, to, learn, the, grammar, of, whatever, language, language, users, have, high, level, reference, or, deixis, the, ability, to, refer, to, things, or, states, of, being, that, are, not, in, the, immediate, realm, of, the, speaker, this, ability, is, often, related, to, theory, of, mind, or, an, awareness, of, the, other, as, a, being, like, the, self, with, individual, wants, and, intentions, according, to, chomsky, hauser, and, fitch, 2002, there, are, six, main, aspects, of, this, high, level, reference, system, simon, baron, cohen, 1999, argues, that, theory, of, mind, must, have, preceded, language, use, based, on, evidence, of, use, of, the, following, characteristics, as, much, as, 40, 000, years, ago, intentional, communication, repairing, failed, communication, teaching, intentional, persuasion, intentional, deception, building, shared, plans, and, goals, intentional, sharing, of, focus, or, topic, and, pretending, moreover, baron, cohen, argues, that, many, primates, show, some, but, not, all, of, these, abilities, call, and, tomasello, s, research, on, chimpanzees, supports, this, in, that, individual, chimps, seem, to, understand, that, other, chimps, have, awareness, knowledge, and, intention, but, do, not, seem, to, understand, false, beliefs, many, primates, show, some, tendencies, toward, a, theory, of, mind, but, not, a, full, one, as, humans, have, ultimately, there, is, some, consensus, within, the, field, that, a, theory, of, mind, is, necessary, for, language, use, thus, the, development, of, a, full, theory, of, mind, in, humans, was, a, necessary, precursor, to, full, language, use, in, one, particular, study, rats, and, pigeons, were, required, to, press, a, button, a, certain, number, of, times, to, get, food, the, animals, showed, very, accurate, distinction, for, numbers, less, than, four, but, as, the, numbers, increased, the, error, rate, increased, in, another, the, primatologist, tetsuro, matsuzawa, attempted, to, teach, chimpanzees, arabic, numerals, the, difference, between, primates, and, humans, in, this, regard, was, very, large, as, it, took, the, chimps, thousands, of, trials, to, learn, 1, 9, with, each, number, requiring, a, similar, amount, of, training, time, yet, after, learning, the, meaning, of, 1, 2, and, 3, and, sometimes, 4, children, after, the, age, of, 5, 5, to, 6, easily, comprehend, the, value, of, greater, integers, by, using, a, successor, function, i, e, 2, is, 1, greater, than, 1, 3, is, 1, greater, than, 2, 4, is, 1, greater, than, 3, once, 4, is, reached, it, seems, most, children, suddenly, understand, that, the, value, of, any, integer, n, is, 1, greater, than, the, previous, integer, put, simply, other, primates, learn, the, meaning, of, numbers, one, by, one, similar, to, their, approach, to, other, referential, symbols, while, children, first, learn, an, arbitrary, list, of, symbols, 1, 2, 3, 4, and, then, later, learn, their, precise, meanings, these, results, can, be, seen, as, evidence, for, the, application, of, the, open, ended, generative, property, of, language, in, human, numeral, cognition, hockett, 1966, details, a, list, of, features, regarded, as, essential, to, describing, human, language, in, the, domain, of, the, lexical, phonological, principle, two, features, of, this, list, are, most, important, the, sound, system, of, a, language, is, composed, of, a, finite, set, of, simple, phonological, items, under, the, specific, phonotactic, rules, of, a, given, language, these, items, can, be, recombined, and, concatenated, giving, rise, to, morphology, and, the, open, ended, lexicon, a, key, feature, of, language, is, that, a, simple, finite, set, of, phonological, items, gives, rise, to, an, infinite, lexical, system, wherein, rules, determine, the, form, of, each, item, and, meaning, is, inextricably, linked, with, form, phonological, syntax, then, is, a, simple, combination, of, pre, existing, phonological, units, related, to, this, is, another, essential, feature, of, human, language, lexical, syntax, wherein, pre, existing, units, are, combined, giving, rise, to, semantically, novel, or, distinct, lexical, items, certain, elements, of, the, lexical, phonological, principle, are, known, to, exist, outside, of, humans, while, all, or, nearly, all, have, been, documented, in, some, form, in, the, natural, world, very, few, coexist, within, the, same, species, bird, song, singing, nonhuman, apes, and, the, songs, of, whales, all, display, phonological, syntax, combining, units, of, sound, into, larger, structures, apparently, devoid, of, enhanced, or, novel, meaning, certain, other, primate, species, do, have, simple, phonological, systems, with, units, referring, to, entities, in, the, world, however, in, contrast, to, human, systems, the, units, in, these, primates, systems, normally, occur, in, isolation, betraying, a, lack, of, lexical, syntax, there, is, new, evidence, to, suggest, that, campbell, s, monkeys, also, display, lexical, syntax, combining, two, calls, a, predator, alarm, call, with, a, boom, the, combination, of, which, denotes, a, lessened, threat, of, danger, however, it, is, still, unclear, whether, this, is, a, lexical, or, a, morphological, phenomenon, pidgins, are, significantly, simplified, languages, with, only, rudimentary, grammar, and, a, restricted, vocabulary, in, their, early, stage, pidgins, mainly, consist, of, nouns, verbs, and, adjectives, with, few, or, no, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, or, auxiliary, verbs, often, the, grammar, has, no, fixed, word, order, and, the, words, have, no, inflection, if, contact, is, maintained, between, the, groups, speaking, the, pidgin, for, long, periods, of, time, the, pidgins, may, become, more, complex, over, many, generations, if, the, children, of, one, generation, adopt, the, pidgin, as, their, native, language, it, develops, into, a, creole, language, which, becomes, fixed, and, acquires, a, more, complex, grammar, with, fixed, phonology, syntax, morphology, and, syntactic, embedding, the, syntax, and, morphology, of, such, languages, may, often, have, local, innovations, not, obviously, derived, from, any, of, the, parent, languages, studies, of, creole, languages, around, the, world, have, suggested, that, they, display, remarkable, similarities, in, grammar, and, are, developed, uniformly, from, pidgins, in, a, single, generation, these, similarities, are, apparent, even, when, creoles, do, not, have, any, common, language, origins, in, addition, creoles, are, similar, despite, being, developed, in, isolation, from, each, other, syntactic, similarities, include, subject, verb, object, word, order, even, when, creoles, are, derived, from, languages, with, a, different, word, order, they, often, develop, the, svo, word, order, creoles, tend, to, have, similar, usage, patterns, for, definite, and, indefinite, articles, and, similar, movement, rules, for, phrase, structures, even, when, the, parent, languages, do, not, field, primatologists, can, give, useful, insights, into, great, ape, communication, in, the, wild, one, notable, finding, is, that, nonhuman, primates, including, the, other, great, apes, produce, calls, that, are, graded, as, opposed, to, categorically, differentiated, with, listeners, striving, to, evaluate, subtle, gradations, in, signallers, emotional, and, bodily, states, nonhuman, apes, seemingly, find, it, extremely, difficult, to, produce, vocalisations, in, the, absence, of, the, corresponding, emotional, states, in, captivity, nonhuman, apes, have, been, taught, rudimentary, forms, of, sign, language, or, have, been, persuaded, to, use, lexigrams, symbols, that, do, not, graphically, resemble, the, corresponding, words, on, computer, keyboards, some, nonhuman, apes, such, as, kanzi, have, been, able, to, learn, and, use, hundreds, of, lexigrams, the, broca, s, and, wernicke, s, areas, in, the, primate, brain, are, responsible, for, controlling, the, muscles, of, the, face, tongue, mouth, and, larynx, as, well, as, recognizing, sounds, primates, are, known, to, make, vocal, calls, and, these, calls, are, generated, by, circuits, in, the, brainstem, and, limbic, system, in, the, wild, the, communication, of, vervet, monkeys, has, been, the, most, extensively, studied, they, are, known, to, make, up, to, ten, different, vocalizations, many, of, these, are, used, to, warn, other, members, of, the, group, about, approaching, predators, they, include, a, leopard, call, a, snake, call, and, an, eagle, call, each, call, triggers, a, different, defensive, strategy, in, the, monkeys, who, hear, the, call, and, scientists, were, able, to, elicit, predictable, responses, from, the, monkeys, using, loudspeakers, and, prerecorded, sounds, other, vocalisations, may, be, used, for, identification, if, an, infant, monkey, calls, its, mother, turns, toward, it, but, other, vervet, mothers, turn, instead, toward, that, infant, s, mother, to, see, what, she, will, do, similarly, researchers, have, demonstrated, that, chimpanzees, in, captivity, use, different, words, in, reference, to, different, foods, they, recorded, vocalisations, that, chimps, made, in, reference, for, example, to, grapes, and, then, other, chimps, pointed, at, pictures, of, grapes, when, they, heard, the, recorded, sound, a, study, published, in, homo, journal, of, comparative, human, biology, in, 2017, claims, that, ardipithecus, ramidus, a, hominin, dated, at, approximately, 4, 5, ma, shows, the, first, evidence, of, an, anatomical, shift, in, the, hominin, lineage, suggestive, of, increased, vocal, capability, this, study, compared, the, skull, of, a, ramidus, with, 29, chimpanzee, skulls, of, different, ages, and, found, that, in, numerous, features, a, ramidus, clustered, with, the, infant, and, juvenile, measures, as, opposed, to, the, adult, measures, such, affinity, with, the, shape, dimensions, of, infant, and, juvenile, chimpanzee, skull, architecture, it, was, argued, may, have, resulted, in, greater, vocal, capability, this, assertion, was, based, on, the, notion, that, the, chimpanzee, vocal, tract, ratios, that, prevent, speech, are, a, result, of, growth, factors, associated, with, puberty, growth, factors, absent, in, a, ramidus, ontogeny, a, ramidus, was, also, found, to, have, a, degree, of, cervical, lordosis, more, conducive, to, vocal, modulation, when, compared, with, chimpanzees, as, well, as, cranial, base, architecture, suggestive, of, increased, vocal, capability, what, was, significant, in, this, study, according, to, the, authors, was, the, observation, that, the, changes, in, skull, architecture, that, correlate, with, reduced, aggression, are, the, same, changes, necessary, for, the, evolution, of, early, hominin, vocal, ability, in, integrating, data, on, anatomical, correlates, of, primate, mating, and, social, systems, with, studies, of, skull, and, vocal, tract, architecture, that, facilitate, speech, production, the, authors, argue, that, paleoanthropologists, prior, to, their, study, have, failed, to, understand, the, important, relationship, between, early, hominin, social, evolution, and, the, evolution, of, our, species, capacities, for, language, while, the, skull, of, a, ramidus, according, to, the, authors, lacks, the, anatomical, impediments, to, speech, evident, in, chimpanzees, it, is, unclear, what, the, vocal, capabilities, of, this, early, hominin, were, while, they, suggest, a, ramidus, based, on, similar, vocal, tract, ratios, may, have, had, vocal, capabilities, equivalent, to, a, modern, human, infant, or, very, young, child, they, concede, this, is, a, debatable, and, speculative, hypothesis, however, they, do, claim, that, changes, in, skull, architecture, through, processes, of, social, selection, were, a, necessary, prerequisite, for, language, evolution, as, they, write, we, propose, that, as, a, result, of, paedomorphic, morphogenesis, of, the, cranial, base, and, craniofacial, morphology, ar, ramidus, would, have, not, been, limited, in, terms, of, the, mechanical, components, of, speech, production, as, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, are, it, is, possible, that, ar, ramidus, had, vocal, capability, approximating, that, of, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, with, its, idiosyncratic, skull, morphology, not, resulting, in, any, significant, advances, in, speech, capability, in, this, sense, the, anatomical, features, analysed, in, this, essay, would, have, been, exapted, in, later, more, voluble, species, of, hominin, however, given, the, selective, advantages, of, pro, social, vocal, synchrony, we, suggest, the, species, would, have, developed, significantly, more, complex, vocal, abilities, than, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, anatomically, some, scholars, believe, that, features, of, bipedalism, developed, in, the, australopithecines, around, 3, 5, million, years, ago, around, this, time, these, structural, developments, within, the, skull, led, to, a, more, prominently, l, shaped, vocal, tract, in, order, to, generate, the, sounds, modern, homo, sapiens, are, capable, of, making, such, as, vowels, it, is, vital, that, early, homo, populations, must, have, a, specifically, shaped, voice, track, and, a, lower, sitting, larynx, opposing, research, previously, suggested, that, neanderthals, were, physically, incapable, of, creating, the, full, range, of, vocals, seen, in, modern, humans, due, to, the, differences, in, larynx, placement, establishing, distinct, larynx, positions, through, fossil, remains, of, homo, sapiens, and, neanderthals, would, support, this, theory, however, modern, research, has, revealed, that, the, hyoid, bone, was, indistinguishable, in, the, two, populations, though, research, has, shown, a, lower, sitting, larynx, is, important, to, producing, speech, another, theory, states, it, may, not, be, as, important, as, once, thought, cataldo, migliano, and, vinicius, report, speech, alone, appears, inadequate, for, transmiting, stone, tool, making, knowledge, and, suggest, that, speech, may, have, emerged, due, to, an, increase, in, complex, social, interactions, steven, mithen, proposed, the, term, hmmmmm, for, the, pre, linguistic, system, of, communication, posited, to, have, been, used, by, archaic, homo, beginning, with, homo, ergaster, and, reaching, the, highest, sophistication, in, the, middle, pleistocene, with, homo, heidelbergensis, and, homo, neanderthalensis, hmmmmm, is, an, acronym, for, h, olistic, non, compositional, m, anipulative, utterances, are, commands, or, suggestions, not, descriptive, statements, m, ulti, m, odal, acoustic, as, well, as, gestural, and, facial, m, usical, and, m, imetic, evidence, for, homo, erectus, potentially, using, language, comes, in, the, form, of, acheulean, tool, usage, the, use, of, abstract, thought, in, the, formation, of, acheulean, hand, axes, coincides, with, the, symbol, creation, necessary, for, simple, language, recent, language, theories, present, recursion, as, the, unique, facet, of, human, language, and, theory, of, mind, however, breaking, down, language, into, its, symbolic, parts, separating, meaning, from, the, requirements, of, grammar, it, becomes, possible, to, see, that, language, does, not, depend, on, either, recursion, or, grammar, this, can, be, evidenced, by, the, pirah, language, users, in, brazil, that, have, no, myth, or, creation, stories, no, numbers, and, no, colors, within, their, language, this, is, to, highlight, that, even, though, grammar, may, have, been, unavailable, use, of, foresight, planning, and, symbolic, thought, can, be, evidence, of, language, as, early, as, one, million, years, ago, with, homo, erectus, homo, heidelbergensis, was, a, close, relative, most, probably, a, migratory, descendant, of, homo, ergaster, some, researchers, believe, this, species, to, be, the, first, hominin, to, make, controlled, vocalisations, possibly, mimicking, animal, vocalisations, and, that, as, homo, heidelbergensis, developed, more, sophisticated, culture, proceeded, from, this, point, and, possibly, developed, an, early, form, of, symbolic, language, the, discovery, in, 1989, of, the, neanderthal, kebara, 2, hyoid, bone, suggests, that, neanderthals, may, have, been, anatomically, capable, of, producing, sounds, similar, to, modern, humans, the, hypoglossal, nerve, which, passes, through, the, hypoglossal, canal, controls, the, movements, of, the, tongue, which, may, have, enabled, voicing, for, size, exaggeration, see, size, exaggeration, hypothesis, below, or, may, reflect, speech, abilities, however, although, neanderthals, may, have, been, anatomically, able, to, speak, richard, g, klein, in, 2004, doubted, that, they, possessed, a, fully, modern, language, he, largely, bases, his, doubts, on, the, fossil, record, of, archaic, humans, and, their, stone, tool, kit, bart, de, boer, in, 2017, acknowledges, this, ambiguity, of, a, universally, accepted, neanderthal, vocal, tract, however, he, notes, the, similarities, in, the, thoracic, vertebral, canal, potential, air, sacs, and, hyoid, bones, between, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, to, suggest, the, presence, of, complex, speech, for, two, million, years, following, the, emergence, of, homo, habilis, the, stone, tool, technology, of, hominins, changed, very, little, klein, who, has, worked, extensively, on, ancient, stone, tools, describes, the, crude, stone, tool, kit, of, archaic, humans, as, impossible, to, break, down, into, categories, based, on, their, function, and, reports, that, neanderthals, seem, to, have, had, little, concern, for, the, final, aesthetic, form, of, their, tools, klein, argues, that, the, neanderthal, brain, may, have, not, reached, the, level, of, complexity, required, for, modern, speech, even, if, the, physical, apparatus, for, speech, production, was, well, developed, the, issue, of, the, neanderthal, s, level, of, cultural, and, technological, sophistication, remains, a, controversial, one, based, on, computer, simulations, used, to, evaluate, that, evolution, of, language, that, resulted, in, showing, three, stages, in, the, evolution, of, syntax, neanderthals, are, thought, to, have, been, in, stage, 2, showing, they, had, something, more, evolved, than, proto, language, but, not, quite, as, complex, as, the, language, of, modern, humans, some, researchers, applying, auditory, bioengineering, models, to, computerised, tomography, scans, of, neanderthal, skulls, have, asserted, that, neanderthals, had, auditory, capacity, very, similar, to, that, of, anatomically, modern, humans, these, researchers, claim, that, this, finding, implies, that, neanderthals, evolved, the, auditory, capacities, to, support, a, vocal, communication, system, as, efficient, as, modern, human, speech, anatomically, modern, humans, begin, to, appear, in, the, fossil, record, in, ethiopia, some, 200, 000, years, ago, although, there, is, still, much, debate, as, to, whether, behavioural, modernity, emerged, in, africa, at, around, the, same, time, a, growing, number, of, archaeologists, nowadays, invoke, the, southern, african, middle, stone, age, use, of, red, ochre, pigments, for, example, at, blombos, cave, as, evidence, that, modern, anatomy, and, behaviour, co, evolved, these, archaeologists, argue, strongly, that, if, modern, humans, at, this, early, stage, were, using, red, ochre, pigments, for, ritual, and, symbolic, purposes, they, probably, had, symbolic, language, as, well, according, to, the, recent, african, origins, hypothesis, from, around, 60, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, a, group, of, humans, left, africa, and, began, migrating, to, occupy, the, rest, of, the, world, carrying, language, and, symbolic, culture, with, them, the, larynx, or, voice, box, is, an, organ, in, the, neck, housing, the, vocal, folds, which, are, responsible, for, phonation, in, humans, the, larynx, is, descended, the, human, species, is, not, unique, in, this, respect, goats, dogs, pigs, and, tamarins, lower, the, larynx, temporarily, to, emit, loud, calls, several, deer, species, have, a, permanently, lowered, larynx, which, may, be, lowered, still, further, by, males, during, their, roaring, displays, lions, jaguars, cheetahs, and, domestic, cats, also, do, this, however, laryngeal, descent, in, nonhumans, according, to, philip, lieberman, is, not, accompanied, by, descent, of, the, hyoid, hence, the, tongue, remains, horizontal, in, the, oral, cavity, preventing, it, from, acting, as, a, pharyngeal, articulator, despite, all, this, scholars, remain, divided, as, to, how, special, the, human, vocal, tract, really, is, it, has, been, shown, that, the, larynx, does, descend, to, some, extent, during, development, in, chimpanzees, followed, by, hyoidal, descent, as, against, this, philip, lieberman, points, out, that, only, humans, have, evolved, permanent, and, substantial, laryngeal, descent, in, association, with, hyoidal, descent, resulting, in, a, curved, tongue, and, two, tube, vocal, tract, with, 1, 1, proportions, he, argues, that, neanderthals, and, early, anatomically, modern, humans, could, not, have, possessed, supralaryngeal, vocal, tracts, capable, of, producing, fully, human, speech, uniquely, in, the, human, case, simple, contact, between, the, epiglottis, and, velum, is, no, longer, possible, disrupting, the, normal, mammalian, separation, of, the, respiratory, and, digestive, tracts, during, swallowing, since, this, entails, substantial, costs, increasing, the, risk, of, choking, while, swallowing, food, we, are, forced, to, ask, what, benefits, might, have, outweighed, those, costs, the, obvious, benefit, so, it, is, claimed, must, have, been, speech, but, this, idea, has, been, vigorously, contested, one, objection, is, that, humans, are, in, fact, not, seriously, at, risk, of, choking, on, food, medical, statistics, indicate, that, accidents, of, this, kind, are, extremely, rare, another, objection, is, that, in, the, view, of, most, scholars, speech, as, it, is, known, emerged, relatively, late, in, human, evolution, roughly, contemporaneously, with, the, emergence, of, homo, sapiens, a, development, as, complex, as, the, reconfiguration, of, the, human, vocal, tract, would, have, required, much, more, time, implying, an, early, date, of, origin, this, discrepancy, in, timescales, undermines, the, idea, that, human, vocal, flexibility, was, initially, driven, by, selection, pressures, for, speech, thus, not, excluding, that, it, was, selected, for, e, g, improved, singing, ability, to, lower, the, larynx, is, to, increase, the, length, of, the, vocal, tract, in, turn, lowering, formant, frequencies, so, that, the, voice, sounds, deeper, giving, an, impression, of, greater, size, john, ohala, argues, that, the, function, of, the, lowered, larynx, in, humans, especially, males, is, probably, to, enhance, threat, displays, rather, than, speech, itself, ohala, points, out, that, if, the, lowered, larynx, were, an, adaptation, for, speech, adult, human, males, would, be, expected, to, be, better, adapted, in, this, respect, than, adult, females, whose, larynx, is, considerably, less, low, however, females, outperform, males, in, verbal, tests, falsifying, this, whole, line, of, reasoning, w, tecumseh, fitch, likewise, argues, that, this, was, the, original, selective, advantage, of, laryngeal, lowering, in, the, human, species, although, according, to, fitch, the, initial, lowering, of, the, larynx, in, humans, had, nothing, to, do, with, speech, the, increased, range, of, possible, formant, patterns, was, subsequently, co, opted, for, speech, size, exaggeration, remains, the, sole, function, of, the, extreme, laryngeal, descent, observed, in, male, deer, consistent, with, the, size, exaggeration, hypothesis, a, second, descent, of, the, larynx, occurs, at, puberty, in, humans, although, only, in, males, in, response, to, the, objection, that, the, larynx, is, descended, in, human, females, fitch, suggests, that, mothers, vocalizing, to, protect, their, infants, would, also, have, benefited, from, this, ability, in, 2011, quentin, atkinson, published, a, survey, of, phonemes, from, 500, different, languages, as, well, as, language, families, and, compared, their, phonemic, diversity, by, region, number, of, speakers, and, distance, from, africa, the, survey, revealed, that, african, languages, had, the, largest, number, of, phonemes, and, oceania, and, south, america, had, the, smallest, number, after, allowing, for, the, number, of, speakers, the, phonemic, diversity, was, compared, to, over, 2000, possible, origin, locations, atkinson, s, best, fit, model, is, that, language, originated, in, western, central, or, southern, africa, between, 80, 000, and, 160, 000, years, ago, this, predates, the, hypothesized, southern, coastal, peopling, of, arabia, india, southeast, asia, and, australia, it, would, also, mean, that, the, origin, of, language, occurred, at, the, same, time, as, the, emergence, of, symbolic, culture, numerous, linguists, have, criticized, atkinson, s, paper, as, misrepresenting, both, the, phonemic, data, and, processes, of, linguistic, change, as, language, complexity, does, not, necessarily, correspond, to, age, and, of, failing, to, take, into, account, the, borrowing, of, phonemes, from, neighbouring, languages, as, some, bantu, languages, have, done, with, click, consonants, recreations, of, his, method, gave, possible, origins, of, language, in, the, caucasus, and, turkmenistan, in, addition, to, southern, and, eastern, africa, the, search, for, the, origin, of, language, has, a, long, history, in, mythology, most, mythologies, do, not, credit, humans, with, the, invention, of, language, but, speak, of, a, divine, language, predating, human, language, mystical, languages, used, to, communicate, with, animals, or, spirits, such, as, the, language, of, the, birds, are, also, common, and, were, of, particular, interest, during, the, renaissance, v, c, is, the, hindu, goddess, of, speech, or,

xochiquetzal, survived, a, flood, having, floated, on, a, piece, of, bark, they, found, themselves, on, land, and, had, many, children, who, were, at, first, born, unable, to, speak, but, subsequently, upon, the, arrival, of, a, dove, were, endowed, with, language, although, each, one, was, given, a, different, speech, such, that, they, could, not, understand, one, another, in, the,

speaking, different, languages, after, this, they, migrated, to, other, regions, grouped, together, according, to, which, of, the, newly, created, languages, they, spoke, explaining, the, origins, of, languages, and, nations, outside, of, the, fertile, crescent, history, contains, a, number, of, anecdotes, about, people, who, attempted, to, discover, the, origin, of, language, by, experiment, the, first, such, tale, was, told, by, herodotus, histories, 2, 2, he, relates, that, pharaoh, psammetichus, probably, psammetichus, i, 7th, century, bc, had, two, children, raised, by, a, shepherd, with, the, instructions, that, no, one, should, speak, to, them, but, that, the, shepherd, should, feed, and, care, for, them, while, listening, to, determine, their, first, words, when, one, of, the, children, cried, bekos, with, outstretched, arms, the, shepherd, concluded, that, the, word, was, phrygian, because, that, was, the, sound, of, the, phrygian, word, for, bread, from, this, psammetichus, concluded, that, the, first, language, was, phrygian, king, james, v, of, scotland, is, said, to, have, tried, a, similar, experiment, his, children, were, supposed, to, have, spoken, hebrew, both, the, medieval, monarch, frederick, ii, and, akbar, are, said, to, have, tried, similar, experiments, the, children, involved, in, these, experiments, did, not, speak, the, current, situation, of, deaf, people, also, points, into, this, direction, modern, linguistics, did, not, begin, until, the, late, 18th, century, and, the, romantic, or, animist, theses, of, johann, gottfried, herder, and, johann, christoph, adelung, remained, influential, well, into, the, 19th, century, the, question, of, language, origin, seemed, inaccessible, to, methodical, approaches, and, in, 1866, the, linguistic, society, of, paris, famously, banned, all, discussion, of, the, origin, of, language, deeming, it, to, be, an, unanswerable, problem, an, increasingly, systematic, approach, to, historical, linguistics, developed, in, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, reaching, its, culmination, in, the, neogrammarian, school, of, karl, brugmann, and, others, however, scholarly, interest, in, the, question, of, the, origin, of, language, has, only, gradually, been, rekindled, from, the, 1950s, on, and, then, controversially, with, ideas, such, as, universal, grammar, mass, comparison, and, glottochronology, the, origin, of, language, as, a, subject, in, its, own, right, emerged, from, studies, in, neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and, human, evolution, the, linguistic, bibliography, introduced, origin, of, language, as, a, separate, heading, in, 1988, as, a, sub, topic, of, psycholinguistics, dedicated, research, institutes, of, evolutionary, linguistics, are, a, recent, phenomenon, emerging, only, in, the, 1990s
