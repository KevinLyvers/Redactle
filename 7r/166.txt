intentions, alongside, the, related, holiday, of, rosh, hashanah, yom, kippur, is, one, of, the, two, components, of, the, high, holy, days, of, judaism, it, is, also, the, last, of, the, ten, days, of, repentance, the, formal, hebrew, name, of, the, holiday, is, yom, hakippurim, day, the, atonements, this, name, is, used, in, the, bible, mishnah, and, shulchan, aruch, the, word, kippurim, atonement, is, one, of, many, biblical, hebrew, words, which, while, using, a, grammatical, plural, form, refers, to, a, singular, abstract, concept, beginning, in, the, classical, period, the, singular, form, kippur, began, to, be, used, in, piyyut, for, example, in, unetanneh, tokef, alongside, the, standard, plural, form, kippurim, use, of, kippur, spread, in, the, medieval, period, with, yom, kippur, becoming, the, holiday, s, name, in, yiddish, and, kippur, in, ladino, in, modern, hebrew, yom, kippur, or, simply, kippur, is, the, common, name, while, yom, hakippurim, is, used, in, formal, writing, in, older, english, texts, the, translation, day, of, atonement, is, often, used, yom, kippur, is, one, of, the, two, high, holy, days, or, days, of, awe, hebrew, yamim, noraim, alongside, rosh, hashanah, which, falls, nine, days, previously, according, to, jewish, tradition, on, rosh, hashanah, god, inscribes, each, person, s, fate, for, the, coming, year, into, the, book, of, life, and, waits, until, yom, kippur, to, seal, the, verdict, this, process, is, described, dramatically, in, the, poem, unetanneh, tokef, which, is, recited, on, rosh, hashanah, and, yom, kippur, a, great, shofar, will, be, blown, and, a, small, still, voice, will, be, heard, the, angels, will, make, haste, and, be, seized, with, fear, and, trembling, and, will, say, behold, the, day, of, judgment, on, rosh, hashanah, it, is, written, and, on, the, yom, kippur, fast, it, is, sealed, how, many, will, pass, and, how, many, will, be, created, who, will, live, and, who, will, die, who, in, his, time, and, who, not, in, his, time, but, repentance, prayer, and, charity, remove, the, evil, of, the, decree, for, you, do, not, desire, a, person, s, death, but, rather, that, he, repent, and, live, until, the, day, of, his, death, you, wait, for, him, if, he, repents, you, accept, him, immediately, during, the, days, of, awe, a, jew, reflects, on, the, year, goals, and, past, actions, how, his, or, her, behavior, has, possibly, hurt, others, and, seek, forgiveness, for, wrongs, done, against, god, and, against, other, human, beings, repentance, in, judaism, hebrew, teshuva, traditionally, consists, of, regretting, having, committed, the, sin, resolving, not, to, commit, that, sin, in, the, future, and, confessing, that, sin, before, god, while, repentance, for, one, s, sins, can, and, should, be, done, at, any, time, it, is, considered, especially, desirable, during, the, ten, days, of, repentance, between, rosh, hashana, and, yom, kippur, and, particularly, on, yom, kippur, itself, thus, the, yom, kippur, prayers, contain, extended, confessions, which, list, varieties, of, errors, and, sins, and, to, which, one, can, add, their, own, missteps, along, with, requests, for, forgiveness, from, god, according, to, the, talmud, yom, kippur, atones, for, sins, done, against, god, bein, adam, lemakom, but, does, not, atone, for, sins, done, against, other, human, beings, bein, adam, lechavero, until, the, other, person, has, been, appeased, therefore, it, is, considered, imperative, to, repair, the, harm, that, one, has, done, to, others, before, or, during, yom, kippur, yom, kippur, is, described, in, the, prayers, as, a, day, of, creating, love, and, brotherhood, a, day, of, abandoning, jealousy, and, strife, it, is, said, that, if, one, does, not, remove, hatred, on, yom, kippur, their, prayers, are, not, heard, according, to, the, bible, after, the, golden, calf, sin, moses, descended, from, mount, sinai, and, broke, the, tablets, of, stone, which, contained, the, ten, commandments, and, symbolized, the, covenant, with, god, after, god, agreed, to, forgive, the, people, s, sin, moses, was, told, to, return, to, mount, sinai, for, a, second, 40, day, period, in, order, to, receive, a, second, set, of, tablets, according, to, rabbinic, tradition, the, date, moses, descended, with, the, second, set, of, tablets, was, yom, kippur, on, this, day, moses, announced, to, the, people, that, they, had, been, forgiven, as, a, result, the, torah, fixed, this, date, as, a, permanent, holiday, of, forgiveness, the, new, covenant, which, god, announced, by, proclaiming, the, thirteen, attributes, of, mercy, to, moses, is, textually, similar, to, the, covenant, of, the, ten, commandments, except, that, god, s, nature, is, described, as, merciful, and, forgiving, rather, than, zealous, when, the, jewish, people, sinned, in, later, eras, prophets, would, repeatedly, quote, the, thirteen, attributes, to, god, as, a, reminder, of, god, s, commitment, to, mercy, and, forgiveness, this, is, continued, to, the, present, day, as, recitation, of, the, thirteen, attributes, remains, an, important, part, of, the, yom, kippur, prayers, in, maariv, and, neilah, while, many, of, the, observances, of, yom, kippur, such, as, fasting, and, long, prayers, can, be, difficult, there, is, also, a, tradition, in, which, they, are, interpreted, positively, as, indications, of, closeness, of, god, various, sources, compare, the, observances, of, yom, kippur, fasting, barefootness, not, wearing, leather, shoes, standing, in, prayer, particular, manners, of, prayer, even, the, peace, that, exists, between, jews, on, this, day, with, the, behavior, of, angels, suggesting, that, on, yom, kippur, jews, become, like, angels, in, heaven, purified, and, close, to, god, and, not, limited, by, physicality, yom, kippur, was, also, unique, as, a, time, of, closeness, to, god, in, the, yom, kippur, temple, service, yom, kippur, was, the, only, occasion, on, which, the, high, priest, of, israel, was, allowed, to, enter, the, holy, of, holies, the, innermost, chamber, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, where, god, s, presence, was, said, to, dwell, on, yom, kippur, the, high, priest, entered, the, holy, of, holies, several, times, first, to, create, a, cloud, of, incense, smoke, in, which, the, bible, promises, god, would, reveal, himself, without, being, seen, and, later, to, offer, sacrifices, of, atonement, while, the, encounter, with, god, and, the, atonement, may, appear, to, be, unrelated, in, fact, they, are, mutually, dependent, on, one, hand, the, priest, is, only, worthy, to, approach, god, when, in, a, state, of, purity, with, the, sins, of, the, people, being, forgiven, on, the, other, hand, only, by, approaching, god, with, an, intimate, personal, request, can, god, be, persuaded, to, abandon, justice, for, mercy, permitting, the, purification, to, take, place, according, to, the, torah, the, yom, kippur, temple, service, was, commanded, in, wake, of, the, deaths, of, nadab, and, abihu, on, the, eighth, day, of, the, tabernacle, inauguration, not, only, was, this, eighth, day, the, occasion, of, the, yom, kippur, command, but, the, eighth, day, was, also, similar, in, its, nature, to, yom, kippur, both, in, biblical, texts, e, g, the, sacrifices, offered, on, each, day, and, in, rabbinic, interpretation, the, purpose, of, the, eighth, day, was, the, revelation, of, god, s, presence, to, the, people, 14, similarly, the, yom, kippur, service, was, a, unique, opportunity, for, the, people, s, representative, to, obtain, closeness, with, god, a, midrash, compares, the, yom, kippur, prayers, to, a, verse, from, the, song, of, songs, describing, a, woman, who, rises, from, bed, at, night, to, begin, a, romantic, encounter, with, her, lover, with, each, yom, kippur, prayer, it, is, implied, jews, approach, closer, to, god, i, rose, up, to, open, to, my, beloved, my, hands, dripped, with, myrrh, my, fingers, with, flowing, myrrh, upon, the, handles, of, the, bolt, song, of, songs, 5, 5, i, rose, up, to, open, to, my, beloved, this, refers, to, yotzer, my, hands, dripped, with, myrrh, this, refers, to, mussaf, my, fingers, with, flowing, myrrh, this, refers, to, mincha, upon, the, handles, of, the, bolt, this, refers, to, neilah, using, a, similar, metaphor, the, mishnah, describes, yom, kippur, as, a, wedding, date, as, on, this, date, moses, returned, having, reestablished, the, covenant, between, god, and, israel, along, with, tu, b, av, yom, kippur, was, historically, considered, one, of, the, two, happiest, days, of, the, jewish, year, for, on, this, day, jews, receive, forgiveness, for, their, sins, and, on, this, date, the, covenant, with, god, was, reestablished, in, leviticus, 16, 30, the, torah, summarizes, the, purpose, of, yom, kippur, as, follows, for, on, this, day, atonement, shall, be, made, for, you, to, purify, you, from, all, your, sins, before, the, lord, you, shall, be, purified, there, are, two, forms, of, impurity, in, judaism, see, tumah, and, taharah, ritual, impurity, e, g, when, one, touches, a, corpse, and, moral, impurity, when, one, commits, a, serious, sin, while, the, yom, kippur, temple, service, did, purify, the, temple, if, it, had, become, ritually, impure, the, emphasis, of, the, day, is, on, the, jewish, people, s, purification, from, moral, impurity, leviticus, 16, 30, mentions, purification, twice, according, to, netziv, the, first, mention, is, a, promise, that, god, will, purify, israel, on, this, day, while, the, second, is, a, command, calling, on, israel, to, purify, themselves, through, repentance, thus, on, this, day, jews, do, their, utmost, to, repent, but, if, by, the, end, of, the, day, they, have, reached, the, limits, of, their, ability, and, are, still, morally, flawed, god, extends, them, forgiveness, and, purification, anyway, jeremiah, 17, 13, states, that, israel, s, hope, mikveh, is, in, god, according, to, rabbi, akiva, this, verse, alludes, to, a, ritual, purification, bath, also, pronounced, mikveh, and, thus, on, yom, kippur, god, metaphorically, becomes, a, mikveh, in, which, israel, immerses, and, purifies, itself, this, idea, is, symbolized, by, immersion, in, an, actual, mikveh, in, the, yom, kippur, temple, service, the, high, priest, would, immerse, upon, putting, on, and, taking, off, his, white, yom, kippur, garments, the, rabbis, counted, no, fewer, than, five, immersions, over, the, course, of, the, day, s, service, among, modern, day, jews, too, there, is, a, custom, of, immersion, before, yom, kippur, though, not, on, yom, kippur, itself, as, bathing, is, forbidden, in, normal, circumstances, when, the, scapegoat, was, selected, on, yom, kippur, to, symbolically, carry, the, people, s, sins, to, the, desert, a, crimson, cord, was, tied, around, its, horns, while, the, practical, purpose, of, this, cord, was, to, distinguish, the, scapegoat, from, the, goat, which, was, to, be, slaughtered, it, also, symbolized, the, sin, which, the, scapegoat, was, carrying, away, isaiah, 1, 18, promises, that, if, the, jewish, people, repents, if, sins, are, like, crimson, they, shall, become, white, as, snow, according, to, tradition, in, some, years, the, scapegoat, s, cord, would, miraculously, turn, white, to, indicate, that, the, people, s, sins, were, forgiven, and, purification, achieved, in, that, year, yom, kippur, is, considered, a, day, of, jewish, unity, in, kol, nidre, in, which, vows, are, released, vows, of, excommunication, against, sinning, jews, were, similarly, lifted, and, these, transgressors, were, allowed, to, pray, alongside, other, jews, according, to, the, talmud, any, fast, in, which, jewish, sinners, do, not, also, participate, is, not, a, valid, fast, similarly, the, mishnah, describes, yom, kippur, as, a, day, on, which, men, and, women, would, once, meet, each, other, in, the, vineyards, in, order, to, arrange, marriages, while, this, story, is, surprising, given, the, generally, somber, nature, of, the, day, it, is, based, on, the, biblical, episode, where, the, oath, against, marrying, benjaminites, was, circumvented, by, allowing, them, to, take, women, from, the, vineyards, as, wives, and, thus, indicates, the, day, s, theme, of, abandoning, grudges, in, order, for, the, jewish, people, to, be, reunited, 29, 30, as, one, of, the, most, culturally, significant, jewish, holidays, yom, kippur, is, observed, by, many, secular, jews, who, may, not, observe, other, holidays, many, secular, jews, attend, synagogue, on, yom, kippur, for, many, secular, jews, the, high, holy, days, are, the, only, times, of, the, year, during, which, they, attend, synagogue, causing, synagogue, attendance, to, soar, on, the, day, preceding, yom, kippur, known, as, erev, yom, kippur, lit, eve, day, atonement, a, number, of, activities, are, customarily, performed, in, preparation, for, yom, kippur, these, activities, generally, relate, to, the, themes, of, the, holiday, but, are, forbidden, or, impractical, to, do, on, yom, kippur, itself, according, to, the, talmud, yom, kippur, does, not, atone, for, sins, between, a, person, and, his, fellow, until, he, has, appeased, his, fellow, thus, it, is, common, practice, on, erev, yom, kippur, to, request, forgiveness, from, other, individuals, for, misdeeds, one, has, done, to, them, the, talmud, records, no, less, than, 14, stories, attesting, to, the, importance, of, the, day, for, repairing, relationships, with, one, s, spouses, parents, children, coworkers, the, poor, and, other, individuals, the, day, before, a, major, jewish, holiday, is, often, devoted, towards, preparing, for, that, holiday, as, with, burning, chametz, before, passover, or, obtaining, the, four, species, before, sukkot, for, yom, kippur, the, appropriate, preparation, is, to, seek, forgiveness, from, one, s, fellow, man, nevertheless, one, should, not, ask, forgiveness, if, this, will, cause, further, harm, for, example, by, bringing, up, an, insult, the, victim, was, unaware, of, according, to, halakha, one, must, eat, on, erev, yom, kippur, a, variety, of, reasons, have, been, suggested, for, this, requirement, among, them, many, orthodox, men, immerse, themselves, in, a, mikveh, on, this, day, opinions, differ, on, whether, this, is, a, technical, act, to, remove, ritual, impurity, or, else, a, symbolic, one, to, symbolize, one, s, cleansing, from, sin, on, yom, kippur, the, kapparot, ritual, in, which, either, money, or, a, chicken, is, given, to, charity, is, performed, by, some, on, erev, yom, kippur, as, a, means, to, enhance, atonement, in, this, day, s, morning, prayer, service, shacharit, additional, selichot, prayers, are, recited, in, the, afternoon, prayer, mincha, the, long, confession, is, recited, just, as, it, is, on, yom, kippur, itself, this, confession, is, recited, before, the, last, erev, yom, kippur, meal, the, separation, meal, in, hebrew, se, udah, hamafseket, or, aruha, hamafseket, in, case, one, becomes, intoxicated, at, this, meal, and, is, unable, to, confess, properly, afterwards, or, else, because, a, person, might, choke, to, death, at, that, meal, and, die, without, confessing, seemingly, an, unlikely, possibility, but, one, which, reminds, a, person, of, their, mortality, the, torah, commands, jews, to, afflict, themselves, ve, initem, et, nafshoteichem, on, yom, kippur, while, these, verses, do, not, explicitly, mention, the, form, of, affliction, the, phrase, afflicting, oneself, frequently, appears, elsewhere, in, connection, with, fasting, or, lack, of, food, and, public, fast, days, for, repentance, were, a, common, practice, in, biblical, times, according, to, the, jewish, oral, tradition, the, yom, kippur, affliction, consists, of, the, following, five, prohibitions, in, traditional, custom, the, fast, is, required, of, males, over, age, 13, and, females, over, age, 12, however, fasting, is, waived, in, the, case, of, dangerous, medical, conditions, pikuach, nefesh, and, in, such, a, case, one, is, actually, required, to, break, the, fast, just, as, it, is, a, mitzvah, to, fast, on, yom, kippur, it, may, also, be, a, mitzvah, to, eat, or, drink, on, yom, kippur, to, safeguard, a, person, s, health, in, such, situations, though, it, is, preferable, if, the, medical, situation, allows, for, it, to, consume, only, small, amounts, of, food, or, drink, at, a, time, fasting, along, with, the, other, restrictions, begins, at, sundown, and, ends, after, nightfall, the, following, day, one, should, add, a, few, minutes, to, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, day, called, tosefet, yom, kippur, lit, addition, to, yom, kippur, yom, kippur, is, the, only, day, when, fasting, is, permitted, on, shabbat, a, number, of, different, interpretations, of, these, restrictions, have, been, suggested, in, one, approach, fasting, replaces, animal, sacrifices, fasting, causes, one, s, fat, and, blood, to, be, diminished, just, as, the, fat, and, blood, of, a, sacrifice, were, burned, on, the, altar, thus, the, fast, is, a, form, of, sacrifice, which, can, atone, for, sin, like, the, temple, sacrifices, once, did, other, approaches, suggest, that, the, prohibitions, represent, not, suffering, but, rather, special, holiness, for, example, on, yom, kippur, jews, are, said, to, become, like, angels, just, as, angels, do, not, need, to, eat, drink, or, wear, shoes, so, too, jews, do, not, engage, on, these, activities, on, yom, kippur, by, detaching, themselves, from, physical, needs, jews, become, purified, and, resemble, angels, similarly, the, prohibitions, allude, to, the, experience, of, moses, on, mount, sinai, who, did, not, eat, or, drink, while, receiving, the, torah, and, while, receiving, forgiveness, for, the, people, s, sins, similarly, the, prohibitions, have, been, interpreted, as, a, return, to, the, purity, of, the, biblical, garden, of, eden, upon, leaving, eden, shoes, became, necessary, for, the, first, time, thorns, and, thistles, will, grow, in, your, way, the, snake, will, raise, its, head, to, bite, you, and, you, will, give, your, heel, to, crush, it, thus, on, yom, kippur, jews, do, not, wear, leather, shoes, while, in, eden, food, and, drink, were, easily, obtained, but, after, the, expulsion, man, must, work, for, food, by, the, sweat, of, brow, thus, food, and, drink, are, refrained, from, on, yom, kippur, as, well, as, washing, and, the, use, of, cosmetics, to, remove, sweat, or, its, odor, in, eden, death, was, unknown, and, procreation, unnecessary, similarly, on, yom, kippur, marital, relations, are, avoided, according, to, maimonides, the, purpose, of, fasting, and, the, restriction, on, work, is, to, remove, distractions, from, the, task, of, repentance, by, refraining, from, these, activities, the, body, is, uncomfortable, but, can, still, survive, the, soul, is, considered, to, be, the, life, force, in, a, body, therefore, by, making, one, s, body, uncomfortable, one, s, soul, is, uncomfortable, by, feeling, pain, one, can, feel, how, others, feel, when, they, are, in, pain, the, torah, calls, yom, kippur, a, day, of, rest, shabbat, shabbaton, on, which, work, is, prohibited, thus, the, activities, forbidden, on, shabbat, are, also, forbidden, on, yom, kippur, the, 39, categories, of, work, as, well, as, the, rabbinic, shabbat, prohibitions, wearing, white, clothing, is, traditional, to, symbolize, one, s, purity, on, this, day, various, reasons, have, been, suggested, for, this, custom, many, ashkenazi, jewish, men, wear, a, kittel, which, in, addition, to, being, white, symbolizes, the, seriousness, of, god, s, judgment, on, this, day, as, the, deceased, are, buried, wearing, kittels, yom, kippur, is, honored, in, the, same, ways, as, shabbat, and, other, holidays, to, the, extent, permitted, thus, the, house, is, cleaned, ahead, of, time, and, the, table, covered, with, a, nice, tablecloth, even, though, it, will, not, be, used, for, eating, the, synagogue, is, cleaned, ahead, of, time, and, all, the, lights, left, on, one, bathes, before, yom, kippur, and, clean, clothes, are, worn, smelling, pleasant, smells, is, allowed, on, yom, kippur, so, many, make, a, point, of, smelling, pleasant, spices, throughout, the, day, candles, are, lit, just, before, yom, kippur, as, is, done, before, shabbat, it, is, traditional, for, parents, to, give, their, children, a, special, blessing, before, beginning, the, yom, kippur, prayers, those, whose, parents, have, died, light, a, yahrzeit, candle, in, their, memory, before, yom, kippur, begins, following, the, fast, sephardic, jewish, communities, traditionally, serve, a, drink, made, from, melon, seeds, similar, to, the, turkish, s, bye, turkish, jews, refer, to, it, as, subiye, while, greek, jews, call, it, pepitada, this, is, followed, by, coffee, with, milk, and, biscochos, savory, ring, shaped, cookies, pieces, of, bread, dipped, in, olive, oil, and, za, atar, alongside, tomato, and, later, chicken, cooked, with, dry, quinces, or, plums, the, yom, kippur, prayer, service, includes, several, unique, aspects, one, is, the, number, of, prayer, services, unlike, a, regular, day, which, has, three, prayer, services, shacharit, mincha, and, maariv, or, a, shabbat, or, yom, tov, which, has, four, prayer, services, those, three, plus, mussaf, yom, kippur, has, five, prayer, services, those, four, plus, ne, ila, the, closing, prayer, the, prayer, services, also, include, private, and, public, confessions, of, sins, vidui, and, a, unique, prayer, dedicated, to, the, special, yom, kippur,

also, used, in, eastern, european, communities, by, men, on, their, wedding, day, they, also, wear, a, tallit, prayer, shawl, which, is, typically, worn, only, during, morning, services, before, the, beginning, of, yom, kippur, many, jews, recite, the, optional, tefillah, zakkah, the, pure, prayer, in, which, among, other, topics, one, declares, that, they, forgive, anyone, who, has, harmed, them, in, the, past, except, for, damages, which, can, be, recovered, in, court, and, except, for, those, who, say, i, will, harm, him, and, he, will, forgive, me, asks, god, not, to, punish, anyone, who, has, been, so, forgiven, and, asks, god, to, show, similar, graciousness, in, forgiving, their, own, sins, like, all, jewish, holidays, yom, kippur, begins, in, the, evening, and, the, evening,
