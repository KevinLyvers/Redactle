arabian, peninsula, north, africa, the, levant, and, mesopotamia, iraq, the, bedouin, originated, in, the, syrian, desert, and, arabian, desert, but, spread, across, the, rest, of, the, arab, world, in, west, asia, and, north, africa, after, the, spread, of, islam, the, english, word, bedouin, comes, from, the, arabic, badaw, which, means, desert, dweller, and, is, traditionally, contrasted, with, ir, the, term, for, sedentary, people, bedouin, territory, stretches, from, the, vast, deserts, of, north, africa, to, the, rocky, ones, of, the, middle, east, they, are, sometimes, traditionally, divided, into, tribes, or, clans, known, in, arabic, as, a, ir, or, qab, il, and, historically, share, a, common, culture, of, herding, camels, sheep, and, goats, the, vast, majority, of, bedouins, adhere, to, islam, although, there, are, some, fewer, numbers, of, christian, bedouins, present, in, the, fertile, crescent, bedouins, have, been, referred, to, by, various, names, throughout, history, including, arabaa, by, the, assyrians, ar, ba, ea, being, a, nisba, of, the, noun, arab, a, name, still, used, for, bedouins, today, they, are, referred, to, as, the, a, r, b, a,

traditional, a, ir, clan, structure, traditional, music, poetry, dances, such, as, saas, and, many, other, cultural, practices, and, concepts, some, urbanized, bedouins, often, organise, cultural, festivals, usually, held, several, times, a, year, in, which, they, gather, with, other, bedouins, to, partake, in, and, learn, about, various, bedouin, traditions, from, poetry, recitation, and, traditional, sword, dances, to, playing, traditional, instruments, and, even, classes, teaching, traditional, tent, knitting, traditions, like, camel, riding, and, camping, in, the, deserts, are, still, popular, leisure, activities, for, urban, bedouins, who, live, in, close, proximity, to, deserts, or, other, wilderness, areas, a, widely, quoted, bedouin, apothegm, is, i, am, against, my, brother, my, brother, and, i, are, against, my, cousin, my, cousin, and, i, are, against, the, stranger, sometimes, quoted, as, i, and, my, brother, are, against, my, cousin, i, and, my, cousin, are, against, the, stranger, this, saying, signifies, a, hierarchy, of, loyalties, based, on, the, proximity, of, some, person, to, oneself, beginning, with, the, self, and, proceeding, through, the, nuclear, family, as, defined, by, male, kinship, and, then, in, principle, at, least, to, an, entire, genetic, or, linguistic, group, which, is, perceived, as, akin, to, kinship, in, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, generally, disputes, are, settled, interests, are, pursued, and, justice, and, order, are, dispensed, and, maintained, by, means, of, this, framework, organized, according, to, an, ethic, of, self, help, and, collective, responsibility, andersen, 14, the, individual, family, unit, referred, to, as, a, tent, or, bayt, usually, traditionally, comprised, three, or, four, adults, a, married, couple, plus, siblings, or, parents, and, any, number, of, children, the, bedouins, ethos, comprises, courage, hospitality, loyalty, to, family, and, pride, of, ancestry, bedouin, tribes, were, not, controlled, by, a, central, power, like, a, government, or, empire, but, rather, were, led, by, tribal, chiefs, some, chiefs, exercised, their, power, from, oases, where, merchants, would, organise, trade, through, the, territory, controlled, by, the, tribe, the, structure, of, bedouin, tribes, were, held, together, more, so, by, shared, feelings, of, common, ancestry, rather, than, a, tribal, chief, atop, the, hierarchy, when, resources, were, plentiful, several, tents, would, travel, together, as, a, goum, while, these, groups, were, sometimes, linked, by, patriarchal, lineage, others, were, just, as, likely, linked, by, marriage, alliances, new, wives, were, especially, likely, to, have, close, male, relatives, join, them, sometimes, the, association, was, based, on, acquaintance, and, familiarity, or, even, no, clearly, defined, relation, except, for, simple, shared, membership, within, a, tribe, the, next, scale, of, interaction, within, groups, was, the, ibn, amm, cousin, or, literally, son, of, paternal, uncle, or, descent, group, commonly, of, three, to, five, generations, these, were, often, linked, to, goums, but, where, a, goum, would, generally, consist, of, people, all, with, the, same, herd, type, descent, groups, were, frequently, split, up, over, several, economic, activities, thus, allowing, a, degree, of, risk, management, should, one, group, of, members, of, a, descent, group, suffer, economically, the, other, members, of, the, descent, group, would, be, able, to, support, them, whilst, the, phrase, descent, group, suggests, purely, a, lineage, based, arrangement, in, reality, these, groups, were, fluid, and, adapted, their, genealogies, to, take, in, new, members, the, largest, scale, of, tribal, interactions, is, the, tribe, as, a, whole, led, by, a, sheikh, arabic, ay, literally, old, man, though, the, title, refers, to, leaders, in, varying, contexts, the, tribe, often, claims, descent, from, one, common, ancestor, as, mentioned, above, the, tribal, level, is, the, level, that, mediated, between, the, bedouin, and, the, outside, governments, and, organizations, distinct, structure, of, the, bedouin, society, leads, to, long, lasting, rivalries, between, different, clans, bedouin, traditionally, had, strong, honor, codes, and, traditional, systems, of, justice, dispensation, in, bedouin, society, typically, revolved, around, such, codes, the, bisha, a, or, ordeal, by, fire, is, a, well, known, bedouin, practice, of, lie, detection, see, also, honor, codes, of, the, bedouin, bedouin, systems, of, justice, livestock, and, herding, principally, of, goats, sheep, and, dromedary, camels, comprised, the, traditional, livelihoods, of, bedouins, these, were, used, for, meat, dairy, products, and, wool, most, of, the, staple, foods, that, made, up, the, bedouins, diet, were, dairy, products, camels, in, particular, had, numerous, cultural, and, functional, uses, having, been, regarded, as, a, gift, from, god, they, were, the, main, food, source, and, method, of, transportation, for, many, bedouins, in, addition, to, their, extraordinary, milking, potentials, under, harsh, desert, conditions, their, meat, was, occasionally, consumed, by, bedouins, as, a, cultural, tradition, camel, races, were, organized, during, celebratory, occasions, such, as, weddings, or, religious, festivals, some, bedouin, societies, live, in, arid, regions, in, areas, where, rainfall, is, very, unpredictable, a, camp, will, be, moved, irregularly, depending, on, the, availability, of, green, pasture, where, winter, rainfall, is, more, predictable, in, regions, further, south, some, bedouin, people, plant, grain, along, their, migration, routes, this, proves, a, resource, for, the, livestock, throughout, the, winter, in, regions, such, as, western, africa, where, there, is, more, predictable, rainfall, the, bedouin, practice, transhumance, they, plant, crops, near, permanent, homes, in, the, valleys, where, there, is, more, rain, and, move, their, livestock, to, the, highland, pastures, oral, poetry, is, the, most, popular, art, form, among, bedouins, having, a, poet, in, one, s, tribe, was, highly, regarded, in, society, in, addition, to, serving, as, a, form, of, art, poetry, was, used, as, a, means, of, conveying, information, and, social, control, bedouin, poetry, also, known, as, nabati, poetry, is, often, recited, in, the, vernacular, dialect, in, contrast, the, more, common, forms, of, arabic, poetry, are, often, in, modern, standard, arabic, the, well, regulated, traditional, habit, of, bedouin, tribes, of, raiding, other, tribes, caravans, or, settlements, is, known, in, arabic, as, ghazw, historically, the, bedouin, engaged, in, nomadic, herding, agriculture, and, sometimes, fishing, in, the, syrian, steppe, since, 6000, bce, by, about, 850, bce, a, complex, network, of, settlements, and, camps, was, established, the, earliest, arab, tribes, emerged, from, bedouins, by, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, s, establishment, the, bedouin, national, identity, had, been, established, and, they, were, recognizable, as, a, single, people, with, often, warring, families, clans, and, tribes, a, major, source, of, income, for, this, people, was, the, taxation, of, caravans, and, tributes, collected, from, non, bedouin, settlements, they, also, earned, income, by, transporting, goods, and, people, in, caravans, pulled, by, domesticated, camels, across, the, desert, scarcity, of, water, and, of, permanent, pastoral, land, required, them, to, move, constantly, the, moroccan, traveller, ibn, battuta, reported, that, in, 1326, on, the, route, to, gaza, the, egyptian, authorities, had, a, customs, post, at, qatya, on, the, north, coast, of, sinai, here, bedouin, were, being, used, to, guard, the, road, and, track, down, those, trying, to, cross, the, border, without, permission, the, early, medieval, grammarians, and, scholars, seeking, to, develop, a, system, of, standardizing, the, contemporary, classical, arabic, for, maximal, intelligibility, across, the, arabophone, areas, believed, that, the, bedouin, spoke, the, purest, most, conservative, variety, of, the, language, to, solve, irregularities, of, pronunciation, the, bedouin, were, asked, to, recite, certain, poems, whereafter, consensus, was, relied, on, to, decide, the, pronunciation, and, spelling, of, a, given, word, a, plunder, and, massacre, of, the, hajj, caravan, by, bedouin, tribesmen, occurred, in, 1757, led, by, qa, dan, al, fayez, of, the, bani, sakhr, tribe, modern, day, jordan, in, his, vengeance, against, the, ottomans, for, failing, to, pay, his, tribe, for, their, help, protecting, the, pilgrims, an, estimated, 20, 000, pilgrims, were, either, killed, in, the, raid, or, died, of, hunger, or, thirst, as, a, result, including, relatives, of, the, sultan, and, musa, pasha, although, bedouin, raids, on, hajj, caravans, were, fairly, common, the, 1757, raid, represented, the, peak, of, such, attacks, which, was, also, likely, prompted, by, the, major, drought, of, 1756, under, the, tanzimat, land, reforms, of, 1858, a, new, ottoman, land, law, was, issued, which, offered, legal, grounds, for, the, displacement, of, the, bedouin, turkish, bedeviler, as, the, ottoman, empire, gradually, lost, power, this, law, instituted, an, unprecedented, land, registration, process, that, was, also, meant, to, boost, the, empire, s, tax, base, few, bedouin, opted, to, register, their, lands, with, the, ottoman, tapu, due, to, lack, of, enforcement, by, the, ottomans, illiteracy, refusal, to, pay, taxes, and, lack, of, relevance, of, written, documentation, of, ownership, to, the, bedouin, way, of, life, at, that, time, some, scholars, such, as, nora, elizabeth, barakat, believe, the, displacement, of, the, bedouin, had, its, roots, in, events, even, earlier, than, the, 1858, land, reforms, for, example, in, an, 1844, anatolia, specific, decree, recognizing, the, tribe, as, a, formal, unit, of, administration, the, goal, of, these, early, reforms, was, to, weaken, local, bedouin, magistrates, and, limit, what, she, terms, as, rural, mobility, the, ability, of, these, local, bedouins, to, independently, of, the, ottoman, state, accumulate, wealth, through, the, wheat, trade, and, other, means, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, sultan, abd, lhamid, ii, settled, muslim, populations, circassians, from, the, balkan, and, caucasus, among, areas, predominantly, populated, by, the, nomads, in, the, regions, of, modern, syria, lebanon, jordan, and, israel, and, also, created, several, permanent, bedouin, settlements, although, the, majority, of, them, did, not, remain, the, settlement, of, non, arabs, in, the, traditionally, bedouin, areas, was, a, big, cause, of, discontent, this, became, even, severe, because, every, arab, tribe, including, the, settled, ones, have, ancestry, as, a, bedouin, ottoman, authorities, also, initiated, private, acquisition, of, large, plots, of, state, land, offered, by, the, sultan, to, the, absentee, landowners, effendis, numerous, tenants, were, brought, in, order, to, cultivate, the, newly, acquired, lands, often, it, came, at, the, expense, of, the, bedouin, lands, in, the, late, 19th, century, many, bedouin, began, transition, to, a, semi, nomadic, lifestyle, one, of, the, factors, was, the, influence, of, the, ottoman, empire, authorities, who, started, a, forced, sedentarization, of, the, bedouin, living, on, its, territory, the, ottoman, authorities, viewed, the, bedouin, as, a, threat, to, the, state, s, control, and, worked, hard, on, establishing, law, and, order, in, the, negev, during, the, first, world, war, the, negev, bedouin, initially, fought, with, the, ottomans, against, the, british, however, under, the, influence, of, british, agent, t, e, lawrence, the, bedouins, switched, side, and, fought, against, the, ottomans, hamad, pasha, al, sufi, died, 1923, sheikh, of, the, nijmat, sub, tribe, of, the, tarabin, led, a, force, of, 1, 500, men, who, joined, the, ottoman, raid, on, the, suez, canal, in, orientalist, historiography, the, negev, bedouin, have, been, described, as, remaining, largely, unaffected, by, changes, in, the, outside, world, until, recently, their, society, was, often, considered, a, world, without, time, recent, scholars, have, challenged, the, notion, of, the, bedouin, as, fossilized, or, stagnant, reflections, of, an, unchanging, desert, culture, emanuel, marx, has, shown, that, bedouin, were, engaged, in, a, constantly, dynamic, reciprocal, relation, with, urban, centers, bedouin, scholar, michael, meeker, explains, that, the, city, was, to, be, found, in, their, midst, at, the, time, of, world, war, i, a, qays, bedouin, tribe, from, harran, not, far, from, urfa, settled, in, l, leburgaz, in, east, thrace, under, their, last, sheikh, salih, abdullah, it, is, said, that, this, tribe, was, originally, from, tihamah, ghazzu, was, still, relevant, to, the, bedouin, lifestyle, in, the, early, 20th, century, after, a, 1925, stay, with, sheikh, mithqal, al, fayez, of, the, bani, sakher, william, seabrook, wrote, about, his, experience, of, a, ghazzu, from, the, sardieh, tribe, on, mithqal, s, 500, hejin, racing, camels, the, ghazzu, was, intercepted, by, mithqal, when, he, was, notified, about, the, sardieh, tribe, s, intentions, from, a, man, from, the, bani, hassan, tribe, who, rode, continuously, for, over, 30, hours, to, reach, mithqal, before, their, plot, matured, mithqal, using, the, information, prepared, a, trap, for, them, which, resulted, in, the, imprisonment, of, one, of, the, sardieh, warriors, william, notes, that, although, the, warrior, was, a, prisoner, he, was, nonchalant, and, was, not, treated, aggressively, and, that, the, ghazzu, wasn, t, a, war, but, a, game, in, which, camels, and, goats, were, the, prizes, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, large, numbers, of, bedouin, throughout, midwest, asia, started, to, leave, the, traditional, nomadic, life, to, settle, in, the, cities, of, midwest, asia, especially, as, hot, ranges, shrank, and, populations, grew, for, example, in, syria, the, bedouin, way, of, life, effectively, ended, during, a, severe, drought, from, 1958, to, 1961, which, forced, many, bedouin, to, abandon, herding, for, standard, jobs, similarly, governmental, policies, in, egypt, israel, jordan, iraq, tunisia, oil, producing, arab, states, of, the, persian, gulf, and, libya, as, well, as, a, desire, for, improved, standards, of, living, effectively, led, most, bedouin, to, become, settled, citizens, of, various, nations, rather, than, stateless, nomadic, herders, governmental, policies, pressing, the, bedouin, have, in, some, cases, been, executed, in, an, attempt, to, provide, service, schools, health, care, law, enforcement, and, so, on, see, chatty, 1986, for, examples, but, in, others, have, been, based, on, the, desire, to, seize, land, traditionally, roved, and, controlled, by, the, bedouin, in, recent, years, some, bedouin, have, adopted, the, pastime, of, raising, and, breeding, white, doves, while, others, have, rejuvenated, the, traditional, practice, of, falconry, the, arabian, peninsula, was, one, of, the, original, homes, of, the, bedouin, from, there, they, started, to, spread, out, to, surrounding, deserts, forced, out, by, the, lack, of, water, and, food, according, to, tradition, arabian, bedouin, tribes, are, descendants, of, two, groups, qahtanis, also, known, as, yaman, who, originate, from, the, mountains, of, southwestern, arabia, and, claim, descent, from, a, semi, legendary, ancestral, figure, qahtan, often, linked, to, the, biblical, joktan, and, adnanis, also, known, as, qays, who, originate, in, north, central, arabia, and, claimed, descent, from, adnan, a, descendant, of, the, biblical, ishmael, a, number, of, bedouin, tribes, reside, in, saudi, arabia, among, them, are, anazzah, juhaynah, shammar, al, murrah, mahra, dawasir, harb, ghamid, mutayr, subay, utayba, bani, khalid, qahtan, rashaida, and, banu, yam, in, arabia, and, the, adjacent, deserts, there, are, around, 100, large, tribes, of, 1, 000, members, or, more, some, tribes, number, up, to, 20, 000, and, a, few, of, the, larger, tribes, may, have, up, to, 100, 000, members, inside, saudi, arabia, the, bedouin, remained, the, majority, of, the, population, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, saudi, arabia, pursued, a, policy, of, sedentarization, in, the, early, 20th, century, which, was, initially, linked, with, the, establishment, of, the, ikhwan, as, a, result, of, this, policy, and, subsequent, modernization, the, number, of, bedouin, that, retain, their, nomadic, lifestyle, has, decreased, rapidly, according, to, ali, al, naimi, the, bedouin, or, bedu, would, travel, in, family, and, tribal, groups, across, the, arabian, peninsula, in, groups, of, fifty, to, a, hundred, a, clan, was, composed, of, a, number, of, families, while, a, number, of, clans, formed, a, tribe, tribes, would, have, areas, reserved, for, their, livestock, called, dirahs, which, included, wells, for, their, exclusive, use, they, lived, in, black, goat, hair, tents, called, bayt, al, shar, divided, by, cloth, curtains, into, rug, floor, areas, for, males, family, and, cooking, in, hofuf, they, bartered, their, sheep, goats, and, camels, including, milk, and, wool, for, grain, and, other, staples, al, naimi, also, quotes, paul, harrison, s, observation, of, the, bedouin, there, seems, to, be, no, limit, at, all, to, their, endurance, the, syrian, desert, was, the, original, homeland, of, the, arab, bedouin, tribes, which, have, been, mentioned, as, far, back, as, the, neo, assyrian, era, where, they, re, referred, to, by, tiglath, pileser, iii, as, being, among, the, syrians, integrated, into, the, assyrian, administrative, system, today, there, are, over, a, million, bedouin, living, in, syria, making, a, living, herding, sheep, and, goats, the, largest, bedouin, clan, in, syria, is, called, ruwallah, who, are, part, of, the, anizzah, tribe, another, famous, branch, of, the, anizzah, tribe, is, the, two, distinct, groups, of, hasana, and, s, baa, who, largely, arrived, from, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, 18th, century, herding, among, the, bedouin, was, common, until, the, late, 1950s, when, it, effectively, ended, during, a, severe, drought, from, 1958, to, 1961, due, to, the, drought, many, bedouin, were, forced, to, give, up, herding, for, standard, jobs, another, factor, was, the, formal, annulling, of, the, bedouin, tribes, legal, status, in, syrian, law, in, 1958, along, with, attempts, of, the, ruling, ba, ath, party, regime, to, wipe, out, tribalism, preferences, for, customary, law, urf, in, contrast, to, state, law, qanun, have, been, informally, acknowledged, and, tolerated, by, the, state, in, order, to, avoid, having, its, authority, tested, in, the, tribal, territories, in, 1982, the, al, assad, family, turned, to, the, bedouin, tribe, leaders, for, assistance, during, the, muslim, brotherhood, uprising, against, al, assad, government, see, 1982, hama, massacre, the, bedouin, sheikhs, decision, to, support, hafez, al, assad, led, to, a, change, in, attitude, on, the, part, of, the, government, that, permitted, the, bedouin, leadership, to, manage, and, transform, critical, state, development, efforts, supporting, their, own, status, customs, and, leadership, as, a, result, of, the, syrian, civil, war, some, bedouins, became, refugees, and, found, shelter, in, jordan, turkey, lebanon, and, other, states, palestinian, bedouins, were, originally, from, the, negev, desert, in, the, course, of, the, 1948, palestine, war, they, fled, or, were, displaced, from, their, land, other, bedouins, were, expelled, from, the, negev, in, 1953, and, had, relocated, to, the, west, bank, which, at, the, time, belonged, to, jordan, today, there, are, 40, 000, bedouins, in, the, whole, of, the, west, bank, including, 27, 000, people, under, israeli, military, control,

to, accommodate, the, growth, of, illegal, israeli, settlements, on, the, outskirts, of, east, jerusalem, bedouins, also, live, in, the, gaza, strip, including, 5, 000, in, om, al, nasr, however, the, number, of, nomadic, bedouins, is, shrinking, and, many, are, now, settled, prior, to, the, 1948, israeli, declaration, of, independence, an, estimated, 65, 000, 90, 000, bedouins, lived, in, the, negev, desert, according, to, encyclopedia, judaica, 15, 000, bedouin, remained, in, the, negev, after, 1948, other, sources, put, the, number, as, low, as, 11, 000, another, source, states, that, in, 1999, 110, 000, bedouins, lived, in, the, negev, 50, 000, in, the, galilee, and, 10, 000, in, the, central, region, of, israel, all, of, the, bedouins, residing, in, israel, were, granted, israeli,

after, 1948, some, negev, bedouins, were, displaced, the, jahalin, tribe, for, instance, lived, in, the, tel, arad, region, of, the, negev, prior, to, the, 1950s, in, the, early, 1950s, the, jahalin, were, among, the, tribes, that, according, to, emanuel, marx, moved, or, were, removed, by, the, military, government, they, ended, up, in, the, so, called, e1, area, east, of, jerusalem, about, 1,

into, consideration, local, infrastructure, these, communities, are, scattered, all, over, the, northern, negev, and, often, are, situated, in, inappropriate, places, such, as, military, fire, zones, natural, reserves, landfills, etc, on, 29, september, 2003, israeli, government, adapted, a, new, abu, basma, plan, resolution, 881, according, to, which, a, new, regional, council, was, formed,

cash, benefits, which, has, contributed, to, the, high, birth, rate, among, the, bedouin, of, 5, per, year, but, unemployment, rate, remains, very, high, and, few, obtain, a, high, school, degree, 4, and, even, fewer, graduate, from, university, 0, 6, in, september, 2011, the, israeli, government, approved, a, five, year, economic, development, plan, called, the, prawer, plan, one, of, its, implications, is, a, relocation, of, some, 30, 000, 40, 000, negev, bedouin, from, areas, not, recognized, by, the, government, to, government, approved, townships, in, a, 2012, resolution, the,

to, improve, its, standard, of, living, shamir, claimed, that, without, intervention, the, bedouin, population, could, exceed, half, a, million, by, 2035, in, may, 2015, the, united, nations, office, for, the, coordination, of, humanitarian, affairs, and, the, united, nations, relief, and, works, agency, for, palestine, refugees, have, combined, forces, both, organizations, called, on, israel, to, stop, its, plans, to, relocate, bedouin, communities, currently, living, in, the, west, bank, to, land, outside, of, jerusalem, for, better, access, to, infrastructure, health, and, education, officials, stated, that, a, forcible, transfer, of, over, 7000, bedouin, people, would, destroy, their, culture, and, livelihoods, most, of, the, bedouin, tribes, migrated, from, the, arabian, peninsula, to, what, is, jordan, today, between, the, 14th, and, 18th, centuries, they, are, often, referred, to, as, a, backbone, of, the, kingdom, since, bedouin, clans, traditionally, support, the, monarchy, most, of, jordan, s, bedouin, live, in, the, vast, wasteland, that, extends, east, from, the, desert, highway, the, eastern, bedouin, are, camel, breeders, and, herders, while, the, western, bedouin, herd, sheep, and, goats, some, bedouin, in, jordan, are, semi, nomads, they, adopt, a, nomadic, existence, during, part, of, the, year, but, return, to, their, lands, and, homes, in, time, to, practice, agriculture, the, largest, nomadic, groups, of, jordan, are, the, bani, hasan, mafraq, zarqa, jarash, ajloun, and, parts, of, amman, bani, akher, amman, and, madaba, ban, laith, petra, and, ban, al, uway, t, they, reside, in, wadi, rum, there, are, numerous, lesser, groups, such, as, the, al, sir, n, ban, kh, lid, hawazim, a, iyyah, and, sharaf, t, the, ruw, lah, rwala, tribe, which, is, not, indigenous, passes, through, jordan, in, its, yearly, wandering, from, syria, to, saudi, arabia, the, region, encompassing, wadi, musa, and, petra, is, inhabited, by, the, prominent, liyathnah, tribe, alongside, the, smaller, bedul, community, believed, to, have, jewish, or, nabataean, ancestry, the, jordanian, government, provides, the, bedouin, with, different, services, such, as, education, housing, and, health, clinics, however, some, bedouins, give, it, up, and, prefer, their, traditional, nomadic, lifestyle, in, the, recent, years, there, is, a, growing, discontent, of, the, bedouin, with, the, ruling, monarch, abdullah, ii, of, jordan, in, august, 2007, police, clashed, with, some, 200, bedouins, who, were, blocking, the, main, highway, between, amman, and, the, port, of, aqaba, livestock, herders, were, protesting, the, government, s, lack, of, support, in, the, face, of, the, steeply, rising, cost, of, animal, feed, and, expressed, resentment, about, government, assistance, to, refugees, arab, spring, events, in, 2011, led, to, demonstrations, in, jordan, and, bedouins, took, part, in, them, but, the, hashemites, did, not, see, a, revolt, similar, to, turbulence, in, other, arab, states, the, main, reasons, for, that, are, the, high, respect, to, the, monarch, and, contradictory, interests, of, different, groups, of, the, jordanian, society, the, king, abdullah, ii, maintains, his, distance, from, the, complaints, by, allowing, blame, to, fall, on, government, ministers, whom, he, replaces, at, will, the, arab, migration, to, the, maghreb, had, been, a, centuries, long, process, that, continuously, occurred, since, the, 7th, century, the, initial, waves, of, migration, from, the, 7th, to, the, 10th, centuries, mostly, involved, sedentary, arabs, who, established, communities, in, cities, towns, and, surrounding, rural, areas, however, the, arab, migrations, from, the, 11th, to, the, 15th, centuries, involved, a, significant, influx, of, a, great, amount, of, nomadic, bedouin, tribes, to, the, region, in, the, 11th, century, the, bedouin, tribes, of, banu, hilal, and, banu, sulaym, who, originated, from, central, and, north, arabia, respectively, living, at, the, time, in, a, desert, between, the, nile, and, the, red, sea, moved, westward, into, the, maghreb, areas, and, were, joined, by, the, bedouin, tribe, of, ma, qil, which, had, its, roots, in, south, arabia, as, well, as, other, arab, tribes, the, 11th, century, witnessed, the, most, significant, wave, of, arab, migration, surpassing, all, previous, movements, this, event, unfolded, when, the, zirid, dynasty, of, ifriqiya, proclaimed, its, independence, from, the, fatimid, caliphate, of, egypt, in, retribution, against, the, zirids, the, fatimids, dispatched, large, bedouin, arab, tribes, mainly, the, banu, hilal, and, banu, sulaym, to, defeat, the, zirids, and, settle, in, the, maghreb, these, tribes, followed, a, nomadic, lifestyle, and, were, originally, from, the, hejaz, and, najd, they, were, later, joined, by, the, bedouin, tribe, of, ma, qil, which, had, its, roots, in, south, arabia, as, well, as, other, arab, tribes, according, to, ibn, khaldun, they, were, accompanied, by, their, wives, children, and, stock, they, settled, in, the, maghreb, after, repeatedly, fighting, battles, against, the, berbers, such, as, the, battle, of, haydaran, they, heavily, transformed, the, culture, of, the, maghreb, into, arab, culture, and, spread, nomadism, in, areas, where, agriculture, was, previously, dominant, it, played, a, major, role, in, spreading, bedouin, arabic, to, rural, areas, such, as, the, countryside, and, steppes, and, as, far, as, the, southern, areas, near, the, sahara, in, addition, they, destroyed, the, berber, zirid, state, and, most, of, its, cities, sparing, only, the, mediterranean, coastal, strip, at, al, mahdiyya, and, deeply, weakened, the, neighboring, hammadid, dynasty, and, the, zenata, their, influx, was, a, major, factor, in, the, linguistic, cultural, genetic, and, ethnic, arabization, of, the, maghreb, according, to, ibn, khaldun, the, lands, ravaged, by, banu, hilal, invaders, had, become, desertified, and, turned, into, completely, arid, desert, the, journey, of, banu, hilal, is, recounted, in, the, arabic, oral, poem, of, sirat, bani, hilal, to, persuade, the, banu, hilal, and, banu, sulaym, to, migrate, to, the, maghreb, the, fatimid, caliph, gave, each, tribesman, a, camel, and, money, and, helped, them, cross, from, the, east, to, the, west, bank, of, the, nile, river, the, severe, drought, in, egypt, at, the, time, also, persuaded, these, tribes, to, migrate, to, the, maghreb, which, had, a, better, economic, situation, at, the, time, the, fatimid, caliph, instructed, them, to, rule, the, maghreb, instead, of, the, zirid, emir, al, mu, izz, and, told, them, i, have, given, you, the, maghrib, and, the, rule, of, al, mu, izz, ibn, balk, n, as, sanh, j, the, runaway, slave, you, will, want, for, nothing, and, told, al, mu, izz, i, have, sent, you, horses, and, put, brave, men, on, them, so, that, god, might, accomplish, a, matter, already, enacted, berber, armies, were, defeated, in, trying, to, protect, the, walls, of, kairouan, the, zirids, abandoned, kairouan, to, take, refuge, on, the, coast, where, they, survived, for, a, century, ifriqiya, the, banu, hilal, and, banu, sulaym, spread, is, on, the, high, plains, of, constantine, where, they, gradually, choked, the, qal, a, of, banu, hammad, as, they, had, done, kairouan, few, decades, ago, from, there, they, gradually, gained, the, upper, algiers, and, oran, plains, some, were, taken, to, the, moulouya, valley, and, in, doukkala, plains, by, the, caliph, of, marrakesh, in, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, ibn, khaldun, a, muslim, historian, wrote, similar, to, an, army, of, locusts, they, destroy, everything, in, their, path, as, arab, nomads, spread, the, territories, of, the, local, berber, tribes, were, moved, and, shrank, the, zenata, were, pushed, to, the, west, and, the, kabyles, were, pushed, to, the, north, the, berbers, took, refuge, in, the, mountains, whereas, the, plains, were, arabized, the, arrival, of, the, banu, hilal, followed, by, the, banu, sulaym, in, the, 12th, century, broke, the, balance, between, nomads, and, sedentary, populations, in, favor, of, the, nomads, for, strategic, reasons, the, almohads, gave, over, the, atlantic, plains, of, the, western, maghreb, to, them, sources, estimated, that, the, total, number, of, arab, nomads, who, migrated, to, the, maghreb, only, in, the, 11th, century, was, at, around, 1, million, arabs, the, ma, qilis, also, entered, the, maghreb, during, this, wave, of, arabian, tribal, immigration, in, the, 11th, century, they, later, allied, with, the, banu, hilal, and, entered, under, their, protection, they, adapted, to, the, climatic, desert, conditions, of, the, maghreb, discovering, the, same, way, of, life, as, in, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, 13th, century, they, occupied, southern, algeria, and, dominated, the, oases, of, tuat, and, gourara, for, some, authors, at, this, point, the, maqil, group, had, already, disintegrated, into, different, populations, in, the, maghreb, and, had, given, rise, to, the, beni, hassan, along, with, other, related, groups, the, beni, hassan, expanded, southwest, and, occupied, sanhaja, lands, in, the, 13th, century, after, invading, and, defeating, the, berber, confederation, the, sanhaja, has, long, had, to, pay, tribute, to, the, nomadic, bedouin, hassani, invaders, this, took, place, during, the, char, bouba, war, in, modern, day, western, sahara, and, mauritania, from, 1644, to, 1674, which, after, decades, of, confrontations, ended, up, completely, arabizing, the, native, berber, population, destroying, their, language, and, culture, and, giving, rise, to, the, contemporary, sahrawi, people, harry, norris, noted, the, moorish, sahara, is, the, western, extremity, of, the, arab, world, western, it, certainly, is, some, districts, further, west, than, ireland, yet, in, its, way, of, life, its, culture, its, literature, and, in, many, of, its, social, customs, it, has, much, in, common, with, the, heart, lands, of, the, arab, east, in, particular, with, the, hijaz, and, najd, and, parts, of, the, yemen, these, bedouin, tribes, emerged, into, several, contemporary, sub, tribes, the, most, well, known, bedouin, tribes, in, algeria, include, awlad, sidi, shaykh, ouled, nail, chaamba, doui, menia, and, hamyan, who, primarily, live, in, the, algerian, desert, the, maghrebi, bedouin, dialects, often, called, hilalian, dialects, are, used, in, the, regions, of, morocco, atlantic, coast, in, regions, of, high, plains, and, sahara, in, algeria, in, regions, of, tunisian, sahel, and, in, regions, of, tripolitania, the, bedouin, dialects, has, four, major, varieties, in, morocco, bedouin, arabic, dialects, are, spoken, in, plains, and, in, recently, founded, cities, such, as, casablanca, thus, the, city, arabic, dialect, shares, with, the, bedouin, dialects, gal, to, say, qala, they, also, represent, the, bulk, of, modern, urban, dialects, koin, s, such, as, those, of, oran, and, algiers, bedouins, in, egypt, mostly, reside, in, the, sinai, peninsula, matruh, red, sea, governate, eastern, parts, of, sharqia, governate, suez, ismailia, and, in, the, suburbs, of, the, egyptian, capital, of, cairo, traditional, bedouin, culture, was, affected, by, the, establishment, of, resort, towns, on, the, red, sea, coast, such, as, sharm, el, sheikh, in, the, wake, of, urbanization, and, educational, opportunities, many, bedouins, now, marry, outside, their, tribe, a, practice, that, once, was, frowned, upon, bedouins, living, in, the, sinai, peninsula, did, not, benefit, much, from, the, construction, boom, due, to, the, low, wages, offered, sudanese, and, egyptian, workers, were, brought, in, as, construction, workers, instead, when, the, tourist, industry, started, to, bloom, local, bedouins, became, cab, drivers, tour, guides, and, managers, of, campgrounds, and, coffee, shops, tarabin, and, other, bedouin, tribes, living, along, the, border, between, egypt, and, israel, have, been, involved, in, inter, border, smuggling, of, drugs, and, weapons, as, well, as, infiltration, of, prostitutes, and, african, labour, workers, in, most, countries, in, the, middle, east, the, bedouin, have, no, land, rights, only, users, privileges, and, it, is, especially, true, for, egypt, since, the, mid, 1980s, the, bedouins, who, held, desirable, coastal, property, have, lost, control, of, much, of, their, land, as, it, was, sold, by, the, egyptian, government, to, hotel, operators, the, egyptian, government, did, not, see, the, land, as, belonging, to, bedouin, tribes, but, rather, as, state, property, in, the, summer, of, 1999, the, egyptian, army, bulldozed, bedouin, run, tourist, campgrounds, north, of, nuweiba, as, part, of, the, final, phase, of, hotel, development, overseen, by, the, tourist, development, agency, tda, the, director, of, the, tourist, development, agency, dismissed, bedouin, rights, to, most, of, the, land, saying, that, they, had, not, lived, on, the, coast, prior, to, 1982, their, traditional, semi, nomadic, culture, has, left, bedouins, vulnerable, to, such, claims, the, egyptian, revolution, of, 2011, brought, more, freedom, to, the, sinai, bedouin, but, since, they, were, involved, in, drug, smuggling, into, gaza, the, egyptian, army, demolished, over, 120, tunnels, that, were, used, as, smuggling, channels, compelling, them, to, cooperate, with, state, troops, and, officials, after, negotiations, the, military, campaign, ended, with, a, new, agreement, between, the, bedouin, and, egyptian, authorities, there, are, a, number, of, bedouin, tribes, but, the, total, population, is, often, difficult, to, determine, especially, as, many, bedouin, have, ceased, to, lead, nomadic, or, semi, nomadic, lifestyles, below, is, a, partial, list, of, bedouin, tribes, and, their, historic, place,
