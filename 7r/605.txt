networks, from, broadcasting, in, the, 7, 8, p, m, time, slot, immediately, preceding, prime, time, opening, up, time, slots, for, syndicated, programming, most, of, the, syndicated, programs, were, nighttime, adaptations, of, network, daytime, game, shows, these, game, shows, originally, aired, once, a, week, but, by, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, most, of, the, games, had, transitioned,

general, interest, networks, such, as, cbn, cable, network, forerunner, to, freeform, and, usa, network, had, popular, blocks, for, game, show, reruns, from, the, mid, 1980s, to, the, mid, 90s, before, that, niche, market, was, overtaken, by, game, show, network, in, 1994, in, the, united, kingdom, game, shows, have, had, a, more, steady, and, permanent, place, in, the, television, lineup, and, never, lost, popularity, in, the, 1990s, as, they, did, in, the, united, states, due, in, part, to, the, fact, that, game, shows, were, highly, regulated, by, the, independent, broadcasting, authority, in, the, 1980s, and, that, those, restrictions, were, lifted, in, the, 1990s, allowing, for, higher, stakes, games, to, be, played, after, the, popularity, of, game, shows, hit, a, nadir,

canceled, one, of, those, exceptions, was, winning, lines, which, continued, to, air, in, the, united, kingdom, until, 2004, even, though, it, was, canceled, in, the, united, states, in, early, 2000, these, higher, stakes, contests, nevertheless, opened, the, door, to, reality, television, contests, such, as, survivor, and, big, brother, in, which, contestants, win, large, sums, of, money, for, outlasting, their, peers, in, a, given, environment, several, game, shows, returned, to, daytime, in, syndication, during, this, time, as, well, such, as, family, feud, hollywood, squares, and,

and, lifted, its, winnings, limit, in, 2003, which, one, year, later, allowed, ken, jennings, to, become, the, show, s, first, multi, million, dollar, winner, it, has, also, increased, the, stakes, of, its, tournaments, and, put, a, larger, focus, on, contestants, with, strong, personalities, the, show, has, since, produced, four, more, millionaires, tournament, winner, brad, rutter, and,

closely, paralleled, around, the, world, reg, grundy, organisation, for, instance, would, buy, the, international, rights, for, american, game, shows, and, reproduce, them, in, other, countries, especially, in, grundy, s, native, australia, dutch, producer, endemol, later, purchased, by, american, companies, disney, and, apollo, global, management, then, resold, to, french, company, banijay,

to, others, game, shows, have, had, an, inconsistent, place, in, television, in, canada, with, most, homegrown, game, shows, there, being, made, for, the, french, speaking, quebec, market, and, the, majority, of, english, language, game, shows, in, the, country, being, rebroadcast, from, or, made, with, the, express, intent, of, export, to, the, united, states, there, have, been, exceptions, to, this, see, for, instance, the, long, running, definition, unlike, reality, television, franchises, international, game, show, franchises, generally, only, see, canadian, adaptations, in, a, series, of, specials, based, heavily, on, the, american, versions, but, usually, with, a, canadian, host, to, allow, for, canadian, content, credits, one, of, those, exceptions, was, le, banquier, a, quebec, french, language, version, of, deal, or, no, deal, which, aired, on, tva, from, 2008, to, 2015, the, smaller, markets, and, lower, revenue, opportunities, for, canadian, shows, in, general, also, affect, game, shows, there, with, canadian, games, especially, quebecois, ones, often, having, very, low, budgets, for, prizes, unless, the, series, is, made, for, export, canadian, contestants, are, generally, allowed, to, participate, on, american, game, shows, and, there, have, been, at, least, three, canadian, game, show, hosts, howie, mandel, monty, hall, and, alex, trebek, who, have, gone, on, to, long, careers, hosting, american, series, while, jim, perry, an, american, host, was, prominent, as, a, host, of, canadian, shows, american, game, shows, have, a, tendency, to, hire, stronger, contestants, than, their, british, or, australian, counterparts, many, of, the, most, successful, game, show, contestants, in, america, would, likely, never, be, cast, in, a, british, or, australian, game, show, for, fear, of, having, them, dominate, the, game, according, to, mark, labbett, who, appeared, in, all, three, countries, on, the, game, show, the, chase, the, japanese, game, show, is, a, distinct, format, borrowing, heavily, from, variety, formats, physical, stunts, and, athletic, competitions, the, japanese, style, has, been, adapted, overseas, and, at, one, point, was, parodied, with, an, american, reality, competition, i, survived, a, japanese, game, show, which, used, a, fake, japanese, game, show, as, its, central, conceit, many, of, the, prizes, awarded, on, game, shows, are, provided, through, product, placement, but, in, some, cases, they, are, provided, by, private, organizations, or, purchased, at, either, the, full, price, or, at, a, discount, by, the, show, there, is, the, widespread, use, of, promotional, consideration, in, which, a, game, show, receives, a, subsidy, from, an, advertiser, in, return, for, awarding, that, manufacturer, s, product, as, a, prize, or, consolation, prize, some, products, supplied, by, manufacturers, may, not, be, intended, to, be, awarded, and, are, instead, just, used, as, part, of, the, gameplay, such, as, the, low, priced, items, used, in, several, the, price, is, right, pricing, games, although, in, this, show, the, smaller, items, sometimes, even, in, the, single, digits, of, dollars, are, awarded, as, well, when, the, price, is, correctly, guessed, even, when, a, contestant, loses, the, major, prize, they, were, playing, for, for, high, stakes, games, a, network, may, purchase, prize, indemnity, insurance, to, avoid, paying, the, cost, of, a, rare, but, expensive, prize, out, of, pocket, if, the, said, prize, is, won, too, often, the, insurance, company, may, refuse, to, insure, a, show, this, was, a, factor, in, the, discontinuation, of, the, price, is, right, 1, 000, 000, spectacular, series, of, prime, time, specials, in, april, 2008, three, of, the, contestants, on, the, price, is, right, 1, 000, 000, spectacular, won, the, top, prize, in, a, five, episode, span, after, fifteen, episodes, without, a, winner, due, in, large, part, to, a, change, in, the, rules, the, insurance, companies, had, made, it, extremely, difficult, to, get, further, insurance, for, the, remaining, episodes, a, network, or, syndicator, may, also, opt, to, distribute, large, cash, prizes, in, the, form, of, an, annuity, spreading, the, cost, of, the, prize, out, over, several, years, or, decades, from, about, 1960, through, the, rest, of, the, 20th, century, american, networks, placed, restrictions, on, the, amount, of, money, that, could, be, given, away, on, a, game, show, in, an, effort, to, avoid, a, repeat, of, the, scandals, of, the, 1950s, this, usually, took, the, form, of, an, earnings, cap, that, forced, a, player, to, retire, once, they, had, won, a, certain, amount, of, money, or, a, limit, on, how, many, episodes, usually, five, on, which, a, player, could, appear, on, a, show, the, introduction, of, syndicated, games, particularly, in, the, 1980s, eventually, allowed, for, more, valuable, prizes, and, extended, runs, on, a, particular, show, british, television, was, under, even, stricter, regulations, on, prizes, until, the, 1990s, seriously, restricting, the, value, of, prizes, that, could, be, given, and, disallowing, games, of, chance, to, have, an, influence, on, the, results, of, the, game, thus, the, british, version, of, the, price, is, right, at, first, did, not, include, the, american, version, s, showcase, showdown, in, which, contestants, spun, a, large, wheel, to, determine, who, would, advance, to, the, showcase, bonus, round, in, canada, prizes, were, limited, not, by, bureaucracy, but, necessity, as, the, much, smaller, population, limited, the, audience, of, shows, marketed, toward, that, country, the, lifting, of, these, restrictions, in, the, 1990s, was, a, major, factor, in, the, explosion, of, high, stakes, game, shows, in, the, later, part, of, that, decade, in, both, the, u, s, and, britain, and, subsequently, around, the, world, a, bonus, round, also, known, as, a, bonus, game, or, an, end, game, usually, follows, a, main, game, as, a, bonus, to, the, winner, of, that, game, in, the, bonus, round, the, stakes, are, higher, and, the, game, is, considered, to, be, tougher, the, game, play, of, a, bonus, round, usually, varies, from, the, standard, game, play, of, the, front, game, and, there, are, often, borrowed, or, related, elements, of, the, main, game, in, the, bonus, round, to, ensure, the, entire, show, has, a, unified, premise, though, some, end, games, are, referred, to, as, bonus, rounds, many, are, not, specifically, referred, to, as, such, in, games, but, fit, the, same, general, role, there, is, no, one, formula, for, the, format, of, a, bonus, round, there, are, differences, in, almost, every, bonus, round, though, there, are, many, recurring, elements, from, show, to, show, the, bonus, round, is, often, played, for, the, show, s, top, prize, it, is, almost, always, played, without, an, opponent, two, notable, exceptions, to, this, are, jeopardy, and, the, current, version, of, the, price, is, right, on, jeopardy, the, final, round, involves, all, remaining, contestants, with, a, positive, score, wagering, strategically, to, win, the, game, and, be, invited, back, the, next, day, jeopardy, attempted, to, replace, this, round, with, a, traditional, solo, bonus, round, in, 1978, but, this, version, was, not, a, success, and, the, round, was, replaced, by, the, original, final, jeopardy, when, the, show, returned, in, 1984, the, price, is, right, uses, a, knockout, tournament, format, in, which, the, six, contestants, to, make, it, onstage, are, narrowed, to, two, in, a, showcase, showdown, these, two, winners, then, move, on, to, the, final, showcase, round, to, determine, the, day, s, winner, until, the, 1960s, most, game, shows, did, not, offer, a, bonus, round, in, traditional, two, player, formats, the, winner, if, a, game, show, s, rules, provided, for, this, became, the, champion, and, simply, played, a, new, challenger, either, on, the, next, show, or, after, the, commercial, break, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, bonus, rounds, was, the, jackpot, round, of, the, original, series, beat, the, clock, after, two, rounds, of, performing, stunts, the, wife, of, the, contestant, couple, would, perform, at, a, jackpot, board, for, a, prize, the, contestant, was, shown, a, famous, quotation, or, common, phrase, and, the, words, were, scrambled, to, win, the, announced, bonus, the, contestant, had, to, unscramble, the, words, within, 20, seconds, the, contestant, received, a, consolation, gift, worth, over, 200, if, she, was, unsuccessful, another, early, bonus, round, ended, each, episode, of, you, bet, your, life, with, the, team, who, won, the, most, money, answering, one, final, question, for, a, jackpot, which, started, at, 1, 000, and, increased, 500, each, week, until, won, another, early, example, was, the, lightning, round, on, the, word, game, password, starting, in, 1961, the, contestant, who, won, the, front, game, played, a, quick, fire, series, of, passwords, within, 60, seconds, netting, 50, per, correctly, guessed, word, for, a, maximum, bonus, prize, of, 250, the, bonus, round, came, about, after, game, show, producer, mark, goodson, was, first, presented, password, contending, that, it, was, not, enough, to, merely, guess, passwords, during, the, show, we, needed, something, more, and, that, s, how, the, lightning, round, was, invited, said, howard, felsher, who, produced, password, and, family, feud, from, that, point, on, every, game, show, had, to, have, an, end, round, you, d, bring, a, show, to, a, network, and, they, d, say, what, s, the, endgame, as, if, they, had, thought, of, it, themselves, the, end, game, of, match, game, hosted, for, most, of, its, run, by, gene, rayburn, served, as, the, impetus, for, a, completely, new, game, show, the, first, part, of, match, game, s, super, match, bonus, round, called, the, audience, match, asked, contestants, to, guess, how, a, studio, audience, responded, to, a, question, in, 1975, with, then, regular, panelist, richard, dawson, becoming, restless, and, progressively, less, cooperative, goodson, decided, that, this, line, of, questioning, would, make, a, good, game, show, of, its, own, and, the, concept, eventually, became, family, feud, as, whose, inaugural, host, dawson, was, hired
