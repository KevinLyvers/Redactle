in, economics, capital, goods, or, capital, are, those, durable, produced, goods, that, are, in, turn, used, as, productive, inputs, for, further, production, of, goods, and, services, a, typical, example, is, the, machinery, used, in, a, factory, at, the, macroeconomic, level, the, nation, s, capital, stock, includes, buildings, equipment, software, and, inventories, during, a, given, year, capital, goods, have, also, been, called, complex, product, systems, cops, the, means, of, production, is, as, a, series, of, heterogeneous, commodities, each, having, specific, technical, characteristics, in, the, form, of, a, durable, good, that, is, used, in, the, production, of, goods, or, services, capital, goods, are, a, particular, form, of, economic, good, and, are, tangible, property, capital, goods, are, one, of, the, three, types, of, producer, goods, the, other, two, being, land, and, labour, the, three, are, also, known, collectively, as, primary, factors, of, production, this, classification, originated, during, the, classical, economics, period, and, has, remained, the, dominant, method, for, classification, capital, can, be, increased, by, the, use, of, the, factors, of, production, which, however, excludes, certain, durable, goods, like, homes, and, personal, automobiles, that, are, not, used, in, the, production, of, saleable, goods, and, services, in, marxian, critique, of, political, economy, capital, is, viewed, as, a, social, relation, critical, analysis, of, the, economists, portrayal, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, as, a, transhistorical, state, of, affairs, distinguishes, different, forms, of, capital, adam, smith, defined, capital, as, that, part, of, man, s, stock, which, he, expects, to, afford, him, revenue, in, economic, models, capital, is, an, input, in, the, production, function, the, total, physical, capital, at, any, given, moment, in, time, is, referred, to, as, the, capital, stock, not, to, be, confused, with, the, capital, stock, of, a, business, entity, capital, goods, real, capital, or, capital, assets, are, already, produced, durable, goods, or, any, non, financial, asset, that, is, used, in, production, of, goods, or, services, classical, and, neoclassical, economics, describe, capital, as, one, of, the, factors, of, production, alongside, the, other, factors, land, and, labour, all, other, inputs, to, production, are, called, intangibles, in, classical, economics, this, includes, organization, entrepreneurship, knowledge, goodwill, or, management, which, some, characterize, as, talent, social, capital, or, instructional, capital, many, definitions, and, descriptions, of, capital, goods, production, have, been, proposed, in, the, literature, capital, goods, are, generally, considered, one, of, a, kind, capital, intensive, products, that, consist, of, many, components, they, are, often, used, as, manufacturing, systems, or, services, themselves, examples, include, hand, tools, machine, tools, data, centers, oil, rigs, semiconductor, fabrication, plants, and, wind, turbines, their, production, is, often, organized, in, projects, with, several, parties, cooperating, in, networks, this, is, what, makes, it, a, factor, of, production, these, distinctions, of, convenience, have, carried, over, to, contemporary, economic, theory, adam, smith, provided, the, further, clarification, that, capital, is, a, stock, as, such, its, value, can, be, estimated, at, a, point, in, time, by, contrast, investment, as, production, to, be, added, to, the, capital, stock, is, described, as, taking, place, over, time, per, year, thus, a, flow, earlier, illustrations, often, described, capital, as, physical, items, such, as, tools, buildings, and, vehicles, that, are, used, in, the, production, process, since, at, least, the, 1960s, economists, have, increasingly, focused, on, broader, forms, of, capital, for, example, investment, in, skills, and, education, can, be, viewed, as, building, up, human, capital, or, knowledge, capital, and, investments, in, intellectual, property, can, be, viewed, as, building, up, intellectual, capital, natural, capital, is, the, world, s, stock, of, natural, resources, which, includes, geology, soils, air, water, and, all, living, organisms, these, terms, lead, to, certain, questions, and, controversies, discussed, in, those, articles, a, capital, good, lifecycle, typically, consists, of, tendering, engineering, and, procurement, manufacturing, commissioning, maintenance, and, sometimes, decommissioning, capital, goods, are, a, major, factor, in, the, process, of, technical, innovation, all, innovations, whether, they, involve, the, introduction, of, a, new, product, or, provide, a, cheaper, way, of, producing, an, existing, product, require, that, the, capital, goods, sector, shall, produce, a, new, product, machine, or, physical, plant, according, to, certain, specifications, capital, goods, are, a, constituent, element, of, the, stock, of, capital, assets, or, fixed, capital, and, play, a, key, role, in, the, economic, analysis, of, growth, and, production, as, well, as, the, distribution, of, income, capital, goods, can, also, be, immaterial, when, they, take, the, form, of, intellectual, property, many, production, processes, require, the, intellectual, property, to, legally, produce, their, products, just, like, material, capital, goods, they, can, require, substantial, investment, and, can, also, be, subject, to, amortization, depreciation, and, divestment, people, buy, capital, goods, to, use, as, static, resources, to, make, other, goods, whereas, consumer, goods, are, purchased, to, be, consumed, for, example, an, automobile, is, a, consumer, good, when, purchased, as, a, private, car, dump, trucks, used, in, manufacturing, or, construction, are, capital, goods, because, companies, use, them, to, build, things, like, roads, dams, buildings, and, bridges, in, the, same, way, a, chocolate, bar, is, a, consumer, good, but, the, machines, that, produce, the, candy, are, capital, goods, some, capital, goods, can, be, used, in, both, production, of, consumer, goods, or, production, goods, such, as, machinery, for, the, production, of, dump, trucks, consumption, is, the, logical, result, of, all, economic, activity, but, the, level, of, future, consumption, depends, on, the, future, capital, stock, and, this, in, turn, depends, on, the, current, level, of, production, in, the, capital, goods, sector, hence, if, there, is, a, desire, to, increase, consumption, the, output, of, the, capital, goods, should, be, maximized, capital, goods, often, called, complex, products, and, systems, cops, play, an, important, role, in, today, s, economy, aside, from, allowing, a, business, to, create, goods, or, provide, services, for, consumers, capital, goods, are, important, in, other, ways, in, an, industry, where, production, equipment, and, materials, are, quite, expensive, they, can, be, a, high, barrier, to, entry, for, new, companies, if, a, new, business, cannot, afford, to, purchase, the, machines, it, needs, to, create, a, product, for, example, it, may, not, be, able, to, compete, as, effectively, in, the, market, such, a, company, might, turn, to, another, business, to, supply, its, products, but, this, can, be, expensive, as, well, this, means, that, in, industries, where, the, means, of, production, represent, a, large, amount, of, a, business, s, start, up, costs, the, number, of, companies, competing, in, the, market, is, often, relatively, small, the, acquisition, of, machinery, and, other, expensive, equipment, often, represents, a, significant, investment, for, a, company, when, a, business, is, struggling, it, often, puts, off, such, purchases, as, long, as, possible, since, it, does, not, make, sense, to, spend, money, on, equipment, if, the, company, is, not, around, to, use, it, capital, spending, can, be, a, sign, that, a, manufacturer, expects, growth, or, at, least, a, steady, demand, for, its, products, a, potentially, positive, economic, sign, in, most, cases, capital, goods, require, a, substantial, investment, on, behalf, of, the, producer, and, their, purchase, is, usually, referred, to, as, a, capital, expense, these, goods, are, important, to, businesses, because, they, use, these, items, to, make, functional, goods, for, customers, or, to, provide, consumers, with, valuable, services, as, a, result, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, producers, goods, production, goods, or, means, of, production, in, the, theory, of, international, trade, the, causes, and, nature, of, the, trade, of, capital, goods, receive, little, attention, trade, in, capital, goods, is, a, crucial, part, of, the, dynamic, relationship, between, international, trade, and, development, the, production, and, trade, of, capital, goods, as, well, as, consumer, goods, must, be, introduced, to, trade, models, and, the, entire, analysis, integrated, with, domestic, capital, accumulation, theory, detailed, classifications, of, capital, that, have, been, used, in, various, theoretical, or, applied, uses, generally, respect, the, following, division, separate, literatures, have, developed, to, describe, both, natural, capital, and, social, capital, such, terms, reflect, a, wide, consensus, that, nature, and, society, both, function, in, such, a, similar, manner, as, traditional, industrial, infrastructural, capital, that, it, is, entirely, appropriate, to, refer, to, them, as, different, types, of, capital, in, themselves, in, particular, they, can, be, used, in, the, production, of, other, goods, are, not, used, up, immediately, in, the, process, of, production, and, can, be, enhanced, if, not, created, by, human, effort, there, is, also, a, literature, of, intellectual, capital, and, intellectual, property, law, however, this, increasingly, distinguishes, means, of, capital, investment, and, collection, of, potential, rewards, for, patent, copyright, creative, or, individual, capital, and, trademark, social, trust, or, social, capital, instruments, building, on, marx, and, on, the, theories, of, the, sociologist, and, philosopher, pierre, bourdieu, scholars, have, recently, argued, for, the, significance, of, culinary, capital, in, the, arena, of, food, the, idea, is, that, the, production, consumption, and, distribution, of, knowledge, about, food, can, confer, power, and, status, within, classical, economics, adam, smith, wealth, of, nations, book, ii, chapter, 1, distinguished, fixed, capital, from, circulating, capital, the, former, designated, physical, assets, not, consumed, in, the, production, of, a, product, e, g, machines, and, storage, facilities, while, the, latter, referred, to, physical, assets, consumed, in, the, process, of, production, e, g, raw, materials, and, intermediate, products, for, an, enterprise, both, were, types, of, capital, economist, henry, george, argued, that, financial, instruments, like, stocks, bonds, mortgages, promissory, notes, or, other, certificates, for, transferring, wealth, is, not, really, capital, because, their, economic, value, merely, represents, the, power, of, one, class, to, appropriate, the, earnings, of, another, and, their, increase, or, decrease, does, not, affect, the, sum, of, wealth, in, the, community, some, thinkers, such, as, werner, sombart, and, max, weber, locate, the, concept, of, capital, as, originating, in, double, entry, bookkeeping, which, is, thus, a, foundational, innovation, in, capitalism, sombart, writing, in, medieval, and, modern, commercial, enterprise, that, karl, marx, adds, a, distinction, that, is, often, confused, with, david, ricardo, s, in, marxian, theory, variable, capital, refers, to, a, capitalist, s, investment, in, labor, power, seen, as, the, only, source, of, surplus, value, it, is, called, variable, since, the, amount, of, value, it, can, produce, varies, from, the, amount, it, consumes, i, e, it, creates, new, value, on, the, other, hand, constant, capital, refers, to, investment, in, non, human, factors, of, production, such, as, plant, and, machinery, which, marx, takes, to, contribute, only, its, own, replacement, value, to, the, commodities, it, is, used, to, produce, investment, or, capital, accumulation, in, classical, economic, theory, is, the, production, of, increased, capital, investment, requires, that, some, goods, be, produced, that, are, not, immediately, consumed, but, instead, used, to, produce, other, goods, as, capital, goods, investment, is, closely, related, to, saving, though, it, is, not, the, same, as, keynes, pointed, out, saving, involves, not, spending, all, of, one, s, income, on, current, goods, or, services, while, investment, refers, to, spending, on, a, specific, type, of, goods, i, e, capital, goods, austrian, school, economist, eugen, boehm, von, bawerk, maintained, that, capital, intensity, was, measured, by, the, roundaboutness, of, production, processes, since, capital, is, defined, by, him, as, being, goods, of, higher, order, or, goods, used, to, produce, consumer, goods, and, derived, their, value, from, them, being, future, goods, human, development, theory, describes, human, capital, as, being, composed, of, distinct, social, imitative, and, creative, elements, this, theory, is, the, basis, of, triple, bottom, line, accounting, and, is, further, developed, in, ecological, economics, welfare, economics, and, the, various, theories, of, green, economics, all, of, which, use, a, particularly, abstract, notion, of, capital, in, which, the, requirement, of, capital, being, produced, like, durable, goods, is, effectively, removed, the, cambridge, capital, controversy, was, a, dispute, between, economists, at, cambridge, massachusetts, based, mit, and, university, of, cambridge, in, the, uk, about, the, measurement, of, capital, the, cambridge, uk, economists, including, joan, robinson, and, piero, sraffa, claimed, that, there, is, no, basis, for, aggregating, the, heterogeneous, objects, that, constitute, capital, goods, political, economists, jonathan, nitzan, and, shimshon, bichler, have, suggested, that, capital, is, not, a, productive, entity, but, solely, financial, and, that, capital, values, measure, the, relative, power, of, owners, over, the, broad, social, processes, that, bear, on, profits
