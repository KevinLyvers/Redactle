would, be, granted, freedom, although, slavery, is, usually, involuntary, and, involves, coercion, there, are, also, cases, where, people, voluntarily, enter, into, slavery, to, pay, a, debt, or, earn, money, due, to, poverty, in, the, course, of, human, history, slavery, was, a, typical, feature, of, civilization, and, was, legal, in, most, societies, but, it, is, now, outlawed, in, most, countries, of, the, world, except, as, a, punishment, for, a, crime, in, chattel, slavery, the, slave, is, legally, rendered, the, personal, property, chattel, of, the, slave, owner, in, economics, the, term, de, facto, slavery, describes, the, conditions, of, unfree, labour, and, forced, labour, that, most, slaves, endure, mauritania, was, the, last, country, in, the, world, to, officially, ban, slavery, in, 1981, with, legal, prosecution, of, slaveholders, established, in, 2007, however, in, 2019, approximately, 40, million, people, of, whom, 26, were, children, were, still, enslaved, throughout, the, world, despite, slavery, being, illegal, in, the, modern, world, more, than, 50, of, slaves, provide, forced, labour, usually, in, the, factories, and, sweatshops, of, the, private, sector, of, a, country, s, economy, in, industrialised, countries, human, trafficking, is, a, modern, variety, of, slavery, in, non, industrialised, countries, debt, bondage, is, a, common, form, of, enslavement, such, as, captive, domestic, servants, people, in, forced, marriages, and, child, soldiers, the, word, slave, was, borrowed, into, middle, english, through, the, old, french, esclave, which, ultimately, derives, from, byzantine, greek, skl, bos, or, sklab, nos, according, to, the, widespread, view, which, has, been, known, since, the, 18th, century, the, byzantine, skl, binoi, sklab, no, borrowed, from, a, slavic, tribe, self, name, slov, ne, turned, into, late, latin, scl, vus, in, the, meaning, prisoner, of, war, slave, slave, in, the, 8th, 9th, century, because, they, often, became, captured, and, enslaved, however, this, version, has, been, disputed, since, the, 19th, century, an, alternative, contemporary, hypothesis, states, that, medieval, latin, scl, vus, via, scyl, vus, derives, from, byzantine, sk, l, skyl, or, sk, le, skyle, with, the, meaning, to, strip, the, enemy, killed, in, a, battle, or, to, make, booty, extract, spoils, of, war, this, version, has, been, criticized, as, well, there, is, a, dispute, among, historians, about, whether, terms, such, as, unfree, labourer, or, enslaved, person, rather, than, slave, should, be, used, when, describing, the, victims, of, slavery, according, to, those, proposing, a, change, in, terminology, slave, perpetuates, the, crime, of, slavery, in, language, by, reducing, its, victims, to, a, nonhuman, noun, instead, of, carry, them, forward, as, people, not, the, property, that, they, were, see, also, people, first, language, other, historians, prefer, slave, because, the, term, is, familiar, and, shorter, or, because, it, accurately, reflects, the, inhumanity, of, slavery, with, person, implying, a, degree, of, autonomy, that, slavery, does, not, allow, as, a, social, institution, chattel, slavery, classes, slaves, as, chattels, personal, property, owned, by, the, enslaver, like, livestock, they, can, be, bought, and, sold, at, will, chattel, slavery, was, historically, the, normal, form, of, slavery, and, was, practiced, in, places, such, as, the, roman, empire, and, classical, greece, where, it, was, considered, a, keystone, of, society, other, places, where, it, was, extensively, practiced, include, medieval, egypt, subsaharan, africa, brazil, the, united, states, and, parts, of, the, caribbean, such, as, cuba, and, haiti, the, iroquois, enslaved, others, in, ways, that, looked, very, like, chattel, slavery, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, a, series, of, abolitionist, movements, saw, slavery, as, a, violation, of, the, slaves, rights, as, people, all, men, are, created, equal, and, sought, to, abolish, it, abolitionism, encountered, extreme, resistance, but, was, eventually, successful, several, of, the, states, of, the, united, states, began, abolishing, slavery, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, the, french, revolution, tried, to, abolish, slavery, in, 1794, but, a, permanent, abolition, did, not, occur, until, 1848, in, the, much, of, the, british, empire, slavery, was, subject, to, abolition, in, 1833, throughout, the, united, states, it, was, abolished, in, 1865, and, in, cuba, in, 1886, the, last, country, in, the, americas, to, abolish, slavery, was, brazil, in, 1888, chattel, slavery, survived, longest, in, the, middle, east, after, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, had, been, suppressed, the, ancient, trans, saharan, slave, trade, the, indian, ocean, slave, trade, and, the, red, sea, slave, trade, continued, to, traffic, slaves, from, the, african, continent, to, the, middle, east, during, the, 20th, century, the, issue, of, chattel, slavery, was, addressed, and, investigated, globally, by, international, bodies, created, by, the, league, of, nations, and, the, united, nations, such, as, the, temporary, slavery, commission, in, 1924, 1926, the, committee, of, experts, on, slavery, in, 1932, and, the, advisory, committee, of, experts, on, slavery, in, 1934, 1939, by, the, time, of, the, un, ad, hoc, committee, on, slavery, in, 1950, 1951, legal, chattel, slavery, still, existed, only, in, the, arabian, peninsula, in, oman, in, qatar, in, saudi, arabia, in, the, trucial, states, and, in, yemen, legal, chattel, slavery, was, finally, abolished, in, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, 1960s, saudi, arabia, and, yemen, in, 1962, in, dubai, in, 1963, and, oman, as, the, last, in, 1970, the, last, country, to, abolish, slavery, mauritania, did, so, in, 1981, the, 1981, ban, on, slavery, was, not, enforced, in, practice, as, there, were, no, legal, mechanisms, to, prosecute, those, who, used, slaves, these, only, came, in, 2007, indenture, also, known, as, bonded, labour, or, debt, bondage, is, a, form, of, unfree, labour, in, which, a, person, works, to, pay, off, a, debt, by, pledging, himself, or, herself, as, collateral, the, services, required, to, repay, the, debt, and, their, duration, may, be, undefined, debt, bondage, can, be, passed, on, from, generation, to, generation, with, children, required, to, pay, off, their, progenitors, debt, it, is, the, most, widespread, form, of, slavery, today, debt, bondage, is, most, prevalent, in, south, asia, money, marriage, refers, to, a, marriage, where, a, girl, usually, is, married, off, to, a, man, to, settle, debts, owed, by, her, parents, the, chukri, system, is, a, debt, bondage, system, found, in, parts, of, bengal, where, a, female, can, be, coerced, into, prostitution, in, order, to, pay, off, debts, the, word, slavery, has, also, been, used, to, refer, to, a, legal, state, of, dependency, to, somebody, else, for, example, in, persia, the, situations, and, lives, of, such, slaves, could, be, better, than, those, of, common, citizens, forced, labour, or, unfree, labour, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, an, individual, who, is, forced, to, work, against, their, own, will, under, threat, of, violence, or, other, punishment, this, may, also, include, institutions, not, commonly, classified, as, slavery, such, as, serfdom, conscription, and, penal, labour, as, slavery, has, been, legally, outlawed, in, all, countries, forced, labour, in, the, present, day, frequently, referred, to, as, modern, slavery, revolves, around, illegal, control, human, trafficking, primarily, involves, women, and, children, forced, into, prostitution, and, is, the, fastest, growing, form, of, forced, labour, with, thailand, cambodia, india, brazil, and, mexico, having, been, identified, as, leading, hotspots, of, commercial, sexual, exploitation, of, children, in, 2007, human, rights, watch, estimated, that, 200, 000, to, 300, 000, children, served, as, soldiers, in, then, current, conflicts, more, girls, under, 16, work, as, domestic, workers, than, any, other, category, of, child, labour, often, sent, to, cities, by, parents, living, in, rural, poverty, as, with, the, haitian, restaveks, forced, marriages, or, early, marriages, are, often, considered, types, of, slavery, forced, marriage, continues, to, be, practiced, in, parts, of, the, world, including, some, parts, of, asia, and, africa, and, in, immigrant, communities, in, the, west, marriage, by, abduction, occurs, in, many, places, in, the, world, today, with, a, 2003, study, finding, a, national, average, of, 69, of, marriages, in, ethiopia, being, through, abduction, the, word, slavery, is, often, used, as, a, pejorative, to, describe, any, activity, in, which, one, is, coerced, into, performing, some, argue, that, military, drafts, and, other, forms, of, coerced, government, labour, constitute, state, operated, slavery, some, libertarians, and, anarcho, capitalists, view, government, taxation, as, a, form, of, slavery, slavery, has, been, used, by, some, anti, psychiatry, proponents, to, define, involuntary, psychiatric, patients, claiming, there, are, no, unbiased, physical, tests, for, mental, illness, and, yet, the, psychiatric, patient, must, follow, the, orders, of, the, psychiatrist, they, assert, that, instead, of, chains, to, control, the, slave, the, psychiatrist, uses, drugs, to, control, the, mind, drapetomania, was, a, pseudoscientific, psychiatric, diagnosis, for, a, slave, who, desired, freedom, symptoms, included, laziness, and, the, tendency, to, flee, captivity, some, proponents, of, animal, rights, have, applied, the, term, slavery, to, the, condition, of, some, or, all, human, owned, animals, arguing, that, their, status, is, comparable, to, that, of, human, slaves, the, labour, market, as, institutionalized, under, contemporary, capitalist, systems, has, been, criticized, by, mainstream, socialists, and, by, anarcho, syndicalists, who, utilise, the, term, wage, slavery, as, a, pejorative, or, dysphemism, for, wage, labour, socialists, draw, parallels, between, the, trade, of, labour, as, a, commodity, and, slavery, cicero, is, also, known, to, have, suggested, such, parallels, economists, have, modeled, the, circumstances, under, which, slavery, and, variants, such, as, serfdom, appear, and, disappear, one, theoretical, model, is, that, slavery, becomes, more, desirable, for, landowners, where, land, is, abundant, but, labour, is, scarce, such, that, rent, is, depressed, and, paid, workers, can, demand, high, wages, if, the, opposite, holds, true, then, it, is, more, costly, for, landowners, to, guard, the, slaves, than, to, employ, paid, workers, who, can, demand, only, low, wages, because, of, the, degree, of, competition, thus, first, slavery, and, then, serfdom, gradually, decreased, in, europe, as, the, population, grew, they, were, reintroduced, in, the, americas, and, in, russia, as, large, areas, of, land, with, few, inhabitants, became, available, slavery, is, more, common, when, the, tasks, are, relatively, simple, and, thus, easy, to, supervise, such, as, large, scale, monocrops, such, as, sugarcane, and, cotton, in, which, output, depended, on, economies, of, scale, this, enables, systems, of, labour, such, as, the, gang, system, in, the, united, states, to, become, prominent, on, large, plantations, where, field, hands, toiled, with, factory, like, precision, then, each, work, gang, was, based, on, an, internal, division, of, labour, that, assigned, every, member, of, the, gang, to, a, task, and, made, each, worker, s, performance, dependent, on, the, actions, of, the, others, the, slaves, chopped, out, the, weeds, that, surrounded, the, cotton, plants, as, well, as, excess, sprouts, plow, gangs, followed, behind, stirring, the, soil, near, the, plants, and, tossing, it, back, around, the, plants, thus, the, gang, system, worked, like, an, assembly, line, since, the, 18th, century, critics, have, argued, that, slavery, hinders, technological, advancement, because, the, focus, is, on, increasing, the, number, of, slaves, doing, simple, tasks, rather, than, upgrading, their, efficiency, for, example, it, is, sometimes, argued, that, because, of, this, narrow, focus, technology, in, greece, and, later, in, rome, was, not, applied, to, ease, physical, labour, or, improve, manufacturing, scottish, economist, adam, smith, stated, that, free, labour, was, economically, better, than, slave, labour, and, that, it, was, nearly, impossible, to, end, slavery, in, a, free, democratic, or, republican, form, of, government, since, many, of, its, legislators, or, political, figures, were, slave, owners, and, would, not, punish, themselves, he, further, stated, that, slaves, would, be, better, able, to, gain, their, freedom, under, centralized, government, or, a, central, authority, like, a, king, or, church, similar, arguments, appeared, later, in, the, works, of, auguste, comte, especially, given, smith, s, belief, in, the, separation, of, powers, or, what, comte, called, the, separation, of, the, spiritual, and, the, temporal, during, the, middle, ages, and, the, end, of, slavery, and, smith, s, criticism, of, masters, past, and, present, as, smith, stated, in, the, lectures, on, jurisprudence, the, great, power, of, the, clergy, thus, concurring, with, that, of, the, king, set, the, slaves, at, liberty, but, it, was, absolutely, necessary, both, that, the, authority, of, the, king, and, of, the, clergy, should, be, great, where, ever, any, one, of, these, was, wanting, slavery, still, continues, even, after, slavery, became, a, criminal, offense, slave, owners, could, get, high, returns, according, to, researcher, siddharth, kara, the, profits, generated, worldwide, by, all, forms, of, slavery, in, 2007, were, 91, 2, billion, that, was, second, only, to, drug, trafficking, in, terms, of, global, criminal, enterprises, at, the, time, the, weighted, average, global, sales, price, of, a, slave, was, estimated, to, be, approximately, 340, with, a, high, of, 1, 895, for, the, average, trafficked, sex, slave, and, a, low, of, 40, to, 50, for, debt, bondage, slaves, in, part, of, asia, and, africa, the, weighted, average, annual, profits, generated, by, a, slave, in, 2007, was, 3, 175, with, a, low, of, an, average, 950, for, bonded, labour, and, 29, 210, for, a, trafficked, sex, slave, approximately, 40, of, slave, profits, each, year, were, generated, by, trafficked, sex, slaves, representing, slightly, more, than, 4, of, the, world, s, 29, million, slaves, a, widespread, practice, was, branding, either, to, explicitly, mark, slaves, as, property, or, as, punishment, slaves, have, been, owned, privately, by, individuals, but, have, also, been, under, state, ownership, for, example, the, kisaeng, were, women, from, low, castes, in, pre, modern, korea, who, were, owned, by, the, state, under, government, officials, known, as, hojang, and, were, required, to, provide, entertainment, to, the, aristocracy, in, the, 2020s, in, north, korea, kippumjo, pleasure, brigades, are, made, up, of, women, selected, from, the, general, population, to, serve, as, entertainers, and, as, concubines, to, the, rulers, of, north, korea, tribute, labor, is, compulsory, labor, for, the, state, and, has, been, used, in, various, iterations, such, as, corv, e, mit, a, and, repartimiento, the, internment, camps, of, totalitarian, regimes, such, as, the, nazis, and, the, soviet, union, placed, increasing, importance, on, the, labor, provided, in, those, camps, leading, to, a, growing, tendency, among, historians, to, designate, such, systems, as, slavery, a, combination, of, these, include, the, encomienda, where, the, spanish, crown, granted, private, individuals, the, right, to, the, free, labour, of, a, specified, number, of, natives, in, a, given, area, in, the, red, rubber, system, of, both, the, congo, free, state, and, french, ruled, ubangi, shari, labour, was, demanded, as, taxation, private, companies, were, conceded, areas, within, which, they, were, allowed, to, use, any, measures, to, increase, rubber, production, convict, leasing, was, common, in, the, southern, united, states, where, the, state, would, lease, prisoners, for, their, free, labour, to, companies, depending, upon, the, era, and, the, country, slaves, sometimes, had, a, limited, set, of, legal, rights, for, example, in, the, province, of, new, york, people, who, deliberately, killed, slaves, were, punishable, under, a, 1686, statute, and, as, already, mentioned, certain, legal, rights, attached, to, the, nobi, in, korea, to, slaves, in, various, african, societies, and, to, black, female, slaves, in, the, french, colony, of, louisiana, giving, slaves, legal, rights, has, sometimes, been, a, matter, of, morality, but, also, sometimes, a, matter, of, self, interest, for, example, in, ancient, athens, protecting, slaves, from, mistreatment, simultaneously, protected, people, who, might, be, mistaken, for, slaves, and, giving, slaves, limited, property, rights, incentivized, slaves, to, work, harder, to, get, more, property, in, the, southern, united, states, prior, to, the, extirpation, of, slavery, in, 1865, a, proslavery, legal, treatise, reported, that, slaves, accused, of, crimes, typically, had, a, legal, right, to, counsel, freedom, from, double, jeopardy, a, right, to, trial, by, jury, in, graver, cases, and, the, right, to, grand, jury, indictment, but, they, lacked, many, other, rights, such, as, white, adults, ability, to, control, their, own, lives, slavery, predates, written, records, and, has, existed, in, many, cultures, slavery, is, rare, among, hunter, gatherer, populations, because, it, requires, economic, surpluses, and, a, substantial, population, density, thus, although, it, has, existed, among, unusually, resource, rich, hunter, gatherers, such, as, the, american, indian, peoples, of, the, salmon, rich, rivers, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, slavery, became, widespread, only, with, the, invention, of, agriculture, during, the, neolithic, revolution, about, 11, 000, years, ago, slavery, was, practiced, in, almost, every, ancient, civilization, such, institutions, included, debt, bondage, punishment, for, crime, the, enslavement, of, prisoners, of, war, child, abandonment, and, the, enslavement, of, slaves, offspring, slavery, was, widespread, in, africa, which, pursued, both, internal, and, external, slave, trade, in, the, senegambia, region, between, 1300, and, 1900, close, to, one, third, of, the, population, was, enslaved, in, early, islamic, states, of, the, western, sahel, including, ghana, mali, segou, and, songhai, about, a, third, of, the, population, were, enslaved, in, european, courtly, society, and, european, aristocracy, black, african, slaves, and, their, children, became, visible, in, the, late, 1300s, and, 1400s, starting, with, frederick, ii, holy, roman, emperor, black, africans, were, included, in, the, retinue, in, 1402, an, ethiopian, embassy, reached, venice, in, the, 1470s, black, africans, were, painted, as, court, attendants, in, wall, paintings, that, were, displayed, in, mantua, and, ferrara, in, the, 1490s, black, africans, were, included, on, the, emblem, of, the, duke, of, milan, during, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, slaves, from, west, africa, were, transported, across, the, sahara, desert, to, north, africa, to, be, sold, to, mediterranean, and, middle, eastern, civilizations, during, the, red, sea, slave, trade, slaves, were, transported, from, africa, across, the, red, sea, to, the, arabian, peninsula, the, indian, ocean, slave, trade, sometimes, known, as, the, east, african, slave, trade, was, multi, directional, africans, were, sent, as, slaves, to, the, arabian, peninsula, to, indian, ocean, islands, including, madagascar, to, the, indian, subcontinent, and, later, to, the, americas, these, traders, captured, bantu, peoples, zanj, from, the, interior, in, present, day, kenya, mozambique, and, tanzania, and, brought, them, to, the, coast, there, the, slaves, gradually, assimilated, in, rural, areas, particularly, on, unguja, and, pemba, islands, some, historians, assert, that, as, many, as, 17, million, people, were, sold, into, slavery, on, the, coast, of, the, indian, ocean, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, and, approximately, 5, million, african, slaves, were, bought, by, muslim, slave, traders, and, taken, from, africa, across, the, red, sea, indian, ocean, and, sahara, desert, between, 1500, and, 1900, the, captives, were, sold, throughout, the, middle, east, this, trade, accelerated, as, superior, ships, led, to, more, trade, and, greater, demand, for, labour, on, plantations, in, the, region, eventually, tens, of, thousands, of, captives, were, being, taken, every, year, the, indian, ocean, slave, trade, was, multi, directional, and, changed, over, time, to, meet, the, demand, for, menial, labour, bantu, slaves, bought, by, east, african, slave, traders, from, southeastern, africa, were, sold, in, cumulatively, large, numbers, over, the, centuries, to, customers, in, egypt, arabia, the, persian, gulf, india, european, colonies, in, the, far, east, the, indian, ocean, islands, ethiopia, and, somalia, according, to, the, encyclopedia, of, african, history, it, is, estimated, that, by, the, 1890s, the, largest, slave, population, of, the, world, about, 2, million, people, was, concentrated, in, the, territories, of, the, sokoto, caliphate, the, use, of, slave, labour, was, extensive, especially, in, agriculture, the, anti, slavery, society, estimated, there, were, 2, million, slaves, in, ethiopia, in, the, early, 1930s, out, of, an, estimated, population, of, 8, to, 16, million, slave, labour, in, east, africa, was, drawn, from, the, zanj, bantu, peoples, that, lived, along, the, east, african, coast, the, zanj, were, for, centuries, shipped, as, slaves, by, arab, traders, to, all, the, countries, bordering, the, indian, ocean, during, the, indian, ocean, slave, trade, the, umayyad, and, abbasid, caliphs, recruited, many, zanj, slaves, as, soldiers, and, as, early, as, 696, there, were, slave, revolts, of, the, zanj, against, their, arab, enslavers, during, their, slavery, in, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, iraq, the, zanj, rebellion, a, series, of, uprisings, that, took, place, between, 869, and, 883, near, basra, also, known, as, basara, against, the, slavery, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, situated, in, present, day, iraq, is, believed, to, have, involved, enslaved, zanj, that, had, originally, been, captured, from, the, african, great, lakes, region, and, areas, further, south, in, east, africa, it, grew, to, involve, over, 500, 000, slaves, and, free, men, who, were, imported, from, across, the, muslim, empire, and, claimed, over, tens, of, thousands, of, lives, in, lower, iraq, the, zanj, who, were, taken, as, slaves, to, the, middle, east, were, often, used, in, strenuous, agricultural, work, as, the, plantation, economy, boomed, and, the, arabs, became, richer, agriculture, and, other, manual, labour, work, was, thought, to, be, demeaning, the, resulting, labour, shortage, led, to, an, increased, slave, market, in, algiers, the, capital, of, algeria, captured, christians, and, europeans, were, forced, into, slavery, in, about, 1650, there, were, as, many, as, 35, 000, christian, slaves, in, algiers, by, one, estimate, raids, by, barbary, slave, traders, on, coastal, villages, and, ships, extending, from, italy, to, iceland, enslaved, an, estimated, 1, to, 1, 25, million, europeans, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, however, this, estimate, is, the, result, of, an, extrapolation, which, assumes, that, the, number, of, european, slaves, captured, by, barbary, pirates, was, constant, for, a, 250, year, period, there, are, no, records, of, how, many, men, women, and, children, were, enslaved, but, it, is, possible, to, calculate, roughly, the, number, of, fresh, captives, that, would, have, been, needed, to, keep, populations, steady, and, replace, those, slaves, who, died, escaped, were, ransomed, or, converted, to, islam, on, this, basis, it, is, thought, that, around, 8, 500, new, slaves, were, needed, annually, to, replenish, numbers, about, 850, 000, captives, over, the, century, from, 1580, to, 1680, by, extension, for, the, 250, years, between, 1530, and, 1780, the, figure, could, easily, have, been, as, high, as, 1, 250, 000, davis, numbers, have, been, refuted, by, other, historians, such, as, david, earle, who, cautions, that, true, picture, of, europeans, slaves, is, clouded, by, the, fact, the, corsairs, also, seized, non, christian, whites, from, eastern, europe, in, addition, the, number, of, slaves, traded, was, hyperactive, with, exaggerated, estimates, relying, on, peak, years, to, calculate, averages, for, entire, centuries, or, millennia, hence, there, were, wide, fluctuations, year, to, year, particularly, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, given, slave, imports, and, also, given, the, fact, that, prior, to, the, 1840s, there, are, no, consistent, records, middle, east, expert, john, wright, cautions, that, modern, estimates, are, based, on, back, calculations, from, human, observation, such, observations, across, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, century, observers, account, for, around, 35, 000, european, christian, slaves, held, throughout, this, period, on, the, barbary, coast, across, tripoli, tunis, but, mostly, in, algiers, the, majority, were, sailors, particularly, those, who, were, english, taken, with, their, ships, but, others, were, fishermen, and, coastal, villagers, however, most, of, these, captives, were, people, from, lands, close, to, africa, particularly, spain, and, italy, this, eventually, led, to, the, bombardment, of, algiers, by, an, anglo, dutch, fleet, in, 1816, under, omani, arabs, zanzibar, became, east, africa, s, main, slave, port, with, as, many, as, 50, 000, african, slaves, passing, through, every, year, during, the, 19th, century, some, historians, estimate, that, between, 11, and, 18, million, african, slaves, crossed, the, red, sea, indian, ocean, and, sahara, desert, from, 650, to, 1900, ad, eduard, r, ppell, described, the, losses, of, sudanese, slaves, being, transported, on, foot, to, egypt, after, the, daftardar, bey, s, 1822, campaign, in, the, southern, nuba, mountains, nearly, 40, 000, slaves, were, captured, however, through, bad, treatment, disease, and, desert, travel, barely, 5, 000, made, it, to, egypt, w, a, veenhoven, wrote, the, german, doctor, gustav, nachtigal, an, eye, witness, believed, that, for, every, slave, who, arrived, at, a, market, three, or, four, died, on, the, way, keltie, the, partition, of, africa, london, 1920, believes, that, for, every, slave, the, arabs, brought, to, the, coast, at, least, six, died, on, the, way, or, during, the, slavers, raid, livingstone, puts, the, figure, as, high, as, ten, to, one, systems, of, servitude, and, slavery, were, common, in, parts, of, africa, as, they, were, in, much, of, the, ancient, world, in, many, african, societies, where, slavery, was, prevalent, the, slaves, were, not, treated, as, chattel, slaves, and, were, given, certain, rights, in, a, system, similar, to, indentured, servitude, elsewhere, in, the, world, the, forms, of, slavery, in, africa, were, closely, related, to, kinship, structures, in, many, african, communities, where, land, could, not, be, owned, enslavement, of, individuals, was, used, as, a, means, to, increase, the, influence, a, person, had, and, expand, connections, this, made, slaves, a, permanent, part, of, a, master, s, lineage, and, the, children, of, slaves, could, become, closely, connected, with, the, larger, family, ties, children, of, slaves, born, into, families, could, be, integrated, into, the, master, s, kinship, group, and, rise, to, prominent, positions, within, society, even, to, the, level, of, chief, in, some, instances, however, stigma, often, remained, attached, and, there, could, be, strict, separations, between, slave, members, of, a, kinship, group, and, those, related, to, the, master, slavery, was, practiced, in, many, different, forms, debt, slavery, enslavement, of, war, captives, military, slavery, and, criminal, slavery, were, all, practiced, in, various, parts, of, africa, slavery, for, domestic, and, court, purposes, was, widespread, throughout, africa, when, the, atlantic, slave, trade, began, many, of, the, local, slave, systems, began, supplying, captives, for, chattel, slave, markets, outside, africa, although, the, atlantic, slave, trade, was, not, the, only, slave, trade, from, africa, it, was, the, largest, in, volume, and, intensity, as, elikia, m, bokolo, wrote, in, le, monde, diplomatique, the, african, continent, was, bled, of, its, human, resources, via, all, possible, routes, across, the, sahara, through, the, red, sea, from, the, indian, ocean, ports, and, across, the, atlantic, at, least, ten, centuries, of, slavery, for, the, benefit, of, the, muslim, countries, from, the, ninth, to, the, nineteenth, four, million, enslaved, people, exported, via, the, red, sea, another, four, million, through, the, swahili, ports, of, the, indian, ocean, perhaps, as, many, as, nine, million, along, the, trans, saharan, caravan, route, and, eleven, to, twenty, million, depending, on, the, author, across, the, atlantic, ocean, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, peaked, in, the, late, 18th, century, when, the, largest, number, of, slaves, were, captured, on, raiding, expeditions, into, the, interior, of, west, africa, these, expeditions, were, typically, carried, out, by, african, kingdoms, such, as, the, oyo, empire, yoruba, the, ashanti, empire, the, kingdom, of, dahomey, and, the, aro, confederacy, it, is, estimated, that, about, 15, percent, of, slaves, died, during, the, voyage, with, mortality, rates, considerably, higher, in, africa, itself, in, the, process, of, capturing, and, transporting, indigenous, peoples, to, the, ships, slavery, in, mexico, can, be, traced, back, to, the, aztecs, other, amerindians, such, as, the, inca, of, the, andes, the, tupinamb, of, brazil, the, creek, of, georgia, and, the, comanche, of, texas, also, practiced, slavery, slavery, in, canada, was, practiced, by, first, nations, and, by, european, settlers, slave, owning, people, of, what, became, canada, were, for, example, the, fishing, societies, such, as, the, yurok, that, lived, along, the, pacific, coast, from, alaska, to, california, on, what, is, sometimes, described, as, the, pacific, or, northern, northwest, coast, some, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, such, as, the, haida, and, tlingit, were, traditionally, known, as, fierce, warriors, and, slave, traders, raiding, as, far, as, california, slavery, was, hereditary, the, slaves, being, prisoners, of, war, and, their, descendants, were, slaves, some, nations, in, british, columbia, continued, to, segregate, and, ostracize, the, descendants, of, slaves, as, late, as, the, 1970s, slavery, in, america, remains, a, contentious, issue, and, played, a, major, role, in, the, history, and, evolution, of, some, countries, triggering, a, revolution, a, civil, war, and, numerous, rebellions, the, countries, that, controlled, most, of, the, transatlantic, slave, market, in, terms, of, number, of, slaves, shipped, were, the, uk, portugal, and, france, in, order, to, establish, itself, as, an, american, empire, spain, had, to, fight, against, the, relatively, powerful, civilizations, of, the, new, world, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, indigenous, peoples, in, the, americas, included, using, the, natives, as, forced, labour, the, spanish, colonies, were, the, first, europeans, to, use, african, slaves, in, the, new, world, on, islands, such, as, cuba, and, hispaniola, it, was, argued, by, some, contemporary, writers, to, be, intrinsically, immoral, bartolom, de, las, casas, a, 16th, century, dominican, friar, and, spanish, historian, participated, in, campaigns, in, cuba, at, bayamo, and, camag, ey, and, was, present, at, the, massacre, of, hatuey, his, observation, of, that, massacre, led, him, to, fight, for, a, social, movement, away, from, the, use, of, natives, as, slaves, also, the, alarming, decline, in, the, native, population, had, spurred, the, first, royal, laws, protecting, the, native, population, the, first, african, slaves, arrived, in, hispaniola, in, 1501, this, era, saw, a, growth, in, race, based, slavery, england, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, the, slave, triangle, was, pioneered, by, francis, drake, and, his, associates, though, english, slave, trading, would, not, take, off, until, the, mid, 17th, century, many, whites, who, arrived, in, north, america, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, came, under, contract, as, indentured, servants, the, transformation, from, indentured, servitude, to, slavery, was, a, gradual, process, in, virginia, the, earliest, legal, documentation, of, such, a, shift, was, in, 1640, where, a, black, man, john, punch, was, sentenced, to, lifetime, slavery, forcing, him, to, serve, his, master, hugh, gwyn, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, for, attempting, to, run, away, this, case, was, significant, because, it, established, the, disparity, between, his, sentence, as, a, black, man, and, that, of, the, two, white, indentured, servants, who, escaped, with, him, one, described, as, dutch, and, one, as, a, scotchman, it, is, the, first, documented, case, of, a, black, man, sentenced, to, lifetime, servitude, and, is, considered, one, of, the, first, legal, cases, to, make, a, racial, distinction, between, black, and, white, indentured, servants, after, 1640, planters, started, to, ignore, the, expiration, of, indentured, contracts, and, keep, their, servants, as, slaves, for, life, this, was, demonstrated, by, the, 1655, case, johnson, v, parker, where, the, court, ruled, that, a, black, man, anthony, johnson, of, virginia, was, granted, ownership, of, another, black, man, john, casor, as, the, result, of, a, civil, case, this, was, the, first, instance, of, a, judicial, determination, in, the, thirteen, colonies, holding, that, a, person, who, had, committed, no, crime, could, be, held, in, servitude, for, life, in, 1519, hern, n, cort, s, brought, the, first, modern, slave, to, the, area, in, the, mid, 16th, century, the, spanish, new, laws, prohibited, slavery, of, the, indigenous, people, including, the, aztecs, a, labour, shortage, resulted, this, led, to, the, african, slaves, being, imported, as, they, were, not, susceptible, to, smallpox, in, exchange, many, africans, were, afforded, the, opportunity, to, buy, their, freedom, while, eventually, others, were, granted, their, freedom, by, their, masters, in, jamaica, the, spanish, enslaved, many, of, the, taino, some, escaped, but, most, died, from, european, diseases, and, overwork, the, spaniards, also, introduced, the, first, african, slaves, spain, practically, did, not, trade, in, slaves, until, 1810, after, the, rebellions, and, independence, of, its, american, territories, or, viceroyalties, after, the, napoleonic, invasions, spain, had, lost, its, industry, and, its, american, territories, except, in, cuba, and, puerto, rico, where, the, african, slave, trade, to, cuba, began, on, a, massive, scale, from, 1810, onwards, it, was, started, by, french, planters, exiled, from, the, french, lost, colony, saint, domingue, haiti, who, settled, in, the, eastern, part, of, cuba, in, 1789, the, spanish, crown, led, an, effort, to, reform, slavery, as, the, demand, for, slave, labour, in, cuba, was, growing, the, crown, issued, a, decree, c, digo, negro, espa, ol, spanish, black, code, that, specified, food, and, clothing, provisions, put, limits, on, the, number, of, work, hours, limited, punishments, required, religious, instruction, and, protected, marriages, forbidding, the, sale, of, young, children, away, from, their, mothers, the, british, made, other, changes, to, the, institution, of, slavery, in, cuba, however, planters, often, flouted, the, laws, and, protested, against, them, considering, them, a, threat, to, their, authority, and, an, intrusion, into, their, personal, lives, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, majority, of, the, labour, in, barbados, was, provided, by, european, indentured, servants, mainly, english, irish, and, scottish, with, african, and, native, american, slaves, providing, little, of, the, workforce, the, introduction, of, sugar, cane, in, 1640, completely, transformed, society, and, the, economy, barbados, eventually, had, one, of, the, world, s, largest, sugar, industries, the, workable, sugar, plantation, required, a, large, investment, and, a, great, deal, of, heavy, labour, at, first, dutch, traders, supplied, the, equipment, financing, and, african, slaves, in, addition, to, transporting, most, of, the, sugar, to, europe, in, 1644, the, population, of, barbados, was, estimated, at, 30, 000, of, which, about, 800, were, of, african, descent, with, the, remainder, mainly, of, english, descent, by, 1700, there, were, 15, 000, free, whites, and, 50, 000, enslaved, africans, in, jamaica, although, the, african, slave, population, in, the, 1670s, and, 1680s, never, exceeded, 10, 000, by, 1800, it, had, increased, to, over, 300, 000, the, increased, implementation, of, slave, codes, or, black, codes, which, created, differential, treatment, between, africans, and, the, white, workers, and, ruling, planter, class, in, response, to, these, codes, several, slave, rebellions, were, attempted, or, planned, during, this, time, but, none, succeeded, the, planters, of, the, dutch, colony, of, suriname, relied, heavily, on, african, slaves, to, cultivate, harvest, and, process, the, commodity, crops, of, coffee, cocoa, sugar, cane, and, cotton, plantations, the, netherlands, abolished, slavery, in, suriname, in, 1863, many, slaves, escaped, the, plantations, with, the, help, of, the, native, south, americans, living, in, the, adjoining, rain, forests, these, runaway, slaves, established, a, new, and, unique, culture, in, the, interior, that, was, highly, successful, in, its, own, right, they, were, known, collectively, in, english, as, maroons, in, french, as, n, g, marrons, literally, meaning, brown, negroes, that, is, pale, skinned, negroes, and, in, dutch, as, marrons, the, maroons, gradually, developed, several, independent, tribes, through, a, process, of, ethnogenesis, as, they, were, made, up, of, slaves, from, different, african, ethnicities, these, tribes, include, the, saramaka, paramaka, ndyuka, or, aukan, kwinti, aluku, or, boni, and, matawai, the, maroons, often, raided, plantations, to, recruit, new, members, from, the, slaves, and, capture, women, as, well, as, to, acquire, weapons, food, and, supplies, they, sometimes, killed, planters, and, their, families, in, the, raids, the, colonists, also, mounted, armed, campaigns, against, the, maroons, who, generally, escaped, through, the, rain, forest, which, they, knew, much, better, than, did, the, colonists, to, end, hostilities, in, the, 18th, century, the, european, colonial, authorities, signed, several, peace, treaties, with, different, tribes, they, granted, the, maroons, sovereign, status, and, trade, rights, in, their, inland, territories, giving, them, autonomy, slavery, in, brazil, began, long, before, the, first, portuguese, settlement, was, established, in, 1532, as, members, of, one, tribe, would, enslave, captured, members, of, another, later, portuguese, colonists, were, heavily, dependent, on, indigenous, labour, during, the, initial, phases, of, settlement, to, maintain, the, subsistence, economy, and, natives, were, often, captured, by, expeditions, called, bandeiras, the, importation, of, african, slaves, began, midway, through, the, 16th, century, but, the, enslavement, of, indigenous, peoples, continued, well, into, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, during, the, atlantic, slave, trade, era, brazil, imported, more, african, slaves, than, any, other, country, nearly, 5, million, slaves, were, brought, from, africa, to, brazil, during, the, period, from, 1501, to, 1866, until, the, early, 1850s, most, african, slaves, who, arrived, on, brazilian, shores, were, forced, to, embark, at, west, central, african, ports, especially, in, luanda, in, present, day, angola, today, with, the, exception, of, nigeria, the, country, with, the, largest, population, of, people, of, african, descent, is, brazil, slave, labour, was, the, driving, force, behind, the, growth, of, the, sugar, economy, in, brazil, and, sugar, was, the, primary, export, of, the, colony, from, 1600, to, 1650, gold, and, diamond, deposits, were, discovered, in, brazil, in, 1690, which, sparked, an, increase, in, the, importation, of, african, slaves, to, power, this, newly, profitable, market, transportation, systems, were, developed, for, the, mining, infrastructure, and, population, boomed, from, immigrants, seeking, to, take, part, in, gold, and, diamond, mining, demand, for, african, slaves, did, not, wane, after, the, decline, of, the, mining, industry, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, cattle, ranching, and, foodstuff, production, proliferated, after, the, population, growth, both, of, which, relied, heavily, on, slave, labour, 1, 7, million, slaves, were, imported, to, brazil, from, africa, from, 1700, to, 1800, and, the, rise, of, coffee, in, the, 1830s, further, enticed, expansion, of, the, slave, trade, brazil, was, the, last, country, in, the, western, world, to, abolish, slavery, forty, percent, of, the, total, number, of, slaves, brought, to, the, americas, were, sent, to, brazil, for, reference, the, united, states, received, 10, percent, despite, being, abolished, there, are, still, people, working, in, slavery, like, conditions, in, brazil, in, the, 21st, century, slavery, in, haiti, started, with, the, arrival, of, christopher, columbus, on, the, island, in, 1492, the, practice, was, devastating, to, the, native, population, following, the, indigenous, ta, no, s, near, decimation, from, forced, labour, disease, and, war, the, spanish, under, advisement, of, the, catholic, priest, bartolom, de, las, casas, and, with, the, blessing, of, the, catholic, church, who, also, wished, to, protect, the, indigenous, people, began, engaging, in, earnest, in, the, use, of, african, slaves, during, the, french, colonial, period, beginning, in, 1625, the, economy, of, haiti, then, known, as, saint, domingue, was, based, on, slavery, and, the, practice, there, was, regarded, as, the, most, brutal, in, the, world, following, the, treaty, of, ryswick, of, 1697, hispaniola, was, divided, between, france, and, spain, france, received, the, western, third, and, subsequently, named, it, saint, domingue, to, develop, it, into, sugarcane, plantations, the, french, imported, thousands, of, slaves, from, africa, sugar, was, a, lucrative, commodity, crop, throughout, the, 18th, century, by, 1789, approximately, 40, 000, white, colonists, lived, in, saint, domingue, the, whites, were, vastly, outnumbered, by, the, tens, of, thousands, of, african, slaves, they, had, imported, to, work, on, their, plantations, which, were, primarily, devoted, to, the, production, of, sugarcane, in, the, north, of, the, island, slaves, were, able, to, retain, many, ties, to, african, cultures, religion, and, language, these, ties, were, continually, being, renewed, by, newly, imported, africans, blacks, outnumbered, whites, by, about, ten, to, one, the, french, enacted, code, noir, black, code, prepared, by, jean, baptiste, colbert, and, ratified, by, louis, xiv, had, established, rules, on, slave, treatment, and, permissible, freedoms, saint, domingue, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, brutally, efficient, slave, colonies, one, third, of, newly, imported, africans, died, within, a, few, years, many, slaves, died, from, diseases, such, as, smallpox, and, typhoid, fever, they, had, birth, rates, around, 3, percent, and, there, is, evidence, that, some, women, aborted, fetuses, or, committed, infanticide, rather, than, allow, their, children, to, live, within, the, bonds, of, slavery, as, in, its, louisiana, colony, the, french, colonial, government, allowed, some, rights, to, free, people, of, color, the, mixed, race, descendants, of, white, male, colonists, and, black, female, slaves, and, later, mixed, race, women, over, time, many, were, released, from, slavery, they, established, a, separate, social, class, white, french, creole, fathers, frequently, sent, their, mixed, race, sons, to, france, for, their, education, some, men, of, color, were, admitted, into, the, military, more, of, the, free, people, of, color, lived, in, the, south, of, the, island, near, port, au, prince, and, many, intermarried, within, their, community, they, frequently, worked, as, artisans, and, tradesmen, and, began, to, own, some, property, some, became, slave, holders, the, free, people, of, color, petitioned, the, colonial, government, to, expand, their, rights, slaves, that, made, it, to, haiti, from, the, trans, atlantic, journey, and, slaves, born, in, haiti, were, first, documented, in, haiti, s, archives, and, transferred, to, france, s, ministry, of, defense, and, the, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, as, of, 2015, these, records, are, in, the, national, archives, of, france, according, to, the, 1788, census, haiti, s, population, consisted, of, nearly, 40, 000, whites, 30, 000, free, coloureds, and, 450, 000, slaves, the, haitian, revolution, of, 1804, the, only, successful, slave, revolt, in, human, history, precipitated, the, end, of, slavery, in, all, french, colonies, which, came, in, 1848, slavery, in, the, united, states, was, the, legal, institution, of, human, chattel, enslavement, primarily, of, africans, and, african, americans, that, existed, in, the, united, states, of, america, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, after, it, gained, independence, from, the, british, and, before, the, end, of, the, american, civil, war, slavery, had, been, practiced, in, british, america, from, early, colonial, days, and, was, legal, in, all, thirteen, colonies, at, the, time, of, the, declaration, of, independence, in, 1776, by, the, time, of, the, american, revolution, the, status, of, slave, had, been, institutionalized, as, a, racial, caste, associated, with, african, ancestry, the, united, states, became, polarized, over, the, issue, of, slavery, represented, by, the, slave, and, free, states, divided, by, the, mason, dixon, line, which, separated, free, pennsylvania, from, slave, maryland, and, delaware, congress, during, the, jefferson, administration, prohibited, the, importation, of, slaves, effective, 1808, although, smuggling, illegal, importing, was, not, unusual, domestic, slave, trading, however, continued, at, a, rapid, pace, driven, by, labour, demands, from, the, development, of, cotton, plantations, in, the, deep, south, those, states, attempted, to, extend, slavery, into, the, new, western, territories, to, keep, their, share, of, political, power, in, the, nation, such, laws, proposed, to, congress, to, continue, the, spread, of, slavery, into, newly, ratified, states, include, the, kansas, nebraska, act, the, treatment, of, slaves, in, the, united, states, varied, widely, depending, on, conditions, times, and, places, the, power, relationships, of, slavery, corrupted, many, whites, who, had, authority, over, slaves, with, children, showing, their, own, cruelty, masters, and, overseers, resorted, to, physical, punishments, to, impose, their, wills, slaves, were, punished, by, whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding, and, imprisonment, punishment, was, most, often, meted, out, in, response, to, disobedience, or, perceived, infractions, but, sometimes, abuse, was, carried, out, to, re, assert, the, dominance, of, the, master, or, overseer, of, the, slave, treatment, was, usually, harsher, on, large, plantations, which, were, often, managed, by, overseers, and, owned, by, absentee, slaveholders, william, wells, brown, who, escaped, to, freedom, reported, that, on, one, plantation, slave, men, were, required, to, pick, 80, pounds, 36, kg, of, cotton, per, day, while, women, were, required, to, pick, 70, pounds, 32, kg, per, day, if, any, slave, failed, in, their, quota, they, were, subject, to, whip, lashes, for, each, pound, they, were, short, the, whipping, post, stood, next, to, the, cotton, scales, a, new, york, man, who, attended, a, slave, auction, in, the, mid, 19th, century, reported, that, at, least, three, quarters, of, the, male, slaves, he, saw, at, sale, had, scars, on, their, backs, from, whipping, by, contrast, small, slave, owning, families, had, closer, relationships, between, the, owners, and, slaves, this, sometimes, resulted, in, a, more, humane, environment, but, was, not, a, given, more, than, one, million, slaves, were, sold, from, the, upper, south, which, had, a, surplus, of, labour, and, taken, to, the, deep, south, in, a, forced, migration, splitting, up, many, families, new, communities, of, african, american, culture, were, developed, in, the, deep, south, and, the, total, slave, population, in, the, south, eventually, reached, 4, million, before, liberation, in, the, 19th, century, proponents, of, slavery, often, defended, the, institution, as, a, necessary, evil, white, people, of, that, time, feared, that, emancipation, of, black, slaves, would, have, more, harmful, social, and, economic, consequences, than, the, continuation, of, slavery, the, french, writer, and, traveler, alexis, de, tocqueville, in, democracy, in, america, 1835, expressed, opposition, to, slavery, while, observing, its, effects, on, american, society, he, felt, that, a, multiracial, society, without, slavery, was, untenable, as, he, believed, that, prejudice, against, black, people, increased, as, they, were, granted, more, rights, others, like, james, henry, hammond, argued, that, slavery, was, a, positive, good, stating, such, a, class, you, must, have, or, you, would, not, have, that, other, class, which, leads, progress, civilization, and, refinement, the, southern, state, governments, wanted, to, keep, a, balance, between, the, number, of, slave, and, free, states, to, maintain, a, political, balance, of, power, in, congress, the, new, territories, acquired, from, britain, france, and, mexico, were, the, subject, of, major, political, compromises, by, 1850, the, newly, rich, cotton, growing, south, was, threatening, to, secede, from, the, union, and, tensions, continued, to, rise, many, white, southern, christians, including, church, ministers, attempted, to, justify, their, support, for, slavery, as, modified, by, christian, paternalism, the, largest, denominations, the, baptist, methodist, and, presbyterian, churches, split, over, the, slavery, issue, into, regional, organizations, of, the, north, and, south, when, abraham, lincoln, won, the, 1860, election, on, a, platform, of, halting, the, expansion, of, slavery, according, to, the, 1860, u, s, census, roughly, 400, 000, individuals, representing, 8, of, all, u, s, families, owned, nearly, 4, 000, 000, slaves, one, third, of, southern, families, owned, slaves, the, south, was, heavily, invested, in, slavery, as, such, upon, lincoln, s, election, seven, states, broke, away, to, form, the, confederate, states, of, america, the, first, six, states, to, secede, held, the, greatest, number, of, slaves, in, the, south, shortly, after, over, the, issue, of, slavery, the, united, states, erupted, into, an, all, out, civil, war, with, slavery, legally, ceasing, as, an, institution, following, the, war, in, december, 1865, in, 1865, the, united, states, ratified, the, 13th, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, which, banned, slavery, and, involuntary, servitude, except, as, punishment, for, a, crime, whereof, the, party, shall, have, been, duly, convicted, providing, a, legal, basis, for, forced, labor, to, continue, in, the, country, this, led, to, the, system, of, convict, leasing, which,

by, governments, as, a, means, of, maintaining, a, public, labour, force, until, the, han, dynasty, slaves, were, sometimes, discriminated, against, but, their, legal, status, was, guaranteed, as, can, be, seen, from, the, some, historical, records, as, duansheng, marquis, of, shouxiang, had, his, territory, confiscated, because, he, killed, a, female, slave, han, dynasty, records, in, dongguan, wang, mang, s, son, wang, huo, murdered, a, slave, wang, mang, severely, criticized, him, and, forced, him, to, commit, suicide, book, of, han, biography, of, wang, mang, murder, against, slaves, was, as, taboo, as, murder, against, free, people, and, perpetrators, were, always, severely, punished, han, dynasty, can, be, said, to, be, very, distinctive, compared, to, other, countries, of, the, same, period, in, most, cases, lords, were, free, to, kill, their, slaves, in, terms, of, slaves, human, rights, after, the, southern, and, northern, dynasties, due, to, years, of, poor, harvests, the, influx, of, foreign, tribes, and, the, resulting, wars, the, number, of, slaves, exploded, they, became, a, class, and, were, called, jianmin, chinese, the, word, literally, means, inferior, person, as, stated, in, the, commentary, of, tang, code, slaves, and, inferior, people, are, legally, equivalent, to, livestock, products, they, always, had, a, low, social, status, and, even, if, they, were, deliberately, murdered, the, perpetrators, received, only, a, year, in, prison, and, were, punished, even, when, they, reported, the, crimes, of, their, lords, however, in, the, later, period, of, the, dynasty, perhaps, because, the, increase, in, the, number, of, slaves, slowed, down, again, the, penalties, for, crimes, against, them, became, harsh, again, for, example, the, famous, contemporary, female, poet, yu, xuanji, she, was, publicly, executed, for, murdering, her, own, slave, many, han, chinese, were, enslaved, in, the, process, of, the, mongol, invasion, of, china, proper, according, to, japanese, historians, sugiyama, masaaki, and, funada, yoshiyuki, mongolian, slaves, were, owned, by, han, chinese, during, the, yuan, dynasty, slavery, has, taken, various, forms, throughout, china, s, history, it, was, reportedly, abolished, as, a, legally, recognized, institution, including, in, a, 1909, law, fully, enacted, in, 1910, although, the, practice, continued, until, at, least, 1949, tang, chinese, soldiers, and, pirates, enslaved, koreans, turks, persians, indonesians, and, people, from, inner, mongolia, central, asia, and, northern, india, the, greatest, source, of, slaves, came, from, southern, tribes, including, thais, and, aboriginals, from, the, southern, provinces, of, fujian, guangdong, guangxi, and, guizhou, malays, khmers, indians, and, black, skinned, peoples, who, were, either, austronesian, negritos, of, southeast, asia, and, the, pacific, islands, or, africans, or, both, were, also, purchased, as, slaves, in, the, tang, dynasty, in, the, 17th, century, qing, dynasty, there, was, a, hereditarily, servile, people, called, booi, aha, manchu, booi, niyalma, chinese, transliteration, which, is, a, manchu, word, literally, translated, as, household, person, and, sometimes, rendered, as, nucai, the, manchu, was, establishing, close, personal, and, paternalist, relationship, between, masters, and, their, slaves, as, nurhachi, said, the, master, should, love, the, slaves, and, eat, the, same, food, as, him, however, booi, aha, did, not, correspond, exactly, to, the, chinese, category, of, bond, servant, slave, chinese, instead, it, was, a, relationship, of, personal, dependency, on, a, master, which, in, theory, guaranteed, close, personal, relationships, and, equal, treatment, even, though, many, western, scholars, would, directly, translate, booi, as, bond, servant, some, of, the, booi, even, had, their, own, servant, chinese, muslim, tungans, sufis, who, were, charged, with, practicing, xiejiao, heterodox, religion, were, punished, by, exile, to, xinjiang, and, being, sold, as, a, slave, to, other, muslims, such, as, the, sufi, begs, han, chinese, who, committed, crimes, such, as, those, dealing, with, opium, became, slaves, to, the, begs, this, practice, was, administered, by, qing, law, most, chinese, in, altishahr, were, exile, slaves, to, turkestani, begs, while, free, chinese, merchants, generally, did, not, engage, in, relationships, with, east, turkestani, women, some, of, the, chinese, slaves, belonging, to, begs, along, with, green, standard, soldiers, bannermen, and, manchus, engaged, in, affairs, with, the, east, turkestani, women, that, were, serious, in, nature, slavery, in, korea, existed, since, before, the, three, kingdoms, of, korea, period, in, the, first, century, bce, slavery, has, been, described, as, very, important, in, medieval, korea, probably, more, important, than, in, any, other, east, asian, country, but, by, the, 16th, century, population, growth, was, making, unnecessary, slavery, went, into, decline, around, the, 10th, century, but, came, back, in, the, late, goryeo, period, when, korea, also, experienced, multiple, slave, rebellions, in, the, joseon, period, of, korea, members, of, the, slave, class, were, known, as, nobi, the, nobi, were, socially, indistinct, from, freemen, i, e, the, middle, and, common, classes, other, than, the, ruling, yangban, class, and, some, possessed, property, rights, and, legal, and, civil, rights, hence, some, scholars, argue, that, it, is, inappropriate, to, call, them, slaves, while, some, scholars, describe, them, as, serfs, the, nobi, population, could, fluctuate, up, to, about, one, third, of, the, total, but, on, average, the, nobi, made, up, about, 10, of, the, total, population, in, 1801, the, majority, of, government, nobi, were, emancipated, and, by, 1858, the, nobi, population, stood, at, about, 1, 5, percent, of, the, korean, population, during, the, joseon, period, the, nobi, population, could, fluctuate, up, to, about, one, third, of, the, population, but, on, average, the, nobi, made, up, about, 10, of, the, total, population, the, nobi, system, declined, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, since, the, outset, of, the, joseon, dynasty, and, especially, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, there, was, harsh, criticism, among, prominent, thinkers, in, korea, about, the, nobi, system, even, within, the, joseon, government, there, were, indications, of, a, shift, in, attitude, toward, the, nobi, king, yeongjo, implemented, a, policy, of, gradual, emancipation, in, 1775, and, he, and, his, successor, king, jeongjo, made, many, proposals, and, developments, that, lessened, the, burden, on, nobi, which, led, to, the, emancipation, of, the, vast, majority, of, government, nobi, in, 1801, in, addition, population, growth, numerous, escaped, slaves, growing, commercialization, of, agriculture, and, the, rise, of, the, independent, small, farmer, class, contributed, to, the, decline, in, the, number, of, nobi, to, about, 1, 5, of, the, total, population, by, 1858, the, hereditary, nobi, system, was, officially, abolished, around, 1886, 87, and, the, rest, of, the, nobi, system, was, abolished, with, the, gabo, reform, of, 1894, however, slavery, did, not, completely, disappear, in, korea, until, 1930, during, imperial, japanese, rule, during, the, imperial, japanese, occupation, of, korea, around, world, war, ii, some, koreans, were, used, in, forced, labour, by, the, imperial, japanese, in, conditions, which, have, been, compared, to, slavery, these, included, women, forced, into, sexual, slavery, by, the, imperial, japanese, army, before, and, during, world, war, ii, known, as, comfort, women, after, the, portuguese, first, made, contact, with, japan, in, 1543, slave, trade, developed, in, which, portuguese, purchased, japanese, as, slaves, in, japan, and, sold, them, to, various, locations, overseas, including, portugal, throughout, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, many, documents, mention, the, slave, trade, along, with, protests, against, the, enslavement, of, japanese, japanese, slaves, are, believed, to, be, the, first, of, their, nation, to, end, up, in, europe, and, the, portuguese, purchased, numbers, of, japanese, slave, girls, to, bring, to, portugal, for, sexual, purposes, as, noted, by, the, church, in, 1555, japanese, slave, women, were, even, sold, as, concubines, to, asian, lascar, and, african, crew, members, along, with, their, european, counterparts, serving, on, portuguese, ships, trading, in, japan, mentioned, by, luis, cerqueira, a, portuguese, jesuit, in, a, 1598, document, japanese, slaves, were, brought, by, the, portuguese, to, macau, where, they, were, enslaved, to, portuguese, or, became, slaves, to, other, slaves, some, korean, slaves, were, bought, by, the, portuguese, and, brought, back, to, portugal, from, japan, where, they, had, been, among, the, tens, of, thousands, of, korean, prisoners, of, war, transported, to, japan, during, the, japanese, invasions, of, korea, 1592, 98, historians, pointed, out, that, at, the, same, time, hideyoshi, expressed, his, indignation, and, outrage, at, the, portuguese, trade, in, japanese, slaves, he, was, engaging, in, a, mass, slave, trade, of, korean, prisoners, of, war, in, japan, fillippo, sassetti, saw, some, chinese, and, japanese, slaves, in, lisbon, among, the, large, slave, community, in, 1578, although, most, of, the, slaves, were, black, the, portuguese, also, valued, oriental, slaves, more, than, the, black, africans, and, the, moors, for, their, rarity, chinese, slaves, were, more, expensive, than, moors, and, blacks, and, showed, off, the, high, status, of, the, owner, the, portuguese, attributed, qualities, like, intelligence, and, industriousness, to, chinese, japanese, and, indian, slaves, king, sebastian, of, portugal, feared, rampant, slavery, was, having, a, negative, effect, on, catholic, proselytization, so, he, commanded, that, it, be, banned, in, 1571, hideyoshi, was, so, disgusted, that, his, own, japanese, people, were, being, sold, en, masse, into, slavery, on, kyushu, that, he, wrote, a, letter, to, jesuit, vice, provincial, gaspar, coelho, on, july, 24, 1587, to, demand, the, portuguese, siamese, thai, and, cambodians, stop, purchasing, and, enslaving, japanese, and, return, japanese, slaves, who, ended, up, as, far, as, india, hideyoshi, blamed, the, portuguese, and, jesuits, for, this, slave, trade, and, banned, christian, proselytizing, as, a, result, in, 1595, a, law, was, passed, by, portugal, banning, the, selling, and, buying, of, chinese, and, japanese, slaves, slavery, in, india, was, widespread, by, the, 6th, century, bc, and, perhaps, even, as, far, back, as, the, vedic, period, slavery, intensified, during, the, muslim, domination, of, northern, india, after, the, 11th, century, slavery, existed, in, portuguese, india, after, the, 16th, century, the, dutch, too, largely, dealt, in, abyssian, slaves, known, in, india, as, habshis, or, sheedes, arakan, bengal, malabar, and, coromandel, remained, the, largest, sources, of, forced, labour, until, the, 1660s, between, 1626, and, 1662, the, dutch, exported, on, an, average, 150, 400, slaves, annually, from, the, arakan, bengal, coast, during, the, first, 30, years, of, batavia, s, existence, indian, and, arakanese, slaves, provided, the, main, labour, force, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, asian, headquarters, an, increase, in, coromandel, slaves, occurred, during, a, famine, following, the, revolt, of, the, nayaka, indian, rulers, of, south, india, tanjavur, senji, and, madurai, against, bijapur, overlordship, 1645, and, the, subsequent, devastation, of, the, tanjavur, countryside, by, the, bijapur, army, reportedly, more, than, 150, 000, people, were, taken, by, the, invading, deccani, muslim, armies, to, bijapur, and, golconda, in, 1646, 2, 118, slaves, were, exported, to, batavia, the, overwhelming, majority, from, southern, coromandel, some, slaves, were, also, acquired, further, south, at, tondi, adirampatnam, and, kayalpatnam, another, increase, in, slaving, took, place, between, 1659, and, 1661, from, tanjavur, as, a, result, of, a, series, of, successive, bijapuri, raids, at, nagapatnam, pulicat, and, elsewhere, the, company, purchased, 8, 000, 10, 000, slaves, the, bulk, of, whom, were, sent, to, ceylon, while, a, small, portion, were, exported, to, batavia, and, malacca, finally, following, a, long, drought, in, madurai, and, southern, coromandel, in, 1673, which, intensified, the, prolonged, madurai, maratha, struggle, over, tanjavur, and, punitive, fiscal, practices, thousands, of, people, from, tanjavur, mostly, children, were, sold, into, slavery, and, exported, by, asian, traders, from, nagapattinam, to, aceh, johor, and, other, slave, markets, in, september, 1687, 665, slaves, were, exported, by, the, english, from, fort, st, george, madras, and, in, 1694, 96, when, warfare, once, more, ravaged, south, india, a, total, of, 3, 859, slaves, were, imported, from, coromandel, by, private, individuals, into, ceylon, the, volume, of, the, total, dutch, indian, ocean, slave, trade, has, been, estimated, to, be, about, 15, 30, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, slightly, smaller, than, the, trans, saharan, slave, trade, and, one, and, a, half, to, three, times, the, size, of, the, swahili, and, red, sea, coast, and, the, dutch, west, india, company, slave, trades, according, to, sir, henry,

off, as, slaves, by, the, siamese, thai, the, anamites, vietnamese, and, the, cambodians, a, siamese, military, campaign, in, laos, in, 1876, was, described, by, a, british, observer, as, having, been, transformed, into, slave, hunting, raids, on, a, large, scale, the, census, taken, in, 1879, showed, that, 6, of, the, population, in, the, malay, sultanate, of, perak, were, slaves, enslaved,

gulag, stalin, s, gulag, was, in, many, ways, less, a, concentration, camp, than, a, forced, labor, camp, and, less, a, prison, system, than, a, system, of, slavery, the, image, of, the, slave, appears, often, in, gulag, memoir, literature, as, varlam, shalamov, wrote, hungry, and, exhausted, we, leaned, into, a, horse, collar, raising, blood, blisters, on, our, chests, and, pulling, a,

forced, labor, and, other, forms, of, slave, labor, would, be, worthy, of, scholarly, attention, in, my, view, for, as, in, the, case, of, global, slavery, the, gulag, found, legitimacy, in, an, elaborate, narrative, of, difference, that, involved, the, presumption, of, dangerousness, and, guilt, this, ideology, of, difference, and, the, violence, of, human, exploitation, have, left, lasting, legacies, in, contemporary, russia, historian, anne, applebaum, writes, in, the, introduction, of, her, book, that, the, word, gulag, has, come, to, represent, the, system, of, soviet, slave, labor, itself, in, all, its, forms, and, varieties, the, word, gulag, is, an, acronym, for, glavnoe, upravlenie, lagerei, or, main, camp, administration, the, institution, which, ran, the, soviet, camps, but, over, time, the, word, has, also, come, to, signify, the, system, of, soviet, slave, labor, itself, in, all, its, forms, and, varieties, labor, camps, punishment, camps, criminal, and, political, camps, women, s, camps, children, s, camps, transit, camps, even, more, broadly, gulag, has, come, to, mean, the, soviet, repressive, system, itself, the, set, of, procedures, that, alexander, solzhenitsyn, once, called, our, meat, grinder, the, arrests, the, interrogations, the, transport, in, unheated, cattle, cars, the, forced, labor, the, destruction, of, families, the, years, spent, in, exile, the, early, and, unnecessary, deaths, applebaum, s, introduction, has, been, criticized, by, gulag, researcher, wilson, bell, stating, that, her, book, is, aside, from, the, introduction, a, well, done, overview, of, the, gulag, but, it, did, not, offer, an, interpretative, framework, much, beyond, solzhenitsyn, s, paradigms, in, the, earliest, known, records, slavery, is, treated, as, an, established, institution, the, code, of, hammurabi, c, 1760, bc, for, example, prescribed, death, for, anyone, who, helped, a, slave, escape, or, who, sheltered, a, fugitive, the, bible, mentions,

those, formerly, held, as, slaves, or, for, their, descendants, claims, for, reparations, for, being, held, in, slavery, are, handled, as, a, civil, law, matter, in, almost, every, country, this, is, often, decried, as, a, serious, problem, since, former, slaves, relatives, lack, of, money, means, they, often, have, limited, access, to, a, potentially, expensive, and, futile, legal, process, mandatory, systems, of, fines, and, reparations, paid, to, an, as, yet, undetermined, group, of, claimants, from, fines, paid, by, unspecified, parties, and, collected, by, authorities, have, been, proposed, by, advocates, to, alleviate, this, civil, court, problem, since, in, almost, all, cases, there, are, no, living, ex, slaves, or, living, ex, slave, owners, these, movements, have, gained, little, traction, in, nearly, all, cases, the, judicial, system, has, ruled, that, the, statute, of, limitations, on, these, possible, claims, has, long, since, expired, in, june, 2023, the, brattle,

with, the, wind, 1939, became, controversial, because, they, gave, a, favourable, depiction, in, 1940, the, santa, fe, trail, gave, a, liberal, but, ambiguous, interpretation, of, john, brown, s,
