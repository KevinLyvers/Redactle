populism, is, a, range, of, political, stances, that, emphasize, the, idea, of, the, people, and, often, juxtapose, this, group, with, the, elite, it, is, frequently, associated, with, anti, establishment, and, anti, political, sentiment, the, term, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, has, been, applied, to, various, politicians, parties, and, movements, since, that, time, often, as, a, pejorative, within, political, science, and, other, social, sciences, several, different, definitions, of, populism, have, been, employed, with, some, scholars, proposing, that, the, term, be, rejected, altogether, a, common, framework, for, interpreting, populism, is, known, as, the, ideational, approach, this, defines, populism, as, an, ideology, that, presents, the, people, as, a, morally, good, force, and, contrasts, them, against, the, elite, who, are, portrayed, as, corrupt, and, self, serving, populists, differ, in, how, the, people, are, defined, but, it, can, be, based, along, class, ethnic, or, national, lines, populists, typically, present, the, elite, as, comprising, the, political, economic, cultural, and, media, establishment, depicted, as, a, homogeneous, entity, and, accused, of, placing, their, own, interests, and, often, the, interests, of, other, groups, such, as, large, corporations, foreign, countries, or, immigrants, above, the, interests, of, the, people, according, to, the, ideational, approach, populism, is, often, combined, with, other, ideologies, such, as, nationalism, liberalism, socialism, capitalism, or, consumerism, thus, populists, can, be, found, at, different, locations, along, the, left, right, political, spectrum, and, there, exist, both, left, wing, populism, and, right, wing, populism, other, scholars, of, the, social, sciences, have, defined, the, term, populism, differently, according, to, the, popular, agency, definition, used, by, some, historians, of, united, states, history, populism, refers, to, popular, engagement, of, the, population, in, political, decision, making, an, approach, associated, with, the, political, scientist, ernesto, laclau, presents, populism, as, an, emancipatory, social, force, through, which, marginalised, groups, challenge, dominant, power, structures, some, economists, have, used, the, term, in, reference, to, governments, which, engage, in, substantial, public, spending, financed, by, foreign, loans, resulting, in, hyperinflation, and, emergency, measures, in, popular, discourse, where, the, term, has, often, been, used, pejoratively, it, has, sometimes, been, used, synonymously, with, demagogy, to, describe, politicians, who, present, overly, simplistic, answers, to, complex, questions, in, a, highly, emotional, manner, or, with, political, opportunism, to, characterise, politicians, who, exploit, problems, and, seek, to, please, voters, without, rational, consideration, as, to, the, best, course, of, action, some, scholars, have, linked, populist, policies, to, adverse, economic, outcomes, as, economic, disintegration, decreasing, macroeconomic, stability, and, the, erosion, of, institutions, typically, go, hand, in, hand, with, populist, rule, although, frequently, used, by, historians, social, scientists, and, political, commentators, the, term, is, exceptionally, vague, and, refers, in, different, contexts, to, a, bewildering, variety, of, phenomena, margaret, canovan, 1981, the, word, populism, has, been, contested, mistranslated, and, used, in, reference, to, a, diverse, variety, of, movements, and, beliefs, the, political, scientist, will, brett, characterised, it, as, a, classic, example, of, a, stretched, concept, pulled, out, of, shape, by, overuse, and, misuse, while, the, political, scientist, paul, taggart, has, said, of, populism, that, it, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, but, poorly, understood, political, concepts, of, our, time, in, 1858, an, english, translator, for, alphonse, de, lamartine, used, the, term, as, an, antonym, for, aristocratic, in, the, russian, empire, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, a, left, leaning, agrarian, group, referred, to, itself, as, the, narodniki, which, has, often, been, translated, into, english, as, populists, but, the, first, major, use, of, the, term, in, english, was, by, members, of, the, left, leaning, agrarian, people, s, party, and, its, predecessors, which, were, active, in, the, united, states, from, around, 1889, to, 1909, the, russian, and, american, movements, differed, in, various, respects, in, the, 1920s, the, term, entered, the, french, language, where, it, was, used, to, describe, a, group, of, writers, expressing, sympathy, for, ordinary, people, as, the, term, has, rarely, been, used, as, a, political, self, designation, since, the, first, decade, of, the, 1900s, its, meaning, has, broadened, as, noted, by, the, political, scientist, margaret, canovan, there, has, been, no, self, conscious, international, populist, movement, which, might, have, attempted, to, control, or, limit, the, term, s, reference, and, as, a, result, those, who, have, used, it, have, been, able, to, attach, it, a, wide, variety, of, meanings, in, this, it, differs, from, other, political, terms, like, socialism, or, conservatism, which, have, been, widely, used, as, self, designations, by, individuals, who, have, then, presented, their, own, internal, definitions, of, the, word, instead, it, shares, similarities, with, terms, such, as, far, left, far, right, or, extremist, which, are, often, used, in, political, discourse, but, rarely, as, self, designations, in, news, media, the, term, populism, has, often, been, conflated, with, other, concepts, like, demagoguery, and, generally, presented, as, something, to, be, feared, and, discredited, it, has, often, been, applied, to, movements, that, are, considered, to, be, outside, the, political, mainstream, or, a, threat, to, democracy, the, political, scientists, yves, m, ny, and, yves, surel, noted, that, populism, had, become, a, catchword, particularly, in, the, media, to, designate, the, newborn, political, or, social, movements, which, challenge, the, entrenched, values, rules, and, institutions, of, democratic, orthodoxy, typically, the, term, is, used, against, others, often, in, a, pejorative, sense, to, discredit, opponents, some, of, those, who, have, repeatedly, been, referred, to, as, populists, in, a, pejorative, sense, have, subsequently, embraced, the, term, while, seeking, to, shed, it, of, negative, connotations, the, french, far, right, politician, jean, marie, le, pen, for, instance, was, often, accused, of, populism, and, eventually, responded, by, stating, that, populism, precisely, is, taking, into, account, the, people, s, opinion, have, people, the, right, in, a, democracy, to, hold, an, opinion, if, that, is, the, case, then, yes, i, am, a, populist, similarly, on, being, founded, in, 2003, the, centre, left, lithuanian, labour, party, declared, we, are, and, will, be, called, populists, following, 2016, the, year, which, saw, the, election, of, donald, trump, as, president, of, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, s, vote, to, leave, the, european, union, both, events, linked, to, populism, the, word, populism, became, one, of, the, most, widely, used, terms, by, international, political, commentators, in, 2017, the, cambridge, dictionary, declared, it, the, word, of, the, year, until, the, 1950s, use, of, the, term, populism, remained, restricted, largely, to, historians, studying, the, people, s, party, but, in, 1954, the, us, sociologist, edward, shils, published, an, article, proposing, populism, as, a, term, to, describe, anti, elite, trends, in, us, society, more, broadly, following, on, from, shils, article, during, the, 1960s, the, term, populism, became, increasingly, popular, among, sociologists, and, other, academics, in, the, social, sciences, in, 1967, a, conference, on, populism, was, held, at, the, london, school, of, economics, the, participants, of, which, failed, to, agree, on, a, clear, single, definition, as, a, result, of, this, scholarly, interest, an, academic, field, known, as, populism, studies, emerged, interest, in, the, subject, grew, rapidly, between, 1950, and, 1960, about, 160, publications, on, populism, appeared, while, between, 1990, and, 2000, that, number, was, over, 1500, from, 2000, to, 2015, about, 95, papers, and, books, including, the, term, populism, were, catalogued, each, year, by, web, of, science, in, 2016, it, grew, to, 266, in, 2017, it, was, 488, and, in, 2018, it, was, 615, taggart, argued, that, this, academic, interest, was, not, consistent, but, appeared, in, bursts, of, research, that, reflected, the, political, conditions, of, the, time, canovan, noted, that, if, the, notion, of, populism, did, not, exist, no, social, scientist, would, deliberately, invent, it, the, term, is, far, too, ambiguous, for, that, from, examining, how, the, term, populism, had, been, used, she, proposed, that, seven, different, types, of, populism, could, be, discerned, three, of, these, were, forms, of, agrarian, populism, these, included, farmers, radicalism, peasant, movements, and, intellectual, agrarian, socialism, the, other, four, were, forms, of, political, populism, representing, populist, dictatorship, populist, democracy, reactionary, populism, and, politicians, populism, she, noted, that, these, were, analytical, constructs, and, that, real, life, examples, may, well, overlap, several, categories, adding, that, no, single, political, movement, fitted, into, all, seven, categories, in, this, way, canovan, conceived, of, populism, as, a, family, of, related, concepts, rather, than, as, a, single, concept, in, itself, the, confusion, surrounding, the, term, has, led, some, scholars, to, suggest, that, it, should, be, abandoned, by, scholarship, in, contrast, to, this, view, the, political, scientists, cas, mudde, and, crist, bal, rovira, kaltwasser, stated, that, while, the, frustration, is, understandable, the, term, populism, is, too, central, to, debates, about, politics, from, europe, to, the, americas, to, simply, do, away, with, similarly, canovan, noted, that, the, term, does, have, comparatively, clear, and, definite, meanings, in, a, number, of, specialist, areas, and, that, it, provides, a, pointer, however, shaky, to, an, interesting, and, largely, unexplored, area, of, political, and, social, experience, the, political, scientists, daniele, albertazzi, and, duncan, mcdonnell, thought, that, if, carefully, defined, the, term, populism, can, be, used, profitably, to, help, us, understand, and, explain, a, wide, array, of, political, actors, the, political, scientist, ben, stanley, noted, that, although, the, meaning, of, the, term, has, proven, controversial, in, the, literature, the, persistence, with, which, it, has, recurred, suggests, the, existence, at, least, of, an, ineliminable, core, that, is, that, it, refers, to, a, distinct, pattern, of, ideas, political, scientist, david, art, argues, that, the, concept, of, populism, brings, together, disparate, phenomena, in, an, unhelpful, manner, and, ultimately, obscures, and, legitimizes, figures, who, are, more, comprehensively, defined, as, nativists, and, authoritarians, although, academic, definitions, of, populism, have, differed, most, of, them, have, focused, on, the, idea, that, it, should, reference, some, form, of, relationship, between, the, people, and, the, elite, and, that, it, entailed, taking, an, anti, establishment, stance, beyond, that, different, scholars, have, emphasised, different, features, that, they, wish, to, use, to, define, populism, these, differences, have, occurred, both, within, specific, scholarly, disciplines, and, among, different, disciplines, varying, for, instance, among, scholars, focusing, on, different, regions, and, different, historical, periods, author, thomas, frank, has, criticized, the, common, use, of, the, term, populism, to, refer, to, far, right, nativism, and, racism, noting, that, the, original, people, s, party, was, relatively, liberal, on, the, rights, of, women, and, minorities, by, the, standards, of, the, time, the, v, party, dataset, assesses, populism, as, anti, elitism, and, people, centrism, a, thin, centred, ideology, that, considers, society, to, be, ultimately, separated, into, two, homogenous, and, antagonistic, camps, the, pure, people, versus, the, corrupt, elite, and, which, argues, that, politics, should, be, an, expression, of, the, volont, g, n, rale, general, will, of, the, people, the, ideational, definition, of, populism, used, by, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, a, common, approach, to, defining, populism, is, known, as, the, ideational, approach, this, emphasises, the, notion, that, populism, should, be, defined, according, to, specific, ideas, which, underlie, it, as, opposed, to, certain, economic, policies, or, leadership, styles, which, populist, politicians, may, display, in, this, definition, the, term, populism, is, applied, to, political, groups, and, individuals, who, make, appeals, to, the, people, and, then, contrast, this, group, against, the, elite, adopting, this, approach, albertazzi, and, mcdonnell, define, populism, as, an, ideology, that, pits, a, virtuous, and, homogeneous, people, against, a, set, of, elites, and, dangerous, others, who, are, together, depicted, as, depriving, or, attempting, to, deprive, the, sovereign, people, of, their, rights, values, prosperity, identity, and, voice, similarly, the, political, scientist, carlos, de, la, torre, defined, populism, as, a, manichean, discourse, that, divides, politics, and, society, as, the, struggle, between, two, irreconcilable, and, antagonistic, camps, the, people, and, the, oligarchy, or, the, power, block, in, this, understanding, note, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, populism, always, involves, a, critique, of, the, establishment, and, an, adulation, of, the, common, people, and, according, to, ben, stanley, populism, itself, is, a, product, of, an, antagonistic, relationship, between, the, people, and, the, elite, and, is, latent, wherever, the, possibility, occurs, for, the, emergence, of, such, a, dichotomy, the, political, scientist, manuel, anselmi, proposed, that, populism, be, defined, as, featuring, a, homogeneous, community, people, which, perceives, itself, as, the, absolute, holder, of, popular, sovereignty, and, expresses, an, anti, establishment, attitude, this, understanding, conceives, of, populism, as, a, discourse, ideology, or, worldview, these, definitions, were, initially, employed, largely, in, western, europe, although, later, became, increasingly, popular, in, eastern, europe, and, the, americas, according, to, this, approach, populism, is, viewed, as, a, thin, ideology, or, thin, centred, ideology, which, on, its, own, is, seen, as, too, insubstantial, to, provide, a, blueprint, for, societal, change, it, thus, differs, from, the, thick, centred, or, full, ideologies, such, as, fascism, liberalism, and, socialism, which, provide, more, far, reaching, ideas, about, social, transformation, as, a, thin, centred, ideology, populism, is, therefore, attached, to, a, thick, ideology, by, populist, politicians, thus, populism, can, be, found, merged, with, forms, of, nationalism, liberalism, socialism, federalism, or, conservatism, according, to, stanley, the, thinness, of, populism, ensures, that, in, practice, it, is, a, complementary, ideology, it, does, not, so, much, overlap, with, as, diffuse, itself, throughout, full, ideologies, populism, is, according, to, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, a, kind, of, mental, map, through, which, individuals, analyse, and, comprehend, political, reality, mudde, noted, that, populism, is, moralistic, rather, than, programmatic, it, encourages, a, binary, world, view, in, which, everyone, is, divided, into, friends, and, foes, with, the, latter, being, regarded, not, just, as, people, who, have, different, priorities, and, values, but, as, being, fundamentally, evil, in, emphasising, one, s, purity, against, the, corruption, and, immorality, of, the, elite, from, which, the, people, must, remain, pure, and, untouched, populism, prevents, compromise, between, different, groups, the, incredible, rise, in, research, and, discussion, about, populism, both, academic, and, social, stems, largely, from, efforts, by, ideational, scholars, to, place, centre, stage, the, significance, of, appeals, to, the, people, beyond, ideological, differences, and, to, conceptualise, populism, as, a, discursive, phenomenon, nevertheless, the, ideational, school, s, approach, to, populism, is, problematic, for, the, amount, of, substantive, assumptions, it, imposes, on, how, populism, actually, works, as, a, discursive, phenomenon, such, as, the, idea, that, it, is, of, a, moral, register, that, vindications, always, refer, to, a, homogeneous, pure, people, or, that, it, takes, shape, socially, as, an, ideology, these, assumptions, can, be, counter, productive, to, the, study, of, populism, which, has, arguably, become, excessively, conceptually, deductive, still, this, does, not, mean, we, cannot, come, to, a, more, minimal, formal, definition, of, what, populism, is, that, can, consensually, group, scholars, and, open, up, research, to, a, broader, scope, as, indicated, by, stavrakakis, and, de, cleen, in, defining, populism, as, a, type, of, discourse, characterized, by, a, people, elite, distinction, and, the, claim, to, speak, in, the, name, of, the, people, as, a, result, of, the, various, different, ideologies, with, which, populism, can, be, paired, the, forms, that, populism, can, take, vary, widely, populism, itself, cannot, be, positioned, on, the, left, right, political, spectrum, and, both, right, and, left, wing, populisms, exist, populist, movements, can, also, mix, divisions, between, left, and, right, for, instance, by, combining, xenophobic, attitudes, commonly, associated, with, the, far, right, with, redistributive, economic, policies, closer, to, those, of, the, left, core, consists, of, four, distinct, but, interrelated, concepts, the, ideational, definition, of, populism, used, by, ben, stanley, the, ideologies, with, which, populism, can, be, paired, can, be, contradictory, resulting, in, different, forms, of, populism, that, can, oppose, each, other, for, instance, in, latin, america, during, the, 1990s, populism, was, often, associated, with, politicians, like, peru, s, alberto, fujimori, who, promoted, neoliberal, economics, while, in, the, 2000s, it, was, instead, associated, with, those, like, venezuela, s, hugo, ch, vez, who, promoted, socialist, programs, as, well, as, populists, of, the, left, and, right, populist, figures, like, italy, s, beppe, grillo, have, been, characterised, as, centrist, and, liberal, while, groups, like, turkey, s, justice, and, development, party, have, been, described, as, combining, populism, with, islamism, and, india, s, bharatiya, janata, party, has, been, seen, as, mixing, populism, with, hindu, nationalism, although, populists, of, different, ideological, traditions, can, oppose, each, other, they, can, also, form, coalitions, as, was, seen, in, the, greek, coalition, government, which, brought, together, the, left, wing, populist, syriza, and, the, right, wing, populist, independent, greeks, in, 2015, adherents, of, the, ideational, definition, have, also, drawn, a, distinction, between, left, and, right, wing, populists, the, latter, are, presented, as, juxtaposing, the, people, against, both, the, elite, and, an, additional, group, who, are, also, regarded, as, being, separate, from, the, people, and, whom, the, elite, is, seen, to, favour, such, as, immigrants, homosexuals, travellers, or, communists, populist, leaders, thus, come, in, many, different, shades, and, sizes, but, according, to, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, share, one, common, element, a, carefully, crafted, image, of, the, vox, populi, stanley, expressed, the, view, that, although, there, are, certain, family, resemblances, that, can, be, seen, between, populist, groups, and, individuals, there, was, no, coherent, tradition, unifying, all, of, them, while, many, left, wing, parties, in, the, early, 20th, century, presented, themselves, as, the, vanguard, of, the, proletariat, by, the, early, 21st, century, left, wing, populists, were, presenting, themselves, as, the, voice, of, the, people, more, widely, on, the, political, right, populism, is, often, combined, with, nationalism, with, the, people, and, the, nation, becoming, fairly, interchangeable, categories, in, their, discourse, or, combined, with, religion, where, the, people, are, identified, based, on, religion, some, political, scientists, have, also, argued, that, populism, can, be, divided, into, left, wing, inclusionary, and, right, wing, exclusionary, forms, though, some, argue, against, a, dichotomy, between, inclusionary, and, exclusionary, forms, such, as, right, wing, populists, welcoming, culturally, proximate, migrants, with, transnational, solidarity, populists, claim, to, speak, in, the, name, of, the, oppressed, people, and, they, want, to, emancipate, them, by, making, them, aware, of, their, oppression, however, they, do, not, want, to, change, their, values, or, their, way, of, life, this, is, fundamentally, different, from, for, example, the, early, socialists, who, want, ed, to, uplift, the, workers, by, re, educating, them, thereby, liberating, them, from, their, false, consciousness, for, populists, on, the, other, hand, the, consciousness, of, the, people, generally, referred, to, as, common, sense, is, the, basis, of, all, good, politics, political, scientist, cas, mudde, for, populists, the, people, are, presented, as, being, homogeneous, and, also, virtuous, in, simplifying, the, complexities, of, reality, the, concept, of, the, people, is, vague, and, flexible, with, this, plasticity, benefitting, populists, who, are, thus, able, to, expand, or, contract, the, concept, to, suit, the, chosen, criteria, of, inclusion, or, exclusion, at, any, given, time, in, employing, the, concept, of, the, people, populists, can, encourage, a, sense, of, shared, identity, among, different, groups, within, a, society, and, facilitate, their, mobilisation, toward, a, common, cause, one, of, the, ways, that, populists, employ, the, understanding, of, the, people, is, in, the, idea, that, the, people, are, sovereign, that, in, a, democratic, state, governmental, decisions, should, rest, with, the, population, and, that, if, they, are, ignored, then, they, might, mobilise, or, revolt, this, is, the, sense, of, the, people, employed, in, the, late, 19th, century, united, states, by, the, people, s, party, and, which, has, also, been, used, by, later, populist, movements, in, that, country, a, second, way, in, which, the, people, is, conceived, by, populists, combines, a, socioeconomic, or, class, based, category, with, one, that, refers, to, certain, cultural, traditions, and, popular, values, the, concept, seeks, to, vindicate, the, dignity, of, a, social, group, who, regard, themselves, as, being, oppressed, by, a, dominant, elite, who, are, accused, of, treating, the, people, s, values, judgements, and, tastes, with, suspicion, or, contempt, a, third, use, of, the, people, by, populists, employs, it, as, a, synonym, for, the, nation, whether, that, national, community, be, conceived, in, either, ethnic, or, civic, terms, in, such, a, framework, all, individuals, regarded, as, being, native, to, a, particular, state, either, by, birth, or, by, ethnicity, could, be, considered, part, of, the, people, left, and, right, populists, both, regard, representative, democracy, as, being, captivated, by, political, elites, and, powerful, interest, groups, however, populists, of, the, right, tend, to, express, envy, for, those, low, on, the, social, ladder, identifying, special, interests, with, ethnic, or, other, minorities, progressive, populists, on, the, other, hand, envy, those, high, on, the, social, ladder, identifying, special, interests, with, powerful, groups, such, as, large, corporations, political, scientist, tjitske, akkerman, populism, typically, entails, celebrating, them, as, the, people, in, stanley, s, words, the, political, scientist, paul, taggart, proposed, the, term, the, heartland, to, better, reflect, what, populists, often, mean, in, their, rhetoric, according, to, taggart, the, heartland, was, the, place, in, which, in, the, populist, imagination, a, virtuous, and, unified, population, resides, who, this, heartland, is, can, vary, between, populists, even, within, the, same, country, for, instance, in, britain, the, centre, right, conservative, party, conceived, of, middle, england, as, its, heartland, while, the, far, right, british, national, party, conceived, of, the, native, british, people, as, its, heartland, mudde, noted, that, for, populists, the, people, are, neither, real, nor, all, inclusive, but, are, in, fact, a, mythical, and, constructed, sub, set, of, the, whole, population, they, are, an, imagined, community, much, like, the, imagined, communities, embraced, and, promoted, by, nationalists, populism, often, entails, presenting, the, people, as, the, underdog, populists, typically, seek, to, reveal, to, the, people, how, they, are, oppressed, in, doing, so, they, do, not, seek, to, change, the, people, but, rather, seek, to, preserve, the, latter, s, way, of, life, as, it, presently, exists, regarding, it, as, a, source, of, good, for, populists, the, way, of, life, of, the, people, is, presented, as, being, rooted, in, history, and, tradition, and, regarded, as, being, conducive, to, public, good, although, populist, leaders, often, present, themselves, as, representatives, of, the, people, they, often, come, from, elite, strata, in, society, examples, like, berlusconi, fortuyn, and, haider, were, all, well, connected, to, their, country, s, political, and, economic, elites, populism, can, also, be, subdivided, into, inclusionary, and, exclusionary, forms, which, differ, in, their, conceptions, of, who, the, people, are, inclusionary, populism, tends, to, define, the, people, more, broadly, accepting, and, advocating, for, minority, and, marginalised, groups, while, exclusionary, populism, defines, the, people, in, a, much, stricter, sense, generally, being, focused, on, a, particular, sociocultural, group, and, antagonistic, against, minority, groups, however, this, is, not, exactly, a, pure, dichotomy, exclusive, populists, can, still, give, voice, to, those, who, feel, marginalised, by, the, political, status, quo, and, include, minorities, if, it, is, advantageous, while, inclusive, populists, can, vary, significantly, in, how, inclusive, they, actually, are, in, addition, all, populisms, are, implicitly, exclusionary, since, they, define, the, people, against, the, elite, thus, some, scholars, argue, that, the, difference, between, populisms, is, not, whether, a, particular, populism, excludes, but, whom, it, excludes, from, its, conception, of, the, people, anti, elitism, is, widely, considered, the, central, characteristic, feature, of, populism, although, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, argued, that, anti, elitism, alone, was, not, evidence, of, populism, rather, according, to, stanley, in, populist, discourse, the, fundamental, distinguishing, feature, of, the, elite, is, that, it, is, in, an, adversarial, relationship, with, the, people, in, defining, the, elite, populists, often, condemn, not, only, the, political, establishment, but, also, the, economic, elite, cultural, elite, academic, elite, and, the, media, elite, which, they, present, as, one, homogeneous, corrupt, group, in, early, 21st, century, india, the, populist, bharatiya, janata, party, for, instance, accused, the, dominant, indian, national, congress, party, the, communist, party, of, india, ngos, academia, and, the, english, language, media, of, all, being, part, of, the, elite, when, operating, in, liberal, democracies, populists, often, condemn, dominant, political, parties, as, part, of, the, elite, but, at, the, same, time, do, not, reject, the, party, political, system, altogether, instead, either, calling, for, or, claiming, to, be, a, new, kind, of, party, different, from, the, others, although, condemning, almost, all, those, in, positions, of, power, within, a, given, society, populists, often, exclude, both, themselves, and, those, sympathetic, to, their, cause, even, when, they, too, are, in, positions, of, power, for, instance, the, freedom, party, of, austria, fp, a, right, wing, populist, group, regularly, condemned, the, media, in, austria, for, defending, the, elite, but, excluded, from, that, the, kronen, zeitung, a, widely, read, tabloid, that, supported, the, fp, and, its, leader, j, rg, haider, when, populists, take, governmental, power, they, are, faced, with, a, challenge, in, that, they, now, represent, a, new, elite, in, such, cases, like, ch, vez, in, venezuela, and, vladim, r, me, iar, in, slovakia, populists, retain, their, anti, establishment, rhetoric, by, making, changes, to, their, concept, of, the, elite, to, suit, their, new, circumstances, alleging, that, real, power, is, not, held, by, the, government, but, other, powerful, forces, who, continue, to, undermine, the, populist, government, and, the, will, of, the, people, itself, in, these, instances, populist, governments, often, conceptualise, the, elite, as, those, holding, economic, power, in, venezuela, for, example, ch, vez, blamed, the, economic, elite, for, frustrating, his, reforms, while, in, greece, the, left, wing, populist, prime, minister, alexis, tsipras, accused, the, lobbyists, and, oligarchs, of, greece, of, undermining, his, administration, in, populist, instances, like, these, the, claims, made, have, some, basis, in, reality, as, business, interests, seek, to, undermine, leftist, oriented, economic, reform, although, left, wing, populists, who, combine, populist, ideas, with, forms, of, socialism, most, commonly, present, the, elite, in, economic, terms, the, same, strategy, is, also, employed, by, some, right, wing, populists, in, the, united, states, during, the, late, 2000s, the, tea, party, movement, which, presented, itself, as, a, defender, of, the, capitalist, free, market, argued, that, big, business, and, its, allies, in, congress, seeks, to, undermine, the, free, market, and, kill, competition, by, stifling, small, business, among, some, 21st, century, right, wing, populists, the, elite, are, presented, as, being, left, wing, radicals, committed, to, political, correctness, the, dutch, right, wing, populist, leader, pim, fortuyn, referred, to, this, as, the, church, of, the, left, in, some, instances, particularly, in, latin, america, and, africa, the, elites, are, conceived, not, just, in, economic, but, also, in, ethnic, terms, representing, what, political, scientists, have, termed, ethnopopulism, in, bolivia, for, example, the, left, wing, populist, leader, evo, morales, juxtaposed, the, mestizo, and, indigenous, people, against, an, overwhelmingly, european, elite, declaring, that, we, indians, are, latin, america, s, moral, reserve, in, the, bolivian, case, this, was, not, accompanied, by, a, racially, exclusionary, approach, but, with, an, attempt, to, build, a, pan, ethnic, coalition, which, included, european, bolivians, against, the, largely, european, bolivian, elite, in, south, africa, the, populist, julius, malema, has, presented, black, south, africans, as, the, people, whom, he, claims, to, represent, calling, for, the, expropriation, of, land, owned, by, the, white, minority, without, compensation, in, areas, like, europe, where, nation, states, are, more, ethnically, homogeneous, this, ethnopopulist, approach, is, rare, given, that, the, people, and, elite, are, typically, of, the, same, ethnicity, for, some, populist, leaders, and, movements, the, term, the, elite, also, refers, to, an, academic, or, intellectual, establishment, and, as, such, entails, scholars, intellectuals, experts, or, organized, science, as, a, whole, such, leaders, and, movements, may, criticise, scientific, knowledge, as, abstract, useless, and, ideologically, biased, and, instead, demand, common, sense, experiential, knowledge, and, practical, solutions, to, be, true, knowledge, in, various, instances, populists, claim, that, the, elite, is, working, against, the, interests, of, the, country, in, the, european, union, eu, for, instance, various, populist, groups, allege, that, their, national, political, elites, put, the, interests, of, the, eu, itself, over, those, of, their, own, nation, states, similarly, in, latin, america, populists, often, charge, political, elites, with, championing, the, interests, of, the, united, states, over, those, of, their, own, countries, another, common, tactic, among, populists, particularly, in, europe, is, the, accusation, that, the, elites, place, the, interests, of, immigrants, above, those, of, the, native, population, the, zambian, populist, michael, sata, for, instance, adopted, a, xenophobic, stance, during, his, campaigns, by, focusing, his, criticism, on, the, country, s, asian, minority, decrying, chinese, and, indian, ownership, of, businesses, and, mines, in, india, the, right, wing, populist, leader, narendra, modi, rallied, supporters, against, muslim, bangladeshi, migrants, promising, to, deport, them, in, instances, where, populists, are, also, antisemitic, such, as, jobbik, in, hungary, and, attack, in, bulgaria, the, elites, are, accused, of, favouring, israeli, and, wider, jewish, interests, above, those, of, the, national, group, antisemitic, populists, often, accuse, the, elite, of, being, made, up, of, many, jews, as, well, when, populists, emphasise, ethnicity, as, part, of, their, discourse, the, elite, can, sometimes, be, presented, as, ethnic, traitors, a, third, component, of, the, ideational, approach, to, populism, is, the, idea, of, the, general, will, or, volont, g, n, rale, an, example, of, this, populist, understanding, of, the, general, will, can, be, seen, in, ch, vez, s, 2007, inaugural, address, when, he, stated, that, all, individuals, are, subject, to, error, and, seduction, but, not, the, people, which, possesses, to, an, eminent, degree, of, consciousness, of, its, own, good, and, the, measure, of, its, independence, because, of, that, its, judgement, is, pure, its, will, is, strong, and, none, can, corrupt, or, even, threaten, it, for, populists, the, general, will, of, the, people, is, something, that, should, take, precedence, over, the, preferences, of, the, elite, as, noted, by, stanley, the, populist, idea, of, the, general, will, is, connected, to, ideas, of, majoritarianism, and, authenticity, highlighting, how, populists, appeal, to, the, ideals, of, authenticity, and, ordinariness, he, noted, that, what, was, most, important, to, populists, was, to, appeal, to, the, idea, of, an, authentic, people, and, to, cultivate, the, idea, that, they, are, the, genuine, representatives, of, the, people, in, doing, so, they, often, emphasise, their, physical, proximity, to, the, people, and, their, distance, from, the, elites, sheri, berman, notes, that, while, populists, often, engage, in, democratic, rhetoric, they, frequently, ignore, or, devalue, norms, of, liberal, democracy, such, as, freedom, of, speech, freedom, of, the, press, legitimate, opposition, separation, of, powers, and, constraints, on, presidential, power, in, emphasising, the, general, will, many, populists, share, the, critique, of, representative, democratic, government, previously, espoused, by, the, french, philosopher, jean, jacques, rousseau, this, approach, regards, representative, governance, as, an, aristocratic, and, elitist, system, in, which, a, country, s, citizens, are, regarded, as, passive, entities, rather, than, choosing, laws, for, themselves, these, citizens, are, only, mobilised, for, elections, in, which, their, only, option, is, to, select, their, representatives, rather, than, taking, a, more, direct, role, in, legislation, and, governance, populists, often, favour, the, use, of, direct, democratic, measures, such, as, referendums, and, plebiscites, for, this, reason, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, suggested, that, it, can, be, argued, that, an, elective, affinity, exists, between, populism, and, direct, democracy, although, stanley, cautioned, that, support, for, direct, democracy, is, not, an, essential, attribute, of, populism, populist, notions, of, the, general, will, and, its, links, with, populist, leaders, are, usually, based, on, the, idea, of, common, sense, stanley, noted, that, rather, than, being, restricted, purely, to, populists, appeals, to, the, people, had, become, an, unavoidable, aspect, of, modern, political, practice, with, elections, and, referendums, predicated, on, the, notion, that, the, people, decide, the, outcome, thus, a, critique, of, the, ideational, definition, of, populism, is, that, it, becomes, too, broad, and, can, potentially, apply, to, all, political, actors, and, movements, responding, to, this, critique, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, argued, that, the, ideational, definition, did, allow, for, a, non, populism, in, the, form, of, both, elitism, and, pluralism, elitists, share, the, populist, binary, division, but, reverse, the, associations, whereas, populists, regard, the, elites, as, bad, and, the, common, people, as, good, elitists, view, the, people, as, being, vulgar, immoral, and, dangerous, and, the, elites, as, being, morally, culturally, and, intellectually, superior, elitists, want, politics, to, be, largely, or, entirely, an, elite, affair, some, such, as, spain, s, francisco, franco, and, chile, s, augusto, pinochet, reject, democracy, altogether, while, others, like, spain, s, jos, ortega, y, gasset, and, austria, s, joseph, schumpeter, support, a, limited, model, of, democracy, pluralism, differs, from, both, elitism, and, populism, by, rejecting, any, dualist, framework, instead, viewing, society, as, a, broad, array, of, overlapping, social, groups, each, with, their, own, ideas, and, interests, pluralists, argue, that, political, power, should, not, be, held, by, any, single, group, whether, defined, by, their, gender, ethnicity, economic, status, or, political, party, membership, and, should, instead, be, distributed, pluralists, encourage, governance, through, compromise, and, consensus, in, order, to, reflect, the, interests, of, as, many, of, these, groups, as, possible, unlike, populists, pluralists, do, not, believe, that, such, a, thing, as, a, general, will, exists, some, politicians, do, not, seek, to, demonise, a, social, elite, for, many, conservatives, for, example, the, social, elite, are, regarded, as, the, bulwark, of, the, traditional, social, order, while, for, some, liberals, the, social, elite, are, perceived, as, an, enlightened, legislative, and, administrative, cadre, the, popular, agency, definition, to, populism, uses, the, term, in, reference, to, a, democratic, way, of, life, that, is, built, on, the, popular, engagement, of, the, population, in, political, activity, in, this, understanding, populism, is, usually, perceived, as, a, positive, factor, in, the, mobilisation, of, the, populace, to, develop, a, communitarian, form, of, democracy, this, approach, to, the, term, is, common, among, historians, in, the, united, states, and, those, who, have, studied, the, late, 19th, century, people, s, party, the, laclauan, definition, of, populism, so, called, after, the, argentinian, political, theorist, ernesto, laclau, who, developed, it, uses, the, term, in, reference, to, what, proponents, regard, as, an, emancipatory, force, that, is, the, essence, of, politics, in, this, concept, of, populism, it, is, believed, to, mobilise, excluded, sectors, of, society, against, dominant, elites, and, changing, the, status, quo, laclau, s, initial, emphasis, was, on, class, antagonisms, arising, between, different, classes, although, he, later, altered, his, perspective, to, claim, that, populist, discourses, could, arise, from, any, part, of, the, socio, institutional, structure, for, laclau, socialism, was, the, highest, form, of, populism, his, understandings, of, the, topic, derived, in, large, part, from, his, focus, on, politics, in, latin, america, this, definition, is, popular, among, critics, of, liberal, democracy, and, is, widely, used, in, critical, studies, and, in, studies, of, west, european, and, latin, american, politics, harry, c, boyte, for, example, defined, populism, as, a, politics, of, civic, agency, which, develops, the, power, of, the, people, to, shape, their, destiny, as, examples, citing, both, the, russian, narodniks, and, the, south, african, black, consciousness, movement, the, socioeconomic, definition, of, populism, applies, the, term, to, what, it, regards, as, an, irresponsible, form, of, economic, policy, by, which, a, government, engages, in, a, period, of, massive, public, spending, financed, by, foreign, loans, after, which, the, country, falls, into, hyperinflation, and, harsh, economic, adjustments, are, then, imposed, this, use, of, the, term, was, used, by, economists, like, rudiger, dornbusch, and, jeffrey, sachs, and, was, particularly, popular, among, scholars, of, latin, america, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, since, that, time, this, definition, continued, to, be, used, by, some, economists, and, journalists, particularly, in, the, us, but, was, uncommon, among, other, social, sciences, this, definition, relies, on, focusing, on, socialist, and, other, left, wing, forms, of, populism, it, does, not, apply, to, other, groups, commonly, understood, as, populist, which, adopted, right, wing, stances, on, economic, issues, an, additional, framework, has, been, described, as, the, political, strategic, approach, this, applies, the, term, populism, to, a, political, strategy, in, which, a, charismatic, leader, seeks, to, govern, based, on, direct, and, unmediated, connection, with, their, followers, kurt, weyland, defined, this, conception, of, populism, as, a, political, strategy, through, which, a, personalist, leader, seeks, or, exercises, government, power, based, on, direct, unmediated, uninstitutionalized, support, from, large, numbers, of, mostly, unorganized, followers, this, is, a, definition, of, the, term, that, is, popular, among, scholars, of, non, western, societies, by, focusing, on, leadership, this, concept, of, populism, does, not, allow, for, the, existence, of, populist, parties, or, populist, social, movements, under, this, definition, for, instance, the, us, people, s, party, which, first, invented, the, term, populism, could, not, be, considered, populist, mudde, suggested, that, although, the, idea, of, a, leader, having, direct, access, to, the, people, was, a, common, element, among, populists, it, is, best, regarded, as, a, feature, which, facilitates, rather, than, defines, populism, in, popular, discourse, populism, is, sometimes, used, in, a, negative, sense, in, reference, to, politics, which, involves, promoting, extremely, simple, solutions, to, complex, problems, in, a, highly, emotional, manner, mudde, suggested, that, this, definition, seems, to, have, instinctive, value, but, was, difficult, to, employ, empirically, because, almost, all, political, groups, engage, in, sloganeering, and, because, it, can, be, difficult, to, differentiate, an, argument, made, emotionally, from, one, made, rationally, mudde, thought, that, this, phenomenon, was, better, termed, demagogy, rather, than, populism, another, use, of, the, term, in, popular, discourse, is, to, describe, opportunistic, policies, designed, to, quickly, please, voters, rather, than, deciding, a, more, rational, course, of, action, examples, of, this, would, include, a, governing, political, party, lowering, taxes, before, an, election, or, promising, to, provide, things, to, the, electorate, which, the, state, cannot, afford, to, pay, for, mudde, suggested, that, this, phenomenon, is, better, described, as, opportunism, rather, than, populism, another, way, of, defining, populism, is, by, defining, it, as, a, political, style, moffitt, states, that, political, style, can, be, defined, as, the, repertoires, of, embodied, symbolically, mediated, performance, made, to, audiences, that, are, used, to, create, and, navigate, the, fields, of, power, that, comprise, the, political, stretching, from, the, domain, of, government, through, to, everyday, life, this, definition, acknowledges, that, populism, includes, both, rhetorical, aspects, such, as, gestures, and, body, language, spoken, language, argumentation, while, also, acknowledging, that, populism, includes, aesthetic, aspects, such, as, fashion, self, presentation, images, and, designs, this, definition, also, acknowledges, that, political, performances, are, constructed, moffitt, argues, that, an, ideational, approach, doesn, t, include, the, emphasis, of, performative, elements, while, political, style, does, in, addition, populism, cannot, be, considered, an, ideology, because, it, doesn, t, consist, of, specific, ideas, or, ideals, related, to, economic, or, political, theory, and, policy, populism, as, a, political, style, is, only, concerned, with, the, way, that, political, ideas, are, presented, and, preformed, according, to, moffitt, this, is, why, populism, can, appear, across, a, number, of, different, ideological, spectrums, on, the, left, and, right, populism, has, no, political, ideology, it, is, only, a, political, style, moffitt, notes, that, populism, as, a, political, style, has, certain, features, which, define, it, the, first, of, these, features, is, the, people, versus, the, elite, moffitt, acknowledges, that, the, dichotomic, division, of, society, between, the, people, and, the, elite, is, one, of, the, most, popular, definitions, of, populism, but, is, only, one, of, the, features, of, populism, as, a, political, style, the, second, feature, of, populism, as, a, political, style, is, the, use, of, bad, manners, bad, manners, consists, of, slang, swearing, political, incorrectness, and, being, over, demonstrative, and, colorful, as, opposed, to, the, high, behaviors, of, rigidness, rationality, composure, and, use, of, technocratic, language, the, third, feature, of, populism, as, a, political, style, is, crisis, breakdown, or, threat, this, is, the, exigence, that, populists, use, moffitt, writes, that, crises, are, often, related, to, the, breakdown, between, citizens, and, their, representatives, but, can, also, be, related, to, immigration, economic, difficulties, perceived, injustice, military, threat, social, change, or, other, issues, this, performance, relates, to, a, distrust, of, deliberation, negotiation, consultations, reviews, reports, and, the, complicated, nature, of, designing, policy, solutions, there, are, multiple, implications, for, populism, being, understood, as, a, political, style, the, first, implication, that, moffitt, points, out, is, that, populism, as, a, political, style, allows, people, to, understand, why, populism, doesn, t, adhere, to, the, common, left, right, ideological, spectrum, populism, is, not, a, political, ideology, it, is, just, a, way, to, present, ideas, through, both, rhetorical, and, aesthetic, aspects, in, addition, populism, as, a, political, style, means, that, populism, no, longer, has, to, be, conceptualized, as, a, binary, category, but, can, instead, be, conceptualized, as, a, gradational, concept, this, means, that, populist, actors, can, depending, on, the, time, be, more, or, less, populist, however, this, means, that, there, has, to, be, an, opposite, political, style, to, populism, moffitt, notes, that, the, opposing, political, style, to, populism, is, a, technocratic, political, style, in, contrast, with, appeal, to, the, people, vs, the, elite, bad, manners, and, the, exigence, of, a, crisis, breakdown, threat, the, technocratic, political, style, emphasizes, appeal, to, expertise, good, manners, and, stability, and, progress, this, distinction, between, these, two, political, styles, allows, political, actors, to, be, plotted, on, a, scale, rather, than, being, seen, as, populist, or, not, it, also, allows, for, the, scale, to, be, adjusted, in, relation, to, different, political, elections, in, different, years, due, to, the, fact, that, populists, might, not, always, utilize, the, populist, political, style, to, the, same, extent, as, they, did, in, years, prior, one, area, of, debate, in, explaining, populism, is, whether, its, main, cause, is, based, in, the, needs, of, citizens, demand, side, explanations, or, in, the, failures, of, governments, supply, side, explanations, in, focusing, on, the, changing, grievances, or, demands, of, citizens, demand, side, explanations, can, be, seen, as, bottom, up, explanations, while, supply, side, explanations, in, focusing, on, political, actors, and, institutions, can, be, seen, as, top, down, explanations, various, demand, side, factors, have, been, claimed, to, make, it, more, likely, that, individuals, will, support, populist, ideas, economists, and, political, economists, often, emphasize, the, importance, of, economic, concerns, while, political, scientists, and, sociologists, often, emphasize, sociocultural, concerns, in, their, analysis, of, demand, side, factors, the, economic, grievance, thesis, argues, that, economic, factors, such, as, deindustrialisation, economic, liberalisation, and, deregulation, are, causing, the, formation, of, a, left, behind, precariat, with, low, job, security, high, inequality, and, wage, stagnation, who, then, support, populism, some, theories, only, focus, on, the, effect, of, economic, crises, or, inequality, another, objection, for, economic, reasons, is, due, to, the, globalization, that, is, taking, place, in, the, world, today, in, addition, to, criticism, of, the, widening, inequality, caused, by, the, elite, the, widening, inequality, among, the, general, public, caused, by, the, influx, of, immigrants, and, other, factors, due, to, globalization, is, also, a, target, of, populist, criticism, the, evidence, of, increasing, economic, disparity, and, volatility, of, family, incomes, is, clear, particularly, in, the, united, states, as, shown, by, the, work, of, thomas, piketty, and, others, commentators, such, as, martin, wolf, emphasize, the, importance, of, economics, they, warn, that, such, trends, increase, resentment, and, make, people, susceptible, to, populist, rhetoric, evidence, for, this, is, mixed, at, the, macro, level, political, scientists, report, that, xenophobia, anti, immigrant, ideas, and, resentment, towards, out, groups, tend, to, be, higher, during, difficult, economic, times, economic, crises, have, been, associated, with, gains, by, far, right, political, parties, however, there, is, little, evidence, at, the, micro, or, individual, level, to, link, individual, economic, grievances, and, populist, support, populist, politicians, tend, to, put, pressure, on, central, bank, independence, the, modernisation, losers, theory, argues, that, certain, aspects, of, transition, to, modernity, have, caused, demand, for, populism, some, arguments, rely, on, the, belief, that, anomie, has, followed, industrialisation, and, resulted, in, dissolution, fragmentation, and, differentiation, weakening, the, traditional, ties, of, civil, society, and, increasing, individualization, populism, offers, a, broad, identity, which, gives, sovereignty, to, the, previously, marginalized, masses, as, the, people, however, empirical, studies, suggest, that, supporters, of, radical, right, wing, populism, occur, across, the, social, spectrum, and, are, not, more, likely, to, appear, in, groups, defined, as, modernisation, losers, other, theories, argue, that, grievances, have, a, primarily, sociocultural, rather, than, an, economic, basis, for, example, the, cultural, backlash, thesis, argues, that, right, wing, populism, is, reaction, to, the, rise, of, postmaterialism, in, many, developed, countries, including, the, spread, of, feminism, multiculturalism, and, environmentalism, according, to, this, view, the, spread, of, ideas, and, values, through, a, society, challenges, accepted, norms, until, society, reaches, a, tipping, point, which, causes, a, reaction, in, this, case, support, for, right, wing, populism, some, theories, limit, this, argument, to, being, a, reaction, to, just, the, increase, of, ethnic, diversity, from, immigration, such, theories, are, particularly, popular, with, sociologists, and, with, political, scientists, studying, industrial, world, and, american, politics, the, empiric, studies, testing, this, theory, have, produced, highly, contradicting, results, at, the, micro, or, individual, level, there, are, strong, connections, between, individual, positions, on, sociocultural, issues, such, as, immigration, policy, and, racial, animus, and, right, wing, populist, voting, however, at, the, macro, level, studies, have, not, shown, clear, relationships, between, measures, of, populist, sentiment, in, countries, and, actual, right, wing, party, support, however, there, is, strong, evidence, from, political, scientists, and, political, psychologists, documenting, the, influence, of, group, based, identity, threats, on, voters, those, who, identify, as, part, of, a, group, and, perceive, it, as, being, under, threat, are, likely, to, support, political, actors, who, promise, to, protect, the, status, and, identity, of, their, group, while, such, research, often, focuses, on, white, identity, results, apply, broadly, to, other, social, groups, that, perceive, themselves, to, be, under, threat, the, length, of, time, since, a, country, has, been, democratized, has, also, been, linked, to, its, potential, for, populist, success, this, is, claimed, to, be, because, younger, democracies, have, less, established, political, parties, and, weaker, liberal, democratic, norms, for, example, populist, success, in, eastern, europe, has, been, linked, to, the, legacy, of, communism, however, this, explanation, suffers, from, the, lack, of, success, of, populism, in, most, post, communist, countries, supply, side, explanations, focus, on, political, actors, and, institutions, and, the, ways, in, which, governments, may, fail, to, respond, to, the, changing, conditions, that, affect, citizens, economic, social, and, other, structural, trends, are, seen, as, being, modified, by, institutions, as, they, determine, political, outcomes, in, this, view, citizens, turn, to, populism, when, governments, do, not, respond, effectively, to, the, challenges, they, and, their, citizens, face, research, supports, the, idea, that, populism, is, more, likely, to, thrive, when, mainstream, parties, on, the, center, left, and, center, right, do, not, address, important, contemporary, issues, and, do, not, offer, clear, alternatives, to, voters, coalitions, that, blur, distinctions, on, positions, are, also, likely, to, increase, populism, economic, and, or, social, changes, alone, are, not, problems, they, only, cause, citizens, to, become, angry, resentful, and, susceptible, to, the, appeal, of, populists, if, established, mainstream, politicians, parties, and, governments, fail, to, recognize, and, respond, to, them, sheri, berman, in, political, order, in, changing, societies, 1968, samuel, p, huntington, argues, that, rapid, change, social, or, economic, in, a, society, will, increase, the, demands, of, its, citizens, unless, political, institutions, are, responsive, and, effective, they, are, unlikely, to, respond, to, and, satisfy, such, demands, if, political, systems, are, weak, or, have, become, unresponsive, over, time, then, dissatisfaction, political, disorder, and, even, violence, become, more, likely, political, institutions, that, do, not, respond, to, social, and, economic, changes, are, likely, to, fail, responsive, political, systems, can, adapt, to, more, severe, challenges, than, unresponsive, ones, huntington, s, ideas, grew, out, of, work, on, third, world, countries, but, are, also, applicable, to, advanced, industrial, countries, in, a, supply, side, view, of, american, politics, populism, can, be, seen, as, a, symptom, of, institutional, decay, it, can, be, suggested, that, political, factors, such, as, gerrymandering, the, electoral, college, special, interest, lobbying, and, dark, money, are, distorting, political, and, economic, debate, and, decreasing, the, ability, of, the, government, to, respond, to, the, concerns, of, large, numbers, of, citizens, this, in, turn, generates, dissatisfaction, which, may, increase, the, likelihood, that, citizens, will, support, populism, scholars, studying, the, european, union, have, suggested, that, european, integration, may, have, had, the, undesired, effect, of, decreasing, the, system, s, responsiveness, to, voters, as, law, and, policy, making, increasingly, became, the, responsibility, of, the, european, union, this, too, may, have, increased, support, for, populism, institutions, such, as, the, european, central, bank, may, also, distance, decision, making, from, electoral, power, it, has, been, argued, that, political, parties, themselves, have, become, disconnected, from, society, and, unable, to, respond, to, citizen, s, concerns, another, underlying, debate, in, discussions, of, populism, is, the, comparison, of, structural, and, voluntarist, approaches, voluntarist, or, agency, based, explanations, focus, on, the, behaviors, of, politicians, and, parties, including, populists, themselves, an, important, area, of, research, is, the, examination, of, how, parties, develop, and, how, responses, to, new, parties, shape, them, successful, politicians, and, parties, shape, the, formation, of, agendas, identifying, and, increasing, the, salience, of, issues, which, they, believe, will, benefit, them, established, parties, may, adopt, various, strategies, when, a, new, party, appears, dismissive, adversarial, or, accommodative, a, dismissive, strategy, such, as, ignoring, a, party, and, its, issue, s, can, only, be, effective, if, the, issue, involved, is, unimportant, or, short, lived, otherwise, dismissing, an, issue, leaves, ownership, of, the, issue, with, the, new, party, and, allows, them, to, attract, any, voters, who, see, the, issue, as, important, in, an, adversarial, response, a, mainstream, party, directly, engages, over, an, issue, emphasizing, their, opposition, to, the, new, party, s, position, this, increases, the, issue, s, visibility, makes, it, a, focus, of, ongoing, political, debate, and, can, reinforce, the, new, party, s, ownership, of, it, an, adversarial, response, can, be, to, the, benefit, of, a, mainstream, party, if, most, voters, or, at, least, the, mainstream, party, s, voters, disagree, with, the, new, party, s, position, and, are, unlikely, to, ally, with, it, as, a, result, an, accommodative, strategy, is, to, move, the, mainstream, party, closer, to, the, position, advocated, by, the, new, party, in, hopes, of, retaining, voters, who, care, about, the, issue, this, works, best, if, adopted, early, before, a, new, party, is, heavily, identified, with, an, issue, if, an, issue, is, important, long, lived, and, of, strong, interest, to, its, supporters, a, mainstream, party, can, benefit, from, quickly, shifting, its, position, to, one, closer, to, the, new, party, similarly, a, populist, party, with, neo, fascist, or, antidemocratic, roots, may, be, able, to, increase, its, support, by, moderating, its, views, to, a, milder, form, of, its, original, position, e, g, from, neofascist, to, xenophobic, right, wing, populists, are, more, effective, in, mobilizing, voters, around, issues, when, mainstream, parties, ignore, the, issue, or, offer, alternatives, that, are, not, aligned, with, voter, opinions, they, are, also, more, likely, to, benefit, from, emphasizing, social, and, cultural, issues, such, as, immigration, and, race, appealing, to, voters, who, are, positioned, economically, towards, the, left, wing, but, hold, socially, conservative, views, there, are, three, forms, of, political, mobilisation, which, populists, have, adopted, that, of, the, populist, leader, the, populist, political, party, and, the, populist, social, movement, the, reasons, why, voters, are, attracted, to, populists, differ, but, common, catalysts, for, the, rise, of, populists, include, dramatic, economic, decline, or, a, systematic, corruption, scandal, that, damages, established, political, parties, for, instance, the, great, recession, of, 2007, and, its, impact, on, the, economies, of, southern, europe, was, a, catalyst, for, the, rise, of, syriza, in, greece, and, podemos, in, spain, while, the, mani, pulite, corruption, scandal, of, the, early, 1990s, played, a, significant, part, in, the, rise, of, the, italian, populist, silvio, berlusconi, another, catalyst, for, the, growth, of, populism, is, a, widespread, perception, among, voters, that, the, political, system, is, unresponsive, to, them, this, can, arise, when, elected, governments, introduce, policies, that, are, unpopular, with, their, voters, but, which, are, implemented, because, they, are, considered, to, be, responsible, or, imposed, by, supranational, organisations, in, latin, america, for, example, many, countries, passed, unpopular, economic, reforms, under, pressure, from, the, international, monetary, fund, and, world, bank, while, in, europe, many, countries, in, the, european, union, were, pushed, to, implement, unpopular, economic, austerity, measures, by, the, union, s, authorities, decentralisation, of, political, power, is, a, very, useful, tool, for, populists, to, use, to, their, benefit, this, is, because, it, allows, them, to, speak, more, directly, to, the, people, of, whom, they, seek, to, gain, attention, and, votes, populism, is, often, associated, with, charismatic, and, dominant, leaders, and, the, populist, leader, is, according, to, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, the, quintessential, form, of, populist, mobilization, these, individuals, campaign, and, attract, support, on, the, basis, of, their, own, personal, appeal, their, supporters, then, develop, a, perceived, personal, connection, with, the, leader, for, these, leaders, populist, rhetoric, allows, them, to, claim, that, they, have, a, direct, relationship, with, the, people, and, in, many, cases, they, claim, to, be, a, personification, of, the, people, themselves, presenting, themselves, as, the, vox, populi, or, voice, of, the, people, hugo, ch, vez, for, instance, stated, i, demand, absolute, loyalty, to, me, i, am, not, an, individual, i, am, the, people, populist, leaders, can, also, present, themselves, as, the, saviour, of, the, people, because, of, their, perceived, unique, talents, and, vision, and, in, doing, so, can, claim, to, be, making, personal, sacrifices, for, the, good, of, the, people, because, loyalty, to, the, populist, leader, is, thus, seen, as, representing, loyalty, to, the, people, those, who, oppose, the, leader, can, be, branded, enemies, of, the, people, the, overwhelming, majority, of, populist, leaders, have, been, men, although, there, have, been, various, females, occupying, this, role, most, of, these, female, populist, leaders, gained, positions, of, seniority, through, their, connections, to, previously, dominant, men, eva, per, n, was, the, wife, of, juan, per, n, marine, le, pen, the, daughter, of, jean, marie, le, pen, keiko, fujimori, the, daughter, of, alberto, fujimori, and, yingluck, shinawatra, the, sister, of, thaksin, shinawatra, canovan, noted, that, populists, often, used, colourful, and, undiplomatic, language, to, distinguish, themselves, from, the, governing, elite, in, africa, several, populist, leaders, have, distinguished, themselves, by, speaking, in, indigenous, languages, rather, than, either, french, or, english, populist, leaders, often, present, themselves, as, people, of, action, rather, than, people, of, words, talking, of, the, need, for, bold, action, and, common, sense, solutions, to, issues, which, they, call, crises, male, populist, leaders, often, express, themselves, using, simple, and, sometimes, vulgar, language, in, an, attempt, to, present, themselves, as, the, common, man, or, one, of, the, boys, to, add, to, their, populist, appeal, an, example, of, this, is, umberto, bossi, the, leader, of, the, right, wing, populist, italian, lega, nord, who, at, rallies, would, state, the, league, has, a, hard, on, while, putting, his, middle, finger, up, as, a, sign, of, disrespect, to, the, government, in, rome, another, recurring, feature, of, male, populist, leaders, is, the, emphasis, that, they, place, on, their, own, virility, an, example, of, this, is, the, italian, prime, minister, silvio, berlusconi, who, bragged, about, his, bunga, bunga, sex, parties, and, his, ability, to, seduce, young, women, among, female, populist, leaders, it, is, more, common, for, them, to, emphasise, their, role, as, a, wife, and, mother, the, us, right, wing, populist, sarah, palin, for, instance, referred, to, herself, as, a, hockey, mom, and, a, mama, grizzly, while, australian, right, wing, populist, pauline, hanson, stated, that, i, care, so, passionately, about, this, country, it, s, like, i, m, its, mother, australia, is, my, home, and, the, australian, people, are, my, children, populist, leaders, typically, portray, themselves, as, outsiders, who, are, separate, from, the, elite, female, populist, leaders, sometimes, reference, their, gender, as, setting, them, apart, from, the, dominant, old, boys, club, while, in, latin, america, a, number, of, populists, such, as, evo, morales, and, alberto, fujimori, emphasised, their, non, white, ethnic, background, to, set, them, apart, from, the, white, dominated, elite, other, populists, have, used, clothing, to, set, them, apart, in, south, africa, the, populist, julius, malema, and, members, of, his, economic, freedom, fighters, attended, parliament, dressed, as, miners, and, workers, to, distinguish, themselves, from, the, other, politicians, wearing, suits, in, instances, where, wealthy, business, figures, promote, populist, sentiments, such, as, ross, perot, thaksin, shinawatra, or, berlusconi, it, can, be, difficult, to, present, themselves, as, being, outside, the, elite, however, this, is, achieved, by, portraying, themselves, as, being, apart, from, the, political, if, not, the, economic, elite, and, portraying, themselves, as, reluctant, politicians, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, noted, that, in, reality, most, populist, leaders, are, very, much, part, of, the, national, elite, typically, being, highly, educated, upper, middle, class, middle, aged, males, from, the, majority, ethnicity, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, suggested, that, true, outsiders, to, the, political, system, are, rare, although, cited, instances, like, venezuela, s, ch, vez, and, peru, s, fujimori, more, common, is, that, they, are, insider, outsiders, strongly, connected, to, the, inner, circles, of, government, but, not, having, ever, been, part, of, it, the, dutch, right, wing, populist, geert, wilders, had, for, example, been, a, prominent, back, bench, mp, for, many, years, before, launching, his, populist, party, for, freedom, while, in, south, africa, malema, had, been, leader, of, the, governing, african, national, congress, anc, youth, league, until, he, was, expelled, at, which, he, launched, his, own, populist, movement, only, a, few, populist, leaders, are, insiders, individuals, who, have, held, leading, roles, in, government, prior, to, portraying, themselves, as, populists, one, example, is, thaksin, shinawatra, who, was, twice, deputy, prime, minister, of, thailand, before, launching, his, own, populist, political, party, another, is, rafael, correa, who, served, as, the, ecuadorean, finance, minister, before, launching, a, left, wing, populist, challenge, populist, leaders, are, sometimes, also, characterised, as, strongmen, or, in, latin, american, countries, as, caudillos, in, a, number, of, cases, such, as, argentina, s, per, n, or, venezuela, s, ch, vez, these, leaders, have, military, backgrounds, which, contribute, to, their, strongman, image, other, populist, leaders, have, also, evoked, the, strongman, image, without, having, a, military, background, these, include, italy, s, berlusconi, slovakia, s, me, iar, and, thailand, s, thaksin, shinawatra, populism, and, strongmen, are, not, intrinsically, connected, however, as, stressed, by, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, only, a, minority, of, strongmen, are, populists, and, only, a, minority, of, populists, is, a, strongman, rather, than, being, populists, many, strongmen, such, as, spain, s, francisco, franco, were, elitists, who, led, authoritarian, administrations, in, most, cases, these, populist, leaders, built, a, political, organisation, around, themselves, typically, a, political, party, although, in, many, instances, these, remain, dominated, by, the, leader, these, individuals, often, give, a, populist, movement, its, political, identity, as, is, seen, with, movements, like, fortuynism, in, the, netherlands, peronism, in, argentina, berlusconism, in, italy, and, chavismo, in, venezuela, populist, mobilisation, is, not, however, always, linked, to, a, charismatic, leadership, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, suggested, that, populist, personalist, leadership, was, more, common, in, countries, with, a, presidential, system, rather, than, a, parliamentary, one, because, these, allow, for, the, election, of, a, single, individual, to, the, role, of, head, of, government, without, the, need, for, an, accompanying, party, examples, where, a, populist, leader, has, been, elected, to, the, presidency, without, an, accompanying, political, party, have, included, peron, in, argentina, fujimori, in, peru, and, correa, in, ecuador, a, subset, of, populism, which, deals, with, the, use, of, media, by, politicians, is, called, media, populism, populist, leaders, often, use, the, media, in, order, to, mobilize, their, support, in, latin, america, there, is, a, long, tradition, of, using, mass, media, as, a, way, for, charismatic, leaders, to, directly, communicate, with, the, poorly, educated, masses, first, by, radio, and, then, by, television, the, former, venezuelan, president, hugo, ch, vez, had, a, weekly, show, called, al, presidente, which, according, to, historian, enrique, krauze, gave, some, venezuelans, at, least, the, appearance, of, contact, with, power, through, his, verbal, and, visual, presence, which, may, be, welcomed, by, people, who, have, spent, most, of, their, lives, being, ignored, the, media, has, also, been, argued, to, have, helped, populists, in, countries, of, other, regions, by, giving, exposure, to, the, most, controversial, politicians, for, commercial, reasons, donald, trump, was, claimed, to, have, received, 5, billion, worth, of, free, coverage, during, his, 2016, campaign, tabloids, are, often, stereotyped, as, presenting, a, platform, for, populist, politics, due, to, their, tendency, toward, melodrama, infotainment, and, conflict, and, thus, provide, support, for, populist, parties, examples, of, this, have, been, the, support, given, by, kronen, zeitung, to, the, austrian, freedom, party, and, the, berlusconi, owned, presses, support, for, italy, s, national, alliance, in, the, mid, 1990s, based, on, his, analysis, of, dutch, and, british, media, tjitske, akkerman, however, argued, that, tabloids, were, no, more, prone, to, populism, than, the, quality, press, in, the, 21st, century, populists, have, increasingly, used, social, media, to, bypass, the, mainstream, media, and, directly, approach, their, target, audiences, in, earlier, periods, before, radio, thought, mass, media, newspapers, tended, to, operate, more, like, social, media, than, modern, newspapers, publishing, local, gossip, and, with, little, fact, checking, the, expansion, of, newspapers, to, rural, areas, of, the, united, states, in, the, early, twentieth, century, increased, support, for, populist, parties, and, positions, it, has, been, claimed, that, while, traditional, media, acting, as, so, called, gatekeepers, filter, the, messages, that, they, broadcast, through, journalistic, norms, social, media, permits, a, direct, linkage, from, political, actors, to, potential, audiences, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, use, of, twitter, helped, donald, trump, win, the, us, presidency, while, the, same, has, been, claimed, regarding, the, use, of, youtube, by, the, jair, bolsonaro, 2018, presidential, campaign, political, systems, with, low, political, efficacy, or, high, wasted, votes, can, contribute, to, populism, populist, leaders, have, been, claimed, to, be, more, successful, in, presidential, systems, this, is, because, such, systems, give, advantage, to, charismatic, populist, leaders, especially, when, institutionalized, parties, are, weak, this, is, especially, the, case, in, two, round, systems, because, outsiders, who, might, not, win, most, votes, in, the, first, round, of, voting, might, be, able, to, do, so, when, faced, against, a, mainstream, candidate, in, the, second, round, this, has, been, claimed, to, be, evident, in, the, 1990, peruvian, general, election, won, by, alberto, fujimori, who, lost, on, the, first, round, furthermore, juan, jos, linz, has, argued, that, the, direct, relationship, between, the, president, and, the, electorate, fosters, a, populist, perception, of, the, president, as, representing, the, whole, people, and, their, opponents, as, resisting, the, popular, will, another, form, of, mobilisation, is, through, populist, political, parties, populists, are, not, generally, opposed, to, political, representation, but, merely, want, their, own, representatives, those, of, the, people, in, power, in, various, cases, non, populist, political, parties, have, transitioned, into, populist, ones, the, elitist, socialist, unity, party, of, germany, a, marxist, leninist, group, which, governed, east, germany, later, transitioned, after, german, re, unification, into, a, populist, party, the, left, in, other, instances, such, as, the, austrian, fp, and, swiss, svp, a, non, populist, party, can, have, a, populist, faction, which, later, takes, control, of, the, whole, party, in, some, examples, where, a, political, party, has, been, dominated, by, a, single, charismatic, leader, the, latter, s, death, has, served, to, unite, and, strengthen, the, party, as, with, argentina, s, justicialist, party, after, juan, per, n, s, death, in, 1974, or, the, united, socialist, party, of, venezuela, after, ch, vez, s, death, in, 2013, in, other, cases, a, populist, party, has, seen, one, strong, centralising, leader, replace, another, as, when, marine, le, pen, replaced, her, father, jean, marie, as, the, leader, of, the, national, front, in, 2011, or, when, heinz, christian, strache, took, over, from, haider, as, chair, of, the, freedom, party, of, austria, in, 2005, many, populist, parties, achieve, an, electoral, breakthrough, but, then, fail, to, gain, electoral, persistence, with, their, success, fading, away, at, subsequent, elections, in, various, cases, they, are, able, to, secure, regional, strongholds, of, support, but, with, little, support, elsewhere, in, the, country, the, alliance, for, the, future, of, austria, bz, for, instance, gained, national, representation, in, the, austrian, parliament, solely, because, of, its, strong, support, in, carinthia, similarly, the, belgian, vlaams, belang, party, has, its, stronghold, in, antwerp, while, the, swiss, people, s, party, has, its, stronghold, in, z, rich, an, additional, form, is, that, of, the, populist, social, movement, populist, social, movements, are, comparatively, rare, as, most, social, movements, focus, on, a, more, restricted, social, identity, or, issue, rather, than, identifying, with, the, people, more, broadly, however, after, the, great, recession, of, 2007, a, number, of, populist, social, movements, emerged, expressing, public, frustrations, with, national, and, international, economic, systems, these, included, the, occupy, movement, which, originated, in, the, us, and, used, the, slogan, we, are, the, 99, and, the, spanish, indignados, movement, which, employed, the, motto, real, democracy, now, we, are, not, goods, in, the, hands, of, politicians, and, bankers, few, populist, social, movements, survive, for, more, than, a, few, years, with, most, examples, like, the, occupy, movement, petering, out, after, their, initial, growth, in, some, cases, the, social, movement, fades, away, as, a, strong, leader, emerges, from, within, it, and, moves, into, electoral, politics, an, example, of, this, can, be, seen, with, the, india, against, corruption, social, movement, from, which, emerged, arvind, kejriwal, who, founded, the, aam, aadmi, party, common, man, party, another, is, the, spanish, indignados, movement, which, appeared, in, 2011, before, spawning, the, podemos, party, led, by, pablo, iglesias, turri, n, these, populist, social, movements, can, exert, a, broader, societal, impact, which, results, in, populist, politicians, emerging, to, prominence, the, tea, party, and, occupy, movements, that, appeared, in, the, us, during, the, late, 2000s, and, early, 2010s, have, been, seen, as, an, influence, on, the, rise, of, donald, trump, and, bernie, sanders, as, prominent, figures, in, the, mid, 2010s, some, populist, leaders, have, sought, to, broaden, their, support, by, creating, supporter, groups, within, the, country, chavez, for, instance, ordered, the, formation, of, bolivarian, circles, communal, councils, urban, land, committees, and, technical, water, roundtables, across, venezuela, these, could, improve, political, participation, among, poorer, sectors, of, venezuelan, society, although, also, served, as, networks, through, which, the, state, transferred, resources, to, those, neighbourhoods, which, produced, high, rates, of, support, for, chavez, government, populism, is, a, flexible, term, as, it, can, be, seen, to, exist, in, both, democracies, as, well, as, authoritarian, regimes, there, have, been, intense, debates, about, the, relationship, between, populism, and, democracy, some, regard, populism, as, being, an, intrinsic, danger, to, democracy, others, regard, it, as, the, only, true, form, of, democracy, populists, often, present, themselves, as, true, democrats, it, could, be, argued, that, populism, is, democratic, as, it, allows, voters, to, remove, governments, they, do, not, approve, via, the, ballot, box, because, voting, is, an, essential, value, for, a, state, to, be, considered, a, democracy, albertazzi, and, mcdonnell, stated, that, populism, and, democracy, were, inextricably, linked, the, political, scientist, manuel, anselmi, described, populism, as, being, deeply, connected, with, democracy, and, march, suggested, that, populism, represented, a, critique, of, democracy, not, an, alternative, to, it, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, write, that, in, a, world, that, is, dominated, by, democracy, and, liberalism, populism, has, essentially, become, an, illiberal, democratic, response, to, undemocratic, liberalism, adamidis, argues, that, the, effect, of, populism, on, democracy, can, be, measured, by, reference, to, its, impact, on, the, democratic, legal, systems, and, in, particular, to, the, changes, it, effects, on, their, rule, of, recognition, populism, can, serve, as, a, democratic, corrective, by, contributing, to, the, mobilisation, of, social, groups, who, feel, excluded, from, political, decision, making, it, can, also, raise, awareness, among, the, socio, political, elites, of, popular, concerns, in, society, even, if, it, makes, the, former, uncomfortable, when, some, populists, have, taken, power, most, notably, ch, vez, in, venezuela, they, have, enhanced, the, use, of, direct, democracy, through, the, regular, application, of, referendums, for, this, reason, some, democratic, politicians, have, argued, that, they, need, to, become, more, populist, ren, cuperus, of, the, dutch, labour, party, for, instance, called, for, social, democracy, to, become, more, populist, in, a, leftist, way, in, order, to, engage, with, voters, who, felt, left, behind, by, cultural, and, technological, change, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, argued, that, populism, is, essentially, democratic, but, at, odds, with, liberal, democracy, since, populism, is, based, on, putting, into, effect, the, will, of, the, people, it, is, therefore, majoritarian, in, nature, and, opposed, to, the, safeguarding, of, minority, rights, which, is, a, defining, feature, of, liberal, democracy, populism, also, undermines, the, tenets, of, liberal, democracy, by, rejecting, notions, of, pluralism, and, the, idea, that, anything, including, constitutional, limits, should, constrain, the, general, will, of, the, people, in, this, populist, governance, can, lead, to, what, the, liberal, philosopher, john, stuart, mill, described, as, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, populists, tend, to, view, democratic, institutions, as, alienating, and, in, practice, populists, operating, in, liberal, democracies, have, often, criticised, the, independent, institutions, designed, to, protect, the, fundamental, rights, of, minorities, particularly, the, judiciary, and, the, media, berlusconi, for, instance, criticised, the, italian, judiciary, for, defending, the, rights, of, communists, in, countries, like, hungary, ecuador, and, venezuela, populist, governments, have, curtailed, the, independent, media, minorities, have, often, suffered, as, a, result, in, europe, in, particular, ethnic, minorities, have, had, their, rights, undermined, by, populism, while, in, latin, america, it, is, political, opposition, groups, who, have, been, undermined, by, populist, governments, in, several, instances, such, as, orban, in, hungary, the, populist, leader, has, set, the, country, on, a, path, of, de, democratisation, by, changing, the, constitution, to, centralise, increasing, levels, of, power, in, the, head, of, government, a, december, 2018, study, of, 46, populist, leaders, argued, that, populists, regardless, of, their, position, on, the, political, spectrum, were, more, likely, to, damage, democratic, institutions, erode, checks, and, balances, on, the, executive, branch, cause, democratic, backsliding, and, attack, individual, rights, than, non, populists, in, contrast, an, analysis, of, the, v, party, dataset, demonstrates, moderate, levels, of, populism, are, not, necessarily, antidemocratic, only, high, levels, of, populism, are, related, to, higher, autocratization, even, when, not, elected, into, office, populist, parties, can, have, an, impact, in, shaping, the, national, political, agenda, in, western, europe, parties, like, the, french, national, front, and, danish, people, s, party, did, not, generally, get, more, than, 10, or, 20, of, the, national, vote, but, mainstream, parties, shifted, their, own, policies, to, meet, the, populist, challenge, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, suggested, that, to, deflate, the, appeal, of, populism, those, government, figures, found, guilty, of, corruption, need, to, be, seen, to, face, adequate, punishment, they, also, argued, that, stronger, rule, of, law, and, the, elimination, of, systemic, corruption, were, also, important, facets, in, preventing, populist, growth, they, believed, that, mainstream, politicians, wishing, to, reduce, the, populist, challenge, should, be, more, open, about, the, restrictions, of, their, power, noting, that, those, who, backed, populist, movements, were, often, frustrated, with, the, dishonesty, of, established, politicians, who, claim, full, agency, when, things, go, well, and, almost, full, lack, of, agency, when, things, go, wrong, they, also, suggested, that, the, appeal, of, populism, could, be, reduced, by, wider, civic, education, in, the, values, of, liberal, democracy, and, the, relevance, of, pluralism, what, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, believed, was, ineffective, was, a, full, frontal, attack, on, the, populists, which, presented, them, as, evil, or, foolish, for, this, strategy, plays, into, the, binary, division, that, populists, themselves, employ, in, their, view, the, best, way, to, deal, with, populism, is, to, engage, as, difficult, as, it, is, in, an, open, dialogue, with, populist, actors, and, supporters, in, order, to, better, understand, the, claims, and, grievances, of, the, populist, elites, and, masses, and, to, develop, liberal, democratic, responses, to, them, in, trying, to, win, over, populist, supporters, and, perhaps, even, some, elites, liberal, democrats, should, avoid, both, simplistic, solutions, that, pander, to, the, people, and, elitist, discourses, that, dismiss, the, moral, and, intellectual, competence, of, ordinary, citizens, both, will, only, strengthen, the, populists, most, importantly, given, that, populism, often, asks, the, right, questions, but, provides, the, wrong, answers, the, ultimate, goal, should, be, not, just, the, destruction, of, populist, supply, but, also, the, weakening, of, populist, demand, only, the, latter, will, actually, strengthen, liberal, democracy, political, scientists, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, mainstream, politicians, have, sometimes, sought, to, co, operate, or, build, alliances, with, populists, in, the, united, states, for, example, various, republican, party, figures, aligned, themselves, with, the, tea, party, movement, while, in, countries, such, as, finland, and, austria, populist, parties, have, taken, part, in, governing, coalitions, in, other, instances, mainstream, politicians, have, adopted, elements, of, a, populist, political, style, while, competing, against, populist, opponents, various, mainstream, centrist, figures, such, as, hillary, clinton, and, tony, blair, have, argued, that, governments, needed, to, restrict, migration, to, hinder, the, appeal, of, right, wing, populists, utilising, anti, immigrant, sentiment, in, elections, a, more, common, approach, has, been, for, mainstream, parties, to, openly, attack, the, populists, and, construct, a, cordon, sanitaire, to, prevent, them, from, gaining, political, office, once, populists, are, in, political, office, in, liberal, democracies, the, judiciary, can, play, a, key, role, in, blocking, some, of, their, more, illiberal, policies, as, has, been, the, case, in, slovakia, and, poland, the, mainstream, media, can, play, an, important, role, in, blocking, populist, growth, in, a, country, like, germany, the, mainstream, media, is, for, instant, resolutely, anti, populist, opposing, populist, groups, whether, left, or, right, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, noted, that, there, was, an, odd, love, hate, relationship, between, populist, media, and, politicians, sharing, a, discourse, but, not, a, struggle, in, certain, countries, certain, mainstream, media, outlets, have, supported, populist, groups, in, austria, the, kronen, zeitung, played, a, prominent, role, in, endorsing, haider, in, the, united, kingdom, the, daily, express, supported, the, uk, independence, party, while, in, the, united, states, fox, news, gave, much, positive, coverage, and, encouragement, to, the, tea, party, movement, in, some, cases, when, the, populists, have, taken, power, their, political, rivals, have, sought, to, violently, overthrow, them, this, was, seen, in, the, 2002, venezuelan, coup, d, tat, attempt, when, mainstream, groups, worked, with, sectors, of, the, military, to, unseat, hugo, ch, vez, s, government, another, discursive, strategy, of, mainstream, parties, dealing, with, populist, actors, is, demonization, however, schw, rer, and, fern, ndez, garc, a, found, that, this, practice, is, less, common, in, western, europe, as, usually, assumed, and, that, the, center, right, even, refuses, to, harshly, attack, the, populist, radical, right, in, a, similar, vein, mainstream, parties, use, the, term, populism, to, delegitimize, populist, actors, due, to, its, negative, connotation, among, the, public, but, also, use, the, term, to, attack, non, populist, competitors, scholars, have, argued, that, populist, elements, have, sometimes, appeared, in, authoritarian, movements, some, but, not, all, populists, are, authoritarian, emphasizing, the, importance, of, protecting, traditional, lifestyles, against, perceived, threats, from, outsiders, even, at, the, expense, of, civil, liberties, and, minority, rights, the, historian, roger, eatwell, noted, that, major, ideological, differences, lie, at, the, core, of, fascism, and, populism, the, former, being, anti, democratic, and, latter, being, rooted, in, democracy, albeit, not, liberal, democracy, however, he, says, that, fascist, politicians, have, borrowed, aspects, of, populist, discourse, and, style, some, fascists, have, for, instance, used, the, terms, people, and, nation, synonymously, the, historian, peter, fritzsche, argued, that, populist, movements, active, in, weimar, germany, helped, to, facilitate, the, environment, in, which, the, fascist, nazi, party, could, rise, to, power, and, that, the, nazis, utilised, at, least, rhetorically, the, populist, ideal, of, the, people, s, community, the, scholar, luke, march, argued, that, the, populist, narodnik, movement, of, late, 19th, century, russia, influenced, the, radical, rejection, on, the, constitutional, limits, of, the, state, found, in, marxism, leninism, although, the, marxist, leninist, movement, often, used, populist, rhetoric, in, the, 1960s, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, called, itself, the, party, of, the, soviet, people, in, practice, its, emphasis, on, an, elite, vanguard, is, anti, populist, in, basis, in, recent, history, a, 2018, analysis, by, political, scientists, yascha, mounk, and, jordan, kyle, links, populism, to, democratic, backsliding, showing, that, since, 1990, five, out, of, 13, elected, right, wing, populist, governments, and, five, out, of, 15, elected, left, wing, populist, governments, brought, about, significant, democratic, backsliding, from, the, left, the, pink, tide, spreading, over, latin, america, was, prone, to, populism, and, authoritarianism, correa, in, ecuador, and, hugo, ch, vez, in, venezuela, and, his, regional, allies, used, populism, to, achieve, their, dominance, and, later, established, authoritarian, regimes, when, they, were, empowered, such, actions, weyland, argues, proves, that, populism, is, a, strategy, for, winning, and, exerting, state, power, and, stands, in, tension, with, democracy, and, the, values, of, pluralism, open, debate, and, fair, competition, in, 2019, pippa, norris, and, ronald, inglehart, classified, over, 50, european, political, parties, as, authoritarian, populist, as, well, as, world, leaders, like, donald, trump, silvio, burlesconi, viktor, orb, n, hugo, ch, vez, nicholas, maduro, jair, bolsonaro, narendra, modi, and, rodrigo, duterte, they, described, the, combination, of, authoritarian, values, disguised, in, populist, rhetoric, as, perhaps, the, most, dangerous, threat, to, liberal, democracy, they, also, argue, that, authoritarian, populism, provides, a, more, powerful, analytical, lens, than, conventional, labels, like, right, wing, populism, although, the, term, populist, can, be, traced, back, to, populares, courting, the, people, senators, in, ancient, rome, the, first, political, movements, emerged, during, the, late, nineteenth, century, however, some, of, the, movements, that, have, been, portrayed, as, progenitors, of, modern, populism, did, not, develop, a, truly, populist, ideology, it, was, only, with, the, coming, of, boulangism, in, france, and, the, american, people, s, party, which, was, also, known, as, the, populist, party, that, the, foundational, forms, of, populism, can, fully, be, discerned, in, particular, it, was, during, this, era, that, terms, such, as, people, and, popular, sovereignty, became, a, major, part, of, the, vocabulary, of, insurgent, political, movements, that, courted, mass, support, among, an, expanding, electorate, by, claiming, that, they, uniquely, embodied, their, interests, political, historian, roger, eatwell, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, argue, that, populism, is, a, modern, phenomenon, however, attempts, have, been, made, to, identify, manifestations, of, populism, in, the, democracy, of, classical, athens, eatwell, noted, that, although, the, actual, term, populism, parallels, that, of, the, populares, who, were, active, in, the, roman, republic, these, and, other, pre, modern, groups, did, not, develop, a, truly, populist, ideology, the, origins, of, populism, are, often, traced, to, the, late, nineteenth, century, when, movements, calling, themselves, populist, arose, in, both, the, united, states, and, the, russian, empire, populism, has, often, been, linked, to, the, spread, of, democracy, both, as, an, idea, and, as, a, framework, for, governance, conversely, the, historian, barry, s, strauss, argued, that, populism, could, also, be, seen, in, the, ancient, world, citing, the, examples, of, the, fifth, century, b, c, athens, and, populares, a, political, faction, active, in, the, roman, republic, from, the, second, century, bce, the, historian, rachel, foxley, argued, that, the, levellers, of, 17th, century, england, could, also, be, labelled, populists, meaning, that, they, believed, equal, natural, rights, must, shape, political, life, while, the, historian, peter, blickle, linked, populism, to, the, protestant, reformation, in, the, russian, empire, during, the, late, 19th, century, the, narodnichestvo, movement, emerged, championing, the, cause, of, the, empire, s, peasantry, against, the, governing, elites, the, movement, was, unable, to, secure, its, objectives, however, it, inspired, other, agrarian, movements, across, eastern, europe, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, the, russian, movement, was, primarily, a, movement, of, the, middle, class, and, intellectuals, going, to, the, people, in, some, respects, their, agrarian, populism, was, similar, to, that, of, the, us, people, s, party, with, both, presenting, small, farmers, the, peasantry, in, europe, as, the, foundation, of, society, and, main, source, of, societal, morality, according, to, eatwell, the, narodniks, are, often, seen, as, the, first, populist, movement, in, german, speaking, europe, the, v, lkisch, movement, has, often, been, characterised, as, populist, with, its, exultation, of, the, german, people, and, its, anti, elitist, attacks, on, capitalism, and, jews, in, france, the, boulangist, movement, also, utilised, populist, rhetoric, and, themes, in, the, early, 20th, century, adherents, of, both, marxism, and, fascism, flirted, with, populism, but, both, movements, remained, ultimately, elitist, emphasising, the, idea, of, a, small, elite, who, should, guide, and, govern, society, among, marxists, the, emphasis, on, class, struggle, and, the, idea, that, the, working, classes, are, affected, by, false, consciousness, are, also, antithetical, to, populist, ideas, after, 1945, populism, was, largely, absent, from, europe, in, part, due, to, the, domination, of, marxism, leninism, in, eastern, europe, and, a, desire, to, emphasise, moderation, among, many, west, european, political, parties, however, over, the, coming, decades, a, number, of, right, wing, populist, parties, emerged, throughout, the, continent, these, were, largely, isolated, and, mostly, reflected, a, conservative, agricultural, backlash, against, the, centralisation, and, politicisation, of, the, agricultural, sector, then, occurring, these, included, guglielmo, giannini, s, common, man, s, front, in, 1940s, italy, pierre, poujade, s, union, for, the, defense, of, tradesmen, and, artisans, in, late, 1950s, france, hendrik, koekoek, s, farmers, party, of, the, 1960s, netherlands, and, mogens, glistrup, s, progress, party, of, 1970s, denmark, between, the, late, 1960s, and, the, early, 1980s, there, also, came, a, concerted, populist, critique, of, society, from, europe, s, new, left, including, from, the, new, social, movements, and, from, the, early, green, parties, however, it, was, only, in, the, late, 1990s, according, to, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, that, populism, became, a, relevant, political, force, in, europe, one, which, could, have, a, significant, impact, on, mainstream, politics, following, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, eastern, bloc, of, the, early, 1990s, there, was, a, rise, in, populism, across, much, of, central, and, eastern, europe, in, the, first, multiparty, elections, in, many, of, these, countries, various, parties, portrayed, themselves, as, representatives, of, the, people, against, the, elite, representing, the, old, governing, marxist, leninist, parties, the, czech, civic, forum, party, for, instance, campaigned, on, the, slogan, parties, are, for, party, members, civic, forum, is, for, everybody, many, populists, in, this, region, claimed, that, a, real, revolution, had, not, occurred, during, the, transition, from, marxist, leninist, to, liberal, democratic, governance, in, the, early, 1990s, and, that, it, was, they, who, were, campaigning, for, such, a, change, the, collapse, of, marxism, leninism, as, a, central, force, in, socialist, politics, also, led, to, a, broader, growth, of, left, wing, populism, across, europe, reflected, in, groups, like, the, dutch, socialist, party, scottish, socialist, party, and, german, s, the, left, party, since, the, late, 1980s, populist, experiences, emerged, in, spain, around, the, figures, of, jos, mar, a, ruiz, mateos, jes, s, gil, and, mario, conde, businessmen, who, entered, politics, chiefly, to, defend, their, personal, economic, interests, but, by, the, turn, of, the, millennium, their, proposals, had, proved, to, meet, a, limited, support, at, the, ballots, at, the, national, level, at, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, populist, rhetoric, and, movements, became, increasingly, apparent, in, western, europe, populist, rhetoric, was, often, used, by, opposition, parties, for, example, in, the, 2001, electoral, campaign, the, conservative, party, leader, william, hague, accused, tony, blair, s, governing, labour, party, government, of, representing, the, condescending, liberal, elite, hague, repeatedly, referring, to, it, as, metropolitan, implying, that, it, was, out, of, touch, with, the, people, who, in, conservative, discourse, are, represented, by, middle, england, blair, s, government, also, employed, populist, rhetoric, in, outlining, legislation, to, curtail, fox, hunting, on, animal, welfare, grounds, it, presented, itself, as, championing, the, desires, of, the, majority, against, the, upper, classes, who, engaged, in, the, sport, blair, s, rhetoric, has, been, characterised, as, the, adoption, of, a, populist, style, rather, than, the, expression, of, an, underlying, populist, ideology, by, the, 21st, century, european, populism, was, again, associated, largely, with, the, political, right, the, term, came, to, be, used, in, reference, both, to, radical, right, groups, like, j, rg, haider, s, fp, in, austria, and, jean, marie, le, pen, s, fn, in, france, as, well, as, to, non, radical, right, wing, groups, like, silvio, berlusconi, s, forza, italia, or, pim, fortuyn, s, lpf, in, the, netherlands, the, populist, radical, right, combined, populism, with, authoritarianism, and, nativism, conversely, the, great, recession, also, resulted, in, the, emergence, of, left, wing, populist, groups, in, parts, of, europe, most, notably, the, syriza, party, which, gained, political, office, in, greece, and, the, podemos, party, in, spain, displaying, similarities, with, the, us, based, occupy, movement, like, europe, s, right, wing, populists, these, groups, also, expressed, eurosceptic, sentiment, towards, the, european, union, albeit, largely, from, a, socialist, and, anti, austerity, perspective, rather, than, the, nationalist, perspective, adopted, by, their, right, wing, counterparts, populists, have, entered, government, in, many, countries, across, europe, both, in, coalitions, with, other, parties, as, well, by, themselves, austria, and, poland, are, examples, of, these, respectively, the, uk, labour, party, under, the, leadership, of, jeremy, corbyn, has, been, called, populist, with, the, slogan, for, the, many, not, the, few, having, been, used, after, the, 2016, uk, referendum, on, membership, of, the, european, union, in, which, british, citizens, voted, to, leave, some, have, claimed, the, brexit, as, a, victory, for, populism, encouraging, a, flurry, of, calls, for, referendums, among, other, eu, countries, by, populist, political, parties, in, north, america, populism, has, often, been, characterised, by, regional, mobilisation, and, loose, organisation, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, populist, sentiments, became, widespread, particularly, in, the, western, provinces, of, canada, and, in, the, southwest, and, great, plains, regions, of, the, united, states, in, this, instance, populism, was, combined, with, agrarianism, and, often, known, as, prairie, populism, for, these, groups, the, people, were, yeomen, small, independent, farmers, while, the, elite, were, the, bankers, and, politicians, of, the, northeast, in, some, cases, populist, activists, called, for, alliances, with, labor, the, first, national, platform, of, the, national, people, s, party, in, 1892, calling, for, protecting, the, rights, of, urban, workmen, in, the, state, of, georgia, in, the, early, 1890s, thomas, e, watson, led, a, major, effort, to, unite, poor, white, farmers, and, included, some, african, american, farmers, the, people, s, party, of, the, late, 19th, century, united, states, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, defining, populist, movements, its, members, were, often, referred, to, as, the, populists, at, the, time, its, radical, platform, included, calling, for, the, nationalisation, of, railways, the, banning, of, strikebreakers, and, the, introduction, of, referendums, the, party, gained, representation, in, several, state, legislatures, during, the, 1890s, but, was, not, powerful, enough, to, mount, a, successful, presidential, challenge, in, the, 1896, presidential, election, the, people, s, party, supported, the, democratic, party, candidate, william, jennings, bryan, after, his, defeat, the, people, s, party, s, support, plunged, other, early, populist, political, parties, in, the, united, states, included, the, greenback, party, the, progressive, party, of, 1924, led, by, robert, m, la, follette, sr, and, the, share, our, wealth, movement, of, huey, p, long, in, 1933, 1935, in, canada, populist, groups, adhering, to, a, social, credit, ideology, had, various, successes, at, local, and, regional, elections, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1960s, although, the, main, social, credit, party, of, canada, never, became, a, dominant, national, force, by, the, mid, 20th, century, us, populism, had, moved, from, a, largely, progressive, to, a, largely, reactionary, stance, being, closely, intertwined, with, the, anti, communist, politics, of, the, period, in, this, period, the, historian, richard, hofstadter, and, sociologist, daniel, bell, compared, the, anti, elitism, of, the, 1890s, populists, with, that, of, joseph, mccarthy, although, not, all, academics, accepted, the, comparison, between, the, left, wing, anti, big, business, populists, and, the, right, wing, anti, communist, mccarthyites, the, term, populist, nonetheless, came, to, be, applied, to, both, left, wing, and, right, wing, groups, that, blamed, elites, for, the, problems, facing, the, country, some, mainstream, politicians, in, the, republican, party, recognised, the, utility, of, such, a, tactic, and, adopted, it, republican, president, richard, nixon, for, instance, popularised, the, term, silent, majority, when, appealing, to, voters, right, wing, populist, rhetoric, was, also, at, the, base, of, two, of, the, most, successful, third, party, presidential, campaigns, in, the, late, 20th, century, that, of, george, c, wallace, in, 1968, and, ross, perot, in, 1992, these, politicians, presented, a, consistent, message, that, a, liberal, elite, was, threatening, our, way, of, life, and, using, the, welfare, state, to, placate, the, poor, and, thus, maintain, their, own, power, former, oklahoma, senator, fred, r, harris, first, elected, in, 1964, ran, unsuccessfully, for, the, us, presidency, in, 1972, and, 1976, harris, new, populism, embraced, egalitarian, themes, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, two, populist, movements, appeared, in, the, us, both, in, response, to, the, great, recession, the, occupy, movement, and, the, tea, party, movement, the, populist, approach, of, the, occupy, movement, was, broader, with, its, people, being, what, it, called, the, 99, while, the, elite, it, challenged, was, presented, as, both, the, economic, and, political, elites, the, tea, party, s, populism, was, producerism, while, the, elite, it, presented, was, more, party, partisan, than, that, of, occupy, being, defined, largely, although, not, exclusively, as, the, democratic, administration, of, president, barack, obama, the, 2016, presidential, election, saw, a, wave, of, populist, sentiment, in, the, campaigns, of, bernie, sanders, and, donald, trump, with, both, candidates, running, on, anti, establishment, platforms, in, the, democratic, and, republican, parties, respectively, both, campaigns, criticised, free, trade, deals, such, as, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, and, the, trans, pacific, partnership, other, studies, have, noted, an, emergence, of, populist, rhetoric, and, a, decline, in, the, value, of, prior, experience, in, u, s, intra, party, contests, such, as, congressional, primaries, nativism, and, hostility, toward, immigrants, especially, muslims, hispanics, and, asians, were, common, features, populism, has, been, dominant, in, latin, american, politics, since, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, being, far, more, prevalent, there, than, in, europe, mudde, and, rovira, kaltwasser, noted, that, the, region, has, the, world, s, most, enduring, and, prevalent, populist, tradition, they, suggested, that, this, was, the, case, because, it, was, a, region, with, a, long, tradition, of, democratic, governance, and, free, elections, but, with, high, rates, of, socio, economic, inequality, generating, widespread, resentments, that, politicians, can, articulate, through, populism, march, instead, thought, that, it, was, the, important, role, of, catch, all, parties, and, prominent, personalities, in, latin, american, politics, which, had, made, populism, more, common, the, first, wave, of, latin, american, populism, began, at, the, start, of, the, great, depression, in, 1929, and, last, until, the, end, of, the, 1960s, in, various, countries, politicians, took, power, while, emphasising, the, people, these, included, get, lio, vargas, in, brazil, juan, per, n, in, argentina, and, jos, mar, a, velasco, ibarra, in, ecuador, these, relied, on, the, americanismo, ideology, presenting, a, common, identity, across, latin, america, and, denouncing, any, interference, from, imperialist, powers, the, second, wave, took, place, in, the, early, 1990s, de, la, torre, called, it, neoliberal, populism, in, the, late, 1980s, many, latin, american, states, were, experiencing, economic, crisis, and, several, populist, figures, were, elected, by, blaming, the, elites, for, this, situation, examples, include, carlos, menem, in, argentina, fernando, collor, de, mello, in, brazil, and, alberto, fujimori, in, peru, once, in, power, these, individuals, pursued, neoliberal, economic, strategies, recommended, by, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, unlike, the, first, wave, the, second, did, not, include, an, emphasis, on, americanismo, or, anti, imperialism, the, third, wave, began, in, the, final, years, of, the, 1990s, and, continued, into, the, 21st, century, it, overlapped, in, part, with, the, pink, tide, of, left, wing, resurgence, in, latin, america, like, the, first, wave, the, third, made, heavy, use, of, americanismo, and, anti, imperialism, although, this, time, these, themes, presented, alongside, an, explicitly, socialist, programme, that, opposed, the, free, market, prominent, examples, included, hugo, ch, vez, in, venezuela, cristina, de, kirchner, in, argentina, evo, morales, in, bolivia, rafael, correa, in, ecuador, and, daniel, ortega, in, nicaragua, these, socialist, populist, governments, have, presented, themselves, as, giving, sovereignty, back, to, the, people, in, particular, through, the, formation, of, constituent, assemblies, that, would, draw, up, new, constitutions, which, could, then, be, ratified, via, referendums, in, this, way, they, claimed, to, be, correcting, the, problems, of, social, and, economic, injustice, that, liberal, democracy, had, failed, to, deal, with, replacing, it, with, superior, forms, of, democracy, during, the, 1990s, there, was, a, growth, in, populism, in, both, australia, and, new, zealand, in, new, zealand, robert, muldoon, the, 31st, prime, minister, of, new, zealand, from, 1975, to, 1984, had, been, cited, as, a, populist, populism, has, become, a, pervasive, trend, in, new, zealand, politics, since, the, introduction, of, the, mixed, member, proportional, voting, system, in, 1996, the, new, zealand, labour, party, s, populist, appeals, in, its, 1999, election, campaign, and, advertising, helped, to, propel, the, party, to, victory, in, that, election, new, zealand, first, has, presented, a, more, lasting, populist, platform, long, time, party, leader, winston, peters, has, been, characterised, by, some, as, a, populist, who, uses, anti, establishment, rhetoric, though, in, a, uniquely, new, zealand, style, in, much, of, africa, populism, has, been, a, rare, phenomenon, the, political, scientist, danielle, resnick, argued, that, populism, first, became, apparent, in, africa, during, the, 1980s, when, a, series, of, coups, brought, military, leaders, to, power, in, various, countries, in, ghana, for, example, jerry, rawlings, took, control, professing, that, he, would, involve, the, people, in, the, decision, making, process, something, he, claimed, had, previously, been, denied, to, them, a, similar, process, took, place, in, neighbouring, burkina, faso, under, the, military, leader, thomas, sankara, who, professed, to, take, power, out, of, the, hands, of, our, national, bourgeoisie, and, their, imperialist, allies, and, put, it, in, the, hands, of, the, people, such, military, leaders, claimed, to, represent, the, voice, of, the, people, utilised, an, anti, establishment, discourse, and, established, participatory, organisations, through, which, to, maintain, links, with, the, broader, population, in, the, 21st, century, with, the, establishment, of, multi, party, democratic, systems, in, much, of, sub, saharan, africa, new, populist, politicians, have, appeared, these, have, included, kenya, s, raila, odinga, senegal, s, abdoulaye, wade, south, africa, s, julius, malema, and, zambia, s, michael, sata, these, populists, have, arisen, in, democratic, rather, than, authoritarian, states, and, have, arisen, amid, dissatisfaction, with, democratisation, socio, economic, grievances, and, frustration, at, the, inability, of, opposition, groups, to, oust, incumbent, parties, in, north, africa, populism, was, associated, with, the, approaches, of, several, political, leaders, active, in, the, 20th, century, most, notably, egypt, s, gamal, abdel, nasser, and, libya, s, muammar, gaddafi, however, populist, approaches, only, became, more, popular, in, the, middle, east, during, the, early, 21st, century, by, which, point, it, became, integral, to, much, of, the, region, s, politics, here, it, became, an, increasingly, common, element, of, mainstream, politics, in, established, representative, democracies, associated, with, longstanding, leaders, like, israel, s, benjamin, netanyahu, although, the, arab, spring, was, not, a, populist, movement, itself, populist, rhetoric, was, present, among, protesters, in, southeast, asia, populist, politicians, emerged, in, the, wake, of, the, 1997, asian, financial, crisis, in, the, region, various, populist, governments, took, power, but, were, removed, soon, after, these, include, the, administrations, of, joseph, estrada, in, the, philippines, roh, moo, hyun, in, south, korea, chen, shui, bian, in, taiwan, and, thaksin, shinawatra, in, thailand, in, india, the, hindu, nationalist, bharatiya, janata, party, bjp, which, rose, to, increasing, power, in, the, early, 21st, century, adopted, a, right, wing, populist, position, unlike, many, other, successful, populist, groups, the, bjp, was, not, wholly, reliant, on, the, personality, of, its, leader, but, survived, as, a, powerful, electoral, vehicle, under, several, leaders, sheri, berman, reviews, various, explanations, of, populism, including, demand, and, supply, side, explanations, of, populism, economic, grievance, based, and, sociocultural, grievance, based, explanations, of, populism, and, structure, and, agency, based, explanations, of, populism, there, is, now, a, wide, ranging, and, interdisciplinary, literature, in, this, area, in, the, early, 1990s, there, was, an, increasing, awareness, of, populism, in, established, liberal, democracies, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, new, populism, the, uk, s, referendum, on, european, union, membership, and, the, election, of, donald, trump, both, in, 2016, generated, a, substantial, rise, in, interest, in, the, concept, from, both, academics, and, the, public, by, 2016, populism, was, regularly, used, by, political, commentators, a, 2017, review, of, votes, for, populistic, parties, in, all, developed, countries, discovered, them, spiking, in, 2015, and, reaching, highest, levels, since, wwii, the, rise, of, populism, in, western, europe, is, in, large, part, a, reaction, to, the, failure, of, traditional, parties, to, respond, adequately, in, the, eyes, of, the, electorate, to, a, series, of, phenomena, such, as, economic, and, cultural, globalisation, the, speed, and, direction, of, european, integration, immigration, the, decline, of, ideologies, and, class, politics, exposure, of, elite, corruption, etc, it, is, also, the, product, of, a, much, cited, but, rarely, defined, political, malaise, manifested, in, steadily, falling, voter, turnout, across, western, europe, declining, political, party, membership, and, ever, greater, numbers, of, citizens, in, surveys, citing, a, lack, of, interest, and, distrust, in, politics, and, politicians, albertazzi, and, mcdonnell, 2008, mudde, argued, that, by, the, early, 1990s, populism, had, become, a, regular, feature, in, western, democracies, he, attributed, this, to, changing, perceptions, of, government, that, had, spread, in, this, period, which, in, turn, he, traced, to, the, changing, role, of, the, media, to, focus, increasingly, on, sensationalism, and, scandals, since, the, late, 1960s, the, emergence, of, television, had, allowed, for, the, increasing, proliferation, of, the, western, media, with, media, outlets, becoming, increasingly, independent, of, political, parties, as, private, media, companies, have, had, to, compete, against, each, other, they, have, placed, an, increasing, focus, on, scandals, and, other, sensationalist, elements, of, politics, in, doing, so, promoting, anti, governmental, sentiments, among, their, readership, and, cultivating, an, environment, prime, for, populists, at, the, same, time, politicians, increasingly, faced, television, interviews, exposing, their, flaws, news, media, had, also, taken, to, interviewing, fewer, accredited, experts, and, instead, favouring, interviewing, individuals, found, on, the, street, as, to, their, views, about, current, events, at, the, same, time, mass, media, was, giving, less, attention, to, the, high, culture, of, elites, and, more, to, other, sectors, of, society, as, reflected, in, reality, television, shows, such, as, big, brother, mudde, argued, that, another, reason, for, the, growth, of, western, populism, in, this, period, was, the, improved, education, of, the, populace, since, the, 1960s, citizens, have, expected, more, from, their, politicians, and, felt, increasingly, competent, to, judge, their, actions, this, in, turn, has, led, to, an, increasingly, sceptical, attitude, toward, mainstream, politicians, and, governing, groups, in, mudde, s, words, more, and, more, citizens, think, they, have, a, good, understanding, of, what, politicians, do, and, think, they, can, do, it, better, another, factor, is, that, in, the, post, cold, war, period, liberal, democracies, no, longer, had, the, one, party, states, of, the, eastern, bloc, against, which, to, favourably, compare, themselves, citizens, were, therefore, increasingly, able, to, compare, the, realities, of, the, liberal, democratic, system, with, theoretical, models, of, democracy, and, find, the, former, wanting, there, is, also, the, impact, of, globalisation, which, is, seen, as, having, seriously, limited, the, powers, of, national, elites, such, factors, undermine, citizens, belief, in, the, competency, of, governing, elite, opening, up, space, for, charismatic, leadership, to, become, increasingly, popular, although, charismatic, leadership, is, not, the, same, as, populist, leadership, populists, have, been, the, main, winners, of, this, shift, towards, charismatic, leadership, peter, wilkins, has, argued, that, the, end, of, history, and, the, post, cold, war, extension, and, deepening, of, capitalism, are, central, to, understanding, the, rise, of, contemporary, populist, movements, pippa, norris, and, ronald, inglehart, connect, economic, and, sociocultural, theories, of, the, causes, of, support, for, the, growing, populist, movements, in, western, societies, the, first, theory, they, examine, is, the, economic, insecurity, perspective, which, focuses, on, the, consequences, created, by, a, transforming, contemporary, workforce, and, society, in, post, industrial, economies, norris, suggests, that, events, such, as, globalisation, china, s, membership, of, the, world, trade, organisation, and, cheaper, imports, have, left, the, unsecured, members, of, society, low, waged, unskilled, workers, single, parents, the, long, term, unemployed, and, the, poorer, white, populations, seeking, populist, leaders, such, as, donald, trump, and, nigel, farage, the, other, theory, is, the, cultural, backlash, thesis, in, which, norris, and, inglehart, suggest, that, the, rise, of, populism, is, a, reaction, from, previously, dominant, sectors, of, the, population, the, white, uneducated, elderly, men, of, today, who, feel, threatened, and, marginalised, by, the, progressive, values, of, modern, society, these, groups, in, particular, have, a, growing, resentment, towards, their, traditional, values, being, scolded, as, politically, incorrect, and, are, much, more, likely, to, become, supportive, of, anti, establishment, xenophobic, political, parties, norris, and, inglehart, have, analyzed, data, from, the, world, values, survey, on, this, basis, they, argue, that, while, the, proximate, cause, of, right, wing, populist, voting, may, be, identified, in, sociocultural, grievances, such, grievances, are, increasingly, being, driven, by, economic, insecurity, and, the, erosion, of, traditional, values, using, brexit, and, trump, s, election, as, examples, michael, sandel, in, his, 2020, book, the, tyranny, of, merit, argues, that, populism, came, out, of, disenchantment, with, meritocratic, elites, ruling, over, disenchanted, working, people, he, states, the, popular, backlash, against, meritocracy, predicted, by, michael, dunlop, young, in, the, rise, of, the, meritocracy, to, occur, in, the, 2030s, in, fact, arrived, a, few, decades, early, sandel, suggests, political, systems, that, reject, meritocracy, and, champion, the, dignity, of, labour, as, the, solution, to, this, problem
