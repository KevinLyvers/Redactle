the, food, industry, is, a, complex, global, network, of, diverse, businesses, that, supplies, most, of, the, food, consumed, by, the, world, s, population, the, food, industry, today, has, become, highly, diversified, with, manufacturing, ranging, from, small, traditional, family, run, activities, that, are, highly, labour, intensive, to, large, capital, intensive, and, highly, mechanized, industrial, processes, many, food, industries, depend, almost, entirely, on, local, agriculture, animal, farms, produce, and, or, fishing, it, is, challenging, to, find, an, inclusive, way, to, cover, all, aspects, of, food, production, and, sale, the, uk, food, standards, agency, describes, it, as, the, whole, food, industry, from, farming, and, food, production, packaging, and, distribution, to, retail, and, catering, the, economic, research, service, of, the, usda, uses, the, term, food, system, to, describe, the, same, thing, stating, the, u, s, food, system, is, a, complex, network, of, farmers, and, the, industries, that, link, to, them, those, links, include, makers, of, farm, equipment, and, chemicals, as, well, as, firms, that, provide, services, to, agribusinesses, such, as, providers, of, transportation, and, financial, services, the, system, also, includes, the, food, marketing, industries, that, link, farms, to, consumers, and, which, include, food, and, fiber, processors, wholesalers, retailers, and, foodservice, establishments, the, food, industry, includes, areas, of, research, such, as, food, grading, food, preservation, food, rheology, food, storage, directly, deal, with, the, quality, and, maintenance, of, quality, overlapping, many, of, the, above, processes, only, subsistence, farmers, those, who, survive, on, what, they, grow, and, hunter, gatherers, can, be, considered, outside, the, scope, of, the, modern, food, industry, the, dominant, companies, in, the, food, industry, have, sometimes, been, referred, to, as, big, food, a, term, coined, by, the, writer, neil, hamilton, most, food, produced, for, the, food, industry, comes, from, commodity, crops, using, conventional, agricultural, practices, agriculture, is, the, process, of, producing, food, feeding, products, fiber, and, other, desired, products, by, the, cultivation, of, certain, plants, and, the, raising, of, domesticated, animals, livestock, on, average, 83, of, the, food, consumed, by, humans, is, produced, using, terrestrial, agriculture, in, addition, to, terrestrial, agriculture, aquaculture, and, fishing, play, vital, roles, in, global, food, production, aquaculture, involves, the, cultivation, of, aquatic, organisms, such, as, fish, shrimp, and, mollusks, in, controlled, environments, like, ponds, tanks, or, cages, it, contributes, significantly, to, the, world, s, seafood, supply, and, provides, an, important, source, of, protein, for, human, consumption, fishing, on, the, other, hand, relies, on, harvesting, wild, aquatic, species, from, oceans, rivers, and, lakes, further, diversifying, the, sources, of, food, for, human, populations, and, supporting, livelihoods, in, coastal, communities, worldwide, together, terrestrial, agriculture, aquaculture, and, fishing, collectively, ensure, a, diverse, and, ample, supply, of, food, to, meet, the, dietary, needs, of, people, across, the, globe, other, food, sources, include, aquaculture, and, fishing, scientists, inventors, and, others, devoted, to, improving, farming, methods, and, implements, are, also, said, to, be, engaged, in, agriculture, one, in, three, people, worldwide, are, employed, in, agriculture, yet, it, only, contributes, 3, to, global, gdp, in, 2017, on, average, agriculture, contributes, 4, of, national, gdps, global, agricultural, production, is, responsible, for, between, 14, and, 28, of, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, making, it, one, of, the, largest, contributors, to, global, warming, in, large, part, due, to, conventional, agricultural, practices, including, nitrogen, fertilizers, and, poor, land, management, agronomy, is, the, science, and, technology, of, producing, and, using, plants, for, food, fuel, fibre, and, land, reclamation, agronomy, encompasses, work, in, the, areas, of, plant, genetics, plant, physiology, meteorology, and, soil, science, agronomy, is, the, application, of, a, combination, of, sciences, agronomists, today, are, involved, with, many, issues, including, producing, food, creating, healthier, food, managing, the, environmental, impact, of, agriculture, and, extracting, energy, from, plants, food, processing, includes, the, methods, and, techniques, used, to, transform, raw, ingredients, into, food, for, human, consumption, food, processing, takes, clean, harvested, or, slaughtered, and, butchered, components, and, uses, them, to, produce, marketable, food, products, there, are, several, different, ways, in, which, food, can, be, produced, one, off, production, this, method, is, used, when, customers, make, an, order, for, something, to, be, made, to, their, own, specifications, for, example, a, wedding, cake, the, making, of, one, off, products, could, take, days, depending, on, how, intricate, the, design, is, batch, production, this, method, is, used, when, the, size, of, the, market, for, a, product, is, not, clear, and, where, there, is, a, range, within, a, product, line, a, certain, number, of, the, same, goods, will, be, produced, to, make, up, a, batch, or, run, for, example, a, bakery, may, bake, a, limited, number, of, cupcakes, this, method, involves, estimating, consumer, demand, mass, production, this, method, is, used, when, there, is, a, mass, market, for, a, large, number, of, identical, products, for, example, chocolate, bars, ready, meals, and, canned, food, the, product, passes, from, one, stage, of, production, to, another, along, a, production, line, just, in, time, jit, production, this, method, of, production, is, mainly, used, in, restaurants, all, components, of, the, product, are, available, in, house, and, the, customer, chooses, what, they, want, in, the, product, it, is, then, prepared, in, a, kitchen, or, in, front, of, the, buyer, as, in, sandwich, delicatessens, pizzerias, and, sushi, bars, the, food, industry, has, a, large, influence, on, consumerism, organizations, such, as, the, american, academy, of, family, physicians, aafp, have, been, criticized, for, accepting, monetary, donations, from, companies, within, the, food, industry, such, as, coca, cola, these, donations, have, been, criticized, for, creating, a, conflict, of, interest, and, favoring, an, interest, such, as, financial, gains, there, are, a, number, of, books, film, tv, and, web, related, expos, s, and, critiques, of, the, food, industry, including, the, bretton, woods, institutions, the, world, bank, and, international, monetary, fund, play, a, large, role, in, how, the, food, industry, functions, today, these, global, funds, were, born, after, world, war, ii, to, help, rebuild, europe, and, prevent, another, great, depression, overall, their, main, purpose, was, to, stabilize, economies, the, imf, provided, short, term, loans, while, the, world, bank, was, focused, on, larger, projects, that, would, bring, electricity, back, to, cities, roads, and, other, essential, needs, the, world, banks, mission, and, purpose, however, transformed, as, its, president, robert, mcnamara, issued, a, system, of, loans, known, as, structural, adjustment, in, accepting, loans, from, the, world, bank, countries, especially, the, global, south, became, economically, politically, and, socially, tied, to, the, west, many, countries, struggled, to, pay, back, their, loans, beginning, the, process, of, global, debt, privatization, and, the, downfall, of, local, economies, as, a, result, of, western, intervention, many, small, scale, farmers, have, been, displaced, as, us, corporations, have, bought, out, land, in, other, countries, and, continued, to, monopolize, on, food, today, several, multinational, corporations, have, pushed, agricultural, technologies, on, developing, countries, including, improved, seeds, chemical, fertilizers, and, pesticides, crop, production, in, 2020, scientists, reported, that, reducing, emissions, from, the, global, food, system, is, essential, to, achieving, the, paris, agreement, s, climate, goals, in, 2020, an, evidence, review, for, the, european, union, s, scientific, advice, mechanism, found, that, without, significant, change, emissions, would, increase, by, 30, 40, by, 2050, due, to, population, growth, and, changing, consumption, patterns, and, concluded, that, the, combined, environmental, cost, of, food, production, is, estimated, to, amount, to, some, 12, trillion, per, year, increasing, to, 16, trillion, by, 2050, the, ipcc, s, and, the, eu, s, reports, concluded, that, adapting, the, food, system, to, reduce, greenhouse, gas, emissions, impacts, and, food, security, concerns, while, shifting, towards, a, sustainable, diet, is, feasible, since, world, war, ii, agriculture, in, the, united, states, and, the, entire, national, food, system, in, its, entirety, has, been, characterized, by, models, that, focus, on, monetary, profitability, at, the, expense, of, social, and, environmental, integrity, regulations, exist, to, protect, consumers, and, somewhat, balance, this, economic, orientation, with, public, interests, for, food, quality, food, security, food, safety, animal, well, being, environmental, protection, and, health, in, 2020, researchers, published, projections, and, models, of, potential, impacts, of, policy, dependent, mechanisms, of, modulation, or, lack, thereof, of, how, where, and, what, food, is, produced, they, analyzed, policy, effects, for, specific, regions, or, nations, such, as, reduction, of, meat, production, and, consumption, reductions, in, food, waste, and, loss, increases, in, crop, yields, and, international, land, use, planning, their, conclusions, include, that, raising, agricultural, yields, is, highly, beneficial, for, biodiversity, conservation, in, sub, saharan, africa, while, measures, leading, to, shifts, of, diets, are, highly, beneficial, in, north, america, and, that, global, coordination, and, rapid, action, are, necessary, a, vast, global, cargo, network, connects, the, numerous, parts, of, the, industry, these, include, suppliers, manufacturers, warehousers, retailers, and, the, end, consumers, wholesale, markets, for, fresh, food, products, have, tended, to, decline, in, importance, in, urbanizing, countries, including, latin, america, and, some, asian, countries, as, a, result, of, the, growth, of, supermarkets, which, procure, directly, from, farmers, or, through, preferred, suppliers, rather, than, going, through, markets, the, constant, and, uninterrupted, flow, of, product, from, distribution, centers, to, store, locations, is, a, critical, link, in, food, industry, operations, distribution, centers, run, more, efficiently, throughput, can, be, increased, costs, can, be, lowered, and, manpower, better, utilized, if, the, proper, steps, are, taken, when, setting, up, a, material, handling, system, in, a, warehouse, with, worldwide, urbanization, food, buying, is, increasingly, removed, from, food, production, during, the, 20th, century, the, supermarket, became, the, defining, retail, element, of, the, food, industry, there, tens, of, thousands, of, products, are, gathered, in, one, location, in, continuous, year, round, supply, food, preparation, is, another, area, where, the, change, in, recent, decades, has, been, dramatic, today, two, food, industry, sectors, are, in, apparent, competition, for, the, retail, food, dollar, the, grocery, industry, sells, fresh, and, largely, raw, products, for, consumers, to, use, as, ingredients, in, home, cooking, the, food, service, industry, by, contrast, offers, prepared, food, either, as, finished, products, or, as, partially, prepared, components, for, final, assembly, restaurants, cafes, bakeries, and, mobile, food, trucks, provide, opportunities, for, consumers, to, purchase, food, in, the, 21st, century, online, grocery, stores, emerged, and, digital, technologies, for, community, supported, agriculture, have, enabled, farmers, to, directly, sell, produce, some, online, grocery, stores, have, voluntarily, set, social, goals, or, values, beyond, meeting, consumer, demand, and, the, accumulation, of, profit, modern, food, production, is, defined, by, sophisticated, technologies, these, include, many, areas, agricultural, machinery, originally, led, by, the, tractor, has, practically, eliminated, human, labor, in, many, areas, of, production, biotechnology, is, driving, much, change, in, areas, as, diverse, as, agrochemicals, plant, breeding, and, food, processing, many, other, types, of, technology, are, also, involved, to, the, point, where, it, is, hard, to, find, an, area, that, does, not, have, a, direct, impact, on, the, food, industry, as, in, other, fields, computer, technology, is, also, a, central, force, other, than, that, there, few, more, modern, technologies, that, can, help, to, improve, the, industry, as, well, which, are, robotics, and, automation, blockchain, nanotech, 3d, printing, artificial, intelligence, smart, farming, and, others, these, new, technologies, can, improve, the, industry, in, the, following, ways, as, consumers, grow, increasingly, removed, from, food, production, the, role, of, product, creation, advertising, and, publicity, become, the, primary, vehicles, for, information, about, food, with, processed, food, as, the, dominant, category, marketers, have, almost, infinite, possibilities, in, product, creation, of, the, food, advertised, to, children, on, television, 73, is, fast, or, convenience, foods, one, of, the, main, challenges, in, food, industry, marketing, is, the, high, level, of, competition, in, the, market, companies, must, differentiate, themselves, from, their, competitors, by, offering, unique, products, or, using, innovative, marketing, techniques, for, example, many, food, companies, are, now, using, social, media, platforms, to, promote, their, products, and, engage, with, customers, another, important, aspect, of, food, industry, marketing, is, understanding, consumer, behavior, and, preferences, this, includes, factors, such, as, age, gender, income, and, cultural, background, companies, must, also, be, aware, of, changing, consumer, trends, and, adapt, their, marketing, strategies, accordingly, until, the, last, 100, years, agriculture, was, labor, intensive, farming, was, a, common, occupation, and, millions, of, people, were, involved, in, food, production, farmers, largely, trained, from, generation, to, generation, carried, on, the, family, business, that, situation, has, changed, dramatically, today, in, america, in, 1870, 70, 80, of, the, us, population, was, employed, in, agriculture, as, of, 2021, less, than, 2, of, the, population, is, directly, employed, in, agriculture, and, about, 83, of, the, population, lives, in, cities
