philosophers, works, list, of, forms, of, government, constitutional, monarchy, also, known, as, limited, monarchy, parliamentary, monarchy, or, democratic, monarchy, is, a, form, of, monarchy, in, which, the, monarch, exercises, their, authority, in, accordance, with, a, constitution, and, is, not, alone, in, making, decisions, constitutional, monarchies, differ, from, absolute, monarchies, in, which, a, monarch, is, the, only, decision, maker, in, that, they, are, bound, to, exercise, powers, and, authorities, within, limits, prescribed, by, an, established, legal, framework, constitutional, monarchies, range, from, countries, such, as, liechtenstein, monaco, morocco, jordan, kuwait, bahrain, and, bhutan, where, the, constitution, grants, substantial, discretionary, powers, to, the, sovereign, to, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, and, other, commonwealth, realms, the, netherlands, spain, belgium, denmark, norway, sweden, lesotho, malaysia, thailand, cambodia, and, japan, where, the, monarch, retains, significantly, less, if, any, personal, discretion, in, the, exercise, of, their, authority, on, the, surface, level, this, distinction, may, be, hard, to, establish, with, numerous, liberal, democracies, restraining, monarchic, power, in, practice, rather, than, written, law, e, g, the, constitution, of, the, united, kingdom, which, affords, the, monarch, substantial, if, limited, legislative, and, executive, powers, constitutional, monarchy, may, refer, to, a, system, in, which, the, monarch, acts, as, a, non, party, political, ceremonial, head, of, state, under, the, constitution, whether, codified, or, uncodified, while, most, monarchs, may, hold, formal, authority, and, the, government, may, legally, operate, in, the, monarch, s, name, in, the, form, typical, in, europe, the, monarch, no, longer, personally, sets, public, policy, or, chooses, political, leaders, political, scientist, vernon, bogdanor, paraphrasing, thomas, macaulay, has, defined, a, constitutional, monarch, as, a, sovereign, who, reigns, but, does, not, rule, in, addition, to, acting, as, a, visible, symbol, of, national, unity, a, constitutional, monarch, may, hold, formal, powers, such, as, dissolving, parliament, or, giving, royal, assent, to, legislation, however, such, powers, generally, may, only, be, exercised, strictly, in, accordance, with, either, written, constitutional, principles, or, unwritten, constitutional, conventions, rather, than, any, personal, political, preferences, of, the, sovereign, in, the, english, constitution, british, political, theorist, walter, bagehot, identified, three, main, political, rights, which, a, constitutional, monarch, may, freely, exercise, the, right, to, be, consulted, the, right, to, encourage, and, the, right, to, warn, many, constitutional, monarchies, still, retain, significant, authorities, or, political, influence, however, such, as, through, certain, reserve, powers, and, may, also, play, an, important, political, role, the, commonwealth, realms, share, the, same, person, as, hereditary, monarchy, under, the, westminster, system, of, constitutional, governance, two, constitutional, monarchies, malaysia, and, cambodia, are, elective, monarchies, in, which, the, ruler, is, periodically, selected, by, a, small, electoral, college, the, concept, of, semi, constitutional, monarch, identifies, constitutional, monarchies, where, the, monarch, retains, substantial, powers, on, a, par, with, a, president, in, a, presidential, or, semi, presidential, system, as, a, result, constitutional, monarchies, where, the, monarch, has, a, largely, ceremonial, role, may, also, be, referred, to, as, parliamentary, monarchies, to, differentiate, them, from, semi, constitutional, monarchies, strongly, limited, constitutional, monarchies, such, as, those, of, the, united, kingdom, and, australia, have, been, referred, to, as, crowned, republics, by, writers, h, g, wells, and, glenn, patmore, the, oldest, constitutional, monarchy, dating, back, to, ancient, times, was, that, of, the, hittites, they, were, an, ancient, anatolian, people, that, lived, during, the, bronze, age, whose, king, had, to, share, his, authority, with, an, assembly, called, the, panku, which, was, the, equivalent, to, a, modern, day, deliberative, assembly, or, a, legislature, members, of, the, panku, came, from, scattered, noble, families, who, worked, as, representatives, of, their, subjects, in, an, adjutant, or, subaltern, federal, type, landscape, according, to, herodotus, demonax, created, a, constitutional, monarchy, for, king, battus, iii, the, lame, of, cyrene, when, cyrenaica, had, become, an, unstable, state, in, about, 548, bc, in, the, kingdom, of, england, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, furthered, the, constitutional, monarchy, restricted, by, laws, such, as, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, and, the, act, of, settlement, 1701, although, the, first, form, of, constitution, was, enacted, with, magna, carta, of, 1215, at, the, same, time, in, scotland, the, convention, of, estates, enacted, the, claim, of, right, act, 1689, which, placed, similar, limits, on, the, scottish, monarchy, queen, anne, was, the, last, monarch, to, veto, an, act, of, parliament, when, on, 11, march, 1708, she, blocked, the, scottish, militia, bill, however, hanoverian, monarchs, continued, to, selectively, dictate, government, policies, for, instance, king, george, iii, constantly, blocked, catholic, emancipation, eventually, precipitating, the, resignation, of, william, pitt, the, younger, as, prime, minister, in, 1801, the, sovereign, s, influence, on, the, choice, of, prime, minister, gradually, declined, over, this, period, king, william, iv, was, the, last, monarch, to, dismiss, a, prime, minister, when, in, 1834, he, removed, lord, melbourne, as, a, result, of, melbourne, s, choice, of, lord, john, russell, as, leader, of, the, house, of, commons, queen, victoria, was, the, last, monarch, to, exercise, real, personal, power, but, this, diminished, over, the, course, of, her, reign, in, 1839, she, became, the, last, sovereign, to, keep, a, prime, minister, in, power, against, the, will, of, parliament, when, the, bedchamber, crisis, resulted, in, the, retention, of, lord, melbourne, s, administration, by, the, end, of, her, reign, however, she, could, do, nothing, to, block, the, unacceptable, to, her, premierships, of, william, gladstone, although, she, still, exercised, power, in, appointments, to, the, cabinet, for, example, in, 1886, she, vetoed, gladstone, s, choice, of, hugh, childers, as, war, secretary, in, favour, of, sir, henry, campbell, bannerman, today, the, role, of, the, british, monarch, is, by, convention, effectively, ceremonial, the, british, parliament, and, the, government, chiefly, in, the, office, of, prime, minister, of, the, united, kingdom, exercise, their, powers, under, royal, or, crown, prerogative, on, behalf, of, the, monarch, and, through, powers, still, formally, possessed, by, the, monarch, no, person, may, accept, significant, public, office, without, swearing, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, king, with, few, exceptions, the, monarch, is, bound, by, constitutional, convention, to, act, on, the, advice, of, the, government, poland, developed, the, first, constitution, for, a, monarchy, in, continental, europe, with, the, constitution, of, 3, may, 1791, it, was, the, second, single, document, constitution, in, the, world, just, after, the, first, republican, constitution, of, the, united, states, constitutional, monarchy, also, occurred, briefly, in, the, early, years, of, the, french, revolution, but, much, more, widely, afterwards, napoleon, bonaparte, is, considered, the, first, monarch, proclaiming, himself, as, an, embodiment, of, the, nation, rather, than, as, a, divinely, appointed, ruler, this, interpretation, of, monarchy, is, germane, to, continental, constitutional, monarchies, german, philosopher, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, in, his, work, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, right, 1820, gave, the, concept, a, philosophical, justification, that, concurred, with, evolving, contemporary, political, theory, and, the, protestant, christian, view, of, natural, law, hegel, s, forecast, of, a, constitutional, monarch, with, very, limited, powers, whose, function, is, to, embody, the, national, character, and, provide, constitutional, continuity, in, times, of, emergency, was, reflected, in, the, development, of, constitutional, monarchies, in, europe, and, japan, there, exist, at, least, two, different, types, of, constitutional, monarchies, in, the, modern, world, executive, and, ceremonial, in, executive, monarchies, the, monarch, wields, significant, though, not, absolute, power, the, monarchy, under, this, system, of, government, is, a, powerful, political, and, social, institution, by, contrast, in, ceremonial, monarchies, the, monarch, holds, little, or, no, actual, power, or, direct, political, influence, though, they, frequently, still, have, a, great, deal, of, social, and, cultural, influence, ceremonial, and, executive, monarchy, should, not, be, confused, with, democratic, and, non, democratic, monarchical, systems, for, example, in, liechtenstein, and, monaco, the, ruling, monarchs, wield, significant, executive, power, however, while, they, are, theoretically, very, powerful, within, their, small, states, they, are, not, absolute, monarchs, and, have, very, limited, de, facto, power, compared, to, the, islamic, monarchs, which, is, why, their, countries, are, generally, considered, to, be, liberal, democracies, and, not, undemocratic, for, instance, when, hereditary, prince, alois, of, liechtenstein, threatened, to, veto, a, possible, approval, of, a, referendum, to, legalize, abortion, in, 2011, it, came, as, a, surprise, because, the, prince, had, not, vetoed, any, law, for, over, 30, years, in, the, end, this, was, moot, as, the, proposal, was, not, approved, as, originally, conceived, a, constitutional, monarch, was, head, of, the, executive, branch, and, quite, a, powerful, figure, even, though, their, power, was, limited, by, the, constitution, and, the, elected, parliament, some, of, the, framers, of, the, u, s, constitution, may, have, envisioned, the, president, as, an, elected, constitutional, monarch, as, the, term, was, then, understood, following, montesquieu, s, account, of, the, separation, of, powers, the, present, day, concept, of, a, constitutional, monarchy, developed, in, the, united, kingdom, where, they, democratically, elected, parliaments, and, their, leader, the, prime, minister, exercise, power, with, the, monarchs, having, ceded, power, and, remaining, as, a, titular, position, in, many, cases, the, monarchs, while, still, at, the, very, top, of, the, political, and, social, hierarchy, were, given, the, status, of, servants, of, the, people, to, reflect, the, new, egalitarian, position, in, the, course, of, france, s, july, monarchy, louis, philippe, i, was, styled, king, of, the, french, rather, than, king, of, france, following, the, unification, of, germany, otto, von, bismarck, rejected, the, british, model, in, the, constitutional, monarchy, established, under, the, constitution, of, the, german, empire, which, bismarck, inspired, the, kaiser, retained, considerable, actual, executive, power, while, the, imperial, chancellor, needed, no, parliamentary, vote, of, confidence, and, ruled, solely, by, the, imperial, mandate, however, this, model, of, constitutional, monarchy, was, discredited, and, abolished, following, germany, s, defeat, in, the, first, world, war, later, fascist, italy, could, also, be, considered, a, constitutional, monarchy, in, that, there, was, a, king, as, the, titular, head, of, state, while, actual, power, was, held, by, benito, mussolini, under, a, constitution, this, eventually, discredited, the, italian, monarchy, and, led, to, its, abolition, in, 1946, after, the, second, world, war, surviving, european, monarchies, almost, invariably, adopted, some, variant, of, the, constitutional, monarchy, model, originally, developed, in, britain, nowadays, a, parliamentary, democracy, that, is, a, constitutional, monarchy, is, considered, to, differ, from, one, that, is, a, republic, only, in, detail, rather, than, in, substance, in, both, cases, the, titular, head, of, state, monarch, or, president, serves, the, traditional, role, of, embodying, and, representing, the, nation, while, the, government, is, carried, on, by, a, cabinet, composed, predominantly, of, elected, members, of, parliament, however, three, important, factors, distinguish, monarchies, such, as, the, united, kingdom, from, systems, where, greater, power, might, otherwise, rest, with, parliament, these, are, other, privileges, may, be, nominal, or, ceremonial, e, g, where, the, executive, judiciary, police, or, armed, forces, act, on, the, authority, of, or, owe, allegiance, to, the, crown, today, slightly, more, than, a, quarter, of, constitutional, monarchies, are, western, european, countries, including, the, united, kingdom, spain, the, netherlands, belgium, norway, denmark, luxembourg, monaco, liechtenstein, and, sweden, however, the, two, most, populous, constitutional, monarchies, in, the, world, are, in, asia, japan, and, thailand, in, these, countries, the, prime, minister, holds, the, day, to, day, powers, of, governance, while, the, monarch, retains, residual, but, not, always, insignificant, powers, the, powers, of, the, monarch, differ, between, countries, in, denmark, and, in, belgium, for, example, the, monarch, formally, appoints, a, representative, to, preside, over, the, creation, of, a, coalition, government, following, a, parliamentary, election, while, in, norway, the, king, chairs, special, meetings, of, the, cabinet, in, nearly, all, cases, the, monarch, is, still, the, nominal, chief, executive, but, is, bound, by, convention, to, act, on, the, advice, of, the, cabinet, however, a, few, monarchies, most, notably, japan, and, sweden, have, amended, their, constitutions, so, that, the, monarch, is, no, longer, the, nominal, chief, executive, there, are, fifteen, constitutional, monarchies, under, king, charles, iii, which, are, known, as, commonwealth, realms, unlike, some, of, their, continental, european, counterparts, the, monarch, and, his, governors, general, in, the, commonwealth, realms, hold, significant, reserve, or, prerogative, powers, to, be, wielded, in, times, of, extreme, emergency, or, constitutional, crises, usually, to, uphold, parliamentary, government, for, example, during, the, 1975, australian, constitutional, crisis, the, governor, general, dismissed, the, australian, prime, minister, gough, whitlam, the, australian, senate, had, threatened, to, block, the, government, s, budget, by, refusing, to, pass, the, necessary, appropriation, bills, on, 11, november, 1975, whitlam, intended, to, call, a, half, senate, election, to, try, to, break, the, deadlock, when, he, sought, the, governor, general, s, approval, of, the, election, the, governor, general, instead, dismissed, him, as, prime, minister, shortly, after, that, he, installed, leader, of, the, opposition, malcolm, fraser, in, his, place, acting, quickly, before, all, parliamentarians, became, aware, of, the, government, change, fraser, and, his, allies, secured, passage, of, the, appropriation, bills, and, the, governor, general, dissolved, parliament, for, a, double, dissolution, election, fraser, and, his, government, were, returned, with, a, massive, majority, this, led, to, much, speculation, among, whitlam, s, supporters, as, to, whether, this, use, of, the, governor, general, s, reserve, powers, was, appropriate, and, whether, australia, should, become, a, republic, among, supporters, of, constitutional, monarchy, however, the, event, confirmed, the, monarchy, s, value, as, a, source, of, checks, and, balances, against, elected, politicians, who, might, seek, powers, in, excess, of, those, conferred, by, the, constitution, and, ultimately, as, a, safeguard, against, dictatorship, in, thailand, s, constitutional, monarchy, the, monarch, is, recognized, as, the, head, of, state, head, of, the, armed, forces, upholder, of, the, buddhist, religion, and, defender, of, the, faith, the, immediate, former, king, bhumibol, adulyadej, was, the, longest, reigning, monarch, in, the, world, and, in, all, of, thailand, s, history, before, passing, away, on, 13, october, 2016, bhumibol, reigned, through, several, political, changes, in, the, thai, government, he, played, an, influential, role, in, each, incident, often, acting, as, mediator, between, disputing, political, opponents, see, bhumibol, s, role, in, thai, politics, among, the, powers, retained, by, the, thai, monarch, under, the, constitution, l, se, majest, protects, the, image, of, the, monarch, and, enables, him, to, play, a, role, in, politics, it, carries, strict, criminal, penalties, for, violators, generally, the, thai, people, were, reverent, of, bhumibol, much, of, his, social, influence, arose, from, this, reverence, and, from, the, socioeconomic, improvement, efforts, undertaken, by, the, royal, family, in, the, united, kingdom, a, frequent, debate, centres, on, when, it, is, appropriate, for, a, british, monarch, to, act, when, a, monarch, does, act, political, controversy, can, often, ensue, partially, because, the, neutrality, of, the, crown, is, seen, to, be, compromised, in, favour, of, a, partisan, goal, while, some, political, scientists, champion, the, idea, of, an, interventionist, monarch, as, a, check, against, possible, illegal, action, by, politicians, for, instance, the, monarch, of, the, united, kingdom, can, theoretically, exercise, an, absolute, veto, over, legislation, by, withholding, royal, assent, however, no, monarch, has, done, so, since, 1708, and, it, is, widely, believed, that, this, and, many, of, the, monarch, s, other, political, powers, are, lapsed, powers, there, are, currently, 43, monarchies, worldwide
