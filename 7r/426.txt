over, more, than, 1, 400, years, bengali, literature, with, its, millennium, old, literary, history, was, extensively, developed, during, the, bengali, renaissance, and, is, one, of, the, most, prolific, and, diverse, literary, traditions, in, asia, the, bengali, language, movement, from, 1948, to, 1956, demanding, that, bengali, be, an, official, language, of, pakistan, fostered, bengali, nationalism, in, east, bengal, leading, to, the, emergence, of, bangladesh, in, 1971, in, 1999, unesco, recognised, 21, february, as, international, mother, language, day, in, recognition, of, the, language, movement, although, sanskrit, has, been, spoken, by, hindu, brahmins, in, bengal, since, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, local, buddhist, population, spoke, varieties, of, the, prakrit, these, varieties, are, generally, referred, to, as, eastern, magadhi, prakrit, as, coined, by, linguist, suniti, kumar, chatterji, as, the, middle, indo, aryan, dialects, were, influential, in, the, first, millennium, when, bengal, was, a, part, of, the, greater, magadhan, realm, the, local, varieties, had, no, official, status, during, the, gupta, empire, and, with, bengal, increasingly, becoming, a, hub, of, sanskrit, literature, for, hindu, priests, the, vernacular, of, bengal, gained, a, lot, of, influence, from, sanskrit, magadhi, prakrit, was, also, spoken, in, modern, day, bihar, and, assam, and, this, vernacular, eventually, evolved, into, ardha, magadhi, ardha, magadhi, began, to, give, way, to, what, is, known, as, apabhra, a, by, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, the, bengali, language, evolved, as, a, distinct, language, over, the, course, of, time, though, some, archaeologists, claim, that, some, 10th, century, texts, were, in, bengali, it, is, not, certain, whether, they, represent, a, differentiated, language, or, whether, they, represent, a, stage, when, eastern, indo, aryan, languages, were, differentiating, the, local, apabhra, a, of, the, eastern, subcontinent, purbi, apabhra, a, or, abahatta, lit, meaningless, sounds, eventually, evolved, into, regional, dialects, which, in, turn, formed, three, groups, the, bengali, assamese, languages, the, bihari, languages, and, the, odia, language, the, language, was, not, static, different, varieties, coexisted, and, authors, often, wrote, in, multiple, dialects, in, this, period, for, example, ardhamagadhi, is, believed, to, have, evolved, into, abahatta, around, the, 6th, century, which, competed, with, the, ancestor, of, bengali, for, some, time, the, ancestor, of, bengali, was, the, language, of, the, pala, empire, and, the, sena, dynasty, during, the, medieval, period, middle, bengali, was, characterised, by, the, elision, of, the, word, final, and, the, spread, of, compound, verbs, which, originated, from, the, sanskrit, schwa, slowly, the, word, final, disappeared, from, many, words, influenced, by, the, arabic, persian, and, turkic, languages, the, arrival, of, merchants, and, traders, from, the, middle, east, and, turkestan, into, the, buddhist, ruling, pala, empire, from, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, gave, birth, to, islamic, influence, in, the, region, in, the, 13th, century, subsequent, arab, muslim, and, turco, persian, expeditions, to, bengal, heavily, influenced, the, local, vernacular, by, settling, among, the, native, population, bengali, absorbed, arabic, and, persian, influences, in, its, vocabulary, and, dialect, including, the, development, of, dobhashi, bengali, acquired, prominence, over, persian, in, the, court, of, the, sultans, of, bengal, with, the, ascent, of, jalaluddin, muhammad, shah, subsequent, muslim, rulers, actively, promoted, the, literary, development, of, bengali, allowing, it, to, become, the, most, spoken, vernacular, language, in, the, sultanate, bengali, adopted, many, words, from, arabic, and, persian, which, was, a, manifestation, of, islamic, culture, on, the, language, major, texts,

when, the, mughal, empire, conquered, bengal, in, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, century, the, modern, literary, form, of, bengali, was, developed, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, based, on, the, west, central, dialect, spoken, in, the, nadia, region, bengali, shows, a, high, degree, of, diglossia, with, the, literary, and, standard, form, differing, greatly, from, the, colloquial, speech, of, the, regions, that, identify, with, the, language, modern, bengali, vocabulary, is, based, on, words, inherited, from, magadhi, prakrit, and, pali, along, with, tatsamas, and, reborrowings, from, sanskrit, and, borrowings, from, persian, arabic, austroasiatic, languages, and, other, languages, with, which, it, has, historically, been, in, contact, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, there, were, two, standard, forms, of, written, bengali, in, 1948, the, government, of, pakistan, tried, to, impose, urdu, as, the, sole, state, language, in, pakistan, giving, rise, to, the, bengali, language, movement, this, was, a, popular, ethnolinguistic, movement, in, the, former, east, bengal, today, bangladesh, which, arose, as, a, result, of, the, strong, linguistic, consciousness, of, the, bengalis, and, their, desire, to, promote, and, protect, spoken, and, written, bengali, s, recognition, as, a, state, language, of, the, then, dominion, of, pakistan, on, 21, february, 1952, five, students, and, political, activists, were, killed, during, protests, near, the, campus, of, the, university, of, dhaka, they, were, the, first, ever, martyrs, to, die, for, their, right, to, speak, their, mother, tongue, in, 1956, bengali, was, made, a, state, language, of, pakistan, 21, february, has, since, been, observed, as, language, movement, day, in, bangladesh,

west, bengal, proposed, that, bengali, be, made, an, official, un, language, as, of, january, 2023, no, further, action, has, been, yet, taken, on, this, matter, however, in, 2022, the, un, did, adopt, bangla, as, an, unofficial, language, after, a, resolution, tabled, by, india, approximate, distribution, of, native, bengali, speakers, assuming, a, rounded, total, of, 280, million,

chandra, chatterjee, was, adopted, as, the, national, song, of, india, in, both, the, colonial, period, and, later, in, 1950, in, independent, india, furthermore, it, is, believed, by, many, that, the, national, anthem, of, sri, lanka, sri, lanka, matha, was, inspired, by, a, bengali, poem, written, by, rabindranath, tagore, while, some, even, believe, the, anthem, was, originally, written, in, bengali, and, then, translated, into, sinhala, after, the, contribution, made, by, the, bangladesh, un, peacekeeping, force, in, the, sierra, leone, civil, war, under, the, united, nations, mission, in, sierra, leone, the, government, of, ahmad, tejan, kabbah, declared, bengali, as, an, honorary, official, language, in, december, 2002, in, 2009, elected, representatives, in, both, bangladesh, and, west, bengal, called, for, bengali, to, be, made, an, official, language, of, the, united, nations, regional, varieties, in, spoken, bengali, constitute, a, dialect, continuum, linguist, suniti, kumar, chatterji, grouped, the, dialects, of, bengali, language, into, four, large, clusters, rarhi, vangiya, kamrupi, and, varendri, but, many, alternative, grouping, schemes, have, also, been, proposed, the, south, western, dialects, rarhi, or, nadia, dialect, form, the, basis, of, modern, standard, colloquial, bengali, in, the, dialects, prevalent, in, much, of, eastern, and, south, eastern, bangladesh, barisal, chittagong, dhaka, and, sylhet, divisions, of, bangladesh, many, of, the, stops, and, affricates, heard, in, west, bengal, and, western, bangladesh, are, pronounced, as, fricatives, western, alveolo, palatal, affricates, correspond, to, eastern, the, influence, of, tibeto, burman, languages, on, the, phonology, of, eastern, bengali, is, seen, through, the, lack, of, nasalised, vowels, and, an, alveolar, articulation, of, what, are, categorised, as, the, cerebral, consonants, as, opposed, to, the, postalveolar, articulation, of, western, bengal, some, varieties, of, bengali, particularly, sylheti, chittagonian, and, chakma, have, contrastive, tone, differences, in, the, pitch, of, the, speaker, s, voice, can, distinguish, words, kharia, thar, and, mal, paharia, are, closely, related, to, western, bengali, dialects, but, are, typically, classified, as, separate, languages, similarly, hajong, is, considered, a, separate, language, although, it, shares, similarities, to, northern, bengali, dialects, during, the, standardisation, of, bengali, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, the, cultural, centre, of, bengal, was, in, kolkata, a, city, founded, by, the, british, what, is, accepted, as, the, standard, form, today, in, both, west, bengal, and, bangladesh, is, based, on, the, west, central, dialect, of, nadia, and, kushtia, district, there, are, cases, where, speakers, of, standard, bengali, in, west, bengal, will, use, a, different, word, from, a, speaker, of, standard, bengali, in, bangladesh, even, though, both, words, are, of, native, bengali, descent, for, example, the, word, salt, is, l, b, in, the, east, which, corresponds, to, nun, in, the, west, bengali, exhibits, diglossia, though, some, scholars, have, proposed, triglossia, or, even, n, glossia, or, heteroglossia, between, the, written, and, spoken, forms, of, the, language, two, styles, of, writing, have, emerged, involving, somewhat, different, vocabularies, and, syntax, linguist, prabhat, ranjan, sarkar, categorises, the, language, as, while, most, writing, is, in, standard, colloquial, bengali, scb, spoken, dialects, exhibit, a, greater, variety, people, in, southeastern, west, bengal, including, kolkata, speak, in, scb, other, dialects, with, minor, variations, from, standard, colloquial, are, used, in, other, parts, of, west, bengal, and, western, bangladesh, such, as, the, midnapore, dialect, characterised, by, some, unique, words, and, constructions, however, a, majority, in, bangladesh, speaks, dialects, notably, different, from, scb, some, dialects, particularly, those, of, the, chittagong, region, bear, only, a, superficial, resemblance, to, scb, the, dialect, in, the, chittagong, region, is, least, widely, understood, by, the, general, body, of, bengalis, the, majority, of, bengalis, are, able, to, communicate, in, more, than, one, variety, often, speakers, are, fluent, in, cholitobhasha, scb, and, one, or, more, regional, dialects, even, in, scb, the, vocabulary, may, differ, according, to, the, speaker, s, religion, muslims, are, more, likely, to, use, words, of, persian, and, arabic, origin, along, with, more, words, naturally, derived, from, sanskrit, tadbhava, whereas, hindus, are, more, likely, to, use, tatsama, words, directly, borrowed, from, sanskrit, for, example, the, phonemic, inventory, of, standard, bengali, consists, of, 29, consonants, and, 7, vowels, as, well, as, 7, nasalised, vowels, the, inventory, is, set, out, below, in, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, upper, grapheme, in, each, box, and, romanisation, lower, grapheme, bengali, is, known, for, its, wide, variety, of, diphthongs, combinations, of, vowels, occurring, within, the, same, syllable, two, of, these, oi, and, ou, are, the, only, ones, with, representation, in, script, as, and, respectively, e, i, o, u, may, all, form, the, glide, part, of, a, diphthong, the, total, number, of, diphthongs, is, not, established, with, bounds, at, 17, and, 31, an, incomplete, chart, is, given, by, sarkar, 1985, of, the, following, in, standard, bengali, stress, is, predominantly, initial, bengali, words, are, virtually, all, trochaic, the, primary, stress, falls, on, the, initial, syllable, of, the, word, while, secondary, stress, often, falls, on, all, odd, numbered, syllables, thereafter, giving, strings, such, as, in, sh, h, jo, gi, ta, cooperation, where, the, boldface, represents, primary, and, secondary, stress, native, bengali, words, do, not, allow, initial, consonant, clusters, the, maximum, syllabic, structure, is, cvc, i, e, one, vowel, flanked, by, a, consonant, on, each, side, many, speakers, of, bengali, restrict, their, phonology, to, this, pattern, even, when, using, sanskrit, or, english, borrowings, such, as, geram, cv, cvc, for, gram, ccvc, village, or, iskul, vc, cvc, for, skul, ccvc, school, the, bengali, assamese, script, is, an, abugida, a, script, with, letters, for, consonants, with, diacritics, for, vowels, and, in, which, an, inherent, vowel, is, assumed, for, consonants, if, no, vowel, is, marked, the, bengali, alphabet, is, used, throughout, bangladesh, and, eastern, india, assam, west, bengal, tripura, the, bengali, alphabet, is, believed, to, have, evolved, from, a, modified, brahmic, script, around, 1000, ce, or, 10th, 11th, century, it, is, a, cursive, script, with, eleven, graphemes, or, signs, denoting, nine, vowels, and, two, diphthongs, and, thirty, nine, graphemes, representing, consonants, and, other, modifiers, there, are, no, distinct, upper, and, lower, case, letter, forms, the, letters, run, from, left, to, right, and, spaces, are, used, to, separate, orthographic, words, bengali, script, has, a, distinctive, horizontal, line, running, along, the, tops, of, the, graphemes, that, links, them, together, called, matra, since, the, bengali, script, is, an, abugida, its, consonant, graphemes, usually, do, not, represent, phonetic, segments, but, carry, an, inherent, vowel, and, thus, are, syllabic, in, nature, the, inherent, vowel, is, usually, a, back, vowel, either, as, in, opinion, or, as, in, mind, with, variants, like, the, more, open, to, emphatically, represent, a, consonant, sound, without, any, inherent, vowel, attached, to, it, a, special, diacritic, called, the, h, s, nt, may, be, added, below, the, basic, consonant, grapheme, as, in, this, diacritic, however, is, not, common, and, is, chiefly, employed, as, a, guide, to, pronunciation, the, abugida, nature, of, bengali, consonant, graphemes, is, not, consistent, however, often, syllable, final, consonant, graphemes, though, not, marked, by, a, h, s, nt, may, carry, no, inherent, vowel, sound, as, in, the, final, in, or, the, medial, in, a, consonant, sound, followed, by, some, vowel, sound, other, than, the, inherent, is, orthographically, realised, by, using, a, variety, of, vowel, allographs, above, below, before, after, or, around, the, consonant, sign, thus, forming, the, ubiquitous, consonant, vowel, typographic, ligatures, these, allographs, called, kar, are, diacritical, vowel, forms, and, cannot, stand, on, their, own, for, example, the, graph, represents, the, consonant, followed, by, the, vowel, where, is, represented, as, the, diacritical, allograph, called, i, kar, and, is, placed, before, the, default, consonant, sign, similarly, the, graphs, and, represent, the, same, consonant, combined, with, seven, other, vowels, and, two, diphthongs, in, these, consonant, vowel, ligatures, the, so, called, inherent, vowel, is, first, expunged, from, the, consonant, before, adding, the, vowel, but, this, intermediate, expulsion, of, the, inherent, vowel, is, not, indicated, in, any, visual, manner, on, the, basic, consonant, sign, the, vowel, graphemes, in, bengali, can, take, two, forms, the, independent, form, found, in, the, basic, inventory, of, the, script, and, the, dependent, abridged, allograph, form, as, discussed, above, to, represent, a, vowel, in, isolation, from, any, preceding, or, following, consonant, the, independent, form, of, the, vowel, is, used, for, example, in, ladder, and, in, hilsa, fish, the, independent, form, of, the, vowel, is, used, cf, the, dependent, form, a, vowel, at, the, beginning, of, a, word, is, always, realised, using, its, independent, form, in, addition, to, the, inherent, vowel, suppressing, h, s, nt, three, more, diacritics, are, commonly, used, in, bengali, these, are, the, superposed, ch, ndr, bindu, denoting, a, suprasegmental, for, nasalisation, of, vowels, as, in, moon, the, postposed, nusbar, indicating, the, velar, nasal, as, in, bengali, and, the, postposed, bis, rg, indicating, the, voiceless, glottal, fricative, as, in, ouch, or, the, gemination, of, the, following, consonant, as, in, sorrow, the, bengali, consonant, clusters, jukt, b, nj, n, are, usually, realised, as, ligatures, where, the, consonant, which, comes, first, is, put, on, top, of, or, to, the, left, of, the, one, that, immediately, follows, in, these, ligatures, the, shapes, of, the, constituent, consonant, signs, are, often, contracted, and, sometimes, even, distorted, beyond, recognition, in, the, bengali, writing, system, there, are, nearly, 285, such, ligatures, denoting, consonant, clusters, although, there, exist, a, few, visual, formulas, to, construct, some, of, these, ligatures, many, of, them, have, to, be, learned, by, rote, recently, in, a, bid, to, lessen, this, burden, on, young, learners, efforts, have, been, made, by, educational, institutions, in, the, two, main, bengali, speaking, regions, west, bengal, and, bangladesh, to, address, the, opaque, nature, of, many, consonant, clusters, and, as, a, result, modern, bengali, textbooks, are, beginning, to, contain, more, and, more, transparent, graphical, forms, of, consonant, clusters, in, which, the, constituent, consonants, of, a, cluster, are, readily, apparent, from, the, graphical, form, however, since, this, change, is, not, as, widespread, and, is, not, being, followed, as, uniformly, in, the, rest, of, the, bengali, printed, literature, today, s, bengali, learning, children, will, possibly, have, to, learn, to, recognise, both, the, new, transparent, and, the, old, opaque, forms, which, ultimately, amounts, to, an, increase, in, learning, burden, bengali, punctuation, marks, apart, from, the, downstroke, da, i, the, bengali, equivalent, of, a, full, stop, have, been, adopted, from, western, scripts, and, their, usage, is, similar, unlike, in, western, scripts, latin, cyrillic, etc, where, the, letter, forms, stand, on, an, invisible, baseline, the, bengali, letter, forms, instead, hang, from, a, visible, horizontal, left, to, right, headstroke, called, matra, the, presence, and, absence, of, this, matra, can, be, important, for, example, the, letter, t, and, the, numeral, 3, are, distinguishable, only, by, the, presence, or, absence, of, the, matra, as, is, the, case, between, the, consonant, cluster, tr, and, the, independent, vowel, e, also, the, letter, h, and, bengali, bogroho, and, letter, o, and, consonant, cluster, tt, the, letter, forms, also, employ, the, concepts, of, letter, width, and, letter, height, the, vertical, space, between, the, visible, matra, and, an, invisible, baseline, there, is, yet, to, be, a, uniform, standard, collating, sequence, sorting, order, of, graphemes, to, be, used, in, dictionaries, indices, computer, sorting, programs, etc, of, bengali, graphemes, experts, in, both, bangladesh, and, india, are, currently, working, towards, a, common, solution, for, this, problem, throughout, history, there, have, been, instances, of, the, bengali, language, being, written, in, different, scripts, though, these, employments, were, never, popular, on, a, large, scale, and, were, communally, limited, owing, to, bengal, s, geographic, location, bengali, areas, bordering, non, bengali, regions, have, been, influenced, by, each, other, small, numbers, of, people, in, midnapore, which, borders, odisha, have, used, the, odia, script, to, write, in, bengali, in, the, border, areas, between, west, bengal, and, bihar, some, bengali, communities, historically, wrote, bengali, in, devanagari, kaithi, and, tirhuta, in, sylhet, and, bankura, modified, versions, of, the, kaithi, script, had, some, historical, prominence, mainly, among, muslim, communities, the, variant, in, sylhet, was, identical, to, the, baitali, kaithi, script, of, hindustani, with, the, exception, of, sylhet, nagri, possessing, matra, sylhet, nagri, was, standardised, for, printing, in, c, 1869, up, until, the, 19th, century, numerous, variations, of, the, arabic, script, had, been, used, across, bengal, from, chittagong, in, the, east, to, meherpur, in, the, west, the, 14th, century, court, scholar, of, bengal, nur, qutb, alam, composed, bengali, poetry, using, the, persian, alphabet, after, the, partition, of, india, in, the, 20th, century, the, pakistani, government, attempted, to, institute, the, perso, arabic, script, as, the, standard, for, bengali, in, east, pakistan, this, was, met, with, resistance, and, contributed, to, the, bengali, language, movement, in, the, 16th, century, portuguese, missionaries, began, a, tradition, of, using, the, roman, alphabet, to, transcribe, the, bengali, language, though, the, portuguese, standard, did, not, receive, much, growth, a, few, roman, bengali, works, relating, to, christianity, and, bengali, grammar, were, printed, as, far, as, lisbon, in, 1743, the, portuguese, were, followed, by, the, english, and, french, respectively, whose, works, were, mostly, related, to, bengali, grammar, and, transliteration, the, first, version, of, the, aesop, s, fables, in, bengali, was, printed, using, roman, letters, based, on, english, phonology, by, the, scottish, linguist, john, gilchrist, consecutive, attempts, to, establish, a, roman, bengali, have, continued, across, every, century, since, these, times, and, have, been, supported, by, the, likes, of, suniti, kumar, chatterji, muhammad, qudrat, i, khuda, and, muhammad, enamul, haq, the, digital, revolution, has, also, played, a, part, in, the, adoption, of, the, english, alphabet, to, write, bengali, with, certain, social, media, influencers, publishing, entire, novels, in, roman, bengali, bengali, script, like, others, does, have, schwa, deletion, it, does, not, mark, when, the, inherent, vowel, is, not, used, mainly, at, the, end, of, words, the, bengali, script, in, general, has, a, comparatively, shallow, orthography, when, compared, to, the, latin, script, used, for, english, and, french, i, e, in, many, cases, there, is, a, one, to, one, correspondence, between, the, sounds, phonemes, and, the, letters, graphemes, of, bengali, but, grapheme, phoneme, inconsistencies, do, occur, in, many, other, cases, in, fact, bengali, assamese, script, has, the, deepest, orthography, deep, orthography, among, the, indian, scripts, in, general, the, bengali, assamese, script, is, fairly, transparent, for, grapheme, to, phoneme, conversion, i, e, it, is, easier, to, predict, the, pronunciation, from, spelling, of, the, words, but, the, script, is, fairly, opaque, for, phoneme, to, grapheme, conversion, i, e, it, is, more, difficult, to, predict, the, spelling, from, the, pronunciation, of, the, words, one, kind, of, inconsistency, is, due, to, the, presence, of, several, letters, in, the, script, for, the, same, sound, in, spite, of, some, modifications, in, the, 19th, century, the, bengali, spelling, system, continues, to, be, based, on, the, one, used, for, sanskrit, and, thus, does, not, take, into, account, some, sound, mergers, that, have, occurred, in, the, spoken, language, for, example, there, are, three, letters, and, for, the, voiceless, postalveolar, fricative, although, the, letter, retains, the, voiceless, alveolar, sibilant, sound, when, used, in, certain, consonant, conjuncts, as, in, fall, beat, etc, the, letter, also, sometimes, retains, the, voiceless, retroflex, sibilant, sound, when, used, in, certain, consonant, conjuncts, as, in, suffering, clan, etc, similarly, there, are, two, letters, and, for, the, voiced, postalveolar, affricate, moreover, what, was, once, pronounced, and, written, as, a, retroflex, nasal, is, now, pronounced, as, an, alveolar, when, in, conversation, the, difference, is, heard, when, reading, unless, conjoined, with, another, retroflex, consonant, such, as, and, although, the, spelling, does, not, reflect, this, change, the, near, open, front, unrounded, vowel, is, orthographically, realised, by, multiple, means, as, seen, in, the, following, examples, so, much, academy, amoeba, to, see, busy, grammar, another, kind, of, inconsistency, is, concerned, with, the, incomplete, coverage, of, phonological, information, in, the, script, the, inherent, vowel, attached, to, every, consonant, can, be, either, or, depending, on, vowel, harmony, with, the, preceding, or, following, vowel, or, on, the, context, but, this, phonological, information, is, not, captured, by, the, script, creating, ambiguity, for, the, reader, furthermore, the, inherent, vowel, is, often, not, pronounced, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, as, in, less, but, this, omission, is, not, generally, reflected, in, the, script, making, it, difficult, for, the, new, reader, many, consonant, clusters, have, different, sounds, than, their, constituent, consonants, for, example, the, combination, of, the, consonants, and, is, graphically, realised, as, and, is, pronounced, as, in, coarse, as, in, capability, or, even, as, in, harm, depending, on, the, position, of, the, cluster, in, a, word, another, example, is, that, there, are, around, 7, or, more, graphemes, to, represent, the, sound, these, are, as, in, shabda, pronounced, as, sh, bdo, meaning, word, as, in, a, jantra, pronounced, as, sh, ojontro, meaning, conspiracy, as, in, sark, ra, pronounced, as, sh, rk, r, meaning, government, as, in, written, as, shbashura, but, pronounced, with, the, b, silent, i, e, as, shoshur, meaning, father, in, law, as, in, written, as, shmash, na, but, pronounced, with, the, m, silent, i, e, as, sh, sh, n, meaning, crematorium, as, in, written, as, sbapna, but, pronounced, with, the, b, silent, i, e, as, sh, pno, meaning, dream, as, in, written, as, smara, a, but, pronounced, with, the, m, silent, i, e, as, sh, ron, meaning, remember, as, in, written, as, gr, ma, but, pronounced, with, the, m, silent, i, e, as, gr, shsho, meaning, summer, and, so, on, in, most, of, the, consonant, clusters, only, the, first, consonant, is, pronounced, and, rest, of, the, consonants, are, silent, examples, are, written, as, lak, ma, a, but, pronounced, as, l, kkhon, lord, rama, s, brother, in, the, hindu, epic, ramayana, written, as, bishb, sa, but, pronounced, as, bishsh, sh, belief, written, as, b, dhja, but, pronounced, as, b, ddho, bound, to, do, something, and, written, as, sb, sthja, but, pronounced, as, sh, stho, health, some, consonant, clusters, have, completely, different, pronunciation, as, compared, to, the, constituent, consonants, for, example, as, in, where, hy, is, pronounced, as, jjh, written, as, aiti, hy, a, but, pronounced, as, oiti, jjh, o, tradition, the, same, is, pronounced, as, h, as, in, written, as, hj, but, pronounced, as, nasalised, h, another, example, of, inconsistency, in, the, script, is, that, of, words, like, written, as, anja, but, pronounced, as, onno, other, different, and, written, as, ann, a, but, pronounced, as, nno, food, grain, in, these, words, the, letter, is, combining, with, two, different, consonant, clusters, nja, and, nna, and, while, the, same, letter, has, two, different, pronunciations, o, and, the, two, different, consonant, clusters, have, the, same, pronunciation, nno, thus, same, letters, and, graphemes, can, often, have, different, pronunciations, depending, on, their, position, in, a, word, and, different, graphemes, and, letters, often, have, the, same, pronunciation, the, main, reason, for, these, numerous, inconsistencies, is, that, there, have, been, lots, of, sound, mergers, in, bengali, but, the, script, has, failed, to, account, for, the, sound, shifts, and, consonant, mergers, in, the, language, bengali, has, lots, of, tatsam, words, words, directly, derived, from, sanskrit, and, in, all, these, words, the, original, spelling, has, been, preserved, but, the, pronunciations, have, changed, due, to, consonant, mergers, and, sound, shifts, in, fact, most, of, the, tatsam, words, have, a, lot, of, grapheme, to, phoneme, inconsistencies, while, most, of, the, tadbhav, words, native, bengali, words, have, fairly, consistent, grapheme, to, phoneme, correspondence, the, bengali, writing, system, is, therefore, not, often, a, true, guide, to, pronunciation, the, script, used, for, bengali, assamese, and, other, languages, is, known, as, bengali, script, the, script, is, known, as, the, bengali, alphabet, for, bengali, and, its, dialects, and, the, assamese, alphabet, for, assamese, language, with, some, minor, variations, other, related, languages, in, the, nearby, region, also, make, use, of, the, bengali, script, like, the, meitei, language, in, the, indian, state, of, manipur, where, the, meitei, language, has, been, written, in, the, bengali, script, for, centuries, though, the, meitei, script, has, been, promoted, in, recent, times, bengali, digits, are, as, follows, there, are, additional, digits, for, fractions, and, prices, though, they, are, little, used, any, longer, there, are, various, romanisation, systems, used, for, bengali, created, in, recent, years, which, have, failed, to, represent, the, true, bengali, phonetic, sound, the, bengali, alphabet, has, often, been, included, with, the, group, of, brahmic, scripts, for, romanisation, where, the, true, phonetic, value, of, bengali, is, never, represented, some, of, them, are, the, international, alphabet, of, sanskrit, transliteration, or, iast, system, based, on, diacritics, indian, languages, transliteration, or, itrans, uses, upper, case, letters, suited, for, ascii, keyboards, and, the, national, library, at, kolkata, romanisation, in, the, context, of, bengali, romanisation, it, is, important, to, distinguish, transliteration, from, transcription, transliteration, is, orthographically, accurate, i, e, the, original, spelling, can, be, recovered, whereas, transcription, is, phonetically, accurate, the, pronunciation, can, be, reproduced, as, the, spelling, often, doesn, t, reflect, the, actual, pronunciation, transliteration, and, transcription, are, often, different, although, it, might, be, desirable, to, use, a, transliteration, scheme, where, the, original, bengali, orthography, is, recoverable, from, the, latin, text, bengali, words, are, currently, romanised, on, wikipedia, using, a, phonemic, transcription, where, the, true, phonetic, pronunciation, of, bengali, is, represented, with, no, reference, to, how, it, is, written, the, most, recent, attempt, has, been, by, publishers, mitra, and, ghosh, with, the, launch, of, three, popular, children, s, books, abol, tabol, hasi, khusi, and, sahoj, path, in, roman, script, at, the, kolkata, book, fair, 2018, published, under, the, imprint, of, benglish, books, these, are, based, on, phonetic, transliteration, and, closely, follow, spellings, used, in, social, media, but, for, using, an, underline, to, describe, soft, consonants, bengali, nouns, are, not, assigned, gender, which, leads, to, minimal, changing, of, adjectives, inflection, however, nouns, and, pronouns, are, moderately, declined, altered, depending, on, their, function, in, a, sentence, into, four, cases, while, verbs, are, heavily, conjugated, and, the, verbs, do, not, change, form, depending, on, the, gender, of, the, nouns, as, a, head, final, language, bengali, follows, a, subject, object, verb, word, order, although, variations, on, this, theme, are, common, bengali, makes, use, of, postpositions, as, opposed, to, the, prepositions, used, in, english, and, other, european, languages, determiners, follow, the, noun, while, numerals, adjectives, and, possessors, precede, the, noun, yes, no, questions, do, not, require, any, change, to, the, basic, word, order, instead, the, low, l, tone, of, the, final, syllable, in, the, utterance, is, replaced, with, a, falling, hl, tone, additionally, optional, particles, e, g, ki, na, etc, are, often, encliticised, onto, the, first, or, last, word, of, a, yes, no, question, wh, questions, are, formed, by, fronting, the, wh, word, to, focus, position, which, is, typically, the, first, or, second, word, in, the, utterance, nouns, and, pronouns, are, inflected, for, case, including, nominative, objective, genitive, possessive, and, locative, the, case, marking, pattern, for, each, noun, being, inflected, depends, on, the, noun, s, degree, of, animacy, when, a, definite, article, such, as, a, singular, or, gulo, plural, is, added, as, in, the, tables, below, nouns, are, also, inflected, for, number, in, most, of, bengali, grammar, books, cases, are, divided, into, 6, categories, and, an, additional, possessive, case, the, possessive, form, is, not, recognised, as, a, type, of, case, by, bengali, grammarians, but, in, terms, of, usage, cases, are, generally, grouped, into, only, 4, categories, chatr, i, chatr, i, the, student, chatr, ra, chatr, ra, the, students, juto, a, juto, a, the, shoe, juta, gula, juto, gulo,

nouns, in, bengali, cannot, be, counted, by, adding, the, numeral, directly, adjacent, to, the, noun, an, appropriate, measure, word, mw, a, classifier, must, be, used, between, the, numeral, and, the, noun, most, languages, of, the, mainland, southeast, asia, linguistic, area, are, similar, in, this, respect, most, nouns, take, the, generic, measure, word, a, though, other, measure, words, indicate, semantic, classes, e, g, j, n, for, humans, there, is, also, the, classifier, khana, and, its, diminutive, form, khani, which, attaches, only, to, nouns, denoting, something, flat, long, square, or, thin, these, are, the, least, common, of, the, classifiers, n, y, a, nine, mw, goru, cow, n, y, a, goru, nine, mw, cow, nine, cows, k, y, a, how, many, mw, balish, pillow, k, y, a, balish,

k, four, five, mw, teacher, four, to, five, teachers, measuring, nouns, in, bengali, without, their, corresponding, measure, words, e, g, a, bi, al, instead, of, a, a, bi, al, eight, cats, would, typically, be, considered, ungrammatical, however, when, the, semantic, class, of, the, noun, is, understood, from, the, measure, word, the, noun, is, often, omitted, and, only, the, measure, word, is, used, e, g, shudhu, k, j, n, thakbe, lit, only, one, mw, will, remain, would, be, understood, to, mean, only, one, person, will, remain, given, the, semantic, class, implicit, in, j, n, in, this, sense, all, nouns, in, bengali, unlike, most, other, indo, european, languages, are, similar, to, mass, nouns, there, are, two, classes, of, verbs, finite, and, non, finite, non, finite, verbs, have, no, inflection, for, tense, or, person, while, finite, verbs, are, fully, inflected, for, person, first, second, third, tense, present, past, future, aspect, simple, perfect, progressive, and, honour, intimate, familiar, and, formal, but, not, for, number, conditional, imperative, and, other, special, inflections, for, mood, can, replace, the, tense, and, aspect, suffixes, the, number, of, inflections, on, many, verb, roots, can, total, more, than, 200, inflectional, suffixes, in, the, morphology, of, bengali, vary, from, region, to, region, along, with, minor, differences, in, syntax, bengali, differs, from, most, indo, aryan, languages, in, the, zero, copula, where, the, copula, or, connective, be, is, often, missing, in, the, present, tense, thus, he, is, a, teacher, is, se, shikkh, k, literally, he, teacher, in, this, respect, bengali, is, similar, to, russian, and, hungarian, romani, grammar, is, also, the, closest, to, bengali, grammar, origins, of, words, in, the, bengali, language, bengali, is, typically, thought, to, have, around, 100, 000, separate, words, of, which, 16, 000, 16, are, considered, to, be, t, dbh, b, or, tadbhava, inherited, indo, aryan, vocabulary, 40, 000, 40, are, t, t, m, or, tatsama, words, directly, borrowed, from, sanskrit, and, borrowings, from, de, i, or, indigenous, words, which, are, at, around, 16, 000, 16, of, the, bengali, vocabulary, the, rest, are, bide, i, or, foreign, sources, including, persian, turkish, arabic, and, english, among, others, accounting, for, around, 28, 000, 28, of, all, bengali, words, highlighting, the, significant, influence, that, foreign, languages, and, cultures, have, had, on, the, bengali, language, throughout, bengal, s, long, history, of, contact, with, different, peoples, and, the, cultural, exchanges, that, came, with, such, interactions, bengali, is, reportedly, similar, to, assamese, and, has, a, lexical, similarity, of, 40, per, cent, with, nepali, however, these, figures, do, not, take, into, account, the, large, proportion, of, archaic, or, highly, technical, words, that, are, very, rarely, used, furthermore, different, dialects, use, more, persian, and, arabic, vocabulary, especially, in, different, areas, of, bangladesh, and, muslim, majority, areas, of, west, bengal, hindus, on, the, other, hand, use, more, sanskrit, vocabulary, than, muslims, standard, bengali, is, based, on, the, nadia, dialect, spoken, in, the, hindu, majority, states, of, west, bengal, and, parts, of, the, muslim, majority, division, of, khulna, in, bangladesh, about, 90, of, bengalis, in, bangladesh, ca, 148, million, and, 27, of, bengalis, in, west, bengal, and, 10, in, assam, ca, 36, million, are, muslim, and, the, bangladeshi, muslims, and, some, of, the, indian, bengali, muslims, speak, a, more, perso, arabised, version, of, bengali, instead, of, the, more, sanskrit, influenced, standard, nadia, dialect, although, the, majority, of, the, indian, bengalis, of, west, bengal, speaks, in, rarhi, dialect, irrespective, of, religion, according, to, suniti, kumar, chatterji, dictionaries, from, the, early, 20th, century, attributed, a, little, more, than, 50, of, the, bengali, vocabulary, to, native, words, i, e, naturally, modified, sanskrit, words, corrupted, forms, of, sanskrit, words, and, loanwords, non, indo, european, languages, about, 45, per, cent, of, bengali, words, are, unmodified, sanskrit, and, the, remaining, words, are, from, foreign, languages, however, more, modern, sources, cite, that, this, is, not, the, case, with, bengali, vocabulary, as, there, are, far, more, dominant, foreign, influences, that, accurately, reflect, the, way, modern, bengalis, speak, and, utilize, bengali, persian, is, also, thought, to, have, influenced, a, lot, of, grammatical, forms, more, recent, studies, suggest, that, the, use, of, foreign, words, has, been, increasing, mainly, because, of, the, preference, of, bengali, speakers, for, the, colloquial, style, because, of, centuries, of, contact, with, europeans, turkic, peoples, and, persians, bengali, has, absorbed, numerous, words, from, foreign, languages, often, totally, integrating, these, borrowings, into, the, core, vocabulary, persian, influence, was, significant, for, the, development, of, bengali, up, to, the, modern, day, and, was, the, primary, official, language, in, the, region, for, 600, years, until, british, rule, when, it, was, changed, to, english, in, 1836, in, fact, there, was, so, much, persian, influence, that, a, register, of, highly, persianized, bengali, known, as, dobhashi, appeared, in, medieval, bengal, the, most, common, borrowings, from, foreign, languages, come, from, three, different, kinds, of, contact, after, close, contact, with, several, indigenous, austroasiatic, languages, and, later, the, delhi, sultanate, the, bengal, sultanate, and, the, mughal, empire, whose, court, language, was, persian, numerous, arabic, persian, and, chaghatai, words, were, absorbed, into, the, lexicon, later, east, asian, travellers, and, lately, european, colonialism, brought, words, from, portuguese, french, dutch, and, most, significantly, english, during, the, colonial, period, the, following, is, a, sample, text, in, bengali, of, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, s, m, st,
