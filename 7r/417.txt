old, church, slavonic, or, old, slavonic, s, l, v, n, k, s, l, v, n, sl, von, ik, slav, on, is, the, first, slavic, literary, language, historians, credit, the, 9th, century, byzantine, missionaries, saints, cyril, and, methodius, with, standardizing, the, language, and, undertaking, the, task, of, translating, the, gospels, and, necessary, liturgical, books, into, it, as, part, of, the, christianization, of, the, slavs, it, is, thought, to, have, been, based, primarily, on, the, dialect, of, the, 9th, century, byzantine, slavs, living, in, the, province, of, thessalonica, in, present, day, greece, old, church, slavonic, played, an, important, role, in, the, history, of, the, slavic, languages, and, served, as, a, basis, and, model, for, later, church, slavonic, traditions, and, some, eastern, orthodox, and, eastern, catholic, churches, use, this, later, church, slavonic, as, a, liturgical, language, to, this, day, as, the, oldest, attested, slavic, language, ocs, provides, important, evidence, for, the, features, of, proto, slavic, the, reconstructed, common, ancestor, of, all, slavic, languages, the, name, of, the, language, in, old, church, slavonic, texts, was, simply, slavic, slov, n, sk, j, zyk, derived, from, the, word, for, slavs, slov, ne, the, self, designation, of, the, compilers, of, the, texts, this, name, is, preserved, in, the, modern, native, names, of, the, slovak, and, slovene, languages, the, language, is, sometimes, called, old, slavic, which, may, be, confused, with, the, distinct, proto, slavic, language, bulgarian, croatian, macedonian, serbian, slovene, and, slovak, linguists, have, claimed, old, church, slavonic, thus, ocs, has, also, been, variously, called, old, bulgarian, old, croatian, old, macedonian, or, old, serbian, or, even, old, slovak, old, slovenian, the, commonly, accepted, terms, in, modern, english, language, slavic, studies, are, old, church, slavonic, and, old, church, slavic, the, term, old, bulgarian, bulgarian, german, altbulgarisch, is, the, designation, used, by, most, bulgarian, language, writers, it, was, used, in, numerous, 19th, century, sources, e, g, by, august, schleicher, martin, hattala, leopold, geitler, and, august, leskien, who, noted, similarities, between, the, first, literary, slavic, works, and, the, modern, bulgarian, language, for, similar, reasons, russian, linguist, aleksandr, vostokov, used, the, term, slav, bulgarian, the, term, is, still, used, by, some, writers, but, nowadays, normally, avoided, in, favor, of, old, church, slavonic, the, term, old, macedonian, is, occasionally, used, by, western, scholars, in, a, regional, context, according, to, slavist, henrik, birnbaum, the, term, was, introduced, mostly, by, macedonian, scholars, and, it, is, anachronistic, because, there, was, no, separate, macedonian, language, distinguished, from, early, bulgarian, in, the, ninth, century, the, obsolete, term, old, slovenian, was, used, by, early, 19th, century, scholars, who, conjectured, that, the, language, was, based, on, the, dialect, of, pannonia, it, is, generally, held, that, the, language, was, standardized, by, two, byzantine, missionaries, cyril, and, his, brother, methodius, for, a, mission, to, great, moravia, the, territory, of, today, s, eastern, czech, republic, and, western, slovakia, for, details, see, glagolitic, alphabet, the, mission, took, place, in, response, to, a, request, by, great, moravia, s, ruler, duke, rastislav, for, the, development, of, slavonic, liturgy, as, part, of, preparations, for, the, mission, in, 862, 863, the, missionaries, developed, the, glagolitic, alphabet, and, translated, the, most, important, prayers, and, liturgical, books, including, the, aprakos, evangeliar, the, psalter, and, the, acts, of, the, apostles, allegedly, basing, the, language, on, the, slavic, dialect, spoken, in, the, hinterland, of, their, hometown, thessaloniki, in, present, day, greece, based, on, a, number, of, archaicisms, preserved, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, articulation, of, yat, as, in, boboshtic, drenov, around, thessaloniki, razlog, the, rhodopes, and, thrace, and, of, yery, as, around, castoria, and, the, rhodopes, the, presence, of, decomposed, nasalisms, around, castoria, and, thessaloniki, etc, the, dialect, is, posited, to, have, been, part, of, a, macrodialect, extending, from, the, adriatic, to, the, black, sea, and, covering, southern, albania, northern, greece, and, the, southernmost, parts, of, bulgaria, because, of, the, very, short, time, between, rastislav, s, request, and, the, actual, mission, it, has, been, widely, suggested, that, both, the, glagolitic, alphabet, and, the, translations, had, been, in, the, works, for, some, time, probably, for, a, planned, mission, to, the, bulgaria, the, language, and, the, glagolitic, alphabet, as, taught, at, the, great, moravian, academy, slovak, ve, komoravsk, u, ili, te, were, used, for, government, and, religious, documents, and, books, in, great, moravia, between, 863, and, 885, the, texts, written, during, this, phase, contain, characteristics, of, the, west, slavic, vernaculars, in, great, moravia, in, 885, pope, stephen, v, prohibited, the, use, of, old, church, slavonic, in, great, moravia, in, favour, of, latin, king, svatopluk, i, of, great, moravia, expelled, the, byzantine, missionary, contingent, in, 886, exiled, students, of, the, two, apostles, then, brought, the, glagolitic, alphabet, to, the, bulgarian, empire, being, at, least, some, of, them, bulgarians, themselves, boris, i, of, bulgaria, r, 852, 889, received, and, officially, accepted, them, he, established, the, preslav, literary, school, and, the, ohrid, literary, school, both, schools, originally, used, the, glagolitic, alphabet, though, the, cyrillic, script, developed, early, on, at, the, preslav, literary, school, where, it, superseded, glagolitic, as, official, in, bulgaria, in, 893, the, texts, written, during, this, era, exhibit, certain, linguistic, features, of, the, vernaculars, of, the, first, bulgarian, empire, old, church, slavonic, spread, to, other, south, eastern, central, and, eastern, european, slavic, territories, most, notably, croatia, serbia, bohemia, lesser, poland, and, principalities, of, the, kievan, rus, while, retaining, characteristically, eastern, south, slavic, linguistic, features, later, texts, written, in, each, of, those, territories, began, to, take, on, characteristics, of, the, local, slavic, vernaculars, and, by, the, mid, 11th, century, old, church, slavonic, had, diversified, into, a, number, of, regional, varieties, known, as, recensions, these, local, varieties, are, collectively, known, as, the, church, slavonic, language, apart, from, use, in, the, slavic, countries, old, church, slavonic, served, as, a, liturgical, language, in, the, romanian, orthodox, church, and, also, as, a, literary, and, official, language, of, the, princedoms, of, wallachia, and, moldavia, see, old, church, slavonic, in, romania, before, gradually, being, replaced, by, romanian, during, the, 16th, to, 17th, centuries, church, slavonic, maintained, a, prestigious, status, particularly, in, russia, for, many, centuries, among, slavs, in, the, east, it, had, a, status, analogous, to, that, of, latin, in, western, europe, but, had, the, advantage, of, being, substantially, less, divergent, from, the, vernacular, tongues, of, average, parishioners, some, orthodox, churches, such, as, the, bulgarian, orthodox, church, russian, orthodox, church, serbian, orthodox, church, ukrainian, orthodox, church, and, macedonian, orthodox, church, ohrid, archbishopric, as, well, as, several, eastern, catholic, churches, still, use, church, slavonic, in, their, services, and, chants, initially, old, church, slavonic, was, written, with, the, glagolitic, alphabet, but, later, glagolitic, was, replaced, by, cyrillic, which, was, developed, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, by, a, decree, of, boris, i, of, bulgaria, in, the, 9th, century, of, the, old, church, slavonic, canon, about, two, thirds, is, written, in, glagolitic, the, local, serbian, cyrillic, alphabet, known, as, srbin, ica, was, preserved, in, serbia, and, parts, of, croatia, while, a, variant, of, the, angular, glagolitic, alphabet, was, preserved, in, croatia, see, early, cyrillic, alphabet, for, a, detailed, description, of, the, script, and, information, about, the, sounds, it, originally, expressed, for, old, church, slavonic, the, following, segments, are, reconstructible, a, few, sounds, are, given, in, slavic, transliterated, form, rather, than, in, ipa, as, the, exact, realisation, is, uncertain, and, often, differs, depending, on, the, area, that, a, text, originated, from, for, english, equivalents, and, narrow, transcriptions, of, sounds, see, old, church, slavonic, pronunciation, on, wiktionary, for, english, equivalents, and, narrow, transcriptions, of, sounds, see, old, church, slavonic, pronunciation, on, wiktionary, several, notable, constraints, on, the, distribution, of, the, phonemes, can, be, identified, mostly, resulting, from, the, tendencies, occurring, within, the, common, slavic, period, such, as, intrasyllabic, synharmony, and, the, law, of, open, syllables, for, consonant, and, vowel, clusters, and, sequences, of, a, consonant, and, a, vowel, the, following, constraints, can, be, ascertained, as, a, result, of, the, first, and, the, second, slavic, palatalizations, velars,

georgian, orthodox, church, semi, autonomous, written, evidence, of, old, church, slavonic, survives, in, a, relatively, small, body, of, manuscripts, most, of, them, written, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, during, the, late, 10th, and, the, early, 11th, centuries, the, language, has, an, eastern, south, slavic, basis, in, the, bulgarian, macedonian, dialectal, area, with, an, admixture, of, western, slavic, moravian, features, inherited, during, the, mission, of, saints, cyril, and, methodius, to, great, moravia, 863, 885, the, only, well, preserved, manuscript, of, the, moravian, recension, the, kiev, missal, or, the, kiev, folia, is, characterised, by, the, replacement, of, some, south, slavic, phonetic, and, lexical, features, with, western, slavic, ones, manuscripts, written, in, the, second, bulgarian, empire, 1185, 1396, have, on, the, other, hand, few, western, slavic, features, though, south, slavic, in, phonology, and, morphology, old, church, slavonic, was, influenced, by, byzantine, greek, in, syntax, and, style, and, is, characterized, by, complex, subordinate, sentence, structures, and, participial, constructions, a, large, body, of, complex, polymorphemic, words, was, coined, first, by, saint, cyril, himself, and, then, by, his, students, at, the, academies, in, great, moravia, and, the, first, bulgarian, empire, to, denote, complex, abstract, and, religious, terms, e, g, z, lod, jan, je, from, evil, do, noun, suffix, i, e, evil, deed, a, significant, part, of, them, w, r, calqued, directly, from, greek, old, church, slavonic, is, valuable, to, historical, linguists, since, it, preserves, archaic, features, believed, to, have, once, been, common, to, all, slavic, languages, such, as, old, church, slavonic, is, also, likely, to, have, preserved, an, extremely, archaic, type, of, accentuation, probably, close, to, the, chakavian, dialect, of, modern, serbo, croatian, but, unfortunately, no, accent, marks, appear, in, the, written, manuscripts, the, south, slavic, and, eastern, south, slavic, nature, of, the, language, is, evident, from, the, following, variations, old, church, slavonic, also, shares, the, following, phonetic, features, only, with, bulgarian, over, time, the, language, adopted, more, and, more, features, from, local, slavic, vernaculars, producing, different, variants, referred, to, as, recensions, or, redactions, modern, convention, differentiates, between, the, earliest, classical, form, of, the, language, referred, to, as, old, church, slavonic, and, later, vernacular, coloured, forms, collectively, designated, as, church, slavonic, more, specifically, old, church, slavonic, is, exemplified, by, extant, manuscripts, written, between, the, 9th, and, 11th, century, in, great, moravia, and, the, first, bulgarian, empire, the, language, was, standardized, for, the, first, time, by, the, mission, of, the, two, apostles, to, great, moravia, from, 863, the, manuscripts, of, the, moravian, recension, are, therefore, the, earliest, dated, of, the, ocs, recensions, the, recension, takes, its, name, from, the, slavic, state, of, great, moravia, which, existed, in, central, europe, during, the, 9th, century, on, the, territory, of, today, s, czech, republic, slovakia, hungary, northern, austria, and, southeastern, poland, this, recension, is, exemplified, by, the, kiev, missal, its, linguistic, characteristics, include, the, bohemian, czech, recension, is, derived, from, the, moravian, recension, and, was, used, in, the, czech, lands, until, 1097, it, was, written, in, glagolitic, which, is, posited, to, have, been, carried, over, to, bohemia, even, before, the, death, of, methodius, it, is, preserved, in, religious, texts, e, g, prague, fragments, legends, and, glosses, and, shows, substantial, influence, of, the, western, slavic, vernacular, in, bohemia, at, the, time, its, main, features, are, although, the, missionary, work, of, constantine, and, methodius, took, place, in, great, moravia, it, was, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, that, early, slavic, written, culture, and, liturgical, literature, really, flourished, the, old, church, slavonic, language, was, adopted, as, state, and, liturgical, language, in, 893, and, was, taught, and, refined, further, in, two, bespoke, academies, created, in, preslav, bulgarian, capital, between, 893, and, 972, and, ohrid, bulgarian, capital, between, 991, 997, and, 1015, the, language, did, not, represent, one, regional, dialect, but, a, generalized, form, of, early, eastern, south, slavic, which, cannot, be, localized, the, existence, of, two, major, literary, centres, in, the, empire, led, in, the, period, from, the, 9th, to, the, 11th, centuries, to, the, emergence, of, two, recensions, otherwise, called, redactions, termed, eastern, and, western, respectively, some, researchers, do, not, differentiate, between, manuscripts, of, the, two, recensions, preferring, to, group, them, together, in, a, macedo, bulgarian, or, simply, bulgarian, recension, the, development, of, old, church, slavonic, literacy, had, the, effect, of, preventing, the, assimilation, of, the, south, slavs, into, neighboring, cultures, which, promoted, the, formation, of, a, distinct, bulgarian, identity, common, features, of, both, recensions, moreover, consistent, scribal, errors, indicate, the, following, trends, in, the, development, of, the, recension, s, between, the, 9th, and, the, 11th, centuries, there, are, also, certain, differences, between, the, preslav, and, ohrid, recensions, according, to, huntley, the, primary, ones, are, the, diverging, development, of, the, strong, yers, western, o, and, eastern, and, and, the, palatalization, of, dentals, and, labials, before, front, vowels, in, east, but, not, west, these, continue, to, be, among, the, primary, differences, between, eastern, bulgarian, and, western, bulgarian, macedonian, to, this, day, moreover, two, different, styles, or, redactions, can, be, distinguished, at, preslav, preslav, double, yer, and, preslav, single, yer, usually, the, preslav, and, ohrid, recensions, are, described, in, greater, detail, below, the, manuscripts, of, the, preslav, recension, or, eastern, variant, are, among, the, oldest, of, the, old, church, slavonic, language, only, predated, by, the, moravian, recension, this, recension, was, centred, around, the, preslav, literary, school, since, the, earliest, datable, cyrillic, inscriptions, were, found, in, the, area, of, preslav, it, is, this, school, which, is, credited, with, the, development, of, the, cyrillic, alphabet, which, gradually, replaced, the, glagolitic, one, a, number, of, prominent, bulgarian, writers, and, scholars, worked, at, the, preslav, literary, school, including, naum, of, preslav, until, 893, constantine, of, preslav, john, exarch, chernorizets, hrabar, etc, the, main, linguistic, features, of, this, recension, are, the, following, the, manuscripts, of, the, ohrid, recension, or, western, variant, are, among, the, oldest, of, the, old, church, slavonic, language, only, predated, by, the, moravian, recension, the, recension, is, sometimes, named, macedonian, because, its, literary, centre, ohrid, lies, in, the, historical, region, of, macedonia, at, that, period, ohrid, administratively, formed, part, of, the, province, of, kutmichevitsa, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, until, the, byzantine, conquest, the, main, literary, centre, of, this, dialect, was, the, ohrid, literary, school, whose, most, prominent, member, and, most, likely, founder, was, saint, clement, of, ohrid, who, was, commissioned, by, boris, i, of, bulgaria, to, teach, and, instruct, the, future, clergy, of, the, state, in, the, slavonic, language, this, recension, is, represented, by, the, codex, zographensis, and, marianus, among, others, the, main, linguistic, features, of, this, recension, include, old, church, slavonic, may, have, reached, slovenia, as, early, as, cyril, and, methodius, s, panonian, mission, in, 868, and, is, exemplified, by, the, late, 10th, century, freising, fragments, written, in, the, latin, script, later, in, the, 10th, century, glagolitic, liturgy, was, carried, from, bohemia, to, croatia, where, it, established, a, rich, literary, tradition, old, church, slavonic, in, the, cyrillic, script, was, in, turn, transmitted, from, bulgaria, to, serbia, in, the, 10th, century, and, to, kievan, rus, in, connection, with, its, adoption, of, orthodox, christianity, in, 988, the, later, use, of, old, church, slavonic, in, these, medieval, slavic, polities, resulted, in, a, gradual, adjustment, of, the, language, to, the, local, vernacular, while, still, retaining, a, number, of, eastern, south, slavic, moravian, or, bulgarian, features, in, all, cases, yuses, denasalised, so, that, only, old, church, slavonic, modern, polish, and, some, isolated, bulgarian, dialects, retained, the, old, slavonic, nasal, vowels, in, addition, to, the, czech, moravian, recension, which, became, moribund, in, the, late, 1000s, four, other, major, recensions, can, be, identified, middle, bulgarian, as, a, continuation, of, the, literary, tradition, of, the, preslav, and, ohrid, literary, schools, croatian, serbian, and, russian, certain, authors, also, talk, about, separate, bosnian, and, ruthenian, recensions, whereas, the, use, of, the, bulgarian, euthimian, recension, in, wallachia, and, moldova, from, the, late, 1300s, until, the, early, 1700s, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, daco, slavonic, or, dacian, recension, all, of, these, later, versions, of, old, church, slavonic, are, collectively, referred, to, as, church, slavonic, the, disputed, bosnian, recension, used, both, the, glagolitic, alphabet, and, the, cyrillic, alphabet, a, disputed, home, grown, version, of, the, cyrillic, alphabet, commonly, known, as, bosan, ica, or, bosnian, cyrillic, coined, as, neologism, in, 19th, century, emerged, very, early, on, probably, the, 1000s, primary, features, the, recension, is, sometimes, subsumed, under, the, serbian, recension, especially, by, serbian, linguistics, and, along, with, bosan, ica, is, generally, the, subject, of, a, tug, of, war, between, serbs, croatians, and, bosniaks, the, common, term, middle, bulgarian, is, usually, contrasted, to, old, bulgarian, an, alternative, name, for, old, church, slavonic, and, loosely, used, for, manuscripts, whose, language, demonstrates, a, broad, spectrum, of, regional, and, temporal, dialect, features, after, the, 11th, century, 12th, to, 14th, century, although, alternative, periodisation, exists, as, well, an, alternative, term, bulgarian, recension, of, church, slavonic, is, used, by, some, authors, the, period, is, generally, defined, as, a, transition, from, the, synthetic, old, bulgarian, to, the, highly, analytic, new, bulgarian, and, macedonian, where, incipient, 10th, century, analytisms, gradually, spread, from, the, north, east, to, all, bulgarian, macedonian, dialects, and, torlak, primary, features, phonological, morphological, in, the, early, 1370s, bulgarian, patriarch, euthymius, of, tarnovo, implemented, a, reform, to, standardize, bulgarian, orthography, instead, of, bringining, the, language, closer, to, that, of, commoners, the, euthymian, or, tarnovo, recension, rather, sought, to, re, establish, older, old, church, slavonic, models, further, archaizing, it, the, fall, of, bulgaria, under, ottoman, rule, in, 1396, precipitated, an, exodus, of, bulgarian, men, of, letters, e, g, cyprian, gregory, tsamblak, constantine, of, kostenets, etc, to, wallachia, moldova, and, the, grand, duchies, of, lithuania, and, moscow, where, they, enforced, the, euthymian, recension, as, liturgical, and, chancery, language, and, to, the, serbian, despotate, where, it, influenced, the, resava, school, the, croatian, recension, of, old, church, slavonic, used, only, the, glagolitic, alphabet, of, angular, type, it, shows, the, development, of, the, following, characteristics, the, russian, recension, emerged, in, the, 1000s, based, on, the, earlier, eastern, bulgarian, recension, from, which, it, differed, slightly, the, earliest, manuscript, to, contain, russian, elements, is, the, ostromir, gospel, of, 1056, 1057, which, exemplifies, the, beginning, of, a, russianized, church, slavonic, that, gradually, spread, to, liturgical, and, chancery, documents, the, russianization, process, was, cut, short, in, the, late, 1300s, when, a, series, of, bulgarian, prelates, starting, with, cyprian, consciously, re, bulgarized, church, texts, to, achieve, maximum, conformity, with, the, euthymian, recension, the, russianization, process, resumed, in, the, late, 1400s, and, russian, church, slavonic, eventually, became, entrenched, as, standard, for, all, orthodox, slavs, incl, serbs, and, bulgarians, by, the, early, 1800s, the, ruthenian, recension, generally, shows, the, same, characteristics, as, and, is, usually, subsumed, under, the, russian, recension, the, euthymian, recension, that, was, pursued, throughout, the, 1400s, was, gradually, replaced, in, the, 1500s, by, ruthenian, an, administrative, language, based, on, the, belarusian, dialect, of, vilno, the, serbian, recension, used, both, the, glagolitic, alphabet, and, the, cyrillic, alphabet, a, home, grown, side, version, of, the, cyrillic, alphabet, commonly, known, as, srbin, ica, srbislova, or, serbian, cyrillic, emerged, very, early, on, probably, the, 9th, century, was, written, mostly, in, cyrillic, but, also, in, the, glagolitic, alphabet, depending, on, region, by, the, 12th, century, the, serbs, used, exclusively, the, cyrillic, alphabet, and, latin, script, in, coastal, areas, the, 1186, miroslav, gospels, example, belong, to, the, serbian, recension, primary, features, due, to, the, ottoman, conquest, of, bulgaria, in, 1396, serbia, saw, an, influx, of, educated, scribes, and, clergy, who, re, introduced, a, more, classical, form, that, resembled, more, closely, the, bulgarian, recension, in, the, late, 1400s, and, early, 1500s, the, resava, orthography, spread, to, bulgaria, and, north, macedonia, and, exerted, substantial, influence, on, wallachia, it, was, eventually, superseded, by, russian, church, slavonic, in, the, late, 1700s, and, early, 1800s, old, church, slavonic, was, initially, widely, intelligible, across, the, slavic, world, however, with, the, gradual, differentiation, of, individual, languages, orthodox, slavs, and, to, some, extent, croatians, ended, up, in, a, situation, of, diglossia, where, they, used, one, slavic, language, for, religious, and, another, one, for, everyday, affairs, the, resolution, of, this, situation, and, the, choice, made, for, the, exact, balance, between, old, church, slavonic, and, vernacular, elements, and, forms, is, key, to, understanding, the, relationship, between, old, church, slavonic, and, modern, slavic, literary, languages, as, well, as, the, distance, between, individual, languages, it, was, first, russian, polymath, and, grammarian, mikhail, lomonosov, that, defined, in, 1755, three, styles, to, the, balance, of, church, slavonic, and, russian, elements, in, the, russian, literary, language, a, high, style, with, substantial, old, church, slavonic, influence, for, formal, occasions, and, heroic, poems, a, low, style, with, substantial, influence, of, the, vernacular, for, comedy, prose, and, ordinary, affairs, and, a, middle, style, balancing, between, the, two, for, informal, verse, epistles, satire, etc, the, middle, slaveno, russian, style, eventually, prevailed, thus, while, standard, russian, was, codified, on, the, basis, of, the, central, russian, dialect, and, the, moscow, chancery, language, it, retains, an, entire, stylistic, layer, of, church, slavonisms, with, typically, eastern, south, slavic, phonetic, features, where, native, and, church, slavonic, terms, exist, side, by, side, the, church, slavonic, one, is, in, the, higher, stylistic, register, and, is, usually, more, abstract, e, g, the, neutral, g, oro, d, vs, the, poetic, g, r, d, town, bulgarian, faced, a, similar, dilemma, a, century, later, with, three, camps, championing, church, slavonic, slaveno, bulgarian, and, new, bulgarian, as, a, basis, for, the, codification, of, modern, bulgarian, here, the, proponents, of, the, analytic, vernacular, eventually, won, however, the, language, re, imported, a, vast, number, of, church, slavonic, forms, regarded, as, a, legacy, of, old, bulgarian, either, directly, from, russian, church, slavonic, or, through, the, mediation, of, russian, by, contrast, serbian, made, a, clean, break, with, old, church, slavonic, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1800s, as, part, of, vuk, karad, i, s, linguistic, reform, opting, instead, to, build, the, modern, serbian, language, from, the, ground, up, based, on, the, eastern, herzegovinian, dialect, ukrainian, and, belarussian, as, well, as, macedonian, took, a, similar, path, in, the, mid, and, late, 1800s, and, the, late, 1940s, respectively, the, former, two, because, of, the, association, of, old, church, slavonic, with, stifling, russian, imperial, control, and, the, latter, in, an, attempt, to, distance, the, newly, codified, language, as, further, away, from, bulgarian, as, possible, the, core, corpus, of, old, church, slavonic, manuscripts, is, usually, referred, to, as, canon, manuscripts, must, satisfy, certain, linguistic, chronological, and, cultural, criteria, to, be, incorporated, into, the, canon, they, must, not, significantly, depart, from, the, language, and, tradition, of, saints, cyril, and, methodius, usually, known, as, the, cyrillo, methodian, tradition, for, example, the, freising, fragments, dating, from, the, 10th, century, show, some, linguistic, and, cultural, traits, of, old, church, slavonic, but, they, are, usually, not, included, in, the, canon, as, some, of, the, phonological, features, of, the, writings, appear, to, belong, to, certain, pannonian, slavic, dialect, of, the, period, similarly, the, ostromir, gospels, exhibits, dialectal, features, that, classify, it, as, east, slavic, rather, than, south, slavic, so, it, is, not, included, in, the, canon, either, on, the, other, hand, the, kiev, missal, is, included, in, the, canon, even, though, it, manifests, some, west, slavic, features, and, contains, western, liturgy, because, of, the, bulgarian, linguistic, layer, and, connection, to, the, moravian, mission, manuscripts, are, usually, classified, in, two, groups, depending, on, the, alphabet, used, cyrillic, or, glagolitic, with, the, exception, of, the, kiev, missal, and, glagolita, clozianus, which, exhibit, west, slavic, and, croatian, features, respectively, all, glagolitic, texts, are, assumed, to, be, of, the, macedonian, recension, all, cyrillic, manuscripts, are, of, the, preslav, recension, preslav, literary, school, and, date, from, the, 11th, century, except, for, the, zographos, which, is, of, the, ohrid, recension, ohrid, literary, school, here, is, the, lord, s, prayer, in, old, church, slavonic, the, history, of, old, church, slavonic, writing, includes, a, northern, tradition, begun, by, the, mission, to, great, moravia, including, a, short, mission, in, the, lower, pannonia, and, a, bulgarian, tradition, begun, by, some, of, the, missionaries, who, relocated, to, bulgaria, after, the, expulsion, from, great, moravia, the, first, texts, written, in, old, church, slavonic, are, translations, of, the, gospels, and, byzantine, liturgical, texts, begun, by, the, byzantine, missionaries, saints, cyril, and, methodius, mostly, during, their, mission, to, great, moravia, the, most, important,
