its, related, holidays, are, moveable, feasts, not, falling, on, a, fixed, date, its, date, is, computed, based, on, a, lunisolar, calendar, solar, year, plus, moon, phase, similar, to, the, hebrew, calendar, generating, a, number, of, controversies, the, first, council, of, nicaea, 325, established, common, paschal, observance, by, all, christians, on, the, first, sunday, after, the, first, full, moon, on, or, after, the, vernal, equinox, even, if, calculated, on, the, basis, of, the, gregorian, calendar, the, date, of, that, full, moon, sometimes, differs, from, that, of, the, astronomical, first, full, moon, after, the, march, equinox, the, english, term, is, derived, from, the, saxon, spring, festival, ostre, easter, is, linked, to, the, jewish, passover, by, its, name, hebrew, pesach, aramaic, pascha, are, the, basis, of, the, term, pascha, by, its, origin, according, to, the, synoptic, gospels, both, the, crucifixion, and, the, resurrection, took, place, during, the, week, of, passover, and, by, much, of, its, symbolism, as, well, as, by, its, position, in, the, calendar, in, most, european, languages, both, the, christian, easter, and, the, jewish, passover, are, called, by, the, same, name, and, in, the, older, english, versions, of, the, bible, as, well, the, term, easter, was, used, to, translate, passover, easter, traditions, vary, across, the, christian, world, and, include, sunrise, services, or, late, night, vigils, exclamations, and, exchanges, of, paschal, greetings, flowering, the, cross, the, wearing, of, easter, bonnets, by, women,

easter, foods, that, vary, by, region, and, culture, the, modern, english, term, easter, cognate, with, modern, dutch, ooster, and, german, ostern, developed, from, an, old, english, word, that, usually, appears, in, the, form, astrun, astron, or, astran, but, also, as, astru, astro, and, astre, or, ostre, bede, provides, the, only, documentary, source, for, the, etymology, of, the, word, in, his, eighth, century, the, reckoning, of, time, he, wrote, that, osturm, na, old, english, for, month, of, ostre, translated, in, bede, s, time, as, paschal, month, was, an, english, month, corresponding, to, april, which, he, says, was, once, called, after, a, goddess, of, theirs, named, ostre, in, whose, honour, feasts, were, celebrated, in, that, month, in, latin, and, greek, the, christian, celebration, was, and, still, is, called, pascha, greek, a, word, derived, from, aramaic, paskha, cognate, to, the, hebrew, pesach, the, word, originally, denoted, the, jewish, festival, known, in, english, as, passover, commemorating, the, jewish, exodus, from, slavery, in, egypt, as, early, as, the, 50s, of, the, 1st, century, paul, the, apostle, writing, from, ephesus, to, the, christians, in, corinth, applied, the, term, to, christ, and, it, is, unlikely, that, the, ephesian, and, corinthian, christians, were, the, first, to, hear, exodus, 12, interpreted, as, speaking, about, the, death, of, jesus, not, just, about, the, jewish, passover, ritual, in, most, languages, the, feast, is, known, by, names, derived, from, the, greek, and, latin, pascha, pascha, is, also, a, name, by, which, jesus, himself, is, remembered, in, the, orthodox, church, especially, in, connection, with, his, resurrection, and, with, the, season, of, its, celebration, others, call, the, holiday, resurrection, sunday, or, resurrection, day, after, the, greek, anastasis, resurrection, day, easter, celebrates, jesus, supernatural, resurrection, from, the, dead, which, is, one, of, the, chief, tenets, of, the, christian, faith, paul, writes, that, for, those, who, trust, in, jesus, s, death, and, resurrection, death, is, swallowed, up, in, victory, the, first, epistle, of, peter, declares, that, god, has, given, believers, a, new, birth, into, a, living, hope, through, the, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, from, the, dead, christian, theology, holds, that, through, faith, in, the, working, of, god, those, who, follow, jesus, are, spiritually, resurrected, with, him, so, that, they, may, walk, in, a, new, way, of, life, and, receive, eternal, salvation, and, can, hope, to, be, physically, resurrected, to, dwell, with, him, in, the, kingdom, of, heaven, easter, is, linked, to, passover, and, the, exodus, from, egypt, recorded, in, the, old, testament, through, the, last, supper, sufferings, and, crucifixion, of, jesus, that, preceded, the, resurrection, according, to, the, three, synoptic, gospels, jesus, gave, the, passover, meal, a, new, meaning, as, in, the, upper, room, during, the, last, supper, he, prepared, himself, and, his, disciples, for, his, death, he, identified, the, bread, and, cup, of, wine, as, his, body, soon, to, be, sacrificed, and, his, blood, soon, to, be, shed, the, apostle, paul, states, in, his, first, epistle, to, the, corinthians, get, rid, of, the, old, yeast, that, you, may, be, a, new, batch, without, yeast, as, you, really, are, for, christ, our, passover, lamb, has, been, sacrificed, this, refers, to, the, requirement, in, jewish, law, that, jews, eliminate, all, chametz, or, leavening, from, their, homes, in, advance, of, passover, and, to, the, allegory, of, jesus, as, the, passover, lamb, as, the, gospels, assert, that, both, the, crucifixion, and, resurrection, of, jesus, occurred, during, the, week, of, passover, the, first, christians, timed, the, observance, of, the, annual, celebration, of, the, resurrection, in, relation, to, passover, direct, evidence, for, a, more, fully, formed, christian, festival, of, pascha, easter, begins, to, appear, in, the, mid, 2nd, century, perhaps, the, earliest, extant, primary, source, referring, to, easter, is, a, mid, 2nd, century, paschal, homily, attributed, to, melito, of, sardis, which, characterizes, the, celebration, as, a, well, established, one, evidence, for, another, kind, of, annually, recurring, christian, festival, those, commemorating, the, martyrs, began, to, appear, at, about, the, same, time, as, the, above, homily, while, martyrs, days, usually, the, individual, dates, of, martyrdom, were, celebrated, on, fixed, dates, in, the, local, solar, calendar, the, date, of, easter, was, fixed, by, means, of, the, local, jewish, lunisolar, calendar, this, is, consistent, with, the, celebration, of, easter, having, entered, christianity, during, its, earliest, jewish, period, but, does, not, leave, the, question, free, of, doubt, the, ecclesiastical, historian, socrates, scholasticus, attributes, the, observance, of, easter, by, the, church, to, the, perpetuation, of, pre, christian, custom, just, as, many, other, customs, have, been, established, stating, that, neither, jesus, nor, his, apostles, enjoined, the, keeping, of, this, or, any, other, festival, although, he, describes, the, details, of, the, easter, celebration, as, deriving, from, local, custom, he, insists, the, feast, itself, is, universally, observed, easter, and, the, holidays, that, are, related, to, it, are, moveable, feasts, in, that, they, do, not, fall, on, a, fixed, date, in, the, gregorian, or, julian, calendars, both, of, which, follow, the, cycle, of, the, sun, and, the, seasons, instead, the, date, for, easter, is, determined, on, a, lunisolar, calendar, similar, to, the, hebrew, calendar, the, precise, date, of, easter, has, at, times, been, a, matter, of, contention, by, the, later, 2nd, century, it, was, widely, accepted, that, the, celebration, of, the, holiday, was, a, practice, of, the, disciples, and, an, undisputed, tradition, the, quartodeciman, controversy, the, first, of, several, easter, controversies, arose, concerning, the, date, on, which, the, holiday, should, be, celebrated, the, term, quartodeciman, refers, to, the, practice, of, ending, the, lenten, fast, on, nisan, 14, of, the, hebrew, calendar, the, l, ord, s, passover, according, to, the, church, historian, eusebius, the, quartodeciman, polycarp, bishop, of, smyrna, by, tradition, a, disciple, of, john, the, apostle, debated, the, question, with, anicetus, bishop, of, rome, the, roman, province, of, asia, was, quartodeciman, while, the, roman, and, alexandrian, churches, continued, the, fast, until, the, sunday, following, the, sunday, of, unleavened, bread, wishing, to, associate, easter, with, sunday, neither, polycarp, nor, anicetus, persuaded, the, other, but, they, did, not, consider, the, matter, schismatic, either, parting, in, peace, and, leaving, the, question, unsettled, controversy, arose, when, victor, bishop, of, rome, a, generation, after, anicetus, attempted, to, excommunicate, polycrates, of, ephesus, and, all, other, bishops, of, asia, for, their, quartodecimanism, according, to, eusebius, a, number, of, synods, were, convened, to, deal, with, the, controversy, which, he, regarded, as, all, ruling, in, support, of, easter, on, sunday, polycrates, c, 190, however, wrote, to, victor, defending, the, antiquity, of, asian, quartodecimanism, victor, s, attempted, excommunication, was, apparently, rescinded, and, the, two, sides, reconciled, upon, the, intervention, of, bishop, irenaeus, and, others, who, reminded, victor, of, the, tolerant, precedent, of, anicetus, quartodecimanism, seems, to, have, lingered, into, the, 4th, century, when, socrates, of, constantinople, recorded, that, some, quartodecimans, were, deprived, of, their, churches, by, john, chrysostom, and, that, some, were, harassed, by, nestorius, it, is, not, known, how, long, the, nisan, 14, practice, continued, but, both, those, who, followed, the, nisan, 14, custom, and, those, who, set, easter, to, the, following, sunday, had, in, common, the, custom, of, consulting, their, jewish, neighbors, to, learn, when, the, month, of, nisan, would, fall, and, setting, their, festival, accordingly, by, the, later, 3rd, century, however, some, christians, began, to, express, dissatisfaction, with, the, custom, of, relying, on, the, jewish, community, to, determine, the, date, of, easter, the, chief, complaint, was, that, the, jewish, communities, sometimes, erred, in, setting, passover, to, fall, before, the, northern, hemisphere, spring, equinox, the, sardica, paschal, table, confirms, these, complaints, for, it, indicates, that, the, jews, of, some, eastern, mediterranean, city, possibly, antioch, fixed, nisan, 14, on, dates, well, before, the, spring, equinox, on, multiple, occasions, because, of, this, dissatisfaction, with, reliance, on, the, jewish, calendar, some, christians, began, to, experiment, with, independent, computations, others, however, believed, that, the, customary, practice, of, consulting, jews, should, continue, even, if, the, jewish, computations, were, in, error, the, settlement, of, the, controversy, about, the, paschal, season, caused, by, the, quartodeciman, practice, of, asian, churches, is, listed, in, our, principal, source, for, the, works, of, the, council, of, nicaea, socrates, scholasticus, s, ecclesiastical, history, as, one, of, the, two, reasons, for, which, emperor, constantine, convened, the, council, in, 325, the, canons, of, the, council, preserved, by, dionysius, exiguus, and, his, successors, do, not, include, any, relevant, provision, but, letters, of, individuals, present, at, the, council, mention, a, decision, prohibiting, quartodecimanism, and, requiring, that, all, christians, adopt, a, common, method, to, independently, determine, paschal, observance, following, the, churches, of, rome, and, alexandria, the, latter, since, there, was, among, the, egyptians, an, ancient, science, for, the, computation, already, in, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, and, later, on, dionysius, exiguus, and, others, following, him, maintained, that, the, bishops, assembled, at, nicaea, had, promulgated, the, celebration, of, easter, on, the, first, sunday, after, the, first, full, moon, on, or, after, the, vernal, equinox, and, that, they, had, adopted, the, use, of, the, 19, year, lunar, cycle, better, known, as, metonic, cycle, to, determine, the, date, subsequent, scholarship, has, refuted, this, tradition, but, with, regards, to, the, rule, of, the, equinox, evidence, that, the, church, of, alexandria, had, implemented, it, before, 325, suggests, that, the, council, of, nicaea, implicitly, endorsed, it, canons, and, sermons, condemning, the, custom, of, computing, easter, s, date, based, on, the, jewish, calendar, indicate, that, this, custom, called, protopaschite, by, historians, did, not, die, out, at, once, but, persisted, for, a, time, after, the, council, of, nicaea, in, any, case, in, the, years, following, the, council, the, computational, system, that, was, worked, out, by, the, church, of, alexandria, came, to, be, normative, the, alexandrian, system, however, was, not, immediately, adopted, throughout, christian, europe, following, augustalis, treatise, de, ratione, paschae, on, the, measurement, of, easter, rome, retired, the, earlier, 8, year, cycle, in, favor, of, augustalis, 84, year, lunisolar, calendar, cycle, which, it, used, until, 457, it, then, switched, to, victorius, of, aquitaine, s, adaptation, of, the, alexandrian, system, because, this, victorian, cycle, differed, from, the, unmodified, alexandrian, cycle, in, the, dates, of, some, of, the, paschal, full, moons, and, because, it, tried, to, respect, the, roman, custom, of, fixing, easter, to, the, sunday, in, the, week, of, the, 16th, to, the, 22nd, of, the, lunar, month, rather, than, the, 15th, to, the, 21st, as, at, alexandria, by, providing, alternative, latin, and, greek, dates, in, some, years, occasional, differences, in, the, date, of, easter, as, fixed, by, alexandrian, rules, continued, the, alexandrian, rules, were, adopted, in, the, west, following, the, tables, of, dionysius, exiguus, in, 525, early, christians, in, britain, and, ireland, also, used, an, 84, year, cycle, from, the, 5th, century, onward, this, cycle, set, its, equinox, to, 25, march, and, fixed, easter, to, the, sunday, falling, in, the, 14th, to, the, 20th, of, the, lunar, month, inclusive, this, 84, year, cycle, was, replaced, by, the, alexandrian, method, in, the, course, of, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, churches, in, western, continental, europe, used, a, late, roman, method, until, the, late, 8th, century, during, the, reign, of, charlemagne, when, they, finally, adopted, the, alexandrian, method, since, 1582, when, the, roman, catholic, church, adopted, the, gregorian, calendar, while, most, of, europe, used, the, julian, calendar, the, date, on, which, easter, is, celebrated, has, again, differed, in, 725, bede, succinctly, wrote, the, sunday, following, the, full, moon, which, falls, on, or, after, the, equinox, will, give, the, lawful, easter, however, this, does, not, precisely, reflect, the, ecclesiastical, rules, the, full, moon, referred, to, called, the, paschal, full, moon, is, not, an, astronomical, full, moon, but, the, 14th, day, of, a, lunar, month, another, difference, is, that, the, astronomical, equinox, is, a, natural, astronomical, phenomenon, which, can, fall, on, 19, 20, or, 21, march, while, the, ecclesiastical, date, is, fixed, by, convention, on, 21, march, in, addition, the, lunar, tables, of, the, julian, calendar, are, currently, five, days, behind, those, of, the, gregorian, calendar, therefore, the, julian, computation, of, the, paschal, full, moon, is, a, full, five, days, later, than, the, astronomical, full, moon, the, result, of, this, combination, of, solar, and, lunar, discrepancies, is, divergence, in, the, date, of, easter, in, most, years, see, table, easter, is, determined, on, the, basis, of, lunisolar, cycles, the, lunar, year, consists, of, 30, day, and, 29, day, lunar, months, generally, alternating, with, an, embolismic, month, added, periodically, to, bring, the, lunar, cycle, into, line, with, the, solar, cycle, in, each, solar, year, 1, january, to, 31, december, inclusive, the, lunar, month, beginning, with, an, ecclesiastical, new, moon, falling, in, the, 29, day, period, from, 8, march, to, 5, april, inclusive, is, designated, as, the, paschal, lunar, month, for, that, year, easter, is, the, third, sunday, in, the, paschal, lunar, month, or, in, other, words, the, sunday, after, the, paschal, lunar, month, s, 14th, day, the, 14th, of, the, paschal, lunar, month, is, designated, by, convention, as, the, paschal, full, moon, although, the, 14th, of, the, lunar, month, may, differ, from, the, date, of, the, astronomical, full, moon, by, up, to, two, days, since, the, ecclesiastical, new, moon, falls, on, a, date, from, 8, march, to, 5, april, inclusive, the, paschal, full, moon, the, 14th, of, that, lunar, month, must, fall, on, a, date, from, 22, march, to, 18, april, inclusive, the, gregorian, calculation, of, easter, was, based, on, a, method, devised, by, the, calabrian, doctor, aloysius, lilius, or, lilio, for, adjusting, the, epacts, of, the, moon, and, has, been, adopted, by, almost, all, western, christians, and, by, western, countries, which, celebrate, national, holidays, at, easter, for, the, british, empire, and, colonies, a, determination, of, the, date, of, easter, sunday, using, golden, numbers, and, sunday, letters, was, defined, by, the, calendar, new, style, act, 1750, with, its, annexe, this, was, designed, to, match, exactly, the, gregorian, calculation, in, western, christianity, using, the, gregorian, calendar, easter, always, falls, on, a, sunday, between, 22, march, and, 25, april, within, about, seven, days, after, the, astronomical, full, moon, the, preceding, friday, good, friday, and, following, monday, easter, monday, are, legal, holidays, in, many, countries, with, predominantly, christian, traditions, eastern, orthodox, christians, use, the, same, rule, but, base, their, 21, march, according, to, the, julian, calendar, because, of, the, thirteen, day, difference, between, the, calendars, from, 1900, through, 2099, 21, march, julian, corresponds, to, 3, april, in, the, gregorian, calendar, during, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, consequently, the, date, of, orthodox, easter, varies, between, 4, april, and, 8, may, in, the, gregorian, calendar, orthodox, easter, is, usually, several, days, or, more, than, a, month, later, than, western, easter, among, the, oriental, orthodox, some, churches, have, changed, from, the, julian, to, the, gregorian, calendar, and, the, date, for, easter, as, for, other, fixed, and, moveable, feasts, is, the, same, as, in, the, western, church, the, greek, island, of, syros, whose, population, is, divided, almost, equally, between, catholics, and, orthodox, is, one, of, the, few, places, where, the, two, churches, share, a, common, date, for, easter, with, the, catholics, accepting, the, orthodox, date, a, practice, helping, considerably, in, maintaining, good, relations, between, the, two, communities, conversely, orthodox, christians, in, finland, celebrate, easter, according, to, the, western, christian, date, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, some, individuals, and, institutions, have, propounded, changing, the, method, of, calculating, the, date, for, easter, the, most, prominent, proposal, being, the, sunday, after, the, second, saturday, in, april, despite, having, some, support, proposals, to, reform, the, date, have, not, been, implemented, an, orthodox, congress, of, eastern, orthodox, bishops, which, included, representatives, mostly, from, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, and, the, serbian, patriarch, met, in, constantinople, in, 1923, where, the, bishops, agreed, to, the, revised, julian, calendar, the, original, form, of, this, calendar, would, have, determined, easter, using, precise, astronomical, calculations, based, on, the, meridian, of, jerusalem, however, all, the, eastern, orthodox, countries, that, subsequently, adopted, the, revised, julian, calendar, adopted, only, that, part, of, the, revised, calendar, that, applied, to, festivals, falling, on, fixed, dates, in, the, julian, calendar, the, revised, easter, computation, that, had, been, part, of, the, original, 1923, agreement, was, never, permanently, implemented, in, any, orthodox, diocese, in, the, united, kingdom, parliament, passed, the, easter, act, 1928, to, change, the, date, of, easter, to, be, the, first, sunday, after, the, second, saturday, in, april, or, in, other, words, the, sunday, in, the, period, from, 9, to, 15, april, however, the, legislation, has, not, been, implemented, although, it, remains, on, the, statute, book, and, could, be, implemented, subject, to, approval, by, the, various, christian, churches, at, a, summit, in, aleppo, syria, in, 1997, the, world, council, of, churches, wcc, proposed, a, reform, in, the, calculation, of, easter, which, would, have, replaced, the, present, divergent, practices, of, calculating, easter, with, modern, scientific, knowledge, taking, into, account, actual, astronomical, instances, of, the, spring, equinox, and, full, moon, based, on, the, meridian, of, jerusalem, while, also, following, the, tradition, of, easter, being, on, the, sunday, following, the, full, moon, the, recommended, world, council, of, churches, changes, would, have, sidestepped, the, calendar, issues, and, eliminated, the, difference, in, date, between, the, eastern, and, western, churches, the, reform, was, proposed, for, implementation, starting, in, 2001, and, despite, repeated, calls, for, reform, it, was, not, ultimately, adopted, by, any, member, body, in, january, 2016, the, anglican, communion, coptic, orthodox, church, greek, orthodox, church, and, roman, catholic, church, again, considered, agreeing, on, a, common, universal, date, for, easter, while, also, simplifying, the, calculation, of, that, date, with, either, the, second, or, third, sunday, in, april, being, popular, choices, in, november, 2022, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, said, that, conversations, between, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, orthodox, churches, had, begun, to, determine, a, common, date, for, the, celebration, of, easter, the, agreement, is, expected, to, be, reached, for, the, 1700th, anniversary, of, the, council, of, nicaea, in, 2025, the, wcc, presented, comparative, data, of, the, relationships, in, most, branches, of, western, christianity, easter, is, preceded, by, lent, a, period, of, penitence, that, begins, on, ash, wednesday, lasts, 40, days, not, counting, sundays, and, is, often, marked, with, fasting, the, week, before, easter, known, as, holy, week, is, an, important, time, for, observers, to, commemorate, the, final, week, of, jesus, life, on, earth, the, sunday, before, easter, is, palm, sunday, with, the, wednesday, before, easter, being, known, as, spy, wednesday, or, holy, wednesday, the, last, three, days, before, easter, are, maundy, thursday, good, friday, and, holy, saturday, sometimes, referred, to, as, silent, saturday, palm, sunday, maundy, thursday, and, good, friday, respectively, commemorate, jesus, s, entry, in, jerusalem, the, last, supper, and, the, crucifixion, maundy, thursday, good, friday, and,
