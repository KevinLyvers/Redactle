military, science, is, the, study, of, military, processes, institutions, and, behavior, along, with, the, study, of, warfare, and, the, theory, and, application, of, organized, coercive, force, it, is, mainly, focused, on, theory, method, and, practice, of, producing, military, capability, in, a, manner, consistent, with, national, defense, policy, military, science, serves, to, identify, the, strategic, political, economic, psychological, social, operational, technological, and, tactical, elements, necessary, to, sustain, relative, advantage, of, military, force, and, to, increase, the, likelihood, and, favorable, outcomes, of, victory, in, peace, or, during, a, war, military, scientists, include, theorists, researchers, experimental, scientists, applied, scientists, designers, engineers, test, technicians, and, other, military, personnel, military, personnel, obtain, weapons, equipment, and, training, to, achieve, specific, strategic, goals, military, science, is, also, used, to, establish, enemy, capability, as, part, of, technical, intelligence, in, military, history, military, science, had, been, used, during, the, period, of, industrial, revolution, as, a, general, term, to, refer, to, all, matters, of, military, theory, and, technology, application, as, a, single, academic, discipline, including, that, of, the, deployment, and, employment, of, troops, in, peacetime, or, in, battle, in, military, education, military, science, is, often, the, name, of, the, department, in, the, education, institution, that, administers, officer, candidate, education, however, this, education, usually, focuses, on, the, officer, leadership, training, and, basic, information, about, employment, of, military, theories, concepts, methods, and, systems, and, graduates, are, not, military, scientists, on, completion, of, studies, but, rather, junior, military, officers, even, until, the, second, world, war, military, science, was, written, in, english, starting, with, capital, letters, and, was, thought, of, as, an, academic, discipline, alongside, physics, philosophy, and, the, medical, sciences, in, part, this, was, due, to, the, general, mystique, that, accompanied, education, in, a, world, where, as, late, as, the, 1880s, 75, of, the, european, population, was, illiterate, the, ability, by, the, officers, to, make, complex, calculations, required, for, the, equally, complex, evolutions, of, the, troop, movements, in, linear, warfare, that, increasingly, dominated, the, renaissance, and, later, history, and, the, introduction, of, the, gunpowder, weapons, into, the, equation, of, warfare, only, added, to, the, veritable, arcana, of, building, fortifications, as, it, seemed, to, the, average, individual, until, the, early, 19th, century, one, observer, a, british, veteran, of, the, napoleonic, wars, major, john, mitchell, thought, that, it, seemed, nothing, much, had, changed, from, the, application, of, force, on, a, battlefield, since, the, days, of, the, greeks, he, suggested, that, this, was, primarily, so, because, as, clausewitz, suggested, unlike, in, any, other, science, or, art, in, war, the, object, reacts, until, this, time, and, even, after, the, franco, prussian, war, military, science, continued, to, be, divided, between, the, formal, thinking, of, officers, brought, up, in, the, shadow, of, the, napoleonic, wars, and, younger, officers, like, ardant, du, picq, who, tended, to, view, fighting, performance, as, rooted, in, the, individual, s, and, group, psychology, and, suggested, detailed, analysis, of, this, this, set, in, motion, the, eventual, fascination, of, the, military, organisations, with, application, of, quantitative, and, qualitative, research, to, their, theories, of, combat, the, attempt, to, translate, military, thinking, as, philosophic, concepts, into, concrete, methods, of, combat, military, implements, the, supply, of, an, army, its, organization, tactics, and, discipline, have, constituted, the, elements, of, military, science, in, all, ages, but, improvement, in, weapons, and, accoutrements, appears, to, lead, and, control, all, the, rest, the, breakthrough, of, sorts, made, by, clausewitz, in, suggesting, eight, principles, on, which, such, methods, can, be, based, in, europe, for, the, first, time, presented, an, opportunity, to, largely, remove, the, element, of, chance, and, error, from, command, decision, making, process, at, this, time, emphasis, was, made, on, the, topography, including, trigonometry, military, art, military, science, military, history, organisation, of, the, army, in, the, field, artillery, and, the, science, of, projectiles, field, fortifications, and, permanent, fortifications, military, legislation, military, administration, and, manoeuvres, the, military, science, on, which, the, model, of, german, combat, operations, was, built, for, the, first, world, war, remained, largely, unaltered, from, the, napoleonic, model, but, took, into, the, consideration, the, vast, improvements, in, the, firepower, and, the, ability, to, conduct, great, battles, of, annihilation, through, rapid, concentration, of, force, strategic, mobility, and, the, maintenance, of, the, strategic, offensive, better, known, as, the, cult, of, the, offensive, the, key, to, this, and, other, modes, of, thinking, about, war, remained, analysis, of, military, history, and, attempts, to, derive, tangible, lessons, that, could, be, replicated, again, with, equal, success, on, another, battlefield, as, a, sort, of, bloody, laboratory, of, military, science, few, were, bloodier, than, the, fields, of, the, western, front, between, 1914, and, 1918, the, person, who, probably, understood, clausewitz, better, than, most, marshal, foch, initially, participated, in, events, that, nearly, destroyed, the, french, army, it, is, not, however, true, to, say, that, military, theorists, and, commanders, were, suffering, from, some, collective, case, of, stupidity, their, analysis, of, military, history, convinced, them, that, decisive, and, aggressive, strategic, offensive, was, the, only, doctrine, of, victory, and, feared, that, overemphasis, of, firepower, and, the, resultant, dependence, on, entrenchment, would, make, this, all, but, impossible, and, leading, to, the, battlefield, stagnant, in, advantages, of, the, defensive, position, destroying, troop, morale, and, willingness, to, fight, because, only, the, offensive, could, bring, victory, lack, of, it, and, not, the, firepower, was, blamed, for, the, defeat, of, the, imperial, russian, army, in, the, russo, japanese, war, foch, thought, that, in, strategy, as, well, as, in, tactics, one, attacks, in, many, ways, military, science, was, born, as, a, result, of, the, experiences, of, the, great, war, military, implements, had, changed, armies, beyond, recognition, with, cavalry, to, virtually, disappear, in, the, next, 20, years, the, supply, of, an, army, would, become, a, science, of, logistics, in, the, wake, of, massive, armies, operations, and, troops, that, could, fire, ammunition, faster, than, it, could, be, produced, for, the, first, time, using, vehicles, that, used, the, combustion, engine, a, watershed, of, change, military, organisation, would, no, longer, be, that, of, the, linear, warfare, but, assault, teams, and, battalions, that, were, becoming, multi, skilled, with, the, introduction, of, machine, guns, and, mortars, and, for, the, first, time, forcing, military, commanders, to, think, not, only, in, terms, of, rank, and, file, but, force, structure, tactics, changed, too, with, infantry, for, the, first, time, segregated, from, the, horse, mounted, troops, and, required, to, cooperate, with, tanks, aircraft, and, new, artillery, tactics, perception, of, military, discipline, too, had, changed, morale, despite, strict, disciplinarian, attitudes, had, cracked, in, all, armies, during, the, war, but, the, best, performing, troops, were, found, to, be, those, where, emphasis, on, discipline, had, been, replaced, with, display, of, personal, initiative, and, group, cohesiveness, such, as, that, found, in, the, australian, corps, during, the, hundred, days, offensive, the, military, sciences, analysis, of, military, history, that, had, failed, european, commanders, was, about, to, give, way, to, a, new, military, science, less, conspicuous, in, appearance, but, more, aligned, to, the, processes, of, science, of, testing, and, experimentation, the, scientific, method, and, forever, wed, to, the, idea, of, the, superiority, of, technology, on, the, battlefield, currently, military, science, still, means, many, things, to, different, organisations, in, the, united, kingdom, and, much, of, the, european, union, the, approach, is, to, relate, it, closely, to, the, civilian, application, and, understanding, for, example, in, belgium, s, royal, military, academy, military, science, remains, an, academic, discipline, and, is, studied, alongside, social, sciences, including, such, subjects, as, humanitarian, law, the, united, states, department, of, defense, defines, military, science, in, terms, of, specific, systems, and, operational, requirements, and, include, among, other, areas, civil, defense, and, force, structure, in, the, first, instance, military, science, is, concerned, with, who, will, participate, in, military, operations, and, what, sets, of, skills, and, knowledge, they, will, require, to, do, so, effectively, and, somewhat, ingeniously, develops, optimal, methods, for, the, administration, and, organization, of, military, units, as, well, as, the, military, as, a, whole, in, addition, this, area, studies, other, associated, aspects, as, mobilization, demobilization, and, military, government, for, areas, recently, conquered, or, liberated, from, enemy, control, force, structuring, is, the, method, by, which, personnel, and, the, weapons, and, equipment, they, use, are, organized, and, trained, for, military, operations, including, combat, development, of, force, structure, in, any, country, is, based, on, strategic, operational, and, tactical, needs, of, the, national, defense, policy, the, identified, threats, to, the, country, and, the, technological, capabilities, of, the, threats, and, the, armed, forces, force, structure, development, is, guided, by, doctrinal, considerations, of, strategic, operational, and, tactical, deployment, and, employment, of, formations, and, units, to, territories, areas, and, zones, where, they, are, expected, to, perform, their, missions, and, tasks, force, structuring, applies, to, all, armed, services, but, not, to, their, supporting, organisations, such, as, those, used, for, defense, science, research, activities, in, the, united, states, force, structure, is, guided, by, the, table, of, organization, and, equipment, toe, or, to, e, the, toe, is, a, document, published, by, the, u, s, department, of, defense, which, prescribes, the, organization, manning, and, equipage, of, units, from, divisional, size, and, down, but, also, including, the, headquarters, of, corps, and, armies, force, structuring, also, provides, information, on, the, mission, and, capabilities, of, specific, units, as, well, as, the, unit, s, current, status, in, terms, of, posture, and, readiness, a, general, toe, is, applicable, to, a, type, of, unit, for, instance, infantry, rather, than, a, specific, unit, the, 3rd, infantry, division, in, this, way, all, units, of, the, same, branch, such, as, infantry, follow, the, same, structural, guidelines, which, allows, for, more, efficient, financing, training, and, employment, of, like, units, operationally, studies, the, methodology, and, practices, involved, in, training, soldiers, ncos, non, commissioned, officers, i, e, sergeants, and, corporals, and, officers, it, also, extends, this, to, training, small, and, large, units, both, individually, and, in, concert, with, one, another, for, both, the, regular, and, reserve, organizations, military, training, especially, for, officers, also, concerns, itself, with, general, education, and, political, indoctrination, of, the, armed, forces, much, of, capability, development, depends, on, the, concepts, which, guide, use, of, the, armed, forces, and, their, weapons, and, equipment, and, the, methods, employed, in, any, given, theatre, of, war, or, combat, environment, military, activity, has, been, a, constant, process, over, thousands, of, years, and, the, essential, tactics, strategy, and, goals, of, military, operations, have, been, unchanging, throughout, history, as, an, example, one, notable, maneuver, is, the, double, envelopment, considered, to, be, the, consummate, military, maneuver, notably, executed, by, hannibal, at, the, battle, of, cannae, in, 216, bce, and, later, by, khalid, ibn, al, walid, at, the, battle, of, walaja, in, 633, ce, via, the, study, of, history, the, military, seeks, to, avoid, past, mistakes, and, improve, upon, its, current, performance, by, instilling, an, ability, in, commanders, to, perceive, historical, parallels, during, battle, so, as, to, capitalize, on, the, lessons, learned, the, main, areas, military, history, includes, are, the, history, of, wars, battles, and, combats, history, of, the, military, art, and, history, of, each, specific, military, service, military, strategy, is, in, many, ways, the, centerpiece, of, military, science, it, studies, the, specifics, of, planning, for, and, engaging, in, combat, and, attempts, to, reduce, the, many, factors, to, a, set, of, principles, that, govern, all, interactions, of, the, field, of, battle, in, europe, these, principles, were, first, defined, by, clausewitz, in, his, principles, of, war, as, such, it, directs, the, planning, and, execution, of, battles, operations, and, wars, as, a, whole, two, major, systems, prevail, on, the, planet, today, broadly, speaking, these, may, be, described, as, the, western, system, and, the, russian, system, each, system, reflects, and, supports, strengths, and, weakness, in, the, underlying, society, modern, western, military, art, is, composed, primarily, of, an, amalgam, of, french, german, british, and, american, systems, the, russian, system, borrows, from, these, systems, as, well, either, through, study, or, personal, observation, in, the, form, of, invasion, napoleon, s, war, of, 1812, and, the, great, patriotic, war, and, form, a, unique, product, suited, for, the, conditions, practitioners, of, this, system, will, encounter, the, system, that, is, produced, by, the, analysis, provided, by, military, art, is, known, as, doctrine, western, military, doctrine, relies, heavily, on, technology, the, use, of, a, well, trained, and, empowered, nco, cadre, and, superior, information, processing, and, dissemination, to, provide, a, level, of, battlefield, awareness, that, opponents, cannot, match, its, advantages, are, extreme, flexibility, extreme, lethality, and, a, focus, on, removing, an, opponent, s, c3i, command, communications, control, and, intelligence, to, paralyze, and, incapacitate, rather, than, destroying, their, combat, power, directly, hopefully, saving, lives, in, the, process, its, drawbacks, are, high, expense, a, reliance, on, difficult, to, replace, personnel, an, enormous, logistic, train, and, a, difficulty, in, operating, without, high, technology, assets, if, depleted, or, destroyed, soviet, military, doctrine, and, its, descendants, in, cis, countries, relies, heavily, on, masses, of, machinery, and, troops, a, highly, educated, albeit, very, small, officer, corps, and, pre, planned, missions, its, advantages, are, that, it, does, not, require, well, educated, troops, does, not, require, a, large, logistic, train, is, under, tight, central, control, and, does, not, rely, on, a, sophisticated, c3i, system, after, the, initiation, of, a, course, of, action, its, disadvantages, are, inflexibility, a, reliance, on, the, shock, effect, of, mass, with, a, resulting, high, cost, in, lives, and, material, and, overall, inability, to, exploit, unexpected, success, or, respond, to, unexpected, loss, chinese, military, doctrine, is, currently, in, a, state, of, flux, as, the, people, s, liberation, army, is, evaluating, military, trends, of, relevance, to, china, chinese, military, doctrine, is, influenced, by, a, number, of, sources, including, an, indigenous, classical, military, tradition, characterized, by, strategists, such, as, sun, tzu, western, and, soviet, influences, as, well, as, indigenous, modern, strategists, such, as, mao, zedong, one, distinctive, characteristic, of, chinese, military, science, is, that, it, places, emphasis, on, the, relationship, between, the, military, and, society, as, well, as, viewing, military, force, as, merely, one, part, of, an, overarching, grand, strategy, each, system, trains, its, officer, corps, in, its, philosophy, regarding, military, art, the, differences, in, content, and, emphasis, are, illustrative, the, united, states, army, principles, of, war, are, defined, in, the, u, s, army, field, manual, fm, 100, 5, the, canadian, forces, principles, of, war, military, science, are, defined, by, land, forces, doctrine, and, training, system, lfdts, to, focus, on, principles, of, command, principles, of, war, operational, art, and, campaign, planning, and, scientific, principles, russian, federation, armed, forces, derive, their, principles, of, war, predominantly, from, those, developed, during, the, existence, of, the, soviet, union, these, although, based, significantly, on, the, second, world, war, experience, in, conventional, war, fighting, have, been, substantially, modified, since, the, introduction, of, the, nuclear, arms, into, strategic, considerations, the, soviet, afghan, war, and, the, first, and, second, chechen, wars, further, modified, the, principles, that, soviet, theorists, had, divided, into, the, operational, art, and, tactics, the, very, scientific, approach, to, military, science, thinking, in, the, soviet, union, had, been, perceived, as, overly, rigid, at, the, tactical, level, and, had, affected, the, training, in, the, russian, federation, s, much, reduced, forces, to, instil, greater, professionalism, and, initiative, in, the, forces, the, military, principles, of, war, of, the, people, s, liberation, army, were, loosely, based, on, those, of, the, soviet, union, until, the, 1980s, when, a, significant, shift, begun, to, be, seen, in, a, more, regionally, aware, and, geographically, specific, strategic, operational, and, tactical, thinking, in, all, services, the, pla, is, currently, influenced, by, three, doctrinal, schools, which, both, conflict, and, complement, each, other, the, people, s, war, the, regional, war, and, the, revolution, in, military, affairs, that, led, to, substantial, increase, in, the, defense, spending, and, rate, of, technological, modernisation, of, the, forces, the, differences, in, the, specifics, of, military, art, notwithstanding, military, science, strives, to, provide, an, integrated, picture, of, the, chaos, of, battle, and, illuminate, basic, insights, that, apply, to, all, combatants, not, just, those, who, agree, with, your, formulation, of, the, principles, military, geography, encompasses, much, more, than, simple, protestations, to, take, the, high, ground, military, geography, studies, the, obvious, the, geography, of, theatres, of, war, but, also, the, additional, characteristics, of, politics, economics, and, other, natural, features, of, locations, of, likely, conflict, the, political, landscape, for, example, as, an, example, the, soviet, afghan, war, was, predicated, on, the, ability, of, the, soviet, union, to, not, only, successfully, invade, afghanistan, but, also, to, militarily, and, politically, flank, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, simultaneously, how, effectively, and, efficiently, militaries, accomplish, their, operations, missions, and, tasks, is, closely, related, not, only, to, the, methods, they, use, but, the, equipment, and, weapons, they, use, military, intelligence, supports, the, combat, commanders, decision, making, process, by, providing, intelligence, analysis, of, available, data, from, a, wide, range, of, sources, to, provide, that, informed, analysis, the, commanders, information, requirements, are, identified, and, input, to, a, process, of, gathering, analysis, protection, and, dissemination, of, information, about, the, operational, environment, hostile, friendly, and, neutral, forces, and, the, civilian, population, in, an, area, of, combat, operations, and, broader, area, of, interest, intelligence, activities, are, conducted, at, all, levels, from, tactical, to, strategic, in, peacetime, the, period, of, transition, to, war, and, during, the, war, most, militaries, maintain, a, military, intelligence, capability, to, provide, analytical, and, information, collection, personnel, in, both, specialist, units, and, from, other, arms, and, services, personnel, selected, for, intelligence, duties, whether, specialist, intelligence, officers, and, enlisted, soldiers, or, non, specialist, assigned, to, intelligence, may, be, selected, for, their, analytical, abilities, and, intelligence, before, receiving, formal, training, military, intelligence, serves, to, identify, the, threat, and, provide, information, on, understanding, best, methods, and, weapons, to, use, in, deterring, or, defeating, it, the, art, and, science, of, planning, and, carrying, out, the, movement, and, maintenance, of, military, forces, in, its, most, comprehensive, sense, it, is, those, aspects, or, military, operations, that, deal, with, the, design, development, acquisition, storage, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and, disposition, of, material, the, movement, evacuation, and, hospitalization, of, personnel, the, acquisition, or, construction, maintenance, operation, and, disposition, of, facilities, and, the, acquisition, or, furnishing, of, services, military, technology, is, not, just, the, study, of, various, technologies, and, applicable, physical, sciences, used, to, increase, military, power, it, may, also, extend, to, the, study, of, production, methods, of, military, equipment, and, ways, to, improve, performance, and, reduce, material, and, or, technological, requirements, for, its, production, an, example, is, the, effort, expended, by, nazi, germany, to, produce, artificial, rubbers, and, fuels, to, reduce, or, eliminate, their, dependence, on, imported, pol, petroleum, oil, and, lubricants, and, rubber, supplies, military, technology, is, unique, only, in, its, application, not, in, its, use, of, basic, scientific, and, technological, achievements, because, of, the, uniqueness, of, use, military, technological, studies, strive, to, incorporate, evolutionary, as, well, as, the, rare, revolutionary, technologies, into, their, proper, place, of, military, application, this, speciality, examines, the, ways, that, military, and, society, interact, and, shape, each, other, the, dynamic, intersection, where, military, and, society, meet, is, influenced, by, trends, in, society, and, the, security, environment, this, field, of, study, can, be, linked, to, works, by, clausewitz, war, is, the, continuation, of, politics, by, other, means, and, sun, tzu, if, not, in, the, interest, of, the, state, do, not, act, the, contemporary, multi, and, interdisciplinary, field, traces, its, origin, to, world, war, ii, and, works, by, sociologists, and, political, scientists, this, field, of, study, includes, all, aspects, of, relations, between, armed, forces, as, a, political, social, and, economic, institution, and, the, society, state, or, political, ethnic, movement, of, which, they, are, a, part, topics, often, included, within, the, purview, of, military, and, society, include, veterans, women, in, the, military, military, families, enlistment, and, retention, reserve, forces, military, and, religion, military, privatization, civil, military, relations, civil, military, cooperation, military, and, popular, culture, military, and, the, media, military, and, disaster, assistance, military, and, the, environment, and, the, blurring, of, military, and, police, functions, in, an, all, volunteer, military, the, armed, forces, relies, on, market, forces, and, careful, recruiting, to, fill, its, ranks, it, is, thus, very, important, to, understand, factors, that, motivate, enlistment, and, reenlistment, service, members, must, have, the, mental, and, physical, ability, to, meet, the, challenges, of, military, service, and, adapt, to, the, military, s, values, and, culture, studies, show, that, enlistment, motivation, generally, incorporates, both, self, interest, pay, and, non, market, values, like, adventure, patriotism, and, comradeship, the, study, of, veterans, or, members, of, the, military, who, leave, and, return, to, the, society, is, one, of, the, most, important, subfields, of, the, military, and, society, field, of, study, veterans, and, their, issues, represent, a, microcosm, of, the, field, military, recruits, represent, inputs, that, flow, from, the, community, into, the, armed, forces, veterans, are, outputs, that, leave, the, military, and, reenter, society, changed, by, their, time, as, soldiers, sailors, marines, and, airmen, both, society, and, veteran, face, multiple, layers, of, adaptation, and, adjustment, upon, their, reentry, the, definition, of, veteran, is, surprisingly, fluid, across, countries, in, the, us, veteran, s, status, is, established, after, a, service, member, has, completed, a, minimum, period, of, service, australia, requires, deployment, to, a, combat, zone, in, the, uk, everyone, who, has, performed, military, service, for, at, least, one, day, and, drawn, a, day, s, pay, is, termed, a, veteran, the, study, of, veterans, focuses, much, attention, on, their, sometimes, uneasy, transition, back, to, civilian, society, veterans, must, navigate, a, complex, cultural, transition, when, moving, between, environments, and, they, can, expect, positive, and, negative, transition, outcomes, finding, a, good, job, and, reestablishing, a, fulfilling, family, life, is, high, on, their, resettlement, agenda, military, life, is, often, violent, and, dangerous, the, trauma, of, combat, often, results, in, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, as, well, as, painful, physical, health, challenges, which, often, lead, to, homelessness, suicide, substance, and, excessive, alcohol, use, and, family, dysfunction, society, recognizes, its, responsibilities, to, veterans, by, offering, programs, and, policies, designed, to, redress, these, problems, veterans, also, exert, an, influence, on, society, often, through, the, political, process, for, example, how, do, veterans, vote, and, establish, party, affiliation, during, the, 2004, presidential, election, veterans, were, basically, bipartisan, veterans, who, fought, in, croatia, s, war, of, independence, voted, for, the, nationalist, parties, in, greater, numbers, reserve, forces, are, service, members, who, serve, the, armed, forces, on, a, part, time, basis, these, men, and, women, constitute, a, reserve, force, that, countries, rely, on, for, their, defense, disaster, support, and, some, day, to, day, operations, etc, in, the, united, states, an, active, reservist, spends, a, weekend, a, month, and, two, weeks, a, year, in, training, the, size, of, a, county, s, reserve, force, often, depends, on, the, type, of, recruitment, method, nations, with, a, volunteer, force, tend, to, have, a, lower, reserve, percentage, recently, the, role, of, the, reserves, has, changed, in, many, countries, it, has, gone, from, a, strategic, force, largely, static, to, an, operational, force, largely, dynamic, after, wwii, relatively, large, standing, forces, took, care, of, most, operational, needs, reserves, were, held, back, strategically, and, deployed, in, times, of, emergency, for, example, during, the, cuban, missile, crisis, subsequently, the, strategic, and, budget, situation, changed, and, as, a, result, the, active, duty, military, began, to, rely, on, reserve, force,
