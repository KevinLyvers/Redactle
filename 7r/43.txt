government, spending, public, expenditures, or, as, a, way, to, regulate, and, reduce, negative, externalities, tax, compliance, refers, to, policy, actions, and, individual, behaviour, aimed, at, ensuring, that, taxpayers, are, paying, the, right, amount, of, tax, at, the, right, time, and, securing, the, correct, tax, allowances, and, tax, relief, the, first, known, taxation, took, place, in, ancient, egypt, around, 3000, 2800, bc, taxes, consist, of, direct, or, indirect, taxes, and, may, be, paid, in, money, or, as, its, labor, equivalent, all, countries, have, a, tax, system, in, place, in, order, to, pay, for, public, common, societal, or, agreed, national, needs, and, for, the, functions, of, government, some, countries, levy, a, flat, percentage, rate, of, taxation, on, personal, annual, income, but, most, scale, taxes, are, progressive, based, on, brackets, of, annual, income, amounts, most, countries, charge, a, tax, on, an, individual, s, income, as, well, as, on, corporate, income, countries, or, sub, units, often, also, impose, wealth, taxes, inheritance, taxes, gift, taxes, property, taxes, sales, taxes, use, taxes, environmental, taxes, payroll, taxes, duties, or, tariffs, it, is, also, possible, to, levy, a, tax, on, tax, as, with, a, gross, receipts, tax, in, economic, terms, circular, flow, of, income, taxation, transfers, wealth, from, households, or, businesses, to, the, government, this, has, effects, on, economic, growth, and, economic, welfare, that, can, be, both, increased, known, as, fiscal, multiplier, or, decreased, known, as, excess, burden, of, taxation, consequently, taxation, is, a, highly, debated, topic, by, some, as, although, taxation, is, deemed, necessary, by, general, consensus, in, order, for, society, to, function, and, grow, in, an, orderly, and, equitable, manner, through, the, government, provision, of, public, goods, and, public, services, others, such, as, libertarians, and, anarcho, capitalists, are, anti, taxation, and, denounce, taxation, broadly, or, in, its, entirety, classifying, taxation, as, theft, or, extortion, through, coercion, along, with, the, use, of, force, within, market, economies, taxation, is, considered, as, the, most, viable, option, to, operate, the, government, instead, of, widespread, state, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, as, taxation, enables, the, government, to, generate, revenue, without, heavily, interfering, with, the, market, and, private, businesses, taxation, preserves, the, efficiency, and, productivity, of, the, private, sector, by, allowing, individuals, and, businesses, to, make, their, own, economic, decisions, engage, in, flexible, production, competition, and, innovation, as, a, result, of, market, forces, certain, countries, usually, small, in, size, or, population, which, results, in, a, smaller, infrastructure, and, social, expenditure, function, as, tax, havens, by, imposing, minimal, taxes, on, the, personal, income, of, individuals, and, on, corporate, income, these, tax, havens, attract, capital, from, abroad, particularly, from, larger, economies, whilst, resulting, in, loss, of, tax, revenues, within, other, non, haven, countries, through, base, erosion, and, profit, shifting, legal, and, economic, definitions, of, taxes, differ, such, that, many, transfers, to, governments, are, not, considered, taxes, by, economists, for, example, some, transfers, to, the, public, sector, are, comparable, to, prices, examples, include, tuition, at, public, universities, and, fees, for, utilities, provided, by, local, governments, governments, also, obtain, resources, by, creating, money, and, coins, for, example, by, printing, bills, and, by, minting, coins, through, voluntary, gifts, for, example, contributions, to, public, universities, and, museums, by, imposing, penalties, such, as, traffic, fines, by, borrowing, and, confiscating, criminal, proceeds, from, the, view, of, economists, a, tax, is, a, non, penal, yet, compulsory, transfer, of, resources, from, the, private, to, the, public, sector, levied, on, a, basis, of, predetermined, criteria, and, without, reference, to, specific, benefits, received, in, modern, taxation, systems, governments, levy, taxes, in, money, but, in, kind, and, corv, e, taxation, are, characteristic, of, traditional, or, pre, capitalist, states, and, their, functional, equivalents, the, method, of, taxation, and, the, government, expenditure, of, taxes, raised, is, often, highly, debated, in, politics, and, economics, tax, collection, is, performed, by, a, government, agency, such, as, the, internal, revenue, service, irs, in, the, united, states, his, majesty, s, revenue, and, customs, hmrc, in, the, united, kingdom, the, canada, revenue, agency, or, the, australian, taxation, office, when, taxes, are, not, fully, paid, the, state, may, impose, civil, penalties, such, as, fines, or, forfeiture, or, criminal, penalties, such, as, incarceration, on, the, non, paying, entity, or, individual, the, levying, of, taxes, aims, to, raise, revenue, to, fund, governing, to, alter, prices, in, order, to, affect, demand, or, to, regulate, some, form, of, cost, or, benefit, states, and, their, functional, equivalents, throughout, history, have, used, the, money, provided, by, taxation, to, carry, out, many, functions, some, of, these, include, expenditures, on, economic, infrastructure, roads, public, transportation, sanitation, legal, systems, public, security, public, education, public, health, systems, military, scientific, research, development, culture, and, the, arts, public, works, distribution, data, collection, and, dissemination, public, insurance, and, the, operation, of, government, itself, a, government, s, ability, to, raise, taxes, is, called, its, fiscal, capacity, when, expenditures, exceed, tax, revenue, a, government, accumulates, government, debt, a, portion, of, taxes, may, be, used, to, service, past, debts, governments, also, use, taxes, to, fund, welfare, and, public, services, these, services, can, include, education, systems, pensions, for, the, elderly, unemployment, benefits, transfer, payments, subsidies, and, public, transportation, energy, water, and, waste, management, systems, are, also, common, public, utilities, according, to, the, proponents, of, the, chartalist, theory, of, money, creation, taxes, are, not, needed, for, government, revenue, as, long, as, the, government, in, question, is, able, to, issue, fiat, money, according, to, this, view, the, purpose, of, taxation, is, to, maintain, the, stability, of, the, currency, express, public, policy, regarding, the, distribution, of, wealth, subsidizing, certain, industries, or, population, groups, or, isolating, the, costs, of, certain, benefits, such, as, highways, or, social, security, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, publishes, an, analysis, of, the, tax, systems, of, member, countries, as, part, of, such, analysis, oecd, has, developed, a, definition, and, system, of, classification, of, internal, taxes, generally, followed, below, in, addition, many, countries, impose, taxes, tariffs, on, the, import, of, goods, many, jurisdictions, tax, the, income, of, individuals, and, of, business, entities, including, corporations, generally, the, authorities, impose, a, tax, on, net, profits, from, a, business, on, net, gains, and, on, other, income, computation, of, income, subject, to, tax, may, be, determined, under, accounting, principles, used, in, the, jurisdiction, which, tax, law, principles, in, the, jurisdiction, may, modify, or, replace, the, incidence, of, taxation, varies, by, system, and, some, systems, may, be, viewed, as, progressive, or, regressive, rates, of, tax, may, vary, or, be, constant, flat, by, income, level, many, systems, allow, individuals, certain, personal, allowances, and, other, non, business, reductions, to, taxable, income, although, business, deductions, tend, to, be, favored, over, personal, deductions, tax, collection, agencies, often, collect, personal, income, tax, on, a, pay, as, you, earn, basis, with, corrections, made, after, the, end, of, the, tax, year, these, corrections, take, one, of, two, forms, income, tax, systems, often, make, deductions, available, that, reduce, the, total, tax, liability, by, reducing, total, taxable, income, they, may, allow, losses, from, one, type, of, income, to, count, against, another, for, example, a, loss, on, the, stock, market, may, be, deducted, against, taxes, paid, on, wages, other, tax, systems, may, isolate, the, loss, such, that, business, losses, can, only, be, deducted, against, business, income, tax, by, carrying, forward, the, loss, to, later, tax, years, in, economics, a, negative, income, tax, abbreviated, nit, is, a, progressive, income, tax, system, where, people, earning, below, a, certain, amount, receive, supplemental, payment, from, the, government, instead, of, paying, taxes, to, the, government, most, jurisdictions, imposing, an, income, tax, treat, capital, gains, as, part, of, income, subject, to, tax, capital, gain, is, generally, a, gain, on, sale, of, capital, assets, that, is, those, assets, not, held, for, sale, in, the, ordinary, course, of, business, capital, assets, include, personal, assets, in, many, jurisdictions, some, jurisdictions, provide, preferential, rates, of, tax, or, only, partial, taxation, for, capital, gains, some, jurisdictions, impose, different, rates, or, levels, of, capital, gains, taxation, based, on, the, length, of, time, the, asset, was, held, because, tax, rates, are, often, much, lower, for, capital, gains, than, for, ordinary, income, there, is, widespread, controversy, and, dispute, about, the, proper, definition, of, capital, corporate, tax, refers, to, income, tax, capital, tax, net, worth, tax, or, other, taxes, imposed, on, corporations, rates, of, tax, and, the, taxable, base, for, corporations, may, differ, from, those, for, individuals, or, for, other, taxable, persons, many, countries, provide, publicly, funded, retirement, or, healthcare, systems, in, connection, with, these, systems, the, country, typically, requires, employers, or, employees, to, make, compulsory, payments, these, payments, are, often, computed, by, reference, to, wages, or, earnings, from, self, employment, tax, rates, are, generally, fixed, but, a, different, rate, may, be, imposed, on, employers, than, on, employees, some, systems, provide, an, upper, limit, on, earnings, subject, to, the, tax, a, few, systems, provide, that, the, tax, is, payable, only, on, wages, above, a, particular, amount, such, upper, or, lower, limits, may, apply, for, retirement, but, not, for, health, care, components, of, the, tax, some, have, argued, that, such, taxes, on, wages, are, a, form, of, forced, savings, and, not, really, a, tax, while, others, point, to, redistribution, through, such, systems, between, generations, from, newer, cohorts, to, older, cohorts, and, across, income, levels, from, higher, income, levels, to, lower, income, levels, which, suggests, that, such, programs, are, really, taxed, and, spending, programs, unemployment, and, similar, taxes, are, often, imposed, on, employers, based, on, the, total, payroll, these, taxes, may, be, imposed, in, both, the, country, and, sub, country, levels, a, wealth, tax, is, levied, on, the, total, value, of, personal, assets, including, bank, deposits, real, estate, assets, in, insurance, and, pension, plans, ownership, of, unincorporated, businesses, financial, securities, and, personal, trusts, liabilities, primarily, mortgages, and, other, loans, are, typically, deducted, hence, it, is, sometimes, called, a, net, wealth, tax, recurrent, property, taxes, may, be, imposed, on, immovable, property, real, property, and, on, some, classes, of, movable, property, in, addition, recurrent, taxes, may, be, imposed, on, the, net, wealth, of, individuals, or, corporations, many, jurisdictions, impose, inheritance, tax, on, property, at, time, of, inheritance, or, gift, tax, at, the, time, of, gift, transfer, some, jurisdictions, impose, taxes, on, financial, or, capital, transactions, a, property, tax, or, millage, tax, is, an, ad, valorem, tax, levy, on, the, value, of, a, property, that, the, owner, of, the, property, is, required, to, pay, to, a, government, in, which, the, property, is, situated, multiple, jurisdictions, may, tax, the, same, property, there, are, three, general, varieties, of, property, land, improvements, to, land, immovable, human, made, things, e, g, buildings, and, personal, property, movable, things, real, estate, or, realty, is, the, combination, of, land, and, improvements, to, the, land, property, taxes, are, usually, charged, on, a, recurrent, basis, e, g, yearly, a, common, type, of, property, tax, is, an, annual, charge, on, the, ownership, of, real, estate, where, the, tax, base, is, the, estimated, value, of, the, property, for, a, period, of, over, 150, years, from, 1695, the, government, of, england, levied, a, window, tax, with, the, result, that, one, can, still, see, listed, buildings, with, windows, bricked, up, in, order, to, save, their, owner, s, money, a, similar, tax, on, hearths, existed, in, france, and, elsewhere, with, similar, results, the, two, most, common, types, of, event, driven, property, taxes, are, stamp, duty, charged, upon, change, of, ownership, and, inheritance, tax, which, many, countries, impose, on, the, estates, of, the, deceased, in, contrast, with, a, tax, on, real, estate, land, and, buildings, a, land, value, tax, or, lvt, is, levied, only, on, the, unimproved, value, of, the, land, land, in, this, instance, may, mean, either, the, economic, term, i, e, all, natural, resources, or, the, natural, resources, associated, with, specific, areas, of, the, earth, s, surface, lots, or, land, parcels, proponents, of, the, land, value, tax, argue, that, it, is, economically, justified, as, it, will, not, deter, production, distort, market, mechanisms, or, otherwise, create, deadweight, losses, the, way, other, taxes, do, when, real, estate, is, held, by, a, higher, government, unit, or, some, other, entity, not, subject, to, taxation, by, the, local, government, the, taxing, authority, may, receive, a, payment, in, lieu, of, taxes, to, compensate, it, for, some, or, all, of, the, foregone, tax, revenues, in, many, jurisdictions, including, many, american, states, there, is, a, general, tax, levied, periodically, on, residents, who, own, personal, property, personalty, within, the, jurisdiction, vehicle, and, boat, registration, fees, are, subsets, of, this, kind, of, tax, the, tax, is, often, designed, with, blanket, coverage, and, large, exceptions, for, things, like, food, and, clothing, household, goods, are, often, exempt, when, kept, or, used, within, the, household, any, otherwise, non, exempt, object, can, lose, its, exemption, if, regularly, kept, outside, the, household, thus, tax, collectors, often, monitor, newspaper, articles, for, stories, about, wealthy, people, who, have, lent, art, to, museums, for, public, display, because, the, artworks, have, then, become, subject, to, personal, property, tax, if, an, artwork, had, to, be, sent, to, another, state, for, some, touch, ups, it, may, have, become, subject, to, personal, property, tax, in, that, state, as, well, inheritance, tax, also, called, estate, tax, are, taxes, that, arise, for, inheritance, or, inherited, income, in, united, states, tax, law, there, is, a, distinction, between, an, estate, tax, and, an, inheritance, tax, the, former, taxes, the, personal, representatives, of, the, deceased, while, the, latter, taxes, the, beneficiaries, of, the, estate, however, this, distinction, does, not, apply, in, other, jurisdictions, for, example, if, using, this, terminology, uk, inheritance, tax, would, be, an, estate, tax, an, expatriation, tax, is, a, tax, on, individuals, who, renounce, their, citizenship, or, residence, the, tax, is, often, imposed, based, on, a, deemed, disposition, of, all, the, individual, s, property, one, example, is, the, united, states, under, the, american, jobs, creation, act, where, any, individual, who, has, a, net, worth, of, 2, million, or, an, average, income, tax, liability, of, 127, 000, who, renounces, his, or, her, citizenship, and, leaves, the, country, is, automatically, assumed, to, have, done, so, for, tax, avoidance, reasons, and, is, subject, to, a, higher, tax, rate, historically, in, many, countries, a, contract, needs, to, have, a, stamp, affixed, to, make, it, valid, the, charge, for, the, stamp, is, either, a, fixed, amount, or, a, percentage, of, the, value, of, the, transaction, in, most, countries, the, stamp, has, been, abolished, but, stamp, duty, remains, stamp, duty, is, levied, in, the, uk, on, the, purchase, of, shares, and, securities, the, issue, of, bearer, instruments, and, certain, partnership, transactions, its, modern, derivatives, stamp, duty, reserve, tax, and, stamp, duty, land, tax, are, respectively, charged, on, transactions, involving, securities, and, land, stamp, duty, has, the, effect, of, discouraging, speculative, purchases, of, assets, by, decreasing, liquidity, in, the, united, states, transfer, tax, is, often, charged, by, the, state, or, local, government, and, in, the, case, of, real, property, transfers, can, be, tied, to, the, recording, of, the, deed, or, other, transfer, documents, some, countries, governments, will, require, a, declaration, of, the, taxpayers, balance, sheet, assets, and, liabilities, and, from, that, exact, a, tax, on, net, worth, assets, minus, liabilities, as, a, percentage, of, the, net, worth, or, a, percentage, of, the, net, worth, exceeding, a, certain, level, the, tax, may, be, levied, on, natural, or, legal, persons, a, value, added, tax, vat, also, known, as, goods, and, services, tax, gst, single, business, tax, or, turnover, tax, in, some, countries, applies, the, equivalent, of, a, sales, tax, to, every, operation, that, creates, value, to, give, an, example, sheet, steel, is, imported, by, a, machine, manufacturer, that, manufacturer, will, pay, the, vat, on, the, purchase, price, remitting, that, amount, to, the, government, the, manufacturer, will, then, transform, the, steel, into, a, machine, selling, the, machine, for, a, higher, price, to, a, wholesale, distributor, the, manufacturer, will, collect, the, vat, on, the, higher, price, but, will, remit, to, the, government, only, the, excess, related, to, the, value, added, the, price, over, the, cost, of, the, sheet, steel, the, wholesale, distributor, will, then, continue, the, process, charging, the, retail, distributor, the, vat, on, the, entire, price, to, the, retailer, but, remitting, only, the, amount, related, to, the, distribution, mark, up, to, the, government, the, last, vat, amount, is, paid, by, the, eventual, retail, customer, who, cannot, recover, any, of, the, previously, paid, vat, for, a, vat, and, sales, tax, of, identical, rates, the, total, tax, paid, is, the, same, but, it, is, paid, at, differing, points, in, the, process, vat, is, usually, administrated, by, requiring, the, company, to, complete, a, vat, return, giving, details, of, vat, it, has, been, charged, referred, to, as, input, tax, and, vat, it, has, charged, to, others, referred, to, as, output, tax, the, difference, between, output, tax, and, input, tax, is, payable, to, the, local, tax, authority, many, tax, authorities, have, introduced, automated, vat, which, has, increased, accountability, and, auditability, by, utilizing, computer, systems, thereby, also, enabling, anti, cybercrime, offices, as, well, sales, taxes, are, levied, when, a, commodity, is, sold, to, its, final, consumer, retail, organizations, contend, that, such, taxes, discourage, retail, sales, the, question, of, whether, they, are, generally, progressive, or, regressive, is, a, subject, of, much, current, debate, people, with, higher, incomes, spend, a, lower, proportion, of, them, so, a, flat, rate, sales, tax, will, tend, to, be, regressive, it, is, therefore, common, to, exempt, food, utilities, and, other, necessities, from, sales, taxes, since, poor, people, spend, a, higher, proportion, of, their, incomes, on, these, commodities, so, such, exemptions, make, the, tax, more, progressive, this, is, the, classic, you, pay, for, what, you, spend, tax, as, only, those, who, spend, money, on, non, exempt, i, e, luxury, items, pay, the, tax, a, small, number, of, u, s, states, rely, entirely, on, sales, taxes, for, state, revenue, as, those, states, do, not, levy, a, state, income, tax, such, states, tend, to, have, a, moderate, to, a, large, amount, of, tourism, or, inter, state, travel, that, occurs, within, their, borders, allowing, the, state, to, benefit, from, taxes, from, people, the, state, would, otherwise, not, tax, in, this, way, the, state, is, able, to, reduce, the, tax, burden, on, its, citizens, the, u, s, states, that, do, not, levy, a, state, income, tax, are, alaska, tennessee, florida, nevada, south, dakota, texas, washington, state, and, wyoming, additionally, new, hampshire, and, tennessee, levy, state, income, taxes, only, on, dividends, and, interest, income, of, the, above, states, only, alaska, and, new, hampshire, do, not, levy, a, state, sales, tax, additional, information, can, be, obtained, at, the, federation, of, tax, administrators, website, in, the, united, states, there, is, a, growing, movement, for, the, replacement, of, all, federal, payroll, and, income, taxes, both, corporate, and, personal, with, a, national, retail, sales, tax, and, monthly, tax, rebate, to, households, of, citizens, and, legal, resident, aliens, the, tax, proposal, is, named, fairtax, in, canada, the, federal, sales, tax, is, called, the, goods, and, services, tax, gst, and, now, stands, at, 5, the, provinces, of, british, columbia, saskatchewan, manitoba, and, prince, edward, island, also, have, a, provincial, sales, tax, the, provinces, of, nova, scotia, new, brunswick, newfoundland, labrador, and, ontario, have, harmonized, their, provincial, sales, taxes, with, the, gst, harmonized, sales, tax, and, thus, is, a, full, vat, the, province, of, quebec, collects, the, quebec, sales, tax, which, is, based, on, the, gst, with, certain, differences, most, businesses, can, claim, back, the, gst, hst, and, qst, they, pay, and, so, effectively, it, is, the, final, consumer, who, pays, the, tax, an, excise, duty, is, an, indirect, tax, imposed, upon, goods, during, the, process, of, their, manufacture, production, or, distribution, and, is, usually, proportionate, to, their, quantity, or, value, excise, duties, were, first, introduced, into, england, in, the, year, 1643, as, part, of, a, scheme, of, revenue, and, taxation, devised, by, parliamentarian, john, pym, and, approved, by, the, long, parliament, these, duties, consisted, of, charges, on, beer, ale, cider, cherry, wine, and, tobacco, to, which, list, were, afterward, added, paper, soap, candles, malt, hops, and, sweets, the, basic, principle, of, excise, duties, was, that, they, were, taxes, on, the, production, manufacture, or, distribution, of, articles, which, could, not, be, taxed, through, the, customs, house, and, revenue, derived, from, that, source, is, called, excise, revenue, proper, the, fundamental, conception, of, the, term, is, that, of, a, tax, on, articles, produced, or, manufactured, in, a, country, in, the, taxation, of, such, articles, of, luxury, as, spirits, beer, tobacco, and, cigars, it, has, been, the, practice, to, place, a, certain, duty, on, the, importation, of, these, articles, a, customs, duty, excises, or, exemptions, from, them, are, also, used, to, modify, consumption, patterns, of, a, certain, area, social, engineering, for, example, a, high, excise, is, used, to, discourage, alcohol, consumption, relative, to, other, goods, this, may, be, combined, with, hypothecation, if, the, proceeds, are, then, used, to, pay, for, the, costs, of, treating, illness, caused, by, alcohol, use, disorder, similar, taxes, may, exist, on, tobacco, pornography, marijuana, etc, and, they, may, be, collectively, referred, to, as, sin, taxes, a, carbon, tax, is, a, tax, on, the, consumption, of, carbon, based, non, renewable, fuels, such, as, petrol, diesel, fuel, jet, fuels, and, natural, gas, the, object, is, to, reduce, the, release, of, carbon, into, the, atmosphere, in, the, united, kingdom, vehicle, excise, duty, is, an, annual, tax, on, vehicle, ownership, an, import, or, export, tariff, also, called, customs, duty, or, impost, is, a, charge, for, the, movement, of, goods, through, a, political, border, tariffs, discourage, trade, and, they, may, be, used, by, governments, to, protect, domestic, industries, a, proportion, of, tariff, revenues, is, often, hypothecated, to, pay, the, government, to, maintain, a, navy, or, border, police, the, classic, ways, of, cheating, a, tariff, are, smuggling, or, declaring, a, false, value, of, goods, tax, tariff, and, trade, rules, in, modern, times, are, usually, set, together, because, of, their, common, impact, on, industrial, policy, investment, policy, and, agricultural, policy, a, trade, bloc, is, a, group, of, allied, countries, agreeing, to, minimize, or, eliminate, tariffs, against, trade, with, each, other, and, possibly, to, impose, protective, tariffs, on, imports, from, outside, the, bloc, a, customs, union, has, a, common, external, tariff, and, the, participating, countries, share, the, revenues, from, tariffs, on, goods, entering, the, customs, union, in, some, societies, tariffs, also, could, be, imposed, by, local, authorities, on, the, movement, of, goods, between, regions, or, via, specific, internal, gateways, a, notable, example, is, the, likin, which, became, an, important, revenue, source, for, local, governments, in, the, late, qing, china, occupational, taxes, or, license, fees, may, be, imposed, on, businesses, or, individuals, engaged, in, certain, businesses, many, jurisdictions, impose, a, tax, on, vehicles, a, poll, tax, also, called, a, per, capita, tax, or, capitation, tax, is, a, tax, that, levies, a, set, amount, per, individual, it, is, an, example, of, the, concept, of, fixed, tax, one, of, the, earliest, taxes, mentioned, in, the, bible, of, a, half, shekel, per, annum, from, each, adult, jew, ex, 30, 11, 16, was, a, form, of, the, poll, tax, poll, taxes, are, administratively, cheap, because, they, are, easy, to, compute, and, collect, and, difficult, to, cheat, economists, have, considered, poll, taxes, economically, efficient, because, people, are, presumed, to, be, in, fixed, supply, and, poll, taxes, therefore, do, not, lead, to, economic, distortions, however, poll, taxes, are, very, unpopular, because, poorer, people, pay, a, higher, proportion, of, their, income, than, richer, people, in, addition, the, supply, of, people, is, in, fact, not, fixed, over, time, on, average, couples, will, choose, to, have, fewer, children, if, a, poll, tax, is, imposed, the, introduction, of, a, poll, tax, in, medieval, england, was, the, primary, cause, of, the, 1381, peasants, revolt, scotland, was, the, first, to, be, used, to, test, the, new, poll, tax, in, 1989, with, england, and, wales, in, 1990, the, change, from, progressive, local, taxation, based, on, property, values, to, a, single, rate, form, of, taxation, regardless, of, ability, to, pay, the, community, charge, but, more, popularly, referred, to, as, the, poll, tax, led, to, widespread, refusal, to, pay, and, to, incidents, of, civil, unrest, known, colloquially, as, the, poll, tax, riots, some, types, of, taxes, have, been, proposed, but, not, actually, adopted, in, any, major, jurisdiction, these, include, an, ad, valorem, tax, is, one, where, the, tax, base, is, the, value, of, a, good, service, or, property, sales, taxes, tariffs, property, taxes, inheritance, taxes, and, value, added, taxes, are, different, types, of, ad, valorem, tax, an, ad, valorem, tax, is, typically, imposed, at, the, time, of, a, transaction, sales, tax, or, value, added, tax, vat, but, it, may, be, imposed, on, an, annual, basis, property, tax, or, in, connection, with, another, significant, event, inheritance, tax, or, tariffs, in, contrast, to, ad, valorem, taxation, is, a, per, unit, tax, where, the, tax, base, is, the, quantity, of, something, regardless, of, its, price, an, excise, tax, is, an, example, consumption, tax, refers, to, any, tax, on, non, investment, spending, and, can, be, implemented, by, means, of, a, sales, tax, consumer, value, added, tax, or, by, modifying, an, income, tax, to, allow, for, unlimited, deductions, for, investment, or, savings, this, includes, natural, resources, consumption, tax, greenhouse, gas, tax, i, e, carbon, tax, sulfuric, tax, and, others, the, stated, purpose, is, to, reduce, the, environmental, impact, by, repricing, economists, describe, environmental, impacts, as, negative, externalities, as, early, as, 1920, arthur, pigou, suggested, a, tax, to, deal, with, externalities, see, also, the, section, on, increased, economic, welfare, below, the, proper, implementation, of, environmental, taxes, has, been, the, subject, of, a, long, lasting, debate, an, important, feature, of, tax, systems, is, the, percentage, of, the, tax, burden, as, it, relates, to, income, or, consumption, the, terms, progressive, regressive, and, proportional, are, used, to, describe, the, way, the, rate, progresses, from, low, to, high, from, high, to, low, or, proportionally, the, terms, describe, a, distribution, effect, which, can, be, applied, to, any, type, of, tax, system, income, or, consumption, that, meets, the, definition, the, terms, can, also, be, used, to, apply, meaning, to, the, taxation, of, select, consumption, such, as, a, tax, on, luxury, goods, and, the, exemption, of, basic, necessities, may, be, described, as, having, progressive, effects, as, it, increases, a, tax, burden, on, high, end, consumption, and, decreases, a, tax, burden, on, low, end, consumption, taxes, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, direct, taxes, or, indirect, taxes, the, meaning, of, these, terms, can, vary, in, different, contexts, which, can, sometimes, lead, to, confusion, an, economic, definition, by, atkinson, states, that, direct, taxes, may, be, adjusted, to, the, individual, characteristics, of, the, taxpayer, whereas, indirect, taxes, are, levied, on, transactions, irrespective, of, the, circumstances, of, buyer, or, seller, according, to, this, definition, for, example, income, tax, is, direct, and, sales, tax, is, indirect, in, law, the, terms, may, have, different, meanings, in, u, s, constitutional, law, for, instance, direct, taxes, refer, to, poll, taxes, and, property, taxes, which, are, based, on, simple, existence, or, ownership, indirect, taxes, are, imposed, on, events, rights, privileges, and, activities, thus, a, tax, on, the, sale, of, the, property, would, be, considered, an, indirect, tax, whereas, the, tax, on, simply, owning, the, property, itself, would, be, a, direct, tax, governments, may, charge, user, fees, tolls, or, other, types, of, assessments, in, exchange, of, particular, goods, services, or, use, of, property, these, are, generally, not, considered, taxes, as, long, as, they, are, levied, as, payment, for, a, direct, benefit, to, the, individual, paying, such, fees, include, some, scholars, refer, to, certain, economic, effects, as, taxes, though, they, are, not, levies, imposed, by, governments, these, include, the, first, known, system, of, taxation, was, in, ancient, egypt, around, 3000, 2800, bc, in, the, first, dynasty, of, the, old, kingdom, of, egypt, the, earliest, and, most, widespread, forms, of, taxation, were, the, corv, e, and, the, tithe, the, corv, e, was, forced, labor, provided, to, the, state, by, peasants, too, poor, to, pay, other, forms, of, taxation, labor, in, ancient, egyptian, is, a, synonym, for, taxes, records, from, the, time, document, that, the, pharaoh, would, conduct, a, biennial, tour, of, the, kingdom, collecting, tithes, from, the, people, other, records, are, granary, receipts, on, limestone, flakes, and, papyrus, early, taxation, is, also, described, in, the, bible, in, genesis, chapter, 47, verse, 24, the, new, international, version, it, states, but, when, the, crop, comes, in, give, a, fifth, of, it, to, pharaoh, the, other, four, fifths, you, may, keep, as, seed, for, the, fields, and, as, food, for, yourselves, and, your, households, and, your, children, samgharitr, is, the, name, mentioned, for, the, tax, collector, in, the, vedic, texts, in, hattusa, the, capital, of, the, hittite, empire, grains, were, collected, as, a, tax, from, the, surrounding, lands, and, stored, in, silos, as, a, display, of, the, king, s, wealth, in, the, persian, empire, a, regulated, and, sustainable, tax, system, was, introduced, by, darius, i, the, great, in, 500, bc, the, persian, system, of, taxation, was, tailored, to, each, satrapy, the, area, ruled, by, a, satrap, or, provincial, governor, at, differing, times, there, were, between, 20, and, 30, satrapies, in, the, empire, and, each, was, assessed, according, to, its, supposed, productivity, it, was, the, responsibility, of, the, satrap, to, collect, the, due, amount, and, to, send, it, to, the, treasury, after, deducting, his, expenses, the, expenses, and, the, power, of, deciding, precisely, how, and, from, whom, to, raise, the, money, in, the, province, offer, maximum, opportunity, for, rich, pickings, the, quantities, demanded, from, the, various, provinces, gave, a, vivid, picture, of, their, economic, potential, for, instance, babylon, was, assessed, for, the, highest, amount, and, for, a, startling, mixture, of, commodities, 1, 000, silver, talents, and, four, months, supply, of, food, for, the, army, india, a, province, fabled, for, its, gold, was, to, supply, gold, dust, equal, in, value, to, the, very, large, amount, of, 4, 680, silver, talents, egypt, was, known, for, the, wealth, of, its, crops, it, was, to, be, the, granary, of, the, persian, empire, and, later, of, the, roman, empire, and, was, required, to, provide, 120, 000, measures, of, grain, in, addition, to, 700, talents, of, silver, this, tax, was, exclusively, levied, on, satrapies, based, on, their, lands, productive, capacity, and, tribute, levels, the, rosetta, stone, a, tax, concession, issued, by, ptolemy, v, in, 196, bc, and, written, in, three, languages, led, to, the, most, famous, decipherment, in, history, the, cracking, of, hieroglyphics, in, the, roman, republic, taxes, were, collected, from, individuals, at, the, rate, of, between, 1, and, 3, of, the, assessed, value, of, their, total, property, however, since, it, was, extremely, difficult, to, facilitate, the, collection, of, the, tax, the, government, auctioned, it, every, year, the, winning, tax, farmers, called, publicani, paid, the, tax, revenue, to, the, government, in, advance, and, then, kept, the, taxes, collected, from, individuals, the, publicani, paid, the, tax, revenue, in, coins, but, collected, the, taxes, using, other, exchange, media, thus, relieving, the, government, of, the, work, to, carry, out, the, currency, conversion, themselves, the, revenue, payment, essentially, worked, as, a, loan, to, the, government, which, paid, interest, on, it, although, this, scheme, was, a, profitable, enterprise, for, the, government, as, well, as, the, publicani, it, was, later, replaced, by, a, direct, tax, system, by, the, emperor, augustus, after, which, each, province, was, obliged, to, pay, 1, tax, on, wealth, and, a, flat, rate, on, each, adult, this, brought, about, regular, census, and, shifted, the, tax, system, more, towards, taxing, an, individual, s, income, rather, than, wealth, islamic, rulers, imposed, zakat, a, tax, on, muslims, and, jizya, a, poll, tax, on, conquered, non, muslims, in, india, this, practice, began, in, the, 11th, century, numerous, records, of, government, tax, collection, in, europe, since, at, least, the, 17th, century, are, still, available, today, but, taxation, levels, are, hard, to, compare, to, the, size, and, flow, of, the, economy, since, production, numbers, are, not, as, readily, available, government, expenditures, and, revenue, in, france, during, the, 17th, century, went, from, about, 24, 30, million, livres, in, 1600, 10, to, about, 126, 86, million, livres, in, 1650, 59, to, about, 117, 99, million, livres, in, 1700, 10, when, government, debt, had, reached, 1, 6, billion, livres, in, 1780, 89, it, reached, 421, 50, million, livres, taxation, as, a, percentage, of, production, of, final, goods, may, have, reached, 15, 20, during, the, 17th, century, in, places, such, as, france, the, netherlands, and, scandinavia, during, the, war, filled, years, of, the, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, century, tax, rates, in, europe, increased, dramatically, as, war, became, more, expensive, and, governments, became, more, centralized, and, adept, at, gathering, taxes, this, increase, was, greatest, in, england, peter, mathias, and, patrick, o, brien, found, that, the, tax, burden, increased, by, 85, over, this, period, another, study, confirmed, this, number, finding, that, per, capita, tax, revenues, had, grown, almost, sixfold, over, the, eighteenth, century, but, that, steady, economic, growth, had, made, the, real, burden, on, each, individual, only, double, over, this, period, before, the, industrial, revolution, effective, tax, rates, were, higher, in, britain, than, france, in, the, years, before, the, french, revolution, twice, in, per, capita, income, comparison, but, they, were, mostly, placed, on, international, trade, in, france, taxes, were, lower, but, the, burden, was, mainly, on, landowners, individuals, and, internal, trade, and, thus, created, far, more, resentment, taxation, as, a, percentage, of, gdp, 2016, was, 45, 9, in, denmark, 45, 3, in, france, 33, 2, in, the, united, kingdom, 26, in, the, united, states, and, among, all, oecd, members, an, average, of, 34, 3, in, monetary, economies, prior, to, fiat, banking, a, critical, form, of, taxation, was, seigniorage, the, tax, on, the, creation, of, money, other, obsolete, forms, of, taxation, include, some, principalities, taxed, windows, doors, or, cabinets, to, reduce, consumption, of, imported, glass, and, hardware, armoires, hutches, and, wardrobes, were, employed, to, evade, taxes, on, doors, and, cabinets, in, some, circumstances, taxes, are, also, used, to, enforce, public, policy, like, congestion, charge, to, cut, road, traffic, and, encourage, public, transport, in, london, in, tsarist, russia, taxes, were, clamped, on, beards, today, one, of, the, most, complicated, taxation, systems, worldwide, is, in, germany, three, quarters, of, the, world, s, taxation, literature, refers, to, the, german, system, under, the, german, system, there, are, 118, laws, 185, forms, and, 96, 000, regulations, spending, 3, 7, billion, to, collect, the, income, tax, in, the, united, states, the, irs, has, about, 1, 177, forms, and, instructions, 28, 4111, megabytes, of, internal, revenue, code, which, contained, 3, 8, million, words, as, of, 1, february, 2010, numerous, tax, regulations, in, the, code, of, federal, regulations, and, supplementary, material, in, the, internal, revenue, bulletin, today, governments, in, more, advanced, economies, i, e, europe, and, north, america, tend, to, rely, more, on, direct, taxes, while, developing, economies, i, e, several, african, countries, rely, more, on, indirect, taxes, in, economic, terms, taxation, transfers, wealth, from, households, or, businesses, to, the, government, of, a, nation, adam, smith, writes, in, the, wealth, of, nations, that, the, side, effects, of, taxation, such, as, economic, distortions, and, theories, about, how, best, to, tax, are, an, important, subject, in, microeconomics, taxation, is, almost, never, a, simple, transfer, of, wealth, economic, theories, of, taxation, approach, the, question, of, how, to, maximize, economic, welfare, through, taxation, a, 2019, study, looking, at, the, impact, of, tax, cuts, for, different, income, groups, it, was, tax, cuts, for, low, income, groups, that, had, the, greatest, positive, impact, on, employment, growth, tax, cuts, for, the, wealthiest, top, 10, had, a, small, impact, law, establishes, from, whom, a, tax, is, collected, in, many, countries, taxes, are, imposed, on, businesses, such, as, corporate, taxes, or, portions, of, payroll, taxes, however, who, ultimately, pays, the, tax, the, tax, burden, is, determined, by, the, marketplace, as, taxes, become, embedded, into, production, costs, economic, theory, suggests, that, the, economic, effect, of, tax, does, not, necessarily, fall, at, the, point, where, it, is, legally, levied, for, instance, a, tax, on, employment, paid, by, employers, will, impact, the, employee, at, least, in, the, long, run, the, greatest, share, of, the, tax, burden, tends, to, fall, on, the, most, inelastic, factor, involved, the, part, of, the, transaction, which, is, affected, least, by, a, change, in, price, so, for, instance, a, tax, on, wages, in, a, town, will, at, least, in, the, long, run, affect, property, owners, in, that, area, depending, on, how, quantities, supplied, and, demanded, to, vary, with, price, the, elasticities, of, supply, and, demand, a, tax, can, be, absorbed, by, the, seller, in, the, form, of, lower, pre, tax, prices, or, by, the, buyer, in, the, form, of, higher, post, tax, prices, if, the, elasticity, of, supply, is, low, more, of, the, tax, will, be, paid, by, the, supplier, if, the, elasticity, of, demand, is, low, more, will, be, paid, by, the, customer, and, contrariwise, for, the, cases, where, those, elasticities, are, high, if, the, seller, is, a, competitive, firm, the, tax, burden, is, distributed, over, the, factors, of, production, depending, on, the, elasticities, thereof, this, includes, workers, in, the, form, of, lower, wages, capital, investors, in, the, form, of, loss, to, shareholders, landowners, in, the, form, of, lower, rents, entrepreneurs, in, the, form, of, lower, wages, of, superintendence, and, customers, in, the, form, of, higher, prices, to, show, this, relationship, suppose, that, the, market, price, of, a, product, is, 1, 00, and, that, a, 0, 50, tax, is, imposed, on, the, product, that, by, law, is, to, be, collected, from, the, seller, if, the, product, has, an, elastic, demand, a, greater, portion, of, the, tax, will, be, absorbed, by, the, seller, this, is, because, goods, with, elastic, demand, cause, a, large, decline, in, quantity, demanded, a, small, increase, in, price, therefore, in, order, to, stabilize, sales, the, seller, absorbs, more, of, the, additional, tax, burden, for, example, the, seller, might, drop, the, price, of, the, product, to, 0, 70, so, that, after, adding, in, the, tax, the, buyer, pays, a, total, of, 1, 20, or, 0, 20, more, than, he, did, before, the, 0, 50, tax, was, imposed, in, this, example, the, buyer, has, paid, 0, 20, of, the, 0, 50, tax, in, the, form, of, a, post, tax, price, and, the, seller, has, paid, the, remaining, 0, 30, in, the, form, of, a, lower, pre, tax, price, the, purpose, of, taxation, is, to, provide, for, government, spending, without, inflation, the, provision, of, public, goods, such, as, roads, and, other, infrastructure, schools, a, social, safety, net, public, health, systems, national, defense, law, enforcement, and, a, courts, system, increases, the, economic, welfare, of, society, if, the, benefit, outweighs, the, costs, involved, the, existence, of, a, tax, can, increase, economic, efficiency, in, some, cases, if, there, is, a, negative, externality, associated, with, a, good, meaning, that, it, has, negative, effects, not, felt, by, the, consumer, then, a, free, market, will, trade, too, much, of, that, good, by, taxing, the, good, the, government, can, raise, revenue, to, address, specific, problems, while, increasing, overall, welfare, the, goal, is, to, tax, people, when, they, are, creating, societal, costs, in, addition, to, their, personal, costs, by, taxing, goods, with, negative, externalities, the, government, attempts, to, increase, economic, efficiency, while, raising, revenues, this, type, of, tax, is, called, a, pigovian, tax, after, economist, arthur, pigou, who, wrote, about, it, in, his, 1920, book, the, economics, of, welfare, pigovian, taxes, might, target, the, undesirable, production, of, greenhouse, gases, which, cause, climate, change, namely, a, carbon, tax, polluting, fuels, such, as, petrol, water, or, air, pollution, namely, an, ecotax, goods, which, incur, public, healthcare, costs, such, as, alcohol, or, tobacco, and, excess, demand, of, certain, public, goods, such, as, traffic, congestion, pricing, the, idea, is, to, aim, taxes, at, people, that, cause, an, above, average, amount, of, societal, harm, so, the, free, market, incorporates, all, costs, as, opposed, to, only, personal, costs, with, the, benefit, of, lowering, the, overall, tax, burden, for, people, who, cause, less, societal, harm, progressive, taxation, generally, reduces, economic, inequality, even, when, the, tax, revenue, is, not, redistributed, from, higher, income, individuals, to, lower, income, individuals, however, in, a, highly, specific, condition, progressive, taxation, increases, economic, inequality, when, lower, income, individuals, consume, goods, and, services, produced, by, higher, income, individuals, who, in, turn, consume, only, from, other, higher, income, individuals, trickle, up, effect, most, taxes, see, below, have, side, effects, that, reduce, economic, welfare, either, by, mandating, unproductive, labor, compliance, costs, or, by, creating, distortions, to, economic, incentives, deadweight, loss, and, perverse, incentives, although, governments, must, spend, money, on, tax, collection, activities, some, of, the, costs, particularly, for, keeping, records, and, filling, out, forms, are, borne, by, businesses, and, by, private, individuals, these, are, collectively, called, costs, of, compliance, more, complex, tax, systems, tend, to, have, higher, compliance, costs, this, fact, can, be, used, as, the, basis, for, practical, or, moral, arguments, in, favor, of, tax, simplification, such, as, the, fairtax, or, onetax, and, some, flat, tax, proposals, in, the, absence, of, negative, externalities, the, introduction, of, taxes, into, a, market, reduces, economic, efficiency, by, causing, deadweight, loss, in, a, competitive, market, the, price, of, a, particular, economic, good, adjusts, to, ensure, that, all, trades, which, benefit, both, the, buyer, and, the, seller, of, a, good, occur, the, introduction, of, a, tax, causes, the, price, received, by, the, seller, to, be, less, than, the, cost, to, the, buyer, by, the, amount, of, the, tax, this, causes, fewer, transactions, to, occur, which, reduces, economic, welfare, the, individuals, or, businesses, involved, are, less, well, off, than, before, the, tax, the, tax, burden, and, the, amount, of, deadweight, cost, is, dependent, on, the, elasticity, of, supply, and, demand, for, the, good, taxed, most, taxes, including, income, tax, and, sales, tax, can, have, significant, deadweight, costs, the, only, way, to, avoid, deadweight, costs, in, an, economy, that, is, generally, competitive, is, to, refrain, from, taxes, that, change, economic, incentives, such, taxes, include, the, land, value, tax, where, the, tax, is, on, a, good, in, completely, inelastic, supply, by, taxing, the, value, of, unimproved, land, as, opposed, to, what, s, built, on, it, a, land, value, tax, does, not, increase, taxes, on, landowners, for, improving, their, land, this, is, opposed, to, traditional, property, taxes, which, reward, land, abandonment, and, disincentivize, construction, maintenance, and, repair, another, example, of, a, tax, with, few, deadweight, costs, is, a, lump, sum, tax, such, as, a, poll, tax, head, tax, which, is, paid, by, all, adults, regardless, of, their, choices, arguably, a, windfall, profits, tax, which, is, entirely, unanticipated, can, also, fall, into, this, category, deadweight, loss, does, not, account, for, the, effect, taxes, have, in, leveling, the, business, playing, field, businesses, that, have, more, money, are, better, suited, to, fend, off, competition, it, is, common, that, an, industry, with, a, small, amount, of, very, large, corporations, has, a, very, high, barrier, of, entry, for, new, entrants, coming, into, the, marketplace, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, larger, the, corporation, the, better, its, position, to, negotiate, with, suppliers, also, larger, companies, may, be, able, to, operate, at, low, or, even, negative, profits, for, extended, periods, of, time, thus, pushing, out, competition, more, progressive, taxation, of, profits, however, would, reduce, such, barriers, for, new, entrants, thereby, increasing, competition, and, ultimately, benefiting, consumers, complexity, of, the, tax, code, in, developed, economies, offers, perverse, tax, incentives, the, more, details, of, tax, policy, there, are, the, more, opportunities, for, legal, tax, avoidance, and, illegal, tax, evasion, these, not, only, result, in, lost, revenue, but, involve, additional, costs, for, instance, payments, made, for, tax, advice, are, essentially, deadweight, costs, because, they, add, no, wealth, to, the, economy, perverse, incentives, also, occur, because, of, non, taxable, hidden, transactions, for, instance, a, sale, from, one, company, to, another, might, be, liable, for, sales, tax, but, if, the, same, goods, were, shipped, from, one, branch, of, a, corporation, to, another, no, tax, would, be, payable, to, address, these, issues, economists, often, suggest, simple, and, transparent, tax, structures, that, avoid, providing, loopholes, sales, tax, for, instance, can, be, replaced, with, a, value, added, tax, which, disregards, intermediate, transactions, following, nicolas, kaldor, s, research, public, finance, in, developing, countries, is, strongly, tied, to, state, capacity, and, financial, development, as, state, capacity, develops, states, not, only, increase, the, level, of, taxation, but, also, the, pattern, of, taxation, with, larger, tax, bases, and, the, diminishing, importance, of, trading, tax, income, tax, gains, more, importance, according, to, tilly, s, argument, state, capacity, evolves, as, a, response, to, the, emergence, of, war, war, is, an, incentive, for, states, to, raise, taxes, and, strengthen, states, capacity, historically, many, taxation, breakthroughs, took, place, during, wartime, the, introduction, of, income, tax, in, britain, was, due, to, the, napoleonic, war, in, 1798, the, us, first, introduced, income, tax, during, the, civil, war, taxation, is, constrained, by, the, fiscal, and, legal, capacities, of, a, country, fiscal, and, legal, capacities, also, complement, each, other, a, well, designed, tax, system, can, minimize, efficiency, loss, and, boost, economic, growth, with, better, compliance, and, better, support, to, financial, institutions, and, individual, property, the, government, will, be, able, to, collect, more, tax, although, wealthier, countries, have, higher, tax, revenue, economic, growth, does, not, always, translate, to, higher, tax, revenue, for, example, in, india, increases, in, exemptions, lead, to, the, stagnation, of, income, tax, revenue, at, around, 0, 5, of, gdp, since, 1986, researchers, for, eps, peaks, stated, that, the, core, purpose, of, taxation, is, revenue, mobilization, providing, resources, for, national, budgets, and, forming, an, important, part, of, macroeconomic, management, they, said, economic, theory, has, focused, on, the, need, to, optimize, the, system, through, balancing, efficiency, and, equity, understanding, the, impacts, on, production, and, consumption, as, well, as, distribution, redistribution, and, welfare, they, state, that, taxes, and, tax, relief, have, also, been, used, as, a, tool, for, behavioral, change, to, influence, investment, decisions, labor, supply, consumption, patterns, and, positive, and, negative, economic, spillovers, externalities, and, ultimately, the, promotion, of, economic, growth, and, development, the, tax, system, and, its, administration, also, play, an, important, role, in, state, building, and, governance, as, a, principal, form, of, social, contract, between, the, state, and, citizens, who, can, as, taxpayers, exert, accountability, on, the, state, as, a, consequence, the, researchers, wrote, that, domestic, revenue, forms, an, important, part, of, a, developing, country, s, public, financing, as, it, is, more, stable, and, predictable, than, overseas, development, assistance, and, necessary, for, a, country, to, be, self, sufficient, they, found, that, domestic, revenue, flows, are, on, average, already, much, larger, than, oda, with, aid, worth, less, than, 10, of, collected, taxes, in, africa, as, a, whole, however, in, a, quarter, of, african, countries, overseas, development, assistance, does, exceed, tax, collection, with, these, more, likely, to, be, non, resource, rich, countries, this, suggests, countries, making, the, most, progress, replacing, aid, with, tax, revenue, tend, to, be, those, benefiting, disproportionately, from, rising, prices, of, energy, and, commodities, the, author, found, tax, revenue, as, a, percentage, of, gdp, varying, greatly, around, a, global, average, of, 19, this, data, also, indicates, countries, with, higher, gdp, tend, to, have, higher, tax, to, gdp, ratios, demonstrating, that, higher, income, is, associated, with, more, than, proportionately, higher, tax, revenue, on, average, high, income, countries, have, tax, revenue, as, a, percentage, of, gdp, of, around, 22, compared, to, 18, in, middle, income, countries, and, 14, in, low, income, countries, in, high, income, countries, the, highest, tax, to, gdp, ratio, is, in, denmark, at, 47, and, the, lowest, is, in, kuwait, at, 0, 8, reflecting, low, taxes, from, strong, oil, revenues, the, long, term, average, performance, of, tax, revenue, as, a, share, of, gdp, in, low, income, countries, has, been, largely, stagnant, although, most, have, shown, some, improvement, in, more, recent, years, on, average, resource, rich, countries, have, made, the, most, progress, rising, from, 10, in, the, mid, 1990s, to, around, 17, in, 2008, non, resource, rich, countries, made, some, progress, with, average, tax, revenues, increasing, from, 10, to, 15, over, the, same, period, many, low, income, countries, have, a, tax, to, gdp, ratio, of, less, than, 15, which, could, be, due, to, low, tax, potentials, such, as, a, limited, taxable, economic, activity, or, low, tax, effort, due, to, policy, choice, non, compliance, or, administrative, constraints, some, low, income, countries, have, relatively, high, tax, to, gdp, ratios, due, to, resource, tax, revenues, e, g, angola, or, relatively, efficient, tax, administration, e, g, kenya, brazil, whereas, some, middle, income, countries, have, lower, tax, to, gdp, ratios, e, g, malaysia, which, reflect, a, more, tax, friendly, policy, choice, while, overall, tax, revenues, have, remained, broadly, constant, the, global, trend, shows, trade, taxes, have, been, declining, as, a, proportion, of, total, revenues, imf, 2011, with, the, share, of, revenue, shifting, away, from, border, trade, taxes, towards, domestically, levied, sales, taxes, on, goods, and, services, low, income, countries, tend, to, have, a, higher, dependence, on, trade, taxes, and, a, smaller, proportion, of, income, and, consumption, taxes, when, compared, to, high, income, countries, one, indicator, of, the, taxpaying, experience, was, captured, in, the, doing, business, survey, which, compares, the, total, tax, rate, time, spent, complying, with, tax, procedures, and, the, number, of, payments, required, through, the, year, across, 176, countries, the, easiest, countries, in, which, to, pay, taxes, are, located, in, the, middle, east, with, the, uae, ranking, first, followed, by, qatar, and, saudi, arabia, most, likely, reflecting, low, tax, regimes, in, those, countries, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, are, among, the, hardest, to, pay, with, the, central, african, republic, republic, of, congo, guinea, and, chad, in, the, bottom, 5, reflecting, higher, total, tax, rates, and, a, greater, administrative, burden, to, comply, the, below, facts, were, compiled, by, eps, peaks, researchers, aid, interventions, in, revenue, can, support, revenue, mobilization, for, growth, improve, tax, system, design, and, administrative, effectiveness, and, strengthen, governance, and, compliance, the, author, of, the, economics, topic, guide, found, that, the, best, aid, modalities, for, revenue, depend, on, country, circumstances, but, should, aim, to, align, with, government, interests, and, facilitate, effective, planning, and, implementation, of, activities, under, evidence, based, tax, reform, lastly, she, found, that, identifying, areas, for, further, reform, requires, country, specific, diagnostic, assessment, broad, areas, for, developing, countries, identified, internationally, e, g, imf, include, for, example, property, taxation, for, local, revenues, strengthening, expenditure, management, and, effective, taxation, of, extractive, industries, and, multinationals, every, tax, however, is, to, the, person, who, pays, it, a, badge, not, of, slavery, but, of, liberty, adam, smith, 1776, wealth, of, nations, according, to, most, political, philosophies, taxes, are, justified, as, they, fund, activities, that, are, necessary, and, beneficial, to, society, additionally, progressive, taxation, can, be, used, to, reduce, economic, inequality, in, a, society, according, to, this, view, taxation, in, modern, nation, states, benefit, the, majority, of, the, population, and, social, development, a, common, presentation, of, this, view, paraphrasing, various, statements, by, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, is, taxes, are, the, price, of, civilization, it, can, also, be, argued, that, in, a, democracy, because, the, government, is, the, party, performing, the, act, of, imposing, taxes, society, as, a, whole, decides, how, the, tax, system, should, be, organized, the, american, revolution, s, no, taxation, without, representation, slogan, implied, this, view, for, traditional, conservatives, the, payment, of, taxation, is, justified, as, part, of, the, general, obligations, of, citizens, to, obey, the, law, and, support, established, institutions, the, conservative, position, is, encapsulated, in, perhaps, the, most, famous, adage, of, public, finance, an, old, tax, is, a, good, tax, conservatives, advocate, the, fundamental, conservative, premise, that, no, one, should, be, excused, from, paying, for, government, lest, they, come, to, believe, that, government, is, costless, to, them, with, the, certain, consequence, that, they, will, demand, more, government, services, social, democrats, generally, favor, higher, levels, of, taxation, to, fund, public, provision, of, a, wide, range, of, services, such, as, universal, health, care, and, education, as, well, as, the, provision, of, a, range, of, welfare, benefits, as, argued, by, anthony, crosland, and, others, the, capacity, to, tax, income, from, capital, is, a, central, element, of, the, social, democratic, case, for, a, mixed, economy, as, against, marxist, arguments, for, comprehensive, public, ownership, of, capital, american, libertarians, recommend, a, minimal, level, of, taxation, in, order, to, maximize, the, protection, of, liberty, compulsory, taxation, of, individuals, such, as, income, tax, is, often, justified, on, grounds, including, territorial, sovereignty, and, the, social, contract, defenders, of, business, taxation, argue, that, it, is, an, efficient, method, of, taxing, income, that, ultimately, flows, to, individuals, or, that, separate, taxation, of, business, is, justified, on, the, grounds, that, commercial, activity, necessarily, involves, the, use, of, publicly, established, and, maintained, economic, infrastructure, and, that, businesses, are, in, effect, charged, for, this, use, georgist, economists, argue, that, all, of, the, economic, rent, collected, from, natural, resources, land, mineral, extraction, fishing, quotas, etc, is, unearned, income, and, belongs, to, the, community, rather, than, any, individual, they, advocate, a, high, tax, the, single, tax, on, land, and, other, natural, resources, to, return, this, unearned, income, to, the, state, but, no, other, taxes, because, payment, of, tax, is, compulsory, and, enforced, by, the, legal, system, rather, than, voluntary, like, crowdfunding, some, political, philosophies, view, taxation, as, theft, extortion, slavery, as, a, violation, of, property, rights, or, tyranny, accusing, the, government, of, levying, taxes, via, force, and, coercive, means, objectivists, anarcho, capitalists, and, right, wing, libertarians, see, taxation, as, government, aggression, through, the, lens, of, the, non, aggression, principle, the, view, that, democracy, legitimizes, taxation, is, rejected, by, those, who, argue, that, all, forms, of, government, including, laws, chosen, by, democratic, means, are, fundamentally, oppressive, according, to, ludwig, von, mises, society, as, a, whole, should, not, make, such, decisions, due, to, methodological, individualism, libertarian, opponents, of, taxation, claim, that, governmental, protection, such, as, police, and, defense, forces, might, be, replaced, by, market, alternatives, such, as, private, defense, agencies, arbitration, agencies, or, voluntary, contributions, murray, rothbard, argued, in, the, ethics, of, liberty, in, 1982, that, taxation, is, theft, and, that, tax, resistance, is, therefore, legitimate, just, as, no, one, is, morally, required, to, answer, a, robber, truthfully, when, he, asks, if, there, are, any, valuables, in, one, s, house, so, no, one, can, be, morally, required, to, answer, truthfully, similar, questions, asked, by, the, state, e, g, when, filling, out, income, tax, returns, many, view, government, spending, as, an, inefficient, use, of, capital, and, that, the, same, projects, that, the, government, seeks, to, develop, can, be, developed, by, private, companies, at, much, lower, costs, this, line, of, argument, holds, that, government, workers, are, not, as, personally, invested, in, the, efficiency, of, the, projects, so, the, overspending, happens, at, every, step, of, the, way, in, the, same, regard, many, public, officials, are, not, elected, for, their, project, management, skills, so, the, projects, can, be, mishandled, in, the, united, states, president, george, w, bush, proposed, in, his, 2009, budget, to, terminate, or, reduce, 151, discretionary, programs, which, were, inefficient, or, ineffective, additionally, critics, of, taxation, note, that, the, process, of, taxation, not, only, unjustly, takes, money, of, citizens, it, also, unjustly, takes, considerable, time, away, from, citizens, for, example, it, is, estimated, by, the, american, action, forum, that, americans, spend, 6, 5, billion, hours, annually, preparing, their, taxes, this, is, equivalent, of, roughly, 741, 501, years, of, life, lost, every, year, to, complete, tax, forms, and, other, related, paperwork, karl, marx, assumed, that, taxation, would, be, unnecessary, after, the, advent, of, communism, and, looked, forward, to, the, withering, away, of, the, state, in, socialist, economies, such, as, that, of, china, taxation, played, a, minor, role, since, most, government, income, was, derived, from, the, ownership, of, enterprises, and, it, was, argued, by, some, that, monetary, taxation, was, not, necessary, while, the, morality, of, taxation, is, sometimes, questioned, most, arguments, about, taxation, revolve, around, the, degree, and, method, of, taxation, and, associated, government, spending, not, taxation, itself, tax, choice, is, the, theory, that, taxpayers, should, have, more, control, with, how, their, individual, taxes, are, allocated, if, taxpayers, could, choose, which, government, organizations, received, their, taxes, opportunity, cost, decisions, would, integrate, their, partial, knowledge, for, example, a, taxpayer, who, allocated, more, of, his, taxes, on, public, education, would, have, less, to, allocate, on, public, healthcare, supporters, argue, that, allowing, taxpayers, to, demonstrate, their, preferences, would, help, ensure, that, the, government, succeeds, at, efficiently, producing, the, public, goods, that, taxpayers, truly, value, this, would, end, real, estate, speculation, business, cycles, unemployment, and, distribute, wealth, much, more, evenly, joseph, stiglitz, s, henry, george, theorem, predicts, its, sufficiency, because, as, george, also, noted, public, spending, raises, land, value, geoists, georgists, and, geolibertarians, state, that, taxation, should, primarily, collect, economic, rent, in, particular, the, value, of, land, for, both, reasons, of, economic, efficiency, as, well, as, morality, the, efficiency, of, using, economic, rent, for, taxation, is, as, economists, agree, due, to, the, fact, that, such, taxation, cannot, be, passed, on, and, does, not, create, any, dead, weight, loss, and, that, it, removes, the, incentive, to, speculate, on, land, its, morality, is, based, on, the, geoist, premise, that, private, property, is, justified, for, products, of, labor, but, not, for, land, and, natural, resources, economist, and, social, reformer, henry, george, opposed, sales, taxes, and, protective, tariffs, for, their, negative, impact, on, trade, he, also, believed, in, the, right, of, each, person, to, the, fruits, of, their, own, labor, and, productive, investment, therefore, income, from, paid, labor, and, proper, capital, should, remain, untaxed, for, this, reason, many, geoists, in, particular, those, that, call, themselves, geolibertarian, share, the, view, with, libertarians, that, these, types, of, taxation, but, not, all, are, immoral, and, even, theft, george, stated, there, should, be, one, single, tax, the, land, value, tax, which, is, considered, both, efficient, and, moral, demand, for, specific, land, is, dependent, on, nature, but, even, more, so, on, the, presence, of, communities, trade, and, government, infrastructure, particularly, in, urban, environments, therefore, the, economic, rent, of, land, is, not, the, product, of, one, particular, individual, and, it, may, be, claimed, for, public, expenses, according, to, george, this, would, end, real, estate, bubbles, business, cycles, unemployment, and, distribute, wealth, much, more, evenly, joseph, stiglitz, s, henry, george, theorem, predicts, its, sufficiency, for, financing, public, goods, because, those, raise, land, value, john, locke, stated, that, whenever, labor, is, mixed, with, natural, resources, such, as, is, the, case, with, improved, land, private, property, is, justified, under, the, proviso, that, there, must, be, enough, other, natural, resources, of, the, same, quality, available, to, others, geoists, state, that, the, lockean, proviso, is, violated, wherever, land, value, is, greater, than, zero, therefore, under, the, assumed, principle, of, equal, rights, of, all, people, to, natural, resources, the, occupier, of, any, such, land, must, compensate, the, rest, of, society, to, the, amount, of, that, value, for, this, reason, geoists, generally, believe, that, such, payment, cannot, be, regarded, as, a, true, tax, but, rather, a, compensation, or, fee, this, means, that, while, geoists, also, regard, taxation, as, an, instrument, of, social, justice, contrary, to, social, democrats, and, social, liberals, they, do, not, regard, it, as, an, instrument, of, redistribution, but, rather, a, predistribution, or, simply, a, correct, distribution, of, the, commons, modern, geoists, note, that, land, in, the, classical, economic, meaning, of, the, word, referred, to, all, natural, resources, and, thus, also, includes, resources, such, as, mineral, deposits, water, bodies, and, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, to, which, privileged, access, also, generates, economic, rent, that, must, be, compensated, under, the, same, reasoning, most, of, them, also, consider, pigouvian, taxes, as, compensation, for, environmental, damage, or, privilege, as, acceptable, and, even, necessary, in, economics, the, laffer, curve, is, a, theoretical, representation, of, the, relationship, between, government, revenue, raised, by, taxation, and, all, possible, rates, of, taxation, it, is, used, to, illustrate, the, concept, of, taxable, income, elasticity, that, taxable, income, will, change, in, response, to, changes, in, the, rate, of, taxation, the, curve, is, constructed, by, thought, experiment, first, the, amount, of, tax, revenue, raised, at, the, extreme, tax, rates, of, 0, and, 100, is, considered, it, is, clear, that, a, 0, tax, rate, raises, no, revenue, but, the, laffer, curve, hypothesis, is, that, a, 100, tax, rate, will, also, generate, no, revenue, because, at, such, a, rate, there, is, no, longer, any, incentive, for, a, rational, taxpayer, to, earn, any, income, thus, the, revenue, raised, will, be, 100, of, nothing, if, both, a, 0, rate, and, 100, rate, of, taxation, generate, no, revenue, it, follows, from, the, extreme, value, theorem, that, there, must, exist, at, least, one, rate, in, between, where, tax, revenue, would, be, a, maximum, the, laffer, curve, is, typically, represented, as, a, graph, that, starts, at, 0, tax, zero, revenue, rises, to, a, maximum, rate, of, revenue, raised, at, an, intermediate, rate, of, taxation, and, then, falls, again, to, zero, revenue, at, a, 100, tax, rate, one, potential, result, of, the, laffer, curve, is, that, increasing, tax, rates, beyond, a, certain, point, will, become, counterproductive, for, raising, further, tax, revenue, a, hypothetical, laffer, curve, for, any, given, economy, can, only, be, estimated, and, such, estimates, are, sometimes, controversial, the, new, palgrave, dictionary, of, economics, reports, that, estimates, of, revenue, maximizing, tax, rates, have, varied, widely, with, a, mid, range, of, around, 70, most, governments, take, revenue, that, exceeds, that, which, can, be, provided, by, non, distortionary, taxes, or, through, taxes, that, give, a, double, dividend, optimal, taxation, theory, is, the, branch, of, economics, that, considers, how, taxes, can, be, structured, to, give, the, least, deadweight, costs, or, to, give, the, best, outcomes, in, terms, of, social, welfare, the, ramsey, problem, deals, with, minimizing, deadweight, costs, because, deadweight, costs, are, related, to, the, elasticity, of, supply, and, demand, for, a, good, it, follows, that, putting, the, highest, tax, rates, on, the, goods, for, which, there, are, most, inelastic, supply, and, demand, will, result, in, the, least, overall, deadweight, costs, some, economists, sought, to, integrate, optimal, tax, theory, with, the, social, welfare, function, which, is, the, economic, expression, of, the, idea, that, equality, is, valuable, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, if, individuals, experience, diminishing, returns, from, income, then, the, optimum, distribution, of, income, for, society, involves, a, progressive, income, tax, mirrlees, optimal, income, tax, is, a, detailed, theoretical, model, of, the, optimum, progressive, income, tax, along, these, lines, over, the, last, years, the, validity, of, the, theory, of, optimal, taxation, was, discussed, by, many, political, economists, taxes, are, most, often, levied, as, a, percentage, called, the, tax, rate, an, important, distinction, when, talking, about, tax, rates, is, to, distinguish, between, the, marginal, rate, and, the, effective, tax, rate, the, effective, rate, is, the, total, tax, paid, divided, by, the, total, amount, the, tax, is, paid, on, while, the, marginal, rate, is, the, rate, paid, on, the, next, dollar, of, income, earned, for, example, if, income, is, taxed, on, a, formula, of, 5, from, 0, up, to, 50, 000, 10, from, 50, 000, to, 100, 000, and, 15, over, 100, 000, a, taxpayer, with, income, of, 175, 000, would, pay, a, total, of, 18, 750, in, taxes
