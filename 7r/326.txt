https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable
a, syllable, is, a, unit, of, organization, for, a, sequence, of, speech, sounds, typically, made, up, of, a, syllable, nucleus, most, often, a, vowel, with, optional, initial, and, final, margins, typically, consonants, syllables, are, often, considered, the, phonological, building, blocks, of, words, they, can, influence, the, rhythm, of, a, language, its, prosody, its, poetic, metre, and, its, stress, patterns, speech, can, usually, be, divided, up, into, a, whole, number, of, syllables, for, example, the, word, ignite, is, made, of, two, syllables, ig, and, nite, syllabic, writing, began, several, hundred, years, before, the, first, letters, the, earliest, recorded, syllables, are, on, tablets, written, around, 2800, bc, in, the, sumerian, city, of, ur, this, shift, from, pictograms, to, syllables, has, been, called, the, most, important, advance, in, the, history, of, writing, a, word, that, consists, of, a, single, syllable, like, english, dog, is, called, a, monosyllable, and, is, said, to, be, monosyllabic, similar, terms, include, disyllable, and, disyllabic, also, bisyllable, and, bisyllabic, for, a, word, of, two, syllables, trisyllable, and, trisyllabic, for, a, word, of, three, syllables, and, polysyllable, and, polysyllabic, which, may, refer, either, to, a, word, of, more, than, three, syllables, or, to, any, word, of, more, than, one, syllable, syllable, is, an, anglo, norman, variation, of, old, french, sillabe, from, latin, syllaba, from, koine, greek, syllab, greek, pronunciation, means, the, taken, together, referring, to, letters, that, are, taken, together, to, make, a, single, sound, is, a, verbal, noun, from, the, verb, syllamb, n, a, compound, of, the, preposition, s, n, with, and, the, verb, lamb, n, take, the, noun, uses, the, root, which, appears, in, the, aorist, tense, the, present, tense, stem, is, formed, by, adding, a, nasal, infix, m, before, the, b, and, a, suffix, an, at, the, end, in, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, the, fullstop, marks, syllable, breaks, as, in, the, word, astronomical, s, tr, n, m, k, l, in, practice, however, ipa, transcription, is, typically, divided, into, words, by, spaces, and, often, these, spaces, are, also, understood, to, be, syllable, breaks, in, addition, the, stress, mark, is, placed, immediately, before, a, stressed, syllable, and, when, the, stressed, syllable, is, in, the, middle, of, a, word, in, practice, the, stress, mark, also, marks, a, syllable, break, for, example, in, the, word, understood, nd, r, st, d, though, the, syllable, boundary, may, still, be, explicitly, marked, with, a, full, stop, e, g, n, d, r, st, d, when, a, word, space, comes, in, the, middle, of, a, syllable, that, is, when, a, syllable, spans, words, a, tie, bar, can, be, used, for, liaison, as, in, the, french, combination, les, amis, l, z, a, mi, the, liaison, tie, is, also, used, to, join, lexical, words, into, phonological, words, for, example, hot, dog, h, t, d, a, greek, sigma, is, used, as, a, wild, card, for, syllable, and, a, dollar, peso, sign, marks, a, syllable, boundary, where, the, usual, fullstop, might, be, misunderstood, for, example, is, a, pair, of, syllables, and, v, is, a, syllable, final, vowel, in, the, typical, theory, of, syllable, structure, the, general, structure, of, a, syllable, consists, of, three, segments, these, segments, are, grouped, into, two, components, the, syllable, is, usually, considered, right, branching, i, e, nucleus, and, coda, are, grouped, together, as, a, rime, and, are, only, distinguished, at, the, second, level, the, nucleus, is, usually, the, vowel, in, the, middle, of, a, syllable, the, onset, is, the, sound, or, sounds, occurring, before, the, nucleus, and, the, coda, literally, tail, is, the, sound, or, sounds, that, follow, the, nucleus, they, are, sometimes, collectively, known, as, the, shell, the, term, rime, covers, the, nucleus, plus, coda, in, the, one, syllable, english, word, cat, the, nucleus, is, a, the, sound, that, can, be, shouted, or, sung, on, its, own, the, onset, c, the, coda, t, and, the, rime, at, this, syllable, can, be, abstracted, as, a, consonant, vowel, consonant, syllable, abbreviated, cvc, languages, vary, greatly, in, the, restrictions, on, the, sounds, making, up, the, onset, nucleus, and, coda, of, a, syllable, according, to, what, is, termed, a, language, s, phonotactics, although, every, syllable, has, supra, segmental, features, these, are, usually, ignored, if, not, semantically, relevant, e, g, in, tonal, languages, in, the, syllable, structure, of, sinitic, languages, the, onset, is, replaced, with, an, initial, and, a, semivowel, or, liquid, forms, another, segment, called, the, medial, these, four, segments, are, grouped, into, two, slightly, different, components, in, many, languages, of, the, mainland, southeast, asia, linguistic, area, such, as, chinese, the, syllable, structure, is, expanded, to, include, an, additional, optional, medial, segment, located, between, the, onset, often, termed, the, initial, in, this, context, and, the, rime, the, medial, is, normally, a, semivowel, but, reconstructions, of, old, chinese, generally, include, liquid, medials, r, in, modern, reconstructions, l, in, older, versions, and, many, reconstructions, of, middle, chinese, include, a, medial, contrast, between, i, and, j, where, the, i, functions, phonologically, as, a, glide, rather, than, as, part, of, the, nucleus, in, addition, many, reconstructions, of, both, old, and, middle, chinese, include, complex, medials, such, as, rj, ji, jw, and, jwi, the, medial, groups, phonologically, with, the, rime, rather, than, the, onset, and, the, combination, of, medial, and, rime, is, collectively, known, as, the, final, some, linguists, especially, when, discussing, the, modern, chinese, varieties, use, the, terms, final, and, rime, interchangeably, in, historical, chinese, phonology, however, the, distinction, between, final, including, the, medial, and, rime, not, including, the, medial, is, important, in, understanding, the, rime, dictionaries, and, rime, tables, that, form, the, primary, sources, for, middle, chinese, and, as, a, result, most, authors, distinguish, the, two, according, to, the, above, definition, in, some, theories, of, phonology, syllable, structures, are, displayed, as, tree, diagrams, similar, to, the, trees, found, in, some, types, of, syntax, not, all, phonologists, agree, that, syllables, have, internal, structure, in, fact, some, phonologists, doubt, the, existence, of, the, syllable, as, a, theoretical, entity, there, are, many, arguments, for, a, hierarchical, relationship, rather, than, a, linear, one, between, the, syllable, constituents, one, hierarchical, model, groups, the, syllable, nucleus, and, coda, into, an, intermediate, level, the, rime, the, hierarchical, model, accounts, for, the, role, that, the, nucleus, coda, constituent, plays, in, verse, i, e, rhyming, words, such, as, cat, and, bat, are, formed, by, matching, both, the, nucleus, and, coda, or, the, entire, rime, and, for, the, distinction, between, heavy, and, light, syllables, which, plays, a, role, in, phonological, processes, such, as, for, example, sound, change, in, old, english, scipu, and, wordu, where, in, a, process, called, high, vowel, deletion, hvd, the, nominative, accusative, plural, of, single, light, syllable, roots, like, scip, got, a, u, ending, in, oe, whereas, heavy, syllable, roots, like, word, would, not, giving, scip, u, but, word, in, some, traditional, descriptions, of, certain, languages, such, as, cree, and, ojibwe, the, syllable, is, considered, left, branching, i, e, onset, and, nucleus, group, below, a, higher, level, unit, called, a, body, or, core, this, contrasts, with, the, coda, the, rime, or, rhyme, of, a, syllable, consists, of, a, nucleus, and, an, optional, coda, it, is, the, part, of, the, syllable, used, in, most, poetic, rhymes, and, the, part, that, is, lengthened, or, stressed, when, a, person, elongates, or, stresses, a, word, in, speech, the, rime, is, usually, the, portion, of, a, syllable, from, the, first, vowel, to, the, end, for, example, t, is, the, rime, of, all, of, the, words, at, sat, and, flat, however, the, nucleus, does, not, necessarily, need, to, be, a, vowel, in, some, languages, such, as, english, for, instance, the, rime, of, the, second, syllables, of, the, words, bottle, and, fiddle, is, just, l, a, liquid, consonant, just, as, the, rime, branches, into, the, nucleus, and, coda, the, nucleus, and, coda, may, each, branch, into, multiple, phonemes, the, limit, for, the, number, of, phonemes, which, may, be, contained, in, each, varies, by, language, for, example, japanese, and, most, sino, tibetan, languages, do, not, have, consonant, clusters, at, the, beginning, or, end, of, syllables, whereas, many, eastern, european, languages, can, have, more, than, two, consonants, at, the, beginning, or, end, of, the, syllable, in, english, the, onset, may, have, up, to, three, consonants, and, the, coda, four, rime, and, rhyme, are, variants, of, the, same, word, but, the, rarer, form, rime, is, sometimes, used, to, mean, specifically, syllable, rime, to, differentiate, it, from, the, concept, of, poetic, rhyme, this, distinction, is, not, made, by, some, linguists, and, does, not, appear, in, most, dictionaries, a, heavy, syllable, is, generally, one, with, a, branching, rime, i, e, it, is, either, a, closed, syllable, that, ends, in, a, consonant, or, a, syllable, with, a, branching, nucleus, i, e, a, long, vowel, or, diphthong, the, name, is, a, metaphor, based, on, the, nucleus, or, coda, having, lines, that, branch, in, a, tree, diagram, in, some, languages, heavy, syllables, include, both, vv, branching, nucleus, and, vc, branching, rime, syllables, contrasted, with, v, which, is, a, light, syllable, in, other, languages, only, vv, syllables, are, considered, heavy, while, both, vc, and, v, syllables, are, light, some, languages, distinguish, a, third, type, of, superheavy, syllable, which, consists, of, vvc, syllables, with, both, a, branching, nucleus, and, rime, or, vcc, syllables, with, a, coda, consisting, of, two, or, more, consonants, or, both, in, moraic, theory, heavy, syllables, are, said, to, have, two, moras, while, light, syllables, are, said, to, have, one, and, superheavy, syllables, are, said, to, have, three, japanese, phonology, is, generally, described, this, way, many, languages, forbid, superheavy, syllables, while, a, significant, number, forbid, any, heavy, syllable, some, languages, strive, for, constant, syllable, weight, for, example, in, stressed, non, final, syllables, in, italian, short, vowels, co, occur, with, closed, syllables, while, long, vowels, co, occur, with, open, syllables, so, that, all, such, syllables, are, heavy, not, light, or, superheavy, the, difference, between, heavy, and, light, frequently, determines, which, syllables, receive, stress, this, is, the, case, in, latin, and, arabic, for, example, the, system, of, poetic, meter, in, many, classical, languages, such, as, classical, greek, classical, latin, old, tamil, and, sanskrit, is, based, on, syllable, weight, rather, than, stress, so, called, quantitative, rhythm, or, quantitative, meter, syllabification, is, the, separation, of, a, word, into, syllables, whether, spoken, or, written, in, most, languages, the, actually, spoken, syllables, are, the, basis, of, syllabification, in, writing, too, due, to, the, very, weak, correspondence, between, sounds, and, letters, in, the, spelling, of, modern, english, for, example, written, syllabification, in, english, has, to, be, based, mostly, on, etymological, i, e, morphological, instead, of, phonetic, principles, english, written, syllables, therefore, do, not, correspond, to, the, actually, spoken, syllables, of, the, living, language, phonotactic, rules, determine, which, sounds, are, allowed, or, disallowed, in, each, part, of, the, syllable, english, allows, very, complicated, syllables, syllables, may, begin, with, up, to, three, consonants, as, in, strength, and, occasionally, end, with, as, many, as, four, as, in, angsts, pronounced, many, other, languages, are, much, more, restricted, japanese, for, example, only, allows, and, a, chroneme, in, a, coda, and, theoretically, has, no, consonant, clusters, at, all, as, the, onset, is, composed, of, at, most, one, consonant, the, linking, of, a, word, final, consonant, to, a, vowel, beginning, the, word, immediately, following, it, forms, a, regular, part, of, the, phonetics, of, some, languages, including, spanish, hungarian, and, turkish, thus, in, spanish, the, phrase, los, hombres, the, men, is, pronounced, hungarian, az, ember, the, human, as, and, turkish, nefret, ettim, i, hated, it, as, in, italian, a, final, sound, can, be, moved, to, the, next, syllable, in, enchainement, sometimes, with, a, gemination, e, g, non, ne, ho, mai, avuti, i, ve, never, had, any, of, them, is, broken, into, syllables, as, and, io, ci, vado, e, lei, anche, i, go, there, and, she, does, as, well, is, realized, as, a, related, phenomenon, called, consonant, mutation, is, found, in, the, celtic, languages, like, irish, and, welsh, whereby, unwritten, but, historical, final, consonants, affect, the, initial, consonant, of, the, following, word, there, can, be, disagreement, about, the, location, of, some, divisions, between, syllables, in, spoken, language, the, problems, of, dealing, with, such, cases, have, been, most, commonly, discussed, with, relation, to, english, in, the, case, of, a, word, such, as, hurry, the, division, may, be, h, r, i, or, h, ri, neither, of, which, seems, a, satisfactory, analysis, for, a, non, rhotic, accent, such, as, rp, british, english, h, r, i, results, in, a, syllable, final, r, which, is, not, normally, found, while, h, ri, gives, a, syllable, final, short, stressed, vowel, which, is, also, non, occurring, arguments, can, be, made, in, favour, of, one, solution, or, the, other, a, general, rule, has, been, proposed, that, states, that, subject, to, certain, conditions, consonants, are, syllabified, with, the, more, strongly, stressed, of, two, flanking, syllables, while, many, other, phonologists, prefer, to, divide, syllables, with, the, consonant, or, consonants, attached, to, the, following, syllable, wherever, possible, however, an, alternative, that, has, received, some, support, is, to, treat, an, intervocalic, consonant, as, ambisyllabic, i, e, belonging, both, to, the, preceding, and, to, the, following, syllable, h, i, this, is, discussed, in, more, detail, in, english, phonology, phonotactics, the, onset, also, known, as, anlaut, is, the, consonant, sound, or, sounds, at, the, beginning, of, a, syllable, occurring, before, the, nucleus, most, syllables, have, an, onset, syllables, without, an, onset, may, be, said, to, have, an, empty, or, zero, onset, that, is, nothing, where, the, onset, would, be, some, languages, restrict, onsets, to, be, only, a, single, consonant, while, others, allow, multiconsonant, onsets, according, to, various, rules, for, example, in, english, onsets, such, as, pr, pl, and, tr, are, possible, but, tl, is, not, and, sk, is, possible, but, ks, is, not, in, greek, however, both, ks, and, tl, are, possible, onsets, while, contrarily, in, classical, arabic, no, multiconsonant, onsets, are, allowed, at, all, some, languages, forbid, null, onsets, in, these, languages, words, beginning, in, a, vowel, like, the, english, word, at, are, impossible, this, is, less, strange, than, it, may, appear, at, first, as, most, such, languages, allow, syllables, to, begin, with, a, phonemic, glottal, stop, the, sound, in, the, middle, of, english, uh, oh, or, in, some, dialects, the, double, t, in, button, represented, in, the, ipa, as, in, english, a, word, that, begins, with, a, vowel, may, be, pronounced, with, an, epenthetic, glottal, stop, when, following, a, pause, though, the, glottal, stop, may, not, be, a, phoneme, in, the, language, few, languages, make, a, phonemic, distinction, between, a, word, beginning, with, a, vowel, and, a, word, beginning, with, a, glottal, stop, followed, by, a, vowel, since, the, distinction, will, generally, only, be, audible, following, another, word, however, maltese, and, some, polynesian, languages, do, make, such, a, distinction, as, in, hawaiian, ahi, fire, and, ahi, kahi, tuna, and, maltese, arabic, h, and, maltese, k, arabic, q, ashkenazi, and, sephardi, hebrew, may, commonly, ignore, and, and, arabic, forbid, empty, onsets, the, names, israel, abel, abraham, omar, abdullah, and, iraq, appear, not, to, have, onsets, in, the, first, syllable, but, in, the, original, hebrew, and, arabic, forms, they, actually, begin, with, various, consonants, the, semivowel, j, in, yisra, l, the, glottal, fricative, in, h, he, el, the, glottal, stop, in, a, r, h, m, or, the, pharyngeal, fricative, in, umar, abdu, ll, h, and, ir, q, conversely, the, arrernte, language, of, central, australia, may, prohibit, onsets, altogether, if, so, all, syllables, have, the, underlying, shape, vc, c, the, difference, between, a, syllable, with, a, null, onset, and, one, beginning, with, a, glottal, stop, is, often, purely, a, difference, of, phonological, analysis, rather, than, the, actual, pronunciation, of, the, syllable, in, some, cases, the, pronunciation, of, a, putatively, vowel, initial, word, when, following, another, word, particularly, whether, or, not, a, glottal, stop, is, inserted, indicates, whether, the, word, should, be, considered, to, have, a, null, onset, for, example, many, romance, languages, such, as, spanish, never, insert, such, a, glottal, stop, while, english, does, so, only, some, of, the, time, depending, on, factors, such, as, conversation, speed, in, both, cases, this, suggests, that, the, words, in, question, are, truly, vowel, initial, but, there, are, exceptions, here, too, for, example, standard, german, excluding, many, southern, accents, and, arabic, both, require, that, a, glottal, stop, be, inserted, between, a, word, and, a, following, putatively, vowel, initial, word, yet, such, words, are, perceived, to, begin, with, a, vowel, in, german, but, a, glottal, stop, in, arabic, the, reason, for, this, has, to, do, with, other, properties, of, the, two, languages, for, example, a, glottal, stop, does, not, occur, in, other, situations, in, german, e, g, before, a, consonant, or, at, the, end, of, word, on, the, other, hand, in, arabic, not, only, does, a, glottal, stop, occur, in, such, situations, e, g, classical, sa, ala, he, asked, ra, j, opinion, d, aw, light, but, it, occurs, in, alternations, that, are, clearly, indicative, of, its, phonemic, status, cf, classical, ka, tib, writer, vs, mak, tu, b, written, a, kil, eater, vs, ma, ku, l, eaten, in, other, words, while, the, glottal, stop, is, predictable, in, german, inserted, only, if, a, stressed, syllable, would, otherwise, begin, with, a, vowel, the, same, sound, is, a, regular, consonantal, phoneme, in, arabic, the, status, of, this, consonant, in, the, respective, writing, systems, corresponds, to, this, difference, there, is, no, reflex, of, the, glottal, stop, in, german, orthography, but, there, is, a, letter, in, the, arabic, alphabet, hamza, the, writing, system, of, a, language, may, not, correspond, with, the, phonological, analysis, of, the, language, in, terms, of, its, handling, of, potentially, null, onsets, for, example, in, some, languages, written, in, the, latin, alphabet, an, initial, glottal, stop, is, left, unwritten, see, the, german, example, on, the, other, hand, some, languages, written, using, non, latin, alphabets, such, as, abjads, and, abugidas, have, a, special, zero, consonant, to, represent, a, null, onset, as, an, example, in, hangul, the, alphabet, of, the, korean, language, a, null, onset, is, represented, with, at, the, left, or, top, section, of, a, grapheme, as, in, station, pronounced, yeok, where, the, diphthong, yeo, is, the, nucleus, and, k, is, the, coda, the, nucleus, is, usually, the, vowel, in, the, middle, of, a, syllable, generally, every, syllable, requires, a, nucleus, sometimes, called, the, peak, and, the, minimal, syllable, consists, only, of, a, nucleus, as, in, the, english, words, eye, or, owe, the, syllable, nucleus, is, usually, a, vowel, in, the, form, of, a, monophthong, diphthong, or, triphthong, but, sometimes, is, a, syllabic, consonant, in, most, germanic, languages, lax, vowels, can, occur, only, in, closed, syllables, therefore, these, vowels, are, also, called, checked, vowels, as, opposed, to, the, tense, vowels, that, are, called, free, vowels, because, they, can, occur, even, in, open, syllables, the, notion, of, syllable, is, challenged, by, languages, that, allow, long, strings, of, obstruents, without, any, intervening, vowel, or, sonorant, by, far, the, most, common, syllabic, consonants, are, sonorants, like, or, as, in, english, bott, le, ch, ur, ch, in, rhotic, accents, rhyth, m, butt, on, and, lock, n, key, however, english, allows, syllabic, obstruents, in, a, few, para, verbal, onomatopoeic, utterances, such, as, shh, used, to, command, silence, and, psst, used, to, attract, attention, all, of, these, have, been, analyzed, as, phonemically, syllabic, obstruent, only, syllables, also, occur, phonetically, in, some, prosodic, situations, when, unstressed, vowels, elide, between, obstruents, as, in, potato, and, today, which, do, not, change, in, their, number, of, syllables, despite, losing, a, syllabic, nucleus, a, few, languages, have, so, called, syllabic, fricatives, also, known, as, fricative, vowels, at, the, phonemic, level, in, the, context, of, chinese, phonology, the, related, but, non, synonymous, term, apical, vowel, is, commonly, used, mandarin, chinese, is, famous, for, having, such, sounds, in, at, least, some, of, its, dialects, for, example, the, pinyin, syllables, s, sh, r, usually, pronounced, respectively, though, like, the, nucleus, of, rhotic, english, church, there, is, debate, over, whether, these, nuclei, are, consonants, or, vowels, languages, of, the, northwest, coast, of, north, america, including, salishan, wakashan, and, chinookan, languages, allow, stop, consonants, and, voiceless, fricatives, as, syllables, at, the, phonemic, level, in, even, the, most, careful, enunciation, an, example, is, chinook, those, two, women, are, coming, this, way, out, of, the, water, linguists, have, analyzed, this, situation, in, various, ways, some, arguing, that, such, syllables, have, no, nucleus, at, all, and, some, arguing, that, the, concept, of, syllable, cannot, clearly, be, applied, at, all, to, these, languages, other, examples, in, bagemihl, s, survey, of, previous, analyses, he, finds, that, the, bella, coola, word, t, s, ktsk, t, s, he, arrived, would, have, been, parsed, into, 0, 2, 3, 5, or, 6, syllables, depending, on, which, analysis, is, used, one, analysis, would, consider, all, vowel, and, consonant, segments, as, syllable, nuclei, another, would, consider, only, a, small, subset, fricatives, or, sibilants, as, nuclei, candidates, and, another, would, simply, deny, the, existence, of, syllables, completely, however, when, working, with, recordings, rather, than, transcriptions, the, syllables, can, be, obvious, in, such, languages, and, native, speakers, have, strong, intuitions, as, to, what, the, syllables, are, this, type, of, phenomenon, has, also, been, reported, in, berber, languages, such, as, indlawn, tashlhiyt, berber, mon, khmer, languages, such, as, semai, temiar, khmu, and, the, gami, dialect, of, miyako, a, ryukyuan, language, the, coda, also, known, as, auslaut, comprises, the, consonant, sounds, of, a, syllable, that, follow, the, nucleus, the, sequence, of, nucleus, and, coda, is, called, a, rime, some, syllables, consist, of, only, a, nucleus, only, an, onset, and, a, nucleus, with, no, coda, or, only, a, nucleus, and, coda, with, no, onset, the, phonotactics, of, many, languages, forbid, syllable, codas, examples, are, swahili, and, hawaiian, in, others, codas, are, restricted, to, a, small, subset, of, the, consonants, that, appear, in, onset, position, at, a, phonemic, level, in, japanese, for, example, a, coda, may, only, be, a, nasal, homorganic, with, any, following, consonant, or, in, the, middle, of, a, word, gemination, of, the, following, consonant, on, a, phonetic, level, other, codas, occur, due, to, elision, of, i, and, u, in, other, languages, nearly, any, consonant, allowed, as, an, onset, is, also, allowed, in, the, coda, even, clusters, of, consonants, in, english, for, example, all, onset, consonants, except, h, are, allowed, as, syllable, codas, if, the, coda, consists, of, a, consonant, cluster, the, sonority, typically, decreases, from, first, to, last, as, in, the, english, word, help, this, is, called, the, sonority, hierarchy, or, sonority, scale, english, onset, and, coda, clusters, are, therefore, different, the, onset, str, in, strengths, does, not, appear, as, a, coda, in, any, english, word, however, some, clusters, do, occur, as, both, onsets, and, codas, such, as, st, in, stardust, the, sonority, hierarchy, is, more, strict, in, some, languages, and, less, strict, in, others, a, coda, less, syllable, of, the, form, v, cv, ccv, etc, v, vowel, c, consonant, is, called, an, open, syllable, or, free, syllable, while, a, syllable, that, has, a, coda, vc, cvc, cvcc, etc, is, called, a, closed, syllable, or, checked, syllable, they, have, nothing, to, do, with, open, and, close, vowels, but, are, defined, according, to, the, phoneme, that, ends, the, syllable, a, vowel, open, syllable, or, a, consonant, closed, syllable, almost, all, languages, allow, open, syllables, but, some, such, as, hawaiian, do, not, have, closed, syllables, when, a, syllable, is, not, the, last, syllable, in, a, word, the, nucleus, normally, must, be, followed, by, two, consonants, in, order, for, the, syllable, to, be, closed, this, is, because, a, single, following, consonant, is, typically, considered, the, onset, of, the, following, syllable, for, example, spanish, casar, to, marry, is, composed, of, an, open, syllable, followed, by, a, closed, syllable, ca, sar, whereas, cansar, to, get, tired, is, composed, of, two, closed, syllables, can, sar, when, a, geminate, double, consonant,

syllable, or, some, larger, unit, but, not, a, specific, sound, that, is, to, say, these, features, may, effect, more, than, a, single, segment, and, possibly, all, segments, of, a, syllable, sometimes, syllable, length, is, also, counted, as, a, suprasegmental, feature, for, example, in, some, germanic, languages, long, vowels, may, only, exist, with, short, consonants, and, vice, versa, however, syllables, can, be, analyzed, as, compositions, of, long, and, short, phonemes, as, in, finnish, and, japanese, where, consonant, gemination, and, vowel, length, are, independent, in, most, languages, the, pitch, or, pitch, contour, in, which, a, syllable, is, pronounced, conveys, shades, of, meaning, such, as, emphasis, or, surprise, or, distinguishes, a, statement, from, a, question, in, tonal, languages, however, the, pitch, affects, the, basic, lexical, meaning, e, g, cat, vs, dog, or, grammatical, meaning, e, g, past, vs, present, in, some, languages, only, the, pitch, itself, e, g, high, vs, low, has, this, effect, while, in, others, especially, east, asian, languages, such, as, chinese, thai, or, vietnamese, the, shape, or, contour, e, g, level, vs, rising, vs, falling,
