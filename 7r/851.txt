majority, of, the, agricultural, labour, force, in, a, pre, industrial, society, the, majority, of, the, people, according, to, one, estimate, 85, of, the, population, in, the, middle, ages, were, peasants, though, peasant, is, a, word, of, loose, application, once, a, market, economy, had, taken, root, the, term, peasant, proprietors, was, frequently, used, to, describe, the, traditional,

wake, of, this, disruption, to, the, established, order, it, became, more, productive, for, many, laborers, to, demand, wages, and, other, alternative, forms, of, compensation, which, ultimately, led, to, the, development, of, widespread, literacy, and, the, enormous, social, and, intellectual, changes, of, the, enlightenment, the, evolution, of, ideas, in, an, environment, of, relatively, widespread, literacy, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, industrial, revolution, which, enabled, mechanically, and, chemically, augmented, agricultural, production, while, simultaneously, increasing, the, demand, for, factory, workers, in, cities, who, became, what, karl, marx, called, the, proletariat, the, trend, toward, individual, ownership, of, land, typified, in, england, by, enclosure, displaced, many, peasants, from, the, land, and, compelled, them, often, unwillingly, to, become, urban, factory, workers, who, came, to, occupy, the, socio, economic, stratum, formerly, the, preserve, of, the, medieval, peasants, this, process, happened, in, an, especially, pronounced, and, truncated, way, in, eastern, europe, lacking, any, catalysts, for, change, in, the, 14th, century, eastern, european, peasants, largely, continued, upon, the, original, medieval, path, until, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, serfdom, was, abolished, in, russia, in, 1861, and, while, many, peasants, would, remain, in, areas, where, their, family, had, farmed, for, generations, the, changes, did, allow, for, the, buying, and, selling, of, lands, traditionally, held, by, peasants, and, for, landless, ex, peasants, to, move, to, the, cities, even, before, emancipation, in, 1861, serfdom, was, on, the, wane, in, russia, the, proportion, of, serfs, within, the, empire, had, gradually, decreased, from, 45, 50, percent, at, the, end, of, the, eighteenth, century, to, 37, 7, percent, in, 1858, in, germany, peasants, continued, to, center, their, lives, in, the, village, well, into, the, 19th, century, they, belonged, to, a, corporate, body, and, helped, to, manage, the, community, resources, and, to, monitor, community, life, in, the, east, they, had, the, status, of, serfs, bound, permanently, to, parcels, of, land, a, peasant, is, called, a, bauer, in, german, and, bur, in, low, german, pronounced, in, english, like, boor, in, most, of, germany, farming, was, handled, by, tenant, farmers, who, paid, rents, and, obligatory, services, to, the, landlord, typically, a, nobleman, peasant, leaders, supervised, the, fields, and, ditches, and, grazing, rights, maintained, public, order, and, morals, and, supported, a, village, court, which, handled, minor, offenses, inside, the, family, the, patriarch, made, all, the, decisions, and, tried, to, arrange, advantageous, marriages, for, his, children, much, of, the, villages, communal, life, centered, on, church, services, and, holy, days, in, prussia, the, peasants, drew, lots, to, choose, conscripts, required, by, the, army, the, noblemen, handled, external, relationships, and, politics, for, the, villages, under, their, control, and, were, not, typically, involved, in, daily, activities, or, decisions, information, about, the, complexities, of, the, french, revolution, especially, the, fast, changing, scene, in, paris, reached, isolated, areas, through, both, official, announcements, and, long, established, oral, networks, peasants, responded, differently, to, different, sources, of, information, the, limits, on, political, knowledge, in, these, areas, depended, more, on, how, much, peasants, chose, to, know, than, on, bad, roads, or, illiteracy, historian, jill, maciak, concludes, that, peasants, were, neither, subservient, reactionary, nor, ignorant, in, his, seminal, book, peasants, into, frenchmen, the, modernization, of, rural, france, 1880, 1914, 1976, historian, eugen, weber, traced, the, modernization, of, french, villages, and, argued, that, rural, france, went, from, backward, and, isolated, to, modern, and, possessing, a, sense, of, french, nationhood, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, he, emphasized, the, roles, of, railroads, republican, schools, and, universal, military, conscription, he, based, his, findings, on, school, records, migration, patterns, military, service, documents, and, economic, trends, weber, argued, that, until, 1900, or, so, a, sense, of, french, nationhood, was, weak, in, the, provinces, weber, then, looked, at, how, the, policies, of, the, third, republic, created, a, sense, of, french, nationality, in, rural, areas, the, book, was, widely, praised, but, some, argued, that, a, sense, of, frenchness, existed, in, the, provinces, before, 1870, farmers, in, china, have, been, sometimes, referred, to, as, peasants, in, english, language, sources, however, the, traditional, term, for, farmer, nongfu, simply, refers, to, farmer, or, agricultural, worker, in, the, 19th, century, japanese, intellectuals, reinvented, the, chinese, terms, fengjian, for, feudalism, and, nongmin, or, farming, people, terms, used, in, the, description, of, feudal, japanese, society, these, terms, created, a, negative, image, of, chinese, farmers, by, making, a, class, distinction, where, one, had, not, previously, existed, anthropologist, myron, cohen, considers, these, terms, to, be, neologisms, that, represented, a, cultural, and, political, invention, he, writes, this, divide, represented, a, radical, departure, from, tradition, f, w, mote, and, others, have, shown, how, especially, during, the, later, imperial, era, ming, and, qing, dynasties, china, was, notable, for, the, cultural, social, political, and, economic, interpenetration, of, city, and, countryside, but, the, term, nongmin, did, enter, china, in, association, with, marxist, and, non, marxist, western, perceptions, of, the, peasant, thereby, putting, the, full, weight, of, the, western, heritage, to, use, in, a, new, and, sometimes, harshly, negative, representation, of, china, s, rural, population, likewise, with, this, development, westerners, found, it, all, the, more, natural, to, apply, their, own, historically, derived, images, of, the, peasant, to, what, they, observed, or, were, told, in, china, the, idea, of, the, peasant, remains, powerfully, entrenched, in, the, western, perception, of, china, to, this, very, day, modern, western, writers, often, continue, to, use, the, term, peasant, for, chinese, farmers, typically, without, ever, defining, what, the, term, means, this, western, use, of, the, term, suggests, that, china, is, stagnant, medieval, underdeveloped, and, held, back, by, its, rural, population, cohen, writes, that, the, imposition, of, the, historically, burdened, western, contrasts, of, town, and, country, shopkeeper, and, peasant, or, merchant, and, landlord, serves, only, to, distort, the, realities, of, the, chinese, economic, tradition, in, latin, america, the, term, peasant, is, translated, to, campesino, from, campo, country, person, but, the, meaning, has, changed, over, time, while, most, campesinos, before, the, 20th, century, were, in, equivalent, status, to, peasants, they, usually, did, not, own, land, and, had, to, make, payments, to, or, were, in, an, employment, position, towards, a, landlord, the, hacienda, system, most, latin, american, countries, saw, one, or, more, extensive, land, reforms, in, the, 20th, century, the, land, reforms, of, latin, america, were, more, comprehensive, initiatives, that, redistributed, lands, from, large, landholders, to, former, peasants, farm, workers, and, tenant, farmers, hence, many, campesinos, in, latin, america, today, are, closer, smallholders, who, own, their, land, and, do, not, pay, rent, to, a, landlord, rather, than, peasants, who, do, not, own, land, the, catholic, bishops, of, paraguay, have, asserted, that, every, campesino, has, a, natural, right, to, possess, a, reasonable, allotment, of, land, where, he, can, establish, his, home, work, for, subsistence, of, his, family, and, a, secure, life, in, medieval, europe, society, was, theorized, as, being, organized, into, three, estates, those, who, work, those, who, pray, and, those, who, fight, the, annales, school, of, 20th, century, french, historians, emphasized, the, importance, of, peasants, its, leader, fernand, braudel, devoted, the, first, volume, called, the, structures, of, everyday, life, of, his, major, work, civilization, and, capitalism, 15th, 18th, century, to, the, largely, silent, and, invisible, world, that, existed, below, the, market, economy, other, research, in, the, field, of, peasant, studies, was, promoted, by, florian, znaniecki, and, fei, xiaotong, and, in, the, post, 1945, studies, of, the, great, tradition, and, the, little, tradition, in, the, work, of, robert, redfield, in, the, 1960s, anthropologists, and, historians, began, to, rethink, the, role, of, peasant, revolt, in, world, history, and, in, their, own, disciplines, peasant, revolution, was, seen, as, a, third, world, response, to, capitalism, and, imperialism, the, anthropologist, eric, wolf, for, instance, drew, on, the, work, of, earlier, scholars, in, the, marxist, tradition, such, as, daniel, thorner, who, saw, the, rural, population, as, a, key, element, in, the, transition, from, feudalism, to, capitalism, wolf, and, a, group, of, scholars, criticized, both, marx, and, the, field, of, modernization, theorists, for, treating, peasants, as, lacking, the, ability, to, take, action, james, c, scott, s, field, observations, in, malaysia, convinced, him, that, villagers, were, active, participants, in, their, local, politics, even, though, they, were, forced, to, use, indirect, methods, many, of, these, activist, scholars, looked, back, to, the, peasant, movement, in, india, and, to, the, theories, of, the, revolution, in, china, led, by, mao, zedong, starting, in, the, 1920s, the, anthropologist, myron, cohen, however, asked, why, the, rural, population, in, china, were, called, peasants, rather, than, farmers, a, distinction, he, called, political, rather, than, scientific, one, important, outlet, for, their, scholarly, work, and, theory, was, the, journal, of, peasant, studies
