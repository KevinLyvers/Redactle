creativity, is, the, ability, to, form, novel, and, valuable, ideas, or, works, using, the, imagination, products, of, creativity, may, be, intangible, e, g, an, idea, a, scientific, theory, a, literary, work, a, musical, composition, or, a, joke, or, a, physical, object, e, g, an, invention, a, dish, or, meal, an, item, of, jewelry, a, costume, or, a, painting, creativity, may, also, describe, the, ability, to, find, new, solutions, to, problems, or, new, methods, of, performing, a, task, or, reaching, a, goal, creativity, therefore, enables, people, to, solve, problems, in, new, or, innovative, ways, most, ancient, cultures, including, ancient, greece, ancient, china, and, ancient, india, lacked, the, concept, of, creativity, seeing, art, as, a, form, of, discovery, rather, than, a, form, of, creation, in, the, judeo, christian, tradition, creativity, was, seen, as, the, sole, province, of, god, and, human, creativity, was, considered, an, expression, of, god, s, work, the, modern, conception, of, creativity, came, about, during, the, renaissance, influenced, by, humanist, ideas, scholarly, interest, in, creativity, is, found, in, a, number, of, disciplines, primarily, psychology, business, studies, and, cognitive, science, however, it, is, also, present, in, education, the, humanities, including, philosophy, and, the, arts, theology, and, the, social, sciences, such, as, sociology, linguistics, and, economics, as, well, as, engineering, technology, and, mathematics, subjects, of, study, include, the, relationships, between, creativity, and, general, intelligence, personality, neural, processes, and, mental, health, the, potential, for, fostering, creativity, through, education, training, and, organizational, practices, the, factors, that, determine, how, creativity, is, evaluated, and, perceived, and, the, fostering, of, creativity, for, national, economic, benefit, according, to, harvard, business, school, creativity, benefits, business, by, encouraging, innovation, boosting, productivity, enabling, adaptability, and, fostering, growth, the, english, word, creativity, comes, from, the, latin, terms, creare, meaning, to, create, and, facere, meaning, to, make, its, derivational, suffixes, also, comes, from, latin, the, word, create, appeared, in, english, as, early, as, the, 14th, century, notably, in, chaucer, s, the, parson, s, tale, to, indicate, divine, creation, the, modern, meaning, of, creativity, in, reference, to, human, creation, did, not, emerge, until, after, the, enlightenment, in, a, summary, of, scientific, research, into, creativity, michael, mumford, suggests, we, seem, to, have, reached, a, general, agreement, that, creativity, involves, the, production, of, novel, useful, products, in, robert, sternberg, s, words, creativity, produces, something, original, and, worthwhile, authors, have, diverged, dramatically, in, their, precise, definitions, beyond, these, general, commonalities, peter, meusburger, estimates, that, over, a, hundred, different, definitions, can, be, found, in, the, literature, typically, elaborating, on, the, context, field, organization, environment, etc, that, determines, the, originality, and, or, appropriateness, of, the, created, object, and, the, processes, through, which, it, came, about, as, an, illustration, one, definition, given, by, dr, e, paul, torrance, in, the, context, of, assessing, an, individual, s, creative, ability, is, a, process, of, becoming, sensitive, to, problems, deficiencies, gaps, in, knowledge, missing, elements, disharmonies, and, so, on, identifying, the, difficulty, searching, for, solutions, making, guesses, or, formulating, hypotheses, about, the, deficiencies, testing, and, retesting, these, hypotheses, and, possibly, modifying, and, retesting, them, and, finally, communicating, the, results, ignacio, l, g, tz, following, the, etymology, of, the, word, argues, that, creativity, is, not, necessarily, making, he, confines, it, to, the, act, of, creating, without, thinking, about, the, end, product, while, many, definitions, of, creativity, seem, almost, synonymous, with, originality, he, also, emphasized, the, difference, between, creativity, and, originality, g, tz, asserted, that, one, can, be, creative, without, necessarily, being, original, when, someone, creates, something, they, are, certainly, creative, at, that, point, but, they, may, not, be, original, in, the, case, that, their, creation, is, not, something, new, however, originality, and, creativity, can, go, hand, in, hand, creativity, in, general, is, usually, distinguished, from, innovation, in, particular, where, the, stress, is, on, implementation, for, example, teresa, amabile, and, pratt, define, creativity, as, the, production, of, novel, and, useful, ideas, and, innovation, as, the, implementation, of, creative, ideas, while, the, oecd, and, eurostat, state, that, innovation, is, more, than, a, new, idea, or, an, invention, an, innovation, requires, implementation, either, by, being, put, into, active, use, or, by, being, made, available, for, use, by, other, parties, firms, individuals, or, organizations, there, is, also, emotional, creativity, which, is, described, as, a, pattern, of, cognitive, abilities, and, personality, traits, related, to, originality, and, appropriateness, in, emotional, experience, most, ancient, cultures, including, ancient, greece, ancient, china, and, ancient, india, lacked, the, concept, of, creativity, seeing, art, as, a, form, of, discovery, and, not, creation, the, ancient, greeks, had, no, terms, corresponding, to, to, create, or, creator, except, for, the, expression, poiein, to, make, which, only, applied, to, poiesis, poetry, and, to, the, poietes, poet, or, maker, who, made, it, plato, did, not, believe, in, art, as, a, form, of, creation, asked, in, the, republic, will, we, say, of, a, painter, that, he, makes, something, he, answers, certainly, not, he, merely, imitates, it, is, commonly, argued, that, the, notion, of, creativity, originated, in, western, cultures, through, christianity, as, a, matter, of, divine, inspiration, according, to, scholars, the, earliest, western, conception, of, creativity, was, the, biblical, story, of, the, creation, given, in, genesis, 18, however, this, is, not, creativity, in, the, modern, sense, which, did, not, arise, until, the, renaissance, in, the, judeo, christian, tradition, creativity, was, the, sole, province, of, god, humans, were, not, considered, to, have, the, ability, to, create, something, new, except, as, an, expression, of, god, s, work, a, concept, similar, to, that, in, christianity, existed, in, greek, culture, for, instance, muses, were, seen, as, mediating, inspiration, from, the, gods, romans, and, greeks, invoked, the, concept, of, an, external, creative, daemon, greek, or, genius, latin, linked, to, the, sacred, or, the, divine, however, none, of, these, views, are, similar, to, the, modern, concept, of, creativity, and, the, rejection, of, creativity, in, favor, of, discovery, and, the, belief, that, individual, creation, was, a, conduit, of, the, divine, would, dominate, the, west, probably, until, the, renaissance, and, even, later, 18, 19, it, was, during, the, renaissance, that, creativity, was, first, seen, not, as, a, conduit, for, the, divine, but, from, the, abilities, of, great, men, 18, 19, the, development, of, the, modern, concept, of, creativity, began, in, the, renaissance, when, creation, began, to, be, perceived, as, having, originated, from, the, abilities, of, the, individual, and, not, god, this, could, be, attributed, to, the, leading, intellectual, movement, of, the, time, aptly, named, humanism, which, developed, an, intensely, human, centric, outlook, on, the, world, valuing, the, intellect, and, achievement, of, the, individual, from, this, philosophy, arose, the, renaissance, man, or, polymath, an, individual, who, embodies, the, principles, of, humanism, in, their, ceaseless, courtship, with, knowledge, and, creation, one, of, the, most, well, known, and, immensely, accomplished, examples, is, leonardo, da, vinci, however, the, shift, from, divine, inspiration, to, the, abilities, of, the, individual, was, gradual, and, would, not, become, immediately, apparent, until, the, enlightenment, 19, 21, by, the, 18th, century, and, the, age, of, enlightenment, mention, of, creativity, notably, in, aesthetics, linked, with, the, concept, of, imagination, became, more, frequent, in, the, writing, of, thomas, hobbes, imagination, became, a, key, element, of, human, cognition, william, duff, was, one, of, the, first, to, identify, imagination, as, a, quality, of, genius, typifying, the, separation, being, made, between, talent, productive, but, not, new, ground, and, genius, as, an, independent, topic, of, study, creativity, effectively, received, little, attention, until, the, 19th, century, runco, and, albert, argue, that, creativity, as, the, subject, of, proper, study, began, seriously, to, emerge, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, increased, interest, in, individual, differences, inspired, by, the, arrival, of, darwinism, in, particular, they, refer, to, the, work, of, francis, galton, who, through, his, eugenicist, outlook, took, a, keen, interest, in, the, heritability, of, intelligence, with, creativity, taken, as, an, aspect, of, genius, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, leading, mathematicians, and, scientists, such, as, hermann, von, helmholtz, 1896, and, henri, poincar, 1908, began, to, reflect, on, and, publicly, discuss, their, creative, processes, the, insights, of, poincar, and, von, helmholtz, were, built, on, in, early, accounts, of, the, creative, process, by, pioneering, theorists, such, as, graham, wallas, and, max, wertheimer, in, his, work, art, of, thought, published, in, 1926, wallas, presented, one, of, the, first, models, of, the, creative, process, in, the, wallas, stage, model, creative, insights, and, illuminations, may, be, explained, by, a, process, consisting, of, five, stages, wallas, model, is, also, often, treated, as, four, stages, with, intimation, seen, as, a, sub, stage, wallas, considered, creativity, to, be, a, legacy, of, the, evolutionary, process, which, allowed, humans, to, quickly, adapt, to, rapidly, changing, environments, simonton, provides, an, updated, perspective, on, this, view, in, his, book, origins, of, genius, darwinian, perspectives, on, creativity, in, 1927, alfred, north, whitehead, gave, the, gifford, lectures, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, later, published, as, process, and, reality, he, is, credited, with, having, coined, the, term, creativity, to, serve, as, the, ultimate, category, of, his, metaphysical, scheme, whitehead, actually, coined, the, term, our, term, still, the, preferred, currency, of, exchange, among, literature, science, and, the, arts, a, term, that, quickly, became, so, popular, so, omnipresent, that, its, invention, within, living, memory, and, by, alfred, north, whitehead, of, all, people, quickly, became, occluded, although, psychometric, studies, of, creativity, had, been, conducted, by, the, london, school, of, psychology, as, early, as, 1927, with, the, work, of, h, l, hargreaves, into, the, faculty, of, imagination, the, formal, psychometric, measurement, of, creativity, from, the, standpoint, of, orthodox, psychological, literature, is, usually, considered, to, have, begun, with, j, p, guilford, s, address, to, the, american, psychological, association, in, 1950, the, address, helped, to, popularize, the, study, of, creativity, and, to, focus, attention, on, scientific, approaches, to, conceptualizing, creativity, statistical, analyzes, led, to, the, recognition, of, creativity, as, measured, as, a, separate, aspect, of, human, cognition, from, iq, type, intelligence, into, which, it, had, previously, been, subsumed, guilford, s, work, suggested, that, above, a, threshold, level, of, iq, the, relationship, between, creativity, and, classically, measured, intelligence, broke, down, creativity, is, viewed, differently, in, different, countries, for, example, cross, cultural, research, centered, in, hong, kong, found, that, westerners, view, creativity, more, in, terms, of, the, individual, attributes, of, a, person, such, as, their, aesthetic, taste, while, chinese, people, view, creativity, more, in, terms, of, the, social, influence, of, creative, people, i, e, what, they, can, contribute, to, society, mpofu, et, al, surveyed, 28, african, languages, and, found, that, 27, had, no, word, which, directly, translated, to, creativity, the, exception, being, arabic, 465, the, linguistic, relativity, hypothesis, i, e, that, language, can, affect, thought, suggests, that, the, lack, of, an, equivalent, word, for, creativity, may, affect, the, views, of, creativity, among, speakers, of, such, languages, however, more, research, would, be, needed, to, establish, this, and, there, is, certainly, no, suggestion, that, this, linguistic, difference, makes, people, any, less, or, more, creative, nevertheless, it, is, true, that, there, has, been, very, little, research, on, creativity, in, africa, 458, and, there, has, also, been, very, little, research, on, creativity, in, latin, america, creativity, has, been, more, thoroughly, researched, in, the, northern, hemisphere, but, here, again, there, are, cultural, differences, even, between, countries, or, groups, of, countries, in, close, proximity, for, example, in, scandinavian, countries, creativity, is, seen, as, an, individual, attitude, which, helps, in, coping, with, life, s, challenges, while, in, germany, creativity, is, seen, more, as, a, process, that, can, be, applied, to, help, solve, problems, james, c, kaufman, and, ronald, a, beghetto, introduced, a, four, c, model, of, creativity, the, four, c, s, are, the, following, this, model, was, intended, to, help, accommodate, models, and, theories, of, creativity, that, stressed, competence, as, an, essential, component, and, the, historical, transformation, of, a, creative, domain, as, the, highest, mark, of, creativity, it, also, the, authors, argued, made, a, useful, framework, for, analyzing, creative, processes, in, individuals, the, contrast, between, the, terms, big, c, and, little, c, has, been, widely, used, kozbelt, beghetto, and, runco, use, a, little, c, big, c, model, to, review, major, theories, of, creativity, margaret, boden, distinguishes, between, h, creativity, historical, and, p, creativity, personal, ken, robinson, and, anna, craft, focused, on, creativity, in, a, general, population, particularly, with, respect, to, education, craft, makes, a, similar, distinction, between, high, and, little, c, creativity, and, cites, robinson, as, referring, to, high, and, democratic, creativity, mihaly, csikszentmihalyi, defined, creativity, in, terms, of, individuals, judged, to, have, made, significant, creative, perhaps, domain, changing, contributions, simonton, analyzed, the, career, trajectories, of, eminent, creative, people, in, order, to, map, patterns, and, predictors, of, creative, productivity, theories, of, creativity, and, empirical, investigations, of, why, some, people, are, more, creative, than, others, have, focused, on, a, variety, of, aspects, the, dominant, factors, are, usually, identified, as, the, four, p, s, a, framework, first, put, forward, by, mel, rhodes, in, 2013, based, on, a, sociocultural, critique, of, the, four, p, model, as, individualistic, static, and, decontextualized, vlad, petre, gl, veanu, proposed, a, five, a, s, model, consisting, of, actor, action, artifact, audience, and, affordance, in, this, model, the, actor, is, the, person, with, attributes, but, also, located, within, social, networks, action, is, the, process, of, creativity, not, only, in, internal, cognitive, terms, but, also, external, bridging, the, gap, between, ideation, and, implementation, artifacts, emphasize, how, creative, products, typically, represent, cumulative, innovations, over, time, rather, than, abrupt, discontinuities, and, press, place, is, divided, into, audience, and, affordance, which, consider, the, interdependence, of, the, creative, individual, with, the, social, and, material, world, respectively, although, not, supplanting, the, four, ps, model, in, creativity, research, the, five, as, model, has, exerted, influence, over, the, direction, of, some, creativity, research, and, has, been, credited, with, bringing, coherence, to, studies, across, a, number, of, creative, domains, there, has, been, much, empirical, study, in, psychology, and, cognitive, science, of, the, processes, through, which, creativity, occurs, interpretation, of, the, results, of, these, studies, has, led, to, several, possible, explanations, of, the, sources, and, methods, of, creativity, incubation, is, a, temporary, break, from, creative, problem, solving, that, can, result, in, insight, empirical, research, has, investigated, whether, as, the, concept, of, incubation, in, wallas, s, model, implies, a, period, of, interruption, or, rest, from, a, problem, may, aid, creative, problem, solving, early, work, proposed, that, creative, solutions, to, problems, arise, mysteriously, from, the, unconscious, mind, while, the, conscious, mind, is, occupied, on, other, tasks, this, hypothesis, is, discussed, in, csikszentmihalyi, s, five, phase, model, of, the, creative, process, which, describes, incubation, as, a, time, when, your, unconscious, takes, over, this, was, supposed, to, allow, for, unique, connections, to, be, made, without, our, consciousness, trying, to, make, logical, order, out, of, the, problem, ward, lists, various, hypotheses, that, have, been, advanced, to, explain, why, incubation, may, aid, creative, problem, solving, and, notes, how, some, empirical, evidence, is, consistent, with, a, different, hypothesis, incubation, aids, creative, problems, in, that, it, enables, forgetting, of, misleading, clues, the, absence, of, incubation, may, lead, the, problem, solver, to, become, fixated, on, inappropriate, strategies, of, solving, the, problem, j, p, guilford, drew, a, distinction, between, convergent, and, divergent, production, commonly, renamed, convergent, and, divergent, thinking, convergent, thinking, involves, aiming, for, a, single, correct, or, best, solution, to, a, problem, e, g, how, can, we, get, a, crewed, rocket, to, land, on, the, moon, safely, and, within, budget, divergent, thinking, on, the, other, hand, involves, the, creative, generation, of, multiple, answers, to, an, open, ended, prompt, e, g, how, can, a, chair, be, used, divergent, thinking, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, creativity, in, psychology, literature, or, is, considered, the, necessary, precursor, to, creativity, however, as, runco, points, out, there, is, a, clear, distinction, between, creative, thinking, and, divergent, thinking, creative, thinking, focuses, on, the, production, combination, and, assessment, of, ideas, to, formulate, something, new, and, unique, while, divergent, thinking, focuses, on, the, act, of, conceiving, of, a, variety, of, ideas, that, are, not, necessarily, new, or, unique, other, researchers, have, occasionally, used, the, terms, flexible, thinking, or, fluid, intelligence, which, are, also, roughly, similar, to, but, not, synonymous, with, creativity, while, convergent, and, divergent, thinking, differ, greatly, in, terms, of, approach, to, problem, solving, it, is, believed, that, both, are, employed, to, some, degree, when, solving, most, real, world, problems, in, 1992, finke, et, al, proposed, the, geneplore, model, in, which, creativity, takes, place, in, two, phases, a, generative, phase, where, an, individual, constructs, mental, representations, called, preinventive, structures, and, an, exploratory, phase, where, those, structures, are, used, to, come, up, with, creative, ideas, some, evidence, shows, that, when, people, use, their, imagination, to, develop, new, ideas, those, ideas, are, structured, in, predictable, ways, by, the, properties, of, existing, categories, and, concepts, weisberg, argued, by, contrast, that, creativity, involves, ordinary, cognitive, processes, yielding, extraordinary, results, helie, and, sun, proposed, a, framework, for, understanding, creativity, in, problem, solving, namely, the, explicit, implicit, interaction, eii, theory, of, creativity, this, theory, attempts, to, provide, a, more, unified, explanation, of, relevant, phenomena, in, part, by, reinterpreting, integrating, various, fragmentary, existing, theories, of, incubation, and, insight, the, eii, theory, relies, mainly, on, five, basic, principles, a, computational, implementation, of, the, theory, was, developed, based, on, the, clarion, cognitive, architecture, and, used, to, simulate, relevant, human, data, this, work, is, an, initial, step, in, the, development, of, process, based, theories, of, creativity, encompassing, incubation, insight, and, various, other, related, phenomena, in, the, act, of, creation, arthur, koestler, introduced, the, concept, of, bisociation, that, creativity, arises, as, a, result, of, the, intersection, of, two, quite, different, frames, of, reference, in, the, 1990s, various, approaches, in, cognitive, science, that, dealt, with, metaphor, analogy, and, structure, mapping, converged, and, a, new, integrative, approach, to, the, study, of, creativity, in, science, art, and, humor, emerged, under, the, label, conceptual, blending, honing, theory, developed, principally, by, psychologist, liane, gabora, posits, that, creativity, arises, due, to, the, self, organizing, self, mending, nature, of, a, worldview, the, creative, process, is, a, way, in, which, the, individual, hones, and, re, hones, an, integrated, worldview, honing, theory, places, emphasis, not, only, on, the, externally, visible, creative, outcome, but, also, on, the, internal, cognitive, restructuring, and, repair, of, the, worldview, brought, about, by, the, creative, process, and, production, when, one, is, faced, with, a, creatively, demanding, task, there, is, an, interaction, between, one, s, conception, of, the, task, and, one, s, worldview, the, conception, of, the, task, changes, through, interaction, with, the, worldview, and, the, worldview, changes, through, interaction, with, the, task, this, interaction, is, reiterated, until, the, task, is, complete, at, which, point, the, task, is, conceived, of, differently, and, the, worldview, is, subtly, or, drastically, transformed, following, the, natural, tendency, of, a, worldview, to, attempt, to, resolve, dissonance, and, seek, internal, consistency, amongst, its, components, whether, they, be, ideas, attitudes, or, bits, of, knowledge, dissonance, in, a, person, s, worldview, is, in, some, cases, generated, by, viewing, their, peers, creative, outputs, and, so, people, pursue, their, own, creative, endeavors, to, restructure, their, worldviews, and, reduce, dissonance, this, shift, in, worldview, and, cognitive, restructuring, through, creative, acts, has, also, been, considered, as, a, way, to, explain, possible, benefits, of, creativity, on, mental, health, the, theory, also, addresses, challenges, not, addressed, by, other, theories, of, creativity, such, as, the, factors, guiding, restructuring, and, the, evolution, of, creative, works, a, central, feature, of, honing, theory, is, the, notion, of, a, potential, state, honing, theory, posits, that, creative, thought, proceeds, not, by, searching, through, and, randomly, mutating, predefined, possibilities, but, by, drawing, upon, associations, that, exist, due, to, overlap, in, the, distributed, neural, cell, assemblies, that, participate, in, the, encoding, of, experiences, in, memory, midway, through, the, creative, process, one, may, have, made, associations, between, the, current, task, and, previous, experiences, but, not, yet, disambiguated, which, aspects, of, those, previous, experiences, are, relevant, to, the, current, task, thus, the, creative, idea, may, feel, half, baked, at, that, point, it, can, be, said, to, be, in, a, potentiality, state, because, how, it, will, actualize, depends, on, the, different, internally, or, externally, generated, contexts, it, interacts, with, honing, theory, is, held, to, explain, certain, phenomena, not, dealt, with, by, other, theories, of, creativity, for, example, how, different, works, by, the, same, creator, exhibit, a, recognizable, style, or, voice, even, in, different, creative, outlets, this, is, not, predicted, by, theories, of, creativity, that, emphasize, chance, processes, or, the, accumulation, of, expertise, but, it, is, predicted, by, honing, theory, according, to, which, personal, style, reflects, the, creator, s, uniquely, structured, worldview, another, example, is, the, environmental, stimulus, for, creativity, creativity, is, commonly, considered, to, be, fostered, by, a, supportive, nurturing, and, trustworthy, environment, conducive, to, self, actualization, in, line, with, this, idea, gabora, posits, that, creativity, is, a, product, of, culture, and, that, our, social, interactions, evolve, our, culture, in, way, that, promotes, creativity, in, everyday, thought, people, often, spontaneously, imagine, alternatives, to, reality, when, they, think, if, only, their, counterfactual, thinking, is, viewed, as, an, example, of, everyday, creative, processes, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, creation, of, counterfactual, alternatives, to, reality, depends, on, similar, cognitive, processes, to, rational, thought, imaginative, thought, in, everyday, life, can, be, categorized, based, on, whether, it, involves, perceptual, motor, related, mental, imagery, novel, combinatorial, processing, or, altered, psychological, states, this, classification, aids, in, understanding, the, neural, foundations, and, practical, implications, of, imagination, creative, thinking, is, a, central, aspect, of, everyday, life, encompassing, both, controlled, and, undirected, processes, this, includes, divergent, thinking, and, stage, models, highlighting, the, importance, of, extra, and, meta, cognitive, contributions, to, imaginative, thought, brain, network, dynamics, play, a, crucial, role, in, creative, cognition, the, default, and, executive, control, networks, in, the, brain, cooperate, during, creative, tasks, suggesting, a, complex, interaction, between, these, networks, in, facilitating, everyday, imaginative, thought, the, term, dialectical, theory, of, creativity, dates, back, to, psychoanalyst, daniel, dervin, and, was, later, developed, into, an, interdisciplinary, theory, the, dialectical, theory, of, creativity, starts, with, the, ancient, concept, that, creativity, takes, place, in, an, interplay, between, order, and, chaos, similar, ideas, can, be, found, in, neuroscience, and, psychology, neurobiologically, it, can, be, shown, that, the, creative, process, takes, place, in, a, dynamic, interplay, between, coherence, and, incoherence, that, leads, to, new, and, usable, neuronal, networks, psychology, shows, how, the, dialectics, of, convergent, and, focused, thinking, with, divergent, and, associative, thinking, leads, to, new, ideas, and, products, personality, traits, like, the, big, five, seem, to, be, dialectically, intertwined, in, the, creative, process, emotional, instability, vs, stability, extraversion, vs, introversion, openness, vs, reserve, agreeableness, vs, antagonism, and, disinhibition, vs, constraint, the, dialectical, theory, of, creativity, applies, also, to, counseling, and, psychotherapy, lin, and, vartanian, developed, a, neurobiological, description, of, creative, cognition, this, interdisciplinary, framework, integrates, theoretical, principles, and, empirical, results, from, neuroeconomics, reinforcement, learning, cognitive, neuroscience, and, neurotransmission, research, on, the, locus, coeruleus, system, it, describes, how, decision, making, processes, studied, by, neuroeconomists, as, well, as, activity, in, the, locus, coeruleus, system, underlie, creative, cognition, and, the, large, scale, brain, network, dynamics, associated, with, creativity, it, suggests, that, creativity, is, an, optimization, and, utility, maximization, problem, that, requires, individuals, to, determine, the, optimal, way, to, exploit, and, explore, ideas, the, multi, armed, bandit, problem, this, utility, maximization, process, is, thought, to, be, mediated, by, the, locus, coeruleus, system, and, this, creativity, framework, describes, how, tonic, and, phasic, locus, coeruleus, activity, work, in, conjunction, to, facilitate, the, exploiting, and, exploring, of, creative, ideas, this, framework, not, only, explains, previous, empirical, results, but, also, makes, novel, and, falsifiable, predictions, at, different, levels, of, analysis, ranging, from, neurobiological, to, cognitive, and, personality, differences, b, f, skinner, attributed, creativity, to, accidental, behaviors, that, are, reinforced, by, the, environment, in, behaviorism, creativity, can, be, understood, as, novel, or, unusual, behaviors, that, are, reinforced, if, they, produce, a, desired, outcome, spontaneous, behaviors, by, living, creatures, are, thought, to, reflect, past, learned, behaviors, in, this, way, a, behaviorist, may, say, that, prior, learning, caused, novel, behaviors, to, be, reinforced, many, times, over, and, the, individual, has, been, shaped, to, produce, increasingly, novel, behaviors, a, creative, person, according, to, this, definition, is, someone, who, has, been, reinforced, more, often, for, novel, behaviors, than, others, behaviorists, suggest, that, anyone, can, be, creative, they, just, need, to, be, reinforced, to, learn, to, produce, novel, behaviors, another, theory, about, creative, people, is, the, investment, theory, of, creativity, this, approach, suggests, that, many, individual, and, environmental, factors, must, exist, in, precise, ways, for, extremely, high, levels, of, creativity, opposed, to, average, levels, of, creativity, to, result, in, the, investment, sense, a, person, with, their, particular, characteristics, in, their, particular, environment, may, see, an, opportunity, to, devote, their, time, and, energy, into, something, that, has, been, overlooked, by, others, the, creative, person, develops, an, undervalued, or, under, recognized, idea, to, the, point, that, it, is, established, as, a, new, and, creative, idea, just, like, in, the, financial, world, some, investments, are, worth, the, buy, in, while, others, are, less, productive, and, do, not, build, to, the, extent, that, the, investor, expected, this, investment, theory, of, creativity, asserts, that, creativity, might, rely, to, some, extent, on, the, right, investment, of, effort, being, added, to, a, field, at, the, right, time, in, the, right, way, j, rgen, schmidhuber, s, formal, theory, of, creativity, postulates, that, creativity, curiosity, and, interestingness, are, by, products, of, a, simple, computational, principle, for, measuring, and, optimizing, learning, progress, consider, an, agent, able, to, manipulate, its, environment, and, thus, its, own, sensory, inputs, the, agent, can, use, a, black, box, optimization, method, such, as, reinforcement, learning, to, learn, through, informed, trial, and, error, sequences, of, actions, that, maximize, the, expected, sum, of, its, future, reward, signals, there, are, extrinsic, reward, signals, for, achieving, externally, given, goals, such, as, finding, food, when, hungry, but, schmidhuber, s, objective, function, to, be, maximized, also, includes, an, additional, intrinsic, term, to, model, wow, effects, this, non, standard, term, motivates, purely, creative, behavior, of, the, agent, even, when, there, are, no, external, goals, a, wow, effect, is, formally, defined, as, follows, as, the, agent, is, creating, and, predicting, and, encoding, the, continually, growing, history, of, actions, and, sensory, inputs, it, keeps, improving, the, predictor, or, encoder, which, can, be, implemented, as, an, artificial, neural, network, or, some, other, machine, learning, device, that, can, exploit, regularities, in, the, data, to, improve, its, performance, over, time, the, improvements, can, be, measured, precisely, by, computing, the, difference, in, computational, costs, storage, size, number, of, required, synapses, errors, time, needed, to, encode, new, observations, before, and, after, learning, this, difference, depends, on, the, encoder, s, present, subjective, knowledge, which, changes, over, time, but, the, theory, formally, takes, this, into, account, the, cost, difference, measures, the, strength, of, the, present, wow, effect, due, to, sudden, improvements, in, data, compression, or, computational, speed, it, becomes, an, intrinsic, reward, signal, for, the, action, selector, the, objective, function, thus, motivates, the, action, optimizer, to, create, action, sequences, causing, more, wow, effects, irregular, random, data, or, noise, do, not, permit, any, wow, effects, or, learning, progress, and, thus, are, boring, by, nature, providing, no, reward, already, known, and, predictable, regularities, also, are, boring, temporarily, interesting, are, only, the, initially, unknown, novel, regular, patterns, in, both, actions, and, observations, this, motivates, the, agent, to, perform, continual, open, ended, active, creative, exploration, schmidhuber, s, work, is, highly, influential, in, intrinsic, motivation, which, has, emerged, as, a, research, topic, as, part, of, the, study, of, artificial, intelligence, and, robotics, according, to, schmidhuber, his, objective, function, explains, the, activities, of, scientists, artists, and, comedians, for, example, physicists, are, motivated, to, create, experiments, leading, to, observations, that, obey, previously, unpublished, physical, laws, permitting, better, data, compression, likewise, composers, receive, intrinsic, reward, for, creating, non, arbitrary, melodies, with, unexpected, but, regular, harmonies, that, permit, wow, effects, through, data, compression, improvements, similarly, a, comedian, gets, intrinsic, reward, for, inventing, a, novel, joke, with, an, unexpected, punch, line, related, to, the, beginning, of, the, story, in, an, initially, unexpected, but, quickly, learnable, way, that, also, allows, for, better, compression, of, the, perceived, data, schmidhuber, augured, that, computer, hardware, advances, would, greatly, scale, up, rudimentary, artificial, scientists, and, artists, he, used, the, theory, to, create, low, complexity, art, and, an, attractive, human, face, j, p, guilford, s, group, which, pioneered, the, modern, psychometric, study, of, creativity, constructed, several, performance, based, tests, to, measure, creativity, in, 1967, including, asking, participants, to, write, original, titles, for, a, story, with, a, given, plot, asking, participants, to, come, up, with, unusual, uses, for, everyday, objects, like, bricks, and, asking, participants, to, generate, a, list, of, consequences, of, unexpected, events, like, the, loss, of, gravity, guilford, was, trying, to, create, a, model, for, intellect, as, a, whole, but, in, doing, so, he, also, created, a, model, for, creativity, guilford, made, an, important, assumption, which, was, needed, for, creativity, research, that, creativity, was, not, an, abstract, concept, the, idea, that, creativity, was, a, category, rather, than, a, single, concept, enabled, other, researchers, to, look, at, creativity, with, a, new, perspective, additionally, guilford, hypothesized, one, of, the, first, models, for, the, components, of, creativity, he, explained, that, creativity, was, a, result, of, having, three, qualities, the, ability, to, recognize, problems, fluency, and, flexibility, fluency, encompassed, ideational, fluency, or, the, ability, to, rapidly, produce, a, variety, of, ideas, fulfilling, stated, requirements, associational, fluency, or, the, ability, to, generate, a, list, of, words, associated, with, a, given, word, and, expressional, fluency, or, the, ability, to, organize, words, into, larger, units, like, phrases, sentences, and, paragraphs, flexibility, encompassed, both, spontaneous, flexibility, or, the, general, ability, to, be, flexible, and, adaptive, flexibility, or, the, ability, to, produces, responses, that, are, novel, and, high, in, quality, this, represents, the, base, model, which, several, researchers, would, alter, to, produce, their, new, theories, of, creativity, years, later, building, on, guilford, s, work, tests, were, developed, sometimes, called, divergent, thinking, dt, tests, which, have, been, both, supported, and, criticized, one, example, is, the, torrance, tests, of, creative, thinking, developed, in, 1966, they, involved, tasks, of, divergent, thinking, and, other, problem, solving, skills, which, were, scored, on, four, categories, fluency, the, total, number, of, meaningful, and, relevant, ideas, generated, flexibility, the, number, of, different, categories, of, responses, originality, the, statistical, rarity, of, the, responses, and, elaboration, the, amount, of, detail, given, considerable, progress, has, been, made, in, the, automated, scoring, of, divergent, thinking, tests, using, a, semantic, approach, when, compared, to, human, raters, nlp, techniques, are, reliable, and, valid, for, scoring, originality, computer, programs, were, able, to, achieve, a, correlation, to, human, graders, of, 0, 60, and, 0, 72, semantic, networks, also, devise, originality, scores, that, yield, significant, correlations, with, socio, personal, measures, a, team, of, researchers, led, by, james, c, kaufman, and, mark, a, runco, combined, expertise, in, creativity, research, natural, language, processing, computational, linguistics, and, statistical, data, analysis, to, devise, a, scalable, system, for, computerized, automated, testing, the, sparcit, creativity, index, testing, system, this, system, enabled, automated, scoring, of, dt, tests, that, is, reliable, objective, and, scalable, thus, addressing, most, of, the, issues, of, dt, tests, that, had, been, found, and, reported, the, resultant, computer, system, was, able, to, achieve, a, correlation, to, human, graders, of, 0, 73, researchers, have, taken, a, social, personality, approach, by, using, personality, traits, such, as, independence, of, judgement, self, confidence, attraction, to, complexity, aesthetic, orientation, and, risk, taking, as, measures, of, personal, creativity, within, the, framework, of, the, big, five, personality, traits, a, consistent, few, of, these, traits, have, emerged, as, being, correlated, to, creativity, openness, to, experience, is, consistently, related, to, a, host, of, different, assessments, of, creativity, on, the, other, big, five, traits, research, has, demonstrated, subtle, differences, between, different, domains, of, creativity, compared, to, non, artists, artists, tend, to, have, higher, levels, of, openness, to, experience, and, lower, levels, of, conscientiousness, while, scientists, are, more, open, to, experience, conscientious, and, higher, in, the, confidence, dominance, facets, of, extraversion, compared, to, non, scientists, biographical, methods, use, quantitative, characteristics, such, as, the, number, of, publications, patents, or, performances, of, a, work, can, be, credited, to, a, person, while, this, method, was, originally, developed, for, highly, creative, personalities, today, it, is, also, available, as, self, report, questionnaires, supplemented, with, frequent, less, outstanding, creative, behaviors, such, as, writing, a, short, story, or, creating, your, own, recipes, the, self, report, questionnaire, most, frequently, used, in, research, is, the, creative, achievement, questionnaire, a, self, report, test, that, measures, creative, achievement, across, ten, domains, which, described, in, 2005, and, shown, to, be, reliable, when, compared, to, other, measures, of, creativity, and, to, independent, evaluation, of, creative, output, the, potential, relationship, between, creativity, and, intelligence, has, been, of, interest, since, the, last, half, of, the, twentieth, century, when, many, influential, studies, focused, not, only, on, creativity, but, also, on, intelligence, this, joint, focus, highlights, both, the, theoretical, and, practical, importance, of, the, relationship, researchers, are, interested, not, only, if, the, constructs, are, related, but, also, how, and, why, there, are, multiple, theories, accounting, for, their, relationship, with, the, three, main, theories, threshold, theory, states, that, intelligence, is, a, necessary, but, not, sufficient, condition, for, creativity, and, that, there, is, a, moderate, positive, relationship, between, creativity, and, intelligence, until, iq, 120, certification, theory, states, that, creativity, is, not, intrinsically, related, to, intelligence, instead, individuals, are, required, to, meet, the, requisite, level, of, intelligence, in, order, to, gain, a, certain, level, of, education, or, work, which, then, in, turn, offers, the, opportunity, to, be, creative, in, this, theory, displays, of, creativity, are, moderated, by, intelligence, interference, theory, states, in, contrast, that, extremely, high, intelligence, might, interfere, with, creative, ability, sternberg, and, o, hara, proposed, a, different, framework, of, five, possible, relationships, between, creativity, and, intelligence, that, creativity, was, a, subset, of, intelligence, that, intelligence, was, a, subset, of, creativity, that, the, two, constructs, overlapped, that, they, were, both, part, of, the, same, construct, coincident, sets, or, that, they, were, distinct, constructs, disjoint, sets, a, number, of, researchers, include, creativity, either, explicitly, or, implicitly, as, a, key, component, of, intelligence, for, example, in, this, relationship, model, intelligence, is, a, key, component, in, the, development, of, creativity, for, example, this, possible, relationship, concerns, creativity, and, intelligence, as, distinct, but, intersecting, constructs, for, example, under, this, view, researchers, posit, that, there, are, no, differences, in, the, mechanisms, underlying, creativity, between, those, used, in, normal, problem, solving, and, in, normal, problem, solving, there, is, no, need, for, creativity, thus, creativity, and, intelligence, problem, solving, are, the, same, thing, perkins, referred, to, this, as, the, nothing, special, view, in, this, view, creativity, and, intelligence, are, completely, different, unrelated, constructs, some, theories, suggest, that, creativity, may, be, particularly, susceptible, to, affective, influence, the, term, affect, in, this, context, refers, to, liking, or, disliking, key, aspects, of, the, subject, in, question, this, work, largely, follows, from, findings, in, psychology, regarding, the, ways, in, which, affective, states, are, involved, in, human, judgment, and, decision, making, according, to, alice, isen, positive, affect, has, three, primary, effects, on, cognitive, activity, first, it, makes, additional, cognitive, material, available, for, processing, increasing, the, number, of, cognitive, elements, available, for, association, second, it, leads, to, defocused, attention, and, a, more, complex, cognitive, context, increasing, the, breadth, of, those, elements, that, are, treated, as, relevant, to, the, problem, third, it, increases, cognitive, flexibility, increasing, the, probability, that, diverse, cognitive, elements, will, in, fact, become, associated, together, these, processes, lead, positive, affect, to, improve, creativity, barbara, fredrickson, in, her, broaden, and, build, model, suggests, that, positive, emotions, such, as, joy, and, love, broaden, a, person, s, available, repertoire, of, cognitions, and, actions, thus, enhancing, creativity, according, to, these, researchers, positive, emotions, increase, the, number, of, cognitive, elements, available, for, association, attention, scope, and, the, number, of, elements, that, are, relevant, to, the, problem, cognitive, scope, day, by, day, psychological, experiences, including, emotions, perceptions, and, motivation, significantly, impact, creative, performance, creativity, is, higher, when, emotions, and, perceptions, are, more, positive, and, when, intrinsic, motivation, is, stronger, some, meta, analyses, such, as, baas, et, al, 2008, of, 66, studies, about, creativity, and, affect, support, the, link, between, creativity, and, positive, affect, links, have, been, identified, between, creativity, and, mood, disorders, particularly, manic, depressive, disorder, a, k, a, bipolar, disorder, and, depressive, disorder, a, k, a, unipolar, disorder, however, different, artists, have, described, mental, illness, as, having, both, positive, and, negative, effects, on, their, work, in, general, people, who, have, worked, in, the, arts, industry, throughout, history, have, faced, many, environmental, factors, that, are, associated, with, and, can, sometimes, influence, mental, illness, things, such, as, poverty, persecution, social, alienation, psychological, trauma, substance, abuse, and, high, stress, a, study, by, psychologist, j, philippe, rushton, found, creativity, to, correlate, with, intelligence, and, psychoticism, another, study, found, creativity, to, be, greater, in, people, with, schizotypal, personality, disorder, than, in, people, with, either, schizophrenia, or, those, without, mental, health, conditions, while, divergent, thinking, was, associated, with, activation, of, both, sides, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, schizotypal, individuals, were, found, to, have, much, greater, activation, of, their, right, prefrontal, cortex, specifically, that, study, hypothesized, that, such, individuals, are, better, at, accessing, both, hemispheres, allowing, them, to, make, novel, associations, at, a, faster, rate, consistent, with, this, hypothesis, ambidexterity, is, also, more, common, in, people, with, schizotypal, personality, disorder, and, schizophrenia, three, studies, by, mark, batey, and, adrian, furnham, demonstrated, the, relationships, between, schizotypal, personality, disorder, and, hypomanic, personality, and, several, different, measures, of, creativity, a, study, of, 300, 000, persons, with, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, or, unipolar, depression, and, their, relatives, found, overrepresentation, in, creative, professions, for, those, with, bipolar, disorder, as, well, as, for, undiagnosed, siblings, of, those, with, schizophrenia, or, bipolar, disorder, there, was, no, overall, overrepresentation, but, overrepresentation, for, artistic, occupations, among, those, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, there, was, no, association, for, those, with, unipolar, depression, or, their, relatives, another, study, involving, more, than, one, million, people, conducted, by, swedish, researchers, at, the, karolinska, institute, reported, a, number, of, correlations, between, creative, occupations, and, mental, illnesses, writers, had, a, higher, risk, of, anxiety, and, bipolar, disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar, depression, and, substance, abuse, and, were, almost, twice, as, likely, as, the, general, population, to, kill, themselves, dancers, and, photographers, were, also, more, likely, to, have, bipolar, disorder, those, in, the, creative, professions, were, no, more, likely, to, have, psychiatric, disorders, than, other, people, although, they, were, more, likely, to, have, a, close, relative, with, a, disorder, including, anorexia, and, to, some, extent, autism, the, journal, of, psychiatric, research, reported, nancy, andreasen, was, one, of, the, first, researchers, to, carry, out, a, large, scale, study, on, creativity, and, whether, mental, illnesses, have, an, impact, on, someone, s, ability, to, be, creative, she, expected, to, find, a, link, between, creativity, and, schizophrenia, but, her, research, sample, the, book, authors, she, pooled, had, no, history, of, schizophrenia, her, findings, instead, showed, that, 80, of, the, creative, group, previously, had, some, form, of, mental, illness, episode, in, their, lifetime, when, she, performed, follow, up, studies, over, a, 15, year, period, she, found, that, 43, of, the, authors, had, bipolar, disorder, compared, to, the, 1, of, the, general, public, in, 1989, another, study, by, kay, redfield, jamison, reaffirmed, those, statistics, by, having, 38, of, her, sample, of, authors, having, a, history, of, mood, disorders, anthony, storr, a, prominent, psychiatrist, remarked, the, creative, process, can, be, a, way, of, protecting, the, individual, against, being, overwhelmed, by, depression, a, means, of, regaining, a, sense, of, mastery, in, those, who, have, lost, it, and, to, a, varying, extent, a, way, of, repairing, the, self, damaged, by, bereavement, or, by, the, loss, of, confidence, in, human, relationships, which, accompanies, depression, from, whatever, cause, people, diagnosed, with, bipolar, disorder, report, themselves, as, having, a, larger, range, of, emotional, understanding, heightened, states, of, perception, and, an, ability, to, connect, better, with, those, in, the, world, around, them, other, reported, traits, include, higher, rates, of, productivity, higher, senses, of, self, awareness, and, a, greater, understanding, of, empathy, those, who, have, bipolar, disorder, also, understand, their, own, sense, of, heightened, creativity, and, ability, to, get, immense, amounts, of, tasks, done, all, at, once, in, one, study, of, 219, participants, aged, 19, to, 63, diagnosed, with, bipolar, disorder, 82, of, them, reported, having, elevated, feelings, of, creativity, during, the, hypomanic, swings, a, study, done, by, shapiro, and, weisberg, also, showed, a, positive, correlation, between, the, manic, upswings, of, the, cycles, of, bipolar, disorder, and, the, ability, for, an, individual, to, be, more, creative, the, data, showed, however, that, it, was, not, the, depressive, swing, that, brings, forth, dark, creative, spurts, but, the, act, of, climbing, out, of, the, depressive, episode, that, sparks, creativity, the, reason, behind, this, spur, of, creative, genius, could, come, from, the, type, of, self, image, that, the, person, has, during, a, time, of, hypomania, a, hypomanic, person, may, feel, a, bolstered, sense, of, self, confidence, creative, confidence, and, sense, of, individualism, giannouli, believes, that, the, creativity, a, person, diagnosed, with, bipolar, disorder, feels, comes, as, a, form, of, stress, management, in, the, realm, of, music, one, might, be, expressing, one, s, stress, or, pains, through, the, pieces, one, writes, in, order, to, better, understand, those, same, feelings, famous, authors, and, musicians, along, with, some, actors, would, often, attribute, their, wild, enthusiasm, to, something, like, a, hypomanic, state, the, artistic, side, of, society, has, been, notorious, for, behaviors, that, are, seen, as, maladapted, to, societal, norms, symptoms, of, bipolar, disorder, match, up, with, behaviors, in, high, profile, creative, personalities, such, as, alcohol, addiction, drug, abuse, including, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and, dissociatives, opioids, inhalants, and, cannabis, difficulties, in, holding, regular, occupations, interpersonal, problems, legal, issues, and, a, high, risk, of, suicide, weisberg, believes, that, the, state, of, mania, sets, free, the, powers, of, a, thinker, he, implies, that, not, only, has, the, person, become, more, creative, but, they, have, fundamentally, changed, the, kind, of, thoughts, they, produce, in, a, study, of, poets, who, seem, to, have, especially, high, percentages, of, bipolar, authors, over, a, period, of, three, years, those, poets, would, have, cycles, of, really, creative, and, powerful, works, of, poetry, the, timelines, over, the, three, year, study, looked, at, the, poets, personal, journals, and, their, clinical, records, and, found, that, the, timelines, between, their, most, powerful, poems, matched, that, of, their, upswings, in, bipolar, disorder, creativity, can, be, expressed, in, a, number, of, different, forms, depending, on, unique, people, and, environments, theorists, have, suggested, a, number, of, different, models, of, the, creative, person, however, the, creativity, profiling, approach, must, take, into, account, the, tension, between, predicting, the, creative, profile, of, an, individual, as, characterized, by, the, psychometric, approach, and, the, evidence, that, team, creativity, is, founded, on, diversity, and, difference, from, a, personality, traits, perspective, there, are, a, number, of, traits, that, are, associated, with, creativity, in, people, creative, people, tend, to, be, more, open, to, new, experiences, are, more, self, confident, are, more, ambitious, self, accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and, hostile, compared, to, people, with, less, creativity, one, characteristic, of, creative, people, as, measured, by, some, psychologists, is, what, is, called, divergent, production, the, ability, of, a, person, to, generate, a, diverse, assortment, of, yet, an, appropriate, amount, of, responses, to, a, given, situation, one, way, to, measure, divergent, production, is, by, administering, the, torrance, tests, of, creative, thinking, the, torrance, tests, of, creative, thinking, assess, the, diversity, quantity, and, appropriateness, of, participants, responses, to, a, variety, of, open, ended, questions, some, researchers, also, emphasize, how, creative, people, are, better, at, balancing, between, divergent, and, convergent, production, which, depends, on, an, individual, s, innate, preference, or, ability, to, explore, and, exploit, ideas, other, researchers, of, creativity, see, what, distinguishes, creative, people, as, a, cognitive, process, of, dedication, to, problem, solving, and, developing, expertise, in, the, field, of, their, creative, expression, hardworking, people, study, the, work, of, people, before, them, in, their, milieu, become, experts, in, their, fields, and, then, have, the, ability, to, add, to, and, build, upon, previous, information, in, innovative, and, creative, ways, in, a, study, of, projects, by, design, students, students, who, had, more, knowledge, on, their, subject, on, average, had, greater, creativity, within, their, projects, the, aspect, of, motivation, in, a, person, s, personality, may, also, predict, their, creativity, levels, motivation, stems, from, two, different, sources, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, intrinsic, motivation, is, an, internal, drive, within, a, person, to, participate, or, invest, as, a, result, of, personal, interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc, extrinsic, motivation, is, a, drive, from, outside, a, person, and, might, take, the, form, of, payment, rewards, fame, approval, from, others, etc, although, extrinsic, motivation, and, intrinsic, motivation, can, both, increase, creativity, in, certain, cases, strictly, extrinsic, motivation, often, impedes, creativity, in, people, in, studying, exceptionally, creative, people, in, history, some, common, traits, in, lifestyle, and, environment, are, often, found, creative, people, usually, had, supportive, but, rigid, and, non, nurturing, parents, most, had, an, interest, in, their, field, at, an, early, age, and, most, had, a, highly, supportive, and, skilled, mentor, in, their, field, of, interest, often, the, field, they, chose, was, relatively, uncharted, allowing, for, their, creativity, to, be, expressed, more, most, exceptionally, creative, people, devoted, almost, all, of, their, time, and, energy, into, their, craft, and, after, about, a, decade, had, a, creative, breakthrough, of, fame, their, lives, were, marked, with, extreme, dedication, and, a, cycle, of, hard, work, and, breakthroughs, as, a, result, of, their, determination, the, neuroscience, of, creativity, looks, at, the, operation, of, the, brain, during, creative, behavior, one, article, writes, that, creative, innovation, might, require, coactivation, and, communication, between, regions, of, the, brain, that, ordinarily, are, not, strongly, connected, highly, creative, people, who, excel, at, creative, innovation, tend, to, differ, from, others, in, three, ways, first, they, have, a, high, level, of, specialized, knowledge, second, they, are, capable, of, divergent, thinking, mediated, by, the, frontal, lobe, and, third, they, are, able, to, modulate, neurotransmitters, such, as, norepinephrine, in, their, frontal, lobe, thus, the, frontal, lobe, appears, to, be, the, part, of, the, cortex, that, is, most, important, for, creativity, a, 2015, study, on, creativity, found, that, it, involves, the, interaction, of, multiple, neural, networks, including, those, that, support, associative, thinking, along, with, other, default, mode, network, functions, in, 2018, some, experiments, showed, that, when, the, brain, suppresses, obvious, or, known, solutions, the, outcome, is, solutions, that, are, more, creative, this, suppression, is, mediated, by, alpha, oscillations, in, the, right, temporal, lobe, creativity, involves, the, forming, of, associative, elements, into, new, combinations, that, are, useful, or, meet, some, requirement, sleep, aids, this, process, rem, rather, than, nrem, sleep, appears, to, be, responsible, this, may, be, due, to, changes, in, cholinergic, and, noradrenergic, neuromodulation, that, occurs, during, rem, sleep, during, this, period, of, sleep, high, levels, of, acetylcholine, in, the, hippocampus, suppress, feedback, from, the, hippocampus, to, the, neocortex, and, lower, levels, of, acetylcholine, and, norepinephrine, in, the, neocortex, encourage, the, spread, of, associational, activity, within, neocortical, areas, without, control, from, the, hippocampus, this, is, in, contrast, to, waking, consciousness, in, which, higher, levels, of, norepinephrine, and, acetylcholine, inhibit, recurrent, connections, in, the, neocortex, rem, sleep, may, aid, creativity, by, allowing, neocortical, structures, to, reorganize, associative, hierarchies, in, which, information, from, the, hippocampus, would, be, reinterpreted, in, relation, to, previous, semantic, representations, or, nodes, vandervert, described, how, the, brain, s, frontal, lobes, and, the, cognitive, functions, of, the, cerebellum, collaborate, to, produce, creativity, and, innovation, vandervert, s, explanation, rests, on, considerable, evidence, that, all, processes, of, working, memory, responsible, for, processing, all, thought, are, adaptively, modeled, for, increased, efficiency, by, the, cerebellum, the, cerebellum, consisting, of, 100, billion, neurons, which, is, more, than, the, entirety, of, the, rest, of, the, brain, also, adaptively, models, all, bodily, movement, for, efficiency, the, cerebellum, s, adaptive, models, of, working, memory, processing, are, then, fed, back, to, especially, frontal, lobe, working, memory, control, processes, where, creative, and, innovative, thoughts, arise, apparently, creative, insight, or, the, aha, experience, is, then, triggered, in, the, temporal, lobe, according, to, vandervert, the, details, of, creative, adaptation, begin, in, forward, cerebellar, models, which, are, anticipatory, exploratory, controls, for, movement, and, thought, these, cerebellar, processing, and, control, architectures, have, been, termed, hierarchical, modular, selection, and, identification, for, control, hmosaic, new, hierarchically, arranged, levels, of, the, cerebellar, control, architecture, hmosaic, develop, as, mental, mulling, in, working, memory, is, extended, over, time, these, new, levels, of, the, control, architecture, are, fed, forward, to, the, frontal, lobes, since, the, cerebellum, adaptively, models, all, movement, and, all, levels, of, thought, and, emotion, vandervert, s, approach, helps, explain, creativity, and, innovation, in, sports, art, music, the, design, of, video, games, technology, mathematics, the, child, prodigy, and, thought, in, general, vandervert, argues, that, when, a, person, is, confronted, with, a, challenging, new, situation, visual, spatial, working, memory, and, speech, related, working, memory, are, decomposed, and, re, composed, fractionated, by, the, cerebellum, and, then, blended, in, the, cerebral, cortex, in, an, attempt, to, deal, with, the, new, situation, with, repeated, attempts, to, deal, with, challenging, situations, the, cerebro, cerebellar, blending, process, continues, to, optimize, the, efficiency, of, how, working, memory, deals, with, the, situation, or, problem, he, also, argues, that, this, is, the, same, process, only, involving, visual, spatial, working, memory, and, pre, language, vocalization, that, led, to, the, evolution, of, language, in, humans, vandervert, and, vandervert, weathers, have, pointed, out, that, this, blending, process, because, it, continuously, optimizes, efficiencies, constantly, improves, prototyping, attempts, toward, the, invention, or, innovation, of, new, ideas, music, art, or, technology, prototyping, they, argue, not, only, produces, new, products, it, trains, the, cerebro, cerebellar, pathways, involved, to, become, more, efficient, at, prototyping, itself, further, vandervert, and, vandervert, weathers, believe, that, this, repetitive, mental, prototyping, or, mental, rehearsal, involving, the, cerebellum, and, the, cerebral, cortex, explains, the, success, of, the, self, driven, individualized, patterning, of, repetitions, initiated, by, the, teaching, methods, of, the, khan, academy, the, model, proposed, by, vandervert, has, however, received, incisive, critique, from, several, authors, in, 2005, alice, flaherty, presented, a, three, factor, model, of, the, creative, drive, drawing, from, evidence, in, brain, imaging, drug, studies, and, lesion, analysis, she, described, the, creative, drive, as, resulting, from, an, interaction, of, the, frontal, lobes, the, temporal, lobes, and, dopamine, from, the, limbic, system, the, frontal, lobes, may, be, responsible, for, idea, generation, and, the, temporal, lobes, for, idea, editing, and, evaluation, abnormalities, in, the, frontal, lobe, such, as, depression, or, anxiety, generally, decrease, creativity, while, abnormalities, in, the, temporal, lobe, often, increase, creativity, high, activity, in, the, temporal, lobe, typically, inhibits, activity, in, the, frontal, lobe, and, vice, versa, high, dopamine, levels, increase, general, arousal, and, goal, directed, behaviors, and, reduce, latent, inhibition, and, all, three, effects, increase, the, drive, to, generate, ideas, in, 2018, lin, and, vartanian, proposed, a, neuroeconomic, framework, that, precisely, describes, norepinephrine, s, role, in, creativity, and, modulating, large, scale, brain, networks, associated, with, creativity, this, framework, describes, how, neural, activity, in, different, brain, regions, and, networks, like, the, default, mode, network, track, utility, or, subjective, value, of, ideas, economic, approaches, to, creativity, have, focused, on, three, aspects, the, impact, of, creativity, on, economic, growth, methods, of, modeling, markets, for, creativity, and, the, maximization, of, economic, creativity, innovation, in, the, early, 20th, century, joseph, schumpeter, introduced, the, economic, theory, of, creative, destruction, to, describe, the, way, in, which, old, ways, of, doing, things, are, endogenously, destroyed, and, replaced, by, the, new, some, economists, such, as, paul, romer, view, creativity, as, an, important, element, in, the, recombination, of, elements, to, produce, new, technologies, and, products, and, consequently, economic, growth, creativity, leads, to, capital, and, creative, products, are, protected, by, intellectual, property, laws, mark, a, runco, and, daniel, rubenson, have, tried, to, describe, a, psychoeconomic, model, of, creativity, in, such, a, model, creativity, is, the, product, of, endowments, and, active, investments, in, creativity, the, costs, and, benefits, of, bringing, creative, activity, to, market, determine, the, supply, of, creativity, such, an, approach, has, been, criticized, for, its, view, of, creativity, consumption, as, always, having, positive, utility, and, for, the, way, it, analyzes, the, value, of, future, innovations, in, his, 2002, book, the, rise, of, the, creative, class, economist, richard, florida, popularized, the, notion, that, regions, with, 3, t, s, of, economic, development, technology, talent, and, tolerance, also, have, high, concentrations, of, creative, professionals, and, tend, to, have, a, higher, level, of, economic, development, creativity, research, for, most, of, the, twentieth, century, was, dominated, by, psychology, and, business, studies, with, little, work, done, in, sociology, since, the, turn, of, the, millennium, there, has, been, more, attention, paid, by, sociological, researchers, but, it, has, yet, to, establish, itself, as, a, specific, research, field, with, reviews, of, sociological, research, into, creativity, a, rarity, in, high, impact, literature, while, psychology, has, tended, to, focus, on, the, individual, as, the, locus, of, creativity, sociological, research, is, directed, more, at, the, structures, and, context, within, which, creative, activity, takes, place, primarily, based, in, sociology, of, culture, which, finds, its, roots, in, the, works, of, marx, durkheim, and, weber, this, has, meant, a, focus, on, the, cultural, and, creative, industries, as, sociological, phenomena, such, research, has, covered, a, variety, of, areas, including, the, economics, and, production, of, culture, the, role, of, creative, industries, in, development, and, the, rise, of, the, creative, class, from, an, evolutionary, perspective, creativity, may, be, a, result, of, the, outcome, of, years, of, generating, ideas, as, ideas, are, continuously, generated, the, need, to, evolve, produces, a, need, for, new, ideas, and, developments, as, a, result, people, have, been, creating, and, developing, new, innovative, and, creative, ideas, to, build, our, progress, as, a, society, some, see, the, conventional, system, of, schooling, as, stifling, of, creativity, and, they, attempt, particularly, in, the, preschool, kindergarten, and, early, school, years, to, provide, a, creativity, friendly, rich, imagination, fostering, environment, for, young, children, researchers, have, seen, this, as, important, because, technology, is, advancing, our, society, at, an, unprecedented, rate, and, creative, problem, solving, will, be, needed, to, cope, with, these, challenges, as, they, arise, in, addition, to, helping, with, problem, solving, creativity, also, helps, students, identify, problems, where, others, have, failed, to, do, so, the, waldorf, school, is, an, example, of, an, education, program, that, promotes, creative, thought, promoting, intrinsic, motivation, and, problem, solving, are, two, areas, where, educators, can, foster, creativity, in, students, students, are, more, creative, when, they, see, a, task, as, intrinsically, motivating, valued, for, its, own, sake, to, promote, creative, thinking, educators, need, to, identify, what, motivates, their, students, and, to, structure, teaching, around, it, providing, students, with, a, choice, of, activities, to, complete, allows, them, to, become, more, intrinsically, motivated, and, therefore, creative, in, completing, the, tasks, teaching, students, to, solve, problems, that, do, not, have, well, defined, answers, is, another, way, to, foster, their, creativity, this, is, accomplished, by, allowing, students, to, explore, problems, and, redefine, them, possibly, drawing, on, knowledge, that, at, first, may, seem, unrelated, to, the, problem, in, order, to, solve, it, in, adults, mentoring, individuals, is, another, way, to, foster, their, creativity, however, the, benefits, of, mentoring, creativity, apply, only, to, creative, contributions, considered, great, in, a, given, field, not, to, everyday, creative, expression, musical, creativity, is, a, gateway, to, the, flow, state, which, is, conducive, to, spontaneity, improvisation, and, creativity, studies, show, that, it, is, beneficial, to, emphasize, students, creative, side, and, integrate, more, creativity, into, their, curriculums, with, a, notable, strategy, being, through, music, one, reason, for, this, is, that, students, are, able, to, express, themselves, through, musical, improvisation, in, a, way, that, taps, into, higher, order, brain, regions, while, connecting, with, their, peers, allowing, them, to, go, beyond, typical, pattern, generation, in, this, sense, improvisation, is, a, form, of, self, expression, that, can, generate, connectivity, amongst, peers, and, surpass, the, age, old, rudimentary, aspects, of, school, in, the, scottish, education, system, creativity, is, identified, as, a, core, skillset, for, learning, life, and, work, and, is, defined, as, a, process, which, generates, ideas, that, have, value, to, the, individual, it, involves, looking, at, familiar, things, with, a, fresh, eye, examining, problems, with, an, open, mind, making, connections, learning, from, mistakes, and, using, imagination, to, explore, new, possibilities, the, need, to, develop, a, shared, language, and, understanding, of, creativity, and, its, role, across, every, aspect, of, learning, teaching, and, continuous, improvement, was, identified, as, a, necessary, aim, and, a, set, of, four, skills, is, used, to, allow, educators, to, discuss, and, develop, creativity, skills, across, all, subjects, and, sectors, of, education, curiosity, open, mindedness, imagination, and, problem, solving, distinctions, are, made, between, creative, learning, when, learners, are, using, their, creativity, skills, creative, teaching, when, educators, are, using, their, creativity, skills, and, creative, change, when, creativity, skills, are, applied, to, planning, and, improvement, scotland, s, national, creative, learning, plan, supports, the, development, of, creativity, skills, in, all, learners, and, of, educators, expertise, in, developing, creativity, skills, a, range, of, resources, have, been, created, to, support, and, assess, this, including, a, national, review, of, creativity, across, learning, by, her, majesty, s, inspectorate, for, education, recognizes, that, creativity, ability, is, crucial, for, national, security, social, development, and, improving, people, s, benefits, measures, have, been, proposed, to, enhance, creative, ability, in, the, country, emphasizes, creativity, as, a, transversal, theme, important, for, the, development, of, basic, skills, and, has, declared, 2009, the, year, of, creativity, and, innovation, countries, like, france, germany, italy, and, spain, have, incorporated, creativity, into, their, education, and, economic, policies, various, research, studies, set, out, to, establish, that, organizational, effectiveness, depends, on, the, creativity, of, the, workforce, to, a, large, extent, for, any, given, organization, measures, of, effectiveness, vary, depending, upon, its, mission, environmental, context, nature, of, work, the, product, or, service, it, produces, and, customer, demands, thus, the, first, step, in, evaluating, organizational, effectiveness, is, to, understand, the, organization, itself, how, it, functions, how, it, is, structured, and, what, it, emphasizes, similarly, social, psychologists, organizational, scientists, and, management, scientists, who, research, factors, that, influence, creativity, and, innovation, in, teams, and, organizations, have, developed, integrative, theoretical, models, that, emphasize, the, roles, of, team, composition, team, processes, and, organizational, culture, these, theoretical, models, also, emphasize, the, mutually, reinforcing, relationships, between, them, in, promoting, innovation, research, studies, of, the, knowledge, economy, may, be, classified, into, three, levels, macro, meso, and, micro, macro, studies, are, at, a, societal, or, transnational, dimension, meso, studies, focus, on, organizations, micro, investigations, center, on, the, minutiae, workings, of, workers, there, is, also, an, interdisciplinary, dimension, such, as, research, from, businesses, economics, education, human, resource, management, knowledge, and, organizational, management, sociology, psychology, knowledge, economy, related, sectors, especially, software, and, advertising, diversity, of, team, members, backgrounds, and, knowledge, can, increase, team, creativity, by, expanding, the, collection, of, unique, information, that, is, available, to, the, team, and, by, introducing, different, perspectives, that, can, integrate, in, novel, ways, however, under, some, conditions, diversity, can, also, decrease, team, creativity, by, making, it, more, difficult, for, team, members, to, communicate, about, ideas, and, causing, interpersonal, conflicts, between, those, with, different, perspectives, thus, the, potential, advantages, of, diversity, must, be, supported, by, appropriate, team, processes, and, organizational, cultures, in, order, to, enhance, creativity, team, communication, norms, such, as, respecting, others, expertise, paying, attention, to, others, ideas, expecting, information, sharing, tolerating, disagreements, negotiating, remaining, open, to, others, ideas, learning, from, others, and, building, on, each, other, s, ideas, increase, team, creativity, by, facilitating, the, social, processes, involved, with, brainstorming, and, problem, solving, through, these, processes, team, members, can, access, their, collective, pool, of, knowledge, reach, shared, understandings, identify, new, ways, of, understanding, problems, or, tasks, and, make, new, connections, between, ideas, engaging, in, these, social, processes, also, promotes, positive, team, affect, which, facilitates, collective, creativity, supportive, and, motivational, environments, that, create, psychological, safety, by, encouraging, risk, taking, and, tolerating, mistakes, increase, team, creativity, as, well, organizations, in, which, help, seeking, help, giving, and, collaboration, are, rewarded, promote, innovation, by, providing, opportunities, and, contexts, in, which, team, processes, that, lead, to, collective, creativity, can, occur, additionally, leadership, styles, that, downplay, status, hierarchies, or, power, differences, within, an, organization, and, empower, people, to, speak, up, about, their, ideas, or, opinions, also, help, to, create, cultures, that, are, conducive, to, creativity, there, is, a, long, standing, debate, on, how, material, constraints, e, g, lack, of, money, materials, or, equipment, affect, creativity, in, psychological, and, managerial, research, two, competing, views, in, this, regard, prevail, in, one, view, scholars, propose, a, negative, effect, of, material, constraints, on, innovation, and, claim, that, material, constraints, starve, creativity, proponents, argue, that, adequate, material, resources, are, needed, to, engage, in, creative, activities, like, experimenting, with, new, solutions, and, idea, exploration, in, an, opposing, view, scholars, assert, that, people, tend, to, stick, to, established, routines, or, solutions, as, long, as, they, are, not, forced, to, deviate, from, them, by, constraints, for, example, material, constraints, facilitated, the, development, of, jet, engines, in, world, war, ii, to, reconcile, these, competing, views, contingency, models, were, proposed, the, rationale, behind, these, models, is, that, certain, contingency, factors, e, g, creativity, climate, or, creativity, relevant, skills, influence, the, relationship, between, constraints, and, creativity, these, contingency, factors, reflect, the, need, for, higher, levels, of, motivation, and, skills, when, working, on, creative, tasks, under, constraints, depending, on, these, contingency, factors, there, is, either, a, positive, or, negative, relationship, between, constraints, and, creativity, several, researchers, have, proposed, methods, of, increasing, a, person, s, creativity, such, ideas, range, from, the, psychological, cognitive, such, as, the, osborn, parnes, creative, problem, solving, process, synectics, science, based, creative, thinking, purdue, creative, thinking, program, and, edward, de, bono, s, lateral, thinking, to, the, highly, structured, such, as, triz, the, theory, of, inventive, problem, solving, and, its, variant, algorithm, of, inventive, problem, solving, developed, by, the, russian, scientist, genrich, altshuller, and, computer, aided, morphological, analysis, an, empirical, synthesis, of, which, methods, work, best, in, enhancing, creativity, was, published, by, haase, et, al, summarising, the, results, of, 84, studies, the, authors, found, that, complex, training, courses, meditation, and, cultural, exposure, were, most, effective, in, enhancing, creativity, while, the, use, of, cognitive, manipulation, drugs, was, noneffective, experiments, suggest, the, need, for, closure, of, task, participants, whether, as, a, reflection, of, personality, or, induced, through, time, pressure, negatively, impacts, creativity, accordingly, it, has, been, suggested, that, reading, fiction, which, can, reduce, the, cognitive, need, for, closure, may, help, to, encourage, creativity, so, called, malevolent, creativity, is, the, dark, side, of, creativity, this, type, of, creativity, is, not, typically, accepted, within, society, and, is, defined, by, the, intention, to, cause, harm, to, others, through, original, and, innovative, means, while, it, is, often, associated, with, criminal, behavior, it, can, also, be, observed, in, ordinary, day, to, day, life, as, lying, cheating, and, betrayal, malevolent, creativity, should, be, distinguished, from, negative, creativity, in, that, negative, creativity, may, unintentionally, cause, harm, to, others, whereas, malevolent, creativity, is, explicitly, malevolently, motivated, malevolent, creativity, is, a, key, contributor, to, crime, and, in, its, most, destructive, form, can, even, manifest, as, terrorism, as, creativity, requires, deviating, from, the, conventional, there, is, a, permanent, tension, between, being, creative, and, going, too, far, in, some, cases, to, the, point, of, breaking, the, law, aggression, is, a, key, predictor, of, malevolent, creativity, and, increased, levels, of, aggression, correlate, with, a, higher, likelihood, of, committing, crime, although, everyone, shows, some, levels, of, malevolent, creativity, under, certain, conditions, those, that, have, a, higher, propensity, towards, it, have, increased, tendencies, to, deceive, and, manipulate, others, to, their, own, gain, while, malevolent, creativity, appears, to, dramatically, increase, when, an, individual, is, placed, under, unfair, conditions, personality, particularly, aggressiveness, is, also, a, key, predictor, in, anticipating, levels, of, malevolent, thinking, researchers, harris, and, reiter, palmon, investigated, the, role, of, aggression, in, levels, of, malevolent, creativity, in, particular, levels, of, implicit, aggression, and, the, tendency, to, employ, aggressive, actions, in, response, to, problem, solving, the, personality, traits, of, physical, aggression, conscientiousness, emotional, intelligence, and, implicit, aggression, all, seem, to, be, related, with, malevolent, creativity, harris, and, reiter, palmon, s, research, showed, that, when, subjects, were, presented, with, a, problem, that, designed, to, trigger, malevolent, creativity, participants, high, in, implicit, aggression, and, low, in, premeditation, expressed, the, largest, number, of, malevolently, themed, solutions, when, presented, with, the, more, benign, problem, designed, to, trigger, prosocial, motives, of, helping, others, and, cooperating, those, high, in, implicit, aggression, even, if, they, were, high, in, impulsiveness, were, far, less, destructive, in, their, imagined, solutions, the, researchers, concluded, premeditation, more, than, implicit, aggression, controlled, an, individual, s, expression, of, malevolent, creativity, the, current, measure, for, malevolent, creativity, is, the, 13, item, malevolent, creativity, behaviour, scale, mcbs
