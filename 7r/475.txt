the, east, african, coast, and, adjacent, littoral, islands, estimates, of, the, number, of, swahili, speakers, including, both, native, and, second, language, speakers, vary, widely, they, generally, range, from, 60, million, to, 150, million, with, most, of, its, native, speakers, residing, in, tanzania, swahili, has, a, significant, number, of, loanwords, from, other, languages, mainly, arabic, as, well, as, from, portuguese, english, and, german, around, 40, of, swahili, vocabulary, consists, of, arabic, loanwords, including, the, name, of, the, language, saw, il, a, plural, adjectival, form, of, an, arabic, word, meaning, of, the, coasts, the, loanwords, date, from, the, era, of, contact, between, arab, traders, and, the, bantu, inhabitants, of, the, east, coast, of, africa, which, was, also, the, time, period, when, swahili, emerged, as, a, lingua, franca, in, the, region, due, to, concerted, efforts, by, the, government, of, tanzania, swahili, is, one, of, three, official, languages, the, others, being, english, and, french, of, the, east, african, community, eac, countries, namely, burundi, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, kenya, rwanda, somalia, south, sudan,

the, african, union, and, of, the, southern, african, development, community, the, east, african, community, created, an, institution, called, the, east, african, kiswahili, commission, eakc, which, began, operations, in, 2015, the, institution, currently, serves, as, the, leading, body, for, promoting, the, language, in, the, east, african, region, as, well, as, for, coordinating, its, development, and, usage, for, regional, integration, and, sustainable, development, in, recent, years, south, africa, botswana, namibia, ethiopia, and, south, sudan, have, begun, offering, swahili, as, a, subject, in, schools, or, have, developed, plans, to, do, so, shikomor, or, comorian, an, official, language, in, comoros, and, also, spoken, in, mayotte, shimaore, is, closely, related, to, swahili, and, is, sometimes, considered, a, dialect, of, swahili, although, other, authorities, consider, it, a, distinct, language, in, 2022, based, on, swahili, s, growth, as, a, prominent, international, language, the, united, nations, declared, swahili, language, day, as, 7, july, to, commemorate, the, date, that, julius, nyerere, adopted, swahili, as, a, unifying, language, for, african, independence, struggles, swahili, is, a, bantu, language, of, the, sabaki, branch, in, guthrie, s, geographic, classification, swahili, is, in, bantu, zone, g, whereas, the, other, sabaki, languages, are, in, zone, e70, commonly, under, the, name, nyika, historical, linguists, consider, the, arabic, influence, on, swahili, to, be, significant, since, it, takes, around, 15, of, its, vocabulary, directly, from, arabic, and, was, initially, spread, by, arab, slave, traders, along, the, east, african, coast, the, word, swahili, comes, from, an, arabic, name, for, the, area, meaning, coasts, the, core, of, the, swahili, language, originates, in, bantu, languages, of, the, coast, of, east, africa, much, of, swahili, s, bantu, vocabulary, has, cognates, in, the, unguja, pemba, and, mijikenda, languages, and, to, a, lesser, extent, other, east, african, bantu, languages, while, opinions, vary, on, the, specifics, it, has, been, historically, purported, that, around, 16, 20, of, the, swahili, vocabulary, is, derived, from, loan, words, the, vast, majority, arabic, but, also, other, contributing, languages, including, persian, hindustani, portuguese, and, malay, omani, arabic, is, the, source, of, most, arabic, loanwords, in, swahili, in, the, text, early, swahili, history, reconsidered, however, thomas, spear, noted, that, swahili, retains, a, large, amount, of, grammar, vocabulary, and, sounds, inherited, from, the, sabaki, language, in, fact, while, taking, account, of, daily, vocabulary, using, lists, of, one, hundred, words, 72, 91, were, inherited, from, the, sabaki, language, which, is, reported, as, a, parent, language, whereas, 4, 17, were, loan, words, from, other, african, languages, only, 2, 8, were, from, non, african, languages, and, arabic, loan, words, constituted, a, fraction, of, that, according, to, other, sources, around, 40, of, the, swahili, vocabulary, comes, from, arabic, what, also, remained, unconsidered, was, that, a, good, number, of, the, borrowed, terms, had, bantu, equivalents, the, preferred, use, of, arabic, loan, words, is, prevalent, along, the, coast, where, local, people, in, a, cultural, show, of, proximity, to, or, descent, from, arab, culture, would, rather, use, loan, words, whereas, the, people, in, the, interior, tend, to, use, the, bantu, equivalents, it, was, originally, written, in, arabic, script, the, earliest, known, documents, written, in, swahili, are, letters, written, in, kilwa, tanzania, in, 1711, in, the, arabic, script, that, were, sent, to, the, portuguese, of, mozambique, and, their, local, allies, the, original, letters, are, preserved, in, the, historical, archives, of, goa, india, various, colonial, powers, that, ruled, on, the, coast, of, east, africa, played, a, role, in, the, growth, and, spread, of, swahili, with, the, arrival, of, the, arabs, in, east, africa, they, used, swahili, as, a, language, of, trade, as, well, as, for, teaching, islam, to, the, local, bantu, peoples, this, resulted, in, swahili, first, being, written, in, the, arabic, script, the, later, contact, with, the, portuguese, resulted, in, the, increase, of, vocabulary, of, the, swahili, language, the, language, was, formalised, in, an, institutional, level, when, the, germans, took, over, after, the, berlin, conference, after, seeing, there, was, already, a, widespread, language, the, germans, formalised, it, as, the, official, language, to, be, used, in, schools, thus, schools, in, swahili, are, called, shule, from, german, schule, in, government, trade, and, the, court, system, with, the, germans, controlling, the, major, swahili, speaking, region, in, east, africa, they, changed, the, alphabet, system, from, arabic, to, latin, after, the, first, world, war, britain, took, over, german, east, africa, where, they, found, swahili, rooted, in, most, areas, not, just, the, coastal, regions, the, british, decided, to, formalise, it, as, the, language, to, be, used, across, the, east, african, region, although, in, british, east, africa, most, areas, used, english, and, various, nilotic, and, other, bantu, languages, while, swahili, was, mostly, restricted, to, the, coast, in, june, 1928, an, inter, territorial, conference, attended, by, representatives, of, kenya, tanganyika, uganda, and, zanzibar, took, place, in, mombasa, the, zanzibar, dialect, was, chosen, as, standard, swahili, for, those, areas, and, the, standard, orthography, for, swahili, was, adopted, estimates, of, the, total, number, of, first, and, second, language, swahili, speakers, vary, widely, from, as, low, as, 50, million, to, as, high, as, 200, million, but, generally, range, from, 60, million, to, 150, million, swahili, has, become, a, second, language, spoken, by, tens, of, millions, of, people, in, the, five, african, great, lakes, countries, kenya, drc, rwanda, uganda, and, tanzania, where, it, is, an, official, or, national, language, it, is, also, the, first, language, for, many, people, in, tanzania, especially, in, the, coastal, regions, of, tanga, pwani, dar, es, salaam, mtwara, and, lindi, in, the, inner, regions, of, tanzania, swahili, is, spoken, with, an, accent, influenced, by, other, local, languages, and, dialects, there, it, is, a, first, language, for, most, of, the, people, who, are, born, in, the, cities, whilst, being, spoken, as, a, second, language, in, rural, areas, swahili, and, closely, related, languages, are, spoken, by, relatively, small, numbers, of, people, in, burundi, comoros, malawi, mozambique, zambia, and, rwanda, the, language, was, still, understood, in, the, southern, ports, of, the, red, sea, in, the, 20th, century, the, east, african, community, created, an, institution, called, the, east, african, kiswahili, commission, eakc, which, began, operations, in, 2015, the, institution, currently, serves, as, the, leading, body, for, promoting, the, language, in, the, east, african, region, as, well,

software, an, analysed, swahili, text, corpus, of, 25, million, words, an, electronic, dictionary, and, machine, translation, between, swahili, and, english, the, development, of, language, technology, also, strengthens, the, position, of, swahili, as, a, modern, medium, of, communication, furthermore, swahili, wikipedia, is, one, of, the, few, wikipedias, in, an, african, language, that, features, a, substantial, number, of, contributors, and, articles, the, widespread, use, of, swahili, as, a, national, language, in, tanzania, came, after, tanganyika, gained, independence, in, 1961, and, the, government, decided, that, it, would, be, used, as, a, language, to, unify, the, new, nation, this, saw, the, use, of, swahili, in, all, levels, of, government, trade, art, as, well, as, schools, in, which, primary, school, children, are, taught, in, swahili, before, switching, to, english, medium, of, instruction, in, secondary, schools, although, swahili, is, still, taught, as, an, independent, subject, after, tanganyika, and, zanzibar, unification, in, 1964, taasisi, ya, uchunguzi, wa, kiswahili, tuki, institute, of, swahili, research, was, created, from, the, interterritorial, language, committee, in, 1970, tuki, was, merged, with, the, university, of, dar, es, salaam, while, baraza, la, kiswahili, la, taifa, bakita, was, formed, bakita, is, an,

with, swahili, standardising, the, language, bakita, vision, are, 1, to, efficiently, manage, and, coordinate, the, development, and, use, of, kiswahili, in, tanzania, 2, to, participate, fully, and, effectively, in, promoting, swahili, in, east, africa, africa, and, the, entire, world, over, although, other, bodies, and, agencies, can, propose, new, vocabularies, bakita, is, the, only, organisation, that, can, approve, its, usage, in, the, swahili, language, tanzanians, are, highly, credited, for, shaping, the, language, to, appear, the, way, it, is, now, in, kenya, kiswahili, has, been, the, national, language, since, 1964, and, is, official, since, 2010, chama, cha, kiswahili, cha, taifa, chakita, was, established, in, 1998, to, research, and, promote, kiswahili, language, in,

is, widely, spoken, in, the, eastern, regions, the, local, dialects, of, swahili, in, congo, are, known, as, congo, swahili, and, differ, considerably, from, standard, swahili, in, order, to, strengthen, political, ties, with, other, east, african, community, nations, both, kiswahili, and, english, have, been, taught, in, burundian, elementary, schools, since, the, academic, year, 2005, 2006, kiswahili, is, now, used, widely, in, burundi, but, is, not, recognised, as, an, official, language, only, french, kirundi, and, english, have, this, distinction, uganda, adopted, kiswahili, as, one, of, its, official, languages, alongside, english, in, 2022, and, also, made, it, compulsory, across, primary, and, secondary, schools, in, the, country, the, swahili, language, is, not, widespread, in, somalia, and, has, no, official, status, nationally, or, regionally, dialects, of, swahili, are, spoken, by, some, ethnic, minorities, on, the, bajuni, islands, in, the, form, of, kibajuni, on, the, southern, tip, of, the, country, and, in, the, town, of, brava, in, the, form, of, chimwiini, both, contain, a, significant, amount, of, somali, and, italian, loanwords, standard, swahili, is, generally, only, spoken, by, somali, nationals, who, have, resided, in, kenya, and, subsequently, returned, to, somalia, lastly, a, closely, related, language, mushunguli, also, known, as, zigula, zigua, or, chizigua, is, spoken, by, some, of, the, somali, bantu, ethnic, minority, mostly, living, in, the, jubba, valley, it, is, classified, as, a, northeast, coast, bantu, language, as, swahili, is, and, has, some, intelligibility, with, swahili, swahili, played, a, major, role, in, spreading, both, christianity, and, islam, in, east, africa, from, their, arrival, in, east, africa, arabs, brought, islam, and, set, up, madrasas, where, they, used, swahili, to, teach, islam, to, the, natives, as, the, arab, presence, grew, more, and, more, natives, converted, to, islam, and, were, taught, using, the, swahili, language, from, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, east, africa, christianity, was, introduced, to, the, region, while, the, arabs, were, mostly, based, in, the, coastal, areas, european, missionaries, went, further, inland, spreading, christianity, as, the, first, missionary, posts, in, east, africa, were, in, the, coastal, areas, missionaries, picked, up, swahili, and, used, it, to, spread, christianity, since, it, contained, many, similarities, with, other, indigenous, languages, in, the, region, during, the, struggle, for, tanganyika, independence, the, tanganyika, african, national, union, used, swahili, as, a, language, of, mass, organisation, and, political, movement, this, included, publishing, pamphlets, and, radio, broadcasts, to, rally, the, people, to, fight, for, independence, after, gaining, independence, swahili, was, adopted, as, the, national, language, to, this, day, tanzanians, carry, a, sense, of, pride, when, it, comes, to, swahili, especially, when, it, is, used, to, unite, over, 120, tribes, across, tanzania, swahili, was, used, to, strengthen, solidarity, within, the, nation, and, remains, to, be, a, key, identity, of, the, tanzanian, people, standard, swahili, has, five, vowel, phonemes, i, and, u, according, to, ellen, contini, morava, vowels, are, never, reduced, regardless, of, stress, however, according, to, edgar, polom, these, five, phonemes, can, vary, in, pronunciation, polom, claims, that, i, and, u, are, pronounced, as, such, only, in, stressed, syllables, in, unstressed, syllables, as, well, as, before, a, prenasalized, consonant, they, are, pronounced, as, and, e, is, also, commonly, pronounced, as, mid, position, after, w, polom, claims, that, is, pronounced, as, such, only, after, w, and, is, pronounced, as, in, other, situations, especially, after, j, y, a, can, be, pronounced, as, in, word, final, position, long, vowels, in, swahili, are, written, as, doubled, vowels, for, example, kondoo, sheep, due, to, a, historical, process, in, which, l, became, elided, between, the, second, last, and, last, vowels, of, a, word, for, example, kondoo, sheep, was, originally, kondolo, which, survives, in, certain, dialects, as, a, consequence, long, vowels, are, not, considered, phonemic, a, similar, process, exists, in, zulu, where, not, shown, the, orthography, is, the, same, as, ipa, some, dialects, of, swahili, may, also, have, the, aspirated, phonemes, p, t, t, k, b, d, d, though, they, are, unmarked, in, swahili, s, orthography, multiple, studies, favour, classifying, prenasalization, as, consonant, clusters, not, as, separate, phonemes, historically, nasalization, has, been, lost, before, voiceless, consonants, and, subsequently, the, voiced, consonants, have, devoiced, though, they, are, still, written, mb, nd, etc, the, r, phoneme, is, realised, as, either, a, short, trill, or, more, commonly, as, a, single, tap, by, most, speakers, exists, in, free, variation, with, h, and, is, only, distinguished, by, some, speakers, in, some, arabic, loans, nouns, verbs, adjectives, emphasis, or, intensity, is, expressed, by, reproducing, the, original, emphatic, consonants, d, s, t, and, the, uvular, q, or, lengthening, a, vowel, where, aspiration, would, be, used, in, inherited, bantu, words, swahili, is, now, written, in, the, latin, alphabet, there, are, a, few, digraphs, for, native, sounds, ch, sh, ng, and, ny, q, and, x, are, not, used, c, is, not, used, apart, from, the, digraph, ch, unassimilated, english, loans, and, occasionally, as, a, substitute, for, k, in, advertisements, there, are, also, several, digraphs, for, arabic, sounds, which, many, speakers, outside, of, ethnic, swahili, areas, have, trouble, differentiating, the, language, used, to, be, primarily, written, in, the, ajami, script, which, is, an, arabic, script, much, literature, was, produced, in, this, script, with, the, introduction, of, latin, the, use, of, ajami, script, has, been, diminished, significantly, however, the, language, continues, to, have, a, tradition, of, being, written, in, arabic, script, starting, from, the, later, half, of, the, 19th, century, continuing, into, the, 20th, century, and, going, on, in, the, 21st, century, a, process, of, swahilization, of, the, arabic, script, has, been, underway, by, swahili, scribes, and, scholars, the, first, of, such, attempts, was, done, by, mwalimu, sikujua, a, scholar, and, poet, from, mombasa, however, the, spread, of, a, standardized, indigenous, variation, of, arabic, script, for, swahili, was, hampered, by, the, colonial, takeover, of, east, africa, by, the, united, kingdom, and, germany, the, usage, of, arabic, script, was, suppressed, in, german, east, africa, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, british, east, africa, nevertheless, well, into, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, rural, literacy, rate, in, arabic, script, as, well, as, a, local, preference, to, write, swahili, in, the, arabic, script, an, unmodified, version, as, opposed, to, proposals, such, as, that, of, mwalimu, sikujua, was, relatively, high, there, were, also, differences, in, orthographic, conventions, between, cities, and, authors, and, over, the, centuries, some, quite, precise, but, others, different, enough, to, cause, difficulties, with, intelligibility, thus, despite, a, lack, of, official, governmental, backing, attempts, at, standardization, and, swahilization, of, the, arabic, script, continued, into, the, 20th, century, swahili, nouns, are, separable, into, classes, which, are, roughly, analogous, to, genders, in, other, languages, in, swahili, prefixes, mark, groups, of, similar, objects, m, marks, single, human, beings, mtoto, child, wa, marks, multiple, humans, watoto, children, u, marks, abstract, nouns, utoto, childhood, and, so, on, and, just, as, adjectives, and, pronouns, must, agree, with, the, gender, of, nouns, in, some, languages, with, grammatical, gender, so, in, swahili, adjectives, pronouns, and, even, verbs, must, agree, with, nouns, this, is, a, characteristic, feature, of, all, the, bantu, languages, the, ki, vi, class, historically, consisted, of, two, separate, genders, artefacts, bantu, class, 7, 8, utensils, and, hand, tools, mostly, and, diminutives, bantu, class, 12, 13, which, were, conflated, at, a, stage, ancestral, to, swahili, examples, of, the, former, are, kisu, knife, kiti, chair, from, mti, tree, wood, chombo, vessel, a, contraction, of, ki, ombo, examples, of, the, latter, are, kitoto, infant, from, mtoto, child, kitawi, frond, from, tawi, branch, and, chumba, ki, umba, room, from, nyumba, house, it, is, the, diminutive, sense, that, has, been, furthest, extended, an, extension, common, to, diminutives, in, many, languages, is, approximation, and, resemblance, having, a, little, bit, of, some, characteristic, like, y, or, ish, in, english, for, example, there, is, kijani, green, from, jani, leaf, compare, english, leafy, kichaka, bush, from, chaka, clump, and, kivuli, shadow, from, uvuli, shade, a, little, bit, of, a, verb, would, be, an, instance, of, an, action, and, such, instantiations, usually, not, very, active, ones, are, found, kifo, death, from, the, verb, fa, to, die, kiota, nest, from, ota, to, brood, chakula, food, from, kula, to, eat, kivuko, a, ford, a, pass, from, vuka, to, cross, and, kilimia, the, pleiades, from, limia, to, farm, with, from, its, role, in, guiding, planting, a, resemblance, or, being, a, bit, like, something, implies, marginal, status, in, a, category, so, things, that, are, marginal, examples, of, their, class, may, take, the, ki, vi, prefixes, one, example, is, chura, ki, ura, frog, which, is, only, half, terrestrial, and, therefore, is, marginal, as, an, animal, this, extension, may, account, for, disabilities, as, well, kilema, a, cripple, kipofu, a, blind, person, kiziwi, a, deaf, person, finally, diminutives, often, denote, contempt, and, contempt, is, sometimes, expressed, against, things, that, are, dangerous, this, might, be, the, historical, explanation, for, kifaru, rhinoceros, kingugwa, spotted, hyena, and, kiboko, hippopotamus, perhaps, originally, meaning, stubby, legs, another, class, with, broad, semantic, extension, is, the, m, mi, class, bantu, classes, 3, 4, this, is, often, called, the, tree, class, because, mti, miti, tree, s, is, the, prototypical, example, however, it, seems, to, cover, vital, entities, neither, human, nor, typical, animals, trees, and, other, plants, such, as, mwitu, forest, and, mtama, millet, and, from, there, things, made, from, plants, like, mkeka, mat, supernatural, and, natural, forces, such, as, mwezi, moon, mlima, mountain, mto, river, active, things, such, as, moto, fire, including, active, body, parts, moyo, heart, mkono, hand, arm, and, human, groups, which, are, vital, but, not, themselves, human, such, as, mji, village, and, by, analogy, mzinga, beehive, cannon, from, the, central, idea, of, tree, which, is, thin, tall, and, spreading, comes, an, extension, to, other, long, or, extended, things, or, parts, of, things, such, as, mwavuli, umbrella, moshi, smoke, msumari, nail, and, from, activity, there, even, come, active, instantiations, of, verbs, such, as, mfuo, metal, forging, from, fua, to, forge, or, mlio, a, sound, from, lia, to, make, a, sound, words, may, be, connected, to, their, class, by, more, than, one, metaphor, for, example, mkono, is, an, active, body, part, and, mto, is, an, active, natural, force, but, they, are, also, both, long, and, thin, things, with, a, trajectory, such, as, mpaka, border, and, mwendo, journey, are, classified, with, long, thin, things, as, in, many, other, languages, with, noun, classes, this, may, be, further, extended, to, anything, dealing, with, time, such, as, mwaka, year, and, perhaps, mshahara, wages, animals, exceptional, in, some, way, and, so, not, easily, fitting, in, the, other, classes, may, be, placed, in, this, class, the, other, classes, have, foundations, that, may, at, first, seem, similarly, counterintuitive, in, short, borrowings, may, or, may, not, be, given, a, prefix, corresponding, to, the, semantic, class, they, fall, in, for, example, arabic, d, d, bug, insect, was, borrowed, as, mdudu, plural, wadudu, with, the, class, 1, 2, prefixes, m, and, wa, but, arabic, ful, s, fish, scales, plural, of, fals, and, english, sloth, were, borrowed, as, simply, fulusi, mahi, mahi, fish, and, slothi, sloth, with, no, prefix, associated, with, animals, whether, those, of, class, 9, 10, or, 1, 2, in, the, process, of, naturalization, of, borrowings, within, swahili, loanwords, are, often, reinterpreted, or, reanalysed, as, if, they, already, contain, a, swahili, class, prefix, in, such, cases, the, interpreted, prefix, is, changed, with, the, usual, rules, consider, the, following, loanwords, from, arabic, similarly, english, wire, and, arabic, waqt, time, were, interpreted, as, having, the, class, 11, prevocalic, prefix, w, and, became, waya, and, wakati, with, plural, nyaya, and, nyakati, respectively, swahili, phrases,
