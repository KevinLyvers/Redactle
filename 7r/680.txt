communism, from, latin, communis, common, universal, is, a, sociopolitical, philosophical, and, economic, ideology, within, the, socialist, movement, whose, goal, is, the, creation, of, a, communist, society, a, socioeconomic, order, centered, around, common, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, distribution, and, exchange, that, allocates, products, to, everyone, in, the, society, based, on, need, a, communist, society, would, entail, the, absence, of, private, property, and, social, classes, and, ultimately, money, and, the, state, or, nation, state, communists, often, seek, a, voluntary, state, of, self, governance, but, disagree, on, the, means, to, this, end, this, reflects, a, distinction, between, a, more, libertarian, socialist, approach, of, communization, revolutionary, spontaneity, and, workers, self, management, and, a, more, authoritarian, vanguardist, or, communist, party, driven, approach, through, the, development, of, a, socialist, state, followed, by, the, withering, away, of, the, state, as, one, of, the, main, ideologies, on, the, political, spectrum, communist, parties, and, movements, have, been, described, as, radical, left, or, far, left, variants, of, communism, have, been, developed, throughout, history, including, anarchist, communism, marxist, schools, of, thought, and, religious, communism, among, others, communism, encompasses, a, variety, of, schools, of, thought, which, broadly, include, marxism, leninism, and, libertarian, communism, as, well, as, the, political, ideologies, grouped, around, those, all, of, these, different, ideologies, generally, share, the, analysis, that, the, current, order, of, society, stems, from, capitalism, its, economic, system, and, mode, of, production, that, in, this, system, there, are, two, major, social, classes, that, the, relationship, between, these, two, classes, is, exploitative, and, that, this, situation, can, only, ultimately, be, resolved, through, a, social, revolution, the, two, classes, are, the, proletariat, who, make, up, the, majority, of, the, population, within, society, and, must, sell, their, labor, power, to, survive, and, the, bourgeoisie, a, small, minority, that, derives, profit, from, employing, the, working, class, through, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, according, to, this, analysis, a, communist, revolution, would, put, the, working, class, in, power, and, in, turn, establish, common, ownership, of, property, the, primary, element, in, the, transformation, of, society, towards, a, communist, mode, of, production, communism, in, its, modern, form, grew, out, of, the, socialist, movement, in, 18th, century, france, in, the, aftermath, of, the, french, revolution, criticism, of, the, idea, of, private, property, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, of, the, 18th, century, through, such, thinkers, as, gabriel, bonnot, de, mably, jean, meslier, tienne, gabriel, morelly, henri, de, saint, simon, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, in, france, during, the, upheaval, of, the, french, revolution, communism, emerged, as, a, political, doctrine, under, the, auspices, of, fran, ois, no, l, babeuf, nicolas, restif, de, la, bretonne, and, sylvain, mar, chal, all, of, whom, can, be, considered, the, progenitors, of, modern, communism, according, to, james, h, billington, in, the, 20th, century, several, ostensibly, communist, governments, espousing, marxism, leninism, and, its, variants, came, into, power, first, in, the, soviet, union, with, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, and, then, in, portions, of, eastern, europe, asia, and, a, few, other, regions, after, world, war, ii, as, one, of, the, many, types, of, socialism, communism, became, the, dominant, political, tendency, along, with, social, democracy, within, the, international, socialist, movement, by, the, early, 1920s, during, most, of, the, 20th, century, around, one, third, of, the, world, s, population, lived, under, communist, governments, these, governments, were, characterized, by, one, party, rule, by, a, communist, party, the, rejection, of, private, property, and, capitalism, state, control, of, economic, activity, and, mass, media, restrictions, on, freedom, of, religion, and, suppression, of, opposition, and, dissent, with, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, several, previously, communist, governments, repudiated, or, abolished, communist, rule, altogether, afterwards, only, a, small, number, of, nominally, communist, governments, remained, such, as, china, cuba, laos, north, korea, and, vietnam, with, the, exception, of, north, korea, all, of, these, states, have, started, allowing, more, economic, competition, while, maintaining, one, party, rule, the, decline, of, communism, in, the, late, 20th, century, has, been, attributed, to, the, inherent, inefficiencies, of, communist, economies, and, the, general, trend, of, communist, governments, towards, authoritarianism, and, bureaucracy, while, the, emergence, of, the, soviet, union, as, the, world, s, first, nominally, communist, state, led, to, communism, s, widespread, association, with, the, soviet, economic, model, several, scholars, posit, that, in, practice, the, model, functioned, as, a, form, of, state, capitalism, public, memory, of, 20th, century, communist, states, has, been, described, as, a, battleground, between, anti, anti, communism, and, anti, communism, many, authors, have, written, about, mass, killings, under, communist, regimes, and, mortality, rates, such, as, excess, mortality, in, the, soviet, union, under, joseph, stalin, which, remain, controversial, polarized, and, debated, topics, in, academia, historiography, and, politics, when, discussing, communism, and, the, legacy, of, communist, states, communism, derives, from, the, french, word, communisme, a, combination, of, the, latin, rooted, word, communis, which, literally, means, common, and, the, suffix, isme, an, act, practice, or, process, of, doing, something, semantically, communis, can, be, translated, to, of, or, for, the, community, while, isme, is, a, suffix, that, indicates, the, abstraction, into, a, state, condition, action, or, doctrine, communism, may, be, interpreted, as, the, state, of, being, of, or, for, the, community, this, semantic, constitution, has, led, to, numerous, usages, of, the, word, in, its, evolution, prior, to, becoming, associated, with, its, more, modern, conception, of, an, economic, and, political, organization, it, was, initially, used, to, designate, various, social, situations, communism, came, to, be, primarily, associated, with, marxism, most, specifically, embodied, in, the, communist, manifesto, which, proposed, a, particular, type, of, communism, one, of, the, first, uses, of, the, word, in, its, modern, sense, is, in, a, letter, sent, by, victor, d, hupay, to, nicolas, restif, de, la, bretonne, around, 1785, in, which, d, hupay, describes, himself, as, an, auteur, communiste, communist, author, in, 1793, restif, first, used, communisme, to, describe, a, social, order, based, on, egalitarianism, and, the, common, ownership, of, property, restif, would, go, on, to, use, the, term, frequently, in, his, writing, and, was, the, first, to, describe, communism, as, a, form, of, government, john, goodwyn, barmby, is, credited, with, the, first, use, of, communism, in, english, around, 1840, since, the, 1840s, the, term, communism, has, usually, been, distinguished, from, socialism, the, modern, definition, and, usage, of, the, term, socialism, was, settled, by, the, 1860s, becoming, predominant, over, alternative, terms, such, as, associationism, fourierism, mutualism, or, co, operative, which, had, previously, been, used, as, synonyms, meanwhile, the, term, communism, fell, out, of, use, during, this, period, an, early, distinction, between, communism, and, socialism, was, that, the, latter, aimed, to, only, socialize, production, whereas, the, former, aimed, to, socialize, both, production, and, consumption, in, the, form, of, common, access, to, final, goods, this, distinction, can, be, observed, in, marx, s, communism, where, the, distribution, of, products, is, based, on, the, principle, of, to, each, according, to, his, needs, in, contrast, to, a, socialist, principle, of, to, each, according, to, his, contribution, socialism, has, been, described, as, a, philosophy, seeking, distributive, justice, and, communism, as, a, subset, of, socialism, that, prefers, economic, equality, as, its, form, of, distributive, justice, in, 19th, century, europe, the, use, of, the, terms, communism, and, socialism, eventually, accorded, with, the, cultural, attitude, of, adherents, and, opponents, towards, religion, in, european, christendom, communism, was, believed, to, be, the, atheist, way, of, life, in, protestant, england, communism, was, too, phonetically, similar, to, the, roman, catholic, communion, rite, hence, english, atheists, denoted, themselves, socialists, friedrich, engels, stated, that, in, 1848, at, the, time, when, the, communist, manifesto, was, first, published, socialism, was, respectable, on, the, continent, while, communism, was, not, the, owenites, in, england, and, the, fourierists, in, france, were, considered, respectable, socialists, while, working, class, movements, that, proclaimed, the, necessity, of, total, social, change, denoted, themselves, communists, this, latter, branch, of, socialism, produced, the, communist, work, of, tienne, cabet, in, france, and, wilhelm, weitling, in, germany, while, liberal, democrats, looked, to, the, revolutions, of, 1848, as, a, democratic, revolution, which, in, the, long, run, ensured, liberty, equality, and, fraternity, marxists, denounced, 1848, as, a, betrayal, of, working, class, ideals, by, a, bourgeoisie, indifferent, to, the, legitimate, demands, of, the, proletariat, by, 1888, marxists, employed, the, term, socialism, in, place, of, communism, which, had, come, to, be, considered, an, old, fashioned, synonym, for, the, former, it, was, not, until, 1917, with, the, october, revolution, that, socialism, came, to, be, used, to, refer, to, a, distinct, stage, between, capitalism, and, communism, this, intermediate, stage, was, a, concept, introduced, by, vladimir, lenin, as, a, means, to, defend, the, bolshevik, seizure, of, power, against, traditional, marxist, criticism, that, russia, s, productive, forces, were, not, sufficiently, developed, for, socialist, revolution, a, distinction, between, communist, and, socialist, as, descriptors, of, political, ideologies, arose, in, 1918, after, the, russian, social, democratic, labour, party, renamed, itself, as, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, which, resulted, in, the, adjective, communist, being, used, to, refer, to, socialists, who, supported, the, politics, and, theories, of, bolshevism, leninism, and, later, in, the, 1920s, those, of, marxism, leninism, in, spite, of, this, common, usage, communist, parties, also, continued, to, describe, themselves, as, socialists, dedicated, to, socialism, according, to, the, oxford, handbook, of, karl, marx, marx, used, many, terms, to, refer, to, a, post, capitalist, society, positive, humanism, socialism, communism, realm, of, free, individuality, free, association, of, producers, etc, he, used, these, terms, completely, interchangeably, the, notion, that, socialism, and, communism, are, distinct, historical, stages, is, alien, to, his, work, and, only, entered, the, lexicon, of, marxism, after, his, death, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, exactly, how, communism, differs, from, socialism, has, long, been, a, matter, of, debate, but, the, distinction, rests, largely, on, the, communists, adherence, to, the, revolutionary, socialism, of, karl, marx, in, the, united, states, communism, is, widely, used, as, a, pejorative, term, as, part, of, a, red, scare, much, like, socialism, and, mainly, in, reference, to, authoritarian, socialism, and, communist, states, the, emergence, of, the, soviet, union, as, the, world, s, first, nominally, communist, state, led, to, the, term, s, widespread, association, with, marxism, leninism, and, the, soviet, type, economic, planning, model, in, his, essay, judging, nazism, and, communism, martin, malia, defines, a, generic, communism, category, as, any, communist, political, party, movement, led, by, intellectuals, this, umbrella, term, allows, grouping, together, such, different, regimes, as, radical, soviet, industrialism, and, the, khmer, rouge, s, anti, urbanism, according, to, alexander, dallin, the, idea, to, group, together, different, countries, such, as, afghanistan, and, hungary, has, no, adequate, explanation, while, the, term, communist, state, is, used, by, western, historians, political, scientists, and, news, media, to, refer, to, countries, ruled, by, communist, parties, these, socialist, states, themselves, did, not, describe, themselves, as, communist, or, claim, to, have, achieved, communism, they, referred, to, themselves, as, being, a, socialist, state, that, is, in, the, process, of, constructing, communism, terms, used, by, communist, states, include, national, democratic, people, s, democratic, socialist, oriented, and, workers, and, peasants, states, according, to, richard, pipes, the, idea, of, a, classless, egalitarian, society, first, emerged, in, ancient, greece, since, the, 20th, century, ancient, rome, has, been, examined, in, this, context, as, well, as, thinkers, such, as, aristotle, cicero, demosthenes, plato, and, tacitus, plato, in, particular, has, been, considered, as, a, possible, communist, or, socialist, theorist, or, as, the, first, author, to, give, communism, a, serious, consideration, the, 5th, century, mazdak, movement, in, persia, modern, day, iran, has, been, described, as, communistic, for, challenging, the, enormous, privileges, of, the, noble, classes, and, the, clergy, criticizing, the, institution, of, private, property, and, striving, to, create, an, egalitarian, society, at, one, time, or, another, various, small, communist, communities, existed, generally, under, the, inspiration, of, religious, text, in, the, medieval, christian, church, some, monastic, communities, and, religious, orders, shared, their, land, and, their, other, property, sects, deemed, heretical, such, as, the, waldensians, preached, an, early, form, of, christian, communism, as, summarized, by, historians, janzen, rod, and, max, stanton, the, hutterites, believed, in, strict, adherence, to, biblical, principles, church, discipline, and, practised, a, form, of, communism, in, their, words, the, hutterites, established, in, their, communities, a, rigorous, system, of, ordnungen, which, were, codes, of, rules, and, regulations, that, governed, all, aspects, of, life, and, ensured, a, unified, perspective, as, an, economic, system, communism, was, attractive, to, many, of, the, peasants, who, supported, social, revolution, in, sixteenth, century, central, europe, this, link, was, highlighted, in, one, of, karl, marx, s, early, writings, marx, stated, that, s, christ, is, the, intermediary, unto, whom, man, unburdens, all, his, divinity, all, his, religious, bonds, so, the, state, is, the, mediator, unto, which, he, transfers, all, his, godlessness, all, his, human, liberty, thomas, m, ntzer, led, a, large, anabaptist, communist, movement, during, the, german, peasants, war, which, friedrich, engels, analyzed, in, his, 1850, work, the, peasant, war, in, germany, the, marxist, communist, ethos, that, aims, for, unity, reflects, the, christian, universalist, teaching, that, humankind, is, one, and, that, there, is, only, one, god, who, does, not, discriminate, among, people, communist, thought, has, also, been, traced, back, to, the, works, of, the, 16th, century, english, writer, thomas, more, in, his, 1516, treatise, titled, utopia, more, portrayed, a, society, based, on, common, ownership, of, property, whose, rulers, administered, it, through, the, application, of, reason, and, virtue, marxist, communist, theoretician, karl, kautsky, who, popularized, marxist, communism, in, western, europe, more, than, any, other, thinker, apart, from, engels, published, thomas, more, and, his, utopia, a, work, about, more, whose, ideas, could, be, regarded, as, the, foregleam, of, modern, socialism, according, to, kautsky, during, the, october, revolution, in, russia, vladimir, lenin, suggested, that, a, monument, be, dedicated, to, more, alongside, other, important, western, thinkers, in, the, 17th, century, communist, thought, surfaced, again, in, england, where, a, puritan, religious, group, known, as, the, diggers, advocated, the, abolition, of, private, ownership, of, land, in, his, 1895, cromwell, and, communism, eduard, bernstein, stated, that, several, groups, during, the, english, civil, war, especially, the, diggers, espoused, clear, communistic, agrarianist, ideals, and, that, oliver, cromwell, s, attitude, towards, these, groups, was, at, best, ambivalent, and, often, hostile, criticism, of, the, idea, of, private, property, continued, into, the, age, of, enlightenment, of, the, 18th, century, through, such, thinkers, as, gabriel, bonnot, de, mably, jean, meslier, tienne, gabriel, morelly, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, in, france, during, the, upheaval, of, the, french, revolution, communism, emerged, as, a, political, doctrine, under, the, auspices, of, fran, ois, no, l, babeuf, nicolas, restif, de, la, bretonne, and, sylvain, mar, chal, all, of, whom, can, be, considered, the, progenitors, of, modern, communism, according, to, james, h, billington, in, the, early, 19th, century, various, social, reformers, founded, communities, based, on, common, ownership, unlike, many, previous, communist, communities, they, replaced, the, religious, emphasis, with, a, rational, and, philanthropic, basis, notable, among, them, were, robert, owen, who, founded, new, harmony, indiana, in, 1825, and, charles, fourier, whose, followers, organized, other, settlements, in, the, united, states, such, as, brook, farm, in, 1841, in, its, modern, form, communism, grew, out, of, the, socialist, movement, in, 19th, century, europe, as, the, industrial, revolution, advanced, socialist, critics, blamed, capitalism, for, the, misery, of, the, proletariat, a, new, class, of, urban, factory, workers, who, labored, under, often, hazardous, conditions, foremost, among, these, critics, were, marx, and, his, associate, engels, in, 1848, marx, and, engels, offered, a, new, definition, of, communism, and, popularized, the, term, in, their, famous, pamphlet, the, communist, manifesto, in, 1917, the, october, revolution, in, russia, set, the, conditions, for, the, rise, to, state, power, of, vladimir, lenin, s, bolsheviks, which, was, the, first, time, any, avowedly, communist, party, reached, that, position, the, revolution, transferred, power, to, the, all, russian, congress, of, soviets, in, which, the, bolsheviks, had, a, majority, the, event, generated, a, great, deal, of, practical, and, theoretical, debate, within, the, marxist, movement, as, marx, stated, that, socialism, and, communism, would, be, built, upon, foundations, laid, by, the, most, advanced, capitalist, development, however, the, russian, empire, was, one, of, the, poorest, countries, in, europe, with, an, enormous, largely, illiterate, peasantry, and, a, minority, of, industrial, workers, marx, warned, against, attempts, to, transform, my, historical, sketch, of, the, genesis, of, capitalism, in, western, europe, into, a, historico, philosophy, theory, of, the, arche, g, n, rale, imposed, by, fate, upon, every, people, whatever, the, historic, circumstances, in, which, it, finds, itself, and, stated, that, russia, might, be, able, to, skip, the, stage, of, bourgeois, rule, through, the, obshchina, the, moderate, mensheviks, minority, opposed, lenin, s, bolsheviks, majority, plan, for, socialist, revolution, before, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, was, more, fully, developed, the, bolsheviks, successful, rise, to, power, was, based, upon, the, slogans, such, as, peace, bread, and, land, which, tapped, into, the, massive, public, desire, for, an, end, to, russian, involvement, in, world, war, i, the, peasants, demand, for, land, reform, and, popular, support, for, the, soviets, 50, 000, workers, had, passed, a, resolution, in, favour, of, bolshevik, demand, for, transfer, of, power, to, the, soviets, lenin, s, government, also, instituted, a, number, of, progressive, measures, such, as, universal, education, healthcare, and, equal, rights, for, women, the, initial, stage, of, the, october, revolution, which, involved, the, assault, on, petrograd, occurred, largely, without, any, human, casualties, by, november, 1917, the, russian, provisional, government, had, been, widely, discredited, by, its, failure, to, withdraw, from, world, war, i, implement, land, reform, or, convene, the, russian, constituent, assembly, to, draft, a, constitution, leaving, the, soviets, in, de, facto, control, of, the, country, the, bolsheviks, moved, to, hand, power, to, the, second, all, russian, congress, of, soviets, of, workers, and, soldiers, deputies, in, the, october, revolution, after, a, few, weeks, of, deliberation, the, left, socialist, revolutionaries, formed, a, coalition, government, with, the, bolsheviks, from, november, 1917, to, july, 1918, while, the, right, wing, faction, of, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, boycotted, the, soviets, and, denounced, the, october, revolution, as, an, illegal, coup, in, the, 1917, russian, constituent, assembly, election, socialist, parties, totaled, well, over, 70, of, the, vote, the, bolsheviks, were, clear, winners, in, the, urban, centres, and, took, around, two, thirds, of, the, votes, of, soldiers, on, the, western, front, obtaining, 23, 3, of, the, vote, the, socialist, revolutionaries, finished, first, on, the, strength, of, support, from, the, country, s, rural, peasantry, who, were, for, the, most, part, single, issue, voters, that, issue, being, land, reform, obtaining, 37, 6, while, the, ukrainian, socialist, bloc, finished, a, distant, third, at, 12, 7, and, the, mensheviks, obtained, a, disappointing, fourth, place, at, 3, 0, most, of, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, s, seats, went, to, the, right, wing, faction, citing, outdated, voter, rolls, which, did, not, acknowledge, the, party, split, and, the, assembly, s, conflicts, with, the, congress, of, soviets, the, bolshevik, left, socialist, revolutionaries, government, moved, to, dissolve, the, constituent, assembly, in, january, 1918, the, draft, decree, on, the, dissolution, of, the, constituent, assembly, was, issued, by, the, central, executive, committee, of, the, soviet, union, a, committee, dominated, by, lenin, who, had, previously, supported, a, multi, party, system, of, free, elections, after, the, bolshevik, defeat, lenin, started, referring, to, the, assembly, as, a, deceptive, form, of, bourgeois, democratic, parliamentarianism, some, argued, this, was, the, beginning, of, the, development, of, vanguardism, as, an, hierarchical, party, elite, that, controls, society, which, resulted, in, a, split, between, anarchism, and, marxism, and, leninist, communism, assuming, the, dominant, position, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, excluding, rival, socialist, currents, other, communists, and, marxists, especially, social, democrats, who, favored, the, development, of, liberal, democracy, as, a, prerequisite, to, socialism, were, critical, of, the, bolsheviks, from, the, beginning, due, to, russia, being, seen, as, too, backward, for, a, socialist, revolution, council, communism, and, left, communism, inspired, by, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, and, the, wide, proletarian, revolutionary, wave, arose, in, response, to, developments, in, russia, and, are, critical, of, self, declared, constitutionally, socialist, states, some, left, wing, parties, such, as, the, socialist, party, of, great, britain, boasted, of, having, called, the, bolsheviks, and, by, extension, those, communist, states, which, either, followed, or, were, inspired, by, the, soviet, bolshevik, model, of, development, establishing, state, capitalism, in, late, 1917, as, would, be, described, during, the, 20th, century, by, several, academics, economists, and, other, scholars, or, a, command, economy, before, the, soviet, path, of, development, became, known, as, socialism, in, reference, to, the, two, stage, theory, communists, made, no, major, distinction, between, the, socialist, mode, of, production, and, communism, it, is, consistent, with, and, helped, to, inform, early, concepts, of, socialism, in, which, the, law, of, value, no, longer, directs, economic, activity, monetary, relations, in, the, form, of, exchange, value, profit, interest, and, wage, labor, would, not, operate, and, apply, to, marxist, socialism, while, joseph, stalin, stated, that, the, law, of, value, would, still, apply, to, socialism, and, that, the, soviet, union, was, socialist, under, this, new, definition, which, was, followed, by, other, communist, leaders, many, other, communists, maintain, the, original, definition, and, state, that, communist, states, never, established, socialism, in, this, sense, lenin, described, his, policies, as, state, capitalism, but, saw, them, as, necessary, for, the, development, of, socialism, which, left, wing, critics, say, was, never, established, while, some, marxist, leninists, state, that, it, was, established, only, during, the, stalin, era, and, mao, era, and, then, became, capitalist, states, ruled, by, revisionists, others, state, that, maoist, china, was, always, state, capitalist, and, uphold, people, s, socialist, republic, of, albania, as, the, only, socialist, state, after, the, soviet, union, under, stalin, who, first, stated, to, have, achieved, socialism, with, the, 1936, constitution, of, the, soviet, union, war, communism, was, the, first, system, adopted, by, the, bolsheviks, during, the, russian, civil, war, as, a, result, of, the, many, challenges, despite, communism, in, the, name, it, had, nothing, to, do, with, communism, with, strict, discipline, for, workers, strike, actions, forbidden, obligatory, labor, duty, and, military, style, control, and, has, been, described, as, simple, authoritarian, control, by, the, bolsheviks, to, maintain, power, and, control, in, the, soviet, regions, rather, than, any, coherent, political, ideology, the, soviet, union, was, established, in, 1922, before, the, broad, ban, in, 1921, there, were, several, factions, in, the, communist, party, more, prominently, among, them, the, left, opposition, the, right, opposition, and, the, workers, opposition, which, debated, on, the, path, of, development, to, follow, the, left, and, workers, oppositions, were, more, critical, of, the, state, capitalist, development, and, the, workers, in, particular, was, critical, of, bureaucratization, and, development, from, above, while, the, right, opposition, was, more, supporting, of, state, capitalist, development, and, advocated, the, new, economic, policy, following, lenin, s, democratic, centralism, the, leninist, parties, were, organized, on, a, hierarchical, basis, with, active, cells, of, members, as, the, broad, base, they, were, made, up, only, of, elite, cadres, approved, by, higher, members, of, the, party, as, being, reliable, and, completely, subject, to, party, discipline, trotskyism, overtook, the, left, communists, as, the, main, dissident, communist, current, while, more, libertarian, communisms, dating, back, to, the, libertarian, marxist, current, of, council, communism, remained, important, dissident, communisms, outside, the, soviet, union, following, lenin,

any, possible, opposition, within, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, in, the, moscow, trials, many, old, bolsheviks, who, had, played, prominent, roles, during, the, russian, revolution, or, in, lenin, s, soviet, government, afterwards, including, lev, kamenev, grigory, zinoviev, alexei, rykov, and, nikolai, bukharin, were, accused, pleaded, guilty, of, conspiracy, against, the, soviet, union, and, were, executed, the, devastation, of, world, war, ii, resulted, in, a, massive, recovery, program, involving, the, rebuilding, of, industrial, plants, housing, and, transportation, as, well, as, the, demobilization, and, migration, of, millions, of, soldiers, and, civilians, in, the, midst, of, this, turmoil, during, the, winter, of, 1946, 1947, the, soviet, union, experienced, the, worst, natural, famine, in, the, 20th, century, there, was, no, serious, opposition, to, stalin, as, the, secret, police, continued, to, send, possible, suspects, to, the, gulag, relations, with, the, united, states, and, britain, went, from, friendly, to, hostile, as, they, denounced, stalin, s, political, controls, over, eastern, europe, and, his, berlin, blockade, by, 1947, the, cold, war, had, begun, stalin, himself, believed, that, capitalism, was, a, hollow, shell, and, would, crumble, under, increased, non, military, pressure, exerted, through, proxies, in, countries, like, italy, he, greatly, underestimated, the, economic, strength, of, the, west, and, instead, of, triumph, saw, the, west, build, up, alliances, that, were, designed, to, permanently, stop, or, contain, soviet, expansion, in, early, 1950, stalin, gave, the, go, ahead, for, north, korea, s, invasion, of, south, korea, expecting, a, short, war, he, was, stunned, when, the, americans, entered, and, defeated, the, north, koreans, putting, them, almost, on, the, soviet, border, stalin, supported, china, s, entry, into, the, korean, war, which, drove, the, americans, back, to, the, prewar, boundaries, but, which, escalated, tensions, the, united, states, decided, to, mobilize, its, economy, for, a, long, contest, with, the, soviets, built, the, hydrogen, bomb, and, strengthened, the, nato, alliance, that, covered, western, europe, according, to, gorlizki, and, khlevniuk, stalin, s, consistent, and, overriding, goal, after, 1945, was, to, consolidate, the, nation, s, superpower, status, and, in, the, face, of, his, growing, physical, decrepitude, to, maintain, his, own, hold, on, total, power, stalin, created, a, leadership, system, that, reflected, historic, czarist, styles, of, paternalism, and, repression, yet, was, also, quite, modern, at, the, top, personal, loyalty, to, stalin, counted, for, everything, stalin, also, created, powerful, committees, elevated, younger, specialists, and, began, major, institutional, innovations, in, the, teeth, of, persecution, stalin, s, deputies, cultivated, informal, norms, and, mutual, understandings, which, provided, the, foundations, for, collective, rule, after, his, death, for, most, westerners, and, anti, communist, russians, stalin, is, viewed, overwhelmingly, negatively, as, a, mass, murderer, for, significant, numbers, of, russians, and, georgians, he, is, regarded, as, a, great, statesman, and, state, builder, after, the, chinese, civil, war, mao, zedong, and, the, chinese, communist, party, came, to, power, in, 1949, as, the, nationalist, government, headed, by, the, kuomintang, fled, to, the, island, of, taiwan, in, 1950, 1953, china, engaged, in, a, large, scale, undeclared, war, with, the, united, states, south, korea, and, united, nations, forces, in, the, korean, war, while, the, war, ended, in, a, military, stalemate, it, gave, mao, the, opportunity, to, identify, and, purge, elements, in, china, that, seemed, supportive, of, capitalism, at, first, there, was, close, cooperation, with, stalin, who, sent, in, technical, experts, to, aid, the, industrialization, process, along, the, line, of, the, soviet, model, of, the, 1930s, after, stalin, s, death, in, 1953, relations, with, moscow, soured, mao, thought, stalin, s, successors, had, betrayed, the, communist, ideal, mao, charged, that, soviet, leader, nikita, khrushchev, was, the, leader, of, a, revisionist, clique, which, had, turned, against, marxism, and, leninism, and, was, now, setting, the, stage, for, the, restoration, of, capitalism, the, two, nations, were, at, sword, s, point, by, 1960, both, began, forging, alliances, with, communist, supporters, around, the, globe, thereby, splitting, the, worldwide, movement, into, two, hostile, camps, rejecting, the, soviet, model, of, rapid, urbanization, mao, zedong, and, his, top, aide, deng, xiaoping, launched, the, great, leap, forward, in, 1957, 1961, with, the, goal, of, industrializing, china, overnight, using, the, peasant, villages, as, the, base, rather, than, large, cities, private, ownership, of, land, ended, and, the, peasants, worked, in, large, collective, farms, that, were, now, ordered, to, start, up, heavy, industry, operations, such, as, steel, mills, plants, were, built, in, remote, locations, due, to, the, lack, of, technical, experts, managers, transportation, or, needed, facilities, industrialization, failed, and, the, main, result, was, a, sharp, unexpected, decline, in, agricultural, output, which, led, to, mass, famine, and, millions, of, deaths, the, years, of, the, great, leap, forward, in, fact, saw, economic, regression, with, 1958, through, 1961, being, the, only, years, between, 1953, and, 1983, in, which, china, s, economy, saw, negative, growth, political, economist, dwight, perkins, argues, enormous, amounts, of, investment, produced, only, modest, increases, in, production, or, none, at, all, in, short, the, great, leap, was, a, very, expensive, disaster, put, in, charge, of, rescuing, the, economy, deng, adopted, pragmatic, policies, that, the, idealistic, mao, disliked, for, a, while, mao, was, in, the, shadows, but, returned, to, center, stage, and, purged, deng, and, his, allies, in, the, cultural, revolution, 1966, 1976, the, cultural, revolution, was, an, upheaval, that, targeted, intellectuals, and, party, leaders, from, 1966, through, 1976, mao, s, goal, was, to, purify, communism, by, removing, pro, capitalists, and, traditionalists, by, imposing, maoist, orthodoxy, within, the, chinese, communist, party, the, movement, paralyzed, china, politically, and, weakened, the, country, economically, culturally, and, intellectually, for, years, millions, of, people, were, accused, humiliated, stripped, of, power, and, either, imprisoned, killed, or, most, often, sent, to, work, as, farm, laborers, mao, insisted, that, those, he, labelled, revisionists, be, removed, through, violent, class, struggle, the, two, most, prominent, militants, were, marshall, lin, biao, of, the, army, and, mao, s, wife, jiang, qing, china, s, youth, responded, to, mao, s, appeal, by, forming, red, guard, groups, around, the, country, the, movement, spread, into, the, military, urban, workers, and, the, communist, party, leadership, itself, it, resulted, in, widespread, factional, struggles, in, all, walks, of, life, in, the, top, leadership, it, led, to, a, mass, purge, of, senior, officials, who, were, accused, of, taking, a, capitalist, road, most, notably, liu, shaoqi, and, deng, xiaoping, during, the, same, period, mao, s, personality, cult, grew, to, immense, proportions, after, mao, s, death, in, 1976, the, survivors, were, rehabilitated, and, many, returned, to, power, mao, s, government, was, responsible, for, vast, numbers, of, deaths, with, estimates, ranging, from, 40, to, 80, million, victims, through, starvation, persecution, prison, labour, and, mass, executions, mao, has, also, been, praised, for, transforming, china, from, a, semi, colony, to, a, leading, world, power, with, greatly, advanced, literacy, women, s, rights, basic, healthcare, primary, education, and, life, expectancy, its, leading, role, in, world, war, ii, saw, the, emergence, of, the, industrialized, soviet, union, as, a, superpower, marxist, leninist, governments, modeled, on, the, soviet, union, took, power, with, soviet, assistance, in, bulgaria, czechoslovakia, east, germany, poland, hungary, and, romania, a, marxist, leninist, government, was, also, created, under, josip, broz, tito, in, yugoslavia, tito, s, independent, policies, led, to, the, tito, stalin, split, and, expulsion, of, yugoslavia, from, the, cominform, in, 1948, and, titoism, was, branded, deviationist, albania, also, became, an, independent, marxist, leninist, state, following, the, albanian, soviet, split, in, 1960, resulting, from, an, ideological, fallout, between, enver, hoxha, a, stalinist, and, the, soviet, government, of, nikita, khrushchev, who, enacted, a, period, of, de, stalinization, and, re, approached, diplomatic, relations, with, yugoslavia, in, 1976, the, communist, party, of, china, led, by, mao, zedong, established, the, people, s, republic, of, china, which, would, follow, its, own, ideological, path, of, development, following, the, sino, soviet, split, communism, was, seen, as, a, rival, of, and, a, threat, to, western, capitalism, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, in, western, europe, communist, parties, were, part, of, several, post, war, governments, and, even, when, the, cold, war, forced, many, of, those, countries, to, remove, them, from, government, such, as, in, italy, they, remained, part, of, the, liberal, democratic, process, there, were, also, many, developments, in, libertarian, marxism, especially, during, the, 1960s, with, the, new, left, by, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, many, western, communist, parties, had, criticized, many, of, the, actions, of, communist, states, distanced, from, them, and, developed, a, democratic, road, to, socialism, which, became, known, as, eurocommunism, this, development, was, criticized, by, more, orthodox, supporters, of, the, soviet, union, as, amounting, to, social, democracy, since, 1957, communists, have, been, frequently, voted, into, power, in, the, indian, state, of, kerala,

several, other, countries, with, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, fall, of, communism, there, was, a, split, between, those, hardline, communists, sometimes, referred, to, in, the, media, as, neo, stalinists, who, remained, committed, to, orthodox, marxism, leninism, and, those, such, as, the, left, in, germany, who, work, within, the, liberal, democratic, process, for, a, democratic, road, to, socialism, other, ruling, communist, parties, became, closer, to, democratic, socialist, and, social, democratic, parties, outside, communist, states, reformed, communist,

were, part, of, the, 1st, nepalese, constituent, assembly, which, abolished, the, monarchy, in, 2008, and, turned, the, country, into, a, federal, liberal, democratic, republic, and, have, democratically, shared, power, with, other, communists, marxist, leninists, and, maoists, cpn, maoist, social, democrats, nepali, congress, and, others, as, part, of, their, people, s, multiparty, democracy, the, communist, party, of, the, russian, federation, has, some, supporters, but, is, reformist, rather, than, revolutionary, aiming, to, lessen, the, inequalities, of, russia, s, market, economy, chinese, economic, reforms, were, started, in, 1978, under, the, leadership, of, deng, xiaoping, and, since, then, china, has, managed, to, bring, down, the, poverty, rate, from, 53, in, the, mao, era, to, just, 8, in, 2001, after, losing, soviet, subsidies, and, support, vietnam, and, cuba, have, attracted, more, foreign, investment, to, their, countries, with, their, economies, becoming, more, market, oriented, north, korea, the, last, communist, country, that, still, practices, soviet, style, communism, is, both, repressive, and, isolationist, communist, political, thought, and, theory, are, diverse, but, share, several, core, elements, the, dominant, forms, of, communism, are, based, on, marxism, or, leninism, but, non, marxist, versions, of, communism, also, exist, such, as, anarcho, communism, and, christian, communism, which, remain, partly, influenced, by, marxist, theories, such, as, libertarian, marxism, and, humanist, marxism, in, particular, common, elements, include, being, theoretical, rather, than, ideological, identifying, political, parties, not, by, ideology, but, by, class, and, economic, interest, and, identifying, with, the, proletariat, according, to, communists, the, proletariat, can, avoid, mass, unemployment, only, if, capitalism, is, overthrown, in, the, short, run, state, oriented, communists, favor, state, ownership, of, the, commanding, heights, of, the, economy, as, a, means, to, defend, the, proletariat, from, capitalist, pressure, some, communists, are, distinguished, by, other, marxists, in, seeing, peasants, and, smallholders, of, property, as, possible, allies, in, their, goal, of, shortening, the, abolition, of, capitalism, for, leninist, communism, such, goals, including, short, term, proletarian, interests, to, improve, their, political, and, material, conditions, can, only, be, achieved, through, vanguardism, an, elitist, form, of, socialism, from, above, that, relies, on, theoretical, analysis, to, identify, proletarian, interests, rather, than, consulting, the, proletarians, themselves, as, is, advocated, by, libertarian, communists, when, they, engage, in, elections, leninist, communists, main, task, is, that, of, educating, voters, in, what, are, deemed, their, true, interests, rather, than, in, response, to, the, expression, of, interest, by, voters, themselves, when, they, have, gained, control, of, the, state, leninist, communists, main, task, was, preventing, other, political, parties, from, deceiving, the, proletariat, such, as, by, running, their, own, independent, candidates, this, vanguardist, approach, comes, from, their, commitments, to, democratic, centralism, in, which, communists, can, only, be, cadres, i, e, members, of, the, party, who, are, full, time, professional, revolutionaries, as, was, conceived, by, vladimir, lenin, marxism, is, a, method, of, socioeconomic, analysis, that, uses, a, materialist, interpretation, of, historical, development, better, known, as, historical, materialism, to, understand, social, class, relations, and, social, conflict, and, a, dialectical, perspective, to, view, social, transformation, it, originates, from, the, works, of, 19th, century, german, philosophers, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, as, marxism, has, developed, over, time, into, various, branches, and, schools, of, thought, no, single, definitive, marxist, theory, exists, marxism, considers, itself, to, be, the, embodiment, of, scientific, socialism, but, does, not, model, an, ideal, society, based, on, the, design, of, intellectuals, whereby, communism, is, seen, as, a, state, of, affairs, to, be, established, based, on, any, intelligent, design, rather, it, is, a, non, idealist, attempt, at, the, understanding, of, material, history, and, society, whereby, communism, is, the, expression, of, a, real, movement, with, parameters, that, are, derived, from, actual, life, according, to, marxist, theory, class, conflict, arises, in, capitalist, societies, due, to, contradictions, between, the, material, interests, of, the, oppressed, and, exploited, proletariat, a, class, of, wage, laborers, employed, to, produce, goods, and, services, and, the, bourgeoisie, the, ruling, class, that, owns, the, means, of, production, and, extracts, its, wealth, through, appropriation, of, the, surplus, product, produced, by, the, proletariat, in, the, form, of, profit, this, class, struggle, that, is, commonly, expressed, as, the, revolt, of, a, society, s, productive, forces, against, its, relations, of, production, results, in, a, period, of, short, term, crises, as, the, bourgeoisie, struggle, to, manage, the, intensifying, alienation, of, labor, experienced, by, the, proletariat, albeit, with, varying, degrees, of, class, consciousness, in, periods, of, deep, crisis, the, resistance, of, the, oppressed, can, culminate, in, a, proletarian, revolution, which, if, victorious, leads, to, the, establishment, of, the, socialist, mode, of, production, based, on, social, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, to, each, according, to, his, contribution, and, production, for, use, as, the, productive, forces, continued, to, advance, the, communist, society, i, e, a, classless, stateless, humane, society, based, on, common, ownership, follows, the, maxim, from, each, according, to, his, ability, to, each, according, to, his, needs, while, it, originates, from, the, works, of, marx, and, engels, marxism, has, developed, into, many, different, branches, and, schools, of, thought, with, the, result, that, there, is, now, no, single, definitive, marxist, theory, different, marxian, schools, place, a, greater, emphasis, on, certain, aspects, of, classical, marxism, while, rejecting, or, modifying, other, aspects, many, schools, of, thought, have, sought, to, combine, marxian, concepts, and, non, marxian, concepts, which, has, then, led, to, contradictory, conclusions, there, is, a, movement, toward, the, recognition, that, historical, materialism, and, dialectical, materialism, remain, the, fundamental, aspects, of, all, marxist, schools, of, thought, marxism, leninism, and, its, offshoots, are, the, most, well, known, of, these, and, have, been, a, driving, force, in, international, relations, during, most, of, the, 20th, century, classical, marxism, is, the, economic, philosophical, and, sociological, theories, expounded, by, marx, and, engels, as, contrasted, with, later, developments, in, marxism, especially, leninism, and, marxism, leninism, orthodox, marxism, is, the, body, of, marxist, thought, that, emerged, after, the, death, of, marx, and, which, became, the, official, philosophy, of, the, socialist, movement, as, represented, in, the, second, international, until, world, war, i, in, 1914, orthodox, marxism, aims, to, simplify, codify, and, systematize, marxist, method, and, theory, by, clarifying, the, perceived, ambiguities, and, contradictions, of, classical, marxism, the, philosophy, of, orthodox, marxism, includes, the, understanding, that, material, development, advances, in, technology, in, the, productive, forces, is, the, primary, agent, of, change, in, the, structure, of, society, and, of, human, social, relations, and, that, social, systems, and, their, relations, e, g, feudalism, capitalism, and, so, on, become, contradictory, and, inefficient, as, the, productive, forces, develop, which, results, in, some, form, of, social, revolution, arising, in, response, to, the, mounting, contradictions, this, revolutionary, change, is, the, vehicle, for, fundamental, society, wide, changes, and, ultimately, leads, to, the, emergence, of, new, economic, systems, as, a, term, orthodox, marxism, represents, the, methods, of, historical, materialism, and, of, dialectical, materialism, and, not, the, normative, aspects, inherent, to, classical, marxism, without, implying, dogmatic, adherence, to, the, results, of, marx, s, investigations, at, the, root, of, marxism, is, historical, materialism, the, materialist, conception, of, history, which, holds, that, the, key, characteristic, of, economic, systems, through, history, has, been, the, mode, of, production, and, that, the, change, between, modes, of, production, has, been, triggered, by, class, struggle, according, to, this, analysis, the, industrial, revolution, ushered, the, world, into, the, new, capitalist, mode, of, production, before, capitalism, certain, working, classes, had, ownership, of, instruments, used, in, production, however, because, machinery, was, much, more, efficient, this, property, became, worthless, and, the, mass, majority, of, workers, could, only, survive, by, selling, their, labor, to, make, use, of, someone, else, s, machinery, and, making, someone, else, profit, accordingly, capitalism, divided, the, world, between, two, major, classes, namely, that, of, the, proletariat, and, the, bourgeoisie, these, classes, are, directly, antagonistic, as, the, latter, possesses, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, earning, profit, via, the, surplus, value, generated, by, the, proletariat, who, have, no, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, and, therefore, no, option, but, to, sell, its, labor, to, the, bourgeoisie, according, to, the, materialist, conception, of, history, it, is, through, the, furtherance, of, its, own, material, interests, that, the, rising, bourgeoisie, within, feudalism, captured, power, and, abolished, of, all, relations, of, private, property, only, the, feudal, privilege, thereby, taking, the, feudal, ruling, class, out, of, existence, this, was, another, key, element, behind, the, consolidation, of, capitalism, as, the, new, mode, of, production, the, final, expression, of, class, and, property, relations, that, has, led, to, a, massive, expansion, of, production, it, is, only, in, capitalism, that, private, property, in, itself, can, be, abolished, similarly, the, proletariat, would, capture, political, power, abolish, bourgeois, property, through, the, common, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, therefore, abolishing, the, bourgeoisie, ultimately, abolishing, the, proletariat, itself, and, ushering, the, world, into, communism, as, a, new, mode, of, production, in, between, capitalism, and, communism, there, is, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, it, is, the, defeat, of, the, bourgeois, state, but, not, yet, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, and, at, the, same, time, the, only, element, which, places, into, the, realm, of, possibility, moving, on, from, this, mode, of, production, this, dictatorship, based, on, the, paris, commune, s, model, is, to, be, the, most, democratic, state, where, the, whole, of, the, public, authority, is, elected, and, recallable, under, the, basis, of, universal, suffrage, critique, of, political, economy, is, a, form, of, social, critique, that, rejects, the, various, social, categories, and, structures, that, constitute, the, mainstream, discourse, concerning, the, forms, and, modalities, of, resource, allocation, and, income, distribution, in, the, economy, communists, such, as, marx, and, engels, are, described, as, prominent, critics, of, political, economy, the, critique, rejects, economists, use, of, what, its, advocates, believe, are, unrealistic, axioms, faulty, historical, assumptions, and, the, normative, use, of, various, descriptive, narratives, they, reject, what, they, describe, as, mainstream, economists, tendency, to, posit, the, economy, as, an, a, priori, societal, category, those, who, engage, in, critique, of, economy, tend, to, reject, the, view, that, the, economy, and, its, categories, is, to, be, understood, as, something, transhistorical, it, is, seen, as, merely, one, of, many, types, of, historically, specific, ways, to, distribute, resources, they, argue, that, it, is, a, relatively, new, mode, of, resource, distribution, which, emerged, along, with, modernity, critics, of, economy, critique, the, given, status, of, the, economy, itself,

of, metaphysical, concepts, as, well, as, societal, and, normative, practices, rather, than, being, the, result, of, any, self, evident, or, proclaimed, economic, laws, they, also, tend, to, consider,

this, has, led, marxist, groups, and, tendencies, critical, of, the, soviet, model, to, label, states, based, on, nationalization, such, as, the, soviet, union, as, state, capitalist, a, view, that, is, also, shared, by, several, scholars, above, all, it, will, establish, a, democratic, constitution, and, through, this, the, direct, or, indirect, dominance, of, the, proletariat, while, marxists, propose, replacing, the, bourgeois, state, with, a, proletarian, semi, state, through, revolution, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, which, would, eventually, wither, away, anarchists, warn, that,

revolutionary, vanguard, party, as, the, political, prelude, to, the, establishment, of, communism, the, function, of, the, leninist, vanguard, party, is, to, provide, the, working, classes, with,

that, section, which, pushes, forward, all, others, as, the, vanguard, party, the, bolsheviks, viewed, history, through, the, theoretical, framework, of, dialectical, materialism, which, sanctioned,

specific, political, ideology, which, stalin, implemented, in, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, and, in, a, global, scale, in, the, comintern, there, is, no, definite, agreement, between, historians, about, whether, stalin, actually, followed, the, principles, of, marx, and, lenin, it, also, contains, aspects, which, according, to, some, are, deviations, from, marxism, such, as, socialism, in, one, country, marxism, leninism, was, the, official, ideology, of, 20th, century, communist, parties, including, trotskyist, and, was, developed, after, the, death, of, lenin, its,

collectivization, marxism, leninism, is, misleading, because, marx, and, lenin, never, sanctioned, or, supported, the, creation, of, an, ism, after, them, and, is, revealing, because, being, popularized, after, lenin, s, death, by, stalin, it, contained, those, three, doctrinal, and, institutionalized, principles, that, became, a, model, for, later, soviet, type, regimes, its, global,

communism, social, fascism, was, a, theory, supported, by, the, comintern, and, affiliated, communist, parties, during, the, early, 1930s, which, held, that, social, democracy, was, a, variant, of, fascism, because, it, stood, in, the, way, of, a, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, in, addition, to, a, shared, corporatist, economic, model, at, the, time, leaders, of, the, comintern, such, as, stalin, and, rajani, palme, dutt, stated, that, capitalist, society, had, entered, the, third, period, in, which, a, proletariat, revolution, was, imminent, but, could, be, prevented, by, social, democrats, and, other, fascist, forces, the, term, social, fascist, was, used, pejoratively, to, describe, social, democratic, parties, anti, comintern, and, progressive, socialist, parties, and, dissenters, within, comintern, affiliates, throughout, the, interwar, period, the, social, fascism, theory, was, advocated, vociferously, by, the, communist, party, of, germany, which, was, largely, controlled, and, funded, by, the, soviet, leadership, from, 1928, within, marxism, leninism, anti, revisionism, is, a, position, which, emerged, in, the, 1950s, in, opposition, to, the, reforms, and,

movement, remained, dedicated, to, stalin, s, ideological, legacy, and, criticized, the, soviet, union, under, khrushchev, and, his, successors, as, state, capitalist, and, social, imperialist, due, to, its, hopes, of, achieving, peace, with, the, united, states, the, term, stalinism, is, also, used, to, describe, these, positions, but, is, often, not, used, by, its, supporters, who, opine, that, stalin, practiced, orthodox, marxism, and, leninism, because, different, political, trends, trace, the, historical, roots, of, revisionism, to, different, eras, and, leaders, there, is, significant, disagreement, today, as, to, what, constitutes, anti, revisionism, modern, groups, which, describe, themselves, as, anti, revisionist, fall, into, several, categories, some, uphold, the, works, of, stalin, and, mao, zedong, and, some, the, works, of, stalin, while, rejecting, mao, and, universally, tend, to, oppose, trotskyism, others, reject, both, stalin, and, mao, tracing, their, ideological, roots, back, to, marx, and, lenin, in, addition, other, groups, uphold, various, less, well, known, historical, leaders, such, as, enver, hoxha, who, also, broke, with, mao, during, the, sino, albanian, split, social, imperialism, was, a, term, used, by, mao, to, criticize, the, soviet, union, post, stalin, mao, stated, that, the, soviet, union, had, itself, become, an, imperialist, power,

stalinization, whereas, stalinism, did, not, in, the, last, letters, before, his, death, lenin, warned, against, the, danger, of, stalin, s, personality, and, urged, the, soviet, government, to, replace, him, until, the, death, of, joseph, stalin, in, 1953, the, soviet, communist, party, referred, to, its, own, ideology, as, marxism, leninism, stalinism, marxism, leninism, has, been, criticized, by, other, communist, and, marxist, tendencies, which, state, that, marxist, leninist, states, did, not, establish, socialism, but, rather, state, capitalism, according, to, marxism, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, represents, the, rule, of, the, majority, democracy, rather, than, of, one, party, to, the, extent, that, the, co, founder, of, marxism, friedrich, engels, described, its, specific, form, as, the, democratic, republic, according, to, engels, state, property, by, itself, is, private, property, of, capitalist, nature, unless, the, proletariat, has, control, of, political, power, in, which, case, it, forms, public, property, whether, the, proletariat, was, actually, in, control, of, the, marxist, leninist, states, is, a, matter, of, debate, between, marxism, leninism, and, other, communist, tendencies, to, these, tendencies, marxism, leninism, is, neither, marxism, nor, leninism, nor, the, union, of, both, but, rather, an, artificial, term, created, to, justify, stalin, s, ideological, distortion, forced, into, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, comintern, in, the, soviet, union, this, struggle, against, marxism, leninism, was, represented, by, trotskyism, which, describes, itself, as, a, marxist, and, leninist, tendency, trotskyism, developed, by, leon, trotsky, in, opposition, to, stalinism, is, a, marxist, and, leninist, tendency, that, supports, the, theory, of, permanent, revolution, and, world, revolution, rather, than, the, two, stage, theory, and, stalin, s, socialism, in, one, country, it, supported, another, communist, revolution, in, the, soviet, union, and, proletarian, internationalism, rather, than, representing, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, trotsky, claimed, that, the, soviet, union, had, become, a, degenerated, workers, state, under, the, leadership, of, stalin, in, which, class, relations, had, re, emerged, in, a, new, form, trotsky, s, politics, differed, sharply, from, those, of, stalin, and, mao, most, importantly, in, declaring, the, need, for, an, international, proletarian, revolution, rather, than, socialism, in, one, country, and, support, for, a, true, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, based, on, democratic, principles, struggling, against, stalin, for, power, in, the, soviet, union, trotsky, and, his, supporters, organized, into, the, left, opposition, the, platform, of, which, became, known, as, trotskyism, in, particular, trotsky, advocated, for, a, decentralised, form, of, economic, planning, mass, soviet, democratization, elected, representation, of, soviet, socialist, parties, the, tactic, of, a, united, front, against, far, right, parties, cultural, autonomy, for, artistic, movements, voluntary, collectivisation, a, transitional, program, and, socialist, internationalism, trotsky, had, the, support, of, many, party, intellectuals, but, this, was, overshadowed, by, the, huge, apparatus, which, included, the, gpu, and, the, party, cadres, who, were, at, the, disposal, of, stalin, stalin, eventually, succeeded, in, gaining, control, of, the, soviet, regime, and, trotskyist, attempts, to, remove, stalin, from, power, resulted, in, trotsky, s, exile, from, the, soviet, union, in, 1929, while, in, exile, trotsky, continued, his, campaign, against, stalin, founding, in, 1938, the, fourth, international, a,

from, the, 1950s, until, the, deng, xiaoping, chinese, economic, reform, in, the, 1970s, it, was, widely, applied, as, the, guiding, political, and, military, ideology, of, the, communist, party, of, china, and, as, the, theory, guiding, revolutionary, movements, around, the, world, a, key, difference, between, maoism, and, other, forms, of, marxism, leninism, is, that, peasants, should, be, the,

stalinization, marxism, leninism, was, kept, in, the, soviet, union, while, certain, anti, revisionist, tendencies, like, hoxhaism, and, maoism, stated, that, such, had, deviated, from, its, original, concept, different, policies, were, applied, in, albania, and, china, which, became, more, distanced, from, the, soviet, union, from, the, 1960s, groups, who, called, themselves, maoists, or, those, who, upheld, maoism, were, not, unified, around, a, common, understanding, of, maoism, instead, having, their, own, particular, interpretations, of, the, political, philosophical, economical, and, military, works, of, mao, its, adherents, claim, that, as, a, unified, coherent, higher, stage, of, marxism, it, was, not, consolidated, until, the, 1980s, first, being, formalized, by, the, shining,

of, reformist, positions, such, as, those, held, by, social, democrats, libertarian, marxist, currents, often, draw, from, marx, and, engels, later, works, specifically, the, grundrisse, and, the, civil, war, in, france, emphasizing, the, marxist, belief, in, the, ability, of, the, working, class, to, forge, its, own, destiny, without, the, need, for, a, revolutionary, party, or, state, to, mediate, or, aid, its, liberation, along, with, anarchism, libertarian, marxism, is, one, of, the, main, derivatives, of, libertarian, socialism, aside, from, left, communism, libertarian, marxism, includes, such, currents, as, autonomism, communization, council, communism, de, leonism, the, johnson, forest, tendency, lettrism, luxemburgism, situationism, socialisme, ou, barbarie, solidarity, the, world, socialist, movement, and, workerism, as, well, as, parts, of, freudo, marxism, and, the, new, left, moreover, libertarian, marxism, has, often, had, a, strong, influence, on, both, post,

yanis, varoufakis, the, latter, of, whom, claims, that, marx, himself, was, a, libertarian, marxist, council, communism, is, a, movement, that, originated, from, germany, and, the, netherlands, in, the, 1920s, whose, primary, organization, was, the, communist, workers, party, of, germany, it, continues, today, as, a, theoretical, and, activist, position, within, both, libertarian, marxism, and, libertarian, socialism, the, core, principle, of, council, communism, is, that, the, government, and, the, economy, should, be, managed, by, workers, councils, which, are, composed, of, delegates, elected, at, workplaces, and, recallable, at, any, moment, council, communists, oppose, the, perceived, authoritarian, and, undemocratic, nature, of, central, planning, and, of, state, socialism, labelled, state, capitalism, and, the, idea, of, a, revolutionary, party, since, council, communists, believe, that, a, revolution, led, by, a, party, would, necessarily, produce, a, party, dictatorship, council, communists, support, a, workers, democracy, produced, through, a, federation, of, workers, councils, in, contrast, to, those, of, social, democracy, and, leninist, communism, the, central, argument, of, council, communism, is, that, democratic, workers, councils, arising, in, the, factories, and, municipalities, are, the, natural, forms, of, working, class, organizations, and, governmental, power, this, view, is, opposed, to, both, the, reformist, and, the, leninist, communist, ideologies, which, respectively, stress, parliamentary, and, institutional, government, by, applying, social, reforms, on, the, one, hand, and, vanguard, parties, and, participative, democratic, centralism, on, the, other, left, communism, is, the, range, of, communist, viewpoints, held, by, the, communist, left, which, criticizes, the, political, ideas, and, practices, espoused, particularly, following, the, series, of, revolutions, that, brought, world, war, i, to, an, end, by, bolsheviks, and, social, democrats, left, communists, assert, positions, which, they, regard, as, more, authentically, marxist, and, proletarian, than, the, views, of, marxism, leninism, espoused, by, the, communist, international, after, its, first, congress, march, 1919, and, during, its, second, congress, july, august, 1920, left, communists, represent, a, range, of, political, movements, distinct, from, marxist, leninists, whom, they, largely, view, as, merely, the, left, wing, of, capital, from, anarcho, communists, some, of, whom, they, consider, to, be, internationalist, socialists, and, from, various, other, revolutionary, socialist, tendencies, such, as, de, leonists, whom, they, tend, to, see, as, being, internationalist, socialists, only, in, limited, instances, bordigism, is, a, leninist, left, communist, current, named, after, amadeo, bordiga, who, has, been, described, as, being, more, leninist, than, lenin, and, considered, himself, to, be, a, leninist, anarcho, communism, is, a, libertarian, theory, of, anarchism, and, communism, which, advocates, the, abolition, of, the, state, private, property, and, capitalism, in, favor, of, common, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, direct, democracy, and, a, horizontal, network, of, voluntary, associations, and, workers, councils, with, production, and, consumption, based, on, the, guiding, principle, from, each, according, to, his, ability, to, each, according, to, his, need, anarcho, communism, differs, from, marxism, in, that, it, rejects, its, view, about, the, need, for, a, state, socialism, phase, prior, to, establishing, communism, peter, kropotkin, the, main, theorist, of, anarcho, communism, stated, that, a, revolutionary, society, should, transform, itself, immediately, into, a, communist, society, that, it, should, go, immediately, into, what, marx, had, regarded, as, the, more, advanced, completed, phase, of, communism, in, this, way, it, tries, to, avoid, the, reappearance, of, class, divisions, and, the, need, for, a, state, to, be, in, control, some, forms, of, anarcho, communism, such, as, insurrectionary, anarchism, are, egoist, and, strongly, influenced, by, radical, individualism, believing, that, anarchist, communism, does, not, require, a, communitarian, nature, at, all, most, anarcho, communists, view, anarchist, communism, as, a, way, of, reconciling, the, opposition, between, the, individual, and, society, christian, communism, is, a, theological, and, political, theory, based, upon, the, view, that, the, teachings, of, jesus, christ, compel, christians, to, support, religious, communism, as, the, ideal, social, system, although, there, is, no, universal, agreement, on, the, exact, dates, when, communistic, ideas, and, practices, in, christianity, began, many, christian, communists, state, that, evidence, from, the, bible, suggests, that, the, first, christians, including, the, apostles, in, the, new, testament, established, their, own, small, communist, society, in, the, years, following, jesus, death, and, resurrection, many, advocates, of, christian, communism, state, that, it, was, taught, by, jesus, and, practiced, by, the, apostles, themselves, an, argument, that, historians, and, others, including, anthropologist, roman, a, montero, scholars, like, ernest, renan, and, theologians, like, charles, ellicott, and, donald, guthrie, generally, agree, with, christian, communism, enjoys, some, support, in, russia, russian, musician, yegor, letov, was, an, outspoken, christian, communist, and, in, a, 1995, interview, he, was, quoted, as, saying, communism, is, the, kingdom, of, god, on, earth, emily, morris, from, university, college, london, wrote, that, because, karl, marx, s, writings, have, inspired, many, movements, including, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, communism, is, commonly, confused, with, the, political, and, economic, system, that, developed, in, the, soviet, union, after, the, revolution, morris, also, wrote, that, soviet, style, communism, did, not, work, due, to, an, over, centralised, oppressive, bureaucratic, and, rigid, economic, and, political, system, historian, andrzej, paczkowski, summarized, communism, as, an, ideology, that, seemed, clearly, the, opposite, that, was, based, on, the, secular, desire, of, humanity, to, achieve, equality, and, social, justice, and, that, promised, a, great, leap, forward, into, freedom, in, contrast, austrian, american, economist, ludwig, von, mises, argued, that, by, abolishing, free, markets, communist, officials, would, not, have, the, price, system, necessary, to, guide, their, planned, production, anti, communism, developed, as, soon, as, communism, became, a, conscious, political, movement, in, the, 19th, century, and, anti, communist, mass, killings, have, been, reported, against, alleged, communists, or, their, alleged, supporters, which, were, committed, by, anti, communists, and, political, organizations, or, governments, opposed, to, communism, the, communist, movement, has, faced, opposition, since, it, was, founded, and, the, opposition, to, it, has, often, been, organized, and, violent, many, of, these, anti, communist, mass, killing, campaigns, primarily, during, the, cold, war, were, supported, by, the, united, states, and, its, western, bloc, allies, including, those, who, were, formally, part, of, the, non, aligned, movement, such, as, the, indonesian, mass, killings, of, 1965, 66, and, operation, condor, in, south, america, many, authors, have, written, about, excess, deaths, under, communist, states, and, mortality, rates, such, as, excess, mortality, in, the, soviet, union, under, joseph, stalin, some, authors, posit, that, there, is, a, communist, death, toll, whose, death, estimates, vary, widely, depending, on, the, definitions, of, the, deaths, that, are, included, in, them, ranging, from, lows, of, 10, 20, million, to, highs, over, 100, million, the, higher, estimates, have, been, criticized, by, several, scholars, as, ideologically, motivated, and, inflated, they, are, also, criticized, for, being, inaccurate, due, to, incomplete, data, inflated, by, counting, any, excess, death, making, an, unwarranted, link, to, communism, and, the, grouping, and, body, counting, itself, higher, estimates, account, for, actions, that, communist, governments, committed, against, civilians, including, executions, human, made, famines, and, deaths, that, occurred, during, or, resulted, from, imprisonment, and, forced, deportations, and, labor, higher, estimates, are, criticized, for, being, based, on, sparse, and, incomplete, data, when, significant, errors, are, inevitable, and, for, being, skewed, to, higher, possible, values, others, have, argued, that, while, certain, estimates, may, not, be, accurate, quibbling, about, numbers, is, unseemly, what, matters, is, that, many, many, people, were, killed, by, communist, regimes, historian, mark, bradley, wrote, that, while, the, exact, numbers, have, been, in, dispute, the, order, of, magnitude, is, not, there, is, no, consensus, among, genocide, scholars, and, scholars, of, communism, about, whether, some, or, all, the, events, constituted, a, genocide, or, mass, killing, among, genocide, scholars, there, is, no, consensus, on, a, common, terminology, and, the, events, have, been, variously, referred, to, as, excess, mortality, or, mass, deaths, other, terms, used, to, define, some, of, such, killings, include, classicide, crimes, against, humanity, democide, genocide, politicide, holocaust, mass, killing, and, repression, these, scholars, state, that, most, communist, states, did, not, engage, in, mass, killings, benjamin, valentino, proposes, the, category, of, communist, mass, killing, alongside, colonial, counter, guerrilla, and, ethnic, mass, killing, as, a, subtype, of, dispossessive, mass, killing, to, distinguish, it, from, coercive, mass, killing, genocide, scholars, do, not, consider, ideology, or, regime, type, as, an, important, factor, that, explains, mass, killings, some, authors, such, as, john, gray, daniel, goldhagen, and, richard, pipes, consider, the, ideology, of, communism, to, be, a, significant, causative, factor, in, mass, killings, some, connect, killings, in, joseph, stalin, s, soviet, union, mao, zedong, s, china, and, pol, pot, s, cambodia, on, the, basis, that, stalin, influenced, mao, who, influenced, pol, pot, in, all, cases, scholars, say, killings, were, carried, out, as, part, of, a, policy, of, an, unbalanced, modernization, process, of, rapid, industrialization, daniel, goldhagen, argues, that, 20th, century, communist, regimes, have, killed, more, people, than, any, other, regime, type, some, authors, and, politicians, such, as, george, g, watson, allege, that, genocide, was, dictated, in, otherwise, forgotten, works, of, karl, marx, many, commentators, on, the, political, right, point, to, the, mass, deaths, under, communist, states, claiming, them, as, an, indictment, of, communism, opponents, of, this, view, argue, that, these, killings, were, aberrations, caused, by, specific, authoritarian, regimes, and, not, caused, by, communism, itself, and, point, to, mass, deaths, in, wars, and, famines, that, they, argue, were, caused, by, colonialism, capitalism, and, anti, communism, as, a, counterpoint, to, those, killings, according, to, dovid, katz, and, other, historians, a, historical, revisionist, view, of, the, double, genocide, theory, equating, mass, deaths, under, communist, states, with, the, holocaust, is, popular, in, eastern, european, countries, and, the, baltic, states, and, their, approaches, of, history, have, been, incorporated, in, the, european, union, agenda, among, them, the, prague, declaration, in, june, 2008, and, the, european, day, of, remembrance, for, victims, of, stalinism, and, nazism, which, was, proclaimed, by, the, european, parliament, in, august, 2008, and, endorsed, by, the, osce, in, europe, in, july, 2009, some, scholars, in, western, europe, have, rejected, the, comparison, of, the, two, regimes, and, the, equation, of, their, crimes, criticism, of, communism, can, be, divided, into, two, broad, categories, namely, that, criticism, of, communist, party, rule, that, concerns, with, the, practical, aspects, of, 20th, century, communist, states, and, criticism, of, marxism, and, communism, generally, that, concerns, its, principles, and, theory, public, memory, of, 20th, century, communist, states, has, been, described, as, a, battleground, between, the, communist, sympathetic, or, anti, anti, communist, political, left, and, the, anti, communism, of, the, political, right, critics, of, communism, on, the, political, right, point, to, the, excess, deaths, under, communist, states, as, an, indictment, of, communism, as, an, ideology, defenders, of, communism, on, the, political, left, say, that, the, deaths, were, caused, by, specific, authoritarian, regimes, and, not, communism, as, an, ideology, while, also, pointing, to, anti, communist, mass, killings, and, deaths, in, wars, that, they, argue, were, caused, by, capitalism, and, anti, communism, as, a, counterpoint, to, the, deaths, under, communist, states, according, to, hungarian, sociologist, and, politician, andr, s, boz, ki, positive, aspects, of, communist, countries, included, support, for, social, mobility, and, equality, the, elimination, of, illiteracy, urbanization, more, accessible, healthcare, and, housing, regional, mobility, with, public, transportation, the, elimination, of, semi, feudal, hierarchies, more, women, entering, the, labor, market, and, free, access, to, higher, education, negative, aspects, of, communist, countries, on, the, other, hand, according, to, boz, ki, included, the, suppression, of, freedom, the, loss, of, trust, in, civil, society, a, culture, of, fear, and, corruption, reduced, international, travel, dependency, on, the, party, and, state, central, europe, becoming, a, satellite, of, the, soviet, union, the, creation, of, closed, societies, leading, to, xenophobia, racism, prejudice, cynicism, and, pessimism, women, only, being, emancipated, in, the, workforce, the, oppression, of, national, identity, and, relativist, ethical, societal, standards, memory, studies, have, been, done, on, how, the, events, are, memorized, according, to, kristen, r, ghodsee, and, scott, sehon, on, the, political, left, there, are, those, with, some, sympathy, for, socialist, ideals, and, the, popular, opinion, of, hundreds, of, millions, of, russian, and, east, european, citizens, nostalgic, for, their, state, socialist, pasts, while, on, the, political, right, there, are, the, committed, anti, totalitarians, both, east, and, west, insisting, that, all, experiments, with, marxism, will, always, and, inevitably, end, with, the, gulag, the, victims, of, communism, concept, has, become, accepted, scholarship, as, part, of, the, double, genocide, theory, in, eastern, europe, and, among, anti, communists, in, general, it, is, rejected, by, some, western, european, and, other, scholars, especially, when, it, is, used, to, equate, communism, and, nazism, which, is, seen, by, scholars, as, a, long, discredited, perspective, the, narrative, posits, that, famines, and, mass, deaths, by, communist, states, can, be, attributed, to, a, single, cause, and, that, communism, as, the, deadliest, ideology, in, history, or, in, the, words, of, jonathan, rauch, as, the, deadliest, fantasy, in, human, history, represents, the, greatest, threat, to, humanity, proponents, posit, an, alleged, link, between, communism, left, wing, politics, and, socialism, with, genocide, mass, killing, and, totalitarianism, some, authors, as, st, phane, courtois, propose, a, theory, of, equivalence, between, class, and, racial, genocide, it, is, supported, by, the, victims, of, communism, memorial, foundation, with, 100, million, being, the, most, common, estimate, used, from, the, black, book, of, communism, despite, some, of, the, authors, of, the, book, distancing, themselves, from, the, estimates, made, by, stephen, courtois, various, museums, and, monuments, have, been, constructed, in, remembrance, of, the, victims, of, communism, with, support, of, the, european, union, and, various, governments, in, canada, eastern, europe, and, the, united, states, works, such, as, the, black, book, of, communism, and, bloodlands, legitimized, debates, on, the, comparison, of, nazism, and, stalinism, and, by, extension, communism, and, the, former, work, in, particular, was, important, in, the, criminalization, of, communism, according, to, freedom, house, communism, is, considered, one, of, the, two, great, totalitarian, movements, of, the, 20th, century, the, other, being, nazism, but, added, that, there, is, an, important, difference, in, how, the, world, has, treated, these, two, execrable, phenomena, the, failure, of, communist, governments, to, live, up, to, the, ideal, of, a, communist, society, their, general, trend, towards, increasing, authoritarianism, their, bureaucracy, and, the, inherent, inefficiencies, in, their, economies, have, been, linked, to, the, decline, of, communism, in, the, late, 20th, century, walter, scheidel, stated, that, despite, wide, reaching, government, actions, communist, states, failed, to, achieve, long, term, economic, social, and, political, success, the, experience, of, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, the, north, korean, famine, and, alleged, economic, underperformance, when, compared, to, developed, free, market, systems, are, cited, as, examples, of, communist, states, failing, to, build, a, successful, state, while, relying, entirely, on, what, they, view, as, orthodox, marxism, despite, those, shortcomings, philipp, ther, stated, that, there, was, a, general, increase, in, the, standard, of, living, throughout, eastern, bloc, countries, as, the, result, of, modernization, programs, under, communist, governments, most, experts, agree, there, was, a, significant, increase, in, mortality, rates, following, the, years, 1989, and, 1991, including, a, 2014, world, health, organization, report, which, concluded, that, the, health, of, people, in, the, former, soviet, countries, deteriorated, dramatically, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, post, communist, russia, during, the, imf, backed, economic, reforms, of, boris, yeltsin, experienced, surging, economic, inequality, and, poverty, as, unemployment, reached, double, digits, by, the, early, to, mid, 1990s, by, contrast, the, central, european, states, of, the, former, eastern, bloc, czech, republic, hungary, poland, and, slovakia, showed, healthy, increases, in, life, expectancy, from, the, 1990s, onward, compared, to, nearly, thirty, years, of, stagnation, under, communism, bulgaria, and, romania, followed, this, trend, after, the, introduction, of, more, serious, economic, reforms, in, the, late, 1990s, the, economies, of, eastern, bloc, countries, had, previously, experienced, stagnation, in, the, 1980s, under, communism, a, common, expression, throughout, eastern, europe, after, 1989, was, everything, they, told, us, about, communism, was, a, lie, but, everything, they, told, us, about, capitalism, was, true, 192, the, right, libertarian, think, tank, cato, institute, has, stated, that, the, analyses, done, of, post, communist, countries, in, the, 1990s, were, premature, and, that, early, and, rapid, reformers, by, far, outperformed, gradual, reformers, on, gdp, per, capita, the, united, nations, human, development, index, and, political, freedom, in, addition, to, developing, better, institutions, the, institute, also, stated, that, the, process, of, privatization, in, russia, was, deeply, flawed, due, to, russia, s, reforms, being, far, less, rapid, than, those, of, central, europe, and, the, baltic, states, the, average, post, communist, country, had, returned, to, 1989, levels, of, per, capita, gdp, by, 2005, however, branko, milanovi, wrote, in, 2015, that, following, the, end, of, the, cold, war, many, of, those, countries, economies, declined, to, such, an, extent, during, the, transition, to, capitalism, that, they, have, yet, to, return, to, the, point, they, were, prior, to, the, collapse, of, communism, several, scholars, state, that, the, negative, economic, developments, in, post, communist, countries, after, the, fall, of, communism, led, to, increased, nationalist, sentiment, and, nostalgia, for, the, communist, era, in, 2011, the, guardian, published, an, analysis, of, the, former, soviet, countries, twenty, years, after, the, fall, of, the, ussr, they, found, that, gdp, fell, as, much, as, 50, percent, in, the, 1990s, in, some, republics, as, capital, flight, industrial, collapse, hyperinflation, and, tax, avoidance, took, their, toll, but, that, there, was, a, rebound, in, the, 2000s, and, by, 2010, some, economies, were, five, times, as, big, as, they, were, in, 1991, life, expectancy, has, grown, since, 1991, in, some, of, the, countries, but, fallen, in, others, likewise, some, held, free, and, fair, elections, while, others, remained, authoritarian, by, 2019, the, majority, of, people, in, most, eastern, european, countries, approved, of, the, shift, to, multiparty, democracy, and, a, market, economy, with, approval, being, highest, among, residents, of, poland, and, residents, in, the, territory, of, what, was, once, east, germany, and, disapproval, being, the, highest, among, residents, of, russia, and, ukraine, in, addition, 61, percent, said, that, standards, of, living, were, now, higher, than, they, had, been, under, communism, while, only, 31, percent, said, that, they, were, worse, with, the, remaining, 8, percent, saying, that, they, did, not, know, or, that, standards, of, living, had, not, changed, according, to, grigore, pop, eleches, and, joshua, tucker, in, their, book, communism, s, shadow, historical, legacies, and, contemporary, political, attitudes, citizens, of, post, communist, countries, are, less, supportive, of, democracy, and, more, supportive, of, government, provided, social, welfare, they, also, found, that, those, who, lived, under, communist, rule, were, more, likely, to, be, left, authoritarian, referencing, the, right, wing, authoritarian, personality, than, citizens, of, other, countries, those, who, are, left, authoritarian, in, this, sense, more, often, tend, to, be, older, generations, that, lived, under, communism, in, contrast, younger, post, communist, generations, continue, to, be, anti, democratic, but, are, not, as, left, wing, ideologically, which, in, the, words, of, pop, eleches, and, tucker, might, help, explain, the, growing, popularity, of, right, wing, populists, in, the, region, conservatives, liberals, and, social, democrats, generally, view, 20th, century, communist, states, as, unqualified, failures, political, theorist, and, professor, jodi, dean, argues, that, this, limits, the, scope, of, discussion, around, political, alternatives, to, capitalism, and, neoliberalism, dean, argues, that, when, people, think, of, capitalism, they, do, not, consider, what, are, its, worst, results, climate, change, economic, inequality, hyperinflation, the, great, depression, the, great, recession, the, robber, barons, and, unemployment, because, the, history, of, capitalism, is, viewed, as, dynamic, and, nuanced, the, history, of, communism, is, not, considered, dynamic, or, nuanced, and, there, is, a, fixed, historical, narrative, of, communism, that, emphasizes, authoritarianism, the, gulag, starvation, and, violence, ghodsee, along, with, the, historians, gary, gerstle, and, walter, scheidel, suggest, that, the, rise, and, fall, of, communism, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, development, and, decline, of, labor, movements, and, social, welfare, states, in, the, united, states, and, other, western, societies, gerstle, argues, that, organized, labor, in, the, united, states, was, strongest, when, the, threat, of, communism, reached, its, peak, and, the, decline, of, both, organized, labor, and, the, welfare, state, coincided, with, the, collapse, of, communism, both, gerstle, and, scheidel, posit, that, as, economic, elites, in, the, west, became, more, fearful, of, possible, communist, revolutions, in, their, own, societies, especially, as, the, tyranny, and, violence, associated, with, communist, governments, became, more, apparent, the, more, willing, they, were, to, compromise, with, the, working, class, and, much, less, so, once, the, threat, waned
