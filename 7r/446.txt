the, egyptian, language, or, ancient, egyptian, r, n, km, t, is, an, extinct, branch, of, the, afro, asiatic, languages, that, was, spoken, in, ancient, egypt, it, is, known, today, from, a, large, corpus, of, surviving, texts, which, were, made, accessible, to, the, modern, world, following, the, decipherment, of, the, ancient, egyptian, scripts, in, the, early, 19th, century, egyptian, is, one, of, the, earliest, known, written, languages, first, recorded, in, the, hieroglyphic, script, in, the, late, 4th, millennium, bc, it, is, also, the, longest, attested, human, language, with, a, written, record, spanning, over, 4, 000, years, its, classical, form, known, as, middle, egyptian, served, as, the, vernacular, of, the, middle, kingdom, of, egypt, and, remained, the, literary, language, of, egypt, until, the, roman, period, by, the, time, of, classical, antiquity, the, spoken, language, had, evolved, into, demotic, and, by, the, roman, era, diversified, into, various, coptic, dialects, these, were, eventually, supplanted, by, arabic, after, the, muslim, conquest, of, egypt, although, bohairic, coptic, remains, in, use, as, the, liturgical, language, of, the, coptic, church, the, egyptian, language, branch, belongs, to, the, afroasiatic, language, family, among, the, typological, features, of, egyptian, that, are, typically, afroasiatic, are, its, fusional, morphology, nonconcatenative, morphology, a, series, of, emphatic, consonants, a, three, vowel, system, a, i, u, a, nominal, feminine, suffix, at, a, nominal, prefix, m, an, adjectival, suffix, and, characteristic, personal, verbal, affixes, of, the, other, afroasiatic, branches, linguists, have, variously, suggested, that, the, egyptian, language, shares, its, greatest, affinities, with, berber, and, semitic, languages, particularly, arabic, which, is, spoken, in, egypt, today, and, hebrew, however, other, scholars, have, argued, that, the, egyptian, language, shared, closer, linguistic, ties, with, northeastern, african, regions, there, are, two, theories, that, seek, to, establish, the, cognate, sets, between, egyptian, and, afroasiatic, the, traditional, theory, and, the, neuere, komparatistik, founded, by, semiticist, otto, r, ssler, according, to, the, neuere, komparatistik, in, egyptian, the, proto, afroasiatic, voiced, consonants, d, z, developed, into, pharyngeal, egyptian, r, t, portal, semitic, dalt, door, the, traditional, theory, instead, disputes, the, values, given, to, those, consonants, by, the, neuere, komparatistik, instead, connecting, with, semitic, and, both, schools, agree, that, afroasiatic, l, merged, with, egyptian, n, r, and, j, in, the, dialect, on, which, the, written, language, was, based, but, it, was, preserved, in, other, egyptian, varieties, they, also, agree, that, original, k, g, palatalise, to, j, in, some, environments, and, are, preserved, as, k, g, q, in, others, the, egyptian, language, has, many, biradical, and, perhaps, monoradical, roots, in, contrast, to, the, semitic, preference, for, triradical, roots, egyptian, is, probably, more, conservative, and, semitic, likely, underwent, later, regularizations, converting, roots, into, the, triradical, pattern, although, egyptian, is, the, oldest, afroasiatic, language, documented, in, written, form, its, morphological, repertoire, is, very, different, from, that, of, the, rest, of, the, afroasiatic, languages, in, general, and, semitic, languages, in, particular, there, are, multiple, possibilities, perhaps, egyptian, had, already, undergone, radical, changes, from, proto, afroasiatic, before, it, was, recorded, or, the, afroasiatic, family, has, so, far, been, studied, with, an, excessively, semitocentric, approach, or, as, g, w, tsereteli, suggests, afroasiatic, is, an, allogenetic, rather, than, a, genetic, group, of, languages, the, egyptian, language, can, be, grouped, thus, the, egyptian, language, is, conventionally, grouped, into, six, major, chronological, divisions, old, middle, and, late, egyptian, were, all, written, using, both, the, hieroglyphic, and, hieratic, scripts, demotic, is, the, name, of, the, script, derived, from, the, hieratic, beginning, in, the, 7th, century, bc, the, coptic, alphabet, was, derived, from, the, greek, alphabet, with, adaptations, for, egyptian, phonology, it, was, first, developed, in, the, ptolemaic, period, and, gradually, replaced, the, demotic, script, in, about, the, 4th, to, 5th, centuries, of, the, christian, era, the, term, archaic, egyptian, is, sometimes, reserved, for, the, earliest, use, of, hieroglyphs, from, the, late, fourth, through, the, early, third, millennia, bc, at, the, earliest, stage, around, 3300, bc, hieroglyphs, were, not, a, fully, developed, writing, system, being, at, a, transitional, stage, of, proto, writing, over, the, time, leading, up, to, the, 27th, century, bc, grammatical, features, such, as, nisba, formation, can, be, seen, to, occur, old, egyptian, is, dated, from, the, oldest, known, complete, sentence, including, a, finite, verb, which, has, been, found, discovered, in, the, tomb, of, seth, peribsen, dated, c, 2690, bc, the, seal, impression, reads, extensive, texts, appear, from, about, 2600, bc, an, early, example, is, the, diary, of, merer, the, pyramid, texts, are, the, largest, body, of, literature, written, in, this, phase, of, the, language, one, of, its, distinguishing, characteristics, is, the, tripling, of, ideograms, phonograms, and, determinatives, to, indicate, the, plural, overall, it, does, not, differ, significantly, from, middle, egyptian, the, classical, stage, of, the, language, though, it, is, based, on, a, different, dialect, in, the, period, of, the, 3rd, dynasty, c, 2650, c, 2575, bc, many, of, the, principles, of, hieroglyphic, writing, were, regularized, from, that, time, on, until, the, script, was, supplanted, by, an, early, version, of, coptic, about, the, third, and, fourth, centuries, the, system, remained, virtually, unchanged, even, the, number, of, signs, used, remained, constant, at, about, 700, for, more, than, 2, 000, years, middle, egyptian, was, spoken, for, about, 700, years, beginning, around, 2000, bc, during, the, middle, kingdom, and, the, subsequent, second, intermediate, period, as, the, classical, variant, of, egyptian, middle, egyptian, is, the, best, documented, variety, of, the, language, and, has, attracted, the, most, attention, by, far, from, egyptology, while, most, middle, egyptian, is, seen, written, on, monuments, by, hieroglyphs, it, was, also, written, using, a, cursive, variant, and, the, related, hieratic, middle, egyptian, first, became, available, to, modern, scholarship, with, the, decipherment, of, hieroglyphs, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, first, grammar, of, middle, egyptian, was, published, by, adolf, erman, in, 1894, surpassed, in, 1927, by, alan, gardiner, s, work, middle, egyptian, has, been, well, understood, since, then, although, certain, points, of, the, verbal, inflection, remained, open, to, revision, until, the, mid, 20th, century, notably, due, to, the, contributions, of, hans, jakob, polotsky, the, middle, egyptian, stage, is, taken, to, have, ended, around, the, 14th, century, bc, giving, rise, to, late, egyptian, this, transition, was, taking, place, in, the, later, period, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, of, egypt, known, as, the, amarna, period, original, old, egyptian, and, middle, egyptian, texts, were, still, used, after, the, 14th, century, bce, and, an, emulation, of, predominately, middle, egyptian, but, also, with, characteristics, of, old, egyptian, late, egyptian, and, demotic, called, gyptien, de, tradition, or, neo, middle, egyptian, by, scholars, was, used, as, a, literary, language, for, new, texts, since, the, later, new, kingdom, in, official, and, religious, hieroglyphic, and, hieratic, texts, in, preference, to, late, egyptian, or, demotic, gyptien, de, tradition, as, a, religious, language, survived, until, the, christianisation, of, roman, egypt, in, the, 4th, century, late, egyptian, was, spoken, for, about, 650, years, beginning, around, 1350, bc, during, the, new, kingdom, of, egypt, late, egyptian, succeeded, but, did, not, fully, supplant, middle, egyptian, as, a, literary, language, and, was, also, the, language, of, the, new, kingdom, administration, texts, written, wholly, in, late, egyptian, date, to, the, twentieth, dynasty, of, egypt, and, later, late, egyptian, is, represented, by, a, large, body, of, religious, and, secular, literature, comprising, such, examples, as, the, story, of, wenamun, the, love, poems, of, the, chester, beatty, i, papyrus, and, the, instruction, of, any, instructions, became, a, popular, literary, genre, of, the, new, kingdom, which, took, the, form, of, advice, on, proper, behavior, late, egyptian, was, also, the, language, of, new, kingdom, administration, late, egyptian, is, not, completely, distinct, from, middle, egyptian, as, many, classicisms, appear, in, historical, and, literary, documents, of, this, phase, however, the, difference, between, middle, and, late, egyptian, is, greater, than, the, difference, between, middle, and, old, egyptian, originally, a, synthetic, language, egyptian, by, the, late, egyptian, phase, had, become, an, analytic, language, the, relationship, between, middle, egyptian, and, late, egyptian, has, been, described, as, being, similar, to, that, between, latin, and, italian, the, late, egyptian, stage, is, taken, to, have, ended, around, the, 8th, century, bc, giving, rise, to, demotic, demotic, is, a, later, development, of, the, egyptian, language, written, in, the, demotic, script, following, late, egyptian, and, preceding, coptic, the, latter, of, which, it, shares, much, with, in, the, earlier, stages, of, demotic, such, as, those, texts, written, in, the, early, demotic, script, it, probably, represented, the, spoken, idiom, of, the, time, however, as, its, use, became, increasingly, confined, to, literary, and, religious, purposes, the, written, language, diverged, more, and, more, from, the, spoken, form, leading, to, significant, diglossia, between, the, late, demotic, texts, and, the, spoken, language, of, the, time, similar, to, the, use, of, classical, middle, egyptian, during, the, ptolemaic, period, coptic, is, the, name, given, to, the, late, egyptian, vernacular, when, it, was, written, in, a, greek, based, alphabet, the, coptic, alphabet, it, flourished, from, the, time, of, early, christianity, c, 31, 33, 324, but, egyptian, phrases, written, in, the, greek, alphabet, first, appeared, during, the, hellenistic, period, c, 3rd, century, bc, with, the, first, known, coptic, text, still, pagan, old, coptic, from, the, 1st, century, ad, coptic, survived, into, the, medieval, period, but, by, the, 16th, century, was, dwindling, rapidly, due, to, the, persecution, of, coptic, christians, under, the, mamluks, it, probably, survived, in, the, egyptian, countryside, as, a, spoken, language, for, several, centuries, after, that, coptic, survives, as, the, liturgical, language, of, the, coptic, orthodox, church, and, the, coptic, catholic, church, most, hieroglyphic, egyptian, texts, are, written, in, a, literary, prestige, register, rather, than, the, vernacular, speech, variety, of, their, author, as, a, result, dialectical, differences, are, not, apparent, in, written, egyptian, until, the, adoption, of, the, coptic, alphabet, nevertheless, it, is, clear, that, these, differences, existed, before, the, coptic, period, in, one, late, egyptian, letter, dated, c, 1200, bc, a, scribe, jokes, that, his, colleague, s, writing, is, incoherent, like, the, speech, of, a, delta, man, with, a, man, of, elephantine, recently, some, evidence, of, internal, dialects, has, been, found, in, pairs, of, similar, words, in, egyptian, that, based, on, similarities, with, later, dialects, of, coptic, may, be, derived, from, northern, and, southern, dialects, of, egyptian, written, coptic, has, five, major, dialects, which, differ, mainly, in, graphic, conventions, most, notably, the, southern, saidic, dialect, the, main, classical, dialect, and, the, northern, bohairic, dialect, currently, used, in, coptic, church, services, most, surviving, texts, in, the, egyptian, language, are, written, on, stone, in, hieroglyphs, the, native, name, for, egyptian, hieroglyphic, writing, is, z, n, mdw, n, r, writing, of, the, gods, words, in, antiquity, most, texts, were, written, on, the, quite, perishable, medium, of, papyrus, though, a, few, have, survived, that, were, written, in, hieratic, and, later, demotic, there, was, also, a, form, of, cursive, hieroglyphs, used, for, religious, documents, on, papyrus, such, as, the, book, of, the, dead, of, the, twentieth, dynasty, it, was, simpler, to, write, than, the, hieroglyphs, in, stone, inscriptions, but, it, was, not, as, cursive, as, hieratic, and, lacked, the, wide, use, of, ligatures, additionally, there, was, a, variety, of, stone, cut, hieratic, known, as, lapidary, hieratic, in, the, language, s, final, stage, of, development, the, coptic, alphabet, replaced, the, older, writing, system, hieroglyphs, are, employed, in, two, ways, in, egyptian, texts, as, ideograms, to, represent, the, idea, depicted, by, the, pictures, and, more, commonly, as, phonograms, to, represent, their, phonetic, value, as, the, phonetic, realization, of, egyptian, cannot, be, known, with, certainty, egyptologists, use, a, system, of, transliteration, to, denote, each, sound, that, could, be, represented, by, a, uniliteral, hieroglyph, egyptian, scholar, gamal, mokhtar, noted, that, the, inventory, of, hieroglyphic, symbols, derived, from, fauna, and, flora, used, in, the, signs, are, essentially, african, reflecting, the, local, wildlife, of, north, africa, the, levant, and, southern, mediterranean, in, regards, to, writing, we, have, seen, that, a, purely, nilotic, hence, african, origin, not, only, is, not, excluded, but, probably, reflects, the, reality, that, the, geographical, location, of, egypt, is, of, course, in, africa, while, the, consonantal, phonology, of, the, egyptian, language, may, be, reconstructed, the, exact, phonetics, is, unknown, and, there, are, varying, opinions, on, how, to, classify, the, individual, phonemes, in, addition, because, egyptian, is, recorded, over, a, full, 2, 000, years, the, archaic, and, late, stages, being, separated, by, the, amount, of, time, that, separates, old, latin, from, modern, italian, significant, phonetic, changes, must, have, occurred, during, that, lengthy, time, frame, phonologically, egyptian, contrasted, labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and, glottal, consonants, egyptian, also, contrasted, voiceless, and, emphatic, consonants, as, with, other, afroasiatic, languages, but, exactly, how, the, emphatic, consonants, were, realised, is, unknown, early, research, had, assumed, that, the, opposition, in, stops, was, one, of, voicing, but, it, is, now, thought, to, be, either, one, of, tenuis, and, emphatic, consonants, as, in, many, semitic, languages, or, one, of, aspirated, and, ejective, consonants, as, in, many, cushitic, languages, since, vowels, were, not, written, until, coptic, reconstructions, of, the, egyptian, vowel, system, are, much, more, uncertain, and, rely, mainly, on, evidence, from, coptic, and, records, of, egyptian, words, especially, proper, nouns, in, other, languages, writing, systems, the, actual, pronunciations, reconstructed, by, such, means, are, used, only, by, a, few, specialists, in, the, language, for, all, other, purposes, the, egyptological, pronunciation, is, used, but, it, often, bears, little, resemblance, to, what, is, known, of, how, egyptian, was, pronounced, the, following, consonants, are, reconstructed, for, archaic, before, 2600, bc, and, old, egyptian, 2686, 2181, bc, with, ipa, equivalents, in, square, brackets, if, they, differ, from, the, usual, transcription, scheme, l, has, no, independent, representation, in, the, hieroglyphic, orthography, and, it, is, frequently, written, as, if, it, were, n, or, r, that, is, probably, because, the, standard, for, written, egyptian, is, based, on, a, dialect, in, which, l, had, merged, with, other, sonorants, also, the, rare, cases, of, occurring, are, not, represented, the, phoneme, j, is, written, as, j, in, the, initial, position, jt, ja, tvj, father, and, immediately, after, a, stressed, vowel, bjn, ba, jin, bad, and, as, jj, word, medially, immediately, before, a, stressed, vowel, jjk, a, jak, you, will, appear, and, are, unmarked, word, finally, jt, ja, tvj, father, in, middle, egyptian, 2055, 1650, bc, a, number, of, consonantal, shifts, take, place, by, the, beginning, of, the, middle, kingdom, period, z, and, s, had, merged, and, the, graphemes, s, and, z, are, used, interchangeably, in, addition, j, had, become, word, initially, in, an, unstressed, syllable, jwn, ja, win, a, win, colour, and, after, a, stressed, vowel, jpw, ujpvw, e, p, vw, apis, in, late, egyptian, 1069, 700, bc, the, phonemes, d, g, gradually, merge, with, their, counterparts, t, k, dbn, di, ban, akkadian, transcription, ti, ba, an, dbn, weight, also, often, become, t, d, but, they, are, retained, in, many, lexemes, becomes, and, t, r, j, w, become, at, the, end, of, a, stressed, syllable, and, eventually, null, word, finally, p, t, pi, at, akkadian, transcription, pi, ta, bow, the, most, important, source, of, information, about, demotic, phonology, is, coptic, the, consonant, inventory, of, demotic, can, be, reconstructed, on, the, basis, of, evidence, from, the, coptic, dialects, demotic, orthography, is, relatively, opaque, the, demotic, alphabetical, signs, are, mostly, inherited, from, the, hieroglyphic, script, and, due, to, historical, sound, changes, they, do, not, always, map, neatly, onto, demotic, phonemes, however, the, demotic, script, does, feature, certain, orthographic, innovations, such, as, the, use, of, the, sign, h, for, which, allow, it, to, represent, sounds, that, were, not, present, in, earlier, forms, of, egyptian, the, demotic, consonants, can, be, divided, into, two, primary, classes, obstruents, stops, affricates, and, fricatives, and, sonorants, approximants, nasals, and, semivowels, voice, is, not, a, contrastive, feature, all, obstruents, are, voiceless, and, all, sonorants, are, voiced, stops, may, be, either, aspirated, or, tenuis, unaspirated, although, there, is, evidence, that, aspirates, merged, with, their, tenuis, counterparts, in, certain, environments, the, following, table, presents, the, consonants, of, demotic, egyptian, the, reconstructed, value, of, a, phoneme, is, given, in, ipa, transcription, followed, by, a, transliteration, of, the, corresponding, demotic, alphabetical, sign, s, in, angle, brackets, more, changes, occur, in, the, 1st, millennium, bc, and, the, first, centuries, ad, leading, to, coptic, 1st, or, 3rd, c, 19th, centuries, ad, in, sahidic, had, merged, into, most, often, from, and, h, most, often, bohairic, and, akhmimic, are, more, conservative, and, have, a, velar, fricative, x, in, bohairic, in, akhmimic, pharyngeal, had, merged, into, glottal, after, it, had, affected, the, quality, of, the, surrounding, vowels, is, not, indicated, orthographically, unless, it, follows, a, stressed, vowel, then, it, is, marked, by, doubling, the, vowel, letter, except, in, bohairic, akhmimic, xo, p, sahidic, and, lycopolitan, o, p, bohairic, o, p, to, be, pr, w, apraw, has, become, the, phoneme, b, was, probably, pronounced, as, a, fricative, becoming, p, after, a, stressed, vowel, in, syllables, that, had, been, closed, in, earlier, egyptian, compare, na, baw, gold, and, dib, horn, the, phonemes, d, g, z, occur, only, in, greek, loanwords, with, rare, exceptions, triggered, by, a, nearby, n, t, n, t, sb, w, school, earlier, d, g, q, are, preserved, as, ejective, t, c, k, k, before, vowels, in, coptic, although, the, same, graphemes, are, used, for, the, pulmonic, stops, the, existence, of, the, former, may, be, inferred, because, the, stops, p, t, c, k, are, allophonically, aspirated, before, stressed, vowels, and, sonorant, consonants, in, bohairic, the, allophones, are, written, with, the, special, graphemes, but, other, dialects, did, not, mark, aspiration, sahidic, bohairic, the, sun, thus, bohairic, does, not, mark, aspiration, for, reflexes, of, older, d, g, q, sahidic, and, bohairic, dib, horn, also, the, definite, article, is, unaspirated, when, the, next, word, begins, with, a, glottal, stop, bohairic, the, account, the, consonant, system, of, coptic, is, as, follows, here, is, the, vowel, system, reconstructed, for, earlier, egyptian, vowels, are, always, short, in, unstressed, syllables, tpj, ta, pij, first, and, long, in, open, stressed, syllables, rm, ra, mac, man, but, they, can, be, either, short, or, long, in, closed, stressed, syllables, jnn, ja, nan, we, mn, ma, n, to, stay, in, the, late, new, kingdom, after, ramses, ii, around, 1200, bc, a, changes, to, o, like, the, canaanite, shift, rw, the, god, horus, a, ra, o, r, akkadian, transcription, uru, u, therefore, changes, to, e, nj, tree, u, n, j, e, n, akkadian, transcription, sini, in, the, early, new, kingdom, short, stressed, i, changes, to, e, mnj, menes, ma, nij, ma, ne, akkadian, transcription, ma, n, e, later, probably, 1000, 800, bc, a, short, stressed, u, changes, to, e, n, t, tanis, u, nat, was, borrowed, into, hebrew, as, u, n, but, would, become, transcribed, as, e, e, nu, a, a, nu, during, the, neo, assyrian, empire, unstressed, vowels, especially, after, a, stress, become, nfr, good, na, fir, na, f, akkadian, transcription, na, a, pa, i, changes, to, e, next, to, and, j, w, w, soldier, wi, iw, we, earlier, akkadian, transcription, i, later, e, e, in, sahidic, and, bohairic, coptic, late, egyptian, stressed, a, becomes, o, and, e, becomes, a, but, are, unchanged, in, the, other, dialects, however, in, the, presence, of, guttural, fricatives, sahidic, and, bohairic, preserve, a, and, fayyumic, renders, it, as, e, in, akhmimic, and, lycopolitan, a, becomes, o, before, etymological, similarly, the, diphthongs, aj, aw, which, normally, have, reflexes, oj, ow, in, sahidic, and, are, preserved, in, other, dialects, are, in, bohairic, i, in, non, final, position, and, ou, respectively, sahidic, and, bohairic, preserve, e, before, etymological, or, from, lenited, t, r, j, or, tonic, syllable, coda, w, sahidic, and, bohairic, ne, ne, to, you, fem, net, nic, e, may, also, have, different, reflexes, before, sonorants, near, sibilants, and, in, diphthongs, old, a, surfaces, as, u, after, nasals, and, occasionally, other, consonants, n, r, god, na, car, nu, te, noute, u, has, acquired, phonemic, status, as, is, evidenced, by, minimal, pairs, like, to, approach, h, n, ho, n, a, nan, nn, vs, inside, houn, hu, n, a, naw, nw, an, etymological, u, e, often, surfaces, as, i, next, to, r, and, after, etymological, pharyngeals, hir, u, r, street, semitic, loan, most, coptic, dialects, have, two, phonemic, vowels, in, unstressed, position, unstressed, vowels, generally, became, written, as, e, or, null, i, in, bohairic, and, fayyumic, word, finally, but, pretonic, unstressed, a, occurs, as, a, reflex, of, earlier, unstressed, e, near, an, etymological, pharyngeal, velar, or, sonorant, to, become, many, a, ai, i, i, or, an, unstressed, a, pretonic, is, underlyingly, j, sahidic, ibis, hib, i, h, j, bj, w, hij, ba, j, w, thus, the, following, is, the, sahidic, vowel, system, c, ad, 400, earlier, egyptian, has, the, syllable, structure, cv, c, in, which, v, is, long, in, open, stressed, syllables, and, short, elsewhere, in, addition, cv, c, or, cvcc, can, occur, in, word, final, stressed, position, however, cv, c, occurs, only, in, the, infinitive, of, biconsonantal, verbal, roots, cvcc, only, in, some, plurals, in, later, egyptian, stressed, cv, c, cvcc, and, cv, become, much, more, common, because, of, the, loss, of, final, dentals, and, glides, earlier, egyptian, stresses, one, of, the, last, two, syllables, according, to, some, scholars, that, is, a, development, from, a, stage, in, proto, egyptian, in, which, the, third, last, syllable, could, be, stressed, which, was, lost, as, open, posttonic, syllables, lost, their, vowels, upiraw, upraw, transformation, as, a, convention, egyptologists, make, use, of, an, egyptological, pronunciation, in, english, the, consonants, are, given, fixed, values, and, vowels, are, inserted, according, to, essentially, arbitrary, rules, two, of, these, consonants, known, as, alef, and, ayin, are, generally, pronounced, as, the, vowel, yodh, is, pronounced, i, w, u, between, other, consonants, is, then, inserted, thus, for, example, the, egyptian, name, ramesses, is, most, accurately, transliterated, as, r, ms, sw, ra, is, the, one, who, bore, him, and, pronounced, as, r, m, ssu, in, transcription, a, i, and, u, all, represent, consonants, for, example, the, name, tutankhamun, 1341, 1323, bc, was, written, in, egyptian, as, twt, n, jmn, living, image, of, amun, experts, have, assigned, generic, sounds, to, these, values, as, a, matter, of, convenience, which, is, an, artificial, pronunciation, and, should, not, be, mistaken, for, how, egyptian, was, ever, pronounced, at, any, time, so, although, twt, n, mn, is, pronounced, t, u, t, n, k, m, n, in, modern, egyptological, pronunciation, in, his, lifetime, it, was, likely, to, be, pronounced, something, like, transliterable, as, t, w, t, n, kh, am, n, egyptian, is, fairly, typical, for, an, afroasiatic, language, in, that, most, of, its, vocabulary, is, built, around, a, root, of, three, consonants, though, there, are, sometimes, only, two, consonants, in, the, root, r, w, sun, the, is, thought, to, have, been, something, like, a, voiced, pharyngeal, fricative, larger, roots, are, also, common, and, can, have, up, to, five, consonants, s, d, d, be, upside, down, vowels, and, other, consonants, are, added, to, the, root, to, derive, different, meanings, as, arabic, hebrew, and, other, afroasiatic, languages, still, do, however, because, vowels, and, sometimes, glides, are, not, written, in, any, egyptian, script, except, coptic, it, can, be, difficult, to, reconstruct, the, actual, forms, of, words, thus, orthographic, stp, to, choose, for, example, can, represent, the, stative, whose, endings, can, be, left, unexpressed, the, imperfective, forms, or, even, a, verbal, noun, a, choosing, egyptian, nouns, can, be, masculine, or, feminine, the, latter, is, indicated, as, with, other, afroasiatic, languages, by, adding, a, t, and, singular, or, plural, w, wt, or, dual, wj, tj, articles, both, definite, and, indefinite, do, not, occur, until, late, egyptian, but, are, used, widely, thereafter, egyptian, has, three, different, types, of, personal, pronouns, suffix, enclitic, called, dependent, by, egyptologists, and, independent, pronouns, there, are, also, a, number, of, verbal, endings, added, to, the, infinitive, to, form, the, stative, and, are, regarded, by, some, linguists, as, a, fourth, set, of, personal, pronouns, they, bear, close, resemblance, to, their, semitic, counterparts, the, three, main, sets, of, personal, pronouns, are, as, follows, demonstrative, pronouns, have, separate, masculine, and, feminine, singular, forms, and, common, plural, forms, for, both, genders, finally, interrogative, pronouns, bear, a, close, resemblance, to, their, semitic, and, berber, counterparts, egyptian, verbs, have, finite, and, non, finite, forms, finite, verbs, convey, person, tense, aspect, mood, and, voice, each, is, indicated, by, a, set, of, affixal, morphemes, attached, to, the, verb, for, example, the, basic, conjugation, is, s, m, to, hear, is, s, m, f, he, hears, non, finite, verbs, occur, without, a, subject, and, are, the, infinitive, the, participles, and, the, negative, infinitive, which, egyptian, grammar, being, an, introduction, to, the, study, of, hieroglyphs, calls, negatival, complement, there, are, two, main, tenses, aspects, in, egyptian, past, and, temporally, unmarked, imperfective, and, aorist, forms, the, latter, are, determined, from, their, syntactic, context, adjectives, agree, in, gender, and, number, with, the, nouns, they, modify, z, man, nfr, good, masc, z, nfr, man, good, masc, good, man, zt, woman, nfrt, good, fem, zt, nfrt, woman, good, fem, good, woman, attributive, adjectives, in, phrases, are, after, the, nouns, they, modify, n, r, great, god, however, when, they, are, used, independently, as, a, predicate, in, an, adjectival, phrase, as, n, r, god, great, lit, great, god, adjectives, precede, the, nouns, they, modify, egyptian, makes, use, of, prepositions, adverbs, in, egyptian, are, at, the, end, of, a, sentence, for, example, z, n, went, n, r, god, m, there, z, n, n, r, m, went, god, there, god, went, there, here, are, some, common, egyptian, adverbs, old, egyptian, classical, egyptian, and, middle, egyptian, have, verb, subject, object, as, the, basic, word, order, for, example, the, equivalent, of, he, opens, the, door, would, be, wn, s, opens, he, door, the, so, called, construct, state, combines, two, or, more, nouns, to, express, the, genitive, as, in, semitic, and, berber, languages, however, that, changed, in, the, later, stages, of, the, language, including, late, egyptian, demotic, and, coptic, the, early, stages, of, egyptian, have, no, articles, but, the, later, forms, use, p, t, and, n, as, with, other, afroasiatic, languages, egyptian, uses, two, grammatical, genders, masculine, and, feminine, it, also, uses, three, grammatical, numbers, singular, dual, and, plural, however, later, egyptian, has, a, tendency, to, lose, the, dual, as, a, productive, form, the, egyptian, language, survived, through, the, middle, ages, and, into, the, early, modern, period, in, the, form, of, the, coptic, language, coptic, survived, past, the, 16th, century, only, as, an, isolated, vernacular, and, as, a, liturgical, language, for, the, coptic, orthodox, and, coptic, catholic, churches, coptic, also, had, an, enduring, effect, on, egyptian, arabic, which, replaced, coptic, as, the, main, daily, language, in, egypt, the, coptic, substratum, in, egyptian, arabic, appears, in, certain, aspects, of, syntax, and, to, a, lesser, degree, in, vocabulary, and, phonology, in, antiquity, egyptian, exerted, some, influence, on, classical, greek, so, that, a, number, of, egyptian, loanwords, into, greek, survive, into, modern, usage, examples, include, the, hebrew, bible, also, contains, some, words, terms, and, names, that, are, thought, by, scholars, to, be, egyptian, in, origin, an, example, of, this, is, zaphnath, paaneah, the, egyptian, name, given, to, joseph, the, etymological, root, of, egypt, is, the, same, as, copts, ultimately, from, the, late, egyptian, name, of, memphis, hikuptah, a, continuation, of, middle, egyptian, wt, k, pt, lit, temple, of, the, ka, soul, of, ptah, important, note, the, old, grammars, and, dictionaries, of, e, a, wallis, budge, have, long, been, considered, obsolete, by, egyptologists, even, though, these, books, are, still, available, for, purchase, more, book, information, is, available, at, glyphs, and, grammars
