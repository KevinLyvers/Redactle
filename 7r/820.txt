and, intentions, when, he, talked, about, his, nonviolent, approaches, to, conflict, according, to, gandhi, s, autobiography, the, contest, winner, was, maganlal, gandhi, presumably, no, relation, who, submitted, the, entry, sadagraha, which, gandhi, then, modified, to, satyagraha, etymologically, this, hindic, word, means, truth, firmness, and, is, commonly, translated, as, steadfastness, in, the, truth, or, truth, force, satyagraha, theory, also, influenced, martin, luther, king, jr, james, bevel, and, others, during, the, campaigns, they, led, during, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, united, states, the, theory, of, satyagraha, sees, means, and, ends, as, inseparable, therefore, it, is, contradictory, to, try, to, use, violence, to, obtain, peace, as, gandhi, wrote, they, say, means, are, after, all, means, i, would, say, means, are, after, all, everything, as, the, means, so, the, end, a, quote, sometimes, attributed, to, gandhi, but, also, to, a, j, muste, sums, it, up, there, is, no, way, to, peace, peace, is, the, way, the, following, are, monuments, to, peace, many, different, theories, of, peace, exist, in, the, world, of, peace, studies, which, involves, the, study, of, de, escalation, conflict, transformation, disarmament, and, cessation, of, violence, the, definition, of, peace, can, vary, with, religion, culture, or, subject, of, study, the, classical, realist, position, is, that, the, key, to, promoting, order, between, states, and, so, of, increasing, the, chances, of, peace, is, the, maintenance, of, a, balance, of, power, between, states, a, situation, where, no, state, is, so, dominant, that, it, can, lay, down, the, law, to, the, rest, exponents, of, this, view, have, included, metternich, bismarck, hans, morgenthau, and, henry, kissinger, a, related, approach, more, in, the, tradition, of, hugo, grotius, than, thomas, hobbes, was, articulated, by, the, so, called, english, school, of, international, relations, theory, such, as, martin, wight, in, his, book, power, politics, 1946, 1978, and, hedley, bull, in, the, anarchical, society, 1977, as, the, maintenance, of, a, balance, of, power, could, in, some, circumstances, require, a, willingness, to, go, to, war, some, critics, saw, the, idea, of, a, balance, of, power, as, promoting, war, rather, than, promoting, peace, this, was, a, radical, critique, of, those, supporters, of, the, allied, and, associated, powers, who, justified, entry, into, world, war, i, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, necessary, to, preserve, the, balance, of, power, in, europe, from, a, german, bid, for, hegemony, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, especially, during, the, cold, war, a, particular, form, of, balance, of, power, mutual, nuclear, deterrence, emerged, as, a, widely, held, doctrine, on, the, key, to, peace, between, the, great, powers, critics, argued, that, the, development, of, nuclear, stockpiles, increased, the, chances, of, war, rather, than, peace, and, that, the, nuclear, umbrella, made, it, safe, for, smaller, wars, e, g, the, vietnam, war, and, the, soviet, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, to, end, the, prague, spring, so, making, such, wars, more, likely, appeasement, is, a, strategy, to, achieve, peace, by, making, political, material, or, territorial, concessions, to, an, aggressive, power, deterrence, is, a, strategy, to, achieve, peace, by, using, threats, or, limited, force, to, dissuade, an, actor, from, escalating, conflict, typically, because, the, prospective, attacker, believes, that, the, probability, of, success, is, low, and, the, costs, of, attack, are, high, speaking, truth, to, power, is, a, non, violent, political, tactic, employed, by, dissidents, against, the, received, wisdom, or, propaganda, of, governments, they, regard, as, oppressive, authoritarian, or, an, ideocracy, practitioners, who, have, campaigned, for, a, more, just, and, truthful, world, have, included, apollonius, of, tyana, vaclav, havel, nelson, mandela, archbishop, desmond, tutu, mahatma, gandhi, bacha, khan, and, the, dalai, lama, the, phrase, originated, with, a, pamphlet, speak, truth, to, power, a, quaker, search, for, an, alternative, to, violence, published, by, the, american, friends, service, committee, in, 1955, a, contributor, of, the, pamphlet, s, contents, was, civil, rights, activist, bayard, rustin, it, was, a, central, tenet, of, classical, liberalism, for, example, among, english, liberal, thinkers, of, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, that, free, trade, promoted, peace, for, example, the, cambridge, economist, john, maynard, keynes, 1883, 1946, said, that, he, was, brought, up, on, this, idea, and, held, it, unquestioned, until, at, least, the, 1920s, during, the, economic, globalization, in, the, decades, leading, up, to, world, war, i, writers, such, as, norman, angell, argued, that, the, growth, of, economic, interdependence, between, the, great, powers, made, war, between, them, futile, and, therefore, unlikely, he, made, this, argument, in, 1913, a, year, later, europe, s, economically, interconnected, states, were, embroiled, in, what, would, later, become, known, as, the, first, world, war, the, democratic, peace, theory, posits, that, democracy, causes, peace, between, democracies, because, of, the, accountability, institutions, values, and, norms, of, democratic, countries, the, territorial, peace, theory, posits, that, peace, causes, democracy, because, territorial, wars, between, neighbor, countries, lead, to, authoritarian, attitudes, and, disregard, for, democratic, values, this, theory, is, supported, by, historical, studies, showing, that, countries, rarely, become, democratic, until, after, their, borders, have, been, settled, by, territorial, peace, with, neighbor, countries, the, peace, and, war, game, is, an, approach, in, game, theory, to, understand, the, relationship, between, peace, and, conflicts, the, iterated, game, hypotheses, was, originally, used, by, academic, groups, and, computer, simulations, to, study, possible, strategies, of, cooperation, and, aggression, as, peace, makers, became, richer, over, time, it, became, clear, that, making, war, had, greater, costs, than, initially, anticipated, one, of, the, well, studied, strategies, that, acquired, wealth, more, rapidly, was, based, on, genghis, khan, i, e, a, constant, aggressor, making, war, continually, to, gain, resources, this, led, in, contrast, to, the, development, of, what, s, known, as, the, provokable, nice, guy, strategy, a, peace, maker, until, attacked, improved, upon, merely, to, win, by, occasional, forgiveness, even, when, attacked, by, adding, the, results, of, all, pairwise, games, for, each, player, one, sees, that, multiple, players, gain, wealth, cooperating, with, each, other, while, bleeding, a, constantly, aggressive, player, socialist, communist, and, left, wing, liberal, writers, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, e, g, lenin, j, a, hobson, john, strachey, argued, that, capitalism, caused, war, e, g, through, promoting, imperial, or, other, economic, rivalries, that, lead, to, international, conflict, this, led, some, to, argue, that, international, socialism, was, the, key, to, peace, however, in, response, to, such, writers, in, the, 1930s, who, argued, that, capitalism, caused, war, the, economist, john, maynard, keynes, 1883, 1946, argued, that, managed, capitalism, could, promote, peace, this, involved, international, coordination, of, fiscal, monetary, policies, an, international, monetary, system, that, did, not, pit, the, interests, of, countries, against, each, other, and, a, high, degree, of, freedom, of, trade, these, ideas, underlay, keynes, s, work, during, world, war, ii, that, led, to, the, creation, of, the, international, monetary, fund, and, the, world, bank, at, bretton, woods, in, 1944, and, later, of, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, subsequently, the, world, trade, organization, one, of, the, most, influential, theories, of, peace, especially, since, woodrow, wilson, led, the, creation, of, the, league, of, nations, at, the, paris, peace, conference, of, 1919, is, that, peace, will, be, advanced, if, the, intentional, anarchy, of, states, is, replaced, through, the, growth, of, international, law, promoted, and, enforced, through, international, organizations, such, as, the, league, of, nations, the, united, nations, and, other, functional, international, organizations, one, of, the, most, important, early, exponents, of, this, view, was, alfred, eckhart, zimmern, for, example, in, his, 1936, book, the, league, of, nations, and, the, rule, of, law, many, idealist, thinkers, about, international, relations, e, g, in, the, traditions, of, kant, and, karl, marx, have, argued, that, the, key, to, peace, is, the, growth, of, some, form, of, solidarity, between, peoples, or, classes, of, people, spanning, the, lines, of, cleavage, between, nations, or, states, that, lead, to, war, one, version, of, this, is, the, idea, of, promoting, international, understanding, between, nations, through, the, international, mobility, of, students, an, idea, most, powerfully, advanced, by, cecil, rhodes, in, the, creation, of, the, rhodes, scholarships, and, his, successors, such, as, j, william, fulbright, another, theory, is, that, peace, can, be, developed, among, countries, on, the, basis, of, active, management, of, water, resources, world, peace, day, celebrated, on, 21, september, was, founded, as, a, day, to, recognize, honour, and, promote, peace, it, is, commemorated, each, year, by, united, nations, members, peace, and, conflict, studies, is, an, academic, field, which, identifies, and, analyses, violent, and, nonviolent, behaviours, as, well, as, the, structural, mechanisms, attending, violent, and, non, violent, social, conflicts, this, is, to, better, understand, the, processes, leading, to, a, more, desirable, human, condition, one, variation, peace, studies, irenology, is, an, interdisciplinary, effort, aiming, at, the, prevention, de, escalation, and, solution, of, conflicts, this, contrasts, with, war, studies, polemology, directed, at, the, efficient, attainment, of, victory, in, conflicts, disciplines, involved, may, include, political, science, geography, economics, psychology, sociology, international, relations, history, anthropology, religious, studies, and, gender, studies, as, well, as, a, variety, of, other, disciplines, although, peace, is, widely, perceived, as, something, intangible, various, organizations, have, been, making, efforts, to, quantify, and, measure, it, the, global, peace, index, produced, by, the, institute, for, economics, and, peace, is, a, known, effort, to, evaluate, peacefulness, in, countries, based, on, 23, indicators, of, the, absence, of, violence, and, absence, of, the, fear, of, violence, the, 2015, edition, of, the, index, ranked, 163, countries, on, their, internal, and, external, levels, of, peace, according, to, the, 2017, global, peace, index, iceland, is, the, most, peaceful, country, in, the, world, while, syria, is, the, least, peaceful, one, fragile, states, index, formerly, known, as, the, failed, states, index, created, by, the, fund, for, peace, focuses, on, risk, for, instability, or, violence, in, 178, nations, this, index, measures, how, fragile, a, state, is, by, 12, indicators, and, subindicators, that, evaluate, aspects, of, politics, social, economy, and, military, facets, in, countries, the, 2015, failed, state, index, reports, that, the, most, fragile, nation, is, south, sudan, and, the, least, fragile, one, is, finland, university, of, maryland, publishes, the, peace, and, conflict, instability, ledger, in, order, to, measure, peace, it, grades, 163, countries, with, 5, indicators, and, pays, the, most, attention, to, risk, of, political, instability, or, armed, conflict, over, a, three, year, period, the, most, recent, ledger, shows, that, the, most, peaceful, country, is, slovenia, on, the, contrary, afghanistan, is, the, most, conflicted, nation, besides, indicated, above, reports, from, the, institute, for, economics, and, peace, fund, for, peace, and, university, of, maryland, other, organizations, including, george, mason, university, release, indexes, that, rank, countries, in, terms, of, peacefulness, the, longest, continuing, period, of, peace, and, neutrality, among, currently, existing, states, is, observed, in, sweden, since, 1814, and, in, switzerland, which, has, had, an, official, policy, of, neutrality, since, 1815, this, was, made, possible, partly, by, the, periods, of, relative, peace, in, europe, and, the, world, known, as, pax, britannica, 1815, 1914, pax, europaea, pax, americana, since, 1950s, and, pax, atomica, also, since, the, 1950s, other,
