manufacturing, is, the, creation, or, production, of, goods, with, the, help, of, equipment, labor, machines, tools, and, chemical, or, biological, processing, or, formulation, it, is, the, essence, of, the, secondary, sector, of, the, economy, the, term, may, refer, to, a, range, of, human, activity, from, handicraft, to, high, tech, but, it, is, most, commonly, applied, to, industrial, design, in, which, raw, materials, from, the, primary, sector, are, transformed, into, finished, goods, on, a, large, scale, such, goods, may, be, sold, to, other, manufacturers, for, the, production, of, other, more, complex, products, such, as, aircraft, household, appliances, furniture, sports, equipment, or, automobiles, or, distributed, via, the, tertiary, industry, to, end, users, and, consumers, usually, through, wholesalers, who, in, turn, sell, to, retailers, who, then, sell, them, to, individual, customers, manufacturing, engineering, is, the, field, of, engineering, that, designs, and, optimizes, the, manufacturing, process, or, the, steps, through, which, raw, materials, are, transformed, into, a, final, product, the, manufacturing, process, begins, with, the, product, design, and, materials, specification, these, materials, are, then, modified, through, manufacturing, to, become, the, desired, product, contemporary, manufacturing, encompasses, all, intermediary, stages, involved, in, producing, and, integrating, components, of, a, product, some, industries, such, as, semiconductor, and, steel, manufacturers, use, the, term, fabrication, instead, the, manufacturing, sector, is, closely, connected, with, the, engineering, and, industrial, design, industries, the, modern, english, word, manufacture, is, likely, derived, from, the, middle, french, manufacture, process, of, making, which, itself, originates, from, the, classical, latin, man, hand, and, middle, french, facture, making, alternatively, the, english, word, may, have, been, independently, formed, from, the, earlier, english, manufacture, made, by, human, hands, and, fracture, its, earliest, usage, in, the, english, language, was, recorded, in, the, mid, 16th, century, to, refer, to, the, making, of, products, by, hand, human, ancestors, manufactured, objects, using, stone, and, other, tools, long, before, the, emergence, of, homo, sapiens, about, 200, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, methods, of, stone, tool, making, known, as, the, oldowan, industry, date, back, to, at, least, 2, 3, million, years, ago, with, the, earliest, direct, evidence, of, tool, usage, found, in, ethiopia, within, the, great, rift, valley, dating, back, to, 2, 5, million, years, ago, to, manufacture, a, stone, tool, a, core, of, hard, stone, with, specific, flaking, properties, such, as, flint, was, struck, with, a, hammerstone, this, flaking, produced, sharp, edges, that, could, be, used, as, tools, primarily, in, the, form, of, choppers, or, scrapers, these, tools, greatly, aided, the, early, humans, in, their, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, to, form, other, tools, out, of, softer, materials, such, as, bone, and, wood, the, middle, paleolithic, approximately, 300, 000, years, ago, saw, the, introduction, of, the, prepared, core, technique, where, multiple, blades, could, be, rapidly, formed, from, a, single, core, stone, pressure, flaking, in, which, a, wood, bone, or, antler, punch, could, be, used, to, shape, a, stone, very, finely, was, developed, during, the, upper, paleolithic, beginning, approximately, 40, 000, years, ago, during, the, neolithic, period, polished, stone, tools, were, manufactured, from, a, variety, of, hard, rocks, such, as, flint, jade, jadeite, and, greenstone, the, polished, axes, were, used, alongside, other, stone, tools, including, projectiles, knives, and, scrapers, as, well, as, tools, manufactured, from, organic, materials, such, as, wood, bone, and, antler, copper, smelting, is, believed, to, have, originated, when, the, technology, of, pottery, kiln, allowed, sufficiently, high, temperatures, the, concentration, of, various, elements, such, as, arsenic, increase, with, depth, in, copper, ore, deposits, and, smelting, of, these, ores, yields, arsenical, bronze, which, can, be, sufficiently, work, hardened, to, be, suitable, for, manufacturing, tools, bronze, is, an, alloy, of, copper, with, tin, the, latter, of, which, being, found, in, relatively, few, deposits, globally, delayed, true, tin, bronze, becoming, widespread, during, the, bronze, age, bronze, was, a, major, improvement, over, stone, as, a, material, for, making, tools, both, because, of, its, mechanical, properties, like, strength, and, ductility, and, because, it, could, be, cast, in, molds, to, make, intricately, shaped, objects, bronze, significantly, advanced, shipbuilding, technology, with, better, tools, and, bronze, nails, which, replaced, the, old, method, of, attaching, boards, of, the, hull, with, cord, woven, through, drilled, holes, the, iron, age, is, conventionally, defined, by, the, widespread, manufacturing, of, weapons, and, tools, using, iron, and, steel, rather, than, bronze, iron, smelting, is, more, difficult, than, tin, and, copper, smelting, because, smelted, iron, requires, hot, working, and, can, be, melted, only, in, specially, designed, furnaces, the, place, and, time, for, the, discovery, of, iron, smelting, is, not, known, partly, because, of, the, difficulty, of, distinguishing, metal, extracted, from, nickel, containing, ores, from, hot, worked, meteoritic, iron, during, the, growth, of, the, ancient, civilizations, many, ancient, technologies, resulted, from, advances, in, manufacturing, several, of, the, six, classic, simple, machines, were, invented, in, mesopotamia, mesopotamians, have, been, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, wheel, the, wheel, and, axle, mechanism, first, appeared, with, the, potter, s, wheel, invented, in, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, during, the, 5th, millennium, bc, egyptian, paper, made, from, papyrus, as, well, as, pottery, were, mass, produced, and, exported, throughout, the, mediterranean, basin, early, construction, techniques, used, by, the, ancient, egyptians, made, use, of, bricks, composed, mainly, of, clay, sand, silt, and, other, minerals, the, middle, ages, witnessed, new, inventions, innovations, in, the, ways, of, managing, traditional, means, of, production, and, economic, growth, papermaking, a, 2nd, century, chinese, technology, was, carried, to, the, middle, east, when, a, group, of, chinese, papermakers, were, captured, in, the, 8th, century, papermaking, technology, was, spread, to, europe, by, the, umayyad, conquest, of, hispania, a, paper, mill, was, established, in, sicily, in, the, 12th, century, in, europe, the, fiber, to, make, pulp, for, making, paper, was, obtained, from, linen, and, cotton, rags, lynn, townsend, white, jr, credited, the, spinning, wheel, with, increasing, the, supply, of, rags, which, led, to, cheap, paper, which, was, a, factor, in, the, development, of, printing, due, to, the, casting, of, cannon, the, blast, furnace, came, into, widespread, use, in, france, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, blast, furnace, had, been, used, in, china, since, the, 4th, century, bc, the, stocking, frame, which, was, invented, in, 1598, increased, a, knitter, s, number, of, knots, per, minute, from, 100, to, 1000, the, industrial, revolution, was, the, transition, to, new, manufacturing, processes, in, europe, and, the, united, states, from, 1760, to, the, 1830s, this, transition, included, going, from, hand, production, methods, to, machines, new, chemical, manufacturing, and, iron, production, processes, the, increasing, use, of, steam, power, and, water, power, the, development, of, machine, tools, and, the, rise, of, the, mechanized, factory, system, the, industrial, revolution, also, led, to, an, unprecedented, rise, in, the, rate, of, population, growth, textiles, were, the, dominant, industry, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, terms, of, employment, value, of, output, and, capital, invested, the, textile, industry, was, also, the, first, to, use, modern, production, methods, 40, rapid, industrialization, first, began, in, britain, starting, with, mechanized, spinning, in, the, 1780s, with, high, rates, of, growth, in, steam, power, and, iron, production, occurring, after, 1800, mechanized, textile, production, spread, from, great, britain, to, continental, europe, and, the, united, states, in, the, early, 19th, century, with, important, centres, of, textiles, iron, and, coal, emerging, in, belgium, and, the, united, states, and, later, textiles, in, france, an, economic, recession, occurred, from, the, late, 1830s, to, the, early, 1840s, when, the, adoption, of, the, industrial, revolution, s, early, innovations, such, as, mechanized, spinning, and, weaving, slowed, down, and, their, markets, matured, innovations, developed, late, in, the, period, such, as, the, increasing, adoption, of, locomotives, steamboats, and, steamships, hot, blast, iron, smelting, and, new, technologies, such, as, the, electrical, telegraph, were, widely, introduced, in, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, were, not, powerful, enough, to, drive, high, rates, of, growth, rapid, economic, growth, began, to, occur, after, 1870, springing, from, a, new, group, of, innovations, in, what, has, been, called, the, second, industrial, revolution, these, innovations, included, new, steel, making, processes, mass, production, assembly, lines, electrical, grid, systems, the, large, scale, manufacture, of, machine, tools, and, the, use, of, increasingly, advanced, machinery, in, steam, powered, factories, building, on, improvements, in, vacuum, pumps, and, materials, research, incandescent, light, bulbs, became, practical, for, general, use, in, the, late, 1870s, this, invention, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, workplace, because, factories, could, now, have, second, and, third, shift, workers, shoe, production, was, mechanized, during, the, mid, 19th, century, mass, production, of, sewing, machines, and, agricultural, machinery, such, as, reapers, occurred, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, the, mass, production, of, bicycles, started, in, the, 1880s, steam, powered, factories, became, widespread, although, the, conversion, from, water, power, to, steam, occurred, in, england, earlier, than, in, the, u, s, electrification, of, factories, which, had, begun, gradually, in, the, 1890s, after, the, introduction, of, the, practical, dc, motor, and, the, ac, motor, was, fastest, between, 1900, and, 1930, this, was, aided, by, the, establishment, of, electric, utilities, with, central, stations, and, the, lowering, of, electricity, prices, from, 1914, to, 1917, electric, motors, allowed, more, flexibility, in, manufacturing, and, required, less, maintenance, than, line, shafts, and, belts, many, factories, witnessed, a, 30, increase, in, output, owing, to, the, increasing, shift, to, electric, motors, electrification, enabled, modern, mass, production, and, the, biggest, impact, of, early, mass, production, was, in, the, manufacturing, of, everyday, items, such, as, at, the, ball, brothers, glass, manufacturing, company, which, electrified, its, mason, jar, plant, in, muncie, indiana, u, s, around, 1900, the, new, automated, process, used, glass, blowing, machines, to, replace, 210, craftsman, glass, blowers, and, helpers, a, small, electric, truck, was, now, used, to, handle, 150, dozen, bottles, at, a, time, whereas, previously, used, hand, trucks, could, only, carry, 6, dozen, bottles, at, a, time, electric, mixers, replaced, men, with, shovels, handling, sand, and, other, ingredients, that, were, fed, into, the, glass, furnace, an, electric, overhead, crane, replaced, 36, day, laborers, for, moving, heavy, loads, across, the, factory, mass, production, was, popularized, in, the, late, 1910s, and, 1920s, by, henry, ford, s, ford, motor, company, which, introduced, electric, motors, to, the, then, well, known, technique, of, chain, or, sequential, production, ford, also, bought, or, designed, and, built, special, purpose, machine, tools, and, fixtures, such, as, multiple, spindle, drill, presses, that, could, drill, every, hole, on, one, side, of, an, engine, block, in, one, operation, and, a, multiple, head, milling, machine, that, could, simultaneously, machine, 15, engine, blocks, held, on, a, single, fixture, all, of, these, machine, tools, were, arranged, systematically, in, the, production, flow, and, some, had, special, carriages, for, rolling, heavy, items, into, machining, positions, production, of, the, ford, model, t, used, 32, 000, machine, tools, lean, manufacturing, also, known, as, just, in, time, manufacturing, was, developed, in, japan, in, the, 1930s, it, is, a, production, method, aimed, primarily, at, reducing, times, within, the, production, system, as, well, as, response, times, from, suppliers, and, to, customers, it, was, introduced, in, australia, in, the, 1950s, by, the, british, motor, corporation, australia, at, its, victoria, park, plant, in, sydney, from, where, the, idea, later, migrated, to, toyota, news, spread, to, western, countries, from, japan, in, 1977, in, two, english, language, articles, one, referred, to, the, methodology, as, the, ohno, system, after, taiichi, ohno, who, was, instrumental, in, its, development, within, toyota, the, other, article, by, toyota, authors, in, an, international, journal, provided, additional, details, finally, those, and, other, publicity, were, translated, into, implementations, beginning, in, 1980, and, then, quickly, multiplying, throughout, the, industry, in, the, united, states, and, other, countries, according, to, a, traditional, view, of, manufacturing, strategy, there, are, five, key, dimensions, along, which, the, performance, of, manufacturing, can, be, assessed, cost, quality, dependability, flexibility, and, innovation, in, regard, to, manufacturing, performance, wickham, skinner, who, has, been, called, the, father, of, manufacturing, strategy, adopted, the, concept, of, focus, with, an, implication, that, a, business, cannot, perform, at, the, highest, level, along, all, five, dimensions, and, must, therefore, select, one, or, two, competitive, priorities, this, view, led, to, the, theory, of, trade, offs, in, manufacturing, strategy, similarly, elizabeth, haas, wrote, in, 1987, about, the, delivery, of, value, in, manufacturing, for, customers, in, terms, of, lower, prices, greater, service, responsiveness, or, higher, quality, the, theory, of, trade, offs, has, subsequently, being, debated, and, questioned, but, skinner, wrote, in, 1992, that, at, that, time, enthusiasm, for, the, concepts, of, manufacturing, strategy, been, higher, noting, that, in, academic, papers, executive, courses, and, case, studies, levels, of, interest, were, bursting, out, all, over, manufacturing, writer, terry, hill, has, commented, that, manufacturing, is, often, seen, as, a, less, strategic, business, activity, than, functions, such, as, marketing, and, finance, and, that, manufacturing, managers, have, come, late, to, business, strategy, making, discussions, where, as, a, result, they, make, only, a, reactive, contribution, emerging, technologies, have, offered, new, growth, methods, in, advanced, manufacturing, employment, opportunities, for, example, in, the, manufacturing, belt, in, the, united, states, manufacturing, provides, important, material, support, for, national, infrastructure, and, also, for, national, defense, on, the, other, hand, most, manufacturing, processes, may, involve, significant, social, and, environmental, costs, the, clean, up, costs, of, hazardous, waste, for, example, may, outweigh, the, benefits, of, a, product, that, creates, it, hazardous, materials, may, expose, workers, to, health, risks, these, costs, are, now, well, known, and, there, is, effort, to, address, them, by, improving, efficiency, reducing, waste, using, industrial, symbiosis, and, eliminating, harmful, chemicals, the, negative, costs, of, manufacturing, can, also, be, addressed, legally, developed, countries, regulate, manufacturing, activity, with, labor, laws, and, environmental, laws, across, the, globe, manufacturers, can, be, subject, to, regulations, and, pollution, taxes, to, offset, the, environmental, costs, of, manufacturing, activities, labor, unions, and, craft, guilds, have, played, a, historic, role, in, the, negotiation, of, worker, rights, and, wages, environment, laws, and, labor, protections, that, are, available, in, developed, nations, may, not, be, available, in, the, third, world, tort, law, and, product, liability, impose, additional, costs, on, manufacturing, these, are, significant, dynamics, in, the, ongoing, process, occurring, over, the, last, few, decades, of, manufacture, based, industries, relocating, operations, to, developing, world, economies, where, the, costs, of, production, are, significantly, lower, than, in, developed, world, economies, from, a, financial, perspective, the, goal, of, the, manufacturing, industry, is, mainly, to, achieve, cost, benefits, per, unit, produced, which, in, turn, leads, to, cost, reductions, in, product, prices, for, the, market, towards, end, customers, this, relative, cost, reduction, towards, the, market, is, how, manufacturing, firms, secure, their, profit, margins, manufacturing, has, unique, health, and, safety, challenges, and, has, been, recognized, by, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, as, a, priority, industry, sector, in, the, national, occupational, research, agenda, nora, to, identify, and, provide, intervention, strategies, regarding, occupational, health, and, safety, issues, surveys, and, analyses, of, trends, and, issues, in, manufacturing, and, investment, around, the, world, focus, on, such, things, as, in, addition, to, general, overviews, researchers, have, examined, the, features, and, factors, affecting, particular, key, aspects, of, manufacturing, development, they, have, compared, production, and, investment, in, a, range, of, western, and, non, western, countries, and, presented, case, studies, of, growth, and, performance, in, important, individual, industries, and, market, economic, sectors, on, june, 26, 2009, jeff, immelt, the, ceo, of, general, electric, called, for, the, united, states, to, increase, its, manufacturing, base, employment, to, 20, of, the, workforce, commenting, that, the, u, s, has, outsourced, too, much, in, some, areas, and, can, no, longer, rely, on, the, financial, sector, and, consumer, spending, to, drive, demand, further, while, u, s, manufacturing, performs, well, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, u, s, economy, research, shows, that, it, performs, poorly, compared, to, manufacturing, in, other, high, wage, countries, a, total, of, 3, 2, million, one, in, six, u, s, manufacturing, jobs, have, disappeared, between, 2000, and, 2007, in, the, uk, eef, the, manufacturers, organisation, has, led, calls, for, the, uk, economy, to, be, rebalanced, to, rely, less, on, financial, services, and, has, actively, promoted, the, manufacturing, agenda, according, to, the, united, nations, industrial, development, organization, unido, china, is, the, top, manufacturer, worldwide, by, 2019, output, producing, 28, 7, of, the, total, global, manufacturing, output, followed, by, the, united, states, of, america, japan, germany, and, india, unido, also, publishes, a, competitive, industrial, performance, cip, index, which, measures, the, competitive, manufacturing, ability, of, different, nations, the, cip, index, combines, a, nation, s, gross, manufacturing, output, with, other, factors, like, high, tech, capability, and, the, nation, s, impact, on, the, world, economy, germany, topped, the, 2020, cip, index, followed, by, china, south, korea, the, united, states, and, japan, these, are, the, top, 50, countries, by, total, value, of, manufacturing, output, in, u, s, dollars, for, its, noted, year, according, to, world, bank
