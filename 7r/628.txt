international, relations, ir, are, the, interactions, among, sovereign, states, the, scientific, study, of, those, interactions, is, also, referred, to, as, international, studies, international, politics, or, international, affairs, in, a, broader, sense, the, study, of, ir, in, addition, to, multilateral, relations, concerns, all, activities, among, states, such, as, war, diplomacy, trade, and, foreign, policy, as, well, as, relations, with, and, among, other, international, actors, such, as, intergovernmental, organizations, igos, international, nongovernmental, organizations, ingos, international, legal, bodies, and, multinational, corporations, mncs, international, relations, is, generally, classified, as, a, major, subdiscipline, of, political, science, along, with, comparative, politics, political, methodology, political, theory, and, public, administration, it, often, draws, heavily, from, other, fields, including, anthropology, economics, geography, history, law, philosophy, and, sociology, there, are, several, schools, of, thought, within, ir, of, which, the, most, prominent, are, realism, liberalism, and, constructivism, while, international, politics, has, been, analyzed, since, antiquity, it, did, not, become, a, discrete, field, until, 1919, when, it, was, first, offered, as, an, undergraduate, major, by, aberystwyth, university, in, the, united, kingdom, the, second, world, war, and, its, aftermath, provoked, greater, interest, and, scholarship, in, international, relations, particularly, in, north, america, and, western, europe, where, it, was, shaped, considerably, by, the, geostrategic, concerns, of, the, cold, war, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, and, subsequent, rise, of, globalization, in, the, late, 20th, century, have, presaged, new, theories, and, evaluations, of, the, rapidly, changing, international, system, depending, on, the, academic, institution, international, relations, or, international, affairs, is, either, a, subdiscipline, of, political, science, or, a, broader, multidisciplinary, field, encompassing, global, politics, law, economics, or, world, history, as, a, subdiscipline, of, political, science, the, focus, of, ir, studies, lies, on, political, diplomatic, and, security, connections, among, states, as, well, as, the, study, of, modern, political, world, history, in, many, academic, institutions, studies, of, ir, are, thus, situated, in, the, department, of, politics, social, sciences, this, is, for, example, the, case, in, scandinavia, where, international, relations, are, often, simply, referred, to, as, international, politics, ip, in, institutions, where, international, relations, refers, to, the, broader, multidisciplinary, field, of, global, politics, law, economics, and, history, the, subject, may, be, studied, across, multiple, departments, or, be, situated, in, its, own, department, as, is, the, case, at, for, example, the, london, school, of, economics, an, undergraduate, degree, in, multidisciplinary, international, relations, may, lead, to, a, more, specialised, master, s, degree, of, either, international, politics, economics, or, international, law, in, the, inaugural, issue, of, world, politics, frederick, s, dunn, wrote, that, ir, was, about, relations, that, take, place, across, national, boundaries, and, between, autonomous, political, groups, in, a, world, system, dunn, wrote, that, unique, elements, characterized, ir, and, separated, it, from, other, subfields, international, politics, is, concerned, with, the, special, kind, of, power, relationships, that, exist, in, a, community, lacking, an, overriding, authority, international, economics, deals, with, trade, relations, across, national, boundaries, that, are, complicated, by, the, uncontrolled, actions, of, sovereign, states, and, international, law, is, law, that, is, based, on, voluntary, acceptance, by, independent, nations, the, terms, international, studies, and, global, studies, have, been, used, by, some, to, refer, to, a, broader, multidisciplinary, ir, field, studies, of, international, relations, started, thousands, of, years, ago, barry, buzan, and, richard, little, considered, the, interaction, of, ancient, sumerian, city, states, starting, in, 3, 500, bc, as, the, first, fully, fledged, international, system, analyses, of, the, foreign, policies, of, sovereign, city, states, have, been, done, in, ancient, times, as, in, thycydides, analysis, of, the, causes, of, the, peloponnesian, war, between, athens, and, sparta, as, well, as, by, niccol, machiavelli, in, the, prince, published, in, 1532, where, he, analyzed, the, foreign, policy, of, the, renaissance, city, state, of, florence, the, contemporary, field, of, international, relations, however, analyzes, the, connections, existing, between, sovereign, nation, states, this, makes, the, establishment, of, the, modern, state, system, the, natural, starting, point, of, international, relations, history, the, establishment, of, modern, sovereign, states, as, fundamental, political, units, traces, back, to, the, peace, of, westphalia, of, 1648, in, europe, during, the, preceding, middle, ages, european, organization, of, political, authority, was, based, on, a, vaguely, hierarchical, religious, order, contrary, to, popular, belief, westphalia, still, embodied, layered, systems, of, sovereignty, especially, within, the, holy, roman, empire, more, than, the, peace, of, westphalia, the, treaty, of, utrecht, of, 1713, is, thought, to, reflect, an, emerging, norm, that, sovereigns, had, no, internal, equals, within, a, defined, territory, and, no, external, superiors, as, the, ultimate, authority, within, the, territory, s, sovereign, borders, these, principles, underpin, the, modern, international, legal, and, political, order, the, period, between, roughly, 1500, to, 1789, saw, the, rise, of, independent, sovereign, states, multilateralism, and, the, institutionalization, of, diplomacy, and, the, military, the, french, revolution, contributed, the, idea, that, the, citizenry, of, a, state, defined, as, the, nation, that, were, sovereign, rather, than, a, monarch, or, noble, class, a, state, wherein, the, nation, is, sovereign, would, thence, be, termed, a, nation, state, as, opposed, to, a, monarchy, or, a, religious, state, the, term, republic, increasingly, became, its, synonym, an, alternative, model, of, the, nation, state, was, developed, in, reaction, to, the, french, republican, concept, by, the, germans, and, others, who, instead, of, giving, the, citizenry, sovereignty, kept, the, princes, and, nobility, but, defined, nation, statehood, in, ethnic, linguistic, terms, establishing, the, rarely, if, ever, fulfilled, ideal, that, all, people, speaking, one, language, should, belong, to, one, state, only, the, same, claim, to, sovereignty, was, made, for, both, forms, of, nation, state, in, europe, today, few, states, conform, to, either, definition, of, nation, state, many, continue, to, have, royal, sovereigns, and, hardly, any, are, ethnically, homogeneous, the, particular, european, system, supposing, the, sovereign, equality, of, states, was, exported, to, the, americas, africa, and, asia, via, colonialism, and, the, standards, of, civilization, the, contemporary, international, system, was, finally, established, through, decolonization, during, the, cold, war, however, this, is, somewhat, over, simplified, while, the, nation, state, system, is, considered, modern, many, states, have, not, incorporated, the, system, and, are, termed, pre, modern, a, handful, of, states, have, moved, beyond, insistence, on, full, sovereignty, and, can, be, considered, post, modern, the, ability, of, contemporary, ir, discourse, to, explain, the, relations, of, these, different, types, of, states, is, disputed, levels, of, analysis, is, a, way, of, looking, at, the, international, system, which, includes, the, individual, level, the, domestic, state, as, a, unit, the, international, level, of, transnational, and, intergovernmental, affairs, and, the, global, level, what, is, explicitly, recognized, as, international, relations, theory, was, not, developed, until, after, world, war, i, and, is, dealt, with, in, more, detail, below, ir, theory, however, has, a, long, tradition, of, drawing, on, the, work, of, other, social, sciences, the, use, of, capitalizations, of, the, i, and, r, in, international, relations, aims, to, distinguish, the, academic, discipline, of, international, relations, from, the, phenomena, of, international, relations, many, cite, sun, tzu, s, the, art, of, war, 6th, century, bc, thucydides, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, 5th, century, bc, chanakya, s, arthashastra, 4th, century, bc, as, the, inspiration, for, realist, theory, with, hobbes, leviathan, and, machiavelli, s, the, prince, providing, further, elaboration, similarly, liberalism, draws, upon, the, work, of, kant, and, rousseau, with, the, work, of, the, former, often, being, cited, as, the, first, elaboration, of, democratic, peace, theory, though, contemporary, human, rights, is, considerably, different, from, the, type, of, rights, envisioned, under, natural, law, francisco, de, vitoria, hugo, grotius, and, john, locke, offered, the, first, accounts, of, universal, entitlement, to, certain, rights, on, the, basis, of, common, humanity, in, the, 20th, century, in, addition, to, contemporary, theories, of, liberal, internationalism, marxism, has, been, a, foundation, of, international, relations, international, relations, as, a, distinct, field, of, study, began, in, britain, ir, emerged, as, a, formal, academic, discipline, in, 1919, with, the, founding, of, the, first, ir, professorship, the, woodrow, wilson, chair, at, aberystwyth, university, of, wales, now, aberystwyth, university, held, by, alfred, eckhard, zimmern, and, endowed, by, david, davies, international, politics, courses, were, established, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, in, 1899, by, paul, samuel, reinsch, and, at, columbia, university, in, 1910, by, 1920, there, were, four, universities, that, taught, courses, on, international, organization, georgetown, university, s, walsh, school, of, foreign, service, is, the, oldest, continuously, operating, school, for, international, affairs, in, the, united, states, founded, in, 1919, in, 1927, the, london, school, of, economics, department, of, international, relations, was, founded, at, the, behest, of, nobel, peace, prize, winner, philip, noel, baker, this, was, the, first, institute, to, offer, a, wide, range, of, degrees, in, the, field, that, same, year, the, graduate, institute, of, international, and, development, studies, a, school, dedicated, to, teaching, international, affairs, was, founded, in, geneva, switzerland, this, was, rapidly, followed, by, establishment, of, ir, at, universities, in, the, us, the, creation, of, the, posts, of, montague, burton, professor, of, international, relations, at, lse, and, at, oxford, gave, further, impetus, to, the, academic, study, of, international, relations, furthermore, the, international, history, department, at, lse, developed, a, focus, on, the, history, of, ir, in, the, early, modern, colonial, and, cold, war, periods, the, first, university, entirely, dedicated, to, the, study, of, ir, was, the, graduate, institute, of, international, and, development, studies, which, was, founded, in, 1927, to, form, diplomats, associated, to, the, league, of, nations, in, 1922, georgetown, university, graduated, its, first, class, of, the, master, of, science, in, foreign, service, msfs, degree, making, it, the, first, international, relations, graduate, program, in, the, united, states, this, was, soon, followed, by, the, establishment, of, the, committee, on, international, relations, cir, at, the, university, of, chicago, where, the, first, research, graduate, degree, was, conferred, in, 1928, the, fletcher, school, of, law, and, diplomacy, a, collaboration, between, tufts, university, and, harvard, university, opened, its, doors, in, 1933, as, the, first, graduate, only, school, of, international, affairs, in, the, united, states, in, 1965, glendon, college, and, the, norman, paterson, school, of, international, affairs, were, the, first, institutions, in, canada, to, offer, an, undergraduate, and, a, graduate, program, in, international, studies, and, affairs, respectively, the, lines, between, ir, and, other, political, science, subfields, is, sometimes, blurred, in, particular, when, it, comes, to, the, study, of, conflict, institutions, political, economy, and, political, behavior, the, division, between, comparative, politics, and, international, relations, is, artificial, as, processes, within, nations, shape, international, processes, and, international, processes, shape, processes, within, states, some, scholars, have, called, for, an, integration, of, the, fields, comparative, politics, does, not, have, similar, isms, as, international, relations, scholarship, critical, scholarship, in, international, relations, has, explored, the, relationship, between, the, institutionalization, of, international, relations, as, an, academic, discipline, and, the, demands, of, national, governments, robert, vitalis, s, book, white, world, order, black, power, politics, details, the, historical, imbrication, of, ir, in, the, projects, of, colonial, administration, and, imperialism, while, other, scholars, have, traced, the, emergence, of, international, relations, in, relation, to, the, consolidation, of, newly, independent, nation, states, within, the, non, west, such, as, brazil, and, india, within, the, study, of, international, relations, there, exists, multiple, theories, seeking, to, explain, how, states, and, other, actors, operate, within, the, international, system, these, can, generally, be, divided, into, the, three, main, strands, of, realism, liberalism, and, constructivism, the, realist, framework, of, international, relations, rests, on, the, fundamental, assumption, that, the, international, state, system, is, an, anarchy, with, no, overarching, power, restricting, the, behaviour, of, sovereign, states, as, a, consequence, states, are, engaged, in, a, continuous, power, struggle, where, they, seek, to, augment, their, own, military, capabilities, economic, power, and, diplomacy, relative, to, other, states, this, in, order, to, ensure, the, protection, of, their, political, system, citizens, and, vital, interests, the, realist, framework, further, assumes, that, states, act, as, unitary, rational, actors, where, central, decision, makers, in, the, state, apparatus, ultimately, stand, for, most, of, the, state, s, foreign, policy, decisions, international, organizations, are, in, consequence, merely, seen, as, tools, for, individual, states, used, to, further, their, own, interests, and, are, thought, to, have, little, power, in, shaping, states, foreign, policies, on, their, own, the, realist, framework, is, traditionally, associated, with, the, analysis, of, power, politics, and, has, been, used, to, analyze, the, conflicts, between, states, in, the, early, european, state, system, the, causes, of, the, first, and, second, world, wars, as, well, as, the, behavior, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, during, the, cold, war, in, settings, such, as, these, the, realist, framework, carries, great, interpretative, insights, in, explaining, how, the, military, and, economic, power, struggles, of, states, lead, to, larger, armed, conflicts, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, written, by, thucydides, is, considered, a, foundational, text, of, the, realist, school, of, political, philosophy, there, is, debate, over, whether, thucydides, himself, was, a, realist, richard, ned, lebow, has, argued, that, seeing, thucydides, as, a, realist, is, a, misinterpretation, of, a, more, complex, political, message, within, his, work, amongst, others, philosophers, like, machiavelli, hobbes, and, rousseau, are, considered, to, have, contributed, to, the, realist, philosophy, however, while, their, work, may, support, realist, doctrine, it, is, not, likely, that, they, would, have, classified, themselves, as, realists, in, this, sense, political, realism, believes, that, politics, like, society, is, governed, by, objective, laws, with, roots, in, human, nature, to, improve, society, it, is, first, necessary, to, understand, the, laws, by, which, society, lives, the, operation, of, these, laws, being, impervious, to, our, preferences, persons, will, challenge, them, only, at, the, risk, of, failure, realism, believing, as, it, does, in, the, objectivity, of, the, laws, of, politics, must, also, believe, in, the, possibility, of, developing, a, rational, theory, that, reflects, however, imperfectly, and, one, sidedly, these, objective, laws, it, believes, also, then, in, the, possibility, of, distinguishing, in, politics, between, truth, and, opinion, between, what, is, true, objectively, and, rationally, supported, by, evidence, and, illuminated, by, reason, and, what, is, only, a, subjective, judgment, divorced, from, the, facts, as, they, are, and, informed, by, prejudice, and, wishful, thinking, major, theorists, include, e, h, carr, robert, gilpin, charles, p, kindleberger, stephen, d, krasner, hans, morgenthau, kenneth, waltz, robert, jervis, stephen, walt, and, john, mearsheimer, in, contrast, to, realism, the, liberal, framework, emphasises, that, states, although, they, are, sovereign, do, not, exist, in, a, purely, anarchical, system, rather, liberal, theory, assumes, that, states, are, institutionally, constrained, by, the, power, of, international, organisations, and, mutually, dependent, on, one, another, through, economic, and, diplomatic, ties, institutions, such, as, the, united, nations, the, world, trade, organisation, wto, and, the, international, court, of, justice, are, taken, to, over, time, have, developed, power, and, influence, to, shape, the, foreign, policies, of, individual, states, furthermore, the, existence, of, the, globalised, world, economy, makes, continuous, military, power, struggle, irrational, as, states, are, dependent, on, participation, in, the, global, trade, system, to, ensure, their, own, survival, as, such, the, liberal, framework, stresses, cooperation, between, states, as, a, fundamental, part, of, the, international, system, states, are, not, seen, as, unitary, actors, but, pluralistic, arenas, where, interest, groups, non, governmental, organisations, and, economic, actors, also, shape, the, creation, of, foreign, policy, the, liberal, framework, is, associated, with, analysis, of, the, globalised, world, as, it, emerged, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, increased, political, cooperation, through, organisations, such, as, the, un, as, well, as, economic, cooperation, through, institutions, such, as, the, wto, the, world, bank, and, the, international, monetary, fund, was, thought, to, have, made, the, realist, analysis, of, power, and, conflict, inadequate, in, explaining, the, workings, of, the, international, system, the, intellectual, basis, of, liberal, theory, is, often, cited, as, immanuel, kant, s, essay, perpetual, peace, from, 1795, in, it, he, postulates, that, states, over, time, through, increased, political, and, economic, cooperation, will, come, to, resemble, an, international, federation, a, world, government, which, will, be, characterised, by, continual, peace, and, cooperation, in, modern, times, liberal, international, relations, theory, arose, after, world, war, i, in, response, to, the, ability, of, states, to, control, and, limit, war, in, their, international, relations, early, adherents, include, woodrow, wilson, and, norman, angell, who, argued, that, states, mutually, gained, from, cooperation, and, that, war, was, so, destructive, as, to, be, essentially, futile, liberalism, was, not, recognized, as, a, coherent, theory, as, such, until, it, was, collectively, and, derisively, termed, idealism, by, e, h, carr, a, new, version, of, idealism, that, focused, on, human, rights, as, the, basis, of, the, legitimacy, of, international, law, was, advanced, by, hans, k, chler, major, theorists, include, montesquieu, immanuel, kant, michael, w, doyle, francis, fukuyama, and, helen, milner, liberal, institutionalism, some, times, referred, to, as, neoliberalism, shows, how, cooperation, can, be, achieved, in, international, relations, even, if, neorealist, assumptions, apply, states, are, the, key, actors, in, world, politics, the, international, system, is, anarchic, and, states, pursue, their, self, interest, liberal, institutionalists, highlight, the, role, of, international, institutions, and, regimes, in, facilitating, cooperation, between, states, prominent, neoliberal, institutionalists, are, john, ikenberry, robert, keohane, and, joseph, nye, robert, keohane, s, 1984, book, after, hegemony, used, insights, from, the, new, institutional, economics, to, argue, that, the, international, system, could, remain, stable, in, the, absence, of, a, hegemon, thus, rebutting, hegemonic, stability, theory, regime, theory, is, derived, from, the, liberal, tradition, that, argues, that, international, institutions, or, regimes, affect, the, behaviour, of, states, or, other, international, actors, it, assumes, that, cooperation, is, possible, in, the, anarchic, system, of, states, indeed, regimes, are, by, definition, instances, of, international, cooperation, while, realism, predicts, that, conflict, should, be, the, norm, in, international, relations, regime, theorists, say, that, there, is, cooperation, despite, anarchy, often, they, cite, cooperation, in, trade, human, rights, and, collective, security, among, other, issues, these, instances, of, cooperation, are, regimes, the, most, commonly, cited, definition, of, regimes, comes, from, stephen, krasner, who, defines, regimes, as, principles, norms, rules, and, decision, making, procedures, around, which, actor, expectations, converge, in, a, given, issue, area, not, all, approaches, to, regime, theory, however, are, liberal, or, neoliberal, some, realist, scholars, like, joseph, grieco, have, developed, hybrid, theories, which, take, a, realist, based, approach, to, this, fundamentally, liberal, theory, realists, do, not, say, cooperation, never, happens, just, that, it, is, not, the, norm, it, is, a, difference, of, degree, the, constructivist, framework, rests, on, the, fundamental, assumption, that, the, international, system, is, built, on, social, constructs, such, as, ideas, norms, and, identities, various, political, actors, such, as, state, leaders, policy, makers, and, the, leaders, of, international, organisations, are, socialised, into, different, roles, and, systems, of, norms, which, define, how, the, international, system, operates, the, constructivist, scholar, alexander, wendt, in, a, 1992, article, in, international, organization, noted, in, response, to, realism, that, anarchy, is, what, states, make, of, it, by, this, he, means, that, the, anarchic, structure, that, realists, claim, governs, state, interaction, is, in, fact, a, phenomenon, that, is, socially, constructed, and, reproduced, by, states, constructivism, is, part, of, critical, theory, and, as, such, seeks, to, criticise, the, assumptions, underlying, traditional, ir, theory, constructivist, theory, would, for, example, claim, that, the, state, leaders, of, the, united, states, and, soviet, union, were, socialised, into, different, roles, and, norms, which, can, provide, theoretical, insights, to, how, the, conflict, between, the, nations, was, conducted, during, the, cold, war, e, g, prominent, us, policy, makers, frequently, spoke, of, the, ussr, as, an, evil, empire, and, thus, socialised, the, us, population, and, state, apparatus, into, an, anti, communist, sentiment, which, defined, the, norms, conducted, in, us, foreign, policy, other, constructivist, analyses, include, the, discourses, on, european, integration, senior, policy, making, circles, were, socialised, into, ideas, of, europe, as, an, historical, and, cultural, community, and, therefore, sought, to, construct, institutions, to, integrate, european, nations, into, a, single, political, body, constructivism, is, also, present, in, the, analysis, of, international, law, where, norms, of, conduct, such, as, the, prohibition, of, chemical, weapons, torture, and, the, protection, of, civilians, in, war, are, socialised, into, international, organisations, and, stipulated, into, rules, prominent, constructivist, ir, scholars, include, michael, barnett, martha, finnemore, ted, hopf, peter, katzenstein, kathryn, sikkink, and, alexander, wendt, post, structuralism, theories, of, international, relations, also, called, critical, theories, due, to, being, inherently, critical, of, traditional, ir, frameworks, developed, in, the, 1980s, from, postmodernist, studies, in, political, science, post, structuralism, explores, the, deconstruction, of, concepts, traditionally, not, problematic, in, ir, such, as, power, and, agency, and, examines, how, the, construction, of, these, concepts, shapes, international, relations, the, examination, of, narratives, plays, an, important, part, in, poststructuralist, analysis, for, example, feminist, poststructuralist, work, has, examined, the, role, that, women, play, in, global, society, and, how, they, are, constructed, in, war, as, innocent, and, civilians, rosenberg, s, article, why, is, there, no, international, historical, sociology, was, a, key, text, in, the, evolution, of, this, strand, of, international, relations, theory, post, structuralism, has, garnered, both, significant, praise, and, criticism, with, its, critics, arguing, that, post, structuralist, research, often, fails, to, address, the, real, world, problems, that, international, relations, studies, is, supposed, to, contribute, to, solving, constructivist, theory, see, above, is, the, most, prominent, strand, of, post, structuralism, other, prominent, post, structuralist, theories, are, marxism, dependency, theory, feminism, and, the, theories, of, the, english, school, see, also, critical, international, relations, theory, marxist, theories, of, ir, reject, the, realist, liberal, view, of, state, conflict, or, cooperation, instead, focusing, on, the, economic, and, material, aspects, it, makes, the, assumption, that, the, economy, trumps, other, concerns, making, economic, class, the, fundamental, level, of, analysis, marxists, view, the, international, system, as, an, integrated, capitalist, system, in, pursuit, of, capital, accumulation, thus, colonialism, brought, in, sources, for, raw, materials, and, captive, markets, for, exports, while, decolonialization, brought, new, opportunities, in, the, form, of, dependence, a, prominent, derivative, of, marxian, thought, is, critical, international, relations, theory, which, is, the, application, of, critical, theory, to, international, relations, early, critical, theorists, were, associated, with, the, frankfurt, school, which, followed, marx, s, concern, with, the, conditions, that, allow, for, social, change, and, the, establishment, of, rational, institutions, their, emphasis, on, the, critical, component, of, theory, was, derived, significantly, from, their, attempt, to, overcome, the, limits, of, positivism, modern, day, proponents, such, as, andrew, linklater, robert, w, cox, and, ken, booth, focus, on, the, need, for, human, emancipation, from, the, nation, state, hence, it, is, critical, of, mainstream, ir, theories, that, tend, to, be, both, positivist, and, state, centric, further, linked, in, with, marxist, theories, is, dependency, theory, and, the, core, periphery, model, which, argue, that, developed, countries, in, their, pursuit, of, power, appropriate, developing, states, through, international, banking, security, and, trade, agreements, and, unions, on, a, formal, level, and, do, so, through, the, interaction, of, political, and, financial, advisors, missionaries, relief, aid, workers, and, mncs, on, the, informal, level, in, order, to, integrate, them, into, the, capitalist, system, strategically, appropriating, undervalued, natural, resources, and, labor, hours, and, fostering, economic, and, political, dependence, feminist, ir, considers, the, ways, that, international, politics, affects, and, is, affected, by, both, men, and, women, and, also, at, how, the, core, concepts, that, are, employed, within, the, discipline, of, ir, e, g, war, security, etc, are, themselves, gendered, feminist, ir, has, not, only, concerned, itself, with, the, traditional, focus, of, ir, on, states, wars, diplomacy, and, security, but, feminist, ir, scholars, have, also, emphasized, the, importance, of, looking, at, how, gender, shapes, the, current, global, political, economy, in, this, sense, there, is, no, clear, cut, division, between, feminists, working, in, ir, and, those, working, in, the, area, of, international, political, economy, ipe, from, its, inception, feminist, ir, has, also, theorized, extensively, about, men, and, in, particular, masculinities, many, ir, feminists, argue, that, the, discipline, is, inherently, masculine, in, nature, for, example, in, her, article, sex, and, death, in, the, rational, world, of, defense, intellectuals, signs, 1988, carol, cohn, claimed, that, a, highly, masculinized, culture, within, the, defense, establishment, contributed, to, the, divorcing, of, war, from, human, emotion, feminist, ir, emerged, largely, from, the, late, 1980s, onward, the, end, of, the, cold, war, and, the, re, evaluation, of, traditional, ir, theory, during, the, 1990s, opened, up, a, space, for, gendering, international, relations, because, feminist, ir, is, linked, broadly, to, the, critical, project, in, ir, by, and, large, most, feminist, scholarship, have, sought, to, problematize, the, politics, of, knowledge, construction, within, the, discipline, often, by, adopting, methodologies, of, deconstructivism, associated, with, postmodernism, poststructuralism, however, the, growing, influence, of, feminist, and, women, centric, approaches, within, the, international, policy, communities, for, example, at, the, world, bank, and, the, united, nations, is, more, reflective, of, the, liberal, feminist, emphasis, on, equality, of, opportunity, for, women, prominent, scholars, include, carol, cohn, cynthia, enloe, sara, ruddick, and, j, ann, tickner, international, society, theory, also, called, the, english, school, focuses, on, the, shared, norms, and, values, of, states, and, how, they, regulate, international, relations, examples, of, such, norms, include, diplomacy, order, and, international, law, theorists, have, focused, particularly, on, humanitarian, intervention, and, are, subdivided, between, solidarists, who, tend, to, advocate, it, more, and, pluralists, who, place, greater, value, in, order, and, sovereignty, nicholas, wheeler, is, a, prominent, solidarist, while, hedley, bull, and, robert, h, jackson, are, perhaps, the, best, known, pluralists, some, english, school, theoreticians, have, used, historical, cases, in, order, to, show, the, influence, that, normative, frameworks, have, on, the, evolution, of, the, international, political, order, at, various, critical, junctures, international, relations, are, often, viewed, in, terms, of, levels, of, analysis, the, systemic, level, concepts, are, those, broad, concepts, that, define, and, shape, an, international, milieu, characterized, by, anarchy, focusing, on, the, systemic, level, of, international, relations, is, often, but, not, always, the, preferred, method, for, neo, realists, and, other, structuralist, ir, analysts, preceding, the, concepts, of, interdependence, and, dependence, international, relations, relies, on, the, idea, of, sovereignty, described, in, jean, bodin, s, six, books, of, the, commonwealth, in, 1576, the, three, pivotal, points, derived, from, the, book, describe, sovereignty, as, being, a, state, that, the, sovereign, power, s, have, absolute, power, over, their, territories, and, that, such, a, power, is, only, limited, by, the, sovereign, s, own, obligations, towards, other, sovereigns, and, individuals, such, a, foundation, of, sovereignty, is, indicated, by, a, sovereign, s, obligation, to, other, sovereigns, interdependence, and, dependence, to, take, place, while, throughout, world, history, there, have, been, instances, of, groups, lacking, or, losing, sovereignty, such, as, african, nations, prior, to, decolonization, or, the, occupation, of, iraq, during, the, iraq, war, there, is, still, a, need, for, sovereignty, in, terms, of, assessing, international, relations, the, concept, of, power, in, international, relations, can, be, described, as, the, degree, of, resources, capabilities, and, influence, in, international, affairs, it, is, often, divided, up, into, the, concepts, of, hard, power, and, soft, power, hard, power, relating, primarily, to, coercive, power, such, as, the, use, of, force, and, soft, power, commonly, covering, economics, diplomacy, and, cultural, influence, however, there, is, no, clear, dividing, line, between, the, two, forms, of, power, perhaps, the, most, significant, concept, behind, that, of, power, and, sovereignty, national, interest, is, a, state, s, action, in, relation, to, other, states, where, it, seeks, to, gain, advantage, or, benefits, to, itself, national, interest, whether, aspirational, or, operational, is, divided, by, core, vital, and, peripheral, non, vital, interests, core, or, vital, interests, constitute, the, things, which, a, country, is, willing, to, defend, or, expand, with, conflict, such, as, territory, ideology, religious, political, economic, or, its, citizens, peripheral, or, non, vital, are, interests, which, a, state, is, willing, to, compromise, for, example, in, germany, s, annexation, of, the, sudetenland, in, 1938, a, part, of, czechoslovakia, under, the, munich, agreement, czechoslovakia, was, willing, to, relinquish, territory, which, was, considered, ethnically, german, in, order, to, preserve, its, own, integrity, and, sovereignty, in, the, 21st, century, the, status, quo, of, the, international, system, is, no, longer, monopolized, by, states, alone, rather, it, is, the, presence, of, non, state, actors, who, autonomously, act, to, implement, unpredictable, behaviour, to, the, international, system, whether, it, is, transnational, corporations, liberation, movements, non, governmental, agencies, or, international, organizations, these, entities, have, the, potential, to, significantly, influence, the, outcome, of, any, international, transaction, additionally, this, also, includes, the, individual, person, as, while, the, individual, is, what, constitutes, the, states, collective, entity, the, individual, does, have, the, potential, to, also, create, unpredicted, behaviours, al, qaeda, as, an, example, of, a, non, state, actor, has, significantly, influenced, the, way, states, and, non, state, actors, conduct, international, affairs, the, existence, of, power, blocs, in, international, relations, is, a, significant, factor, related, to, polarity, during, the, cold, war, the, alignment, of, several, nations, to, one, side, or, another, based, on, ideological, differences, or, national, interests, has, become, an, endemic, feature, of, international, relations, unlike, prior, shorter, term, blocs, the, western, and, eastern, blocs, sought, to, spread, their, national, ideological, differences, to, other, nations, leaders, like, us, president, harry, s, truman, under, the, truman, doctrine, believed, it, was, necessary, to, spread, democracy, whereas, the, warsaw, pact, under, soviet, policy, sought, to, spread, communism, after, the, cold, war, and, the, dissolution, of, the, ideologically, homogeneous, eastern, bloc, still, gave, rise, to, others, such, as, the, south, south, cooperation, movement, polarity, in, international, relations, refers, to, the, arrangement, of, power, within, the, international, system, the, concept, arose, from, bipolarity, during, the, cold, war, with, the, international, system, dominated, by, the, conflict, between, two, superpowers, and, has, been, applied, retrospectively, by, theorists, however, the, term, bipolar, was, notably, used, by, stalin, who, said, he, saw, the, international, system, as, a, bipolar, one, with, two, opposing, power, bases, and, ideologies, consequently, the, international, system, prior, to, 1945, can, be, described, as, multipolar, with, power, being, shared, among, great, powers, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, had, led, to, unipolarity, with, the, united, states, as, a, sole, superpower, although, many, refuse, to, acknowledge, the, fact, china, s, continued, rapid, economic, growth, it, became, the, world, s, second, largest, economy, in, 2010, respectable, international, position, and, the, power, the, chinese, government, exerts, over, its, people, consisting, of, the, second, largest, population, in, the, world, resulted, in, debate, over, whether, china, is, now, a, superpower, or, a, possible, candidate, in, the, future, however, china, s, strategic, force, unable, of, projecting, power, beyond, its, region, and, its, nuclear, arsenal, of, 250, warheads, compared, to, 7, 315, of, the, united, states, mean, that, the, unipolarity, will, persist, in, the, policy, relevant, future, several, theories, of, international, relations, draw, upon, the, idea, of, polarity, the, balance, of, power, was, a, concept, prevalent, in, europe, prior, to, the, first, world, war, the, thought, being, that, by, balancing, power, blocs, it, would, create, stability, and, prevent, war, theories, of, the, balance, of, power, gained, prominence, again, during, the, cold, war, being, a, central, mechanism, of, kenneth, waltz, s, neorealism, here, the, concepts, of, balancing, rising, in, power, to, counter, another, and, bandwagonning, siding, with, another, are, developed, robert, gilpin, s, hegemonic, stability, theory, also, draws, upon, the, idea, of, polarity, specifically, the, state, of, unipolarity, hegemony, is, the, preponderance, of, power, at, one, pole, in, the, international, system, and, the, theory, argues, this, is, a, stable, configuration, because, of, mutual, gains, by, both, the, dominant, power, and, others, in, the, international, system, this, is, contrary, to, many, neorealist, arguments, particularly, made, by, kenneth, waltz, stating, that, the, end, of, the, cold, war, and, the, state, of, unipolarity, is, an, unstable, configuration, that, will, inevitably, change, the, case, of, gilpin, proved, to, be, correct, and, waltz, s, article, titled, the, stability, of, a, bipolar, world, was, followed, in, 1999, by, william, wohlforth, s, article, titled, the, stability, of, a, unipolar, world, waltz, s, thesis, can, be, expressed, in, power, transition, theory, which, states, that, it, is, likely, that, a, great, power, would, challenge, a, hegemon, after, a, certain, period, resulting, in, a, major, war, it, suggests, that, while, hegemony, can, control, the, occurrence, of, wars, it, also, results, in, the, creation, of, one, its, main, proponent, a, f, k, organski, argued, this, based, on, the, occurrence, of, previous, wars, during, british, portuguese, and, dutch, hegemony, many, advocate, that, the, current, international, system, is, characterized, by, growing, interdependence, the, mutual, responsibility, and, dependency, on, others, advocates, of, this, point, to, growing, globalization, particularly, with, international, economic, interaction, the, role, of, international, institutions, and, widespread, acceptance, of, a, number, of, operating, principles, in, the, international, system, reinforces, ideas, that, relations, are, characterized, by, interdependence, dependency, theory, is, a, theory, most, commonly, associated, with, marxism, stating, that, a, set, of, core, states, exploit, a, set, of, weaker, periphery, states, for, their, prosperity, various, versions, of, the, theory, suggest, that, this, is, either, an, inevitability, standard, dependency, theory, or, use, the, theory, to, highlight, the, necessity, for, change, neo, marxist, as, a, level, of, analysis, the, unit, level, is, often, referred, to, as, the, state, level, as, it, locates, its, explanation, at, the, level, of, the, state, rather, than, the, international, system, it, is, often, considered, that, a, state, s, form, of, government, can, dictate, the, way, that, a, state, interacts, with, others, in, the, international, relation, democratic, peace, theory, is, a, theory, that, suggests, that, the, nature, of, democracy, means, that, democratic, countries, will, not, go, to, war, with, each, other, the, justifications, for, this, are, that, democracies, externalize, their, norms, and, only, go, to, war, for, just, causes, and, that, democracy, encourages, mutual, trust, and, respect, communism, justifies, a, world, revolution, which, similarly, would, lead, to, peaceful, coexistence, based, on, a, proletarian, global, society, states, can, be, classified, by, whether, they, accept, the, international, status, quo, or, are, revisionist, i, e, want, change, revisionist, states, seek, to, fundamentally, change, the, rules, and, practices, of, international, relations, feeling, disadvantaged, by, the, status, quo, they, see, the, international, system, as, a, largely, western, creation, which, serves, to, reinforce, current, realities, japan, is, an, example, of, a, state, that, has, gone, from, being, a, revisionist, state, to, one, that, is, satisfied, with, the, status, quo, because, the, status, quo, is, now, beneficial, to, it, religion, can, have, an, effect, on, the, way, a, state, acts, within, the, international, system, and, different, theoretical, perspectives, treat, it, in, somewhat, different, fashion, one, dramatic, example, is, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, that, ravaged, much, of, europe, which, was, at, least, partly, motivated, by, theological, differences, within, christianity, religion, is, a, major, organizing, principle, particularly, for, islamic, states, whereas, secularism, sits, at, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, with, the, separation, of, state, and, religion, being, responsible, for, the, liberal, international, relations, theory, the, september, 11, attacks, in, the, united, states, the, role, of, islam, in, terrorism, and, religious, strife, in, the, middle, east, have, made, the, role, of, religion, in, international, relations, a, major, topic, china, s, reemergence, as, a, major, international, power, is, believed, by, some, scholars, to, be, shaped, by, confucianism, the, level, beneath, that, of, the, unit, state, can, be, useful, both, for, explaining, factors, in, international, relations, that, other, theories, fail, to, explain, and, for, moving, away, from, a, state, centric, view, of, international, relations, area, studies, are, the, divisional, parts, of, international, studies, in, which, various, geopolitical, regions, are, studied, in, detail, many, university, departments, are, offering, area, studies, in, diverse, titles, international, institutions, form, a, vital, part, of, contemporary, international, relations, the, united, nations, un, is, an, international, organization, that, describes, itself, as, a, global, association, of, governments, facilitating, co, operation, in, international, law, international, security, economic, development, and, social, equity, it, is, the, most, prominent, international, institution, many, of, the, legal, institutions, follow, the, same, organizational, structure, as, the, un, the, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, oic, is, an, international, organization, consisting, of, 57, member,
