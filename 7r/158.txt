stephen, wilson, has, described, the, narrative, as, exceptionally, obscure, and, various, points, of, disagreement, persist, among, bible, scholars, some, biblical, commentators, have, sought, to, establish, that, the, house, given, as, the, location, of, the, events, in, acts, 2, 2, was, one, of, the, thirty, halls, of, the, temple, where, st, john, s, school, is, now, placed, called, but, the, text, itself, is, lacking, in, specific, details, richard, c, h, lenski, and, other, scholars, contend, that, the, author, of, acts, could, have, chosen, the, word, sanctuary, or, temple, if, this, meaning, were, intended, rather, than, house, some, semantic, details, suggest, that, the, house, could, be, the, upper, room, mentioned, in, acts, 1, 12, 26, but, there, is, no, literary, evidence, to, confirm, the, location, with, certainty, and, it, remains, a, subject, of, dispute, amongst, scholars, the, events, of, acts, chapter, 2, are, set, against, the, backdrop, of, the, celebration, of, pentecost, in, jerusalem, there, are, several, major, features, to, the, pentecost, narrative, presented, in, the, second, chapter, of, the, acts, of, the, apostles, the, author, begins, by, noting, that, the, disciples, of, jesus, were, all, together, in, one, place, on, the, day, of, pentecost, the, verb, used, in, acts, 2, 1, to, indicate, the, arrival, of, the, day, of,

disciples, were, filled, with, the, holy, spirit, and, began, to, speak, in, other, tongues, as, the, spirit, gave, them, utterance, some, scholars, have, interpreted, the, passage, as, a, reference, to, the, multitude, of, languages, spoken, by, the, gathered, disciples, while, others, have, taken, the, reference, to, tongues, to, signify, ecstatic, speech, in, christian, tradition, this, event, represents, fulfillment, of, the, promise, that, christ, will, baptize, his, followers, with, the, holy, spirit, out, of, the, four, new, testament, gospels, the, distinction, between, baptism, by, water, and, the, baptism, by, christ, with, holy, spirit, and, fire, is, only, found, in, matthew, and, luke, the, narrative, in, acts, evokes, the, symbolism, of, jesus, s, baptism, in, the, jordan, river, and, the, start, of, his, ministry, by, explicitly, connecting, the, earlier, prophecy, of, john, the, baptist, to, the, baptism, of, the, disciples, with, the, holy, spirit, on, the, day, of, pentecost, the, timing, of, the, narrative, during, the, law, giving, festival, of, pentecost, symbolizes, both, continuity, with, the, giving, of, the, law, but, also, the, central, role, of, the, holy, spirit, for, the, early, church, the, central, role, of, christ, in, christian, faith, signified, a, fundamental, theological, separation, from, the, traditional, jewish, faith, which, was, grounded, in, the, torah, and, mosaic, law, peter, s, sermon, in, acts, 2, 14, 36, stresses, the, resurrection, and, exaltation, in, his, sermon, peter, quotes, joel, 2, 28, 32, and, psalm, 16, to, indicate, that, first, pentecost, marks, the, start, of, the, messianic, age, about, one, hundred, and, twenty, followers, of, christ, acts, 1, 15, were, present, including, the, twelve, apostles, matthias, was, judas, s, replacement, acts, 1, 13, 26, jesus, s, mother, mary, other, female, disciples, and, his, brothers, acts, 1, 14, while, those, on, whom, the, spirit, had, descended, were, speaking, in, many, languages, the, apostle, peter, stood, up, with, the, eleven, and, proclaimed, to, the, crowd, that, this, event, was, the, fulfillment, of, the, prophecy, in, acts, 2, 17, it, reads, and, in, the, last, days, god, says, i, will, pour, out, my, spirit, upon, every, sort, of, flesh, and, your, sons, and, your, daughters, will, prophesy, and, your, young, men, will, see, visions, and, your, old, men, will, dream, dreams, he, also, mentions, acts, 2, 15, that, it, was, the, third, hour, of, the, day, about, 9, 00, am, acts, 2, 41, then, reports, then, they, that, gladly, received, his, word, were, baptized, and, the, same, day, there, were, added, unto, them, about, three, thousand, souls, critical, scholars, believe, some, features, of, the, narrative, are, theological, constructions, they, believe, that, even, if, the, pentecost, narrative, is, not, literally, true, it, does, signify, an, important, event, in, the, history, of, the, early, church, which, enabled, the, rapid, spread, of, christianity, within, a, few, decades, important, congregations, had, been, established, in, all, major, cities, of, the, roman, empire, biblical, commentator, richard, c, h, lenski, has, noted, that, the, use, of, the, term, pentecost, in, acts, is, a, reference, to, the, jewish, festival, he, writes, that, a, well, defined, distinct, christian, celebration, did, not, exist, until, later, years, when, christians, kept, the, name, of, pentecost, but, began, to, calculate, the, date, of, the, feast, based, on, easter, rather, than, passover, peter, stated, that, this, event, was, the, beginning, of, a, continual, outpouring, that, would, be, available, to, all, believers, from, that, point, on, jews, and, gentiles, alike, in, the,

through, her, powerful, prayers, obtained, that, the, spirit, of, our, divine, redeemer, already, given, on, the, cross, should, be, bestowed, accompanied, by, miraculous, gifts, on, the, newly, founded, church, at, pentecost, and, finally, bearing, with, courage, and, confidence, the, tremendous, burden, of, her, sorrows, and, desolation, she, truly, the, queen, of, martyrs, more, than, all, the, faithful, filled, up, those, things, that, are, wanting, of, the, sufferings, of, christ, for, his, body, which, is, the, church, and, she, continues, to, have, for, the, mystical, body, of,

for, the, holy, spirit, christians, of, every, age, have, frequently, had, recourse, to, her, intercession, on, the, long, and, tiring, journey, to, salvation, in, order, to, receive, the, gifts, of, the, paraclete, in, greater, abundance, in, the, church, and, for, the, church, mindful, of, jesus, s, promise, she, waits, for, pentecost, and, implores, a, multiplicity, of, gifts, for, everyone,
