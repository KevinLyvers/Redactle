vittorio, emanuele, ii, in, milan, which, opened, in, 1877, was, larger, than, its, predecessors, and, inspired, the, use, of, the, term, galleria, for, many, other, shopping, arcades, and, malls, in, the, mid, 20th, century, with, the, rise, of, the, suburb, and, automobile, culture, in, the, united, states, a, new, style, of, shopping, center, was, created, away, from, downtowns, early, shopping, centers, designed, for, the, automobile, include, market, square, lake, forest, illinois, 1916, and, country, club, plaza, kansas, city, missouri, 1924, the, suburban, shopping, center, concept, evolved, further, in, the, united, states, after, world, war, ii, with, larger, open, air, shopping, centers, anchored, by, major, department, stores, such, as, the, 550, 000, square, foot, 51, 000, m, 2, broadway, crenshaw, center, in, los, angeles, built, in, 1947, and, anchored, by, a, five, story, broadway, and, a, may, company, california, in, the, late, 1950s, and, into, the, 1960s, the, term, shopping, mall, was, first, used, but, in, the, original, sense, of, the, word, mall, meaning, a, pedestrian, promenade, in, the, u, s, or, in, u, k, usage, a, shopping, precinct, early, downtown, pedestrianized, malls, included, the, kalamazoo, mall, the, first, in, 1959, shoppers, see, way, in, toledo, lincoln, road, mall, in, miami, beach, santa, monica, mall, 1965, although, bergen, mall, opened, in, 1957, using, the, name, mall, and, inspired, other, suburban, shopping, centers, to, rebrand, themselves, as, malls, these, types, of, properties, were, still, referred, to, as, shopping, centers, until, the, late, 1960s, the, enclosed, shopping, center, which, would, eventually, be, known, as, the, shopping, mall, did, not, appear, in, mainstream, until, the, mid, 1950s, one, of, the, earliest, examples, was, the, valley, fair, shopping, center, in, appleton, wisconsin, which, opened, on, march, 10, 1955, valley, fair, featured, a, number, of, modern, features, including, central, heating, and, cooling, a, large, outdoor, parking, area, semi, detached, anchor, stores, and, restaurants, later, that, year, the, world, s, first, fully, enclosed, shopping, mall, was, opened, in, lule, in, northern, sweden, architect, ralph, erskine, and, was, named, shopping, the, region, now, claims, the, highest, shopping, center, density, in, europe, the, idea, of, a, regionally, sized, fully, enclosed, shopping, complex, was, pioneered, in, 1956, by, the, austrian, born, architect, and, american, immigrant, victor, gruen, this, new, generation, of, regional, size, shopping, centers, began, with, the, gruen, designed, southdale, center, which, opened, in, the, twin, cities, suburb, of, edina, minnesota, united, states, in, october, 1956, for, pioneering, the, soon, to, be, enormously, popular, mall, concept, in, this, form, gruen, has, been, called, the, most, influential, architect, of, the, twentieth, century, by, malcolm, gladwell, the, first, retail, complex, to, be, promoted, as, a, mall, was, paramus, new, jersey, s, bergen, mall, which, opened, with, an, open, air, format, on, november, 14, 1957, and, was, later, enclosed, in, 1973, aside, from, southdale, center, significant, early, enclosed, shopping, malls, were, harundale, mall, 1958, in, glen, burnie, maryland, big, town, mall, 1959, in, mesquite, texas, chris, town, mall, 1961, in, phoenix, arizona, and, randhurst, center, 1962, in, mount, prospect, illinois, other, early, malls, moved, retailing, away, from, the, dense, commercial, downtowns, into, the, largely, residential, suburbs, this, formula, enclosed, space, with, stores, attached, away, from, downtown, and, accessible, only, by, automobile, became, a, popular, way, to, build, retail, across, the, world, gruen, himself, came, to, abhor, this, effect, of, his, new, design, he, decried, the, creation, of, enormous, land, wasting, seas, of, parking, and, the, spread, of, suburban, sprawl, even, though, malls, mostly, appeared, in, suburban, areas, in, the, u, s, some, u, s, cities, facilitated, the, construction, of, enclosed, malls, downtown, as, an, effort, to, revive, city, centers, and, allow, them, to, compete, effectively, with, suburban, malls, examples, included, main, place, mall, in, buffalo, 1969, and, the, gallery, 1977, now, fashion, district, philadelphia, in, philadelphia, other, cities, created, open, air, pedestrian, malls, in, the, united, states, developers, such, as, a, alfred, taubman, of, taubman, centers, extended, the, concept, further, in, 1980, with, terrazzo, tiles, at, the, mall, at, short, hills, in, new, jersey, indoor, fountains, and, two, levels, allowing, a, shopper, to, make, a, circuit, of, all, the, stores, taubman, believed, carpeting, increased, friction, slowing, down, customers, so, it, was, removed, fading, daylight, through, glass, panels, was, supplemented, by, gradually, increased, electric, lighting, making, it, seem, like, the, afternoon, was, lasting, longer, which, encouraged, shoppers, to, linger, in, the, united, states, in, the, mid, 1990s, malls, were, still, being, constructed, at, a, rate, of, 140, a, year, but, in, 2001, a, pricewaterhousecoopers, study, found, that, underperforming, and, vacant, malls, known, as, greyfield, and, dead, mall, estates, were, an, emerging, problem, in, 2007, a, year, before, the, great, recession, no, new, malls, were, built, in, america, for, the, first, time, in, 50, years, city, creek, center, mall, in, salt, lake, city, which, opened, in, march, 2012, was, the, first, to, be, built, since, the, recession, malls, began, to, lose, consumers, to, open, air, power, centers, and, lifestyle, centers, during, the, 1990s, as, consumers, preferred, to, park, right, in, front, of, and, walk, directly, into, big, box, stores, with, lower, prices, and, without, the, overhead, of, traditional, malls, i, e, long, enclosed, corridors, another, issue, was, that, the, growth, crazed, american, commercial, real, estate, industry, had, simply, built, too, many, nice, places, to, shop, far, more, than, could, be, reasonably, justified, by, the, actual, growth, of, the, american, population, retail, sales, or, any, other, economic, indicator, the, number, of, american, shopping, centers, exploded, from, 4, 500, in, 1960, to, 70, 000, by, 1986, to, just, under, 108, 000, by, 2010, thus, the, number, of, dead, malls, increased, significantly, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, economic, health, of, malls, across, the, united, states, has, been, in, decline, as, revealed, by, high, vacancy, rates, from, 2006, to, 2010, the, percentage, of, malls, that, are, considered, to, be, dying, by, real, estate, experts, have, a, vacancy, rate, of, at, least, 40, unhealthy, 20, 40, or, in, trouble, 10, 20, all, increased, greatly, and, these, high, vacancy, rates, only, partially, decreased, from, 2010, to, 2014, in, 2014, nearly, 3, of, all, malls, in, the, united, states, were, considered, to, be, dying, 40, or, higher, vacancy, rates, and, nearly, one, fifth, of, all, malls, had, vacancy, rates, considered, troubling, 10, or, higher, some, real, estate, experts, say, the, fundamental, problem, is, a, glut, of, malls, in, many, parts, of, the, country, creating, a, market, that, is, extremely, over, retailed, by, the, time, shopping, mall, operator, unibail, rodamco, westfield, decided, to, exit, the, american, market, in, 2022, the, united, states, had, an, average, of, 24, 5, square, feet, of, retail, space, per, capita, in, contrast, to, 4, 5, square, feet, per, capita, in, europe, in, 2019, the, shops, restaurants, at, hudson, yards, opened, as, an, upscale, mall, in, new, york, city, with, a, fifth, avenue, mix, of, shops, such, as, h, m, zara, and, sephora, below, them, this, is, one, of, the, first, two, malls, built, recently, along, with, american, dream, in, which, both, opened, in, 2019, since, city, creek, center, online, shopping, has, also, emerged, as, a, major, competitor, to, shopping, malls, in, the, united, states, online, shopping, has, accounted, for, an, increasing, share, of, total, retail, sales, in, 2013, roughly, 200, out, of, 1, 300, malls, across, the, united, states, were, going, out, of, business, to, combat, this, trend, developers, have, converted, malls, into, other, uses, including, attractions, such, as, parks, movie, theaters, gyms, and, even, fishing, lakes, in, the, united, states, the, 600, 000, square, foot, highland, mall, will, be, a, campus, for, austin, community, college, in, france, the, so, ouest, mall, outside, of, paris, was, designed, to, resemble, elegant, louis, xv, style, apartments, and, includes, 17, 000, square, metres, 180, 000, sq, ft, of, green, space, the, australian, mall, company, westfield, launched, an, online, mall, and, later, a, mobile, app, with, 150, stores, 3, 000, brands, and, over, 1, million, products, the, covid, 19, pandemic, also, significantly, impacted, the, retail, industry, government, regulations, temporarily, closed, malls, increased, entrance, controls, and, imposed, strict, public, sanitation, requirements, high, land, prices, in, populous, cities, have, led, to, the, concept, of, the, vertical, mall, in, which, space, allocated, to, retail, is, configured, over, a, number, of, stories, accessible, by, elevators, and, or, escalators, usually, both, linking, the, different, levels, of, the, mall, the, challenge, of, this, type, of, mall, is, to, overcome, the, natural, tendency, of, shoppers, to, move, horizontally, and, encourage, shoppers, to, move, upwards, and, downwards, the, concept, of, a, vertical, mall, was, originally, conceived, in, the, late, 1960s, by, the, mafco, company, former, shopping, center, development, division, of, marshall, field, co, the, water, tower, place, skyscraper, in, chicago, illinois, was, built, in, 1975, by, urban, retail, properties, it, contains, a, hotel, luxury, condominiums, and, office, space, and, sits, atop, a, block, long, base, containing, an, eight, level, atrium, style, retail, mall, that, fronts, on, the, magnificent, mile, vertical, malls, are, common, in, densely, populated, conurbations, in, east, and, southeast, asia, hong, kong, in, particular, has, numerous, examples, such, as, times, square, dragon, centre, apm, langham, place, isquare, hysan, place, and, the, one, a, vertical, mall, may, also, be, built, where, the, geography, prevents, building, outward, or, there, are, other, restrictions, on, construction, such, as, historic, buildings, or, significant, archeology, the, darwin, shopping, centre, and, associated, malls, in, shrewsbury, uk, are, built, on, the, side, of, a, steep, hill, around, the, former, town, walls, consequently, the, shopping, center, is, split, over, seven, floors, vertically, two, locations, horizontally, connected, by, elevators, escalators, and, bridge, walkways, some, establishments, incorporate, such, designs, into, their, layout, such, as, shrewsbury, s, former, mcdonald, s, split, into, four, stories, with, multiple, mezzanines, which, featured, medieval, castle, vaults, complete, with, arrowslits, in, the, basement, dining, rooms, a, common, feature, of, shopping, malls, is, a, food, court, this, typically, consists, of, a, number, of, fast, food, vendors, of, various, types, surrounding, a, shared, seating, area, when, the, shopping, mall, format, was, developed, by, victor, gruen, in, the, mid, 1950s, signing, larger, department, stores, was, necessary, for, the, financial, stability, of, the, projects, and, to, draw, retail, traffic, that, would, result, in, visits, to, the, smaller, stores, in, the, mall, as, well, these, larger, stores, are, termed, anchor, stores, or, draw, tenants, in, physical, configuration, anchor, stores, are, normally, located, as, far, from, each, other, as, possible, to, maximize, the, amount, of, traffic, from, one, anchor, to, another, there, are, a, reported, 222, malls, in, europe, in, 2014, these, malls, had, combined, sales, of, us, 12, 47, billion, this, represented, a, 10, bump, in, revenues, from, the, prior, year, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, both, open, air, and, enclosed, centers, are, commonly, referred, to, as, shopping, centres, mall, primarily, refers, to, either, a, shopping, mall, a, place, where, a, collection, of, shops, all, adjoin, a, pedestrian, area, or, an, exclusively, pedestrianized, street, that, allows, shoppers, to, walk, without, interference, from, vehicle, traffic, the, majority, of, british, enclosed, shopping, centres, the, equivalent, of, a, u, s, mall, are, located, in, city, centres, usually, found, in, old, and, historic, shopping, districts, and, surrounded, by, subsidiary, open, air, shopping, streets, large, examples, include, westquay, in, southampton, manchester, arndale, bullring, birmingham, liverpool, one, trinity, leeds, buchanan, galleries, in, glasgow, st, james, quarter, in, edinburgh, and, eldon, square, in, newcastle, upon, tyne, in, addition, to, the, inner, city, shopping, centres, large, uk, conurbations, will, also, have, large, out, of, town, regional, malls, such, as, the, metrocentre, in, gateshead, meadowhall, centre, sheffield, serving, south, yorkshire, the, trafford, centre, in, greater, manchester, white, rose, centre, in, leeds, the, merry, hill, centre, near, dudley, and, bluewater, in, kent, these, centres, were, built, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, but, planning, regulations, prohibit, the, construction, of, any, more, out, of, town, shopping, developments, in, the, uk, are, now, focused, on, retail, parks, which, consist, of, groups, of, warehouse, style, shops, with, individual, entrances, from, outdoors, planning, policy, prioritizes, the, development, of, existing, town, centres, although, with, patchy, success, westfield, london, white, city, is, the, largest, shopping, centre, in, europe, in, russia, on, the, other, hand, as, of, 2013, a, large, number, of, new, malls, had, been, built, near, major, cities, notably, the, mega, malls, such, as, mega, belaya, dacha, mall, near, moscow, in, large, part, they, were, financed, by, international, investors, and, were, popular, with, shoppers, from, the, emerging, middle, class, a, shopping, property, management, firm, is, a, company, that, specializes, in, owning, and, managing, shopping, malls, most, shopping, property, management, firms, own, at, least, 20, malls, some, firms, use, a, similar, naming, scheme, for, most, of, their, malls, for, example, mills, corporation, puts, mills, in, most, of, its, mall, names, and, sm, prime, holdings, of, the, philippines, puts, sm, in, all, of, its, malls, as, well, as, anchor, stores, such, as, the, sm, store, sm, appliance, center, sm, hypermarket, sm, cinema, and, sm, supermarket, in, the, uk, the, mall, fund, changes, the, name, of, any, center, it, buys, to, the, mall, location, using, its, pink, m, logo, when, it, sells, a, mall, the, center, reverts, to, its, own, name, and, branding, such, as, the, ashley, centre, in, epsom, similarly, following, its, rebranding, from, capital, shopping, centres, intu, properties, renamed, many, of, its, centres, to, intu, name, location, such, as, intu, lakeside, again, malls, removed, from, the, network, revert, to, their, own, brand, see, for, instance, the, glades, in, bromley, one, controversial, aspect, of, malls, has, been, their, effective, displacement, of, traditional, main, streets, or, high, streets, some, consumers, prefer, malls, with, their, parking, garages, controlled, environments, and, private, security, guards, over, central, business, districts, cbd, or, downtowns, which, frequently, have, limited, parking, poor, maintenance, outdoor, weather, and, limited, police, coverage, in, response, a, few, jurisdictions, notably, california, have, expanded, the, right, of, freedom, of, speech, to, ensure, that, speakers, will, be, able, to, reach, consumers, who, prefer, to, shop, eat, and, socialize, within, the, boundaries, of, privately, owned, malls, the, supreme, court, decision, pruneyard, shopping, center, v, robins, was, issued, on, 9, june, 1980, which, affirmed, the, decision, of, the, california, supreme, court, in, a, case, that, arose, out, of, a, free, speech, dispute, between, the, pruneyard, shopping, center, in, campbell, california, and, several, local, high, school, students, this, is, a, list, of, the, world, s, largest, shopping, malls, based, on, their, gross, leasable, area, gla, with, a, gla, of, at, least, 250, 000, m, 2, 2, 700, 000, sq, ft, some, wholesale, market, complexes, also, function, as, shopping, malls, in, that, they, contain, retail, space, which, operate, as, stores, in, normal, malls, do, but, also, act, as, producer, vendor, outlets, that, can, take, large, orders, for, export
