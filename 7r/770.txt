memory, is, the, faculty, of, the, mind, by, which, data, or, information, is, encoded, stored, and, retrieved, when, needed, it, is, the, retention, of, information, over, time, for, the, purpose, of, influencing, future, action, if, past, events, could, not, be, remembered, it, would, be, impossible, for, language, relationships, or, personal, identity, to, develop, memory, loss, is, usually, described, as, forgetfulness, or, amnesia, memory, is, often, understood, as, an, informational, processing, system, with, explicit, and, implicit, functioning, that, is, made, up, of, a, sensory, processor, short, term, or, working, memory, and, long, term, memory, this, can, be, related, to, the, neuron, the, sensory, processor, allows, information, from, the, outside, world, to, be, sensed, in, the, form, of, chemical, and, physical, stimuli, and, attended, to, various, levels, of, focus, and, intent, working, memory, serves, as, an, encoding, and, retrieval, processor, information, in, the, form, of, stimuli, is, encoded, in, accordance, with, explicit, or, implicit, functions, by, the, working, memory, processor, the, working, memory, also, retrieves, information, from, previously, stored, material, finally, the, function, of, long, term, memory, is, to, store, through, various, categorical, models, or, systems, declarative, or, explicit, memory, is, the, conscious, storage, and, recollection, of, data, under, declarative, memory, resides, semantic, and, episodic, memory, semantic, memory, refers, to, memory, that, is, encoded, with, specific, meaning, meanwhile, episodic, memory, refers, to, information, that, is, encoded, along, a, spatial, and, temporal, plane, declarative, memory, is, usually, the, primary, process, thought, of, when, referencing, memory, non, declarative, or, implicit, memory, is, the, unconscious, storage, and, recollection, of, information, an, example, of, a, non, declarative, process, would, be, the, unconscious, learning, or, retrieval, of, information, by, way, of, procedural, memory, or, a, priming, phenomenon, priming, is, the, process, of, subliminally, arousing, specific, responses, from, memory, and, shows, that, not, all, memory, is, consciously, activated, whereas, procedural, memory, is, the, slow, and, gradual, learning, of, skills, that, often, occurs, without, conscious, attention, to, learning, memory, is, not, a, perfect, processor, and, is, affected, by, many, factors, the, ways, by, which, information, is, encoded, stored, and, retrieved, can, all, be, corrupted, pain, for, example, has, been, identified, as, a, physical, condition, that, impairs, memory, and, has, been, noted, in, animal, models, as, well, as, chronic, pain, patients, the, amount, of, attention, given, new, stimuli, can, diminish, the, amount, of, information, that, becomes, encoded, for, storage, also, the, storage, process, can, become, corrupted, by, physical, damage, to, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, associated, with, memory, storage, such, as, the, hippocampus, finally, the, retrieval, of, information, from, long, term, memory, can, be, disrupted, because, of, decay, within, long, term, memory, normal, functioning, decay, over, time, and, brain, damage, all, affect, the, accuracy, and, capacity, of, the, memory, sensory, memory, holds, information, derived, from, the, senses, less, than, one, second, after, an, item, is, perceived, the, ability, to, look, at, an, item, and, remember, what, it, looked, like, with, just, a, split, second, of, observation, or, memorization, is, an, example, of, sensory, memory, it, is, out, of, cognitive, control, and, is, an, automatic, response, with, very, short, presentations, participants, often, report, that, they, seem, to, see, more, than, they, can, actually, report, the, first, precise, experiments, exploring, this, form, of, sensory, memory, were, conducted, by, george, sperling, 1963, using, the, partial, report, paradigm, subjects, were, presented, with, a, grid, of, 12, letters, arranged, into, three, rows, of, four, after, a, brief, presentation, subjects, were, then, played, either, a, high, medium, or, low, tone, cuing, them, which, of, the, rows, to, report, based, on, these, partial, report, experiments, sperling, was, able, to, show, that, the, capacity, of, sensory, memory, was, approximately, 12, items, but, that, it, degraded, very, quickly, within, a, few, hundred, milliseconds, because, this, form, of, memory, degrades, so, quickly, participants, would, see, the, display, but, be, unable, to, report, all, of, the, items, 12, in, the, whole, report, procedure, before, they, decayed, this, type, of, memory, cannot, be, prolonged, via, rehearsal, three, types, of, sensory, memories, exist, iconic, memory, is, a, fast, decaying, store, of, visual, information, a, type, of, sensory, memory, that, briefly, stores, an, image, that, has, been, perceived, for, a, small, duration, echoic, memory, is, a, fast, decaying, store, of, auditory, information, also, a, sensory, memory, that, briefly, stores, sounds, that, have, been, perceived, for, short, durations, haptic, memory, is, a, type, of, sensory, memory, that, represents, a, database, for, touch, stimuli, short, term, memory, not, to, be, confused, with, working, memory, allows, recall, for, a, period, of, several, seconds, to, a, minute, without, rehearsal, its, capacity, however, is, very, limited, in, 1956, george, a, miller, 1920, 2012, when, working, at, bell, laboratories, conducted, experiments, showing, that, the, store, of, short, term, memory, was, 7, 2, items, hence, the, title, of, his, famous, paper, the, magical, number, 7, 2, modern, perspectives, estimate, the, capacity, of, short, term, memory, to, be, lower, typically, on, the, order, of, 4, 5, items, or, argue, for, a, more, flexible, limit, based, on, information, instead, of, items, memory, capacity, can, be, increased, through, a, process, called, chunking, for, example, in, recalling, a, ten, digit, telephone, number, a, person, could, chunk, the, digits, into, three, groups, first, the, area, code, such, as, 123, then, a, three, digit, chunk, 456, and, last, a, four, digit, chunk, 7890, this, method, of, remembering, telephone, numbers, is, far, more, effective, than, attempting, to, remember, a, string, of, 10, digits, this, is, because, we, are, able, to, chunk, the, information, into, meaningful, groups, of, numbers, this, is, reflected, in, some, countries, tendencies, to, display, telephone, numbers, as, several, chunks, of, two, to, four, numbers, short, term, memory, is, believed, to, rely, mostly, on, an, acoustic, code, for, storing, information, and, to, a, lesser, extent, on, a, visual, code, conrad, 1964, found, that, test, subjects, had, more, difficulty, recalling, collections, of, letters, that, were, acoustically, similar, e, g, e, p, d, confusion, with, recalling, acoustically, similar, letters, rather, than, visually, similar, letters, implies, that, the, letters, were, encoded, acoustically, conrad, s, 1964, study, however, deals, with, the, encoding, of, written, text, thus, while, the, memory, of, written, language, may, rely, on, acoustic, components, generalizations, to, all, forms, of, memory, cannot, be, made, the, storage, in, sensory, memory, and, short, term, memory, generally, has, a, strictly, limited, capacity, and, duration, this, means, that, information, is, not, retained, indefinitely, by, contrast, while, the, total, capacity, of, long, term, memory, has, yet, to, be, established, it, can, store, much, larger, quantities, of, information, furthermore, it, can, store, this, information, for, a, much, longer, duration, potentially, for, a, whole, life, span, for, example, given, a, random, seven, digit, number, one, may, remember, it, for, only, a, few, seconds, before, forgetting, suggesting, it, was, stored, in, short, term, memory, on, the, other, hand, one, can, remember, telephone, numbers, for, many, years, through, repetition, this, information, is, said, to, be, stored, in, long, term, memory, while, short, term, memory, encodes, information, acoustically, long, term, memory, encodes, it, semantically, baddeley, 1966, discovered, that, after, 20, minutes, test, subjects, had, the, most, difficulty, recalling, a, collection, of, words, that, had, similar, meanings, e, g, big, large, great, huge, long, term, another, part, of, long, term, memory, is, episodic, memory, which, attempts, to, capture, information, such, as, what, when, and, where, with, episodic, memory, individuals, are, able, to, recall, specific, events, such, as, birthday, parties, and, weddings, short, term, memory, is, supported, by, transient, patterns, of, neuronal, communication, dependent, on, regions, of, the, frontal, lobe, especially, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, and, the, parietal, lobe, long, term, memory, on, the, other, hand, is, maintained, by, more, stable, and, permanent, changes, in, neural, connections, widely, spread, throughout, the, brain, the, hippocampus, is, essential, for, learning, new, information, to, the, consolidation, of, information, from, short, term, to, long, term, memory, although, it, does, not, seem, to, store, information, itself, it, was, thought, that, without, the, hippocampus, new, memories, were, unable, to, be, stored, into, long, term, memory, and, that, there, would, be, a, very, short, attention, span, as, first, gleaned, from, patient, henry, molaison, after, what, was, thought, to, be, the, full, removal, of, both, his, hippocampi, more, recent, examination, of, his, brain, post, mortem, shows, that, the, hippocampus, was, more, intact, than, first, thought, throwing, theories, drawn, from, the, initial, data, into, question, the, hippocampus, may, be, involved, in, changing, neural, connections, for, a, period, of, three, months, or, more, after, the, initial, learning, research, has, suggested, that, long, term, memory, storage, in, humans, may, be, maintained, by, dna, methylation, and, the, prion, gene, further, research, investigated, the, molecular, basis, for, long, term, memory, by, 2015, it, had, become, clear, that, long, term, memory, requires, gene, transcription, activation, and, de, novo, protein, synthesis, long, term, memory, formation, depends, on, both, the, activation, of, memory, promoting, genes, and, the, inhibition, of, memory, suppressor, genes, and, dna, methylation, dna, demethylation, was, found, to, be, a, major, mechanism, for, achieving, this, dual, regulation, rats, with, a, new, strong, long, term, memory, due, to, contextual, fear, conditioning, have, reduced, expression, of, about, 1, 000, genes, and, increased, expression, of, about, 500, genes, in, the, hippocampus, 24, hours, after, training, thus, exhibiting, modified, expression, of, 9, 17, of, the, rat, hippocampal, genome, reduced, gene, expressions, were, associated, with, methylations, of, those, genes, considerable, further, research, into, long, term, memory, has, illuminated, the, molecular, mechanisms, by, which, methylations, are, established, or, removed, as, reviewed, in, 2022, these, mechanisms, include, for, instance, signal, responsive, top2b, induced, double, strand, breaks, in, immediate, early, genes, also, the, messenger, rnas, of, many, genes, that, had, been, subjected, to, methylation, controlled, increases, or, decreases, are, transported, by, neural, granules, messenger, rnp, to, the, dendritic, spines, at, these, locations, the, messenger, rnas, can, be, translated, into, the, proteins, that, control, signaling, at, neuronal, synapses, the, multi, store, model, also, known, as, atkinson, shiffrin, memory, model, was, first, described, in, 1968, by, atkinson, and, shiffrin, the, multi, store, model, has, been, criticised, for, being, too, simplistic, for, instance, long, term, memory, is, believed, to, be, actually, made, up, of, multiple, subcomponents, such, as, episodic, and, procedural, memory, it, also, proposes, that, rehearsal, is, the, only, mechanism, by, which, information, eventually, reaches, long, term, storage, but, evidence, shows, us, capable, of, remembering, things, without, rehearsal, the, model, also, shows, all, the, memory, stores, as, being, a, single, unit, whereas, research, into, this, shows, differently, for, example, short, term, memory, can, be, broken, up, into, different, units, such, as, visual, information, and, acoustic, information, in, a, study, by, zlonoga, and, gerber, 1986, patient, kf, demonstrated, certain, deviations, from, the, atkinson, shiffrin, model, patient, kf, was, brain, damaged, displaying, difficulties, regarding, short, term, memory, recognition, of, sounds, such, as, spoken, numbers, letters, words, and, easily, identifiable, noises, such, as, doorbells, and, cats, meowing, were, all, impacted, visual, short, term, memory, was, unaffected, suggesting, a, dichotomy, between, visual, and, audial, memory, in, 1974, baddeley, and, hitch, proposed, a, working, memory, model, that, replaced, the, general, concept, of, short, term, memory, with, active, maintenance, of, information, in, short, term, storage, in, this, model, working, memory, consists, of, three, basic, stores, the, central, executive, the, phonological, loop, and, the, visuo, spatial, sketchpad, in, 2000, this, model, was, expanded, with, the, multimodal, episodic, buffer, baddeley, s, model, of, working, memory, the, central, executive, essentially, acts, as, an, attention, sensory, store, it, channels, information, to, the, three, component, processes, the, phonological, loop, the, visuospatial, sketchpad, and, the, episodic, buffer, the, phonological, loop, stores, auditory, information, by, silently, rehearsing, sounds, or, words, in, a, continuous, loop, the, articulatory, process, for, example, the, repetition, of, a, telephone, number, over, and, over, again, a, short, list, of, data, is, easier, to, remember, the, phonological, loop, is, occasionally, disrupted, irrelevant, speech, or, background, noise, can, impede, the, phonological, loop, articulatory, suppression, can, also, confuse, encoding, and, words, that, sound, similar, can, be, switched, or, misremembered, through, the, phonological, similarity, effect, the, phonological, loop, also, has, a, limit, to, how, much, it, can, hold, at, once, which, means, that, it, is, easier, to, remember, a, lot, of, short, words, rather, than, a, lot, of, long, words, according, to, the, word, length, effect, the, visuospatial, sketchpad, stores, visual, and, spatial, information, it, is, engaged, when, performing, spatial, tasks, such, as, judging, distances, or, visual, ones, such, as, counting, the, windows, on, a, house, or, imagining, images, those, with, aphantasia, will, not, be, able, to, engage, the, visuospatial, sketchpad, the, episodic, buffer, is, dedicated, to, linking, information, across, domains, to, form, integrated, units, of, visual, spatial, and, verbal, information, and, chronological, ordering, e, g, the, memory, of, a, story, or, a, movie, scene, the, episodic, buffer, is, also, assumed, to, have, links, to, long, term, memory, and, semantic, meaning, the, working, memory, model, explains, many, practical, observations, such, as, why, it, is, easier, to, do, two, different, tasks, one, verbal, and, one, visual, than, two, similar, tasks, and, the, aforementioned, word, length, effect, working, memory, is, also, the, premise, for, what, allows, us, to, do, everyday, activities, involving, thought, it, is, the, section, of, memory, where, we, carry, out, thought, processes, and, use, them, to, learn, and, reason, about, topics, researchers, distinguish, between, recognition, and, recall, memory, recognition, memory, tasks, require, individuals, to, indicate, whether, they, have, encountered, a, stimulus, such, as, a, picture, or, a, word, before, recall, memory, tasks, require, participants, to, retrieve, previously, learned, information, for, example, individuals, might, be, asked, to, produce, a, series, of, actions, they, have, seen, before, or, to, say, a, list, of, words, they, have, heard, before, topographical, memory, involves, the, ability, to, orient, oneself, in, space, to, recognize, and, follow, an, itinerary, or, to, recognize, familiar, places, getting, lost, when, traveling, alone, is, an, example, of, the, failure, of, topographic, memory, flashbulb, memories, are, clear, episodic, memories, of, unique, and, highly, emotional, events, people, remembering, where, they, were, or, what, they, were, doing, when, they, first, heard, the, news, of, president, kennedy, s, assassination, the, sydney, siege, or, of, 9, 11, are, examples, of, flashbulb, memories, anderson, 1976, divides, long, term, memory, into, declarative, explicit, and, procedural, implicit, memories, declarative, memory, requires, conscious, recall, in, that, some, conscious, process, must, call, back, the, information, it, is, sometimes, called, explicit, memory, since, it, consists, of, information, that, is, explicitly, stored, and, retrieved, declarative, memory, can, be, further, sub, divided, into, semantic, memory, concerning, principles, and, facts, taken, independent, of, context, and, episodic, memory, concerning, information, specific, to, a, particular, context, such, as, a, time, and, place, semantic, memory, allows, the, encoding, of, abstract, knowledge, about, the, world, such, as, paris, is, the, capital, of, france, episodic, memory, on, the, other, hand, is, used, for, more, personal, memories, such, as, the, sensations, emotions, and, personal, associations, of, a, particular, place, or, time, episodic, memories, often, reflect, the, firsts, in, life, such, as, a, first, kiss, first, day, of, school, or, first, time, winning, a, championship, these, are, key, events, in, one, s, life, that, can, be, remembered, clearly, research, suggests, that, declarative, memory, is, supported, by, several, functions, of, the, medial, temporal, lobe, system, which, includes, the, hippocampus, autobiographical, memory, memory, for, particular, events, within, one, s, own, life, is, generally, viewed, as, either, equivalent, to, or, a, subset, of, episodic, memory, visual, memory, is, part, of, memory, preserving, some, characteristics, of, our, senses, pertaining, to, visual, experience, one, is, able, to, place, in, memory, information, that, resembles, objects, places, animals, or, people, in, sort, of, a, mental, image, visual, memory, can, result, in, priming, and, it, is, assumed, some, kind, of, perceptual, representational, system, underlies, this, phenomenon, in, contrast, procedural, memory, or, implicit, memory, is, not, based, on, the, conscious, recall, of, information, but, on, implicit, learning, it, can, best, be, summarized, as, remembering, how, to, do, something, procedural, memory, is, primarily, used, in, learning, motor, skills, and, can, be, considered, a, subset, of, implicit, memory, it, is, revealed, when, one, does, better, in, a, given, task, due, only, to, repetition, no, new, explicit, memories, have, been, formed, but, one, is, unconsciously, accessing, aspects, of, those, previous, experiences, procedural, memory, involved, in, motor, learning, depends, on, the, cerebellum, and, basal, ganglia, a, characteristic, of, procedural, memory, is, that, the, things, remembered, are, automatically, translated, into, actions, and, thus, sometimes, difficult, to, describe, some, examples, of, procedural, memory, include, the, ability, to, ride, a, bike, or, tie, shoelaces, another, major, way, to, distinguish, different, memory, functions, is, whether, the, content, to, be, remembered, is, in, the, past, retrospective, memory, or, in, the, future, prospective, memory, john, meacham, introduced, this, distinction, in, a, paper, presented, at, the, 1975, american, psychological, association, annual, meeting, and, subsequently, included, by, ulric, neisser, in, his, 1982, edited, volume, memory, observed, remembering, in, natural, contexts, thus, retrospective, memory, as, a, category, includes, semantic, episodic, and, autobiographical, memory, in, contrast, prospective, memory, is, memory, for, future, intentions, or, remembering, to, remember, winograd, 1988, prospective, memory, can, be, further, broken, down, into, event, and, time, based, prospective, remembering, time, based, prospective, memories, are, triggered, by, a, time, cue, such, as, going, to, the, doctor, action, at, 4pm, cue, event, based, prospective, memories, are, intentions, triggered, by, cues, such, as, remembering, to, post, a, letter, action, after, seeing, a, mailbox, cue, cues, do, not, need, to, be, related, to, the, action, as, the, mailbox, letter, example, and, lists, sticky, notes, knotted, handkerchiefs, or, string, around, the, finger, all, exemplify, cues, that, people, use, as, strategies, to, enhance, prospective, memory, infants, do, not, have, the, language, ability, to, report, on, their, memories, and, so, verbal, reports, cannot, be, used, to, assess, very, young, children, s, memory, throughout, the, years, however, researchers, have, adapted, and, developed, a, number, of, measures, for, assessing, both, infants, recognition, memory, and, their, recall, memory, habituation, and, operant, conditioning, techniques, have, been, used, to, assess, infants, recognition, memory, and, the, deferred, and, elicited, imitation, techniques, have, been, used, to, assess, infants, recall, memory, techniques, used, to, assess, infants, recognition, memory, include, the, following, techniques, used, to, assess, infants, recall, memory, include, the, following, researchers, use, a, variety, of, tasks, to, assess, older, children, and, adults, memory, some, examples, are, brain, areas, involved, in, the, neuroanatomy, of, memory, such, as, the, hippocampus, the, amygdala, the, striatum, or, the, mammillary, bodies, are, thought, to, be, involved, in, specific, types, of, memory, for, example, the, hippocampus, is, believed, to, be, involved, in, spatial, learning, and, declarative, learning, while, the, amygdala, is, thought, to, be, involved, in, emotional, memory, damage, to, certain, areas, in, patients, and, animal, models, and, subsequent, memory, deficits, is, a, primary, source, of, information, however, rather, than, implicating, a, specific, area, it, could, be, that, damage, to, adjacent, areas, or, to, a, pathway, traveling, through, the, area, is, actually, responsible, for, the, observed, deficit, further, it, is, not, sufficient, to, describe, memory, and, its, counterpart, learning, as, solely, dependent, on, specific, brain, regions, learning, and, memory, are, usually, attributed, to, changes, in, neuronal, synapses, thought, to, be, mediated, by, long, term, potentiation, and, long, term, depression, in, general, the, more, emotionally, charged, an, event, or, experience, is, the, better, it, is, remembered, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, the, memory, enhancement, effect, patients, with, amygdala, damage, however, do, not, show, a, memory, enhancement, effect, hebb, distinguished, between, short, term, and, long, term, memory, he, postulated, that, any, memory, that, stayed, in, short, term, storage, for, a, long, enough, time, would, be, consolidated, into, a, long, term, memory, later, research, showed, this, to, be, false, research, has, shown, that, direct, injections, of, cortisol, or, epinephrine, help, the, storage, of, recent, experiences, this, is, also, true, for, stimulation, of, the, amygdala, this, proves, that, excitement, enhances, memory, by, the, stimulation, of, hormones, that, affect, the, amygdala, excessive, or, prolonged, stress, with, prolonged, cortisol, may, hurt, memory, storage, patients, with, amygdalar, damage, are, no, more, likely, to, remember, emotionally, charged, words, than, nonemotionally, charged, ones, the, hippocampus, is, important, for, explicit, memory, the, hippocampus, is, also, important, for, memory, consolidation, the, hippocampus, receives, input, from, different, parts, of, the, cortex, and, sends, its, output, out, to, different, parts, of, the, brain, also, the, input, comes, from, secondary, and, tertiary, sensory, areas, that, have, processed, the, information, a, lot, already, hippocampal, damage, may, also, cause, memory, loss, and, problems, with, memory, storage, this, memory, loss, includes, retrograde, amnesia, which, is, the, loss, of, memory, for, events, that, occurred, shortly, before, the, time, of, brain, damage, cognitive, neuroscientists, consider, memory, as, the, retention, reactivation, and, reconstruction, of, the, experience, independent, internal, representation, the, term, of, internal, representation, implies, that, such, a, definition, of, memory, contains, two, components, the, expression, of, memory, at, the, behavioral, or, conscious, level, and, the, underpinning, physical, neural, changes, dudai, 2007, the, latter, component, is, also, called, engram, or, memory, traces, semon, 1904, some, neuroscientists, and, psychologists, mistakenly, equate, the, concept, of, engram, and, memory, broadly, conceiving, all, persisting, after, effects, of, experiences, as, memory, others, argue, against, this, notion, that, memory, does, not, exist, until, it, is, revealed, in, behavior, or, thought, moscovitch, 2007, one, question, that, is, crucial, in, cognitive, neuroscience, is, how, information, and, mental, experiences, are, coded, and, represented, in, the, brain, scientists, have, gained, much, knowledge, about, the, neuronal, codes, from, the, studies, of, plasticity, but, most, of, such, research, has, been, focused, on, simple, learning, in, simple, neuronal, circuits, it, is, considerably, less, clear, about, the, neuronal, changes, involved, in, more, complex, examples, of, memory, particularly, declarative, memory, that, requires, the, storage, of, facts, and, events, byrne, 2007, convergence, divergence, zones, might, be, the, neural, networks, where, memories, are, stored, and, retrieved, considering, that, there, are, several, kinds, of, memory, depending, on, types, of, represented, knowledge, underlying, mechanisms, processes, functions, and, modes, of, acquisition, it, is, likely, that, different, brain, areas, support, different, memory, systems, and, that, they, are, in, mutual, relationships, in, neuronal, networks, components, of, memory, representation, are, distributed, widely, across, different, parts, of, the, brain, as, mediated, by, multiple, neocortical, circuits, study, of, the, genetics, of, human, memory, is, in, its, infancy, though, many, genes, have, been, investigated, for, their, association, to, memory, in, humans, and, non, human, animals, a, notable, initial, success, was, the, association, of, apoe, with, memory, dysfunction, in, alzheimer, s, disease, the, search, for, genes, associated, with, normally, varying, memory, continues, one, of, the, first, candidates, for, normal, variation, in, memory, is, the, protein, kibra, which, appears, to, be, associated, with, the, rate, at, which, material, is, forgotten, over, a, delay, period, there, has, been, some, evidence, that, memories, are, stored, in, the, nucleus, of, neurons, several, genes, proteins, and, enzymes, have, been, extensively, researched, for, their, association, with, memory, long, term, memory, unlike, short, term, memory, is, dependent, upon, the, synthesis, of, new, proteins, this, occurs, within, the, cellular, body, and, concerns, the, particular, transmitters, receptors, and, new, synapse, pathways, that, reinforce, the, communicative, strength, between, neurons, the, production, of, new, proteins, devoted, to, synapse, reinforcement, is, triggered, after, the, release, of, certain, signaling, substances, such, as, calcium, within, hippocampal, neurons, in, the, cell, in, the, case, of, hippocampal, cells, this, release, is, dependent, upon, the, expulsion, of, magnesium, a, binding, molecule, that, is, expelled, after, significant, and, repetitive, synaptic, signaling, the, temporary, expulsion, of, magnesium, frees, nmda, receptors, to, release, calcium, in, the, cell, a, signal, that, leads, to, gene, transcription, and, the, construction, of, reinforcing, proteins, for, more, information, see, long, term, potentiation, ltp, one, of, the, newly, synthesized, proteins, in, ltp, is, also, critical, for, maintaining, long, term, memory, this, protein, is, an, autonomously, active, form, of, the, enzyme, protein, kinase, c, pkc, known, as, pkm, pkm, maintains, the, activity, dependent, enhancement, of, synaptic, strength, and, inhibiting, pkm, erases, established, long, term, memories, without, affecting, short, term, memory, or, once, the, inhibitor, is, eliminated, the, ability, to, encode, and, store, new, long, term, memories, is, restored, also, bdnf, is, important, for, the, persistence, of, long, term, memories, the, long, term, stabilization, of, synaptic, changes, is, also, determined, by, a, parallel, increase, of, pre, and, postsynaptic, structures, such, as, axonal, bouton, dendritic, spine, and, postsynaptic, density, on, the, molecular, level, an, increase, of, the, postsynaptic, scaffolding, proteins, psd, 95, and, homer1c, has, been, shown, to, correlate, with, the, stabilization, of, synaptic, enlargement, the, camp, response, element, binding, protein, creb, is, a, transcription, factor, which, is, believed, to, be, important, in, consolidating, short, term, to, long, term, memories, and, which, is, believed, to, be, downregulated, in, alzheimer, s, disease, rats, exposed, to, an, intense, learning, event, may, retain, a, life, long, memory, of, the, event, even, after, a, single, training, session, the, long, term, memory, of, such, an, event, appears, to, be, initially, stored, in, the, hippocampus, but, this, storage, is, transient, much, of, the, long, term, storage, of, the, memory, seems, to, take, place, in, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, when, such, an, exposure, was, experimentally, applied, more, than, 5, 000, differently, methylated, dna, regions, appeared, in, the, hippocampus, neuronal, genome, of, the, rats, at, one, and, at, 24, hours, after, training, these, alterations, in, methylation, pattern, occurred, at, many, genes, that, were, downregulated, often, due, to, the, formation, of, new, 5, methylcytosine, sites, in, cpg, rich, regions, of, the, genome, furthermore, many, other, genes, were, upregulated, likely, often, due, to, hypomethylation, hypomethylation, often, results, from, the, removal, of, methyl, groups, from, previously, existing, 5, methylcytosines, in, dna, demethylation, is, carried, out, by, several, proteins, acting, in, concert, including, the, tet, enzymes, as, well, as, enzymes, of, the, dna, base, excision, repair, pathway, see, epigenetics, in, learning, and, memory, the, pattern, of, induced, and, repressed, genes, in, brain, neurons, subsequent, to, an, intense, learning, event, likely, provides, the, molecular, basis, for, a, long, term, memory, of, the, event, studies, of, the, molecular, basis, for, memory, formation, indicate, that, epigenetic, mechanisms, operating, in, neurons, in, the, brain, play, a, central, role, in, determining, this, capability, key, epigenetic, mechanisms, involved, in, memory, include, the, methylation, and, demethylation, of, neuronal, dna, as, well, as, modifications, of, histone, proteins, including, methylations, acetylations, and, deacetylations, stimulation, of, brain, activity, in, memory, formation, is, often, accompanied, by, the, generation, of, damage, in, neuronal, dna, that, is, followed, by, repair, associated, with, persistent, epigenetic, alterations, in, particular, the, dna, repair, processes, of, non, homologous, end, joining, and, base, excision, repair, are, employed, in, memory, formation, during, a, new, learning, experience, a, set, of, genes, is, rapidly, expressed, in, the, brain, this, induced, gene, expression, is, considered, to, be, essential, for, processing, the, information, being, learned, such, genes, are, referred, to, as, immediate, early, genes, iegs, dna, topoisomerase, 2, beta, top2b, activity, is, essential, for, the, expression, of, iegs, in, a, type, of, learning, experience, in, mice, termed, associative, fear, memory, such, a, learning, experience, appears, to, rapidly, trigger, top2b, to, induce, double, strand, breaks, in, the, promoter, dna, of, ieg, genes, that, function, in, neuroplasticity, repair, of, these, induced, breaks, is, associated, with, dna, demethylation, of, ieg, gene, promoters, allowing, immediate, expression, of, these, ieg, genes, the, double, strand, breaks, that, are, induced, during, a, learning, experience, are, not, immediately, repaired, about, 600, regulatory, sequences, in, promoters, and, about, 800, regulatory, sequences, in, enhancers, appear, to, depend, on, double, strand, breaks, initiated, by, topoisomerase, 2, beta, top2b, for, activation, the, induction, of, particular, double, strand, breaks, are, specific, with, respect, to, their, inducing, signal, when, neurons, are, activated, in, vitro, just, 22, of, top2b, induced, double, strand, breaks, occur, in, their, genomes, such, top2b, induced, double, strand, breaks, are, accompanied, by, at, least, four, enzymes, of, the, non, homologous, end, joining, nhej, dna, repair, pathway, dna, pkcs, ku70, ku80, and, dna, ligase, iv, see, figure, these, enzymes, repair, the, double, strand, breaks, within, about, 15, minutes, to, two, hours, the, double, strand, breaks, in, the, promoter, are, thus, associated, with, top2b, and, at, least, these, four, repair, enzymes, these, proteins, are, present, simultaneously, on, a, single, promoter, nucleosome, there, are, about, 147, nucleotides, in, the, dna, sequence, wrapped, around, a, single, nucleosome, located, near, the, transcription, start, site, of, their, target, gene, the, double, strand, break, introduced, by, top2b, apparently, frees, the, part, of, the, promoter, at, an, rna, polymerase, bound, transcription, start, site, to, physically, move, to, its, associated, enhancer, see, regulatory, sequence, this, allows, the, enhancer, with, its, bound, transcription, factors, and, mediator, proteins, to, directly, interact, with, the, rna, polymerase, paused, at, the, transcription, start, site, to, start, transcription, contextual, fear, conditioning, in, the, mouse, causes, the, mouse, to, have, a, long, term, memory, and, fear, of, the, location, in, which, it, occurred, contextual, fear, conditioning, causes, hundreds, of, dsbs, in, mouse, brain, medial, prefrontal, cortex, mpfc, and, hippocampus, neurons, see, figure, brain, regions, involved, in, memory, formation, these, dsbs, predominately, activate, genes, involved, in, synaptic, processes, that, are, important, for, learning, and, memory, up, until, the, mid, 1980s, it, was, assumed, that, infants, could, not, encode, retain, and, retrieve, information, a, growing, body, of, research, now, indicates, that, infants, as, young, as, 6, months, can, recall, information, after, a, 24, hour, delay, furthermore, research, has, revealed, that, as, infants, grow, older, they, can, store, information, for, longer, periods, of, time, 6, month, olds, can, recall, information, after, a, 24, hour, period, 9, month, olds, after, up, to, five, weeks, and, 20, month, olds, after, as, long, as, twelve, months, in, addition, studies, have, shown, that, with, age, infants, can, store, information, faster, whereas, 14, month, olds, can, recall, a, three, step, sequence, after, being, exposed, to, it, once, 6, month, olds, need, approximately, six, exposures, in, order, to, be, able, to, remember, it, although, 6, month, olds, can, recall, information, over, the, short, term, they, have, difficulty, recalling, the, temporal, order, of, information, it, is, only, by, 9, months, of, age, that, infants, can, recall, the, actions, of, a, two, step, sequence, in, the, correct, temporal, order, that, is, recalling, step, 1, and, then, step, 2, in, other, words, when, asked, to, imitate, a, two, step, action, sequence, such, as, putting, a, toy, car, in, the, base, and, pushing, in, the, plunger, to, make, the, toy, roll, to, the, other, end, 9, month, olds, tend, to, imitate, the, actions, of, the, sequence, in, the, correct, order, step, 1, and, then, step, 2, younger, infants, 6, month, olds, can, only, recall, one, step, of, a, two, step, sequence, researchers, have, suggested, that, these, age, differences, are, probably, due, to, the, fact, that, the, dentate, gyrus, of, the, hippocampus, and, the, frontal, components, of, the, neural, network, are, not, fully, developed, at, the, age, of, 6, months, in, fact, the, term, infantile, amnesia, refers, to, the, phenomenon, of, accelerated, forgetting, during, infancy, importantly, infantile, amnesia, is, not, unique, to, humans, and, preclinical, research, using, rodent, models, provides, insight, into, the, precise, neurobiology, of, this, phenomenon, a, review, of, the, literature, from, behavioral, neuroscientist, jee, hyun, kim, suggests, that, accelerated, forgetting, during, early, life, is, at, least, partly, due, to, rapid, growth, of, the, brain, during, this, period, one, of, the, key, concerns, of, older, adults, is, the, experience, of, memory, loss, especially, as, it, is, one, of, the, hallmark, symptoms, of, alzheimer, s, disease, however, memory, loss, is, qualitatively, different, in, normal, aging, from, the, kind, of, memory, loss, associated, with, a, diagnosis, of, alzheimer, s, budson, price, 2005, research, has, revealed, that, individuals, performance, on, memory, tasks, that, rely, on, frontal, regions, declines, with, age, older, adults, tend, to, exhibit, deficits, on, tasks, that, involve, knowing, the, temporal, order, in, which, they, learned, information, source, memory, tasks, that, require, them, to, remember, the, specific, circumstances, or, context, in, which, they, learned, information, and, prospective, memory, tasks, that, involve, remembering, to, perform, an, act, at, a, future, time, older, adults, can, manage, their, problems, with, prospective, memory, by, using, appointment, books, for, example, gene, transcription, profiles, were, determined, for, the, human, frontal, cortex, of, individuals, from, age, 26, to, 106, years, numerous, genes, were, identified, with, reduced, expression, after, age, 40, and, especially, after, age, 70, genes, that, play, central, roles, in, memory, and, learning, were, among, those, showing, the, most, significant, reduction, with, age, there, was, also, a, marked, increase, in, dna, damage, likely, oxidative, damage, in, the, promoters, of, those, genes, with, reduced, expression, it, was, suggested, that, dna, damage, may, reduce, the, expression, of, selectively, vulnerable, genes, involved, in, memory, and, learning, much, of, the, current, knowledge, of, memory, has, come, from, studying, memory, disorders, particularly, loss, of, memory, known, as, amnesia, amnesia, can, result, from, extensive, damage, to, a, the, regions, of, the, medial, temporal, lobe, such, as, the, hippocampus, dentate, gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the, parahippocampal, entorhinal, and, perirhinal, cortices, or, the, b, midline, diencephalic, region, specifically, the, dorsomedial, nucleus, of, the, thalamus, and, the, mammillary, bodies, of, the, hypothalamus, there, are, many, sorts, of, amnesia, and, by, studying, their, different, forms, it, has, become, possible, to, observe, apparent, defects, in, individual, sub, systems, of, the, brain, s, memory, systems, and, thus, hypothesize, their, function, in, the, normally, working, brain, other, neurological, disorders, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, and, parkinson, s, disease, can, also, affect, memory, and, cognition, hyperthymesia, or, hyperthymesic, syndrome, is, a, disorder, that, affects, an, individual, s, autobiographical, memory, essentially, meaning, that, they, cannot, forget, small, details, that, otherwise, would, not, be, stored, korsakoff, s, syndrome, also, known, as, korsakoff, s, psychosis, amnesic, confabulatory, syndrome, is, an, organic, brain, disease, that, adversely, affects, memory, by, widespread, loss, or, shrinkage, of, neurons, within, the, prefrontal, cortex, while, not, a, disorder, a, common, temporary, failure, of, word, retrieval, from, memory, is, the, tip, of, the, tongue, phenomenon, those, with, anomic, aphasia, also, called, nominal, aphasia, or, anomia, however, do, experience, the, tip, of, the, tongue, phenomenon, on, an, ongoing, basis, due, to, damage, to, the, frontal, and, parietal, lobes, of, the, brain, memory, dysfunction, can, also, occur, after, viral, infections, many, patients, recovering, from, covid, 19, experience, memory, lapses, other, viruses, can, also, elicit, memory, dysfunction, including, sars, cov, 1, mers, cov, ebola, virus, and, even, influenza, virus, interference, can, hamper, memorization, and, retrieval, there, is, retroactive, interference, when, learning, new, information, makes, it, harder, to, recall, old, information, and, proactive, interference, where, prior, learning, disrupts, recall, of, new, information, although, interference, can, lead, to, forgetting, it, is, important, to, keep, in, mind, that, there, are, situations, when, old, information, can, facilitate, learning, of, new, information, knowing, latin, for, instance, can, help, an, individual, learn, a, related, language, such, as, french, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, positive, transfer, stress, has, a, significant, effect, on, memory, formation, and, learning, in, response, to, stressful, situations, the, brain, releases, hormones, and, neurotransmitters, ex, glucocorticoids, and, catecholamines, which, affect, memory, encoding, processes, in, the, hippocampus, behavioural, research, on, animals, shows, that, chronic, stress, produces, adrenal, hormones, which, impact, the, hippocampal, structure, in, the, brains, of, rats, an, experimental, study, by, german, cognitive, psychologists, l, schwabe, and, o, wolf, demonstrates, how, learning, under, stress, also, decreases, memory, recall, in, humans, in, this, study, 48, healthy, female, and, male, university, students, participated, in, either, a, stress, test, or, a, control, group, those, randomly, assigned, to, the, stress, test, group, had, a, hand, immersed, in, ice, cold, water, the, reputable, secpt, or, socially, evaluated, cold, pressor, test, for, up, to, three, minutes, while, being, monitored, and, videotaped, both, the, stress, and, control, groups, were, then, presented, with, 32, words, to, memorize, twenty, four, hours, later, both, groups, were, tested, to, see, how, many, words, they, could, remember, free, recall, as, well, as, how, many, they, could, recognize, from, a, larger, list, of, words, recognition, performance, the, results, showed, a, clear, impairment, of, memory, performance, in, the, stress, test, group, who, recalled, 30, fewer, words, than, the, control, group, the, researchers, suggest, that, stress, experienced, during, learning, distracts, people, by, diverting, their, attention, during, the, memory, encoding, process, however, memory, performance, can, be, enhanced, when, material, is, linked, to, the, learning, context, even, when, learning, occurs, under, stress, a, separate, study, by, cognitive, psychologists, schwabe, and, wolf, shows, that, when, retention, testing, is, done, in, a, context, similar, to, or, congruent, with, the, original, learning, task, i, e, in, the, same, room, memory, impairment, and, the, detrimental, effects, of, stress, on, learning, can, be, attenuated, seventy, two, healthy, female, and, male, university, students, randomly, assigned, to, the, secpt, stress, test, or, to, a, control, group, were, asked, to, remember, the, locations, of, 15, pairs, of, picture, cards, a, computerized, version, of, the, card, game, concentration, or, memory, the, room, in, which, the, experiment, took, place, was, infused, with, the, scent, of, vanilla, as, odour, is, a, strong, cue, for, memory, retention, testing, took, place, the, following, day, either, in, the, same, room, with, the, vanilla, scent, again, present, or, in, a, different, room, without, the, fragrance, the, memory, performance, of, subjects, who, experienced, stress, during, the, object, location, task, decreased, significantly, when, they, were, tested, in, an, unfamiliar, room, without, the, vanilla, scent, an, incongruent, context, however, the, memory, performance, of, stressed, subjects, showed, no, impairment, when, they, were, tested, in, the, original, room, with, the, vanilla, scent, a, congruent, context, all, participants, in, the, experiment, both, stressed, and, unstressed, performed, faster, when, the, learning, and, retrieval, contexts, were, similar, this, research, on, the, effects, of, stress, on, memory, may, have, practical, implications, for, education, for, eyewitness, testimony, and, for, psychotherapy, students, may, perform, better, when, tested, in, their, regular, classroom, rather, than, an, exam, room, eyewitnesses, may, recall, details, better, at, the, scene, of, an, event, than, in, a, courtroom, and, persons, with, post, traumatic, stress, may, improve, when, helped, to, situate, their, memories, of, a, traumatic, event, in, an, appropriate, context, stressful, life, experiences, may, be, a, cause, of, memory, loss, as, a, person, ages, glucocorticoids, that, are, released, during, stress, cause, damage, to, neurons, that, are, located, in, the, hippocampal, region, of, the, brain, therefore, the, more, stressful, situations, that, someone, encounters, the, more, susceptible, they, are, to, memory, loss, later, on, the, ca1, neurons, found, in, the, hippocampus, are, destroyed, due, to, glucocorticoids, decreasing, the, release, of, glucose, and, the, reuptake, of, glutamate, this, high, level, of, extracellular, glutamate, allows, calcium, to, enter, nmda, receptors, which, in, return, kills, neurons, stressful, life, experiences, can, also, cause, repression, of, memories, where, a, person, moves, an, unbearable, memory, to, the, unconscious, mind, this, directly, relates, to, traumatic, events, in, one, s, past, such, as, kidnappings, being, prisoners, of, war, or, sexual, abuse, as, a, child, the, more, long, term, the, exposure, to, stress, is, the, more, impact, it, may, have, however, short, term, exposure, to, stress, also, causes, impairment, in, memory, by, interfering, with, the, function, of, the, hippocampus, research, shows, that, subjects, placed, in, a, stressful, situation, for, a, short, amount, of, time, still, have, blood, glucocorticoid, levels, that, have, increased, drastically, when, measured, after, the, exposure, is, completed, when, subjects, are, asked, to, complete, a, learning, task, after, short, term, exposure, they, often, have, difficulties, prenatal, stress, also, hinders, the, ability, to, learn, and, memorize, by, disrupting, the, development, of, the, hippocampus, and, can, lead, to, unestablished, long, term, potentiation, in, the, offspring, of, severely, stressed, parents, although, the, stress, is, applied, prenatally, the, offspring, show, increased, levels, of, glucocorticoids, when, they, are, subjected, to, stress, later, on, in, life, one, explanation, for, why, children, from, lower, socioeconomic, backgrounds, tend, to, display, poorer, memory, performance, than, their, higher, income, peers, is, the, effects, of, stress, accumulated, over, the, course, of, the, lifetime, the, effects, of, low, income, on, the, developing, hippocampus, is, also, thought, be, mediated, by, chronic, stress, responses, which, may, explain, why, children, from, lower, and, higher, income, backgrounds, differ, in, terms, of, memory, performance, making, memories, occurs, through, a, three, step, process, which, can, be, enhanced, by, sleep, the, three, steps, are, as, follows, sleep, affects, memory, consolidation, during, sleep, the, neural, connections, in, the, brain, are, strengthened, this, enhances, the, brain, s, abilities, to, stabilize, and, retain, memories, there, have, been, several, studies, which, show, that, sleep, improves, the, retention, of, memory, as, memories, are, enhanced, through, active, consolidation, system, consolidation, takes, place, during, slow, wave, sleep, sws, this, process, implicates, that, memories, are, reactivated, during, sleep, but, that, the, process, does, not, enhance, every, memory, it, also, implicates, that, qualitative, changes, are, made, to, the, memories, when, they, are, transferred, to, long, term, store, during, sleep, during, sleep, the, hippocampus, replays, the, events, of, the, day, for, the, neocortex, the, neocortex, then, reviews, and, processes, memories, which, moves, them, into, long, term, memory, when, one, does, not, get, enough, sleep, it, makes, it, more, difficult, to, learn, as, these, neural, connections, are, not, as, strong, resulting, in, a, lower, retention, rate, of, memories, sleep, deprivation, makes, it, harder, to, focus, resulting, in, inefficient, learning, furthermore, some, studies, have, shown, that, sleep, deprivation, can, lead, to, false, memories, as, the, memories, are, not, properly, transferred, to, long, term, memory, one, of, the, primary, functions, of, sleep, is, thought, to, be, the, improvement, of, the, consolidation, of, information, as, several, studies, have, demonstrated, that, memory, depends, on, getting, sufficient, sleep, between, training, and, test, additionally, data, obtained, from, neuroimaging, studies, have, shown, activation, patterns, in, the, sleeping, brain, that, mirror, those, recorded, during, the, learning, of, tasks, from, the, previous, day, suggesting, that, new, memories, may, be, solidified, through, such, rehearsal, although, people, often, think, that, memory, operates, like, recording, equipment, this, is, not, the, case, the, molecular, mechanisms, underlying, the, induction, and, maintenance, of, memory, are, very, dynamic, and, comprise, distinct, phases, covering, a, time, window, from, seconds, to, even, a, lifetime, in, fact, research, has, revealed, that, our, memories, are, constructed, current, hypotheses, suggest, that, constructive, processes, allow, individuals, to, simulate, and, imagine, future, episodes, happenings, and, scenarios, since, the, future, is, not, an, exact, repetition, of, the, past, simulation, of, future, episodes, requires, a, complex, system, that, can, draw, on, the, past, in, a, manner, that, flexibly, extracts, and, recombines, elements, of, previous, experiences, a, constructive, rather, than, a, reproductive, system, people, can, construct, their, memories, when, they, encode, them, and, or, when, they, recall, them, to, illustrate, consider, a, classic, study, conducted, by, elizabeth, loftus, and, john, palmer, 1974, in, which, people, were, instructed, to, watch, a, film, of, a, traffic, accident, and, then, asked, about, what, they, saw, the, researchers, found, that, the, people, who, were, asked, how, fast, were, the, cars, going, when, they, smashed, into, each, other, gave, higher, estimates, than, those, who, were, asked, how, fast, were, the, cars, going, when, they, hit, each, other, furthermore, when, asked, a, week, later, whether, they, had, seen, broken, glass, in, the, film, those, who, had, been, asked, the, question, with, smashed, were, twice, more, likely, to, report, that, they, had, seen, broken, glass, than, those, who, had, been, asked, the, question, with, hit, there, was, no, broken, glass, depicted, in, the, film, thus, the, wording, of, the, questions, distorted, viewers, memories, of, the, event, importantly, the, wording, of, the, question, led, people, to, construct, different, memories, of, the, event, those, who, were, asked, the, question, with, smashed, recalled, a, more, serious, car, accident, than, they, had, actually, seen, the, findings, of, this, experiment, were, replicated, around, the, world, and, researchers, consistently, demonstrated, that, when, people, were, provided, with, misleading, information, they, tended, to, misremember, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, misinformation, effect, research, has, revealed, that, asking, individuals, to, repeatedly, imagine, actions, that, they, have, never, performed, or, events, that, they, have, never, experienced, could, result, in, false, memories, for, instance, goff, and, roediger, 1998, asked, participants, to, imagine, that, they, performed, an, act, e, g, break, a, toothpick, and, then, later, asked, them, whether, they, had, done, such, a, thing, findings, revealed, that, those, participants, who, repeatedly, imagined, performing, such, an, act, were, more, likely, to, think, that, they, had, actually, performed, that, act, during, the, first, session, of, the, experiment, similarly, garry, and, her, colleagues, 1996, asked, college, students, to, report, how, certain, they, were, that, they, experienced, a, number, of, events, as, children, e, g, broke, a, window, with, their, hand, and, then, two, weeks, later, asked, them, to, imagine, four, of, those, events, the, researchers, found, that, one, fourth, of, the, students, asked, to, imagine, the, four, events, reported, that, they, had, actually, experienced, such, events, as, children, that, is, when, asked, to, imagine, the, events, they, were, more, confident, that, they, experienced, the, events, research, reported, in, 2013, revealed, that, it, is, possible, to, artificially, stimulate, prior, memories, and, artificially, implant, false, memories, in, mice, using, optogenetics, a, team, of, riken, mit, scientists, caused, the, mice, to, incorrectly, associate, a, benign, environment, with, a, prior, unpleasant, experience, from, different, surroundings, some, scientists, believe, that, the, study, may, have, implications, in, studying, false, memory, formation, in, humans, and, in, treating, ptsd, and, schizophrenia, memory, reconsolidation, is, when, previously, consolidated, memories, are, recalled, or, retrieved, from, long, term, memory, to, your, active, consciousness, during, this, process, memories, can, be, further, strengthened, and, added, to, but, there, is, also, risk, of, manipulation, involved, we, like, to, think, of, our, memories, as, something, stable, and, constant, when, they, are, stored, in, long, term, memory, but, this, is, not, the, case, there, are, a, large, number, of, studies, that, found, that, consolidation, of, memories, is, not, a, singular, event, but, are, put, through, the, process, again, known, as, reconsolidation, this, is, when, a, memory, is, recalled, or, retrieved, and, placed, back, into, your, working, memory, the, memory, is, now, open, to, manipulation, from, outside, sources, and, the, misinformation, effect, which, could, be, due, to, misattributing, the, source, of, the, inconsistent, information, with, or, without, an, intact, original, memory, trace, lindsay, and, johnson, 1989, one, thing, that, can, be, sure, is, that, memory, is, malleable, this, new, research, into, the, concept, of, reconsolidation, has, opened, the, door, to, methods, to, help, those, with, unpleasant, memories, or, those, that, struggle, with, memories, an, example, of, this, is, if, you, had, a, truly, frightening, experience, and, recall, that, memory, in, a, less, arousing, environment, the, memory, will, be, weaken, the, next, time, it, is, retrieved, some, studies, suggest, that, over, trained, or, strongly, reinforced, memories, do, not, undergo, reconsolidation, if, reactivated, the, first, few, days, after, training, but, do, become, sensitive, to, reconsolidation, interference, with, time, this, however, does, not, mean, that, all, memory, is, susceptible, to, reconsolidation, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, memory, that, has, undergone, strong, training, and, whether, or, not, is, it, intentional, is, less, likely, to, undergo, reconsolidation, there, was, further, testing, done, with, rats, and, mazes, that, showed, that, reactivated, memories, were, more, susceptible, to, manipulation, in, both, good, and, bad, ways, than, newly, formed, memories, it, is, still, not, known, whether, or, not, these, are, new, memories, formed, and, it, is, an, inability, to, retrieve, the, proper, one, for, the, situation, or, if, it, is, a, reconsolidated, memory, because, the, study, of, reconsolidation, is, still, a, newer, concept, there, is, still, debate, on, whether, it, should, be, considered, scientifically, sound, a, ucla, research, study, published, in, the, june, 2008, issue, of, the, american, journal, of, geriatric, psychiatry, found, that, people, can, improve, cognitive, function, and, brain, efficiency, through, simple, lifestyle, changes, such, as, incorporating, memory, exercises, healthy, eating, physical, fitness, and, stress, reduction, into, their, daily, lives, this, study, examined, 17, subjects, average, age, 53, with, normal, memory, performance, eight, subjects, were, asked, to, follow, a, brain, healthy, diet, relaxation, physical, and, mental, exercise, brain, teasers, and, verbal, memory, training, techniques, after, 14, days, they, showed, greater, word, fluency, not, memory, compared, to, their, baseline, performance, no, long, term, follow, up, was, conducted, it, is, therefore, unclear, if, this, intervention, has, lasting, effects, on, memory, there, are, a, loosely, associated, group, of, mnemonic, principles, and, techniques, that, can, be, used, to, vastly, improve, memory, known, as, the, art, of, memory, the, international, longevity, center, released, in, 2001, a, report, which, includes, in, pages, 14, 16, recommendations, for, keeping, the, mind, in, good, functionality, until, advanced, age, some, of, the, recommendations, are, memorization, is, a, method, of, learning, that, allows, an, individual, to, recall, information, verbatim, rote, learning, is, the, method, most, often, used, methods, of, memorizing, things, have, been, the, subject, of, much, discussion, over, the, years, with, some, writers, such, as, cosmos, rossellius, using, visual, alphabets, the, spacing, effect, shows, that, an, individual, is, more, likely, to, remember, a, list, of, items, when, rehearsal, is, spaced, over, an, extended, period, of, time, in, contrast, to, this, is, cramming, an, intensive, memorization, in, a, short, period, of, time, the, spacing, effect, is, exploited, to, improve, memory, in, spaced, repetition, flashcard, training, also, relevant, is, the, zeigarnik, effect, which, states, that, people, remember, uncompleted, or, interrupted, tasks, better, than, completed, ones, the, so, called, method, of, loci, uses, spatial, memory, to, memorize, non, spatial, information, plants, lack, a, specialized, organ, devoted, to, memory, retention, so, plant, memory, has, been, a, controversial, topic, in, recent, years, new, advances, in, the, field, have, identified, the, presence, of, neurotransmitters, in, plants, adding, to, the, hypothesis, that, plants, are, capable, of, remembering, action, potentials, a, physiological, response, characteristic, of, neurons, have, been, shown, to, have, an, influence, on, plants, as, well, including, in, wound, responses, and, photosynthesis, in, addition, to, these, homologous, features, of, memory, systems, in, both, plants, and, animals, plants, have, also, been, observed, to, encode, store, and, retrieve, basic, short, term, memories, one, of, the, most, well, studied, plants, to, show, rudimentary, memory, is, the, venus, flytrap, native, to, the, subtropical, wetlands, of, the, eastern, united, states, venus, flytraps, have, evolved, the, ability, to, obtain, meat, for, sustenance, likely, due, to, the, lack, of, nitrogen, in, the, soil, this, is, done, by, two, trap, forming, leaf, tips, that, snap, shut, once, triggered, by, a, potential, prey, on, each, lobe, three, trigger, hairs, await, stimulation, in, order, to, maximize, the, benefit, to, cost, ratio, the, plant, enables, a, rudimentary, form, of, memory, in, which, two, trigger, hairs, must, be, stimulated, within, thirty, seconds, in, order, to, result, in, trap, closure, this, system, ensures, that, the, trap, only, closes, when, potential, prey, is, within, grasp, the, time, lapse, between, trigger, hair, stimulations, suggests, that, the, plant, can, remember, an, initial, stimulus, long, enough, for, a, second, stimulus, to, initiate, trap, closure, this, memory, is, not, encoded, in, a, brain, as, plants, lack, this, specialized, organ, rather, information, is, stored, in, the, form, of, cytoplasmic, calcium, levels, the, first, trigger, causes, a, subthreshold, cytoplasmic, calcium, influx, this, initial, trigger, is, not, enough, to, activate, trap, closure, so, a, subsequent, stimulus, allows, for, a, secondary, influx, of, calcium, the, latter, calcium, rise, superimposes, on, the, initial, one, creating, an, action, potential, that, passes, threshold, resulting, in, trap, closure, researchers, to, prove, that, an, electrical, threshold, must, be, met, to, stimulate, trap, closure, excited, a, single, trigger, hair, with, a, constant, mechanical, stimulus, using, ag, agcl, electrodes, the, trap, closed, after, only, a, few, seconds, this, experiment, demonstrated, that, the, electrical, threshold, not, necessarily, the, number, of, trigger, hair, stimulations, was, the, contributing, factor, in, venus, flytrap, memory, it, has, been, shown, that, trap, closure, can, be, blocked, using, uncouplers, and, inhibitors, of, voltage, gated, channels, after, trap, closure, these, electrical, signals, stimulate, glandular, production, of, jasmonic, acid, and, hydrolases, allowing, for, digestion, of, prey, many, other, plants, exhibit, the, capacity, to, remember, including, mimosa, pudica, an, experimental, apparatus, was, designed, to, drop, potted, mimosa, plants, repeatedly, from, the, same, distance, and, at, the, same, speed, it, was, observed, that, the, plants, defensive, response, of, curling, up, their, leaves, decreased, over, the, sixty, times, the, experiment, was, repeated, to, confirm, that, this, was, a, mechanism, of, memory, rather, than, exhaustion, some, of, the, plants, were, shaken, post, experiment, and, displayed, normal, defensive, responses, of, leaf, curling, this, experiment, demonstrated, long, term, memory, in, the, plants, as, it, was, repeated, a, month, later, and, the, plants, were, observed, to, remain, unfazed, by, the, dropping
