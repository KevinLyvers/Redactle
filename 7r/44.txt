the, concept, of, taxing, income, is, a, modern, innovation, and, presupposes, several, things, a, money, economy, reasonably, accurate, accounts, a, common, understanding, of, receipts, expenses, and, profits, and, an, orderly, society, with, reliable, records, for, most, of, the, history, of, civilization, these, preconditions, did, not, exist, and, taxes, were, based, on, other, factors, taxes, on, wealth, social, position, and, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, typically, land, and, slaves, were, all, common, practices, such, as, tithing, or, an, offering, of, first, fruits, existed, from, ancient, times, and, can, be, regarded, as, a, precursor, of, the, income, tax, but, they, lacked, precision, and, certainly, were, not, based, on, a, concept, of, net, increase, the, first, income, tax, is, generally, attributed, to, egypt, in, the, early, days, of, the, roman, republic, public, taxes, consisted, of, modest, assessments, on, owned, wealth, and, property, the, tax, rate, under, normal, circumstances, was, 1, and, sometimes, would, climb, as, high, as, 3, in, situations, such, as, war, these, modest, taxes, were, levied, against, land, homes, and, other, real, estate, slaves, animals, personal, items, and, monetary, wealth, the, more, a, person, had, in, property, the, more, tax, they, paid, taxes, were, collected, from, individuals, in, the, year, 10, ad, emperor, wang, mang, of, the, xin, dynasty, instituted, an, unprecedented, income, tax, at, the, rate, of, 10, percent, of, profits, for, professionals, and, skilled, labor, he, was, overthrown, 13, years, later, in, 23, ad, and, earlier, policies, were, restored, during, the, reestablished, han, dynasty, which, followed, one, of, the, first, recorded, taxes, on, income, was, the, saladin, tithe, introduced, by, henry, ii, in, 1188, to, raise, money, for, the, third, crusade, the, tithe, demanded, that, each, layperson, in, england, and, wales, be, taxed, one, tenth, of, their, personal, income, and, moveable, property, in, 1641, portugal, introduced, a, personal, income, tax, called, the, d, cima, the, inception, date, of, the, modern, income, tax, is, typically, accepted, as, 1799, at, the, suggestion, of, henry, beeke, the, future, dean, of, bristol, this, income, tax, was, introduced, into, great, britain, by, prime, minister, william, pitt, the, younger, in, his, budget, of, december, 1798, to, pay, for, weapons, and, equipment, for, the, french, revolutionary, war, pitt, s, new, graduated, progressive, income, tax, began, at, a, levy, of, 2, old, pence, in, the, pound, 1, 120, on, incomes, over, 60, equivalent, to, 6, 700, in, 2023, and, increased, up, to, a, maximum, of, 2, shillings, in, the, pound, 10, on, incomes, of, over, 200, pitt, hoped, that, the, new, income, tax, would, raise, 10, million, a, year, but, actual, receipts, for, 1799, totalled, only, a, little, over, 6, million, pitt, s, income, tax, was, levied, from, 1799, to, 1802, when, it, was, abolished, by, henry, addington, during, the, peace, of, amiens, addington, had, taken, over, as, prime, minister, in, 1801, after, pitt, s, resignation, over, catholic, emancipation, the, income, tax, was, reintroduced, by, addington, in, 1803, when, hostilities, with, france, recommenced, but, it, was, again, abolished, in, 1816, one, year, after, the, battle, of, waterloo, opponents, of, the, tax, who, thought, it, should, only, be, used, to, finance, wars, wanted, all, records, of, the, tax, destroyed, along, with, its, repeal, records, were, publicly, burned, by, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, but, copies, were, retained, in, the, basement, of, the, tax, court, in, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, income, tax, was, reintroduced, by, sir, robert, peel, by, the, income, tax, act, 1842, peel, as, a, conservative, had, opposed, income, tax, in, the, 1841, general, election, but, a, growing, budget, deficit, required, a, new, source, of, funds, the, new, income, tax, based, on, addington, s, model, was, imposed, on, incomes, above, 150, equivalent, to, 19, 487, in, 2023, although, this, measure, was, initially, intended, to, be, temporary, it, soon, became, a, fixture, of, the, british, taxation, system, a, committee, was, formed, in, 1851, under, joseph, hume, to, investigate, the, matter, but, failed, to, reach, a, clear, recommendation, despite, the, vociferous, objection, william, gladstone, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, from, 1852, kept, the, progressive, income, tax, and, extended, it, to, cover, the, costs, of, the, crimean, war, by, the, 1860s, the, progressive, tax, had, become, a, grudgingly, accepted, element, of, the, united, kingdom, fiscal, system, the, us, federal, government, imposed, the, first, personal, income, tax, on, august, 5, 1861, to, help, pay, for, its, war, effort, in, the, american, civil, war, 3, of, all, incomes, over, us, 800, equivalent, to, 21, 300, in, 2023, this, tax, was, repealed, and, replaced, by, another, income, tax, in, 1862, it, was, only, in, 1894, that, the, first, peacetime, income, tax, was, passed, through, the, wilson, gorman, tariff, the, rate, was, 2, on, income, over, 4000, equivalent, to, 126, 000, in, 2023, which, meant, fewer, than, 10, of, households, would, pay, any, the, purpose, of, the, income, tax, was, to, make, up, for, revenue, that, would, be, lost, by, tariff, reductions, the, us, supreme, court, ruled, the, income, tax, unconstitutional, the, 10th, amendment, forbidding, any, powers, not, expressed, in, the, us, constitution, and, there, being, no, power, to, impose, any, other, than, a, direct, tax, by, apportionment, in, 1913, the, sixteenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, cleared, the, unconstitutionality, obstacle, which, previously, had, not, allowed, for, the, implementation, of, a, federal, income, tax, before, 1913, in, the, united, states, in, fiscal, year, 1918, annual, internal, revenue, collections, for, the, first, time, passed, the, billion, dollar, mark, rising, to, 5, 4, billion, by, 1920, the, amount, of, income, collected, via, income, tax, has, varied, dramatically, from, 1, for, the, lowest, bracket, in, the, early, days, of, us, income, tax, to, taxation, rates, of, over, 90, for, the, highest, bracket, during, world, war, ii, while, tax, rules, vary, widely, certain, basic, principles, are, common, to, most, income, tax, systems, tax, systems, in, canada, china, germany, singapore, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, among, others, follow, most, of, the, principles, outlined, below, some, tax, systems, such, as, india, may, have, significant, differences, from, the, principles, outlined, below, most, references, below, are, examples, see, specific, articles, by, jurisdiction, e, g, income, tax, in, australia, individuals, are, often, taxed, at, different, rates, than, corporations, individuals, include, only, human, beings, tax, systems, in, countries, other, than, the, us, treat, an, entity, as, a, corporation, only, if, it, is, legally, organized, as, a, corporation, estates, and, trusts, are, usually, subject, to, special, tax, provisions, other, taxable, entities, are, generally, treated, as, partnerships, in, the, us, many, kinds, of, entities, may, elect, to, be, treated, as, a, corporation, or, a, partnership, partners, of, partnerships, are, treated, as, having, income, deductions, and, credits, equal, to, their, shares, of, such, partnership, items, separate, taxes, are, assessed, against, each, taxpayer, meeting, certain, minimum, criteria, many, systems, allow, married, individuals, to, request, joint, assessment, many, systems, allow, controlled, groups, of, locally, organized, corporations, to, be, jointly, assessed, tax, rates, vary, widely, some, systems, impose, higher, rates, on, higher, amounts, of, income, tax, rates, schedules, may, vary, for, individuals, based, on, marital, status, in, india, on, the, other, hand, there, is, a, slab, rate, system, where, for, income, below, inr, 2, 5, lakhs, per, annum, the, tax, is, zero, percent, for, those, with, their, income, in, the, slab, rate, of, inr, 2, 50, 001, to, inr, 5, 00, 000, the, tax, rate, is, 5, in, this, way, the, rate, goes, up, with, each, slab, reaching, to, 30, tax, rate, for, those, with, income, above, inr, 15, 00, 000, residents, are, generally, taxed, differently, from, non, residents, few, jurisdictions, tax, non, residents, other, than, on, specific, types, of, income, earned, within, the, jurisdiction, see, e, g, the, discussion, of, taxation, by, the, united, states, of, foreign, persons, residents, however, are, generally, subject, to, income, tax, on, all, worldwide, income, a, handful, of, jurisdictions, notably, singapore, and, hong, kong, tax, residents, only, on, income, earned, in, or, remitted, to, the, jurisdiction, there, may, arise, a, situation, where, the, tax, payer, has, to, pay, tax, in, one, jurisdiction, he, or, she, is, tax, resident, and, also, pay, tax, to, other, country, where, he, or, she, is, non, resident, this, creates, the, situation, of, double, taxation, which, needs, assessment, of, double, taxation, avoidance, agreement, entered, by, the, jurisdictions, where, the, tax, payer, is, assessed, as, resident, and, non, resident, for, the, same, transaction, residence, is, often, defined, for, individuals, as, presence, in, the, jurisdiction, for, more, than, 183, days, most, jurisdictions, base, residence, of, entities, on, either, place, of, organization, or, place, of, management, and, control, most, systems, define, income, subject, to, tax, broadly, for, residents, but, tax, nonresidents, only, on, specific, types, of, income, what, is, included, in, income, for, individuals, may, differ, from, what, is, included, for, entities, the, timing, of, recognizing, income, may, differ, by, type, of, taxpayer, or, type, of, income, income, generally, includes, most, types, of, receipts, that, enrich, the, taxpayer, including, compensation, for, services, gain, from, sale, of, goods, or, other, property, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, annuities, pensions, and, all, manner, of, other, items, many, systems, exclude, from, income, part, or, all, of, superannuation, or, other, national, retirement, plan, payments, most, tax, systems, exclude, from, income, health, care, benefits, provided, by, employers, or, under, national, insurance, systems, nearly, all, income, tax, systems, permit, residents, to, reduce, gross, income, by, business, and, some, other, types, of, deductions, by, contrast, nonresidents, are, generally, subject, to, income, tax, on, the, gross, amount, of, income, of, most, types, plus, the, net, business, income, earned, within, the, jurisdiction, expenses, incurred, in, a, trading, business, rental, or, other, income, producing, activity, are, generally, deductible, though, there, may, be, limitations, on, some, types, of, expenses, or, activities, business, expenses, include, all, manner, of, costs, for, the, benefit, of, the, activity, an, allowance, as, a, capital, allowance, or, depreciation, deduction, is, nearly, always, allowed, for, recovery, of, costs, of, assets, used, in, the, activity, rules, on, capital, allowances, vary, widely, and, often, permit, recovery, of, costs, more, quickly, than, ratably, over, the, life, of, the, asset, most, systems, allow, individuals, some, sort, of, notional, deductions, or, an, amount, subject, to, zero, tax, in, addition, many, systems, allow, deduction, of, some, types, of, personal, expenses, such, as, home, mortgage, interest, or, medical, expenses, only, net, income, from, business, activities, whether, conducted, by, individuals, or, entities, is, taxable, with, few, exceptions, many, countries, require, business, enterprises, to, prepare, financial, statements, which, must, be, audited, tax, systems, in, those, countries, often, define, taxable, income, as, income, per, those, financial, statements, with, few, if, any, adjustments, a, few, jurisdictions, compute, net, income, as, a, fixed, percentage, of, gross, revenues, for, some, types, of, businesses, particularly, branches, of, nonresidents, nearly, all, systems, permit, residents, a, credit, for, income, taxes, paid, to, other, jurisdictions, of, the, same, sort, thus, a, credit, is, allowed, at, the, national, level, for, income, taxes, paid, to, other, countries, many, income, tax, systems, permit, other, credits, of, various, sorts, and, such, credits, are, often, unique, to, the, jurisdiction, some, jurisdictions, particularly, the, united, states, and, many, of, its, states, and, switzerland, impose, the, higher, of, regular, income, tax, or, an, alternative, tax, switzerland, and, u, s, states, generally, impose, such, tax, only, on, corporations, and, base, it, on, capital, or, a, similar, measure, income, tax, is, generally, collected, in, one, of, two, ways, through, withholding, of, tax, at, source, and, or, through, payments, directly, by, taxpayers, nearly, all, jurisdictions, require, those, paying, employees, or, nonresidents, to, withhold, income, tax, from, such, payments, the, amount, to, be, withheld, is, a, fixed, percentage, where, the, tax, itself, is, at, a, fixed, rate, alternatively, the, amount, to, be, withheld, may, be, determined, by, the, tax, administration, of, the, country, or, by, the, payer, using, formulas, provided, by, the, tax, administration, payees, are, generally, required, to, provide, to, the, payer, or, the, government, the, information, needed, to, make, the, determinations, withholding, for, employees, is, often, referred, to, as, pay, as, you, earn, paye, or, pay, as, you, go, income, taxes, of, workers, are, often, collected, by, employers, under, a, withholding, or, pay, as, you, earn, tax, system, such, collections, are, not, necessarily, final, amounts, of, tax, as, the, worker, may, be, required, to, aggregate, wage, income, with, other, income, and, or, deductions, to, determine, actual, tax, calculation, of, the, tax, to, be, withheld, may, be, done, by, the, government, or, by, employers, based, on, withholding, allowances, or, formulas, nearly, all, systems, require, those, whose, proper, tax, is, not, fully, settled, through, withholding, to, self, assess, tax, and, make, payments, prior, to, or, with, final, determination, of, the, tax, self, assessment, means, the, taxpayer, must, make, a, computation, of, tax, and, submit, it, to, the, government, some, countries, provide, a, pre, computed, estimate, to, taxpayers, which, the, taxpayer, can, correct, as, necessary, the, proportion, of, people, who, pay, their, income, taxes, in, full, on, time, and, voluntarily, that, is, without, being, fined, or, ordered, to, pay, more, by, the, government, is, called, the, voluntary, compliance, rate, the, voluntary, compliance, rate, is, higher, in, the, us, than, in, countries, like, germany, or, italy, in, countries, with, a, sizeable, black, market, the, voluntary, compliance, rate, is, very, low, and, may, be, impossible, to, properly, calculate, income, taxes, are, separately, imposed, by, sub, national, jurisdictions, in, several, countries, with, federal, systems, these, include, canada, germany, switzerland, and, the, united, states, where, provinces, cantons, or, states, impose, separate, taxes, in, a, few, countries, cities, also, impose, income, taxes, the, system, may, be, integrated, as, in, germany, with, taxes, collected, at, the, federal, level, in, quebec, and, the, united, states, federal, and, state, systems, are, independently, administered, and, have, differences, in, determination, of, taxable, income, retirement, oriented, taxes, such, as, social, security, or, national, insurance, also, are, a, type, of, income, tax, though, not, generally, referred, to, as, such, in, the, us, these, taxes, generally, are, imposed, at, a, fixed, rate, on, wages, or, self, employment, earnings, up, to, a, maximum, amount, per, year, the, tax, may, be, imposed, on, the, employer, the, employee, or, both, at, the, same, or, different, rates, some, jurisdictions, also, impose, a, tax, collected, from, employers, to, fund, unemployment, insurance, health, care, or, similar, government, outlays, multiple, conflicting, theories, have, been, proposed, regarding, the, economic, impact, of, income, taxes, income, taxes, are, widely, viewed, as, a, progressive, tax, the, incidence, of, tax, increases, as, income, increases, some, studies, have, suggested, that, an, income, tax, does, not, have, much, effect, on, the, numbers, of, hours, worked, tax, avoidance, strategies, and, loopholes, tend, to, emerge, within, income, tax, codes, they, get, created, when, taxpayers, find, legal, methods, to, avoid, paying, taxes, lawmakers, then, attempt, to, close, the, loopholes, with, additional, legislation, that, leads, to, a, vicious, cycle, of, ever, more, complex, avoidance, strategies, and, legislation, the, vicious, cycle, tends, to, benefit, large, corporations, and, wealthy, individuals, that, can, afford, the, professional, fees, that, come, with, ever, more, sophisticated, tax, planning, thus, challenging, the, notion, that, even, a, marginal, income, tax, system, can, be, properly, called, progressive, the, higher, costs, to, labour, and, capital, imposed, by, income, tax, causes, dead, weight, loss, in, an, economy, being, the, loss, of, economic, activity, from, people, deciding, not, to, invest, capital, or, use, time, productively, because, of, the, burden, that, tax, would, impose, on, those, activities, there, is, also, a, loss, from, individuals, and, professional, advisors, devoting, time, to, tax, avoiding, behaviour, instead, of, economically, productive, activities, bracket, creep, is, usually, defined, as, the, process, by, which, inflation, pushes, wages, and, salaries, into, higher, tax, brackets, leading, to, fiscal, drag, however, even, if, there, is, only, one, tax, bracket, or, one, remains, within, the, same, tax, bracket, there, will, still, be, bracket, creep, resulting, in, a, higher, proportion, of, income, being, paid, in, tax, that, is, although, the, marginal, tax, rate, remains, unchanged, with, inflation, the, average, tax, rate, will, increase, most, progressive, tax, systems, are, not, adjusted, for, inflation, as, wages, and, salaries, rise, in, nominal, terms, under, the, influence, of, inflation, they, become, more, highly, taxed, even, though, in, real, terms, the, value, of, the, wages, and, salaries, has, not, increased, at, all, the, net, effect, is, that, in, real, terms, taxes, rise, unless, the, tax, rates, or, brackets, are, adjusted, to, compensate, many, types, of, income, are, subject, to, income, tax, which, is, very, variable, it, all, depends, on, the, country, and, its, tax, laws, in, general, countries, impose, taxes, on, income, from, wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and, rental, income, the, most, typical, ones, are, wage, and, salary, which, are, almost, always, subject, to, taxation, withheld, by, employers, some, one, time, payments, such, as, bonuses, paid, to, employees, are, taxable, dividends, and, interest, stocks, or, bonds, are, usually, also, taxed, there, is, a, very, wide, variation, in, the, amount, of, taxation, in, different, countries, for, example, countries, such, as, singapore, belgium, and, united, arab, emirates, levy, low, income, tax, on, interest, and, dividends, while, countries, such, as, denmark, france, and, united, states, have, very, high, income, tax, for, this, type, of, income, for, profits, that, are, earned, by, selling, assets, or, a, real, estate, capital, gains, the, income, tax, varies, between, countries, and, is, different, from, for, any, other, types, of, income, rental, income, may, also, sometimes, be, subject, to, income, tax, but, many, countries, offer, deductions, or, even, exemptions, for, this, type, of, income, income, taxes, are, used, in, most, countries, around, the, world, the, tax, systems, vary, greatly, and, can, consist, of, a, flat, fixed, rate, progressive, or, regressive, structures, depending, on, the, type, of, tax, comparison, of, tax, rates, around, the, world, is, a, difficult, and, somewhat, subjective, enterprise, tax, laws, in, most, countries, are, extremely, complex, and, tax, burden, falls, differently, on, different, groups, in, each, country, and, sub, national, unit, of, course, services, provided, by, governments, in, return, for, taxation, also, vary, making, comparisons, all, the, more, difficult, countries, that, tax, income, generally, use, one, of, two, systems, territorial, or, residential, in, the, territorial, system, only, local, income, income, from, a, source, inside, the, country, is, taxed, in, the, residential, system, residents, of, the, country, are, taxed, on, their, worldwide, local, and, foreign, income, while, non, residents, are, taxed, only, on, their, local, income, in, addition, a, very, small, number, of, countries, notably, the, united, states, also, tax, their, non, resident, citizens, on, worldwide, income, countries, with, a, residential, system, of, taxation, usually, allow, deductions, or, credits, for, the, tax, that, residents, already, pay, to, other, countries, on, their, foreign, income, many, countries, also, sign, tax, treaties, with, each, other, to, eliminate, or, reduce, double, taxation, countries, do, not, necessarily, use, the, same, system, of, taxation, for, individuals, and, corporations, for, example, france, uses, a, residential, system, for, individuals, but, a, territorial, system, for, corporations, while, singapore, does, the, opposite, and, brunei, taxes, corporate, but, not, personal, income, public, disclosure, of, personal, income, tax, filings, occurs, in, finland, norway, and, sweden, as, of, the, late, 2000s, and, early, 2010s, in, sweden, this, information, has, been, published, in, the, annual, directory, taxeringskalendern, since, 1905, comprehensive, employment, and, training, act
