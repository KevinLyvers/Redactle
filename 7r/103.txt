the, precious, metal, most, coins, are, made, of, a, base, metal, and, their, value, comes, from, their, status, as, fiat, money, the, value, of, the, coin, is, established, by, law, in, the, last, hundred, years, the, face, value, of, circulated, coins, has, occasionally, been, lower, than, the, value, of, the, metal, they, contain, primarily, due, to, inflation, if, the, difference, becomes, significant, the, issuing, authority, may, decide, to, withdraw, these, coins, from, circulation, possibly, issuing, new, equivalents, with, a, different, composition, or, the, public, may, decide,

investor, coins, include, the, british, sovereign, minted, by, the, united, kingdom, the, american, gold, eagle, minted, by, the, united, states, the, canadian, gold, maple, leaf, minted, by, canada, and, the, krugerrand, minted, by, south, africa, while, the, eagle, and, sovereign, coins, have, nominal, purely, symbolic, face, values, the, krugerrand, does, not, commemorative, coins, usually, serve, as, collectors, items, only, although, some, countries, also, issue, commemorative, coins, for, regular, circulation, historically, a, considerable, variety, of, coinage, metals, including, alloys, and, other, materials, e, g, porcelain, have, been, used, to, produce, coins, for, circulation, collection, and, metal, investment, bullion, coins, often, serve, as, more, convenient, stores, of, assured, metal, quantity, and, purity, than, other, bullion, early, metal, coinage, came, into, use, about, the, time, of, the, axial, age, in, the, greek, world, in, northern, india, and, in, china, metal, ingots, silver, bullion, or, unmarked, bars, were, probably, in, use, for, exchange, among, many, of, the, civilizations, that, mastered, metallurgy, the, weight, and, purity, of, bullion, would, be, the, key, determinant, of, value, in, the, achaemenid, empire, in, the, early, 6th, century, bc, coinage, was, yet, unknown, the, barter, system, as, well, as, silver, bullion, were, used, instead, for, trade, the, practice, of, using, silver, bars, for, currency, also, seems, to, have, been, current, in, central, asia, from, the, 6th, century, bc, coins, were, an, evolution, of, currency, systems, of, the, late, bronze, age, when, various, cultures, used, standard, sized, ingots, and, tokens, such, as, knife, money, to, store, and, transfer, value, phoenician, metal, ingots, had, to, be, stamped, with, the, name, of, a, current, ruler, to, guarantee, their, worth, and, value, which, is, probably, how, stamping, busts, and, designs, began, although, political, advertising, glorification, of, a, state, or, of, a, ruler, may, also, play, a, role, in, the, late, chinese, bronze, age, standardized, cast, tokens, were, made, such, as, those, discovered, in, a, tomb, near, anyang, these, were, replicas, in, bronze, of, earlier, chinese, currency, cowrie, shells, so, they, were, named, bronze, shell, the, world, s, oldest, known, coin, factory, has, been, excavated, in, the, ancient, city, guanzhuang, in, henan, province, in, china, the, factory, produced, shovel, shaped, bronze, coins, between, 640, b, c, and, 550, b, c, making, it, the, oldest, securely, dated, minting, site, the, earliest, coins, are, mostly, associated, with, iron, age, anatolia, of, the, late, 7th, century, bc, and, especially, with, the, kingdom, of, lydia, early, electrum, coins, an, alluvial, alloy, of, gold, and, silver, varying, wildly, in, proportion, and, usually, about, 40, 55, gold, were, not, standardized, in, weight, and, in, their, earliest, stage, may, have, been, ritual, objects, such, as, badges, or, medals, issued, by, priests, the, unpredictability, of, the, composition, of, naturally, occurring, electrum, implied, that, it, had, a, variable, value, which, greatly, hampered, its, development, most, of, the, early, lydian, coins, include, no, writing, myth, or, inscription, only, an, image, of, a, symbolic, animal, therefore, the, dating, of, these, coins, relies, primarily, on, archaeological, evidence, with, the, most, commonly, cited, evidence, coming, from, excavations, at, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesus, also, called, the, ephesian, artemision, which, would, later, evolve, into, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, this, was, the, site, of, the, earliest, known, deposit, of, electrum, coins, anatolian, artemis, was, the, potnia, th, r, n, mistress, of, animals, whose, symbol, was, the, stag, it, took, some, time, before, ancient, coins, were, used, for, commerce, and, trade, even, the, smallest, denomination, electrum, coins, perhaps, worth, about, a, day, s, subsistence, would, have, been, too, valuable, for, buying, a, loaf, of, bread, maybe, the, first, coins, to, be, used, for, retailing, on, a, large, scale, basis, were, likely, small, silver, fractions, hemiobol, ancient, greek, coinage, minted, by, the, ionian, greeks, in, the, late, sixth, century, bc, in, contrast, herodotus, mentioned, the, innovation, made, by, the, lydians, so, far, as, we, have, any, knowledge, they, were, the, first, people, to, introduce, the, use, of, gold, and, silver, coins, and, the, first, who, sold, goods, by, retail, and, both, aristotle, fr, 611, 37, ed, v, rose, and, pollux, onamastikon, ix, 83, mention, that, the, first, issuer, of, coinage, was, hermodike, demodike, of, cyme, cyme, was, a, city, in, aeolia, nearby, lydia, another, example, of, local, pride, is, the, dispute, about, coinage, whether, the, first, one, to, strike, it, was, pheidon, of, argos, or, demodike, of, kyme, who, was, wife, of, midas, the, phrygian, and, daughter, of, king, agammemnon, of, kyme, or, erichthonios, and, lycos, of, athens, or, the, lydians, as, xenophanes, says, or, the, naxians, as, anglosthenes, thought, many, early, lydian, and, greek, coins, were, minted, under, the, authority, of, private, individuals, and, are, thus, more, akin, to, tokens, or, badges, than, to, modern, coins, though, due, to, their, numbers, it, is, evident, that, some, were, official, state, issues, the, earliest, inscribed, coins, are, those, of, phanes, dated, to, 625, 600, bc, from, ephesus, in, ionia, with, the, legend, h, or, similar, i, am, the, badge, sign, mark, of, phanes, light, or, just, bearing, the, name, of, phanes, the, first, electrum, coins, issued, by, a, monarch, are, those, minted, by, king, alyattes, of, lydia, died, c, 560, bc, for, which, reason, this, king, is, sometimes, mentioned, as, the, originator, of, coinage, the, successor, of, alyattes, king, croesus, r, c, 560, 546, bc, became, associated, with, great, wealth, in, greek, historiography, he, is, credited, with, issuing, the, croeseid, the, first, true, gold, coins, with, a, standardized, purity, for, general, circulation, and, the, world, s, first, bimetallic, monetary, system, c, 550, bc, coins, spread, rapidly, in, the, 6th, and, 5th, centuries, bc, leading, to, the, development, of, ancient, greek, coinage, and, achaemenid, coinage, and, further, to, illyrian, coinage, when, cyrus, the, great, 550, 530, bc, came, to, power, coinage, was, unfamiliar, in, his, realm, barter, and, to, some, extent, silver, bullion, was, used, instead, for, trade, the, practice, of, using, silver, bars, for, currency, also, seems, to, have, been, current, in, central, asia, from, the, 6th, century, cyrus, the, great, introduced, coins, to, the, persian, empire, after, 546, bc, following, his, conquest, of, lydia, and, the, defeat, of, its, king, croesus, who, had, put, in, place, the, first, coinage, in, history, with, his, conquest, of, lydia, cyrus, acquired, a, region, in, which, coinage, was, invented, developed, through, advanced, metallurgy, and, had, already, been, in, circulation, for, about, 50, years, making, the, lydian, kingdom, one, of, the, leading, trade, powers, of, the, time, it, seems, cyrus, initially, adopted, the, lydian, coinage, as, such, and, continued, to, strike, lydia, s, lion, and, bull, coinage, original, coins, of, the, achaemenid, empire, were, issued, from, 520, bc, 450, bc, to, 330, bc, the, persian, daric, was, the, first, truly, achaemenid, gold, coin, which, along, with, a, similar, silver, coin, the, siglos, represented, the, bimetallic, monetary, standard, of, the, achaemenid, persian, empire, the, achaemenid, empire, already, reached, the, doors, of, india, during, the, original, expansion, of, cyrus, the, great, and, the, achaemenid, conquest, of, the, indus, valley, is, dated, to, c, 515, bc, under, darius, i, an, achaemenid, administration, was, established, in, the, area, the, kabul, hoard, also, called, the, chaman, hazouri, hoard, is, a, coin, hoard, discovered, in, the, vicinity, of, kabul, afghanistan, containing, numerous, achaemenid, coins, as, well, as, many, greek, coins, from, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, the, deposit, of, the, hoard, is, dated, to, the, achaemenid, period, in, approximately, 380, bc, the, hoard, also, contained, many, locally, produced, silver, coins, minted, by, local, authorities, under, achaemenid, rule, several, of, these, issues, follow, the, western, designs, of, the, facing, bull, heads, a, stag, or, persian, column, capitals, on, the, obverse, and, incuse, punch, on, the, reverse, according, to, numismatist, joe, cribb, these, finds, suggest, that, the, idea, of, coinage, and, the, use, of, punch, marked, techniques, was, introduced, to, india, from, the, achaemenid, empire, during, the, 4th, century, bc, more, achaemenid, coins, were, also, found, in, pushkalavati, and, in, bhir, mound, according, to, aristotle, fr, 611, 37, ed, v, rose, and, pollux, onamastikon, ix, 83, the, first, issuer, of, greek, coinage, was, hermodike, of, kyme, a, small, percentage, of, early, lydian, greek, coins, have, a, legend, the, most, ancient, inscribed, coin, known, is, from, nearby, caria, this, coin, has, a, greek, legend, reading, phaenos, emi, sema, interpreted, variously, as, i, am, the, badge, of, phanes, or, i, am, the, sign, of, light, the, phanes, coins, are, among, the, earliest, of, greek, coins, a, hemihekte, of, the, issue, was, found, in, the, foundation, deposit, of, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesos, the, oldest, deposit, of, electrum, coins, discovered, one, assumption, is, that, phanes, was, a, mercenary, mentioned, by, herodotus, another, that, this, coin, is, associated, with, the, primeval, god, phanes, or, phanes, might, have, been, an, epithet, of, the, local, goddess, identified, with, artemis, barclay, v, head, found, these, suggestions, unlikely, and, thought, it, more, probably, the, name, of, some, prominent, citizen, of, ephesus, another, candidate, for, the, site, of, the, earliest, coins, is, aegina, where, chelone, turtle, coins, were, first, minted, c, 700, bc, coins, from, athens, and, corinth, appeared, shortly, thereafter, known, to, exist, at, least, since, the, late, 6th, century, bc, the, classical, period, saw, greek, coinage, reach, a, high, level, of, technical, and, aesthetic, quality, larger, cities, now, produced, a, range, of, fine, silver, and, gold, coins, most, bearing, a, portrait, of, their, patron, god, or, goddess, or, a, legendary, hero, on, one, side, and, a, symbol, of, the, city, on, the, other, some, coins, employed, a, visual, pun, some, coins, from, rhodes, featured, a, rose, since, the, greek, word, for, rose, is, rhodon, the, use, of, inscriptions, on, coins, also, began, usually, the, name, of, the, issuing, city, the, wealthy, cities, of, sicily, produced, some, especially, fine, coins, the, large, silver, decadrachm, 10, drachm, coin, from, syracuse, is, regarded, by, many, collectors, as, the, finest, coin, produced, in, the, ancient, world, perhaps, ever, syracusan, issues, were, rather, standard, in, their, imprints, one, side, bearing, the, head, of, the, nymph, arethusa, and, the, other, usually, a, victorious, quadriga, the, tyrants, of, syracuse, were, fabulously, rich, and, part, of, their, public, relations, policy, was, to, fund, quadrigas, for, the, olympic, chariot, race, a, very, expensive, undertaking, as, they, were, often, able, to, finance, more, than, one, quadriga, at, a, time, they, were, frequent, victors, in, this, highly, prestigious, event, syracuse, was, one, of, the, epicenters, of, numismatic, art, during, the, classical, period, led, by, the, engravers, kimon, and, euainetos, syracuse, produced, some, of, the, finest, coin, designs, of, antiquity, amongst, the, first, centers, to, produce, coins, during, the, greek, colonization, of, southern, italy, the, so, called, magna, graecia, were, paestum, crotone, sybaris, caulonia, metapontum, and, taranto, these, ancient, cities, started, producing, coins, from, 550, bc, to, 510, bc, amisano, in, a, general, publication, including, the, etruscan, coinage, attributing, it, the, beginning, to, c, 560, bc, in, populonia, a, chronology, that, would, leave, out, the, contribution, of, the, greeks, of, magna, graecia, and, attribute, to, the, etruscans, the, burden, of, introducing, the, coin, in, italy, in, this, work, constant, reference, is, made, to, classical, sources, and, credit, is, given, to, the, origin, of, the, etruscan, lydia, a, source, supported, by, herodotus, and, also, to, the, invention, of, coin, in, lydia, although, many, of, the, first, coins, illustrated, the, images, of, various, gods, the, first, portraiture, of, actual, rulers, appears, with, the, coinage, of, lycia, in, the, 5th, century, bc, no, ruler, had, dared, illustrating, his, own, portrait, on, coinage, until, that, time, the, achaemenids, had, been, the, first, to, illustrate, the, person, of, their, king, or, a, hero, in, a, stereotypical, manner, showing, a, bust, or, the, full, body, but, never, an, actual, portrait, on, their, sigloi, and, daric, coinage, from, c, 500, bc, a, slightly, earlier, candidate, for, the, first, portrait, coin, is, themistocles, the, athenian, general, who, became, a, governor, of, magnesia, on, the, meander, c, 465, 459, bc, for, the, achaemenid, empire, although, there, is, some, question, as, to, whether, his, coins, may, have, represented, zeus, rather, than, himself, themistocles, may, have, been, in, a, unique, position, in, which, he, could, transfer, the, notion, of, individual, portraiture, already, current, in, the, greek, world, and, at, the, same, time, wield, the, dynastic, power, of, an, achaemenid, dynasty, who, could, issue, his, own, coins, and, illustrate, them, as, he, wished, from, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, portraiture, of, the, issuing, ruler, would, then, become, a, standard, generalized, feature, of, coinage, the, karshapana, is, the, earliest, punch, marked, coin, found, in, india, produced, from, at, least, the, mid, 4th, century, bc, and, possibly, as, early, as, 575, bc, influenced, by, similar, coins, produced, in, gandhara, under, the, achaemenid, empire, such, as, those, of, the, kabul, hoard, or, other, examples, found, at, pushkalavati, and, in, bhir, mound, in, china, early, round, coins, appeared, in, the, 4th, century, bc, and, were, adopted, for, all, china, by, emperor, qin, shi, huang, di, at, the, end, of, 3rd, century, bc, the, round, coin, the, precursor, of, the, familiar, cash, coin, circulated, in, both, the, spade, and, knife, money, areas, in, the, zhou, period, from, around, 350, bc, apart, from, two, small, and, presumably, late, coins, from, the, state, of, qin, coins, from, the, spade, money, area, have, a, round, hole, and, refer, to, the, jin, and, liang, units, those, from, the, knife, money, area, have, a, square, hole, and, are, denominated, in, hua, although, for, discussion, purposes, the, zhou, coins, are, divided, up, into, categories, of, knives, spades, and, round, coins, it, is, apparent, from, archaeological, finds, that, most, of, the, various, kinds, circulated, together, a, hoard, found, in, 1981, near, hebi, in, north, henan, province, consisted, of, 3, 537, gong, spades, 3, anyi, arched, foot, spades, 8, liang, dang, lie, spades, 18, liang, square, foot, spades, and, 1, 180, yuan, round, coins, all, contained, in, three, clay, jars, the, hellenistic, period, was, characterized, by, the, spread, of, greek, culture, across, a, large, part, of, the, known, world, greek, speaking, kingdoms, were, established, in, egypt, and, syria, and, for, a, time, also, in, iran, and, as, far, east, as, what, is, now, afghanistan, and, northwestern, india, greek, traders, spread, greek, coins, across, this, vast, area, and, the, new, kingdoms, soon, began, to, produce, their, own, coins, because, these, kingdoms, were, much, larger, and, wealthier, than, the, greek, city, states, of, the, classical, period, their, coins, tended, to, be, more, mass, produced, as, well, as, larger, and, more, frequently, in, gold, they, often, lacked, the, aesthetic, delicacy, of, coins, of, the, earlier, period, still, some, of, the, greco, bactrian, coins, and, those, of, their, successors, in, india, the, indo, greeks, are, considered, the, finest, examples, of, greek, numismatic, art, with, a, nice, blend, of, realism, and, idealization, including, the, largest, coins, to, be, minted, in, the, hellenistic, world, the, largest, gold, coin, was, minted, by, eucratides, reigned, 171, 145, bc, the, largest, silver, coin, by, the, indo, greek, king, amyntas, nikator, reigned, c, 95, 90, bc, the, portraits, show, a, degree, of, individuality, never, matched, by, the, often, bland, depictions, of, their, royal, contemporaries, further, west, roger, ling, greece, and, the, hellenistic, world, coinage, followed, greek, colonization, and, influence, first, around, the, mediterranean, and, soon, after, to, north, africa, including, egypt, syria, persia, and, the, balkans, coins, came, late, to, the, roman, republic, compared, with, the, rest, of, the, mediterranean, especially, greece, and, asia, minor, where, coins, were, invented, in, the, 7th, century, bc, the, currency, of, central, italy, was, influenced, by, its, natural, resources, with, bronze, being, abundant, the, etruscans, were, famous, metal, workers, in, bronze, and, iron, and, silver, ore, being, scarce, the, coinage, of, the, roman, republic, started, with, a, few, silver, coins, apparently, devised, for, trade, with, celtic, in, northern, italy, and, the, greek, colonies, in, southern, italy, and, heavy, cast, bronze, pieces, for, use, in, central, italy, the, first, roman, coins, which, were, crude, heavy, cast, bronzes, were, issued, c, 289, bc, amisano, in, a, general, publication, including, the, etruscan,

of, significant, debasement, in, 1340, 60, and, 1417, 29, when, no, small, coins, were, minted, and, by, the, 15th, century, the, issuance, of, small, coin, was, further, restricted, by, government,

until, the, 19th, century, and, is, considered, the, ancestor, of, the, united, states, dollar, at, the, same, time, the, mexican, mint, was, established, on, may, 11, 1535, by, order, of, the, spanish, king, following, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, opened, in, april, 1536, this, mint, had, the, right, to, mint, silver, spanish, real, which, became, the, basis, of, the, monetary, system, of, the, spanish, empire, louis, xiii, had, the, louis, d, or, minted, in, 1640, to, compete, with, these, coins, the, first, attested, siege, coins, appeared, at, the, siege, of, pavia, in, 1524, auxiliary, coins, consisted, among, the, greeks, and, romans, as, in, our, modern, societies, of, coins, strongly, linked, to, copper, in, particular, the, red, copper, alloy, was, used, for, its, physical, properties, suitable, for, objects, constantly, subjected, to, manipulation, malleability, resistance, to, impacts, wear, and, corrosion, only, gold, has, better, resistance, to, corrosion, this, alloy, was, often, mixed, with, a, little, tin, zinc, and, especially, nickel, for, their, anti, corrosive, ductile, and, anti, fouling, properties, most, coins, presently, are, made, of, a, base, metal, and, their, value, comes, from, their, status, as, fiat, money, this, means, that, the, value, of, the, coin, is, established, by, law, and, thus, is, determined, by, the, free, market, only, in, as, much, as, national, currencies, are, used, in, domestic, trade, and, also, traded, in, the, international, market, thus, these, coins, are, monetary, tokens, just, as, paper, currency, is, their, value, is, usually, not, backed, by, metal, but, rather, by, some, form, of, government, guarantee, thus, there, is, very, little, economic, difference, between, notes, and, coins, of, equivalent, face, value, coins, may, be, in, circulation, with, face, values, lower, than, the, value, of, their, component, metals, but, they, are, never, initially, issued, with, such, value, and, the, shortfall, only, arises, over, time, due, to, inflation, as, market, values, for, the, metal, overtake, the, face, value, of, the, coin, examples, are, the, pre, 1965, us, dime, quarter, half, dollar, and, dollar, containing, slightly, less, than, a, tenth, quarter, half, and, full, ounce, of, silver, respectively, us, nickel, and, pre, 1982, us, penny, as, a, result, of, the, increase, in, the, value, of, copper, the, united, states, greatly, reduced, the, amount, of, copper, in, each, penny, since, mid, 1982, united, states, pennies, are, made, of, 97, 5, zinc, with, the, remaining, 2, 5, being, a, coating, of, copper, extreme, differences, between, face, values, and, metal, values, of, coins, cause, coins, to, be, hoarded, or, removed, from, circulation, by, illicit, smelters, in, order, to, realize, the, value, of, their, metal, content, this, is, an, example, of, gresham, s, law, the, united, states, mint, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, this, implemented, new, interim, rules, on, december, 14, 2006, subject, to, public, comment, for, 30, days, which, criminalized, the, melting, and, export, of, pennies, and, nickels, violators, can, be, fined, up, to, 10, 000, and, or, imprisoned, for, up, to, five, years, a, coin, s, value, as, a, collector, s, item, or, as, an, investment, generally, depends, on, its, condition, specific, historical, significance, rarity, quality, beauty, of, the, design, and, general, popularity, with, collectors, if, a, coin, is, greatly, lacking, in, all, of, these, it, is, unlikely, to, be, worth, much, the, value, of, bullion, coins, is, also, influenced, to, some, extent, by, those, factors, but, is, largely, based, on, the, value, of, their, gold, silver, or, platinum, content, sometimes, non, monetized, bullion, coins, such, as, the, canadian, maple, leaf, and, the, american, gold, eagle, are, minted, with, nominal, face, values, less, than, the, value, of, the, metal, in, them, but, as, such, coins, are, never, intended, for, circulation, these, face, values, have, no, relevance, collector, catalogs, often, include, information, about, coins, to, assists, collectors, with, identifying, and, grading, additional, resources, can, be, found, online, for, collectors, these, are, collector, clubs, collection, management, tools, marketplaces, trading, platforms, and, forums, coins, can, be, used, as, creative, media, of, expression, from, fine, art, sculpture, to, the, penny, machines, that, can, be, found, in, most, amusement, parks, in, the, code, of, federal, regulations, cfr, in, the, united, states, there, are, some, regulations, specific, to, nickels, and, pennies, that, are, informative, on, this, topic, 31, cfr, 82, 1, forbids, unauthorized, persons, from, exporting, melting, or, treating, any, 5, or, 1, cent, coins, this, has, been, a, particular, problem, with, nickels, and, dimes, and, with, some, comparable, coins, in, other, currencies, because, of, their, relatively, low, face, value, and, unstable, commodity, prices, for, a, while, the, copper, in, us, pennies, was, worth, more, than, one, cent, so, people, would, hoard, pennies, and, then, melt, them, down, for, their, metal, value, it, cost, more, than, face, value, to, manufacture, pennies, or, nickels, so, any, widespread, loss, of, the, coins, in, circulation, could, be, expensive, for, the, us, treasury, this, was, more, of, a, problem, when, coins, were, still, made, of, precious, metals, like, silver, and, gold, so, strict, laws, against, alteration, make, more, sense, historically, 31, cfr, 82, 2, b, goes, on, to, state, that, the, prohibition, contained, in, 82, 1, against, the, treatment, of, 5, cent, coins, and, one, cent, coins, shall, not, apply, to, the, treatment, of, these, coins, for, educational, amusement, novelty, jewelry, and, similar, purposes, as, long, as, the, volumes, treated, and, the, nature, of, the, treatment, makes, it, clear, that, such, treatment, is, not, intended, as, a, means, by, which, to, profit, solely, from, the, value, of, the, metal, content, of, the, coins, throughout, history, monarchs, and, governments, have, often, created, more, coinage, than, their, supply, of, precious, metals, would, allow, if, the, coins, were, pure, metal, by, replacing, some, fraction, of, a, coin, s, precious, metal, content, with, a, base, metal, often, copper, or, nickel, the, intrinsic, value, of, each, individual, coin, was, reduced, thereby, debasing, the, money, allowing, the, coining, authority, to, produce, more, coins, than, would, otherwise, be, possible, debasement, occasionally, occurs, in, order, to, make, the, coin, physically, harder, and, therefore, less, likely, to, be, worn, down, as, quickly, but, the, more, usual, reason, is, to, profit, from, the, difference, between, face, value, and, metal, value, debasement, of, money, almost, always, leads, to, price, inflation, sometimes, price, controls, are, at, the, same, time, also, instituted, by, the, governing, authority, but, historically, these, have, generally, proved, unworkable, the, united, states, is, unusual, in, that, it, has, only, slightly, modified, its, coinage, system, except, for, the, images, and, symbols, on, the, coins, which, have, changed, a, number, of, times, to, accommodate, two, centuries, of, inflation, the, one, cent, coin, has, changed, little, since, 1856, though, its, composition, was, changed, in, 1982, to, remove, virtually, all, copper, from, the, coin, and, still, remains, in, circulation, despite, a, greatly, reduced, purchasing, power, on, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, the, largest, coin, in, common, circulation, is, valued, at, 25, cents, a, very, low, value, for, the, largest, denomination, coin, compared, to, many, other, countries, increases, in, the, prices, of, copper, nickel, and, zinc, meant, that, both, the, us, one, and, five, cent, coins, became, worth, more, for, their, raw, metal, content, than, their, face, fiat, value, in, particular, copper, one, cent, pieces, those, dated, prior, to, 1982, and, some, 1982, dated, coins, contained, about, two, cents, worth, of, copper, some, denominations, of, circulating, coins, that, were, formerly, minted, in, the, united, states, are, no, longer, made, these, include, coins, with, a, face, value, of, a, half, cent, two, cents, three, cents, and, twenty, cents, the, half, dollar, and, dollar, coins, are, still, produced, but, mostly, for, vending, machines, and, collectors, in, the, past, the, us, also, coined, the, following, denominations, for, circulation, in, gold, one, dollar, 2, 50, three, dollars, five, dollars, ten, dollars, and, twenty, dollars, in, addition, cents, were, originally, slightly, larger, than, the, modern, quarter, and, weighed, nearly, half, an, ounce, while, five, cent, coins, known, then, as, half, dimes, were, smaller, than, a, dime, and, made, of, a, silver, alloy, dollar, coins, were, also, much, larger, and, weighed, approximately, an, ounce, one, dollar, gold, coins, are, no, longer, produced, and, rarely, used, the, us, also, issues, bullion, and, commemorative, coins, with, the, following, denominations, 50, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and, 100, circulating, coins, commonly, suffered, from, shaving, or, clipping, the, public, would, cut, off, small, amounts, of, precious, metal, from, their, edges, to, sell, it, and, then, pass, on, the, mutilated, coins, at, full, value, unmilled, british, sterling, silver, coins, were, sometimes, reduced, to, almost, half, their, minted, weight, this, form, of, debasement, in, tudor, england, was, commented, on, by, sir, thomas, gresham, whose, name, was, later, attached, to, gresham, s, law, the, monarch, would, have, to, periodically, recall, circulating, coins, paying, only, the, bullion, value, of, the, silver, and, reminting, them, this, also, known, as, recoinage, is, a, long, and, difficult, process, that, was, done, only, occasionally, many, coins, have, milled, or, reeded, edges, originally, designed, to, make, it, easier, to, detect, clipping, some, convicted, criminals, from, the, british, isles, who, were, sentenced, to, transportation, to, australia, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, used, coins, to, leave, messages, of, remembrance, to, loved, ones, left, behind, in, britain, the, coins, were, defaced, smoothed, and, inscribed, either, by, stippling, or, engraving, with, sometimes, touching, words, of, loss, these, coins, were, called, convict, love, tokens, or, leaden, hearts, some, of, these, tokens, are, in, the, collection, of, the, national, museum, of, australia, the, side, of, a, coin, carrying, an, image, of, a, monarch, other, authority, see, list, of, people, on, coins, or, a, national, emblem, is, called, the, obverse, colloquially, heads, the, other, side, carrying, various, types, of, information, is, called, the, reverse, colloquially, tails, the, year, of, minting, is, usually, shown, on, the, obverse, although, some, chinese, coins, most, canadian, coins, the, pre, 2008, british, 20p, coin, the, post, 1999, american, quarter, and, all, japanese, coins, are, exceptions, the, relation, of, the, images, on, the, obverse, and, reverse, of, a, coin, is, the, coin, s, orientation, if, the, image, on, the, obverse, of, the, coin, is, right, side, up, and, turning, the, coin, left, or, right, on, its, vertical, axis, reveals, that, the, reverse, of, the, coin, is, also, right, side, up, then, the, coin, is, said, to, have, medallic, orientation, typical, of, the, euro, and, pound, sterling, if, however, turning, the, coin, left, or, right, shows, that, the, reverse, image, is, upside, down, then, the, coin, is, said, to, have, coin, orientation, characteristic, of, the, coins, of, the, united, states, dollar, bimetallic, coins, are, sometimes, used, for, higher, values, and, for, commemorative, purposes, in, the, 1990s, france, used, a, tri, metallic, coin, common, circulating, bimetallic, examples, include, the, 1, 2, british, 1, 2, and, canadian, 2, and, several, peso, coins, in, mexico, the, exergue, is, the, space, on, a, coin, beneath, the, main, design, often, used, to, show, the, coin, s, date, although, it, is, sometimes, left, blank, or, contains, a, mint, mark, privy, mark, or, some, other, decorative, or, informative, design, feature, many, coins, do, not, have, an, exergue, at, all, especially, those, with, few, or, no, legends, such, as, the, victorian, bun, penny, not, all, coins, are, round, they, come, in, a, variety, of, shapes, the, australian, 50, cent, coin, for, example, has, twelve, flat, sides, some, coins, have, wavy, edges, e, g, the, 2, and, 20, cent, coins, of, hong, kong, and, the, 10, cent, coins, of, bahamas, some, are, square, shaped, such, as, the, 15, cent, coin, of, the, bahamas, and, the, 50, cent, coin, from, aruba, during, the, 1970s, swazi, coins, were, minted, in, several, shapes, including, squares, polygons, and, wavy, edged, circles, with, 8, and, 12, waves, some, other, coins, like, the, british, 20, and, 50, pence, coins, and, the, canadian, loonie, have, an, odd, number, of, sides, with, the, edges, rounded, off, this, way, the, coin, has, a, constant, diameter, recognizable, by, vending, machines, whichever, direction, it, is, inserted, a, triangular, coin, with, a, face, value, of, 5, produced, to, commemorate, the, 2007, 2008, tutankhamun, exhibition, at, the, o2, arena, was, commissioned, by, the, isle, of, man, it, became, legal, tender, on, 6, december, 2007, other, triangular, coins, issued, earlier, include, cabinda, coin, bermuda, coin, 2, dollar, cook, islands, 1992, triangular, coin, uganda, millennium, coin, and, polish, sterling, silver, 10, zloty, coin, some, medieval, coins, called, bracteates, were, so, thin, they, were, struck, on, only, one, side, many, coins, over, the, years, have, been, manufactured, with, integrated, holes, such, as, chinese, cash, coins, japanese, coins, colonial, french, coins, etc, this, may, have, been, done, to, permit, their, being, strung, on, cords, to, facilitate, storage, and, being, carried, nowadays, holes, help, to, differentiate, coins, of, similar, size, and, metal, such, as, the, japanese, 50, yen, and, 100, yen, coin, the, royal, canadian, mint, is, now, able, to, produce, holographic, effect, gold, and, silver, coinage, however, this, procedure, is, not, limited, to, only, bullion, or, commemorative, coinage, the, 500, yen, coin, from, japan, was, subject, to, a, massive, amount, of, counterfeiting, the, japanese, government, in, response, produced, a, circulatory, coin, with, a, holographic, image, the, royal, canadian, mint, has, also, released, several, coins, that, are, colored, the, first, of, which, was, in, commemoration, of, remembrance, day, the, subject, was, a, colored, poppy, on, the, reverse, of, a, 25, cent, piece, minted, through, a, patented, process, an, example, of, non, metallic, composite, coins, sometimes, incorrectly, called, plastic, coins, was, introduced, into, circulation, in, transnistria, on, 22, august, 2014, most, of, these, coins, are, also, non, circular, with, different, shapes, corresponding, to, different, coin, values, for, a, list, of, many, pure, metallic, elements, and, their, alloys, which, have, been, used, in, actual, circulation, coins, and, for, trial, experiments, see, coinage, metals, to, flip, a, coin, to, see, whether, it, lands, heads, or, tails, is, to, use, it, as, a, two, sided, die, in, what, is, known, in, mathematics, as, a, bernoulli, trial, if, the, probability, of, heads, in, the, parlance, of, bernoulli, trials, a, success, is, exactly, 0, 5, the, coin, is, fair, coins, can, also, be, spun, on, a, flat, surface, such, as, a, table, this, results, in, the, following, phenomenon, as, the, coin, falls, over, and, rolls, on, its, edge, it, spins, faster, and, faster, formally, the, precession, rate, of, the, symmetry, axis, of, the, coin, i, e, the, axis, passing, from, one, face, of, the, coin, to, the, other, before, coming, to, an, abrupt, stop, this, is, mathematically, modeled, as, a, finite, time, singularity, the, precession, rate, is, accelerating, to, infinity, before, it, suddenly, stops, and, has, been, studied, using, high, speed, photography, and, devices, such, as, euler, s, disk, the, slowing, down, is, predominantly, caused, by, rolling, friction, air, resistance, is, minor, and, the, singularity, divergence, of, the, precession, rate, can, be, modeled, as, a, power, law, with, exponent, approximately, 1, 3, iron, and, copper, coins, have, a, characteristic, metallic, smell, that, is, produced, upon, contact, with, oils, in, the, skin, perspiration, is, chemically, reduced, upon, contact, with, these, metals, which, causes, the, skin, oils, to, decompose, forming, with, iron, the, volatile, molecule, 1, octen, 3, one, in, the, philippines, small, engraved, gold, coins, called, piloncitos, have, been, excavated, some, as, lightweight, as, 0, 09, to, 2, 65, grams, piloncitos, have, been, unearthed, from, mandaluyong, bataan, the, banks, of, the, pasig, river, batangas, marinduque, samar, leyte, and, some, areas, in, mindanao, large, quantities, were, found, in, indonesian, archaeological, sites, suggesting, that, they, may, not, have, originated, in, the, philippines, but, rather, were, imported, however, numerous, spanish, accounts, state, that, the, gold, coins, were, mined, and, made, in, the, philippines, such, as, the, following, from, 1586, the, people, of, this, island, luzon, are, very, skillful, in, their, handling, of, gold, they, weigh, it, with, the, greatest, skill, and, delicacy, that, have, ever, been, seen, the, first, thing, they, teach, their, children, is, the, knowledge, of, gold, and, the, weights, with, which, they, weigh, it, for, there, is, no, other, money, among, them, the, term, piloncitos, is, a, contemporary, word, used, by, modern, day, antique, collectors, who, thought, that, the, cone, shaped, pieces, looked, like, a, pilon, of, sugar, early, historical, descriptions, of, the, term, include, the, spanish, granitas, de, oro, small, grains, of, gold, or, simply, by, whatever, local, language, terms, were, used, to, mean, gold, in, those, times, such, as, bulawan, piloncitos, are, presumably, an, offshoot, of, silver, coinage, and, may, have, evolved, into, the, bullet, or, pod, duang, coinage, of, sukhothai, in, thailand, early, historical, records, document, the, extensive, use, of, gold, throughout, the, philippine, archipelago, before, the, arrival, of, european, colonists, it, was, used, extensively, as, currency, and, also, used, in, everyday, items, such, as, clothing, and, finery
