list, of, forms, of, government, a, nation, state, is, a, political, unit, where, the, state, a, centralized, political, organization, ruling, over, a, population, within, a, territory, and, the, nation, a, community, based, on, a, common, identity, are, congruent, it, is, a, more, precise, concept, than, country, since, a, country, does, not, need, to, have, a, predominant, national, or, ethnic, group, a, nation, sometimes, used, in, the, sense, of, a, common, ethnicity, may, include, a, diaspora, or, refugees, who, live, outside, the, nation, state, some, nations, of, this, sense, do, not, have, a, state, where, that, ethnicity, predominates, in, a, more, general, sense, a, nation, state, is, simply, a, large, politically, sovereign, country, or, administrative, territory, a, nation, state, may, be, contrasted, with, this, article, mainly, discusses, the, more, specific, definition, of, a, nation, state, as, a, typically, sovereign, country, dominated, by, a, particular, ethnicity, the, relationship, between, a, nation, in, the, ethnic, sense, and, a, state, can, be, complex, the, presence, of, a, state, can, encourage, ethnogenesis, and, a, group, with, a, pre, existing, ethnic, identity, can, influence, the, drawing, of, territorial, boundaries, or, argue, for, political, legitimacy, this, definition, of, a, nation, state, is, not, universally, accepted, all, attempts, to, develop, terminological, consensus, around, nation, failed, concludes, academic, valery, tishkov, walker, connor, discusses, the, impressions, surrounding, the, characters, of, nation, sovereign, state, nation, state, and, nationalism, connor, who, gave, the, term, ethnonationalism, wide, currency, also, discusses, the, tendency, to, confuse, nation, and, state, and, the, treatment, of, all, states, as, if, nation, states, the, origins, and, early, history, of, nation, states, are, disputed, a, major, theoretical, question, is, which, came, first, the, nation, or, the, nation, state, scholars, such, as, steven, weber, david, woodward, michel, foucault, and, jeremy, black, have, advanced, the, hypothesis, that, the, nation, state, did, not, arise, out, of, political, ingenuity, or, an, unknown, undetermined, source, nor, was, it, a, political, invention, but, is, an, inadvertent, byproduct, of, 15th, century, intellectual, discoveries, in, political, economy, capitalism, mercantilism, political, geography, and, geography, combined, with, cartography, and, advances, in, map, making, technologies, it, was, with, these, intellectual, discoveries, and, technological, advances, that, the, nation, state, arose, for, others, the, nation, existed, first, then, nationalist, movements, arose, for, sovereignty, and, the, nation, state, was, created, to, meet, that, demand, some, modernization, theories, of, nationalism, see, it, as, a, product, of, government, policies, to, unify, and, modernize, an, already, existing, state, most, theories, see, the, nation, state, as, a, 19th, century, european, phenomenon, facilitated, by, developments, such, as, state, mandated, education, mass, literacy, and, mass, media, however, historians, also, note, the, early, emergence, of, a, relatively, unified, state, and, identity, in, portugal, and, the, dutch, republic, eric, hobsbawm, argues, that, the, establishment, of, a, french, nation, was, not, the, result, of, french, nationalism, which, would, not, emerge, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, but, rather, the, policies, implemented, by, pre, existing, french, states, many, of, these, reforms, were, implemented, since, the, french, revolution, at, which, time, only, half, of, the, french, people, spoke, some, french, with, only, a, quarter, of, those, speaking, the, version, of, it, found, in, literature, and, places, of, learning, as, the, number, of, italian, speakers, in, italy, was, even, lower, at, the, time, of, italian, unification, similar, arguments, have, been, made, regarding, the, modern, italian, nation, with, both, the, french, and, italian, states, promoting, the, replacement, of, various, regional, dialects, and, languages, with, standardized, dialects, the, introduction, of, conscription, and, the, third, republic, s, 1880s, laws, on, public, instruction, facilitated, the, creation, of, a, national, identity, under, this, theory, some, nation, states, such, as, germany, and, italy, came, into, existence, at, least, partly, as, a, result, of, political, campaigns, by, nationalists, during, the, 19th, century, in, both, cases, the, territory, was, previously, divided, among, other, states, some, very, small, at, first, the, sense, of, common, identity, was, a, cultural, movement, such, as, in, the, v, lkisch, movement, in, german, speaking, states, which, rapidly, acquired, a, political, significance, in, these, cases, the, nationalist, sentiment, and, the, nationalist, movement, precede, the, unification, of, the, german, and, italian, nation, states, historians, hans, kohn, liah, greenfeld, philip, white, and, others, have, classified, nations, such, as, germany, or, italy, where, they, believe, cultural, unification, preceded, state, unification, as, ethnic, nations, or, ethnic, nationalities, however, state, driven, national, unifications, such, as, in, france, england, or, china, are, more, likely, to, flourish, in, multiethnic, societies, producing, a, traditional, national, heritage, of, civic, nations, or, territory, based, nationalities, the, idea, of, a, nation, state, was, and, is, associated, with, the, rise, of, the, modern, system, of, states, often, called, the, westphalian, system, following, the, treaty, of, westphalia, 1648, the, balance, of, power, which, characterized, that, system, depended, for, its, effectiveness, upon, clearly, defined, centrally, controlled, independent, entities, whether, empires, or, nation, states, which, recognize, each, other, s, sovereignty, and, territory, the, westphalian, system, did, not, create, the, nation, state, but, the, nation, state, meets, the, criteria, for, its, component, states, by, assuming, that, there, is, no, disputed, territory, before, the, westphalian, system, the, closest, geopolitical, system, was, the, chanyuan, system, established, in, east, asia, in, 1005, through, the, treaty, of, chanyuan, which, like, the, westphalian, peace, treaties, designated, national, borders, between, the, independent, regimes, of, china, s, song, dynasty, and, the, semi, nomadic, liao, dynasty, this, system, was, copied, and, developed, in, east, asia, in, the, following, centuries, until, the, establishment, of, the, pan, eurasian, mongol, empire, in, the, 13th, century, the, nation, state, received, a, philosophical, underpinning, in, the, era, of, romanticism, at, first, as, the, natural, expression, of, the, individual, peoples, romantic, nationalism, see, johann, gottlieb, fichte, s, conception, of, the, volk, later, opposed, by, ernest, renan, the, increasing, emphasis, during, the, 19th, century, on, the, ethnic, and, racial, origins, of, the, nation, led, to, a, redefinition, of, the, nation, state, in, these, terms, racism, which, in, boulainvilliers, s, theories, was, inherently, anti, patriotic, and, antinationalist, joined, itself, with, colonialist, imperialism, and, continental, imperialism, most, notably, in, pan, germanic, and, pan, slavic, movements, the, relationship, between, racism, and, ethnic, nationalism, reached, its, height, in, the, 20th, century, through, fascism, and, nazism, the, specific, combination, of, nation, people, and, state, expressed, in, such, terms, as, the, v, lkische, staat, and, implemented, in, laws, such, as, the, 1935, nuremberg, laws, made, fascist, states, such, as, early, nazi, germany, qualitatively, different, from, non, fascist, nation, states, minorities, were, not, considered, part, of, the, people, volk, and, were, consequently, denied, to, have, an, authentic, or, legitimate, role, in, such, a, state, in, germany, neither, jews, nor, the, roma, were, considered, part, of, the, people, and, both, were, specifically, targeted, for, persecution, german, nationality, law, defined, german, based, on, german, ancestry, excluding, all, non, germans, from, the, people, in, recent, years, a, nation, state, s, claim, to, absolute, sovereignty, within, its, borders, has, been, criticized, a, global, political, system, based, on, international, agreements, and, supra, national, blocs, characterized, the, post, war, era, non, state, actors, such, as, international, corporations, and, non, governmental, organizations, are, widely, seen, as, eroding, the, economic, and, political, power, of, nation, states, according, to, andreas, wimmer, and, yuval, feinstein, nation, states, tended, to, emerge, when, power, shifts, allowed, nationalists, to, overthrow, existing, regimes, or, absorb, existing, administrative, units, xue, li, and, alexander, hicks, links, the, frequency, of, nation, state, creation, to, processes, of, diffusion, that, emanate, from, international, organizations, in, europe, during, the, 18th, century, the, classic, non, national, states, were, the, multiethnic, empires, the, austrian, empire, the, kingdom, of, france, and, its, empire, the, kingdom, of, hungary, the, russian, empire, the, portuguese, empire, the, spanish, empire, the, ottoman, empire, the, british, empire, the, dutch, empire, and, smaller, nations, at, what, would, now, be, called, sub, state, level, the, multi, ethnic, empire, was, an, absolute, monarchy, ruled, by, a, king, emperor, or, sultan, the, population, belonged, to, many, ethnic, groups, and, they, spoke, many, languages, the, empire, was, dominated, by, one, ethnic, group, and, their, language, was, usually, the, language, of, public, administration, the, ruling, dynasty, was, usually, but, not, always, from, that, group, this, type, of, state, is, not, specifically, european, such, empires, existed, in, asia, africa, and, the, americas, chinese, dynasties, such, as, the, tang, dynasty, the, yuan, dynasty, and, the, qing, dynasty, were, all, multiethnic, regimes, governed, by, a, ruling, ethnic, group, in, the, three, examples, their, ruling, ethnic, groups, were, the, han, chinese, mongols, and, the, manchus, in, the, muslim, world, immediately, after, muhammad, died, in, 632, caliphates, were, established, caliphates, were, islamic, states, under, the, leadership, of, a, political, religious, successor, to, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, these, polities, developed, into, multi, ethnic, trans, national, empires, the, ottoman, sultan, selim, i, 1512, 1520, reclaimed, the, title, of, caliph, which, had, been, in, dispute, and, asserted, by, a, diversity, of, rulers, and, shadow, caliphs, in, the, centuries, of, the, abbasid, mamluk, caliphate, since, the, mongols, sacking, of, baghdad, and, the, killing, of, the, last, abbasid, caliph, in, baghdad, iraq, 1258, the, ottoman, caliphate, as, an, office, of, the, ottoman, empire, was, abolished, under, mustafa, kemal, atat, rk, in, 1924, as, part, of, atat, rk, s, reforms, some, of, the, smaller, european, states, were, not, so, ethnically, diverse, but, were, also, dynastic, states, ruled, by, a, royal, house, their, territory, could, expand, by, royal, intermarriage, or, merge, with, another, state, when, the, dynasty, merged, in, some, parts, of, europe, notably, germany, minimal, territorial, units, existed, they, were, recognized, by, their, neighbours, as, independent, and, had, their, government, and, laws, some, were, ruled, by, princes, or, other, hereditary, rulers, some, were, governed, by, bishops, or, abbots, because, they, were, so, small, however, they, had, no, separate, language, or, culture, the, inhabitants, shared, the, language, of, the, surrounding, region, in, some, cases, these, states, were, overthrown, by, nationalist, uprisings, in, the, 19th, century, liberal, ideas, of, free, trade, played, a, role, in, german, unification, which, was, preceded, by, a, customs, union, the, zollverein, however, the, austro, prussian, war, and, the, german, alliances, in, the, franco, prussian, war, were, decisive, in, the, unification, the, austro, hungarian, empire, and, the, ottoman, empire, broke, up, after, the, first, world, war, but, the, russian, empire, was, replaced, by, the, soviet, union, in, most, of, its, multinational, territory, after, the, russian, civil, war, a, few, of, the, smaller, states, survived, the, independent, principalities, of, liechtenstein, andorra, monaco, and, the, republic, of, san, marino, vatican, city, is, a, special, case, all, of, the, larger, papal, states, save, the, vatican, itself, were, occupied, and, absorbed, by, italy, by, 1870, the, resulting, roman, question, was, resolved, with, the, rise, of, the, modern, state, under, the, 1929, lateran, treaties, between, italy, and, the, holy, see, legitimate, states, that, govern, effectively, and, dynamic, industrial, economies, are, widely, regarded, today, as, the, defining, characteristics, of, a, modern, nation, state, nation, states, have, their, characteristics, differing, from, pre, national, states, for, a, start, they, have, a, different, attitude, to, their, territory, compared, to, dynastic, monarchies, it, is, semisacred, and, nontransferable, no, nation, would, swap, territory, with, other, states, simply, for, example, because, the, king, s, daughter, married, they, have, a, different, type, of, border, in, principle, defined, only, by, the, national, group, s, settlement, area, however, many, nation, states, also, sought, natural, borders, rivers, mountain, ranges, they, are, constantly, changing, in, population, size, and, power, because, of, the, limited, restrictions, of, their, borders, the, most, noticeable, characteristic, is, the, degree, to, which, nation, states, use, the, state, as, an, instrument, of, national, unity, in, economic, social, and, cultural, life, the, nation, state, promoted, economic, unity, by, abolishing, internal, customs, and, tolls, in, germany, that, process, the, creation, of, the, zollverein, preceded, formal, national, unity, nation, states, typically, have, a, policy, to, create, and, maintain, national, transportation, infrastructure, facilitating, trade, and, travel, in, 19th, century, europe, the, expansion, of, the, rail, transport, networks, was, at, first, largely, a, matter, for, private, railway, companies, but, gradually, came, under, the, control, of, the, national, governments, the, french, rail, network, with, its, main, lines, radiating, from, paris, to, all, corners, of, france, is, often, seen, as, a, reflection, of, the, centralised, french, nation, state, which, directed, its, construction, nation, states, continue, to, build, for, instance, specifically, national, motorway, networks, specifically, transnational, infrastructure, programmes, such, as, the, trans, european, networks, are, a, recent, innovation, the, nation, states, typically, had, a, more, centralised, and, uniform, public, administration, than, their, imperial, predecessors, they, were, smaller, and, the, population, was, less, diverse, the, internal, diversity, of, the, ottoman, empire, for, instance, was, very, great, after, the, 19th, century, triumph, of, the, nation, state, in, europe, regional, identity, was, subordinate, to, national, identity, in, regions, such, as, alsace, lorraine, catalonia, brittany, and, corsica, in, many, cases, the, regional, administration, was, also, subordinated, to, the, central, national, government, this, process, was, partially, reversed, from, the, 1970s, onward, with, the, introduction, of, various, forms, of, regional, autonomy, in, formerly, centralised, states, such, as, spain, or, italy, the, most, apparent, impact, of, the, nation, state, as, compared, to, its, non, national, predecessors, is, creating, a, uniform, national, culture, through, state, policy, the, model, of, the, nation, state, implies, that, its, population, constitutes, a, nation, united, by, a, common, descent, a, common, language, and, many, forms, of, shared, culture, when, implied, unity, was, absent, the, nation, state, often, tried, to, create, it, it, promoted, a, uniform, national, language, through, language, policy, the, creation, of, national, systems, of, compulsory, primary, education, and, a, relatively, uniform, curriculum, in, secondary, schools, was, the, most, effective, instrument, in, the, spread, of, the, national, languages, the, schools, also, taught, national, history, often, in, a, propagandistic, and, mythologised, version, and, especially, during, conflicts, some, nation, states, still, teach, this, kind, of, history, language, and, cultural, policy, was, sometimes, hostile, aimed, at, suppressing, non, national, elements, language, prohibitions, were, sometimes, used, to, accelerate, the, adoption, of, national, languages, and, the, decline, of, minority, languages, see, examples, anglicisation, bulgarization, croatization, czechization, dutchification, francisation, germanisation, hellenization, hispanicization, italianization, lithuanization, magyarisation, polonisation, russification, serbization, slovakisation, swedification, turkification, in, some, cases, these, policies, triggered, bitter, conflicts, and, further, ethnic, separatism, but, where, it, worked, the, cultural, uniformity, and, homogeneity, of, the, population, increased, conversely, the, cultural, divergence, at, the, border, became, sharper, in, theory, a, uniform, french, identity, extends, from, the, atlantic, coast, to, the, rhine, and, on, the, other, bank, of, the, rhine, a, uniform, german, identity, begins, both, sides, have, divergent, language, policy, and, educational, systems, to, enforce, that, model, the, notion, of, a, unifying, national, identity, also, extends, to, countries, that, host, multiple, ethnic, or, language, groups, such, as, india, for, example, switzerland, is, constitutionally, a, confederation, of, cantons, and, has, four, official, languages, still, it, also, has, a, swiss, national, identity, a, national, history, and, a, classic, national, hero, wilhelm, tell, innumerable, conflicts, have, arisen, where, political, boundaries, did, not, correspond, with, ethnic, or, cultural, boundaries, after, world, war, ii, in, the, josip, broz, tito, era, nationalism, was, appealed, to, for, uniting, south, slav, peoples, later, in, the, 20th, century, after, the, break, up, of, the, soviet, union, leaders, appealed, to, ancient, ethnic, feuds, or, tensions, that, ignited, conflict, between, the, serbs, croats, and, slovenes, as, well, as, bosniaks, montenegrins, and, macedonians, eventually, breaking, up, the, long, collaboration, of, peoples, ethnic, cleansing, was, carried, out, in, the, balkans, destroying, the, formerly, socialist, republic, and, producing, the, civil, wars, in, croatia, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, in, 1992, 95, resulting, in, mass, population, displacements, and, segregation, that, radically, altered, what, was, once, a, highly, diverse, and, intermixed, ethnic, makeup, of, the, region, these, conflicts, were, mainly, about, creating, a, new, political, framework, of, states, each, of, which, would, be, ethnically, and, politically, homogeneous, serbs, croats, and, bosniaks, insisted, they, were, ethnically, distinct, although, many, communities, had, a, long, history, of, intermarriage, belgium, is, a, classic, example, of, a, state, that, is, not, a, nation, state, the, state, was, formed, by, secession, from, the, united, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, in, 1830, whose, neutrality, and, integrity, was, protected, by, the, treaty, of, london, 1839, thus, it, served, as, a, buffer, state, after, the, napoleonic, wars, between, the, european, powers, france, prussia, after, 1871, the, german, empire, and, the, united, kingdom, until, world, war, i, when, the, germans, breached, its, neutrality, currently, belgium, is, divided, between, the, flemings, in, the, north, the, french, speaking, population, in, the, south, and, the, german, speaking, population, in, the, east, the, flemish, population, in, the, north, speaks, dutch, the, walloon, population, in, the, south, speaks, either, french, or, in, the, east, of, li, ge, province, german, the, brussels, population, speaks, french, or, dutch, the, flemish, identity, is, also, cultural, and, there, is, a, strong, separatist, movement, espoused, by, the, political, parties, the, right, wing, vlaams, belang, and, the, new, flemish, alliance, the, francophone, walloon, identity, of, belgium, is, linguistically, distinct, and, regionalist, there, is, also, unitary, belgian, nationalism, several, versions, of, a, greater, netherlands, ideal, and, a, german, speaking, community, of, belgium, annexed, from, germany, in, 1920, and, re, annexed, by, germany, in, 1940, 1944, however, these, ideologies, are, all, very, marginal, and, politically, insignificant, during, elections, china, covers, a, large, geographic, area, and, uses, the, concept, of, zhonghua, minzu, or, chinese, nationality, in, the, sense, of, ethnic, groups, still, it, also, officially, recognizes, the, majority, han, ethnic, group, which, accounts, for, over, 90, of, the, population, and, no, fewer, than, 55, ethnic, national, minorities, according, to, philip, g, roeder, moldova, is, an, example, of, a, soviet, era, segment, state, moldavian, ssr, where, the, nation, state, project, of, the, segment, state, trumped, the, nation, state, project, of, prior, statehood, in, moldova, despite, strong, agitation, from, university, faculty, and, students, for, reunification, with, romania, the, nation, state, project, forged, within, the, moldavian, ssr, trumped, the, project, for, a, return, to, the, interwar, nation, state, project, of, greater, romania, see, controversy, over, linguistic, and, ethnic, identity, in, moldova, for, further, details, israel, was, founded, as, a, jewish, state, in, 1948, its, basic, laws, describe, it, as, both, a, jewish, and, a, democratic, state, the, basic, law, israel, as, the, nation, state, of, the, jewish, people, 2018, explicitly, specifies, the, nature, of, the, state, of, israel, as, the, nation, state, of, the, jewish, people, according, to, the, israel, central, bureau, of, statistics, 75, 7, of, israel, s, population, are, jews, arabs, who, make, up, 20, 4, of, the, population, are, the, largest, ethnic, minority, in, israel, israel, also, has, very, small, communities, of, armenians, circassians, assyrians, samaritans, there, are, also, some, non, jewish, spouses, of, israeli, jews, however, these, communities, are, very, small, and, usually, number, only, in, the, hundreds, or, thousands, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, presents, an, unusual, example, in, which, one, kingdom, represents, four, distinct, countries, the, four, countries, of, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, are, each, is, expressly, designated, as, a, land, in, dutch, law, by, the, charter, for, the, kingdom, of, the, netherlands, unlike, the, german, l, nder, and, the, austrian, bundesl, nder, landen, is, consistently, translated, as, countries, by, the, dutch, government, while, historical, monarchies, often, brought, together, different, kingdoms, territories, ethnic, groups, under, the, same, crown, in, modern, nation, states, political, elites, seek, a, uniformity, of, the, population, leading, to, state, nationalism, in, the, case, of, the, christian, territories, of, the, future, spain, neighboring, al, andalus, there, was, an, early, perception, of, ethnicity, faith, and, shared, territory, in, the, middle, ages, 13th, 14th, centuries, as, documented, by, the, chronicle, of, muntaner, in, the, proposal, of, the, castilian, king, to, the, other, christian, kings, of, the, peninsula, if, these, four, kings, of, spain, whom, he, named, who, are, of, one, flesh, and, blood, held, together, little, need, they, fear, all, the, other, powers, of, the, world, after, the, dynastic, union, of, the, catholic, monarchs, in, the, 15th, century, the, spanish, monarchy, ruled, over, different, kingdoms, each, with, its, own, cultural, linguistic, and, political, particularities, and, the, kings, had, to, swear, by, the, laws, of, each, territory, before, the, respective, parliaments, forming, the, spanish, empire, at, this, time, the, hispanic, monarchy, had, its, maximum, territorial, expansion, after, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, rooted, in, the, political, position, of, the, count, duke, of, olivares, and, the, absolutism, of, philip, v, the, assimilation, of, the, crown, of, aragon, by, the, castilian, crown, through, the, decrees, of, nueva, planta, was, the, first, step, in, the, creation, of, the, spanish, nation, state, as, in, other, contemporary, european, states, political, union, was, the, first, step, in, the, creation, of, the, spanish, nation, state, in, this, case, not, on, a, uniform, ethnic, basis, but, through, the, imposition, of, the, political, and, cultural, characteristics, of, the, dominant, ethnic, group, in, this, case, the, castilians, over, those, of, other, ethnic, groups, who, became, national, minorities, to, be, assimilated, in, fact, since, the, political, unification, of, 1714, spanish, assimilation, policies, towards, catalan, speaking, territories, catalonia, valencia, the, balearic, islands, part, of, aragon, and, other, national, minorities, as, basques, and, galicians, have, been, a, historical, constant, the, process, of, assimilation, began, with, secret, instructions, to, the, corregidores, of, the, catalan, territory, they, will, take, the, utmost, care, to, introduce, the, castilian, language, for, which, purpose, he, will, give, the, most, temperate, and, disguised, measures, so, that, the, effect, is, achieved, without, the, care, being, noticed, from, there, actions, in, the, service, of, assimilation, discreet, or, aggressive, were, continued, and, reached, to, the, last, detail, such, as, in, 1799, the, royal, certificate, forbidding, anyone, to, represent, sing, and, dance, pieces, that, were, not, in, spanish, these, nationalist, policies, sometimes, very, aggressive, and, still, in, force, have, been, and, still, are, the, seed, of, repeated, territorial, conflicts, within, the, state, although, official, spanish, history, describes, a, natural, decline, of, the, catalan, language, and, increasing, replacement, by, spanish, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, especially, among, the, upper, classes, a, survey, of, language, usage, in, 1807, commissioned, by, napoleon, indicates, that, except, in, the, royal, courts, spanish, is, absent, from, everyday, life, it, is, indicated, that, catalan, is, taught, in, schools, printed, and, spoken, not, only, among, the, lower, class, but, also, among, people, of, first, quality, also, in, social, gatherings, as, in, visits, and, congresses, indicating, that, it, is, spoken, everywhere, except, in, the, royal, courts, he, also, indicates, that, catalan, is, also, spoken, in, the, kingdom, of, valencia, in, the, islands, of, mallorca, menorca, ibiza, sardinia, corsica, and, much, of, sicily, in, the, vall, of, aran, and, cerda, a, the, nationalization, process, accelerated, in, the, 19th, century, in, parallel, to, the, origin, of, spanish, nationalism, the, social, political, and, ideological, movement, that, tried, to, shape, a, spanish, national, identity, based, on, the, castilian, model, in, conflict, with, the, other, historical, nations, of, the, state, politicians, of, the, time, were, aware, that, despite, the, aggressive, policies, pursued, up, to, that, time, the, uniform, and, monocultural, spanish, nation, did, not, exist, as, indicated, in, 1835, by, antonio, alcal, galiano, when, in, the, cortes, del, estatuto, real, he, defended, the, effort, to, make, the, spanish, nation, a, nation, that, neither, is, nor, has, been, until, now, in, 1906, the, catalanist, party, solidaritat, catalana, was, founded, to, try, to, mitigate, the, economically, and, culturally, oppressive, treatment, of, spain, towards, the, catalans, one, of, the, responses, of, spanish, nationalism, came, from, the, military, state, with, statements, such, as, that, of, the, publication, la, correspondencia, militar, the, catalan, problem, is, not, solved, well, by, freedom, but, by, restriction, not, by, palliatives, and, pacts, but, by, iron, and, fire, another, came, from, important, spanish, intellectuals, such, pio, baroja, and, blasco, iba, ez, calling, the, catalans, jews, considered, a, serious, insult, at, that, time, when, racism, was, gaining, strength, building, the, nation, as, in, france, it, was, the, state, that, created, the, nation, and, not, the, opposite, process, is, an, ideal, that, the, spanish, elites, constantly, reiterated, and, one, hundred, years, later, than, alcal, galiano, for, example, we, can, also, find, it, in, the, mouth, of, the, fascist, jos, pemart, n, who, admired, the, german, and, italian, modeling, policies, there, is, an, intimate, and, decisive, dualism, both, in, italian, fascism, and, in, german, national, socialism, on, the, one, hand, the, hegelian, doctrine, of, the, absolutism, of, the, state, is, felt, the, state, originates, in, the, nation, educates, and, shapes, the, mentality, of, the, individual, is, in, mussolini, s, words, the, soul, of, the, soul, and, will, be, found, again, two, hundred, years, later, from, the, socialist, josep, borrell, the, modern, history, of, spain, is, an, unfortunate, history, that, meant, that, we, did, not, consolidate, a, modern, state, independenceists, think, that, the, nation, makes, the, state, i, think, the, opposite, the, state, makes, the, nation, a, strong, state, which, imposes, its, language, culture, education, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, first, half, of, that, century, have, seen, the, most, ethnic, violence, coinciding, with, a, racism, that, even, came, to, identify, states, with, races, in, the, case, of, spain, with, a, supposed, spanish, race, sublimated, in, castilian, of, which, national, minorities, were, degenerate, forms, and, the, first, of, those, that, needed, to, be, exterminated, there, were, even, public, proposals, for, the, repression, of, whole, catalonia, and, even, the, extermination, of, catalans, such, as, that, of, juan, pujol, head, of, press, and, propaganda, of, the, junta, de, defensa, nacional, during, the, spanish, civil, war, in, la, voz, de, espa, a, or, that, of, queipo, de, llano, in, a, radio, address, in, 1936, among, others, the, influence, of, spanish, nationalism, could, be, found, in, a, pogrom, in, argentina, during, the, tragic, week, in, 1919, it, was, called, to, attack, jews, and, catalans, indiscriminately, possibly, because, the, influence, of, spanish, nationalism, which, at, the, time, described, catalans, as, a, semitic, ethnicity, also, one, can, find, discourses, on, the, alienation, of, catalan, speakers, such, as, for, example, an, article, entitled, catalu, a, biling, e, by, men, ndez, pidal, in, which, he, defends, the, romanones, decree, against, the, catalan, language, published, in, el, imparcial, on, 15, december, 1902, there, they, will, see, that, the, courts, of, the, catalan, aragonese, confederation, never, had, catalan, as, their, official, language, that, the, kings, of, aragon, even, those, of, the, catalan, dynasty, used, catalan, only, in, catalonia, and, used, spanish, not, only, in, the, cortes, of, aragon, but, also, in, foreign, relations, the, same, with, castile, or, navarre, as, with, the, infidel, kings, of, granada, from, africa, or, asia, because, even, in, the, most, important, days, of, catalonia, spanish, prevailed, as, the, language, of, the, aragonese, kingdom, and, catalan, was, reserved, for, the, peculiar, affairs, of, the, catalan, county, or, the, article, los, catalanes, a, las, cortes, constituyentes, appeared, in, several, newspapers, among, others, el, dia, de, alicante, june, 23, 1931, el, porvenir, castellano, and, el, noticiero, de, soria, july, 2, 1931, in, the, heraldo, de, almeria, on, june, 4, 1931, sent, by, the, pro, justice, committee, with, a, post, office, box, in, madrid, the, catalanists, have, recently, declared, that, they, are, not, spanish, nor, do, they, want, to, be, nor, can, they, be, they, have, also, been, saying, for, a, long, time, that, they, are, an, oppressed, enslaved, exploited, people, it, is, imperative, to, do, them, justice, that, they, return, to, phenicia, or, that, they, go, wherever, they, want, to, admit, them, when, the, catalan, tribes, saw, spain, and, settled, in, the, spanish, territory, that, is, now, occupied, by, the, provinces, of, barcelona, gerona, l, rida, and, tarragona, how, little, they, imagined, that, the, case, of, the, captivity, of, the, tribes, of, israel, in, egypt, would, be, repeated, there, let, us, respect, his, most, holy, will, they, are, eternally, inadaptable, their, cowardice, and, selfishness, leaves, them, no, room, for, fraternity, so, we, propose, to, the, constituent, cortes, the, expulsion, of, the, catalanists, you, are, free, the, republic, opens, wide, the, doors, of, spain, your, prison, go, away, get, out, of, here, go, back, to, phenicia, or, go, wherever, you, want, how, big, is, the, world, the, main, scapegoat, of, spanish, nationalism, is, the, non, spanish, languages, which, over, the, last, three, hundred, years, have, been, tried, to, be, replaced, by, spanish, with, hundreds, of, laws, and, regulations, but, also, with, acts, of, great, violence, such, as, during, the, civil, war, for, example, the, statements, of, queipo, de, llano, can, be, found, in, the, article, entitled, against, catalonia, the, israel, of, the, modern, world, published, in, the, diario, palentino, on, november, 26, 1936, where, it, is, dropped, that, in, america, catalans, are, considered, a, race, of, jews, because, they, use, the, same, procedures, that, the, hebrews, perform, in, all, the, nations, of, the, globe, and, considering, the, catalans, as, hebrews, and, considering, his, anti, semitism, our, struggle, is, not, a, civil, war, but, a, war, for, western, civilization, against, the, jewish, world, it, is, not, surprising, that, queipo, de, llano, expressed, his, anti, catalan, intentions, when, the, war, is, over, pompeu, fabra, and, his, works, will, be, dragged, along, the, ramblas, it, was, not, talk, to, talk, the, house, of, pompeu, fabra, the, standardizer, of, catalan, language, was, raided, and, his, huge, personal, library, burned, in, the, middle, of, the, street, pompeu, fabra, was, able, to, escape, into, exile, another, example, of, fascist, aggression, towards, the, catalan, language, is, pointed, out, by, paul, preston, in, the, spanish, holocaust, given, that, during, the, civil, war, it, practically, led, to, an, ethnic, conflict, in, the, days, following, the, occupation, of, lleida, the, republican, prisoners, identified, as, catalans, were, executed, without, trial, anyone, who, heard, them, speak, catalan, was, very, likely, to, be, arrested, the, arbitrary, brutality, of, the, anti, catalan, repression, reached, such, a, point, that, franco, himself, had, to, issue, an, order, ordering, that, mistakes, that, could, later, be, regretted, be, avoided, there, are, examples, of, the, murder, of, peasants, for, no, other, apparent, reason, than, that, of, speaking, catalan, after, a, possible, attempt, at, ethnic, cleansing, the, biopolitical, imposition, of, spanish, during, the, franco, dictatorship, to, the, point, of, being, considered, an, attempt, at, cultural, genocide, democracy, consolidated, an, apparent, asymmetric, regime, of, bilingualism, of, sorts, wherein, the, spanish, government, has, employed, a, system, of, laws, that, favored, spanish, over, catalan, which, becomes, the, weaker, of, the, two, languages, and, therefore, in, the, absence, of, other, states, where, it, is, spoken, is, doomed, to, extinction, in, the, medium, or, short, term, in, the, same, vein, its, use, in, the, spanish, congress, is, prevented, and, it, is, prevented, from, achieving, official, status, europe, unlike, less, spoken, languages, such, as, gaelic, in, other, institutional, areas, such, as, justice, plataforma, per, la, llengua, has, denounced, catalanophobia, the, association, soberania, i, just, cia, have, also, denounced, it, in, an, act, in, the, european, parliament, it, also, takes, the, form, of, linguistic, secessionism, originally, advocated, by, the, spanish, extreme, right, and, which, has, finally, been, adopted, by, the, spanish, government, itself, and, state, bodies, in, november, 2005, omnium, cultural, organized, a, meeting, of, catalan, and, madrid, intellectuals, in, the, c, rculo, de, bellas, artes, in, madrid, to, show, support, for, ongoing, reform, of, catalan, statute, of, autonomy, which, sought, to, resolve, territorial, tensions, and, among, other, things, better, protect, the, catalan, language, on, the, catalan, side, a, flight, was, made, with, one, hundred, representatives, of, the, cultural, civic, intellectual, artistic, and, sporting, world, of, catalonia, but, on, the, spanish, side, except, santiago, carrillo, a, politician, from, the, second, republic, did, not, attend, any, more, the, subsequent, failure, of, the, statutory, reform, with, respect, to, its, objectives, opened, the, door, to, the, growth, of, catalan, sovereignty, apart, from, language, discrimination, by, public, officials, e, g, in, the, hospitals, the, prohibition, until, september, 2023, 47, years, after, franco, s, death, of, using, the, catalan, language, in, state, institutions, such, as, court, despite, being, the, former, crown, of, aragon, with, three, catalan, speaking, territories, one, of, the, co, founders, of, the, current, spanish, state, is, nothing, more, than, the, continuation, of, the, foreignization, of, catalan, speaking, people, from, the, first, third, of, the, 20th, century, in, full, swing, of, state, racism, and, fascism, it, also, can, be, pointed, the, linguistic, secessionism, originally, advocated, by, the, spanish, far, right, and, which, has, finally, been, adopted, by, the, spanish, government, itself, and, state, bodies, by, fragmenting, catalan, language, into, as, many, languages, as, territories, it, becomes, inoperative, economically, suffocated, and, becomes, a, political, toy, in, the, hands, of, territorial, politicians, susceptible, to, be, classified, as, an, ethnic, democracy, the, spanish, state, currently, only, recognizes, the, romani, as, a, national, minority, excluding, catalans, and, of, course, valencians, and, balearic, basques, and, galicians, however, it, is, evident, to, any, external, observer, that, there, are, social, diversities, within, the, spanish, state, that, qualify, as, manifestations, of, national, minorities, such, as, for, example, the, existence, of, the, main, three, linguistic, minorities, in, their, ancestral, territories, the, united, kingdom, is, an, unusual, example, of, a, nation, state, due, to, its, countries, within, a, country, the, united, kingdom, is, formed, by, the, union, of, england, scotland, wales, and, northern, ireland, but, it, is, a, unitary, state, formed, initially, by, the, merger, of, two, independent, kingdoms, the, kingdom, of, england, which, already, included, wales, and, the, kingdom, of, scotland, but, the, treaty, of, union, 1707, that, set, out, the, agreed, terms, has, ensured, the, continuation, of, distinct, features, of, each, state, including, separate, legal, systems, and, separate, national, churches, in, 2003, the, british, government, described, the, united, kingdom, as, countries, within, a, country, while, the, office, for, national, statistics, and, others, describe, the, united, kingdom, as, a, nation, state, others, including, a, then, prime, minister, describe, it, as, a, multinational, state, and, the, term, home, nations, is, used, to, describe, the, four, national, teams, that, represent, the, four, nations, of, the, united, kingdom, england, northern, ireland, scotland, wales, some, refer, to, it, as, a, union, state, the, most, obvious, deviation, from, the, ideal, of, one, nation, one, state, is, the, presence, of, minorities, especially, ethnic, minorities, which, are, clearly, not, members, of, the, majority, nation, an, ethnic, nationalist, definition, of, a, nation, is, necessarily, exclusive, ethnic, nations, typically, do, not, have, open, membership, in, most, cases, there, is, a, clear, idea, that, surrounding, nations, are, different, and, that, includes, members, of, those, nations, who, live, on, the, wrong, side, of, the, border, historical, examples, of, groups, who, have, been, specifically, singled, out, as, outsiders, are, the, roma, and, jews, in, europe, negative, responses, to, minorities, within, the, nation, state, have, ranged, from, cultural, assimilation, enforced, by, the, state, to, expulsion, persecution, violence, and, extermination, the, assimilation, policies, are, usually, enforced, by, the, state, but, violence, against, minorities, is, not, always, state, initiated, it, can, occur, in, the, form, of, mob, violence, such, as, lynching, or, pogroms, nation, states, are, responsible, for, some, of, the, worst, historical, examples, of, violence, against, minorities, not, considered, part, of, the, nation, however, many, nation, states, accept, specific, minorities, as, being, part, of, the, nation, and, the, term, national, minority, is, often, used, in, this, sense, the, sorbs, in, germany, are, an, example, for, centuries, they, have, lived, in, german, speaking, states, surrounded, by, a, much, larger, ethnic, german, population, and, they, have, no, other, historical, territory, they, are, now, generally, considered, to, be, part, of, the, german, nation, and, are, accepted, as, such, by, the, federal, republic, of, germany, which, constitutionally, guarantees, their, cultural, rights, of, the, thousands, of, ethnic, and, cultural, minorities, in, nation, states, across, the, world, only, a, few, have, this, level, of, acceptance, and, protection, multiculturalism, is, an, official, policy, in, some, states, establishing, the, ideal, of, coexisting, existence, among, multiple, and, separate, ethnic, cultural, and, linguistic, groups, other, states, prefer, the, interculturalism, or, melting, pot, approach, alternative, to, multiculturalism, citing, problems, with, latter, as, promoting, self, segregation, tendencies, among, minority, groups, challenging, national, cohesion, polarizing, society, in, groups, that, can, t, relate, to, one, another, generating, problems, in, regard, to, minorities, and, immigrants, fluency, in, the, national, language, of, use, and, integration, with, the, rest, of, society, generating, hate, and, persecution, against, them, from, the, otherness, they, would, generate, in, such, a, case, according, to, its, adherents, without, minorities, having, to, give, up, certain, parts, of, their, culture, before, being, absorbed, into, a, now, changed, majority, culture, by, their, contribution, many, nations, have, laws, protecting, minority, rights, when, national, boundaries, that, do, not, match, ethnic, boundaries, are, drawn, such, as, in, the, balkans, and, central, asia, ethnic, tension, massacres, and, even, genocide, sometimes, has, occurred, historically, see, bosnian, genocide, and, 2010, south, kyrgyzstan, ethnic, clashes, in, principle, the, border, of, a, nation, state, would, extend, far, enough, to, include, all, the, members, of, the, nation, and, all, of, the, national, homeland, again, in, practice, some, of, them, always, live, on, the, wrong, side, of, the, border, part, of, the, national, homeland, may, be, there, too, and, it, may, be, governed, by, the, wrong, nation, the, response, to, the, non, inclusion, of, territory, and, population, may, take, the, form, of, irredentism, demands, to, annex, unredeemed, territory, and, incorporate, it, into, the, nation, state, irredentist, claims, are, usually, based, on, the, fact, that, an, identifiable, part, of, the, national, group, lives, across, the, border, however, they, can, include, claims, to, territory, where, no, members, of, that, nation, live, at, present, because, they, lived, there, in, the, past, the, national, language, is, spoken, in, that, region, the, national, culture, has, influenced, it, geographical, unity, with, the, existing, territory, or, a, wide, variety, of, other, reasons, past, grievances, are, usually, involved, and, can, cause, revanchism, it, is, sometimes, difficult, to, distinguish, irredentism, from, pan, nationalism, since, both, claim, that, all, members, of, an, ethnic, and, cultural, nation, belong, in, one, specific, state, pan, nationalism, is, less, likely, to, specify, the, nation, ethnically, for, instance, variants, of, pan, germanism, have, different, ideas, about, what, constituted, greater, germany, including, the, confusing, term, grossdeutschland, which, in, fact, implied, the, inclusion, of, huge, slavic, minorities, from, the, austro, hungarian, empire, typically, irredentist, demands, are, at, first, made, by, members, of, non, state, nationalist, movements, when, they, are, adopted, by, a, state, they, typically, result, in, tensions, and, actual, attempts, at, annexation, are, always, considered, a, casus, belli, a, cause, for, war, in, many, cases, such, claims, result, in, long, term, hostile, relations, between, neighbouring, states, irredentist, movements, typically, circulate, maps, of, the, claimed, national, territory, the, greater, nation, state, that, territory, which, is, often, much, larger, than, the, existing, state, plays, a, central, role, in, their, propaganda, irredentism, should, not, be, confused, with, claims, to, overseas, colonies, which, are, not, generally, considered, part, of, the, national, homeland, some, french, overseas, colonies, would, be, an, exception, french, rule, in, algeria, unsuccessfully, treated, the, colony, as, a, d, partement, of, france, it, has, been, speculated, by, both, proponents, of, globalization, and, various, science, fiction, writers, that, the, concept, of, a, nation, state, may, disappear, with, the, ever, increasing, interconnectedness, of, the, world, such, ideas, are, sometimes, expressed, around, concepts, of, a, world, government, another, possibility, is, a, societal, collapse, and, move, into, communal, anarchy, or, zero, world, government, in, which, nation, states, no, longer, exist, the, theory, of, the, clash, of, civilizations, lies, in, direct, contrast, to, cosmopolitan, theories, about, an, ever, more, connected, world, that, no, longer, requires, nation, states, according, to, political, scientist, samuel, p, huntington, people, s, cultural, and, religious, identities, will, be, the, primary, source, of, conflict, in, the, post, cold, war, world, the, theory, was, originally, formulated, in, a, 1992, lecture, at, the, american, enterprise, institute, which, was, then, developed, in, a, 1993, foreign, affairs, article, titled, the, clash, of, civilizations, in, response, to, francis, fukuyama, s, 1992, book, the, end, of, history, and, the, last, man, huntington, later, expanded, his, thesis, in, a, 1996, book, the, clash, of, civilizations, and, the, remaking, of, world, order, huntington, began, his, thinking, by, surveying, the, diverse, theories, about, the, nature, of, global, politics, in, the, post, cold, war, period, some, theorists, and, writers, argued, that, human, rights, liberal, democracy, and, capitalist, free, market, economics, had, become, the, only, remaining, ideological, alternative, for, nations, in, the, post, cold, war, world, specifically, francis, fukuyama, in, the, end, of, history, and, the, last, man, argued, that, the, world, had, reached, a, hegelian, end, of, history, huntington, believed, that, while, the, age, of, ideology, had, ended, the, world, had, reverted, only, to, a, normal, state, of, affairs, characterized, by, cultural, conflict, in, his, thesis, he, argued, that, the, primary, axis, of, conflict, in, the, future, will, be, along, cultural, and, religious, lines, as, an, extension, he, posits, that, the, concept, of, different, civilizations, as, the, highest, rank, of, cultural, identity, will, become, increasingly, useful, in, analyzing, the, potential, for, conflict, in, the, 1993, foreign, affairs, article, huntington, writes, it, is, my, hypothesis, that, the, fundamental, source, of, conflict, in, this, new, world, will, not, be, primarily, ideological, or, primarily, economic, the, great, divisions, among, humankind, and, the, dominating, source, of, conflict, will, be, cultural, nation, states, will, remain, the, most, powerful, actors, in, world, affairs, but, the, principal, conflicts, of, global, politics, will, occur, between, nations, and, groups, of, different, civilizations, the, clash, of, civilizations, will, dominate, global, politics, the, fault, lines, between, civilizations, will, be, the, battle, lines, of, the, future, sandra, joireman, suggests, that, huntington, may, be, characterised, as, a, neo, primordialist, as, while, he, sees, people, as, having, strong, ties, to, their, ethnicity, he, does, not, believe, that, these, ties, have, always, existed, historians, often, look, to, the, past, to, find, the, origins, of, a, particular, nation, state, indeed, they, often, put, so, much, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, the, nation, state, in, modern, times, that, they, distort, the, history, of, earlier, periods, in, order, to, emphasize, the, question, of, origins, lansing, and, english, argue, that, much, of, the, medieval, history, of, europe, was, structured, to, follow, the, historical, winners, especially, the, nation, states, that, emerged, around, paris, and, london, important, developments, that, did, not, directly, lead, to, a, nation, state, get, neglected, they, argue
