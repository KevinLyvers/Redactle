a, military, exercise, training, exercise, maneuver, manoeuvre, or, war, game, is, the, employment, of, military, resources, in, training, for, military, operations, military, exercises, are, conducted, to, explore, the, effects, of, warfare, or, test, tactics, and, strategies, without, actual, combat, they, also, ensure, the, combat, readiness, of, garrisoned, or, deployable, forces, prior, to, deployment, from, a, home, base, while, both, war, games, and, military, exercises, aim, to, simulate, real, conditions, and, scenarios, for, the, purpose, of, preparing, and, analyzing, those, scenarios, the, distinction, between, a, war, game, and, a, military, exercise, is, determined, primarily, by, the, involvement, of, actual, military, forces, within, the, simulation, or, lack, thereof, military, exercises, focus, on, the, simulation, of, real, full, scale, military, operations, in, controlled, hostile, conditions, in, attempts, to, reproduce, war, time, decisions, and, activities, for, training, purposes, or, to, analyze, the, outcome, of, possible, war, time, decisions, war, games, however, can, be, much, smaller, than, full, scale, military, operations, do, not, typically, include, the, use, of, functional, military, equipment, and, decisions, and, actions, are, carried, out, by, artificial, players, to, simulate, possible, decisions, and, actions, within, an, artificial, scenario, which, usually, represents, a, model, of, a, real, world, scenario, additionally, mathematical, modeling, is, used, in, the, simulation, of, war, games, to, provide, a, quantifiable, method, of, deduction, however, it, is, rare, that, a, war, game, is, depended, upon, for, quantitative, results, and, the, use, of, war, games, is, more, often, found, in, situations, where, qualitative, factors, of, the, simulated, scenario, are, needed, to, be, determined, the, actual, use, of, war, games, and, the, results, that, they, can, provide, are, limited, by, possibilities, war, games, cannot, be, used, to, achieve, predictive, results, as, the, nature, of, war, and, the, scenarios, that, war, games, aim, to, simulate, are, not, deterministic, therefore, war, games, are, primarily, used, to, consider, multiple, possible, outcomes, of, any, given, decision, or, number, of, decisions, made, in, the, simulated, scenario, these, possible, outcomes, are, analyzed, and, compared, and, cause, and, effect, relationships, are, typically, sought, for, the, unknown, factors, within, the, simulation, it, is, typically, the, relationships, between, visual, aspects, of, the, simulation, that, aid, in, the, assessment, of, the, problems, that, are, simulated, within, war, games, like, geographic, locations, and, positionings, that, would, be, difficult, to, discern, or, analyze, at, full, scale, and, for, complex, environments, military, exercises, involving, multiple, branches, of, the, same, military, are, known, as, joint, exercises, while, military, exercises, involving, two, or, more, countries, are, known, as, combined, coalition, bilateral, or, multilateral, exercises, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, relationship, between, the, countries, and, the, number, of, them, involved, these, exercises, allow, for, better, coordination, between, militaries, and, observation, of, enemy, tactics, and, serve, as, a, visible, show, of, strength, and, cooperation, for, the, participating, countries, according, to, a, 2021, study, joint, military, exercises, within, well, defined, alliances, usually, deter, adversaries, without, producing, a, moral, hazard, because, of, the, narrow, scope, of, the, alliance, while, joint, military, exercises, outside, of, an, alliance, which, are, extremely, rare, usually, lead, to, conflict, escalation, exercises, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, have, often, been, identified, by, a, unique, code, name, such, as, cobra, gold, in, the, same, manner, as, military, contingency, operations, and, combat, operations, like, operation, phantom, fury, military, exercises, are, sometimes, used, as, cover, for, the, build, up, to, an, actual, invasion, as, in, the, cases, of, the, warsaw, pact, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, and, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, or, it, can, provoke, opponents, at, peace, to, perceive, it, as, such, as, in, the, case, of, able, archer, 83, a, command, post, exercise, cpx, typically, focuses, on, the, battle, readiness, of, staffs, such, as, a, particular, unified, combatant, command, or, one, of, its, components, at, any, level, it, may, run, in, parallel, with, an, ftx, or, its, equivalent, or, as, a, stand, alone, event, for, headquarters, staff, only, with, heavy, emphasis, on, simulated, events, historical, names, for, the, field, exercise, or, the, full, scale, rehearsal, of, military, maneuvers, as, practice, for, warfare, in, the, military, services, of, the, british, commonwealth, include, schemes, while, those, of, the, military, services, united, states, are, known, as, field, training, exercises, ftx, or, in, the, case, of, naval, forces, fleet, exercises, fleetex, in, a, field, exercise, or, fleet, exercise, the, two, sides, in, the, simulated, battle, are, typically, called, red, simulating, the, enemy, forces, and, blue, to, avoid, naming, a, particular, adversary, this, naming, convention, originates, with, the, inventors, of, the, table, top, war, game, the, kriegsspiel, the, prussian, georg, von, reisswitz, their, army, wore, prussian, blue, so, friendly, forces, were, depicted, by, the, color, blue, several, different, armed, forces, of, the, same, nation, training, together, are, described, as, having, a, joint, exercise, those, involving, forces, of, multiple, nations, are, described, as, having, a, combined, exercise, or, coalition, exercise, these, are, called, a, bilateral, exercise, if, based, on, security, agreements, between, two, nations, or, a, multilateral, exercise, if, the, agreement, is, between, multiple, nations, other, types, of, exercise, include, the, tactical, exercise, without, troops, tewt, also, known, as, a, sand, table, map, cloth, model, or, computer, simulation, exercise, these, allow, commanders, to, manipulate, models, through, possible, scenarios, in, military, planning, this, is, also, called, warfare, simulation, or, in, some, instances, a, virtual, battlefield, and, in, the, past, has, been, described, as, wargames, such, examples, of, modern, military, wargames, include, darwars, a, serious, game, developed, since, 2003, by, darpa, with, bbn, technologies, a, defense, contractor, which, was, involved, in, the, development, of, packet, switching, used, for, arpanet, and, which, developed, the, first, computer, modem, in, 1963, military, operations, and, training, have, included, different, scenarios, a, soldier, might, encounter, with, morals, and, different, ethics, in, one, military, operation, soldiers, are, frequently, asked, to, engage, in, combat, humanitarian, and, stabilization, roles, these, increase, the, ambiguity, of, a, role, one, may, encounter, and, challenge, of, ethics, this, will, also, lead, the, military, personnel, to, have, to, make, a, difficult, call, in, challenging, circumstances, even, in, difficult, situations, and, conditions, military, personnel, still, has, to, follow, rules, and, regulations, such, as, 1, when, the, right, thing, to, do, is, not, immediately, clear, 2, when, two, or, more, important, principles, or, values, support, different, actions, and, 3, when, some, harm, will, result, regardless, of, the, actions, taken, defense, ethics, program, department, of, national, defense, 2012, these, simulations, involve, crude, living, conditions, sleep, deprivations, time, limit, and, either, lack, or, ambiguous, amount, of, information, a, subset, of, simulated, exercises, is, the, table, top, exercise, ttx, typically, limited, to, senior, personnel, stepping, through, the, decision, making, processes, they, would, employ, in, a, crisis, a, contingency, or, general, warfare, the, use, of, military, exercises, and, war, games, can, be, found, to, date, back, to, as, early, as, the, early, 19th, century, wherein, it, was, the, officers, of, the, prussian, army, who, created, the, contemporary, tactical, form, of, wargames, that, have, since, been, more, widely, used, and, developed, by, other, military, conglomerations, throughout, the, world, non, tactical, forms, of, wargames, have, existed, for, much, longer, however, in, the, forms, of, tabletop, games, such, as, chess, and, go, the, modern, use, of, military, exercises, grew, out, of, the, military, need, to, study, warfare, and, to, reenact, old, battles, for, learning, purposes, during, the, age, of, kabinettskriege, cabinet, wars, frederick, the, great, king, of, prussia, from, 1740, to, 1786, put, together, his, armies, as, a, well, oiled, clockwork, mechanism, whose, components, were, robot, like, warriors, no, individual, initiative, was, allowed, to, frederick, s, soldiers, their, only, role, was, to, cooperate, in, the, creation, of, walls, of, projectiles, through, synchronized, firepower, this, was, in, the, pursuit, of, a, more, effective, army, and, such, practices, made, it, easier, to, look, at, war, from, a, top, down, perspective, disciplined, troops, should, respond, predictably, allowing, study, to, be, confined, to, maneuvers, and, command, prussia, s, victory, over, the, second, french, empire, in, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, 71, is, sometimes, partly, credited, to, the, training, of, prussian, officers, with, the, wargame, kriegsspiel, which, was, invented, around, 1811, and, gained, popularity, with, many, officers, in, the, prussian, army, these, first, wargames, were, played, with, dice, which, represented, friction, or, the, intrusion, of, less, than, ideal, circumstances, during, a, real, war, including, morale, meteorology, the, fog, of, war, etc, 21st, century, militaries, still, use, wargames, to, simulate, future, wars, and, model, their, reaction, according, to, manuel, de, landa, after, world, war, ii, the, command, control, and, communications, c, 3, was, transferred, from, the, military, staff, to, the, rand, corporation, the, first, think, tank, around, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, computer, simulated, war, games, were, created, to, replace, traditional, war, gaming, methods, with, the, goal, of, optimizing, and, speeding, up, the, process, and, making, it, possible, to, analyze, more, complex, scenarios, with, greater, ease, in, 1958, the, naval, war, college, installed, a, computer, war, game, system, where, their, traditional, war, gaming, activities, were, held, the, system, was, called, the, navy, electronic, warfare, system, and, cost, over, 10, million, to, install, the, change, from, traditional, war, gaming, methods, to, electronic, computer, simulated, ones, meant, that, the, value, and, accuracy, of, a, war, game, simulation, was, less, dependent, on, skill, and, individual, experiences, and, more, dependent, on, quantitative, data, and, complicated, analysis, methods, von, neumann, was, employed, by, the, rand, corporation, and, his, game, theory, was, used, in, wargames, to, model, nuclear, dissuasion, during, the, cold, war, thus, the, u, s, nuclear, strategy, was, defined, using, wargames, sam, representing, the, u, s, and, ivan, representing, the, soviet, union, early, game, theory, included, only, zero, sum, games, which, means, that, when, one, player, won, the, other, automatically, lost, the, prisoner, s, dilemma, which, models, the, situation, of, two, prisoners, in, which, each, one, is, given, the, choice, to, betray, or, not, the, other, gave, three, alternatives, to, the, game, this, model, gave, the, basis, for, the, massive, retaliation, nuclear, doctrine, the, zero, sum, fallacy, and, cooperative, games, would, be, theorized, only, later, while, the, evolution, of, nuclear, technology, and, missiles, made, the, massive, retaliation, nuclear, strategy, obsolete
