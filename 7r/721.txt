person, who, communicates, a, lie, may, be, termed, a, liar, lies, can, be, interpreted, as, deliberately, false, statements, or, misleading, statements, though, not, all, statements, that, are, literally, false, are, considered, lies, metaphors, hyperboles, and, other, figurative, rhetoric, are, not, intended, to, mislead, while, lies, are, explicitly, meant, for, literal, interpretation, by, their, audience, lies, may, also, serve, a, variety, of, instrumental, interpersonal, or, psychological, functions, for, the, individuals, who, use, them, generally, the, term, lie, carries, a, negative, connotation, and, depending, on, the, context, a, person, who, communicates, a, lie, may, be, subject, to, social, legal, religious, or, criminal, sanctions, for, instance, perjury, or, the, act, of, lying, under, oath, can, result, in, criminal, and, civil, charges, being, pressed, against, the, perjurer, although, people, in, many, cultures, believe, that, deception, can, be, detected, by, observing, nonverbal, behaviors, e, g, not, making, eye, contact, fidgeting, stuttering, smiling, research, indicates, that, people, overestimate, both, the, significance, of, such, cues, and, their, ability, to, make, accurate, judgements, about, deception, more, generally, people, s, ability, to, make, true, judgments, is, affected, by, biases, towards, accepting, incoming, information, and, interpreting, feelings, as, evidence, of, truth, people, do, not, always, check, incoming, assertions, against, their, memory, the, potential, consequences, of, lying, are, manifold, some, in, particular, are, worth, considering, typically, lies, aim, to, deceive, so, the, hearer, may, acquire, a, false, belief, or, at, least, something, that, the, speaker, believes, to, be, false, when, deception, is, unsuccessful, a, lie, may, be, discovered, the, discovery, of, a, lie, may, discredit, other, statements, by, the, same, speaker, thereby, staining, that, speaker, s, reputation, in, some, circumstances, it, may, also, negatively, affect, the, social, or, legal, standing, of, the, speaker, lying, in, a, court, of, law, for, instance, is, a, criminal, offense, perjury, hannah, arendt, spoke, about, extraordinary, cases, in, which, an, entire, society, is, being, lied, to, consistently, she, said, that, the, consequences, of, such, lying, are, not, that, you, believe, the, lies, but, rather, that, nobody, believes, anything, any, longer, this, is, because, lies, by, their, very, nature, have, to, be, changed, and, a, lying, government, has, constantly, to, rewrite, its, own, history, on, the, receiving, end, you, get, not, only, one, lie, a, lie, which, you, could, go, on, for, the, rest, of, your, days, but, you, get, a, great, number, of, lies, depending, on, how, the, political, wind, blows, the, question, of, whether, lies, can, be, detected, reliably, through, nonverbal, has, been, the, subject, of, frequent, study, while, people, in, many, cultures, believe, that, deception, can, be, indicated, by, behaviors, such, as, looking, away, fidgeting, or, stammering, this, is, not, supported, by, research, a, 2019, review, of, research, on, deception, and, its, detection, through, nonverbal, behavior, concludes, that, people, tend, to, overestimate, both, the, reliability, of, nonverbal, behavior, as, an, indicator, of, deception, and, their, ability, to, make, accurate, judgements, about, deception, based, on, nonverbal, behavior, polygraph, lie, detector, machines, measure, the, physiological, stress, a, subject, endures, in, a, number, of, measures, while, giving, statements, or, answering, questions, spikes, in, stress, indicators, are, purported, to, reveal, lying, the, accuracy, of, this, method, is, widely, disputed, in, several, well, known, cases, application, of, the, technique, has, been, shown, to, have, given, incorrect, results, nonetheless, it, remains, in, use, in, many, areas, primarily, as, a, method, for, eliciting, confessions, or, employment, screening, the, unreliability, of, polygraph, results, is, the, basis, of, the, exclusion, of, such, evaluations, as, admissible, evidence, in, many, courts, and, the, technique, is, generally, perceived, to, be, an, example, of, pseudoscience, a, recent, study, found, that, composing, a, lie, takes, longer, than, telling, the, truth, and, thus, the, time, taken, to, answer, a, question, may, be, used, as, a, method, of, lie, detection, instant, answers, with, a, lie, may, be, proof, of, a, prepared, lie, a, recommendation, provided, to, resolve, that, contradiction, is, to, try, to, surprise, the, subject, and, find, a, midway, answer, not, too, quick, nor, too, long, utilitarian, philosophers, have, supported, lies, that, achieve, good, outcomes, white, lies, in, his, 2008, book, how, to, make, good, decisions, and, be, right, all, the, time, iain, king, suggested, a, credible, rule, on, lying, was, possible, and, he, defined, it, as, deceive, only, if, you, can, change, behaviour, in, a, way, worth, more, than, the, trust, you, would, lose, were, the, deception, discovered, whether, the, deception, actually, is, exposed, or, not, stanford, law, professor, deborah, l, rhode, articulated, three, rules, she, says, ethicists, generally, agree, distinguish, white, lies, from, harmful, lies, or, cheating, aristotle, believed, no, general, rule, on, lying, was, possible, because, anyone, who, advocated, lying, could, never, be, believed, he, said, the, philosophers, st, augustine, st, thomas, aquinas, and, immanuel, kant, condemned, all, lying, according, to, all, three, there, are, no, circumstances, in, which, ethically, one, may, lie, even, if, the, only, way, to, protect, oneself, is, to, lie, it, is, never, ethically, permissible, to, lie, even, in, the, face, of, murder, torture, or, any, other, hardship, each, of, these, philosophers, gave, several, arguments, for, the, ethical, basis, against, lying, all, compatible, with, each, other, among, the, more, important, arguments, are, in, lying, neuroscientist, sam, harris, argues, that, lying, is, negative, for, the, liar, and, the, person, who, is, being, lied, to, to, tell, lies, is, to, deny, others, access, to, reality, and, the, harm, of, lying, often, cannot, be, anticipated, the, ones, lied, to, may, fail, to, solve, problems, they, could, have, solved, only, on, a, basis, of, good, information, to, lie, also, harms, oneself, making, the, liar, distrust, the, person, who, is, being, lied, to, liars, generally, feel, badly, about, their, lies, and, sense, a, loss, of, sincerity, authenticity, and, integrity, harris, asserts, that, honesty, allows, one, to, have, deeper, relationships, and, to, bring, all, dysfunction, in, one, s, life, to, the, surface, in, human, all, too, human, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, suggested, that, those, who, refrain, from, lying, may, do, so, only, because, of, the, difficulty, involved, in, maintaining, lies, this, is, consistent, with, his, general, philosophy, that, divides, or, ranks, people, according, to, strength, and, ability, thus, some, people, tell, the, truth, only, out, of, weakness, a, study, was, conducted, by, the, university, of, nottingham, released, in, 2016, which, utilized, a, dice, roll, test, where, participants, could, easily, lie, to, get, a, bigger, payout, the, study, found, that, in, countries, with, high, prevalence, of, rule, breaking, dishonesty, in, people, in, their, early, 20s, was, more, prevalent, possession, of, the, capacity, to, lie, among, non, humans, has, been, asserted, during, language, studies, with, great, apes, in, one, instance, the, gorilla, koko, when, asked, who, tore, a, sink, from, the, wall, pointed, to, one, of, her, handlers, and, then, laughed, deceptive, body, language, such, as, feints, that, mislead, as, to, the, intended, direction, of, attack, or, flight, is, observed, in, many, species, a, mother, bird, deceives, when, she, pretends, to, have, a, broken, wing, to, divert, the, attention, of, a, perceived, predator, including, unwitting, humans, from, the, eggs, in, her, nest, instead, to, her, as, she, draws, the, predator, away, from, the, location, of, the, nest, most, notably, a, trait, of, the, killdeer, it, is, asserted, that, the, capacity, to, lie, is, a, talent, human, beings, possess, universally, the, evolutionary, theory, proposed, by, darwin, states, that, only, the, fittest, will, survive, and, by, lying, we, aim, to, improve, other, s, perception, of, our, social, image, and, status, capability, and, desirability, in, general, studies, have, shown, that, humans, begin, lying, at, a, mere, age, of, six, months, through, crying, and, laughing, to, gain, attention, scientific, studies, have, shown, differences, in, forms, of, lying, across, gender, although, men, and, women, lie, at, equal, frequencies, men, are, more, likely, to, lie, in, order, to, please, themselves, while, women, are, more, likely, to, lie, to, please, others, the, presumption, is, that, humans, are, individuals, living, in, a, world, of, competition, and, strict, social, norms, where, they, are, able, to, use, lies, and, deception, to, enhance, chances, of, survival, and, reproduction, stereotypically, speaking, david, livingstone, smith, asserts, that, men, like, to, exaggerate, about, their, sexual, expertise, but, shy, away, from, topics, that, degrade, them, while, women, understate, their, sexual, expertise, to, make, themselves, more, respectable, and, loyal, in, the, eyes, of, men, and, avoid, being, labelled, as, a, scarlet, woman, those, with, parkinson, s, disease, show, difficulties, in, deceiving, others, difficulties, that, link, to, prefrontal, hypometabolism, this, suggests, a, link, between, the, capacity, for, dishonesty, and, integrity, of, prefrontal, functioning, pseudologia, fantastica, is, a, term, applied, by, psychiatrists, to, the, behavior, of, habitual, or, compulsive, lying, mythomania, is, the, condition, where, there, is, an, excessive, or, abnormal, propensity, for, lying, and, exaggerating, a, recent, study, found, that, composing, a, lie, takes, longer, than, telling, the, truth, or, as, chief, joseph, succinctly, put, it, it, does, not, require, many, words, to, speak, the, truth, some, people, who, are, not, convincing, liars, truly, believe, they, are, the, old, testament, and, new, testament, of, the, bible, both, contain, statements, that, god, cannot, lie, and, that, lying, is, immoral, num, 23, 19, hab, 2, 3, heb, 6, 13, 18, nevertheless, there, are, examples, of, god, deliberately, causing, enemies, to, become, disorientated, and, confused, in, order, to, provide, victory, 2, thess, 2, 11, 1, kings, 22, 23, ezek, 14, 9, various, passages, of, the, bible, feature, exchanges, that, assert, lying, is, immoral, and, wrong, prov, 6, 16, 19, ps, 5, 6, lev, 19, 11, prov, 14, 5, prov, 30, 6, zeph,

a, specific, reference, to, perjury, other, passages, feature, descriptive, not, prescriptive, exchanges, where, lying, was, committed, in, extreme, circumstances, involving, life, and, death, most, christian, philosophers, might, argue, that, lying, is, never, acceptable, but, that, even, those, who, are, righteous, in, god, s, eyes, sin, sometimes, old, testament, accounts, of, lying, include, in, the, new, testament, jesus, refers, to, the, devil, as, the, father, of, lies, john, 8, 44, and, paul, commands, christians, do, not, lie, to, one, another, col, 3, 9, cf, lev, 19, 11, in, the, day, of, judgement, unrepentant, liars, will, be, punished, in, the, lake, of, fire, rev, 21, 8, 21, 27, augustine, of, hippo, wrote, two, books, about, lying, on, lying, de, mendacio, and, against, lying, contra, mendacio, he, describes, each, book, in, his, later, work, retractationes, based, on, the, location, of, de, mendacio, in, retractationes, it, appears, to, have, been, written, about, ad, 395, the, first, work, on, lying, begins, magna, qu, stio, est, de, mendacio, there, is, a, great, question, about, lying, from, his, text, it, can, be, derived, that, st, augustine, divided, lies, into, eight, categories, listed, in, order, of, descending, severity, despite, distinguishing, between, lies, according, to, their, external, severity, augustine, maintains, in, both, treatises, that, all, lies, defined, precisely, as, the, external, communication, of, what, one, does, not, hold, to, be, internally, true, are, categorically, sinful, and, therefore, ethically, impermissible, augustine, wrote, that, lies, told, in, jest, or, by, someone, who, believes, or, opines, the, lie, to, be, true, are, not, in, fact, lies, the, fourth, of, the, five, buddhist, precepts, involves, falsehood, spoken, or, committed, to, by, action, avoiding, other, forms, of, wrong, speech, are, also, considered, part, of, this, precept, consisting, of, malicious, speech, harsh, speech, and, gossip, a, breach, of, the, precept, is, considered, more, serious, if, the, falsehood, is, motivated, by, an, ulterior, motive, rather, than, for, example, a, small, white, lie, the, accompanying, virtue, is, being, honest, and, dependable, and, involves, honesty, in, work, truthfulness, to, others, loyalty, to, superiors, and, gratitude, to, benefactors, in, buddhist, texts, this, precept, is, considered, most, important, next, to, the, first, precept, because, a, lying, person, is, regarded, to, have, no, shame, and, therefore, capable, of, many, wrongs, lying, is, not, only, to, be, avoided, because, it, harms, others, but, also, because, it, goes, against, the, buddhist, ideal, of, finding, the, truth, the, fourth, precept, includes, avoidance, of, lying, and, harmful, speech, some, modern, buddhist, teachers, such, as, thich, nhat, hanh, interpret, this, to, include, avoiding, spreading, false, news, and, uncertain, information, work, that, involves, data, manipulation, false, advertising, or, online, scams, can, also, be, regarded, as, violations, anthropologist, barend, terwiel, reports, that, among, thai, buddhists, the, fourth, precept, also, is, seen, to, be, broken, when, people, insinuate, exaggerate, or, speak, abusively, or, deceitfully, in, gesta, ttr, one, of, the, sections, within, the, eddaic, poem, h, vam, l, odin, states, that, it, is, advisable, when, dealing, with, a, false, foe, who, lies, to, tell, lies, also, zoroaster, teaches, that, there, are, two, powers, in, the, universe, asha, which, is, truth, order, and, that, which, is, real,
