a, cheque, or, check, in, north, american, english, see, spelling, differences, is, a, document, that, orders, a, bank, building, society, or, credit, union, to, pay, a, specific, amount, of, money, from, a, person, s, account, to, the, person, in, whose, name, the, cheque, has, been, issued, the, person, writing, the, cheque, known, as, the, drawer, has, a, transaction, banking, account, often, called, a, current, cheque, chequing, checking, or, share, draft, account, where, the, money, is, held, the, drawer, writes, various, details, including, the, monetary, amount, date, and, a, payee, on, the, cheque, and, signs, it, ordering, their, bank, known, as, the, drawee, to, pay, the, amount, of, money, stated, to, the, payee, although, forms, of, cheques, have, been, in, use, since, ancient, times, and, at, least, since, the, 9th, century, they, became, a, highly, popular, non, cash, method, for, making, payments, during, the, 20th, century, and, usage, of, cheques, peaked, by, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, as, cheque, processing, became, automated, billions, of, cheques, were, issued, annually, these, volumes, peaked, in, or, around, the, early, 1990s, since, then, cheque, usage, has, fallen, being, replaced, by, electronic, payment, systems, such, as, debit, cards, and, credit, cards, in, an, increasing, number, of, countries, cheques, have, either, become, a, marginal, payment, system, or, have, been, completely, phased, out, a, cheque, is, a, negotiable, instrument, instructing, a, financial, institution, to, pay, a, specific, amount, of, a, specific, currency, from, a, specified, transactional, account, held, in, the, drawer, s, name, with, that, institution, both, the, drawer, and, payee, may, be, natural, persons, or, legal, entities, cheques, are, order, instruments, and, are, not, in, general, payable, simply, to, the, bearer, as, bearer, instruments, are, but, must, be, paid, to, the, payee, in, some, countries, such, as, the, us, the, payee, may, endorse, the, cheque, allowing, them, to, specify, a, third, party, to, whom, it, should, be, paid, cheques, are, a, type, of, bill, of, exchange, that, were, developed, as, a, way, to, make, payments, without, the, need, to, carry, large, amounts, of, money, paper, money, evolved, from, promissory, notes, another, form, of, negotiable, instrument, similar, to, cheques, in, that, they, were, originally, a, written, order, to, pay, the, given, amount, to, whoever, had, it, in, their, possession, the, bearer, check, is, the, original, spelling, in, the, english, language, the, newer, spelling, cheque, from, the, french, is, believed, to, have, come, into, use, around, 1828, when, the, switch, was, made, by, james, william, gilbart, in, his, practical, treatise, on, banking, the, spellings, check, checque, and, cheque, were, used, interchangeably, from, the, 17th, century, until, the, 20th, century, however, since, the, 19th, century, in, the, commonwealth, and, ireland, the, spelling, cheque, from, the, french, word, ch, que, has, become, standard, for, the, financial, instrument, while, check, is, used, only, for, other, meanings, thus, distinguishing, the, two, definitions, in, writing, in, american, english, the, usual, spelling, for, both, is, check, etymological, dictionaries, attribute, the, financial, meaning, of, check, to, come, from, a, check, against, forgery, with, the, use, of, check, to, mean, control, stemming, from, the, check, used, in, chess, a, term, which, came, into, english, through, french, latin, arabic, and, ultimately, from, the, persian, word, shah, or, king, the, cheque, had, its, origins, in, the, ancient, banking, system, in, which, bankers, would, issue, orders, at, the, request, of, their, customers, to, pay, money, to, identified, payees, such, an, order, was, referred, to, as, a, bill, of, exchange, the, use, of, bills, of, exchange, facilitated, trade, by, eliminating, the, need, for, merchants, to, carry, large, quantities, of, currency, for, example, gold, to, purchase, goods, and, services, there, is, early, evidence, of, using, bill, of, exchange, in, india, during, the, maurya, empire, from, 321, to, 185, bc, a, commercial, instrument, called, the, adesha, was, in, use, which, was, an, order, on, a, banker, desiring, him, to, pay, the, money, of, the, note, to, a, third, person, the, ancient, romans, are, believed, to, have, used, an, early, form, of, cheque, known, as, praescriptiones, in, the, 1st, century, bc, beginning, in, the, third, century, ad, banks, in, persian, territory, began, to, issue, letters, of, credit, these, letters, were, termed, ak, meaning, document, or, contract, the, ak, became, the, sakk, later, used, by, traders, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, and, other, arab, ruled, lands, transporting, a, paper, sakk, was, more, secure, than, transporting, money, in, the, ninth, century, a, merchant, in, one, country, could, cash, a, sakk, drawn, on, his, bank, in, another, country, the, persian, poet, ferdowsi, used, the, term, cheque, several, times, in, his, famous, book, shahnameh, when, referring, to, the, sasanid, dynasty, ibn, hawqal, living, in, the, 10th, century, records, the, use, of, a, cheque, written, in, aoudaghost, which, was, worth, 42, 000, dinars, in, the, 13th, century, the, bill, of, exchange, was, developed, in, venice, as, a, legal, device, to, allow, international, trade, without, the, need, to, carry, large, amounts, of, gold, and, silver, their, use, subsequently, spread, to, other, european, countries, in, the, early, 1500s, to, protect, large, accumulations, of, cash, people, in, the, dutch, republic, began, depositing, their, money, with, cashiers, these, cashiers, held, the, money, for, a, fee, competition, drove, cashiers, to, offer, additional, services, including, paying, money, to, any, person, bearing, a, written, order, from, a, depositor, to, do, so, they, kept, the, note, as, proof, of, payment, this, concept, went, on, to, spread, to, england, and, elsewhere, by, the, 17th, century, bills, of, exchange, were, being, used, for, domestic, payments, in, england, cheques, a, type, of, bill, of, exchange, then, began, to, evolve, initially, they, were, called, drawn, notes, because, they, enabled, a, customer, to, draw, on, the, funds, that, he, or, she, had, in, the, account, with, a, bank, and, required, immediate, payment, these, were, handwritten, and, one, of, the, earliest, known, still, to, be, in, existence, was, drawn, on, messrs, morris, and, clayton, scriveners, and, bankers, based, in, the, city, of, london, and, dated, 16, february, 1659, in, 1717, the, bank, of, england, pioneered, the, first, use, of, a, pre, printed, form, these, forms, were, printed, on, cheque, paper, to, prevent, fraud, and, customers, had, to, attend, in, person, and, obtain, a, numbered, form, from, the, cashier, once, written, the, cheque, was, brought, back, to, the, bank, for, settlement, the, suppression, of, banknotes, in, eighteenth, century, england, further, promoted, the, use, of, cheques, until, about, 1770, an, informal, exchange, of, cheques, took, place, between, london, banks, clerks, of, each, bank, visited, all, the, other, banks, to, exchange, cheques, while, keeping, a, tally, of, balances, between, them, until, they, settled, with, each, other, daily, cheque, clearing, began, around, 1770, when, the, bank, clerks, met, at, the, five, bells, a, tavern, in, lombard, street, in, the, city, of, london, to, exchange, all, their, cheques, in, one, place, and, settle, the, balances, in, cash, this, was, the, first, bankers, clearing, house, provincial, clearinghouses, were, established, in, major, cities, throughout, the, uk, to, facilitate, the, clearing, of, cheques, on, banks, in, the, same, town, birmingham, bradford, bristol, hull, leeds, leicester, liverpool, manchester, newcastle, nottingham, sheffield, and, southampton, all, had, their, own, clearinghouses, in, america, the, bank, of, new, york, began, issuing, cheques, after, its, establishment, by, alexander, hamilton, in, 1784, the, oldest, surviving, example, of, a, complete, american, chequebook, from, the, 1790s, was, discovered, by, a, family, in, new, jersey, the, documents, are, in, some, ways, similar, to, modern, day, cheques, with, some, data, pre, printed, on, sheets, of, paper, alongside, blank, spaces, for, where, other, information, could, be, hand, written, as, needed, it, is, thought, that, the, commercial, bank, of, scotland, was, the, first, bank, to, personalize, its, customers, cheques, in, 1811, by, printing, the, name, of, the, account, holder, vertically, along, the, left, hand, edge, in, 1830, the, bank, of, england, introduced, books, of, 50, 100, and, 200, forms, and, counterparts, bound, or, stitched, these, cheque, books, became, a, common, format, for, the, distribution, of, cheques, to, bank, customers, in, the, late, 19th, century, several, countries, formalized, laws, regarding, cheques, the, uk, passed, the, bills, of, exchange, act, 1882, and, india, passed, the, negotiable, instruments, act, 1881, which, both, covered, cheques, in, 1931, an, attempt, was, made, to, simplify, the, international, use, of, cheques, by, the, geneva, convention, on, the, unification, of, the, law, relating, to, cheques, many, european, and, south, american, states, as, well, as, japan, joined, the, convention, however, countries, including, the, us, and, members, of, the, british, commonwealth, did, not, participate, and, so, it, remained, very, difficult, for, cheques, to, be, used, across, country, borders, in, 1959, a, standard, for, machine, readable, characters, micr, was, agreed, upon, and, patented, in, the, us, for, use, with, cheques, this, opened, the, way, for, the, first, automated, reader, sorting, machines, for, clearing, cheques, as, automation, increased, the, following, years, saw, a, dramatic, change, in, the, way, in, which, cheques, were, handled, and, processed, cheque, volumes, continued, to, grow, in, the, late, 20th, century, cheques, were, the, most, popular, non, cash, method, for, making, payments, with, billions, of, them, processed, each, year, most, countries, saw, cheque, volumes, peak, in, the, late, 1980s, or, early, 1990s, after, which, electronic, payment, methods, became, more, popular, and, the, use, of, cheques, declined, in, 1969, cheque, guarantee, cards, were, introduced, in, several, countries, allowing, a, retailer, to, confirm, that, a, cheque, would, be, honored, when, used, at, a, point, of, sale, the, drawer, would, sign, the, cheque, in, front, of, the, retailer, who, would, compare, the, signature, to, the, signature, on, the, card, and, then, write, the, cheque, guarantee, card, number, on, the, back, of, the, cheque, such, cards, were, generally, phased, out, and, replaced, by, debit, cards, starting, in, the, mid, 1990s, from, the, mid, 1990s, many, countries, enacted, laws, to, allow, for, cheque, truncation, in, which, a, physical, cheque, is, converted, into, electronic, form, for, transmission, to, the, paying, bank, or, clearing, house, this, eliminates, the, cumbersome, physical, presentation, and, saves, time, and, processing, costs, in, 2002, the, eurocheque, system, was, phased, out, and, replaced, with, domestic, clearing, systems, old, eurocheques, could, still, be, used, but, they, were, now, processed, by, national, clearing, systems, at, that, time, several, countries, took, the, opportunity, to, phase, out, the, use, of, cheques, altogether, as, of, 2010, many, countries, have, either, phased, out, the, use, of, cheques, altogether, or, signaled, that, they, would, do, so, in, the, future, the, four, main, items, on, a, cheque, are, as, cheque, usage, increased, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, additional, items, were, added, to, increase, security, or, to, make, processing, easier, for, the, financial, institution, a, signature, of, the, drawer, was, required, to, authorize, the, cheque, and, this, is, the, main, way, to, authenticate, the, cheque, second, it, became, customary, to, write, the, amount, in, words, as, well, as, in, numbers, to, avoid, mistakes, and, make, it, harder, to, fraudulently, alter, the, amount, after, the, cheque, had, been, written, it, is, not, a, legal, requirement, to, write, the, amount, in, words, although, some, banks, will, refuse, to, accept, cheques, that, do, not, have, the, amount, in, both, numbers, and, words, an, issue, date, was, added, and, cheques, may, become, invalid, a, certain, amount, of, time, after, issue, in, the, us, and, canada, a, cheque, is, typically, valid, for, six, months, after, the, date, of, issue, after, which, it, is, a, stale, dated, cheque, but, this, depends, on, where, the, cheque, is, drawn, in, australia, a, cheque, is, typically, valid, for, fifteen, months, of, the, cheque, date, a, cheque, that, has, an, issue, date, in, the, future, a, post, dated, cheque, may, not, be, able, to, be, presented, until, that, date, has, passed, in, some, countries, writing, a, post, dated, cheque, may, simply, be, ignored, or, is, illegal, conversely, an, antedated, cheque, has, an, issue, date, in, the, past, a, cheque, number, was, added, and, cheque, books, were, issued, so, that, cheque, numbers, were, sequential, this, allowed, for, some, basic, fraud, detection, by, banks, and, made, sure, one, cheque, was, not, presented, twice, in, some, countries, such, as, the, us, cheques, may, contain, a, memo, line, where, the, purpose, of, the, cheque, can, be, indicated, as, a, convenience, without, affecting, the, official, parts, of, the, cheque, in, the, united, kingdom, a, memo, line, is, not, available, and, such, notes, may, be, written, on, the, reverse, side, of, the, cheque, in, the, us, at, the, top, when, cheque, oriented, vertically, of, the, reverse, side, of, the, cheque, there, are, usually, one, or, more, blank, lines, labelled, something, like, endorse, here, starting, in, the, 1960s, machine, readable, routing, and, account, information, was, added, to, the, bottom, of, cheques, in, micr, format, which, allowed, automated, sorting, and, routing, of, cheques, between, banks, and, led, to, automated, central, clearing, facilities, the, information, provided, at, the, bottom, of, the, cheque, is, country, specific, and, standards, are, set, by, each, country, s, cheque, clearing, system, this, means, that, the, payee, no, longer, has, to, go, to, the, bank, that, issued, the, cheque, they, can, instead, deposit, it, at, their, own, bank, or, any, other, bank, and, the, cheque, would, be, routed, back, to, the, originating, bank, and, funds, transferred, to, their, own, bank, account, in, the, us, the, bottom, 5, 8, inch, 16, mm, of, the, cheque, is, reserved, for, micr, characters, only, intrusion, into, the, micr, area, can, cause, problems, when, the, cheque, runs, through, the, clearinghouse, requiring, someone, to, print, an, micr, cheque, correction, strip, and, glue, it, to, the, cheque, many, new, atms, do, not, use, deposit, envelopes, and, actually, scan, the, cheque, at, the, time, it, is, deposited, and, will, reject, cheques, due, to, handwriting, incursion, which, interferes, with, reading, the, micr, this, can, cause, considerable, inconvenience, as, the, depositor, may, have, to, wait, days, for, the, bank, to, be, open, and, may, have, difficulty, getting, to, the, bank, even, when, they, are, open, this, can, delay, the, availability, of, the, portion, of, a, deposit, which, their, bank, makes, available, immediately, as, well, as, the, balance, of, the, deposit, terms, of, service, for, many, mobile, cell, phone, camera, deposits, also, require, the, micr, section, to, be, readable, not, all, of, the, micr, characters, have, been, printed, at, the, time, the, cheque, is, written, as, additional, characters, will, be, printed, later, to, encode, the, amount, thus, a, sloppy, signature, could, obscure, characters, that, will, later, be, printed, there, since, micr, characters, are, no, longer, necessarily, printed, in, magnetic, ink, and, will, be, scanned, by, optical, rather, than, magnetic, means, the, readers, will, be, unable, to, distinguish, pen, ink, from, pre, printed, magnetic, ink, these, changes, allow, cheques, to, be, printed, on, ordinary, home, and, office, printers, without, requiring, pre, printed, cheque, forms, allow, atm, deposit, capture, allow, mobile, deposits, and, facilitate, electronic, copies, of, cheques, for, additional, protection, a, cheque, can, be, crossed, which, restricts, the, use, of, the, cheque, so, that, the, funds, must, be, paid, into, a, bank, account, the, format, and, wording, varies, from, country, to, country, but, generally, two, parallel, lines, may, be, placed, either, vertically, across, the, cheque, or, in, the, top, left, hand, corner, in, addition, the, words, or, bearer, must, not, be, used, or, if, pre, printed, on, the, cheque, must, be, crossed, out, on, the, payee, line, if, the, cheque, is, crossed, with, the, words, account, payee, or, similar, then, the, cheque, can, only, be, paid, into, the, bank, account, of, the, person, initially, named, as, the, payee, thus, it, cannot, be, endorsed, to, a, different, payee, cheques, sometimes, include, additional, documents, a, page, in, a, chequebook, may, consist, of, both, the, cheque, itself, and, a, stub, or, counterfoil, when, the, cheque, is, written, only, the, cheque, itself, is, detached, and, the, stub, is, retained, in, the, chequebook, as, a, record, of, the, cheque, alternatively, cheques, may, be, recorded, with, carbon, paper, behind, each, cheque, in, ledger, sheets, between, cheques, or, at, the, back, of, a, chequebook, or, in, a, completely, separate, transaction, register, that, comes, with, a, chequebook, when, a, cheque, is, mailed, a, separate, letter, or, remittance, advice, may, be, attached, to, inform, the, recipient, of, the, purpose, of, the, cheque, formally, which, account, receivable, to, credit, the, funds, to, this, is, frequently, done, formally, using, a, provided, slip, when, paying, a, bill, or, informally, via, a, letter, when, sending, an, ad, hoc, cheque, parties, to, regular, cheques, generally, include, a, drawer, the, depositor, writing, a, cheque, a, drawee, the, financial, institution, where, the, cheque, can, be, presented, for, payment, and, a, payee, the, entity, to, whom, the, drawer, issues, the, cheque, the, drawer, drafts, or, draws, a, cheque, which, is, also, called, cutting, a, cheque, especially, in, the, us, there, may, also, be, a, beneficiary, for, example, in, depositing, a, cheque, with, a, custodian, of, a, brokerage, account, the, payee, will, be, the, custodian, but, the, cheque, may, be, marked, f, b, o, for, the, benefit, of, the, beneficiary, ultimately, there, is, also, at, least, one, endorsee, which, would, typically, be, the, financial, institution, servicing, the, payee, s, account, or, in, some, circumstances, may, be, a, third, party, to, whom, the, payee, owes, or, wishes, to, give, money, a, payee, that, accepts, a, cheque, will, typically, deposit, it, in, an, account, at, the, payee, s, bank, and, have, the, bank, process, the, cheque, in, some, cases, the, payee, will, take, the, cheque, to, a, branch, of, the, drawee, bank, and, cash, the, cheque, there, if, a, cheque, is, refused, at, the, drawee, bank, or, the, drawee, bank, returns, the, cheque, to, the, bank, that, it, was, deposited, at, because, there, are, insufficient, funds, for, the, cheque, to, clear, it, is, said, that, the, cheque, has, been, dishonoured, once, a, cheque, is, approved, and, all, appropriate, accounts, involved, have, been, credited, the, cheque, is, stamped, with, some, kind, of, cancellation, mark, such, as, a, paid, stamp, the, cheque, is, now, a, cancelled, cheque, cancelled, cheques, are, placed, in, the, account, holder, s, file, the, account, holder, can, request, a, copy, of, a, cancelled, cheque, as, proof, of, a, payment, this, is, known, as, the, cheque, clearing, cycle, cheques, can, be, lost, or, go, astray, within, the, cycle, or, be, delayed, if, further, verification, is, needed, in, the, case, of, suspected, fraud, a, cheque, may, thus, bounce, some, time, after, it, has, been, deposited, following, concerns, about, the, amount, of, time, it, took, the, cheque, and, credit, clearing, company, to, clear, cheques, the, united, kingdom, office, of, fair, trading, set, up, a, working, group, in, 2006, to, look, at, the, cheque, clearing, cycle, their, report, said, that, clearing, times, could, be, improved, but, that, the, costs, associated, with, speeding, up, the, cheque, clearing, cycle, could, not, be, justified, considering, the, use, of, cheques, was, declining, however, they, concluded, the, biggest, problem, was, the, unlimited, time, a, bank, could, take, to, dishonour, a, cheque, to, address, this, changes, were, implemented, so, that, the, maximum, time, after, a, cheque, was, deposited, that, it, could, be, dishonoured, was, six, days, what, was, known, as, the, certainty, of, fate, principle, an, advantage, to, the, drawer, of, using, cheques, instead, of, debit, card, transactions, is, that, they, know, the, drawer, s, bank, will, not, release, the, money, until, several, days, later, paying, with, a, cheque, without, adequate, funds, backing, it, and, later, making, a, deposit, to, the, account, on, which, the, cheque, is, drawn, in, order, to, cover, the, cheque, amount, is, called, kiting, or, floating, and, is, generally, illegal, in, the, us, but, applicable, laws, are, rarely, enforced, unless, the, drawer, uses, multiple, chequing, accounts, with, multiple, institutions, to, increase, the, delay, or, to, steal, funds, cheque, usage, has, been, declining, since, the, 1990s, both, for, point, of, sale, transactions, for, which, credit, cards, debit, cards, or, mobile, payment, apps, are, increasingly, preferred, and, for, third, party, payments, for, example, bill, payments, where, the, emergence, of, telephone, banking, has, accelerated, the, decline, online, banking, and, mobile, banking, being, paper, based, cheques, are, costly, for, banks, to, process, in, comparison, to, electronic, payments, so, banks, in, many, countries, now, discourage, the, use, of, cheques, either, by, charging, for, cheques, or, by, making, the, alternatives, more, attractive, to, customers, in, particular, the, handling, of, money, transfers, requires, more, effort, and, is, time, consuming, the, cheque, has, to, be, handed, over, in, person, or, sent, through, mail, the, rise, of, automated, teller, machines, atms, means, that, small, amounts, of, cash, are, often, easily, accessible, so, that, it, is, sometimes, unnecessary, to, write, a, cheque, for, such, amounts, instead, a, number, of, countries, have, announced, or, have, already, completed, the, end, of, cheques, as, a, means, of, payment, in, october, 2023, the, average, american, wrote, just, over, one, check, according, to, the, federal, reserve, bank, of, atlanta, the, average, value, of, these, checks, was, 504, suggesting, that, most, checks, were, used, for, larger, purchases, this, marks, a, significant, decline, from, the, year, 2000, when, americans, wrote, an, average, of, 60, checks, annually, in, many, asian, countries, cheques, were, never, widely, used, and, generally, only, used, by, the, wealthy, with, cash, being, used, for, the, majority, of, payments, except, for, india, where, cheque, usage, was, prevalent, where, cheques, were, used, they, have, been, declining, rapidly, by, 2009, there, was, negligible, consumer, cheque, usage, in, japan, south, korea, and, taiwan, this, declining, trend, was, accelerated, by, these, developed, markets, advanced, financial, services, infrastructure, many, of, the, developing, countries, in, asia, have, seen, an, increasing, use, of, electronic, payment, systems, leap, frogging, the, less, efficient, chequing, system, altogether, in, most, european, countries, cheques, are, now, rarely, used, or, have, been, completely, phased, out, even, for, third, party, payments, except, for, the, united, kingdom, france, and, ireland, in, most, western, european, countries, it, was, standard, practice, for, businesses, to, publish, their, bank, details, on, invoices, to, facilitate, the, receipt, of, payments, by, giro, even, before, the, introduction, of, online, banking, it, has, been, possible, in, some, countries, to, make, payments, to, third, parties, using, atms, which, may, accurately, and, rapidly, capture, invoice, amounts, due, dates, and, payee, bank, details, via, a, bar, code, reader, to, reduce, keying, in, using, a, cheque, the, onus, is, on, the, payee, to, initiate, the, payment, whereas, with, a, giro, transfer, the, onus, is, on, the, payer, to, effect, the, payment, in, the, united, kingdom, france, and, ireland, cheques, continued, to, be, used, as, cheque, payments, were, free, for, the, consumer, however, these, countries, have, also, seen,

number, of, payments, with, under, 100, million, the, united, states, relied, heavily, on, cheques, due, to, the, convenience, it, affords, payers, and, due, to, the, absence, of, a, high, volume, system, for, low, value, electronic, payments, in, the, us, an, estimated, 18, 3, billion, cheques, were, paid, in, 2012, with, a, value, of, 25, 9, trillion, however, even, in, the, united, states,

to, decline, in, 1994, the, value, of, daily, cheque, transactions, was, a, 25, billion, by, 2004, this, had, dropped, to, only, a, 5, billion, almost, all, of, this, for, b2b, transactions, personal, cheque, use, is, practically, non, existent, thanks, to, the, longstanding, use, of, the, eftpos, system, bpay, electronic, transfers, and, debit, cards, the, australian, payment, systems, strategic, plan, has, said, it, will, remove, cheques, by, 2030, in, new, zealand, payments, by, cheque, have, declined, since, the, mid, 1990s, in, favour, of, electronic, payment, methods, and, were, phased,

most, of, the, commonwealth, the, mechanism, differs, slightly, from, country, to, country, but, in, general, the, bank, issuing, the, cheque, or, draft, will, allocate, the, funds, at, the, point, the, cheque, is, drawn, this, provides, a, guarantee, save, for, a, failure, of, the, bank, that, it, will, be, honoured, cashier, s, cheques, are, perceived, to, be, as, good, as, cash, but, they, are, still, a, cheque, a, misconception, sometimes, exploited, by, scam, artists, a, lost, or, stolen, cheque, can, still, be, stopped, like, any, other, cheque, so, payment, is, not, completely, guaranteed, when, a, certified, cheque, is, drawn, the, bank, operating, the, account, verifies, there, are, currently, sufficient, funds, in, the, drawer, s, account, to, honour, the, cheque, those, funds, are, then, set, aside, in, the, bank, s, internal, account, until, the, cheque, is, cashed, or, returned, by, the, payee, thus, a, certified, cheque, cannot, bounce, and, its, liquidity, is, similar, to, cash, absent, failure, of, the, bank, the, bank, indicates, this, fact, by, making, a, notation, on, the, face, of, the, cheque, technically, called, an, acceptance, a, cheque, used, to, pay, wages, may, be, referred, to, as, a, payroll, cheque, even, when, the, use, of, cheques, for, paying, wages, and, salaries, became, rare, the, vocabulary, pay, cheque, still, remained, commonly, used, to, describe, the, payment, of, wages, and, salaries, payroll, cheques, issued, by, the, military, to, soldiers, or, by, some, other, government, entities, to, their, employees, beneficiants, and, creditors, are, referred, to, as, warrants, warrants, look, like, cheques, and, clear, through, the, banking, system, like, cheques, but, are, not, drawn, against, cleared, funds, in, a, deposit, account, a, cheque, differs, from, a, warrant, in, that, the, warrant, is, not, necessarily, payable, on, demand, and, may, not, be, negotiable, they, are, often, issued, by, government, entities, such, as, the, military, to, pay, wages, or, suppliers, in, this, case, they, are, an, instruction, to, the, entity, s, treasurer, department, to, pay, the, warrant, holder, on, demand, or, after, a,

accept, traveller, s, cheques, as, currency, the, use, of, credit, or, debit, cards, has, begun, to, replace, the, traveller, s, cheque, as, the, standard, for, vacation, money, due, to, their,

as, a, grocery, store, for, payment, in, favour, of, a, third, party, is, referred, to, as, a, money, order, or, postal, order, these, are, paid, for, in, advance, when, the, order, is, drawn, and, are, guaranteed, by, the, institution, that, issues, them, and, can, only, be, paid, to, the, named, third, party, this, was, a, common, way, to, send, low, value, payments, to, third, parties,

ft, 82, ft, until, recently, regardless, of, the, size, such, cheques, could, still, be, redeemed, for, their, cash, value, as, long, as, they, would, have, the, same, parts, as, a, normal, cheque, although, usually, the, oversized, cheque, is, kept, as, a, souvenir, and, a, normal, cheque, is, provided, any, bank, could, levy, additional, charges, for, clearing, an, oversized, cheque, most,
