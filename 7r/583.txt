as, country, native, american, music, new, mexico, music, and, rancheras, westerns, often, stress, the, harshness, of, the, wilderness, and, frequently, set, the, action, in, an, arid, desolate, landscape, of, deserts, and, mountains, often, the, vast, landscape, plays, an, important, role, presenting, a, mythic, vision, of, the, plains, and, deserts, of, the, american, west, specific,

then, showing, the, pursuit, of, the, wrongdoer, ending, in, revenge, and, retribution, which, is, often, dispensed, through, a, shootout, or, quick, draw, duel, the, western, genre, sometimes,

is, a, stereotypical, scene, in, the, popular, conception, of, westerns, in, some, ways, such, protagonists, may, be, considered, the, literary, descendants, of, the, knights, errant, who, stood, at, the, center, of, earlier, extensive, genres, such, as, the, arthurian, romances, like, the, cowboy, or, gunfighter, of, the, western, the, knight, errant, of, the, earlier, european, tales, and, poetry, was, wandering, from, place, to, place, on, his, horse, fighting, villains, of, various, kinds, and, bound, to, no, fixed, social, structures, but, only, to, his, own, innate, code, of, honor, like, knights, errant, the, heroes, of, westerns, frequently, rescue, damsels, in, distress, similarly, the, wandering, protagonists, of, westerns, share, many, characteristics, with, the, ronin, in, modern, japanese, culture, the, western, typically, takes, these, elements, and, uses, them, to, tell, simple, morality, tales, although, some, notable, examples, e, g, the, later, westerns, of, john, ford, or, clint, eastwood, s, unforgiven, about, an, old, contract, killer, are, more, morally, ambiguous, westerns, often, stress, the, harshness, and, isolation, of, the, wilderness, and, frequently, set, the, action, in, an, arid, desolate, landscape, western, films, generally, have, specific, settings, such, as, isolated, ranches, native, american, villages, or, small, frontier, towns, with, a, saloon, oftentimes, these, settings, appear, deserted, and, without, much, structure, apart, from, the, wilderness, the, saloon, usually, emphasizes, that, this, is, the, wild, west, it, is, the, place, to, go, for, music, raucous, piano, playing, women, often, prostitutes, gambling, draw, poker, or, five, card, stud, drinking, beer, whiskey, or, tequila, if, set, in, mexico, brawling, and, shooting, in, some, westerns, where, civilization, has, arrived, the, town, has, a, church, a, general, store, a, bank, and, a, school, in, others, where, frontier, rules, still, hold,
