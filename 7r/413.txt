portuguese, words, can, still, be, traced, to, the, pre, roman, inhabitants, of, portugal, which, included, the, gallaeci, lusitanians, celtici, and, cynetes, most, of, these, words, derived, from, the, hispano, celtic, gallaecian, language, of, northwestern, iberia, and, are, very, often, shared, with, galician, since, both, languages, have, the, same, origin, in, the, medieval, language, of,

initial, arabic, article, a, l, and, include, common, words, such, as, aldeia, village, from, a, ay, a, alface, lettuce, from, al, khassa, armaz, m, warehouse, from, al, makhzan, and, azeite, olive, oil, from, az, zayt, starting, in, the, 15th, century, the, portuguese, maritime, explorations, led, to, the, introduction, of, many, loanwords, from, asian, languages, for, instance, catana, cutlass, from, japanese, katana, ch, tea, from, chinese, ch, and, canja, chicken, soup, piece, of, cake, from, malay, from, the, 16th, to, the, 19th, centuries, because, of, the, role, of, portugal, as, intermediary, in, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, the, establishment, of, large, portuguese, colonies, in, angola, mozambique, and, brazil, portuguese, acquired, several, words, of, african, and, amerind, origin, especially, names, for, most, of, the, animals, and, plants, found, in, those, territories, while, those, terms, are, mostly, used, in, the, former, colonies, many, became, current, in, european, portuguese, as, well, from, kimbundu, for, example, came, kifumate, cafun, head, caress, brazil, kusula, ca, ula, youngest, child, brazil, marimbondo, tropical, wasp, brazil, and, kubungula, bungular, to, dance, like, a, wizard, angola, from, south, america, came, batata, potato, from, taino, anan, s, and, abacaxi, from, tupi, guarani, nan, and, tupi, ib, cati, respectively, two, species, of, pineapple, and, pipoca, popcorn, from, tupi, and, tucano, toucan, from, guarani, tucan, finally, it, has, received, a, steady, influx, of, loanwords, from, other, european, languages, especially, french, and, english, these, are, by, far, the, most, important, languages, when, referring, to, loanwords, there, are, many, examples, such, as, colchete, croch, bracket, crochet, palet, jacket, batom, lipstick, and, fil, filete, steak, slice, rua, street, respectively, from, french, crochet, paletot, b, ton, filet, rue, and, bife, steak, futebol, rev, lver, stock,

dehydrated, or, canned, ham, in, brazil, in, contrast, with, non, canned, wet, cured, presunto, cozido, and, dry, cured, presunto, cru, or, castelhano, castilian, from, spanish, melena, mane, fiambre, and, castellano, portuguese, belongs, to, the, west, iberian, branch, of, the, romance, languages, and, it, has, special, ties, with, the, following, members, of, this, group, portuguese, and, other, romance, languages, namely, french, and, italian, share, considerable, similarities, in, both, vocabulary, and, grammar, portuguese, speakers, will, usually, need, some, formal, study, before, attaining, strong, comprehension, in, those, romance, languages, and, vice, versa, however, portuguese, and, galician, are, fully, mutually, intelligible, and, spanish, is, considerably, intelligible, for, lusophones, owing, to, their, genealogical, proximity, and, shared, genealogical, history, as, west, iberian, ibero, romance, languages, historical, contact, between, speakers, and, mutual, influence, shared, areal, features, as, well, as, modern, lexical, structural, and, grammatical, similarity, 89, between, them, portu, ol, portunhol, a, form, of, code, switching, has, a, more, lively, use, and, is, more, readily, mentioned, in, popular, culture, in, south, america, said, code, switching, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, portu, ol, spoken, on, the, borders, of, brazil, with, uruguay, dialeto, do, pampa, and, paraguay, dialeto, dos, brasiguaios, and, of, portugal, with, spain, barranquenho, that, are, portuguese, dialects, spoken, natively, by, thousands, of, people, which, have, been, heavily, influenced, by, spanish, portuguese, and, spanish, are, the, only, ibero, romance, languages, and, perhaps, the, only, romance, languages, with, such, thriving, inter, language, forms, in, which, visible, and, lively, bilingual, contact, dialects, and, code, switching, have, formed, in, which, functional, bilingual, communication, is, achieved, through, attempting, an, approximation, to, the, target, foreign, language, known, as, portu, ol, without, a, learned, acquisition, process, but, nevertheless, facilitates, communication, there, is, an, emerging, literature, focused, on, such, phenomena, including, informal, attempts, of, standardization, of, the, linguistic, continua, and, their, usage, the, closest, relative, of, portuguese, is, galician, which, is, spoken, in, the, autonomous, community, and, nationality, of, galicia, spanish, kingdom, the, two, were, at, one, time, a, single, language, known, today, as, galician, portuguese, but, they, have, diverged, especially, in, pronunciation, and, vocabulary, due, to, the, political, separation, of, portugal, from, galicia, there, is, however, still, a, linguistic, continuity, consisting, of, the, variant, of, galician, referred, to, as, galego, portugu, s, baixo, limiao, which, is, spoken, in, several, galician, and, portuguese, villages, within, the, transboundary, biosphere, reserve, of, ger, s, xur, s, it, is, considered, a, rarity, a, living, vestige, of, the, medieval, language, that, ranged, from, cantabria, to, mondego, as, reported, by, unesco, due, to, the, pressure, of, spanish, on, the, standard, official, version, of, galician, and, centuries, old, hispanization, the, galician, language, was, on, the, verge, of, disappearing, according, to, the, unesco, philologist, tapani, salminen, the, proximity, to, portuguese, protects, galician, the, core, vocabulary, and, grammar, of, galician, are, noticeably, closer, to, portuguese, than, to, those, of, spanish, and, within, the, eu, context, galician, is, often, considered, the, same, language, as, portuguese, galician, like, portuguese, uses, the, future, subjunctive, the, personal, infinitive, and, the, synthetic, pluperfect, mutual, intelligibility, estimated, at, 85, is, excellent, between, galicians, and, portuguese, despite, political, efforts, in, spain, to, define, them, as, separate, languages, many, linguists, consider, galician, to, be, a, co, dialect, of, the, portuguese, language, with, regional, variations, another, member, of, the, galician, portuguese, group, most, commonly, thought, of, as, a, galician, dialect, is, spoken, in, the, eonavian, region, in, a, western, strip, in, asturias, and, the, westernmost, parts, of, the, provinces, of, le, n, and, zamora, along, the, frontier, with, galicia, between, the, eo, and, navia, rivers, or, more, exactly, eo, and, frexulfe, rivers, it, is, called, eonaviego, or, gallego, asturiano, by, its, speakers, the, fala, language, known, by, its, speakers, as, xalim, s, ma, egu, a, fala, de, x, lima, and, chapurr, u, and, in, portuguese, as, a, fala, de, x, lima, a, fala, da, estremadura, o, galego, da, estremadura, valego, or, galaico, estremenho, is, another, descendant, of, galician, portuguese, spoken, by, a, small, number, of, people, in, the, spanish, towns, of, valverde, del, fresno, valverdi, du, fresnu, eljas, as, ellas, and, san, mart, n, de, trevejo, sa, mart, n, de, trevellu, in, the, autonomous, community, of, extremadura, near, the, border, with, portugal, there, are, a, number, of, other, places, in, spain, in, which, the, native, language, of, the, common, people, is, a, descendant, of, the, galician, portuguese, group, such, as, la, alamedilla, cedillo, cedilho, herrera, de, alc, ntara, ferreira, d, alc, ntara, and, olivenza, oliven, a, but, in, these, municipalities, what, is, spoken, is, actually, portuguese, not, disputed, as, such, in, the, mainstream, the, diversity, of, dialects, of, the, portuguese, language, is, known, since, the, time, of, medieval, portuguese, galician, language, when, it, coexisted, with, the, lusitanian, mozarabic, dialect, spoken, in, the, south, of, portugal, the, dialectal, diversity, becomes, more, evident, in, the, work, of, fern, o, d, oliveira, in, the, grammatica, da, lingoagem, portuguesa, 1536, where, he, remarks, that, the, people, of, portuguese, regions, of, beira, alentejo, estremadura, and, entre, douro, e, minho, all, speak, differently, from, each, other, also, contador, d, argote, 1725, distinguishes, three, main, varieties, of, dialects, the, local, dialects, the, dialects, of, time, and, of, profession, work, jargon, of, local, dialects, he, highlights, five, main, dialects, the, dialect, of, estremadura, of, entre, douro, e, minho, of, beira, of, algarve, and, of, tr, s, os, montes, he, also, makes, reference, to, the, overseas, dialects, the, rustic, dialects, the, poetic, dialect, and, that, of, prose, in, the, kingdom, of, portugal, ladinho, or, lingoagem, ladinha, was, the, name, given, to, the, pure, portuguese, romance, language, without, any, mixture, of, aravia, or, gerigon, a, judenga, while, the, term, l, ngua, vulgar, was, used, to, name, the, language, before, d, dinis, decided, to, call, it, portuguese, language, the, erudite, version, used, and, known, as, galician, portuguese, the, language, of, the, portuguese, court, and, all, other, portuguese, dialects, were, spoken, at, the, same, time, in, a, historical, perspective, the, portuguese, language, was, never, just, one, dialect, just, like, today, there, is, a, standard, portuguese, actually, two, among, the, several, dialects, of, portuguese, in, the, past, there, was, galician, portuguese, as, the, standard, coexisting, with, other, dialects, portuguese, has, provided, loanwords, to, many, languages, such, as, indonesian, manado, malay, malayalam, sri, lankan, tamil, and, sinhala, malay, bengali, english, hindi, swahili, afrikaans, konkani, marathi, punjabi, tetum, xitsonga, japanese, lanc, patu, esan, bandari, spoken, in, iran, and, sranan, tongo, spoken, in, suriname, it, left, a, strong, influence, on, the, l, ngua, bras, lica, a, tupi, guarani, language, which, was, the, most, widely, spoken, in, brazil, until, the, 18th, century, and, on, the, language, spoken, around, sikka, in, flores, island, indonesia, in, nearby, larantuka, portuguese, is, used, for, prayers, in, holy, week, rituals, the, japanese, portuguese, dictionary, nippo, jisho, 1603, was, the, first, dictionary, of, japanese, in, a, european, language, a, product, of, jesuit, missionary, activity, in, japan, building, on, the, work, of, earlier, portuguese, missionaries, the, dictionarium, anamiticum, lusitanum, et, latinum, annamite, portuguese, latin, dictionary, of, alexandre, de, rhodes, 1651, introduced, the, modern, orthography, of, vietnamese, which, is, based, on, the, orthography, of, 17th, century, portuguese, the, romanization, of, chinese, was, also, influenced, by, the, portuguese, language, among, others, particularly, regarding, chinese, surnames, one, example, is, mei, during, 1583, 88, italian, jesuits, michele, ruggieri, and, matteo, ricci, created, a, portuguese, chinese, dictionary, the, first, ever, european, chinese, dictionary, for, instance, as, portuguese, merchants, were, presumably, the, first, to, introduce, the, sweet, orange, in, europe, in, several, modern, indo, european, languages, the, fruit, has, been, named, after, them, some, examples, are, albanian, portokall, bosnian, archaic, portokal, prtokal, bulgarian, portokal, greek, portok, li, macedonian, portokal, persian, porteghal, and, romanian, portocal, related, names, can, be, found, in, other, languages, such, as, arabic, burtuq, l, georgian, p, ort, oxali, turkish, portakal, and, amharic, birtukan, also, in, southern, italian, dialects, e, g, neapolitan, an, orange, is, portogallo, or, purtuallo, literally, the, portuguese, one, in, contrast, to, standard, italian, arancia, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, the, extensive, contacts, between, portuguese, travelers, and, settlers, african, and, asian, slaves, and, local, populations, led, to, the, appearance, of, many, pidgins, with, varying, amounts, of, portuguese, influence, as, each, of, these, pidgins, became, the, mother, tongue, of, succeeding, generations, they, evolved, into, fully, fledged, creole, languages, which, remained, in, use, in, many, parts, of, asia, africa, and, south, america, until, the, 18th, century, some, portuguese, based, or, portuguese, influenced, creoles, are, still, spoken, today, by, over, three, million, people, worldwide, especially, people, of, partial, portuguese, ancestry, portuguese, phonology, is, similar, to, those, of, languages, such, as, franco, proven, al, and, catalan, whereas, that, of, spanish, is, similar, to, those, of, sardinian, and, the, southern, italian, dialects, some, would, describe, the, phonology, of, portuguese, as, a, blend, of, spanish, gallo, romance, e, g, french, and, the, languages, of, northern, italy, especially, genoese, portuguese, can, have, as, many, as, 9, oral, vowels, as, many, as, 2, semivowels, and, as, many, as, 21, consonants, some, varieties, of, the, language, have, fewer, phonemes, there, are, also, five, nasal, vowels, which, some, linguists, regard, as, allophones, of, oral, vowels, galician, portuguese, developed, in, the, region, of, the, former, roman, province, of, gallaecia, from, the, vulgar, latin, common, latin, that, had, been, introduced, by, roman, soldiers, colonists, and, magistrates, during, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, although, the, process, may, have, been, slower, than, in, other, regions, after, a, period, of, bilingualism, the, centuries, of, contact, with, vulgar, latin, completely, extinguished, the, native, languages, and, a, variety, of, latin, with, a, few, gallaecian, features, evolved, gallaecian, and, lusitanian, influences, were, absorbed, into, the, local, dialect, of, vulgar, latin, this, can, be, detected, in, some, galician, portuguese, words, as, well, as, in, placenames, of, celtic, and, iberian, origin, an, early, form, of, galician, portuguese, was, already, spoken, in, the, kingdom, of, the, suebi, and, by, the, year, 800, galician, portuguese, had, already, become, the, vernacular, of, northwestern, iberia, the, first, known, phonetic, changes, in, vulgar, latin, which, began, the, evolution, to, galician, portuguese, took, place, during, the, rule, of, the, germanic, groups, the, suebi, 411, 585, and, visigoths, 585, 711, the, galician, portuguese, inflected, infinitive, or, personal, infinitive, and, the, nasal, vowels, may, have, evolved, under, the, influence, of, local, celtic, as, in, old, french, the, nasal, vowels, would, thus, be, a, phonologic, characteristic, of, the, vulgar, latin, spoken, in, roman, gallaecia, but, they, are, not, attested, in, writing, until, after, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, like, catalan, and, german, portuguese, uses, vowel, quality, to, contrast, stressed, syllables, with, unstressed, syllables, unstressed, isolated, vowels, tend, to, be, raised, and, sometimes, centralized, phonetic, notes, portuguese, orthography, is, based, on, the, latin, alphabet, and, makes, use, of, the, acute, accent, the, circumflex, accent, the, grave, accent, the, tilde, and, the, cedilla, to, denote, stress, vowel, height, nasalization, and, other, sound, changes, the, diaeresis, was, abolished, by, the, last, orthography, agreement, accented, letters, and, digraphs, are, not, counted, as, separate, characters, for, collation, purposes, a, notable, aspect, of, the, grammar, of, portuguese, is, the, verb, morphologically, more, verbal, inflections, from, classical, latin, have, been, preserved, by, portuguese, than, by, any, other, major, romance, language, portuguese, and, spanish, share, very, similar, grammar, vocabulary, and, sentence, structure, portuguese, also, has, some, grammatical, innovations, not, found, in, other, romance, languages, except, galician, and, fala, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, portuguese, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, english
