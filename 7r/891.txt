counterinsurgency, coin, or, nato, spelling, counter, insurgency, is, the, totality, of, actions, aimed, at, defeating, irregular, forces, the, oxford, english, dictionary, defines, counterinsurgency, as, any, military, or, political, action, taken, against, the, activities, of, guerrillas, or, revolutionaries, and, can, be, considered, war, by, a, state, against, a, non, state, adversary, insurgency, and, counterinsurgency, campaigns, have, been, waged, since, ancient, history, however, modern, thinking, on, counterinsurgency, was, developed, during, decolonization, during, insurgency, and, counterinsurgency, the, distinction, between, civilians, and, combatants, is, often, blurred, counterinsurgency, may, involve, attempting, to, win, the, hearts, and, minds, of, populations, supporting, the, insurgency, alternatively, it, may, be, waged, in, an, attempt, to, intimidate, or, eliminate, civilian, populations, suspected, of, loyalty, to, the, insurgency, through, indiscriminate, violence, the, guerrilla, must, swim, in, the, people, as, the, fish, swims, in, the, sea, aphorism, based, on, the, writing, of, mao, zedong, counterinsurgency, is, normally, conducted, as, a, combination, of, conventional, military, operations, and, other, means, such, as, demoralization, in, the, form, of, propaganda, psy, ops, and, assassinations, counter, insurgency, operations, include, many, different, facets, military, paramilitary, political, economic, psychological, and, civic, actions, taken, to, defeat, insurgency, to, understand, counterinsurgency, one, must, understand, insurgency, to, comprehend, the, dynamics, of, revolutionary, warfare, counter, insurgency, focuses, on, bridging, these, gaps, insurgents, take, advantage, of, social, issues, known, as, gaps, when, the, gaps, are, wide, they, create, a, sea, of, discontent, creating, the, environment, in, which, the, insurgent, can, operate, in, the, insurgent, archipelago, john, mackinlay, puts, forward, the, concept, of, an, evolution, of, the, insurgency, from, the, maoist, paradigm, of, the, golden, age, of, insurgency, to, the, global, insurgency, of, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, he, defines, this, distinction, as, maoist, and, post, maoist, insurgency, the, third, marques, of, santa, cruz, de, marcenado, 1684, 1732, is, probably, the, earliest, author, who, dealt, systematically, in, his, writings, with, counterinsurgency, in, his, reflexiones, militares, published, between, 1726, and, 1730, he, discussed, how, to, spot, early, signs, of, an, incipient, insurgency, prevent, insurgencies, and, counter, them, if, they, could, not, be, warded, off, strikingly, santa, cruz, recognized, that, insurgencies, are, usually, due, to, real, grievances, a, state, rarely, rises, up, without, the, fault, of, its, governors, consequently, he, advocated, clemency, towards, the, population, and, good, governance, to, seek, the, people, s, heart, and, love, liddell, hart, attributed, the, failure, of, counterinsurgencies, to, various, causes, first, as, pointed, out, in, the, insurgency, addendum, to, the, second, version, of, his, book, strategy, the, indirect, approach, a, popular, insurgency, has, an, inherent, advantage, over, any, occupying, force, he, showed, as, a, prime, example, the, french, occupation, of, spain, during, the, napoleonic, wars, whenever, spanish, forces, managed, to, constitute, themselves, into, a, regular, fighting, force, the, superior, french, forces, beat, them, every, time, however, once, dispersed, and, decentralized, the, irregular, nature, of, the, rebel, campaigns, proved, a, decisive, counter, to, french, superiority, on, the, battlefield, napoleon, s, army, had, no, means, of, effectively, combating, the, rebels, and, in, the, end, their, strength, and, morale, were, so, sapped, that, when, wellington, was, finally, able, to, challenge, french, forces, in, the, field, the, french, had, almost, no, choice, but, to, abandon, the, situation, counterinsurgency, efforts, may, be, successful, especially, when, the, insurgents, are, unpopular, the, philippine, american, war, the, shining, path, in, peru, and, the, malayan, emergency, have, been, the, sites, of, failed, insurgencies, hart, also, points, to, the, experiences, of, t, e, lawrence, and, the, arab, revolt, during, world, war, i, as, another, example, of, the, power, of, the, rebel, insurgent, though, the, ottomans, often, had, advantages, in, manpower, of, more, than, 100, to, 1, the, arabs, ability, to, materialize, out, of, the, desert, strike, and, disappear, again, often, left, the, turks, reeling, and, paralyzed, creating, an, opportunity, for, regular, british, forces, to, sweep, in, and, finish, the, turkish, forces, off, in, both, the, preceding, cases, the, insurgents, and, rebel, fighters, were, working, in, conjunction, with, or, in, a, manner, complementary, to, regular, forces, such, was, also, the, case, with, the, french, resistance, during, world, war, ii, and, the, national, liberation, front, during, the, vietnam, war, the, strategy, in, these, cases, is, for, the, irregular, combatant, to, weaken, and, destabilize, the, enemy, to, such, a, degree, that, victory, is, easy, or, assured, for, the, regular, forces, however, in, many, modern, rebellions, one, does, not, see, rebel, fighters, working, in, conjunction, with, regular, forces, rather, they, are, home, grown, militias, or, imported, fighters, who, have, no, unified, goals, or, objectives, save, to, expel, the, occupier, according, to, liddell, hart, there, are, few, effective, counter, measures, to, this, strategy, so, long, as, the, insurgency, maintains, popular, support, it, will, retain, all, of, its, strategic, advantages, of, mobility, invisibility, and, legitimacy, in, its, own, eyes, and, the, eyes, of, the, people, so, long, as, this, is, the, situation, an, insurgency, essentially, cannot, be, defeated, by, regular, forces, david, galula, gained, his, practical, experience, in, counterinsurgency, as, a, french, army, officer, in, the, algerian, war, his, theory, of, counterinsurgency, is, not, primarily, military, but, a, combination, of, military, political, and, social, actions, under, the, strong, control, of, a, single, authority, galula, proposes, four, laws, for, counterinsurgency, galula, contends, that, a, victory, is, not, the, destruction, in, a, given, area, of, the, insurgent, s, forces, and, his, political, organization, a, victory, is, that, plus, the, permanent, isolation, of, the, insurgent, from, the, population, isolation, not, enforced, upon, the, population, but, maintained, by, and, with, the, population, in, conventional, warfare, strength, is, assessed, according, to, military, or, other, tangible, criteria, such, as, the, number, of, divisions, the, position, they, hold, the, industrial, resources, etc, in, revolutionary, warfare, strength, must, be, assessed, by, the, extent, of, support, from, the, population, as, measured, in, terms, of, political, organization, at, the, grassroots, the, counterinsurgent, reaches, a, position, of, strength, when, his, power, is, embedded, in, a, political, organization, issuing, from, and, firmly, supported, by, the, population, with, his, four, principles, in, mind, galula, goes, on, to, describe, a, general, military, and, political, strategy, to, put, them, into, operation, in, an, area, that, is, under, full, insurgent, control, in, a, selected, area, 1, concentrate, enough, armed, forces, to, destroy, or, to, expel, the, main, body, of, armed, insurgents, 2, detach, for, the, area, sufficient, troops, to, oppose, an, insurgent, come, back, in, strength, install, these, troops, in, the, hamlets, villages, and, towns, where, the, population, lives, 3, establish, contact, with, the, population, control, its, movements, in, order, to, cut, off, its, links, with, the, guerrillas, 4, destroy, the, local, insurgent, political, organization, 5, set, up, by, means, of, elections, new, provisional, local, authorities, 6, test, those, authorities, by, assigning, them, various, concrete, tasks, replace, the, softs, and, the, incompetents, give, full, support, to, the, active, leaders, organize, self, defense, units, 7, group, and, educate, the, leaders, in, a, national, political, movement, 8, win, over, or, suppress, the, last, insurgent, remnants, according, to, galula, some, of, these, steps, can, be, skipped, in, areas, that, are, only, partially, under, insurgent, control, and, most, of, them, are, unnecessary, in, areas, already, controlled, by, the, government, thus, the, essence, of, counterinsurgency, warfare, is, summed, up, by, galula, as, build, or, rebuild, a, political, machine, from, the, population, upward, robert, grainger, ker, thompson, wrote, defeating, communist, insurgency, in, 1966, wherein, he, argued, that, a, successful, counterinsurgency, effort, must, be, proactive, in, seizing, the, initiative, from, insurgents, thompson, outlines, five, basic, principles, for, a, successful, counterinsurgency, in, the, three, pillars, of, counterinsurgency, dr, david, kilcullen, the, chief, strategist, of, the, office, of, the, coordinator, for, counterterrorism, of, the, u, s, state, department, in, 2006, described, a, framework, for, interagency, cooperation, in, counterinsurgency, operations, his, pillars, security, political, and, economic, support, the, overarching, goal, of, control, but, are, based, on, information, this, is, because, perception, is, crucial, in, developing, control, and, influence, over, population, groups, substantive, security, political, and, economic, measures, are, critical, but, to, be, effective, they, must, rest, upon, and, integrate, with, a, broader, information, strategy, every, action, in, counterinsurgency, sends, a, message, the, purpose, of, the, information, campaign, is, to, consolidate, and, unify, this, message, importantly, the, information, campaign, has, to, be, conducted, at, a, global, regional, and, local, level, because, modern, insurgents, draw, upon, global, networks, of, sympathy, support, funding, and, recruitment, kilcullen, considers, the, three, pillars, to, be, of, equal, importance, because, unless, they, are, developed, in, parallel, the, campaign, becomes, unbalanced, too, much, economic, assistance, with, inadequate, security, for, example, simply, creates, an, array, of, soft, targets, for, the, insurgents, similarly, too, much, security, assistance, without, political, consensus, or, governance, simply, creates, more, capable, armed, groups, in, developing, each, pillar, we, measure, progress, by, gauging, effectiveness, capability, and, capacity, and, legitimacy, the, degree, to, which, the, population, accepts, that, government, actions, are, in, its, interest, the, overall, goal, according, to, this, model, is, not, to, reduce, violence, to, zero, or, to, kill, every, insurgent, but, rather, to, return, the, overall, system, to, normality, noting, that, normality, in, one, society, may, look, different, from, normality, in, another, in, each, case, we, seek, not, only, to, establish, control, but, also, to, consolidate, that, control, and, then, transfer, it, to, permanent, effective, and, legitimate, institutions, military, historian, martin, van, creveld, noting, that, almost, all, attempts, to, deal, with, insurgency, have, ended, in, failure, advises, the, first, and, absolutely, indispensable, thing, to, do, is, throw, overboard, 99, percent, of, the, literature, on, counterinsurgency, counter, guerrilla, counterterrorism, and, the, like, since, most, of, it, was, written, by, the, losing, side, it, is, of, little, value, in, examining, why, so, many, counterinsurgencies, by, powerful, militaries, fail, against, weaker, enemies, van, creveld, identifies, a, key, dynamic, that, he, illustrates, by, the, metaphor, of, killing, a, child, regardless, of, whether, the, child, started, the, fight, or, how, well, armed, the, child, is, an, adult, in, a, fight, with, a, child, will, feel, that, he, is, acting, unjustly, if, he, harms, the, child, and, foolish, if, the, child, harms, him, he, will, therefore, wonder, if, the, fight, is, necessary, van, creveld, argues, that, by, definition, a, strong, counterinsurgent, who, uses, his, strength, to, kill, the, members, of, a, small, weak, organization, of, insurgents, let, alone, the, civilian, population, by, which, it, is, surrounded, and, which, may, lend, it, support, will, commit, crimes, in, an, unjust, cause, while, a, child, who, is, in, a, serious, fight, with, an, adult, is, justified, in, using, every, and, any, means, available, not, because, he, or, she, is, right, but, because, he, or, she, has, no, choice, every, act, of, insurgency, becomes, from, the, perspective, of, the, counterinsurgent, a, reason, to, end, the, conflict, while, also, being, a, reason, for, the, insurgents, to, continue, until, victory, tr, ng, chinh, second, in, command, to, ho, chi, minh, of, vietnam, wrote, in, his, primer, for, revolt, the, guiding, principle, of, the, strategy, for, our, whole, resistance, must, be, to, prolong, the, war, to, protract, the, war, is, the, key, to, victory, why, must, the, war, be, protracted, if, we, throw, the, whole, of, our, forces, into, a, few, battles, to, try, to, decide, the, outcome, we, shall, certainly, be, defeated, and, the, enemy, will, win, on, the, other, hand, if, while, fighting, we, maintain, our, forces, expand, them, train, our, army, and, people, learn, military, tactics, and, at, the, same, time, wear, down, the, enemy, forces, we, shall, weary, and, discourage, them, in, such, a, way, that, strong, as, they, are, they, will, become, weak, and, will, meet, defeat, instead, of, victory, van, creveld, thus, identifies, time, as, the, key, factor, in, counterinsurgency, in, an, attempt, to, find, lessons, from, the, few, cases, of, successful, counterinsurgency, of, which, he, lists, two, clear, cases, the, british, efforts, during, the, troubles, of, northern, ireland, and, the, 1982, hama, massacre, carried, out, by, the, syrian, government, to, suppress, the, muslim, brotherhood, he, asserts, that, the, core, of, the, difficulty, is, neither, military, nor, political, but, moral, and, outlines, two, distinct, methods, the, first, method, relies, on, superb, intelligence, provided, by, those, who, know, the, natural, and, artificial, environment, of, the, conflict, as, well, as, the, insurgents, once, such, superior, intelligence, is, gained, the, counterinsurgents, must, be, trained, to, a, point, of, high, professionalism, and, discipline, such, that, they, will, exercise, discrimination, and, restraint, through, such, discrimination, and, restraint, the, counterinsurgents, do, not, alienate, members, of, the, populace, besides, those, already, fighting, them, while, delaying, the, time, when, the, counterinsurgents, become, disgusted, by, their, own, actions, and, demoralized, general, patrick, walters, the, british, commander, of, troops, in, northern, ireland, explicitly, stated, that, his, objective, was, not, to, kill, as, many, terrorists, as, possible, but, to, ensure, that, as, few, people, on, both, sides, were, killed, in, the, vast, majority, of, counterinsurgencies, the, forces, of, order, kill, far, more, people, than, they, lose, in, contrast, and, using, very, rough, figures, the, struggle, in, northern, ireland, had, cost, the, united, kingdom, three, thousand, fatal, casualties, of, the, three, thousand, about, seventeen, hundred, were, civilians, of, the, remaining, a, thousand, were, british, soldiers, no, more, than, three, hundred, were, terrorists, a, ratio, of, three, to, one, if, the, prerequisites, for, the, first, method, excellent, intelligence, superbly, trained, and, disciplined, soldiers, and, police, and, an, iron, will, to, avoid, being, provoked, into, lashing, out, are, lacking, van, creveld, posits, that, counterinsurgents, who, still, want, to, win, must, use, the, second, method, exemplified, by, the, hama, massacre, in, 1982, the, regime, of, syrian, president, hafez, al, assad, was, on, the, point, of, being, overwhelmed, by, the, countrywide, insurgency, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, al, assad, sent, a, syrian, army, division, under, his, brother, rifaat, to, the, city, of, hama, known, to, be, the, center, of, the, resistance, following, a, counterattack, by, the, brotherhood, rifaat, used, his, heavy, artillery, to, demolish, the, city, killing, between, 10, 25, 000, people, including, many, women, and, children, asked, by, reporters, what, had, happened, hafez, al, assad, exaggerated, the, damage, and, deaths, promoted, the, commanders, who, carried, out, the, attacks, and, razed, hama, s, well, known, great, mosque, replacing, it, with, a, parking, lot, with, the, muslim, brotherhood, scattered, the, population, was, so, cowed, that, it, would, be, years, before, opposition, groups, dared, to, disobey, the, regime, again, and, van, creveld, argues, the, massacre, most, likely, saved, the, regime, and, prevented, a, bloody, civil, war, van, creveld, condenses, al, assad, s, strategy, into, five, rules, while, noting, that, they, could, easily, have, been, written, by, niccol, machiavelli, in, counterinsurgency, s, impossible, trilemma, dr, lorenzo, zambernardi, an, italian, academic, now, working, in, the, united, states, clarifies, the, tradeoffs, involved, in, counterinsurgency, operations, he, argues, that, counterinsurgency, involves, three, main, goals, but, in, real, practice, a, counterinsurgent, needs, to, choose, two, goals, out, of, three, relying, on, economic, theory, this, is, what, zambernardi, labels, the, impossible, trilemma, of, counterinsurgency, specifically, the, impossible, trilemma, suggests, that, it, is, impossible, to, simultaneously, achieve, 1, force, protection, 2, distinction, between, enemy, combatants, and, non, combatants, and, 3, the, physical, elimination, of, insurgents, according, to, zambernardi, in, pursuing, any, two, of, these, three, goals, a, state, must, forgo, some, portion, of, the, third, objective, in, particular, a, state, can, protect, its, armed, forces, while, destroying, insurgents, but, only, by, indiscriminately, killing, civilians, as, the, ottomans, italians, and, nazis, did, in, the, balkans, libya, and, eastern, europe, it, can, choose, to, protect, civilians, along, with, its, own, armed, forces, instead, avoiding, so, called, collateral, damage, but, only, by, abandoning, the, objective, of, destroying, the, insurgents, finally, a, state, can, discriminate, between, combatants, and, non, combatants, while, killing, insurgents, but, only, by, increasing, the, risks, for, its, own, troops, because, often, insurgents, will, hide, behind, civilians, or, appear, to, be, civilians, so, a, country, must, choose, two, out, of, three, goals, and, develop, a, strategy, that, can, successfully, accomplish, them, while, sacrificing, the, third, objective, zambernardi, s, theory, posits, that, to, protect, populations, which, is, necessary, to, defeat, insurgencies, and, to, physically, destroy, an, insurgency, the, counterinsurgent, s, military, forces, must, be, sacrificed, risking, the, loss, of, domestic, political, support, another, writer, who, explores, a, trio, of, features, relevant, to, understanding, counterinsurgency, is, akali, omeni, within, the, contemporary, context, coin, warfare, by, african, militaries, tends, to, be, at, the, margins, of, the, theoretical, debate, even, though, africa, today, is, faced, with, a, number, of, deadly, insurgencies, in, counter, insurgency, in, nigeria, omeni, a, nigerian, academic, discusses, the, interactions, between, certain, features, away, from, the, battlefield, which, account, for, battlefield, performance, against, insurgent, warfare, specifically, omeni, argues, that, the, trio, of, historical, experience, organisational, culture, oc, and, doctrine, help, explain, the, institution, of, coin, within, militaries, and, their, tendency, to, reject, the, innovation, and, adaptation, often, necessary, to, defeat, insurgency, these, three, features, furthermore, influence, and, can, undermine, the, operational, tactics, and, concepts, adopted, against, insurgents, the, coin, challenge, therefore, is, not, just, operational, it, also, is, cultural, and, institutional, before, ever, it, reflects, on, the, battlefield, according, to, omeni, institutional, isomorphism, is, a, sociological, phenomenon, that, constrains, the, habits, of, a, military, in, this, case, the, nigerian, military, to, the, long, established, yet, increasingly, ineffective, ideology, of, the, offensive, in, irregular, warfare, as, omeni, writes, whereas, the, nigerian, military, s, performance, against, militias, in, the, niger, delta, already, suggested, the, military, had, a, poor, grasp, of, the, threat, of, insurgent, warfare, it, was, further, along, the, line, as, the, military, struggled, against, boko, haram, s, threat, that, the, extent, of, this, weakness, was, exposed, at, best, the, utility, of, force, for, the, nigerian, military, had, become, but, a, temporary, solution, against, the, threat, of, insurgent, warfare, at, worst, the, existing, model, has, been, perpetuated, at, such, high, cost, that, urgent, revisionist, thinking, around, the, idea, of, counterinsurgency, within, the, military, institution, may, now, be, required, additionally, the, military, s, decisive, civil, war, victory, the, pivot, in, nigeria, s, strategic, culture, towards, a, regional, role, and, the, institutional, delegitimization, brought, about, by, decades, of, coups, and, political, meddling, meant, that, much, time, went, by, without, substantive, revisionism, to, the, military, s, thinking, around, its, internal, function, change, moreover, where, it, occurred, was, institutionally, isomorphic, and, not, as, far, removed, from, the, military, s, own, origins, as, the, intervening, decades, may, have, suggested, further, the, infantry, centric, nature, of, the, nigerian, army, s, battalions, traceable, back, to, the, nigerian, civil, war, back, in, the, 1960s, is, reflected, in, the, kinetic, nature, of, the, army, s, contemporary, coin, approach, this, approach, has, failed, to, defeat, boko, haram, in, the, way, many, expected, certainly, therefore, the, popular, argument, today, which, holds, that, the, nigerian, army, has, struggled, in, coin, due, to, capabilities, shortcomings, holds, some, merit, however, a, full, spectrum, analysis, of, the, nigeria, case, suggests, that, this, popular, dominant, narrative, scarcely, scratches, the, surface, of, the, true, coin, challenge, this, population, centered, challenge, moreover, is, one, that, militaries, across, the, world, continue, to, contend, with, and, in, attempting, to, solve, the, coin, puzzle, state, forces, over, the, decades, have, tried, a, range, of, tactics, starting, in, the, early, 2000s, micro, level, data, has, transformed, the, analysis, of, effective, counterinsurgency, coin, operations, leading, this, work, is, the, information, centric, group, of, theorists, and, researchers, led, by, the, work, of, the, empirical, studies, of, conflict, esoc, group, at, princeton, university, and, the, conflict, and, peace, research, and, development, cprd, group, at, the, university, of, michigan, berman, shapiro, and, felter, have, outlined, the, modern, information, centric, model, in, this, framework, the, critical, determinant, of, counterinsurgent, success, is, information, about, insurgents, provided, to, counterinsurgents, such, as, insurgent, locations, plans, and, targets, information, can, be, acquired, from, civilian, sources, human, intelligence, humint, or, through, signals, intelligence, sigint, dr, jeffrey, treistman, previously, served, with, the, us, department, of, state, as, the, policy, advisor, to, the, deputy, prime, minister, of, iraq, salam, al, zaubai, in, his, book, when, bad, states, win, rethinking, counterinsurgency, strategy, he, found, little, evidence, to, support, the, hearts, and, minds, approach, to, counterinsurgency, there, is, little, robust, generalizable, evidence, that, population, centric, approaches, are, effective, he, argued, in, contrast, to, other, coin, theorists, treistman, examined, how, the, gross, violation, of, international, law, and, human, rights, affected, war, outcomes, he, developed, a, theory, of, barbarism, as, a, counterinsurgency, strategy, the, indiscriminate, use, of, violence, against, civilians, to, defeat, insurgents, he, proposed, that, under, certain, conditions, genocide, rape, torture, repression, and, other, human, rights, violations, could, succeed, in, suppressing, a, rebellion, treistman, theorized, that, moderate, levels, of, violence, against, civilians, would, not, be, effective, in, dissuading, insurgents, but, if, counterinsurgents, increased, their, lethality, cruelty, and, violence, against, civilians, it, would, successfully, deter, insurgents, the, overwhelming, and, brutal, application, of, force, against, civilians, he, argued, will, squash, domestic, opposition, treistman, thus, proposed, a, convex, function, to, model, the, relationship, between, barbarism, and, counterinsurgency, outcomes, moderate, levels, of, repression, are, insufficient, and, counterproductive, but, as, a, counterinsurgent, increases, the, degree, of, lethality, and, repression, it, is, more, likely, to, defeat, insurgents, widespread, indiscriminate, violence, and, political, repression, increase, the, odds, of, a, government, victory, as, a, result, bad, states, may, sometimes, defeat, insurgencies, with, regard, to, tactics, the, terms, drain,

deprives, the, aforementioned, of, the, support, cover, and, resources, of, the, local, population, this, is, typically, targeted, in, that, it, specifically, targets, the, demographic, that, supports, the, insurgency, in, a, limited, area, where, insurgency, is, taking, place, but, is, indiscriminate, from, an, individual, perspective, examples, of, use, of, this, technique, in, counterinsurgency, include, bar, kokhba, revolt, second, anglo, boer, war, greek, civil, war, general, order, no, 11, 1863, in, the, american, civil, war, rohingya, conflict, and, xinjiang, conflict,

contemporary, times, concerns, about, public, opinion, and, international, law, can, rule, out, counterinsurgency, campaigns, using, indiscriminate, violence, assassination, of, leaders, can, be, a,

be, found, in, its, initial, use, by, marshal, hubert, lyautey, the, main, theoretician, of, french, colonial, warfare, and, counterinsurgency, strategy, the, oil, spot, approach, was, later, one, of, the, justifications, given, in, the, pentagon, papers, for, the, strategic, hamlet, program, cordon, and, search, is, a, military, tactic, one, of, the, basic, counterinsurgency, operations, in, which, an, area, is, cordoned, off, and, premises, are, searched, for, weapons, or, insurgents, other, related, operations, are, cordon, and, knock, and, cordon, and, kick, cordon, and, search, is, part, of, a, new, doctrine, called, stability, and, support, operations, or, saso, it, is, a, technique, used, where, there, is, no, hard, intelligence, of, weapons, in, the, house, and, therefore, is, less, intense, than, a, normal, house, search, it, is, used, in, urban, neighborhoods, the, purpose, of, the, mission, is, to, search, a, house, with, as, little, inconvenience, to, the, resident, family, as, possible, air, power, can, play, an, important, role, in, counterinsurgency, capable, of, carrying, out, a, wide, range, of, operations, in, general, david, petraeus, counterinsurgency, field, manual, one, of, the, many, tactics, described, to, help, win, in, counterinsurgency, warfare, involves, the, use, of, public, diplomacy, through, military, means, counterinsurgency, is, effective, when, it, is, integrated, into, a, comprehensive, strategy, employing, all, instruments, of, national, power, including, public, diplomacy, the, goal, of, coin, operations, is, to, render, the, insurgents, as, ineffective, and, non, influential, by, having, strong, and, secure, relations, with, the, population, of, the, host, nation, an, understanding, of, the, host, nation, and, the, environment, that, the, coin, operations, will, take, place, in, is, essential, public, diplomacy, in, coin, warfare, is, only, effective, when, there, is, a, clear, understanding, of, the, culture, and, population, at, hand, one, of, the, largest, factors, needed, for, defeating, an, insurgency, involves, understanding, the, populace, how, they, interact, with, the, insurgents, how, they, interact, with, non, government, organizations, in, the, area, and, how, they, view, the, counterinsurgency, operations, themselves, ethics, is, a, common, public, diplomacy, aspect, that, is, emphasized, in, coin, warfare, insurgents, win, their, war, by, attacking, internal, will, and, the, international, opposition, to, combat, these, tactics, the, counterinsurgency, operations, need, to, treat, their, prisoners, and, detainees, humanely, and, according, to, american, values, and, principles, by, doing, this, coin, operations, show, the, host, nation, s, population, that, they, can, be, trusted, and, that, they, are, concerned, about, the, well, being, of, the, population, to, be, successful, in, warfare, a, population, that, expects, the, incumbent, government, to, deliver, public, goods, services, and, security, frequently, supports, the, counterinsurgency, and, a, major, event, that, increases, popular, expectations, of, future, public, goods, and, service, delivery, can, trigger, a, shift, in, public, attitudes, away, from, the, insurgency, and, toward, the, counterinsurgency, political, social, and, economic, programs, are, usually, more, valuable, than, conventional, military, operations, in, addressing, the, root, causes, of, the, conflict, and, undermining, the, insurgency, these, programs, are, essential, in, order, to, gain, the, support, of, the, population, these, programs, are, designed, to, make, the, local, population, feel, secure, safe, and, more, aligned, with, the, counterinsurgency, efforts, this, enables, the, citizens, of, the, host, nation, to, trust, the, goals, and, purposes, of, the, counterinsurgency, efforts, as, opposed, to, the, insurgents, a, counterinsurgency, is, a, battle, of, ideas, and, the, implementation, and, integration, of, these, programs, is, important, for, success, social, political, and, economic, programs, should, be, coordinated, and, administered, by, the, host, nation, s, leaders, as, well, successful, coin, warfare, allows, the, population, to, see, that, the, counterinsurgency, efforts, are, including, the, host, nation, in, their, re, building, programs, the, war, is, fought, among, the, people, and, for, the, people, between, the, insurgents, and, the, counterinsurgents, a, counterinsurgency, is, won, by, utilizing, strategic, communications, and, information, operations, successfully, a, counterinsurgency, is, a, competition, of, ideas, ideologies, and, socio, political, movements, in, order, to, combat, insurgent, ideologies, one, must, understand, the, values, and, characteristics, of, the, ideology, or, religion, additionally, counterinsurgency, efforts, need, to, understand, the, culture, of, which, the, insurgency, resides, in, order, to, strategically, launch, information, and, communication, operations, against, the, insurgent, ideology, or, religion, counterinsurgency, information, operatives, need, to, also, identify, key, audiences, communicators, and, public, leaders, to, know, whom, to, influence, and, reach, out, to, with, their, information, public, diplomacy, in, information, operations, can, only, be, achieved, by, a, complete, understanding, of, the, culture, it, is, operating, in, counterinsurgency, operations, must, be, able, to, perceive, the, world, from, the, locals, perspective, to, develop, a, comprehensive, cultural, picture, counterinsurgency, efforts, should, invest, in, employing, media, consultants, finance, and, business, experts, psychologists, organizational, network, analysts, and, scholars, from, a, wide, range, of, disciplines, most, importantly, counterinsurgency, efforts, need, to, be, able, to, understand, why, the, local, population, is, drawn, into, the, insurgent, ideology, like, what, aspects, are, appealing, and, how, insurgents, use, the, information, to, draw, their, followers, into, the, ideology, counterinsurgency, communication, efforts, need, a, baseline, understanding, of, values, attitudes, and, perceptions, of, the, people, in, the, area, of, operations, to, conduct, successful, public, diplomacy, to, defeat, the, enemy, developing, information, and, communication, strategies, involve, providing, a, legitimate, alternate, ideology, improving, security, and, economic, opportunity, and, strengthening, family, ties, outside, of, the, insurgency, in, order, to, conduct, public, diplomacy, through, these, means, counterinsurgency, communication, needs, to, match, its, deeds, with, its, words, information, provided, through, public, diplomacy, during, a, counterinsurgency, cannot, lie, the, information, and, communication, to, the, people, always, have, to, be, truthful, and, trustworthy, in, order, to, be, effective, at, countering, the, insurgents, public, diplomacy, in, counterinsurgency, to, influence, the, public, thoughts, and, ideas, is, a, long, time, engagement, and, should, not, be, done, through, negative, campaigning, about, the, enemy, conducting, public, diplomacy, through, relaying, information, and, communicating, with, the, public, in, a, counterinsurgency, is, most, successful, when, a, conversation, can, happen, between, the, counterinsurgency, team, and, the, local, population, of, the, area, of, operation, building, rapport, with, the, public, involves, listening, paying, attention, and, being, responsive, and, proactive, which, is, sufficient, for, the, local, population, to, understand, and, trust, the, counterinsurgency, efforts, and, vice, versa, this, relationship, is, stringent, upon, the, counterinsurgents, keeping, their, promises, providing, security, to, the, locals, and, communicating, their, message, directly, and, quickly, in, times, of, need, understanding, and, influencing, the, cognitive, dimension, of, the, local, population, is, essential, to, winning, counterinsurgency, warfare, the, people, s, perception, of, legitimacy, about, the, host, nation, and, the, foreign, country, s, counterinsurgency, efforts, is, where, success, is, determined, the, free, flow, of, information, present, in, all, theaters, via, television, telephone, and, internet, can, present, conflicting, messages, and, quickly, defeat, the, intended, effects, coordination, between, the, counterinsurgency, operations, the, host, nation, and, the, local, media, in, the, information, presented, to, the, public, is, essential, to, showing, and, influencing, how, the, local, population, perceives, the, counterinsurgency, efforts, and, the, host, nation, public, opinion, the, media, and, rumors, influence, how, the, people, view, counterinsurgency, the, government, hosting, their, efforts, and, the, host, nation, legitimacy, the, use, of, public, diplomacy, to, strategically, relay, the, correct, messages, and, information, to, the, public, is, essential, to, success, in, a, counterinsurgency, operation, for, example, close, relationships, with, media, members, in, the, area, is, essential, to, ensure, that, the, locals, understand, the, counterinsurgency, objectives, and, feel, secure, with, the, host, nation, government, and, the, counterinsurgency, efforts, if, the, local, media, is, not, in, sync, with, the, counterinsurgency, operatives, then, they, could, spread, incomplete, or, false, information, about, the, counterinsurgency, campaign, to, the, public, given, al, qaeda, s, global, reach, the, united, states, must, develop, a, more, integrated, strategic, communication, strategy, for, counter, insurgency, with, its, allies, to, diminish, violent, rhetoric, improve, its, image, abroad, and, detect, deter, and, defeat, this, social, movement, at, its, many, levels, information, operations, and, communicative, abilities, are, one, of, the, largest, and, most, influential, aspects, of, public, diplomacy, within, a, counterinsurgency, public, diplomacy, is, especially, important, as, modern, insurgents, are, more, easily, able, to, gain, support, through, a, variety, of, sources, both, local, and, transnational, thanks, to, advances, in, increased, communication, and, globalization, consequently, modern, counter, insurgency, requires, attention, to, be, focused, on, an, insurgency, s, ecosystem, from, the, national, to, the, local, level, in, order, to, deprive, the, insurgency, of, support, and, prevent, future, insurgent, groups, from, forming, during, the, vietnam, war, counterinsurgency, initially, formed, part, of, the, earlier, war, as, diem, had, implemented, the, poorly, conceived, strategic, hamlet, program, a, similar, model, to, the, malayan, emergency, that, had, the, opposite, effect, by, leading, to, increased, recruitment, to, the, viet, cong, similarly, economic, and, rural, development, formed, a, key, strategy, as, part, of, rural, affairs, development, while, the, earlier, war, was, marked, by, considerable, emphasis, on, counterinsurgency, programs, the, us, armed, forces, initially, relied, on, very, little, if, any, theoretical, doctrine, of, counterinsurgency, during, the, ground, intervention, phase, conventional, warfare, using, massive, firepower, and, the, failure, to, implement, adequate, counterinsurgency, had, extremely, negative, effects, which, was, the, strategy, that, the, nva, adeptly, used, to, countering, by, the, protracted, political, and, military, warfare, model, after, the, replacement, of, general, william, westmoreland, newer, concepts, were, tried, including, a, revival, of, earlier, coin, strategies, including, civil, operations, and, revolutionary, development, support, the, us, and, its, allies, later, implemented, the, phoenix, program, which, targeted, the, viet, cong, political, infrastructure, through, capture, defection, or, assassination, of, viet, cong, members, the, program, was, very, successful, at, suppressing, viet, cong, political, and, revolutionary, activities, british, forces, used, the, relocation, method, with, considerable, success, during, the, malayan, emergency, the, briggs, plan, implemented, fully, in, 1950, relocated, chinese, malayans, into, protected, new, villages, designated, by, british, forces, by, the, end, of, 1951, some, 400, 000, ethnic, chinese, had, moved, into, the, fortifications, of, that, population, the, british, forces, formed, a, home, guard, an, armed, resistance, against, the, malayan, communist, party, an, implementation, that, was, later, mirrored, by, the, strategic, hamlet, program, which, used, by, us, forces, in, south, vietnam, despite, british, claims, of, a, victory, in, the, malayan, emergency, the, military, historian, martin, van, creveld, noted, that, the, results, of, the, counterinsurgency, the, withdrawal, of, british, forces, and, the, establishment, of, an, independent, state, are, identical, to, those, of, aden, kenya, and, cyprus, which, are, not, considered, victories, the, dutch, formulated, a, new, strategy, of, counterinsurgency, warfare, during, the, aceh, war, by, deploying, light, armed, marechaussee, units, and, using, scorched, earth, tactics, in, 1898, van, heutsz, was, proclaimed, governor, of, aceh, and, with, his, lieutenant, who, later, became, dutch, prime, minister, hendrikus, colijn, they, finally, conquered, most, of, aceh, they, followed, christiaan, snouck, hurgronje, s, suggestions, of, finding, cooperative, uleebalang, or, secular, chiefs, to, support, them, in, the, countryside, and, to, isolate, the, resistance, from, its, rural, support, base, during, the, south, sulawesi, campaign, captain, raymond, westerling, of, the, kst, special, forces, of, the, royal, netherlands, east, indies, army, used, the, westerling, method, westerling, ordered, the, registration, of, all, javanese, arriving, in, makassar, because, of, the, large, numbers, of, javanese, participating, in, the, sulawesi, resistance, he, also, used, scouts, to, infiltrate, local, villages, and, to, identify, members, of, the, resistance, based, on, their, information, and, that, of, the, dutch, military, intelligence, service, the, dst, surrounded, one, of, more, suspected, villages, during, night, and, drove, the, population, to, a, central, location, at, daybreak, the, operation, began, often, led, by, westerling, men, would, be, separated, from, women, and, children, from, the, information, gathered, westerling, exposed, certain, people, as, terrorists, and, murderers, who, were, shot, without, any, further, investigation, afterwards, westerling, forced, local, communities, to, refrain, from, supporting, guerillas, by, swearing, on, the, quran, and, it, established, local, self, defence, units, with, some, members, recruited, from, former, guerrillas, deemed, as, redeemable, westerling, directed, eleven, operations, throughout, the, campaign, he, succeeded, in, eliminating, the, insurgency, and, undermining, local, support, for, the, republicans, his, actions, restored, dutch, rule, in, southern, sulawesi, however, the, netherlands, east, indies, government, and, the, dutch, army, command, soon, realised, that, westerling, s, notoriety, led, to, growing, public, criticism, in, april, 1947, the, dutch, government, instituted, an, official, inquiry, of, his, controversial, methods, westerling, was, put, on, the, sidelines, and, was, relieved, of, his, duties, in, november, 1948, france, had, major, counterinsurgency, wars, in, its, colonies, in, indochina, and, algeria, mcclintock, cited, the, basic, points, of, french, doctrine, as, much, of, the, thinking, was, informed, by, the, work, of, earlier, leading, french, theoreticians, of, colonial, warfare, and, counterinsurgency, marshals, bugeaud, gallieni, and, lyautey, wmcclintock, cites, the, 1894, algerian, governor, jules, cambon, as, saying, by, destroying, the, administration, and, local, government, we, were, also, suppressing, our, means, of, action, the, result, is, that, we, are, today, confronted, by, a, sort, of, human, dust, on, which, we, have, no, influence, and, in, which, movements, take, place, which, are, unknown, to, us, cambon, s, philosophy, however, did, not, seem, to, survive, into, the, algerian, war, of, independence, 1954, 1962, post, war, doctrine, as, in, indochina, took, a, more, drastic, view, of, guerre, r, volutionnaire, which, presented, an, ideological, and, global, war, with, a, commitment, to, total, war, countermeasures, in, principle, needed, to, be, both, political, and, military, no, measure, was, too, drastic, to, meet, the, new, threat, of, revolution, french, forces, taking, control, from, the, japanese, did, not, seem, to, negotiate, seriously, with, nationalist, elements, in, what, was, to, become, vietnam, which, reaped, the, consequences, of, overconfidence, at, i, n, bi, n, ph, it, occurred, to, various, commanders, that, soldiers, who, were, trained, to, operate, as, guerrillas, would, have, a, strong, sense, of, how, to, fight, guerrillas, before, the, partition, of, french, indochina, french, groupement, de, commandos, mixtes, a, roport, s, gcma, led, by, roger, trinquier, took, on, this, role, drawing, on, french, experience, with, the, jedburgh, teams, gcma, operating, in, tonkin, and, laos, under, french, intelligence, was, complemented, by, commandos, nord, vi, t, nam, in, the, north, in, those, missions, the, sof, teams, lived, and, fought, with, the, locals, one, laotian, who, became, an, officer, was, vang, pao, who, was, to, become, a, general, in, hmong, and, laotian, operations, in, southeast, asia, while, the, us, forces, increased, their, role, the, french, counterinsurgency, in, colonial, algeria, was, a, savage, one, the, 1957, battle, of, algiers, resulted, in, 24, 000, detentions, with, most, tortured, and, an, estimated, 3, 000, killed, it, may, have, broken, the, national, liberation, front, infrastructure, in, algiers, but, it, also, killed, off, french, legitimacy, as, far, as, hearts, and, minds, went, counterinsurgency, requires, an, extremely, capable, intelligence, infrastructure, that, is, endowed, with, human, sources, and, deep, cultural, knowledge, that, contributes, to, the, difficulty, of, foreign, as, opposed, to, indigenous, powers, in, counterinsurgency, operations, one, of, france, s, most, influential, theorists, was, roger, trinquier, the, modern, warfare, counterinsurgency, strategy, described, by, trinquier, who, had, led, anti, communist, guerrillas, in, indochina, was, a, strong, influence, on, french, efforts, in, algeria, trinquier, suggested, three, principles, trinquier, s, view, was, that, torture, had, to, be, extremely, focused, and, limited, but, many, french, officers, considered, its, use, to, be, corrosive, to, their, own, side, there, were, strong, protests, among, french, leaders, the, army, s, most, decorated, officer, general, jacques, p, ris, de, bollardi, re, confronted, general, jacques, massu, the, commander, of, french, forces, in, the, battle, of, algiers, over, orders, institutionalizing, torture, as, an, unleashing, of, deplorable, instincts, which, no, longer, knew, any, limits, he, issued, an, open, letter, condemning, the, danger, to, the, army, of, the, loss, of, its, moral, values, under, the, fallacious, pretext, of, immediate, expediency, and, was, imprisoned, for, sixty, days, as, some, of, the, french, army, protested, others, increased, the, intensity, of, their, approach, which, led, to, an, attempted, military, coup, against, the, french, fourth, republic, itself, massu, and, general, raoul, salan, led, a, 1958, coup, in, algiers, to, demand, a, new, republic, under, charles, de, gaulle, when, de, gaulle, s, policies, toward, algeria, such, as, a, 1961, referendum, on, algerian, self, determination, did, not, meet, the, expectations, of, the, colonial, officers, salan, formed, the, underground, organisation, arm, e, secr, te, oas, a, right, wing, terrorist, group, whose, actions, included, a, 1962, assassination, attempt, against, de, gaulle, himself, france, has, had, taken, barnett, s, leviathan, role, in, chad, and, ivory, coast, the, latter, on, two, occasions, most, significantly, in, 2002, 2003, the, situation, with, france, and, ivory, coast, is, not, a, classic, fid, situation, as, france, attacked, ivorian, forces, that, had, provoked, un, peacekeepers, another, noteworthy, instance, of, counterinsurgency, in, west, africa, is, the, nigerian, armed, forces, experience, against, the, boko, haram, insurgency, military, operations, against, boko, haram, occur, predominantly, in, the, far, northeast, areas, of, nigeria, the, operations, have, been, ongoing, since, june, 2011, and, have, greatly, expanded, within, the, lake, chad, basin, sub, region, of, west, africa, there, have, been, many, insurgencies, in, india, since, its, independence, in, 1947, the, kashmir, insurgency, which, started, by, 1989, was, brought, under, control, by, the, indian, government, and, violence, has, been, reduced, a, branch, of, the, indian, army, known, as, the, rashtriya, rifles, rr, was, created, for, the, sole, purpose, of, destroying, the, insurgency, in, kashmir, and, it, has, played, a, major, role, in, doing, so, the, rr, was, well, supported, by, central, reserve, police, force, crpf, border, security, force, bsf, indo, tibetan, border, police, itbp, and, state, government, police, the, counter,

states, the, united, kingdom, france, russia, kazakhstan, tajikistan, bangladesh, and, vietnam, have, attended, this, school, portugal, s, experience, in, counterinsurgency, resulted, from, the, pacification, campaigns, conducted, in, the, portuguese, african, and, asian, colonies, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, 1960s, and, the, early, 1970s, portugal, conducted, large, scale, counterinsurgency, operations, in, angola, portuguese, guinea, and, mozambique, against, independentist, guerrillas, supported, by, the, eastern, bloc, and, china, as, well, by, some, western, countries, although, the, campaigns, are, collectively, known, as, the, portuguese, colonial, war, there, were, in, fact, three, different, ones, the, angolan, independence, war, the, guinea, bissau, war, of, independence, and, the, mozambican, war, of, independence, the, situation, was, unique, in, that, small, armed, forces, those, of, portugal, conducted, three, counterinsurgency, wars, at, the, same, time, in, three, different, theatres, of, operations, separated, by, thousands, of, kilometres, for, those, operations, portugal, developed, its, own, counterinsurgency, doctrine, the, most, familiar, russian, counterinsurgency, is, the, war, in, afghanistan, from, 1979, to, 1989, however, throughout, the, history, of, the, russian, empire, the, russians, fought, many, counterinsurgencies, as, new, caucasian, and, central, asian, territory, were, occupied, it, was, in, those, conflicts, that, the, russians, developed, the, following, counterinsurgency, tactics, those, tactics, generally, speaking, were, carried, over, into, soviet, use, following, the, 1917, revolution, for, the, most, part, except, for, the, integration, of, political, military, command, this, tactical, blueprint, saw, use, following, the, first, and, second, world, wars, in, dagestan, the, caucasus, central, asia, siberia, lithuania, and, ukraine, that, doctrine, was, ultimately, shown, to, be, inadequate, in, the, soviet, war, in, afghanistan, mostly, because, of, insufficient, troop, commitment, and, in, the, wars, in, chechnya, the, united, states, has, conducted, counterinsurgency, campaigns, during, the, philippine, american, war, the, vietnam, war, the, post, 2001, war, in, afghanistan, and, the, iraq, war, the, wars, in, iraq, and, afghanistan, have, resulted, in, increased, interest, in, counterinsurgency, within, the, american, military, which, was, exemplified, by, the, 2006, publication, of, a, new, joint, army, field, manual, 3, 24, marine, corps, warfighting, publication, no, 3, 33, 5, counterinsurgency, which, replaced, the, documents, separately, published, by, the, army, and, marine, corps, 20, 25, years, prior, views, of, the, doctrine, contained, in, the, manual, have, been, mixed, the, 2014, version, of, fm, 3, 24, mcwp, 3, 33, 5, acquired, a, new, title, insurgencies, and, countering, insurgencies, it, consists, of, three, main, parts, part, one, provides, strategic, and, operational, context, part, two, provides, the, doctrine, for, understanding, insurgencies, and, part, three, provides, doctrine, for, defeating, an, insurgency, in, short, fm, 3, 24, mcwp, 3, 33, 5, is, organized, to, provide, the, context, of, a, problem, the, problem, and, possible, solutions, william, b, caldwell, iv, wrote, the, law, of, armed, conflict, requires, that, to, use, force, combatants, must, distinguish, individuals, presenting, a, threat, from, innocent, civilians, this, basic, principle, is, accepted, by, all, disciplined, militaries, in, the, counterinsurgency, disciplined, application, of, force, is, even, more, critical, because, our, enemies, camouflage, themselves, in, the, civilian, population, our, success, in, iraq, depends, on, our, ability, to, treat, the, civilian, population, with, humanity, and, dignity, even, as, we, remain, ready, to, immediately, defend, ourselves, or, iraqi, civilians, when, a, threat, is, detected, in, the, recent, conflicts, the, 101st, airborne, division, air, assault, has, been, increasingly, involved, conducting, special, operations,
