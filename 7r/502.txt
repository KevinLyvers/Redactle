https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice
justice, in, its, broadest, sense, is, the, concept, that, individuals, are, to, be, treated, in, a, manner, that, is, equitable, and, fair, a, society, in, which, justice, has, been, achieved, would, be, one, in, which, individuals, receive, what, they, deserve, the, interpretation, of, what, deserve, means, draws, on, a, variety, of, fields, and, philosophical, branches, including, ethics, rationality, law, religion, equity, and, fairness, the, state, may, be, said, to, pursue, justice, by, operating, courts, and, enforcing, their, rulings, a, variety, of, philosophical, and, moral, theories, have, been, advanced, to, inform, understanding, of, justice, early, theories, of, justice, were, set, out, by, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, plato, in, his, work, the, republic, and, aristotle, in, his, nicomachean, ethics, and, politics, religious, explanations, of, justice, can, be, grouped, under, the, divine, command, theory, which, holds, that, justice, issues, from, god, western, thinkers, later, advanced, different, theories, about, where, the, foundations, of, justice, lie, in, the, 17th, century, philosophers, such, as, john, locke, said, justice, derives, from, natural, law, social, contract, theory, advocated, by, thinkers, such, as, jean, jacques, rousseau, says, that, justice, derives, from, the, mutual, agreement, of, members, of, society, to, be, governed, in, a, political, order, in, the, 19th, century, utilitarian, philosophers, such, as, john, stuart, mill, said, that, justice, is, served, by, what, creates, the, best, outcomes, for, the, greatest, number, of, people, modern, frameworks, include, concepts, such, as, distributive, justice, egalitarianism, retributive, justice, and, restorative, justice, distributive, justice, considers, what, is, fair, based, on, what, goods, are, to, be, distributed, between, whom, they, are, to, be, distributed, and, what, is, the, proper, distribution, egalitarians, suggest, justice, can, only, exist, within, the, coordinates, of, equality, theories, of, retributive, justice, say, justice, is, served, by, punishing, wrongdoers, whereas, restorative, justice, also, sometimes, called, reparative, justice, is, an, approach, to, justice, that, focuses, on, the, needs, of, victims, and, offenders, justice, according, to, plato, is, about, balance, and, harmony, it, represents, the, right, relationship, between, conflicting, aspects, within, an, individual, or, a, community, he, defines, justice, as, everyone, having, and, doing, what, they, are, responsible, for, or, what, belongs, to, them, in, other, words, a, just, person, is, someone, who, contributes, to, society, according, to, their, unique, abilities, and, receives, what, is, proportionate, to, their, contribution, they, are, in, the, right, place, always, striving, to, do, their, best, and, reciprocating, what, they, receive, in, a, fair, and, equitable, manner, this, applies, both, at, the, individual, level, and, at, the, organizational, and, societal, levels, an, example, of, a, justice, according, to, plato, s, character, socrates, would, be, a, person, is, born, to, be, a, cobbler, their, nature, who, has, the, virtue, temperance, of, the, economic, class, social, position, employed, as, a, cobbler, occupation, and, doing, their, work, well, expertise, thus, benefitting, the, state, s, economy, for, all, others, happiness, which, has, the, form, of, good, contrariwise, an, example, of, injustice, would, be, a, person, whose, nature, is, that, of, a, cobbler, their, nature, who, lacks, the, virtue, wisdom, needed, from, the, ruling, class, social, position, and, is, employed, as, head, of, state, occupation, doing, that, work, poorly, expertise, thus, ruining, the, government, military, and, economy, which, provide, for, the, happiness, of, all, citizens, which, fits, within, the, form, of, bad, to, illustrate, these, ideas, plato, describes, a, person, s, as, having, three, parts, reason, spirit, and, desire, these, parallel, the, three, parts, of, a, city, in, his, philosophy, which, he, describes, through, the, metaphor, of, a, chariot, it, functions, effectively, when, the, charioteer, representative, of, reason, successfully, controls, the, two, horses, symbolizing, spirit, and, desire, continuing, on, these, themes, plato, theorizes, that, those, who, love, wisdom, or, philosophers, are, the, most, ideal, to, govern, because, only, they, truly, comprehend, the, nature, of, the, good, just, like, one, would, seek, a, doctor, s, expertise, in, matters, of, health, rather, than, a, farmer, s, so, should, the, city, entrust, its, governance, to, someone, knowledgeable, about, the, good, rather, than, to, politicians, who, might, prioritize, power, over, people, s, genuine, needs, socrates, later, used, the, parable, of, the, ship, to, illustrate, this, point, the, unjust, city, is, like, a, ship, in, open, ocean, crewed, by, a, powerful, but, drunken, captain, the, common, people, a, group, of, untrustworthy, advisors, who, try, to, manipulate, the, captain, into, giving, them, power, over, the, ship, s, course, the, politicians, and, a, navigator, the, philosopher, the, latter, of, whom, being, the, only, one, who, knows, how, to, get, the, ship, to, port, advocates, of, divine, command, theory, say, justice, and, indeed, the, whole, of, morality, is, the, authoritative, command, of, god, murder, is, wrong, and, must, be, punished, for, instance, because, god, says, it, so, some, versions, of, the, theory, assert, that, god, must, be, obeyed, because, of, the, nature, of, god, s, relationship, with, humanity, others, assert, that, god, must, be, obeyed, because, god, is, goodness, itself, and, thus, doing, god, s, command, would, be, best, for, everyone, an, early, meditation, on, the, divine, command, theory, by, plato, can, be, found, in, his, dialogue, euthyphro, called, the, euthyphro, dilemma, it, goes, as, follows, is, what, is, morally, good, commanded, by, the, gods, because, it, is, morally, good, or, is, it, morally, good, because, it, is, commanded, by, the, gods, the, implication, is, that, if, the, latter, is, true, then, justice, is, beyond, mortal, understanding, if, the, former, is, true, then, morality, exists, independently, from, the, gods, and, is, therefore, subject, to, the, judgment, of, mortals, a, response, popularized, in, two, contexts, by, immanuel, kant, and, c, s, lewis, is, that, it, is, deductively, valid, to, say, that, the, existence, of, an, objective, morality, implies, the, existence, of, god, and, vice, versa, jews, christians, and, muslims, traditionally, believe, that, justice, is, a, present, real, right, and, specifically, governing, concept, along, with, mercy, and, that, justice, is, ultimately, derived, from, and, held, by, god, according, to, the, bible, such, institutions, as, the, mosaic, law, were, created, by, god, to, require, the, israelites, to, live, by, and, apply, god, s, standards, of, justice, the, hebrew, bible, describes, god, as, saying, about, the, judeo, christian, patriarch, abraham, no, for, i, have, chosen, him, that, he, may, charge, his, children, and, his, household, after, him, to, keep, the, way, of, the, lord, by, doing, righteousness, and, justice, genesis, 18, 19, nrsv, the, psalmist, describes, god, as, having, righteousness, and, justice, the, foundation, of, throne, psalms, 89, 14, nrsv, the, new, testament, also, describes, god, and, jesus, christ, as, having, and, displaying, justice, often, in, comparison, with, god, displaying, and, supporting, mercy, matthew, 5, 7, for, advocates, of, the, theory, that, justice, is, part, of, natural, law, e, g, john, locke, justice, inheres, in, the, nature, of, man, in, republic, by, plato, the, character, thrasymachus, argues, that, justice, is, the, interest, of, the, strong, merely, a, name, for, what, the, powerful, or, cunning, ruler, has, imposed, on, the, people, advocates, of, the, social, contract, say, that, justice, is, derived, from, the, mutual, agreement, of, everyone, or, in, many, versions, from, what, they, would, agree, to, under, hypothetical, conditions, including, equality, and, absence, of, bias, this, account, is, considered, further, below, under, justice, as, fairness, the, absence, of, bias, refers, to, an, equal, ground, for, all, people, involved, in, a, disagreement, or, trial, in, some, cases, according, to, utilitarian, thinkers, including, john, stuart, mill, justice, is, not, as, fundamental, as, we, often, think, rather, it, is, derived, from, the, more, basic, standard, of, rightness, consequentialism, what, is, right, is, what, has, the, best, consequences, usually, measured, by, the, total, or, average, welfare, caused, so, the, proper, principles, of, justice, are, those, that, tend, to, have, the, best, consequences, these, rules, may, turn, out, to, be, familiar, ones, such, as, keeping, contracts, but, equally, they, may, not, depending, on, the, facts, about, real, consequences, either, way, what, is, important, is, those, consequences, and, justice, is, important, if, at, all, only, as, derived, from, that, fundamental, standard, mill, tries, to, explain, our, mistaken, belief, that, justice, is, overwhelmingly, important, by, arguing, that, it, derives, from, two, natural, human, tendencies, our, desire, to, retaliate, against, those, who, hurt, us, or, the, feeling, of, self, defense, and, our, ability, to, put, ourselves, imaginatively, in, another, s, place, sympathy, so, when, we, see, someone, harmed, we, project, ourselves, into, their, situation, and, feel, a, desire, to, retaliate, on, their, behalf, if, this, process, is, the, source, of, our, feelings, about, justice, that, ought, to, undermine, our, confidence, in, them, it, has, been, said, that, systematic, or, programmatic, political, and, moral, philosophy, in, the, west, begins, in, plato, s, republic, with, the, question, what, is, justice, according, to, most, contemporary, theories, of, justice, justice, is, overwhelmingly, important, john, rawls, claims, that, justice, is, the, first, virtue, of, social, institutions, as, truth, is, of, systems, of, thought, in, classical, approaches, evident, from, plato, through, to, rawls, the, concept, of, justice, is, always, construed, in, logical, or, etymological, opposition, to, the, concept, of, injustice, such, approaches, cite, various, examples, of, injustice, as, problems, which, a, theory, of, justice, must, overcome, a, number, of, post, world, war, ii, approaches, do, however, challenge, that, seemingly, obvious, dualism, between, those, two, concepts, justice, can, be, thought, of, as, distinct, from, benevolence, charity, prudence, mercy, generosity, or, compassion, although, these, dimensions, are, regularly, understood, to, also, be, interlinked, justice, is, the, concept, of, cardinal, virtues, of, which, it, is, one, metaphysical, justice, has, often, been, associated, with, concepts, of, fate, reincarnation, or, divine, providence, i, e, with, a, life, in, accordance, with, a, cosmic, plan, the, equivalence, of, justice, and, fairness, has, been, historically, and, culturally, established, in, his, a, theory, of, justice, john, rawls, used, a, social, contract, argument, to, show, that, justice, and, especially, distributive, justice, is, a, form, of, fairness, an, impartial, distribution, of, goods, rawls, asks, us, to, imagine, ourselves, behind, a, veil, of, ignorance, that, denies, us, all, knowledge, of, our, personalities, social, statuses, moral, characters, wealth, talents, and, life, plans, and, then, asks, what, theory, of, justice, we, would, choose, to, govern, our, society, when, the, veil, is, lifted, if, we, wanted, to, do, the, best, that, we, could, for, ourselves, we, do, not, know, who, in, particular, we, are, and, therefore, can, not, bias, the, decision, in, our, own, favor, so, the, decision, in, ignorance, models, fairness, because, it, excludes, selfish, bias, rawls, said, that, each, of, us, would, reject, the, utilitarian, theory, of, justice, that, we, should, maximize, welfare, see, below, because, of, the, risk, that, we, might, turn, out, to, be, someone, whose, own, good, is, sacrificed, for, greater, benefits, for, others, instead, we, would, endorse, rawls, s, two, principles, of, justice, this, imagined, choice, justifies, these, principles, as, the, principles, of, justice, for, us, because, we, would, agree, to, them, in, a, fair, decision, procedure, rawls, s, theory, distinguishes, two, kinds, of, goods, 1, the, good, of, liberty, rights, and, 2, social, and, economic, goods, i, e, wealth, income, and, power, and, applies, different, distributions, to, them, equality, between, citizens, for, 1, equality, unless, inequality, improves, the, position, of, the, worst, off, for, 2, in, one, sense, theories, of, distributive, justice, may, assert, that, everyone, should, get, what, they, deserve, theories, vary, on, the, meaning, of, what, is, deserved, the, main, distinction, is, between, theories, that, say, the, basis, of, just, deserts, ought, to, be, held, equally, by, everyone, and, therefore, derive, egalitarian, accounts, of, distributive, justice, and, theories, that, say, the, basis, of, just, deserts, is, unequally, distributed, on, the, basis, of, for, instance, hard, work, and, therefore, derive, accounts, of, distributive, justice, by, which, some, should, have, more, than, others, studies, at, ucla, in, 2008, have, indicated, that, reactions, to, fairness, are, wired, into, the, brain, and, that, fairness, is, activating, the, same, part, of, the, brain, that, responds, to, food, in, rats, this, is, consistent, with, the, notion, that, being, treated, fairly, satisfies, a, basic, need, research, conducted, in, 2003, at, emory, university, involving, capuchin, monkeys, demonstrated, that, other, cooperative, animals, also, possess, such, a, sense, and, that, inequity, aversion, may, not, be, uniquely, human, instrumental, theories, of, justice, look, at, the, consequences, of, punishment, for, wrongdoing, looking, at, questions, such, as, in, broad, terms, utilitarian, theories, look, forward, to, the, future, consequences, of, punishment, retributive, theories, look, back, to, particular, acts, of, wrongdoing, and, attempt, to, match, them, with, appropriate, punishment, and, restorative, theories, look, at, the, needs, of, victims, and, society, and, seek, to, repair, the, harms, from, wrongdoing, according, to, the, utilitarian, justice, is, the, maximization, of, the, total, or, average, welfare, across, all, relevant, individuals, utilitarianism, fights, crime, in, three, ways, so, the, reason, for, punishment, is, the, maximization, of, welfare, and, punishment, should, be, of, whomever, and, of, whatever, form, and, severity, are, needed, to, meet, that, goal, this, may, sometimes, justify, punishing, the, innocent, or, inflicting, disproportionately, severe, punishments, when, that, will, have, the, best, consequences, overall, perhaps, executing, a, few, suspected, shoplifters, live, on, television, would, be, an, effective, deterrent, to, shoplifting, for, instance, it, also, suggests, that, punishment, might, turn, out, never, to, be, right, depending, on, the, facts, about, what, actual, consequences, it, has, according, to, the, utilitarian, justice, requires, the, maximization, of, the, total, or, average, welfare, across, all, relevant, individuals, this, may, require, sacrifice, of, some, for, the, good, of, others, so, long, as, everyone, s, good, is, taken, impartially, into, account, utilitarianism, in, general, says, that, the, standard, of, justification, for, actions, institutions, or, the, whole, world, is, impartial, welfare, consequentialism, and, only, indirectly, if, at, all, to, do, with, rights, property, need, or, any, other, non, utilitarian, criterion, these, other, criteria, might, be, indirectly, important, to, the, extent, that, human, welfare, involves, them, but, even, then, such, demands, as, human, rights, would, only, be, elements, in, the, calculation, of, overall, welfare, not, uncrossable, barriers, to, action, retributive, justice, argues, that, consequentialism, is, wrong, as, it, argues, that, all, guilty, individuals, deserve, appropriate, punishment, based, on, the, conviction, that, punishment, should, be, proportional, to, the, crime, and, for, all, the, guilty, however, it, is, sometimes, said, that, retributivism, is, merely, revenge, in, disguise, however, there, are, differences, between, retribution, and, revenge, the, former, is, impartial, and, has, a, scale, of, appropriateness, whereas, the, latter, is, personal, and, potentially, unlimited, in, scale, restorative, justice, attempts, to, repair, the, harm, that, was, done, to, the, victims, it, encourages, active, participation, from, victims, and, encourages, offenders, to, take, responsibility, for, their, actions, restorative, justice, fosters, dialogue, between, victim, and, offender, and, shows, the, highest, rates, of, victim, satisfaction, and, offender, accountability, meta, analyses, of, the, effectivity, of, restorative, justice, show, no, improvement, in, recidivism, some, modern, philosophers, have, said, that, utilitarian, and, retributive, theories, are, not, mutually, exclusive, for, example, andrew, von, hirsch, in, his, 1976, book, doing, justice, suggested, that, we, have, a, moral, obligation, to, punish, greater, crimes, more, than, lesser, ones, however, so, long, as, we, adhere, to, that, constraint, then, utilitarian, ideals, would, play, a, significant, secondary, role, theories, of, distributive, justice, need, to, answer, three, questions, distributive, justice, theorists, generally, do, not, answer, questions, of, who, has, the, right, to, enforce, a, particular, favored, distribution, while, property, rights, theorists, say, that, there, is, no, favored, distribution, rather, distribution, should, be, based, simply, on, whatever, distribution, results, from, lawful, interactions, or, transactions, that, is, transactions, which, are, not, illicit, in, anarchy, state, and, utopia, robert, nozick, said, that, distributive, justice, is, not, a, matter, of, the, whole, distribution, matching, an, ideal, pattern, but, of, each, individual, entitlement, having, the, right, kind, of, history, it, is, just, that, a, person, has, some, good, especially, some, property, right, if, and, only, if, they, came, to, have, it, by, a, history, made, up, entirely, of, events, of, two, kinds, if, the, chain, of, events, leading, up, to, the, person, having, something, meets, this, criterion, they, are, entitled, to, it, that, they, possess, it, is, just, and, what, anyone, else, does, or, does, not, have, or, need, is, irrelevant, on, the, basis, of, this, theory, of, distributive, justice, nozick, said, that, all, attempts, to, redistribute, goods, according, to, an, ideal, pattern, without, the, consent, of, their, owners, are, theft, in, particular, redistributive, taxation, is, theft, some, property, rights, theorists, such, as, nozick, also, take, a, consequentialist, view, of, distributive, justice, and, say, that, property, rights, based, justice, also, has, the, effect, of, maximizing, the, overall, wealth, of, an, economic, system, they, explain, that, voluntary, non, coerced, transactions, always, have, a, property, called, pareto, efficiency, the, result, is, that, the, world, is, better, off, in, an, absolute, sense, and, no, one, is, worse, off, they, say, that, respecting, property, rights, maximizes, the, number, of, pareto, efficient, transactions, in, the, world, and, minimized, the, number, of, non, pareto, efficient, transactions, in, the, world, i, e, transactions, where, someone, is, made, worse, off, the, result, is, that, the, world, will, have, generated, the, greatest, total, benefit, from, the, limited, scarce, resources, available, in, the, world, further, this, will, have, been, accomplished, without, taking, anything, away, from, anyone, unlawfully, equality, before, the, law, is, one, of, the, basic, principles, of, classical, liberalism, classical, liberalism, calls, for, equality, before, the, law, not, for, equality, of, outcome, classical, liberalism, opposes, pursuing, group, rights, at, the, expense, of, individual, rights, in, addition, to, equality, individual, liberty, serves, as, a, core, notion, of, classical, liberalism, as, to, the, liberty, component, british, social, and, political, theorist, philosopher, and, historian, of, ideas, isaiah, berlin, identifies, positive, and, negative, liberty, in, two, concepts, of, liberty, subscribing, to, a, view, of, negative, liberty, in, the, form, of, freedom, from, governmental, interference, he, further, extends, the, concept, of, negative, liberty, in, endorsing, john, stuart, mills, harm, principle, the, sole, end, for, which, mankind, are, warranted, individually, and, collectively, in, interfering, with, the, liberty, of, action, of, any, of, their, number, is, self, protection, which, represents, a, classical, liberal, view, of, liberty, in, political, theory, liberalism, includes, two, traditional, elements, liberty, and, equality, most, contemporary, theories, of, justice, emphasize, the, concept, of, equality, including, rawls, theory, of, justice, as, fairness, for, ronald, dworkin, a, complex, notion, of, equality, is, the, sovereign, political, virtue, dworkin, raises, the, question, of, whether, society, is, under, a, duty, of, justice, to, help, those, responsible, for, the, fact, that, they, need, help, complications, arise, in, distinguishing, matters, of, choice, and, matters, of, chance, as, well, as, justice, for, future, generations, in, the, redistribution, of, resources, that, he, advocates, law, raises, important, and, complex, issues, about, equality, fairness, and, justice, there, is, an, old, saying, that, all, are, equal, before, the, law, the, belief, in, equality, before, the, law, is, called, legal, egalitarianism, in, criticism, of, this, belief, the, author, anatole, france, said, in, 1894, in, its, majestic, equality, the, law, forbids, rich, and, poor, alike, to, sleep, under, bridges, beg, in, the, streets, and, steal, loaves, of, bread, with, this, saying, france, illustrated, the, fundamental, shortcoming, of, a, theory, of, legal, equality, that, remains, blind, to, social, inequality, the, same, law, applied, to, all, may, have, disproportionately, harmful, effects, on, the, least, powerful, according, to, meritocratic, theories, goods, especially, wealth, and, social, status, should, be, distributed, to, match, individual, merit, which, is, usually, understood, as, some, combination, of, talent, and, hard, work, according, to, needs, based, theories, goods, especially, such, basic, goods, as, food, shelter, and, medical, care, should, be, distributed, to, meet, individuals, basic, needs, for, them, according, to, contribution, based, theories, goods, should, be, distributed, to, match, an, individual, s, contribution, to, the, overall, social, good, social, justice, encompasses, the, just, relationship, between, individuals, and, their, society, often, considering, how, privileges, opportunities, and, wealth, ought, to, be, distributed, among, individuals, social, justice, is, also, associated, with, social, mobility, especially, the, ease, with, which, individuals, and, families, may, move, between, social, strata, social, justice, is, distinct, from, cosmopolitanism, which, is, the, idea, that, all, people, belong, to, a, single, global, community, with, a, shared, morality, social, justice, is, also, distinct, from, egalitarianism, which, is, the, idea, that, all, people, are, equal, in, terms, of, status, value, or, rights, as, social, justice, theories, do, not, all, require, equality, for, example, sociologist, george, c, homans, suggested, that, the, root, of, the, concept, of, justice, is, that, each, person, should, receive, rewards, that, are, proportional, to, their, contributions, economist, friedrich, hayek, said, that, the, concept, of, social, justice, was, meaningless, saying, that, justice, is, a, result, of, individual, behavior, and, unpredictable, market, forces, social, justice, is, closely, related, to, the, concept, of, relational, justice, which, is, about, the, just, relationship, with, individuals, who, possess, features, in, common, such, as, nationality, or, who, are, engaged, in, cooperation, or, negotiation, in, legal, theory, equity, is, seen, as, the, concept, connecting, law, to, justice, since, law, cannot, be, applied, without, reference, to, justice, in, that, context, justice, is, seen, as, the, rationale, and, the, ethical, foundation, of, equity, one, approach, towards, equity, in, justice, is, community, policing, marxism, is, a, needs, based, theory, expressed, succinctly, in, marx, s, slogan, from, each, according, to, his, ability, to, each, according, to, his, need, relational, justice, examines, individual, connections, and, societal, relationships, focusing, on, normative, and, political, aspects, rawls, theory, of, justice, aims, to, distribute, social, goods, to, benefit, the, poor, but, does, not, consider, power, relations, political, structures, or, social, meanings, even, rawls, self, respect, is, not, compatible, with, distribution, iris, marion, young, charges, that, distributive, accounts, of, justice, fail, to, provide, an, adequate, way, of, conceptualizing, political, justice, in, that, they, fail, to, take, into, account, many, of, the, demands, of, ordinary, life, and, that, a, relational, view, of, justice, grounded, upon, understanding, the, differences, among, social, groups, offers, a, better, approach, one, which, acknowledges, unjust, power, relations, among, individuals, groups, and, institutional, structures, young, kim, also, takes, a, relational, approach, to, the, question, of, justice, but, departs, from, iris, marion, young, s, political, advocacy, of, group, rights, and, instead, he, emphasizes, the, individual, and, moral, aspects, of, justice, as, to, its, moral, aspects, he, said, that, justice, includes, responsible, actions, based, on, rational, and, autonomous, moral, agency, with, the, individual, as, the, proper, bearer, of, rights, and, responsibilities, politically, he, maintains, that, the, proper, context, for, justice, is, a, form, of, liberalism, with, the, traditional, elements, of, liberty, and, equality, together, with, the, concepts, of, diversity, and, tolerance, the, phrase, justice, delayed, is, justice, denied, refers, to, the, problem, of, slow, justice, the, right, to, speedy, trial, is, in, some, jurisdictions, enshrined, higher, quality, justice, tends, to, be, speedy, in, criminal, law, a, sentence, forms, the, final, explicit, act, of, a, judge, ruled, process, and, also, the, symbolic, principal, act, connected, to, his, function, the, sentence, can, generally, involve, a, decree, of, imprisonment, a, fine, and, or, other, punishments, against, a, defendant, convicted, of,
