was, shaped, much, in, its, formative, years, by, the, log, college, a, seminary, founded, by, the, reverend, william, tennent, at, neshaminy, pennsylvania, in, about, 1726, while, no, legal, connection, ever, existed, many, of, the, pupils, and, adherents, from, the, log, college, would, go, on, to, financially, support, and, become, substantially, involved, in, the, early, years, of, the, university, while, early, writers, considered, it, as, the, predecessor, of, the, university, the, idea, has, been, rebuked, by, princeton, historians, the, founding, of, the, university, itself, originated, from, a, split, in, the, presbyterian, church, following, the, great, awakening, in, 1741, new, light, presbyterians, were, expelled, from, the, synod, of, philadelphia, in, defense, of, how, the, log, college, ordained, ministers, the, four, founders, of, the, college, of, new, jersey, who, were, new, lights, were, either, expelled, or, withdrew, from, the, synod, and, devised, a, plan, to, establish, a, new, college, for, they, were, disappointed, with, harvard, and, yale, s, opposition, to, the, great, awakening, and, dissatisfied, with, the, limited, instruction, at, the, log, college, they, convinced, three, other, presbyterians, to, join, them, and, decided, on, new, jersey, as, the, location, for, the, college, as, at, the, time, there, was, no, institution, between, yale, college, in, new, haven, connecticut, and, the, college, of, william, mary, in, williamsburg, virginia, it, was, also, where, some, of, the, founders, preached, although, their, initial, request, was, rejected, by, the, anglican, governor, lewis, morrison, the, acting, governor, after, morrison, s, death, john, hamilton, granted, a, charter, for, the, college, of, new, jersey, on, october, 22, 1746, in, 1747, approximately, five, months, after, acquiring, the, charter, the, trustees, elected, jonathan, dickinson, as, president, and, opened, in, elizabeth, new, jersey, where, classes, were, held, in, dickinson, s, parsonage, with, its, founding, it, became, the, fourth, oldest, institution, of, higher, education, in, the, united, states, and, one, of, nine, colonial, colleges, chartered, before, the, american, revolution, the, founders, aimed, for, the, college, to, have, an, expansive, curriculum, to, teach, people, of, various, professions, not, solely, ministerial, work, though, the, school, was, open, to, those, of, any, religious, denomination, with, many, of, the, founders, being, of, presbyterian, faith, the, college, became, the, educational, and, religious, capital, of, scotch, irish, presbyterian, america, in, 1747, following, the, death, of, then, president, jonathan, dickinson, the, college, moved, from, elizabeth, to,

but, on, september, 14, 1748, the, recently, appointed, governor, jonathan, belcher, granted, a, second, charter, belcher, a, congregationalist, had, become, alienated, from, his, alma, mater, harvard, and, decided, to, adopt, the, infant, college, belcher, would, go, on, to, raise, funds, for, the, college, and, donate, his, 474, volume, library, making, it, one, of, the, largest, libraries, in, the, colonies, in, 1756, the, college, moved, again, to, its, present, home, in, princeton, new, jersey, because, newark, was, felt, to, be, too, close, to, new, york, princeton, was, chosen, for, its, location, in, central, new, jersey, and, by, strong, recommendation, by, belcher, the, college, s, home, in, princeton, was, nassau, hall, named, for, the, royal, william, iii, of, england, a, member, of, the, house, of, orange, nassau, the, trustees, of, the, college, of, new, jersey, initially, suggested, that, nassau, hall, be, named, in, recognition, of, belcher, because, of, his, interest, in, the, institution, the, governor, vetoed, the, request, burr, who, would, die, in, 1757, devised, a, curriculum, for, the, school, and, enlarged, the, student, body, following, the, untimely, death, of, burr, and, the, college, s, next, three, presidents, john, witherspoon, became, president, in, 1768, and, remained, in, that, post, until, his, death, in, 1794, with, his,

college, raised, funds, for, reconstruction, as, well, as, the, construction, of, two, new, buildings, in, 1807, a, large, student, riot, occurred, at, nassau, hall, spurred, by, underlying, distrust, of, educational, reforms, by, smith, away, from, the, church, following, smith, s, mishandling, of, the, situation, falling, enrollment, and, faculty, resignations, the, trustees, of, the, university, offered, resignation, to, smith, which, he, accepted, in, 1812, ashbel, green, was, unanimously, elected, by, the, trustees, of, the, college, to, become, the, eighth, president, after, the, liberal, tenure, of, smith, green, represented, the, conservative, old, side, in, which, he, introduced, rigorous, disciplinary, rules, and, heavily, embraced, religion, even, so, believing, the, college, was, not, religious, enough, he, took, a, prominent, role, in, establishing, the, princeton, theological, seminary, next, door, while, student, riots, were, a, frequent, occurrence, during, green, s, tenure, enrollment, did, increase, under, his, administration, in, 1823, james, carnahan, became, president, arriving, as, an, unprepared, and, timid, leader, with, the, college, riven, by, conflicting, views, between, students, faculty, and, trustees, and, enrollment, hitting, its, lowest, in, years, carnahan, considered, closing, the, university, carnahan, s, successor, john, maclean, jr, who, was, only, a, professor, at, the, time, recommended, saving, the, university, with, the, help, of, alumni, as, a, result, princeton, s, alumni, association, led, by, james, madison, was, created, and, began, raising, funds, with, carnahan, and, maclean, now, vice, president, working, as, partners, enrollment, and, faculty, increased, tensions, decreased, and, the, college, campus, expanded, maclean, took, over, the, presidency, in, 1854, and, led, the, university, through, the, american, civil, war, when, nassau, hall, burned, down, again, in, 1855, maclean, raised, funds, and, used, the, money, to, rebuild, nassau, hall, and, run, the, university, on, an, austerity, budget, during, the, war, years, with, a, third, of, students, from, the, college, being, from, the, south,

became, the, college, s, president, in, 1868, and, lifted, the, institution, out, of, a, low, period, that, had, been, brought, about, by, the, war, during, his, two, decades, of, service, he, overhauled, the, curriculum, oversaw, an, expansion, of, inquiry, into, the, sciences, recruited, distinguished, faculty, and, supervised, the, addition, of, a, number, of, buildings, in, the, high, victorian, gothic, style, to, the, campus, mccosh, s, tenure, also, saw, the, creation, and, rise, of, many, extracurricular, activities, like, the, princeton, glee, club, the, triangle, club, the,

doctorates, on, james, f, williamson, and, william, libby, both, members, of, the, class, of, 1877, francis, patton, took, the, presidency, in, 1888, and, although, his, election, was, not, met, by, unanimous, enthusiasm, he, was, well, received, by, undergraduates, patton, s, administration, was, marked, by, great, change, for, princeton, s, enrollment, and, faculty, had, doubled, at, the, same, time, the, college, underwent, large, expansion, and, social, life, was, changing, in, reflection, of, the, rise, in, eating, clubs, and, burgeoning, interest, in, athletics, in, 1893, the, honor, system, was, established, allowing, for, unproctored, exams, in, 1896, the, college, officially, became, a, university, and, as, a, result, it, officially, changed, its, name, to, princeton, university, in, 1900, the, graduate, school, was, formally, established, even, with, such, accomplishments, patton, s, administration, remained, lackluster, with, its, administrative, structure, and, towards, its, educational, standards, due, to, profile, changes, in, the, board, of, trustees, and, dissatisfaction, with, his, administration, he, was, forced, to, resign, in, 1902, following, patton, s, resignation, woodrow, wilson, an, alumnus, and, popular, professor, was, elected, the, 13th, president, of, the, university, noticing, falling, academic, standards, wilson, orchestrated, significant, changes, to, the, curriculum, where, freshman, and, sophomores, followed, a, unified, curriculum, while, juniors, and, seniors, concentrated, study, in, one, discipline, ambitious, seniors, were, allowed, to, undertake, independent, work, which, would, eventually, shape, princeton, s, emphasis, on, the, practice, for, the, future, wilson, further, reformed, the, educational, system, by, introducing, the, preceptorial, system, in, 1905, a, then, unique, concept, in, the, united, states, that, augmented, the, standard, lecture, method, of, teaching, with, a, more, personal, form, in, which, small, groups, of, students, or, precepts, could, interact, with, a, single, instructor, or, preceptor, in, their, field, of, interest, the, changes, brought, about, many, new, faculty, and, cemented, princeton, s, academics, for, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, due, to, the, tightening, of, academic, standards, enrollment, declined, severely, until, 1907, in, 1906, the, reservoir, lake, carnegie, was, created, by, andrew, carnegie, and, the, university, officially, became, nonsectarian, before, leaving, office, wilson, strengthened, the, science, program, to, focus, on, pure, research, and, broke, the, presbyterian, lock, on, the, board, of, trustees, however, he, did, fail, in, winning, support, for, the, permanent, location, of, the, graduate, school, and, the, elimination, of, the, eating, clubs, which, he, proposed, replacing, with, quadrangles, a, precursor, to, the, residential, college, system, wilson, also, continued, to, keep, princeton, closed, off, from, accepting, black, students, when, an, aspiring, black, student, wrote, a, letter, to, wilson, he, got, his, secretary, to, reply, telling, him, to, attend, a, university, where, he, would, be, more, welcome, john, grier, hibben, became, president, in, 1912, and, would, remain, in, the, post, for, two, decades, on, october, 2, 1913, the, princeton, university, graduate, college, was, dedicated, when, the, united, states, entered, world, war, i, in, 1917, hibben, allocated, all, available, university, resources, to, the, government, as, a, result, military, training, schools, opened, on, campus, and, laboratories, and, other, facilities, were, used, for, research, and, operational, programs, overall, more, than, 6, 000, students, served, in, the, armed, forces, with, 151, dying, during, the, war, after, the, war, enrollment, spiked, and, the, trustees, established, the, system, of, selective, admission, in, 1922, from, the, 1920s, to, the, 1930s, the, student, body, featured, many, students, from, preparatory, schools, zero, black, students, and, dwindling, jewish, enrollment, because, of, quotas, aside, from, managing, princeton, during, wwi, hibben, introduced, the, senior, thesis, in, 1923, as, a, part, of, the, new, plan, of, study, he, also, brought, about, great, expansion, to, the, university, with, the, creation, of, the, school, of, architecture, in, 1919, the, school, of, engineering, in, 1921, and, the, school, of, public, and, international, affairs, in, 1930, by, the, end, of, his, presidency, the, endowment, had,

reasons, at, the, same, time, princeton, s, reputation, in, physics, and, mathematics, surged, as, many, european, scientists, left, for, the, united, states, due, to, uneasy, tension, caused, by, nazi, germany, in, 1930, the, institute, for, advanced, study, was, founded, to, provide, a, space, for, the, influx, of, scientists, such, as, albert, einstein, many, princeton, scientists, would, work, on, the, manhattan, project, during, the, war, including, the, entire, physics, department, during, world, war, ii, princeton, offered, an, accelerated, program, for, students, to, graduate, early, before, entering, the, armed, forces, student, enrollment, fluctuated, from, month, to, month, and, many, faculty, were, forced, to, teach, unfamiliar, subjects, still, dodds, maintained, academic, standards, and, would, establish, a, program, for, servicemen, so, they, could, resume, their, education, once, discharged, the, post, war, years, saw, scholars, renewing, broken, bonds, through, numerous, conventions, expansion, of, the, campus, and, the, introduction, of, distribution, requirements, the, period, saw, the, desegregation, of, princeton, which, was, stimulated, by, changes, to, the, new, jersey, constitution, princeton, began, undertaking, a, sharper, focus, towards, research, in, the, years, after, the, war, with, the, construction, of, firestone, library, in, 1948, and, the, establishment, of, the, forrestal, research, center, in, the, 1950s, government, sponsored, research, increased, sharply, particularly, in, the, physics, and, engineering, departments, with, much, of, it, occurring, at, the, new, forrestal, campus, though, as, the, years, progressed, scientific, research, at, the, forrestal, campus, declined, and, in, 1973, some, of, the, land, was, converted, to, commercial, and, residential, spaces, robert, goheen, would, succeed, dodds, by, unanimous, vote, and, serve, as, president, until, 1972, goheen, s, presidency, was, characterized, as, being, more, liberal, than, previous, presidents, and, his, presidency, would, see, a, rise, in, black, applicants, as, well, as, the, eventual, coeducation, of, the, university, in, 1969, during, this, period, of, rising, diversity, the, third, world, center, now, known, as, the, carl, a, fields, center, was, dedicated, in, 1971, goheen, also, oversaw, great, expansion, for, the, university, with, square, footage, increasing, by, 80, percentage, throughout, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, princeton, experienced, unprecedented, activism, with, most, of, it, centered, on, the, vietnam, war, while, princeton, activism, initially, remained, relatively, timid, compared, to, other, institutions, protests, began, to, grow, with, the, founding, of, a, local, chapter, of, students, for, a, democratic, society, sds, in, 1965, which, organized, many, of, the, later, princeton, protests, in, 1966, the, sds, gained, prominence, on, campus, following, picketing, against, a, speech, by, president, lyndon, b, johnson, which, gained, frontpage, coverage, by, the, new, york, times, a, notable, point, of, contention, on, campus, was, the, institute, for, defense, analyses, ida, and, would, feature, multiple, protests, some, of, which, required, police, action, in, 1967, sds, members, and, sympathizers, beat, the, campus, r, o, t, c, chapter, in, a, game, of, touch, football, as, the, years, went, on, the, protests, agenda, broadened, to, investments, in, south, africa, environmental, issues, and, women, s, rights, in, response, to, these, broadening, protests, the, council, of, the, princeton, university, community, cpuc, was, founded, to, serve, as, a, method, for, greater, student, voice, in, governance, activism, culminated, in, 1970, with, a, student, faculty, and, staff, member, strike, so, the, university, could, become, an, institution, against, expansion, of, the, war, princeton, s, protests, would, taper, off, later, that, year, with, the, daily, princetonian,
