competition, is, a, rivalry, where, two, or, more, parties, strive, for, a, common, goal, which, cannot, be, shared, where, one, s, gain, is, the, other, s, loss, an, example, of, which, is, a, zero, sum, game, competition, can, arise, between, entities, such, as, organisms, individuals, economic, and, social, groups, etc, the, rivalry, can, be, over, attainment, of, any, exclusive, goal, including, recognition, competition, occurs, in, nature, between, living, organisms, which, co, exist, in, the, same, environment, animals, compete, over, water, supplies, food, mates, and, other, biological, resources, humans, usually, compete, for, food, and, mates, though, when, these, needs, are, met, deep, rivalries, often, arise, over, the, pursuit, of, wealth, power, prestige, and, fame, when, in, a, static, repetitive, or, unchanging, environment, competition, is, a, major, tenet, of, market, economies, and, business, often, associated, with, business, competition, as, companies, are, in, competition, with, at, least, one, other, firm, over, the, same, group, of, customers, competition, inside, a, company, is, usually, stimulated, with, the, larger, purpose, of, meeting, and, reaching, higher, quality, of, services, or, improved, products, that, the, company, may, produce, or, develop, competition, is, often, considered, to, be, the, opposite, of, cooperation, however, in, the, real, world, mixtures, of, cooperation, and, competition, are, the, norm, in, economies, as, the, philosopher, r, g, collingwood, argued, the, presence, of, these, two, opposites, together, is, essential, to, an, economic, system, the, parties, to, an, economic, action, co, operate, in, competing, like, two, chess, players, optimal, strategies, to, achieve, goals, are, studied, in, the, branch, of, mathematics, known, as, game, theory, competition, has, been, studied, in, several, fields, including, psychology, sociology, and, anthropology, social, psychologists, for, instance, study, the, nature, of, competition, they, investigate, the, natural, urge, of, competition, and, its, circumstances, they, also, study, group, dynamics, to, detect, how, competition, emerges, and, what, its, effects, are, sociologists, meanwhile, study, the, effects, of, competition, on, society, as, a, whole, additionally, anthropologists, study, the, history, and, prehistory, of, competition, in, various, cultures, they, also, investigate, how, competition, manifested, itself, in, various, cultural, settings, in, the, past, and, how, competition, has, developed, over, time, competition, within, between, and, among, species, is, one, of, the, most, important, forces, in, biology, especially, in, the, field, of, ecology, competition, between, members, of, a, species, intraspecific, for, resources, such, as, food, water, territory, and, sunlight, may, result, in, an, increase, in, the, frequency, of, a, variant, of, the, species, best, suited, for, survival, and, reproduction, until, its, fixation, within, a, population, however, competition, among, resources, also, has, a, strong, tendency, for, diversification, between, members, of, the, same, species, resulting, in, coexistence, of, competitive, and, non, competitive, strategies, or, cycles, between, low, and, high, competitiveness, third, parties, within, a, species, often, favour, highly, competitive, strategies, leading, to, species, extinction, when, environmental, conditions, are, harsh, evolutionary, suicide, competition, is, also, present, between, species, interspecific, when, resources, are, limited, several, species, may, depend, on, these, resources, thus, each, of, the, species, competes, with, the, others, to, gain, access, to, the, resources, as, a, result, species, less, suited, to, compete, for, the, resources, may, die, out, unless, they, adapt, by, character, dislocation, for, instance, according, to, evolutionary, theory, this, competition, within, and, between, species, for, resources, plays, a, significant, role, in, natural, selection, at, shorter, time, scales, competition, is, also, one, of, the, most, important, factors, controlling, diversity, in, ecological, communities, but, at, larger, scales, expansion, and, contraction, of, ecological, space, is, a, much, larger, factor, than, competition, this, is, illustrated, by, living, plant, communities, where, asymmetric, competition, and, competitive, dominance, frequently, occur, multiple, examples, of, symmetric, and, asymmetric, competition, also, exist, for, animals, in, australia, new, zealand, and, the, united, kingdom, competitions, or, lotto, are, the, equivalent, of, what, are, commonly, known, as, sweepstakes, in, the, united, states, the, correct, technical, name, for, australian, consumer, competitions, is, a, trade, promotion, lottery, or, lotto, competition, or, trade, promotion, lottery, entrants, enter, to, win, a, prize, or, prizes, hence, many, entrants, are, all, in, competition, or, competing, for, a, limited, number, of, prizes, a, trade, promotion, lottery, or, competition, is, a, free, entry, lottery, run, to, promote, goods, or, services, supplied, by, a, business, an, example, is, where, you, purchase, goods, or, services, and, then, given, the, chance, to, enter, into, the, lottery, and, possibly, win, a, prize, a, trade, promotion, lottery, can, be, called, a, lotto, competition, contest, sweepstake, or, giveaway, such, competitions, can, be, games, of, luck, randomly, drawn, or, skill, judged, on, an, entry, question, or, submission, or, possibly, a, combination, of, both, people, that, enjoy, entering, competitions, are, known, as, compers, many, philosophers, and, psychologists, have, identified, a, trait, in, most, living, organisms, which, can, drive, the, particular, organism, to, compete, this, trait, called, competitiveness, is, viewed, as, having, a, high, adaptive, value, which, coexists, along, with, the, urge, for, survival, competitiveness, or, the, inclination, to, compete, though, has, become, synonymous, with, aggressiveness, and, ambition, in, the, english, language, more, advanced, civilizations, integrate, aggressiveness, and, competitiveness, into, their, interactions, as, a, way, to, distribute, resources, and, adapt, many, plants, compete, with, neighboring, ones, for, sunlight, the, term, also, applies, to, econometrics, here, it, is, a, comparative, measure, of, the, ability, and, performance, of, a, firm, or, sub, sector, to, sell, and, produce, supply, goods, and, or, services, in, a, given, market, the, two, academic, bodies, of, thought, on, the, assessment, of, competitiveness, are, the, structure, conduct, performance, paradigm, and, the, more, contemporary, new, empirical, industrial, organisation, model, predicting, changes, in, the, competitiveness, of, business, sectors, is, becoming, an, integral, and, explicit, step, in, public, policymaking, within, capitalist, economic, systems, the, drive, of, enterprises, is, to, maintain, and, improve, their, own, competitiveness, competition, is, a, major, factor, in, education, on, a, global, scale, national, education, systems, intending, to, bring, out, the, best, in, the, next, generation, encourage, competitiveness, among, students, through, scholarships, countries, such, as, england, and, singapore, have, special, education, programmes, which, cater, for, specialist, students, prompting, charges, of, academic, elitism, upon, receipt, of, their, academic, results, students, tend, to, compare, their, grades, to, see, who, is, better, in, severe, cases, the, pressure, to, perform, in, some, countries, is, so, high, that, it, can, result, in, stigmatization, of, intellectually, deficient, students, or, even, suicide, as, a, consequence, of, failing, the, exams, critics, of, competition, as, a, motivating, factor, in, education, systems, such, as, alfie, kohn, assert, that, competition, actually, has, a, net, negative, influence, on, the, achievement, levels, of, students, and, that, it, turns, all, of, us, into, losers, economist, richard, layard, has, commented, on, the, harmful, effects, stating, people, feel, that, they, are, under, a, great, deal, of, pressure, they, feel, that, their, main, objective, in, life, is, to, do, better, than, other, people, that, is, certainly, what, young, people, are, being, taught, in, school, every, day, and, it, s, not, a, good, basis, for, a, society, however, other, studies, such, as, the, torrance, tests, of, creative, thinking, show, that, the, effect, of, competition, on, students, depends, on, each, individual, s, level, of, agency, students, with, a, high, level, of, agency, thrive, on, competition, are, self, motivated, and, are, willing, to, risk, failure, compared, to, their, counterparts, who, are, low, in, agency, these, students, are, more, likely, to, be, flexible, adaptable, and, creative, as, adults, merriam, webster, gives, as, one, definition, of, competition, relating, to, business, as, rivalry, such, as, the, effort, of, two, or, more, parties, acting, independently, to, secure, the, business, of, a, third, party, by, offering, the, most, favorable, terms, adam, smith, in, his, 1776, book, the, wealth, of, nations, and, later, economists, described, competition, in, general, as, allocating, productive, resources, to, their, most, highly, valued, uses, and, encouraging, efficiency, later, microeconomic, theory, distinguished, between, perfect, competition, and, imperfect, competition, concluding, that, no, system, of, resource, allocation, is, more, efficient, than, perfect, competition, competition, according, to, the, theory, causes, commercial, firms, to, develop, new, products, services, and, technologies, which, would, give, consumers, greater, selection, and, better, products, the, greater, selection, typically, causes, lower, prices, for, the, products, compared, to, what, the, price, would, be, if, there, was, no, competition, monopoly, or, little, competition, oligopoly, however, competition, may, also, lead, to, wasted, duplicated, effort, and, to, increased, costs, and, prices, in, some, circumstances, for, example, the, intense, competition, for, the, small, number, of, top, jobs, in, music, and, movie, acting, leads, many, aspiring, musicians, and, actors, to, make, substantial, investments, in, training, which, are, not, recouped, because, only, a, fraction, become, successful, critics, have, also, argued, that, competition, can, be, destabilizing, particularly, competition, between, certain, financial, institutions, experts, have, also, questioned, the, constructiveness, of, competition, in, profitability, it, has, been, argued, that, competition, oriented, objectives, are, counterproductive, to, raising, revenues, and, profitability, because, they, limit, the, options, of, strategies, for, firms, as, well, as, their, ability, to, offer, innovative, responses, to, changes, in, the, market, in, addition, the, strong, desire, to, defeat, rival, firms, with, competitive, prices, has, the, strong, possibility, of, causing, price, wars, another, distinction, appearing, in, economics, is, that, between, competition, as, an, end, state, as, in, the, case, of, both, perfect, and, imperfect, competition, and, competition, as, a, process, it, is, a, process, of, rivalry, between, firms, or, consumers, intensifying, selective, pressures, for, improvements, one, can, restate, this, as, a, process, of, discovery, three, levels, of, end, state, economic, competition, have, been, classified, in, addition, companies, compete, for, financing, on, the, capital, markets, equity, or, debt, in, order, to, generate, the, necessary, cash, for, their, operations, investor, typically, consider, alternative, investment, opportunities, given, their, risk, profile, and, not, only, look, at, companies, just, competing, on, product, direct, competitors, enlarging, the, investment, universe, to, include, indirect, competitors, leads, to, a, broader, peer, universe, of, comparable, indirectly, competing, companies, competition, does, not, necessarily, have, to, be, between, companies, for, example, business, writers, sometimes, refer, to, internal, competition, this, is, competition, within, companies, the, idea, was, first, introduced, by, alfred, sloan, at, general, motors, in, the, 1920s, sloan, deliberately, created, areas, of, overlap, between, divisions, of, the, company, so, that, each, division, would, compete, with, the, other, divisions, for, example, the, chevrolet, division, would, compete, with, the, pontiac, division, for, some, market, segments, the, competing, brands, by, the, same, company, allowed, parts, to, be, designed, by, one, division, and, shared, by, several, divisions, for, example, parts, designed, by, chevrolet, would, also, be, used, by, pontiac, in, 1931, procter, gamble, initiated, a, deliberate, system, of, internal, brand, versus, brand, rivalry, the, company, was, organized, around, different, brands, with, each, brand, allocated, resources, including, a, dedicated, group, of, employees, willing, to, champion, the, brand, each, brand, manager, was, given, responsibility, for, the, success, or, failure, of, the, brand, and, compensated, accordingly, most, businesses, also, encourage, competition, between, individual, employees, an, example, of, this, is, a, contest, between, sales, representatives, the, sales, representative, with, the, highest, sales, or, the, best, improvement, in, sales, over, a, period, of, time, would, gain, benefits, from, the, employer, this, is, also, known, as, intra, brand, competition, shalev, and, asbjornsen, found, that, success, i, e, the, saving, resulted, of, reverse, auctions, correlated, most, closely, with, competition, the, literature, widely, supported, the, importance, of, competition, as, the, primary, driver, of, reverse, auctions, success, their, findings, appear, to, support, that, argument, as, competition, correlated, strongly, with, the, reverse, auction, success, as, well, as, with, the, number, of, bidders, business, and, economic, competition, in, most, countries, is, often, limited, or, restricted, competition, often, is, subject, to, legal, restrictions, for, example, competition, may, be, legally, prohibited, as, in, the, cases, of, a, government, monopoly, or, of, a, government, granted, monopoly, governments, may, institute, tariffs, subsidies, or, other, protectionist, measures, in, order, to, prevent, or, reduce, competition, depending, on, the, respective, economic, policy, pure, competition, is, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, regulated, by, competition, policy, and, competition, law, another, component, of, these, activities, is, the, discovery, process, with, instances, of, higher, government, regulations, typically, leading, to, less, competitive, businesses, being, launched, nicholas, gruen, has, referred, to, the, competition, delusion, in, which, competition, is, taken, to, be, unambiguously, good, even, where, that, competition, leaks, into, the, rules, of, the, game, he, claims, this, drives, financialisation, the, approximate, doubling, of, proportion, of, economic, resources, dedicated, to, finance, and, to, rule, making, and, administering, professions, such, as, law, accountancy, and, auditing, competition, between, countries, is, quite, subtle, to, detect, but, is, quite, evident, in, the, world, economy, countries, compete, to, provide, the, best, possible, business, environment, for, multinational, corporations, such, competition, is, evident, by, the, policies, undertaken, by, these, countries, to, educate, the, future, workforce, for, example, east, asian, economies, such, as, singapore, japan, and, south, korea, tend, to, compete, by, allocating, a, large, portion, of, the, budget, to, the, education, sector, including, by, implementing, programmes, such, as, gifted, education, competition, law, known, in, the, united, states, as, antitrust, law, has, three, main, functions, in, all, three, cases, competition, law, aims, to, protect, the, welfare, of, consumers, by, ensuring, that, each, business, must, compete, for, its, share, of, the, market, economy, in, recent, decades, competition, law, has, also, been, sold, as, good, medicine, to, provide, better, public, services, traditionally, funded, by, tax, payers, and, administered, by, democratically, accountable, governments, hence, competition, law, is, closely, connected, with, the, law, on, deregulation, of, access, to, markets, providing, state, aids, and, subsidies, the, privatisation, of, state, owned, assets, and, the, use, of, independent, sector, regulators, such, as, the, united, kingdom, telecommunications, watchdog, ofcom, behind, the, practice, lies, the, theory, which, over, the, last, fifty, years, has, been, dominated, by, neo, classical, economics, markets, are, seen, as, the, most, efficient, method, of, allocating, resources, although, sometimes, they, fail, and, regulation, becomes, necessary, to, protect, the, ideal, market, model, behind, the, theory, lies, the, history, reaching, back, further, than, the, roman, empire, the, business, practices, of, market, traders, guilds, and, governments, have, always, been, subject, to, scrutiny, and, sometimes, to, severe, sanctions, since, the, twentieth, century, competition, law, has, become, global, the, two, largest, most, organised, and, influential, systems, of, competition, regulation, are, united, states, antitrust, law, and, european, community, competition, law, the, respective, national, international, authorities, the, u, s, department, of, justice, doj, and, the, federal, trade, commission, ftc, in, the, united, states, and, the, european, commission, s, competition, directorate, general, dgcomp, have, formed, international, support, and, enforcement, networks, competition, law, is, growing, in, importance, every, day, which, warrants, for, its, careful, study, game, theory, is, the, study, of, mathematical, models, of, conflict, and, cooperation, between, intelligent, rational, decision, makers, game, theory, is, mainly, used, in, economics, political, science, and, psychology, as, well, as, logic, computer, science, biology, and, poker, originally, it, mainly, addressed, zero, sum, games, in, which, one, person, s, gains, result, in, losses, for, the, other, participants, game, theory, is, a, major, method, used, in, mathematical, economics, and, business, for, modeling, competing, behaviors, of, interacting, agents, applications, include, a, wide, array, of, economic, phenomena, and, approaches, such, as, auctions, bargaining, mergers, acquisitions, pricing, fair, division, duopolies, oligopolies, social, network, formation, agent, based, computational, economics, general, equilibrium, mechanism, design, and, voting, systems, and, across, such, broad, areas, as, experimental, economics, behavioral, economics, information, economics, industrial, organization, and, political, economy, this, research, usually, focuses, on, particular, sets, of, strategies, known, as, solution, concepts, or, equilibria, a, common, assumption, is, that, players, act, rationally, in, non, cooperative, games, the, most, famous, of, these, is, the, nash, equilibrium, a, set, of, strategies, is, a, nash, equilibrium, if, each, represents, a, best, response, to, the, other, strategies, if, all, the, players, are, playing, the, strategies, in, a, nash, equilibrium, they, have, no, unilateral, incentive, to, deviate, since, their, strategy, is, the, best, they, can, do, given, what, others, are, doing, literary, competitions, such, as, contests, sponsored, by, literary, journals, publishing, houses, and, theaters, have, increasingly, become, a, means, for, aspiring, writers, to, gain, recognition, awards, for, fiction, include, those, sponsored, by, the, missouri, review, boston, review, indiana, review, north, american, review, and, southwest, review, the, albee, award, sponsored, by, the, yale, drama, series, is, among, the, most, prestigious, playwriting, awards, margaret, heffernan, s, study, a, bigger, prize, examines, the, perils, and, disadvantages, of, competition, in, for, example, biology, families, sport, education, commerce, and, the, soviet, union, karl, marx, insisted, that, the, capitalist, system, fosters, competition, and, egoism, in, all, its, members, and, thoroughly, undermines, all, genuine, forms, of, community, it, promotes, a, climate, of, competitive, egoism, and, individualism, with, competition, for, jobs, and, competition, between, employees, marx, said, competition, between, workers, exceeds, that, demonstrated, by, company, owners, he, also, points, out, that, competition, separates, individuals, from, one, another, and, while, concentration, of, workers, and, development, of, better, communication, alleviate, this, they, are, not, a, decision, sigmund, freud, explained, competition, as, a, primal, dilemma, in, which, all, infants, find, themselves, the, infant, competes, with, other, family, members, for, the, attention, and, affection, of, the, parent, of, the, opposite, sex, or, the, primary, caregiving, parent, during, this, time, a, boy, develops, a, deep, fear, that, the, father, the, son, s, prime, rival, will, punish, him, for, these, feelings, of, desire, for, the, mother, by, castrating, him, girls, develop, penis, envy, towards, all, males, the, girl, s, envy, is, rooted, in, the, biologic, fact, that, without, a, penis, she, cannot, sexually, possess, mother, as, the, infantile, id, demands, resultantly, the, girl, redirects, her, desire, for, sexual, union, upon, father, in, competitive, rivalry, with, her, mother, this, constellation, of, feelings, is, known, as, oedipus, complex, after, the, greek, mythology, figure, who, accidentally, killed, his, father, and, married, his, mother, this, is, associated, with, the, phallic, stage, of, childhood, development, where, intense, primal, emotions, of, competitive, rivalry, with, usually, the, parent, of, the, same, sex, are, rampant, and, create, a, crisis, that, must, be, negotiated, successfully, for, healthy, psychological, development, to, proceed, unresolved, oedipus, complex, competitiveness, issues, can, lead, to, lifelong, neuroses, manifesting, in, various, ways, related, to, an, overdetermined, relationship, to, competition, gandhi, speaks, of, egoistic, competition, for, him, such, qualities, glorified, and, or, left, unbridled, can, lead, to, violence, conflict, discord, and, destructiveness, for, gandhi, competition, comes, from, the, ego, and, therefore, society, must, be, based, on, mutual, love, cooperation, and, sacrifice, for, the, well, being, of, humanity, in, the, society, desired, by, gandhi, each, individual, will, cooperate, and, serve, for, the, welfare, of, others, and, people, will, share, each, other, s, joys, sorrows, and, achievements, as, a, norm, of, a, social, life, for, him, in, a, non, violent, society, competition, does, not, have, a, place, and, this, should, become, realized, with, more, people, making, the, personal, choice, to, have, fewer, tendencies, toward, egoism, and, selfishness, competition, is, also, found, in, politics, in, democracies, a, free, and, fair, election, is, an, electoral, competition, for, an, elected, office, in, other, words, two, or, more, candidates, strive, and, compete, against, one, another, to, attain, a, position, of, power, the, winner, gains, the, seat, of, the, elected, office, for, a, predefined, period, of, time, towards, the, end, of, which, another, election, is, usually, held, to, determine, the, next, holder, of, the, office, in, addition, there, is, inevitable, competition, inside, a, government, because, several, offices, are, appointed, potential, candidates, compete, against, the, others, in, order, to, gain, the, particular, office, departments, may, also, compete, for, a, limited, amount, of, resources, such, as, for, funding, finally, where, there, are, party, systems, elected, leaders, of, different, parties, will, ultimately, compete, against, the, other, parties, for, laws, funding, and, power, finally, competition, also, exists, between, governments, each, country, or, nationality, struggles, for, world, dominance, power, or, military, strength, for, example, the, united, states, competed, against, the, soviet, union, in, the, cold, war, for, world, power, and, the, two, also, struggled, over, the, different, types, of, government, in, these, cases, representative, democracy, and, communism, the, result, of, this, type, of, competition, often, leads, to, worldwide, tensions, and, may, sometimes, erupt, into, warfare, while, some, sports, and, games, such, as, fishing, or, hiking, have, been, viewed, as, primarily, recreational, most, sports, are, considered, competitive, the, majority, involve, competition, between, two, or, more, persons, sometimes, using, horses, or, cars, for, example, in, a, game, of, basketball, two, teams, compete, against, one, another, to, determine, who, can, score, the, most, points, when, there, is, no, set, reward, for, the, winning, team, many, players, gain, a, sense, of, pride, in, addition, extrinsic, rewards, may, also, be, given, athletes, besides, competing, against, other, humans, also, compete, against, nature, in, sports, such, as, whitewater, kayaking, or, mountaineering, where, the, goal, is, to, reach, a, destination, with, only, natural, barriers, impeding, the, process, a, regularly, scheduled, for, instance, annual, competition, meant, to, determine, the, best, competitor, of, that, cycle, is, called, a, championship, competitive, sports, are, governed, by, codified, rules, agreed, upon, by, the, participants, violating, these, rules, is, considered, to, be, unfair, competition, thus, sports, provide, artificial, not, natural, competition, for, example, competing, for, control, of, a, ball, or, defending, territory, on, a, playing, field, is, not, an, innate, biological, factor, in, humans, athletes, in, sports, such, as, gymnastics, and, competitive, diving, compete, against, each, other, in, order, to, come, closest, to, a, conceptual, ideal, of, a, perfect, performance, which, incorporates, measurable, criteria, and, standards, which, are, translated, into, numerical, ratings, and, scores, by, appointed, judges, sports, competition, is, generally, broken, down, into, three, categories, individual, sports, such, as, archery, dual, sports, such, as, doubles, tennis, and, team, sports, competition, such, as, cricket, or, football, while, most, sports, competitions, are, recreation, there, exist, several, major, and, minor, professional, sports, leagues, throughout, the, world, the, olympic, games, held, every, four, years, is, usually, regarded, as, the, international, pinnacle, of, sports, competition, competition, is, also, found, in, trade, for, nations, as, well, as, firms, it, is, important, to, understand, trade, dynamics, in, order, to, market, their, goods, and, services, effectively, in, international, markets, balance, of, trade, can, be, considered, a, crude, but, widely, used, proxy, for, international, competitiveness, across, levels, country, industry, or, even, firm, we, share, a, common, belief, that, innovation, comes, from, the, edges, said, luisa, delgado, an, sap, hr, director, who, noted, the, company, valued, the, ability, of, many, autistic, people, to, think, differently, and, spark, innovation, sap, s, bangalore, office, saw, its, productivity, increase, after, deploying, autistic, hires, the, company, is, working, closely, with, a, danish, not, for, profit, specializing, in, it, job, placements, for, individuals, with, autism, spectrum, disorders, research, data, hints, that, exporting, firms, have, a, higher, survival, rate, and, achieve, greater, employment, growth, compared, with, non, exporters, using, a, simple, concept, to, measure, heights, that, firms, can, climb, may, help, improve, execution, of, strategies, international, competitiveness, can, be, measured, on, several, criteria, but, few, are, as, flexible, and, versatile, to, be, applied, across, levels, as, trade, competitiveness, index, tci, the, tendency, toward, extreme, unhealthy, competition, has, been, termed, hypercompetitiveness, this, concept, originated, in, karen, horney, s, theories, on, neurosis, specifically, the, highly, aggressive, personality, type, which, is, characterized, as, moving, against, people, in, her, view, some, people, have, a, need, to, compete, and, win, at, all, costs, as, a, means, of, maintaining,
