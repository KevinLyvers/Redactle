or, socialisation, see, spelling, differences, is, the, process, of, internalizing, the, norms, and, ideologies, of, society, socialization, encompasses, both, learning, and, teaching, and, is, thus, the, means, by, which, social, and, cultural, continuity, are, attained, 5, socialization, is, strongly, connected, to, developmental, psychology, humans, need, social, experiences, to, learn, their, culture, and, to, survive, socialization, essentially, represents, the, whole, process, of, learning, throughout, the, life, course, and, is, a, central, influence, on, the, behavior, beliefs, and, actions, of, adults, as, well, as, of, children, socialization, may, lead, to, desirable, outcomes, sometimes, labeled, moral, as, regards, the, society, where, it, occurs, individual, views, are, influenced, by, the, society, s, consensus, and, usually, tend, toward, what, that, society, finds, acceptable, or, normal, socialization, provides, only, a, partial, explanation, for, human, beliefs, and, behaviors, maintaining, that, agents, are, not, blank, slates, predetermined, by, their, environment, scientific, research, provides, evidence, that, people, are, shaped, by, both, social, influences, and, genes, genetic, studies, have, shown, that, a, person, s, environment, interacts, with, their, genotype, to, influence, behavioral, outcomes, it, is, the, process, by, which, individuals, learn, their, own, societies, culture, notions, of, society, and, the, state, of, nature, have, existed, for, centuries, 20, in, its, earliest, usages, socialization, was, simply, the, act, of, socializing, or, another, word, for, socialism, socialization, as, a, concept, originated, concurrently, with, sociology, as, sociology, was, defined, as, the, treatment, of, the, specifically, social, the, process, and, forms, of, socialization, as, such, in, contrast, to, the, interests, and, contents, which, find, expression, in, socialization, in, particular, socialization, consisted, of, the, formation, and, development, of, social, groups, and, also, the, development, of, a, social, state, of, mind, in, the, individuals, who, associate, socialization, is, thus, both, a, cause, and, an, effect, of, association, the, term, was, relatively, uncommon, before, 1940, but, became, popular, after, world, war, ii, appearing, in, dictionaries, and, scholarly, works, such, as, the, theory, of, talcott, parsons, lawrence, kohlberg, studied, moral, reasoning, and, developed, a, theory, of, how, individuals, reason, situations, as, right, from, wrong, the, first, stage, is, the, pre, conventional, stage, where, a, person, typically, children, experience, the, world, in, terms, of, pain, and, pleasure, with, their, moral, decisions, solely, reflecting, this, experience, second, the, conventional, stage, typical, for, adolescents, and, adults, is, characterized, by, an, acceptance, of, society, s, conventions, concerning, right, and, wrong, even, when, there, are, no, consequences, for, obedience, or, disobedience, finally, the, post, conventional, stage, more, rarely, achieved, occurs, if, a, person, moves, beyond, society, s, norms, to, consider, abstract, ethical, principles, when, making, moral, decisions, erik, h, erikson, 1902, 1994, explained, the, challenges, throughout, the, life, course, the, first, stage, in, the, life, course, is, infancy, where, babies, learn, trust, and, mistrust, the, second, stage, is, toddlerhood, where, children, around, the, age, of, two, struggle, with, the, challenge, of, autonomy, versus, doubt, in, stage, three, preschool, children, struggle, to, understand, the, difference, between, initiative, and, guilt, stage, four, pre, adolescence, children, learn, about, industriousness, and, inferiority, in, the, fifth, stage, called, adolescence, teenagers, experience, the, challenge, of, gaining, identity, versus, confusion, the, sixth, stage, young, adulthood, is, when, young, people, gain, insight, into, life, when, dealing, with, the, challenge, of, intimacy, and, isolation, in, stage, seven, or, middle, adulthood, people, experience, the, challenge, of, trying, to, make, a, difference, versus, self, absorption, in, the, final, stage, stage, eight, or, old, age, people, are, still, learning, about, the, challenge, of, integrity, and, despair, this, concept, has, been, further, developed, by, klaus, hurrelmann, and, gudrun, quenzel, using, the, dynamic, model, of, developmental, tasks, george, herbert, mead, 1863, 1931, developed, a, theory, of, social, behaviorism, to, explain, how, social, experience, develops, an, individual, s, self, concept, mead, s, central, concept, is, the, self, it, is, composed, of, self, awareness, and, self, image, mead, claimed, that, the, self, is, not, there, at, birth, rather, it, is, developed, with, social, experience, since, social, experience, is, the, exchange, of, symbols, people, tend, to, find, meaning, in, every, action, seeking, meaning, leads, us, to, imagine, the, intention, of, others, understanding, intention, requires, imagining, the, situation, from, the, other, s, point, of, view, in, effect, others, are, a, mirror, in, which, we, can, see, ourselves, charles, horton, cooley, 1902, 1983, coined, the, term, looking, glass, self, which, means, self, image, based, on, how, we, think, others, see, us, according, to, mead, the, key, to, developing, the, self, is, learning, to, take, the, role, of, the, other, with, limited, social, experience, infants, can, only, develop, a, sense, of, identity, through, imitation, gradually, children, learn, to, take, the, roles, of, several, others, the, final, stage, is, the, generalized, other, which, refers, to, widespread, cultural, norms, and, values, we, use, as, a, reference, for, evaluating, others, behaviorism, makes, claims, that, when, infants, are, born, they, lack, social, experience, or, self, the, social, pre, wiring, hypothesis, on, the, other, hand, shows, proof, through, a, scientific, study, that, social, behavior, is, partly, inherited, and, can, influence, infants, and, also, even, influence, foetuses, wired, to, be, social, means, that, infants, are, not, taught, that, they, are, social, beings, but, they, are, born, as, prepared, social, beings, the, social, pre, wiring, hypothesis, refers, to, the, ontogeny, of, social, interaction, also, informally, referred, to, as, wired, to, be, social, the, theory, questions, whether, there, is, a, propensity, to, socially, oriented, action, already, present, before, birth, research, in, the, theory, concludes, that, newborns, are, born, into, the, world, with, a, unique, genetic, wiring, to, be, social, circumstantial, evidence, supporting, the, social, pre, wiring, hypothesis, can, be, revealed, when, examining, newborns, behavior, newborns, not, even, hours, after, birth, have, been, found, to, display, a, preparedness, for, social, interaction, this, preparedness, is, expressed, in, ways, such, as, their, imitation, of, facial, gestures, this, observed, behavior, cannot, be, contributed, to, any, current, form, of, socialization, or, social, construction, rather, newborns, most, likely, inherit, to, some, extent, social, behavior, and, identity, through, genetics, principal, evidence, of, this, theory, is, uncovered, by, examining, twin, pregnancies, the, main, argument, is, if, there, are, social, behaviors, that, are, inherited, and, developed, before, birth, then, one, should, expect, twin, foetuses, to, engage, in, some, form, of, social, interaction, before, they, are, born, thus, ten, foetuses, were, analyzed, over, a, period, of, time, using, ultrasound, techniques, using, kinematic, analysis, the, results, of, the, experiment, were, that, the, twin, foetuses, would, interact, with, each, other, for, longer, periods, and, more, often, as, the, pregnancies, went, on, researchers, were, able, to, conclude, that, the, performance, of, movements, between, the, co, twins, was, not, accidental, but, specifically, aimed, the, social, pre, wiring, hypothesis, was, proved, correct, the, central, advance, of, this, study, is, the, demonstration, that, social, actions, are, already, performed, in, the, second, trimester, of, gestation, starting, from, the, 14th, week, of, gestation, twin, foetuses, plan, and, execute, movements, specifically, aimed, at, the, co, twin, these, findings, force, us, to, predate, the, emergence, of, social, behavior, when, the, context, enables, it, as, in, the, case, of, twin, foetuses, other, directed, actions, are, not, only, possible, but, predominant, over, self, directed, actions, primary, socialization, occurs, when, a, child, learns, the, attitudes, values, and, actions, appropriate, to, individuals, as, members, of, a, particular, culture, primary, socialization, for, a, child, is, very, important, because, it, sets, the, groundwork, for, all, future, socialization, it, is, mainly, influenced, by, immediate, family, and, friends, for, example, if, a, child, s, mother, expresses, a, discriminatory, opinion, about, a, minority, or, majority, group, then, that, child, may, think, this, behavior, is, acceptable, and, could, continue, to, have, this, opinion, about, that, minority, or, majority, group, secondary, socialization, refers, to, the, process, of, learning, what, is, the, appropriate, behavior, as, a, member, of, a, smaller, group, within, the, larger, society, basically, it, involves, the, behavioral, patterns, reinforced, by, socializing, agents, of, society, secondary, socialization, takes, place, outside, the, home, it, is, where, children, and, adults, learn, how, to, act, in, a, way, that, is, appropriate, for, the, situations, they, are, in, schools, require, very, different, behavior, from, the, home, and, children, must, act, according, to, new, rules, new, teachers, have, to, act, in, a, way, that, is, different, from, pupils, and, learn, the, new, rules, from, people, around, them, secondary, socialization, is, usually, associated, with, teenagers, and, adults, and, involves, smaller, changes, than, those, occurring, in, primary, socialization, examples, of, secondary, socialization, may, include, entering, a, new, profession, or, relocating, to, a, new, environment, or, society, anticipatory, socialization, refers, to, the, processes, of, socialization, in, which, a, person, rehearses, for, future, positions, occupations, and, social, relationships, for, example, a, couple, might, move, in, together, before, getting, married, in, order, to, try, out, or, anticipate, what, living, together, will, be, like, research, by, kenneth, j, levine, and, cynthia, a, hoffner, identifies, parents, as, the, main, source, of, anticipatory, socialization, in, regard, to, jobs, and, careers, resocialization, refers, to, the, process, of, discarding, former, behavior, patterns, and, reflexes, while, accepting, new, ones, as, part, of, a, life, transition, this, can, occur, throughout, the, human, life, span, resocialization, can, be, an, intense, experience, with, individuals, experiencing, a, sharp, break, with, their, past, as, well, as, a, need, to, learn, and, be, exposed, to, radically, different, norms, and, values, one, common, example, involves, resocialization, through, a, total, institution, or, a, setting, in, which, people, are, isolated, from, the, rest, of, society, and, manipulated, by, an, administrative, staff, resocialization, via, total, institutions, involves, a, two, step, process, 1, the, staff, work, to, root, out, a, new, inmate, s, individual, identity, and, 2, the, staff, attempt, to, create, for, the, inmate, a, new, identity, other, examples, include, the, experiences, of, a, young, person, leaving, home, to, join, the, military, or, of, a, religious, convert, internalizing, the, beliefs, and, rituals, of, a, new, faith, another, example, would, be, the, process, by, which, a, transsexual, person, learns, to, function, socially, in, a, dramatically, altered, gender, role, organizational, socialization, is, the, process, whereby, an, employee, learns, the, knowledge, and, skills, necessary, to, assume, his, or, her, role, in, an, organization, as, newcomers, become, socialized, they, learn, about, the, organization, and, its, history, values, jargon, culture, and, procedures, acquired, knowledge, about, new, employees, future, work, environment, affects, the, way, they, are, able, to, apply, their, skills, and, abilities, to, their, jobs, how, actively, engaged, the, employees, are, in, pursuing, knowledge, affects, their, socialization, process, new, employees, also, learn, about, their, work, group, the, specific, people, they, will, work, with, on, a, daily, basis, their, own, role, in, the, organization, the, skills, needed, to, do, their, job, and, both, formal, procedures, and, informal, norms, socialization, functions, as, a, control, system, in, that, newcomers, learn, to, internalize, and, obey, organizational, values, and, practices, group, socialization, is, the, theory, that, an, individual, s, peer, groups, rather, than, parental, figures, become, the, primary, influence, on, personality, and, behavior, in, adulthood, parental, behavior, and, the, home, environment, has, either, no, effect, on, the, social, development, of, children, or, the, effect, varies, significantly, between, children, adolescents, spend, more, time, with, peers, than, with, parents, therefore, peer, groups, have, stronger, correlations, with, personality, development, than, parental, figures, do, for, example, twin, brothers, with, an, identical, genetic, heritage, will, differ, in, personality, because, they, have, different, groups, of, friends, not, necessarily, because, their, parents, raised, them, differently, behavioral, genetics, suggest, that, up, to, fifty, percent, of, the, variance, in, adult, personality, is, due, to, genetic, differences, the, environment, in, which, a, child, is, raised, accounts, for, only, approximately, ten, percent, in, the, variance, of, an, adult, s, personality, as, much, as, twenty, percent, of, the, variance, is, due, to, measurement, error, this, suggests, that, only, a, very, small, part, of, an, adult, s, personality, is, influenced, by, factors, which, parents, control, i, e, the, home, environment, harris, grants, that, while, siblings, do, not, have, identical, experiences, in, the, home, environment, making, it, difficult, to, associate, a, definite, figure, to, the, variance, of, personality, due, to, home, environments, the, variance, found, by, current, methods, is, so, low, that, researchers, should, look, elsewhere, to, try, to, account, for, the, remaining, variance, harris, also, states, that, developing, long, term, personality, characteristics, away, from, the, home, environment, would, be, evolutionarily, beneficial, because, future, success, is, more, likely, to, depend, on, interactions, with, peers, than, on, interactions, with, parents, and, siblings, also, because, of, already, existing, genetic, similarities, with, parents, developing, personalities, outside, of, childhood, home, environments, would, further, diversify, individuals, increasing, their, evolutionary, success, individuals, and, groups, change, their, evaluations, of, and, commitments, to, each, other, over, time, there, is, a, predictable, sequence, of, stages, that, occur, as, an, individual, transitions, through, a, group, investigation, socialization, maintenance, resocialization, and, remembrance, during, each, stage, the, individual, and, the, group, evaluate, each, other, which, leads, to, an, increase, or, decrease, in, commitment, to, socialization, this, socialization, pushes, the, individual, from, prospective, to, new, full, marginal, and, ex, member, stage, 1, investigation, this, stage, is, marked, by, a, cautious, search, for, information, the, individual, compares, groups, in, order, to, determine, which, one, will, fulfill, their, needs, reconnaissance, while, the, group, estimates, the, value, of, the, potential, member, recruitment, the, end, of, this, stage, is, marked, by, entry, to, the, group, whereby, the, group, asks, the, individual, to, join, and, they, accept, the, offer, stage, 2, socialization, now, that, the, individual, has, moved, from, a, prospective, member, to, a, new, member, the, recruit, must, accept, the, group, s, culture, at, this, stage, the, individual, accepts, the, group, s, norms, values, and, perspectives, assimilation, and, the, group, may, adapt, to, fit, the, new, member, s, needs, accommodation, the, acceptance, transition, point, is, then, reached, and, the, individual, becomes, a, full, member, however, this, transition, can, be, delayed, if, the, individual, or, the, group, reacts, negatively, for, example, the, individual, may, react, cautiously, or, misinterpret, other, members, reactions, in, the, belief, that, they, will, be, treated, differently, as, a, newcomer, stage, 3, maintenance, during, this, stage, the, individual, and, the, group, negotiate, what, contribution, is, expected, of, members, role, negotiation, while, many, members, remain, in, this, stage, until, the, end, of, their, membership, some, individuals, may, become, dissatisfied, with, their, role, in, the, group, or, fail, to, meet, the, group, s, expectations, divergence, stage, 4, resocialization, if, the, divergence, point, is, reached, the, former, full, member, takes, on, the, role, of, a, marginal, member, and, must, be, resocialized, there, are, two, possible, outcomes, of, resocialization, the, parties, resolve, their, differences, and, the, individual, becomes, a, full, member, again, convergence, or, the, group, and, the, individual, part, ways, via, expulsion, or, voluntary, exit, stage, 5, remembrance, in, this, stage, former, members, reminisce, about, their, memories, of, the, group, and, make, sense, of, their, recent, departure, if, the, group, reaches, a, consensus, on, their, reasons, for, departure, conclusions, about, the, overall, experience, of, the, group, become, part, of, the, group, s, tradition, henslin, contends, that, an, important, part, of, socialization, is, the, learning, of, culturally, defined, gender, roles, gender, socialization, refers, to, the, learning, of, behavior, and, attitudes, considered, appropriate, for, a, given, sex, boys, learn, to, be, boys, and, girls, learn, to, be, girls, this, learning, happens, by, way, of, many, different, agents, of, socialization, the, behavior, that, is, seen, to, be, appropriate, for, each, gender, is, largely, determined, by, societal, cultural, and, economic, values, in, a, given, society, gender, socialization, can, therefore, vary, considerably, among, societies, with, different, values, the, family, is, certainly, important, in, reinforcing, gender, roles, but, so, are, groups, including, friends, peers, school, work, and, the, mass, media, social, groups, reinforce, gender, roles, through, countless, subtle, and, not, so, subtle, ways, in, peer, group, activities, stereotypic, gender, roles, may, also, be, rejected, renegotiated, or, artfully, exploited, for, a, variety, of, purposes, carol, gilligan, compared, the, moral, development, of, girls, and, boys, in, her, theory, of, gender, and, moral, development, she, claimed, that, boys, have, a, justice, perspective, meaning, that, they, rely, on, formal, rules, to, define, right, and, wrong, girls, on, the, other, hand, have, a, care, and, responsibility, perspective, where, personal, relationships, are, considered, when, judging, a, situation, gilligan, also, studied, the, effect, of, gender, on, self, esteem, she, claimed, that, society, s, socialization, of, females, is, the, reason, why, girls, self, esteem, diminishes, as, they, grow, older, girls, struggle, to, regain, their, personal, strength, when, moving, through, adolescence, as, they, have, fewer, female, teachers, and, most, authority, figures, are, men, as, parents, are, present, in, a, child, s, development, from, the, beginning, their, influence, in, a, child, s, early, socialization, is, very, important, especially, in, regard, to, gender, roles, sociologists, have, identified, four, ways, in, which, parents, socialize, gender, roles, in, their, children, shaping, gender, related, attributes, through, toys, and, activities, differing, their, interaction, with, children, based, on, the, sex, of, the, child, serving, as, primary, gender, models, and, communicating, gender, ideals, and, expectations, sociologist, of, gender, r, w, connell, contends, that, socialization, theory, is, inadequate, for, explaining, gender, because, it, presumes, a, largely, consensual, process, except, for, a, few, deviants, when, really, most, children, revolt, against, pressures, to, be, conventionally, gendered, because, it, cannot, explain, contradictory, scripts, that, come, from, different, socialization, agents, in, the, same, society, and, because, it, does, not, account, for, conflict, between, the, different, levels, of, an, individual, s, gender, and, general, identity, racial, socialization, or, racial, ethnic, socialization, has, been, defined, as, the, developmental, processes, by, which, children, acquire, the, behaviors, perceptions, values, and, attitudes, of, an, ethnic, group, and, come, to, see, themselves, and, others, as, members, of, the, group, the, existing, literature, conceptualizes, racial, socialization, as, having, multiple, dimensions, researchers, have, identified, five, dimensions, that, commonly, appear, in, the, racial, socialization, literature, cultural, socialization, preparation, for, bias, promotion, of, mistrust, egalitarianism, and, other, cultural, socialization, sometimes, referred, to, as, pride, development, refers, to, parenting, practices, that, teach, children, about, their, racial, history, or, heritage, preparation, for, bias, refers, to, parenting, practices, focused, on, preparing, children, to, be, aware, of, and, cope, with, discrimination, promotion, of, mistrust, refers, to, the, parenting, practices, of, socializing, children, to, be, wary, of, people, from, other, races, egalitarianism, refers, to, socializing, children, with, the, belief, that, all, people, are, equal, and, should, be, treated, with, common, humanity, in, the, united, states, white, people, are, socialized, to, perceive, race, as, a, zero, sum, game, and, a, black, white, binary, oppression, socialization, refers, to, the, process, by, which, individuals, develop, understandings, of, power, and, political, structure, particularly, as, these, inform, perceptions, of, identity, power, and, opportunity, relative, to, gender, racialized, group, membership, and, sexuality, this, action, is, a, form, of, political, socialization, in, its, relation, to, power, and, the, persistent, compliance, of, the, disadvantaged, with, their, oppression, using, limited, overt, coercion, based, on, comparative, research, in, different, societies, and, focusing, on, the, role, of, language, in, child, development, linguistic, anthropologists, elinor, ochs, and, bambi, schieffelin, have, developed, the, theory, of, language, socialization, they, discovered, that, the, processes, of, enculturation, and, socialization, do, not, occur, apart, from, the, process, of, language, acquisition, but, that, children, acquire, language, and, culture, together, in, what, amounts, to, an, integrated, process, members, of, all, societies, socialize, children, both, to, and, through, the, use, of, language, acquiring, competence, in, a, language, the, novice, is, by, the, same, token, socialized, into, the, categories, and, norms, of, the, culture, while, the, culture, in, turn, provides, the, norms, of, the, use, of, language, planned, socialization, occurs, when, other, people, take, actions, designed, to, teach, or, train, others, this, type, of, socialization, can, take, on, many, forms, and, can, occur, at, any, point, from, infancy, onward, natural, socialization, occurs, when, infants, and, youngsters, explore, play, and, discover, the, social, world, around, them, natural, socialization, is, easily, seen, when, looking, at, the, young, of, almost, any, mammalian, species, and, some, birds, on, the, other, hand, planned, socialization, is, mostly, a, human, phenomenon, all, through, history, people, have, made, plans, for, teaching, or, training, others, both, natural, and, planned, socialization, can, have, good, and, bad, qualities, it, is, useful, to, learn, the, best, features, of, both, natural, and, planned, socialization, in, order, to, incorporate, them, into, life, in, a, meaningful, way, socialization, produces, the, economic, social, and, political, development, of, any, particular, country, the, nature, of, the, compromise, between, nature, and, nurture, also, determines, whether, society, is, good, or, harmful, political, socialization, is, described, as, the, long, developmental, process, by, which, an, infant, even, an, adult, citizen, learns, imbibes, and, ultimately, internalizes, the, political, culture, core, political, values, beliefs, norms, and, ideology, of, his, political, system, in, order, to, make, him, a, more, informed, and, effective, political, participant, a, society, s, political, culture, is, inculcated, in, its, citizens, and, passed, down, from, one, generation, to, the, next, as, part, of, the, political, socialization, process, agents, of, socialization, are, thus, people, organizations, or, institutions, that, have, an, impact, on, how, people, perceive, themselves, behave, or, have, other, orientations, in, contemporary, democratic, government, political, parties, are, the, main, forces, behind, political, socialization, socialization, enhances, business, trade, and, foreign, investment, globally,

in, order, to, construct, a, decent, and, democratic, society, for, nation, building, developing, nations, can, transfer, agricultural, technology, and, machinery, like, tractors, harvesters, and, agrochemicals, to, enhance, the, agricultural, sector, of, the, economy, through, socialization, positive, socialization, is, the, type, of, social, learning, that, is, based, on, pleasurable, and, exciting, experiences, individual, humans, tend, to, like, the, people, who, fill, their, social, learning, processes, with, positive, motivation, loving, care, and, rewarding, opportunities, positive, socialization, occurs, when, desired, behaviors, are, reinforced, with, a, reward, encouraging, the, individual, to, continue, exhibiting, similar, behaviors, in, the, future, negative, socialization, occurs, when, socialialization, agents, use, punishment, harsh, criticisms, or, anger, to, try, to, teach, us, a, lesson, and, often, we, come, to, dislike, both, negative, socialization, and, the, people, who, impose, it, on, us, there, are, all, types, of, mixes, of, positive, and, negative, socialization, and, the, more, positive, social, learning, experiences, we, have, the, happier, we, tend, to, be, especially, if, we, are, able, to, learn, useful, information, that, helps, us, cope, well, with, the, challenges, of, life, a, high, ratio, of, negative, to, positive, socialization, can, make, a, person, unhappy, leading, to, defeated, or, pessimistic, feelings, about, life, bullying, can, examplify, negative, socialization, in, the, social, sciences, institutions, are, the, structures, and, mechanisms, of, social, order, and, cooperation, governing, the, behavior, of, individuals, within, a, given, human, collectivity, institutions, are,
