have, pagan, roots, that, after, christian, influence, were, turned, from, names, of, deities, and, spirits, to, profanity, and, used, as, such, like, famous, finnish, profanity, word, perkele, which, was, believed, to, be, an, original, name, of, the, thunder, god, ukko, the, chief, god, of, the, finnish, pagan, pantheon, profanities, in, the, original, meaning, of, blasphemous, profanity, are, part, of, the, ancient, tradition, of, the, comic, cults, which, laughed, and, scoffed, at, the, deity, or, deities, an, example, of, this, would, be, lucian, s, dialogues, of, the, gods, satire, 110,

alternatives, are, often, latin, in, origin, such, as, defecate, or, excrete, for, shit, and, fornicate, or, copulate, for, fuck, due, to, the, stereotype, of, english, profanity, being, largely, germanic, profanity, is, sometimes, referred, to, colloquially, as, anglo, saxon, in, reference, to, the, oldest, form, of, english, this, isn, t, always, the, case, the, word, wanker, is, considered, profane, in, britain, but, it, dates, only, to, the, mid, 20th, century, words, currently, considered, curse, words, or, profanity, were, common, parlance, in, medieval, english, in, the, elizabethan, era, some, playwrights, like, shakespeare, largely, avoided, direct, use, of, these, words, but, others, like, ben, jonson, did, use, them, in, his, plays, the, word, fuck, was, likely, first, used, in, english, borrowed, in, the, 15th, century, though, the, use, of, shit, in, english, is, much, older, rooted, in, the, proto, germanic, word, skit, then, evolved, in, middle, english, to, the,

avenues, of, research, according, to, steven, pinker, there, are, five, possible, functions, of, swearing, another, reason, for, swearing, is, coprolalia, which, is, an, occasional, characteristic, of, tic, disorders, is, involuntary, swearing, or, the, involuntary, utterance, of, obscene, words, or, socially, inappropriate, and, derogatory, remarks, it, encompasses, words, and, phrases, that, are, culturally, taboo, or, generally, unsuitable, for, acceptable, social, use, when, used, out, of, context, the, term, is, not, used, to, describe, contextual, swearing, it, can, be, distinguished, from, voluntary, profanity, by, characteristics, such, as, interrupting, the, flow, of, dialogue, differences, in, tone, and, volume, relative, to, a, normal, voice, variable, frequency, that, increases, with, anxiety, and, association, with, brain, disorders, it, is, usually, expressed, out, of, social, or, emotional, context, and, may, be, spoken, in, a, louder, tone, or, different, cadence, or, pitch, than, normal, conversation, it, can, be, a, single, word, or, complex, phrases, a, group, of, researchers, from, wright, state, university, studied, why, people, swear, in, the, online, world, by, collecting, tweets, posted, on, twitter, they, found, that, cursing, is, associated, with, negative, emotions, such, as, sadness, 21, 83, and, anger, 16, 79, thus, showing, people, in, the, online, world, mainly, use, curse, words, to, express, their, sadness, and, anger, towards, others, analyses, of, recorded, conversations, c, 1972, revealed, that, an, average, of, roughly, 80, 90, words, that, a, person, spoke, each, day, 0, 5, to, 0, 7, of, all, words, were, curse, words, with, usage, varying, from, 0, to, 3, 4, in, comparison, first, person, plural, pronouns, we, us, our, make, up, 1, of, spoken, words, a, three, country, poll, conducted, by, angus, reid, public, opinion, in, july, 2010, found, that, canadians, swear, more, often, than, americans, and, british, when, talking, to, friends, while, britons, are, more, likely, than, canadians, and, americans, to, hear, strangers, swear, during, a, conversation, new, york, times, author, natalie, angier, notes, that, men, generally, curse, more, than, women, unless, said, women, are, in, a, sorority, and, that, university, provosts, swear, more, than, librarians, or, the, staff, members, of, the, university, day, care, center, a, 2017, paper, by, gilad, feldman, and, co, workers, claimed, to, show, a, correlation, between, swearing, and, various, measures, of, honesty, from, three, separate, studies, the, authors, found, a, consistent, positive, relationship, between, profanity, and, honesty, profanity, was, associated, with, less, lying, and, deception, at, the, individual, level, and, with, higher, integrity, at, the, society, level, however, the, methodology, of, this, study, has, been, challenged, by, other, psychologists, and, the, study, is, a, subject, of, ongoing, controversy, there, is, no, evidence, that, swearing, has, harmful, effects, such, as, leading, to, increased, physical, violence, a, 2009, study, by, stephens, atkins, and, kingston, found, that, swearing, increases, pain, tolerance, by, eliciting, a, fight, or, flight, response, quashing, the, link, between, the, fear, of, pain, and, the, perception, of, pain, itself, stephens, said, i, would, advise, people, if, they, hurt, themselves, to, swear, however, the, overuse, of, swear, words, tends, to, diminish, this, effect, the, keele, team, won, the, ig, nobel, peace, prize, in, 2010, for, their, research, a, team, of, neurologists, and, psychologists, at, the, ucla, easton, center, for, alzheimer, s, disease, research, suggested, that, swearing, may, help, differentiate, alzheimer, s, disease, from, frontotemporal, dementia, neurologist, antonio, damasio, noted, that, despite, the, loss, of, language, due, to, damage, to, the, language, areas, of, the, brain, patients, were, still, often, able, to, swear, an, interdisciplinary, team, of, researchers, from, the, university, of, warsaw, investigated, bilingual, swearing, and, how, it, is, easier, to, swear, in, a, foreign, language, finding, that, bilinguals, strengthen, the, offensiveness, of, profanities, when, they, switch, into, their, second, language, but, soften, it, when, they, switch, into, their, first, tongue, doing, both, statistically, significantly, only, in, the, case, of, ethnophaulisms, ethnic, slurs, leading, the, scientists, to, the, conclusion, that, switching, into, the, second, language, exempts, bilinguals, from, the, social, norms, and, constraints, whether, own, or, socially, imposed, such, as, political, correctness, and, makes, them, more, prone, to, swearing, and, offending, others, research, by, jay, and, janschewitz, suggests, that, swearing, emerges, by, age, two, by, the, time, children, enter, school, they, have, a, working, vocabulary, of, 30, 40, offensive, words, and, their, swearing, becomes, similar, to, that, of, adults, around, the, age, of, 11, to, 12, unlike, the, rest, of, language, children, are, generally, not, taught, the, grammatical, aspects, of, how, to, swear, competently, in, school, raising, the, question, of, how, they, do, learn, this, skill, there, is, no, established, consensus, as, to, how, children, learn, to, swear, although, it, is, an, inevitable, part, of, language, learning, and, begins, early, in, life, young, school, children, may, adopt, various, toning, down, strategies, when, swearing, depending, on, the, context, in, which, they, are, talking, new, york, times, author, natalie, angier, notes, that, functionally, similar, behavior, can, be, observed, in, chimpanzees, and, may, contribute, to, our, understanding, profanity, is, widely, considered, socially, offensive, and, strongly, impolite, slurs, however, are, both, intended, to, be, and, by, definition, are, derogatory, as, they, are, meant, to, harm, another, individual, although, profanity, has, been, seen, to, improve, performance, or, relieve, anxiety, and, anger, and, can, be, used, in, a, lighthearted, way, this, effect, and, impact, cannot, be, observed, with, slurs, though, slurs, are, considered, profanity, by, definition, being, both, socially, offensive, and, strongly, impolite, profanity, can, be, used, in, a, non, targeted, manner, where, slurs, cannot, for, example, in, the, sentence, if, i, don, t, get, an, a, on, this, exam, i, m, fucked, the, word, fucked, is, profanity, however, the, way, it, is, embedded, is, not, intended, to, offend, anyone, as, the, speaker, is, not, making, an, offensive, claim, minced, oaths, are, euphemistic, expressions, made, by, altering, or, clipping, profane, and, blasphemous, words, and, expressions, to, make, them, less, or, not, objectionable, although, minced, oaths, are, often, acceptable, in, situations, where, profanity, is, not, including, the, radio, some, people, still,

against, swearing, in, the, presence, of, women, and, against, women, swearing, to, be, sexist, especially, when, it, restricts, the, expressiveness, of, the, speech, of, women, more, than, men, roache, also, relates, an, example, of, disrespect, and, ableism, a, person, who, uses, a, digital, speech, synthesizer, found, that, instead, of, the, normal, reaction, of, being, offended, when,
