multilingualism, is, the, use, of, more, than, one, language, either, by, an, individual, speaker, or, by, a, group, of, speakers, it, is, believed, that, multilingual, speakers, outnumber, monolingual, speakers, in, the, world, s, population, more, than, half, of, all, europeans, claim, to, speak, at, least, one, language, other, than, their, mother, tongue, but, many, read, and, write, in, one, language, being, multilingual, is, advantageous, for, people, wanting, to, participate, in, trade, globalization, and, cultural, openness, owing, to, the, ease, of, access, to, information, facilitated, by, the, internet, individuals, exposure, to, multiple, languages, has, become, increasingly, possible, people, who, speak, several, languages, are, also, called, polyglots, multilingual, speakers, have, acquired, and, maintained, at, least, one, language, during, childhood, the, so, called, first, language, l1, the, first, language, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, the, mother, tongue, is, usually, acquired, without, formal, education, by, mechanisms, about, which, scholars, disagree, children, acquiring, two, languages, natively, from, these, early, years, are, called, simultaneous, bilinguals, it, is, common, for, young, simultaneous, bilinguals, to, be, more, proficient, in, one, language, than, the, other, people, who, speak, more, than, one, language, have, been, reported, to, be, better, at, language, learning, when, compared, to, monolinguals, multilingualism, in, computing, can, be, considered, part, of, a, continuum, between, internationalization, and, localization, due, to, the, status, of, english, in, computing, software, development, nearly, always, uses, it, but, not, in, the, case, of, non, english, based, programming, languages, some, commercial, software, is, initially, available, in, an, english, version, and, multilingual, versions, if, any, may, be, produced, as, alternative, options, based, on, the, english, original, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, word, multilingual, in, the, english, language, occurred, in, the, 1830s, the, word, is, a, combination, of, multi, many, and, lingual, pertaining, to, languages, the, phenomenon, of, multilingualism, is, as, old, as, the, very, existence, of, different, languages, today, evidence, of, multilingualism, in, an, area, includes, things, such, as, bilingual, signs, which, represent, the, same, message, in, more, than, one, language, historical, examples, include, glosses, in, textual, sources, which, can, provide, notes, in, a, different, language, from, the, source, text, macaronic, texts, which, mix, together, two, or, more, languages, with, the, expectation, that, the, reader, will, understand, both, the, existence, of, separate, sacred, and, vernacular, languages, such, as, church, latin, vs, common, forms, of, latin, and, hebrew, vs, aramaic, and, jewish, languages, and, the, frequency, of, linguistic, borrowings, and, other, results, of, language, contact, the, definition, of, multilingualism, is, a, subject, of, debate, in, the, same, way, as, that, of, language, fluency, at, one, end, of, the, linguistic, continuum, multilingualism, may, be, defined, as, the, mastery, of, more, than, one, language, the, speaker, would, have, knowledge, of, and, control, over, the, languages, equivalent, to, that, of, a, native, speaker, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, spectrum, would, be, people, who, know, enough, phrases, to, get, around, as, a, tourist, using, the, alternate, language, since, 1992, vivian, cook, has, argued, that, most, multilingual, speakers, fall, somewhere, between, minimal, and, maximal, definitions, cook, calls, these, people, multi, competent, in, addition, there, is, no, consistent, definition, of, what, constitutes, a, distinct, language, for, instance, scholars, often, disagree, whether, scots, is, a, language, in, its, own, right, or, merely, a, dialect, of, english, furthermore, what, is, considered, a, language, can, change, often, for, purely, political, reasons, one, example, is, the, creation, of, serbo, croatian, as, a, standard, language, on, the, basis, of, the, eastern, herzegovinian, dialect, to, function, as, umbrella, for, numerous, south, slavic, dialects, after, the, breakup, of, yugoslavia, it, was, split, into, serbian, croatian, bosnian, and, montenegrin, another, example, is, the, historical, dismissal, of, ukrainian, as, a, russian, dialect, by, the, russian, tsars, to, discourage, national, feelings, many, small, independent, nations, schoolchildren, are, today, compelled, to, learn, multiple, languages, because, of, international, interactions, for, example, in, finland, all, children, are, required, to, learn, at, least, three, languages, the, two, national, languages, finnish, and, swedish, and, one, foreign, language, usually, english, many, finnish, schoolchildren, also, study, further, languages, such, as, german, or, russian, in, some, large, nations, with, multiple, languages, such, as, india, schoolchildren, may, routinely, learn, multiple, languages, based, on, where, they, reside, in, the, country, in, many, countries, bilingualism, occurs, through, international, relations, which, with, english, being, a, global, lingua, franca, sometimes, results, in, majority, bilingualism, even, when, the, countries, in, question, have, just, one, domestic, official, language, this, occurs, especially, in, regions, such, as, scandinavia, and, the, benelux, as, well, as, among, germanophones, but, the, phenomenon, has, also, been, expanding, into, some, non, germanic, countries, one, view, is, that, of, the, linguist, noam, chomsky, in, what, he, calls, the, human, language, acquisition, device, a, mechanism, that, enables, a, learner, to, recreate, correctly, the, rules, and, certain, other, characteristics, of, language, used, by, surrounding, speakers, this, device, according, to, chomsky, wears, out, over, time, and, is, not, normally, available, by, puberty, which, he, uses, to, explain, the, poor, results, some, adolescents, and, adults, have, when, learning, aspects, of, a, second, language, l2, if, language, learning, is, a, cognitive, process, rather, than, a, language, acquisition, device, as, the, school, led, by, stephen, krashen, suggests, there, would, only, be, relative, not, categorical, differences, between, the, two, types, of, language, learning, rod, ellis, quotes, research, finding, that, the, earlier, children, learn, a, second, language, the, better, off, they, are, in, terms, of, pronunciation, european, schools, generally, offer, secondary, language, classes, for, their, students, early, on, due, to, the, interconnectedness, among, neighboring, countries, with, different, languages, most, european, students, now, study, at, least, two, foreign, languages, a, process, strongly, encouraged, by, the, european, union, based, on, the, research, in, ann, fathman, s, the, relationship, between, age, and, second, language, productive, ability, there, is, a, difference, in, the, rate, of, learning, of, english, morphology, syntax, and, phonology, based, upon, differences, in, age, but, the, order, of, acquisition, in, second, language, learning, does, not, change, with, age, in, second, language, class, students, commonly, face, difficulties, in, thinking, in, the, target, language, because, they, are, influenced, by, their, native, language, and, cultural, patterns, robert, b, kaplan, believes, that, in, second, language, classes, foreign, students, papers, may, seem, out, of, focus, because, the, foreign, student, employs, rhetoric, and, sequences, of, thought, that, violate, the, expectations, of, the, native, reader, foreign, students, who, have, mastered, syntactic, structures, have, still, demonstrated, an, inability, to, compose, adequate, themes, term, papers, theses, and, dissertations, robert, b, kaplan, describes, two, key, words, that, affect, people, when, they, learn, a, second, language, logic, in, the, popular, rather, than, the, logician, s, sense, of, the, word, is, the, basis, of, rhetoric, evolved, out, of, a, culture, it, is, not, universal, rhetoric, then, is, not, universal, either, but, varies, from, culture, to, culture, and, even, from, time, to, time, within, a, given, culture, language, teachers, know, how, to, predict, the, differences, between, pronunciations, or, constructions, in, different, languages, but, they, might, be, less, clear, about, the, differences, between, rhetoric, that, is, in, the, way, they, use, language, to, accomplish, various, purposes, particularly, in, writing, people, who, learn, multiple, languages, may, also, experience, positive, transfer, the, process, by, which, it, becomes, easier, to, learn, additional, languages, if, the, grammar, or, vocabulary, of, the, new, language, is, similar, to, those, of, the, languages, already, spoken, on, the, other, hand, students, may, also, experience, negative, transfer, interference, from, languages, learned, at, an, earlier, stage, of, development, while, learning, a, new, language, later, in, life, translanguaging, also, supports, the, acquisition, of, new, languages, it, helps, the, development, of, new, languages, by, forming, connections, from, one, language, to, another, second, language, acquisition, results, in, a, lexical, deficit, receptive, bilinguals, are, those, who, can, understand, a, second, language, but, who, cannot, speak, it, or, whose, abilities, to, speak, it, are, inhibited, by, psychological, barriers, receptive, bilingualism, is, frequently, encountered, among, adult, immigrants, to, the, u, s, who, do, not, speak, english, as, a, native, language, but, who, have, children, who, do, speak, english, natively, usually, in, part, because, those, children, s, education, has, been, conducted, in, english, while, the, immigrant, parents, can, understand, both, their, native, language, and, english, they, speak, only, their, native, language, to, their, children, if, their, children, are, likewise, receptively, bilingual, but, productively, english, monolingual, throughout, the, conversation, the, parents, will, speak, their, native, language, and, the, children, will, speak, english, if, their, children, are, productively, bilingual, however, those, children, may, answer, in, their, parents, native, language, in, english, or, in, a, combination, of, both, languages, varying, their, choice, of, language, depending, on, factors, such, as, the, communication, s, content, context, or, emotional, intensity, and, the, presence, or, absence, of, third, party, speakers, of, one, language, or, the, other, the, third, alternative, represents, the, phenomenon, of, code, switching, in, which, the, productively, bilingual, party, to, a, communication, switches, languages, in, the, course, of, that, communication, receptively, bilingual, persons, especially, children, may, rapidly, achieve, oral, fluency, by, spending, extended, time, in, situations, where, they, are, required, to, speak, the, language, that, they, theretofore, understood, only, passively, until, both, generations, achieve, oral, fluency, not, all, definitions, of, bilingualism, accurately, characterize, the, family, as, a, whole, but, the, linguistic, differences, between, the, family, s, generations, often, constitute, little, or, no, impairment, to, the, family, s, functionality, receptive, bilingualism, in, one, language, as, exhibited, by, a, speaker, of, another, language, or, even, as, exhibited, by, most, speakers, of, that, language, is, not, the, same, as, mutual, intelligibility, of, languages, the, latter, is, a, property, of, a, pair, of, languages, namely, a, consequence, of, objectively, high, lexical, and, grammatical, similarities, between, the, languages, themselves, e, g, norwegian, and, swedish, whereas, the, former, is, a, property, of, one, or, more, persons, and, is, determined, by, subjective, or, intersubjective, factors, such, as, the, respective, languages, prevalence, in, the, life, history, including, family, upbringing, educational, setting, and, ambient, culture, of, the, person, or, persons, in, sequential, bilingualism, learners, receive, literacy, instruction, in, their, native, language, until, they, acquire, a, threshold, literacy, proficiency, some, researchers, use, age, three, as, the, age, when, a, child, has, basic, communicative, competence, in, their, first, language, kessler, 1984, children, may, go, through, a, process, of, sequential, acquisition, if, they, migrate, at, a, young, age, to, a, country, where, a, different, language, is, spoken, or, if, the, child, exclusively, speaks, his, or, her, heritage, language, at, home, until, he, or, she, is, immersed, in, a, school, setting, where, instruction, is, offered, in, a, different, language, in, simultaneous, bilingualism, the, native, language, and, the, community, language, are, simultaneously, taught, the, advantage, is, literacy, in, two, languages, as, the, outcome, however, the, teacher, must, be, well, versed, in, both, languages, and, also, in, techniques, for, teaching, a, second, language, the, phases, children, go, through, during, sequential, acquisition, are, less, linear, than, for, simultaneous, acquisition, and, can, vary, greatly, among, children, sequential, acquisition, is, a, more, complex, and, lengthier, process, although, there, is, no, indication, that, non, language, delayed, children, end, up, less, proficient, than, simultaneous, bilinguals, so, long, as, they, receive, adequate, input, in, both, languages, a, coordinate, model, posits, that, equal, time, should, be, spent, in, separate, instruction, of, the, native, language, and, the, community, language, the, native, language, class, however, focuses, on, basic, literacy, while, the, community, language, class, focuses, on, listening, and, speaking, skills, being, bilingual, does, not, necessarily, mean, that, one, can, speak, for, example, english, and, french, research, has, found, that, the, development, of, competence, in, the, native, language, serves, as, a, foundation, of, proficiency, that, can, be, transposed, to, the, second, language, the, common, underlying, proficiency, hypothesis, cummins, work, sought, to, overcome, the, perception, propagated, in, the, 1960s, that, learning, two, languages, made, for, two, competing, aims, the, belief, was, that, the, two, languages, were, mutually, exclusive, and, that, learning, a, second, required, unlearning, elements, and, dynamics, of, the, first, to, accommodate, the, second, the, evidence, for, this, perspective, relied, on, the, fact, that, some, errors, in, acquiring, the, second, language, were, related, to, the, rules, of, the, first, language, another, new, development, that, has, influenced, the, linguistic, argument, for, bilingual, literacy, is, the, length, of, time, necessary, to, acquire, a, second, language, previously, children, were, believed, to, have, the, ability, to, learn, a, language, within, a, year, but, today, researchers, believe, that, within, and, across, academic, settings, the, period, is, closer, to, five, years, an, interesting, outcome, of, studies, during, the, early, 1990s, however, confirmed, that, students, who, do, complete, bilingual, instruction, perform, better, academically, these, students, exhibit, more, cognitive, flexibility, including, a, better, ability, to, analyze, abstract, visual, patterns, students, who, receive, bidirectional, bilingual, instruction, where, equal, proficiency, in, both, languages, is, required, will, perform, at, an, even, higher, level, examples, of, such, programs, include, international, and, multi, national, education, schools, a, multilingual, person, is, someone, who, can, communicate, in, more, than, one, language, actively, through, speaking, writing, or, signing, multilingual, people, can, logically, speak, any, language, they, write, in, aside, from, mute, multilingual, people, but, they, cannot, necessarily, write, in, any, language, they, speak, more, specifically, bilingual, and, trilingual, people, are, those, in, comparable, situations, involving, two, or, three, languages, respectively, a, multilingual, person, is, generally, referred, to, as, a, polyglot, a, term, that, may, also, refer, to, people, who, learn, multiple, languages, as, a, hobby, multilingual, speakers, have, acquired, and, maintained, at, least, one, language, during, childhood, the, so, called, first, language, l1, the, first, language, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, the, mother, tongue, is, acquired, without, formal, education, by, mechanisms, heavily, disputed, children, acquiring, two, languages, in, this, way, are, called, simultaneous, bilinguals, even, in, the, case, of, simultaneous, bilinguals, one, language, usually, dominates, over, the, other, in, linguistics, first, language, acquisition, is, closely, related, to, the, concept, of, a, native, speaker, according, to, a, view, widely, held, by, linguists, a, native, speaker, of, a, given, language, has, in, some, respects, a, level, of, skill, that, a, second, or, subsequent, language, learner, cannot, easily, accomplish, consequently, descriptive, empirical, studies, of, languages, are, usually, carried, out, using, only, native, speakers, this, view, is, however, slightly, problematic, particularly, as, many, non, native, speakers, demonstrably, not, only, successfully, engage, with, and, in, their, non, native, language, societies, but, in, fact, may, become, culturally, and, even, linguistically, important, contributors, as, for, example, writers, politicians, media, personalities, and, performing, artists, in, their, non, native, language, in, recent, years, linguistic, research, has, focused, attention, on, the, use, of, widely, known, world, languages, such, as, english, as, a, lingua, franca, or, a, shared, common, language, of, professional, and, commercial, communities, in, lingua, franca, situations, most, speakers, of, the, common, language, are, functionally, multilingual, the, reverse, phenomenon, where, people, who, know, more, than, one, language, end, up, losing, command, of, some, or, all, of, their, additional, languages, is, called, language, attrition, it, has, been, documented, that, under, certain, conditions, individuals, may, lose, their, l1, language, proficiency, completely, after, switching, to, the, exclusive, use, of, another, language, and, effectively, become, native, in, a, language, that, was, once, secondary, after, the, l1, undergoes, total, attrition, this, is, most, commonly, seen, among, immigrant, communities, and, has, been, the, subject, of, substantial, academic, study, the, most, important, factor, in, spontaneous, total, l1, loss, appears, to, be, age, in, the, absence, of, neurological, dysfunction, or, injury, only, young, children, typically, are, at, risk, of, forgetting, their, native, language, and, switching, to, a, new, one, once, they, pass, an, age, that, seems, to, correlate, closely, with, the, critical, period, around, the, age, of, 12, total, loss, of, a, native, language, is, not, typical, although, it, is, still, possible, for, speakers, to, experience, diminished, expressive, capacity, if, the, language, is, never, practiced, there, is, no, evidence, for, a, bilingual, advantage, in, executive, function, and, there, is, a, small, bilingual, disadvantage, in, verbal, fluency, some, initial, reports, concluded, that, people, who, use, more, than, one, language, have, been, reported, to, be, more, adept, at, language, learning, compared, to, monolinguals, and, this, idea, persisted, in, part, due, to, publication, bias, current, meta, analyses, find, no, effect, individuals, who, are, highly, proficient, in, two, or, more, languages, have, been, reported, to, have, a, certain, very, marginally, enhanced, or, no, different, executive, function, and, older, onset, for, dementia, more, recently, however, this, claim, has, come, under, strong, criticism, with, repeated, failures, to, replicate, yet, many, prior, studies, do, not, reliably, quantify, samples, of, bilinguals, under, investigation, an, emerging, perspective, is, that, studies, on, bilingual, and, multilingual, cognitive, abilities, need, to, account, for, validated, and, granular, quantifications, of, language, experience, in, order, to, identify, boundary, conditions, of, possible, cognitive, effects, second, language, acquisition, results, in, a, lexical, deficit, due, to, second, language, acquisition, and, bilingualism, results, in, decreased, verbal, fluency, bilingual, and, multilingual, individuals, are, shown, to, have, superior, auditory, processing, abilities, compared, to, monolingual, individuals, several, investigations, have, compared, auditory, processing, abilities, of, monolingual, and, bilingual, individuals, using, tasks, such, as, gap, detection, temporal, ordering, pitch, pattern, recognition, etc, in, general, results, of, studies, have, reported, superior, performance, among, bilingual, and, multilingual, individuals, furthermore, among, bilingual, individuals, one, s, level, of, proficiency, in, one, s, second, language, was, also, reported, to, influence, auditory, processing, abilities, bilinguals, might, have, important, labor, market, advantages, over, monolingual, individuals, as, bilingual, people, can, carry, out, duties, that, monolinguals, cannot, such, as, interacting, with, customers, who, only, speak, a, minority, language, a, study, in, switzerland, has, found, that, multilingualism, is, positively, correlated, with, an, individual, s, salary, the, productivity, of, firms, and, the, gross, domestic, production, gdp, the, authors, state, that, switzerland, s, gdp, is, augmented, by, 10, by, multilingualism, a, study, in, the, united, states, by, o, agirdag, found, that, bilingualism, has, substantial, economic, benefits, as, bilingual, people, were, found, to, earn, around, 3, 000, more, per, year, in, salary, than, monolinguals, a, study, in, 2012, has, shown, that, using, a, foreign, language, reduces, decision, making, biases, it, was, surmised, that, the, framing, effect, disappeared, when, choices, are, presented, in, a, second, language, as, human, reasoning, is, shaped, by, two, distinct, modes, of, thought, one, that, is, systematic, analytical, and, cognition, intensive, and, another, that, is, fast, unconscious, and, emotionally, charged, it, was, believed, that, a, second, language, provides, a, useful, cognitive, distance, from, automatic, processes, promoting, analytical, thought, and, reducing, unthinking, emotional, reaction, therefore, those, who, speak, two, languages, have, better, critical, thinking, and, decision, making, skills, a, study, published, a, year, later, found, that, switching, to, a, second, language, seems, to, exempt, bilinguals, from, social, norms, and, constraints, such, as, political, correctness, in, 2014, another, study, showed, that, people, using, a, foreign, language, are, more, likely, to, make, utilitarian, decisions, when, faced, with, moral, dilemmas, such, as, the, trolley, problem, and, its, variations, participants, in, this, study, chose, the, utilitarian, option, more, often, in, the, fat, man, dilemma, when, it, was, presented, in, a, foreign, language, for, the, related, switch, track, dilemma, however, the, use, of, a, foreign, language, presented, no, significant, influence, on, the, choices, participants, made, the, authors, of, this, study, surmised, that, a, foreign, language, lacks, the, emotional, impact, of, one, s, native, language, because, it, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, master, many, of, the, high, level, semantic, aspects, of, a, language, including, but, not, limited, to, its, idioms, and, eponyms, without, first, understanding, the, culture, and, history, of, the, region, in, which, that, language, evolved, as, a, practical, matter, an, in, depth, familiarity, with, multiple, cultures, is, a, prerequisite, for, high, level, multilingualism, this, knowledge, of, cultures, individually, and, comparatively, can, form, an, important, part, of, both, what, one, considers, one, s, identity, to, be, and, what, others, consider, that, identity, to, be, some, studies, have, found, that, groups, of, multilingual, individuals, get, higher, average, scores, on, tests, for, certain, personality, traits, such, as, cultural, empathy, open, mindedness, and, social, initiative, the, idea, of, linguistic, relativity, which, claims, that, the, language, people, speak, influences, the, way, they, see, the, world, can, be, interpreted, to, mean, that, individuals, who, speak, multiple, languages, have, a, broader, more, diverse, view, of, the, world, even, when, speaking, only, one, language, at, a, time, some, bilinguals, feel, that, their, personality, changes, depending, on, which, language, they, are, speaking, thus, multilingualism, is, said, to, create, multiple, personalities, xiao, lei, wang, states, in, her, book, growing, up, with, three, languages, birth, to, eleven, languages, used, by, speakers, with, one, or, more, than, one, language, are, used, not, just, to, represent, a, unitary, self, but, to, enact, different, kinds, of, selves, and, different, linguistic, contexts, create, different, kinds, of, self, expression, and, experiences, for, the, same, person, however, there, has, been, little, rigorous, research, done, on, this, topic, and, it, is, difficult, to, define, personality, in, this, context, fran, ois, grosjean, wrote, what, is, seen, as, a, change, in, personality, is, most, probably, simply, a, shift, in, attitudes, and, behaviors, that, correspond, to, a, shift, in, situation, or, context, independent, of, language, however, the, sapir, whorf, hypothesis, which, states, that, a, language, shapes, our, vision, of, the, world, may, suggest, that, a, language, learned, by, a, grown, up, may, have, much, fewer, emotional, connotations, and, therefore, allow, a, more, serene, discussion, than, a, language, learned, by, a, child, and, to, that, respect, more, or, less, bound, to, a, child, s, perception, of, the, world, many, polyglots, know, up, to, five, or, six, languages, but, the, frequency, of, polyglotism, drops, off, sharply, past, this, point, those, who, know, more, languages, than, five, or, six, michael, erard, suggests, eleven, or, more, while, usman, w, chohan, suggests, six, to, eight, depending, on, proficiency, or, more, are, sometimes, classed, as, hyperpolyglots, giuseppe, caspar, mezzofanti, for, example, was, an, italian, priest, reputed, to, have, spoken, anywhere, from, 30, to, 72, languages, the, term, savant, in, a, general, sense, may, refer, to, any, individual, with, a, natural, or, innate, talent, for, a, particular, field, however, people, diagnosed, with, savant, syndrome, are, specifically, individuals, with, significant, mental, disabilities, who, demonstrate, certain, profound, and, prodigious, capacities, or, certain, abilities, far, in, excess, of, what, would, usually, be, considered, normal, occasionally, including, a, prodigious, capacity, for, languages, savant, syndrome, is, almost, always, associated, with, an, increased, memory, capacity, of, some, sort, which, can, for, certain, savants, aid, in, storing, and, retrieving, knowledge, of, different, languages, in, 1991, for, example, linguists, neil, smith, and, ianthi, maria, tsimpli, described, a, man, named, christopher, who, learned, sixteen, languages, even, with, a, non, verbal, iq, between, 40, and, 70, christopher, was, born, in, 1962, and, he, was, diagnosed, with, brain, damage, approximately, six, months, after, his, birth, despite, being, institutionalized, because, he, was, unable, to, take, care, of, himself, christopher, had, a, verbal, iq, of, 89, could, speak, english, with, no, impairment, and, could, learn, subsequent, languages, with, apparent, ease, this, facility, with, language, and, communication, is, considered, to, be, unusual, for, most, diagnosed, with, savant, syndrome, widespread, multilingualism, is, one, form, of, language, contact, multilingualism, was, common, in, the, past, in, early, times, when, most, people, were, members, of, small, language, communities, it, was, necessary, to, know, two, or, more, languages, for, trade, or, any, other, dealings, outside, one, s, town, or, village, and, this, holds, good, today, in, places, of, high, linguistic, diversity, such, as, sub, saharan, africa, and, india, linguist, ekkehard, wolff, estimates, that, 50, of, the, population, of, africa, is, multilingual, in, multilingual, societies, not, all, speakers, need, to, be, multilingual, some, states, can, have, multilingual, policies, and, recognize, several, official, languages, such, as, canada, english, and, french, in, some, states, particular, languages, may, be, associated, with, particular, regions, in, the, state, e, g, canada, or, with, particular, ethnicities, e, g, malaysia, and, singapore, when, all, speakers, are, multilingual, linguists, classify, the, community, according, to, the, functional, distribution, of, the, languages, involved, note, that, the, terms, given, above, all, refer, to, situations, describing, only, two, languages, in, cases, of, an, unspecified, number, of, languages, the, terms, polyglossia, omnilingualism, and, multipart, lingualism, are, more, appropriate, taxell, s, paradox, refers, to, the, notion, that, monolingual, solutions, are, essential, to, the, realization, of, functional, bilingualism, with, multilingual, solutions, ultimately, leading, to, monolingualism, the, theory, is, based, on, the, observation, of, the, swedish, language, in, finland, in, environments, such, as, schools, is, subordinated, to, the, majority, language, finnish, for, practical, and, social, reasons, despite, the, positive, characteristics, associated, with, mutual, language, learning, whenever, two, people, meet, negotiations, take, place, if, they, want, to, express, solidarity, and, sympathy, they, tend, to, seek, common, features, in, their, behavior, if, speakers, wish, to, express, distance, towards, or, even, dislike, of, the, person, they, are, speaking, to, the, reverse, is, true, and, differences, are, sought, this, mechanism, also, extends, to, language, as, described, by, the, communication, accommodation, theory, some, multilingual, people, use, code, switching, which, involves, swapping, between, languages, in, many, cases, code, switching, allows, speakers, to, participate, in, more, than, one, cultural, group, or, environment, code, switching, may, also, function, as, a, strategy, where, proficiency, is, lacking, such, strategies, are, common, if, the, vocabulary, of, one, of, the, languages, is, not, very, elaborated, for, certain, fields, or, if, the, speakers, have, not, developed, proficiency, in, certain, lexical, domains, as, in, the, case, of, immigrant, languages, this, code, switching, appears, in, many, forms, if, a, speaker, has, a, positive, attitude, towards, both, languages, and, towards, code, switching, many, switches, can, be, found, even, within, the, same, sentence, if, however, the, speaker, is, reluctant, to, use, code, switching, as, in, the, case, of, a, lack, of, proficiency, he, might, knowingly, or, unknowingly, try, to, camouflage, his, attempt, by, converting, elements, of, one, language, into, elements, of, the, other, language, through, calquing, this, results, in, speakers, using, terms, like, courrier, noir, literally, mail, that, is, black, in, french, instead, of, the, proper, word, for, blackmail, in, french, chantage, sometimes, pidgins, develop, a, pidgin, is, a, fusion, of, two, or, more, languages, that, is, grammatically, simplified, but, can, be, understood, by, native, speakers, of, any, of, the, original, languages, some, pidgins, develop, into, real, creole, languages, such, as, papiamento, in, cura, ao, or, singlish, in, singapore, while, others, simply, evolve, into, slangs, or, jargons, such, as, helsinki, slang, which, remains, more, or, less, mutually, intelligible, with, standard, finnish, and, swedish, in, other, cases, prolonged, influence, of, languages, on, each, other, may, have, the, effect, of, changing, one, or, both, of, them, to, the, point, a, new, non, creole, language, is, born, for, example, many, linguists, believe, that, the, occitan, language, and, the, catalan, language, were, formed, because, a, population, speaking, a, single, occitano, romance, language, was, divided, by, the, political, spheres, of, influence, of, france, and, spain, respectively, yiddish, is, a, complex, blend, of, middle, high, german, with, hebrew, and, also, has, borrowings, from, slavic, languages, bilingual, interaction, can, even, take, place, without, speakers, switching, between, languages, or, fusing, them, together, in, certain, areas, it, is, not, uncommon, for, speakers, to, use, a, different, language, within, the, same, conversation, this, phenomenon, is, found, amongst, other, places, in, scandinavia, most, speakers, of, swedish, norwegian, and, danish, can, communicate, with, each, other, speaking, their, respective, languages, while, few, can, speak, both, people, used, to, these, situations, often, adjust, their, language, avoiding, words, that, are, not, found, in, the, other, language, or, that, can, be, misunderstood, using, different, languages, is, usually, called, non, convergent, discourse, a, term, introduced, by, the, dutch, linguist, reitze, jonkman, to, a, certain, extent, this, situation, also, exists, between, dutch, and, afrikaans, although, everyday, contact, is, fairly, rare, because, of, the, distance, between, the, two, respective, communities, another, example, is, the, former, state, of, czechoslovakia, where, two, closely, related, and, mutually, intelligible, languages, czech, and, slovak, were, in, common, use, most, czechs, and, slovaks, understand, both, languages, although, they, would, use, only, one, of, them, their, respective, mother, tongue, when, speaking, for, example, in, czechoslovakia, it, was, common, to, hear, two, people, talking, on, television, each, speaking, a, different, language, without, any, difficulty, understanding, each, other, this, bilingualism, still, exists, nowadays, although, it, has, started, to, deteriorate, since, czechoslovakia, split, up, with, emerging, markets, and, expanding, international, cooperation, business, users, expect, to, be, able, to, use, software, and, applications, in, their, own, language, multilingualisation, or, m17n, where, 17, stands, for, 17, omitted, letters, of, computer, systems, can, be, considered, part, of, a, continuum, between, internationalization, and, localization, translating, the, user, interface, is, usually, part, of, the, software, localization, process, which, also, includes, adaptations, such, as, units, and, date, conversion, many, software, applications, are, available, in, several, languages, ranging, from, a, handful, the, most, spoken, languages, to, dozens, for, the, most, popular, applications, such, as, office, suites, web, browsers, etc, due, to, the, status, of, english, in, computing, software, development, nearly, always, uses, it, but, see, also, non, english, based, programming, languages, so, almost, all, commercial, software, is, initially, available, in, an, english, version, and, multilingual, versions, if, any, may, be, produced, as, alternative, options, based, on, the, english, original, the, multilingual, app, toolkit, mat, was, first, released, in, concert, with, the, release, of, windows, 8, as, a, way, to, provide, developers, a, set, of, free, tooling, that, enabled, adding, languages, to, their, apps, with, just, a, few, clicks, in, large, part, due, to, the, integration, of, a, free, unlimited, license, to, both, the, microsoft, translator, machine, translation, service, and, the, microsoft, language, platform, service, along, with, platform, extensibility, to, enable, anyone, to, add, translation, services, into, mat, microsoft, engineers, and, inventors, of, mat, jan, a, nelson, and, camerum, lerum, have, continued, to, drive, the, development, of, the, tools, working, with, third, parties, and, standards, bodies, to, ensure, that, broad, availability, of, multilingual, app, development, is, provided, with, the, release, of, windows, 10, mat, is, now, delivering, support, for, cross, platform, development, for, universal, windows, platform, apps, as, well, as, for, ios, and, android, apps, according, to, hewitt, 2008, entrepreneurs, in, london, from, poland, china, and, turkey, tend, to, use, english, for, communication, with, customers, suppliers, and, banks, but, their, native, languages, for, work, tasks, and, other, social, purposes, even, in, english, speaking, countries, immigrants, can, often, still, use, their, mother, tongue, in, the, workplace, thanks, to, the, presence, of, other, immigrants, in, that, workplace, who, come, from, the, same, place, kovacs, 2004, describes, this, phenomenon, in, australia, with, finnish, immigrants, in, the, construction, industry, who, spoke, finnish, during, working, hours, although, foreign, languages, may, be, used, in, the, workplace, english, is, still, a, key, working, skill, many, asian, companies, due, to, increasing, globalization, have, recently, been, focusing, more, and, more, on, their, employees, english, proficiency, especially, in, south, korea, since, the, 1990s, asian, companies, have, lately, used, different, english, language, tests, to, evaluate, job, applicants, and, the, standards, for, these, tests, continue, to, be, raised, meanwhile, japan, ranks, 53rd, out, of, 100, countries, in, 2019, ef, english, proficiency, index, amid, calls, for, this, to, improve, in,

degrees, of, fluency, some, are, proficient, in, several, chinese, varieties, given, the, linguistic, diversity, of, the, ethnic, chinese, community, in, both, countries, in, singapore, bilingualism, is, embraced, in, the, education, system, with, english, as, the, medium, of, instruction, and, the, official, mother, tongue, taught, as, a, second, language, in, africa, knowledge, of, english, is, important, not, only, for, multinational, companies, but, also, in, the, fields, of, engineering, chemistry, electricity, and, aeronautics, a, study, directed, by, hill, and, van, zyl, 2002, shows, that, in, south, africa, young, black, engineers, used, english, most, often, for, communication, and, documentation, however, afrikaans, and, other, local, languages, were, also, used, to, explain, particular, concepts, to, workers, in, order, to, ensure, understanding, and, cooperation, languages, that, are, used, in, multiple, countries, include, english, is, a, commonly, taught, second, language, at, schools, so, it, is, also, the, most, common, choice, for, two, speakers, whose, native, languages, are, different, however, some, languages, are, so, close, to, each, other, that, it, is, generally, more, common, when, meeting, to, use, their, mother, tongue, rather, than, english, these, language, groups, include, in, multilingual, countries, such, as, belgium, dutch, french, and,
