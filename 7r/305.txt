an, adverb, is, a, word, or, an, expression, that, generally, modifies, a, verb, an, adjective, another, adverb, a, determiner, a, clause, a, preposition, or, a, sentence, adverbs, typically, express, manner, place, time, frequency, degree, or, level, of, certainty, by, answering, questions, such, as, how, in, what, way, when, where, to, what, extent, this, is, called, the, adverbial, function, and, may, be, performed, by, an, individual, adverb, by, an, adverbial, phrase, or, by, an, adverbial, clause, adverbs, are, traditionally, regarded, as, one, of, the, parts, of, speech, modern, linguists, note, that, the, term, adverb, has, come, to, be, used, as, a, kind, of, catch, all, category, used, to, classify, words, with, various, types, of, syntactic, behavior, not, necessarily, having, much, in, common, except, that, they, do, not, fit, into, any, of, the, other, available, categories, noun, adjective, preposition, etc, the, english, word, adverb, derives, through, french, from, latin, adverbium, from, ad, to, verbum, word, verb, and, the, nominal, suffix, ium, the, term, implies, that, the, principal, function, of, adverbs, is, to, act, as, modifiers, of, verbs, or, verb, phrases, an, adverb, used, in, this, way, may, provide, information, about, the, manner, place, time, frequency, certainty, or, other, circumstances, of, the, activity, denoted, by, the, verb, or, verb, phrase, some, examples, adverbs, can, also, be, used, as, modifiers, of, adjectives, and, of, other, adverbs, often, to, indicate, degree, examples, they, can, also, modify, determiners, prepositional, phrases, or, whole, clauses, or, sentences, as, in, the, following, examples, adverbs, thus, perform, a, wide, range, of, modifying, functions, the, major, exception, is, the, function, of, modifier, of, nouns, which, is, performed, instead, by, adjectives, compare, she, sang, loudly, with, her, loud, singing, disturbed, me, here, the, verb, sang, is, modified, by, the, adverb, loudly, whereas, the, noun, singing, is, modified, by, the, adjective, loud, however, because, some, adverbs, and, adjectives, are, homonyms, their, respective, functions, are, sometimes, conflated, the, word, even, in, the, first, sentence, is, an, adjective, since, it, is, a, prepositive, modifier, that, modifies, the, noun, numbers, the, word, even, in, the, second, sentence, is, a, prepositive, adverb, that, modifies, the, verb, drank, although, it, is, possible, for, an, adverb, to, precede, or, to, follow, a, noun, or, a, noun, phrase, the, adverb, nonetheless, does, not, modify, either, in, such, cases, as, in, in, the, first, sentence, internationally, is, a, prepositive, adverb, that, modifies, the, clause, there, is, in, the, second, sentence, internationally, is, a, postpositive, adverb, that, modifies, the, clause, there, is, by, contrast, the, third, sentence, contains, international, as, a, prepositive, adjective, that, modifies, the, noun, shortage, adverbs, can, sometimes, be, used, as, predicative, expressions, in, english, this, applies, especially, to, adverbs, of, location, when, the, function, of, an, adverb, is, performed, by, an, expression, consisting, of, more, than, one, word, it, is, called, an, adverbial, phrase, or, adverbial, clause, or, simply, an, adverbial, in, english, adverbs, of, manner, answering, the, question, how, are, often, formed, by, adding, ly, to, adjectives, but, flat, adverbs, such, as, in, drive, fast, drive, slow, and, drive, friendly, have, the, same, form, as, the, corresponding, adjective, other, languages, often, have, similar, methods, for, deriving, adverbs, from, adjectives, french, for, example, uses, the, suffix, ment, or, else, use, the, same, form, for, both, adjectives, and, adverbs, as, in, german, and, dutch, where, for, example, schnell, or, snel, respectively, mean, either, quick, or, quickly, depending, on, the, context, many, other, adverbs, however, are, not, related, to, adjectives, in, this, way, they, may, be, derived, from, other, words, or, phrases, or, may, be, single, morphemes, examples, of, such, adverbs, in, english, include, here, there, together, yesterday, aboard, very, almost, etc, where, the, meaning, permits, adverbs, may, undergo, comparison, taking, comparative, and, superlative, forms, in, english, this, is, usually, done, by, adding, more, and, most, before, the, adverb, more, slowly, most, slowly, although, there, are, a, few, adverbs, that, take, inflected, forms, such, as, well, for, which, better, and, best, are, used, for, more, information, about, the, formation, and, use, of, adverbs, in, english, see, english, adverbs, for, other, languages, see, in, specific, languages, below, and, the, articles, on, individual, languages, and, their, grammars, adverbs, are, considered, a, part, of, speech, in, traditional, english, grammar, and, are, still, included, as, a, part, of, speech, in, grammar, taught, in, schools, and, used, in, dictionaries, however, modern, grammarians, recognize, that, words, traditionally, grouped, together, as, adverbs, serve, a, number, of, different, functions, some, describe, adverbs, as, a, catch, all, category, that, includes, all, words, that, do, not, belong, to, one, of, the, other, parts, of, speech, a, logical, approach, to, dividing, words, into, classes, relies, on, recognizing, which, words, can, be, used, in, a, certain, context, for, example, the, only, type, of, word, that, can, be, inserted, in, the, following, template, to, form, a, grammatical, sentence, is, a, noun, when, this, approach, is, taken, it, is, seen, that, adverbs, fall, into, a, number, of, different, categories, for, example, some, adverbs, can, be, used, to, modify, an, entire, sentence, whereas, others, cannot, even, when, a, sentential, adverb, has, other, functions, the, meaning, is, often, not, the, same, for, example, in, the, sentences, she, gave, birth, naturally, and, naturally, she, gave, birth, the, word, naturally, has, different, meanings, in, the, first, sentence, as, a, verb, modifying, adverb, it, means, in, a, natural, manner, while, in, the, second, sentence, as, a, sentential, adverb, it, means, something, like, of, course, words, like, very, afford, another, example, we, can, say, perry, is, very, fast, but, not, perry, very, won, the, race, these, words, can, modify, adjectives, but, not, verbs, on, the, other, hand, there, are, words, like, here, and, there, that, cannot, modify, adjectives, we, can, say, the, sock, looks, good, there, but, not, it, is, a, there, beautiful, sock, the, fact, that, many, adverbs, can, be, used, in, more, than, one, of, these, functions, can, confuse, the, issue, and, it, may, seem, like, splitting, hairs, to, say, that, a, single, adverb, is, really, two, or, more, words, that, serve, different, functions, however, this, distinction, can, be, useful, especially, when, considering, adverbs, like, naturally, that, have, different, meanings, in, their, different, functions, rodney, huddleston, distinguishes, between, a, word, and, a, lexicogrammatical, word, grammarians, find, difficulty, categorizing, negating, words, such, as, the, english, not, although, traditionally, listed, as, an, adverb, this, word, does, not, behave, grammatically, like, any, other, and, it, probably, should, be, placed, in, a, class, of, its, own
