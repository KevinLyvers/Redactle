animal, welfare, is, the, well, being, of, non, human, animals, formal, standards, of, animal, welfare, vary, between, contexts, but, are, debated, mostly, by, animal, welfare, groups, legislators, and, academics, animal, welfare, science, uses, measures, such, as, longevity, disease, immunosuppression, behavior, physiology, and, reproduction, although, there, is, debate, about, which, of, these, best, indicate, animal, welfare, respect, for, animal, welfare, is, often, based, on, the, belief, that, nonhuman, animals, are, sentient, and, that, consideration, should, be, given, to, their, well, being, or, suffering, especially, when, they, are, under, the, care, of, humans, these, concerns, can, include, how, animals, are, slaughtered, for, food, how, they, are, used, in, scientific, research, how, they, are, kept, as, pets, in, zoos, farms, circuses, etc, and, how, human, activities, affect, the, welfare, and, survival, of, wild, species, there, are, two, forms, of, criticism, of, the, concept, of, animal, welfare, coming, from, diametrically, opposite, positions, one, view, held, by, some, thinkers, in, history, holds, that, humans, have, no, duties, of, any, kind, to, animals, the, other, view, is, based, on, the, animal, rights, position, that, animals, should, not, be, regarded, as, property, and, any, use, of, animals, by, humans, is, unacceptable, accordingly, some, animal, rights, proponents, argue, that, the, perception, of, better, animal, welfare, facilitates, continued, and, increased, exploitation, of, animals, some, authorities, therefore, treat, animal, welfare, and, animal, rights, as, two, opposing, positions, others, see, animal, welfare, gains, as, incremental, steps, towards, animal, rights, the, predominant, view, of, modern, neuroscientists, notwithstanding, philosophical, problems, with, the, definition, of, consciousness, even, in, humans, is, that, consciousness, exists, in, nonhuman, animals, however, some, still, maintain, that, consciousness, is, a, philosophical, question, that, may, never, be, scientifically, resolved, remarkably, a, new, study, has, managed, to, overcome, some, of, the, difficulties, in, testing, this, question, empirically, and, devised, a, unique, way, to, dissociate, conscious, from, nonconscious, perception, in, animals, in, this, study, conducted, in, rhesus, monkeys, the, researchers, built, experiments, predicting, completely, opposite, behavioral, outcomes, to, consciously, vs, non, consciously, perceived, stimuli, strikingly, the, monkeys, behaviors, displayed, these, exact, opposite, signatures, just, like, aware, and, unaware, humans, tested, in, the, study, animal, protection, laws, were, enacted, as, early, as, the, 1st, millennium, bce, in, india, several, indian, kings, built, hospitals, for, animals, and, emperor, ashoka, 304, 232, bce, issued, orders, against, hunting, and, animal, slaughter, in, line, with, ahimsa, the, doctrine, of, non, violence, in, the, 13th, century, ce, genghis, khan, protected, wildlife, in, mongolia, during, the, breeding, season, march, to, october, early, legislation, in, the, western, world, on, behalf, of, animals, includes, the, ireland, parliament, thomas, wentworth, an, act, against, plowing, by, the, tayle, and, pulling, the, wooll, off, living, sheep, 1635, and, the, massachusetts, colony, nathaniel, ward, off, the, bruite, creatures, liberty, 92, and, 93, in, the, massachusetts, body, of, liberties, of, 1641, in, 1776, english, clergyman, humphrey, primatt, authored, a, dissertation, on, the, duty, of, mercy, and, sin, of, cruelty, to, brute, animals, one, of, the, first, books, published, in, support, of, animal, welfare, marc, bekoff, said, that, primatt, was, largely, responsible, for, bringing, animal, welfare, to, the, attention, of, the, general, public, since, 1822, when, irish, mp, richard, martin, brought, the, cruel, treatment, of, cattle, act, 1822, through, parliament, offering, protection, from, cruelty, to, cattle, horses, and, sheep, an, animal, welfare, movement, has, been, active, in, england, martin, was, among, the, founders, of, the, world, s, first, animal, welfare, organization, the, society, for, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, or, spca, in, 1824, in, 1840, queen, victoria, gave, the, society, her, blessing, and, it, became, the, rspca, the, society, used, members, donations, to, employ, a, growing, network, of, inspectors, whose, job, was, to, identify, abusers, gather, evidence, and, report, them, to, the, authorities, in, 1837, the, german, minister, albert, knapp, founded, the, first, german, animal, welfare, society, one, of, the, first, national, laws, to, protect, animals, was, the, uk, cruelty, to, animals, act, 1835, followed, by, the, protection, of, animals, act, 1911, in, the, us, it, was, many, years, until, there, was, a, national, law, to, protect, animals, the, animal, welfare, act, of, 1966, although, there, were, a, number, of, states, that, passed, anti, cruelty, laws, between, 1828, and, 1898, in, india, animals, are, protected, by, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, act, 1960, significant, progress, in, animal, welfare, did, not, take, place, until, the, late, 20th, century, in, 1965, the, uk, government, commissioned, an, investigation, led, by, professor, roger, brambell, into, the, welfare, of, intensively, farmed, animals, partly, in, response, to, concerns, raised, in, ruth, harrison, s, 1964, book, animal, machines, on, the, basis, of, brambell, s, report, the, uk, government, set, up, the, farm, animal, welfare, advisory, committee, in, 1967, which, became, the, farm, animal, welfare, council, in, 1979, the, committee, s, first, guidelines, recommended, that, animals, require, the, freedom, to, stand, up, lie, down, turn, around, groom, themselves, and, stretch, their, limbs, the, guidelines, have, since, been, elaborated, upon, to, become, known, as, the, five, freedoms, in, the, uk, the, animal, welfare, act, 2006, consolidated, many, different, forms, of, animal, welfare, legislation, a, number, of, animal, welfare, organisations, are, campaigning, to, achieve, a, universal, declaration, on, animal, welfare, udaw, at, the, united, nations, in, principle, the, universal, declaration, would, call, on, the, united, nations, to, recognise, animals, as, sentient, beings, capable, of, experiencing, pain, and, suffering, and, to, recognise, that, animal, welfare, is, an, issue, of, importance, as, part, of, the, social, development, of, nations, worldwide, the, campaign, to, achieve, the, udaw, is, being, coordinated, by, world, animal, protection, with, a, core, working, group, including, compassion, in, world, farming, the, rspca, and, the, humane, society, international, the, international, branch, of, hsus, the, 2019, un, global, sustainable, development, report, identified, animal, welfare, as, one, of, several, key, missing, issues, in, the, 2030, agenda, for, sustainable, development, animal, welfare, science, is, an, emerging, field, that, seeks, to, answer, questions, raised, by, the, keeping, and, use, of, animals, such, as, whether, hens, are, frustrated, when, confined, in, cages, whether, the, psychological, well, being, of, animals, in, laboratories, can, be, maintained, and, whether, zoo, animals, are, stressed, by, the, transport, required, for, international, conservation, ireland, leads, research, into, farm, animal, welfare, with, the, recently, published, research, report, on, farm, animal, welfare, archived, 8, may, 2019, at, the, wayback, machine, a, major, concern, for, the, welfare, of, farmed, animals, is, factory, farming, in, which, large, numbers, of, animals, are, reared, in, confinement, at, high, stocking, densities, issues, include, the, limited, opportunities, for, natural, behaviors, for, example, in, battery, cages, veal, and, gestation, crates, instead, producing, abnormal, behaviors, such, as, tail, biting, cannibalism, and, feather, pecking, and, routine, invasive, procedures, such, as, beak, trimming, castration, and, ear, notching, more, extensive, methods, of, farming, e, g, free, range, can, also, raise, welfare, concerns, such, as, the, mulesing, of, sheep, and, predation, of, stock, by, wild, animals, biosecurity, is, also, a, risk, with, free, range, farming, as, it, allows, for, more, contact, between, livestock, and, wild, animal, populations, which, may, carry, zoonoses, farmed, animals, are, artificially, selected, for, production, parameters, which, sometimes, impinge, on, the, animals, welfare, for, example, broiler, chickens, are, bred, to, be, very, large, to, produce, the, greatest, quantity, of, meat, per, animal, broilers, bred, for, fast, growth, have, a, high, incidence, of, leg, deformities, because, the, large, breast, muscles, cause, distortions, of, the, developing, legs, and, pelvis, and, the, birds, cannot, support, their, increased, body, weight, as, a, consequence, they, frequently, become, lame, or, suffer, from, broken, legs, the, increased, body, weight, also, puts, a, strain, on, their, hearts, and, lungs, and, ascites, often, develop, in, the, uk, alone, up, to, 20, million, broilers, each, year, die, from, the, stress, of, catching, and, transporting, before, reaching, the, slaughterhouse, animal, welfare, violations, have, been, observed, more, in, intensively, bred, chicken, pig, and, cattle, species, respectively, and, studies, and, laws, have, been, enacted, in, this, regard, however, animal, welfare, in, semi, intensive, species, such, as, sheep, and, goats, is, nowadays, being, scrutinised, and, gaining, importance, another, concern, about, the, welfare, of, farmed, animals, is, the, method, of, slaughter, especially, ritual, slaughter, while, the, killing, of, animals, need, not, necessarily, involve, suffering, the, general, public, considers, that, killing, an, animal, reduces, its, welfare, this, leads, to, further, concerns, about, premature, slaughtering, such, as, chick, culling, by, the, laying, hen, industry, in, which, males, are, slaughtered, immediately, after, hatching, because, they, are, superfluous, this, policy, occurs, in, other, farmed, animal, industries, such, as, the, production, of, goat, and, cattle, milk, raising, the, same, concerns, a, 2023, report, by, the, animal, welfare, institute, found, that, animal, welfare, claims, by, companies, selling, meat, and, poultry, products, lack, adequate, substantiation, in, roughly, 85, of, analyzed, cases, captive, cetaceans, are, kept, for, display, research, and, naval, operations, to, enhance, their, welfare, humans, feed, them, fish, that, are, dead, but, are, disease, free, protect, them, from, predators, and, injury, monitor, their, health, and, provide, activities, for, behavioral, enrichment, some, are, kept, in, lagoons, with, natural, soil, and, vegetated, sides, most, are, in, concrete, tanks, which, are, easy, to, clean, but, echo, their, natural, sounds, back, to, them, they, cannot, develop, their, own, social, groups, and, related, cetaceans, are, typically, separated, for, display, and, breeding, military, dolphins, used, in, naval, operations, swim, free, during, operations, and, training, and, return, to, pens, otherwise, captive, cetaceans, are, trained, to, present, themselves, for, blood, samples, health, exams, and, noninvasive, breath, samples, above, their, blow, holes, staff, can, monitor, the, captives, afterward, for, signs, of, infection, from, the, procedure, research, on, wild, cetaceans, leaves, them, free, to, roam, and, make, sounds, in, their, natural, habitat, eat, live, fish, face, predators, and, injury, and, form, social, groups, voluntarily, however, boat, engines, of, researchers, whale, watchers, and, others, add, substantial, noise, to, their, natural, environment, reducing, their, ability, to, echolocate, and, communicate, electric, engines, are, far, quieter, but, are, not, widely, used, for, either, research, or, whale, watching, even, for, maintaining, position, which, does, not, require, much, power, vancouver, port, offers, discounts, for, ships, with, quiet, propeller, and, hull, designs, other, areas, have, reduced, speeds, boat, engines, also, have, unshielded, propellers, which, cause, serious, injuries, to, cetaceans, who, come, close, to, the, propeller, the, us, coast, guard, has, proposed, rules, on, propeller, guards, to, protect, human, swimmers, but, has, not, adopted, any, rules, the, us, navy, uses, propeller, guards, to, protect, manatees, in, georgia, ducted, propellers, provide, more, efficient, drive, at, speeds, up, to, 10, knots, and, protect, animals, beneath, and, beside, them, but, need, grilles, to, prevent, injuries, to, animals, drawn, into, the, duct, attaching, satellite, trackers, and, obtaining, biopsies, to, measure, pollution, loads, and, dna, involve, either, capture, and, release, or, shooting, the, cetaceans, from, a, distance, with, dart, guns, a, cetacean, was, killed, by, a, fungal, infection, after, being, darted, due, to, either, an, incompletely, sterilized, dart, or, an, infection, from, the, ocean, entering, the, wound, caused, by, the, dart, researchers, on, wild, cetaceans, have, not, yet, been, able, to, use, drones, to, capture, noninvasive, breath, samples, other, harms, to, wild, cetaceans, include, commercial, whaling, aboriginal, whaling, drift, netting, ship, collisions, water, pollution, noise, from, sonar, and, reflection, seismology, predators, loss, of, prey, and, disease, efforts, to, enhance, the, life, of, wild, cetaceans, besides, reducing, those, harms, include, offering, human, music, canadian, rules, do, not, forbid, playing, quiet, music, though, they, forbid, noise, that, may, resemble, whale, songs, or, calls, underwater, in, addition, to, cetaceans, the, welfare, of, other, wild, animals, has, also, been, studied, though, to, a, lesser, extent, than, that, of, animals, in, farms, research, in, wild, animal, welfare, has, two, focuses, the, welfare, of, wild, animals, kept, in, captivity, and, the, welfare, of, animals, living, in, the, wild, the, former, has, addressed, the, situation, of, animals, kept, both, for, human, use, as, in, zoos, or, circuses, or, in, rehabilitation, centers, the, latter, has, examined, how, the, welfare, of, non, domesticated, animals, living, in, wild, or, urban, areas, are, affected, by, humans, or, natural, factors, causing, wild, animal, suffering, some, of, the, proponents, of, these, views, have, advocated, carrying, out, conservation, efforts, in, ways, that, respect, the, welfare, of, wild, animals, within, the, framework, of, the, disciplines, of, compassionate, conservation, and, conservation, welfare, while, others, have, argued, in, favor, of, improving, the, welfare, of, wild, animals, for, the, sake, of, the, animals, regardless, of, whether, there, are, any, conservation, issues, involved, at, all, the, welfare, economist, yew, kwang, ng, in, his, 1995, towards, welfare, biology, evolutionary, economics, of, animal, consciousness, and, suffering, proposed, welfare, biology, as, a, research, field, to, study, living, things, and, their, environment, with, respect, to, their, welfare, defined, as, net, happiness, or, enjoyment, minus, suffering, the, european, commission, s, activities, in, this, area, start, with, the, recognition, that, animals, are, sentient, beings, the, general, aim, is, to, ensure, that, animals, do, not, endure, avoidable, pain, or, suffering, and, obliges, the, owner, keeper, of, animals, to, respect, minimum, welfare, requirements, european, union, legislation, regarding, farm, animal, welfare, is, regularly, re, drafted, according, to, science, based, evidence, and, cultural, views, for, example, in, 2009, legislation, was, passed, which, aimed, to, reduce, animal, suffering, during, slaughter, and, on, 1, january, 2012, the, european, union, council, directive, 1999, 74, ec, came, into, act, which, means, that, conventional, battery, cages, for, laying, hens, are, now, banned, across, the, union, the, animal, welfare, act, 2006, makes, owners, and, keepers, responsible, for, ensuring, that, the, welfare, needs, of, their, animals, are, met, these, include, the, need, for, a, suitable, environment, place, to, live, for, a, suitable, diet, to, exhibit, normal, behavior, patterns, to, be, housed, with, or, apart, from, other, animals, if, applicable, and, to, be, protected, from, pain, injury, suffering, and, disease, anyone, who, is, cruel, to, an, animal, or, does, not, provide, for, its, welfare, needs, may, be, banned, from, owning, animals, fined, up, to, 20, 000, and, or, sent, to, prison, for, a, maximum, of, six, months, in, the, uk, the, welfare, of, research, animals, being, used, for, regulated, procedures, was, historically, protected, by, the, animals, scientific, procedures, act, 1986, aspa, which, is, administrated, by, the, home, office, the, act, defines, regulated, procedures, as, animal, experiments, that, could, potentially, cause, pain, suffering, distress, or, lasting, harm, to, protected, animals, initially, protected, animals, encompassed, all, living, vertebrates, other, than, humans, but, in, 1993, an, amendment, added, a, single, invertebrate, species, the, common, octopus, primates, cats, dogs, and, horses, have, additional, protection, over, other, vertebrates, under, the, act, revised, legislation, came, into, force, in, january, 2013, this, has, been, expanded, to, protect, all, living, vertebrates, other, than, man, and, any, living, cephalopod, fish, and, amphibia, are, protected, once, they, can, feed, independently, and, cephalopods, at, the, point, when, they, hatch, embryonic, and, foetal, forms, of, mammals, birds, and, reptiles, are, protected, during, the, last, third, of, their, gestation, or, incubation, period, the, definition, of, regulated, procedures, was, also, expanded, a, procedure, is, regulated, if, it, is, carried, out, on, a, protected, animal, and, may, cause, that, animal, a, level, of, pain, suffering, distress, or, lasting, harm, equivalent, to, or, higher, than, that, caused, by, inserting, a, hypodermic, needle, according, to, good, veterinary, practice, it, also, includes, modifying, the, genes, of, a, protected, animal, if, this, causes, the, animal, pain, suffering, distress, or, lasting, harm, the, aspa, also, considers, other, issues, such, as, animal, sources, housing, conditions, identification, methods, and, the, humane, killing, of, animals, those, applying, for, a, license, must, explain, why, such, research, cannot, be, done, through, non, animal, methods, the, project, must, also, pass, an, ethical, review, panel, which, aims, to, decide, if, the, potential, benefits, outweigh, any, suffering, for, the, animals, involved, in, the, united, states, a, federal, law, called, the, humane, slaughter, act, was, designed, to, decrease, suffering, of, livestock, during, slaughter, the, georgia, animal, protection, act, of, 1986, was, a, state, law, enacted, in, response, to, the, inhumane, treatment, of, companion, animals, by, a, pet, store, chain, in, atlanta, the, act, provided, for, the, licensing, and, regulation, of, pet, shops, stables, kennels, and, animal, shelters, and, established, for, the, first, time, minimum, standards, of, care, additional, provisions, called, the, humane, euthanasia, act, were, added, in, 1990, and, then, further, expanded, and, strengthened, with, the, animal, protection, act, of, 2000, in, 2002, voters, passed, by, a, margin, of, 55, for, and, 45, against, amendment, 10, to, the, florida, constitution, banning, the, confinement, of, pregnant, pigs, in, gestation, crates, in, 2006, arizona, voters, passed, proposition, 204, with, 62, support, the, legislation, prohibits, the, confinement, of, calves, in, veal, crates, and, breeding, sows, in, gestation, crates, in, 2007, the, governor, of, oregon, signed, legislation, prohibiting, the, confinement, of, pigs, in, gestation, crates, and, in, 2008, the, governor, of, colorado, signed, legislation, that, phased, out, both, gestation, crates, and, veal, crates, also, during, 2008, california, passed, proposition, 2, known, as, the, prevention, of, farm, animal, cruelty, act, which, orders, new, space, requirements, for, farm, animals, starting, in, 2015, in, the, us, every, institution, that, uses, vertebrate, animals, for, federally, funded, laboratory, research, must, have, an, institutional, animal, care, and, use, committee, iacuc, each, local, iacuc, reviews, research, protocols, and, conducts, evaluations, of, the, institution, s, animal, care, and, use, which, includes, the, results, of, inspections, of, facilities, that, are, required, by, law, the, iacuc, committee, must, assess, the, steps, taken, to, enhance, animal, well, being, before, research, can, take, place, this, includes, research, on, farm, animals, according, to, the, national, institutes, of, health, office, of, laboratory, animal, welfare, researchers, must, try, to, minimize, distress, in, animals, whenever, possible, animals, used, in, research, and, testing, may, experience, pain, from, induced, diseases, procedures, and, toxicity, the, public, health, service, phs, policy, and, animal, welfare, regulations, awrs, state, that, procedures, that, cause, more, than, momentary, or, slight, pain, or, distress, should, be, performed, with, appropriate, sedation, analgesia, or, anesthesia, however, research, and, testing, studies, sometimes, involve, pain, that, cannot, be, relieved, with, such, agents, because, they, would, interfere, with, the, scientific, objectives, of, the, study, accordingly, federal, regulations, require, that, iacucs, determine, that, discomfort, to, animals, will, be, limited, to, that, which, is, unavoidable, for, the, conduct, of, scientifically, valuable, research, and, that, unrelieved, pain, and, distress, will, only, continue, for, the, duration, necessary, to, accomplish, the, scientific, objectives, the, phs, policy, and, awrs, further, state, that, animals, that, would, otherwise, suffer, severe, or, chronic, pain, and, distress, that, cannot, be, relieved, should, be, painlessly, killed, at, the, end, of, the, procedure, or, if, appropriate, during, the, procedure, the, national, research, council, s, guide, for, the, care, and, use, of, laboratory, animals, also, serves, as, a, guide, to, improve, welfare, for, animals, used, in, research, in, the, us, the, federation, of, animal, science, societies, guide, for, the, care, and, use, of, agricultural, animals, in, research, and, teaching, is, a, resource, addressing, welfare, concerns, in, farm, animal, research, laboratory, animals, in, the, us, are, also, protected, under, the, animal, welfare, act, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, animal, and, plant, health, inspection, service, aphis, enforces, the, animal, welfare, act, aphis, inspects, animal, research, facilities, regularly, and, reports, are, published, online, according, to, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, usda, the, total, number, of, animals, used, in, the, u, s, in, 2005, was, almost, 1, 2, million, but, this, does, not, include, rats, mice, and, birds, which, are, not, covered, by, welfare, legislation, but, make, up, approximately, 90, of, research, animals, there, are, many, different, approaches, to, describing, and, defining, animal, welfare, positive, conditions, providing, good, animal, welfare, is, sometimes, defined, by, a, list, of, positive, conditions, which, should, be, provided, to, the, animal, this, approach, is, taken, by, the, five, freedoms, and, the, three, principles, of, professor, john, webster, the, five, freedoms, are, john, webster, defines, animal, welfare, by, advocating, three, positive, conditions, living, a, natural, life, being, fit, and, healthy, and, being, happy, high, production, in, the, past, many, have, seen, farm, animal, welfare, chiefly, in, terms, of, whether, the, animal, is, producing, well, the, argument, is, that, an, animal, in, poor, welfare, would, not, be, producing, well, however, many, farmed, animals, will, remain, highly, productive, despite, being, in, conditions, where, good, welfare, is, almost, certainly, compromised, e, g, layer, hens, in, battery, cages, emotion, in, animals, others, in, the, field, such, as, professor, ian, duncan, and, professor, marian, dawkins, focus, more, on, the, feelings, of, the, animal, this, approach, indicates, the, belief, that, animals, should, be, considered, as, sentient, beings, duncan, wrote, animal, welfare, is, to, do, with, the, feelings, experienced, by, animals, the, absence, of, strong, negative, feelings, usually, called, suffering, and, probably, the, presence, of, positive, feelings, usually, called, pleasure, in, any, assessment, of, welfare, it, is, these, feelings, that, should, be, assessed, dawkins, wrote, let, us, not, mince, words, animal, welfare, involves, the, subjective, feelings, of, animals,

professor, donald, broom, defines, the, welfare, of, an, animal, as, its, state, as, regards, its, attempts, to, cope, with, its, environment, this, state, includes, how, much, it, is, having, to, do, to, cope, the, extent, to, which, it, is, succeeding, in, or, failing, to, cope, and, its, associated, feelings, he, states, that, welfare, will, vary, over, a, continuum, from, very, good, to, very, poor, and, studies, of, welfare, will, be, most, effective, if, a, wide, range, of, measures, is, used, john, webster, criticized, this, definition, for, making, no, attempt, to, say, what, constitutes, good, or, bad, welfare, animal, welfare, often, refers, to, a, utilitarian, attitude, towards, the, well, being, of, nonhuman, animals, it, believes, the, animals, can, be, exploited, if, the, animal, suffering, and, the, costs, of, use, is, less, than, the, benefits, to, humans, this, attitude, is, also, known, simply, as, welfarism, an, example, of, welfarist, thought, is, hugh, fearnley, whittingstall, s, meat, manifesto, point, three, of, eight, is, think, about, the, animals, that, the, meat, you, eat, comes, from, are, you, at, all, concerned, about, how, they, have, been, treated, have, they, lived, well, have, they, been, fed, on, safe, appropriate, foods, have, they, been, cared, for, by, someone, who, respects, them, and, enjoys, contact, with, them, would, you, like, to, be, sure, of, that, perhaps, it, s, time, to, find, out, a, bit, more, about, where, the, meat, you, eat, comes, from, or, to, buy, from, a, source, that, reassures, you, about, these, points, robert, garner, describes, the, welfarist, position, as, the, most, widely, held, in, modern, society, he, states, that, one, of, the, best, attempts, to, clarify, this, position, is, given, by, philosopher, robert, nozick, consider, the, following, too, minimal, position, about, the, treatment, of, animals, so, that, we, can, easily, refer, to, it, let, us, label, this, position, utilitarianism, for, animals, kantianism, for, people, it, says, 1, maximize, the, total, happiness, of, all, living, beings, 2, place, stringent, side, constraints, on, what, one, may, do, to, human, beings, human, beings, may, not, be, used, or, sacrificed, for, the, benefit, of, others, animals, may, be, used, or, sacrificed, for, the, benefit, of, other, people, or, animals, only, if, those, benefits, are, greater, than, the, loss, inflicted, welfarism, is, often, contrasted, with, the, animal, rights, and, animal, liberation, positions, which, hold, that, animals, should, not, be, used, by, humans, and, should, not, be, regarded, as, human, property, however, it, has, been, argued, that, both, welfarism, and, animal, liberation, only, make, sense, if, it, is, assumed, that, animals, have, subjective, welfare, new, welfarism, was, coined, by, gary, l, francione, in, 1996, it, is, a, view, that, the, best, way, to, prevent, animal, suffering, is, to, abolish, the, causes, of, animal, suffering, but, advancing, animal, welfare, is, a, goal, to, pursue, in, the, short, term, thus, for, instance, new, welfarists, want, to, phase, out, fur, farms, and, animal, experiments, but, in, the, short, term, they, try, to, improve, conditions, for, the, animals, in, these, systems, so, they, lobby, to, make, cages, less, constrictive, and, to, reduce, the, numbers, of, animals, used, in, laboratories, within, the, context, of, animal, research, many, scientific, organisations, believe, that, improved, animal, welfare, will, provide, improved, scientific, outcomes, if, an, animal, in, a, laboratory, is, suffering, stress, or, pain, it, could, negatively, affect, the, results, of, the, research, increased, affluence, in, many, regions, for, the, past, few, decades, afforded, consumers, the, disposable, income, to, purchase, products, from, high, welfare, systems, the, adaptation, of, more, economically, efficient, farming, systems, in, these, regions, were, at, the, expense, of, animal, welfare, and, to, the, financial, benefit, of, consumers, both, of, which, were, factors, in, driving, the, demand, for, higher, welfare, for, farm, animals, a, 2006, survey, concluded, that, a, majority, 63, of, eu, citizens, show, some, willingness, to, change, their, usual, place, of, shopping, in, order, to, be, able, to, purchase, more, animal, welfare, friendly, products, the, volume, of, scientific, research, on, animal, welfare, has, also, increased, significantly, in, some, countries, some, individuals, in, history, have, at, least, in, principle, rejected, the, view, that, humans, have, duties, of, any, kind, to, animals, augustine, of, hippo, seemed, to, take, such, a, position, in, his, writings, against, those, he, saw, as, heretics, for, we, see, and, hear, by, their, cries, that, animals, die, with, pain, although, man, disregards, this, in, a, beast, with, which, as, not, having, a, rational, soul, we, have, no, community, of, rights, animal, rights, advocates, such, as, gary, l, francione, and, tom, regan, argue, that, the, animal, welfare, position, advocating, for, the, betterment, of, the, condition, of, animals, but, without, abolishing, animal, use, is, inconsistent, in, logic, and, ethically, unacceptable, philosopher, steven, best, suggests, that, an, emphasis, on, welfarism, has, the, effect, of, legitimizing, any, human, use, of, animals, so, long, as, humans, aren, t, cruel, to, them, and, do, whatever, is, necessary, to, avoid, inflicting, unnecessary, harm, sociologist, david, nibert, writes, that, animal, welfare, reforms, usually, implemented, by, wealthier, countries, are, often, modest, and, mostly, localized, and, are, vastly, surpassed, by, the, ongoing, expansion, of, the, capitalist, driven, animal, industrial, complex, with, the, number, of, cafos, and, the, animals, to, fill, them, dramatically, increasing, along, with, growing, numbers, of, humans, consuming, animal, products, however, there, are, some, animal, right, groups, such, as, peta, which, support, animal, welfare, measures, in, the, short, term, to, alleviate, animal, suffering, until, all, animal, use, is, ended, according, to, peta, s, ingrid, newkirk, in, an, interview, with, wikinews, there, are, two, issues, in, animal, welfare, and, animal, rights, if, i, only, could, have, one, thing, it, would, be, to, end, suffering, said, newkirk, if, you, could, take, things, from, animals, and, kill, animals, all, day, long, without, causing, them, suffering, then, i, would, take, it, everybody, should, be, able, to, agree, that, animals, should, not, suffer, if, you, kill, them, or, steal, from, them, by, taking, the, fur, off, their, backs, or, take, their, eggs, whatever, but, you, shouldn, t, put, them, through, torture, to, do, that, abolitionism, holds, that, focusing, on, animal, welfare, not, only, fails, to, challenge, animal, suffering, but, may, actually, prolong, it, by, making, the, exercise, of, property, rights, over, animals, appear, less, unattractive, the, abolitionists, objective, is, to, secure, a, moral, and, legal, paradigm, shift, whereby, animals, are, no, longer, regarded, as, property, in, recent, years, documentaries, such, as, watchdominion, com, have, been, produced, exposing, the, suffering, occurring, in, animal, agriculture, facilities, that, are,
