militarism, is, the, belief, or, the, desire, of, a, government, or, a, people, that, a, state, should, maintain, a, strong, military, capability, and, to, use, it, aggressively, to, expand, national, interests, and, or, values, it, may, also, imply, the, glorification, of, the, military, and, of, the, ideals, of, a, professional, military, class, and, the, predominance, of, the, armed, forces, in, the, administration, or, policy, of, the, state, see, also, stratocracy, and, military, junta, militarism, has, been, a, significant, element, of, the, imperialist, or, expansionist, ideologies, of, many, nations, throughout, history, notable, ancient, examples, include, the, assyrian, empire, the, greek, city, state, of, sparta, the, roman, empire, the, aztec, nation, and, the, mongol, empire, examples, from, modern, times, include, the, ottoman, empire, the, kingdom, of, prussia, german, empire, third, reich, the, british, empire, the, habsburg, monarchy, the, united, states, of, america, the, first, french, empire, the, zulu, kingdom, the, empire, of, japan, the, italian, empire, under, benito, mussolini, israel, north, korea, and, the, russian, empire, soviet, union, russia, the, roots, of, german, militarism, can, be, found, in, 18th, and, 19th, century, prussia, and, the, subsequent, unification, of, germany, under, prussian, leadership, however, hans, rosenberg, sees, its, origin, already, in, the, teutonic, order, and, its, colonization, of, prussia, during, the, late, middle, ages, when, mercenaries, from, the, holy, roman, empire, were, granted, lands, by, the, order, and, gradually, formed, a, new, landed, militarist, prussian, nobility, from, which, the, junker, nobility, would, later, evolve, during, the, 17th, century, reign, of, the, great, elector, frederick, william, elector, of, brandenburg, brandenburg, prussia, increased, its, military, to, 40, 000, men, and, began, an, effective, military, administration, overseen, by, the, general, war, commissariat, in, order, to, bolster, his, power, both, in, interior, and, foreign, matters, so, called, soldatenk, nig, soldier, king, frederick, william, i, of, prussia, started, his, large, scale, military, reforms, in, 1713, thus, beginning, the, country, s, tradition, of, a, high, military, budget, by, increasing, the, annual, military, spending, to, 73, of, the, entire, annual, budget, of, prussia, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1740, the, prussian, army, had, grown, into, a, standing, army, of, 83, 000, men, one, of, the, largest, in, europe, at, a, time, when, the, entire, prussian, populace, made, up, 2, 5, million, people, prussian, military, writer, georg, henirich, von, berenhorst, would, later, write, in, hindsight, that, ever, since, the, reign, of, the, soldier, king, prussia, always, remained, not, a, country, with, an, army, but, an, army, with, a, country, a, quote, often, misattributed, to, voltaire, and, honor, gabriel, riqueti, comte, de, mirabeau, after, napoleon, bonaparte, defeated, prussia, in, 1806, one, of, the, conditions, of, peace, was, that, prussia, should, reduce, its, army, to, no, more, than, 42, 000, men, in, order, that, the, country, should, not, again, be, so, defeated, the, king, of, prussia, enrolled, the, permitted, number, of, men, for, one, year, trained, and, then, dismissed, that, group, and, enrolled, another, of, the, same, size, and, so, on, thus, in, the, course, of, ten, years, he, was, able, to, gather, an, army, of, 420, 000, men, who, had, at, least, one, year, of, military, training, the, officers, of, the, army, were, drawn, almost, entirely, from, among, the, land, owning, nobility, the, result, was, that, there, was, gradually, built, up, a, large, class, of, professional, officers, on, the, one, hand, and, a, much, larger, class, the, rank, and, file, of, the, army, on, the, other, these, enlisted, men, had, become, conditioned, to, obey, implicitly, all, the, commands, of, the, officers, creating, a, class, based, culture, of, deference, this, system, led, to, several, consequences, since, the, officer, class, also, furnished, most, of, the, officials, for, the, civil, administration, of, the, country, the, interests, of, the, army, came, to, be, considered, as, identical, to, the, interests, of, the, country, as, a, whole, a, second, result, was, that, the, governing, class, desired, to, continue, a, system, which, gave, them, so, much, power, over, the, common, people, contributing, to, the, continuing, influence, of, the, junker, noble, classes, militarism, in, germany, continued, after, world, war, i, and, the, fall, of, the, german, monarchy, in, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, in, spite, of, allied, attempts, to, crush, german, militarism, by, means, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, as, the, allies, saw, prussian, and, german, militarism, as, one, of, the, major, causes, of, the, great, war, during, the, period, of, the, weimar, republic, 1918, 1933, the, 1920, kapp, putsch, an, attempted, coup, d, tat, against, the, republican, government, was, launched, by, disaffected, members, of, the, armed, forces, after, this, event, some, of, the, more, radical, militarists, and, nationalists, were, submerged, in, grief, and, despair, into, the, nsdap, party, of, adolf, hitler, while, more, moderate, elements, of, militarism, declined, and, remained, affiliated, with, the, german, national, people, s, party, dnvp, instead, throughout, its, entire, 14, year, existence, the, weimar, republic, remained, under, threat, of, militaristic, nationalism, as, many, germans, felt, the, treaty, of, versailles, humiliated, their, militaristic, culture, the, weimar, years, saw, large, scale, right, wing, militarist, and, paramilitary, mass, organizations, such, as, der, stahlhelm, as, well, as, militias, such, as, the, freikorps, which, was, banned, in, 1921, in, the, same, year, the, reichswehr, set, up, the, black, reichswehr, a, secret, reserve, of, trained, soldiers, networked, within, its, units, organised, as, labour, battalions, arbeitskommandos, to, circumvent, the, treaty, of, versailles, 100, 000, man, limit, on, the, german, army, it, was, dissolved, in, 1923, many, members, of, the, freikorps, and, the, black, reichswehr, went, on, to, join, the, sturmabteilung, sa, the, paramilitary, branch, of, the, nazi, party, all, of, these, were, responsible, for, the, political, violence, of, so, called, feme, murders, and, an, overall, atmosphere, of, lingering, civil, war, during, the, weimar, period, during, the, weimar, era, mathematician, and, political, writer, emil, julius, gumbel, published, in, depth, analyses, of, the, militarist, paramilitary, violence, characterizing, german, public, life, as, well, as, the, state, s, lenient, to, sympathetic, reaction, to, it, if, the, violence, was, committed, by, the, political, right, nazi, germany, was, a, strongly, militarist, state, after, its, defeat, in, 1945, militarism, in, german, culture, was, dramatically, reduced, as, a, backlash, against, the, nazi, period, and, the, allied, control, council, and, later, the, allied, high, commission, oversaw, a, program, of, attempted, fundamental, re, education, of, the, german, people, at, large, in, order, to, put, a, stop, to, german, militarism, once, and, for, all, the, federal, republic, of, germany, today, maintains, a, large, modern, military, and, has, one, of, the, highest, defence, budgets, in, the, world, at, 1, 3, percent, of, germany, s, gdp, it, is, in, 2019, similar, in, cash, terms, to, those, of, the, united, kingdom, france, and, japan, at, around, us, 50bn, the, rise, of, militarism, in, india, dates, back, to, the, british, raj, with, the, establishment, of, several, indian, independence, movement, organizations, such, as, the, indian, national, army, led, by, subhas, chandra, bose, the, indian, national, army, ina, played, a, crucial, role, in, pressuring, the, british, raj, after, it, occupied, the, andaman, and, nicobar, islands, with, the, help, of, imperial, japan, but, the, movement, lost, momentum, due, to, lack, of, support, by, the, indian, national, congress, the, battle, of, imphal, and, bose, s, sudden, death, after, india, gained, independence, in, 1947, tensions, with, neighbouring, pakistan, over, the, kashmir, dispute, and, other, issues, led, the, indian, government, to, emphasize, military, preparedness, see, also, the, political, integration, of, india, after, the, sino, indian, war, in, 1962, india, dramatically, expanded, its, military, which, helped, india, win, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1971, india, became, the, third, asian, country, in, the, world, to, possess, nuclear, weapons, culminating, in, the, tests, of, 1998, the, kashmiri, insurgency, and, recent, events, including, the, kargil, war, against, pakistan, assured, that, the, indian, government, remained, committed, to, military, expansion, the, disputed, jammu, and, kashmir, region, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, world, s, most, militarized, places, in, recent, years, the, indian, government, has, increased, the, military, expenditure, of, the, 1, 4, million, strong, military, across, all, branches, and, embarked, on, a, rapid, modernization, program, in, parallel, with, 20th, century, german, militarism, japanese, militarism, began, with, a, series, of, events, by, which, the, military, gained, prominence, in, dictating, japan, s, affairs, this, was, evident, in, 15th, century, japan, s, sengoku, period, or, age, of, warring, states, where, powerful, samurai, warlords, daimy, s, played, a, significant, role, in, japanese, politics, japan, s, militarism, is, deeply, rooted, in, the, ancient, samurai, tradition, centuries, before, japan, s, modernization, even, though, a, militarist, philosophy, was, intrinsic, to, the, shogunates, a, nationalist, style, of, militarism, developed, after, the, meiji, restoration, which, restored, the, emperor, to, power, and, began, the, empire, of, japan, it, is, exemplified, by, the, 1882, imperial, rescript, to, soldiers, and, sailors, which, called, for, all, members, of, the, armed, forces, to, have, an, absolute, personal, loyalty, to, the, emperor, in, the, 20th, century, approximately, in, the, 1920s, two, factors, contributed, both, to, the, power, of, the, military, and, chaos, within, its, ranks, one, was, the, military, ministers, to, be, active, duty, officers, law, which, required, the, imperial, japanese, army, ija, and, imperial, japanese, navy, ijn, to, agree, to, the, ministry, of, army, position, in, the, cabinet, this, essentially, gave, the, military, veto, power, over, the, formation, of, any, cabinet, in, the, ostensibly, parliamentary, country, another, factor, was, gekokuj, or, institutionalized, disobedience, by, junior, officers, it, was, not, uncommon, for, radical, junior, officers, to, press, their, goals, to, the, extent, of, assassinating, their, seniors, in, 1936, this, phenomenon, resulted, in, the, february, 26, incident, in, which, junior, officers, attempted, a, coup, d, tat, and, killed, leading, members, of, the, japanese, government, the, rebellion, enraged, emperor, hirohito, and, he, ordered, its, suppression, which, was, successfully, carried, out, by, loyal, members, of, the, military, in, the, 1930s, the, great, depression, damaged, japan, s, economy, and, gave, radical, elements, within, the, japanese, military, the, chance, to, realize, their, ambitions, of, conquering, all, of, asia, in, 1931, the, kwantung, army, a, japanese, military, force, stationed, in, manchuria, staged, the, mukden, incident, which, sparked, the, invasion, of, manchuria, and, its, transformation, into, the, japanese, puppet, state, of, manchukuo, six, years, later, the, marco, polo, bridge, incident, outside, peking, sparked, the, second, sino, japanese, war, 1937, 1945, japanese, troops, streamed, into, china, conquering, peking, shanghai, and, the, national, capital, of, nanking, the, last, conquest, was, followed, by, the, nanking, massacre, in, 1940, japan, entered, into, an, alliance, with, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, two, similarly, militaristic, states, in, europe, and, advanced, out, of, china, and, into, southeast, asia, the, following, year, japan, attacked, pearl, harbor, to, prevent, the, intervention, of, the, united, states, which, had, banned, oil, sales, to, japan, in, response, to, the, second, sino, japanese, war, and, the, ensuing, invasion, of, indochina, in, 1945, japan, surrendered, to, the, united, states, beginning, the, occupation, of, japan, and, the, purging, of, all, militarist, influences, from, japanese, society, and, politics, in, 1947, the, new, constitution, of, japan, supplanted, the, meiji, constitution, as, the, fundamental, law, of, the, country, replacing, the, rule, of, the, emperor, with, parliamentary, government, with, this, event, the, empire, of, japan, officially, came, to, an, end, and, the, modern, state, of, japan, was, founded, s, n, gun, often, transliterated, songun, north, korea, s, military, first, policy, regards, military, power, as, the, highest, priority, of, the, country, this, has, escalated, so, much, in, the, dprk, that, one, in, five, people, serves, in, the,

framework, of, the, government, designating, the, military, as, the, supreme, repository, of, power, it, also, facilitates, the, militarization, of, non, military, sectors, by, emphasizing, the, unity, of, the, military, and, the, people, by, spreading, military, culture, among, the, masses, the, north, korean, government, grants, the, korean, people, s, army, as, the, highest, priority, in, the, economy, and, in, resource, allocation, and, positions, it, as, the, model, for, society, to, emulate, songun, is, also, the, ideological, concept, behind, a, shift, in, policies, since, the, death, of, kim, il, sung, in, 1994, which, emphasize, the, people, s, military, over, all, other, aspects, of, state, and, the, interests, of, the, military, comes, first, before, the, masses,

education, russia, has, also, had, a, long, history, of, militarism, continuing, on, to, the, present, day, driven, by, its, desire, to, protect, its, western, frontier, which, has, no, natural, buffers, between, potential, invaders, from, the, rest, of, continental, europe, and, her, heartlands, in, european, russia, ever, since, peter, the, great, s, reforms, russia, became, one, of,

into, eastern, europe, eventually, conquering, the, majority, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, the, end, of, imperial, rule, in, 1917, meant, the, loss, of, some, territory, following, the,

in, a, military, alliance, known, as, the, warsaw, pact, with, the, soviet, army, playing, a, key, role, all, this, was, lost, with, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, russia, was, greatly, weakened, in, what, russia, s, second, president, vladimir, putin, called, the, greatest, geopolitical, disaster, of, the, 20th, century, nevertheless, under, putin, s, leadership, a,

life, militarism, was, only, introduced, into, daily, life, with, the, advent, of, modern, institutions, particularly, schools, which, became, part, of, the, state, apparatus, when, the, ottoman, empire, was, succeeded, by, a, new, nation, state, the, republic, of, turkey, in, 1923, the, founders, of, the, republic, were, determined, to, break, with, the, past, and, modernise, the, country, there, was, however, an, inherent, contradiction, in, that, their, modernist, vision, was, limited, by, their, military, roots, the, leading, reformers, were, all, military, men, and, in, keeping, with, the, military, tradition, all, believed, in, the, authority, and, the, sacredness, of, the, state, the, public, also, believed, in, the, military, it, was, the, military, after, all, who, led,

the, hanging, of, pm, adnan, menderes, and, 2, ministers, and, a, new, constitution, was, introduced, creating, a, constitutional, court, to, vet, the, legislation, passed, by, parliament, and, a, military, dominated, national, security, council, to, oversee, the, government, affairs, similar, to, the, politburo, in, the, soviet, union, the, second, military, coup, took, place, on, 12, march,

was, another, military, intervention, that, was, called, a, post, modern, coup, on, 28, february, 1997, which, merely, forced, the, government, to, resign, and, finally, an, unsuccessful, military, coup, attempt, on, 15, july, 2016, the, constitutional, referendums, in, 2010, and, 2017, have, changed, the, composition, and, role, of, the, national, security, council, and, placed, the, armed,

caribbean, and, economic, militarism, to, support, the, development, of, the, new, industrial, economy, this, reform, was, the, result, of, a, conflict, between, neo, hamiltonian, republicans, and, jeffersonian, jacksonian, democrats, over, the, proper, administration, of, the, state, and, direction, of, its, foreign, policy, the, conflict, pitted, proponents, of, professionalism, based, on, business, management, principles, against, those, favoring, more, local, control, in, the, hands, of, laymen, and, political, appointees, the, outcome, of, this, struggle, including, a, more, professional, federal, civil, service, and, a, strengthened, presidency, and, executive, branch, made, a, more, expansionist, foreign, policy, possible, after, the, end, of, the, american, civil, war,

control, from, the, central, government, prepared, for, future, conflicts, and, develop, refined, command, and, support, structures, these, reforms, led, to, the, development, of, professional, military, thinkers, and, cadre, during, this, time, the, ideas, of, social, darwinism, helped, propel, american, overseas, expansion, in, the, pacific, and, caribbean, this, required, modifications, for, a, more, efficient, central, government, due, to, the, added, administration, requirements, see, above, the, enlargement, of, the, u, s, army, for, the, spanish, american, war, was, considered,
