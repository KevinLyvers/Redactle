of, the, afro, asiatic, language, family, and, originated, in, the, nile, delta, in, lower, egypt, the, estimated, 100, million, egyptians, speak, a, continuum, of, dialects, among, which, cairene, is, the, most, prominent, it, is, also, understood, across, most, of, the, arabic, speaking, countries, due, to, broad, egyptian, influence, in, the, region, including, through, egyptian, cinema, and, egyptian, music, these, factors, help, to, make, it, the, most, widely, spoken, and, by, far, the, most, widely, studied, variety, of, arabic, while, it, is, primarily, a, spoken, language, the, written, form, is, used, in, novels, plays, and, poems, vernacular, literature, as, well, as, in, comics, advertising, some, newspapers, and, transcriptions, of, popular, songs, in, most, other,

egyptian, arabic, generally, call, their, vernacular, arabic, when, juxtaposed, with, non, arabic, languages, colloquial, egyptian, or, simply, aamiyya, colloquial, when, juxtaposed, with, modern, standard, arabic, and, the, egyptian, dialect, or, simply, masri, egyptian, when, juxtaposed, with, other, vernacular, arabic, dialects, the, term, egyptian, arabic, is, usually, used, synonymously, with, cairene, arabic, which, is, technically, a, dialect, of, egyptian, arabic, the, country, s, native, name, ma, r, is, often, used, locally, to, refer, to, cairo, itself, as, is, the, case, with, parisian, french, cairene, arabic, is, by, far, the, most, prevalent, dialect, in, the, country, egyptian, arabic, has, become, widely, understood, in, the, arabic, speaking, world, primarily, for, two, reasons, the, proliferation, and, popularity, of, egyptian, films, and, other, media, in, the, region, since, the, early, 20th, century, as, well, as, the, great, number, of, egyptian, teachers, and, professors, who, were, instrumental, in, setting, up, the, education, systems, of, various, countries, in, the, arabian, peninsula, and, also, taught, there, and, in, other, countries, such, as, algeria, and, libya, also, many, lebanese, artists, choose, to, sing, in, egyptian, arabic, was, spoken, in, parts, of, egypt, such, as, the, eastern, desert, and, sinai, before, islam, however, nile, valley, egyptians, slowly, adopted, arabic, as, a, written, language, following, the, muslim, conquest, of, egypt, in, the, seventh, century, until, then, they, had, spoken, either, koine, greek, or, egyptian, in, its, coptic, form, a, period, of, coptic, arabic, bilingualism, in, lower, egypt, lasted, for, more, than, three, centuries, the, period, would, last, much, longer, in, the, south, arabic, had, been, already, familiar, to, valley, egyptians, since, arabic, had, been, spoken, throughout, the, eastern, desert, and, sinai, arabic, was, also, a, minority, language, of, some, residents, of, the, nile, valley, such, as, qift, in, upper, egypt, through, pre, islamic, trade, with, nabateans, in, the, sinai, peninsula, and, the, easternmost, part, of, the, nile, delta, egyptian, arabic, seems, to, have, begun, taking, shape, in, fustat, the, first, islamic, capital, of, egypt, now, part, of, cairo, one, of, the, earliest, linguistic, sketches, of, cairene, arabic, is, a, 16th, century, document, entitled, daf, al, i, r, an, kal, m, ahl, mi, r, the, removal, of, the, burden, from, the, language, of, the, people, of, cairo, by, the, traveler, and, lexicographer, yusuf, al, maghribi, with, misr, here, meaning, cairo, it, contains, key, information, on, early, cairene, arabic, and, the, language, situation, in, egypt, in, the, middle, ages, the, main, purpose, of, the, document, was, to, show, that, while, the, cairenes, vernacular, contained, many, critical, errors, vis, vis, classical, arabic, according, to, al, maghribi, it, was, also, related, to, arabic, in, other, respects, with, few, waves, of, immigration, from, the, arabian, peninsula, such, as, the, banu, hilal, exodus, who, later, left, egypt, and, were, settled, in, morocco, and, tunisia, together, with, the, ongoing, islamization, and, arabization, of, the, country, multiple, arabic, varieties, one, of, which, is, egyptian, arabic, slowly, supplanted, spoken, coptic, local, chroniclers, mention, the, continued, use, of, coptic, as, a, spoken, language, until, the, 17th, century, by, peasant, women, in, upper, egypt, coptic, is, still, the, liturgical, language, of, the, coptic, orthodox, church, of, alexandria, and, the, coptic, catholic, church, egyptian, arabic, has, no, official, status, and, is, not, officially, recognized, as, a, language, standard, arabic, is, the, official, language, of, the, state, as, per, constitutional, law, with, the, name, al, lu, a, al, arabiyyah, lit, arabic, language, interest, in, the, local, vernacular, began, in, the, 1800s, in, opposition, to, the, language, of, the, ruling, class, turkish, as, the, egyptian, national, movement, for, self, determination, was, taking, shape, for, many, decades, to, follow, questions, about, the, reform, and, the, modernization, of, arabic, were, hotly, debated, in, egyptian, intellectual, circles, proposals, ranged, from, developing, neologisms, to, replace, archaic, terminology, in, modern, standard, arabic, to, the, simplification, of, syntactical, and, morphological, rules, and, the, introduction, of, colloquialisms, to, even, complete, egyptianization, tam, r, by, abandoning, the, so, called, modern, standard, arabic, in, favor, of, masri, or, egyptian, arabic, proponents, of, language, reform, in, egypt, included, qasim, amin, who, also, wrote, the, first, egyptian, feminist, treatise, former, president, of, the, egyptian, university, ahmed, lutfi, el, sayed, and, noted, intellectual, salama, moussa, they, adopted, a, modernist, secular, approach, and, disagreed, with, the, assumption, that, arabic, was, an, immutable, language, because, of, its, association, with, the, qur, an, the, first, modern, egyptian, novel, in, which, the, dialogue, was, written, in, the, vernacular, was, muhammad, husayn, haykal, s, zaynab, in, 1913, it, was, only, in, 1966, that, mustafa, musharafa, s, kantara, who, disbelieved, was, released, the, first, novel, to, be, written, entirely, in, egyptian, arabic, other, notable, novelists, such, as, ihsan, abdel, quddous, and, yusuf, idris, and, poets, such, as, salah, jahin, abdel, rahman, el, abnudi, and, ahmed, fouad, negm, helped, solidify, vernacular, literature, as, a, distinct, literary, genre, amongst, certain, groups, within, egypt, s, elite, egyptian, arabic, enjoyed, a, brief, period, of, rich, literary, output, that, dwindled, with, the, rise, of, pan, arabism, which, had, gained, popularity, in, egypt, by, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, as, demonstrated, by, egypt, s, involvement, in, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, under, king, farouk, of, egypt, the, egyptian, revolution, of, 1952, led, by, mohammed, naguib, and, gamal, abdel, nasser, further, enhanced, the, significance, of, pan, arabism, making, it, a, central, element, of, egyptian, state, policy, the, importance, of, modern, standard, arabic, was, reemphasised, in, the, public, sphere, by, the, revolutionary, government, and, efforts, to, accord, any, formal, language, status, to, the, egyptian, vernacular, were, ignored, egyptian, arabic, was, identified, as, a, mere, dialect, one, that, was, not, spoken, even, in, all, of, egypt, as, almost, all, of, upper, egypt, speaks, sa, idi, arabic, though, the, revolutionary, government, heavily, sponsored, the, use, of, the, egyptian, vernacular, in, films, plays, television, programmes, and, music, the, prerevolutionary, use, of, modern, standard, arabic, in, official, publications, was, retained, linguistic, commentators, have, noted, the, multi, faceted, approach, of, the, egyptian, revolutionaries, towards, the, arabic, language, whereas, egypt, s, first, president, mohammed, naguib, exhibited, a, preference, for, using, modern, standard, arabic, in, his, public, speeches, his, successor, gamal, abdel, nasser, was, renowned, for, using, the, vernacular, and, for, punctuating, his, speeches, with, traditional, egyptian, words, and, expressions, conversely, modern, standard, arabic, was, the, norm, for, state, news, outlets, including, newspapers, magazines, television, and, radio, that, was, especially, true, of, egypt, s, national, broadcasting, company, the, arab, radio, and, television, union, which, was, established, with, the, intent, of, providing, content, for, the, entire, arab, world, not, merely, egypt, hence, the, need, to, broadcast, in, the, standard, rather, than, the, vernacular, language, the, voice, of, the, arabs, radio, station, in, particular, had, an, audience, from, across, the, region, and, the, use, of, anything, other, than, modern, standard, arabic, was, viewed, as, eminently, incongruous, in, a, study, of, three, egyptian, newspapers, al, ahram, al, masry, al, youm, and, al, dustour, zeinab, ibrahim, concluded, that, the, total, number, of, headlines, in, egyptian, arabic, in, each, newspaper, varied, al, ahram, did, not, include, any, al, masry, al, youm, had, an, average, of, 5, of, headlines, in, egyptian, while, al, dustour, averaged, 11, as, the, status, of, egyptian, arabic, as, opposed, to, classical, arabic, can, have, such, political, and, religious, implications, in, egypt, the, question, of, whether, egyptian, arabic, should, be, considered, a, dialect, or, language, can, be, a, source, of, debate, in, sociolinguistics, egyptian, arabic, can, be, seen, as, one, of, many, distinct, varieties, that, despite, arguably, being, languages, on, abstand, grounds, are, united, by, a, common, dachsprache, in, modern, standard, arabic,

throughout, egypt, however, are, more, wide, ranging, and, do, not, neatly, correspond, to, the, simple, division, the, language, shifts, from, the, eastern, to, the, western, parts, of, the, nile,

noted, for, certain, shibboleths, separating, its, speech, from, that, of, cairo, south, delta, the, ones, that, are, most, frequently, noted, in, popular, discourse, are, the, use, of, the, word, falafel, as, opposed, to, ta, miyya, for, the, fava, bean, fritters, common, across, the, country, and, the, pronunciation, of, the, word, for, the, egyptian, pound, gin, h, as, closer, to, the, pronunciation, of, the, origin, of, the, term, the, british, guinea, the, speech, of, the, older, alexandrians, is, also, noted, for, use, of, the, same, pre, syllable, ne, in, the, singular, and,

all, rural, dialects, a, lot, of, them, do, not, have, such, replacement, the, dialect, also, has, many, grammatical, differences, when, contrasted, to, urban, dialects, egyptian, arabic, has, a, phonology, that, differs, significantly, from, that, of, other, varieties, of, arabic, and, has, its, own, inventory, of, consonants, and, vowels, in, contrast, to, ca, and, msa, but, like, all, modern, colloquial, varieties, of, arabic, egyptian, arabic, nouns, are, not, inflected, for, case, and, lack, nunation, with, the, exception, of, certain, fixed, phrases, in, the, accusative, case, such, as, thank, you, as, all, nouns, take, their, pausal, forms, singular, words, and, broken, plurals, simply, lose, their, case, endings, in, sound, plurals, and, dual, forms, where, in, msa, difference, in, case, is, present, even, in, pausal, forms, the, genitive, accusative, form, is, the, one, preserved, fixed, expressions, in, the, construct, state, beginning, in, abu, often,

the, declension, for, the, broken, plural, however, a, different, pattern, for, the, stem, is, used, the, sound, plural, with, the, suffix, n, is, used, for, nouns, referring, to, male, persons, that,

verbal, nouns, of, form, i, are, not, regular, the, following, table, lists, common, patterns, egyptian, arabic, object, pronouns, are, clitics, in, that, they, attach, to, the, end, of, a, noun, verb, or, preposition, with, the, result, forming, a, single, phonological, word, rather, than, separate, words, clitics, can, be, attached, to, the, following, types, of, words, with, verbs,

four, consonants, the, set, of, consonants, communicates, the, basic, meaning, of, a, verb, changes, to, the, vowels, in, between, the, consonants, along, with, prefixes, and, or, suffixes, specify, grammatical, functions, such, as, tense, person, and, number, in, addition, to, changes, in, the, meaning, of, the, verb, that, embody, grammatical, concepts, such, as, causative, intensive, passive, or, reflexive, each, particular, lexical, verb, is, specified, by, two, stems, one, used, for, the, past, tense, and, one, used, for, non, past, tenses, along, with, subjunctive, and, imperative, moods, to, the, former, stem, suffixes, are, added, to, mark, the, verb, for, person, number, and, gender, while, to, the, latter, stem, a, combination, of, prefixes, and, suffixes, are, added, very, approximately, the, prefixes, specify, the, person, and, the, suffixes, indicate, number, and, gender, since, arabic, lacks, an, infinitive, the, third, person, masculine, singular, past, tense, form, serves, as, the, dictionary, form, used, to, identify, a, verb, for, example, the, verb, meaning, write, is, often, specified, as, k, tab, which, actually, means, he, wrote, in, the, paradigms, below, a, verb, will, be, specified, as, k, tab, y, ktib, where, k, tab, means, he, wrote, and, y, ktib, means, he, writes, indicating, the, past, stem, katab, and, non, past, stem, ktib, obtained, by, removing, the, prefix, yi, the, verb, classes, in, arabic, are, formed, along, two, axes, one, axis, described, as, form, i, form, ii, etc, is, used, to, specify, grammatical, concepts, such, as, causative, intensive, passive, or, reflexive, and, involves, varying, the, stem, form, for, example, from, the, root, k, t, b, write, is, derived, form, i, k, tab, y, ktib, write, form, ii, k, ttib, yik, ttib, cause, to, write, form, iii, k, tib, yik, tib, correspond, etc, the, other, axis, is, determined, by, the, particular, consonants, making, up, the, root, for, example, defective, verbs, have, a, w, or, y, as, the, last, root, consonant, which, is, often, reflected, in, paradigms, with, an, extra, final, vowel, in, the, stem, e, g, r, ma, y, rmi, throw, from, r, m, y, meanwhile, hollow, verbs, have, a, w, or, y, as, the, middle, root, consonant, and, the, stems, of, such, verbs, appear, to, have, only, two, consonants, e, g, g, b, yig, b, bring, from, g, y, b, strong, verbs, are, those, that, have, no, weakness, e, g, w, or, y, in, the, root, consonants, each, verb, has, a, given, vowel, pattern, for, past, a, or, i, and, present, a, or, i, or, u, combinations, of, each, exist, form, i, verbs, have, a, given, vowel, pattern, for, past, a, or, i, and, present, a, i, or, u, combinations, of, each, exist, example, k, tab, y, ktib, write, note, that, in, general, the, present, indicative, is, formed, from, the, subjunctive, by, the, addition, of, bi, bi, a, is, elided, to, ba, similarly, the, future, is, formed, from, the, subjunctive, by, the, addition, of, a, a,

example, f, him, y, fham, understand, boldfaced, forms, f, hm, it, and, f, hm, u, differ, from, the, corresponding, forms, of, katab, k, tab, it, and, k, tab, u, due, to, vowel, syncope, note, also, the, syncope, in, na, fh, m, t, i, understood, example, d, rris, yid, rris, teach, boldfaced, forms, indicate, the, primary, differences, from, the, corresponding, forms, of, katab, example, s, fir, yis, fir, travel, the, primary, differences, from, the, corresponding, forms, of, darris, shown, in, boldface, are, defective, verbs, have, a, w, or, y, as, the, last, root, consonant, example, r, ma, y, rmi, throw, away, i, e, trash, etc, the, primary, differences, from, the, corresponding, forms, of, katab, shown, in, boldface, are, example, n, si, y, nsa, forget, this, verb, type, is, quite, similar, to, the, defective, verb, type, r, ma, y, rmi, the, primary, differences, are, some, other, verbs, have, different, stem, variations, e, g, m, i, y, m, i, walk, with, i, in, both, stems, and, b, a, y, b, a, become, remain, with, a, in, both, stems, the, verb, l, a, yil, i, find, is, unusual, in, having, a, mixture, of, a, form, i, past, and, form, iii, present, note, also, the, variations, l, i, y, l, a, and, l, a, y, l, a, verbs, other, than, form, i, have, consistent, stem, vowels, all, such, verbs, have, a, in, the, past, hence, form, stems, with, not, forms, v, vi, x, and, iiq,

including, defective, verbs, behave, as, regular, doubled, verbs, hollow, have, a, w, or, y, as, the, middle, root, consonant, for, some, forms, e, g, form, ii, and, form, iii, hollow, verbs, are, conjugated, as, strong, verbs, e, g, form, ii, yyin, yi, yyin, appoint, from, y, n, form, iii, g, wib, yig, wib, answer, from, g, w, b, example, g, b, yig, b, bring, this, verb, works, much, like, d, rris, yid, rris, teach, like, all, verbs, whose, stem, begins, with, a, single, consonant, the, prefixes, differ, in, the, following, way, from, those, of, regular, and, defective, form, i, verbs, in, addition, the, past, tense, has, two, stems, g, b, before, consonant, initial, suffixes, first, and, second, person, and, g, b, elsewhere, third, person, example, f, yi, f, see, this, verb, class, is, identical, to, verbs, such, as, g, b, yig, b, except, in, having, stem, vowel, u, in, place, of, i, doubled, verbs, have, the, same, consonant, as, middle, and, last, root, consonant, e, g, bb, yi, bb, love, from, b, b, example, bb, yi, bb, love, this, verb, works, much, like, g, b, yig, b, bring, like, that, class, it, has, two, stems, in, the, past, which, are, abb, before, consonant, initial, suffixes, first, and, second, person, and, bb, elsewhere, third, person, was, borrowed, from, the, defective, verbs, the, classical, arabic, equivalent, form, would, be, ab, b, e, g, ab, b, t, other, verbs, have, u, or, a, in, the, present, stem, ba, yib, to, look, a, yi, be, right, be, proper, as, for, the, other, forms, assimilated, verbs, have, w, or, y, as, the, first, root, consonant, most, of, these, verbs, have, been, regularized, in, egyptian, arabic, e, g, w, zan, y, wzin, to, weigh, or, w, l, y, w, al, to, arrive, only, a, couple, of, irregular, verbs, remain, e, g, w, if, y, af, stop, and, w, i, y, a, fall, see, below, doubly, weak, verbs, have, more, than, one, weakness, typically, a, w, or, y, as, both, the, second, and, third, consonants, this, term, is, in, fact, a, misnomer, as, such, verbs, actually, behave, as, normal, defective, verbs, e, g, k, wa, y, kwi, iron, clothes, from, k, w, y, wwa, yi, wwi, strengthen, from, w, y, d, wa, yid, wi, treat, cure, from, d, w, y, the, irregular, verbs, are, as, follows, example, g, y, gi, come, non, finite, forms, in, this, section, all, verb, classes, and, their, corresponding, stems, are, listed, excluding, the, small, number, of, irregular, verbs, described, above, verb, roots, are, indicated, schematically, using, capital, letters, to, stand, for, consonants, in, the, root, hence, the, root, f, m, l, stands, for, all, three, consonant, roots, and, f, s, t, l, stands, for, all, four, consonant, roots, traditional, arabic, grammar, uses, f, l, and, f, l, l, respectively, but, the, system, used, here, appears, in, a, number, of, grammars, of, spoken, arabic, dialects, and, is, probably, less, confusing, for, english, speakers, since, the, forms, are, easier, to, pronounce, than, those, involving, the, following, table, lists, the, prefixes, and, suffixes, to, be, added, to, mark, tense, person, number, and, gender, and, the, stem, form, to, which, they, are, added, the, forms, involving, a, vowel, initial, suffix, and, corresponding, stem, pa, v, or, np, v, are, highlighted, in, silver, the, forms, involving, a, consonant, initial, suffix, and, corresponding, stem, pa, c, are, highlighted, in, gold, the, forms, involving, a, no, suffix, and, corresponding, stem, pa, 0, or, np, 0, are, unhighlighted, the, following, table, lists, the, verb, classes, along, with, the, form, of, the, past, and, non, past, stems, active, and, passive, participles, and, verbal, noun, in, addition, to, an, example, verb, for, each, class, notes, one, characteristic, feature, of, egyptian, syntax, is, the, two, part, negative, verbal, circumfix, ma, i, which, it, shares, with, other, north, african, dialect, areas, as, well, as, some, southern, levantine, dialect, areas, probably, as, a, result, of, the, influence, of, egyptian, arabic, on, these, areas, ma, probably, comes, from, the, arabic, negator, ma, this, negating, circumfix, is, similar, in, function, to, the, french, circumfix, ne, pas, it, should, also, be, noted, that, coptic, and, ancient, egyptian, both, had, negative, circumfix, the, structure, can, end, in, a, consonant, or, in, a, vowel, i, varying, according, to, the, individual, or, region, nowadays, speakers, use, however, i, was, sometimes, used, stylistically, specially, in, the, past, as, attested, in, old, films, the, negative, circumfix, often, surrounds, the, entire, verbal, composite, including, direct, and, indirect, object, pronouns, however, verbs, in, the, future, tense, can, instead, use, the, prefix, mi, interrogative, sentences, can, be, formed, by, adding, the, negation, clitic, mi, before, the, verb, addition, of, the, circumfix, can, cause, complex, changes, to, the, verbal, cluster, due, to, the, application, of, the, rules, of, vowel, syncope, shortening, lengthening, insertion, and, elision, described, above, in, addition, certain, other, morphological, changes, occur, in, contrast, with, classical, arabic, but, much, like, the, other, varieties, of, arabic, egyptian, arabic, prefers, subject, verb, object, svo, word, order, ca, and, to, a, lesser, extent, msa, prefer, verb, subject, object, vso, for, example, in, msa, adel, read, the, book, would, be, qara, a, dilu, l, kit, b, ipa, whereas, ea, would, say, dil, ara, l, kit, b, ipa, also, in, common, with, other, arabic, varieties, is, the, loss, of, unique, agreement, in, the, dual, form, while, the, dual, remains, productive, to, some, degree, in, nouns, dual, nouns, are, analyzed, as, plural, for, the, purpose, of, agreement, with, verbs, demonstratives, and, adjectives, thus, these, two, syrian, professors, are, walking, to, the, university, in, msa, in, an, svo, sentence, for, ease, of, comparison, would, be, ha, n, al, ust, n, as, s, riyy, n, yam, iy, n, il, l, mi, ah, ipa, which, becomes, in, ea, il, ustaz, n, il, suriyy, n, d, l, biyim, u, lil, gam, a, ipa, unlike, most, other, forms, of, arabic, however, egyptian, prefers, final, placement, of, question, words, in, interrogative, sentences, this, is, a, feature, characteristic, of, the, coptic, substratum, of, egyptian, arabic, some, authors, have, argued, for, the, influence, of, a, substratum, of, the, coptic, language, which, was, the, native, language, of, the, vast, majority, of, nile, valley, egyptians, prior, to, the, muslim, conquest, on, egyptian, arabic, specifically, on, its, phonology, syntax, and, lexicon, coptic, is, the, latest, stage, of, the, indigenous, egyptian, language, spoken, until, the, mid, 17th, century, when, it, was, finally, completely, supplanted, among, egyptian, muslims, and, a, majority, of, copts, by, the, egyptian, arabic, since, coptic, lacked, interdental, consonants, it, could, possibly, have, influenced, the, manifestation, of, their, occurrences, in, classical, arabic, as, their, dental, counterparts, t, d, and, the, emphatic, dental, d, respectively, see, consonants, behnstedt, argues, that, the, phenomenon, of, merging, of, interdentals, with, plosives, has, also, occurred, in, areas, without, a, substratum, lacking, interdentals, e, g, in, mecca, aden, and, bahrain, and, can, be, caused, by, drift, rather, than, the, influence, of, a, substratum, concluding, that, n, the, phonological, level, there, is, no, evidence, for, coptic, substratal, influence, a, syntactic, feature, of, to, egyptian, arabic, arguably, inherited, from, coptic, is, the, remaining, of, wh, words, i, e, who, when, why, in, their, logical, positions, in, a, sentence, rather, than, being, preposed, or, moved, to, the, front, of, the, sentence, as, in, mostly, in, classical, arabic, or, english, examples, the, same, sentences, in, literary, arabic, with, all, the, question, words, wh, words, in, the, beginning, of, the, sentence, would, be, diem, argues, that, in, cairene, arabic, also, the, preposition, of, wh, words, occurs, and, in, classical, arabic, and, other, arabic, dialects, also, their, postposition, and, thus, the, effect, of, a, coptic, substratum, might, be, if, at, all, the, preference, for, one, of, the, two, possibilities, behnstedt, estimates, the, existence, of, ca, 250, to, 300, coptic, loanwords, in, egyptian, arabic, there, is, no, fixed, orthography, for, egyptian, arabic, where, it, is, written, in, arabic, script, the, orthography, varies, between, spellings, closer, to, those, of, standard, arabic, and, spellings, closer, to, the, phonology, of, egyptian, arabic, this, variability, arises, from, the, deficiency, of, the, arabic, script, for, writing, the, colloquial, egyptian, arabic, for, which, it, is, not, designed, part, of, this, is, the, unavailability, of, signs, for, some, sounds, of, egyptian, arabic, that, are, not, part, of, standard, arabic, both, options, are, used, in, parallel, often, even, in, by, one, author, or, in, one, work, the, two, options, appears, for, example, for, these, cases, in, the, table, below, romanizations, by, different, authors, starting, with, spitta, s, from, 1880, are, given, as, examples, of, the, variety, of, those, used, where, authors, use, custom, glyphs, the, ones, given, try, the, best, available, approximation, the, use, of, transcribing, glyphs, among, different, authors, and, between, those, and, a, representation, of, egyptian, arabic, in, arabic, script, in, doubt, hinds, badawi, 1986, is, used, below, can, not, be, exactly, aligned, because, different, authors, use, different, analyses, of, the, studied, language, here, also, the, table, below, tries, to, give, a, good, approximation, egyptian, arabic, is, used, in, most, social, situations, with, modern, standard, and, classical, arabic, generally, being, used, only, in, writing, and, in, highly, religious, and, or, formal, situations, however, within, egyptian, arabic, there, is, a, wide, range, of, variation, el, said, badawi, identifies, three, distinct, levels, of, egyptian, arabic, based, chiefly,
