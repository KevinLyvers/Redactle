a, tradition, is, a, system, of, beliefs, or, behaviors, folk, custom, passed, down, within, a, group, of, people, or, society, with, symbolic, meaning, or, special, significance, with, origins, in, the, past, a, component, of, cultural, expressions, and, folklore, common, examples, include, holidays, or, impractical, but, socially, meaningful, clothes, like, lawyers, wigs, or, military, officers, spurs, but, the, idea, has, also, been, applied, to, social, norms, and, behaviors, such, as, greetings, etc, traditions, can, persist, and, evolve, for, thousands, of, years, the, word, tradition, itself, derives, from, the, latin, word, tradere, literally, meaning, to, transmit, to, hand, over, to, give, for, safekeeping, while, it, is, reportedly, assumed, that, traditions, have, an, ancient, history, many, traditions, have, been, invented, on, purpose, whether, it, be, political, or, cultural, over, short, periods, of, time, various, academic, disciplines, also, use, the, word, in, a, variety, of, ways, the, impeding, phrase, according, to, tradition, or, by, tradition, usually, means, that, whatever, information, follows, is, known, only, by, oral, tradition, but, is, not, supported, and, perhaps, may, be, refuted, by, physical, documentation, by, a, physical, artifact, or, other, quality, evidence, tradition, indicates, the, quality, of, a, piece, of, information, being, discussed, for, example, according, to, tradition, homer, was, born, on, chios, but, many, other, locales, have, historically, claimed, him, as, theirs, this, tradition, may, never, be, proven, or, disproved, in, another, example, king, arthur, according, to, history, a, true, british, king, has, inspired, many, well, loved, stories, whether, they, are, documented, fact, or, not, does, not, decrease, their, value, as, cultural, history, and, literature, traditions, are, subject, of, study, in, several, academic, fields, of, learning, especially, in, the, humanities, and, social, sciences, such, as, anthropology, archaeology, history, and, sociology, the, conceptualization, of, tradition, as, the, notion, of, holding, on, to, a, previous, time, is, also, found, in, political, and, philosophical, discourse, for, example, it, is, the, basis, of, the, political, concept, of, traditionalism, and, also, strands, of, many, world, religions, including, traditional, catholicism, in, artistic, contexts, tradition, is, used, to, decide, the, correct, display, of, an, art, form, for, example, in, the, performance, of, traditional, genres, such, as, traditional, dance, adherence, to, guidelines, dictating, how, an, art, form, should, be, composed, are, given, greater, importance, than, the, performer, s, own, preferences, a, host, of, factors, can, exacerbate, the, loss, of, tradition, including, industrialization, globalization, and, the, assimilation, or, marginalization, of, specific, cultural, groups, in, response, to, this, tradition, preservation, attempts, and, initiatives, have, now, been, started, in, many, countries, around, the, world, focusing, on, aspects, such, as, traditional, languages, tradition, is, usually, contrasted, with, the, goal, of, modernity, and, should, be, differentiated, from, customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules, and, similar, concepts, the, english, word, tradition, comes, from, the, latin, traditio, via, french, the, noun, from, the, verb, tradere, to, transmit, to, hand, over, to, give, for, safekeeping, it, was, originally, used, in, roman, law, to, refer, to, the, concept, of, legal, transfers, and, inheritance, according, to, anthony, giddens, and, others, the, modern, meaning, of, tradition, evolved, during, the, enlightenment, period, in, opposition, to, modernity, and, progress, as, with, many, other, generic, terms, there, are, many, definitions, of, tradition, the, concept, includes, a, number, of, interrelated, ideas, the, unifying, one, is, that, tradition, refers, to, beliefs, objects, or, customs, performed, or, believed, in, the, past, originating, in, it, transmitted, through, time, by, being, taught, by, one, generation, to, the, other, and, are, performed, or, believed, in, the, present, tradition, can, also, refer, to, beliefs, or, customs, that, are, prehistoric, with, lost, or, arcane, origins, existing, from, time, immemorial, originally, traditions, were, passed, orally, without, the, need, for, a, writing, system, tools, to, aid, this, process, include, poetic, devices, such, as, rhyme, epic, stories, and, alliteration, the, stories, thus, preserved, are, also, referred, to, as, tradition, or, as, part, of, an, oral, tradition, even, such, traditions, however, are, presumed, to, have, originated, been, invented, by, humans, at, some, point, traditions, are, often, presumed, to, be, ancient, unalterable, and, deeply, important, though, they, may, sometimes, be, much, less, natural, than, is, presumed, it, is, presumed, that, at, least, two, transmissions, over, three, generations, are, required, for, a, practice, belief, or, object, to, be, seen, as, traditional, some, traditions, were, deliberately, introduced, for, one, reason, or, another, often, to, highlight, or, enhance, the, importance, of, a, certain, institution, or, truth, traditions, may, also, be, adapted, to, suit, the, needs, of, the, day, and, the, changes, can, become, accepted, as, a, part, of, the, ancient, tradition, tradition, changes, slowly, with, changes, from, one, generation, to, the, other, being, seen, as, significant, thus, those, carrying, out, the, traditions, will, not, be, consciously, aware, of, the, change, and, even, if, a, tradition, undergoes, major, changes, over, many, generations, it, will, be, seen, as, unchanged, there, are, various, origins, and, fields, of, tradition, they, can, refer, to, many, objects, beliefs, and, customs, can, be, traditional, rituals, of, social, interaction, can, be, traditional, with, phrases, and, gestures, such, as, saying, thank, you, sending, birth, announcements, greeting, cards, etc, tradition, can, also, refer, to, larger, concepts, practiced, by, groups, family, traditions, at, christmas, organizations, company, s, picnic, or, societies, such, as, the, practice, of, national, and, public, holidays, some, of, the, oldest, traditions, include, monotheism, three, millennia, and, citizenship, two, millennia, it, can, also, include, material, objects, such, as, buildings, works, of, art, or, tools, tradition, is, often, used, as, an, adjective, in, contexts, such, as, traditional, music, traditional, medicine, traditional, values, and, others, in, such, constructions, tradition, refers, to, specific, values, and, materials, particular, to, the, discussed, context, passed, through, generations, the, term, invention, of, tradition, introduced, by, e, j, hobsbawm, refers, to, situations, when, a, new, practice, or, object, is, introduced, in, a, manner, that, implies, a, connection, with, the, past, that, is, not, necessarily, present, a, tradition, may, be, deliberately, created, and, promulgated, for, personal, commercial, political, or, national, self, interest, as, was, done, in, colonial, africa, or, it, may, be, adopted, rapidly, based, on, a, single, highly, publicized, event, rather, than, developing, and, spreading, organically, in, a, population, as, in, the, case, of, the, white, wedding, dress, which, only, became, popular, after, queen, victoria, wore, a, white, gown, at, her, wedding, to, albert, of, saxe, coburg, an, example, of, an, invention, of, tradition, is, the, rebuilding, of, the, palace, of, westminster, location, of, the, british, parliament, in, the, gothic, style, similarly, most, of, the, traditions, associated, with, monarchy, of, the, united, kingdom, seen, as, rooted, deep, in, history, actually, date, to, 19th, century, other, examples, include, the, invention, of, tradition, in, africa, and, other, colonial, holdings, by, the, occupying, forces, requiring, legitimacy, the, colonial, power, would, often, invent, a, tradition, which, they, could, use, to, legitimize, their, own, position, for, example, a, certain, succession, to, a, chiefdom, might, be, recognized, by, a, colonial, power, as, traditional, in, order, to, favour, their, own, candidates, for, the, job, often, these, inventions, were, based, in, some, form, of, tradition, but, were, exaggerated, distorted, or, biased, toward, a, particular, interpretation, invented, traditions, are, central, components, of, modern, national, cultures, providing, a, commonality, of, experience, and, promoting, the, unified, national, identity, espoused, by, nationalism, common, examples, include, public, holidays, particularly, those, unique, to, a, particular, nation, the, singing, of, national, anthems, and, traditional, national, cuisine, see, national, dish, expatriate, and, immigrant, communities, may, continue, to, practice, the, national, traditions, of, their, home, nation, in, science, tradition, is, often, used, in, the, literature, in, order, to, define, the, relationship, of, an, author, s, thoughts, to, that, of, his, or, her, field, in, 1948, philosopher, of, science, karl, popper, suggested, that, there, should, be, a, rational, theory, of, tradition, applied, to, science, which, was, fundamentally, sociological, for, popper, each, scientist, who, embarks, on, a, certain, research, trend, inherits, the, tradition, of, the, scientists, before, them, as, he, or, she, inherits, their, studies, and, any, conclusions, that, superseded, it, unlike, myth, which, is, a, means, of, explaining, the, natural, world, through, means, other, than, logical, criticism, scientific, tradition, was, inherited, from, socrates, who, proposed, critical, discussion, according, to, popper, for, thomas, kuhn, who, presented, his, thoughts, in, a, paper, presented, in, 1977, a, sense, of, such, a, critical, inheritance, of, tradition, is, historically, what, sets, apart, the, best, scientists, who, change, their, fields, is, an, embracement, of, tradition, traditions, are, a, subject, of, study, in, several, academic, fields, in, social, sciences, chiefly, anthropology, archaeology, and, biology, with, somewhat, different, meanings, in, different, fields, it, is, also, used, in, varying, contexts, in, other, fields, such, as, history, psychology, and, sociology, social, scientists, and, others, have, worked, to, refine, the, commonsense, concept, of, tradition, to, make, it, into, a, useful, concept, for, scholarly, analysis, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, edward, shils, explored, the, concept, in, detail, since, then, a, wide, variety, of, social, scientists, have, criticized, traditional, ideas, about, tradition, meanwhile, tradition, has, come, into, usage, in, biology, as, applied, to, nonhuman, animals, tradition, as, a, concept, variously, defined, in, different, disciplines, should, not, be, confused, with, various, traditions, perspectives, approaches, in, those, disciplines, tradition, is, one, of, the, key, concepts, in, anthropology, it, can, be, said, that, anthropology, is, the, study, of, tradition, in, traditional, societies, there, is, however, no, theory, of, tradition, as, for, most, anthropologists, the, need, to, discuss, what, tradition, is, seems, unnecessary, as, defining, tradition, is, both, unnecessary, everyone, can, be, expected, to, know, what, it, is, and, unimportant, as, small, differences, in, definition, would, be, just, technical, there, are, however, dissenting, views, scholars, such, as, pascal, boyer, argue, that, defining, tradition, and, developing, theories, about, it, are, important, to, the, discipline, in, archaeology, the, term, tradition, is, a, set, of, cultures, or, industries, which, appear, to, develop, on, from, one, another, over, a, period, of, time, the, term, is, especially, common, in, the, study, of, american, archaeology, biologists, when, examining, groups, of, non, humans, have, observed, repeated, behaviors, which, are, taught, within, communities, from, one, generation, to, the, next, tradition, is, defined, in, biology, as, a, behavioral, practice, that, is, relatively, enduring, i, e, is, performed, repeatedly, over, a, period, of, time, that, is, shared, among, two, or, more, members, of, a, group, that, depends, in, part, on, socially, aided, learning, for, its, generation, in, new, practitioners, and, has, been, called, a, precursor, to, culture, in, the, anthropological, sense, behavioral, traditions, have, been, observed, in, groups, of, fish, birds, and, mammals, groups, of, orangutans, and, chimpanzees, in, particular, may, display, large, numbers, of, behavioral, traditions, and, in, chimpanzees, transfer, of, traditional, behavior, from, one, group, to, another, not, just, within, a, group, has, been, observed, such, behavioral, traditions, may, have, evolutionary, significance, allowing, adaptation, at, a, faster, rate, than, genetic, change, in, the, field, of, musicology, and, ethnomusicology, tradition, refers, to, the, belief, systems, repertoire, techniques, style, and, culture, that, is, passed, down, through, subsequent, generations, tradition, in, music, suggests, a, historical, context, with, which, one, can, perceive, distinguishable, patterns, along, with, a, sense, of, history, traditions, have, a, fluidity, that, cause, them, to, evolve, and, adapt, over, time, while, both, musicology, and, ethnomusicology, are, defined, by, being, the, scholarly, study, of, music, they, differ, in, their, methodology, and, subject, of, research, tradition, or, traditions, can, be, presented, as, a, context, in, which, to, study, the, work, of, a, specific, composer, or, as, a, part, of, a, wide, ranging, historical, perspective, the, concept, of, tradition, in, early, sociological, research, around, the, turn, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, referred, to, that, of, the, traditional, society, as, contrasted, by, the, more, modern, industrial, society, this, approach, was, most, notably, portrayed, in, max, weber, s, concepts, of, traditional, authority, and, modern, rational, legal, authority, in, more, modern, works, one, hundred, years, later, sociology, sees, tradition, as, a, social, construct, used, to, contrast, past, with, the, present, and, as, a, form, of, rationality, used, to, justify, certain, course, of, action, traditional, society, is, characterized, by, lack, of, distinction, between, family, and, business, division, of, labor, influenced, primarily, by, age, gender, and, status, high, position, of, custom, in, the, system, of, values, self, sufficiency, preference, to, saving, and, accumulation, of, capital, instead, of, productive, investment, relative, autarky, early, theories, positing, the, simple, unilineal, evolution, of, societies, from, traditional, to, industrial, model, are, now, seen, as, too, simplistic, in, 1981, edward, shils, in, his, book, tradition, put, forward, a, definition, of, tradition, that, became, universally, accepted, according, to, shils, tradition, is, anything, which, is, transmitted, or, handed, down, from, the, past, to, the, present, another, important, sociological, aspect, of, tradition, is, the, one, that, relates, to, rationality, it, is, also, related, to, the, works, of, max, weber, see, theories, of, rationality, and, were, popularized, and, redefined, in, 1992, by, raymond, boudon, in, his, book, action, in, this, context, tradition, refers, to, the, mode, of, thinking, and, action, justified, as, it, has, always, been, that, way, this, line, of, reasoning, forms, the, basis, of, the, logical, flaw, of, the, appeal, to, tradition, or, argumentum, ad, antiquitatem, which, takes, the, form, this, is, right, because, we, ve, always, done, it, this, way, in, most, cases, such, an, appeal, can, be, refuted, on, the, grounds, that, the, tradition, being, advocated, may, no, longer, be, desirable, or, indeed, may, never, have, been, despite, its, previous, popularity, the, idea, of, tradition, is, important, in, philosophy, twentieth, century, philosophy, is, often, divided, between, an, analytic, tradition, dominant, in, anglophone, and, scandinavian, countries, and, a, continental, tradition, dominant, in, german, and, romance, speaking, europe, increasingly, central, to, continental, philosophy, is, the, project, of, deconstructing, what, its, proponents, following, martin, heidegger, call, the, tradition, which, began, with, plato, and, aristotle, in, contrast, some, continental, philosophers, most, notably, hans, georg, gadamer, have, attempted, to, rehabilitate, the, tradition, of, aristotelianism, this, move, has, been, replicated, within, analytic, philosophy, by, alasdair, macintyre, however, macintyre, has, himself, deconstructed, the, idea, of, the, tradition, instead, posing, aristotelianism, as, one, philosophical, tradition, in, rivalry, with, others, the, concepts, of, tradition, and, traditional, values, are, frequently, used, in, political, and, religious, discourse, to, establish, the, legitimacy, of, a, particular, set, of, values, in, the, united, states, in, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, the, concept, of, tradition, has, been, used, to, argue, for, the, centrality, and, legitimacy, of, conservative, religious, values, similarly, strands, of, orthodox, theological, thought, from, a, number, of, world, religions, openly, identify, themselves, as, wanting, a, return, to, tradition, for, example, the, term, traditionalist, catholic, refers, to, those, such, as, archbishop, lefebvre, who, want, the, worship, and, practices, of, the, church, to, be, as, they, were, before, the, second, vatican, council, of, 1962, 65, likewise, sunni, muslims, are, referred, to, as, ahl, el, sunnah, wa, al, jam, ah, arabic, literally, people, of, the, tradition, and, the, community, emphasizing, their, attachment, to, religious, and, cultural, tradition, more, generally, tradition, has, been, used, as, a, way, of, determining, the, political, spectrum, with, right, wing, parties, having, a, stronger, affinity, to, certain, ways, of, the, past, than, left, wing, ones, here, the, concept, of, adherence, tradition, is, embodied, by, the, political, philosophy, of, traditionalist, conservatism, or, simply, traditionalism, which, emphasizes, the, need, for, the, principles, of, natural, law, and, transcendent, moral, order, hierarchy, and, organic, unity, agrarianism, classicism, and, high, culture, and, the, intersecting, spheres, of, loyalty, traditionalists, would, therefore, reject, the, notions, of, individualism, liberalism, modernity, and, social, progress, but, promote, cultural, and, educational, renewal, and, revive, interest, in, the, church, the, family, the, state, and, local, community, this, view, has, been, criticised, for, including, in, its, notion, of, tradition, practices, which, are, no, longer, considered, to, be, desirable, for, example, stereotypical, views, of, the, place, of, women, in, domestic, affairs, in, other, societies, especially, ones, experiencing, rapid, social, change, the, idea, of, what, is, traditional, may, be, widely, contested, with, different, groups, striving, to, establish, their, own, values, as, the, legitimate, traditional, ones, defining, and, enacting, traditions, in, some, cases, can, be, the, means, of, building, unity, between, subgroups, in, a, diverse, society, in, other, cases, tradition, is, a, means, of, othering, and, keeping, groups, distinct, from, one, another, in, artistic, contexts, in, the, performance, of, traditional, genres, such, as, traditional, dance, adherence, to, traditional, guidelines, is, of, greater, importance, than, performer, s, preferences, it, is, often, the, unchanging, form, of, certain, arts, that, leads, to, their, perception, as, traditional, for, artistic, endeavors, tradition, has, been, used, as, a, contrast, to, creativity, with, traditional, and, folk, art, associated, with, unoriginal, imitation, or, repetition, in, contrast, to, fine, art, which, is, valued, for, being, original, and, unique, more, recent, philosophy, of, art, however, considers, interaction, with, tradition, as, integral, to, the, development, of, new, artistic, expression, in, the, social, sciences, tradition, is, often, contrasted, with, modernity, particularly, in, terms, of, whole, societies, this, dichotomy, is, generally, associated, with, a, linear, model, of, social, change, in, which, societies, progress, from, being, traditional, to, being, modern, tradition, oriented, societies, have, been, characterized, as, valuing, filial, piety, harmony, and, group, welfare, stability, and, interdependence, while, a, society, exhibiting, modernity, would, value, individualism, with, free, will, and, choice, mobility, and, progress, another, author, discussing, tradition, in, relationship, to, modernity, anthony, giddens, sees, tradition, as, something, bound, to, ritual, where, ritual, guarantees, the, continuation, of, tradition, gusfield, and, others, though, criticize, this, dichotomy, as, oversimplified, arguing, that, tradition, is, dynamic, heterogeneous, and, coexists, successfully, with, modernity, even, within, individuals, tradition, should, be, differentiated, from, customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules, and, similar, concepts, whereas, tradition, is, supposed, to, be, invariable, they, are, seen, as, more, flexible, and, subject, to, innovation, and, change, whereas, justification, for, tradition, is, ideological, the, justification, for, other, similar, concepts, is, more, practical, or, technical, over, time, customs, routines, conventions, rules, and, such, can, evolve, into, traditions, but, that, usually, requires, that, they, stop, having, primarily, a, practical, purpose, for, example, wigs, worn, by, lawyers, were, at, first, common, and, fashionable, spurs, worn, by, military, officials, were, at, first, practical, but, now, are, both, impractical, and, traditional, the, legal, protection, of, tradition, includes, a, number, of, international, agreements, and, national, laws, in, addition, to, the, fundamental, protection, of, cultural, property, there, is, also, cooperation, between, the, united, nations, unesco, and, blue, shield, international, in, the, protection, or, recording, of, traditions, and, customs, the, protection, of, culture, and, traditions, is, becoming, increasingly, important, nationally, and, internationally, in, many, countries, concerted, attempts, are, being, made, to, preserve, traditions, that, are, at, risk, of, being, lost, a, number, of, factors, can, exacerbate, the, loss, of, tradition, including, industrialization, globalization, and, the, assimilation, or, marginalization, of, specific, cultural, groups, customary, celebrations, and, lifestyles, are, among, the, traditions, that, are, sought, to, be, preserved, likewise, the, concept, of, tradition, has, been, used, to, defend, the, preservation, and, reintroduction, of, minority, languages, such, as, cornish, under, the, auspices, of, the, european, charter, for, regional, or, minority, languages, specifically, the, charter, holds, that, these, languages, contribute, to, the, maintenance, and, development, of, europe, s, cultural, wealth, and, traditions, the, charter, goes, on, to, call, for, the, use, or, adoption, of, traditional, and, correct, forms, of, place, names, in, regional, or, minority, languages, similarly, unesco, includes, both, oral, tradition, and, traditional, manifestations, in, its, definition, of, a, country, s, cultural, properties, and, heritage, so, therefore, it, works, to, preserve, tradition, in, countries, such, as, brazil, in, japan, certain, artworks, structures, craft, techniques, and, performing, arts, are, considered, by, the, japanese, government, to, be, a, precious, legacy, of, the, japanese, people, and, are, protected, under, the, japanese, law, for, the, protection, of, cultural, properties, this, law, also, identifies, people, skilled, at, traditional, arts, as, national, living, treasures, and, encourages, the, preservation, of, their, craft, for, native, peoples, like, the, m, ori, in, new, zealand, there, is, conflict, between, the, fluid, identity, assumed, as, part, of, modern, society, and, the, traditional, identity, with, the, obligations, that, accompany, it, the, loss, of, language, heightens, the, feeling, of, isolation, and, damages, the, ability, to, perpetuate, tradition, the, phrase, traditional, cultural, expressions, is, used, by, the, world, intellectual, property, organization, to, refer, to, any, form, of, artistic, and, literary, expression, in, which, traditional, culture, and, knowledge, are, embodied, they, are, transmitted, from, one, generation, to, the, next, and, include, handmade, textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms, and, dance
