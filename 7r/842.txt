a, caste, is, a, fixed, social, group, into, which, an, individual, is, born, within, a, particular, system, of, social, stratification, a, caste, system, within, such, a, system, individuals, are, expected, to, marry, exclusively, within, the, same, caste, endogamy, follow, lifestyles, often, linked, to, a, particular, occupation, hold, a, ritual, status, observed, within, a, hierarchy, and, interact, with, others, based, on, cultural, notions, of, exclusion, with, certain, castes, considered, as, either, more, pure, or, more, polluted, than, others, the, term, caste, is, also, applied, to, morphological, groupings, in, eusocial, insects, such, as, ants, bees, and, termites, the, paradigmatic, ethnographic, example, of, caste, is, the, division, of, india, s, hindu, society, into, rigid, social, groups, its, roots, lie, in, south, asia, s, ancient, history, and, it, still, exists, however, the, economic, significance, of, the, caste, system, in, india, has, been, declining, as, a, result, of, urbanisation, and, affirmative, action, programs, a, subject, of, much, scholarship, by, sociologists, and, anthropologists, the, hindu, caste, system, is, sometimes, used, as, an, analogical, basis, for, the, study, of, caste, like, social, divisions, existing, outside, hinduism, and, india, in, colonial, spanish, america, mixed, race, castas, were, a, category, within, the, hispanic, sector, but, the, social, order, was, otherwise, fluid, the, english, word, caste, k, s, t, k, s, t, derives, from, the, spanish, and, portuguese, casta, which, according, to, the, john, minsheu, s, spanish, dictionary, 1569, means, race, lineage, tribe, or, breed, when, the, spanish, colonised, the, new, world, they, used, the, word, to, mean, a, clan, or, lineage, it, was, however, the, portuguese, who, first, employed, casta, in, the, primary, modern, sense, of, the, english, word, caste, when, they, applied, it, to, the, thousands, of, endogamous, hereditary, indian, social, groups, they, encountered, upon, their, arrival, in, india, in, 1498, the, use, of, the, spelling, caste, with, this, latter, meaning, is, first, attested, in, english, in, 1613, in, the, latin, american, context, the, term, caste, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, the, casta, system, of, racial, classification, based, on, whether, a, person, was, of, pure, european, indigenous, or, african, descent, or, some, mix, thereof, with, the, different, groups, being, placed, in, a, racial, hierarchy, however, despite, the, etymological, connection, between, the, latin, american, casta, system, and, south, asian, caste, systems, the, former, giving, its, name, to, the, latter, it, is, controversial, to, what, extent, the, two, phenomena, are, really, comparable, modern, india, s, caste, system, is, based, on, the, superimposition, of, an, old, four, fold, theoretical, classification, called, varna, on, the, social, ethnic, grouping, called, j, ti, the, vedic, period, conceptualised, a, society, as, consisting, of, four, types, of, varnas, or, categories, brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and, shudra, according, to, the, nature, of, the, work, of, its, members, varna, was, not, an, inherited, category, and, the, occupation, determined, the, varna, however, a, person, s, jati, is, determined, at, birth, and, makes, them, take, up, that, jati, s, occupation, members, could, and, did, change, their, occupation, based, on, personal, strengths, as, well, as, economic, social, and, political, factors, a, 2016, study, based, on, the, dna, analysis, of, unrelated, indians, determined, that, endogamous, jatis, originated, during, the, gupta, empire, from, 1901, onwards, for, the, purposes, of, the, decennial, census, the, british, colonial, authorities, arbitrarily, and, incorrectly, forced, all, j, tis, into, the, four, varna, categories, as, described, in, ancient, texts, herbert, hope, risley, the, census, commissioner, noted, that, the, principle, suggested, as, a, basis, was, that, of, classification, by, social, precedence, as, recognized, by, native, public, opinion, at, the, present, day, and, manifesting, itself, in, the, facts, that, particular, castes, are, supposed, to, be, the, modern, representatives, of, one, or, other, of, the, castes, of, the, theoretical, indian, system, varna, as, mentioned, in, ancient, hindu, texts, describes, society, as, divided, into, four, categories, brahmins, scholars, and, yajna, priests, kshatriyas, rulers, and, warriors, vaishyas, farmers, merchants, and, artisans, and, shudras, workmen, service, providers, the, texts, do, not, mention, any, hierarchy, or, a, separate, untouchable, category, in, varna, classifications, scholars, believe, that, the, varnas, system, was, never, truly, operational, in, society, and, there, is, no, evidence, of, it, ever, being, a, reality, in, indian, history, the, practical, division, of, the, society, had, always, been, in, terms, of, jatis, birth, groups, which, are, not, based, on, any, specific, religious, principle, but, could, vary, from, ethnic, origins, to, occupations, to, geographic, areas, the, j, tis, have, been, endogamous, social, groups, without, any, fixed, hierarchy, but, subject, to, vague, notions, of, rank, articulated, over, time, based, on, lifestyle, and, social, political, or, economic, status, many, of, india, s, major, empires, and, dynasties, like, the, mauryas, shalivahanas, chalukyas, kakatiyas, among, many, others, were, founded, by, people, who, would, have, been, classified, as, shudras, under, the, varnas, system, as, interpreted, by, the, british, rulers, it, is, well, established, that, by, the, 9th, century, kings, from, all, the, four, varnas, including, brahmins, and, vaishyas, had, occupied, the, highest, seat, in, the, monarchical, system, in, hindu, india, contrary, to, the, varna, theory, in, many, instances, as, in, bengal, historically, the, kings, and, rulers, had, been, called, upon, when, required, to, mediate, on, the, ranks, of, j, tis, which, might, number, in, thousands, all, over, the, subcontinent, and, vary, by, region, in, practice, the, j, tis, may, or, may, not, fit, into, the, varna, classes, and, many, prominent, jatis, for, example, the, jats, and, yadavs, straddled, two, varnas, i, e, kshatriyas, and, vaishyas, and, the, varna, status, of, j, tis, itself, was, subject, to, articulation, over, time, starting, with, the, 1901, census, of, india, led, by, colonial, administrator, herbert, hope, risley, all, the, j, tis, were, grouped, under, the, theoretical, varnas, categories, according, to, political, scientist, lloyd, rudolph, risley, believed, that, varna, however, ancient, could, be, applied, to, all, the, modern, castes, found, in, india, and, meant, to, identify, and, place, several, hundred, million, indians, within, it, the, terms, varna, conceptual, classification, based, on, occupation, and, j, ti, groups, are, two, distinct, concepts, while, varna, is, a, theoretical, four, part, division, j, ti, community, refers, to, the, thousands, of, actual, endogamous, social, groups, prevalent, across, the, subcontinent, the, classical, authors, scarcely, speak, of, anything, other, than, the, varnas, as, it, provided, a, convenient, shorthand, but, a, problem, arises, when, colonial, indologists, sometimes, confuse, the, two, upon, independence, from, britain, the, indian, constitution, listed, 1, 108, jatis, across, the, country, as, scheduled, castes, in, 1950, for, positive, discrimination, this, constitution, would, also, ban, discrimination, of, the, basis, of, the, caste, though, its, practice, in, india, remained, intact, the, untouchable, communities, are, sometimes, called, scheduled, castes, dalit, or, harijan, in, contemporary, literature, in, 2001, dalits, were, 16, 2, of, india, s, population, most, of, the, 15, million, bonded, child, workers, are, from, the, lowest, castes, independent, india, has, witnessed, caste, related, violence, in, 2005, government, recorded, approximately, 110, 000, cases, of, reported, violent, acts, including, rape, and, murder, against, dalits, the, socio, economic, limitations, of, the, caste, system, are, reduced, due, to, urbanisation, and, affirmative, action, nevertheless, the, caste, system, still, exists, in, endogamy, and, patrimony, and, thrives, in, the, politics, of, democracy, where, caste, provides, ready, made, constituencies, to, politicians, the, globalisation, and, economic, opportunities, from, foreign, businesses, has, influenced, the, growth, of, india, s, middle, class, population, some, members, of, the, chhattisgarh, potter, caste, community, cpcc, are, middle, class, urban, professionals, and, no, longer, potters, unlike, the, remaining, majority, of, traditional, rural, potter, members, there, is, persistence, of, caste, in, indian, politics, caste, associations, have, evolved, into, caste, based, political, parties, political, parties, and, the, state, perceive, caste, as, an, important, factor, for, mobilisation, of, people, and, policy, development, studies, by, bhatt, and, beteille, have, shown, changes, in, status, openness, mobility, in, the, social, aspects, of, indian, society, as, a, result, of, modern, socio, economic, changes, in, the, country, india, is, experiencing, significant, changes, in, the, dynamics, and, the, economics, of, its, social, sphere, while, arranged, marriages, are, still, the, most, common, practice, in, india, the, internet, has, provided, a, network, for, younger, indians, to, take, control, of, their, relationships, through, the, use, of, dating, apps, this, remains, isolated, to, informal, terms, as, marriage, is, not, often, achieved, through, the, use, of, these, apps, hypergamy, is, still, a, common, practice, in, india, and, hindu, culture, men, are, expected, to, marry, within, their, caste, or, one, below, with, no, social, repercussions, if, a, woman, marries, into, a, higher, caste, then, her, children, will, take, the, status, of, their, father, if, she, marries, down, her, family, is, reduced, to, the, social, status, of, their, son, in, law, in, this, case, the, women, are, bearers, of, the, egalitarian, principle, of, the, marriage, there, would, be, no, benefit, in, marrying, a, higher, caste, if, the, terms, of, the, marriage, did, not, imply, equality, however, men, are, systematically, shielded, from, the, negative, implications, of, the, agreement, geographical, factors, also, determine, adherence, to, the, caste, system, many, northern, villages, are, more, likely, to, participate, in, exogamous, marriage, due, to, a, lack, of, eligible, suitors, within, the, same, caste, women, in, north, india, have, been, found, to, be, less, likely, to, leave, or, divorce, their, husbands, since, they, are, of, a, relatively, lower, caste, system, and, have, higher, restrictions, on, their, freedoms, on, the, other, hand, pahari, women, of, the, northern, mountains, have, much, more, freedom, to, leave, their, husbands, without, stigma, this, often, leads, to, better, husbandry, as, his, actions, are, not, protected, by, social, expectations, chiefly, among, the, factors, influencing, the, rise, of, exogamy, is, the, rapid, urbanisation, in, india, experienced, over, the, last, century, it, is, well, known, that, urban, centers, tend, to, be, less, reliant, on, agriculture, and, are, more, progressive, as, a, whole, as, india, s, cities, boomed, in, population, the, job, market, grew, to, keep, pace, prosperity, and, stability, were, now, more, easily, attained, by, an, individual, and, the, anxiety, to, marry, quickly, and, effectively, was, reduced, thus, younger, more, progressive, generations, of, urban, indians, are, less, likely, than, ever, to, participate, in, the, antiquated, system, of, arranged, endogamy, india, has, also, implemented, a, form, of, affirmative, action, locally, known, as, reservation, groups, quota, system, jobs, as, well, as, placements, in, publicly, funded, colleges, hold, spots, for, the, 8, of, india, s, minority, and, underprivileged, groups, as, a, result, in, states, such, as, tamil, nadu, or, those, in, the, north, east, where, underprivileged, populations, predominate, over, 80, of, government, jobs, are, set, aside, in, quotas, in, education, colleges, lower, the, marks, necessary, for, the, dalits, to, enter, the, nepali, caste, system, resembles, in, some, respects, the, indian, j, ti, system, with, numerous, j, ti, divisions, with, a, varna, system, superimposed, inscriptions, attest, the, beginnings, of, a, caste, system, during, the, licchavi, period, jayasthiti, malla, 1382, 1395, categorised, newars, into, 64, castes, gellner, 2001, a, similar, exercise, was, made, during, the, reign, of, mahindra, malla, 1506, 1575, the, hindu, social, code, was, later, set, up, in, the, gorkha, kingdom, by, ram, shah, 1603, 1636, mckim, marriott, claims, a, social, stratification, that, is, hierarchical, closed, endogamous, and, hereditary, is, widely, prevalent, particularly, in, western, parts, of, pakistan, frederik, barth, in, his, review, of, this, system, of, social, stratification, in, pakistan, suggested, that, these, are, castes, the, caste, system, in, sri, lanka, is, a, division, of, society, into, strata, influenced, by, the, textbook, j, ti, system, found, in, india, ancient, sri, lankan, texts, such, as, the, pujavaliya, sadharmaratnavaliya, and, yogaratnakaraya, and, inscriptional, evidence, show, that, the, above, hierarchy, prevailed, throughout, the, feudal, period, the, repetition, of, the, same, caste, hierarchy, even, as, recently, as, the, 18th, century, in, the, kandyan, period, kadayimpoth, boundary, books, as, well, indicates, the, continuation, of, the, tradition, right, up, to, the, end, of, sri, lanka, s, monarchy, balinese, caste, structure, has, been, described, as, being, based, either, on, three, categories, the, noble, triwangsa, thrice, born, the, middle, class, of, dwij, ti, twice, born, and, the, lower, class, of, ekaj, ti, once, born, much, similar, to, the, traditional, indian, bkvs, social, stratification, or, on, four, castes, the, brahmana, caste, was, further, subdivided, by, dutch, ethnographers, into, two, siwa, and, buda, the, siwa, caste, was, subdivided, into, five, kemenuh, keniten, mas, manuba, and, petapan, this, classification, was, to, accommodate, the, observed, marriage, between, higher, caste, brahmana, men, with, lower, caste, women, the, other, castes, were, similarly, further, sub, classified, by, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, ethnographers, based, on, numerous, criteria, ranging, from, profession, endogamy, or, exogamy, or, polygamy, and, a, host, of, other, factors, in, a, manner, similar, to, castas, in, spanish, colonies, such, as, mexico, and, caste, system, studies, in, british, colonies, such, as, india, in, the, philippines, pre, colonial, societies, do, not, have, a, single, social, structure, the, class, structures, can, be, roughly, categorised, into, four, types, during, the, period, of, the, yuan, dynasty, ruler, kublai, khan, enforced, a, four, class, system, which, was, a, legal, caste, system, the, order, of, four, classes, of, people, in, descending, order, were, there, is, significant, controversy, over, the, social, classes, of, tibet, especially, with, regards, to, the, serfdom, in, tibet, controversy, heidi, fjeld, has, put, forth, the, argument, that, pre, 1950s, tibetan, society, was, functionally, a, caste, system, in, contrast, to, previous, scholars, who, defined, the, tibetan, social, class, system, as, similar, to, european, feudal, serfdom, as, well, as, non, scholarly, western, accounts, which, seek, to, romanticise, a, supposedly, egalitarian, ancient, tibetan, society, in, japan, s, history, social, strata, based, on, inherited, position, rather, than, personal, merit, were, rigid, and, highly, formalised, in, a, system, called, mibunsei, at, the, top, were, the, emperor, and, court, nobles, kuge, together, with, the, sh, gun, and, daimy, older, scholars, believed, that, there, were, shi, n, k, sh, four, classes, of, samurai, peasants, hyakush, craftsmen, and, merchants, ch, nin, under, the, daimyo, with, 80, of, peasants, under, the, 5, samurai, class, followed, by, craftsmen, and, merchants, however, various, studies, have, revealed, since, about, 1995, that, the, classes, of, peasants, craftsmen, and, merchants, under, the, samurai, are, equal, and, the, old, hierarchy, chart, has, been, removed, from, japanese, history, textbooks, in, other, words, peasants, craftsmen, and, merchants, are, not, a, social, pecking, order, but, a, social, classification, marriage, between, certain, classes, was, generally, prohibited, in, particular, marriage, between, daimyo, and, court, nobles, was, forbidden, by, the, tokugawa, shogunate, because, it, could, lead, to, political, maneuvering, for, the, same, reason, marriages, between, daimyo, and, high, ranking, hatamoto, of, the, samurai, class, required, the, approval, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, it, was, also, forbidden, for, a, member, of, the, samurai, class, to, marry, a, peasant, craftsman, or, merchant, but, this, was, done, through, a, loophole, in, which, a, person, from, a, lower, class, was, adopted, into, the, samurai, class, and, then, married, since, there, was, an, economic, advantage, for, a, poor, samurai, class, person, to, marry, a, wealthy, merchant, or, peasant, class, woman, they, would, adopt, a, merchant, or, peasant, class, woman, into, the, samurai, class, as, an, adopted, daughter, and, then, marry, her, japan, had, its, own, untouchable, caste, shunned, and, ostracised, historically, referred, to, by, the, insulting, term, eta, now, called, burakumin, while, modern, law, has, officially, abolished, the, class, hierarchy, there, are, reports, of, discrimination, against, the, buraku, or, burakumin, underclasses, the, burakumin, are, regarded, as, ostracised, the, burakumin, are, one, of, the, main, minority, groups, in, japan, along, with, the, ainu, of, hokkaid, and, those, of, korean, or, chinese, descent, the, baekjeong, were, an, untouchable, outcaste, of, korea, the, meaning, today, is, that, of, butcher, it, originates, in, the, khitan, invasion, of, korea, in, the, 11th, century, the, defeated, khitans, who, surrendered, were, settled, in, isolated, communities, throughout, goryeo, to, forestall, rebellion, they, were, valued, for, their, skills, in, hunting, herding, butchering, and, making, of, leather, common, skill, sets, among, nomads, over, time, their, ethnic, origin, was, forgotten, and, they, formed, the, bottom, layer, of, korean, society, in, 1392, with, the, foundation, of, the, confucian, joseon, dynasty, korea, systemised, its, own, native, class, system, at, the, top, were, the, two, official, classes, the, yangban, which, literally, means, two, classes, it, was, composed, of, scholars, munban, and, warriors, muban, scholars, had, a, significant, social, advantage, over, the, warriors, below, were, the, jung, in, literally, middle, people, this, was, a, small, class, of, specialised, professions, such, as, medicine, accounting, translators, regional, bureaucrats, etc, below, that, were, the, sangmin, literally, commoner, farmers, working, their, own, fields, korea, also, had, a, serf, population, known, as, the, nobi, the, nobi, population, could, fluctuate, up, to, about, one, third, of, the, population, but, on, average, the, nobi, made, up, about, 10, of, the, total, population, in, 1801, the, vast, majority, of, government, nobi, were, emancipated, and, by, 1858, the, nobi, population, stood, at, about, 1, 5, of, the, total, population, of, korea, the, hereditary, nobi, system, was, officially, abolished, around, 1886, 87, and, the, rest, of, the, nobi, system, was, abolished, with, the, gabo, reform, of, 1894, but, traces, remained, until, 1930, the, opening, of, korea, to, foreign, christian, missionary, activity, in, the, late, 19th, century, saw, some, improvement, in, the, status, of, the, baekjeong, however, everyone, was, not, equal, under, the, christian, congregation, and, even, so, protests, erupted, when, missionaries, tried, to, integrate, baekjeong, into, worship, with, non, baekjeong, finding, this, attempt, insensitive, to, traditional, notions, of, hierarchical, advantage, around, the, same, time, the, baekjeong, began, to, resist, open, social, discrimination, they, focused, on, social, and, economic, injustices, affecting, them, hoping, to, create, an, egalitarian, korean, society, their, efforts, included, attacking, social, discrimination, by, upper, class, authorities, and, commoners, and, the, use, of, degrading, language, against, children, in, public, schools, with, the, gabo, reform, of, 1896, the, class, system, of, korea, was, officially, abolished, following, the, collapse, of, the, gabo, government, the, new, cabinet, which, became, the, gwangmu, government, after, the, establishment, of, the, korean, empire, introduced, systematic, measures, for, abolishing, the, traditional, class, system, one, measure, was, the, new, household, registration, system, reflecting, the, goals, of, formal, social, equality, which, was, implemented, by, the, loyalists, cabinet, whereas, the, old, registration, system, signified, household, members, according, to, their, hierarchical, social, status, the, new, system, called, for, an, occupation, while, most, koreans, by, then, had, surnames, and, even, bongwan, although, still, substantial, number, of, cheonmin, mostly, consisted, of, serfs, and, slaves, and, untouchables, did, not, according, to, the, new, system, they, were, then, required, to, fill, in, the, blanks, for, surname, in, order, to, be, registered, as, constituting, separate, households, instead, of, creating, their, own, family, name, some, cheonmins, appropriated, their, masters, surname, while, others, simply, took, the, most, common, surname, and, its, bongwan, in, the, local, area, along, with, this, example, activists, within, and, outside, the, korean, government, had, based, their, visions, of,

rights, in, north, korea, reported, that, every, north, korean, citizen, is, assigned, a, heredity, based, class, and, socio, political, rank, over, which, the, individual, exercises, no, control, but, which, determines, all, aspects, of, his, or, her, life, called, songbun, barbara, demick, describes, this, class, structure, as, an, updating, of, the, hereditary, caste, system, a, combination, of, confucianism, and, communism, it, originated, in, 1946, and, was, entrenched, by, the, 1960s, and, consisted, of, 53, categories, ranging, across, three, classes, loyal, wavering, and, impure,

religious, features, which, make, up, the, system, whereas, in, the, united, states, race, and, color, are, the, basis, for, differentiation, the, caste, systems, in, india, and, the, united, states, have, higher, groups, which, desire, to, retain, their, positions, for, themselves, and, thus, perpetuate, the, two, systems, the, process, of, creating, a, homogenized, society, by, social, engineering, in, both, india, and, the, southern, us, has, created, other, institutions, that, have, made, class, distinctions, among, different, groups, evident, anthropologist, james, c, scott,

street, with, only, rare, but, commonly, touted, exceptions, to, lasting, personal, success, such, as, maggie, walker, annie, malone, and, madame, c, j, walker, parts, of, the, united, states, are, sometimes, divided, by, race, and, class, status, despite, the, national, narrative, of, integration, a, survey, on, caste, discrimination, conducted, by, equality, labs, found, 67, of, indian, dalits, living, in, the, us, reporting, that, they, faced, caste, based, harassment, at, the, workplace, and, 27, reporting, verbal, or, physical, assault, based, on, their, caste, however, the, carnegie, endowment, for, international, peace, study, in, 2021, criticizes, equality, labs, findings, and, methodology, noting, equality, labs, study, relied, on, a, nonrepresentative, snowball, sampling, method, to, recruit, respondents, furthermore, respondents, who, did, not, disclose, a, caste, identity, were, dropped, from, the, data, set, therefore, it, is, likely, that, the, sample, does, not, fully, represent, the, south, asian, american, population, and, could, skew, in, favor, of, those, who, have, strong, views, about, caste, while, the, existence, of, caste, discrimination, in, india, is, incontrovertible, its, precise, extent, and, intensity, in, the, united, states, can, be, contested, in, 2023, seattle, became, the, first, city, in, the, united, states, to, ban, discrimination, based, on, caste, racial, casteism, is, a, term, used, to, identify, the, relationship, between, caste, race, and, colorism, in, modern, day, india, the, caste, system, has, expanded, to, include, groups, and, identities, from, diasporic, groups, as, well, such, as, the, africana, siddis, and, kaffirs, siddis, make, up, 40, 000, of, india, s, vast, population, and, are, perceived, as, untouchables, under, the, caste, framework, this, categorization, is, paired, with, anti, black, ideology, in, the, country, that, is, often, adapted, by, broader, uses, of, the, term, caste, in, western, countries, most, notably, the, united, states, like, the, siddis, africana, caste, sri, lanka, kaffirs, make, up, a, small, minority, of, the, population, with, scholars, noting, that, the, exact, number, is, hard, to, determine, due, to, exclusion, and, lack, of, recognition, from, the, government, siddis, and, kaffirs, are, considered, untouchables, due, to, their, darker, skin, color, alongside, other, physical, factors, that, distinguish, the, group, as, lower, caste, the, migration, of, africana, groups, such, as, the, siddis, and, kaffirs, to, south, asia, is, widely, considered, to, be, a, result, of, the, indian, ocean, slave, trade, initiated, by, muslim, arabs, during, the, trade, enslaved, africans, were, often, brought, as, court, servants, herbalists, midwives, or, as, bonded, labor, the, limited, awareness, of, these, groups, can, be, attributed, to, caste, ideology, fueled, from, this, trade, the, racial, understanding, of, caste, has, largely, been, debated, by, scholars, with, some, like, dr, b, r, ambedkar, arguing, that, caste, differences, between, higher, caste, aryans, and, lower, cast, native, indians, being, more, due, to, religious, factors, while, the, term, remains, contended, it, is, widely, understood, that, this, racial, assessment, is, based, on, the, way, lower, caste, people, are, treated, africana, diasporic, groups, who, do, not, fit, the, caste, system, reflected, by, the, scheduled, tribe, are, thus, considered, inferior, for, their, darker, skin, and, grouped, in, with, the, untouchables, since, caste, is, inherited, at, birth, and, is, inflexible, to, change, throughout, a, lifetime, this, can, lead, to, a, racial, caste, system, where, colorism, largely, influences, the, mobility, one, has, in, their, lifetime, terminology, shifted, away, from, race, conscious, terms, in, south, asian, antiquity, where, aryans, had, pre, conceived, social, hierarchies, built, off, of, race, to, a, caste, framework, during, buddhism, s, rise, in, the, third, century, bce, racial, caste, is, embedded, in, the, institutions, that, make, up, south, asia, particularly, its, governing, bodies, when, it, comes, to, the, electorate, of, india, voter, preference, is, often, based, on, race, caste, religion, alongside, other, attributing, physical, and, political, factors, this, power, imbalance, alongside, the, rigid, nature, of, caste, can, work, against, those, of, darker, skin, complexion, to, hold, positions, of, power, the, foundational, divisions, of, caste, have, historically, been, seen, as, a, determining, factor, in, one, s, skills, and, career, prospects, today, many, people, perceive, higher, education, as, a, means, of, achieving, their, own, professional, goals, but, there, are, still, methods, based, on, caste, assumptions, used, to, keep, lower, caste, out, of, universities, this, leads, to, their, exclusion, from, the, potential, to, be, part, of, higher, paying, jobs, that, are, perceived, as, more, elite, this, social, expectation, and, prevention, of, access, to, education, and, opportunity, have, elongated, the, struggle, for, financial, and, social, equity, amongst, people, from, scheduled, tribes, and, castes, affirmative, action, has, been, a, global, phenomenon, to, develop, more, spaces, in, politics, jobs, and, education, for, people, from, historically, disadvantaged, backgrounds, which, has, led, to, the, reservation, system, being, applied, to, universities, even, with, these, regulations, caste, nevertheless, remains, a, largely, determining, factor, in, the, university, system, in, india, the, guarantee, of, admittance, to, a, certain, proportion, of, people, from, oppressed, castes, is, not, enough, to, deal, with, the, implications, of, divisions, in, higher, education, for, example, the, reservation, percentage, can, vary, by, state, but, is, generally, around, 15, for, scheduled, castes, but, 2019, 20, data, shows, most, universities, miss, this, mark, across, the, board, there, is, an, average, of, 14, 7, of, scheduled, caste, students, meaning, many, universities, are, at, a, far, lower, rate, than, legislated, these, reservation, systems, have, backlash, from, upper, caste, groups, who, claim, that, people, are, only, admitted, due, to, their, caste, status, as, opposed, to, merit, in, a, similar, argument, playing, out, to, affirmative, action, in, the, united, states, reservation, policies, constitute, a, first, step, in, providing, access, to, admittance, into, higher, education, opportunities, but, do, not, overcome, the, overarching, challenge, of, casteism, caste, based, discrimination, and, social, stigma, can, still, affect, the, experiences, of, students, from, marginalized, communities, in, academic, institutions, universities, are, a, crucial, place, of, integration, and, moving, to, offer, equitable, opportunity, beyond, just, attendance, but, implementing, protective, policies, to, ensure, students, can, be, successful, attendance, at, university, has, already, been, shown, to, impact, how, people, view, caste, and, has, the, potential, to, shape, equity, building, beyond, the, current, interpersonal, and, systemic, relationship, several, forms, of, discrimination, manifest, in, universities, social, discrimination, students, from, marginalized, castes, face, social, discrimination, exclusion, and, or, isolation, on, campuses, this, affects, their, general, educational, experience, and, mental, well, being, numerous, cases, of, harassment, and, bullying, based, on, caste, lines, have, been, reported, with, drastic, consequences, for, the, victims, but, often, none, for, the, perpetrators, this, promotes, a, hostile, environment, for, students, and, hampers, their, ability, to, engage, positively, in, the, academic, community, when, i, was, enrolled, for, an, undergraduate, course, i, was, vocal, about, his,

observed, in, access, to, living, facilities, food, services, and, other, campus, amenities, students, from, marginalized, castes, may, encounter, difficulties, in, availing, of, these, services, without, bias, and, the, living, arrangements, are, often, internally, segregated, academic, faculty, discrimination, discrimination, may, extend, to, the, academic, sphere, with, students, facing,

biases, that, affect, their, interactions, with, students, this, comes, from, the, inherent, hierarchical, nature, of, caste, having, built, centuries, of, prejudice, against, lower, caste, and, indigenous, students, this, influences, academic, mentorship, guidance, and, opportunities, for, students, from, marginalized, backgrounds, eighty, four, percent, of, the, sc, st, students, surveyed, said, examiners, had, asked, them, about, their, caste, directly, or, indirectly, during, their, evaluations, one, student, said, teachers, are, fine, till, they, do, not, know, your, caste, the, moment, they, come, to, know, their, attitude, towards, you, changes, completely, due, to, the, challenges, experienced, on, top, of, the, normal, pressure, of, being, a, student, the, discrimination, that, dalits, and, people, of, obcs, face, has, led, to, increased, rates, of, suicide, with, numerous, examples, shown, to, be, tied, directly, to, campus, harassment, and, lack, of, administrative, support, the, clarity, that, comes, from, people, sharing, their, experiences, has, led, to, significant, pushback, in, the, 21st, century, where, students, have, been, centering, fights, for, justice, and, equity, often, based, on, movements, that, student, activists, of, the, past, have, used, allahabad, university, has, seen, a, spike, in, student, protests, and, demonstrations, against, institutional, discrimination, students, used, tactics, of, information, spreading, from, pamphlets, and, court, cases, to, public, civil, disobedience, through, marches, and, sit, ins, to, disrupt, the, flow, of, university, life, and, lead, to, broader, discussions, the, student, unrest, was, not, unique, to, allahabad, university, but, was, strong, enough, to, last, over, 90, days, the, initial, observational, studies, of, the, division, of, labour, in, ant, colonies, attempted, to, demonstrate, that, ants, specialized, in, tasks, that, were, best, suited, to, their, size, when, they, emerged, from, the, pupae, stage, into, the, adult, stage, a, large, proportion, of, the, experimental, work, was, done, in, species, that, showed, strong, variation, in, size, as, the, size, of, an, adult, was, fixed, for, life, workers, of, a, specific, size, range, came, to, be, called, a, caste, calling, up, the, traditional, caste, system, in, india, in, which, a, human, s, standing, in, society, was, decided, at, birth, the, notion, of, caste, encouraged, a, link, between, scholarship, in, entomology, and, sociology, because, it, served, as, an, example, of, a, division, of, labour, in, which, the, participants, seemed, to, be, uncompromisingly, adapted, to, special, functions, and, sometimes, even, unique, environments, to, bolster, the, concept, of, caste, entomologists, and, sociologists, referred, to, the, complementary, social, or, natural, parallel, and, thereby, appeared, to, generalize, the, concept, and, give, it, an, appearance, of, familiarity, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, perceived, similarities, between, the, indian, caste, system, and, caste, polymorphism, in, insects, were, used, to, create, a, correspondence, or, parallelism, for, the, purpose, of, explaining, or, clarifying, racial, stratification, in, human, societies, the, explanations, came, particularly, to, be, employed, in, the, united, states, ideas, from, heredity, and, natural, selection, influenced, some, sociologists, who, believed, that, some, groups, were, predetermined, to, belong, to, a, lower, social, or, occupational, status, chiefly, through, the, work, of, w, lloyd, warner, at, the, university, of, chicago, a, group, of, sociologists, sharing, similar, principles, came, to, evolve, around, the, creed, of, caste, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, ecologically, oriented, sociologist, robert, e, park, although, attributing, more, weight, to, environmental, explanations, than, the, biological, nonetheless, believed, that, there, were, obstacles, to, the, assimilation, of, blacks, into, american, society, and, that, an, accommodation, stage, in, a, biracially, organized, caste, system, was, required, before, full, assimilation, he, did, disavow, his, position, in, 1937, suggesting, that, blacks, were, a, minority, and, not, a, caste, the, indian, sociologist, radhakamal, mukerjee, was, influenced, by, robert, e, park, and, adopted, the, concept, of, caste, to, describe, race, relations, in, the, us, according, to, anthropologist, diane, rodgers, mukerjee, proceeded, to, suggest, that, a, caste, system, should, be, correctly, instituted, in, the, us, south, to, ease, race, relations, mukerjee, often, employed, both, entomological, and, sociological, data, and, clues, to, describe, caste, systems, he, wrote, while, the, fundamental, industries, of, man, are, dispersed, throughout, the, insect, world, the, same, kind, of, polymorphism, appears, again, and, again, in, different, species, of, social, insects, which, have, reacted, in, the, same, manner, as, man, under, the, influence, of, the, same, environment, to, ensure, the, supply, and, provision, of, subsistence, comparing, the, caste, system, in, india, to, caste, polymorphism, in, insects, he, noted, where, we, find, the, organization, of, social, insects, developed, to, perfection, there, also, has, been, seen, among, human, associations, a, minute, and, even, rigid, specialization, of, functions, along, with, ant, and, bee, like, societal, integrity, and, cohesiveness, he, considered, the, resemblances, between, insect, associations, and, caste, ridden, societies, to, be, striking, enough, to, be, amusing
