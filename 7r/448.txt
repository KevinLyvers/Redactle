tillaberi, tahoua, dosso, maradi, agadez, and, zinder, regions, while, mutually, comprehensible, with, other, dialects, especially, sakkwatanci, and, to, a, lesser, extent, gaananci, the, northernmost, dialects, have, slight, grammatical, and, lexical, differences, owing, to, frequent, contact, with, the, zarma, fula, and, tuareg, groups, and, cultural, changes, owing, to, the, geographical, differences, between, the, grassland, and, desert, zones, these, dialects, also, have, the, quality, of, bordering, on, non, tonal, pitch, accent, dialects, this, link, between, non, tonality, and, geographic, location, is, not, limited, to, hausa, alone, but, is, exhibited, in, other, northern, dialects, of, neighbouring, languages, example, includes, differences, within, the,

outside, the, contiguous, hausa, dominant, area, and, is, usually, identified, by, the, use, of, c, for, ky, and, j, for, gy, this, is, attributed, to, the, fact, that, ghana, s, hausa, population, descend, from, hausa, fulani, traders, settled, in, the, zongo, districts, of, major, trade, towns, up, and, down, the, previous, asante, gonja, and, dagomba, kingdoms, stretching, from, the, sahel,

franca, of, what, become, predominantly, manding, areas, and, native, hausa, speakers, plummet, to, a, very, small, urban, minority, because, of, this, and, the, presence, of, surrounding, akan, gbe, gur, and, mande, languages, gaananci, was, historically, isolated, from, the, other, hausa, dialects, despite, this, difference, grammatical, similarities, between, sakkwatanci, and, ghanaian, hausa, determine, that, the, dialect, and, the, origin, of, the, ghanaian, hausa, people, themselves, are, derived, from, the, northwestern, hausa, area, surrounding, sokoto, hausa, is, also, widely, spoken, by, non, native, gur, and, mand, ghanaian, muslims, but, differs, from, gaananci, and, rather, has, features, consistent, with, non, native, hausa, dialects, hausa, is, also, spoken, in, various,

native, hausa, speakers, in, these, areas, in, west, africa, hausa, s, use, as, a, lingua, franca, has, given, rise, to, a, non, native, pronunciation, that, differs, vastly, from, native, pronunciation, by, way, of, key, omissions, of, implosive, and, ejective, consonants, present, in, native, hausa, dialects, such, as, and, k, which, are, pronounced, by, non, native, speakers, as, d, b, and, k, respectively, this, creates, confusion, among, non, native, and, native, hausa, speakers, as, non, native, pronunciation, does, not, distinguish, words, like, daidai, correct, and, ai, ai, one, by, one, another, difference, between, native, and, non, native, hausa, is, the, omission, of, vowel, length, in, words, and, change, in, the, standard, tone, of, native, hausa, dialects, ranging, from, native, fulani, and, tuareg, hausa, speakers, omitting, tone, altogether, to, hausa, speakers, with, gur, or, yoruba, mother, tongues, using, additional, tonal, structures, similar, to,
