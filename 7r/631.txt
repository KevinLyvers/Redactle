english, see, spelling, differences, is, the, process, of, interaction, and, integration, among, people, companies, and, governments, worldwide, the, term, globalization, first, appeared, in, the, early, 20th, century, supplanting, an, earlier, french, term, mondialisation, developed, its, current, meaning, sometime, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, came, into, popular, use, in, the, 1990s, to, describe, the, unprecedented, international, connectivity, of, the, post, cold, war, world, its, origins, can, be, traced, back, to, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, due, to, advances, in, transportation, and, communications, technology, this, increase, in, global, interactions, has, caused, a, growth, in, international, trade, and, the, exchange, of, ideas, beliefs, and, culture, globalization, is, primarily, an, economic, process, of, interaction, and, integration, that, is, associated, with, social, and, cultural, aspects, however, disputes, and, international, diplomacy, are, also, large, parts, of, the, history, of, globalization, and, of, modern, globalization, economically, globalization, involves, goods, services, data, technology, and, the, economic, resources, of, capital, the, expansion, of, global, markets, liberalizes, the, economic, activities, of, the, exchange, of, goods, and, funds, removal, of, cross, border, trade, barriers, has, made, the, formation, of, global, markets, more, feasible, advances, in, transportation, like, the, steam, locomotive, steamship, jet, engine, and, container, ships, and, developments, in, telecommunication, infrastructure, such, as, the, telegraph, the, internet, mobile, phones, and, smartphones, have, been, major, factors, in, globalization, and, have, generated, further, interdependence, of, economic, and, cultural, activities, around, the, globe, though, many, scholars, place, the, origins, of, globalization, in, modern, times, others, trace, its, history, to, long, before, the, european, age, of, discovery, and, voyages, to, the, new, world, and, some, even, to, the, third, millennium, bce, large, scale, globalization, began, in, the, 1820s, and, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, drove, a, rapid, expansion, in, the, connectivity, of, the, world, s, economies, and, cultures, the, term, global, city, was, subsequently, popularized, by, sociologist, saskia, sassen, in, her, work, the, global, city, new, york, london, tokyo, 1991, in, 2000, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, identified, four, basic, aspects, of, globalization, trade, and, transactions, capital, and, investment, movements, migration, and, movement, of, people, and, the, dissemination, of, knowledge, globalizing, processes, affect, and, are, affected, by, business, and, work, organization, economics, sociocultural, resources, and, the, natural, environment, academic, literature, commonly, divides, globalization, into, three, major, areas, economic, globalization, cultural, globalization, and, political, globalization, proponents, of, globalization, point, to, economic, growth, and, broader, societal, development, as, benefits, while, opponents, claim, globalizing, processes, are, detrimental, to, social, well, being, due, to, ethnocentrism, environmental, consequences, and, other, potential, drawbacks, the, word, globalization, was, used, in, the, english, language, as, early, as, the, 1930s, but, only, in, the, context, of, education, and, the, term, failed, to, gain, traction, over, the, next, few, decades, the, term, was, occasionally, used, by, other, scholars, and, media, but, it, was, not, clearly, defined, one, of, the, first, usages, of, the, term, in, the, meaning, resembling, the, later, common, usage, was, by, french, economist, fran, ois, perroux, in, his, essays, from, the, early, 1960s, in, his, french, works, he, used, the, term, mondialisation, literarly, worldization, in, french, also, translated, as, mundialization, theodore, levitt, is, often, credited, with, popularizing, the, term, and, bringing, it, into, the, mainstream, business, audience, in, the, later, in, the, middle, of, 1980s, though, often, treated, as, synonyms, in, french, globalization, is, seen, as, a, stage, following, mondialisation, a, stage, that, implies, the, dissolution, of, national, identities, and, the, abolishment, of, borders, inside, the, world, network, of, economic, exchanges, since, its, inception, the, concept, of, globalization, has, inspired, competing, definitions, and, interpretations, its, antecedents, date, back, to, the, great, movements, of, trade, and, empire, across, asia, and, the, indian, ocean, from, the, 15th, century, onward, in, 1848, karl, marx, noticed, the, increasing, level, of, national, inter, dependence, brought, on, by, capitalism, and, predicted, the, universal, character, of, the, modern, world, society, he, states, the, bourgeoisie, has, through, its, exploitation, of, the, world, market, given, a, cosmopolitan, character, to, production, and, consumption, in, every, country, to, the, great, chagrin, of, reactionists, it, has, drawn, from, under, the, feet, of, industry, the, national, ground, on, which, it, stood, all, old, established, national, industries, have, been, destroyed, or, are, daily, being, destroyed, in, place, of, the, old, local, and, national, seclusion, and, self, sufficiency, we, have, intercourse, in, every, direction, universal, inter, dependence, of, nations, sociologists, martin, albrow, and, elizabeth, king, define, globalization, as, all, those, processes, by, which, the, people, of, the, world, are, incorporated, into, a, single, world, society, in, the, consequences, of, modernity, anthony, giddens, writes, globalization, can, thus, be, defined, as, the, intensification, of, worldwide, social, relations, which, link, distant, localities, in, such, a, way, that, local, happenings, are, shaped, by, events, occurring, many, miles, away, and, vice, versa, in, 1992, roland, robertson, professor, of, sociology, at, the, university, of, aberdeen, and, an, early, writer, in, the, field, described, globalization, as, the, compression, of, the, world, and, the, intensification, of, the, consciousness, of, the, world, as, a, whole, in, global, transformations, david, held, and, his, co, writers, state, although, in, its, simplistic, sense, globalization, refers, to, the, widening, deepening, and, speeding, up, of, global, interconnection, such, a, definition, begs, further, elaboration, globalization, can, be, on, a, continuum, with, the, local, national, and, regional, at, one, end, of, the, continuum, lie, social, and, economic, relations, and, networks, which, are, organized, on, a, local, and, or, national, basis, at, the, other, end, lie, social, and, economic, relations, and, networks, which, crystallize, on, the, wider, scale, of, regional, and, global, interactions, globalization, can, refer, to, those, spatial, temporal, processes, of, change, which, underpin, a, transformation, in, the, organization, of, human, affairs, by, linking, together, and, expanding, human, activity, across, regions, and, continents, without, reference, to, such, expansive, spatial, connections, there, can, be, no, clear, or, coherent, formulation, of, this, term, a, satisfactory, definition, of, globalization, must, capture, each, of, these, elements, extensity, stretching, intensity, velocity, and, impact, held, and, his, co, writers, definition, of, globalization, in, that, same, book, as, transformation, in, the, spatial, organization, of, social, relations, and, transactions, assessed, in, terms, of, their, extensity, intensity, velocity, and, impact, generating, transcontinental, or, inter, regional, flows, was, called, probably, the, most, widely, cited, definition, in, the, 2014, dhl, global, connectiveness, index, swedish, journalist, thomas, larsson, in, his, book, the, race, to, the, top, the, real, story, of, globalization, states, that, globalization, is, the, process, of, world, shrinkage, of, distances, getting, shorter, things, moving, closer, it, pertains, to, the, increasing, ease, with, which, somebody, on, one, side, of, the, world, can, interact, to, mutual, benefit, with, somebody, on, the, other, side, of, the, world, paul, james, defines, globalization, with, a, more, direct, and, historically, contextualized, emphasis, globalization, is, the, extension, of, social, relations, across, world, space, defining, that, world, space, in, terms, of, the, historically, variable, ways, that, it, has, been, practiced, and, socially, understood, through, changing, world, time, manfred, steger, professor, of, global, studies, and, research, leader, in, the, global, cities, institute, at, rmit, university, identifies, four, main, empirical, dimensions, of, globalization, economic, political, cultural, and, ecological, a, fifth, dimension, the, ideological, cutting, across, the, other, four, the, ideological, dimension, according, to, steger, is, filled, with, a, range, of, norms, claims, beliefs, and, narratives, about, the, phenomenon, itself, james, and, steger, stated, that, the, concept, of, globalization, emerged, from, the, intersection, of, four, interrelated, sets, of, communities, of, practice, wenger, 1998, academics, journalists, publishers, editors, and, librarians, 424, they, note, the, term, was, used, in, education, to, describe, the, global, life, of, the, mind, in, international, relations, to, describe, the, extension, of, the, european, common, market, and, in, journalism, to, describe, how, the, american, negro, and, his, problem, are, taking, on, a, global, significance, they, have, also, argued, that, four, forms, of, globalization, can, be, distinguished, that, complement, and, cut, across, the, solely, empirical, dimensions, according, to, james, the, oldest, dominant, form, of, globalization, is, embodied, globalization, the, movement, of, people, a, second, form, is, agency, extended, globalization, the, circulation, of, agents, of, different, institutions, organizations, and, polities, including, imperial, agents, object, extended, globalization, a, third, form, is, the, movement, of, commodities, and, other, objects, of, exchange, he, calls, the, transmission, of, ideas, images, knowledge, and, information, across, world, space, disembodied, globalization, maintaining, that, it, is, currently, the, dominant, form, of, globalization, james, holds, that, this, series, of, distinctions, allows, for, an, understanding, of, how, today, the, most, embodied, forms, of, globalization, such, as, the, movement, of, refugees, and, migrants, are, increasingly, restricted, while, the, most, disembodied, forms, such, as, the, circulation, of, financial, instruments, and, codes, are, the, most, deregulated, the, journalist, thomas, l, friedman, popularized, the, term, flat, world, arguing, that, globalized, trade, outsourcing, supply, chaining, and, political, forces, had, permanently, changed, the, world, for, better, and, worse, he, asserted, that, the, pace, of, globalization, was, quickening, and, that, its, impact, on, business, organization, and, practice, would, continue, to, grow, economist, takis, fotopoulos, defined, economic, globalization, as, the, opening, and, deregulation, of, commodity, capital, and, labor, markets, that, led, toward, present, neoliberal, globalization, he, used, political, globalization, to, refer, to, the, emergence, of, a, transnational, lite, and, a, phasing, out, of, the, nation, state, meanwhile, he, used, cultural, globalization, to, reference, the, worldwide, homogenization, of, culture, other, of, his, usages, included, ideological, globalization, technological, globalization, and, social, globalization, lechner, and, boli, 2012, define, globalization, as, more, people, across, large, distances, becoming, connected, in, more, and, different, ways, globophobia, is, used, to, refer, to, the, fear, of, globalization, though, it, can, also, mean, the, fear, of, balloons, there, are, both, distal, and, proximate, causes, which, can, be, traced, in, the, historical, factors, affecting, globalization, large, scale, globalization, began, in, the, 19th, century, archaic, globalization, conventionally, refers, to, a, phase, in, the, history, of, globalization, including, globalizing, events, and, developments, from, the, time, of, the, earliest, civilizations, until, roughly, the, 1600s, this, term, is, used, to, describe, the, relationships, between, communities, and, states, and, how, they, were, created, by, the, geographical, spread, of, ideas, and, social, norms, at, both, local, and, regional, levels, in, this, schema, three, main, prerequisites, are, posited, for, globalization, to, occur, the, first, is, the, idea, of, eastern, origins, which, shows, how, western, states, have, adapted, and, implemented, learned, principles, from, the, east, without, the, spread, of, traditional, ideas, from, the, east, western, globalization, would, not, have, emerged, the, way, it, did, the, interactions, of, states, were, not, on, a, global, scale, and, most, often, were, confined, to, asia, north, africa, the, middle, east, and, certain, parts, of, europe, with, early, globalization, it, was, difficult, for, states, to, interact, with, others, that, were, not, close, eventually, technological, advances, allowed, states, to, learn, of, others, existence, and, thus, another, phase, of, globalization, can, occur, the, third, has, to, do, with, inter, dependency, stability, and, regularity, if, a, state, is, not, dependent, on, another, then, there, is, no, way, for, either, state, to, be, mutually, affected, by, the, other, this, is, one, of, the, driving, forces, behind, global, connections, and, trade, without, either, globalization, would, not, have, emerged, the, way, it, did, and, states, would, still, be, dependent, on, their, own, production, and, resources, to, work, this, is, one, of, the, arguments, surrounding, the, idea, of, early, globalization, it, is, argued, that, archaic, globalization, did, not, function, in, a, similar, manner, to, modern, globalization, because, states, were, not, as, interdependent, on, others, as, they, are, today, also, posited, is, a, multi, polar, nature, to, archaic, globalization, which, involved, the, active, participation, of, non, europeans, because, it, predated, the, great, divergence, in, the, nineteenth, century, where, western, europe, pulled, ahead, of, the, rest, of, the, world, in, terms, of, industrial, production, and, economic, output, archaic, globalization, was, a, phenomenon, that, was, driven, not, only, by, europe, but, also, by, other, economically, developed, old, world, centers, such, as, gujarat, bengal, coastal, china, and, japan, the, german, historical, economist, and, sociologist, andre, gunder, frank, argues, that, a, form, of, globalization, began, with, the, rise, of, trade, links, between, sumer, and, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, the, third, millennium, bce, this, archaic, globalization, existed, during, the, hellenistic, age, when, commercialized, urban, centers, enveloped, the, axis, of, greek, culture, that, reached, from, india, to, spain, including, alexandria, and, the, other, alexandrine, cities, early, on, the, geographic, position, of, greece, and, the, necessity, of, importing, wheat, forced, the, greeks, to, engage, in, maritime, trade, trade, in, ancient, greece, was, largely, unrestricted, the, state, controlled, only, the, supply, of, grain, trade, on, the, silk, road, was, a, significant, factor, in, the, development, of, civilizations, from, china, the, indian, subcontinent, persia, europe, and, arabia, opening, long, distance, political, and, economic, interactions, between, them, though, silk, was, certainly, the, major, trade, item, from, china, common, goods, such, as, salt, and, sugar, were, traded, as, well, and, religions, syncretic, philosophies, and, various, technologies, as, well, as, diseases, also, traveled, along, the, silk, routes, in, addition, to, economic, trade, the, silk, road, served, as, a, means, of, carrying, out, cultural, trade, among, the, civilizations, along, its, network, the, movement, of, people, such, as, refugees, artists, craftsmen, missionaries, robbers, and, envoys, resulted, in, the, exchange, of, religions, art, languages, and, new, technologies, early, modern, or, proto, globalization, covers, a, period, of, the, history, of, globalization, roughly, spanning, the, years, between, 1600, and, 1800, the, concept, of, proto, globalization, was, first, introduced, by, historians, a, g, hopkins, and, christopher, bayly, the, term, describes, the, phase, of, increasing, trade, links, and, cultural, exchange, that, characterized, the, period, immediately, preceding, the, advent, of, high, modern, globalization, in, the, late, 19th, century, this, phase, of, globalization, was, characterized, by, the, rise, of, maritime, european, empires, in, the, 15th, and, 17th, centuries, first, the, portuguese, empire, 1415, followed, by, the, spanish, empire, 1492, and, later, the, dutch, and, british, empires, in, the, 17th, century, world, trade, developed, further, when, chartered, companies, like, the, british, east, india, company, founded, in, 1600, and, the, dutch, east, india, company, founded, in, 1602, often, described, as, the, first, multinational, corporation, in, which, stock, was, offered, were, established, an, alternative, view, from, historians, dennis, flynn, and, arturo, giraldez, postulated, that, globalization, began, with, the, first, circumnavigation, of, the, globe, under, the, magellan, elcano, expedition, which, preluded, the, rise, of, global, silver, trade, early, modern, globalization, is, distinguished, from, modern, globalization, on, the, basis, of, expansionism, the, method, of, managing, global, trade, and, the, level, of, information, exchange, the, period, is, marked, by, the, shift, of, hegemony, to, western, europe, the, rise, of, larger, scale, conflicts, between, powerful, nations, such, as, the, thirty, years, war, and, demand, for, commodities, most, particularly, slaves, the, triangular, trade, made, it, possible, for, europe, to, take, advantage, of, resources, within, the, western, hemisphere, the, transfer, of, animal, stocks, plant, crops, and, epidemic, diseases, associated, with, alfred, w, crosby, s, concept, of, the, columbian, exchange, also, played, a, central, role, in, this, process, european, middle, eastern, indian, southeast, asian, and, chinese, merchants, were, all, involved, in, early, modern, trade, and, communications, particularly, in, the, indian, ocean, region, according, to, economic, historians, kevin, h, o, rourke, leandro, prados, de, la, escosura, and, guillaume, daudin, several, factors, promoted, globalization, in, the, period, 1815, 1870, during, the, 19th, century, globalization, approached, its, form, as, a, direct, result, of, the, industrial, revolution, industrialization, allowed, standardized, production, of, household, items, using, economies, of, scale, while, rapid, population, growth, created, sustained, demand, for, commodities, in, the, 19th, century, steamships, reduced, the, cost, of, international, transportation, significantly, and, railroads, made, inland, transportation, cheaper, the, transportation, revolution, occurred, some, time, between, 1820, and, 1850, more, nations, embraced, international, trade, globalization, in, this, period, was, decisively, shaped, by, nineteenth, century, imperialism, such, as, in, africa, and, asia, the, invention, of, shipping, containers, in, 1956, helped, advance, the, globalization, of, commerce, after, world, war, ii, work, by, politicians, led, to, the, agreements, of, the, bretton, woods, conference, in, which, major, governments, laid, down, the, framework, for, international, monetary, policy, commerce, and, finance, and, the, founding, of, several, international, institutions, intended, to, facilitate, economic, growth, by, lowering, trade, barriers, initially, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, gatt, led, to, a, series, of, agreements, to, remove, trade, restrictions, gatt, s, successor, was, the, world, trade, organization, wto, which, provided, a, framework, for, negotiating, and, formalizing, trade, agreements, and, a, dispute, resolution, process, exports, nearly, doubled, from, 8, 5, of, total, gross, world, product, in, 1970, to, 16, 2, in, 2001, the, approach, of, using, global, agreements, to, advance, trade, stumbled, with, the, failure, of, the, doha, development, round, of, trade, negotiation, many, countries, then, shifted, to, bilateral, or, smaller, multilateral, agreements, such, as, the, 2011, united, states, korea, free, trade, agreement, since, the, 1970s, aviation, has, become, increasingly, affordable, to, middle, classes, in, developed, countries, open, skies, policies, and, low, cost, carriers, have, helped, to, bring, competition, to, the, market, in, the, 1990s, the, growth, of, low, cost, communication, networks, cut, the, cost, of, communicating, between, countries, more, work, can, be, performed, using, a, computer, without, regard, to, location, this, included, accounting, software, development, and, engineering, design, student, exchange, programs, became, popular, after, world, war, ii, and, are, intended, to, increase, the, participants, understanding, and, tolerance, of, other, cultures, as, well, as, improving, their, language, skills, and, broadening, their, social, horizons, between, 1963, and, 2006, the, number, of, students, studying, in, a, foreign, country, increased, 9, times, since, the, 1980s, modern, globalization, has, spread, rapidly, through, the, expansion, of, capitalism, and, neoliberal, ideologies, the, implementation, of, neoliberal, policies, has, allowed, for, the, privatization, of, public, industry, deregulation, of, laws, or, policies, that, interfered, with, the, free, flow, of, the, market, as, well, as, cut, backs, to, governmental, social, services, these, neoliberal, policies, were, introduced, to, many, developing, countries, in, the, form, of, structural, adjustment, programs, saps, that, were, implemented, by, the, world, bank, and, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, these, programs, required, that, the, country, receiving, monetary, aid, would, open, its, markets, to, capitalism, privatize, public, industry, allow, free, trade, cut, social, services, like, healthcare, and, education, and, allow, the, free, movement, of, giant, multinational, corporations, these, programs, allowed, the, world, bank, and, the, imf, to, become, global, financial, market, regulators, that, would, promote, neoliberalism, and, the, creation, of, free, markets, for, multinational, corporations, on, a, global, scale, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, the, connectedness, of, the, world, s, economies, and, cultures, grew, very, quickly, this, slowed, down, from, the, 1910s, onward, due, to, the, world, wars, and, the, cold, war, but, picked, up, again, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, revolutions, of, 1989, and, subsequent, liberalization, in, many, parts, of, the, world, resulted, in, a, significant, expansion, of, global, interconnectedness, the, migration, and, movement, of, people, can, also, be, highlighted, as, a, prominent, feature, of, the, globalization, process, in, the, period, between, 1965, and, 1990, the, proportion, of, the, labor, force, migrating, approximately, doubled, most, migration, occurred, between, the, developing, countries, and, least, developed, countries, ldcs, as, economic, integration, intensified, workers, moved, to, areas, with, higher, wages, and, most, of, the, developing, world, oriented, toward, the, international, market, economy, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, not, only, ended, the, cold, war, s, division, of, the, world, it, also, left, the, united, states, its, sole, policeman, and, an, unfettered, advocate, of, free, market, it, also, resulted, in, the, growing, prominence, of, attention, focused, on, the, movement, of, diseases, the, proliferation, of, popular, culture, and, consumer, values, the, growing, prominence, of, international, institutions, like, the, un, and, concerted, international, action, on, such, issues, as, the, environment, and, human, rights, other, developments, as, dramatic, were, the, internet, s, becoming, influential, in, connecting, people, across, the, world, as, of, june, 2012, more, than, 2, 4, billion, people, over, a, third, of, the, world, s, human, population, have, used, the, services, of, the, internet, growth, of, globalization, has, never, been, smooth, one, influential, event, was, the, late, 2000s, recession, which, was, associated, with, lower, growth, in, areas, such, as, cross, border, phone, calls, and, skype, usage, or, even, temporarily, negative, growth, in, areas, such, as, trade, of, global, interconnectedness, the, china, united, states, trade, war, starting, in, 2018, negatively, affected, trade, between, the, two, largest, national, economies, the, economic, impact, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, included, a, massive, decline, in, tourism, and, international, business, travel, as, many, countries, temporarily, closed, borders, the, 2021, 2022, global, supply, chain, crisis, resulted, from, temporary, shutdowns, of, manufacturing, and, transportation, facilities, and, labor, shortages, supply, problems, incentivized, some, switches, to, domestic, production, the, economic, impact, of, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, included, a, blockade, of, ukrainian, ports, and, international, sanctions, on, russia, resulting, in, some, de, coupling, of, the, russian, economy, with, global, trade, especially, with, the, european, union, and, other, western, countries, modern, consensus, for, the, last, 15, years, regards, globalization, as, having, run, its, course, and, gone, into, decline, a, common, argument, for, this, is, that, trade, has, dropped, since, its, peak, in, 2008, and, never, recovered, since, the, great, recession, new, opposing, views, from, some, economists, have, argued, such, trends, are, a, result, of, price, drops, and, in, actuality, trade, volume, is, increasing, especially, with, agricultural, products, natural, resources, and, refined, petroleum, economic, globalization, is, the, increasing, economic, interdependence, of, national, economies, across, the, world, through, a, rapid, increase, in, cross, border, movement, of, goods, services, technology, and, capital, whereas, the, globalization, of, business, is, centered, around, the, diminution, of, international, trade, regulations, as, well, as, tariffs, taxes, and, other, impediments, that, suppresses, global, trade, economic, globalization, is, the, process, of, increasing, economic, integration, between, countries, leading, to, the, emergence, of, a, global, marketplace, or, a, single, world, market, depending, on, the, paradigm, economic, globalization, can, be, viewed, as, either, a, positive, or, a, negative, phenomenon, economic, globalization, comprises, globalization, of, production, which, refers, to, the, obtainment, of, goods, and, services, from, a, particular, source, from, locations, around, the, globe, to, benefit, from, difference, in, cost, and, quality, likewise, it, also, comprises, globalization, of, markets, which, is, defined, as, the, union, of, different, and, separate, markets, into, a, massive, global, marketplace, economic, globalization, also, includes, competition, technology, and, corporations, and, industries, current, globalization, trends, can, be, largely, accounted, for, by, developed, economies, integrating, with, less, developed, economies, by, means, of, foreign, direct, investment, the, reduction, of, trade, barriers, as, well, as, other, economic, reforms, and, in, many, cases, immigration, international, standards, have, made, trade, in, goods, and, services, more, efficient, an, example, of, such, standard, is, the, intermodal, container, containerization, dramatically, reduced, the, costs, of, transportation, supported, the, post, war, boom, in, international, trade, and, was, a, major, element, in, globalization, international, standards, are, set, by, the, international, organization, for, standardization, which, is, composed, of, representatives, from, various, national, standards, organizations, a, multinational, corporation, or, worldwide, enterprise, is, an, organization, that, owns, or, controls, the, production, of, goods, or, services, in, one, or, more, countries, other, than, their, home, country, it, can, also, be, referred, to, as, an, international, corporation, a, transnational, corporation, or, a, stateless, corporation, a, free, trade, area, is, the, region, encompassing, a, trade, bloc, whose, member, countries, have, signed, a, free, trade, agreement, fta, such, agreements, involve, cooperation, between, at, least, two, countries, to, reduce, trade, barriers, import, quotas, and, tariffs, and, to, increase, trade, of, goods, and, services, with, each, other, if, people, are, also, free, to, move, between, the, countries, in, addition, to, a, free, trade, agreement, it, would, also, be, considered, an, open, border, arguably, the, most, significant, free, trade, area, in, the, world, is, the, european, union, a, politico, economic, union, of, 27, member, states, that, are, primarily, located, in, europe, the, eu, has, developed, european, single, market, through, a, standardized, system, of, laws, that, apply, in, all, member, states, eu, policies, aim, to, ensure, the, free, movement, of, people, goods, services, and, capital, within, the, internal, market, trade, facilitation, looks, at, how, procedures, and, controls, governing, the, movement, of, goods, across, national, borders, can, be, improved, to, reduce, associated, cost, burdens, and, maximize, efficiency, while, safeguarding, legitimate, regulatory, objectives, global, trade, in, services, is, also, significant, for, example, in, india, business, process, outsourcing, has, been, described, as, the, primary, engine, of, the, country, s, development, over, the, next, few, decades, contributing, broadly, to, gdp, growth, employment, growth, and, poverty, alleviation, william, i, robinson, s, theoretical, approach, to, globalization, is, a, critique, of, wallerstein, s, world, systems, theory, he, believes, that, the, global, capital, experienced, today, is, due, to, a, new, and, distinct, form, of, globalization, which, began, in, the, 1980s, robinson, argues, not, only, are, economic, activities, expanded, across, national, boundaries, but, also, there, is, a, transnational, fragmentation, of, these, activities, one, important, aspect, of, robinson, s, globalization, theory, is, that, production, of, goods, are, increasingly, global, this, means, that, one, pair, of, shoes, can, be, produced, by, six, countries, each, contributing, to, a, part, of, the, production, process, cultural, globalization, refers, to, the, transmission, of, ideas, meanings, and, values, around, the, world, in, such, a, way, as, to, extend, and, intensify, social, relations, this, process, is, marked, by, the, common, consumption, of, cultures, that, have, been, diffused, by, the, internet, popular, culture, media, and, international, travel, this, has, added, to, processes, of, commodity, exchange, and, colonization, which, have, a, longer, history, of, carrying, cultural, meaning, around, the, globe, the, circulation, of, cultures, enables, individuals, to, partake, in, extended, social, relations, that, cross, national, and, regional, borders, the, creation, and, expansion, of, such, social, relations, is, not, merely, observed, on, a, material, level, cultural, globalization, involves, the, formation, of, shared, norms, and, knowledge, with, which, people, associate, their, individual, and, collective, cultural, identities, it, brings, increasing, interconnectedness, among, different, populations, and, cultures, cross, cultural, communication, is, a, field, of, study, that, looks, at, how, people, from, differing, cultural, backgrounds, communicate, in, similar, and, different, ways, among, themselves, and, how, they, endeavor, to, communicate, across, cultures, intercultural, communication, is, a, related, field, of, study, cultural, diffusion, is, the, spread, of, cultural, items, such, as, ideas, styles, religions, technologies, languages, etc, cultural, globalization, has, increased, cross, cultural, contacts, but, may, be, accompanied, by, a, decrease, in, the, uniqueness, of, once, isolated, communities, for, example, sushi, is, available, in, germany, as, well, as, japan, but, euro, disney, outdraws, the, city, of, paris, potentially, reducing, demand, for, authentic, french, pastry, globalization, s, contribution, to, the, alienation, of, individuals, from, their, traditions, may, be, modest, compared, to, the, impact, of, modernity, itself, as, alleged, by, existentialists, such, as, jean, paul, sartre, and, albert, camus, globalization, has, expanded, recreational, opportunities, by, spreading, pop, culture, particularly, via, the, internet, and, satellite, television, the, cultural, diffusion, can, create, a, homogenizing, force, where, globalization, is, seen, as, synonymous, with, homogenizing, force, via, connectedness, of, markets, cultures, politics, and, the, desire, for, modernizations, through, imperial, countries, sphere, of, influence, religions, were, among, the, earliest, cultural, elements, to, globalize, being, spread, by, force, migration, evangelists, imperialists, and, traders, christianity, islam, buddhism, and, more, recently, sects, such, as, mormonism, are, among, those, religions, which, have, taken, root, and, influenced, endemic, cultures, in, places, far, from, their, origins, globalization, has, strongly, influenced, sports, for, example, the, modern, olympic, games, has, athletes, from, more, than, 200, nations, participating, in, a, variety, of, competitions, the, fifa, world, cup, is, the, most, widely, viewed, and, followed, sporting, event, in, the, world, exceeding, even, the, olympic, games, a, ninth, of, the, entire, population, of, the, planet, watched, the, 2006, fifa, world, cup, final, the, term, globalization, implies, transformation, cultural, practices, including, traditional, music, can, be, lost, or, turned, into, a, fusion, of, traditions, globalization, can, trigger, a, state, of, emergency, for, the, preservation, of, musical, heritage, archivists, may, attempt, to, collect, record, or, transcribe, repertoires, before, melodies, are, assimilated, or, modified, while, local, musicians, may, struggle, for, authenticity, and, to, preserve, local, musical, traditions, globalization, can, lead, performers, to, discard, traditional, instruments, fusion, genres, can, become, interesting, fields, of, analysis, music, has, an, important, role, in, economic, and, cultural, development, during, globalization, music, genres, such, as, jazz, and, reggae, began, locally, and, later, became, international, phenomena, globalization, gave, support, to, the, world, music, phenomenon, by, allowing, music, from, developing, countries, to, reach, broader, audiences, though, the, term, world, music, was, originally, intended, for, ethnic, specific, music, globalization, is, now, expanding, its, scope, such, that, the, term, often, includes, hybrid, subgenres, such, as, world, fusion, global, fusion, ethnic, fusion, and, worldbeat, bourdieu, claimed, that, the, perception, of, consumption, can, be, seen, as, self, identification, and, the, formation, of, identity, musically, this, translates, into, each, individual, having, their, own, musical, identity, based, on, likes, and, tastes, these, likes, and, tastes, are, greatly, influenced, by, culture, as, this, is, the, most, basic, cause, for, a, person, s, wants, and, behavior, the, concept, of, one, s, own, culture, is, now, in, a, period, of, change, due, to, globalization, also, globalization, has, increased, the, interdependency, of, political, personal, cultural, and, economic, factors, a, 2005, unesco, report, showed, that, cultural, exchange, is, becoming, more, frequent, from, eastern, asia, but, that, western, countries, are, still, the, main, exporters, of, cultural, goods, in, 2002, china, was, the, third, largest, exporter, of, cultural, goods, after, the, uk, and, us, between, 1994, and, 2002, both, north, america, s, and, the, european, union, s, shares, of, cultural, exports, declined, while, asia, s, cultural, exports, grew, to, surpass, north, america, related, factors, are, the, fact, that, asia, s, population, and, area, are, several, times, that, of, north, america, americanization, is, related, to, a, period, of, high, political, american, clout, and, of, significant, growth, of, america, s, shops, markets, and, objects, being, brought, into, other, countries, some, critics, of, globalization, argue, that, it, harms, the, diversity, of, cultures, as, a, dominating, country, s, culture, is, introduced, into, a, receiving, country, through, globalization, it, can, become, a, threat, to, the, diversity, of, local, culture, some, argue, that, globalization, may, ultimately, lead, to, westernization, or, americanization, of, culture, where, the, dominating, cultural, concepts, of, economically, and, politically, powerful, western, countries, spread, and, cause, harm, to, local, cultures, globalization, is, a, diverse, phenomenon, that, relates, to, a, multilateral, political, world, and, to, the, increase, of, cultural, objects, and, markets, between, countries, the, indian, experience, particularly, reveals, the, plurality, of, the, impact, of, cultural, globalization, transculturalism, is, defined, as, seeing, oneself, in, the, other, transcultural, is, in, turn, described, as, extending, through, all, human, cultures, or, involving, encompassing, or, combining, elements, of, more, than, one, culture, children, brought, up, in, transcultural, backgrounds, are, sometimes, called, third, culture, kids, political, globalization, refers, to, the, growth, of, the, worldwide, political, system, both, in, size, and, complexity, that, system, includes, national, governments, their, governmental, and, intergovernmental, organizations, as, well, as, government, independent, elements, of, global, civil, society, such, as, international, non, governmental, organizations, and, social, movement, organizations, one, of, the, key, aspects, of, the, political, globalization, is, the, declining, importance, of, the, nation, state, and, the, rise, of, other, actors, on, the, political, scene, william, r, thompson, has, defined, it, as, the, expansion, of, a, global, political, system, and, its, institutions, in, which, inter, regional, transactions, including, but, certainly, not, limited, to, trade, are, managed, political, globalization, is, one, of, the, three, main, dimensions, of, globalization, commonly, found, in, academic, literature, with, the, two, other, being, economic, globalization, and, cultural, globalization, intergovernmentalism, is, a, term, in, political, science, with, two, meanings, the, first, refers, to, a, theory, of, regional, integration, originally, proposed, by, stanley, hoffmann, the, second, treats, states, and, the, national, government, as, the, primary, factors, for, integration, multi, level, governance, is, an, approach, in, political, science, and, public, administration, theory, that, originated, from, studies, on, european, integration, multi, level, governance, gives, expression, to, the, idea, that, there, are, many, interacting, authority, structures, at, work, in, the, emergent, global, political, economy, it, illuminates, the, intimate, entanglement, between, the, domestic, and, international, levels, of, authority, some, people, are, citizens, of, multiple, nation, states, multiple, citizenship, also, called, dual, citizenship, or, multiple, nationality, or, dual, nationality, is, a, person, s, citizenship, status, in, which, a, person, is, concurrently, regarded, as, a, citizen, of, more, than, one, state, under, the, laws, of, those, states, increasingly, non, governmental, organizations, influence, public, policy, across, national, boundaries, including, humanitarian, aid, and, developmental, efforts, philanthropic, organizations, with, global, missions, are, also, coming, to, the, forefront, of, humanitarian, efforts, charities, such, as, the, bill, and, melinda, gates, foundation, accion, international, the, acumen, fund, now, acumen, and, the, echoing, green, have, combined, the, business, model, with, philanthropy, giving, rise, to, business, organizations, such, as, the, global, philanthropy, group, and, new, associations, of, philanthropists, such, as, the, global, philanthropy, forum, the, bill, and, melinda, gates, foundation, projects, include, a, current, multibillion, dollar, commitment, to, funding, immunizations, in, some, of, the, world, s, more, impoverished, but, rapidly, growing, countries, the, hudson, institute, estimates, total, private, philanthropic, flows, to, developing, countries, at, us, 59, billion, in, 2010, as, a, response, to, globalization, some, countries, have, embraced, isolationist, policies, for, example, the, north, korean, government, makes, it, very, difficult, for, foreigners, to, enter, the, country, and, strictly, monitors, their, activities, when, they, do, aid, workers, are, subject, to, considerable, scrutiny, and, excluded, from, places, and, regions, the, government, does, not, wish, them, to, enter, citizens, cannot, freely, leave, the, country, globalization, has, been, a, gendered, process, where, giant, multinational, corporations, have, outsourced, jobs, to, low, wage, low, skilled, quota, free, economies, like, the, ready, made, garment, industry, in, bangladesh, where, poor, women, make, up, the, majority, of, labor, force, despite, a, large, proportion, of, women, workers, in, the, garment, industry, women, are, still, heavily, underemployed, compared, to, men, most, women, that, are, employed, in, the, garment, industry, come, from, the, countryside, of, bangladesh, triggering, migration, of, women, in, search, of, garment, work, it, is, still, unclear, as, to, whether, or, not, access, to, paid, work, for, women, where, it, did, not, exist, before, has, empowered, them, the, answers, varied, depending, on, whether, it, is, the, employers, perspective, or, the, workers, and, how, they, view, their, choices, women, workers, did, not, see, the, garment, industry, as, economically, sustainable, for, them, in, the, long, run, due, to, long, hours, standing, and, poor, working, conditions, although, women, workers, did, show, significant, autonomy, over, their, personal, lives, including, their, ability, to, negotiate, with, family, more, choice, in, marriage, and, being, valued, as, a, wage, earner, in, the, family, this, did, not, translate, into, workers, being, able, to, collectively, organize, themselves, in, order, to, negotiate, a, better, deal, for, themselves, at, work, another, example, of, outsourcing, in, manufacturing, includes, the, maquiladora, industry, in, ciudad, juarez, mexico, where, poor, women, make, up, the, majority, of, the, labor, force, women, in, the, maquiladora, industry, have, produced, high, levels, of, turnover, not, staying, long, enough, to, be, trained, compared, to, men, a, gendered, two, tiered, system, within, the, maquiladora, industry, has, been, created, that, focuses, on, training, and, worker, loyalty, women, are, seen, as, being, untrainable, placed, in, un, skilled, low, wage, jobs, while, men, are, seen, as, more, trainable, with, less, turnover, rates, and, placed, in, more, high, skilled, technical, jobs, the, idea, of, training, has, become, a, tool, used, against, women, to, blame, them, for, their, high, turnover, rates, which, also, benefit, the, industry, keeping, women, as, temporary, workers, scholars, also, occasionally, discuss, other, less, common, dimensions, of, globalization, such, as, environmental, globalization, the, internationally, coordinated, practices, and, regulations, often, in, the, form, of, international, treaties, regarding, environmental, protection, or, military, globalization, growth, in, global, extent, and, scope, of, security, relationships, those, dimensions, however, receive, much, less, attention, the, three, described, above, as, academic, literature, commonly, subdivides, globalization, into, three, major, areas, economic, globalization, cultural, globalization, and, political, globalization, an, essential, aspect, of, globalization, is, movement, of, people, and, state, boundary, limits, on, that, movement, have, changed, across, history, the, movement, of, tourists, and, business, people, opened, up, over, the, last, century, as, transportation, technology, improved, travel, time, and, costs, decreased, dramatically, between, the, 18th, and, early, 20th, century, for, example, travel, across, the, atlantic, ocean, used, to, take, up, to, 5, weeks, in, the, 18th, century, but, around, the, time, of, the, 20th, century, it, took, a, mere, 8, days, today, modern, aviation, has, made, long, distance, transportation, quick, and, affordable, tourism, is, travel, for, pleasure, the, developments, in, technology, and, transportation, infrastructure, such, as, jumbo, jets, low, cost, airlines, and, more, accessible, airports, have, made, many, types, of, tourism, more, affordable, at, any, given, moment, half, a, million, people, are, in, the, air, international, tourist, arrivals, surpassed, the, milestone, of, 1, billion, tourists, globally, for, the, first, time, in, 2012, a, visa, is, a, conditional, authorization, granted, by, a, country, to, a, foreigner, allowing, them, to, enter, and, temporarily, remain, within, or, to, leave, that, country, some, countries, such, as, those, in, the, schengen, area, have, agreements, with, other, countries, allowing, each, other, s, citizens, to, travel, between, them, without, visas, for, example, switzerland, is, part, of, a, schengen, agreement, allowing, easy, travel, for, people, from, countries, within, the, european, union, the, world, tourism, organization, announced, that, the, number, of, tourists, who, require, a, visa, before, traveling, was, at, its, lowest, level, ever, in, 2015, immigration, is, the, international, movement, of, people, into, a, destination, country, of, which, they, are, not, natives, or, where, they, do, not, possess, citizenship, in, order, to, settle, or, reside, there, especially, as, permanent, residents, or, naturalized, citizens, or, to, take, up, employment, as, a, migrant, worker, or, temporarily, as, a, foreign, worker, according, to, the, international, labour, organization, as, of, 2014, there, were, an, estimated, 232, million, international, migrants, in, the, world, defined, as, persons, outside, their, country, of, origin, for, 12, months, or, more, and, approximately, half, of, them, were, estimated, to, be, economically, active, i, e, being, employed, or, seeking, employment, international, movement, of, labor, is, often, seen, as, important, to, economic, development, for, example, freedom, of, movement, for, workers, in, the, european, union, means, that, people, can, move, freely, between, member, states, to, live, work, study, or, retire, in, another, country, globalization, is, associated, with, a, dramatic, rise, in, international, education, the, development, of, global, cross, cultural, competence, in, the, workforce, through, ad, hoc, training, has, deserved, increasing, attention, in, recent, times, more, and, more, students, are, seeking, higher, education, in, foreign, countries, and, many, international, students, now, consider, overseas, study, a, stepping, stone, to, permanent, residency, within, a, country, the, contributions, that, foreign, students, make, to, host, nation, economies, both, culturally, and, financially, has, encouraged, major, players, to, implement, further, initiatives, to, facilitate, the, arrival, and, integration, of, overseas, students, including, substantial, amendments, to, immigration, and, visa, policies, and, procedures, a, transnational, marriage, is, a, marriage, between, two, people, from, different, countries, a, variety, of, special, issues, arise, in, marriages, between, people, from, different, countries, including, those, related, to, citizenship, and, culture, which, add, complexity, and, challenges, to, these, kinds, of, relationships, in, an, age, of, increasing, globalization, where, a, growing, number, of, people, have, ties, to, networks, of, people, and, places, across, the, globe, rather, than, to, a, current, geographic, location, people, are, increasingly, marrying, across, national, boundaries, transnational, marriage, is, a, by, product, of, the, movement, and, migration, of, people, before, electronic, communications, long, distance, communications, relied, on, mail, speed, of, global, communications, was, limited, by, the, maximum, speed, of, courier, services, especially, horses, and, ships, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, electric, telegraph, was, the, first, method, of, instant, long, distance, communication, for, example, before, the, first, transatlantic, cable, communications, between, europe, and, the, americas, took, weeks, because, ships, had, to, carry, mail, across, the, ocean, the, first, transatlantic, cable, reduced, communication, time, considerably, allowing, a, message, and, a, response, in, the, same, day, lasting, transatlantic, telegraph, connections, were, achieved, in, the, 1865, 1866, the, first, wireless, telegraphy, transmitters, were, developed, in, 1895, the, internet, has, been, instrumental, in, connecting, people, across, geographical, boundaries, for, example, facebook, is, a, social, networking, service, which, has, more, than, 1, 65, billion, monthly, active, users, as, of, 31, march, 2016, globalization, can, be, spread, by, global, journalism, which, provides, massive, information, and, relies, on, the, internet, to, interact, makes, it, into, an, everyday, routine, to, investigate, how, people, and, their, actions, practices, problems, life, conditions, etc, in, different, parts, of, the, world, are, interrelated, possible, to, assume, that, global, threats, such, as, climate, change, precipitate, the, further, establishment, of, global, journalism, in, the, current, era, of, globalization, the, world, is, more, interdependent, than, at, any, other, time, efficient, and, inexpensive, transportation, has, left, few, places, inaccessible, and, increased, global, trade, has, brought, more, and, more, people, into, contact, with, animal, diseases, that, have, subsequently, jumped, species, barriers, see, zoonosis, coronavirus, disease, 2019, abbreviated, covid, 19, first, appeared, in, wuhan, china, in, november, 2019, more, than, 180, countries, have, reported, cases, since, then, as, of, april, 6, 2020, the, u, s, has, the, most, confirmed, active, cases, in, the, world, more, than, 3, 4, million, people, from, the, worst, affected, countries, entered, the, u, s, in, the, first, three, months, since, the, inception, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, this, has, caused, a, detrimental, impact, on, the, global, economy, particularly, for, sme, s, and, microbusinesses, with, unlimited, liability, self, employed, leaving, them, vulnerable, to, financial, difficulties, increasing, the, market, share, for, oligopolistic, markets, as, well, as, increasing, the, barriers, of, entry, one, index, of, globalization, is, the, kof, index, of, globalization, which, measures, three, important, dimensions, of, globalization, economic, social, and, political, another, is, the, a, t, kearney, foreign, policy, magazine, globalization, index, measurements, of, economic, globalization, typically, focus, on, variables, such, as, trade, foreign, direct, investment, fdi, gross, domestic, product, gdp, portfolio, investment, and, income, however, newer, indices, attempt, to, measure, globalization, in, more, general, terms, including, variables, related, to, political, social, cultural, and, even, environmental, aspects, of, globalization, the, dhl, global, connectedness, index, studies, four, main, types, of, cross, border, flow, trade, in, both, goods, and, services, information, people, including, tourists, students, and, migrants, and, capital, it, shows, that, the, depth, of, global, integration, fell, by, about, one, tenth, after, 2008, but, by, 2013, had, recovered, well, above, its, pre, crash, peak, the, report, also, found, a, shift, of, economic, activity, to, emerging, economies, reactions, to, processes, contributing, to, globalization, have, varied, widely, with, a, history, as, long, as, extraterritorial, contact, and, trade, philosophical, differences, regarding, the, costs, and, benefits, of, such, processes, give, rise, to, a, broad, range, of, ideologies, and, social, movements, proponents, of, economic, growth, expansion, and, development, in, general, view, globalizing, processes, as, desirable, or, necessary, to, the, well, being, of, human, society, antagonists, view, one, or, more, globalizing, processes, as, detrimental, to, social, well, being, on, a, global, or, local, scale, this, includes, those, who, focus, on, social, or, natural, sustainability, of, long, term, and, continuous, economic, expansion, the, social, structural, inequality, caused, by, these, processes, and, the, colonial, imperialistic, or, hegemonic, ethnocentrism, cultural, assimilation, and, cultural, appropriation, that, underlie, such, processes, globalization, tends, to, bring, people, into, contact, with, foreign, people, and, cultures, xenophobia, is, the, fear, of, that, which, is, perceived, to, be, foreign, or, strange, xenophobia, can, manifest, itself, in, many, ways, involving, the, relations, and, perceptions, of, an, ingroup, towards, an, outgroup, including, a, fear, of, losing, identity, suspicion, of, its, activities, aggression, and, desire, to, eliminate, its, presence, to, secure, a, presumed, purity, critiques, of, globalization, generally, stem, from, discussions, surrounding, the, impact, of, such, processes, on, the, planet, as, well, as, the, human, costs, they, challenge, directly, traditional, metrics, such, as, gdp, and, look, to, other, measures, such, as, the, gini, coefficient, or, the, happy, planet, index, and, point, to, a, multitude, of, interconnected, fatal, consequences, social, disintegration, a, breakdown, of, democracy, more, rapid, and, extensive, deterioration, of, the, environment, the, spread, of, new, diseases, increasing, poverty, and, alienation, which, they, claim, are, the, unintended, consequences, of, globalization, others, point, out, that, while, the, forces, of, globalization, have, led, to, the, spread, of, western, style, democracy, this, has, been, accompanied, by, an, increase, in, inter, ethnic, tension, and, violence, as, free, market, economic, policies, combine, with, democratic, processes, of, universal, suffrage, as, well, as, an, escalation, in, militarization, to, impose, democratic, principles, and, as, a, means, to, conflict, resolution, on, 9, august, 2019, pope, francis, denounced, isolationism, and, hinted, that, the, catholic, church, will, embrace, globalization, at, the, october, 2019, amazonia, synod, stating, the, whole, is, greater, than, the, parts, globalization, and, unity, should, not, be, conceived, as, a, sphere, but, as, a, polyhedron, each, people, retains, its, identity, in, unity, with, others, as, a, complex, and, multifaceted, phenomenon, globalization, is, considered, by, some, as, a, form, of, capitalist, expansion, which, entails, the, integration, of, local, and, national, economies, into, a, global, unregulated, market, economy, a, 2005, study, by, peer, fis, and, paul, hirsch, found, a, large, increase, in, articles, negative, towards, globalization, in, the, years, prior, in, 1998, negative, articles, outpaced, positive, articles, by, two, to, one, the, number, of, newspaper, articles, showing, negative, framing, rose, from, about, 10, of, the, total, in, 1991, to, 55, of, the, total, in, 1999, this, increase, occurred, during, a, period, when, the, total, number, of, articles, concerning, globalization, nearly, doubled, a, number, of, international, polls, have, shown, that, residents, of, africa, and, asia, tend, to, view, globalization, more, favorably, than, residents, of, europe, or, north, america, in, africa, a, gallup, poll, found, that, 70, of, the, population, views, globalization, favorably, the, bbc, found, that, 50, of, people, believed, that, economic, globalization, was, proceeding, too, rapidly, while, 35, believed, it, was, proceeding, too, slowly, in, 2004, philip, gordon, stated, that, a, clear, majority, of, europeans, believe, that, globalization, can, enrich, their, lives, while, believing, the, european, union, can, help, them, take, advantage, of, globalization, s, benefits, while, shielding, them, from, its, negative, effects, the, main, opposition, consisted, of, socialists, environmental, groups, and, nationalists, residents, of, the, eu, did, not, appear, to, feel, threatened, by, globalization, in, 2004, the, eu, job, market, was, more, stable, and, workers, were, less, likely, to, accept, wage, benefit, cuts, social, spending, was, much, higher, than, in, the, us, in, a, danish, poll, in, 2007, 76, responded, that, globalization, is, a, good, thing, fiss, et, al, surveyed, us, opinion, in, 1993, their, survey, showed, that, in, 1993, more, than, 40, of, respondents, were, unfamiliar, with, the, concept, of, globalization, when, the, survey, was, repeated, in, 1998, 89, of, the, respondents, had, a, polarized, view, of, globalization, as, being, either, good, or, bad, at, the, same, time, discourse, on, globalization, which, began, in, the, financial, community, before, shifting, to, a, heated, debate, between, proponents, and, disenchanted, students, and, workers, polarization, increased, dramatically, after, the, establishment, of, the, wto, in, 1995, this, event, and, subsequent, protests, led, to, a, large, scale, anti, globalization, movement, initially, college, educated, workers, were, likely, to, support, globalization, less, educated, workers, who, were, more, likely, to, compete, with, immigrants, and, workers, in, developing, countries, tended, to, be, opponents, the, situation, changed, after, the, great, recession, according, to, a, 1997, poll, 58, of, college, graduates, said, globalization, had, been, good, for, the, us, by, 2008, only, 33, thought, it, was, good, respondents, with, high, school, education, also, became, more, opposed, according, to, takenaka, heizo, and, chida, ryokichi, as, of, 1998, there, was, a, perception, in, japan, that, the, economy, was, small, and, frail, however, japan, was, resource, poor, and, used, exports, to, pay, for, its, raw, materials, anxiety, over, their, position, caused, terms, such, as, internationalization, and, globalization, to, enter, everyday, language, however, japanese, tradition, was, to, be, as, self, sufficient, as, possible, particularly, in, agriculture, many, in, developing, countries, see, globalization, as, a, positive, force, that, lifts, them, out, of, poverty, those, opposing, globalization, typically, combine, environmental, concerns, with, nationalism, opponents, consider, governments, as, agents, of, neo, colonialism, that, are, subservient, to, multinational, corporations, much, of, this, criticism, comes, from, the, middle, class, the, brookings, institution, suggested, this, was, because, the, middle, class, perceived, upwardly, mobile, low, income, groups, as, threatening, to, their, economic, security, the, literature, analyzing, the, economics, of, free, trade, is, extremely, rich, with, extensive, work, having, been, done, on, the, theoretical, and, empirical, effects, though, it, creates, winners, and, losers, the, broad, consensus, among, economists, is, that, free, trade, is, a, large, and, unambiguous, net, gain, for, society, in, a, 2006, survey, of, 83, american, economists, 87, 5, agree, that, the, u, s, should, eliminate, remaining, tariffs, and, other, barriers, to, trade, and, 90, 1, disagree, with, the, suggestion, that, the, u, s, should, restrict, employers, from, outsourcing, work, to, foreign, countries, quoting, harvard, economics, professor, n, gregory, mankiw, few, propositions, command, as, much, consensus, among, professional, economists, as, that, open, world, trade, increases, economic, growth, and, raises, living, standards, in, a, survey, of, leading, economists, none, disagreed, with, the, notion, that, freer, trade, improves, productive, efficiency, and, offers, consumers, better, choices, and, in, the, long, run, these, gains, are, much, larger, than, any, effects, on, employment, most, economists, would, agree, that, although, increasing, returns, to, scale, might, mean, that, certain, industry, could, settle, in, a, geographical, area, without, any, strong, economic, reason, derived, from, comparative, advantage, this, is, not, a, reason, to, argue, against, free, trade, because, the, absolute, level, of, output, enjoyed, by, both, winner, and, loser, will, increase, with, the, winner, gaining, more, than, the, loser, but, both, gaining, more, than, before, in, an, absolute, level, in, the, book, the, end, of, poverty, jeffrey, sachs, discusses, how, many, factors, can, affect, a, country, s, ability, to, enter, the, world, market, including, government, corruption, legal, and, social, disparities, based, on, gender, ethnicity, or, caste, diseases, such, as, aids, and, malaria, lack, of, infrastructure, including, transportation, communications, health, and, trade, unstable, political, landscapes, protectionism, and, geographic, barriers, jagdish, bhagwati, a, former, adviser, to, the, u, n, on, globalization, holds, that, although, there, are, obvious, problems, with, overly, rapid, development, globalization, is, a, very, positive, force, that, lifts, countries, out, of, poverty, by, causing, a, virtuous, economic, cycle, associated, with, faster, economic, growth, however, economic, growth, does, not, necessarily, mean, a, reduction, in, poverty, in, fact, the, two, can, coexist, economic, growth, is, conventionally, measured, using, indicators, such, as, gdp, and, gni, that, do, not, accurately, reflect, the, growing, disparities, in, wealth, additionally, oxfam, international, argues, that, poor, people, are, often, excluded, from, globalization, induced, opportunities, by, a, lack, of, productive, assets, weak, infrastructure, poor, education, and, ill, health, effectively, leaving, these, marginalized, groups, in, a, poverty, trap, economist, paul, krugman, is, another, staunch, supporter, of, globalization, and, free, trade, with, a, record, of, disagreeing, with, many, critics, of, globalization, he, argues, that, many, of, them, lack, a, basic, understanding, of, comparative, advantage, and, its, importance, in, today, s, world, the, flow, of, migrants, to, advanced, economies, has, been, claimed, to, provide, a, means, through, which, global, wages, converge, an, imf, study, noted, a, potential, for, skills, to, be, transferred, back, to, developing, countries, as, wages, in, those, a, countries, rise, lastly, the, dissemination, of, knowledge, has, been, an, integral, aspect, of, globalization, technological, innovations, or, technological, transfer, are, conjectured, to, benefit, most, developing, and, least, developing, countries, ldcs, as, for, example, in, the, adoption, of, mobile, phones, there, has, been, a, rapid, economic, growth, in, asia, after, embracing, market, orientation, based, economic, policies, that, encourage, private, property, rights, free, enterprise, and, competition, in, particular, in, east, asian, developing, countries, gdp, per, head, rose, at, 5, 9, a, year, from, 1975, to, 2001, according, to, 2003, human, development, report, of, undp, like, this, the, british, economic, journalist, martin, wolf, says, that, incomes, of, poor, developing, countries, with, more, than, half, the, world, s, population, grew, substantially, faster, than, those, of, the, world, s, richest, countries, that, remained, relatively, stable, in, its, growth, leading, to, reduced, international, inequality, and, the, incidence, of, poverty, certain, demographic, changes, in, the, developing, world, after, active, economic, liberalization, and, international, integration, resulted, in, rising, general, welfare, and, hence, reduced, inequality, according, to, wolf, in, the, developing, world, as, a, whole, life, expectancy, rose, by, four, months, each, year, after, 1970, and, infant, mortality, rate, declined, from, 107, per, thousand, in, 1970, to, 58, in, 2000, due, to, improvements, in, standards, of, living, and, health, conditions, also, adult, literacy, in, developing, countries, rose, from, 53, in, 1970, to, 74, in, 1998, and, much, lower, illiteracy, rate, among, the, young, guarantees, that, rates, will, continue, to, fall, as, time, passes, furthermore, the, reduction, in, fertility, rate, in, the, developing, world, as, a, whole, from, 4, 1, births, per, woman, in, 1980, to, 2, 8, in, 2000, indicates, improved, education, level, of, women, on, fertility, and, control, of, fewer, children, with, more, parental, attention, and, investment, consequently, more, prosperous, and, educated, parents, with, fewer, children, have, chosen, to, withdraw, their, children, from, the, labor, force, to, give, them, opportunities, to, be, educated, at, school, improving, the, issue, of, child, labor, thus, despite, seemingly, unequal, distribution, of, income, within, these, developing, countries, their, economic, growth, and, development, have, brought, about, improved, standards, of, living, and, welfare, for, the, population, as, a, whole, per, capita, gross, domestic, product, gdp, growth, among, post, 1980, globalizing, countries, accelerated, from, 1, 4, percent, a, year, in, the, 1960s, and, 2, 9, percent, a, year, in, the, 1970s, to, 3, 5, percent, in, the, 1980s, and, 5, 0, percent, in, the, 1990s, this, acceleration, in, growth, seems, even, more, remarkable, given, that, the, rich, countries, saw, steady, declines, in, growth, from, a, high, of, 4, 7, percent, in, the, 1960s, to, 2, 2, percent, in, the, 1990s, also, the, non, globalizing, developing, countries, seem, to, fare, worse, than, the, globalizers, with, the, former, s, annual, growth, rates, falling, from, highs, of, 3, 3, percent, during, the, 1970s, to, only, 1, 4, percent, during, the, 1990s, this, rapid, growth, among, the, globalizers, is, not, simply, due, to, the, strong, performances, of, china, and, india, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, 18, out, of, the, 24, globalizers, experienced, increases, in, growth, many, of, them, quite, substantial, the, globalization, of, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, has, led, to, the, resurfacing, of, the, idea, that, the, growth, of, economic, interdependence, promotes, peace, this, idea, had, been, very, powerful, during, the, globalization, of, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, and, was, a, central, doctrine, of, classical, liberals, of, that, era, such, as, the, young, john, maynard, keynes, 1883, 1946, some, opponents, of, globalization, see, the, phenomenon, as, a, promotion, of, corporate, interests, they, also, claim, that, the, increasing, autonomy, and, strength, of, corporate, entities, shapes, the, political, policy, of, countries, they, advocate, global, institutions, and, policies, that, they, believe, better, address, the, moral, claims, of, poor, and, working, classes, as, well, as, environmental, concerns, economic, arguments, by, fair, trade, theorists, claim, that, unrestricted, free, trade, benefits, those, with, more, financial, leverage, i, e, the, rich, at, the, expense, of, the, poor, globalization, allows, corporations, to, outsource, manufacturing, and, service, jobs, from, high, cost, locations, creating, economic, opportunities, with, the, most, competitive, wages, and, worker, benefits, critics, of, globalization, say, that, it, disadvantages, poorer, countries, while, it, is, true, that, free, trade, encourages, globalization, among, countries, some, countries, try, to, protect, their, domestic, suppliers, the, main, export, of, poorer, countries, is, usually, agricultural, productions, larger, countries, often, subsidize, their, farmers, e, g, the, eu, s, common, agricultural, policy, which, lowers, the, market, price, for, foreign, crops, democratic, globalization, is, a, movement, towards, an, institutional, system, of, global, democracy, that, would, give, world, citizens, a, say, in, political, organizations, this, would, in, their, view, bypass, nation, states, corporate, oligopolies, ideological, non, governmental, organizations, ngo, political, cults, and, mafias, one, of, its, most, prolific, proponents, is, the, british, political, thinker, david, held, advocates, of, democratic, globalization, argue, that, economic, expansion, and, development, should, be, the, first, phase, of, democratic, globalization, which, is, to, be, followed, by, a, phase, of, building, global, political, institutions, francesco, stipo, director, of, the, united, states, association, of, the, club, of, rome, advocates, unifying, nations, under, a, world, government, suggesting, that, it, should, reflect, the, political, and, economic, balances, of, world, nations, a, world, confederation, would, not, supersede, the, authority, of, the, state, governments, but, rather, complement, it, as, both, the, states, and, the, world, authority, would, have, power, within, their, sphere, of, competence, former, canadian, senator, douglas, roche, o, c, viewed, globalization, as, inevitable, and, advocated, creating, institutions, such, as, a, directly, elected, united, nations, parliamentary, assembly, to, exercise, oversight, over, unelected, international, bodies, global, civics, suggests, that, civics, can, be, understood, in, a, global, sense, as, a, social, contract, between, global, citizens, in, the, age, of, interdependence, and, interaction, the, disseminators, of, the, concept, define, it, as, the, notion, that, we, have, certain, rights, and, responsibilities, towards, each, other, by, the, mere, fact, of, being, human, on, earth, world, citizen, has, a, variety, of, similar, meanings, often, referring, to, a, person, who, disapproves, of, traditional, geopolitical, divisions, derived, from, national, citizenship, an, early, incarnation, of, this, sentiment, can, be, found, in, socrates, whom, plutarch, quoted, as, saying, i, am, not, an, athenian, or, a, greek, but, a, citizen, of, the, world, in, an, increasingly, interdependent, world, world, citizens, need, a, compass, to, frame, their, mindsets, and, create, a, shared, consciousness, and, sense, of, global, responsibility, in, world, issues, such, as, environmental, problems, and, nuclear, proliferation, baha, i, inspired, author, meyjes, while, favoring, the, single, world, community, and, emergent, global, consciousness, warns, of, globalization, as, a, cloak, for, an, expeditious, economic, social, and, cultural, anglo, dominance, that, is, insufficiently, inclusive, to, inform, the, emergence, of, an, optimal, world, civilization, he, proposes, a, process, of, universalization, as, an, alternative, cosmopolitanism, is, the, proposal, that, all, human, ethnic, groups, belong, to, a, single, community, based, on, a, shared, morality, a, person, who, adheres, to, the, idea, of, cosmopolitanism, in, any, of, its, forms, is, called, a, cosmopolitan, or, cosmopolite, a, cosmopolitan, community, might, be, based, on, an, inclusive, morality, a, shared, economic, relationship, or, a, political, structure, that, encompasses, different, nations, the, cosmopolitan, community, is, one, in, which, individuals, from, different, places, e, g, nation, states, form, relationships, based, on, mutual, respect, for, instance, kwame, anthony, appiah, suggests, the, possibility, of, a, cosmopolitan, community, in, which, individuals, from, varying, locations, physical, economic, etc, enter, relationships, of, mutual, respect, despite, their, differing, beliefs, religious, political, etc, canadian, philosopher, marshall, mcluhan, popularized, the, term, global, village, beginning, in, 1962, his, view, suggested, that, globalization, would, lead, to, a, world, where, people, from, all, countries, will, become, more, integrated, and, aware, of, common, interests, and, shared, humanity, military, cooperation, past, examples, of, international, cooperation, exist, one, example, is, the, security, cooperation, between, the, united, states, and, the, former, soviet, union, after, the, end, of, the, cold, war, which, astonished, international, society, arms, control, and, disarmament, agreements, including, the, strategic, arms, reduction, treaty, see, start, i, start, ii, start, iii, and, new, start, and,

constitute, concrete, initiatives, of, arms, control, and, de, nuclearization, the, us, russian, cooperation, was, further, strengthened, by, anti, terrorism, agreements, enacted, in, the, wake, of, 9, 11, environmental, cooperation, one, of, the, biggest, successes, of, environmental, cooperation, has, been, the, agreement, to, reduce, chlorofluorocarbon, cfc, emissions, as, specified, in, the, montreal, protocol, in, order, to, stop, ozone, depletion, the, most, recent, debate, around, nuclear, energy, and, the, non, alternative, coal, burning, power, plants, constitutes, one, more, consensus, on, what, not, to, do, thirdly, significant, achievements, in, ic, can, be, observed, through, development, studies, economic, cooperation, one, of, the, biggest, challenges, in, 2019, with, globalization, is, that, many, believe, the, progress, made, in, the, past, decades, are, now, back, tracking, the, back, tracking, of, globalization, has, coined, the, term, slobalization, slobalization, is, a, new, slower, pattern, of, globalization, anti, globalization, or, counter, globalization, consists, of, a, number, of, criticisms, of, globalization, but, in, general, is, critical, of, the, globalization, of, corporate, capitalism, the, movement, is, also, commonly, referred, to, as, the, alter, globalization, movement, anti, globalist, movement, anti, corporate, globalization, movement, or, movement, against, neoliberal, globalization, opponents, of, globalization, argue, that, power, and, respect, in, terms, of, international, trade, between, the, developed, and, underdeveloped, countries, of, the, world, are, unequally, distributed, the, diverse, subgroups, that, make, up, this, movement, include, some, of, the, following, trade, unionists, environmentalists, anarchists, land, rights, and, indigenous, rights, activists, organizations, promoting, human, rights, and, sustainable, development, opponents, of, privatization, and, anti, sweatshop, campaigners, in, the, revolt, of, the, elites, and, the, betrayal, of, democracy, christopher, lasch, analyzed, the, widening, gap, between, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, social, composition, in, the, united, states, for, him, our, epoch, is, determined, by, a, social, phenomenon, the, revolt, of, the, elites, in, reference, to, the, revolt, of, the, masses, 1929, by, the, spanish, philosopher, jos, ortega, y, gasset, according, to, lasch, the, new, elites, i, e, those, who, are, in, the, top, 20, in, terms, of, income, through, globalization, which, allows, total, mobility, of, capital, no, longer, live, in, the, same, world, as, their, fellow, citizens, in, this, they, oppose, the, old, bourgeoisie, of, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, which, was, constrained, by, its, spatial, stability, to, a, minimum, of, rooting, and, civic, obligations, globalization, according, to, the, sociologist, has, turned, elites, into, tourists, in, their, own, countries, the, denationalization, of, business, enterprise, tends, to, produce, a, class, who, see, themselves, as, world, citizens, but, without, accepting, any, of, the, obligations, that, citizenship, in, a, polity, normally, implies, their, ties, to, an, international, culture, of, work, leisure, information, make, many, of, them, deeply, indifferent, to, the, prospect, of, national, decline, instead, of, financing, public, services, and, the, public, treasury, new, elites, are, investing, their, money, in, improving, their, voluntary, ghettos, private, schools, in, their, residential, neighborhoods, private, police, garbage, collection, systems, they, have, withdrawn, from, common, life, composed, of, those, who, control, the, international, flows, of, capital, and, information, who, preside, over, philanthropic, foundations, and, institutions, of, higher, education, manage, the, instruments, of, cultural, production, and, thus, fix, the, terms, of, public, debate, so, the, political, debate, is, limited, mainly, to, the, dominant, classes, and, political, ideologies, lose, all, contact, with, the, concerns, of, the, ordinary, citizen, the, result, of, this, is, that, no, one, has, a, likely, solution, to, these, problems, and, that, there, are, furious, ideological, battles, on, related, issues, however, they, remain, protected, from, the, problems, affecting, the, working, classes, the, decline, of, industrial, activity, the, resulting, loss, of, employment, the, decline, of, the, middle, class, increasing, the, number, of, the, poor, the, rising, crime, rate, growing, drug, trafficking, the, urban, crisis, d, a, snow, et, al, contend, that, the, anti, globalization, movement, is, an, example, of, a, new, social, movement, which, uses, tactics, that, are, unique, and, use, different, resources, than, previously, used, before, in, other, social, movements, one, of, the, most, infamous, tactics, of, the, movement, is, the, battle, of, seattle, in, 1999, where, there, were, protests, against, the, world, trade, organization, s, third, ministerial, meeting, all, over, the, world, the, movement, has, held, protests, outside, meetings, of, institutions, such, as, the, wto, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, the, world, bank, the, world, economic, forum, and, the, group, of, eight, g8, within, the, seattle, demonstrations, the, protesters, that, participated, used, both, creative, and, violent, tactics, to, gain, the, attention, towards, the, issue, of, globalization, capital, markets, have, to, do, with, raising, and, investing, money, in, various, human, enterprises, increasing, integration, of, these, financial, markets, between, countries, leads, to, the, emergence, of, a, global, capital, marketplace, or, a, single, world, market, in, the, long, run, increased, movement, of, capital, between, countries, tends, to, favor, owners, of, capital, more, than, any, other, group, in, the, short, run, owners, and, workers, in, specific, sectors, in, capital, exporting, countries, bear, much, of, the, burden, of, adjusting, to, increased, movement, of, capital, those, opposed, to, capital, market, integration, on, the, basis, of, human, rights, issues, are, especially, disturbed, by, the, various, abuses, which, they, think, are, perpetuated, by, global, and, international, institutions, that, they, say, promote, neoliberalism, without, regard, to, ethical, standards, common, targets, include, the, world, bank, wb, international, monetary, fund, imf, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, and, the, world, trade, organization, wto, and, free, trade, treaties, like, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, nafta, free, trade,

poor, countries, movement, adherents, claim, free, trade, without, measures, in, place, to, protect, the, under, capitalized, will, contribute, only, to, the, strengthening, the, power, of, industrialized, nations, often, termed, the, north, in, opposition, to, the, developing, world, s, south, corporatist, ideology, which, privileges, the, rights, of, corporations, artificial, or, juridical, persons, over, those, of, natural, persons, is, an, underlying, factor, in, the, recent, rapid, expansion, of, global, commerce, in, recent, years, there, have, been, an, increasing, number, of, books, naomi, klein, s, 2000, no, logo, for, example, and, films, e, g, the, corporation, surplus, popularizing, an, anti, corporate, ideology, to, the, public, a, related, contemporary, ideology, consumerism, which, encourages, the, personal, acquisition, of, goods, and, services, also, drives, globalization, anti, consumerism, is, a, social, movement, against, equating, personal, happiness, with, consumption, and, the, purchase, of, material, possessions, concern, over, the, treatment, of, consumers, by, large, corporations, has, spawned, substantial, activism, and, the,

crime, environmental, degradation, and, general, social, malaise, and, discontent, one, variation, on, this, topic, is, activism, by, postconsumers, with, the, strategic, emphasis, on, moving, beyond, addictive, consumerism, the, global, justice, movement, is, the, loose, collection, of, individuals, and, groups, often, referred, to, as, a, movement, of, movements, who, advocate, fair, trade, rules, and, perceive, current, institutions, of, global, economic, integration, as, problems, the, movement, is, often, labeled, an, anti, globalization, movement, by, the, mainstream, media, those, involved, however, frequently, deny, that, they, are, anti, globalization, insisting, that, they, support, the, globalization, of, communication, and, people, and, oppose, only, the, global, expansion, of, corporate, power, the, movement, is, based, in, the, idea, of, social, justice, desiring, the, creation, of, a, society, or, institution, based, on, the, principles, of, equality, and, solidarity, the, values, of, human, rights, and, the, dignity, of, every, human, being, social, inequality, within, and, between, nations, including, a, growing, global, digital, divide, is, a, focal, point, of, the, movement, many, nongovernmental, organizations, have, now, arisen, to, fight, these, inequalities, that, many, in, latin, america, africa, and, asia, face, a, few, very, popular, and,

and, other, aid, efforts, the, economies, of, the, world, have, developed, unevenly, historically, such, that, entire, geographical, regions, were, left, mired, in, poverty, and, disease, while, others, began, to, reduce, poverty, and, disease, on, a, wholesale, basis, from, around, 1980, through, at, least, 2011, the, gdp, gap, while, still, wide, appeared, to, be, closing, and, in, some, more, rapidly, developing, countries, life, expectancies, began, to, rise, if, we, look, at, the, gini, coefficient, for, world, income, since, the, late, 1980s, the, gap, between, some, regions, has, markedly, narrowed, between, asia, and, the, advanced, economies, of, the, west, for, example, but, huge, gaps, remain, globally, overall, equality, across, humanity, considered, as, individuals, has, improved, very, little, within, the, decade, between, 2003, and, 2013, income, inequality, grew, even, in, traditionally, egalitarian, countries, like, germany, sweden, and, denmark, with, a, few, exceptions, france, japan, spain, the, top, 10, percent, of, earners, in, most, advanced, economies, raced, ahead, while, the, bottom, 10, percent, fell, further, behind, by, 2013, 85,

globalization, argue, that, globalization, results, in, weak, labor, unions, the, surplus, in, cheap, labor, coupled, with, an, ever, growing, number, of, companies, in, transition, weakened, labor, unions, in, high, cost, areas, unions, become, less, effective, and, workers, their, enthusiasm, for, unions, when, membership, begins, to, decline, they, also, cite, an, increase, in, the,

quarrying, salvage, and, farm, work, as, well, as, trafficking, bondage, forced, labor, prostitution, and, pornography, women, often, participate, in, the, workforce, in, precarious, work, including, export, oriented, employment, evidence, suggests, that, while, globalization, has, expanded, women, s, access, to, employment, the, long, term, goal, of, transforming, gender, inequalities, remains, unmet, and, appears, unattainable, without, regulation, of, capital, and, a, reorientation, and, expansion, of, the, state, s, role, in, funding, public, goods, and, providing, a, social, safety, net, furthermore, the, intersectionality, of, gender, race, class, can, be, overlooked, by, scholars, and, commentators, when, assessing, the, impact, of, globalization, in, 2016, a, study, published, by, the, imf, posited, that, neoliberalism, the, ideological, backbone, of, contemporary, globalized, capitalism, has, been, oversold, with, the, benefits, of, neoliberal, policies, being, fairly, difficult, to, establish, when, looking, at, a, broad, group, of, countries, and, the, costs, most, significantly, higher, income, inequality, within, nations, hurt, the, level, and, sustainability, of, growth, beginning, in, the, 1930s, opposition, arose, to, the, idea, of, a, world, government, as, advocated, by, organizations, such, as, the, world, federalist, movement, wfm, those, who, oppose, global, governance, typically, do, so, on, objections, that, the, idea, is, unfeasible, inevitably, oppressive, or, simply, unnecessary, in, general, these, opponents, are, wary, of, the, concentration, of, power, or, wealth, that, such, governance, might, represent, such, reasoning, dates, back, to, the, founding, of, the, league, of, nations, and, later, the, united, nations, environmentalism, is, a, broad, philosophy, ideology, and, social, movement, regarding, concerns, for, environmental, conservation, and, improvement, of, the, health, of, the, environment, environmentalist, concerns, with, globalization, include, issues, such, as, global, warming, global, water, supply, and, water, crises, inequity, in, energy, consumption, and, energy, conservation, transnational, air, pollution, and, pollution, of, the, world, ocean, overpopulation, world, habitat, sustainability, deforestation, biodiversity, loss, and, species, extinction, one, critique, of, globalization, is, that, natural, resources, of, the, poor, have, been, systematically, taken, over, by, the, rich, and, the, pollution, promulgated, by, the, rich, is, systematically, dumped, on, the, poor, some, argue, that, northern, corporations, are, increasingly, exploiting, resources, of, less, wealthy, countries, for, their, global, activities, while, it, is, the, south, that, is, disproportionately, bearing, the, environmental, burden, of, the, globalized, economy, globalization, is, thus, leading, to, a, type, of, environmental, apartheid, helena, norberg, hodge, the, director, and, founder, of, local, futures, international, society, for, ecology, and, culture, criticizes, globalization, in, many, ways, in, her, book, ancient, futures, norberg, hodge, claims, that, centuries, of, ecological, balance, and, social, harmony, are, under, threat, from, the, pressures, of, development, and, globalization, she, also, criticizes, the, standardization, and, rationalization, of, globalization, as, it, does, not, always, yield, the, expected, growth, outcomes, although, globalization, takes, similar, steps, in, most, countries, scholars, such, as, hodge, claim, that, it, might, not, be, effective, to, certain, countries, and, that, globalization, has, actually, moved, some, countries, backward, instead, of, developing, them, a, related, area, of, concern, is, the, pollution, haven, hypothesis, which, posits, that, when, large, industrialized, nations, seek, to, set, up, factories, or, offices, abroad, they, will, often, look, for, the, cheapest, option, in, terms, of, resources, and, labor, that, offers, the, land, and, material, access, they, require, see, race, to, the, bottom, this, often, comes, at, the, cost, of, environmentally, sound, practices, developing, countries, with, cheap, resources, and, labor, tend, to, have, less, stringent, environmental, regulations, and, conversely, nations, with, stricter, environmental, regulations, become, more, expensive, for, companies, as, a, result, of, the, costs, associated, with, meeting, these, standards, thus, companies, that, choose, to, physically, invest, in, foreign, countries, tend, to, re, locate, to, the, countries, with, the, lowest, environmental, standards, or, weakest, enforcement, the, european, union, mercosur, free, trade, agreement, which, would, form, one, of, the, world, s, largest, free, trade, areas, has, been, denounced, by, environmental, activists, and, indigenous, rights, campaigners, the, fear, is, that, the, deal, could, lead, to, more, deforestation, of, the, amazon, rainforest, as, it, expands, market, access, to, brazilian, beef
