used, language, on, websites, the, german, speaking, countries, are, ranked, fifth, in, terms, of, annual, publication, of, new, books, with, one, tenth, of, all, books, including, e, books, in, the, world, being, published, in, german, german, is, most, closely, related, to, other, west, germanic, languages, namely, afrikaans, dutch, english, the, frisian, languages, and, scots, it, also, contains, close, similarities, in, vocabulary, to, some, languages, in, the, north, germanic, group, such, as, danish, norwegian, and, swedish, modern, german, gradually, developed, from, old, high, german, which, in, turn, developed, from, proto, germanic, during, the, early, middle, ages, german, is, an, inflected, language, with, four, cases, for, nouns, pronouns, and, adjectives, nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, three, genders, masculine, feminine, neuter, and, two, numbers, singular, plural, it, has, strong, and, weak, verbs, the, majority, of, its, vocabulary, derives, from, the, ancient, germanic, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, while, a, smaller, share, is, partly, derived, from, latin, and, greek, along, with, fewer, words, borrowed, from, french, and, modern, english, english, however, is, the, main, source, of, more, recent, loan, words, german, is, a, pluricentric, language, the, three, standardized, variants, are, german, austrian, and, swiss, standard, german, standard, german, is, sometimes, called, high, german, which, refers, to, its, regional, origin, german, is, also, notable, for, its, broad, spectrum, of, dialects, with, many, varieties, existing, in, europe, and, other, parts, of, the, world, some, of, these, non, standard, varieties, have, become, recognized, and, protected, by, regional, or, national, governments, since, 2004, heads, of, state, of, the, german, speaking, countries, have, met, every, year, and, the, council, for, german, orthography, has, been, the, main, international, body, regulating, german, orthography, german, is, an, indo, european, language, that, belongs, to, the, west, germanic, group, of, the, germanic, languages, the, germanic, languages, are, traditionally, subdivided, into, three, branches, north, germanic, east, germanic, and, west, germanic, the, first, of, these, branches, survives, in, modern, danish, swedish, norwegian, faroese, and, icelandic, all, of, which, are, descended, from, old, norse, the, east, germanic, languages, are, now, extinct, and, gothic, is, the, only, language, in, this, branch, which, survives, in, written, texts, the, west, germanic, languages, however, have, undergone, extensive, dialectal, subdivision, and, are, now, represented, in, modern, languages, such, as, english, german, dutch, yiddish, afrikaans, and, others, within, the, west, germanic, language, dialect, continuum, the, benrath, and, uerdingen, lines, running, through, d, sseldorf, benrath, and, krefeld, uerdingen, respectively, serve, to, distinguish, the, germanic, dialects, that, were, affected, by, the, high, german, consonant, shift, south, of, benrath, from, those, that, were, not, north, of, uerdingen, the, various, regional, dialects, spoken, south, of, these, lines, are, grouped, as, high, german, dialects, while, those, spoken, to, the, north, comprise, the, low, german, and, low, franconian, dialects, as, members, of, the, west, germanic, language, family, high, german, low, german, and, low, franconian, have, been, proposed, to, be, further, distinguished, historically, as, irminonic, ingvaeonic, and, istvaeonic, respectively, this, classification, indicates, their, historical, descent, from, dialects, spoken, by, the, irminones, also, known, as, the, elbe, group, ingvaeones, or, north, sea, germanic, group, and, istvaeones, or, weser, rhine, group, standard, german, is, based, on, a, combination, of, thuringian, upper, saxon, and, upper, franconian, dialects, which, are, central, german, and, upper, german, dialects, belonging, to, the, high, german, dialect, group, german, is, therefore, closely, related, to, the, other, languages, based, on, high, german, dialects, such, as, luxembourgish, based, on, central, franconian, dialects, and, yiddish, also, closely, related, to, standard, german, are, the, upper, german, dialects, spoken, in, the, southern, german, speaking, countries, such, as, swiss, german, alemannic, dialects, and, the, various, germanic, dialects, spoken, in, the, french, region, of, grand, est, such, as, alsatian, mainly, alemannic, but, also, central, and, upper, franconian, dialects, and, lorraine, franconian, central, franconian, after, these, high, german, dialects, standard, german, is, less, closely, related, to, languages, based, on, low, franconian, dialects, e, g, dutch, and, afrikaans, low, german, or, low, saxon, dialects, spoken, in, northern, germany, and, southern, denmark, neither, of, which, underwent, the, high, german, consonant, shift, as, has, been, noted, the, former, of, these, dialect, types, is, istvaeonic, and, the, latter, ingvaeonic, whereas, the, high, german, dialects, are, all, irminonic, the, differences, between, these, languages, and, standard, german, are, therefore, considerable, also, related, to, german, are, the, frisian, languages, north, frisian, spoken, in, nordfriesland, saterland, frisian, spoken, in, saterland, and, west, frisian, spoken, in, friesland, as, well, as, the, anglic, languages, of, english, and, scots, these, anglo, frisian, dialects, did, not, take, part, in, the, high, german, consonant, shift, and, the, anglic, languages, also, adopted, much, vocabulary, from, both, old, norse, and, the, norman, language, the, history, of, the, german, language, begins, with, the, high, german, consonant, shift, during, the, migration, period, which, separated, old, high, german, dialects, from, old, saxon, this, sound, shift, involved, a, drastic, change, in, the, pronunciation, of, both, voiced, and, voiceless, stop, consonants, b, d, g, and, p, t, k, respectively, the, primary, effects, of, the, shift, were, the, following, below, while, there, is, written, evidence, of, the, old, high, german, language, in, several, elder, futhark, inscriptions, from, as, early, as, the, sixth, century, ad, such, as, the, pforzen, buckle, the, old, high, german, period, is, generally, seen, as, beginning, with, the, abrogans, written, c, 765, 775, a, latin, german, glossary, supplying, over, 3, 000, old, high, german, words, with, their, latin, equivalents, after, the, abrogans, the, first, coherent, works, written, in, old, high, german, appear, in, the, ninth, century, chief, among, them, being, the, muspilli, merseburg, charms, and, hildebrandslied, and, other, religious, texts, the, georgslied, ludwigslied, evangelienbuch, and, translated, hymns, and, prayers, the, muspilli, is, a, christian, poem, written, in, a, bavarian, dialect, offering, an, account, of, the, soul, after, the, last, judgment, and, the, merseburg, charms, are, transcriptions, of, spells, and, charms, from, the, pagan, germanic, tradition, of, particular, interest, to, scholars, however, has, been, the, hildebrandslied, a, secular, epic, poem, telling, the, tale, of, an, estranged, father, and, son, unknowingly, meeting, each, other, in, battle, linguistically, this, text, is, highly, interesting, due, to, the, mixed, use, of, old, saxon, and, old, high, german, dialects, in, its, composition, the, written, works, of, this, period, stem, mainly, from, the, alamanni, bavarian, and, thuringian, groups, all, belonging, to, the, elbe, germanic, group, irminones, which, had, settled, in, what, is, now, southern, central, germany, and, austria, between, the, second, and, sixth, centuries, during, the, great, migration, in, general, the, surviving, texts, of, old, high, german, ohg, show, a, wide, range, of, dialectal, diversity, with, very, little, written, uniformity, the, early, written, tradition, of, ohg, survived, mostly, through, monasteries, and, scriptoria, as, local, translations, of, latin, originals, as, a, result, the, surviving, texts, are, written, in, highly, disparate, regional, dialects, and, exhibit, significant, latin, influence, particularly, in, vocabulary, at, this, point, monasteries, where, most, written, works, were, produced, were, dominated, by, latin, and, german, saw, only, occasional, use, in, official, and, ecclesiastical, writing, while, there, is, no, complete, agreement, over, the, dates, of, the, middle, high, german, mhg, period, it, is, generally, seen, as, lasting, from, 1050, to, 1350, this, was, a, period, of, significant, expansion, of, the, geographical, territory, occupied, by, germanic, tribes, and, consequently, of, the, number, of, german, speakers, whereas, during, the, old, high, german, period, the, germanic, tribes, extended, only, as, far, east, as, the, elbe, and, saale, rivers, the, mhg, period, saw, a, number, of, these, tribes, expanding, beyond, this, eastern, boundary, into, slavic, territory, known, as, the, ostsiedlung, with, the, increasing, wealth, and, geographic, spread, of, the, germanic, groups, came, greater, use, of, german, in, the, courts, of, nobles, as, the, standard, language, of, official, proceedings, and, literature, a, clear, example, of, this, is, the, mittelhochdeutsche, dichtersprache, employed, in, the, hohenstaufen, court, in, swabia, as, a, standardized, supra, dialectal, written, language, while, these, efforts, were, still, regionally, bound, german, began, to, be, used, in, place, of, latin, for, certain, official, purposes, leading, to, a, greater, need, for, regularity, in, written, conventions, while, the, major, changes, of, the, mhg, period, were, socio, cultural, high, german, was, still, undergoing, significant, linguistic, changes, in, syntax, phonetics, and, morphology, as, well, e, g, diphthongization, of, certain, vowel, sounds, hus, ohg, mhg, house, haus, regionally, in, later, mhg, haus, nhg, and, weakening, of, unstressed, short, vowels, to, schwa, taga, ohg, days, tage, mhg, a, great, wealth, of, texts, survives, from, the, mhg, period, significantly, these, texts, include, a, number, of, impressive, secular, works, such, as, the, nibelungenlied, an, epic, poem, telling, the, story, of, the, dragon, slayer, siegfried, c, thirteenth, century, and, the, iwein, an, arthurian, verse, poem, by, hartmann, von, aue, c, 1203, lyric, poems, and, courtly, romances, such, as, parzival, and, tristan, also, noteworthy, is, the, sachsenspiegel, the, first, book, of, laws, written, in, middle, low, german, c, 1220, the, abundance, and, especially, the, secular, character, of, the, literature, of, the, mhg, period, demonstrate, the, beginnings, of, a, standardized, written, form, of, german, as, well, as, the, desire, of, poets, and, authors, to, be, understood, by, individuals, on, supra, dialectal, terms, the, middle, high, german, period, is, generally, seen, as, ending, when, the, 1346, 53, black, death, decimated, europe, s, population, modern, high, german, begins, with, the, early, new, high, german, enhg, period, which, wilhelm, scherer, dates, 1350, 1650, terminating, with, the, end, of, the, thirty, years, war, this, period, saw, the, further, displacement, of, latin, by, german, as, the, primary, language, of, courtly, proceedings, and, increasingly, of, literature, in, the, german, states, while, these, states, were, still, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, far, from, any, form, of, unification, the, desire, for, a, cohesive, written, language, that, would, be, understandable, across, the, many, german, speaking, principalities, and, kingdoms, was, stronger, than, ever, as, a, spoken, language, german, remained, highly, fractured, throughout, this, period, with, a, vast, number, of, often, mutually, incomprehensible, regional, dialects, being, spoken, throughout, the, german, states, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, c, 1440, and, the, publication, of, luther, s, vernacular, translation, of, the, bible, in, 1534, however, had, an, immense, effect, on, standardizing, german, as, a, supra, dialectal, written, language, the, enhg, period, saw, the, rise, of, several, important, cross, regional, forms, of, chancery, german, one, being, gemeine, tiutsch, used, in, the, court, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, maximilian, i, and, the, other, being, mei, ner, deutsch, used, in, the, electorate, of, saxony, in, the, duchy, of, saxe, wittenberg, alongside, these, courtly, written, standards, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, led, to, the, development, of, a, number, of, printers, languages, druckersprachen, aimed, at, making, printed, material, readable, and, understandable, across, as, many, diverse, dialects, of, german, as, possible, the, greater, ease, of, production, and, increased, availability, of, written, texts, brought, about, increased, standardisation, in, the, written, form, of, german, one, of, the, central, events, in, the, development, of, enhg, was, the, publication, of, luther, s, translation, of, the, bible, into, high, german, the, new, testament, was, published, in, 1522, the, old, testament, was, published, in, parts, and, completed, in, 1534, luther, based, his, translation, primarily, on, the, mei, ner, deutsch, of, saxony, spending, much, time, among, the, population, of, saxony, researching, the, dialect, so, as, to, make, the, work, as, natural, and, accessible, to, german, speakers, as, possible, copies, of, luther, s, bible, featured, a, long, list, of, glosses, for, each, region, translating, words, which, were, unknown, in, the, region, into, the, regional, dialect, luther, said, the, following, concerning, his, translation, method, one, who, would, talk, german, does, not, ask, the, latin, how, he, shall, do, it, he, must, ask, the, mother, in, the, home, the, children, on, the, streets, the, common, man, in, the, market, place, and, note, carefully, how, they, talk, then, translate, accordingly, they, will, then, understand, what, is, said, to, them, because, it, is, german, when, christ, says, ex, abundantia, cordis, os, loquitur, i, would, translate, if, i, followed, the, papists, aus, dem, berflusz, des, herzens, redet, der, mund, but, tell, me, is, this, talking, german, what, german, understands, such, stuff, no, the, mother, in, the, home, and, the, plain, man, would, say, wesz, das, herz, voll, ist, des, gehet, der, mund, ber, luther, s, translation, of, the, bible, into, high, german, was, also, decisive, for, the, german, language, and, its, evolution, from, early, new, high, german, to, modern, standard, german, the, publication, of, luther, s, bible, was, a, decisive, moment, in, the, spread, of, literacy, in, early, modern, germany, and, promoted, the, development, of, non, local, forms, of, language, and, exposed, all, speakers, to, forms, of, german, from, outside, their, own, area, with, luther, s, rendering, of, the, bible, in, the, vernacular, german, asserted, itself, against, the, dominance, of, latin, as, a, legitimate, language, for, courtly, literary, and, now, ecclesiastical, subject, matter, his, bible, was, ubiquitous, in, the, german, states, nearly, every, household, possessed, a, copy, nevertheless, even, with, the, influence, of, luther, s, bible, as, an, unofficial, written, standard, a, widely, accepted, standard, for, written, german, did, not, appear, until, the, middle, of, the, eighteenth, century, german, was, the, language, of, commerce, and, government, in, the, habsburg, empire, which, encompassed, a, large, area, of, central, and, eastern, europe, until, the, mid, nineteenth, century, it, was, essentially, the, language, of, townspeople, throughout, most, of, the, empire, its, use, indicated, that, the, speaker, was, a, merchant, or, someone, from, an, urban, area, regardless, of, nationality, prague, german, prag, and, budapest, buda, german, ofen, to, name, two, examples, were, gradually, germanized, in, the, years, after, their, incorporation, into, the, habsburg, domain, others, like, pressburg, pozsony, now, bratislava, were, originally, settled, during, the, habsburg, period, and, were, primarily, german, at, that, time, prague, budapest, bratislava, and, cities, like, zagreb, german, agram, or, ljubljana, german, laibach, contained, significant, german, minorities, in, the, eastern, provinces, of, banat, bukovina, and, transylvania, german, banat, buchenland, siebenb, rgen, german, was, the, predominant, language, not, only, in, the, larger, towns, like, temeschburg, timi, oara, hermannstadt, sibiu, and, kronstadt, bra, ov, but, also, in, many, smaller, localities, in, the, surrounding, areas, in, 1901, the, second, orthographic, conference, ended, with, a, nearly, complete, standardization, of, the, standard, german, language, in, its, written, form, and, the, duden, handbook, was, declared, its, standard, definition, punctuation, and, compound, spelling, joined, or, isolated, compounds, were, not, standardized, in, the, process, the, deutsche, b, hnensprache, lit, german, stage, language, by, theodor, siebs, had, established, conventions, for, german, pronunciation, in, theatres, three, years, earlier, however, this, was, an, artificial, standard, that, did, not, correspond, to, any, traditional, spoken, dialect, rather, it, was, based, on, the, pronunciation, of, german, in, northern, germany, although, it, was, subsequently, regarded, often, as, a, general, prescriptive, norm, despite, differing, pronunciation, traditions, especially, in, the, upper, german, speaking, regions, that, still, characterise, the, dialect, of, the, area, today, especially, the, pronunciation, of, the, ending, ig, as, instead, of, in, northern, germany, high, german, was, a, foreign, language, to, most, inhabitants, whose, native, dialects, were, subsets, of, low, german, it, was, usually, encountered, only, in, writing, or, formal, speech, in, fact, most, of, high, german, was, a, written, language, not, identical, to, any, spoken, dialect, throughout, the, german, speaking, area, until, well, into, the, 19th, century, however, wider, standardization, of, pronunciation, was, established, on, the, basis, of, public, speaking, in, theatres, and, the, media, during, the, 20th, century, and, documented, in, pronouncing, dictionaries, official, revisions, of, some, of, the, rules, from, 1901, were, not, issued, until, the, controversial, german, orthography, reform, of, 1996, was, made, the, official, standard, by, governments, of, all, german, speaking, countries, media, and, written, works, are, now, almost, all, produced, in, standard, german, which, is, understood, in, all, areas, where, german, is, spoken, approximate, distribution, of, native, german, speakers, assuming, a, rounded, total, of, 95, million, worldwide, as, a, result, of, the, german, diaspora, as, well, as, the, popularity, of, german, taught, as, a, foreign, language, the, geographical, distribution, of, german, speakers, or, germanophones, spans, all, inhabited, continents, however, an, exact, global, number, of, native, german, speakers, is, complicated, by, the, existence, of, several, varieties, whose, status, as, separate, languages, or, dialects, is, disputed, for, political, and, linguistic, reasons, including, quantitatively, strong, varieties, like, certain, forms, of, alemannic, and, low, german, with, the, inclusion, or, exclusion, of, certain, varieties, it, is, estimated, that, approximately, 90, 95, million, people, speak, german, as, a, first, language, 10, 25, million, speak, it, as, a, second, language, and, 75, 100, million, as, a, foreign, language, this, would, imply, the, existence, of, approximately, 175, 220, million, german, speakers, worldwide, german, sociolinguist, ulrich, ammon, estimated, a, number, of, 289, million, german, foreign, language, speakers, without, clarifying, the, criteria, by, which, he, classified, a, speaker, as, of, 2012, about, 90, million, people, or, 16, of, the, european, union, s, population, spoke, german, as, their, mother, tongue, making, it, the, second, most, widely, spoken, language, on, the, continent, after, russian, and, the, second, biggest, language, in, terms, of, overall, speakers, after, english, as, well, as, the, most, spoken, native, language, the, area, in, central, europe, where, the, majority, of, the, population, speaks, german, as, a, first, language, and, has, german, as, a, co, official, language, is, called, the, german, sprachraum, german, is,

wars, greatly, diminished, them, minority, communities, of, mostly, bilingual, german, native, speakers, exist, in, areas, both, adjacent, to, and, detached, from, the, sprachraum, within, europe, german, is, a, recognized, minority, language, in, the, following, countries, in, france, the, high, german, varieties, of, alsatian, and, moselle, franconian, are, identified, as, regional, languages, but, the, european, charter, for, regional, or, minority, languages, of, 1998, has, not, yet, been, ratified, by, the, government, namibia, also, was, a, colony, of, the, german, empire, from, 1884, to, 1915, about, 30, 000, people, still, speak, german, as, a, native, tongue, today, mostly, descendants, of, german, colonial, settlers, the, period, of, german, colonialism, in, namibia, also, led, to, the, evolution, of, a, standard, german, based, pidgin, language, called, namibian, black, german, which, became, a, second, language, for, parts, of, the, indigenous, population, although, it, is, nearly, extinct, today, some, older, namibians, still, have, some, knowledge, of, it, german, remained, a, de, facto, official, language, of, namibia, after, the, end, of, german, colonial, rule, alongside, english, and, afrikaans, and, had, de, jure, co, official, status, from, 1984, until, its, independence, from, south, africa, in, 1990, however, the, namibian, government, perceived, afrikaans, and, german, as, symbols, of, apartheid, and, colonialism, and, decided, english, would, be, the, sole, official, language, upon, independence, stating, that, it, was, a, neutral, language, as, there, were, virtually, no, english, native, speakers, in, namibia, at, that, time, german, afrikaans, and, several, indigenous, languages, thus, became, national, languages, by, law, identifying, them, as, elements, of, the, cultural, heritage, of, the, nation, and, ensuring, that, the, state, acknowledged, and, supported, their, presence, in, the, country,

language, spoken, at, home, after, english, as, a, legacy, of, significant, german, immigration, to, the, country, german, geographical, names, can, be, found, throughout, the, midwest, region, such, as, new, ulm, and, bismarck, north, dakota, s, state, capital, plus, many, other, regions, a, number, of, german, varieties, have, developed, in, the, country, and, are, still, spoken, today, such, as, pennsylvania, dutch, and, texas, german, in, brazil, the, largest, concentrations, of, german, speakers, are, in, the, states, of, rio, grande, do, sul, where, riograndenser, hunsr, ckisch, developed, santa, catarina, and, esp, rito, santo, german, dialects, namely, hunsrik, and, east, pomeranian, are, recognized, languages, in, the, following, municipalities, in, brazil, in, chile, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, there, was, a, massive, immigration, of, germans, swiss, and, austrians, because, of, that, two, dialects, of, german, emerged, lagunen, deutsch, and, chiloten, deutsch, immigrants, even, founded, prosperous, cities, and, towns, the, impact, of, nineteenth, century, german, immigration, to, southern, chile, was, such, that, valdivia, was, for, a, while, a, spanish, german, bilingual, city, with, german, signboards, and, placards, alongside, the, spanish, currently, german, and, its, dialects, are, spoken, in, many, cities, towns, and, rural, areas, of, southern, chile, such, as, valdivia, osorno, puerto, montt, puerto, varas, frutillar, nueva, braunau, castro, ancud, among, many, others, small, concentrations, of, german, speakers, and, their, descendants, are, also, found, in, argentina, chile, paraguay, venezuela, and, bolivia, in, australia, the, state, of, south, australia, experienced, a, pronounced, wave, of, prussian, immigration, in, the, 1840s, particularly, from, silesia, region, with, the, prolonged, isolation, from, other, german, speakers, and, contact, with, australian, english, a, unique, dialect, known, as, barossa, german, developed, spoken, predominantly, in, the, barossa, valley, near, adelaide, usage, of, german, sharply, declined, with, the, advent, of, world, war, i, due, to, the, prevailing, anti, german, sentiment, in, the, population, and, related, government, action, it, continued, to, be, used, as, a, first, language, into, the, 20th, century, but, its, use, is, now, limited, to, a, few, older, speakers, as, of, the, 2013, census, 36, 642, people, in, new, zealand, spoke, german, mostly, descendants, of, a, small, wave, of, 19th, century, german, immigrants, making, it, the, third, most, spoken, european, language, after, english, and, french, and, overall, the, ninth, most, spoken, language, a, german, creole, named, unserdeutsch, was, historically, spoken, in, the, former, german, colony, of, german, new, guinea, modern, day, papua, new, guinea, it, is, at, a, high, risk, of, extinction, with, only, about, 100, speakers, remaining, and, a, topic, of, interest, among, linguists, seeking, to, revive, interest, in, the, language, like, english, french, and, spanish, german, has, become, a, standard, foreign, language, throughout, the, world, especially, in, the, western, world, german, ranks, second, on, par, with, french, among, the, best, known, foreign, languages, in, the, european, union, eu, after, english, as, well, as, in, russia, and, turkey, in, terms, of, student, numbers, across, all, levels, of, education, german, ranks, third, in, the, eu, after, english, and, french, and, in, the, united, states, after, spanish, and, french, in, british, schools, where, learning, a, foreign, language, is, not, mandatory, a, dramatic, decline, in, entries, for, german, a, level, has, been, observed, in, 2020, approximately, 15, 4, million, people, were, enrolled, in, learning, german, across, all, levels, of, education, worldwide, this, number, has, decreased, from, a, peak, of, 20, 1, million, in, 2000, within, the, eu, not, counting, countries, where, it, is, an, official, language, german, as, a, foreign, language, is, most, popular, in, eastern, and, northern, europe, namely, the, czech, republic, croatia, denmark, the, netherlands, slovakia, hungary, slovenia, sweden, poland, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, german, was, once, and, to, some, extent, still, is, a, lingua, franca, in, those, parts, of, europe, a, visible, sign, of, the, geographical, extension, of, the, german, language, is, the, german, language, media, outside, the, german, speaking, countries, german, is, the, second, most, commonly, used, scientific, language, as, well, as, the, third, most, widely, used, language, on, websites, after, english, and, russian, deutsche, welle, german, pronunciation, german, wave, in, german, or, dw, is,

standard, german, developed, with, the, luther, bible, and, the, chancery, language, spoken, by, the, saxon, court, part, of, the, regional, high, german, group, however, there, are, places, where, the, traditional, regional, dialects, have, been, replaced, by, new, vernaculars, based, on, standard, german, that, is, the, case, in, large, stretches, of, northern, germany, but, also, in, major, cities, in, other, parts, of, the, country, it, is, important, to, note, however, that, the, colloquial, standard, german, differs, from, the, formal, written, language, especially, in, grammar, and, syntax, in, which, it, has, been, influenced, by, dialectal, speech, standard, german, differs, regionally, among, german, speaking, countries, in, vocabulary, and, some, instances, of, pronunciation, and, even, grammar, and, orthography, this, variation, must, not, be, confused, with, the, variation, of, local, dialects, even, though, the, national, varieties, of, standard, german, are, only, somewhat, influenced, by, the, local, dialects, they, are, very, distinct, german, is, thus, considered, a, pluricentric, language, with, currently, three, national, standard, varieties, of, german, standard, german, german, standard, austrian, german, and, standard, swiss, german, in, comparison, to, other, european, languages, e, g, portuguese, english, the, multi, standard, character, of, german, is, still, not, widely, acknowledged, however, 90, of, austrian, secondary, school, teachers, of, german, consider, german, as, having, more, than, one, standard, variety, in, this, context, some, scholars, speak, of, a, one, standard, german, axiom, that, has, been, maintained, as, a, core, assumption, of, german, dialectology, in, most, regions, the, speakers, use, a, continuum, e, g, umgangssprache, colloquial, standards, from, more, dialectal, varieties, to, more, standard, varieties, depending, on, the, circumstances, in, german, linguistics, german, dialects, are, distinguished, from, varieties, of, standard, german, the, varieties, of, standard, german, refer, to, the, different, local, varieties, of, the, pluricentric, german, they, differ, mainly, in, lexicon, and, phonology, but, also, smaller, grammatical, differences, in, certain, regions, they, have, replaced, the, traditional, german, dialects, especially, in, northern, germany, in, the, german, speaking, parts, of, switzerland, mixtures, of, dialect, and, standard, are, very, seldom, used, and, the, use, of, standard, german, is, largely, restricted, to, the, written, language, about, 11, of, the, swiss, residents, speak, standard, german, at, home, but, this, is, mainly, due, to, german, immigrants, this, situation, has, been, called, a, medial, diglossia, swiss, standard, german, is, used, in, the, swiss, education, system, while, austrian, german, is, officially, used, in, the, austrian, education, system, the, german, dialects, are, the, traditional, local, varieties, of, the, language, many, of, them, are, not, mutually, intelligible, with, standard, german, and, they, have, great, differences, in, lexicon, phonology, and, syntax, if, a, narrow, definition, of, language, based, on, mutual, intelligibility, is, used, many, german, dialects, are, considered, to, be, separate, languages, for, instance, by, iso, 639, 3, however, such, a, point, of, view, is, unusual, in, german, linguistics, the, german, dialect, continuum, is, traditionally, divided, most, broadly, into, high, german, and, low, german, also, called, low, saxon, however, historically, high, german, dialects, and, low, saxon, low, german, dialects, do, not, belong, to, the, same, language, nevertheless, in, today, s, germany, low, saxon, low, german, is, often, perceived, as, a, dialectal, variation, of, standard, german, on, a, functional, level, even, by, many, native, speakers, the, variation, among, the, german, dialects, is, considerable, with, often, only, neighbouring, dialects, being, mutually, intelligible, some, dialects, are, not, intelligible, to, people, who, know, only, standard, german, however, all, german, dialects, belong, to, the, dialect, continuum, of, high, german, and, low, saxon, middle, low, german, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, hanseatic, league, it, was, the, predominant, language, in, northern, germany, until, the, 16th, century, in, 1534, the, luther, bible, was, published, it, aimed, to, be, understandable, to, a, broad, audience, and, was, based, mainly, on, central, and, upper, german, varieties, the, early, new, high, german, language, gained, more, prestige, than, low, german, and, became, the, language, of, science, and, literature, around, the, same, time, the, hanseatic, league, a, confederation, of, northern, ports, lost, its, importance, as, new, trade, routes, to, asia, and, the, americas, were, established, and, the, most, powerful, german, states, of, that, period, were, located, in, middle, and, southern, germany, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, were, marked, by, mass, education, in, standard, german, in, schools, gradually, low, german, came, to, be, politically, viewed, as, a, mere, dialect, spoken, by, the, uneducated, the, proportion, of, the, population, who, can, understand, and, speak, it, has, decreased, continuously, since, world, war, ii, the, low, franconian, dialects, fall, within, a, linguistic, category, used, to, classify, a, number, of, historical, and, contemporary, west, germanic, varieties, most, closely, related, to, and, including, the, dutch, language, consequently, the, vast, majority, of, the, low, franconian, dialects, are, spoken, outside, of, the, german, language, area, low, franconian, dialects, are, spoken, in, the, netherlands, belgium, south, africa, suriname, and, namibia, and, along, the, lower, rhine, in, germany, in, north, rhine, westphalia, the, region, in, germany, encompasses, parts, of, the, rhine,

itself, a, low, franconian, language, in, south, africa, it, is, afrikaans, which, is, also, categorized, as, low, franconian, during, the, middle, ages, and, early, modern, period, the, low, franconian, dialects, now, spoken, in, germany, used, middle, dutch, or, early, modern, dutch, as, their, literary, language, and, dachsprache, following, a, 19th, century, change, in, prussian, language, policy, use, of, dutch, as, an, official, and, public, language, was, forbidden, resulting, in, standard, german, taking, its, place, as, the, region, s, official, language, as, a, result, these, dialects, are, now, considered, german, dialects, from, a, socio, linguistic, point, of, view, the, low, franconian, dialects, in, germany, are, divided, by, the, uerdingen, line, north, of, which, i, is, pronounced, as, ik, and, south, of, which, as, ich, into, northern, and, southern, low, franconian, the, northern, variants, comprise, kleverlandish, which, is, most, similar, to,

by, case, gender, and, number, this, degree, of, inflection, is, considerably, less, than, in, old, high, german, and, other, old, indo, european, languages, such, as, latin, ancient, greek, and,

the, second, hundeh, tte, dog, hut, specifically, dog, kennel, unlike, english, whose, newer, compounds, or, combinations, of, longer, nouns, are, often, written, open, with, separating, spaces, german, like, some, other, germanic, languages, nearly, always, uses, the, closed, form, without, spaces, for, example, baumhaus, tree, house, like, english, german, allows, arbitrarily, long, compounds, in, theory, see, also, english, compounds, the, longest, german, word, verified, to, be, actually, in, albeit, very, limited, use, is, rindfleischetikettierungs, berwachungsaufgaben, bertragungsgesetz, which, literally, translated, is, beef, labelling, supervision, duties, assignment, law, however, examples, like, this, are, perceived, by, native, speakers, as, excessively, bureaucratic, stylistically, awkward, or, even, satirical, on, the, other, hand, even, this, compound, could, be, expanded, by, any, native, speaker, the, inflection, of, standard, german, verbs, includes, the, meaning, of, basic, verbs, can, be, expanded, and, sometimes, radically, changed, through, the, use, of, a, number, of, prefixes, some, prefixes, have, a, specific, meaning, the, prefix, zer, refers, to, destruction, as, in, zer, rei, en, to, tear, apart, zer, brechen, to, break, apart, zer, schneiden, to, cut, apart, other, prefixes, have, only, the, vaguest, meaning, in, themselves, ver, is, found, in, a, number, of, verbs, with, a, large, variety, of, meanings, as, in, ver, suchen, to, try, from, suchen, to, seek, ver, nehmen, to, interrogate, from, nehmen, to, take, ver, teilen, to, distribute, from, teilen, to, share, ver, stehen, to, understand, from, stehen, to, stand, other, examples, include, the, following, haften, to, stick, ver, haften, to, detain, kaufen, to, buy, ver, kaufen, to, sell, h, ren, to, hear, auf, h, ren, to, cease, fahren, to, drive, er, fahren, to, experience, many, german, verbs, have, a, separable, prefix, often, with, an, adverbial, function, in, finite, verb, forms, it, is, split, off, and, moved, to, the, end, of, the, clause, and, is, hence, considered, by, some, to, be, a, resultative, particle, for, example, mitgehen, meaning, to, go, along, would, be, split, giving, gehen, sie, mit, literal, go, you, with, idiomatic, are, you, going, along, indeed, several, parenthetical, clauses, may, occur, between, the, prefix, of, a, finite, verb, and, its, complement, ankommen, to, arrive, er, kam, an, he, arrived, er, ist, angekommen, he, has, arrived, a, selectively, literal, translation, of, this, example, to, illustrate, the, point, might, look, like, this, german, word, order, is, generally, with, the, v2, word, order, restriction, and, also, with, the, sov, word, order, restriction, for, main, clauses, for, yes, no, questions, exclamations, and, wishes, the, finite, verb, always, has, the, first, position, in, subordinate, clauses, all, verb, forms, occur, at, the, very, end, german, requires, a, verbal, element, main, verb, modal, verb, or, auxiliary, verb, as, finite, verb, to, appear, second, in, the, sentence, the, verb, is, preceded, by, the, topic, of, the, sentence, the, element, in, focus, appears, at, the, end, of, the, sentence, for, a, sentence, without, an, auxiliary, these, are, several, possibilities, the, position, of, a, noun, in, a, german, sentence, has, no, bearing, on, its, being, a, subject, an, object, or, another, argument, in, a, declarative, sentence, in, english, if, the, subject, does, not, occur, before, the, predicate, the, sentence, could, well, be, misunderstood, however, german, s, flexible, word, order, allows, one, to, emphasise, specific, words, normal, word, order, second, variant, in, normal, word, order, object, in, front, adverb, of, time, in, front, both, time, expressions, in, front, another, possibility, swapped, adverbs, swapped, object, the, flexible, word, order, also, allows, one, to, use, language, tools, such, as, poetic, meter, and, figures, of, speech, more, freely, when, an, auxiliary, verb, is, present, it, appears, in, second, position, and, the, main, verb, appears, at, the, end, this, occurs, notably, in, the, creation, of, the, perfect, tense, many, word, orders, are, still, possible, the, main, verb, may, appear, in, first, position, to, put, stress, on, the, action, itself, the, auxiliary, verb, is, still, in, second, position, sentences, using, modal, verbs, as, finite, verbs, place, the, infinitive, at, the, end, for, example, the, english, sentence, should, he, go, home, would, be, rearranged, in, german, to, say, should, he, to, home, go, soll, er, nach, hause, gehen, thus, in, sentences, with, several, subordinate, or, relative, clauses, the, infinitives, are, clustered, at, the, end, compare, the, similar, clustering, of, prepositions, in, the, following, highly, contrived, english, sentence, what, did, you, bring, that, book, that, i, do, not, like, to, be, read, to, out, of, up, for, german, subordinate, clauses, have, all, verbs, clustered, at, the, end, with, the, finite, verb, normally, in, the, final, position, of, the, cluster, given, that, auxiliaries, encode, future, passive, modality, and, the, perfect, very, long, chains, of, verbs, at, the, end, of, the, sentence, can, occur, in, these, constructions, the, past, participle, formed, with, ge, is, often, replaced, by, the, infinitive, the, order, at, the, end, of, such, strings, is, subject, to, variation, but, the, second, one, in, the, last, example, is, unusual, most, german, vocabulary, is, derived, from, the, germanic, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, however, there, is, a, significant, amount, of, loanwords, from, other, languages, in, particular, latin, greek, italian, french, and, most, recently, english, in, the, early, 19th, century, joachim, heinrich, campe, estimated, that, one, fifth, of, the, total, german, vocabulary, was, of, french, or, latin, origin, latin, words, were, already, imported, into, the, predecessor, of, the, german, language, during, the, roman, empire, and, underwent, all, the, characteristic, phonetic, changes, in, german, their, origin, is, thus, no, longer, recognizable, for, most, speakers, e, g, pforte, tafel, mauer, k, se, k, ln, from, latin, porta, tabula, murus, caseus, colonia, borrowing, from, latin, continued, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, during, christianisation, mediated, by, the, church, and, monasteries, another, important, influx, of, latin, words, can, be, observed, during, renaissance, humanism, in, a, scholarly, context, the, borrowings, from, latin, have, continued, until, today, in, the, last, few, decades, often, indirectly, through, borrowings, from, english, during, the, 15th, to, 17th, centuries, the, influence, of, italian, was, great, leading, to, many, italian, loanwords, in, the, fields, of, architecture, finance, and, music, the, influence, of, the, french, language, in, the, 17th, to, 19th, centuries, resulted, in, an, even, greater, import, of, french, words, the, english, influence, was, already, present, in, the, 19th, century, but, it, did, not, become, dominant, until, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, thus, notker, labeo, translated, the, aristotelian, treatises, into, pure, old, high, german, in, the, decades, after, the, year, 1000, the, tradition, of, loan, translation, revitalized, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, with, poets, like, philipp, von, zesen, or, linguists, like, joachim, heinrich, campe, who, introduced, close, to, 300, words, which, are, still, used, in, modern, german, even, today, there, are, movements, that, promote, the, substitution, of, foreign, words, that, are, deemed, unnecessary, with, german, alternatives, as, in, english, there, are, many, pairs, of, synonyms, due, to, the, enrichment, of, the, germanic, vocabulary, with, loanwords, from, latin, and, latinized, greek, these, words, often, have, different, connotations, from, their, germanic, counterparts, and, are, usually, perceived, as, more, scholarly, the, size, of, the, vocabulary, of, german, is, difficult, to, estimate, the, deutsches, w, rterbuch, german, dictionary, initiated, by, the, brothers, grimm, jacob, and, wilhelm, grimm, and, the, most, comprehensive, guide, to, the, vocabulary, of, the, german, language, already, contained, over, 330, 000, headwords, in, its, first, edition, the, modern, german, scientific, vocabulary, is, estimated, at, nine, million, words, and, word, groups, based, on, the, analysis, of, 35, million, sentences, of, a, corpus, in, leipzig, which, as, of, july, 2003, included, 500, million, words, in, total, written, texts, in, german, are, easily, recognisable, as, such, by, distinguishing, features, such, as, umlauts, and, certain, orthographical, features, such, as, the, capitalization, of, all, nouns, and, the, frequent, occurrence, of, long, compounds, because, legibility, and, convenience, set, certain, boundaries, compounds, consisting, of, more, than, three, or, four, nouns, are, almost, exclusively, found, in, humorous, contexts, english, also, can, string, nouns, together, though, it, usually, separates, the, nouns, with, spaces, as, for, example, toilet, bowl, cleaner, in, german, orthography, nouns, are, capitalized, which, makes, it, easier, for, readers, to, determine, the, function, of, a, word, within, a, sentence, this, convention, is, almost, unique, to, german, today, shared, perhaps, only, by, the, closely, related, luxembourgish, language, and, several, insular, dialects, of, the, north, frisian, language, but, it, was, historically, common, in, northern, europe, in, the, early, modern, era, including, in, languages, such, as, danish, which, abolished, the, capitalization, of, nouns, in, 1948, and, english, for, a, while, into, the, 1700s, before, the, german, orthography, reform, of, 1996, replaced, ss, after, long, vowels, and, diphthongs, and, before, consonants, word, or, partial, word, endings, in, reformed, spelling, replaces, ss, only, after, long, vowels, and, diphthongs, since, there, is, no, traditional, capital, form, of, it, was, replaced, by, ss, or, sz, when, capitalization, was, required, for, example, ma, band, tape, measure, became, massband, in, capitals, an, exception, was, the, use, of, in, legal, documents, and, forms, when, capitalizing, names, to, avoid, confusion, with, similar, names, lower, case, was, sometimes, maintained, thus, kre, lein, instead, of, kresslein, capital, was, ultimately, adopted, into, german, orthography, in, 2017, ending, a, long, orthographic, debate, thus, kre, lein, and, kresslein, umlaut, vowels, are, commonly, transcribed, with, ae, oe, and, ue, if, the, umlauts, are, not, available, on, the, keyboard, or, other, medium, used, in, the, same, manner, can, be, transcribed, as, ss, some, operating, systems, use, key, sequences, to, extend, the, set, of, possible, characters, to, include, amongst, other, things, umlauts, in, microsoft, windows, this, is, done, using, alt, codes, german, readers, understand, these, transcriptions, although, they, appear, unusual, but, they, are, avoided, if, the, regular, umlauts, are, available, because, they, are, a, makeshift, and, not, proper, spelling, in, westphalia, and, schleswig, holstein, city, and, family, names, exist, where, the, extra, e, has, a, vowel, lengthening, effect, e, g, raesfeld, coesfeld, and, itzehoe, but, this, use, of, the, letter, e, after, a, o, u, does, not, occur, in, the, present, day, spelling, of, words, other, than, proper, nouns, there, is, no, general, agreement, on, where, letters, with, umlauts, occur, in, the, sorting, sequence, telephone, directories, treat, them, by, replacing, them, with, the, base, vowel, followed, by, an, e, some, dictionaries, sort, each, umlauted, vowel, as, a, separate, letter, after, the, base, vowel, but, more, commonly, words, with, umlauts, are, ordered, immediately, after, the, same, word, without, umlauts, as, an, example, in, a, telephone, book, rzte, occurs, after, adressenverlage, but, before, anlagenbauer, because, is, replaced, by, ae, in, a, dictionary, rzte, comes, after, arzt, but, in, some, dictionaries, rzte, and, all, other, words, starting, with, may, occur, after, all, words, starting, with, a, in, some, older, dictionaries, or, indexes, initial, sch, and, st, are, treated, as, separate, letters, and, are, listed, as, separate, entries, after, s, but, they, are, usually, treated, as, s, c, h, and, s, t, written, german, also, typically, uses, an, alternative, opening, inverted, comma, quotation, mark, as, in, guten, morgen, until, the, early, 20th, century, german, was, printed, in, blackletter, typefaces, in, fraktur, and, in, schwabacher, and, written, in, corresponding, handwriting, for, example, kurrent, and, s, tterlin, these, variants, of, the, latin, alphabet, are, very, different, from, the, serif, or, sans, serif, antiqua, typefaces, used, today, and, the, handwritten, forms, in, particular, are, difficult, for, the, untrained, to, read, the, printed, forms, however, were, claimed, by, some, to, be, more, readable, when, used, for, germanic, languages, the, nazis, initially, promoted, fraktur, and, schwabacher, because, they, were, considered, aryan, but, they, abolished, them, in, 1941, claiming, that, these, letters, were, jewish, it, is, believed, that, this, script, was, banned, during, the, nazi, r, gime, as, they, realized, that, fraktur, would, inhibit, communication, in, the, territories, occupied, during, world, war, ii, the, fraktur, script, however, remains, present, in, everyday, life, in, pub, signs, beer, brands, and, other, forms, of, advertisement, where, it, is, used, to, convey, a, certain, rusticality, and, antiquity, a, proper, use, of, the, long, s, langes, s, is, essential, for, writing, german, text, in, fraktur, typefaces, many, antiqua, typefaces, also, include, the, long, s, a, specific, set, of, rules, applies, for, the, use, of, long, s, in, german, text, but, nowadays, it, is, rarely, used, in, antiqua, typesetting, any, lower, case, s, at, the, beginning, of, a, syllable, would, be, a, long, s, as, opposed, to, a, terminal, s, or, short, s, the, more, common, variation, of, the, letter, s, which, marks, the, end, of, a, syllable, for, example, in, differentiating, between, the, words, wach, tube, guard, house, and, wachstube, tube, of, polish, wax, one, can, easily, decide, which, s, to, use, by, appropriate, hyphenation, wach, tube, vs, wachs, tube, the, long, s, only, appears, in, lower, case, german, does, not, have, any, dental, fricatives, the, category, containing, english, th, all, of, the, th, sounds, which, the, english, language, still, has, disappeared, on, the, continent, in, german, with, the, consonant, shifts, between, the, 8th, and, 10th, centuries, it, is, sometimes, possible, to, find, parallels, between, english, and, german, by, replacing, the, english, th, with, d, in, german, e, g, thank, dank, this, and, that, dies, and, das, thou, old, 2nd, person, singular, pronoun, du, think, denken, thirsty, durstig, etc, likewise, the, gh, in, germanic, english, words, pronounced, in, several, different, ways, in, modern, english, as, an, f, or, not, at, all, can, often, be, linked, to, german, ch, e, g, to, laugh, lachen, through, durch, high, hoch, naught, nichts, light, leicht, or, licht, sight, sicht, daughter, tochter, neighbour, nachbar, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, english, gh, was, historically, pronounced, in, the, same, way, as, german, ch, as, x, and, in, an, allophonic, relationship, or, potentially, as, x, in, all, circumstances, as, in, modern, dutch, with, these, word, pairs, originally, up, until, around, the, mid, to, late, 16th, century, sounding, far, more, similar, than, they, do, today, the, german, language, is, used, in, german, literature, and, can, be, traced, back, to, the, middle, ages, with, the, most, notable, authors, of, the, period, being, walther, von, der, vogelweide, and, wolfram, von, eschenbach, the, nibelungenlied, whose, author, remains, unknown, is, also, an, important, work, of, the, epoch, the, fairy, tales, collected, and, published, by, jacob, and, wilhelm, grimm, in, the, 19th, century, became, famous, throughout, the, world, reformer, and, theologian, martin, luther, who, translated, the, bible, into, high, german, a, regional, group, or, german, varieties, at, southern, and, therefore, higher, regions, is, widely, credited, for, attibuted, to, the, basis, for, the, modern, standard, german, language, among, the, best, known, poets, and, authors, in, german, are, lessing, goethe, schiller, kleist, hoffmann, brecht, heine, and, kafka, fourteen, german, speaking, people, have, won, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, theodor, mommsen, rudolf, christoph, eucken, paul, von, heyse, gerhart, hauptmann, carl, spitteler, thomas, mann, nelly, sachs, hermann, hesse, heinrich, b, ll, elias, canetti, g, nter, grass, elfriede, jelinek, herta, m, ller, and, peter, handke, making, it, the, second, most, awarded, linguistic, region, together, with, french, after, english
