in, the, last, fifty, years, administrative, law, in, many, countries, of, the, civil, law, tradition, has, opened, itself, to, the, influence, of, rules, posed, by, supranational, legal, orders, in, which, judicial, principles, have, a, strong, importance, it, has, led, for, one, to, changes, in, some, traditional, concepts, of, the, administrative, law, model, as, has, happened, with, the, public, procurements, or, with, judicial, control, of, administrative, activity, and, for, another, has, built, a, supranational, or, international, public, administration, as, in, the, environmental, sector, or, with, reference, to, education, for, which, within, the, united, nations, system, it, has, been, possible, to, assist, to, a, further, increase, of, administrative, structure, devoted, to, coordinate, the, states, activity, in, that, sector, unlike, most, common, law, jurisdictions, most, civil, law, jurisdictions, have, specialized, courts, or, sections, to, deal, with, administrative, cases, that, as, a, rule, apply, procedural, rules, that, are, specifically, designed, for, such, cases, and, distinct, from, those, applied, in, private, law, proceedings, such, as, contract, or,

through, public, service, to, meet, public, needs, there, is, no, single, specialized, court, to, deal, with, actions, against, the, administrative, entities, but, there, are, several, specialized, courts, and, procedures, of, review, administrative, law, in, china, was, virtually, non, existent, before, the, economic, reform, era, initiated, by, deng, xiaoping, since, the, 1980s, china, has, constructed, a, new, legal, framework, for, administrative, law, establishing, control, mechanisms, for, overseeing, the, bureaucracy, and, disciplinary, committees, for, the, chinese, communist, party, in, 1989, china, established, its, administrative, litigation, law, which, provides, and, avenue, for, people, to, challenge, government, action, 8, in, 2014, it, was, amended, to, lower, the,

in, 1996, administrative, compulsory, law, was, enforced, in, 2012, the, general, administrative, procedure, law, is, underway, in, france, there, is, a, dual, jurisdictional, system, with, the, judiciary, branch, responsible, for, civil, law, and, criminal, law, and, the, administrative, branch, having, jurisdiction, when, a, government, institution, is, involved, most, claims, against, the, national, or, local, governments, as, well, as, claims, against, private, bodies, providing, public, services, are, handled, by, administrative, courts, which, use, the, conseil, d, tat, council, of, state, as, a, court, of, last, resort, for, both, ordinary, and, special, courts, the, main, administrative, courts, are, the, tribunaux, administratifs, and, appeal, courts, are, the, cours, administratives, d, appel, special, administrative, courts, include, the, national, court, of, asylum, right, as, well, as, military, medical, and, judicial, disciplinary, bodies, the, french, body, of, administrative, law, is, called, droit, administratif, over, the, course, of, their, history, france, s, administrative, courts, have, developed, an, extensive, and, coherent, case, law, jurisprudence, constante, and, legal, doctrine, principes, g, n, raux, du, droit, and, principes, fondamentaux, reconnus, par, les, lois, de, la, r, publique, often, before, similar, concepts, were, enshrined, in, constitutional, and, legal, texts, these, principes, include, french, administrative, law, the, basis, of, continental, administrative, law, has, had, a, strong, influence, on, administrative, laws, in, several, other, countries, such, as, belgium, greece, turkey, and, tunisia, in, germany, administrative, law, german, verwaltungsrecht, includes, all, law, that, specifically, governs, the, legal, relationships, between, public, authorities, and, private, persons, and, that, is, not, more, precisely, described, as, constitutional, law, it, sets, out, the, tasks, aims, and, powers, as, well, as, the, organization, and, procedure, for, all, public, authorities, german, beh, rden, as, a, field, of, legal, study, administrative, law, has, been, differentiated, from, other, branches, of, public, law, since, the, late, 19th, century, in, germany, the, precise, delimitations, of, administration, as, a, concept, however, are, in, contention, administrative, law, defines, all, aspects, of, public, administration, in, the, modern, german, state, whose, legal, culture, emphasizes, private, persons, subjective, rights, also, pursuant, to, art, 19, iv, of, the, current, german, constitution, of, 1949, such, rights, must, be, fully, justiciable, final, say, on, the, interpretation, of, the, law, lies, with, the, courts, of, administrative, jurisdiction, german, verwaltungsgerichte, and, the, law, usually, permits, close, judicial, scrutiny, of, public, authorities, exercise, of, discretion, central, legal, principles, of, the, rechtsstaat, rule, of, law, that, pervade, administration, mostly, developed, before, the, adoption, of, the, modern, 1949, constitution, but, strengthened, and, expanded, after, its, advent, by, their, the, new, conceptual, foundation, include, the, vast, majority, of, public, administration, in, germany, is, performed, by, its, component, federal, entities, german, bundes, l, nder, which, are, responsible, for, the, execution, both, of, federal, laws, and, their, own, laws, execution, of, the, laws, directly, by, authorities, of, the, federal, republic, being, the, exceptional, case, as, established, by, artt, 83, et, seqq, of, the, constitution, german, legal, scholarship, does, not, have, an, agreed, upon, definition, for, public, administration, in, one, sense, administration, more, precisely, everything, that, is, subject, to, administrative, law, is, conceptualized, as, being, all, state, activity, of, a, certain, type, material, definition, of, public, administration, this, approach, leads, to, disputes, about, whether, to, treat, acts, of, public, authority, as, acts, of, administration, and, therefore, executive, even, when, they, are, performed, by, component, parts, of, the, state, that, is, to, say, the, government, that, the, law, formally, classifies, as, a, legislative, or, a, judicial, body, for, instance, the, parliament, may, impose, a, fine, on, one, of, its, members, for, misbehavior, or, a, presiding, judge, may, direct, a, disruptive, member, of, the, public, to, be, removed, from, the, viewing, gallery, the, opposite, approach, the, formalist, definition, of, public, administration, begins, its, examination, by, considering, all, those, public, authorities, intended, judging, by, their, lawful, charter, organizational, context, internal, structure, and, performed, tasks, to, do, the, work, of, public, administration, and, equates, their, functioning, with, public, administration, there, is, some, danger, of, circular, reasoning, since, the, formal, categorization, of, the, organizational, unit, may, in, turn, derive, from, some, material, conception, of, its, function, some, functions, that, might, in, the, material, view, be, seen, as, not, of, the, executive, type, and, thus, not, as, belonging, to, the, field, of, administration, such, as, the, creation, of, rules, with, the, force, of, law, which, are, usually, thought, of, as, legislative, would, then, be, held, to, the, standards, of, administrative, law, and, not, another, field, of, law, this, discussion, is, of, seen, as, being, of, particular, importance, when, considering, the, role, of, administrative, law, in, maintaining, the, division, of, government, powers, for, this, purpose, a, traditional, approach, tries, negatively, to, define, administration, by, subtracting, those, operations, of, the, state, which, cannot, be, called, administration, namely, law, making, and, adjudication, using, this, negative, definition, though, requires, law, making, and, adjudication, to, be, defined, first, and, leaves, some, activities, that, are, a, poor, fit, for, the, term, administration, such, as, the, cabinet, government, s, political, leadership, decisions, within, the, bounds, of, the, definition, positive, definitions, abound, but, none, has, won, out, over, the, others, or, been, entirely, convincing, to, scholars, of, german, administrative, law, nevertheless, certain, features, may, be, seen, as, being, charactersitic, of, administration, according, to, maurer, and, waldhoff, administration, is, social, engineering, exerting, influence, on, the, non, state, societal, domain, 1, oriented, towards, some, conception, of, the, ever, changing, public, interest, 2, that, consists, of, taking, action, in, the, present, with, a, view, to, engineering, the, future, 3, and, that, comprises, concrete, measures, to, regulate, individual, cases, and, to, realize, particular, plans, 4, scholarly, treatises, of, german, administrative, law, are, almost, always, split, into, two, parts, doctrines, and, rules, that, can, be, found, across, the, board, allgemeines, verwaltungsrecht, and, doctrines, and, rules, that, exist, only, in, certain, parts, of, administrative, law, german, besonderes, verwaltungsrecht, lit, special, administrative, law, e, g, police, law, urban, planning, law, or, local, government, law, germany, s, principal, piece, of, legislation, concerning, the, legal, forms, and, principles, common, to, most, fields, of, its, public, administration, is, the, law, on, administrative, procedure, german, verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz, abbreviated, vwvfg, before, the, enactment, of, this, law, in, 1977, these, rules, had, only, been, general, principles, developed, in, the, scholarly, literature, and, the, courts, the, vwvfg, is, not, a, full, codification, of, the, generally, applicable, ground, rules, of, german, administrative, law, since, it, mostly, only, determines, the, procedure, to, be, followed, by, public, authorities, in, the, fulfillment, of, their, tasks, rather, than, mandating, the, substance, of, public, administration, the, vwvfg, is, a, federal, law, that, only, applies, to, administration, carried, out, by, the, german, federal, authorities, all, 16, german, l, nder, have, however, enacted, a, law, on, administrative, procedure, of, their, own, that, is, nearly, word, for, word, identical, with, the, federal, vwvfg, the, standard, form, of, administrative, action, is, the, verwaltungsakt, administrative, ordinance, pursuant, to, vwvfg, 35, an, administrative, ordinance, exists, where, a, public, authority, 1, issues, any, decree, decision, or, other, official, measure, 2, in, a, matter, of, public, law, 3, with, immediate, legal, effects, outside, the, administration, 4, to, put, in, place, a, rule, for, an, individual, case, 5, german, legal, scholarship, traditionally, organizes, the, body, of, german, administration, related, law, into, the, following, fields, each, with, its, particular, legal, doctrines, and, written, rules, the, law, governing, the, adjudication, of, questions, of, administrative, law, before, the, courts, of, general, administrative, jurisdiction, german, verwaltungsgerichte, is, the, code, on, administrative, courts, german, verwaltungsgerichtsordnung, abbreviated, vwgo, which, was, enacted, in, 1960, though, the, vwgo, was, not, conceived, as, a, full, codification, of, court, process, for, the, courts, of, general, administrative, jurisdiction, and, vwgo, 173, directs, these, courts, to, apply, germany, s, code, of, civil, procedure, wherever, the, vwgo, lacks, special, rules, proceedings, before, the, courts, of, general, administrative, jurisdiction, are, mostly, distinct, from, civil, proceedings, before, the, courts, of, general, jurisdiction, the, vwgo, also, does, not, apply, to, the, courts, of, special, administrative, jurisdiction, over, tax, disputes, german, finanzgerichte, or, over, social, benefits, disputes, german, sozialgerichte, in, italy, administrative, law, is, known, as, diritto, amministrativo, a, branch, of, public, law, whose, rules, govern, the, organization, of, the, public, administration, and, the, activities, of, the, pursuit, of, the, public, interest, of, the, public, administration, and, the, relationship, between, this, and, the, citizens, its, genesis, is, related, to, the, principle, of, division, of, powers, of, the, state, the, administrative, power, originally, called, executive, is, to, organize, resources, and, people, whose, function, is, devolved, to, achieve, the, public, interest, objectives, as, defined, by, the, law, in, the, netherlands, administrative, law, provisions, are, usually, contained, in, the, various, laws, about, public, services, and, regulations, there, is, however, also, a, single, general, administrative, law, act, algemene, wet, bestuursrecht, or, awb, which, is, a, rather, good, sample, of, procedural, laws, in, europe, it, applies, both, to, the, making, of, administrative, decisions, and, the, judicial, review, of, these, decisions, in, courts, another, act, about, judicial, procedures, in, general, is, the, algemene, termijnenwet, general, time, provisions, act, with, general, provisions, about, time, schedules, in, procedures, on, the, basis, of, the, awb, citizens, can, oppose, a, decision, besluit, made, by, an, administrative, agency, bestuursorgaan, within, the, administration, and, apply, for, judicial, review, in, courts, if, unsuccessful, before, going, to, court, citizens, must, usually, first, object, to, the, decision, with, the, administrative, body, who, made, it, this, is, called, bezwaar, this, procedure, allows, for, the, administrative, body, to, correct, possible, mistakes, themselves, and, is, used, to, filter, cases, before, going, to, court, sometimes, instead, of, bezwaar, a, different, system, is, used, called, administratief, beroep, administrative, appeal, the, difference, with, bezwaar, is, that, administratief, beroep, is, filed, with, a, different, administrative, body, usually, a, higher, ranking, one, than, the, administrative, body, that, made, the, primary, decision, administratief, beroep, is, available, only, if, the, law, on, which, the, primary, decision, is, based, specifically, provides, for, it, an, example, involves, objecting, to, a, traffic, ticket, with, the, district, attorney, officier, van, justitie, after, which, the, decision, can, be, appealed, in, court, unlike, france, or, germany, there, are, no, special, administrative, courts, of, first, instance, in, the, netherlands, but, regular, courts, have, an, administrative, chamber, which, specializes, in, administrative, appeals, the, courts, of, appeal, in, administrative, cases, however, are, specialized, depending, on, the, case, but, most, administrative, appeals, end, up, in, the, judicial, section, of, the, council, of, state, raad, van, state, in, sweden, there, is, a, system, of, administrative, courts, that, considers, only, administrative, law, cases, and, is, completely, separate, from, the, system, of, general, courts, this, system, has, three, tiers, with, 12, county, administrative, courts, f, rvaltningsr, tt, as, the, first, tier, four, administrative, courts, of, appeal, kammarr, tt, as, the, second, tier, and, the, supreme, administrative, court, of, sweden, h, gsta, f, rvaltningsdomstolen, as, the, third, tier, migration, cases, are, handled, in, a, two, tier, system, effectively, within, the, system, general, administrative, courts, three, of, the, administrative, courts, serve, as, migration, courts, migrationsdomstol, with, the, administrative, court, of, appeal, in, stockholm, serving, as, the, migration, court, of, appeal, migrations, verdomstolen, in, taiwan, the, recently, enacted, constitutional, procedure, act, in, 2019, former, constitutional, interpretation, procedure, act, 1993, the, justices, of, the, constitutional, court, of, judicial, yuan, of, taiwan, is, in, charge, of, judicial, interpretation, as, of, 2019, this, council, has, made, 757, interpretations, in, turkey, the, lawsuits, against, the, acts, and, actions, of, the, national, or, local, governments, and, public, bodies, are, handled, by, administrative, courts, which, are, the, main, administrative, courts, the, decisions, of, the, administrative, courts, are, checked, by, the, regional, administrative, courts, and, council, of, state, council, of, state, as, a, court, of, last, resort, is, exactly, similar, to, conseil, d, tat, in, france, administrative, law, in, ukraine, is, a, homogeneous, legal, substance, isolated, in, a, system, of, jurisprudence, characterized, as, 1, a, branch, of, law, 2, a, science, 3, a, discipline, generally, speaking, most, countries, that, follow, the, principles, of, common, law, have, developed, procedures, for, judicial, review, that, limit, the, reviewability, of, decisions, made, by, administrative, law, bodies, often, these, procedures, are, coupled, with, legislation, or, other, common, law, doctrines, that, establish, standards, for, proper, rulemaking, administrative, law, may, also, apply, to, review, of, decisions, of, so, called, semi, public, bodies, such, as, non, profit, corporations, disciplinary, boards, and, other, decision, making, bodies, that, affect, the, legal, rights, of, members, of, a, particular, group, or, entity, while, administrative, decision, making, bodies, are, often, controlled, by, larger, governmental, units, their, decisions, could, be, reviewed, by, a, court, of, general, jurisdiction, under, some, principle, of, judicial, review, based, upon, due, process, united, states, or, fundamental, justice, canada, judicial, review, of, administrative, decisions, is, different, from, an, administrative, appeal, when, sitting, in, review, of, a, decision, the, court, will, only, look, at, the, method, in, which, the, decision, was, arrived, at, whereas, in, an, administrative, appeal, the, correctness, of, the, decision, itself, will, be, examined, usually, by, a, higher, body, in, the, agency, this, difference, is, vital, in, appreciating, administrative, law, in, common, law, countries, the, scope, of, judicial, review, may, be, limited, to, certain, questions, of, fairness, or, whether, the, administrative, action, is, ultra, vires, in, terms, of, ultra, vires, actions, in, the, broad, sense, a, reviewing, court, may, set, aside, an, administrative, decision, if, it, is, unreasonable, under, canadian, law, following, the, rejection, of, the, patently, unreasonable, standard, by, the, supreme, court, in, dunsmuir, v, new, brunswick, wednesbury, unreasonable, under, british, law, or, arbitrary, and, capricious, under, u, s, administrative, procedure, act, and, new, york, state, law, administrative, law, as, laid, down, by, the, supreme, court, of, india, has, also, recognized, two, more, grounds, of, judicial, review, which, were, recognized, but, not, applied, by, english, courts, namely, legitimate, expectation, and, proportionality, the, powers, to, review, administrative, decisions, are, usually, established, by, statute, but, were, originally, developed, from, the, royal, prerogative, writs, of, english, law, such, as, the, writ, of, mandamus, and, the, writ, of, certiorari, in, certain, common, law, jurisdictions, such, as, india, or, pakistan, the, power, to, pass, such, writs, is, a, constitutionally, guaranteed, power, this, power, is, seen, as, fundamental, to, the, power, of, judicial, review, and, an, aspect, of, the, independent, judiciary, in, the, united, states, many, government, agencies, are, organized, under, the, executive, branch, of, government, although, a, few, are, part, of, the, judicial, or, legislative, branches, in, the, federal, government, the, executive, branch, led, by, the, president, controls, the, federal, executive, departments, which, are, led, by, secretaries, who, are, members, of, the, united, states, cabinet, the, many, independent, agencies, of, the, united, states, government, created, by, statutes, enacted, by, congress, exist, outside, of, the, federal, executive, departments, but, are, still, part, of, the, executive, branch, congress, has, also, created, some, special, judicial, bodies, known, as, article, i, tribunals, to, handle, some, areas, of, administrative, law, the, actions, of, executive, agencies, and, independent, agencies, are, the, main, focus, of, american, administrative, law, in, response, to, the, rapid, creation, of, new, independent, agencies, in, the, early, twentieth, century, see, discussion, below, congress, enacted, the, administrative, procedure, act, apa, in, 1946, many, of, the, independent, agencies, operate, as, miniature, versions, of, the, tripartite, federal, government, with, the, authority, to, legislate, through, rulemaking, see, federal, register, and, code, of, federal, regulations, adjudicate, through, administrative, hearings, and, to, execute, administrative, goals, through, agency, enforcement, personnel, because, the, united, states, constitution, sets, no, limits, on, this, tripartite, authority, of, administrative, agencies, congress, enacted, the, apa, to, establish, fair, administrative, law, procedures, to, comply, with, the, constitutional, requirements, of, due, process, agency, procedures, are, drawn, from, four, sources, of, authority, the, apa, organic, statutes, agency, rules, and, informal, agency, practice, it, is, important, to, note, though, that, agencies, can, only, act, within, their, congressionally, delegated, authority, and, must, comply, with, the, requirements, of, the, apa, at, state, level, the, first, version, of, the, model, state, administrative, procedure, act, was, promulgated, and, published, in, 1946, by, the, uniform, law, commission, ulc, in, which, year, the, federal, administrative, procedure, act, was, drafted, it, is, incorporated, basic, principles, with, only, enough, elaboration, of, detail, to, support, essential, features, therefore, it, is, a, model, and, not, a, uniform, act, a, model, act, is, needed, because, state, administrative, law, in, the, states, is, not, uniform, and, there, are, a, variety, of, approaches, used, in, the, various, states, later, it, was, modified, in, 1961, and, 1981, the, present, version, is, the, 2010, model, state, administrative, procedure, act, msapa, which, maintains, the, continuity, with, earlier, ones, the, reason, of, the, revision, is, that, in, the, past, two, decades, state, legislatures, dissatisfied, with, agency, rule, making, and, adjudication, have, enacted, statutes, that, modify, administrative, adjudication, and, rule, making, procedure, the, american, bar, association, s, official, journal, concerning, administrative, law, is, the, administrative, law, review, a, quarterly, publication, that, is, managed, and, edited, by, students, at, the, washington, college, of, law, stephen, breyer, a, u, s, supreme, court, justice, from, 1994, to, 2022, divides, the, history, of, administrative, law, in, the, united, states, into, six, discrete, periods, in, his, book, administrative, law, regulatory, policy, 3d, ed, 1992, the, agricultural, sector, is, one, of, the, most, heavily, regulated, sectors, in, the, u, s, economy, as, it, is, regulated, in, various, ways, at, the, international, federal, state, and, local, levels, consequently, administrative, law, is, a, significant, component, of, the, discipline, of, agricultural, law, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, and, its, myriad, agencies, such, as, the, agricultural, marketing, service, are, the, primary, sources, of, regulatory, activity, although, other, administrative, bodies, such, as, the, environmental, protection, agency, play, a, significant, regulatory, role, as, well
