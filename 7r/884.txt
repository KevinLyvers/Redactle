the, law, of, war, is, a, component, of, international, law, that, regulates, the, conditions, for, initiating, war, jus, ad, bellum, and, the, conduct, of, hostilities, jus, in, bello, laws, of, war, define, sovereignty, and, nationhood, states, and, territories, occupation, and, other, critical, terms, of, law, among, other, issues, modern, laws, of, war, address, the, declarations, of, war, acceptance, of, surrender, and, the, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, military, necessity, along, with, distinction, and, proportionality, and, the, prohibition, of, certain, weapons, that, may, cause, unnecessary, suffering, the, law, of, war, is, considered, distinct, from, other, bodies, of, law, such, as, the, domestic, law, of, a, particular, belligerent, to, a, conflict, which, may, provide, additional, legal, limits, to, the, conduct, or, justification, of, war, the, first, traces, of, a, law, of, war, come, from, the, babylonians, it, is, the, code, of, hammurabi, king, of, babylon, which, in, 1750, b, c, explains, its, laws, imposing, a, code, of, conduct, in, the, event, of, war, i, prescribe, these, laws, so, that, the, strong, do, not, oppress, the, weak, in, ancient, india, the, mahabharata, and, the, texts, of, manou, s, law, urged, mercy, on, unarmed, or, wounded, enemies, the, bible, and, the, qur, an, also, contain, rules, of, respect, for, the, adversary, it, is, always, a, matter, of, establishing, rules, that, protect, civilians, and, the, defeated, attempts, to, define, and, regulate, the, conduct, of, individuals, nations, and, other, agents, in, war, and, to, mitigate, the, worst, effects, of, war, have, a, long, history, the, earliest, known, instances, are, found, in, the, mahabharata, and, the, old, testament, torah, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, mahabharata, describes, a, discussion, between, ruling, brothers, concerning, what, constitutes, acceptable, behavior, on, a, battlefield, an, early, example, of, the, rule, of, proportionality, one, should, not, attack, chariots, with, cavalry, chariot, warriors, should, attack, chariots, one, should, not, assail, someone, in, distress, neither, to, scare, him, nor, to, defeat, him, war, should, be, waged, for, the, sake, of, conquest, one, should, not, be, enraged, toward, an, enemy, who, is, not, trying, to, kill, him, an, example, from, the, book, of, deuteronomy, 20, 19, 20, limits, the, amount, of, environmental, damage, allowing, only, the, cutting, down, of, non, fruitful, trees, for, use, in, the, siege, operation, while, fruitful, trees, should, be, preserved, for, use, as, a, food, source, similarly, deuteronomy, 21, 10, 14, requires, that, female, captives, who, were, forced, to, marry, the, victors, of, a, war, then, not, desired, anymore, be, let, go, wherever, they, want, and, requires, them, not, to, be, treated, as, slaves, nor, be, sold, for, money, in, the, early, 7th, century, the, first, sunni, muslim, caliph, abu, bakr, whilst, instructing, his, muslim, army, laid, down, rules, against, the, mutilation, of, corpses, killing, children, females, and, the, elderly, he, also, laid, down, rules, against, environmental, harm, to, trees, and, slaying, of, the, enemy, s, animals, stop, o, people, that, i, may, give, you, ten, rules, for, your, guidance, in, the, battlefield, do, not, commit, treachery, or, deviate, from, the, right, path, you, must, not, mutilate, dead, bodies, neither, kill, a, child, nor, a, woman, nor, an, aged, man, bring, no, harm, to, the, trees, nor, burn, them, with, fire, especially, those, which, are, fruitful, slay, not, any, of, the, enemy, s, flock, save, for, your, food, you, are, likely, to, pass, by, people, who, have, devoted, their, lives, to, monastic, services, leave, them, alone, in, the, history, of, the, early, christian, church, many, christian, writers, considered, that, christians, could, not, be, soldiers, or, fight, wars, augustine, of, hippo, contradicted, this, and, wrote, about, just, war, doctrine, in, which, he, explained, the, circumstances, when, war, could, or, could, not, be, morally, justified, in, 697, adomnan, of, iona, gathered, kings, and, church, leaders, from, around, ireland, and, scotland, to, birr, where, he, gave, them, the, law, of, the, innocents, which, banned, killing, women, and, children, in, war, and, the, destruction, of, churches, apart, from, chivalry, in, medieval, europe, the, roman, catholic, church, also, began, promulgating, teachings, on, just, war, reflected, to, some, extent, in, movements, such, as, the, peace, and, truce, of, god, the, impulse, to, restrict, the, extent, of, warfare, and, especially, protect, the, lives, and, property, of, non, combatants, continued, with, hugo, grotius, and, his, attempts, to, write, laws, of, war, the, modern, law, of, war, is, made, up, from, three, principal, sources, positive, international, humanitarian, law, consists, of, treaties, international, agreements, that, directly, affect, the, laws, of, war, by, binding, consenting, nations, and, achieving, widespread, consent, the, opposite, of, positive, laws, of, war, is, customary, laws, of, war, many, of, which, were, explored, at, the, nuremberg, war, trials, these, laws, define, both, the, permissive, rights, of, states, as, well, as, prohibitions, on, their, conduct, when, dealing, with, irregular, forces, and, non, signatories, the, treaty, of, armistice, and, regularization, of, war, signed, on, november, 25, and, 26, 1820, between, the, president, of, the, republic, of, colombia, sim, n, bol, var, and, the, chief, of, the, military, forces, of, the, spanish, kingdom, pablo, morillo, is, the, precursor, of, the, international, humanitarian, law, the, treaty, of, guadalupe, hidalgo, signed, and, ratified, by, the, united, states, and, mexico, in, 1848, articulates, rules, for, any, future, wars, including, protection, of, civilians, and, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, the, lieber, code, promulgated, by, the, union, during, the, american, civil, war, was, critical, in, the, development, of, the, laws, of, land, warfare, historian, geoffrey, best, called, the, period, from, 1856, to, 1909, the, law, of, war, s, epoch, of, highest, repute, the, defining, aspect, of, this, period, was, the, establishment, by, states, of, a, positive, legal, or, legislative, foundation, i, e, written, superseding, a, regime, based, primarily, on, religion, chivalry, and, customs, it, is, during, this, modern, era, that, the, international, conference, became, the, forum, for, debate, and, agreement, between, states, and, the, multilateral, treaty, served, as, the, positive, mechanism, for, codification, the, nuremberg, war, trial, judgment, on, the, law, relating, to, war, crimes, and, crimes, against, humanity, held, under, the, guidelines, nuremberg, principles, that, treaties, like, the, hague, convention, of, 1907, having, been, widely, accepted, by, all, civilised, nations, for, about, half, a, century, were, by, then, part, of, the, customary, laws, of, war, and, binding, on, all, parties, whether, the, party, was, a, signatory, to, the, specific, treaty, or, not, interpretations, of, international, humanitarian, law, change, over, time, and, this, also, affects, the, laws, of, war, for, example, carla, del, ponte, the, chief, prosecutor, for, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, pointed, out, in, 2001, that, although, there, is, no, specific, treaty, ban, on, the, use, of, depleted, uranium, projectiles, there, is, a, developing, scientific, debate, and, concern, expressed, regarding, the, effect, of, the, use, of, such, projectiles, and, it, is, possible, that, in, future, there, may, be, a, consensus, view, in, international, legal, circles, that, use, of, such, projectiles, violates, general, principles, of, the, law, applicable, to, use, of, weapons, in, armed, conflict, this, is, because, in, the, future, it, may, be, the, consensus, view, that, depleted, uranium, projectiles, breach, one, or, more, of, the, following, treaties, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, the, charter, of, the, united, nations, the, genocide, convention, the, united, nations, convention, against, torture, the, geneva, conventions, including, protocol, i, the, convention, on, conventional, weapons, of, 1980, the, chemical, weapons, convention, and, the, convention, on, the, physical, protection, of, nuclear, material, it, has, often, been, commented, that, creating, laws, for, something, as, inherently, lawless, as, war, seems, like, a, lesson, in, absurdity, but, based, on, the, adherence, to, what, amounted, to, customary, international, humanitarian, law, by, warring, parties, through, the, ages, it, was, believed, by, many, especially, after, the, eighteenth, century, that, codifying, laws, of, war, would, be, beneficial, some, of, the, central, principles, underlying, laws, of, war, are, to, this, end, laws, of, war, are, intended, to, mitigate, the, hardships, of, war, by, the, idea, that, there, is, a, right, to, war, concerns, on, the, one, hand, the, jus, ad, bellum, the, right, to, make, war, or, to, enter, war, assuming, a, motive, such, as, to, defend, oneself, from, a, threat, or, danger, presupposes, a, declaration, of, war, that, warns, the, adversary, war, is, a, loyal, act, and, on, the, other, hand, jus, in, bello, the, law, of, war, the, way, of, making, war, which, involves, behaving, as, soldiers, invested, with, a, mission, for, which, all, violence, is, not, allowed, in, any, case, the, very, idea, of, a, right, to, war, is, based, on, an, idea, of, war, that, can, be, defined, as, an, armed, conflict, limited, in, space, limited, in, time, and, by, its, objectives, war, begins, with, a, declaration, of, war, ends, with, a, treaty, of, peace, or, surrender, agreement, an, act, of, sharing, etc, military, necessity, along, with, distinction, proportionality, humanity, sometimes, called, unnecessary, suffering, and, honor, sometimes, called, chivalry, are, the, five, most, commonly, cited, principles, of, international, humanitarian, law, governing, the, legal, use, of, force, in, an, armed, conflict, military, necessity, is, governed, by, several, constraints, an, attack, or, action, must, be, intended, to, help, in, the, defeat, of, the, enemy, it, must, be, an, attack, on, a, legitimate, military, objective, and, the, harm, caused, to, protected, civilians, or, civilian, property, must, be, proportional, and, not, excessive, in, relation, to, the, concrete, and, direct, military, advantage, anticipated, distinction, is, a, principle, under, international, humanitarian, law, governing, the, legal, use, of, force, in, an, armed, conflict, whereby, belligerents, must, distinguish, between, combatants, and, protected, civilians, proportionality, is, a, principle, under, international, humanitarian, law, governing, the, legal, use, of, force, in, an, armed, conflict, whereby, belligerents, must, make, sure, that, the, harm, caused, to, protected, civilians, or, civilian, property, is, not, excessive, in, relation, to, the, concrete, and, direct, military, advantage, expected, by, an, attack, on, a, legitimate, military, objective, however, as, robbie, sabel, professor, of, international, law, at, the, hebrew, university, who, has, written, on, this, topic, notes, anyone, with, experience, in, armed, conflict, knows, that, you, want, to, hit, the, enemy, s, forces, harder, than, they, hit, you, if, you, are, attacked, with, a, rifle, there, is, no, rule, that, stipulates, that, you, can, only, shoot, back, with, a, rifle, but, using, a, machine, gun, would, not, be, fair, or, that, if, you, are, attacked, with, only, one, tank, you, cannot, shoot, back, with, two, humanity, is, a, principle, based, on, the, 1907, hague, convention, iv, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, on, land, restrictions, against, using, arms, projectiles, or, materials, calculated, to, cause, suffering, or, injury, manifestly, disproportionate, to, the, military, advantage, realized, by, the, use, of, the, weapon, for, legitimate, military, purposes, in, some, countries, weapons, are, reviewed, prior, to, their, use, in, combat, to, determine, if, they, comply, with, the, law, of, war, and, are, not, designed, to, cause, unnecessary, suffering, when, used, in, their, intended, manner, this, principle, also, prohibits, using, an, otherwise, lawful, weapon, in, a, manner, that, causes, unnecessary, suffering, honour, is, a, principle, that, demands, a, certain, amount, of, fairness, and, mutual, respect, between, adversaries, parties, to, a, conflict, must, accept, that, their, right, to, adopt, means, of, injuring, each, other, is, not, unlimited, they, must, refrain, from, taking, advantage, of, the, adversary, s, adherence, to, the, law, by, falsely, claiming, the, law, s, protections, and, they, must, recognize, that, they, are, members, of, a, common, profession, that, fights, not, out, of, personal, hostility, but, on, behalf, of, their, respective, states, to, fulfill, the, purposes, noted, above, the, laws, of, war, place, substantive, limits, on, the, lawful, exercise, of, a, belligerent, s, power, generally, speaking, the, laws, require, that, belligerents, refrain, from, employing, violence, that, is, not, reasonably, necessary, for, military, purposes, and, that, belligerents, conduct, hostilities, with, regard, for, the, principles, of, humanity, and, chivalry, however, because, the, laws, of, war, are, based, on, consensus, as, the, nature, of, international, law, often, relies, on, self, policing, by, individual, states, the, content, and, interpretation, of, such, laws, are, extensive, contested, and, ever, changing, the, following, are, particular, examples, of, some, of, the, substance, of, the, laws, of, war, as, those, laws, are, interpreted, today, section, iii, of, the, hague, convention, of, 1907, required, hostilities, to, be, preceded, by, a, reasoned, declaration, of, war, or, by, an, ultimatum, with, a, conditional, declaration, of, war, some, treaties, notably, the, united, nations, charter, 1945, article, 2, and, other, articles, in, the, charter, seek, to, curtail, the, right, of, member, states, to, declare, war, as, does, the, older, kellogg, briand, pact, of, 1928, for, those, nations, who, ratified, it, see, certified, true, copy, of, the, text, of, the, treaty, in, league, of, nations, treaty, series, vol, 94, p, 57, no, 2137, modern, laws, of, war, regarding, conduct, during, war, jus, in, bello, such, as, the, 1949, geneva, conventions, provide, that, it, is, unlawful, for, belligerents, to, engage, in, combat, without, meeting, certain, requirements, article, 4, a, 2, of, the, geneva, convention, relative, to, the, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, recognizes, lawful, combatants, by, the, following, characteristics, impersonating, enemy, combatants, by, wearing, the, enemy, s, uniform, is, possibly, allowed, however, the, issue, is, unsettled, fighting, in, that, uniform, is, unlawful, perfidy, as, is, the, taking, of, hostages, combatants, also, must, be, commanded, by, a, responsible, officer, that, is, a, commander, can, be, held, liable, in, a, court, of, law, for, the, improper, actions, of, their, subordinates, there, is, an, exception, to, this, if, the, war, came, on, so, suddenly, that, there, was, no, time, to, organize, a, resistance, e, g, as, a, result, of, a, foreign, occupation, modern, laws, of, war, specifically, within, protocol, i, additional, to, the, 1949, geneva, conventions, prohibits, attacking, people, parachuting, from, an, aircraft, in, distress, regardless, of, what, territory, they, are, over, once, they, land, in, territory, controlled, by, the, enemy, they, must, be, given, an, opportunity, to, surrender, before, being, attacked, unless, it, is, apparent, that, they, are, engaging, in, a, hostile, act, or, attempting, to, escape, this, prohibition, does, not, apply, to, the, dropping, of, airborne, troops, special, forces, commandos, spies, saboteurs, liaison, officers, and, intelligence, agents, thus, such, personnel, descending, by, parachutes, are, legitimate, targets, and, therefore, may, be, attacked, even, if, their, aircraft, is, in, distress, modern, laws, of, war, such, as, the, 1949, geneva, conventions, also, include, prohibitions, on, attacking, doctors, ambulances, or, hospital, ships, displaying, a, red, cross, a, red, crescent, magen, david, adom, red, crystal, or, other, emblem, related, to, the, international, red, cross, and, red, crescent, movement, it, is, also, prohibited, to, fire, at, a, person, or, vehicle, bearing, a, white, flag, since, that, indicates, an, intent, to, surrender, or, a, desire, to, communicate, in, either, case, people, protected, by, the, red, cross, crescent, star, or, white, flag, are, expected, to, maintain, neutrality, and, may, not, engage, in, warlike, acts, in, fact, engaging, in, war, activities, under, a, protected, symbol, is, itself, a, violation, of, the, laws, of, war, known, as, perfidy, failure, to, follow, these, requirements, can, result, in, the, loss, of, protected, status, and, make, the, individual, violating, the, requirements, a, lawful, target, the, law, of, war, is, binding, not, only, upon, states, as, such, but, also, upon, individuals, and, in, particular, the, members, of, their, armed, forces, parties, are, bound, by, the, laws, of, war, to, the, extent, that, such, compliance, does, not, interfere, with, achieving, legitimate, military, goals, for, example, they, are, obliged, to, make, every, effort, to, avoid, damaging, people, and, property, not, involved, in, combat, or, the, war, effort, but, they, are, not, guilty, of, a, war, crime, if, a, bomb, mistakenly, or, incidentally, hits, a, residential, area, by, the, same, token, combatants, that, intentionally, use, protected, people, or, property, as, human, shields, or, camouflage, are, guilty, of, violations, of, the, laws, of, war, and, are, responsible, for, damage, to, those, that, should, be, protected, the, use, of, contracted, combatants, in, warfare, has, been, an, especially, tricky, situation, for, the, laws, of, war, some, scholars, claim, that, private, security, contractors, appear, so, similar, to, state, forces, that, it, is, unclear, if, acts, of, war, are, taking, place, by, private, or, public, agents, international, law, has, yet, to, come, to, a, consensus, on, this, issue, during, conflict, punishment, for, violating, the, laws, of, war, may, consist, of, a, specific, deliberate, and, limited, violation, of, the, laws, of, war, in, reprisal, after, a, conflict, ends, persons, who, have, committed, or, ordered, any, breach, of, the, laws, of, war, especially, atrocities, may, be, held, individually, accountable, for, war, crimes, also, nations, that, signed, the, geneva, conventions, are, required, to, search, for, try, and, punish, anyone, who, had, committed, or, ordered, certain, grave, breaches, of, the, laws, of, war, third, geneva, convention, article, 129, and, article, 130, combatants, who, break, specific, provisions, of, the, laws, of, war, are, termed, unlawful, combatants, unlawful, combatants, who, have, been, captured, may, lose, the, status, and, protections, that, would, otherwise, be, afforded, to, them, as, prisoners, of, war, but, only, after, a, competent, tribunal, has, determined, that, they, are, not, eligible, for, pow, status, e, g, third, geneva, convention, article, 5, at, that, point, an, unlawful, combatant, may, be, interrogated, tried, imprisoned, and, even, executed, for, their, violation, of, the, laws, of, war, pursuant, to, the, domestic, law, of, their, captor, but, they, are, still, entitled, to, certain, additional, protections, including, that, they, be, treated, with, humanity, and, in, case, of, trial, shall, not, be, deprived, of, the, rights, of, fair, and, regular, trial, fourth, geneva, convention, article, 5, list, of, declarations, conventions, treaties, and, judgments, on, the, laws, of, war
