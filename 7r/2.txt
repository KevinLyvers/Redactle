body, language, is, a, type, of, communication, in, which, physical, behaviors, as, opposed, to, words, are, used, to, express, or, convey, information, such, behavior, includes, facial, expressions, body, posture, gestures, eye, movement, touch, and, the, use, of, space, the, term, body, language, is, usually, applied, in, regard, to, people, but, may, also, be, applied, to, animals, the, study, of, body, language, is, also, known, as, kinesics, although, body, language, is, an, important, part, of, communication, most, of, it, happens, without, conscious, awareness, body, language, differs, from, sign, language, which, are, languages, with, complex, grammar, systems, and, exhibiting, the, fundamental, properties, considered, to, exist, in, all, true, languages, body, language, on, the, other, hand, does, not, have, a, grammar, system, and, must, be, interpreted, broadly, instead, of, having, an, absolute, meaning, corresponding, with, a, certain, movement, it, is, technically, not, a, language, body, language, more, so, refers, to, the, often, unconscious, reactions, we, tend, to, have, in, relation, to, observed, stimuli, within, a, society, consensus, exists, regarding, the, accepted, understandings, and, interpretations, of, specific, behaviors, there, also, is, controversy, on, whether, body, language, is, universal, body, language, a, subset, of, nonverbal, communication, complements, verbal, communication, in, social, interaction, in, fact, some, researchers, conclude, that, nonverbal, communication, accounts, for, the, majority, of, information, transmitted, during, interpersonal, interactions, it, helps, to, establish, the, relationship, between, two, people, and, regulates, interaction, yet, it, can, be, ambiguous, the, interpretation, of, body, language, tends, to, vary, in, different, cultural, contexts, facial, expression, is, a, part, of, body, language, and, the, expression, of, emotion, an, accurate, interpretation, of, it, relies, on, interpreting, multiple, signs, in, combination, such, as, the, movement, of, the, eyes, eyebrows, lips, nose, and, cheeks, in, order, to, form, an, impression, of, a, person, s, mood, and, state, of, mind, it, should, always, be, additionally, considered, in, regard, to, the, context, in, which, it, is, occurring, and, the, person, s, likely, intention, while, facial, body, language, can, be, interpreted, as, a, sign, of, genuine, emotion, a, lack, of, it, may, suggest, a, lack, of, sincerity, for, example, a, lack, of, wrinkles, around, the, eyes, may, suggest, a, potentially, fake, smile, at, one, point, researchers, believed, that, making, a, genuine, smile, was, nearly, impossible, to, do, on, command, more, recently, however, a, study, conducted, by, researchers, at, northeastern, university, found, that, people, could, convincingly, fake, a, duchenne, smile, even, when, they, were, not, feeling, especially, happy, the, action, of, the, pupil, corresponds, to, mood, and, it, can, communicate, the, mood, of, a, person, when, it, is, observed, for, instance, the, research, found, that, the, person, has, no, control, over, his, pupils, and, they, expanded, when, someone, was, interested, in, another, person, or, when, they, were, looking, at, something, normally, one, s, eyes, need, to, instinctively, blink, at, around, 20, times, per, minute, but, merely, looking, at, a, person, the, viewer, finds, attractive, can, make, this, rate, faster, studies, and, behavioral, experiments, have, shown, that, facial, expressions, and, bodily, expressions, are, congruent, in, terms, of, conveying, visible, signs, of, a, person, s, emotional, state, this, means, that, the, brain, processes, the, other, s, facial, and, bodily, expressions, simultaneously, subjects, in, these, studies, judged, emotions, based, on, facial, expressions, with, a, high, level, of, accuracy, this, is, because, the, face, and, the, body, are, normally, seen, together, in, their, natural, proportions, and, the, emotional, signals, from, the, face, and, body, are, well, integrated, nodding, of, the, head, is, generally, considered, a, sign, of, saying, yes, when, used, in, conversation, it, may, be, interpreted, as, a, sign, of, approval, and, encourage, the, speaker, to, go, on, a, single, nod, of, the, head, is, a, sign, of, acknowledging, another, person, in, a, respectful, manner, in, this, manner, it, can, be, regarded, as, similar, to, the, asian, practice, of, bowing, to, a, person, as, a, sign, of, respect, shaking, the, head, is, usually, interpreted, as, meaning, no, in, india, a, head, bobble, is, the, tilting, of, the, head, from, side, to, side, whose, interpretation, can, be, ambiguous, and, context, dependent, a, tilting, of, the, head, to, the, side, can, be, an, expression, of, interest, in, what, the, other, person, is, communicating, it, may, be, a, sign, of, curiosity, uncertainty, or, questioning, if, the, head, is, propped, up, by, the, hand, when, the, head, is, tilted, then, this, may, indicate, disinterest, or, be, a, sign, of, thinking, about, something, a, head, that, is, tilted, forwards, slightly, while, being, pulled, backward, may, indicate, being, suspicious, the, angle, of, facing, and, positioning, of, a, person, s, head, can, be, indicative, of, their, mood, this, should, be, considered, in, conjunction, with, patterns, of, muscular, tension, that, occur, concurrently, with, it, such, as, that, of, the, face, and, neck, when, the, head, is, tilted, up, this, may, demonstrate, what, some, academics, refer, to, as, superiority, emotions, such, as, self, assurance, pride, or, contempt, when, it, is, tilted, down, this, may, indicate, inferiority, emotions, such, as, shame, shyness, or, respect, when, other, factors, are, incorporated, such, as, the, intensity, of, the, feeling, or, gender, for, example, the, most, accurate, interpretation, can, change, joy, for, instance, is, a, superior, emotion, that, is, typically, found, in, conjunction, with, a, head, tilted, up, contentment, which, may, be, considered, to, be, on, the, same, spectrum, as, joy, but, at, a, lesser, intensity, may, instead, feature, the, head, being, angled, down, somewhat, as, a, person, s, vocal, chords, are, influenced, physically, by, the, tilt, of, their, head, and, the, respective, pattern, of, muscle, tension, it, is, possible, to, discern, their, head, tilt, by, listening, to, how, they, talk, emotions, can, also, be, detected, through, body, postures, research, has, shown, that, body, postures, are, more, accurately, recognized, when, an, emotion, is, compared, with, a, different, or, neutral, emotion, for, example, a, person, feeling, angry, would, portray, dominance, over, the, other, and, their, posture, would, display, approach, tendencies, comparing, this, to, a, person, feeling, fearful, they, would, feel, weak, and, submissive, and, their, posture, would, display, avoidance, tendencies, sitting, or, standing, postures, also, indicate, one, s, emotions, a, person, sitting, still, in, the, back, of, their, chair, leaning, forward, with, their, head, nodding, along, with, the, discussion, implies, that, they, are, open, relaxed, and, generally, ready, to, listen, on, the, other, hand, a, person, who, has, their, legs, and, arms, crossed, with, the, foot, kicking, slightly, implies, that, they, are, feeling, impatient, and, emotionally, detached, from, the, discussion, this, being, said, interpretation, of, said, behavior, can, vary, cross, culturally, in, a, standing, discussion, a, person, standing, with, arms, akimbo, with, feet, pointed, towards, the, speaker, could, suggest, that, they, are, attentive, and, interested, in, the, conversation, however, a, small, difference, in, this, posture, could, mean, a, lot, in, bali, standing, with, arms, akimbo, is, considered, rude, and, may, send, signals, of, aggression, in, general, terms, the, relative, fullness, or, shallowness, of, the, chest, especially, around, the, sternum, can, be, a, key, indicator, of, both, mood, and, attitude, when, the, body, language, of, the, chest, is, assessed, in, everyday, circumstances, it, involves, an, instinctive, assessment, of, these, factors, of, shape, and, volume, when, the, posture, of, the, chest, is, fuller, and, it, is, positioned, relatively, forward, then, this, is, a, sign, of, confidence, if, it, is, thrusting, prominently, forward, then, this, may, be, an, indication, that, the, person, wants, to, be, socially, prominent, and, make, a, statement, of, physical, confidence, when, the, chest, is, pulled, back, then, this, can, indicate, a, less, confident, attitude, if, a, person, positions, their, chest, closer, towards, another, person, it, may, be, a, sign, of, paying, closer, attention, to, them, as, part, of, a, conversation, or, in, other, circumstances, it, may, be, a, sign, of, physical, assertion, and, aggression, gestures, are, movements, made, with, body, parts, example, hands, arms, fingers, head, legs, and, they, may, be, voluntary, or, involuntary, arm, gestures, can, be, interpreted, in, several, ways, in, a, discussion, when, one, stands, sits, or, even, walks, with, folded, arms, it, is, normally, not, a, welcoming, gesture, it, could, mean, that, they, have, a, closed, mind, and, are, most, likely, unwilling, to, listen, to, the, speaker, s, viewpoint, another, type, of, arm, gesture, also, includes, an, arm, crossed, over, the, other, demonstrating, insecurity, and, a, lack, of, confidence, hand, gestures, often, signify, the, state, of, well, being, of, the, person, making, them, relaxed, hands, indicate, confidence, and, self, assurance, while, clenched, hands, may, be, interpreted, as, signs, of, stress, or, anger, if, a, person, is, wringing, their, hands, this, demonstrates, nervousness, and, anxiety, finger, gestures, are, also, commonly, used, to, exemplify, one, s, speech, as, well, as, denote, the, state, of, well, being, of, the, person, making, them, in, certain, cultures, pointing, using, one, s, index, finger, is, deemed, acceptable, however, pointing, at, a, person, may, be, viewed, as, aggressive, in, other, cultures, for, example, people, who, share, hindu, beliefs, consider, finger, pointing, offensive, instead, they, point, with, a, palm, up, open, hand, likewise, the, thumbs, up, gesture, could, show, ok, or, good, in, countries, like, the, united, states, south, africa, france, lebanon, and, germany, but, this, same, gesture, is, insulting, in, other, countries, like, iran, bangladesh, and, thailand, where, it, is, the, equivalent, of, showing, the, middle, finger, in, the, us, it, is, difficult, to, distinguish, a, behavior, motivated, by, an, out, group, bias, a, negative, response, to, a, member, of, a, different, group, from, one, fueled, by, stereotype, effect, a, cognitive, association, between, members, of, a, specific, out, group, and, a, culturally, held, belief, hamilton, 1981, handshakes, are, regular, greeting, rituals, and, commonly, used, when, meeting, greeting, offering, congratulations, expressing, camaraderie, or, after, the, completion, of, an, agreement, studies, have, categorized, several, handshake, styles, including, the, finger, squeeze, the, bone, crusher, shaking, hands, too, strongly, the, limp, fish, shaking, hands, too, weakly, etc, handshakes, are, popular, in, the, united, states, and, are, appropriate, for, use, between, men, and, women, however, in, muslim, cultures, men, may, not, shake, hands, or, touch, women, in, any, way, and, vice, versa, likewise, in, hindu, cultures, hindu, men, may, never, shake, hands, with, women, instead, they, greet, women, by, placing, their, hands, as, if, praying, a, firm, friendly, handshake, has, long, been, recommended, in, the, business, world, as, a, way, to, make, a, good, first, impression, and, the, greeting, is, thought, to, date, to, ancient, times, as, a, way, of, showing, a, stranger, you, had, no, weapons, body, language, related, to, breathing, and, patterns, of, breathing, can, be, indicative, of, a, person, s, mood, and, state, of, mind, because, of, this, the, relationship, between, body, language, and, breathing, is, often, considered, in, contexts, such, as, business, meetings, and, presentations, oculesics, a, subcategory, of, body, language, is, the, study, of, eye, movement, eye, behavior, gaze, and, eye, related, nonverbal, communication, as, a, social, or, behavioral, science, oculesics, is, a, form, of, nonverbal, communication, focusing, on, deriving, meaning, from, eye, behavior, oculesics, is, culturally, dependent, for, example, in, traditional, anglo, saxon, culture, avoiding, eye, contact, usually, portrays, a, lack, of, confidence, certainty, or, truthfulness, however, in, the, latino, culture, direct, or, prolonged, eye, contact, means, that, you, are, challenging, the, individual, with, whom, you, are, speaking, or, that, you, have, a, romantic, interest, in, the, person, also, in, many, asian, cultures, prolonged, eye, contact, may, be, a, sign, of, anger, or, aggression, research, has, also, shown, that, people, can, accurately, decode, distinct, emotions, by, merely, watching, others, communicate, via, touch, heslin, outlines, five, haptic, categories, the, amount, of, touching, that, occurs, within, a, culture, is, also, culturally, dependent, another, notable, area, in, the, nonverbal, world, of, body, language, is, that, of, spatial, relationships, which, is, also, known, as, proxemics, introduced, by, edward, t, hall, in, 1966, proxemics, is, the, study, of, measurable, distances, between, people, as, they, interact, with, one, another, in, the, book, body, language, julius, fast, mentioned, that, the, signals, that, we, send, or, receive, to, others, through, body, language, are, reactions, to, others, invasions, of, our, personal, territories, hall, also, came, up, with, four, distinct, zones, in, which, most, people, operate, intimate, distance, for, embracing, touching, or, whispering, personal, distance, for, interactions, among, good, friends, or, family, members, social, distance, for, interactions, among, acquaintances, public, distance, used, for, public, speaking, in, addition, to, physical, distance, the, level, of, intimacy, between, conversants, can, be, determined, by, socio, petal, socio, fugal, axis, or, the, angle, formed, by, the, axis, of, the, conversants, shoulders, changing, the, distance, between, two, people, can, convey, a, desire, for, intimacy, declare, a, lack, of, interest, or, increase, decrease, domination, it, can, also, influence, the, body, language, that, is, used, for, example, when, people, talk, they, like, to, face, each, other, if, forced, to, sit, side, by, side, their, body, language, will, try, to, compensate, for, this, lack, of, eye, to, eye, contact, by, leaning, in, shoulder, to, shoulder, as, with, other, types, of, body, language, proximity, range, varies, with, culture, hall, suggested, that, physical, contact, between, two, people, can, be, perfectly, correct, in, one, culture, and, absolutely, taboo, in, another, one, of, the, reasons, for, this, is, that, when, a, person, s, mood, changes, so, does, their, breathing, pattern, this, influences, their, body, language, and, also, their, intra, abdominal, pressure, iap, which, is, a, direct, influence, on, and, discernible, in, their, tone, of, voice, for, example, if, a, person, is, feeling, confident, then, their, breathing, pattern, will, deepen, their, iap, will, increase, and, their, tone, of, voice, will, sound, fuller, and, stronger, if, they, are, feeling, anxious, their, breathing, will, become, too, shallow, their, iap, will, decrease, and, their, voice, will, sound, thinner, and, weaker, thus, based, upon, a, person, s, mood, being, reflected, in, their, breathing, pattern, which, is, a, fundamental, influencing, factor, to, both, tone, of, voice, and, body, language, their, tone, of, voice, will, tend, to, convey, the, same, sense, of, mood, as, their, body, language, and, vice, versa, notably, hands, free, devices, which, use, a, digital, voice, such, as, amazon, s, alexa, tend, to, omit, or, limit, the, sound, of, iap, from, the, digital, voice, the, voice, therefore, lacks, a, human, like, fullness, of, tone, and, sounds, more, robotic, certain, body, postures, can, significantly, influence, the, tone, of, voice, for, instance, if, someone, is, speaking, while, sitting, in, a, chair, with, a, hunched, back, then, this, obstructs, the, breathing, system, including, the, throat, and, may, muffle, the, tone, of, voice, and, convey, the, impression, of, being, deenergised, unhappy, or, bored, whereas, if, they, were, sitting, up, straight, this, would, allow, the, breathing, system, to, be, unobstructed, and, the, tone, of, voice, to, be, clearer, more, energetic, and, focused, human, communication, is, extremely, complex, and, one, must, look, at, the, whole, in, order, to, make, any, determination, as, to, the, attitudes, being, expressed, body, language, is, a, major, contributor, to, the, attitude, a, person, conveys, to, others, albert, mehrabian, maintains, that, during, a, conversation, dealing, with, feelings, and, attitudes, i, e, like, dislike, 7, of, what, is, communicated, is, via, what, is, said, 38, is, via, tone, of, voice, and, the, majority, 55, is, via, body, language, this, is, also, referred, to, as, the, 7, 38, 55, rule, and, is, often, considered, in, studies, of, human, communications, while, there, is, a, wider, debate, about, the, percentage, share, which, should, be, attributed, to, each, of, the, three, contributing, factors, it, is, generally, agreed, upon, that, body, language, plays, a, fundamental, role, in, determining, the, attitude, a, person, conveys, a, person, may, alter, their, body, language, in, order, to, alter, the, attitude, they, convey, this, may, in, turn, influence, the, rapport, they, have, with, another, person, whether, a, formal, or, informal, attitude, is, conveyed, may, influence, the, other, person, s, response, for, instance, if, an, interviewer, conveys, a, formal, attitude, then, this, gives, a, more, business, like, impression, which, may, encourage, the, interviewee, to, give, more, serious, answers, this, may, develop, a, more, professional, rapport, overall, between, them, alternatively, if, the, interviewer, conveys, an, informal, attitude, then, this, conveys, a, more, open, and, casual, impression, this, may, be, used, to, elicit, a, more, open, response, from, the, interviewee, encourage, them, to, give, more, revealing, answers, and, potentially, develop, a, more, personal, rapport, it, doesn, t, matter, if, it, s, a, friendship, or, a, business, relationship, there, has, to, be, a, certain, level, of, trust, between, people, understanding, body, language, will, help, you, to, build, trust, and, rapport, trust, is, fundamental, to, all, positive, relationships, between, people, body, language, which, expresses, trust, will, usually, convey, a, sense, of, openness, and, warmth, contrarily, mistrusting, body, language, will, appear, relatively, closed, and, cold, body, language, which, conveys, a, sense, of, trust, can, vary, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, relationship, for, example, for, business, friendships, and, intimate, relationships, there, may, be, similarities, in, the, body, language, used, but, it, can, also, be, significantly, different, body, language, which, conveys, trust, in, a, business, context, is, done, so, in, a, formal, manner, this, is, in, keeping, with, business, etiquette, in, general, where, people, present, themselves, in, a, professional, and, focused, manner, which, also, overtly, recognises, that, the, relationship, has, boundaries, a, businessperson, like, approach, signals, to, another, person, that, they, can, trust, that, business, will, be, the, main, focus, of, the, conversation, and, not, anything, else, the, handshake, is, used, commonly, in, business, at, the, start, of, a, meeting, or, negotiation, it, shows, that, each, person, is, willing, to, trust, the, other, it, may, be, accompanied, by, a, warm, smile, but, it, would, not, usually, be, accompanied, by, more, familiar, less, formal, body, language, such, as, a, broad, grin, or, pat, on, the, shoulder, business, body, language, specifically, attempts, to, avoid, body, language, that, conveys, mistrust, for, example, if, someone, crosses, their, arms, or, legs, while, speaking, in, a, business, context, it, can, give, the, impression, of, a, barrier, being, presented, to, the, other, person, that, person, may, then, think, that, the, person, speaking, does, not, trust, them, or, is, hiding, something, because, barrier, type, body, language, may, signal, mistrust, it, is, avoided, in, business, contexts, body, language, between, friends, is, typically, more, expressive, and, informal, than, body, language, in, business, trust, within, a, friendship, is, conveyed, in, numerous, different, expressive, forms, like, in, business, a, handshake, may, be, used, on, meeting, but, this, may, also, involve, clasping, two, hands, around, one, hand, or, placing, a, hand, on, the, shoulder, etc, body, language, which, conveys, trust, between, friends, may, also, be, significantly, more, expressive, and, physical, than, in, business, giving, someone, a, pat, on, the, back, or, a, hug, for, example, people, s, natural, willingness, to, act, openly, and, warmly, with, their, friends, who, they, know, well, can, appear, more, genuine, when, compared, with, how, strangers, present, themselves, as, trustworthy, in, a, business, context, this, is, because, friends, can, read, each, other, s, body, language, and, facial, expressions, more, easily, this, means, that, they, are, surer, of, what, the, other, person, means, and, find, it, easier, to, respond, accordingly, the, interaction, is, therefore, able, to, be, more, open, and, this, can, be, seen, when, observing, friends, interact, the, communication, whether, in, terms, of, body, language, or, speech, is, freer, and, less, constrained, by, a, sense, of, formal, etiquette, the, body, language, of, trust, in, intimate, relationships, such, as, courtship, and, marriage, is, very, open, and, often, highly, personalised, even, if, it, is, not, necessarily, as, physically, dynamic, as, that, found, in, a, friendship, for, example, in, western, contexts, holding, hands, is, a, common, sign, between, intimate, partners, that, expresses, their, affection, and, trust, in, each, other, it, is, a, gentle, act, which, may, extend, over, several, minutes, or, more, in, contrast, a, handshake, between, friends, may, be, quite, exuberant, and, last, for, a, few, seconds, trust, is, also, conveyed, in, intimate, relationships, through, people, caressing, and, kissing, each, other, these, actions, are, designed, to, convey, openness, and, warmth, in, a, highly, personalised, way, each, partner, is, communicating, to, the, other, that, they, are, attracted, to, them, and, also, that, they, trust, them, and, are, allowing, them, to, touch, them, in, a, more, intimate, way, than, would, otherwise, be, acceptable, such, body, language, may, be, established, gradually, over, a, period, of, courtship, the, body, language, of, intimate, relationships, cannot, be, used, acceptably, in, non, intimate, relationships, when, people, are, in, an, intimate, relationship, they, often, position, themselves, closer, to, each, other, than, if, they, were, in, a, different, kind, of, relationship, even, though, it, may, only, be, a, small, distance, closer, together, an, observer, can, interpret, this, additional, closeness, to, mean, that, they, are, in, an, intimate, relationship, for, example, spouses, may, sit, stand, and, walk, in, each, other, s, intimate, space, whereas, business, colleagues, may, maintain, more, of, a, distance, and, outside, of, each, other, s, intimate, space, as, the, spouses, are, in, an, intimate, relationship, they, do, not, feel, the, need, to, maintain, the, same, distance, as, the, business, colleagues, other, signs, that, people, who, are, in, an, intimate, relationship, may, give, include, an, impression, that, they, feel, at, ease, in, each, other, s, company, are, committed, to, each, other, and, a, sense, of, naturalness, when, you, get, onto, a, basketball, court, all, your, teammates, beside, you, pumped, up, and, ready, to, go, you, form, impressions, of, the, other, side, their, strength, and, unity, their, mood, and, body, language, of, course, the, physicality, element, is, stronger, in, sport, but, something, similar, happens, in, politics, where, you, can, read, the, mood, of, one, side, or, the, other, simply, by, looking, at, them, sitting, there, all, together, body, language, can, convey, the, impression, of, a, readiness, to, take, action, while, this, is, always, observable, in, the, physical, sense, it, can, be, further, categorised, as, being, readiness, for, physical, exertion, or, readiness, for, social, interaction, noting, that, a, person, will, typically, be, ready, for, both, at, any, given, time, and, such, categorisations, are, based, upon, which, course, of, action, they, are, primarily, ready, for, at, that, moment, such, states, of, readiness, influence, the, person, s, whole, body, tone, of, voice, and, what, impression, they, convey, through, their, body, language, a, state, of, increased, readiness, may, also, be, referred, to, as, being, in, a, state, of, high, energy, or, intensity, relative, to, states, of, unreadiness, most, states, of, readiness, typically, involve, a, deeper, breathing, pattern, increased, excitation, of, the, nervous, system, and, an, increased, heart, rate, such, physiological, effects, also, influence, the, person, s, skin, and, its, fullness, of, appearance, in, relative, terms, a, person, s, skin, will, usually, look, fuller, and, more, taut, while, in, a, state, of, readiness, and, thinner, and, more, flaccid, in, a, state, of, unreadiness, a, readiness, for, physical, exertion, typically, means, that, these, effects, are, increased, further, in, terms, of, their, intensity, and, visual, prominence, this, is, when, a, person, prepares, themself, for, significant, physical, exertion, for, example, before, a, sportsperson, begins, to, play, they, have, prepared, themself, by, warming, up, their, body, and, psychologically, focusing, on, the, task, ahead, they, are, thereby, in, a, state, of, readiness, to, exert, themself, to, an, observer, they, appear, to, be, pumped, up, their, body, language, is, suggestive, that, they, are, about, to, move, quickly, and, more, energetically, they, appear, physically, larger, and, their, movements, are, often, bigger, a, body, language, warm, up, routine, consisting, of, power, poses, may, also, be, used, by, people, to, prepare, themselves, for, a, social, engagement, harvard, professor, amy, cuddy, suggested, in, 2010, that, two, minutes, of, power, posing, standing, tall, holding, your, arms, out, or, toward, the, sky, or, standing, like, superman, with, your, hands, on, hips, could, increase, confidence, but, retracted, the, advice, and, stopped, teaching, it, after, a, 2015, study, was, unable, to, replicate, the, effect, scholars, have, long, debated, on, whether, body, language, particularly, facial, expressions, are, universally, understood, in, darwin, s, 1872, evolutionary, theory, he, postulated, that, facial, expressions, of, emotion, are, inherited, on, the, other, hand, scholars, have, questioned, if, culture, influences, one, s, bodily, expression, of, emotions, broadly, the, theories, can, be, categorized, into, two, models, the, cultural, equivalence, model, predicts, that, individuals, should, be, equally, accurate, in, understanding, the, emotions, of, ingroup, and, outgroup, members, soto, levenson, 2009, this, model, is, rooted, in, darwin, s, evolutionary, theory, where, he, noted, that, both, humans, and, animals, share, similar, postural, expressions, of, emotions, such, as, anger, aggression, happiness, and, fear, these, similarities, support, the, evolution, argument, that, social, animals, including, humans, have, a, natural, ability, to, relay, emotional, signals, with, one, another, a, notion, shared, by, several, academics, chevalier, skolnikoff, 1974, linnankoski, laakso, aulanko, leinonen, 1994, where, darwin, notes, similarity, in, expression, among, animals, and, humans, the, cultural, equivalence, model, notes, similarity, in, expression, across, cultures, in, humans, even, though, they, may, be, completely, different, one, of, the, strongest, pieces, of, evidence, that, supports, this, model, was, a, study, conducted, by, paul, ekman, and, friesen, 1971, where, members, of, a, preliterate, tribe, in, papua, new, guinea, reliably, recognized, the, facial, expressions, of, individuals, from, the, united, states, culturally, isolated, and, with, no, exposure, to, us, media, there, was, no, possibility, of, cross, cultural, transmission, to, the, papuan, tribesmen, on, the, other, hand, the, cultural, advantage, model, predicts, that, individuals, of, the, same, race, process, the, visual, characteristics, more, accurately, and, efficiently, than, other, race, faces, other, factors, that, increase, accurate, interpretation, include, familiarity, with, nonverbal, accents, there, are, numerous, studies, that, support, both, the, cultural, equivalence, model, and, the, cultural, advantage, model, but, reviewing, the, literature, indicates, that, there, is, a, general, consensus, that, seven, emotions, are, universally, recognized, regardless, of, cultural, background, happiness, surprise, fear, anger, contempt, disgust, and, sadness, recently, scholars, have, shown, that, the, expressions, of, pride, and, shame, are, universal, tracy, and, robins, 2008, concluded, that, the, expression, of, pride, includes, an, expanded, posture, of, the, body, with, the, head, tilted, back, with, a, low, intensity, face, and, a, non, duchenne, smile, raising, the, corner, of, the, mouth, the, expression, of, shame, includes, the, hiding, of, the, face, either, by, turning, it, down, or, covering, it, with, the, hands, fundamentally, body, language, is, seemed, as, an, involuntary, and, unconscious, phenomenon, that, adds, to, the, process, of, communication, despite, that, there, have, been, certain, areas, where, the, conscious, harnessing, of, body, language, both, in, action, and, comprehension, have, been, useful, the, use, of, body, language, has, also, seen, an, increase, in, application, and, use, commercially, with, large, volumes, of, books, and, guides, published, designed, to, teach, people, how, to, be, conscious, of, body, language, and, how, to, use, it, to, benefit, them, in, certain, scenarios, the, use, of, body, language, can, be, seen, in, a, wide, variety, of, fields, body, languages, has, seen, applications, in, instructional, teaching, in, areas, such, as, second, language, acquisition, and, also, to, enhance, the, teaching, of, subjects, like, mathematics, a, related, use, of, body, language, is, as, a, substitution, to, verbal, language, to, people, who, lack, the, ability, to, use, that, be, it, because, of, deafness, or, aphasia, body, language, has, also, been, applied, in, the, process, of, detecting, deceit, through, micro, expressions, both, in, law, enforcement, and, even, in, the, world, of, poker, the, importance, of, body, language, in, second, language, acquisition, was, inspired, by, the, fact, that, to, successfully, learn, a, language, is, to, achieve, discourse, strategic, and, sociolinguistic, competencies, sociolinguistic, competence, includes, understanding, the, body, language, that, aids, the, use, of, a, particular, language, this, is, usually, also, highly, culturally, influenced, as, such, a, conscious, ability, to, recognize, and, even, perform, this, sort, of, body, language, is, necessary, to, achieve, fluency, in, a, language, beyond, the, discourse, level, the, importance, of, body, language, to, verbal, language, use, is, the, need, to, eliminate, ambiguity, and, redundancy, in, comprehension, pennycook, 1985, suggests, to, limit, the, use, of, non, visual, materials, to, facilitate, the, teaching, of, a, second, language, to, improve, this, aspect, of, communication, he, calls, this, being, not, just, bilingual, but, also, bi, kinesic, body, language, can, be, a, useful, aid, not, only, in, teaching, a, second, language, but, also, in, other, areas, the, idea, behind, using, it, is, as, a, nonlinguistic, input, it, can, be, used, to, guide, hint, or, urge, a, student, towards, the, right, answer, this, is, usually, paired, off, with, other, verbal, methods, of, guiding, the, student, be, it, through, confirmation, checks, or, modified, language, use, tai, in, his, 2014, paper, provides, a, list, of, three, main, characteristic, of, body, language, and, how, they, influence, teaching, the, features, are, intuition, communication, and, suggestion, despite, the, absence, of, evidence, indicating, that, non, verbal, lie, detection, works, and, its, rejection, by, the, scholarly, community, as, an, effective, way, to, detect, lies, law, enforcement, still, relies, on, it, numerous, federal, bureau, of, investigation, fbi, law, enforcement, bulletins, have, addressed, body, language, as, a, purported, tool, for, evaluation, truthfulness, and, detecting, deception, the, body, language, of, the, members, of, law, enforcement, might, influence, the, accuracy, of, eyewitness, accounts, the, game, of, poker, involves, not, only, an, understanding, of, probability, but, also, the, competence, of, reading, and, analyzing, the, body, language, of, the, opponents, a, key, component, of, poker, is, to, be, able, to, bluff, opponents, to, spot, bluffing, players, must, have, the, ability, to, spot, the, individual, tics, of, their, opponents, known, in, poker, as, their, tells, players, also, have, to, look, out, for, signs, that, an, opponent, is, doing, well, body, language, is, often, used, to, achieve, a, humorous, effect, in, comedy, productions, this, may, involve, using, body, language, which, is, exaggerated, repetitious, inappropriate, for, the, circumstances, or, for, the, character, and, any, combination, of, these, two, or, more, characters, can, be, used, to, emphasise, each, other, s, body, language, their, gestures, and, mannerisms, may, be, very, similar, and, in, this, manner, amplify, their, comedic, effect, or, they, may, be, very, different, and, thereby, highlighted, by, way, of, contrast, comedy, double, acts, standardly, use, such, methods, of, complementary, comedic, body, language, kinesics, is, the, study, and, interpretation, of, nonverbal, communication, related, to, the, movement, of, any, part, of, the, body, or, the, body, as, a, whole, in, layman, s, terms, it, is, the, study, of, body, language, however, ray, birdwhistell, who, is, considered, the, founder, of, this, area, of, study, never, used, the, term, body, language, and, did, not, consider, it, appropriate, he, argued, that, what, can, be, conveyed, with, the, body, does, not, meet, the, linguist, s, definition, of, language, birdwhistell, pointed, out, that, human, gestures, differ, from, those, of, other, animals, in, that, they, are, polysemic, that, they, can, be, interpreted, to, have, many, different, meanings, depending, on, the, communicative, context, in, which, they, are, produced, and, he, resisted, the, idea, that, body, language, could, be, deciphered, in, some, absolute, fashion, he, also, indicated, that, every, body, movement, must, be, interpreted, broadly, and, in, conjunction, with, every, other, element, in, communication, despite, that, body, language, is, still, more, widely, used, than, kinesics, dr, maziar, mir, in, his, book, body, language, of, iran, has, defined, body, language, as, follows, to, all, gestures, postures, movements, human, behaviour, body, gestures, and, even, model, and, gesture, of, speaking, or, all, postures, of, making, sounds, without, making, a, sound, that, is, based, on, the, age, sex, height, weight, and, social, or, geographical, status, of, human, beings, are, referred, to, as, body, language, or, non, verbal, communication, indeed, a, bowed, head, probably, leads, raters, to, perceive, the, contraction, of, the, zygomatic, major, action, unit, 12, and, a, raised, head, to, perceive, the, contraction, of, the, triangularis, action, unit, 15, second, although, we, found, no, significant, difference, in, the, perception, of, mouth, contraction, at, zero, degrees, between, male, and, female, actors, a, large, difference, is, perceived, at, other, head, angles, even, though, the, expression, itself, is, fixed, such, a, correspondence, can, be, deliberately, manipulated, to, produce, different, effects, for, example, an, actor, can, pose, in, a, confident, manner, while, relaxing, muscles, in, the, neck, which, would, ordinarily, be, more, contracted, in, conjunction, with, the, pose, he, may, thereby, make, it, appear, that, he, is, actually, afraid, and, the, pose, is, merely, an, attempt, to, appear, confident
