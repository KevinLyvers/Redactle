and, staff, worldwide, it, was, founded, to, protect, human, life, and, health, to, ensure, respect, for, all, human, beings, and, to, prevent, and, alleviate, human, suffering, until, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, there, were, no, organized, or, well, established, army, nursing, systems, for, casualties, nor, safe, or, protected, institutions, to, accommodate, and, treat, those, who, were, wounded, on, the, battlefield, a, devout, calvinist, the, swiss, businessman, jean, henri, dunant, traveled, to, italy, to, meet, then, french, emperor, napoleon, iii, in, june, 1859, with,

he, completely, abandoned, the, original, intent, of, his, trip, and, for, several, days, he, devoted, himself, to, helping, with, the, treatment, and, care, for, the, wounded, he, took, point, in, organizing, an, overwhelming, level, of, relief, assistance, with, the, local, villagers, to, aid, without, discrimination, back, at, his, home, in, geneva, he, decided, to, write, a, book, entitled,

thought, could, help, him, make, a, change, his, book, included, vivid, descriptions, of, his, experiences, in, solferino, in, 1859, and, he, explicitly, advocated, the, formation, of, national, voluntary, relief, organizations, to, help, nurse, wounded, soldiers, in, the, case, of, war, inspired, by, christian, teaching, regarding, social, responsibility, and, his, experience, after, the, battlefield, of, solferino, he, called, for, the, development, of, an, international, treaty, to, guarantee, the, protection, of, medics, and, field, hospitals, for, soldiers, wounded, on, the, battlefield, in, 1863, gustave, moynier, a, geneva, lawyer, and, president, of, the, geneva, society, for, public, welfare, received, a, copy, of, dunant, s, book, and, introduced, it, for, discussion, at, a, meeting, of, that, society, as, a, result, of, this, initial, discussion, the, society, established, an, investigatory, commission, to, examine, the, feasibility, of, dunant, s, suggestions, and, eventually, to, organize, an, international, conference, about, their, possible, implementation, the, members, of, this, committee, which, has, subsequently, been, referred, to, as, the, committee, of, the, five, aside, from, dunant, and, moynier, were, physician, louis, appia, who, had, significant, experience, working, as, a, field, surgeon, appia, s, friend, and, colleague,

all, european, countries, as, well, as, the, united, states, the, empire, of, brazil, and, the, mexican, empire, to, attend, an, official, diplomatic, conference, sixteen, countries, sent, a, total, of, 26, delegates, to, geneva, on, 22, august, 1864, the, conference, adopted, the, first, geneva, convention, for, the, amelioration, of, the, condition, of, the, wounded, in, armies, in, the, field, representatives, of, 12, states, and, kingdoms, signed, the, convention, the, convention, contained, ten, articles, establishing, for, the, first, time, legally, binding, rules, guaranteeing,

geneva, convention, the, first, national, societies, were, founded, in, belgium, denmark, france, oldenburg, italy, prussia, spain, and, w, rttemberg, also, in, 1864, louis, appia, and, charles, van, de, velde, a, captain, of, the, dutch, army, became, the, first, independent, and, neutral, delegates, to, work, under, the, symbol, of, the, red, cross, in, an, armed, conflict, the, ottoman, government, ratified, this, treaty, on, 5, july, 1865, the, turkish, red, crescent, organization, was, founded, in, the, ottoman, empire, in, 1868, partly, in, response, to, the, experience, of, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, in, which, disease, overshadowed, battle, as, the, main, cause, of, death, and, suffering, among, turkish, soldiers, it, was, the, first, red, crescent, society, of, its, kind, and, one, of, the, most, important, charity, organizations, in, the, muslim, world, in, 1867, the, first, international, conference, of, national, aid, societies, for, the, nursing, of, the, war, wounded, was, convened, also, in, 1867, jean, henri, dunant, was, forced, to, declare, bankruptcy, due, to, business, failures, in, algeria, partly, because, he, had, neglected, his, business, interests, during, his, tireless, activities, for, the, international, committee, the, controversy, surrounding, dunant, s, business, dealings, and, the, resulting, negative, public, opinion, combined, with, an, ongoing, conflict, with, gustave, moynier, led, to, dunant, s, expulsion, from, his, position, as, a, member, and, secretary, he, was, charged, with, fraudulent, bankruptcy, and, a, warrant, for, his, arrest, was, issued, thus, he, was, forced, to, leave, geneva, and, never, returned, to, his, home, city, in, the, following, years, national, societies, were, founded, in, nearly, every, country, in, europe, the, project, resonated, well, with, patriotic, sentiments, that, were, on, the, rise, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, and, national, societies, were, often, encouraged, as, signifiers, of, national, moral, superiority, in, 1876, the, committee, adopted, the, name, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, icrc, which, is, still, its, official, designation, today, five, years, later, the, american, red, cross, was, founded, through, the, efforts, of, clara, barton, more, and, more, countries, signed, the, geneva, convention, and, began, to, respect, it, in, practice, during, armed, conflicts, in, a, rather, short, period, of, time, the, red, cross, gained, huge, momentum, as, an, internationally, respected, movement, and, the, national, societies, became, increasingly, popular, as, a, venue, for, volunteer, work, when, the, first, nobel, peace, prize, was, awarded, in, 1901, the, norwegian, nobel, committee, opted, to, give, it, jointly, to, jean, henri, dunant, and, fr, d, ric, passy, a, leading, international, pacifist, more, significant, than, the, honor, of, the, prize, itself, this, prize, marked, the, overdue, rehabilitation, of, jean, henri, dunant, and, represented, a, tribute, to, his, key, role, in, the, formation, of, the, red, cross, dunant, died, nine, years, later, in, the, small, swiss, health, resort, of, heiden, only, two, months, earlier, his, long, standing, adversary, gustave, moynier, had, also, died, leaving, a, mark, in, the, history, of, the, committee, as, its, longest, serving, president, ever, in, 1906, the, 1864, geneva, convention, was, revised, for, the, first, time, one, year, later, the, hague, convention, x, adopted, at, the, second, international, peace, conference, in, the, hague, extended, the, scope, of, the, geneva, convention, to, naval, warfare, shortly, before, the, beginning, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1914, 50, years, after, the, foundation, of, the, icrc, and, the, adoption, of, the, first, geneva, convention, there, were, already, 45, national, relief, societies, throughout, the, world, the, movement, had, extended, itself, beyond, europe, and, north, america, to, central, and, south, america, argentine, republic, the, united, states, of, brazil, the, republic, of, chile, the, republic, of, cuba, the, united, mexican, states, the,

kingdom, of, siam, and, africa, union, of, south, africa, with, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, the, icrc, found, itself, confronted, with, enormous, challenges, that, it, could, handle, only, by, working, closely, with, the, national, red, cross, societies, red, cross, nurses, from, around, the, world, including, the, united, states, and, japan, came, to, support, the, medical, services, of, the, armed, forces, of, the, european, countries, involved, in, the, war, on, 15, august, 1914, immediately, after, the, start, of, the, war, the, icrc, set, up, its, international, prisoners, of, war, agency, ipwa, to, trace, pows, and, to, re, establish, communications, with, their, respective, families, the, austrian, writer, and, pacifist, stefan, zweig, described, the, situation, at, the, geneva, headquarters, of, the, icrc, hardly, had, the, first, blows, been, struck, when, cries, of, anguish, from, all, lands, began, to, be, heard, in, switzerland, thousands, who, were, without, news, of, fathers, husbands, and, sons, in, the, battlefields, stretched, despairing, arms, into, the, void, by, hundreds, by, thousands, by, tens, of, thousands, letters, and, telegrams, poured, into, the, little, house, of, the, red, cross, in, geneva, the, only, international, rallying, point, that, still, remained, isolated, like, stormy, petrels, came, the, first, inquiries, for, missing, relatives, then, these, inquiries, themselves, became, a, storm, the, letters, arrived, in, sackfuls, nothing, had, been, prepared, for, dealing, with, such, an, inundation, of, misery, the, red, cross, had, no, space, no, organization, no, system, and, above, all, no, helpers, however, by, the, end, of, the, year, the, agency, already, had, some, 1, 200, volunteers, who, worked, in, the, mus, e, rath, of, geneva, amongst, them, the, french, writer, and, pacifist, romain, rolland, when, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, for, 1915, he, donated, half, of, the, prize, money, to, the, agency, most, of, the, staff, were, women, some, of, whom, like, marguerite, van, berchem, marguerite, cramer, and, suzanne, ferri, re, served, in, high, positions, as, pioneers, of, gender, equality, in, an, organisation, dominated, by, men, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, agency, had, transferred, about, 20, million, letters, and, messages, 1, 9, million, parcels, and, about, 18, million, swiss, francs, in, monetary, donations, to, pows, of, all, affected, countries, furthermore, due, to, the, intervention, of, the, agency, about, 200, 000, prisoners, were, exchanged, between, the, warring, parties, released, from, captivity, and, returned, to, their, home, country, the, organizational, card, index, of, the, agency, accumulated, about, 7, million, records, from, 1914, to, 1923, the, card, index, led, to, the, identification, of, about, 2, million, pows, and, the, ability, to, contact, their, families, the, complete, index, is, on, loan, today, from, the, icrc, to, the, international, red, cross, and, red, crescent, museum, in, geneva, the, right, to, access, the, index, is, still, strictly, restricted, to, the, icrc, during, the, entire, war, the, icrc, monitored, warring, parties, compliance, with, the, geneva, conventions, of, the, 1907, revision, and, forwarded, complaints, about, violations, to, the, respective, country, when, chemical, weapons, were, used, in, this, war, for, the, first, time, in, history, the, icrc, mounted, a, vigorous, protest, against, their, use, even, without, having, a, mandate, from, the, geneva, conventions, the, icrc, tried, to, ameliorate, the, suffering, of, civil, populations, in, territories, that, were, officially, designated, as, occupied, territories, the, icrc, could, assist, the, civilian, population, on, the, basis, of, the, hague, convention, s, laws, and, customs, of, war, on, land, of, 1907, this, convention, was, also, the, legal, basis, for, the, icrc, s, work, for, prisoners, of, war, in, addition, to, the, work, of, the, international, prisoner, of, war, agency, as, described, above, this, included, inspection, visits, to, pow, camps, a, total, of, 524, camps, throughout, europe, were, visited, by, 41, delegates, from, the, icrc, through, the, end, of, the, war, between, 1916, and, 1918, the, icrc, published, a, number, of, postcards, with, scenes, from, the, pow, camps, the, pictures, showed, the, prisoners, in, day, to, day, activities, such, as, the, distribution, of, letters, from, home, the, intention, of, the, icrc, was, to, provide, the, families, of, the, prisoners, with, some, hope, and, solace, and, to, alleviate, their, uncertainties, about, the, fate, of, their, loved, ones, after, the, end, of, the, war, between, 1920, and, 1922, the, icrc, organized, the, return, of, about, 500, 000, prisoners, to, their, home, countries, in, 1920, the, task, of, repatriation, was, handed, over, to, the, newly, founded, league, of, nations, which, appointed, the, norwegian, diplomat, and, scientist, fridtjof, nansen, as, its, high, commissioner, for, repatriation, of, the, war, prisoners, his, legal, mandate, was, later, extended, to, support, and, care, for, war, refugees, and, displaced, persons, when, his, office, became, that, of, the, league, of, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, nansen, who, invented, the, nansen, passport, for, stateless, refugees, and, was, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, 1922, appointed, two, delegates, from, the, icrc, as, his, deputies, a, year, before, the, end, of, the, war, the, icrc, received, the, 1917, nobel, peace, prize, for, its, outstanding, wartime, work, it, was, the, only, nobel, peace, prize, awarded, in, the, period, from, 1914, to, 1918, in, 1923, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, adopted, a, change, in, its, policy, regarding, the, selection, of, new, members, until, then, only, citizens, from, the, city, of, geneva, could, serve, in, the, committee, this, limitation, was, expanded, to, include, all, swiss, citizens, as, a, direct, consequence, of, world, war, i, a, treaty, was, adopted, in, 1925, which, outlawed, the, use, of, suffocating, or, poisonous, gases, and, biological, agents, as, weapons, four, years, later, the, original, convention, was, revised, and, the, second, geneva, convention, relative, to, the, amelioration, of, the, condition, of, wounded, sick, and, shipwrecked, members, of, armed, forces, at, sea, was, established, the, events, of, world, war, i, and, the, respective, activities, of, the, icrc, significantly, increased, the, reputation, and, authority, of, the, committee, among, the, international, community, and, led, to, an, extension, of, its, competencies, as, early, as, in, 1934, a, draft, proposal, for, an, additional, convention, for, the, protection, of, the, civil, population, in, occupied, territories, during, an, armed, conflict, was, adopted, by, the, international, red, cross, conference, unfortunately, most, governments, had, little, interest, in, implementing, this, convention, and, it, was, thus, prevented, from, entering, into, force, before, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, the, red, cross, response, to, the, holocaust, has, been, the, subject, of, significant, controversy, and, criticism, as, early, as, may, 1944, the, icrc, was, criticized, for, its, indifference, to, jewish, suffering, and, death, criticism, that, intensified, after, the, end, of, the, war, when, the, full, extent, of, the, holocaust, became, undeniable, one, defense, to, these, allegations, is, that, the, red, cross, was, trying, to, preserve, its, reputation, as, a, neutral, and, impartial, organization, by, not, interfering, with, what, was, viewed, as, a, german, internal, matter, the, red, cross, also, considered, its, primary, focus, to, be, prisoners, of, war, whose, countries, had, signed, the, geneva, convention, the, geneva, conventions, in, their, 1929, revision, formed, the, legal, basis, of, the, work, of, the, icrc, during, world, war, ii, the, activities, of, the, committee, were, similar, to, those, during, world, war, i, visiting, and, monitoring, pow, camps, organizing, relief, assistance, for, civilian, populations, and, administering, the, exchange, of, messages, regarding, prisoners, and, missing, persons, by, the, end, of, the, war, 179, delegates, had, conducted, 12, 750, visits, to, pow, camps, in, 41, countries, the, central, information, agency, on, prisoners, of, war, agence, centrale, des, prisonniers, de, guerre, had, a, staff, of, 3, 000, the, card, index, tracking, prisoners, contained, 45, million, cards, and, 120, million, messages, were, exchanged, by, the, agency, one, major, obstacle, was, that, the, nazi, controlled, german, red, cross, refused, to, cooperate, with, the, geneva, statutes, including, blatant, violations, such, as, the, deportation, of, jews, from, germany, and, the, mass, murders, conducted, in, the, nazi, concentration, camps, two, other, main, parties, to, the, conflict, the, soviet, union, and, japan, were, not, party, to, the, 1929, geneva, conventions, and, were, not, legally, required, to, follow, the, rules, of, the, conventions, during, the, war, the, icrc, was, unable, to, obtain, an, agreement, with, nazi, germany, about, the, treatment, of, detainees, in, concentration, camps, and, the, icrc, eventually, abandoned, applying, pressure, saying, later, it, did, so, in, order, to, avoid, disrupting, its, work, with, pows, the, icrc, was, also, unable, to, obtain, a, response, to, reliable, information, about, the, extermination, camps, and, the, mass, killing, of, european, jews, roma, et, al, after, november, 1943, the, icrc, achieved, permission, to, send, parcels, to, concentration, camp, detainees, with, known, names, and, locations, because, the, notices, of, receipt, for, these, parcels, were, often, signed, by, other, inmates, the, icrc, managed, to, register, the, identities, of, about, 105, 000, detainees, in, the, concentration, camps, and, delivered, about, 1, 1, million, parcels, primarily, to, the, concentration, camps, dachau, buchenwald, ravensbr, ck, and, sachsenhausen, maurice, rossel, was, sent, to, berlin, as, a, delegate, of, the, international, red, cross, he, visited, theresienstadt, ghetto, in, 1944, the, choice, of, the, inexperienced, rossel, for, this, mission, has, been, interpreted, as, indicative, of, his, organization, s, indifference, to, the, jewish, problem, while, his, report, has, been, described, as, emblematic, of, the, failure, of, the, icrc, to, advocate, for, jews, during, the, holocaust, rossel, s, report, was, noted, for, its, uncritical, acceptance, of, nazi, propaganda, he, erroneously, stated, that, jews, were, not, deported, from, theresienstadt, claude, lanzmann, recorded, his, experiences, in, 1979, producing, a, documentary, entitled, a, visitor, from, the, living, on, 12, march, 1945, icrc, president, jacob, burckhardt, received, a, message, from, ss, general, ernst, kaltenbrunner, allowing, icrc, delegates, to, visit, the, concentration, camps, this, agreement, was, bound, by, the, condition, that, these, delegates, would, have, to, stay, in, the, camps, until, the, end, of, the, war, ten, delegates, among, them, louis, haefliger, mauthausen, gusen, paul, dunant, theresienstadt, and, victor, maurer, dachau, accepted, the, assignment, and, visited, the, camps, louis, haefliger, prevented, the, forceful, eviction, or, blasting, of, mauthausen, gusen, by, alerting, american, troops, friedrich, born, 1903, 1963, an, icrc, delegate, in, budapest, who, saved, the, lives, of, about, 11, 000, to, 15, 000, jewish, people, in, hungary,

national, red, cross, societies, to, organize, relief, assistance, to, those, countries, most, severely, affected, in, 1948, the, committee, published, a, report, reviewing, its, war, era, activities, from, 1, september, 1939, to, 30, june, 1947, the, icrc, opened, its, archives, from, world, war, ii, in, 1996, on, 12, august, 1949, further, revisions, to, the, existing, two, geneva, conventions, were, adopted, an, additional, convention, for, the, amelioration, of, the, condition, of, wounded, sick, and, shipwrecked, members, of, armed, forces, at, sea, now, called, the, second, geneva, convention, was, brought, under, the, geneva, convention, umbrella, as, a, successor, to, the, 1907, hague, convention, x, the, 1929, geneva, convention, relative, to, the, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, may, have, been, the, second, geneva, convention, from, a, historical, point, of, view, because, it, was, actually, formulated, in, geneva, but, after, 1949, it, came, to, be, called, the, third, convention, because, it, came, later, chronologically, than, the, hague, convention, reacting, to, the, experience, of, world, war, ii, the, fourth, geneva, convention, a, new, convention, relative, to, the, protection, of, civilian, persons, in, time, of, war, was, established, also, the, additional, protocols, of, 8, june, 1977, were, intended, to, make, the, conventions, apply, to, internal, conflicts, such, as, civil, wars, today, the, four, conventions, and, their, added, protocols, contain, more, than, 600, articles, while, there, were, only, 10, articles, in, the, first,

which, were, not, caused, by, war, such, as, man, made, or, natural, disasters, the, arc, already, had, great, disaster, relief, mission, experience, extending, back, to, its, foundation, the, formation, of, the, league, as, an, additional, international, red, cross, organization, alongside, the, icrc, was, not, without, controversy, for, a, number, of, reasons, the, icrc, had, to, some, extent, valid, concerns, about, a, possible, rivalry, between, the, two, organizations, the, foundation, of, the, league, was, seen, as, an, attempt, to, undermine, the, leadership, position, of, the, icrc, within, the, movement, and, to, gradually, transfer, most, of, its, tasks, and, competencies, to, a, multilateral, institution, in, addition, to, that, all, founding, members, of, the, league, were, national, societies, from, countries, of, the, entente, or, from, associated, partners, of, the, entente, the, original, statutes, of, the, league, from, may, 1919, contained, further, regulations, which, gave, the, five, founding, societies, a, privileged, status, and, due, to, the, efforts, of, henry, davison, the, right, to, permanently, exclude, the, national, red, cross, societies, from, the, countries, of, the, central, powers, namely, germany, austria, hungary, bulgaria, and, turkey, and, in, addition, to, that, the, national, red, cross, society, of, russia, these, rules, were, contrary, to, the, red, cross, principles, of, universality, and, equality, among, all, national, societies, a, situation, which, furthered, the, concerns, of, the, icrc, the, first, relief, assistance, mission, organized, by, the, league, was, an, aid, mission, for, the, victims, of, a, famine, and, subsequent, typhus, epidemic, in, poland, only, five, years, after, its, foundation, the, league, had, already, issued, 47, donation, appeals, for, missions, in, 34, countries, an, impressive, indication, of, the, need, for, this, type, of, red, cross, work, the, total, sum, raised, by, these, appeals, reached, 685, million, swiss, francs, which, were, used, to, bring, emergency, supplies, to, the, victims, of, famines, in, russia, germany, and, albania, earthquakes, in, chile, persia, japan, colombia, ecuador, costa, rica, and, turkey, and, refugee, flows, in, greece, and, turkey, the, first, large, scale, disaster, mission, of, the, league, came, after, the,

japan, received, goods, from, its, sister, societies, reaching, a, total, worth, of, about, 100, million, another, important, new, field, initiated, by, the, league, was, the, creation, of, youth,

societies, organized, assistance, missions, and, the, distribution, of, food, and, other, aid, goods, for, civil, populations, affected, by, hunger, and, disease, the, icrc, worked, with, the, russian, red, cross, society, and, later, the, society, of, the, soviet, union, constantly, emphasizing, the, icrc, s, neutrality, in, 1928, the, international, council, was, founded, to, coordinate,

for, the, first, time, defining, the, respective, roles, of, the, icrc, and, the, league, within, the, movement, during, the, abyssinian, war, between, ethiopia, and, italy, from, 1935, to, 1936, the, league, contributed, aid, supplies, worth, about, 1, 7, million, swiss, francs, because, the, italian, fascist, regime, under, benito, mussolini, refused, any, cooperation, with, the, red, cross, these, goods, were, delivered, solely, to, ethiopia, during, the, war, an, estimated, 29, people, died, while, being, under, explicit, protection, of, the, red, cross, symbol, most, of, them, due, to, attacks, by, the, italian, army, during, the, civil, war, in, spain, from, 1936, to, 1939, the, league, once, again, joined, forces, with, the, icrc, with, the, support, of, 41, national, societies, in, 1939, on, the, brink, of, the, second, world, war, the, league, relocated, its, headquarters, from, paris, to, geneva, to, take, advantage, of, swiss, neutrality, in, 1952, the, 1928, common, statute, of, the, movement, was, revised, for, the, first, time, also, the, period, of, decolonization, from, 1960, to, 1970, was, marked, by, a, huge, jump, in, the, number, of, recognized, national,

the, nobel, peace, prize, in, 1983, the, league, was, renamed, to, the, league, of, red, cross, and, red, crescent, societies, to, reflect, the, growing, number, of, national, societies, operating, under, the, red, crescent, symbol, three, years, later, the, seven, basic, principles, of, the, movement, as, adopted, in, 1965, were, incorporated, into, its, statutes, the, name, of, the, league, was, changed, again, in, 1991, to, its, current, official, designation, the, international, federation, of, red, cross, and, red, crescent, societies, in, 1997, the, icrc, and, the, ifrc, signed, the,

which, are, shared, by, all, components, of, the, movement, and, they, were, added, to, the, official, statutes, of, the, movement, in, 1986, the, durability, and, universal, acceptance, is, a, result, of, the, process, through, which, they, came, into, being, in, the, form, they, have, rather, than, an, effort, to, arrive, at, agreement, it, was, an, attempt, to, discover, what, successful, operations, and, organisational, units, over, the, past, 100, years, had, in, common, as, a, result, the, fundamental, principles, of, the, red, cross, and, red, crescent, were, not, revealed, but, found, through, a, deliberate, and, participative, process, of, discovery, that, makes, it, even, more, important, to, note, that, the, definition, that, appears, for, each, principle, is, an,

concerns, of, territorialism, the, red, cross, emblem, was, officially, approved, in, geneva, in, 1863, the, red, cross, flag, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, saint, george, s, cross, depicted, on, the, flags, of, england, barcelona, georgia, freiburg, im, breisgau, and, several, other, places, in, order, to, avoid, this, confusion, the, protected, symbol, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, greek, red, cross, that, term, is, also, used, in, united, states, law, to, describe, the, red, cross, the, red, cross, of, the, saint, george, cross, extends, to, the, edge, of, the, flag, whereas, the, red, cross, on, the, red, cross, flag, does, not, the, red, cross, flag, is, the, colour, switched, version, of, the, flag, of, switzerland, in, recognition, of, the, pioneering, work, of, swiss, citizens, in, establishing, internationally, recognized, standards, for, the, protection, of, wounded, combatants, and, military, medical, facilities, in, 1906, to, put, an, end, to, the, argument, of, the, ottoman, empire, that, the, flag, took, its, roots, from, christianity, it, was, decided, officially, to, promote, the, idea, that, the, red, cross, flag, had, been, formed, by, reversing, the, federal, colours, of, switzerland, although, no, written, evidence, of, this, origin, had, ever, been, found, the, 1899, convention, signed, at, the, hague, extended, the, use, of, the, red, cross, flag, to, naval, ensigns, requiring, that, all, hospital, ships, shall, make, themselves, known, by, hoisting, together, with, their, national, flag, the, white, flag, with, a, red, cross, provided, by, the, geneva, convention, the, red, crescent, emblem, was, first, used, by, icrc, volunteers, during, the, armed, conflict, of, 1876, 1878, between, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, russian, empire, the, symbol, was, officially, adopted, in, 1929, and, so, far, 33, states, in, the, muslim, world, have, recognized, it, in, common, with, the, official, promotion, of, the, red, cross, symbol, as, a, colour, reversal, of, the, swiss, flag, rather, than, a, religious, symbol, the, red, crescent, is, similarly, presented, as, being, derived, from, a, colour, reversal, of, the, flag, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, icrc, was, concerned, with, the, possibility, that, the, two, previous, symbols, red, cross, and, red, crescent, were, conveying, religious, meanings, which, would, not, be, compatible, with, for, example, a, majority, hindu, or, buddhist, country, from, the, asia, pacific, region, where, the, majority, did, not, associate, with, these, symbols, therefore, in, 1992, the, then, president, cornelio, sommaruga, decided, that, a, third, more, neutral, symbol, was, required, on, 8, december, 2005, in, response, to, growing, pressure, to, accommodate, magen, david, adom, mda, israel, s, national, emergency, medical, disaster, ambulance, and, blood, bank, service, as, a, full, member, of, the, red, cross, and, red, crescent, movement, a, new, emblem, officially, the, third, protocol, emblem, but, more, commonly, known, as, the, red, crystal, was, adopted, by, an, amendment, of, the, geneva, conventions, known, as, protocol, iii, fulfilling, sommaruga, s, suggestion, the, crystal, can, be, found, on, official, buildings, and, occasionally, in, the, field, this, symbolises, equality, and, has, no, political, religious, or, geographical, connotations, thus, allowing, any, country, not, comfortable, with, the, symbolism, of, the, original, two, flags, to, join, the, movement, the, red, lion, and, sun, society, of, iran, was, established, in, 1922, and, admitted, to, the, red, cross, and, red, crescent, movement, in, 1923, the, symbol, was, introduced, at, geneva, in, 1864, as, a, counter, example, to, the, crescent, and, cross, used, by, two, of, iran, s, rivals, the, ottoman, and, the, russian, empires, although, that, claim, is, inconsistent, with, the, red, crescent, s, history, that, history, also, suggests, that, the, red, lion, and, sun, like, the, red, crescent, may, have, been, conceived, during, the, 1877, 1878, war, between, russia, and, turkey, due, to, the, emblem, s, association, with, the, iranian, monarchy, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, replaced, the, red, lion, and, sun, with, the, red, crescent, in, 1980, consistent, with, two, existing, red, cross, and, red, crescent, symbols, although, the, red, lion, and, sun, has, now, fallen, into, disuse, iran, has, in, the, past, reserved, the, right, to, take, it, up, again, at, any, time, the, geneva, conventions, continue, to, recognize, it, as, an, official, emblem, and, that, status, was, confirmed, by, protocol, iii, in, 2005, even, as, it, added, the, red, crystal, for, over, 50, years, the, state, of, israel, requested, the, addition, of, a, red, star, of, david, arguing, that, since, christian, and, muslim, emblems, were, recognized, the, corresponding, jewish, emblem, should, be, as, well, despite, the, red, cross, and, red, crescent, symbols, being, used, outside, of, a, religious, context, this, emblem, has, been, used, by, magen, david, adom, mda, or, red, star, of, david, but, it, is, not, recognized, by, the, geneva, conventions, as, a, protected, symbol, the, red, star, of, david, is, not, recognized, as, a, protected, symbol, outside, israel, instead, the, mda, uses, the, red, crystal, emblem, during, international, operations, in, order, to, ensure, protection, depending, on, the, circumstances, it, may, place, the, red, star, of, david, inside, the, red, crystal, or, use, the, red, crystal, alone, in, her, march, 2000, letter, to, the, international, herald, tribune, and, the, new, york, times, bernadine, healy, then, president, of, the, american, red, cross, wrote, the, international, committee, s, feared, proliferation, of, symbols, is, a, pitiful, fig, leaf, used, for, decades, as, the, reason, for, excluding, the, magen, david, adom, the, shield, or, star, of, david, in, protest, the, american, red, cross, withheld, millions, in, administrative, funding, to, the, international, federation, of, red, cross, and, red, crescent, societies, since, may, 2000, in, 1922, a, red, swastika, society, was, formed, in, china, during, the, warlord, era, the, swastika, is, used, in, the, indian, subcontinent, east, and, southeast, asia, as, a, symbol, to, represent, dharma, or, hinduism, buddhism, and, jainism, in, general, while, the, organization, has, organized, philanthropic, relief, projects, both, domestic, and, international,

naturv, lker, released, a, documentary, called, blood, on, the, cross, in, 1999, it, alleged, the, involvement, of, the, red, cross, with, the, british, and, indonesian, military, in, a, massacre, in, the, southern, highlands, of, western, new, guinea, during, the, world, wildlife, fund, s, mapenduma, hostage, crisis, of, may, 1996, when, western, and, indonesian, activists, were, held, hostage, by, separatists, following, the, broadcast, of, the, documentary, the, red, cross, announced, publicly, that, it, would, appoint, an, individual, outside, the, organization, to, investigate, the, allegations, made, in, the, film, and, any, responsibility, on, its, part, piotr, obuchowicz, was, appointed, to, investigate, the, matter, the, report, categorically, states, that, the, red, cross, personnel, accused, of, involvement, were, proven, not, to, have, been, present, that, a, white, helicopter, was, probably, used, in, a, military, operation, but, the, helicopter, was, not, a, red, cross, helicopter, and, must, have, been, painted, by, one, of, several, military, organizations, operating, in, the, region, at, the, time, perhaps, the, red, cross, logo, itself, was, also, used, although, no, hard, evidence, was, found, for, this, that, this, was, part, of, the, military, operation, to, free, the, hostages, but, was, clearly, intended, to, achieve, surprise, by, deceiving, the, local, people, into, thinking, that, a, red, cross, helicopter, was, landing, and, that, the, red, cross, should, have, responded, more, quickly, and, thoroughly, to, investigate, the,
