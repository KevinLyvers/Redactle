peterson, institute, for, international, economics, there, exists, disputes, over, reliability, of, official, economic, data, foreign, and, some, chinese, sources, have, claimed, that, official, chinese, government, statistics, overstate, china, s, economic, growth, however, several, western, academics, and, institutions, have, stated, that, china, s, economic, growth, is, higher, than, indicated, by, official, figures, others, such, as, the, economist, intelligence, unit, state, that, while, there, s, evidence, china, s, gdp, data, is, smoothed, they, believe, that, china, s, nominal, and, real, gdp, data, are, broadly, accurate, still, others, state, that, reported, gdp, growth, is, irreconcilable, with, data, coming, out, of, china, in, 2024, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, stopped, relying, on, official, chinese, government, data, over, reliability, concerns, according, to, 2007, documents, obtained, by, wikileaks, liaoning, party, secretary, and, future, premier, li, keqiang, said, he, is, far, from, confident, in, the, country, s, gdp, estimates, calling, them, man, made, and, unreliable, and, that, data, releases, especially, the, gdp, numbers, should, be, used, for, reference, only, in, its, place, he, developed, the, li, keqiang, index, is, an, alternative, measurement, of, chinese, economic, performance, that, uses, three, variables, he, preferred, chinese, provinces, and, cities, have, long, been, suspected, of, cooking, their, numbers, with, the, focus, on, local, government, officials, whose, performance, are, often, assessed, based, on, how, well, their, respective, economies, have, performed, local, governments, have, come, under, increased, scrutiny, over, the, last, few, years, over, economic, data, with, ccp, general, secretary, xi, jinping, stating, that, economic, data, forgery, not, only, hurt, our, judgment, of, the, economic, situation, but, also, seriously, undermined, the, communist, party, s, ideas, and, truth, seeking, style, according, to, a, 2019, research, paper, published, by, the, brookings, institution, adjusting, the, historical, gdp, time, series, using, value, added, tax, data, which, the, authors, said, are, highly, resistant, to, fraud, and, tampering, china, s, economic, growth, may, have, been, overstated, by, 1, 7, percent, each, year, between, 2008, and, 2016, meaning, that, the, government, may, have, been, overstating, the, size, of, the, chinese, economy, by, 12, 16, percent, in, 2016, several, western, academics, and, institutions, have, supported, the, claim, that, china, s, economy, is, likely, to, be, underestimated, a, paper, by, the, us, based, national, bureau, of, economic, research, claimed, that, china, s, economic, growth, may, be, higher, than, what, is, reported, by, official, statistics, an, article, by, hunter, clarka, maxim, pinkovskiya, and, xavier, sala, i, martin, published, by, the, elsevier, science, direct, in, 2018, employs, an, innovative, method, of, satellite, recorded, nighttime, lights, which, the, authors, claim, to, be, a, best, unbiased, predictor, of, the, economic, growth, in, chinese, cities, the, results, suggest, that, the, chinese, economic, growth, rate, is, higher, than, the, official, reported, data, satellite, measurements, of, light, pollution, are, used, by, some, analysts, to, model, chinese, economic, growth, and, suggest, growth, rate, numbers, in, chinese, official, data, are, more, reliable, though, are, likely, to, be, smoothed, according, to, an, article, by, the, federal, reserve, bank, of, st, louis, china, s, official, statistics, are, of, a, high, quality, compared, to, other, developing, middle, income, and, low, income, countries, in, 2016, china, was, at, the, 83rd, percentile, of, middle, and, low, income, countries, up, from, the, 38th, percentile, in, 2004, a, study, by, the, federal, reserve, bank, of, san, francisco, found, that, china, s, official, gdp, statistics, are, significantly, and, positively, correlated, with, externally, verifiable, measures, of, economic, activity, such, as, import, and, export, data, from, china, s, trade, partners, suggesting, that, china, s, economic, growth, was, no, slower, than, the, official, figures, indicated, the, study, by, daniel, h, rosen, and, beibei, bao, published, by, the, center, for, strategic, and, international, studies, in, 2015, showed, that, gdp, in, 2008, was, actually, 13, 16, percent, bigger, than, the, official, data, while, 2013, gdp, was, accurately, at, 10, 5, trillion, rather, than, the, official, figure, at, 9, 5, trillion, according, to, a, research, conducted, by, arvind, subramanian, a, former, economist, at, the, international, money, fund, imf, and, a, senior, fellow, at, the, peterson, institute, for, international, economics, the, size, of, the, chinese, economy, by, purchasing, power, parity, in, 2010, was, about, 14, 8, trillion, rather, than, an, official, estimate, at, 10, 1, trillion, by, imf, meaning, that, china, s, gdp, was, underestimated, by, 47, percent, in, 2022, china, s, total, government, debt, stood, at, approximately, cn, 94, trillion, us, 14, trillion, equivalent, to, about, 77, 1, of, gdp, in, 2014, many, analysts, expressed, concern, over, the, overall, size, of, china, s, government, debt, at, the, end, of, 2014, the, international, monetary, fund, reported, that, china, s, general, government, gross, debt, to, gdp, ratio, was, 41, 44, percent, in, 2015, a, report, by, the, international, monetary, fund, concluded, that, china, s, public, debt, is, relatively, low, and, on, a, stable, path, in, all, standard, stress, tests, except, for, the, scenario, with, contingent, liability, shocks, such, as, a, large, scale, bank, recapitalization, or, financial, system, bailout, to, deal, for, example, with, a, potential, rise, in, npls, from, deleveraging, chinese, authorities, have, dismissed, analysts, worries, insisting, the, country, still, has, room, to, increase, government, debt, former, fed, chairman, ben, bernanke, earlier, in, 2016, commented, that, the, debt, pile, facing, china, an, internal, problem, given, the, majority, of, the, borrowings, was, issued, in, local, currency, a, 2019, survey, by, the, oecd, found, that, china, s, corporate, debt, is, higher, than, other, major, countries, shadow, banking, has, risen, in, china, posing, risks, to, the, financial, system, off, the, books, debt, is, a, grey, area, but, estimates, place, the, amount, for, local, governments, alone, as, high, as, 9, trillion, or, 63, trillion, yuan, up, from, estimates, of, around, 30, trillion, yuan, in, 2020, though, china, s, economy, has, expanded, rapidly, its, regulatory, environment, has, not, kept, pace, since, deng, xiaoping, s, open, market, reforms, the, growth, of, new, businesses, has, outpaced, the, government, s, ability, to, regulate, them, this, has, created, a, situation, where, businesses, faced, with, mounting, competition, and, poor, oversight, take, drastic, measures, to, increase, profit, margins, often, at, the, expense, of, consumer, safety, this, issue, became, more, prominent, in, 2007, with, a, number, of, restrictions, being, placed, on, problematic, chinese, exports, by, the, united, states, the, chinese, technology, sector, has, been, characterized, as, being, dominated, by, few, larger, entities, including, ant, group, and, tencent, there, have, been, attempts, by, the, xi, jinping, administration, to, enforce,

the, 2020, 2021, xi, jinping, administration, reform, spree, were, followed, with, calls, by, the, politburo, against, monopolistic, practices, by, commercial, retail, giants, like, alibaba, in, march, 2021, xi, stated, china, would, strengthen, its, antitrust, enforcement, in, an, effort, to, advance, what, he, described, as, the, healthy, and, sustainable, development, of, the, platform,

investment, is, carried, out, by, entities, that, are, at, least, partially, state, owned, most, of, these, are, under, the, control, of, local, governments, thus, booms, are, primarily, the, result, of, perverse, incentives, at, the, local, government, level, unlike, entrepreneurs, in, a, free, enterprise, economy, chinese, local, officials, are, motivated, primarily, by, political, considerations, as, their, performance, evaluations, are, based, to, a, large, extent, on, gdp, growth, within, their, jurisdictions, they, have, a, strong, incentive, to, promote, large, scale,

both, through, state, sector, entities, they, control, directly, and, by, offering, investment, promotion, incentives, to, private, investors, and, enterprises, outside, their, jurisdictions, the, resulting, boom, puts, upward, pressure, on, prices, and, may, also, result, in, shortages, of, key, inputs, such, as, coal, and, electricity, as, was, the, case, in, 2003, once, inflation, has,

are, one, of, the, few, ways, in, which, it, is, comparatively, easy, to, grow, and, preserve, wealth, due, to, this, many, economists, have, speculated, about, a, property, bubble, within, the,

immense, hydroelectric, potential, but, the, industrialized, regions, around, guangzhou, and, the, lower, yangtze, region, around, shanghai, have, too, little, energy, while, there, is, relatively, little, heavy, industry, located, near, major, energy, resource, areas, other, than, in, the, southern, part, of, the, northeast, due, in, large, part, to, environmental, concerns, china, has, wanted, to, shift, china, s, current, energy, mix, from, a, heavy, reliance, on, coal, which, accounts, for, 70, 75, of, china, s, energy, toward, greater, reliance, on, oil, natural, gas, renewable, energy, and, nuclear, power, china, has, closed, thousands, of, coal, mines, over, the, past, five, to, ten, years, to, cut, overproduction, according, to, chinese, statistics, this, has, reduced, coal,

but, projections, continued, to, show, a, dramatic, rise, in, carbon, emissions, from, burning, fossil, fuels, while, not, the, largest, source, of, historical, cumulative, emissions, today, china, accounts, for, one, quarter, of, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, on, a, per, capita, basis, china, s, emissions, in, 2019, 9, tonnes, co, 2, equivalent, per, year, surpass, those, of, the,

long, term, socioeconomic, cost, of, environmental, pollution, in, china, it, has, been, suggested, by, nicholas, stern, and, fergus, green, of, the, grantham, research, institute, on, climate, change, and, the, environment, that, the, economy, of, china, be, shifted, to, more, advanced, industrial, development, with, low, carbon, dioxide, emissions, and, better, allocation, of, national, resources, to, innovation, and, r, d, for, sustainable, economic, growth, in, order, to, reduce, the, impact, of, china, s, heavy, industry, this, is, in, accord, with, the, planning, goals, of, the, central, government, contrary, to, the, publicized, goals, china, is, building, a, large, number, of, coal, fired, power, plants, and, it, carbon, emissions, could, further, increase, china, s, mineral, resources, are, diverse, and, rich, as, of, at, least, 2022, more, than, 200, types, of, minerals, are, actively, explored, or, mined, in, china, these, resources, are, widely, but, not, evenly, distributed, throughout, the, country, taken, as, a, whole, china, s, economy, and, exports, do, not, rely, on, the, mining, industry, but, the, industry, is, critical, to, various, subnational, chinese, governments, mining, is, extensively, regulated, in, china, and, involves, numerous, regulatory, bodies, the, chinese, state, owns, all, mineral, rights, regardless, of, the, ownership, of, the, land, on, which, the, minerals, are, located, mining, rights, can, be, obtained, upon, government, approval, and, payment, of, mining, and, prospecting, fees, china, has, an, abundant, potential, for, hydroelectric, power, production, due, to, its, considerable, river, network, and, mountainous, terrain, most, of, the, total, hydroelectric, capacity, is, situated, in, the, southwest, of, the, country, where, coal, supplies, are, poor, but, demand, for, energy, is, rising, swiftly, the, potential, in, the, northeast, is, fairly, small, but, it, was, there, that, the, first, hydroelectric, stations, were, built, by, the, japanese, during, its, occupation, of, manchuria, thirteen, years, in, construction, at, a, cost, of, 24, billion, the, immense, three, gorges, dam, across, the, yangtze, river, was, essentially, completed, in, 2006, and, produced, more, than, 100twh, of, energy, in, 2018, china, is, well, endowed, with, mineral, resources, the, most, important, of, which, is, coal, china, s, mineral, resources, include, large, reserves, of, coal, and, iron, ore, plus, adequate, to, abundant, supplies, of, nearly, all, other, industrial, minerals, although, coal, deposits, are, widely, scattered, some, coal, is, found, in, every, province, most, of, the, total, is, located, in, the, northern, part, of, the, country, the, province, of, shanxi, in, fact, is, thought, to, contain, about, half, of, the, total, other, important, coal, bearing, provinces, include, heilongjiang, liaoning, jilin, hebei, and, shandong, apart, from, these, northern, provinces, significant, quantities, of, coal, are, present, in, sichuan, and, there, are, some, deposits, of, importance, in, guangdong, guangxi, yunnan, and, guizhou, a, large, part, of, the, country, s, reserves, consists, of, good, bituminous, coal, but, there, are, also, large, deposits, of, lignite, anthracite, is, present, in, several, places, especially, liaoning, guizhou, and, henan, but, overall, it, is, not, very, significant, to, ensure, a, more, even, distribution, of, coal, supplies, and, to, reduce, the, strain, on, the, less, than, adequate, transportation, network, the, authorities, pressed, for, the, development, of, a, large, number, of, small, locally, run, mines, throughout, the, country, this, campaign, was, energetically, pursued, after, the, 1960s, with, the, result, that, thousands, of, small, pits, have, been, established, and, they, produce, more, than, half, the, country, s, coal, this, output, however, is, typically, expensive, and, is, used, for, local, consumption, it, has, also, led, to, a, less, than, stringent, implementation, of, safety, measures, in, these, unregulated, mines, which, cause, several, thousands, of, deaths, each, year, coal, makes, up, the, bulk, of, china, s, energy, consumption, 70, in, 2005, 55, in, 2021, and, china, is, the, largest, producer, and, consumer, of, coal, in, the, world, as, china, s, economy, continues, to, grow, china, s, coal, demand, is, projected, to, rise, significantly, although, coal, s, share, of, china, s, overall, energy, consumption, will, decrease, coal, consumption, will, continue, to, rise, in, absolute, terms, china, s, continued, and, increasing, reliance, on, coal, as, a, power, source, has, contributed, significantly, to, putting, china, on, the, path, to, becoming, the, world, s, largest, emitter, of, acid, rain, causing, sulfur, dioxide, and, greenhouse, gases, including, carbon, dioxide, china, s, onshore, oil, resources, are, mostly, located, in, the, northeast, and, in, xinjiang, gansu, qinghai, sichuan, shandong, and, henan, provinces, oil, shale, is, found, in, a, number, of, places, especially, at, fushun, in, liaoning, where, the, deposits, overlie, the, coal, reserves, as, well, as, in, guangdong, high, quality, light, oil, has, been, found, in, the, pearl, river, estuary, of, the, south, china, sea, the, qaidam, basin, in, qinghai, and, the, tarim, basin, in, xinjiang, the, country, consumes, most, of, its, oil, output, but, does, export, some, crude, oil, and, oil, products, china, has, explored, and, developed, oil, deposits, in, the, south, china, sea, and, east, china, sea, the, yellow, sea, the, gulf, of, tonkin, and, the, bohai, sea, in, 2013, the, pace, of, china, s, economic, growth, exceeded, the, domestic, oil, capacity, and, floods, damaged, the, nation, s, oil, fields, in, the, middle, of, the, year, consequently, china, imported, oil, to, compensate, for, the, supply, reduction, and, surpassed, the, us, in, september, 2013, to, become, the, world, s, largest, importer, of, oil, the, total, extent, of, china, s, natural, gas, reserves, is, unknown, as, relatively, little, exploration, for, natural, gas, has, been, done, sichuan, accounts, for, almost, half, of, the, known, natural, gas, reserves, and, production, most, of, the, rest, of, china, s, natural, gas, is, associated, gas, produced, in, the, northeast, s, major, oil, fields, especially, daqing, oilfield, other, gas, deposits, have, been, found, in, the, qaidam, basin, hebei, jiangsu, shanghai, and, zhejiang, and, offshore, to, the, southwest, of, hainan, according, to, an, article, published, in, energy, economics, in, 2011, by, economists, mete, feridun, university, of, greenwich, and, abdul, jalil, wuhan, university, in, china, financial, development, in, china, has, not, taken, place, at, the, expense, of, environmental, pollution, and, financial, development, has, led, to, a, decrease, in, environmental, pollution, authors, conclude, that, carbon, emissions, are, mainly, determined, by, income, energy, consumption, and, trade, openness, and, their, findings, confirm, the, existence, of, an, environmental, kuznets, curve, in, the, case, of, china, iron, ore, reserves, are, found, in, most, provinces, including, hainan, gansu, guizhou, southern, sichuan, and, guangdong, provinces, have, rich, deposits, the, largest, mined, reserves, are, located, north, of, the, yangtze, river, and, supply, neighboring, iron, and, steel, enterprises, with, the, exception, of, nickel, chromium, and, cobalt, china, is, well, supplied, with, ferroalloys, and, manganese, reserves, of, tungsten, are, also, known, to, be, fairly, large, copper, resources, are, moderate, and, high, quality, ore, is, present, only, in, a, few, deposits, discoveries, have, been, reported, from, ningxia, lead, and, zinc, are, available, and, bauxite, resources, are, thought, to, be, plentiful, china, s, antimony, reserves, are, the, largest, in, the, world, tin, resources, are, plentiful, and, there, are, fairly, rich, deposits, of, gold, china, is, the, world, s, fifth, largest, producer, of, gold, and, in, the, early, 21st, century, became, an, important, producer, and, exporter, of, rare, metals, needed, in, high, technology, industries, china, also, produces, a, fairly, wide, range, of, nonmetallic, minerals, one, of, the, most, important, of, these, is, salt, which, is, derived, from, coastal, evaporation, sites, in, jiangsu, hebei, shandong, and, liaoning, as, well, as, from, extensive, salt, fields, in, sichuan, ningxia, and, the, qaidam, basin, there, are, important, deposits, of, phosphate, rock, in, a, number, of, areas, jiangxi, guangxi, yunnan, and, hubei, production, has, been, accelerating, every, year, as, of, 2013, china, is, producing, 97, 000, 000, metric, tons, of, phosphate, rock, a, year, pyrites, occur, in, several, places, liaoning, hebei, shandong, and, shanxi, have, the, most, important, deposits, china, also, has, large, resources, of, fluorite, fluorspar, gypsum, asbestos, and, has, the, world, s, largest, reserves, and, production, of, cement, clinker, and, limestone, china, has, a, strong, global, position, in, the, production, of, industrial, goods, and, some, of, its, companies, are, global, leader, in, the, areas, of, steel, solar, energy, and, telecommunications, accessories, 131, as, of, 2023, industry, accounts, for, 38, 3, of, china, s, gdp, from, 2010, until, at, least, 2023, china, produces, more, industrial, goods, than, any, other, country, 1, as, of, 2023, china, manufactures, approximately, one, fifth, of, the, world, s, total, output, of, industrial, products, 133, major, industries, include, mining, and, ore, processing, iron, and, steel, aluminium, coal, machinery, armaments, textiles, and, apparel, petroleum, cement, chemical, fertilizers, food, processing, automobiles, and, other, transportation, equipment, including, rail, cars, and, locomotives, ships, and, aircraft, consumer, products, including, footwear, toys, and, electronics, telecommunications, and, information, technology, since, the, founding, of, the, people, s, republic, industrial, development, has, been, given, considerable, attention, as, of, 2011, 46, of, china, s, national, output, continued, to, be, devoted, to, investment, a, percentage, far, higher, than, any, other, nation, among, the, various, industrial, branches, the, machine, building, and, metallurgical, industries, have, received, the, highest, priority, these, two, areas, alone, now, account, for, about, 20, 30, percent, of, the, total, gross, value, of, industrial, output, in, these, as, in, most, other, areas, of, industry, however, innovation, has, generally, suffered, at, the, hands, of, a, system, that, has, rewarded, increases, in, gross, output, rather, than, improvements, in, variety, sophistication, and, quality, china, therefore, still, imports, significant, quantities, of, specialized, steels, overall, industrial, output, has, grown, at, an, average, rate, of, more, than, ten, percent, per, year, having, surpassed, all, other, sectors, in, economic, growth, and, degree, of, modernization, the, predominant, focus, of, development, in, the, chemical, industry, is, to, expand, the, output, of, chemical, fertilizers, plastics, and, synthetic, fibers, the, growth, of, this, industry, has, placed, china, among, the, world, s, leading, producers, of, nitrogenous, fertilizers, in, the, consumer, goods, sector, the, main, emphasis, is, on, textiles, and, clothing, which, also, form, an, important, part, of, china, s, exports, textile, manufacturing, a, rapidly, growing, proportion, of, which, consists, of, synthetics, account, for, about, ten, percent, of, the, gross, industrial, output, and, continues, to, be, important, but, less, so, than, before, the, industry, tends, to, be, scattered, throughout, the, country, but, there, are, a, number, of, important, textile, centers, including, shanghai, guangzhou, and, harbin, there, is, a, growing, consumer, culture, in, china, as, of, at, least, 2024, china, has, significant, industrial, capacity, in, excess, of, its, domestic, needs, 34, the, government, has, sought, to, alleviate, industrial, capacity, by, channeling, it, abroad, including, through, the, belt, and, road, initiative, 34, in, 2020, china, produced, over, 1053, million, tonnes, of, steel, over, half, of, the, world, total, this, was, an, increase, of, 5, 6, over, the, previous, year, as, global, steel, production, fell, by, 0, 9, china, s, share, of, global, crude, steel, production, increased, from, 53, 3, in, 2019, to, 56, 5, in, 2020, decreasing, 2, 1, in, 2021, iron, ore, production, kept, pace, with, steel, production, in, the, early, 1990s, but, was, soon, outpaced, by, imported, iron, ore, and, other, metals, in, the, early, 2000s, steel, production, an, estimated, 140, million, tons, in, 2000, increased, to, 419, million, tons, in, 2006, and, 928, million, tons, by, 2018, china, was, the, top, exporter, of, steel, in, the, world, in, 2018, export, volumes, in, 2018, were, 66, 9, million, tons, a, nine, percent, decrease, over, the, previous, year, it, again, decreased, in, 2021, to, 66, 2, million, tons, the, decline, slowed, china, s, decade, old, steel, export, growth, as, of, 2012, steel, exports, faced, widespread, anti, dumping, taxes, and, had, not, returned, to, pre, 2008, levels, domestic, demand, remained, strong,

working, women, eligible, for, retirement, at, 50, and, men, at, 60, 167, china, s, transportation, policy, influenced, by, political, military, and, economic, concerns, have, undergone, major, changes, since, 1949, immediately, after, the, people, s, republic, was, founded, the, primary, goal, was, to, repair, existing, transportation, infrastructure, in, order, to, meet, military, transport, and, logistics, needs, as, well, as, to, strengthen, territorial, integrity, during, most, of, the, 1950s, new, road, and, rail, links, were, built, while, at, the, same, time, old, ones, were, improved, during, the, 1960s, much, of, the, improvement, of, regional, transportation, became, the, responsibility, of, the, local, governments, and, many, small, railways, were, constructed, emphasis, was, also, placed, on, developing, transportation, in, remote, rural, mountainous, and, forested, areas, in, order, to, integrate, poorer, regions, of, the, country, and, to, help, promote, economies, of, scale, in, the, agricultural, sector, before, the, reform, era, began, in, the, late, 1970s, china, s, transportation, links, were, mostly, concentrated, in, the, coastal, areas, and, access, to, the, inner, regions, was, generally, poor, this, situation, has, been, improved, considerably, since, then, as, railways, and, highways, have, been, built, in, the, remote, and, frontier, regions, of, the, northwest, and, southwest, at, the, same, time, the, development, of, international, transportation, was, also, pursued, and, the, scope, of, ocean, shipping, was, broadened,

transportation, needs, some, economic, experts, have, argued, that, the, development, gap, between, china, and, other, emerging, economies, such, as, brazil, argentina, and, india, can, be, attributed, to, a, large, extent, to, china, s, early, focus, on, ambitious, infrastructure, projects, while, china, invested, roughly, 9, of, its, gdp, on, infrastructure, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, most, emerging, economies, invested, only, 2, to, 5, of, their, gdp, this, considerable, spending, gap, allowed, the, chinese, economy, to, grow, at, near, optimal, conditions, while, many, south, american, economies, suffered, from, various, development, bottlenecks, such, as, poor, transportation, networks, aging, power, grids, and, mediocre, schools, science, and, technology, in, china, has,
