and, in, romania, although, italian, is, neither, a, co, official, nor, a, protected, language, in, these, countries, some, speakers, of, italian, are, native, bilinguals, of, both, italian, either, in, its, standard, form, or, regional, varieties, and, a, local, language, of, italy, most, frequently, the, language, spoken, at, home, in, their, place, of, origin, italian, is, a, major, language, in, europe, being, one, of, the, official, languages, of, the, organization, for, security, and, co, operation, in, europe, and, one, of, the, working, languages, of, the, council, of, europe, it, is, the, third, most, widely, spoken, native, language, in, the, european, union, 13, of, the, eu, population, and, it, is, spoken, as, a, second, language, by, 13, 4, million, eu, citizens, 3, including, italian, speakers, in, non, eu, european, countries, such, as, switzerland, albania, and, the, united, kingdom, and, on, other, continents, the, total, number, of, speakers, is, approximately, 85, million, italian, is, the, main, working, language, of, the, holy, see, serving, as, the, lingua, franca, common, language, in, the, roman, catholic, hierarchy, as, well, as, the, official, language, of, the, sovereign, military, order, of, malta, italian, has, a, significant, use, in, musical, terminology, and, opera, with, numerous, italian, words, referring, to, music, that, have, become, international, terms, taken, into, various, languages, worldwide, almost, all, native, italian, words, end, with, vowels, and, the, language, has, a, 7, vowel, sound, system, e, and, o, have, mid, low, and, mid, high, sounds, italian, has, contrast, between, short, and, long, consonants, and, gemination, doubling, of, consonants, during, the, middle, ages, the, established, written, language, in, europe, was, latin, though, the, great, majority, of, people, were, illiterate, and, only, few, were, well, versed, in, the, language, in, the, italian, peninsula, as, in, most, of, europe, most, would, instead, speak, a, local, vernacular, these, dialects, as, they, are, commonly, referred, to, evolved, from, vulgar, latin, over, the, course, of, centuries, unaffected, by, formal, standards, and, teachings, they, are, not, in, any, sense, dialects, of, standard, italian, which, itself, started, off, as, one, of, these, local, tongues, but, sister, languages, of, italian, mutual, intelligibility, with, italian, varies, widely, as, it, does, with, romance, languages, in, general, the, romance, languages, of, italy, can, differ, greatly, from, italian, at, all, levels, phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon, pragmatics, and, are, classified, typologically, as, distinct, languages, the, standard, italian, language, has, a, poetic, and, literary, origin, in, the, works, of, tuscan, writers, of, the, 12th, century, and, even, though, the, grammar, and, core, lexicon, are, basically, unchanged, from, those, used, in, florence, in, the, 13th, century, the, modern, standard, of, the, language, was, largely, shaped, by, relatively, recent, events, however, romance, vernacular, as, language, spoken, in, the, italian, peninsula, has, a, longer, history, in, fact, the, earliest, surviving, texts, that, can, definitely, be, called, vernacular, as, distinct, from, its, predecessor, vulgar, latin, are, legal, formulae, known, as, the, placiti, cassinesi, from, the, province, of, benevento, that, date, from, 960, to, 963, although, the, veronese, riddle, probably, from, the, 8th, or, early, 9th, century, contains, a, late, form, of, vulgar, latin, that, can, be, seen, as, a, very, early, sample, of, a, vernacular, dialect, of, italy, the, commodilla, catacomb, inscription, is, also, a, similar, case, the, italian, language, has, progressed, through, a, long, and, slow, process, which, started, after, the, western, roman, empire, s, fall, in, the, 5th, century, the, language, that, came, to, be, thought, of, as, italian, developed, in, central, tuscany, and, was, first, formalized, in, the, early, 14th, century, through, the, works, of, tuscan, writer, dante, alighieri, written, in, his, native, florentine, dante, s, epic, poems, known, collectively, as, the, commedia, to, which, another, tuscan, poet, giovanni, boccaccio, later, affixed, the, title, divina, were, read, throughout, the, peninsula, and, his, written, dialect, became, the, canonical, standard, that, all, educated, italians, could, understand, dante, is, still, credited, with, standardizing, the, italian, language, in, addition, to, the, widespread, exposure, gained, through, literature, the, florentine, dialect, also, gained, prestige, due, to, the, political, and, cultural, significance, of, florence, at, the, time, and, the, fact, that, it, was, linguistically, an, intermediate, between, the, northern, and, the, southern, italian, dialects, 22, thus, the, dialect, of, florence, became, the, basis, for, what, would, become, the, official, language, of, italy, italian, was, progressively, made, an, official, language, of, most, of, the, italian, states, predating, unification, slowly, replacing, latin, even, when, ruled, by, foreign, powers, like, spain, in, the, kingdom, of, naples, or, austria, in, the, kingdom, of, lombardy, venetia, even, though, the, masses, kept, speaking, primarily, their, local, vernaculars, italian, was, also, one, of, the, many, recognised, languages, in, the, austro, hungarian, empire, italy, has, always, had, a, distinctive, dialect, for, each, city, because, the, cities, until, recently, were, thought, of, as, city, states, those, dialects, now, have, considerable, variety, as, tuscan, derived, italian, came, to, be, used, throughout, italy, features, of, local, speech, were, naturally, adopted, producing, various, versions, of, regional, italian, the, most, characteristic, differences, for, instance, between, roman, italian, and, milanese, italian, are, syntactic, gemination, of, initial, consonants, in, some, contexts, and, the, pronunciation, of, stressed, e, and, of, s, between, vowels, in, many, words, e, g, va, bene, all, right, is, pronounced, by, a, roman, and, by, any, standard, italian, speaker, by, a, milanese, and, by, any, speaker, whose, native, dialect, lies, to, the, north, of, the, la, spezia, rimini, line, a, casa, at, home, is, for, roman, or, for, standard, for, milanese, and, generally, northern, in, contrast, to, the, gallo, italic, linguistic, panorama, of, northern, italy, the, italo, dalmatian, neapolitan, and, its, related, dialects, were, largely, unaffected, by, the, franco, occitan, influences, introduced, to, italy, mainly, by, bards, from, france, during, the, middle, ages, but, after, the, norman, conquest, of, southern, italy, sicily, became, the, first, italian, land, to, adopt, occitan, lyric, moods, and, words, in, poetry, even, in, the, case, of, northern, italian, languages, however, scholars, are, careful, not, to, overstate, the, effects, of, outsiders, on, the, natural, indigenous, developments, of, the, languages, the, economic, might, and, relatively, advanced, development, of, tuscany, at, the, time, late, middle, ages, gave, its, language, weight, though, venetian, remained, widespread, in, medieval, italian, commercial, life, and, ligurian, or, genoese, remained, in, use, in, maritime, trade, alongside, the, mediterranean, the, increasing, political, and, cultural, relevance, of, florence, during, the, periods, of, the, rise, of, the, medici, bank, humanism, and, the, renaissance, made, its, dialect, or, rather, a, refined, version, of, it, a, standard, in, the, arts, the, renaissance, era, known, as, il, rinascimento, in, italian, was, seen, as, a, time, of, rebirth, which, is, the, literal, meaning, of, both, renaissance, from, french, and, rinascimento, italian, during, this, time, long, existing, beliefs, stemming, from, the, teachings, of, the, roman, catholic, church, began, to, be, understood, from, new, perspectives, as, humanists, individuals, who, placed, emphasis, on, the, human, body, and, its, full, potential, began, to, shift, focus, from, the, church, to, human, beings, themselves, the, continual, advancements, in, technology, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, diffusion, of, languages, after, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, in, the, fifteenth, century, the, number, of, printing, presses, in, italy, grew, rapidly, and, by, the, year, 1500, reached, a, total, of, 56, the, biggest, number, of, printing, presses, in, all, of, europe, this, enabled, the, production, of, more, pieces, of, literature, at, a, lower, cost, and, italian, as, the, dominant, language, spread, italian, became, the, language, used, in, the, courts, of, every, state, in, the, italian, peninsula, as, well, as, the, prestige, variety, used, on, the, island, of, corsica, but, not, in, the, neighbouring, sardinia, which, on, the, contrary, underwent, italianization, well, into, the, late, 18th, century, under, savoyard, sway, the, island, s, linguistic, composition, roofed, by, the, prestige, of, spanish, among, the, sardinians, would, therein, make, for, a, rather, slow, process, of, assimilation, to, the, italian, cultural, sphere, the, rediscovery, of, dante, s, de, vulgari, eloquentia, as, well, as, a, renewed, interest, in, linguistics, in, the, 16th, century, sparked, a, debate, that, raged, throughout, italy, concerning, the, criteria, that, should, govern, the, establishment, of, a, modern, italian, literary, and, spoken, language, this, discussion, known, as, questione, della, lingua, i, e, the, problem, of, the, language, ran, through, the, italian, culture, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, often, linked, to, the, political, debate, on, achieving, a, united, italian, state, renaissance, scholars, divided, into, three, main, factions, a, fourth, faction, claimed, that, the, best, italian, was, the, one, that, the, papal, court, adopted, which, was, a, mixture, of, the, tuscan, and, roman, dialects, eventually, bembo, s, ideas, prevailed, and, the, foundation, of, the, accademia, della, crusca, in, florence, 1582, 1583, the, official, legislative, body, of, the, italian, language, led, to, the, publication, of, agnolo, monosini, s, latin, tome, floris, italicae, linguae, libri, novem, in, 1604, followed, by, the, first, italian, dictionary, in, 1612, an, important, event, that, helped, the, diffusion, of, italian, was, the, conquest, and, occupation, of, italy, by, napoleon, in, the, early, 19th, century, who, was, himself, of, italian, corsican, descent, this, conquest, propelled, the, unification, of, italy, some, decades, after, and, pushed, the, italian, language, into, a, lingua, franca, used, not, only, among, clerks, nobility, and, functionaries, in, the, italian, courts, but, also, by, the, bourgeoisie, italian, literature, s, first, modern, novel, i, promessi, sposi, the, betrothed, by, alessandro, manzoni, further, defined, the, standard, by, rinsing, his, milanese, in, the, waters, of, the, arno, florence, s, river, as, he, states, in, the, preface, to, his, 1840, edition, after, unification, a, huge, number, of, civil, servants, and, soldiers, recruited, from, all, over, the, country, introduced, many, more, words, and, idioms, from, their, home, languages, ciao, is, derived, from, the, venetian, word, s, cia, o, slave, that, is, your, servant, panettone, comes, from, the, lombard, word, panetton, etc, only, 2, 5, of, italy, s, population, could, speak,

italian, is, based, on, tuscan, especially, its, florentine, dialect, and, is, therefore, an, italo, dalmatian, language, a, classification, that, includes, most, other, central, and, southern,

comparing, phonology, inflection, discourse, syntax, vocabulary, and, intonation, estimated, that, distance, between, italian, and, latin, is, higher, than, that, between, sardinian, and, latin, in,

everyone, still, speaks, the, corsican, idiom, which, due, to, its, linguistic, proximity, to, the, italian, standard, language, appears, both, linguistically, as, an, italian, dialect, and, therefore, as, a, carrier, of, italian, culture, despite, the, french, government, s, decades, long, efforts, to, cut, corsica, off, from, the, italian, motherland, italian, was, the, official,

second, most, common, modern, language, after, french, a, position, it, held, until, the, late, 18th, century, when, it, tended, to, be, replaced, by, german, john, milton, for, instance, wrote, some, of, his, early, poetry, in, italian, within, the, catholic, church, italian, is, known, by, a, large, part, of, the, ecclesiastical, hierarchy, and, is, used, in, substitution, for, latin, in, some, official, documents, italian, loanwords, continue, to, be, used, in, most, languages, in, matters, of, art, and, music, especially, classical, music, including, opera, in, the, design, and, fashion, industries, in, some, sports, like, football, and, especially, in, culinary, terms, in, italy, almost, all, the, other, languages, spoken, as, the, vernacular, other, than, standard, italian, and, some, languages, spoken, among, immigrant, communities, are, often, called, italian, dialects, a, label, that, can, be, very, misleading, if, it, is, understood, to, mean, dialects, of, italian, the, romance, dialects, of, italy, are, local, evolutions, of, spoken, latin, that, pre, date, the, establishment, of, italian, and, as, such, are, sister, languages, to, the, tuscan, that, was, the, historical, source, of, italian, they, can, be, quite, different, from, italian, and, from, each, other, with, some, belonging, to, different, linguistic, branches, of, romance, the, only, exceptions, to, this, are, twelve, groups, considered, historical, language, minorities, which, are, officially, recognized, as, distinct, minority, languages, by, the, law, on, the, other, hand, corsican, a, language, spoken, on, the, french, island, of, corsica, is, closely, related, to, medieval, tuscan, from, which, standard, italian, derives, and, evolved, the, differences, in, the, evolution, of, latin, in, the, different, regions, of, italy, can, be, attributed, to, the, natural, changes, that, all, languages, in, regular, use, are, subject, to, and, to, some, extent, to, the, presence, of, three, other, types, of, languages, substrata, superstrata, and, adstrata, the, most, prevalent, were, substrata, the, language, of, the, original, inhabitants, as, the, italian, dialects, were, most, likely, simply, latin, as, spoken, by, native, cultural, groups, superstrata, and, adstrata, were, both, less, important, foreign, conquerors, of, italy, that, dominated, different, regions, at, different, times, left, behind, little, to, no, influence, on, the, dialects, foreign, cultures, with, which, italy, engaged, in, peaceful, relations, with, such, as, trade, had, no, significant, influence, either, 19, 20, throughout, italy, regional, varieties, of, standard, italian, called, regional, italian, are, spoken, regional, differences, can, be, recognized, by, various, factors, the, openness, of, vowels, the, length, of, the, consonants, and, influence, of, the, local, language, for, example, in, informal, situations, and, ann, and, nare, replace, the, standard, italian, andare, in, the, area, of, tuscany, rome, and, venice, respectively, for, the, infinitive, to, go, there, is, no, definitive, date, when, the, various, italian, variants, of, latin, including, varieties, that, contributed, to, modern, standard, italian, began, to, be, distinct, enough, from, latin, to, be, considered, separate, languages, one, criterion, for, determining, that, two, language, variants, are, to, be, considered, separate, languages, rather, than, variants, of, a, single, language, is, that, they, have, evolved, so, that, they, are, no, longer, mutually, intelligible, this, diagnostic, is, effective, if, mutual, intelligibility, is, minimal, or, absent, e, g, in, romance, romanian, and, portuguese, but, it, fails, in, cases, such, as, spanish, portuguese, or, spanish, italian, as, educated, native, speakers, of, either, pairing, can, understand, each, other, well, if, they, choose, to, do, so, however, the, level, of, intelligibility, is, markedly, lower, between, italian, spanish, and, considerably, higher, between, the, iberian, sister, languages, of, portuguese, spanish, speakers, of, this, latter, pair, can, communicate, with, one, another, with, remarkable, ease, each, speaking, to, the, other, in, his, own, native, language, without, slang, jargon, nevertheless, on, the, basis, of, accumulated, differences, in, morphology, syntax, phonology, and, to, some, extent, lexicon, it, is, not, difficult, to, identify, that, for, the, romance, varieties, of, italy, the, first, extant, written, evidence, of, languages, that, can, no, longer, be, considered, latin, comes, from, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, c, e, these, written, sources, demonstrate, certain, vernacular, characteristics, and, sometimes, explicitly, mention, the, use, of, the, vernacular, in, italy, full, literary, manifestations, of, the, vernacular, began, to, surface, around, the, 13th, century, in, the, form, of, various, religious, texts, and, poetry, 21, although, these, are, the, first, written, records, of, italian, varieties, separate, from, latin, the, spoken, language, had, likely, diverged, long, before, the, first, written, records, appeared, since, those, who, were, literate, generally, wrote, in, latin, even, if, they, spoke, other, romance, varieties, in, person, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, use, of, standard, italian, became, increasingly, widespread, and, was, mirrored, by, a, decline, in, the, use, of, the, dialects, an, increase, in, literacy, was, one, of, the, main, driving, factors, one, can, assume, that, only, literates, were, capable, of, learning, standard, italian, whereas, those, who, were, illiterate, had, access, only, to, their, native, dialect, the, percentage, of, literates, rose, from, 25, in, 1861, to, 60, in, 1911, and, then, on, to, 78, 1, in, 1951, tullio, de, mauro, an, italian, linguist, has, asserted, that, in, 1861, only, 2, 5, of, the, population, of, italy, could, speak, standard, italian, he, reports, that, in, 1951, that, percentage, had, risen, to, 87, the, ability, to, speak, italian, did, not, necessarily, mean, it, was, in, everyday, use, and, most, people, 63, 5, still, usually, spoke, their, native, dialects, in, addition, other, factors, such, as, mass, emigration, industrialization, and, urbanization, and, internal, migrations, after, world, war, ii, contributed, to, the, proliferation, of, standard, italian, the, italians, who, emigrated, during, the, italian, diaspora, beginning, in, 1861, were, often, of, the, uneducated, lower, class, and, thus, the, emigration, had, the, effect, of, increasing, the, percentage, of, literates, who, often, knew, and, understood, the, importance, of, standard, italian, back, home, in, italy, a, large, percentage, of, those, who, had, emigrated, also, eventually, returned, to, italy, often, more, educated, than, when, they, had, left, 35, although, use, of, the, italian, dialects, has, declined, in, the, modern, era, as, italy, unified, under, standard, italian, and, continues, to, do, so, aided, by, mass, media, from, newspapers, to, radio, to, television, diglossia, is, still, frequently, encountered, in, italy, and, triglossia, is, not, uncommon, in, emigrant, communities, among, older, speakers, both, situations, normally, involve, some, degree, of, code, switching, and, code, mixing, notes, italian, has, a, seven, vowel, system, consisting, of, a, e, i, o, u, as, well, as, 23, consonants, compared, with, most, other, romance, languages, italian, phonology, is, conservative, preserving, many, words, nearly, unchanged, from, vulgar, latin, some, examples, the, conservative, nature, of, italian, phonology, is, partly, explained, by, its, origin, italian, stems, from, a, literary, language, that, is, derived, from, the, 13th, century, speech, of, the, city, of, florence, in, the, region, of, tuscany, and, has, changed, little, in, the, last, 700, years, or, so, furthermore, the, tuscan, dialect, is, the, most, conservative, of, all, italian, dialects, radically, different, from, the, gallo, italian, languages, less, than, 160, kilometres, 100, mi, to, the, north, across, the, la, spezia, rimini, line, the, following, are, some, of, the, conservative, phonological, features, of, italian, as, compared, with, the, common, western, romance, languages, french, spanish, portuguese, galician, catalan, some, of, these, features, are, also, present, in, romanian, compared, with, most, other, romance, languages, italian, has, many, inconsistent, outcomes, where, the, same, underlying, sound, produces, different, results, in, different, words, e, g, lax, re, lasciare, and, lassare, capti, re, cacciare, and, cazzare, ex, d, roteol, re, sdrucciolare, druzzolare, and, ruzzolare, r, g, na, regina, and, reina, although, in, all, these, examples, the, second, form, has, fallen, out, of, usage, the, dimorphism, is, thought, to, reflect, the, several, hundred, year, period, during, which, italian, developed, as, a, literary, language, divorced, from, any, native, speaking, population, with, an, origin, in, 12th, 13th, century, tuscan, but, with, many, words, borrowed, from, languages, farther, to, the, north, with, different, sound, outcomes, the, la, spezia, rimini, line, the, most, important, isogloss, in, the, entire, romance, language, area, passes, only, about, 30, kilometres, or, 20, miles, north, of, florence, dual, outcomes, of, latin, p, t, k, between, vowels, such, as, l, cvm, luogo, but, f, cvm, fuoco, was, once, thought, to, be, due, to, borrowing, of, northern, voiced, forms, but, is, now, generally, viewed, as, the, result, of, early, phonetic, variation, within, tuscany, some, other, features, that, distinguish, italian, from, the, western, romance, languages, standard, italian, also, differs, in, some, respects, from, most, nearby, italian, languages, italian, phonotactics, do, not, usually, permit, verbs, and, polysyllabic, nouns, to, end, with, consonants, except, in, poetry, and, song, so, foreign, words, may, receive, extra, terminal, vowel, sounds, italian, has, a, shallow, orthography, meaning, very, regular, spelling, with, an, almost, one, to, one, correspondence, between, letters, and, sounds, in, linguistic, terms, the, writing, system, is, close, to, being, a, phonemic, orthography, the, most, important, of, the, few, exceptions, are, the, following, see, below, for, more, details, the, italian, alphabet, is, typically, considered, to, consist, of, 21, letters, the, letters, j, k, w, x, y, are, traditionally, excluded, though, they, appear, in, loanwords, such, as, jeans, whisky, taxi, xenofobo, xilofono, the, letter, x, has, become, common, in, standard, italian, with, the, prefix, extra, although, e, stra, is, traditionally, used, it, is, also, common, to, use, the, latin, particle, ex, to, mean, former, ly, as, in, la, mia, ex, my, ex, girlfriend, ex, jugoslavia, former, yugoslavia, the, letter, j, appears, in, the, first, name, jacopo, and, in, some, italian, place, names, such, as, bajardo, bojano, joppolo, jerzu, jesolo, jesi, ajaccio, among, others, and, in, mar, jonio, an, alternative, spelling, of, mar, ionio, the, ionian, sea, the, letter, j, may, appear, in, dialectal, words, but, its, use, is, discouraged, in, contemporary, standard, italian, letters, used, in, foreign, words, can, be, replaced, with, phonetically, equivalent, native, italian, letters, and, digraphs, gi, ge, or, i, for, j, c, or, ch, for, k, including, in, the, standard, prefix, kilo, o, u, or, v, for, w, s, ss, z, zz, or, cs, for, x, and, e, or, i, for, y, italian, has, geminate, or, double, consonants, which, are, distinguished, by, length, and, intensity, length, is, distinctive, for, all, consonants, except, for, dz, ts, which, are, always, geminate, when, between, vowels, and, z, which, is, always, single, geminate, plosives, and, affricates, are, realized, as, lengthened, closures, geminate, fricatives, nasals, and, l, are, realized, as, lengthened, continuants, there, is, only, one, vibrant, phoneme, r, but, the, actual, pronunciation, depends, on, the, context, and, regional, accent, generally, one, can, find, a, flap, consonant, in, an, unstressed, position, whereas, is, more, common, in, stressed, syllables, but, there, may, be, exceptions, especially, people, from, the, northern, part, of, italy, parma, aosta, valley, south, tyrol, may, pronounce, r, as, or, of, special, interest, to, the, linguistic, study, of, regional, italian, is, the, gorgia, toscana, or, tuscan, throat, the, weakening, or, lenition, of, intervocalic, p, t, and, k, in, the, tuscan, language, the, voiced, postalveolar, fricative, is, present, as, a, phoneme, only, in, loanwords, for, example, garage, phonetic, is, common, in, central, and, southern, italy, as, an, intervocalic, allophone, of, d, gente, people, but, la, gente, the, people, ragione, reason, italian, grammar, is, typical, of, the, grammar, of, romance, languages, in, general, cases, exist, for, personal, pronouns, nominative, oblique, accusative, dative, but, not, for, nouns, there, are, two, basic, classes, of, nouns, in, italian, referred, to, as, genders, masculine, and, feminine, gender, may, be, natural, ragazzo, boy, ragazza, girl, or, simply, grammatical, with, no, possible, reference, to, biological, gender, masculine, costo, cost, feminine, costa, coast, masculine, nouns, typically, end, in, o, ragazzo, boy, with, plural, marked, by, i, ragazzi, boys, and, feminine, nouns, typically, end, in, a, with, plural, marked, by, e, ragazza, girl, ragazze, girls, for, a, group, composed, of, boys, and, girls, ragazzi, is, the, plural, suggesting, that, i, is, a, general, neutral, plural, a, third, category, of, nouns, is, unmarked, for, gender, ending, in, e, in, the, singular, and, i, in, the, plural, legge, law, f, sg, leggi, laws, f, pl, fiume, river, m, sg, fiumi, rivers, m, pl, thus, assignment, of, gender, is, arbitrary, in, terms, of, form, enough, so, that, terms, may, be, identical, but, of, distinct, genders, fine, meaning, aim, purpose, is, masculine, while, fine, meaning, end, ending, e, g, of, a, movie, is, feminine, and, both, are, fini, in, the, plural, a, clear, instance, of, i, as, a, non, gendered,

degrees, for, comparison, of, adjectives, positive, comparative, and, superlative, the, order, of, words, in, the, phrase, is, relatively, free, compared, to, most, european, languages, the, position,
