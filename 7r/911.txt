military, tactics, encompasses, the, art, of, organizing, and, employing, fighting, forces, on, or, near, the, battlefield, they, involve, the, application, of, four, battlefield, functions, which, are, closely, related, kinetic, or, firepower, mobility, protection, or, security, and, shock, action, tactics, are, a, separate, function, from, command, and, control, and, logistics, in, contemporary, military, science, tactics, are, the, lowest, of, three, levels, of, warfighting, the, higher, levels, being, the, strategic, and, operational, levels, throughout, history, there, has, been, a, shifting, balance, between, the, four, tactical, functions, generally, based, on, the, application, of, military, technology, which, has, led, to, one, or, more, of, the, tactical, functions, being, dominant, for, a, period, of, time, usually, accompanied, by, the, dominance, of, an, associated, fighting, arm, deployed, on, the, battlefield, such, as, infantry, artillery, cavalry, or, tanks, beginning, with, the, use, of, melee, and, missile, weapons, such, as, clubs, and, spears, the, kinetic, or, firepower, function, of, tactics, has, developed, along, with, technological, advances, so, that, the, emphasis, has, shifted, over, time, from, the, close, range, melee, and, missile, weapons, to, longer, range, projectile, weapons, kinetic, effects, were, generally, delivered, by, the, sword, spear, javelin, and, bow, until, the, introduction, of, artillery, by, the, romans, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, value, of, infantry, delivered, missile, firepower, was, not, high, meaning, that, the, result, of, a, given, battle, was, rarely, decided, by, infantry, firepower, alone, often, relying, on, artillery, to, deliver, significant, kinetic, effects, the, development, of, disciplined, volley, fire, delivered, at, close, range, began, to, improve, the, hitting, power, of, infantry, and, compensated, in, part, for, the, limited, range, poor, accuracy, and, low, rate, of, fire, of, early, muskets, advances, in, technology, particularly, the, introduction, of, the, rifled, musket, used, in, the, crimean, war, and, american, civil, war, meant, flatter, trajectories, and, improved, accuracy, at, greater, ranges, along, with, higher, casualties, the, resulting, increase, in, defensive, firepower, meant, infantry, attacks, without, artillery, support, became, increasingly, difficult, firepower, also, became, crucial, to, fixing, an, enemy, in, place, to, allow, a, decisive, strike, machine, guns, added, significantly, to, infantry, firepower, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, mobile, firepower, provided, by, tanks, self, propelled, artillery, and, military, aircraft, rose, significantly, in, the, century, that, followed, along, with, infantry, weapons, tanks, and, other, armoured, vehicles, self, propelled, artillery, guided, weapons, and, aircraft, provide, the, firepower, of, modern, armies, mobility, which, determines, how, quickly, a, fighting, force, can, move, was, for, most, of, human, history, limited, by, the, speed, of, a, soldier, on, foot, even, when, supplies, were, carried, by, beasts, of, burden, with, this, restriction, most, armies, could, not, travel, more, than, 32, kilometres, 20, mi, per, day, unless, travelling, on, rivers, only, small, elements, of, a, force, such, as, cavalry, or, specially, trained, light, troops, could, exceed, this, limit, this, restriction, on, tactical, mobility, remained, until, the, latter, years, of, world, war, i, when, the, advent, of, the, tank, improved, mobility, sufficiently, to, allow, decisive, tactical, manoeuvre, despite, this, advance, full, tactical, mobility, was, not, achieved, until, world, war, ii, when, armoured, and, motorised, formations, achieved, remarkable, successes, however, large, elements, of, the, armies, of, world, war, ii, remained, reliant, on, horse, drawn, transport, which, limited, tactical, mobility, within, the, overall, force, tactical, mobility, can, be, limited, by, the, use, of, field, obstacles, often, created, by, military, engineers, personal, armour, has, been, worn, since, the, classical, period, to, provide, a, measure, of, individual, protection, which, was, also, extended, to, include, barding, of, the, mount, the, limitations, of, armour, have, always, been, weight, and, bulk, and, its, consequent, effects, on, mobility, as, well, as, human, and, animal, endurance, by, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, personal, armour, had, been, largely, discarded, until, the, re, introduction, of, helmets, during, world, war, i, in, response, to, the, firepower, of, artillery, armoured, fighting, vehicles, proliferated, during, world, war, ii, and, after, that, war, body, armour, returned, for, the, infantry, particularly, in, western, armies, fortifications, which, have, been, used, since, ancient, times, provide, collective, protection, and, modern, examples, include, entrenchments, roadblocks, barbed, wire, and, minefields, like, obstacles, fortifications, are, often, created, by, military, engineers, shock, action, is, as, much, a, psychological, function, of, tactics, as, a, physical, one, and, can, be, significantly, enhanced, by, the, use, of, surprise, it, has, been, provided, by, charging, infantry, and, as, well, as, by, chariots, war, elephants, cavalry, and, armoured, vehicles, which, provide, momentum, to, an, assault, it, has, also, been, used, in, a, defensive, way, for, example, by, the, drenching, flights, of, arrows, from, english, longbowmen, at, the, battle, of, agincourt, in, 1415, which, caused, the, horses, of, the, french, knights, to, panic, during, early, modern, warfare, the, use, of, the, tactical, formations, of, columns, and, lines, had, a, greater, effect, than, the, firepower, of, the, formations, alone, during, the, early, stages, of, world, war, ii, the, combined, effects, of, german, machine, gun, and, tank, gun, firepower, enhanced, by, accurate, indirect, fire, and, air, attack, often, broke, up, allied, units, before, their, assault, commenced, or, caused, them, to, falter, due, to, casualties, among, key, unit, leaders, in, both, the, early, modern, and, world, war, ii, examples, the, cumulative, psychological, shock, effect, on, the, enemy, was, often, greater, than, the, actual, casualties, incurred, the, development, of, tactics, has, involved, a, shifting, balance, between, the, four, tactical, functions, since, ancient, times, and, changes, in, firepower, and, mobility, have, been, fundamental, to, these, changes, various, models, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, interaction, between, the, tactical, functions, and, the, dominance, of, individual, fighting, arms, during, different, periods, j, f, c, fuller, proposed, three, tactical, cycles, in, each, of, the, classical, and, christian, eras, for, the, latter, epoch, he, proposed, a, shock, cycle, between, 650, and, 1450, a, shock, and, projectile, cycle, 1450, 1850, and, a, projectile, cycle, from, 1850, with, respect, to, the, western, and, north, american, warfare, during, world, war, ii, tom, wintringham, proposed, six, chronological, periods, which, alternate, the, dominance, between, unarmoured, and, armoured, forces, and, highlight, tactical, trends, in, each, period, massed, volley, fire, by, archers, brought, infantry, firepower, to, the, fore, in, japanese, warfare, in, the, second, half, of, the, 13th, century, preceding, the, rise, of, the, english, longbowman, the, mobility, and, shock, action, of, the, oirat, mongol, army, at, the, battle, of, tumu, in, 1449, demonstrated, that, cavalry, could, still, defeat, a, large, infantry, force, in, both, the, european, and, oriental, traditions, of, warfare, the, advent, of, gunpowder, during, the, late, medieval, and, early, modern, periods, created, a, relentless, shift, to, infantry, firepower, becoming, a, decisive, if, not, dominant, arm, on, the, battlefield, exemplified, by, the, significant, impact, of, massed, arquebusiers, at, the, battle, of, nagashino, in, 1575, the, synchronisation, of, the, various, fighting, arms, to, achieve, the, tactical, mission, is, known, as, combined, arms, tactics, one, method, of, measuring, tactical, effectiveness, is, the, extent, to, which, the, arms, including, military, aviation, are, integrated, on, the, battlefield, a, key, principle, of, effective, combined, arms, tactics, is, that, for, maximum, potential, to, be, achieved, all, elements, of, combined, arms, teams, need, the, same, level, of, mobility, and, sufficient, firepower, and, protection, the, history, of, the, development, of, combined, arms, tactics, has, been, dogged, by, costly, and, painful, lessons, for, example, while, german, commanders, in, world, war, ii, clearly, understood, from, the, outset, the, key, principle, of, combined, arms, tactics, outlined, above, british, commanders, were, late, to, this, realisation, successful, combined, arms, tactics, require, the, fighting, arms, to, train, alongside, each, other, and, to, be, familiar, with, each, other, s, capabilities, beginning, in, the, latter, stages, of, world, war, i, airpower, has, brought, a, significant, change, to, military, tactics, world, war, ii, saw, the, development, of, close, air, support, which, greatly, enhanced, the, effect, of, ground, forces, with, the, use, of, aerial, firepower, and, improved, tactical, reconnaissance, and, the, interdiction, of, hostile, air, power, it, also, made, possible, the, supply, of, ground, forces, by, air, achieved, by, the, british, during, the, burma, campaign, but, unsuccessful, for, the, germans, at, the, battle, of, stalingrad, following, world, war, ii, rotary, wing, aircraft, had, a, significant, impact, on, firepower, and, mobility, comprising, a, fighting, arm, in, its, own, right, in, many, armies, aircraft, particularly, those, operating, at, low, or, medium, altitudes, remain, vulnerable, to, ground, based, air, defence, systems, as, well, as, other, aircraft, parachute, and, glider, operations, and, rotary, wing, aircraft, have, provided, significant, mobility, to, ground, forces, but, the, reduced, mobility, protection, and, firepower, of, troops, delivered, by, air, once, landed, has, limited, the, tactical, utility, of, such, vertical, envelopment, or, air, assault, operations, this, was, demonstrated, during, operation, market, garden, in, september, 1944, and, during, the, vietnam, war, in, the, latter, case, despite, the, additional, firepower, provided, by, helicopter, gunships, and, the, ability, quickly, to, remove, casualties, provided, by, aeromedical, evacuation, military, tactics, answer, the, questions, of, how, best, to, deploy, and, employ, forces, on, a, small, scale, some, practices, have, not, changed, since, the, dawn, of, warfare, assault, ambushes, skirmishing, turning, flanks, reconnaissance, creating, and, using, obstacles, and, defenses, etc, using, ground, to, best, advantage, has, not, changed, much, either, heights, rivers, swamps, passes, choke, points, and, natural, cover, can, all, be, used, in, multiple, ways, before, the, nineteenth, century, many, military, tactics, were, confined, to, battlefield, concerns, how, to, maneuver, units, during, combat, in, open, terrain, nowadays, specialized, tactics, exist, for, many, situations, for, example, for, securing, a, room, in, a, building, technological, changes, can, render, existing, tactics, obsolete, and, sociological, changes, can, shift, the, goals, and, methods, of, warfare, requiring, new, tactics, tactics, define, how, soldiers, are, armed, and, trained, thus, technology, and, society, influence, the, development, of, types, of, soldiers, or, warriors, through, history, greek, hoplite, roman, legionary, medieval, knight, turk, mongol, horse, archer, chinese, crossbowman, or, an, air, cavalry, trooper, each, constrained, by, his, weaponry, logistics, and, social, conditioning, would, use, a, battlefield, differently, but, would, usually, seek, the, same, outcomes, from, their, use, of, tactics, the, first, world, war, forced, great, changes, in, tactics, as, advances, in, technology, rendered, prior, tactics, useless, gray, zone, tactics, are, also, becoming, more, widely, used, these, include, everything, from, strong, arm, diplomacy, and, economic, coercion, to, media, manipulation, and, cyberattacks, to, use, of, paramilitaries, and, proxy, forces, the, title, gray, zone, comes, from, the, ambiguity, between, defense, vs, offense, as, well, as, the, ambiguity, between, peace, keeping, vs, war, effort
