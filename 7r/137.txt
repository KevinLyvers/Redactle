cultural, assimilation, is, the, process, in, which, a, minority, group, or, culture, comes, to, resemble, a, society, s, majority, group, or, assimilates, the, values, behaviors, and, beliefs, of, another, group, whether, fully, or, partially, the, different, types, of, cultural, assimilation, include, full, assimilation, and, forced, assimilation, full, assimilation, is, the, more, prevalent, of, the, two, as, it, occurs, spontaneously, when, used, as, a, political, ideology, assimilationism, refers, to, governmental, policies, of, deliberately, assimilating, ethnic, groups, into, the, national, culture, during, cultural, assimilation, minority, groups, are, expected, to, adapt, to, the, everyday, practices, of, the, dominant, culture, through, language, and, appearance, as, well, as, via, more, significant, socioeconomic, factors, such, as, absorption, into, the, local, cultural, and, employment, communities, some, types, of, cultural, assimilation, resemble, acculturation, in, which, a, minority, group, or, culture, completely, assimilates, into, the, dominant, culture, in, which, defining, characteristics, of, the, minority, culture, are, less, obverse, or, outright, disappear, while, in, other, types, of, cultural, assimilation, such, as, cultural, integration, mostly, found, in, multicultural, communities, a, minority, group, within, a, given, society, adopts, aspects, of, the, dominant, culture, through, either, cultural, diffusion, or, for, practical, reason, like, adapting, to, another, society, s, social, norms, while, retaining, their, original, culture, a, conceptualization, describes, cultural, assimilation, as, similar, to, acculturation, while, another, merely, considers, the, former, as, one, of, the, latter, s, phases, throughout, history, there, have, been, different, forms, of, cultural, assimilation, examples, of, types, of, acculturation, include, voluntary, and, involuntary, assimilation, assimilation, could, also, involve, the, so, called, additive, acculturation, wherein, instead, of, replacing, the, ancestral, culture, an, individual, expands, their, existing, cultural, repertoire, cultural, assimilation, may, involve, either, a, quick, or, a, gradual, change, depending, on, the, circumstances, of, the, group, full, assimilation, occurs, when, members, of, a, society, become, indistinguishable, from, those, of, the, dominant, group, in, society, whether, a, given, group, should, assimilate, is, often, disputed, by, both, members, of, the, group, and, others, in, society, cultural, assimilation, does, not, guarantee, social, alikeness, geographical, and, other, natural, barriers, between, cultures, even, if, created, by, the, predominant, culture, may, be, culturally, different, cultural, assimilation, can, happen, either, spontaneously, or, forcibly, the, latter, when, more, dominant, cultures, use, various, means, aimed, at, forced, assimilation, various, types, of, assimilation, including, forced, cultural, assimilation, are, particularly, relevant, regarding, indigenous, groups, during, colonialism, taking, place, between, the, 18th, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, this, type, of, assimilation, included, religious, conversion, separation, of, families, changes, of, gender, roles, division, of, property, among, foreign, power, elimination, of, local, economies, and, lack, of, sustainable, food, supply, whether, via, colonialism, or, within, one, nation, methods, of, forced, assimilation, are, often, unsustainable, leading, to, revolts, and, collapses, of, power, to, maintain, control, over, cultural, norms, often, cultures, that, are, forced, into, different, cultural, practices, through, forced, cultural, assimilation, revert, to, their, native, practices, and, religions, that, differ, from, the, forced, cultural, values, of, other, dominant, powers, in, addition, throughout, history, voluntary, assimilation, is, often, in, response, to, pressure, from, a, more, predominant, culture, and, conformity, is, a, solution, for, people, to, remain, in, safety, an, example, of, voluntary, cultural, assimilation, would, be, during, the, spanish, inquisition, when, jews, and, muslims, accepted, the, roman, catholic, church, as, their, religion, but, meanwhile, many, people, still, privately, practised, their, traditional, religions, that, type, of, assimilation, is, used, to, convince, a, dominant, power, that, a, culture, has, peacefully, assimilated, yet, often, voluntary, assimilation, does, not, mean, the, group, fully, conforms, to, the, accepted, cultural, beliefs, the, term, assimilation, is, often, used, about, not, only, indigenous, groups, but, also, immigrants, settled, in, a, new, land, a, new, culture, and, new, attitudes, toward, the, original, culture, are, obtained, through, contact, and, communication, assimilation, assumes, that, a, relatively, tenuous, culture, gets, to, be, united, into, one, unified, culture, that, process, happens, through, contact, and, accommodation, between, each, culture, the, current, definition, of, assimilation, is, usually, used, to, refer, to, immigrants, but, in, multiculturalism, cultural, assimilation, can, happen, all, over, the, world, and, within, varying, social, contexts, and, is, not, limited, to, specific, areas, social, scientists, rely, on, four, primary, benchmarks, to, assess, immigrant, assimilation, socioeconomic, status, geographic, distribution, second, language, attainment, and, intermarriage, william, a, v, clark, defines, immigrant, assimilation, in, the, united, states, as, a, way, of, understanding, the, social, dynamics, of, american, society, and, that, it, is, the, process, that, occurs, spontaneously, and, often, unintended, in, the, course, of, interaction, between, majority, and, minority, groups, studies, have, also, noted, the, positive, effects, of, immigrant, assimilation, a, study, by, bleakley, and, chin, 2010, found, that, people, who, arrived, in, the, us, at, or, before, the, age, of, nine, from, non, english, speaking, countries, tend, to, speak, english, at, a, similar, level, as, those, from, english, speaking, countries, conversely, those, who, arrived, after, nine, from, non, english, speaking, countries, have, much, lower, speaking, proficiency, and, this, increases, linearly, with, age, at, arrival, the, study, also, noted, sociocultural, impacts, such, as, those, with, better, english, skills, are, less, likely, to, be, currently, married, more, likely, to, divorce, have, fewer, children, and, have, spouses, closer, to, their, age, learning, to, speak, english, well, is, estimated, to, improve, income, by, over, 33, percent, a, 2014, study, done, by, verkuyten, found, that, immigrant, children, who, adapt, through, integration, or, assimilation, are, received, more, positively, by, their, peers, than, those, who, adapt, through, marginalization, or, separation, there, has, been, little, to, no, existing, research, or, evidence, that, demonstrates, whether, and, how, immigrant, s, mobility, gains, assimilating, to, a, dominant, country, such, as, language, ability, socioeconomic, status, etc, causes, changes, in, the, perception, of, those, who, were, born, in, the, dominant, country, this, essential, type, of, research, provides, information, on, how, immigrants, are, accepted, into, dominant, countries, in, an, article, by, ariela, schachter, titled, from, different, to, similar, an, experimental, approach, to, understanding, assimilation, a, survey, was, taken, of, white, american, citizens, to, view, their, perception, of, immigrants, who, now, resided, in, the, united, states, the, survey, indicated, the, whites, tolerated, immigrants, in, their, home, country, white, natives, are, open, to, having, structural, relation, with, the, immigrants, origin, individuals, for, instance, friends, and, neighbors, however, this, was, with, the, exception, of, black, immigrants, and, natives, and, undocumented, immigrants, however, at, the, same, time, white, americans, viewed, all, non, white, americans, regardless, of, legal, status, as, dissimilar, a, similar, journal, by, jens, hainmueller, and, daniel, j, hopkins, titled, the, hidden, american, immigration, consensus, a, conjoint, analysis, of, attitudes, toward, immigrants, confirmed, similar, attitudes, towards, immigrants, the, researchers, used, an, experiment, to, reach, their, goal, which, was, to, test, nine, theoretical, relevant, attributes, of, hypothetical, immigrants, asking, a, population, based, sample, of, u, s, citizens, to, decide, between, pairs, of, immigrants, applying, for, admission, to, the, united, states, the, u, s, citizen, would, see, an, application, with, information, for, two, immigrants, including, notes, about, their, education, status, country, origin, and, other, attributes, the, results, showed, americans, viewed, educated, immigrants, in, high, status, jobs, favourably, whereas, they, view, the, following, groups, unfavourably, those, who, lack, plans, to, work, those, who, entered, without, authorization, those, who, are, not, fluent, in, english, and, those, of, iraqi, descent, as, the, number, of, international, students, entering, the, us, has, increased, so, has, the, number, of, international, students, in, us, colleges, and, universities, the, adaptation, of, these, newcomers, is, important, in, cross, cultural, research, in, the, study, cross, cultural, adaptation, of, international, college, student, in, the, united, states, by, yikang, wang, the, goal, was, to, examine, how, the, psychological, and, socio, cultural, adaptation, of, international, college, students, varied, over, time, the, survey, contained, a, sample, of, 169, international, students, attending, a, coeducational, public, university, the, two, subtypes, of, adaptation, psychological, and, socio, cultural, were, examined, psychological, adaptation, refers, to, feelings, of, well, being, or, satisfaction, during, cross, cultural, transitions, while, socio, cultural, refers, to, the, ability, to, fit, into, the, new, culture, the, results, for, both, graduate, and, undergraduate, students, show, both, satisfaction, and, socio, cultural, skills, changed, over, time, psychological, adaptation, had, the, most, significant, change, for, a, student, who, has, resided, in, the, us, for, at, least, 24, months, while, socio, cultural, adaptation, steadily, increased, over, time, it, can, be, concluded, that, eventually, over, time, the, minority, group, will, shed, some, of, their, culture, s, characteristic, when, in, a, new, country, and, incorporate, new, culture, qualities, also, it, was, confirmed, that, more, time, spent, in, a, new, country, would, result, in, becoming, more, accustomed, to, the, dominant, countries, characteristics, figure, 2, demonstrates, as, the, length, of, time, resided, in, the, united, states, increase, the, dominant, country, the, life, satisfaction, and, socio, cultural, skill, increase, as, well, positive, correlation, in, turn, research, by, caligiuri, s, group, published, in, 2020, shows, that, one, semester, of, classroom, experiential, activities, designed, to, foster, international, and, domestic, student, social, interaction, serve, to, foster, international, students, sense, of, belonging, and, social, support, in, a, study, by, viola, angelini, life, satisfaction, of, immigrant, does, cultural, assimilation, matter, the, theory, of, assimilation, as, having, benefits, for, well, being, the, goal, of, this, study, was, to, assess, the, difference, between, cultural, assimilation, and, the, subjective, well, being, of, immigrants, the, journal, included, a, study, that, examined, a, direct, measure, of, assimilation, with, a, host, culture, and, immigrants, subjective, well, being, using, data, from, the, german, socio, economic, panel, it, was, concluded, that, there, was, a, positive, correlation, between, cultural, assimilation, and, an, immigrant, s, life, s, satisfaction, wellbeing, even, after, discarding, factors, such, as, employment, status, wages, etc, life, satisfaction, of, immigrant, does, cultural, assimilation, matter, also, confirms, association, with, life, satisfaction, is, stronger, for, established, immigrants, than, for, recent, ones, it, was, found, that, the, more, immigrants, that, identified, with, the, german, culture, and, who, spoke, the, fluent, national, language, dominant, country, language, the, more, they, reported, to, be, satisfied, with, their, lives, life, satisfaction, rates, were, higher, for, those, who, had, assimilated, to, the, dominant, country, than, those, who, had, not, assimilated, since, those, who, did, incorporate, the, dominant, language, religion, psychological, aspects, etc, in, the, study, examination, of, cultural, shock, intercultural, sensitivity, and, willingness, to, adopt, by, clare, d, souza, the, study, uses, a, diary, method, to, analyze, the, data, collected, the, study, involved, students, undergoing, a, study, abroad, tour, the, results, show, negative, intercultural, sensitivity, is, much, greater, in, participants, who, experience, culture, shock, those, who, experience, culture, shock, have, emotional, expression, and, responses, of, hostility, anger, negativity, anxiety, frustration, isolation, and, regression, also, for, one, who, has, traveled, to, the, country, before, permanently, moving, they, would, have, predetermined, beliefs, about, the, culture, and, their, status, within, the, country, the, emotional, expression, for, this, individual, includes, excitement, happiness, eagerness, and, euphoria, another, article, titled, international, students, from, melbourne, describing, their, cross, cultural, transitions, experiences, culture, shock, social, interaction, and, friendship, development, by, nish, belford, focuses, on, cultural, shock, belford, interviewed, international, students, to, explore, their, experience, after, living, and, studying, in, melbourne, australia, the, data, collected, were, narratives, from, the, students, that, focused, on, variables, such, as, cultural, similarity, intercultural, communication, competence, intercultural, friendship, and, relational, identity, to, influence, their, experiences, between, 1880, and, 1920, the, united, states, took, in, roughly, 24, million, immigrants, this, increase, in, immigration, can, be, attributed, to, many, historical, changes, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, has, also, marked, a, massive, era, of, immigration, and, sociologists, are, once, again, trying, to, make, sense, of, the, impacts, that, immigration, has, on, society, and, on, the, immigrants, themselves, assimilation, had, various, meanings, in, american, sociology, henry, pratt, fairchild, associates, american, assimilation, with, americanization, or, the, melting, pot, theory, some, scholars, also, believed, that, assimilation, and, acculturation, were, synonymous, according, to, a, common, point, of, view, assimilation, is, a, process, of, interpretation, and, fusion, from, another, group, or, person, that, may, include, memories, behaviors, and, sentiments, by, sharing, their, experiences, and, histories, they, blend, into, the, common, cultural, life, a, related, theory, is, structural, pluralism, proposed, by, american, sociologist, milton, gordon, it, describes, the, american, situation, wherein, despite, the, cultural, assimilation, of, ethnic, groups, to, mainstream, american, society, they, maintained, structural, separation, gordon, maintained, that, there, is, limited, integration, of, the, immigrants, into, american, social, institutions, such, as, educational, occupational, political, and, social, cliques, during, the, colonial, period, from, 1607, to, 1776, individuals, immigrated, to, the, british, colonies, on, two, very, different, paths, voluntary, and, forced, migration, those, who, migrated, to, the, colonies, on, their, own, volition, were, drawn, by, the, allure, of, cheap, land, high, wages, and, the, freedom, of, conscience, in, british, north, america, on, the, latter, half, the, largest, population, of, forced, migrants, to, the, colonies, was, african, slaves, slavery, was, different, from, the, other, forced, migrations, as, unlike, in, the, case, of, convicts, there, was, no, possibility, of, earning, freedom, although, some, slaves, were, manumitted, in, the, centuries, before, the, american, civil, war, the, long, history, of, immigration, in, the, established, gateways, means, that, the, place, of, immigrants, in, terms, of, class, racial, and, ethnic, hierarchies, in, the, traditional, gateways, is, more, structured, or, established, but, on, the, other, hand, the, new, gateways, do, not, have, much, immigration, history, and, so, the, place, of, immigrants, in, terms, of, class, racial, and, ethnic, hierarchies, are, less, defined, and, immigrants, may, have, more, influence, to, define, their, position, secondly, the, size, of, the, new, gateways, may, influence, immigrant, assimilation, having, a, smaller, gateway, may, influence, the, level, of, racial, segregation, among, immigrants, and, native, born, people, thirdly, the, difference, in, institutional, arrangements, may, influence, immigrant, assimilation, traditional, gateways, unlike, new, gateways, have, many, institutions, set, up, to, help, immigrants, such, as, legal, aid, bureaus, and, social, organizations, finally, waters, and, jimenez, have, only, speculated, that, those, differences, may, influence, immigrant, assimilation, and, the, way, researchers, that, should, assess, immigrant, assimilation, furthermore, the, advancement, and, integration, of, immigrants, into, the, united, states, has, accounted, for, 29, of, u, s, population, growth, since, 2000, recent, arrival, of, immigrants, to, the, united, states, has, been, examined, closely, over, the, last, two, decades, the, results, show, the, driving, factors, for, immigration, including, citizenship, homeownership, english, language, proficiency, job, status, and, earning, a, better, income, canada, s, multicultural, history, dates, back, to, the, period, european, colonization, from, the, 16th, to, 19th, centuries, with, waves, of, ethnic, european, emigration, to, the, region, in, the, 20th, century, indian, chinese, and, japanese, were, the, largest, immigrant, groups, canada, remains, one, of, the, largest, immigrant, populations, in, the, world, the, 2016, census, recorded, 7, 5, million, documented, immigrants, representing, a, fifth, of, the, country, s, total, population, focus, has, shifted, from, a, rhetoric, of, cultural, assimilation, to, cultural, integration, in, contrast, to, assimilationism, integration, aims, to, preserve, the, roots, of, a, minority, society, while, still, allowing, for, smooth, coexistence, with, the, dominant, culture, legislation, applying, the, policy, of, protection, over, aboriginal, australians, separating, them, from, white, society, was, adopted, in, some, states, and, territories, of, australia, when, they, were, still, colonies, before, the, federation, of, australia, in, the, victoria, in, 1867, western, australia, in, 1886, and, queensland, in, 1897, after, federation, new, south, wales, crafted, their, policy, in, 1909, south, australia, and, the, northern, territory, which, was, under, the, control, and, of, south, australia, at, the, time, in, 1910, 11, mission, stations, missions, and, government, run, aboriginal, reserves, were, created, and, aboriginal, people, moved, onto, them, legislation, restricted, their, movement, prohibited, alcohol, use, and, regulated, employment, the, policies, were, reinforced, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, when, it, was, realized, that, aboriginal, people, would, not, die, out, or, be, fully, absorbed, in, white, society, such, as, in, the, provisions, of, the, welfare, ordinance, 1953, in, which, aboriginal, people, were, made, wards, of, the, state, part, aboriginal, known, as, half, caste, children, were, forcibly, removed, from, their, parents, in, order, to, educate, them, in, european, ways, the, girls, were, often, trained, to, be, domestic, servants, the, protectionist, policies, were, discontinued, and, assimilationist, policies, took, over, these, proposed, that, full, blood, indigenous, australians, should, be, allowed, to, die, out, while, half, castes, were, encouraged, to, assimilate, into, the, white, community, indigenous, people, were, regarded, as, inferior, to, white, people, by, these, policies, and, often, experienced, discrimination, in, the, predominantly, white, towns, after, having, to, move, to, seek, work, between, 1910, and, 1970, several, generations, of, indigenous, children, were, removed, from, their, parents, and, have, become, known, as, the, stolen, generations, the, policy, has, done, lasting, damage, to, individuals, family, and, indigenous, culture, at, the, 1961, native, welfare, conference, in, canberra, australian, federal, and, state, government, ministers, formulated, an, official, definition, of, assimilation, of, indigenous, australians, for, government, contexts, federal, territories, minister, paul, hasluck, informed, the, house, of, representatives, in, april, 1961, that, the, policy, of, assimilation, means, in, the, view, of, all, australian, governments, that, all, aborigines, and, part, aborigines, are, expected, eventually, to, attain, the, same, manner, of, living, as, other, australians, and, to, live, as, members, of, a, single, australian, community, enjoying, the, same, rights, and, privileges, accepting, the, same, responsibilities, observing, the, same, customs, and, influenced, by, the, same, beliefs, hopes, and, loyalties, as, other, australians, thus, any, special, measures, taken, for, aborigines, and, part, aborigines, are, regarded, as, temporary, measures, not, based, on, colour, but, intended, to, meet, their, need, for, special, care, and, assistance, to, protect, them, from, any, ill, effects, of, sudden, change, and, to, assist, them, to, make, the, transition, from, one, stage, to, another, in, such, a, way, as, will, be, favourable, to, their, future, social, economic, and, political, advancement, in, january, 2019, the, newly, elected, brazil, president, jair, bolsonaro, stripped, the, indigenous, affairs, agency, funai, of, the, responsibility, to, identify, and, demarcate, indigenous, lands, he, argued, that, those, territories, have, very, tiny, isolated, populations, and, proposed, to, integrate, them, into, the, larger, brazilian, society, according, to, the, survival, international, taking, responsibility, for, indigenous, land, demarcation, away, from, funai, the, indian, affairs, department, and, giving, it, to, the, agriculture, ministry, is, virtually, a, declaration, of, open, warfare, against, brazil, s, tribal, peoples, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, and, continuing, until, 1996, when, the, last, canadian, indian, residential, school, was, closed, the, canadian, government, aided, by, christian, churches, began, an, assimilationist, campaign, to, forcibly, assimilate, indigenous, peoples, in, canada, the, government, consolidated, power, over, indigenous, land, through, treaties, and, the, use, of, force, eventually, isolating, most, indigenous, peoples, to, reserves, marriage, practices, and, spiritual, ceremonies, were, banned, and, spiritual, leaders, were, imprisoned, additionally, the, canadian, government, instituted, an, extensive, residential, school, system, to, assimilate, children, indigenous, children, were, separated, from, their, families, and, no, longer, permitted, to, express, their, culture, at, these, new, schools, they, were, not, allowed, to, speak, their, language, or, practice, their, own, traditions, without, receiving, punishment, there, were, many, cases, of, violence, and, sexual, abuse, committed, by, the, christian, church, the, truth, and, reconciliation, commission, of, canada, concluded, that, this, effort, amounted, to, cultural, genocide, the, schools, actively, worked, to, alienate, children, from, their, cultural, roots, students, were, prohibited, from, speaking, their, native, languages, were, regularly, abused, and, were, arranged, marriages, by, the, government, after, their, graduation, the, explicit, goal, of, the, canadian, government, through, the, catholic, and, anglican, churches, was, to, completely, assimilate, indigenous, peoples, into, broader, canadian, society, and, destroy, all, traces, of, their, native, history, during, croatia, s, personal, union, with, hungary, ethnic, croatians, were, pressured, to, abandon, their, traditional, customs, in, favor, of, adopting, elements, of, hungarian, culture, such, as, catholicism, and, the, latin, alphabet, because, of, this, elements, of, hungarian, culture, were, considered, part, of, croatian, culture, and, can, still, be, seen, in, modern, croatian, culture, throughout, the, kingdom, of, hungary, many, citizens, primarily, those, who, belonged, to, minority, groups, were, forced, to, convert, to, catholicism, the, forced, conversion, policy, was, harshest, in, croatia, and, transylvania, where, civilians, could, be, sent, to, prison, for, refusing, to, convert, romanian, cultural, anthropologist, ioan, lupa, claims, that, between, 1002, when, transylvania, became, part, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, to, 1300, approximately, 200, 000, non, hungarians, living, in, transylvania, were, jailed, for, resisting, catholic, conversion, and, about, 50, 000, of, them, died, in, prison, a, major, contributor, to, cultural, assimilation, in, south, america, began, during, exploration, and, colonialism, that, often, is, thought, by, bartolom, de, las, casas, to, begin, in, 1492, when, europeans, began, to, explore, the, atlantic, in, search, of, the, indies, leading, to, the, discovery, of, the, americas, europe, remained, dominant, over, the, americas, indigenous, populations, as, resources, such, as, labor, natural, resources, i, e, lumber, copper, gold, silver, and, agricultural, products, flooded, into, europe, yet, these, gains, were, one, sided, as, indigenous, groups, did, not, benefit, from, trade, deals, with, colonial, powers, in, addition, to, this, colonial, metropoles, such, as, portugal, and, spain, required, that, colonies, in, south, america, assimilate, to, european, customs, such, as, following, the, holy, roman, catholic, church, acceptance, of, spanish, or, portuguese, over, indigenous, languages, and, accepting, european, style, government, through, forceful, assimilationist, policies, colonial, powers, such, as, spain, used, methods, of, violence, to, assert, cultural, dominance, over, indigenous, populations, one, example, occurred, in, 1519, when, the, spanish, explorer, hern, n, cort, s, reached, tenochtitl, n, the, original, capital, of, the, aztec, empire, in, mexico, after, discovering, that, the, aztecs, practiced, human, sacrifice, cort, s, killed, high, ranked, aztecs, and, held, moctezuma, ii, the, aztec, ruler, captive, shortly, after, cort, s, began, creating, alliances, to, resume, power, in, tenochtitl, n, and, renamed, it, mexico, city, without, taking, away, power, through, murder, and, spread, of, infectious, diseases, the, spanish, conquistadores, relatively, small, in, number, would, not, have, been, able, to, take, over, mexico, and, convert, many, people, to, catholicism, and, slavery, while, spaniards, influenced, linguistic, and, religious, cultural, assimilation, among, indigenous, peoples, in, south, america, during, colonialism, many, indigenous, languages, such, as, the, incan, language, quechua, are, still, used, in, places, such, as, peru, to, this, day, by, at, least, 4, million, people, in, the, course, of, the, colonization, of, new, zealand, from, the, late, 18th, century, onwards, assimilation, of, the, indigenous, maori, population, to, the, culture, of, incoming, european, visitors, and, settlers, at, first, occurred, spontaneously, genetic, assimilation, commenced, early, and, continued, the, 1961, new, zealand, census, classified, only, 62, 2, of, m, ori, as, full, blood, maoris, compare, p, keh, m, ori, linguistic, assimilation, also, occurred, early, and, ongoingly, european, settler, populations, adopted, and, adapted, m, ori, words, while, european, languages, affected, m,
