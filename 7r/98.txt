a, mortgage, loan, or, simply, mortgage, m, r, d, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, known, also, as, a, hypothec, loan, is, a, loan, used, either, by, purchasers, of, real, property, to, raise, funds, to, buy, real, estate, or, by, existing, property, owners, to, raise, funds, for, any, purpose, while, putting, a, lien, on, the, property, being, mortgaged, the, loan, is, secured, on, the, borrower, s, property, through, a, process, known, as, mortgage, origination, this, means, that, a, legal, mechanism, is, put, into, place, which, allows, the, lender, to, take, possession, and, sell, the, secured, property, foreclosure, or, repossession, to, pay, off, the, loan, in, the, event, the, borrower, defaults, on, the, loan, or, otherwise, fails, to, abide, by, its, terms, the, word, mortgage, is, derived, from, a, law, french, term, used, in, britain, in, the, middle, ages, meaning, death, pledge, and, refers, to, the, pledge, ending, dying, when, either, the, obligation, is, fulfilled, or, the, property, is, taken, through, foreclosure, a, mortgage, can, also, be, described, as, a, borrower, giving, consideration, in, the, form, of, a, collateral, for, a, benefit, loan, mortgage, borrowers, can, be, individuals, mortgaging, their, home, or, they, can, be, businesses, mortgaging, commercial, property, for, example, their, own, business, premises, residential, property, let, to, tenants, or, an, investment, portfolio, the, lender, will, typically, be, a, financial, institution, such, as, a, bank, credit, union, or, building, society, depending, on, the, country, concerned, and, the, loan, arrangements, can, be, made, either, directly, or, indirectly, through, intermediaries, features, of, mortgage, loans, such, as, the, size, of, the, loan, maturity, of, the, loan, interest, rate, method, of, paying, off, the, loan, and, other, characteristics, can, vary, considerably, the, lender, s, rights, over, the, secured, property, take, priority, over, the, borrower, s, other, creditors, which, means, that, if, the, borrower, becomes, bankrupt, or, insolvent, the, other, creditors, will, only, be, repaid, the, debts, owed, to, them, from, a, sale, of, the, secured, property, if, the, mortgage, lender, is, repaid, in, full, first, in, many, jurisdictions, it, is, normal, for, home, purchases, to, be, funded, by, a, mortgage, loan, few, individuals, have, enough, savings, or, liquid, funds, to, enable, them, to, purchase, property, outright, in, countries, where, the, demand, for, home, ownership, is, highest, strong, domestic, markets, for, mortgages, have, developed, mortgages, can, either, be, funded, through, the, banking, sector, that, is, through, short, term, deposits, or, through, the, capital, markets, through, a, process, called, securitization, which, converts, pools, of, mortgages, into, fungible, bonds, that, can, be, sold, to, investors, in, small, denominations, according, to, anglo, american, property, law, a, mortgage, occurs, when, an, owner, usually, of, a, fee, simple, freehold, interest, in, real, property, but, frequently, leasehold, in, england, and, wales, pledges, his, or, her, interest, right, to, the, property, as, security, or, collateral, for, a, loan, therefore, a, mortgage, is, an, encumbrance, limitation, on, the, right, to, the, property, just, as, an, easement, would, be, but, because, most, mortgages, occur, as, a, condition, for, new, loan, money, the, word, mortgage, has, become, the, generic, term, for, a, loan, secured, by, such, real, property, as, with, other, types, of, loans, mortgages, have, an, interest, rate, and, are, scheduled, to, amortize, over, a, set, period, of, time, typically, 30, years, in, the, united, states, all, types, of, real, property, can, be, and, usually, are, secured, with, a, mortgage, and, bear, an, interest, rate, that, is, supposed, to, reflect, the, lender, s, risk, mortgage, lending, is, the, primary, mechanism, used, in, many, countries, to, finance, private, ownership, of, residential, and, commercial, property, see, commercial, mortgages, although, the, terminology, and, precise, forms, will, differ, from, country, to, country, the, basic, components, tend, to, be, similar, many, other, specific, characteristics, are, common, to, many, markets, but, the, above, are, the, essential, features, governments, usually, regulate, many, aspects, of, mortgage, lending, either, directly, through, legal, requirements, for, example, or, indirectly, through, regulation, of, the, participants, or, the, financial, markets, such, as, the, banking, industry, and, often, through, state, intervention, direct, lending, by, the, government, direct, lending, by, state, owned, banks, or, sponsorship, of, various, entities, other, aspects, that, define, a, specific, mortgage, market, may, be, regional, historical, or, driven, by, specific, characteristics, of, the, legal, or, financial, system, mortgage, loans, are, generally, structured, as, long, term, loans, the, periodic, payments, for, which, are, similar, to, an, annuity, and, calculated, according, to, the, time, value, of, money, formulae, the, most, basic, arrangement, would, require, a, fixed, monthly, payment, over, a, period, of, ten, to, thirty, years, depending, on, local, conditions, over, this, period, the, principal, component, of, the, loan, the, original, loan, would, be, slowly, paid, down, through, amortization, in, practice, many, variants, are, possible, and, common, worldwide, and, within, each, country, lenders, provide, funds, against, property, to, earn, interest, income, and, generally, borrow, these, funds, themselves, for, example, by, taking, deposits, or, issuing, bonds, the, price, at, which, the, lenders, borrow, money, therefore, affects, the, cost, of, borrowing, lenders, may, also, in, many, countries, sell, the, mortgage, loan, to, other, parties, who, are, interested, in, receiving, the, stream, of, cash, payments, from, the, borrower, often, in, the, form, of, a, security, by, means, of, a, securitization, mortgage, lending, will, also, take, into, account, the, perceived, riskiness, of, the, mortgage, loan, that, is, the, likelihood, that, the, funds, will, be, repaid, usually, considered, a, function, of, the, creditworthiness, of, the, borrower, that, if, they, are, not, repaid, the, lender, will, be, able, to, foreclose, on, the, real, estate, assets, and, the, financial, interest, rate, risk, and, time, delays, that, may, be, involved, in, certain, circumstances, during, the, mortgage, loan, approval, process, a, mortgage, loan, underwriter, verifies, the, financial, information, that, the, applicant, has, provided, as, to, income, employment, credit, history, and, the, value, of, the, home, being, purchased, via, an, appraisal, an, appraisal, may, be, ordered, the, underwriting, process, may, take, a, few, days, to, a, few, weeks, sometimes, the, underwriting, process, takes, so, long, that, the, provided, financial, statements, need, to, be, resubmitted, so, they, are, current, it, is, advisable, to, maintain, the, same, employment, and, not, to, use, or, open, new, credit, during, the, underwriting, process, any, changes, made, in, the, applicant, s, credit, employment, or, financial, information, could, result, in, the, loan, being, denied, there, are, many, types, of, mortgages, used, worldwide, but, several, factors, broadly, define, the, characteristics, of, the, mortgage, all, of, these, may, be, subject, to, local, regulation, and, legal, requirements, the, two, basic, types, of, amortized, loans, are, the, fixed, rate, mortgage, frm, and, adjustable, rate, mortgage, arm, also, known, as, a, floating, rate, or, variable, rate, mortgage, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, fixed, rate, mortgages, are, the, norm, but, floating, rate, mortgages, are, relatively, common, combinations, of, fixed, and, floating, rate, mortgages, are, also, common, whereby, a, mortgage, loan, will, have, a, fixed, rate, for, some, period, for, example, the, first, five, years, and, vary, after, the, end, of, that, period, the, charge, to, the, borrower, depends, upon, the, credit, risk, in, addition, to, the, interest, rate, risk, the, mortgage, origination, and, underwriting, process, involves, checking, credit, scores, debt, to, income, downpayments, deposits, assets, and, assessing, property, value, jumbo, mortgages, and, subprime, lending, are, not, supported, by, government, guarantees, and, face, higher, interest, rates, other, innovations, described, below, can, affect, the, rates, as, well, upon, making, a, mortgage, loan, for, the, purchase, of, a, property, lenders, usually, require, that, the, borrower, make, a, down, payment, called, a, deposit, in, english, law, that, is, contribute, a, portion, of, the, cost, of, the, property, this, down, payment, may, be, expressed, as, a, portion, of, the, value, of, the, property, see, below, for, a, definition, of, this, term, the, loan, to, value, ratio, or, ltv, is, the, size, of, the, loan, against, the, value, of, the, property, therefore, a, mortgage, loan, in, which, the, purchaser, has, made, a, down, payment, of, 20, has, a, loan, to, value, ratio, of, 80, for, loans, made, against, properties, that, the, borrower, already, owns, the, loan, to, value, ratio, will, be, imputed, against, the, estimated, value, of, the, property, the, loan, to, value, ratio, is, considered, an, important, indicator, of, the, riskiness, of, a, mortgage, loan, the, higher, the, ltv, the, higher, the, risk, that, the, value, of, the, property, in, case, of, foreclosure, will, be, insufficient, to, cover, the, remaining, principal, of, the, loan, since, the, value, of, the, property, is, an, important, factor, in, understanding, the, risk, of, the, loan, determining, the, value, is, a, key, factor, in, mortgage, lending, the, value, may, be, determined, in, various, ways, but, the, most, common, are, in, most, countries, a, number, of, more, or, less, standard, measures, of, creditworthiness, may, be, used, common, measures, include, payment, to, income, mortgage, payments, as, a, percentage, of, gross, or, net, income, debt, to, income, all, debt, payments, including, mortgage, payments, as, a, percentage, of, income, and, various, net, worth, measures, in, many, countries, credit, scores, are, used, in, lieu, of, or, to, supplement, these, measures, there, will, also, be, requirements, for, documentation, of, the, creditworthiness, such, as, income, tax, returns, pay, stubs, etc, the, specifics, will, vary, from, location, to, location, income, tax, incentives, usually, can, be, applied, in, forms, of, tax, refunds, or, tax, deduction, schemes, the, first, implies, that, income, tax, paid, by, individual, taxpayers, will, be, refunded, to, the, extent, of, interest, on, mortgage, loans, taken, to, acquire, residential, property, income, tax, deduction, implies, lowering, tax, liability, to, the, extent, of, interest, rate, paid, for, the, mortgage, loan, some, lenders, may, also, require, a, potential, borrower, have, one, or, more, months, of, reserve, assets, available, in, other, words, the, borrower, may, be, required, to, show, the, availability, of, enough, assets, to, pay, for, the, housing, costs, including, mortgage, taxes, etc, for, a, period, of, time, in, the, event, of, the, job, loss, or, other, loss, of, income, many, countries, have, lower, requirements, for, certain, borrowers, or, no, doc, low, doc, lending, standards, that, may, be, acceptable, under, certain, circumstances, many, countries, have, a, notion, of, standard, or, conforming, mortgages, that, define, a, perceived, acceptable, level, of, risk, which, may, be, formal, or, informal, and, may, be, reinforced, by, laws, government, intervention, or, market, practice, for, example, a, standard, mortgage, may, be, considered, to, be, one, with, no, more, than, 70, 80, ltv, and, no, more, than, one, third, of, gross, income, going, to, mortgage, debt, a, standard, or, conforming, mortgage, is, a, key, concept, as, it, often, defines, whether, or, not, the, mortgage, can, be, easily, sold, or, securitized, or, if, non, standard, may, affect, the, price, at, which, it, may, be, sold, in, the, united, states, a, conforming, mortgage, is, one, which, meets, the, established, rules, and, procedures, of, the, two, major, government, sponsored, entities, in, the, housing, finance, market, including, some, legal, requirements, in, contrast, lenders, who, decide, to, make, nonconforming, loans, are, exercising, a, higher, risk, tolerance, and, do, so, knowing, that, they, face, more, challenge, in, reselling, the, loan, many, countries, have, similar, concepts, or, agencies, that, define, what, are, standard, mortgages, regulated, lenders, such, as, banks, may, be, subject, to, limits, or, higher, risk, weightings, for, non, standard, mortgages, for, example, banks, and, mortgage, brokerages, in, canada, face, restrictions, on, lending, more, than, 80, of, the, property, value, beyond, this, level, mortgage, insurance, is, generally, required, in, some, countries, with, currencies, that, tend, to, depreciate, foreign, currency, mortgages, are, common, enabling, lenders, to, lend, in, a, stable, foreign, currency, whilst, the, borrower, takes, on, the, currency, risk, that, the, currency, will, depreciate, and, they, will, therefore, need, to, convert, higher, amounts, of, the, domestic, currency, to, repay, the, loan, in, addition, to, the, two, standard, means, of, setting, the, cost, of, a, mortgage, loan, fixed, at, a, set, interest, rate, for, the, term, or, variable, relative, to, market, interest, rates, there, are, variations, in, how, that, cost, is, paid, and, how, the, loan, itself, is, repaid, repayment, depends, on, locality, tax, laws, and, prevailing, culture, there, are, also, various, mortgage, repayment, structures, to, suit, different, types, of, borrower, the, most, common, way, to, repay, a, secured, mortgage, loan, is, to, make, regular, payments, toward, the, principal, and, interest, over, a, set, term, commonly, referred, to, as, self, amortization, in, the, u, s, and, as, a, repayment, mortgage, in, the, uk, a, mortgage, is, a, form, of, annuity, from, the, perspective, of, the, lender, and, the, calculation, of, the, periodic, payments, is, based, on, the, time, value, of, money, formulas, certain, details, may, be, specific, to, different, locations, interest, may, be, calculated, on, the, basis, of, a, 360, day, year, for, example, interest, may, be, compounded, daily, yearly, or, semi, annually, prepayment, penalties, may, apply, and, other, factors, there, may, be, legal, restrictions, on, certain, matters, and, consumer, protection, laws, may, specify, or, prohibit, certain, practices, depending, on, the, size, of, the, loan, and, the, prevailing, practice, in, the, country, the, term, may, be, short, 10, years, or, long, 50, years, plus, in, the, uk, and, u, s, 25, to, 30, years, is, the, usual, maximum, term, although, shorter, periods, such, as, 15, year, mortgage, loans, are, common, mortgage, payments, which, are, typically, made, monthly, contain, a, repayment, of, the, principal, and, an, interest, element, the, amount, going, toward, the, principal, in, each, payment, varies, throughout, the, term, of, the, mortgage, in, the, early, years, the, repayments, are, mostly, interest, towards, the, end, of, the, mortgage, payments, are, mostly, for, principal, in, this, way, the, payment, amount, determined, at, outset, is, calculated, to, ensure, the, loan, is, repaid, at, a, specified, date, in, the, future, this, gives, borrowers, assurance, that, by, maintaining, repayment, the, loan, will, be, cleared, at, a, specified, date, if, the, interest, rate, does, not, change, some, lenders, and, 3rd, parties, offer, a, bi, weekly, mortgage, payment, program, designed, to, accelerate, the, payoff, of, the, loan, similarly, a, mortgage, can, be, ended, before, its, scheduled, end, by, paying, some, or, all, of, the, remainder, prematurely, called, curtailment, an, amortization, schedule, is, typically, worked, out, taking, the, principal, left, at, the, end, of, each, month, multiplying, by, the, monthly, rate, and, then, subtracting, the, monthly, payment, this, is, typically, generated, by, an, amortization, calculator, using, the, following, formula, a, p, r, 1, r, n, 1, r, n, 1, displaystyle, a, p, cdot, frac, r, 1, r, n, 1, r, n, 1, where, the, main, alternative, to, a, principal, and, interest, mortgage, is, an, interest, only, mortgage, where, the, principal, is, not, repaid, throughout, the, term, this, type, of, mortgage, is, common, in, the, uk, especially, when, associated, with, a, regular, investment, plan, with, this, arrangement, regular, contributions, are, made, to, a, separate, investment, plan, designed, to, build, up, a, lump, sum, to, repay, the, mortgage, at, maturity, this, type, of, arrangement, is, called, an, investment, backed, mortgage, or, is, often, related, to, the, type, of, plan, used, endowment, mortgage, if, an, endowment, policy, is, used, similarly, a, personal, equity, plan, pep, mortgage, individual, savings, account, isa, mortgage, or, pension, mortgage, historically, investment, backed, mortgages, offered, various, tax, advantages, over, repayment, mortgages, although, this, is, no, longer, the, case, in, the, uk, investment, backed, mortgages, are, seen, as, higher, risk, as, they, are, dependent, on, the, investment, making, sufficient, return, to, clear, the, debt, until, recently, it, was, not, uncommon, for, interest, only, mortgages, to, be, arranged, without, a, repayment, vehicle, with, the, borrower, gambling, that, the, property, market, will, rise, sufficiently, for, the, loan, to, be, repaid, by, trading, down, at, retirement, or, when, rent, on, the, property, and, inflation, combine, to, surpass, the, interest, rate, recent, financial, services, authority, guidelines, to, uk, lenders, regarding, interest, only, mortgages, have, tightened, the, criteria, on, new, lending, on, an, interest, only, basis, the, problem, for, many, people, has, been, the, fact, that, no, repayment, vehicle, had, been, implemented, or, the, vehicle, itself, e, g, endowment, isa, policy, performed, poorly, and, therefore, insufficient, funds, were, available, to, repay, balance, at, the, end, of, the, term, moving, forward, the, fsa, under, the, mortgage, market, review, mmr, have, stated, there, must, be, strict, criteria, on, the, repayment, vehicle, being, used, as, such, the, likes, of, nationwide, and, other, lenders, have, pulled, out, of, the, interest, only, market, a, resurgence, in, the, equity, release, market, has, been, the, introduction, of, interest, only, lifetime, mortgages, where, an, interest, only, mortgage, has, a, fixed, term, an, interest, only, lifetime, mortgage, will, continue, for, the, rest, of, the, mortgagors, life, these, schemes, have, proved, of, interest, to, people, who, do, like, the, roll, up, effect, compounding, of, interest, on, traditional, equity, release, schemes, they, have, also, proved, beneficial, to, people, who, had, an, interest, only, mortgage, with, no, repayment, vehicle, and, now, need, to, settle, the, loan, these, people, can, now, effectively, remortgage, onto, an, interest, only, lifetime, mortgage, to, maintain, continuity, interest, only, lifetime, mortgage, schemes, are, currently, offered, by, two, lenders,

rest, of, their, life, this, market, is, set, to, increase, as, more, retirees, require, finance, in, retirement, for, older, borrowers, typically, in, retirement, it, may, be, possible, to, arrange, a, mortgage, where, neither, the, principal, nor, interest, is, repaid, the, interest, is, rolled, up, with, the, principal, increasing, the, debt, each, year, these, arrangements, are, variously, called, reverse, mortgages, lifetime, mortgages, or, equity, release, mortgages, referring, to, home, equity, depending, on, the, country, the, loans, are, typically, not, repaid, until, the,

receive, funds, in, a, variety, of, ways, as, a, one, time, lump, sum, payment, as, a, monthly, tenure, payment, which, continues, until, the, borrower, dies, or, moves, out, of, the, house,

lending, practices, resulted, in, the, national, mortgage, crisis, of, the, 1930s, the, savings, and, loan, crisis, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, and, the, subprime, mortgage, crisis, of, 2007, which, led, to, the, 2010, foreclosure, crisis, in, the, united, states, the, mortgage, loan, involves, two, separate, documents, the, mortgage, note, a, promissory, note, and, the, security, interest, evidenced, by, the, mortgage, document, generally, the, two, are, assigned, together, but, if, they, are, split, traditionally, the, holder, of, the, note, and, not, the, mortgage, has, the, right, to, foreclose, for, example, fannie, mae, promulgates, a, standard, form, contract, multistate, fixed, rate, note, 3200, and, also, separate, security, instrument, mortgage, forms, which, vary, by, state, in, canada, the, canada, mortgage, and, housing, corporation, cmhc, is, the, country, s, national, housing, agency, providing, mortgage, loan, insurance, mortgage, backed, securities, housing, policy, and, programs, and, housing, research, to, canadians, it, was, created, by, the, federal, government, in, 1946, to, address, the, country, s, post, war, housing, shortage, and, to, help, canadians, achieve, their, homeownership, goals, the, most, common, mortgage, in, canada, is, the, five, year, fixed, rate, closed, mortgage, as, opposed, to, the, u, s, where, the, most, common, type, is, the, 30, year, fixed, rate, open, mortgage, throughout, the, financial, crisis, and, the, ensuing, recession, canada, s, mortgage, market, continued, to, function, well, partly, due, to, the, residential, mortgage, market, s, policy, framework, which, includes, an, effective, regulatory, and, supervisory, regime, that, applies, to, most, lenders, since, the, crisis, however, the, low, interest, rate, environment, that, has, arisen, has, contributed, to, a, significant, increase, in, mortgage, debt, in, the, country, in, april, 2014, the, office, of, the, superintendent, of, financial, institutions, osfi, released, guidelines, for, mortgage, insurance, providers, aimed, at, tightening, standards, around, underwriting, and, risk, management, in, a, statement, the, osfi, has, stated, that, the, guideline, will, provide, clarity, about, best, practices, in, respect, of, residential, mortgage, insurance, underwriting, which, contribute, to, a, stable, financial, system, this, comes, after, several, years, of, federal, government, scrutiny, over, the, cmhc, with, former, finance, minister, jim, flaherty, musing, publicly, as, far, back, as, 2012, about, privatizing, the, crown, corporation, in, an, attempt, to, cool, down, the, real, estate, prices, in, canada, ottawa, introduced, a, mortgage, stress, test, effective, 17, october, 2016, under, the, stress, test, every, home, buyer, who, wants, to, get, a, mortgage, from, any, federally, regulated, lender, should, undergo, a, test, in, which, the, borrower, s, affordability, is, judged, based, on, a, rate, that, is, not, lower, than, a, stress, rate, set, by, the, bank, of, canada, for, high, ratio, mortgage, loan, to, value, of, more, than, 80, which, is, insured, by, canada, mortgage, and, housing, corporation, the, rate, is, the, maximum, of, the, stress, test, rate, and, the, current, target, rate, however, for, uninsured, mortgage, the, rate, is, the, maximum, of, the, stress, test, rate, and, the, target, interest, rate, plus, 2, this, stress, test, has, lowered, the, maximum, mortgage, approved, amount, for, all, borrowers, in, canada, the, stress, test, rate, consistently, increased, until, its, peak, of, 5, 34, in, may, 2018, and, it, was, not, changed, until, july, 2019, in, which, for, the, first, time, in, three, years, it, decreased, to, 5, 19, this, decision, may, reflect, the, push, back, from, the, real, estate, industry, as, well, as, the, introduction, of, the, first, time, home, buyer, incentive, program, fthbi, by, the, canadian, government, in, the, 2019, canadian, federal, budget, because, of, all, the, criticisms, from, real, estate, industry, canada, finance, minister, bill, morneau, ordered, to, review, and, consider, changes, to, the, mortgage, stress, test, in, december, 2019, the, mortgage, industry, of, the, united, kingdom, has, traditionally, been, dominated, by, building, societies, but, from, the, 1970s, the, share, of, the, new, mortgage, loans, market, held, by, building, societies, has, declined, substantially, between, 1977, and, 1987, the, share, fell, from, 96, to, 66, while, that, of, banks, and, other, institutions, rose, from, 3, to, 36, the, figures, have, since, changed, further, in, favour, of, banks, in, part, due, to, demutualisation, there, are, currently, over, 200, significant, separate, financial, organizations, supplying, mortgage, loans, to, house, buyers, in, britain, the, major, lenders, include, building, societies, banks, specialized, mortgage, corporations, insurance, companies, and, pension, funds, in, the, uk, variable, rate, mortgages, are, more, common, than, in, the, united, states, this, is, in, part, because, mortgage, loan, financing, relies, less, on, fixed, income, securitized, assets, such, as, mortgage, backed, securities, than, in, the, united, states, denmark, and, germany, and, more, on, retail, savings, deposits, like, australia, and, spain, thus, lenders, prefer, variable, rate, mortgages, to, fixed, rate, ones, and, whole, of, term, fixed, rate, mortgages, are, generally, not, available, nevertheless, in, recent, years, fixing, the, rate, of, the, mortgage, for, short, periods, has, become, popular, and, the, initial, two, three, five, and, occasionally, ten, years, of, a, mortgage, can, be, fixed, from, 2007, to, the, beginning, of, 2013, between, 50, and, 83, of, new, mortgages, had, initial, periods, fixed, in, this, way, home, ownership, rates, are, comparable, to, the, united, states, but, overall, default, rates, are, lower, prepayment, penalties, during, a, fixed, rate, period, are, common, whilst, the, united, states, has, discouraged, their, use, like, other, european, countries, and, the, rest, of, the, world, but, unlike, most, of, the, united, states, mortgages, loans, are, usually, not, nonrecourse, debt, meaning, debtors, are, liable, for, any, loan, deficiencies, after, foreclosure, the, customer, facing, aspects, of, the, residential, mortgage, sector, are, regulated, by, the, financial, conduct, authority, fca, and, lenders, financial, probity, is, overseen, by, a, separate, regulator, the, prudential, regulation, authority, pra, which, is, part, of, the, bank, of, england, the, fca, and, pra, were, established, in, 2013, with, the, aim, of, responding, to, criticism, of, regulatory, failings, highlighted, by, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, and, its, aftermath, western, european, countries, present, a, diversified, landscape, with, some, countries, france, belgium, germany, the, netherlands, denmark, where, fixed, rate, mortgages, are, the, norm, and, some, countries, austria, greece, italy, portugal, spain, sweden, favouring, adjustable, rate, mortgages, much, of, europe, has, home, ownership, rates, comparable, to, the, united, states, but, overall, default, rates, are, lower, in, europe, than, in, the, united, states, mortgage, loan, financing, relies, less, on, securitizing, mortgages, and, more, on, formal, government, guarantees, backed, by, covered, bonds, such, as, the, pfandbriefe, and, deposits, except, denmark, and, germany, where, asset, backed, securities, are, also, common, prepayment, penalties, are, still, common, whilst, the, united, states, has, discouraged, their, use, unlike, much, of, the, united, states, mortgage, loans, are, usually, not, nonrecourse, debt, within, the, european, union, covered, bonds, market, volume, covered, bonds, outstanding, amounted, to, about, 2, trillion, at, year, end, 2007, with, germany, denmark, spain, and, france, each, having, outstandings, above, 200, billion, pfandbrief, like, securities, have, been, introduced, in, more, than, 25, european, countries, and, in, recent, years, also, in, the, u, s, and, other, countries, outside, europe, each, with, their, own, unique, law, and, regulations, on, july, 28, 2008, us, treasury, secretary, henry, paulson, announced, that, along, with, four, large, u, s, banks, the, treasury, would, attempt, to, kick, start, a, market, for, these, securities, in, the, united, states, primarily, to, provide, an, alternative, form, of, mortgage, backed, securities, similarly, in, the, uk, the, government, is, inviting, views, on, options, for, a, uk, framework, to, deliver, more, affordable, long, term, fixed, rate, mortgages, including, the, lessons, to, be, learned, from, international, markets, and, institutions, george, soros, s, october, 10, 2008, the, wall, street, journal, editorial, promoted, the, danish, mortgage, market, model, mortgages, in, malaysia, can, be, categorised, into, two, different, groups, conventional, home, loan, and, islamic, home, loan, under, the, conventional, home, loan, banks, normally, charge, a, fixed, interest, rate, a, variable, interest, rate, or, both, these, interest, rates, are, tied, to, a, base, rate, individual, bank, s, benchmark, rate, for, islamic, home, financing, it, follows, the, sharia, law, and, comes, in, 2, common, types, bai, bithaman, ajil, bba, or, musharakah, mutanaqisah, mm, bai, bithaman, ajil, is, when, the, bank, buys, the, property, at, current, market, price, and, sells, it, back, to, you, at, a, much, higher, price, musharakah, mutanaqisah, is, when, the, bank, buys, the, property, together, with, you, you, will, then, slowly, buy, the, bank, s, portion, of, the, property, through, rental, whereby, a, portion, of, the, rental, goes, to, paying, for, the, purchase, of, a, part, of, the, bank, s, share, in, the, property, until, the, property, comes, to, your, complete, ownership, islamic, sharia, law, prohibits, the, payment, or, receipt, of, interest, meaning, that, muslims, cannot, use, conventional, mortgages, the, islamic, mortgage, loan, cancels, any, form, of, interest, because, of, doctrines, so, in, the, mortgage, loan, process, the, lender, and, the, borrower, are, more, like, a, capital, shared, partnership, than, a, debt, relationship, however, real, estate, is, far, too, expensive, for, most, people, to, buy, outright, using, cash, islamic, mortgages, solve, this, problem, by, having, the, property, change, hands, twice, in, one, variation, the, bank, will, buy, the, house, outright, and, then, act, as, a, landlord, the, homebuyer, in, addition, to, paying, rent, will, pay, a, contribution, towards, the, purchase, of, the, property, when, the, last, payment, is, made, the, property, changes, hands, typically, this, may, lead, to, a, higher, final, price, for, the, buyers, this, is, because, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, and, india, there, is, a, stamp, duty, which, is, a, tax, charged, by, the, government, on, a, change, of, ownership, because, ownership, changes, twice, in, an, islamic, mortgage, a, stamp, tax, may, be, charged, twice, many, other, jurisdictions, have, similar, transaction, taxes, on, change, of, ownership, which, may, be, levied, in, the, united, kingdom, the, dual, application, of, stamp, duty, in, such, transactions, was, removed, in, the, finance, act, 2003, in, order, to, facilitate, islamic, mortgages, an, alternative, scheme, involves, the, bank, reselling, the, property, according, to, an, installment, plan, at, a, price, higher, than, the, original, price, both, of, these, methods, compensate, the, lender, as, if, they, were, charging, interest, but, the, loans, are, structured, in, a, way, that, in, name, they, are, not, and, the, lender, shares, the, financial, risks, involved, in, the, transaction, with, the, homebuyer, mortgage, insurance, is, an, insurance, policy, designed, to, protect, the, mortgagee, lender, from, any, default, by, the, mortgagor, borrower, it, is, used, commonly, in, loans, with, a, loan, to, value, ratio, over, 80, and, employed, in, the, event, of, foreclosure, and, repossession, this, policy, is, typically, paid, for, by, the, borrower, as, a, component, to, final, nominal, note, rate, or, in, one, lump, sum, up, front, or, as, a, separate, and, itemized, component, of, monthly, mortgage, payment, in, the, last, case, mortgage, insurance, can, be, dropped, when, the, lender, informs, the, borrower, or, its, subsequent, assigns, that, the, property, has, appreciated, the, loan, has, been, paid, down, or, any, combination, of, both, to, relegate, the, loan, to, value, under, 80, in, the, event, of, repossession, banks, investors, etc, must, resort, to, selling, the, property, to, recoup, their, original, investment, the, money, lent, and, are, able, to, dispose, of, hard, assets, such, as, real, estate, more, quickly, by, reductions, in, price, therefore, the, mortgage, insurance, acts, as, a, hedge, should, the, repossessing, authority, recover, less, than, full, and, fair, market, value, for, any, hard, asset
