a, hunter, gatherer, or, forager, is, a, human, living, in, a, community, or, according, to, an, ancestrally, derived, lifestyle, in, which, most, or, all, food, is, obtained, by, foraging, that, is, by, gathering, food, from, local, naturally, occurring, sources, especially, wild, edible, plants, but, also, insects, fungi, honey, bird, eggs, or, anything, safe, to, eat, and, or, by, hunting, game, pursuing, and, or, trapping, and, killing, wild, animals, including, catching, fish, this, is, a, common, practice, among, most, vertebrates, that, are, omnivores, hunter, gatherer, societies, stand, in, contrast, to, the, more, sedentary, agricultural, societies, which, rely, mainly, on, cultivating, crops, and, raising, domesticated, animals, for, food, production, although, the, boundaries, between, the, two, ways, of, living, are, not, completely, distinct, hunting, and, gathering, was, humanity, s, original, and, most, enduring, successful, competitive, adaptation, in, the, natural, world, occupying, at, least, 90, percent, of, human, history, following, the, invention, of, agriculture, hunter, gatherers, who, did, not, change, were, displaced, or, conquered, by, farming, or, pastoralist, groups, in, most, parts, of, the, world, across, western, eurasia, it, was, not, until, approximately, 4, 000, bc, that, farming, and, metallurgical, societies, completely, replaced, hunter, gatherers, these, technologically, advanced, societies, expanded, faster, in, areas, with, less, forest, pushing, hunter, gatherers, into, denser, woodlands, only, the, middle, late, bronze, age, and, iron, age, societies, were, able, to, fully, replace, hunter, gatherers, in, their, final, stronghold, located, in, the, most, densely, forested, areas, unlike, their, bronze, and, iron, age, counterparts, neolithic, societies, could, not, establish, themselves, in, dense, forests, and, copper, age, societies, had, only, limited, success, in, addition, to, men, a, single, study, found, that, women, engage, in, hunting, in, 79, of, modern, hunter, gatherer, societies, however, an, attempted, verification, of, this, study, found, that, multiple, methodological, failures, all, bias, their, results, in, the, same, direction, their, analysis, does, not, contradict, the, wide, body, of, empirical, evidence, for, gendered, divisions, of, labor, in, foraging, societies, only, a, few, contemporary, societies, of, uncontacted, people, are, still, classified, as, hunter, gatherers, and, many, supplement, their, foraging, activity, with, horticulture, or, pastoralism, hunting, and, gathering, was, presumably, the, subsistence, strategy, employed, by, human, societies, beginning, some, 1, 8, million, years, ago, by, homo, erectus, and, from, its, appearance, some, 200, 000, years, ago, by, homo, sapiens, prehistoric, hunter, gatherers, lived, in, groups, that, consisted, of, several, families, resulting, in, a, size, of, a, few, dozen, people, it, remained, the, only, mode, of, subsistence, until, the, end, of, the, mesolithic, period, some, 10, 000, years, ago, and, after, this, was, replaced, only, gradually, with, the, spread, of, the, neolithic, revolution, the, late, pleistocene, witnessed, the, spread, of, modern, humans, outside, of, africa, as, well, as, the, extinction, of, all, other, human, species, humans, spread, to, the, australian, continent, and, the, americas, for, the, first, time, coincident, with, the, extinction, of, numerous, predominantly, megafaunal, species, major, extinctions, were, incurred, in, australia, beginning, approximately, 50, 000, years, ago, and, in, the, americas, about, 15, 000, years, ago, ancient, north, eurasians, lived, in, extreme, conditions, of, the, mammoth, steppes, of, siberia, and, survived, by, hunting, mammoths, bison, and, woolly, rhinoceroses, the, settlement, of, the, americas, began, when, paleolithic, hunter, gatherers, entered, north, america, from, the, north, asian, mammoth, steppe, via, the, beringia, land, bridge, during, the, 1970s, lewis, binford, suggested, that, early, humans, obtained, food, via, scavenging, not, hunting, early, humans, in, the, lower, paleolithic, lived, in, forests, and, woodlands, which, allowed, them, to, collect, seafood, eggs, nuts, and, fruits, besides, scavenging, rather, than, killing, large, animals, for, meat, according, to, this, view, they, used, carcasses, of, such, animals, that, had, either, been, killed, by, predators, or, that, had, died, of, natural, causes, scientists, have, demonstrated, that, the, evidence, for, early, human, behaviors, for, hunting, versus, carcass, scavenging, vary, based, on, the, ecology, including, the, types, of, predators, that, existed, and, the, environment, according, to, the, endurance, running, hypothesis, long, distance, running, as, in, persistence, hunting, a, method, still, practiced, by, some, hunter, gatherer, groups, in, modern, times, was, likely, the, driving, evolutionary, force, leading, to, the, evolution, of, certain, human, characteristics, this, hypothesis, does, not, necessarily, contradict, the, scavenging, hypothesis, both, subsistence, strategies, may, have, been, in, use, sequentially, alternately, or, even, simultaneously, starting, at, the, transition, between, the, middle, to, upper, paleolithic, period, some, 80, 000, to, 70, 000, years, ago, some, hunter, gatherer, bands, began, to, specialize, concentrating, on, hunting, a, smaller, selection, of, often, larger, game, and, gathering, a, smaller, selection, of, food, this, specialization, of, work, also, involved, creating, specialized, tools, such, as, fishing, nets, hooks, and, bone, harpoons, the, transition, into, the, subsequent, neolithic, period, is, chiefly, defined, by, the, unprecedented, development, of, nascent, agricultural, practices, agriculture, originated, as, early, as, 12, 000, years, ago, in, the, middle, east, and, also, independently, originated, in, many, other, areas, including, southeast, asia, parts, of, africa, mesoamerica, and, the, andes, forest, gardening, was, also, being, used, as, a, food, production, system, in, various, parts, of, the, world, over, this, period, many, groups, continued, their, hunter, gatherer, ways, of, life, although, their, numbers, have, continually, declined, partly, as, a, result, of, pressure, from, growing, agricultural, and, pastoral, communities, many, of, them, reside, in, the, developing, world, either, in, arid, regions, or, tropical, forests, areas, that, were, formerly, available, to, hunter, gatherers, were, and, continue, to, be, encroached, upon, by, the, settlements, of, agriculturalists, in, the, resulting, competition, for, land, use, hunter, gatherer, societies, either, adopted, these, practices, or, moved, to, other, areas, in, addition, jared, diamond, has, blamed, a, decline, in, the, availability, of, wild, foods, particularly, animal, resources, in, north, and, south, america, for, example, most, large, mammal, species, had, gone, extinct, by, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, according, to, diamond, because, of, overexploitation, by, humans, one, of, several, explanations, offered, for, the, quaternary, extinction, event, there, as, the, number, and, size, of, agricultural, societies, increased, they, expanded, into, lands, traditionally, used, by, hunter, gatherers, this, process, of, agriculture, driven, expansion, led, to, the, development, of, the, first, forms, of, government, in, agricultural, centers, such, as, the, fertile, crescent, ancient, india, ancient, china, olmec, sub, saharan, africa, and, norte, chico, as, a, result, of, the, now, near, universal, human, reliance, upon, agriculture, the, few, contemporary, hunter, gatherer, cultures, usually, live, in, areas, unsuitable, for, agricultural, use, archaeologists, can, use, evidence, such, as, stone, tool, use, to, track, hunter, gatherer, activities, including, mobility, ethnobotany, is, the, field, of, study, whereby, food, plants, of, various, peoples, and, tribes, worldwide, are, documented, most, hunter, gatherers, are, nomadic, or, semi, nomadic, and, live, in, temporary, settlements, mobile, communities, typically, construct, shelters, using, impermanent, building, materials, or, they, may, use, natural, rock, shelters, where, they, are, available, some, hunter, gatherer, cultures, such, as, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, and, the, yokuts, lived, in, particularly, rich, environments, that, allowed, them, to, be, sedentary, or, semi, sedentary, amongst, the, earliest, example, of, permanent, settlements, is, the, osipovka, culture, 14, 10, 3, thousand, years, ago, which, lived, in, a, fish, rich, environment, that, allowed, them, to, be, able, to, stay, at, the, same, place, all, year, one, group, the, chumash, had, the, highest, recorded, population, density, of, any, known, hunter, and, gatherer, society, with, an, estimated, 21, 6, persons, per, square, mile, hunter, gatherers, tend, to, have, an, egalitarian, social, ethos, although, settled, hunter, gatherers, for, example, those, inhabiting, the, northwest, coast, of, north, america, and, the, calusa, in, florida, are, an, exception, to, this, rule, for, example, the, san, people, or, bushmen, of, southern, africa, have, social, customs, that, strongly, discourage, hoarding, and, displays, of, authority, and, encourage, economic, equality, via, sharing, of, food, and, material, goods, karl, marx, defined, this, socio, economic, system, as, primitive, communism, the, egalitarianism, typical, of, human, hunters, and, gatherers, is, never, total, but, is, striking, when, viewed, in, an, evolutionary, context, one, of, humanity, s, two, closest, primate, relatives, chimpanzees, are, anything, but, egalitarian, forming, themselves, into, hierarchies, that, are, often, dominated, by, an, alpha, male, so, great, is, the, contrast, with, human, hunter, gatherers, that, it, is, widely, argued, by, paleoanthropologists, that, resistance, to, being, dominated, was, a, key, factor, driving, the, evolutionary, emergence, of, human, consciousness, language, kinship, and, social, organization, most, anthropologists, believe, that, hunter, gatherers, do, not, have, permanent, leaders, instead, the, person, taking, the, initiative, at, any, one, time, depends, on, the, task, being, performed, within, a, particular, tribe, or, people, hunter, gatherers, are, connected, by, both, kinship, and, band, residence, domestic, group, membership, postmarital, residence, among, hunter, gatherers, tends, to, be, matrilocal, at, least, initially, young, mothers, can, enjoy, childcare, support, from, their, own, mothers, who, continue, living, nearby, in, the, same, camp, the, systems, of, kinship, and, descent, among, human, hunter, gatherers, were, relatively, flexible, although, there, is, evidence, that, early, human, kinship, in, general, tended, to, be, matrilineal, the, conventional, assumption, has, been, that, women, did, most, of, the, gathering, while, men, concentrated, on, big, game, hunting, an, illustrative, account, is, megan, biesele, s, study, of, the, southern, african, ju, hoan, women, like, meat, a, recent, study, suggests, that, the, sexual, division, of, labor, was, the, fundamental, organizational, innovation, that, gave, homo, sapiens, the, edge, over, the, neanderthals, allowing, our, ancestors, to, migrate, from, africa, and, spread, across, the, globe, a, 1986, study, found, most, hunter, gatherers, have, a, symbolically, structured, sexual, division, of, labor, however, it, is, true, that, in, a, small, minority, of, cases, women, hunted, the, same, kind, of, quarry, as, men, sometimes, doing, so, alongside, men, among, the, ju, hoansi, people, of, namibia, women, help, men, track, down, quarry, in, the, australian, martu, both, women, and, men, participate, in, hunting, but, with, a, different, style, of, gendered, division, while, men, are, willing, to, take, more, risks, to, hunt, bigger, animals, such, as, kangaroo, for, political, gain, as, a, form, of, competitive, magnanimity, women, target, smaller, game, such, as, lizards, to, feed, their, children, and, promote, working, relationships, with, other, women, preferring, a, more, constant, supply, of, sustenance, in, 2018, 9000, year, old, remains, of, a, female, hunter, along, with, a, toolkit, of, projectile, points, and, animal, processing, implements, were, discovered, at, the, andean, site, of, wilamaya, patjxa, puno, district, in, peru, a, 2020, study, inspired, by, this, discovery, found, that, of, 27, identified, burials, with, hunter, gatherers, of, a, known, sex, who, were, also, buried, with, hunting, tools, 11, were, female, hunter, gatherers, while, 16, were, male, hunter, gatherers, combined, with, uncertainties, these, findings, suggest, that, anywhere, from, 30, to, 50, percent, of, big, game, hunters, were, female, a, 2023, study, that, looked, at, studies, of, contemporary, hunter, gatherer, societies, from, the, 1800s, to, the, present, day, found, that, women, hunted, in, 79, percent, of, hunter, gatherer, societies, however, an, attempted, verification, of, this, study, found, that, multiple, methodological, failures, all, bias, their, results, in, the, same, direction, their, analysis, does, not, contradict, the, wide, body, of, empirical, evidence, for, gendered, divisions, of, labor, in, foraging, societies, at, the, 1966, man, the, hunter, conference, anthropologists, richard, borshay, lee, and, irven, devore, suggested, that, egalitarianism, was, one, of, several, central, characteristics, of, nomadic, hunting, and, gathering, societies, because, mobility, requires, minimization, of, material, possessions, throughout, a, population, therefore, no, surplus, of, resources, can, be, accumulated, by, any, single, member, other, characteristics, lee, and, devore, proposed, were, flux, in, territorial, boundaries, as, well, as, in, demographic, composition, at, the, same, conference, marshall, sahlins, presented, a, paper, entitled, notes, on, the, original, affluent, society, in, which, he, challenged, the, popular, view, of, hunter, gatherers, lives, as, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, as, thomas, hobbes, had, put, it, in, 1651, according, to, sahlins, ethnographic, data, indicated, that, hunter, gatherers, worked, far, fewer, hours, and, enjoyed, more, leisure, than, typical, members, of, industrial, society, and, they, still, ate, well, their, affluence, came, from, the, idea, that, they, were, satisfied, with, very, little, in, the, material, sense, later, in, 1996, ross, sackett, performed, two, distinct, meta, analyses, to, empirically, test, sahlin, s, view, the, first, of, these, studies, looked, at, 102, time, allocation, studies, and, the, second, one, analyzed, 207, energy, expenditure, studies, sackett, found, that, adults, in, foraging, and, horticultural, societies, work, on, average, about, 6, 5, hours, a, day, whereas, people, in, agricultural, and, industrial, societies, work, on, average, 8, 8, hours, a, day, sahlins, theory, has, been, criticized, for, only, including, time, spent, hunting, and, gathering, while, omitting, time, spent, on, collecting, firewood, food, preparation, etc, other, scholars, also, assert, that, hunter, gatherer, societies, were, not, affluent, but, suffered, from, extremely, high, infant, mortality, frequent, disease, and, perennial, warfare, researchers, gurven, and, kaplan, have, estimated, that, around, 57, of, hunter, gatherers, reach, the, age, of, 15, of, those, that, reach, 15, years, of, age, 64, continue, to, live, to, or, past, the, age, of, 45, this, places, the, life, expectancy, between, 21, and, 37, years, they, further, estimate, that, 70, of, deaths, are, due, to, diseases, of, some, kind, 20, of, deaths, come, from, violence, or, accidents, and, 10, are, due, to, degenerative, diseases, mutual, exchange, and, sharing, of, resources, i, e, meat, gained, from, hunting, are, important, in, the, economic, systems, of, hunter, gatherer, societies, therefore, these, societies, can, be, described, as, based, on, a, gift, economy, a, 2010, paper, argued, that, while, hunter, gatherers, may, have, lower, levels, of, inequality, than, modern, industrialised, societies, that, does, not, mean, inequality, does, not, exist, the, researchers, estimated, that, the, average, gini, coefficient, amongst, hunter, gatherers, was, 0, 25, equivalent, to, the, country, of, denmark, in, 2007, in, addition, wealth, transmission, across, generations, was, also, a, feature, of, hunter, gatherers, meaning, that, wealthy, hunter, gatherers, within, the, context, of, their, communities, were, more, likely, to, have, children, as, wealthy, as, them, than, poorer, members, of, their, community, and, indeed, hunter, gatherer, societies, demonstrate, an, understanding, of, social, stratification, thus, while, the, researchers, agreed, that, hunter, gatherers, were, more, egalitarian, than, modern, societies, prior, characterisations, of, them, living, in, a, state, of, egalitarian, primitive, communism, were, inaccurate, and, misleading, this, study, however, exclusively, examined, modern, hunter, gatherer, communities, offering, limited, insight, into, the, exact, nature, of, social, structures, that, existed, prior, to, the, neolithic, revolution, alain, testart, and, others, have, said, that, anthropologists, should, be, careful, when, using, research, on, current, hunter, gatherer, societies, to, determine, the, structure, of, societies, in, the, paleolithic, era, emphasising, cross, cultural, influences, progress, and, development, that, such, societies, have, undergone, in, the, past, 10, 000, years, as, such, the, combined, anthropological, and, archaeological, evidence, to, date, continues, to, favour, previous, understandings, of, early, hunter, gatherers, as, largely, egalitarian, as, one, moves, away, from, the, equator, the, importance, of, plant, food, decreases, and, the, importance, of, aquatic, food, increases, in, cold, and, heavily, forested, environments, edible, plant, foods, and, large, game, are, less, abundant, and, hunter, gatherers, may, turn, to, aquatic, resources, to, compensate, hunter, gatherers, in, cold, climates, also, rely, more, on, stored, food, than, those, in, warm, climates, however, aquatic, resources, tend, to, be, costly, requiring, boats, and, fishing, technology, and, this, may, have, impeded, their, intensive, use, in, prehistory, marine, food, probably, did, not, start, becoming, prominent, in, the, diet, until, relatively, recently, during, the, late, stone, age, in, southern, africa, and, the, upper, paleolithic, in, europe, fat, is, important, in, assessing, the, quality, of, game, among, hunter, gatherers, to, the, point, that, lean, animals, are, often, considered, secondary, resources, or, even, starvation, food, consuming, too, much, lean, meat, leads, to, adverse, health, effects, like, protein, poisoning, and, can, in, extreme, cases, lead, to, death, additionally, a, diet, high, in, protein, and, low, in, other, macronutrients, results, in, the, body, using, the, protein, as, energy, possibly, leading, to, protein, deficiency, lean, meat, especially, becomes, a, problem, when, animals, go, through, a, lean, season, that, requires, them, to, metabolize, fat, deposits, in, areas, where, plant, and, fish, resources, are, scarce, hunter, gatherers, may, trade, meat, with, horticulturalists, for, carbohydrates, for, example, tropical, hunter, gatherers, may, have, an, excess, of, protein, but, be, deficient, in, carbohydrates, and, conversely, tropical, horticulturalists, may, have, a, surplus, of, carbohydrates, but, inadequate, protein, trading, may, thus, be, the, most, cost, effective, means, of, acquiring, carbohydrate, resources, hunter, gatherer, societies, manifest, significant, variability, depending, on, climate, zone, life, zone, available, technology, and, societal, structure, archaeologists, examine, hunter, gatherer, tool, kits, to, measure, variability, across, different, groups, collard, et, al, 2005, found, temperature, to, be, the, only, statistically, significant, factor, to, impact, hunter, gatherer, tool, kits, using, temperature, as, a, proxy, for, risk, collard, et, al, s, results, suggest, that, environments, with, extreme, temperatures, pose, a, threat, to, hunter, gatherer, systems, significant, enough, to, warrant, increased, variability, of, tools, these, results, support, torrence, s, 1989, theory, that, the, risk, of, failure, is, indeed, the, most, important, factor, in, determining, the, structure, of, hunter, gatherer, toolkits, one, way, to, divide, hunter, gatherer, groups, is, by, their, return, systems, james, woodburn, uses, the, categories, immediate, return, hunter, gatherers, for, egalitarianism, and, delayed, return, for, nonegalitarian, immediate, return, foragers, consume, their, food, within, a, day, or, two, after, they, procure, it, delayed, return, foragers, store, the, surplus, food, hunting, gathering, was, the, common, human, mode, of, subsistence, throughout, the, paleolithic, but, the, observation, of, current, day, hunters, and, gatherers, does, not, necessarily, reflect, paleolithic, societies, the, hunter, gatherer, cultures, examined, today, have, had, much, contact, with, modern, civilization, and, do, not, represent, pristine, conditions, found, in, uncontacted, peoples, the, transition, from, hunting, and, gathering, to, agriculture, is, not, necessarily, a, one, way, process, it, has, been, argued, that, hunting, and, gathering, represents, an, adaptive, strategy, which, may, still, be, exploited, if, necessary, when, environmental, change, causes, extreme, food, stress, for, agriculturalists, in, fact, it, is, sometimes, difficult, to, draw, a, clear, line, between, agricultural, and, hunter, gatherer, societies, especially, since, the, widespread, adoption, of, agriculture, and, resulting, cultural, diffusion, that, has, occurred, in, the, last, 10, 000, years, nowadays, some, scholars, speak, about, the, existence, within, cultural, evolution, of, the, so, called, mixed, economies, or, dual, economies, which, imply, a, combination, of, food, procurement, gathering, and, hunting, and, food, production, or, when, foragers, have, trade, relations, with, farmers, some, of, the, theorists, who, advocate, this, revisionist, critique, imply, that, because, the, pure, hunter, gatherer, disappeared, not, long, after, colonial, or, even, agricultural, contact, began, nothing, meaningful, can, be, learned, about, prehistoric, hunter, gatherers, from, studies, of, modern, ones, kelly, 24, 29, see, wilmsen, lee, and, guenther, have, rejected, most, of, the, arguments, put, forward, by, wilmsen, doron, shultziner, and, others, have, argued, that, we, can, learn, a, lot, about, the, life, styles, of, prehistoric, hunter, gatherers, from, studies, of, contemporary, hunter, gatherers, especially, their, impressive, levels, of, egalitarianism, there, are, nevertheless, a, number, of, contemporary, hunter, gatherer, peoples, who, after, contact, with, other, societies, continue, their, ways, of, life, with, very, little, external, influence, or, with, modifications, that, perpetuate, the, viability, of, hunting, and, gathering, in, the, 21st, century, one, such, group, is, the, pila, nguru, spinifex, people, of, western, australia, whose, land, in, the, great, victoria, desert, has, proved, unsuitable, for, european, agriculture, and, even, pastoralism, another, are, the, sentinelese, of, the, andaman, islands, in, the, indian, ocean, who, live, on, north, sentinel, island, and, to, date, have, maintained, their, independent, existence, repelling, attempts, to, engage, with, and, contact, them, the, savanna, pum, of, venezuela, also, live, in, an, area, that, is, inhospitable, to, large, scale, economic, exploitation, and, maintain, their, subsistence, based, on, hunting, and, gathering, as, well, as, incorporating, a, small, amount, of, manioc, horticulture, that, supplements, but, is, not, replacing, reliance, on, foraged, foods, evidence, suggests, big, game, hunter, gatherers, crossed, the, bering, strait, from, asia, eurasia, into, north, america, over, a, land, bridge, beringia, that, existed, between, 47, 000, and, 14, 000, years, ago, around, 18, 500, 15, 500, years, ago, these, hunter, gatherers, are, believed, to, have, followed, herds, of, now, extinct, pleistocene, megafauna, along, ice, free, corridors, that, stretched, between, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, another, route, proposed, is, that, either, on, foot, or, using, primitive, boats, they, migrated, down, the, pacific, coast, to, south, america, hunter, gatherers, would, eventually, flourish, all, over, the, americas, primarily, based, in, the, great, plains, of, the, united, states, and, canada, with, offshoots, as, far, east, as, the, gasp, peninsula, on, the, atlantic, coast, and, as, far, south, as, chile, monte, verde, american, hunter, gatherers, were, spread, over, a, wide, geographical, area, thus, there, were, regional, variations, in, lifestyles, however, all, the, individual, groups, shared, a, common, style, of, stone, tool, production, making, knapping, styles, and, progress, identifiable, this, early, paleo, indian, period, lithic, reduction, tool, adaptations, have, been, found, across, the, americas, utilized, by, highly, mobile, bands, consisting, of, approximately, 25, to, 50, members, of, an, extended, family, the, archaic, period, in, the, americas, saw, a, changing, environment, featuring, a, warmer, more, arid, climate, and, the, disappearance, of, the, last, megafauna, the, majority, of, population, groups, at, this, time, were, still, highly, mobile, hunter, gatherers, individual, groups, started, to, focus, on, resources, available, to, them, locally, however, and, thus, archaeologists, have, identified, a, pattern, of, increasing, regional, generalization, as, seen, with, the, southwest, arctic, poverty, point, dalton, and, plano, traditions, these, regional, adaptations, would, become, the, norm, with, reliance, less, on, hunting, and, gathering, with, a, more, mixed, economy, of, small, game, fish, seasonally, wild, vegetables, and, harvested, plant, foods, scholars, like, kat, anderson, have, suggested, that, the, term, hunter, gatherer, is, reductive, because, it, implies, that, native, americans, never, stayed, in, one, place, long, enough, to, affect, the, environment, around, them, however, many, of, the, landscapes, in, the, americas, today, are, due, to, the, way, the, natives, of, that, area, originally, tended, the, land, anderson, specifically, looks, at, california, natives, and, the, practices, they, utilized, to, tame, their, land, some, of, these, practices, included, pruning, weeding, sowing, burning, and, selective, harvesting, these, practices, allowed, them, to, take, from, the, environment, in, a, sustainable, manner, for, centuries, california, indians, view, the, idea, of, wilderness, in, a, negative, light, they, believe, that, wilderness, is, the, result, of, humans, losing, their, knowledge, of, the, natural, world, and, how, to, care, for, it, when, the, earth, turns, back, to, wilderness, after, the, connection, with, humans, is, lost, then, the, plants, and, animals, will, retreat, and, hide, from, the, humans
