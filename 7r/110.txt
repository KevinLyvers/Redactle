a, domestic, worker, is, a, person, who, works, within, a, residence, and, performs, a, variety, of, household, services, for, an, individual, from, providing, cleaning, and, household, maintenance, or, cooking, laundry, and, ironing, or, care, for, children, and, elderly, dependents, and, other, household, errands, the, term, domestic, service, applies, to, the, equivalent, occupational, category, in, traditional, english, contexts, such, a, person, was, said, to, be, in, service, some, domestic, workers, live, within, their, employer, s, household, in, some, cases, the, contribution, and, skill, of, servants, whose, work, encompassed, complex, management, tasks, in, large, households, have, been, highly, valued, however, for, the, most, part, domestic, work, tends, to, be, demanding, and, is, commonly, considered, to, be, undervalued, despite, often, being, necessary, although, legislation, protecting, domestic, workers, is, in, place, in, many, countries, it, is, often, not, extensively, enforced, in, many, jurisdictions, domestic, work, is, poorly, regulated, and, domestic, workers, are, subject, to, serious, abuses, including, slavery, servant, is, an, older, english, word, for, domestic, worker, though, not, all, servants, worked, inside, the, home, domestic, service, or, the, employment, of, people, for, wages, in, their, employer, s, residence, was, sometimes, simply, called, service, and, has, often, been, part, of, a, hierarchical, system, in, britain, a, highly, developed, system, of, domestic, service, peaked, towards, the, close, of, the, victorian, era, a, period, known, in, the, united, states, as, the, gilded, age, and, in, france, as, the, belle, poque, perhaps, reaching, its, most, complicated, and, rigidly, structured, state, during, the, edwardian, period, which, reflected, the, limited, social, mobility, before, world, war, i, in, 2015, the, international, labour, organization, ilo, based, on, national, surveys, or, censuses, of, 232, countries, and, territories, estimated, the, number, of, domestic, workers, at, 67, 1, million, but, the, ilo, itself, states, that, experts, say, that, due, to, the, fact, that, this, kind, of, work, is, often, hidden, and, unregistered, the, total, number, of, domestic, workers, could, be, as, high, as, 100, million, the, ilo, also, states, that, 83, of, domestic, workers, are, women, and, many, are, migrant, workers, in, guatemala, it, is, estimated, that, 11, 8, percent, of, all, women, working, in, 2020, were, employed, as, domestic, workers, they, hardly, have, any, legal, protection, according, to, guatemalan, labor, law, domestic, work, is, not, subject, to, schedules, or, limitations, of, working, day, however, by, law, domestic, workers, are, still, entitled, to, ten, hours, of, free, time, in, 24, hours, and, an, additional, six, hours, off, on, sundays, but, very, often, these, minimal, employment, laws, are, disregarded, and, so, are, basic, civil, liberties, in, brazil, domestic, workers, must, be, hired, under, a, registered, contract, and, have, many, of, the, rights, of, any, other, workers, which, includes, a, minimum, wage, remunerated, vacations, and, a, remunerated, weekly, day, off, it, is, not, uncommon, however, for, employers, to, hire, servants, illegally, and, fail, to, offer, a, work, contract, since, domestic, staff, predominantly, come, from, disadvantaged, groups, with, less, access, to, education, they, are, often, vulnerable, and, uninformed, of, their, rights, especially, in, rural, areas, nevertheless, domestics, employed, without, a, proper, contract, can, successfully, sue, their, employers, and, be, compensated, for, abuse, committed, it, is, common, in, brazil, for, domestic, staff, including, childcare, staff, to, be, required, to, wear, uniforms, while, this, requirement, has, fallen, out, of, use, in, other, countries, in, the, united, states, domestic, workers, are, generally, excluded, from, many, of, the, legal, protections, afforded, to, other, classes, of, worker, including, the, provisions, of, the, national, labor, relations, act, however, in, recent, years, advocacy, groups, like, the, national, domestic, workers, alliance, have, succeeded, in, passing, a, domestic, worker, s, bill, of, rights, in, new, york, hawaii, california, and, illinois, traditionally, domestic, workers, have, mostly, been, women, and, are, likely, to, be, immigrants, currently, there, are, 1, 8, million, domestic, workers, and, tens, of, thousands, of, people, are, believed, to, be, in, forced, labor, in, the, united, states, america, s, domestic, home, help, workers, most, of, them, female, members, of, minority, groups, earn, low, wages, and, often, receive, no, retirement, or, health, benefits, because, of, the, lack, of, basic, labor, protections, domestic, workers, are, also, excluded, from, vacation, time, sick, time, and, overtime, and, only, thirteen, percent, of, domestic, workers, get, health, insurance, provided, by, their, employers, a, report, from, the, national, domestic, workers, alliance, and, affiliated, groups, found, that, nearly, a, quarter, of, nannies, caregivers, and, home, health, workers, make, less, than, the, minimum, wage, in, the, states, in, which, they, work, and, nearly, half, 48, percent, are, paid, less, than, needed, to, adequately, support, a, family, many, of, these, workers, are, subjected, to, abuse, sexual, harassment, and, social, inequality, however, because, domestic, workers, work, in, the, home, their, struggles, are, hidden, in, the, home, and, out, of, the, public, spotlight, nowadays, with, an, increase, of, power, the, domestic, workers, community, has, formed, many, organizations, such, as, the, national, domestic, workers, alliance, domestic, workers, united, and, the, south, african, domestic, service, and, allied, workers, union, the, domestic, work, industry, is, dominated, throughout, the, world, by, women, while, the, domestic, work, industry, is, advantageous, for, women, in, that, it, provides, them, a, sector, that, they, have, substantial, access, to, it, can, also, prove, to, be, disadvantageous, by, reinforcing, gender, inequality, through, the, idea, that, domestic, work, is, an, industry, that, should, be, dominated, by, women, within, the, domestic, work, industry, the, much, smaller, proportion, of, jobs, that, is, occupied, by, men, are, not, the, same, jobs, that, are, typically, occupied, by, women, within, the, childcare, industry, men, make, up, only, about, 3, 6, of, all, workers, additionally, in, the, child, care, industry, men, are, more, likely, to, fill, roles, that, are, not, domestic, in, nature, but, administrative, such, as, a, managerial, role, in, a, daycare, center, while, the, domestic, work, industry, was, once, believed, to, be, an, industry, that, belonged, to, a, past, type, of, society, and, did, not, belong, in, a, modern, world, trends, are, showing, that, although, elements, of, the, domestic, work, industry, have, been, changing, the, industry, itself, has, shown, no, signs, of, fading, away, but, only, signs, of, transformation, there, are, several, specific, causes, that, are, credited, to, continuing, the, cycle, of, the, demand, for, domestic, work, one, of, these, causes, is, that, with, more, women, taking, up, full, time, jobs, a, dually, employed, household, with, children, places, a, heavy, burden, on, parents, it, is, argued, however, that, this, burden, would, not, result, in, the, demand, for, outside, domestic, work, if, men, and, women, were, providing, equal, levels, of, effort, in, domestic, work, and, child, rearing, within, their, own, home, the, demand, for, domestic, workers, has, also, become, primarily, fulfilled, by, migrant, domestic, workers, from, other, countries, who, flock, to, wealthier, nations, to, fulfill, the, demand, for, help, at, home, this, trend, of, domestic, workers, flowing, from, poorer, nations, to, richer, nations, creates, a, relationship, that, on, some, levels, encourages, the, liberation, of, one, group, of, people, at, the, expense, of, the, exploitation, of, another, although, domestic, work, has, far, from, begun, to, fade, from, society, the, demand, for, it, and, the, people, who, fill, that, demand, has, changed, drastically, over, time, the, so, called, servant, problem, in, such, countries, as, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, and, canada, was, the, problem, that, middle, class, families, had, with, cleaning, cooking, and, especially, entertaining, at, the, level, that, was, socially, expected, it, was, too, much, work, for, any, one, person, to, do, herself, but, middle, class, families, unlike, wealthy, families, could, not, afford, to, pay, the, wages, necessary, to, attract, and, retain, skilled, household, employees, the, united, kingdom, s, master, and, servant, act, 1823, was, the, first, of, its, kind, the, terms, referred, generally, to, employers, and, employees, the, act, influenced, the, creation, of, domestic, service, laws, in, other, nations, although, legislation, tended, to, favour, employers, however, before, the, passing, of, such, acts, servants, and, workers, in, general, had, no, protection, in, law, the, only, real, advantage, that, domestic, service, provided, was, the, provision, of, meals, accommodation, and, sometimes, clothes, in, addition, to, a, modest, wage, service, was, normally, an, apprentice, system, with, room, for, advancement, through, the, ranks, the, conditions, faced, by, domestic, workers, have, varied, considerably, throughout, history, and, in, the, contemporary, world, in, the, course, of, twentieth, century, movements, for, labour, rights, women, s, rights, and, immigrant, rights, the, conditions, faced, by, domestic, workers, and, the, problems, specific, to, their, class, of, employment, have, come, to, the, fore, in, 2011, the, international, labour, organization, adopted, the, convention, concerning, decent, work, for, domestic, workers, previously, at, its, 301st, session, march, 2008, the, international, labour, organization, ilo, governing, body, agreed, to, place, an, item, on, decent, work, for, domestic, workers, on, the, agenda, of, the, 99th, session, of, the, international, labour, conference, 2010, with, a, view, to, the, setting, of, labour, standards, in, july, 2011, at, the, annual, international, labour, conference, held, by, the, ilo, conference, delegates, adopted, the, convention, on, domestic, workers, by, a, vote, of, 396, to, 16, with, 63, abstentions, the, convention, recognized, domestic, workers, as, workers, with, the, same, rights, as, other, workers, on, 26, april, 2012, uruguay, was, the, first, country, to, ratify, the, convention, many, domestic, workers, are, live, in, domestics, though, they, often, have, their, own, quarters, their, accommodations, are, not, usually, as, comfortable, as, those, reserved, for, the, family, members, in, some, cases, they, sleep, in, the, kitchen, or, small, rooms, such, as, a, box, room, sometimes, located, in, the, basement, or, attic, domestic, workers, may, live, in, their, own, home, though, more, often, they, are, live, in, domestics, meaning, that, they, receive, their, room, and, board, as, part, of, their, salaries, in, some, countries, because, of, the, large, gap, between, urban, and, rural, incomes, and, the, lack, of, employment, opportunities, in, the, countryside, even, an, ordinary, middle, class, urban, family, can, afford, to, employ, a, full, time, live, in, servant, the, majority, of, domestic, workers, in, china, mexico, india, and, other, populous, developing, countries, are, people, from, the, rural, areas, who, are, employed, by, urban, families, employers, may, require, their, domestic, workers, to, wear, a, uniform, livery, or, other, domestic, workers,

would, wear, something, from, a, simple, suit, or, a, white, dress, shirt, often, with, tie, and, knickers, in, traditional, portrayals, the, attire, of, domestic, workers, especially, was, typically, more, formal, and, conservative, than, that, of, those, whom, they, serve, for, example, in, films, of, the, early, 20th, century, a, butler, might, appear, in, a, tailcoat, while, male, family, members, and, guests, appeared, in, lounge, suits, or, sports, jackets, and, trousers, depending, on, the, occasion, in, later, portrayals, the, employer, and, guests, might, wear, casual, slacks, or, even, jeans, while, a, male, domestic, worker, wore, a, jacket, and, tie, or, a, white, dress, shirt, with, black, trousers, necktie, or, bowtie, maybe, even, a, waistcoat, or, a, female, domestic,

academics, as, situated, within, the, rapid, growth, of, paid, domestic, labor, the, feminization, of, transnational, migration, and, the, development, of, new, public, spheres, as, women, currently, dominate, the, domestic, labor, market, throughout, the, world, they, have, learned, to, navigate, the, system, of, domestic, work, both, in, their, own, countries, and, abroad, in, order, to, maximize, the, benefits, of, entering, the, domestic, labor, market, among, the, disadvantages, of, working, as, a, domestic, worker, is, the, fact, that, women, working, in, this, sector, are, working, in, an, area, often, regarded, as, a, private, sphere, feminist, critics, of, women, working, in, the, domestic, sphere, argue, that, this, woman, dominated, market, is, reinforcing, gender, inequalities, by, potentially, creating, mistress, servant, relationships, between, domestic, workers, and, their, employers, and, continuing, to, put, women, in, a, position, of, lesser, power, other, critics, point, out, that, working, in, a, privatized, sphere, robs, domestic, workers, of, the, advantages, of, more, socialized, work, in, the, public, sphere, additionally, domestic, laborers, face, other, disadvantages, their, isolation, is, increased, by, their, invisibility, in, the, public, sphere, and, the, repetitive, intangible, nature, of, their, work, decreases, its,

portrayed, these, roles, the, wealthy, in, the, city, would, also, have, domestic, workers, but, fewer, and, with, less, distinctive, roles, domestic, workers, were, mostly, considered, part, of, the, lower, class, and, some, middle, class, in, modern, times, migrant, domestic, workers, have, been, brought, in, to, the, uk, to, fill, the, demand, for, low, cost, workers, human, rights, groups, have, added, that, they, are, often, subject, to, abuse, in, the, united, states, slavery, legally, ended, in, 1865, however, the, freedmen, s, bureau, informed, the, former, slaves, now, classified, as, freedmen, and, women, that, they, could, either, sign, labor, contracts, with, white, planters, or, be, evicted, from, the, land, that, they, had, lived, on, most, freedmen, in, the, south, signed, labor, contracts, with, their, former, white, slave, owners, because, that, was, the, only, work, experience, they, had, with, limited, skills, and, illiteracy, many, men, turned, to, become, sharecroppers, whereas, the, majority, of, women, participated, in, domestic, work, not, only, were, they, not, qualified, for, other, jobs, but, they, were, denied, other, jobs, and, segregated, from, american, society, purely, based, on, the, color, of, their, skin, the, south, wanted, to, keep, segregation, alive, and, hence, passed, legislation, such, as, the, jim, crow, laws, post, civil, war, which, denied, african, americans, of, legal, equality, and, political, rights, these, laws, kept, many, african, americans, as, a, second, class, status, up, until, new, laws, ended, segregation, in, the, 1960s, up, until, the, mid, twentieth, century, domestic, work, was, a, prominent, source, of, income, for, many, women, of, different, ethnic, backgrounds, many, of, these, women, were, either, african, american, or, immigrants, more, specifically, the, post, civil, war, south, had, a, high, concentration, of, african, americans, working, as, domestic, workers, at, the, turn, of, the, nineteenth, century, there, was, also, a, high, concentration, of, african, americans, working, as, domestic, workers, in, the, north, many, african, american, women, migrated, to, the, north, for, better, work, opportunities, and, higher, wages, compared, to, their, employment, options, in, the, south, the, african, american, women, who, worked, as, domestic, workers, were, generally, treated, as, poor, childlike, beings, that, were, seen, as, victims, of, their, own, ignorance, of, living, in, communities, of, crime, and, other, societal, infringements, however, despite, the, stereotypes, labeled, upon, domestic, workers, these, women, still, settled, for, these, positions, because, the, only, occupations, that, were, open, to, african, american, women, before, world, war, i, were, domestic, services, it, was, necessary, they, worked, along, with, their, husbands, in, order, to, keep, their, families, financially, supported, frequently, underpaid, african, american, servants, commonly, took, food, scraps, and, discarded, clothing, from, their, employers, in, a, practice, known, as, pan, toting, or, the, service, pan, the, service, pan, augmented, wages, in, almost, two, thirds, of, the, employers, households, in, athens, georgia, in, 1913, the, pan, system, was, used, by, employers, to, justify, paying, a, lower, wage, and, used, by, domestic, workers, to, counter, their, employers, dishonesty, whites, also, pointed, to, the, practice, of, pan, toting, as, proof, that, a, negro, could, not, help, but, steal, thereby, reinforcing, stereotypes, of, black, inferiority, and, dependency, and, rationalizing, racist, paternalism, due, to, the, great, depression, many, domestic, workers, lost, their, jobs, this, is, because, many, white, families, lost, their, source, of, income, and, were, not, able, to, pay, domestic, workers, to, work, in, their, home, at, this, time, many, domestic, workers, relied, on, asking, strangers, on, the, street, for, housework, such, as, cleaning, they, house, jumped, looking, for, any, job, that, they, could, get, the, domestic, workforce, was, significantly, impacted, by, the, great, depression, which, caused, a, decrease, in, their, wages, and, an, intolerable, 18, hour, workday, also, agricultural, workers, and, the, african, american, women, working, as, domestic, workers, at, this, time, were, explicitly, excluded, from, social, security, and, the, fair, labor, standards, act, in, the, new, deal, legislation, domestic, workers, of, all, races, were, excluded, from, social, security, until, 1950, household, employees, working, at, least, two, days, a, week, for, the, same, person, were, added, to, social, security, coverage, in, 1950, along, with, nonprofit, workers, and, the, self, employed, hotel, workers, laundry, workers, all, agricultural, workers, and, state, and, local, government, employees, were, added, in, 1954, this, is, because, the, new, dealer, politicians, were, more, worried, about, losing, support, from, the, southern, democrats, in, congress, who, supported, segregation, rather, than, refusing, coverage, for, many, african, americans, unlike, their, white, counterparts, african, americans, did, not, form, labor, unions, because, they, lacked, the, resources, consciousness, and, the, access, to, networks, used, for, union, recruiting, on, top, of, that, the, domestic, workers, would, not, typically, have, earned, enough, money, to, be, able, to, afford, being, a, part, of, a, union, even, if, the, african, american, domestic, workers, wanted, to, advance, in, society, it, was, nearly, impossible, because, the, racial, structures, in, the, united, states, rarely, allowed, them, class, mobility, however, domestic, workers, that, were, white, such, as, the, irish, and, the, germans, utilized, working, in, middle, class, homes, to, their, advantage, working, in, the, middle, class, homes, served, to, americanize, allowing, the, workers, to, identify, more, with, their, employers, than, women, of, their, own, class, and, instilled, an, aspiration, to, become, middle, class, status, nearly, ninety, percent, of, african, american, women, worked, as, domestic, workers, during, the, civil, rights, movement, era, their, participation, in, the, civil, rights, movement, went, fairly, undocumented, despite, their, low, status, career, in, the, united, states, they, were, beneficial, for, the, betterment, of, society, and, the, status, of, the, african, american, race, it, has, been, noted, that, the, southern, african, american, women, were, the, backbone, of, the, civil, rights, movement, since, many, white, households, relied, on, the, african, american, domestic, workers, for, housework, the, workers, were, able, to, have, a, direct, impact, on, the, white, race, when, rebelling, for, their, civil, rights, the, african, american, domestic, workers, boycotted, buses, and, tried, to, register, to, vote, and, many, were, denied, and, imprisoned, however, the, domestic, workers, utilized, imprisonment, to, educate, other, african, american, women, on, the, civil, rights, movement, and, what, to, do, to, contribute, additionally, the, domestic, workers, frequently, rebelled, in, an, informal, manner, such, as, resisting, to, live, in, the, same, home, in, which, they, worked, by, doing, this, the, african, american, domestic, workers, transformed, the, domestic, services, and, collective, organizations, came, about, promoting, a, better, work, environment, for, african, american, domestic, workers, their, act, of, rebellion, gave, way, for, a, change, of, how, they, were, treated, how, they, were, paid, and, how, they, were, respected, the, following, is, a, list, of, known, domestic, workers, there, are, other, professions, that, work, and, may, live, in, the, household, but, are, not, considered, domestic, workers, as, they, would, not, be, housed, with, the, domestic, staff, professions, like, tutor, or, governess, secretary, librarian, private, chaplains, physician, personal, trainer, and, lady, s, companion, some, domestic, workers, have, become, notable, including, abdul, karim, the, munshi, servant, of, queen, victoria, of, the, united, kingdom, paul, burrell, butler, to, diana, princess, of, wales, moa, martinson, author, of, proletarian,
