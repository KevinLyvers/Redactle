originates, from, the, latin, rapere, supine, stem, raptum, to, snatch, to, grab, to, carry, off, in, roman, law, the, carrying, off, of, a, woman, by, force, with, or, without, intercourse, constituted, raptus, in, medieval, english, law, the, same, term, could, refer, to, either, kidnapping, or, rape, in, the, modern, sense, of, sexual, violation, the, original, meaning, of, carry, off, by, force, is, still, found, in, some, phrases, such, as, rape, and, pillage, or, in, titles, such, as, the, stories, of, the, rape, of, the, sabine, women, and, the, rape, of, europa, or, the, poem, the, rape, of, the, lock, which, is, about, the, theft, of, a, lock, of, hair, rape, is, defined, in, most, jurisdictions, as, sexual, intercourse, or, other, forms, of, sexual, penetration, committed, by, a, perpetrator, against, a, victim, without, their, consent, the, definition, of, rape, is, inconsistent, between, governmental, health, organizations, law, enforcement, health,

considered, rape, as, a, crime, that, required, coercion, or, force, or, threat, of, force, against, the, victim, or, a, third, person, until, 2012, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, fbi, considered, rape, a, crime, solely, committed, by, men, against, women, in, 2012, they, changed, their, definition, from, the, carnal, knowledge, of, a, female, forcibly, and, against, her, will, to, the, penetration, no, matter, how, slight, of, the, vagina, or, anus, with, any, body, part, or, object, or, oral, penetration, by, a, sex, organ, of, another, person, without, the, consent, of, the, victim, the, updated, definition, still, excluded, from, the, definition, of, rape, men, forced, to, penetrate, women, which, is, generally, recognized, as, the, academic, definition, of, rape, however, it, recognized, any, gender, of, victim, and, perpetrator, and, that, rape, with, an, object, can, be, as, traumatic, as, penile, vaginal, rape, the, bureau, further, describes, instances, when, the, victim, is, unable, to, give, consent, because, of, mental, or, physical, incapacity, it, recognizes, that, a, victim, can, be, incapacitated, by, drugs, and, alcohol, and, unable, to, give, valid, consent, the, definition, does, not, change, federal, or, state, criminal, codes, or, impact, charging, and, prosecution, on, the, federal, state, or, local, level, it, rather, means, that, rape, will, be, more, accurately, reported, nationwide, health, organizations, and, agencies, have, also, expanded, rape, beyond, traditional, definitions, the, world, health, organization, who, defines, rape, as, a, form, of, sexual, assault, while, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, includes, rape, in, their, definition, of, sexual, assault, they, term, rape, a, form, of, sexual, violence, the, cdc, lists, other, acts, of, coercive, non, consensual, sexual, activity, that, may, or, may, not, include, rape, including, drug, facilitated, sexual, assault, acts, in, which, a, victim, is, made, to, penetrate, a, perpetrator, or, someone, else, intoxication, where, the, victim, is, unable, to, consent, due, to, incapacitation, or, being, unconscious, non, physically, forced, penetration, which, occurs, after, a, person, is, pressured, verbally, by, intimidation, or, misuse, of, authority, to, force, to, consent, or, completed, or, attempted, forced, penetration, of, a, victim, via, unwanted, physical, force, including, using, a, weapon, or, threatening, to, use, a, weapon, the, veterans, health, administration, vha, has, implemented, universal,

united, states, code, 1720d, public, law, 108, 422, some, countries, or, jurisdictions, differentiate, between, rape, and, sexual, assault, by, defining, rape, as, involving, penile, penetration, of, the, vagina, or, solely, penetration, involving, the, penis, while, other, types, of, non, consensual, sexual, activity, are, called, sexual, assault, scotland, for, example, emphasizes, penile, penetration, requiring, that, the, sexual, assault, must, have, been, committed, by, use, of, a, penis, to, qualify, as, rape, the, 1998, international, criminal, tribunal, for, rwanda, defines, rape, as, a, physical, invasion, of, a, sexual, nature, committed, on, a, person, under, circumstances, which, are, coercive, in, other, cases, the, term, rape, has, been, phased, out, of, legal, use, in, favor, of, terms, such, as, sexual, assault, or, criminal, sexual, conduct, some, countries, criminalize, non, consensual, condom, removal, stealthing, where, one, partner, removes, or, intentionally, damages, their, condom, during, sex, without, telling, the, other, partner, the, rationale, is, that, consent, was, given, to, protected, sex, and, not, to, unprotected, sex, making, the, subsequent, act, non, consensual, and, therefore, illicit, for, such, cases, united, kingdom, switzerland, new, zealand, have, enacted, rape, convictions, while, australia, canada, germany, saw, convictions, for, sexual, assault, california, considers, it, sexual, battery, victims, of, rape, or, sexual, assault, come, from, a, wide, range, of, genders, ages, sexual, orientations, ethnicities, geographical, locations, cultures, and, degrees, of, impairment, or, disability, incidences, of, rape, are, classified, into, a, number, of, categories, and, they, may, describe, the, relationship, of, the, perpetrator, to, the, victim, and, the, context, of, the, sexual, assault, these, include, date, rape, gang, rape, marital, rape, incestual, rape, child, sexual, abuse, prison, rape, acquaintance, rape, war, rape, and, statutory, rape, forced, sexual, activity, can, be, committed, over, a, long, period, of, time, with, little, to, no, physical, injury, lack, of, consent, is, key, to, the, definition, of, rape, consent, is, affirmative, informed, approval, indicating, a, freely, given, agreement, to, sexual, activity, it, is, not, necessarily, expressed, verbally, and, may, instead, be, overtly, implied, from, actions, but, the, absence, of, objection, does, not, constitute, consent, lack, of, consent, may, result, from, either, forcible, compulsion, by, the, perpetrator, or, an, inability, to, consent, on, the, part, of, the, victim, such, as, people, who, are, asleep, intoxicated, or, otherwise, mentally, compromised, sexual, intercourse, with, a, person, below, the, age, of, consent, i, e, the, age, at, which, legal, competence, is, established, is, referred, to, as, statutory, rape, in, india, consensual, sex, given, on, the, false, promise, of, marriage, constitutes, rape, duress, is, the, situation, when, the, person, is, threatened, by, force, or, violence, and, may, result, in, the, absence, of, an, objection, to, sexual, activity, this, can, lead, to, the, presumption, of, consent, duress, may, be, actual, or, threatened, force, or, violence, against, the, victim, or, someone, close, to, the, victim, even, blackmail, may, constitute, duress, abuse, of, power, may, constitute, duress, for, instance, in, the, philippines, a, man, commits, rape, if, he, engages, in, sexual, intercourse, with, a, woman, by, means, of, fraudulent, machination, or, grave, abuse, of, authority, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, rwanda, in, its, landmark, 1998, judgment, used, a, definition, of, rape, that, did, not, use, the, word, consent, a, physical, invasion, of, a, sexual, nature, committed, on, a, person, under, circumstances, which, are, coercive, marital, rape, or, spousal, rape, is, non, consensual, sex, in, which, the, perpetrator, is, the, victim, s, spouse, it, is, a, form, of, partner, rape, domestic, violence, and, sexual, abuse, once, widely, accepted, or, ignored, by, law, marital, rape, is, now, denounced, by, international, conventions, and, is, increasingly, criminalized, still, in, many, countries, marital, rape, either, remains, legal, or, is, illegal, but, widely, tolerated, and, accepted, as, a, husband, s, prerogative, in, 2006, the, un, secretary, general, s, in, depth, study, on, all, forms, of, violence, against, women, stated, that, pg, 113, marital, rape, may, be, prosecuted, in, at, least, 104, states, of, these, 32, have, made, marital, rape, a, specific, criminal, offense, while, the, remaining, 74, do, not, exempt, marital, rape, from, general, rape, provisions, marital, rape, is, not, a, prosecutable, offense, in, at, least, 53, states, four, states, criminalize, marital, rape, only, when, the, spouses, are, judicially, separated, four, states, are, considering, legislation, that, would, allow, marital, rape, to, be, prosecuted, since, 2006, several, other, states, have, outlawed, marital, rape, for, example, thailand, in, 2007, in, the, us, the, criminalization, of, marital, rape, started, in, the, mid, 1970s, and, in, 1993, north, carolina, became, the, last, state, to, make, marital, rape, illegal, in, many, countries, it, is, not, clear, if, marital, rape, may, or, may, not, be, prosecuted, under, ordinary, rape, laws, in, the, absence, of, a, marital, rape, law, it, may, be, possible, to, bring, prosecution, for, acts, of, forced, sexual, intercourse, inside, marriage, by, prosecuting, through, the, use, of, other, criminal, offenses, such, as, assault, based, offenses, the, acts, of, violence, or, criminal, threat, that, were, used, to, obtain, submission, consent, may, be, complicated, by, law, language, context, culture, and, sexual, orientation, studies, have, shown, that, men, consistently, perceive, women, s, actions, as, more, sexual, than, they, intend, in, addition, verbalized, no, to, sex, may, be, interpreted, as, keep, trying, or, even, yes, by, offenders, some, may, believe, that, when, injuries, are, not, visible, the, woman, must, have, consented, if, a, man, solicits, sex, from, another, man, the, pursuer, may, be, regarded, as, virile, the, who, states, that, the, principal, factors, that, lead, to, the, perpetration, of, sexual, violence, against, women, including, rape, are, no, single, facet, explains, the, motivation, for, rape, the, underlying, motives, of, rapists, can, be, multi, faceted, several, factors, have, been, proposed, anger, power, sadism, sexual, gratification, or, evolutionary, proclivities, however, some, factors, have, significant, causal, evidence, supporting, them, american, clinical, psychologist, david, lisak, co, author, of, a, 2002, study, of, undetected, rapists, says, that, compared, with, non, rapists, both, undetected, and, convicted, rapists, are, measurably, more, angry, at, women, and, more, motivated, by, a, desire, to, dominate, and, control, them, are, more, impulsive, disinhibited, anti, social, hypermasculine, and, less, empathic, sexual, aggression, is, often, considered, a, masculine, identity, characteristic, of, manhood, in, some, male, groups, and, is, significantly, correlated, to, the, desire, to, be, held, higher, in, esteem, among, male, peers, sexually, aggressive, behavior, among, young, men, has, been, correlated, with, gang, or, group, membership, as, well, as, having, other, delinquent, peers, gang, rape, is, often, perceived, by, male, perpetrators, as, a, justified, method, of, discouraging, or, punishing, what, they, consider, as, immoral, behavior, among, women, for, example, wearing, short, skirts, or, visiting, bars, in, some, areas, in, papua, new, guinea, women, can, be, punished, by, public, gang, rape, usually, through, permission, by, elders, gang, rape, and, mass, rape, are, often, used, as, a, means, of, male, bonding, this, is, particularly, evident, among, soldiers, as, gang, rape, accounts, for, about, three, quarters, or, more, of, war, rape, while, gang, rape, accounts, for, less, than, a, quarter, of, rapes, during, peacetime, commanders, sometimes, push, recruits, to, rape, as, committing, rape, can, be, taboo, and, illegal, and, so, builds, loyalty, among, those, involved, rebel, groups, who, have, forced, recruitment, as, opposed, to, volunteer, recruits, are, more, involved, in, rape, as, it, is, believed, the, recruits, start, with, less, loyalty, to, the, group, in, papua, new, guinea, urban, gangs, such, as, raskol, gangs, often, require, new, members, to, rape, women, as, part, of, their, initiation, perpetrators, of, sex, trafficking, and, cybersex, trafficking, allow, or, carry, out, rape, for, financial, gain, and, or, sexual, gratification, rape, pornography, including, child, pornography, is, created, for, profit, and, other, reasons, there, have, been, instances, of, child, sexual, abuse, and, child, rape, videos, on, pornhub, one, metric, used, by, the, who, to, determine, the, severity, of, global, rates, of, coercive, forced, sexual, activity, was, the, question, have, you, ever, been, forced, to, have, sexual, intercourse, against, your, will, asking, this, question, produced, higher, positive, response, rates, than, being, asked, whether, they, had, ever, been, abused, or, raped, the, who, report, describes, the, consequences, of, sexual, abuse, frequently, victims, may, not, recognize, what, happened, to, them, was, rape, some, may, remain, in, denial, for, years, afterwards, confusion, over, whether, or, not, their, experience, constitutes, rape, is, typical, especially, for, victims, of, psychologically, coerced, rape, women, may, not, identify, their, victimization, as, rape, for, many, reasons, such, as, feelings, of, shame, embarrassment, non, uniform, legal, definitions, reluctance, to, define, the, friend, partner, as, a, rapist, or, because, they, have, internalized, victim, blaming, attitudes, the, public, often, perceives, these, behaviors, as, counterintuitive, and, therefore, as, evidence, of, a, dishonest, woman, victims, may, react, in, ways, they, did, not, anticipate, after, the, rape, they, may, be, uncomfortable, frustrated, with, and, not, understand, their, reactions, most, victims, respond, by, freezing, up, or, becoming, compliant, and, cooperative, during, the, rape, these, are, common, survival, responses, of, all, mammals, this, can, cause, confusion, for, others, and, the, person, assaulted, an, assumption, is, that, someone, being, raped, would, call, for, help, or, struggle, a, struggle, would, result, in, torn, clothes, or, injuries, dissociation, can, occur, during, the, assault, memories, may, be, fragmented, especially, immediately, afterwards, they, may, consolidate, with, time, and, sleep, a, man, or, boy, who, is, raped, may, be, stimulated, and, even, ejaculate, during, the, experience, of, the, rape, a, woman, or, girl, may, orgasm, during, a, sexual, assault, this, may, become, a, source, of, shame, and, confusion, for, those, assaulted, along, with, those, who, were, around, them, trauma, symptoms, may, not, show, until, years, after, the, sexual, assault, occurred, immediately, following, a, rape, the, survivor, may, react, outwardly, in, a, wide, range, of, ways, from, expressive, to, closed, down, common, emotions, include, distress, anxiety, shame, revulsion, helplessness, and, guilt, denial, is, not, uncommon, in, the, weeks, following, the, rape, the, survivor, may, develop, symptoms, of, post, traumatic, stress, syndrome, and, may, develop, a, wide, array, of, psychosomatic, complaints, 310, ptsd, symptoms, include, re, experiencing, of, the, rape, avoiding, things, associated, with, the, rape, numbness, and, increased, anxiety, and, startle, response, the, likelihood, of, sustained, severe, symptoms, is, higher, if, the, rapist, confined, or, restrained, the, person, if, the, person, being, raped, believed, the, rapist, would, kill, them, the, person, who, was, raped, was, very, young, or, very, old, and, if, the, rapist, was, someone, they, knew, the, likelihood, of, sustained, severe, symptoms, is, also, higher, if, people, around, the, survivor, ignore, or, are, ignorant, of, the, rape, or, blame, the, rape, survivor, most, people, recover, from, rape, in, three, to, four, months, but, many, have, persistent, ptsd, that, may, manifest, in, anxiety, depression, substance, abuse, irritability, anger, flashbacks, or, nightmares, in, addition, rape, survivors, may, have, long, term, generalised, anxiety, disorder, may, develop, one, or, more, specific, phobias, major, depressive, disorder, and, may, experience, difficulties, with, resuming, their, social, life, and, with, sexual, functioning, people, who, have, been, raped, are, at, higher, risk, of, suicide, men, experience, similar, psychological, effects, of, being, raped, but, they, are, less, likely, to, seek, counseling, another, effect, of, rape, and, sexual, assault, is, the, stress, created, in, those, who, study, rape, or, counsel, the, survivors, this, is, called, vicarious, traumatization, the, presence, or, absence, of, physical, injury, may, be, used, to, determine, whether, a, rape, has, occurred, those, who, have, experienced, sexual, assault, yet, have, no, physical, trauma, may, be, less, inclined, to, report, to, the, authorities, or, to, seek, health, care, while, penetrative, rape, generally, does, not, involve, the, use, of, a, condom, in, some, cases, a, condom, is, used, the, use, of, a, condom, significantly, reduces, the, likelihood, of, pregnancy, and, disease, transmission, both, to, the, victim, and, the, rapist, rationales, for, condom, use, include, avoiding, contracting, infections, or, diseases, particularly, hiv, especially, in, cases, of, rape, of, sex, workers, or, in, gang, rape, to, avoid, contracting, infections, or, diseases, from, fellow, rapists, eliminating, evidence, making, prosecution, more, difficult, and, giving, a, sense, of, invulnerability, giving, the, appearance, of, consent, in, cases, of, acquaintance, rape, and, thrill, from, planning, and, the, use, of, the, condom, as, an, added, prop, concern, for, the, victim, is, generally, not, considered, a, factor, those, who, have, been, raped, have, relatively, more, reproductive, tract, infections, than, those, who, have, not, been, raped, hiv, can, be, transmitted, through, rape, acquiring, aids, through, rape, puts, people, at, increased, risk, for, psychological, problems, acquiring, hiv, through, rape, may, lead, to, behaviors, that, create, a, risk, of, injecting, drugs, acquiring, sexually, transmitted, infections, increases, the, risk, of, acquiring, hiv, the, belief, that, having, sex, with, a, virgin, can, cure, hiv, aids, exists, in, parts, of, africa, this, leads, to, the, rape, of, girls, and, women, the, claim, that, the, myth, drives, either, hiv, infection, or, child, sexual, abuse, in, south, africa, is, disputed, by, researchers, rachel, jewkes, and, helen, epstein, society, s, treatment, of, victims, has, the, potential, to, exacerbate, their, trauma, people, who, have, been, raped, or, sexually, assaulted, are, sometimes, blamed, and, considered, responsible, for, the, crime, this, refers, to, the, just, world, fallacy, and, rape, myth, acceptance, that, certain, victim, behaviors, such, as, being, intoxicated, flirting, or, wearing, sexually, provocative, clothing, may, encourage, rape, in, many, cases, victims, are, said, to, have, asked, for, it, because, of, not, resisting, their, assault, or, violating, female, gender, expectations, a, global, survey, of, attitudes, toward, sexual, violence, by, the, global, forum, for, health, research, shows, that, victim, blaming, concepts, are, at, least, partially, accepted, in, many, countries, women, who, have, been, raped, are, sometimes, deemed, to, have, behaved, improperly, usually, these, are, cultures, where, there, is, a, significant, social, divide, between, the, freedoms, and, status, afforded, to, men, and, women, rape, victims, are, blamed, more, when, they, resist, the, attack, later, in, the, rape, encounter, rather, than, earlier, kopper, 1996, which, seems, to, suggest, the, stereotype, that, these, women, are, engaging, in, token, resistance, malamuth, brown, 1994, muehlenhard, rogers, 1998, or, leading, the, man, on, because, they, have, gone, along, with, the, sexual, experience, thus, far, finally, rape, victims, are, blamed, more, when, they, are, raped, by, an, acquaintance, or, a, date, rather, than, by, a, stranger, e, g, bell, kuriloff, lottes, 1994, bridges, 1991, bridges, mcgr, ail, 1989, check, malamuth, 1983, kanekar, shaherwalla, franco, kunju, pinto, 1991, l, armand, pepitone, 1982, tetreault, barnett, 1987, which, seems, to, evoke, the, stereotype, that, victims, really, want, to, have, sex, because, they, know, their, attacker, and, perhaps, even, went, out, on, a, date, with, him, the, underlying, message, of, this, research, seems, to, be, that, when, certain, stereotypical, elements, of, rape, are, in, place, rape, victims, are, prone, to, being, blamed, commentators, state, individuals, may, endorse, rape, myths, and, at, the, same, time, recognize, the, negative, effects, of, rape, a, number, of, gender, role, stereotypes, can, play, a, role, in, rationalization, of, rape, these, include, the, idea, that, power, is, reserved, to, men, whereas, women, are, meant, for, sex, and, objectified, that, women, want, forced, sex, and, to, be, pushed, around, and, that, male, sexual, impulses, and, behaviors, are, uncontrollable, and, must, be, satisfied, for, females, victim, blaming, correlates, with, fear, many, rape, victims, blame, themselves, female, jurors, might, look, at, the, woman, on, the, witness, stand, and, believe, she, had, done, something, to, entice, the, defendant, in, chinese, culture, victim, blaming, is, often, associated, with, the, crime, of, rape, as, women, are, expected, to, resist, rape, using, physical, force, thus, if, rape, occurs, it, is, considered, to, be, at, least, partly, the, woman, s, fault, and, her, virtue, is, called, into, question, in, many, cultures, those, who, are, raped, have, a, high, risk, of, suffering, additional, violence, or, threats, of, violence, after, the, rape, this, can, be, perpetrated, by, the, rapist, friends, or, relatives, of, the, rapist, the, intent, can, be, to, prevent, the, victim, from, reporting, the, rape, other, reasons, for, threats, against, those, assaulted, is, to, punish, them, for, reporting, it, or, of, forcing, them, to, withdraw, the, complaint, the, relatives, of, the, person, who, has, been, raped, may, wish, to, prevent, bringing, shame, to, the, family, and, may, also, threaten, them, this, is, especially, the, case, in, cultures, where, female, virginity, is, highly, valued, and, considered, mandatory, before, marriage, in, extreme, cases, rape, victims, are, killed, in, honor, killings, in, the, us, victims, rights, include, the, right, to, have, a, victims, advocate, preside, over, every, step, of, the, medical, legal, exam, to, ensure, sensitivity, towards, victims, provide, emotional, support, and, minimize, the, risk, of, re, traumatization, victims, are, to, be, informed, of, this, immediately, by, law, enforcement, or, medical, service, providers, emergency, rooms, of, many, hospitals, employ, sexual, assault, nurse, forensic, examiners, san, fes, with, specific, training, to, care, for, those, who, have, experienced, a, rape, or, sexual, assault, they, are, able, to, conduct, a, focused, medical, legal, exam, if, such, a, trained, clinician, is, not, available, the, emergency, department, has, a, sexual, assault, protocol, that, has, been, established, for, treatment, and, the, collection, of, evidence, staff, are, also, trained, to, explain, the, examinations, in, detail, the, documentation, and, the, rights, associated, with, the, requirement, for, informed, consent, emphasis, is, placed, on, performing, the, examinations, at, a, pace, that, is, appropriate, for, the, person, their, family, their, age, and, their, level, of, understanding, privacy, is, recommended, to, prevent, self, harm, many, rapes, do, not, result, in, serious, physical, injury, the, first, medical, response, to, sexual,

staff, are, made, available, to, the, patient, and, family, if, the, patient, or, the, caregivers, typically, parents, agree, the, medical, team, utilizes, standardized, sampling, and, testing, usually, referred, to, as, a, forensic, evidence, kit, or, rape, kit, the, patient, is, informed, that, submitting, to, the, use, of, the, rape, kit, does, not, obligate, them, to, file, criminal, charges, against, the, perpetrator, the, patient, is, discouraged, from, bathing, or, showering, to, obtain, samples, from, their, hair, evidence, gathered, within, the, past, 72, hours, is, more, likely, to, be, valid, the, sooner, that, samples, are, obtained, after, the, assault, the, more, likely, that, evidence, is, present, in, the, sample, and, provides, valid, results, once, the, injuries, of, the, patient, have, been, treated, and, she, or, he, is, stabilized, the, sample, gathering, will, begin, staff, will, encourage, the, presence, of, a, rape, sexual, assault, counselor,

medications, which, can, significantly, reduce, risk, of, an, undesired, pregnancy, if, used, within, 5, days, of, rape, it, is, estimated, that, about, 5, of, male, on, female, rapes, result, in, pregnancy, when, rape, results, in, pregnancy, abortion, pills, can, be, safely, and, effectively, used, to, end, a, pregnancy, up, to, 10, weeks, from, the, last, menstrual, period, an, internal, pelvic, exam, is, not, recommended, for, sexually, immature, or, prepubescent, girls, due, to, the, probability, that, internal, injuries, do, not, exist, in, this, age, group, however, an, internal, exam, may, be, recommended, if, significant, bloody, discharge, is, observed, a, complete, pelvic, exam, for, rape, anal, or, vaginal, is, conducted, an, oral, exam, is, done, if, there, have, been, injuries, to, the, mouth, teeth, gums, or, pharynx, though, the, patient, may, have, no, complaints, about, genital, pain, signs, of, trauma, can, still, be, assessed, before, the, complete, bodily, and, genital, exam, the, patient, is, asked, to, undress, standing, on, a, white, sheet, that, collects, any, debris, that, may, be, in, the, clothing, the, clothing, and, sheet, are, properly, bagged, and, labeled, along, with, other, samples, that, can, be, removed, from, the, body, or, clothing, of, the, patient, samples, of, fibers, mud, hair, or, leaves, are, gathered, if, present,

genital, injuries, are, anal, injury, labial, abrasions, hymenal, bruising, and, tears, of, the, posterior, fourchette, and, fossa, bruises, tears, abrasions, inflammation, and, lacerations, may, be, visible, if, a, foreign, object, was, used, during, the, assault, x, ray, visualization, will, identify, retained, fragments, genital, injuries, are, more, prevalent, in, post, menopausal, women, and, prepubescent, girls, internal, injuries, to, the, cervix, and, vagina, can, be, visualized, using, colposcopy, using, colposcopy, has, increased, the, detection, of, internal, trauma, from, six, percent, to, fifty, three, percent, genital, injuries, to, children, who, have, been, raped, or, sexually, assaulted, differ, in, that, the, abuse, may, be, on, going, or, may, have, happened, in, the, past, after, the, injuries, heal, scarring, is, one, sign, of, the, sexual, abuse, of, children, several, studies, have, explored, the, association, between, skin, color, and, genital, injury, among, rape, victims, many, studies, found, a, difference, in, rape, related, injury, based, on, race, with, more, injuries, being, reported, for, white, females, and, males, than, for, black, females, and, males, this, may, be, because, the, dark, skin, color, of, some, victims, obscures, bruising, examiners, paying, attention, to, victims, with, darker, skin, especially, the, thighs, labia, majora, posterior, fourchette, and, fossa, navicularis, can, help, remedy, this, the, presence, of, a, sexually, contracted, infection, can, not, be, confirmed, after, rape, because, it, cannot, be, detected, until, 72, hours, afterwards, the, person, who, was, raped, may, already, have, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, and, if, diagnosed, it, is, treated, prophylactic, antibiotic, treatment, for, vaginitis, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and, chlamydia, may, be, performed, chlamydial, and, gonococcal, infections, in, women, are, of, particular, concern, due, to, the, possibility, of, ascending, infection, immunization, against, hepatitis, b, is, often, considered, after, prophylactic, treatment, is, initiated, further, testing, is, done, to, determine, what, other, treatments, may, be, necessary, for, other, infections, transmitted, during, the, assault, these, are, treatment, may, include, the, administration, of, zidovudine, lamivudine, tenofovir, emtricitabine, or, ritonavir, lopinavir, information, regarding, other, treatment, options, is, available, from, the, cdc, the, transmission, of, hiv, is, frequently, a, major, concern, of, the, patient, prophylactic, treatment, for, hiv, is, not, necessarily, administered, routine, treatment, for, hiv, after, rape, or, sexual, assault, is, controversial, due, to, the, low, risk, of, infection, after, one, sexual, assault, transmission, of, hiv, after, one, exposure, to, penetrative, anal, sex, is, estimated, to, be, 0, 5, to, 3, 2, percent, transmission, of, hiv, after, one, exposure, to, penetrative, vaginal, intercourse, is, 0, 05, to, 0, 15, percent, hiv, can, also, be, contracted, through, the, oral, route, but, this, is, considered, rare, other, recommendations, are, that, the, patient, be, treated, prophylactically, for, hiv, if, the, perpetrator, is, found, to, be, infected, testing, at, the, time, of, the, initial, exam, does, not, typically, have, forensic, value, if, patients, are, sexually, active, and, have, an, sti, since, it, could, have, been, acquired, before, the, assault, rape, shield, laws, protect, the, person, who, was, raped, and, who, has, positive, test, results, these, laws, prevent, having, such, evidence, used, against, someone, who, was, raped, someone, who, was, raped, may, be, concerned, that, a, prior, infection, may, suggest, sexual, promiscuity, there, may, however, be, situations, in, which, testing, has, a, legal, purpose, as, in, cases, where, the, threat, of, transmission, or, actual, transmission, of, an, sti, was, part, of, the, crime, in, nonsexually, active, patients, an, initial, baseline, negative, test, that, is, followed, by, a, subsequent, sti, could, be, used, as, evidence, if, the, perpetrator, also, had, an, sti, treatment, failure, is, possible, due, to, the, emergence, of, antibiotic, resistant, strains, of, pathogens, psychiatric, and, emotional, consequences, can, be, apparent, immediately, after, the, rape, and, it, may, be, necessary, to, treat, these, very, early, in, the, evaluation, and, treatment, other, treatable, emotional, and, psychiatric, disorders, may, not, become, evident, until, some, time, after, the, rape, these, can, be, eating, disorders, anxiety, fear, intrusive, thoughts, fear, of, crowds, avoidance, anger, depression, humiliation, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, hyperarousal, sexual, disorders, including, fear, of, engaging, in, sexual, activity, mood, disorders, suicidal, ideation, borderline, personality, disorder, nightmares, fear, of, situations, that, remind, the, patient, of, the, rape, and, fear, of, being, alone, agitation, numbness, and, emotional, distance, victims, are, able, to, receive, help, by, using, a, telephone, hotline, counseling, or, shelters, recovery, from, sexual, assault, is, a, complicated, and, controversial, concept, but, support, groups, usually, accessed, by, organizations, are, available, to, help, in, recovery, professional, counseling, and, ongoing, treatment, by, trained, health, care, providers, are, often, sought, by, the, victim, some, clinicians, are, specially, trained, in, the, treatment, of, those, who, have, experienced, rape, and, sexual, assault, abuse, treatment, can, be, lengthy, and, challenging, for, both, the, counselor, and, the, patient, several, treatment, options, exist, and, vary, by, accessibility, cost, or, whether, or, not, insurance, coverage, exists, for, the, treatment, treatment, also, varies, depending, upon, the, expertise, of, the, counselor, some, have, more, experience, and, or, have, specialized, in, the, treatment, of, sexual, trauma, and, rape, to, be, the, most, effective, a, treatment, plan, should, be, developed, based, upon, the, struggles, of, the, patient, and, not, necessarily, based, upon, the, traumatic, experience, an, effective, treatment, plan, will, consider, the, following, current, stressors, coping, skills, physical, health, interpersonal, conflicts, self, esteem, family, issues, involvement, of, the, guardian, and, the, presence, of, mental, health, symptoms, the, degree, of, success, for, emotional, and, psychiatric, treatments, is, often, dependent, upon, the, terminology, used, in, the, treatment, i, e, redefining, the, event, and, experience, labels, used, like, rape, victim, and, rape, survivor, to, describe, the, new, identities, of, women, who, have, been, raped, suggest, that, the, event, is, the, dominant, and, controlling, influence, on, her, life, these, may, affect, supportive, personnel, the, consequences, of, using, these, labels, need, to, be, assessed, positive, outcomes, of, emotional, and, psychiatric, treatment, for, rape, exist, these, can, be, an, improved, self, concept, the, recognition, of, growth, and, implementing, new, coping, styles, a, perpetrator, found, guilty, by, the, court, is, often, required, to, receive, treatment, there, are, many, options, for, treatment, some, more, successful, than, others, the, psychological, factors, that, motivated, the, convicted, perpetrator, are, complex, but, treatment, can, still, be, effective, a, counselor, will, typically, evaluate, disorders, that, are, currently, present, in, the, offender, investigating, the, developmental, background, of, the, offender, can, help, explain, the, origins, of, the, abusive, behavior, that, occurred, in, the, first, place, emotional, and, psychological, treatment, has, the, purpose, of, identifying, predictors, of, recidivism, or, the, potential, that, the, offender, will, commit, rape, again, in, some, instances, neurological, abnormalities, have, been, identified, in, the, perpetrators, and, in, some, cases, they, have, themselves, experienced, past, trauma, adolescents, and, other, children, can, be, the, perpetrators, of, rape, although, this, is, uncommon, in, this, instance, appropriate, counseling, and, evaluation, are, usually, conducted, short, term, treatment, with, a, benzodiazepine, may, help, with, anxiety, although, caution, is, recommended, with, the, use, of, these, medications, as, people, can, become, addicted, and, develop, withdrawal, symptoms, after, regular, use, and, antidepressants, may, be, helpful, for, symptoms, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, depression, and, panic, attacks, as, sexual, violence, affects, all, parts, of, society, the, response, to, sexual, violence, is, comprehensive, the, responses, can, be, categorized, as, individual, approaches, healthcare,

underestimated, southern, africa, oceania, and, north, america, report, the, highest, numbers, of, rape, most, rape, is, committed, by, someone, the, victim, knows, by, contrast, rape, committed, by, strangers, is, relatively, uncommon, statistics, reported, by, the, rape, abuse, incest, national, network, rainn, indicate, that, 7, out, of, 10, cases, of, sexual, assault, involved, a, perpetrator,

reported, in, 2000, with, welfare, groups, believing, that, unreported, incidents, could, be, up, to, 10, times, higher, current, data, suggest, that, the, incidence, of, rape, has, risen, significantly, in, india, most, rape, research, and, reports, of, rape, are, limited, to, male, female, forms, of, rape, research, on, male, on, male, and, female, on, male, rape, is, rare, fewer, than, one, in, ten, male, male, rapes, are, reported, as, a, group, males, who, have, been, raped, by, either, gender, often, get, little, services, and, support, and, legal, systems, are, often, ill, equipped, to, deal, with, this, type, of, crime, instances, in, which, the, perpetrator, is, female, may, not, be, clear, and, can, lead, to, dismissing, women, as, sexual, aggressors, which, can, obscure, the, dimensions, of, the, problem, research, also, suggests, that, men, with, sexually, aggressive, peers, have, a, higher, chance, of, reporting, coercive, or, forced, sexual, intercourse, outside, gang, circles, than, men, without, such, sexually, aggressive, peers, risk, factors, vary, among, different, ethnicities, in, the, united, states, about, one, third, of, african, american,

italy, a, 2006, national, statistic, institute, survey, on, sexual, violence, against, women, found, that, 91, 6, of, women, who, suffered, this, did, not, report, it, to, the, police, in, japan, in, 2018, human, rights, watch, reported, that, over, 95, of, incidents, of, sexual, violence, in, japan, are, not, reported, to, police, in, 2023, japan, adopted, a, new, sex, crime, law, that, brought, about, several, changes, it, replaced, forcible, sexual, intercourse, with, non, consensual, sexual, intercourse, and, further, outlines, eight, scenarios, considered, rape, emphasizing, one, s,

5, at, that, time, the, government, report, has, expressed, documented, the, year, on, year, increase, in, attrition, of, reported, rape, cases, and, pledged, to, address, this, justice, gap, according, to, amnesty, international, ireland, had, the, lowest, rate, of, conviction, for, rape, 1, among, 21, european, states, in, 2003, in, america, as, of, 2012, there, exists, a, noticeable, discrepancy, in, conviction, rates, among, women, of, various, ethnic, identities, an, arrest, was, made, in, just, 13, of, the, sexual, assaults, reported, by, american, indian, women, compared, with, 35, for, black, women, and, 32, for, whites, in, 2024, the, university, of, cambridge, did, a, study, on, rape, in, japan, they, found, that, while, japanese, police, claim, to, solve, 97, percent, of, rape, cases, only, 5, 10, percent, of, rape, victims, report, it, to, police, and, police, record, less, than, half, of, reported, cases, while, prosecutors, charge, about, one, third, of, recorded, cases, also, for, every, 1000, rapes, in, japan, only, 10, 20, 1, 2, result, in, the, offender, being, charged, and, convicted, judicial, bias, due, to, rape, myths, and, preconceived, notions, about, rape, is, a, salient, issue, in, rape, conviction, but, voir, dire, intervention, may, be, used, to, curb, such, bias, a, false, accusation, of, rape, is, the, reporting, of, a, rape, where, no, rape, has, occurred, it, is, difficult, to, assess, the, true, prevalence, of, false, rape, allegations, but, it, is, generally, agreed, by, scholars, that, rape, accusations, are, false, about, 2, to, 10, of, the, time, in, most, cases, a, false, accusation, will, not, name, a, specific, suspect, eight, percent, of, 2, 643, sexual, assault, cases, were, classified, as, false, reports, by, the, police, in, one, study, the, researchers, noted, that, many, of, these, classifications, were, based, on, the, personal, judgments, and, biases, of, the, police, investigators, and, were, made, in, violation, of, official, criteria, for, establishing, a, false, allegation, closer, analysis, of, this, category, applying, the, home, office, counting, rules, for, establishing, a, false, allegation, which, requires, strong, evidential, grounds, of, a, false, allegation, or, a, clear, and, credible, retraction, by, the, complainant, reduced, the, percentage, of, false, reports, to, 3, the, researchers, concluded, that, one, cannot, take, all, police, designations, at, face, value, and, that, here, is, an, over, estimation, of, the, scale, of, false, allegations, by, both, police, officers, and, prosecutors, another, large, scale, study, was, conducted, in, australia, with, 850, rapes, reported, to, the, victoria, police, between, 2000, and, 2003, heenan, murray, 2006, using, both, quantitative, and, qualitative, methods, the, researchers, examined, 812, cases, and, found, 15, 1, of, complaints, were, withdrawn, 46, 4, were, marked, no, further, police, action, and, 2, 1, of, the, total, were, clearly, classified, by, police, as, false, reports, in, these, cases, the, alleged, victim, was, either, charged, with, filing, a, false, police, report, or, threatened, with, charges, and, the, complaint, subsequently, withdrawn, in, the, united, kingdom, the, crown, prosecution, service, cps, analyzed, every, rape, complaint, made, over, a, 17, month, period, and, found, that, the, indication, is, that, it, is, therefore, extremely, rare, that, a, suspect, deliberately, makes, a, false, allegation, of, rape, or, domestic, violence, purely, out, of, malice, fbi, reports, consistently, put, the, number, of, unfounded, rape, accusations, around, 8, the, unfounded, rate, is, higher, for, forcible, rape, than, for, any, other, index, crime, the, average, rate, of, unfounded, reports, for, index, crimes, is, 2, unfounded, is, not, synonymous, with, a, false, allegation, bruce, gross, of, the, forensic, examiner, described, it, as, meaningless, saying, a, report, could, be, marked, as, unfounded, if, there, is, no, physical, evidence, or, the, alleged, victim, did, not, sustain, any, physical, injuries, other, studies, have, suggested, that, the, rate, of, false, allegations, in, the, united, states, may, be, higher, a, nine, year, study, by, eugene, j, kanin, of, purdue, university, in, a, small, metropolitan, area, in, the, midwestern, united, states, claimed, that, 41, of, rape, accusations, were, false, however, david, lisak, an, associate, professor, of, psychology, and, director, of, the, men, s, sexual, trauma, research, project, at, the, university, of, massachusetts, boston, states, that, kanin, s, 1994, article, on, false, allegations, is, a, provocative, opinion, piece, but, it, is, not, a, scientific, study, of, the, issue, of, false, reporting, of, rape, he, further, states, that, kanin, s, study, has, a, significantly, poor, systematic, methodology, and, had, no, independent, definition, of, a, false, report, instead, kanin, classified, reports, that, the, police, department, classified, as, false, also, as, false, the, criterion, for, falsehood, was, simply, a, denial, of, a, polygraph, test, of, the, accuser, a, 1998, report, by, the, national, institute, of, justice, found, that, dna, evidence, excluded, the, primary, suspect, in, 26, of, rape, cases, and, concluded, that, this, strongly, suggests, that, postarrest, and, postconviction, dna, exonerations, are, tied, to, some, strong, underlying, systemic, problems, that, generate, erroneous, accusations, and, convictions, however, this, study, also, noted, that, analyzed, samples, involved, a, specific, subset, of, rape, cases, e, g, those, where, there, is, no, consent, defense, a, 2010, study, by, david, lisak, lori, gardinier, and, other, researchers, published, in, the, journal, of, violence, against, women, found, that, out, of, 136, cases, reported, in, a, ten, year, period, 5, 9, were, found, likely, to, be, false, a, 2018, study, in, the, uk, by, lesley, mcmillan, published, in, the, journal, of, gender, studies, found, that, although, police, estimated, 5, 95, of, rape, claims, were, likely, to, be, false, the, analysis, showed, no, more, than, 3, 4, were, possible, to, be, evidenced, as, fabricated, virtually, all, societies, have, had, a, concept, of, the, crime, of, rape, although, what, constituted, this, crime,
