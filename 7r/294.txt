in, linguistics, and, grammar, a, sentence, is, a, linguistic, expression, such, as, the, english, example, the, quick, brown, fox, jumps, over, the, lazy, dog, in, traditional, grammar, it, is, typically, defined, as, a, string, of, words, that, expresses, a, complete, thought, or, as, a, unit, consisting, of, a, subject, and, predicate, in, non, functional, linguistics, it, is, typically, defined, as, a, maximal, unit, of, syntactic, structure, such, as, a, constituent, in, functional, linguistics, it, is, defined, as, a, unit, of, written, texts, delimited, by, graphological, features, such, as, upper, case, letters, and, markers, such, as, periods, question, marks, and, exclamation, marks, this, notion, contrasts, with, a, curve, which, is, delimited, by, phonologic, features, such, as, pitch, and, loudness, and, markers, such, as, pauses, and, with, a, clause, which, is, a, sequence, of, words, that, represents, some, process, going, on, throughout, time, a, sentence, can, include, words, grouped, meaningfully, to, express, a, statement, question, exclamation, request, command, or, suggestion, a, sentence, is, typically, associated, with, a, clause, a, clause, can, either, be, a, clause, simplex, or, a, clause, complex, a, clause, simplex, represents, a, single, process, going, on, through, time, a, clause, complex, represents, a, logical, relation, between, two, or, more, processes, and, is, thus, composed, of, two, or, more, clause, simplexes, a, clause, simplex, typically, contains, a, predication, structure, with, a, subject, noun, phrase, and, a, finite, verb, although, the, subject, is, usually, a, noun, phrase, other, kinds, of, phrases, such, as, gerund, phrases, work, as, well, and, some, languages, allow, subjects, to, be, omitted, in, the, examples, below, the, subject, of, the, outmost, clause, simplex, is, in, italics, and, the, subject, of, boiling, is, in, square, brackets, there, is, clause, embedding, in, the, second, and, third, examples, there, are, two, types, of, clauses, independent, and, non, independent, interdependent, an, independent, clause, realises, a, speech, act, such, as, a, statement, a, question, a, command, or, an, offer, a, non, independent, clause, does, not, realise, any, act, a, non, independent, clause, simplex, or, complex, is, usually, logically, related, to, other, non, independent, clauses, together, they, usually, constitute, a, single, independent, clause, complex, for, that, reason, non, independent, clauses, are, also, called, interdependent, for, instance, the, non, independent, clause, because, i, have, no, friends, is, related, to, the, non, independent, clause, i, don, t, go, out, in, i, don, t, go, out, because, i, have, no, friends, the, whole, clause, complex, is, independent, because, it, realises, a, statement, what, is, stated, is, the, causal, nexus, between, having, no, friend, and, not, going, out, when, such, a, statement, is, acted, out, the, fact, that, the, speaker, doesn, t, go, out, is, already, established, therefore, it, cannot, be, stated, what, is, still, open, and, under, negotiation, is, the, reason, for, that, fact, the, causal, nexus, is, represented, by, the, independent, clause, complex, and, not, by, the, two, interdependent, clause, simplexes, see, also, copula, for, the, consequences, of, the, verb, to, be, on, the, theory, of, sentence, structure, one, traditional, scheme, for, classifying, english, sentences, is, by, clause, structure, the, number, and, types, of, clauses, in, the, sentence, with, finite, verbs, sentences, can, also, be, classified, based, on, the, speech, act, which, they, perform, for, instance, english, sentence, types, can, be, described, as, follows, the, form, declarative, interrogative, imperative, or, exclamative, and, meaning, statement, question, command, or, exclamation, of, a, sentence, usually, match, but, not, always, for, instance, the, interrogative, sentence, can, you, pass, me, the, salt, is, not, intended, to, express, a, question, but, rather, to, express, a, command, likewise, the, interrogative, sentence, can, t, you, do, anything, right, is, not, intended, to, express, a, question, on, the, listener, s, ability, but, rather, to, make, an, exclamation, about, the, listener, s, lack, of, ability, also, called, a, rhetorical, question, a, major, sentence, is, a, regular, sentence, it, has, a, subject, and, a, predicate, e, g, i, have, a, ball, in, this, sentence, one, can, change, the, persons, e, g, we, have, a, ball, however, a, minor, sentence, is, an, irregular, type, of, sentence, that, does, not, contain, a, main, clause, e, g, mary, precisely, so, next, tuesday, evening, after, it, gets, dark, other, examples, of, minor, sentences, are, headings, stereotyped, expressions, hello, emotional, expressions, wow, proverbs, etc, these, can, also, include, nominal, sentences, like, the, more, the, merrier, these, mostly, omit, a, main, verb, for, the, sake, of, conciseness, but, may, also, do, so, in, order, to, intensify, the, meaning, around, the, nouns, sentences, that, comprise, a, single, word, are, called, word, sentences, and, the, words, themselves, sentence, words, the, 1980s, saw, a, renewed, surge, in, interest, in, sentence, length, primarily, in, relation, to, other, syntactic, phenomena, one, definition, of, the, average, sentence, length, of, a, prose, passage, is, the, ratio, of, the, number, of, words, to, the, number, of, sentences, the, textbook, mathematical, linguistics, by, andr, s, kornai, suggests, that, in, journalistic, prose, the, median, sentence, length, is, above, 15, words, the, average, length, of, a, sentence, generally, serves, as, a, measure, of, sentence, difficulty, or, complexity, in, general, as, the, average, sentence, length, increases, the, complexity, of, the, sentences, also, increases, another, definition, of, sentence, length, is, the, number, of, clauses, in, the, sentence, whereas, the, clause, length, is, the, number, of, phones, in, the, clause, research, by, erik, schils, and, pieter, de, haan, by, sampling, five, texts, showed, that, two, adjacent, sentences, are, more, likely, to, have, similar, lengths, than, two, non, adjacent, sentences, and, almost, certainly, have, a, similar, length, when, in, a, work, of, fiction, this, countered, the, theory, that, authors, may, aim, at, an, alternation, of, long, and, short, sentences, sentence, length, as, well, as, word, difficulty, are, both, factors, in, the, readability, of, a, sentence, however, other, factors, such, as, the, presence, of, conjunctions, have, been, said, to, facilitate, comprehension, considerably
