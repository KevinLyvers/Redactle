expressed, capacity, mentally, physically, and, socially, of, human, individuals, or, groups, to, respond, to, internal, and, external, stimuli, throughout, their, life, behavior, is, driven, by, genetic, and, environmental, factors, that, affect, an, individual, behavior, is, also, driven, in, part, by, thoughts, and, feelings, which, provide, insight, into, individual, psyche, revealing, such, things, as, attitudes, and, values, human, behavior, is, shaped, by, psychological, traits, as, personality, types, vary, from, person, to, person, producing, different, actions, and, behavior, social, behavior, accounts, for, actions, directed, at, others, it, is, concerned, with, the, considerable, influence, of, social, interaction, and, culture, as, well, as, ethics, interpersonal, relationships, politics, and, conflict, some, behaviors, are, common, while, others, are, unusual, the, acceptability, of, behavior, depends, upon, social, norms, and, is, regulated, by, various, means, of, social, control, social, norms, also, condition, behavior, whereby, humans, are, pressured, into, following, certain, rules, and, displaying, certain, behaviors, that, are, deemed, acceptable, or, unacceptable, depending, on, the, given, society, or, culture, cognitive, behavior, accounts, for, actions, of, obtaining, and, using, knowledge, it, is, concerned, with, how, information, is, learned, and, passed, on, as, well, as, creative, application, of, knowledge, and, personal, beliefs, such, as, religion, physiological, behavior, accounts, for, actions, to, maintain, the, body, it, is, concerned, with, basic, bodily, functions, as, well, as, measures, taken, to, maintain, health, economic, behavior, accounts, for, actions, regarding, the, development, organization, and, use, of, materials, as, well, as, other, forms, of, work, ecological, behavior, accounts, for, actions, involving, the, ecosystem, it, is, concerned, with, how, humans, interact, with, other, organisms, and, how, the, environment, shapes, human, behavior, human, behavior, is, studied, by, the, social, sciences, which, include, psychology, sociology, ethology, and, their, various, branches, and, schools, of, thought, there, are, many, different, facets, of, human, behavior, and, no, one, definition, or, field, study, encompasses, it, in, its, entirety, the, nature, versus, nurture, debate, is, one, of, the, fundamental, divisions, in, the, study, of, human, behavior, this, debate, considers, whether, behavior, is, predominantly, affected, by, genetic, or, environmental, factors, the, study, of, human, behavior, sometimes, receives, public, attention, due, to, its, intersection, with, cultural, issues, including, crime, sexuality, and, social, inequality, some, natural, sciences, also, place, emphasis, on, human, behavior, neurology, and, evolutionary, biology, study, how, behavior, is, controlled, by, the, nervous, system, and, how, the, human, mind, evolved, respectively, in, other, fields, human, behavior, may, be, a, secondary, subject, of, study, when, considering, how, it, affects, another, subject, outside, of, formal, scientific, inquiry, human, behavior, and, the, human, condition, is, also, a, major, focus, of, philosophy, and, literature, philosophy, of, mind, considers, aspects, such, as, free, will, the, mind, body, problem, and, malleability, of, human, behavior, human, behavior, may, be, evaluated, through, questionnaires, interviews, and, experimental, methods, animal, testing, may, also, be, used, to, test, behaviors, that, can, then, be, compared, to, human, behavior, twin, studies, are, a, common, method, by, which, human, behavior, is, studied, twins, with, identical, genomes, can, be, compared, to, isolate, genetic, and, environmental, factors, in, behavior, lifestyle, susceptibility, to, disease, and, unhealthy, behaviors, have, been, identified, to, have, both, genetic, and, environmental, indicators, through, twin, studies, human, social, behavior, is, the, behavior, that, considers, other, humans, including, communication, and, cooperation, it, is, highly, complex, and, structured, based, on, advanced, theory, of, mind, that, allows, humans, to, attribute, thoughts, and, actions, to, one, another, through, social, behavior, humans, have, developed, society, and, culture, distinct, from, other, animals, human, social, behavior, is, governed, by, a, combination, of, biological, factors, that, affect, all, humans, and, cultural, factors, that, change, depending, on, upbringing, and, societal, norms, human, communication, is, based, heavily, on, language, typically, through, speech, or, writing, nonverbal, communication, and, paralanguage, can, modify, the, meaning, of, communications, by, demonstrating, ideas, and, intent, through, physical, and, vocal, behaviors, human, behavior, in, a, society, is, governed, by, social, norms, social, norms, are, unwritten, expectations, that, members, of, society, have, for, one, another, these, norms, are, ingrained, in, the, particular, culture, that, they, emerge, from, and, humans, often, follow, them, unconsciously, or, without, deliberation, these, norms, affect, every, aspect, of, life, in, human, society, including, decorum, social, responsibility, property, rights, contractual, agreement, morality, justice, and, meaning, many, norms, facilitate, coordination, between, members, of, society, and, prove, mutually, beneficial, such, as, norms, regarding, communication, and, agreements, norms, are, enforced, by, social, pressure, and, individuals, that, violate, social, norms, risk, social, exclusion, systems, of, ethics, are, used, to, guide, human, behavior, to, determine, what, is, moral, humans, are, distinct, from, other, animals, in, the, use, of, ethical, systems, to, determine, behavior, ethical, behavior, is, human, behavior, that, takes, into, consideration, how, actions, will, affect, others, and, whether, behaviors, will, be, optimal, for, others, what, constitutes, ethical, behavior, is, determined, by, the, individual, value, judgments, of, the, person, and, the, collective, social, norms, regarding, right, and, wrong, value, judgments, are, intrinsic, to, people, of, all, cultures, though, the, specific, systems, used, to, evaluate, them, may, vary, these, systems, may, be, derived, from, divine, law, natural, law, civil, authority, reason, or, a, combination, of, these, and, other, principles, altruism, is, an, associated, behavior, in, which, humans, consider, the, welfare, of, others, equally, or, preferentially, to, their, own, while, other, animals, engage, in, biological, altruism, ethical, altruism, is, unique, to, humans, deviance, is, behavior, that, violates, social, norms, as, social, norms, vary, between, individuals, and, cultures, the, nature, and, severity, of, a, deviant, act, is, subjective, what, is, considered, deviant, by, a, society, may, also, change, over, time, as, new, social, norms, are, developed, deviance, is, punished, by, other, individuals, through, social, stigma, censure, or, violence, many, deviant, actions, are, recognized, as, crimes, and, punished, through, a, system, of, criminal, justice, deviant, actions, may, be, punished, to, prevent, harm, to, others, to, maintain, a, particular, worldview, and, way, of, life, or, to, enforce, principles, of, morality, and, decency, cultures, also, attribute, positive, or, negative, value, to, certain, physical, traits, causing, individuals, that, do, not, have, desirable, traits, to, be, seen, as, deviant, interpersonal, relationships, can, be, evaluated, by, the, specific, choices, and, emotions, between, two, individuals, or, they, can, be, evaluated, by, the, broader, societal, context, of, how, such, a, relationship, is, expected, to, function, relationships, are, developed, through, communication, which, creates, intimacy, expresses, emotions, and, develops, identity, an, individual, s, interpersonal, relationships, form, a, social, group, in, which, individuals, all, communicate, and, socialize, with, one, another, and, these, social, groups, are, connected, by, additional, relationships, human, social, behavior, is, affected, not, only, by, individual, relationships, but, also, by, how, behaviors, in, one, relationship, may, affect, others, individuals, that, actively, seek, out, social, interactions, are, extraverts, and, those, that, do, not, are, introverts, romantic, love, is, a, significant, interpersonal, attraction, toward, another, its, nature, varies, by, culture, but, it, is, often, contingent, on, gender, occurring, in, conjunction, with, sexual, attraction, and, being, either, heterosexual, or, homosexual, it, takes, different, forms, and, is, associated, with, many, individual, emotions, many, cultures, place, a, higher, emphasis, on, romantic, love, than, other, forms, of, interpersonal, attraction, marriage, is, a, union, between, two, people, though, whether, it, is, associated, with, romantic, love, is, dependent, on, the, culture, individuals, that, are, closely, related, by, consanguinity, form, a, family, there, are, many, variations, on, family, structures, that, may, include, parents, and, children, as, well, as, stepchildren, or, extended, relatives, family, units, with, children, emphasize, parenting, in, which, parents, engage, in, a, high, level, of, parental, investment, to, protect, and, instruct, children, as, they, develop, over, a, period, of, time, longer, than, that, of, most, other, mammals, when, humans, make, decisions, as, a, group, they, engage, in, politics, humans, have, evolved, to, engage, in, behaviors, of, self, interest, but, this, also, includes, behaviors, that, facilitate, cooperation, rather, than, conflict, in, collective, settings, individuals, will, often, form, in, group, and, out, group, perceptions, through, which, individuals, cooperate, with, the, in, group, and, compete, with, the, out, group, this, causes, behaviors, such, as, unconsciously, conforming, passively, obeying, authority, taking, pleasure, in, the, misfortune, of, opponents, initiating, hostility, toward, out, group, members, artificially, creating, out, groups, when, none, exist, and, punishing, those, that, do, not, comply, with, the, standards, of, the, in, group, these, behaviors, lead, to, the, creation, of, political, systems, that, enforce, in, group, standards, and, norms, when, humans, oppose, one, another, it, creates, conflict, it, may, occur, when, the, involved, parties, have, a, disagreement, of, opinion, when, one, party, obstructs, the, goals, of, another, or, when, parties, experience, negative, emotions, such, as, anger, toward, one, another, conflicts, purely, of, disagreement, are, often, resolved, through, communication, or, negotiation, but, incorporation, of, emotional, or, obstructive, aspects, can, escalate, conflict, interpersonal, conflict, is, that, between, specific, individuals, or, groups, of, individuals, social, conflict, is, that, between, different, social, groups, or, demographics, this, form, of, conflict, often, takes, place, when, groups, in, society, are, marginalized, do, not, have, the, resources, they, desire, wish, to, instigate, social, change, or, wish, to, resist, social, change, significant, social, conflict, can, cause, civil, disorder, international, conflict, is, that, between, nations, or, governments, it, may, be, solved, through, diplomacy, or, war, human, cognition, is, distinct, from, that, of, other, animals, this, is, derived, from, biological, traits, of, human, cognition, but, also, from, shared, knowledge, and, development, passed, down, culturally, humans, are, able, to, learn, from, one, another, due, to, advanced, theory, of, mind, that, allows, knowledge, to, be, obtained, through, education, the, use, of, language, allows, humans, to, directly, pass, knowledge, to, one, another, the, human, brain, has, neuroplasticity, allowing, it, to, modify, its, features, in, response, to, new, experiences, this, facilitates, learning, in, humans, and, leads, to, behaviors, of, practice, allowing, the, development, of, new, skills, in, individual, humans, behavior, carried, out, over, time, can, be, ingrained, as, a, habit, where, humans, will, continue, to, regularly, engage, in, the, behavior, without, consciously, deciding, to, do, so, humans, engage, in, reason, to, make, inferences, with, a, limited, amount, of, information, most, human, reasoning, is, done, automatically, without, conscious, effort, on, the, part, of, the, individual, reasoning, is, carried, out, by, making, generalizations, from, past, experiences, and, applying, them, to, new, circumstances, learned, knowledge, is, acquired, to, make, more, accurate, inferences, about, the, subject, deductive, reasoning, infers, conclusions, that, are, true, based, on, logical, premises, while, inductive, reasoning, infers, what, conclusions, are, likely, to, be, true, based, on, context, emotion, is, a, cognitive, experience, innate, to, humans, basic, emotions, such, as, joy, distress, anger, fear, surprise, and, disgust, are, common, to, all, cultures, though, social, norms, regarding, the, expression, of, emotion, may, vary, other, emotions, come, from, higher, cognition, such, as, love, guilt, shame, embarrassment, pride, envy, and, jealousy, these, emotions, develop, over, time, rather, than, instantly, and, are, more, strongly, influenced, by, cultural, factors, emotions, are, influenced, by, sensory, information, such, as, color, and, music, and, moods, of, happiness, and, sadness, humans, typically, maintain, a, standard, level, of, happiness, or, sadness, determined, by, health, and, social, relationships, though, positive, and, negative, events, have, short, term, influences, on, mood, humans, often, seek, to, improve, the, moods, of, one, another, through, consolation, entertainment, and, venting, humans, can, also, self, regulate, mood, through, exercise, and, meditation, creativity, is, the, use, of, previous, ideas, or, resources, to, produce, something, original, it, allows, for, innovation, adaptation, to, change, learning, new, information, and, novel, problem, solving, expression, of, creativity, also, supports, quality, of, life, creativity, includes, personal, creativity, in, which, a, person, presents, new, ideas, authentically, but, it, can, also, be, expanded, to, social, creativity, in, which, a, community, or, society, produces, and, recognizes, ideas, collectively, creativity, is, applied, in, typical, human, life, to, solve, problems, as, they, occur, it, also, leads, humans, to, carry, out, art, and, science, individuals, engaging, in, advanced, creative, work, typically, have, specialized, knowledge, in, that, field, and, humans, draw, on, this, knowledge, to, develop, novel, ideas, in, art, creativity, is, used, to, develop, new, artistic, works, such, as, visual, art, or, music, in, science, those, with, knowledge, in, a, particular, scientific, field, can, use, trial, and, error, to, develop, theories, that, more, accurately, explain, phenomena, religious, behavior, is, a, set, of, traditions, that, are, followed, based, on, the, teachings, of, a, religious, belief, system, the, nature, of, religious, behavior, varies, depending, on, the, specific, religious, traditions, most, religious, traditions, involve, variations, of, telling, myths, practicing, rituals, making, certain, things, taboo, adopting, symbolism, determining, morality, experiencing, altered, states, of, consciousness, and, believing, in, supernatural, beings, religious, behavior, is, often, demanding, and, has, high, time, energy, and, material, costs, and, it, conflicts, with, rational, choice, models, of, human, behavior, though, it, does, provide, community, related, benefits, anthropologists, offer, competing, theories, as, to, why, humans, adopted, religious, behavior, religious, behavior, is, heavily, influenced, by, social, factors, and, group, involvement, is, significant, in, the, development, of, an, individual, s, religious, behavior, social, structures, such, as, religious, organizations, or, family, units, allow, the, sharing, and, coordination, of, religious, behavior, these, social, connections, reinforce, the, cognitive, behaviors, associated, with, religion, encouraging, orthodoxy, and, commitment, according, to, a, pew, research, center, report, 54, of, adults, around, the, world, state, that, religion, is, very, important, in, their, lives, as, of, 2018, humans, undergo, many, behaviors, common, to, animals, to, support, the, processes, of, the, human, body, humans, eat, food, to, obtain, nutrition, these, foods, may, be, chosen, for, their, nutritional, value, but, they, may, also, be, eaten, for, pleasure, eating, often, follows, a, food, preparation, process, to, make, it, more, enjoyable, humans, dispose, of, waste, through, urination, and, defecation, excrement, is, often, treated, as, taboo, particularly, in, developed, and, urban, communities, where, sanitation, is, more, widely, available, and, excrement, has, no, value, as, fertilizer, humans, also, regularly, engage, in, sleep, based, on, homeostatic, and, circadian, factors, the, circadian, rhythm, causes, humans, to, require, sleep, at, a, regular, pattern, and, is, typically, calibrated, to, the, day, night, cycle, and, sleep, wake, habits, homeostasis, is, also, maintained, causing, longer, sleep, longer, after, periods, of, sleep, deprivation, the, human, sleep, cycle, takes, place, over, 90, minutes, and, it, repeats, 3, 5, times, during, normal, sleep, there, are, also, unique, behaviors, that, humans, undergo, to, maintain, physical, health, humans, have, developed, medicine, to, prevent, and, treat, illnesses, in, industrialized, nations, eating, habits, that, favor, better, nutrition, hygienic, behaviors, that, promote, sanitation, medical, treatment, to, eradicate, diseases, and, the, use, of, birth, control, significantly, improve, human, health, humans, can, also, engage, in, exercise, beyond, that, required, for, survival, to, maintain, health, humans, engage, in, hygiene, to, limit, exposure, to, dirt, and, pathogens, some, of, these, behaviors, are, adaptive, while, others, are, learned, basic, behaviors, of, disgust, evolved, as, an, adaptation, to, prevent, contact, with, sources, of, pathogens, resulting, in, a, biological, aversion, to, feces, body, fluids, rotten, food, and, animals, that, are, commonly, disease, vectors, personal, grooming, disposal, of, human, corpses, use, of, sewerage, and, use, of, cleaning, agents, are, hygienic, behaviors, common, to, most, human, societies, humans, reproduce, sexually, engaging, in, sexual, intercourse, for, both, reproduction, and, sexual, pleasure, human, reproduction, is, closely, associated, with, human, sexuality, and, an, instinctive, desire, to, procreate, though, humans, are, unique, in, that, they, intentionally, control, the, number, of, offspring, that, they, produce, humans, engage, in, a, large, variety, of, reproductive, behaviors, relative, to, other, animals, with, various, mating, structures, that, include, forms, of, monogamy, polygyny, and, polyandry, how, humans, engage, in, mating, behavior, is, heavily, influenced, by, cultural, norms, and, customs, unlike, most, mammals, human, women, ovulate, spontaneously, rather, than, seasonally, with, a, menstrual, cycle, that, typically, lasts, 25, 35, days, humans, are, bipedal, and, move, by, walking, human, walking, corresponds, to, the, bipedal, gait, cycle, which, involves, alternating, heel, contact, and, toe, off, with, the, ground, and, slight, elevation, and, rotation, of, the, pelvis, balance, while, walking, is, learned, during, the, first, 7, 9, years, of, life, and, individual, humans, develop, unique, gaits, while, learning, to, displace, weight, adjust, center, of, mass, and, coordinate, neural, control, with, movement, humans, can, achieve, higher, speed, by, running, the, endurance, running, hypothesis, proposes, that, humans, can, outpace, most, other, animals, over, long, distances, through, running, though, human, running, causes, a, higher, rate, of, energy, exertion, the, human, body, self, regulates, through, perspiration, during, periods, of, exertion, allowing, humans, more, endurance, than, other, animals, the, human, hand, is, prehensile, and, capable, of, grasping, objects, and, applying, force, with, control, over, the, hand, s, dexterity, and, grip, strength, this, allows, the, use, of, complex, tools, by, humans, humans, engage, in, predictable, behaviors, when, considering, economic, decisions, and, these, behaviors, may, or, may, not, be, rational, humans, make, basic, decisions, through, cost, benefit, analysis, and, the, acceptable, rate, of, return, at, the, minimum, risk, human, economic, decision, making, is, often, reference, dependent, in, which, options, are, weighed, in, reference, to, the, status, quo, rather, than, absolute, gains, and, losses, humans, are, also, loss, averse, fearing, loss, rather, than, seeking, gain, advanced, economic, behavior, developed, in, humans, after, the, neolithic, revolution, and, the, development, of, agriculture, these, developments, led, to, a, sustainable, supply, of, resources, that, allowed, specialization, in, more, complex, societies, the, nature, of, human, work, is, defined, by, the, complexity, of, society, the, simplest, societies, are, tribes, that, work, primarily, for, sustenance, as, hunter, gatherers, in, this, sense, work, is, not, a, distinct, activity, but, a, constant, that, makes, up, all, parts, of, life, as, all, members, of, the, society, must, work, consistently, to, stay, alive, more, advanced, societies, developed, after, the, neolithic, revolution, emphasizing, work, in, agricultural, and, pastoral, settings, in, these, societies, production, is, increased, ending, the, need, for, constant, work, and, allowing, some, individuals, to, specialize, and, work, in, areas, outside, of, food, production, this, also, created, non, laborious, work, as, increasing, occupational, complexity, required, some, individuals, to, specialize, in, technical, knowledge, and, administration, laborious, work, in, these, societies, has, variously, been, carried, out, by, slaves, serfs, peasants, and, guild, craftsmen, the, nature, of, work, changed, significantly, during, the, industrial, revolution, in, which, the, factory, system, was, developed, for, use, by, industrializing, nations, in, addition, to, further, increasing, general, quality, of, life, this, development, changed, the, dynamic, of, work, under, the, factory, system, workers, increasingly, collaborate, with, others, employers, serve, as, authority, figures, during, work, hours, and, forced, labor, is, largely, eradicated, further, changes, occur, in, post, industrial, societies, where, technological, advance, makes, industries, obsolete, replacing, them, with, mass, production, and, service, industries, humans, approach, work, differently, based, on, both, physical, and, personal, attributes, and, some, work, with, more, effectiveness, and, commitment, than, others, some, find, work, to, contribute, to, personal, fulfillment, while, others, work, only, out, of, necessity, work, can, also, serve, as, an, identity, with, individuals, identifying, themselves, based, on, their, occupation, work, motivation, is, complex, both, contributing, to, and, subtracting, from, various, human, needs, the, primary, motivation, for, work, is, for, material, gain, which, takes, the, form, of, money, in, modern, societies, it, may, also, serve, to, create, self, esteem, and, personal, worth, provide, activity, gain, respect, and, express, creativity, modern, work, is, typically, categorized, as, laborious, or, blue, collar, work, and, non, laborious, or, white, collar, work, leisure, is, activity, or, lack, of, activity, that, takes, place, outside, of, work, it, provides, relaxation, entertainment, and, improved, quality, of, life, for, individuals, engaging, in, leisure, can, be, beneficial, for, physical, and, mental, health, it, may, be, used, to, seek, temporary, relief, from, psychological, stress, to, produce, positive, emotions, or, to, facilitate, social, interaction, however, leisure, can, also, facilitate, health, risks, and, negative, emotions, caused, by, boredom, substance, abuse, or, high, risk, behavior, leisure, may, be, defined, as, serious, or, casual, serious, leisure, behaviors, involve, non, professional, pursuit, of, arts, and, sciences, the, development, of, hobbies, or, career, volunteering, in, an, area, of, expertise, casual, leisure, behaviors, provide, short, term, gratification, but, they, do, not, provide, long, term, gratification, or, personal, identity, these, include, play, relaxation, casual, social, interaction, volunteering, passive, entertainment, active, entertainment, and, sensory, stimulation, passive, entertainment, is, typically, derived, from, mass, media, which, may, include, written, works, or, digital, media, active, entertainment, involves, games, in, which, individuals, participate, sensory, stimulation, is, immediate, gratification, from, behaviors, such, as, eating, or, sexual, intercourse, humans, operate, as, consumers, that, obtain, and, use, goods, all, production, is, ultimately, designed, for, consumption, and, consumers, adapt, their, behavior, based, on, the, availability, of, production, mass, consumption, began, during, the, industrial, revolution, caused, by, the, development, of, new, technologies, that, allowed, for, increased, production, many, factors, affect, a, consumer, s, decision, to, purchase, goods, through, trade, they, may, consider, the, nature, of, the, product, its, associated, cost, the, convenience, of, purchase, and, the, nature, of, advertising, around, the, product, cultural, factors, may, influence, this, decision, as, different, cultures, value, different, things, and, subcultures, may, have, different, priorities, when, it, comes, to, purchasing, decisions, social, class, including, wealth, education, and, occupation, may, affect, one, s, purchasing, behavior, a, consumer, s, interpersonal, relationships, and, reference, groups, may, also, influence, purchasing, behavior, like, all, living, things, humans, live, in, ecosystems, and, interact, with, other, organisms, human, behavior, is, affected, by, the, environment, in, which, a, human, lives, and, environments, are, affected, by, human, habitation, humans, have, also, developed, man, made, ecosystems, such, as, urban, areas, and, agricultural, land, geography, and, landscape, ecology, determine, how, humans, are, distributed, within, an, ecosystem, both, naturally, and, through, planned, urban, morphology, humans, exercise, control, over, the, animals, that, live, within, their, environment, domesticated, animals, are, trained, and, cared, for, by, humans, humans, can, develop, social, and, emotional, bonds, with, animals, in, their, care, pets, are, kept, for, companionship, within, human, homes, including, dogs, and, cats, that, have, been, bred, for, domestication, over, many, centuries, livestock, animals, such, as, cattle, sheep, goats, and, poultry, are, kept, on, agricultural, land, to, produce, animal, products, domesticated, animals, are, also, kept, in, laboratories, for, animal, testing, non, domesticated, animals, are, sometimes, kept, in, nature, reserves, and, zoos, for, tourism, and, conservation, human, behavior, is, influenced, by, biological, and, cultural, elements, the, structure, and, agency, debate, considers, whether, human, behavior, is, predominantly, led, by, individual, human, impulses, or, by, external, structural, forces, behavioral, genetics, considers, how, human, behavior, is, affected, by, inherited, traits, though, genes, do, not, guarantee, certain, behaviors, certain, traits, can, be, inherited, that, make, individuals, more, likely, to, engage, in, certain, behaviors, or, express, certain, personalities, an, individual, s, environment, can, also, affect, behavior, often, in, conjunction, with, genetic, factors, an, individual, s, personality, and, attitudes, affect, how, behaviors, are, expressed, formed, in, conjunction, by, genetic, and, environmental, factors, infants, are, limited, in, their, ability, to, interpret, their, surroundings, shortly, after, birth, object, permanence, and, understanding, of, motion, typically, develop, within, the, first, six, months, of, an, infant, s, life, though, the, specific, cognitive, processes, are, not, understood, the, ability, to, mentally, categorize, different, concepts, and, objects, that, they, perceive, also, develops, within, the, first, year, infants, are, quickly, able, to, discern, their, body, from, their, surroundings, and, often, take, interest, in, their, own, limbs, or, actions, they, cause, by,
