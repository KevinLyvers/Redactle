a, referendum, pl, referendums, or, less, commonly, referenda, is, a, direct, vote, by, the, electorate, on, a, proposal, law, or, political, issue, this, is, in, contrast, to, an, issue, being, voted, on, by, a, representative, this, may, result, in, the, adoption, of, a, new, policy, or, specific, law, or, the, referendum, may, be, only, advisory, in, some, countries, it, is, synonymous, with, and, also, known, as, plebiscite, votation, popular, consultation, ballot, question, ballot, measure, or, proposition, some, definitions, of, plebiscite, suggest, it, is, a, type, of, vote, to, change, the, constitution, or, government, of, a, country, the, word, referendum, is, often, a, catchall, used, for, both, legislative, referrals, and, initiatives, referendum, is, the, gerundive, form, of, the, latin, verb, referre, literally, to, carry, back, from, the, verb, ferre, to, bear, bring, carry, plus, the, inseparable, prefix, re, here, meaning, back, as, a, gerundive, is, an, adjective, not, a, noun, it, cannot, be, used, alone, in, latin, and, must, be, contained, within, a, context, attached, to, a, noun, such, as, propositum, quod, referendum, est, populo, a, proposal, which, must, be, carried, back, to, the, people, the, addition, of, the, verb, sum, 3rd, person, singular, est, to, a, gerundive, denotes, the, idea, of, necessity, or, compulsion, that, which, must, be, done, rather, than, that, which, is, fit, for, doing, its, use, as, a, noun, in, english, is, not, considered, a, strictly, grammatical, usage, of, a, foreign, word, but, is, rather, a, newly, coined, english, noun, which, follows, english, grammatical, usage, not, latin, grammatical, usage, this, determines, the, form, of, the, plural, in, english, which, according, to, english, grammar, should, be, referendums, the, use, of, referenda, as, a, plural, form, in, english, treating, it, as, a, latin, word, and, attempting, to, apply, to, it, the, rules, of, latin, grammar, is, unsupportable, according, to, the, rules, of, both, latin, and, english, grammar, the, use, of, referenda, as, a, plural, form, is, posited, hypothetically, as, either, a, gerund, or, a, gerundive, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, which, rules, out, such, usage, in, both, cases, as, follows, referendums, is, logically, preferable, as, a, plural, form, meaning, ballots, on, one, issue, as, a, latin, gerund, referendum, has, no, plural, the, latin, plural, gerundive, referenda, meaning, things, to, be, referred, necessarily, connotes, a, plurality, of, issues, it, is, closely, related, to, agenda, those, matters, which, must, be, driven, forward, from, ago, to, impel, or, drive, forwards, and, memorandum, that, matter, which, must, be, remembered, from, memoro, to, call, to, mind, corrigenda, from, rego, to, rule, make, straight, those, things, which, must, be, made, straight, corrected, etc, the, term, plebiscite, has, a, generally, similar, meaning, in, modern, usage, and, comes, from, the, latin, plebiscita, which, originally, meant, a, decree, of, the, concilium, plebis, plebeian, council, the, popular, assembly, of, the, roman, republic, today, a, referendum, can, also, often, be, referred, to, as, a, plebiscite, but, in, some, countries, the, two, terms, are, used, differently, to, refer, to, votes, with, differing, types, of, legal, consequences, in, australia, a, referendum, is, often, said, to, be, a, vote, to, change, the, federal, constitution, and, plebiscite, a, vote, which, does, not, affect, the, federal, constitution, however, this, is, erroneous, as, not, all, federal, referendums, have, been, on, constitutional, matters, such, as, the, 1916, australian, conscription, referendum, and, state, votes, that, likewise, do, not, affect, either, the, federal, or, state, constitution, are, frequently, said, to, be, referendums, such, as, the, 2009, western, australian, daylight, saving, referendum, historically, they, are, used, by, australians, interchangeably, and, a, plebiscite, was, considered, another, name, for, a, referendum, in, ireland, plebiscite, referred, to, the, vote, to, adopt, its, constitution, but, a, subsequent, vote, to, amend, the, constitution, is, called, a, referendum, as, is, a, poll, of, the, electorate, on, a, non, constitutional, bill, the, name, and, use, of, the, referendum, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, swiss, canton, of, graub, nden, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, after, a, reduction, in, the, number, of, referendums, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, the, referendum, as, a, political, tool, has, been, increasing, in, popularity, since, the, 1970s, this, increase, has, been, attributed, to, dealignment, of, the, public, with, political, parties, as, specific, policy, issues, became, more, important, to, the, public, than, party, identifiers, the, term, referendum, covers, a, variety, of, different, meanings, and, the, terminology, is, different, depending, on, the, us, that, holds, them, a, referendum, can, be, binding, or, advisory, in, some, countries, different, names, are, used, for, these, two, types, of, referendum, referendums, can, be, further, classified, by, who, initiates, them, david, altman, proposes, four, dimensions, that, referendums, can, be, classified, by, a, mandatory, referendum, is, a, class, of, referendum, required, to, be, voted, on, if, certain, conditions, are, met, or, for, certain, government, actions, to, be, taken, they, do, not, require, any, signatures, from, the, public, in, areas, that, use, referendums, a, mandatory, referendum, is, commonly, used, as, a, legally, required, step, for, ratification, for, constitutional, changes, ratifying, international, treaties, and, joining, international, organizations, and, certain, types, of, public, spending, typical, types, of, mandatory, referendums, include, an, optional, referendum, is, a, class, of, referendums, that, is, put, to, the, vote, as, a, result, of, a, demand, this, may, come, from, the, executive, branch, legislative, branch, or, a, request, from, the, people, often, after, meeting, a, signature, requirement, types, of, optional, referendums, include, from, a, political, philosophical, perspective, referendums, are, an, expression, of, direct, democracy, but, today, most, referendums, need, to, be, understood, within, the, context, of, representative, democracy, they, tend, to, be, used, quite, selectively, covering, issues, such, as, changes, in, voting, systems, where, currently, elected, officials, may, not, have, the, legitimacy, or, inclination, to, implement, such, changes, since, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, hundreds, of, national, referendums, have, been, organised, in, the, world, almost, 600, national, votes, have, been, held, in, switzerland, since, its, inauguration, as, a, modern, state, in, 1848, italy, ranks, second, with, 78, national, referendums, 72, popular, referendums, 51, of, which, were, proposed, by, the, radical, party, 4, constitutional, referendums, one, institutional, referendum, and, one, advisory, referendum, a, referendum, usually, offers, the, electorate, a, straight, choice, between, accepting, or, rejecting, a, proposal, however, some, referendums, give, voters, multiple, choices, and, some, use, transferable, voting, this, has, also, been, called, a, preferendum, when, the, choices, given, allow, the, voters, to, weight, their, support, for, a, policy, in, switzerland, for, example, multiple, choice, referendums, are, common, two, multiple, choice, referendums, were, held, in, sweden, in, 1957, and, in, 1980, in, which, voters, were, offered, three, options, in, 1977, a, referendum, held, in, australia, to, determine, a, new, national, anthem, was, held, in, which, voters, had, four, choices, in, 1992, new, zealand, held, a, five, option, referendum, on, their, electoral, system, in, 1982, guam, had, a, referendum, that, used, six, options, with, an, additional, blank, option, for, those, wishing, to, campaign, and, vote, for, their, own, seventh, option, a, multiple, choice, referendum, poses, the, question, of, how, the, result, is, to, be, determined, they, may, be, set, up, so, that, if, no, single, option, receives, the, support, of, an, absolute, majority, more, than, half, of, the, votes, resort, can, be, made, to, the, two, round, system, or, instant, runoff, voting, which, is, also, called, irv, and, pv, in, 2018, the, irish, citizens, assembly, considered, the, conduct, of, future, referendums, in, ireland, with, 76, of, the, members, in, favour, of, allowing, more, than, two, options, and, 52, favouring, preferential, voting, in, such, cases, other, people, regard, a, non, majoritarian, methodology, like, the, modified, borda, count, mbc, as, more, inclusive, and, more, accurate, swiss, referendums, offer, a, separate, vote, on, each, of, the, multiple, options, as, well, as, an, additional, decision, about, which, of, the, multiple, options, should, be, preferred, in, the, swedish, case, in, both, referendums, the, winning, option, was, chosen, by, the, single, member, plurality, first, past, the, post, system, in, other, words, the, winning, option, was, deemed, to, be, that, supported, by, a, plurality, rather, than, an, absolute, majority, of, voters, in, the, 1977, australian, referendum, the, winner, was, chosen, by, the, system, of, preferential, instant, runoff, voting, irv, polls, in, newfoundland, 1949, and, guam, 1982, for, example, were, counted, under, a, form, of, the, two, round, system, and, an, unusual, form, of, trs, was, used, in, the, 1992, new, zealand, poll, although, california, has, not, held, multiple, choice, referendums, in, the, swiss, or, swedish, sense, in, which, only, one, of, several, counter, propositions, can, be, victorious, and, the, losing, proposals, are, wholly, null, and, void, it, does, have, so, many, yes, or, no, referendums, at, each, election, day, that, conflicts, arise, the, state, s, constitution, provides, a, method, for, resolving, conflicts, when, two, or, more, inconsistent, propositions, are, passed, on, the, same, day, this, is, a, de, facto, form, of, approval, voting, i, e, the, proposition, with, the, most, yes, votes, prevails, over, the, others, to, the, extent, of, any, conflict, other, voting, systems, that, could, be, used, in, multiple, choice, referendum, are, condorcet, method, and, quadratic, voting, including, quadratic, funding, quorums, are, typically, introduced, to, prevent, referendum, results, from, being, skewed, by, low, turnout, or, decided, by, a, motivated, minority, of, voters, referendums, may, require, a, turnout, threshold, also, called, a, participation, quorum, in, order, for, the, referendum, to, be, considered, legally, valid, in, a, participation, quorum, a, majority, of, those, voting, must, approve, of, the, referendum, and, a, certain, percentage, of, population, must, have, voted, in, order, for, the, results, to, be, approved, the, usage, of, participation, quorums, in, referendums, is, controversial, as, higher, requirements, have, been, shown, to, reduced, turnout, and, voter, participation, with, high, participation, quorums, the, opposition, of, a, referendum, has, an, interest, in, abstaining, from, the, vote, instead, of, participating, in, order, to, invalidate, the, referendum, results, through, low, turnout, this, is, a, form, of, the, no, show, paradox, all, others, who, are, not, voting, for, other, reasons, including, those, with, no, opinion, are, effectively, also, voting, against, the, referendum, in, the, 2005, italian, fertility, laws, referendum, opposition, to, the, proposed, loosening, of, laws, on, research, on, embryos, and, on, allowing, in, vitro, fertilization, campaigned, for, people, to, abstain, from, voting, to, drive, down, turnout, although, a, majority, of, people, voted, yes, for, the, changes, in, the, law, the, results, were, invalid, because, participation, was, low, important, referendums, are, frequently, challenged, in, courts, in, pre, referendum, disputes, plaintiffs, have, often, tried, to, prevent, the, referendum, to, take, place, in, one, such, challenge, in, 2017, the, spanish, constitutional, court, suspended, the, catalonia, s, independence, referendum, in, post, referendum, disputes, they, challenge, the, result, british, courts, dismissed, post, referendum, challenges, of, the, brexit, referendum, international, tribunals, have, traditionally, not, interfered, with, referendum, disputes, in, 2021, the, european, court, of, human, rights, extended, its, jurisdiction, to, referendums, in, its, judgment, toplak, and, mrak, v, slovenia, initiated, by, two, disabled, voters, over, polling, place, access, in, political, governance, states, that, voters, in, a, referendum, are, more, likely, to, be, driven, by, transient, whims, than, by, careful, deliberation, or, that, they, are, not, sufficiently, informed, to, make, decisions, on, complicated, or, technical, issues, also, voters, might, be, swayed, by, propaganda, strong, personalities, intimidation, and, expensive, advertising, campaigns, james, madison, argued, that, direct, democracy, is, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, some, opposition, to, the, referendum, has, arisen, from, its, use, by, dictators, such, as, adolf, hitler, and, benito, mussolini, who, it, is, argued, used, the, plebiscite, to, disguise, oppressive, policies, as, populism, dictators, may, also, make, use, of, referendums, as, well, as, show, elections, to, further, legitimize, their, authority, such, as, ant, nio, de, oliveira, salazar, in, 1933, benito, mussolini, in, 1934, adolf, hitler, in, 1934, 1936, francisco, franco, in, 1947, park, chung, hee, in, 1972, and, ferdinand, marcos, in, 1973, hitler, s, use, of, plebiscites, is, argued, as, the, reason, why, since, world, war, ii, there, has, been, no, provision, in, germany, for, the, holding, of, referendums, at, the, federal, level, in, recent, years, referendums, have, been, used, strategically, by, several, european, governments, trying, to, pursue, political, and, electoral, goals, in, 1995, john, bruton, considered, that, all, governments, are, unpopular, given, the, chance, people, would, vote, against, them, in, a, referendum, therefore, avoid, referendums, therefore, don, t, raise, questions, which, require, them, such, as, the, big, versus, the, little, states, some, critics, of, the, referendum, attack, the, use, of, closed, questions, a, difficulty, called, the, separability, problem, can, plague, a, referendum, on, two, or, more, issues, if, one, issue, is, in, fact, or, in, perception, related, to, another, on, the, ballot, the, imposed, simultaneous, voting, of, first, preference, on, each, issue, can, result, in, an, outcome, which, is, displeasing, to, most, several, commentators, have, noted, that, the, use, of, citizens, initiatives, to, amend, constitutions, has, so, tied, the, government, to, a, jumble, of, popular, demands, as, to, render, the, government, unworkable, a, 2009, article, in, the, economist, argued, that, this, had, restricted, the, ability, of, the, california, state, government, to, tax, the, people, and, pass, the, budget, and, called, for, an, entirely, new, californian, constitution, a, similar, problem, also, arises, when, elected, governments, accumulate, excessive, debts, that, can, severely, reduce, the, effective, margin, for, later, governments, both, these, problems, can, be, moderated, by, a, combination, of, other, measures, as
