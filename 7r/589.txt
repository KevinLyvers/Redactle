to, english, via, middle, french, magasin, and, italian, magazzino, in, its, original, sense, the, word, magazine, referred, to, a, storage, space, or, device, in, the, case, of, written, publication, it, refers, to, a, collection, of, written, articles, this, explains, why, magazine, publications, share, the, term, with, storage, units, for, military, equipment, such, as, gunpowder, artillery, and, firearm, magazines, and, in, french, and, russian, adopted, from, french, as, retailers, such, as, department, stores, print, magazines, can, be, distributed, through, the, mail, through, sales,

in, this, model, the, magazine, is, sold, to, readers, for, a, price, either, on, a, per, issue, basis, or, by, subscription, where, an, annual, fee, or, monthly, price, is, paid, and, issues, are, sent, by, post, to, readers, paid, circulation, allows, for, defined, readership, statistics, this, means, that, there, is, no, cover, price, and, issues, are, given, away, for, example, in, street, dispensers, airline, or, included, with, other, products, or, publications, because, this, model, involves, giving, issues, away, to, unspecific, populations, the, statistics, only, entail, the, number, of, issues, distributed, and, not, who, reads, them, this, is, the, model, used, by, many, trade, magazines, industry, based, periodicals, distributed, only, to, qualifying, readers, often, for, free, and, determined, by, some, form, of, survey, because, of, costs, e, g, printing, and, postage, associated, with, the, medium, of, print, publishers, may, not, distribute, free, copies, to, everyone, who, requests, one, unqualified, leads, instead, they, operate, under, controlled, circulation, deciding, who, may, receive, free, subscriptions, based, on, each, person, s, qualification, as, a, member, of, the, trade, and, likelihood, of, buying, for, example, likelihood, of, having, corporate, purchasing, authority, as, determined, from, job, title, this, allows, a, high, level, of, certainty, that, advertisements, will, be, received, by, the, advertiser, s, target, audience, and, it, avoids, wasted, printing, and, distribution, expenses, this, latter, model, was, widely, used, before, the, rise, of, the, world, wide, web, and, is, still, employed, by, some, titles, for, example, in, the, united, kingdom, a, number, of, computer, industry, magazines, use, this, model,

historique, 1650, 1660, 1665, the, french, press, lagged, a, generation, behind, the, british, for, they, catered, to, the, needs, of, the, aristocracy, while, the, newer, british, counterparts, were, oriented, toward, the, middle, and, working, classes, periodicals, were, censored, by, the, central, government, in, paris, they, were, not, totally, quiescent, politically, often, they, criticized,

times, of, political, crisis, they, expressed, and, helped, shape, the, views, of, their, readership, and, thereby, were, major, elements, in, the, changing, political, culture, for, example, there, were, eight, catholic, periodicals, in, 1830, in, paris, none, were, officially, owned, or, sponsored, by, the, church, and, they, reflected, a, range, of, opinion, among, educated, catholics, about, current, issues, such, as, the, 1830, july, revolution, that, overthrew, the, bourbon, monarchy, several, were, strong, supporters, of, the, bourbon, kings, but, all, eight, ultimately, urged, support, for, the, new, government, putting, their, appeals, in, terms, of, preserving, civil, order, they, often, discussed, the, relationship, between, church, and, state, generally, they, urged, priests, to, focus, on, spiritual, matters, and, not, engage, in, politics, historian, m, patricia, dougherty, says, this, process, created, a, distance, between, the, church, and, the, new, monarch, and, enabled, catholics, to, develop, a, new, understanding, of, church, state, relationships, and, the, source, of, political, authority, the, moniteur, ottoman, was, a, gazette, written, in, french,

the, development, of, the, magazines, stimulated, an, increase, in, literary, criticism, and, political, debate, moving, towards, more, opinionated, pieces, from, the, objective, newspapers, the, increased, time, between, prints, and, the, greater, amount, of, space, to, write, provided, a, forum, for, public, arguments, by, scholars, and, critical, observers, the, early, periodical,
