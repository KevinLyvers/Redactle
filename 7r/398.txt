greek, modern, greek, romanized, ellinik, pronounced, ancient, greek, romanized, hell, nik, is, an, indo, european, language, constituting, an, independent, branch, of, it, native, to, greece, cyprus, italy, in, calabria, and, salento, southern, albania, and, other, regions, of, the, balkans, caucasus, the, black, sea, coast, asia, minor, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, it, has, the, longest, documented, history, of, any, indo, european, language, spanning, at, least, 3, 400, years, of, written, records, its, writing, system, is, the, greek, alphabet, which, has, been, used, for, approximately, 2, 800, years, previously, greek, was, recorded, in, writing, systems, such, as, linear, b, and, the, cypriot, syllabary, the, alphabet, arose, from, the, phoenician, script, and, was, in, turn, the, basis, of, the, latin, cyrillic, coptic, gothic, and, many, other, writing, systems, the, greek, language, holds, a, very, important, place, in, the, history, of, the, western, world, beginning, with, the, epics, of, homer, ancient, greek, literature, includes, many, works, of, lasting, importance, in, the, european, canon, greek, is, also, the, language, in, which, many, of, the, foundational, texts, in, science, and, philosophy, were, originally, composed, the, new, testament, of, the, christian, bible, was, also, originally, written, in, greek, together, with, the, latin, texts, and, traditions, of, the, roman, world, the, greek, texts, and, greek, societies, of, antiquity, constitute, the, objects, of, study, of, the, discipline, of, classics, during, antiquity, greek, was, by, far, the, most, widely, spoken, lingua, franca, in, the, mediterranean, world, it, eventually, became, the, official, language, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, developed, into, medieval, greek, in, its, modern, form, greek, is, the, official, language, of, greece, and, cyprus, and, one, of, the, 24, official, languages, of, the, european, union, it, is, spoken, by, at, least, 13, 5, million, people, today, in, greece, cyprus, italy, albania, turkey, and, the, many, other, countries, of, the, greek, diaspora, greek, roots, have, been, widely, used, for, centuries, and, continue, to, be, widely, used, to, coin, new, words, in, other, languages, greek, and, latin, are, the, predominant, sources, of, international, scientific, vocabulary, greek, has, been, spoken, in, the, balkan, peninsula, since, around, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, or, possibly, earlier, the, earliest, written, evidence, is, a, linear, b, clay, tablet, found, in, messenia, that, dates, to, between, 1450, and, 1350, bc, making, greek, the, world, s, oldest, recorded, living, language, among, the, indo, european, languages, its, date, of, earliest, written, attestation, is, matched, only, by, the, now, extinct, anatolian, languages, the, greek, language, is, conventionally, divided, into, the, following, periods, in, the, modern, era, the, greek, language, entered, a, state, of, diglossia, the, coexistence, of, vernacular, and, archaizing, written, forms, of, the, language, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, greek, language, question, was, a, polarization, between, two, competing, varieties, of, modern, greek, dimotiki, the, vernacular, form, of, modern, greek, proper, and, katharevousa, meaning, purified, a, compromise, between, dimotiki, and, ancient, greek, developed, in, the, early, 19th, century, that, was, used, for, literary, and, official, purposes, in, the, newly, formed, greek, state, in, 1976, dimotiki, was, declared, the, official, language, of, greece, after, having, incorporated, features, of, katharevousa, and, thus, giving, birth, to, standard, modern, greek, used, today, for, all, official, purposes, and, in, education, the, historical, unity, and, continuing, identity, between, the, various, stages, of, the, greek, language, are, often, emphasized, although, greek, has, undergone, morphological, and, phonological, changes, comparable, to, those, seen, in, other, languages, never, since, classical, antiquity, has, its, cultural, literary, and, orthographic, tradition, been, interrupted, to, the, extent, that, one, can, speak, of, a, new, language, emerging, greek, speakers, today, still, tend, to, regard, literary, works, of, ancient, greek, as, part, of, their, own, rather, than, a, foreign, language, it, is, also, often, stated, that, the, historical, changes, have, been, relatively, slight, compared, with, some, other, languages, according, to, one, estimation, homeric, greek, is, probably, closer, to, demotic, than, 12, century, middle, english, is, to, modern, spoken, english, greek, is, spoken, today, by, at, least, 13, million, people, principally, in, greece, and, cyprus, along, with, a, sizable, greek, speaking, minority, in, albania, near, the, greek, albanian, border, a, significant, percentage, of, albania, s, population, has, knowledge, of, the, greek, language, due, in, part, to, the, albanian, wave, of, immigration, to, greece, in, the, 1980s, and, 90s, and, the, greek, community, in, the, country, prior, to, the, greco, turkish, war, and, the, resulting, population, exchange, in, 1923, a, very, large, population, of, greek, speakers, also, existed, in, turkey, though, very, few, remain, today, a, small, greek, speaking, community, is, also, found, in, bulgaria, near, the, greek, bulgarian, border, greek, is, also, spoken, worldwide, by, the, sizable, greek, diaspora, which, has, notable, communities, in, the, united, states, australia, canada, south, africa, chile, brazil, argentina, russia, ukraine, the, united, kingdom, and, throughout, the, european, union, especially, in, germany, historically, significant, greek, speaking, communities, and, regions, were, found, throughout, the, eastern, mediterranean, in, what, are, today, southern, italy, turkey, cyprus, syria, lebanon, israel, palestine, egypt, and, libya, in, the, area, of, the, black, sea, in, what, are, today, turkey, bulgaria, romania, ukraine, russia, georgia, armenia, and, azerbaijan, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, the, western, mediterranean, in, and, around, colonies, such, as, massalia, monoikos, and, mainake, it, was, also, used, as, the, official, language, of, government, and, religion, in, the, christian, nubian, kingdoms, for, most, of, their, history, greek, in, its, modern, form, is, the, official, language, of, greece, where, it, is, spoken, by, almost, the, entire, population, it, is, also, the, official, language, of, cyprus, nominally, alongside, turkish, and, the, british, overseas, territory, of, akrotiri, and, dhekelia, alongside, english, because, of, the, membership, of, greece, and, cyprus, in, the, european, union, greek, is, one, of, the, organization, s, 24, official, languages, greek, is, recognized, as, a, minority, language, in, albania, and, used, co, officially, in, some, of, its, municipalities, in, the, districts, of, gjirokast, r, and, sarand, it, is, also, an, official, minority, language, in, the, regions, of, apulia, and, calabria, in, italy, in, the, framework, of, the, european, charter, for, regional, or, minority, languages, greek, is, protected, and, promoted, officially, as, a, regional, and, minority, language, in, armenia, hungary, romania, and, ukraine, it, is, recognized, as, a, minority, language, and, protected, in, turkey, by, the, 1923, treaty, of, lausanne, the, phonology, morphology, syntax, and, vocabulary, of, the, language, show, both, conservative, and, innovative, tendencies, across, the, entire, attestation, of, the, language, from, the, ancient, to, the, modern, period, the, division, into, conventional, periods, is, as, with, all, such, periodizations, relatively, arbitrary, especially, because, in, all, periods, ancient, greek, has, enjoyed, high, prestige, and, the, literate, borrowed, heavily, from, it, across, its, history, the, syllabic, structure, of, greek, has, varied, little, greek, shows, a, mixed, syllable, structure, permitting, complex, syllabic, onsets, but, very, restricted, codas, it, has, only, oral, vowels, and, a, fairly, stable, set, of, consonantal, contrasts, the, main, phonological, changes, occurred, during, the, hellenistic, and, roman, period, see, koine, greek, phonology, for, details, in, all, its, stages, the, morphology, of, greek, shows, an, extensive, set, of, productive, derivational, affixes, a, limited, but, productive, system, of, compounding, and, a, rich, inflectional, system, although, its, morphological, categories, have, been, fairly, stable, over, time, morphological, changes, are, present, throughout, particularly, in, the, nominal, and, verbal, systems, the, major, change, in, the, nominal, morphology, since, the, classical, stage, was, the, disuse, of, the, dative, case, its, functions, being, largely, taken, over, by, the, genitive, the, verbal, system, has, lost, the, infinitive, the, synthetically, formed, future, and, perfect, tenses, and, the, optative, mood, many, have, been, replaced, by, periphrastic, analytical, forms, pronouns, show, distinctions, in, person, 1st, 2nd, and, 3rd, number, singular, dual, and, plural, in, the, ancient, language, singular, and, plural, alone, in, later, stages, and, gender, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, and, decline, for, case, from, six, cases, in, the, earliest, forms, attested, to, four, in, the, modern, language, nouns, articles, and, adjectives, show, all, the, distinctions, except, for, a, person, both, attributive, and, predicative, adjectives, agree, with, the, noun, the, inflectional, categories, of, the, greek, verb, have, likewise, remained, largely, the, same, over, the, course, of, the, language, s, history, but, with, significant, changes, in, the, number, of, distinctions, within, each, category, and, their, morphological, expression, greek, verbs, have, synthetic, inflectional, forms, for, many, aspects, of, the, syntax, of, greek, have, remained, constant, verbs, agree, with, their, subject, only, the, use, of, the, surviving, cases, is, largely, intact, nominative, for, subjects, and, predicates, accusative, for, objects, of, most, verbs, and, many, prepositions, genitive, for, possessors, articles, precede, nouns, adpositions, are, largely, prepositional, relative, clauses, follow, the, noun, they, modify, and, relative, pronouns, are, clause, initial, however, the, morphological, changes, also, have, their, counterparts, in, the, syntax, and, there, are, also, significant, differences, between, the, syntax, of, the, ancient, and, that, of, the, modern, form, of, the, language, ancient, greek, made, great, use, of, participial, constructions, and, of, constructions, involving, the, infinitive, and, the, modern, variety, lacks, the, infinitive, entirely, employing, a, raft, of, new, periphrastic, constructions, instead, and, uses, participles, more, restrictively, the, loss, of, the, dative, led, to, a, rise, of, prepositional, indirect, objects, and, the, use, of, the, genitive, to, directly, mark, these, as, well, ancient, greek, tended, to, be, verb, final, but, neutral, word, order, in, the, modern, language, is, vso, or, svo, modern, greek, inherits, most, of, its, vocabulary, from, ancient, greek, which, in, turn, is, an, indo, european, language, but, also, includes, a, number, of, borrowings, from, the, languages, of, the, populations, that, inhabited, greece, before, the, arrival, of, proto, greeks, some, documented, in, mycenaean, texts, they, include, a, large, number, of, greek, toponyms, the, form, and, meaning, of, many, words, have, changed, loanwords, words, of, foreign, origin, have, entered, the, language, mainly, from, latin, venetian, and, turkish, during, the, older, periods, of, greek, loanwords, into, greek, acquired, greek, inflections, thus, leaving, only, a, foreign, root, word, modern, borrowings, from, the, 20th, century, on, especially, from, french, and, english, are, typically, not, inflected, other, modern, borrowings, are, derived, from, albanian, south, slavic, macedonian, bulgarian, and, eastern, romance, languages, aromanian, and, megleno, romanian, greek, words, have, been, widely, borrowed, into, other, languages, including, english, example, words, include, mathematics, physics, astronomy, democracy, philosophy, athletics, theatre, rhetoric, baptism, evangelist, etc, moreover, greek, words, and, word, elements, continue, to, be, productive, as, a, basis, for, coinages, anthropology, photography, telephony, isomer, biomechanics, cinematography, etc, together, with, latin, words, they, form, the, foundation, of, international, scientific, and, technical, vocabulary, for, example, all, words, ending, in, logy, discourse, there, are, many, english, words, of, greek, origin, greek, is, an, independent, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, the, ancient, language, most, closely, related, to, it, may, be, ancient, macedonian, which, by, most, accounts, was, a, distinct, dialect, of, greek, itself, aside, from, the, macedonian, question, current, consensus, regards, phrygian, as, the, closest, relative, of, greek, since, they, share, a, number, of, phonological, morphological, and, lexical, isoglosses, with, some, being, exclusive, between, them, scholars, have, proposed, a, graeco, phrygian, subgroup, out, of, which, greek, and, phrygian, originated, among, living, languages, some, indo, europeanists, suggest, that, greek, may, be, most, closely, related, to, armenian, see, graeco, armenian, or, the, indo, iranian, languages, see, graeco, aryan, but, little, definitive, evidence, has, been, found, in, addition, albanian, has, also, been, considered, somewhat, related, to, greek, and, armenian, and, it, has, been, proposed, that, they, all, form, a, higher, order, subgroup, along, with, other, extinct, languages, of, the, ancient, balkans, this, higher, order, subgroup, is, usually, termed, palaeo, balkan, and, greek, has, a, central, position, in, it, linear, b, attested, as, early, as, the, late, 15th, century, bc, was, the, first, script, used, to, write, greek, it, is, basically, a, syllabary, which, was, finally, deciphered, by, michael, ventris, and, john, chadwick, in, the, 1950s, its, precursor, linear, a, has, not, been, deciphered, and, most, likely, encodes, a, non, greek, language, the, language, of, the, linear, b, texts, mycenaean, greek, is, the, earliest, known, form, of, greek, another, similar, system, used, to, write, the, greek, language, was, the, cypriot, syllabary, also, a, descendant, of, linear, a, via, the, intermediate, cypro, minoan, syllabary, which, is, closely, related, to, linear, b, but, uses, somewhat, different, syllabic, conventions, to, represent, phoneme, sequences, the, cypriot, syllabary, is, attested, in, cyprus, from, the, 11th, century, bc, until, its, gradual, abandonment, in, the, late, classical, period, in, favor, of, the, standard, greek, alphabet, greek, has, been, written, in, the, greek, alphabet, since, approximately, the, 9th, century, bc, it, was, created, by, modifying, the, phoenician, alphabet, with, the, innovation, of, adopting, certain, letters, to, represent, the, vowels, the, variant, of, the, alphabet, in, use, today, is, essentially, the, late, ionic, variant, introduced, for, writing, classical, attic, in, 403, bc, in, classical, greek, as, in, classical, latin, only, upper, case, letters, existed, the, lower, case, greek, letters, were, developed, much, later, by, medieval, scribes, to, permit, a, faster, more, convenient, cursive, writing, style, with, the, use, of, ink, and, quill, the, greek, alphabet, consists, of, 24, letters, each, with, an, uppercase, majuscule, and, lowercase, minuscule, form, the, letter, sigma, has, an, additional, lowercase, form, used, in, the, final, position, of, a, word, in, addition, to, the, letters, the, greek, alphabet, features, a, number, of, diacritical, signs, three, different, accent, marks, acute, grave, and, circumflex, originally, denoting, different, shapes, of, pitch, accent, on, the, stressed, vowel, the, so, called, breathing, marks, rough, and, smooth, breathing, originally, used, to, signal, presence, or, absence, of, word, initial, h, and, the, diaeresis, used, to, mark, the, full, syllabic, value, of, a, vowel, that, would, otherwise, be, read, as, part, of, a, diphthong, these, marks, were, introduced, during, the, course, of, the, hellenistic, period, actual, usage, of, the, grave, in, handwriting, saw, a, rapid, decline, in, favor, of, uniform, usage, of, the, acute, during, the, late, 20th, century, and, it, has, only, been, retained, in, typography, after, the, writing, reform, of, 1982, most, diacritics, are, no, longer, used, since, then, greek, has, been, written, mostly, in, the, simplified, monotonic, orthography, or, monotonic, system, which, employs, only, the, acute, accent, and, the, diaeresis, the, traditional, system, now, called, the, polytonic, orthography, or, polytonic, system, is, still, used, internationally, for, the, writing, of, ancient, greek, in, greek, the, question, mark, is, written, as, the, english, semicolon, while, the, functions, of, the, colon, and, semicolon, are, performed, by, a, raised, point, known, as, the, ano, teleia, in, greek, the, comma, also, functions, as, a, silent, letter, in, a, handful, of, greek, words, principally, distinguishing, ti, whatever, from, ti, that, ancient, greek, texts, often, used, scriptio, continua, continuous, writing, which, means, that, ancient, authors, and, scribes, would, write, word, after, word, with, no, spaces, or, punctuation, between, words, to, differentiate, or, mark, boundaries, boustrophedon, or, bi, directional, text, was, also, used, in, ancient, greek, greek, has, occasionally, been, written, in, the, latin, script, especially, in, areas, under, venetian, rule, or, by, greek, catholics, the, term, frankolevantinika, applies, when, the, latin, script, is, used, to, write, greek, in, the, cultural, ambit, of, catholicism, because, frankos, is, an, older, greek, term, for, west, european, dating, to, when, most, of, roman, catholic, christian, west, europe, was, under, the, control, of, the, frankish, empire, frankochiotika, meaning, catholic, chiot, alludes, to, the, significant, presence, of, catholic, missionaries, based, on, the, island, of, chios, additionally, the, term, greeklish, is, often, used, when, the, greek, language, is, written, in, a, latin, script, in, online, communications, the, latin, script, is, nowadays, used, by, the, greek, speaking, communities, of, southern, italy, the, yevanic, dialect, was, written, by, romaniote, and, constantinopolitan, karaite, jews, using, the, hebrew, alphabet, some, greek, muslims, from, crete, wrote, their, cretan, greek, in, the, arabic, alphabet, the, same, happened, among, epirote, muslims, in, ioannina, this, usage, is, sometimes, called, aljamiado, as, when, romance, languages, are, written, in, the, arabic, alphabet, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, greek, transcription, of, the, example, text, into, latin, alphabet, article, 1, of, the,
