sign, languages, also, known, as, signed, languages, are, languages, that, use, the, visual, manual, modality, to, convey, meaning, instead, of, spoken, words, sign, languages, are, expressed, through, manual, articulation, in, combination, with, non, manual, markers, sign, languages, are, full, fledged, natural, languages, with, their, own, grammar, and, lexicon, sign, languages, are, not, universal, and, are, usually, not, mutually, intelligible, although, there, are, similarities, among, different, sign, languages, linguists, consider, both, spoken, and, signed, communication, to, be, types, of, natural, language, meaning, that, both, emerged, through, an, abstract, protracted, aging, process, and, evolved, over, time, without, meticulous, planning, this, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, there, is, substantial, overlap, between, the, neural, substrates, of, sign, and, spoken, language, processing, despite, the, obvious, differences, in, modality, sign, language, should, not, be, confused, with, body, language, a, type, of, nonverbal, communication, linguists, also, distinguish, natural, sign, languages, from, other, systems, that, are, precursors, to, them, or, obtained, from, them, such, as, constructed, manual, codes, for, spoken, languages, home, sign, baby, sign, and, signs, learned, by, non, human, primates, wherever, communities, of, deaf, people, exist, sign, languages, have, developed, as, useful, means, of, communication, and, form, the, core, of, local, deaf, cultures, although, signing, is, used, primarily, by, the, deaf, and, hard, of, hearing, it, is, also, used, by, hearing, individuals, such, as, those, unable, to, physically, speak, those, who, have, trouble, with, oral, language, due, to, a, disability, or, condition, augmentative, and, alternative, communication, and, those, with, deaf, family, members, including, children, of, deaf, adults, the, number, of, sign, languages, worldwide, is, not, precisely, known, each, country, generally, has, its, own, native, sign, language, some, have, more, than, one, the, 2021, edition, of, ethnologue, lists, 150, sign, languages, while, the, sign, hub, atlas, of, sign, language, structures, lists, over, 200, and, notes, that, there, are, more, that, have, not, been, documented, or, discovered, yet, as, of, 2021, indo, pakistani, sign, language, is, the, most, used, sign, language, in, the, world, and, ethnologue, ranks, it, as, the, 151st, most, spoken, language, in, the, world, some, sign, languages, have, obtained, some, form, of, legal, recognition, groups, of, deaf, people, have, used, sign, languages, throughout, history, one, of, the, earliest, written, records, of, a, sign, language, is, from, the, fifth, century, bc, in, plato, s, cratylus, where, socrates, says, if, we, hadn, t, a, voice, or, a, tongue, and, wanted, to, express, things, to, one, another, wouldn, t, we, try, to, make, signs, by, moving, our, hands, head, and, the, rest, of, our, body, just, as, dumb, people, do, at, present, most, of, what, is, known, about, pre, 19th, century, sign, languages, is, limited, to, the, manual, alphabets, fingerspelling, systems, that, were, invented, to, facilitate, the, transfer, of, words, from, a, spoken, language, to, a, sign, language, rather, than, documentation, of, the, language, itself, debate, around, european, monastic, sign, languages, developed, in, the, middle, ages, has, come, to, regard, them, as, gestural, systems, rather, than, true, sign, languages, monastic, sign, languages, were, the, basis, for, the, first, known, manual, alphabet, used, in, deaf, schools, developed, by, pedro, ponce, de, le, n, the, earliest, records, of, contact, between, europeans, and, indigenous, peoples, of, the, gulf, coast, region, in, what, is, now, texas, and, northern, mexico, note, a, fully, formed, sign, language, already, in, use, by, the, time, of, the, europeans, arrival, there, these, records, include, the, accounts, of, cabeza, de, vaca, in, 1527, and, coronado, in, 1541, in, 1620, juan, pablo, bonet, published, reducci, n, de, las, letras, y, arte, para, ense, ar, a, hablar, a, los, mudos, reduction, of, letters, and, art, for, teaching, mute, people, to, speak, in, madrid, it, is, considered, the, first, modern, treatise, of, sign, language, phonetics, setting, out, a, method, of, oral, education, for, deaf, people, and, a, manual, alphabet, in, britain, manual, alphabets, were, also, in, use, for, a, number, of, purposes, such, as, secret, communication, public, speaking, or, communication, by, or, with, deaf, people, in, 1648, john, bulwer, described, master, babington, a, deaf, man, proficient, in, the, use, of, a, manual, alphabet, contryved, on, the, joynts, of, his, fingers, whose, wife, could, converse, with, him, easily, even, in, the, dark, through, the, use, of, tactile, signing, in, 1680, george, dalgarno, published, didascalocophus, or, the, deaf, and, dumb, mans, tutor, in, which, he, presented, his, own, method, of, deaf, education, including, an, arthrological, alphabet, where, letters, are, indicated, by, pointing, to, different, joints, of, the, fingers, and, palm, of, the, left, hand, arthrological, systems, had, been, in, use, by, hearing, people, for, some, time, some, have, speculated, that, they, can, be, traced, to, early, ogham, manual, alphabets, the, vowels, of, this, alphabet, have, survived, in, the, modern, alphabets, used, in, british, sign, language, auslan, and, new, zealand, sign, language, the, earliest, known, printed, pictures, of, consonants, of, the, modern, two, handed, alphabet, appeared, in, 1698, with, digiti, lingua, latin, for, language, of, the, finger, a, pamphlet, by, an, anonymous, author, who, was, himself, unable, to, speak, he, suggested, that, the, manual, alphabet, could, also, be, used, by, mutes, for, silence, and, secrecy, or, purely, for, entertainment, nine, of, its, letters, can, be, traced, to, earlier, alphabets, and, 17, letters, of, the, modern, two, handed, alphabet, can, be, found, among, the, two, sets, of, 26, handshapes, depicted, charles, de, la, fin, published, a, book, in, 1692, describing, an, alphabetic, system, where, pointing, to, a, body, part, represented, the, first, letter, of, the, part, e, g, brow, b, and, vowels, were, located, on, the, fingertips, as, with, the, other, british, systems, he, described, such, codes, for, both, english, and, latin, by, 1720, the, british, manual, alphabet, had, found, more, or, less, its, present, form, descendants, of, this, alphabet, have, been, used, by, deaf, communities, at, least, in, education, in, the, former, british, colonies, india, australia, new, zealand, uganda, and, south, africa, as, well, as, the, republics, and, provinces, of, the, former, yugoslavia, grand, cayman, island, in, the, caribbean, indonesia, norway, germany, and, the, united, states, during, the, polygar, wars, against, the, british, veeran, sundaralingam, communicated, with, veerapandiya, kattabomman, s, mute, younger, brother, oomaithurai, by, using, their, own, sign, language, frenchman, charles, michel, de, l, p, e, published, his, manual, alphabet, in, the, 18th, century, which, has, survived, largely, unchanged, in, france, and, north, america, until, the, present, time, in, 1755, abb, de, l, p, e, founded, the, first, school, for, deaf, children, in, paris, laurent, clerc, was, arguably, its, most, famous, graduate, clerc, went, to, the, united, states, with, thomas, hopkins, gallaudet, to, found, the, american, school, for, the, deaf, in, hartford, connecticut, in, 1817, gallaudet, s, son, edward, miner, gallaudet, founded, a, school, for, the, deaf, in, 1857, in, washington, d, c, which, in, 1864, became, the, national, deaf, mute, college, now, called, gallaudet, university, it, is, still, the, only, liberal, arts, university, for, deaf, people, in, the, world, international, sign, formerly, known, as, gestuno, is, used, mainly, at, international, deaf, events, such, as, the, deaflympics, and, meetings, of, the, world, federation, of, the, deaf, while, recent, studies, claim, that, international, sign, is, a, kind, of, a, pidgin, they, conclude, that, it, is, more, complex, than, a, typical, pidgin, and, indeed, is, more, like, a, full, sign, language, while, the, more, commonly, used, term, is, international, sign, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, gestuno, international, sign, pidgin, or, international, gesture, ig, international, sign, is, a, term, used, by, the, world, federation, of, the, deaf, and, other, international, organisations, sign, languages, have, capability, and, complexity, equal, to, spoken, languages, their, study, as, part, of, the, field, of, linguistics, has, demonstrated, that, they, exhibit, the, fundamental, properties, that, exist, in, all, languages, such, fundamental, properties, include, duality, of, patterning, and, recursion, duality, of, patterning, means, that, languages, are, composed, of, smaller, meaningless, units, which, can, be, combined, into, larger, units, with, meaning, see, below, the, term, recursion, means, that, languages, exhibit, grammatical, rules, and, the, output, of, such, a, rule, can, be, the, input, of, the, same, rule, it, is, for, example, possible, in, sign, languages, to, create, subordinate, clauses, and, a, subordinate, clause, may, contain, another, subordinate, clause, sign, languages, are, not, mime, in, other, words, signs, are, conventional, often, arbitrary, and, do, not, necessarily, have, a, visual, relationship, to, their, referent, much, as, most, spoken, language, is, not, onomatopoeic, while, iconicity, is, more, systematic, and, widespread, in, sign, languages, than, in, spoken, ones, the, difference, is, not, categorical, the, visual, modality, allows, the, human, preference, for, close, connections, between, form, and, meaning, present, but, suppressed, in, spoken, languages, to, be, more, fully, expressed, sign, languages, like, spoken, languages, organize, elementary, meaningless, units, into, meaningful, semantic, units, this, type, of, organization, in, natural, language, is, often, called, duality, of, patterning, as, in, spoken, languages, these, meaningless, units, are, represented, as, combinations, of, features, although, coarser, descriptions, are, often, also, made, in, terms, of, five, parameters, handshape, or, handform, orientation, location, or, place, of, articulation, movement, and, non, manual, expression, these, meaningless, units, in, sign, languages, were, initially, called, cheremes, from, the, greek, word, for, hand, by, analogy, to, the, phonemes, from, greek, for, voice, of, spoken, languages, now, they, are, sometimes, called, phonemes, when, describing, sign, languages, too, since, the, function, is, the, same, but, more, commonly, discussed, in, terms, of, features, or, parameters, more, generally, both, sign, and, spoken, languages, share, the, characteristics, that, linguists, have, found, in, all, natural, human, languages, such, as, transitoriness, semanticity, arbitrariness, productivity, and, cultural, transmission, common, linguistic, features, of, many, sign, languages, are, the, occurrence, of, classifier, constructions, a, high, degree, of, inflection, by, means, of, changes, of, movement, and, a, topic, comment, syntax, more, than, spoken, languages, sign, languages, can, convey, meaning, by, simultaneous, means, e, g, by, the, use, of, space, two, manual, articulators, and, the, signer, s, face, and, body, though, there, is, still, much, discussion, on, the, topic, of, iconicity, in, sign, languages, classifiers, are, generally, considered, to, be, highly, iconic, as, these, complex, constructions, function, as, predicates, that, may, express, any, or, all, of, the, following, motion, position, stative, descriptive, or, handling, information, it, needs, to, be, noted, that, the, term, classifier, is, not, used, by, everyone, working, on, these, constructions, across, the, field, of, sign, language, linguistics, the, same, constructions, are, also, referred, with, other, terms, such, as, depictive, signs, today, linguists, study, sign, languages, as, true, languages, part, of, the, field, of, linguistics, however, the, category, sign, languages, was, not, added, to, the, linguistic, bibliography, bibliographie, linguistique, until, the, 1988, volume, when, it, appeared, with, 39, entries, there, is, a, common, misconception, that, sign, languages, are, spoken, language, expressed, in, signs, or, that, they, were, invented, by, hearing, people, similarities, in, language, processing, in, the, brain, between, signed, and, spoken, languages, further, perpetuated, this, misconception, hearing, teachers, in, deaf, schools, such, as, charles, michel, de, l, p, e, or, thomas, hopkins, gallaudet, are, often, incorrectly, referred, to, as, inventors, of, sign, language, instead, sign, languages, like, all, natural, languages, are, developed, by, the, people, who, use, them, in, this, case, deaf, people, who, may, have, little, or, no, knowledge, of, any, spoken, language, as, a, sign, language, develops, it, sometimes, borrows, elements, from, spoken, languages, just, as, all, languages, borrow, from, other, languages, that, they, are, in, contact, with, sign, languages, vary, in, how, much, they, borrow, from, spoken, languages, in, many, sign, languages, a, manual, alphabet, fingerspelling, may, be, used, in, signed, communication, to, borrow, a, word, from, a, spoken, language, this, is, most, commonly, used, for, proper, names, of, people, and, places, it, is, also, used, in, some, languages, for, concepts, for, which, no, sign, is, available, at, that, moment, particularly, if, the, people, involved, are, to, some, extent, bilingual, in, the, spoken, language, fingerspelling, can, sometimes, be, a, source, of, new, signs, such, as, initialized, signs, in, which, the, handshape, represents, the, first, letter, of, a, spoken, word, with, the, same, meaning, on, the, whole, though, sign, languages, are, independent, of, spoken, languages, and, follow, their, own, paths, of, development, for, example, british, sign, language, bsl, and, american, sign, language, asl, are, quite, different, and, mutually, unintelligible, even, though, the, hearing, people, of, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, share, the, same, spoken, language, the, grammars, of, sign, languages, do, not, usually, resemble, those, of, spoken, languages, used, in, the, same, geographical, area, in, fact, in, terms, of, syntax, asl, shares, more, with, spoken, japanese, than, it, does, with, english, similarly, countries, which, use, a, single, spoken, language, throughout, may, have, two, or, more, sign, languages, or, an, area, that, contains, more, than, one, spoken, language, might, use, only, one, sign, language, south, africa, which, has, 11, official, spoken, languages, and, a, similar, number, of, other, widely, used, spoken, languages, is, a, good, example, of, this, it, has, only, one, sign, language, with, two, variants, due, to, its, history, of, having, two, major, educational, institutions, for, the, deaf, which, have, served, different, geographic, areas, of, the, country, sign, languages, exploit, the, unique, features, of, the, visual, medium, sight, but, may, also, exploit, tactile, features, tactile, sign, languages, spoken, language, is, by, and, large, linear, only, one, sound, can, be, made, or, received, at, a, time, sign, language, on, the, other, hand, is, visual, and, hence, can, use, a, simultaneous, expression, although, this, is, limited, articulatorily, and, linguistically, visual, perception, allows, processing, of, simultaneous, information, one, way, in, which, many, sign, languages, take, advantage, of, the, spatial, nature, of, the, language, is, through, the, use, of, classifiers, classifiers, allow, a, signer, to, spatially, show, a, referent, s, type, size, shape, movement, or, extent, the, possible, simultaneity, of, sign, languages, in, contrast, to, spoken, languages, is, sometimes, exaggerated, the, use, of, two, manual, articulators, is, subject, to, motor, constraints, resulting, in, a, large, extent, of, symmetry, or, signing, with, one, articulator, only, further, sign, languages, just, like, spoken, languages, depend, on, linear, sequencing, of, signs, to, form, sentences, the, greater, use, of, simultaneity, is, mostly, seen, in, the, morphology, internal, structure, of, individual, signs, sign, languages, convey, much, of, their, prosody, through, non, manual, elements, postures, or, movements, of, the, body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and, mouth, are, used, in, various, combinations, to, show, several, categories, of, information, including, lexical, distinction, grammatical, structure, adjectival, or, adverbial, content, and, discourse, functions, at, the, lexical, level, signs, can, be, lexically, specified, for, non, manual, elements, in, addition, to, the, manual, articulation, for, instance, facial, expressions, may, accompany, verbs, of, emotion, as, in, the, sign, for, angry, in, czech, sign, language, non, manual, elements, may, also, be, lexically, contrastive, for, example, in, asl, american, sign, language, facial, components, distinguish, some, signs, from, other, signs, an, example, is, the, sign, translated, as, not, yet, which, requires, that, the, tongue, touch, the, lower, lip, and, that, the, head, rotate, from, side, to, side, in, addition, to, the, manual, part, of, the, sign, without, these, features, the, sign, would, be, interpreted, as, late, mouthings, which, are, parts, of, spoken, words, accompanying, lexical, signs, can, also, be, contrastive, as, in, the, manually, identical, signs, for, doctor, and, battery, in, sign, language, of, the, netherlands, while, the, content, of, a, signed, sentence, is, produced, manually, many, grammatical, functions, are, produced, non, manually, i, e, with, the, face, and, the, torso, such, functions, include, questions, negation, relative, clauses, and, topicalization, asl, and, bsl, use, similar, non, manual, marking, for, yes, no, questions, for, example, they, are, shown, through, raised, eyebrows, and, a, forward, head, tilt, some, adjectival, and, adverbial, information, is, conveyed, through, non, manual, elements, but, what, these, elements, are, varies, from, language, to, language, for, instance, in, asl, a, slightly, open, mouth, with, the, tongue, relaxed, and, visible, in, the, corner, of, the, mouth, means, carelessly, but, a, similar, non, manual, in, bsl, means, boring, or, unpleasant, discourse, functions, such, as, turn, taking, are, largely, regulated, through, head, movement, and, eye, gaze, since, the, addressee, in, a, signed, conversation, must, be, watching, the, signer, a, signer, can, avoid, letting, the, other, person, have, a, turn, by, not, looking, at, them, or, can, indicate, that, the, other, person, may, have, a, turn, by, making, eye, contact, iconicity, is, similarity, or, analogy, between, the, form, of, a, sign, linguistic, or, otherwise, and, its, meaning, as, opposed, to, arbitrariness, the, first, studies, on, iconicity, in, asl, were, published, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, many, early, sign, language, linguists, rejected, the, notion, that, iconicity, was, an, important, aspect, of, sign, languages, considering, most, perceived, iconicity, to, be, extralinguistic, however, mimetic, aspects, of, sign, language, signs, that, imitate, mimic, or, represent, are, found, in, abundance, across, a, wide, variety, of, sign, languages, for, example, when, deaf, children, learning, sign, language, try, to, express, something, but, do, not, know, the, associated, sign, they, will, often, invent, an, iconic, sign, that, displays, mimetic, properties, though, it, never, disappears, from, a, particular, sign, language, iconicity, is, gradually, weakened, as, forms, of, sign, languages, become, more, customary, and, are, subsequently, grammaticized, as, a, form, becomes, more, conventional, it, becomes, disseminated, in, a, methodical, way, phonologically, to, the, rest, of, the, sign, language, community, nancy, frishberg, concluded, that, though, originally, present, in, many, signs, iconicity, is, degraded, over, time, through, the, application, of, natural, grammatical, processes, in, 1978, psychologist, roger, brown, was, one, of, the, first, to, suggest, that, the, properties, of, asl, give, it, a, clear, advantage, in, terms, of, learning, and, memory, in, his, study, brown, found, that, when, a, group, of, six, hearing, children, were, taught, signs, that, had, high, levels, of, iconic, mapping, they, were, significantly, more, likely, to, recall, the, signs, in, a, later, memory, task, than, another, group, of, six, children, that, were, taught, signs, that, had, little, or, no, iconic, properties, in, contrast, to, brown, linguists, elissa, newport, and, richard, meier, found, that, iconicity, appears, to, have, virtually, no, impact, on, the, acquisition, of, american, sign, language, a, central, task, for, the, pioneers, of, sign, language, linguistics, was, trying, to, prove, that, asl, was, a, real, language, and, not, merely, a, collection, of, gestures, or, english, on, the, hands, one, of, the, prevailing, beliefs, at, this, time, was, that, real, languages, must, consist, of, an, arbitrary, relationship, between, form, and, meaning, thus, if, asl, consisted, of, signs, that, had, iconic, form, meaning, relationship, it, could, not, be, considered, a, real, language, as, a, result, iconicity, as, a, whole, was, largely, neglected, in, research, of, sign, languages, for, a, long, time, however, iconicity, also, plays, a, role, in, many, spoken, languages, spoken, japanese, for, example, exhibits, many, words, mimicking, the, sounds, of, their, potential, referents, see, japanese, sound, symbolism, later, researchers, thus, acknowledged, that, natural, languages, do, not, need, to, consist, of, an, arbitrary, relationship, between, form, and, meaning, the, visual, nature, of, sign, language, simply, allows, for, a, greater, degree, of, iconicity, compared, to, spoken, languages, as, most, real, world, objects, can, be, described, by, a, prototypical, shape, e, g, a, table, usually, has, a, flat, surface, but, most, real, world, objects, do, not, make, prototypical, sounds, that, can, be, mimicked, by, spoken, languages, e, g, tables, do, not, make, prototypical, sounds, it, has, to, be, noted, however, that, sign, languages, are, not, fully, iconic, on, the, one, hand, there, are, also, many, arbitrary, signs, in, sign, languages, and, on, the, other, hand, the, grammar, of, a, sign, language, puts, limits, to, the, degree, of, iconicity, all, known, sign, languages, for, example, express, lexical, concepts, via, manual, signs, from, a, truly, iconic, language, one, would, expect, that, a, concept, like, smiling, would, be, expressed, by, mimicking, a, smile, i, e, by, performing, a, smiling, face, all, known, sign, languages, however, do, not, express, the, concept, of, smiling, by, a, smiling, face, but, by, a, manual, sign, the, cognitive, linguistics, perspective, rejects, a, more, traditional, definition, of, iconicity, as, a, relationship, between, linguistic, form, and, a, concrete, real, world, referent, rather, it, is, a, set, of, selected, correspondences, between, the, form, and, meaning, of, a, sign, in, this, view, iconicity, is, grounded, in, a, language, user, s, mental, representation, construal, in, cognitive, grammar, it, is, defined, as, a, fully, grammatical, and, central, aspect, of, a, sign, language, rather, than, a, peripheral, phenomenon, the, cognitive, linguistics, perspective, allows, for, some, signs, to, be, fully, iconic, or, partially, iconic, given, the, number, of, correspondences, between, the, possible, parameters, of, form, and, meaning, in, this, way, the, israeli, sign, language, isl, sign, for, ask, has, parts, of, its, form, that, are, iconic, movement, away, from, the, mouth, means, something, coming, from, the, mouth, and, parts, that, are, arbitrary, the, handshape, and, the, orientation, many, signs, have, metaphoric, mappings, as, well, as, iconic, or, metonymic, ones, for, these, signs, there, are, three, way, correspondences, between, a, form, a, concrete, source, and, an, abstract, target, meaning, the, asl, sign, learn, has, this, three, way, correspondence, the, abstract, target, meaning, is, learning, the, concrete, source, is, putting, objects, into, the, head, from, books, the, form, is, a, grasping, hand, moving, from, an, open, palm, to, the, forehead, the, iconic, correspondence, is, between, form, and, concrete, source, the, metaphorical, correspondence, is, between, concrete, source, and, abstract, target, meaning, because, the, concrete, source, is, connected, to, two, correspondences, linguistics, refer, to, metaphorical, signs, as, double, mapped, sign, languages, may, be, classified, by, how, they, arise, in, non, signing, communities, home, sign, is, not, a, full, language, but, closer, to, a, pidgin, home, sign, is, amorphous, and, generally, idiosyncratic, to, a, particular, family, where, a, deaf, child, does, not, have, contact, with, other, deaf, children, and, is, not, educated, in, sign, such, systems, are, not, generally, passed, on, from, one, generation, to, the, next, where, they, are, passed, on, creolization, would, be, expected, to, occur, resulting, in, a, full, language, however, home, sign, may, also, be, closer, to, full, language, in, communities, where, the, hearing, population, has, a, gestural, mode, of, language, examples, include, various, australian, aboriginal, sign, languages, and, gestural, systems, across, west, africa, such, as, mofu, gudur, in, cameroon, a, village, sign, language, is, a, local, indigenous, language, that, typically, arises, over, several, generations, in, a, relatively, insular, community, with, a, high, incidence, of, deafness, and, is, used, both, by, the, deaf, and, by, a, significant, portion, of, the, hearing, community, who, have, deaf, family, and, friends, the, most, famous, of, these, is, probably, the, extinct, martha, s, vineyard, sign, language, of, the, u, s, but, there, are, also, numerous, village, languages, scattered, throughout, africa, asia, and, america, deaf, community, sign, languages, on, the, other, hand, arise, where, deaf, people, come, together, to, form, their, own, communities, these, include, school, sign, such, as, nicaraguan, sign, language, which, develop, in, the, student, bodies, of, deaf, schools, which, do, not, use, sign, as, a, language, of, instruction, as, well, as, community, languages, such, as, bamako, sign, language, which, arise, where, generally, uneducated, deaf, people, congregate, in, urban, centers, for, employment, at, first, deaf, community, sign, languages, are, not, generally, known, by, the, hearing, population, in, many, cases, not, even, by, close, family, members, however, they, may, grow, in, some, cases, becoming, a, language, of, instruction, and, receiving, official, recognition, as, in, the, case, of, asl, both, contrast, with, speech, taboo, languages, such, as, the, various, aboriginal, australian, sign, languages, which, are, developed, by, the, hearing, community, and, only, used, secondarily, by, the, deaf, it, is, doubtful, whether, most, of, these, are, languages, in, their, own, right, rather, than, manual, codes, of, spoken, languages, though, a, few, such, as, yolngu, sign, language, are, independent, of, any, particular, spoken, language, hearing, people, may, also, develop, sign, to, communicate, with, users, of, other, languages, as, in, plains, indian, sign, language, this, was, a, contact, signing, system, or, pidgin, that, was, evidently, not, used, by, deaf, people, in, the, plains, nations, though, it, presumably, influenced, home, sign, language, contact, and, creolization, is, common, in, the, development, of, sign, languages, making, clear, family, classifications, difficult, it, is, often, unclear, whether, lexical, similarity, is, due, to, borrowing, or, a, common, parent, language, or, whether, there, was, one, or, several, parent, languages, such, as, several, village, languages, merging, into, a, deaf, community, language, contact, occurs, between, sign, languages, between, sign, and, spoken, languages, contact, sign, a, kind, of, pidgin, and, between, sign, languages, and, gestural, systems, used, by, the, broader, community, for, example, adamorobe, sign, language, a, village, sign, language, of, ghana, may, be, related, to, the, gestural, trade, jargon, used, in, the, markets, throughout, west, africa, in, vocabulary, and, areal, features, including, prosody, and, phonetics, the, only, comprehensive, classification, along, these, lines, going, beyond, a, simple, listing, of, languages, dates, back, to, 1991, the, classification, is, based, on, the, 69, sign, languages, from, the, 1988, edition, of, ethnologue, that, were, known, at, the, time, of, the, 1989, conference, on, sign, languages, in, montreal, and, 11, more, languages, the, author, added, after, the, conference, 1, in, his, classification, the, author, distinguishes, between, primary, and, auxiliary, sign, languages, as, well, as, between, single, languages, and, names, that, are, thought, to, refer, to, more, than, one, language, the, prototype, a, class, of, languages, includes, all, those, sign, languages, that, seemingly, cannot, be, derived, from, any, other, language, prototype, r, languages, are, languages, that, are, remotely, modelled, on, a, prototype, a, language, in, many, cases, thought, to, have, been, french, sign, language, by, a, process, kroeber, 1940, called, stimulus, diffusion, the, families, of, bsl, dgs, jsl, lsf, and, possibly, lsg, were, the, products, of, creolization, and, relexification, of, prototype, languages, creolization, is, seen, as, enriching, overt, morphology, in, sign, languages, as, compared, to, reducing, overt, morphology, in, spoken, languages, linguistic, typology, going, back, to, edward, sapir, is, based, on, word, structure, and, distinguishes, morphological, classes, such, as, agglutinating, concatenating, inflectional, polysynthetic, incorporating, and, isolating, ones, sign, languages, vary, in, word, order, typology, for, example, austrian, sign, language, japanese, sign, language, and, indo, pakistani, sign, language, are, subject, object, verb, while, asl, is, subject, verb, object, influence, from, the, surrounding, spoken, languages, is, not, improbable, sign, languages, tend, to, be, incorporating, classifier, languages, where, a, classifier, handshape, representing, the, object, is, incorporated, into, those, transitive, verbs, which, allow, such, modification, for, a, similar, group, of, intransitive, verbs, especially, motion, verbs, it, is, the, subject, which, is, incorporated, only, in, a, very, few, sign, languages, for, instance, japanese, sign, language, are, agents, ever, incorporated, in, this, way, since, subjects, of, intransitives, are, treated, similarly, to, objects, of, transitives, incorporation, in, sign, languages, can, be, said, to, follow, an, ergative, pattern, brentari, classifies, sign, languages, as, a, whole, group, determined, by, the, medium, of, communication, visual, instead, of, auditory, as, one, group, with, the, features, monosyllabic, and, polymorphemic, that, means, that, one, syllable, i, e, one, word, one, sign, can, express, several, morphemes, e, g, subject, and, object, of, a, verb, determine, the, direction, of, the, verb, s, movement, inflection, another, aspect, of, typology, that, has, been, studied, in, sign, languages, is, their, systems, for, cardinal, numbers, typologically, significant, differences, have, been, found, between, sign, languages, children, who, are, exposed, to, a, sign, language, from, birth, will, acquire, it, just, as, hearing, children, acquire, their, native, spoken, language, in, a, study, done, at, the, university, of, mcgill, they, found, that, american, sign, language, users, who, acquired, the, language, natively, from, birth, performed, better, when, asked, to, copy, videos, of, asl, sentences, than, asl, users, who, acquired, the, language, later, in, life, they, also, found, that, there, are, differences, in, the, grammatical, morphology, of, asl, sentences, between, the, two, groups, all, suggesting, that, there, is, a, very, important, critical, period, in, learning, signed, languages, the, acquisition, of, non, manual, features, follows, an, interesting, pattern, when, a, word, that, always, has, a, particular, non, manual, feature, associated, with, it, such, as, a, wh, question, word, is, learned, the, non, manual, aspects, are, attached, to, the, word, but, do, not, have, the, flexibility, associated, with, adult, use, at, a, certain, point, the, non, manual, features, are, dropped, and, the, word, is, produced, with, no, facial, expression, after, a, few, months, the, non, manuals, reappear, this, time, being, used, the, way, adult, signers, would, use, them, sign, languages, do, not, have, a, traditional, or, formal, written, form, many, deaf, people, do, not, see, a, need, to, write, their, own, language, several, ways, to, represent, sign, languages, in, written, form, have, been, developed, so, far, there, is, no, consensus, regarding, the, written, form, of, sign, language, except, for, signwriting, none, are, widely, used, maria, galea, writes, that, signwriting, is, becoming, widespread, uncontainable, and, untraceable, in, the, same, way, that, works, written, in, and, about, a, well, developed, writing, system, such, as, the, latin, script, the, time, has, arrived, where, sw, is, so, widespread, that, it, is, impossible, in, the, same, way, to, list, all, works, that, have, been, produced, using, this, writing, system, and, that, have, been, written, about, this, writing, system, in, 2015, the, federal, university, of, santa, catarina, accepted, a, dissertation, written, in, brazilian, sign, language, using, sutton, signwriting, for, a, master, s, degree, in, linguistics, the, dissertation, the, writing, of, grammatical, non, manual, expressions, in, sentences, in, libras, using, the, signwriting, system, by, jo, o, paulo, ampessan, states, that, the, data, indicate, the, need, for, usage, in, writing, sign, language, for, a, native, signer, sign, perception, influences, how, the, mind, makes, sense, of, their, visual, language, experience, for, example, a, handshape, may, vary, based, on, the, other, signs, made, before, or, after, it, but, these, variations, are, arranged, in, perceptual, categories, during, its, development, the, mind, detects, handshape, contrasts, but, groups, similar, handshapes, together, in, one, category, different, handshapes, are, stored, in, other, categories, the, mind, ignores, some, of, the, similarities, between, different, perceptual, categories, at, the, same, time, preserving, the, visual, information, within, each, perceptual, category, of, handshape, variation, when, deaf, people, constitute, a, relatively, small, proportion, of, the, general, population, deaf, communities, often, develop, that, are, distinct, from, the, surrounding, hearing, community, these, deaf, communities, are, very, widespread, in, the, world, associated, especially, with, sign, languages, used, in, urban, areas, and, throughout, a, nation, and, the, cultures, they, have, developed, are, very, rich, one, example, of, sign, language, variation, in, the, deaf, community, is, black, asl, this, sign, language, was, developed, in, the, black, deaf, community, as, a, variant, during, the, american, era, of, segregation, and, racism, where, young, black, deaf, students, were, forced, to, attend, separate, schools, than, their, white, deaf, peers, on, occasion, where, the, prevalence, of, deaf, people, is, high, enough, a, deaf, sign, language, has, been, taken, up, by, an, entire, local, community, forming, what, is, sometimes, called, a, village, sign, language, or, shared, signing, community, typically, this, happens, in, small, tightly, integrated, communities, with, a, closed, gene, pool, famous, examples, include, in, such, communities, deaf, people, are, generally, well, integrated, in, the, general, community, and, not, socially, disadvantaged, so, much, so, that, it, is, difficult, to, speak, of, a, separate, deaf, community, many, australian, aboriginal, sign, languages, arose, in, a, context, of, extensive, speech, taboos, such, as, during, mourning, and, initiation, rites, they, are, or, were, especially, highly, developed, among, the, warlpiri, warumungu, dieri, kaytetye, arrernte, and, warlmanpa, and, are, based, on, their, respective, spoken, languages, a, sign, language, arose, among, tribes, of, american, indians, in, the, great, plains, region, of, north, america, see, plains, indian, sign, language, before, european, contact, it, was, used, by, hearing, people, to, communicate, among, tribes, with, different, spoken, languages, as, well, as, by, deaf, people, there, are, especially, users, today, among, the, crow, cheyenne, and, arapaho, sign, language, is, also, used, as, a, form, of, alternative, or, augmentative, communication, by, people, who, can, hear, but, have, difficulties, using, their, voices, to, speak, increasingly, hearing, schools, and, universities, are, expressing, interest, in, incorporating, sign, language, in, the, u, s, enrollment, for, asl, american, sign, language, classes, as, part, of, students, choice, of, second, language, is, on, the, rise, in, new, zealand, one, year, after, the, passing, of, nzsl, act, 2006, in, parliament, a, nzsl, curriculum, was, released, for, schools, to, take, nzsl, as, an, optional, subject, the, curriculum, and, teaching, materials, were, designed, to, target, intermediate, schools, from, years, 7, to, 10, nz, herald, 2007, some, sign, languages, have, obtained, some, form, of, legal, recognition, while, others, have, no, status, at, all, sarah, batterbury, has, argued, that, sign, languages, should, be, recognized, and, supported, not, merely, as, an, accommodation, for, those, with, disabilities, but, as, the, communication, medium, of, language, communities, legal, requirements, covering, sign, language, accessibility, in, media, vary, from, country, to, country, in, the, united, kingdom, the, broadcasting, act, 1996, addressed, the, requirements, for, blind, and, deaf, viewers, but, has, since, been, replaced, by, the, communications, act, 2003, in, order, to, facilitate, communication, between, deaf, and, hearing, people, sign, language, interpreters, are, often, used, such, activities, involve, considerable, effort, on, the, part, of, the, interpreter, since, sign, languages, are, distinct, natural, languages, with, their, own, syntax, different, from, any, spoken, language, the, interpretation, flow, is, normally, between, a, sign, language, and, a, spoken, language, that, are, customarily, used, in, the, same, country, such, as, french, sign, language, lsf, and, spoken, french, in, france, spanish, sign, language, lse, to, spoken, spanish, in, spain, british, sign, language, bsl, and, spoken, english, in, the, u, k, and, american, sign, language, asl, and, spoken, english, in, the, u, s, and, most, of, anglophone, canada, since, bsl, and, asl, are, distinct, sign, languages, both, used, in, english, speaking, countries, etc, sign, language, interpreters, who, can, translate, between, signed, and, spoken, languages, that, are, not, normally, paired, such, as, between, lse, and, english, are, also, available, albeit, less, frequently, sign, language, is, sometimes, provided, for, television, programmes, that, include, speech, the, signer, usually, appears, in, the, bottom, corner, of, the, screen, with, the, programme, being, broadcast, full, size, or, slightly, shrunk, away, from, that, corner, typically, for, press, conferences, such, as, those, given, by, the, mayor, of, new, york, city, the, signer, appears, to, stage, left, or, right, of, the, public, official, to, allow, both, the, speaker, and, signer, to, be, in, frame, at, the, same, time, live, sign, interpretation, of, important, televised, events, is, increasingly, common, but, still, an, informal, industry, in, traditional, analogue, broadcasting, some, programmes, are, repeated, outside, main, viewing, hours, with, a, signer, present, some, emerging, television, technologies, allow, the, viewer, to, turn, the, signer, on, and, off, in, a, similar, manner, to, subtitles, and, closed, captioning, one, of, the, first, demonstrations, of, the, ability, for, telecommunications, to, help, sign, language, users, communicate, with, each, other, occurred, when, at, t, s, videophone, trademarked, as, the, picturephone, was, introduced, to, the, public, at, the, 1964, new, york, world, s, fair, two, deaf, users, were, able, to, freely, communicate, with, each, other, between, the, fair, and, another, city, however, video, communication, did, not, become, widely, available, until, sufficient, bandwidth, for, the, high, volume, of, video, data, became, available, in, the, early, 2000s, the, internet, now, allows, deaf, people, to, talk, via, a, video, link, either, with, a, special, purpose, videophone, designed, for, use, with, sign, language, or, with, off, the, shelf, video, services, designed, for, use, with, broadband, and, an, ordinary, computer, webcam, the, special, videophones, that, are, designed, for, sign, language, communication, may, provide, better, quality, than, off, the, shelf, services, and, may, use, data, compression, methods, specifically, designed, to, maximize, the, intelligibility, of, sign, languages, some, advanced, equipment, enables, a, person, to, remotely, control, the, other, person, s, video, camera, in, order, to, zoom, in, and, out, or, to, point, the, camera, better, to, understand, the, signing, interpreters, may, be, physically, present, with, both, parties, to, the, conversation, but, since, the, technological, advancements, in, the, early, 2000s, provision, of, interpreters, in, remote, locations, has, become, available, in, video, remote, interpreting, vri, the, two, clients, a, sign, language, user, and, a, hearing, person, who, wish, to, communicate, with, each, other, are, in, one, location, and, the, interpreter, is, in, another, the, interpreter, communicates, with, the, sign, language, user, via, a, video, telecommunications, link, and, with, the, hearing, person, by, an, audio, link, vri, can, be, used, for, situations, in, which, no, on, site, interpreters, are, available, however, vri, cannot, be, used, for, situations, in, which, all, parties, are, speaking, via, telephone, alone, with, video, relay, service, vrs, the, sign, language, user, the, interpreter, and, the, hearing, person, are, in, three, separate, locations, thus, allowing, the, two, clients, to, talk, to, each, other, on, the, phone, through, the, interpreter, with, recent, developments, in, artificial, intelligence, in, computer, science, some, recent, deep, learning, based, machine, translation, algorithms, have, been, developed, which, automatically, translate, short, videos, containing, sign, language, directly, to, written, language, sign, language, has, been, incorporated, into, film, for, example, all, movies, shown, in, brazilian, movie, theaters, must, have, a, brazilian, sign, language, video, track, available, to, play, alongside, the, film, via, a, second, screen, the, sign, union, flag, was, designed, by, arnaud, balard, after, studying, flags, around, the, world, and, vexillology, principles, for, two, years, balard, revealed, the, design, of, the, flag, featuring, the, stylized, outline, of, a, hand, the, three, colors, which, make, up, the, flag, design, are, representative, of, deafhood, and, humanity, dark, blue, sign, language, turquoise, and, enlightenment, and, hope, yellow, balard, intended, the, flag, to, be, an, international, symbol, which, welcomes, deaf, people, as, with, any, spoken, language, sign, languages, are, also, vulnerable, to, becoming, endangered, for, example, a, sign, language, used, by, a, small, community, may, be, endangered, and, even, abandoned, as, users, shift, to, a, sign, language, used, by, a, larger, community, as, has, happened, with, hawai, i, sign, language, which, is, almost, extinct, except, for, a, few, elderly, signers, even, nationally, recognised, sign, languages, can, be, endangered, for, example, new, zealand, sign, language, is, losing, users, methods, are, being, developed, to, assess, the, language, vitality, of, sign, languages, there, are, a, number, of, communication, systems, that, are, similar, in, some, respects, to, sign, languages, while, not, having, all, the, characteristics, of, a, full, sign, language, particularly, its, grammatical, structure, many, of, these, are, either, precursors, to, natural, sign, languages, or, are, derived, from, them, when, deaf, and, hearing, people, interact, signing, systems, may, be, developed, that, use, signs, drawn, from, a, natural, sign, language, but, used, according, to, the, grammar, of, the, spoken, language, in, particular, when, people, devise, one, for, one, sign, for, word, correspondences, between, spoken, words, or, even, morphemes, and, signs, that, represent, them, the, system, that, results, is, a, manual, code, for, a, spoken, language, rather, than, a, natural, sign, language, such, systems, may, be, invented, in, an, attempt, to, help, teach, deaf, children, the, spoken, language, and, generally, are, not, used, outside, an, educational, context, some, hearing, parents, teach, signs, to, young, hearing, children, since, the, muscles, in, babies, hands, grow, and, develop, quicker, than, their, mouths, signs, are, seen, as, a, beneficial, option, for, better, communication, babies, can, usually, produce, signs, before, they, can, speak, this, reduces, the, confusion, between, parents, when, trying, to, figure, out, what, their, child, wants, when, the, child, begins, to, speak, signing, is, usually, abandoned, so, the, child, does, not, progress, to, acquiring, the, grammar, of, the, sign, language, this, is, in, contrast, to, hearing, children, who, grow, up, with, deaf, parents, who, generally, acquire, the, full, sign, language, natively, the, same, as, deaf, children, of, deaf, parents, informal, rudimentary, sign, systems, are, sometimes, developed, within, a, single, family, for, instance, when, hearing, parents, with, no, sign, language, skills, have, a, deaf, child, the, child, may, develop, a, system, of, signs, naturally, unless, repressed, by, the, parents, the, term, for, these, mini, languages, is, home, sign, sometimes, kitchen, sign, home, sign, arises, due, to, the, absence, of, any, other, way, to, communicate, within, the, span, of, a, single, lifetime, and, without, the, support, or, feedback, of, a, community, the, child, naturally, invents, signs, to, help, meet, his, or, her, communication, needs, and, may, even, develop, a, few, grammatical, rules, for, combining, short, sequences, of, signs, still, this, kind, of, system, is, inadequate, for, the, intellectual, development, of, a, child, and, it, comes, nowhere, near, meeting, the, standards, linguists, use, to, describe, a, complete, language, no, type, of, home, sign, is, recognized, as, a, full, language, there, have, been, several, notable, examples, of, scientists, teaching, signs, to, non, human, primates, in, order, to, communicate, with, humans, such, as, chimpanzees, gorillas, and, orangutans, however, linguists, generally, point, out, that, this, does, not, constitute, knowledge, of, a, human, language, as, a, complete, system, rather, than, simply, signs, words, notable, examples, of, animals, who, have, learned, signs, include, one, theory, of, the, evolution, of, human, language, states, that, it, developed, first, as, a, gestural, system, which, later, shifted, to, speech, an, important, question, for, this, gestural, theory, is, what, caused, the, shift, to, vocalization, note, the, articles, for, specific, sign, languages, e, g, asl, or, bsl, may, contain, further, external, links, e, g, for, learning, those, languages, b, denotes, the, number, if, known, of, languages, within, the, family, no, further, information, is, given, on, these, languages
