an, ethnicity, or, ethnic, group, is, a, group, of, people, who, identify, with, each, other, on, the, basis, of, perceived, shared, attributes, that, distinguish, them, from, other, groups, those, attributes, can, include, a, people, of, a, common, language, culture, common, sets, of, ancestry, traditions, society, religion, history, or, social, treatment, the, term, ethnicity, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, the, term, nation, particularly, in, cases, of, ethnic, nationalism, ethnicity, may, be, construed, as, an, inherited, or, societally, imposed, construct, ethnic, membership, tends, to, be, defined, by, a, shared, cultural, heritage, ancestry, origin, myth, history, homeland, language, dialect, religion, mythology, folklore, ritual, cuisine, dressing, style, art, or, physical, appearance, ethnic, groups, may, share, a, narrow, or, broad, spectrum, of, genetic, ancestry, depending, on, group, identification, with, some, groups, having, mixed, genetic, ancestry, by, way, of, language, shift, intermarriage, acculturation, adoption, and, religious, conversion, individuals, or, groups, may, over, time, shift, from, one, ethnic, group, to, another, ethnic, groups, may, be, divided, into, subgroups, or, tribes, which, over, time, may, become, separate, ethnic, groups, themselves, due, to, endogamy, or, physical, isolation, from, the, parent, group, conversely, formerly, separate, ethnicities, can, merge, to, form, a, pan, ethnicity, and, may, eventually, merge, into, one, single, ethnicity, whether, through, division, or, amalgamation, the, formation, of, a, separate, ethnic, identity, is, referred, to, as, ethnogenesis, although, both, organic, and, performative, criteria, characterise, ethnic, groups, debate, in, the, past, has, dichotomised, between, primordialism, and, constructivism, earlier, 20th, century, primordialists, viewed, ethnic, groups, as, real, phenomena, whose, distinct, characteristics, have, endured, since, the, distant, past, perspectives, that, developed, after, the, 1960s, increasingly, viewed, ethnic, groups, as, social, constructs, with, identity, assigned, by, societal, rules, the, term, ethnic, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, ethnos, more, precisely, from, the, adjective, ethnikos, which, was, loaned, into, latin, as, ethnicus, the, inherited, english, language, term, for, this, concept, is, folk, used, alongside, the, latinate, people, since, the, late, middle, english, period, in, early, modern, english, and, until, the, mid, 19th, century, ethnic, was, used, to, mean, heathen, or, pagan, in, the, sense, of, disparate, nations, which, did, not, yet, participate, in, the, christian, oikumene, as, the, septuagint, used, ta, ethne, the, nations, to, translate, the, hebrew, goyim, the, foreign, nations, non, hebrews, non, jews, the, greek, term, in, early, antiquity, homeric, greek, could, refer, to, any, large, group, a, host, of, men, a, band, of, comrades, as, well, as, a, swarm, or, flock, of, animals, in, classical, greek, the, term, took, on, a, meaning, comparable, to, the, concept, now, expressed, by, ethnic, group, mostly, translated, as, nation, tribe, a, unique, people, group, only, in, hellenistic, greek, did, the, term, tend, to, become, further, narrowed, to, refer, to, foreign, or, barbarous, nations, in, particular, whence, the, later, meaning, heathen, pagan, in, the, 19th, century, the, term, came, to, be, used, in, the, sense, of, peculiar, to, a, tribe, race, people, or, nation, in, a, return, to, the, original, greek, meaning, the, sense, of, different, cultural, groups, and, in, american, english, tribal, racial, cultural, or, national, minority, group, arises, in, the, 1930s, to, 1940s, serving, as, a, replacement, of, the, term, race, which, had, earlier, taken, this, sense, but, was, now, becoming, deprecated, due, to, its, association, with, ideological, racism, the, abstract, ethnicity, had, been, used, as, a, stand, in, for, paganism, in, the, 18th, century, but, now, came, to, express, the, meaning, of, an, ethnic, character, first, recorded, 1953, the, term, ethnic, group, was, first, recorded, in, 1935, and, entered, the, oxford, english, dictionary, in, 1972, depending, on, context, the, term, nationality, may, be, used, either, synonymously, with, ethnicity, or, synonymously, with, citizenship, in, a, sovereign, state, the, process, that, results, in, emergence, of, an, ethnicity, is, called, ethnogenesis, a, term, in, use, in, ethnological, literature, since, about, 1950, the, term, may, also, be, used, with, the, connotation, of, something, unique, and, unusually, exotic, cf, an, ethnic, restaurant, etc, generally, related, to, cultures, of, more, recent, immigrants, who, arrived, after, the, dominant, population, of, an, area, was, established, depending, on, which, source, of, group, identity, is, emphasized, to, define, membership, the, following, types, of, often, mutually, overlapping, groups, can, be, identified, in, many, cases, more, than, one, aspect, determines, membership, for, instance, armenian, ethnicity, can, be, defined, by, armenian, citizenship, having, armenian, heritage, native, use, of, the, armenian, language, or, membership, of, the, armenian, apostolic, church, ethnography, begins, in, classical, antiquity, after, early, authors, like, anaximander, and, hecataeus, of, miletus, herodotus, laid, the, foundation, of, both, historiography, and, ethnography, of, the, ancient, world, c, 480, bc, the, greeks, had, developed, a, concept, of, their, own, ethnicity, which, they, grouped, under, the, name, of, hellenes, herodotus, 8, 144, 2, gave, a, famous, account, of, what, defined, greek, hellenic, ethnic, identity, in, his, day, enumerating, whether, ethnicity, qualifies, as, a, cultural, universal, is, to, some, extent, dependent, on, the, exact, definition, used, many, social, scientists, such, as, anthropologists, fredrik, barth, and, eric, wolf, do, not, consider, ethnic, identity, to, be, universal, they, regard, ethnicity, as, a, product, of, specific, kinds, of, inter, group, interactions, rather, than, an, essential, quality, inherent, to, human, groups, according, to, thomas, hylland, eriksen, the, study, of, ethnicity, was, dominated, by, two, distinct, debates, until, recently, according, to, eriksen, these, debates, have, been, superseded, especially, in, anthropology, by, scholars, attempts, to, respond, to, increasingly, politicized, forms, of, self, representation, by, members, of, different, ethnic, groups, and, nations, this, is, in, the, context, of, debates, over, multiculturalism, in, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, canada, which, have, large, immigrant, populations, from, many, different, cultures, and, post, colonialism, in, the, caribbean, and, south, asia, max, weber, maintained, that, ethnic, groups, were, k, nstlich, artificial, i, e, a, social, construct, because, they, were, based, on, a, subjective, belief, in, shared, gemeinschaft, community, secondly, this, belief, in, shared, gemeinschaft, did, not, create, the, group, the, group, created, the, belief, third, group, formation, resulted, from, the, drive, to, monopolize, power, and, status, this, was, contrary, to, the, prevailing, naturalist, belief, of, the, time, which, held, that, socio, cultural, and, behavioral, differences, between, peoples, stemmed, from, inherited, traits, and, tendencies, derived, from, common, descent, then, called, race, another, influential, theoretician, of, ethnicity, was, fredrik, barth, whose, ethnic, groups, and, boundaries, from, 1969, has, been, described, as, instrumental, in, spreading, the, usage, of, the, term, in, social, studies, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, barth, went, further, than, weber, in, stressing, the, constructed, nature, of, ethnicity, to, barth, ethnicity, was, perpetually, negotiated, and, renegotiated, by, both, external, ascription, and, internal, self, identification, barth, s, view, is, that, ethnic, groups, are, not, discontinuous, cultural, isolates, or, logical, a, priori, to, which, people, naturally, belong, he, wanted, to, part, with, anthropological, notions, of, cultures, as, bounded, entities, and, ethnicity, as, primordialist, bonds, replacing, it, with, a, focus, on, the, interface, between, groups, ethnic, groups, and, boundaries, therefore, is, a, focus, on, the, interconnectedness, of, ethnic, identities, barth, writes, categorical, ethnic, distinctions, do, not, depend, on, an, absence, of, mobility, contact, and, information, but, do, entail, social, processes, of, exclusion, and, incorporation, whereby, discrete, categories, are, maintained, despite, changing, participation, and, membership, in, the, course, of, individual, life, histories, in, 1978, anthropologist, ronald, cohen, claimed, that, the, identification, of, ethnic, groups, in, the, usage, of, social, scientists, often, reflected, inaccurate, labels, more, than, indigenous, realities, the, named, ethnic, identities, we, accept, often, unthinkingly, as, basic, givens, in, the, literature, are, often, arbitrarily, or, even, worse, inaccurately, imposed, in, this, way, he, pointed, to, the, fact, that, identification, of, an, ethnic, group, by, outsiders, e, g, anthropologists, may, not, coincide, with, the, self, identification, of, the, members, of, that, group, he, also, described, that, in, the, first, decades, of, usage, the, term, ethnicity, had, often, been, used, in, lieu, of, older, terms, such, as, cultural, or, tribal, when, referring, to, smaller, groups, with, shared, cultural, systems, and, shared, heritage, but, that, ethnicity, had, the, added, value, of, being, able, to, describe, the, commonalities, between, systems, of, group, identity, in, both, tribal, and, modern, societies, cohen, also, suggested, that, claims, concerning, ethnic, identity, like, earlier, claims, concerning, tribal, identity, are, often, colonialist, practices, and, effects, of, the, relations, between, colonized, peoples, and, nation, states, according, to, paul, james, formations, of, identity, were, often, changed, and, distorted, by, colonization, but, identities, are, not, made, out, of, nothing, categorizations, about, identity, even, when, codified, and, hardened, into, clear, typologies, by, processes, of, colonization, state, formation, or, general, modernizing, processes, are, always, full, of, tensions, and, contradictions, sometimes, these, contradictions, are, destructive, but, they, can, also, be, creative, and, positive, social, scientists, have, thus, focused, on, how, when, and, why, different, markers, of, ethnic, identity, become, salient, thus, anthropologist, joan, vincent, observed, that, ethnic, boundaries, often, have, a, mercurial, character, ronald, cohen, concluded, that, ethnicity, is, a, series, of, nesting, dichotomizations, of, inclusiveness, and, exclusiveness, he, agrees, with, joan, vincent, s, observation, that, in, cohen, s, paraphrase, ethnicity, can, be, narrowed, or, broadened, in, boundary, terms, in, relation, to, the, specific, needs, of, political, mobilization, this, may, be, why, descent, is, sometimes, a, marker, of, ethnicity, and, sometimes, not, which, diacritic, of, ethnicity, is, salient, depends, on, whether, people, are, scaling, ethnic, boundaries, up, or, down, and, whether, they, are, scaling, them, up, or, down, depends, generally, on, the, political, situation, kanchan, chandra, rejects, the, expansive, definitions, of, ethnic, identity, such, as, those, that, include, common, culture, common, language, common, history, and, common, territory, choosing, instead, to, define, ethnic, identity, narrowly, as, a, subset, of, identity, categories, determined, by, the, belief, of, common, descent, j, hanna, birnir, similarly, defines, ethnicity, as, group, self, identification, around, a, characteristic, that, is, very, difficult, or, even, impossible, to, change, such, as, language, race, or, location, different, approaches, to, understanding, ethnicity, have, been, used, by, different, social, scientists, when, trying, to, understand, the, nature, of, ethnicity, as, a, factor, in, human, life, and, society, as, jonathan, m, hall, observes, world, war, ii, was, a, turning, point, in, ethnic, studies, the, consequences, of, nazi, racism, discouraged, essentialist, interpretations, of, ethnic, groups, and, race, ethnic, groups, came, to, be, defined, as, social, rather, than, biological, entities, their, coherence, was, attributed, to, shared, myths, descent, kinship, a, common, place, of, origin, language, religion, customs, and, national, character, so, ethnic, groups, are, conceived, as, mutable, rather, than, stable, constructed, in, discursive, practices, rather, than, written, in, the, genes, examples, of, various, approaches, are, primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism, and, instrumentalism, ethnicity, is, an, important, means, by, which, people, may, identify, with, a, larger, group, many, social, scientists, such, as, anthropologists, fredrik, barth, and, eric, wolf, do, not, consider, ethnic, identity, to, be, universal, they, regard, ethnicity, as, a, product, of, specific, kinds, of, inter, group, interactions, rather, than, an, essential, quality, inherent, to, human, groups, the, process, that, results, in, emergence, of, such, identification, is, called, ethnogenesis, members, of, an, ethnic, group, on, the, whole, claim, cultural, continuities, over, time, although, historians, and, cultural, anthropologists, have, documented, that, many, of, the, values, practices, and, norms, that, imply, continuity, with, the, past, are, of, relatively, recent, invention, ethnic, groups, can, form, a, cultural, mosaic, in, a, society, that, could, be, in, a, city, like, new, york, city, or, trieste, but, also, the, fallen, monarchy, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, or, the, united, states, current, topics, are, in, particular, social, and, cultural, differentiation, multilingualism, competing, identity, offers, multiple, cultural, identities, and, the, formation, of, salad, bowl, and, melting, pot, ethnic, groups, differ, from, other, social, groups, such, as, subcultures, interest, groups, or, social, classes, because, they, emerge, and, change, over, historical, periods, centuries, in, a, process, known, as, ethnogenesis, a, period, of, several, generations, of, endogamy, resulting, in, common, ancestry, which, is, then, sometimes, cast, in, terms, of, a, mythological, narrative, of, a, founding, figure, ethnic, identity, is, reinforced, by, reference, to, boundary, markers, characteristics, said, to, be, unique, to, the, group, which, set, it, apart, from, other, groups, ethnicity, theory, argues, that, race, is, a, social, category, and, is, only, one, of, several, factors, in, determining, ethnicity, other, criteria, include, religion, language, customs, nationality, and, political, identification, this, theory, was, put, forward, by, sociologist, robert, e, park, in, the, 1920s, it, is, based, on, the, notion, of, culture, this, theory, was, preceded, by, more, than, 100, years, during, which, biological, essentialism, was, the, dominant, paradigm, on, race, biological, essentialism, is, the, belief, that, some, races, specifically, white, europeans, in, western, versions, of, the, paradigm, are, biologically, superior, and, other, races, specifically, non, white, races, in, western, debates, are, inherently, inferior, this, view, arose, as, a, way, to, justify, enslavement, of, african, americans, and, genocide, of, native, americans, in, a, society, that, was, officially, founded, on, freedom, for, all, this, was, a, notion, that, developed, slowly, and, came, to, be, a, preoccupation, with, scientists, theologians, and, the, public, religious, institutions, asked, questions, about, whether, there, had, been, multiple, creations, of, races, polygenesis, and, whether, god, had, created, lesser, races, many, of, the, foremost, scientists, of, the, time, took, up, the, idea, of, racial, difference, and, found, that, white, europeans, were, superior, the, ethnicity, theory, was, based, on, the, assimilation, model, park, outlined, four, steps, to, assimilation, contact, conflict, accommodation, and, assimilation, instead, of, attributing, the, marginalized, status, of, people, of, color, in, the, united, states, to, their, inherent, biological, inferiority, he, attributed, it, to, their, failure, to, assimilate, into, american, culture, they, could, become, equal, if, they, abandoned, their, inferior, cultures, michael, omi, and, howard, winant, s, theory, of, racial, formation, directly, confronts, both, the, premises, and, the, practices, of, ethnicity, theory, they, argue, in, racial, formation, in, the, united, states, that, the, ethnicity, theory, was, exclusively, based, on, the, immigration, patterns, of, the, white, population, and, did, take, into, account, the, unique, experiences, of, non, whites, in, the, united, states, while, park, s, theory, identified, different, stages, in, the, immigration, process, contact, conflict, struggle, and, as, the, last, and, best, response, assimilation, it, did, so, only, for, white, communities, the, ethnicity, paradigm, neglected, the, ways, in, which, race, can, complicate, a, community, s, interactions, with, social, and, political, structures, especially, upon, contact, assimilation, shedding, the, particular, qualities, of, a, native, culture, for, the, purpose, of, blending, in, with, a, host, culture, did, not, work, for, some, groups, as, a, response, to, racism, and, discrimination, though, it, did, for, others, once, the, legal, barriers, to, achieving, equality, had, been, dismantled, the, problem, of, racism, became, the, sole, responsibility, of, already, disadvantaged, communities, it, was, assumed, that, if, a, black, or, latino, community, was, not, making, it, by, the, standards, that, had, been, set, by, whites, it, was, because, that, community, did, not, hold, the, right, values, or, beliefs, or, were, stubbornly, resisting, dominant, norms, because, they, did, not, want, to, fit, in, omi, and, winant, s, critique, of, ethnicity, theory, explains, how, looking, to, cultural, defect, as, the, source, of, inequality, ignores, the, concrete, sociopolitical, dynamics, within, which, racial, phenomena, operate, in, the, u, s, it, prevents, critical, examination, of, the, structural, components, of, racism, and, encourages, a, benign, neglect, of, social, inequality, in, some, cases, especially, those, involving, transnational, migration, or, colonial, expansion, ethnicity, is, linked, to, nationality, anthropologists, and, historians, following, the, modernist, understanding, of, ethnicity, as, proposed, by, ernest, gellner, and, benedict, anderson, see, nations, and, nationalism, as, developing, with, the, rise, of, the, modern, state, system, in, the, 17th, century, they, culminated, in, the, rise, of, nation, states, in, which, the, presumptive, boundaries, of, the, nation, coincided, or, ideally, coincided, with, state, boundaries, thus, in, the, west, the, notion, of, ethnicity, like, race, and, nation, developed, in, the, context, of, european, colonial, expansion, when, mercantilism, and, capitalism, were, promoting, global, movements, of, populations, at, the, same, time, that, state, boundaries, were, being, more, clearly, and, rigidly, defined, in, the, 19th, century, modern, states, generally, sought, legitimacy, through, their, claim, to, represent, nations, nation, states, however, invariably, include, populations, who, have, been, excluded, from, national, life, for, one, reason, or, another, members, of, excluded, groups, consequently, will, either, demand, inclusion, based, on, equality, or, seek, autonomy, sometimes, even, to, the, extent, of, complete, political, separation, in, their, nation, state, under, these, conditions, when, people, moved, from, one, state, to, another, or, one, state, conquered, or, colonized, peoples, beyond, its, national, boundaries, ethnic, groups, were, formed, by, people, who, identified, with, one, nation, but, lived, in, another, state, in, the, 1920s, estonia, introduced, a, flexible, system, of, ethnicity, nationality, self, choice, for, its, citizens, which, included, estonians, russians, baltic, germans, and, jews, multi, ethnic, states, can, be, the, result, of, two, opposite, events, either, the, recent, creation, of, state, borders, at, variance, with, traditional, tribal, territories, or, the, recent, immigration, of, ethnic, minorities, into, a, former, nation, state, examples, for, the, first, case, are, found, throughout, africa, where, countries, created, during, decolonization, inherited, arbitrary, colonial, borders, but, also, in, european, countries, such, as, belgium, or, united, kingdom, examples, for, the, second, case, are, countries, such, as, netherlands, which, were, relatively, ethnically, homogeneous, when, they, attained, statehood, but, have, received, significant, immigration, in, the, 17th, century, and, even, more, so, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, states, such, as, the, united, kingdom, france, and, switzerland, comprised, distinct, ethnic, groups, from, their, formation, and, have, likewise, experienced, substantial, immigration, resulting, in, what, has, been, termed, multicultural, societies, especially, in, large, cities, the, states, of, the, new, world, were, multi, ethnic, from, the, onset, as, they, were, formed, as, colonies, imposed, on, existing, indigenous, populations, in, recent, decades, feminist, scholars, most, notably, nira, yuval, davis, have, drawn, attention, to, the, fundamental, ways, in, which, women, participate, in, the, creation, and, reproduction, of, ethnic, and, national, categories, though, these, categories, are, usually, discussed, as, belonging, to, the, public, political, sphere, they, are, upheld, within, the, private, family, sphere, to, a, great, extent, it, is, here, that, women, act, not, just, as, biological, reproducers, but, also, as, cultural, carriers, transmitting, knowledge, and, enforcing, behaviors, that, belong, to, a, specific, collectivity, women, also, often, play, a, significant, symbolic, role, in, conceptions, of, nation, or, ethnicity, for, example, in, the, notion, that, women, and, children, constitute, the, kernel, of, a, nation, which, must, be, defended, in, times, of, conflict, or, in, iconic, figures, such, as, britannia, or, marianne, ethnicity, is, used, as, a, matter, of, cultural, identity, of, a, group, often, based, on, shared, ancestry, language, and, cultural, traditions, while, race, is, applied, as, a, taxonomic, grouping, based, on, physical, similarities, among, groups, race, is, a, more, controversial, subject, than, ethnicity, due, to, common, political, use, of, the, term, ram, n, grosfoguel, university, of, california, berkeley, argues, that, racial, ethnic, identity, is, one, concept, and, concepts, of, race, and, ethnicity, cannot, be, used, as, separate, and, autonomous, categories, before, weber, 1864, 1920, race, and, ethnicity, were, primarily, seen, as, two, aspects, of, the, same, thing, around, 1900, and, before, the, primordialist, understanding, of, ethnicity, predominated, cultural, differences, between, peoples, were, seen, as, being, the, result, of, inherited, traits, and, tendencies, with, weber, s, introduction, of, the, idea, of, ethnicity, as, a, social, construct, race, and, ethnicity, became, more, divided, from, each, other, in, 1950, the, unesco, statement, the, race, question, signed, by, some, of, the, internationally, renowned, scholars, of, the, time, including, ashley, montagu, claude, l, vi, strauss, gunnar, myrdal, julian, huxley, etc, said, national, religious, geographic, linguistic, and, cultural, groups, do, not, necessarily, coincide, with, racial, groups, and, the, cultural, traits, of, such, groups, have, no, demonstrated, genetic, connection, with, racial, traits, because, serious, errors, of, this, kind, are, habitually, committed, when, the, term, race, is, used, in, popular, parlance, it, would, be, better, when, speaking, of, human, races, to, drop, the, term, race, altogether, and, speak, of, ethnic, groups, in, 1982, anthropologist, david, craig, griffith, summed, up, forty, years, of, ethnographic, research, arguing, that, racial, and, ethnic, categories, are, symbolic, markers, for, different, ways, people, from, different, parts, of, the, world, have, been, incorporated, into, a, global, economy, the, opposing, interests, that, divide, the, working, classes, are, further, reinforced, through, appeals, to, racial, and, ethnic, distinctions, such, appeals, serve, to, allocate, different, categories, of, workers, to, rungs, on, the, scale, of, labor, markets, relegating, stigmatized, populations, to, the, lower, levels, and, insulating, the, higher, echelons, from, competition, from, below, capitalism, did, not, create, all, the, distinctions, of, ethnicity, and, race, that, function, to, set, off, categories, of, workers, from, one, another, it, is, nevertheless, the, process, of, labor, mobilization, under, capitalism, that, imparts, to, these, distinctions, their, effective, values, according, to, wolf, racial, categories, were, constructed, and, incorporated, during, the, period, of, european, mercantile, expansion, and, ethnic, groupings, during, the, period, of, capitalist, expansion, writing, in, 1977, about, the, usage, of, the, term, ethnic, in, the, ordinary, language, of, great, britain, and, the, united, states, wallman, noted, the, term, ethnic, popularly, connotes, in, britain, only, less, precisely, and, with, a, lighter, value, load, in, north, america, by, contrast, most, commonly, means, color, and, ethnics, are, the, descendants, of, relatively, recent, immigrants, from, non, english, speaking, countries, is, not, a, noun, in, britain, in, effect, there, are, no, ethnics, there, are, only, ethnic, relations, in, the, u, s, the, omb, says, the, definition, of, race, as, used, for, the, purposes, of, the, us, census, is, not, scientific, or, anthropological, and, takes, into, account, social, and, cultural, characteristics, as, well, as, ancestry, using, appropriate, scientific, methodologies, that, are, not, primarily, biological, or, genetic, in, reference, sometimes, ethnic, groups, are, subject, to, prejudicial, attitudes, and, actions, by, the, state, or, its, constituents, in, the, 20th, century, people, began, to, argue, that, conflicts, among, ethnic, groups, or, between, members, of, an, ethnic, group, and, the, state, can, and, should, be, resolved, in, one, of, two, ways, some, like, j, rgen, habermas, and, bruce, barry, have, argued, that, the, legitimacy, of, modern, states, must, be, based, on, a, notion, of, political, rights, of, autonomous, individual, subjects, according, to, this, view, the, state, should, not, acknowledge, ethnic, national, or, racial, identity, but, rather, instead, enforce, political, and, legal, equality, of, all, individuals, others, like, charles, taylor, and, will, kymlicka, argue, that, the, notion, of, the, autonomous, individual, is, itself, a, cultural, construct, according, to, this, view, states, must, recognize, ethnic, identity, and, develop, processes, through, which,
