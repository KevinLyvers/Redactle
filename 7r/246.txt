goods, services, and, people, in, history, and, a, significant, catalyst, for, economic, development, and, sociopolitical, change, estimated, that, between, 35, and, 40, per, cent, of, tourism, today, is, represented, by, cultural, tourism, or, heritage, tourism, this, alternative, to, mass, tourism, offers, opportunities, for, place, based, engagement, that, frames, context, for, interaction, by,
