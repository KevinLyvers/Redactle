human, rights, are, moral, principles, or, norms, that, establish, standards, of, human, behaviour, and, are, regularly, protected, as, substantive, rights, in, municipal, and, international, law, they, are, commonly, understood, as, inalienable, fundamental, rights, to, which, a, person, is, inherently, entitled, simply, because, he, or, she, is, a, human, being, and, which, are, inherent, in, all, human, beings, regardless, of, age, ethnic, origin, location, language, religion, ethnicity, or, any, other, status, they, are, applicable, everywhere, and, at, all, times, in, the, sense, of, being, universal, and, they, are, egalitarian, in, the, sense, of, being, the, same, for, everyone, they, are, regarded, as, requiring, empathy, and, the, rule, of, law, and, imposing, an, obligation, on, individuals, to, respect, the, human, rights, of, others, it, is, generally, considered, that, they, should, not, be, taken, away, except, as, a, result, of, due, process, based, on, specific, circumstances, the, doctrine, of, human, rights, has, been, highly, influential, within, international, law, and, global, and, regional, institutions, the, precise, meaning, of, the, term, right, is, controversial, and, remains, the, subject, of, ongoing, philosophical, debate, while, there, is, consensus, that, human, rights, encompass, a, wide, variety, of, rights, such, as, the, right, to, a, fair, trial, protection, against, enslavement, prohibition, of, genocide, free, speech, and, the, right, to, education, there, is, disagreement, about, which, of, these, particular, rights, should, be, included, within, the, general, framework, of, human, rights, some, thinkers, suggest, that, human, rights, should, serve, as, a, minimum, requirement, to, avoid, the, worst, case, abuses, while, others, see, it, as, a, higher, standard, many, of, the, basic, ideas, that, animated, the, human, rights, movement, developed, in, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, and, the, events, of, the, holocaust, culminating, in, the, adoption, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, paris, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, 1948, ancient, peoples, did, not, share, the, modern, day, conception, of, universal, human, rights, the, true, forerunner, of, human, rights, discourse, was, the, concept, of, natural, rights, which, first, appeared, as, part, of, the, medieval, natural, law, tradition, and, developed, in, new, directions, during, the, european, enlightenment, with, philosophers, such, as, john, locke, francis, hutcheson, and, jean, jacques, burlamaqui, this, concept, featured, prominently, in, the, political, discourse, of, the, american, revolution, and, the, french, revolution, from, this, foundation, modern, human, rights, arguments, emerged, over, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, possibly, as, a, reaction, to, slavery, torture, genocide, and, war, crimes, many, of, the, basic, ideas, that, animated, the, human, rights, movement, developed, in, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, and, the, events, of, the, holocaust, culminating, in, the, adoption, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, paris, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, 1948, ancient, peoples, did, not, have, the, same, modern, day, conception, of, universal, human, rights, however, the, concept, has, in, some, sense, existed, for, centuries, although, not, in, the, same, way, as, today, the, true, forerunner, of, human, rights, discourse, was, the, concept, of, natural, rights, which, first, appeared, as, part, of, the, medieval, natural, law, tradition, it, developed, in, new, directions, during, the, european, enlightenment, with, such, philosophers, as, john, locke, francis, hutcheson, and, jean,

arguments, emerged, over, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, possibly, as, a, reaction, to, slavery, torture, genocide, and, war, crimes, the, medieval, natural, law, tradition, was, heavily, influenced, by, the, writings, of, st, paul, s, early, christian, thinkers, such, as, st, hilary, of, poitiers, st, ambrose, and, st, augustine, augustine, was, among, the, earliest, to, examine, the, legitimacy, of, the, laws, of, man, and, attempt, to, define, the, boundaries, of, what, laws, and, rights, occur, naturally, based, on, wisdom, and, conscience, instead, of, being, arbitrarily, imposed, by, mortals, and, if, people, are, obligated, to, obey, laws, that, are, unjust, spanish, scholasticism, insisted, on, a, subjective, vision, of, law, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, luis, de, molina, domingo, de, soto, and, francisco, vitoria, members, of, the, school, of, salamanca, defined, law, as, a, moral, power, over, one, s, own, 50, although, they, maintained, at, the, same, time, the, idea, of, law, as, an, objective, order, they, stated, that, there, are, certain, natural, rights, mentioning, both, rights, related, to, the, body, right, to, life, to, property, and, to, the, spirit, right, to, freedom, of, thought, dignity, the, jurist, v, zquez, de, menchaca, starting, from, an, individualist, philosophy, was, decisive, in, the, dissemination, of, the, term, iura, naturalia, this, natural, law, thinking, was, supported, by, contact, with, american, civilizations, and, the, debate, that, took, place, in, castile, about, the, just, titles, of, the, conquest, and, in, particular, the, nature, of, the, indigenous, people, in, the, castilian, colonization, of, america, it, is, often, stated, measures, were, applied, in, which, the, germs, of, the, idea, of, human, rights, are, present, debated, in, the, well, known, valladolid, debate, that, took, place, in, 1550, and, 1551, the, thought, of, the, school, of, salamanca, especially, through, francisco, vitoria, also, contributed, to, the, promotion, of, european, natural, law, from, this, foundation, the, modern, human, rights, arguments, emerged, over, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, magna, carta, is, an, english, charter, originally, issued, in, 1215, which, influenced, the, development, of, the, common, law, and, many, later, constitutional, documents, related, to, human, rights, such, as, the, 1689, english, bill, of, rights, the, 1789, united, states, constitution, and, the, 1791, united, states, bill, of, rights, 17th, century, english, philosopher, john, locke, discussed, natural, rights, in, his, work, identifying, them, as, being, life, liberty, and, estate, property, and, argued, that, such, fundamental, rights, could, not, be, surrendered, in, the, social, contract, in, britain, in, 1689, the, english, bill, of, rights, and, the, scottish, claim, of, right, each, made, a, range, of, oppressive, governmental, actions, illegal, two, major, revolutions, occurred, during, the, 18th, century, in, the, united, states, 1776, and, in, france, 1789, leading, to, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, and, the, french, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, respectively, both, of, which, articulated, certain, human, rights, additionally, the, virginia, declaration, of, rights, of, 1776, encoded, into, law, a, number, of, fundamental, civil, rights, and, civil, freedoms, we, hold, these, truths, to, be, self, evident, that, all, men, are, created, equal, that, they, are, endowed, by, their, creator, with, certain, unalienable, rights, that, among, these, are, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, philosophers, such, as, thomas, paine, john, stuart, mill, and, hegel, expanded, on, the, theme, of, universality, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, in, 1831, william, lloyd, garrison, wrote, in, a, newspaper, called, the, liberator, that, he, was, trying, to, enlist, his, readers, in, the, great, cause, of, human, rights, so, the, term, human, rights, probably, came, into, use, sometime, between, paine, s, the, rights, of, man, and, garrison, s, publication, in, 1849, a, contemporary, henry, david, thoreau, wrote, about, human, rights, in, his, treatise, on, the, duty, of, civil, disobedience, which, was, later, influential, on, human, rights, and, civil, rights, thinkers, united, states, supreme, court, justice, david, davis, in, his, 1867, opinion, for, ex, parte, milligan, wrote, by, the, protection, of, the, law, human, rights, are, secured, withdraw, that, protection, and, they, are, at, the, mercy, of, wicked, rulers, or, the, clamor, of, an, excited, people, many, groups, and, movements, have, managed, to, achieve, profound, social, changes, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, name, of, human, rights, in, western, europe, and, north, america, labour, unions, brought, about, laws, granting, workers, the, right, to, strike, establishing, minimum, work, conditions, and, forbidding, or, regulating, child, labour, the, women, s, rights, movement, succeeded, in, gaining, for, many, women, the, right, to, vote, national, liberation, movements, in, many, countries, succeeded, in, driving, out, colonial, powers, one, of, the, most, influential, was, mahatma, gandhi, s, leadership, of, the, indian, independence, movement, movements, by, long, oppressed, racial, and, religious, minorities, succeeded, in, many, parts, of, the, world, among, them, the, civil, rights, movement, and, more, recent, diverse, identity, politics, movements, on, behalf, of, women, and, minorities, in, the, united, states, the, foundation, of, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, the, 1864, lieber, code, and, the, first, of, the, geneva, conventions, in, 1864, laid, the, foundations, of, international, humanitarian, law, to, be, further, developed, following, the, two, world, wars, the, league, of, nations, was, established, in, 1919, at, the, negotiations, over, the, treaty, of, versailles, following, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, league, s, goals, included, disarmament, preventing, war, through, collective, security, settling, disputes, between, countries, through, negotiation, diplomacy, and, improving, global, welfare, enshrined, in, its, charter, was, a, mandate, to, promote, many, of, the, rights, which, were, later, included, in, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, the, league, of, nations, had, mandates, to, support, many, of, the, former, colonies, of, the, western, european, colonial, powers, during, their, transition, from, colony, to, independent, state, established, as, an, agency, of, the, league, of, nations, and, now, part, of, united, nations, the, international, labour, organization, also, had, a, mandate, to, promote, and, safeguard, certain, of, the, rights, later, included, in, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, udhr, the, primary, goal, of, the, ilo, today, is, to, promote, opportunities, for, women, and, men, to, obtain, decent, and, productive, work, in, conditions, of, freedom, equity, security, and, human, dignity, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, udhr, is, a, non, binding, declaration, adopted, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, 1948, partly, in, response, to, the, events, of, world, war, ii, the, udhr, urges, member, states, to, promote, a, number, of, human, civil, economic, and, social, rights, asserting, these, rights, are, part, of, the, foundation, of, freedom, justice, and, peace, in, the, world, the, declaration, was, the, first, international, legal, effort, to, limit, the, behavior, of, states, and, make, sure, they, did, their, duties, to, their, citizens, following, the, model, of, the, rights, duty, duality, recognition, of, the, inherent, dignity, and, of, the, equal, and, inalienable, rights, of, all, members, of, the, human, family, is, the, foundation, of, freedom, justice, and, peace, in, the, world, the, udhr, was, framed, by, members, of, the, human, rights, commission, with, eleanor, roosevelt, as, chair, who, began, to, discuss, an, international, bill, of, rights, in, 1947, the, members, of, the, commission, did, not, immediately, agree, on, the, form, of, such, a, bill, of, rights, and, whether, or, how, it, should, be, enforced, the, commission, proceeded, to, frame, the, udhr, and, accompanying, treaties, but, the, udhr, quickly, became, the, priority, canadian, law, professor, john, humprey, and, french, lawyer, ren, cassin, were, responsible, for, much, of, the, cross, national, research, and, the, structure, of, the, document, respectively, where, the, articles, of, the, declaration, were, interpretative, of, the, general, principle, of, the, preamble, the, document, was, structured, by, cassin, to, include, the, basic, principles, of, dignity, liberty, equality, and, brotherhood, in, the, first, two, articles, followed, successively, by, rights, pertaining, to, individuals, rights, of, individuals, in, relation, to, each, other, and, to, groups, spiritual, public, and, political, rights, and, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, the, final, three, articles, place, according, to, cassin, rights, in, the, context, of, limits, duties, and, the, social, and, political, order, in, which, they, are, to, be, realized, humphrey, and, cassin, intended, the, rights, in, the, udhr, to, be, legally, enforceable, through, some, means, as, is, reflected, in, the, third, clause, of, the, preamble, whereas, it, is, essential, if, man, is, not, to, be, compelled, to, have, recourse, as, a, last, resort, to, rebellion, against, tyranny, and, oppression, that, human, rights, should, be, protected, by, the, rule, of, law, some, of, the, udhr, was, researched, and, written, by, a, committee, of, international, experts, on, human, rights, including, representatives, from, all, continents, and, all, major, religions, and, drawing, on, consultation, with, leaders, such, as, mahatma, gandhi, the, inclusion, of, both, civil, and, political, rights, and, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, was, predicated, on, the, assumption, that, basic, human, rights, are, indivisible, and, that, the, different, types, of, rights, listed, are, inextricably, linked, although, this, principle, was, not, opposed, by, any, member, states, at, the, time, of, adoption, the, declaration, was, adopted, unanimously, with, the, abstention, of, the, soviet, bloc, apartheid, south, africa, and, saudi, arabia, this, principle, was, later, subject, to, significant, challenges, on, the, issue, of, the, term, universal, the, declarations, did, not, apply, to, domestic, discrimination, or, racism, henry, j, richardson, iii, argued, the, onset, of, the, cold, war, soon, after, the, udhr, was, conceived, brought, to, the, fore, divisions, over, the, inclusion, of, both, economic, and, social, rights, and, civil, and, political, rights, in, the, declaration, capitalist, states, tended, to, place, strong, emphasis, on, civil, and, political, rights, such, as, freedom, of, association, and, expression, and, were, reluctant, to, include, economic, and, social, rights, such, as, the, right, to, work, and, the, right, to, join, a, union, socialist, states, placed, much, greater, importance, on, economic, and, social, rights, and, argued, strongly, for, their, inclusion, because, of, the, divisions, over, which, rights, to, include, and, because, some, states, declined, to, ratify, any, treaties, including, certain, specific, interpretations, of, human, rights, and, despite, the, soviet, bloc, and, a, number, of, developing, countries, arguing, strongly, for, the, inclusion, of, all, rights, in, a, unity, resolution, the, rights, enshrined, in, the, udhr, were, split, into, two, separate, covenants, allowing, states, to, adopt, some, rights, and, derogate, others, although, this, allowed, the, covenants, to, be, created, it, denied, the, proposed, principle, that, all, rights, are, linked, which, was, central, to, some, interpretations, of, the, udhr, although, the, udhr, is, a, non, binding, resolution, it, is, now, considered, to, be, a, central, component, of, international, customary, law, which, may, be, invoked, under, appropriate, circumstances, by, state, judiciaries, and, other, judiciaries, in, 1966, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, iccpr, and, the, international, covenant, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, icescr, were, adopted, by, the, united, nations, between, them, making, the, rights, contained, in, the, udhr, binding, on, all, states, they, came, into, force, only, in, 1976, when, they, were, ratified, by, a, sufficient, number, of, countries, despite, achieving, the, iccpr, a, covenant, including, no, economic, or, social, rights, the, us, only, ratified, the, iccpr, in, 1992, the, icescr, commits, 155, state, parties, to, work, toward, the, granting, of, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, escr, to, individuals, numerous, other, treaties, pieces, of, legislation, have, been, offered, at, the, international, level, they, are, generally, known, as, human, rights, instruments, some, of, the, most, significant, are, in, 2021, the, united, nations, human, rights, council, officially, recognized, having, a, clean, healthy, and, sustainable, environment, as, a, human, right, in, april, 2024, the, european, court, of, human, rights, ruled, for, the, first, time, in, history, that, the, swiss, government, had, violated, human, rights, by, not, acting, strongly, enough, to, stop, climate, change, responsibility, to, protect, refers, to, a, doctrine, for, united, nations, member, states, to, intervene, to, protect, populations, from, atrocities, it, has, been, cited, as, justification, in, the, use, of, recent, military, interventions, an, example, of, an, intervention, that, is, often, criticized, is, the, 2011, military, intervention, in, the, first, libyan, civil, war, by, nato, and, qatar, where, the, goal, of, preventing, atrocities, is, alleged, to, have, taken, upon, itself, the, broader, mandate, of, removing, the, target, government, economic, sanctions, are, often, levied, upon, individuals, or, states, who, commit, human, rights, violations, sanctions, are, often, criticized, for, its, feature, of, collective, punishment, in, hurting, a, country, s, population, economically, in, order, dampen, that, population, s, view, of, its, government, it, is, also, argued, that, counterproductively, sanctions, on, offending, authoritarian, governments, strengthen, that, government, s, position, domestically, as, governments, would, still, have, more, mechanisms, to, find, funding, than, their, critics, and, opposition, who, become, further, weakened, the, risk, of, human, rights, violations, increases, with, the, increase, in, financially, vulnerable, populations, girls, from, poor, families, in, non, industrialized, economies, are, often, viewed, as, a, financial, burden, on, the, family, and, marriage, of, young, girls, is, often, driven, in, the, hope, that, daughters, will, be, fed, and, protected, by, wealthier, families, female, genital, mutilation, and, force, feeding, of, daughters, is, argued, to, be, similarly, driven, in, large, part, to, increase, their, marriage, prospects, and, thus, their, financial, security, by, achieving, certain, idealized, standards, of, beauty, in, certain, areas, girls, requiring, the, experience, of, sexual, initiation, rites, with, men, and, passing, sex, training, tests, on, girls, are, designed, to, make, them, more, appealing, as, marriage, prospects, measures, to, help, the, economic, status, of, vulnerable, groups, in, order, to, reduce, human, rights, violations, include, girls, education, and, guaranteed, minimum, incomes, and, conditional, cash, transfers, such, as, bolsa, familia, which, subsidize, parents, who, keep, children, in, school, rather, than, contributing, to, family, income, has, successfully, reduced, child, labor, human, rights, abuses, are, monitored, by, united, nations, committees, national, institutions, and, governments, and, by, many, independent, non, governmental, organizations, such, as, amnesty, international, human, rights, watch, world, organisation, against, torture, freedom, house, international, freedom, of, expression, exchange, and, anti, slavery, international, these, organisations, collect, evidence, and, documentation, of, human, rights, abuses, and, apply, pressure, to, promote, human, rights, educating, people, on, the, concept, of, human, rights, has, been, argued, as, a, strategy, to, prevent, human, rights, abuses, many, examples, of, legal, instruments, at, the, international, regional, and, national, level, described, below, are,

2009, the, asean, intergovernmental, commission, on, human, rights, was, inaugurated, and, subsequently, the, asean, human, rights, declaration, was, adopted, unanimously, by, asean, members, on, 18, november, 2012, the, arab, charter, on, human, rights, achr, was, adopted, by, the, council, of, the, league, of, arab, states, on, 22, may, 2004, the, council, of, europe, founded, in, 1949, is, the, oldest, organisation, working, for, european, integration, it, is, an, international, organisation, with, legal, personality, recognised, under, public, international, law, and, has, observer, status, with, the, united, nations, the, seat, of, the, council, of, europe, is, in, strasbourg, in, france, the, council, of, europe, is, responsible, for, both, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, and, the, european, court, of, human, rights, these, institutions, bind, the, council, s, members, to, a, code, of, human, rights, which, though, strict, are, more, lenient, than, those, of, the, united, nations, charter, on, human, rights, the, council, also, promotes, the, european, charter, for, regional, or, minority, languages, and, the, european, social, charter, membership, is, open, to, all, european, states, which, seek, european, integration, accept, the, principle, of, the, rule, of, law, and, are, able, and, willing, to, guarantee, democracy, fundamental, human, rights, and, freedoms, the, council, of, europe, is, an, organisation, that, is, not, part, of, the, european, union, but, the, latter, is, expected, to, accede, to, the, european, convention, and, potentially, the, council, itself, the, eu, has, its, own, human, rights, document, the, charter, of, fundamental, rights, of, the, european, union, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, defines, and, guarantees, since, 1950, human, rights, and, fundamental, freedoms, in, europe, all, 47, member, states, of, the, council, of, europe, have, signed, this, convention, and, are, therefore, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, european, court, of, human, rights, in, strasbourg, in, order, to, prevent, torture, and, inhuman, or, degrading, treatment, article, 3, of, the, convention, the, european, committee, for, the, prevention, of, torture, was, established, several, theoretical, approaches, have, been, advanced, to, explain, how, and, why, human, rights, become, part, of, social, expectations, one, of, the, oldest, western, philosophies, on, human, rights, is, that, they, are, a, product, of, a, natural, law, stemming, from, different, philosophical, or, religious, grounds, other, theories, hold, that, human, rights, codify, moral, behavior, which, is, a, human, social, product, developed, by, a, process, of, biological, and, social, evolution, associated, with, david, hume, human, rights, are, also, described, as, a, sociological, pattern, of, rule, setting, as, in, the, sociological, theory, of, law, and, the, work, of, max, weber, these, approaches, include, the, notion, that, individuals, in, a, society, accept, rules, from, legitimate, authority, in, exchange, for, security, and, economic, advantage, as, in, john, rawls, a, social, contract, natural, law, theories, base, human, rights, on, a, natural, moral, religious, or, even, biological, order, which, is, independent, of, transitory, human, laws, or, traditions, socrates, and, his, philosophic, heirs, plato, and, aristotle, posited, the, existence, of, natural, justice, or, natural, right, dikaion, physikon, latin, ius, naturale, of, these, aristotle, is, often, said, to, be, the, father, of, natural, law, although, evidence, for, this, is, due, largely, to, the, interpretations, of, his, work, by, thomas, aquinas, the, development, of, this, tradition, of, natural, justice, into, one, of, natural, law, is, usually, attributed, to, the, stoics, some, of, the, early, church, fathers, sought, to, incorporate, the, until, then, pagan, concept, of, natural, law, into, christianity, natural, law, theories, have, featured, greatly, in, the, philosophies, of, thomas, aquinas, francisco, su, rez, richard, hooker, thomas, hobbes, hugo, grotius, samuel, von, pufendorf, and, john, locke, in, the, 17th, century, thomas, hobbes, founded, a, contractualist, theory, of, legal, positivism, on, what, all, men, could, agree, upon, what, they, sought, happiness, was, subject, to, contention, but, a, broad, consensus, could, form, around, what, they, feared, violent, death, at, the, hands, of, another, the, natural, law, was, how, a, rational, human, being, seeking, to, survive, and, prosper, would, act, it, was, discovered, by, considering, humankind, s, natural, rights, whereas, previously, it, could, be, said, that, natural, rights, were, discovered, by, considering, the, natural, law, in, hobbes, opinion, the, only, way, natural, law, could, prevail, was, for, men, to, submit, to, the, commands, of, the, sovereign, in, this, lay, the, foundations, of, the, theory, of, a, social, contract, between, the, governed, and, the, governor, hugo, grotius, based, his, philosophy, of, international, law, on, natural, law, he, wrote, that, even, the, will, of, an, omnipotent, being, cannot, change, or, abrogate, natural, law, which, would, maintain, its, objective, validity, even, if, we, should, assume, the, impossible, that, there, is, no, god, or, that, he, does, not, care, for, human, affairs, de, iure, belli, ac, pacis, prolegomeni, xi, this, is, the, famous, argument, etiamsi, daremus, non, esse, deum, that, made, natural, law, no, longer, dependent, on, theology, john, locke, incorporated, natural, law, into, many, of, his, theories, and, philosophy, especially, in, two, treatises, of, government, locke, turned, hobbes, prescription, around, saying, that, if, the, ruler, went, against, natural, law, and, failed, to, protect, life, liberty, and, property, people, could, justifiably, overthrow, the, existing, state, and, create, a, new, one, the, belgian, philosopher, of, law, frank, van, dun, is, one, among, those, who, are, elaborating, a, secular, conception, of, natural, law, in, the, liberal, tradition, there, are, also, emerging, and, secular, forms, of, natural, law, theory, that, define, human, rights, as, derivative, of, the, notion, of, universal, human, dignity, the, term, human, rights, has, replaced, the, term, natural, rights, in, popularity, because, the, rights, are, less, and, less, frequently, seen, as, requiring, natural, law, for, their, existence, the, philosopher, john, finnis, argues, that, human, rights, are, justifiable, on, the, grounds, of, their, instrumental, value, in, creating, the, necessary, conditions, for, human, well, being, interest, theories, highlight, the, duty, to, respect, the, rights, of, other, individuals, on, grounds, of, self, interest, human, rights, law, applied, to, a, state, s, own, citizens, serves, the, interest, of, states, by, for, example, minimizing, the, risk, of, violent, resistance, and, protest, and, by, keeping, the, level, of, dissatisfaction, with, the, government, manageable, the, biological, theory, considers, the, comparative, reproductive, advantage, of, human, social, behavior, based, on, empathy, and, altruism, in, the, context, of, natural, selection, the, philosopher, zhao, tingyang, argues, that, the, traditional, human, rights, framework, fails, to, be, universal, because, it, arose, from, contingent, aspects, of, western, culture, and, that, the, concept, of, inalienable, and, unconditional, human, rights, is, in, tension, with, the, principle, of, justice, he, proposes, an, alternative, framework, called, credit, human, rights, in, which, rights, are, tied, to, responsibilities, the, most, common, categorization, of, human, rights, is, to, split, them, into, civil, and, political, rights, and, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, civil, and, political, rights, are, enshrined, in, articles, 3, to, 21, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, and, in, the, iccpr, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, are, enshrined, in, articles, 22, to, 28, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, and, in, the, icescr, the, udhr, included, both, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, and, civil, and, political, rights, because, it, was, based, on, the, principle, that, the, different, rights, could, only, successfully, exist, in, combination, the, ideal, of, free, human, beings, enjoying, civil, and, political, freedom, and, freedom, from, fear, and, want, can, only, be, achieved, if, conditions, are, created, whereby, everyone, may, enjoy, his, civil, and, political, rights, as, well, as, his, social, economic, and, cultural, rights, this, is, held, to, be, true, because, without, civil, and, political, rights, the, public, cannot, assert, their, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, similarly, without, livelihoods, and, a, working, society, the, public, cannot, assert, or, make, use, of, civil, or, political, rights, known, as, the, full, belly, thesis, although, accepted, by, the, signatories, to, the, udhr, most, of, them, do, not, in, practice, give, equal, weight, to, the, different, types, of, rights, western, cultures, have, often, given, priority, to, civil, and, political, rights, sometimes, at, the, expense, of, economic, and, social, rights, such, as, the, right, to, work, to, education, health, and, housing, for, example, in, the, united, states, there, is, no, universal, access, to, healthcare, free, at, the, point, of, use, that, is, not, to, say, that, western, cultures, have, overlooked, these, rights, entirely, the, welfare, states, that, exist, in, western, europe, are, evidence, of, this, similarly, the, ex, soviet, bloc, countries, and, asian, countries, have, tended, to, give, priority, to, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, but, have, often, failed, to, provide, civil, and, political, rights, another, categorization, offered, by, karel, vasak, is, that, there, are, three, generations, of, human, rights, first, generation, civil, and, political, rights, right, to, life, and, political, participation, second, generation, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, right, to, subsistence, and, third, generation, solidarity, rights, right, to, peace, right, to, clean, environment, out, of, these, generations, the, third, generation, is, the, most, debated, and, lacks, both, legal, and, political, recognition, this, categorisation, is, at, odds, with, the, indivisibility, of, rights, as, it, implicitly, states, that, some, rights, can, exist, without, others, prioritisation, of, rights, for, pragmatic, reasons, is, however, a, widely, accepted, necessity, human, rights, expert, philip, alston, argues, if, every, possible, human, rights, element, is, deemed, to, be, essential, or, necessary, then, nothing, will, be, treated, as, though, it, is, truly, important, he, and, others, urge, caution, with, prioritisation, of, rights, the, call, for, prioritizing, is, not, to, suggest, that, any, obvious, violations, of, rights, can, be, ignored, priorities, where, necessary, should, adhere, to, core, concepts, such, as, reasonable, attempts, at, progressive, realization, and, principles, such, as, non, discrimination, equality, and, participation, some, human, rights, are, said, to, be, inalienable, rights, the, term, inalienable, rights, or, unalienable, rights, refers, to, a, set, of, human, rights, that, are, fundamental, are, not, awarded, by, human, power, and, cannot, be, surrendered, the, adherence, to, the, principle, of, indivisibility, by, the, international, community, was, reaffirmed, in, 1995, all, human, rights, are, universal, indivisible, and, interdependent, and, related, the, international, community, must, treat, human, rights, globally, in, a, fair, and, equal, manner, on, the, same, footing, and, with, the, same, emphasis, this, statement, was, again, endorsed, at, the, 2005, world, summit, in, new, york, paragraph, 121, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, enshrines, by, definition, rights, that, apply, to, all, humans, equally, whichever, geographical, location, state, race, or, culture, they, belong, to, proponents, of, cultural, relativism, suggest, that, human, rights, are, not, all, universal, and, indeed, conflict, with, some, cultures, and, threaten, their, survival, rights, which, are, most, often, contested, with, relativistic, arguments, are, the, rights, of, women, for, example, female, genital, mutilation, occurs, in, different, cultures, in, africa, asia, and, south, america, it, is, not, mandated, by, any, religion, but, has, become, a, tradition, in, many, cultures, it, is, considered, a, violation, of, women, s, and, girl, s, rights, by, much, of, the, international, community, and, is, outlawed, in, some, countries, universalism, has, been, described, by, some, as, cultural, economic, or, political, imperialism, in, particular, the, concept, of, human, rights, is, often, claimed, to, be, fundamentally, rooted, in, a, politically, liberal, outlook, which, although, generally, accepted, in, europe, japan, or, north, america, is, not, necessarily, taken, as, standard, elsewhere, for, example, in, 1981, the, iranian, representative, to, the, united, nations, said, rajaie, khorassani, articulated, the, position, of, his, country, regarding, the, udhr, by, saying, that, the, udhr, was, a, secular, understanding, of, the, judeo, christian, tradition, which, could, not, be, implemented, by, muslims, without, trespassing, the, islamic, law, the, former, prime, ministers, of, singapore, lee, kuan, yew, and, of, malaysia, mahathir, mohamad, both, claimed, in, the, 1990s, that, asian, values, were, significantly, different, from, western, values, and, included, a, sense, of, loyalty, and, foregoing, personal, freedoms, for, the, sake, of, social, stability, and, prosperity, and, therefore, authoritarian, government, is, more, appropriate, in, asia, than, democracy, this, view, is, countered, by, mahathir, s, former, deputy, to, say, that, freedom, is, western, or, unasian, is, to, offend, our, traditions, as, well, as, our, forefathers, who, gave, their, lives, in, the, struggle, against, tyranny, and, injustices, singapore, s, opposition, leader, chee, soon, juan, also, states, that, it, is, racist, to, assert, that, asians, do, not, want, human, rights, an, appeal, is, often, made, to, the, fact, that, influential, human, rights, thinkers, such, as, john, locke, and, john, stuart, mill, have, all, been, western, and, indeed, that, some, were, involved, in, the, running, of, empires, themselves, relativistic, arguments, tend, to, neglect, the, fact, that, modern, human, rights, are, new, to, all, cultures, dating, back, no, further, than, the, udhr, in, 1948, they, also, do, not, account, for, the, fact, that, the, udhr, was, drafted, by, people, from, many, different, cultures, and, traditions, including, a, us, roman, catholic, a, chinese, confucian, philosopher, a, french, zionist, and, a, representative, from, the, arab, league, amongst, others, and, drew, upon, advice, from, thinkers, such, as, mahatma, gandhi, michael, ignatieff, has, argued, that, cultural, relativism, is, almost, exclusively, an, argument, used, by, those, who, wield, power, in, cultures, which, commit, human, rights, abuses, and, that, those, whose, human, rights, are, compromised, are, the, powerless, this, reflects, the, fact, that, the, difficulty, in, judging, universalism, versus, relativism, lies, in, who, is, claiming, to, represent, a, particular, culture, although, the, argument, between, universalism, and, relativism, is, far, from, complete, it, is, an, academic, discussion, in, that, all, international, human, rights, instruments, adhere, to, the, principle, that, human, rights, are, universally, applicable, the, 2005, world, summit, reaffirmed, the, international, community, s, adherence, to, this, principle, the, universal, nature, of, human, rights, and, freedoms, is, beyond, question, universal, jurisdiction, is, a, controversial, principle, in, international, law, whereby, states, claim, criminal, jurisdiction, over, persons, whose, alleged, crimes, were, committed, outside, the, boundaries, of, the, prosecuting, state, regardless, of, nationality, country, of, residence, or, any, other, relation, with, the, prosecuting, country, the, state, backs, its, claim, on, the, grounds, that, the, crime, committed, is, considered, a, crime, against, all, which, any, state, is, authorized, to, punish, the, concept, of, universal, jurisdiction, is, therefore, closely, linked, to, the, idea, that, certain, international, norms, are, erga, omnes, or, owed, to, the, entire, world, community, as, well, as, the, concept, of, jus, cogens, in, 1993, belgium, passed, a, law, of, universal, jurisdiction, to, give, its, court, s, jurisdiction, over, crimes, against, humanity, in, other, countries, and, in, 1998, augusto, pinochet, was, arrested, in, london, following, an, indictment, by, spanish, judge, baltasar, garz, n, under, the, universal, jurisdiction, principle, the, principle, is, supported, by, amnesty, international, and, other, human, rights, organisations, as, they, believe, certain, crimes, pose, a, threat, to, the, international, community, as, a, whole, and, the, community, has, a, moral, duty, to, act, but, others, including, henry, kissinger, argue, that, state, sovereignty, is, paramount, because, breaches, of, rights, committed, in, other, countries, are, outside, states, sovereign, interest, and, because, states, could, use, the, principle, for, political, reasons, companies, ngos, political, parties, informal, groups, and, individuals, are, known, as, non, state, actors, non, state, actors, can, also, commit, human, rights, abuses, but, are, not, subject, to, human, rights, law, other, than, international, humanitarian, law, which, applies, to, individuals, multinational, companies, play, an, increasingly, large, role, in, the, world, and, are, responsible, for, a, large, number, of, human, rights, abuses, although, the, legal, and, moral, environment, surrounding, the, actions, of, governments, is, reasonably, well, developed, that, surrounding, multinational, companies, is, both, controversial, and, ill, defined, multinational, companies, often, view, their, primary, responsibility, as, being, to, their, shareholders, not, to, those, affected, by, their, actions, such, companies, are, often, larger, than, the, economies, of, the, states, in, which, they, operate, and, can, wield, significant, economic, and, political, power, no, international, treaties, exist, to, specifically, cover, the, behavior, of, companies, with, regard, to, human, rights, and, national, legislation, is, very, variable, jean, ziegler, special, rapporteur, of, the, un, commission, on, human, rights, on, the, right, to, food, stated, in, a, report, in, 2003, the, growing, power, of, transnational, corporations, and, their, extension, of, power, through, privatization, deregulation, and, the, rolling, back, of, the, state, also, mean, that, it, is, now, time, to, develop, binding, legal, norms, that, hold, corporations, to, human, rights, standards, and, circumscribe, potential, abuses, of, their, position, of, power, in, august, 2003, the, human, rights, commission, s, sub, commission, on, the, promotion, and, protection, of, human, rights, produced, draft, norms, on, the, responsibilities, of, transnational, corporations, and, other, business, enterprises, with, regard, to, human, rights, these, were, considered, by, the, human, rights, commission, in, 2004, but, have, no, binding, status, on, corporations, and, are, not, monitored, additionally, the, united, nations,

rights, international, conventions, class, the, right, to, life, the, right, to, be, free, from, slavery, the, right, to, be, free, from, torture, and, the, right, to, be, free, from, retroactive, application, of, penal, laws, as, non, derogable, the, un, recognises, that, human, rights, can, be, limited, or, even, pushed, aside, during, times, of, national, emergency, although, it, clarifies, the, emergency, must, be, actual, affect, the, whole, population, and, the, threat, must, be, to, the, very, existence, of, the, nation, the, declaration, of, emergency, must, also, be, a, last, resort, and, a, temporary, measure, rights, that, cannot, be, derogated, for, reasons, of, national, security, in, any, circumstances, are, known, as, peremptory, norms, or, jus, cogens, such, international, law, obligations, are, binding, on, all, states, and, cannot, be, modified, by, treaty, critics, of, the, view, that, human, rights, are, universal, argue, that, human, rights, are, a, western, concept, that, emanate, from, a, european, judeo, christian, and, or, enlightenment, heritage, typically, labeled, western, and, cannot, be, enjoyed, by, other, cultures, that, don, t, emulate, the, conditions, and, values, of, western, societies, right, wing, critics, of, human, rights, argue, that, they, are, unrealistic, and, unenforceable, norms, and, inappropriate, intrusions, on, state, sovereignty, while, left, wing, critics, of, human, rights, argue, that, they, fail, to, achieve, or, prevents, better, approaches, to, achieving, progressive, goals
