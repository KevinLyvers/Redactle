https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency
an, insurgency, is, a, violent, armed, rebellion, by, small, lightly, armed, bands, who, practice, guerrilla, warfare, against, a, larger, authority, the, key, descriptive, feature, of, insurgency, is, its, asymmetric, nature, small, irregular, forces, face, a, large, well, equipped, regular, military, force, state, adversary, due, to, this, asymmetry, insurgents, avoid, large, scale, direct, battles, opting, instead, to, blend, in, with, the, civilian, population, often, in, rural, areas, where, they, gradually, expand, territorial, control, and, military, forces, insurgency, frequently, hinges, on, control, of, and, collaboration, with, local, populations, an, insurgency, can, be, fought, via, counter, insurgency, warfare, as, well, as, other, political, economic, and, social, actions, of, various, kinds, due, to, the, blending, of, insurgents, with, the, civilian, population, insurgencies, tend, to, involve, considerable, violence, against, civilians, by, the, state, and, the, insurgents, state, attempts, to, quell, insurgencies, frequently, lead, to, the, infliction, of, indiscriminate, violence, whereas, rebel, control, of, territory, frequently, involves, violence, against, the, civilian, population, insurgency, sets, itself, apart, from, terrorism, by, aiming, for, political, control, rather, than, resorting, to, indiscriminate, violence, however, it, may, incorporate, terrorist, tactics, where, a, revolt, takes, the, form, of, armed, rebellion, it, may, not, be, viewed, as, an, insurgency, if, a, state, of, belligerency, exists, between, one, or, more, sovereign, states, and, rebel, forces, for, example, during, the, american, civil, war, the, confederate, states, of, america, was, not, recognized, as, a, sovereign, state, but, it, was, recognized, as, a, belligerent, power, and, thus, confederate, warships, were, given, the, same, rights, as, united, states, warships, in, foreign, ports, sometimes, there, may, be, two, or, more, simultaneous, insurgencies, multipolar, occurring, in, a, country, the, iraq, insurgency, is, one, example, of, a, recognized, government, versus, multiple, groups, of, insurgents, other, historic, insurgencies, such, as, the, russian, civil, war, have, been, multipolar, rather, than, a, straightforward, model, made, up, of, two, sides, during, the, angolan, civil, war, there, were, two, main, sides, mpla, and, unita, at, the, same, time, there, was, another, separatist, movement, for, the, independence, of, the, cabinda, region, headed, up, by, flec, multipolarity, extends, the, definition, of, insurgency, to, situations, where, there, is, no, recognized, authority, as, in, the, somali, civil, war, especially, the, period, from, 1998, to, 2006, where, it, broke, into, quasi, autonomous, smaller, states, fighting, among, one, another, in, changing, alliances, james, fearon, and, david, laitin, define, insurgency, as, a, technology, of, military, conflict, characterized, by, small, lightly, armed, bands, practicing, guerrilla, warfare, from, rural, base, areas, austin, long, defines, insurgency, as, the, use, of, political, and, military, means, by, irregular, forces, to, change, an, existing, political, order, these, forces, typically, mingle, with, civilians, in, order, to, hide, from, the, forces, defending, the, political, order, according, to, matthew, adam, kocher, thomas, pepinsky, and, stathis, kalyvas, a, central, objective, in, insurgencies, is, to, achieve, control, over, civilians, to, exercise, control, armed, groups, apply, a, variety, of, practices, including, different, types, of, violence, dispute, resolution, taxation, regulation, of, movement, access, to, aid, and, services, and, social, strictures, according, to, james, d, fearon, wars, have, a, rationalist, explanation, behind, them, which, explains, why, leaders, prefer, to, gamble, in, wars, and, avoid, peaceful, bargains, fearon, states, that, intermediate, bargains, can, be, a, problem, because, countries, cannot, easily, trade, territories, with, the, spread, of, nationalism, furthermore, wars, can, take, the, form, of, civil, wars, in, her, article, why, bad, governance, leads, to, civil, wars, barbara, f, walter, has, presented, a, theory, that, explains, the, role, of, strong, institutions, in, preventing, insurgencies, that, can, result, in, civil, wars, walter, believes, that, institutions, can, contribute, to, four, goals, institutions, are, responsible, for, checking, the, government, creating, multiple, peaceful, routes, to, help, the, government, solve, problems, making, the, government, committed, to, political, terms, that, entails, preserving, peace, and, creating, an, atmosphere, where, rebels, do, not, need, to, form, militias, furthermore, walter, adds, that, if, there, is, a, conflict, between, the, government, and, the, insurgents, in, the, form, of, a, civil, war, that, can, bring, about, a, new, government, that, is, accountable, to, a, wider, range, of, people, who, have, to, commit, to, a, compromise, in, political, bargains, according, to, walter, the, presence, of, strong, influential, institutions, can, be, beneficial, to, prevent, the, repetition, of, civil, wars, but, autocratic, governments, are, less, likely, to, accept, the, emergence, of, strong, institutions, because, of, their, resulting, constraint, of, governmental, corruption, and, privileges, in, her, book, insurgent, collective, action, and, civil, war, in, salvador, elisabeth, jean, wood, explains, that, participants, in, high, risk, activism, are, very, aware, of, the, costs, and, benefits, of, engaging, in, civil, wars, wood, suggests, that, participants, in, the, 1964, freedom, summer, campaign, in, the, us, south, ran, high, risks, of, bodily, harm, in, challenging, the, long, standing, practices, of, racial, exclusion, in, mississippi, there, are, many, selective, incentives, that, encourage, insurgency, and, violent, movements, against, autocratic, political, regimes, for, example, the, supply, of, safety, as, a, material, good, can, be, provided, by, the, insurgents, which, abolishes, the, exploitation, of, the, government, and, thus, forms, one, of, the, main, incentives, the, revolutionary, power, can, help, manifest, a, social, political, network, that, in, return, provides, access, to, political, opportunities, to, diverse, candidates, who, share, a, collective, identity, and, cultural, homogeneity, also, civil, wars, and, insurgencies, can, provide, employment, and, access, to, services, and, resources, that, were, once, taken, over, by, the, autocratic, regimes, insurgencies, differ, in, their, use, of, tactics, and, methods, in, a, 2004, article, robert, r, tomes, spoke, of, four, elements, that, typically, encompass, an, insurgency, tomes, is, an, example, of, a, definition, that, does, not, cover, all, insurgencies, for, example, the, french, revolution, had, no, cell, system, and, in, the, american, revolution, little, to, no, attempt, was, made, to, terrorize, civilians, in, consecutive, coups, in, 1977, and, 1999, in, pakistan, the, initial, actions, focused, internally, on, the, government, rather, than, on, seeking, broad, support, while, tomes, definition, fits, well, with, mao, s, phase, i, it, does, not, deal, well, with, larger, civil, wars, mao, does, assume, terrorism, is, usually, part, of, the, early, phases, but, it, is, not, always, present, in, revolutionary, insurgency, tomes, offers, an, indirect, definition, of, insurgency, drawn, from, trinquier, s, definition, of, counterinsurgency, an, interlocking, system, of, actions, political, economic, psychological, military, that, aims, at, the, overthrow, of, the, established, authority, in, a, country, and, its, replacement, by, another, regime, steven, metz, observes, that, past, models, of, insurgency, do, not, perfectly, fit, modern, insurgency, in, that, current, instances, are, far, more, likely, to, have, a, multinational, or, transnational, character, than, those, of, the, past, several, insurgencies, may, belong, to, more, complex, conflicts, involving, third, forces, armed, groups, which, affect, the, outcome, such, as, militias, and, fourth, forces, unarmed, groups, which, affect, the, outcome, such, as, international, media, who, may, be, distinct, from, the, core, insurgents, and, the, recognized, government, while, overt, state, sponsorship, becomes, less, common, sponsorship, by, transnational, groups, is, more, common, the, nesting, of, insurgency, within, complex, conflicts, associated, with, state, weakness, or, failure, see, the, discussion, of, failed, states, below, metz, suggests, that, contemporary, insurgencies, have, far, more, complex, and, shifting, participation, than, traditional, wars, where, discrete, belligerents, seek, a, clear, strategic, victory, many, insurgencies, include, terrorism, while, there, is, no, accepted, definition, of, terrorism, in, international, law, united, nations, sponsored, working, definitions, include, one, drafted, by, alex, p, schmid, for, the, policy, working, group, on, the, united, nations, and, terrorism, reporting, to, the, secretary, general, in, 2002, the, working, group, stated, the, following, without, attempting, a, comprehensive, definition, of, terrorism, it, would, be, useful, to, delineate, some, broad, characteristics, of, the, phenomenon, terrorism, is, in, most, cases, essentially, a, political, act, it, is, meant, to, inflict, dramatic, and, deadly, injury, on, civilians, and, to, create, an, atmosphere, of, fear, generally, for, a, political, or, ideological, whether, secular, or, religious, purpose, terrorism, is, a, criminal, act, but, it, is, more, than, mere, criminality, to, overcome, the, problem, of, terrorism, it, is, necessary, to, understand, its, political, nature, as, well, as, its, basic, criminality, and, psychology, the, united, nations, needs, to, address, both, sides, of, this, equation, yet, another, conflict, of, definitions, involves, insurgency, versus, terrorism, the, winning, essay, of, the, 24th, annual, united, states, chairman, of, the, joint, chiefs, of, staff, strategic, essay, contest, by, michael, f, morris, said, may, pursue, political, even, revolutionary, goals, but, their, violence, replaces, rather, than, complements, a, political, program, morris, made, the, point, that, the, use, or, non, use, of, terrorism, does, not, define, insurgency, but, that, organizational, traits, have, traditionally, provided, another, means, to, tell, the, two, apart, insurgencies, normally, field, fighting, forces, orders, of, magnitude, larger, than, those, of, terrorist, organizations, insurgencies, have, a, political, purpose, and, may, provide, social, services, and, have, an, overt, even, legal, political, wing, their, covert, wing, carries, out, attacks, on, military, forces, with, tactics, such, as, raids, and, ambushes, as, well, as, acts, of, terror, such, as, attacks, that, cause, deliberate, civilian, casualties, mao, considered, terrorism, a, basic, part, of, his, first, part, of, the, three, phases, of, revolutionary, warfare, several, insurgency, models, recognize, that, completed, acts, of, terrorism, widen, the, security, gap, the, marxist, guerrilla, theoretician, carlos, marighella, specifically, recommended, acts, of, terror, as, a, means, of, accomplishing, something, that, fits, the, concept, of, opening, the, security, gap, mao, considered, terrorism, to, be, part, of, forming, a, guerrilla, movement, while, not, every, insurgency, involves, terror, most, involve, an, equally, hard, to, define, tactic, subversion, when, a, country, is, being, subverted, it, is, not, being, outfought, it, is, being, out, administered, subversion, is, literally, administration, with, a, minus, sign, in, front, the, exceptional, cases, of, insurgency, without, subversion, are, those, where, there, is, no, accepted, government, that, is, providing, administrative, services, while, the, term, subversion, is, less, commonly, used, by, current, u, s, spokesmen, that, may, be, due, to, the, hyperbolic, way, it, was, used, in, the, past, in, a, specifically, anticommunist, context, u, s, secretary, of, state, dean, rusk, did, in, april, 1962, when, he, declared, that, urgent, action, was, required, before, the, enemy, s, subversive, politico, military, teams, find, fertile, spawning, grounds, for, their, fish, eggs, in, a, western, context, rosenau, cites, a, british, secret, intelligence, service, definition, as, a, generalized, intention, to, emphasis, added, overthrow, or, undermine, parliamentary, democracy, by, political, industrial, or, violent, means, while, insurgents, do, not, necessarily, use, terror, it, is, hard, to, imagine, any, insurgency, meeting, its, goals, without, undermining, aspects, of, the, legitimacy, or, power, of, the, government, or, faction, it, opposes, rosenau, mentions, a, more, recent, definition, that, suggests, subversion, includes, measures, short, of, violence, which, still, serve, the, purposes, of, insurgents, rarely, subversion, alone, can, change, a, government, this, arguably, happened, in, the, liberalization, of, eastern, europe, to, the, communist, government, of, poland, solidarity, appeared, subversive, but, not, violent, in, arguing, against, the, term, global, war, on, terror, francis, fukuyama, said, the, united, states, was, not, fighting, terrorism, generically, as, in, chechnya, or, palestine, rather, he, said, the, slogan, war, on, terror, is, directed, at, radical, islamism, a, movement, that, makes, use, of, culture, for, political, objectives, he, suggested, it, might, be, deeper, than, the, ideological, conflict, of, the, cold, war, but, it, should, not, be, confused, with, samuel, huntington, s, clash, of, civilizations, addressing, huntington, s, thesis, fukuyama, stressed, that, the, us, and, its, allies, need, to, focus, on, specific, radical, groups, rather, than, clash, with, global, islam, fukuyama, argued, that, political, means, rather, than, direct, military, measures, are, the, most, effective, ways, to, defeat, that, insurgency, david, kilcullen, wrote, we, must, distinguish, al, qa, eda, and, the, broader, militant, movements, it, symbolises, entities, that, use, terrorism, from, the, tactic, of, terrorism, itself, there, may, be, utility, in, examining, a, war, not, specifically, on, the, tactic, of, terror, but, in, co, ordination, among, multiple, national, or, regional, insurgencies, it, may, be, politically, infeasible, to, refer, to, a, conflict, as, an, insurgency, rather, than, by, some, more, charged, term, but, military, analysts, when, concepts, associated, with, insurgency, fit, should, not, ignore, those, ideas, in, their, planning, additionally, the, recommendations, can, be, applied, to, the, strategic, campaign, even, if, it, is, politically, unfeasible, to, use, precise, terminology, insurgent, groups, often, struggle, to, maintain, coherency, and, authority, due, to, their, decentralized, nature, and, thus, rely, heavily, upon, ethnic, religious, or, ideological, bounds, to, avoid, splintering, while, it, may, be, reasonable, to, consider, transnational, insurgency, anthony, cordesman, points, out, some, of, the, myths, in, trying, to, have, a, worldwide, view, of, terror, social, scientists, soldiers, and, sources, of, change, have, been, modeling, insurgency, for, nearly, a, century, if, one, starts, with, mao, counterinsurgency, models, not, mutually, exclusive, from, one, another, come, from, kilcullen, mccormick, barnett, and, eizenstat, kilcullen, describes, the, pillars, of, a, stable, society, while, eizenstat, addresses, the, gaps, that, form, cracks, in, societal, stability, mccormick, s, model, shows, the, interplay, among, the, actors, insurgents, government, population, and, external, organizations, barnett, discusses, the, relationship, of, the, country, with, the, outside, world, and, cordesman, focuses, on, the, specifics, of, providing, security, recent, studies, have, tried, to, model, the, conceptual, architecture, of, insurgent, warfare, using, computational, and, mathematical, modelling, a, recent, study, by, juan, camilo, bohorquez, sean, gourley, alexander, r, dixon, michael, spagat, and, neil, f, johnson, entitled, common, ecology, quantifies, human, insurgency, suggests, a, common, structure, for, 9, contemporary, insurgent, wars, supported, on, statistical, data, of, more, than, 50, 000, insurgent, attacks, the, model, explains, the, recurrent, statistical, pattern, found, in, the, distribution, of, deaths, in, insurgent, and, terrorist, events, kilcullen, describes, a, framework, for, counterinsurgency, he, gives, a, visual, overview, of, the, actors, in, his, model, of, conflicts, which, he, represents, as, a, box, containing, an, ecosystem, defined, by, geographic, ethnic, economic, social, cultural, and, religious, characteristics, inside, the, box, are, among, others, governments, counterinsurgent, forces, insurgent, leaders, insurgent, forces, and, the, general, population, which, is, made, up, of, three, groups, often, but, not, always, states, or, groups, that, aid, one, side, or, the, other, are, outside, the, box, outside, the, box, intervention, has, dynamics, of, its, own, the, counterinsurgency, strategy, can, be, described, as, efforts, to, end, the, insurgency, by, a, campaign, developed, in, balance, along, three, pillars, security, political, and, economical, obviously, enough, you, cannot, command, what, you, do, not, control, therefore, unity, of, command, between, agencies, or, among, government, and, non, government, actors, means, little, in, this, environment, unity, of, command, is, one, of, the, axioms, of, military, doctrine, that, change, with, the, use, of, swarming, in, edwards, swarming, model, as, in, kilcullen, s, mode, unity, of, command, becomes, unity, of, effort, at, best, and, collaboration, or, deconfliction, at, least, as, in, swarming, in, kilcullen, s, view, unity, of, effort, depends, less, on, a, shared, command, and, control, hierarchy, and, more, on, a, shared, diagnosis, of, the, problem, i, e, the, distributed, knowledge, of, swarms, platforms, for, collaboration, information, sharing, and, deconfliction, each, player, must, understand, the, others, strengths, weaknesses, capabilities, and, objectives, and, inter, agency, teams, must, be, structured, for, versatility, the, ability, to, perform, a, wide, variety, of, tasks, and, agility, the, ability, to, transition, rapidly, and, smoothly, between, tasks, insurgencies, according, to, stuart, eizenstat, grow, out, of, gaps, to, be, viable, a, state, must, be, able, to, close, three, gaps, of, which, the, first, is, most, important, note, the, similarity, between, eizenstat, s, gaps, and, kilcullen, s, three, pillars, in, the, table, below, do, not, assume, that, a, problematic, state, is, unable, to, assist, less, developed, states, while, closing, its, own, gaps, mccormick, s, model, is, designed, as, a, tool, for, counterinsurgency, coin, but, develops, a, symmetrical, view, of, the, required, actions, for, both, the, insurgent, and, coin, forces, to, achieve, success, in, this, way, the, counterinsurgency, model, can, demonstrate, how, both, the, insurgent, and, coin, forces, succeed, or, fail, the, model, s, strategies, and, principle, apply, to, both, forces, therefore, the, degree, the, forces, follow, the, model, should, have, a, direct, correlation, to, the, success, or, failure, of, either, the, insurgent, or, coin, force, the, model, depicts, four, key, elements, or, players, all, of, these, interact, and, the, different, elements, have, to, assess, their, best, options, in, a, set, of, actions, in, thomas, barnett, s, paradigm, the, world, is, divided, into, a, connected, core, of, nations, enjoying, a, high, level, of, communications, among, their, organizations, and, individuals, and, those, nations, that, are, disconnected, internally, and, externally, in, a, reasonably, peaceful, situation, he, describes, a, system, administrator, force, often, multinational, which, does, what, some, call, nation, building, but, most, importantly, connects, the, nation, to, the, core, and, empowers, the, natives, to, communicate, that, communication, can, be, likened, to, swarm, coordination, if, the, state, is, occupied, or, in, civil, war, another, paradigm, comes, into, play, the, leviathan, a, first, world, military, force, that, takes, down, the, opposition, regular, forces, leviathan, is, not, constituted, to, fight, local, insurgencies, but, major, forces, leviathan, may, use, extensive, swarming, at, the, tactical, level, but, its, dispatch, is, a, strategic, decision, that, may, be, made, unilaterally, or, by, an, established, group, of, the, core, such, as, nato, or, asean, other, than, brief, leviathan, takedowns, security, building, appears, to, need, to, be, regional, with, logistical, and, other, technical, support, from, more, developed, countries, and, alliances, e, g, asean, nato, noncombat, military, assistance, in, closing, the, security, gap, begins, with, training, sometimes, in, specialized, areas, such, as, intelligence, more, direct, but, still, noncombat, support, includes, intelligence, planning, logistics, and, communications, anthony, cordesman, notes, that, security, requirements, differ, by, region, and, state, in, region, writing, on, the, middle, east, he, identified, different, security, needs, for, specific, areas, as, well, as, the, us, interest, in, security, in, those, areas, it, is, well, to, understand, that, counterterrorism, as, used, by, cordesman, does, not, mean, using, terrorism, against, the, terrorism, but, an, entire, spectrum, of, activities, nonviolent, and, violent, to, disrupt, an, opposing, terrorist, organization, the, french, general, joseph, gallieni, observed, while, a, colonial, administrator, in, 1898, a, country, is, not, conquered, and, pacified, when, a, military, operation, has, decimated, its, inhabitants, and, made, all, heads, bow, in, terror, the, ferments, of, revolt, will, germinate, in, the, mass, and, the, rancours, accumulated, by, the, brutal, action, of, force, will, make, them, grow, again, both, kilcullen, and, eizenstat, define, a, more, abstract, goal, than, does, cordesman, kilcullen, s, security, pillar, is, roughly, equivalent, to, eizenstat, s, security, gap, this, pillar, most, engages, military, commanders, attention, but, of, course, military, means, are, applied, across, the, model, not, just, in, the, security, domain, while, civilian, activity, is, critically, important, in, the, security, pillar, also, all, three, pillars, must, develop, in, parallel, and, stay, in, balance, while, being, firmly, based, in, an, effective, information, campaign, anthony, cordesman, while, speaking, of, the, specific, situation, in, iraq, makes, some, points, that, can, be, generalized, to, other, nations, in, turmoil, cordesman, recognizes, some, value, in, the, groupings, in, samuel, p, huntington, s, idea, of, the, clash, of, civilizations, but, rather, assuming, the, civilizations, must, clash, these, civilizations, simply, can, be, recognized, as, actors, in, a, multinational, world, in, the, case, of, iraq, cordesman, observes, that, the, burden, is, on, the, islamic, civilization, not, unilaterally, the, west, if, for, no, other, reason, that, the, civilization, to, which, the, problematic, nation, belongs, will, have, cultural, and, linguistic, context, that, western, civilization, cannot, hope, to, equal, the, heart, of, strengthening, weak, nations, must, come, from, within, and, that, heart, will, fail, if, they, deny, that, the, real, issue, is, the, future, of, their, civilization, if, they, tolerate, religious, cultural, or, separatist, violence, and, terrorism, when, it, strikes, at, unpopular, targets, or, if, they, continue, to, try, to, export, the, blame, for, their, own, failures, to, other, nations, religions, and, cultures, asymmetric, conflicts, or, irregular, conflicts, as, the, emerging, type, of, insurgencies, in, recent, history, is, described, by, berman, and, matanock, in, their, review, as, conflicts, where, the, government, forces, have, a, clear, advantage, over, rebels, in, coercive, capacity, in, this, kind, of, conflicts, rebel, groups, can, reintegrate, into, the, civilian, population, after, an, attack, if, the, civilians, are, willing, to, silently, accept, them, some, of, the, most, recent, examples, include, the, conflicts, in, afghanistan, and, iraq, as, the, european, countries, intervenes, in, the, conflicts, creating, asymmetry, between, the, government, forces, and, rebels, asymmetric, conflict, is, the, most, common, form, of, subnational, conflicts, and, the, most, civil, conflicts, where, the, western, countries, are, likely, to, be, involved, such, interventions, and, their, impacts, can, be, seen, in, the, nato, operation, in, libya, in, 2011, and, the, french, led, intervention, in, mali, in, 2013, berman, and, matanock, suggested, an, information, centric, framework, to, describe, asymmetric, conflicts, on, a, local, level, three, parties, are, involved, in, framework, government, forces, rebels, and, civilians, government, forces, and, rebels, attack, each, other, and, may, inadvertently, harm, civilians, whereas, civilians, can, anonymously, share, local, information, with, government, forces, which, would, allow, government, forces, to, effectively, use, their, asymmetric, advantage, to, target, rebels, taking, the, role, of, civilians, in, this, framework, into, consideration, the, government, and, rebels, will, divert, resources, to, provide, services, to, civilians, so, as, to, influence, their, decision, about, sharing, information, with, the, government, the, framework, is, based, on, several, assumptions, this, framework, leads, to, five, major, implications, for, counterinsurgency, strategies, these, implications, are, tested, by, empirical, evidences, from, conflicts, in, afghanistan, iraq, and, several, other, subnational, conflicts, further, research, on, governance, rule, of, law, attitudes, dynamics, and, agency, between, allies, are, needed, to, better, understand, asymmetric, conflicts, and, to, have, better, informed, decisions, made, at, the, tactical, strategic, and, public, policy, levels, before, one, counters, an, insurgency, one, must, understand, what, one, is, countering, typically, the, most, successful, counter, insurgencies, have, been, the, british, in, the, malay, emergency, and, the, filipino, government, s, countering, of, the, huk, rebellion, in, the, philippine, american, war, u, s, forces, successfully, quelled, the, filipino, insurgents, by, 1902, albeit, with, tactics, considered, unacceptable, by, the, majority, of, modern, populations, national, doctrines, case, studies
