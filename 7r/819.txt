warism, the, rejection, of, all, forms, of, warfare, teichman, s, beliefs, have, been, summarized, by, brian, orend, as, a, pacifist, rejects, war, and, believes, there, are, no, moral, grounds, which, can, justify, resorting, to, war, war, for, the, pacifist, is, always, wrong, in, a, sense, the, philosophy, is, based, on, the, idea, that, the, ends, do, not, justify, the, means, the, word, pacific, denotes, conciliatory, pacifism, may, be, based, on, moral, principles, a, deontological, view, or, pragmatism, a, consequentialist, view, principled, pacifism, holds, that, at, some, point, along, the, spectrum, from, war, to, interpersonal, physical, violence, such, violence, becomes, morally, wrong, pragmatic, pacifism, holds, that, the, costs, of, war, and, interpersonal, violence, are, so, substantial, that, better, ways, of, resolving, disputes, must, be, found, some, pacifists, follow, principles, of, nonviolence, believing, that, nonviolent, action, is, morally, superior, and, or, most, effective, some, however, support, physical, violence, for, emergency, defence, of, self, or, others, others, support, destruction, of, property, in, such, emergencies, or, for,

and, participants, in, such, movements, while, recognizing, the, importance, of, using, non, violent, methods, in, particular, circumstances, have, not, been, absolute, pacifists, sometimes, as, with, the, civil, rights, movement, s, march, from, selma, to, montgomery, in, 1965, they, have, called, for, armed, protection, the, interconnections, between, civil, resistance, and, factors, of, force, are, numerous, and, complex, an, absolute, pacifist, is, generally, described, by, the, bbc, as, one, who, believes, that, human, life, is, so, valuable, that, a, human, should, never, be, killed, and, war, should, never, be, conducted, even, in, self, defense, except, for, non, violence, type, the, principle, is, described, as, difficult, to, abide, by, consistently, due, to, violence, not, being, available, as, a, tool, to, aid, a, person, who, is, being, harmed, or, killed, it, is, further, claimed, that, such, a, pacifist, could, logically, argue, that, violence, leads, to, more, undesirable, results, than, non, violence, tapping, into, just, war, theory, conditional, pacifism, represents, a, spectrum, of, positions, departing, from, positions, of, absolute, pacifism, one, such, conditional, pacifism, is, the, common, pacificism, which, may, allow, defense, but, is, not, advocating, a, default, defensivism, or, even, interventionism, although, all, pacifists, are, opposed, to, war, between, nation, states, there, have, been, occasions, where, pacifists, have, supported, military, conflict, in, the, case, of, civil, war, or, revolution, for, instance, during, the, american, civil, war, both, the, american, peace, society, and, some, former, members, of, the, non, resistance, society, supported, the, union, s, military, campaign, arguing, they, were, carrying, out, a, police, action, against, the, confederacy, whose, act, of, secession, they, regarded, as, criminal, following, the, outbreak, of, the, spanish, civil, war, french, pacifist, ren, g, rin, urged, support, for, the, spanish, republic, g, rin, argued, that, the, spanish, nationalists, were, comparable, to, an, individual, enemy, and, the, republic, s, war, effort, was, equivalent, to, the, action, of, a, domestic, police, force, suppressing, crime, in, the, 1960s, some, pacifists, associated, with, the, new, left, supported, wars, of, national, liberation, and, supported, groups, such, as, the, viet, cong, and, the, algerian, fln, arguing, peaceful, attempts, to, liberate, such, nations, were, no, longer, viable, and, war, was, thus, the, only, option, advocacy, of, pacifism, can, be, found, far, back, in, history, and, literature, during, the, warring, states, period, the, pacifist, mohist, school, opposed, aggressive, war, between, the, feudal, states, they, took, this, belief, into, action, by, using, their, famed, defensive, strategies, to, defend, smaller, states, from, invasion, from, larger, states, hoping, to, dissuade, feudal, lords, from, costly, warfare, the, seven, military, classics, of, ancient, china, view, warfare, negatively, and, as, a, last, resort, for, example, the, three, strategies, of, huang, shigong, says, as, for, the, military, it, is, not, an, auspicious, instrument, it, is, the, way, of, heaven, to, despise, it, and, the, wei, liaozi, writes, as, for, the, military, it, is, an, inauspicious, instrument, as, for, conflict, and, contention, it, runs, counter, to, virtue, the, taoist, scripture, classic, of, great, peace, taiping, jing, foretells, the, coming, age, of, great, peace, taiping, the, taiping, jing, advocates, a, world, full, of, peace, the, lemba, religion, of, southern, french, congo, along, with, its, symbolic, herb, is, named, for, pacifism, lemba, lemba, peace, peace, describes, the, action,

pacifism, by, order, of, their, ancestor, nunuku, whenua, this, enabled, the, moriori, to, preserve, what, limited, resources, they, had, in, their, harsh, climate, avoiding, waste, through, warfare, in, turn, this, led, to, their, almost, complete, annihilation, in, 1835, by, invading, ng, ti, mutunga, and, ng, ti, tama, m, ori, from, the, taranaki, region, of, the, north, island, of, new,

ancient, greece, pacifism, seems, not, to, have, existed, except, as, a, broad, moral, guideline, against, violence, between, individuals, no, philosophical, program, of, rejecting, violence, between, states, or, rejecting, all, forms, of, violence, seems, to, have, existed, aristophanes, in, his, play, lysistrata, creates, the, scenario, of, an, athenian, woman, s, anti, war, sex, strike, during, the, peloponnesian, war, of, 431, 404, bce, and, the, play, has, gained, an, international, reputation, for, its, anti, war, message, nevertheless, it, is, both, fictional, and, comical, and, though, it, offers, a, pragmatic, opposition, to, the, destructiveness, of, war, its, message, seems, to, stem, from, frustration, with, the, existing, conflict, then, in, its, twentieth, year, rather, than, from, a, philosophical, position, against, violence, or, war, equally, fictional, is, the, nonviolent, protest, of, hegetorides, of, thasos, euripides, also, expressed, strong, anti, war, ideas, in, his, work, especially, the, trojan, women, in, plato, s, republic, socrates, makes, the, pacifistic, argument, that, a, just, person, would, not, harm, anyone, in, plato, s, earlier, work, crito, socrates, asserts, that, it, is, not, moral, to, return, evil, with, further, evil, an, original, moral, conception, according, to, gregory, vlastos, that, undermines, all, justifications, for, war, and, violence, several, roman, writers, rejected, the, militarism, of, roman, society, and, gave, voice, to, anti, war, sentiments, including, propertius, tibullus, and, ovid, the, stoic, seneca, the, younger, criticised, warfare, in, his, book, naturales, quaestiones, c, 65, ce, maximilian, of, tebessa, was, a, christian, conscientious, objector, he, was, killed, for, refusing, to, be, conscripted, throughout, history, many, have, understood, jesus, of, nazareth, to, have, been, a, pacifist, drawing, on, his, sermon, on, the, mount, in, the, sermon, jesus, stated, that, one, should, not, resist, an, evildoer, and, promoted, his, turn, the, other, cheek, philosophy, if, anyone, strikes, you, on, the, right, cheek, turn, the, other, also, and, if, anyone, wants, to, sue, you, and, take, your, coat, give, your, cloak, as, well, love, your, enemies, do, good, to, those, who, hate, you, bless, those, who, curse, you, pray, for, those, who, abuse, you, the, new, testament, story, is, of, jesus, besides, preaching, these, words, surrendering, himself, freely, to, an, enemy, intent, on, having, him, killed, and, proscribing, his, followers, from, defending, him, there, are, those, however, who, deny, that, jesus, was, a, pacifist, and, state, that, jesus, never, said, not, to, fight, citing, examples, from, the, new, testament, one, such, instance, portrays, an, angry, jesus, driving, dishonest, market, traders, from, the, temple, a, frequently, quoted, passage, is, luke, 22, 36, he, said, to, them, but, now, the, one, who, has, a, purse, must, take, it, and, likewise, a, bag, and, the, one, who, has, no, sword, must, sell, his, cloak, and, buy, one, pacifists, have, typically, explained, that, verse, as, jesus, fulfilling, prophecy, since, in, the, next, verse, jesus, continues, to, say, it, is, written, and, he, was, numbered, with, the, transgressors, and, i, tell, you, that, this, must, be, fulfilled, in, me, yes, what, is, written, about, me, is, reaching, its, fulfillment, others, have, interpreted, the, non, pacifist, statements, in, the, new, testament, to, be, related, to, self, defense, or, to, be, metaphorical, and, state, that, on, no, occasion, did, jesus, shed, blood, or, urge, others, to, shed, blood, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, the, protestant, reformation, gave, rise, to, a, variety, of, new, christian, sects, including, the, historic, peace, churches, foremost, among, them, were, the, religious, society, of, friends, quakers, amish, mennonites, hutterites, and, church, of, the, brethren, the, humanist, writer, desiderius, erasmus, was, one, of, the, most, outspoken, pacifists, of, the, renaissance, arguing, strongly, against, warfare, in, his, essays, the, praise, of, folly, 1509, and, the, complaint, of, peace, 1517, the, quakers, were, prominent, advocates, of, pacifism, who, as, early, as, 1660, had, repudiated, violence, in, all, forms, and, adhered, to, a, strictly, pacifist, interpretation, of, christianity, they, stated, their, beliefs, in, a, declaration, to, king, charles, ii, we, utterly, deny, all, outward, wars, and, strife, and, fightings, with, outward, weapons, for, any, end, or, under, any, pretense, whatever, this, is, our, testimony, to, the, whole, world, the, spirit, of, christ, which, leads, us, into, all, truth, will, never, move, us, to, fight, and, war, against, any, man, with, outward, weapons, neither, for, the, kingdom, of, christ, nor, for, the, kingdoms, of, this, world, throughout, the, many, 18th, century, wars, in, which, great, britain, participated, the, quakers, maintained, a, principled, commitment, not, to, serve, in, the, army, and, militia, or, even, to, pay, the, alternative, 10, fine, the, english, quaker, william, penn, who, founded, the, province, of, pennsylvania, employed, an, anti, militarist, public, policy, unlike, residents, of, many, of, the, colonies, quakers, chose, to, trade, peacefully, with, the, native, americans, including, for, land, the, colonial, province, was, for, the, 75, years, from, 1681, to, 1756, essentially, unarmed, and, experienced, little, or, no, warfare, in, that, period, from, the, 16th, to, the, 18th, centuries, a, number, of, thinkers, devised, plans, for, an, international, organisation, that, would, promote, peace, and, reduce, or, even, eliminate, the, occurrence, of, war, these, included, the, french, politician, duc, de, sully, the, philosophers, meric, cruc, and, the, abbe, de, saint, pierre, and, the, english, quakers, william, penn, and, john, bellers, pacifist, ideals, emerged, from, two, strands, of, thought, that, coalesced, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, one, rooted, in, the, secular, enlightenment, promoted, peace, as, the, rational, antidote, to, the, world, s, ills, while, the, other, was, a, part, of, the, evangelical, religious, revival, that, had, played, an, important, part, in, the, campaign, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, representatives, of, the, former, included, jean, jacques, rousseau, in, extrait, du, projet, de, paix, perpetuelle, de, monsieur, l, abbe, saint, pierre, 1756, immanuel, kant, in, his, thoughts, on, perpetual, peace, and, jeremy, bentham, who, proposed, the, formation, of, a, peace, association, in, 1789, representative, of, the, latter, was, william, wilberforce, who, thought, that, strict, limits, should, be, imposed, on, british, involvement, in, the, french, revolutionary, wars, based, on, christian, ideals, of, peace, and, brotherhood, bohemian, bernard, bolzano, taught, about, the, social, waste, of, militarism, and, the, needlessness, of, war, he, urged, a, total, reform, of, the, educational, social, and, economic, systems, that, would, direct, the, nation, s, interests, toward, peace, rather, than, toward, armed, conflict, between, nations, during, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, pacifism, was, not, entirely, frowned, upon, throughout, europe, it, was, considered, a, political, stance, against, costly, capitalist, imperialist, wars, a, notion, particularly, popular, in, the, british, liberal, party, of, the, twentieth, century, however, during, the, eras, of, world, war, one, and, especially, world, war, two, public, opinion, on, the, ideology, split, those, against, the, second, world, war, some, argued, were, not, fighting, against, unnecessary, wars, of, imperialism, but, instead, acquiescing, to, the, fascists, of, germany, italy, and, japan, during, the, period, of, the, napoleonic, wars, although, no, formal, peace, movement, was, established, until, the, end, of, hostilities, a, significant, peace, movement, animated, by, universalist, ideals, did, emerge, due, to, the, perception, of, britain, fighting, in, a, reactionary, role, and, the, increasingly, visible, impact, of, the, war, on, the, welfare, of, the, nation, in, the, form, of, higher, taxation, levels, and, high, casualty, rates, sixteen, peace, petitions, to, parliament,

peaceable, arbitration, in, the, affairs, of, nations, and, the, creation, of, an, international, institution, to, achieve, that, richard, became, the, secretary, of, the, peace, society, in, 1850, on, a, full, time, basis, a, position, which, he, would, keep, for, the, next, 40, years, earning, himself, a, reputation, as, the, apostle, of, peace, he, helped, secure, one, of, the, earliest, victories, for, the, peace, movement, by, securing, a, commitment, from, the, great, powers, in, the, treaty, of, paris, 1856, at, the, end, of, the, crimean, war, in, favour, of, arbitration, on, the, european, continent, wracked, by, social, upheaval, the, first, peace, congress, was, held, in, brussels, in, 1848, followed, by, paris, a, year, later, after, experiencing, a, recession, in, support, due, to, the, resurgence, of, militarism, during, the, american, civil, war, and, crimean, war, the, movement, began, to, spread, across, europe, and, began, to, infiltrate, the, new,

disobedience, that, was, not, only, nonviolent, but, also, sought, to, change, the, heart, of, the, opponent, he, contrasted, this, with, duragraha, resistant, force, which, sought, only, to, change,

sufficient, to, defeat, those, of, any, non, member, the, ensuing, debate, among, prominent, internationalists, modified, holt, s, plan, to, align, it, more, closely, with, proposals, offered, in, great, britain, by, viscount, james, bryce, a, former, british, ambassador, to, the, united, states, these, and, other, initiatives, were, pivotal, in, the, change, in, attitudes, that, gave, birth,

attitude, toward, militarism, crashed, over, europe, particularly, in, nations, such, as, great, britain, where, many, questioned, its, involvement, in, the, war, after, world, war, i, s, official, end, in, 1918, peace, movements, across, the, continent, and, the, united, states, renewed, gradually, gaining, popularity, among, young, europeans, who, grew, up, in, the, shadow, of, europe, s, trauma, over, the, great, war, organizations, formed, in, this, period, included, the, war, resisters, international, the, women, s, international, league, for, peace, and, freedom, the, no, more, war, movement, the, service, civil, international, and, the, peace, pledge, union, ppu, the, league, of, nations, also, convened, several, disarmament, conferences, in, the, interbellum, period, such, as, the, geneva, conference, though, the, support, that, pacifist, policy, and, idealism, received, varied, across, european, nations, these, organizations, and, movements, attracted, tens, of, thousands, of, europeans, spanning, most, professions, including, scientists, artists, musicians, politicians, clerks, students, activists, and, thinkers, pacifism, and, revulsion, with, war, were, very, popular, sentiments, in, 1920s, britain, novels, and, poems, on, the, theme, of, the, futility, of, war, and, the, slaughter, of, the, youth, by, old, fools, were, published, including, death, of, a, hero, by, richard, aldington, erich, remarque, s, translated, all, quiet, on, the, western, front, and, beverley, nichols, s, expose, cry, havoc, a, debate, at, the, university, of, oxford, in, 1933, on, the, motion, one, must, fight, for, king, and, country, captured, the, changed, mood, when, the, motion, was, resoundingly, defeated, dick, sheppard, established, the, peace, pledge, union, in, 1934, which, totally, renounced, war, and, aggression, the, idea, of, collective, security, was, also, popular, instead, of, outright, pacifism, the, public, generally, exhibited, a, determination, to, stand, up, to, aggression, but, preferably, with, the, use, of, economic, sanctions, and, multilateral, negotiations, many, members, of, the, peace, pledge, union, later, joined, the, bruderhof, during, its, period, of, residence, in, the, cotswolds, where, englishmen, and, germans, many, of, whom, were, jewish, lived, side, by, side, despite, local, persecution, the, british, labour, party, had, a, strong, pacifist, wing, in, the, early, 1930s, and, between, 1931, and, 1935, it, was, led, by, george, lansbury, a, christian, pacifist, who, later, chaired, the, no, more, war, movement, and, was, president, of, the, ppu, the, 1933, annual, conference, resolved, unanimously, to, pledge, itself, to, take, no, part, in, war, researcher, richard, toye, writes, that, labour, s, official, position, however, although, based, on, the, aspiration, towards, a, world, socialist, commonwealth, and, the, outlawing, of, war, did, not, imply, a, renunciation, of, force, under, all, circumstances, but, rather, support, for, the, ill, defined, concept, of, collective, security, under, the, league, of, nations, at, the, same, time, on, the, party, s, left, stafford, cripps, s, small, but, vocal, socialist, league, opposed, the, official, policy, on, the, non, pacifist, ground, that, the, league, of, nations, was, nothing, but, the, tool, of, the, satiated, imperialist, powers, lansbury, was, eventually, persuaded, to, resign, as, labour, leader, by, the, non, pacifist, wing, of, the, party, and, was, replaced, by, clement, attlee, as, the, threat, from, nazi, germany, increased, in, the, 1930s, the, labour, party, abandoned, its, pacifist, position, and, supported, rearmament, largely, as, the, result, of, the, efforts, of, ernest, bevin, and, hugh, dalton, who, by, 1937, had, also, persuaded, the, party, to, oppose, neville, chamberlain, s, policy, of, appeasement, the, league, of, nations, attempted, to, play, its, role, in, ensuring, world, peace, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, however, with, the, increasingly, revisionist, and, aggressive, behaviour, of, nazi, germany, fascist, italy, and, imperial, japan, it, ultimately, failed, to, maintain, such, a, world, order, economic, sanctions, were, used, against, states, that, committed, aggression, such, as, those, against, italy, when, it, invaded, abyssinia, but, there, was, no, will, on, the, part, of, the, principal, league, powers, britain, and, france, to, subordinate, their, interests, to, a, multilateral, process, or, to, disarm, at, all, themselves, the, spanish, civil, war, proved, a, major, test, for, international, pacifism, and, the, work, of, pacifist, organisations, such, as, war, resisters, international, and, the, fellowship, of, reconciliation, and, individuals, such, as, jos, brocca, and, amparo, poch, in, that, arena, has, until, recently, been, ignored, or, forgotten, by, historians, overshadowed, by, the, memory, of, the, international, brigades, and, other, militaristic, interventions, shortly, after, the, war, ended, simone, weil, despite, having, volunteered, for, service, on, the, republican, side, went, on, to, publish, the, iliad, or, the, poem, of, force, a, work, that, has, been, described, as, a, pacifist, manifesto, in, response, to, the, threat, of, fascism, some, pacifist, thinkers, such, as, richard, b, gregg, devised, plans, for, a, campaign, of, nonviolent, resistance, in, the, event, of, a, fascist, invasion, or, takeover, as, the, prospect, of, a, second, major, war, began, to, seem, increasingly, inevitable, much, of, france, adopted, pacifist, views, though, some, historians, argue, that, france, felt, more, war, anxiety, than, a, moral, objection, to, a, second, war, hitler, s, spreading, influence, and, territory, posed, an, enormous, threat, to, french, livelihood, from, their, neighbors, the, french, countryside, had, been, devastated, during, world, war, i, and, the, entire, nation, was, reluctant, to, subject, its, territory, to, the, same, treatment, though, all, countries, in, the, first, world, war, had, suffered, great, losses, france, was, one, of, the, most, devastated, and, many, did, not, want, a, second, war, as, germany, dealt, with, the, burdens, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, a, conflict, arose, in, the, 1930s, between, german, christianity, and, german, nationalism, many, germans, found, the, terms, of, the, treaty, debilitating, and, humiliating, so, german, nationalism, offered, a, way, to, regain, the, country, s, pride, german, christianity, warned, against, the, risks, of, entering, a, war, similar, to, the, previous, one, as, the, german, depression, worsened, and, fascism, began, to, rise, in, germany, a, greater, tide, of, germans, began, to, sway, toward, hitler, s, brand, of, nationalism, that, would, come, to, crush, pacifism, with, the, start, of, world, war, ii, pacifist, and, antiwar, sentiment, declined, in, nations, affected, by, the, war, even, the, communist, controlled, american, peace, mobilization, reversed, its, antiwar, activism, once, germany, invaded, the, soviet, union, in, 1941, after, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, non, interventionist, america, first, committee, dropped, its, opposition, to, american, involvement, in, the, war, and, disbanded, but, many, smaller, religious, and, socialist, groups, continued, their, opposition, to, war, bertrand, russell, argued, that, the, necessity, of, defeating, adolf, hitler, and, the, nazis, was, a, unique, circumstance, in, which, war, was, not, the, worst, of, the, possible, evils, he, called, his, position, relative, pacifism, shortly, before, the, outbreak, of, war, british, writers, such, as, e, m, forster, leonard, woolf, david, garnett, and, storm, jameson, all, rejected, their, earlier, pacifism, and, endorsed, military, action, against, nazism, similarly, albert, einstein, wrote, i, loathe, all, armies, and, any, kind, of, violence, yet, i, m, firmly, convinced, that, at, present, these, hateful, weapons, offer, the, only, effective, protection, the, british, pacifists, reginald, sorensen, and, c, j, cadoux, while, bitterly, disappointed, by, the, outbreak, of, war, nevertheless, urged, their, fellow, pacifists, not, to, obstruct, the, war, effort, pacifists, across, great, britain, further, struggled, to, uphold, their, anti, military, values, during, the, blitz, a, coordinated, long, term, attack, by, the, luftwaffe, on, great, britain, as, the, country, was, ravaged, nightly, by, german, bombing, raids, pacifists, had, to, seriously, weigh, the, importance, of, their, political, and, moral, values, against, the, desire, to, protect, their, nation, some, scholars, theorize, that, pacifism, was, the, cause, of, france, s, rapid, fall, to, the, germans, after, it, was, invaded, by, the, nazis, in, june, 1940, resulting, in, a, takeover, of, the, government, by, the, german, military, whether, or, not, pacifism, weakened, french, defenses, against, the, germans, there, was, no, hope, of, sustaining, a, real, pacifist, movement, after, paris, fell, just, as, peaceful, germans, succumbed, to, violent, nationalism, the, pacifist, french, were, muzzled, by, the, totality, of, german, control, over, nearly, all, of, france, the, french, pacifists, andr, and, magda, trocm, helped, conceal, hundreds, of, jews, fleeing, the, nazis, in, the, village, of, le, chambon, sur, lignon, after, the, war, the, trocm, s, were, declared, righteous, among, the, nations, pacifists, in, nazi, germany, were, dealt, with, harshly, reducing, the, movement, into, almost, nonexistence, those, who, continued, to, advocate, for, the, end, of, the, war, and, violence, were, often, sent, to, labor, camps, german, pacifist, carl, von, ossietzky, and, olaf, kullmann, a, norwegian, pacifist, active, during, the, nazi, occupation, were, both, imprisoned, in, concentration, camps, and, died, as, a, result, of, their, mistreatment, there, austrian, farmer, franz, j, gerst, tter, was, executed, in, 1943, for, refusing, to, serve, in, the, wehrmacht, german, nationalism, consumed, even, the, most, peaceful, of, christians, who, may, have, believed, that, hitler, was, acting, in, the, good, faith, of, germany, or, who, may, have, been, so, suppressed, by, the, nazi, regime, that, they, were, content, to, act, as, bystanders, to, the, violence, occurring, around, them, dietrich, bonhoeffer, an, anti, nazi, german, pastor, who, later, died, in, 1945, in, the, flossenb, rg, concentration, camp, once, wrote, in, a, letter, to, his, grandmother, the, issue, really, is, germanism, or, christianity, after, the, end, of, the, war, it, was, discovered, that, the, black, book, or, sonderfahndungsliste, g, b, a, list, of, britons, to, be, arrested, in, the, event, of, a, successful, german, invasion, of, britain, included, three, active, pacifists, vera,

united, states, government, allowed, sincere, objectors, to, serve, in, noncombatant, military, roles, however, those, draft, resisters, who, refused, any, cooperation, with, the, war, effort, often, spent, much, of, the, wars, in, federal, prisons, during, world, war, ii, pacifist, leaders, such, as, dorothy, day, and, ammon, hennacy, of, the, catholic, worker, movement, urged, young, americans, not, to, enlist, in, military, service, during, the, two, world, wars, young, men, conscripted, into, the, military, but, who, refused, to, take, up, arms, were, called, conscientious, objectors, though, these, men, had, to, either, answer, their, conscription, or, face, prison, time, their, status, as, conscientious, objectors, permitted, them, to, refuse, to, take, part, in, battle, using, weapons, and, the, military, was, forced, to, find, a, different, use, for, them, often, these, men, were, assigned, various, tasks, close, to, battle, such, as, medical, duties, though, some, were, assigned, various, civilian, jobs, including, farming, forestry, hospital, work, and, mining, conscientious, objectors, were, often, viewed, by, soldiers, as, cowards, and, liars, and, they, were, sometimes, accused, of, shirking, military, duty, out, of, fear, rather, than, as, the, result, of, conscience, in, great, britain, during, world, war, ii, the, majority, of, the, public, did, not, approve, of, moral, objection, by, soldiers, but, supported, their, right, to, abstain, from, direct, combat, on, the, more, extreme, sides, of, public, opinion, were, those, who, fully, supported, the, objectors, and, those, who, believed, they, should, be, executed, as, traitors, the, world, war, ii, objectors, were, often, scorned, as, fascist, sympathizers, and, traitors, though, many, of,

endeavored, to, demonstrate, that, the, theoretical, principles, underlying, secular, pacifism, could, be, successfully, applied, in, order, to, resolve, several, unique, forms, of, international,

absolute, pacifists, are, anti, social, and, exalt, the, individual, over, society, which, could, lead, to, anarchy, instead, he, noted, that, the, bah, conception, of, social, life, follows, a,

that, buddhism, is, a, religion, based, solely, on, peace, however, like, all, religions, there, is, a, long, history, of, violence, in, various, buddhist, traditions, and, many, examples, of,

for, peace, and, peaceful, solutions, to, all, problems, however, most, muslims, are, generally, not, pacifists, as, the, teachings, in, the, qur, an, and, hadith, allow, for, wars, to, be, fought, if, they, are, justified, prior, to, the, hijra, travel, muhammad, struggled, non, violently, against, his, opposition, in, mecca, providing, a, basis, for, islamic, pacifist, schools, of, thought, such, as, some, sufi, orders, in, the, 13th, century, salim, suwari, a, philosopher, in, islam, came, up, with, a, peaceful, approach, to, islam, known, as, the, suwarian, tradition, the, earliest,

1929, whose, success, triggered, severe, crackdowns, by, the, colonial, government, against, khan, and, his, supporters, and, they, experienced, some, of, the, strongest, repression, of, the, indian, independence, movement, according, to, the, ahmadiyya, understanding, of, islam, pacifism, is, a, strong, current, and, jihad, is, one, s, personal, inner, struggle, and, should, not, be, used, violently, for, political, motives, violence, is, the, last, option, only, to, be, used, to, protect, religion, and, one, s, own, life, in, extreme, situations, of, persecution, mirza, ghulam, ahmad, the, founder, of, the, ahmadiyya, muslim, community, said, that, in, contrary, to, the, current, views, islam, does, not, allow, the, use, of, sword, in, religion, except, in, the, case, of, defensive, wars, wars, waged, to, punish, a, tyrant, or, those, meant, to, uphold, freedom, ahmadiyya, claims, its, objective, to, be, the, peaceful, propagation, of, islam, with, special, emphasis,

of, violent, jihad, unnecessary, in, modern, times, they, believe, that, the, answer, of, hate, should, be, given, by, love, many, muslims, consider, ahmadi, muslims, as, either, kafirs, or, heretics, an, animosity, sometimes, resulting, in, murder, absolute, non, violence, and, compassion, for, all, life, is, central, to, jainism, human, life, is, valued, as, a, unique, rare, opportunity, to, reach, enlightenment, killing, any, person, or, living, creature, seen, or, unseen, no, matter, what, crime, may, have, committed, is, considered, unimaginably, terrible, it, is, a, religion, that, requires, monks, from, all, its, sects, and, traditions, to, be, lacto, vegetarianism, most, or, all, jains, are, lacto, vegetarians, some, indian, regions, such, as, gujarat, madhya, pradesh, have, been, strongly, influenced, by, jains, and, often, the, majority, of, the, local, hindus, of, every, denomination, are, also, lacto, vegetarian, although, judaism, is, not, a, pacifist, religion, it, does, believe, that, peace, is, highly, desirable, most, jews, will, hope, to, limit, or, minimise, conflict, and, violence, but, they, accept, that, given, human, nature, and, the, situations, which, arise, from, time, to, time, in, the, world, there, will, be, occasions, when, violence, and, war, may, be, justified, the, jewish, peace, fellowship, is, a, new, york, based, nonprofit, nondenominational, organization, set, up, to, provide, a, jewish, voice, in, the, peace, movement, the, organization, was, founded, in, 1941, in, order, to, support, jewish, conscientious, objectors, who, sought, exemption, from, combatant, military, service, it, is, affiliated, to, the, international, fellowship, of, reconciliation, the, fringe, neturei, karta, group, of, anti, zionist, ultra, orthodox, jews, supposedly, take, a, pacifist, line, saying, that, jews, are, not, allowed, to, dominate, kill, harm, or, demean, another, people, and, are, not, allowed, to, have, anything, to, do, with, the, zionist, enterprise, their, political, meddling, and, their, wars, however, the, neturei, karta, group, do, support, groups, such, as, hezbollah, and, hamas, that, are, violent, towards, israel, the, hebrew, bible, has, many, examples, of, jews, being, told, to, go, and, war, against, enemy, lands, or, within, the, israelite, community, as, well, as, instances, where, god, as, destroyer, and, protector, goes, to, war, for, non, participant, jews, while, many, governments, have, tolerated, pacifist, views, and, even, accommodated, pacifists, refusal, to, fight, in, wars, others, at, times, have, outlawed, pacifist, and, anti, war, activity, in, 1918, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, sedition, act, of, 1918, during, the, periods, between, world, wars, i, and, world, war, ii, pacifist, literature, and, public, advocacy, was, banned, in, italy, under, benito, mussolini, germany, after, the, rise, of, adolf, hitler, spain, under, francisco, franco, and, the, soviet, union, under, joseph, stalin, in, these, nations, pacifism, was, denounced, as, cowardice, indeed, mussolini, referred, to, pacifist, writings, as, the, propaganda, of, cowardice, today, the, united, states, requires, that, all, young, men, register, for, selective, service, but, does, not, allow, them, to, be, classified, as, conscientious, objectors, unless, they, are, drafted, in, some, future, reinstatement, of, the, draft, allowing, them, to, be, discharged, or, transferred, to, noncombatant, status, some, european, governments, like, switzerland, greece, norway, and, germany, offer, civilian, service, however, even, during, periods, of, peace, many, pacifists, still, refuse, to, register, for, or, report, for, military, duty, risking, criminal, charges, anti, war, and, pacifist, political, parties, seeking, to, win, elections, may, moderate, their, demands, calling, for, de, escalation, or, major, arms, reduction, rather, than, the, outright, disarmament, which, is, advocated, by, many, pacifists, green, parties, list, non, violence, and, decentralization, towards, anarchist, co, operatives, or, minimalist, village, government, as, two, of, their, ten, key, values, however, in, power, greens, often, compromise, the, german, greens, in, the, cabinet, of, social, democrat, gerhard, schr, der, supported, an, intervention, by, german, troops, in, afghanistan, in, 2001, if, that, they, hosted, the, peace, conference, in, berlin, however, during, the, 2002, election, greens, forced, schr, der, to, swear, that, no, german, troops, would, invade, iraq, some, pacifists, and, multilateralists, are, in, favor, of, international, criminal, law, as, means, to, prevent, and, control, international, aggression, the, international, criminal, court, has, jurisdiction, over, war, crimes, but, the, crime, of, aggression, has, yet, to, be, clearly, defined, in, international, law, the, italian, constitution, enforces, a, mild, pacifist, character, on, the, italian, republic, as, article, 11, states, that, italy, repudiates, war, as, an, instrument, offending, the, liberty, of, the, peoples, and, as, a, means, for, settling, international, disputes, similarly, articles, 24, 25, and, 26, of, the, german, constitution, 1949, alinea, 15, of, the, french, constitution, 1946, article, 20, of, the, danish, constitution, 1953, article, 9, of, the, japanese, constitution, 1947, and, several, other, mostly, european, constitutions, correspond, to, the, united, nations, charter, by, rejecting, the, institution, of, war, in, favour, of, collective, security, and, peaceful, cooperation, however, some, pacifists, such, as, the, christian, anarchist, leo, tolstoy, and, autarchist, robert, lefevre, consider, the, state, a, form, of, warfare, in, addition, for, doctrinal, reason, that, a, manmade, government, is, inferior, to, divine, governance, and, law, many, pacifist, identified, religions, religious, sects, also, refrain, from, political, activity, altogether, including, the, anabaptists, jehovah, s, witnesses, and, mandaeans, this, means, that, such, groups, refuse, to, participate, in, government, office, or, serve, under, an, oath, to, a, government, anarcho, pacifism, is, a, form, of, anarchism, which, completely, rejects, the, use, of, violence, in, any, form, for, any, purpose, the, main, precedent, was, henry, david, thoreau, who, through, his, work, civil, disobedience, influenced, the, advocacy, of, both, leo, tolstoy, and, mahatma, gandhi, for, nonviolent, resistance, as, a, global, movement, anarcho, pacifism, emerged, shortly, before, world, war, ii, in, the, netherlands, great, britain, and, the, united, states, and, was, a, strong, presence, in, the, subsequent, campaigns, for, nuclear, disarmament, violence, has, always, been, controversial, in, anarchism, while, many, anarchists, during, the, 19th, century, embraced, propaganda, of, the, deed, leo, tolstoy, and, other, anarcho, pacifists, directly, opposed, violence, as, a, means, for, change, he, argued, that, anarchism, must, by, nature, be, nonviolent, since, it, is, by, definition, opposition, to, coercion, and, force, and, since, the, state, is, inherently, violent, meaningful, pacifism, must, likewise, be, anarchistic, his, philosophy, was, cited, as, a, major, inspiration, by, mahatma, gandhi, an, indian, independence, leader, and, pacifist, who, self, identified, as, an, anarchist, ferdinand, domela, nieuwenhuis, was, also, instrumental, in, establishing, the, pacifist, trend, within, the, anarchist, movement, in, france, anti, militarism, appeared, strongly, in, individualist, anarchist, circles, as, mile, armand, founded, ligue, antimilitariste, in, 1902, with, albert, libertad, and, george, mathias, paraf, javal, many, pacifists, who, would, be, conscientious, objectors, to, military, service, are, also, opposed, to, paying, taxes, to, fund, the, military, in, the, united, states, the, national, campaign, for, a, peace, tax, fund, works, to, pass, a, national, law, to, allow, conscientious, objectors, to, redirect, their, tax, money, to, be, used, only, for, non, military, purposes, one, common, argument, against, pacifism, is, the, possibility, of, using, violence, to, prevent, further, acts, of, violence, and, reduce, the, net, sum, of, violence, this, argument, hinges, on, consequentialism, an, otherwise, morally, objectionable, action, can, be, justified, if, it, results, in, a, positive, outcome, for, example, either, violent, rebellion, or, foreign, nations, sending, in, troops, to, end, a, dictator, s, violent, oppression, may, save, millions, of, lives, even, if, many, thousands, died, in, the, war, those, pacifists, who, base, their, beliefs, on, deontological, grounds, would, oppose, such, violent, action, others, would, oppose, organized, military, responses, but, support, individual, and, small, group, self, defense, against, specific, attacks, if, initiated, by, the, dictator, s, forces, pacifists, may, argue, that, military, action, could, be, justified, should, it, subsequently, advance, the, general, cause, of, peace, still, more, pacifists, would, argue, that, a, nonviolent, reaction, may, not, save, lives, immediately, but, would, in, the, long, run, the, acceptance, of, violence, for, any, reason, makes, it, easier, to, use, in, other, situations, learning, and, committing, to, pacifism, helps, to, send, a, message, that, violence, is, in, fact, not, the, most, effective, way, it, can, also, help, people, to, think, more, creatively, and, find, more, effective, ways, to, stop, violence, without, more, violence, in, light, of, the, common, criticism, of, pacifism, as, not, offering, a, clear, alternative, policy, one, approach, to, finding, more, effective, ways, has, been, the, attempt, to, develop, the, idea, of, defence, by, civil, resistance, also, called, social, defence, this, idea, which, is, not, necessarily, dependent, on, acceptance, of, pacifist, beliefs, is, based, on, relying, on, nonviolent, resistance, against, possible, threats, whether, external, such, as, invasion, or, internal, such, as, coup, d, tat, there, have, been, some, works, on, this, topic, including, by, adam, roberts, and, gene, sharp, however, no, country, has, adopted, this, approach, as, the, sole, basis, of, its, defence, for, further, information, and, sources, see, social, defence, axis, aggression, that, precipitated, world, war, ii, has, been, cited, as, an, argument, against, pacifism, if, these, forces, had, not, been, challenged, and, defeated, militarily, the, argument, goes, many, more, people, would, have, died, under, their, oppressive, rule, adolf, hitler, told, the, british, foreign, secretary, lord, halifax, in, 1937, that, the, british, should, shoot, gandhi, and, if, this, doesn, t, suffice, to, reduce, them, to, submission, shoot, a, dozen, leading, members, of, the, congress, and, if, that, doesn, t, suffice, shoot, 200, and, so, on, as, you, make, it, clear, that, you, mean, business, adolf, hitler, noted, in, his, second, book, later, the, attempt, to, adapt, the, living, space, to, increased, population, turned, into, unmotivated, wars, of, conquest, which, in, their, very, lack, of, motivation, contained, the, germ, of, the, subsequent, reaction, pacifism, is, the, answer, to, it, pacifism, has, existed, in, the, world, ever, since, there, have, been, wars, whose, meaning, no, longer, lay, in, the, conquest, of, territory, for, a, folk, s, sustenance, since, then, it, has, been, war, s, eternal, companion, it, will, again, disappear, as, soon, as, war, ceases, to, be, an, instrument, of, booty, hungry, or, power, hungry, individuals, or, nations, and, as, soon, as, it, again, becomes, the, ultimate, weapon, with, which, a, folk, fights, for, its, daily, bread, hermann, g, ring, described, during, an, interview, at, the, nuremberg, trials, how, denouncing, and, outlawing, pacifism, was, an, important, part, of, the, nazis, seizure, of, power, the, people, can, always, be, brought, to, the, bidding, of, the, leaders, that, is, easy, all, you, have, to, do, is, tell, them, they, are, being, attacked, and, denounce, the, pacifists, for, lack, of, patriotism, and, exposing, the, country, to, danger, it, works, the, same, way, in, any, country, some, commentators, on, the, most, nonviolent, forms, of, pacifism, including, jan, narveson, argue, that, such, pacifism, is, a, self, contradictory, doctrine, narveson, claims, that, everyone, has, rights, and, corresponding, responsibilities, not, to, violate, others, rights, since, pacifists, give, up, their, ability, to, protect, themselves, from, violation, of, their, right, not, to, be, harmed, then, other, people, thus, have, no, corresponding, responsibility, thus, creating, a, paradox, of, rights, narveson, said, that, the, prevention, of, infractions, of, that, right, is, precisely, what, one, has, a, right, to, when, one, has, a, right, at, all, narveson, then, discusses, how, rational, persuasion, is, a, good, but, often, inadequate, method, of, discouraging, an, aggressor, he, considers, that, everyone, has, the, right, to, use, any, means, necessary, to, prevent, deprivation, of, their, civil, liberties, and, force, could, be, necessary, peter, gelderloos, criticizes, the, idea, that, nonviolence, is, the, only, way, to, fight, for, a, better, world, according, to, gelderloos, pacifism, as, an, ideology, serves, the, interests, of, the, state, and, is, hopelessly, caught, up, psychologically, with, the, control, schema, of, patriarchy, and, white, supremacy
