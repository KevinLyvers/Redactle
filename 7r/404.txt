old, english, englis, or, nglisc, pronounced, or, anglo, saxon, was, the, earliest, recorded, form, of, the, english, language, spoken, in, england, and, southern, and, eastern, scotland, in, the, early, middle, ages, it, developed, from, the, languages, brought, to, great, britain, by, anglo, saxon, settlers, in, the, mid, 5th, century, and, the, first, old, english, literary, works, date, from, the, mid, 7th, century, after, the, norman, conquest, of, 1066, english, was, replaced, for, several, centuries, by, anglo, norman, a, type, of, french, as, the, language, of, the, upper, classes, this, is, regarded, as, marking, the, end, of, the, old, english, era, since, during, the, subsequent, period, the, english, language, was, heavily, influenced, by, anglo, norman, developing, into, what, is, now, known, as, middle, english, in, england, and, early, scots, in, scotland, old, english, developed, from, a, set, of, anglo, frisian, or, ingvaeonic, dialects, originally, spoken, by, germanic, tribes, traditionally, known, as, the, angles, saxons, and, jutes, as, the, germanic, settlers, became, dominant, in, england, their, language, replaced, the, languages, of, roman, britain, common, brittonic, a, celtic, language, and, latin, brought, to, britain, by, the, roman, conquest, old, english, had, four, main, dialects, associated, with, particular, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, kentish, mercian, northumbrian, and, west, saxon, it, was, west, saxon, that, formed, the, basis, for, the, literary, standard, of, the, later, old, english, period, although, the, dominant, forms, of, middle, and, modern, english, would, develop, mainly, from, mercian, and, scots, from, northumbrian, the, speech, of, eastern, and, northern, parts, of, england, was, subject, to, strong, old, norse, influence, due, to, scandinavian, rule, and, settlement, beginning, in, the, 9th, century, old, english, is, one, of, the, west, germanic, languages, and, its, closest, relatives, are, old, frisian, and, old, saxon, like, other, old, germanic, languages, it, is, very, different, from, modern, english, and, modern, scots, and, largely, incomprehensible, for, modern, english, or, modern, scots, speakers, without, study, within, old, english, grammar, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and, verbs, have, many, inflectional, endings, and, forms, and, word, order, is, much, freer, the, oldest, old, english, inscriptions, were, written, using, a, runic, system, but, from, about, the, 8th, century, this, was, replaced, by, a, version, of, the, latin, alphabet, englis, from, which, the, word, english, is, derived, means, pertaining, to, the, angles, the, angles, were, one, of, the, germanic, tribes, who, settled, in, many, parts, of, britain, in, the, 5th, century, by, the, 9th, century, all, speakers, of, old, english, including, those, who, claimed, saxon, or, jutish, ancestry, could, be, referred, to, as, englis, this, name, probably, either, derives, from, proto, germanic, anguz, which, referred, to, narrowness, constriction, or, anxiety, perhaps, referring, to, shallow, waters, near, the, coast, or, else, it, may, derive, from, a, related, word, ang, which, could, refer, to, curve, or, hook, shapes, including, fishing, hooks, concerning, the, second, option, it, has, been, hypothesised, that, the, angles, acquired, their, name, either, because, they, lived, on, a, curved, promontory, of, land, shaped, like, a, fishhook, or, else, because, they, were, fishermen, anglers, old, english, was, not, static, and, its, usage, covered, a, period, of, 700, years, from, the, anglo, saxon, settlement, of, britain, in, the, 5th, century, to, the, late, 11th, century, some, time, after, the, norman, invasion, while, indicating, that, the, establishment, of, dates, is, an, arbitrary, process, albert, baugh, dates, old, english, from, 450, to, 1150, a, period, of, full, inflections, a, synthetic, language, perhaps, around, 85, of, old, english, words, are, no, longer, in, use, but, those, that, survived, are, the, basic, elements, of, modern, english, vocabulary, old, english, is, a, west, germanic, language, and, developed, out, of, ingvaeonic, also, known, as, north, sea, germanic, dialects, from, the, 5th, century, it, came, to, be, spoken, over, most, of, the, territory, of, the, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, which, became, the, kingdom, of, england, this, included, most, of, present, day, england, as, well, as, part, of, what, is, now, southeastern, scotland, which, for, several, centuries, belonged, to, the, kingdom, of, northumbria, other, parts, of, the, island, continued, to, use, celtic, languages, gaelic, and, perhaps, some, pictish, in, most, of, scotland, medieval, cornish, all, over, cornwall, and, in, adjacent, parts, of, devon, cumbric, perhaps, to, the, 12th, century, in, parts, of, cumbria, and, welsh, in, wales, and, possibly, also, on, the, english, side, of, the, anglo, welsh, border, except, in, the, areas, of, scandinavian, settlements, where, old, norse, was, spoken, and, danish, law, applied, old, english, literacy, developed, after, christianisation, in, the, late, 7th, century, the, oldest, surviving, work, of, old, english, literature, is, c, dmon, s, hymn, which, was, composed, between, 658, and, 680, but, not, written, down, until, the, early, 8th, century, there, is, a, limited, corpus, of, runic, inscriptions, from, the, 5th, to, 7th, centuries, but, the, oldest, coherent, runic, texts, notably, the, inscriptions, on, the, franks, casket, date, to, the, early, 8th, century, the, old, english, latin, alphabet, was, introduced, around, the, 8th, century, with, the, unification, of, several, of, the, anglo, saxon, kingdoms, outside, the, danelaw, by, alfred, the, great, in, the, later, 9th, century, the, language, of, government, and, literature, became, standardised, around, the, west, saxon, dialect, early, west, saxon, alfred, advocated, education, in, english, alongside, latin, and, had, many, works, translated, into, the, english, language, some, of, them, such, as, pope, gregory, i, s, treatise, pastoral, care, appear, to, have, been, translated, by, alfred, himself, in, old, english, typical, of, the, development, of, literature, poetry, arose, before, prose, but, alfred, chiefly, inspired, the, growth, of, prose, a, later, literary, standard, dating, from, the, late, 10th, century, arose, under, the, influence, of, bishop, thelwold, of, winchester, and, was, followed, by, such, writers, as, the, prolific, lfric, of, eynsham, the, grammarian, this, form, of, the, language, is, known, as, the, winchester, standard, or, more, commonly, as, late, west, saxon, it, is, considered, to, represent, the, classical, form, of, old, english, it, retained, its, position, of, prestige, until, the, time, of, the, norman, conquest, after, which, english, ceased, for, a, time, to, be, of, importance, as, a, literary, language, the, history, of, old, english, can, be, subdivided, into, the, old, english, period, is, followed, by, middle, english, 1150, to, 1500, early, modern, english, 1500, to, 1650, and, finally, modern, english, after, 1650, and, in, scotland, early, scots, before, 1450, middle, scots, c, 1450, to, 1700, and, modern, scots, after, 1700, just, as, modern, english, is, not, monolithic, old, english, varied, according, to, place, despite, the, diversity, of, language, of, the, germanic, speaking, migrants, who, established, old, english, in, england, and, southeastern, scotland, it, is, possible, to, reconstruct, proto, old, english, as, a, fairly, unitary, language, for, the, most, part, the, differences, between, the, attested, regional, dialects, of, old, english, developed, within, england, and, southeastern, scotland, rather, than, on, the, mainland, of, europe, although, from, the, tenth, century, old, english, writing, from, all, regions, tended, to, conform, to, a, written, standard, based, on, late, west, saxon, in, speech, old, english, continued, to, exhibit, much, local, and, regional, variation, which, remained, in, middle, english, and, to, some, extent, modern, english, dialects, the, four, main, dialectal, forms, of, old, english, were, mercian, northumbrian, kentish, and, west, saxon, mercian, and, northumbrian, are, together, referred, to, as, anglian, in, terms, of, geography, the, northumbrian, region, lay, north, of, the, humber, river, the, mercian, lay, north, of, the, thames, and, south, of, the, humber, river, west, saxon, lay, south, and, southwest, of, the, thames, and, the, smallest, kentish, region, lay, southeast, of, the, thames, a, small, corner, of, england, the, kentish, region, settled, by, the, jutes, from, jutland, has, the, scantest, literary, remains, the, term, west, saxon, actually, is, represented, by, two, different, dialects, early, west, saxon, and, late, west, saxon, hogg, has, suggested, that, these, two, dialects, would, be, more, appropriately, named, alfredian, saxon, and, thelwoldian, saxon, respectively, so, that, the, naive, reader, would, not, assume, that, they, are, chronologically, related, each, of, these, four, dialects, was, associated, with, an, independent, kingdom, on, the, islands, of, these, northumbria, south, of, the, tyne, and, most, of, mercia, were, overrun, by, the, vikings, during, the, 9th, century, the, portion, of, mercia, that, was, successfully, defended, and, all, of, kent, were, then, integrated, into, wessex, under, alfred, the, great, from, that, time, on, the, west, saxon, dialect, then, in, the, form, now, known, as, early, west, saxon, became, standardised, as, the, language, of, government, and, as, the, basis, for, the, many, works, of, literature, and, religious, materials, produced, or, translated, from, latin, in, that, period, the, later, literary, standard, known, as, late, west, saxon, see, history, above, although, centred, in, the, same, region, of, the, country, appears, not, to, have, been, directly, descended, from, alfred, s, early, west, saxon, for, example, the, former, diphthong, iy, tended, to, become, monophthongised, to, i, in, ews, but, to, y, in, lws, due, to, the, centralisation, of, power, and, the, destruction, wrought, by, viking, invasions, there, is, relatively, little, written, record, of, the, non, west, saxon, dialects, after, alfred, s, unification, some, mercian, texts, continued, to, be, written, however, and, the, influence, of, mercian, is, apparent, in, some, of, the, translations, produced, under, alfred, s, programme, many, of, which, were, produced, by, mercian, scholars, other, dialects, certainly, continued, to, be, spoken, as, is, evidenced, by, the, continued, variation, between, their, successors, in, middle, and, modern, english, in, fact, what, would, become, the, standard, forms, of, middle, english, and, of, modern, english, are, descended, from, mercian, rather, than, west, saxon, while, scots, developed, from, the, northumbrian, dialect, it, was, once, claimed, that, owing, to, its, position, at, the, heart, of, the, kingdom, of, wessex, the, relics, of, anglo, saxon, accent, idiom, and, vocabulary, were, best, preserved, in, the, dialect, of, somerset, for, details, of, the, sound, differences, between, the, dialects, see, phonological, history, of, old, english, dialects, the, language, of, the, anglo, saxon, settlers, appears, not, to, have, been, significantly, affected, by, the, native, british, celtic, languages, which, it, largely, displaced, the, number, of, celtic, loanwords, introduced, into, the, language, is, very, small, although, dialect, and, toponymic, terms, are, more, often, retained, in, western, language, contact, zones, cumbria, devon, welsh, marches, and, borders, and, so, on, than, in, the, east, however, various, suggestions, have, been, made, concerning, possible, influence, that, celtic, may, have, had, on, developments, in, english, syntax, in, the, post, old, english, period, such, as, the, regular, progressive, construction, and, analytic, word, order, as, well, as, the, eventual, development, of, the, periphrastic, auxiliary, verb, do, these, ideas, have, generally, not, received, widespread, support, from, linguists, particularly, as, many, of, the, theorized, brittonicisms, do, not, become, widespread, until, the, late, middle, english, and, early, modern, english, periods, in, addition, to, the, fact, that, similar, forms, exist, in, other, modern, germanic, languages, old, english, contained, a, certain, number, of, loanwords, from, latin, which, was, the, scholarly, and, diplomatic, lingua, franca, of, western, europe, it, is, sometimes, possible, to, give, approximate, dates, for, the, borrowing, of, individual, latin, words, based, on, which, patterns, of, sound, change, they, have, undergone, some, latin, words, had, already, been, borrowed, into, the, germanic, languages, before, the, ancestral, angles, and, saxons, left, continental, europe, for, britain, more, entered, the, language, when, the, anglo, saxons, were, converted, to, christianity, and, latin, speaking, priests, became, influential, it, was, also, through, irish, christian, missionaries, that, the, latin, alphabet, was, introduced, and, adapted, for, the, writing, of, old, english, replacing, the, earlier, runic, system, nonetheless, the, largest, transfer, of, latin, based, mainly, old, french, words, into, english, occurred, after, the, norman, conquest, of, 1066, and, thus, in, the, middle, english, rather, than, the, old, english, period, another, source, of, loanwords, was, old, norse, which, came, into, contact, with, old, english, via, the, scandinavian, rulers, and, settlers, in, the, danelaw, from, the, late, 9th, century, and, during, the, rule, of, cnut, and, other, danish, kings, in, the, early, 11th, century, many, place, names, in, eastern, and, northern, england, are, of, scandinavian, origin, norse, borrowings, are, relatively, rare, in, old, english, literature, being, mostly, terms, relating, to, government, and, administration, the, literary, standard, however, was, based, on, the, west, saxon, dialect, away, from, the, main, area, of, scandinavian, influence, the, impact, of, norse, may, have, been, greater, in, the, eastern, and, northern, dialects, certainly, in, middle, english, texts, which, are, more, often, based, on, eastern, dialects, a, strong, norse, influence, becomes, apparent, modern, english, contains, many, often, everyday, words, that, were, borrowed, from, old, norse, and, the, grammatical, simplification, that, occurred, after, the, old, english, period, is, also, often, attributed, to, norse, influence, the, influence, of, old, norse, certainly, helped, move, english, from, a, synthetic, language, along, the, continuum, to, a, more, analytic, word, order, and, old, norse, most, likely, made, a, greater, impact, on, the, english, language, than, any, other, language, the, eagerness, of, vikings, in, the, danelaw, to, communicate, with, their, anglo, saxon, neighbours, produced, a, friction, that, led, to, the, erosion, of, the, complicated, inflectional, word, endings, simeon, potter, notes, no, less, far, reaching, was, the, influence, of, scandinavian, upon, the, inflexional, endings, of, english, in, hastening, that, wearing, away, and, leveling, of, grammatical, forms, which, gradually, spread, from, north, to, south, it, was, after, all, a, salutary, influence, the, gain, was, greater, than, the, loss, there, was, a, gain, in, directness, in, clarity, and, in, strength, the, strength, of, the, viking, influence, on, old, english, appears, from, the, fact, that, the, indispensable, elements, of, the, language, pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal, adverbs, like, hence, and, together, conjunctions, and, prepositions, show, the, most, marked, danish, influence, the, best, evidence, of, scandinavian, influence, appears, in, the, extensive, word, borrowings, because, as, jespersen, indicates, no, texts, exist, in, either, scandinavia, or, northern, england, from, this, time, to, give, certain, evidence, of, an, influence, on, syntax, the, effect, of, old, norse, on, old, english, was, substantive, pervasive, and, of, a, democratic, character, old, norse, and, old, english, resembled, each, other, closely, like, cousins, and, with, some, words, in, common, speakers, roughly, understood, each, other, in, time, the, inflections, melted, away, and, the, analytic, pattern, emerged, it, is, most, important, to, recognize, that, in, many, words, the, english, and, scandinavian, language, differed, chiefly, in, their, inflectional, elements, the, body, of, the, word, was, so, nearly, the, same, in, the, two, languages, that, only, the, endings, would, put, obstacles, in, the, way, of, mutual, understanding, in, the, mixed, population, which, existed, in, the, danelaw, these, endings, must, have, led, to, much, confusion, tending, gradually, to, become, obscured, and, finally, lost, this, blending, of, peoples, and, languages, resulted, in, simplifying, english, grammar, the, inventory, of, early, west, saxon, surface, phones, is, as, follows, the, sounds, enclosed, in, parentheses, in, the, chart, above, are, not, considered, to, be, phonemes, the, above, system, is, largely, similar, to, that, of, modern, english, except, that, and, for, most, speakers, have, generally, been, lost, while, the, voiced, affricate, and, fricatives, now, also, including, have, become, independent, phonemes, as, has, the, open, back, rounded, vowel, was, an, allophone, of, short, which, occurred, in, stressed, syllables, before, nasal, consonants, m, and, n, it, was, variously, spelled, either, a, or, o, the, anglian, dialects, also, had, the, mid, front, rounded, vowel, spelled, which, had, emerged, from, i, umlaut, of, o, in, west, saxon, and, kentish, it, had, already, merged, with, e, before, the, first, written, prose, other, dialects, had, different, systems, of, diphthongs, for, example, the, northumbrian, dialect, retained, i, o, which, had, merged, with, e, o, in, west, saxon, for, more, on, dialectal, differences, see, phonological, history, of, old, english, dialects, some, of, the, principal, sound, changes, occurring, in, the, pre, history, and, history, of, old, english, were, the, following, for, more, details, of, these, processes, see, the, main, article, linked, above,

from, the, germanic, 24, character, elder, futhark, extended, by, five, more, runes, used, to, represent, anglo, saxon, vowel, sounds, and, sometimes, by, several, more, additional, characters, from, around, the, 8th, century, the, runic, system, came, to, be, supplanted, by, a, minuscule, half, uncial, script, of, the, latin, alphabet, introduced, by, irish, christian, missionaries, this, was, replaced, by, insular, script, a, cursive, and, pointed, version, of, the, half, uncial, script, this, was, used, until, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, when, continental, carolingian, minuscule, also, known, as, caroline, replaced, the, insular, the, latin, alphabet, of, the, time, still, lacked, the, letters, j, and, w, and, there, was, no, v, as, distinct, from, u, moreover, native, old, english, spellings, did, not, use, k, q, or, z, the, remaining, 20, latin, letters, were, supplemented, by, four, more, sc, modern, ash, and, t, now, called, eth, or, edh, which, were, modified,

note, a, character, similar, to, the, digit, 7, for, the, conjunction, and, a, common, scribal, abbreviation, was, a, thorn, with, a, stroke, which, was, used, for, the, pronoun, t, that, macrons, over, vowels, were, originally, used, not, to, mark, long, vowels, as, in, modern, editions, but, to, indicate, stress, or, as, abbreviations, for, a, following, m, or, n, modern, editions, of, old, english, manuscripts, generally, introduce, some, additional, conventions, the, modern, forms, of, latin, letters, are, used, including, g, instead, of, insular, g, s, instead, of, insular, s, and, long, s, and, others, which, may, differ, considerably, from, the, insular, script, notably, e, f, and, r, macrons, are, used, to, indicate, long, vowels, where, usually, no, distinction, was, made, between, long, and, short, vowels, in, the, originals, in, some, older, editions, an, acute, accent, mark, was, used, for, consistency, with, old, norse, conventions, additionally, modern, editions, often, distinguish, between, velar, and, palatal, c, and, g, by, placing, dots, above, the, palatals, the, letter, wynn, is, usually, replaced, with, w, but, and, are, normally, retained, except, when, is, replaced, by, in, contrast, with, modern, english, orthography, old, english, spelling, was, reasonably, regular, with, a, mostly, predictable, correspondence, between, letters, and, phonemes, there, were, not, usually, any, silent, letters, in, the, word, cniht, for, example, both, the, c, and, h, were, pronounced, knixt, kni, t, unlike, the, k, and, gh, in, the, modern, knight,

monastic, libraries, do, not, help, us, and, there, are, no, references, in, extant, works, to, other, compositions, how, incomplete, our, materials, are, can, be, illustrated, by, the, well, known, fact, that, with, few, and, relatively, unimportant, exceptions, all, extant, anglo, saxon, poetry, is, preserved, in, four, manuscripts, some, of, the, most, important, surviving, works, of, old, english, literature, are, beowulf, an, epic, poem, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, a, record, of, early, english, history, the, franks, casket, an, inscribed, early, whalebone, artefact, and, c, dmon,

order, as, such, it, is, not, typical, of, old, english, prose, the, modern, cognates, of, original, words, have, been, used, whenever, practical, to, give, a, close, approximation, of, the, feel, of, the, original, poem, the, words, in, brackets, are, implied, in, the, old, english, by, noun, case, and, the, bold, words, in, brackets, are, explanations, of, words, that, have, slightly, different,

itself, when, english, speaking, scholars, created, english, glosses, on, latin, texts, at, first, these, were, often, marginal, or, interlinear, glosses, but, soon, came, to, be, gathered, into, word, lists, such, as, the, pinal, erfurt, leiden, and, corpus, glossaries, over, time, these, word, lists, were, consolidated, and, alphabeticised, to, create, extensive, latin, old, english, glossaries, with, some, of, the, character, of, dictionaries, such, as, the, cleopatra, glossaries, the, harley, glossary, and, the, brussels, glossary, in, some, cases, the, material, in, these, glossaries, continued, to, be, circulated, and, updated, in, middle, english, glossaries, such, as, the, durham, plant, name, glossary, and, the, laud, herbal, glossary, old, english, lexicography, was, revived, in, the, early, modern, period, drawing, heavily, on, anglo, saxons, own, glossaries, the, major, publication, at, this, time, was, william, somner, s, dictionarium, saxonico, latino, anglicum, the, next, substantial, old, english, dictionary, was, joseph, bosworth, s, anglo, saxon, dictionary, of, 1838, in, modern, scholarship, the, following, dictionaries, remain, current,

include, material, relevant, to, old, english, like, other, historical, languages, old, english, has, been, used, by, scholars, and, enthusiasts, of, later, periods, to, create, texts, either, imitating, old, english, literature, or, deliberately, transferring, it, to, a, different, cultural, context, examples, include, alistair, campbell, and, j, r, r, tolkien, ransom, riggs, uses, several, old, english, words, such, as, syndrigast, singular, peculiar, ymbryne, period, cycle, etc, dubbed, as, old, peculiar, ones, advocates, of, linguistic, purism, in, english, often, look, to, older, forms, of, english, including, old, english, as, a, means, of, either, reviving, old, words, or, coining, new, ones, a, number, of, websites, devoted, to, modern, paganism, and, historical, reenactment, offer, reference, material, and, forums, promoting, the, active, use, of, old, english, there, is, also, an, old, english, version, of, wikipedia, however, one, investigation, found, that, many, neo, old, english, texts, published, online, bear, little, resemblance, to, the, historical, language, and, have, many, basic, grammatical, mistakes
