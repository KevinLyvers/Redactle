examples, as, far, as, we, know, every, language, makes, a, grammatical, distinction, that, looks, like, a, noun, verb, distinction, possibly, because, of, the, graph, like, nature, of, communicated, meaning, by, humans, i, e, nouns, being, the, entities, and, verbs, being, the, links, between, them, in, languages, where, the, verb, is, inflected, it, often, agrees, with, its, primary, argument, the, subject, in, person, number, or, gender, with, the, exception, of, the, verb, to, be, english, shows, distinctive, agreements, only, in, the, third, person, singular, present, tense, form, of,

determined, by, the, kinds, of, words, that, accompany, it, and, the, relationship, those, words, have, with, the, verb, itself, classified, by, the, number, of, their, valency, arguments, usually, four, basic, types, are, distinguished, intransitives, transitives, ditransitives, and, double, transitive, verbs, some, verbs, have, special, grammatical, uses, and, hence, complements, such, as, copular, verbs, i, e, be, the, verb, do, used, for, do, support, in, questioning, and, negation, and, tense, or, aspect, auxiliaries, e, g, be, have, or, can, in, addition, verbs, can, be, non, finite, not, inflected, for, person, number, tense, etc, such, special, forms, as, infinitives, participles, or, gerunds, an, intransitive, verb, is, one, that, does, not, have, a, direct, object, intransitive, verbs, may, be, followed, by, an, adverb, a, word, that, addresses, how, where, when, and, how, often, or, end, a, sentence, for, example, the, woman, spoke, softly, the, athlete, ran, faster, than, the, official, the, boy, wept, a, transitive, verb, is, followed, by, a, noun, or, noun, phrase, these, noun, phrases, are, not, called, predicate, nouns, but, are, instead, called, direct, objects, because, they, refer, to, the, object, that, is, being, acted, upon, for, example, my, friend, read, the, newspaper, the, teenager, earned, a, speeding, ticket, a, way, to, identify, a, transitive, verb, is, to, invert, the, sentence, making, it, passive, for, example, the, newspaper, was, read, by, my, friend, a, speeding, ticket, was, earned, by, the, teenager, ditransitive, verbs, sometimes, called, vg, verbs, after, the, verb, give, precede, either, two, noun, phrases, or, a, noun, phrase, and, then, a, prepositional, phrase, often, led, by, to, or, for, for, example, the, players, gave, their, teammates, high, fives, the, players, gave, high, fives, to, their, teammates, when, two, noun, phrases, follow, a, transitive, verb, the, first, is, an, indirect, object, that, which, is, receiving, something, and, the, second, is, a, direct, object, that, being, acted, upon, indirect, objects, can, be, noun, phrases, or, prepositional, phrases, double, transitive, verbs, sometimes, called, vc, verbs, after, the, verb, consider, are, followed, by, a, noun, phrase, that, serves, as, a, direct, object, and, then, a, second, noun, phrase, adjective, or, infinitive, phrase, the, second, element, noun, phrase, adjective, or, infinitive, is, called, a, complement, which, completes, a, clause, that, would, not, otherwise, have, the, same, meaning, for, example, the, young, couple, considers, the, neighbors, wealthy, people, some, students, perceive, adults, quite, inaccurately, sarah, deemed, her, project, to, be, the, hardest, she, has, ever, completed, copular,

worried, josh, remained, a, reliable, friend, these, verbs, precede, nouns, or, adjectives, in, a, sentence, which, become, predicate, nouns, and, predicate, adjectives, copulae, are, thought, to, link, the, predicate, adjective, or, noun, to, the, subject, they, can, also, be, followed, by, an, adverb, of, place, which, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, predicate, adverb, for, example, my, house, is, down, the, street, the, main, copular, verb, be, is, manifested, in, eight, forms, be, is, am, are, was, were, been, and, being, in, english, the, number, of, arguments, that, a, verb, takes, is, called, its, valency, or, valence, verbs, can, be, classified, according, to, their, valency, weather, verbs, often, appear, to, be, impersonal, subjectless, or, avalent, in, null, subject, languages, like, spanish, where, the, verb, llueve, means, it, rains, in, english, french, and, german, they, require, a, dummy, pronoun, and, therefore, formally, have, a, valency, of, 1, as, verbs, in, spanish, incorporate, the, subject, as, a, tam, suffix, spanish, is, not, actually, a, null, subject, language, unlike, mandarin, see, above, such, verbs, in, spanish, also, have, a, valency, of, 1, intransitive, and, transitive, verbs, are, the, most, common, but, the, impersonal, and, objective, verbs, are, somewhat, different, from, the, norm, in, the, objective, the, verb, takes, an, object, but, no, subject, the, nonreferent, subject, in, some, uses, may, be, marked, in, the, verb, by, an, incorporated, dummy, pronoun, similar, to, that, used, with, the, english, weather, verbs, impersonal, verbs, in, null, subject, languages, take, neither, subject, nor, object, as, is, true, of, other, verbs, but, again, the, verb, may, show, incorporated, dummy, pronouns, despite, the, lack, of, subject, and, object, phrases, verbs, are, often, flexible, with, regard, to, valency, in, non, valency, marking, languages, such, as, english, a, transitive, verb, can, often, drop, its, object, and, become, intransitive, or, an, intransitive, verb, can, take, an, object, and, become, transitive, for, example, in, english, the, verb, move, has, no, grammatical, object, in, he, moves, though, in, this, case, the, subject, itself, may, be, an, implied, object, also, expressible, explicitly, as, in, he, moves, himself, but, in, he, moves, the, car, the, subject, and, object, are, distinct, and, the, verb, has, a, different, valency, some, verbs, in, english, have, historically, derived, forms, that, show, change, of, valency, in, some, causative, verbs, such, as, fall, fell, fallen, fell, felled, felled, rise, rose, risen, raise, raised, raised, cost, cost, cost, cost, costed, costed, in, valency, marking, languages, valency, change, is, shown, by, inflecting, the, verb, in, order, to, change, the, valency, in, kalaw, lagaw, ya, of, australia, for, example, verbs, distinguish, valency, by, argument, agreement, suffixes, and, tam, endings, verb, structure, manga, i, tam, arrive, active, singular, dual, plural, tam, verb, structure, manga, tam, arrive, attainative, singular, dual, plural, tam, the, verb, stem, manga, to, take, come, arrive, at, the, destination,

perfective, found, with, all, numbers, in, the, perfective, except, the, singular, active, where, ma, is, found, depending, on, the, language, verbs, may, express, grammatical, tense, aspect, or, modality, grammatical, tense, is, the, use, of, auxiliary, verbs, or, inflections, to, convey, whether, the, action, or, state, is, before, simultaneous, with, or, after, some, reference, point, the, reference, point, could, be, the, time, of, utterance, in, which, case, the, verb, expresses, absolute, tense, or, it, could, be, a, past, present, or, future, time, of, reference, previously, established, in, the, sentence, in, which, case, the, verb, expresses, relative, tense, aspect, expresses, how, the, action, or, state, occurs, through, time, important, examples, include, aspect, can, either, be, lexical, in, which, case, the, aspect, is, embedded, in, the, verb, s, meaning, as, in, the, sun, shines, where, shines, is, lexically, stative, or, it, can, be, grammatically,

examples, if, the, verbal, expression, of, modality, involves, the, use, of, an, auxiliary, verb, that, auxiliary, is, called, a, modal, verb, if, the, verbal, expression, of, modality, involves, inflection, we, have, the, special, case, of, mood, moods, include, the, indicative, as, in, i, am, there, the, subjunctive, as, in, i, wish, i, were, there, and, the, imperative, be, there, the, voice, of, a, verb, expresses, whether, the, subject, of, the, verb, is, performing, the, action, of, the, verb, or, whether, the, action, is, being, performed, on, the, subject, the, two, most,
