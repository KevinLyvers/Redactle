classical, chinese, is, the, language, in, which, the, classics, of, chinese, literature, were, written, from, c, the, 5th, century, bce, for, millennia, thereafter, the, written, chinese, used, in, these, works, was, imitated, and, iterated, upon, by, scholars, in, a, form, now, called, literary, chinese, which, was, used, for, almost, all, formal, writing, in, china, until, the, early, 20th, century, each, written, character, corresponds, to, a, single, spoken, syllable, and, almost, always, to, a, single, independent, word, as, a, result, the, characteristic, style, of, the, language, is, comparatively, terse, starting, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, use, of, literary, chinese, spread, to, the, countries, surrounding, china, including, vietnam, korea, japan, and, the, ryukyu, islands, where, it, represented, the, only, known, form, of, writing, literary, chinese, was, adopted, as, the, language, of, civil, administration, in, these, countries, creating, what, is, known, as, the, sinosphere, each, additionally, developed, systems, of, readings, and, annotations, that, enabled, non, chinese, speakers, to, interpret, literary, chinese, texts, in, terms, of, the, local, vernacular, while, not, static, throughout, its, history, its, evolution, has, traditionally, been, guided, by, a, conservative, impulse, many, later, changes, in, the, varieties, of, chinese, are, not, reflected, in, the, literary, form, due, to, millennia, of, this, evolution, literary, chinese, is, only, partially, intelligible, when, read, or, spoken, aloud, for, someone, only, familiar, with, modern, vernacular, forms, literary, chinese, has, largely, been, replaced, by, written, vernacular, chinese, among, chinese, speakers, speakers, of, non, chinese, languages, have, similarly, abandoned, literary, chinese, in, favour, of, their, own, local, vernaculars, although, varieties, of, chinese, have, diverged, in, various, directions, from, the, old, chinese, words, in, the, classical, lexicon, many, cognates, can, still, be, found, there, is, no, universal, agreement, on, the, definition, of, classical, chinese, at, its, core, the, term, refers, to, the, language, used, by, the, classics, of, chinese, literature, roughly, from, the, 5th, century, bce, to, the, end, of, the, han, dynasty, 202, bce, 220, ce, the, form, of, chinese, used, in, works, written, before, the, 4th, century, bce, like, the, five, classics, is, distinct, from, that, found, in, later, works, the, term, pre, classical, chinese, is, used, to, distinguish, this, earlier, form, from, classical, chinese, proper, as, it, did, not, inspire, later, imitation, to, a, comparable, degree, despite, the, works, equal, importance, in, the, canon, after, the, han, dynasty, the, divergence, of, spoken, language, from, the, literary, form, became, increasingly, apparent, the, term, literary, chinese, has, been, coined, to, refer, to, the, later, forms, of, written, chinese, in, conscious, imitation, of, the, classics, with, sinologists, generally, emphasizing, distinctions, such, as, the, gradual, addition, of, new, vocabulary, and, the, erosion, of, certain, points, of, classical, grammar, as, their, functions, were, forgotten, literary, chinese, was, used, in, almost, all, formal, and, personal, writing, in, china, from, the, end, of, the, han, dynasty, until, the, early, 20th, century, when, it, was, largely, replaced, by, written, vernacular, chinese, a, distinct, narrower, definition, of, the, classical, period, begins, with, the, life, of, confucius, 551, 479, bce, and, ends, with, the, founding, of, the, qin, dynasty, in, 221, bce, the, adoption, of, chinese, literary, culture, in, the, sinosphere, amid, the, existence, of, various, regional, vernaculars, is, an, example, of, diglossia, the, coexistence, of, literary, chinese, and, native, languages, throughout, china, japan, korea, and, vietnam, can, be, compared, to, the, historical, literary, use, of, latin, in, europe, that, of, arabic, in, persia, or, that, of, sanskrit, in, south, and, southeast, asia, however, unlike, these, examples, written, chinese, uses, a, logography, of, chinese, characters, that, are, not, directly, tied, to, their, pronunciation, this, lack, of, a, fixed, correspondence, between, writing, and, reading, created, a, situation, where, later, readings, of, classical, chinese, texts, were, able, to, diverge, much, further, from, their, originals, than, occurred, in, the, other, literary, traditions, adding, a, unique, dimension, to, the, study, of, literary, chinese, literary, chinese, was, adopted, in, korea, japan, and, vietnam, the, oxford, handbook, of, classical, chinese, literature, states, that, this, adoption, came, mainly, from, diplomatic, and, cultural, ties, with, china, while, conquest, colonization, and, migration, played, smaller, roles, unlike, latin, and, sanskrit, historical, chinese, language, theory, consisted, almost, exclusively, of, lexicography, as, opposed, to, the, study, of, grammar, and, syntax, such, approaches, largely, arrived, with, europeans, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, christian, missionaries, later, coined, the, term, w, nl, principles, of, literature, bookish, language, to, describe, classical, chinese, this, term, never, became, widely, used, among, domestic, speakers, according, to, the, traditional, burning, of, books, and, burying, of, scholars, account, in, 213, bce, qin, shi, huang, ordered, the, historical, records, of, all, non, qin, states, to, be, burned, along, with, any, literature, associated, with, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, the, imperial, library, was, destroyed, upon, the, dynasty, s, collapse, in, 206, bce, resulting, in, a, potentially, greater, loss, even, works, from, the, classical, period, that, have, survived, are, not, known, to, exist, in, their, original, forms, and, are, attested, only, in, manuscripts, copied, centuries, after, their, original, composition, the, yiwenzhi, section, of, the, book, of, han, 111, ce, is, the, oldest, extant, bibliography, of, classical, chinese, compiled, c, 90, ce, only, 6, of, its, 653, listed, works, are, known, to, exist, in, a, complete, form, with, another, 6, existing, only, in, fragments, compared, to, written, vernacular, chinese, classical, chinese, is, terse, and, compact, in, its, style, and, uses, some, different, vocabulary, classical, chinese, rarely, uses, words, two, or, more, characters, in, length, classical, chinese, can, be, described, as, a, pro, drop, language, its, syntax, often, allows, either, subjects, or, objects, to, be, dropped, when, their, reference, is, understood, additionally, words, are, generally, not, restricted, to, use, as, certain, parts, of, speech, many, characters, may, function, as, either, a, noun, verb, or, adjective, there, is, no, general, copula, in, classical, chinese, akin, to, how, sh, is, used, in, modern, standard, chinese, characters, that, can, sometimes, function, as, a, copula, in, specific, circumstances, include, w, i, make, do, when, indicating, temporary, circumstances, and, yu, say, when, used, in, the, sense, of, to, be, called, classical, chinese, has, more, pronouns, compared, to, the, modern, vernacular, in, particular, whereas, modern, standard, chinese, has, one, character, generally, used, as, a, first, person, pronoun, classical, chinese, has, several, many, of, which, are, used, as, part, of, a, system, of, honorifics, many, final, and, interrogative, particles, are, found, in, classical, chinese, beyond, differences, in, grammar, and, vocabulary, classical, chinese, can, be, distinguished, by, its, literary, qualities, an, effort, to, maintain, parallelism, and, rhythm, is, typical, even, in, prose, works, works, also, make, extensive, use, of, literary, techniques, such, as, allusion, which, contributes, to, the, language, s, brevity, prior, to, the, literary, revolution, in, china, that, began, with, the, 1919, may, fourth, movement, prominent, examples, of, vernacular, chinese, literature, include, the, 18th, century, novel, dream, of, the, red, chamber, most, government, documents, in, the, republic, of, china, were, written, in, literary, chinese, until, reforms, spearheaded, by, president, yen, chia, kan, in, the, 1970s, to, shift, to, written, vernacular, chinese, however, most, of, the, laws, of, taiwan, are, still, written, in, a, subset, of, literary, chinese, as, a, result, it, is, necessary, for, modern, taiwanese, lawyers, to, learn, at, least, a, subset, of, the, literary, language, many, works, of, literature, in, classical, and, literary, chinese, have, been, highly, influential, in, chinese, culture, such, as, the, canon, of, tang, poetry, however, even, with, knowledge, of, its, grammar, and, vocabulary, works, in, literary, chinese, can, be, difficult, for, native, vernacular, speakers, to, understand, due, to, its, frequent, allusions, and, references, to, other, historical, literature, as, well, as, the, extremely, laconic, style, presently, pure, literary, chinese, is, occasionally, used, in, formal, or, ceremonial, contexts, for, example, the, national, anthem, of, the, republic, of, china, is, in, literary, chinese, buddhist, texts, in, literary, chinese, are, still, preserved, from, the, time, they, were, composed, or, translated, from, sanskrit, in, practice, there, is, a, socially, accepted, continuum, between, vernacular, and, literary, chinese, for, example, most, official, notices, and, formal, letters, use, stock, literary, expressions, within, vernacular, prose, personal, use, of, classical, phrases, depends, on, factors, such, as, the, subject, matter, and, the, level, of, education, of, the, writer, excepting, professional, scholars, and, enthusiasts, most, modern, writers, cannot, easily, write, in, literary, chinese, even, so, most, chinese, people, with, at, least, a, middle, school, education, are, able, to, read, basic, literary, chinese, because, this, ability, is, part, of, the, chinese, middle, school, and, high, school, curricula, and, is, a, component, of, the, college, entrance, examination, literary, chinese, in, the, school, curriculum, is, taught, primarily, by, presenting, a, literary, work, and, including, a, vernacular, gloss, that, explains, the, meaning, of, phrases, the, examinations, usually, require, the, student, to, read, a, paragraph, in, literary, chinese, and, then, explain, its, meaning, in, the, vernacular, contemporary, use, of, literary, chinese, in, japan, is, mainly, in, the, field, of, education, and, the, study, of, literature, learning, kanbun, the, japanese, readings, of, literary, chinese, is, part, of, the, high, school, curriculum, in, japan, japan, is, the, only, country, that, maintains, the, tradition, of, creating, literary, chinese, poetry, based, on, tang, era, tone, patterns, chinese, characters, are, not, phonetic, and, rarely, reflect, later, sound, changes, in, words, efforts, to, reconstruct, old, chinese, pronunciation, began, relatively, recently, literary, chinese, is, not, read, with, a, reconstructed, old, chinese, pronunciation, instead, it, is, read, with, the, pronunciations, as, categorized, and, listed, in, a, rime, dictionary, originally, based, upon, the, middle, chinese, pronunciation, in, luoyang, between, the, 2nd, and, 4th, centuries, over, time, each, dynasty, updated, and, modified, the, official, rime, dictionary, by, the, time, of, the, yuan, and, ming, dynasties, its, phonology, reflected, that, of, early, mandarin, as, the, imperial, examination, system, required, the, candidate, to, compose, poetry, in, the, shi, genre, pronunciation, in, non, mandarin, speaking, parts, of, china, such, as, zhejiang, guangdong, and, fujian, is, either, based, on, everyday, speech, such, as, in, standard, cantonese, or, is, based, on, a, special, set, of, pronunciations, borrowed, from, classical, chinese, such, as, in, southern, min, in, practice, all, varieties, of, chinese, combine, the, two, extremes, of, pronunciation, that, according, to, a, prescribed, system, versus, that, based, on, everyday, speech, mandarin, and, cantonese, for, example, also, have, words, that, are, pronounced, one, way, in, colloquial, usage, and, another, way, when, used, in, literary, chinese, or, in, specialized, terms, coming, from, literary, chinese, though, the, system, is, not, as, extensive, as, that, of, min, or, wu, japanese, korean, and, vietnamese, readers, of, literary, chinese, each, use, distinct, systems, of, pronunciation, specific, to, their, own, languages, japanese, speakers, have, readings, of, chinese, origin, called, on, yomi, for, many, words, such, as, for, ginko, or, tokyo, but, use, kun, yomi, when, the, kanji, represents, a, native, word, such, as, the, reading, of, in, iku, or, the, reading, of, both, characters, in, osaka, as, well, as, a, system, that, aids, japanese, speakers, with, a, classical, word, order, as, pronunciation, in, modern, varieties, is, different, from, old, chinese, as, well, as, other, historical, forms, such, as, middle, chinese, characters, that, once, rhymed, may, not, any, longer, or, vice, versa, poetry, and, other, rhyme, based, writing, thus, becomes, less, coherent, than, the, original, reading, must, have, been, however, some, modern, chinese, varieties, have, certain, phonological, characteristics, that, are, closer, to, the, older, pronunciations, than, others, as, shown, by, the, preservation, of, certain, rhyme, structures, another, particular, characteristic, of, literary, chinese, is, its, present, homophony, reading, classical, texts, with, character, pronunciations, from, modern, languages, results, in, many, homophonous, characters, that, originally, had, distinct, old, chinese, pronunciations, but, have, since, merged, to, varying, degrees, this, phenomenon, is, far, more, common, in, chinese, languages, than, in, english, for, example, each, of, the, following, words, had, a, distinct, old, chinese, pronunciation, but, are, now, perfectly, homophones, with, a, pronunciation, of, y, in, standard, chinese, the, poem, lion, eating, poet, in, the, stone, den, was, composed, during, the, 1930s, by, the, linguist, yuen, ren, chao, to, demonstrate, this, it, contains, only, words, pronounced, shi, with, various, tones, in, modern, standard, chinese, the, poem, underlines, how, language, had, become, impractical, for, modern, speakers, when, spoken, aloud, literary, chinese, is, largely, incomprehensible, however, the, poem, is, perfectly, comprehensible, when, read, and, also, uses, homophones, that, were, present, even, in, old, chinese, romanizations, have, been, devised, to, provide, distinct, spellings, for, literary, chinese, words, together, with, pronunciation, rules, for, various, modern, varieties, the, earliest, was, the, romanisation, interdialectique, by, french, missionaries, henri, lamasse, of, the, paris, foreign, missions, society, and, ernest, jasmin, based, on, middle, chinese, followed, by, linguist, wang, li, s, w, ny, n, lu, m, z, based, on, old, chinese, in, 1940, and, then, by, chao, s, general, chinese, romanization, in, 1975, however, none, of, these, systems, have, seen, extensive, use
