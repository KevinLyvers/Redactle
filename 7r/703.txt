psychology, of, religion, consists, of, the, application, of, psychological, methods, and, interpretive, frameworks, to, the, diverse, contents, of, religious, traditions, as, well, as, to, both, religious, and, irreligious, individuals, the, various, methods, and, frameworks, can, be, summarized, according, to, the, classic, distinction, between, the, natural, scientific, and, human, scientific, approaches, the, first, cluster, amounts, to, objective, quantitative, and, preferably, experimental, procedures, for, testing, hypotheses, about, causal, connections, among, the, objects, of, one, s, study, in, contrast, the, human, scientific, approach, accesses, the, human, world, of, experience, using, qualitative, phenomenological, and, interpretive, methods, this, approach, aims, to, discern, meaningful, rather, than, causal, connections, among, the, phenomena, one, seeks, to, understand, psychologists, of, religion, pursue, three, major, projects, the, psychology, of, religion, first, arose, as, a, self, conscious, discipline, in, the, late, 19th, century, but, all, three, of, these, tasks, have, a, history, going, back, many, centuries, before, that, the, challenge, for, the, psychology, of, religion, is, essentially, threefold, the, first, descriptive, task, naturally, requires, a, clarification, of, one, s, terms, above, all, the, word, religion, historians, of, religion, have, long, underscored, the, problematic, character, of, this, term, they, note, that, its, usage, over, the, centuries, has, changed, in, significant, ways, generally, in, the, direction, of, reification, the, early, psychologists, of, religion, were, fully, aware, of, these, difficulties, typically, acknowledging, that, the, definitions, they, chose, were, to, some, degree, arbitrary, with, the, rise, of, positivistic, trends, in, psychology, over, the, 20th, century, especially, the, demand, that, all, phenomena, be, operationalized, by, quantitative, procedures, psychologists, of, religion, developed, a, multitude, of, scales, most, of, them, developed, for, use, by, protestant, christians, factor, analysis, was, also, brought, into, play, by, both, psychologists, and, sociologists, of, religion, to, establish, a, fixed, core, of, dimensions, and, a, corresponding, set, of, scales, the, justification, and, adequacy, of, these, efforts, especially, in, the, light, of, constructivist, and, other, postmodern, viewpoints, remains, a, matter, of, debate, in, the, last, several, decades, especially, among, clinical, psychologists, a, preference, for, the, terms, spirituality, and, spiritual, has, emerged, along, with, efforts, to, distinguish, them, from, religion, and, religious, especially, in, the, united, states, religion, has, for, many, become, associated, with, sectarian, institutions, and, their, obligatory, creeds, and, rituals, thus, giving, the, word, a, negative, cast, spirituality, in, contrast, is, positively, constructed, as, deeply, individual, and, subjective, as, a, universal, capacity, to, apprehend, and, accord, one, s, life, with, higher, realities, in, fact, spirituality, has, likewise, undergone, an, evolution, in, the, west, from, a, time, when, it, was, essentially, a, synonym, for, religion, in, its, original, subjective, meaning, today, efforts, are, ongoing, to, operationalize, these, terms, with, little, regard, for, their, history, in, their, western, context, and, with, the, apparent, realist, assumption, that, underlying, them, are, fixed, qualities, identifiable, using, empirical, procedures, schnitker, and, emmons, theorized, that, the, understanding, of, religion, as, a, search, for, meaning, makes, implications, in, the, three, psychological, areas, of, motivation, cognition, and, social, relationships, the, cognitive, aspects, relate, to, god, and, a, sense, of, purpose, the, motivational, ones, to, the, need, to, control, and, the, religious, search, for, meaning, is, also, woven, into, social, communities, edwin, diller, starbuck, is, considered, a, pioneer, of, the, psychology, of, religion, and, his, book, psychology, of, religion, 1899, has, been, described, as, the, first, book, in, the, genre, this, book, had, the, endorsement, of, william, james, who, wrote, a, preface, to, it, starbuck, s, work, would, influence, james, own, book, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, with, james, thanking, him, in, the, preface, for, having, made, over, to, me, his, large, collection, of, manuscript, material, in, the, book, itself, james, mentions, starbuck, s, name, 46, times, and, cites, him, on, dozens, of, occasions, american, psychologist, and, philosopher, william, james, 1842, 1910, is, regarded, by, most, psychologists, of, religion, as, the, founder, of, the, field, he, served, as, president, of, the, american, psychological, association, and, wrote, one, of, the, first, psychology, textbooks, in, the, psychology, of, religion, james, influence, endures, his, varieties, of, religious, experience, is, considered, to, be, the, classic, work, in, the, field, and, references, to, james, ideas, are, common, at, professional, conferences, james, distinguished, between, institutional, religion, and, personal, religion, institutional, religion, refers, to, the, religious, group, or, organization, and, plays, an, important, part, in, a, society, s, culture, personal, religion, in, which, the, individual, has, mystical, experience, can, be, experienced, regardless, of, the, culture, james, was, most, interested, in, understanding, personal, religious, experience, in, studying, personal, religious, experiences, james, made, a, distinction, between, healthy, minded, and, sick, souled, religiousness, individuals, predisposed, to, healthy, mindedness, tend, to, ignore, the, evil, in, the, world, and, focus, on, the, positive, and, the, good, james, used, examples, of, walt, whitman, and, the, mind, cure, religious, movement, to, illustrate, healthy, mindedness, in, the, varieties, of, religious, experience, in, contrast, individuals, predisposed, to, having, a, sick, souled, religion, are, unable, to, ignore, evil, and, suffering, and, need, a, unifying, experience, religious, or, otherwise, to, reconcile, good, and, evil, james, included, quotations, from, leo, tolstoy, and, john, bunyan, to, illustrate, the, sick, soul, william, james, hypothesis, of, pragmatism, stems, from, the, efficacy, of, religion, if, an, individual, believes, in, and, performs, religious, activities, and, those, actions, happen, to, work, then, that, practice, appears, the, proper, choice, for, the, individual, however, if, the, processes, of, religion, have, little, efficacy, then, there, is, no, rationality, for, continuing, the, practice, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, described, all, systems, of, religion, philosophy, and, social, science, as, expressions, of, the, basic, urge, of, consciousness, to, learn, about, itself, and, its, surroundings, and, record, its, findings, and, hypotheses, thus, religion, is, only, a, form, of, that, search, for, knowledge, within, which, humans, record, various, experiences, and, reflections, others, compiling, and, categorizing, these, writings, in, various, ways, form, the, consolidated, worldview, as, articulated, by, that, religion, philosophy, social, science, etc, his, work, the, phenomenology, of, spirit, was, a, study, of, how, various, types, of, writing, and, thinking, draw, from, and, re, combine, with, the, individual, and, group, experiences, of, various, places, and, times, influencing, the, current, forms, of, knowledge, and, worldviews, that, are, operative, in, a, population, this, activity, is, the, functioning, of, an, incomplete, group, mind, where, each, is, accessing, the, recorded, wisdom, of, others, his, works, often, include, detailed, descriptions, of, the, psychological, motivations, involved, in, thought, and, behavior, e, g, the, struggle, of, a, community, or, nation, to, know, itself, and, thus, correctly, govern, itself, in, hegel, s, system, religion, is, one, of, the, major, repositories, of, wisdom, to, be, used, in, these, struggles, representing, a, huge, body, of, recollections, from, humanity, s, past, in, various, stages, of, its, development, sigmund, freud, 1856, 1939, gave, explanations, of, the, genesis, of, religion, in, his, various, writings, in, totem, and, taboo, he, applied, the, idea, of, the, oedipus, complex, involving, unresolved, sexual, feelings, of, for, example, a, son, toward, his, mother, and, hostility, toward, his, father, and, postulated, its, emergence, in, the, primordial, stage, of, human, development, in, moses, and, monotheism, freud, reconstructed, biblical, history, by, his, general, theory, his, ideas, were, also, developed, in, the, future, of, an, illusion, when, freud, spoke, of, religion, as, an, illusion, he, maintained, that, it, is, a, fantasy, structure, from, which, a, man, must, be, set, free, if, he, is, to, grow, to, maturity, freud, views, the, idea, of, god, as, being, a, version, of, the, father, image, and, religious, belief, as, at, bottom, infantile, and, neurotic, authoritarian, religion, freud, believed, is, dysfunctional, and, alienates, man, from, himself, the, swiss, psychoanalyst, carl, jung, 1875, 1961, adopted, a, very, different, posture, one, that, was, more, sympathetic, to, religion, and, more, concerned, with, a, positive, appreciation, of, religious, symbolism, jung, considered, the, question, of, the, metaphysical, existence, of, god, to, be, unanswerable, by, the, psychologist, and, adopted, a, kind, of, agnosticism, jung, postulated, in, addition, to, the, personal, unconscious, roughly, adopting, freud, s, concept, the, collective, unconscious, which, is, the, repository, of, human, experience, and, which, contains, archetypes, i, e, basic, images, that, are, universal, in, that, they, recur, regardless, of, culture, the, irruption, of, these, images, from, the, unconscious, into, the, realm, of, consciousness, he, viewed, as, the, basis, of, religious, experience, and, often, of, artistic, creativity, some, of, jung, s, writings, have, been, devoted, to, elucidating, some, of, the, archetypal, symbols, and, include, his, work, in, comparative, mythology, austrian, psychiatrist, alfred, adler, 1870, 1937, who, parted, ways, with, freud, emphasized, the, role, of, goals, and, motivation, in, his, individual, psychology, one, of, adler, s, most, famous, ideas, is, that, we, try, to, compensate, for, inferiorities, that, we, perceive, in, ourselves, a, lack, of, power, often, lies, at, the, root, of, feelings, of, inferiority, one, way, that, religion, enters, into, this, picture, is, through, our, beliefs, in, god, which, are, characteristic, of, our, tendency, to, strive, for, perfection, and, superiority, for, example, in, many, religions, god, is, considered, to, be, perfect, and, omnipotent, and, commands, people, likewise, to, be, perfect, if, we, too, achieve, perfection, we, become, one, with, god, by, identifying, with, god, in, this, way, we, compensate, for, our, imperfections, and, feelings, of, inferiority, our, ideas, about, god, are, important, indicators, of, how, we, view, the, world, according, to, adler, these, ideas, have, changed, over, time, as, our, vision, of, the, world, and, our, place, in, it, has, changed, consider, this, example, that, adler, offers, the, traditional, belief, that, people, were, placed, deliberately, on, earth, as, god, s, ultimate, creation, is, being, replaced, with, the, idea, that, people, have, evolved, by, natural, selection, this, coincides, with, a, view, of, god, not, as, a, real, being, but, as, an, abstract, representation, of, nature, s, forces, in, this, way, our, view, of, god, has, changed, from, one, that, was, concrete, and, specific, to, one, that, is, more, general, from, adler, s, vantage, point, this, is, a, relatively, ineffective, perception, of, god, because, it, is, so, general, that, it, fails, to, convey, a, strong, sense, of, direction, and, purpose, an, important, thing, for, adler, is, that, god, or, the, idea, of, god, motivates, people, to, act, and, that, those, actions, do, have, real, consequences, for, ourselves, and, others, our, view, of, god, is, important, because, it, embodies, our, goals, and, directs, our, social, interactions, compared, to, science, another, social, movement, religion, is, more, efficient, because, it, motivates, people, more, effectively, according, to, adler, only, when, science, begins, to, capture, the, same, religious, fervor, and, promotes, the, welfare, of, all, segments, of, society, will, the, two, be, more, equal, in, peoples, eyes, in, his, 1950, book, the, individual, and, his, religion, gordon, allport, 1897, 1967, illustrates, how, people, may, use, religion, in, different, ways, he, makes, a, distinction, between, mature, religion, and, immature, religion, mature, religious, sentiment, is, how, allport, characterized, the, person, whose, approach, to, religion, is, dynamic, open, minded, and, able, to, maintain, links, between, inconsistencies, in, contrast, immature, religion, is, self, serving, and, generally, represents, the, negative, stereotypes, that, people, have, about, religion, more, recently, this, distinction, has, been, encapsulated, in, the, terms, intrinsic, religion, referring, to, a, genuine, heartfelt, devout, faith, and, extrinsic, religion, referring, to, a, more, utilitarian, use, of, religion, as, a, means, to, an, end, such, as, church, attendance, to, gain, social, status, these, dimensions, of, religion, were, measured, on, the, religious, orientation, scale, of, allport, and, ross, the, third, form, of, religious, orientation, has, been, described, by, daniel, batson, this, refers, to, treatment, of, religion, as, an, open, ended, search, more, specifically, it, has, been, seen, by, batson, as, comprising, a, willingness, to, view, religious, doubts, positively, acceptance, that, religious, orientation, can, change, and, existential, complexity, the, belief, that, one, s, religious, beliefs, should, be, shaped, from, personal, crises, that, one, has, experienced, in, one, s, life, batson, refers, to, extrinsic, intrinsic, and, quests, respectively, as, religion, as, means, religion, as, end, and, religion, as, quest, and, measures, these, constructs, on, the, religious, life, inventory, erik, erikson, 1902, 1994, is, best, known, for, his, theory, of, psychological, development, which, has, its, roots, in, the, psychoanalytic, importance, of, identity, in, personality, his, biographies, of, gandhi, and, martin, luther, reveal, erikson, s, positive, view, of, religion, he, considered, religions, to, be, important, influences, in, successful, personality, development, because, they, are, the, primary, way, that, cultures, promote, the, virtues, associated, with, each, stage, of, life, religious, rituals, facilitate, this, development, erikson, s, theory, has, not, benefited, from, systematic, empirical, study, but, it, remains, an, influential, and, well, regarded, theory, in, the, psychological, study, of, religion, the, american, scholar, erich, fromm, 1900, 1980, modified, the, freudian, theory, and, produced, a, more, complex, account, of, the, functions, of, religion, in, his, book, psychoanalysis, and, religion, he, responded, to, freud, s, theories, by, explaining, that, part, of, the, modification, is, viewing, the, oedipus, complex, as, based, not, so, much, on, sexuality, as, on, a, much, more, profound, desire, namely, the, childish, desire, to, remain, attached, to, protecting, figures, the, right, religion, in, fromm, s, estimation, can, in, principle, foster, an, individual, s, highest, potentialities, but, religion, in, practice, tends, to, relapse, into, being, neurotic, according, to, fromm, humans, need, a, stable, frame, of, reference, religion, fills, this, need, in, effect, humans, crave, answers, to, questions, that, no, other, source, of, knowledge, has, an, answer, to, which, only, religion, may, seem, to, answer, however, a, sense, of, free, will, must, be, given, for, religion, to, appear, healthy, an, authoritarian, notion, of, religion, appears, detrimental, rudolf, otto, 1869, 1937, was, a, german, protestant, theologian, and, scholar, of, comparative, religion, otto, s, most, famous, work, the, idea, of, the, holy, published, first, in, 1917, as, das, heilige, defines, the, concept, of, the, holy, as, that, which, is, numinous, otto, explained, the, numinous, as, a, non, rational, non, sensory, experience, or, feeling, whose, primary, and, immediate, object, is, outside, the, self, it, is, a, mystery, latin, mysterium, tremendum, that, is, both, fascinating, fascinans, and, terrifying, at, the, same, time, a, mystery, that, causes, trembling, and, fascination, attempting, to, explain, that, inexpressible, and, perhaps, supernatural, emotional, reaction, of, wonder, drawing, us, to, seemingly, ordinary, and, or, religious, experiences, of, grace, this, sense, of, emotional, wonder, appears, evident, at, the, root, of, all, religious, experiences, through, this, emotional, wonder, we, suspend, our, rational, mind, for, non, rational, possibilities, the, idea, of, the, holy, also, set, out, a, paradigm, for, the, study, of, religion, that, focuses, on, the, need, to, realize, the, religious, as, a, non, reducible, original, category, in, its, own, right, this, paradigm, was, under, much, attack, between, approximately, 1950, and, 1990, but, has, made, a, strong, comeback, since, then, autobiographal, accounts, of, 20th, century, psychology, of, religion, as, a, field, have, been, supplied, by, numerous, modern, psychologists, of, religion, primarily, based, in, europe, but, also, by, several, us, based, psychologists, such, as, ralph, w, hood, and, donald, capps, allen, bergin, is, noted, for, his, 1980, paper, psychotherapy, and, religious, values, which, is, known, as, a, landmark, in, scholarly, acceptance, that, religious, values, do, in, practice, influence, psychotherapy, he, received, the, distinguished, professional, contributions, to, knowledge, award, from, the, american, psychological, association, in, 1989, and, was, cited, as, challenging, psychological, orthodoxy, to, emphasize, the, importance, of, values, and, religion, in, therapy, robert, a, emmons, offered, a, theory, of, spiritual, strivings, in, his, 1999, book, the, psychology, of, ultimate, concerns, with, support, from, empirical, studies, emmons, argued, that, spiritual, strivings, foster, personality, integration, because, they, exist, at, a, higher, level, of, the, personality, ralph, w, hood, jr, is, a, professor, of, psychology, at, the, university, of, tennessee, at, chattanooga, he, is, a, former, editor, of, the, journal, for, the, scientific, study, of, religion, and, a, former, co, editor, of, the, archive, for, the, psychology, of, religion, and, the, international, journal, for, the, psychology, of, religion, he, is, past, president, of, division, 36, of, the, american, psychological, association, and, a, recipient, of, its, william, james, award, he, has, published, several, hundred, articles, and, book, chapters, on, the, psychology, of, religion, and, has, authored, co, authored, or, edited, thirteen, volumes, all, dealing, with, the, psychology, of, religion, kenneth, pargament, is, noted, for, his, book, psychology, of, religion, and, coping, 1997, as, well, as, for, a, 2007, book, on, religion, and, psychotherapy, and, a, sustained, research, program, on, religious, coping, he, is, professor, of, psychology, at, bowling, green, state, university, ohio, us, and, has, published, more, than, 100, papers, on, the, subject, of, religion, and, spirituality, in, psychology, pargament, led, the, design, of, a, questionnaire, called, the, rcope, to, measure, religious, coping, strategies, pargament, has, distinguished, between, three, types, of, styles, for, coping, with, stress, james, hillman, at, the, end, of, his, book, re, visioning, psychology, reverses, james, position, of, viewing, religion, through, psychology, urging, instead, that, we, view, psychology, as, a, variety, of, religious, experience, he, concludes, psychology, as, religion, implies, imagining, all, psychological, events, as, effects, of, gods, in, the, soul, julian, jaynes, primarily, in, his, book, the, origin, of, consciousness, in, the, breakdown, of, the, bicameral, mind, proposed, that, religion, and, some, other, psychological, phenomena, such, as, hypnosis, and, schizophrenia, is, a, remnant, of, a, relatively, recent, time, in, human, development, prior, to, the, advent, of, consciousness, jaynes, hypothesized, that, hallucinated, verbal, commands, helped, non, conscious, early, man, to, perform, tasks, promoting, human, survival, starting, about, 10, 000, bce, selective, pressures, favored, the, hallucinated, verbal, commands, for, social, control, and, they, came, to, be, perceived, as, an, external, rather, than, internal, voice, commanding, the, person, to, take, some, action, these, were, hence, often, explained, as, originating, from, invisible, gods, spirits, and, ancestors, there, are, three, primary, hypotheses, on, the, role, of, religion, in, the, modern, world, the, first, hypothesis, secularization, holds, that, science, and, technology, will, take, the, place, of, religion, secularization, supports, the, separation, of, religion, from, politics, ethics, and, psychology, taking, this, position, even, further, taylor, explains, that, secularization, denies, transcendence, divinity, and, rationality, in, religious, beliefs, challenges, to, the, secularization, hypothesis, led, to, significant, revisions, resulting, in, the, religious, transformation, hypothesis, this, perspective, holds, that, general, trends, towards, individualism, and, social, disintegration, will, produce, changes, in, religion, making, religious, practice, more, individualized, and, spiritually, focused, this, in, turn, is, expected, to, produce, more, spiritual, seeking, although, not, exclusive, to, religious, institutions, eclecticism, which, draws, from, multiple, religious, spiritual, systems, and, new, age, movements, are, also, predicted, to, result, in, response, to, the, religious, transformation, hypothesis, ronald, inglehart, piloted, the, renewal, of, the, secularization, hypothesis, his, argument, hinges, on, the, premise, that, religion, develops, to, fill, the, human, need, for, security, therefore, the, development, of, social, and, economic, security, in, europe, explains, its, corresponding, secularization, due, to, a, lack, of, need, for, religion, however, religion, continues, in, the, third, world, where, social, and, economic, insecurity, is, rampant, the, overall, effect, is, expected, to, be, a, growing, cultural, disparity, the, idea, that, religiosity, arises, from, the, human, need, for, security, has, also, been, furthered, by, studies, examining, religious, beliefs, as, a, compensatory, mechanism, of, control, these, studies, are, motivated, by, the, idea, that, people, are, invested, in, maintaining, beliefs, in, order, and, structure, to, prevent, beliefs, in, chaos, and, randomness, in, the, experimental, setting, researchers, have, also, tested, compensatory, control, in, regard, to, individuals, perceptions, of, external, systems, such, as, religion, or, government, for, example, kay, and, colleagues, found, that, in, a, laboratory, setting, individuals, are, more, likely, to, endorse, broad, external, systems, e, g, religion, or, sociopolitical, systems, that, impose, order, and, control, on, their, lives, when, they, are, induced, with, lowered, levels, of, personal, control, in, this, study, researchers, suggest, that, when, a, person, s, personal, control, is, lessened, their, motivation, to, believe, in, order, is, threatened, resulting, in, compensation, of, this, threat, through, adherence, to, other, external, sources, of, control, since, the, 1960s, psychologists, of, religion, have, used, the, methodology, of, psychometrics, to, assess, ways, in, which, a, person, may, be, religious, an, example, is, the, religious, orientation, scale, of, allport, and, ross, which, measures, how, respondents, stand, on, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, religion, as, described, by, allport, more, recent, questionnaires, include, the, age, universal, i, e, scale, of, gorsuch, and, venable, the, religious, life, inventory, of, batson, schoenrade, and, ventis, and, the, spiritual, experiences, index, revised, of, genia, the, first, provides, an, age, independent, measure, of, allport, and, ross, s, two, religious, orientations, the, second, measures, three, forms, of, religious, orientation, religion, as, means, intrinsic, religion, as, end, extrinsic, and, religion, as, quest, the, third, assesses, spiritual, maturity, using, two, factors, spiritual, support, and, spiritual, openness, some, questionnaires, such, as, the, religious, orientation, scale, relate, to, different, religious, orientations, such, as, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, religiousness, referring, to, different, motivations, for, religious, allegiance, a, rather, different, approach, taken, for, example, by, glock, and, stark, 1965, has, been, to, list, different, dimensions, of, religion, rather, than, different, religious, orientations, which, relates, to, how, an, individual, may, manifest, different, forms, of, being, religious, glock, and, stark, s, typology, described, five, dimensions, of, religion, the, doctrinal, the, intellectual, the, ethical, consequential, the, ritual, and, the, experiential, in, later, works, these, authors, subdivided, the, ritual, dimension, into, devotional, and, public, ritual, and, also, clarified, that, their, distinction, of, religion, along, multiple, dimensions, was, not, identical, to, distinguishing, religious, orientations, although, some, psychologists, of, religion, have, found, it, helpful, to, take, a, multidimensional, approach, to, religion, for, the, purpose, of, psychometric, scale, design, there, has, been, as, wulff, explains, considerable, controversy, about, whether, religion, should, really, be, seen, as, multidimensional, what, we, call, religious, experiences, can, differ, greatly, some, reports, exist, of, supernatural, happenings, that, it, would, be, difficult, to, explain, from, a, rational, scientific, point, of, view, on, the, other, hand, there, also, exist, the, sort, of, testimonies, that, simply, seem, to, convey, a, feeling, of, peace, or, oneness, something, which, most, of, us, religious, or, not, may, possibly, relate, to, in, categorizing, religious, experiences, it, is, perhaps, helpful, to, look, at, them, as, explicable, through, one, of, two, theories, the, objectivist, thesis, or, the, subjectivist, thesis, an, objectivist, would, argue, that, the, religious, experience, is, a, proof, of, god, s, existence, however, others, have, criticised, the, reliability, of, religious, experiences, the, english, philosopher, thomas, hobbes, asked, how, it, was, possible, to, tell, the, difference, between, talking, to, god, in, a, dream, and, dreaming, about, talking, to, god, the, subjectivist, view, argues, that, it, is, not, necessary, to, think, of, religious, experiences, as, evidence, for, the, existence, of, an, actual, being, whom, we, call, god, from, this, point, of, view, the, important, thing, is, the, experience, itself, and, the, effect, that, it, has, on, the, individual, many, have, looked, at, stage, models, like, those, of, jean, piaget, and, lawrence, kohlberg, to, explain, how, children, develop, ideas, about, god, and, religion, in, general, the, best, known, stage, model, of, spiritual, or, religious, development, is, that, of, james, w, fowler, a, developmental, psychologist, at, the, candler, school, of, theology, in, his, stages, of, faith, he, follows, piaget, and, kohlberg, and, has, proposed, a, holistic, staged, development, of, faith, or, spiritual, development, across, the, lifespan, these, stages, of, faith, development, were, along, the, lines, of, piaget, s, theory, of, cognitive, development, and, kohlberg, s, stages, of, moral, development, the, book, length, study, contains, six, stages, of, faith, development, proposed, by, james, fowler, fowler, s, model, has, inspired, a, considerable, body, of, empirical, research, into, faith, development, although, little, of, such, research, was, ever, conducted, by, fowler, himself, gary, leak, s, faith, development, scale, fds, has, been, subject, to, factor, analysis, by, leak, other, theorists, in, developmental, psychology, have, suggested, that, religiosity, comes, naturally, to, young, children, specifically, children, may, have, a, natural, born, conception, of, mind, body, dualism, which, lends, itself, to, beliefs, that, the, mind, may, live, on, after, the, body, dies, in, addition, children, have, a, tendency, to, see, agency, and, human, design, where, there, is, not, and, prefer, a, creationist, explanation, of, the, world, even, when, raised, by, parents, who, do, not, researchers, have, also, investigated, attachment, system, dynamics, as, a, predictor, of, the, religious, conversion, experience, throughout, childhood, and, adolescence, one, hypothesis, is, the, correspondence, hypothesis, which, posits, that, individuals, with, secure, parental, attachment, are, more, likely, to, experience, a, gradual, conversion, experience, under, the, correspondence, hypothesis, internal, working, models, of, a, person, s, attachment, figure, is, thought, to, perpetuate, his, or, her, perception, of, god, as, a, secure, base, another, hypothesis, relating, attachment, style, to, the, conversion, experience, is, the, compensation, hypothesis, which, states, that, individuals, with, insecure, attachments, are, more, likely, to, have, a, sudden, conversion, experience, as, they, compensate, for, their, insecure, attachment, relationship, by, seeking, a, relationship, with, god, researchers, have, tested, these, hypotheses, using, longitudinal, studies, and, individuals, self, narratives, of, their, conversion, experience, for, example, one, study, investigating, attachment, styles, and, adolescent, conversions, at, young, life, religious, summer, camps, resulted, in, evidence, supporting, the, correspondence, hypothesis, through, analysis, of, personal, narratives, and, a, prospective, longitudinal, follow, up, of, young, life, campers, with, mixed, results, for, the, compensation, hypothesis, james, alcock, summarizes, a, number, of, components, of, what, he, calls, the, god, engine, a, number, of, automatic, processes, and, cognitive, biases, combine, to, make, supernatural, belief, the, automatic, default, these, include, magical, thinking, agency, detection, theory, of, mind, that, leads, to, dualism, the, notion, that, objects, and, events, an, intentional, purpose, etc, evolutionary, psychology, is, based, on, the, hypothesis, that, just, like, the, cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and, immune, systems, cognition, has, a, functional, structure, with, a, genetic, basis, and, therefore, appeared, through, natural, selection, like, other, organs, and, tissues, this, functional, structure, should, be, universally, shared, among, humans, and, should, solve, important, problems, of, survival, and, reproduction, evolutionary, psychologists, seek, to, understand, cognitive, processes, by, understanding, the, survival, and, reproductive, functions, they, might, serve, pascal, boyer, is, one, of, the, leading, figures, in, the, cognitive, psychology, of, religion, a, new, field, of, inquiry, that, is, less, than, fifteen, years, old, which, accounts, for, the, psychological, processes, that, underlie, religious, thought, and, practice, in, his, book, religion, explained, boyer, shows, that, there, is, no, simple, explanation, for, religious, consciousness, boyer, is, mainly, concerned, with, explaining, the, various, psychological, processes, involved, in, the, acquisition, and, transmission, of, ideas, concerning, the, gods, boyer, builds, on, the, ideas, of, cognitive, anthropologists, dan, sperber, and, scott, atran, who, first, argued, that, religious, cognition, represents, a, by, product, of, various, evolutionary, adaptations, including, folk, psychology, and, purposeful, violations, of, innate, expectations, about, how, the, world, is, constructed, for, example, bodiless, beings, with, thoughts, and, emotions, that, make, religious, cognitions, striking, and, memorable, religious, persons, acquire, religious, ideas, and, practices, through, social, exposure, the, child, of, a, zen, buddhist, will, not, become, an, evangelical, christian, or, a, zulu, warrior, without, the, relevant, cultural, experience, while, mere, exposure, does, not, cause, a, particular, religious, outlook, a, person, may, have, been, raised, a, roman, catholic, but, leave, the, church, nevertheless, some, exposure, seems, required, this, person, will, never, invent, roman, catholicism, out, of, thin, air, boyer, says, cognitive, science, can, help, us, to, understand, the, psychological, mechanisms, that, account, for, these, manifest, correlations, and, in, so, doing, enable, us, to, better, understand, the, nature, of, religious, belief, and, practice, boyer, moves, outside, the, leading, currents, in, mainstream, cognitive, psychology, and, suggests, that, we, can, use, evolutionary, biology, to, unravel, the, relevant, mental, architecture, our, brains, are, after, all, biological, objects, and, the, best, naturalistic, account, of, their, development, in, nature, is, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, to, the, extent, that, mental, architecture, exhibits, intricate, processes, and, structures, it, is, plausible, to, think, that, this, is, the, result, of, evolutionary, processes, working, over, vast, periods, of, time, like, all, biological, systems, the, mind, is, optimised, to, promote, survival, and, reproduction, in, the, evolutionary, environment, on, this, view, all, specialised, cognitive, functions, broadly, serve, those, reproductive, ends, for, steven, pinker, the, universal, propensity, toward, religious, belief, is, a, genuine, scientific, puzzle, he, thinks, that, adaptationist, explanations, for, religion, do, not, meet, the, criteria, for, adaptations, an, alternative, explanation, is, that, religious, psychology, is, a, by, product, of, many, parts, of, the, mind, that, originally, evolved, for, other, purposes, religious, practice, often, manifests, itself, in, some, form, of, prayer, recent, studies, have, focused, specifically, on, the, effects, of, prayer, on, health, measures, of, prayer, and, the, above, measures, of, spirituality, evaluate, different, characteristics, and, should, not, be, considered, synonymous, prayer, is, fairly, prevalent, in, the, united, states, about, 55, of, americans, report, praying, daily, however, the, practice, of, prayer, is, more, prevalent, and, practiced, more, consistently, among, americans, who, perform, other, religious, practices, there, are, four, primary, types, of, prayer, in, the, west, poloma, and, pendleton, utilized, factor, analysis, to, delineate, these, four, types, of, prayer, meditative, more, spiritual, silent, thinking, ritualistic, reciting, petitionary, making, requests, to, god, and, colloquial, general, conversing, with, god, further, scientific, study, of, prayer, using, factor, analysis, has, revealed, three, dimensions, of, prayer, ladd, and, spilka, s, first, factor, was, awareness, of, self, inward, reaching, their, second, and, third, factors, were, upward, reaching, toward, god, and, outward, reaching, toward, others, this, study, appears, to, support, the, contemporary, model, of, prayer, as, connection, whether, to, the, self, higher, being, or, others, dein, and, littlewood, 2008, suggest, that, an, individual, s, prayer, life, can, be, viewed, on, a, spectrum, ranging, from, immature, to, mature, a, progression, on, the, scale, is, characterized, by, a, change, in, the, perspective, of, the, purpose, of, prayer, rather, than, using, prayer, as, a, means, of, changing, the, reality, of, a, situation, a, more, mature, individual, will, use, prayer, to, request, assistance, in, coping, with, immutable, problems, and, draw, closer, to, god, or, others, this, change, in, perspective, has, been, shown, to, be, associated, with, an, individual, s, passage, through, adolescence, prayer, appears, to, have, health, implications, empirical, studies, suggest, that, mindfully, reading, and, reciting, the, psalms, from, scripture, can, help, a, person, calm, down, and, focus, prayer, is, also, positively, correlated, with, happiness, and, religious, satisfaction, a, study, conducted, by, francis, robbins, lewis, and, barnes, investigated, the, relationship, between, self, reported, prayer, frequency, and, measures, of, psychoticism, and, neuroticism, according, to, the, abbreviated, form, of, the, revised, eysenck, personality, questionnaire, epqr, a, the, study, included, a, sample, size, of, 2306, students, attending, protestant, and, catholic, schools, in, the, highly, religious, culture, of, northern, ireland, the, data, shows, a, negative, correlation, between, prayer, frequency, and, psychoticism, the, data, also, shows, that, in, catholic, students, frequent, prayer, has, a, positive, correlation, to, neuroticism, scores, ladd, and, mcintosh, suggest, that, prayer, related, behaviors, such, as, bowing, the, head, and, clasping, the, hands, together, in, an, almost, fetal, position, are, suggestive, of, social, touch, actions, prayer, in, this, manner, may, prepare, an, individual, to, carry, out, positive, pro, social, behavior, after, praying, due, to, factors, such, as, increased, blood, flow, to, the, head, and, nasal, breathing, overall, slight, health, benefits, have, been, found, fairly, consistently, across, studies, three, main, pathways, to, explain, this, trend, have, been, offered, placebo, effect, focus, and, attitude, adjustment, and, activation, of, healing, processes, these, offerings, have, been, expanded, by, breslin, and, lewis, 2008, who, have, constructed, a, five, pathway, model, between, prayer, and, health, with, the, following, mediators, physiological, psychological, placebo, social, support, and, spiritual, the, spiritual, mediator, is, a, departure, from, the, rest, in, that, its, potential, for, empirical, investigation, is, not, currently, feasible, although, the, conceptualizations, of, chi, the, universal, mind, divine, intervention, and, the, like, breach, the, boundaries, of, scientific, observation, they, are, included, in, this, model, as, possible, links, between, prayer, and, health, so, as, to, not, unnecessarily, exclude, the, supernatural, from, the, broader, conversation, of, psychology, and, religion, another, significant, form, of, religious, practice, is, ritual, religious, rituals, encompass, a, wide, array, of, practices, but, can, be, defined, as, the, performance, of, similar, actions, and, vocal, expressions, based, on, prescribed, tradition, and, cultural, norms, scheff, suggests, that, ritual, provides, catharsis, emotional, purging, through, distancing, this, emotional, distancing, enables, an, individual, to, experience, feelings, with, an, amount, of, separation, and, thus, with, less, intensity, however, the, conception, of, religious, ritual, as, an, interactive, process, has, since, matured, and, become, more, scientifically, established, from, this, view, ritual, offers, a, means, to, catharsis, through, behaviors, that, foster, connection, with, others, allowing, for, emotional, expression, this, focus, on, connection, contrasts, to, the, separation, that, seems, to, underlie, scheff, s, view, additional, research, suggests, a, social, component, of, ritual, for, instance, findings, suggest, that, ritual, performance, indicates, group, commitment, and, prevents, the, uncommitted, from, gaining, membership, benefits, ritual, may, aid, in, emphasizing, moral, values, that, serve, as, group, norms, and, regulate, societies, it, may, also, strengthen, commitment, to, moral, convictions, and, the, likelihood, of, upholding, these, social, expectations, thus, performance, of, rituals, may, foster, social, group, stability, robert, sapolsky, sees, a, similarity, between, the, rituals, accompanying, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, and, religious, rituals, according, to, him, religious, ritual, reduces, the, tension, and, anxiety, associated, with, the, disorder, and, provides, relief, resulting, from, practicing, in, a, social, community, there, is, considerable, literature, on, the, relationship, between, religion, and, health, more, than, 3000, empirical, studies, have, examined, relationships, between, religion, and, health, including, more, than, 1200, in, the, 20th, century, and, more, than, 2000, additional, studies, between, 2000, and, 2009, psychologists, consider, that, religion, may, benefit, both, physical, and, mental, health, in, various, ways, including, encouraging, healthy, lifestyles, providing, social, support, networks, and, encouraging, an, optimistic, outlook, on, life, prayer, and, meditation, may, also, benefit, physiological, functioning, nevertheless, religion, is, not, a, unique, source, of, health, and, well, being, and, there, are, benefits, to, nonreligiosity, as, well, haber, jacob, and, spangler, have, considered, how, different, dimensions, of, religiosity, may, relate, to, health, benefits, in, different, ways, some, studies, have, examined, whether, there, is, a, religious, personality, research, on, the, five, factor, model, of, personality, suggests, that, people, who, identify, as, religious, are, more, likely, to, be, agreeable, and, conscientious, similarly, people, who, identify, as, spiritual, are, more, likely, to, be, extrovert, and, open, although, this, varies, based, on, the, type, of, spirituality, endorsed, for, example, people, endorsing, fundamentalist, religious, beliefs, are, more, likely, to, measure, low, on, the, openness, factor, to, investigate, the, salience, of, religious, beliefs, in, establishing, group, identity, researchers, have, also, conducted, studies, looking, at, religion, and, prejudice, some, studies, have, shown, that, greater, religious, attitudes, may, be, significant, predictors, of, negative, attitudes, towards, racial, or, social, outgroups, these, effects, are, often, conceptualized, under, the, framework, of, intergroup, bias, where, religious, individuals, favor, members, of, their, ingroup, ingroup, favoritism, and, exhibit, disfavor, towards, members, of, their, outgroup, outgroup, derogation, evidence, supporting, religious, intergroup, bias, has, been, supported, in, multiple, religious, groups, including, non, christian, groups, and, is, thought, to, reflect, the, role, of, group, dynamics, in, religious, identification, many, studies, regarding, religion, and, prejudice, implement, religious, priming, both, in, the, laboratory, and, in, naturalistic, settings, with, evidence, supporting, the, perpetuation, of, ingroup, favoritism, and, outgroup, derogation, in, individuals, who, are, high, in, religiosity, recently, reparative, or, conversion, therapy, a, religiously, motivated, process, intended, to, change, an, individual, s, sexuality, has, been, the, subject, of, scrutiny, and, has, been, condemned, by, some, governments, lgbt, charities, and, therapy, counselling, professional, bodies, the, american, psychologist, james, h, leuba, 1868, 1946, in, a, psychological, study, of, religion, accounts, for, mystical, experience, psychologically, and, physiologically, pointing, to, analogies, with, certain, drug, induced, experiences, leuba, argued, forcibly, for, a, naturalistic, treatment, of, religion, which, he, considered, to, be, necessary, if, religious, psychology, were, to, be, looked, at, scientifically, shamans, all, over, the, world, and, in, different, cultures, have, traditionally, used, drugs, especially, psychedelics, for, their, religious, experiences, in, these, communities, the, absorption, of, drugs, leads, to, dreams, visions, through, sensory, distortion, the, psychedelic, experience, is, often, compared, to, non, ordinary, forms, of, consciousness, such, as, those, experienced, in, meditation, and, mystical, experiences, ego, dissolution, is, often, described, as, a, key, feature, of, the, psychedelic, experience, william, james, was, also, interested, in, mystical, experiences, from, a, drug, induced, perspective, leading, him, to, make, some, experiments, with, nitrous, oxide, and, even, peyote, he, concludes, that, while, the, revelations, of, the, mystic, hold, true, they, hold, true, only, for, the, mystic, for, others, they, are, certainly, ideas, to, be, considered, but, hold, no, claim, to, truth, without, personal, experience, of, such, although, many, researchers, have, brought, evidence, for, a, positive, role, that, religion, plays, in, health, others, have, shown, that, religious, beliefs, practices, and, experiences, may, be, linked, to, mental, illnesses, of, various, kinds, mood, disorders, personality, disorders, and, psychiatric, disorders, in, 2012, a, team, of, psychiatrists, behavioral, psychologists, neurologists, and, neuropsychiatrists, from, the, harvard, medical, school, published, research, which, suggested, the, development, of, a, new, diagnostic, category, of, psychiatric, disorders, related, to, religious, delusion, and, hyperreligiosity, they, compared, the, thoughts, and, behaviors, of, the, most, important, figures, in, the, bible, abraham, moses, jesus, christ, and, paul, with, patients, affected, by, mental, disorders, related, to, the, psychotic, spectrum, using, different, clusters, of, disorders, and, diagnostic, criteria, dsm, iv, tr, and, concluded, that, these, biblical, figures, may, have, had, psychotic, symptoms, that, contributed, inspiration, for, their, revelations, such, as, schizophrenia, schizoaffective, disorder, manic, depression, delusional, disorder, delusions, of, grandeur, auditory, visual, hallucinations, paranoia, geschwind, syndrome, paul, especially, and, abnormal, experiences, associated, with, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, tle, the, authors, suggest, that, jesus, sought, to, condemn, himself, to, death, suicide, by, proxy, the, research, went, further, and, also, focused, on, social, models, of, psychopathology, analyzing, new, religious, movements, and, charismatic, cult, leaders, such, as, david, koresh, leader, of, the, branch, davidians, and, marshall, applewhite, founder, of, the, heaven, s, gate, cult, the, researchers, concluded, that, if, david, koresh, and, marshall, applewhite, are, appreciated, as, having, psychotic, spectrum, beliefs, then, the, premise, becomes, untenable, that, the, diagnosis, of, psychosis, must, rigidly, rely, upon, an, inability, to, maintain, a, social, group, a, subset, of, individuals, with, psychotic, symptoms, appears, able, to, form, intense, social, bonds, and, communities, despite, having, an, extremely, distorted, view, of, reality, the, existence, of, a, better, socially, functioning, subset, of, individuals, with, psychotic, type, symptoms, is, corroborated, by, research, indicating, that, psychotic, like, experiences, including, both, bizarre, and, non, bizarre, delusion, like, beliefs, are, frequently, found, in, the, general, population, this, supports, the, idea, that, psychotic, symptoms, likely, lie, on, a, continuum, clients, religious, beliefs, are, increasingly, being, considered, in, psychotherapy, with, the, goal, of, improving, service, and, effectiveness, of, treatment, a, resulting, development, was, theistic, psychotherapy, conceptually, it, consists, of, theological, principles, a, theistic, view, of, personality, and, a, theistic, view, of, psychotherapy, following, an, explicit, minimizing, strategy, therapists, attempt, to, minimize, conflict, by, acknowledging, their, religious, views, while, being, respectful, of, client, s, religious, views, this, is, argued, to, up, the, potential, for, therapists, to, directly, utilize, religious, practices, and, principles, in, therapy, such, as, prayer, forgiveness, and, grace, in, contrast, to, such, an, approach, psychoanalyst, robin, s, brown, argues, for, the, extent, to, which, our, spiritual, commitments, remain, unconscious, drawing, from, the, work, of, jung, brown, suggests, that, our, biases, can, only, be, suspended, in, the, extent, to, which, they, are, no, longer, our, biases, one, application, of, the, psychology, of, religion, is, in, pastoral, psychology, the, use, of, psychological, findings, to, improve, the, pastoral, care, provided, by, pastors, and, other, clergy, especially, in, how, they, support, ordinary, members, of, their, congregations, pastoral, psychology, is, also, concerned, with, improving, the, practice, of, chaplains, in, healthcare, and, in, the, military, one, major, concern, of, pastoral, psychology, is, to, improve, the, practice, of, pastoral, counseling, pastoral, psychology, is, a, topic, of, interest, for, professional, journals, such, as, the, journal, of, psychology, and, christianity, and, the, journal, of, psychology, and, theology, in, 1984, thomas, oden, severely, criticized, mid, 20th, century, pastoral, care, and, the, pastoral, psychology, that, guided, it, as, having, entirely, abandoned, its, classical, traditional, sources, and, having, become, overwhelmingly, dominated, by, modern, psychological, influences, from, freud, rogers, and, others, more, recently, others, have, described, pastoral, psychology, as, a, field, that, experiences, a, tension, between, psychology, and, theology
