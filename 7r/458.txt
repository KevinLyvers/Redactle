as, liangguang, the, term, cantonese, is, often, used, to, refer, to, the, whole, branch, but, linguists, prefer, to, reserve, the, name, cantonese, for, the, variety, used, in, guangzhou, canton, wuzhou, ngchow, hong, kong, and, macau, which, is, the, prestige, dialect, of, the, group, taishanese, from, the, coastal, area, of, jiangmen, kongmoon, located, southwest, of, guangzhou, was, the,

mutually, intelligible, with, other, varieties, of, chinese, and, they, are, not, mutually, intelligible, within, the, yue, family, either, they, are, among, the, most, conservative, varieties, with, regard, to, the, final, consonants, and, tonal, categories, of, middle, chinese, but, have, lost, several, distinctions, in, the, initial, consonants, and, medial, glides, that, other, chinese, varieties, have, retained, cantonese, is, prototypically, used, in, english, to, refer, to, the, variety, of, yue, in, guangzhou, but, it, is, also, to, refer, to, yue, as, a, whole, to, avoid, confusion, academic, texts, may, refer, to, the, larger, branch, as, yue, following, the, pinyin, system, based, on, standard, chinese, and, either, restrict, cantonese, to, the, guangzhou, variety, or, avoid, the, term, altogether, distinguishing, yue, from, its, guangzhou, dialect, people, from, hong, kong, and, macau, as, well, as, cantonese, immigrants, abroad, generally, refer, to, their,

expression, n, ahmn, hng, baahkw, means, nanning, colloquial, speech, the, area, of, china, south, of, the, nanling, mountains, known, as, the, lingnan, roughly, modern, guangxi, and, guangdong, was, originally, home, to, peoples, known, to, the, chinese, as, the, hundred, yue, or, baiyue, large, scale, han, chinese, migration, to, the, area, began, after, the, qin, conquest, of, the, region, in, 214, bc, successive, waves, of, immigration, followed, at, times, of, upheaval, in, northern, and, central, china, such, as, the, collapse, of, the, han, tang, and, song, dynasties, the, most, popular, route, was, via, the, xiang, river, which, the, qin, had, connected, to, the, li, river, by, the, lingqu, canal, and, then, into, the, valley, of, the, xi, jiang, a, secondary, route, followed, the, gan, river, and, then, the, bei, jiang, into, eastern, guangdong, yue, speakers, were, later, joined, by, hakka, speakers, following, the, north, river, route, and, min, speakers, arriving, by, sea, after, the, fall, of, qin, the, lingnan, area, was, part, of, the, independent, state, of, nanyue, for, about, a, century, before, being, incorporated, into, the, han, empire, in, 111, bc, after, the, tang, dynasty, collapsed, much, of, the, area, became, part, of, the, state, of, southern, han, one, of, the, longest, lived, states, of, the, five, dynasties, and, ten, kingdoms, between, 917, and, 971, large, waves, of, chinese, migration, throughout, succeeding, chinese, dynasties, assimilated, huge, numbers, of, yue, aborigines, with, the, result, that, today, s, southern, han, chinese, yue, speaking, population, is, descended, from, both, groups, the, colloquial, layers, of, yue, varieties, contain, elements, influenced, by, the, tai, languages, formerly, spoken, widely, in, the, area, and, still, spoken, by, people, such, as, the, zhuang, and, dong, the, port, city, of, guangzhou, lies, in, the, middle, of, pearl, river, delta, with, access, to, the, interior, via, the, xi, bei, and, dong, rivers, which, all, converge, at, the, delta, it, has, been, the, economic, centre, of, the, lingnan, region, since, qin, times, when, it, was, an, important, shipbuilding, centre, by, 660, it, was, the, largest, port, in, china, part, of, a, trade, network, stretching, as, far, as, arabia, during, the, southern, song, it, also, became, the, cultural, centre, of, the, region, like, many, other, chinese, varieties, it, developed, a, distinct, literary, layer, associated, with, the, local, tradition, of, reading, the, classics, the, guangzhou, dialect, cantonese, was, used, in, the, popular, yu, u, m, y, and, n, ny, n, folksong, genres, as, well, as, cantonese, opera, there, was, also, a, small, amount, of, vernacular, literature, written, with, chinese, characters, extended, with, a, number, of, non, traditional, characters, for, cantonese, words, guangzhou, became, the, centre, of, rapidly, expanding, foreign, trade, after, the, maritime, ban, was, lifted, with, the, british, east, india, company, establishing, a, chamber, of, commerce, in, the, city, in, 1715, the, ancestors, of, most, of, the, han, chinese, population, of, hong, kong, came, from, guangzhou, after, the, territory, was, ceded, to, britain, in, 1842, as, a, result, hong, kong, cantonese, the, most, widely, spoken, language, in, hong, kong, and, macau, is, an, offshoot, of, the, guangzhou, dialect, the, popularity, of, cantonese, language, media, cantopop, and, the, cinema, of, hong, kong, has, since, led, to, substantial, exposure, of, cantonese, to, china, and, the, rest, of, asia, on, the, mainland, the, national, policy, is, to, promote, standard, chinese, which, is, also, the, medium, of, instruction, in, schools, the, place, of, local, cantonese, language, and, culture, remains, contentious, in, 2010, a, controversial, proposal, to, switch, some, programming, on, guangzhou, local, television, from, cantonese, to, mandarin, was, abandoned, following, widespread, backlash, accompanied, by, public, protests, yue, languages, are, spoken, in, the, southern, provinces, of, guangdong, and, guangxi, an, area, long, dominated, culturally, and, economically, by, the, city, of, guangzhou, at, the, delta, of, the, pearl, river, cantonese, also, spoken, in, hong, kong, and, macau, is, the, prestige, variety, of, yue, the, influence, of, guangzhou, has, spread, westward, along, the, pearl, river, system, so, that, for, example, the, speech, of, the, city, of, wuzhou, some, 190, km, 120, mi, upstream, in, guangxi, is, much, more, similar, to, that, of, guangzhou, than, dialects, of, coastal, districts, that, are, closer, but, separated, from, the, city, by, hilly, terrain, one, of, these, coastal, languages, taishanese, is, the, most, common, yue, variety, among, overseas, communities, yue, varieties, are, not, totally, mutually, intelligible, with, one, another, yue, chinese, is, the, most, widely, spoken, local, language, in, guangdong, its, native, speakers, constitute, around, a, half, 47, of, its, population, the, other, half, is, equally, divided, between, hakka, and, min, chinese, mostly, teochew, but, also, leizhounese, yue, is, also, the, most, widespread, sinitic, language, in, guangxi, spoken, by, slightly, more, than, a, half, of, its, han, population, the, other, half, is, almost, equally, divided, between, the, southwestern, mandarin, hakka, and, pinghua, there, is, also, a, considerable, xiang, speaking, population, and, a, small, hokkien, speaking, minority, yue, chinese, is, spoken, by, 35, of, the, total, population, of, guangxi, being, one, of, the, two, largest, languages, in, that, province, along, with, zhuang, in, china, as, of, 2004, 60, of, all, yue, speakers, lived, in, guangdong, 28, 3, lived, in, guangxi, and, 11, 6, lived, in, hong, kong, in, yuan, jiahua, s, 1962, dialect, manual, yue, dialects, were, divided, into, five, groups, in, the, language, atlas, of, china, some, varieties, spoken, in, western, guangxi, formerly, classified, as, yue, are, placed, in, a, separate, pinghua, group, the, remaining, yue, dialects, are, divided, into, seven, groups, three, groups, are, found, in, the, watershed, of, the, pearl, river, the, remaining, four, groups, are, found, in, coastal, areas, anne, yue, hashimoto, has, proposed, an, alternative, classification, based, on, a, wider, sampling, of, features, the, dapeng, dialect, is, a, variety, displaying, features, of, both, cantonese, and, hakka, spoken, by, 3, 000, 5, 500, people, in, dapeng, shenzhen, the, guangzhou, canton, dialect, of, yuehai, usually, called, cantonese, is, the, prestige, dialect, of, guangdong, province, and, social, standard, of, yue, it, is, the, most, widely, spoken, dialect, of, yue, and, is, an, official, language, of, hong, kong, and, of, macau, alongside, english, and, portuguese, respectively, it, is, the, lingua, franca, of, not, only, guangdong, but, also, many, overseas, cantonese, emigrants, though, in, many, areas, abroad, it, is, numerically, second, to, the, taishanese, dialect, of, yue, by, law, standard, chinese, based, on, the, beijing, dialect, of, mandarin, is, taught, nearly, universally, as, a, supplement, to, local, languages, such, as, cantonese, in, guangzhou, much, of, the, distinctively, yue, vocabulary, have, been, replaced, with, cantonese, pronunciations, of, corresponding, standard, chinese, terms, cantonese, is, the, de, facto, official, language, of, hong, kong, along, with, english, and, macau, along, with, portuguese, though, legally, the, official, language, is, just, chinese, it, is, the, oral, language, of, instruction, in, chinese, schools, in, hong, kong, and, macau, and, is, used, extensively, in, cantonese, speaking, households, cantonese, language, media, hong, kong, films, television, serials, and, cantopop, which, exist, in, isolation, from, the, other, regions, of, china, local, identity, and, the, non, mandarin, speaking, cantonese, diaspora, in, hong, kong, and, abroad, give, the, language, a, unique, identity, colloquial, hong, kong, cantonese, often, incorporates, english, words, due, to, historical, british, influences, most, wuxia, films, from, canton, are, filmed, originally, in, cantonese, and, then, dubbed, or, subtitled, in, mandarin, english, or, both, when, the, chinese, government, removed, the, prohibition, on, emigration, in, the, mid, 19th, century, many, people, from, rural, areas, in, the, coastal, regions, of, fujian, and, guangdong, emigrated, to, southeast, asia, and, north, america, until, the, late, 20th, century, the, vast, majority, of, chinese, immigrants, to, north, america, came, from, the, siyi, four, counties, to, the, southwest, of, guangzhou, the, speech, of, this, region, particularly, the, taishan, dialect, is, thus, the, most, common, yue, variety, in, these, areas, it, is, only, partially, understood, by, speakers, of, cantonese, yue, varieties, are, among, the, most, conservative, of, chinese, varieties, regarding, the, final, consonants, and, tonal, categories, of, middle, chinese, so, that, the, rhymes, of, tang, poetry, are, clearer, in, yue, dialects, than, elsewhere, however, they, have, lost, several, distinctions, in, the, initial, consonants, and, medial, vowels, that, other, chinese, varieties, have, retained, in, addition, to, aspirated, and, unaspirated, voiceless, initials, middle, chinese, had, a, series, of, voiced, initials, but, voicing, has, been, lost, in, yue, and, most, other, modern, chinese, varieties, apart, from, wu, and, old, xiang, in, the, guangfu, siyi, and, gao, yang, subgroups, these, initials, have, yielded, aspirated, consonants, in, the, level, and, rising, tones, and, unaspirated, consonants, in, the, departing, and, entering, tones, these, initials, are, uniformly, unaspirated, in, gou, lou, varieties, and, uniformly, aspirated, in, wu, hua, in, many, yue, varieties, including, cantonese, middle, chinese, k, has, become, or, in, most, words, in, taishanese, t, has, also, changed, to, for, example, in, the, native, name, of, the, dialect, hoisan, in, siyi, and, eastern, gao, yang, middle, chinese, s, has, become, a, voiceless, lateral, fricative, most, yue, varieties, have, merged, the, middle, chinese, retroflex, sibilants, with, the, alveolar, sibilants, in, contrast, with, mandarin, dialects, which, have, generally, maintained, the, distinction, for, example, the, words, ji, ng, and, zh, ng, are, distinguished, in, mandarin, but, in, modern, cantonese, they, are, both, pronounced, as, j, ung, many, mandarin, varieties, including, the, beijing, dialect, have, a, third, sibilant, series, formed, through, a, merger, of, palatalized, alveolar, sibilants, and, velars, but, this, is, a, recent, innovation, which, has, not, affected, yue, and, other, chinese, varieties, for, example, and, are, all, pronounced, as, j, ng, in, mandarin, but, in, cantonese, the, first, pair, is, pronounced, j, ng, while, the, second, pair, is, pronounced, g, ng, the, earlier, pronunciation, is, reflected, in, historical, mandarin, romanizations, such, as, peking, for, beijing, kiangsi, for, jiangxi, and, tientsin, for, tianjin, some, yue, speakers, such, as, many, hong, kong, cantonese, speakers, born, after, world, war, ii, merge, n, with, l, but, taishanese, and, most, other, yue, varieties, preserve, the, distinction, younger, cantonese, speakers, also, tend, not, to, distinguish, between, and, the, zero, initial, though, this, distinction, is, retained, in, most, yue, dialects, yue, varieties, retain, the, initial, m, in, words, where, late, middle, chinese, shows, a, shift, to, a, labiodental, consonant, realized, in, most, northern, varieties, of, chinese, as, nasals, can, be, independent, syllables, in, yue, words, e, g, cantonese, gh, five, and, m, h, not, although, middle, chinese, did, not, have, syllables, of, this, type, in, most, yue, varieties, except, for, tengxian, the, rounded, medial, w, has, merged, with, the, following, vowel, to, form, a, monophthong, except, after, velar, initials, in, most, analyses, velars, followed, by, w, are, treated, as, labio, velars, most, yue, varieties, have, retained, the, middle, chinese, palatal, medial, but, in, cantonese, it, has, also, been, lost, to, monophthongization, yielding, a, variety, of, vowels, middle, chinese, syllables, could, end, with, glides, j, or, w, nasals, m, n, or, or, stops, p, t, or, k, syllables, with, vocalic, or, nasal, endings, could, occur, with, one, of, three, tonal, contours, called, level, rising, or, departing, syllables, with, final, stops, were, traditionally, treated, as, a, fourth, tone, category, the, entering, tone, r, because, the, stops, were, distributed, in, the, same, way, as, the, corresponding, final, nasals, while, northern, and, central, varieties, have, lost, some, of, the, middle, chinese, final, consonants, they, are, retained, by, most, southern, chinese, varieties, though, sometimes, affected, by, sound, shifts, they, are, most, faithfully, preserved, in, yue, dialects, final, stops, have, disappeared, entirely, in, most, mandarin, dialects, including, the, beijing, based, standard, with, the, syllables, distributed, across, the, other, tones, for, example, the, characters, and, are, all, pronounced, y, in, mandarin, but, they, are, all, distinct, in, yue, in, cantonese, yeuih, ngaht, ngaih, y, k, yihk, yi, yih, ai, y, p, and, yaht, respectively, similarly, in, mandarin, dialects, the, middle, chinese, final, m, has, merged, with, n, but, the, distinction, is, maintained, in, southern, varieties, of, chinese, such, as, hakka, min, and, yue, for, example, cantonese, has, taahm, and, t, ahn, versus, mandarin, t, n, y, hm, and, y, hn, versus, mandarin, y, n, t, m, and, t, n, versus, mandarin, ti, n, and, h, hm, and, h, hn, versus, mandarin, h, n, middle, chinese, is, described, in, contemporary, dictionaries, as, having, four, tones, where, the, fourth, category, the, entering, tone, consists, of, syllables, with, final, stops, many, modern, chinese, varieties, contain, traces, of, a, split, of, each, of, these, four, tones, into, two, registers, an, upper, or, y, n, register, from, voiceless, initials, and, a, lower, or, y, ng, register, from, voiced, initials, most, mandarin, dialects, retain, the, register, distinction, only, in, the, level, tone, yielding, the, first, and, second, tones, of, the, standard, language, corresponding, to, the, first, and, fourth, tones, in, cantonese, but, have, merged, several, of, the, other, categories, most, yue, dialects, have, retained, all, eight, categories, with, a, further, split, of, the, upper, entering, tone, conditioned, by, vowel, length, as, also, found, in, neighbouring, tai, dialects, a, few, dialects, spoken, in, guangxi, such, as, the, bobai, dialect, have, also, split, the, lower, entering, tone, while, most, chinese, varieties, form, compounds, consisting, of, a, qualifier, followed, by, a, qualified, element, yue, dialects, may, use, the, reverse, order, for, example, the, standard, chinese, and, widely, used, cantonese, word, for, guest, is, k, r, n, guest, person, but, the, same, morphemes, may, be, reversed, in, cantonese, versus, taishanese, and, tengxian, this, has, been, hypothesized, to, be, the, influence, of, tai, languages, in, which, modifiers, normally, follow, nouns, but, it, is, notable, that, the, standard, chinese, word, for, married, woman, also, follows, the, same, structure, gender, markers, for, nouns, are, also, suffixed, as, in, other, southern, varieties, some, yue, dialects, including, cantonese, can, use, the, same, word, b, n, go, which, one, for, both, who, and, which, other, dialects, including, taishanese, use, s, e, cf, mandarin, sh, i, for, who, and, words, meaning, which, one, for, which
