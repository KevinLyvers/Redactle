kelantanese, malay, but, the, language, has, no, official, status, or, recognition, owing, to, earlier, contact, with, the, philippines, malay, words, such, as, dalam, hati, sympathy, luwalhati, glory, tengah, hari, midday, sedap, delicious, have, evolved, and, been, integrated, into, tagalog, and, other, philippine, languages, by, contrast, indonesian, has, successfully, become, the, lingua, franca, for, its, disparate, islands, and, ethnic, groups, in, part, because, the, colonial, language, dutch, is, no, longer, commonly, spoken, in, east, timor, which, was, governed, as, a, province, of, indonesia, from, 1976, to, 1999, indonesian, is, widely, spoken, and, recognized, under, its, constitution, as, a, working, language, besides, indonesian, which, developed, from, the, malaccan,

ambonese, malay, north, moluccan, malay, kupang, malay, dili, malay, and, papuan, malay, the, differences, among, both, groups, are, quite, observable, for, example, the, word, kita, means, we, us, in, western, but, means, i, me, in, manado, whereas, we, us, in, manado, is, torang, and, ambon, katong, originally, abbreviated, from, malay, kita, orang, we, people, another, difference, is, the, lack, of, possessive, pronouns, and, suffixes, in, eastern, dialects, manado, uses, the, verb, pe, and, ambon, pu, from, malay, punya, to, have, to, mark, possession, so, my, name, and, our, house, are, translated, in, western, malay, as, namaku, and, rumah, kita, but, kita, pe, nama, and, torang, pe, rumah, in, manado, and, beta, pu, nama, katong, pu, rumah, in, ambon, dialect, the, pronunciation, may, vary, in, western, dialects, especially, the, pronunciation, of, words, ending, in, the, vowel, a, for, example, in, some, parts, of, malaysia, and, in, singapore, kita, inclusive, we, us, our, is, pronounced, as, kit, in, kelantan, and, southern, thailand, as, kit, in, riau, as, kita, in, palembang, as, kito, in, betawi, and, perak, as, kit, and, in, kedah, and, perlis, as, kit, batavian, and, eastern, dialects, are, sometimes, regarded, as, malay, creole, because, the, speakers, are, not, ethnically, malay, all, malay, speakers, should, be, able, to, understand, either, of, the, translations, below, which, differ, mostly, in, their, choice, of, wording, the, words, for, article, pasal, and, perkara, and, for, declaration, pernyataan, and, perisytiharan, are, specific, to, the, indonesian, and, malaysian, standards, respectively, but, otherwise, all, the, words, are, found, in, both, and, even, those, words, may, be, found, with, slightly, different, meanings, all, human, beings, are, born, free, and, have, the, same, dignity, and, rights, they, are, endowed, with, reason, and, conscience, and, should, get, along, with, each, other, in, a, spirit,
