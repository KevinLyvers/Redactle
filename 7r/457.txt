wu, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, w, y, wugniu, and, ipa, 6, wu, gniu, 6, shanghainese, 2, ghou, gniu, 6, suzhounese, is, a, major, group, of, sinitic, languages, spoken, primarily, in, shanghai, zhejiang, province, and, parts, of, jiangsu, province, especially, south, of, the, yangtze, river, which, makes, up, the, cultural, region, of, wu, the, wu, languages, are, at, times, simply, called, shanghainese, especially, when, introduced, to, foreigners, the, suzhounese, variety, was, the, prestige, dialect, of, wu, as, of, the, 19th, century, but, had, been, replaced, in, status, by, shanghainese, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, coinciding, with, a, period, of, rapid, language, change, in, the, city, the, languages, of, northern, wu, constitute, a, language, family, and, are, mutually, intelligible, with, each, other, while, those, of, southern, wu, neither, form, a, phylogenetic, language, family, nor, are, mutually, intelligible, with, each, other, historical, linguists, view, wu, of, great, significance, due, to, its, obviously, distinct, nature, the, wu, languages, typically, preserve, all, voiced, initials, of, medieval, chinese, as, well, as, the, checked, tone, in, the, form, of, a, glottal, stop, wu, varieties, also, have, noticably, unique, morphological, and, syntactic, innovations, as, well, as, lexicon, exclusively, found, in, the, wu, grouping, it, is, also, of, note, that, the, influential, linguist, chao, yuen, ren, was, a, native, speaker, of, changzhounese, a, variety, of, northern, wu, the, wu, varieties, especially, that, of, suzhou, are, traditionally, perceived, as, soft, in, the, ears, of, speakers, of, both, wu, and, non, wu, languages, leading, to, the, idiom, the, tender, speech, of, wu, speakers, of, wu, varieties, are, mostly, unaware, of, this, term, for, their, speech, since, the, classificatory, imposition, of, wu, used, in, linguistics, today, is, a, relatively, recent, coinage, saying, someone, speaks, wu, is, therefore, akin, to, saying, someone, speaks, a, romance, language, it, is, not, a, particularly, defined, entity, like, standard, mandarin, or, hochdeutsch, most, speakers, are, only, aware, of, their, local, variety, s, affinities, with, other, similarly, classified, varieties, and, will, generally, only, refer, to, their, local, wu, variety, rather, than, to, the, dialect, family, as, a, whole, this, is, typically, done, by, affixing, speech, to, a, location, s, endonym, for, example, wu, chinese, pronunciation, is, used, for, wenzhounese, affixing, is, also, common, and, more, typical, of, northern, wu, as, in, wugniu, ka, shin, ghae, o, for, the, jiaxing, variety, names, for, the, group, as, a, whole, include, it, is, believed, that, han, chinese, peoples, first, arrived, at, the, area, during, pre, dynastic, history, after, the, migrations, proceeding, the, upheaval, of, the, five, barbarians, the, vernacular, that, would, later, lead, to, modern, wu, chinese, started, taking, shape, though, the, court, language, of, jiankang, today, nanjing, was, still, noticably, different, to, that, of, the, commonfolk, a, second, migration, wave, during, the, southern, song, dynasty, this, time, to, lin, an, hangzhou, led, to, the, formation, of, the, modern, literary, layer, and, during, the, yuan, and, ming, dynasties, many, operatic, traditions, and, vernacular, texts, began, to, appear, later, during, the, qing, dynasty, missionaries, began, translating, the, bible, into, various, local, varieties, recording, the, exact, pronunciations, of, many, varieties, for, the, first, time, this, was, also, when, the, economic, boom, of, shanghai, happened, leading, to, its, urban, variety, becoming, the, prestige, variety, over, that, of, suzhou, the, 20th, century, marked, a, pivotal, moment, of, wu, linguistic, change, as, standard, mandarin, was, promoted, nation, wide, though, the, 21st, century, is, seeing, revival, efforts, for, many, wu, chinese, varieties, before, the, migration, of, the, han, chinese, peoples, the, jiangnan, region, was, inhabited, by, kra, dai, or, austroasiatic, peoples, which, were, dubbed, barbarians, by, the, early, chinese, according, to, traditional, history, taibo, of, wu, settled, in, the, area, during, the, shang, dynasty, bringing, along, a, large, section, of, the, population, and, chinese, administrative, practices, to, form, the, state, of, wu, the, majority, population, of, the, state, would, have, been, the, ancient, baiyue, peoples, who, had, very, different, customs, and, practices, compared, to, the, chinese, it, is, said, in, master, l, s, spring, and, autumn, annals, that, the, customs, and, languages, of, the, states, of, wu, and, yue, were, the, same, this, refers, not, just, to, the, baiyue, language, of, the, area, but, also, of, that, of, ancient, wu, a, sinitic, language, likely, only, used, by, the, nobility, the, northern, border, of, this, ancient, wu, language, is, at, the, huai, river, rather, than, the, yangtze, like, it, is, today, and, its, southern, limits, may, have, reached, as, far, as, fujian, as, proto, min, may, have, been, a, daughter, language, to, ancient, wu, though, this, is, not, fully, accepted, as, early, as, the, time, of, guo, pu, 275, 324, speakers, easily, perceived, differences, between, dialects, in, different, parts, of, china, including, the, area, where, ancient, wu, was, spoken, the, language, slowly, receded, from, the, north, due, to, growing, pressure, from, the, central, plains, until, its, northern, limit, was, set, near, the, yangtze, river, towards, the, end, of, the, western, jin, dynasty, note, however, that, due, to, the, fact, that, all, modern, wu, varieties, work, within, the, qieyun, system, this, old, chinese, dialect, cannot, be, the, primary, origin, of, wu, chinese, today, it, is, known, that, wu, languages, inherited, a, significant, number, of, loanwords, of, kra, dai, origin, a, study, of, the, variety, spoken, in, maqiao, a, suburb, of, shanghai, found, that, 126, out, of, around, a, thousand, lexical, items, surveyed, were, of, kra, dai, origin, terms, such, as, wugniu, 8, loq, su, 1, aubergine, are, also, shared, between, other, sinitic, languages, eg, teochew, peng, im, lag, 8, sou, 1, as, well, as, kra, dai, languages, cf, standard, zhuang, lwggwz, shared, terms, with, austroasiatic, languages, have, also, been, suggested, though, many, of, them, such, as, vietnamese, m, b, o, and, k, have, also, been, argued, to, be, areal, features, chinese, words, in, disguise, or, long, shots, though, sino, tibetan, kra, dai, austronesian, and, austroasiatic, are, mostly, considered, to, be, unrelated, to, each, other, laurent, sagart, has, proposed, some, possible, phylogenetic, affinities, specifically, tai, kadai, and, sino, tibetan, could, possibly, both, belong, to, the, sino, austronesian, language, family, not, to, be, confused, with, austroasiatic, due, to, a, scattering, of, cognates, between, their, ancestral, forms, and, there, is, also, some, albeit, much, more, tenuous, evidence, to, suggest, that, austroasiatic, should, also, be, included, however, his, views, are, but, one, among, competing, hypotheses, about, the, phylogeny, of, these, languages, and, is, not, widely, accepted, see, the, sino, austronesian, languages, article, for, some, further, detail, it, does, appear, that, wu, varieties, have, had, non, sinitic, influences, and, many, contain, words, cognate, with, those, of, other, languages, in, various, strata, these, words, however, are, few, and, far, between, and, wu, on, the, whole, is, most, strongly, influenced, by, other, chinese, languages, rather, than, any, other, linguistic, influence, this, period, is, bookended, by, two, major, migration, waves, into, the, wu, speaking, area, the, first, was, in, the, 4th, century, ce, from, primarily, the, mountains, of, shandong, whereas, the, second, happened, during, the, 12th, century, ce, and, originated, from, the, heluo, region, due, to, events, such, as, the, wu, hu, uprising, and, the, disaster, of, yongjia, during, the, western, jin, dynasty, collectively, known, as, the, upheaval, of, the, five, barbarians, the, imperial, court, from, the, heluo, region, along, with, a, large, migration, wave, from, the, north, that, lasted, 150, years, primarily, northern, jiangsu, and, much, of, shandong, entered, the, jiangnan, region, establishing, a, new, capital, at, jiankang, modern, day, nanjing, migrants, went, as, far, south, as, central, zhejiang, though, many, settled, in, the, geographically, less, challenging, areas, in, the, north, that, is, to, say, the, yangtze, delta, and, the, hangjiahu, plain, early, stages, of, this, period, of, change, was, likely, marked, by, diglossia, with, the, commonfolk, typically, speaking, ancient, wu, or, their, native, shandong, or, northern, jiangsu, chinese, and, the, nobility, both, new, migrants, and, old, aristocracy, typically, speaking, a, varity, not, dissimilar, to, that, of, early, medieval, luoyang, this, linguistic, situation, eventually, led, to, the, formation, of, modern, wu, with, many, early, coincidental, strata, that, are, hard, to, differentiate, today, it, is, unclear, as, to, when, exactly, the, language, of, the, baiyue, became, extinct, though, during, the, eastern, han, dynasty, kra, dai, words, were, recorded, in, the, everyday, vernacular, of, people, in, the, region, and, by, the, end, of, the, western, jin, the, common, language, of, the, region, was, sinitic, as, will, be, explained, below, as, early, as, the, eastern, wu, dynasty, commentators, criticized, the, speech, of, the, southern, aristocracy, ie, that, of, the, wu, speaking, areas, noting, that, it, is, neither, wu, sounding, nor, northern, however, evidence, suggests, that, the, primary, language, among, the, populace, was, in, fact, sinitic, although, not, one, that, was, perceived, as, civilized, this, possible, civilian, language, would, be, a, common, jiangdong, sinitic, language, as, is, seen, in, shishuo, xinyu, by, liu, yiqing, 403, 444, which, narrates, that, the, politican, wang, dao, 276, 339, learned, the, idiom, after, fleeing, in, jiankang, in, around, the, year, 308, the, book, of, wei, unflatteringly, compares, the, speech, of, jiangdong, to, the, calls, of, wild, animals, the, court, language, of, jiankang, would, not, have, been, the, civilian, wu, language, though, it, would, have, been, closely, related, this, would, also, mark, the, time, where, japanese, go, on, hepburn, go, on, pinyin, w, y, n, readings, were, loaned, and, it, is, accepted, that, these, readings, would, have, been, loaned, from, the, language, variety, of, medieval, jiankang, one, prominent, historical, speaker, of, the, medieval, wu, language, was, emperor, yangdi, of, the, sui, dynasty, and, his, empress, xiao, emperor, xuan, of, western, liang, a, member, of, emperor, wu, of, liang, s, court, was, empress, xiao, s, grandfather, and, he, most, likely, learned, wu, at, jiankang, it, is, also, noted, in, the, preface, of, the, qieyun, a, sui, dynasty, rime, dictionary, that, the, speech, of, wu, as, well, as, that, of, chu, is, at, times, too, soft, and, light, a, ballad, narrative, known, as, the, story, of, xue, rengui, crossing, the, sea, and, pacifying, liao, which, is, about, the, tang, dynasty, hero, xue, rengui, is, believed, to, have, been, written, in, the, suzhounese, after, the, an, lushan, rebellion, significant, migration, into, the, northern, wu, speaking, areas, occurred, which, some, believe, created, the, north, south, geographical, divide, we, see, today, yongjianese, a, variety, of, oujiang, wu, was, first, recorded, during, the, song, dynasty, yongjianese, is, the, variety, in, which, the, liushugu, by, dai, tong, 1200, 1285, is, written, this, treaty, of, calligraphy, was, published, in, 1320, after, the, jingkang, incident, the, imperial, capital, of, the, song, dynasty, was, moved, from, bianjing, modern, day, kaifeng, to, lin, an, hangzhou, starting, the, southern, song, period, this, also, coincided, with, a, large, migration, wave, mostly, from, the, heluo, region, a, strip, of, the, central, plains, south, of, the, yellow, river, that, roughly, stretches, from, luoyang, to, kaifeng, which, also, brought, a, language, that, was, not, only, phonologically, and, lexically, different, to, the, wu, chinese, of, the, time, but, was, syntactically, and, morphologically, distinct, as, well, this, old, mandarin, influence, manifested, in, the, form, of, the, modern, literary, layer, as, it, was, also, the, court, language, of, the, time, coblin, believes, that, this, literary, layer, is, also, the, origin, of, huai, chinese, unlike, the, previous, sections, the, historical, state, of, wu, after, the, mongol, conquest, of, china, is, surprisingly, clear, due, to, the, emergence, of, vernacular, texts, following, the, mongol, conquest, of, china, a, period, of, relative, stability, followed, and, vernacularism, started, being, further, embraced, this, is, evident, in, the, fact, that, chinese, opera, productions, including, those, of, both, the, northern, and, southern, wu, speaking, regions, started, using, their, local, varieties, rather, than, classical, chinese, as, was, the, norm, during, and, before, the, song, dynasty, the, t, on, hepburn, t, on, pinyin, t, ngy, n, pronunciations, introduced, during, the, japanese, kamakura, period, were, largely, rooted, in, the, vernacular, of, northern, zhejiang, at, around, the, end, of, the, song, dynasty, or, start, of, the, yuan, dynasty, despite, what, its, name, may, suggest, analyses, on, texts, of, the, time, reveal, stark, phonetic, differences, between, the, wu, of, today, and, that, of, the, 13th, century, the, ming, dynasty, saw, continued, development, of, local, operas, such, as, suzhou, pingtan, and, more, vernacular, texts, being, written, in, particular, the, contemporary, classic, chinese, novels, such, as, water, margin, are, believed, to, have, significant, lexical, and, syntactic, influence, from, hangzhounese, the, yuan, ming, transition, saw, a, tremendous, loss, of, life, in, the, jianghuai, area, due, to, events, such, as, the, red, turban, rebellions, the, hongwu, emperor, ordered, for, people, from, jiangnan, primarily, in, suzhou, songjiang, jiaxing, hangzhou, and, other, northern, wu, speaking, areas, to, resettle, the, now, depopulated, areas, in, modern, central, jiangsu, more, migration, happened, several, decades, later, to, avoid, wokou, pirates, these, migrations, are, believed, to, have, contributed, to, the, wu, like, features, in, western, huai, chinese, groups, such, as, tongtai, dialectal, differences, were, not, as, obvious, in, textual, sources, until, ming, times, and, thus, regional, linguistic, distinctions, were, only, seen, in, media, after, the, fall, of, the, yuan, these, differences, are, largely, found, in, musical, sources, such, as, historical, folk, songs, and, tanci, a, kind, of, ballad, or, lyric, poem, for, instance, the, shange, sh, ng, mountain, songs, a, collection, of, folk, songs, gathered, during, the, ming, dynasty, by, feng, menglong, in, southern, jiangsu, and, northern, zhejiang, where, northern, wu, is, today, spoken, shows, clear, signs, of, modern, wu, chinese, in, its, lexicon, other, ming, documents, that, are, either, written, in, wu, or, contain, parts, where, wu, is, used, include, these, works, contain, a, small, handful, of, unique, grammatical, features, some, of, which, are, not, found, in, contemporary, mandarin, classical, chinese, or, in, contemporary, wu, varieties, they, do, contain, many, of, the, unique, features, in, its, vocabulary, present, in, contemporary, wu, such, as, pronouns, but, clearly, indicate, that, not, all, of, the, earlier, unique, features, of, these, wu, varieties, were, carried, into, present, varieties, these, works, also, possess, a, number, of, characters, uniquely, formed, to, express, features, not, found, in, the, classical, language, and, used, some, common, characters, as, phonetic, loans, see, chinese, character, classification, to, express, other, uniquely, wu, vocabulary, a, 16th, century, text, called, the, wenqiji, w, nq, j, includes, a, chapter, called, gedi, xiangyin, that, records, the, local, pronunciations, of, terms, in, various, areas, unlike, the, qieyun, preface, it, separates, the, early, southwestern, mandarin, of, huguang, ie, that, of, chu, from, wu, chinese, the, chapter, records, typical, features, of, modern, wu, such, as, texts, in, the, early, qing, dynasty, remained, much, the, same, as, that, of, the, ming, dynasty, works, of, the, time, include, the, qingzhongpu, and, doupeng, xianhua, an, early, qing, baihua, novel, during, the, 18th, century, significant, lexical, shifts, away, from, that, seen, in, shange, took, place, many, sources, we, have, of, the, period, are, operatic, in, nature, representative, works, from, this, section, include, the, operas, especially, kunqu, operas, by, qian, decang, in, the, collection, zhuibaiqiu, and, the, legends, written, by, shen, qifeng, or, what, are, known, as, shenshi, sizhong, as, well, as, huge, numbers, of, tanci, ballads, from, the, late, qing, period, to, republican, china, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, long, form, vernacular, novels, or, such, as, the, sing, song, girls, of, shanghai, and, the, nine, tailed, turtle, started, appearing, both, above, examples, are, pornographic, in, nature, other, works, include, wu, speaking, writers, who, wrote, in, vernacular, mandarin, often, left, traces, of, their, native, varieties, in, their, works, as, can, be, found, in, guanchang, xianxing, ji, and, fubao, xiantan, works, in, this, period, also, saw, an, explosion, of, new, vocabulary, in, wu, dialects, to, describe, their, changing, world, this, clearly, reflects, the, great, social, changes, which, were, occurring, during, the, time, at, the, same, time, missionary, joseph, edkins, who, gathered, large, amounts, of, data, and, published, several, educational, works, on, shanghainese, as, well, as, bibles, in, shanghainese, and, a, few, other, major, wu, varieties, including, southern, wu, varieties, such, as, jinhuanese, and, wenzhounese, following, the, taiping, rebellion, many, migrants, from, mandarin, speaking, areas, migrated, into, the, wu, speaking, area, xuanzhou, wu, therefore, significantly, receded, which, is, reflected, in, the, fact, that, it, is, now, only, spoken, in, the, mountainous, highlands, of, southern, anhui, some, territorial, changes, and, stratification, occurred, primarily, near, the, yangtze, river, the, newly, arrived, huai, chinese, varieties, have, been, slowly, overtaking, the, suburban, and, rural, wu, varieties, for, instance, in, lishui, county, nanjing, prefecture, the, huai, variety, was, confined, inside, the, town, itself, until, the, 1960s, at, present, it, is, overtaking, the, wu, variety, even, in, rural, areas, several, important, proponents, of, vernacular, chinese, in, official, use, such, as, lu, xun, and, chao, yuen, ren, were, speakers, of, northern, wu, varieties, in, this, case, shaoxingese, and, changzhounese, respectively, wenzhounese, was, used, during, the, second, world, war, to, avoid, japanese, interception, after, the, founding, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, strong, promotion, of, mandarin, in, the, wu, speaking, region, yet, again, influenced, the, development, of, wu, chinese, curiously, wenzhounese, was, used, again, during, the, vietnam, war, to, avoid, enemy, comprehensibility, wu, varieties, were, gradually, excluded, from, most, modern, media, and, schools, with, the, influx, of, a, migrant, non, wu, speaking, population, the, near, total, conversion, of, public, media, and, organizations, to, the, exclusive, use, of, mandarin, as, well, as, certain, mandarin, promotion, measures, promotion, and, regularization, of, wu, languages, became, improbable, and, left, them, more, prone, to, mandarinization, in, 1992, students, in, shanghai, were, banned, from, speaking, shanghainese, at, all, times, on, campuses, as, of, now, wu, has, no, official, status, no, legal, protection, and, there, is, no, officially, sanctioned, romanization, it, is, not, uncommon, to, encounter, children, who, grew, up, with, a, regional, variant, of, mandarin, as, their, parent, tongue, with, little, or, no, fluency, in, a, wu, variety, at, all, this, led, to, a, step, up, in, the, preservation, and, documentation, of, wu, chinese, with, the, first, major, attempt, being, the, linguistic, atlas, of, chinese, dialects, which, surveyed, 2, 791, locations, across, the, nation, including, 121, wu, locations, an, increase, from, the, two, locations, in, pku, s, earlier, surveys, this, also, led, to, the, formation, of, an, elaborate, database, including, digital, recordings, of, all, locations, however, this, database, is, not, available, to, the, general, public, the, atlas, s, editor, cao, zhiyun, considers, many, of, these, languages, endangered, and, has, introduced, the, term, languages, in, danger, or, endangered, local, languages, to, raise, people, s, attention, to, the, issue, although, major, international, databases, such, as, glottolog, and, ethnologue, do, not, share, similar, sentiments, although, more, tv, programs, are, appearing, in, wu, varieties, they, are, no, longer, permitted, to, air, during, primetime, they, are, generally, more, playful, than, serious, and, many, of, these, shows, such, as, hangzhou, s, old, liutou, tells, you, the, news, provide, local, or, regional, news, in, the, variety, but, most, are, limited, to, fifteen, minutes, of, airtime, popular, video, sites, such, as, youku, and, tudou, also, host, a, variety, of, user, uploaded, audio, and, visual, media, in, many, wu, varieties, most, of, which, are, regional, tv, shows, although, some, are, user, created, songs, and, the, like, a, number, of, books, are, also, appearing, to, teach, people, how, to, speak, wu, varieties, such, as, suzhounese, and, shanghainese, the, latter, of, which, even, having, international, titles, today, popular, support, for, the, preservation, of, wu, languages, is, very, strong, while, feature, length, movies, such, as, b, for, busy, and, highly, successful, tv, shows, such, as, blossoms, shanghai, have, been, filmed, in, wu, varieties, in, both, aforementioned, cases, shanghainese, it, is, now, not, uncommon, to, see, advertisements, and, billboards, as, well, as, government, media, using, wu, chinese, written, in, non, ad, hoc, orthographies, wu, s, place, within, the, greater, scope, of, sinitic, languages, is, less, easily, typified, than, prototypically, northern, chinese, varieties, such, as, mandarin, or, prototypically, southern, chinese, varieties, such, as, cantonese, its, original, classification, along, with, the, other, sinitic, varieties, was, established, in, 1937, by, li, fang, kuei, whose, boundaries, more, or, less, have, remained, the, same, and, were, adopted, by, yuan, jiahua, in, his, influential, 1961, dialect, primer, these, limits, were, also, adopted, by, chao, yuen, ren, and, he, even, further, created, a, potential, proto, system, for, wu, using, the, several, varieties, included, in, these, boundaries, a, similar, attempt, was, attempted, by, william, l, ballard, though, with, significantly, fewer, localities, and, a, heavy, skew, towards, the, north, the, sole, basis, of, li, rong, s, classification, was, the, evolution, of, qieyun, system, voiced, stops, this, was, also, chao, s, only, necessary, and, sufficient, requirement, for, a, variety, to, be, wu, this, definition, is, problematic, considering, the, devoicing, process, has, occurred, in, many, southern, wu, varieties, and, in, northern, wu, varieties, situated, near, huai, chinese, it, furthermore, would, place, unrelated, varieties, such, as, old, xiang, in, this, category, and, also, includes, hangzhounese, despite, its, linguistically, complex, situation, therefore, more, elaborate, systems, have, developed, but, they, still, mostly, delineate, the, same, regions, regardless, of, the, justification, the, wu, region, has, been, clearly, outlined, and, li, s, boundary, in, some, ways, has, remained, the, de, facto, standard, in, jerry, norman, s, usage, wu, dialects, can, be, considered, central, dialects, or, dialects, that, are, clearly, in, a, transition, zone, containing, features, that, typify, both, northern, and, southern, chinese, varieties, dialectologists, traditionally, establish, linguistic, boundaries, based, on, several, overlapping, isoglosses, of, linguistic, features, one, of, the, critical, historical, factors, for, these, boundaries, lies, in, the, movement, of, the, population, of, speakers, this, is, often, determined, by, the, administrative, boundaries, established, during, imperial, times, as, such, imperial, boundaries, are, essential, for, delineating, one, variety, from, another, and, many, varieties, isogloss, clusters, line, up, perfectly, with, the, county, boundaries, established, in, imperial, times, although, some, counties, contain, more, than, one, variety, and, others, may, span, several, counties, another, factor, that, influences, movement, and, transportation, as, well, as, the, establishment, of, administrative, boundaries, is, geography, northernmost, zhejiang, and, jiangsu, are, very, flat, being, in, the, middle, of, a, river, delta, and, as, such, are, more, uniform, than, the, more, mountainous, regions, farther, south, towards, fujian, the, taihu, varieties, like, mandarin, in, the, flat, northern, plains, are, more, homogeneous, than, southern, wu, which, has, a, significantly, greater, diversity, of, linguistic, forms, likely, a, direct, result, of, the, geography, coastal, varieties, also, share, more, featural, affinities, likely, because, the, east, china, sea, provides, a, means, of, transportation, the, same, phenomenon, can, be, seen, with, min, varieties, it, has, also, been, noted, that, huizhou, chinese, and, the, tongtai, branch, of, huai, chinese, share, significant, similarities, with, wu, chinese, wu, is, divided, into, two, major, groups, northern, wu, chinese, pinyin, b, ib, w, y, and, southern, wu, chinese, pinyin, n, nb, w, y, which, are, not, mutually, intelligible, individual, words, spoken, in, isolation, may, be, comprehensible, among, these, speakers, but, the, flowing, discourse, of, everyday, life, mostly, is, not, another, lesser, group, western, wu, is, synonymous, with, the, xuanzhou, division, which, not, only, has, a, larger, influence, from, the, surrounding, mandarin, varieties, than, much, of, northern, wu, but, also, has, very, unique, phonetic, innovations, making, it, typologically, quite, different, to, the, rest, of, wu, southern, wu, is, well, known, among, linguists, and, sinologists, as, being, one, of, the, most, internally, diverse, among, the, sinitic, groups, with, very, little, mutual, intelligibility, between, varieties, across, subgroups, in, the, first, edition, of, li, s, language, atlas, of, china, wu, was, divided, into, six, groups, cao, zhiyun, rearranged, some, of, the, southern, wu, divisions, based, on, a, larger, corpus, of, data, according, to, cao, it, can, be, divided, into, three, broad, divisions, taizhounese, remained, unchanged, as, it, was, not, included, in, the, study, this, was, later, adopted, by, the, second, edition, of, li, s, atlas, minor, adjustments, were, also, made, regarding, northern, wu, subdivisions, wu, varieties, typically, possess, a, larger, phonological, inventory, than, many, sinitic, languages, many, varieties, also, have, tone, systems, known, for, highly, complex, tone, sandhi, phonologies, of, wu, varieties, are, diverse, and, hard, to, generalize, as, such, only, typologically, significant, features, will, be, discussed, here, for, more, information, refer, to, individual, varieties, pages, in, terms, of, consonants, those, in, initial, positions, are, more, plentiful, than, those, in, finals, finals, typically, only, permit, two, consonant, phonemes, a, singular, nasal, and, a, glottal, stop, some, varieties, however, may, deviate, from, this, and, have, features, such, as, the, addition, of, k, or, the, omission, of, the, glottal, stop, wu, varieties, typically, preserve, qieyun, system, voiced, initials, b, d, z, v, etc, though, some, varieties, have, lost, this, feature, implosives, are, also, occasionally, found, in, wu, varieties, primarily, in, suburban, shanghainese, varieties, as, well, as, in, yongkangese, wu, languages, have, typologically, high, numbers, of, vowels, and, are, on, par, with, germanic, languages, in, having, the, largest, vowel, quality, inventories, in, the, world, the, jinhui, variety, spoken, in, shanghai, s, fengxian, district, can, be, analyzed, to, have, 20, vowel, qualities, the, abnormal, number, of, vowels, in, wu, is, due, in, part, to, rimes, ending, in, glottal, stops, may, be, analysed, as, a, short, vowel, in, many, varieties, as, well, as, unique, sound, shifts, such, as, the, tensing, of, qieyun, system, shan, and, xian, rimes, among, other, factors, both, breathy, and, creaky, voice, are, also, found, in, wu, varieties, breathy, voice, appears, in, northern, wu, and, may, act, as, a, depressor, that, lowers, the, pitch, of, the, entire, syllable, s, realization, creaky, voice, on, the, other, hand, is, found, in, taizhounese, and, is, associated, with, the, rising, tone, category, xuanzhou, wu, is, phonologically, very, unique, and, has, a, host, of, complex, syllables, such, as, wu, varieties, typically, have, 7, 8, tonemes, though, varieties, may, have, as, many, as, 12, tones, or, as, few, as, 5, many, merge, the, historical, light, rising, category, with, the, light, departing, the, reflexes, of, the, checked, tone, categories, may, be, complex, jinhuanese, irregularly, merge, it, with, other, tone, categories, while, wenzhounese, has, lengthened, tone, contours, rather, than, the, typological, norm, of, short, contourless, tones, tone, sandhi, in, sinitic, languages, can, occur, due, to, phonological, syntactic, or, morphological, reasons, though, most, varieties, only, employ, it, to, a, limited, extent, this, stands, in, stark, contrast, with, wu, in, which, all, three, can, trigger, tone, sandhi, examples, of, situations, that, can, trigger, unique, tone, sandhi, chains, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, relevant, changed, tone, is, highlighted, in, bold, tone, sandhi, in, sinitic, languages, can, typically, be, classified, as, left, or, right, dominant, systems, depending, on, whether, the, leftmost, or, rightmost, item, keeps, its, tone, both, systems, exist, in, wu, chinese, with, most, varieties, having, both, concurrently, right, dominant, is, more, associated, with, changes, in, part, of, speech, whereas, left, dominant, is, typically, seen, in, polysyllabic, terms, minimal, pairs, between, types, of, sandhi, also, exist, such, as, ts, 33, v, 213, to, fry, rice, and, ts, 334, v, 51, fried, rice, in, zhenhainese, or, t, i, 42, 33, nine, flasks, and, t, i, 42, 55, wine, flask, in, chongmingese, wu, languages, grammar, is, largely, similar, to, that, of, standard, chinese, though, they, do, diverge, in, quite, striking, ways, such, as, in, verb, object, complementizer, phrases, since, differences, exist, between, varieties, only, general, trends, will, be, included, below, much, like, other, chinese, languages, wu, languages, have, classifiers, primarily, mark, verbs, by, aspect, though, it, has, been, suggested, that, there, is, some, evidence, of, tenses, in, old, shanghainese, have, a, great, number, of, particles, including, sentence, final, particles, possess, svo, word, order, with, topic, fronting, topic, fronting, is, more, common, in, northern, wu, than, in, most, other, sinitic, languages, it,

that, in, 1926, hu, shih, stated, that, of, all, of, the, chinese, dialects, within, literature, wu, had, the, brightest, future, snow, concluded, that, instead, wu, dialect, writing, became, a, transient, phenomenon, that, died, out, not, long, after, its, growth, gathered, steam, snow, argued, that, the, primary, reason, was, the, increase, of, prestige, and, importance, in, baihua, and, that, one, other, contributing, reason, was, changing, market, factors, since, shanghai, s, publishing, industry, which, grew, served, all, of, china, and, not, just, shanghai, duval, argued, that,
