the, khoisan, languages, k, s, n, koy, sahn, also, khoesan, or, khoesaan, are, a, number, of, african, languages, once, classified, together, originally, by, joseph, greenberg, khoisan, is, defined, as, those, languages, that, have, click, consonants, and, do, not, belong, to, other, african, language, families, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, they, were, thought, to, be, genealogically, related, to, each, other, but, this, is, no, longer, accepted, they, are, now, held, to, comprise, three, distinct, language, families, and, two, language, isolates, all, but, two, khoisan, languages, are, indigenous, to, southern, africa, and, belong, to, three, language, families, the, khoe, family, appears, to, have, migrated, to, southern, africa, not, long, before, the, bantu, expansion, ethnically, their, speakers, are, the, khoikhoi, and, the, san, bushmen, two, languages, of, east, africa, those, of, the, sandawe, and, hadza, originally, were, also, classified, as, khoisan, although, their, speakers, are, ethnically, neither, khoikhoi, nor, san, before, the, bantu, expansion, khoisan, languages, or, languages, like, them, were, likely, spread, throughout, southern, and, eastern, africa, they, are, currently, restricted, to, the, kalahari, desert, primarily, in, namibia, and, botswana, and, to, the, rift, valley, in, central, tanzania, most, of, the, languages, are, endangered, and, several, are, moribund, or, extinct, most, have, no, written, record, the, only, widespread, khoisan, language, is, khoekhoe, also, known, as, khoekhoegowab, n, m, or, damara, of, namibia, botswana, and, south, africa, with, a, quarter, of, a, million, speakers, sandawe, in, tanzania, is, second, in, number, with, some, 40, 80, 000, some, monolingual, and, the, kung, language, of, the, northern, kalahari, spoken, by, some, 16, 000, or, so, people, language, use, is, quite, strong, among, the, 20, 000, speakers, of, naro, half, of, whom, speak, it, as, a, second, language, khoisan, languages, are, best, known, for, their, use, of, click, consonants, as, phonemes, these, are, typically, written, with, characters, such, as, and, clicks, are, quite, versatile, as, consonants, as, they, involve, two, articulations, of, the, tongue, which, can, operate, partially, independently, consequently, the, languages, with, the, greatest, numbers, of, consonants, in, the, world, are, khoisan, the, ju, hoan, language, has, 48, click, consonants, among, nearly, as, many, non, click, consonants, strident, and, pharyngealized, vowels, and, four, tones, the, x, and, h, languages, are, even, more, complex, khoisan, was, proposed, as, one, of, the, four, families, of, african, languages, in, joseph, greenberg, s, classification, 1949, 1954, revised, in, 1963, however, linguists, who, study, khoisan, languages, reject, their, unity, and, the, name, khoisan, is, used, by, them, as, a, term, of, convenience, without, any, implication, of, linguistic, validity, much, as, papuan, and, australian, are, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, similarities, of, the, tuu, and, kx, a, families, are, due, to, a, southern, african, sprachbund, rather, than, a, genealogical, relationship, whereas, the, khoe, or, perhaps, kwadi, khoe, family, is, a, more, recent, migrant, to, the, area, and, may, be, related, to, sandawe, in, east, africa, ernst, oswald, johannes, westphal, is, known, for, his, early, rejection, of, the, khoisan, language, family, starostin, 2003, bonny, sands, 1998, concluded, that, the, family, is, not, demonstrable, with, current, evidence, anthony, traill, at, first, accepted, khoisan, traill, 1986, but, by, 1998, concluded, that, it, could, not, be, demonstrated, with, current, data, and, methods, rejecting, it, as, based, on, a, single, typological, criterion, the, presence, of, clicks, dimmendaal, 2008, summarized, the, general, view, with, it, has, to, be, concluded, that, greenberg, s, intuitions, on, the, genetic, unity, of, khoisan, could, not, be, confirmed, by, subsequent, research, today, the, few, scholars, working, on, these, languages, treat, the, three, as, independent, language, families, that, cannot, or, can, no, longer, be, shown, to, be, genetically, related, p, 841, starostin, 2013, accepts, a, relationship, between, sandawe, and, khoi, is, plausible, as, is, one, between, tuu, and, kx, a, but, sees, no, indication, of, a, relationship, between, sandawe, and, khoi, on, the, one, hand, and, tuu, and, kx, a, on, the, other, or, between, any, of, them, and, hadza, janina, brutt, griffler, claims, given, that, such, colonial, borders, were, generally, arbitrarily, drawn, they, grouped, large, numbers, of, ethnic, groups, that, spoke, many, languages, she, hypothesizes, that, this, took, place, within, efforts, to, prevent, the, spread, of, english, during, european, colonization, and, prevent, the, entrance, of, the, majority, into, the, middle, class, anthony, traill, noted, the, khoisan, languages, extreme, variation, despite, their, shared, clicks, the, khoisan, languages, diverge, significantly, from, each, other, traill, demonstrated, this, linguistic, diversity, in, the, data, presented, in, the, below, table, the, first, two, columns, include, words, from, the, two, khoisan, language, isolates, sandawe, and, hadza, the, following, three, are, languages, from, the, khoe, family, the, kx, a, family, and, the, tuu, family, respectively, the, branches, that, were, once, considered, part, of, so, called, khoisan, are, now, considered, independent, families, since, it, has, not, been, demonstrated, that, they, are, related, according, to, the, standard, comparative, method, see, khoe, languages, for, speculations, on, the, linguistic, history, of, the, region, with, about, 800, speakers, in, tanzania, hadza, is, no, longer, seen, as, a, khoisan, language, and, appears, to, be, unrelated, to, any, other, language, genetically, the, hadza, people, are, unrelated, to, the, khoisan, peoples, of, southern, africa, and, their, closest, relatives, may, be, among, the, pygmies, of, central, africa, there, is, some, indication, that, sandawe, about, 40, 000, speakers, in, tanzania, may, be, related, to, the, khoe, family, such, as, a, congruent, pronominal, system, and, some, good, swadesh, list, matches, but, not, enough, to, establish, regular, sound, correspondences, sandawe, is, not, related, to, hadza, despite, their, proximity, the, khoe, family, is, both, the, most, numerous, and, diverse, family, of, khoisan, languages, with, seven, living, languages, and, over, a, quarter, million, speakers, although, little, kwadi, data, is, available, proto, khoe, kwadi, reconstructions, have, been, made, for, pronouns, and, some, basic, vocabulary, a, hai, om, language, is, listed, in, most, khoisan, references, a, century, ago, the, hai, om, people, spoke, a, ju, dialect, probably, close, to, kung, but, they, now, speak, a, divergent, dialect, of, nama, thus, their, language, is, variously, said, to, be, extinct, or, to, have, 18, 000, speakers, to, be, ju, or, to, be, khoe, their, numbers, have, been, included, under, nama, above, they, are, known, as, the, saa, by, the, nama, and, this, is, the, source, of, the, word, san, the, tuu, family, consists, of, two, language, clusters, which, are, related, to, each, other, at, about, the, distance, of, khoekhoe, and, tshukhwe, within, khoe, they, are, typologically, very, similar, to, the, kx, a, languages, below, but, have, not, been, demonstrated, to, be, related, to, them, genealogically, the, similarities, may, be, an, areal, feature, the, kx, a, family, is, a, relatively, distant, relationship, formally, demonstrated, in, 2010, starostin, 2013, gives, the, following, classification, of, the, khoisan, macrofamily, which, he, considers, to, be, a, single, coherent, language, family, however, this, classification, is, not, widely, accepted, not, all, languages, using, clicks, as, phonemes, are, considered, khoisan, most, others, are, neighboring, bantu, languages, in, southern, africa, the, nguni, languages, xhosa, zulu, swazi, phuthi, and, northern, ndebele, sotho, yeyi, in, botswana, and, mbukushu, kwangali, and, gciriku, in, the, caprivi, strip, clicks, are, spreading, to, a, few, additional, neighboring, languages, of, these, languages, xhosa, zulu, ndebele, and, yeyi, have, intricate, systems, of, click, consonants, the, others, despite, the, click, in, the, name, gciriku, more, rudimentary, ones, there, is, also, the, south, cushitic, language, dahalo, in, kenya, which, has, dental, clicks, in, a, few, score, words, and, an, extinct, and, presumably, artificial, australian, ritual, language, called, damin, which, had, only, nasal, clicks, the, bantu, languages, adopted, the, use, of, clicks, from, neighboring, displaced, or, absorbed, khoisan, populations, or, from, other, bantu, languages, often, through, intermarriage, while, the, dahalo, are, thought, to, have, retained, clicks, from, an, earlier, language, when, they, shifted, to, speaking, a, cushitic, language, if, so, the, pre, dahalo, language, may, have, been, something, like, hadza, or, sandawe, damin, is, an, invented, ritual, language, and, has, nothing, to, do, with, khoisan, these, are, the, only, languages, known, to, have, clicks, in, normal, vocabulary, occasionally, other, languages, are, said, by, laypeople, to, have, click, sounds, this, is, usually, a, misnomer, for, ejective, consonants, which, are, found, across, much, of, the, world, or, is, a, reference, to, paralinguistic, use, of, clicks, such, as, english, tsk, tsk, sample, basic, vocabulary, for, khoisan, language, families
