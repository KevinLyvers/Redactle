https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_dispute_resolution
alternative, dispute, resolution, adr, or, external, dispute, resolution, edr, typically, denotes, a, wide, range, of, dispute, resolution, processes, and, techniques, that, parties, can, use, to, settle, disputes, with, the, help, of, a, third, party, they, are, used, for, disagreeing, parties, who, cannot, come, to, an, agreement, short, of, litigation, however, adr, is, also, increasingly, being, adopted, as, a, tool, to, help, settle, disputes, within, the, court, system, despite, historic, resistance, to, adr, by, many, popular, parties, and, their, advocates, adr, has, gained, widespread, acceptance, among, both, the, general, public, and, the, legal, profession, in, recent, years, in, 2008, some, courts, required, some, parties, to, resort, to, adr, of, some, type, like, mediation, before, permitting, the, parties, cases, to, be, tried, the, european, mediation, directive, 2008, expressly, contemplates, so, called, compulsory, mediation, this, means, that, attendance, is, compulsory, not, that, settlement, must, be, reached, through, mediation, additionally, parties, to, merger, and, acquisition, transactions, are, increasingly, turning, to, adr, to, resolve, post, acquisition, disputes, in, england, and, wales, adr, is, now, more, commonly, referred, to, as, ncdr, non, court, dispute, resolution, in, an, effort, to, promote, this, as, the, normal, rather, than, alternative, way, to, resolve, disputes, a, 2023, judgment, of, the, court, of, appeal, called, churchill, v, merthyr, confirmed, that, in, the, right, case, the, court, can, order, i, the, parties, to, engage, in, ncdr, and, or, ii, stay, the, proceedings, to, allow, for, ncdr, to, take, place, this, overturns, the, previous, orthodoxy, the, 2004, court, of, appeal, decision, of, halsey, v, milton, keynes, general, nhs, trust, which, was, that, unwilling, parties, could, not, be, obliged, to, participate, in, ncdr, the, rising, popularity, of, adr, can, be, explained, by, the, increasing, caseload, of, traditional, courts, the, perception, that, adr, imposes, fewer, costs, than, litigation, a, preference, for, confidentiality, and, the, desire, of, some, parties, to, have, greater, control, over, the, selection, of, the, individual, or, individuals, who, will, decide, their, dispute, some, of, the, senior, judiciary, in, certain, jurisdictions, of, which, england, and, wales, is, one, are, strongly, in, favour, of, this, use, of, mediation, and, other, ncdr, processes, to, settle, disputes, since, the, 1990s, many, american, courts, have, also, increasingly, advocated, for, the, use, of, adr, to, settle, disputes, however, it, is, not, clear, as, to, whether, litigants, can, properly, identify, and, then, use, the, adr, programmes, available, to, them, thereby, potentially, limiting, their, effectiveness, the, term, alternative, dispute, resolution, arose, from, frank, sander, s, paper, varieties, of, dispute, processing, traditional, arbitration, involved, heads, of, trade, guilds, or, other, dominant, authorities, settling, disputes, the, modern, innovation, was, to, have, commercial, vendors, of, arbitrators, often, ones, with, little, or, no, social, or, political, dominance, over, the, parties, the, advantage, was, that, such, persons, are, much, more, readily, available, the, disadvantage, is, that, it, does, not, involve, the, community, of, the, parties, when, wool, contract, arbitration, was, conducted, by, senior, guild, officials, the, arbitrator, combined, a, seasoned, expert, on, the, subject, matter, with, a, socially, dominant, individual, whose, patronage, goodwill, and, opinion, were, important, adr, can, increasingly, be, conducted, online, which, is, known, as, online, dispute, resolution, odr, which, is, mostly, a, buzzword, and, an, attempt, to, create, a, distinctive, product, odr, services, can, be, provided, by, government, entities, and, as, such, may, form, part, of, the, litigation, process, moreover, they, can, be, provided, on, a, global, scale, where, no, effective, domestic, remedies, are, available, to, disputing, parties, as, in, the, case, of, the, udrp, and, domain, name, disputes, in, this, respect, odr, might, not, satisfy, the, alternative, element, of, adr, in, england, and, wales, the, online, procedure, rule, committee, was, set, up, under, the, judicial, review, and, courts, act, 2022, to, make, rules, governing, the, practice, and, procedure, for, specific, types, of, online, court, and, tribunal, proceedings, across, the, civil, family, and, tribunal, jurisdictions, oprc, is, an, advisory, non, departmental, public, body, sponsored, by, the, ministry, of, justice, the, committee, is, chaired, by, the, master, of, the, rolls, head, of, civil, justice, adr, has, historically, been, divided, between, methods, of, resolving, disputes, outside, of, official, judicial, mechanisms, and, informal, methods, attached, to, official, judicial, mechanisms, regardless, of, whether, they, are, part, of, an, overarching, proceeding, the, mechanisms, are, generally, similar, there, are, four, general, classes, of, adr, negotiation, mediation, collaborative, law, and, arbitration, in, some, contexts, such, as, in, the, settlement, of, investment, disputes, arbitration, is, not, considered, as, a, form, of, adr, since, it, is, the, principal, means, of, settling, these, disputes, some, academics, include, conciliation, as, a, fifth, category, but, others, include, this, within, the, definition, of, mediation, conflict, resolution, is, one, major, goal, of, all, the, adr, processes, if, a, process, leads, to, resolution, it, is, a, dispute, resolution, process, alternative, dispute, resolution, is, usually, considered, to, be, alternative, to, litigation, for, example, corporate, dispute, resolution, can, involve, a, customer, service, department, handling, disputes, about, its, own, products, addressing, concerns, between, consumers, and, independent, third, party, sellers, and, participating, in, a, reputation, based, enforcement, mechanism, it, also, can, be, used, as, a, colloquialism, for, allowing, a, dispute, to, drop, or, as, an, alternative, to, violence, in, recent, years, there, has, been, more, discussion, about, taking, a, systems, approach, in, order, to, offer, different, kinds, of, options, to, people, who, are, in, conflict, and, to, foster, appropriate, dispute, resolution, that, is, some, cases, and, some, complaints, in, fact, ought, to, go, to, a, formal, grievance, to, a, court, to, the, police, to, a, compliance, officer, or, to, a, government, ig, other, conflicts, could, be, settled, by, the, parties, if, they, had, enough, support, and, coaching, and, yet, other, cases, need, mediation, or, arbitration, thus, alternative, dispute, resolution, usually, means, a, method, that, is, not, the, courts, appropriate, dispute, resolution, considers, all, the, possible, responsible, options, for, conflict, resolution, that, are, relevant, for, a, given, issue, in, negotiation, participation, is, voluntary, and, there, is, no, third, party, who, facilitates, the, resolution, process, or, imposes, a, resolution, nb, a, third, party, like, a, chaplain, or, organizational, ombudsperson, or, social, worker, or, a, skilled, friend, may, be, coaching, one, or, both, of, the, parties, behind, the, scene, a, process, called, helping, people, help, themselves, see, helping, people, help, themselves, in, negotiation, journal, july, 1990, pp, 239, 248, which, includes, a, section, on, helping, someone, draft, a, letter, to, someone, who, is, perceived, to, have, wronged, them, in, mediation, there, is, a, third, party, a, mediator, who, facilitates, the, resolution, process, and, may, even, suggest, a, resolution, typically, known, as, a, mediator, s, proposal, but, does, not, impose, a, resolution, on, the, parties, in, some, countries, for, example, the, united, kingdom, adr, is, synonymous, with, what, is, generally, referred, to, as, mediation, in, other, countries, structured, transformative, mediation, as, used, by, the, u, s, postal, service, is, a, formal, process, traditional, people, s, mediation, has, always, involved, the, parties, remaining, in, contact, for, most, or, all, of, the, mediation, session, the, innovation, of, separating, the, parties, after, or, sometimes, before, a, joint, session, and, conducting, the, rest, of, the, process, without, the, parties, in, the, same, area, was, a, major, innovation, and, one, that, dramatically, improved, mediation, s, success, rate, lawyer, supported, mediation, is, a, non, adversarial, method, of, alternative, dispute, resolution, to, resolves, disputes, such, as, to, settle, family, issues, at, a, time, of, divorce, or, separation, including, child, support, custody, issues, and, division, of, property, party, directed, mediation, pdm, is, an, approach, to, mediation, that, seeks, to, empower, each, party, in, a, dispute, enabling, each, party, to, have, more, direct, influence, upon, the, resolution, of, a, conflict, by, offering, both, means, and, processes, for, enhancing, the, negotiation, skills, of, contenders, the, intended, prospect, of, party, directed, mediation, is, to, improve, upon, the, ability, and, willingness, of, disputants, to, deal, with, subsequent, differences, in, collaborative, law, or, collaborative, divorce, each, party, has, an, attorney, who, facilitates, the, resolution, process, within, specifically, contracted, terms, the, parties, reach, an, agreement, with, the, support, of, the, attorneys, who, are, trained, in, the, process, and, mutually, agreed, experts, no, one, imposes, a, resolution, on, the, parties, in, arbitration, participation, is, typically, voluntary, and, there, is, a, third, party, who, as, a, private, judge, imposes, a, resolution, arbitrations, often, occur, because, parties, to, contracts, agree, that, any, future, dispute, concerning, the, agreement, will, be, resolved, by, arbitration, this, is, known, as, a, scott, avery, clause, in, recent, years, the, enforceability, of, arbitration, clauses, particularly, in, the, context, of, consumer, agreements, e, g, credit, card, agreements, has, drawn, scrutiny, from, courts, although, parties, may, appeal, arbitration, outcomes, to, courts, such, appeals, face, an, exacting, standard, of, review, conciliation, is, an, alternative, dispute, resolution, adr, process, whereby, the, parties, to, a, dispute, use, a, conciliator, who, meets, with, the, parties, both, separately, and, together, in, an, attempt, to, resolve, their, differences, they, do, this, by, lowering, tensions, improving, communications, interpreting, issues, encouraging, parties, to, explore, potential, solutions, and, assisting, parties, in, finding, a, mutually, acceptable, outcome, beyond, the, basic, types, of, alternative, dispute, resolutions, there, are, other, different, forms, of, adr, case, evaluation, is, a, non, binding, process, in, which, parties, present, the, facts, and, the, issues, to, a, neutral, case, evaluator, who, advises, the, parties, on, the, strengths, and, weaknesses, of, their, respective, positions, and, assesses, how, the, dispute, is, likely, to, be, decided, by, a, jury, or, other, adjudicator, early, neutral, evaluation, is, a, process, that, takes, place, soon, after, a, case, has, been, filed, in, court, the, case, is, referred, to, an, expert, who, is, asked, to, provide, a, balanced, and, neutral, evaluation, of, the, dispute, the, evaluation, of, the, expert, can, assist, the, parties, in, assessing, their, case, and, may, influence, them, towards, a, settlement, one, couple, one, lawyer, or, single, lawyer, is, a, family, law, process, developed, in, england, and, wales, where, a, separating, couple, shares, one, lawyer, who, advises, them, both, impartially, and, together, as, to, how, a, judge, would, view, their, case, and, the, likely, outcome, were, they, to, litigate, thus, enabling, them, to, reach, a, fair, settlement, on, separation, or, divorce, this, differs, from, early, neutral, evaluation, as, it, is, designed, so, that, parties, never, require, separate, representation, are, assisted, throughout, by, one, legal, team, and, the, process, has, no, adversarial, features, at, all, either, at, the, financial, disclosure, or, advice, stages, in, april, 2024, a, new, definition, of, ncdr, was, set, out, in, the, family, procedure, amendments, no, 2, rules, 2023, 1324, as, methods, of, resolving, a, dispute, other, than, through, the, court, process, including, but, not, limited, to, mediation, arbitration, evaluation, by, a, neutral, third, party, such, as, a, private, financial, dispute, resolution, process, and, collaborative, law, in, the, accompanying, pre, application, protocol, annex, to, pd9a, the, one, couple, one, lawyer, process, was, also, referenced, the, court, may, also, consider, the, parties, having, obtained, legal, advice, via, the, single, lawyer, or, a, one, couple, one, lawyer, scheme, as, good, evidence, of, a, constructive, attempt, to, obtain, advice, and, avoid, unnecessary, proceedings, family, group, conference, is, a, meeting, between, members, of, a, family, and, members, of, their, extended, related, group, at, this, meeting, or, often, a, series, of, meetings, the, family, becomes, involved, in, learning, skills, for, interaction, and, in, making, a, plan, to, stop, the, abuse, or, other, ill, treatment, between, its, members, neutral, fact, finding, is, a, process, where, a, neutral, third, party, selected, either, by, the, disputing, parties, or, by, the, court, investigates, an, issue, and, reports, or, testifies, in, court, the, neutral, fact, finding, process, is, particularly, useful, for, resolving, complex, scientific, and, factual, disputes, expert, determination, is, a, procedure, where, a, dispute, or, a, difference, between, the, parties, is, submitted, by, mutual, agreement, of, the, parties, to, one, or, more, experts, who, make, a, determination, on, the, matter, referred, to, them, the, determination, is, binding, unless, the, parties, agreed, otherwise, and, is, a, confidential, procedure, ombudsmen, are, a, third, party, selected, by, an, institution, for, example, a, university, hospital, corporation, or, government, agency, to, deal, with, complaints, by, employees, clients, or, constituents, an, organizational, ombudsman, works, within, the, institution, to, look, into, complaints, independently, and, impartially, calling, an, organizational, ombudsman, is, always, voluntary, according, to, the, international, ombudsman, association, standards, of, practice, no, one, can, be, compelled, to, use, an, ombudsman, office, organizational, ombudsman, offices, refer, people, to, all, conflict, management, options, in, the, organization, formal, and, informal, rights, based, and, interest, based, but, in, addition, in, part, because, they, have, no, decision, making, authority, ombudsman, offices, can, themselves, offer, a, wide, spectrum, of, informal, options, however, adr, is, less, suitable, than, litigation, when, there, is, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, canada, saw, the, beginning, of, a, cultural, shift, in, their, experience, with, adr, practices, during, this, time, the, need, was, recognized, for, an, alternative, to, the, more, adversarial, approach, to, dispute, settlement, that, is, typical, in, traditional, court, proceedings, this, growth, continued, over, the, coming, decades, with, adr, now, being, widely, recognized, as, a, legitimate, and, effective, approach, to, dispute, resolution, in, 2014, the, supreme, court, of, canada, stated, in, hryniak, v, mauldin, that, meaningful, access, to, justice, is, now, the, greatest, challenge, to, the, rule, of, law, in, canada, today, balance, between, procedure, and, access, struck, by, our, justice, system, must, reflect, modern, reality, and, recognize, that, new, models, of, adjudication, can, be, fair, and, just, however, in, the, decades, leading, up, to, this, declaration, there, had, already, been, a, number, of, experiments, in, adr, practices, across, the, provinces, one, of, the, first, and, most, notable, adr, initiatives, in, canada, began, on, 4, january, 1999, with, the, creation, of, the, ontario, mandatory, mediation, program, this, program, included, the, implementation, of, rule, 24, 1, which, established, mandatory, mediation, for, non, family, civil, case, managed, actions, beginning, in, a, selection, of, courts, across, ontario, and, ottawa, in, 1999, the, program, would, be, expanded, in, 2002, to, cover, windsor, ontario, s, third, largest, judicial, area, until, this, point, opposition, to, mandatory, mediation, in, place, of, traditional, litigation, had, been, grounded, in, the, idea, that, mediation, practices, are, effective, when, disputing, parties, voluntarily, embrace, the, process, however, reports, analyzing, the, effectiveness, of, ontario, s, experiment, concluded, that, overall, mandatory, mediation, as, a, form, of, adr, was, able, to, reduce, both, the, cost, and, time, delay, of, finding, a, dispute, resolution, compared, to, a, control, group, in, addition, to, this, 2, 3, s, of, the, parties, surveyed, from, this, study, outlined, the, benefits, to, mandatory, mediation, these, included, i, providing, one, or, more, parties, with, new, information, they, considered, relevant, ii, identifying, matters, important, to, one, or, more, of, the, parties, iii, setting, priorities, among, issues, iv, facilitating, discussion, of, new, settlement, offers, v, achieving, better, awareness, of, the, potential, monetary, savings, from, settling, earlier, in, the, litigation, process, vi, at, least, one, of, the, parties, gaining, a, better, understanding, of, his, or, her, own, adr, in, administrative, litigation, 157, case, and, vii, at, least, one, of, the, parties, gaining, a, better, understanding, of, his, or, her, opponent, s, case, in, other, provinces, the, need, for, adr, to, at, least, be, examined, as, an, alternative, to, traditional, court, proceedings, has, also, been, expressed, for, instance, in, 2015, quebec, implemented, the, new, code, which, mandated, that, parties, must, at, least, consider, mediation, before, moving, to, settle, a, dispute, in, court, the, new, code, also, codified, the, role, of, the, mediator, in, the, courtroom, outlining, that, mediators, must, remain, impartial, and, cannot, give, evidence, on, either, party, s, behalf, should, the, dispute, progress, to, a, judicial, proceeding, in, 2009, a, report, showed, that, manitoba, s, experience, with, their, judicially, assisted, dispute, resolution, program, an, adr, initiative, where, the, court, appoints, a, judge, to, act, as, a, mediator, between, two, disputing, parties, who, both, voluntarily, wish, to, pursue, jadr, one, of, the, main, arguments, for, adr, practices, in, canada, cites, the, over, clogged, judicial, system, this, is, one, of, the, main, arguments, for, adr, across, many, regions, however, alberta, in, particular, suffers, from, this, issue, with, a, rising, population, in, 2018, alberta, had, the, highest, ratio, for, the, population, to, superior, court, justices, 63, 000, 1, the, national, average, on, the, other, hand, is, nearly, half, that, with, one, justice, being, counted, for, every, 35, 000, canadians, to, become, qualified, as, a, mediator, in, canada, it, is, possible, to, gain, mediation, training, through, certain, private, organizations, or, post, secondary, institutions, the, adr, institute, of, canada, adric, is, the, preeminent, adr, training, organization, in, canada, alternative, dispute, resolution, in, india, is, not, new, and, it, was, in, existence, even, under, the, previous, arbitration, act, of, 1940, the, arbitration, and, conciliation, act, 1996, has, been, enacted, to, accommodate, the, harmonization, mandates, of, uncitral, model, to, streamline, the, indian, legal, system, the, traditional, civil, law, known, as, code, of, civil, procedure, cpc, 1908, has, also, been, amended, and, section, 89, has, been, introduced, section, 89, 1, of, cpc, provides, an, option, for, the, settlement, of, disputes, outside, the, court, it, provides, that, where, it, appears, to, the, court, that, there, exist, elements, that, may, be, acceptable, to, the, parties, the, court, may, formulate, the, terms, of, a, possible, settlement, and, refer, the, same, for, arbitration, conciliation, mediation, or, judicial, settlement, due, to, the, extremely, slow, judicial, process, there, has, been, a, large, emphasis, on, alternate, dispute, resolution, mechanisms, in, india, while, the, arbitration, and, conciliation, act, of, 1996, is, a, fairly, standard, western, approach, towards, adr, the, lok, adalat, system, constituted, under, the, national, legal, services, authority, act, 1987, is, a, uniquely, indian, approach, a, study, on, commercial, dispute, resolution, in, south, india, has, been, done, by, a, think, tank, organization, based, in, kochi, centre, for, public, policy, research, the, study, reveals, that, the, court, annexed, mediation, centre, in, bangalore, has, a, success, rate, of, 64, while, its, counterpart, in, kerala, has, an, average, success, rate, of, 27, 7, furthermore, amongst, the, three, southern, states, karnataka, tamil, nadu, and, kerala, tamil, nadu, is, said, to, have, the, highest, adoption, of, dispute, resolution, kerala, the, least, an, act, to, consolidate, and, amend, the, law, relating, to, domestic, arbitration, international, commercial, arbitration, and, enforcement, of, foreign, arbitral, awards, as, also, to, define, the, law, relating, to, conciliation, and, for, matters, connected, therewith, or, incidental, thereto, the, process, of, arbitration, can, start, only, if, there, exists, a, valid, arbitration, agreement, between, the, parties, prior, to, the, emergence, of, the, dispute, as, per, section, 7, such, an, agreement, must, be, in, writing, the, contract, regarding, which, the, dispute, exists, must, either, contain, an, arbitration, clause, or, must, refer, to, a, separate, document, signed, by, the, parties, containing, the, arbitration, agreement, the, existence, of, an, arbitration, agreement, can, also, be, inferred, by, written, correspondence, such, as, letters, telex, or, telegrams, which, provide, a, record, of, an, agreement, an, exchange, of, statement, of, claim, and, defence, in, which, the, existence, of, an, arbitration, agreement, is, alleged, by, one, party, and, not, denied, by, other, is, also, considered, as, a, valid, written, arbitration, agreement, any, party, to, the, dispute, can, start, the, process, of, appointing, an, arbitrator, and, if, the, other, party, does, not, cooperate, the, party, can, approach, the, office, of, chief, justice, for, the, appointment, of, an, arbitrator, there, are, only, two, grounds, upon, which, a, party, can, challenge, the, appointment, of, an, arbitrator, reasonable, doubt, in, the, impartiality, of, the, arbitrator, and, the, lack, of, proper, qualification, of, the, arbitrator, as, required, by, the, arbitration, agreement, a, sole, arbitrator, or, a, panel, of, arbitrators, so, appointed, constitute, the, arbitration, tribunal, except, for, some, interim, measures, there, is, very, little, scope, for, judicial, intervention, in, the, arbitration, process, the, arbitration, tribunal, has, jurisdiction, over, its, own, jurisdiction, thus, if, a, party, wants, to, challenge, the, jurisdiction, of, the, arbitration, tribunal, it, can, do, so, only, before, the, tribunal, itself, if, the, tribunal, rejects, the, request, there, is, little, the, party, can, do, except, to, approach, a, court, after, the, tribunal, makes, an, award, section, 34, provides, certain, grounds, upon, which, a, party, can, appeal, to, the, principal, civil, court, of, original, jurisdiction, for, setting, aside, the, award, the, period, for, filing, an, appeal, for, setting, aside, an, award, is, over, or, if, such, an, appeal, is, rejected, the, award, is, binding, on, the, parties, and, is, considered, as, a, decree, of, the, court, conciliation, is, a, less, formal, form, of, arbitration, this, process, does, not, require, the, existence, of, any, prior, agreement, any, party, can, request, the, other, party, to, appoint, a, conciliator, one, conciliator, is, preferred, but, two, or, three, are, also, allowed, in, the, case, of, multiple, conciliators, all, must, act, jointly, if, a, party, rejects, an, offer, to, conciliate, there, can, be, no, conciliation, parties, may, submit, statements, to, the, conciliator, describing, the, general, nature, of, the, dispute, and, the, points, at, issue, each, party, sends, a, copy, of, the, statement, to, the, other, the, conciliator, may, request, further, details, may, ask, to, meet, the, parties, or, communicate, with, the, parties, orally, or, in, writing, parties, may, even, submit, suggestions, for, the, settlement, of, the, dispute, to, the, conciliator, when, it, appears, to, the, conciliator, that, elements, of, settlement, exist, he, may, draw, up, the, terms, of, the, settlement, and, send, it, to, the, parties, for, their, acceptance, if, both, the, parties, sign, the, settlement, document, it, shall, be, final, and, binding, on, both, this, process, is, similar, to, the, us, practice, of, mediation, however, in, india, mediation, is, different, from, conciliation, and, is, a, completely, informal, type, of, adr, mechanism, etymologically, lok, adalat, means, people, s, court, india, has, had, a, long, history, of, resolving, disputes, through, the, mediation, of, village, elders, the, current, system, of, lok, adalats, is, an, improvement, on, that, and, is, based, on, gandhian, principles, this, is, a, non, adversarial, system, whereby, mock, courts, called, lok, adalats, are, held, by, the, state, authority, district, authority, supreme, court, legal, services, committee, high, court, legal, services, committee, or, taluk, legal, services, committee, periodically, for, exercising, such, jurisdiction, as, they, think, fit, these, are, usually, presided, by, a, retired, judge, social, activists, or, members, of, the, legal, profession, it, does, not, have, jurisdiction, on, matters, related, to, non, compoundable, offences, while, in, regular, suits, the, plaintiff, is, required, to, pay, the, prescribed, court, fee, in, lok, adalat, there, is, no, court, fee, and, no, rigid, procedural, requirement, i, e, no, need, to, follow, the, process, given, by, civil, procedure, code,
