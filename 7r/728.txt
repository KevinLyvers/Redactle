emotions, are, physical, and, mental, states, brought, on, by, neurophysiological, changes, variously, associated, with, thoughts, feelings, behavioral, responses, and, a, degree, of, pleasure, or, displeasure, there, is, no, scientific, consensus, on, a, definition, emotions, are, often, intertwined, with, mood, temperament, personality, disposition, or, creativity, research, on, emotion, has, increased, over, the, past, two, decades, with, many, fields, contributing, including, psychology, medicine, history, sociology, of, emotions, computer, science, and, philosophy, the, numerous, attempts, to, explain, the, origin, function, and, other, aspects, of, emotions, have, fostered, intense, research, on, this, topic, theorizing, about, the, evolutionary, origin, and, possible, purpose, of, emotion, dates, back, to, charles, darwin, current, areas, of, research, include, the, neuroscience, of, emotion, using, tools, like, pet, and, fmri, scans, to, study, the, affective, picture, processes, in, the, brain, from, a, mechanistic, perspective, emotions, can, be, defined, as, a, positive, or, negative, experience, that, is, associated, with, a, particular, pattern, of, physiological, activity, emotions, are, complex, involving, multiple, different, components, such, as, subjective, experience, cognitive, processes, expressive, behavior, psychophysiological, changes, and, instrumental, behavior, at, one, time, academics, attempted, to, identify, the, emotion, with, one, of, the, components, william, james, with, a, subjective, experience, behaviorists, with, instrumental, behavior, psychophysiologists, with, physiological, changes, and, so, on, more, recently, emotion, has, been, said, to, consist, of, all, the, components, the, different, components, of, emotion, are, categorized, somewhat, differently, depending, on, the, academic, discipline, in, psychology, and, philosophy, emotion, typically, includes, a, subjective, conscious, experience, characterized, primarily, by, psychophysiological, expressions, biological, reactions, and, mental, states, a, similar, multi, componential, description, of, emotion, is, found, in, sociology, for, example, peggy, thoits, described, emotions, as, involving, physiological, components, cultural, or, emotional, labels, anger, surprise, etc, expressive, body, actions, and, the, appraisal, of, situations, and, contexts, cognitive, processes, like, reasoning, and, decision, making, are, often, regarded, as, separate, from, emotional, processes, making, a, division, between, thinking, and, feeling, however, not, all, theories, of, emotion, regard, this, separation, as, valid, nowadays, most, research, into, emotions, in, the, clinical, and, well, being, context, focuses, on, emotion, dynamics, in, daily, life, predominantly, the, intensity, of, specific, emotions, and, their, variability, instability, inertia, and, differentiation, as, well, as, whether, and, how, emotions, augment, or, blunt, each, other, over, time, and, differences, in, these, dynamics, between, people, and, along, the, lifespan, the, word, emotion, dates, back, to, 1579, when, it, was, adapted, from, the, french, word, mouvoir, which, means, to, stir, up, the, term, emotion, was, introduced, into, academic, discussion, as, a, catch, all, term, to, passions, sentiments, and, affections, the, word, emotion, was, coined, in, the, early, 1800s, by, thomas, brown, and, it, is, around, the, 1830s, that, the, modern, concept, of, emotion, first, emerged, for, the, english, language, no, one, felt, emotions, before, about, 1830, instead, they, felt, other, things, passions, accidents, of, the, soul, moral, sentiments, and, explained, them, very, differently, from, how, we, understand, emotions, today, some, cross, cultural, studies, indicate, that, the, categorization, of, emotion, and, classification, of, basic, emotions, such, as, anger, and, sadness, are, not, universal, and, that, the, boundaries, and, domains, of, these, concepts, are, categorized, differently, by, all, cultures, however, others, argue, that, there, are, some, universal, bases, of, emotions, see, section, 6, 1, in, psychiatry, and, psychology, an, inability, to, express, or, perceive, emotion, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, alexithymia, human, nature, and, the, accompanying, bodily, sensations, have, always, been, part, of, the, interests, of, thinkers, and, philosophers, far, more, extensively, this, has, also, been, of, great, interest, to, both, western, and, eastern, societies, emotional, states, have, been, associated, with, the, divine, and, with, the, enlightenment, of, the, human, mind, and, body, the, ever, changing, actions, of, individuals, and, their, mood, variations, have, been, of, great, importance, to, most, of, the, western, philosophers, including, aristotle, plato, descartes, aquinas, and, hobbes, leading, them, to, propose, extensive, theories, often, competing, theories, that, sought, to, explain, emotion, and, the, accompanying, motivators, of, human, action, as, well, as, its, consequences, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, scottish, thinker, david, hume, proposed, a, revolutionary, argument, that, sought, to, explain, the, main, motivators, of, human, action, and, conduct, he, proposed, that, actions, are, motivated, by, fears, desires, and, passions, as, he, wrote, in, his, book, a, treatise, of, human, nature, 1773, reason, alone, can, never, be, a, motive, to, any, action, of, the, will, it, can, never, oppose, passion, in, the, direction, of, the, will, the, reason, is, and, ought, to, be, the, slave, of, the, passions, and, can, never, pretend, to, any, other, office, than, to, serve, and, obey, them, with, these, lines, hume, attempted, to, explain, that, reason, and, further, action, would, be, subject, to, the, desires, and, experience, of, the, self, later, thinkers, would, propose, that, actions, and, emotions, are, deeply, interrelated, with, social, political, historical, and, cultural, aspects, of, reality, that, would, also, come, to, be, associated, with, sophisticated, neurological, and, physiological, research, on, the, brain, and, other, parts, of, the, physical, body, the, lexico, definition, of, emotion, is, a, strong, feeling, deriving, from, one, s, circumstances, mood, or, relationships, with, others, emotions, are, responses, to, significant, internal, and, external, events, emotions, can, be, occurrences, e, g, panic, or, dispositions, e, g, hostility, and, short, lived, e, g, anger, or, long, lived, e, g, grief, psychotherapist, michael, c, graham, describes, all, emotions, as, existing, on, a, continuum, of, intensity, thus, fear, might, range, from, mild, concern, to, terror, or, shame, might, range, from, simple, embarrassment, to, toxic, shame, emotions, have, been, described, as, consisting, of, a, coordinated, set, of, responses, which, may, include, verbal, physiological, behavioral, and, neural, mechanisms, emotions, have, been, categorized, with, some, relationships, existing, between, emotions, and, some, direct, opposites, existing, graham, differentiates, emotions, as, functional, or, dysfunctional, and, argues, all, functional, emotions, have, benefits, in, some, uses, of, the, word, emotions, are, intense, feelings, that, are, directed, at, someone, or, something, on, the, other, hand, emotion, can, be, used, to, refer, to, states, that, are, mild, as, in, annoyed, or, content, and, to, states, that, are, not, directed, at, anything, as, in, anxiety, and, depression, one, line, of, research, looks, at, the, meaning, of, the, word, emotion, in, everyday, language, and, finds, that, this, usage, is, rather, different, from, that, in, academic, discourse, in, practical, terms, joseph, ledoux, has, defined, emotions, as, the, result, of, a, cognitive, and, conscious, process, which, occurs, in, response, to, a, body, system, response, to, a, trigger, according, to, scherer, s, component, process, model, cpm, of, emotion, there, are, five, crucial, elements, of, emotion, from, the, component, process, perspective, emotional, experience, requires, that, all, of, these, processes, become, coordinated, and, synchronized, for, a, short, period, of, time, driven, by, appraisal, processes, although, the, inclusion, of, cognitive, appraisal, as, one, of, the, elements, is, slightly, controversial, since, some, theorists, make, the, assumption, that, emotion, and, cognition, are, separate, but, interacting, systems, the, cpm, provides, a, sequence, of, events, that, effectively, describes, the, coordination, involved, during, an, emotional, episode, emotion, can, be, differentiated, from, a, number, of, similar, constructs, within, the, field, of, affective, neuroscience, there, is, no, single, universally, accepted, evolutionary, theory, the, most, prominent, ideas, suggest, that, emotions, have, evolved, to, serve, various, adaptive, functions, a, distinction, can, be, made, between, emotional, episodes, and, emotional, dispositions, emotional, dispositions, are, also, comparable, to, character, traits, where, someone, may, be, said, to, be, generally, disposed, to, experience, certain, emotions, for, example, an, irritable, person, is, generally, disposed, to, feel, irritation, more, easily, or, quickly, than, others, do, finally, some, theorists, place, emotions, within, a, more, general, category, of, affective, states, where, affective, states, can, also, include, emotion, related, phenomena, such, as, pleasure, and, pain, motivational, states, for, example, hunger, or, curiosity, moods, dispositions, and, traits, for, more, than, 40, years, paul, ekman, has, supported, the, view, that, emotions, are, discrete, measurable, and, physiologically, distinct, ekman, s, most, influential, work, revolved, around, the, finding, that, certain, emotions, appeared, to, be, universally, recognized, even, in, cultures, that, were, preliterate, and, could, not, have, learned, associations, for, facial, expressions, through, media, another, classic, study, found, that, when, participants, contorted, their, facial, muscles, into, distinct, facial, expressions, for, example, disgust, they, reported, subjective, and, physiological, experiences, that, matched, the, distinct, facial, expressions, ekman, s, facial, expression, research, examined, six, basic, emotions, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and, surprise, later, in, his, career, ekman, theorized, that, other, universal, emotions, may, exist, beyond, these, six, in, light, of, this, recent, cross, cultural, studies, led, by, daniel, cordaro, and, dacher, keltner, both, former, students, of, ekman, extended, the, list, of, universal, emotions, in, addition, to, the, original, six, these, studies, provided, evidence, for, amusement, awe, contentment, desire, embarrassment, pain, relief, and, sympathy, in, both, facial, and, vocal, expressions, they, also, found, evidence, for, boredom, confusion, interest, pride, and, shame, facial, expressions, as, well, as, contempt, relief, and, triumph, vocal, expressions, robert, plutchik, agreed, with, ekman, s, biologically, driven, perspective, but, developed, the, wheel, of, emotions, suggesting, eight, primary, emotions, grouped, on, a, positive, or, negative, basis, joy, versus, sadness, anger, versus, fear, trust, versus, disgust, and, surprise, versus, anticipation, some, basic, emotions, can, be, modified, to, form, complex, emotions, the, complex, emotions, could, arise, from, cultural, conditioning, or, association, combined, with, the, basic, emotions, alternatively, similar, to, the, way, primary, colors, combine, primary, emotions, could, blend, to, form, the, full, spectrum, of, human, emotional, experience, for, example, interpersonal, anger, and, disgust, could, blend, to, form, contempt, relationships, exist, between, basic, emotions, resulting, in, positive, or, negative, influences, jaak, panksepp, carved, out, seven, biologically, inherited, primary, affective, systems, called, seeking, expectancy, fear, anxiety, rage, anger, lust, sexual, excitement, care, nurturance, panic, grief, sadness, and, play, social, joy, he, proposed, what, is, known, as, core, self, to, be, generating, these, affects, psychologists, have, used, methods, such, as, factor, analysis, to, attempt, to, map, emotion, related, responses, onto, a, more, limited, number, of, dimensions, such, methods, attempt, to, boil, emotions, down, to, underlying, dimensions, that, capture, the, similarities, and, differences, between, experiences, often, the, first, two, dimensions, uncovered, by, factor, analysis, are, valence, how, negative, or, positive, the, experience, feels, and, arousal, how, energized, or, enervated, the, experience, feels, these, two, dimensions, can, be, depicted, on, a, 2d, coordinate, map, this, two, dimensional, map, has, been, theorized, to, capture, one, important, component, of, emotion, called, core, affect, core, affect, is, not, theorized, to, be, the, only, component, to, emotion, but, to, give, the, emotion, its, hedonic, and, felt, energy, using, statistical, methods, to, analyze, emotional, states, elicited, by, short, videos, cowen, and, keltner, identified, 27, varieties, of, emotional, experience, admiration, adoration, aesthetic, appreciation, amusement, anger, anxiety, awe, awkwardness, boredom, calmness, confusion, craving, disgust, empathic, pain, entrancement, excitement, fear, horror, interest, joy, nostalgia, relief, romance, sadness, satisfaction, sexual, desire, and, surprise, in, hinduism, bharata, muni, enunciated, the, nine, rasas, emotions, in, the, n, tyas, stra, an, ancient, sanskrit, text, of, dramatic, theory, and, other, performance, arts, written, between, 200, bc, and, 200, ad, the, theory, of, rasas, still, forms, the, aesthetic, underpinning, of, all, indian, classical, dance, and, theatre, such, as, bharatanatyam, kathak, kuchipudi, odissi, manipuri, kudiyattam, kathakali, and,

aversion, bhay, nakam, horror, terror, veeram, pride, heroism, adbhutam, surprise, wonder, in, buddhism, emotions, occur, when, an, object, is, considered, attractive, or, repulsive, there, is, a, felt, tendency, impelling, people, towards, attractive, objects, and, propelling, them, to, move, away, from, repulsive, or, harmful, objects, a, disposition, to, possess, the, object, greed, to, destroy, it, hatred, to, flee, from, it, fear, to, get, obsessed, or, worried, over, it, anxiety, and, so, on, in, stoic, theories, normal, emotions, like, delight, and, fear, are, described, as, irrational, impulses, that, come, from, incorrect, appraisals, of, what, is, good, or, bad, alternatively, there, are, good, emotions, like, joy, and, caution, experienced, by, those, that, are, wise, which, come, from, correct, appraisals, of, what, is, good, and, bad, aristotle, believed, that, emotions, were, an, essential, component, of, virtue, in, the, aristotelian, view, all, emotions, called, passions, corresponded, to, appetites, or, capacities, during, the, middle, ages, the, aristotelian, view, was, adopted, and, further, developed, by, scholasticism, and, thomas, aquinas, in, particular, in, chinese, antiquity, excessive, emotion, was, believed, to, cause, damage, to, qi, which, in, turn, damages, the, vital, organs, the, four, humors, theory, made, popular, by, hippocrates, contributed, to, the, study, of, emotion, in, the, same, way, that, it, did, for, medicine, in, the, early, 11th, century, avicenna, theorized, about, the, influence, of, emotions, on, health, and, behaviors, suggesting, the, need, to, manage, emotions, early, modern, views, on, emotion, are, developed, in, the, works, of, philosophers, such, as, ren, descartes, niccol, machiavelli, baruch, spinoza, thomas, hobbes, and, david, hume, in, the, 19th, century, emotions, were, considered, adaptive, and, were, studied, more, frequently, from, an, empiricist, psychiatric, perspective, christian, perspective, on, emotion, presupposes, a, theistic, origin, to, humanity, god, who, created, humans, gave, humans, the, ability, to, feel, emotion, and, interact, emotionally, biblical, content, expresses, that, god, is, a, person, who, feels, and, expresses, emotion, though, a, somatic, view, would, place, the, locus, of, emotions, in, the, physical, body, christian, theory, of, emotions, would, view, the, body, more, as, a, platform, for, the, sensing, and, expression, of, emotions, therefore, emotions, themselves, arise, from, the, person, or, that, which, is, imago, dei, or, image, of, god, in, humans, in, christian, thought, emotions, have, the, potential, to, be, controlled, through, reasoned, reflection, that, reasoned, reflection, also, mimics, god, who, made, mind, the, purpose, of, emotions, in, human, life, is, therefore, summarized, in, god, s, call, to, enjoy, him, and, creation, humans, are, to, enjoy, emotions, and, benefit, from, them, and, use, them, to, energize, behavior, perspectives, on, emotions, from, evolutionary, theory, were, initiated, during, the, mid, late, 19th, century, with, charles, darwin, s, 1872, book, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, darwin, argued, that, emotions, served, no, evolved, purpose, for, humans, neither, in, communication, nor, in, aiding, survival, darwin, largely, argued, that, emotions, evolved, via, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characters, he, pioneered, various, methods, for, studying, non, verbal, expressions, from, which, he, concluded, that, some, expressions, had, cross, cultural, universality, darwin, also, detailed, homologous, expressions, of, emotions, that, occur, in, animals, this, led, the, way, for, animal, research, on, emotions, and, the, eventual, determination, of, the, neural, underpinnings, of, emotion, more, contemporary, views, along, the, evolutionary, psychology, spectrum, posit, that, both, basic, emotions, and, social, emotions, evolved, to, motivate, social, behaviors, that, were, adaptive, in, the, ancestral, environment, emotion, is, an, essential, part, of, any, human, decision, making, and, planning, and, the, famous, distinction, made, between, reason, and, emotion, is, not, as, clear, as, it, seems, paul, d, maclean, claims, that, emotion, competes, with, even, more, instinctive, responses, on, one, hand, and, the, more, abstract, reasoning, on, the, other, hand, the, increased, potential, in, neuroimaging, has, also, allowed, investigation, into, evolutionarily, ancient, parts, of, the, brain, important, neurological, advances, were, derived, from, these, perspectives, in, the, 1990s, by, joseph, e, ledoux, and, antonio, damasio, for, example, in, an, extensive, study, of, a, subject, with, ventromedial, frontal, lobe, damage, described, in, the, book, descartes, error, damasio, demonstrated, how, loss, of, physiological, capacity, for, emotion, resulted, in, the, subject, s, lost, capacity, to, make, decisions, despite, having, robust, faculties, for, rationally, assessing, options, research, on, physiological, emotion, has, caused, modern, neuroscience, to, abandon, the, model, of, emotions, and, rationality, as, opposing, forces, in, contrast, to, the, ancient, greek, ideal, of, dispassionate, reason, the, neuroscience, of, emotion, shows, that, emotion, is, necessarily, integrated, with, intellect, research, on, social, emotion, also, focuses, on, the, physical, displays, of, emotion, including, body, language, of, animals, and, humans, see, affect, display, for, example, spite, seems, to, work, against, the, individual, but, it, can, establish, an, individual, s, reputation, as, someone, to, be, feared, shame, and, pride, can, motivate, behaviors, that, help, one, maintain, one, s, standing, in, a, community, and, self, esteem, is, one, s, estimate, of, one, s, status, somatic, theories, of, emotion, claim, that, bodily, responses, rather, than, cognitive, interpretations, are, essential, to, emotions, the, first, modern, version, of, such, theories, came, from, william, james, in, the, 1880s, the, theory, lost, favor, in, the, 20th, century, but, has, regained, popularity, more, recently, due, largely, to, theorists, such, as, john, t, cacioppo, antonio, damasio, joseph, e, ledoux, and, robert, zajonc, who, are, able, to, appeal, to, neurological, evidence, in, his, 1884, article, william, james, argued, that, feelings, and, emotions, were, secondary, to, physiological, phenomena, in, his, theory, james, proposed, that, the, perception, of, what, he, called, an, exciting, fact, directly, led, to, a, physiological, response, known, as, emotion, to, account, for, different, types, of, emotional, experiences, james, proposed, that, stimuli, trigger, activity, in, the, autonomic, nervous, system, which, in, turn, produces, an, emotional, experience, in, the, brain, the, danish, psychologist, carl, lange, also, proposed, a, similar, theory, at, around, the, same, time, and, therefore, this, theory, became, known, as, the, james, lange, theory, as, james, wrote, the, perception, of, bodily, changes, as, they, occur, is, the, emotion, james, further, claims, that, we, feel, sad, because, we, cry, angry, because, we, strike, afraid, because, we, tremble, and, either, we, cry, strike, or, tremble, because, we, are, sorry, angry, or, fearful, as, the, case, may, be, an, example, of, this, theory, in, action, would, be, as, follows, an, emotion, evoking, stimulus, snake, triggers, a, pattern, of, physiological, response, increased, heart, rate, faster, breathing, etc, which, is, interpreted, as, a, particular, emotion, fear, this, theory, is, supported, by, experiments, in, which, by, manipulating, the, bodily, state, induces, a, desired, emotional, state, some, people, may, believe, that, emotions, give, rise, to, emotion, specific, actions, for, example, i, m, crying, because, i, m, sad, or, i, ran, away, because, i, was, scared, the, issue, with, the, james, lange, theory, is, that, of, causation, bodily, states, causing, emotions, and, being, a, priori, not, that, of, the, bodily, influences, on, emotional, experience, which, can, be, argued, and, is, still, quite, prevalent, today, in, biofeedback, studies, and, embodiment, theory, although, mostly, abandoned, in, its, original, form, tim, dalgleish, argues, that, most, contemporary, neuroscientists, have, embraced, the, components, of, the, james, lange, theory, of, emotions, the, james, lange, theory, has, remained, influential, its, main, contribution, is, the, emphasis, it, places, on, the, embodiment, of, emotions, especially, the, argument, that, changes, in, the, bodily, concomitants, of, emotions, can, alter, their, experienced, intensity, most, contemporary, neuroscientists, would, endorse, a, modified, james, lange, view, in, which, bodily, feedback, modulates, the, experience, of, emotion, p, 583, walter, bradford, cannon, agreed, that, physiological, responses, played, a, crucial, role, in, emotions, but, did, not, believe, that, physiological, responses, alone, could, explain, subjective, emotional, experiences, he, argued, that, physiological, responses, were, too, slow, and, often, imperceptible, and, this, could, not, account, for, the, relatively, rapid, and, intense, subjective, awareness, of, emotion, he, also, believed, that, the, richness, variety, and, temporal, course, of, emotional, experiences, could, not, stem, from, physiological, reactions, that, reflected, fairly, undifferentiated, fight, or, flight, responses, an, example, of, this, theory, in, action, is, as, follows, an, emotion, evoking, event, snake, triggers, simultaneously, both, a, physiological, response, and, a, conscious, experience, of, an, emotion, phillip, bard, contributed, to, the, theory, with, his, work, on, animals, bard, found, that, sensory, motor, and, physiological, information, all, had, to, pass, through, the, diencephalon, particularly, the, thalamus, before, being, subjected, to, any, further, processing, therefore, cannon, also, argued, that, it, was, not, anatomically, possible, for, sensory, events, to, trigger, a, physiological, response, prior, to, triggering, conscious, awareness, and, emotional, stimuli, had, to, trigger, both, physiological, and, experiential, aspects, of, emotion, simultaneously, stanley, schachter, formulated, his, theory, on, the, earlier, work, of, a, spanish, physician, gregorio, mara, n, who, injected, patients, with, epinephrine, and, subsequently, asked, them, how, they, felt, mara, n, found, that, most, of, these, patients, felt, something, but, in, the, absence, of, an, actual, emotion, evoking, stimulus, the, patients, were, unable, to, interpret, their, physiological, arousal, as, an, experienced, emotion, schachter, did, agree, that, physiological, reactions, played, a, big, role, in, emotions, he, suggested, that, physiological, reactions, contributed, to, emotional, experience, by, facilitating, a, focused, cognitive, appraisal, of, a, given, physiologically, arousing, event, and, that, this, appraisal, was, what, defined, the, subjective, emotional, experience, emotions, were, thus, a, result, of, two, stage, process, general, physiological, arousal, and, experience, of, emotion, for, example, the, physiological, arousal, heart, pounding, in, a, response, to, an, evoking, stimulus, the, sight, of, a, bear, in, the, kitchen, the, brain, then, quickly, scans, the, area, to, explain, the, pounding, and, notices, the, bear, consequently, the, brain, interprets, the, pounding, heart, as, being, the, result, of, fearing, the, bear, with, his, student, jerome, singer, schachter, demonstrated, that, subjects, can, have, different, emotional, reactions, despite, being, placed, into, the, same, physiological, state, with, an, injection, of, epinephrine, subjects, were, observed, to, express, either, anger, or, amusement, depending, on, whether, another, person, in, the, situation, a, confederate, displayed, that, emotion, hence, the, combination, of, the, appraisal, of, the, situation, cognitive, and, the, participants, reception, of, adrenalin, or, a, placebo, together, determined, the, response, this, experiment, has, been, criticized, in, jesse, prinz, s, 2004, gut, reactions, with, the, two, factor, theory, now, incorporating, cognition, several, theories, began, to, argue, that, cognitive, activity, in, the, form, of, judgments, evaluations, or, thoughts, were, entirely, necessary, for, an, emotion, to, occur, cognitive, theories, of, emotion, emphasize, that, emotions, are, shaped, by, how, individuals, interpret, and, appraise, situations, these, theories, highlight, these, theories, acknowledge, that, emotions, are, not, automatic, reactions, but, result, from, the, interplay, of, cognitive, interpretations, physiological, responses, and, the, social, context, a, prominent, philosophical, exponent, is, robert, c, solomon, for, example, the, passions, emotions, and, the, meaning, of, life, 1993, solomon, claims, that, emotions, are, judgments, he, has, put, forward, a, more, nuanced, view, which, responds, to, what, he, has, called, the, standard, objection, to, cognitivism, the, idea, that, a, judgment, that, something, is, fearsome, can, occur, with, or, without, emotion, so, judgment, cannot, be, identified, with, emotion, one, of, the, main, proponents, of, this, view, was, richard, lazarus, who, argued, that, emotions, must, have, some, cognitive, intentionality, the, cognitive, activity, involved, in, the, interpretation, of, an, emotional, context, may, be, conscious, or, unconscious, and, may, or, may, not, take, the, form, of, conceptual, processing, lazarus, theory, is, very, influential, emotion, is, a, disturbance, that, occurs, in, the, following, order, for, example, jenny, sees, a, snake, lazarus, stressed, that, the, quality, and, intensity, of, emotions, are, controlled, through, cognitive, processes, these, processes, underline, coping, strategies, that, form, the, emotional, reaction, by, altering, the, relationship, between, the, person, and, the, environment, george, mandler, provided, an, extensive, theoretical, and, empirical, discussion, of, emotion, as, influenced, by, cognition, consciousness, and, the, autonomic, nervous, system, in, two, books, mind, and, emotion, 1975, and, mind, and, body, psychology, of, emotion, and, stress, 1984, george, mandler, a, prominent, psychologist, known, for, his, contributions, to, the, study, of, cognition, and, emotion, proposed, the, two, process, theory, of, emotion, this, theory, offers, insights, into, how, emotions, are, generated, and, how, cognitive, processes, play, a, role, in, emotional, experiences, mandler, s, theory, focuses, on, the, interplay, between, primary, and, secondary, appraisal, processes, in, the, formation, of, emotions, here, are, the, key, components, of, his, theory, mandler, s, two, process, theory, of, emotion, emphasizes, the, importance, of, cognitive, appraisal, processes, in, shaping, emotional, experiences, it, recognizes, that, emotions, are, not, just, automatic, reactions, but, result, from, complex, evaluations, of, the, significance, of, situations, and, one, s, ability, to, manage, them, effectively, this, theory, underscores, the, role, of, cognition, in, the, emotional, process, and, highlights, the, interplay, of, cognitive, factors, in, the, formation, of, emotions, the, affect, infusion, model, aim, is, a, psychological, framework, that, was, developed, by, joseph, forgas, in, the, 1990s, this, model, focuses, on, how, affect, or, mood, and, emotions, can, influence, cognitive, processes, and, decision, making, the, central, idea, of, the, aim, is, that, affect, whether, it, is, a, positive, or, negative, mood, can, infuse, or, influence, various, cognitive, activities, including, information, processing, and, judgments, key, components, and, principles, of, the, affect, infusion, model, include, the, affect, infusion, model, has, been, applied, to, a, wide, range, of, areas, including, consumer, behavior, social, judgment, and, interpersonal, interactions, it, emphasizes, the, idea, that, emotions, and, mood, play, a, more, significant, role, in, cognitive, processes, and, decision, making, than, traditionally, thought, while, it, has, been, influential, in, understanding, the, interplay, between, affect, and, cognition, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, aim, is, just, one, of, several, models, in, the, field, of, emotion, and, cognition, that, help, explain, the, intricate, relationship, between, emotions, and, thinking, source, the, appraisal, tendency, theory, developed, by, joseph, p, forgas, is, a, theory, that, focuses, on, how, people, have, dispositional, tendencies, to, appraise, and, interpret, situations, in, specific, ways, leading, to, consistent, emotional, reactions, to, particular, types, of, situations, this, theory, suggests, that, certain, individuals, may, have, stable, habitual, patterns, of, appraising, and, attributing, emotional, significance, to, events, and, these, tendencies, can, influence, their, emotional, responses, and, judgments, key, features, and, concepts, of, the, appraisal, tendency, theory, include, appraisal, tendency, theory, suggests, that, these, cognitive, tendencies, can, shape, an, individual, s, overall, emotional, disposition, influencing, their, emotional, reactions, and, social, judgments, this, theory, has, been, applied, in, various, contexts, including, studies, of, personality, social, psychology, and, decision, making, to, better, understand, how, cognitive, appraisal, tendencies, influence, emotional, and, evaluative, responses, source, nico, frijda, was, a, prominent, psychologist, known, for, his, work, in, the, field, of, emotion, and, affective, science, one, of, the, key, contributions, of, frijda, are, his, laws, of, emotion, which, outline, a, set, of, principles, that, help, explain, how, emotions, function, and, how, they, are, experienced, frijda, s, laws, of, emotion, are, as, follows, frijda, s, theory, emphasizes, the, adaptive, function, of, emotions, and, the, role, of, cognitive, appraisal, in, shaping, emotional, experiences, it, highlights, that, emotions, are, not, simply, reactions, to, external, events, but, are, intimately, tied, to, the, individual, s, goals, values, and, perceptions, of, the, situation, s, meaning, frijda, s, work, has, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, study, of, emotions, and, has, contributed, to, a, more, comprehensive, understanding, of, how, emotions, operate, source, jesse, prinz, is, a, contemporary, philosopher, and, cognitive, scientist, who, has, contributed, to, the, field, of, emotion, theory, one, of, his, influential, theories, is, the, emotion, attribution, theory, which, provides, a, perspective, on, how, people, recognize, and, understand, emotions, in, themselves, and, others, emotion, attribution, theory, proposed, by, jesse, prinz, focuses, on, the, role, of, emotion, attributions, in, the, experience, and, understanding, of, emotions, key, ideas, and, components, of, prinz, s, theory, include, overall, prinz, s, emotion, attribution, theory, emphasizes, the, role, of, attributions, in, the, recognition, and, understanding, of, emotions, it, highlights, the, automatic, and, cognitive, processes, involved, in, identifying, and, interpreting, emotional, states, in, oneself, and, others, this, theory, has, implications, for, fields, such, as, psychology, philosophy, and, cognitive, science, and, contributes, to, our, understanding, of, the, social, and, cultural, aspects, of, emotions, source, the, affective, events, theory, aet, is, a, psychological, theory, that, focuses, on, the, role, of, workplace, events, in, shaping, employees, emotions, attitudes, and, behaviors, in, the, context, of, their, job, this, theory, was, developed, by, organizational, psychologists, howard, m, weiss, and, russell, cropanzano, in, the, late, 1990s, aet, primarily, concerns, itself, with, how, emotional, experiences, at, work, can, impact, job, satisfaction, performance, and, other, outcomes, key, concepts, and, principles, of, the, affective, events, theory, include, aet, has, been, influential, in, the, field, of, organizational, psychology, and, has, helped, shed, light, on, how, workplace, events, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, employee, well, being, and, organizational, outcomes, it, highlights, the, importance, of, understanding, and, managing, the, emotional, experiences, of, employees, in, the, context, of, their, work, a, situated, perspective, on, emotion, developed, by, paul, e, griffiths, and, andrea, scarantino, emphasizes, the, importance, of, external, factors, in, the, development, and, communication, of, emotion, drawing, upon, the, situationism, approach, in, psychology, this, theory, is, markedly, different, from, both, cognitivist, and, neo, jamesian, theories, of, emotion, both, of, which, see, emotion, as, a, purely, internal, process, with, the, environment, only, acting, as, a, stimulus, to, the, emotion, in, contrast, a, situationist, perspective, on, emotion, views, emotion, as, the, product, of, an, organism, investigating, its, environment, and, observing, the, responses, of, other, organisms, emotion, stimulates, the, evolution, of, social, relationships, acting, as, a, signal, to, mediate, the, behavior, of, other, organisms, in, some, contexts, the, expression, of, emotion, both, voluntary, and, involuntary, could, be, seen, as, strategic, moves, in, the, transactions, between, different, organisms, the, situated, perspective, on, emotion, states, that, conceptual, thought, is, not, an, inherent, part, of, emotion, since, emotion, is, an, action, oriented, form, of, skillful, engagement, with, the, world, griffiths, and, scarantino, suggested, that, this, perspective, on, emotion, could, be, helpful, in, understanding, phobias, as, well, as, the, emotions, of, infants, and, animals, emotions, can, motivate, social, interactions, and, relationships, and, therefore, are, directly, related, with, basic, physiology, particularly, with, the, stress, systems, this, is, important, because, emotions, are, related, to, the, anti, stress, complex, with, an, oxytocin, attachment, system, which, plays, a, major, role, in, bonding, emotional, phenotype, temperaments, affect, social, connectedness, and, fitness, in, complex, social, systems, these, characteristics, are, shared, with, other, species, and, taxa, and, are, due, to, the, effects, of, genes, and, their, continuous, transmission, information, that, is, encoded, in, the, dna, sequences, provides, the, blueprint, for, assembling, proteins, that, make, up, our, cells, zygotes, require, genetic, information, from, their, parental, germ, cells, and, at, every, speciation, event, heritable, traits, that, have, enabled, its, ancestor, to, survive, and, reproduce, successfully, are, passed, down, along, with, new, traits, that, could, be, potentially, beneficial, to, the, offspring, in, the, five, million, years, since, the, lineages, leading, to, modern, humans, and, chimpanzees, split, only, about, 1, 2, of, their, genetic, material, has, been, modified, this, suggests, that, everything, that, separates, us, from, chimpanzees, must, be, encoded, in, that, very, small, amount, of, dna, including, our, behaviors, students, that, study, animal, behaviors, have, only, identified, intraspecific, examples, of, gene, dependent, behavioral, phenotypes, in, voles, microtus, spp, minor, genetic, differences, have, been, identified, in, a, vasopressin, receptor, gene, that, corresponds, to, major, species, differences, in, social, organization, and, the, mating, system, another, potential, example, with, behavioral, differences, is, the, foxp2, gene, which, is, involved, in, neural, circuitry, handling, speech, and, language, its, present, form, in, humans, differed, from, that, of, the, chimpanzees, by, only, a, few, mutations, and, has, been, present, for, about, 200, 000, years, coinciding, with, the, beginning, of, modern, humans, speech, language, and, social, organization, are, all, part, of, the, basis, for, emotions, based, on, discoveries, made, through, neural, mapping, of, the, limbic, system, the, neurobiological, explanation, of, human, emotion, is, that, emotion, is, a, pleasant, or, unpleasant, mental, state, organized, in, the, limbic, system, of, the, mammalian, brain, if, distinguished, from, reactive, responses, of, reptiles, emotions, would, then, be, mammalian, elaborations, of, general, vertebrate, arousal, patterns, in, which, neurochemicals, for, example, dopamine, noradrenaline, and, serotonin, step, up, or, step, down, the, brain, s, activity, level, as, visible, in, body, movements, gestures, and, postures, emotions, can, likely, be, mediated, by, pheromones, see, fear, for, example, the, emotion, of, love, is, proposed, to, be, the, expression, of, paleocircuits, of, the, mammalian, brain, specifically, modules, of, the, cingulate, cortex, or, gyrus, which, facilitate, the, care, feeding, and, grooming, of, offspring, paleocircuits, are, neural, platforms, for, bodily, expression, configured, before, the, advent, of, cortical, circuits, for, speech, they, consist, of, pre, configured, pathways, or, networks, of, nerve, cells, in, the, forebrain, brainstem, and, spinal, cord, other, emotions, like, fear, and, anxiety, long, thought, to, be, exclusively, generated, by, the, most, primitive, parts, of, the, brain, stem, and, more, associated, to, the, fight, or, flight, responses, of, behavior, have, also, been, associated, as, adaptive, expressions, of, defensive, behavior, whenever, a, threat, is, encountered, although, defensive, behaviors, have, been, present, in, a, wide, variety, of, species, blanchard, et, al, 2001, discovered, a, correlation, of, given, stimuli, and, situation, that, resulted, in, a, similar, pattern, of, defensive, behavior, towards, a, threat, in, human, and, non, human, mammals, whenever, potentially, dangerous, stimuli, are, presented, additional, brain, structures, activate, that, previous, thought, hippocampus, thalamus, etc, thus, giving, the, amygdala, an, important, role, in, coordinating, the, following, behavioral, input, based, on, the, presented, neurotransmitters, that, respond, to, threat, stimuli, these, biological, functions, of, the, amygdala, are, not, only, limited, to, the, fear, conditioning, and, processing, of, aversive, stimuli, but, also, are, present, on, other, components, of, the, amygdala, therefore, it, can, referred, the, amygdala, as, a, key, structure, to, understand, the, potential, responses, of, behavior, in, danger, like, situations, in, human, and, non, human, mammals, the, motor, centers, of, reptiles, react, to, sensory, cues, of, vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and, motion, with, pre, set, body, movements, and, programmed, postures, with, the, arrival, of, night, active, mammals, smell, replaced, vision, as, the, dominant, sense, and, a, different, way, of, responding, arose, from, the, olfactory, sense, which, is, proposed, to, have, developed, into, mammalian, emotion, and, emotional, memory, the, mammalian, brain, invested, heavily, in, olfaction, to, succeed, at, night, as, reptiles, slept, one, explanation, for, why, olfactory, lobes, in, mammalian, brains, are, proportionally, larger, than, in, the, reptiles, these, odor, pathways, gradually, formed, the, neural, blueprint, for, what, was, later, to, become, our, limbic, brain, emotions, are, thought, to, be, related, to, certain, activities, in, brain, areas, that, direct, our, attention, motivate, our, behavior, and, determine, the, significance, of, what, is, going, on, around, us, pioneering, work, by, paul, broca, 1878, james, papez, 1937, and, paul, d, maclean, 1952, suggested, that, emotion, is, related, to, a, group, of, structures, in, the, center, of, the, brain, called, the, limbic, system, which, includes, the, hypothalamus, cingulate, cortex, hippocampi, and, other, structures, more, recent, research, has, shown, that, some, of, these, limbic, structures, are, not, as, directly, related, to, emotion, as, others, are, while, some, non, limbic, structures, have, been, found, to, be, of, greater, emotional, relevance, there, is, ample, evidence, that, the, left, prefrontal, cortex, is, activated, by, stimuli, that, cause, positive, approach, if, attractive, stimuli, can, selectively, activate, a, region, of, the, brain, then, logically, the, converse, should, hold, that, selective, activation, of, that, region, of, the, brain, should, cause, a, stimulus, to, be, judged, more, positively, this, was, demonstrated, for, moderately, attractive, visual, stimuli, and, replicated, and, extended, to, include, negative, stimuli, two, neurobiological, models, of, emotion, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, made, opposing, predictions, the, valence, model, predicted, that, anger, a, negative, emotion, would, activate, the, right, prefrontal, cortex, the, direction, model, predicted, that, anger, an, approach, emotion, would, activate, the, left, prefrontal, cortex, the, second, model, was, supported, this, still, left, open, the, question, of, whether, the, opposite, of, approach, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, is, better, described, as, moving, away, direction, model, as, unmoving, but, with, strength, and, resistance, movement, model, or, as, unmoving, with, passive, yielding, action, tendency, model, support, for, the, action, tendency, model, passivity, related, to, right, prefrontal, activity, comes, from, research, on, shyness, and, research, on, behavioral, inhibition, research, that, tested, the, competing, hypotheses, generated, by, all, four, models, also, supported, the, action, tendency, model, another, neurological, approach, proposed, by, bud, craig, in, 2003, distinguishes, two, classes, of, emotion, classical, emotions, such, as, love, anger, and, fear, that, are, evoked, by, environmental, stimuli, and, homeostatic, emotions, attention, demanding, feelings, evoked, by, body, states, such, as, pain, hunger, and, fatigue, that, motivate, behavior, withdrawal, eating, or, resting, in, these, examples, aimed, at, maintaining, the, body, s, internal, milieu, at, its, ideal, state, derek, denton, calls, the, latter, primordial, emotions, and, defines, them, as, the, subjective, element, of, the, instincts, which, are, the, genetically, programmed, behavior, patterns, which, contrive, homeostasis, they, include, thirst, hunger, for, air, hunger, for, food, pain, and, hunger, for, specific, minerals, etc, there, are, two, constituents, of, a, primordial, emotion, the, specific, sensation, which, when, severe, may, be, imperious, and, the, compelling, intention, for, gratification, by, a, consummatory, act, emotions, are, seen, by, some, researchers, to, be, constructed, emerge, in, social, and, cognitive, domain, alone, without, directly, implying, biologically, inherited, characteristics, joseph, ledoux, differentiates, between, the, human, s, defense, system, which, has, evolved, over, time, and, emotions, such, as, fear, and, anxiety, he, has, said, that, the, amygdala, may, release, hormones, due, to, a, trigger, such, as, an, innate, reaction, to, seeing, a, snake, but, then, we, elaborate, it, through, cognitive, and, conscious, processes, lisa, feldman, barrett, highlights, differences, in, emotions, between, different, cultures, and, says, that, emotions, such, as, anxiety, are, socially, constructed, see, theory, of, constructed, emotion, she, says, that, they, are, not, triggered, you, create, them, they, emerge, as, a, combination, of, the, physical, properties, of, your, body, a, flexible, brain, that, wires, itself, to, whatever, environment, it, develops, in, and, your, culture, and, upbringing, which, provide, that, environment, she, has, termed, this, approach, the, theory, of, constructed, emotion, many, different, disciplines, have, produced, work, on, the, emotions, human, sciences, study, the, role, of, emotions, in, mental, processes, disorders, and, neural, mechanisms, in, psychiatry, emotions, are, examined, as, part, of, the, discipline, s, study, and, treatment, of, mental, disorders, in, humans, nursing, studies, emotions, as, part, of, its, approach, to, the, provision, of, holistic, health, care, to, humans, psychology, examines, emotions, from, a, scientific, perspective, by, treating, them, as, mental, processes, and, behavior, and, they, explore, the, underlying, physiological, and, neurological, processes, e, g, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, in, neuroscience, sub, fields, such, as, social, neuroscience, and, affective, neuroscience, scientists, study, the, neural, mechanisms, of, emotion, by, combining, neuroscience, with, the, psychological, study, of, personality, emotion, and, mood, in, linguistics, the, expression, of, emotion, may, change, to, the, meaning, of, sounds, in, education, the, role, of, emotions, in, relation, to, learning, is, examined, social, sciences, often, examine, emotion, for, the, role, that, it, plays, in, human, culture, and, social, interactions, in, sociology, emotions, are, examined, for, the, role, they, play, in, human, society, social, patterns, and, interactions, and, culture, in, anthropology, the, study, of, humanity, scholars, use, ethnography, to, undertake, contextual, analyzes, and, cross, cultural, comparisons, of, a, range, of, human, activities, some, anthropology, studies, examine, the, role, of, emotions, in, human, activities, in, the, field, of, communication, studies, critical, organizational, scholars, have, examined, the, role, of, emotions, in, organizations, from, the, perspectives, of, managers, employees, and, even, customers, a, focus, on, emotions, in, organizations, can, be, credited, to, arlie, russell, hochschild, s, concept, of, emotional, labor, the, university, of, queensland, hosts, emonet, an, e, mail, distribution, list, representing, a, network, of, academics, that, facilitates, scholarly, discussion, of, all, matters, relating, to, the, study, of, emotion, in, organizational, settings, the, list, was, established, in, january, 1997, and, has, over, 700, members, from, across, the, globe, in, economics, the, social, science, that, studies, the, production, distribution, and, consumption, of, goods, and, services, emotions, are, analyzed, in, some, sub, fields, of, microeconomics, in, order, to, assess, the, role, of, emotions, on, purchase, decision, making, and, risk, perception, in, criminology, a, social, science, approach, to, the, study, of, crime, scholars, often, draw, on, behavioral, sciences, sociology, and, psychology, emotions, are, examined, in, criminology, issues, such, as, anomie, theory, and, studies, of, toughness, aggressive, behavior, and, hooliganism, in, law, which, underpins, civil, obedience, politics, economics, and, society, evidence, about, people, s, emotions, is, often, raised, in, tort, law, claims, for, compensation, and, in, criminal, law, prosecutions, against, alleged, lawbreakers, as, evidence, of, the, defendant, s, state, of, mind, during, trials, sentencing, and, parole, hearings, in, political, science, emotions, are, examined, in, a, number, of, sub, fields, such, as, the, analysis, of, voter, decision, making, in,

state, of, the, authors, of, historical, documents, is, one, of, the, tools, of, interpretation, in, literature, and, film, making, the, expression, of, emotion, is, the, cornerstone, of, genres, such, as, drama, melodrama, and, romance, in, communication, studies, scholars, study, the, role, that, emotion, plays, in, the, dissemination, of, ideas, and, messages, emotion, is, also, studied, in, non, human, animals, in, ethology, a, branch, of, zoology, which, focuses, on, the, scientific, study, of, animal, behavior, ethology, is, a, combination, of, laboratory, and, field, science, with, strong, ties, to, ecology, and, evolution, ethologists, often, study, one, type, of, behavior, for, example, aggression, in, a, number, of, unrelated, animals, the, history, of, emotions, has, become, an, increasingly, popular, topic, recently, with, some, scholars, arguing, that, it, is, an, essential, category, of, analysis, not, unlike, class, race, or, gender, historians, like, other, social, scientists, assume, that, emotions, feelings, and, their, expressions, are, regulated, in, different, ways, by, both, different, cultures, and, different, historical, times, and, the, constructivist, school, of, history, claims, even, that, some, sentiments, and, meta, emotions, for, example, schadenfreude, are, learnt, and, not, only, regulated, by, culture, historians, of, emotion, trace, and, analyze, the, changing, norms, and, rules, of, feeling, while, examining, emotional, regimes, codes, and, lexicons, from, social, cultural, or, political, history, perspectives, others, focus, on, the, history, of, medicine, science, or, psychology, what, somebody, can, and, may, feel, and, show, in, a, given, situation, towards, certain, people, or, things, depends, on, social, norms, and, rules, thus, historically, variable, and, open, to, change, several, research, centers, have, opened, in, the, past, few, years, in, germany, england, spain, sweden, and, australia, furthermore, research, in, historical, trauma, suggests, that, some, traumatic, emotions, can, be, passed, on, from, parents, to, offspring, to, second, and, even, third, generation, presented, as, examples, of, transgenerational, trauma, a, common, way, in, which, emotions, are, conceptualized, in, sociology, is, in, terms, of, the, multidimensional, characteristics, including, cultural, or, emotional, labels, for, example, anger, pride, fear, happiness, physiological, changes, for, example, increased, perspiration, changes, in, pulse, rate, expressive, facial, and, body, movements, for, example, smiling, frowning, baring, teeth, and, appraisals, of, situational, cues, one, comprehensive, theory, of, emotional, arousal, in, humans, has, been, developed, by, jonathan, turner, 2007, 2009, two, of, the, key, eliciting, factors, for, the, arousal, of, emotions, within, this, theory, are, expectations, states, and, sanctions, when, people, enter, a, situation, or, encounter, with, certain, expectations, for, how, the, encounter, should, unfold, they, will, experience, different, emotions, depending, on, the, extent, to, which, expectations, for, self, other, and, situation, are, met, or, not, met, people, can, also, provide, positive, or, negative, sanctions, directed, at, self, or, other, which, also, trigger, different, emotional, experiences, in, individuals, turner, analyzed, a, wide, range, of, emotion, theories, across, different, fields, of, research, including, sociology, psychology, evolutionary, science, and, neuroscience, based, on, this, analysis, he, identified, four, emotions, that, all, researchers, consider, being, founded, on, human, neurology, including, assertive, anger, aversion, fear, satisfaction, happiness, and, disappointment, sadness, these, four, categories, are, called, primary, emotions, and, there, is, some, agreement, amongst, researchers, that, these, primary, emotions, become, combined, to, produce, more, elaborate, and, complex, emotional, experiences, these, more, elaborate, emotions, are, called, first, order, elaborations, in, turner, s, theory, and, they, include, sentiments, such, as, pride, triumph, and, awe, emotions, can, also, be, experienced, at, different, levels, of, intensity, so, that, feelings, of, concern, are, a, low, intensity, variation, of, the, primary, emotion, aversion, fear, whereas, depression, is, a, higher, intensity, variant, attempts, are, frequently, made, to, regulate, emotion, according, to, the, conventions, of, the, society, and, the, situation, based, on, many, sometimes, conflicting, demands, and, expectations, which, originate, from, various, entities, the, expression, of, anger, is, in, many, cultures, discouraged, in, girls, and, women, to, a, greater, extent, than, in, boys, and, men, the, notion, being, that, an, angry, man, has, a, valid, complaint, that, needs, to, be, rectified, while, an, angry, women, is, hysterical, or, oversensitive, and, her, anger, is, somehow, invalid, while, the, expression, of, sadness, or, fear, is, discouraged, in, boys, and, men, relative, to, girls, and, women, attitudes, implicit, in, phrases, like, man, up, or, don, t, be, a, sissy, expectations, attached, to, social, roles, such, as, acting, as, man, and, not, as, a, woman, and, the, accompanying, feeling, rules, contribute, to, the, differences, in, expression, of, certain, emotions, some, cultures, encourage, or, discourage, happiness, sadness, or, jealousy, and, the, free, expression, of, the, emotion, of, disgust, is, considered, socially, unacceptable, in, most, cultures, some, social, institutions, are, seen, as, based, on, certain, emotion, such, as, love, in, the, case, of, contemporary, institution, of, marriage, in, advertising, such, as, health, campaigns, and, political, messages, emotional, appeals, are, commonly, found, recent, examples, include, no, smoking, health, campaigns, and, political, campaigns, emphasizing, the, fear, of, terrorism, sociological, attention, to, emotion, has, varied, over, time, mile, durkheim, 1915, 1965, wrote, about, the, collective, effervescence, or, emotional, energy, that, was, experienced, by, members, of, totemic, rituals, in, australian, aboriginal, society, he, explained, how, the, heightened, state, of, emotional, energy, achieved, during, totemic, rituals, transported, individuals, above, themselves, giving, them, the, sense, that, they, were, in, the, presence, of, a, higher, power, a, force, that, was, embedded, in, the, sacred, objects, that, were, worshipped, these, feelings, of, exaltation, he, argued, ultimately, lead, people, to, believe, that, there, were, forces, that, governed, sacred, objects, in, the, 1990s, sociologists, focused, on, different, aspects, of, specific, emotions, and, how, these, emotions, were, socially, relevant, for, cooley, 1992, pride, and, shame, were, the, most, important, emotions, that, drive, people, to, take, various, social, actions, during, every, encounter, he, proposed, that, we, monitor, ourselves, through, the, looking, glass, that, the, gestures, and, reactions, of, others, provide, depending, on, these, reactions, we, either, experience, pride, or, shame, and, this, results, in, particular, paths, of, action, retzinger, 1991, conducted, studies, of, married, couples, who, experienced, cycles, of, rage, and, shame, drawing, predominantly, on, goffman, and, cooley, s, work, scheff, 1990, developed, a, micro, sociological, theory, of, the, social, bond, the, formation, or, disruption, of, social, bonds, is, dependent, on, the, emotions, that, people, experience, during, interactions, subsequent, to, these, developments, randall, collins, 2004, formulated, his, interaction, ritual, theory, by, drawing, on, durkheim, s, work, on, totemic, rituals, that, was, extended, by, goffman, 1964, 2013, 1967, into, everyday, focused, encounters, based, on, interaction, ritual, theory, we, experience, different, levels, or, intensities, of, emotional, energy, during, face, to, face, interactions, emotional, energy, is, considered, to, be, a, feeling, of, confidence, to, take, action, and, a, boldness, that, one, experiences, when, they, are, charged, up, from, the, collective, effervescence, generated, during, group, gatherings, that, reach, high, levels, of, intensity, there, is, a, growing, body, of, research, applying, the, sociology, of, emotion, to, understanding, the, learning, experiences, of, students, during, classroom, interactions, with, teachers, and, other, students, for, example, milne, otieno, 2007, olitsky, 2007, tobin, et, al, 2013, zembylas, 2002, these, studies, show, that, learning, subjects, like, science, can, be, understood, in, terms, of, classroom, interaction, rituals, that, generate, emotional, energy, and, collective, states, of, emotional, arousal, like, emotional, climate, apart, from, interaction, ritual, traditions, of, the, sociology, of, emotion, other, approaches, have, been, classed, into, one, of, six, other, categories, this, list, provides, a, general, overview, of, different, traditions, in, the, sociology, of, emotion, that, sometimes, conceptualize, emotion, in, different, ways, and, at, other, times, in, complementary, ways, many, of, these, different, approaches, were, synthesized, by, turner, 2007, in, his, sociological, theory, of, human, emotions, in, an, attempt, to, produce, one, comprehensive, sociological, account, that, draws, on, developments, from, many, of, the, above, traditions, emotion, regulation, refers, to, the, cognitive, and, behavioral, strategies, people, use, to, influence, their, own, emotional, experience, for, example, a, behavioral, strategy, in, which, one, avoids, a, situation, to, avoid, unwanted, emotions, trying, not, to, think, about, the, situation, doing, distracting, activities, etc, depending, on, the, particular, school, s, general, emphasis, on, either, cognitive, components, of, emotion, physical, energy, discharging, or, on, symbolic, movement, and, facial, expression, components, of, emotion, different, schools, of, psychotherapy, approach, the, regulation, of, emotion, differently, cognitively, oriented, schools, approach, them, via, their, cognitive, components, such, as, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, yet, others, approach, emotions, via, symbolic, movement, and, facial, expression, components, like, in, contemporary, gestalt, therapy, research, on, emotions, reveals, the, strong, presence, of, cross, cultural, differences, in, emotional, reactions, and, that, emotional, reactions, are, likely, to, be, culture, specific, in, strategic, settings, cross, cultural, research, on, emotions, is, required, for, understanding, the, psychological, situation, of, a, given, population, or, specific, actors, this, implies, the, need, to, comprehend, the, current, emotional, state, mental, disposition, or, other, behavioral, motivation, of, a, target, audience, located, in, a, different, culture, basically, founded, on, its, national, political, social, economic, and, psychological, peculiarities, but, also, subject, to, the, influence, of, circumstances, and, events, in, the, 2000s, research, in, computer, science, engineering, psychology, and, neuroscience, has, been, aimed, at, developing, devices, that, recognize, human, affect, display, and, model, emotions, in, computer, science, affective, computing, is, a, branch, of, the, study, and, development, of, artificial, intelligence, that, deals, with, the, design, of, systems, and, devices, that, can, recognize, interpret, and, process, human, emotions, it, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, spanning, computer, sciences, psychology, and, cognitive, science, while, the, origins, of, the, field, may, be, traced, as, far, back, as, to, early, philosophical, enquiries, into, emotion, the, more, modern, branch, of, computer, science, originated, with, rosalind, picard, s, 1995, paper, on, affective, computing, detecting, emotional, information, begins, with, passive, sensors, which, capture, data, about, the, user, s, physical, state, or, behavior, without, interpreting, the, input, the, data, gathered, is, analogous, to, the, cues, humans, use, to, perceive, emotions, in, others, another, area, within, affective, computing, is, the, design, of, computational, devices, proposed, to, exhibit, either, innate, emotional, capabilities, or, that, are, capable, of, convincingly, simulating, emotions, emotional, speech, processing, recognizes, the, user, s, emotional, state, by, analyzing, speech, patterns, the, detection, and, processing, of, facial, expression, or, body, gestures, is, achieved, through, detectors, and, sensors, emotion, affects, the, way, autobiographical, memories, are, encoded, and, retrieved, emotional, memories, are, reactivated, more, they, are, remembered, better, and, have, more, attention, devoted, to, them, through, remembering, our, past, achievements, and, failures, autobiographical, memories, affect, how, we, perceive, and,

experiences, in, the, world, the, autonomic, nervous, system, creates, physiological, events, such, as, muscular, tension, a, rise, in, heart, rate, perspiration, and, dryness, of, the, mouth, emotions, then, are, feelings, which, come, about, as, a, result, of, these, physiological, changes, rather, than, being, their, cause, silvan, tomkins, 1911, 1991, developed, the, affect, theory, and, script, theory, the, affect, theory, introduced, the, concept, of, basic, emotions, and, was, based, on, the, idea, that, the, dominance, of, the, emotion, which, he, called, the, affected, system, was, the, motivating, force, in, human, life, some, of, the, most, influential, deceased, theorists, on, emotion, from, the, 20th, century, include, magda, b, arnold, 1903, 2002, an, american,
