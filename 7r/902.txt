a, siege, latin, sedere, lit, to, sit, is, a, military, blockade, of, a, city, or, fortress, with, the, intent, of, conquering, by, attrition, or, by, well, prepared, assault, siege, warfare, also, called, siegecraft, or, poliorcetics, is, a, form, of, constant, low, intensity, conflict, characterized, by, one, party, holding, a, strong, static, defensive, position, consequently, an, opportunity, for, negotiation, between, combatants, is, common, as, proximity, and, fluctuating, advantage, can, encourage, diplomacy, a, siege, occurs, when, an, attacker, encounters, a, city, or, fortress, that, cannot, be, easily, taken, by, a, quick, assault, and, which, refuses, to, surrender, sieges, involve, surrounding, the, target, to, block, provision, of, supplies, and, reinforcement, or, escape, of, troops, a, tactic, known, as, investment, this, is, typically, coupled, with, attempts, to, reduce, the, fortifications, by, means, of, siege, engines, artillery, bombardment, mining, also, known, as, sapping, or, the, use, of, deception, or, treachery, to, bypass, defenses, failing, a, military, outcome, sieges, can, often, be, decided, by, starvation, thirst, or, disease, which, can, afflict, either, the, attacker, or, defender, this, form, of, siege, though, can, take, many, months, or, even, years, depending, upon, the, size, of, the, stores, of, food, the, fortified, position, holds, the, attacking, force, can, circumvallate, the, besieged, place, which, is, to, build, a, line, of, earth, works, consisting, of, a, rampart, and, trench, surrounding, it, during, the, process, of, circumvallation, the, attacking, force, can, be, set, upon, by, another, force, an, ally, of, the, besieged, place, due, to, the, lengthy, amount, of, time, required, to, force, it, to, capitulate, a, defensive, ring, of, forts, outside, the, ring, of, circumvallated, forts, called, contravallation, is, also, sometimes, used, to, defend, the, attackers, from, outside, ancient, cities, in, the, middle, east, show, archaeological, evidence, of, fortified, city, walls, during, the, warring, states, period, of, ancient, china, there, is, both, textual, and, archaeological, evidence, of, prolonged, sieges, and, siege, machinery, used, against, the, defenders, of, city, walls, siege, machinery, was, also, a, tradition, of, the, ancient, greco, roman, world, during, the, renaissance, and, the, early, modern, period, siege, warfare, dominated, the, conduct, of, war, in, europe, leonardo, da, vinci, gained, some, of, his, renown, from, design, of, fortifications, medieval, campaigns, were, generally, designed, around, a, succession, of, sieges, in, the, napoleonic, era, increasing, use, of, ever, more, powerful, cannons, reduced, the, value, of, fortifications, in, the, 20th, century, the, significance, of, the, classical, siege, declined, with, the, advent, of, mobile, warfare, a, single, fortified, stronghold, is, no, longer, as, decisive, as, it, once, was, while, traditional, sieges, do, still, occur, they, are, not, as, common, as, they, once, were, due, to, changes, in, modes, of, battle, principally, the, ease, by, which, huge, volumes, of, destructive, power, can, be, directed, onto, a, static, target, modern, sieges, are, more, commonly, the, result, of, smaller, hostage, militant, or, extreme, resisting, arrest, situations, the, assyrians, deployed, large, labour, forces, to, build, new, palaces, temples, and, defensive, walls, some, settlements, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, were, also, fortified, by, about, 3500, bc, hundreds, of, small, farming, villages, dotted, the, indus, river, floodplain, many, of, these, settlements, had, fortifications, and, planned, streets, the, stone, and, mud, brick, houses, of, kot, diji, were, clustered, behind, massive, stone, flood, dikes, and, defensive, walls, for, neighbouring, communities, quarrelled, constantly, about, the, control, of, prime, agricultural, land, mundigak, c, 2500, bc, in, present, day, south, east, afghanistan, has, defensive, walls, and, square, bastions, of, sun, dried, bricks, city, walls, and, fortifications, were, essential, for, the, defence, of, the, first, cities, in, the, ancient, near, east, the, walls, were, built, of, mudbricks, stone, wood, or, a, combination, of, these, materials, depending, on, local, availability, they, may, also, have, served, the, dual, purpose, of, showing, potential, enemies, the, might, of, the, kingdom, the, great, walls, surrounding, the, sumerian, city, of, uruk, gained, a, widespread, reputation, the, walls, were, 9, 5, km, 5, 9, mi, in, length, and, up, to, 12, m, 39, ft, in, height, later, the, walls, of, babylon, reinforced, by, towers, moats, and, ditches, gained, a, similar, reputation, in, anatolia, the, hittites, built, massive, stone, walls, around, their, cities, atop, hillsides, taking, advantage, of, the, terrain, in, shang, dynasty, china, at, the, site, of, ao, large, walls, were, erected, in, the, 15th, century, bc, that, had, dimensions, of, 20, m, 66, ft, in, width, at, the, base, and, enclosed, an, area, of, some, 1, 900, m, 2, 100, yd, squared, the, ancient, chinese, capital, for, the, state, of, zhao, handan, founded, in, 386, bc, also, had, walls, that, were, 20, m, 66, ft, wide, at, the, base, they, were, 15, m, 49, ft, tall, with, two, separate, sides, of, its, rectangular, enclosure, at, a, length, of, 1, 400, m, 1, 530, yd, the, cities, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, showed, less, effort, in, constructing, defences, as, did, the, minoan, civilization, on, crete, these, civilizations, probably, relied, more, on, the, defence, of, their, outer, borders, or, sea, shores, unlike, the, ancient, minoan, civilization, the, mycenaean, greeks, emphasized, the, need, for, fortifications, alongside, natural, defences, of, mountainous, terrain, such, as, the, massive, cyclopean, walls, built, at, mycenae, and, other, adjacent, late, bronze, age, c, 1600, 1100, bc, centers, of, central, and, southern, greece, although, there, are, depictions, of, sieges, from, the, ancient, near, east, in, historical, sources, and, in, art, there, are, very, few, examples, of, siege, systems, that, have, been, found, archaeologically, of, the, few, examples, several, are, noteworthy, the, earliest, representations, of, siege, warfare, have, been, dated, to, the, protodynastic, period, of, egypt, c, 3000, bc, these, show, the, symbolic, destruction, of, city, walls, by, divine, animals, using, hoes, the, first, siege, equipment, is, known, from, egyptian, tomb, reliefs, of, the, 24th, century, bc, showing, egyptian, soldiers, storming, canaanite, town, walls, on, wheeled, siege, ladders, later, egyptian, temple, reliefs, of, the, 13th, century, bc, portray, the, violent, siege, of, dapur, a, syrian, city, with, soldiers, climbing, scale, ladders, supported, by, archers, assyrian, palace, reliefs, of, the, 9th, to, 7th, centuries, bc, display, sieges, of, several, near, eastern, cities, though, a, simple, battering, ram, had, come, into, use, in, the, previous, millennium, the, assyrians, improved, siege, warfare, and, used, huge, wooden, tower, shaped, battering, rams, with, archers, positioned, on, top, in, ancient, china, sieges, of, city, walls, along, with, naval, battles, were, portrayed, on, bronze, hu, vessels, like, those, found, in, chengdu, sichuan, in, 1965, which, have, been, dated, to, the, warring, states, period, 5th, to, 3rd, centuries, bc, an, attacker, s, first, act, in, a, siege, might, be, a, surprise, attack, attempting, to, overwhelm, the, defenders, before, they, were, ready, or, were, even, aware, there, was, a, threat, this, was, how, william, de, forz, captured, fotheringhay, castle, in, 1221, the, most, common, practice, of, siege, warfare, was, to, lay, siege, and, just, wait, for, the, surrender, of, the, enemies, inside, or, quite, commonly, to, coerce, someone, inside, to, betray, the, fortification, during, the, medieval, period, negotiations, would, frequently, take, place, during, the, early, part, of, the, siege, an, attacker, aware, of, a, prolonged, siege, s, great, cost, in, time, money, and, lives, might, offer, generous, terms, to, a, defender, who, surrendered, quickly, the, defending, troops, would, be, allowed, to, march, away, unharmed, often, retaining, their, weapons, however, a, garrison, commander, who, was, thought, to, have, surrendered, too, quickly, might, face, execution, by, his, own, side, for, treason, as, a, siege, progressed, the, surrounding, army, would, build, earthworks, a, line, of, circumvallation, to, completely, encircle, their, target, preventing, food, water, and, other, supplies, from, reaching, the, besieged, city, if, sufficiently, desperate, as, the, siege, progressed, defenders, and, civilians, might, have, been, reduced, to, eating, anything, vaguely, edible, horses, family, pets, the, leather, from, shoes, and, even, each, other, the, hittite, siege, of, a, rebellious, anatolian, vassal, in, the, 14th, century, bc, ended, when, the, queen, mother, came, out, of, the, city, and, begged, for, mercy, on, behalf, of, her, people, the, hittite, campaign, against, the, kingdom, of, mitanni, in, the, 14th, century, bc, bypassed, the, fortified, city, of, carchemish, if, the, main, objective, of, a, campaign, was, not, the, conquest, of, a, particular, city, it, could, simply, be, passed, by, when, the, main, objective, of, the, campaign, had, been, fulfilled, the, hittite, army, returned, to, carchemish, and, the, city, fell, after, an, eight, day, siege, disease, was, another, effective, siege, weapon, although, the, attackers, were, often, as, vulnerable, as, the, defenders, in, some, instances, catapults, or, similar, weapons, were, used, to, fling, diseased, animals, over, city, walls, in, an, early, example, of, biological, warfare, if, all, else, failed, a, besieger, could, claim, the, booty, of, his, conquest, undamaged, and, retain, his, men, and, equipment, intact, for, the, price, of, a, well, placed, bribe, to, a, disgruntled, gatekeeper, the, assyrian, siege, of, jerusalem, in, the, 8th, century, bc, came, to, an, end, when, the, israelites, bought, them, off, with, gifts, and, tribute, according, to, the, assyrian, account, or, when, the, assyrian, camp, was, struck, by, mass, death, according, to, the, biblical, account, due, to, logistics, long, lasting, sieges, involving, a, minor, force, could, seldom, be, maintained, a, besieging, army, encamped, in, possibly, squalid, field, conditions, and, dependent, on, the, countryside, and, its, own, supply, lines, for, food, could, very, well, be, threatened, with, the, disease, and, starvation, intended, for, the, besieged, to, end, a, siege, more, rapidly, various, methods, were, developed, in, ancient, and, medieval, times, to, counter, fortifications, and, a, large, variety, of, siege, engines, was, developed, for, use, by, besieging, armies, ladders, could, be, used, to, escalade, over, the, defenses, battering, rams, and, siege, hooks, could, also, be, used, to, force, through, gates, or, walls, while, catapults, ballistae, trebuchets, mangonels, and, onagers, could, be, used, to, launch, projectiles, to, break, down, a, city, s, fortifications, and, kill, its, defenders, a, siege, tower, a, substantial, structure, built, to, equal, or, greater, height, than, the, fortification, s, walls, could, allow, the, attackers, to, fire, down, upon, the, defenders, and, also, advance, troops, to, the, wall, with, less, danger, than, using, ladders, in, addition, to, launching, projectiles, at, the, fortifications, or, defenders, it, was, also, quite, common, to, attempt, to, undermine, the, fortifications, causing, them, to, collapse, this, could, be, accomplished, by, digging, a, tunnel, beneath, the, foundations, of, the, walls, and, then, deliberately, collapsing, or, exploding, the, tunnel, this, process, is, known, as, mining, the, defenders, could, dig, counter, tunnels, to, cut, into, the, attackers, works, and, collapse, them, prematurely, fire, was, often, used, as, a, weapon, when, dealing, with, wooden, fortifications, the, roman, empire, used, greek, fire, which, contained, additives, that, made, it, hard, to, extinguish, combined, with, a, primitive, flamethrower, it, proved, an, effective, offensive, and, defensive, weapon, a, sallying, out, might, also, occur, with, such, weapons, or, if, the, siege, was, of, a, location, on, a, coastline, from, ships, launched, from, the, harbor, of, the, location, the, universal, method, for, defending, against, siege, is, the, use, of, fortifications, principally, walls, and, ditches, to, supplement, natural, features, a, sufficient, supply, of, food, and, water, was, also, important, to, defeat, the, simplest, method, of, siege, warfare, starvation, on, occasion, the, defenders, would, drive, surplus, civilians, out, to, reduce, the, demands, on, stored, food, and, water, during, the, warring, states, period, in, china, 481, 221, bc, warfare, lost, its, honorable, gentlemen, s, duty, that, was, found, in, the, previous, era, of, the, spring, and, autumn, period, and, became, more, practical, competitive, cut, throat, and, efficient, for, gaining, victory, the, chinese, invention, of, the, hand, held, trigger, mechanism, crossbow, during, this, period, revolutionized, warfare, giving, greater, emphasis, to, infantry, and, cavalry, and, less, to, traditional, chariot, warfare, the, philosophically, pacifist, mohists, followers, of, the, philosopher, mozi, of, the, 5th, century, bc, believed, in, aiding, the, defensive, warfare, of, smaller, chinese, states, against, the, hostile, offensive, warfare, of, larger, domineering, states, the, mohists, were, renowned, in, the, smaller, states, and, the, enemies, of, the, larger, states, for, the, inventions, of, siege, machinery, to, scale, or, destroy, walls, these, included, traction, trebuchet, catapults, 8, foot, 2, 4, m, high, ballistas, a, wheeled, siege, ramp, with, grappling, hooks, known, as, the, cloud, bridge, the, protractible, folded, ramp, slinging, forward, by, means, of, a, counterweight, with, rope, and, pulley, and, wheeled, hook, carts, used, to, latch, large, iron, hooks, onto, the, tops, of, walls, to, pull, them, down, when, enemies, attempted, to, dig, tunnels, under, walls, for, mining, or, entry, into, the, city, the, defenders, used, large, bellows, the, type, the, chinese, commonly, used, in, heating, up, a, blast, furnace, for, smelting, cast, iron, to, pump, smoke, into, the, tunnels, in, order, to, suffocate, the, intruders, advances, in, the, prosecution, of, sieges, in, ancient, and, medieval, times, naturally, encouraged, the, development, of, a, variety, of, defensive, countermeasures, in, particular, medieval, fortifications, became, progressively, stronger, for, example, the, advent, of, the, concentric, castle, from, the, period, of, the, crusades, and, more, dangerous, to, attackers, witness, the, increasing, use, of, machicolations, and, murder, holes, as, well, the, preparation, of, hot, or, incendiary, substances, arrowslits, also, called, arrow, loops, or, loopholes, sally, ports, airlock, like, doors, for, sallies, and, deep, water, wells, were, also, integral, means, of, resisting, siege, at, this, time, particular, attention, would, be, paid, to, defending, entrances, with, gates, protected, by, drawbridges, portcullises, and, barbicans, moats, and, other, water, defenses, whether, natural, or, augmented, were, also, vital, to, defenders, in, the, european, middle, ages, virtually, all, large, cities, had, city, walls, dubrovnik, in, dalmatia, is, a, well, preserved, example, and, more, important, cities, had, citadels, forts, or, castles, great, effort, was, expended, to, ensure, a, good, water, supply, inside, the, city, in, case, of, siege, in, some, cases, long, tunnels, were, constructed, to, carry, water, into, the, city, complex, systems, of, tunnels, were, used, for, storage, and, communications, in, medieval, cities, like, t, bor, in, bohemia, similar, to, those, used, much, later, in, vietnam, during, the, vietnam, war, until, the, invention, of, gunpowder, based, weapons, and, the, resulting, higher, velocity, projectiles, the, balance, of, power, and, logistics, definitely, favored, the, defender, with, the, invention, of, gunpowder, cannon, and, mortars, and, howitzers, in, modern, times, the, traditional, methods, of, defense, became, less, effective, against, a, determined, siege, although, there, are, numerous, ancient, accounts, of, cities, being, sacked, few, contain, any, clues, to, how, this, was, achieved, some, popular, tales, existed, on, how, the, cunning, heroes, succeeded, in, their, sieges, the, best, known, is, the, trojan, horse, of, the, trojan, war, and, a, similar, story, tells, how, the, canaanite, city, of, joppa, was, conquered, by, the, egyptians, in, the, 15th, century, bc, the, biblical, book, of, joshua, contains, the, story, of, the, miraculous, battle, of, jericho, a, more, detailed, historical, account, from, the, 8th, century, bc, called, the, piankhi, stela, records, how, the, nubians, laid, siege, to, and, conquered, several, egyptian, cities, by, using, battering, rams, archers, and, slingers, and, building, causeways, across, moats, during, the, peloponnesian, war, one, hundred, sieges, were, attempted, and, fifty, eight, ended, with, the, surrender, of, the, besieged, area, alexander, the, great, s, army, successfully, besieged, many, powerful, cities, during, his, conquests, two, of, his, most, impressive, achievements, in, siegecraft, took, place, in, the, siege, of, tyre, and, the, siege, of, the, sogdian, rock, his, engineers, built, a, causeway, that, was, originally, 60, m, 200, ft, wide, and, reached, the, range, of, his, torsion, powered, artillery, while, his, soldiers, pushed, siege, towers, housing, stone, throwers, and, light, catapults, to, bombard, the, city, walls, most, conquerors, before, him, had, found, tyre, a, phoenician, island, city, about, 1, km, 1, 100, yd, from, the, mainland, impregnable, the, macedonians, built, a, mole, a, raised, spit, of, earth, across, the, water, by, piling, stones, up, on, a, natural, land, bridge, that, extended, underwater, to, the, island, and, although, the, tyrians, rallied, by, sending, a, fire, ship, to, destroy, the, towers, and, captured, the, mole, in, a, swarming, frenzy, the, city, eventually, fell, to, the, macedonians, after, a, seven, month, siege, in, complete, contrast, to, tyre, sogdian, rock, was, captured, by, stealthy, attack, alexander, used, commando, like, tactics, to, scale, the, cliffs, and, capture, the, high, ground, and, the, demoralized, defenders, surrendered, the, importance, of, siege, warfare, in, the, ancient, period, should, not, be, underestimated, one, of, the, contributing, causes, of, hannibal, s, inability, to, defeat, rome, was, his, lack, of, siege, engines, thus, while, he, was, able, to, defeat, roman, armies, in, the, field, he, was, unable, to, capture, rome, itself, the, legionary, armies, of, the, roman, republic, and, empire, are, noted, as, being, particularly, skilled, and, determined, in, siege, warfare, an, astonishing, number, and, variety, of, sieges, for, example, formed, the, core, of, julius, caesar, s, mid, 1st, century, bc, conquest, of, gaul, modern, france, in, his, commentarii, de, bello, gallico, commentaries, on, the, gallic, war, caesar, describes, how, at, the, battle, of, alesia, the, roman, legions, created, two, huge, fortified, walls, around, the, city, the, inner, circumvallation, 16, km, 10, mi, held, in, vercingetorix, s, forces, while, the, outer, contravallation, kept, relief, from, reaching, them, the, romans, held, the, ground, in, between, the, two, walls, the, besieged, gauls, facing, starvation, eventually, surrendered, after, their, relief, force, met, defeat, against, caesar, s, auxiliary, cavalry, the, sicarii, zealots, who, defended, masada, in, ad, 73, were, defeated, by, the, roman, legions, who, built, a, ramp, 100, metres, 330, ft, high, up, to, the, fortress, s, west, wall, during, the, roman, persian, wars, siege, warfare, was, extensively, being, used, by, both, sides, in, the, middle, ages, the, mongol, empire, s, campaign, against, china, then, comprising, the, western, xia, dynasty, jin, dynasty, and, southern, song, dynasty, by, genghis, khan, until, kublai, khan, who, eventually, established, the, yuan, dynasty, in, 1271, was, very, effective, allowing, the, mongols, to, sweep, through, large, areas, even, if, they, could, not, enter, some, of, the, more, well, fortified, cities, they, used, innovative, battle, tactics, to, grab, hold, of, the, land, and, the, people, by, concentrating, on, the, field, armies, the, strongholds, had, to, wait, of, course, smaller, fortresses, or, ones, easily, surprised, were, taken, as, they, came, along, this, had, two, effects, first, it, cut, off, the, principal, city, from, communicating, with, other, cities, where, they, might, expect, aid, secondly, refugees, from, these, smaller, cities, would, flee, to, the, last, stronghold, the, reports, from, these, cities, and, the, streaming, hordes, of, refugees, not, only, reduced, the, morale, of, the, inhabitants, and, garrison, of, the, principal, city, it, also, strained, their, resources, food, and, water, reserves, were, taxed, by, the, sudden, influx, of, refugees, soon, what, was, once, a, formidable, undertaking, became, easy, the, mongols, were, then, free, to, lay, siege, without, interference, of, the, field, army, as, it, had, been, destroyed, at, the, siege, of, aleppo, hulagu, used, twenty, catapults, against, the, bab, al, iraq, gate, of, iraq, alone, in, j, zj, n, there, are, several, episodes, in, which, the, mongols, constructed, hundreds, of, siege, machines, in, order, to, surpass, the, number, which, the, defending, city, possessed, while, j, zj, n, surely, exaggerated, the, improbably, high, numbers, which, he, used, for, both, the, mongols, and, the, defenders, do, give, one, a, sense, of, the, large, numbers, of, machines, used, at, a, single, siege, another, mongol, tactic, was, to, use, catapults, to, launch, corpses, of, plague, victims, into, besieged, cities, the, disease, carrying, fleas, from, the, bodies, would, then, infest, the, city, and, the, plague, would, spread, allowing, the, city, to, be, easily, captured, although, this, transmission, mechanism, was, not, known, at, the, time, in, 1346, the, bodies, of, mongol, warriors, of, the, golden, horde, who, had, died, of, plague, were, thrown, over, the, walls, of, the, crimean, city, of, kaffa, now, feodosiya, during, the, siege, of, caffa, it, has, been, speculated, that, this, operation, may, have, been, responsible, for, the, advent, of, the, black, death, in, europe, the, black, death, is, estimated, to, have, killed, 30, 60, of, europe, s, population, on, the, first, night, while, laying, siege, to, a, city, the, leader, of, the, mongol, forces, would, lead, from, a, white, tent, if, the, city, surrendered, all, would, be, spared, on, the, second, day, he, would, use, a, red, tent, if, the, city, surrendered, the, men, would, all, be, killed, but, the, rest, would, be, spared, on, the, third, day, he, would, use, a, black, tent, no, quarter, would, be, given, however, the, chinese, were, not, completely, defenseless, and, from, ad, 1234, until, 1279, the, southern, song, chinese, held, out, against, the, enormous, barrage, of, mongol, attacks, much, of, this, success, in, defense, lay, in, the, world, s, first, use, of, gunpowder, i, e, with, early, flamethrowers, grenades, firearms, cannons, and, land, mines, to, fight, back, against, the, khitans, the, tanguts, the, jurchens, and, then, the, mongols, the, chinese, of, the, song, period, also, discovered, the, explosive, potential, of, packing, hollowed, cannonball, shells, with, gunpowder, written, later, c, 1350, in, the, huo, long, jing, this, manuscript, of, jiao, yu, recorded, an, earlier, song, era, cast, iron, cannon, known, as, the, flying, cloud, thunderclap, eruptor, fei, yun, pi, li, pao, the, manuscript, stated, that, wade, giles, spelling, the, shells, phao, are, made, of, cast, iron, as, large, as, a, bowl, and, shaped, like, a, ball, inside, they, contain, half, a, pound, of, magic, gunpowder, shen, huo, they, are, sent, flying, towards, the, enemy, camp, from, an, eruptor, mu, phao, and, when, they, get, there, a, sound, like, a, thunder, clap, is, heard, and, flashes, of, light, appear, if, ten, of, these, shells, are, fired, successfully, into, the, enemy, camp, the, whole, place, will, be, set, ablaze, during, the, ming, dynasty, ad, 1368, 1644, the, chinese, were, very, concerned, with, city, planning, in, regards, to, gunpowder, warfare, the, site, for, constructing, the, walls, and, the, thickness, of, the, walls, in, beijing, s, forbidden, city, were, favoured, by, the, chinese, yongle, emperor, r, 1402, 1424, because, they, were, in, pristine, position, to, resist, cannon, volley, and, were, built, thick, enough, to, withstand, attacks, from, cannon, fire, for, more, see, technology, of, the, song, dynasty, the, introduction, of, gunpowder, and, the, use, of, cannons, brought, about, a, new, age, in, siege, warfare, cannons, were, first, used, in, song, dynasty, china, during, the, early, 13th, century, but, did, not, become, significant, weapons, for, another, 150, years, or, so, in, early, decades, cannons, could, do, little, against, strong, castles, and, fortresses, providing, little, more, than, smoke, and, fire, by, the, 16th, century, however, they, were, an, essential, and, regularized, part, of, any, campaigning, army, or, castle, s, defences, the, greatest, advantage, of, cannons, over, other, siege, weapons, was, the, ability, to, fire, a, heavier, projectile, farther, faster, and, more, often, than, previous, weapons, they, could, also, fire, projectiles, in, a, straight, line, so, that, they, could, destroy, the, bases, of, high, walls, thus, old, fashioned, walls, that, is, high, and, relatively, thin, were, excellent, targets, and, over, time, easily, demolished, in, 1453, the, theodosian, walls, of, constantinople, the, capital, of, the, roman, empire, were, broken, through, in, just, six, weeks, by, the, 62, cannons, of, mehmed, ii, s, army, although, in, the, end, the, conquest, was, a, long, and, extremely, difficult, siege, with, heavy, ottoman, casualties, due, to, the, repeated, attempts, at, taking, the, city, by, assault, however, new, fortifications, designed, to, withstand, gunpowder, weapons, were, soon, constructed, throughout, europe, during, the, renaissance, and, the, early, modern, period, siege, warfare, continued, to, dominate, the, conduct, of, the, european, wars, once, siege, guns, were, developed, the, techniques, for, assaulting, a, town, or, fortress, became, well, known, and, ritualized, the, attacking, army, would, surround, a, town, then, the, town, would, be, asked, to, surrender, if, they, did, not, comply, the, besieging, army, would, surround, the, town, with, temporary, fortifications, to, stop, sallies, from, the, stronghold, or, relief, getting, in, the, attackers, would, next, build, a, length, of, trenches, parallel, to, the, defenses, these, are, known, as, the, first, parallel, and, just, out, of, range, of, the, defending, artillery, they, would, dig, a, trench, known, as, a, forward, towards, the, town, in, a, zigzag, pattern, so, that, it, could, not, be, enfiladed, by, defending, fire, once, they, were, within, artillery, range, they, would, dig, another, parallel, the, second, parallel, trench, and, fortify, it, with, gun, emplacements, this, technique, is, commonly, called, entrenchment, if, necessary, using, the, first, artillery, fire, for, cover, the, forces, conducting, the, siege, would, repeat, the, process, until, they, placed, their, guns, close, enough, to, be, laid, aimed, accurately, to, make, a, breach, in, the, fortifications, in, order, to, allow, the, forlorn, hope, and, support, troops, to, get, close, enough, to, exploit, the, breach, more, zigzag, trenches, could, be, dug, even, closer, to, the, walls, with, more, parallel, trenches, to, protect, and, conceal, the, attacking, troops, after, each, step, in, the, process, the, besiegers, would, ask, the, besieged, to, surrender, if, the, forlorn, hope, stormed, the, breach, successfully, the, defenders, could, expect, no, mercy, the, castles, that, in, earlier, years, had, been, formidable, obstacles, were, easily, breached, by, the, new, weapons, for, example, in, spain, the, newly, equipped, army, of, ferdinand, and, isabella, was, able, to, conquer, moorish, strongholds, in, granada, in, 1482, 1492, that, had, held, out, for, centuries, before, the, invention, of, cannons, in, the, early, 15th, century, italian, architect, leon, battista, alberti, wrote, a, treatise, entitled, de, re, aedificatoria, which, theorized, methods, of, building, fortifications, capable, of, withstanding, the, new, guns, he, proposed, that, walls, be, built, in, uneven, lines, like, the, teeth, of, a, saw, he, proposed, star, shaped, fortresses, with, low, thick, walls, however, few, rulers, paid, any, attention, to, his, theories, a, few, towns, in, italy, began, building, in, the, new, style, late, in, the, 1480s, but, it, was, only, with, the, french, invasion, of, the, italian, peninsula, in, 1494, 1495, that, the, new, fortifications, were, built, on, a, large, scale, charles, viii, invaded, italy, with, an, army, of, 18, 000, men, and, a, horse, drawn, siege, train, as, a, result, he, could, defeat, virtually, any, city, or, state, no, matter, how, well, defended, in, a, panic, military, strategy, was, completely, rethought, throughout, the, italian, states, of, the, time, with, a, strong, emphasis, on, the, new, fortifications, that, could, withstand, a, modern, siege, the, most, effective, way, to, protect, walls, against, cannon, fire, proved, to, be, depth, increasing, the, width, of, the, defenses, and, angles, ensuring, that, attackers, could, only, fire, on, walls, at, an, oblique, angle, not, square, on, initially, walls, were, lowered, and, backed, in, front, and, behind, with, earth, towers, were, reformed, into, triangular, bastions, this, design, matured, into, the, trace, italienne, star, shaped, fortresses, surrounding, towns, and, even, cities, with, outlying, defenses, proved, very, difficult, to, capture, even, for, a, well, equipped, army, fortresses, built, in, this, style, throughout, the, 16th, century, did, not, become, fully, obsolete, until, the, 19th, century, and, were, still, in, use, throughout, world, war, i, though, modified, for, 20th, century, warfare, during, world, war, ii, trace, italienne, fortresses, could, still, present, a, formidable, challenge, for, example, in, the, last, days, of, world, war, ii, during, the, battle, in, berlin, that, saw, some, of, the, heaviest, urban, fighting, of, the, war, the, soviets, did, not, attempt, to, storm, the, spandau, citadel, built, between, 1559, and, 1594, but, chose, to, invest, it, and, negotiate, its, surrender, however, the, cost, of, building, such, vast, modern, fortifications, was, incredibly, high, and, was, often, too, much, for, individual, cities, to, undertake, many, were, bankrupted, in, the, process, of, building, them, others, such, as, siena, spent, so, much, money, on, fortifications, that, they, were, unable, to, maintain, their, armies, properly, and, so, lost, their, wars, anyway, nonetheless, innumerable, large, and, impressive, fortresses, were, built, throughout, northern, italy, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 16th, century, to, resist, repeated, french, invasions, that, became, known, as, the, italian, wars, many, stand, to, this, day, in, the, 1530s, and, 1540s, the, new, style, of, fortification, began, to, spread, out, of, italy, into, the, rest, of, europe, particularly, to, france, the, netherlands, and, spain, italian, engineers, were, in, enormous, demand, throughout, europe, especially, in, war, torn, areas, such, as, the, netherlands, which, became, dotted, by, towns, encircled, in, modern, fortifications, the, densely, populated, areas, of, northern, italy, and, the, united, provinces, the, netherlands, were, infamous, for, their, high, degree, of, fortification, of, cities, it, made, campaigns, in, these, areas, very, hard, to, successfully, conduct, considering, even, minor, cities, had, to, be, captured, by, siege, within, the, span, of, the, campaigning, season, in, the, dutch, case, the, possibility, of, flooding, large, parts, of, the, land, provided, an, additional, obstacle, to, besiegers, for, example, at, the, siege, of, leiden, for, many, years, defensive, and, offensive, tactics, were, well, balanced, leading, to, protracted, and, costly, wars, such, as, europe, had, never, known, involving, more, and, more, planning, and, government, involvement, the, new, fortresses, ensured, that, war, rarely, extended, beyond, a, series, of, sieges, because, the, new, fortresses, could, easily, hold, 10, 000, men, an, attacking, army, could, not, ignore, a, powerfully, fortified, position, without, serious, risk, of, counterattack, as, a, result, virtually, all, towns, had, to, be, taken, and, that, was, usually, a, long, drawn, out, affair, potentially, lasting, from, several, months, to, years, while, the, members, of, the, town, were, starved, to, death, most, battles, in, this, period, were, between, besieging, armies, and, relief, columns, sent, to, rescue, the, besieged, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, two, influential, military, engineers, the, french, marshal, vauban, and, the, dutch, military, engineer, menno, van, coehoorn, developed, modern, fortification, to, its, pinnacle, refining, siege, warfare, without, fundamentally, altering, it, ditches, would, be, dug, walls, would, be, protected, by, glacis, and, bastions, would, enfilade, an, attacker, both, engineers, developed, their, ideas, independently, but, came, to, similar, general, rules, regarding, defensive, construction, and, offensive, action, against, fortifications, both, were, skilled, in, conducting, sieges, and, defenses, themselves, before, vauban, and, van, coehoorn, sieges, had, been, somewhat, slapdash, operations, vauban, and, van, coehoorn, refined, besieging, to, a, science, with, a, methodical, process, that, if, uninterrupted, would, break, even, the, strongest, fortifications, examples, of, their, styles, of, fortifications, are, arras, vauban, and, the, no, longer, existent, fortress, of, bergen, op, zoom, van, coehoorn, the, main, differences, between, the, two, lay, in, the, difference, in, terrain, on, which, vauban, and, van, coehoorn, constructed, their, defenses, vauban, in, the, sometimes, more, hilly, and, mountainous, terrain, of, france, van, coehoorn, in, the, flat, and, floodable, lowlands, of, the, netherlands, planning, and, maintaining, a, siege, is, just, as, difficult, as, fending, one, off, a, besieging, army, must, be, prepared, to, repel, both, sorties, from, the, besieged, area, and, also, any, attack, that, may, try, to, relieve, the, defenders, it, was, thus, usual, to, construct, lines, of, trenches, and, defenses, facing, in, both, directions, the, outermost, lines, known, as, the, lines, of, contravallation, would, surround, the, entire, besieging, army, and, protect, it, from, attackers, this, would, be, the, first, construction, effort, of, a, besieging, army, built, soon, after, a, fortress, or, city, had, been, invested, a, line, of, circumvallation, would, also, be, constructed, facing, in, towards, the, besieged, area, to, protect, against, sorties, by, the, defenders, and, to, prevent, the, besieged, from, escaping, the, next, line, which, vauban, usually, placed, at, about, 600, metres, 2, 000, ft, from, the, target, would, contain, the, main, batteries, of, heavy, cannons, so, that, they, could, hit, the, target, without, being, vulnerable, themselves, once, this, line, was, established, work, crews, would, move, forward, creating, another, line, at, 250, metres, 1, 000, ft, this, line, contained, smaller, guns, the, final, line, would, be, constructed, only, 30, to, 60, metres, 100, to, 200, ft, from, the, fortress, this, line, would, contain, the, mortars, and, would, act, as, a, staging, area, for, attack, parties, once, the, walls, were, breached, van, coehoorn, developed, a, small, and, easily, movable, mortar, named, the, coehorn, variations, of, which, were, used, in, sieges, until, the, 19th, century, it, would, also, be, from, this, line, that, miners, working, to, undermine, the, fortress, would, operate, the, trenches, connecting, the, various, lines, of, the, besiegers, could, not, be, built, perpendicular, to, the, walls, of, the, fortress, as, the, defenders, would, have, a, clear, line, of, fire, along, the, whole, trench, thus, these, lines, known, as, saps, needed, to, be, sharply, jagged, another, element, of, a, fortress, was, the, citadel, usually, a, citadel, was, a, mini, fortress, within, the, larger, fortress, sometimes, designed, as, a, reduit, but, more, often, as, a, means, of, protecting, the, garrison, from, potential, revolt, in, the, city, the, citadel, was, used, in, wartime, and, peacetime, to, keep, the, residents, of, the, city, in, line, as, in, ages, past, most, sieges, were, decided, with, very, little, fighting, between, the, opposing, armies, an, attacker, s, army, was, poorly, served, incurring, the, high, casualties, that, a, direct, assault, on, a, fortress, would, entail, usually, they, would, wait, until, supplies, inside, the, fortifications, were, exhausted, or, disease, had, weakened, the, defenders, to, the, point, that, they, were, willing, to, surrender, at, the, same, time, diseases, especially, typhus, were, a, constant, danger, to, the, encamped, armies, outside, the, fortress, and, often, forced, a, premature, retreat, sieges, were, often, won, by, the, army, that, lasted, the, longest, an, important, element, of, strategy, for, the, besieging, army, was, whether, or, not, to, allow, the, encamped, city, to, surrender, usually, it, was, preferable, to, graciously, allow, a, surrender, both, to, save, on, casualties, and, to, set, an, example, for, future, defending, cities, a, city, that, was, allowed, to, surrender, with, minimal, loss, of, life, was, much, better, off, than, a, city, that, held, out, for, a, long, time, and, was, brutally, butchered, at, the, end, moreover, if, an, attacking, army, had, a, reputation, of, killing, and, pillaging, regardless, of, a, surrender, then, other, cities, defensive, efforts, would, be, redoubled, usually, a, city, would, surrender, with, no, honour, lost, when, its, inner, lines, of, defense, were, reached, by, the, attacker, in, case, of, refusal, however, the, inner, lines, would, have, to, be, stormed, by, the, attacker, and, the, attacking, troops, would, be, seen, to, be, justified, in, sacking, the, city, siege, warfare, dominated, in, western, europe, for, most, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, an, entire, campaign, or, longer, could, be, used, in, a, single, siege, for, example, ostend, in, 1601, 1604, la, rochelle, in, 1627, 1628, this, resulted, in, extremely, prolonged, conflicts, the, balance, was, that, while, siege, warfare, was, extremely, expensive, and, very, slow, it, was, very, successful, or, at, least, more, so, than, encounters, in, the, field, battles, arose, through, clashes, between, besiegers, and, relieving, armies, but, the, principle, was, a, slow, grinding, victory, by, the, greater, economic, power, the, relatively, rare, attempts, at, forcing, pitched, battles, gustavus, adolphus, in, 1630, the, french, against, the, dutch, in, 1672, or, 1688, were, almost, always, expensive, failures, the, exception, to, this, rule, were, the, english, during, the, english, civil, war, anything, which, tended, to, prolong, the, struggle, or, seemed, like, want, of, energy, and, avoidance, of, a, decision, was, bitterly, resented, by, the, men, of, both, sides, in, france, and, germany, the, prolongation, of, a, war, meant, continued, employment, for, the, soldiers, but, in, england, both, sides, were, looking, to, end, the, war, quickly, even, when, in, the, end, the, new, model, army, a, regular, professional, army, developed, the, original, decision, compelling, spirit, permeated, the, whole, organisation, as, was, seen, when, pitched, against, regular, professional, continental, troops, the, battle, of, the, dunes, during, the, interregnum, experienced, commanders, on, both, sides, in, the, english, civil, war, recommended, the, abandonment, of, garrisoned, fortifications, for, two, primary, reasons, the, first, as, for, example, proposed, by, the, royalist, sir, richard, willis, to, king, charles, was, that, by, abandoning, the, garrisoning, of, all, but, the, most, strategic, locations, in, one, s, own, territory, far, more, troops, would, be, available, for, the, field, armies, and, it, was, the, field, armies, which, would, decide, the, conflict, the, other, argument, was, that, by, slighting, potential, strong, points, in, one, s, own, territory, an, enemy, expeditionary, force, or, local, enemy, rising, would, find, it, more, difficult, to, consolidate, territorial, gains, against, an, inevitable, counterattack, sir, john, meldrum, put, forward, just, such, an, argument, to, the, parliamentary, committee, of, both, kingdoms, to, justify, his, slighting, of, gainsborough, in, lincolnshire, sixty, years, later, during, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, the, duke, of, marlborough, preferred, to, engage, the, enemy, in, pitched, battles, rather, than, engage, in, siege, warfare, although, he, was, very, proficient, in, both, types, of, warfare, on, 15, april, 1746, the, day, before, the, battle, of, culloden, at, dunrobin, castle, a, party, of, william, sutherland, s, militia, conducted, the, last, siege, fought, on, the, mainland, of, great, britain, against, jacobite, members, of, clan, macleod, in, the, french, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, wars, new, techniques, stressed, the, division, of, armies, into, all, arms, corps, that, would, march, separately, and, only, come, together, on, the, battlefield, the, less, concentrated, army, could, now, live, off, the, country, and, move, more, rapidly, over, a, larger, number, of, roads, fortresses, commanding, lines, of, communication, could, be, bypassed, and, would, no, longer, stop, an, invasion, since, armies, could, not, live, off, the, land, indefinitely, napoleon, bonaparte, always, sought, a, quick, end, to, any, conflict, by, pitched, battle, this, military, revolution, was, described, and, codified, by, clausewitz, advances, in, artillery, made, previously, impregnable, defenses, useless, for, example, the, walls, of, vienna, that, had, held, off, the, turks, in, the, mid, 17th, century, were, no, obstacle, to, napoleon, in, the, early, 19th, where, sieges, occurred, such, as, the, siege, of, delhi, and, the, siege, of, cawnpore, during, the, indian, rebellion, of, 1857, the, attackers, were, usually, able, to, defeat, the, defenses, within, a, matter, of, days, or, weeks, rather, than, weeks, or, months, as, previously, the, great, swedish, white, elephant, fortress, of, karlsborg, was, built, in, the, tradition, of, vauban, and, intended, as, a, reserve, capital, for, sweden, but, it, was, obsolete, before, it, was, completed, in, 1869, railways, when, they, were, introduced, made, possible, the, movement, and, supply, of, larger, armies, than, those, that, fought, in, the, napoleonic, wars, it, also, reintroduced, siege, warfare, as, armies, seeking, to, use, railway, lines, in, enemy, territory, were, forced, to, capture, fortresses, which, blocked, these, lines, during, the, franco, prussian, war, the, battlefield, front, lines, moved, rapidly, through, france, however, the, prussian, and, other, german, armies, were, delayed, for, months, at, the, siege, of, metz, and, the, siege, of, paris, due, to, the, greatly, increased, firepower, of, the, defending, infantry, and, the, principle, of, detached, or, semi, detached, forts, with, heavy, caliber, artillery, this, resulted, in, the, later, construction, of, fortress, works, across, europe, such, as, the, massive, fortifications, at, verdun, it, also, led, to, the, introduction, of, tactics, which, sought, to, induce, surrender, by, bombarding, the, civilian, population, within, a, fortress, rather, than, the, defending, works, themselves, the, siege, of, sevastopol, during, the, crimean, war, and, the, siege, of, petersburg, 1864, 1865, during, the, american, civil, war, showed, that, modern, citadels, when, improved, by, improvised, defences, could, still, resist, an, enemy, for, many, months, the, siege, of, plevna, during, the, russo, turkish, war, 1877, 1878, proved, that, hastily, constructed, field, defenses, could, resist, attacks, prepared, without, proper, resources, and, were, a, portent, of, the, trench, warfare, of, world, war, i, advances, in, firearms, technology, without, the, necessary, advances, in, battlefield, communications, gradually, led, to, the, defense, again, gaining, the, ascendancy, an, example, of, siege, during, this, time, prolonged, during, 337, days, due, to, the, isolation, of, the, surrounded, troops, was, the, siege, of, baler, in, which, a, reduced, group, of, spanish, soldiers, was, besieged, in, a, small, church, by, the, philippine, rebels, in, the, course, of, the, philippine, revolution, and, the, spanish, american, war, until, months, after, the, treaty, of, paris, the, end, of, the, conflict, furthermore, the, development, of, steamships, availed, greater, speed, to, blockade, runners, ships, with, the, purpose, of, bringing, cargo, e, g, food, to, cities, under, blockade, as, with, charleston, south, carolina, during, the, american, civil, war, mainly, as, a, result, of, the, increasing, firepower, such, as, machine, guns, available, to, defensive, forces, first, world, war, trench, warfare, briefly, revived, a, form, of, siege, warfare, although, siege, warfare, had, moved, out, from, an, urban, setting, because, city, walls, had, become, ineffective, against, modern, weapons, trench, warfare, was, nonetheless, able, to, use, many, of, the, techniques, of, siege, warfare, in, its, prosecution, sapping, mining, barrage, and, of, course, attrition, but, on, a, much, larger, scale, and, on, a, greatly, extended, front, more, traditional, sieges, of, fortifications, took, place, in, addition, to, trench, sieges, the, siege, of, tsingtao, was, one, of, the, first, major, sieges, of, the, war, but, the, inability, for, significant, resupply, of, the, german, garrison, made, it, a, relatively, one, sided, battle, the, germans, and, the, crew, of, an, austro, hungarian, protected, cruiser, put, up, a, hopeless, defense, and, after, holding, out, for, more, than, a, week, surrendered, to, the, japanese, forcing, the, german, east, asia, squadron, to, steam, towards, south, america, for, a, new, coal, source, the, other, major, siege, outside, europe, during, the, first, world, war, was, in, mesopotamia, at, the, siege, of, kut, after, a, failed, attempt, to, move, on, baghdad, stopped, by, the, ottomans, at, the, bloody, battle, of, ctesiphon, the, british, and, their, large, contingent, of, indian, sepoy, soldiers, were, forced, to, retreat, to, kut, where, the, ottomans, under, german, general, baron, colmar, von, der, goltz, laid, siege, the, british, attempts, to, resupply, the, force, via, the, tigris, river, failed, and, rationing, was, complicated, by, the, refusal, of, many, indian, troops, to, eat, cattle, products, by, the, time, the, garrison, fell, on, 29, april, 1916, starvation, was, rampant, conditions, did, not, improve, greatly, under, turkish, imprisonment, along, with, the, battles, of, tanga, sandfontein, gallipoli, and, namacurra, it, would, be, one, of, britain, s, numerous, embarrassing, colonial, defeats, of, the, war, the, largest, sieges, of, the, war, however, took, place, in, europe, the, initial, german, advance, into, belgium, produced, four, major, sieges, the, battle, of, li, ge, the, siege, of, namur, the, siege, of, maubeuge, and, the, siege, of, antwerp, all, four, would, prove, crushing, german, victories, at, li, ge, and, namur, against, the, belgians, at, maubeuge, against, the, french, and, at, antwerp, against, a, combined, anglo, belgian, force, the, weapon, that, made, these, victories, possible, were, the, german, big, berthas, and, the, skoda, 305, mm, model, 1911, siege, mortars, one, of, the, best, siege, mortars, of, the, war, on, loan, from, austria, hungary, these, huge, guns, were, the, decisive, weapon, of, siege, warfare, in, the, 20th, century, taking, part, at, przemy, l, the, belgian, sieges, on, the, italian, front, and, serbian, front, and, even, being, reused, in, world, war, ii, at, the, siege, of, przemy, l, the, austro, hungarian, garrison, showed, an, excellent, knowledge, of, siege, warfare, not, only, waiting, for, relief, but, sending, sorties, into, russian, lines, and, employing, an, active, defense, that, resulted, in, the, capture, of, the, russian, general, lavr, kornilov, despite, its, excellent, performance, the, garrison, s, food, supply, had, been, requisitioned, for, earlier, offensives, a, relief, expedition, was, stalled, by, the, weather, ethnic, rivalries, flared, up, between, the, defending, soldiers, and, a, breakout, attempt, failed, when, the, commander, of, the, garrison, hermann, kusmanek, finally, surrendered, his, troops, were, eating, their, horses, and, the, first, attempt, of, large, scale, air, supply, had, failed, it, was, one, of, the, few, great, victories, obtained, by, either, side, during, the, war, 110, 000, austro, hungarian, prisoners, were, marched, back, to, russia, use, of, aircraft, for, siege, running, bringing, supplies, to, areas, under, siege, would, nevertheless, prove, useful, in, many, sieges, to, come, the, largest, siege, of, the, war, and, arguably, the, roughest, most, gruesome, battle, in, history, was, the, battle, of, verdun, whether, the, battle, can, be, considered, true, siege, warfare, is, debatable, under, the, theories, of, erich, von, falkenhayn, it, is, more, distinguishable, as, purely, attrition, with, a, coincidental, presence, of, fortifications, on, the, battlefield, when, considering, the, plans, of, crown, prince, wilhelm, purely, concerned, with, taking, the, citadel, and, not, with, french, casualty, figures, it, can, be, considered, a, true, siege, the, main, fortifications, were, fort, douaumont, fort, vaux, and, the, fortified, city, of, verdun, itself, the, germans, through, the, use, of, huge, artillery, bombardments, flamethrowers, and, infiltration, tactics, were, able, to, capture, both, vaux, and, douaumont, but, were, never, able, to, take, the, city, and, eventually, lost, most, of, their, gains, it, was, a, battle, that, despite, the, french, ability, to, fend, off, the, germans, neither, side, won, the, german, losses, were, not, worth, the, potential, capture, of, the, city, and, the, french, casualties, were, not, worth, holding, the, symbol, of, her, defense, the, development, of, the, armored, tank, and, improved, infantry, tactics, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, swung, the, pendulum, back, in, favor, of, maneuver, and, with, the, advent, of, blitzkrieg, in, 1939, the, end, of, traditional, siege, warfare, was, at, hand, the, maginot, line, would, be, the, prime, example, of, the, failure, of, immobile, post, world, war, i, fortifications, although, sieges, would, continue, it, would, be, in, a, totally, different, style, and, on, a, reduced, scale, the, blitzkrieg, of, the, second, world, war, truly, showed, that, fixed, fortifications, are, easily, defeated, by, manoeuvre, instead, of, frontal, assault, or, long, sieges, the, great, maginot, line, was, bypassed, and, battles, that, would, have, taken, weeks, of, siege, could, now, be, avoided, with, the, careful, application, of, air, power, such, as, the, german, paratrooper, capture, of, fort, eben, emael, belgium, early, in, world, war, ii, the, most, important, siege, was, the, siege, of, leningrad, that, lasted, over, 29, months, about, half, of, the, duration, of, the, entire, second, world, war, the, siege, of, leningrad, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, some, one, million, of, the, city, s, inhabitants, along, with, the, battle, of, stalingrad, the, siege, of, leningrad, on, the, eastern, front, was, the, deadliest, siege, of, a, city, in, history, in, the, west, apart, from, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, the, sieges, were, not, on, the, same, scale, as, those, on, the, european, eastern, front, however, there, were, several, notable, or, critical, sieges, the, island, of, malta, for, which, the, population, won, the, george, cross, and, tobruk, in, the, south, east, asian, theatre, there, was, the, siege, of, singapore, and, in, the, burma, campaign, sieges, of, myitkyina, the, admin, box, imphal, and, kohima, which, was, the, high, water, mark, for, the, japanese, advance, into, india, the, siege, of, sevastopol, saw, the, use, of, the, heaviest, and, most, powerful, individual, siege, engines, ever, to, be, used, the, german, 800, mm, railway, gun, and, the, 600, mm, siege, mortar, though, a, single, shell, could, have, disastrous, local, effect, the, guns, were, susceptible, to, air, attack, in, addition, to, being, slow, to, move, throughout, the, war, both, the, western, allies, and, the, germans, tried, to, supply, forces, besieged, behind, enemy, lines, with, ad, hoc, airbridges, sometimes, these, attempts, failed, as, happened, to, the, besieged, german, sixth, army, the, battle, of, stalingrad, and, sometimes, they, succeeded, as, happened, during, the, battle, of, the, admin, box, 5, 23, february, 1944, and, during, the, short, siege, of, bastogne, december, 1944, the, logistics, of, strategic, airbridge, operations, were, developed, by, the, americans, flying, military, transport, aircraft, from, india, to, china, over, the, hump, 1942, 1945, to, resupply, the, chinese, war, effort, of, chiang, kai, shek, and, to, the, usaaf, xx, bomber, command, during, operation, matterhorn, tactical, airbridge, methods, were, developed, and, as, planned, used, extensively, for, supplying, the, chindits, during, operation, thursday, february, may, 1944, the, chindits, a, specially, trained, division, of, the, british, and, indian, armies, were, flown, deep, behind, japanese, front, lines, in, the, south, east, asian, theatre, to, jungle, clearings, in, burma, where, they, set, up, fortified, airheads, from, which, they, sailed, out, to, attack, japanese, lines, of, communications, while, defending, the, bases, from, japanese, counterattacks, the, bases, were, re, supplied, by, air, with, casualties, flown, out, by, returning, aircraft, when, the, japanese, attacked, in, strength, the, chindits, abandoned, the, bases, and, either, moved, to, new, bases, or, back, to, allied, lines, several, times, during, the, cold, war, the, western, powers, had, to, use, their, airbridge, expertise, in, both, vietnamese, cases, the, viet, minh, and, nlf, were, able, to, cut, off, the, opposing, army, by, capturing, the, surrounding, rugged, terrain, at, dien, bien, phu, the, french, were, unable, to, use, air, power, to, overcome, the, siege, and, were, defeated, however, at, khe, sanh, a, mere, 14, years, later, advances, in, air, power, and, a, reduction, in, vietnamese, anti, aircraft, capability, allowed, the, united, states, to, withstand, the, siege, the, resistance, of, us, forces, was, assisted, by, the, pavn, and, plaf, forces, decision, to, use, the, khe, sanh, siege, as, a, strategic, distraction, to, allow, their, mobile, warfare, offensive, the, first, tet, offensive, to, unfold, securely, the, battle, of, khe, sanh, displays, typical, features, of, modern, sieges, as, the, defender, has, greater, capacity, to, withstand, the, siege, the, attacker, s, main, aim, is, to, bottle, operational, forces, or, create, a, strategic, distraction, rather, than, take, the, siege, to, a, conclusion, in, neighboring, cambodia, at, that, time, known, as, the, khmer, republic, the, khmer, rouge, used, siege, tactics, to, cut, off, supplies, from, phnom, penh, to, other, government, held, enclaves, in, an, attempt, to, break, the, will, of, the, government, to, continue, fighting, in, 1972, during, the, easter, offensive, the, siege, of, an, l, c, vietnam, occurred, arvn, troops, and, u, s, advisers, and, air, power, successfully, defeated, communist, forces, the, battle, of, an, l, c, pitted, some, 6, 350, arvn, men, against, a, force, three, times, that, size, during, the, peak, of, the, battle, arvn, had, access, to, only, one, 105, mm, howitzer, to, provide, close, support, while, the, enemy, attack, was, backed, by, an, entire, artillery, division, arvn, had, no, tanks, the, nva, communist, forces, had, two, armoured, regiments, arvn, prevailed, after, over, two, months, of, continuous, fighting, as, general, paul, vanuxem, a, french, veteran, of, the, indochina, war, wrote, in, 1972, after, visiting, the, liberated, city, of, an, l, c, an, l, c, was, the, verdun, of, vietnam, where, vietnam, received, as, in, baptism, the, supreme, consecration, of, her, will, during, the, 1982, lebanon, war, the, israel, defence, forces, besieged, beirut, the, capital, of, lebanon, to, quickly, realize, their, goals, including, the, eviction, of, the, palestine, liberation, organization, from, the, country, during, the, yugoslav, wars, in, the, 1990s, republika, srpska, forces, besieged, sarajevo, the, capital, of, bosnia, herzegovina,

contexts, such, a, siege, is, typically, called, a, standoff, or, in, law, enforcement, jargon, a, barricade, situation, standoffs, may, result, from, crimes, and, incidents, such, as, robberies, raids, search, and, arrest, warrants, prison, riots, or, terrorist, attacks, standoffs, occur, due, to, a, variety, of, factors, most, prominently, the, safety, of, police, against, whom, the, besieged, may, have, the, upper, hand, the, besieged, suspects, who, police, generally, intend, to, arrest, bystanders, who, may, be, in, the, crossfire, and, hostages, who, may, be, injured, or, killed, by, the, suspects, the, optimal, result, of, most, standoffs, is, a, peaceful, resolution, the, safe, extraction, of, hostages, and, bystanders, and, the, peaceful, surrender, and, arrest, of, the, hostage, takers, to, ensure, this, police, make, use, of, trained, negotiators, and, psychologists, to, learn, the, hostage, takers, demands, and, meet, said, demands, if, feasible, or, permissible, gain, the, hostage, takers, trust, clarify, that, police, do, not, intend, to, kill, them, or, will, even, let, them, go, regardless, of, whether, such, claims, are, true, and, coax, the, hostage, takers, into, surrendering, or, at, least, releasing, hostages, in, the, event, a, peaceful, resolution, is, impossible, negotiations, fail, or, do, not, proceed, hostages, are, released, but, the, hostage, takers, refuse, to, surrender, the, hostage, takers, resist, violently, or, hostages, are, killed, police, may, respond, in, force, generally, being, able, to, rely, on, police, tactical, units, or, even, military, support, if, possible, and, required, most, standoffs, are, much, shorter, than, military, sieges, often, lasting, hours, or, days, at, most, lengthy, sieges, may, still, occur, albeit, rarely, such, as, the, 51, day, long, 1993, waco, siege, most, standoffs, end, in, a, peaceful, resolution, i, e, 1973, brooklyn, hostage, crisis, though, some, may, end, in, a,
