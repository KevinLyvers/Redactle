that, are, directly, descended, from, vulgar, latin, they, are, the, only, extant, subgroup, of, the, italic, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, the, five, most, widely, spoken, romance, languages, by, number, of, native, speakers, are, spanish, 489, million, official, in, spain, and, most, of, central, and, south, america, portuguese, 240, million, official, in, portugal, brazil, and, portuguese, speaking, africa, french, 80, million, italian, 67, million, official, in, italy, vatican, city, san, marino, and, switzerland, and, romanian, 30, million, official, in, romania, and, moldova, there, are, more, than, 900, million, native, speakers, of, romance, languages, found, worldwide, mainly, in, the, americas, europe, and, parts, of, africa, portuguese, french, and, spanish, also, have, many, non, native, speakers, and, are, in, widespread, use, as, linguae, francae, there, are, also, numerous, regional, romance, languages, and, dialects, the, term, romance, derives, from, the, vulgar, latin, adverb, romanice, in, roman, derived, from, romanicus, for, instance, in, the, expression, romanice, loqui, to, speak, in, roman, that, is, the, latin, vernacular, contrasted, with, latine, loqui, to, speak, in, latin, medieval, latin, the, conservative, version, of, the, language, used, in, writing, and, formal, contexts, or, as, a, lingua, franca, and, with, barbarice, loqui, to, speak, in, barbarian, the, non, latin, languages, of, the, peoples, living, outside, the, roman, empire, from, this, adverb, the, noun, romance, originated, which, applied, initially, to, anything, written, romanice, or, in, the, roman, vernacular, most, of, the, romance, speaking, area, in, europe, has, traditionally, been, a, dialect, continuum, where, the, speech, variety, of, a, location, differs, only, slightly, from, that, of, a, neighboring, location, but, over, a, longer, distance, these, differences, can, accumulate, to, the, point, where, two, remote, locations, speak, what, may, be, unambiguously, characterized, as, separate, languages, this, makes, drawing, language, boundaries, difficult, and, as, such, there, is, no, unambiguous, way, to, divide, the, romance, varieties, into, individual, languages, even, the, criterion, of, mutual, intelligibility, can, become, ambiguous, when, it, comes, to, determining, whether, two, language, varieties, belong, to, the, same, language, or, not, the, following, is, a, list, of, groupings, of, romance, languages, with, some, languages, chosen, to, exemplify, each, grouping, not, all, languages, are, listed, and, the, groupings, should, not, be, interpreted, as, well, separated, genetic, clades, in, a, tree, model, the, romance, language, most, widely, spoken, natively, today, is, spanish, followed, by, portuguese, french, italian, and, romanian, which, together, cover, a, vast, territory, in, europe, and, beyond, and, work, as, official, and, national, languages, in, dozens, of, countries, in, europe, at, least, one, romance, language, is, official, in, france, portugal, spain, italy, switzerland, belgium, romania, moldova, transnistria, monaco, andorra, san, marino, and, vatican, city, in, these, countries, french, portuguese, italian, spanish, romanian, moldovan, romansh, and, catalan, have, constitutional, official, status, french, italian, portuguese, spanish, and, romanian, are, also, official, languages, of, the, european, union, spanish, portuguese, french, italian, romanian, and, catalan, were, the, official, languages, of, the, defunct, latin, union, and, french, and, spanish, are, two, of, the, six, official, languages, of, the, united, nations, outside, europe, french, portuguese, and, spanish, are, spoken, and, enjoy, official, status, in, various, countries, that, emerged, from, the, respective, colonial, empires, with, almost, 500, million, speakers, worldwide, spanish, is, an, official, language, in, spain, and, in, nine, countries, of, south, america, home, to, about, half, that, continent, s, population, in, six, countries, of, central, america, all, except, belize, and, in, mexico, in, the, caribbean, it, is, official, in, cuba, the, dominican, republic, and, puerto, rico, in, all, these, countries, latin, american, spanish, is, the, vernacular, language, of, the, majority, of, the, population, giving, spanish, the, most, native, speakers, of, any, romance, language, in, africa, it, is, one, of, the, official, languages, of, equatorial, guinea, spanish, was, one, of, the, official, languages, in, the, philippines, in, southeast, asia, until, 1973, during, the, 1987, constitution, spanish, was, de, listed, as, an, official, language, replaced, with, english, and, was, listed, as, an, optional, voluntary, language, along, with, arabic, it, is, currently, spoken, by, a, minority, and, taught, in, the, school, curriculum, portuguese, in, its, original, homeland, portugal, is, spoken, by, virtually, the, entire, population, of, 10, million, as, the, official, language, of, brazil, it, is, spoken, by, more, than, 200, million, people, in, that, country, as, well, as, by, neighboring, residents, of, eastern, paraguay, and, northern, uruguay, accounting, for, a, little, more, than, half, the, population, of, south, america, thus, making, portuguese, the, most, spoken, official, romance, language, in, a, single, country, it, is, the, official, language, of, six, african, countries, angola, cape, verde, guinea, bissau, mozambique, equatorial, guinea, and, s, o, tom, and, pr, ncipe, and, is, spoken, as, a, native, language, by, perhaps, 16, million, residents, of, that, continent, in, asia, portuguese, is, co, official, with, other, languages, in, east, timor, and, macau, while, most, portuguese, speakers, in, asia, some, 400, 000, are, in, japan, due, to, return, immigration, of, japanese, brazilians, in, north, america, 1, 000, 000, people, speak, portuguese, as, their, home, language, mainly, immigrants, from, brazil, portugal, and, other, portuguese, speaking, countries, and, their, descendants, in, oceania, portuguese, is, the, second, most, spoken, romance, language, after, french, due, mainly, to, the, number, of, speakers, in, east, timor, its, closest, relative, galician, has, official, status, in, the, autonomous, community, of, galicia, in, spain, together, with, spanish, outside, europe, french, is, spoken, natively, most, in, the, canadian, province, of, quebec, and, in, parts, of, new, brunswick, and, ontario, canada, is, officially, bilingual, with, french, and, english, being, the, official, languages, and, government, services, in, french, theoretically, mandated, to, be, provided, nationwide, in, parts, of, the, caribbean, such, as, haiti, french, has, official, status, but, most, people, speak, creoles, such, as, haitian, creole, as, their, native, language, french, also, has, official, status, in, much, of, africa, with, relatively, few, native, speakers, but, larger, numbers, of, second, language, speakers, although, italy, also, had, some, colonial, possessions, before, world, war, ii, its, language, did, not, remain, official, after, the, end, of, the, colonial, domination, as, a, result, italian, outside, italy, and, switzerland, is, now, spoken, only, as, a, minority, language, by, immigrant, communities, in, north, and, south, america, and, australia, in, some, former, italian, colonies, in, africa, namely, libya, eritrea, and, somalia, it, is, spoken, by, a, few, educated, people, in, commerce, and, government, romania, did, not, establish, a, colonial, empire, the, native, range, of, romanian, includes, not, only, the, republic, of, moldova, where, it, is, the, dominant, language, and, spoken, by, a, majority, of, the, population, but, neighboring, areas, in, serbia, vojvodina, and, the, bor, district, bulgaria, hungary, and, ukraine, bukovina, budjak, and, in, some, villages, between, the, dniester, and, bug, rivers, as, with, italian, romanian, is, spoken, outside, of, its, ethnic, range, by, immigrant, communities, in, europe, romanian, speakers, form, about, two, percent, of, the, population, in, italy, spain, and, portugal, romanian, is, also, spoken, in, israel, by, romanian, jews, where, it, is, the, native, language, of, five, percent, of, the, population, and, is, spoken, by, many, more, as, a, secondary, language, the, aromanian, language, is, spoken, today, by, aromanians, in, bulgaria, north, macedonia, albania, kosovo, and, greece, the, total, of, 880, million, native, speakers, of, romance, languages, ca, 2020, are, divided, as, follows, catalan, is, the, official, language, of, andorra, in, spain, it, is, co, official, with, spanish, in, catalonia, the, valencian, community, under, the, name, valencian, and, the, balearic, islands, and, it, is, recognized, but, not, official, in, an, area, of, aragon, known, as, la, franja, in, addition, it, is, spoken, by, many, residents, of, alghero, on, the, island, of, sardinia, and, it, is, co, official, in, that, city, galician, with, more, than, three, million, speakers, is, official, together, with, spanish, in, galicia, and, has, legal, recognition, in, neighbouring, territories, in, castilla, y, le, n, a, few, other, languages, have, official, recognition, on, a, regional, or, otherwise, limited, level, for, instance, asturian, and, aragonese, in, spain, mirandese, in, portugal, friulian, sardinian, and, franco, proven, al, in, italy, and, romansh, in, switzerland, the, remaining, romance, languages, survive, mostly, as, spoken, languages, for, informal, contact, national, governments, have, historically, viewed, linguistic, diversity, as, an, economic, administrative, or, military, liability, as, well, as, a, potential, source, of, separatist, movements, therefore, they, have, generally, fought, to, eliminate, it, by, extensively, promoting, the, use, of, the, official, language, restricting, the, use, of, the, other, languages, in, the, media, recognizing, them, as, mere, dialects, or, even, persecuting, them, as, a, result, all, of, these, languages, are, considered, endangered, to, varying, degrees, according, to, the, unesco, red, book, of, endangered, languages, ranging, from, vulnerable, e, g, sicilian, and, venetian, to, severely, endangered, franco, proven, al, most, of, the, occitan, varieties, since, the, late, twentieth, and, early, twenty, first, centuries, increased, sensitivity, to, the, rights, of, minorities, has, allowed, some, of, these, languages, to, start, recovering, their, prestige, and, lost, rights, yet, it, is, unclear, whether, these, political, changes, will, be, enough, to, reverse, the, decline, of, minority, romance, languages, between, 350, bc, and, 150, ad, the, expansion, of, the, empire, together, with, its, administrative, and, educational, policies, made, latin, the, dominant, native, language, in, continental, western, europe, latin, also, exerted, a, strong, influence, in, southeastern, britain, the, roman, province, of, africa, western, germany, pannonia, and, the, whole, balkans, during, the, empire, s, decline, and, after, its, fragmentation, and, the, collapse, of, its, western, half, in, the, fifth, and, sixth, centuries, the, spoken, varieties, of, latin, became, more, isolated, from, each, other, with, the, western, dialects, coming, under, heavy, germanic, influence, the, goths, and, franks, in, particular, and, the, eastern, dialects, coming, under, slavic, influence, the, dialects, diverged, from, latin, at, an, accelerated, rate, and, eventually, evolved, into, a, continuum, of, recognizably, different, typologies, the, colonial, empires, established, by, portugal, spain, and, france, from, the, fifteenth, century, onward, spread, their, languages, to, the, other, continents, to, such, an, extent, that, about, two, thirds, of, all, romance, language, speakers, today, live, outside, europe, despite, other, influences, e, g, substratum, from, pre, roman, languages, especially, continental, celtic, languages, and, superstratum, from, later, germanic, or, slavic, invasions, the, phonology, morphology, and, lexicon, of, all, romance, languages, consist, mainly, of, evolved, forms, of, vulgar, latin, however, some, notable, differences, occur, between, today, s, romance, languages, and, their, roman, ancestor, with, only, one, or, two, exceptions, romance, languages, have, lost, the, declension, system, of, latin, and, as, a, result, have, svo, sentence, structure, and, make, extensive, use, of, prepositions, by, most, measures, sardinian, and, italian, are, the, least, divergent, languages, from, latin, while, french, has, changed, the, most, however, all, romance, languages, are, closer, to, each, other, than, to, classical, latin, documentary, evidence, about, vulgar, latin, for, the, purposes, of, comprehensive, research, is, limited, and, the, literature, is, often, hard, to, interpret, or, generalize, many, of, its, speakers, were, soldiers, slaves, displaced, peoples, and, forced, resettlers, and, more, likely, to, be, natives, of, conquered, lands, than, natives, of, rome, in, western, europe, latin, gradually, replaced, celtic, and, other, italic, languages, which, were, related, to, it, by, a, shared, indo, european, origin, commonalities, in, syntax, and, vocabulary, facilitated, the, adoption, of, latin, to, some, scholars, this, suggests, the, form, of, vulgar, latin, that, evolved, into, the, romance, languages, was, around, during, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, from, the, end, of, the, first, century, bc, and, was, spoken, alongside, the, written, classical, latin, which, was, reserved, for, official, and, formal, occasions, other, scholars, argue, that, the, distinctions, are, more, rightly, viewed, as, indicative, of, sociolinguistic, and, register, differences, normally, found, within, any, language, with, the, rise, of, the, roman, empire, spoken, latin, spread, first, throughout, italy, and, then, through, southern, western, central, and, southeastern, europe, and, northern, africa, along, parts, of, western, asia, 1, latin, reached, a, stage, when, innovations, became, generalised, around, the, sixth, and, seventh, centuries, after, that, time, and, within, two, hundred, years, it, became, a, dead, language, since, the, romanized, people, of, europe, could, no, longer, understand, texts, that, were, read, aloud, or, recited, to, them, by, the, eighth, and, ninth, centuries, latin, gave, way, to, romance, during, the, political, decline, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, the, fifth, century, there, were, large, scale, migrations, into, the, empire, and, the, latin, speaking, world, was, fragmented, into, several, independent, states, central, europe, and, the, balkans, were, occupied, by, germanic, and, slavic, tribes, as, well, as, by, huns, british, and, african, romance, the, forms, of, vulgar, latin, used, in, britain, and, the, roman, province, of, africa, where, it, had, been, spoken, by, much, of, the, urban, population, disappeared, in, the, middle, ages, as, did, moselle, romance, in, germany, but, the, germanic, tribes, that, had, penetrated, roman, italy, gaul, and, hispania, eventually, adopted, latin, romance, and, the, remnants, of, the, culture, of, ancient, rome, alongside, existing, inhabitants, of, those, regions, and, so, latin, remained, the, dominant, language, there, in, part, due, to, regional, dialects, of, the, latin, language, and, local, environments, several, languages, evolved, from, it, 4, meanwhile, large, scale, migrations, into, the, eastern, roman, empire, started, with, the, goths, and, continued, with, huns, avars, bulgars, slavs, pechenegs, hungarians, and, cumans, the, invasions, of, slavs, were, the, most, thoroughgoing, and, they, partially, reduced, the, romanic, element, in, the, balkans, the, invasion, of, the, turks, and, conquest, of, constantinople, in, 1453, marked, the, end, of, the, empire, the, surviving, local, romance, languages, were, dalmatian, and, common, romanian, over, the, course, of, the, fourth, to, eighth, centuries, local, changes, in, phonology, morphology, syntax, and, lexicon, accumulated, to, the, point, that, the, speech, of, any, locale, was, noticeably, different, from, another, in, principle, differences, between, any, two, lects, increased, the, more, they, were, separated, geographically, reducing, easy, mutual, intelligibility, between, speakers, of, distant, communities, clear, evidence, of, some, levels, of, change, is, found, in, the, reichenau, glosses, an, eighth, century, compilation, of, about, 1, 200, words, from, the, fourth, century, vulgate, of, jerome, that, had, changed, in, phonological, form, or, were, no, longer, normally, used, along, with, their, eighth, century, equivalents, in, proto, franco, proven, al, the, following, are, some, examples, with, reflexes, in, several, modern, romance, languages, for, comparison, in, all, of, the, above, examples, the, words, appearing, in, the, fourth, century, vulgate, are, the, same, words, as, would, have, been, used, in, classical, latin, of, c, 50, bc, it, is, likely, that, some, of, these, words, had, already, disappeared, from, casual, speech, by, the, time, of, the, glosses, but, if, so, they, may, well, have, been, still, widely, understood, as, there, is, no, recorded, evidence, that, the, common, people, of, the, time, had, difficulty, understanding, the, language, by, the, 8th, century, the, situation, was, very, different, during, the, late, 8th, century, charlemagne, holding, that, latin, of, his, age, was, by, classical, standards, intolerably, corrupt, 6, successfully, imposed, classical, latin, as, an, artificial, written, vernacular, for, western, europe, unfortunately, this, meant, that, parishioners, could, no, longer, understand, the, sermons, of, their, priests, forcing, the, council, of, tours, in, 813, to, issue, an, edict, that, priests, needed, to, translate, their, speeches, into, the, rustica, romana, lingua, an, explicit, acknowledgement, of, the, reality, of, the, romance, languages, as, separate, languages, from, latin, 6, by, this, time, and, possibly, as, early, as, the, 6th, century, according, to, price, 1984, 6, the, romance, lects, had, split, apart, enough, to, be, able, to, speak, of, separate, gallo, romance, ibero, romance, italo, romance, and, eastern, romance, languages, some, researchers, have, postulated, that, the, major, divergences, in, the, spoken, dialects, began, or, accelerated, considerably, in, the, 5th, century, as, the, formerly, widespread, and, efficient, communication, networks, of, the, western, roman, empire, rapidly, broke, down, leading, to, the, total, disappearance, of, the, western, roman, empire, by, the, end, of, the, century, during, the, period, between, the, 5th, 10th, centuries, ad, romance, vernaculars, documentation, is, scarce, as, the, normal, writing, language, used, was, medieval, latin, with, vernacular, writing, only, beginning, in, earnest, in, the, 11th, or, 12th, century, the, earliest, such, texts, are, the, indovinello, veronese, from, the, eight, century, and, the, oaths, of, strasbourg, from, the, second, half, of, the, ninth, century, from, the, 10th, century, onwards, some, local, vernaculars, developed, a, written, form, and, began, to, supplant, latin, in, many, of, its, roles, in, some, countries, such, as, portugal, this, transition, was, expedited, by, force, of, law, whereas, in, others, such, as, italy, many, prominent, poets, and, writers, used, the, vernacular, of, their, own, accord, some, of, the, most, famous, in, italy, being, giacomo, da, lentini, and, dante, alighieri, well, before, that, the, vernacular, was, also, used, for, practical, purposes, such, as, the, testimonies, in, the, placiti, cassinesi, written, 960, 963, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, brought, a, tendency, towards, greater, uniformity, of, standard, languages, within, political, boundaries, at, the, expense, of, other, romance, languages, and, dialects, less, favored, politically, in, france, for, instance, the, dialect, spoken, in, the, region, of, paris, gradually, spread, to, the, entire, country, and, the, occitan, of, the, south, lost, ground, lexical, and, grammatical, similarities, among, the, romance, languages, and, between, latin, and, each, of, them, are, apparent, from, the, following, examples, in, various, romance, lects, all, meaning, she, always, closes, the, window, before, she, dines, before, dining, some, of, the, divergence, comes, from, semantic, change, where, the, same, root, words, have, developed, different, meanings, for, example, the, portuguese, word, fresta, is, descended, from, latin, fenestra, window, and, is, thus, cognate, to, french, fen, tre, italian, finestra, romanian, fereastr, and, so, on, but, now, means, skylight, and, slit, cognates, may, exist, but, have, become, rare, such, as, hiniestra, in, spanish, or, dropped, out, of, use, entirely, the, spanish, and, portuguese, terms, defenestrar, meaning, to, throw, through, a, window, and, fenestrado, meaning, replete, with, windows, also, have, the, same, root, but, are, later, borrowings, from, latin, likewise, portuguese, also, has, the, word, cear, a, cognate, of, italian, cenare, and, spanish, cenar, but, uses, it, in, the, sense, of, to, have, a, late, supper, in, most, varieties, while, the, preferred, word, for, to, dine, is, jantar, related, to, archaic, spanish, yantar, to, eat, because, of, semantic, changes, in, the, 19th, century, galician, has, both, fiestra, from, medieval, f, estra, the, ancestor, of, standard, portuguese, fresta, and, the, less, frequently, used, vent, and, xanela, as, an, alternative, to, lei, originally, the, genitive, form, italian, has, the, pronoun, ella, a, cognate, of, the, other, words, for, she, but, it, is, hardly, ever, used, in, speaking, spanish, asturian, and, leonese, ventana, and, mirandese, and, sardinian, bentana, come, from, latin, ventus, wind, cf, english, window, etymologically, wind, eye, and, portuguese, janela, galician, xanela, mirandese, jinela, from, latin, ianuella, small, opening, a, derivative, of, ianua, door, sardinian, balcone, alternative, for, vent, na, bent, na, comes, from, old, italian, and, is, similar, to, other, romance, languages, such, as, french, balcon, from, italian, balcone, portuguese, balc, o, romanian, balcon, spanish, balc, n, catalan, balc, and, corsican, balconi, alternative, for, purtellu, along, with, latin, and, a, few, extinct, languages, of, ancient, italy, the, romance, languages, make, up, the, italic, branch, of, the, indo, european, family, identifying, subdivisions, of, the, romance, languages, is, inherently, problematic, because, most, of, the, linguistic, area, is, a, dialect, continuum, and, in, some, cases, political, biases, can, come, into, play, a, tree, model, is, often, used, but, the, selection, of, criteria, results, in, different, trees, most, classification, schemes, are, implicitly, or, not, historical, and, geographic, resulting, in, groupings, such, as, ibero, and, gallo, romance, a, major, division, can, be, drawn, between, eastern, and, western, romance, separated, by, the, la, spezia, rimini, line, the, main, subfamilies, that, have, been, proposed, by, ethnologue, within, the, various, classification, schemes, for, romance, languages, are, another, approach, involves, attempts, to, rank, the, distance, of, romance, languages, from, each, other, or, from, their, common, ancestor, i, e, ranking, languages, based, on, how, conservative, or, innovative, they, are, although, the, same, language, may, be, conservative, in, some, respects, while, innovative, in, others, by, most, measures, french, is, the, most, highly, differentiated, romance, language, although, romanian, has, changed, the, greatest, amount, of, its, vocabulary, while, italian, and, sardinian, have, changed, the, least, standard, italian, can, be, considered, a, central, language, which, is, generally, somewhat, easy, to, understand, to, speakers, of, other, romance, languages, whereas, french, and, romanian, are, peripheral, and, quite, dissimilar, from, the, rest, of, romance, some, romance, languages, have, developed, varieties, which, seem, dramatically, restructured, as, to, their, grammars, or, to, be, mixtures, with, other, languages, there, are, several, dozens, of, creoles, of, french, spanish, and, portuguese, origin, some, of, them, spoken, as, national, languages, and, lingua, franca, in, former, european, colonies, creoles, of, french, creoles, of, spanish, creoles, of, portuguese, latin, and, the, romance, languages, have, also, served, as, the, inspiration, and, basis, of, numerous, auxiliary, and, constructed, languages, so, called, neo, romance, languages, the, concept, was, first, developed, in, 1903, by, italian, mathematician, giuseppe, peano, under, the, title, latino, sine, flexione, he, wanted, to, create, a, naturalistic, international, language, as, opposed, to, an, autonomous, constructed, language, like, esperanto, or, volap, k, which, were, designed, for, maximal, simplicity, of, lexicon, and, derivation, of, words, peano, used, latin, as, the, base, of, his, language, because, as, he, described, it, latin, had, been, the, international, scientific, language, until, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, other, languages, developed, include, idiom, neutral, 1902, interlingue, occidental, 1922, interlingua, 1951, and, lingua, franca, nova, 1998, the, most, famous, and, successful, of, these, is, interlingua, each, of, these, languages, has, attempted, to, varying, degrees, to, achieve, a, pseudo, latin, vocabulary, as, common, as, possible, to, living, romance, languages, some, languages, have, been, constructed, specifically, for, communication, among, speakers, of, romance, languages, the, pan, romance, languages, there, are, also, languages, created, for, artistic, purposes, only, such, as, talossan, because, latin, is, a, very, well, attested, ancient, language, some, amateur, linguists, have, even,

wenedyk, mirrors, polish, rj, trunn, mirrors, icelandic, and, helvetian, mirrors, german, significant, sound, changes, affected, the, consonants, of, the, romance, languages, there, was, a, tendency, to, eliminate, final, consonants, in, vulgar, latin, either, by, dropping, them, apocope, or, adding, a, vowel, after, them, epenthesis, many, final, consonants, were, rare, occurring, only, in, certain, prepositions, e, g, ad, towards, apud, at, near, a, person, conjunctions, sed, but, demonstratives, e, g, illud, that, over, there, hoc, this, and, nominative, singular, noun, forms, especially, of, neuter, nouns, e, g, lac, milk, mel, honey, cor, heart, many, of, these, prepositions, and, conjunctions, were, replaced, by, others, while, the, nouns, were, regularized, into, forms, based, on, their, oblique, stems, that, avoided, the, final, consonants, e, g, lacte, mele, core, final, m, was, dropped, in, vulgar, latin, even, in, classical, latin, final, am, em, um, inflectional, suffixes, of, the, accusative, case, were, often, elided, in, poetic, meter, suggesting, the, m, was, weakly, pronounced, probably, marking, the, nasalisation, of, the, vowel, before, it, this, nasal, vowel, lost, its, nasalization, in, the, romance, languages, except, in, monosyllables, where, it, became, n, e, g, spanish, quien, quem, whom, french, rien, anything, rem, thing, note, especially, french, and, catalan, mon, meum, my, m, sg, which, are, derived, from, monosyllabic, meu, m, meu, n, mun, whereas, spanish, disyllabic, m, o, and, portuguese, and, catalan, monosyllabic, meu, are, derived, from, disyllabic, me, um, meo, as, a, result, only, the, following, final, consonants, occurred, in, vulgar, latin, final, t, was, eventually, lost, in, many, languages, although, this, often, occurred, several, centuries, after, the, vulgar, latin, period, for, example, the, reflex, of, t, was, dropped, in, old, french, and, old, spanish, only, around, 1100, in, old, french, this, occurred, only, when, a, vowel, still, preceded, the, t, generally, latin, a, hence, amat, he, loves, old, french, aime, but, venit, he, comes, old, french, vient, the, t, was, never, dropped, and, survives, into, modern, french, in, liaison, e, g, vient, il, is, he, coming, vj, ti, l, the, corresponding, t, in, aime, t, il, is, analogical, not, inherited, old, french, also, kept, the, third, person, plural, ending, nt, intact, in, italo, romance, and, the, eastern, romance, languages, eventually, all, final, consonants, were, either, lost, or, protected, by, an, epenthetic, vowel, except, for, some, articles, and, a, few, monosyllabic, prepositions, con, per, in, modern, standard, italian, still, has, very, few, consonant, final, words, although, romanian, has, resurfaced, them, through, later, loss, of, final, u, and, i, for, example, am, s, you, love, ame, italian, ami, amant, they, love, aman, ital, amano, on, the, evidence, of, sloppily, written, lombardic, language, documents, however, the, loss, of, final, s, in, northern, italy, did, not, occur, until, the, 7th, or, 8th, century, after, the, vulgar, latin, period, and, the, presence, of, many, former, final, consonants, is, betrayed, by, the, syntactic, gemination, raddoppiamento, sintattico, that, they, trigger, it, is, also, thought, that, after, a, long, vowel, s, became, j, rather, than, simply, disappearing, n, s, noi, we, cr, s, crai, tomorrow, southern, italy, in, unstressed, syllables, the, resulting, diphthongs, were, simplified, can, s, kanej, cani, dogs, am, c, s,

eventually, regained, a, large, number, of, final, consonants, through, the, general, loss, of, final, e, and, o, e, g, catalan, llet, milk, lactem, foc, fire, focum, peix, fish, piscem, in, french, most, of, these, secondary, final, consonants, as, well, as, primary, ones, were, lost, before, around, 1700, but, tertiary, final, consonants, later, arose, through, the, loss, of, a, hence,

describe, the, phonetic, evolution, of, velar, stops, preceding, a, front, vowel, and, of, consonant, clusters, involving, yod, or, of, the, palatal, approximant, itself, the, process, involving, gestural, blending, and, articulatory, reinforcement, starting, from, late, latin, and, early, romance, generated, a, new, series, of, consonants, in, romance, languages, stop, consonants, shifted, by, lenition, in, vulgar, latin, in, some, areas, the, voiced, labial, consonants, b, and, w, represented, by, b, and, v, respectively, both, developed, a, fricative, as, an, intervocalic, allophone, this, is, clear, from, the, orthography, in, medieval, times, the, spelling, of, a, consonantal, v, is, often, used, for, what, had, been, a, b, in, classical, latin, or, the, two, spellings, were, used, interchangeably, in, many, romance, languages, italian, french, portuguese, romanian, etc, this, fricative, later, developed, into, a, v, but, in, others, spanish, galician, some, catalan, and, occitan, dialects, etc, reflexes, of, b, and, w, simply, merged, into, a, single, phoneme, several, other, consonants, were, softened, in, intervocalic, position, in, western, romance, spanish, portuguese, french, northern, italian, but, normally, not, phonemically, in, the, rest, of, italy, except, some, cases, of, elegant, or, ecclesiastical, words, nor, apparently, at, all, in, romanian, the, dividing, line, between, the, two, sets, of, dialects, is, called, the, la, spezia, rimini, line, and, is, one, of, the, most, important, isogloss, bundles, of, the, romance, dialects, the, changes, instances, of, diachronic, lenition, resulting, in, phonological, restructuring, are, as, follows, single, voiceless, plosives, became, voiced, p, t, c, b, d, g, subsequently, in, some, languages, they, were, further, weakened, either, becoming, fricatives, or, approximants, as, in, spanish, or, disappearing, entirely, such, as, t, and, k, lost, between, vowels, in, french, but, p, v, the, following, example, shows, progressive, weakening, of, original, t, e, g, v, tam, italian, vita, portuguese, vida, european, portuguese, spanish, vida, southern, peninsular, spanish, and, french, vie, some, scholars, have, speculated, that, these, sound, changes, may, be, due, in, part, to, the, influence, of, continental, celtic, languages, while, scholarship, of, the, past, few, decades, has, proposed, internal, motivations, the, sound, h, was, lost, but, later, reintroduced, into, individual, romance, languages, the, so, called, h, aspir, aspirated, h, in, french, now, completely, silent, was, a, borrowing, from, frankish, in, spanish, word, initial, f, changed, to, h, during, its, medieval, stage, and, was, lost, afterwards, for, example, farina, harina, romanian, acquired, it, most, likely, from, the, adstrate, consonant, length, is, no, longer, phonemically, distinctive, in, most, romance, languages, however, some, languages, of, italy, italian, sardinian, sicilian, and, numerous, other, varieties, of, central, and, southern, italy, do, have, long, consonants, like, bb, dd, pp, tt, kk, ll, mm, nn, rr, ss, etc, where, the, doubling, indicates, either, actual, length, or, in, the, case, of, plosives, and, affricates, a, short, hold, before, the, consonant, is, released, in, many, cases, with, distinctive, lexical, value, e, g, note, n, te, notes,

words, in, romanesco, neapolitan, sicilian, and, other, southern, varieties, and, are, occasionally, indicated, in, writing, e, g, sicilian, cchi, more, and, cc, here, in, general, the, consonants, b, ts, and, dz, are, long, at, the, start, of, a, word, while, the, archiphoneme, r, is, realised, as, a, trill, r, in, the, same, position, in, much, of, central, and, southern, italy, the, affricates, t, and, d, weaken, synchronically, to, fricative, and, between, vowels, while, their, geminate, congeners, do, not, e, g, cacio, kat, o, cheese, vs, caccio, katt, o, i, chase, in, italian, the, geminates, and, are, pronounced, as, long, and, between, vowels, but, normally, reduced, to, short, following, pause, lasciare, let, leave, or, la, sciarpa, the, scarf, with, but, post, pausal, sciarpa, with, a, few, languages, have, regained, secondary, geminate, consonants, the, double, consonants, of, piedmontese, exist, only, after, stressed, written, and, are, not, etymological, v, dde,

usually, pronounced, as, a, simple, sound, in, colloquial, and, even, some, formal, speech, in, both, languages, in, late, latin, a, prosthetic, vowel, i, lowered, to, e, in, most, languages, was, inserted, at, the, beginning, of, any, word, that, began, with, s, referred, to, as, s, impura, and, a, voiceless, consonant, sc, isc, while, western, romance, words, fused, the, prosthetic, vowel,

in, italian, syllabification, rules, were, preserved, instead, by, vowel, final, articles, thus, feminine, spada, as, la, spada, but, instead, of, rendering, the, masculine, il, stato, lo, stato, came, to, be, the, norm, though, receding, at, present, italian, once, had, a, prosthetic, i, maintaining, s, syllable, final, if, a, consonant, preceded, such, clusters, so, that, in, switzerland, was, in, svizzera, some, speakers, still, use, the, prothetic, productively, and, it, is, fossilized, in, a, few, set, locutions, such, as, in, ispecie, especially, or, per, iscritto, in, writing, a, form, whose, survival, may, have, been, buttressed, in, part, by, the, word, iscritto, latin, nscr, ptus, one, profound, change, that, affected, vulgar, latin, was, the, reorganisation, of, its, vowel, system, classical, latin, had, five, short, vowels, and, five, long, vowels, each, of, which, was, an, individual, phoneme, see, the, table, in, the, right, for, their, likely, pronunciation, in, ipa, and, four, diphthongs, ae, oe, au, and, eu, five, according, to, some, authors, including, ui, there, were, also, long, and, short, versions, of, y, representing, the, rounded, vowel, y, in, greek, borrowings, which, however, probably, came, to, be, pronounced, i, even, before, romance, vowel, changes, started, there, is, evidence, that, in, the, imperial, period, all, the, short, vowels, except, a, differed, by, quality, as, well, as, by, length, from, their, long, counterparts, so, for, example, was, pronounced, close, mid, e, while, was, pronounced, open, mid, and, was, pronounced, close, i, while, was, pronounced, near, close, during, the, proto, romance, period, phonemic, length, distinctions, were, lost, vowels, came, to, be, automatically, pronounced, long, in, stressed, open, syllables, i, e, when, followed, by, only, one, consonant, and, pronounced, short, everywhere, else, this, situation, is, still, maintained, in, modern, italian, cade, he, falls, vs, cadde, he, fell, the, proto, romance, loss, of, phonemic, length, originally, produced, a, system, with, nine, different, quality, distinctions, in, monophthongs, where, only, original, a, a, had, merged, soon, however, many, of, these, vowels, coalesced, further, variants, are, found, in, southern, italy, and, corsica, which, also, boasts, a, completely, distinct, system, the, sardinian, type, vowel, system, is, also, found, in, a, small, region, belonging, to, the, lausberg, area, also, known, as, lausberg, zone, compare, neapolitan, language, distribution, of, southern, italy, in, southern, basilicata, and, there, is, evidence, that, the, romanian, type, compromise, vowel, system, was, once, characteristic, of, most, of, southern, italy, although, it, is, now, limited, to, a, small, area, in, western, basilicata, centered, on, the, castelmezzano, dialect, the, area, being, known, as, vorposten, the, german, word, for, outpost, the, sicilian, vowel, system, now, generally, thought, to, be, a, development, based, on, the, italo, western, system, is, also, represented, in, southern, italy, in, southern, cilento, calabria, and, the, southern, tip, of, apulia, and, may, have, been, more, widespread, in, the, past, the, greatest, variety, of, vowel, systems, outside, of, southern, italy, is, found, in, corsica, where, the, italo, western, type, is, represented, in, most, of, the, north, and, center, and, the, sardinian, type, in, the, south, as, well, as, a, system, resembling, the, sicilian, vowel, system, and, even, more, closely, the, carovignese, system, in, the, cap, corse, region, finally, in, between, the, italo, western, and, sardinian, system, is, found, in, the, taravo, region, a, unique, vowel, system, that, cannot, be, derived, from, any, other, system, which, has, reflexes, like, sardinian, for, the, most, part, but, the, short, high, vowels, of, latin, are, uniquely, reflected, as, mid, low, vowels, the, proto, romance, allophonic, vowel, length, system, was, phonemicized, in, the, gallo, romance, languages, as, a, result, of, the, loss, of, many, final, vowels, some, northern, italian, languages, e, g, friulian, still, maintain, this, secondary, phonemic, length, but, most, languages, dropped, it, by, either, diphthongizing, or, shortening, the, new, long, vowels, french, phonemicized, a, third, vowel, length, system, around, ad, 1300, as, a, result, of, the, sound, change, vsc, vhc, v, c, where, v, is, any, vowel, and, c, any, consonant, this, vowel, length, began, to, be, lost, in, early, modern, french, but, the, long, vowels, are, still, usually, marked, with, a, circumflex, and, continue, to, be, distinguished, regionally, chiefly, in, belgium, a, fourth, vowel, length, system, still, non, phonemic, has, now, arisen, all, nasal, vowels, as, well, as, the, oral, vowels, o, which, mostly, derive, from, former, long, vowels, are, pronounced, long, in, all, stressed, closed, syllables, and, all, vowels, are, pronounced, long, in, syllables, closed, by, the, voiced, fricatives, v, z, v, this, system, in, turn, has, been, phonemicized, in, some, varieties, e, g, haitian, creole, as, a, result, of, the, loss, of, final, the, latin, diphthongs, ae, and, oe, pronounced, aj, and, oj, in, earlier, latin, were, early, on, monophthongized, ae, became, by, the, 1st, century, a, d, at, the, latest, although, this, sound, was, still, distinct, from, all, existing, vowels, the, neutralization, of, latin, vowel, length, eventually, caused, its, merger, with, short, e, e, g, caelum, sky, french, ciel, spanish, italian, cielo, portuguese, c, u, s, w, with, the, same, vowel, as, in, mele, honey, french, spanish, miel, italian, miele, portuguese, mel, m, l, some, words, show, an, early, merger, of, ae, with, e, as, in, praeda, booty, pr, da, pre, da, french, proie, vs, expected, pri, e, italian, preda, not, prieda, prey, or, faenum, hay, f, num, spanish, heno, french, foin, but, italian, fieno, fj, no, oe, generally, merged, with, e, poenam, punishment, romance, pena, spanish, italian, pena, french, peine, foedus, ugly, romance, fedo, spanish, feo, portuguese, feio, there, are, relatively, few, such, outcomes, since, oe, was, rare, in, classical, latin, most, original, instances, had, become, classical, as, in, old, latin, oinos, one, classical, nus, and, so, oe, was, mostly, limited, to, greek, loanwords, which, were, typically, learned, high, register, terms, au, merged, with, o, in, the, popular, speech, of, rome, already, by, the, 1st, century, b, c, a, number, of, authors, remarked, on, this, explicitly, e, g, cicero, s, taunt, that, the, populist, politician, publius, clodius, pulcher, had, changed, his, name, from, claudius, to, ingratiate, himself, with, the, masses, this, change, never, penetrated, far, from, rome, however, and, the, pronunciation, au, was, maintained, for, centuries, in, the, vast, majority, of, latin, speaking, areas, although, it, eventually, developed, into, some, variety, of, o, in, many, languages, for, example, italian, and, french, have, as, the, usual, reflex, but, this, post, dates, diphthongization, of, and, the, french, specific, palatalization, ka, t, a, hence, causa, french, chose, italian, cosa, k, za, not, cuosa, spanish, has, o, but, portuguese, spelling, maintains, ou, which, has, developed, to, o, and, still, remains, as, ou, in, some, dialects, and, oi, in, others, occitan, dalmatian, sardinian, and, many, other, minority, romance, languages, still, have, au, while, in, romanian, it, underwent, diaresis, like, in, aurum, aur, a, ur, a, few, common, words, however, show, an, early, merger, with, o, evidently, reflecting, a, generalization, of, the, popular, roman, pronunciation, e, g, french, queue, italian, coda, koda, occitan, co, d, a, romanian, coad, all, meaning, tail, must, all, derive, from, c, da, rather, than, classical, cauda, similarly, spanish, oreja, portuguese, orelha, french, oreille, romanian, ureche, and, sardinian, ol, cra, or, cla, ear, must, derive, from, ric, u, la, rather, than, classical, auris, occitan, aurelha, was, probably, influenced, by, the, unrelated, ausir, aud, re, to, hear, and, the, form, oricla, is, in, fact, reflected, in, the, appendix, probi, an, early, process, that, operated, in, all, romance, languages, to, varying, degrees, was, metaphony, vowel, mutation, conceptually, similar, to, the, umlaut, process, so, characteristic, of, the, germanic, languages, depending, on, the, language, certain, stressed, vowels, were, raised, or, sometimes, diphthongized, either, by, a, final, i, or, u, or, by, a, directly, following, j, metaphony, is, most, extensive, in, the, italo, romance, languages, and, applies, to, nearly, all, languages, in, italy, however, it, is, absent, from, tuscan, and, hence, from, standard, italian, in, many, languages, affected, by, metaphony, a, distinction, exists, between, final, u, from, most, cases, of, latin, um, and, final, o, from, latin, ud, and, some, cases, of, um, esp, masculine, mass, nouns, and, only, the, former, triggers, metaphony, some, examples, a, number, of, languages, diphthongized, some, of, the, free, vowels, especially, the, open, mid, vowels, these, diphthongization, had, the, effect, of, reducing, or, eliminating, the, distinctions, between, open, mid, and, close, mid, vowels, in, many, languages, in, spanish, and, romanian, all, open, mid, vowels, were, diphthongized, and, the, distinction, disappeared, entirely, portuguese, is, the, most, conservative, in, this, respect, keeping, the, seven, vowel, system, more, or, less, unchanged, but, with, changes, in, particular, circumstances, e, g, due, to, metaphony, other, than, before, palatalized, consonants, catalan, keeps, o, intact, but, e, split, in, a, complex, fashion, into, e, and, then, coalesced, again, in, the, standard, dialect, eastern, catalan, in, such, a, way, that, most, original, e, have, reversed, their, quality, to, become, e, in, french, and, italian, the, distinction, between, open, mid, and, close, mid, vowels, occurred, only, in, closed, syllables, standard, italian, more, or, less, maintains, this, in, french, e, and, merged, by, the, twelfth, century, or, so, and, the, distinction, between, and, o, was, eliminated, without, merging, by, the, sound, changes, u, y, o, u, generally, this, led, to, a, situation, where, both, and, occur, allophonically, with, the, close, mid, vowels, in, open, syllables, and, the, open, mid, vowels, in, closed, syllables, in, french, both, and, were, partly, rephonemicized, both, e, and, occur, in, open, syllables, as, a, result, of, aj, and, both, o, and, occur, in, closed, syllables, as, a, result, of, al, au, o, old, french, also, had, numerous, falling, diphthongs, resulting, from, diphthongization, before, palatal, consonants, or, from, a, fronted, j, originally, following, palatal, consonants, in, proto, romance, or,

the, more, difficult, issues, is, the, development, of, final, short, u, which, appears, to, have, been, raised, to, u, rather, than, lowered, to, o, as, happened, in, all, other, syllables, however, it, is, possible, that, in, reality, final, u, comes, from, long, um, where, original, final, m, caused, vowel, lengthening, as, well, as, nasalization, evidence, of, this, comes, from, rhaeto, romance, in, particular, sursilvan, which, preserves, reflexes, of, both, final, us, and, um, and, where, the, latter, but, not, the, former, triggers, metaphony, this, suggests, the, development, us, s, os, but, um, u, the, original, five, vowel, system, in, final, unstressed, syllables, was, preserved, as, is, in, some, of, the, more, conservative, central, italian, languages, but, in, most, languages, there, was, further, coalescence, various, later, changes, happened, in, individual, languages, e, g, the, so, called, intertonic, vowels, are, word, internal, unstressed, vowels, i, e, not, in, the, initial, final, or, tonic, i, e, stressed, syllable, hence, intertonic, intertonic, vowels, were, the, most, subject, to, loss, or, modification, already, in, vulgar, latin, intertonic, vowels, between, a, single, consonant, and, a, following, r, or, l, tended, to, drop, v, tulum, old, veclum, dalmatian, vieklo, sicilian, vecchiu, portuguese, velho, but, many, languages, ultimately, dropped, almost, all, intertonic, vowels, generally, those, languages, south, and, east, of, the, la, spezia, rimini, line, romanian, and, central, southern, italian, maintained, intertonic, vowels, while, those, to, the, north, and, west, western, romance, dropped, all, except, a, standard, italian, generally, maintained, intertonic, vowels, but, typically, raised, unstressed, e, i, examples, portuguese, is, more, conservative, in, maintaining, some, intertonic, vowels, other, than, a, e, g, offer, scere, to, offer, portuguese, oferecer, vs, spanish, ofrecer, french, offrir, offer, re, french, on, the, other, hand, drops, even, intertonic, a, after, the, stress, st, phanum, stephen, spanish, esteban, but, old, french, estievne, french, tienne, many, cases, of, a, before, the, stress, also, ultimately, dropped, in, french, sacram, ntum, sacrament, old, french, sairement, french, serment, oath, the, romance, languages, for, the, most, part, have, continued, to, use, the, latin, alphabet, while, adapting, it, to, their, evolution, one, exception, was, romanian, where, before, the, nineteenth, century, the, romanian, cyrillic, alphabet, was, used, due, to, slavic, influence, after, the, roman, retreat, a, cyrillic, alphabet, was, also, used, for, romanian, then, called, moldovan, in, the, ussr, the, non, christian, populations, of, spain, also, used, the, scripts, of, their, religions, arabic, and, hebrew, to, write, romance, languages, such, as, judaeo, spanish, and, mozarabic, in, aljamiado, the, classical, latin, alphabet, of, 23, letters, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, v, x, y, z, was, modified, and, augmented, in, various, ways, to, yield, the, spelling, systems, of, the, romance, languages, in, particular, the, single, latin, letter, v, split, into, v, consonant, and, u, vowel, and, the, letter, i, split, into, i, and, j, the, latin, letter, k, and, the, new, letter, w, which, came, to, be, widely, used, in, germanic, languages, are, seldom, used, in, most, romance, languages, mostly, for, unassimilated, foreign, names, and, words, indeed, in, italian, prose, kilometro, is, properly, chilometro, portuguese, and, catalan, eschew, importation, of, foreign, letters, more, than, most, languages, thus, wikipedia, is, viquip, dia, in, catalan, but, wikipedia, in, spanish, chikungunya, sandwich, kiwi, are, chicungunha, sandu, che, quiu, in, portuguese, but, chikungu, a, s, ndwich, kiwi, in, spanish, while, most, of, the, 23, basic, latin, letters, have, maintained, their, phonetic, value, for, some, of, them, it, has, diverged, considerably, and, the, new, letters, added, since, the, middle, ages, have, been, put, to, different, uses, in, different, scripts, some, letters, notably, h, and, q, have, been, variously, combined, in, digraphs, or, trigraphs, see, below, to, represent, phonetic, phenomena, that, could, not, be, recorded, with, the, basic, latin, alphabet, or, to, get, around, previously, established, spelling, conventions, most, languages, added, auxiliary, marks, diacritics, to, some, letters, for, these, and, other, purposes, the, spelling, systems, of, most, romance, languages, are, fairly, simple, and, consistent, within, any, language, spelling, rules, are, typically, phonemic, as, opposed, to, being, strictly, phonetic, as, a, result, of, this, the, actual, pronunciation, of, standard, written, forms, can, vary, substantially, according, to, the, speaker, s, accent, which, may, differ, by, region, or, the, position, of, a, sound, in, the, word, or, utterance, allophony, the, following, letters, have, notably, different, values, between, languages, or, between, latin, and, the, romance, languages, otherwise, letters, that, are, not, combined, as, digraphs, generally, represent, the, same, phonemes, as, suggested, by, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, whose, design, was, in, fact, greatly, influenced, by, romance, spelling, systems, since, most, romance, languages, have, more, sounds, than, can, be, accommodated, in, the, roman, latin, alphabet, they, all, resort, to, the, use, of, digraphs, and, trigraphs, combinations, of, two, or, three, letters, with, a, single, phonemic, value, the, concept, but, not, the, actual, combinations, is, derived, from, classical, latin, which, used, for, example, th, ph, and, ch, when, transliterating, the, greek, letters, later, and, these, were, once, aspirated, sounds, in, greek, before, changing, to, corresponding, fricatives, and, the, h, represented, what, sounded, to, the, romans, like, an, following, t, p, and, k, respectively, some, of, the, digraphs, used, in, modern, scripts, are, while, the, digraphs, ch, ph, rh, and, th, were, at, one, time, used, in, many, words, of, greek, origin, most, languages, have, now, replaced, them, with, c, qu, f, r, and, t, only, french, has, kept, these, etymological, spellings, which, now, represent, k, or, f, and, t, respectively, gemination, in, the, languages, where, it, occurs, is, usually, indicated, by, doubling, the, consonant, except, when, it, does, not, contrast, phonemically, with, the, corresponding, short, consonant, in, which, case, gemination, is, not, indicated, in, j, rriais, long, consonants, are, marked, with, an, apostrophe, s, s, is, a, long, zz, ss, s, is, a, long, ss, and, t, t, is, a, long, tt, the, phonemic, contrast, between, geminate, and, single, consonants, is, widespread, in, italian, and, normally, indicated, in, the, traditional, orthography, fatto, fatto, done, vs, fato, fato, fate, destiny, cadde, kadde, s, he, it, fell, vs, cade, kade, s, he, it, falls, the, double, consonants, in, french, orthography, however, are, merely, etymological, in, catalan, the, gemination, of, l, is, marked, by, a, punt, volat, flying, point, l, l, romance, languages, also, introduced, various, marks, diacritics, that, may, be, attached, to, some, letters, for, various, purposes, in, some, cases, diacritics, are, used, as, an, alternative, to, digraphs, and, trigraphs, namely, to, represent, a, larger, number, of, sounds, than, would, be, possible, with, the, basic, alphabet, or, to, distinguish, between, sounds, that, were, previously, written, the, same, diacritics, are, also, used, to, mark, word, stress, to, indicate, exceptional, pronunciation, of, letters, in, certain, words, and, to, distinguish, words, with, same, pronunciation, homophones, depending, on, the, language, some, letter, diacritic, combinations, may, be, considered, distinct, letters, e, g, for, the, purposes, of, lexical, sorting, this, is, the, case, for, example, of, romanian, and, spanish, the, following, are, the, most, common, use, of, diacritics, in, romance, languages, most, languages, are, written, with, a, mixture, of, two, distinct, but, phonetically, identical, variants, or, cases, of, the, alphabet, majuscule, uppercase, or, capital, letters, derived, from, roman, stone, carved, letter, shapes, and, minuscule, lowercase, derived, from, carolingian, writing, and, medieval, quill, pen, handwriting, which, were, later, adapted, by, printers, in, the, fifteenth, and, sixteenth, centuries, in, particular, all, romance, languages, capitalize, use, uppercase, for, the, first, letter, of, the, following, words, the, first, word, of, each, complete, sentence, most, words, in, names, of, people, places, and, organizations, and, most, words, in, titles, of, books, the, romance, languages, do, not, follow, the, german, practice, of, capitalizing, all, nouns, including, common, ones, unlike, english, the, names, of, months, days, of, the, weeks, and, derivatives, of, proper, nouns, are, usually, not, capitalized, thus, in, italian, one, capitalizes, francia, france, and, francesco, francis, but, not, francese, french, or, francescano, franciscan, however, each, language, has, some, exceptions, to, this, general, rule, the, tables, below, provide, a, vocabulary, comparison, that, illustrates, a, number, of, examples, of, sound, shifts, that, have, occurred, between, latin, and, romance, languages, words, are, given, in, their, conventional, spellings, in, addition, for, french, the, actual, pronunciation, is, given, due, to, the, dramatic, differences, between, spelling, and, pronunciation, french, spelling, approximately, reflects, the,
