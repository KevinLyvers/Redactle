the, term, social, order, can, be, used, in, two, senses, in, the, first, sense, it, refers, to, a, particular, system, of, social, structures, and, institutions, examples, are, the, ancient, the, feudal, and, the, capitalist, social, order, in, the, second, sense, social, order, is, contrasted, to, social, chaos, or, disorder, and, refers, to, a, stable, state, of, society, in, which, the, existing, social, structure, is, accepted, and, maintained, by, its, members, the, problem, of, order, or, hobbesian, problem, which, is, central, to, much, of, sociology, political, science, and, political, philosophy, is, the, question, of, how, and, why, it, is, that, social, orders, exist, at, all, thomas, hobbes, is, recognized, as, the, first, to, clearly, formulate, the, problem, to, answer, which, he, conceived, the, notion, of, a, social, contract, social, theorists, such, as, karl, marx, mile, durkheim, talcott, parsons, and, j, rgen, habermas, have, proposed, different, explanations, for, what, a, social, order, consists, of, and, what, its, real, basis, is, for, marx, it, is, the, relations, of, production, or, economic, structure, which, is, the, basis, of, social, order, for, durkheim, it, is, a, set, of, shared, social, norms, for, parsons, it, is, a, set, of, social, institutions, regulating, the, pattern, of, action, orientation, which, again, are, based, on, a, frame, of, cultural, values, for, habermas, it, is, all, of, these, as, well, as, communicative, action, another, key, factor, concerning, social, order, is, the, principle, of, extensiveness, this, states, the, more, norms, and, the, more, important, the, norms, are, to, a, society, the, better, these, norms, tie, and, hold, together, the, group, as, a, whole, a, good, example, of, this, is, smaller, religions, based, in, the, u, s, such, as, the, amish, many, amish, live, together, in, communities, and, because, they, share, the, same, religion, and, values, it, is, easier, for, them, to, succeed, in, upholding, their, religion, and, views, because, their, way, of, life, is, the, norm, for, their, community, in, every, society, people, belong, to, groups, such, as, businesses, families, churches, athletic, groups, or, neighborhoods, the, structure, inside, of, these, groups, mirrors, that, of, the, whole, society, there, are, networks, and, ties, between, groups, as, well, as, inside, of, each, of, the, groups, which, create, social, order, status, groups, can, be, based, on, a, person, s, characteristics, such, as, race, ethnicity, sexual, orientation, religion, caste, region, occupation, physical, attractiveness, gender, education, age, etc, they, are, defined, as, a, subculture, having, a, rather, specific, rank, or, status, within, the, stratification, system, that, is, societies, tend, to, include, a, hierarchy, of, status, groups, some, enjoying, high, ranking, and, some, low, one, example, of, this, hierarchy, is, the, prestige, of, a, university, professor, compared, to, that, of, a, garbage, man, a, certain, lifestyle, usually, distinguishes, the, members, of, different, status, groups, for, example, around, the, holidays, a, jewish, family, may, celebrate, hanukkah, while, a, christian, family, may, celebrate, christmas, other, cultural, differences, such, as, language, and, cultural, rituals, identify, members, of, different, status, groups, smaller, groups, exist, inside, of, one, status, group, for, instance, one, can, belong, to, a, status, group, based, on, one, s, race, and, a, social, class, based, on, financial, ranking, this, may, cause, strife, for, the, individual, in, this, situation, when, they, feel, they, must, choose, to, side, with, either, their, status, group, or, their, social, class, for, example, a, wealthy, african, american, man, who, feels, he, has, to, take, a, side, on, an, issue, on, which, the, opinions, of, poor, african, americans, and, wealthy, white, americans, are, divided, and, finds, his, class, and, status, group, opposed, values, can, be, defined, as, internal, criteria, for, evaluation, values, are, also, split, into, two, categories, there, are, individual, values, which, pertains, to, something, that, we, think, has, worth, and, then, there, are, social, values, social, values, are, our, desires, modified, according, to, ethical, principles, or, according, to, the, group, we, associate, with, friends, family, or, co, workers, norms, tell, us, what, people, ought, to, do, in, a, given, situation, unlike, values, norms, are, enforced, externally, or, outside, of, oneself, a, society, as, a, whole, determines, norms, and, they, can, be, passed, down, from, generation, to, generation, an, exception, to, the, idea, of, values, and, norms, as, social, order, keepers, is, deviant, behavior, not, everyone, in, a, society, abides, by, a, set, of, personal, values, or, the, group, s, norms, all, the, time, for, this, reason, it, is, generally, deemed, necessary, for, a, society, to, have, authority, the, adverse, opinion, holds, that, the, need, for, authority, stems, from, social, inequality, in, a, class, society, those, who, hold, positions, of, power, and, authority, are, among, the, upper, class, norms, differ, for, each, class, because, the, members, of, each, class, were, raised, differently, and, hold, different, sets, of, values, tension, can, form, therefore, between, the, upper, class, and, lower, class, when, laws, and, rules, are, put, in, place, that, do, not, conform, to, the, values, of, both, classes, the, order, does, not, necessarily, need, to, be, controlled, by, the, government, individuals, pursuing, self, interest, can, make, predictable, systems, these, systems, being, planned, by, more, than, one, person, may, actually, be, preferable, to, those, planned, by, a, single, person, this, means, that, predictability, may, be, possible, to, achieve, without, a, central, government, s, control, these, stable, expectations, do, not, necessarily, lead, to, individuals, behaving, in, ways, that, are, considered, beneficial, to, group, welfare, considering, this, thomas, schelling, studied, neighborhood, racial, segregation, his, findings, suggest, that, interaction, can, produce, predictability, but, it, does, not, always, increase, social, order, in, his, researching, he, found, that, when, all, individuals, pursue, their, own, preferences, the, outcome, is, segregation, rather, than, integration, as, stated, in, theories, of, social, order, edited, by, michael, hechter, and, christine, horne, social, honor, can, also, be, referred, to, as, social, status, it, is, considered, the, distribution, of, prestige, or, the, approval, respect, admiration, or, deference, a, person, or, group, is, able, to, command, by, virtue, of, his, or, its, imputed, qualities, or, performances, the, case, most, often, is, that, people, associate, social, honor, with, the, place, a, person, occupies, with, material, systems, of, wealth, and, power, since, most, of, the, society, finds, wealth, and, power, desirable, they, respect, or, envy, people, that, have, more, than, they, do, when, social, honor, is, referred, to, as, social, status, it, deals, with, the, rank, of, a, person, within, the, stratification, system, status, can, be, achieved, which, is, when, a, person, position, is, gained, on, the, basis, of, merit, or, in, other, words, by, achievement, and, hard, work, or, it, can, be, ascribed, which, is, when, a, person, position, is, assigned, to, individuals, or, groups, without, regard, for, merit, but, because, of, certain, traits, beyond, their, control, such, as, race, sex, or, parental, social, standing, an, example, of, ascribed, status, is, kate, middleton, who, married, a, prince, an, example, of, achieved, status, is, oprah, winfrey, an, african, american, woman, from, poverty, who, worked, her, way, to, being, a, billionaire, two, different, theories, exist, that, explain, and, attempt, to, account, for, social, order, the, first, theory, is, order, results, from, a, large, number, of, independent, decisions, to, transfer, individual, rights, and, liberties, to, a, coercive, state, in, return, for, its, guarantee, of, security, for, persons, and, their, property, as, well, as, its, establishment, of, mechanisms, to, resolve, disputes, as, stated, in, theories, of, social, order, by, hechter, and, horne, the, next, theory, is, that, the, ultimate, source, of, social, order, as, residing, not, in, external, controls, but, in, a, concordance, of, specific, values, and, norms, that, individuals, somehow, have, managed, to, internalize, also, stated, in, theories, of, social, order, by, hechter, and, horne, both, arguments, for, how, social, order, is, attained, are, very, different, one, argues, that, it, is, achieved, through, outside, influence, and, control, and, the, other, argues, that, it, can, only, be, attained, when, the, individual, willingly, follows, norms, and, values, that, they, have, grown, accustomed, to, and, internalized, weber, s, insistence, on, the, importance, of, domination, and, symbolic, systems, in, social, life, was, retained, by, pierre, bourdieu, who, developed, the, idea, of, social, orders, ultimately, transforming, it, into, a, theory, of, fields
