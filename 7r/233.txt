branch, of, the, semitic, language, includes, arabic, aramaic, canaanite, phoenician, hebrew, and, others, the, origins, of, proto, semitic, may, lie, in, the, arabian, peninsula, with, the, language, spreading, from, there, to, other, regions, this, theory, proposes, that, semitic, peoples, reached, mesopotamia, and, other, areas, from, the, deserts, to, the, west, such, as, the, akkadians, who, entered, mesopotamia, around, the, late, 4th, millennium, bce, the, origins, of, semitic, peoples, are, thought, to, include, various, regions, mesopotamia, the, levant, the, arabian, peninsula, and,

country, the, practice, of, marrying, of, relatives, is, a, common, feature, of, arab, culture, in, the, arab, world, today, between, 40, and, 50, of, all, marriages, are, consanguineous, or, between, close, family, members, though, these, figures, may, vary, among, arab, nations, in, egypt, around, 40, of, the, population, marry, a, cousin, a, 1992, survey, in, jordan, found, that, 32, were, married, to, a, first, cousin, a, further, 17, 3, were, married, to, more, distant, relatives, 67, of, marriages, in, saudi, arabia, are, between, close, relatives, as, are, 54, of, all, marriages,

allowed, in, islam, and, the, quran, itself, does, not, discourage, or, forbid, the, practice, nevertheless, opinions, vary, on, whether, the, phenomenon, should, be, seen, as, exclusively, based, on, islamic, practices, as, a, 1992, study, among, arabs, in, jordan, did, not, show, significant, differences, between, christian, arabs, or, muslim, arabs, when, comparing, the, occurrence, of, consanguinity, arabs, are, genetically, diverse, arising, from, admixture, with, indigenous, peoples, of, pre, islamic, middle, east, and, north, africa, following, the, islamic, expansion, genetic, ancestry, components, related, to, the, arabian, peninsula, display, an, increasing, frequency, pattern, from, west, to, east, over, north, africa, a, similar, frequency, pattern, exist, across, northeastern, africa, with, decreasing, genetic, affinities, to, groups, of, the, arabian, peninsula, along, the, nile, river, valley, across, sudan, and, south, sudan, the, more, they, go, south, this, genetic, cline, of, admixture, is, dated, to, the, time, of, arab, expansion, and, immigration, to, the, maghreb, and, northeast, africa, genetic, research, has, indicated, that, palestinian, arabs, and, jews, share, common, genetic, ancestry, and, are, closely, related, according, to, a, 2016, study, indigenous, arabs, from, the, arabian, peninsula, are, direct, descendants, of, the, first, eurasian, populations, established, by, out, of, africa, migrations, they, are, also, very, distant, from, contemporary, eurasians, although, there, is, signal, of, european, admixture, the, fame, of, edessa, in, history, rests, however, mainly, on, its, claim, to, have, been, the, first, kingdom, to, adopt, christianity, as, its, official, religion, according, to, the, legend, current, for, centuries, throughout, the, civilized, world, abgar, ukkama, wrote, to, jesus, inviting, him, to, visit, him, at, edessa, to, heal, him, from, sickness, in, return, he, received, the, blessing, of, jesus, and, subsequently, was, converted, by, the, evangelist, addai, there, is, however, no, factual, evidence, for, christianity, at, edessa, before, the, reign, of, abgar, the, great, 150, years, later, scholars, are, generally, agreed, that, the, legend, has, confused, the, two, abgars, it, cannot, be, proved, that, abgar, the, great, adopted, christianity, but, his, friend, bardai, an, was, a, heterodox, christian, and, there, was, a, church, at, edessa, in, 201, it, is, testimony, to, the, personality, of, abgar, the, great, that, he, is, credited, by, tradition, with, a, leading, role, in, the, evangelization, of, edessa
