https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proverb
a, proverb, from, latin, proverbium, or, an, adage, is, a, simple, traditional, saying, that, expresses, a, perceived, truth, based, on, common, sense, or, experience, proverbs, are, often, metaphorical, and, are, an, example, of, formulaic, language, a, proverbial, phrase, or, a, proverbial, expression, is, a, type, of, a, conventional, saying, similar, to, proverbs, and, transmitted, by, oral, tradition, the, difference, is, that, a, proverb, is, a, fixed, expression, while, a, proverbial, phrase, permits, alterations, to, fit, the, grammar, of, the, context, collectively, they, form, a, genre, of, folklore, some, proverbs, exist, in, more, than, one, language, because, people, borrow, them, from, languages, and, cultures, with, which, they, are, in, contact, in, the, west, the, bible, including, but, not, limited, to, the, book, of, proverbs, and, medieval, latin, aided, by, the, work, of, erasmus, have, played, a, considerable, role, in, distributing, proverbs, not, all, biblical, proverbs, however, were, distributed, to, the, same, extent, one, scholar, has, gathered, evidence, to, show, that, cultures, in, which, the, bible, is, the, major, spiritual, book, contain, between, three, hundred, and, five, hundred, proverbs, that, stem, from, the, bible, whereas, another, shows, that, of, the, 106, most, common, and, widespread, proverbs, across, europe, 11, are, from, the, bible, however, almost, every, culture, has, its, own, unique, proverbs, lord, john, russell, c, 1850, observed, poetically, that, a, proverb, is, the, wit, of, one, and, the, wisdom, of, many, but, giving, the, word, proverb, the, sort, of, definition, theorists, need, has, proven, to, be, a, difficult, task, and, although, scholars, often, quote, archer, taylor, s, argument, that, formulating, a, scientific, definition, of, a, proverb, is, too, difficult, to, repay, the, undertaking, an, incommunicable, quality, tells, us, this, sentence, is, proverbial, and, that, one, is, not, hence, no, definition, will, enable, us, to, identify, positively, a, sentence, as, proverbial, many, students, of, proverbs, have, attempted, to, itemize, their, essential, characteristics, more, constructively, mieder, has, proposed, the, following, definition, a, proverb, is, a, short, generally, known, sentence, of, the, folk, which, contains, wisdom, truth, morals, and, traditional, views, in, a, metaphorical, fixed, and, memorizable, form, and, which, is, handed, down, from, generation, to, generation, to, distinguish, proverbs, from, idioms, cliches, etc, norrick, created, a, table, of, distinctive, features, an, abstract, tool, originally, developed, for, linguistics, prahlad, distinguishes, proverbs, from, some, other, closely, related, types, of, sayings, true, proverbs, must, further, be, distinguished, from, other, types, of, proverbial, speech, e, g, proverbial, phrases, wellerisms, maxims, quotations, and, proverbial, comparisons, based, on, persian, proverbs, zolfaghari, and, ameri, propose, the, following, definition, a, proverb, is, a, short, sentence, which, is, well, known, and, at, times, rhythmic, including, advice, sage, themes, and, ethnic, experiences, comprising, simile, metaphor, or, irony, which, is, well, known, among, people, for, its, fluent, wording, clarity, of, expression, simplicity, expansiveness, and, generality, and, is, used, either, with, or, without, change, there, are, many, sayings, in, english, that, are, commonly, referred, to, as, proverbs, such, as, weather, sayings, alan, dundes, however, rejects, including, such, sayings, among, truly, proverbs, are, weather, proverbs, proverbs, i, would, say, emphatically, no, the, definition, of, proverb, has, also, changed, over, the, years, for, example, the, following, was, labeled, a, yorkshire, proverb, in, 1883, but, would, not, be, categorized, as, a, proverb, by, most, today, as, throng, as, throp, s, wife, when, she, hanged, herself, with, a, dish, cloth, the, changing, of, the, definition, of, proverb, is, also, noted, in, turkish, in, other, languages, and, cultures, the, definition, of, proverb, also, differs, from, english, in, the, chumburung, language, of, ghana, a, ase, are, literal, proverbs, and, akpare, are, metaphoric, ones, among, the, bini, of, nigeria, there, are, three, words, that, are, used, to, translate, proverb, ere, ivbe, and, itan, the, first, relates, to, historical, events, the, second, relates, to, current, events, and, the, third, was, linguistic, ornamentation, in, formal, discourse, among, the, balochi, of, pakistan, and, afghanistan, there, is, a, word, batal, for, ordinary, proverbs, and, bass, ttuks, for, proverbs, with, background, stories, there, are, also, language, communities, that, combine, proverbs, and, riddles, in, some, sayings, leading, some, scholars, to, create, the, label, proverb, riddles, another, similar, construction, is, an, idiomatic, phrase, sometimes, it, is, difficult, to, draw, a, distinction, between, idiomatic, phrase, and, proverbial, expression, in, both, of, them, the, meaning, does, not, immediately, follow, from, the, phrase, the, difference, is, that, an, idiomatic, phrase, involves, figurative, language, in, its, components, while, in, a, proverbial, phrase, the, figurative, meaning, is, the, extension, of, its, literal, meaning, some, experts, classify, proverbs, and, proverbial, phrases, as, types, of, idioms, proverbs, come, from, a, variety, of, sources, some, are, indeed, the, result, of, people, pondering, and, crafting, language, such, as, some, by, confucius, plato, baltasar, graci, n, etc, others, are, taken, from, such, diverse, sources, as, poetry, stories, songs, commercials, advertisements, movies, literature, etc, a, number, of, the, well, known, sayings, of, jesus, shakespeare, and, others, have, become, proverbs, though, they, were, original, at, the, time, of, their, creation, and, many, of, these, sayings, were, not, seen, as, proverbs, when, they, were, first, coined, many, proverbs, are, based, on, stories, often, the, end, of, a, story, for, example, the, proverb, who, will, bell, the, cat, is, from, the, end, of, a, story, about, the, mice, planning, how, to, be, safe, from, the, cat, some, authors, have, created, proverbs, in, their, writings, such, as, j, r, r, tolkien, and, some, of, these, proverbs, have, made, their, way, into, broader, society, similarly, c, s, lewis, is, credited, for, a, proverb, regarding, a, lobster, in, a, pot, which, he, wrote, about, in, his, book, series, chronicles, of, narnia, in, cases, like, this, deliberately, created, proverbs, for, fictional, societies, have, become, proverbs, in, real, societies, in, a, fictional, story, set, in, a, real, society, the, movie, forrest, gump, introduced, life, is, like, a, box, of, chocolates, into, broad, society, in, at, least, one, case, it, appears, that, a, proverb, deliberately, created, by, one, writer, has, been, naively, picked, up, and, used, by, another, who, assumed, it, to, be, an, established, chinese, proverb, ford, madox, ford, having, picked, up, a, proverb, from, ernest, bramah, it, would, be, hypocrisy, to, seek, for, the, person, of, the, sacred, emperor, in, a, low, tea, house, the, proverb, with, a, longer, history, than, any, other, recorded, proverb, in, the, world, going, back, to, around, 1800, bc, is, in, a, sumerian, clay, tablet, the, bitch, by, her, acting, too, hastily, brought, forth, the, blind, though, many, proverbs, are, ancient, they, were, all, newly, created, at, some, point, by, somebody, sometimes, it, is, easy, to, detect, that, a, proverb, is, newly, coined, by, a, reference, to, something, recent, such, as, the, haitian, proverb, the, fish, that, is, being, microwaved, doesn, t, fear, the, lightning, similarly, there, is, a, recent, maltese, proverb, wil, muturi, ferh, u, duluri, women, and, motorcycles, are, joys, and, griefs, the, proverb, is, clearly, new, but, still, formed, as, a, traditional, style, couplet, with, rhyme, also, there, is, a, proverb, in, the, kafa, language, of, ethiopia, that, refers, to, the, forced, military, conscription, of, the, 1980s, the, one, who, hid, himself, lived, to, have, children, a, mongolian, proverb, also, shows, evidence, of, recent, origin, a, beggar, who, sits, on, gold, foam, rubber, piled, on, edge, another, example, of, a, proverb, that, is, clearly, recent, is, this, from, sesotho, a, mistake, goes, with, the, printer, a, political, candidate, in, kenya, popularised, a, new, proverb, in, his, 1995, campaign, chuth, ber, immediacy, is, best, the, proverb, has, since, been, used, in, other, contexts, to, prompt, quick, action, over, 1, 400, new, english, proverbs, are, said, to, have, been, coined, and, gained, currency, in, the, 20th, century, this, process, of, creating, proverbs, is, always, ongoing, so, that, possible, new, proverbs, are, being, created, constantly, those, sayings, that, are, adopted, and, used, by, an, adequate, number, of, people, become, proverbs, in, that, society, the, creation, of, proverbs, in, many, parts, of, the, world, during, the, corona, virus, era, showed, how, quickly, proverbs, and, anti, proverbs, can, be, created, interpreting, proverbs, is, often, complex, but, is, best, done, in, a, context, interpreting, proverbs, from, other, cultures, is, much, more, difficult, than, interpreting, proverbs, in, one, s, own, culture, even, within, english, speaking, cultures, there, is, difference, of, opinion, on, how, to, interpret, the, proverb, a, rolling, stone, gathers, no, moss, some, see, it, as, condemning, a, person, that, keeps, moving, seeing, moss, as, a, positive, thing, such, as, profit, others, see, the, proverb, as, praising, people, that, keep, moving, and, developing, seeing, moss, as, a, negative, thing, such, as, negative, habits, similarly, among, tajik, speakers, the, proverb, one, hand, cannot, clap, has, two, significantly, different, interpretations, most, see, the, proverb, as, promoting, teamwork, others, understand, it, to, mean, that, an, argument, requires, two, people, in, an, extreme, example, one, researcher, working, in, ghana, found, that, for, a, single, akan, proverb, twelve, different, interpretations, were, given, proverb, interpretation, is, not, automatic, even, for, people, within, a, culture, owomoyela, tells, of, a, yoruba, radio, program, that, asked, people, to, interpret, an, unfamiliar, yoruba, proverb, very, few, people, could, do, so, siran, found, that, people, who, had, moved, out, of, the, traditional, vute, speaking, area, of, cameroon, were, not, able, to, interpret, vute, proverbs, correctly, even, though, they, still, spoke, vute, their, interpretations, tended, to, be, literal, children, will, sometimes, interpret, proverbs, in, a, literal, sense, not, yet, knowing, how, to, understand, the, conventionalized, metaphor, interpretation, of, proverbs, is, also, affected, by, injuries, and, diseases, of, the, brain, a, hallmark, of, schizophrenia, is, impaired, proverb, interpretation, proverbs, in, various, languages, are, found, with, a, wide, variety, of, grammatical, structures, in, english, for, example, we, find, the, following, structures, in, addition, to, others, however, people, will, often, quote, only, a, fraction, of, a, proverb, to, invoke, an, entire, proverb, e, g, all, is, fair, instead, of, all, is, fair, in, love, and, war, and, a, rolling, stone, for, a, rolling, stone, gathers, no, moss, the, grammar, of, proverbs, is, not, always, the, typical, grammar, of, the, spoken, language, elements, are, often, moved, around, to, achieve, rhyme, or, focus, another, type, of, grammatical, construction, is, the, wellerism, a, speaker, and, a, quotation, often, with, an, unusual, circumstance, such, as, the, following, a, representative, of, a, wellerism, proverb, found, in, many, languages, the, bride, couldn, t, dance, she, said, the, room, floor, isn, t, flat, another, type, of, grammatical, structure, in, proverbs, is, a, short, dialogue, because, many, proverbs, are, both, poetic, and, traditional, they, are, often, passed, down, in, fixed, forms, though, spoken, language, may, change, many, proverbs, are, often, preserved, in, conservative, even, archaic, form, proverbs, often, contain, archaic, words, and, structures, in, english, for, example, betwixt, is, not, commonly, used, but, a, form, of, it, is, still, heard, or, read, in, the, proverb, there, is, many, a, slip, twixt, the, cup, and, the, lip, the, conservative, form, preserves, the, meter, and, the, rhyme, this, conservative, nature, of, proverbs, can, result, in, archaic, words, and, grammatical, structures, being, preserved, in, individual, proverbs, as, has, been, widely, documented, e, g, in, amharic, nsenga, polish, venda, hebrew, giriama, georgian, karachay, balkar, hausa, uzbek, budu, of, congo, kazakh, in, addition, proverbs, may, still, be, used, in, languages, which, were, once, more, widely, known, in, a, society, but, are, now, no, longer, so, widely, known, for, example, english, speakers, use, some, non, english, proverbs, that, are, drawn, from, languages, that, used, to, be, widely, understood, by, the, educated, class, e, g, c, est, la, vie, from, french, and, carpe, diem, from, latin, proverbs, are, often, handed, down, through, generations, therefore, many, proverbs, refer, to, old, measurements, obscure, professions, outdated, weapons, unknown, plants, animals, names, and, various, other, traditional, matters, therefore, it, is, common, that, they, preserve, words, that, become, less, common, and, archaic, in, broader, society, archaic, proverbs, in, solid, form, such, as, murals, carvings, and, glass, can, be, viewed, even, after, the, language, of, their, form, is, no, longer, widely, understood, such, as, an, anglo, french, proverb, in, a, stained, glass, window, in, york, proverbs, are, often, and, easily, translated, and, transferred, from, one, language, into, another, there, is, nothing, so, uncertain, as, the, derivation, of, proverbs, the, same, proverb, being, often, found, in, all, nations, and, it, is, impossible, to, assign, its, paternity, proverbs, are, often, borrowed, across, lines, of, language, religion, and, even, time, for, example, a, proverb, of, the, approximate, form, no, flies, enter, a, mouth, that, is, shut, is, currently, found, in, spain, france, ethiopia, and, many, countries, in, between, it, is, embraced, as, a, true, local, proverb, in, many, places, and, should, not, be, excluded, in, any, collection, of, proverbs, because, it, is, shared, by, the, neighbors, however, though, it, has, gone, through, multiple, languages, and, millennia, the, proverb, can, be, traced, back, to, an, ancient, babylonian, proverb, another, example, of, a, widely, spread, proverb, is, a, drowning, person, clutches, at, foam, found, in, peshai, of, afghanistan, and, orma, of, kenya, and, presumably, places, in, between, proverbs, about, one, hand, clapping, are, common, across, asia, from, dari, in, afghanistan, to, japan, some, studies, have, been, done, devoted, to, the, spread, of, proverbs, in, certain, regions, such, as, india, and, her, neighbors, and, europe, an, extreme, example, of, the, borrowing, and, spread, of, proverbs, was, the, work, done, to, create, a, corpus, of, proverbs, for, esperanto, where, all, the, proverbs, were, translated, from, other, languages, it, is, often, not, possible, to, trace, the, direction, of, borrowing, a, proverb, between, languages, this, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, borrowing, may, have, been, through, plural, languages, in, some, cases, it, is, possible, to, make, a, strong, case, for, discerning, the, direction, of, the, borrowing, based, on, an, artistic, form, of, the, proverb, in, one, language, but, a, prosaic, form, in, another, language, for, example, in, ethiopia, there, is, a, proverb, of, mothers, and, water, there, is, none, evil, it, is, found, in, amharic, alaaba, language, and, oromo, three, languages, of, ethiopia, the, oromo, version, uses, poetic, features, such, as, the, initial, ha, in, both, clauses, with, the, final, aa, in, the, same, word, and, both, clauses, ending, with, an, also, both, clauses, are, built, with, the, vowel, a, in, the, first, and, last, words, but, the, vowel, i, in, the, one, syllable, central, word, in, contrast, the, amharic, and, alaaba, versions, of, the, proverb, show, little, evidence, of, sound, based, art, however, not, all, languages, have, proverbs, proverbs, are, nearly, universal, across, europe, asia, and, africa, some, languages, in, the, pacific, have, them, such, as, m, ori, with, whakatauk, other, pacific, languages, do, not, e, g, there, are, no, proverbs, in, kilivila, of, the, trobriand, islands, in, the, new, world, there, are, almost, no, proverbs, while, proverbs, abound, in, the, thousands, in, most, cultures, of, the, world, it, remains, a, riddle, why, the, native, americans, have, hardly, any, proverb, tradition, at, all, although, as, mieder, has, commented, the, reason, for, the, visible, lack, of, proverbs, was, probably, the, inability, of, foreign, researchers, to, identify, proverbial, utterances, among, those, peoples, hakamies, has, examined, the, matter, of, whether, proverbs, are, found, universally, a, universal, genre, concluding, that, they, are, not, proverbs, are, used, in, conversation, by, adults, more, than, children, partially, because, adults, have, learned, more, proverbs, than, children, also, using, proverbs, well, is, a, skill, that, is, developed, over, years, additionally, children, have, not, mastered, the, patterns, of, metaphorical, expression, that, are, invoked, in, proverb, use, proverbs, because, they, are, indirect, allow, a, speaker, to, disagree, or, give, advice, in, a, way, that, may, be, less, offensive, studying, actual, proverb, use, in, conversation, however, is, difficult, since, the, researcher, must, wait, for, proverbs, to, happen, an, ethiopian, researcher, tadesse, jaleta, jirata, made, headway, in, such, research, by, attending, and, taking, notes, at, events, where, he, knew, proverbs, were, expected, to, be, part, of, the, conversations, many, authors, have, used, proverbs, in, their, writings, for, a, very, wide, variety, of, literary, genres, epics, novels, poems, short, stories, probably, the, most, famous, user, of, proverbs, in, novels, is, j, r, r, tolkien, in, his, the, hobbit, and, the, lord, of, the, rings, series, herman, melville, is, noted, for, creating, proverbs, in, moby, dick, and, in, his, poetry, also, c, s, lewis, created, a, dozen, proverbs, in, the, horse, and, his, boy, and, mercedes, lackey, created, dozens, for, her, invented, shin, a, in, and, tale, edras, cultures, lackey, s, proverbs, are, notable, in, that, they, are, reminiscent, to, those, of, ancient, asia, e, g, just, because, you, feel, certain, an, enemy, is, lurking, behind, every, bush, it, doesn, t, follow, that, you, are, wrong, is, like, to, before, telling, secrets, on, the, road, look, in, the, bushes, these, authors, are, notable, for, not, only, using, proverbs, as, integral, to, the, development, of, the, characters, and, the, story, line, but, also, for, creating, proverbs, among, medieval, literary, texts, geoffrey, chaucer, s, troilus, and, criseyde, plays, a, special, role, because, chaucer, s, usage, seems, to, challenge, the, truth, value, of, proverbs, by, exposing, their, epistemological, unreliability, rabelais, used, proverbs, to, write, an, entire, chapter, of, gargantua, the, patterns, of, using, proverbs, in, literature, can, change, over, time, a, study, of, classical, chinese, novels, found, proverb, use, as, frequently, as, one, proverb, every, 3, 500, words, in, the, water, margin, shuihu, zhuan, and, one, proverb, every, 4, 000, words, in, wen, jou, hsiang, but, modern, chinese, novels, have, fewer, proverbs, by, far, proverbs, or, portions, of, them, have, been, the, inspiration, for, titles, of, books, the, bigger, they, come, by, erle, stanley, gardner, and, birds, of, a, feather, several, books, with, this, title, devil, in, the, details, multiple, books, with, this, title, sometimes, a, title, alludes, to, a, proverb, but, does, not, actually, quote, much, of, it, such, as, the, gift, horse, s, mouth, by, robert, campbell, some, books, or, stories, have, titles, that, are, twisted, proverbs, anti, proverbs, such, as, no, use, dying, over, spilled, milk, when, life, gives, you, lululemons, and, two, books, titled, blessed, are, the, cheesemakers, the, twisted, proverb, of, last, title, was, also, used, in, the, monty, python, movie, life, of, brian, where, a, person, mishears, one, of, jesus, christ, s, beatitudes, i, think, it, was, blessed, are, the, cheesemakers, some, books, and, stories, are, built, around, a, proverb, some, of, tolkien, s, books, have, been, analyzed, as, having, governing, proverbs, where, the, action, of, a, book, turns, on, or, fulfills, a, proverbial, saying, some, stories, have, been, written, with, a, proverb, overtly, as, an, opening, such, as, a, stitch, in, time, saves, nine, at, the, beginning, of, kitty, s, class, day, one, of, louisa, may, alcott, s, proverb, stories, other, times, a, proverb, appears, at, the, end, of, a, story, summing, up, a, moral, to, the, story, frequently, found, in, aesop, s, fables, such, as, heaven, helps, those, who, help, themselves, from, hercules, and, the, wagoner, in, a, novel, by, the, ivorian, novelist, ahmadou, kourouma, proverbs, are, used, to, conclude, each, chapter, proverbs, have, also, been, used, strategically, by, poets, sometimes, proverbs, or, portions, of, them, or, anti, proverbs, are, used, for, titles, such, as, a, bird, in, the, bush, by, lord, kennet, and, his, stepson, peter, scott, and, the, blind, leading, the, blind, by, lisa, mueller, sometimes, multiple, proverbs, are, important, parts, of, poems, such, as, paul, muldoon, s, symposium, which, begins, you, can, lead, a, horse, to, water, but, you, can, t, make, it, hold, its, nose, to, the, grindstone, and, hunt, with, the, hounds, every, dog, has, a, stitch, in, time, in, finnish, there, are, proverb, poems, written, hundreds, of, years, ago, the, turkish, poet, refiki, wrote, an, entire, poem, by, stringing, proverbs, together, which, has, been, translated, into, english, poetically, yielding, such, verses, as, be, watchful, and, be, wary, but, seldom, grant, a, boon, the, man, who, calls, the, piper, will, also, call, the, tune, eliza, griswold, also, created, a, poem, by, stringing, proverbs, together, libyan, proverbs, translated, into, english, because, proverbs, are, familiar, and, often, pointed, they, have, been, used, by, a, number, of, hip, hop, poets, this, has, been, true, not, only, in, the, usa, birthplace, of, hip, hop, but, also, in, nigeria, since, nigeria, is, so, multilingual, hip, hop, poets, there, use, proverbs, from, various, languages, mixing, them, in, as, it, fits, their, need, sometimes, translating, the, original, for, example, they, forget, say, ogbon, ju, agbaralo, they, forget, that, wisdom, is, greater, than, power, some, authors, have, bent, and, twisted, proverbs, creating, anti, proverbs, for, a, variety, of, literary, effects, for, example, in, the, harry, potter, novels, j, k, rowling, reshapes, a, standard, english, proverb, into, it, s, no, good, crying, over, spilt, potion, and, dumbledore, advises, harry, not, to, count, your, owls, before, they, are, delivered, in, a, slightly, different, use, of, reshaping, proverbs, in, the, aubrey, maturin, series, of, historical, naval, novels, by, patrick, o, brian, capt, jack, aubrey, humorously, mangles, and, mis, splices, proverbs, such, as, never, count, the, bear, s, skin, before, it, is, hatched, and, there, s, a, good, deal, to, be, said, for, making, hay, while, the, iron, is, hot, earlier, than, o, brian, s, aubrey, beatrice, grimshaw, also, used, repeated, splicings, of, proverbs, in, the, mouth, of, an, eccentric, marquis, to, create, a, memorable, character, in, the, sorcerer, s, stone, such, as, the, proof, of, the, pudding, sweeps, clean, p, 109, and, a, stitch, in, time, is, as, good, as, a, mile, p, 97, because, proverbs, are, so, much, a, part, of, the, language, and, culture, authors, have, sometimes, used, proverbs, in, historical, fiction, effectively, but, anachronistically, before, the, proverb, was, actually, known, for, example, the, novel, ramage, and, the, rebels, by, dudley, pope, is, set, in, approximately, 1800, captain, ramage, reminds, his, adversary, you, are, supposed, to, know, that, it, is, dangerous, to, change, horses, in, midstream, p, 259, with, another, allusion, to, the, same, proverb, three, pages, later, however, the, proverb, about, changing, horses, in, midstream, is, reliably, dated, to, 1864, so, the, proverb, could, not, have, been, known, or, used, by, a, character, from, that, period, some, authors, have, used, so, many, proverbs, that, there, have, been, entire, books, written, cataloging, their, proverb, usage, such, as, charles, dickens, agatha, christie, george, bernard, shaw, miguel, de, cervantes, and, friedrich, nietzsche, on, the, non, fiction, side, proverbs, have, also, been, used, by, authors, for, articles, that, have, no, connection, to, the, study, of, proverbs, some, have, been, used, as, the, basis, for, book, titles, e, g, i, shop, therefore, i, am, compulsive,

when, the, proverb, is, well, known, viewers, are, able, to, recognize, the, proverb, and, understand, the, image, appropriately, but, if, viewers, do, not, recognize, the, proverb, much, of, the, effect, of, the, image, is, lost, for, example, there, is, a, japanese, painting, in, the, bonsai, museum, in, saitama, city, that, depicted, flowers, on, a, dead, tree, but, only, when, the, curator,

on, proverbs, in, visual, form, has, been, prepared, by, mieder, and, sobieski, 1999, interpreting, visual, images, of, proverbs, is, subjective, but, familiarity, with, the, depicted, proverb, helps, some, artists, have, used, proverbs, and, anti, proverbs, for, titles, of, their, paintings, alluding, to, a, proverb, rather, than, picturing, it, for, example, vivienne, lewitt, painted, a, piece, titled, if, the, shoe, doesn, t, fit, must, we, change, the, foot, which, shows, neither, foot, nor, shoe, but, a, woman, counting, her, money, as, she, contemplates, different, options, when, buying,

proverbs, such, as, visually, depicting, a, proverb, literally, or, twisting, the, text, as, an, anti, proverb, an, example, with, all, of, these, traits, is, a, cartoon, showing, a, waitress, delivering, two, plates, with, worms, on, them, telling, the, customers, two, early, bird, specials, here, ya, go, the, traditional, three, wise, monkeys, were, depicted, in, bizarro, with, different,

one, resulting, in, such, humorous, results, as, don, t, change, horses, unless, you, can, lift, those, heavy, diapers, editorial, cartoons, can, use, proverbs, to, make, their, points, with, extra, force, as, they, can, invoke, the, wisdom, of, society, not, just, the, opinion, of, the, editors, in, an, example, that, invoked, a, proverb, only, visually, when, a, us, government, agency, gsa, was, caught, spending, money, extravagantly, a, cartoon, showed, a, black, pot, labeled, congress, telling, a, black, kettle, labeled, gsa, stop, wasting, the, taxpayers, money, it, may, have, taken, some, readers, a, moment, of, pondering, to, understand, it, but, the, impact, of, the, message, was, the, stronger, for, it, cartoons, with, proverbs, are, so, common, that, wolfgang, mieder, has, published, a, collected, volume, of, them, many, of, them, editorial, cartoons, for, example, a, german, editorial, cartoon, linked, a, current, politician, to, the, nazis, showing, him, with, a, bottle, of, swastika, labeled, wine, and, the, caption, in, vino, veritas, one, cartoonist, very, self, consciously, drew, and, wrote, cartoons, based, on, proverbs, for, the, university, of, vermont, student, newspaper, the, water, tower, under, the, title, proverb, place, proverbs, are, frequently, used, in, advertising, often, in, slightly, modified, form, ford, once, advertised, its, thunderbird, with, one, drive, is, worth, a, thousand, words, mieder, 2004b, 84, this, is, doubly, interesting, since, the, underlying, proverb, behind, this, one, picture, is, worth, a, thousand, words, was, originally, introduced, into, the, english, proverb, repertoire, in, an, ad, for, televisions, mieder, 2004b, 83, a, few, of, the, many, proverbs, adapted, and, used, in, advertising, include, the, geico, company, has, created, a, series, of, television, ads, that, are, built, around, proverbs, such, as, a, bird, in, the, hand, is, worth, two, in, the, bush, and, the, pen, is,

seda, ba, er, oban, has, studied, the, use, of, proverbs, in, turkish, advertising, tatira, has, given, a, number, of, examples, of, proverbs, used, in, advertising, in, zimbabwe, however, unlike, the, examples, given, above, in, english, all, of, which, are, anti, proverbs, tatira, s, examples, are, standard, proverbs, where, the, english, proverbs, above, are, meant, to, make, a, potential, customer, smile, in, one, of, the, zimbabwean, examples, both, the, content, of, the, proverb, and, the, fact, that, it, is, phrased, as, a, proverb, secure, the, idea, of, a, secure, time, honored, relationship, between, the, company, and, the, individuals, when, newer, buses, were, imported, owners, of, older, buses, compensated, by, painting, a, traditional, proverb, on, the, sides, of, their,

that, to, be, sure, is, folk, wisdom, when, there, are, such, counter, proverbs, each, can, be, used, in, its, own, appropriate, situation, and, neither, is, intended, to, be, a, universal, truth, the, concept, of, counter, proverb, is, more, about, pairs, of, contradictory, proverbs, than, about, the, use, of, proverbs, to, counter, each, other, in, an, argument, for, example, from, the, tafi, language, of, ghana, the, following, pair, of, proverbs, are, counter, to, each, other, but, are, each, used, in, appropriate, contexts, a, co, wife, who, is, too, powerful, for, you, you, address,

though, indeed, they, were, used, in, an, argument, but, the, same, work, contains, an, appendix, with, many, examples, of, proverbs, used, in, arguing, for, contrary, positions, but, proverbs, that, are, not, inherently, contradictory, such, as, one, is, better, off, with, hope, of, a, cow, s, return, than, news, of, its, death, countered, by, if, you, don, t, know, a, goat, you, mock, at, its,

explained, that, in, his, large, collection, a, few, proverbs, are, mutually, contradictory, we, can, be, sure, that, the, badagas, do, not, see, the, matter, that, way, and, would, explain, such, apparent, contradictions, by, reasoning, that, proverb, x, is, used, in, one, context, while, y, is, used, in, quite, another, comparing, korean, proverbs, when, you, compare, two, proverbs, often,

studies, there, are, twelve, publications, listed, as, describing, metaproverbs, other, metaproverbs, include, there, is, a, growing, interest, in, deliberately, using, proverbs, to, achieve, goals, usually, to, support, and, promote, changes, in, society, proverbs, have, also, been, used, for, public, health, promotion, such, as, promoting, breast, feeding, with, a, shawl, bearing, a, swahili,

catalyze, the, collection, of, proverbs, from, smaller, languages, and, the, application, of, them, in, a, wide, variety, of, church, related, ministries, resulting, in, publications, of, collections, and, applications, this, attention, to, proverbs, by, those, in, christian, ministries, is, not, new, many, pioneering, proverb, collections, having, been, collected, and, published, by, christian, workers, u, s, navy, captain, edward, zellem, pioneered, the, use, of, afghan, proverbs, as, a, positive, relationship, building, tool, during, the, war, in, afghanistan, and, in, 2012, he, published, two, bilingual, collections, of, afghan, proverbs, in, dari, and, english, part, of, an, effort, of, nationbuilding, followed, by, a, volume, of, pashto, proverbs, in, 2014, there, is, a, longstanding, debate, among, proverb, scholars, as, to, whether, the, cultural, values, of, specific, language, communities, are, reflected, to, varying, degree, in, their, proverbs, many, claim, that, the, proverbs, of, a, particular, culture, reflect, the, values, of, that, specific, culture, at, least, to, some, degree, many, writers, have, asserted, that, the, proverbs, of, their, cultures, reflect, their, culture, and, values, this, can, be, seen, in, such, titles, as, the, following, an, introduction, to, kasena, society, and, culture, through, their, proverbs, prejudice, power, and, poverty, in, haiti, a, study, of, a, nation, s, culture, as, seen, through, its, proverbs, proverbiality, and, worldview, in, maltese, and, arabic, proverbs, fatalistic, traits, in, finnish, proverbs, vietnamese, cultural, patterns, and, values, as, expressed, in, proverbs, the, wisdom, and, philosophy, of, the, gikuyu, proverbs, the, kihooto, worldview, spanish, grammar, and, culture, through, proverbs, and, how, russian, proverbs, present, the, russian, national, character, kohistani, has, written, a, thesis, to, show, how, understanding, afghan, dari, proverbs, will, help, europeans, understand, afghan, culture, however, a, number, of, scholars, argue, that, such, claims, are, not, valid, they, have, used, a, variety, of, arguments, grauberg, argues, that, since, many, proverbs, are, so, widely, circulated, they, are, reflections, of, broad, human, experience, not, any, one, culture, s, unique, viewpoint, related, to, this, line, of, argument, from, a, collection, of, 199, american, proverbs, jente, showed, that, only, 10, were, coined, in, the, usa, so, that, most, of, these, proverbs, would, not, reflect, uniquely, american, values, giving, another, line, of, reasoning, that, proverbs, should, not, be, trusted, as, a, simplistic, guide, to, cultural, values, mieder, once, observed, proverbs, come, and, go, that, is, antiquated, proverbs, with, messages, and, images, we, no, longer, relate, to, are, dropped, from, our, proverb, repertoire, while, new, proverbs, are, created, to, reflect, the, mores, and, values, of, our, time, so, old, proverbs, still, in, circulation, might, reflect, past, values, of, a, culture, more, than, its, current, values, also, within, any, language, s, proverb, repertoire, there, may, be, counter, proverbs, proverbs, that, contradict, each, other, on, the, surface, see, section, above, when, examining, such, counter, proverbs, it, is, difficult, to, discern, an, underlying, cultural, value, with, so, many, barriers, to, a, simple, calculation, of, values, directly, from, proverbs, some, feel, one, cannot, draw, conclusions, about, values, of, speakers, simply, from, the, texts, of, proverbs, many, outsiders, have, studied, proverbs, to, discern, and, understand, cultural, values, and, world, view, of, cultural, communities, these, outsider, scholars, are, confident, that, they, have, gained, insights, into, the, local, cultures, by, studying, proverbs, but, this, is, not, universally, accepted, seeking, empirical, evidence, to, evaluate, the, question, of, whether, proverbs, reflect, a, culture, s, values, some, have, counted, the, proverbs, that, support, various, values, for, example, moon, lists, what, he, sees, as, the, top, ten, core, cultural, values, of, the, builsa, society, of, ghana, as, exemplified, by, proverbs, he, found, that, 18, of, the, proverbs, he, analyzed, supported, the, value, of, being, a, member, of, the, community, rather, than, being, independent, this, was, corroboration, to, other, evidence, that, collective, community, membership, is, an, important, value, among, the, builsa, in, studying, tajik, proverbs, bell, notes, that, the, proverbs, in, his, corpus, consistently, illustrate, tajik, values, and, the, most, often, observed, proverbs, reflect, the, focal, and, specific, values, discerned, in, the, thesis, a, study, of, english, proverbs, created, since, 1900, showed, in, the, 1960s, a, sudden, and, significant, increase, in, proverbs, that, reflected, more, casual, attitudes, toward, sex, since, the, 1960s, was, also, the, decade, of, the, sexual, revolution, this, shows, a, strong, statistical, link, between, the, changed, values, of, the, decades, and, a, change, in, the, proverbs, coined, and, used, another, study, mining, the, same, volume, counted, anglo, american, proverbs, about, religion, to, show, that, proverbs, indicate, attitudes, toward, religion, are, going, downhill, there, are, many, examples, where, cultural, values, have, been, explained, and, illustrated, by, proverbs, for, example, from, india, the, concept, that, birth, determines, one, s, nature, is, illustrated, in, the, oft, repeated, proverb, there, can, be, no, friendship, between, grass, eaters, and, meat, eaters, between, a, food, and, its, eater, proverbs, have, been, used, to, explain, and, illustrate, the, fulani, cultural, value, of, pulaaku, but, using, proverbs, to, illustrate, a, cultural, value, is, not, the, same, as, using, a, collection, of, proverbs, to, discern, cultural, values, in, a, comparative, study, between, spanish, and, jordanian, proverbs, it, is, defined, the, social, imagination, for, the, mother, as, an, archetype, in, the, context, of, role, transformation, and, in, contrast, with, the, roles, of, husband, son, and, brother, in, two, societies, which, might, be, occasionally, associated, with, sexist, and, or, rural, ideologies, some, scholars, have, adopted, a, cautious, approach, acknowledging, at, least, a, genuine, though, limited, link, between, cultural, values, and, proverbs, the, cultural, portrait, painted, by, proverbs, may, be, fragmented, contradictory, or, otherwise, at, variance, with, reality, but, must, be, regarded, not, as, accurate, renderings, but, rather, as, tantalizing, shadows, of, the, culture, which, spawned, them, there, is, not, yet, agreement, on, the, issue, of, whether, and, how, much, cultural, values, are, reflected, in, a, culture, s, proverbs, it, is, clear, that, the, soviet, union, believed, that, proverbs, had, a, direct, link, to, the, values, of, a, culture, as, they, used, them, to, try, to, create, changes, in, the, values, of, cultures, within, their, sphere, of, domination, sometimes, they, took, old, russian, proverbs, and, altered, them, into, socialist, forms, these, new, proverbs, promoted, socialism, and, its, attendant, values, such, as, atheism, and, collectivism, e, g, bread, is, given, to, us, not, by, christ, but, by, machines, and, collective, farms, and, a, good, harvest, is, had, only, by, a, collective, farm, they, did, not, limit, their, efforts, to, russian, but, also, produced, newly, coined, proverbs, that, conformed, to, socialist, thought, in, tajik, and, other, languages, of, the, ussr, many, proverbs, from, around, the, world, address, matters, of, ethics, and, expected, of, behavior, therefore, it, is, not, surprising, that, proverbs, are, often, important, texts, in, religions, the, most, obvious, example, is, the, book, of, proverbs, in, the, bible, additional, proverbs, have, also, been, coined, to, support, religious, values, such, as, the, following, from, dari, of, afghanistan, in, childhood, you, re, playful, in, youth, you, re, lustful, in, old, age, you, re, feeble, so, when, will, you, before, god, be, worshipful, clearly, proverbs, in, religion, are, not, limited, to, monotheists, among, the, badagas, of, india, sahivite, hindus, there, is, a, traditional, proverb, catch, hold, of, and, join, with, the, man, who, has, placed, sacred, ash, proverbs, are, widely, associated, with, large, religions, that, draw, from, sacred, books, but, they, are, also, used, for, religious, purposes, among, groups, with, their, own, traditional, religions, such, as, the, guji, oromo, the, broadest, comparative, study, of, proverbs, across, religions, is, the, eleven, religions, and, their, proverbial, lore, a, comparative, study, a, reference, book, to, the, eleven, surviving, major, religions, of, the, world, by, selwyn, gurney, champion, from, 1945, some, sayings, from, sacred, books, also, become, proverbs, even, if, they, were, not, obviously, proverbs, in, the, original, passage, of, the, sacred, book, for, example, many, quote, be, sure, your, sin, will, find, you, out, as, a, proverb, from, the, bible, but, there, is, no, evidence, it, was, proverbial, in, its, original, usage, numbers, 32, 23, not, all, religious, references, in, proverbs, are, positive, some, are, cynical, such, as, the, tajik, and, uzbek, proverb, do, as, the, mullah, says, not, as, he, does, an, indian, proverb, is, cynical, about, devotees, of, hinduism, when, in, distress, a, man, calls, on, rama, in, the, context, of, tibetan, buddhism, some, ladakhi, proverbs, mock, the, lamas, e, g, if, the, lama, s, own, head, does, not, come, out, cleanly, how, will, he, do, the, drawing, upwards, of, the, dead, used, for, deriding, the, immoral, life, of, the, lamas, there, is, an, italian, proverb, that, mocks, churches, one, barrel, of, wine, can, work, more, miracles, than, a, church, full, of, saints, there, are, so, many, spanish, proverbs, mocking, catholic, clergy, that, there, is, even, a, book, of, them, refranero, anticlerical, armenians, have, a, proverb, that, mocks, priests, outside, a, priest, inside, a, beast, proverbs, do, not, have, to, explicitly, mention, religion, or, religious, figures, to, be, used, to, mock, a, religion, seen, in, the, fact, that, in, a, collection, of, 555, proverbs, from, the, lur, a, muslim, group, in, iran, the, explanations, for, 15, of, them, use, illustrations, that, mock, muslim, clerics, dammann, wrote, in, the, traditional, religions, specific, religious, ideas, recede, into, the, background, the, influence, of, islam, manifests, itself, in, african, proverbs, christian, influences, on, the, contrary, are, rare, if, widely, true, in, africa, this, is, likely, due, to, the, longer, presence, of, islam, in, many, parts, of, africa, reflection, of, christian, values, is, common, in, amharic, proverbs, of, ethiopia, an, area, that, has, had, a, presence, of, christianity, for, well, over, 1, 000, years, the, islamic, proverbial, reproduction, may, also, be, shown, in, the, image, of, some, animals, such, as, the, dog, although, dog, is, portrayed, in, many, european, proverbs, as, the, most, faithful, friend, of, man, it, is, represented, in, some, islamic, countries, as, impure, dirty, vile, cowardly, ungrateful, and, treacherous, in, addition, to, links, to, negative, human, superstitions, such, as, loneliness, indifference, and, bad, luck, though, much, proverb, scholarship, is, done, by, literary, scholars, those, studying, the, human, mind, have, used, proverbs, in, a, variety, of, studies, one, of, the, earliest, studies, in, this,
