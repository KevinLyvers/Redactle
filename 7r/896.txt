terrorism, in, its, broadest, sense, is, the, use, of, violence, against, non, combatants, to, achieve, political, or, ideological, aims, the, term, is, used, in, this, regard, primarily, to, refer, to, intentional, violence, during, peacetime, or, in, the, context, of, war, against, non, combatants, mostly, civilians, and, neutral, military, personnel, there, are, various, different, definitions, of, terrorism, with, no, universal, agreement, about, it, different, definitions, of, terrorism, emphasize, its, randomness, its, aim, to, instill, fear, and, its, broader, impact, beyond, its, immediate, victims, modern, terrorism, evolving, from, earlier, iterations, employs, various, tactics, to, pursue, political, goals, often, leveraging, fear, as, a, strategic, tool, to, influence, decision, makers, by, targeting, densely, populated, public, areas, such, as, transportation, hubs, airports, shopping, centers, tourist, attractions, and, nightlife, venues, terrorists, aim, to, instill, widespread, insecurity, prompting, policy, changes, through, psychological, manipulation, and, undermining, confidence, in, security, measures, the, terms, terrorist, and, terrorism, originated, during, the, french, revolution, of, the, late, 18th, century, but, became, widely, used, internationally, and, gained, worldwide, attention, in, the, 1970s, during, the, troubles, in, northern, ireland, the, basque, conflict, and, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, the, increased, use, of, suicide, attacks, from, the, 1980s, onwards, was, typified, by, the, 2001, september, 11, attacks, in, the, united, states, the, global, terrorism, database, maintained, by, the, university, of, maryland, college, park, has, recorded, more, than, 61, 000, incidents, of, non, state, terrorism, resulting, in, at, least, 140, 000, deaths, between, 2000, and, 2014, various, organizations, have, used, terrorism, to, achieve, their, objectives, these, include, left, wing, and, right, wing, political, organizations, nationalist, groups, religious, groups, revolutionaries, and, ruling, governments, in, recent, decades, hybrid, terrorist, organizations, have, emerged, incorporating, both, military, and, political, arms, the, term, terrorism, itself, was, originally, used, to, describe, the, actions, of, the, jacobin, club, during, the, reign, of, terror, in, the, french, revolution, terror, is, nothing, other, than, justice, prompt, severe, inflexible, said, jacobin, leader, maximilien, robespierre, in, 1795, edmund, burke, denounced, the, jacobins, for, letting, thousands, of, those, hell, hounds, called, terrorists, loose, on, the, people, of, france, john, calvin, s, rule, over, geneva, in, the, 16th, century, has, also, been, described, as, a, reign, of, terror, the, terms, terrorism, and, terrorist, gained, renewed, currency, in, the, 1970s, as, a, result, of, the, palestinian, liberation, organization, plo, the, irish, republican, army, ira, the, basque, separatist, group, eta, and, the, operations, of, groups, such, as, the, red, army, faction, leila, khaled, was, described, as, a, terrorist, in, a, 1970, issue, of, life, magazine, a, number, of, books, on, terrorism, were, published, in, the, 1970s, the, topic, came, further, to, the, fore, after, the, 1983, beirut, barracks, bombings, and, again, after, the, 2001, september, 11, attacks, and, the, 2002, bali, bombings, no, definition, of, terrorism, has, gained, universal, agreement, challenges, emerge, due, to, the, politically, and, emotionally, charged, nature, of, the, term, the, double, standards, used, in, applying, it, and, disagreement, over, the, nature, of, terrorist, acts, and, limits, of, the, right, to, self, determination, harvard, law, professor, richard, baxter, a, leading, expert, on, the, law, of, war, was, a, skeptic, we, have, cause, to, regret, that, a, legal, concept, of, terrorism, was, ever, inflicted, upon, us, the, term, is, imprecise, it, is, ambiguous, and, above, all, it, serves, no, operative, legal, purpose, different, legal, systems, and, government, agencies, employ, diverse, definitions, of, terrorism, with, governments, showing, hesitation, in, establishing, a, universally, accepted, legally, binding, definition, title, 18, of, the, united, states, code, defines, terrorism, as, acts, that, are, intended, to, intimidate, or, coerce, civilians, or, government, the, international, community, has, been, slow, to, formulate, a, universally, agreed, legally, binding, definition, of, this, crime, and, has, been, unable, to, conclude, a, comprehensive, convention, on, international, terrorism, that, incorporates, a, single, all, encompassing, legally, binding, criminal, law, definition, of, terrorism, these, difficulties, arise, from, the, fact, that, the, term, terrorism, is, politically, and, emotionally, charged, the, international, community, has, instead, adopted, a, series, of, sectoral, conventions, that, define, and, criminalize, various, types, of, terrorist, activities, counterterrorism, analyst, bruce, hoffman, has, noted, that, it, is, not, only, individual, agencies, within, the, same, governmental, apparatus, that, cannot, agree, on, a, single, definition, of, terrorism, experts, and, other, long, established, scholars, in, the, field, are, equally, incapable, of, reaching, a, consensus, in, 1992, terrorism, studies, scholar, alex, p, schmid, proposed, a, simple, definition, to, the, united, nations, commission, on, crime, prevention, and, criminal, justice, ccpcj, as, peacetime, equivalents, of, war, crimes, but, it, was, not, accepted, in, 2006, it, was, estimated, that, there, were, over, 109, different, definitions, of, terrorism, the, use, of, the, term, in, the, israel, palestine, conflict, has, given, rise, to, controversies, concerning, the, vagueness, of, how, terrorists, are, defined, and, identified, when, asked, to, clarify, the, term, in, the, context, of, the, ongoing, 2023, 4, israel, hamas, war, and, an, hostage, rescue, operation, in, which, over, 270, palestinians, were, killed, and, 4, hostages, rescued, the, commander, of, israel, s, drone, fleet, answered, we, attacked, on, the, side, of, the, street, to, drive, civilians, away, and, whoever, did, not, flee, even, if, he, was, unarmed, as, far, as, we, were, concerned, was, a, terrorist, everyone, we, killed, should, have, been, killed, until, david, c, rapoport, published, his, seminal, article, fear, and, trembling, terrorism, in, three, religious, traditions, in, 1984, scholars, of, terrorism, had, largely, assumed, that, terrorism, was, a, modern, phenomenon, earlier, published, studies, like, paul, wilkinson, had, considered, terrorism, to, be, a, product, of, 19th, century, revolutionary, politics, technological, developments, like, the, pistol, and, bomb, making, were, considered, instrumental, to, the, relentless, onslaught, of, assassinations, terrorism, bombings, and, political, violence, in, the, 19th, century, rapoport, proposed, three, case, studies, to, demonstrate, ancient, lineage, of, religious, terrorism, which, he, called, sacred, terror, the, thugs, the, assassins, and, the, jewish, sicarii, zealots, rapoport, argued, religious, terrorism, has, been, ongoing, since, ancient, times, and, that, there, are, signs, that, it, is, reviving, in, new, and, unusual, forms, he, is, the, first, to, propose, that, religious, doctrines, were, more, important, than, political, rationales, for, some, terrorist, groups, rapoport, s, work, has, since, become, the, basis, of, the, model, of, new, terrorism, proposed, by, bruce, hoffman, and, developed, by, other, scholars, new, terrorism, has, had, an, unparalleled, impact, on, policymaking, critics, have, pointed, out, that, the, model, is, politically, charged, and, over, simplified, the, underlying, historical, assertions, have, received, less, critical, attention, according, to, the, oxford, handbook, on, the, history, of, terrorism, since, the, publication, of, rapoport, s, article, it, has, become, seemingly, pre, requisite, for, standard, works, on, terrorism, to, cite, the, three, case, studies, and, to, reproduce, uncritically, its, findings, in, lieu, of, empirical, research, authors, tend, to, crudely, paraphrase, rapoport, and, the, assumed, relevance, of, thuggee, to, the, study, of, modern, terrorism, is, taken, for, granted, yet, the, significance, of, the, article, is, not, simply, a, matter, of, citations, it, has, also, provided, the, foundation, for, what, has, become, known, as, the, new, terrorism, paradigm, while, rapoport, did, not, suggest, which, late, 20th, century, groups, might, exemplify, the, implied, recurrence, of, holy, terror, bruce, hoffman, recognized, today, as, one, of, the, world, s, leading, terrorism, experts, did, not, hesitate, to, do, so, a, decade, after, rapoport, s, article, hoffman, picked, up, the, mantle, and, taking, the, three, case, studies, as, inspiration, he, formulated, a, model, of, contemporary, holy, terror, or, as, he, defined, it, terrorism, motivated, by, a, religious, imperative, completely, distinct, from, secular, terrorists, hoffman, argued, that, religious, terrorists, carry, out, indiscriminate, acts, of, violence, as, a, divine, duty, with, no, consideration, for, political, efficacy, their, aim, is, transcendental, and, holy, terror, constitutes, an, end, in, itself, hoffman, s, concept, has, since, been, taken, up, and, developed, by, a, number, of, other, writers, including, walter, laquer, steven, simon, and, daniel, daniel, benjamen, and, rebranded, as, the, new, terrorism, arguably, the, first, organization, to, use, modern, terrorist, techniques, was, the, irish, republican, brotherhood, founded, in, 1858, as, a, revolutionary, irish, nationalist, group, that, carried, out, attacks, in, england, the, group, initiated, the, fenian, dynamite, campaign, in, 1881, one, of, the, first, modern, terror, campaigns, instead, of, earlier, forms, of, terrorism, based, on, political, assassination, this, campaign, used, timed, explosives, with, the, express, aim, of, sowing, fear, in, the, very, heart, of, metropolitan, britain, in, order, to, achieve, political, gains, another, early, terrorist, type, group, was, narodnaya, volya, founded, in, russia, in, 1878, as, a, revolutionary, anarchist, group, inspired, by, sergei, nechayev, and, propaganda, by, the, deed, theorist, carlo, pisacane, the, group, developed, ideas, such, as, targeted, killing, of, the, leaders, of, oppression, which, were, to, become, the, hallmark, of, subsequent, violence, by, small, non, state, groups, and, they, were, convinced, that, the, developing, technologies, of, the, age, such, as, the, invention, of, dynamite, which, they, were, the, first, anarchist, group, to, make, widespread, use, of, enabled, them, to, strike, directly, and, with, discrimination, in, 1920, leon, trotsky, wrote, terrorism, and, communism, to, justify, the, red, terror, and, defend, the, moral, superiority, of, revolutionary, terrorism, depending, on, the, country, the, political, system, and, the, time, in, history, the, types, of, terrorism, are, varying, in, early, 1975, the, law, enforcement, assistant, administration, in, the, united, states, formed, the, national, advisory, committee, on, criminal, justice, standards, and, goals, one, of, the, five, volumes, that, the, committee, wrote, was, titled, disorders, and, terrorism, produced, by, the, task, force, on, disorders, and, terrorism, under, the, direction, of, h, h, a, cooper, director, of, the, task, force, staff, the, task, force, defines, terrorism, as, a, tactic, or, technique, by, means, of, which, a, violent, act, or, the, threat, thereof, is, used, for, the, prime, purpose, of, creating, overwhelming, fear, for, coercive, purposes, it, classified, disorders, and, terrorism, into, seven, categories, other, sources, have, defined, the, typology, of, terrorism, in, different, ways, for, example, broadly, classifying, it, into, domestic, terrorism, and, international, terrorism, or, using, categories, such, as, vigilante, terrorism, or, insurgent, terrorism, some, ways, the, typology, of, terrorism, may, be, defined, are, according, to, the, global, terrorism, index, by, the, university, of, maryland, college, park, religious, extremism, has, overtaken, national, separatism, and, become, the, main, driver, of, terrorist, attacks, around, the, world, since, 9, 11, there, has, been, a, five, fold, increase, in, deaths, from, terrorist, attacks, the, majority, of, incidents, over, the, past, several, years, can, be, tied, to, groups, with, a, religious, agenda, before, 2000, it, was, nationalist, separatist, terrorist, organizations, such, as, the, ira, and, chechen, rebels, who, were, behind, the, most, attacks, the, number, of, incidents, from, nationalist, separatist, groups, has, remained, relatively, stable, in, the, years, since, while, religious, extremism, has, grown, the, prevalence, of, islamist, groups, in, iraq, afghanistan, pakistan, nigeria, and, syria, is, the, main, driver, behind, these, trends, the, emergence, of, hezbollah, in, 1982, marked, a, pivotal, moment, in, terrorism, s, history, the, shiite, islamist, group, rooted, in, lebanon, drew, inspiration, from, the, iranian, revolution, and, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, s, teachings, responding, to, the, 1982, lebanon, war, beyond, pursuing, revolutionary, goals, hezbollah, members, were, deeply, concerned, about, the, social, conditions, of, shiite, communities, across, the, middle, east, their, activities, in, lebanon, during, the, 1980s, garnered, support, among, local, shiites, leading, to, the, rise, of, smaller, terrorist, groups, notably, the, islamic, jihad, hamas, the, main, islamist, movement, in, the, palestinian, territories, was, formed, by, palestinian, imam, ahmed, yassin, in, 1987, hamas, members, seek, their, identity, in, their, islamic, roots, hamas, maintains, an, uncompromising, and, maximalist, stance, emphasizing, the, complete, liberation, of, the, sacred, land, of, palestine, they, interpret, as, demanded, by, allah, who, will, repay, martyrs, for, this, cause, with, life, everlasting, hamas, ideology, includes, antisemitic, elements, and, according, to, some, studies, even, incorporates, genocidal, aspirations, in, the, periods, of, 1994, 1996, and, 2001, 2007, hamas, orchestrated, a, series, of, suicide, bombings, primarily, directed, at, civilian, targets, in, israel, killing, over, 1, 000, israeli, civilians, following, their, takeover, of, the, gaza, strip, in, 2007, the, group, has, launched, thousands, of, rockets, towards, israeli, population, centers, five, of, the, terrorist, groups, that, have, been, most, active, since, 2001, are, hamas, boko, haram, al, qaeda, the, taliban, and, isil, these, groups, have, been, most, active, in, iraq, afghanistan, pakistan, nigeria, and, syria, eighty, percent, of, all, deaths, from, terrorism, occurred, in, these, five, countries, in, 2015, four, islamic, extremist, groups, were, responsible, for, 74, of, all, deaths, from, islamic, terrorism, isis, boko, haram, the, taliban, and, al, qaeda, according, to, the, global, terrorism, index, 2016, since, approximately, 2000, these, incidents, have, occurred, on, a, global, scale, affecting, not, only, muslim, majority, states, in, africa, and, asia, but, also, states, with, non, muslim, majority, such, as, united, states, united, kingdom, france, germany, spain, belgium, sweden, russia, australia, canada, sri, lanka, israel, china, india, and, philippines, such, attacks, have, targeted, both, muslims, and, non, muslims, however, the, majority, affect, muslims, themselves, terrorism, in, pakistan, has, become, a, great, problem, from, the, summer, of, 2007, until, late, 2009, more, than, 1, 500, people, were, killed, in, suicide, and, other, attacks, on, civilians, for, reasons, attributed, to, a, number, of, causes, sectarian, violence, between, sunni, and, shia, muslims, easy, availability, of, guns, and, explosives, the, existence, of, a, kalashnikov, culture, an, influx, of, ideologically, driven, muslims, based, in, or, near, pakistan, who, originated, from, various, nations, around, the, world, and, the, subsequent, war, against, the, pro, soviet, afghans, in, the, 1980s, which, blew, back, into, pakistan, the, presence, of, islamist, insurgent, groups, and, forces, such, as, the, taliban, and, lashkar, e, taiba, on, july, 2, 2013, in, lahore, 50, muslim, scholars, of, the, sunni, ittehad, council, sic, issued, a, collective, fatwa, against, suicide, bombings, the, killing, of, innocent, people, bomb, attacks, and, targeted, killings, declaring, them, as, haraam, or, forbidden, in, 2015, the, southern, poverty, law, center, released, a, report, on, terrorism, in, the, united, states, the, report, titled, the, age, of, the, wolf, analyzed, 62, incidents, and, found, that, between, 2009, and, 2015, more, people, have, been, killed, in, america, by, non, islamic, domestic, terrorists, than, jihadists, the, virulent, racist, and, antisemitic, ideology, of, the, ultra, right, wing, christian, identity, movement, is, usually, accompanied, by, anti, government, sentiments, adherents, of, christian, identity, are, not, connected, with, specific, christian, denominations, and, they, believe, that, whites, of, european, descent, can, be, traced, back, to, the, lost, tribes, of, israel, and, many, consider, jews, to, be, the, satanic, offspring, of, eve, and, the, serpent, this, group, has, committed, hate, crimes, bombings, and, other, acts, of, terrorism, its, influence, ranges, from, the, ku, klux, klan, and, neo, nazi, groups, to, the, anti, government, militia, and, sovereign, citizen, movements, christian, identity, s, origins, can, be, traced, back, to, anglo, israelism, which, held, the, view, that, the, british, people, were, descendants, of, ancient, israelites, however, in, the, united, states, the, ideology, started, to, become, rife, with, anti, semitism, and, eventually, christian, identity, theology, diverged, from, the, philo, semitic, anglo, israelism, and, developed, what, is, known, as, the, two, seed, theory, according, to, the, two, seed, theory, the, jewish, people, are, descended, from, cain, and, the, serpent, not, from, shem, the, white, european, seedline, is, descended, from, the, lost, tribes, of, israel, they, hold, themselves, to, god, s, laws, not, to, man, s, laws, and, they, do, not, feel, bound, to, a, government, that, they, consider, run, by, jews, and, the, new, world, order, the, ku, klux, klan, is, widely, denounced, by, christian, denominations, israel, has, had, problems, with, jewish, religious, terrorism, even, before, independence, in, 1948, during, british, mandate, over, palestine, the, irgun, were, among, the, zionist, groups, labelled, as, terrorist, organisations, by, the, british, authorities, and, united, nations, for, violent, terror, attacks, against, britons, and, arabs, another, extremist, group, the, lehi, openly, declared, its, members, as, terrorists, historian, william, cleveland, stated, many, jews, justified, any, action, even, terrorism, taken, in, the, cause, of, the, creation, of, a, jewish, state, in, 1995, yigal, amir, assassinated, israeli, prime, minister, yitzhak, rabin, for, amir, killing, rabin, was, an, exemplary, act, that, symbolized, the, fight, against, an, illegitimate, government, that, was, prepared, to, cede, jewish, holy, land, to, the, palestinians, members, of, kach, a, jewish, ultranationalist, party, employed, terrorist, tactics, in, pursuit, of, what, they, viewed, as, religious, imperatives, israel, and, a, few, other, countries, have, designated, the, party, as, a, terrorist, group, terrorist, acts, frequently, have, a, political, purpose, based, on, self, determination, claims, ethnonationalist, frustrations, single, issue, causes, like, abortion, or, the, environment, or, other, ideological, or, religious, causes, that, terrorists, claim, are, a, moral, justification, for, their, violent, acts, individuals, and, groups, choose, terrorism, as, a, tactic, because, it, can, attacks, on, collaborators, are, used, to, intimidate, people, from, cooperating, with, the, state, in, order, to, undermine, state, control, this, strategy, was, used, in, ireland, in, kenya, in, algeria, and, in, cyprus, during, their, independence, struggles, stated, motives, for, the, september, 11, attacks, included, inspiring, more, fighters, to, join, the, cause, of, repelling, the, united, states, from, muslim, countries, with, a, successful, high, profile, attack, the, attacks, prompted, some, criticism, from, domestic, and, international, observers, regarding, perceived, injustices, in, u, s, foreign, policy, that, provoked, the, attacks, but, the, larger, practical, effect, was, that, the, united, states, government, declared, a, war, on, terror, that, resulted, in, substantial, military, engagements, in, several, muslim, majority, countries, various, commentators, have, inferred, that, al, qaeda, expected, a, military, response, and, welcomed, it, as, a, provocation, that, would, result, in, more, muslims, fight, the, united, states, some, commentators, believe, that, the, resulting, anger, and, suspicion, directed, toward, innocent, muslims, living, in, western, countries, and, the, indignities, inflicted, upon, them, by, security, forces, and, the, general, public, also, contributes, to, radicalization, of, new, recruits, despite, criticism, that, the, iraqi, government, had, no, involvement, with, the, september, 11, attacks, bush, declared, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, to, be, part, of, the, war, on, terror, the, resulting, backlash, and, instability, enabled, the, rise, of, islamic, state, of, iraq, and, the, levant, and, the, temporary, creation, of, an, islamic, caliphate, holding, territory, in, iraq, and, syria, until, isil, lost, its, territory, through, military, defeats, attacks, used, to, draw, international, attention, to, struggles, that, are, otherwise, unreported, have, included, the, palestinian, airplane, hijackings, in, 1970, and, the, 1975, dutch, train, hostage, crisis, specific, political, or, social, causes, have, included, causes, for, right, wing, terrorism, have, included, white, nationalism, ethnonationalism, fascism, anti, socialism, the, anti, abortion, movement, and, tax, resistance, sometimes, terrorists, on, the, same, side, fight, for, different, reasons, for, example, in, the, chechen, russian, conflict, secular, chechens, using, terrorist, tactics, fighting, for, national, independence, are, allied, with, radical, islamist, terrorists, who, have, arrived, from, other, countries, various, personal, and, social, factors, may, influence, the, personal, choice, of, whether, to, join, a, terrorist, group, or, attempt, an, act, of, terror, including, a, report, conducted, by, paul, gill, john, horgan, and, paige, deckert, found, that, for, lone, wolf, terrorists, ariel, merari, a, psychologist, who, has, studied, the, psychological, profiles, of, suicide, terrorists, since, 1983, through, media, reports, that, contained, biographical, details, interviews, with, the, suicides, families, and, interviews, with, jailed, would, be, suicide, attackers, concluded, that, they, were, unlikely, to, be, psychologically, abnormal, in, comparison, to, economic, theories, of, criminal, behaviour, scott, atran, found, that, suicide, terrorists, exhibit, none, of, the, socially, dysfunctional, attributes, such, as, fatherless, friendless, jobless, situations, or, suicidal, symptoms, by, which, he, means, they, do, not, kill, themselves, simply, out, of, hopelessness, or, a, sense, of, having, nothing, to, lose, abrahm, suggests, that, terrorist, organizations, do, not, select, terrorism, for, its, political, effectiveness, individual, terrorists, tend, to, be, motivated, more, by, a, desire, for, social, solidarity, with, other, members, of, their, organization, than, by, political, platforms, or, strategic, objectives, which, are, often, murky, and, undefined, michael, mousseau, shows, possible, relationships, between, the, type, of, economy, within, a, country, and, ideology, associated, with, terrorism, many, terrorists, have, a, history, of, domestic, violence, terrorism, is, most, common, in, nations, with, intermediate, political, freedom, and, it, is, least, common, in, the, most, democratic, nations, some, examples, of, terrorism, in, non, democratic, nations, include, eta, in, spain, under, francisco, franco, although, the, group, s, activities, increased, sharply, after, franco, s, death, the, organization, of, ukrainian, nationalists, in, pre, war, poland, the, shining, path, in, peru, under, alberto, fujimori, the, kurdistan, workers, party, when, turkey, was, ruled, by, military, leaders, and, the, anc, in, south, africa, according, to, boaz, ganor, modern, terrorism, sees, the, liberal, democratic, state, in, all, its, variations, as, the, perfect, launching, pad, and, a, target, for, its, attacks, moreover, some, terrorist, organizations, particularly, islamist, jihadist, organizations, have, chosen, to, cynically, exploit, democratic, values, and, institutions, to, gain, power, and, status, promote, their, interests, and, achieve, internal, and, international, legitimacy, jihadist, militants, have, shown, an, amivalent, view, towards, democracy, as, they, both, exploit, it, for, their, ends, and, oppose, it, in, their, ideology, various, quotes, from, jihadist, leaders, note, their, disdain, for, democracy, and, their, efforts, to, undermine, it, in, favor, of, islamic, rule, democracies, such, as, japan, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, israel, indonesia, india, spain, germany, italy, and, the, philippines, have, all, experienced, domestic, terrorism, while, a, democratic, nation, espousing, civil, liberties, may, claim, a, sense, of, higher, moral, ground, than, other, regimes, an, act, of, terrorism, within, such, a, state, may, cause, a, dilemma, whether, to, maintain, its, civil, liberties, and, thus, risk, being, perceived, as, ineffective, in, dealing, with, the, problem, or, alternatively, to, restrict, its, civil, liberties, and, thus, risk, delegitimizing, its, claim, of, supporting, civil, liberties, for, this, reason, homegrown, terrorism, has, started, to, be, seen, as, a, greater, threat, as, stated, by, former, cia, director, michael, hayden, this, dilemma, some, social, theorists, would, conclude, may, very, well, play, into, the, initial, plans, of, the, acting, terrorist, s, namely, to, delegitimize, the, state, and, cause, a, systematic, shift, towards, anarchy, via, the, accumulation, of, negative, sentiments, towards, the, state, system, the, perpetrators, of, acts, of, terrorism, can, be, individuals, groups, or, states, according, to, some, definitions, clandestine, or, semi, clandestine, state, actors, may, carry, out, terrorist, acts, outside, the, framework, of, a, state, of, war, the, most, common, image, of, terrorism, is, that, it, is, carried, out, by, small, and, secretive, cells, highly, motivated, to, serve, a, particular, cause, and, many, of, the, most, deadly, operations, in, recent, times, such, as, the, september, 11, attacks, the, london, underground, bombing, 2008, mumbai, attacks, and, the, 2002, bali, bombings, were, planned, and, carried, out, by, a, close, clique, composed, of, close, friends, family, members, and, other, strong, social, networks, these, groups, benefited, from, the, free, flow, of, information, and, efficient, telecommunications, to, succeed, where, others, had, failed, over, the, years, much, research, has, been, conducted, to, distill, a, terrorist, profile, to, explain, these, individuals, actions, through, their, psychology, and, socio, economic, circumstances, some, specialists, highlight, the, lack, of, evidence, supporting, the, idea, that, terrorists, are, typically, psychologically, disturbed, the, careful, planning, and, detailed, execution, seen, in, many, terrorist, acts, are, not, characteristics, generally, associated, with, mentally, unstable, individuals, others, like, roderick, hindery, have, sought, to, discern, profiles, in, the, propaganda, tactics, used, by, terrorists, some, security, organizations, designate, these, groups, as, violent, non, state, actors, a, 2007, study, by, economist, alan, b, krueger, found, that, terrorists, were, less, likely, to, come, from, an, impoverished, background, 28, percent, versus, 33, percent, and, more, likely, to, have, at, least, a, high, school, education, 47, percent, versus, 38, percent, another, analysis, found, only, 16, percent, of, terrorists, came, from, impoverished, families, versus, 30, percent, of, male, palestinians, and, over, 60, percent, had, gone, beyond, high, school, versus, 15, percent, of, the, populace, to, avoid, detection, a, terrorist, will, look, dress, and, behave, normally, until, executing, the, assigned, mission, some, claim, that, attempts, to, profile, terrorists, based, on, personality, physical, or, sociological, traits, are, not, useful, the, physical, and, behavioral, description, of, the, terrorist, could, describe, almost, any, normal, person, the, majority, of, terrorist, attacks, are, carried, out, by, military, age, men, aged, 16, to, 40, groups, not, part, of, the, state, apparatus, of, in, opposition, to, the, state, are, most, commonly, referred, to, as, a, terrorist, in, the, media, according, to, the, global, terrorism, database, the, most, active, terrorist, group, in, the, period, 1970, to, 2010, was, shining, path, with, 4, 517, attacks, followed, by, farabundo, marti, national, liberation, front, fmln, irish, republican, army, ira, basque, fatherland, and, freedom, eta, revolutionary, armed, forces, of, colombia, farc, taliban, liberation, tigers, of, tamil, eelam, new, people, s, army, national, liberation, army, of, colombia, eln, and, kurdistan, workers, party, pkk, recent, decades, saw, the, emergence, of, hybrid, terrorist, organizations, which, typically, consist, of, both, military, and, political, arms, with, some, also, incorporating, a, third, element, focused, on, community, support, through, social, welfare, and, religious, services, known, as, dawah, in, islamic, rhetoric, this, evolution, necessitates, a, multidimensional, approach, to, warfare, where, states, must, engage, across, military, media, and, legal, fronts, to, challenge, the, legitimacy, of, these, organizations, state, sponsors, have, constituted, a, major, form, of, funding, for, example, palestine, liberation, organization, democratic, front, for, the, liberation, of, palestine, and, other, groups, sometimes, considered, to, be, terrorist, organizations, were, funded, by, the, soviet, union, iran, has, provided, funds, training, and, weapons, to, organizations, such, as, lebanese, shi, ite, group, hezbollah, the, yemenite, houthi, movement, and, palestinian, factions, such, as, hamas, and, islamic, jihad, iranian, funding, for, hamas, is, estimated, to, reach, several, hundred, million, dollars, annually, these, groups, and, others, have, played, significant, roles, in, iran, s, foreign, policy, and, served, as, proxies, in, conflicts, the, stern, gang, received, funding, from, italian, fascist, officers, in, beirut, to, undermine, the, british, authorities, in, palestine, revolutionary, tax, is, another, major, form, of, funding, and, essentially, a, euphemism, for, protection, money, revolutionary, taxes, play, a, secondary, role, as, one, other, means, of, intimidating, the, target, population, other, major, sources, of, funding, include, kidnapping, for, ransoms, smuggling, including, wildlife, smuggling, fraud, and, robbery, the, islamic, state, in, iraq, and, the, levant, has, reportedly, received, funding, via, private, donations, from, the, gulf, states, irish, republican, militants, primarily, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, and, the, irish, national, liberation, army, and, loyalist, paramilitaries, primarily, the, ulster, volunteer, force, and, ulster, defence, association, received, far, more, financing, from, criminal, and, legitimate, activities, within, the, british, isles, than, overseas,

governmental, body, whose, mandate, since, october, 2001, has, included, combating, terrorist, financing, terrorist, attacks, are, often, targeted, to, maximize, fear, and, publicity, most, frequently, using, explosives, terrorist, groups, usually, methodically, plan, attacks, in, advance, and, may, train, participants, plant, undercover, agents, and, raise, money, from, supporters, or, through, organized, crime, communications, occur, through, modern, telecommunications, or, through, old, fashioned, methods, such, as, couriers, there, is, concern, about, terrorist, attacks, employing, weapons, of, mass, destruction, some, academics, have, argued, that, while, it, is, often, assumed, terrorism, is, intended, to, spread, fear, this, is, not, necessarily, true, with, fear, instead, being, a, by, product, of, the, terrorist, s, actions, while, their, intentions, may, be, to, avenge, fallen, comrades, or, destroy, their, perceived, enemies, terrorism, is, a, form, of, asymmetric, warfare, and, is, more, common, when, direct, conventional, warfare, will, not, be, effective, because, opposing, forces, vary, greatly, in, power, yuval, harari, argues, that, the, peacefulness, of, modern, states, makes, them, paradoxically, more, vulnerable, to, terrorism, than, pre, modern, states, harari, argues, that, because, modern, states, have, committed, themselves, to, reducing, political, violence, to, almost, zero, terrorists, can, by, creating, political, violence, threaten, the, very, foundations, of, the, legitimacy, of, the, modern, state, this, is, in, contrast, to, pre, modern, states, where, violence, was, a, routine, and, recognised, aspect, of, politics, at, all, levels, making, political, violence, unremarkable, terrorism, thus, shocks, the, population, of, a, modern, state, far, more, than, a, pre, modern, one, and, consequently, the, state, is, forced, to, overreact, in, an, excessive, costly, and, spectacular, manner, which, is, often, what, the, terrorists, desire, the, type, of, people, terrorists, will, target, is, dependent, upon, the, ideology, of, the, terrorists, a, terrorist, s, ideology, will, create, a, class, of, legitimate, targets, who, are, deemed, as, its, enemies, and, who, are, permitted, to, be, targeted, this, ideology, will, also, allow, the, terrorists, to, place, the, blame, on, the, victim, who, is, viewed, as, being, responsible, for, the, violence, in, the, first, place, stabbing, attacks, a, historical, tactic, have, reemerged, as, a, prevalent, form, of, terrorism, in, the, 21st, century, notably, during, the, 2010s, and, 2020s, this, resurgence, originated, with, the, gia, in, the, 1990s, and, later, expanded, among, palestinian, terrorists, and, islamic, state, militants, the, trend, gained, momentum, with, a, wave, of, lone, wolf, terrorist, stabbing, attacks, by, palestinian, targeting, israelis, beginning, in, 2015, subsequently, this, pattern, extended, to, europe, during, the, surge, of, islamic, terrorism, in, the, 2010s, witnessing, at, least, 10, stabbing, attacks, allegedly, motivated, by, islamic, extremism, by, the, spring, of, 2017, with, france, experiencing, a, notable, concentration, of, such, incidents, terrorists, may, attempt, to, use, the, media, to, spread, their, message, or, manipulate, their, target, audience, shamil, basayev, used, this, tactic, during, the, budyonnovsk, hospital, hostage, crisis, and, again, in, the, moscow, theater, hostage, crisis, terrorists, may, also, target, national, symbols, for, attention, walter, lacquer, wrote, that, terrorism, was, always, to, a, large, extent, about, public, relations, and, propaganda, propaganda, by, deed, had, been, the, slogan, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, el, al, flight, 426, hijacking, is, considered, a, turning, point, for, modern, terrorism, studies, the, popular, front, for, the, liberation, of, palestine, pflp, realized, they, could, combine, the, tactics, of, targeting, national, symbols, and, civilians, in, this, case, as, hostages, to, generate, a, mass, media, spectacle, zehdi, labib, terzi, made, a, public, statement, about, this, in, 1976, the, first, several, hijackings, aroused, the, consciousness, of, the, world, and, awakened, the, media, and, world, opinion, much, more, and, more, effectively, than, 20, years, of, pleading, at, the, united, nations, mass, media, exposure, may, be, a, primary, goal, of, those, carrying, out, terrorism, to, expose, issues, that, would, otherwise, be, ignored, by, the, media, some, consider, this, to, be, manipulation, and, exploitation, of, the, media, the, internet, has, created, a, new, way, for, groups, to, spread, their, messages, this, has, created, a, cycle, of, measures, and, counter, measures, by, groups, in, support, of, and, in, opposition, to, terrorist, movements, the, united, nations, has, created, its, own, online, counterterrorism, resource, the, mass, media, will, on, occasion, censor, organizations, involved, in, terrorism, through, self, restraint, or, regulation, to, discourage, further, terrorism, this, may, encourage, organizations, to, perform, more, extreme, acts, of, terrorism, to, be, shown, in, the, mass, media, conversely, james, f, pastor, explains, the, significant, relationship, between, terrorism, and, the, media, and, the, underlying, benefit, each, receives, from, the, other, there, is, always, a, point, at, which, the, terrorist, ceases, to, manipulate, the, media, gestalt, a, point, at, which, the, violence, may, well, escalate, but, beyond, which, the, terrorist, has, become, symptomatic, of, the, media, gestalt, itself, terrorism, as, we, ordinarily, understand, it, is, innately, media, related, former, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, famously, spoke, of, the, close, connection, between, terrorism, and, the, media, calling, publicity, the, oxygen, of, terrorism, the, connection, between, terrorism, and, tourism, has, been, widely, studied, since, the, 1997, luxor, massacre, during, which, 62, people, including, 58, foreign, nationals, were, killed, by, islamist, group, al, jama, a, al, islamiyya, in, an, archaeological, site, in, egypt, in, the, 1970s, the, targets, of, terrorists, were, politicians, and, chiefs, of, police, while, now, international, tourists, and, visitors, are, selected, as, the, main, targets, of, attacks, the, attacks, on, the, world, trade, center, and, the, pentagon, on, september, 11, 2001, were, the, symbolic, center, which, marked, a, new, epoch, in, the, use, of, civil, transport, against, the, main, power, of, the, planet, from, this, event, onwards, the, spaces, of, leisure, that, characterized, the, pride, of, west, were, conceived, as, dangerous, and, frightful, responses, to, terrorism, are, broad, in, scope, they, can, include, re, alignments, of, the, political, spectrum, and, reassessments, of, fundamental, values, specific, types, of, responses, include, terrorism, research, also, called, terrorism, studies, or, terrorism, and, counter, terrorism, research, is, an, interdisciplinary, academic, field, which, seeks, to, understand, the, causes, of, terrorism, how, to, prevent, it, as, well, as, its, impact, in, the, broadest, sense, terrorism, research, can, be, carried, out, in, both, military, and, civilian, contexts, for, example, by, research, centres, such, as, the, british, centre, for, the, study, of, terrorism, and, political, violence, the, norwegian, centre, for, violence, and, traumatic, stress, studies, and, the, international, centre, for, counter, terrorism, icct, there, are, several, academic, journals, devoted, to, the, field, including, perspectives, on, terrorism, one, of, the, agreements, that, promote, the, international, legal, counterterrorist, framework, is, the, code, of, conduct, towards, achieving, a, world, free, of, terrorism, that, was, adopted, at, the, 73rd, session, of, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, 2018, the, code, of, conduct, was, initiated, by, kazakhstan, president, nursultan, nazarbayev, its, main, goal, is, to, implement, a, wide, range, of, international, commitments, to, counterterrorism, and, establish, a, broad, global, coalition, towards, achieving, a, world, free, of, terrorism, by, 2045, the, code, was, signed, by, more, than, 70, countries, according, to, a, report, by, dana, priest, and, william, m, arkin, in, the, washington, post, some, 1, 271, government, organizations, and, 1, 931, private, companies, work, on, programs, related, to, counterterrorism, homeland, security, and, intelligence, in, about, 10, 000, locations, across, the, united, states, america, s, thinking, on, how, to, defeat, radical, islamists, is, split, along, two, very, different, schools, of, thought, republicans, typically, follow, what, is, known, as, the, bush, doctrine, advocate, the, military, model, of, taking, the, fight, to, the, enemy, and, seeking, to, democratize, the, middle, east, democrats, by, contrast, generally, propose, the, law, enforcement, model, of, better, cooperation, with, nations, and, more, security, at, home, in, the, introduction, of, the, u, s, army, marine, corps, counterinsurgency, field, manual, sarah, sewall, states, the, need, for, u, s, forces, to, make, securing, the, civilian, rather, than,

enemies, new, insurgent, recruits, or, informants, and, erode, support, of, the, host, nation, sewall, sums, up, the, book, s, key, points, on, how, to, win, this, battle, sometimes, the, more, you, protect, your, force, the, less, secure, you, may, be, sometimes, the, more, force, is, used, the, less, effective, it, is, the, more, successful, the, counterinsurgency, is, the, less, force, can, be, used, and, the, more, risk, must, be, accepted, sometimes, doing, nothing, is, the, best, reaction, this, strategy, often, termed, courageous, restraint, has, certainly, led, to, some, success, on, the, middle, east, battlefield, however, it, does, not, address, the, fact, that, terrorists, are, mostly, homegrown, jones, and, libicki, 2008, created, a, list, of, all, the, terrorist, groups, they, could, find, that, were, active, between, 1968, and, 2006, they, found, 648, of, those, 136, splintered, and, 244, were, still, active, in, 2006, of, the, ones, that, ended, 43, converted, to, nonviolent, political, actions, like, the, irish, republican, army, in, northern, ireland, 40, were, defeated, by, law, enforcement, 7, 20, groups, were, defeated, by, military, force, and, 10, succeeded, 42, groups, became, large, enough, to, be, labeled, an, insurgency, 38, of, those, had, ended, by, 2006, of, those, 47, converted, to, nonviolent, political, actors, only, 5, were, ended, by, law, enforcement, and, 21, were, defeated, by, military, force, 26, won, jones, and, libicki, concluded, that, military, force, may, be, necessary, to, deal, with, large, insurgencies, but, are, only, occasionally, decisive, because, the, military, is, too, often, seen, as, a, bigger, threat, to, civilians, than, the, terrorists, to, avoid, that, the, rules, of, engagement, must, be, conscious, of, collateral, damage, and, work, to, minimize, it, another, researcher, audrey, cronin, lists, six, primary, ways, that, terrorist, groups, end, civilization, is, based, on, a, clearly, defined, and, widely, accepted, yet, often, unarticulated, hierarchy, violence, done, by, those, higher, on, the, hierarchy, to, those, lower, is, nearly, always, invisible, that, is, unnoticed, when, it, is, noticed, it, is, fully, rationalized, violence, done, by, those, lower, on, the, hierarchy, to, those, higher, is, unthinkable, and, when, it, does, occur, it, is, regarded, with, shock, horror, and, the, fetishization, of, the, victims, as, with, terrorism, the, concept, of, state, terrorism, is, controversial, the, chairman, of, the, united, nations, counter, terrorism, committee, has, stated, that, the, committee, was, conscious, of, 12, international, conventions, on, the, subject, and, none, of, them, referred, to, state, terrorism, which, was, not, an, international, legal, concept, if, states, abused, their, power, they, should, be, judged, against, international, conventions, dealing, with, war, crimes, international, human, rights, law, and, international, humanitarian, law, former, united, nations, secretary, general, kofi, annan, has, said, that, it, is, time, to, set, aside, debates, on, so, called, state, terrorism, the, use, of, force, by, states, is, already, thoroughly, regulated, under, international, law, he, made, clear, that, regardless, of, the, differences, between, governments, on, the, question, of, the, definition, of, terrorism, what, is, clear, and, what, we, can, all, agree, on, is, that, any, deliberate, attack, on, innocent, civilians, regardless, of, one, s, cause, is, unacceptable, and, fits, into, the, definition, of, terrorism, state, terrorism, has, been, used, to, refer, to, terrorist, acts, committed, by, governmental, agents, or, forces, this, involves, the, use, of, state, resources, employed, by, a, state, s, foreign, policies, such, as, using, its, military, to, directly, perform, acts, of, terrorism, professor, of, political, science, michael, stohl, cites, the, examples, that, include, the, german, bombing, of, london, the, japanese, surprise, attack, on, pearl, harbor, the, allied, firebombing, of, dresden, and, the, u, s, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, during, world, war, ii, he, argues, that, the, use, of, terror, tactics, is, common, in, international, relations, and, the, state, has, been, and, remains, a, more, likely, employer, of, terrorism, within, the, international, system, than, insurgents, he, cites, the, first, strike, option, as, an, example, of, the, terror, of, coercive, diplomacy, as, a, form, of, this, which, holds, the, world, hostage, with, the, implied, threat, of, using, nuclear, weapons, in, crisis, management, and, he, argues, that, the, institutionalized, form, of, terrorism, has, occurred, as, a, result, of, changes, that, took, place, following, world, war, ii, in, this, analysis, state, terrorism, exhibited, as, a, form, of, foreign, policy, was, shaped, by, the, presence, and, use, of, weapons, of, mass, destruction, and, the, legitimizing, of, such, violent, behavior, led, to, an, increasingly, accepted, form, of, this, behavior, by, the, state, charles, stewart, parnell, described, william, ewart, gladstone, s, irish, coercion, act, as, terrorism, in, his, no, rent, manifesto, in, 1881, during, the, irish, land, war, the, concept, is, used, to, describe, political, repressions, by, governments, against, their, own, civilian, populations, with, the, purpose, of, inciting, fear, for, example, taking, and, executing, civilian, hostages, or, extrajudicial, elimination, campaigns, are, commonly, considered, terror, or, terrorism, for, example, during, the, red, terror, or, the, great, terror, such, actions, are, often, described, as, democide, or, genocide, which, have, been, argued, to, be, equivalent, to, state, terrorism, empirical, studies, on, this, have, found, that, democracies, have, little, democide, western, democracies, including, the, united, states, have, supported, state, terrorism, and, mass, killings, with, some, examples, being, the, indonesian, mass, killings, of, 1965, 66, and, operation, condor, a, state, can, sponsor, terrorism, by, funding, or, harboring, a, terrorist, group, opinions, as, to, which, acts, of, violence, by, states, consist, of, state, sponsored, terrorism, vary, widely, when, states, provide, funding, for, groups, considered, by, some, to, be, terrorist, they, rarely, acknowledge, them, as, such, terrorism, is, a, charged, term, it, is, often, used, with, the, connotation, of, something, that, is, morally, wrong, governments, and, non, state, groups, use, the, term, to, abuse, or, denounce, opposing, groups, while, legislation, defining, terrorism, as, a, crime, has, been, adopted, in, many, states, the, distinction, between, activism, and, terrorism, remains, a, complex, and, debated, matter, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, whether, terrorism, should, be, regarded, as, a, war, crime, state, terrorism, is, that, perpetrated, by, nation, states, but, is, not, considered, such, by, the, state, conducting, it, making, legality, a, grey, area, the, term, terrorism, is, often, used, to, abuse, or, denounce, opposite, parties, either, governments, or, non, state, groups, an, example, of, this, is, the, terruqueo, political, attack, used, by, right, wing, groups, in, peru, to, target, leftist, groups, or, those, opposed, to, the, neoliberal, status, quo, likening, opponents, to, guerrilla, organizations, from, the, internal, conflict, in, peru, those, labeled, terrorists, by, their, opponents, rarely, identify, themselves, as, such, but, it, was, not, always, so, while, a, multitude, of, terms, like, separatist, freedom, fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, patriot, have, come, into, use, including, some, culturally, specific, terms, borrowed, from, other, languages, like, jihadi, mujahideen, and, fedayeen, the, unwillingness, to, self, identify, as, terrorists, began, when, parties, in, a, conflict, started, to, describe, each, other, as, terrorists, pejoratively, as, an, example, when, vera, zasulich, attacked, a, russian, official, known, for, abusing, prisoners, she, told, the, court, i, am, not, a, criminal, i, am, a, terrorist, the, stunned, court, acquitted, zazulich, when, they, realized, that, she, was, trying, to, become, a, martyr, she, was, carried, out, of, the, courtroom, on, the, shoulders, of, the, crowd, some, groups, and, individuals, have, openly, admitted, to, using, terrorist, tactics, even, while, maintaining, distance, from, the, pejorative, term, in, their, self, descriptions, the, zionist, militant, group, lohamei, herut, yisrael, admitted, that, they, used, terrorist, tactics, but, used, the, euphemism, freedom, fighters, to, describe, themselves, lohamei, herut, yisrael, means, freedom, fighters, for, israel, on, whether, particular, terrorist, acts, such, as, killing, non, combatants, can, be, justified, as, the, lesser, evil, in, a, particular, circumstance, philosophers, have, expressed, different, views, while, according, to, david, rodin, utilitarian, philosophers, can, in, theory, conceive, of, cases, in, which, the, evil, of, terrorism, is, outweighed, by, the, good, that, could, not, be, achieved, in, a, less, morally, costly, way, in, practice, the, harmful, effects, of, undermining, the, convention, of, non, combatant, immunity, is, thought, to, outweigh, the, goods, that, may, be, achieved, by, particular, acts, of, terrorism, among, the, non, utilitarian, philosophers, michael, walzer, argued, that, terrorism, can, be, morally, justified, in, only, one, specific, case, when, a, nation, or, community, faces, the, extreme, threat, of, complete, destruction, and, the, only, way, it, can, preserve, itself, is, by, intentionally, targeting, non, combatants, then, it, is, morally, entitled, to, do, so, in, his, book, inside, terrorism, bruce, hoffman, offered, an, explanation, of, why, the, term, terrorism, becomes, distorted, on, one, point, at, least, everyone, agrees, terrorism, is, a, pejorative, term, it, is, a, word, with, intrinsically, negative, connotations, that, is, generally, applied, to, one, s, enemies, and, opponents, or, to, those, with, whom, one, disagrees, and, would, otherwise, prefer, to, ignore, what, is, called, terrorism, brian, jenkins, has, written, thus, seems, to, depend, on, one, s, point, of, view, use, of, the, term, implies, a, moral, judgment, and, if, one, party, can, successfully, attach, the, label, terrorist, to, its, opponent, then, it, has, indirectly, persuaded, others, to, adopt, its, moral, viewpoint, hence, the, decision, to, call, someone, or, label, some, organization, terrorist, becomes, almost, unavoidably, subjective, depending, largely, on, whether, one, sympathizes, with, or, opposes, the, person, group, cause, concerned, if, one, identifies, with, the, victim, of, the, violence, for, example, then, the, act, is, terrorism, if, however, one, identifies, with, the, perpetrator, the, violent, act, is, regarded, in, a, more, sympathetic, if, not, positive, or, at, the, worst, an, ambivalent, light, and, it, is, not, terrorism, the, pejorative, connotations, of, the, word, can, be, summed, up, in, the, aphorism, one, man, s, terrorist, is, another, man, s, freedom, fighter, this, is, exemplified, when, a, group, using, irregular, military, methods, is, an, ally, of, a, state, against, a, mutual, enemy, but, later, falls, out, with, the, state, and, starts, to, use, those, methods, against, its, former, ally, during, the, second, world, war, the, malayan, people, s, anti, japanese, army, were, allied, with, the, british, but, during,
