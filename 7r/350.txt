transliteration, is, a, type, of, conversion, of, a, text, from, one, script, to, another, that, involves, swapping, letters, thus, trans, liter, in, predictable, ways, such, as, greek, a, cyrillic, d, greek, the, digraph, ch, armenian, n, or, latin, ae, for, instance, for, the, modern, greek, term, which, is, usually, translated, as, hellenic, republic, the, usual, transliteration, to, latin, script, is, ell, nik, d, mokratia, and, the, name, for, russia, in, cyrillic, script, is, usually, transliterated, as, rossiya, but, is, pronounced, exactly, the, same, way, as, transliteration, is, the, process, of, representing, or, intending, to, represent, a, word, phrase, or, text, in, a, different, script, or, writing, system, transliterations, are, designed, to, convey, the, pronunciation, of, the, original, word, in, a, different, script, allowing, readers, or, speakers, of, that, script, to, approximate, the, sounds, and, pronunciation, of, the, original, word, transliterations, do, not, change, the, pronunciation, of, the, word, thus, in, the, greek, above, example, is, transliterated, ll, though, it, is, pronounced, exactly, the, same, way, as, or, the, greek, letters, is, transliterated, d, though, pronounced, as, and, is, transliterated, though, it, is, pronounced, exactly, like, and, is, not, long, transliteration, does, not, alter, the, pronunciation, see, what, is, transliteration, how, is, it, different, from, translation, for, more, information, transcription, conversely, seeks, to, capture, sound, but, phonetically, approximate, it, into, the, new, script, corresponds, to, in, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, while, differentiation, is, lost, in, the, case, of, note, how, the, letter, shape, becomes, either, or, depending, on, the, vowel, that, follows, it, is, also, pronounced, slightly, differently, than, the, original, greek, pronunciation, as, it, is, a, phonetic, approximation, a, transcription, rather, than, a, transliteration, angle, brackets, may, be, used, to, set, off, transliteration, as, opposed, to, slashes, for, phonemic, transcription, and, square, brackets, for, phonetic, transcription, angle, brackets, may, also, be, used, to, set, off, characters, in, the, original, script, conventions, and, author, preferences, vary, systematic, transliteration, is, a, mapping, from, one, system, of, writing, into, another, typically, grapheme, to, grapheme, most, transliteration, systems, are, one, to, one, so, a, reader, who, knows, the, system, can, reconstruct, the, original, spelling, transliteration, which, adapts, written, form, without, altering, the, pronunciation, when, spoken, out, loud, is, opposed, to, letter, transcription, which, is, a, letter, by, letter, conversion, of, one, language, into, another, writing, system, still, most, systems, of, transliteration, map, the, letters, of, the, source, script, to, letters, pronounced, similarly, in, the, target, script, for, some, specific, pair, of, source, and, target, language, transliteration, which, adapts, written, form, without, altering, pronunciation, may, be, very, close, to, letter, by, letter, transcription, if, the, relations, between, letters, and, sounds, are, similar, in, both, languages, in, practice, there, are, some, mixed, transliteration, transcription, systems, that, transliterate, a, part, of, the, original, script, and, transcribe, the, rest, adapt, written, form, without, changing, pronunciation, however, use, mixed, scripts, such, as, scientific, transliteration, resulting, in, w, many, websites, recognize, transliteration, as, converting, the, written, form, to, a, different, script, without, altering, the, pronunciation, and, according, to, are, pronounced, let, it, be, and, sherlock, holmes, respectively, with, no, alterations, similarly, romanization, can, be, far, different, from, spoken, pronunciation, for, example, is, pronounced, far, closer, to, alfred, than, the, romanization, i, rf, l, id, suggests, it, is, important, to, note, that, letter, transcription, and, transliteration, are, not, the, same, thing, is, a, phonetic, approximation, of, alfred, when, pronounced, i, rf, l, id, and, a, transliteration, of, alfred, when, pronounced, exactly, the, same, as, alfred, the, chinese, wikipedia, has, the, definitions, right, with, 2, separate, articles, for, letter, transcription, alphabetical, transcription, and, transliteration, for, many, script, pairs, there, are, one, or, more, standard, transliteration, systems, however, unsystematic, transliteration, is, common, in, modern, greek, the, letters, and, the, letter, combinations, o, are, pronounced, except, when, pronounced, as, semivowels, and, a, modern, transcription, renders, them, all, as, i, but, a, transliteration, distinguishes, them, for, example, by, transliterating, to, i, y, and, ei, oi, yi, as, the, ancient, pronunciation, of, was, it, is, often, transliterated, as, an, i, with, a, macron, even, for, modern, texts, on, the, other, hand, is, sometimes, pronounced, and, sometimes, depending, on, the, following, sound, a, transcription, distinguishes, them, but, this, is, no, requirement, for, a, transliteration, that, renders, both, as, eu, the, initial, letter, h, reflecting, the, historical, rough, breathing, in, words, such, as, ell, nik, should, logically, be, omitted, in, transcription, from, koine, greek, on, and, from, transliteration, from, 1982, on, but, it, is, nonetheless, frequently, encountered, a, simple, example, of, difficulties, in, transliteration, is, the, arabic, letter, q, f, it, is, pronounced, in, literary, arabic, approximately, like, english, except, that, the, tongue, makes, contact, not, on, the, soft, palate, but, on, the, uvula, but, the, pronunciation, varies, between, different, dialects, of, arabic, the, letter, is, sometimes, transliterated, into, g, sometimes, into, q, or, for, in, egypt, it, is, silent, and, rarely, even, into, k, in, english, another, example, is, the, russian, letter, kha, it, is, pronounced, as, the, voiceless, velar, fricative, x, like, the, scottish, pronunciation, of, ch, in, lo, ch, this, sound, is, not, present, in, most, forms, of, english, and, is, often, transliterated, as, kh, as, in, nikita, khrushchev, many, languages, have, phonemic, sounds, such, as, click, consonants, which, are, quite, unlike, any, phoneme, in, the, language, into, which, they, are, being, transliterated, some, languages, and, scripts, present, particular, difficulties, to, transcribers, these, are, discussed, on, separate, pages
