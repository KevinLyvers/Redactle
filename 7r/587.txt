philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, is, a, scientific, journal, published, by, the, royal, society, in, its, earliest, days, it, was, a, private, venture, of, the, royal, society, s, secretary, it, was, established, in, 1665, making, it, the, second, journal, in, the, world, exclusively, devoted, to, science, after, the, journal, des, s, avans, and, therefore, also, the, world, s, longest, running, scientific, journal, it, became, an, official, society, publication, in, 1752, the, use, of, the, word, philosophical, in, the, title, refers, to, natural, philosophy, which, was, the, equivalent, of, what, would, now, be, generally, called, science, in, 1887, the, journal, expanded, and, divided, into, two, separate, publications, one, serving, the, physical, sciences, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, a, mathematical, physical, and, engineering, sciences, and, the, other, focusing, on, the, life, sciences, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, b, biological, sciences, both, journals, now, publish, themed, issues, and, issues, resulting, from, papers, presented, at, the, scientific, meetings, of, the, royal, society, primary, research, articles, are, published, in, the, sister, journals, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, biology, letters, journal, of, the, royal, society, interface, interface, focus, open, biology, and, royal, society, open, science, the, first, issue, published, in, london, on, 6, march, 1665, was, edited, and, published, by, the, royal, society, s, first, secretary, henry, oldenburg, four, and, a, half, years, after, the, society, was, founded, the, full, title, of, the, journal, as, given, by, oldenburg, was, philosophical, transactions, giving, some, accompt, of, the, present, undertakings, studies, and, labours, of, the, ingenious, in, many, considerable, parts, of, the, world, the, society, s, council, minutes, dated, 1, march, 1664, in, the, old, style, calendar, equivalent, to, 11, march, 1665, in, the, modern, new, style, calendar, ordered, that, the, philosophical, transactions, to, be, composed, by, mr, oldenburg, be, printed, the, first, monday, of, every, month, if, he, have, sufficient, matter, for, it, and, that, that, tract, be, licensed, by, the, council, of, this, society, being, first, revised, by, some, members, of, the, same, oldenburg, published, the, journal, at, his, own, personal, expense, and, seems, to, have, entered, into, an, agreement, with, the, society, s, council, allowing, him, to, keep, any, resulting, profits, he, was, to, be, disappointed, however, since, the, journal, performed, poorly, from, a, financial, point, of, view, during, his, lifetime, just, about, covering, the, rent, on, his, house, in, piccadilly, oldenburg, put, out, 136, issues, of, the, transactions, before, his, death, in, 1677, the, familiar, functions, of, the, scientific, journal, registration, date, stamping, and, provenance, certification, peer, review, dissemination, and, archiving, were, introduced, at, inception, by, philosophical, transactions, the, beginnings, of, these, ideas, can, be, traced, in, a, series, of, letters, from, oldenburg, to, robert, boyle, the, printed, journal, replaced, much, of, oldenburg, s, letter, writing, to, correspondents, at, least, on, scientific, matters, and, as, such, can, be, seen, as, a, labour, saving, device, oldenburg, also, described, his, journal, as, one, of, these, philosophical, commonplace, books, indicating, his, intention, to, produce, a, collective, notebook, between, scientists, over, the, years, the, form, of, the, contributions, to, the, journal, evolved, as, part, of, the, changing, expectations, for, persuasive, scientific, claims, and, the, changing, roles, of, scientists, with, respect, to, publication, issue, 1, contained, such, articles, as, an, account, of, the, improvement, of, optic, glasses, the, first, report, on, the, great, red, spot, of, jupiter, a, prediction, on, the, motion, of, a, recent, comet, probably, an, oort, cloud, object, a, review, of, robert, boyle, s, experimental, history, of, cold, robert, boyle, s, own, report, of, a, deformed, calf, a, report, of, a, peculiar, lead, ore, from, germany, and, the, use, thereof, of, an, hungarian, bolus, of, the, same, effect, with, the, bolus, armenus, of, the, new, american, whale, fishing, about, the, bermudas, and, a, narrative, concerning, the, success, of, pendulum, watches, at, sea, for, the, longitudes, the, final, article, of, the, issue, concerned, the, character, lately, published, beyond, the, seas, of, an, eminent, person, not, long, since, dead, at, tholouse, where, he, was, a, councellor, of, parliament, the, eminent, person, in, question, was, pierre, de, fermat, although, the, issue, failed, to, mention, his, last, theorem, in, the, first, year, of, the, journal, also, the, formula, for, determining, the, year, of, the, julian, period, given, its, character, involving, three, four, digit, numbers, was, published, by, jacques, de, billy, oldenburg, referred, to, himself, as, the, compiler, and, sometimes, author, of, the, transactions, and, always, claimed, that, the, journal, was, entirely, his, sole, enterprise, although, with, the, society, s, imprimatur, and, containing, reports, on, experiments, carried, out, and, initially, communicated, by, of, many, of, its, fellows, many, readers, saw, the, journal, as, an, official, organ, of, the, society, it, has, been, argued, that, oldenburg, benefitted, from, this, ambiguity, retaining, both, real, and, perceived, independence, giving, the, publication, an, air, of, authenticity, and, the, prospect, of, monetary, gain, while, simultaneously, enjoying, the, credibility, afforded, by, the, association, the, society, also, enjoyed, the, benefits, of, ambiguity, it, was, able, to, communicate, advances, in, natural, philosophy, undertaken, largely, in, its, own, name, without, the, worry, that, it, was, directly, responsible, for, its, content, in, the, aftermath, of, the, interregnum, the, potential, for, censorship, was, very, real, certainly, the, tone, of, the, early, volumes, was, set, by, oldenburg, who, often, related, things, he, was, told, by, his, contacts, translated, letters, and, manuscripts, from, other, languages, and, reviewed, books, always, being, sure, to, indicate, the, provenance, of, his, material, and, even, to, use, this, to, impress, the, reader, by, reporting, ongoing, and, often, unfinished, scientific, work, that, may, otherwise, have, not, been, reported, the, journal, had, a, central, function, of, being, a, scientific, news, service, at, the, time, of, philosophical, transactions, foundation, print, was, heavily, regulated, and, there, was, no, such, thing, as, a, free, press, in, fact, the, first, english, newspaper, the, london, gazette, which, was, an, official, organ, of, government, and, therefore, seen, as, sanitized, did, not, appear, until, after, philosophical, transactions, in, the, same, year, oldenburg, s, compulsive, letter, writing, to, foreign, correspondents, led, to, him, being, suspected, of, being, a, spy, for, the, dutch, and, interned, in, the, tower, of, london, in, 1667, a, rival, took, the, opportunity, to, publish, a, pirate, issue, of, philosophical, transactions, with, the, pretense, of, it, being, issue, 27, oldenburg, repudiated, the, issue, by, publishing, the, real, 27, upon, his, release, upon, oldenburg, s, death, following, a, brief, hiatus, the, position, of, editor, was, passed, down, through, successive, secretaries, of, the, society, as, an, unofficial, responsibility, and, at, their, own, expense, robert, hooke, changed, the, name, of, the, journal, to, philosophical, collections, in, 1679, a, name, that, remained, until, 1682, when, it, changed, back, the, position, of, editor, was, sometimes, held, jointly, and, included, william, musgrave, nos, 167, to, 178, and, robert, plot, nos, 144, to, 178, by, the, mid, eighteenth, century, the, most, notable, editors, besides, oldenburg, were, hans, sloane, james, jurin, and, cromwell, mortimer, in, virtually, all, cases, the, journal, was, edited, by, the, serving, secretary, of, the, society, and, occasionally, by, both, secretaries, working, in, tandem, these, editor, secretaries, carried, the, financial, burden, of, publishing, the, philosophical, transactions, by, the, early, 1750s, the, philosophical, transactions, had, come, under, attack, most, prominently, by, john, hill, an, actor, apothecary, and, naturalist, hill, published, three, works, in, two, years, ridiculing, the, royal, society, and, the, philosophical, transactions, the, society, was, quick, to, point, out, that, it, was, not, officially, responsible, for, the, journal, yet, in, 1752, the, society, took, over, the, philosophical, transactions, the, journal, would, henceforth, be, published, for, the, sole, use, and, benefit, of, this, society, it, would, be, financially, carried, by, the, members, subscriptions, and, it, would, be, edited, by, the, committee, of, papers, after, the, takeover, of, the, journal, by, the, royal, society, management, decisions, including, negotiating, with, printers, and, booksellers, were, still, the, task, of, one, of, the, secretaries, but, editorial, control, was, exercised, through, the, committee, of, papers, the, committee, mostly, based, its, judgements, on, which, papers, to, publish, and, which, to, decline, on, the, 300, to, 500, word, abstracts, of, papers, read, during, its, weekly, meetings, but, the, members, could, if, they, desired, consult, the, original, paper, in, full, once, the, decision, to, print, had, been, taken, the, paper, appeared, in, the, volume, for, that, year, it, would, feature, the, author, s, name, the, name, of, the, fellow, who, had, communicated, the, paper, to, the, society, and, the, date, on, which, it, was, read, the, royal, society, covered, paper, engraving, and, printing, costs, the, society, found, the, journal, to, be, a, money, losing, proposition, it, cost, on, average, upwards, of, 300, annually, to, produce, of, which, they, seldom, recouped, more, than, 150, because, two, fifths, of, the, copies, were, distributed, for, free, to, the, journal, s, natural, market, sales, were, generally, slow, and, although, back, issues, sold, out, gradually, it, would, usually, be, ten, years, or, more, before, there, were, fewer, than, 100, left, of, any, given, print, run, during, the, presidency, of, joseph, banks, the, work, of, the, committee, of, papers, continued, fairly, efficiently, with, the, president, himself, in, frequent, attendance, there, was, a, number, of, ways, in, which, the, president, and, secretaries, could, bypass, or, subvert, the, royal, society, s, publishing, procedures, papers, could, be, prevented, from, reaching, the, committee, by, not, allowing, them, to, be, read, in, the, first, place, also, though, papers, were, rarely, subjected, to, formal, review, there, is, evidence, of, editorial, intervention, with, banks, himself, or, a, trusted, deputy, proposing, cuts, or, emendations, to, particular, contributions, publishing, in, the, philosophical, transactions, carried, a, high, degree, of, prestige, and, banks, himself, attributed, an, attempt, to, unseat, him, relatively, early, in, his, presidency, to, the, envy, of, authors, whose, papers, had, been, rejected, from, the, journal, transactions, continued, steadily, through, the, turn, of, the, century, and, into, the, 1820s, in, the, late, 1820s, and, early, 1830s, a, movement, to, reform, the, royal, society, rose, the, reformers, felt, that, the, scientific, character, of, the, society, had, been, undermined, by, the, admission, of, too, many, gentleman, dilettantes, under, banks, in, proposing, a, more, limited, membership, to, protect, the, society, s, reputation, they, also, argued, for, systematic, expert, evaluation, of, papers, for, transactions, by, named, referees, sectional, committees, each, with, responsibility, for, a, particular, group, of, disciplines, were, initially, set, up, in, the, 1830s, to, adjudicate, the, award, of, george, iv, s, royal, medals, but, individual, members, of, these, committees, were, soon, put, to, work, reporting, on, and, evaluating, papers, submitted, to, the, royal, society, these, evaluations, began, to, be, used, as, the, basis, of, recommendations, to, the, committee, of, papers, who, would, then, rubber, stamp, decisions, made, by, the, sectional, committees, despite, its, flaws, it, was, inconsistent, in, its, application, and, not, free, of, abuses, this, system, remained, at, the, heart, of, the, society, s, procedures, for, publishing, until, 1847, when, the, sectional, committees, were, dissolved, however, the, practice, of, sending, most, papers, out, for, review, remained, during, the, 1850s, the, cost, of, the, transactions, to, the, society, was, increasing, again, and, would, keep, doing, so, for, the, rest, of, the, century, illustrations, were, always, the, largest, expense, illustrations, had, been, a, natural, and, essential, aspect, of, the, scientific, periodical, since, the, later, seventeenth, century, engravings, cut, into, metal, plates, were, used, for, detailed, illustrations, particularly, where, realism, was, required, while, wood, cuts, and, from, the, early, nineteenth, century, wood, engravings, were, used, for, diagrams, as, they, could, be, easily, combined, with, letterpress, by, the, mid, 1850s, the, philosophical, transactions, was, seen, as, a, drain, on, the, society, s, finances, and, the, treasurer, edward, sabine, urged, the, committee, of, papers, to, restrict, the, length, and, number, of, papers, published, in, the, journal, in, 1852, for, example, the, amount, expended, on, the, transactions, was, 1094, but, only, 276, of, this, was, offset, by, sales, income, sabine, felt, this, was, more, than, the, society, could, comfortably, sustain, the, print, run, of, the, journal, was, 1000, copies, around, 500, of, these, went, to, the, fellowship, in, return, for, their, membership, dues, and, since, authors, now, received, up, to, 150, off, prints, for, free, to, circulate, through, their, personal, networks, the, demand, for, the, transactions, through, the, book, trade, must, have, been, limited, the, concerns, with, cost, eventually, led, to, a, change, in, the, printer, in, 1877, from, taylor, francis, to, harrison, sons, the, latter, was, a, larger, commercial, printer, able, to, offer, the, society, a, more, financially, viable, contract, although, it, was, less, experienced, in, printing, scientific, works, while, expenditure, was, a, worry, for, the, treasurer, as, secretary, from, 1854, george, gabriel, stokes, was, preoccupied, with, the, actual, content, of, the, transactions, and, his, extensive, correspondence, with, authors, over, his, thirty, one, year, term, he, took, up, most, of, his, time, beyond, his, duties, as, lucasian, professor, at, cambridge, stokes, was, paramount, in, establishing, a, more, formalized, refereeing, process, at, the, royal, society, it, was, not, until, stokes, presidency, ended, in, 1890, that, his, influence, over, the, journal, diminished, the, introduction, of, fixed, terms, for, society, officers, precluded, subsequent, editors, from, taking, on, stokes, mantle, and, meant, that, the, society, operated, its, editorial, practices, more, collectively, than, it, had, done, since, the, mechanisms, for, it, were, established, in, 1752, by, the, mid, nineteenth, century, getting, a, paper, published, in, the, transactions, still, relied, on, the, paper, first, being, read, by, a, fellow, many, papers, were, sent, immediately, for, printing, in, abstract, form, in, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, but, those, which, were, being, considered, for, printing, in, full, in, transactions, were, usually, sent, to, two, referees, for, comment, before, the, final, decision, was, made, by, the, committee, of, papers, during, stokes, time, authors, were, given, the, opportunity, to, discuss, their, paper, at, length, with, him, before, during, and, after, its, official, submission, to, the, committee, of, papers, in, 1887, the, transactions, split, into, series, a, and, b, dealing, with, the, physical, and, biological, sciences, respectively, in, 1897, the, model, of, collective, responsibility, for, the, editing, of, the, transactions, was, emphasized, by, the, re, establishment, of, the, sectional, committees, the, six, sectional, committees, covered, mathematics, botany, zoology, physiology, geology, and, together, chemistry, and, physics, and, were, composed, of, fellows, of, the, society, with, relevant, expertise, the, sectional, committees, took, on, the, task, of, managing, the, refereeing, process, after, papers, had, been, read, before, the, society, referees, were, usually, fellows, except, in, a, small, number, of, cases, where, the, topic, was, beyond, the, knowledge, of, the, fellowship, or, at, least, of, those, willing, to, referee, the, sectional, committees, communicated, referee, reports, to, authors, and, sent, reports, to, the, committee, of, papers, for, final, sanction, the, sectional, committees, were, intended, to, reduce, the, burden, on, the, secretaries, and, council, consequently, the, secretary, in, the, 1890s, arthur, rucker, no, longer, coordinated, the, refereeing, of, papers, nor, did, he, generally, correspond, extensively, with, authors, about, their, papers, as, stokes, had, done, however, he, continued, to, be, the, first, port, of, call, for, authors, submitting, papers, authors, were, increasingly, expected, to, submit, manuscripts, in, a, standardized, format, and, style, from, 1896, they, were, encouraged, to, submit, typed, papers, on, foolscap, folio, sized, paper, to, lighten, the, work, of, getting, papers, ready, for, printing, and, to, reduce, the, chance, of, error, in, the, process, a, publishable, paper, now, had, to, present, its, information, in, an, appropriate, manner, as, well, as, being, of, remarkable, scientific, interest, for, a, brief, period, between, 1907, and, 1914, authors, were, under, even, more, pressure, to, conform, to, the, society, s, expectations, due, to, a, decision, to, discuss, cost, estimates, of, candidate, papers, alongside, referees, reports, the, committees, could, require, authors, to, reduce, the, number, of, illustrations, or, tables, or, indeed, the, overall, length, of, the, paper, as, a, condition, of, acceptance, it, was, hoped, that, this, policy, would, reduce, the, still, rising, costs, of, production, which, had, reached, 1747, in, 1906, but, the, effect, appears, to, have, been, negligible, and, the, cost, estimates, ceased, to, be, routine, practice, after, 1914, it, was, only, after, the, second, world, war, that, the, society, s, concerns, about, the, cost, of, its, journals, were, finally, allayed, there, had, been, a, one, off, surplus, in, 1932, but, it, was, only, from, 1948, that, the, transactions, began, regularly, to, end, the, year, in, surplus, that, year, despite, a, three, fold, increase, in, production, costs, it, was, a, bumper, year, for, papers, there, was, a, surplus, of, almost, 400, part, of, the, post, war, financial, success, of, the, transactions, was, due, to, the, rising, subscriptions, received, and, a, growing, number, of, subscriptions, from, british, and, international, institutions, including, universities, industry, and, government, this, was, at, the, same, time, as, private, subscriptions, outside, of, fellows, were, non, existent, by, the, early, 1970s, institutional, subscription, was, the, main, channel, of, income, from, publication, sales, for, the, society, from, 1970, to, 1971, 43, 760, copies, of, transactions, were, sold, of, which, casual, purchasers, accounted, for, only, 2070, copies, all, of, the, society, s, publications, now, had, a, substantial, international, circulation, in, 1973, for, example, just, 11, of, institutional, subscriptions, were, from, the, united, kingdom, 50, were, from, the, united, states, contributions, however, were, still, mostly, from, british, authors, 69, of, royal, society, authors, were, from, the, united, kingdom, in, 1974, a, publications, policy, committee, suggested, that, more, overseas, scientists, could, be, encouraged, to, submit, papers, if, the, requirement, to, have, papers, communicated, by, fellows, was, dropped, this, did, not, happen, until, 1990, there, was, also, a, suggestion, to, create, a, c, journal, for, molecular, sciences, to, attract, more, authors, in, that, area, but, the, idea, never, materialized, the, conclusion, in, 1973, was, a, general, appeal, to, encourage, more, british, scientists, whether, fellows, or, not, to, publish, papers, with, the, society, and, to, pass, on, the, message, to, their, overseas, colleagues, by, the, early, 2000s, the, proportion, of, non, uk, authors, had, risen, to, around, a, half, and, by, 2017, it, had, passed, 80, as, the, twentieth, century, came, to, a, close, the, editing, of, the, transactions, and, the, society, s, other, journals, became, more, professional, with, the, employment, of, a, growing, in, house, staff, of, editors, designers, and, marketers, in, 1968, there, were, about, eleven, staff, in, the, publishing, section, by, 1990, the, number, had, risen, to, twenty, two, the, editorial, processes, were, also, transformed, in, 1968, the, sectional, committees, had, been, abolished, again, instead, the, secretaries, harrie, massey, physicist, and, bernard, katz, physiologist, were, each, assigned, a, group, of, fellows, to, act, as, associate, editors, for, each, series, a, and, b, of, the, transactions, the, role, of, the, committee, of, papers, was, abolished, in, 1989, and, since, 1990, two, fellows, rather, than, the, secretaries, have, acted, as, the, editors, with, assistance, from, associate, editors, the, editors, serve, on, the, publishing, board, established, in, 1997, to, monitor, publishing, and, report, to, the, council, in, the, 1990s, as, these, changes, to, the, publishing, and, editorial, teams, were, implemented, the, publishing, section, acquired, its, first, computer, for, administration, the, transactions, were, first, published, online, in, 1997, over, the, centuries, many, important, scientific, discoveries, have, been, published, in, the, philosophical, transactions, famous, contributing, authors, include, in, july, 2011, programmer, greg, maxwell, released, through, the, pirate, bay, the, nearly, 19, 000, articles, that, had, been, published, before, 1923, and, were, therefore, in, the, public, domain, in, the, united, states, to, support, aaron, swartz, in, his, case, the, articles, had, been, digitized, for, the, royal, society, by, jstor, for, a, cost, of, less, than, us, 100, 000, and, public, access, to, them, was, restricted, through, a, paywall, in, august, 2011, users, uploaded, over, 18, 500, articles, to, the, collections, of, the, internet, archive, the, collection, received, 50, 000, views, per, month, by, november, 2011, in, october, of, the, same, year, the, royal, society, released, for, free, the, full, text, of, all, its, articles, prior, to, 1941, but, denied, that, this, decision, had, been, influenced, by, maxwell, s, actions, in, 2017, the, royal, society, launched, a, completely, re, digitised, version, of, the, complete, journal, archive, back, to, 1665, in, high, resolution, and, with, enhanced, metadata, all, the, out, of, copyright, material, is, completely, free, to, access, without, a, login, the, protagonist, of, nathaniel, hawthorne, s, the, birthmark, alludes, to, the, older, editions, of, the, philosophical, transactions, comparing, them, to, the, occult, writings, of, earlier, natural, philosophers, hardly, less, curious, and, imaginative, were, the, early, volumes, of, the, transactions, of, the, royal, society, in, which, the, members, knowing, little, of, the, limits, of, natural, possibility, were, continually, recording, wonders, or, proposing, methods, whereby, wonders, might, be, wrought, the, journal, is, also, mentioned, by, the, narrator, in, chapter, 6, of, the, time, machine, by, h, g, wells, had, i, been, a, literary, man, i, might, perhaps, have, moralised, upon, the, futility, of, all, ambition, but, as, it, was, the, thing, that, struck, me, with, keenest, force, was, the, enormous, waste, of, labour, to, which, this, sombre, wilderness, of, rotting, paper, testified, at, the, time, i, will, confess, that, i, thought, chiefly, of, the, philosophical, transactions, and, my, own, seventeen, papers, upon, physical, optics
