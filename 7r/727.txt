trust, is, the, belief, that, another, person, will, do, what, is, expected, it, brings, with, it, a, willingness, for, one, party, the, trustor, to, become, vulnerable, to, another, party, the, trustee, on, the, presumption, that, the, trustee, will, act, in, ways, that, benefit, the, trustor, in, addition, the, trustor, does, not, have, control, over, the, actions, of, the, trustee, scholars, distinguish, between, generalized, trust, also, known, as, social, trust, which, is, the, extension, of, trust, to, a, relatively, large, circle, of, unfamiliar, others, and, particularized, trust, which, is, contingent, on, a, specific, situation, or, a, specific, relationship, as, the, trustor, is, uncertain, about, the, outcome, of, the, trustee, s, actions, the, trustor, can, only, develop, and, evaluate, expectations, such, expectations, are, formed, with, a, view, to, the, motivations, of, the, trustee, dependent, on, their, characteristics, the, situation, and, their, interaction, the, uncertainty, stems, from, the, risk, of, failure, or, harm, to, the, trustor, if, the, trustee, does, not, behave, as, desired, in, the, social, sciences, the, subtleties, of, trust, are, a, subject, of, ongoing, research, in, sociology, and, psychology, the, degree, to, which, one, party, trusts, another, is, a, measure, of, belief, in, the, honesty, fairness, or, benevolence, of, another, party, the, term, confidence, is, more, appropriate, for, a, belief, in, the, competence, of, the, other, party, a, failure, in, trust, may, be, forgiven, more, easily, if, it, is, interpreted, as, a, failure, of, competence, rather, than, a, lack, of, benevolence, or, honesty, in, economics, trust, is, often, conceptualized, as, reliability, in, transactions, in, all, cases, trust, is, a, heuristic, decision, rule, allowing, a, person, to, deal, with, complexities, that, would, require, unrealistic, effort, in, rational, reasoning, types, of, trust, identified, in, academic, literature, include, contractual, trust, competence, trust, and, goodwill, trust, american, lawyer, charles, fried, speaks, of, contractual, trust, as, a, humdrum, experience, based, on, the, voluntary, acceptance, of, contractual, obligations, for, example, people, keep, appointments, and, undertake, commercial, transactions, competence, trust, can, be, defined, as, a, belief, in, the, other, s, ability, to, do, the, job, or, complete, a, task, this, term, is, applied, for, example, in, relation, to, cultural, competence, in, healthcare, in, working, relationships, goodwill, trust, has, been, described, as, trust, regarding, the, benevolence, and, integrity, of, counterpart, four, types, of, social, trust, are, recognized, sociology, claims, trust, is, one, of, several, social, constructs, an, element, of, the, social, reality, other, constructs, frequently, discussed, together, with, trust, include, control, confidence, risk, meaning, and, power, trust, is, attributable, to, relationships, between, social, actors, both, individuals, and, groups, social, systems, sociology, is, concerned, with, the, position, and, role, of, trust, in, social, systems, interest, in, trust, has, grown, significantly, since, the, early, 1980s, from, the, early, works, of, luhmann, barber, and, giddens, see, sztompka, for, a, more, detailed, overview, this, growth, of, interest, in, trust, has, been, stimulated, by, ongoing, changes, in, society, known, as, late, modernity, and, post, modernity, sviatoslav, contended, that, society, needs, trust, because, it, increasingly, finds, itself, operating, at, the, edge, between, confidence, in, what, is, known, from, everyday, experience, and, contingency, of, new, possibilities, without, trust, one, should, always, consider, all, contingent, possibilities, leading, to, paralysis, by, analysis, trust, acts, as, a, decisional, heuristic, allowing, the, decision, maker, to, overcome, bounded, rationality, and, process, what, would, otherwise, be, an, excessively, complex, situation, trust, can, be, seen, as, a, bet, on, one, of, many, contingent, futures, specifically, the, one, that, appears, to, deliver, the, greatest, benefits, once, the, bet, is, decided, i, e, trust, is, granted, the, trustor, suspends, his, or, her, disbelief, and, the, possibility, of, a, negative, course, of, action, is, not, considered, at, all, hence, trust, acts, as, a, reducing, agent, of, social, complexity, allowing, for, cooperation, sociology, tends, to, focus, on, two, distinct, views, the, macro, view, of, social, systems, and, a, micro, view, of, individual, social, actors, where, it, borders, with, social, psychology, views, on, trust, follow, this, dichotomy, on, one, side, the, systemic, role, of, trust, can, be, discussed, with, a, certain, disregard, to, the, psychological, complexity, underpinning, individual, trust, the, behavioral, approach, to, trust, is, usually, assumed, while, actions, of, social, actors, are, measurable, allowing, for, statistical, modelling, of, trust, this, systemic, approach, can, be, contrasted, with, studies, on, social, actors, and, their, decision, making, process, in, anticipation, that, understanding, of, such, a, process, will, explain, and, allow, to, model, the, emergence, of, trust, sociology, acknowledges, that, the, contingency, of, the, future, creates, a, dependency, between, social, actors, and, specifically, that, the, trustor, becomes, dependent, on, the, trustee, trust, is, seen, as, one, of, the, possible, methods, to, resolve, such, a, dependency, being, an, attractive, alternative, to, control, trust, is, valuable, if, the, trustee, is, much, more, powerful, than, the, trustor, yet, the, trustor, is, under, social, obligation, to, support, the, trustee, modern, information, technologies, have, not, only, facilitated, the, transition, to, a, post, modern, society, but, have, also, challenged, traditional, views, on, trust, information, systems, research, has, identified, that, people, have, come, to, trust, in, technology, via, two, primary, constructs, the, first, consists, of, human, like, constructs, including, benevolence, honesty, and, competence, whilst, the, second, employs, system, like, constructs, such, as, usefulness, reliability, and, functionality, the, discussion, surrounding, the, relationship, between, information, technologies, and, trust, is, still, in, progress, as, research, remains, in, its, infant, stages, several, dozen, studies, have, examined, the, impact, of, ethnic, diversity, on, social, trust, research, published, in, the, annual, review, of, political, science, concluded, that, there, were, three, key, debates, on, the, subject, the, review, s, meta, analysis, of, 87, studies, showed, a, consistent, though, modest, negative, relationship, between, ethnic, diversity, and, social, trust, ethnic, diversity, has, the, strongest, negative, impact, on, neighbor, trust, in, group, trust, and, generalized, trust, it, did, not, appear, to, have, a, significant, impact, on, out, group, trust, the, authors, present, a, warning, about, the, modest, size, of, the, effect, stating, however, the, rather, modest, size, of, the, implies, that, apocalyptic, claims, regarding, the, severe, threat, of, ethnic, diversity, for, social, trust, in, contemporary, societies, are, exaggerated, in, psychology, trust, is, believing, that, the, trusted, person, will, do, what, is, expected, according, to, the, psychoanalyst, erik, erikson, development, of, basic, trust, is, the, first, state, of, psychosocial, development, occurring, or, failing, during, the, first, two, years, of, life, success, results, in, feelings, of, security, and, optimism, while, failure, leads, towards, an, orientation, of, insecurity, and, mistrust, possibly, resulting, in, attachment, disorders, a, person, s, dispositional, tendency, to, trust, others, can, be, considered, a, personality, trait, and, as, such, is, one, of, the, strongest, predictors, of, subjective, well, being, trust, increases, subjective, well, being, because, it, enhances, the, quality, of, one, s, interpersonal, relationships, happy, people, are, skilled, at, fostering, good, relationships, trust, is, integral, to, the, idea, of, social, influence, it, is, easier, to, influence, or, persuade, someone, who, is, trusting, the, notion, of, trust, is, increasingly, adopted, to, predict, acceptance, of, behaviors, by, others, institutions, e, g, government, agencies, and, objects, such, as, machines, yet, once, again, perceptions, of, honesty, competence, and, value, similarity, slightly, similar, to, benevolence, are, essential, there, are, three, forms, of, trust, commonly, studied, in, psychology, once, trust, is, lost, by, violation, of, one, of, these, three, determinants, it, is, very, hard, to, regain, there, is, asymmetry, in, the, building, versus, destruction, of, trust, research, has, been, conducted, into, the, social, implications, of, trust, for, instance, despite, the, centrality, of, trust, to, the, positive, functioning, of, people, and, relationships, very, little, is, known, about, how, and, why, trust, evolves, is, maintained, and, is, destroyed, one, factor, that, enhances, trust, among, people, is, facial, resemblance, experimenters, who, digitally, manipulated, facial, resemblance, in, a, two, person, sequential, trust, game, found, evidence, that, people, have, more, trust, in, a, partner, who, has, similar, facial, features, facial, resemblance, also, decreased, sexual, desire, for, a, partner, in, a, series, of, tests, digitally, manipulated, faces, were, presented, to, subjects, who, evaluated, them, for, attractiveness, within, a, long, term, or, short, term, relationship, the, results, showed, that, within, the, context, of, a, short, term, relationship, dependent, on, sexual, desire, similar, facial, features, caused, a, decrease, in, desire, within, the, context, of, a, long, term, relationship, which, is, dependent, on, trust, similar, facial, features, increased, a, person, s, attractiveness, this, suggests, that, facial, resemblance, and, trust, have, great, effects, on, relationships, interpersonal, trust, literature, investigates, trust, diagnostic, situations, situations, that, test, partners, abilities, to, act, in, the, best, interests, of, the, other, person, or, the, relationship, while, rejecting, a, conflicting, option, which, is, merely, in, their, self, interest, trust, diagnostic, situations, occur, throughout, everyday, life, though, they, can, also, be, deliberately, engineered, by, people, who, want, to, test, the, current, level, of, trust, in, a, relationship, a, low, trust, relationship, is, one, in, which, a, person, has, little, confidence, their, partner, is, truly, concerned, about, them, or, the, relationship, people, in, low, trust, relationships, tend, to, make, distress, maintaining, attributions, whereby, they, place, their, greatest, focus, on, the, consequences, of, their, partner, s, negative, behavior, and, any, impacts, of, positive, actions, are, minimized, this, feeds, into, the, overarching, notion, that, the, person, s, partner, is, uninterested, in, the, relationship, and, any, positive, acts, on, their, part, are, met, with, skepticism, leading, to, further, negative, outcomes, distrusting, people, may, miss, opportunities, for, trusting, relationships, someone, subject, to, an, abusive, childhood, may, have, been, deprived, of, any, evidence, that, trust, is, warranted, in, future, relationships, an, important, key, to, treating, sexual, victimization, of, a, child, is, the, rebuilding, of, trust, between, parent, and, child, failure, by, adults, to, validate, that, sexual, abuse, occurred, contributes, to, the, child, s, difficulty, in, trusting, self, and, others, a, child, s, trust, can, also, be, affected, by, the, erosion, of, the, marriage, of, their, parents, children, of, divorce, do, not, exhibit, less, trust, in, mothers, partners, spouses, friends, and, associates, than, their, peers, of, intact, families, the, impact, of, parental, divorce, is, limited, to, trust, in, the, father, people, may, trust, non, human, agents, for, instance, people, may, trust, animals, the, scientific, process, and, social, machines, trust, helps, create, a, social, contract, that, allows, humans, and, domestic, animals, to, live, together, trust, in, the, scientific, process, is, associated, with, increased, trust, in, innovations, such, as, biotechnology, when, it, comes, to, trust, in, social, machines, people, are, more, willing, to, trust, intelligent, machines, with, humanoid, morphologies, and, female, cues, when, they, are, focused, on, tasks, versus, socialization, and, when, they, behave, morally, well, more, generally, they, may, be, trusted, as, a, function, of, the, machine, heuristic, a, mental, shortcut, with, which, people, assume, that, machines, are, less, biased, more, accurate, and, more, reliable, than, people, such, that, people, may, sometimes, trust, a, robot, more, than, a, person, people, are, disposed, to, trust, and, to, judge, the, trustworthiness, of, other, people, or, groups, for, instance, in, developing, relationships, with, potential, mentors, one, example, would, be, as, part, of, interprofessional, work, in, the, referral, pathway, from, an, emergency, department, to, a, hospital, ward, another, would, be, building, knowledge, on, whether, new, practices, people, and, things, introduced, into, our, lives, are, indeed, accountable, or, worthy, of, investing, confidence, and, trust, in, this, process, is, captured, by, the, empirically, grounded, construct, of, relational, integration, within, normalization, process, theory, this, can, be, traced, in, neuroscience, terms, to, the, neurobiological, structure, and, activity, of, a, human, brain, some, studies, indicate, that, trust, can, be, altered, by, the, application, of, oxytocin, the, social, identity, approach, explains, a, person, s, trust, in, strangers, as, a, function, of, their, group, based, stereotypes, or, in, group, favoring, behaviors, which, they, base, on, salient, group, memberships, with, regard, to, ingroup, favoritism, people, generally, think, well, of, strangers, but, expect, better, treatment, from, in, group, members, in, comparison, to, out, group, members, this, greater, expectation, translates, into, a, propensity, to, trust, a, member, of, the, in, group, more, than, a, member, of, the, out, group, it, is, only, advantageous, for, one, to, form, such, expectations, of, an, in, group, stranger, if, the, stranger, also, knows, one, s, own, group, membership, the, social, identity, approach, has, been, empirically, investigated, researchers, have, employed, allocator, studies, to, understand, group, based, trust, in, strangers, they, may, be, operationalized, as, unilateral, or, bilateral, relationships, of, exchange, general, social, categories, such, as, university, affiliation, course, majors, and, even, ad, hoc, groups, have, been, used, to, distinguish, between, in, group, and, out, group, members, in, unilateral, studies, of, trust, the, participant, is, asked, to, choose, between, envelopes, containing, money, that, an, in, group, or, out, group, member, previously, allocated, participants, have, no, prior, or, future, opportunities, for, interaction, thereby, testing, brewer, s, notion, that, group, membership, is, sufficient, to, bring, about, group, based, trust, and, hence, cooperation, participants, could, expect, an, amount, ranging, from, nothing, to, the, maximum, value, an, allocator, could, give, out, bilateral, studies, of, trust, have, employed, an, investment, game, devised, by, berg, and, colleagues, in, which, people, choose, to, give, a, portion, or, none, of, their, money, to, another, any, amount, given, would, be, tripled, and, the, receiver, would, then, decide, whether, they, would, return, the, favor, by, giving, money, back, to, the, sender, this, was, meant, to, test, trusting, behavior, on, the, sender, s, part, and, the, receiver, s, eventual, trustworthiness, empirical, research, demonstrates, that, when, group, membership, is, salient, to, both, parties, trust, is, granted, more, readily, to, in, group, members, than, out, group, members, this, occurs, even, when, the, in, group, s, stereotype, was, comparatively, less, positive, than, the, out, group, s, e, g, psychology, versus, nursing, majors, in, the, absence, of, personal, identity, cues, and, when, participants, had, the, option, of, a, sure, sum, of, money, i, e, in, essence, opting, out, of, the, need, to, trust, a, stranger, to, gain, some, monetary, reward, when, only, the, recipient, was, made, aware, of, group, membership, trust, becomes, reliant, upon, group, stereotypes, the, group, with, the, more, positive, stereotype, was, trusted, e, g, one, s, university, affiliation, over, another, s, even, over, that, of, the, in, group, e, g, nursing, over, psychology, majors, another, explanation, for, in, group, favoring, behaviors, could, be, the, need, to, maintain, in, group, positive, distinctiveness, particularly, in, the, presence, of, social, identity, threat, trust, in, out, group, strangers, increased, when, personal, cues, to, identity, were, revealed, many, philosophers, have, written, about, different, forms, of, trust, most, agree, that, interpersonal, trust, is, the, foundation, on, which, these, forms, can, be, modeled, for, an, act, to, be, an, expression, of, trust, it, must, not, betray, the, expectations, of, the, trustee, some, philosophers, such, as, lagerspetz, argue, that, trust, is, a, kind, of, reliance, though, not, merely, reliance, gambetta, argued, that, trust, is, the, inherent, belief, that, others, generally, have, good, intentions, which, is, the, foundation, for, our, reliance, on, them, philosophers, such, as, annette, baier, challenged, this, view, asserting, a, difference, between, trust, and, reliance, by, saying, that, trust, can, be, betrayed, whereas, reliance, can, only, be, disappointed, carolyn, mcleod, explains, baier, s, argument, with, the, following, examples, we, can, rely, on, our, clock, to, give, the, time, but, we, do, not, feel, betrayed, when, it, breaks, thus, we, cannot, say, that, we, trusted, it, we, are, not, trusting, when, we, are, suspicious, of, another, person, because, this, is, in, fact, an, expression, of, distrust, the, violation, of, trust, warrants, this, sense, of, betrayal, thus, trust, is, different, from, reliance, in, the, sense, that, a, trustor, accepts, the, risk, of, being, betrayed, karen, jones, proposed, an, emotional, aspect, to, trust, optimism, that, the, trustee, will, do, the, right, thing, by, the, trustor, which, is, also, described, as, affective, trust, people, sometimes, trust, others, even, without, this, optimistic, expectation, instead, hoping, that, by, extending, trust, this, will, prompt, trustworthy, behavior, in, the, trustee, this, is, known, as, therapeutic, trust, and, gives, both, the, trustee, a, reason, to, be, trustworthy, and, the, trustor, a, reason, to, believe, they, are, trustworthy, the, definition, of, trust, as, a, belief, in, something, or, a, confident, expectation, about, something, eliminates, the, notion, of, risk, because, it, does, not, include, whether, the, expectation, or, belief, is, favorable, or, unfavorable, for, example, to, expect, a, friend, to, arrive, to, dinner, late, because, she, has, habitually, arrived, late, for, the, last, fifteen, years, is, a, confident, expectation, whether, or, not, we, find, her, late, arrivals, to, be, annoying, the, trust, is, not, about, what, we, wish, for, but, rather, it, is, in, the, consistency, of, the, data, as, a, result, there, is, no, risk, or, sense, of, betrayal, because, the, data, exists, as, collective, knowledge, faulkner, contrasts, such, predictive, trust, with, the, aforementioned, affective, trust, proposing, that, predictive, trust, may, only, warrant, disappointment, as, a, consequence, of, an, inaccurate, prediction, not, a, sense, of, betrayal, trust, in, economics, explains, the, difference, between, actual, human, behavior, and, behavior, that, could, be, explained, by, people, s, desire, to, maximize, utility, in, economic, terms, trust, can, explain, a, difference, between, nash, equilibrium, and, the, observed, equilibrium, such, an, approach, can, be, applied, to, individual, people, as, well, as, to, societies, trust, is, important, to, economists, for, many, reasons, taking, the, market, for, lemons, transaction, popularized, by, george, akerlof, as, an, example, if, a, potential, buyer, of, a, car, does, not, trust, the, seller, not, to, sell, a, lemon, the, transaction, will, not, take, place, the, buyer, will, not, buy, without, trust, even, if, the, product, would, be, of, great, value, to, the, buyer, trust, can, act, as, an, economic, lubricant, reducing, the, cost, of, transactions, between, parties, enabling, new, forms, of, cooperation, and, generally, furthering, business, activities, employment, and, prosperity, this, observation, prompted, interest, in, trust, as, a, form, of, social, capital, and, research, into, the, process, of, creation, and, distribution, of, such, capital, a, higher, level, of, social, trust, may, be, positively, correlated, with, economic, development, even, though, the, original, concept, of, high, trust, and, low, trust, societies, may, not, necessarily, hold, social, trust, benefits, the, economy, and, a, low, level, of, trust, inhibits, economic, growth, the, absence, of, trust, restricts, growth, in, employment, wages, and, profits, thus, reducing, the, overall, welfare, of, society, the, world, economic, forums, of, 2022, and, 2024, both, adopted, the, rebuilding, of, trust, as, their, themes, theoretical, economical, modelling, demonstrates, that, the, optimum, level, of, trust, that, a, rational, economic, agent, should, exhibit, in, transactions, is, equal, to, the, trustworthiness, of, the, other, party, such, a, level, of, trust, leads, to, an, efficient, market, trusting, less, leads, to, losing, economic, opportunities, while, trusting, more, leads, to, unnecessary, vulnerabilities, and, potential, exploitation, economics, is, also, interested, in, quantifying, trust, usually, in, monetary, terms, the, level, of, correlation, between, an, increase, in, profit, margin, and, a, decrease, in, transactional, costs, can, be, used, as, an, indicator, of, the, economic, value, of, trust, economic, trust, games, empirically, quantify, trust, in, relationships, under, laboratory, conditions, several, games, and, game, like, scenarios, related, to, trust, have, been, tried, with, certain, preferences, to, those, that, allow, the, estimation, of, confidence, in, monetary, terms, in, games, of, trust, the, nash, equilibrium, differs, from, pareto, optimum, so, that, no, player, alone, can, maximize, their, own, utility, by, altering, their, selfish, strategy, without, cooperation, cooperating, partners, can, also, benefit, the, classical, version, of, the, game, of, trust, has, been, described, as, an, abstract, investment, game, using, the, scenario, of, an, investor, and, a, broker, the, investor, can, invest, some, fraction, of, his, money, and, the, broker, can, return, to, the, investor, some, fraction, of, the, investor, s, gains, if, both, players, follow, their, naive, economic, best, interest, the, investor, should, never, invest, and, the, broker, will, never, be, able, to, repay, anything, thus, the, flow, of, money, its, volume, and, its, character, is, attributable, entirely, to, the, existence, of, trust, such, a, game, can, be, played, as, a, once, off, or, repeatedly, with, the, same, or, different, sets, of, players, to, distinguish, between, a, general, propensity, to, trust, and, trust, within, particular, relationships, several, variants, of, this, game, exist, reversing, rules, leads, to, the, game, of, distrust, pre, declarations, can, be, used, to, establish, intentions, of, players, while, alterations, to, the, distribution, of, gains, can, be, used, to, manipulate, the, perceptions, of, both, players, the, game, can, be, played, by, several, players, on, the, closed, market, with, or, without, information, about, reputation, other, interesting, games, include, binary, choice, trust, games, and, the, gift, exchange, game, games, based, on, the, prisoner, s, dilemma, link, trust, with, economic, utility, and, demonstrate, the, rationality, behind, reciprocity, the, popularization, of, e, commerce, led, to, new, challenges, related, to, trust, within, the, digital, economy, and, the, desire, to, understand, buyers, and, sellers, decisions, to, trust, one, another, for, example, interpersonal, relationships, between, buyers, and, sellers, have, been, disintermediated, by, the, technology, and, consequentially, they, required, improvement, websites, can, influence, the, buyer, to, trust, the, seller, regardless, of, the, seller, s, actual, trustworthiness, reputation, based, systems, can, improve, trust, assessment, by, capturing, a, collective, perception, of, trustworthiness, this, has, generated, interest, in, various, models, of, reputation, in, management, and, organization, science, trust, is, studied, as, a, factor, which, organizational, actors, can, manage, and, influence, scholars, have, researched, how, trust, develops, across, individual, and, organizational, levels, of, analysis, they, suggest, a, reciprocal, process, in, which, organizational, structures, influence, people, s, trust, and, at, the, same, time, people, s, trust, manifests, in, organizational, structures, trust, is, also, one, of, the, conditions, of, an, organizational, culture, that, supports, knowledge, sharing, an, organizational, culture, that, supports, knowledge, sharing, allows, employees, to, feel, secure, and, comfortable, to, share, their, knowledge, their, work, and, their, expertise, structure, often, creates, trust, in, a, person, and, this, encourages, them, to, feel, comfortable, and, excel, in, the, workplace, it, makes, an, otherwise, stressful, environment, manageable, management, and, organization, science, scholars, have, also, studied, how, trust, is, influenced, by, contracts, and, how, trust, interacts, with, formal, mechanisms, scholars, in, management, and, related, disciplines, have, also, made, a, case, for, the, importance, of, distrust, as, a, related, but, distinct, construct, similarly, scholars, have, assessed, the, relationship, between, monitoring, and, trust, for, example, in, a, trust, game, context, and, in, shareholder, management, relations, since, the, mid, 1990s, organizational, research, has, followed, two, distinct, but, nonexclusive, paradigms, of, trust, research, together, these, paradigms, predict, how, different, dimensions, of, trust, form, in, organizations, by, demonstrating, various, trustworthiness, attributes, in, systems, a, trusted, component, has, a, set, of, properties, that, another, component, can, rely, on, if, a, trusts, b, a, violation, in, b, s, properties, might, compromise, a, s, correct, operation, observe, that, those, properties, of, b, trusted, by, a, might, not, correspond, quantitatively, or, qualitatively, to, b, s, actual, properties, this, occurs, when, the, designer, of, the, overall, system, does, not, consider, the, relation, consequently, trust, should, be, placed, to, the, extent, of, the, component, s, trustworthiness, the, trustworthiness, of, a, component, is, thus, not, surprisingly, defined, by, how, well, it, secures, a, set, of, functional, and, non, functional, properties, deriving, from, its, architecture, construction, and, environment, and, evaluated, as, appropriate, trust, in, politics, is, political, efficacy
