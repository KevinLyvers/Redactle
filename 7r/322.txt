in, linguistics, prosody, p, r, s, d, i, p, r, z, is, the, study, of, elements, of, speech, that, are, not, individual, phonetic, segments, vowels, and, consonants, but, which, are, properties, of, syllables, and, larger, units, of, speech, including, linguistic, functions, such, as, intonation, stress, and, rhythm, such, elements, are, known, as, suprasegmentals, prosody, reflects, the, nuanced, emotional, features, of, the, speaker, or, of, their, utterances, their, obvious, or, underlying, emotional, state, the, form, of, utterance, statement, question, or, command, the, presence, of, irony, or, sarcasm, certain, emphasis, on, words, or, morphemes, contrast, focus, and, so, on, prosody, displays, elements, of, language, that, are, not, encoded, by, grammar, punctuation, or, choice, of, vocabulary, in, the, study, of, prosodic, aspects, of, speech, it, is, usual, to, distinguish, between, auditory, measures, subjective, impressions, produced, in, the, mind, of, the, listener, and, objective, measures, physical, properties, of, the, sound, wave, and, physiological, characteristics, of, articulation, that, may, be, measured, objectively, auditory, subjective, and, objective, acoustic, and, articulatory, measures, of, prosody, do, not, correspond, in, a, linear, way, most, studies, of, prosody, have, been, based, on, auditory, analysis, using, auditory, scales, auditorily, the, major, prosodic, variables, are, acoustically, these, prosodic, variables, correspond, closely, to, different, combinations, of, these, variables, are, exploited, in, the, linguistic, functions, of, intonation, and, stress, as, well, as, other, prosodic, features, such, as, rhythm, and, tempo, additional, prosodic, variables, have, been, studied, including, voice, quality, and, pausing, the, behavior, of, the, prosodic, variables, can, be, studied, either, as, contours, across, the, prosodic, unit, or, by, the, behavior, of, boundaries, prosodic, features, are, suprasegmental, since, they, are, properties, of, units, of, speech, that, are, defined, over, groups, of, sounds, rather, than, single, segments, when, talking, about, prosodic, features, it, is, important, to, distinguish, between, the, personal, characteristics, that, belong, to, an, individual, s, voice, for, example, their, habitual, pitch, range, intonation, patterns, etc, and, the, independently, variable, prosodic, features, that, are, used, contrastively, to, communicate, meaning, for, example, the, use, of, changes, in, pitch, to, indicate, the, difference, between, statements, and, questions, personal, characteristics, that, belong, to, an, individual, are, not, linguistically, significant, while, prosodic, features, are, prosody, has, been, found, across, all, languages, and, is, described, to, be, a, natural, component, of, language, the, defining, features, of, prosody, that, display, the, nuanced, emotions, of, an, individual, differ, across, languages, and, cultures, some, writers, e, g, o, connor, and, arnold, have, described, intonation, entirely, in, terms, of, pitch, while, others, e, g, crystal, propose, that, intonation, is, a, combination, of, several, prosodic, variables, english, intonation, is, often, said, to, be, based, on, three, aspects, the, choice, of, pitch, movement, and, the, highlighting, of, particular, words, to, create, different, intonation, patterns, can, be, seen, in, the, following, english, conversation, the, exchange, above, is, an, example, of, using, intonation, to, highlight, particular, words, and, to, employ, rising, and, falling, of, pitch, to, change, meaning, if, read, out, loud, the, pitch, of, the, voice, moves, in, different, directions, on, the, word, cat, in, the, first, line, pitch, goes, up, indicating, a, question, in, the, second, line, pitch, falls, indicating, a, statement, a, confirmation, of, the, first, line, in, this, case, finally, in, the, third, line, a, complicated, rise, fall, pattern, indicates, incredulity, each, pitch, intonation, pattern, communicates, a, different, meaning, an, additional, pitch, related, variation, is, pitch, range, speakers, are, capable, of, speaking, with, a, wide, range, of, pitch, this, is, usually, associated, with, excitement, while, at, other, times, with, a, narrow, range, english, makes, use, of, changes, in, key, shifting, one, s, intonation, into, the, higher, or, lower, part, of, one, s, pitch, range, is, believed, to, be, meaningful, in, certain, contexts, stress, functions, as, the, means, of, making, a, syllable, prominent, stress, may, be, studied, in, relation, to, individual, words, named, word, stress, or, lexical, stress, or, in, relation, to, larger, units, of, speech, traditionally, referred, to, as, sentence, stress, but, more, appropriately, named, prosodic, stress, stressed, syllables, are, made, prominent, by, several, variables, stress, is, typically, associated, with, the, following, some, of, these, cues, are, more, powerful, or, prominent, than, others, alan, cruttenden, for, example, writes, perceptual, experiments, have, clearly, shown, that, in, english, at, any, rate, the, three, features, pitch, length, and, loudness, form, a, scale, of, importance, in, bringing, syllables, into, prominence, pitch, being, the, most, efficacious, and, loudness, the, least, so, when, pitch, prominence, is, the, major, factor, the, resulting, prominence, is, often, called, accent, rather, than, stress, there, is, considerable, variation, from, language, to, language, concerning, the, role, of, stress, in, identifying, words, or, in, interpreting, grammar, and, syntax, although, rhythm, is, not, a, prosodic, variable, in, the, way, that, pitch, or, loudness, are, it, is, usual, to, treat, a, language, s, characteristic, rhythm, as, a, part, of, its, prosodic, phonology, it, has, often, been, asserted, that, languages, exhibit, regularity, in, the, timing, of, successive, units, of, speech, a, regularity, referred, to, as, isochrony, and, that, every, language, may, be, assigned, one, of, three, rhythmical, types, stress, timed, where, the, durations, of, the, intervals, between, stressed, syllables, is, relatively, constant, syllable, timed, where, the, durations, of, successive, syllables, are, relatively, constant, and, mora, timed, where, the, durations, of, successive, morae, are, relatively, constant, as, explained, in, the, isochrony, article, this, claim, has, not, been, supported, by, scientific, evidence, voiced, or, unvoiced, the, pause, is, a, form, of, interruption, to, articulatory, continuity, such, as, an, open, or, terminal, juncture, conversation, analysis, commonly, notes, pause, length, distinguishing, auditory, hesitation, from, silent, pauses, is, one, challenge, contrasting, junctures, within, and, without, word, chunks, can, aid, in, identifying, pauses, there, are, a, variety, of, filled, pause, types, formulaic, language, pause, fillers, include, like, er, and, um, and, paralinguistic, expressive, respiratory, pauses, include, the, sigh, and, gasp, although, related, to, breathing, pauses, may, contain, contrastive, linguistic, content, as, in, the, periods, between, individual, words, in, english, advertising, voice, over, copy, sometimes, placed, to, denote, high, information, content, e, g, quality, service, value, pausing, or, its, lack, contributes, to, the, perception, of, word, groups, or, chunks, examples, include, the, phrase, phraseme, constituent, or, interjection, chunks, commonly, highlight, lexical, items, or, fixed, expression, idioms, chunking, prosody, is, present, on, any, complete, utterance, and, may, correspond, to, a, syntactic, category, but, not, necessarily, the, well, known, english, chunk, know, what, i, mean, in, common, usage, sounds, like, a, single, word, no, wada, meen, due, to, blurring, or, rushing, the, articulation, of, adjacent, word, syllables, thereby, changing, the, potential, open, junctures, between, words, into, closed, junctures, prosody, has, had, a, number, of, perceptually, significant, functions, in, english, and, other, languages, contributing, to, the, recognition, and, comprehension, of, speech, it, is, believed, that, prosody, assists, listeners, in, parsing, continuous, speech, and, in, the, recognition, of, words, providing, cues, to, syntactic, structure, grammatical, boundaries, and, sentence, type, boundaries, between, intonation, units, are, often, associated, with, grammatical, or, syntactic, boundaries, these, are, marked, by, such, prosodic, features, as, pauses, and, slowing, of, tempo, as, well, as, pitch, reset, where, the, speaker, s, pitch, level, returns, to, the, level, typical, of, the, onset, of, a, new, intonation, unit, in, this, way, potential, ambiguities, may, be, resolved, for, example, the, sentence, they, invited, bob, and, bill, and, al, got, rejected, is, ambiguous, when, written, although, addition, of, a, written, comma, after, either, bob, or, bill, will, remove, the, sentence, s, ambiguity, but, when, the, sentence, is, read, aloud, prosodic, cues, like, pauses, dividing, the, sentence, into, chunks, and, changes, in, intonation, will, reduce, or, remove, the, ambiguity, moving, the, intonational, boundary, in, cases, such, as, the, above, example, will, tend, to, change, the, interpretation, of, the, sentence, this, result, has, been, found, in, studies, performed, in, both, english, and, bulgarian, research, in, english, word, recognition, has, demonstrated, an, important, role, for, prosody, intonation, and, stress, work, together, to, highlight, important, words, or, syllables, for, contrast, and, focus, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, accentual, function, of, prosody, a, well, known, example, is, the, ambiguous, sentence, i, never, said, she, stole, my, money, where, there, are, seven, meaning, changes, depending, on, which, of, the, seven, words, is, vocally, highlighted, prosody, helps, convey, many, other, pragmatic, functions, including, expressing, attitudes, approval, uncertainty, dissatisfaction, and, so, on, flagging, turn, taking, intentions, to, hold, the, floor, to, yield, the, turn, to, invite, a, backchannel, like, uh, huh, and, so, on, and, marking, topic, structure, starting, a, new, topic, closing, a, topic, interpolating, a, parenthetical, remark, and, so, on, among, others, for, example, david, brazil, and, his, associates, studied, how, intonation, can, indicate, whether, information, is, new, or, already, established, whether, a, speaker, is, dominant, or, not, in, a, conversation, and, when, a, speaker, is, inviting, the, listener, to, make, a, contribution, to, the, conversation, prosody, is, also, important, in, signalling, emotions, and, attitudes, when, this, is, involuntary, as, when, the, voice, is, affected, by, anxiety, or, fear, the, prosodic, information, is, not, linguistically, significant, however, when, the, speaker, varies, their, speech, intentionally, for, example, to, indicate, sarcasm, this, usually, involves, the, use, of, prosodic, features, the, most, useful, prosodic, feature, in, detecting, sarcasm, is, a, reduction, in, the, mean, fundamental, frequency, relative, to, other, speech, for, humor, neutrality, or, sincerity, while, prosodic, cues, are, important, in, indicating, sarcasm, context, clues, and, shared, knowledge, are, also, important, emotional, prosody, was, considered, by, charles, darwin, in, the, descent, of, man, to, predate, the, evolution, of, human, language, even, monkeys, express, strong, feelings, in, different, tones, anger, and, impatience, by, low, fear, and, pain, by, high, notes, native, speakers, listening, to, actors, reading, emotionally, neutral, text, while, projecting, emotions, correctly, recognized, happiness, 62, of, the, time, anger, 95, surprise, 91, sadness, 81, and, neutral, tone, 76, when, a, database, of, this, speech, was, processed, by, computer, segmental, features, allowed, better, than, 90, recognition, of, happiness, and, anger, while, suprasegmental, prosodic, features, allowed, only, 44, 49, recognition, the, reverse, was, true, for, surprise, which, was, recognized, only, 69, of, the, time, by, segmental, features, and, 96, of, the, time, by, suprasegmental, prosody, in, typical, conversation, no, actor, voice, involved, the, recognition, of, emotion, may, be, quite, low, of, the, order, of, 50, hampering, the, complex, interrelationship, function, of, speech, advocated, by, some, authors, however, even, if, emotional, expression, through, prosody, cannot, always, be, consciously, recognized, tone, of, voice, may, continue, to, have, subconscious, effects, in, conversation, this, sort, of, expression, stems, not, from, linguistic, or, semantic, effects, and, can, thus, be, isolated, from, traditional, linguistic, content, aptitude, of, the, average, person, to, decode, conversational, implicature, of, emotional, prosody, has, been, found, to, be, slightly, less, accurate, than, traditional, facial, expression, discrimination, ability, however, specific, ability, to, decode, varies, by, emotion, these, emotional, have, been, determined, to, be, ubiquitous, across, cultures, as, they, are, utilized, and, understood, across, cultures, various, emotions, and, their, general, experimental, identification, rates, are, as, follows, the, prosody, of, an, utterance, is, used, by, listeners, to, guide, decisions, about, the, emotional, affect, of, the, situation, whether, a, person, decodes, the, prosody, as, positive, negative, or, neutral, plays, a, role, in, the, way, a, person, decodes, a, facial, expression, accompanying, an, utterance, as, the, facial, expression, becomes, closer, to, neutral, the, prosodic, interpretation, influences, the, interpretation, of, the, facial, expression, a, study, by, marc, d, pell, revealed, that, 600, ms, of, prosodic, information, is, necessary, for, listeners, to, be, able, to, identify, the, affective, tone, of, the, utterance, at, lengths, below, this, there, was, not, enough, information, for, listeners, to, process, the, emotional, context, of, the, utterance, unique, prosodic, features, have, been, noted, in, infant, directed, speech, ids, also, known, as, baby, talk, child, directed, speech, cds, or, motherese, adults, especially, caregivers, speaking, to, young, children, tend, to, imitate, childlike, speech, by, using, higher, and, more, variable, pitch, as, well, as, an, exaggerated, stress, these, prosodic, characteristics, are, thought, to, assist, children, in, acquiring, phonemes, segmenting, words, and, recognizing, phrasal, boundaries, and, though, there, is, no, evidence, to, indicate, that, infant, directed, speech, is, necessary, for, language, acquisition, these, specific, prosodic, features, have, been, observed, in, many, different, languages, an, aprosodia, is, an, acquired, or, developmental, impairment, in, comprehending, or, generating, the, emotion, conveyed, in, spoken, language, aprosody, is, often, accompanied, by, the, inability, to, properly, utilize, variations, in, speech, particularly, with, deficits, in, the, ability, to, accurately, modulate, pitch, loudness, intonation, and, rhythm, of, word, formation, this, is, seen, sometimes, in, autistic, individuals, the, three, main, types, of, aprosodia, are, lexical, prosody, refers, to, the, specific, amplitudes, pitches, or, lengths, of, vowels, that, are, applied, to, specific, syllables, in, words, based, on, what, the, speaker, wants, to, emphasize, the, different, stressors, placed, on, individual, syllables, can, change, entire, meanings, of, a, word, take, one, popular, english, word, for, example, in, english, lexical, prosody, is, used, for, a, few, different, reasons, as, we, have, seen, above, lexical, prosody, was, used, to, change, the, form, of, a, word, from, a, noun, to, a, verb, another, function, of, lexical, prosody, has, to, do, with, the, grammatical, role, that, a, word, plays, within, a, sentence, adjectives, and, nouns, of, a, sentence, are, often, stressed, on, the, first, syllables, while, verbs, are, often, stressed, on, the, second, syllable, for, example, here, adults, will, emphasize, the, first, syllable, in, as, increase, functions, as, an, adjective, here, adults, will, emphasize, the, second, syllable, crease, as, increase, functions, as, a, verb, another, way, that, lexical, prosody, is, used, in, the, english, language, is, in, compound, nouns, such, as, wishbone, mailbox, and, blackbird, where, the, first, compound, is, emphasized, some, suffixes, can, also, affect, the, ways, in, which, different, words, are, stressed, take, active, for, example, without, the, suffix, the, lexical, emphasis, is, on, ac, however, when, we, add, the, suffix, ity, the, stress, shifts, to, tiv, phrasal, prosody, refers, to, the, rhythm, and, tempo, of, phrases, often, in, an, artistic, setting, such, as, music, or, poetry, but, not, always, the, rhythm, of, the, english, language, has, four, different, elements, stress, time, pause, and, pitch, furthermore, when, stress, is, the, basis, of, the, metric, pattern, we, have, poetry, when, pitch, is, the, pattern, basis, we, have, rhythmic, prose, weeks, 11, stress, retraction, is, a, popular, example, of, phrasal, prosody, in, everyday, life, for, example, contrastive, stress, is, another, everyday, english, example, of, phrasal, prosody, that, helps, us, determine, what, parts, of, the, sentence, are, important, take, these, sentences, for, example, emphasizing, that, the, stairs, is, how, the, man, went, up, emphasizing, that, it, was, a, man, who, went, up, the, stairs, it, s, important, to, note, that, the, right, hemisphere, of, the, brain, dominates, one, s, perception, of, prosody, in, contrast, to, left, hemisphere, damage, where, patterns, of, aphasias, are, present, patterns, of, aprosodias, are, present, with, damage, to, the, left, hemisphere, in, patients, with, right, hemisphere, lesions, they, are, characterized, as, monotonous, and, as, lacking, variety, in, their, tone, and, expression, they, re, also, seen, to, struggle, with, the, identification, and, discrimination, of, semantically, neutral, sentences, with, varying, tones, of, happiness, sadness, anger, and, indifference, exemplifying, the, importance, of, prosody, in, language, comprehension, and, production, producing, these, nonverbal, elements, requires, intact, motor, areas, of, the, face, mouth, tongue, and, throat, this, area, is, associated, with, brodmann, areas, 44, and, 45, broca, s, area, of, the, left, frontal, lobe, damage, to, areas, 44, 45, specifically, on, the, right, hemisphere, produces, motor, aprosodia, with, the, nonverbal, elements, of, speech, being, disturbed, facial, expression, tone, rhythm, of, voice, understanding, these, nonverbal, elements, requires, an, intact, and, properly, functioning, right, hemisphere, perisylvian, area, particularly, brodmann, area, 22, not, to, be, confused, with, the, corresponding, area, in, the, left, hemisphere, which, contains, wernicke, s, area, damage, to, the, right, inferior, frontal, gyrus, causes, a, diminished, ability, to, convey, emotion, or, emphasis, by, voice, or, gesture, and, damage, to, right, superior, temporal, gyrus, causes, problems, comprehending, emotion, or, emphasis, in, the, voice, or, gestures, of, others, the, right, brodmann, area, 22, aids, in, the, interpretation, of, prosody, and, damage, causes, sensory, aprosodia, with, the, patient, unable, to, comprehend, changes, in, voice, and, body, language
