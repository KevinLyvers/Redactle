1800s, martineau, tocqueville, marx, spencer, le, bon, ward, pareto, t, nnies, veblen, simmel, durkheim, addams, mead, weber, du, bois, mannheim, elias, an, institution, is, a, humanly, devised, structure, of, rules, and, norms, that, shape, and, constrain, social, behavior, all, definitions, of, institutions, generally, entail, that, there, is, a, level, of, persistence, and, continuity, laws, rules, social, conventions, and, norms, are, all, examples, of, institutions, institutions, vary, in, their, level, of, formality, and, informality, institutions, are, a, principal, object, of, study, in, social, sciences, such, as, political, science, anthropology, economics, and, sociology, the, latter, described, by, mile, durkheim, as, the, science, of, institutions, their, genesis, and, their, functioning, primary, or, meta, institutions, are, institutions, such, as, the, family, or, money, that, are, broad, enough, to, encompass, sets, of, related, institutions, institutions, are, also, a, central, concern, for, law, the, formal, mechanism, for, political, rule, making, and, enforcement, historians, study, and, document, the, founding, growth, decay, and, development, of, institutions, as, part, of, political, economic, and, cultural, history, there, are, a, variety, of, definitions, of, the, term, institution, these, definitions, entail, varying, levels, of, formality, and, organizational, complexity, the, most, expansive, definitions, may, include, informal, but, regularized, practices, such, as, handshakes, whereas, the, most, narrow, definitions, may, only, include, institutions, that, are, highly, formalized, e, g, have, specified, laws, rules, and, complex, organizational, structures, according, to, wolfgang, streeck, and, kathleen, thelen, institutions, are, in, the, most, general, sense, building, blocks, of, social, order, they, represent, socially, sanctioned, that, is, collectively, enforced, expectations, with, respect, to, the, behavior, of, specific, categories, of, actors, or, to, the, performance, of, certain, activities, typically, they, involve, mutually, related, rights, and, obligations, for, actors, sociologists, and, anthropologists, have, expansive, definitions, of, institutions, that, include, informal, institutions, political, scientists, have, sometimes, defined, institutions, in, more, formal, ways, where, third, parties, must, reliably, and, predictably, enforce, the, rules, governing, the, transactions, of, first, and, second, parties, one, prominent, rational, choice, institutionalist, definition, of, institutions, is, provided, by, jack, knight, who, defines, institutions, as, entailing, a, set, of, rules, that, structure, social, interactions, in, particular, ways, and, that, knowledge, of, these, rules, must, be, shared, by, the, members, of, the, relevant, community, or, society, definitions, by, knight, and, randall, calvert, exclude, purely, private, idiosyncrasies, and, conventions, douglass, north, argues, that, institutions, are, humanly, devised, constraints, that, shape, interaction, according, to, north, they, are, critical, determinants, of, economic, performance, having, profound, effects, on, the, costs, of, exchange, and, production, he, emphasizes, that, small, historical, and, cultural, features, can, drastically, change, the, nature, of, an, institution, daron, acemoglu, simon, johnson, and, james, a, robinson, agree, with, the, analysis, presented, by, north, they, write, that, institutions, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, trajectory, of, economic, growth, because, economic, institutions, shape, the, opportunities, and, constraints, of, investment, economic, incentives, also, shape, political, behavior, as, certain, groups, receive, more, advantages, from, economic, outcomes, than, others, which, allow, them, to, gain, political, control, a, separate, paper, by, acemoglu, robinson, and, francisco, a, gallego, details, the, relationships, between, institutions, human, capital, and, economic, development, they, argue, that, institutions, set, an, equal, playing, field, for, competition, making, institutional, strength, a, key, factor, in, economic, growth, authors, steven, levitsky, and, mar, a, victoria, murillo, claim, that, institutional, strength, depends, on, two, factors, stability, and, enforcement, an, unstable, unenforced, institution, is, one, where, weak, rules, are, ignored, and, actors, are, unable, to, make, expectations, based, on, their, behavior, in, a, weak, institution, actors, cannot, depend, on, one, another, to, act, according, to, the, rules, which, creates, barriers, to, collective, action, and, collaboration, other, social, scientists, have, examined, the, concept, of, institutional, lock, in, in, an, article, entitled, clio, and, the, economics, of, qwerty, 1985, economist, paul, a, david, describes, technological, lock, in, as, the, process, by, which, a, specific, technology, dominates, the, market, even, when, the, technology, is, not, the, most, efficient, of, the, ones, available, he, proceeds, to, explain, that, lock, in, is, a, result, of, path, dependence, where, the, early, choice, of, technology, in, a, market, forces, other, actors, to, choose, that, technology, regardless, of, their, natural, preferences, causing, that, technology, to, lock, in, economist, w, brian, arthur, applied, david, s, theories, to, institutions, as, with, a, technology, institutions, in, the, form, of, law, policy, social, regulations, or, otherwise, can, become, locked, into, a, society, which, in, turn, can, shape, social, or, economic, development, arthur, notes, that, although, institutional, lock, in, can, be, predictable, it, is, often, difficult, to, change, once, it, is, locked, in, because, of, its, deep, roots, in, social, and, economic, frameworks, randall, calvert, defines, institution, as, an, equilibrium, of, behavior, in, an, underlying, game, this, means, that, it, must, be, rational, for, nearly, every, individual, to, almost, always, adhere, to, the, behavior, prescriptions, of, the, institution, given, that, nearly, all, other, individuals, are, doing, so, robert, keohane, defined, institutions, as, persistent, and, connected, sets, of, rules, formal, or, informal, that, prescribe, behavioral, roles, constrain, activity, and, shape, expectations, samuel, p, huntington, defined, institutions, as, stable, valued, recurring, patterns, of, behavior, avner, greif, and, david, laitin, define, institutions, as, a, system, of, human, made, nonphysical, elements, norms, beliefs, organizations, and, rules, exogenous, to, each, individual, whose, behavior, it, influences, that, generates, behavioral, regularities, additionally, they, specify, that, organizations, are, institutional, elements, that, influence, the, set, of, beliefs, and, norms, that, can, be, self, enforcing, in, the, transaction, under, consideration, rules, are, behavioral, instructions, that, facilitate, individuals, with, the, cognitive, task, of, choosing, behavior, by, defining, the, situation, and, coordinating, behavior, all, definitions, of, institutions, generally, entail, that, there, is, a, level, of, persistence, and, continuity, laws, rules, social, conventions, and, norms, are, all, examples, of, institutions, organizations, and, institutions, can, be, synonymous, but, jack, knight, writes, that, organizations, are, a, narrow, version, of, institutions, or, represent, a, cluster, of, institutions, the, two, are, distinct, in, the, sense, that, organizations, contain, internal, institutions, that, govern, interactions, between, the, members, of, the, organizations, an, informal, institution, tends, to, have, socially, shared, rules, which, are, unwritten, and, yet, are, often, known, by, all, inhabitants, of, a, certain, country, as, such, they, are, often, referred, to, as, being, an, inherent, part, of, the, culture, of, a, given, country, informal, practices, are, often, referred, to, as, cultural, for, example, clientelism, or, corruption, is, sometimes, stated, as, a, part, of, the, political, culture, in, a, certain, place, but, an, informal, institution, itself, is, not, cultural, it, may, be, shaped, by, culture, or, behaviour, of, a, given, political, landscape, but, they, should, be, looked, at, in, the, same, way, as, formal, institutions, to, understand, their, role, in, a, given, country, the, relationship, between, formal, and, informal, institutions, is, often, closely, aligned, and, informal, institutions, step, in, to, prop, up, inefficient, institutions, however, because, they, do, not, have, a, centre, which, directs, and, coordinates, their, actions, changing, informal, institutions, is, a, slow, and, lengthy, process, according, to, geoffrey, m, hodgson, it, is, misleading, to, say, that, an, institution, is, a, form, of, behavior, instead, hodgson, states, that, institutions, are, integrated, systems, of, rules, that, structure, social, interactions, examples, of, institutions, include, in, an, extended, context, while, institutions, tend, to, appear, to, people, in, society, as, part, of, the, natural, unchanging, landscape, of, their, lives, the, study, of, institutions, by, the, social, sciences, tends, to, reveal, the, nature, of, institutions, as, social, constructions, artifacts, of, a, particular, time, culture, and, society, produced, by, collective, human, choice, though, not, directly, by, individual, intention, sociology, traditionally, analyzed, social, institutions, in, terms, of, interlocking, social, roles, and, expectations, social, institutions, created, and, were, composed, of, groups, of, roles, or, expected, behaviors, the, social, function, of, the, institution, was, executed, by, the, fulfillment, of, roles, basic, biological, requirements, for, reproduction, and, care, of, the, young, are, served, by, the, institutions, of, marriage, and, family, for, example, by, creating, elaborating, and, prescribing, the, behaviors, expected, for, husband, father, wife, mother, child, etc, the, relationship, of, the, institutions, to, human, nature, is, a, foundational, question, for, the, social, sciences, institutions, can, be, seen, as, naturally, arising, from, and, conforming, to, human, nature, a, fundamentally, conservative, view, or, institutions, can, be, seen, as, artificial, almost, accidental, and, in, need, of, architectural, redesign, informed, by, expert, social, analysis, to, better, serve, human, needs, a, fundamentally, progressive, view, adam, smith, anchored, his, economics, in, the, supposed, human, propensity, to, truck, barter, and, exchange, modern, feminists, have, criticized, traditional, marriage, and, other, institutions, as, element, of, an, oppressive, and, obsolete, patriarchy, the, marxist, view, which, sees, human, nature, as, historically, evolving, towards, voluntary, social, cooperation, shared, by, some, anarchists, is, that, supra, individual, institutions, such, as, the, market, and, the, state, are, incompatible, with, the, individual, liberty, of, a, truly, free, society, economic, s, in, recent, years, has, used, game, theory, to, study, institutions, from, two, perspectives, firstly, how, do, institutions, survive, and, evolve, in, this, perspective, institutions, arise, from, nash, equilibria, of, games, for, example, whenever, people, pass, each, other, in, a, corridor, or, thoroughfare, there, is, a, need, for, customs, which, avoid, collisions, such, a, custom, might, call, for, each, party, to, keep, to, their, own, right, or, left, such, a, choice, is, arbitrary, it, is, only, necessary, that, the, choice, be, uniform, and, consistent, such, customs, may, be, supposed, to, be, the, origin, of, rules, such, as, the, rule, adopted, in, many, countries, which, requires, driving, automobiles, on, the, right, side, of, the, road, secondly, how, do, institutions, affect, behaviour, in, this, perspective, the, focus, is, on, behaviour, arising, from, a, given, set, of, institutional, rules, in, these, models, institutions, determine, the, rules, i, e, strategy, sets, and, utility, functions, of, games, rather, than, arise, as, equilibria, out, of, games, douglass, north, argues, the, very, emergence, of, an, institution, reflects, behavioral, adaptations, through, his, application, of, increasing, returns, over, time, institutions, develop, rules, that, incentivize, certain, behaviors, over, others, because, they, present, less, risk, or, induce, lower, cost, and, establish, path, dependent, outcomes, for, example, the, cournot, duopoly, model, is, based, on, an, institution, involving, an, auctioneer, who, sells, all, goods, at, the, market, clearing, price, while, it, is, always, possible, to, analyze, behaviour, with, the, institutions, as, equilibria, approach, instead, it, is, much, more, complicated, in, political, science, the, effect, of, institutions, on, behavior, has, also, been, considered, from, a, meme, perspective, like, game, theory, borrowed, from, biology, a, memetic, institutionalism, has, been, proposed, suggesting, that, institutions, provide, selection, environments, for, political, action, whereby, differentiated, retention, arises, and, thereby, a, darwinian, evolution, of, institutions, over, time, public, choice, theory, another, branch, of, economics, with, a, close, relationship, to, political, science, considers, how, government, policy, choices, are, made, and, seeks, to, determine, what, the, policy, outputs, are, likely, to, be, given, a, particular, political, decision, making, process, and, context, credibility, thesis, purports, that, institutions, emerge, from, intentional, institution, building, but, never, in, the, originally, intended, form, instead, institutional, development, is, endogenous, and, spontaneously, ordered, and, institutional, persistence, can, be, explained, by, their, credibility, which, is, provided, by, the, function, that, particular, institutions, serve, political, scientists, have, traditionally, studied, the, causes, and, consequences, of, formal, institutional, design, for, instance, douglass, north, investigated, the, impact, of, institutions, on, economic, development, in, various, countries, concluding, that, institutions, in, prosperous, countries, like, the, united, states, induced, a, net, increase, in, productivity, whereas, institutions, in, third, world, countries, caused, a, net, decrease, scholars, of, this, period, assumed, that, parchment, institutions, that, were, codified, as, law, would, largely, guide, the, behavior, of, individuals, as, intended, on, the, other, hand, recent, scholars, began, to, study, the, importance, of, institutional, strength, which, steven, levitsky, and, mar, a, victoria, murillo, define, in, terms, of, the, level, of, enforcement, and, sustainability, of, an, institution, weak, institutions, with, low, enforcement, or, low, sustainability, led, to, the, deterioration, of, democratic, institutions, in, madagascar, and, the, erosion, of, economic, structures, in, china, another, area, of, interest, for, modern, scholars, is, de, facto, informal, institutions, as, opposed, to, de, jure, formal, institutions, in, observing, cross, country, differences, for, instance, lars, feld, and, stefan, voigt, found, that, real, gdp, growth, per, capita, is, positively, correlated, with, de, facto, not, de, juri, institutions, that, are, judicially, independent, scholars, have, also, focused, on, the, interaction, between, formal, and, informal, institutions, as, well, as, how, informal, institutions, may, create, incentives, to, comply, with, otherwise, weak, formal, institutions, this, departure, from, the, traditional, understanding, of, institutions, reflects, the, scholarly, recognition, that, a, different, framework, of, institutional, analysis, is, necessary, for, studying, developing, economies, and, democracies, compared, to, developed, countries, in, history, a, distinction, between, eras, or, periods, implies, a, major, and, fundamental, change, in, the, system, of, institutions, governing, a, society, political, and, military, events, are, judged, to, be, of, historical, significance, to, the, extent, that, they, are, associated, with, changes, in, institutions, in, european, history, particular, significance, is, attached, to, the, long, transition, from, the, feudal, institutions, of, the, middle, ages, to, the, modern, institutions, which, govern, contemporary, life, scholars, have, proposed, different, approaches, to, the, emergence, of, institutions, such, as, spontaneous, emergence, evolution, and, social, contracts, in, institutions, institutional, change, and, economic, performance, douglas, north, argues, that, institutions, may, be, created, such, as, a, country, s, constitution, or, that, they, may, evolve, over, time, as, societies, evolve, in, the, case, of, institutional, evolution, it, is, harder, to, see, them, since, societal, changes, happen, in, a, slow, manner, despite, the, perception, that, institutional, change, is, rapid, furthermore, institutions, change, incrementally, because, of, how, embedded, they, are, in, society, north, argues, that, the, nature, of, these, changes, is, complicated, process, because, of, the, changes, in, rules, informal, constraints, and, the, effectiveness, of, enforcement, of, these, institutions, levitsky, and, murillo, explore, the, way, institutions, are, created, when, it, comes, to, institutional, design, the, timeframe, in, which, these, institutions, are, created, by, different, actors, may, affect, the, stability, the, institution, will, have, on, society, because, in, these, cases, the, actors, may, have, more, or, less, time, to, fully, calculate, the, impacts, the, institution, in, question, will, have, the, way, the, new, rules, affect, people, s, interests, and, their, own, and, the, consequences, of, the, creation, of, a, new, institution, will, have, in, society, scholars, like, christopher, kingston, and, gonzalo, caballero, also, pose, the, importance, of, gradual, societal, change, in, the, emergence, of, brand, new, institutions, these, changes, will, determine, which, institutions, will, be, successful, in, surviving, spreading, and, becoming, successful, the, decisions, actors, within, a, society, make, also, have, lot, to, do, in, the, survival, and, eventual, evolution, of, an, institution, they, foster, groups, who, want, to, maintain, the, set, of, rules, of, the, game, as, described, by, north, keeping, a, status, quo, impeding, institutional, change, people, s, interests, play, an, important, role, in, determining, the, direction, of, institutional, change, and, emergence, some, scholars, argue, that, institutions, can, emerge, spontaneously, without, intent, as, individuals, and, groups, converge, on, a, particular, institutional, arrangement, other, approaches, see, institutional, development, as, the, result, of, evolutionary, or, learning, processes, for, instance, pavlovi, explores, the, way, compliance, and, socio, economic, conditions, in, a, consolidated, democratic, state, are, important, in, the, emergence, of, institutions, and, the, compliance, power, they, have, for, the, rules, imposed, in, his, work, he, explains, the, difference, between, wealthy, societies, and, non, wealthy, societies, wealthy, societies, on, one, hand, often, have, institutions, that, have, been, functioning, for, a, while, but, also, have, a, stable, economy, and, economic, development, that, has, a, direct, effect, in, the, society, s, democratic, stability, he, presents, us, with, three, scenarios, in, which, institutions, may, thrive, in, poor, societies, with, no, democratic, background, first, if, electoral, institutions, guarantee, multiple, elections, that, are, widely, accepted, second, if, military, power, is, in, evenly, equilibrium, and, third, if, this, institutions, allow, for, different, actors, to, come, to, power, other, scholars, see, institutions, as, being, formed, through, social, contracts, or, rational, purposeful, designs, origin, of, institutional, theory, john, meyer, and, brian, rowan, were, the, first, scholars, to, introduce, institutional, theory, to, inspect, how, organizations, are, shaped, by, their, social, and, political, environments, and, how, they, evolve, in, different, ways, other, scholars, like, paul, dimaggio, and, walter, powell, proposed, one, of, the, forms, of, institutional, change, shortly, after, institutional, isomorphism, there, were, three, main, proposals, the, first, one, is, the, coercive, process, where, organizations, adopt, changes, consistent, with, their, larger, institution, due, to, pressures, from, other, organizations, which, they, might, depend, on, or, be, regulated, by, such, examples, include, state, mandates, or, supplier, demands, the, second, one, is, the, mimetic, process, where, organizations, adopt, other, organizations, practices, to, resolve, internal, uncertainty, about, their, own, actions, or, strategy, lastly, it, is, the, normative, pressure, where, organizations, adopt, changes, related, to, the, professional, environment, like, corporate, changes, or, cultural, changes, in, order, to, be, consistent, in, order, to, understand, why, some, institutions, persist, and, other, institutions, only, appear, in, certain, contexts, it, is, important, to, understand, what, drives, institutional, change, acemoglu, johnson, and, robinson, assert, that, institutional, change, is, endogenous, they, posit, a, framework, for, institutional, change, that, is, rooted, in, the, distribution, of, resources, across, society, and, preexisting, political, institutions, these, two, factors, determine, de, jure, and, de, facto, political, power, respectively, which, in, turn, defines, this, period, s, economic, institutions, and, the, next, period, s, political, institutions, finally, the, current, economic, institutions, determine, next, period, s, distribution, of, resources, and, the, cycle, repeats, douglass, north, attributes, institutional, change, to, the, work, of, political, entrepreneurs, who, see, personal, opportunities, to, be, derived, from, a, changed, institutional, framework, these, entrepreneurs, weigh, the, expected, costs, of, altering, the, institutional, framework, against, the, benefits, they, can, derive, from, the, change, north, describes, the, institutional, change, as, a, process, that, is, extremely, incremental, and, that, works, through, both, formal, and, informal, institutions, north, also, proposes, that, institutional, change, inefficiencies, and, economic, stagnation, can, be, attributed, to, the, differences, between, institutions, and, organizations, this, is, because, organizations, are, created, to, take, advantage, of, the, opportunities, created, by, institutions, and, as, organizations, evolve, these, institutions, are, then, altered, overall, according, to, north, this, institutional, change, would, then, be, shaped, by, a, lock, in, symbiotic, relationship, between, institutions, and, organizations, and, a, feedback, process, by, which, the, people, in, a, society, may, perceive, and, react, to, these, changes, lipscomb, argues, that, patterns, of, institutional, change, vary, according, to, underlying, characteristics, of, issue, areas, such, as, network, effects, north, also, offers, an, efficiency, hypothesis, stating, that, relative, price, changes, create, incentives, to, create, more, efficient, institutions, it, is, a, utilitarian, argument, that, assumes, institutions, will, evolve, to, maximize, overall, welfare, for, economic, efficiency, contrastingly, in, variation, in, institutional, strength, levitksy, and, murillo, acknowledge, that, some, formal, institutions, are, born, weak, and, attribute, this, to, the, actors, creating, them, they, argue, that, the, strength, of, institutions, relies, on, the, enforcement, of, laws, and, stability, which, many, actors, are, either, uninterested, in, or, incapable, of, supporting, similarly, brian, arthur, refers, to, these, factors, as, properties, of, non, predictability, and, potential, inefficiency, in, matters, where, increasing, returns, occur, naturally, in, economics, according, to, mansfield, and, snyder, many, transitional, democracies, lack, state, institutions, that, are, strong, and, coherent, enough, to, regulate, mass, political, competition, according, to, huntington, the, countries, with, ineffective, or, weak, institutions, often, have, a, gap, between, high, levels, of, political, participation, and, weak, political, institutions, which, may, provoke, nationalism, in, democratizing, countries, regardless, of, whether, the, lack, of, enforcement, and, stability, in, institutions, is, intentional, or, not, weakly, enforced, institutions, can, create, lasting, ripples, in, a, society, and, their, way, of, functioning, good, enforcement, of, laws, can, be, classified, as, a, system, of, rules, that, are, complied, with, in, practice, and, has, a, high, risk, of, punishment, it, is, essential, because, it, will, create, a, slippery, slope, effect, on, most, laws, and, transform, the, nature, of, once, effective, institutions, many, may, identify, the, creation, of, these, formal, institutions, as, a, fitting, way, for, agents, to, establish, legitimacy, in, an, international, or, domestic, domain, a, phenomenon, identified, by, dimaggio, and, powell, and, meyer, and, rowan, as, isomorphism, and, that, levitsky, and, murillo, liken, to, window, dressing, they, describe, the, developing, world, institutions, as, window, dressing, institutions, that, are, often, a, response, to, international, demands, or, expectations, it, also, provides, an, effective, metaphor, for, something, that, power, holders, have, an, interest, in, keeping, on, the, books, but, no, interest, in, enforcing, the, dependence, developing, countries, have, on, international, assistance, for, loans, or, political, power, creates, incentives, for, state, elites, to, establish, a, superficial, form, of, western, government, but, with, malfunctioning, institutions, in, a, 2020, study, johannes, gerschewski, created, a, two, by, two, typology, of, institutional, change, depending, on, the, sources, of, change, exogenous, or, endogenous, and, the, time, horizon, of, change, short, or, long, in, another, 2020, study, erik, voeten, created, a, two, by, two, typology, of, institutional, design, depending, on, whether, actors, have, full, agency, or, are, bound, by, structures, and, whether, institutional, designs, reflect, historical, processes, or, are, optimal, equilibriums, institutions, and, economic, development, in, the, context, of, institutions, and, how, they, are, formed, north, suggests, that, institutions, ultimately, work, to, provide, social, structure, in, society, and, to, incentivize, individuals, who, abide, by, this, structure, north, explains, that, there, is, in, fact, a, difference, between, institutions, and, organizations, and, that, organizations, are, groups, of, people, bound, by, some, common, purpose, to, achieve, objectives, additionally, because, institutions, serve, as, an, umbrella, for, smaller, groups, such, as, organizations, north, discusses, the, impact, of, institutional, change, and, the, ways, in, which, it, can, cause, economic, performance, to, decline, or, become, better, depending, on, the, occurrence, this, is, known, as, path, dependence, which, north, explains, is, the, idea, of, historical, and, cultural, events, impacting, the, development, of, institutions, over, time, even, though, north, argues, that, institutions, due, to, their, structure, do, not, possess, the, ability, to, change, drastically, path, dependence, and, small, differences, have, the, ability, to, cause, change, over, a, long, period, of, time, for, example, levitsky, and, murillo, stress, the, importance, of, institutional, strength, in, their, article, variation, in, institutional, strength, they, suggest, that, in, order, for, an, institution, to, maintain, strength, and, resistance, there, must, be, legitimacy, within, the, different, political, regimes, variation, in, political, power, and, political, autonomy, within, a, country, legitimacy, allows, for, there, to, be, an, incentive, to, comply, with, institutional, rules, and, conditions, leading, to, a, more, effective, institution, with, political, power, its, centralization, within, a, small, group, of, individual, leaders, makes, it, easier, and, more, effective, to, create, rules, and, run, an, institution, smoothly, however, it, can, be, abused, by, individual, leaders, which, is, something, that, can, contribute, to, the, weakening, of, an, institution, over, time, lastly, independence, within, an, institution, is, vital, because, the, institutions, are, making, decisions, based, on, expertise, and, norms, that, they, have, created, and, built, over, time, rather, than, considerations, from, other, groups, or, institutions, having, the, ability, to, operate, as, an, independent, institution, is, crucial, for, its, strength, and, resistance, over, time, an, example, of, the, importance, of, institutional, strength, can, be, found, in, lacatus, essay, on, national, human, rights, institutions, in, europe, where, she, states, that, as, countries, become, members, of, ganhri, their, nhris, are, more, likely, to, become, stronger, over, time, and, show, a, general, pattern, of, isomorphism, regarding, stronger, safeguards, for, durability, this, demonstrates, that, institutions, running, independently, and, further, creating, spaces, for, the, formation, of, smaller, groups, with, other, goals, and, objectives, is, crucial, for, an, institution, s, survival, additionally, technological, developments, are, important, in, the, economic, development, of, an, institution, as, detailed, by, brian, arthur, in, competing, technologies, increasing, returns, and, lock, in, by, historical, events, technological, advancements, play, a, crucial, role, in, shaping, the, economic, stability, of, an, institution, he, talks, about, the, lock, in, phenomenon, in, which, adds, a, lot, of, value, to, a, piece, of, technology, that, is, used, by, many, people, it, is, important, for, policymakers, and, people, of, higher, levels, within, an, institution, to, consider, when, looking, at, products, that, have, a, long, term, impact, on, markets, and, economic, developments, and, stability, for, example, recently, the, eu, has, banned, tiktok, from, official, devices, across, all, three, government, institutions, this, was, due, to, cybersecurity, concerns, and, data, protection, in, regards, to, data, collection, by, third, parties, this, concern, regarding, tiktok, s, growing, popularity, demonstrates, the, importance, of, technological, development, within, an, institutional, economy, without, understanding, of, what, these, products, are, doing, or, selling, to, the, consumers, there, runs, a, risk, of, it, weakening, an, institution, and, causing, more, harm, than, good, if, not, carefully, considered, and, examined, by, the, individual, actors, within, an, institution, this, can, also, be, seen, in, the, recent, issue, with, silvergate, and, money, being, moved, to, crypto, exchanges, under, the, sen, platform, institution, which, has, led, the, bank, to, delay, the, filing, of, its, annual, report, due, to, questions, from, its, auditors, additionally, they, lost, many, crypto, clients, the, next, day, allowing, the, bank, s, stock, price, to, fall, by, 60, before, it, stabilized, again, these, examples, demonstrate, the, ways, in, which, institutions, and, the, economy, interact, and, how, the, well, being, of, the, economy, is, essential, for, the, institution, s, success, and, ability, to, run, smoothly, north, argues, that, because, of, the, preexisting, influence, that, existing, organizations, have, over, the, existing, framework, change, that, is, brought, about, is, often, in, the, interests, of, these, organizations, this, is, because, organizations, are, created, to, take, advantage, of, such, opportunities, and, as, organizations, evolve, these, institutions, are, altered, this, produces, a, phenomenon, called, path, dependence, which, states, that, institutional, patterns, are, persistent, and, endure, over, time, these, paths, are, determined, at, critical, junctures, analogous, to, a, fork, in, the, road, whose, outcome, leads, to, a, narrowing, of, possible, future, outcomes, once, a, choice, is, made, during, a, critical, juncture, it, becomes, progressively, difficult, to, return, to, the, initial, point, where, the, choice, was, made, james, mahoney, studies, path, dependence, in, the, context, of, national, regime, change, in, central, america, and, finds, that, liberal, policy, choices, of, central, american, leaders, in, the, 19th, century, was, the, critical, juncture, that, led, to, the, divergent, levels, of, development, that, we, see, in, these, countries, today, the, policy, choices, that, leaders, made, in, the, context, of, liberal, reform, policy, led, to, a, variety, of, self, reinforcing, institutions, that, created, divergent, development, outcomes, for, the, central, american, countries, though, institutions, are, persistent, north, states, that, paths, can, change, course, when, external, forces, weaken, the, power, of, an, existing, organization, this, allows, other, entrepreneurs, to, affect, change, in, the, institutional, framework, this, change, can, also, occur, as, a, result, of, gridlock, between, political, actors, produced, by, a, lack, of, mediating, institutions, and, an, inability, to, reach, a, bargain, artificial, implementation, of, institutional, change, has, been, tested, in, political, development, but, can, have, unintended, consequences, north, wallis, and, weingast, divide, societies, into, different, social, orders, open, access, orders, which, about, a, dozen, developed, countries, fall, into, today, and, limited, access, orders, which, accounts, for, the, rest, of, the, countries, open, access, orders, and, limited, access, orders, differ, fundamentally, in, the, way, power, and, influence, is, distributed, as, a, result, open, access, institutions, placed, in, limited, access, orders, face, limited, success, and, are, often, coopted, by, the, powerful, elite, for, self, enrichment, transition, to, more, democratic, institutions, is, not, created, simply, by, transplanting, these, institutions, into, new, contexts, but, happens, when, it, is, in, the, interest, of, the, dominant, coalition, to, widen, access, ian, lustick, suggests, that, the, social, sciences, particularly, those, with, the, institution, as, a, central, concept, can, benefit, by, applying, the, concept, of, natural, selection, to, the, study, of, how, institutions, change, over, time, by, viewing, institutions, as, existing, within, a, fitness, landscape, lustick, argues, that, the, gradual, improvements, typical, of, many, institutions, can, be, seen, as, analogous, to, hill, climbing, within, one, of, these, fitness, landscapes, this, can, eventually, lead, to, institutions, becoming, stuck, on, local, maxima, such, that, for, the, institution, to, improve, any, further, it, would, first, need, to, decrease, its, overall, fitness, score, e, g, adopt, policies, that, may, cause, short, term, harm, to, the, institution, s, members, the, tendency, to, get, stuck, on, local, maxima, can, explain, why, certain, types, of, institutions, may, continue, to, have, policies, that, are, harmful, to, its, members, or, to, the, institution, itself, even, when, members, and, leadership, are, all, aware, of, the, faults, of, these, policies, as, an, example, lustick, cites, amyx, s, analysis, of, the, gradual, rise, of, the, japanese, economy, and, its, seemingly, sudden, reversal, in, the, so, called, lost, decade, according, to, amyx, japanese, experts, were, not, unaware, of, the, possible, causes, of, japan, s, economic, decline, rather, to, return, japan, s, economy, back, to, the, path, to, economic, prosperity, policymakers, would, have, had, to, adopt, policies, that, would, first, cause, short, term, harm, to, the, japanese, people, and, government, under, this, analysis, says, ian, lustick, japan, was, stuck, on, a, local, maxima, which, it, arrived, at, through, gradual, increases, in, its, fitness, level, set, by, the, economic, landscape, of, the, 1970s, and, 80s, without, an, accompanying, change, in, institutional, flexibility, japan, was, unable, to, adapt, to, changing, conditions, and, even, though, experts, may, have, known, which, changes, the, country, needed, they, would, have, been, virtually, powerless, to, enact, those, changes, without, instituting, unpopular, policies, that, would, have, been, harmful, in, the, short, term, the, lessons, from, lustick, s, analysis, applied, to, sweden, s, economic, situation, can, similarly, apply, to, the, political, gridlock, that, often, characterizes, politics, in, the, united, states, for, example, lustick, observes, that, any, politician, who, hopes, to, run, for, elected, office, stands, very, little, to, no, chance, if, they, enact, policies, that, show, no, short, term, results, there, is, a, mismatch, between, policies, that, bring, about, short, term, benefits, with, minimal, sacrifice, and, those, that, bring, about, long, lasting, change, by, encouraging, institution, level, adaptations, there, are, some, criticisms, to, lustick, s, application, of, natural, selection, theory, to, institutional, change, lustick, himself, notes, that, identifying, the, inability, of, institutions, to, adapt, as, a, symptom, of, being, stuck, on, a, local, maxima, within, a, fitness, landscape, does, nothing, to, solve, the, problem, at, the, very, least, however, it, might, add, credibility, to, the, idea, that, truly, beneficial, change, might, require, short, term, harm, to, institutions, and, their, members, david, sloan, wilson, notes, that, lustick, needs, to, more, carefully, distinguish, between, two, concepts, multilevel, selection, theory, and, evolution, on, multi, peaked, landscapes, bradley, thayer, points, out, that, the, concept, of, a, fitness, landscape, and, local, maxima, only, makes, sense, if, one, institution, can, be, said, to, be, better, than, another, and, this, in, turn, only, makes, sense, insofar, as, there, exists, some, objective, measure, of, an, institution, s, quality, this, may, be, relatively, simple, in, evaluating, the, economic, prosperity, of, a, society, for, example, but, it, is, difficult, to, see, how, objectively, a, measure, can, be, applied, to, the, amount, of, freedom, of, a, society, or, the, quality, of, life, of, the, individuals, within, the, term, institutionalization, is, widely, used, in, social, theory, to, refer, to, the, process, of, embedding, something, for, example, a, concept, a, social, role, a, particular, value, or, mode, of, behavior, within, an, organization, social, system, or, society, as, a, whole, the, term, may, also, be, used, to, refer, to, committing, a, particular, individual, to, an, institution, such, as, a, mental, institution, to, this, extent, institutionalization, may, carry, negative, connotations, regarding, the, treatment, of, and, damage, caused, to, vulnerable, human, beings, by, the, oppressive, or, corrupt, application, of, inflexible, systems, of, social, medical, or, legal, controls, by, publicly, owned, private, or, not, for, profit, organizations, the, term, institutionalization, may, also, be, used, in, a, political, sense, to, apply, to, the, creation, or, organization, of, governmental, institutions, or, particular, bodies, responsible, for, overseeing, or, implementing, policy, for, example, in, the, welfare, or, development
