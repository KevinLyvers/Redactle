targeting, requires, public, relations, professionals, to, have, a, deep, understanding, of, the, needs, and, desires, of, the, audience, they, are, trying, to, appeal, to, sometimes, the, interests, of, differing, audiences, and, stakeholders, common, to, a, public, relations, effort, necessitate, the, creation, of, several, distinct, but, complementary, messages, these, messages, however, should, be, relevant, to, each, other, thus, creating, consistency, in, the, overall, message, and, theme, audience, targeting, tactics, are, important, for, public, relations, practitioners, because, they, face, all, kinds, of, problems, low, visibility, lack, of, public, understanding, opposition, from, critics, and, insufficient, support, from, funding, sources, on, the, other, hand,
