asia, europe, east, asia, europe, indo, aryan, iranian, indo, aryan, iranian, others, european, the, indo, aryan, languages, or, sometimes, indic, languages, are, a, branch, of, the, indo, iranian, languages, in, the, indo, european, language, family, as, of, the, early, 21st, century, they, have, more, than, 800, million, speakers, primarily, concentrated, east, of, the, indus, river, in, bangladesh, india, pakistan, sri, lanka, maldives, and, nepal, moreover, apart, from, the, indian, subcontinent, large, immigrant, and, expatriate, indo, aryan, speaking, communities, live, in, northwestern, europe, western, asia, north, america, the, caribbean, southeast, africa, polynesia, and, australia, along, with, several, million, speakers, of, romani, languages, primarily, concentrated, in, southeastern, europe, there, are, over, 200, known, indo, aryan, languages, modern, indo, aryan, languages, descend, from, old, indo, aryan, languages, such, as, early, vedic, sanskrit, through, middle, indo, aryan, languages, or, prakrits, the, largest, such, languages, in, terms, of, first, speakers, are, hindi, urdu, c, 330, million, bengali, 242, million, punjabi, about, 150, million, marathi, 112, million, and, gujarati, 60, million, a, 2005, estimate, placed, the, total, number, of, native, speakers, of, the, indo, aryan, languages, at, nearly, 900, million, people, other, estimates, are, higher, suggesting, a, figure, of, 1, 5, billion, speakers, of, indo, aryan, languages, the, indo, aryan, family, as, a, whole, is, thought, to, represent, a, dialect, continuum, where, languages, are, often, transitional, towards, neighboring, varieties, because, of, this, the, division, into, languages, vs, dialects, is, in, many, cases, somewhat, arbitrary, the, classification, of, the, indo, aryan, languages, is, controversial, with, many, transitional, areas, that, are, assigned, to, different, branches, depending, on, classification, there, are, concerns, that, a, tree, model, is, insufficient, for, explaining, the, development, of, new, indo, aryan, with, some, scholars, suggesting, the, wave, model, the, following, table, of, proposals, is, expanded, from, masica, 1991, from, hoernl, to, turner, and, also, includes, subsequent, classification, proposals, the, table, lists, only, some, modern, indo, aryan, languages, anton, i, kogan, in, 2016, conducted, a, lexicostatistical, study, of, the, new, indo, aryan, languages, based, on, a, 100, word, swadesh, list, using, techniques, developed, by, the, glottochronologist, and, comparative, linguist, sergei, starostin, that, grouping, system, is, notable, for, kogan, s, exclusion, of, dardic, from, indo, aryan, on, the, basis, of, his, previous, studies, showing, low, lexical, similarity, to, indo, aryan, 43, 5, and, negligible, difference, with, similarity, to, iranian, 39, 3, he, also, calculated, sinhala, dhivehi, to, be, the, most, divergent, indo, aryan, branch, nevertheless, the, modern, consensus, of, indo, aryan, linguists, tends, towards, the, inclusion, of, dardic, based, on, morphological, and, grammatical, features, the, inner, outer, hypothesis, argues, for, a, core, and, periphery, of, indo, aryan, languages, with, outer, indo, aryan, generally, including, eastern, and, southern, indo, aryan, and, sometimes, northwestern, indo, aryan, dardic, and, pahari, representing, an, older, stratum, of, old, indo, aryan, that, has, been, mixed, to, varying, degrees, with, the, newer, stratum, that, is, inner, indo, aryan, it, is, a, contentious, proposal, with, a, long, history, with, varying, degrees, of, claimed, phonological, and, morphological, evidence, since, its, proposal, by, rudolf, hoernl, in, 1880, and, refinement, by, george, grierson, it, has, undergone, numerous, revisions, and, a, great, deal, of, debate, with, the, most, recent, iteration, by, franklin, southworth, and, claus, peter, zoller, based, on, robust, linguistic, evidence, particularly, an, outer, past, tense, in, l, some, of, the, theory, s, skeptics, include, suniti, kumar, chatterji, and, colin, p, masica, the, below, classification, follows,

spoken, in, the, northwestern, extremities, of, the, indian, subcontinent, dardic, was, first, formulated, by, george, abraham, grierson, in, his, linguistic, survey, of, india, but, he, did, not, consider, it, to, be, a, subfamily, of, indo, aryan, the, dardic, group, as, a, genetic, grouping, rather, than, areal, has, been, scrutinised, and, questioned, to, a, degree, by, recent, scholarship, southworth, for, example, says, the, viability, of, dardic, as, a, genuine, subgroup, of, indo, aryan, is, doubtful, and, the, similarities, among, may, result, from, subsequent, convergence, 149, the, dardic, languages, are, thought, to, be, transitional, with, punjabi, and, pahari, e, g, zoller, describes, kashmiri, as, an, interlink, between, dardic, and, west, pah, 83, as, well, as, non,

suggested, that, proto, munda, languages, may, have, once, dominated, the, eastern, indo, gangetic, plain, and, were, then, absorbed, by, indo, aryan, languages, at, an, early, date, as, indo, aryan, spread, east, marathi, konkani, languages, are, ultimately, descended, from, maharashtri, prakrit, whereas, insular, indo, aryan, languages, are, descended, from, elu, prakrit, and, possess, several,

apparently, indo, aryan, names, suggest, that, an, indo, aryan, elite, imposed, itself, over, the, hurrians, in, the, course, of, the, indo, aryan, expansion, if, these, traces, are, indo, aryan, they, would, be, the, earliest, known, direct, evidence, of, indo, aryan, and, would, increase, the, precision, in, dating, the, split, between, the, indo, aryan, and, iranian, languages, as, the,

ravakac, ra, of, devasena, dated, to, the, 930s, is, now, considered, to, be, the, first, hindi, book, the, next, major, milestone, occurred, with, the, muslim, conquests, in, the, indian, subcontinent, in, the, 13th, 16th, centuries, under, the, flourishing, turco, mongol, mughal, empire, persian, became, very, influential, as, the, language, of, prestige, of, the, islamic, courts, due, to, adoption, of, the, foreign, language, by, the, mughal, emperors, the, two, largest, languages, that, formed, from, apabhra, a, were, bengali, and, hindustani, others, include, assamese, sindhi, gujarati, odia, marathi, and, punjabi, in, the, central, zone, hindi, speaking, areas, for, a, long, time, the, prestige, dialect, was, braj, bhasha, but, this, was, replaced, in, the, 19th, century, by, dehlavi, based, hindustani, hindustani, was, strongly, influenced, by, persian, with, these, and, later, sanskrit, influence, leading, to, the, emergence, of, modern, standard, hindi, and, modern, standard, urdu, as, registers, of, the, hindustani, language, this, state, of, affairs, continued, until, the, division, of, the, british, indian, empire, in, 1947, when, hindi, became, the, official, language, in, india, and, urdu, became, official, in, pakistan, despite, the, different, script, the, fundamental, grammar, remains, identical, the, difference, is, more, sociolinguistic, than, purely, linguistic, today, it, is, widely, understood, spoken, as, a, second, or, third, language, throughout, south, asia, and, one, of, the, most, widely, known, languages, in, the, world, in, terms, of, number, of, speakers, domari, is, an, indo, aryan, language, spoken, by, older, dom, people, scattered, across, the, middle, east, the, language, is, reported, to, be, spoken, as, far, north, as, azerbaijan, and, as, far, south, as, central, sudan, 1, based, on, the, systematicity, of, sound, changes, linguists, have, concluded, that, the, ethnonyms, domari, and, romani, derive, from, the, indo, aryan, word, om, lomavren, is, a, nearly, extinct, mixed, language, spoken, by, the, lom, people, that, arose, from, language, contact, between, a, language, related, to, romani, and, domari, and, the, armenian, language, parya, is, spoken, in, tajikistan, and, uzbekistan, by, the, descendants, of, migrants, from, the, indian, subcontinent, the, language, retains, many, features, similar, to, punjabi, and, the, western, hindi, dialects, while, also, bearing, some, influence, from, tajik, persian, the, romani, language, is, usually, included, in, the, western, indo, aryan, languages, romani, varieties, which, are, mainly, spoken, throughout, europe, are, noted, for, their, relatively, conservative, nature, maintaining, the, middle, indo, aryan, present, tense, person, concord, markers, alongside, consonantal, endings, for, nominal, case, indeed, these, features, are, no, longer, evident, in, most, other, modern, central, indo, aryan, languages, moreover, romani, shares, an, innovative, pattern, of, past, tense, person, which, corresponds, to, dardic, languages, such, as, kashmiri, and, shina, this, is, believed, to, be, further, indication, that, proto, romani, speakers, were, originally, situated, in, central, regions, of, the, subcontinent, before, migrating, to, northwestern, regions, however, there, are, no, known, historical, sources, regarding, the, development, of, the, romani, language, specifically, within, india, research, conducted, by, nineteenth, century, scholars, pott, 1845, and, miklosich, 1882, 1888, demonstrated, that, the, romani, language, is, most, aptly, designated, as, a, new, indo, aryan, language, nia, as, opposed, to, middle, indo, aryan, mia, establishing, that, proto, romani, speakers, could, not, have, left, india, significantly, earlier, than, ad, 1000, the, principal, argument, favouring, a, migration, during, or, after, the, transition, period, to, nia, is, the, loss, of, the, old, system, of, nominal, case, coupled, with, its, reduction, to, a, two, way, nominative, oblique, case, system, a, secondary, argument, concerns, the, system, of, gender, differentiation, due, to, the, fact, that, romani, has, only, two, genders, masculine, and, feminine, middle, indo, aryan, languages, named, mia, generally, employed, three, genders, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, and, some, modern, indo, aryan, languages, retain, this, aspect, today, it, is, suggested, that, loss, of, the, neuter, gender, did, not, occur, until, the, transition, to, nia, during, this, process, most, of, the, neuter, nouns, became, masculine, while, several, became, feminine, for, example, the, neuter, aggi, fire, in, prakrit, morphed, into, the, feminine, g, in, hindi, and, jag, in, romani, the, parallels, in, grammatical, gender, evolution, between, romani, and, other, nia, languages, have, additionally, been, cited, as, indications, that, the, forerunner, of, romani, remained, on, the, indian, subcontinent, until, a, later, period, possibly, as, late, as, the, tenth, century, kholosi, jadgali, and, luwati, represent, offshoots, of, the, sindhic, subfamily, of, indo, aryan, that, have, established, themselves, in, the, persian, gulf, region, perhaps, through, sea, based, migrations, these, are, of, a, later, origin, than, the, rom, and, dom, migrations, which, represent, a, different, part, of, indo, aryan, as, well, the, use, by, the, british, east, india, company, of, indentured, labourers, led, to, the, transplanting, of, indo, aryan, languages, around, the, world, leading, to, locally, influenced, lects, that, diverged, from, the, source, language, such, as, fiji, hindi, and, caribbean, hindustani, the, normative, system, of, new, indo, aryan, stops, consists, of, five, places, of, articulation, labial, dental, retroflex, palatal, and, velar, which, is, the, same, as, that, of, sanskrit, the, retroflex, position, may, involve, retroflexion, or, curling, the, tongue, to, make, the, contact, with, the, underside, of, the, tip, or, merely, retraction, the, point, of, contact, may, be, alveolar, or, postalveolar, and, the, distinctive, quality, may, arise, more, from, the, shaping, than, from, the, position, of, the, tongue, palatal, stops, have, affricated, release, and, are, traditionally, included, as, involving, a, distinctive, tongue, position, blade, in, contact, with, hard, palate, widely, transcribed, as, masica, 1991, 94, claims, to, be, a, more, accurate, rendering, moving, away, from, the, normative, system, some, languages, and, dialects, have, alveolar, affricates, instead, of, palatal, though, some, among, them, retain, in, certain, positions, before, front, vowels, esp, i, before, j, or, when, geminated, alveolar, as, an, additional, point, of, articulation, occurs, in, marathi, and, konkani, where, dialect, mixture, and, others, factors, upset, the, aforementioned, complementation, to, produce, minimal, environments, in, some, west, pahari, dialects, through, internal, developments, t, t, t, and, in, kashmiri, the, addition, of, a, retroflex, affricate, to, this, in, some, dardic, languages, maxes, out, the, number, of, stop, positions, at, seven, barring, borrowed, q, while, a, reduction, to, the, inventory, involves, ts, s, which, has, happened, in, assamese, chittagonian, sinhala, though, there, have, been, other, sources, of, a, secondary, ts, and, southern, mewari, further, reductions, in, the, number, of, stop, articulations, are, in, assamese, and, romani, which, have, lost, the, characteristic, dental, retroflex, contrast, and, in, chittagonian, which, may, lose, its, labial, and, velar, articulations, through, spirantisation, in, many, positions, q, x, f, are, restricted, to, perso, arabic, loanwords, in, most, ia, languages, but, they, occur, natively, in, khowar, according, to, masica, 1991, some, dialects, of, pashayi, have, a, which, is, unusual, for, ia, languages, domari, which, is, spoken, in, the, middle, east, and, had, high, contact, with, middle, eastern, languages, has, q, and, emphatic, consonants, from, loanwords, sanskrit, was, noted, as, having, five, nasal, stop, articulations, corresponding, to, its, oral, stops, and, among, modern, languages, and, dialects, dogri, kacchi, kalasha, rudhari, shina, saurashtri, and, sindhi, have, been, analysed, as, having, this, full, complement, of, phonemic, nasals, m, n, with, the, last, two, generally, as, the, result, of, the, loss, of, the, stop, from, a, homorganic, nasal, stop, cluster, and, though, there, are, other, sources, as, well, in, languages, that, lack, phonemic, nasals, at, some, places, of, articulation, they, can, still, occur, allophonically, from, place, assimilation, in, a, nasal, stop, culture, e, g, hindi, n, most, indo, aryan, languages, have, contrastive, aspiration, and, some, retain, historical, breathy, voice, on, voiced, consonants, sometimes, both, phenomena, are, analysed, as, a, single, aspiration, contrast, the, places, and, manners, of, articulation, which, allow, contrastive, aspiration, vary, by, language, e, g, sindhi, permits, phonemic, m, but, the, phonemic, status, of, this, sound, in, hindi, is, uncertain, and, many, dardic, languages, lack, aspirated, retroflex, sibilants, despite, having, unaspirated, equivalents, in, languages, that, have, lost, breathy, voice, the, contrast, has, often, been, replaced, with, tone, some, of, these, are, mentioned, in, masica, 1991, 104, 105, vowel, typologies, are, varied, across, indo, aryan, due, to, diachronic, mergers, and, in, some, cases, splits, as, well, as, different, accounts, by, linguists, for, even, the, widely, spoken, languages, vowel, systems, per, masica, 1991, 108, 113, are, listed, below, many, languages, also, have, phonemic, nasal, vowels, sylheti, language, is, one, of, the, few, tonal, indo, aryan, languages, others, being, punjabi, and, a, few, dardic, languages, the, vowels, of, sylheti, language, listed, below, the, following, are, consonant, systems, of, major, and, representative, new, indo, aryan, languages,

functional, load, the, arrangement, is, roughly, geographical, in, many, indo, aryan, languages, the, literary, register, is, often, more, archaic, and, utilises, a, different, lexicon, sanskrit, or,
