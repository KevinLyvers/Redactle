2024, the, university, of, tokyo, traces, its, roots, to, three, independent, institutes, founded, during, the, edo, period, 1603, 1868, the, oldest, a, shogun, funded, confucian, school, called, senseiden, was, founded, in, 1630, by, razan, hayashi, in, ueno, this, school, was, renamed, the, shoheizaka, institute, shoheizaka, gakumonjo, and, came, to, be, operated, directly, by, the, tokugawa, shogunate, in, 1791, as, part, of, the, kansei, reforms, the, tenmongata, established, in, 1684, was, the, astronomical, research, and, education, arm, of, the, shogunate, it, evolved, into, the, kaisei, school, a, school, for, western, learnings, after, the, meiji, restoration, the, kanda, otamagaike, vaccination, centre, established, in, 1858, evolved, into, a, school, of, western, medicine, called, tokyo, medical, school, tokyo, igakko, although, plans, to, establish, the, country, s, first, university, had, been, in, place, just, after, the, meiji, restoration, it, was, not, until, around, 1875, that, it, was, decided, to, form, the, university, by, merging, these, schools, the, university, of, tokyo, was, chartered, on, 12, april, 1877, by, the, meiji, government, corresponding, to, the, fields, covered, by, the, predecessor, schools, it, started, with, four, faculties, law, science, letters, and, medicine, the, imperial, college, of, engineering, later, merged, into, the, university, and, became, the, faculty, of, engineering, in, 1886, the, university, was, renamed, imperial, university, and, it, adopted, the, name, tokyo, imperial, university, in, 1897, after, the, founding, of, the, next, imperial, university, what, is, now, kyoto, university, by, 1888, all, faculties, had, completed, their, relocation, to, the, former, site, of, the, tokyo, house, of, the, maeda, family, in, hongo, where, they, continue, to, operate, today, among, the, few, extant, structures, built, before, this, relocation, is, a, gate, called, akamon, which, has, become, a, widely, recognised, symbol, of, the, university, during, its, initial, two, decades, as, a, modern, institution, utokyo, greatly, benefited, from, the, contributions, of, european, and, american, scholars, in, 1871, the, meiji, government, made, a, decision, about, the, direction, of, academic, disciplines, engineering, was, to, be, learnt, from, the, united, kingdom, mathematics, physics, and, international, law, from, france, while, politics, economics, and, medicine, were, to, be, guided, by, german, expertise, additionally, agriculture, and, commercial, law, knowledge, was, to, be, sourced, from, the, united, states, following, this, policy, utokyo, and, its, predecessor, institutions, sent, their, graduates, to, universities, in, these, respective, countries, and, also, invited, lecturers, from, them, however, by, the, 1880s, the, japanese, government, grew, concerned, over, the, spread, of, french, republican, and, british, constitutional, monarchist, ideals, among, the, faculty, and, students, so, minister, of, education, takato, oki, instructed, the, university, to, reduce, the, use, of, english, as, a, language, of, instruction, and, instead, to, switch, to, japanese, this, shift, coincided, with, the, return, of, utokyo, alumni, who, had, completed, their, education, in, europe, and, these, returnees, began, filling, roles, that, had, been, predominantly, held, by, foreign, scholars, on, 1, september, 1923, the, great, kanto, earthquake, struck, the, kanto, plain, inflicting, immense, damage, upon, the, university, this, damage, included, the, complete, destruction, of, almost, all, main, buildings, including, the, library, as, well, as, the, loss, of, precious, scientific, and, historical, samples, and, data, stored, in, them, this, led, to, a, university, wide, debate, as, to, whether, it, should, relocate, to, a, larger, site, such, as, yoyogi, but, ultimately, such, plans, were, rejected, instead, the, university, purchased, additional, land, in, its, vicinity, which, was, still, owned, by, the, maeda, family, and, expanded, there, the, reconstruction, of, the, university, and, its, library, was, brought, up, in, the, fourth, general, assembly, of, the, league, of, nations, in, september, 1923, where, it, was, unanimously, decided, to, provide, support, the, league, is, said, to, have, been, sympathetic, especially, because, the, memory, of, the, destruction, of, ku, leuven, in, belgium, during, the, first, world, war, was, still, fresh, the, american, philanthropist, john, d, rockefeller, jr, personally, donated, 2, million, approximately, 36, million, in, 2023, the, united, kingdom, formed, a, committee, led, by, former, prime, minister, earl, arthur, balfour, and, made, substantial, financial, and, cultural, contributions, a, large, portion, of, the, buildings, on, hongo, campus, today, were, built, during, this, reconstruction, period, and, their, unique, collegiate, gothic, style, is, known, as, uchida, gothic, after, yoshikazu, uchida, the, architect, who, designed, them, another, notable, change, the, earthquake, brought, about, at, the, university, was, the, expansion, of, its, seismology, studies, long, having, been, the, only, university, in, the, seismically, active, country, the, university, was, already, known, for, its, seismology, research, most, notably, the, contributions, made, by, its, alumnus, and, professor, fusakichi, omori, in, quantitatively, evaluating, the, aftershocks, of, earthquakes, omori, s, law, and, developing, a, new, type, of, seismometer, capable, of, recording, primary, waves, the, university, set, up, an, independent, seismology, department, in, november, 1923, to, delve, deeply, into, the, causes, and, effects, of, earthquakes, and, to, better, prepare, for, future, seismic, events, in, 1925, with, a, government, grant, the, earthquake, research, institute, was, established, within, the, university, and, it, has, been, in, continuous, operation, up, to, today, in, 1941, the, empire, of, japan, attacked, the, american, bases, at, pearl, harbor, and, joined, the, world, war, ii, as, an, axis, power, alongside, germany, by, late, 1943, as, japan, faced, significant, defeats, in, the, pacific, theatre, a, decision, was, made, to, enlist, university, students, studying, humanities, sending, them, to, battlefields, during, the, war, 1, 652, students, and, alumni, of, utokyo, were, killed, including, those, from, varied, civilian, professions, such, as, doctors, engineers, and, diplomats, as, well, as, those, killed, in, action, they, are, commemorated, in, a, memorial, erected, near, the, front, gate, of, the, hongo, campus, most, students, from, faculties, of, engineering, and, science, remained, at, university, or, worked, as, apprentice, engineers, as, the, expertise, of, science, and, technology, was, deemed, indispensable, for, the, war, effort, leo, esaki, who, was, a, student, at, the, department, of, physics, during, the, war, shared, his, memory, of, his, university, life, in, 2007, the, day, after, the, tokyo, air, raid, of, 9, march, 1945, during, which, more, than, 100, thousand, citizens, were, killed, professor, tanaka, conducted, class, as, usual, without, mentioning, the, war, at, all, the, buildings, and, facilities, of, utokyo, were, largely, immune, from, air, raids, allowing, education, and, research, activities, to, continue, the, increased, demand, brought, about, by, the, war, for, engineers, especially, in, the, fields, of, aeronautics, machinery, electronics, and, shipbuilding, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, second, faculty, of, engineering, at, utokyo, in, 1942, in, the, newly, built, chiba, campus, around, 800, students, were, enrolled, at, one, time, and, pivotal, military, engineering, research, activities, were, conducted, it, was, closed, in, 1951, and, as, a, successor, organisation, the, institute, of, industrial, science, was, established, on, the, site, of, the, former, headquarters, of, the, third, infantry, regiment, in, roppongi, during, the, war, the, imperial, army, attempted, to, use, the, university, s, facilities, several, times, including, plans, to, relocate, the, university, to, sendai, and, use, the, hongo, campus, as, a, fortress, for, the, anticipated, allied, landing, operation, downfall, to, protect, the, imperial, palace, president, yoshikazu, uchida, consistently, denied, these, requests, by, persuading, them, of, the, importance, of, culture, education, and, research, for, the, country, s, long, term, development, in, september, 1945, efforts, by, uchida, and, shigeru, nambara, dean, of, the, faculty, of, law, prevented, the, campus, from, becoming, the, allied, headquarters, instead, the, dai, ichi, seimei, building, was, chosen, nambara, succeeded, uchida, as, president, in, december, 1945, during, the, american, occupation, era, following, japan, s, defeat, in, world, war, ii, the, university, dropped, the, word, imperial, from, its, name, and, reverted, to, its, original, name, university, of, tokyo, during, this, period, japan, s, education, system, was, reformed, to, align, more, with, the, american, system, as, a, result, utokyo, under, merged, with, two, higher, schools, which, were, university, preparatory, boy, s, boarding, schools, and, thus, became, a, four, year, university, as, it, is, today, in, 1949, one, of, the, higher, schools, that, merged, with, utokyo, the, first, higher, school, became, the, college, of, arts, and, sciences, this, new, college, operating, on, the, same, campus, of, komaba, as, the, higher, school, took, on, the, responsibility, of, educating, all, undergraduates, for, the, first, year, and, a, half, of, their, degrees, it, was, also, during, this, period, that, utokyo, first, opened, its, doors, to, female, students, the, first, nineteen, female, students, were, matriculated, in, april, 1946, the, 1960s, saw, an, intensification, of, student, protests, across, the, world, including, the, anti, vietnam, war, protests, and, the, may, 68, events, in, france, this, zeitgeist, of, the, era, was, prominently, felt, in, japan, as, well, symbolised, by, the, 1960, anpo, protests, in, which, the, death, of, a, utokyo, student, michiko, kamba, caused, public, outrage, in, 1968, the, university, of, tokyo, conflict, t, dai, funs, began, with, medical, students, demanding, improvements, in, internship, conditions, in, which, medical, students, were, forced, to, work, long, hours, without, being, paid, before, being, licensed, as, a, doctor, the, conflict, intensified, with, the, indefinite, strike, decision, by, the, students, in, january, 1968, and, escalated, further, following, a, clash, between, the, students, and, faculty, tensions, peaked, when, radical, students, most, of, whom, were, members, of, the, zenky, t, the, all, campus, joint, struggle, committees, occupied, yasuda, auditorium, leading, the, university, to, eventually, call, in, riot, police, in, june, a, move, seen, as, abandoning, university, autonomy, efforts, to, resolve, the, situation, began, with, the, resignation, of, university, executives, and, the, appointment, of, ichiro, kato, as, interim, president, who, started, negotiations, the, conflict, largely, ended, in, january, 1969, after, a, full, scale, police, operation, to, remove, the, occupying, students, this, operation, involved, more, than, 8, 500, riot, police, officers, confronting, students, who, fought, back, with, molotov, cocktails, and, marble, stones, taken, from, the, auditorium, s, interior, prime, minister, eisaku, sato, who, was, an, alumnus, of, utokyo, himself, visited, the, site, the, day, after, the, protesters, in, the, auditorium, were, forcibly, removed, and, decided, to, cancel, that, year, s, admission, process, this, led, top, highschool, students, to, apply, reluctantly, to, other, universities, such, as, kyoto, university, and, hitotsubashi, university, resulting, in, many, applicants, who, would, have, been, admitted, to, those, universities, under, normal, circumstances, failing, to, gain, admission, since, applicants, are, not, allowed, to, apply, to, multiple, prestigious, national, universities, in, japan, the, aftermath, saw, 633, prosecutions, and, varied, sentences, marking, a, turbulent, chapter, in, the, university, s, history, the, university, first, admitted, female, students, in, 1946, while, the, student, body, has, remained, predominantly, male, various, attempts, have, been, made, to, achieve, a, more, equal, gender, ratio, in, 2023, women, made, up, 23, per, cent, of, first, year, undergraduates, the, highest, percentage, in, the, university, s, history, a, quarter, of, graduate, students, were, female, in, 2022, when, the, british, magazine, times, higher, education, first, published, its, world, university, rankings, in, partnership, with, qs, in, 2004, the, university, of, tokyo, was, ranked, 12th, in, the, world, in, the, latest, 2024, edition, of, the, rankings, it, is, ranked, 29th, qs, now, has, its, own, rankings, placed, the, utokyo, at, 28th, as, these, numbers, suggest, there, is, a, widely, shared, concern, that, the, university, is, falling, behind, its, counterparts, in, the, world, and, in, the, future, it, may, struggle, to, provide, a, suitable, environment, for, quality, education, and, world, class, research, utokyo, faces, a, challenging, reality, japan, s, long, lasting, economic, downturn, since, the, 1990s, has, led, to, japanese, companies, less, willing, to, invest, in, research, and, development, than, before, additionally, the, government, s, management, expense, grant, has, been, reduced, by, one, per, cent, annually, since, 2004, this, policy, ostensibly, aimed, at, decreasing, the, university, s, reliance, on, the, grant, and, fostering, greater, independence, has, been, blamed, as, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, the, decline, in, the, university, s, competitiveness, to, address, these, challenges, utokyo, has, implemented, various, reforms, in, 2004, the, university, of, tokyo, edge, capital, partners, utec, was, established, this, venture, capital, firm, affiliated, with, the, university, supports, entrepreneurship, arising, from, utokyo, s, research, and, development, aiming, to, drive, innovation, across, society, in, 2006, the, first, phase, of, development, was, completed, at, kashiwa, campus, situated, in, the, suburb, of, kashiwa, this, research, focused, campus, spans, 405, 313, square, metres, 100, acres, and, has, been, at, the, forefront, of, advanced, scientific, research, since, its, inception, in, 2010, in, an, attempt, to, further, internationalise, and, diversify, its, student, body, the, university, increased, its, autumn, enrollment, opportunities, for, international, students, utokyo, plans, to, increase, the, proportion, of, female, faculty, members, to, above, a, quarter, by, newly, creating, positions, for, 300, female, lecturers, by, 2027, in, 2021, the, newly, elected, president, teruo, fujii, announced, the, utokyo, compass, a, guiding, framework, for, the, university, during, his, tenure, focusing, on, diversity, dialogue, and, creating, a, better, future, it, emphasises, the, university, s, autonomy, and, creativity, in, a, new, era, advocating, multifaceted, perspectives, on, knowledge, people, and, places, the, compass, encourages, dialogue, throughout, the, university, and, society, as, a, pivotal, tool, for, understanding, and, questioning, fostering, inclusivity, and, tackling, global, challenges, in, his, announcement, he, pledged, to, make, utokyo, a, university, that, anyone, in, the, world, would, like, to, join, the, university, of, tokyo, s, admission, process, todai, nyushi, is, regarded, as, the, most, selective, in, japan, and, is, almost, synonymous, with, something, that, is, difficult, to, achieve, to, apply, candidates, must, achieve, high, scores, in, the, common, test, for, university, admissions, a, standardised, multiple, choice, examination, utokyo, applicants, are, required, to, take, at, least, seven, subjects, in, this, exam, applicants, for, natural, sciences, take, two, mathematics, tests,

chosen, from, geography, japanese, history, or, world, history, humanities, candidates, take, two, social, studies, subjects, and, one, science, subject, instead, based, on, the, scores, from, the, common, test, approximately, three, times, the, number, of, the, final, admission, slots, are, invited, to, take, the, main, examination, in, late, february, based, on, the, idea, that, regardless,

are, called, upon, to, take, an, interview, successful, candidates, are, notified, in, march, of, the, same, year, and, are, matriculated, in, april, the, official, acceptance, rates, for, undergraduate, degrees, are, relatively, high, at, around, 30, per, cent, which, is, due, to, the, policy, of, restricting, the, number, of, students, who, can, sit, for, the, exam, based, on, the, scores, from, the, common, test, additionally, japan, s, university, admission, policy, does, not, allow, applicants, to, apply, to, multiple, prestigious, national, universities, hence, non,
