unions, on, the, fringes, of, the, industry, into, a, major, labor, union, and, led, to, the, unionization, of, the, domestic, united, states, automobile, industry, after, the, first, convention, of, uaw, in, 1936, the, union, decided, that, it, could, not, survive, by, piecemeal, organizing, campaigns, at, smaller, plants, as, it, had, in, the, past, but, that, it, could, organize, the,

its, plants, this, forced, uaw, members, to, keep, the, names, of, new, members, secret, and, meeting, workers, at, their, homes, as, the, uaw, studied, its, target, it, discovered, that, gm, had, only, two, factories, that, produced, the, dies, from, which, car, body, components, were, stamped, one, in, flint, that, produced, the, parts, for, buicks, pontiacs, and, oldsmobiles, and, another,

months, the, tool, and, die, strike, of, 1939, also, known, as, the, strategy, strike, was, an, ultimately, successful, attempt, by, the, uaw, to, be, recognized, as, the, sole, representative, for,

national, gm, strike, in, its, history, as, director, of, the, uaw, s, general, motors, department, coordinator, of, union, relations, with, gm, walter, reuther, suggested, to, his, colleagues, the, idea, of, striking, the, gm, manufacturing, plants, with, a, one, at, a, time, strategy, which, was, intended, to, maximize, pressure, on, the, target, company, reuther, also, put, forth, the, demands, of, the, strikers, a, 30, percent, increase, in, wages, and, a, hold, on, product, prices, however, the, strike, ended, with, the, dissatisfaction, of, walter, reuther, and, the, uaw, and,
