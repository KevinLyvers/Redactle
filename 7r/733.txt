courage, also, called, bravery, valour, british, and, commonwealth, english, or, valor, american, english, is, the, choice, and, willingness, to, confront, agony, pain, danger, uncertainty, or, intimidation, valor, is, courage, or, bravery, especially, in, battle, physical, courage, is, bravery, in, the, face, of, physical, pain, hardship, even, death, or, threat, of, death, while, moral, courage, is, the, ability, to, act, rightly, in, the, face, of, popular, opposition, shame, scandal, discouragement, or, personal, loss, the, classical, virtue, of, fortitude, andreia, fortitudo, is, also, translated, as, courage, but, includes, the, aspects, of, perseverance, and, patience, in, the, western, tradition, notable, thoughts, on, courage, have, come, from, philosophers, socrates, plato, aristotle, aquinas, and, kierkegaard, as, well, as, christian, beliefs, and, texts, in, the, hindu, tradition, mythology, has, given, many, examples, of, courage, with, examples, of, both, physical, and, moral, courage, exemplified, in, the, eastern, tradition, the, chinese, text, tao, te, ching, offers, a, great, deal, of, thoughts, on, courage, both, physical, and, moral, according, to, professor, daniel, putman, courage, involves, deliberate, choice, in, the, face, of, painful, or, fearful, circumstances, for, the, sake, of, a, worthy, goal, with, this, realization, putman, concludes, that, there, is, a, close, connection, between, fear, and, confidence, fear, and, confidence, in, relation, to, courage, can, determine, the, success, of, a, courageous, act, or, goal, they, can, be, seen, as, independent, variables, in, courage, and, their, relationship, can, affect, how, we, respond, to, fear, the, confidence, that, is, being, discussed, here, is, self, confidence, confidence, in, knowing, one, s, skills, and, abilities, and, being, able, to, determine, when, to, fight, fear, or, when, to, flee, it, putman, states, that, the, ideal, in, courage, is, not, just, a, rigid, control, of, fear, nor, is, it, a, denial, of, the, emotion, the, ideal, is, to, judge, a, situation, accept, the, emotion, as, part, of, human, nature, and, we, hope, use, well, developed, habits, to, confront, the, fear, and, allow, reason, to, guide, our, behavior, toward, a, worthwhile, goal, according, to, putman, aristotle, refers, to, an, appropriate, level, of, fear, and, confidence, in, courage, fear, although, it, might, vary, from, person, to, person, is, not, completely, relative, and, is, only, appropriate, if, it, matches, the, danger, of, the, situation, the, same, goes, for, confidence, in, that, there, are, two, aspects, to, self, confidence, in, a, dangerous, situation, without, an, appropriate, balance, between, fear, and, confidence, when, facing, a, threat, one, cannot, have, the, courage, to, overcome, it, professor, daniel, putman, states, if, the, two, emotions, are, distinct, then, excesses, or, deficiencies, in, either, fear, or, confidence, can, distort, courage, courage, does, not, mean, that, you, are, not, afraid, it, means, that, you, are, willing, to, face, the, challenges, that, lay, ahead, of, you, according, to, putman, there, are, four, possible, ways, courage, could, be, distorted, thus, putman, identifies, fear, and, courage, as, being, deeply, intertwined, and, that, they, rely, on, distinct, perceptions, the, danger, of, the, situation, the, worthiness, of, the, cause, and, the, perception, of, one, s, ability, plato, s, laches, discusses, courage, but, fails, to, come, to, a, satisfactory, conclusion, on, what, courage, is, many, definitions, of, courage, are, offered, including, a, man, willing, to, remain, at, his, post, and, to, defend, himself, against, the, enemy, without, running, away, a, sort, of, endurance, of, the, soul, knowledge, of, the, grounds, of, fear, and, hope, while, many, definitions, are, given, in, plato, s, laches, all, are, refuted, giving, the, reader, a, sense, of, plato, s, argument, style, laches, is, an, early, writing, of, plato, s, which, may, be, a, reason, he, does, not, come, to, a, clear, conclusion, in, this, early, writing, plato, is, still, developing, his, ideas, and, shows, influence, from, his, teachers, like, socrates, in, the, republic, plato, describes, courage, as, a, sort, of, perseverance, preservation, of, the, belief, that, has, been, inculcated, by, the, law, through, education, about, what, things, and, sorts, of, things, are, to, be, feared, plato, explains, this, perseverance, as, being, able, to, persevere, through, all, emotions, like, suffering, pleasure, and, fear, as, a, desirable, quality, courage, is, discussed, broadly, by, aristotle, in, the, context, of, soldiers, in, battle, for, a, noble, cause, in, nicomachean, ethics, where, its, absence, is, the, vice, of, cowardice, and, its, excess, the, vice, of, recklessness, courage, represents, the, mean, between, the, two, extremes, thucydides, a, 5th, century, bce, greek, historian, wrote, the, bravest, are, surely, those, who, have, the, clearest, vision, of, what, is, before, them, glory, and, danger, alike, and, yet, notwithstanding, go, out, to, meet, it, in, the, roman, empire, courage, formed, part, of, the, universal, virtue, of, virtus, roman, philosopher, and, statesman, cicero, 106, 43, bce, lists, the, cardinal, virtues, but, does, not, name, them, as, such, virtue, may, be, defined, as, a, habit, of, mind, animi, in, harmony, with, reason, and, the, order, of, nature, it, has, four, parts, wisdom, prudentiam, justice, courage, temperance, however, cicero, held, that, a, courageous, spirit, in, a, human, who, has, not, attained, perfection, and, ideal, wisdom, is, generally, too, impetuous, in, de, officiis, ministrorum, ambrose, echoes, cicero, in, holding, reservations, regarding, those, who, exhibit, courage, without, yet, having, demonstrated, a, general, moral, balance, ambrose, held, that, fortitude, without, justice, occasions, injustice, since, the, stronger, a, man, is, the, more, ready, to, oppress, the, weaker, courage, is, a, natural, virtue, which, saint, augustine, did, not, consider, a, virtue, for, christians, the, tao, te, ching, contends, that, courage, is, derived, from, love, translated, as, from, love, one, gains, courage, in, hindu, tradition, courage, shauriya, bravery, dhairya, and, patience, taamasa, appear, as, the, first, two, of, ten, characteristics, lakshana, of, dharma, in, the, hindu, manusm, ti, alongside, forgiveness, kshama, tolerance, dama, honesty, asthaya, physical, restraint, indriya, nigraha, cleanliness, shouchya, perceptiveness, dhi, knowledge, vidhya, truthfulness, satya, and, control, of, anger, akrodha, islamic, beliefs, also, present, courage, and, self, control, as, a, key, factors, in, facing, the, devil, both, internally, and, externally, many, have, this, belief, because, of, the, courage, the, prophets, of, the, past, displayed, through, peace, and, patience, despite, there, being, people, who, despised, them, thomas, hobbes, lists, virtues, into, the, categories, of, moral, virtues, and, virtues, of, men, in, his, work, man, and, citizen, hobbes, outlines, moral, virtues, as, virtues, in, citizens, that, is, virtues, that, without, exception, are, beneficial, to, society, as, a, whole, these, moral, virtues, are, justice, i, e, not, violating, the, law, and, charity, courage, as, well, as, prudence, and, temperance, are, listed, as, the, virtues, of, men, by, this, hobbes, means, that, these, virtues, are, invested, solely, in, the, private, good, as, opposed, to, the, public, good, of, justice, and, charity, hobbes, describes, courage, and, prudence, as, strengths, of, mind, as, opposed, to, a, goodness, of, manners, these, virtues, are, always, meant, to, act, in, the, interests, of, individual, while, the, positive, and, or, negative, effects, of, society, are, merely, a, byproduct, this, stems, forth, from, the, idea, put, forth, in, leviathan, that, the, state, of, nature, is, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, and, self, preservation, is, the, most, fundamental, aspect, of, behavior, according, to, hobbes, courage, is, a, virtue, of, the, individual, in, order, to, ensure, a, better, chance, of, survival, while, the, moral, virtues, address, hobbes, s, social, contract, which, civilized, men, display, in, varying, degrees, in, order, to, transcend, the, state, of, nature, hobbes, also, uses, the, idea, of, fortitude, as, a, virtue, fortitude, is, to, dare, according, to, hobbes, but, also, to, resist, stoutly, in, present, dangers, this, is, a, more, in, depth, elaboration, of, hobbes, s, concept, of, courage, that, is, addressed, earlier, in, man, and, citizen, david, hume, listed, virtues, into, two, categories, in, his, work, a, treatise, of, human, nature, artificial, virtues, and, natural, virtues, hume, categorized, courage, as, a, natural, virtue, in, the, treatise, s, section, of, pride, and, humility, their, objects, and, causes, hume, wrote, that, courage, is, a, cause, of, pride, every, valuable, quality, of, the, mind, whether, of, the, imagination, judgment, memory, or, disposition, wit, good, sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity, all, these, are, the, cause, of, pride, and, their, opposites, of, humility, hume, also, wrote, that, courage, and, joy, have, positive, effects, on, the, soul, since, the, soul, when, elevated, with, joy, and, courage, in, a, manner, seeks, opposition, and, throws, itself, with, alacrity, into, any, scene, of, thought, or, action, where, its, courage, meets, with, matter, to, nourish, and, employ, it, along, with, courage, nourishing, and, employing, hume, also, wrote, that, courage, defends, humans, in, the, treatise, we, easily, gain, from, the, liberality, of, others, but, are, always, in, danger, of, losing, by, their, avarice, courage, defends, us, but, cowardice, lays, us, open, to, every, attack, hume, considered, what, excessive, courage, does, to, a, hero, s, character, in, the, treatise, s, section, of, the, other, virtues, and, vices, accordingly, we, may, observe, that, an, excessive, courage, and, magnanimity, especially, when, it, displays, itself, under, the, frowns, of, fortune, contributes, in, a, great, measure, to, the, character, of, a, hero, and, will, render, a, person, the, admiration, of, posterity, at, the, same, time, that, it, ruins, his, affairs, and, leads, him, into, dangers, and, difficulties, with, which, otherwise, he, would, never, have, been, acquainted, other, understandings, of, courage, that, hume, offered, can, be, derived, from, hume, s, views, on, morals, reason, sentiment, and, virtue, from, his, work, an, enquiry, concerning, the, principles, of, morals, s, ren, kierkegaard, opposed, courage, to, angst, while, paul, tillich, opposed, an, existential, courage, to, be, with, non, being, fundamentally, equating, it, with, religion, courage, is, the, self, affirmation, of, being, in, spite, of, the, fact, of, non, being, it, is, the, act, of, the, individual, self, in, taking, the, anxiety, of, non, being, upon, itself, by, affirming, itself, in, the, anxiety, of, guilt, and, condemnation, every, courage, to, be, has, openly, or, covertly, a, religious, root, for, religion, is, the, state, of, being, grasped, by, the, power, of, being, itself, j, r, r, tolkien, identified, in, his, 1936, lecture, beowulf, the, monsters, and, the, critics, a, northern, theory, of, courage, the, heroic, or, virtuous, pagan, insistence, to, do, the, right, thing, even, in, the, face, of, certain, defeat, without, promise, of, reward, or, salvation, it, is, the, strength, of, the, northern, mythological, imagination, that, it, faced, this, problem, put, the, monsters, in, the, centre, gave, them, victory, but, no, honor, and, found, a, potent, and, terrible, solution, in, naked, will, and, courage, as, a, working, theory, absolutely, impregnable, so, potent, is, it, that, while, the, older, southern, imagination, has, faded, forever, into, literary, ornament, the, northern, has, power, as, it, were, to, revive, its, spirit, even, in, our, own, times, it, can, work, as, it, did, even, with, the, go, lauss, viking, without, gods, martial, heroism, as, its, own, end, virtuous, pagan, heroism, or, courage, in, this, sense, is, trusting, in, your, own, strength, as, observed, by, jacob, grimm, in, his, teutonic, mythology, men, who, turning, away, in, utter, disgust, and, doubt, from, the, heathen, faith, placed, their, reliance, on, their, own, strength, and, virtue, thus, in, the, s, lar, lio, 17, we, read, of, v, bogi, and, r, dey, sik, au, tr, u, in, themselves, they, trusted, ernest, hemingway, famously, defined, courage, as, grace, under, pressure, winston, churchill, stated, courage, is, rightly, esteemed, the, first, of, human, qualities, because, it, is, the, quality, that, guarantees, all, others, according, to, maya, angelou, courage, is, the, most, important, of, the, virtues, because, without, courage, you, can, t, practice, any, other, virtue, consistently, you, can, practice, any, virtue, erratically, but, nothing, consistently, without, courage, and, c, s, lewis, wrote, that, courage, is, not, simply, one, of, the, virtues, but, the, form, of, every, virtue, at, the, testing, point, which, means, at, the, point, of, highest, reality, in, beyond, good, and, evil, friedrich, nietzsche, describes, master, slave, morality, in, which, a, noble, man, regards, himself, as, a, determiner, of, values, one, who, does, not, require, approval, but, passes, judgment, later, in, the, same, text, he, lists, man, s, four, virtues, as, courage, insight, sympathy, and, solitude, and, goes, on, to, emphasize, the, importance, of, courage, the, great, epochs, of, our, life, are, the, occasions, when, we, gain, the, courage, to, re, baptize, our, evil, qualities, as, our, best, qualities, according, to, the, swiss, psychologist, andreas, dick, courage, consists, of, the, following, components, researchers, who, want, to, study, the, concept, and, the, emotion, of, courage, have, continued, to, come, across, a, certain, problem, while, there, are, numerous, definitions, of, courage, they, are, unable, to, set, an, operational, definition, of, courage, on, which, to, base, sound, explicit, theories, rate, et, al, states, that, because, of, a, lack, of, an, operational, definition, the, advancement, of, research, in, courage, is, limited, so, they, conducted, studies, to, try, to, find, a, common, structure, of, courage, their, goal, from, their, research, of, implicit, theories, was, to, find, people, s, form, and, content, on, the, idea, of, courage, many, researchers, created, studies, on, implicit, theories, by, creating, a, questionnaire, that, would, ask, what, is, courage, in, addition, in, order, to, develop, a, measurement, scale, of, courage, ten, experts, in, the, field, of, psychology, came, together, to, define, courage, they, defined, it, as, the, ability, to, act, for, a, meaningful, noble, good, or, practical, cause, despite, experiencing, the, fear, associated, with, perceived, threat, exceeding, the, available, resources, also, because, courage, is, a, multi, dimensional, construct, it, can, be, better, understood, as, an, exceptional, response, to, specific, external, conditions, or, circumstances, than, as, an, attribute, disposition, or, character, trait, meaning, that, rather, than, being, a, show, character, or, an, attribute, courage, is, a, response, to, fear, from, their, research, they, were, able, to, find, the, four, necessary, components, of, people, s, notion, of, courage, they, are, with, these, four, components, they, were, able, to, define, courage, as, a, willful, intentional, act, executed, after, mindful, deliberation, involving, objective, substantial, risk, to, the, actor, primarily, motivated, to, bring, about, a, noble, good, or, worthy, end, despite, perhaps, the, presence, of, the, emotion, of, fear, to, further, the, discussion, of, the, implicit, theories, of, courage, the, researchers, stated, that, future, research, could, consider, looking, into, the, concept, of, courage, and, fear, and, how, individual, s, might, feel, fear, overcome, it, and, act, and, act, despite, it, the, term, clinical, courage, came, to, light, in, relation, to, modern, medicine, in, the, 2000s, mostly, in, relation, to, the, practice, of, medicine, in, remote, or, resource, limited, settings, it, has, been, described, as, the, practice, of, medicine, outside, of, a, clinician, s, usual, scope, of, practice, or, relevant, clinical, guidelines, in, order, to, provide, essential, medical, care, where, no, alternative, exists, it, has, been, specifically, discussed, in, relation, to, rural, generalists, paramedics, general, practitioners, and, rural, medicine, the, opposing, theory, is, that, of, clinical, recklessness, in, which, the, actions, of, a, clinician, in, stepping, outside, of, their, competence, results, in, unprofessional, behaviour, which, exposes, patients, to, risk, or, harm, one, symbol, often, associated, with, courage, is, the, lion, it, is, sometimes, seen, in, the, catholic, church, as, a, depiction, of, christ, s, triumph, over, sin, it, also, is, a, symbol, in, some, cultures, as, a, savior, of, the, people, who, live, in, a, community, with, sin, and, corruption, fortitude, and, courage, are, distinguishable, in, that, fortitude, is, the, mental, or, emotional, strength, that, enables, courage, in, the, face, of, adversity, according, to, presbyterian, theologian, william, swan, plumer, there, is, also, in, strict, propriety, of, language, a, difference, between, courage, and, fortitude, courage, faces, and, resists, danger, fortitude, endures, pain, courage, is, for, action, fortitude, for, suffering, in, this, sense, fortitude, differs, little, from, constancy, and, patient, endurance, thomas, aquinas, says, that, fortitude, ranks, third, after, prudence, and, justice, among, the, cardinal, virtues, he, distinguishes, fortitude, from, fearlessness, which, can, too, easily, become, recklessness, through, short, sighted, audacity, with, disastrous, results, in, both, catholicism, and, anglicanism, fortitude, is, also, one, of, the, seven, gifts, of, the, holy, spirit, several, awards, claim, to, recognize, courageous, actions, including
