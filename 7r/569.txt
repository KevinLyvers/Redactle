the, statute, of, westminster, 1931, is, an, act, of, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, that, sets, the, basis, for, the, relationship, between, the, dominions, now, called, commonwealth, realms, and, the, crown, passed, on, 11, december, 1931, the, statute, increased, the, sovereignty, of, the, self, governing, dominions, of, the, british, empire, from, the, united, kingdom, it, also, bound, them, all, to, seek, each, other, s, approval, for, changes, to, monarchical, titles, and, the, common, line, of, succession, the, statute, was, effective, either, immediately, or, upon, ratification, it, thus, became, a, statutory, embodiment, of, the, principles, of, equality, and, common, allegiance, to, the, crown, set, out, in, the, balfour, declaration, of, 1926, as, the, statute, removed, nearly, all, of, the, british, parliament, s, authority, to, legislate, for, the, dominions, it, was, a, crucial, step, in, the, development, of, the, dominions, as, separate, independent, and, sovereign, states, its, modified, versions, are, now, domestic, law, in, australia, and, canada, it, has, been, repealed, in, new, zealand, and, implicitly, in, former, dominions, that, are, no, longer, commonwealth, realms, england, and, britain, after, 1707, had, colonies, outside, of, europe, since, the, late, 16th, century, these, early, colonies, were, largely, run, by, private, companies, rather, than, the, crown, directly, but, by, the, end, of, the, century, had, except, for, india, been, subsumed, under, crown, control, oversight, of, these, colonies, oscillated, between, relatively, lax, enforcement, of, laws, and, centralisation, of, power, depending, on, the, politics, of, the, day, but, the, parliament, in, westminster, always, remained, supreme, most, colonies, in, north, america, broke, away, from, british, rule, and, became, independent, as, the, united, states, in, the, late, 18th, century, whereafter, british, attention, turned, towards, australia, and, asia, british, policy, with, regards, to, the, colonies, began, to, be, rationalized, and, streamlined, in, the, 19th, century, responsible, government, wherein, colonial, governments, were, held, accountable, to, legislatures, just, as, the, british, cabinet, was, responsible, to, the, british, parliament, was, granted, to, colonies, beginning, with, nova, scotia, in, 1848, confusion, existed, as, to, what, extent, british, legislation, applied, to, the, colonies, in, south, australia, justice, benjamin, boothby, caused, a, nuisance, by, striking, down, several, local, laws, as, contrary, repugnant, to, the, legislation, in, britain, westminster, rectified, this, situation, by, passing, the, colonial, laws, validity, act, 1865, which, allowed, the, colonies, to, pass, legislation, different, from, that, in, britain, provided, that, it, was, not, repugnant, to, any, law, expressly, passed, by, the, imperial, parliament, to, extend, to, that, colony, this, had, the, dual, effect, of, granting, colonies, autonomy, within, their, borders, while, subordinating, them, to, the, british, parliament, otherwise, most, of, the, remaining, colonies, in, north, america, everything, north, of, the, united, states, with, the, exception, of, newfoundland, were, merged, into, a, federal, polity, known, as, canada, in, the, late, 1860s, and, early, 1870s, canada, was, termed, a, dominion, a, term, previously, used, in, slightly, different, contexts, in, english, history, and, granted, a, broad, array, of, powers, between, the, federal, government, and, the, provincial, governments, australia, was, similarly, deemed, a, dominion, when, it, federated, in, 1901, as, were, newfoundland, new, zealand, south, africa, and, the, irish, free, state, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, dominions, did, not, possess, full, sovereignty, on, an, equal, footing, with, the, united, kingdom, the, parliament, of, canada, passed, a, law, barring, appeals, from, its, supreme, court, to, the, imperial, judicial, committee, of, the, privy, council, in, 1888, but, in, 1925, a, judgement, of, the, privy, council, determined, that, this, law, was, invalid, combined, with, the, king, byng, affair, the, following, year, this, bred, resentment, in, canada, and, led, to, its, insistence, on, full, sovereignty, the, leadership, of, the, irish, free, state, meanwhile, was, dominated, by, those, who, had, fought, a, war, of, independence, against, britain, and, who, had, agreed, to, dominion, status, as, a, compromise, they, took, a, maximalist, view, of, the, autonomy, they, had, secured, in, the, anglo, irish, treaty, and, pushed, for, recognition, of, their, state, s, sovereignty, which, would, have, implications, for, the, other, dominions, as, well, the, 1926, imperial, conference, led, to, the, balfour, declaration, that, dominions, were, equal, in, status, to, one, another, and, to, the, united, kingdom, further, conferences, in, 1929, and, 1930, worked, out, a, substantive, framework, to, implement, this, declaration, this, became, the, statute, of, westminster, 1931, the, statute, of, westminster, gave, effect, to, certain, political, resolutions, passed, by, the, imperial, conferences, of, 1926, and, 1930, in, particular, the, balfour, declaration, of, 1926, the, main, effect, was, the, removal, of, the, ability, of, the, british, parliament, to, legislate, for, the, dominions, part, of, which, also, required, the, repeal, of, the, colonial, laws, validity, act, 1865, in, its, application, to, the, dominions, king, george, v, expressed, his, desire, that, the, laws, of, royal, succession, be, exempt, from, the, statute, s, provisions, but, it, was, determined, that, this, would, be, contrary, to, the, principles, of, equality, set, out, in, the, balfour, declaration, both, canada, and, the, irish, free, state, pushed, for, the, ability, to, amend, the, succession, laws, themselves, and, section, 2, 2, allowing, a, dominion, to, amend, or, repeal, laws, of, paramount, force, such, as, the, succession, laws, insofar, as, they, are, part, of, the, law, of, that, dominion, was, included, in, the, statute, of, westminster, at, canada, s, insistence, after, the, statute, was, passed, the, british, parliament, could, no, longer, make, laws, for, the, dominions, other, than, with, the, request, and, consent, of, the, government, of, that, dominion, the, statute, provides, in, section, 4, no, act, of, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, passed, after, the, commencement, of, this, act, shall, extend, or, be, deemed, to, extend, to, a, dominion, as, part, of, the, law, of, that, dominion, unless, it, is, expressly, declared, in, that, act, that, that, dominion, has, requested, and, consented, to, the, enactment, thereof, it, also, provides, in, section, 2, 1, no, law, and, no, provision, of, any, law, made, after, the, commencement, of, this, act, by, the, parliament, of, a, dominion, shall, be, void, or, inoperative, on, the, ground, that, it, is, repugnant, to, the, law, of, england, or, to, the, provisions, of, any, existing, or, future, act, of, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, or, to, any, order, rule, or, regulation, made, under, any, such, act, and, the, powers, of, the, parliament, of, a, dominion, shall, include, the, power, to, repeal, or, amend, any, such, act, order, rule, or, regulation, in, so, far, as, the, same, is, part, of, the, law, of, the, dominion, the, whole, statute, applied, to, the, dominion, of, canada, the, irish, free, state, and, the, union, of, south, africa, without, the, need, for, any, acts, of, ratification, the, governments, of, those, countries, gave, their, consent, to, the, application, of, the, law, to, their, respective, jurisdictions, section, 10, of, the, statute, provided, that, sections, 2, to, 6, would, apply, in, the, other, three, dominions, australia, new, zealand, and, newfoundland, only, after, the, respective, parliament, of, that, dominion, had, legislated, to, adopt, them, since, 1931, over, a, dozen, new, commonwealth, realms, have, been, created, all, of, which, now, hold, the, same, powers, as, the, united, kingdom, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, over, matters, of, change, to, the, monarchy, though, the, statute, of, westminster, is, not, part, of, their, laws, ireland, and, south, africa, are, now, republics, and, newfoundland, is, now, part, of, canada, as, a, province, australia, adopted, sections, 2, to, 6, of, the, statute, of, westminster, with, the, statute, of, westminster, adoption, act, 1942, in, order, to, clarify, the, validity, of, certain, australian, legislation, relating, to, the, second, world, war, the, adoption, was, backdated, to, 3, september, 1939, the, date, that, britain, and, australia, joined, the, war, adopting, section, 2, of, the, statute, clarified, that, the, parliament, of, australia, was, able, to, legislate, inconsistently, with, british, legislation, adopting, section, 3, clarified, that, it, could, legislate, with, extraterritorial, effect, adopting, section, 4, clarified, that, britain, could, legislate, with, effect, on, australia, as, a, whole, only, with, australia, s, request, and, consent, nonetheless, under, section, 9, of, the, statute, on, matters, not, within, commonwealth, power, britain, could, still, legislate, with, effect, in, all, or, any, of, the, australian, states, without, the, agreement, of, the, commonwealth, although, only, to, the, extent, of, the, constitutional, practice, existing, before, the, commencement, of, the, statute, however, this, capacity, had, never, been, used, in, particular, it, was, not, used, to, implement, the, result, of, the, 1933, western, australian, secession, referendum, as, it, did, not, have, the, support, of, the, australian, government, all, british, power, to, legislate, with, effect, in, australia, ended, with, the, australia, act, 1986, the, british, version, of, which, says, that, it, was, passed, with, the, request, and, consent, of, the, australian, parliament, which, had, obtained, the, concurrence, of, the, parliaments, of, the, australian, states, this, statute, limited, the, legislative, authority, of, the, british, parliament, over, canada, effectively, giving, the, country, legal, autonomy, as, a, self, governing, dominion, though, the, british, parliament, retained, the, power, to, amend, canada, s, constitution, at, the, request, of, canada, that, authority, remained, in, effect, until, the, constitution, act, 1982, which, transferred, it, to, canada, the, final, step, to, achieving, full, sovereignty, the, british, north, america, acts, the, written, elements, in, 1931, of, the, canadian, constitution, were, excluded, from, the, application, of, the, statute, because, of, disagreements, between, the, canadian, provinces, and, the, federal, government, over, how, the, british, north, america, acts, could, be, otherwise, amended, these, disagreements, were, resolved, only, in, time, for, the, passage, of, the, canada, act, 1982, thus, completing, the, patriation, of, the, canadian, constitution, to, canada, at, that, time, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, also, repealed, ss, 4, and, 7, 1, of, the, statute, of, westminster, as, applied, to, canada, the, statute, of, westminster, as, amended, remains, a, part, of, the, constitution, of, canada, by, virtue, of, section, 52, 2, b, of, and, the, schedule, to, the, constitution, act, 1982, the, newfoundland, terms, of, union, expressly, provide, for, the, application, of, the, statute, of, westminster, to, the, province, of, newfoundland, and, labrador, as, a, consequence, of, the, statute, s, adoption, the, parliament, of, canada, gained, the, ability, to, abolish, appeals, to, the, judicial, committee, of, the, privy, council, criminal, appeals, were, abolished, in, 1933, while, civil, appeals, continued, until, 1949, the, passage, of, the, statute, of, westminster, meant, that, changes, in, british, legislation, governing, the, succession, to, the, throne, no, longer, automatically, applied, to, canada, the, irish, free, state, never, formally, adopted, the, statute, of, westminster, its, executive, council, cabinet, taking, the, view, that, the, anglo, irish, treaty, of, 1921, had, already, ended, westminster, s, right, to, legislate, for, the, irish, free, state, the, free, state, s, constitution, gave, the, oireachtas, sole, and, exclusive, power, of, making, laws, hence, even, before, 1931, the, irish, free, state, did, not, arrest, british, army, and, royal, air, force, deserters, on, its, territory, even, though, the, uk, believed, post, 1922, british, laws, gave, the, free, state, s, garda, s, och, na, the, power, to, do, so, the, uk, s, irish, free, state, constitution, act, 1922, said, however, othing, in, the, constitution, shall, be, construed, as, prejudicing, the, power, of, parliament, to, make, laws, affecting, the, irish, free, state, in, any, case, where, in, accordance, with, constitutional, practice, parliament, would, make, laws, affecting, other, self, governing, dominions, motions, of, approval, of, the, report, of, the, commonwealth, conference, had, been, passed, by, the, d, il, and, seanad, in, may, 1931, and, the, final, form, of, the, statute, of, westminster, included, the, irish, free, state, among, the, dominions, the, british, parliament, could, not, legislate, for, without, the, dominion, s, request, and, consent, originally, the, uk, government, had, wanted, to, exclude, from, the, statute, of, westminster, the, legislation, underpinning, the, 1921, treaty, from, which, the, free, state, s, constitution, had, emerged, executive, council, president, prime, minister, w, t, cosgrave, objected, although, he, promised, that, the, executive, council, would, not, amend, the, legislation, unilaterally, the, other, dominions, backed, cosgrave, and, when, an, amendment, to, similar, effect, was, proposed, at, westminster, by, john, gretton, parliament, duly, voted, it, down, when, the, statute, became, law, in, the, uk, patrick, mcgilligan, the, free, state, minister, for, external, affairs, stated, it, is, a, solemn, declaration, by, the, british, people, through, their, representatives, in, parliament, that, the, powers, inherent, in, the, treaty, position, are, what, we, have, proclaimed, them, to, be, for, the, last, ten, years, he, went, on, to, present, the, statute, as, largely, the, fruit, of, the, free, state, s, efforts, to, secure, for, the, other, dominions, the, same, benefits, it, already, enjoyed, under, the, treaty, the, statute, of, westminster, had, the, effect, of, granting, the, irish, free, state, internationally, recognised, independence, amon, de, valera, led, fianna, f, il, to, victory, in, the, free, state, election, of, 1932, on, a, platform, of, republicanising, the, free, state, from, within, upon, taking, office, de, valera, began, removing, the, monarchical, elements, of, the, constitution, beginning, with, the, oath, of, allegiance, de, valera, initially, considered, invoking, the, statute, of, westminster, in, making, these, changes, but, john, j, hearne, advised, him, not, to, abolishing, the, oath, of, allegiance, in, effect, abrogated, the, 1921, treaty, generally, the, british, thought, that, this, was, morally, objectionable, but, legally, permitted, by, the, statute, of, westminster, robert, lyon, moore, a, southern, unionist, from, county, donegal, challenged, the, legality, of, the, abolition, in, the, irish, free, state, s, courts, and, then, appealed, to, the, judicial, committee, of, the, privy, council, jcpc, in, london, however, the, free, state, had, also, abolished, the, right, of, appeal, to, the, jcpc, in, 1935, the, jcpc, ruled, that, both, abolitions, were, valid, under, the, statute, of, westminster, the, irish, free, state, which, in, 1937, was, renamed, ireland, left, the, commonwealth, in, 1949, upon, the, coming, into, force, of, the, republic, of, ireland, act, 1948, the, parliament, of, new, zealand, adopted, the, statute, of, westminster, by, passing, its, statute, of, westminster, adoption, act, 1947, in, november, 1947, the, new, zealand, constitution, amendment, act, passed, the, same, year, empowered, the, new, zealand, parliament, to, change, the, constitution, but, did, not, remove, the, ability, of, the, british, parliament, to, legislate, regarding, the, new, zealand, constitution, the, remaining, role, of, the, british, parliament, was, removed, by, the, new, zealand, constitution, act, 1986, and, the, statute, of, westminster, was, repealed, in, its, entirety, the, dominion, of, newfoundland, never, adopted, the, statute, of, westminster, especially, because, of, financial, troubles, and, corruption, there, by, request, of, the, dominion, s, government, the, united, kingdom, established, the, commission, of, government, in, 1934, resuming, direct, rule, of, newfoundland, that, arrangement, remained, until, newfoundland, became, a, province, of, canada, in, 1949, following, referendums, on, the, issue, in, 1948, the, statute, of, westminster, became, applicable, to, newfoundland, when, it, was, admitted, to, canada, although, the, union, of, south, africa, was, not, among, the, dominions, that, needed, to, adopt, the, statute, of, westminster, for, it, to, take, effect, two, laws, the, status, of, the, union, act, 1934, and, the, royal, executive, functions, and, seals, act, of, 1934, were, passed, to, confirm, south, africa, s, status, as, a, fully, sovereign, state, the, preamble, to, the, statute, of, westminster, sets, out, a, guideline, for, changing, the, rules, of, succession, to, the, crown, the, second, paragraph, of, the, preamble, to, the, statute, reads, and, whereas, it, is, meet, and, proper, to, set, out, by, way, of, preamble, to, this, act, that, inasmuch, as, the, crown, is, the, symbol, of, the, free, association, of, the, members, of, the, british, commonwealth, of, nations, and, as, they, are, united, by, a, common, allegiance, to, the, crown, it, would, be, in, accord, with, the, established, constitutional, position, of, all, the, members, of, the, commonwealth, in, relation, to, one, another, that, any, alteration, in, the, law, touching, the, succession, to, the, throne, or, the, royal, style, and, titles, shall, hereafter, require, the, assent, as, well, of, the, parliaments, of, all, the, dominions, as, of, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, though, a, preamble, is, not, considered, to, have, the, force, of, statute, law, that, of, the, statute, of, westminster, has, come, to, be, a, constitutional, convention, which, has, always, been, treated, in, practice, as, though, it, were, a, binding, requirement, the, convention, was, then, adopted, by, every, country, that, subsequently, gained, its, independence, from, britain, and, became, a, commonwealth, realm, during, the, abdication, crisis, in, 1936, british, prime, minister, stanley, baldwin, consulted, the, commonwealth, prime, ministers, at, the, request, of, king, edward, viii, the, king, wanted, to, marry, wallis, simpson, whom, baldwin, and, other, british, politicians, considered, unacceptable, as, queen, as, she, was, an, american, divorc, e, baldwin, was, able, to, get, the, then, five, dominion, prime, ministers, to, agree, with, this, and, thus, register, their, official, disapproval, at, the, king, s, planned, marriage, the, king, later, requested, the, commonwealth, prime, ministers, be, consulted, on, a, compromise, plan, in, which, he, would, wed, simpson, under, a, morganatic, marriage, pursuant, to, which, she, would, not, become, queen, under, baldwin, s, pressure, this, plan, was, also, rejected, by, the, dominions, all, of, these, negotiations, occurred, at, a, diplomatic, level, and, never, went, to, the, commonwealth, parliaments, the, enabling, legislation, that, allowed, for, the, actual, abdication, his, majesty, s, declaration, of, abdication, act, 1936, did, require, the, assent, of, each, dominion, parliament, to, be, passed, and, the, request, and, consent, of, the, dominion, governments, so, as, to, allow, it, to, be, part, of, the, law, of, each, dominion, for, expediency, and, to, avoid, embarrassment, the, british, government, had, suggested, the, dominion, governments, regard, whoever, is, monarch, of, the, uk, to, automatically, be, their, monarch, but, the, dominions, rejected, this, prime, minister, of, canada, william, lyon, mackenzie, king, pointed, out, that, the, statute, of, westminster, required, canada, s, request, and, consent, to, any, legislation, passed, by, the, british, parliament, before, it, could, become, part, of, canada, s, laws, and, affect, the, line, of, succession, in, canada, the, text, of, the, british, act, states, that, canada, requested, and, consented, the, only, dominion, to, formally, do, both, to, the, act, applying, in, canada, under, the, statute, of, westminster, while, australia, new, zealand, and, the, union, of, south, africa, simply, assented, in, february, 1937, the, south, african, parliament, formally, gave, its, assent, by, passing, his, majesty, king, edward, the, eighth, s, abdication, act, 1937, which, declared, that, edward, viii, had, abdicated, on, 10, december, 1936, that, he, and, his, descendants, if, any, would, have, no, right, of, succession, to, the, throne, and, that, the, royal, marriages, act, 1772, would, not, apply, to, him, or, his, descendants, if, any, the, move, was, largely, done, for, symbolic, purposes, in, an, attempt, by, prime, minister, j, b, m, hertzog, to, assert, south, africa, s, independence, from, britain, in, canada, the, federal, parliament, passed, the, succession, to, the, throne, act, 1937, to, assent, to, his, majesty, s, declaration, of, abdication, act, and, ratify, the, government, s, request, and, consent, to, it, in, the, irish, free, state, prime, minister, amon, de, valera, used, the, departure, of, edward, viii, as, an, opportunity, to, remove, all, explicit, mention, of, the, monarch, from, the, constitution, of, the, irish, free, state, through, the, constitution, amendment, no, 27, act, 1936, passed, on, 11, december, 1936, the, following, day, the, external, relations, act, provided, for, the, king, to, carry, out, certain, diplomatic, functions, if, authorised, by, law, the, same, act, also, brought, edward, viii, s, instrument, of, abdication, into, effect, for, the, purposes, of, irish, law, s, 3, 2, a, new, constitution, of, ireland, with, a, president, was, approved, by, irish, voters, in, 1937, with, the, irish, free, state, becoming, simply, ireland, or, in, the, irish, language, ire, the, head, of, state, of, ireland, remained, unclear, until, 1949, when, ireland, unambiguously, became, a, republic, outside, the, commonwealth, of, nations, by, enacting, the, republic, of, ireland, act, 1948, in, some, countries, where, the, statute, of, westminster, forms, a, part, of, the, constitution, the, anniversary, of, the, date, of, the, passage, of, the, original, british, statute, is, commemorated, as, statute, of, westminster, day, in, canada, it, is, mandated, that, on, 11, december, the, royal, union, flag, as, the, union, jack, is, called, by, law, in, canada, is, to, be, flown, at, properties, owned, by, the, federal, crown, where, the, requisite, second, flag, pole, is, available
