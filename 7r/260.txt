and, brazil, and, the, second, consisting, of, a, wave, of, relatively, recent, migrants, the, majority, of, whom, began, to, migrate, to, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, following, some, of, the, major, economic, and, political, changes, encountered, in, africa, in, the, 1960s, to, 1980s, the, oldest, known, textual, reference, to, the, name, yoruba, is, found, in, an, essay,

together, with, the, isolate, igala, form, the, yoruboid, group, of, languages, within, what, we, now, have, as, west, africa, igala, and, yoruba, have, important, historical, and, cultural, relationships, the, languages, of, the, two, ethnic, groups, bear, such, a, close, resemblance, that, researchers, such, as, forde, 1951, and, westermann, and, bryan, 1952, regarded, igala, as, a, dialect, of, yoruba, the, yoruboid, languages, are, assumed, to, have, developed, out, of, an, undifferentiated, volta, niger, group, by, the, first, millennium, bce, there, are, three, major, dialect, areas, northwest, central, and, southeast, as, the, north, west, yoruba, dialects, show, more, linguistic, innovation, combined, with, the, fact, that, southeast, and, central, yoruba, areas, generally, have, older, settlements, suggests, a, later, date, of, immigration, into, northwestern, yoruba, territory, the, area, where, north, west, yoruba, nwy, is, spoken, corresponds, to, the,

newsreaders, on, the, radio, it, is, mostly, entirely, based, on, northwestern, yoruba, dialects, of, the, oyos, and, the, egbas, and, has, its, origins, in, two, sources, the, work, of, yoruba, christian, missionaries, based, mostly, in, the, egba, hinterland, at, abeokuta, and, the, yoruba, grammar, compiled, in, the, 1850s, by, bishop, crowther, who, himself, was, a, sierra, leonean, recaptive, of, oyo, origin, this, was, exemplified, by, the, following, remark, by, adetugb, 1967, as, cited, in, fagborun, 1994, while, the, orthography, agreed, upon, by, the, missionaries, represented, to, a, very, large, degree, the, phonemes, of, the, ab, okuta, dialect, the, morpho, syntax, reflected, the, y, ibadan, dialects, yoruba, people, have, a, sense, of, group, identity, around, a, number, of, cultural, concepts, beliefs, and, practices, recognizable, by, all, members, of, the, ethnic, group, prominent, among, these, is, the, tracing, of, the, entire, yoruba, body, through, dynastic, migrations, to, roots, formed, in, ile, ife, an, ancient, city, in, the, forested, heart, of, central, yorubaland, and, its, acceptance, as, the, spiritual, nucleus, of, yoruba, existence, following, this, linkage, to, the, ancient, city, of, ife, is, the, acknowledgement, of, an, historic, crowned, king, oduduwa, a, personage, nominally, considered, the, father, of, the, yoruba, people, according, to, ife, s, own, account, oduduwa, descended, into, the, originally, thirteen, semi, autonomous, proto, ife, communities, which, existed, in, a, state, of, confederacy, based, around, a, swampy, depression, surrounded, by, seven, hills, that, would, later, on, become, ife, from, the, community, of, oke, ora, an, elevated, abode, located, at, the, summit, of, a, hill, to, ife, s, east, the, intervention, of, oduduwa, a, native, of, oke, ora, and, considered, an, outsider, in, the, politics, of, the, ife, valley, is, widely, acknowledged, in, ife, to, be, the, turning, point, that, revolutionized, the, politics, of, the, confederacy, which, was, at, the, time, led, by, obatala, beyond, the, historical, accounts, surrounding, ife, and, its, ancient, rulership, more, cultural, markers, which, unite, the, yoruba, people, as, members, of, the, same, ethnicity, include, the, universal, recognition, of, a, number, of, spiritual, concepts, and, chief, divinities, orisha, who, have, achieved, pan, yoruba, statuses, these, divinities, are, venerated, as, embodiments, of, natural, forces, and, divine, power, they, are, also, the, mediators, between, the, common, people, and, olodumare, god, they, include, some, now, such, well, known, divinities, as, obatala, ogun, orunmila, osun, eshu, olokun, yemoja, osanyin, shango, among, others, these, are, now, recognizable, in, the, new, world, as, divinities, brought, across, the, atlantic, by, people, of, yoruba, descent, there, in, their, new, ex, situ, environment, they, serve, as, a, mechanism, of, maintaining, group, identity, as, well, as, a, powerful, connection, to, the, yoruba, homeland, among, people, of, yoruba, descent, and, others, examples, of, such, new, world, practices, are, santeria, candomble, umbanda, k, l, and, trinidad, orisha, which, are, not, only, religious, societies, but, also, actual, ethnic, societies, for, those, who, sought, to, maintain, their, unique, heritages, over, time, although, anyone, could, join, as, long, as, they, became, immersed, in, the, yoruba, worldview, linguistically, the, yoruboid, languages, and, in, particular, the, edekiri, subgroup, form, a, closed, group, of, mutually, intelligible, dialects, which, strongly, bound, the, people, who, speak, them, together, as, members, of, the, same, linguistic, community, this, dialectal, area, spans, from, the, lands, of, the, ana, ife, people, in, central, togo, and, eastern, ghana, eastwards, to, the, lands, of, the, itsekiri, people, in, the, western, niger, delta, around, the, formosa, benin, and, escravos, river, estuaries, this, span, of, land, inhabited, by, geographically, contiguous, and, culturally, related, subgroups, were, divided, into, separate, national, and, subnational, units, under, the, control, of, different, european, powers, as, a, result, of, the, berlin, conference, in, 19th, century, europe, and, the, resultant, administration, the, yoruba, also, notably, developed, a, common, identity, under, the, influence, of, oyo, a, regional, empire, that, developed, in, the, northwestern, savanna, section, of, yorubaland, as, a, result, of, a, kingdom, founding, migration, from, ife, as, opposed, to, oyo, which, was, a, highly, militaristic, grassland, polity, the, ife, empire, was, forest, based, and, spread, its, influence, rather, through, religion, politics, philosophical, ideology, and, commerce, between, 1200, and, the, mid, 1400s, with, the, decline, of, ife, oyo, expanded, as, the, new, yoruba, power, and, established, its, own, influences, over, kingdoms, stretching, from, central, togo, in, the, west, to, central, yorubaland, in, the, east, and, from, the, niger, river, in, the, north, to, the, atlantic, coast, in, the, south, taking, in, the, whole, of, dahomey, southern, borgu, the, mahi, states, southern, nupe, and, the, aja, people, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, oyo, had, numerous, campaigns, in, the, region, and, established, a, reputation, among, the, neighbouring, kingdoms, of, ashanti, dahomey, borgu, nupe, igala, and, benin, as, well, as, further, afield, in, the, lands, of, the, songhai, hausa, kingdoms, and, others, solidifying, its, place, in, the, greater, region, as, a, powerhouse, strategically, placed, between, the, forest, and, the, savanna, and,

townships, consisting, of, a, town, and, its, outlying, dependent, villages, such, as, oke, odan, ado, igbessa, various, other, cultural, factors, which, bind, the, yoruba, people, include, historic, dynastic, migrations, of, royals, and, the, micro, migrations, of, people, within, the, yoruba, cultural, space, which, has, led, to, the, mixing, of, people, evidenced, by, the, duplication, and, multiplication, of, place, names, and, royal, titles, across, yoruba, country, today, places, with, names, containing, owu, ifon, ife, ado, etc, can, be, found, scattered, across, yorubaland,

though, real, political, legislative, and, judicial, powers, resided, with, the, ogboni, a, council, of, notable, elders, the, notion, of, the, divine, king, was, so, important, to, the, yoruba, however, that, it, has, been, part, of, their, organization, in, its, various, forms, from, their, antiquity, to, the, contemporary, era, during, the, internecine, wars, of, the, 19th, century, the,
