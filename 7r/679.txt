socialism, is, an, economic, and, political, philosophy, encompassing, diverse, economic, and, social, systems, characterised, by, social, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, as, opposed, to, private, ownership, it, describes, the, economic, political, and, social, theories, and, movements, associated, with, the, implementation, of, such, systems, social, ownership, can, take, various, forms, including, public, community, collective, cooperative, or, employee, as, one, of, the, main, ideologies, on, the, political, spectrum, socialism, is, considered, the, standard, left, wing, ideology, in, most, countries, of, the, world, types, of, socialism, vary, based, on, the, role, of, markets, and, planning, in, resource, allocation, and, the, structure, of, management, in, organizations, socialist, systems, divide, into, non, market, and, market, forms, a, non, market, socialist, system, seeks, to, eliminate, the, perceived, inefficiencies, irrationalities, unpredictability, and, crises, that, socialists, traditionally, associate, with, capital, accumulation, and, the, profit, system, market, socialism, retains, the, use, of, monetary, prices, factor, markets, and, sometimes, the, profit, motive, socialist, parties, and, ideas, remain, a, political, force, with, varying, degrees, of, power, and, influence, heading, national, governments, in, several, countries, socialist, politics, have, been, internationalist, and, nationalist, organised, through, political, parties, and, opposed, to, party, politics, at, times, overlapping, with, trade, unions, and, other, times, independent, and, critical, of, them, and, present, in, industrialised, and, developing, nations, social, democracy, originated, within, the, socialist, movement, supporting, economic, and, social, interventions, to, promote, social, justice, while, retaining, socialism, as, a, long, term, goal, in, the, post, war, period, social, democracy, embraced, a, mixed, economy, based, on, keynesianism, within, a, predominantly, developed, capitalist, market, economy, and, liberal, democratic, polity, that, expands, state, intervention, to, include, income, redistribution, regulation, and, a, welfare, state, the, socialist, political, movement, includes, political, philosophies, that, originated, in, the, revolutionary, movements, of, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, and, out, of, concern, for, the, social, problems, that, socialists, associated, with, capitalism, by, the, late, 19th, century, after, the, work, of, karl, marx, and, his, collaborator, friedrich, engels, socialism, had, come, to, signify, anti, capitalism, and, advocacy, for, a, post, capitalist, system, based, on, some, form, of, social, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, by, the, early, 1920s, communism, and, social, democracy, had, become, the, two, dominant, political, tendencies, within, the, international, socialist, movement, with, socialism, itself, becoming, the, most, influential, secular, movement, of, the, 20th, century, many, socialists, also, adopted, the, causes, of, other, social, movements, such, as, feminism, environmentalism, and, progressivism, while, the, emergence, of, the, soviet, union, as, the, world, s, first, nominally, socialist, state, led, to, socialism, s, widespread, association, with, the, soviet, economic, model, academics, have, noted, that, some, western, european, countries, have, been, governed, by, socialist, parties, or, have, mixed, economies, that, are, sometimes, called, democratic, socialist, following, the, revolutions, of, 1989, many, of, these, countries, moved, away, from, socialism, as, a, neoliberal, consensus, replaced, the, social, democratic, consensus, in, the, advanced, capitalist, world, while, many, former, socialist, politicians, and, political, parties, embraced, third, way, politics, remaining, committed, to, equality, and, welfare, while, abandoning, public, ownership, and, class, based, politics, socialism, experienced, a, resurgence, in, popularity, in, the, 2010s, most, prominently, in, the, form, of, democratic, socialism, according, to, andrew, vincent, he, word, socialism, finds, its, root, in, the, latin, sociare, which, means, to, combine, or, to, share, the, related, more, technical, term, in, roman, and, then, medieval, law, was, societas, this, latter, word, could, mean, companionship, and, fellowship, as, well, as, the, more, legalistic, idea, of, a, consensual, contract, between, freemen, initial, use, of, socialism, was, claimed, by, pierre, leroux, who, alleged, he, first, used, the, term, in, the, parisian, journal, le, globe, in, 1832, leroux, was, a, follower, of, henri, de, saint, simon, one, of, the, founders, of, what, would, later, be, labelled, utopian, socialism, socialism, contrasted, with, the, liberal, doctrine, of, individualism, that, emphasized, the, moral, worth, of, the, individual, while, stressing, that, people, act, or, should, act, as, if, they, are, in, isolation, from, one, another, the, original, utopian, socialists, condemned, this, doctrine, of, individualism, for, failing, to, address, social, concerns, during, the, industrial, revolution, including, poverty, oppression, and, vast, wealth, inequality, they, viewed, their, society, as, harming, community, life, by, basing, society, on, competition, they, presented, socialism, as, an, alternative, to, liberal, individualism, based, on, the, shared, ownership, of, resources, saint, simon, proposed, economic, planning, scientific, administration, and, the, application, of, scientific, understanding, to, the, organisation, of, society, by, contrast, robert, owen, proposed, to, organise, production, and, ownership, via, cooperatives, socialism, is, also, attributed, in, france, to, marie, roch, louis, reybaud, while, in, britain, it, is, attributed, to, owen, who, became, one, of, the, fathers, of, the, cooperative, movement, the, definition, and, usage, of, socialism, settled, by, the, 1860s, with, the, term, socialist, replacing, associationist, co, operative, mutualist, and, collectivist, which, had, been, used, as, synonyms, while, the, term, communism, fell, out, of, use, during, this, period, an, early, distinction, between, communism, and, socialism, was, that, the, latter, aimed, to, only, socialise, production, while, the, former, aimed, to, socialise, both, production, and, consumption, in, the, form, of, free, access, to, final, goods, by, 1888, marxists, employed, socialism, in, place, of, communism, as, the, latter, had, come, to, be, considered, an, old, fashioned, synonym, for, socialism, it, was, not, until, after, the, bolshevik, revolution, that, socialism, was, appropriated, by, vladimir, lenin, to, mean, a, stage, between, capitalism, and, communism, he, used, it, to, defend, the, bolshevik, program, from, marxist, criticism, that, russia, s, productive, forces, were, not, sufficiently, developed, for, communism, the, distinction, between, communism, and, socialism, became, salient, in, 1918, after, the, russian, social, democratic, labour, party, renamed, itself, to, the, all, russian, communist, party, interpreting, communism, specifically, to, mean, socialists, who, supported, the, politics, and, theories, of, bolshevism, leninism, and, later, that, of, marxism, leninism, although, communist, parties, continued, to, describe, themselves, as, socialists, dedicated, to, socialism, according, to, the, oxford, handbook, of, karl, marx, marx, used, many, terms, to, refer, to, a, post, capitalist, society, positive, humanism, socialism, communism, realm, of, free, individuality, free, association, of, producers, etc, he, used, these, terms, completely, interchangeably, the, notion, that, socialism, and, communism, are, distinct, historical, stages, is, alien, to, his, work, and, only, entered, the, lexicon, of, marxism, after, his, death, in, christian, europe, communists, were, believed, to, have, adopted, atheism, in, protestant, england, communism, was, too, close, to, the, roman, catholic, communion, rite, hence, socialist, was, the, preferred, term, engels, wrote, that, in, 1848, when, the, communist, manifesto, was, published, socialism, was, respectable, in, europe, while, communism, was, not, the, owenites, in, england, and, the, fourierists, in, france, were, considered, respectable, socialists, while, working, class, movements, that, proclaimed, the, necessity, of, total, social, change, denoted, themselves, communists, this, branch, of, socialism, produced, the, communist, work, of, tienne, cabet, in, france, and, wilhelm, weitling, in, germany, british, moral, philosopher, john, stuart, mill, discussed, a, form, of, economic, socialism, within, free, market, in, later, editions, of, his, principles, of, political, economy, 1848, mill, posited, that, as, far, as, economic, theory, was, concerned, there, is, nothing, in, principle, in, economic, theory, that, precludes, an, economic, order, based, on, socialist, policies, and, promoted, substituting, capitalist, businesses, with, worker, cooperatives, while, democrats, looked, to, the, revolutions, of, 1848, as, a, democratic, revolution, which, in, the, long, run, ensured, liberty, equality, and, fraternity, marxists, denounced, it, as, a, betrayal, of, working, class, ideals, by, a, bourgeoisie, indifferent, to, the, proletariat, the, history, of, socialism, has, its, origins, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, the, 1789, french, revolution, along, with, the, changes, that, brought, although, it, has, precedents, in, earlier, movements, and, ideas, the, communist, manifesto, was, written, by, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, in, 1847, 48, just, before, the, revolutions, of, 1848, swept, europe, expressing, what, they, termed, scientific, socialism, in, the, last, third, of, the, 19th, century, parties, dedicated, to, democratic, socialism, arose, in, europe, drawing, mainly, from, marxism, the, australian, labor, party, was, the, first, elected, socialist, party, when, it, formed, government, in, the, colony, of, queensland, for, a, week, in, 1899, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, soviet, union, and, the, communist, parties, of, the, third, international, around, the, world, came, to, represent, socialism, in, terms, of, the, soviet, model, of, economic, development, and, the, creation, of, centrally, planned, economies, directed, by, a, state, that, owns, all, the, means, of, production, although, other, trends, condemned, what, they, saw, as, the, lack, of, democracy, the, establishment, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, saw, socialism, introduced, china, experienced, land, redistribution, and, the, anti, rightist, movement, followed, by, the, disastrous, great, leap, forward, in, the, uk, herbert, morrison, said, that, socialism, is, what, the, labour, government, does, whereas, aneurin, bevan, argued, socialism, requires, that, the, main, streams, of, economic, activity, are, brought, under, public, direction, with, an, economic, plan, and, workers, democracy, some, argued, that, capitalism, had, been, abolished, socialist, governments, established, the, mixed, economy, with, partial, nationalisations, and, social, welfare, by, 1968, the, prolonged, vietnam, war, gave, rise, to, the, new, left, socialists, who, tended, to, be, critical, of, the, soviet, union, and, social, democracy, anarcho, syndicalists, and, some, elements, of, the, new, left, and, others, favoured, decentralised, collective, ownership, in, the, form, of, cooperatives, or, workers, councils, in, 1989, the, soviet, union, saw, the, end, of, communism, marked, by, the, revolutions, of, 1989, across, eastern, europe, culminating, in, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, socialists, have, adopted, the, causes, of, other, social, movements, such, as, environmentalism, feminism, and, progressivism, in, 1990, the, s, o, paulo, forum, was, launched, by, the, workers, party, brazil, linking, left, wing, socialist, parties, in, latin, america, its, members, were, associated, with, the, pink, tide, of, left, wing, governments, on, the, continent, in, the, early, 21st, century, member, parties, ruling, countries, included, the, front, for, victory, in, argentina, the, pais, alliance, in, ecuador, farabundo, mart, national, liberation, front, in, el, salvador, peru, wins, in, peru, and, the, united, socialist, party, of, venezuela, whose, leader, hugo, ch, vez, initiated, what, he, called, socialism, of, the, 21st, century, many, mainstream, democratic, socialist, and, social, democratic, parties, continued, to, drift, right, wards, on, the, right, of, the, socialist, movement, the, progressive, alliance, was, founded, in, 2013, by, current, or, former, members, of, the, socialist, international, the, organisation, states, the, aim, of, becoming, the, global, network, of, the, progressive, democratic, social, democratic, socialist, and, labour, movement, mainstream, social, democratic, and, socialist, parties, are, also, networked, in, europe, in, the, party, of, european, socialists, formed, in, 1992, many, of, these, parties, lost, large, parts, of, their, electoral, base, in, the, early, 21st, century, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, pasokification, from, the, greek, party, pasok, which, saw, a, declining, share, of, the, vote, in, national, elections, from, 43, 9, in, 2009, to, 13, 2, in, may, 2012, to, 12, 3, in, june, 2012, and, 4, 7, in, 2015, due, to, its, poor, handling, of, the, greek, government, debt, crisis, and, implementation, of, harsh, austerity, measures, in, europe, the, share, of, votes, for, such, socialist, parties, was, at, its, 70, year, lowest, in, 2015, for, example, the, socialist, party, after, winning, the, 2012, french, presidential, election, rapidly, lost, its, vote, share, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, s, fortunes, declined, rapidly, from, 2005, to, 2019, and, outside, europe, the, israeli, labor, party, fell, from, being, the, dominant, force, in, israeli, politics, to, 4, 43, of, the, vote, in, the, april, 2019, israeli, legislative, election, and, the, peruvian, aprista, party, went, from, ruling, party, in, 2011, to, a, minor, party, the, decline, of, these, mainstream, parties, opened, space, for, more, radical, and, populist, left, parties, in, some, countries, such, as, spain, s, podemos, greece, s, syriza, in, government, 2015, 19, germany, s, die, linke, and, france, s, la, france, insoumise, in, other, countries, left, wing, revivals, have, taken, place, within, mainstream, democratic, socialist, and, centrist, parties, as, with, jeremy, corbyn, in, the, united, kingdom, and, bernie, sanders, in, the, united, states, few, of, these, radical, left, parties, have, won, national, government, in, europe, while, some, more, mainstream, socialist, parties, have, managed, to, such, as, portugal, s, socialist, party, bhaskar, sunkara, the, founding, editor, of, the, american, socialist, magazine, jacobin, argued, that, the, appeal, of, socialism, persists, due, to, the, inequality, and, tremendous, suffering, under, current, global, capitalism, the, use, of, wage, labor, which, rests, on, the, exploitation, and, domination, of, humans, by, other, humans, and, ecological, crises, such, as, climate, change, in, contrast, mark, j, perry, of, the, conservative, american, enterprise, institute, aei, argued, that, despite, socialism, s, resurgence, it, is, still, a, flawed, system, based, on, completely, faulty, principles, that, aren, t, consistent, with, human, behavior, and, can, t, nurture, the, human, spirit, adding, that, while, it, promised, prosperity, equality, and, security, it, delivered, poverty, misery, and, tyranny, some, in, the, scientific, community, have, suggested, that, a, contemporary, radical, response, to, social, and, ecological, problems, could, be, seen, in, the, emergence, of, movements, associated, with, degrowth, eco, socialism, and, eco, anarchism, early, socialist, thought, took, influences, from, a, diverse, range, of, philosophies, such, as, civic, republicanism, enlightenment, rationalism, romanticism, forms, of, materialism, christianity, both, catholic, and, protestant, natural, law, and, natural, rights, theory, utilitarianism, and, liberal, political, economy, another, philosophical, basis, for, a, great, deal, of, early, socialism, was, the, emergence, of, positivism, during, the, european, enlightenment, positivism, held, that, both, the, natural, and, social, worlds, could, be, understood, through, scientific, knowledge, and, be, analysed, using, scientific, methods, the, fundamental, objective, of, socialism, is, to, attain, an, advanced, level, of, material, production, and, therefore, greater, productivity, efficiency, and, rationality, as, compared, to, capitalism, and, all, previous, systems, under, the, view, that, an, expansion, of, human, productive, capability, is, the, basis, for, the, extension, of, freedom, and, equality, in, society, many, forms, of, socialist, theory, hold, that, human, behaviour, is, largely, shaped, by, the, social, environment, in, particular, socialism, holds, that, social, mores, values, cultural, traits, and, economic, practices, are, social, creations, and, not, the, result, of, an, immutable, natural, law, the, object, of, their, critique, is, thus, not, human, avarice, or, human, consciousness, but, the, material, conditions, and, man, made, social, systems, i, e, the, economic, structure, of, society, which, give, rise, to, observed, social, problems, and, inefficiencies, bertrand, russell, often, considered, to, be, the, father, of, analytic, philosophy, identified, as, a, socialist, russell, opposed, the, class, struggle, aspects, of, marxism, viewing, socialism, solely, as, an, adjustment, of, economic, relations, to, accommodate, modern, machine, production, to, benefit, all, of, humanity, through, the, progressive, reduction, of, necessary, work, time, socialists, view, creativity, as, an, essential, aspect, of, human, nature, and, define, freedom, as, a, state, of, being, where, individuals, are, able, to, express, their, creativity, unhindered, by, constraints, of, both, material, scarcity, and, coercive, social, institutions, the, socialist, concept, of, individuality, is, intertwined, with, the, concept, of, individual, creative, expression, karl, marx, believed, that, expansion, of, the, productive, forces, and, technology, was, the, basis, for, the, expansion, of, human, freedom, and, that, socialism, being, a, system, that, is, consistent, with, modern, developments, in, technology, would, enable, the, flourishing, of, free, individualities, through, the, progressive, reduction, of, necessary, labour, time, the, reduction, of, necessary, labour, time, to, a, minimum, would, grant, individuals, the, opportunity, to, pursue, the, development, of, their, true, individuality, and, creativity, socialists, argue, that, the, accumulation, of, capital, generates, waste, through, externalities, that, require, costly, corrective, regulatory, measures, they, also, point, out, that, this, process, generates, wasteful, industries, and, practices, that, exist, only, to, generate, sufficient, demand, for, products, such, as, high, pressure, advertisement, to, be, sold, at, a, profit, thereby, creating, rather, than, satisfying, economic, demand, socialists, argue, that, capitalism, consists, of, irrational, activity, such, as, the, purchasing, of, commodities, only, to, sell, at, a, later, time, when, their, price, appreciates, rather, than, for, consumption, even, if, the, commodity, cannot, be, sold, at, a, profit, to, individuals, in, need, and, therefore, a, crucial, criticism, often, made, by, socialists, is, that, making, money, or, accumulation, of, capital, does, not, correspond, to, the, satisfaction, of, demand, the, production, of, use, values, the, fundamental, criterion, for, economic, activity, in, capitalism, is, the, accumulation, of, capital, for, reinvestment, in, production, but, this, spurs, the, development, of, new, non, productive, industries, that, do, not, produce, use, value, and, only, exist, to, keep, the, accumulation, process, afloat, otherwise, the, system, goes, into, crisis, such, as, the, spread, of, the, financial, industry, contributing, to, the, formation, of, economic, bubbles, such, accumulation, and, reinvestment, when, it, demands, a, constant, rate, of, profit, causes, problems, if, the, earnings, in, the, rest, of, society, do, not, increase, in, proportion, socialists, view, private, property, relations, as, limiting, the, potential, of, productive, forces, in, the, economy, according, to, socialists, private, property, becomes, obsolete, when, it, concentrates, into, centralised, socialised, institutions, based, on, private, appropriation, of, revenue, but, based, on, cooperative, work, and, internal, planning, in, allocation, of, inputs, until, the, role, of, the, capitalist, becomes, redundant, with, no, need, for, capital, accumulation, and, a, class, of, owners, private, property, in, the, means, of, production, is, perceived, as, being, an, outdated, form, of, economic, organisation, that, should, be, replaced, by, a, free, association, of, individuals, based, on, public, or, common, ownership, of, these, socialised, assets, private, ownership, imposes, constraints, on, planning, leading, to, uncoordinated, economic, decisions, that, result, in, business, fluctuations, unemployment, and, a, tremendous, waste, of, material, resources, during, crisis, of, overproduction, excessive, disparities, in, income, distribution, lead, to, social, instability, and, require, costly, corrective, measures, in, the, form, of, redistributive, taxation, which, incurs, heavy, administrative, costs, while, weakening, the, incentive, to, work, inviting, dishonesty, and, increasing, the, likelihood, of, tax, evasion, while, the, corrective, measures, reduce, the, overall, efficiency, of, the, market, economy, these, corrective, policies, limit, the, incentive, system, of, the, market, by, providing, things, such, as, minimum, wages, unemployment, insurance, taxing, profits, and, reducing, the, reserve, army, of, labour, resulting, in, reduced, incentives, for, capitalists, to, invest, in, more, production, in, essence, social, welfare, policies, cripple, capitalism, and, its, incentive, system, and, are, thus, unsustainable, in, the, long, run, marxists, argue, that, the, establishment, of, a, socialist, mode, of, production, is, the, only, way, to, overcome, these, deficiencies, socialists, and, specifically, marxian, socialists, argue, that, the, inherent, conflict, of, interests, between, the, working, class, and, capital, prevent, optimal, use, of, available, human, resources, and, leads, to, contradictory, interest, groups, labour, and, business, striving, to, influence, the, state, to, intervene, in, the, economy, in, their, favour, at, the, expense, of, overall, economic, efficiency, early, socialists, utopian, socialists, and, ricardian, socialists, criticised, capitalism, for, concentrating, power, and, wealth, within, a, small, segment, of, society, in, addition, they, complained, that, capitalism, does, not, use, available, technology, and, resources, to, their, maximum, potential, in, the, interests, of, the, public, at, a, certain, stage, of, development, the, material, productive, forces, of, society, come, into, conflict, with, the, existing, relations, of, production, or, this, merely, expresses, the, same, thing, in, legal, terms, with, the, property, relations, within, the, framework, of, which, they, have, operated, hitherto, then, begins, an, era, of, social, revolution, the, changes, in, the, economic, foundation, lead, sooner, or, later, to, the, transformation, of, the, whole, immense, superstructure, karl, marx, critique, of, the, gotha, program, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, argued, that, socialism, would, emerge, from, historical, necessity, as, capitalism, rendered, itself, obsolete, and, unsustainable, from, increasing, internal, contradictions, emerging, from, the, development, of, the, productive, forces, and, technology, it, was, these, advances, in, the, productive, forces, combined, with, the, old, social, relations, of, production, of, capitalism, that, would, generate, contradictions, leading, to, working, class, consciousness, marx, and, engels, held, the, view, that, the, consciousness, of, those, who, earn, a, wage, or, salary, the, working, class, in, the, broadest, marxist, sense, would, be, moulded, by, their, conditions, of, wage, slavery, leading, to, a, tendency, to, seek, their, freedom, or, emancipation, by, overthrowing, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, by, capitalists, and, consequently, overthrowing, the, state, that, upheld, this, economic, order, for, marx, and, engels, conditions, determine, consciousness, and, ending, the, role, of, the, capitalist, class, leads, eventually, to, a, classless, society, in, which, the, state, would, wither, away, marx, and, engels, used, the, terms, socialism, and, communism, interchangeably, but, many, later, marxists, defined, socialism, as, a, specific, historical, phase, that, would, displace, capitalism, and, precede, communism, the, major, characteristics, of, socialism, particularly, as, conceived, by, marx, and, engels, after, the, paris, commune, of, 1871, are, that, the, proletariat, would, control, the, means, of, production, through, a, workers, state, erected, by, the, workers, in, their, interests, for, orthodox, marxists, socialism, is, the, lower, stage, of, communism, based, on, the, principle, of, from, each, according, to, his, ability, to, each, according, to, his, contribution, while, upper, stage, communism, is, based, on, the, principle, of, from, each, according, to, his, ability, to, each, according, to, his, need, the, upper, stage, becoming, possible, only, after, the, socialist, stage, further, develops, economic, efficiency, and, the, automation, of, production, has, led, to, a, superabundance, of, goods, and, services, marx, argued, that, the, material, productive, forces, in, industry, and, commerce, brought, into, existence, by, capitalism, predicated, a, cooperative, society, since, production, had, become, a, mass, social, collective, activity, of, the, working, class, to, create, commodities, but, with, private, ownership, the, relations, of, production, or, property, relations, this, conflict, between, collective, effort, in, large, factories, and, private, ownership, would, bring, about, a, conscious, desire, in, the, working, class, to, establish, collective, ownership, commensurate, with, the, collective, efforts, their, daily, experience, socialists, have, taken, different, perspectives, on, the, state, and, the, role, it, should, play, in, revolutionary, struggles, in, constructing, socialism, and, within, an, established, socialist, economy, in, the, 19th, century, the, philosophy, of, state, socialism, was, first, explicitly, expounded, by, the, german, political, philosopher, ferdinand, lassalle, in, contrast, to, karl, marx, s, perspective, of, the, state, lassalle, rejected, the, concept, of, the, state, as, a, class, based, power, structure, whose, main, function, was, to, preserve, existing, class, structures, lassalle, also, rejected, the, marxist, view, that, the, state, was, destined, to, wither, away, lassalle, considered, the, state, to, be, an, entity, independent, of, class, allegiances, and, an, instrument, of, justice, that, would, therefore, be, essential, for, achieving, socialism, preceding, the, bolshevik, led, revolution, in, russia, many, socialists, including, reformists, orthodox, marxist, currents, such, as, council, communism, anarchists, and, libertarian, socialists, criticised, the, idea, of, using, the, state, to, conduct, central, planning, and, own, the, means, of, production, as, a, way, to, establish, socialism, following, the, victory, of, leninism, in, russia, the, idea, of, state, socialism, spread, rapidly, throughout, the, socialist, movement, and, eventually, state, socialism, came, to, be, identified, with, the, soviet, economic, model, joseph, schumpeter, rejected, the, association, of, socialism, and, social, ownership, with, state, ownership, over, the, means, of, production, because, the, state, as, it, exists, in, its, current, form, is, a, product, of, capitalist, society, and, cannot, be, transplanted, to, a, different, institutional, framework, schumpeter, argued, that, there, would, be, different, institutions, within, socialism, than, those, that, exist, within, modern, capitalism, just, as, feudalism, had, its, own, distinct, and, unique, institutional, forms, the, state, along, with, concepts, like, property, and, taxation, were, concepts, exclusive, to, commercial, society, capitalism, and, attempting, to, place, them, within, the, context, of, a, future, socialist, society, would, amount, to, a, distortion, of, these, concepts, by, using, them, out, of, context, utopian, socialism, is, a, term, used, to, define, the, first, currents, of, modern, socialist, thought, as, exemplified, by, the, work, of, henri, de, saint, simon, charles, fourier, and, robert, owen, which, inspired, karl, marx, and, other, early, socialists, visions, of, imaginary, ideal, societies, which, competed, with, revolutionary, social, democratic, movements, were, viewed, as, not, being, grounded, in, the, material, conditions, of, society, and, as, reactionary, although, it, is, technically, possible, for, any, set, of, ideas, or, any, person, living, at, any, time, in, history, to, be, a, utopian, socialist, the, term, is, most, often, applied, to, those, socialists, who, lived, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, who, were, ascribed, the, label, utopian, by, later, socialists, as, a, negative, term, to, imply, naivete, and, dismiss, their, ideas, as, fanciful, or, unrealistic, religious, sects, whose, members, live, communally, such, as, the, hutterites, are, not, usually, called, utopian, socialists, although, their, way, of, living, is, a, prime, example, they, have, been, categorised, as, religious, socialists, by, some, similarly, modern, intentional, communities, based, on, socialist, ideas, could, also, be, categorised, as, utopian, socialist, for, marxists, the, development, of, capitalism, in, western, europe, provided, a, material, basis, for, the, possibility, of, bringing, about, socialism, because, according, to, the, communist, manifesto, hat, the, bourgeoisie, produces, above, all, is, its, own, grave, diggers, namely, the, working, class, which, must, become, conscious, of, the, historical, objectives, set, it, by, society, revolutionary, socialists, believe, that, a, social, revolution, is, necessary, to, effect, structural, changes, to, the, socioeconomic, structure, of, society, among, revolutionary, socialists, there, are, differences, in, strategy, theory, and, the, definition, of, revolution, orthodox, marxists, and, left, communists, take, an, impossibilist, stance, believing, that, revolution, should, be, spontaneous, as, a, result, of, contradictions, in, society, due, to, technological, changes, in, the, productive, forces, lenin, theorised, that, under, capitalism, the, workers, cannot, achieve, class, consciousness, beyond, organising, into, trade, unions, and, making, demands, of, the, capitalists, therefore, leninists, argue, that, it, is, historically, necessary, for, a, vanguard, of, class, conscious, revolutionaries, to, take, a, central, role, in, coordinating, the, social, revolution, to, overthrow, the, capitalist, state, and, eventually, the, institution, of, the, state, altogether, revolution, is, not, necessarily, defined, by, revolutionary, socialists, as, violent, insurrection, but, as, a, complete, dismantling, and, rapid, transformation, of, all, areas, of, class, society, led, by, the, majority, of, the, masses, the, working, class, reformism, is, generally, associated, with, social, democracy, and, gradualist, democratic, socialism, reformism, is, the, belief, that, socialists, should, stand, in, parliamentary, elections, within, capitalist, society, and, if, elected, use, the, machinery, of, government, to, pass, political, and, social, reforms, for, the, purposes, of, ameliorating, the, instabilities, and, inequities, of, capitalism, within, socialism, reformism, is, used, in, two, different, ways, one, has, no, intention, of, bringing, about, socialism, or, fundamental, economic, change, to, society, and, is, used, to, oppose, such, structural, changes, the, other, is, based, on, the, assumption, that, while, reforms, are, not, socialist, in, themselves, they, can, help, rally, supporters, to, the, cause, of, revolution, by, popularizing, the, cause, of, socialism, to, the, working, class, the, debate, on, the, ability, for, social, democratic, reformism, to, lead, to, a, socialist, transformation, of, society, is, over, a, century, old, reformism, is, criticized, for, being, paradoxical, as, it, seeks, to, overcome, the, existing, economic, system, of, capitalism, while, trying, to, improve, the, conditions, of, capitalism, thereby, making, it, appear, more, tolerable, to, society, according, to, rosa, luxemburg, capitalism, is, not, overthrown, but, is, on, the, contrary, strengthened, by, the, development, of, social, reforms, in, a, similar, vein, stan, parker, of, the, socialist, party, of, great, britain, argues, that, reforms, are, a, diversion, of, energy, for, socialists, and, are, limited, because, they, must, adhere, to, the, logic, of, capitalism, french, social, theorist, andr, gorz, criticized, reformism, by, advocating, a, third, alternative, to, reformism, and, social, revolution, that, he, called, non, reformist, reforms, specifically, focused, on, structural, changes, to, capitalism, as, opposed, to, reforms, to, improve, living, conditions, within, capitalism, or, to, prop, it, up, through, economic, interventions, under, socialism, solidarity, will, be, the, basis, of, society, literature, and, art, will, be, tuned, to, a, different, key, trotsky, literature, and, revolution, 1924, in, the, leninist, conception, the, role, of, the, vanguard, party, was, to, politically, educate, the, workers, and, peasants, to, dispel, the, societal, false, consciousness, of, institutional, religion, and, nationalism, that, constitute, the, cultural, status, quo, taught, by, the, bourgeoisie, to, the, proletariat, to, facilitate, their, economic, exploitation, of, peasants, and, workers, influenced, by, lenin, the, central, committee, of, the, bolshevik, party, stated, that, the, development, of, the, socialist, workers, culture, should, not, be, hamstrung, from, above, and, opposed, the, proletkult, 1917, 1925, organisational, control, of, the, national, culture, similarly, trotsky, viewed, the, party, as, transmitters, of, culture, to, the, masses, for, raising, the, standards, of, education, as, well, as, entry, into, the, cultural, sphere, but, that, the, process, of, artistic, creation, in, terms, of, language, and, presentation, should, be, the, domain, of, the, practitioner, according, to, political, scientist, baruch, knei, paz, in, his, book, the, social, and, political, thought, of, leon, trotsky, this, represented, one, of, several, distinctions, between, trotsky, s, approach, on, cultural, matters, and, stalin, s, policy, in, the, 1930s, in, literature, and, revolution, trotsky, examined, aesthetic, issues, in, relation, to, class, and, the, russian, revolution, soviet, scholar, robert, bird, considered, his, work, as, the, first, systematic, treatment, of, art, by, a, communist, leader, and, a, catalyst, for, later, marxist, cultural, and, critical, theories, he, would, later, co, author, the, 1938, manifesto, for, an, independent, revolutionary, art, with, the, endorsement, of, prominent, artists, andre, breton, and, diego, rivera, trotsky, s, writings, on, literature, such, as, his, 1923, survey, which, advocated, tolerance, limited, censorship, and, respect, for, literary, tradition, had, strong, appeal, to, the, new, york, intellectuals, prior, to, stalin, s, rule, literary, religious, and, national, representatives, had, some, level, of, autonomy, in, soviet, russia, throughout, the, 1920s, but, these, groups, were, later, rigorously, repressed, during, the, stalinist, era, socialist, realism, was, imposed, under, stalin, in, artistic, production, and, other, creative, industries, such, as, music, film, along, with, sports, were, subject, to, extreme, levels, of, political, control, the, counter, cultural, phenomenon, which, emerged, in, the, 1960s, shaped, the, intellectual, and, radical, outlook, of, the, new, left, this, movement, placed, a, heavy, emphasis, on, anti, racism, anti, imperialism, and, direct, democracy, in, opposition, to, the, dominant, culture, of, advanced, industrial, capitalism, socialist, groups, have, also, been, closely, involved, with, a, number, of, counter, cultural, movements, such, as, vietnam, solidarity, campaign, stop, the, war, coalition, love, music, hate, racism, anti, nazi, league, and, unite, against, fascism, the, economic, anarchy, of, capitalist, society, as, it, exists, today, is, in, my, opinion, the, real, source, of, the, evil, i, am, convinced, there, is, only, one, way, to, eliminate, these, grave, evils, namely, through, the, establishment, of, a, socialist, economy, accompanied, by, an, educational, system, which, would, be, oriented, toward, social, goals, in, such, an, economy, the, means, of, production, are, owned, by, society, itself, and, are, utilised, in, a, planned, fashion, a, planned, economy, which, adjusts, production, to, the, needs, of, the, community, would, distribute, the, work, to, be, done, among, all, those, able, to, work, and, would, guarantee, a, livelihood, to, every, man, woman, and, child, the, education, of, the, individual, in, addition, to, promoting, his, own, innate, abilities, would, attempt, to, develop, in, him, a, sense, of, responsibility, for, his, fellow, men, in, place, of, the, glorification, of, power, and, success, in, our, present, society, albert, einstein, why, socialism, 1949, socialist, economics, starts, from, the, premise, that, individuals, do, not, live, or, work, in, isolation, but, live, in, cooperation, with, one, another, furthermore, everything, that, people, produce, is, in, some, sense, a, social, product, and, everyone, who, contributes, to, the, production, of, a, good, is, entitled, to, a, share, in, it, society, as, whole, therefore, should, own, or, at, least, control, property, for, the, benefit, of, all, its, members, the, original, conception, of, socialism, was, an, economic, system, whereby, production, was, organised, in, a, way, to, directly, produce, goods, and, services, for, their, utility, or, use, value, in, classical, and, marxian, economics, with, the, direct, allocation, of, resources, in, terms, of, physical, units, as, opposed, to, financial, calculation, and, the, economic, laws, of, capitalism, see, law, of, value, often, entailing, the, end, of, capitalistic, economic, categories,

undertaken, by, engineers, market, socialism, refers, to, an, array, of, different, economic, theories, and, systems, that, use, the, market, mechanism, to, organise, production, and, to, allocate, factor, inputs, among, socially, owned, enterprises, with, the, economic, surplus, profits, accruing, to, society, in, a, social, dividend, as, opposed, to, private, capital, owners, variations, of, market, socialism, include, libertarian, proposals, such, as, mutualism, based, on, classical, economics, and, neoclassical, economic, models, such, as, the, lange, model, some, economists, such, as, joseph, stiglitz, mancur, olson, and, others, not, specifically, advancing, anti, socialists, positions, have, shown, that, prevailing, economic, models, upon, which, such, democratic, or, market, socialism, models, might, be, based, have, logical, flaws, or, unworkable, presuppositions, these, criticisms, have, been, incorporated, into, the, models, of, market, socialism, developed, by, john, roemer, and, nicholas, vrousalis, the, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, can, be, based, on, direct, ownership, by, the, users, of, the, productive, property, through, worker, cooperative, or, commonly, owned, by, all, of, society, with, management, and, control, delegated, to, those, who, operate, use, the, means, of, production, or, public, ownership, by, a, state, apparatus, public, ownership, may, refer, to, the, creation, of, state, owned, enterprises, nationalisation, municipalisation, or, autonomous, collective, institutions, some, socialists, feel, that, in, a, socialist, economy, at, least, the, commanding, heights, of, the, economy, must, be, publicly, owned, economic, liberals, and, right, libertarians, view, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, and, the, market, exchange, as, natural, entities, or, moral, rights, which, are, central, to, their, conceptions, of, freedom, and, liberty, and, view, the, economic, dynamics, of, capitalism, as, immutable, and, absolute, therefore, they, perceive, public, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, cooperatives, and, economic, planning, as, infringements, upon, liberty, management, and, control, over, the, activities, of, enterprises, are, based, on, self, management, and, self, governance, with, equal, power, relations, in, the, workplace, to, maximise, occupational, autonomy, a, socialist, form, of, organisation, would, eliminate, controlling, hierarchies, so, that, only, a, hierarchy, based, on, technical, knowledge, in, the, workplace, remains, every, member, would, have, decision, making, power, in, the, firm, and, would, be, able, to, participate, in, establishing, its, overall, policy, objectives, the, policies, goals, would, be, carried, out, by, the, technical, specialists, that, form, the, coordinating, hierarchy, of, the, firm, who, would, establish, plans, or, directives, for, the, work, community, to, accomplish, these, goals, the, role, and, use, of, money, in, a, hypothetical, socialist, economy, is, a, contested, issue, nineteenth, century, socialists, including, karl, marx, robert, owen, pierre, joseph, proudhon, and, john, stuart, mill, advocated, various, forms, of, labour, vouchers, or, labour, credits, which, like, money, would, be, used, to, acquire, articles, of, consumption, but, unlike, money, they, are, unable, to, become, capital, and, would, not, be, used, to, allocate, resources, within, the, production, process, bolshevik, revolutionary, leon, trotsky, argued, that, money, could, not, be, arbitrarily, abolished, following, a, socialist, revolution, money, had, to, exhaust, its, historic, mission, meaning, it, would, have, to, be, used, until, its, function, became, redundant, eventually, being, transformed, into, bookkeeping, receipts, for, statisticians, and, only, in, the, more, distant, future, would, money, not, be, required, for, even, that, role, a, planned, economy, is, a, type, of, economy, consisting, of, a, mixture, of, public, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, and, the, coordination, of, production, and, distribution, through, economic, planning, a, planned, economy, can, be, either, decentralised, or, centralised, enrico, barone, provided, a, comprehensive, theoretical, framework, for, a, planned, socialist, economy, in, his, model, assuming, perfect, computation, techniques, simultaneous, equations, relating, inputs, and, outputs, to, ratios, of, equivalence, would, provide, appropriate, valuations, to, balance, supply, and, demand, the, most, prominent, example, of, a, planned, economy, was, the, economic, system, of, the, soviet, union, and, as, such, the, centralised, planned, economic, model, is, usually, associated, with, the, communist, states, of, the, 20th, century, where, it, was, combined, with, a, single, party, political, system, in, a, centrally, planned, economy, decisions, regarding, the, quantity, of, goods, and, services, to, be, produced, are, planned, in, advance, by, a, planning, agency, see, also, the, analysis, of, soviet, type, economic, planning, the, economic, systems, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, eastern, bloc, are, further, classified, as, command, economies, which, are, defined, as, systems, where, economic, coordination, is, undertaken, by, commands, directives, and, production, targets, studies, by, economists, of, various, political, persuasions, on, the, actual, functioning, of, the, soviet, economy, indicate, that, it, was, not, actually, a, planned, economy, instead, of, conscious, planning, the, soviet, economy, was, based, on, a, process, whereby, the, plan, was, modified, by, localised, agents, and, the, original, plans, went, largely, unfulfilled, planning, agencies, ministries, and, enterprises, all, adapted, and, bargained, with, each, other, during, the, formulation, of, the, plan, as, opposed, to, following, a, plan, passed, down, from, a, higher, authority, leading, some, economists, to, suggest, that, planning, did, not, actually, take, place, within, the, soviet, economy, and, that, a, better, description, would, be, an, administered, or, managed, economy, although, central, planning, was, largely, supported, by, marxist, leninists, some, factions, within, the, soviet, union, before, the, rise, of, stalinism, held, positions, contrary, to, central, planning, leon, trotsky, rejected, central, planning, in, favour, of, decentralised, planning, he, argued, that, central, planners, regardless, of, their, intellectual, capacity, would, be, unable, to, coordinate, effectively, all, economic, activity, within, an, economy, because, they, operated, without, the, input, and, tacit, knowledge, embodied, by, the, participation, of, the, millions, of, people, in, the, economy, as, a, result, central, planners, would, be, unable, to, respond, to, local, economic, conditions, state, socialism, is, unfeasible, in, this, view, because, information, cannot, be, aggregated, by, a, central, body, and, effectively, used, to, formulate, a, plan, for, an, entire, economy, because, doing, so, would, result, in, distorted, or, absent, price, signals, socialism, you, see, is, a, bird, with, two, wings, the, definition, is, social, ownership, and, democratic, control, of, the, instruments, and, means, of, production, upton, sinclair, a, self, managed, decentralised, economy, is, based, on, autonomous, self, regulating, economic, units, and, a, decentralised, mechanism, of, resource, allocation, and, decision, making, this, model, has, found, support, in, notable, classical, and, neoclassical, economists, including, alfred, marshall, john, stuart, mill, and, jaroslav, vanek, there, are, numerous, variations, of, self, management, including, labour, managed, firms, and, worker, managed, firms, the, goals, of, self, management, are, to, eliminate, exploitation, and, reduce, alienation, guild, socialism, is, a, political, movement, advocating, workers, control, of, industry, through, the, medium, of, trade, related, guilds, in, an, implied, contractual, relationship, with, the, public, it, originated, in, the, united, kingdom, and, was, at, its, most, influential, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, strongly, associated, with, g, d, h, cole, and, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, william, morris, one, such, system, is, the, cooperative, economy, a, largely, free, market, economy, in, which, workers, manage, the, firms, and, democratically, determine, remuneration, levels, and, labour, divisions, productive, resources, would, be, legally, owned, by, the, cooperative, and, rented, to, the, workers, who, would, enjoy, usufruct, rights, another, form, of, decentralised, planning, is, the, use, of, cybernetics, or, the, use, of, computers, to, manage, the, allocation, of, economic, inputs, the, socialist, run, government, of, salvador, allende, in, chile, experimented, with, project, cybersyn, a, real, time, information, bridge, between, the, government, state, enterprises, and, consumers, this, had, been, preceded, by, similar, efforts, to, introduce, a, form, of, cybernetic, economic, planning, as, seen, with, the, proposed, ogas, system, in, the, soviet, union, the, ogas, project, was, conceived, to, oversee, a, nationwide, information, network, but, was, never, implemented, due, to, conflicting, bureaucratic, interests, another, more, recent, variant, is, participatory, economics, wherein, the, economy, is, planned, by, decentralised, councils, of, workers, and, consumers, workers, would, be, remunerated, solely, according, to, effort, and, sacrifice, so, that, those, engaged, in, dangerous, uncomfortable, and, strenuous, work, would, receive, the, highest, incomes, and, could, thereby, work, less, a, contemporary, model, for, a, self, managed, non, market, socialism, is, pat, devine, s, model, of, negotiated, coordination, negotiated,

organising, production, so, that, workers, become, collectively, self, directed, at, their, work, sites, not, only, moves, society, beyond, both, capitalism, and, state, socialism, of, the, last, century, but, would, also, mark, another, milestone, in, human, history, similar, to, earlier, transitions, out, of, slavery, and, feudalism, as, an, example, wolff, claims, that, mondragon, is, a, stunningly, successful, alternative, to, the, capitalist, organisation, of, production, state, socialism, can, be, used, to, classify, any, variety, of, socialist, philosophies, that, advocates, the, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, by, the, state, apparatus, either, as, a, transitional, stage, between, capitalism, and, socialism, or, as, an, end, goal, in, itself, typically, it, refers,

corporations, had, become, increasingly, dynamic, and, generated, large, increases, in, revenue, for, the, state, resulting, in, a, state, sector, led, recovery, during, the, 2009, financial, crises, while, accounting, for, most, of, china, s, economic, growth, the, chinese, economic, model, is, widely, cited, as, a, contemporary, form, of, state, capitalism, the, major, difference, between, western, capitalism, and, the, chinese, model, being, the, degree, of, state, ownership, of, shares, in, publicly, listed, corporations, the, socialist, republic, of, vietnam, has, adopted, a, similar, model, after, the, doi, moi, economic, renovation, but, slightly, differs, from, the, chinese, model, in, that, the, vietnamese, government, retains, firm, control, over, the, state, sector, and, strategic, industries, but, allows, for, private, sector, activity, in, commodity, production, while, major, socialist, political, movements, include, anarchism, communism, the, labour, movement, marxism, social, democracy, and, syndicalism, independent, socialist, theorists, utopian, socialist, authors, and, academic, supporters, of, socialism, may, not, be, represented, in, these, movements, some, political, groups, have, called, themselves, socialist, while, holding, views, that, some, consider, antithetical, to, socialism, socialist, has, been, used, by, members, of, the, political, right, as, an, epithet, including, against, individuals, who, do, not, consider, themselves, to, be, socialists, and, against, policies, that, are, not, considered, socialist, by, their, proponents, while, there, are, many, variations, of, socialism, and, there, is, no, single, definition, encapsulating, all, of, socialism, there, have, been, common, elements, identified, by, scholars, in, his, dictionary, of, socialism, 1924, angelo, s, rappoport, analysed, forty, definitions, of, socialism, to, conclude, that, common, elements, of, socialism, include, general, criticism, of, the, social, effects, of, private, ownership, and, control, of, capital, as, being, the, cause, of, poverty, low, wages, unemployment, economic, and, social, inequality, and, a, lack, of, economic, security, a, general, view, that, the, solution, to, these, problems, is, a, form, of, collective, control, over, the, means, of, production, distribution, and, exchange, the, degree, and, means, of, control, vary, among, socialist, movements, an, agreement, that, the, outcome, of, this, collective, control, should, be, a, society, based, upon, social, justice, including, social, equality, economic, protection, of, people, and, should, provide, a, more, satisfying, life, for, most, people, in, the, concepts, of, socialism, 1975, bhikhu, parekh, identifies, four, core, principles, of, socialism, and, particularly, socialist, society, namely, sociality, social, responsibility, cooperation, and, planning, in, his, study, ideologies, and, political, theory, 1996, michael, freeden, states, that, all, socialists, share, five, themes, the, first, is, that, socialism, posits, that, society, is, more, than, a, mere, collection, of, individuals, second, that, it, considers, human, welfare, a, desirable, objective, third, that, it, considers, humans, by, nature, to, be, active, and, productive, fourth, it, holds, the, belief, of, human, equality, and, fifth, that, history, is, progressive, and, will, create, positive, change, on, the, condition, that, humans, work, to, achieve, such, change, anarchism, advocates, stateless, societies, often, defined, as, self, governed, voluntary, institutions, but, that, several, authors, have, defined, as, more, specific, institutions, based, on, non, hierarchical, free, associations, while, anarchism, holds, the, state, to, be, undesirable, unnecessary, or, harmful, it, is, not, the, central, aspect, anarchism, entails, opposing, authority, or, hierarchical, organisation, in, the, conduct, of, human, relations, including, the, state, system, mutualists, support, market, socialism, collectivist, anarchists, favour, workers, cooperatives, and, salaries, based, on, the, amount, of, time, contributed, to, production, anarcho, communists, advocate, a, direct, transition, from, capitalism, to, libertarian, communism, and, a, gift, economy, and, anarcho, syndicalists, prefer, workers, direct, action, and, the, general, strike, the, authoritarian, libertarian, struggles, and, disputes, within, the, socialist, movement, go, back, to, the, first, international, and, the, expulsion, in, 1872, of, the, anarchists, who, went, on, to, lead, the, anti, authoritarian, international, and, then, founded, their, own, libertarian, international, the, anarchist, st, imier, international, in, 1888, the, individualist, anarchist, benjamin, tucker, who, proclaimed, himself, to, be, an, anarchistic, socialist, and, libertarian, socialist, in, opposition, to, the, authoritarian, state, socialism, and, the, compulsory, communism, included, the, full, text, of, a, socialistic, letter, by, ernest, lesigne, in, his, essay, on, state, socialism, and, anarchism, according, to, lesigne, there, are, two, types, of, socialism, one, is, dictatorial, the, other, libertarian, tucker, s, two, socialisms, were, the, authoritarian, state, socialism, which, he, associated, to, the, marxist, school, and, the, libertarian, anarchist, socialism, or, simply, anarchism, that, he, advocated, tucker, noted, that, the, fact, that, the, authoritarian, state, socialism, has, overshadowed, other, forms, of, socialism, gives, it, no, right, to, a, monopoly, of, the, socialistic, idea, according, to, tucker, what, those, two, schools, of, socialism, had, in, common, was, the, labor, theory, of, value, and, the, ends, by, which, anarchism, pursued, different, means, according, to, anarchists, such, as, the, authors, of, an, anarchist, faq, anarchism, is, one, of, the, many, traditions, of, socialism, for, anarchists, and, other, anti, authoritarian, socialists, socialism, can, only, mean, a, classless, and, anti, authoritarian, i, e, libertarian, society, in, which, people, manage, their, own, affairs, either, as, individuals, or, as, part, of, a, group, depending, on, the, situation, in, other, words, it, implies, self, management, in, all, aspects, of, life, including, at, the, workplace, michael, newman, includes, anarchism, as, one, of, many, socialist, traditions, peter, marshall, argues, that, n, general, anarchism, is, closer, to, socialism, than, liberalism, anarchism, finds, itself, largely, in, the, socialist, camp, but, it, also, has, outriders, in, liberalism, it, cannot, be, reduced, to, socialism, and, is, best, seen, as, a, separate, and, distinctive, doctrine, you, can, t, talk, about, ending, the, slums, without, first, saying, profit, must, be, taken, out, of, slums, you, re, really, tampering, and, getting, on, dangerous, ground, because, you, are, messing, with, folk, then, you, are, messing, with, captains, of, industry, now, this, means, that, we, are, treading, in, difficult, water, because, it, really, means, that, we, are, saying, that, something, is, wrong, with, capitalism, there, must, be, a, better, distribution, of, wealth, and, maybe, america, must, move, toward, a, democratic, socialism, martin, luther, king, jr, 1966, democratic, socialism, represents, any, socialist, movement, that, seeks, to, establish, an, economy, based, on, economic, democracy, by, and, for, the, working, class, democratic, socialism, is, difficult, to, define, and, groups, of, scholars, have, radically, different, definitions, for, the, term, some, definitions, simply, refer, to, all, forms, of, socialism, that, follow, an, electoral, reformist, or, evolutionary, path, to, socialism, rather, than, a, revolutionary, one, according, to, christopher, pierson, f, the, contrast, which, 1989, highlights, is, not, that, between, socialism, in, the, east, and, liberal, democracy, in, the, west, the, latter, must, be, recognised, to, have, been, shaped, reformed, and, compromised, by, a, century, of, social, democratic, pressure, pierson, further, claims, that, social, democratic, and, socialist, parties, within, the, constitutional, arena, in, the, west, have, almost, always, been, involved, in, a, politics, of, compromise, with, existing, capitalist, institutions, to, whatever, far, distant, prize, its, eyes, might, from, time, to, time, have, been, lifted, for, pierson, if, advocates, of, the, death, of, socialism, accept, that, social, democrats, belong, within, the, socialist, camp, as, i, think, they, must, then, the, contrast, between, socialism, in, all, its, variants, and, liberal, democracy, must, collapse, for, actually, existing, liberal, democracy, is, in, substantial, part, a, product, of, socialist, social, democratic, forces, social, democracy, is, a, socialist, tradition, of, political, thought, many, social, democrats, refer, to, themselves, as, socialists, or, democratic, socialists, and, some, such, as, tony, blair, employ, these, terms, interchangeably, others, found, clear, differences, between, the, three, terms, and, prefer, to, describe, their, own, political, beliefs, by, using, the, term, social, democracy, the, two, main, directions, were, to, establish, democratic, socialism, or, to, build, first, a, welfare, state, within, the, capitalist, system, the, first, variant, advances, democratic, socialism, through, reformist, and, gradualist, methods, in, the, second, variant, social, democracy, is, a, policy, regime, involving, a, welfare, state, collective, bargaining, schemes, support, for, publicly, financed, public, services, and, a, mixed, economy, it, is, often, used, in, this, manner, to, refer, to, western, and, northern, europe, during, the, later, half, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, described, by, jerry, mander, as, hybrid, economics, an, active, collaboration, of, capitalist, and, socialist, visions, some, studies, and, surveys, indicate, that, people, tend, to, live, happier, and, healthier, lives, in, social, democratic, societies, rather, than, neoliberal, ones, social, democrats, advocate, a, peaceful, evolutionary, transition, of, the, economy, to, socialism, through, progressive, social, reform, it, asserts, that, the, only,

a, program, of, gradual, legislative, modification, of, capitalism, to, make, it, more, equitable, and, humane, while, the, theoretical, end, goal, of, building, a, socialist, society, is, relegated, to, the, indefinite, future, according, to, sheri, berman, marxism, is, loosely, held, to, be, valuable, for, its, emphasis, on, changing, the, world, for, a, more, just, better, future, the, two, movements, are, widely, similar, both, in, terminology, and, in, ideology, although, there, are, a, few, key, differences, the, major, difference, between, social, democracy, and, democratic, socialism, is, the, object, of, their, politics, in, that, contemporary, social, democrats, support, a, welfare, state, and, unemployment, insurance, as, well, as, other, practical, progressive, reforms, of, capitalism, and, are, more, concerned, to, administrate, and, humanise, it, on, the, other, hand, democratic, socialists, seek, to, replace, capitalism, with, a, socialist, economic,

and, the, various, totalitarian, collectivist, ideologies, which, claim, the, title, of, socialism, as, well, as, the, many, varieties, of, socialism, from, above, which, have, led, in, the,

analytical, marxist, sociologist, erik, olin, wright, the, right, condemned, socialism, as, violating, individual, rights, to, private, property, and, unleashing, monstrous, forms, of, state, oppression, while, the, left, saw, it, as, opening, up, new, vistas, of, social, equality, genuine, freedom, and, the, development, of, human, potentials, because, of, socialism, s, many, varieties, most, critiques, have, focused, on, a, specific, approach, proponents, of, one, approach, typically, criticise, others, socialism, has, been, criticised, in, terms, of, its, models, of, economic, organization, as, well, as, its, political, and, social, implications, other, critiques, are, directed, at, the, socialist, movement, parties, or, existing, states, some, forms, of, criticism, occupy, theoretical, grounds, such, as, in, the, economic, calculation, problem, presented, by, proponents, of, the, austrian, school, as, part, of, the, socialist, calculation, debate, while, others, support, their, criticism, by, examining, historical, attempts, to, establish, socialist, societies, the, economic, calculation, problem, concerns, the, feasibility, and, methods, of, resource, allocation, for, a, planned, socialist, system, central, planning, is, also, criticized, by, elements, of, the, radical, left, libertarian, socialist, economist, robin, hahnel, notes, that, even, if, central, planning, overcame, its, inherent, inhibitions, of, incentives, and, innovation, it, would, nevertheless, be, unable, to, maximize, economic, democracy, and, self, management, which, he, believes, are, concepts, that, are, more, intellectually, coherent, consistent, and, just, than, mainstream, notions, of, economic, freedom, economic, liberals, and, right, libertarians, argue, that, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, and, market, exchange, are, natural, entities, or, moral, rights, which, are, central, to, freedom, and, liberty, and, argue, that, the, economic, dynamics, of, capitalism, are, immutable, and, absolute, as, such, they, also, argue, that, public, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, and, economic, planning, are, infringements, upon, liberty, critics, of, socialism, have, argued, that, in, any, society, where, everyone, holds, equal, wealth, there, can, be, no, material, incentive, to, work, because, one, does, not, receive, rewards, for, a, work, well, done, they, further, argue, that, incentives, increase, productivity, for, all, people, and, that, the, loss, of, those, effects, would, lead, to, stagnation, some, critics, of, socialism, argue, that, income, sharing, reduces, individual, incentives, to, work, and, therefore, incomes, should, be, individualized, as, much, as, possible, some, philosophers, have, also, criticized, the, aims, of, socialism, arguing, that, equality, erodes, away, at, individual, diversities, and, that, the, establishment, of, an, equal, society, would, have, to, entail, strong, coercion, milton, friedman, argued, that, the, absence, of, private, economic, activity, would, enable, political, leaders, to, grant, themselves, coercive, powers, powers, that, under, a, capitalist, system, would, instead, be, granted, by, a, capitalist, class, which, friedman, found, preferable, many, commentators, on, the, political, right, point, to, the, mass, killings, under, communist, regimes, claiming, them, as, an, indictment, of, socialism, opponents, of, this, view, including, supporters, of, socialism, state, that, these, killings, were, aberrations, caused, by, specific, authoritarian, regimes, and, not, caused, by, socialism, itself, and, draw, comparisons, to, killings, famines, and, excess, deaths, under, capitalism, colonialism, and, anti, communist, authoritarian, governments
