textile, manufacturing, or, textile, engineering, is, a, major, industry, it, is, largely, based, on, the, conversion, of, fibre, into, yarn, then, yarn, into, fabric, these, are, then, dyed, or, printed, fabricated, into, cloth, which, is, then, converted, into, useful, goods, such, as, clothing, household, items, upholstery, and, various, industrial, products, different, types, of, fibres, are, used, to, produce, yarn, cotton, remains, the, most, widely, used, and, common, natural, fiber, making, up, 90, of, all, natural, fibers, used, in, the, textile, industry, people, often, use, cotton, clothing, and, accessories, because, of, comfort, not, limited, to, different, weathers, there, are, many, variable, processes, available, at, the, spinning, and, fabric, forming, stages, coupled, with, the, complexities, of, the, finishing, and, colouration, processes, to, the, production, of, a, wide, range, of, products, textile, manufacturing, in, the, modern, era, is, an, evolved, form, of, the, art, and, craft, industries, until, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, textile, industry, was, a, household, work, it, became, mechanised, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, and, has, continued, to, develop, through, science, and, technology, since, the, twentieth, century, specifically, ancient, civilizations, in, india, egypt, china, sub, saharan, africa, eurasia, south, america, and, north, and, east, africa, all, had, some, forms, of, textile, production, the, first, book, about, textile, manufacturing, is, considered, to, be, a, treatise, on, the, art, of, weaving, by, john, murphy, cotton, is, the, world, s, most, important, natural, fibre, in, the, year, 2007, the, global, yield, was, 25, million, tons, from, 35, million, hectares, cultivated, in, more, than, 50, countries, there, are, six, stages, to, the, manufacturing, of, cotton, textiles, cotton, is, grown, in, locations, with, long, hot, dry, summers, with, plenty, of, sunshine, and, low, humidity, indian, cotton, gossypium, arboreum, is, finer, but, the, staple, is, only, suitable, for, hand, processing, american, cotton, gossypium, hirsutum, produces, the, longer, staple, needed, for, mechanised, textile, production, the, planting, season, is, from, september, to, mid, november, and, the, crop, is, harvested, between, march, and, june, the, cotton, bolls, are, harvested, by, stripper, harvesters, and, spindle, pickers, that, remove, the, entire, boll, from, the, plant, the, cotton, boll, is, the, seed, pod, of, the, cotton, plant, attached, to, each, of, the, thousands, of, seeds, are, fibres, about, 2, 5, cm, long, there, is, a, higher, rate, of, cotton, being, produced, compared, to, the, actual, workers, needed, to, produce, the, material, in, 2013, a, cotton, farmer, in, mississippi, bower, flowers, produced, around, 13, 000, bales, of, cotton, in, that, year, alone, this, amount, of, cotton, could, be, used, to, produce, up, to, 9, 4, million, t, shirts, the, seed, cotton, goes, into, a, cotton, gin, the, cotton, gin, separates, seeds, and, removes, the, trash, dirt, stems, and, leaves, from, the, fibre, in, a, saw, gin, circular, saws, grab, the, fibre, and, pull, it, through, a, grating, that, is, too, narrow, for, the, seeds, to, pass, a, roller, gin, is, used, with, longer, staple, cotton, here, a, leather, roller, captures, the, cotton, a, knife, blade, set, close, to, the, roller, detaches, the, seeds, by, drawing, them, through, teeth, in, circular, saws, and, revolving, brushes, which, clean, them, away, the, ginned, cotton, fibre, known, as, lint, is, then, compressed, into, bales, which, are, about, 1, 5, m, tall, and, weigh, almost, 220, kg, only, 33, of, the, crop, is, usable, lint, commercial, cotton, is, graded, and, priced, according, to, its, quality, this, broadly, relates, to, the, average, length, of, the, staple, and, the, variety, of, the, plant, longer, staple, cotton, 2, in, to, 1, in, is, called, egyptian, medium, staple, 1, in, to, in, is, called, american, upland, and, short, staple, less, than, in, is, called, indian, the, cotton, seed, is, pressed, into, cooking, oil, the, husks, and, meal, are, processed, into, animal, feed, and, the, stems, into, paper, ginning, bale, making, and, transportation, are, done, in, the, country, of, origin, cotton, is, shipped, to, mills, in, large, 500, pound, bales, when, the, cotton, comes, out, of, a, bale, it, is, all, packed, together, and, still, contains, vegetable, matter, the, bale, is, broken, open, using, a, machine, with, large, spikes, called, an, opener, to, fluff, up, the, cotton, and, remove, the, vegetable, matter, the, cotton, is, sent, through, a, picker, or, a, similar, machine, in, a, picker, the, cotton, is, beaten, with, a, beater, bar, to, loosen, it, up, it, is, then, fed, through, various, rollers, which, serve, to, remove, the, vegetable, matter, the, cotton, aided, by, fans, then, collects, on, a, screen, and, gets, fed, through, more, rollers, where, it, emerges, as, a, continuous, soft, fleecy, sheet, known, as, a, lap, scutching, refers, to, the, process, of, cleaning, cotton, of, its, seeds, and, other, impurities, the, first, scutching, machine, was, invented, in, 1797, but, did, not, come, into, further, mainstream, use, until, after, 1808, or, 1809, when, it, was, introduced, and, used, in, manchester, england, by, 1816, it, had, become, generally, adopted, the, scutching, machine, worked, by, passing, the, cotton, through, a, pair, of, rollers, and, then, striking, it, with, iron, or, steel, bars, called, beater, bars, or, beaters, the, beaters, which, turn, very, quickly, strike, the, cotton, hard, and, knock, the, seeds, out, this, process, is, done, over, a, series, of, parallel, bars, so, as, to, allow, the, seeds, to, fall, through, at, the, same, time, air, is, blown, across, the, bars, which, carries, the, cotton, into, a, cotton, chamber, in, the, carding, process, the, fibres, are, separated, and, then, assembled, into, a, loose, strand, sliver, or, tow, the, cotton, comes, off, of, the, picking, machine, in, laps, and, is, then, taken, to, carding, machines, the, carders, line, up, the, fibres, neatly, to, make, them, easier, to, spin, the, carding, machine, consists, mainly, of, one, big, roller, with, smaller, ones, surrounding, it, all, of, the, rollers, are, covered, in, small, teeth, and, as, the, cotton, is, moved, forwards, the, teeth, get, finer, i, e, closer, together, the, cotton, leaves, the, carding, machine, in, the, form, of, a, sliver, a, large, rope, of, fibres, in, a, wider, sense, carding, can, refer, to, these, four, processes, combing, is, optional, but, is, used, to, remove, the, shorter, fibres, creating, a, stronger, yarn, several, slivers, are, combined, each, sliver, will, have, thin, and, thick, spots, and, by, combining, several, slivers, together, a, more, consistent, size, can, be, reached, since, combining, several, slivers, produces, a, very, thick, rope, of, cotton, fibres, the, slivers, are, separated, into, rovings, generally, speaking, for, machine, processing, a, roving, is, about, the, width, of, a, pencil, these, rovings, or, slubbings, are, then, what, are, used, in, the, spinning, process, most, spinning, today, is, done, using, break, or, open, end, spinning, this, is, a, technique, where, the, fibres, are, blown, by, air, into, a, rotating, drum, where, they, attach, themselves, to, the, tail, of, formed, yarn, that, is, continually, being, drawn, out, of, the, chamber, other, methods, of, break, spinning, use, needles, and, electrostatic, forces, this, method, has, replaced, the, older, methods, of, ring, and, mule, spinning, it, is, also, easily, adapted, for, artificial, fibres, the, spinning, machines, takes, the, roving, thins, it, and, twists, it, creating, yarn, which, it, winds, onto, a, bobbin, in, mule, spinning, the, roving, is, pulled, off, a, bobbin, and, fed, through, rollers, which, are, feeding, at, several, different, speeds, this, thins, the, roving, at, a, consistent, rate, if, the, roving, was, not, a, consistent, size, then, this, step, could, cause, a, break, in, the, yarn, or, jam, the, machine, the, yarn, is, twisted, through, the, spinning, of, the, bobbin, as, the, carriage, moves, out, and, is, rolled, onto, a, cylinder, called, a, spindle, which, then, produces, a, cone, shaped, bundle, of, fibres, known, as, a, cop, as, the, carriage, returns, mule, spinning, produces, a, finer, thread, than, ring, spinning, the, mule, was, an, intermittent, process, as, the, frame, advanced, and, returned, a, distance, of, five, feet, it, was, the, descendant, of, the, 1779, crompton, device, it, produces, a, softer, less, twisted, thread, that, was, favoured, for, fine, fabrics, and, wefts, the, ring, was, a, descendant, of, the, arkwright, water, frame, of, 1769, it, was, a, continuous, process, the, yarn, was, coarser, had, a, greater, twist, and, was, stronger, thus, suitable, for, use, as, warp, thread, ring, spinning, is, slow, due, to, the, distance, the, thread, must, pass, around, the, ring, sewing, thread, was, made, of, several, threads, twisted, together, or, doubled, this, is, the, process, where, each, of, the, bobbins, is, rewound, to, give, a, tighter, bobbin, plying, is, done, by, pulling, yarn, from, two, or, more, bobbins, and, twisting, it, together, in, a, direction, opposite, to, the, one, it, was, spun, in, depending, on, the, weight, desired, the, cotton, may, or, may, not, be, plied, and, the, number, of, strands, twisted, together, varies, gassing, is, the, process, of, passing, yarn, very, rapidly, through, a, series, of, bunsen, gas, flames, in, a, gassing, frame, to, burn, off, the, projecting, fibres, and, to, make, the, thread, round, and, smooth, and, bright, only, the, better, qualities, of, yarn, are, gassed, like, the, kinds, used, for, voiles, poplins, venetians, gabardines, egyptian, cottons, etc, the, thread, loses, around, 5, 8, of, its, weight, if, it, s, gassed, the, gassed, yarn, is, darker, in, shade, afterwards, but, should, not, be, scorched, the, weaving, process, uses, a, loom, the, lengthwise, threads, are, known, as, the, warp, and, the, crosswise, threads, are, known, as, the, weft, the, warp, which, must, be, strong, needs, to, be, presented, to, loom, on, a, warp, beam, the, weft, passes, across, the, loom, in, a, shuttle, that, carries, the, yarn, on, a, pirn, these, pirns, are, automatically, changed, by, the, loom, thus, the, yarn, needs, to, be, wrapped, onto, a, beam, and, onto, pirns, before, weaving, can, commence, after, being, spun, and, plied, the, cotton, thread, is, taken, to, a, warping, room, where, the, winding, machine, takes, the, required, length, of, yarn, and, winds, it, onto, warpers, bobbins, racks, of, bobbins, are, set, up, to, hold, the, thread, while, it, is, wound, onto, the, warp, beam, of, a, loom, because, the, thread, is, fine, often, three, of, these, would, be, combined, to, get, the, desired, number, of, ends, a, sizing, machine, is, needed, for, strengthening, the, warp, by, adding, starch, to, reduce, breakage, the, process, of, drawing, each, end, of, the, warp, separately, through, the, dents, of, the, reed, and, the, eyes, of, the, healds, in, the, order, indicated, by, the, draft, a, pirn, winding, frame, was, used, to, transfer, the, weft, from, cheeses, of, yarn, onto, the, pirns, that, would, fit, into, the, shuttle, at, this, point, the, thread, is, woven, depending, on, the, era, one, person, could, manage, anywhere, from, 3, to, 100, machines, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, four, was, the, standard, number, a, skilled, weaver, in, 1925, could, run, 6, lancashire, looms, as, time, progressed, new, mechanisms, were, added, that, stopped, the, loom, any, time, something, went, wrong, the, mechanisms, checked, for, such, things, as, broken, warp, or, weft, threads, the, shuttle, going, straight, across, and, if, the, shuttle, was, empty, forty, of, these, northrop, looms, or, automatic, looms, could, be, operated, by, one, skilled, worker, the, three, primary, movements, of, a, loom, are, shedding, picking, and, beating, up, the, lancashire, loom, was, the, first, semi, automatic, loom, jacquard, looms, and, dobby, looms, are, looms, that, have, sophisticated, methods, of, shedding, they, may, be, separate, looms, or, mechanisms, added, to, a, plain, loom, a, northrop, loom, was, fully, automatic, and, was, mass, produced, between, 1909, and, the, mid, 1960s, modern, looms, run, faster, and, do, not, use, a, shuttle, there, are, air, jet, looms, water, jet, looms, and, rapier, looms, ends, and, picks, picks, refer, to, the, weft, ends, refer, to, the, warp, the, coarseness, of, the, cloth, can, be, expressed, as, the, number, of, picks, and, ends, per, quarter, inch, square, or, per, inch, square, ends, is, always, written, first, for, example, heavy, domestics, are, made, from, coarse, yarns, such, as, 10, s, to, 14, s, warp, and, weft, and, about, 48, ends, and, 52, picks, associated, job, titles, include, piecer, scavenger, weaver, tackler, draw, boy, when, a, hand, loom, was, located, in, the, home, children, helped, with, the, weaving, process, from, an, early, age, piecing, needs, dexterity, and, a, child, can, be, as, productive, as, an, adult, when, weaving, moved, from, the, home, to, the, mill, children, were, often, allowed, to, help, their, older, sisters, and, laws, had, to, be, made, to, prevent, child, labour, from, becoming, established, the, working, conditions, of, cotton, production, were, often, harsh, with, long, hours, low, pay, and, dangerous, machinery, children, above, all, were, also, prone, to, physical, abuse, and, often, forced, to, work, in, unsanitary, conditions, it, should, also, be, noted, that, children, who, worked, in, handlooms, often, faced, extreme, poverty, and, were, unable, to, obtain, an, education, the, working, conditions, of, cotton, production, were, often, harsh, with, long, hours, low, pay, and, dangerous, machinery, children, above, all, were, also, prone, to, physical, abuse, and, often, forced, to, work, in, unsanitary, conditions, it, should, also, be, noted, that, children, who, worked, in, handlooms, often, faced, extreme, poverty, and, were, unable, to, obtain, an, education, knitting, by, machine, is, done, in, two, different, ways, warp, and, weft, weft, knitting, as, seen, in, the, pictures, is, similar, in, method, to, hand, knitting, with, stitches, all, connected, to, each, other, horizontally, various, weft, machines, can, be, configured, to, produce, textiles, from, a, single, spool, of, yarn, or, multiple, spools, depending, on, the, size, of, the, machine, cylinder, in, which, the, needles, are, bedded, in, a, warp, knit, there, are, many, pieces, of, yarn, and, there, are, vertical, chains, zigzagged, together, by, crossing, the, cotton, yarn, warp, knits, do, not, stretch, as, much, as, a, weft, knits, and, they, are, run, resistant, a, weft, knit, is, not, run, resistant, but, it, has, more, stretch, this, is, especially, true, if, spools, of, elastane, are, processed, from, separate, spool, containers, and, interwoven, through, the, cylinder, with, cotton, yarn, giving, the, finished, product, more, flexibility, and, preventing, it, from, having, a, baggy, appearance, the, average, t, shirt, is, a, weft, knit, finishing, is, a, broad, range, of, physical, and, chemical, processes, treatments, that, complete, one, stage, of, textile, manufacturing, sometimes, in, preparation, for, the, next, step, finishing, adds, value, to, the, product, and, makes, it, more, attractive, useful, and, functional, for, the, end, user, fresh, off, the, loom, cotton, fabric, not, only, contains, impurities, including, warp, size, but, it, also, requires, further, treatment, to, develop, its, full, potential, and, to, add, to, its, value, depending, on, the, size, that, has, been, used, the, cloth, may, be, steeped, in, a, dilute, acid, and, then, rinsed, or, enzymes, may, be, used, to, break, down, the, size, scouring, is, a, chemical, washing, process, carried, out, on, cotton, fabric, to, remove, natural, waxes, and, non, fibrous, impurities, like, the, remains, of, seed, fragments, from, the, fibres, and, any, soiling, or, dirt, that, might, remain, scouring, is, usually, carried, out, in, iron, vessels, called, kiers, the, fabric, is, boiled, in, an, alkali, solution, which, forms, a, soap, with, free, fatty, acids, a, kier, is, usually, enclosed, so, the, solution, of, sodium, hydroxide, can, be, boiled, under, pressure, excluding, oxygen, which, would, degrade, the, cellulose, in, the, fibre, if, the, appropriate, reagents, are, used, scouring, will, also, remove, size, from, the, fabric, although, desizing, often, precedes, scouring, and, is, considered, to, be, a, separate, process, preparation, and, scouring, are, prerequisites, to, most, of, the, other, finishing, processes, at, this, stage, even, the, most, naturally, white, cotton, fibres, are, yellowish, and, bleaching, is, required, bleaching, improves, whiteness, by, removing, natural, colouration, and, whatever, impurities, remain, in, the, cotton, the, degree, of, bleaching, is, determined, by, the, levels, of, whiteness, and, absorbency, required, of, the, fabric, cotton, being, a, vegetable, fibre, is, bleached, using, an, oxidizing, agent, such, as, diluted, sodium, hypochlorite, or, diluted, hydrogen, peroxide, if, the, fabric, is, to, be, dyed, a, deep, shade, then, lower, levels, of, bleaching, are, acceptable, however, for, white, bedding, and, for, medical, applications, the, highest, levels, of, whiteness, and, absorbency, are, essential, a, further, possibility, is, mercerising, during, which, the, fabric, is, treated, with, a, caustic, soda, solution, to, cause, swelling, of, the, fibres, this, results, in, improved, lustre, strength, and, dye, affinity, cotton, is, mercerised, under, tension, and, all, alkali, must, be, washed, out, before, the, tension, is, released, or, shrinkage, will, take, place, many, other, chemical, treatments, may, be, applied, to, cotton, fabrics, to, produce, low, flammability, crease, resistance, and, other, qualities, but, the, four, most, important, non, chemical, finishing, treatments, are, singeing, is, designed, to, burn, off, the, surface, fibres, from, the, fabric, to, produce, smoothness, the, fabric, passes, over, brushes, to, raise, the, fibres, then, passes, over, a, plate, heated, by, gas, flames, during, raising, the, fabric, surface, is, treated, with, sharp, teeth, to, lift, the, surface, fibres, thereby, imparting, downiness, softness, and, warmth, as, in, flannelette, calendering, is, a, process, in, which, the, fabric, is, passed, between, heated, rollers, to, generate, smooth, polished, or, embossed, effects, sanforisation, is, a, form, of, mechanical, pre, shrinking, so, that, the, fabric, will, shrink, less, upon, laundering, dyeing, is, commonly, carried, out, with, an, anionic, direct, dye, by, completely, immersing, the, fabric, or, yarn, in, an, aqueous, dye, bath, according, to, a, prescribed, procedure, for, improved, fastness, to, washing, rubbing, and, light, further, dyeing, methods, can, be, used, these, require, more, complex, chemistry, during, processing, and, are, thus, more, expensive, to, apply, printing, is, the, application, of, colour, in, the, form, of, a, paste, or, ink, to, the, surface, of, a, fabric, in, a, predetermined, pattern, it, can, be, described, as, a, form, of, localised, dyeing, printing, designs, onto, previously, dyed, fabric, is, also, possible, production, of, cotton, requires, arable, land, in, addition, cotton, is, farmed, intensively, and, uses, large, amounts, of, fertilizer, and, 25, of, the, world, s, insecticides, native, indian, varieties, of, cotton, were, rainwater, fed, but, modern, hybrids, used, for, the, mills, need, irrigation, which, spreads, pests, the, 5, of, cotton, bearing, land, in, india, uses, 55, of, all, pesticides, used, in, india, the, consumption, of, energy, in, form, of, water, and, electricity, is, relatively, high, especially, in, processes, like, washing, de, sizing, bleaching, rinsing, dyeing, printing, coating, and, finishing, processing, is, time, consuming, the, major, portion, of, water, in, textile, industry, is, used, for, wet, processing, of, textile, 70, per, cent, approximately, 25, per, cent, of, energy, in, the, total, textile, production, like, fibre, production, spinning, twisting, weaving, knitting, clothing, manufacturing, etc, is, used, in, dyeing, about, 34, per, cent, of, energy, is, consumed, in, spinning, 23, per, cent, in, weaving, 38, per, cent, in, chemical, wet, processing, and, five, per, cent, in, miscellaneous, processes, power, dominates, consumption, pattern, in, spinning, and, weaving, while, thermal, energy, is, the, major, factor, for, chemical, wet, processing, cotton, acts, as, a, carbon, sink, as, it, contains, cellulose, and, this, contains, 44, 44, carbon, however, due, to, carbon, emissions, from, fertiliser, application, use, of, mechanized, tools, to, harvest, the, cotton, and, so, forth, cotton, manufacture, tends, to, emit, more, co, 2, than, is, stored, in, the, form, of, cellulose, the, growth, of, cotton, is, divided, into, two, segments, i, e, organic, and, genetically, modified, cotton, crop, provides, livelihood, to, millions, of, people, but, its, production, is, becoming, expensive, because, of, high, water, consumption, use, of, expensive, pesticides, insecticides, and, fertiliser, genetically, modified, products, aim, to, increase, disease, resistance, and, reduce, the, water, required, the, organic, sector, in, india, was, worth, 583, million, genetically, modified, cotton, in, 2007, occupied, 43, of, cotton, growing, areas, in, india, before, mechanisation, cotton, was, harvested, manually, by, farmers, in, india, and, by, african, slaves, in, america, in, 2012, uzbekistan, was, a, major, exporter, of, cotton, and, uses, manual, labour, during, the, harvest, human, rights, groups, have, expressed, concerns, over, healthcare, professionals, and, children, being, forced, to, pick, cotton, there, was, a, 1, 5, million, tonne, cotton, deficit, in, 2018, due, to, adverse, weather, conditions, limited, water, and, pest, issues, flax, is, a, bast, fibre, which, means, it, comes, in, bundles, under, the, bark, of, the, linum, usitatissimum, plant, the, plant, flowers, and, is, harvested, it, is, subjected, to, retting, breaking, scutching, hackling, or, combing, it, is, then, treated, like, cotton, jute, is, a, bast, fibre, which, comes, from, the, inner, bark, of, the, plants, of, the, corchorus, genus, it, is, retted, like, flax, sundried, and, baled, when, spinning, a, small, amount, of, oil, must, be, added, to, the, fibre, it, can, be, bleached, and, dyed, it, was, used, for, sacks, and, bags, but, is, now, used, for, the, backing, for, carpets, jute, can, be, blended, with, other, fibres, to, make, composite, fabrics, and, work, continues, in, bangladesh, to, refine, the, processes, and, extend, the, range, of, usage, possible, in, the, 1970s, jute, cotton, composite, fabrics, were, known, as, jutton, fabrics, hemp, is, a, bast, fibre, from, the, inner, bark, of, cannabis, sativa, it, is, difficult, to, bleach, and, is, used, for, making, cord, and, rope, it, is, subject, to, retting, separating, and, pounding, these, bast, fibres, can, also, be, used, kenaf, urena, ramie, nettle, sisal, is, the, main, leaf, fibre, used, others, are, abac, and, henequen, wool, comes, from, domesticated, sheep, it, is, used, to, create, two, kinds, of, yarn, woolens, and, worsteds, these, are, distinguished, by, the, direction, of, the, wool, fibres, in, relation, to, the, thread, woolens, are, perpendicularly, arranged, allowing, for, fluffy, yarns, that, trap, air, while, worsteds, have, parallel, fibres, creating, a, strong, and, smooth, yarn, modern, sheep, have, uniform, fleeces, while, primitive, and, landrace, sheep, often, have, dual, coats, a, soft, short, under, layer, and, a, hardier, coarser, and, longer, guard, layer, these, can, be, sorted, to, be, processed, separately, or, spun, together, the, differing, characteristics, of, each, coat, allows, for, very, different, yarn, the, guard, hairs, can, be, used, for, durable, outerwear, while, the, inner, coat, is, what, is, traditionally, used, to, produce, the, ultrafine, wedding, ring, shawls, across, europe, spinning, them, together, like, in, lopi, produces, a, unique, yarn, that, combines, the, strength, of, the, guard, hairs, with, the, loft, and, softness, of, the, undercoat, wool, that, has, never, been, used, is, known, as, virgin, wool, and, can, be, mixed, with, wool, that, has, been, recovered, from, rags, shoddy, is, the, term, for,

grading, is, done, on, quality, as, well, as, length, of, the, fibres, long, wool, fibres, can, be, up, to, 15, in, but, anything, over, 2, 5, inches, is, suitable, for, combing, into, worsteds, fibres, less, than, that, form, short, wool, and, are, described, as, clothing, or, carding, wool, and, are, best, suited, for, the, jumbled, arrangement, of, woolens, at, the, mill, the, wool, is, scoured, in, a, detergent, to, remove, grease, the, yolk, and, impurities, this, is, done, mechanically, in, the, opening, machine, vegetable, matter, can, be, removed, chemically, using, sulphuric, acid, carbonising, washing, uses, a, solution, of, soap, and, sodium, carbonate, the, wool, is, oiled, before, carding, or, combing, the, processes, in, silk, production, are, similar, to, those, of, cotton, but, take, account, that, reeled, silk, is, a, continuous, fibre, the, terms, used, are, different, both, wool, and, silk, require, farmland, whereas, silkworms, require, mulberry, leaves, sheep, eat, grass, clover, forbs, and, other, pasture, plants, sheep, like, all, ruminants, emit, co, 2, via, their, digestive, system, also, their, pastures, may, sometimes, be, fertilised, which, further, increases, emissions, synthetic, fibres, are, the, result, of, extensive, development, by, scientists, to, improve, upon, the, naturally, occurring, animal, and, plant, fibres, in, general, synthetic, fibres, are, created, by, forcing, or, extruding, fibre, forming, materials, through, holes, called, spinnerets, into, the, air, thus, forming, a, thread, before, synthetic, fibres, were, developed, cellulose, fibres, were, made, from, natural, cellulose, which, comes, from, plants, the, first, artificial, fibre, known, as, art, silk, from, 1799, onwards, became, known, as, viscose, around, 1894, and, finally, rayon, in, 1924, a, similar, product, known, as, cellulose, acetate, was, discovered, in, 1865, rayon, and, acetate, are, both, artificial, fibres, but, not, truly, synthetic, being, made, from, wood, although, these, artificial, fibres, were, discovered, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, successful, modern, manufacture, began, much, later, in, the, 1930s, nylon, the, first, synthetic, fibre, made, its, debut, in, the, united, states, as, a, replacement, for, silk, and, was, used, for, parachutes, and, other, military, uses, the, techniques, used, to, process, these, fibres, in, yarn, are, essentially, the, same, as, with, natural, fibres, modifications, have, to, be, made, as, these, fibres, are, of, great, length, and, have, no, texture, such, as, the, scales, in, cotton, and, wool, that, aid, meshing, unlike, natural, fibres, produced, by, plants, animals, or, insects, synthetic, fibres, are, made, from, fossil, fuels, and, thus, require,
