the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, are, diverse, groups, native, to, a, specific, region, who, inhabited, the, americas, in, the, pre, columbian, era, before, the, arrival, of, european, settlers, in, the, 15th, century, as, well, as, the, ethnic, groups, who, continue, to, identify, with, those, peoples, these, populations, exhibit, significant, diversity, some, indigenous, peoples, were, historically, hunter, gatherers, while, others, practiced, agriculture, and, aquaculture, various, indigenous, societies, developed, complex, social, structures, including, pre, contact, monumental, architecture, organized, cities, city, states, chiefdoms, states, kingdoms, republics, confederacies, and, empires, these, societies, possessed, varying, levels, of, knowledge, in, fields, such, as, engineering, architecture, mathematics, astronomy, writing, physics, medicine, agriculture, irrigation, geology, mining, metallurgy, sculpture, and, goldsmithing, indigenous, peoples, continue, to, inhabit, many, regions, of, the, americas, with, significant, populations, in, countries, such, as, bolivia, canada, chile, colombia, ecuador, guatemala, mexico, peru, and, the, united, states, there, are, at, least, a, thousand, different, indigenous, languages, spoken, across, the, americas, with, 574, federally, recognized, tribes, in, the, us, alone, some, languages, including, quechua, arawak, aymara, guaran, mayan, and, nahuatl, have, millions, of, speakers, and, are, recognized, as, official, by, governments, in, bolivia, peru, paraguay, and, greenland, indigenous, peoples, whether, residing, in, rural, or, urban, areas, often, maintain, aspects, of, their, cultural, practices, including, religion, social, organization, and, subsistence, practices, over, time, these, cultures, have, evolved, preserving, traditional, customs, while, adapting, to, modern, needs, some, indigenous, groups, remain, relatively, isolated, from, western, culture, with, a, few, still, considered, uncontacted, peoples, the, americas, also, host, millions, of, individuals, of, mixed, indigenous, european, and, sometimes, african, or, asian, descent, historically, referred, to, as, mestizos, in, spanish, speaking, countries, in, many, latin, american, nations, people, of, partial, indigenous, descent, constitute, a, majority, or, significant, portion, of, the, population, particularly, in, central, america, mexico, peru, bolivia, ecuador, colombia, venezuela, chile, and, paraguay, mestizos, outnumber, indigenous, peoples, in, most, spanish, speaking, countries, according, to, estimates, of, ethnic, cultural, identification, however, since, indigenous, communities, in, the, americas, are, defined, by, cultural, identification, and, kinship, rather, than, ancestry, or, race, mestizos, are, typically, not, counted, among, the, indigenous, population, unless, they, speak, an, indigenous, language, or, identify, with, a, specific, indigenous, culture, additionally, many, individuals, of, wholly, indigenous, descent, who, do, not, follow, indigenous, traditions, or, speak, an, indigenous, language, have, been, classified, or, self, identify, as, mestizo, due, to, assimilation, into, the, dominant, hispanic, culture, in, recent, years, the, self, identified, indigenous, population, in, many, countries, has, increased, as, individuals, reclaim, their, heritage, amid, rising, indigenous, led, movements, for, self, determination, and, social, justice, application, of, the, term, indian, originated, with, christopher, columbus, who, in, his, search, for, india, thought, that, he, had, arrived, in, the, east, indies, the, islands, came, to, be, known, as, the, west, indies, or, antilles, a, name, that, is, still, used, to, describe, the, islands, this, led, to, the, blanket, term, indies, and, indians, spanish, indios, portuguese, ndios, french, indiens, dutch, indianen, for, the, indigenous, inhabitants, which, implied, some, kind, of, ethnic, or, cultural, unity, among, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, this, unifying, concept, codified, in, law, religion, and, politics, was, not, originally, accepted, by, the, myriad, groups, of, indigenous, peoples, themselves, but, has, since, been, embraced, or, tolerated, by, many, over, the, last, two, centuries, the, term, indian, generally, does, not, include, the, culturally, and, linguistically, distinct, indigenous, peoples, of, the, arctic, regions, of, the, americas, including, the, aleuts, inuit, or, yupik, peoples, these, peoples, entered, the, continent, as, a, second, more, recent, wave, of, migration, several, thousand, years, later, and, have, much, more, recent, genetic, and, cultural, commonalities, with, the, indigenous, peoples, of, siberia, however, these, groups, are, nonetheless, considered, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, the, term, amerindian, a, portmanteau, of, american, indian, was, coined, in, 1902, by, the, american, anthropological, association, it, has, been, controversial, ever, since, its, creation, it, was, immediately, rejected, by, some, leading, members, of, the, association, and, while, adopted, by, many, it, was, never, universally, accepted, while, never, popular, in, indigenous, communities, themselves, it, remains, a, preferred, term, among, some, anthropologists, notably, in, some, parts, of, canada, and, the, english, speaking, caribbean, indigenous, peoples, in, canada, is, used, as, the, collective, name, for, first, nations, inuit, and, m, tis, the, term, aboriginal, peoples, as, a, collective, noun, also, describing, first, nations, inuit, and, m, tis, is, a, specific, term, of, art, used, in, some, legal, documents, including, the, constitution, act, 1982, over, time, as, societal, perceptions, and, government, indigenous, relationships, have, shifted, many, historical, terms, have, changed, definitions, or, been, replaced, as, they, have, fallen, out, of, favor, the, use, of, the, term, indian, is, frowned, upon, because, it, represents, the, imposition, and, restriction, of, indigenous, peoples, and, cultures, by, the, canadian, government, the, terms, native, and, eskimo, are, generally, regarded, as, disrespectful, in, canada, and, so, are, rarely, used, unless, specifically, required, while, indigenous, peoples, is, the, preferred, term, many, individuals, or, communities, may, choose, to, describe, their, identity, using, a, different, term, the, m, tis, people, of, canada, can, be, contrasted, for, instance, to, the, indigenous, european, mixed, race, mestizos, or, caboclos, in, brazil, of, hispanic, america, who, with, their, larger, population, in, most, latin, american, countries, constituting, either, outright, majorities, pluralities, or, at, the, least, large, minorities, identify, largely, as, a, new, ethnic, group, distinct, from, both, europeans, and, indigenous, but, still, considering, themselves, a, subset, of, the, european, derived, hispanic, or, brazilian, peoplehood, in, culture, and, ethnicity, cf, ladinos, among, spanish, speaking, countries, ind, genas, or, pueblos, ind, genas, indigenous, peoples, is, a, common, term, though, nativos, or, pueblos, nativos, native, peoples, may, also, be, heard, moreover, aborigen, aborigine, is, used, in, argentina, and, pueblos, originarios, original, peoples, is, common, in, chile, in, brazil, ind, genas, and, povos, origin, rios, indigenous, peoples, are, common, formal, sounding, designations, while, ndio, indian, is, still, the, more, often, heard, term, the, noun, for, the, south, asian, nationality, being, indiano, but, for, the, past, 10, years, has, been, considered, offensive, and, pejorative, abor, gene, and, nativo, are, rarely, used, in, brazil, in, indigenous, specific, contexts, e, g, abor, gene, is, usually, understood, as, the, ethnonym, for, indigenous, australians, the, spanish, and, portuguese, equivalents, to, indian, nevertheless, could, be, used, to, mean, any, hunter, gatherer, or, full, blooded, indigenous, person, particularly, to, continents, other, than, europe, or, africa, for, example, indios, filipinos, indigenous, peoples, of, the, united, states, are, commonly, known, as, native, americans, indians, as, well, as, alaska, natives, the, term, indian, is, still, used, in, some, communities, and, remains, in, use, in, the, official, names, of, many, institutions, and, businesses, in, indian, country, the, various, nations, tribes, and, bands, of, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, have, differing, preferences, in, terminology, for, themselves, while, there, are, regional, and, generational, variations, in, which, umbrella, terms, are, preferred, for, indigenous, peoples, as, a, whole, in, general, most, indigenous, peoples, prefer, to, be, identified, by, the, name, of, their, specific, nation, tribe, or, band, early, settlers, often, adopted, terms, that, some, tribes, used, for, each, other, not, realizing, these, were, derogatory, terms, used, by, enemies, when, discussing, broader, subsets, of, peoples, naming, has, often, been, based, on, shared, language, region, or, historical, relationship, many, english, exonyms, have, been, used, to, refer, to, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, some, of, these, names, were, based, on, foreign, language, terms, used, by, earlier, explorers, and, colonists, while, others, resulted, from, the, colonists, attempts, to, translate, or, transliterate, endonyms, from, the, native, languages, other, terms, arose, during, periods, of, conflict, between, the, colonists, and, indigenous, peoples, since, the, late, 20th, century, indigenous, peoples, in, the, americas, have, been, more, vocal, about, how, they, want, to, be, addressed, pushing, to, suppress, the, use, of, terms, widely, considered, to, be, obsolete, inaccurate, or, racist, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, rise, of, the, indian, rights, movement, the, united, states, federal, government, responded, by, proposing, the, use, of, the, term, native, american, to, recognize, the, primacy, of, indigenous, peoples, tenure, in, the, nation, as, may, be, expected, among, people, of, over, 400, different, cultures, in, the, us, alone, not, all, of, the, people, intended, to, be, described, by, this, term, have, agreed, on, its, use, or, adopted, it, no, single, group, naming, convention, has, been, accepted, by, all, indigenous, peoples, in, the, americas, most, prefer, to, be, addressed, as, people, of, their, tribe, or, nations, when, not, speaking, about, native, americans, american, indians, as, a, whole, since, the, 1970s, the, word, indigenous, which, is, capitalized, when, referring, to, people, has, gradually, emerged, as, a, favored, umbrella, term, the, capitalization, is, to, acknowledge, that, indigenous, peoples, have, cultures, and, societies, that, are, equal, to, europeans, africans, and, asians, this, has, recently, been, acknowledged, in, the, ap, stylebook, some, consider, it, improper, to, refer, to, indigenous, people, as, indigenous, americans, or, to, append, any, colonial, nationality, to, the, term, because, indigenous, cultures, existed, before, european, colonization, indigenous, groups, have, territorial, claims, that, are, different, from, modern, national, and, international, borders, and, when, labeled, as, part, of, a, country, their, traditional, lands, are, not, acknowledged, some, who, have, written, guidelines, consider, it, more, appropriate, to, describe, an, indigenous, person, as, living, in, or, of, the, americas, rather, than, calling, them, american, or, simply, calling, them, indigenous, without, any, addition, of, a, colonial, state, the, peopling, of, the, americas, began, when, paleolithic, hunter, gatherers, paleo, indians, entered, north, america, from, the, north, asian, mammoth, steppe, via, the, beringia, land, bridge, which, had, formed, between, northeastern, siberia, and, western, alaska, due, to, the, lowering, of, sea, level, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, 26, 000, to, 19, 000, years, ago, these, populations, expanded, south, of, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, and, spread, rapidly, southward, occupying, both, north, and, south, america, by, 12, 000, to, 14, 000, years, ago, the, earliest, populations, in, the, americas, before, roughly, 10, 000, years, ago, are, known, as, paleo, indians, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, have, been, linked, to, siberian, populations, by, proposed, linguistic, factors, the, distribution, of, blood, types, and, in, genetic, composition, as, reflected, by, molecular, data, such, as, dna, while, there, is, general, agreement, that, the, americas, were, first, settled, from, asia, the, pattern, of, migration, and, the, place, s, of, origin, in, eurasia, of, the, peoples, who, migrated, to, the, americas, remain, unclear, the, traditional, theory, is, that, ancient, beringians, moved, when, sea, levels, were, significantly, lowered, due, to, the, quaternary, glaciation, following, herds, of, now, extinct, pleistocene, megafauna, along, ice, free, corridors, that, stretched, between, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, another, route, proposed, is, that, either, on, foot, or, using, boats, they, migrated, down, the, pacific, coast, to, south, america, as, far, as, chile, any, archaeological, evidence, of, coastal, occupation, during, the, last, ice, age, would, now, have, been, covered, by, the, sea, level, rise, up, to, a, hundred, metres, since, then, while, technically, referring, to, the, era, before, christopher, columbus, voyages, of, 1492, to, 1504, in, practice, the, term, usually, includes, the, history, of, indigenous, cultures, until, europeans, either, conquered, or, significantly, influenced, them, pre, columbian, is, used, especially, often, in, the, context, of, discussing, the, pre, contact, mesoamerican, indigenous, societies, olmec, toltec, teotihuacano, zapotec, mixtec, aztec, and, maya, civilizations, and, the, complex, cultures, of, the, andes, inca, empire, moche, culture, muisca, confederation, and, ca, ari, the, pre, columbian, era, refers, to, all, period, subdivisions, in, the, history, and, prehistory, of, the, americas, before, the, appearance, of, significant, european, and, african, influences, on, the, american, continents, spanning, the, time, of, the, original, arrival, in, the, upper, paleolithic, to, european, colonization, during, the, early, modern, period, the, norte, chico, civilization, in, present, day, peru, is, one, of, the, defining, six, original, civilizations, of, the, world, arising, independently, around, the, same, time, as, that, of, egypt, many, later, pre, columbian, civilizations, achieved, great, complexity, with, hallmarks, that, included, permanent, or, urban, settlements, agriculture, engineering, astronomy, trade, civic, and, monumental, architecture, and, complex, societal, hierarchies, some, of, these, civilizations, had, long, faded, by, the, time, of, the, first, significant, european, and, african, arrivals, ca, late, 15th, early, 16th, centuries, and, are, known, only, through, oral, history, and, through, archaeological, investigations, others, were, contemporary, with, the, contact, and, colonization, period, and, were, documented, in, historical, accounts, of, the, time, a, few, such, as, the, mayan, olmec, mixtec, aztec, and, nahua, peoples, had, their, written, languages, and, records, however, the, european, colonists, of, the, time, worked, to, eliminate, non, christian, beliefs, and, burned, many, pre, columbian, written, records, only, a, few, documents, remained, hidden, and, survived, leaving, contemporary, historians, with, glimpses, of, ancient, culture, and, knowledge, according, to, both, indigenous, and, european, accounts, and, documents, american, civilizations, before, and, at, the, time, of, european, encounter, had, achieved, great, complexity, and, many, accomplishments, for, instance, the, aztecs, built, one, of, the, largest, cities, in, the, world, tenochtitlan, the, historical, site, of, what, would, become, mexico, city, with, an, estimated, population, of, 200, 000, for, the, city, proper, and, a, population, of, close, to, five, million, for, the, extended, empire, by, comparison, the, largest, european, cities, in, the, 16th, century, were, constantinople, and, paris, with, 300, 000, and, 200, 000, inhabitants, respectively, the, population, in, london, madrid, and, rome, hardly, exceeded, 50, 000, people, in, 1523, right, around, the, time, of, the, spanish, conquest, the, entire, population, in, the, country, of, england, was, just, under, three, million, people, this, fact, speaks, to, the, level, of, sophistication, agriculture, governmental, procedure, and, rule, of, law, that, existed, in, tenochtitlan, needed, to, govern, over, such, a, large, citizenry, indigenous, civilizations, also, displayed, impressive, accomplishments, in, astronomy, and, mathematics, including, the, most, accurate, calendar, in, the, world, the, domestication, of, maize, or, corn, required, thousands, of, years, of, selective, breeding, and, continued, cultivation, of, multiple, varieties, was, done, with, planning, and, selection, generally, by, women, inuit, yupik, aleut, and, indigenous, creation, myths, tell, of, a, variety, of, origins, of, their, respective, peoples, some, were, always, there, or, were, created, by, gods, or, animals, some, migrated, from, a, specified, compass, point, and, others, came, from, across, the, ocean, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, fundamentally, changed, the, lives, and, cultures, of, the, resident, indigenous, peoples, although, the, exact, pre, colonization, population, count, of, the, americas, is, unknown, scholars, estimate, that, indigenous, populations, diminished, by, between, 80, and, 90, during, the, first, centuries, of, european, colonization, most, scholars, estimate, a, pre, colonization, population, of, around, 50, million, with, other, scholars, arguing, for, an, estimate, of, 100, million, estimates, reach, as, high, as, 145, million, epidemics, ravaged, the, americas, with, diseases, such, as, smallpox, measles, and, cholera, which, the, early, colonists, brought, from, europe, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, was, slow, initially, as, most, europeans, were, not, actively, or, visibly, infected, due, to, inherited, immunity, from, generations, of, exposure, to, these, diseases, in, europe, this, changed, when, the, europeans, began, the, human, trafficking, of, massive, numbers, of, enslaved, western, and, central, african, people, to, the, americas, like, indigenous, peoples, these, african, people, newly, exposed, to, european, diseases, lacked, any, inherited, resistance, to, the, diseases, of, europe, in, 1520, an, african, who, had, been, infected, with, smallpox, had, arrived, in, yucat, n, by, 1558, the, disease, had, spread, throughout, south, america, and, had, arrived, at, the, plata, basin, colonist, violence, towards, indigenous, peoples, accelerated, the, loss, of, lives, european, colonists, perpetrated, massacres, on, the, indigenous, peoples, and, enslaved, them, according, to, the, u, s, bureau, of, the, census, 1894, the, north, american, indian, wars, of, the, 19th, century, had, a, known, death, toll, of, about, 19, 000, europeans, and, 30, 000, native, americans, and, an, estimated, total, death, toll, of, 45, 000, native, americans, the, first, indigenous, group, encountered, by, columbus, the, 250, 000, ta, nos, of, hispaniola, represented, the, dominant, culture, in, the, greater, antilles, and, the, bahamas, within, thirty, years, about, 70, of, the, ta, nos, had, died, they, had, no, immunity, to, european, diseases, so, outbreaks, of, measles, and, smallpox, ravaged, their, population, one, such, outbreak, occurred, in, a, camp, of, enslaved, africans, where, smallpox, spread, to, the, nearby, ta, no, population, and, reduced, their, numbers, by, 50, increasing, punishment, of, the, ta, nos, for, revolting, against, forced, labor, despite, measures, put, in, place, by, the, encomienda, which, included, religious, education, and, protection, from, warring, tribes, eventually, led, to, the, last, great, ta, no, rebellion, 1511, 1529, following, years, of, mistreatment, the, ta, nos, began, to, adopt, suicidal, behaviors, with, women, aborting, or, killing, their, infants, and, men, jumping, from, cliffs, or, ingesting, untreated, cassava, a, violent, poison, eventually, a, ta, no, cacique, named, enriquillo, managed, to, hold, out, in, the, baoruco, mountain, range, for, thirteen, years, causing, serious, damage, to, the, spanish, carib, held, plantations, and, their, indian, auxiliaries, hearing, of, the, seriousness, of, the, revolt, emperor, charles, v, also, king, of, spain, sent, captain, francisco, barrionuevo, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, with, the, ever, increasing, number, of, rebels, two, months, later, after, consultation, with, the, audencia, of, santo, domingo, enriquillo, was, offered, any, part, of, the, island, to, live, in, peace, the, laws, of, burgos, 1512, 1513, were, the, first, codified, set, of, laws, governing, the, behavior, of, spanish, settlers, in, america, particularly, concerning, indigenous, peoples, the, laws, forbade, the, maltreatment, of, them, and, endorsed, their, conversion, to, catholicism, the, spanish, crown, found, it, difficult, to, enforce, these, laws, in, distant, colonies, epidemic, disease, was, the, overwhelming, cause, of, the, population, decline, of, the, indigenous, peoples, after, initial, contact, with, europeans, and, africans, old, world, diseases, caused, the, deaths, of, 90, to, 95, of, the, native, population, of, the, new, world, in, the, following, 150, years, smallpox, killed, from, one, third, to, half, of, the, native, population, of, hispaniola, in, 1518, by, killing, the, incan, ruler, huayna, capac, smallpox, caused, the, inca, civil, war, of, 1529, 1532, smallpox, was, only, the, first, epidemic, typhus, probably, in, 1546, influenza, and, smallpox, together, in, 1558, smallpox, again, in, 1589, diphtheria, in, 1614, and, measles, in, 1618, all, ravaged, the, remains, of, inca, culture, smallpox, killed, millions, of, native, inhabitants, of, mexico, unintentionally, introduced, at, veracruz, with, the, arrival, of, p, nfilo, de, narv, ez, on, 23, april, 1520, smallpox, ravaged, mexico, in, the, 1520s, possibly, killing, over, 150, 000, in, tenochtitl, n, the, heartland, of, the, aztec, empire, alone, and, aiding, in, the, victory, of, hern, n, cort, s, over, the, aztec, empire, at, tenochtitlan, present, day, mexico, city, in, 1521, there, are, many, factors, as, to, why, indigenous, peoples, suffered, such, immense, losses, from, afro, eurasian, diseases, many, old, world, diseases, like, cow, pox, are, acquired, from, domesticated, animals, that, are, not, indigenous, to, the, americas, european, populations, had, adapted, to, these, diseases, and, built, up, resistance, over, many, generations, many, of, the, old, world, diseases, that, were, brought, over, to, the, americas, were, diseases, like, yellow, fever, that, were, relatively, manageable, if, infected, as, a, child, but, were, deadly, if, infected, as, an, adult, children, could, often, survive, the, disease, resulting, in, immunity, to, the, disease, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, but, contact, with, adult, populations, without, this, childhood, or, inherited, immunity, would, result, in, these, diseases, proving, fatal, colonization, of, the, caribbean, led, to, the, destruction, of, the, arawaks, of, the, lesser, antilles, their, culture, was, destroyed, by, 1650, only, 500, had, survived, by, the, year, 1550, though, the, bloodlines, continued, through, to, the, modern, populace, in, amazonia, indigenous, societies, weathered, and, continue, to, suffer, centuries, of, colonization, and, genocide, contact, with, european, diseases, such, as, smallpox, and, measles, killed, between, 50, and, 67, percent, of, the, indigenous, population, of, north, america, in, the, first, hundred, years, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, some, 90, percent, of, the, native, population, near, massachusetts, bay, colony, died, of, smallpox, in, an, epidemic, in, 1617, 1619, in, 1633, in, fort, orange, new, netherland, the, native, americans, there, were, exposed, to, smallpox, because, of, contact, with, europeans, as, it, had, done, elsewhere, the, virus, wiped, out, entire, population, groups, of, native, americans, it, reached, lake, ontario, in, 1636, and, the, lands, of, the, iroquois, by, 1679, during, the, 1770s, smallpox, killed, at, least, 30, of, the, west, coast, native, americans, the, 1775, 82, north, american, smallpox, epidemic, and, the, 1837, great, plains, smallpox, epidemic, brought, devastation, and, drastic, population, depletion, among, the, plains, indians, in, 1832, the, federal, government, of, the, united, states, established, a, smallpox, vaccination, program, for, native, americans, the, indian, vaccination, act, of, 1832, the, indigenous, peoples, in, brazil, declined, from, a, pre, columbian, high, of, an, estimated, three, million, to, some, 300, 000, in, 1997, the, spanish, empire, and, other, europeans, re, introduced, horses, to, the, americas, some, of, these, animals, escaped, and, began, to, breed, and, increase, their, numbers, in, the, wild, the, reintroduction, of, the, horse, extinct, in, the, americas, for, over, 7500, years, had, a, profound, impact, on, indigenous, cultures, in, several, regions, such, as, those, of, the, great, plains, the, northwest, plateau, the, great, basin, aridoamerica, the, gran, chaco, and, the, southern, cone, by, domesticating, horses, some, tribes, had, great, success, horses, enabled, them, to, expand, their, territories, exchange, more, goods, with, neighboring, tribes, and, more, easily, capture, game, such, as, bison, according, to, erin, mckenna, and, scott, l, pratt, the, indigenous, population, of, the, americas, was, 145, million, in, the, late, 15th, and, by, the, late, 17th, century, had, been, reduced, to, 15, million, due, to, epidemics, wars, massacres, mass, rapes, starvation, and, enslavement, indigenous, historical, trauma, iht, is, the, trauma, that, can, accumulate, across, generations, and, develop, as, a, result, of, the, historical, ramifications, of, colonization, and, is, linked, to, mental, and, physical, health, hardships, and, population, decline, iht, affects, many, different, people, in, a, multitude, of, ways, because, the, indigenous, community, and, their, history, are, diverse, many, studies, such, as, whitbeck, et, al, 2014, brockie, 2012, anastasio, et, al, 2016, clark, winterowd, 2012, tucker, et, al, 2016, have, evaluated, the, impact, of, iht, on, health, outcomes, of, indigenous, communities, from, the, united, states, and, canada, iht, is, a, difficult, term, to, standardize, and, measure, because, of, the, vast, and, variable, diversity, of, indigenous, people, and, their, communities, therefore, it, is, an, arduous, task, to, assign, an, operational, definition, and, systematically, collect, data, when, studying, iht, many, of, the, studies, that, incorporate, iht, measure, it, in, different, ways, making, it, hard, to, compile, data, and, review, it, holistically, this, is, an, important, point, that, provides, context, for, the, following, studies, that, attempt, to, understand, the, relationship, between, iht, and, potential, adverse, health, impacts, some, of, the, methodologies, to, measure, iht, include, a, historical, losses, scale, hls, historical, losses, associated, symptoms, scale, hlass, and, residential, school, ancestry, studies, 23, hls, uses, a, survey, format, that, includes, 12, kinds, of, historical, losses, such, as, loss, of, language, and, loss, of, land, and, asks, participants, how, often, they, think, about, those, losses, 23, the, hlass, includes, 12, emotional, reactions, and, asks, participants, how, they, feel, when, they, think, about, these, losses, lastly, the, residential, school, ancestry, studies, ask, respondents, if, their, parents, grandparents, great, grandparents, or, elders, from, their, community, went, to, a, residential, school, to, understand, if, family, or, community, history, in, residential, schools, is, associated, with, negative, health, outcomes, 25, in, a, comprehensive, review, of, the, research, literature, joseph, gone, and, colleagues, compiled, and, compared, outcomes, for, studies, using, these, iht, measures, relative, to, the, health, outcomes, of, indigenous, peoples, the, study, defined, negative, health, outcomes, to, include, such, concepts, as, anxiety, suicidal, ideation, suicide, attempts, polysubstance, abuse, ptsd, depression, binge, eating, anger, and, sexual, abuse, the, connection, between, iht, and, health, conditions, is, complicated, because, of, the, difficult, nature, of, measuring, iht, the, unknown, directionality, of, iht, and, health, outcomes, and, because, the, term, indigenous, people, used, in, the, various, samples, comprises, a, huge, population, of, individuals, with, drastically, different, experiences, and, histories, that, being, said, some, studies, such, as, bombay, matheson, and, anisman, 2014, elias, et, al, 2012, and, pearce, et, al, 2008, found, that, indigenous, respondents, with, a, connection, to, residential, schools, have, more, negative, health, outcomes, e, g, suicide, ideation, suicide, attempts, and, depression, than, those, who, did, not, have, a, connection, to, residential, schools, additionally, indigenous, respondents, with, higher, hls, and, hlass, scores, had, one, or, more, negative, health, outcomes, while, there, are, many, studies, that, found, an, association, between, iht, and, adverse, health, outcomes, scholars, continue, to, suggest, that, it, remains, difficult, to, understand, the, impact, of, iht, iht, needs, to, be, systematically, measured, indigenous, people, also, need, to, be, understood, in, separate, categories, based, on, similar, experiences, location, and, background, as, opposed, to, being, categorized, as, one, monolithic, group, for, thousands, of, years, indigenous, peoples, domesticated, bred, and, cultivated, a, large, array, of, plant, species, these, species, now, constitute, between, 50, and, 60, of, all, crops, in, cultivation, worldwide, in, certain, cases, the, indigenous, peoples, developed, entirely, new, species, and, strains, through, artificial, selection, as, with, the, domestication, and, breeding, of, maize, from, wild, teosinte, grasses, in, the, valleys, of, southern, mexico, numerous, such, agricultural, products, retain, their, native, names, in, the, english, and, spanish, lexicons, the, south, american, highlands, became, a, center, of, early, agriculture, genetic, testing, of, the, wide, variety, of, cultivars, and, wild, species, suggests, that, the, potato, has, a, single, origin, in, the, area, of, southern, peru, from, a, species, in, the, solanum, brevicaule, complex, over, 99, of, all, modern, cultivated, potatoes, worldwide, are, descendants, of, a, subspecies, indigenous, to, south, central, chile, solanum, tuberosum, ssp, tuberosum, where, it, was, cultivated, as, long, as, 10, 000, years, ago, according, to, linda, newson, it, is, clear, that, in, pre, columbian, times, some, groups, struggled, to, survive, and, often, suffered, food, shortages, and, famines, while, others, enjoyed, a, varied, and, substantial, diet, persistent, drought, around, ad, 850, coincided, with, the, collapse, of, the, classic, maya, civilization, and, the, famine, of, one, rabbit, ad, 1454, was, a, major, catastrophe, in, mexico, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, began, practicing, farming, approximately, 4, 000, years, ago, late, in, the, archaic, period, of, north, american, cultures, technology, had, advanced, to, the, point, where, pottery, had, started, to, become, common, and, the, small, scale, felling, of, trees, had, become, feasible, concurrently, the, archaic, indigenous, peoples, began, using, fire, in, a, controlled, manner, they, carried, out, the, intentional, burning, of, vegetation, to, mimic, the, effects, of, natural, fires, that, tended, to, clear, forest, understories, it, made, travel, easier, and, facilitated, the, growth, of, herbs, and, berry, producing, plants, which, were, important, both, for, food, and, for, medicines, in, the, mississippi, river, valley, europeans, noted, that, native, americans, managed, groves, of, nut, and, fruit, trees, not, far, from, villages, and, towns, and, their, gardens, and, agricultural, fields, they, would, have, used, prescribed, burning, further, away, in, forest, and, prairie, areas, many, crops, first, domesticated, by, indigenous, peoples, are, now, produced, and, used, globally, most, notably, maize, or, corn, arguably, the, most, important, crop, in, the, world, other, significant, crops, include, cassava, chia, squash, pumpkins, zucchini, marrow, acorn, squash, butternut, squash, the, pinto, bean, phaseolus, beans, including, most, common, beans, tepary, beans, and, lima, beans, tomatoes, potatoes, sweet, potatoes, avocados, peanuts, cocoa, beans, used, to, make, chocolate, vanilla, strawberries, pineapples, peppers, species, and, varieties, of, capsicum, including, bell, peppers, jalape, os, paprika, and, chili, peppers, sunflower, seeds, rubber, brazilwood, chicle, tobacco, coca, blueberries, cranberries, and, some, species, of, cotton, studies, of, contemporary, indigenous, environmental, management, including, agro, forestry, practices, among, itza, maya, in, guatemala, and, hunting, and, fishing, among, the, menominee, of, wisconsin, suggest, that, longstanding, sacred, values, may, represent, a, summary, of, sustainable, millennial, traditions, numerous, native, american, dog, breeds, have, been, used, by, the, people, of, the, americas, such, as, the, canadian, eskimo, dog, the, carolina, dog, and, the, chihuahua, some, indigenous, peoples, in, the, great, plains, used, dogs, for, pulling, travois, while, others, like, the, tahltan, bear, dog, were, bred, to, hunt, larger, game, some, andean, cultures, also, bred, the, chiribaya, to, herd, llamas, the, vast, majority, of, indigenous, dog, breeds, in, the, americas, went, extinct, due, to, being, replaced, by, dogs, of, european, origin, the, fuegian, dog, was, a, domesticated, variation, of, the, culpeo, that, was, raised, by, several, cultures, in, tierra, del, fuego, like, the, selk, nam, and, the, yahgan, it, was, exterminated, by, argentine, and, chilean, settlers, due, to, supposedly, posing, as, a, threat, to, livestock, several, bird, species, such, as, turkeys, muscovy, ducks, puna, ibis, and, neotropic, cormorants, were, domesticated, by, various, peoples, in, mesoamerica, and, south, america, to, be, used, for, poultry, in, the, andean, region, indigenous, peoples, domesticated, llamas, and, alpacas, to, produce, fiber, and, meat, the, llama, was, the, only, beast, of, burden, in, the, americas, before, european, colonization, guinea, pigs, were, domesticated, from, wild, cavies, to, be, raised, for, meat, consumption, in, the, andean, region, guinea, pigs, are, now, widely, raised, in, western, society, as, household, pets, in, oasisamerica, several, cultures, raised, scarlet, macaws, imported, from, mesoamerica, for, their, feathers, in, the, maya, civilization, stingless, bees, were, domesticated, to, produce, balch, cochineal, were, harvested, by, mesoamerican, and, andean, civilizations, for, coloring, fabrics, via, carminic, acid, cultural, practices, in, the, americas, seem, to, have, been, shared, mostly, within, geographical, zones, where, distinct, ethnic, groups, adopt, shared, cultural, traits, similar, technologies, and, social, organizations, an, example, of, such, a, cultural, area, is, mesoamerica, where, millennia, of, coexistence, and, shared, development, among, the, peoples, of, the, region, produced, a, fairly, homogeneous, culture, with, complex, agricultural, and, social, patterns, another, well, known, example, is, the, north, american, plains, where, until, the, 19th, century, several, peoples, shared, the, traits, of, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, based, primarily, on, bison, hunting, the, languages, of, the, north, american, indians, have, been, classified, into, 56, groups, or, stock, tongues, in, which, the, spoken, languages, of, the, tribes, may, be, said, to, center, in, connection, with, speech, reference, may, be, made, to, gesture, language, which, was, highly, developed, in, parts, of, this, area, of, equal, interest, is, the, picture, writing, especially, well, developed, among, the, chippewas, and, delawares, beginning, in, the, 1st, millennium, bce, pre, columbian, cultures, in, mesoamerica, developed, several, indigenous, writing, systems, independent, of, any, influence, from, the, writing, systems, that, existed, in, other, parts, of, the, world, the, cascajal, block, is, perhaps, the, earliest, known, example, in, the, americas, of, what, may, be, an, extensive, written, text, the, olmec, hieroglyphs, tablet, has, been, indirectly, dated, from, ceramic, shards, found, in, the, same, context, to, approximately, 900, bce, which, is, around, the, same, time, that, the, olmec, occupation, of, san, lorenzo, tenochtitl, n, began, to, weaken, the, maya, writing, system, was, logosyllabic, a, combination, of, phonetic, syllabic, symbols, and, logograms, it, is, the, only, pre, columbian, writing, system, known, to, have, completely, represented, the, spoken, language, of, its, community, it, has, more, than, a, thousand, different, glyphs, but, a, few, are, variations, on, the, same, sign, or, have, the, same, meaning, many, appear, only, rarely, or, in, particular, localities, no, more, than, about, five, hundred, were, in, use, in, any, given, time, and, of, those, it, seems, only, about, two, hundred, including, variations, represented, a, particular, phoneme, or, syllable, the, zapotec, writing, system, one, of, the, earliest, in, the, americas, was, logographic, and, presumably, syllabic, there, are, remnants, of, zapotec, writing, in, inscriptions, on, some, of, the, monumental, architecture, of, the, period, but, so, few, inscriptions, are, extant, that, it, is, difficult, to, fully, describe, the, writing, system, the, oldest, example, of, the, zapotec, script, dating, from, around, 600, bce, is, on, a, monument, that, was, discovered, in, san, jos, mogote, aztec, codices, singular, codex, are, books, that, were, written, by, pre, columbian, and, colonial, era, aztecs, these, codices, are, some, of, the, best, primary, sources, for, descriptions, of, aztec, culture, the, pre, columbian, codices, are, largely, pictorial, they, do, not, contain, symbols, that, represent, spoken, or, written, language, by, contrast, colonial, era, codices, contain, not, only, aztec, pictograms, but, also, writing, that, uses, the, latin, alphabet, in, several, languages, classical, nahuatl, spanish, and, occasionally, latin, spanish, mendicants, in, the, sixteenth, century, taught, indigenous, scribes, in, their, communities, to, write, their, languages, using, latin, letters, and, there, are, a, large, number, of, local, level, documents, in, nahuatl, zapotec, mixtec, and, yucatec, maya, from, the, colonial, era, many, of, which, were, part, of, lawsuits, and, other, legal, matters, although, spaniards, initially, taught, indigenous, scribes, alphabetic, writing, the, tradition, became, self, perpetuating, at, the, local, level, the, spanish, crown, gathered, such, documentation, and, contemporary, spanish, translations, were, made, for, legal, cases, scholars, have, translated, and, analyzed, these, documents, in, what, is, called, the, new, philology, to, write, histories, of, indigenous, peoples, from, indigenous, viewpoints, the, wiigwaasabak, birch, bark, scrolls, on, which, the, ojibwa, anishinaabe, people, wrote, complex, geometrical, patterns, and, shapes, can, also, be, considered, a, form, of, writing, as, can, mi, kmaq, hieroglyphics, aboriginal, syllabic, writing, or, simply, syllabics, is, a, family, of, abugidas, used, to, write, some, indigenous, languages, of, the, algonquian, inuit, and, athabaskan, language, families, indigenous, music, can, vary, between, cultures, however, there, are, significant, commonalities, traditional, music, often, centers, around, drumming, and, singing, rattles, clapper, sticks, and, rasps, are, also, popular, percussive, instruments, both, historically, and, in, contemporary, cultures, flutes, are, made, of, river, cane, cedar, and, other, woods, the, apache, have, a, type, of, fiddle, and, fiddles, are, also, found, many, first, nations, and, m, tis, cultures, the, music, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, central, mexico, and, central, america, like, that, of, the, north, american, cultures, tends, to, be, spiritual, ceremonies, it, traditionally, includes, a, large, variety, of, percussion, and, wind, instruments, such, as, drums, flutes, sea, shells, used, as, trumpets, and, rain, tubes, no, remnants, of, pre, columbian, stringed, instruments, were, found, until, archaeologists, discovered, a, jar, in, guatemala, attributed, to, the, maya, of, the, late, classic, era, 600, 900, ce, this, jar, was, decorated, with, imagery, depicting, a, stringed, musical, instrument, which, has, since, been, reproduced, this, instrument, is, one, of, the, very, few, stringed, instruments, known, in, the, americas, before, the, introduction, of, european, musical, instruments, when, played, it, produces, a, sound, that, mimics, a, jaguar, s, growl, visual, arts, by, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, comprise, a, major, category, in, the, world, art, collection, contributions, include, pottery, paintings, jewelry, weavings, sculptures, basketry, carvings, and, beadwork, because, too, many, artists, were, posing, as, native, americans, and, alaska, natives, to, profit, from, the, cachet, of, indigenous, art, in, the, united, states, the, u, s, passed, the, indian, arts, and, crafts, act, of, 1990, requiring, artists, to, prove, that, they, were, enrolled, in, a, state, or, federally, recognized, tribe, to, support, the, ongoing, practice, of, american, indian, alaska, native, and, native, hawaiian, arts, and, cultures, in, the, united, states, the, ford, foundation, arts, advocates, and, american, indian, tribes, created, an, endowment, seed, fund, and, established, a, national, native, arts, and, cultures, foundation, in, 2007, after, the, entry, of, the, spaniards, the, process, of, spiritual, conquest, was, favored, among, other, things, by, the, liturgical, musical, service, to, which, the, natives, whose, musical, gifts, came, to, surprise, the, missionaries, were, integrated, the, musical, gifts, of, the, natives, were, of, such, magnitude, that, they, soon, learned, the, rules, of, counterpoint, and, polyphony, and, even, the, virtuous, handling, of, the, instruments, this, helped, to, ensure, that, it, was, not, necessary, to, bring, more, musicians, from, spain, which, significantly, annoyed, the, clergy, the, solution, that, was, proposed, was, not, to, employ, but, a, certain, number, of, indigenous, people, in, the, musical, service, not, to, teach, them, counterpoint, not, to, allow, them, to, play, certain, instruments, brass, breaths, for, example, in, oaxaca, mexico, and, finally, not, to, import, more, instruments, so, that, the, indigenous, people, would, not, have, access, to, them, the, latter, was, not, an, obstacle, to, the, musical, enjoyment, of, the, natives, who, experienced, the, making, of, instruments, particularly, rubbed, strings, violins, and, double, basses, or, plucked, third, it, is, there, where, we, can, find, the, origin, of, what, is, now, called, traditional, music, whose, instruments, have, their, tuning, and, a, typical, western, structure, the, following, table, provides, estimates, for, each, country, or, territory, in, the, americas, of, the, populations, of, indigenous, people, and, those, with, partial, indigenous, ancestry, each, expressed, as, a, percentage, of, the, overall, population, the, total, percentage, obtained, by, adding, both, of, these, categories, is, also, given, note, these, categories, are, inconsistently, defined, and, measured, differently, from, country, to, country, some, figures, are, based, on, the, results, of, population, wide, genetic, surveys, while, others, are, based, on, self, identification, or, observational, estimation, indigenous, peoples, in, canada, french, peuples, autochtones, au,

total, canadian, population, there, are, over, 600, recognized, first, nations, governments, or, bands, with, distinctive, cultures, languages, art, and, music, old, crow, flats, and, bluefish, caves, are, some, of, the, earliest, known, sites, of, human, habitation, in, canada, the, characteristics, of, indigenous, cultures, in, canada, prior, to, europen, colonization, included, permanent, settlements, agriculture, civic, and, ceremonial, architecture, complex, societal, hierarchies, and, trading, networks, m, tis, nations, of, mixed, ancestry, originated, in, the, mid, 17th, century,

colonies, in, canada, particularly, for, their, role, in, assisting, europeans, during, the, north, american, fur, trade, various, aboriginal, laws, treaties, and, legislation, have, been, enacted, between, european, immigrants, and, indigenous, groups, across, canada, the, impact, of, settler, colonialism, in, canada, can, be, seen, in, its, culture, history, politics, laws, and, legislatures, this, led, to, the, systematic, abolishment, of, indigenous, languages, traditions, religion, and, the, degradation, of, indigenous, communities, that, has, been, described, as, a, genocide, of, indigenous, peoples, the, greenlandic, inuit, kalaallisut, kalaallit, tunumiisut, tunumiit, inuktun, inughuit, are, the, indigenous, and, most, populous, ethnic, group, in, greenland, this, means,

populations, in, greater, antillean, islands, such, as, puerto, rico, and, cuba, to, a, lesser, extent, possesses, degrees, of, ta, no, ancestry, the, cayman, islands, were, the, only, island, group, in, the, caribbean, to, have, remained, unsettled, by, indigenous, peoples, before, the, colonial, era, historically, during, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, philippines, the, territory, was, ruled, as, a, province, of, the, mexico, centered, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, and, thus, many, mexicans, including, those, of, indgenous, aztec, and, tlaxcalan, descent, were, sent, as, colonists, there, chpt, 6, according, to, a, genetic, study, by, the, national, geographic, around, 2, of, the, philippine, population, are, native, american, in, descent, since, the, late, 20th, century, indigenous, peoples, in, the, americas, have, become, more, politically, active, in, asserting, their, treaty, rights, and, expanding, their, influence, some, have, organized, to, achieve, some, sort, of, self, determination, and, preservation, of, their, cultures, organizations, such, as, the, coordinator, of, indigenous, organizations, of, the, amazon, river, basin, and, the, indian, council, of, south, america, are, examples, of, movements, that, are, overcoming, national, borders, to, reunite, indigenous, populations, for, instance, those, across, the, amazon, basin, similar, movements, for, indigenous, rights, can, also, be, seen, in, canada, and, the, united, states, with, movements, like, the, international, indian, treaty, council, and, the, accession, of, native, indigenous, groups, into, the, unrepresented, nations, and, peoples, organization, there, has, been, a, recognition, of, indigenous, movements, on, an, international, scale, the, membership, of, the, united, nations, voted, to, adopt, the, declaration, on, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, despite, dissent, from, some, of, the, stronger, countries, of, the, americas, in, colombia, various, indigenous, groups, have, protested, the, denial, of, their, rights, people, organized, a, march, in, cali, in, october, 2008, to, demand, the, government, live, up, to, promises, to, protect, indigenous, lands, defend, the, indigenous, against, violence, and, reconsider, the, free, trade, pact, with, the, united, states, the, first, indigenous, president, of, the, americas, was, jos, mar, a, melo, of, pijao, descent, and, led, colombia, in, 1854, starting, on, april, 17, 1854, jos, was, born, on, october, 9, 1800, in, chaparral, tolima, and, before, his, presidency, he, fought, alongside, simon, bolivar, in, the, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, jos, mar, a, melo, led, the, republic, of, new, granada, during, the, colombian, civil, war, of, 1854, but, eventually, lost, and, was, exiled, on, december, 4, 1854, the, first, indigenous, candidate, to, be, democratically, elected, as, head, of, a, country, in, the, americas, was, benito, ju, rez, a, zapotec, mexican, who, was, elected, president, of, mexico, in, 1858, and, led, the, country, until, 1872, and, led, the, country, to, victory, during, the, second, french, intervention, in, mexico, in, 1930, luis, miguel, s, nchez, cerro, became, the, first, peruvian, president, with, indigenous, peruvian, ancestry, and, the, first, in, south, america, he, came, to, power, in, a, military, coup, in, 2005, evo, morales, of, the, aymara, people, was, the, first, indigenous, candidate, elected, as, president, of, bolivia, and, the, first, elected, in, south, america, genetic, history, of, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, primarily, focuses, on, human, y, chromosome, dna, haplogroups, and, human, mitochondrial, dna, haplogroups, y, dna, is, passed, solely, along, the, patrilineal, line, from, father, to, son, while, mtdna, is, passed, down, the, matrilineal, line, from, mother, to, offspring, of, both, sexes, neither, recombines, and, thus, y, dna, and, mtdna, change, only, by, chance, mutation, at, each, generation, with, no, intermixture, between, parents, genetic, material, autosomal, atdna, markers, are, also, used, but, differ, from, mtdna, or, y, dna, in, that, they, overlap, significantly, atdna, is, generally, used, to, measure, the, average, continent, of, ancestry, genetic, admixture, in, the, entire, human, genome, and, related, isolated, populations, genetic, comparisons, of, the, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, and, y, chromosome, of, native, americans, to, that, of, certain, siberian, and, central, asian, peoples, specifically, paleo, siberians, turkic, and, historically, the, okunev, culture, have, led, russian, researcher, i, a, zakharov, to, believe, that, among, all, the, previously, studied, asian, peoples, it, is, the, peoples, living, between, altai, and, lake, baikal, along, the, sayan, mountains, that, are, genetically, closest, to, indigenous, americans, some, scientific, evidence, links, them, to, north, asian, peoples, specifically, the, indigenous, peoples, of, siberia, such, as, the, ket, selkup, chukchi, and, koryak, peoples, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, have, been, linked, to, some, extent, to, north, asian, populations, by, the, distribution, of, blood, types, and, in, genetic, composition, as, reflected, by, molecular, data, and, limited, dna, studies, the, common, occurrence, of, the, asian, mtdna, haplogroups, a, b, c, and, d, among, eastern, asian, and, native, american, populations, has, been, noted, some, subclades, of, c, and, d, that, have, been, found, in, the, limited, populations, of, native, americans, who, have, agreed, to, dna, testing, bear, some, resemblance, to, the, c, and, d, subclades, in, mongolian, amur, japanese, korean, and, ainu, populations, available, genetic, patterns, lead, to, two, main, theories, of, genetic, episodes, affecting, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, first, with, the, initial, peopling, of, the, americas, and, secondly, with, european, colonization, of, the, americas, the, former, is, the, determinant, factor, for, the, number, of, gene, lineages, zygosity, mutations, and, founding, haplotypes, present, in, today, s, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, populations, the, most, popular, theory, among, anthropologists, is, the, bering, strait, theory, of, human, settlement, of, the, new, world, occurring, in, stages, from, the, bering, sea, coastline, with, a, possible, initial, layover, of, 10, 000, to, 20, 000, years, in, beringia, for, the, small, founding, population, the, micro, satellite, diversity, and, distributions, of, the, y, lineage, specific, to, south, america, indicate, that, certain, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, populations, have, been, isolated, since, the, initial, colonization, of, the, region, the, na, den, inuit, and, indigenous, populations, of, alaska, exhibit, haplogroup, q, y, dna, mutations, however, are, distinct, from, other, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, with, various, mtdna, and, atdna, mutations, this, suggests, that, the, earliest, migrants, into, the, northern, extremes, of, north, america, and, greenland, derived, from, later, migrant, populations, multiple, recent, findings, on, autosomal, dna, and, full, genome, revealed, more, information, about, the, formation, settlement, and, external, relationships, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, to, other, populations, native, americans, are, very, closely, related, to, the, paleosiberian, tribes, of, siberia, and, to, the, ancient, samples, of, the, mal, ta, buret, culture, ancient, north, eurasians, as, well, as, to, the, ancient, beringians, native, americans, also, share, a, relatively, higher, genetic, affinity, with, east, asian, peoples, native, american, genetic, ancestry, is, occasionally, dubbed, as, amerindian, this, type, of, ancestry, largely, overlaps, with, paleosiberian, ancestry, but, is, differentiated, from, neo, siberian, ancestry, which, represents, historical, expansions, from, northeast, asia, and, is, today, widespread, among, siberian, populations, the, ancestors, of, native, americans, used, a, single, migration, route, most, likely, through, beringia, and, subsequently, populated, all, of, the, americas, in, a, time, range, between, 25, 000, and, 15, 000, years, ago, possible, contact, between, native, americans, and, polynesians, dates, back, to, 1, 400, years, ago, previously, hypothesized, paleo, indian, groups, turned, out, to, be, genetically, identical, to, modern, native, americans, the, controversial, claim, that, the, first, peoples, came, from, europe, via, the, north, atlantic, based, on, an, ostensible, similarity, in, stone, tool, technology, between, the, solutrean, culture, of, pleistocene, europe, and, clovis, in, north, america, was, undermined, by, the, genome, of, the, anzick, clovis, child, which, sits, squarely, on, the, branch, of, ancestral, native, american, peoples, no, ancient, or, present, day, genome, or, mtdna, or, y, chromosome, marker, in, the, americas, has, shown, any, direct, affinities, to, upper, palaeolithic, european, populations, the, date, for, the, formation, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, gene, pool, ranges, from, 36, 000, to, 25, 000, years, ago, with, their, internal, diverging, being, around, 21, 000, years, ago, during, the, settlement, of, the, americas, native, americans, formed, from, the, admixture, of, a, lineage, that, diverged, from, ancient, east, asian, people, around, 36, 000, years, ago, somewhere, in, southern, china, and, subsequently, migrated, northwards, into, siberia, where, they, merged, with, a, paleolithic, siberian, population, known, as, ancient, north, eurasians, ane, deeply, related, to, european, hunter, gatherers, giving, rise, to, both, indigenous, peoples, of, siberia, and, ancestral, native, americans, both, paleo, siberians, and, ancestral, native, americans, derive, between, 32, and, 44, of, their, ancestry, from, ancient, north, eurasians, ane, and, 56, 68, ancestry, from, ancient, east, asians, based, on, a, 2023, mitochondrial, dna, study, a, subsequent, wave, of, migration, from, northern, china, originating, near, the, present, day, cities, of, beijing, and, tianjin, occurred, as, recently, as, 9000, bce, following, a, previously, unknown, coastal, route, from, asia, to, america, africa,
