firefighting, is, a, profession, aimed, at, controlling, and, extinguishing, fire, a, person, who, engages, in, firefighting, is, known, as, a, firefighter, or, fireman, firefighters, typically, undergo, a, high, degree, of, technical, training, this, involves, structural, firefighting, and, wildland, firefighting, specialized, training, includes, aircraft, firefighting, shipboard, firefighting, aerial, firefighting, maritime, firefighting, and, proximity, firefighting, firefighting, is, a, dangerous, profession, due, to, the, toxic, environment, created, by, combustible, materials, with, major, risks, being, smoke, oxygen, deficiency, elevated, temperatures, poisonous, atmospheres, and, violent, air, flows, to, combat, some, of, these, risks, firefighters, carry, self, contained, breathing, apparatus, additional, hazards, include, falls, a, constant, peril, while, navigating, unfamiliar, layouts, or, confined, spaces, amid, shifting, debris, under, limited, visibility, and, structural, collapse, that, can, exacerbate, the, problems, encountered, in, a, toxic, environment, the, first, step, in, a, firefighting, operation, is, reconnaissance, to, search, for, the, origin, of, the, fire, and, to, identify, the, specific, risks, fires, can, be, extinguished, by, water, fuel, or, oxidant, removal, or, chemical, flame, inhibition, though, because, fires, are, classified, depending, on, the, elements, involved, such, as, grease, paper, electrical, etcetera, a, specific, type, of, fire, extinguisher, may, be, required, the, classification, is, based, on, the, type, of, fires, that, the, extinguisher, is, more, suitable, for, in, the, united, states, the, types, of, fire, are, described, by, the, national, fire, protection, association, the, earliest, known, firefighters, were, in, the, city, of, rome, in, 60, a, d, emperor, nero, established, a, corps, of, vigils, vigiles, to, protect, rome, after, a, disastrous, fire, it, consisted, of, 7, 000, people, equipped, with, buckets, and, axes, who, fought, fires, and, served, as, police, in, the, 3rd, century, b, c, an, alexandrian, greek, named, ctesibius, made, a, double, force, pump, called, a, siphona, as, water, rose, in, the, chamber, it, compressed, the, air, inside, which, forced, the, water, to, eject, in, a, steady, stream, through, a, pipe, and, nozzle, in, the, 16th, century, syringes, were, also, used, as, firefighting, tools, the, larger, ones, being, mounted, on, wheels, another, traditional, firefighting, method, that, survived, was, the, bucket, brigade, involving, two, lines, of, people, formed, between, the, water, source, and, the, fire, typically, men, in, one, of, the, lines, would, pass, along, the, full, buckets, of, water, toward, the, fire, while, in, the, other, line, women, and, children, would, pass, back, the, empty, buckets, to, be, refilled, in, the, 17th, century, the, first, fire, engines, were, made, notably, in, amsterdam, in, 1721, the, english, inventor, richard, newsham, made, a, popular, fire, engine, that, was, essentially, a, rectangular, box, on, wheels, filled, using, a, bucket, brigade, to, provide, a, reservoir, while, hand, powered, pumps, supplied, sufficient, water, pressure, to, douse, fires, at, a, distance, ancient, rome, did, not, have, municipal, firefighters, instead, private, individuals, relied, on, their, slaves, or, supporters, to, take, action, they, would, not, only, form, bucket, brigades, or, attempt, to, smother, smaller, fires, but, would, also, demolish, or, raze, nearby, buildings, to, slow, the, spread, of, the, fire, however, there, is, no, mention, of, fires, being, extinguished, rather, they, were, contained, and, burned, themselves, out, ancient, rome, did, not, have, an, organized, firefighting, force, until, the, vigiles, were, formed, during, the, reign, of, augustus, the, first, ever, roman, fire, brigade, was, created, by, marcus, licinius, crassus, fires, were, almost, a, daily, occurrence, in, rome, and, crassus, took, advantage, of, the, fact, that, rome, had, no, fire, department, by, creating, his, own, brigade, 500, men, strong, which, rushed, to, burning, buildings, at, the, first, cry, of, alarm, upon, arriving, at, the, scene, however, the, firefighters, did, nothing, while, crassus, offered, to, buy, the, burning, building, from, the, distressed, property, owner, at, a, miserable, price, if, the, owner, agreed, to, sell, the, property, his, men, would, put, out, the, fire, if, the, owner, refused, then, they, would, simply, let, the, structure, burn, to, the, ground, after, buying, many, properties, this, way, he, rebuilt, them, and, often, leased, the, properties, to, their, original, owners, or, new, tenants, prior, to, the, great, fire, of, london, in, 1666, some, parishes, in, the, uk, had, begun, to, organize, rudimentary, firefighting, crews, after, the, great, fire, nicholas, barbon, introduced, the, first, fire, insurance, in, order, to, reduce, insurance, costs, barbon, also, formed, his, own, fire, brigade, and, other, companies, followed, suit, by, the, start, of, the, 1800s, insured, buildings, were, identified, with, a, badge, or, mark, indicating, that, they, were, eligible, for, a, company, s, firefighting, services, it, is, a, common, belief, that, buildings, not, insured, with, a, particular, company, were, left, by, its, firefighters, to, burn, unless, they, happened, to, be, adjacent, to, an, insured, building, in, which, case, it, was, often, in, the, company, s, interest, to, prevent, the, fire, from, spreading, this, is, a, common, misconception, in, 1833, fire, insurance, companies, in, london, merged, to, form, the, london, fire, company, establishment, steam, powered, apparatuses, were, first, introduced, in, the, 1850s, allowing, a, greater, quantity, of, water, to, be, directed, onto, a, fire, in, the, early, 1930s, they, were, superseded, by, versions, powered, by, an, internal, combustion, engine, in, world, war, ii, the, auxiliary, fire, service, and, later, the, national, fire, service, were, established, to, supplement, local, fire, services, before, 1938, there, was, no, countrywide, standard, for, firefighting, terms, procedures, ranks, or, equipment, such, as, hose, couplings, in, the, month, of, august, in, 1939, with, war, looking, very, possible, the, fire, service, s, act, of, 1938, came, into, effect, this, unified, great, britain, s, fire, service, and, prepared, them, for, the, german, war, machine, during, the, london, blitz, 700, fire, men, and, 20, fire, women, as, known, during, the, time, period, died, as, a, result, of, heavy, bombing, 91, of, these, perished, at, the, same, time, defending, london, by, the, end, of, the, london, blitz, 327, firefighters, had, lost, their, lives, in, january, 1608, a, fire, destroyed, many, colonists, provisions, and, lodgings, in, jamestown, virginia, by, the, mid, 1600s, boston, new, amsterdam, later, new, york, city, and, philadelphia, were, all, plagued, by, fires, and, volunteer, fire, brigades, began, to, form, in, 1736, benjamin, franklin, founded, the, union, fire, company, in, philadelphia, which, became, the, standard, for, volunteer, fire, organizations, these, firefighters, had, two, critical, tools, salvage, bags, and, so, called, bed, keys, salvage, bags, were, used, to, quickly, collect, and, save, valuables, and, bed, keys, were, used, to, separate, the, wooden, frame, of, a, bed, often, the, most, valuable, item, in, a, home, at, the, time, into, pieces, for, safe, and, rapid, removal, from, the, fire, the, first, american, attempt, at, fire, insurance, failed, after, a, large, fire, in, charlestown, massachusetts, in, 1736, later, in, 1740, benjamin, franklin, organized, the, philadelphia, contributionship, to, provide, fire, insurance, which, was, more, successful, the, contributionship, adopted, fire, marks, to, easily, identify, insured, buildings, firefighting, started, to, become, formalized, with, rules, for, providing, buckets, ladders, and, hooks, and, with, the, formation, of, volunteer, companies, a, chain, of, command, was, also, established, a, firefighter, s, goals, are, to, save, lives, protect, property, and, protect, the, environment, a, fire, can, rapidly, spread, and, endanger, many, lives, but, with, modern, firefighting, techniques, catastrophe, can, often, be, avoided, to, prevent, fires, from, starting, a, firefighter, s, duties, may, include, public, education, about, fire, safety, and, conducting, fire, inspections, of, locations, to, verify, their, adherence, to, local, fire, codes, firefighting, requires, technical, proficiency, of, operational, tactics, equipment, and, scene, awareness, firefighters, must, also, have, or, be, able, to, acquire, knowledge, of, department, organizations, operations, and, procedures, and, the, district, or, city, street, system, they, will, have, to, negotiate, in, order, to, perform, their, duties, they, must, meet, minimum, physical, fitness, standards, and, learn, various, firefighting, duties, within, a, reasonable, period, examples, are, specialized, areas, of, operations, may, require, subject, specific, training, examples, are, full, time, career, firefighters, typically, follow, a, 24, hour, shift, schedule, although, some, fire, departments, work, 8, or, 12, hour, shifts, australian, firefighters, work, a, 10, 14, shift, in, which, the, day, shift, works, ten, hours, and, the, night, shift, works, 14, hours, firefighting, personnel, are, split, up, into, alternating, shifts, usually, the, 24, hour, shifts, are, followed, by, two, days, off, the, shift, personnel, arrive, for, roll, call, at, a, specified, time, ready, to, complete, a, regular, tour, of, duty, while, on, shift, the, firefighter, remains, at, the, fire, station, unless, relieved, or, assigned, other, duties, in, fire, fighting, there, are, also, people, designated, as, fire, wardens, also, known, as, chief, officers, their, duties, vary, some, may, ensure, evacuation, of, that, part, of, the, building, for, which, they, are, responsible, others, may, be, responsible, for, fire, control, in, a, particular, area, direct, a, crew, in, the, suppression, of, forest, fires, or, function, as, fire, patrolmen, in, a, logging, area, the, chief, officer, is, in, charge, of, their, firefighters, during, fires, or, emergencies, and, is, expected, to, command, and, control, the, overall, situation, while, effectively, combating, a, fire, or, other, emergency, chief, officers, must, be, able, to, evaluate, their, firefighters, use, sound, judgement, when, deciding, when, it, is, time, to, withdraw, firefighters, from, a, fire, and, react, calmly, in, emergency, situations, the, chief, officer, must, direct, the, activities, of, a, fire, department, and, supervise, all, firefighting, activities, requiring, extensive, knowledge, of, city, layouts, the, location, of, streets, fire, hydrants, and, fire, alarm, boxes, and, the, principal, buildings, a, chief, officer, must, be, familiar, with, sources, of, fires, including, explosives, hazardous, chemicals, and, the, combustion, qualities, of, materials, in, buildings, homes, and, industrial, plants, in, certain, jurisdictions, civilians, can, get, certified, to, be, a, fire, warden, and, some, cities, require, certain, types, of, buildings, such, as, high, rises, to, have, a, certain, number, of, fire, wardens, for, example, the, city, of, houston, in, the, united, states, requires, every, tenant, in, a, high, rise, to, have, at, least, one, fire, warden, for, every, 7500, sq, ft, occupied, and, a, minimum, of, two, fire, wardens, per, floor, in, this, example, their, duties, include, investigating, any, fire, alarms, see, if, there, really, is, a, fire, and, if, so, its, nature, ensuring, the, fire, department, is, contacted, directing, the, evacuation, of, the, facility, activating, or, delaying, activation, of, fire, suppression, equipment, such, as, halon, and, sprinklers, delayed, in, case, of, a, false, alarm, meeting, the, fire, department, and, taking, them, to, the, location, of, the, alarm, or, to, the, fire, past, any, security, or, locked, doors, and, if, necessary, fighting, the, fire, until, the, fire, department, arrives, the, u, s, forest, service, publishes, guidelines, for, the, minimum, distance, a, firefighter, should, be, from, a, flame, as, stated, in, the, national, wildfire, coordinating, group, s, incident, response, pocket, guide, a, safety, zone, is, an, area, where, a, firefighter, can, survive, without, a, fire, shelter, and, should, be, at, least, four, times, the, maximum, continuous, flame, height, however, this, figure, only, takes, into, account, the, effects, of, radiant, heat, and, does, not, consider, topography, nor, wind, safety, zones, can, be, natural, features, such, as, rock, screes, meadows, and, river, bars, or, human, made, features, such, a, parking, lots, or, areas, that, have, been, cleared, of, vegetation, through, mechanical, means, one, of, the, major, hazards, associated, with, firefighting, operations, is, the, toxic, environment, created, by, combusting, materials, the, four, major, hazards, are, to, deal, with, such, hazards, firefighters, carry, a, self, contained, breathing, apparatus, scba, an, open, circuit, positive, pressure, system, to, prevent, smoke, inhalation, these, are, not, oxygen, tanks, oxygen, as, a, powerful, fire, accelerant, would, represent, a, grave, risk, when, combined, with, virtually, anything, combustible, in, the, presence, of, fire, but, use, compressed, air, in, a, similar, manner, to, scuba, diving, gear, a, firefighter, s, scba, usually, hold, 30, to, 45, minutes, of, air, depending, on, the, size, of, the, tank, and, the, rate, of, consumption, during, strenuous, activities, while, this, gear, helps, to, eliminate, the, risks, firefighters, are, still, exposed, to, smoke, toxic, dust, fumes, and, radiation, that, have, contributed, to, firefighters, being, 14, more, likely, to, develop, cancer, obvious, risks, associated, with, the, immense, heat, generated, by, a, fire, even, without, direct, contact, with, the, flames, direct, flame, impingement, such, as, conductive, heat, and, radiant, heat, can, cause, serious, burns, even, from, great, distances, there, are, a, number, of, comparably, serious, heat, related, risks, such, as, burns, from, hot, gases, e, g, air, steam, and, hot, and, or, toxic, smoke, prolonged, intense, exertion, in, hot, environments, also, increases, firefighters, risk, for, health, related, illnesses, such, as, rhabdomyolysis, accordingly, firefighters, are, equipped, with, personal, protective, equipment, ppe, that, includes, fire, resistant, clothing, such, as, nomex, or, polybenzimidazole, fiber, pbi, and, helmets, that, limit, the, transmission, of, heat, towards, the, body, no, ppe, however, can, completely, protect, the, user, from, the, effects, of, all, possible, fire, conditions, heat, can, cause, flammable, liquid, contained, in, tanks, to, explode, violently, producing, what, is, called, a, bleve, boiling, liquid, expanding, vapor, explosion, some, chemical, products, such, as, ammonium, nitrate, fertilizers, can, also, explode, potentially, causing, physical, trauma, from, blast, or, shrapnel, injuries, sufficient, heat, causes, human, flesh, to, burn, as, fuel, or, the, water, within, to, boil, leading, to, potentially, severe, medical, problems, furthers, risks, include, the, occurrences, of, backdrafts, backdrafts, occur, when, there, is, a, large, amount, of, oxygen, introduced, to, an, oxygen, depleted, fire, if, a, fire, is, compartmentalized, and, most, or, all, of, the, oxygen, has, been, burned, up, there, is, a, high, risk, of, backdraft, if, something, such, as, a, window, or, door, is, opened, introducing, oxygen, to, a, low, burning, fire, can, be, devastating, as, it, will, ignite, all, of, the, oxygen, along, the, way, it, can, also, be, heard, from, miles, away, as, it, has, a, concussive, blast, that, adds, to, the, effect, firefighters, need, to, have, extreme, communication, at, all, times, on, the, fire, ground, as, one, broken, window, at, the, wrong, time, could, seriously, harm, anyone, operating, on, the, building, depending, on, the, heat, of, the, fire, burns, can, occur, in, a, fraction, of, a, second, additional, risks, of, fire, are, the, obscuring, of, vision, due, to, smoke, potentially, causing, a, fall, or, disorientation, becoming, trapped, in, a, fire, and, structural, collapse, three, hours, of, fighting, a, fire, stiffens, arteries, and, impairs, cardiac, function, in, firefighters, according, to, a, study, by, bo, fernhall, a, professor, in, the, department, of, kinesiology, and, community, health, in, the, college, of, applied, health, sciences, and, gavin, horn, director, of, research, at, the, illinois, fire, service, institute, the, conditions, observed, in, healthy, male, firefighters, are, also, apparent, found, in, weightlifters, and, endurance, athletes, once, extinguished, fire, debris, cleanup, poses, several, safety, and, health, risks, for, workers, many, hazardous, substances, are, commonly, found, in, fire, debris, silica, can, be, found, in, concrete, roofing, tiles, or, it, may, be, a, naturally, occurring, element, occupational, exposures, to, silica, dust, can, cause, silicosis, lung, cancer, pulmonary, tuberculosis, airway, diseases, and, some, additional, non, respiratory, diseases, inhalation, of, asbestos, can, result, in, various, diseases, including, asbestosis, lung, cancer, and, mesothelioma, sources, of, metals, exposure, include, burnt, or, melted, electronics, cars, refrigerators, stoves, etc, fire, debris, cleanup, workers, may, be, exposed, to, these, metals, or, their, combustion, products, in, the, air, or, on, their, skin, these, metals, may, include, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, and, many, more, polyaromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, some, of, which, are, carcinogenic, come, from, the, incomplete, combustion, of, organic, materials, and, are, often, found, as, a, result, of, structural, and, wildland, fires, safety, hazards, of, fire, cleanup, include, the, risk, of, reignition, of, smoldering, debris, electrocution, from, downed, or, exposed, electrical, lines, or, in, instances, where, water, has, come, into, contact, with, electrical, equipment, structures, that, have, been, burned, may, be, unstable, and, at, risk, of, sudden, collapse, standard, personal, protective, equipment, for, fire, cleanup, include, hard, hats, goggles, or, safety, glasses, heavy, work, gloves, earplugs, or, other, hearing, protection, steel, toe, boots, and, fall, protection, devices, hazard, controls, for, electrical, injury, include, assuming, all, power, lines, are, energized, until, confirmation, they, are, de, energized, and, grounding, power, lines, to, guard, against, electrical, feedback, and, using, appropriate, personal, protective, equipment, proper, respiratory, protection, can, protect, against, hazardous, substances, proper, ventilation, of, an, area, is, an, engineering, control, that, can, be, used, to, avoid, or, minimize, exposure, to, hazardous, substances, when, ventilation, is, insufficient, or, dust, cannot, be, avoided, personal, protective, equipment, such, as, n95, respirators, can, be, used, the, first, step, in, a, firefighting, operation, is, reconnaissance, to, search, for, the, origin, of, the, fire, which, may, not, be, obvious, for, an, indoor, fire, especially, if, there, are, no, witnesses, to, identify, any, specific, risks, and, to, detect, possible, casualties, an, outdoor, fire, may, not, require, reconnaissance, but, a, fire, in, a, cellar, or, an, underground, car, park, with, only, a, few, centimeters, of, visibility, may, require, long, reconnaissance, to, identify, the, source, of, the, fire, the, reading, of, a, fire, is, the, analysis, by, firefighters, of, indications, of, thermal, events, such, as, flashover, backdraft, or, smoke, explosion, it, is, performed, during, reconnaissance, and, fire, suppression, maneuvers, the, main, signs, are, spraying, water, on, the, ceiling, in, short, pulses, of, a, diffused, spray, e, g, a, cone, with, an, opening, angle, of, 60, can, be, undertaken, to, test, the, heat, of, smoke, if, the, temperature, is, moderate, the, water, falls, down, in, drops, with, a, sound, like, rain, if, the, temperature, is, high, the, water, vaporizes, with, a, hiss, the, sign, of, a, potentially, extremely, dangerous, impending, flashover, ideally, part, of, reconnaissance, is, consulting, a, plan, for, the, building, that, provides, information, about, structures, firefighter, hazards, and, in, some, cases, the, most, appropriate, strategies, and, tactics, for, fighting, a, fire, in, that, context, there, are, four, elements, needed, to, start, and, sustain, a, fire, and, or, flame, temperature, a, fuel, an, oxidizing, agent, oxygen, and, a, chemical, reaction, a, fire, can, be, extinguished, by, taking, away, any, of, the, four, components, the, fuel, is, the, substance, being, oxidized, or, burned, in, the, combustion, process, the, most, common, fuels, contain, carbon, along, with, combinations, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, heat, is, the, energy, component, of, a, fire, when, it, comes, into, contact, with, a, fuel, it, provides, the, energy, necessary, for, ignition, causes, the, continuous, production, and, ignition, of, fuel, vapors, or, gases, so, that, the, combustion, reaction, can, continue, and, causes, the, vaporization, of, solid, and, liquid, fuels, the, resulting, self, sustained, chemical, chain, reaction, is, complex, and, requires, fuel, an, oxidizer, and, heat, energy, to, come, together, in, a, very, specific, way, an, oxidizing, agent, is, a, material, or, substance, that, will, release, gases, including, oxygen, when, the, proper, conditions, exist, it, is, crucial, to, the, sustainment, of, a, flame, or, fire, using, water, is, one, common, method, to, extinguish, a, fire, water, extinguishes, a, fire, by, cooling, which, removes, heat, because, of, water, s, ability, to, absorb, massive, amounts, of, heat, as, it, converts, to, water, vapor, without, heat, the, fuel, cannot, keep, the, oxidizer, from, reducing, the, fuel, in, order, to, sustain, the, fire, water, also, extinguishes, a, fire, by, smothering, it, when, water, is, heated, to, its, boiling, point, it, converts, to, water, vapor, when, this, conversion, takes, place, it, dilutes, the, oxygen, in, the, air, above, the, fire, thus, removing, one, of, the, elements, that, the, fire, requires, to, burn, this, can, also, be, done, with, foam, another, way, to, extinguish, a, fire, is, fuel, removal, this, can, be, accomplished, by, stopping, the, flow, of, liquid, or, gaseous, fuel, by, removing, solid, fuel, in, the, path, of, a, fire, or, by, allowing, the, fire, to, burn, until, all, the, fuel, is, consumed, at, which, point, the, fire, will, self, extinguish, one, final, extinguishing, method, is, chemical, flame, inhibition, this, can, be, accomplished, by, applying, dry, chemical, or, halogenated, agents, that, interrupt, the, chemical, chain, reaction, and, stop, flaming, this, method, is, effective, on, gas, and, liquid, fuel, because, they, must, have, flame, to, burn, sound, waves, have, been, successfully, used, in, a, device, fabricated, by, two, george, mason, university, senior, engineering, students, viet, tran, and, seth, robertson, but, the, procedure, is, still, awaiting, a, patent, 2015, one, common, way, to, extinguish, a, fire, is, to, spray, it, with, water, the, water, has, two, roles, it, vaporizes, when, it, comes, in, contact, with, fire, and, this, vapor, displaces, the, oxygen, the, volume, of, water, vapor, is, 1, 700, times, greater, than, liquid, water, at, 1, 000, f, 538, c, it, expands, over, 4, 000, times, this, leaves, the, fire, without, enough, of, the, combustive, agent, and, it, dies, out, the, vaporization, of, water, also, absorbs, heat, it, thereby, cools, the, smoke, air, walls, and, objects, that, could, act, as, further, fuel, and, thus, prevents, one, of, the, means, by, which, fires, grow, which, is, by, jumping, to, nearby, heat, fuel, sources, to, start, new, fires, which, then, combine, water, extinguishment, is, thus, a, combination, of, asphyxia, cutting, off, the, oxygen, supply, and, cooling, the, flame, itself, is, suppressed, by, asphyxia, but, the, cooling, is, the, most, important, element, in, mastering, a, fire, in, a, closed, area, water, may, be, accessed, from, a, pressurized, fire, hydrant, pumped, from, water, sources, such, as, lakes, or, rivers, delivered, by, tanker, truck, or, dropped, from, water, bombers, which, are, aircraft, adapted, as, tankers, for, fighting, forest, fires, an, armored, vehicle, firefighting, tank, may, be, used, where, access, to, the, area, is, difficult, for, outdoor, fires, the, seat, of, the, fire, is, sprayed, with, a, straight, spray, the, cooling, effect, immediately, follows, the, asphyxia, caused, by, vaporization, and, reduces, the, further, amount, of, water, required, this, is, because, water, droplets, upon, forming, in, to, water, mist, increase, their, surface, area, by, a, large, magnitude, greatly, increasing, the, endothermic, cooling, effect, and, robbing, the, fire, of, oxygen, a, straight, spray, is, used, so, the, water, arrives, massively, to, the, seat, of, the, fire, before, it, vaporizes, a, strong, spray, may, also, have, a, mechanical, effect, it, can, disperse, the, combustible, product, and, thus, prevent, the, fire, from, starting, again, spray, is, always, aimed, at, a, surface, or, an, object, for, this, reason, the, strategy, is, sometimes, called, a, two, dimensional, or, 2d, attack, an, outdoor, fire, is, always, fed, with, air, and, the, risk, to, people, is, limited, as, they, can, move, away, from, it, except, in, the, case, of, wildfires, or, bushfires, where, they, risk, being, easily, surrounded, by, the, flames, it, might, however, be, necessary, to, protect, specific, objects, like, houses, or, gas, tanks, against, infrared, radiation, and, thus, to, use, a, diffused, spray, between, the, fire, and, the, object, breathing, apparatus, is, often, required, as, there, is, still, the, risk, of, inhaling, smoke, or, poisonous, gases, until, the, 1970s, fires, were, usually, attacked, while, they, declined, using, the, same, strategy, as, for, open, air, fires, now, fires, are, attacked, in, their, development, phase, because, firefighters, arrive, sooner, at, the, site, of, a, fire, and, because, of, changes, in, building, construction, the, increasing, use, of, thermal, insulation, confines, the, heat, and, modern, materials, especially, polymers, produce, much, more, heat, than, do, traditional, materials, like, wood, plaster, stone, and, bricks, under, these, conditions, there, is, a, greater, risk, of, backdraft, and, flashover, directly, spraying, the, seat, of, the, fire, in, enclosed, areas, can, have, unfortunate, consequences, the, force, of, water, pushes, air, in, front, of, it, which, supplies, the, fire, with, extra, oxygen, before, the, water, the, most, important, issue, is, not, combating, the, flames, but, controlling, the, fire, for, example, cooling, the, smoke, so, that, it, cannot, spread, and, start, fires, further, away, and, endanger, the, lives, of, people, including, the, firefighters, when, a, fire, spreads, beyond, the, building, of, its, origin, and, spreads, throughout, the, neighborhood, it, is, called, a, conflagration, today, a, conflagration, is, a, large, fire, that, is, beyond, the, capability, of, the, fire, service, to, contain, the, volume, of, the, fire, must, be, cooled, before, its, seat, is, attacked, this, strategy, originally, of, swedish, origin, mats, rosander, krister, giselsson, was, adapted, by, london, fire, officer, paul, grimwood, following, a, decade, of, operational, use, in, the, busy, west, end, of, london, between, 1984, and, 1994, and, termed, the, three, dimensional, or, 3d, attack, use, of, a, diffuse, spray, was, first, proposed, by, chief, lloyd, layman, of, the, parkersburg, fire, department, at, the, 1950, fire, department, instructors, conference, fdic, held, in, memphis, using, grimwood, s, modified, 3d, attack, strategy, the, ceiling, is, first, sprayed, with, short, pulses, of, a, diffuse, spray, this, cools, the, smoke, which, is, then, less, likely, to, start, a, fire, when, it, moves, away, as, gas, cools, it, becomes, denser, charles, s, law, thus, it, also, reduces, the, mobility, of, the, smoke, and, avoids, a, backfire, of, water, vapor, also, the, diffuse, spray, creates, an, inert, water, vapor, sky, which, prevents, roll, over, rolls, of, flames, on, the, ceiling, created, by, hot, burning, gases, only, short, pulses, of, water, need, to, be, sprayed, otherwise, the, spraying, modifies, the, equilibrium, and, the, gases, mix, instead, of, remaining, stratified, the, hot, gases, initially, at, the, ceiling, move, around, the, room, and, the, temperature, rises, at, the, ground, which, is, dangerous, for, firefighters, an, alternative, is, to, cool, all, the, atmosphere, by, spraying, the, whole, atmosphere, as, if, drawing, letters, in, the, air, penciling, modern, methods, for, extinguishing, an, urban, fire, dictate, the, use, of, a, massive, initial, water, flow, e, g, 500, l, min, for, each, fire, hose, the, aim, is, to, absorb, as, much, heat, as, possible, at, the, beginning, to, stop, the, expansion, of, the, fire, and, to, reduce, the, smoke, if, the, flow, is, too, low, the, cooling, is, insufficient, and, the, steam, that, is, produced, can, burn, firefighters, the, drop, of, pressure, is, too, small, and, the, vapor, is, pushed, back, in, their, direction, although, it, may, seem, paradoxical, the, use, of, a, strong, flow, with, an, efficient, fire, hose, and, an, efficient, strategy, diffuse, spray, small, droplets, requires, a, smaller, amount, of, water, this, is, because, once, the, temperature, is, lowered, only, a, limited, amount, of, water, is, necessary, to, suppress, the, fire, seat, with, a, straight, spray, for, a, living, room, of, 50, m, 2, 60, sq, yd, the, required, amount, of, water, is, estimated, as, 60, l, 15, gal, french, firefighters, used, an, alternative, method, in, the, 1970s, spraying, water, on, the, hot, walls, to, create, a, water, vapor, atmosphere, and, asphyxiate, the, fire, this, method, is, no, longer, used, because, it, turned, out, to, be, risky, the, pressure, created, pushed, the, hot, gases, and, vapor, towards, the, firefighters, causing, severe, burns, and, pushed, the, hot, gases, into, other, rooms, where, they, could, start, other, fires, in, some, cases, the, use, of, water, is, undesirable, this, is, because, some, chemical, products, react, with, water, to, produce, poisonous, gases, or, they, may, even, burn, when, they, come, into, contact, with, water, e, g, sodium, see, water, reactive, substances, another, problem, is, that, some, products, float, on, water, such, as, hydrocarbons, gasoline, oil, and, alcohol, etc, a, burning, layer, can, then, be, spread, by, the, fire, if, a, pressurized, fuel, tank, is, endangered, by, fire, it, is, necessary, to, avoid, heat, shocks, that, may, damage, the, tank, if, it, is, sprayed, with, cooling, water, the, resulting, decompression, might, produce, a, bleve, boiling, liquid, expanding, vapor, explosion, electrical, fires, cannot, be, extinguished, with, water, since, the, water, could, act, as, a, conductor, in, such, cases, it, is, necessary, to, asphyxiate, the, fire, this, can, be, done, in, a, variety, of, ways, chemical, products, which, react, with, the, fuel, can, be, used, to, stop, the, combustion, a, layer, of, water, based, fire, retardant, foam, can, be, applied, by, the, fire, hose, in, order, to, separate, the, oxygen, in, the, air, from, the, fuel, carbon, dioxide, halon, or, sodium, bicarbonate, can, be, used, in, the, case, of, very, small, fires, and, in, the, absence, of, other, extinguishing, agents, covering, the, flame, with, a, fire, blanket, can, eliminate, oxygen, flow, to, the, fire, a, simple, and, usually, effective, way, to, put, out, a, fire, in, a, stove, top, pan, is, to, put, a, lid, on, the, pan, and, leave, it, there, one, of, the, main, risks, of, a, fire, is, the, smoke, because, it, carries, heat, and, poisonous, gases, and, obscures, vision, in, the, case, of, a, fire, in, a, closed, location, building, the, following, two, different, strategies, may, be, used, isolation, of, the, fire, or, ventilation, paul, grimwood, introduced, the, concept, of, tactical, ventilation, in, the, 1980s, to, encourage, a, better, thought, out, approach, to, this, aspect, of, firefighting, following, work, with, warrington, fire, research, consultants, frdg, 6, 94, his, terminology, and, concepts, were, adopted, officially, by, the, uk, fire, services, and, are, now, referred, to, throughout, revised, home, office, training, manuals, 1996, 97, grimwood, s, original, definition, of, his, 1991, unified, strategy, stated, that, tactical, ventilation, is, either, the, venting, or, containment, isolation, actions, by, on, scene, firefighters, used, to, take, control, from, the, outset, of, a, fire, s, burning, regime, in, an, effort, to, gain, tactical, advantage, during, interior, structural, firefighting, operations, when, properly, used, ventilation, improves, life, safety, fire, extinguishment, and, property, conservation, by, pulling, fire, away, from, trapped, occupants, and, objects, in, most, cases, of, structural, firefighting, windows, are, broken, or, removed, from, the, outside, of, the, building, to, provide, efficient, horizontal, ventilation, a, 4x4, foot, opening, may, also, be, cut, into, the, roof, directly, over, the, fire, room, this, allows, hot, smoke, and, gases, to, escape, through, the, opening, returning, the, conditions, inside, the, room, to, normal, it, is, important, to, coordinate, the, ventilation, with, an, interior, fire, attack, since, the, opening, of, a, ventilation, hole, supplies, more, air, and, thus, oxygen, to, the, fire, ventilation, may, also, limit, fire, spread, by, channeling, fire, toward, nearby, openings, and, allows, fire, fighters, to, safely, attack, the, fire, as, well, as, limit, smoke, heat, and, water, damage, positive, pressure, ventilation, ppv, consists, of, using, a, fan, to, create, excess, pressure, in, a, part, of, the, building, this, pressure, pushes, the, smoke, and, heat, out, of, the, building, and, thus, facilitates, rescue, and, fire, fighting, operations, it, is, necessary, to, have, an, exit, for, the, smoke, to, know, the, building, layout, well, to, predict, where, the, smoke, will, go, and, to, ensure, that, the, doors, ensuring, the, ventilation, remain, open, by, wedging, or, propping, them, the, main, risk, of, this, method, is, that, it, may, accelerate, the, fire, or, even, create, a, flash, over, for, example, if, the, smoke, and, the, heat, accumulate, in, a, dead, end, hydraulic, ventilation, is, the, process, of, directing, a, stream, of, water, from, the, inside, of, a, structure, out, the, window, using, a, fog, pattern, this, will, effectively, pull, smoke, out, of, room, smoke, ejectors, may, also, be, used, for, this, purpose, in, the, us, fires, are, sometimes, categorized, as, one, alarm, all, hands, two, alarm, three, alarm, or, higher, fires, there, is, no, standard, definition, for, what, this, means, quantifiably, though, it, always, refers, to, the, level, of, response, by, the, local, authorities, in, some, cities, the, numeric, rating, refers, to, the, number, of, fire, stations, that, have, been, summoned, to, the, fire, in, others, it, reflects, the, number, of, dispatches, requesting, additional, personnel, and, equipment, alarms, levels, are, generally, used, to, define, the, tiers, of, the, response, as, to, what, resources, are, to, be, used, for, example, a, structure, fire, response, draws, the, following, equipment, four, engine, pumper, companies, one, truck, ladder, aerial, quint, company, and, one, battalion, chief, unit, this, is, referred, to, as, an, initial, alarm, or, box, alarm, a, working, fire, request, for, the, same, incident, would, call, for, air, light, units, and, chief, officers, fireground, commanders, if, not, provided, in, the, original, dispatch, this, summarizes, the, response, to, a, first, alarm, fire, second, and, subsequent, alarms, call, for, two, engine, companies, and, one, truck, company, the, reason, behind, the, alarm, designation, is, so, the, incident, commander, does, not, have, to, list, each, apparatus, required, he, can, simply, say, give, me, a, second, alarm, here, instead, of, give, me, a, truck, company, and, two, engine, companies, along, with, requesting, where, they, should, come, from, categorization, of, fires, varies, among, fire, departments, a, single, alarm, for, one, department, may, be, a, second, alarm, for, another, response, always, depends, on, the, size, of, the, fire, and, the, department, in, the, fire, services, in, the, united, kingdom, the, scale, of, a, fire, is, measured, by, the, number, of, pumps, ordinary, fire, engines, that, were, present, for, example, a, fire, which, was, attended, by, 4, engines, would, be, recorded, as, a, 4, pump, fire
