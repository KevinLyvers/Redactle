https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness
happiness, is, a, complex, and, multifaceted, emotion, that, encompasses, a, range, of, positive, feelings, from, contentment, to, intense, joy, it, is, often, associated, with, positive, life, experiences, such, as, achieving, goals, spending, time, with, loved, ones, or, engaging, in, enjoyable, activities, however, happiness, can, also, arise, spontaneously, without, any, apparent, external, cause, happiness, is, closely, linked, to, well, being, and, overall, life, satisfaction, studies, have, shown, that, individuals, who, experience, higher, levels, of, happiness, tend, to, have, better, physical, and, mental, health, stronger, social, relationships, and, greater, resilience, in, the, face, of, adversity, the, pursuit, of, happiness, has, been, a, central, theme, in, philosophy, and, psychology, for, centuries, while, there, is, no, single, universally, accepted, definition, of, happiness, it, is, generally, understood, to, be, a, state, of, mind, characterized, by, positive, emotions, a, sense, of, purpose, and, a, feeling, of, fulfillment, happiness, is, subject, to, debate, on, usage, and, meaning, and, on, possible, differences, in, understanding, by, culture, the, word, is, mostly, used, in, relation, to, two, factors, some, usages, can, include, both, of, these, factors, subjective, well, being, swb, includes, measures, of, current, experience, emotions, moods, and, feelings, and, of, life, satisfaction, for, instance, sonja, lyubomirsky, has, described, happiness, as, the, experience, of, joy, contentment, or, positive, well, being, combined, with, a, sense, that, one, s, life, is, good, meaningful, and, worthwhile, eudaimonia, is, a, greek, term, variously, translated, as, happiness, welfare, flourishing, and, blessedness, xavier, landes, has, proposed, that, happiness, include, measures, of, subjective, wellbeing, mood, and, eudaimonia, these, differing, uses, can, give, different, results, whereas, nordic, countries, often, score, highest, on, swb, surveys, south, american, countries, score, higher, on, affect, based, surveys, of, current, positive, life, experiencing, the, implied, meaning, of, the, word, may, vary, depending, on, context, qualifying, happiness, as, a, polyseme, and, a, fuzzy, concept, a, further, issue, is, when, measurement, is, made, appraisal, of, a, level, of, happiness, at, the, time, of, the, experience, may, be, different, from, appraisal, via, memory, at, a, later, date, some, users, accept, these, issues, but, continue, to, use, the, word, because, of, its, convening, power, german, philosophy, professor, michela, summa, says, that, the, distinction, between, joy, and, happiness, is, that, joy, accompanies, the, process, through, and, through, whereas, happiness, seems, to, be, more, strictly, tied, to, the, moment, of, achievement, of, the, process, joy, is, not, only, a, direct, emotional, response, to, an, event, that, is, embedded, in, our, life, concerns, but, is, also, tightly, bound, to, the, present, moment, whereas, happiness, presupposes, an, evaluative, stance, concerning, one, period, of, one, s, life, or, one, s, own, life, as, a, whole, people, have, been, trying, to, measure, happiness, for, centuries, in, 1780, the, english, utilitarian, philosopher, jeremy, bentham, proposed, that, as, happiness, was, the, primary, goal, of, humans, it, should, be, measured, as, a, way, of, determining, how, well, the, government, was, performing, today, happiness, is, typically, measured, using, self, report, surveys, self, reporting, is, prone, to, cognitive, biases, and, other, sources, of, errors, such, as, peak, end, rule, studies, show, that, memories, of, felt, emotions, can, be, inaccurate, affective, forecasting, research, shows, that, people, are, poor, predictors, of, their, future, emotions, including, how, happy, they, will, be, happiness, economists, are, not, overly, concerned, with, philosophical, and, methodological, issues, and, continue, to, use, questionaries, to, measure, average, happiness, of, populations, several, scales, have, been, developed, to, measure, happiness, since, 2012, a, world, happiness, report, has, been, published, happiness, is, evaluated, as, in, how, happy, are, you, with, your, life, as, a, whole, and, in, emotional, reports, as, in, how, happy, are, you, now, and, people, seem, able, to, use, happiness, as, appropriate, in, these, verbal, contexts, using, these, measures, the, report, identifies, the, countries, with, the, highest, levels, of, happiness, in, subjective, well, being, measures, the, primary, distinction, is, between, cognitive, life, evaluations, and, emotional, reports, the, uk, began, to, measure, national, well, being, in, 2012, following, bhutan, which, had, already, been, measuring, gross, national, happiness, academic, economists, and, international, economic, organizations, are, arguing, for, and, developing, multi, dimensional, dashboards, which, combine, subjective, and, objective, indicators, to, provide, a, more, direct, and, explicit, assessment, of, human, wellbeing, there, are, many, different, contributors, to, adult, wellbeing, such, as, the, point, that, happiness, judgements, partly, reflect, the, presence, of, salient, constraints, and, that, fairness, autonomy, community, and, engagement, are, key, aspects, of, happiness, and, wellbeing, throughout, the, life, course, although, these, factors, play, a, role, in, happiness, they, do, not, all, need, to, improve, simultaneously, to, help, one, achieve, an, increase, in, happiness, happiness, has, been, found, to, be, quite, stable, over, time, as, of, 2016, no, evidence, of, happiness, causing, improved, physical, health, has, been, found, the, topic, is, being, researched, at, the, lee, kum, sheung, center, for, health, and, happiness, at, the, harvard, t, h, chan, school, of, public, health, a, positive, relationship, has, been, suggested, between, the, volume, of, the, brain, s, gray, matter, in, the, right, precuneus, area, and, one, s, subjective, happiness, score, sonja, lyubomirsky, has, estimated, that, 50, percent, of, a, given, human, s, happiness, level, could, be, genetically, determined, 10, percent, is, affected, by, life, circumstances, and, situation, and, a, remaining, 40, percent, of, happiness, is, subject, to, self, control, when, discussing, genetics, and, their, effects, on, individuals, it, is, important, to, first, understand, that, genetics, do, not, predict, behavior, it, is, possible, for, genes, to, increase, the, likelihood, of, individuals, being, happier, compared, to, others, but, they, do, not, 100, percent, predict, behavior, at, this, point, in, scientific, research, it, has, been, hard, to, find, a, lot, of, evidence, to, support, this, idea, that, happiness, is, affected, in, some, way, by, genetics, in, a, 2016, study, michael, minkov, and, michael, harris, bond, found, that, a, gene, by, the, name, of, slc6a4, was, not, a, good, predictor, of, happiness, level, in, humans, on, the, other, hand, there, have, been, many, studies, that, have, found, genetics, to, be, a, key, part, in, predicting, and, understanding, happiness, in, humans, in, a, review, article, discussing, many, studies, on, genetics, and, happiness, they, discussed, the, common, findings, the, author, found, an, important, factor, that, has, affected, scientist, findings, this, being, how, happiness, is, measured, for, example, in, certain, studies, when, subjective, wellbeing, is, measured, as, a, trait, heredity, is, found, to, be, higher, about, 70, to, 90, percent, in, another, study, 11, 500, unrelated, genotypes, were, studied, and, the, conclusion, was, the, heritability, was, only, 12, to, 18, percent, overall, this, article, found, the, common, percent, of, heredity, was, about, 20, to, 50, percent, theories, on, how, to, achieve, happiness, include, encountering, unexpected, positive, events, seeing, a, significant, other, and, basking, in, the, acceptance, and, praise, of, others, some, others, believe, that, happiness, is, not, solely, derived, from, external, momentary, pleasures, research, on, positive, psychology, well, being, eudaimonia, and, happiness, and, the, theories, of, diener, ryff, keyes, and, seligmann, covers, a, broad, range, of, levels, and, topics, including, the, biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and, global, dimensions, of, life, the, psychiatrist, george, vaillant, and, the, director, of, longitudinal, study, of, adult, development, at, harvard, university, robert, j, waldinger, found, that, those, who, were, happiest, and, healthier, reported, strong, interpersonal, relationships, research, showed, that, adequate, sleep, contributes, to, well, being, good, mental, health, and, good, relationships, contribute, more, to, happiness, than, income, does, in, 2018, laurie, r, santos, course, titled, psychology, and, the, good, life, became, the, most, popular, course, in, the, history, of, yale, university, and, was, made, available, for, free, online, to, non, yale, students, some, commentators, focus, on, the, difference, between, the, hedonistic, tradition, of, seeking, pleasant, and, avoiding, unpleasant, experiences, and, the, eudaimonic, tradition, of, living, life, in, a, full, and, deeply, satisfying, way, kahneman, has, said, that, when, you, look, at, what, people, want, for, themselves, how, they, pursue, their, goals, they, seem, more, driven, by, the, search, for, satisfaction, than, the, search, for, happiness, viktor, frankl, a, psychiatrist, and, prisoner, in, the, nazi, concentration, camps, during, world, war, ii, noticed, that, those, who, lost, hope, soon, died, while, those, who, held, to, meaning, and, purpose, tended, to, live, on, frankl, observed, that, joy, and, misery, had, more, to, do, with, a, person, s, perspective, and, choice, than, with, their, surroundings, three, key, sources, of, meaning, that, he, highlights, in, his, writings, include, the, following, psychologist, robert, emmons, has, identified, the, centrality, of, goals, in, pursuing, happiness, he, found, that, when, humans, pursue, meaningful, projects, and, activities, without, primarily, focusing, on, happiness, happiness, often, results, as, a, by, product, indicators, of, meaningfulness, predict, positive, effects, on, life, while, lack, of, meaning, predicts, negative, states, such, as, psychological, distress, emmons, summarizes, the, four, categories, of, meaning, which, have, appeared, throughout, various, studies, he, proposes, to, call, them, wist, or, work, intimacy, spirituality, and, transcendence, throughout, life, one, s, views, of, happiness, and, what, brings, happiness, can, evolve, in, early, and, emerging, adulthood, many, people, focus, on, seeking, happiness, through, friends, objects, and, money, middle, aged, adults, generally, transition, from, searching, for, object, based, happiness, to, looking, for, happiness, in, money, and, relationships, in, older, adulthood, people, tend, to, focus, more, on, personal, peace, and, lasting, relationships, ex, children, spouse, grandchildren, antti, kauppinen, a, swedish, philosopher, and, phenomenological, researcher, posited, that, the, perception, of, time, affects, the, change, in, focus, throughout, life, in, early, adulthood, most, view, life, optimistically, looking, to, the, future, and, seeing, an, entire, life, ahead, of, them, those, that, fall, into, the, middle, life, see, that, life, has, passed, behind, them, as, well, as, seeing, more, life, ahead, those, in, older, adulthood, often, see, their, lives, as, behind, them, this, shift, in, perspective, causes, a, shift, in, the, pursuit, of, happiness, from, more, tactile, object, based, happiness, to, social, and, relational, based, happiness, maslow, s, hierarchy, of, needs, is, a, pyramid, depicting, the, levels, of, human, needs, psychological, and, physical, when, a, human, being, ascends, the, steps, of, the, pyramid, self, actualization, is, reached, beyond, the, routine, of, needs, fulfillment, maslow, envisioned, moments, of, extraordinary, experience, known, as, peak, experiences, profound, moments, of, love, understanding, happiness, or, rapture, during, which, a, person, feels, more, whole, alive, self, sufficient, and, yet, a, part, of, the, world, this, is, similar, to, the, flow, concept, of, mih, ly, cs, kszentmih, lyi, the, concept, of, flow, is, the, idea, that, after, our, basic, needs, are, met, we, can, achieve, greater, happiness, by, altering, our, consciousness, by, becoming, so, engaged, in, a, task, that, we, lose, our, sense, of, time, our, intense, focus, causes, us, to, forget, any, other, issues, which, in, return, promotes, positive, emotions, erich, fromm, said, happiness, is, the, indication, that, man, has, found, the, answer, to, the, problem, of, human, existence, the, productive, realization, of, his, potentialities, and, thus, simultaneously, being, one, with, the, world, and, preserving, the, integrity, of, his, self, in, spending, his, energy, productively, he, increases, his, powers, he, burns, without, being, consumed, self, determination, theory, relates, intrinsic, motivation, to, three, needs, competence, autonomy, and, relatedness, competence, refers, to, an, individual, s, ability, to, be, effective, in, their, interactions, with, the, environment, autonomy, refers, to, a, person, s, flexibility, in, choice, and, decision, making, and, relatedness, is, the, need, to, establish, warm, close, personal, relationships, ronald, inglehart, has, traced, cross, national, differences, in, the, level, of, happiness, based, on, data, from, the, world, values, survey, he, finds, that, the, extent, to, which, a, society, allows, free, choice, has, a, major, impact, on, happiness, when, basic, needs, are, satisfied, the, degree, of, happiness, depends, on, economic, and, cultural, factors, that, enable, free, choice, in, how, people, live, their, lives, happiness, also, depends, on, religion, in, countries, where, free, choice, is, constrained, sigmund, freud, said, that, all, humans, strive, after, happiness, but, that, the, possibilities, of, achieving, it, are, restricted, because, we, are, so, made, that, we, can, derive, intense, enjoyment, only, from, a, contrast, and, very, little, from, the, state, of, things, the, idea, of, motivational, hedonism, is, the, theory, that, pleasure, is, the, aim, for, human, life, since, 2000, the, field, of, positive, psychology, which, focuses, on, the, study, of, happiness, and, human, flourishing, rather, than, maladjusted, behavior, or, illness, expanded, drastically, in, terms, of, scientific, publications, it, has, produced, many, different, views, on, causes, of, happiness, and, on, factors, that, correlate, with, happiness, such, as, positive, social, interactions, with, family, and, friends, these, factors, include, six, key, virtues, 1, wisdom, and, knowledge, which, includes, creativity, curiosity, love, of, learning, and, open, mindedness, 2, courage, which, includes, bravery, persistence, integrity, and, vitality, 3, humanity, which, includes, love, kindness, and, social, intelligence, 4, justice, which, includes, leadership, fairness, and, loyalty, 5, temperance, which, includes, self, regulation, prudence, forgiveness, humility, patience, and, modesty, 6, transcendence, which, includes, religious, spirituality, hope, gratitude, appreciation, of, beauty, and, excellence, and, humor, in, order, for, a, virtue, to, be, considered, a, key, strength, in, the, field, of, positive, psychology, it, must, meet, the, demands, of, 12, criteria, namely, ubiquity, cross, cultural, fulfilling, morally, valued, does, not, diminish, others, be, a, nonfelicitous, opposite, have, a, clear,

improve, happiness, a, person, s, level, of, subjective, well, being, is, determined, by, many, different, factors, and, social, influences, prove, to, be, a, strong, one, results, from, the, famous, framingham, heart, study, indicate, that, friends, three, degrees, of, separation, away, that, is, friends, of, friends, of, friends, can, affect, a, person, s, happiness, from, abstract, a, friend, who, lives, within, a, mile, about, 1, 6, km, and, who, becomes, happy, increases, the, probability, that, a, person, is, happy, by, 25, various, writers, including, camus, and, tolle, have, written, that, the, act, of, searching, or, seeking, for, happiness, is, incompatible, with, being, happy, john, stuart, mill, believed, that, for, the, great, majority, of, people, happiness, is, best, achieved, en, passant, rather, than, striving, for, it, directly, this, meant, no, self, consciousness, scrutiny, self, interrogation, dwelling, on, thinking, about, imagining, or, questioning, on, one, s, happiness, then, if, otherwise, fortunately, circumstanced, one, would, inhale, happiness, with, the, air, you, breathe, william, inge, said, that, on, the, whole, the, happiest, people, seem, to, be, those, who, have, no, particular, cause, for, being, happy, except, the, fact, that, they, are, so, orison, swett, marden, said, that, some, people, are, born, happy, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, is, a, popular, therapeutic, method, used, to, change, habits, by, changing, thoughts, and, problematic, behaviors, it, focuses, on, emotional, regulation, and, uses, a, lot, of, positive, psychology, practices, it, is, often, used, for, people, with, depression, anxiety, or, addictions, and, works, towards, how, to, lead, a, happier, life, common, processes, in, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, are, reframing, thoughts, from, problematic, thinking, patterns, by, replacing, them, with, beneficial, or, supportive, ones, roleplaying, finding, beneficial, coping, skills, and, choosing, new, activities, that, support, desired, behaviors, and, avoid, negative, behaviors, coined, by, harvard, professor, of, psychology, and, author, of, stumbling, on, happiness, daniel, gilbert, synthetic, happiness, is, the, happiness, we, make, for, ourselves, in, his, tedtalk, titled, the, surprising, science, of, happiness, gilbert, explains, that, everyone, possesses, a, psychological, immune, system, that, helps, to, regulate, our, emotional, reactions, through, research, that, he, studied, and, held, he, and, his, team, found, that, personal, happiness, is, largely, based, on, personal, perception, synthetic, happiness, as, an, idea, has, become, more, popular, as, people, attempt, to, define, happiness, as, a, journey, instead, of, a, destination, happiness, research, understands, happiness, as, life, satisfaction, or, well, being, since, it, has, proved, difficult, to, find, a, definition, of, happiness, individual, people, are, instead, asked, how, happy, they, feel, numerous, surveys, are, then, summarized, and, analyzed, using, static, methods, although, some, researchers, believe, that, the, scales, are, fundamentally, unsuitable, for, estimating, happiness, other, researchers, argue, that, the, happiness, indices, formed, on, the, basis, of, the, survey, have, a, high, statistical, correspondence, with, characteristics, that, are, generally, understood, to, indicate, a, happy, person, for, example, individuals, who, report, high, happiness, on, scales, smile, more, often, exhibit, more, social, behavior, are, more, helpful, and, are, less, likely, to, commit, suicide, for, this, reason, happiness, indices, determined, on, the, basis, of, the, survey, are, considered, reliable, by, happiness, researchers, before, recommending, strategies, it, is, crucial, to, rely, on, rigorous, large, scale, experiments, that, confirm, their, effectiveness, over, the, past, decade, there, has, been, a, significant, shift, in, what, constitutes, high, quality, evidence, in, psychology, there, were, adopted, e, g, practices, like, pre, registration, committing, to, specific, methodological, and, analytical, decisions, in, advance, and, increased, sample, sizes, to, avoid, underpowered, studies, a, meta, analysis, of, 2023, has, used, this, modern, evidence, based, approach, evaluating, evidence, for, common, happiness, boosting, strategies, the, study, aimed, to, shed, light, on, the, effectiveness, of, these, strategies, and, their, impact, on, subjective, well, being, as, a, first, step, the, authors, analyzed, numerous, media, articles, on, happiness, to, identify, the, five, most, commonly, recommended, strategies, these, were, expressing, gratitude, enhancing, sociability, exercising, practicing, mindfulness, meditation, and, increasing, exposure, to, nature, next, the, published, scientific, literature, was, searched, but, limited, to, the, above, described, high, quality, criteria, that, tested, the, effects, of, these, strategies, on, subjective, well, being, in, everyday, individuals, non, clinical, samples, only, 10, of, the, initially, retrieved, studies, met, those, rigorous, criteria, the, findings, revealed, that, unlike, so, far, suggested, by, scientific, studies, there, is, currently, still, a, lack, of, robust, scientific, evidence, to, support, some, of, the, most, frequently, suggested, happiness, strategies, among, the, five, most, common, happiness, strategies, there, was, reasonably, solid, evidence, of, positive, effects, from, a, gratitude, messages, or, lists, b, conversations, with, strangers, or, gratitude, and, sociability, that, is, establishing, and, maintaining, social, relationships, in, contrast, no, convincing, evidence, could, be, found, that, c, sports, d, mindfulness, training, or, e, walks, in, the, countryside, make, people, happier, there, is, a, wealth, of, cross, sectional, studies, on, happiness, and, physical, health, that, shows, consistent, positive, relationships, follow, up, studies, appear, to, show, that, happiness, does, not, predict, longevity, in, sick, populations, but, that, it, does, predict, longevity, among, healthy, populations, other, positive, effects, of, happiness, and, being, in, a, good, mood, that, have, been, studied, and, confirmed, are, that, happier, people, tend, to, be, more, helpful, attentive, and, generous, to, others, as, well, as, to, themselves, happy, people, also, have, been, shown, to, act, more, cooperatively, and, less, aggressively, and, be, more, likely, to, help, others, in, need, they, were, also, found, to, be, more, sociable, and, communicative, more, positive, effects, that, happiness, seems, to, evoke, are, creative, problem, solving, persisting, through, challenges, more, intrinsic, motivation, for, work, related, or, responsible, tasks, and, being, more, effective, at, using, efficient, decision, making, strategies, while, some, believe, that, success, breeds, happiness, lyubomirsky, king, and, diener, found, that, happiness, precedes, success, in, income, relationships, marriages, work, performance, and, health, low, mood, is, correlated, with, many, negative, life, outcomes, such, as, suicide, poor, health, substance, abuse, and, low, life, expectancy, by, extension, happiness, protects, from, those, negative, outcomes, june, gruber, argued, that, happiness, may, trigger, a, person, to, be, more, sensitive, more, gullible, less, successful, and, more, likely, to, undertake, high, risk, behaviours, she, also, conducted, studies, suggesting, that, seeking, happiness, can, have, negative, effects, such, as, failure, to, meet, over, high, expectations, iris, mauss, has, shown, that, the, more, people, strive, for, happiness, the, more, likely, they, will, set, up, too, high, of, standards, and, feel, disappointed, one, study, shows, that, women, who, value, happiness, more, tend, to, react, less, positively, to, happy, emotions, a, 2012, study, found, that, psychological, well, being, was, higher, for, people, who, experienced, both, positive, and, negative, emotions, jeremy, bentham, believed, that, public, policy, should, attempt, to, maximize, happiness, and, he, even, attempted, to, estimate, a, hedonic, calculus, thomas, jefferson, put, the, pursuit, of, happiness, on, the, same, level, as, life, and, liberty, in, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, presently, many, countries, and, organizations, regularly, measure, population, happiness, through, large, scale, surveys, e, g, bhutan, richer, nations, tend, to, have, higher, measures, of, happiness, than, poorer, nations, the, relationship, between, wealth, and, happiness, is, not, linear, and, the, same, gdp, increase, in, poor, countries, will, have, more, effect, on, happiness, than, in, wealthy, countries, some, political, scientists, argue, that, life, satisfaction, is, positively, related, to, the, social, democratic, model, of, a, generous, social, safety, net, pro, worker, labor, market, regulations, and, strong, labor, unions, others, argue, that, happiness, is, strongly, correlated, with, economic, freedom, preferably, within, the, context, of, a, western, mixed, economy, with, free, press, and, a, democracy, personal, happiness, can, be, affected, by, cultural, factors, hedonism, appears, to, be, more, strongly, related, to, happiness, in, more, individualistic, cultures, forcing, people, to, marry, and, stay, married, can, have, adverse, consequences, research, has, shown, that, unhappily, married, couples, suffer, 3, 25, times, the, risk, of, developing, clinical, depression, one, theory, is, that, higher, swb, in, richer, countries, is, related, to, their, more, individualistic, cultures, individualistic, cultures, may, satisfy, intrinsic, motivations, to, a, higher, degree, than, collectivistic, cultures, and, fulfilling, intrinsic, motivations, as, opposed, to, extrinsic, motivations, may, relate, to, greater, levels, of, happiness, leading, to, more, happiness, in, individualistic, cultures, cultural, views, on, happiness, have, changed, over, time, for, instance, western, concern, about, childhood, being, a, time, of, happiness, has, occurred, only, since, the, 19th, century, not, all, cultures, seek, to, maximize, happiness, and, some, cultures, are, averse, to, happiness, it, has, been, found, in, western, cultures, that, individual, happiness, is, the, most, important, some, other, cultures, have, opposite, views, and, tend, to, be, aversive, to, the, idea, of, individual, happiness, for, example, people, living, in, eastern, asian, cultures, focus, more, on, the, need, for, happiness, within, relationships, with, others, and, even, find, personal, happiness, to, be, harmful, to, fulfilling, happy, social, relationships, people, in, countries, with, high, cultural, religiosity, tend, to, relate, their, life, satisfaction, less, to, their, emotional, experiences, than, people, in, more, secular, countries, happiness, forms, a, central, theme, of, buddhist, teachings, for, ultimate, freedom, from, suffering, the, noble, eightfold, path, leads, its, practitioner, to, nirvana, a, state, of, everlasting, peace, ultimate, happiness, is, only, achieved, by, overcoming, craving, in, all, forms, more, mundane, forms, of, happiness, such, as, acquiring, wealth, and, maintaining, good, friendships, are, also, recognized, as, worthy, goals, for, lay, people, see, sukha, buddhism, also, encourages, the, generation, of, loving, kindness, and, compassion, the, desire, for, the, happiness, and, welfare, of, all, beings, in, advaita, vedanta, the, ultimate, goal, of, life, is, happiness, in, the,

is, mitzvah, gedolah, le, hiyot, besimcha, tamid, it, is, a, great, mitzvah, commandment, to, always, be, in, a, state, of, happiness, when, a, person, is, happy, they, are, much, more, capable, of, serving, god, and, going, about, their, daily, activities, than, when, depressed, or, upset, the, primary, meaning, of, happiness, in, various, european, languages, involves, good, fortune, blessing, or, a, similar, happening, the, meaning, in, greek, philosophy, refers, primarily, to, ethics, in, christianity, the, ultimate, end, of, human, existence, consists, in, felicity, latin, equivalent, to, the, greek, eudaimonia, blessed, happiness, described, by, the, 13th, century, philosopher, theologian, thomas, aquinas, as, a, beatific, vision, of, god, s, essence, in, the, next, life, according, to, augustine, of, hippo, and, thomas, aquinas, man, s, last, end, is, happiness, all, men, agree, in, desiring, the, last, end, which, is, happiness, aquinas, agreed, with, aristotle, that, happiness, cannot, be, reached, solely, through, reasoning, about, consequences, of, acts, but, also, requires, a, pursuit, of, good, causes, for, acts, such, as, habits, according, to, virtue, according, to, aquinas, happiness, consists, in, an, operation, of, the, speculative, intellect, consequently, happiness, consists, principally, in, such, an, operation, viz, in, the, contemplation, of, divine, things, and, the, last, end, cannot, consist, in, the, active, life, which, pertains, to, the, practical, intellect, so, therefore, the, last, and, perfect, happiness, which, we, await, in, the, life, to, come, consists, entirely, in, contemplation, but, imperfect, happiness, such, as, can, be, had, here, consists, first, and, principally, in, contemplation, but, secondarily, in, an, operation, of, the, practical, intellect, directing, human, actions, and, passions, human, complexities, like, reason, and, cognition, can, produce, well, being, or, happiness, but, such, form, is, limited, and, transitory, in, temporal, life, the, contemplation, of, god, the, infinitely, beautiful, is, the, supreme, delight, of, the, will, beatitudo, or, perfect, happiness, as, complete, well, being, is, to, be, attained, not, in, this, life, but, the, next, al, ghazali, 1058, 1111, the, sufi, thinker, wrote, that, the, alchemy, of, happiness, is, a, manual, of, religious, instruction, that, is, used, throughout, the, muslim, world, and, widely, practiced, today, philosophy, of, happiness, is, often, discussed, in, conjunction, with, ethics, traditional, european, societies, inherited, from, the, greeks, and, from, christianity, often, linked, happiness, with, morality, in, this, context, morality, was, the, performance, in, a, specific, role, in, a, certain, kind, of, social, life, happiness, remains, a, difficult, term, for, moral, philosophy, throughout, the, history, of, moral, philosophy, there, has, been, an, oscillation, between, attempts, to, define, morality, in, terms, of, consequences, leading, to, happiness, or, defining, it, as, nothing, to, do, with, happiness, at, all, in, psychology, connections, between, happiness, and, morality, have, been, studied, in, a, variety, of, ways, empirical, research, suggests, that, laypeople, s, judgments, of, a, person, s, happiness, in, part, depend, on, perceptions, of, that, person, s, morality, suggesting, that, judgments, of, others, happiness, involve, moral, evaluation, a, large, body, of, research, also, suggests, that, engaging, in, prosocial, behavior, can, increase, happiness, ethicists, have, made, arguments, for, how, humans, should, behave, either, individually, or, collectively, based, on, the, resulting, happiness, of, such, behavior, utilitarians, such, as, john, stuart, mill, and, jeremy, bentham, advocated, the, greatest, happiness, principle, as, a, guide, for, ethical, behavior, this, principle, states, that, actions, are, proportionately, right, or, wrong, by, how, much, happiness, or, unhappiness, they, bring, mill, defines, happiness, as, that, which, brings, about, an, intended, pleasure, and, avoids, an, unnecessary, pain, and, he, defines, unhappiness, as, the, reverse, namely, an, action, that, brings, about, pain, and, not, pleasure, he, is, quick, to, specify, that, pleasure, and, pain, are, to, be, understood, in, an, epicurean, light, referring, chiefly, to, the, higher, human, pleasures, of, increased, intellect, feelings, and, moral, sentiments, not, what, one, might, call, beastly, pleasures, of, mere, animal, appetites, critics, of, this, view, include, thomas, carlyle, ferdinand, t, nnies, and, others, within, the, german, philosophical, tradition, they, posit, that, a, greater, happiness, is, to, be, found, in, choosing, to, suffer, for, others, rather, than, allowing, others, to, suffer, for, them, declaring, this, to, be, a, form, of, satisfying, and, heroic, nobility, many, studies, have, observed, the, effects, of, volunteerism, as, a, form, of, altruism, on, happiness, and, health, and, have, consistently, found, that, those, who, exhibit, volunteerism, also, have, better, current, and, future, health, and, well, being, in, a, study, of, older, adults, those, who, volunteered, had, higher, life, satisfaction, and, will, to, live, and, less, depression, anxiety, and, somatization, volunteerism, and, helping, behavior, have, not, only, been, shown, to, improve, mental, health, but, physical, health, and, longevity, as, well, attributable, to, the, activity, and, social, integration, it, encourages, one, study, examined, the, physical, health, of, mothers, who, volunteered, over, 30, years, and, found, that, 52, of, those, who, did, not, belong, to, a, volunteer, organization, experienced, a, major, illness, while, only, 36, of, those, who, did, volunteer, experienced, one, a, study, on, adults, aged, 55, and, older, found, that, during, the, four, year, study, period, people, who, volunteered, for, two, or, more, organizations, had, a, 63, lower, likelihood, of, dying, after, controlling, for, prior, health, status, it, was, determined, that, volunteerism, accounted, for, a, 44, reduction, in, mortality, aristotle, described, eudaimonia, greek, as, the, goal, of, human, thought, and, action, eudaimonia, is, often, translated, to, mean, happiness, but, some, scholars, contend, that, human, flourishing, may, be, a, more, accurate, translation, aristotle, s, use, of, the, term, in, nicomachiean, ethics, extends, beyond, the, general, sense, of, happiness, in, the, nicomachean, ethics, written, in, 350, bce, aristotle, stated, that, happiness, also, being, well, and, doing, well, is, the, only, thing, that, humans, desire, for, their, own, sake, unlike, riches, honour, health, or, friendship, he, observed, that, men, sought, riches, or, honour, or, health, not, only, for, their, own, sake, but, also, in, order, to, be, happy, for, aristotle, the, term, eudaimonia, which, is, translated, as, happiness, or, flourishing, is, an, activity, rather, than, an, emotion, or, a, state, eudaimonia, greek, is, a, classical, greek, word, consists, of, the, word, eu, good, or, well, being, and, daim, n, spirit, or, minor, deity, used, by, extension, to, mean, one, s, lot, or, fortune, thus, understood, the, happy, life, is, the, good, life, that, is, a, life, in, which, a, person, fulfills, human, nature, in, an, excellent, way, specifically, aristotle, argued, that, the, good, life, is, the, life, of, excellent, rational, activity, he, arrived, at, this, claim, with, the, function, argument, basically, if, it, is, right, every, living, thing, has, a, function, that, which, it, uniquely, does, for, aristotle, human, function, is, to, reason, since, it, is, that, alone, which, humans, uniquely, do, and, performing, one, s, function, well, or, excellently, is, good, according, to, aristotle, the, life, of, excellent, rational, activity, is, the, happy, life, aristotle, argued, a, second, best, life, for, those, incapable, of, excellent, rational, activity, was, the, life, of, moral, virtue, the, key, question, aristotle, seeks, to, answer, is, what, is, the, ultimate, purpose, of, human, existence, a, lot, of, people, are, seeking, pleasure, health, and, a, good, reputation, it, is, true, that, those, have, a, value, but, none, of, them, can, occupy, the, place, of, the, greatest, good, for, which, humanity, aims, it, may, seem, like, all, goods, are, a, means, to, obtain, happiness, but, aristotle, said, that, happiness, is, always, an, end, in, itself, friedrich, nietzsche, critiqued, the, english, utilitarians, focus, on, attaining, the, greatest, happiness, stating, that, man, does, not, strive, for, happiness, only, the, englishman, does, nietzsche, meant, that, making, happiness, one, s, ultimate, goal, and, the, aim, of, one, s, existence, in, his, words, makes, one, contemptible, nietzsche, instead, yearned, for, a, culture, that, would, set, higher, more, difficult, goals, than, mere, happiness, he, introduced, the, quasi, dystopic, figure, of, the, last, man, as, a, kind, of, thought, experiment, against, the, utilitarians, and, happiness, seekers, these, small, last, men, who, seek, after, only, their, own, pleasure, and, health, avoiding, all, danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle, are, meant, to, seem, contemptible, to, nietzsche, s, reader, nietzsche, instead, wants, us, to, consider, the, value, of, what, is, difficult, what, can, only, be, earned, through, struggle, difficulty, pain, and, thus, to, come, to, see, the, affirmative, value, suffering, and, unhappiness, truly, play, in, creating, everything, of, great, worth, in, life, including, all, the, highest, achievements, of, human, culture, not, least, of, all, philosophy
