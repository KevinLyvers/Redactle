commissioned, officer, nco, or, a, warrant, officer, however, absent, contextual, qualification, the, term, typically, refers, only, to, a, force, s, commissioned, officers, the, more, senior, members, who, derive, their, authority, from, a, commission, from, the, head, of, state, the, proportion, of, officers, varies, greatly, commissioned, officers, typically, make, up, between, an, eighth, and, a, fifth, of, modern, armed, forces, personnel, in, 2013, officers, were, the, senior, 17, of, the, british, armed, forces, and, the, senior, 13, 7, of, the, french, armed, forces, in, 2012, officers, made, up, about, 18, of, the, german, armed, forces, and, about, 17, 2, of, the, united, states, armed, forces, historically, armed, forces, have, generally, had, much, lower, proportions, of, officers, during, the, first, world, war, fewer, than, 5, of, british, soldiers, were, officers, partly, because, world, war, one, junior, officers, suffered, high, casualty, rates, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, spanish, army, had, the, highest, proportion, of, officers, of, any, european, army, at, 12, 5, which, was, at, that, time, considered, unreasonably, high, by, many, spanish, and, foreign, observers, within, a, nation, s, armed, forces, armies, which, are, usually, larger, tend, to, have, a, lower, proportion, of, officers, but, a, higher, total, number, of, officers, while, navies, and, air, forces, have, higher, proportions, of, officers, especially, since, military, aircraft, are, flown, by, officers, and, naval, ships, and, submarines, are, commanded, by, officers, for, example, 13, 9, of, british, army, personnel, and, 22, 2, of, the, raf, personnel, were, officers, in, 2013, but, the, british, army, had, a, larger, total, number, of, officers, commissioned, officers, generally, receive, training, as, generalists, in, leadership, and, in, management, in, addition, to, training, relating, to, their, specific, military, occupational, specialty, or, function, in, the, military, many, militaries, typically, require, university, degrees, as, a, prerequisite, for, commissioning, even, when, accessing, candidates, from, the, enlisted, ranks, others, including, the, australian, defence, force, the, british, armed, forces, the, nepali, army, the, pakistan, armed, forces, paf, the, swiss, armed, forces, the, singapore, armed, forces, the, israel, defense, forces, idf, the, swedish, armed, forces, and, the, new, zealand, defence, force, are, different, in, not, requiring, a, university, degree, for, commissioning, although, a, significant, number, of, officers, in, these, countries, are, graduates, in, the, israel, defense, forces, a, university, degree, is, a, requirement, for, an, officer, to, advance, to, the, rank, of, lieutenant, colonel, and, beyond, the, idf, often, sponsors, the, studies, for, its, officers, in, the, rank, major, while, aircrew, and, naval, officers, obtain, academic, degrees, as, a, part, of, their, training, programmes, in, the, united, kingdom, there, are, three, routes, of, entry, for, british, armed, forces, officers, the, first, and, primary, route, are, those, who, receive, their, commission, directly, into, the, officer, grades, following, completion, at, their, relevant, military, academy, this, is, known, as, a, direct, entry, de, officer, scheme, in, the, second, method, individuals, may, gain, a, commission, after, first, enlisting, and, serving, in, the, junior, ranks, and, typically, reaching, one, of, the, senior, non, commissioned, officer, ranks, which, start, at, sergeant, sgt, and, above, as, what, are, known, as, service, entry, se, officers, and, are, typically, and, informally, known, as, ex, rankers, service, personnel, who, complete, this, process, at, or, above, the, age, of, 30, are, known, as, late, entry, le, officers, the, third, route, is, similar, to, the, second, in, that, candidates, convert, from, an, enlisted, rank, to, a, commission, but, these, are, only, taken, from, the, highest, ranks, of, sncos, warrant, officers, and, equivalents, this, route, typically, involves, reduced, training, requirements, in, recognition, of, existing, experience, some, examples, of, this, scheme, are, the, raf, s, commissioned, warrant, officer, cwo, course, or, the, royal, navy, s, warrant, officers, commissioning, programme, in, the,

of, responsibility, or, as, a, prerequisite, for, such, in, the, past, and, in, some, countries, today, but, to, a, lesser, extent, non, commissioned, members, were, almost, exclusively, conscripts, whereas, officers, were, volunteers, in, certain, commonwealth, nations, commissioned, officers, are, made, commissioners, of, oaths, by, virtue, of, their, office, and, can, thus, administer, oaths, or, take, affidavits, or, declarations, limited, in, certain, cases, by, rank, or, by, appointment, and, generally, limited, to, activities, or, personnel, related, to, their, employment, in, some,

appointed, by, the, secretary, of, the, service, and, then, commissioned, by, the, president, of, the, united, states, upon, promotion, to, chief, warrant, officer, in, many, other, countries, as, in, the, armed, forces, of, the, commonwealth, nations, warrant, officers, often, fill, the, role, of, very, senior, non, commissioned, officers, their, position, is, affirmed, by, warrant, from, the, bureaucracy, directing, the, force, for, example, the, position, of, regimental, sergeant, major, in, regiments, of, the, british, army, is, held, by, a, warrant, officer, appointed, by, the, british, government, in, the, u, s, military, a, warrant, officer, is, a, technically, focused, subject, matter, expert, such, as, helicopter, pilot, or, information, technology, specialist, until, 2024, there, were, no, warrant, officers, in, the, u, s, air, force, and, the, u, s, space, force, continues, to, have, no, warrant, officers, the, last, of, the, previous, cohort, of, usaf, warrant, officers, retired, in, the, 1980s, and, the, ranks, became, dormant, until, the, program, was, resurrected, in, 2024, the, ussf, has, not, established, any, warrant, officer, ranks, all, other, u, s, armed, forces, have, warrant, officers, with, warrant, accession, programs, unique, to, each, individual, service, s, needs, although, warrant, officers, normally, have, more, years, in, service, than, commissioned, officers, they, are, below, commissioned, officers, in, the, rank, hierarchy, in, certain, instances, commissioned, chief, warrant, officers, can, command, units, a, non, commissioned, officer, nco, is, an, enlisted, member, of, the, armed, forces, holding, a, position, of, some, degree, of, authority, who, has, usually, obtained, it, by, advancement, from, within, the, non, commissioned, ranks, officers, who, are, non, commissioned, usually, receive, management, and, leadership, training, but, their, function, is, to, serve, as, supervisors, within, their, area, of, trade, specialty, senior, ncos, serve, as, advisers, and, leaders, from, the, duty, section, level, to, the, highest, levels, of, the, armed, forces, establishment, while, lower, nco, grades, are, not, yet, considered, management, specialists, the, duties, of, an, nco, can, vary, greatly, in, scope, so, that, an, nco, in, one, country, may, hold, almost, no, authority, while, others, such, as, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, consider, their, ncos, to, be, the, backbone, of, the, military, due, to, carrying, out, the, orders, of, those, officers, appointed, over, them, in, most, maritime, forces, navies, and, coast, guards, the, nco, ranks, are, called, petty, officers, and, chief, petty, officers, while, enlisted, ranks, prior, to, attaining, nco, petty, officer, status, typically, known, as, seaman, airman, fireman, or, some, derivation, thereof, in, most, traditional, infantry, marine, and, air, forces, the, nco, ranks, are, known, as, corporals, and, sergeants, with, non, nco, enlisted, ranks, referred, to, as, privates, and, airmen, however, some, countries, use, the, term, commission, to, describe, the, promotion, of, enlisted, soldiers, especially, in, countries, with, mandatory, service, in, the, armed, forces, these, countries, refer, to, their, ncos, as, professional, soldiers, rather, than, as, officers, officers, in, nearly, every, country, of, the, world, are, segregated, from, the, enlisted, soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and, coast, guardsmen, in, many, facets, of, military, life, facilities,
