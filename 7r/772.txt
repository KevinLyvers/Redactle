in, psychology, a, mood, is, an, affective, state, in, contrast, to, emotions, or, feelings, moods, are, less, specific, less, intense, and, less, likely, to, be, provoked, or, instantiated, by, a, particular, stimulus, or, event, moods, are, typically, described, as, having, either, a, positive, or, negative, valence, in, other, words, people, usually, talk, about, being, in, a, good, mood, or, a, bad, mood, there, are, many, different, factors, that, influence, mood, and, these, can, lead, to, positive, or, negative, effects, on, mood, mood, also, differs, from, temperament, or, personality, traits, which, are, even, longer, lasting, nevertheless, personality, traits, such, as, optimism, and, neuroticism, predispose, certain, types, of, moods, long, term, disturbances, of, mood, such, as, clinical, depression, and, bipolar, disorder, are, considered, mood, disorders, mood, is, an, internal, subjective, state, but, it, often, can, be, inferred, from, posture, and, other, behaviors, we, can, be, sent, into, a, mood, by, an, unexpected, event, from, the, happiness, of, seeing, an, old, friend, to, the, anger, of, discovering, betrayal, by, a, partner, we, may, also, fall, into, a, mood, etymologically, the, word, mood, derives, from, the, old, english, m, d, which, denoted, military, courage, but, could, also, refer, to, a, person, s, humor, temper, or, disposition, at, a, particular, time, the, cognate, gothic, m, ds, translates, both, mood, spiritedness, and, anger, the, english, word, mood, which, means, emotional, condition, or, state, of, mind, was, originally, derived, from, the, proto, germanic, root, moda, positive, mood, can, be, caused, by, many, different, aspects, of, life, as, well, as, have, certain, effects, on, people, as, a, whole, good, mood, is, usually, considered, a, state, without, an, identified, cause, people, cannot, pinpoint, exactly, why, they, are, in, a, good, mood, people, seem, to, experience, a, positive, mood, when, they, have, a, clean, slate, have, had, a, good, night, sleep, and, feel, no, sense, of, stress, in, their, life, there, have, been, many, studies, done, on, the, effect, of, positive, emotion, on, the, cognitive, mind, and, there, is, speculation, that, positive, mood, can, affect, our, minds, in, good, or, bad, ways, generally, positive, mood, has, been, found, to, enhance, creative, problem, solving, and, flexible, yet, careful, thinking, some, studies, have, stated, that, positive, moods, let, people, think, creatively, freely, and, be, more, imaginative, positive, mood, can, also, help, individuals, in, situations, in, which, heavy, thinking, and, brainstorming, are, involved, in, one, experiment, individuals, who, were, induced, with, a, positive, mood, enhanced, performance, on, the, remote, associates, task, rat, a, cognitive, task, that, requires, creative, problem, solving, moreover, the, study, also, suggests, that, being, in, a, positive, mood, broadens, or, expands, the, breadth, of, attentional, selection, such, that, information, that, may, be, useful, to, the, task, at, hand, becomes, more, accessible, for, use, consequently, greater, accessibility, of, relevant, information, facilitates, successful, problem, solving, positive, mood, also, facilitates, resistance, to, temptations, especially, with, regard, to, unhealthy, food, choices, interpersonal, relationships, have, also, been, shown, to, have, an, effect, on, maintaining, a, positive, mood, social, activities, correlate, with, positive, mood, as, well, indicating, that, social, interactions, with, people, may, increase, an, individual, s, positive, mood, therefore, people, that, are, isolated, from, society, or, in, the, out, group, may, have, a, more, negative, mood, than, individuals, that, have, a, strong, social, circle, positive, mood, has, also, been, proven, to, show, negative, effects, on, cognition, as, well, according, to, the, article, positive, mood, is, associated, with, implicit, use, of, distraction, there, is, also, evidence, that, individuals, in, positive, moods, show, disrupted, performance, at, least, when, distracting, information, is, present, the, article, states, that, other, things, in, their, peripheral, views, can, easily, distract, people, who, are, in, good, moods, an, example, of, this, would, be, if, you, were, trying, to, study, in, the, library, considering, you, are, in, a, positive, mood, you, see, people, constantly, walking, around, or, making, small, noises, the, study, is, basically, stating, that, it, would, be, harder, for, positive, moods, to, focus, on, the, task, at, hand, in, particular, happy, people, may, be, more, sensitive, to, the, hedonic, consequences, of, message, processing, than, sad, people, thus, positive, moods, are, predicted, to, lead, to, decreased, processing, only, when, thinking, about, the, message, is, mood, threatening, in, comparison, if, message, processing, allows, a, person, to, maintain, or, enhance, a, pleasant, state, then, positive, moods, need, not, lead, to, lower, levels, of, message, scrutiny, than, negative, moods, it, is, assumed, that, initial, information, regarding, the, source, either, confirms, or, disconfirms, mood, congruent, expectations, specifically, a, positive, mood, may, lead, to, more, positive, expectations, concerning, source, trustworthiness, or, likability, than, a, negative, mood, as, a, consequence, people, in, a, positive, mood, should, be, more, surprised, when, they, encounter, an, untrustworthy, or, dislikable, source, rather, than, a, trustworthy, or, likable, source, like, positive, moods, negative, moods, have, important, implications, for, human, mental, and, physical, wellbeing, moods, are, basic, psychological, states, that, can, occur, as, a, reaction, to, an, event, or, can, surface, for, no, apparent, external, cause, since, there, is, no, intentional, object, that, causes, the, negative, mood, it, has, no, specific, start, and, stop, date, it, can, last, for, hours, days, weeks, or, longer, negative, moods, can, manipulate, how, individuals, interpret, and, translate, the, world, around, them, and, can, also, direct, their, behavior, negative, moods, can, affect, an, individual, s, judgment, and, perception, of, objects, and, events, in, a, study, done, by, niedenthal, and, setterland, 1994, research, showed, that, individuals, are, tuned, to, perceive, things, that, are, congruent, with, their, current, mood, negative, moods, mostly, low, intense, can, control, how, humans, perceive, emotion, congruent, objects, and, events, for, example, niedenthal, and, setterland, used, music, to, induce, positive, and, negative, moods, sad, music, was, used, as, a, stimulus, to, induce, negative, moods, and, participants, labeled, other, things, as, negative, this, proves, that, people, s, current, moods, tend, to, affect, their, judgments, and, perceptions, these, negative, moods, may, lead, to, problems, in, social, relationships, for, example, one, maladaptive, negative, mood, regulation, is, an, overactive, strategy, in, which, individuals, over, dramatize, their, negative, feelings, in, order, to, provoke, support, and, feedback, from, others, and, to, guarantee, their, availability, a, second, type, of, maladaptive, negative, mood, regulation, is, a, disabling, strategy, in, which, individuals, suppress, their, negative, feelings, and, distance, themselves, from, others, in, order, to, avoid, frustrations, and, anxiety, caused, by, others, unavailability, negative, moods, have, been, connected, with, depression, anxiety, aggression, poor, self, esteem, physiological, stress, and, decrease, in, sexual, arousal, in, some, individuals, there, is, evidence, that, depressed, or, anxious, mood, may, increase, sexual, interest, or, arousal, in, general, men, were, more, likely, than, women, to, report, increased, sexual, drive, during, negative, mood, states, negative, moods, are, labeled, as, nonconstructive, because, it, can, affect, a, person, s, ability, to, process, information, making, them, focus, solely, on, the, sender, of, a, message, while, people, in, positive, moods, will, pay, more, attention, to, both, the, sender, and, the, context, of, a, message, this, can, lead, to, problems, in, social, relationships, with, others, negative, moods, such, as, anxiety, often, lead, individuals, to, misinterpret, physical, symptoms, according, to, jerry, suls, a, professor, at, the, university, of, iowa, people, who, are, depressed, and, anxious, tend, to, be, in, rumination, however, although, an, individual, s, affective, states, can, influence, the, somatic, changes, these, individuals, are, not, hypochondriacs, although, negative, moods, are, generally, characterized, as, bad, not, all, negative, moods, are, necessarily, damaging, the, negative, state, relief, model, states, that, human, beings, have, an, innate, drive, to, reduce, negative, moods, people, can, reduce, their, negative, moods, by, engaging, in, any, mood, elevating, behavior, called, mood, repair, strategies, such, as, helping, behavior, as, it, is, paired, with, positive, value, such, as, smiles, and, thank, you, thus, negative, mood, increases, helpfulness, because, helping, others, can, reduce, one, s, own, bad, feelings, sleep, has, a, complex, and, as, yet, not, fully, elucidated, relationship, with, mood, most, commonly, if, a, person, is, sleep, deprived, he, she, will, become, more, irritable, angry, more, prone, to, stress, and, less, energized, throughout, the, day, studies, have, shown, that, even, partial, sleep, deprivation, has, a, significant, effect, on, mood, university, of, pennsylvania, researchers, found, that, subjects, who, were, limited, to, only, 4, 5, hours, of, sleep, a, night, for, one, week, reported, feeling, more, stressed, angry, sad, and, mentally, exhausted, when, the, subjects, resumed, normal, sleep, they, reported, a, dramatic, improvement, in, mood, generally, evening, oriented, people, as, compared, to, morning, ones, show, decreased, energy, and, pleasantness, and, heightened, tension, however, in, a, subset, of, cases, sleep, deprivation, can, paradoxically, lead, to, increased, energy, and, alertness, and, enhanced, mood, this, effect, is, most, marked, in, persons, with, an, eveningness, type, so, called, night, owls, and, people, suffering, from, depression, for, this, reason, it, has, sometimes, been, used, as, a, treatment, for, major, depressive, disorder, nature, can, also, have, a, positive, effect, on, mood, studies, have, shown, that, exposure, to, natural, environments, increases, positive, affect, and, decreases, negative, affect, meaning, that, one, s, mood, is, often, better, when, in, a, nature, setting, an, example, of, this, is, how, direct, exposure, to, sunlight, has, been, proven, to, improve, mood, and, has, been, used, to, treat, symptoms, of, depression, further, walking, outdoors, as, opposed, to, walking, indoors, made, individuals, much, happier, which, additionally, illustrates, that, nature, has, a, positive, effect, on, our, mood, while, nature, often, improves, our, mood, it, can, worsen, it, as, well, there, is, a, common, mood, disorder, called, seasonal, affective, disorder, sad, that, often, occurs, during, the, winter, months, when, there, is, less, daylight, and, it, is, colder, outside, sad, is, characterized, by, depressed, mood, increased, appetite, and, increased, sleep, this, displays, how, an, individual, s, mood, can, be, negatively, affected, by, nature, as, well, studies, have, also, shown, that, depending, on, the, season, temperature, can, regulate, mood, traditional, dietary, patterns, characterized, by, vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and, whole, grains, as, opposed, to, a, western, pattern, diet, characterized, by, processed, foods, refined, grains, sugary, products, and, beer, were, associated, with, lower, odds, for, major, depression, or, dysthymia, mood, disorder, and, for, anxiety, disorders, in, women, red, meat, is, found, to, be, protective, against, mood, and, anxiety, disorders, fruits, and, vegetables, are, associated, with, positive, mood, independent, of, demographic, or, lifestyle, factors, research, indicates, that, alcohol, and, energy, drinks, are, associated, with, mood, changes, research, studies, indicate, that, voluntary, facial, expressions, such, as, smiling, can, produce, effects, on, the, body, that, are, similar, to, those, that, result, from, the, actual, emotion, such, as, happiness, paul, ekman, and, his, colleagues, studied, facial, expressions, of, emotions, and, linked, specific, emotions, to, the, movement, of, corresponding, facial, muscles, each, basic, emotion, is, associated, with, a, distinctive, facial, expression, due, to, feedback, from, the, expression, that, contributes, to, the, emotional, feeling, ekman, found, that, these, expressions, of, emotion, are, universal, and, recognizable, across, widely, divergent, cultures, hormones, which, change, with, age, can, also, determine, what, type, of, mood, someone, is, and, how, well, they, are, able, to, regulate, their, moods, depression, chronic, stress, bipolar, disorder, etc, are, considered, mood, disorders, it, has, been, suggested, that, such, disorders, result, from, chemical, imbalances, in, the, brain, s, neurotransmitters, however, some, research, challenges, this, hypothesis, the, idea, of, social, mood, as, a, collectively, shared, state, of, mind, nofsinger, 2005, olson, 2006, is, attributed, to, robert, prechter, and, his, socionomics, the, notion, is, used, primarily, in, the, field, of, economics, investments, in, sociology, philosophy, and, psychology, crowd, behavior, is, the, formation, of, a, common, mood, directed, toward, an, object, of, attention
