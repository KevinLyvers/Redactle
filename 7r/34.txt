labour, economics, or, labor, economics, seeks, to, understand, the, functioning, and, dynamics, of, the, markets, for, wage, labour, labour, is, a, commodity, that, is, supplied, by, labourers, usually, in, exchange, for, a, wage, paid, by, demanding, firms, because, these, labourers, exist, as, parts, of, a, social, institutional, or, political, system, labour, economics, must, also, account, for, social, cultural, and, political, variables, labour, markets, or, job, markets, function, through, the, interaction, of, workers, and, employers, labour, economics, looks, at, the, suppliers, of, labour, services, workers, and, the, demanders, of, labour, services, employers, and, attempts, to, understand, the, resulting, pattern, of, wages, employment, and, income, these, patterns, exist, because, each, individual, in, the, market, is, presumed, to, make, rational, choices, based, on, the, information, that, they, know, regarding, wage, desire, to, provide, labour, and, desire, for, leisure, labour, markets, are, normally, geographically, bounded, but, the, rise, of, the, internet, has, brought, about, a, planetary, labour, market, in, some, sectors, labour, is, a, measure, of, the, work, done, by, human, beings, it, is, conventionally, contrasted, with, other, factors, of, production, such, as, land, and, capital, some, theories, focus, on, human, capital, or, entrepreneurship, which, refers, to, the, skills, that, workers, possess, and, not, necessarily, the, actual, work, that, they, produce, labour, is, unique, to, study, because, it, is, a, special, type, of, good, that, cannot, be, separated, from, the, owner, i, e, the, work, cannot, be, separated, from, the, person, who, does, it, a, labour, market, is, also, different, from, other, markets, in, that, workers, are, the, suppliers, and, firms, are, the, demanders, there, are, two, sides, to, labour, economics, labour, economics, can, generally, be, seen, as, the, application, of, microeconomic, or, macroeconomic, techniques, to, the, labour, market, microeconomic, techniques, study, the, role, of, individuals, and, individual, firms, in, the, labour, market, macroeconomic, techniques, look, at, the, interrelations, between, the, labour, market, the, goods, market, the, money, market, and, the, foreign, trade, market, it, looks, at, how, these, interactions, influence, macro, variables, such, as, employment, levels, participation, rates, aggregate, income, and, gross, domestic, product, the, labour, market, in, macroeconomic, theory, shows, that, the, supply, of, labour, exceeds, demand, which, has, been, proven, by, salary, growth, that, lags, productivity, growth, when, labour, supply, exceeds, demand, salary, faces, downward, pressure, due, to, an, employer, s, ability, to, pick, from, a, labour, pool, that, exceeds, the, jobs, pool, however, if, the, demand, for, labour, is, larger, than, the, supply, salary, increases, as, employee, have, more, bargaining, power, while, employers, have, to, compete, for, scarce, labour, the, labour, force, lf, is, defined, as, the, number, of, people, of, working, age, who, are, either, employed, or, actively, looking, for, work, unemployed, the, labour, force, participation, rate, lfpr, is, the, number, of, people, in, the, labour, force, divided, by, the, size, of, the, adult, civilian, noninstitutional, population, or, by, the, population, of, working, age, that, is, not, institutionalized, lfpr, lf, population, the, non, labour, force, includes, those, who, are, not, looking, for, work, those, who, are, institutionalized, such, as, in, prisons, or, psychiatric, wards, stay, at, home, spouses, children, not, of, working, age, and, those, serving, in, the, military, the, unemployment, level, is, defined, as, the, labour, force, minus, the, number, of, people, currently, employed, the, unemployment, rate, is, defined, as, the, level, of, unemployment, divided, by, the, labour, force, the, employment, rate, is, defined, as, the, number, of, people, currently, employed, divided, by, the, adult, population, or, by, the, population, of, working, age, in, these, statistics, self, employed, people, are, counted, as, employed, the, labour, market, has, the, ability, to, create, a, higher, derivative, efficiency, of, labour, especially, on, a, national, and, international, level, compared, to, simpler, forms, of, labour, distribution, leading, to, a, higher, financial, gdp, growth, and, output, an, efficient, labour, market, is, important, for, the, private, sector, as, it, drives, up, derivative, income, through, the, reduction, of, relative, costs, of, labour, this, presupposes, that, division, of, labour, is, used, as, a, method, to, attain, cost, efficiency, variables, like, employment, level, unemployment, level, labour, force, and, unfilled, vacancies, are, called, stock, variables, because, they, measure, a, quantity, at, a, point, in, time, they, can, be, contrasted, with, flow, variables, which, measure, a, quantity, over, a, duration, of, time, changes, in, the, labour, force, are, due, to, flow, variables, such, as, natural, population, growth, net, immigration, new, entrants, and, retirements, changes, in, unemployment, depend, on, inflows, non, employed, people, starting, to, look, for, jobs, and, employed, people, who, lose, their, jobs, that, are, looking, for, new, ones, and, outflows, people, who, find, new, employment, and, people, who, stop, looking, for, employment, when, looking, at, the, overall, macroeconomy, several, types, of, unemployment, have, been, identified, which, can, be, separated, into, two, categories, of, natural, and, unnatural, unemployment, natural, unemployment, unnatural, unemployment, aggregate, expenditure, ae, can, be, increased, according, to, keynes, by, increasing, consumption, spending, c, increasing, investment, spending, i, increasing, government, spending, g, or, increasing, the, net, of, exports, minus, imports, x, m, since, ae, c, i, g, x, m, neoclassical, economists, view, the, labour, market, as, similar, to, other, markets, in, that, the, forces, of, supply, and, demand, jointly, determine, the, price, in, this, case, the, wage, rate, and, quantity, in, this, case, the, number, of, people, employed, however, the, labour, market, differs, from, other, markets, like, the, markets, for, goods, or, the, financial, market, in, several, ways, in, particular, the, labour, market, may, act, as, a, non, clearing, market, while, according, to, neoclassical, theory, most, markets, quickly, attain, a, point, of, equilibrium, without, excess, supply, or, demand, this, may, not, be, true, of, the, labour, market, it, may, have, a, persistent, level, of, unemployment, contrasting, the, labour, market, to, other, markets, also, reveals, persistent, compensating, differentials, among, similar, workers, models, that, assume, perfect, competition, in, the, labour, market, as, discussed, below, conclude, that, workers, earn, their, marginal, product, of, labour, households, are, suppliers, of, labour, in, microeconomic, theory, people, are, assumed, to, be, rational, and, seeking, to, maximize, their, utility, function, in, the, labour, market, model, their, utility, function, expresses, trade, offs, in, preference, between, leisure, time, and, income, from, time, used, for, labour, however, they, are, constrained, by, the, hours, available, to, them, let, w, denote, the, hourly, wage, k, denote, total, hours, available, for, labour, and, leisure, l, denote, the, chosen, number, of, working, hours, denote, income, from, non, labour, sources, and, a, denote, leisure, hours, chosen, the, individual, s, problem, is, to, maximise, utility, u, which, depends, on, total, income, available, for, spending, on, consumption, and, also, depends, on, the, time, spent, in, leisure, subject, to, a, time, constraint, with, respect, to, the, choices, of, labour, time, and, leisure, time, this, is, shown, in, the, graph, below, which, illustrates, the, trade, off, between, allocating, time, to, leisure, activities, and, allocating, it, to, income, generating, activities, the, linear, constraint, indicates, that, every, additional, hour, of, leisure, undertaken, requires, the, loss, of, an, hour, of, labour, and, thus, of, the, fixed, amount, of, goods, that, that, labour, s, income, could, purchase, individuals, must, choose, how, much, time, to, allocate, to, leisure, activities, and, how, much, to, working, this, allocation, decision, is, informed, by, the, indifference, curve, labelled, ic, 1, the, curve, indicates, the, combinations, of, leisure, and, work, that, will, give, the, individual, a, specific, level, of, utility, the, point, where, the, highest, indifference, curve, is, just, tangent, to, the, constraint, line, point, a, illustrates, the, optimum, for, this, supplier, of, labour, services, if, consumption, is, measured, by, the, value, of, income, obtained, this, diagram, can, be, used, to, show, a, variety, of, interesting, effects, this, is, because, the, absolute, value, of, the, slope, of, the, budget, constraint, is, the, wage, rate, the, point, of, optimisation, point, a, reflects, the, equivalency, between, the, wage, rate, and, the, marginal, rate, of, substitution, of, leisure, for, income, the, absolute, value, of, the, slope, of, the, indifference, curve, because, the, marginal, rate, of, substitution, of, leisure, for, income, is, also, the, ratio, of, the, marginal, utility, of, leisure, mu, l, to, the, marginal, utility, of, income, mu, y, one, can, conclude, where, y, is, total, income, and, the, right, side, is, the, wage, rate, if, the, wage, rate, increases, this, individual, s, constraint, line, pivots, up, from, x, y, 1, to, x, y, 2, he, she, can, now, purchase, more, goods, and, services, his, her, utility, will, increase, from, point, a, on, ic, 1, to, point, b, on, ic, 2, to, understand, what, effect, this, might, have, on, the, decision, of, how, many, hours, to, work, one, must, look, at, the, income, effect, and, substitution, effect, the, wage, increase, shown, in, the, previous, diagram, can, be, decomposed, into, two, separate, effects, the, pure, income, effect, is, shown, as, the, movement, from, point, a, to, point, c, in, the, next, diagram, consumption, increases, from, y, a, to, y, c, and, since, the, diagram, assumes, that, leisure, is, a, normal, good, leisure, time, increases, from, x, a, to, x, c, employment, time, decreases, by, the, same, amount, as, leisure, increases, but, that, is, only, part, of, the, picture, as, the, wage, rate, rises, the, worker, will, substitute, away, from, leisure, and, into, the, provision, of, labour, that, is, will, work, more, hours, to, take, advantage, of, the, higher, wage, rate, or, in, other, words, substitute, away, from, leisure, because, of, its, higher, opportunity, cost, this, substitution, effect, is, represented, by, the, shift, from, point, c, to, point, b, the, net, impact, of, these, two, effects, is, shown, by, the, shift, from, point, a, to, point, b, the, relative, magnitude, of, the, two, effects, depends, on, the, circumstances, in, some, cases, such, as, the, one, shown, the, substitution, effect, is, greater, than, the, income, effect, in, which, case, more, time, will, be, allocated, to, working, but, in, other, cases, the, income, effect, will, be, greater, than, the, substitution, effect, in, which, case, less, time, is, allocated, to, working, the, intuition, behind, this, latter, case, is, that, the, individual, decides, that, the, higher, earnings, on, the, previous, amount, of, labour, can, be, spent, by, purchasing, more, leisure, if, the, substitution, effect, is, greater, than, the, income, effect, an, individual, s, supply, of, labour, services, will, increase, as, the, wage, rate, rises, which, is, represented, by, a, positive, slope, in, the, labour, supply, curve, as, at, point, e, in, the, adjacent, diagram, which, exhibits, a, positive, wage, elasticity, this, positive, relationship, is, increasing, until, point, f, beyond, which, the, income, effect, dominates, the, substitution, effect, and, the, individual, starts, to, reduce, the, number, of, labour, hours, he, supplies, point, g, as, wage, increases, in, other, words, the, wage, elasticity, is, now, negative, the, direction, of, the, slope, may, change, more, than, once, for, some, individuals, and, the, labour, supply, curve, is, different, for, different, individuals, other, variables, that, affect, the, labour, supply, decision, and, can, be, readily, incorporated, into, the, model, include, taxation, welfare, work, environment, and, income, as, a, signal, of, ability, or, social, contribution, a, firm, s, labour, demand, is, based, on, its, marginal, physical, product, of, labour, mpp, l, this, is, defined, as, the, additional, output, or, physical, product, that, results, from, an, increase, of, one, unit, of, labour, or, from, an, infinitesimal, increase, in, labour, see, also, production, theory, basics, labour, demand, is, a, derived, demand, that, is, hiring, labour, is, not, desired, for, its, own, sake, but, rather, because, it, aids, in, producing, output, which, contributes, to, an, employer, s, revenue, and, hence, profits, the, demand, for, an, additional, amount, of, labour, depends, on, the, marginal, revenue, product, mrp, and, the, marginal, cost, mc, of, the, worker, with, a, perfectly, competitive, goods, market, the, mrp, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, price, of, the, end, product, or, service, by, the, marginal, physical, product, of, the, worker, if, the, mrp, is, greater, than, a, firm, s, marginal, cost, then, the, firm, will, employ, the, worker, since, doing, so, will, increase, profit, the, firm, only, employs, however, up, to, the, point, where, mrp, mc, and, not, beyond, in, neoclassical, economic, theory, the, mrp, of, the, worker, is, affected, by, other, inputs, to, production, with, which, the, worker, can, work, e, g, machinery, often, aggregated, under, the, term, capital, it, is, typical, in, economic, models, for, greater, availability, of, capital, for, a, firm, to, increase, the, mrp, of, the, worker, all, else, equal, education, and, training, are, counted, as, human, capital, since, the, amount, of, physical, capital, affects, mrp, and, since, financial, capital, flows, can, affect, the, amount, of, physical, capital, available, mrp, and, thus, wages, can, be, affected, by, financial, capital, flows, within, and, between, countries, and, the, degree, of, capital, mobility, within, and, between, countries, according, to, neoclassical, theory, over, the, relevant, range, of, outputs, the, marginal, physical, product, of, labour, is, declining, law, of, diminishing, returns, that, is, as, more, and, more, units, of, labour, are, employed, their, additional, output, begins, to, decline, additionally, although, the, mrp, is, a, good, way, of, expressing, an, employer, s, demand, other, factors, such, as, social, group, formation, can, the, demand, as, well, as, the, labour, supply, this, constantly, restructures, exactly, what, a, labour, market, is, and, leads, way, to, cause, problems, for, theories, of, inflation, the, marginal, revenue, product, of, labour, can, be, used, as, the, demand, for, labour, curve, for, this, firm, in, the, short, run, in, competitive, markets, a, firm, faces, a, perfectly, elastic, supply, of, labour, which, corresponds, with, the, wage, rate, and, the, marginal, resource, cost, of, labour, w, s, l, mfc, l, in, imperfect, markets, the, diagram, would, have, to, be, adjusted, because, mfc, l, would, then, be, equal, to, the, wage, rate, divided, by, marginal, costs, because, optimum, resource, allocation, requires, that, marginal, factor, costs, equal, marginal, revenue, product, this, firm, would, demand, l, units, of, labour, as, shown, in, the, diagram, the, demand, for, labour, of, this, firm, can, be, summed, with, the, demand, for, labour, of, all, other, firms, in, the, economy, to, obtain, the, aggregate, demand, for, labour, likewise, the, supply, curves, of, all, the, individual, workers, mentioned, above, can, be, summed, to, obtain, the, aggregate, supply, of, labour, these, supply, and, demand, curves, can, be, analysed, in, the, same, way, as, any, other, industry, demand, and, supply, curves, to, determine, equilibrium, wage, and, employment, levels, wage, differences, exist, particularly, in, mixed, and, fully, partly, flexible, labour, markets, for, example, the, wages, of, a, doctor, and, a, port, cleaner, both, employed, by, the, nhs, differ, greatly, there, are, various, factors, concerning, this, phenomenon, this, includes, the, mrp, of, the, worker, a, doctor, s, mrp, is, far, greater, than, that, of, the, port, cleaner, in, addition, the, barriers, to, becoming, a, doctor, are, far, greater, than, that, of, becoming, a, port, cleaner, to, become, a, doctor, takes, a, lot, of, education, and, training, which, is, costly, and, only, those, who, excel, in, academia, can, succeed, in, becoming, doctors, the, port, cleaner, however, requires, relatively, less, training, the, supply, of, doctors, is, therefore, significantly, less, elastic, than, that, of, port, cleaners, demand, is, also, inelastic, as, there, is, a, high, demand, for, doctors, and, medical, care, is, a, necessity, so, the, nhs, will, pay, higher, wage, rates, to, attract, the, profession, some, labour, markets, have, a, single, employer, and, thus, do, not, satisfy, the, perfect, competition, assumption, of, the, neoclassical, model, above, the, model, of, a, monopsonistic, labour, market, gives, a, lower, quantity, of, employment, and, a, lower, equilibrium, wage, rate, than, does, the, competitive, model, in, many, real, life, situations, the, assumption, of, perfect, information, is, unrealistic, an, employer, does, not, necessarily, know, how, hard, workers, are, working, or, how, productive, they, are, this, provides, an, incentive, for, workers, to, shirk, from, providing, their, full, effort, called, moral, hazard, since, it, is, difficult, for, the, employer, to, identify, the, hard, working, and, the, shirking, employees, there, is, no, incentive, to, work, hard, and, productivity, falls, overall, leading, to, the, hiring, of, more, workers, and, a, lower, unemployment, rate, one, solution, that, is, used, to, avoid, a, moral, hazard, is, stock, options, that, grant, employees, the, chance, to, benefit, directly, from, a, firm, s, success, however, this, solution, has, attracted, criticism, as, executives, with, large, stock, option, packages, have, been, suspected, of, acting, to, over, inflate, share, values, to, the, detriment, of, the, long, run, welfare, of, the, firm, another, solution, foreshadowed, by, the, rise, of, temporary, workers, in, japan, and, the, firing, of, many, of, these, workers, in, response, to, the, financial, crisis, of, 2008, is, more, flexible, job, contracts, and, terms, that, encourage, employees, to, work, less, than, full, time, by, partially, compensating, for, the, loss, of, hours, relying, on, workers, to, adapt, their, working, time, in, response, to, job, requirements, and, economic, conditions, instead, of, the, employer, trying, to, determine, how, much, work, is, needed, to, complete, a, given, task, and, overestimating, another, aspect, of, uncertainty, results, from, the, firm, s, imperfect, knowledge, about, worker, ability, if, a, firm, is, unsure, about, a, worker, s, ability, it, pays, a, wage, assuming, that, the, worker, s, ability, is, the, average, of, similar, workers, this, wage, under, compensates, high, ability, workers, which, may, drive, them, away, from, the, labour, market, as, well, as, at, the, same, time, attracting, low, ability, workers, such, a, phenomenon, called, adverse, selection, can, sometimes, lead, to, market, collapse, one, way, to, combat, adverse, selection, firms, will, try, to, use, signalling, pioneered, by, michael, spence, whereby, employers, could, use, various, characteristics, of, applicants, differentiate, between, high, ability, or, low, ability, workers, one, common, signal, used, is, education, whereby, employers, assume, that, high, ability, workers, will, have, higher, levels, of, education, employers, can, then, compensate, high, ability, workers, with, higher, wages, however, signalling, does, not, always, work, and, it, may, appear, to, an, external, observer, that, education, has, raised, the, marginal, product, of, labour, without, this, necessarily, being, true, one, of, the, major, research, achievements, of, the, 1990, 2010, period, was, the, development, of, a, framework, with, dynamic, search, matching, and, bargaining, at, the, micro, level, one, sub, discipline, eliciting, increased, attention, in, recent, decades, is, analysis, of, internal, labour, markets, that, is, within, firms, or, other, organisations, studied, in, personnel, economics, from, the, perspective, of, personnel, management, by, contrast, external, labour, markets, imply, that, workers, move, somewhat, fluidly, between, firms, and, wages, are, determined, by, some, aggregate, process, where, firms, do, not, have, significant, discretion, over, wage, setting, the, focus, is, on, how, firms, establish, maintain, and, end, employment, relationships, and, on, how, firms, provide, incentives, to, employees, including, models, and, empirical, work, on, incentive, systems, and, as, constrained, by, economic, efficiency, and, risk, incentive, tradeoffs, relating, to, personnel, compensation, inequality, and, discrimination, in, the, workplace, can, have, many, effects, on, workers, in, the, context, of, labour, economics, inequality, is, usually, referring, to, the, unequal, distribution, of, earning, between, households, inequality, is, commonly, measured, by, economists, using, the, gini, coefficient, this, coefficient, does, not, have, a, concrete, meaning, but, is, more, used, as, a, way, to, compare, inequality, across, regions, the, higher, the, gini, coefficient, is, calculated, to, be, the, larger, inequality, exists, in, a, region, over, time, inequality, has, on, average, been, increasing, this, is, due, to, numerous, factors, including, labour, supply, and, demand, shifts, as, well, as, institutional, changes, in, the, labour, market, on, the, shifts, in, labour, supply, and, demand, factors, include, demand, for, skilled, workers, going, up, more, than, the, supply, of, skilled, workers, and, relative, to, unskilled, workers, as, well, as, technological, changes, that, increase, productivity, all, of, these, things, cause, wages, to, go, up, for, skilled, labour, while, unskilled, worker, wages, stay, the, same, or, decline, as, for, the, institutional, changes, a, decrease, in, union, power, and, a, declining, real, minimum, wage, which, both, reduce, unskilled, workers, wages, and, tax, cuts, for, the, wealthy, all, increase, the, inequality, gap, between, groups, of, earners, as, for, discrimination, it, is, the, difference, in, pay, that, can, be, attributed, to, the, demographic, differences, between, people, such, as, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual, orientation, etc, even, though, these, factors, do, not, affect, the, productivity, of, the, worker, many, regions, and, countries, have, enacted, government, policies, to, combat, discrimination, including, discrimination, in, the, workplace, discrimination, can, be, modelled, and, measured, in, numerous, ways, the, oaxaca, decomposition, is, a, common, method, used, to, calculate, the, amount, of, discrimination, that, exists, when, wages, differ, between, groups, of, people, this, decomposition, aims, to, calculate, the, difference, in, wages, that, occurs, because, of, differences, in, skills, versus, the, returns, to, those, skills, a, way, of, modelling, discrimination, in, the, workplace, when, dealing, with, wages, are, gary, becker, s, taste, models, using, taste, models, employer, discrimination, can, be, thought, of, as, the, employer, not, hiring, the, minority, worker, because, of, their, perceived, cost, of, hiring, that, worker, is, higher, than, that, of, the, cost, of, hiring, a, non, minority, worker, which, causes, less, hiring, of, the, minority, another, taste, model, is, for, employee, discrimination, which, does, not, cause, a, decline, in, the, hiring, of, minorities, but, instead, causes, a, more, segregated, workforce, because, the, prejudiced, worker, feels, that, they, should, be, paid, more, to, work, next, to, the, worker, they, are, prejudiced, against, or, that, they, are, not, paid, an, equal, amount, as, the, worker, they, are, prejudiced, against, one, more, taste, model, involves, customer, discrimination, whereby, the, employers, themselves, are, not, prejudiced, but, believe, that, their, customers, might, be, so, therefore, the, employer, is, less, likely, to, hire, the, minority, worker, if, they, are, going, to, interact, with, customers, that, are, prejudiced, there, are, many, other, taste, models, other, than, these, that, gary, becker, has, made, to, explain, discrimination, that, causes, differences, in, hiring, in, wages, in, the, labour, market, many, sociologists, political, economists, and, heterodox, economists, claim, that, labour, economics, tends, to, lose, sight, of, the, complexity, of, individual, employment, decisions, these, decisions, particularly, on, the, supply, side, are, often, loaded, with, considerable, emotional, baggage, and, a, purely, numerical, analysis, can, miss, important, dimensions, of, the, process, such, as, social, benefits, of, a, high, income, or, wage, rate, regardless, of, the, marginal, utility, from, increased, consumption, or, specific, economic, goals, from, the, perspective, of, mainstream, economics, neoclassical, models, are, not, meant, to, serve, as, a, full, description, of, the, psychological, and, subjective, factors, that, go, into, a, given, individual, s, employment, relations, but, as, a, useful, approximation, of, human, behaviour, in, the, aggregate, which, can, be, fleshed, out, further, by, the, use, of, concepts, such, as, information, asymmetry, transaction, costs, contract, theory, etc, also, missing, from, most, labour, market, analyses, is, the, role, of, unpaid, labour, such, as, unpaid, internships, where, workers, with, little, or, no, experience, are, allowed, to, work, a, job, without, pay, so, that, they, can, gain, experience, in, a, particular, profession, even, though, this, type, of, labour, is, unpaid, it, can, nevertheless, play, an, important, part, in, society, if, not, abused, by, employers, the, most, dramatic, example, is, child, raising, however, over, the, past, 25, years, an, increasing, literature, usually, designated, as, the, economics, of, the, family, has, sought, to, study, within, household, decision, making, including, joint, labour, supply, fertility, child,
