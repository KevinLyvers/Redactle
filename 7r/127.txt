standard, oil, company, ohio, which, had, been, founded, in, 1870, by, john, d, rockefeller, the, trust, was, born, on, january, 2, 1882, when, a, group, of, 41, investors, signed, the, standard, oil, trust, agreement, which, pooled, their, securities, of, 40, companies, into, a, single, holding, agency, managed, by, nine, trustees, the, original, trust, was, valued, at, 70, million, on, march, 21, 1892, the, standard, oil, trust, was, dissolved, and, its, holdings, were, reorganized, into, 20, independent, companies, that, formed, an, unofficial, union, referred, to, as, standard, oil, interests, in, 1899, the, standard, oil, company, new, jersey, acquired, the, shares, of, the, other, 19, companies, and, became, the, holding, company, for, the, trust, jersey, standard, operated, a, near, monopoly, in, the, american, oil, industry, from, 1899, until, 1911, and, was, the, largest, corporation, in, the, united, states, in, 1911, the, landmark, supreme, court, case, standard, oil, co, of, new, jersey, v, united, states, found, jersey, standard, guilty, of, anticompetitive, practices, and, ordered, it, to, break, up, its, holdings, the, charge, against, jersey, came, about, in, part, as, a, consequence, of, the, reporting, of, ida, tarbell, who, wrote, the, history, of, the, standard, oil, company, the, net, value, of, companies, severed, from, jersey, standard, in, 1911, was, 375, million, which, constituted, 57, per, cent, of, jersey, s, value, after, the, dissolution, jersey, standard, became, america, s, second, largest, corporation, after, united, states, steel, the, standard, oil, company, new, jersey, which, was, renamed, exxon, in, 1973, and, exxonmobil, in, 1999, remains, the, largest, public, oil, company, in, the, world, many, of, the, companies, disassociated, from, jersey, standard, in, 1911, remained, powerful, businesses, through, the, twentieth, century, these, included, the, standard, oil, company, of, new, york, standard, oil, company, indiana, standard, oil, company, california, ohio, oil, company, continental, oil, company, and, atlantic, refining, company, standard, oil, s, prehistory, began, in, 1863, as, an, ohio, partnership, formed, by, industrialist, john, d, rockefeller, his, brother, william, rockefeller, henry, flagler, chemist, samuel, andrews, silent, partner, stephen, v, harkness, and, oliver, burr, jennings, who, had, married, the, sister, of, william, rockefeller, s, wife, in, 1870, rockefeller, abolished, the, partnership, and, incorporated, standard, oil, in, ohio, of, the, initial, 10, 000, shares, john, d, rockefeller, received, 2, 667, harkness, received, 1, 334, william, rockefeller, flagler, and, andrews, received, 1, 333, each, jennings, received, 1, 000, and, the, firm, of, rockefeller, andrews, flagler, received, 1, 000, rockefeller, chose, the, standard, oil, name, as, a, symbol, of, the, reliable, standards, of, quality, and, service, that, he, envisioned, for, the, nascent, oil, industry, in, the, early, years, john, d, rockefeller, dominated, the, combine, he, was, the, single, most, important, figure, in, shaping, the, new, oil, industry, he, quickly, distributed, power, and, the, tasks, of, policy, formation, to, a, system, of, committees, but, always, remained, the, largest, shareholder, authority, was, centralized, in, the, company, s, main, office, in, cleveland, but, decisions, in, the, office, were, made, cooperatively, the, company, grew, by, increasing, sales, and, through, acquisitions, after, purchasing, competing, firms, rockefeller, shut, down, those, he, believed, to, be, inefficient, and, kept, the, others, in, a, seminal, deal, in, 1868, the, lake, shore, railroad, a, part, of, the, new, york, central, gave, rockefeller, s, firm, a, going, rate, of, one, cent, a, gallon, or, forty, two, cents, a, barrel, an, effective, 71, discount, from, its, listed, rates, in, return, for, a, promise, to, ship, at, least, 60, carloads, of, oil, daily, and, to, handle, loading, and, unloading, on, its, own, smaller, companies, decried, such, deals, as, unfair, because, they, were, not, producing, enough, oil, to, qualify, for, discounts, standard, s, actions, and, secret, transport, deals, helped, its, kerosene, price, to, drop, from, 58, to, 26, cents, from, 1865, to, 1870, rockefeller, used, the, erie, canal, as, a, cheap, alternative, form, of, transportation, in, the, summer, months, when, it, was, not, frozen, to, ship, his, refined, oil, from, cleveland, to, the, industrialized, northeast, in, the, winter, months, his, only, options, were, the, three, trunk, lines, the, erie, railroad, and, the, new, york, central, railroad, to, new, york, city, and, the, pennsylvania, railroad, to, pittsburgh, and, philadelphia, competitors, disliked, the, company, s, business, practices, but, consumers, liked, the, lower, prices, standard, oil, being, formed, well, before, the, discovery, of, the, spindletop, oil, field, in, texas, far, from, standard, oil, s, base, in, the, midwest, and, a, demand, for, oil, other, than, for, heat, and, light, was, well, placed, to, control, the, growth, of, the, oil, business, the, company, was, perceived, to, own, and, control, all, aspects, of, the, trade, in, 1872, rockefeller, joined, the, south, improvement, co, which, would, have, allowed, him, to, receive, rebates, for, shipping, and, drawbacks, on, oil, his, competitors, shipped, but, when, this, deal, became, known, competitors, convinced, the, pennsylvania, legislature, to, revoke, south, improvement, s, charter, no, oil, was, ever, shipped, under, this, arrangement, using, highly, effective, tactics, later, widely, criticized, it, absorbed, or, destroyed, most, of, its, competition, in, cleveland, in, less, than, two, months, and, later, throughout, the, northeastern, united, states, a, barton, hepburn, was, directed, by, the, new, york, state, legislature, in, 1879, to, investigate, the, railroads, practice, of, giving, rebates, to, their, largest, clients, within, the, state, merchants, without, ties, to, the, oil, industry, had, pressed, for, the, hearings, prior, to, the, committee, s, investigation, few, knew, of, the, size, of, standard, oil, s, control, and, influence, on, seemingly, unaffiliated, oil, refineries, and, pipelines, hawke, 1980, cites, that, only, a, dozen, or, so, within, standard, oil, knew, the, extent, of, company, operations, the, committee, counsel, simon, sterne, questioned, representatives, from, the, erie, railroad, and, the, new, york, central, railroad, and, discovered, that, at, least, half, of, their, long, haul, traffic, granted, rebates, and, much, of, this, traffic, came, from, standard, oil, the, committee, then, shifted, focus, to, standard, oil, s, operations, john, dustin, archbold, as, president, of, acme, oil, company, denied, that, acme, was, associated, with, standard, oil, he, then, admitted, to, being, a, director, of, standard, oil, the, committee, s, final, report, scolded, the, railroads, for, their, rebate, policies, and, cited, standard, oil, as, an, example, this, scolding, was, largely, moot, to, standard, oil, s, interests, since, long, distance, oil, pipelines, were, now, their, preferred, method, of, transportation, in, response, to, state, laws, that, had, the, result, of, limiting, the, scale, of, companies, rockefeller, and, his, associates, developed, innovative, ways, of, organizing, to, effectively, manage, their, fast, growing, enterprise, on, january, 2, 1882, they, combined, their, disparate, companies, spread, across, dozens, of, states, under, a, single, group, of, trustees, by, a, secret, agreement, the, existing, 37, stockholders, conveyed, their, shares, in, trust, to, nine, trustees, john, and, william, rockefeller, oliver, h, payne, charles, pratt, henry, flagler, john, d, archbold, william, g, warden, jabez, bostwick, and, benjamin, brewster, whereas, some, state, legislatures, imposed, special, taxes, on, out, of, state, corporations, doing, business, in, their, states, other, legislatures, forbade, corporations, in, their, state, from, holding, the, stock, of, companies, based, elsewhere, legislators, established, such, restrictions, in, the, hope, that, they, would, force, successful, companies, to, incorporate, and, thus, pay, taxes, in, their, state, standard, oil, s, organizational, concept, proved, so, successful, that, other, giant, enterprises, adopted, this, trust, form, by, 1882, rockefeller, s, top, aide, was, john, dustin, archbold, whom, he, left, in, control, after, disengaging, from, business, to, concentrate, on, philanthropy, after, 1896, other, notable, principals, of, the, company, include, henry, flagler, developer, of, the, florida, east, coast, railway, and, resort, cities, and, henry, h, rogers, who, built, the, virginian, railway, in, 1885, standard, oil, of, ohio, moved, its, headquarters, from, cleveland, to, its, permanent, headquarters, at, 26, broadway, in, new, york, city, concurrently, the, trustees, of, standard, oil, of, ohio, chartered, the, standard, oil, co, of, new, jersey, socnj, to, take, advantage, of, new, jersey, s, more, lenient, corporate, stock, ownership, laws, in, 1890, congress, overwhelmingly, passed, the, sherman, antitrust, act, senate, 51, 1, house, 242, 0, a, source, of, american, anti, monopoly, laws, the, law, forbade, every, contract, scheme, deal, or, conspiracy, to, restrain, trade, though, the, phrase, restraint, of, trade, remained, subjective, the, standard, oil, group, quickly, attracted, attention, from, antitrust, authorities, leading, to, a, lawsuit, filed, by, ohio, attorney, general, david, k, watson, from, 1882, to, 1906, standard, paid, out, 548, 436, 000, equivalent, to, 13, 941, 200, 000, in, 2023, in, dividends, at, a, 65, 4, payout, ratio, the, total, net, earnings, from, 1882, to, 1906, amounted, to, 838, 783, 800, equivalent, to, 21, 321, 800, 000, in, 2023, exceeding, the, dividends, by, 290, 347, 800, which, was, used, for, plant, expansions, in, 1896, john, rockefeller, retired, from, the, standard, oil, co, of, new, jersey, the, holding, company, of, the, group, but, remained, president, and, a, major, shareholder, vice, president, john, dustin, archbold, took, a, large, part, in, the, running, of, the, firm, in, the, year, 1904, standard, oil, controlled, 91, of, oil, refinement, and, 85, of, final, sales, in, the, united, states, at, this, time, state, and, federal, laws, sought, to, counter, this, development, with, antitrust, laws, in, 1911, the, u, s, justice, department, sued, the, group, under, the, federal, antitrust, law, and, ordered, its, breakup, into, 39, companies, standard, oil, s, market, position, was, initially, established, through, an, emphasis, on, efficiency, and, responsibility, while, most, companies, dumped, gasoline, in, rivers, this, was, before, the, automobile, was, popular, standard, used, it, to, fuel, its, machines, while, other, companies, refineries, piled, mountains, of, heavy, waste, rockefeller, found, ways, to, sell, it, for, example, standard, bought, the, company, that, invented, and, produced, vaseline, the, chesebrough, manufacturing, co, which, was, a, standard, company, only, from, 1908, until, 1911, one, of, the, original, muckrakers, ida, m, tarbell, was, an, american, author, and, journalist, whose, father, was, an, oil, producer, whose, business, had, failed, because, of, rockefeller, s, business, dealings, after, extensive, interviews, with, a, sympathetic, senior, executive, of, standard, oil, henry, h, rogers, tarbell, s, investigations, of, standard, oil, fueled, growing, public, attacks, on, standard, oil, and, monopolies, in, general, her, work, was, published, in, 19, parts, in, mcclure, s, magazine, from, november, 1902, to, october, 1904, then, in, 1904, as, the, book, the, history, of, the, standard, oil, co, the, standard, oil, trust, was, controlled, by, a, small, group, of, families, rockefeller, stated, in, 1910, i, think, it, is, true, that, the, pratt, family, the, payne, whitney, family, which, were, one, as, all, the, stock, came, from, colonel, payne, the, harkness, flagler, family, which, came, into, the, company, together, and, the, rockefeller, family, controlled, a, majority, of, the, stock, during, all, the, history, of, the, company, up, to, the, present, time, these, families, reinvested, most, of, the, dividends, in, other, industries, especially, railroads, they, also, invested, heavily, in, the, gas, and, the, electric, lighting, business, including, the, giant, consolidated, gas, co, of, new, york, city, they, made, large, purchases, of, stock, in, u, s, steel, amalgamated, copper, and, even, corn, products, refining, co, weetman, pearson, a, british, petroleum, entrepreneur, in, mexico, began, negotiating, with, standard, oil, in, 1912, 13, to, sell, his, el, aguila, oil, company, since, pearson, was, no, longer, bound, to, promises, to, the, porfirio, d, az, regime, 1876, 1911, to, not, to, sell, to, u, s, interests, however, the, deal, fell, through, and, the, firm, was, sold, to, royal, dutch, shell, standard, oil, s, production, increased, so, rapidly, it, soon, exceeded, u, s, demand, and, the, company, began, viewing, export, markets, in, the, 1890s, standard, oil, began, marketing, kerosene, to, china, s, large, population, of, close, to, 400, million, as, lamp, fuel, for, its, chinese, trademark, and, brand, standard, oil, adopted, the, name, mei, foo, chinese, as, a, transliteration, mei, foo, also, became, the, name, of, the, tin, lamp, that, standard, oil, produced, and, gave, away, or, sold, cheaply, to, chinese, farmers, encouraging, them, to, switch, from, vegetable, oil, to, kerosene, the, response, was, positive, sales, boomed, and, china, became, standard, oil, s, largest, market, in, asia, prior, to, pearl, harbor, stanvac, was, the, largest, single, u, s, investment, in, southeast, asia, the, north, china, department, of, socony, standard, oil, company, of, new, york, operated, a, subsidiary, called, socony, river, and, coastal, fleet, north, coast, division, which, became, the, north, china, division, of, stanvac, standard, vacuum, oil, company, after, that, company, was, formed, in, 1933, to, distribute, its, products, standard, oil, constructed, storage, tanks, canneries, bulk, oil, from, large, ocean, tankers, was, re, packaged, into, 5, us, gallon, 19, l, 4, 2, imp, gal, tins, warehouses, and, offices, in, key, chinese, cities, for, inland, distribution, the, company, had, motor, tank, trucks, and, railway, tank, cars, and, for, river, navigation, it, had, a, fleet, of, low, draft, steamers, and, other, vessels, stanvac, s, north, china, division, based, in, shanghai, owned, hundreds, of, vessels, including, motor, barges, steamers, launches, tugboats, and, tankers, up, to, 13, tankers, operated, on, the, yangtze, river, the, largest, of, which, were, mei, ping, 1, 118, gross, register, tons, grt, mei, hsia, 1, 048, grt, and, mei, an, 934, grt, all, three, were, destroyed, in, the, 1937, uss, panay, incident, mei, an, was, launched, in, 1901, and, was, the, first, vessel, in, the, fleet, other, vessels, included, mei, chuen, mei, foo, mei, hung, mei, kiang, mei, lu, mei, tan, mei, su, mei, hsia, mei, ying, and, mei, yun, mei, hsia, a, tanker, was, specially, designed, for, river, duty, it, was, built, by, new, engineering, and, shipbuilding, works, of, shanghai, who, also, built, the, 500, ton, launch, mei, foo, in, 1912, mei, hsia, beautiful, gorges, was, launched, in, 1926, and, carried, 350, tons, of, bulk, oil, in, three, holds, plus, a, forward, cargo, hold, and, space, between, decks, for, carrying, general, cargo, or, packed, oil, she, had, a, length, of, 206, feet, 63, m, a, beam, of, 32, feet, 9, 8, m, a, depth, of, 10, feet, 6, inches, 3, 2, m, and, had, a, bulletproof, wheelhouse, mei, ping, beautiful, tranquility, launched, in, 1927, was, designed, off, shore, but, assembled, and, finished, in, shanghai, its, oil, fuel, burners, came, from, the, u, s, and, water, tube, boilers, came, from, england, standard, oil, company, and, socony, vacuum, oil, company, became, partners, in, providing, markets, for, the, oil, reserves, in, the, middle, east, in, 1906, socony, later, mobil, opened, its, first, fuel, terminals, in, alexandria, it, explored, in, palestine, before, the, world, war, broke, out, but, ran, into, conflict, with, the, local, authorities, by, 1890, standard, oil, controlled, 88, percent, of, the, refined, oil, flows, in, the, united, states, the, state, of, ohio, successfully, sued, standard, compelling, the, dissolution, of, the, trust, in, 1892, but, standard, simply, separated, standard, oil, of, ohio, and, kept, control, of, it, eventually, the, state, of, new, jersey, changed, its, incorporation, laws, to, allow, a, company, to, hold, shares, in, other, companies, in, any, state, so, in, 1899, the, standard, oil, trust, based, at, 26, broadway, in, new, york, was, legally, reborn, as, a, holding, company, the, standard, oil, co, of, new, jersey, socnj, which, held, stock, in, 41, other, companies, which, controlled, other, companies, which, in, turn, controlled, yet, other, companies, according, to, daniel, yergin, in, his, pulitzer, prize, winning, the, prize, the, epic, quest, for, oil, money, and, power, 1990, this, conglomerate, was, seen, by, the, public, as, all, pervasive, controlled, by, a, select, group, of, directors, and, completely, unaccountable, in, 1904, standard, controlled, 91, percent, of, production, and, 85, percent, of, final, sales, most, of, its, output, was, kerosene, of, which, 55, percent, was, exported, around, the, world, after, 1900, it, did, not, try, to, force, competitors, out, of, business, by, selling, at, a, loss, the, federal, commissioner, of, corporations, studied, standard, s, operations, from, the, period, of, 1904, to, 1906, and, concluded, that, beyond, question, the, dominant, position, of, the, standard, oil, co, in, the, refining, industry, was, due, to, unfair, practices, to, abuse, of, the, control, of, pipe, lines, to, railroad, discriminations, and, to, unfair, methods, of, competition, in, the, sale, of, the, refined, petroleum, products, because, of, competition, from, other, firms, their, market, share, gradually, eroded, to, 70, percent, by, 1906, which, was, the, year, when, the, antitrust, case, was, filed, against, standard, standard, s, market, share, was, 64, percent, by, 1911, when, standard, was, ordered, broken, up, at, least, 147, refining, companies, were, competing, with, standard, including, gulf, texaco, and, shell, it, did, not, try, to, monopolize, the, exploration, and, extraction, of, oil, its, share, in, 1911, was, 11, percent, in, 1909, the, u, s, justice, department, sued, standard, under, federal, antitrust, law, the, sherman, antitrust, act, of, 1890, for, sustaining, a, monopoly, and, restraining, interstate, commerce, by, rebates, preferences, and, other, discriminatory, practices, in, favor, of, the, combination, by, railroad, companies, restraint, and, monopolization, by, control, of, pipe, lines, and, unfair, practices, against, competing, pipe, lines, contracts, with, competitors, in, restraint, of, trade, unfair, methods, of, competition, such, as, local, price, cutting, at, the, points, where, necessary, to, suppress, competition, espionage, of, the, business, of, competitors, the, operation, of, bogus, independent, companies, and, payment, of, rebates, on, oil, with, the, like, intent, the, lawsuit, argued, that, standard, s, monopolistic, practices, had, taken, place, over, the, preceding, four, years, the, general, result, of, the, investigation, has, been, to, disclose, the, existence, of, numerous, and, flagrant, discriminations, by, the, railroads, in, behalf, of, the, standard, oil, co, and, its, affiliated, corporations, with, comparatively, few, exceptions, mainly, of, other, large, concerns, in, california, the, standard, has, been, the, sole, beneficiary, of, such, discriminations, in, almost, every, section, of, the, country, that, company, has, been, found, to, enjoy, some, unfair, advantages, over, its, competitors, and, some, of, these, discriminations, affect, enormous, areas, the, government, identified, four, illegal, patterns, 1, secret, and, semi, secret, railroad, rates, 2, discriminations, in, the, open, arrangement, of, rates, 3, discriminations, in, classification, and, rules, of, shipment, 4, discriminations, in, the, treatment, of, private, tank, cars, the, government, alleged, almost, everywhere, the, rates, from, the, shipping, points, used, exclusively, or, almost, exclusively, by, the, standard, are, relatively, lower, than, the, rates, from, the, shipping, points, of, its, competitors, rates, have, been, made, low, to, let, the, standard, into, markets, or, they, have, been, made, high, to, keep, its, competitors, out, of, markets, trifling, differences, in, distances, are, made, an, excuse, for, large, differences, in, rates, favorable, to, the, standard, oil, co, while, large, differences, in, distances, are, ignored, where, they, are, against, the, standard, sometimes, connecting, roads, prorate, on, oil, that, is, make, through, rates, which, are, lower, than, the, combination, of, local, rates, sometimes, they, refuse, to, prorate, but, in, either, case, the, result, of, their, policy, is, to, favor, the, standard, oil, co, different, methods, are, used, in, different, places, and, under, different, conditions, but, the, net, result, is, that, from, maine, to, california, the, general, arrangement, of, open, rates, on, petroleum, oil, is, such, as, to, give, the, standard, an, unreasonable, advantage, over, its, competitors, the, government, said, that, standard, raised, prices, to, its, monopolistic, customers, but, lowered, them, to, hurt, competitors, often, disguising, its, illegal, actions, by, using, bogus, supposedly, independent, companies, it, controlled, the, evidence, is, in, fact, absolutely, conclusive, that, the, standard, oil, co, charges, altogether, excessive, prices, where, it, meets, no, competition, and, particularly, where, there, is, little, likelihood, of, competitors, entering, the, field, and, that, on, the, other, hand, where, competition, is, active, it, frequently, cuts, prices, to, a, point, which, leaves, even, the, standard, little, or, no, profit, and, which, more, often, leaves, no, profit, to, the, competitor, whose, costs, are, ordinarily, somewhat, higher, on, may, 15, 1911, the, us, supreme, court, upheld, the, lower, court, judgment, and, declared, the, standard, oil, group, to, be, an, unreasonable, monopoly, under, the, sherman, antitrust, act, section, ii, it, ordered, standard, to, break, up, into, 39, independent, companies, with, different, boards, of, directors, the, biggest, two, of, the, companies, being, standard, oil, of, new, jersey, which, became, exxon, and, standard, oil, of, new, york, which, became, mobil, standard, s, president, john, d, rockefeller, had, long, since, retired, from, any, management, role, but, as, he, owned, a, quarter, of, the, shares, of, the, resultant, companies, and, those, share, values, mostly, doubled, he, emerged, from, the, dissolution, as, the, richest, man, in, the, world, the, dissolution, had, actually, propelled, rockefeller, s, personal, wealth, by, 1911, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, ruled, in, standard, oil, co, of, new, jersey, v, united, states, that, standard, oil, of, new, jersey, must, be, dissolved, under, the, sherman, antitrust, act, and, split, into, 39, companies, two, of, these, companies, were, standard, oil, of, new, jersey, jersey, standard, or, esso, which, eventually, became, exxon, and, standard, oil, of, new, york, socony, which, eventually, became, mobil, those, two, companies, later, merged, into, exxonmobil, over, the, next, few, decades, both, companies, grew, significantly, jersey, standard, led, by, walter, c, teagle, became, the, largest, oil, producer, in, the, world, it, acquired, a, 50, percent, share, in, humble, oil, refining,

refineries, in, the, dutch, east, indies, but, no, marketing, network, socony, vacuum, had, asian, marketing, outlets, supplied, remotely, from, california, in, 1933, jersey, standard, and, socony, vacuum, merged, their, interests, in, the, region, into, a, 50, 50, joint, venture, standard, vacuum, oil, co, or, stanvac, operated, in, 50, countries, from, east, africa, to, new, zealand, before, it, was, dissolved, in, 1962, rockefeller, s, original, company, standard, oil, company, of, ohio, sohio, effectively, ceased, to, exist, when, it, was, purchased, by, bp, in, 1987, bp, continued, to, sell, gasoline, under, the, sohio, brand, until, 1991, other, standard, oil, entities, include, standard, oil, of, indiana, which, became, amoco, after, other, mergers, and, a, name, change, in, the, 1980s, and, standard, oil, of, california, which, became, the, chevron, corp, some, have, speculated, that, if, not, for, that, court, ruling, standard, oil, could, have, possibly, been, worth, more, than, 1, trillion, in, the, 2000s, whether, the, breakup, of, standard, oil, was, beneficial, is, a, matter, of, some, controversy, some, economists, believe, that, standard, oil, was, not, a, monopoly, and, argue, that, the, intense, free, market, competition, resulted, in, cheaper, oil, prices, and, more, diverse, petroleum, products, critics, claimed, that, success, in, meeting, consumer, needs, was, driving, other, companies, who, were, not, as, successful, out, of, the, market, an, example, of, this, thinking, was, given, in, 1890, when, rep, william, mason, arguing, in, favor, of, the, sherman, antitrust, act, said, trusts, have, made, products, cheaper, have, reduced, prices, but, if, the, price, of, oil, for, instance, were, reduced, to, one, cent, a, barrel, it, would, not, right, the, wrong, done, to, people, of, this, country, by, the, trusts, which, have, destroyed, legitimate, competition, and, driven, honest, men, from, legitimate, business, enterprise, the, sherman, antitrust, act, prohibits, the, restraint, of, trade, defenders, of, standard, oil, insist, that, the, company, did, not, restrain, trade, they, were, simply, superior, competitors, the, federal, courts, ruled, otherwise, some, economic, historians, have, observed, that, standard, oil, was, in, the, process, of, losing, its, monopoly, at, the, time, of, its, breakup, in, 1911, although, standard, had, 90, percent, of, american, refining, capacity, in, 1880, by, 1911, that, had, shrunk, to, between, 60, and, 65, percent, because, of, the, expansion, in, capacity, by, competitors, numerous, regional, competitors, such, as, pure, oil, in, the, east, texaco, and, gulf, oil, in, the, gulf, coast, cities, service, and, sun, in, the, midcontinent, union, in, california, and, shell, overseas, had, organized, themselves, into, competitive, vertically, integrated, oil, companies, the, industry, structure, pioneered, years, earlier, by, standard, itself, in, addition, demand, for, petroleum, products, was, increasing, more, rapidly, than, the, ability, of, standard, to, expand, the, result, was, that, although, in, 1911, standard, still, controlled, most, production, in, the, older, regions, of, the, appalachian, basin, 78, percent, share, down, from, 92, percent, in, 1880, lima, indiana, 90, percent, down, from, 95, percent, in, 1906, and, the, illinois, basin, 83, percent, down, from, 100, percent, in, 1906, its, share, was, much, lower, in, the, rapidly, expanding, new, regions, that, would, dominate, u, s, oil, production, in, the, 20th, century, in, 1911, standard, controlled, only, 44, percent, of, production, in, the, midcontinent, 29, percent, in, california, and, 10, percent, on, the, gulf, coast, some, analysts, argue, that, the, breakup, was, beneficial, to, consumers, in, the, long, run, and, no, one, has, ever, proposed, that, standard, oil, be, reassembled, in, pre, 1911, form, exxonmobil, however, does, represent, a, substantial, part, of, the, original, company, since, the, breakup, of, standard, oil, several, companies, such, as, general, motors, and, microsoft, have, come, under, antitrust, investigation, for, being, inherently, too, large, for, market, competition, however, most, of, them, remained, together, the, only, company, since, the, breakup, of, standard, oil, that, was, divided, into, parts, like, standard, oil, was, at, t, which, after, decades, as, a, regulated, natural, monopoly, was, forced, to, divest, itself, of, the, bell, system, in, 1984, standard, oil, s, breakup, split, the, company, into, 39, separate, companies, several, of, these, companies, were, considered, among, the, seven, sisters, who, dominated, the, industry, worldwide, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, and, both, standard, oil, s, direct, and, indirect, descendants, make, up, big, oil, today, standard, oil, s, influence, is, primarily, concentrated, in, a, few, companies, many, of, today, s, largest, oil, and, gas, companies, are, or, have, acquired, a, descendant, of, standard, oil, moreover, many, other, companies, have, acquired, or, been, created, from, standard, oil, descendants, over, time, including, unilever, which, acquired, standard, descendant, vaseline, in, 1987, transunion, created, originally, as, a, holding, company, for, standard, descendant, union, tank, car, and, berkshire, hathaway, which, later, acquired, union, tank, car, of, the, 39, baby, standards, 11, were, given, rights, to, the, standard, oil, name, based, on, the, state, they, were, in, conoco, and, atlantic, elected, to, use, their, respective, names, instead, of, the, standard, name, and, their, rights, would, be, claimed, by, other, companies, by, the, 1980s, most, companies, were, using, their, brand, names, instead, of, the, standard, name, with, amoco, being, the, last, one, to, have, widespread, use, of, the, standard, name, as, it, gave, midwestern, owners, the, option, of, using, the, amoco, name, or, standard, three, supermajor, companies, now, own, the, rights, to, the, standard, name, in, the, united, states, exxonmobil, chevron, corp, and, bp, bp, acquired, its, rights, through, acquiring, standard, oil, of, ohio, and, merging, with, amoco, and, has, a, small, handful, of, stations, in, the, midwestern, united, states, using, the, standard, name, likewise, bp, continues, to, sell, marine, fuel, under, the, sohio, brand, at, various, marinas, throughout, ohio, exxonmobil, keeps, the, esso, trademark, alive, at, stations, that, sell, diesel, fuel, by, selling, esso, diesel, displayed, on, the, pumps, exxonmobil, has, full, international, rights, to, the, standard, name, and, continues, to, use, the, esso, name, overseas, and, in, canada, to, protect, its, trademark, chevron, has, one, station, in, each, state, it, owns, the, rights, to, be, branded, as, standard, some, of, its, standard, branded, stations, have, a, mix, of, some, signs, that, say, standard, and, some, signs, that, say, chevron, over, time, chevron, has, changed, which, station, in, a, given, state, is, the, standard, station, in, february, 2016, exxonmobil, successfully, asked, a, u, s, federal, court, to, lift, the, 1930s, trademark, injunction, that, banned, it, from, using, the, esso, brand, in, some, states, neither, bp, nor, chevron, objected, to, the, decision, exxonmobil, asked, for, it, to, be, lifted, primarily, so, it, could, have, universal, marketing, material, for, its, stations, globally, and, likewise, the, esso, name, returned, to, some, minor, station, signage, at, both, exxon, and, mobil, stations, as, of, 2021, six, states, that, have, the, standard, oil, name, rights, are, not, being, actively, used, by, the, companies, that, own, them, chevron, withdrew, from, kentucky, home, of, the, standard, oil, of, kentucky, which, chevron, acquired, in, 1961, in, 2010, while, bp, gradually, withdrew, from, five, great, plains, and, rocky, mountain, states, colorado, montana, north, dakota, oklahoma, and, wyoming, since, the, initial, conversion, of, amoco, sites, to, bp, as, exxonmobil, has, stations, in, all, of, these, states, with, the, aforementioned, minor, signage, exxonmobil, has, de, facto, claimed, the, standard, trademark, in, these, states, though, they, are, still, held, by, their, respective, rights, holders
