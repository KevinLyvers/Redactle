naval, warfare, is, combat, in, and, on, the, sea, the, ocean, or, any, other, battlespace, involving, a, major, body, of, water, such, as, a, large, lake, or, wide, river, the, armed, forces, branch, designated, for, naval, warfare, is, a, navy, naval, operations, can, be, broadly, divided, into, riverine, littoral, applications, brown, water, navy, open, ocean, applications, blue, water, navy, between, riverine, littoral, and, open, ocean, applications, green, water, navy, although, these, distinctions, are, more, about, strategic, scope, than, tactical, or, operational, division, the, strategic, offensive, purpose, of, naval, warfare, is, projection, of, force, by, water, and, its, strategic, defensive, purpose, is, to, challenge, the, similar, projection, of, force, by, enemies, mankind, has, fought, battles, on, the, sea, for, more, than, 3, 000, years, even, in, the, interior, of, large, landmasses, transportation, before, the, advent, of, extensive, railways, was, largely, dependent, upon, rivers, lakes, canals, and, other, navigable, waterways, the, latter, were, crucial, in, the, development, of, the, modern, world, in, the, united, kingdom, america, the, low, countries, and, northern, germany, because, they, enabled, the, bulk, movement, of, goods, and, raw, material, which, supported, the, nascent, industrial, revolution, prior, to, 1750, materials, largely, moved, by, river, barge, or, sea, vessels, thus, armies, with, their, exorbitant, needs, for, food, ammunition, and, fodder, were, tied, to, the, river, valleys, throughout, the, ages, pre, recorded, history, homeric, legends, e, g, troy, and, classical, works, such, as, the, odyssey, emphasize, the, sea, the, persian, empire, united, and, strong, could, not, prevail, against, the, might, of, the, athenian, fleet, combined, with, that, of, lesser, city, states, in, several, attempts, to, conquer, the, greek, city, states, phoenicia, s, and, egypt, s, power, carthage, s, and, even, rome, s, largely, depended, upon, control, of, the, seas, so, too, did, the, venetian, republic, dominate, italy, s, city, states, thwart, the, ottoman, empire, and, dominate, commerce, on, the, silk, road, and, the, mediterranean, in, general, for, centuries, for, three, centuries, vikings, raided, and, pillaged, far, into, central, russia, and, ukraine, and, even, to, distant, constantinople, both, via, the, black, sea, tributaries, sicily, and, through, the, strait, of, gibraltar, gaining, control, of, the, sea, has, largely, depended, on, a, fleet, s, ability, to, wage, sea, battles, throughout, most, of, naval, history, naval, warfare, revolved, around, two, overarching, concerns, namely, boarding, and, anti, boarding, it, was, only, in, the, late, 16th, century, when, gunpowder, technology, had, developed, to, a, considerable, extent, that, the, tactical, focus, at, sea, shifted, to, heavy, ordnance, many, sea, battles, through, history, also, provide, a, reliable, source, of, shipwrecks, for, underwater, archaeology, a, major, example, is, the, exploration, of, the, wrecks, of, various, warships, in, the, pacific, ocean, the, first, recorded, sea, battle, was, the, battle, of, the, delta, the, ancient, egyptians, defeated, the, sea, peoples, in, a, sea, battle, c, 1175, bc, as, recorded, on, the, temple, walls, of, the, mortuary, temple, of, pharaoh, ramesses, iii, at, medinet, habu, this, repulsed, a, major, sea, invasion, near, the, shores, of, the, eastern, nile, delta, using, a, naval, ambush, and, archers, firing, from, both, ships, and, shore, assyrian, reliefs, from, the, 8th, century, bc, show, phoenician, fighting, ships, with, two, levels, of, oars, fighting, men, on, a, sort, of, bridge, or, deck, above, the, oarsmen, and, some, sort, of, ram, protruding, from, the, bow, no, written, mention, of, strategy, or, tactics, seems, to, have, survived, josephus, flavius, antiquities, ix, 283, 287, reports, a, naval, battle, between, tyre, and, the, king, of, assyria, who, was, aided, by, the, other, cities, in, phoenicia, the, battle, took, place, off, the, shores, of, tyre, although, the, tyrian, fleet, was, much, smaller, the, tyrians, defeated, their, enemies, the, greeks, of, homer, just, used, their, ships, as, transport, for, land, armies, but, in, 664, bc, there, is, a, mention, of, a, battle, at, sea, between, corinth, and, its, colony, city, corcyra, ancient, descriptions, of, the, persian, wars, were, the, first, to, feature, large, scale, naval, operations, not, just, sophisticated, fleet, engagements, with, dozens, of, triremes, on, each, side, but, combined, land, sea, operations, it, seems, unlikely, that, all, this, was, the, product, of, a, single, mind, or, even, of, a, generation, most, likely, the, period, of, evolution, and, experimentation, was, simply, not, recorded, by, history, after, some, initial, battles, while, subjugating, the, greeks, of, the, ionian, coast, the, persians, determined, to, invade, greece, proper, themistocles, of, athens, estimated, that, the, greeks, would, be, outnumbered, by, the, persians, on, land, but, that, athens, could, protect, itself, by, building, a, fleet, the, famous, wooden, walls, using, the, profits, of, the, silver, mines, at, laurium, to, finance, them, the, first, persian, campaign, in, 492, bc, was, aborted, because, the, fleet, was, lost, in, a, storm, but, the, second, in, 490, bc, captured, islands, in, the, aegean, sea, before, landing, on, the, mainland, near, marathon, attacks, by, the, greek, armies, repulsed, these, the, third, persian, campaign, in, 480, bc, under, xerxes, i, of, persia, followed, the, pattern, of, the, second, in, marching, the, army, via, the, hellespont, while, the, fleet, paralleled, them, offshore, near, artemisium, in, the, narrow, channel, between, the, mainland, and, euboea, the, greek, fleet, held, off, multiple, assaults, by, the, persians, the, persians, breaking, through, a, first, line, but, then, being, flanked, by, the, second, line, of, ships, but, the, defeat, on, land, at, thermopylae, forced, a, greek, withdrawal, and, athens, evacuated, its, population, to, nearby, salamis, island, the, ensuing, battle, of, salamis, was, one, of, the, decisive, engagements, of, history, themistocles, trapped, the, persians, in, a, channel, too, narrow, for, them, to, bring, their, greater, numbers, to, bear, and, attacked, them, vigorously, in, the, end, causing, the, loss, of, 200, persian, ships, vs, 40, greek, aeschylus, wrote, a, play, about, the, defeat, the, persians, which, was, performed, in, a, greek, theatre, competition, a, few, years, after, the, battle, it, is, the, oldest, known, surviving, play, at, the, end, xerxes, still, had, a, fleet, stronger, than, the, greeks, but, withdrew, anyway, and, after, losing, at, plataea, in, the, following, year, returned, to, asia, minor, leaving, the, greeks, their, freedom, nevertheless, the, athenians, and, spartans, attacked, and, burned, the, laid, up, persian, fleet, at, mycale, and, freed, many, of, the, ionian, towns, these, battles, involved, triremes, or, biremes, as, the, standard, fighting, platform, and, the, focus, of, the, battle, was, to, ram, the, opponent, s, vessel, using, the, boat, s, reinforced, prow, the, opponent, would, try, to, maneuver, and, avoid, contact, or, alternately, rush, all, the, marines, to, the, side, about, to, be, hit, thus, tilting, the, boat, when, the, ram, had, withdrawn, and, the, marines, dispersed, the, hole, would, then, be, above, the, waterline, and, not, a, critical, injury, to, the, ship, during, the, next, fifty, years, the, greeks, commanded, the, aegean, but, not, harmoniously, after, several, minor, wars, tensions, exploded, into, the, peloponnesian, war, 431, bc, between, athens, delian, league, and, the, spartan, peloponnese, naval, strategy, was, critical, athens, walled, itself, off, from, the, rest, of, greece, leaving, only, the, port, at, piraeus, open, and, trusting, in, its, navy, to, keep, supplies, flowing, while, the, spartan, army, besieged, it, this, strategy, worked, although, the, close, quarters, likely, contributed, to, the, plague, that, killed, many, athenians, in, 429, bc, there, were, a, number, of, sea, battles, between, galleys, at, rhium, naupactus, pylos, syracuse, cynossema, cyzicus, notium, but, the, end, came, for, athens, in, 405, bc, at, aegospotami, in, the, hellespont, where, the, athenians, had, drawn, up, their, fleet, on, the, beach, and, were, surprised, by, the, spartan, fleet, who, landed, and, burned, all, the, ships, athens, surrendered, to, sparta, in, the, following, year, navies, next, played, a, major, role, in, the, complicated, wars, of, the, successors, of, alexander, the, great, the, roman, republic, had, never, been, much, of, a, seafaring, nation, but, it, had, to, learn, in, the, punic, wars, with, carthage, romans, developed, the, technique, of, grappling, and, boarding, enemy, ships, with, soldiers, the, roman, navy, grew, gradually, as, rome, became, more, involved, in, mediterranean, politics, by, the, time, of, the, roman, civil, war, and, the, battle, of, actium, 31, bc, hundreds, of, ships, were, involved, many, of, them, quinqueremes, mounting, catapults, and, fighting, towers, following, the, emperor, augustus, transforming, the, republic, into, the, roman, empire, rome, gained, control, of, most, of, the, mediterranean, without, any, significant, maritime, enemies, the, roman, navy, was, reduced, mostly, to, patrolling, for, pirates, and, transportation, duties, it, was, only, on, the, fringes, of, the, empire, in, newly, gained, provinces, or, defensive, missions, against, barbarian, invasion, that, the, navy, still, engaged, in, actual, warfare, while, the, barbarian, invasions, of, the, 4th, century, and, later, mostly, occurred, by, land, some, notable, examples, of, naval, conflicts, are, known, in, the, late, 3rd, century, in, the, reign, of, emperor, gallienus, a, large, raiding, party, composed, by, goths, gepids, and, heruli, launched, itself, in, the, black, sea, raiding, the, coasts, of, anatolia, and, thrace, and, crossing, into, the, aegean, sea, plundering, mainland, greece, including, athens, and, sparta, and, going, as, far, as, crete, and, rhodes, in, the, twilight, of, the, roman, empire, in, the, late, 4th, century, examples, include, that, of, emperor, majorian, who, with, the, help, of, constantinople, mustered, a, large, fleet, in, a, failed, effort, to, expel, the, germanic, invaders, from, their, recently, conquered, african, territories, and, a, defeat, of, an, ostrogothic, fleet, at, sena, gallica, in, the, adriatic, sea, during, the, muslim, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, muslim, fleets, first, appeared, raiding, sicily, in, 652, see, history, of, islam, in, southern, italy, and, emirate, of, sicily, and, defeating, the, byzantine, navy, in, 655, constantinople, was, saved, from, a, prolonged, arab, siege, in, 678, by, the, invention, of, greek, fire, an, early, form, of, flamethrower, that, was, devastating, to, the, ships, in, the, besieging, fleet, these, were, the, first, of, many, encounters, during, the, byzantine, arab, wars, the, caliphate, became, the, dominant, naval, power, in, the, mediterranean, sea, from, the, 7th, to, 13th, centuries, during, what, is, known, as, the, islamic, golden, age, one, of, the, most, significant, inventions, in, medieval, naval, warfare, was, the, torpedo, invented, in, syria, by, the, arab, inventor, hasan, al, rammah, in, 1275, his, torpedo, ran, on, water, with, a, rocket, system, filled, with, explosive, gunpowder, materials, and, had, three, firing, points, it, was, an, effective, weapon, against, ships, in, the, 8th, century, the, vikings, appeared, although, their, usual, style, was, to, appear, quickly, plunder, and, disappear, preferably, attacking, undefended, locations, the, vikings, raided, places, along, the, coastline, of, england, and, france, with, the, greatest, threats, being, in, england, they, would, raid, monasteries, for, their, wealth, and, lack, of, formidable, defenders, they, also, utilized, rivers, and, other, auxiliary, waterways, to, work, their, way, inland, in, the, eventual, invasion, of, britain, they, wreaked, havoc, in, northumbria, and, mercia, and, the, rest, of, anglia, before, being, halted, by, wessex, king, alfred, the, great, of, england, was, able, to, stay, the, viking, invasions, with, a, pivotal, victory, at, the, battle, of, edington, alfred, defeated, guthrum, establishing, the, boundaries, of, danelaw, in, an, 884, treaty, the, effectiveness, of, alfred, s, fleet, has, been, debated, kenneth, harl, has, pointed, out, that, as, few, as, eleven, ships, were, sent, to, combat, the, vikings, only, two, of, which, were, not, beaten, back, or, captured, the, vikings, also, fought, several, sea, battles, among, themselves, this, was, normally, done, by, binding, the, ships, on, each, side, together, thus, essentially, fighting, a, land, battle, on, the, sea, however, the, fact, that, the, losing, side, could, not, easily, escape, meant, that, battles, tended, to, be, hard, and, bloody, the, battle, of, svolder, is, perhaps, the, most, famous, of, these, battles, as, muslim, power, in, the, mediterranean, began, to, wane, the, italian, trading, towns, of, genoa, pisa, and, venice, stepped, in, to, seize, the, opportunity, setting, up, commercial, networks, and, building, navies, to, protect, them, at, first, the, navies, fought, with, the, arabs, off, bari, in, 1004, at, messina, in, 1005, but, then, they, found, themselves,

last, ended, with, a, decisive, venetian, victory, giving, it, almost, a, century, to, enjoy, mediterranean, trade, domination, before, other, european, countries, began, expanding, into, the, south, and, west, in, the, north, of, europe, the, near, continuous, conflict, between, england, and, france, was, characterised, by, raids, on, coastal, towns, and, ports, along, the, coastlines, and, the,

40, under, hubert, de, burgh, is, notable, as, the, first, recorded, battle, using, sailing, ship, tactics, the, battle, of, arnemuiden, 23, september, 1338, which, resulted, in, a, french, victory, marked, the, opening, of, the, hundred, years, war, and, was, the, first, battle, involving, artillery, however, the, battle, of, sluys, fought, two, years, later, saw, the, destruction, of, the,

china, the, first, known, naval, battles, took, place, during, the, warring, states, period, 481, 221, bc, when, vassal, lords, battled, one, another, chinese, naval, warfare, in, this, period, featured, grapple, and, hook, as, well, as, ramming, tactics, with, ships, called, stomach, strikers, and, colliding, swoopers, it, was, written, in, the, han, dynasty, that, the, people, of, the, warring, states, era, had, employed, chuan, ge, ships, dagger, axe, ships, or, halberd, ships, thought, to, be, a, simple, description, of, ships, manned, by, marines, carrying, dagger, axe, halberds, as, personal, weapons, the, 3rd, century, writer, zhang, yan, asserted, that, the, people, of, the, warring, states, period, named, the, boats, this, way, because, halberd, blades, were, actually, fixed, and, attached, to, the, hull, of, the, ship, in, order, to, rip, into, the, hull, of, another, ship, while, ramming, to, stab, enemies, in, the, water, that, had, fallen, overboard, and, were, swimming, or, simply, to, clear, any, possible, dangerous, marine, animals, in, the, path, of, the, ship, since, the, ancient, chinese, did, believe, in, sea, monsters, see, xu, fu, for, more, info, qin, shi, huang, the, first, emperor, of, the, qin, dynasty, 221, 207, bc, owed, much, of, his, success, in, unifying, southern, china, to, naval, power, although, an, official, navy, was, not, yet, established, see, medieval, asia, section, below, the, people, of, the, zhou, dynasty, were, known, to, use, temporary, pontoon, bridges, for, general, means, of, transportation, but, it, was, during, the, qin, and, han, dynasties, that, large, permanent, pontoon, bridges, were, assembled, and, used, in, warfare, first, written, account, of, a, pontoon, bridge, in, the, west, being, the, oversight, of, the, greek, mandrocles, of, samos, in, aiding, a, military, campaign, of, persian, emperor, darius, i, over, the, bosporus, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, the, chinese, began, using, the, stern, mounted, steering, rudder, and, they, also, designed, a, new, ship, type, the, junk, from, the, late, han, dynasty, to, the, three, kingdoms, period, 220, 280, ad, large, naval, battles, such, as, the, battle, of, red, cliffs, marked, the, advancement, of, naval, warfare, in, the, east, in, the, latter, engagement, the, allied, forces, of, sun, quan, and, liu, bei, destroyed, a, large, fleet, commanded, by, cao, cao, in, a, fire, based, naval, attack, in, terms, of, seafaring, abroad, arguably, one, of, the, first, chinese, to, sail, into, the, indian, ocean, and, to, reach, sri, lanka, and, india, by, sea, was, the, buddhist, monk, faxian, in, the, early, 5th, century, although, diplomatic, ties, and, land, trade, to, persia, and, india, were, established, during, the, earlier, han, dynasty, however, chinese, naval, maritime, influence, would, penetrate, into, the, indian, ocean, until, the, medieval, period, the, late, middle, ages, saw, the, development, of, the, cogs, caravels, and, carracks, ships, capable, of, surviving, the, tough, conditions, of, the, open, ocean, with, enough, backup, systems, and, crew, expertise, to, make, long, voyages, routine, in, addition, they, grew, from, 100, tons, to, 300, tons, displacement, enough, to, carry, cannon, as, armament, and, still, have, space, for, cargo, one, of, the, largest, ships, of, the, time, the, great, harry, displaced, over, 1, 500, tons, the, voyages, of, discovery, were, fundamentally, commercial, rather, than, military, in, nature, although, the, line, was, sometimes, blurry, in, that, a, country, s, ruler, was, not, above, funding, exploration, for, personal, profit, nor, was, it, a, problem, to, use, military, power, to, enhance, that, profit, later, the, lines, gradually, separated, in, that, the, ruler, s, motivation, in, using, the, navy, was, to, protect, private, enterprise, so, that, they, could, pay, more, taxes, like, the, egyptian, shia, fatimids, and, mamluks, the, sunni, islamic, ottoman, empire, centered, in, modern, day, turkey, dominated, the, eastern, mediterranean, sea, the, ottomans, built, a, powerful, navy, rivaling, the, italian, city, state, of, venice, during, the, ottoman, venetian, war, 1499, 1503, although, they, were, sorely, defeated, in, the, battle, of, lepanto, 1571, by, the, holy, league, the, ottomans, soon, rebuilt, their, naval, strength, and, afterwards, successfully, defended, the, island, of, cyprus, so, that, it, would, stay, in, ottoman, hands, however, with, the, concurrent, age, of, discovery, europe, had, far, surpassed, the, ottoman, empire, and, successfully, bypassed, their, reliance, on, land, trade, by, discovering, maritime, routes, around, africa, and, towards, the, americas, the, first, naval, action, in, defense, of, the, new, colonies, was, just, ten, years, after, vasco, da, gama, s, epochal, landing, in, india, in, march, 1508, a, combined, gujarati, egyptian, force, surprised, a, portuguese, squadron, at, chaul, and, only, two, portuguese, ships, escaped, the, following, february, the, portuguese, viceroy, destroyed, the, allied, fleet, at, diu, confirming, portuguese, domination, of, the, indian, ocean, in, 1582, the, battle, of, ponta, delgada, in, the, azores, in, which, a, spanish, portuguese, fleet, defeated, a, combined, french, and, portuguese, force, with, some, english, direct, support, thus, ending, the, portuguese, succession, crisis, was, the, first, battle, fought, in, mid, atlantic, in, 1588, spanish, king, philip, ii, sent, his, armada, to, subdue, the, english, fleet, of, elizabeth, but, admiral, sir, charles, howard, defeated, the, armada, marking, the, rise, to, prominence, of, the, english, royal, navy, however, it, was, unable, to, follow, up, with, a, decisive, blow, against, the, spanish, navy, which, remained, the, most, important, for, another, half, century, after, the, war, s, end, in, 1604, the, english, fleet, went, through, a, time, of, relative, neglect, and, decline, in, the, 16th, century, the, barbary, states, of, north, africa, rose, to, power, becoming, a, dominant, naval, power, in, the, mediterranean, sea, due, to, the, barbary, pirates, the, coastal, villages, and, towns, of, italy, spain, and, mediterranean, islands, were, frequently, attacked, and, long, stretches, of, the, italian, and, spanish, coasts, were, almost, completely, abandoned, by, their, inhabitants, after, 1600, barbary, pirates, occasionally, entered, the, atlantic, and, struck, as, far, north, as, iceland, according, to, robert, davis, as, many, as, 1, 25, million, europeans, were, captured, by, barbary, pirates, and, sold, as, slaves, in, north, africa, and, the, ottoman, empire, between, the, 16th, and, 19th, centuries, these, slaves, were, captured, mainly, from, seaside, villages, in, italy, spain, and, portugal, and, from, farther, places, like, france, england, the, netherlands, ireland, and, even, iceland, and, north, america, the, barbary, pirates, were, also, able, to, successfully, defeat, and, capture, many, european, ships, largely, due, to, advances, in, sailing, technology, by, the, barbary, states, the, earliest, naval, trawler, xebec, and, windward, ships, were, employed, by, the, barbary, pirates, from, the, 16th, century, from, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, competition, between, the, expanding, english, and, dutch, commercial, fleets, came, to, a, head, in, the, anglo, dutch, wars, the, first, wars, to, be, conducted, entirely, at, sea, most, memorable, of, these, battles, was, the, raid, on, the, medway, in, which, the, dutch, admiral, michiel, de, ruyter, sailed, up, the, river, thames, and, destroyed, most, of, the, british, fleet, this, remains, the, greatest, english, naval, defeat, and, established, dutch, supremacy, at, sea, for, over, half, a, century, very, few, ships, were, sunk, in, naval, combat, during, the, anglo, dutch, wars, as, it, was, difficult, to, hit, ships, below, the, water, level, the, water, surface, deflected, cannonballs, and, the, few, holes, produced, could, be, patched, quickly, naval, cannonades, damaged, men, and, sails, more, than, they, sunk, ships, the, 18th, century, developed, into, a, period, of, seemingly, continuous, international, wars, each, larger, than, the, last, at, sea, the, british, and, french, were, bitter, rivals, the, french, aided, the, fledgling, united, states, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, but, their, strategic, purpose, was, to, capture, territory, in, india, and, the, west, indies, which, they, did, not, achieve, in, the, baltic, sea, the, final, attempt, to, revive, the, swedish, empire, led, to, gustav, iii, s, russian, war, with, its, grande, finale, at, the, second, battle, of, svensksund, the, battle, unrivaled, in, size, until, the, 20th, century, was, a, decisive, swedish, tactical, victory, but, it, resulted, in, little, strategical, result, due, to, poor, army, performance, and, previous, lack, of, initiative, from, the, swedes, and, the, war, ended, with, no, territorial, changes, even, the, change, of, government, due, to, the, french, revolution, seemed, to, intensify, rather, than, diminish, the, rivalry, and, the, napoleonic, wars, included, a, series, of, legendary, naval, battles, culminating, in, the, battle, of, trafalgar, in, 1805, by, which, admiral, horatio, nelson, broke, the, power, of, the, french, and, spanish, fleets, but, lost, his, own, life, in, so, doing, trafalgar, ushered, in, the, pax, britannica, of, the, 19th, century, marked, by, general, peace, in, the, world, s, oceans, under, the, ensigns, of, the, royal, navy, but, the, period, was, one, of, intensive, experimentation, with, new, technology, steam, power, for, ships, appeared, in, the, 1810s, improved, metallurgy, and, machining, technique, produced, larger, and, deadlier, guns, and, the, development, of, explosive, shells, capable, of, demolishing, a, wooden, ship, at, a, single, blow, in, turn, required, the, addition, of, iron, armour, although, naval, power, during, the, song, yuan, and, ming, dynasties, established, china, as, a, major, world, seapower, in, the, east, the, qing, dynasty, lacked, an, official, standing, navy, they, were, more, interested, in, pouring, funds, into, military, ventures, closer, to, home, china, proper, such, as, mongolia, tibet, and, central, asia, modern, xinjiang, however, there, were, some, considerable, naval, conflicts, involving, the, qing, navy, before, the, first, opium, war, such, as, the, battle, of, penghu, and, the, capture, of, formosa, from, ming, loyalists, the, qing, navy, proved, woefully, undermatched, during, the, first, and, second, opium, wars, leaving, china, open, to, de, facto, foreign, domination, portions, of, the, chinese, coastline, were, placed, under, western, and, japanese, spheres, of, influence, the, qing, government, responded, to, its, defeat, in, the, opium, wars, by, attempting, to, modernize, the, chinese, navy, placing, several, contracts, in, european, shipyards, for, modern, warships, the, result, of, these, developments, was, the, beiyang, fleet, which, was, dealt, a, severe, blow, by, the, imperial, japanese, navy, in, the, first, sino, japanese, war, 1894, 1895, the, battle, between, css, virginia, and, uss, monitor, in, the, american, civil, war, was, a, duel, of, ironclads, that, symbolized, the, changing, times, the, first, fleet, action, between, ironclad, ships, was, fought, in, 1866, at, the, battle, of, lissa, between, the, navies, of, austria, and, italy, because, the, decisive, moment, of, the, battle, occurred, when, the, austrian, flagship, sms, erzherzog, ferdinand, max, successfully, sank, the, italian, flagship, re, d, italia, by, ramming, in, subsequent, decade, every, navy, in, the, world, largely, focused, on, ramming, as, the, main, tactic, the, last, known, use, of, ramming, in, a, naval, battle, was, in, 1915, when, hms, dreadnought, rammed, the, surfaced, german, submarine, u, 29, the, last, surface, ship, sunk, by, ramming, happened, in, 1879, when, the, peruvian, ship, hu, scar, rammed, the, chilean, ship, esmeralda, the, last, known, warship, equipped, with, a, ram, was, launched, in, 1908, the, german, light, cruiser, sms, emden, with, the, advent, of, the, steamship, it, became, possible, to, create, massive, gun, platforms, and, to, provide, them, with, heavy, armor, resulting, in, the, first, modern, battleships, the, battles, of, santiago, de, cuba, and, tsushima, demonstrated, the, power, of, these, ships, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, modern, battleship, emerged, a, steel, armored, ship, entirely, dependent, on, steam, propulsion, with, a, main, battery, of, uniform, caliber, guns, mounted, in, turrets, on, the, main, deck, this, type, was, pioneered, in, 1906, with, hms, dreadnought, which, mounted, a, main, battery, of, ten, 12, inch, 300, mm, guns, instead, of, the, mixed, caliber, main, battery, of, previous, designs, along, with, her, main, battery, dreadnought, and, her, successors, retained, a, secondary, battery, for, use, against, smaller, ships, like, destroyers, and, torpedo, boats, and, later, aircraft, dreadnought, style, battleships, dominated, fleets, in, the, early, 20th, century, they, would, play, major, parts, in, both, the, russo, japanese, war, and, world, war, i, the, russo, japanese, war, saw, the, rise, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, after, their, underdog, victory, against, the, waning, imperial, russian, navy, at, the, battle, of, tsushima, while, wwi, pitted, the, old, royal, navy, against, the, new, kaiserliche, marine, of, imperial, germany, culminating, in, the, 1916, battle, of, jutland, the, future, was, heralded, when, the, seaplane, carrier, hms, engadine, and, her, short, 184, seaplanes, joined, the, battle, in, the, black, sea, russian, seaplanes, flying, from, a, fleet, of, converted, carriers, interdicted, turkish, maritime, supply, routes, allied, air, patrols, began, to, counter, german, u, boat, activity, in, britain, s, coastal, waters, and, a, british, short, 184, carried, out, the, first, successful, torpedo, attack, on, a, ship, in, 1918, the, royal, navy, converted, an, italian, liner, to, create, the, first, aircraft, carrier, hms, argus, and, shortly, after, the, war, the, first, purpose, built, carrier, hms, hermes, was, launched, many, nations, agreed, to, the, washington, naval, treaty, and, scrapped, many, of, their, battleships, and, cruisers, while, still, in, the, shipyards, but, the, growing, tensions, of, the, 1930s, restarted, the, building, programs, with, even, larger, ships, the, yamato, class, battleships, the, largest, ever, displaced, 72, 000, tons, and, mounted, 18, 1, inch, 460, mm, guns, the, victory, of, the, royal, navy, at, the, battle, of, taranto, was, a, pivotal, point, as, this, was, the, first, true, demonstration, of, naval, air, power, the, importance, of, naval, air, power, was, further, reinforced, by, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, which, forced, the, united, states, to, enter, world, war, ii, nevertheless, in, both, taranto, and, pearl, harbor, the, aircraft, mainly, attacked, stationary, battleships, the, sinking, of, the, british, battleships, hms, prince, of, wales, and, hms, repulse, which, were, in, full, combat, manoeuvring, at, the, time, of, the, attack, finally, marked, the, end, of, the, battleship, era, aircraft, and, their, transportation, the, aircraft, carrier, came, to, the, fore, during, the, pacific, war, of, world, war, ii, battleships, and, cruisers, spent, most, of, their, time, escorting, aircraft, carriers, and, bombarding, shore, positions, while, the, carriers, and, their, airplanes, were, the, stars, of, the, battle, of, the, coral, sea, battle, of, midway, battle, of, the, eastern, solomons, battle, of, the, santa, cruz, islands, and, battle, of, the, philippine, sea, the, engagements, between, battleships, and, cruisers, such, as, the, battle, of, savo, island, and, the, naval, battle, of, guadalcanal, were, limited, to, night, time, actions, in, order, to, avoid, exposure, to, air, attacks, nevertheless, battleships, played, the, key, role, again, in, the, battle, of, leyte, gulf, even, though, it, happened, after, the, major, carrier, battles, mainly, because, the, japanese, carrier, fleet, was, by, then, essentially, depleted, it, was, the, last, naval, battle, between, battleships, in, history, air, power, remained, key, to, navies, throughout, the, 20th, century, moving, to, jets, launched, from, ever, larger, carriers, and, augmented, by, cruisers, armed, with, guided, missiles, and, cruise, missiles, roughly, parallel, to, the, development, of, naval, aviation, was, the, development, of, submarines, to, attack, underneath, the, surface, at, first, the, ships, were, capable, of, only, short, dives, but, they, eventually, developed, the, capability, to, spend, weeks, or, months, underwater, powered, by, nuclear, reactors, in, both, world, wars, submarines, u, boats, in, germany, primarily, exerted, their, power, by, using, torpedoes, to, sink, merchant, ships, and, other, warships, in, the, 1950s, the, cold, war, inspired, the, development, of, ballistic, missile, submarines, each, loaded, with, dozens, of, thermonuclear, weapon, armed, slbms, and, with, orders, to, launch, them, from, sea, if, the, other, nation, attacked, against, the, backdrop, of, those, developments, world, war, ii, had, seen, the, united, states, become, the, world, s, dominant, sea, power, throughout, the, rest, of, the, 20th, century, the, united, states, navy, maintained, a, tonnage, greater, than, that, of, the, next, 17, largest, navies, combined, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, saw, naval, gunnery, supplanted, by, ship, to, ship, missiles, as, the, primary, weapon, of, surface, combatants, two, major, naval, battles, have, taken, place, since, world, war, ii, the, indo, pakistani, naval, war, of, 1971, was, the, first, major, naval, war, post, world, war, ii, it, saw, the, dispatch, of, an, indian, aircraft, carrier, group, heavy, utilisation, of, missile, boats, in, naval, operations, total, naval, blockade, of, pakistan, by, the, indian, navy, and, the, annihilation, of, almost, half, of, pakistan, s, navy, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, damage, inflicted, by, the, indian, navy, and, air, forces, on, pakistan, s, navy, stood, at, two, destroyers, one, submarine,

badly, damaged, and, a, breguet, aliz, naval, aircraft, was, shot, down, by, the, pakistan, air, force, in, the, 1982, falklands, war, between, argentina, and, the, united, kingdom, a, royal, navy, task, force, of, approximately, 100, ships, was, dispatched, over, 7, 000, miles, 11, 000, km, from, the, british, mainland, to, the, south, atlantic, the, british, were, outnumbered, in, theatre, airpower, with, only, 36, harriers, from, their, two, aircraft, carriers, and, a, few, helicopters, compared, with, at, least, 200, aircraft, of, the, fuerza, a, rea, argentina, although, london, dispatched, vulcan, bombers, in, a, display, of, long, distance, strategic, capacity, most, of, the, land, based, aircraft, of, the, royal, air, force, were, not, available, due, to, the, distance, from, air, bases, this, reliance, on, aircraft, at, sea, showed, the, importance, of, the, aircraft, carrier, the, falklands, war, showed, the, vulnerability, of, modern, ships, to, sea, skimming,

construction, materials, were, learnt, from, the, conflict, at, the, present, time, large, naval, wars, are, seldom, seen, affairs, since, nations, with, substantial, navies, rarely, fight, each, other, most, wars, are, civil, wars, or, some, form, of, asymmetrical, warfare, fought, on, land, sometimes, with, the, involvement, of, military, aircraft, the, main, function, of, the, modern, navy, is, to, exploit, its, control, of, the, seaways, to, project, power, ashore, power, projection, has, been, the, primary, naval, feature, of, most, late, century, conflicts, including, the, korean, war, suez, crisis, vietnam, war, konfrontasi, gulf, war, kosovo, war, the, war, on, terrorism, in, afghanistan, and, the, iraq, war, a, major, exception, to, that, trend, was, the, sri, lankan, civil, war, which, saw, a, large, number, of, surface, engagements, between, the, belligerents, involving, fast, attack, craft, and, other, littoral, warfare, units, the, lack, of, large, fleet, on, fleet,
