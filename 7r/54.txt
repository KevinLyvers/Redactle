created, an, effective, advertising, campaign, for, the, company, products, which, involved, the, use, of, targeted, slogans, images, and, phrases, one, of, his, slogans, good, morning, have, you,

making, her, the, first, celebrity, to, endorse, a, commercial, product, becoming, the, company, s, brand, manager, in, 1865, listed, as, the, first, of, its, kind, by, the, guinness, book, of, records, barratt, introduced, many, of, the, crucial, ideas, that, lie, behind, successful, advertising, and, these, were, widely, circulated, in, his, day, he, constantly, stressed, the, importance, of, a, strong, and, exclusive, brand, image, for, pears, and, of, emphasizing, the, product, s, availability, through, saturation, campaigns, he, also, understood, the, importance, of, constantly, reevaluating, the, market, for, changing, tastes, and, mores, stating, in, 1907, that, tastes, change, fashions, change, and, the, advertiser, has, to, change, with, them, an, idea, that, was, effective, a, generation, ago, would, fall, flat, stale, and, unprofitable, if, presented, to, the, public, today, not, that, the, idea, of, today, is, always, better, than, the, older, idea, but, it, is, different, it, hits, the, present, taste, enhanced, advertising, revenues, was, one, effect, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, britain, thanks, to, the, revolution, and, the, consumers, it, created, by, the, mid, 19th, century, biscuits, and, chocolate, became, products, for, the, masses, and, british, biscuit, manufacturers, were, among, the, first, to, introduce, branding, to, distinguish, grocery, products, one, the, world, s, first, global, brands, huntley, palmers, biscuits, were, sold, in, 172, countries, in, 1900, and, their, global, reach, was, reflected, in, their, advertisements, as, a, result, of, massive, industrialization, advertising, increased, dramatically, in, the, united, states, in, 1919, it, was, 2, 5, percent, of, gross, domestic, product, gdp, in, the, us, and, it, averaged, 2, 2, percent, of, gdp, between, then, and, at, least, 2007, though, it, may, have, declined, dramatically, since, the, great, recession, industry, could, not, benefit, from, its, increased, productivity, without, a, substantial, increase, in, consumer, spending, this, contributed, to, the, development, of, mass, marketing, designed, to, influence, the, population, s, economic, behavior, on, a, larger, scale, in, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, advertisers, in, the, u, s, adopted, the, doctrine, that, human, instincts, could, be, targeted, and, harnessed, sublimated, into, the, desire, to, purchase, commodities, edward, bernays, a, nephew, of, sigmund, freud, became, associated, with, the, method, and, is, sometimes, called, the, founder, of, modern, advertising, and, public, relations, bernays, claimed, that, general, principle, that, men, are, very, largely, actuated, by, motives, which, they, conceal, from, themselves, is, as, true, of, mass, as, of, individual, psychology, it, is, evident, that, the, successful, propagandist, must, understand, the, true, motives, and, not, be, content, to, accept, the, reasons, which, men, give, for, what, they, do, in, other, words, selling, products, by, appealing, to, the, rational, minds, of, customers, the, main, method, used, prior, to, bernays, was, much, less, effective, than, selling, products, based, on, the, unconscious, desires, that, bernays, felt, were, the, true, motivators, of, human, action, sex, sells, became, a, controversial, issue, with, techniques, for, titillating, and, enlarging, the, audience, posing, a, challenge, to, conventional, morality, in, the, 1920s, under, secretary, of, commerce, herbert, hoover, the, american, government, promoted, advertising, hoover, himself, delivered, an, address, to, the, associated, advertising, clubs, of, the, world, in, 1925, called, advertising, is, a, vital, force, in, our, national, life, in, october, 1929, the, head, of, the, u, s, bureau, of, foreign, and, domestic, commerce, julius, klein, stated, advertising, is, the, key, to, world, prosperity, this, was, part, of, the, unparalleled, collaboration, between, business, and, government, in, the, 1920s, according, to, a, 1933, european, economic, journal, the, tobacco, companies, became, major, advertisers, in, order, to, sell, packaged, cigarettes, the, tobacco, companies, pioneered, the, new, advertising, techniques, when, they, hired, bernays, to, create, positive, associations, with, tobacco, smoking, advertising, was, also, used, as, a, vehicle, for, cultural, assimilation, encouraging, workers, to, exchange, their, traditional, habits, and, community, structure, in, favor, of, a, shared, modern, lifestyle, an, important, tool, for, influencing, immigrant, workers, was, the, american, association, of, foreign, language, newspapers, aafln, the, aafln, was, primarily, an, advertising, agency, but, also, gained, heavily, centralized, control, over, much, of, the, immigrant, press, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, advertising, was, one, of, the, few, career, choices, for, women, since, women, were, responsible, for, most, household, purchasing, done, advertisers, and, agencies, recognized, the, value, of, women, s, insight, during, the, creative, process, in, fact, the, first, american, advertising, to, use, a, sexual, sell, was, created, by, a, woman, for, a, soap, product, although, tame, by, today, s, standards, the, advertisement, featured, a, couple, with, the, message, a, skin, you, love, to, touch, in, the, 1920s, psychologists, walter, d, scott, and, john, b, watson, contributed, applied, psychological, theory, to, the, field, of, advertising, scott, said, man, has, been, called, the, reasoning, animal, but, he, could, with, greater, truthfulness, be, called, the, creature, of, suggestion, he, is, reasonable, but, he, is, to, a, greater, extent, suggestible, he, demonstrated, this, through, his, advertising, technique, of, a, direct, command, to, the, consumer, in, the, early, 1920s, the, first, radio, stations, were, established, by, radio, equipment, manufacturers, followed, by, non, profit, organizations, such, as, schools, clubs, and, civic, groups, who, also, set, up, their, own, stations, retailer, and, consumer, goods, manufacturers, quickly, recognized, radio, s, potential, to, reach, consumers, in, their, home, and, soon, adopted, advertising, techniques, that, would, allow, their, messages, to, stand, out, slogans, mascots, and, jingles, began, to, appear, on, radio, in, the, 1920s, and, early, television, in, the, 1930s, the, rise, of, mass, media, communications, allowed, manufacturers, of, branded, goods, to, bypass, retailers, by, advertising, directly, to, consumers, this, was, a, major, paradigm, shift, which, forced, manufacturers, to, focus, on, the, brand, and, stimulated, the, need, for, superior, insights, into, consumer, purchasing, consumption, and, usage, behavior, their, needs, wants, and, aspirations, the, earliest, radio, drama, series, were, sponsored, by, soap, manufacturers, and, the, genre, became, known, as, a, soap, opera, before, long, radio, station, owners, realized, they, could, increase, advertising, revenue, by, selling, air, time, in, small, time, allocations, which, could, be, sold, to, multiple, businesses, by, the, 1930s, these, advertising, spots, as, the, packets, of, time, became, known, were, being, sold, by, the, station, s, geographical, sales, representatives, ushering, in, an, era, of, national, radio, advertising, by, the, 1940s, manufacturers, began, to, recognize, the, way, in, which, consumers, were, developing, personal, relationships, with, their, brands, in, a, social, psychological, anthropological, sense, advertisers, began, to, use, motivational, research, and, consumer, research, to, gather, insights, into, consumer, purchasing, strong, branded, campaigns, for, chrysler, and, exxon, esso, using, insights, drawn, research, methods, from, psychology, and, cultural, anthropology, led, to, some, of, the, most, enduring, campaigns, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, early, 1950s, the, dumont, television, network, began, the, modern, practice, of, selling, advertisement, time, to, multiple, sponsors, previously, dumont, had, trouble, finding, sponsors, for, many, of, their, programs, and, compensated, by, selling, smaller, blocks, of, advertising, time, to, several, businesses, this, eventually, became, the, standard, for, the, commercial, television, industry, in, the, united, states, however, it, was, still, a, common, practice, to, have, single, sponsor, shows, such, as, the, united, states, steel, hour, in, some, instances, the, sponsors, exercised, great, control, over, the, content, of, the, show, up, to, and, including, having, one, s, advertising, agency, actually, writing, the, show, the, single, sponsor, model, is, much, less, prevalent, now, a, notable, exception, being, the, hallmark, hall, of, fame, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, saw, the, introduction, of, cable, television, and, particularly, mtv, pioneering, the, concept, of, the, music, video, mtv, ushered, in, a, new, type, of, advertising, the, consumer, tunes, in, for, the, advertising, message, rather, than, it, being, a, by, product, or, afterthought, as, cable, and, satellite, television, became, increasingly, prevalent, specialty, channels, emerged, including, channels, entirely, devoted, to, advertising, such, as, qvc, home, shopping, network, and, shoptv, canada, with, the, advent, of, the, ad, server, online, advertising, grew, contributing, to, the, dot, com, boom, of, the, 1990s, entire, corporations, operated, solely, on, advertising, revenue, offering, everything, from, coupons, to, free, internet, access, at, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, some, websites, including, the, search, engine, google, changed, online, advertising, by, personalizing, ads, based, on, web, browsing, behavior, this, has, led, to, other, similar, efforts, and, an, increase, in, interactive, advertising, online, advertising, introduced, new, opportunities, for, targeting, and, engagement, with, platforms, like, google, and, facebook, leading, the, charge, this, shift, has, significantly, altered, the, advertising, landscape, making, digital, advertising, a, dominant, force, in, the, industry, the, share, of, advertising, spending, relative, to, gdp, has, changed, little, across, large, changes, in, media, since, 1925, in, 1925, the, main, advertising, media, in, america, were, newspapers, magazines, signs, on, streetcars, and, outdoor, posters, advertising, spending, as, a, share, of, gdp, was, about, 2, 9, percent, by, 1998, television, and, radio, had, become, major, advertising, media, by, 2017, the, balance, between, broadcast, and, online, advertising, had, shifted, with, online, spending, exceeding, broadcast, nonetheless, advertising, spending, as, a, share, of, gdp, was, slightly, lower, about, 2, 4, percent, guerrilla, marketing, involves, unusual, approaches, such, as, staged, encounters, in, public, places, giveaways, of, products, such, as, cars, that, are, covered, with, brand, messages, and, interactive, advertising, where, the, viewer, can, respond, to, become, part, of, the, advertising, message, this, type, of, advertising, is, unpredictable, which, causes, consumers, to, buy, the, product, or, idea, this, reflects, an, increasing, trend, of, interactive, and, embedded, ads, such, as, via, product, placement, having, consumers, vote, through, text, messages, and, various, campaigns, utilizing, social, network, services, such, as, facebook, or, twitter,

watch, it, later, or, show, a, friend, in, general, the, advertising, community, has, not, yet, made, this, easy, although, some, have, used, the, internet, to, widely, distribute, their, ads, to, anyone, willing, to, see, or, hear, them, in, the, last, three, quarters, of, 2009, mobile, and, internet, advertising, grew, by, 18, and, 9, respectively, while, older, media, advertising, saw, declines, 10, 1, tv, 11, 7, radio, 14, 8, magazines, and, 18, 7, newspapers, between, 2008, and, 2014, u, s, newspapers, lost, more, than, half, their, print, advertising, revenue, another, significant, trend, regarding, future, of, advertising, is, the, growing, importance, of, the, niche, market, using, niche, or, targeted, ads, also, brought, about, by, the, internet, and, the, theory, of, the, long, tail, advertisers, will, have, an, increasing, ability, to, reach, specific, audiences, in, the, past, the, most, efficient, way, to, deliver, a, message, was, to, blanket, the, largest, mass, market, audience, possible, however, usage, tracking, customer, profiles, and, the, growing, popularity, of, niche, content, brought, about, by, everything, from, blogs, to, social, networking, sites, provide, advertisers, with, audiences, that, are, smaller, but, much, better, defined, leading, to, ads, that, are, more, relevant, to, viewers, and, more, effective, for, companies, marketing, products, among, others, comcast, spotlight, is, one, such, advertiser, employing, this, method, in, their, video, on, demand, menus, these, advertisements, are, targeted, to, a, specific, group, and, can, be, viewed, by, anyone, wishing, to, find, out, more, about, a, particular, business, or, practice, from, their, home, this, causes, the, viewer, to, become, proactive, and, actually, choose, what, advertisements, they, want, to, view, niche, marketing, could, also, be, helped, by, bringing, the, issue, of, color, into, advertisements, different, colors, play, major, roles, when, it, comes, to, marketing, strategies, for, example, seeing, the, blue, can, promote, a, sense, of, calmness, and, gives, a, sense, of, security, which, is, why, many, social, networks, such, as, facebook, use, blue, in, their, logos, google, adsense, is, an, example, of, niche, marketing, google, calculates, the, primary, purpose, of, a, website, and, adjusts, ads, accordingly, it, uses, keywords, on, the, page, or, even, in, emails, to, find, the, general, ideas, of, topics, disused, and, places, ads, that, will, most, likely, be, clicked, on, by, viewers, of, the, email, account, or, website, visitors, the, concept, of, crowdsourcing, has, given, way, to, the, trend, of, user, generated, advertisements, user, generated, ads, are, created, by, people, as, opposed, to, an, advertising, agency, or, the, company, themselves, often, resulting, from, brand, sponsored, advertising, competitions, for, the, 2007, super, bowl, the, frito, lays, division, of, pepsico, held, the, crash, the, super, bowl, contest, allowing, people, to, create, their, own, doritos, commercials, chevrolet, held, a, similar, competition, for, their, tahoe, line, of, suvs, due, to, the, success, of, the, doritos, user, generated, ads, in, the, 2007, super, bowl, frito, lays, relaunched, the, competition, for, the, 2009, and, 2010, super, bowl, the, resulting, ads, were, among, the, most, watched, and, most, liked, super, bowl, ads, in, fact, the, winning, ad, that, aired, in, the, 2009, super, bowl, was, ranked, by, the, usa, today, super, bowl, ad, meter, as, the, top, ad, for, the, year, while, the, winning, ads, that, aired, in, the, 2010, super, bowl, were, found, by, nielsen, s, buzzmetrics, to, be, the, most, buzzed, about, another, example, of, companies, using, crowdsourcing, successfully, is, the, beverage, company, jones, soda, that, encourages, consumers, to, participate, in, the, label, design, themselves, this, trend, has, given, rise, to, several, online, platforms, that, host, user, generated, advertising, competitions, on, behalf, of, a, company, founded, in, 2007, zooppa, has, launched, ad, competitions, for, brands, such, as, google, nike, hershey, s, general, mills, microsoft, nbc, universal, zinio, and, mini, cooper, crowdsourcing, remains, controversial, as, the, long, term, impact, on, the, advertising, industry, is, still, unclear, advertising, has, gone, through, five, major, stages, of, development, domestic, export, international, multi, national, and, global, for, global, advertisers, there, are, four, potentially, competing, business, objectives, that, must, be, balanced, when, developing, worldwide, advertising, building, a, brand, while, speaking, with, one, voice, developing, economies, of, scale, in, the, creative, process, maximizing, local, effectiveness, of, ads, and, increasing, the, company, s, speed, of, implementation, born, from, the, evolutionary, stages, of, global, marketing, are, the, three, primary, and, fundamentally, different, approaches, to, the, development, of, global, advertising, executions, exporting, executions, producing, local, executions, and, importing, ideas, that, travel, advertising, research, is, key, to, determining, the, success, of, an, ad, in, any, country, or, region, the, ability, to, identify, which, elements, and, or, moments, of, an, ad, contribute, to, its, success, is, how, economies, of, scale, are, maximized, once, one, knows, what, works, in, an, ad, that, idea, or, ideas, can, be, imported, by, any, other, market, market, research, measures, such, as, flow, of, attention, flow, of, emotion, and, branding, moments, provide, insight, into, what, is, working, in, an, ad, in, any, country, or, region, because, the, measures, are, based, on, the, visual, not, verbal, elements, of, the, ad, foreign, governments, particularly, those, that, own, marketable, commercial, products, or, services, often, promote, their, interests, and, positions, through, the, advertising, of, those, goods, because, the, target, audience, is, not, only, largely, unaware, of, the, forum, as, a, vehicle, for, foreign, messaging, but, also, willing, to, receive, the, message, while, in, a, mental, state, of, absorbing, information, from, advertisements, during, television, commercial, breaks, while, reading, a, periodical, or, while, passing, by, billboards, in, public, spaces, a, prime, example, of, this, messaging, technique, is, advertising, campaigns, to, promote, international, travel, while, advertising, foreign, destinations, and, services, may, stem, from, the, typical, goal, of, increasing, revenue, by, drawing, more, tourism, some, travel, campaigns, carry, the, additional, or, alternative, intended, purpose, of, promoting, good, sentiments, or, improving, existing, ones, among, the, target, audience, towards, a, given, nation, or, region, it, is, common, for, advertising, promoting, foreign, countries, to, be, produced, and, distributed, by, the, tourism, ministries, of, those, countries, so, these, ads, often, carry, political, statements, and, or, depictions, of, the, foreign, government, s, desired, international, public, perception, additionally, a, wide, range, of, foreign, airlines, and, travel, related, services, which, advertise, separately, from, the, destinations, themselves, are, owned, by, their, respective, governments, examples, include, though, are, not, limited, to, the, emirates, airline, dubai, singapore, airlines, singapore, qatar, airways, qatar, china, airlines, taiwan, republic, of, china, and, air, china, people, s, republic, of, china, by, depicting, their, destinations, airlines, and, other, services, in, a, favorable, and, pleasant, light, countries, market, themselves, to, populations, abroad, in, a, manner, that, could, mitigate, prior, public, impressions, in, the, realm, of, advertising, agencies, continued, industry, diversification, has, seen, observers, note, that, big, global, clients, don, t, need, big, global, agencies, any, more, this, is, reflected, by, the, growth, of, non, traditional, agencies, in, various, global, markets, such, as, canadian, business, taxi, and, smart, in, australia, and, has, been, referred, to, as, a, revolution, in, the, ad, world, the, ability, to, record, shows, on, digital, video, recorders, such, as, tivo, allow, watchers, to, record, the, programs, for, later, viewing, enabling, them, to, fast, forward, through, commercials, additionally, as, more, seasons, of, pre, recorded, box, sets, are, offered, for, sale, of, television, programs, fewer, people, watch, the, shows, on, tv, however, the, fact, that, these, sets, are, sold, means, the, company, will, receive, additional, profits, from, these, sets, to, counter, this, effect, a, variety, of, strategies, have, been, employed, many, advertisers, have, opted, for, product, placement, on, tv, shows, like, survivor, other, strategies, include, integrating, advertising, with, internet, connected, program, guidess, epgs, advertising, on, companion, devices, like, smartphones, and, tablets, during, the, show, and, creating, mobile, apps, for, tv, programs, additionally, some, like, brands, have, opted, for, social, television, sponsorship, the, emerging, technology, of, drone, displays, has, recently, been, used, for, advertising, purposes, in, recent, years, there, have, been, several, media, literacy, initiatives, and, more, specifically, concerning, advertising, that, seek, to, empower, citizens, in, the, face, of, media, advertising, campaigns, advertising, education, has, become, popular, with, bachelor, master, and, doctorate, degrees, becoming, available, in, the, emphasis, a, surge, in, advertising, interest, is, typically, attributed, to, the, strong, relationship, advertising, plays, in, cultural, and, technological, changes, such, as, the, advance, of, online, social, networking, a, unique, model, for, teaching, advertising, is, the, student, run, advertising, agency, where, advertising, students, create, campaigns, for, real, companies, organizations, such, as, the, american, advertising, federation, establish, companies, with, students, to, create, these, campaigns, advertising, is, at, the, front, of, delivering, the, proper, message, to, customers, and, prospective, customers, the, purpose, of, advertising, is, to, inform, the, consumers, about, their, product, and, convince, customers, that, a, company, s, services, or, products, are, the, best, enhance, the, image, of, the, company, point, out, and, create, a, need, for, products, or, services, demonstrate, new, uses, for, established, products, announce, new, products, and, programs, reinforce, the, salespeople, s, individual, messages, draw, customers, to, the, business, and, to, hold, existing, customers, sales, promotions, are, another, way, to, advertise, sales, promotions, are, double, purposed, because, they, are, used, to, gather, information, about, what, type, of, customers, one, draws, in, and, where, they, are, and, to, jump, start, sales, sales, promotions, include, things, like, contests, and, games, sweepstakes, product, giveaways, samples, coupons, loyalty, programs, and, discounts, the, ultimate, goal, of, sales, promotions, is, to, stimulate, potential, customers, to, action, while, advertising, can, be, seen, as, necessary, for, economic, growth, it, is, not, without, social, costs, unsolicited, commercial, e, mail, and, other, forms, of, spam, have, become, so, prevalent, as, to, have, become, a, major, nuisance, to, users, of, these, services, as, well, as, being, a, financial, burden, on, internet, service, providers, advertising, is, increasingly, invading, public, spaces, such, as, schools, which, some, critics, argue, is, a, form, of, child, exploitation, this, increasing, difficulty, in, limiting, exposure, to, specific, audiences, can, result, in, negative, backlash, for, advertisers, in, tandem, with, these, criticisms, the, advertising, industry, has, seen, low, approval, rates, in, surveys, and, negative, cultural, portrayals, a, 2021, study, found, that, for, more, than, 80, of, brands, advertising, had, a, negative, return, on, investment, unsolicited, ads, have, been, criticized, as, attention, theft, one, of, the, most, controversial, criticisms, of, advertisement, in, the, present, day, is, that, of, the, predominance, of, advertising, of, foods, high, in, sugar, fat, and, salt, specifically, to, children, critics, claim, that, food, advertisements, targeting, children, are, exploitive, and, are, not, sufficiently, balanced, with, proper, nutritional, education, to, help, children, understand, the, consequences, of, their, food, choices, additionally, children, may, not, understand, that, they, are, being, sold, something, and, are, therefore, more, impressionable, michelle, obama, has, criticized, large, food, companies, for, advertising, unhealthy, foods, largely, towards, children, and, has, requested, that, food, companies, either, limit, their, advertising, to, children, or, advertise, foods, that, are, more, in, line, with, dietary, guidelines, the, other, criticisms, include, the, change, that, are, brought, by, those, advertisements, on, the, society, and, also, the, deceiving, ads, that, are, aired, and, published, by, the, corporations, cosmetic, and, health, industry, are, the, ones, which, exploited, the, highest, and, created, reasons, of, concern, political, advertisement, and, their, regulations, have, been, scrutinized, for, misinformation, ethics, and, political, bias, there, have, been, increasing, efforts, to, protect, the, public, interest, by, regulating, the, content, and, the, influence, of, advertising, some, examples, include, restrictions, for, advertising, alcohol, tobacco, or, gambling, imposed, in, many, countries, as, well, as, the, bans, around, advertising, to, children, which, exist, in, parts, of, europe, advertising, regulation, focuses, heavily, on, the, veracity, of, the, claims, and, as, such, there, are, often, tighter, restrictions, placed, around, advertisements, for, food, and, healthcare, products, the, advertising, industries, within, some, countries, rely, less, on, laws, and, more, on, systems, of, self, regulation, advertisers, and, the, media, agree, on, a, code, of, advertising, standards, that, they, attempt, to, uphold, the, general, aim, of, such, codes, is, to, ensure, that, any, advertising, is, legal, decent, honest, and, truthful, some, self, regulatory, organizations, are, funded, by, the, industry, but, remain, independent, with, the, intent, of, upholding, the, standards, or, codes, like, the, advertising, standards, authority, in, the, uk, in, the, uk, most, forms, of, outdoor, advertising, such, as, the, display, of, billboards, is, regulated, by, the, uk, town, and, county, planning, system, currently, the, display, of, an, advertisement, without, consent, from, the, planning, authority, is, a, criminal, offense, liable, to, a, fine, of, 2, 500, per, offense, in, the, us, many, communities, believe, that, many, forms, of, outdoor, advertising, blight, the, public, realm, as, long, ago, as, the, 1960s, in, the, us, there, were, attempts, to, ban, billboard, advertising, in, the, open, countryside, cities, such, as, s, o, paulo, have, introduced, an, outright, ban, with, london, also, having, specific, legislation, to, control, unlawful, displays, some, governments, restrict, the, languages, that, can, be, used, in, advertisements, but, advertisers, may, employ, tricks, to, try, avoiding, them, in, france, for, instance, advertisers, sometimes, print, english, words, in, bold, and, french, translations, in, fine, print, to, deal, with, article, 120, of, the, 1994, toubon, law, limiting, the, use, of, english, the, advertising, of, pricing, information, is, another, topic, of, concern, for, governments, in, the, united, states, for, instance, it, is, common, for, businesses, to, only, mention, the, existence, and, amount, of, applicable, taxes, at, a, later, stage, of, a, transaction, in, canada, and, new, zealand, taxes, can, be, listed, as, separate, items, as, long, as, they, are, quoted, up, front, in, most, other, countries, the, advertised, price, must, include, all, applicable, taxes, enabling, customers, to, easily, know, how, much, it, will, cost, them, various, competing, models, of, hierarchies, of, effects, attempt, to, provide, a, theoretical, underpinning, to, advertising, practice, the, marketing, mix, was, proposed, by, professor, e, jerome, mccarthy, in, the, 1960s, it, consists, of, four, basic, elements, called, the, four, ps, product, is, the, first, p, representing, the, actual, product, price, represents, the, process, of, determining, the, value, of, a, product, place, represents, the, variables, of, getting, the, product, to, the, consumer, such, as, distribution, channels, market, coverage, and, movement, organization, the, last, p, stands, for, promotion, which, is, the, process, of, reaching, the, target, market, and, convincing, them, to, buy, the, product, in, the, 1990s, the, concept, of, four, cs, was, introduced, as, a, more, customer, driven, replacement, of, four, p, s, there, are, two, theories, based, on, four, cs, lauterborn, s, four, cs, consumer, cost, communication, convenience, and, shimizu, s, four, cs, commodity, cost, communication, channel, in, the, 7cs, compass, model, co, marketing, communications, can, include, advertising, sales, promotion, public, relations, publicity, personal, selling, corporate, identity, internal, communication, sns, and, mis, advertising, research, is, a, specialized, form, of, research, that, works, to, improve, the, effectiveness, and, efficiency, of, advertising, it, entails, numerous, forms, of, research, which, employ, different, methodologies, advertising, research, includes, pre, testing, also, known, as, copy, testing, and, post, testing, of, ads, and, or, campaigns, pre, testing, includes, a, wide, range, of, qualitative, and, quantitative, techniques, including, focus, groups, in, depth, target, audience, interviews, one, on, one, interviews, small, scale, quantitative, studies, and, physiological, measurement, the, goal, of, these, investigations, is, to, better, understand, how, different, groups, respond, to, various, messages, and, visual, prompts, thereby, providing, an, assessment, of, how, well, the, advertisement, meets, its, communications, goals, post, testing, employs, many, of, the, same, techniques, as, pre, testing, usually, with, a, focus, on, understanding, the, change, in, awareness, or, attitude, attributable, to, the, advertisement, with, the, emergence, of, digital, advertising, technologies, many, firms, have, begun, to, continuously, post, test, ads, using, real, time, data, this, may, take, the, form, of, a, b, split, testing, or, multivariate, testing, continuous, ad, tracking, and, the, communicus, system, are, competing, examples, of, post, testing, advertising, research, types, meanings, between, consumers, and, marketers, depict, signs, and, symbols, that, are, encoded, in, everyday, objects, semiotics, is, the, study, of, signs, and, how, they, are, interpreted, advertising, has, many, hidden, signs, and, meanings, within, brand, names, logos, package, designs, print, advertisements, and, television, advertisements, semiotics, aims, to, study, and, interpret, the, message, being, conveyed, in, for, example, advertisements, logos, and, advertisements, can, be, interpreted, at, two, levels, known, as, the, surface, level, and, the, underlying, level, the, surface, level, uses, signs, creatively, to, create, an, image, or, personality, for, a, product, these, signs, can, be, images, words, fonts, colors, or, slogans, the, underlying, level, is, made, up, of, hidden, meanings, the, combination, of, images, words, colors, and, slogans, must, be, interpreted, by, the, audience, or, consumer, the, key, to, advertising, analysis, is, the, signifier, and, the, signified, the, signifier, is, the, object, and, the, signified, is, the, mental, concept, a, product, has, a, signifier, and, a, signified, the, signifier, is, the, color, brand, name, logo, design, and, technology, the, signified, has, two, meanings, known, as, denotative, and, connotative, the, denotative, meaning, is, the, meaning, of, the, product, a, television, s, denotative, meaning, might, be, that, it, is, high, definition, the, connotative, meaning, is, the, product, s, deep, and, hidden, meaning, a, connotative, meaning, of, a, television, would, be, that, it, is, top, of, the, line, apple, s, commercials, used, a, black, silhouette, of, a, person, that, was, the, age, of, apple, s, target, market, they, placed, the, silhouette, in, front, of, a, blue, screen, so, that, the, picture, behind, the, silhouette, could, be, constantly, changing, however, the, one, thing, that, stays, the, same, in, these, ads, is, that, there, is, music, in, the, background, and, the, silhouette, is, listening, to, that, music, on, a, white, ipod, through, white, headphones, through, advertising, the, white, color, on, a, set, of, earphones, now, signifies, that, the, music, device, is, an, ipod, the, white, color, signifies, almost, all, of, apple, s, products, the, semiotics, of, gender, plays, a, key, influence, on, the, way, in, which, signs, are, interpreted, when, considering, gender, roles, in, advertising, individuals, are, influenced, by, three, categories, certain, characteristics, of, stimuli, may, enhance, or, decrease, the, elaboration, of, the, message, if, the, product, is, perceived, as, feminine, or, masculine, second, the, characteristics, of, individuals, can, affect, attention, and, elaboration, of, the, message, traditional, or, non, traditional, gender, role, orientation, lastly, situational, factors, may, be, important, to, influence, the, elaboration, of, the, message, there, are, two, types, of, marketing, communication, claims, objective, and, subjective, objective, claims, stem, from, the, extent, to, which, the, claim, associates, the, brand, with, a, tangible, product, or, service, feature, for, instance, a, camera, may, have, auto, focus, features, subjective, claims, convey, emotional, subjective, impressions, of, intangible, aspects, of, a, product, or, service, they, are, non, physical, features, of, a, product, or, service, that, cannot, be, directly, perceived, as, they, have, no, physical, reality, for, instance, the, brochure, has, a, beautiful, design, males, tend, to, respond, better, to, objective, marketing, communications, claims, while, females, tend, to, respond, better, to, subjective, marketing, communications, claims, voiceovers, are, commonly, used, in, advertising, most, voiceovers, are, done, by, men, with, figures, of, up, to, 94, having, been, reported, there, have, been, more, female, voiceovers, in, recent, years, but, mainly, for, food, household, products, and, feminine, care, products, according, to, a, 1977, study, by, david, statt, females, process, information, comprehensively, while, males, process, information, through, heuristic, devices, such, as, procedures, methods, or, strategies, for, solving, problems, which, could, have, an, effect, on, how, they, interpret, advertising, according, to, this, study, men, prefer, to, have, available, and, apparent, cues, to, interpret, the, message, whereas, females, engage, in, more, creative, associative, imagery, laced, interpretation, later, research, by, a, danish, team, found, that, advertising, attempts, to, persuade, men, to, improve, their, appearance, or, performance, whereas, its, approach, to, women, aims, at, transformation, toward, an, impossible, ideal, of, female, presentation, in, paul, suggett, s, article, the, objectification, of, women, in, advertising, he, discusses, the, negative, impact, that, these, women, in, advertisements, who, are, too, perfect, to, be, real, have, on, women, as, well, as, men, in, real, life, advertising, s, manipulation, of, women, s, aspiration, to, these, ideal, types, as, portrayed, in, film, in, erotic, art, in, advertising, on, stage, within, music, videos, and, through, other, media, exposures, requires, at, least, a, conditioned, rejection, of, female, reality, and, thereby, takes, on, a, highly, ideological, cast, studies, show, that, these, expectations, of, women, and, young, girls, negatively, affect, their, views, about, their, bodies, and, appearances, these, advertisements, are, directed, towards, men, not, everyone, agrees, one, critic, viewed, this, monologic, gender, specific, interpretation, of, advertising, as, excessively, skewed, and, politicized, there, are, some, companies, like, dove, and, aerie, that, are, creating, commercials, to, portray, more, natural, women, with, less, post, production, manipulation, so, more, women, and, young, girls, are, able, to, relate, to, them, more, recent, research, by, martin, 2003, reveals, that, males, and, females, differ, in, how, they, react, to, advertising, depending, on, their, mood, at, the, time, of, exposure, to, the, ads, and, on, the, affective, tone, of, the, advertising, when, feeling, sad, males, prefer, happy, ads, to, boost, their, mood, in, contrast, females, prefer, happy, ads, when, they, are, feeling, happy, the, television, programs, in, which, ads, are, embedded, influence, a, viewer, s, mood, state, susan, wojcicki, author, of, the, article, ads, that, empower, women, don, t, just, break, stereotypes, they, re, also, effective, discusses, how, advertising, to, women, has, changed, since, the, first, barbie, commercial, where, a, little, girl, tells, the, doll, that, she, wants, to, be, just, like, her, little, girls, grow, up, watching, advertisements, of, scantily, clad, women, advertising, things, from, trucks, to, burgers, and, wojcicki, states, that, this, shows, girls, that, they, are, either, arm, candy, or, eye, candy, other, approaches, to, revenue, include, donations, paid, subscriptions, microtransactions, and, data, monetization, websites, and, applications, are, ad, free, when, not, using, advertisements, at, all, for, revenue, for, example, the, online, encyclopedia, wikipedia, provides, free, content, by, receiving, funding, from, charitable, donations, notes
