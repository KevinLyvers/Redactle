or, injury, it, is, a, form, of, risk, management, primarily, used, to, protect, against, the, risk, of, a, contingent, or, uncertain, loss, an, entity, which, provides, insurance, is, known, as, an, insurer, insurance, company, insurance, carrier, or, underwriter, a, person, or, entity, who, buys, insurance, is, known, as, a, policyholder, while, a, person, or, entity, covered, under, the, policy, is, called, an, insured, the, insurance, transaction, involves, the, policyholder, assuming, a, guaranteed, known, and, relatively, small, loss, in, the, form, of, a, payment, to, the, insurer, a, premium, in, exchange, for, the, insurer, s, promise, to, compensate, the, insured, in, the, event, of, a, covered, loss, the, loss, may, or, may, not, be, financial, but, it, must, be, reducible, to, financial, terms, furthermore, it, usually, involves, something, in, which, the, insured, has, an, insurable, interest, established, by, ownership, possession, or, pre, existing, relationship, the, insured, receives, a, contract, called, the, insurance, policy, which, details, the, conditions, and, circumstances, under, which, the, insurer, will, compensate, the, insured, or, their, designated, beneficiary, or, assignee, the, amount, of, money, charged, by, the, insurer, to, the, policyholder, for, the, coverage, set, forth, in, the, insurance, policy, is, called, the, premium, if, the, insured, experiences, a, loss, which, is, potentially, covered, by, the, insurance, policy, the, insured, submits, a, claim, to, the, insurer, for, processing, by, a, claims, adjuster, a, mandatory, out, of, pocket, expense, required, by, an, insurance, policy, before, an, insurer, will, pay, a, claim, is, called, a, deductible, or, if, required, by, a, health, insurance, policy, a, copayment, the, insurer, may, hedge, its, own, risk, by, taking, out, reinsurance, whereby, another, insurance, company, agrees, to, carry, some, of, the, risks, especially, if, the, primary, insurer, deems, the, risk, too, large, for, it, to, carry, methods, for, transferring, or, distributing, risk, were, practiced, by, chinese, and, indian, traders, as, long, ago, as, the, 3rd,

contracts, were, invented, in, genoa, in, the, 14th, century, as, were, insurance, pools, backed, by, pledges, of, landed, estates, the, first, known, insurance, contract, dates, from, genoa, in, 1347, in, the, next, century, maritime, insurance, developed, widely, and, premiums, were, varied, with, risks, these, new, insurance, contracts, allowed, insurance, to, be, separated, from, investment, a, separation, of, roles, that, first, proved, useful, in, marine, insurance, the, earliest, known, policy, of, life, insurance, was, made, in, the, royal, exchange, london, on, the, 18th, of, june, 1583, for, 383, 6s, 8d, for, twelve, months, on, the, life, of, william, gibbons, insurance, became, far, more, sophisticated, in, enlightenment, era, europe, where, specialized, varieties, developed, property, insurance, as, we, know, it, today, can, be, traced, to, the, great, fire, of, london, which, in, 1666, devoured, more, than, 13, 000, houses, the, devastating, effects, of, the, fire, converted, the, development, of, insurance, from, a, matter, of, convenience, into, one, of, urgency, a, change, of, opinion, reflected, in, sir, christopher, wren, s, inclusion, of, a, site, for, the, insurance, office, in, his, new, plan, for, london, in, 1667, a, number, of, attempted, fire, insurance, schemes, came, to, nothing, but, in, 1681, economist, nicholas, barbon, and, eleven, associates, established, the, first, fire, insurance, company, the, insurance, office, for, houses, at, the, back, of, the, royal, exchange, to, insure, brick, and, frame, homes, initially, 5, 000, homes, were, insured, by, his, insurance, office, at, the, same, time, the, first, insurance, schemes, for, the, underwriting, of, business, ventures, became, available, by, the, end, of, the, seventeenth, century, london, s, growth, as, a, centre, for, trade, was, increasing, due, to, the, demand, for, marine, insurance, in, the, late, 1680s, edward, lloyd, opened, a, coffee, house, which, became, the, meeting, place, for, parties, in, the, shipping, industry, wishing, to, insure, cargoes, and, ships, including, those, willing, to, underwrite, such, ventures, these, informal, beginnings, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, insurance, market, lloyd, s, of, london, and, several, related, shipping, and, insurance, businesses, life, insurance, policies, were, taken, out, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, first, company, to, offer, life, insurance, was, the, amicable, society, for, a, perpetual, assurance, office, founded, in, london, in, 1706, by, william, talbot, and, sir, thomas, allen, upon, the, same, principle, edward, rowe, mores, established, the, society, for, equitable, assurances, on, lives, and, survivorship, in, 1762, it, was, the, world, s, first, mutual, insurer, and, it, pioneered, age, based, premiums, based, on, mortality, rate, laying, the, framework, for, scientific, insurance, practice, and, development, and, the, basis, of, modern, life, assurance, upon, which, all, life, assurance, schemes, were, subsequently, based, in, the, late, 19th, century, accident, insurance, began, to, become, available, the, first, company, to, offer, accident, insurance, was, the, railway, passengers, assurance, company, formed, in, 1848, in, england, to, insure, against, the, rising, number, of, fatalities, on, the, nascent, railway, system, the, first, international, insurance, rule, was, the, york, antwerp, rules, yar, for, the, distribution, of, costs, between, ship, and, cargo, in, the, event, of, general, average, in, 1873, the, association, for, the, reform, and, codification, of, the, law, of, nations, the, forerunner, of, the, international, law, association, ila, was, founded, in, brussels, it, published, the, first, yar, in, 1890, before, switching, to, the, present, title, of, the, international, law, association, in, 1895, by, the, late, 19th, century, governments, began, to, initiate, national, insurance, programs, against, sickness, and, old, age, germany, built, on, a, tradition, of, welfare, programs, in, prussia, and, saxony, that, began, as, early, as, in, the, 1840s, in, the, 1880s, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, introduced, old, age, pensions, accident, insurance, and, medical, care, that, formed, the, basis, for, germany, s, welfare, state, in, britain, more, extensive, legislation, was, introduced, by, the, liberal, government, in, the, national, insurance, act, 1911, this, gave, the, british, working, classes, the, first, contributory, system, of, insurance, against, illness, and, unemployment, this, system, was, greatly, expanded, after, the, second, world, war, under, the, influence, of, the, beveridge, report, to, form, the, first, modern, welfare, state, in, 2008, the, international, network, of, insurance, associations, inia, then, an, informal, network, became, active, and, it, has, been, succeeded, by, the, global, federation, of, insurance, associations, gfia, which, was, formally, founded, in, 2012, to, aim, to, increase, insurance, industry, effectiveness, in, providing, input, to, international, regulatory, bodies, and, to, contribute, more, effectively, to, the, international, dialogue, on, issues, of, common, interest, it, consists, of, its, 40, member, associations, and, 1, observer, association, in, 67, countries, which, companies, account, for, around, 89, of, total, insurance, premiums, worldwide, insurance, involves, pooling, funds, from, many, insured, entities, known, as, exposures, to, pay, for, the, losses, that, only, some, insureds, may, incur, the, insured, entities, are, therefore, protected, from, risk, for, a, fee, with, the, fee, being, dependent, upon, the, frequency, and, severity, of, the, event, occurring, in, order, to, be, an, insurable, risk, the, risk, insured, against, must, meet, certain, characteristics, insurance, as, a, financial, intermediary, is, a, commercial, enterprise, and, a, major, part, of, the, financial, services, industry, but, individual, entities, can, also, self, insure, through, saving, money, for, possible, future, losses, risk, which, can, be, insured, by, private, companies, typically, share, seven, common, characteristics, when, a, company, insures, an, individual, entity, there, are, basic, legal, requirements, and, regulations, several, commonly, cited, legal, principles, of, insurance, include, to, indemnify, means, to, make, whole, again, or, to, be, reinstated, to, the, position, that, one, was, in, to, the, extent, possible, prior, to, the, happening, of, a, specified, event, or, peril, accordingly, life, insurance, is, generally, not, considered, to, be, indemnity, insurance, but, rather, contingent, insurance, i, e, a, claim, arises, on, the, occurrence, of, a, specified, event, there, are, generally, three, types, of, insurance, contracts, that, seek, to, indemnify, an, insured, from, an, insured, s, standpoint, the, result, is, usually, the, same, the, insurer, pays, the, loss, and, claims, expenses, if, the, insured, has, a, reimbursement, policy, the, insured, can, be, required, to, pay, for, a, loss, and, then, be, reimbursed, by, the, insurance, carrier, for, the, loss, and, out, of, pocket, costs, including, with, the, permission, of, the, insurer, claim, expenses, under, a, pay, on, behalf, policy, the, insurance, carrier, would, defend, and, pay, a, claim, on, behalf, of, the, insured, who, would, not, be, out, of, pocket, for, anything, most, modern, liability, insurance, is, written, on, the, basis, of, pay, on, behalf, language, which, enables, the, insurance, carrier, to, manage, and, control, the, claim, under, an, indemnification, policy, the, insurance, carrier, can, generally, either, reimburse, or, pay, on, behalf, of, whichever, is, more, beneficial, to, it, and, the, insured, in, the, claim, handling, process, an, entity, seeking, to, transfer, risk, an, individual, corporation, or, association, of, any, type, etc, becomes, the, insured, party, once, risk, is, assumed, by, an, insurer, the, insuring, party, by, means, of, a, contract, called, an, insurance, policy, generally, an, insurance, contract, includes, at, a, minimum, the, following, elements, identification, of, participating, parties, the, insurer, the, insured, the, beneficiaries, the, premium, the, period, of, coverage, the, particular, loss, event, covered, the, amount, of, coverage, i, e, the, amount, to, be, paid, to, the, insured, or, beneficiary, in, the, event, of, a, loss, and, exclusions, events, not, covered, an, insured, is, thus, said, to, be, indemnified, against, the, loss, covered, in, the, policy, when, insured, parties, experience, a, loss, for, a, specified, peril, the, coverage, entitles, the, policyholder, to, make, a, claim, against, the, insurer, for, the, covered, amount, of, loss, as, specified, by, the, policy, the, fee, paid, by, the, insured, to, the, insurer, for, assuming, the, risk, is, called, the, premium, insurance, premiums, from, many, insureds, are, used, to, fund, accounts, reserved, for, later, payment, of, claims, in, theory, for, a, relatively, few, claimants, and, for, overhead, costs, so, long, as, an, insurer, maintains, adequate, funds, set, aside, for, anticipated, losses, called, reserves, the, remaining, margin, is, an, insurer, s, profit, policies, typically, include, a, number, of, exclusions, for, example, insurers, may, prohibit, certain, activities, which, are, considered, dangerous, and, therefore, excluded, from, coverage, one, system, for, classifying, activities, according, to, whether, they, are, authorised, by, insurers, refers, to, green, light, approved, activities, and, events, yellow, light, activities, and, events, which, require, insurer, consultation, and, or, waivers, of, liability, and, red, light, activities, and, events, which, are, prohibited, and, outside, the, scope, of, insurance, cover, insurance, can, have, various, effects, on, society, through, the, way, that, it, changes, who, bears, the, cost, of, losses, and, damage, on, one, hand, it, can, increase, fraud, on, the, other, it, can, help, societies, and, individuals, prepare, for, catastrophes, and, mitigate, the, effects, of, catastrophes, on, both, households, and, societies, insurance, can, influence, the, probability, of, losses, through, moral, hazard, insurance, fraud, and, preventive, steps, by, the, insurance, company, insurance, scholars, have, typically, used, moral, hazard, to, refer, to, the, increased, loss, due, to, unintentional, carelessness, and, insurance, fraud, to, refer, to, increased, risk, due, to, intentional, carelessness, or, indifference, insurers, attempt, to, address, carelessness, through, inspections, policy, provisions, requiring, certain, types, of, maintenance, and, possible, discounts, for, loss, mitigation, efforts, while, in, theory, insurers, could, encourage, investment, in, loss, reduction, some, commentators, have, argued, that, in, practice, insurers, had, historically, not, aggressively, pursued, loss, control, measures, particularly, to, prevent, disaster, losses, such, as, hurricanes, because, of, concerns, over, rate, reductions, and, legal, battles, however, since, about, 1996, insurers, have, begun, to, take, a, more, active, role, in, loss, mitigation, such, as, through, building, codes, according, to, the, study, books, of, the, chartered, insurance, institute, there, are, variant, methods, of, insurance, as, follows, insurers, may, use, the, subscription, business, model, collecting, premium, payments, periodically, in, return, for, on, going, and, or, compounding, benefits, offered, to, policyholders, insurers, business, model, aims, to, collect, more, in, premium, and, investment, income, than, is, paid, out, in, losses, and, to, also, offer, a, competitive, price, which, consumers, will, accept, profit, can, be, reduced, to, a, simple, equation, insurers, make, money, in, two, ways, the, most, complicated, aspect, of, insuring, is, the, actuarial, science, of, ratemaking, price, setting, of, policies, which, uses, statistics, and, probability, to, approximate, the, rate, of, future, claims, based, on, a, given, risk, after, producing, rates, the, insurer, will, use, discretion, to, reject, or, accept, risks, through, the, underwriting, process, at, the, most, basic, level, initial, rate, making, involves, looking, at, the, frequency, and, severity, of, insured, perils, and, the, expected, average, payout, resulting, from, these, perils, thereafter, an, insurance, company, will, collect, historical, loss, data, bring, the, loss, data, to, present, value, and, compare, these, prior, losses, to, the, premium, collected, in, order, to, assess, rate, adequacy, loss, ratios, and, expense, loads, are, also, used, rating, for, different, risk, characteristics, involves, at, the, most, basic, level, comparing, the, losses, with, loss, relativities, a, policy, with, twice, as, many, losses, would, therefore, be, charged, twice, as, much, more, complex, multivariate, analyses, are, sometimes, used, when, multiple, characteristics, are, involved, and, a, univariate, analysis, could, produce, confounded, results, other, statistical, methods, may, be, used, in, assessing, the, probability, of, future, losses, upon, termination, of, a, given, policy, the, amount, of, premium, collected, minus, the, amount, paid, out, in, claims, is, the, insurer, s, underwriting, profit, on, that, policy, underwriting, performance, is, measured, by, something, called, the, combined, ratio, which, is, the, ratio, of, expenses, losses, to, premiums, a, combined, ratio, of, less, than, 100, indicates, an, underwriting, profit, while, anything, over, 100, indicates, an, underwriting, loss, a, company, with, a, combined, ratio, over, 100, may, nevertheless, remain, profitable, due, to, investment, earnings, insurance, companies, earn, investment, profits, on, float, float, or, available, reserve, is, the, amount, of, money, on, hand, at, any, given, moment, that, an, insurer, has, collected, in, insurance, premiums, but, has, not, paid, out, in, claims, insurers, start, investing, insurance, premiums, as, soon, as, they, are, collected, and, continue, to, earn, interest, or, other, income, on, them, until, claims, are, paid, out, the, association, of, british, insurers, grouping, together, 400, insurance, companies, and, 94, of, uk, insurance, services, has, almost, 20, of, the, investments, in, the, london, stock, exchange, in, 2007, u, s, industry, profits, from, float, totaled, 58, billion, in, a, 2009, letter, to, investors, warren, buffett, wrote, we, were, paid, 2, 8,

but, overall, profit, for, the, same, period, was, 68, 4, billion, as, the, result, of, float, some, insurance, industry, insiders, most, notably, hank, greenberg, do, not, believe, that, it, is, possible, to, sustain, a, profit, from, float, forever, without, an, underwriting, profit, as, well, but, this, opinion, is, not, universally, held, reliance, on, float, for, profit, has, led, some, industry, experts, to, call, insurance, companies, investment, companies, that, raise, the, money, for, their, investments, by, selling, insurance, naturally, the, float, method, is, difficult, to, carry, out, in, an, economically, depressed, period, bear, markets, do, cause, insurers, to, shift, away, from, investments, and, to, toughen, up, their, underwriting, standards, so, a, poor, economy, generally, means, high, insurance, premiums, this, tendency, to, swing, between, profitable, and, unprofitable, periods, over, time, is, commonly, known, as, the, underwriting, or, insurance, cycle, claims, and, loss, handling, is, the, materialized, utility, of, insurance, it, is, the, actual, product, paid, for, claims, may, be, filed, by, insureds, directly, with, the, insurer, or, through, brokers, or, agents, the, insurer, may, require, that, the, claim, be, filed, on, its, own, proprietary, forms, or, may, accept, claims, on, a, standard, industry, form, such, as, those, produced, by, acord, insurance, company, claims, departments, employ, a, large, number, of, claims, adjusters, supported, by, a, staff, of, records, management, and, data, entry, clerks, incoming, claims, are, classified, based, on, severity, and, are, assigned, to, adjusters, whose, settlement, authority, varies, with, their, knowledge, and, experience, an, adjuster, undertakes, an, investigation, of, each, claim, usually, in, close, cooperation, with, the, insured, determines, if, coverage, is, available, under, the, terms, of, the, insurance, contract, and, if, so, the, reasonable, monetary, value, of, the, claim, and, authorizes, payment, policyholders, may, hire, their, own, public, adjusters, to, negotiate, settlements, with, the, insurance, company, on, their, behalf, for, policies, that, are, complicated, where, claims, may, be, complex, the, insured, may, take, out, a, separate, insurance, policy, add, on, called, loss, recovery, insurance, which, covers, the, cost, of, a, public, adjuster, in, the, case, of, a, claim, adjusting, liability, insurance, claims, is, particularly, difficult, because, they, involve, a, third, party, the, plaintiff, who, is, under, no, contractual, obligation, to, cooperate, with, the, insurer, and, may, in, fact, regard, the, insurer, as, a, deep, pocket, the, adjuster, must, obtain, legal, counsel, for, the, insured, either, inside, house, counsel, or, outside, panel, counsel, monitor, litigation, that, may, take, years, to, complete, and, appear, in, person, or, over, the, telephone, with, settlement, authority, at, a,

agents, to, initially, market, or, underwrite, their, customers, agents, can, be, captive, meaning, they, write, only, for, one, company, or, independent, meaning, that, they, can, issue, policies, from, several, companies, the, existence, and, success, of, companies, using, insurance, agents, is, likely, due, to, the, availability, of, improved, and, personalised, services, companies, also,

potentially, be, insured, specific, kinds, of, risk, that, may, give, rise, to, claims, are, known, as, perils, an, insurance, policy, will, set, out, in, detail, which, perils, are, covered, by, the, policy, and, which, are, not, below, are, non, exhaustive, lists, of, the, many, different, types, of, insurance, that, exist, a, single, policy, may, cover, risks, in, one, or, more, of, the, categories, set, out, below, for, example, vehicle, insurance, would, typically, cover, both, the, property, risk, theft, or, damage, to, the, vehicle, and, the, liability, risk, legal, claims, arising, from, an, accident, a, home, insurance, policy, in, the, united, states, typically, includes, coverage, for, damage, to, the, home, and, the, owner, s, belongings, certain, legal, claims, against, the, owner, and, even, a, small, amount, of, coverage, for, medical, expenses, of, guests, who, are, injured, on, the, owner, s, property, business, insurance, can, take, a, number, of, different, forms, such, as, the, various, kinds, of, professional, liability, insurance, also, called, professional, indemnity, pi, which, are, discussed, below, under, that, name, and, the, business, owner, s, policy, bop, which, packages, into, one, policy, many, of, the, kinds, of, coverage, that, a, business, owner, needs, in, a, way, analogous, to, how, homeowners, insurance, packages, the, coverages, that, a, homeowner, needs, vehicle, insurance, protects, the, policyholder, against, financial, loss, in, the, event, of, an, incident, involving, a, vehicle, they, own, such, as, in, a, traffic, collision, coverage, typically, includes, gap, insurance, covers, the, excess, amount, on, an, auto, loan, in, an, instance, where, the, policyholder, s, insurance, company, does, not, cover, the, entire, loan, depending, on, the, company, s, specific, policies, it, might, or, might, not, cover, the, deductible, as, well, this, coverage, is, marketed, for, those, who, put, low, down,

purchases, their, vehicle, but, many, auto, insurance, companies, offer, this, coverage, to, consumers, as, well, health, insurance, policies, cover, the, cost, of, medical, treatments, dental, insurance, like, medical, insurance, protects, policyholders, for, dental, costs, in, most, developed, countries, all, citizens, receive, some, health, coverage, from, their, governments, paid, through, taxation, in, most, countries, health, insurance, is, often, part, of, an, employer, s, benefits, casualty, insurance, insures, against, accidents, not, necessarily, tied, to, any, specific, property, it, is, a, broad, spectrum, of, insurance, that, a, number, of, other, types, of, insurance, could, be, classified, such, as, auto, workers, compensation, and, some, liability, insurances, life, insurance, provides, a, monetary, benefit, to, a, decedent, s, family, or, other, designated, beneficiary, and, may, specifically, provide, for, income, to, an, insured, person, s, family, burial, funeral, and, other, final, expenses, life, insurance, policies, often, allow, the, option, of, having, the, proceeds, paid, to, the, beneficiary, either, in, a, lump, sum, cash, payment, or, an, annuity, in, most, states, a, person, cannot, purchase, a, policy, on, another, person, without, their, knowledge, annuities, provide, a, stream, of, payments, and, are, generally, classified, as, insurance, because, they, are, issued, by, insurance, companies, are, regulated, as, insurance, and, require, the, same, kinds, of, actuarial, and, investment, management, expertise, that, life, insurance, requires, annuities, and, pensions, that, pay, a, benefit, for, life, are, sometimes, regarded, as, insurance, against, the, possibility, that, a, retiree, will, outlive, his, or, her, financial, resources, in, that, sense, they, are, the, complement, of, life, insurance, and, from, an, underwriting, perspective, are, the, mirror, image, of, life, insurance, certain, life, insurance, contracts, accumulate, cash, values, which, may, be, taken, by, the, insured, if, the, policy, is, surrendered, or, which, may, be, borrowed, against, some, policies, such, as, annuities, and, endowment, policies, are, financial, instruments, to, accumulate, or, liquidate, wealth, when, it, is, needed, in, many, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, the, uk, the, tax, law, provides, that, the, interest, on, this, cash, value, is, not, taxable, under, certain, circumstances, this, leads, to, widespread, use, of, life, insurance, as, a, tax, efficient, method, of, saving, as, well, as, protection, in, the, event, of, early, death, in, the, united, states, the, tax, on, interest, income, on, life, insurance, policies, and, annuities, is, generally, deferred, however, in, some, cases, the, benefit, derived, from, tax, deferral, may, be, offset, by, a, low, return, this, depends, upon, the, insuring, company, the, type, of, policy, and, other, variables, mortality, market, return, etc, moreover, other, income, tax, saving, vehicles, e, g, iras, 401, k, plans, roth, iras, may, be, better, alternatives, for, value, accumulation, burial, insurance, is, an, old, type, of, life, insurance, which, is, paid, out, upon, death, to, cover, final, expenses, such, as, the, cost, of, a, funeral, the, greeks, and, romans, introduced, burial, insurance, c, 600, ce, when, they, organized, guilds, called, benevolent, societies, which, cared, for, the, surviving, families, and, paid, funeral, expenses, of, members, upon, death, guilds, in, the, middle, ages, served, a, similar, purpose, as, did, friendly, societies, during, victorian, times, property, insurance, provides, protection, against, risks, to, property, such, as, fire, theft, or, weather, damage, this, may, include, specialized, forms, of, insurance, such, as, fire, insurance, flood, insurance, earthquake, insurance, home, insurance, inland, marine, insurance, or, boiler, insurance, the, term, property, insurance, may, like, casualty, insurance, be, used, as, a, broad, category, of, various, subtypes, of, insurance, some, of, which, are, listed, below, liability, insurance, is, a, broad, superset, that, covers, legal, claims, against, the, insured, many, types, of, insurance, include, an, aspect, of, liability, coverage, for, example, a, homeowner, s, insurance, policy, will, normally, include, liability, coverage, which, protects, the, insured, in, the, event, of, a, claim, brought, by, someone, who, slips, and, falls, on, the, property, automobile, insurance, also, includes, an, aspect, of, liability, insurance, that, indemnifies, against, the, harm, that, a, crashing, car, can, cause, to, others, lives, health, or, property, the, protection, offered, by, a, liability, insurance, policy, is, twofold, a, legal, defense, in, the, event, of, a, lawsuit, commenced, against, the, policyholder, and, indemnification, payment, on, behalf, of, the, insured, with, respect, to, a, settlement, or, court, verdict, liability, policies, typically, cover, only, the, negligence, of, the, insured, and, will, not, apply, to, results, of, wilful, or, intentional, acts, by, the, insured, often, a, commercial, insured, s, liability, insurance, program, consists, of, several, layers, the, first, layer, of, insurance, generally, consists, of, primary, insurance, which, provides, first, dollar, indemnity, for, judgments, and, settlements, up, to, the, limits, of, liability, of, the, primary, policy, generally, primary, insurance, is, subject, to, a, deductible, and, obligates, the, insurer, to, defend, the, insured, against, lawsuits, which, is, normally, accomplished, by, assigning, counsel, to, defend, the, insured, in, many, instances, a, commercial, insured, may, elect, to, self, insure, above, the, primary, insurance, or, self, insured, retention, the, insured, may, have, one, or, more, layers, of, excess, insurance, to, provide, coverage, additional, limits, of, indemnity, protection, there, are, a, variety, of, types, of, excess, insurance, including, stand, alone, excess, policies, policies, that, contain, their, own, terms, conditions, and, exclusions, follow, form, excess, insurance, policies, that, follow, the, terms, of, the, underlying, policy, except, as, specifically, provided, and, umbrella, insurance, policies, excess, insurance, that, in, some, circumstances, could, provide, coverage, that, is, broader, than, the, underlying, insurance, credit, insurance, repays, some, or, all, of, a, loan, when, the, borrower, is, insolvent, cyber, insurance, is, a, business, lines, insurance, product, intended, to, provide, coverage, to, corporations, from, internet, based, risks, and, more, generally, from, risks, relating, to, information, technology, infrastructure, information, privacy, information, governance, liability, and, activities, related, thereto, some, communities, prefer, to, create, virtual, insurance, among, themselves, by, other, means, than, contractual, risk, transfer, which, assigns, explicit, numerical, values, to, risk, a, number, of, religious, groups, including, the, amish, and, some, muslim, groups, depend, on, support, provided, by, their, communities, when, disasters, strike, the, risk, presented, by, any, given, person, is, assumed, collectively, by, the, community, who, all, bear, the, cost, of, rebuilding, lost, property, and, supporting, people, whose, needs, are, suddenly, greater, after, a, loss, of, some, kind, in, supportive, communities, where, others, can, be, trusted, to, follow, community, leaders, this, tacit, form, of, insurance, can, work, in, this, manner, the, community, can, even, out, the, extreme, differences, in, insurability, that, exist, among, its, members, some, further, justification, is, also, provided, by, invoking, the, moral, hazard, of, explicit, insurance, contracts, in, the, united, kingdom, the, crown, which, for, practical, purposes, meant, the, civil, service, did, not, insure, property, such, as, government, buildings, if, a, government, building, was, damaged, the, cost, of, repair, would, be, met, from, public, funds, because, in, the, long, run, this, was, cheaper, than, paying, insurance, premiums, since, many, uk, government, buildings, have, been, sold, to, property, companies, and, rented, back, this, arrangement, is, now, less, common, in, the, united, states, the, most, prevalent, form, of, self, insurance, is, governmental, risk, management, pools, they, are, self, funded, cooperatives, operating, as, carriers, of, coverage, for, the, majority, of, governmental, entities, today, such, as, county, governments, municipalities, and, school, districts, rather, than, these, entities, independently, self, insure, and, risk, bankruptcy, from, a, large, judgment, or, catastrophic, loss, such, governmental, entities, form, a, risk, pool, such, pools, begin, their, operations, by, capitalization, through, member, deposits, or, bond, issuance, coverage, such, as, general, liability, auto, liability, professional, liability, workers, compensation, and, property, is, offered, by, the, pool, to, its, members, similar, to, coverage, offered, by, insurance, companies, however, self, insured, pools, offer, members, lower, rates, due, to, not, needing, insurance, brokers, increased, benefits, such, as, loss, prevention, services, and, subject, matter, expertise, of, approximately, 91, 000, distinct, governmental, entities, operating, in, the, united, states, 75, 000, are, members, of, self, insured, pools, in, various, lines, of, coverage, forming, approximately, 500, pools, although, a, relatively, small, corner, of, the, insurance, market, the, annual, contributions, self, insured, premiums, to, such, pools, have, been, estimated, up, to, 17, billion, dollars, annually, insurance, companies, may, provide, any, combination, of, insurance, types, but, are, often, classified, into, three, groups, general, insurance, companies, can, be, further, divided, into, these, sub, categories, in, most, countries, life, and, non, life, insurers, are, subject, to, different, regulatory, regimes, and, different, tax, and, accounting, rules, the, main, reason, for, the, distinction, between, the, two, types, of, company, is, that, life, annuity, and, pension, business, is, long, term, in, nature, coverage, for, life, assurance, or, a, pension, can, cover, risks, over, many, decades, by, contrast, non, life, insurance, cover, usually, covers, a, shorter, period, such, as, one, year, insurance, companies, are, commonly, classified, as, either, mutual, or, proprietary, companies, mutual, companies, are, owned, by, the, policyholders, while, shareholders, who, may, or, may, not, own, policies, own, proprietary, insurance, companies, demutualization, of, mutual, insurers, to, form, stock, companies, as, well, as, the, formation, of, a, hybrid, known, as, a, mutual, holding, company, became, common, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, in, the, late, 20th, century, however, not, all, states, permit, mutual, holding, companies, reinsurance, companies, are, insurance, companies, that, provide, policies, to, other, insurance, companies, allowing, them, to, reduce, their, risks, and, protect, themselves, from, substantial, losses, the, reinsurance, market, is, dominated, by, a, few, large, companies, with, huge, reserves, a, reinsurer, may, also, be, a, direct, writer, of, insurance, risks, as, well, captive, insurance, companies, can, be, defined, as, limited, purpose, insurance, companies, established, with, the, specific, objective, of, financing, risks, emanating, from, their, parent, group, or, groups, this, definition, can, sometimes, be, extended, to, include, some, of, the, risks, of, the, parent, company, s, customers, in, short, it, is, an, in, house, self, insurance, vehicle, captives, may, take, the, form, of, a, pure, entity, which, is, a, 100, subsidiary, of, the, self, insured, parent, company, of, a, mutual, captive, which, insures, the, collective, risks, of, members, of, an, industry, and, of, an, association, captive, which, self, insures, individual, risks, of, the, members, of, a, professional, commercial, or, industrial, association, captives, represent, commercial, economic, and, tax, advantages, to, their, sponsors, because, of, the, reductions, in, costs, they, help, create, and, for, the, ease, of, insurance, risk, management, and, the, flexibility, for, cash, flows, they, generate, additionally, they, may, provide, coverage, of, risks, which, is, neither, available, nor, offered, in, the, traditional, insurance, market, at, reasonable, prices, the, types, of, risk, that, a, captive, can, underwrite, for, their, parents, include, property, damage, public, and, product, liability, professional, indemnity, employee, benefits, employers, liability, motor, and, medical, aid, expenses, the, captive, s, exposure, to, such, risks, may, be, limited, by, the, use, of, reinsurance, captives, are, becoming, an, increasingly, important, component, of, the, risk, management, and, risk, financing, strategy, of, their, parent, this, can, be, understood, against, the, following, background, other, possible, forms, for, an, insurance, company, include, reciprocals, in, which, policyholders, reciprocate, in, sharing, risks, and, lloyd, s, organizations, admitted, insurance, companies, are, those, in, the, united, states, that, have, been, admitted, or, licensed, by, the, state, licensing, agency, the, insurance, they, provide, is, called, admitted, insurance, non, admitted, companies, have, not, been, approved, by, the, state, licensing, agency, but, are, allowed, to, provide, insurance, under, special, circumstances, when, they, meet, an, insurance, need, that, admitted, companies, cannot, or, will, not, meet, there, are, also, companies, known, as, insurance, consultants, like, a, mortgage, broker, these, companies, are, paid, a, fee, by, the, customer, to, shop, around, for, the, best, insurance, policy, among, many, companies, similar, to, an, insurance, consultant, an, insurance, broker, also, shops, around, for, the, best, insurance, policy, among, many, companies, however, with, insurance, brokers, the, fee, is, usually, paid, in, the, form, of, commission, from, the, insurer, that, is, selected, rather, than, directly, from, the, client, neither, insurance, consultants, nor, insurance, brokers, are, insurance, companies, and, no, risks, are, transferred, to, them, in, insurance, transactions, third, party, administrators, are, companies, that, perform, underwriting, and, sometimes, claims, handling, services, for, insurance, companies, these, companies, often, have, special, expertise, that, the, insurance, companies, do, not, have, the, financial, stability, and, strength, of, an, insurance, company, is, a, consideration, when, buying, an, insurance, contract, an, insurance, premium, paid, currently, provides, coverage, for, losses, that, might, arise, many, years, in, the, future, for, that, reason, a, more, financially, stable, insurance, carrier, reduces, the, risk, of, the, insurance, company, becoming, insolvent, leaving, their, policyholders, with, no, coverage, or, coverage, only, from, a, government, backed, insurance, pool, or, other, arrangements, with, less, attractive, payouts, for, losses, a, number, of, independent, rating, agencies, provide, information, and, rate, the, financial, viability, of, insurance, companies, insurance, companies, are, rated, by, various, agencies, such, as, am, best, the, ratings, include, the, company, s, financial, strength, which, measures, its, ability, to, pay, claims, it, also, rates, financial, instruments, issued, by, the, insurance, company, such, as, bonds, notes, and, securitization, products, advanced, economies, account, for, the, bulk, of, the, global, insurance, industry, according, to, swiss, re, the, global, insurance, market, wrote, 6, 782, trillion, in, direct, premiums, in, 2022, direct, premiums, means, premiums, written, directly, by, insurers, before, accounting, for, ceding, of, risk, to, reinsurers, as, usual, the, united, states, was, the, country, with, the, largest, insurance, market, with, 2, 959, trillion, 43, 6, of, direct, premiums, written, with, the, people, s, republic, of, china, coming, in, second, at, only, 697, billion, 10, 3, japan, coming, in, third, at, 337, billion, 5, 0, and, the, united, kingdom, coming, in, fourth, at, 363, billion, 5, 4, however, the, european, union, s, single, market, is, the, actual, second, largest, market, with, 17, percent, market, share, in, the, united, states, insurance, is, regulated, by, the, states, under, the, mccarran, ferguson, act, with, periodic, proposals, for, federal, intervention, and, a, nonprofit, coalition, of, state, insurance, agencies, called, the, national, association, of, insurance, commissioners, works, to, harmonize, the, country, s, different, laws, and, regulations, the, national, conference, of, insurance, legislators, ncoil, also, works, to, harmonize, the, different, state, laws, in, the, european, union, the, third, non, life, directive, and, the, third, life, directive, both, passed, in, 1992, and, effective, 1994, created, a, single, insurance, market, in, europe, and, allowed, insurance, companies, to, offer, insurance, anywhere, in, the, eu, subject, to, permission, from, authority, in, the, head, office, and, allowed, insurance, consumers, to, purchase, insurance, from, any, insurer, in, the, eu, as, far, as, insurance, in, the, united, kingdom, the, financial, services, authority, took, over, insurance, regulation, from, the, general, insurance, standards, council, in, 2005, laws, passed, include, the, insurance, companies, act, 1973, and, another, in, 1982, and, reforms, to, warranty, and, other, aspects, under, discussion, as, of, 2012, the, insurance, industry, in, china, was, nationalized, in, 1949, and, thereafter, offered, by, only, a, single, state, owned, company, the, people, s, insurance, company, of, china, which, was, eventually, suspended, as, demand, declined, in, a, communist, environment, in, 1978, market, reforms, led, to, an, increase, in, the, market, and, by, 1995, a, comprehensive, insurance, law, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, was, passed, followed, in, 1998, by, the, formation, of, china, insurance, regulatory, commission, circ, which, has, broad, regulatory, authority, over, the, insurance, market, of, china, in, india, irda, is, insurance, regulatory, authority, as, per, the, section, 4, of, irda, act, 1999, insurance, regulatory, and, development, authority, irda, which, was, constituted, by, an, act, of, parliament, national, insurance, academy, pune, is, apex, insurance, capacity, builder, institute, promoted, with, support, from, ministry, of, finance, and, by, lic, life, general, insurance, companies, in, 2017, within, the, framework, of, the, joint, project, of, the, bank, of, russia, and, yandex, a, special, check, mark, a, green, circle, with, a, tick, and, unified, state, register, of, insurance, entities, text, box, appeared, in, the, search, for, yandex, system, informing, the, consumer, that, the, company, s, financial, services, are, offered, on, the, marked, website, which, has, the, status, of, an, insurance, company, a, broker, or, a, mutual, insurance, association, insurance, is, just, a, risk, transfer, mechanism, wherein, the, financial, burden, which, may, arise, due, to, some, fortuitous, event, is, transferred, to, a, bigger, entity, i, e, an, insurance, company, by, way, of, paying, premiums, this, only, reduces, the, financial, burden, and, not, the, actual, chances, of, happening, of, an, event, insurance, is, a, risk, for, both, the, insurance, company, and, the, insured, the, insurance, company, understands, the, risk, involved, and, will, perform, a, risk, assessment, when, writing, the, policy, as, a, result, the, premiums, may, go, up, if, they, determine, that, the, policyholder, will, file, a, claim, however, premiums, might, reduce, if, the, policyholder, commits, to, a, risk, management, program, as, recommended, by, the, insurer, it, is, therefore, important, that, insurers, view, risk, management, as, a, joint, initiative, between, policyholder, and, insurer, since, a, robust, risk, management, plan, minimizes, the, possibility, of, a, large, claim, for, the, insurer, while, stabilizing, or, reducing, premiums, for, the, policyholder, if, a, person, is, financially, stable, and, plans, for, life, s, unexpected, events, they, may, be, able, to, go, without, insurance, however, they, must, have, enough, to, cover, a, total, and, complete, loss, of, employment, and, of, their, possessions, some, states, will, accept, a, surety, bond, a, government, bond, or, even, making, a, cash, deposit, with, the, state, an, insurance, company, may, inadvertently, find, that, its, insureds, may, not, be, as, risk, averse, as, they, might, otherwise, be, since, by, definition, the, insured, has, transferred, the, risk, to, the, insurer, a, concept, known, as, moral, hazard, this, insulates, many, from, the, true, costs, of, living, with, risk, negating, measures, that, can, mitigate, or, adapt, to, risk, and, leading, some, to, describe, insurance, schemes, as, potentially, maladaptive, insurance, policies, can, be, complex, and, some, policyholders, may, not, understand, all, the, fees, and, coverages, included, in, a, policy, as, a, result, people, may, buy, policies, on, unfavorable, terms, in, response, to, these, issues, many, countries, have, enacted, detailed, statutory, and, regulatory, regimes, governing, every, aspect, of, the, insurance, business, including, minimum, standards, for, policies, and, the, ways, in, which, they, may, be, advertised, and, sold, for, example, most, insurance, policies, in, the, english, language, today, have, been, carefully, drafted, in, plain, english, the, industry, learned, the, hard, way, that, many, courts, will, not, enforce, policies, against, insureds, when, the, judges, themselves, cannot, understand, what, the, policies, are, saying, typically, courts, construe, ambiguities, in, insurance, policies, against, the, insurance, company, and, in, favor, of, coverage, under, the, policy, many, institutional, insurance, purchasers, buy, insurance, through, an, insurance, broker, while, on, the, surface, it, appears, the, broker, represents, the, buyer, not, the, insurance, company, and, typically, counsels, the, buyer, on, appropriate, coverage, and, policy, limitations, in, the, vast, majority, of, cases, a, broker, s, compensation, comes, in, the, form, of, a, commission, as, a, percentage, of, the, insurance, premium, creating, a, conflict, of, interest, in, that, the, broker, s, financial, interest, is, tilted, toward, encouraging, an, insured, to, purchase, more, insurance, than, might, be, necessary, at, a, higher, price, a, broker, generally, holds, contracts, with, many, insurers, thereby, allowing, the, broker, to, shop, the, market, for, the, best, rates, and, coverage, possible, insurance, may, also, be, purchased, through, an, agent, a, tied, agent, working, exclusively, with, one, insurer, represents, the, insurance, company, from, whom, the, policyholder, buys, while, a, free, agent, sells, policies, of, various, insurance, companies, just, as, there, is, a, potential, conflict, of, interest, with, a, broker, an, agent, has, a, different, type, of, conflict, because, agents, work, directly, for, the, insurance, company, if, there, is, a, claim, the, agent, may, advise, the, client, to, the, benefit, of, the, insurance, company, agents, generally, cannot, offer, as, broad, a, range, of, selection, compared, to, an, insurance, broker, an, independent, insurance, consultant, advises, insureds, on, a, fee, for, service, retainer, similar, to, an, attorney, and, thus, offers, completely, independent, advice, free, of, the, financial, conflict, of, interest, of, brokers, or, agents, however, such, a, consultant, must, still, work, through, brokers, or, agents, in, order, to, secure, coverage, for, their, clients, in, the, united, states, economists, and, consumer, advocates, generally, consider, insurance, to, be, worthwhile, for, low, probability, catastrophic, losses, but, not, for, high, probability, small, losses, because, of, this, consumers, are, advised, to, select, high, deductibles, and, to, not, insure, losses, which, would, not, cause, a, disruption, in, their, life, however, consumers, have, shown, a, tendency, to, prefer, low, deductibles, and, to, prefer, to, insure, relatively, high, probability, small, losses, over, low, probability, perhaps, due, to, not, understanding, or, ignoring, the, low, probability, risk, this, is, associated, with, reduced, purchasing, of, insurance, against, low, probability, losses, and, may, result, in, increased, inefficiencies, from, moral, hazard, redlining, is, the, practice, of, denying, insurance, coverage, in, specific, geographic, areas, supposedly, because, of, a, high, likelihood, of, loss, while, the, alleged, motivation, is, unlawful, discrimination, racial, profiling, or, redlining, has, a, long, history, in, the, property, insurance, industry, in, the, united, states, from, a, review, of, industry, underwriting, and, marketing, materials, court, documents, and, research, by, government, agencies, industry, and, community, groups, and, academics, it, is, clear, that, race, has, long, affected, and, continues, to, affect, the, policies, and, practices, of, the, insurance, industry, in, july, 2007, the, us, federal, trade, commission, ftc, released, a, report, presenting, the, results, of, a, study, concerning, credit, based, insurance, scores, in, automobile, insurance, the, study, found, that, these, scores, are, effective, predictors, of, risk, it, also, showed, that, african, americans, and, hispanics, are, substantially, overrepresented, in, the, lowest, credit, scores, and, substantially, underrepresented, in, the, highest, while, caucasians, and, asians, are, more, evenly, spread, across, the, scores, the, credit, scores, were, also, found, to, predict, risk, within, each, of, the, ethnic, groups, leading, the, ftc, to, conclude, that, the, scoring, models, are, not, solely, proxies, for, redlining, the, ftc, indicated, little, data, was, available, to, evaluate, benefit, of, insurance, scores, to, consumers, the, report, was, disputed, by, representatives, of, the, consumer, federation, of, america, the, national, fair, housing, alliance, the, national, consumer, law, center, and, the, center, for, economic, justice, for, relying, on, data, provided, by, the, insurance, industry, all, states, have, provisions, in, their, rate, regulation, laws, or, in, their, fair, trade, practice, acts, that, prohibit, unfair, discrimination, often, called, redlining, in, setting, rates, and, making, insurance, available, in, determining, premiums, and, premium, rate, structures, insurers, consider, quantifiable, factors, including, location, credit, scores, gender, occupation, marital, status, and, education, level, however, the, use, of, such, factors, is, often, considered, to, be, unfair, or, unlawfully, discriminatory, and, the, reaction, against, this, practice, has, in, some, instances, led, to, political, disputes, about, the, ways, in, which, insurers, determine, premiums, and, regulatory, intervention, to, limit, the, factors, used, an, insurance, underwriter, s, job, is, to, evaluate, a, given, risk, as, to, the, likelihood, that, a, loss, will, occur, any, factor, that, causes, a, greater, likelihood, of,
