in, grammar, a, conjunction, abbreviated, conj, or, cnj, is, a, part, of, speech, that, connects, words, phrases, or, clauses, which, are, called, its, conjuncts, that, description, is, vague, enough, to, overlap, with, those, of, other, parts, of, speech, because, what, constitutes, a, conjunction, must, be, defined, for, each, language, in, english, a, given, word, may, have, several, senses, and, in, some, contexts, be, a, preposition, but, a, conjunction, in, others, depending, on, the, syntax, for, example, after, is, a, preposition, in, he, left, after, the, fight, but, a, conjunction, in, he, left, after, they, fought, in, general, a, conjunction, is, an, invariant, non, inflecting, grammatical, particle, that, stands, between, conjuncts, a, conjunction, may, be, placed, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, but, some, superstition, about, the, practice, persists, the, definition, may, be, extended, to, idiomatic, phrases, that, behave, as, a, unit, and, perform, the, same, function, e, g, as, well, as, provided, that, a, simple, literary, example, of, a, conjunction, is, the, truth, of, nature, and, the, power, of, giving, interest, samuel, taylor, coleridge, s, biographia, literaria, commas, are, often, used, to, separate, clauses, in, english, a, comma, is, used, to, separate, a, dependent, clause, from, the, independent, clause, if, the, dependent, clause, comes, first, after, i, fed, the, cat, i, brushed, my, clothes, compare, this, with, i, brushed, my, clothes, after, i, fed, the, cat, a, relative, clause, takes, commas, if, it, is, non, restrictive, as, in, i, cut, down, all, the, trees, which, were, over, six, feet, tall, without, the, comma, this, would, mean, that, only, the, trees, more, than, six, feet, tall, were, cut, down, some, style, guides, prescribe, that, two, independent, clauses, joined, by, a, coordinating, conjunction, for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so, must, be, separated, by, a, comma, placed, before, the, conjunction, in, the, following, sentences, where, the, second, clause, is, independent, because, it, can, stand, alone, as, a, sentence, the, comma, is, considered, by, those, guides, to, be, necessary, in, the, following, sentences, where, the, second, half, of, the, sentence, is, not, an, independent, clause, because, it, does, not, contain, an, explicit, subject, those, guides, prescribe, that, the, comma, be, omitted, however, such, guides, permit, the, comma, to, be, omitted, if, the, second, independent, clause, is, very, short, typically, when, the, second, independent, clause, is, an, imperative, as, in, the, above, guidance, is, not, universally, accepted, or, applied, long, coordinate, clauses, are, nonetheless, usually, separated, by, commas, a, comma, between, clauses, may, change, the, connotation, reducing, or, eliminating, ambiguity, in, the, following, examples, the, thing, in, the, first, sentence, that, is, very, relaxing, is, the, cool, day, whereas, in, the, second, sentence, it, is, the, walk, since, the, introduction, of, commas, makes, on, a, cool, day, parenthetical, if, another, prepositional, phrase, is, introduced, ambiguity, increases, but, when, commas, separate, each, clause, and, phrase, the, restrictive, clause, can, remain, a, modifier, of, the, walk, in, some, languages, such, as, german, and, polish, stricter, rules, apply, on, comma, use, between, clauses, with, dependent, clauses, always, being, set, off, with, commas, and, commas, being, generally, proscribed, before, certain, coordinating, conjunctions, the, joining, of, two, independent, sentences, with, a, comma, and, no, conjunction, as, in, it, is, nearly, half, past, five, we, cannot, reach, town, before, dark, is, known, as, a, comma, splice, and, is, sometimes, considered, an, error, in, english, in, most, cases, a, semicolon, should, be, used, instead, a, comma, splice, should, not, be, confused, though, with, the, literary, device, called, asyndeton, in, which, coordinating, conjunctions, are, purposely, omitted, for, a, specific, stylistic, effect, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, an, element, of, a, conjunction, was, known, as, a, conjunct, a, conjunction, itself, was, then, called, a, connective, that, archaic, term, however, diminished, in, usage, during, the, early, 20th, century, in, its, place, the, terms, coordinating, conjunction, coined, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, correlative, conjunction, coined, in, the, early, 19th, century, became, more, commonly, used, coordinating, conjunctions, also, called, coordinators, are, conjunctions, that, join, or, coordinate, two, or, more, items, such, as, words, main, clauses, or, sentences, of, equal, syntactic, importance, in, english, the, mnemonic, acronym, fanboys, can, be, used, to, remember, the, most, commonly, used, coordinators, for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and, so, these, are, not, the, only, coordinating, conjunctions, various, others, are, used, including, and, nor, british, but, nor, british, neither, they, don, t, gamble, neither, do, they, smoke, no, more, they, don, t, gamble, no, more, do, they, smoke, and, only, i, would, go, only, i, don, t, have, time, ch, 9, p, 171, types, of, coordinating, conjunctions, include, cumulative, conjunctions, adversative, conjunctions, alternative, conjunctions, and, illative, conjunctions, here, are, some, examples, of, coordinating, conjunctions, in, english, and, what, they, do, only, and, or, nor, are, actual, coordinating, logical, operators, connecting, atomic, propositions, or, syntactic, multiple, units, of, the, same, type, subject, objects, predicative, attributive, expressions, etc, within, a, sentence, the, cause, and, consequence, illative, conjunctions, are, pseudo, coordinators, being, expressible, as, antecedent, or, consequent, to, logical, implications, or, grammatically, as, subordinate, conditional, clauses, correlative, conjunctions, are, pairs, of, conjunctions, that, join, two, or, more, correlated, lexical, items, within, a, sentence, there, are, many, different, pairs, of, correlative, conjunctions, examples, examples, subordinating, conjunctions, also, called, subordinators, are, conjunctions, that, introduce, content, relative, and, adverbial, clauses, as, subordinate, ones, and, join, them, to, other, clauses, whether, independent, or, dependent, the, most, common, subordinating, conjunctions, in, english, include, after, although, as, as, far, as, as, if, as, long, as, as, soon, as, as, though, because, before, even, if, even, though, every, time, if, in, order, that, since, so, so, that, than, that, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, and, while, a, complementizer, is, subordinating, conjunction, that, introduces, a, content, clause, that, is, a, clause, that, is, a, complement, of, the, verb, phrase, instead, of, the, more, typical, nominal, subject, or, object, e, g, i, wonder, whether, he, ll, be, late, i, hope, that, he, ll, be, on, time, some, subordinating, conjunctions, when, used, to, introduce, a, phrase, instead, of, a, full, clause, become, prepositions, with, identical, meanings, relativizers, are, subordinators, that, introduce, relative, clauses, the, subordinating, conjunction, performs, two, important, functions, within, a, sentence, marking, the, higher, rank, of, the, independent, clause, and, transiting, between, the, two, clauses, ideas, by, indicating, the, nexus, of, time, place, or, cause, subordinators, therefore, structure, the, relationship, between, the, clauses, in, many, verb, final, languages, subordinate, clauses, must, precede, the, main, clause, on, which, they, depend, the, equivalents, to, the, subordinating, conjunctions, of, non, verb, final, languages, such, as, english, are, either, such, languages, often, lack, conjunctions, as, a, part, of, speech, because, in, other, west, germanic, languages, like, german, and, dutch, the, word, order, after, a, subordinating, conjunction, is, different, from, that, in, an, independent, clause, e, g, in, dutch, want, for, is, coordinating, but, omdat, because, is, subordinating, the, clause, after, the, coordinating, conjunction, has, normal, word, order, but, the, clause, after, the, subordinating, conjunction, has, verb, final, word, order, compare, similarly, in, german, denn, for, is, coordinating, but, weil, because, is, subordinating, it, is, now, generally, agreed, that, a, sentence, may, begin, with, a, coordinating, conjunction, like, and, but, or, yet, while, some, people, consider, this, usage, improper, follett, s, modern, american, usage, labels, its, prohibition, a, supposed, rule, without, foundation, and, a, prejudice, lingers, from, a, bygone, time, some, associate, this, belief, with, their, early, school, days, one, conjecture, is, that, it, results, from, young, children, s, being, taught, to, avoid, simple, sentences, starting, with, and, and, are, encouraged, to, use, more, complex, structures, with, subordinating, conjunctions, in, the, words, of, bryan, a, garner, the, widespread, belief, that, it, is, an, error, to, begin, a, sentence, with, a, conjunction, such, as, and, but, or, so, has, no, historical, or, grammatical, foundation, and, good, writers, have, frequently, started, sentences, with, conjunctions, there, is, also, a, misleading, guideline, that, a, sentence, should, never, begin, with, because, because, is, a, subordinating, conjunction, and, introduces, a, dependent, clause, it, may, start, a, sentence, when, the, main, clause, follows, the, dependent, clause
