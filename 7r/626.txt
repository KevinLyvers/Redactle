the, world, international, treaties, agreements, alliances, and, other, manifestations, of, international, relations, are, usually, the, result, of, diplomatic, negotiations, and, processes, diplomats, may, also, help, shape, a, state, by, advising, government, officials, modern, diplomatic, methods, practices, and, principles, originated, largely, from, 17th, century, european, customs, beginning, in, the, early, 20th, century, diplomacy, became, professionalized, the, 1961, vienna, convention, on, diplomatic, relations, ratified, by, most, of, the, world, s, sovereign, states, provides, a, framework, for, diplomatic, procedures, methods, and, conduct, most, diplomacy, is, now, conducted, by, accredited, officials, such, as, envoys, and, ambassadors, through, a, dedicated, foreign, affairs, office, diplomats, operate, through, diplomatic, missions, most, commonly, consulates, and, embassies, and, rely, on, a, number, of, support, staff, the, term, diplomat, is, thus, sometimes, applied, broadly, to, diplomatic, and, consular, personnel, and, foreign, ministry, officials, the, term, diplomacy, is, derived, from, the, 18th, century, french, term, diplomate, diplomat, or, diplomatist, based, on, the, ancient, greek, dipl, ma, which, roughly, means, an, object, folded, in, two, this, reflected, the, practice, of, sovereigns, providing, a, folded, document, to, confer, some, official, privilege, prior, to, the, invention, of, the, envelope, folding, a, document, served, to, protect, the, privacy, of, its, content, the, term, was, later, applied, to, all, official, documents, such, as, those, containing, agreements, between, governments, and, thus, became, identified, with, international, relations, this, established, history, has, in, recent, years, been, criticized, by, scholars, pointing, out, how, the, term, originates, in, the, political, context, of, the, french, revolution, some, of, the, earliest, known, diplomatic, records, are, the, amarna, letters, written, between, the, pharaohs, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, of, egypt, and, the, amurru, rulers, of, canaan, during, the, 14th, century, bc, peace, treaties, were, concluded, between, the, mesopotamian, city, states, of, lagash, and, umma, around, approximately, 2100, bc, following, the, battle, of, kadesh, in, 1274, bc, during, the, nineteenth, dynasty, the, pharaoh, of, egypt, and, the, ruler, of, the, hittite, empire, created, one, of, the, first, known, international, peace, treaties, which, survives, in, stone, tablet, fragments, now, generally, called, the, egyptian, hittite, peace, treaty, the, ancient, greek, city, states, on, some, occasions, dispatched, envoys, to, negotiate, specific, issues, such, as, war, and, peace, or, commercial, relations, but, did, not, have, diplomatic, representatives, regularly, posted, in, each, other, s, territory, however, some, of, the, functions, given, to, modern, diplomatic, representatives, were, fulfilled, by, a, proxenos, a, citizen, of, the, host, city, who, had, friendly, relations, with, another, city, often, through, familial, ties, in, times, of, peace, diplomacy, was, even, conducted, with, non, hellenistic, rivals, such, as, the, achaemenid, empire, of, persia, through, it, was, ultimately, conquered, by, alexander, the, great, of, macedon, alexander, was, also, adept, at, diplomacy, realizing, that, the, conquest, of, foreign, cultures, would, be, better, achieved, by, having, his, macedonian, and, greek, subjects, intermingle, and, intermarry, with, native, populations, for, instance, alexander, took, as, his, wife, a, sogdian, woman, of, bactria, roxana, after, the, siege, of, the, sogdian, rock, in, order, to, placate, the, rebelling, populace, diplomacy, remained, a, necessary, tool, of, statecraft, for, the, great, hellenistic, states, that, succeeded, alexander, s, empire, such, as, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, and, seleucid, empire, which, fought, several, wars, in, the, near, east, and, often, negotiated, peace, treaties, through, marriage, alliances, relations, with, the, ottoman, empire, were, particularly, important, to, italian, states, to, which, the, ottoman, government, was, known, as, the, sublime, porte, the, maritime, republics, of, genoa, and, venice, depended, less, and, less, upon, their, nautical, capabilities, and, more, and, more, upon, the, perpetuation, of, good, relations, with, the, ottomans, interactions, between, various, merchants, diplomats, and, clergymen, hailing, from, the, italian, and, ottoman, empires, helped, inaugurate, and, create, new, forms, of, diplomacy, and, statecraft, eventually, the, primary, purpose, of, a, diplomat, which, was, originally, a, negotiator, evolved, into, a, persona, that, represented, an, autonomous, state, in, all, aspects, of, political, affairs, it, became, evident, that, all, other, sovereigns, felt, the, need, to, accommodate, themselves, diplomatically, due, to, the, emergence, of, the, powerful, political, environment, of, the, ottoman, empire, one, could, come, to, the, conclusion, that, the, atmosphere, of, diplomacy, within, the, early, modern, period, revolved, around, a, foundation, of, conformity, to, ottoman, culture, one, of, the, earliest, realists, in, international, relations, theory, was, the, 6th, century, bc, military, strategist, sun, tzu, d, 496, bc, author, of, the, art, of, war, he, lived, during, a, time, in, which, rival, states, were, starting, to, pay, less, attention, to, traditional, respects, of, tutelage, to, the, zhou, dynasty, c, 1050, 256, bc, figurehead, monarchs, while, each, vied, for, power, and, total, conquest, however, a, great, deal, of, diplomacy, in, establishing, allies, bartering, land, and, signing, peace, treaties, was, necessary, for, each, warring, state, and, the, idealized, role, of, the, persuader, diplomat, developed, from, the, battle, of, baideng, 200, bc, to, the, battle, of, mayi, 133, bc, the, han, dynasty, was, forced, to, uphold, a, marriage, alliance, and, pay, an, exorbitant, amount, of, tribute, in, silk, cloth, grain, and, other, foodstuffs, to, the, powerful, northern, nomadic, xiongnu, that, had, been, consolidated, by, modu, shanyu, after, the, xiongnu, sent, word, to, emperor, wen, of, han, r, 180, 157, that, they, controlled, areas, stretching, from, manchuria, to, the, tarim, basin, oasis, city, states, a, treaty, was, drafted, in, 162, bc, proclaiming, that, everything, north, of, the, great, wall, belong, to, nomads, lands, while, everything, south, of, it, would, be, reserved, for, han, chinese, the, treaty, was, renewed, no, less, than, nine, times, but, did, not, restrain, some, xiongnu, tuqi, from, raiding, han, borders, that, was, until, the, far, flung, campaigns, of, emperor, wu, of, han, r, 141, 87, bc, which, shattered, the, unity, of, the, xiongnu, and, allowed, han, to, conquer, the, western, regions, under, wu, in, 104, bc, the, han, armies, ventured, as, far, fergana, in, central, asia, to, battle, the, yuezhi, who, had, conquered, hellenistic, greek, areas, the, koreans, and, japanese, during, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ad, looked, to, the, chinese, capital, of, chang, an, as, the, hub, of, civilization, and, emulated, its, central, bureaucracy, as, the, model, of, governance, the, japanese, sent, frequent, embassies, to, china, in, this, period, although, they, halted, these, trips, in, 894, when, the, tang, seemed, on, the, brink, of, collapse, after, the, devastating, an, shi, rebellion, from, 755, to, 763, the, tang, dynasty, was, in, no, position, to, reconquer, central, asia, and, the, tarim, basin, after, several, conflicts, with, the, tibetan, empire, spanning, several, different, decades, the, tang, finally, made, a, truce, and, signed, a, peace, treaty, with, them, in, 841, in, the, 11th, century, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, there, were, shrewd, ambassadors, such, as, shen, kuo, and, su, song, who, achieved, diplomatic, success, with, the, liao, dynasty, the, often, hostile, khitan, neighbor, to, the, north, both, diplomats, secured, the, rightful, borders, of, the, song, dynasty, through, knowledge, of, cartography, and, dredging, up, old, court, archives, there, was, also, a, triad, of, warfare, and, diplomacy, between, these, two, states, and, the, tangut, western, xia, dynasty, to, the, northwest, of, song, china, centered, in, modern, day, shaanxi, after, warring, with, the, l, dynasty, of, vietnam, from, 1075, to, 1077, song, and, l, made, a, peace, agreement, in, 1082, to, exchange, the, respective, lands, they, had, captured, from, each, other, during, the, war, long, before, the, tang, and, song, dynasties, the, chinese, had, sent, envoys, into, central, asia, india, and, persia, starting, with, zhang, qian, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, another, notable, event, in, chinese, diplomacy, was, the, chinese, embassy, mission, of, zhou, daguan, to, the, khmer, empire, of, cambodia, in, the, 13th, century, chinese, diplomacy, was, a, necessity, in, the, distinctive, period, of, chinese, exploration, since, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ad, the, chinese, also, became, heavily, invested, in, sending, diplomatic, envoys, abroad, on, maritime, missions, into, the, indian, ocean, to, india, persia, arabia, east, africa, and, egypt, chinese, maritime, activity, was, increased, dramatically, during, the, commercialized, period, of, the, song, dynasty, with, new, nautical, technologies, many, more, private, ship, owners, and, an, increasing, amount, of, economic, investors, in, overseas, ventures, during, the, mongol, empire, 1206, 1294, the, mongols, created, something, similar, to, today, s, diplomatic, passport, called, paiza, the, paiza, were, in, three, different, types, golden, silver, and, copper, depending, on, the, envoy, s, level, of, importance, with, the, paiza, there, came, authority, that, the, envoy, can,

systems, for, example, as, part, of, diplomatic, negotiations, with, the, west, over, control, of, land, and, trade, in, china, in, the, 19th, century, after, the, first, opium, war, the, chinese, diplomat, qiying, gifted, intimate, portraits, of, himself, to, representatives, from, italy, england, the, united, states, and, france, ancient, india, with, its, kingdoms, and, dynasties, had, a, long, tradition, of, diplomacy, the, oldest, treatise, on, statecraft, and, diplomacy, arthashastra, is, attributed, to, kautilya, also, known, as, chanakya, who, was, the, principal, adviser, to, chandragupta, maurya, the, founder, of, the, maurya, dynasty, who, ruled, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, it, incorporates, a, theory, of, diplomacy, of, how, in, a, situation, of, mutually, contesting, kingdoms, the, wise, king, builds, alliances, and, tries, to, checkmate, his, adversaries, the, envoys, sent, at, the, time, to, the, courts, of, other, kingdoms, tended, to, reside, for, extended, periods, of, time, and, arthashastra, contains, advice, on, the, deportment, of, the, envoy, including, the, trenchant, suggestion, that, he, should, sleep, alone, the, highest, morality, for, the, king, is, that, his, kingdom, should, prosper, new, analysis, of, arthashastra, brings, out, that, hidden, inside, the, 6, 000, aphorisms, of, prose, sutras, are, pioneering, political, and, philosophic, concepts, it, covers, the, internal, and, external, spheres, of, statecraft, politics, and, administration, the, normative, element, is, the, political, unification, of, the, geopolitical, and, cultural, subcontinent, of, india, this, work, comprehensively, studies, state, governance, it, urges, non, injury, to, living, creatures, or, malice, as, well, as, compassion, forbearance, truthfulness, and, uprightness, it, presents, a, rajmandala, grouping, of, states, a, model, that, places, the, home, state, surrounded, by, twelve, competing, entities, which, can, either, be, potential, adversaries, or, latent, allies, depending, on, how, relations, with, them, are, managed, this, is, the, essence, of, realpolitik, it, also, offers, four, upaya, policy, approaches, conciliation, gifts, rupture, or, dissent, and, force, it, counsels, that, war, is, the, last, resort, as, its, outcome, is, always, uncertain, this, is, the, first, expression, of, the, raison, d, etat, doctrine, as, also, of, humanitarian, law, that, conquered, people, must, be, treated, fairly, and, assimilated, the, key, challenge, to, the, byzantine, empire, was, to, maintain, a, set, of, relations, between, itself, and, its, sundry, neighbors, including, the, georgians, iberians, the, germanic, peoples, the, bulgars, the, slavs, the, armenians, the, huns, the, avars, the, franks, the, lombards, and, the, arabs, that, embodied, and, so, maintained, its, imperial, status, all, these, neighbors, lacked, a, key, resource, that, byzantium, had, taken, over, from, rome, namely, a, formalized, legal, structure, when, they, set, about, forging, formal, political, institutions, they, were, dependent, on, the, empire, whereas, classical, writers, are, fond, of, making, a, sharp, distinction, between, peace, and, war, for, the, byzantines, diplomacy, was, a, form, of, war, by, other, means, with, a, regular, army, of, 120, 000, 140, 000, men, after, the, losses, of, the, 7th, century, the, empire, s, security, depended, on, activist, diplomacy, byzantium, s, bureau, of, barbarians, was, the, first, foreign, intelligence, agency, gathering, information, on, the, empire, s, rivals, from, every, imaginable, source, while, on, the, surface, a, protocol, office, its, main, duty, was, to, ensure, foreign, envoys, were, properly, cared, for, and, received, sufficient, state, funds, for, their, maintenance, and, it, kept, all, the, official, translators, it, clearly, had, a, security, function, as, well, on, strategy, from, the, 6th, century, offers,

kept, under, surveillance, to, keep, them, from, obtaining, any, information, by, asking, questions, of, our, people, in, europe, early, modern, diplomacy, s, origins, are, often, traced, to, the, states, of, northern, italy, in, the, early, renaissance, with, the, first, embassies, being, established, in, the, 13th, century, milan, played, a, leading, role, especially, under, francesco, sforza, who, established, permanent, embassies, to, the, other, city, states, of, northern, italy, tuscany, and, venice, were, also, flourishing, centers, of, diplomacy, from, the, 14th, century, onward, it, was, in, the, italian, peninsula, that, many, of, the, traditions, of, modern, diplomacy, began, such, as, the, presentation, of, an, ambassador, s, credentials, to, the, head, of, state, from, italy, the, practice, was, spread, across, europe, milan, was, the, first, to, send, a, representative, to, the, court, of, france, in, 1455, however, milan, refused, to, host, french, representatives, fearing, they, would, conduct, espionage, and, intervene, in, its, internal, affairs, as, foreign, powers, such, as, france, and, spain, became, increasingly, involved, in, italian, politics, the, need, to, accept, emissaries, was, recognized, soon, the, major, european, powers, were, exchanging, representatives, spain, was, the, first, to, send, a, permanent, representative, it, appointed, an, ambassador, to, the, court, of, st, james, s, i, e, england, in, 1487, by, the, late, 16th, century, permanent, missions, became, customary, the, holy, roman, emperor, however, did, not, regularly, send, permanent, legates, as, they, could, not, represent, the, interests, of, all, the, german, princes, who, were, in, theory, all, subordinate, to, the, emperor, but, in, practice, each, independent, between, 1500, and, 1700, rules, of, modern, diplomacy, were, further, developed, french, replaced, latin, from, about, 1715, the, top, rank, of, representatives, was, an, ambassador, at, that, time, an, ambassador, was, a, nobleman, the, rank, of, the, noble, assigned, varying, with, the, prestige, of, the, country, he, was, delegated, to, strict, standards, developed, for, ambassadors, requiring, they, have, large, residences, host, lavish, parties, and, play, an, important, role, in, the, court, life, of, their, host, nation, in, rome, the, most, prized, posting, for, a, catholic, ambassador, the, french, and, spanish, representatives, would, have, a, retinue, of, up, to, a, hundred, even, in, smaller, posts, ambassadors, were, very, expensive, smaller, states, would, send, and, receive, envoys, who, were, a, rung, below, ambassador, somewhere, between, the, two, was, the, position, of, minister, plenipotentiary, diplomacy, was, a, complex, affair, even, more, so, than, now, the, ambassadors, from, each, state, were, ranked, by, complex, levels, of, precedence, that, were, much, disputed, states, were, normally, ranked, by, the, title, of, the, sovereign, for, catholic, nations, the, emissary, from, the, vatican, was, paramount, then, those, from, the, kingdoms, then, those, from, duchies, and, principalities, representatives, from, republics, were, ranked, the, lowest, which, often, angered, the, leaders, of, the, numerous, german, scandinavian, and, italian, republics, determining, precedence, between, two, kingdoms, depended, on, a, number, of, factors, that, often, fluctuated, leading, to, near, constant, squabbling, ambassadors, were, often, nobles, with, little, foreign, experience, and, no, expectation, of, a, career, in, diplomacy, they, were, supported, by, their, embassy, staff, these, professionals, would, be, sent, on, longer, assignments, and, would, be, far, more, knowledgeable, than, the, higher, ranking, officials, about, the, host, country, embassy, staff, would, include, a, wide, range, of, employees, including, some, dedicated, to, espionage, the, need, for, skilled, individuals, to, staff, embassies, was, met, by, the, graduates, of, universities, and, this, led, to, a, great, increase, in, the, study, of, international, law, french, and, history, at, universities, throughout, europe, at, the, same, time, permanent, foreign, ministries, began, to, be, established, in, almost, all, european, states, to, coordinate, embassies, and, their, staffs, these, ministries, were, still, far, from, their, modern, form, and, many, of, them, had, extraneous, internal, responsibilities, britain, had, two, departments, with, frequently, overlapping, powers, until, 1782, they, were, also, far, smaller, than, they, are, currently, france, which, boasted, the, largest, foreign, affairs, department, had, only, some, 70, full, time, employees, in, the, 1780s, the, elements, of, modern, diplomacy, slowly, spread, to, eastern, europe, and, russia, arriving, by, the, early, 18th, century, the, entire, edifice, would, be, greatly, disrupted, by, the, french, revolution, and, the, subsequent, years, of, warfare, the, revolution, would, see, commoners, take, over, the, diplomacy, of, the, french, state, and, of, those, conquered, by, revolutionary, armies, ranks, of, precedence, were, abolished, napoleon, also, refused, to, acknowledge, diplomatic, immunity, imprisoning, several, british, diplomats, accused, of, scheming, against, france, after, the, fall, of, napoleon, the, congress, of, vienna, of, 1815, established, an, international, system, of, diplomatic, rank, disputes, on, precedence, among, nations, and, therefore, the, appropriate, diplomatic, ranks, used, were, first, addressed, at, the, congress, of, aix, la, chapelle, in, 1818, but, persisted, for, over, a, century, until, after, world, war, ii, when, the, rank, of, ambassador, became, the, norm, in, between, that, time, figures, such, as, the, german, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, were, renowned, for, international, diplomacy, diplomats, and, historians, often, refer, to, a, foreign, ministry, by, its, address, the, ballhausplatz, vienna, the, quai, d, orsay, paris, the, wilhelmstrasse, berlin, itamaraty, bras, lia, and, foggy, bottom, washington, d, c, for, the, russian, foreign, ministry, it, was, the, choristers, bridge, saint, petersburg, until, 1917, while, consulta, referred, to, the, italian, foreign, ministry, based, in, the, palazzo, della, consulta, rome, from, 1874, to, 1922, the, sanctity, of, diplomats, has, long, been, observed, underpinning, the, modern, concept, of, diplomatic, immunity, while, there, have, been, a, number, of, cases, where, diplomats, have, been, killed, this, is, normally, viewed, as, a, great, breach, of, honor, genghis, khan, and, the, mongols, were, well, known, for, strongly, insisting, on, the, rights, of, diplomats, and, they, would, often, wreak, horrific, vengeance, against, any, state, that, violated, these, rights, diplomatic, rights, were, established, in, the, mid, 17th, century, in, europe, and, have, spread, throughout, the, world, these, rights, were, formalized, by, the, 1961, vienna, convention, on, diplomatic, relations, which, protects, diplomats, from, being, persecuted, or, prosecuted, while, on, a, diplomatic, mission, if, a, diplomat, does, commit, a, serious, crime, while, in, a, host, country, he, or, she, may, be, declared, as, persona, non, grata, unwanted, person, such, diplomats, are, then, often, tried, for, the, crime, in, their, homeland, diplomatic, communications, are, also, viewed, as, sacrosanct, and, diplomats, have, long, been, allowed, to, carry, documents, across, borders, without, being, searched, the, mechanism, for, this, is, the, so, called, diplomatic, bag, or, in, some, countries, the, diplomatic, pouch, while, radio, and, digital, communication, have, become, more, standard, for, embassies, diplomatic, pouches, are, still, quite, common, and, some, countries, including, the, united, states, declare, entire, shipping, containers, as, diplomatic, pouches, to, bring, sensitive, material, often, building, supplies, into, a, country, in, times, of, hostility, diplomats, are, often, withdrawn, for, reasons, of, personal, safety, as, well, as, in, some, cases, when, the, host, country, is, friendly, but, there, is, a, perceived, threat, from, internal, dissidents, ambassadors, and, other, diplomats, are, sometimes, recalled, temporarily, by, their, home, countries, as, a, way, to, express, displeasure, with, the, host, country, in, both, cases, lower, level, employees, still, remain, to, actually, do, the, business, of, diplomacy, diplomacy, is, closely, linked, to, espionage, or, gathering, of, intelligence, embassies, are, bases, for, both, diplomats, and, spies, and, some, diplomats, are, essentially, openly, acknowledged, spies, for, instance, the, job, of, military, attach, s, includes, learning, as, much, as, possible, about, the, military, of, the, nation, to, which, they, are, assigned, they, do, not, try, to, hide, this, role, and, as, such, are, only, invited, to, events, allowed, by, their, hosts, such, as, military, parades, or, air, shows, there, are, also, deep, cover, spies, operating, in, many, embassies, these, individuals, are, given, fake, positions, at, the, embassy, but, their, main, task, is, to, illegally, gather, intelligence, usually, by, coordinating, spy, rings, of, locals, or, other, spies, for, the, most, part, spies, operating, out, of, embassies, gather, little, intelligence, themselves, and, their, identities, tend, to, be, known, by, the, opposition, if, discovered, these, diplomats, can, be, expelled, from, an, embassy, but, for, the, most, part, counter, intelligence, agencies, prefer, to, keep, these, agents, in, situ, and, under, close, monitoring, the, information, gathered, by, spies, plays, an, increasingly, important, role, in, diplomacy, arms, control, treaties, would, be, impossible, without, the, power, of, reconnaissance, satellites, and, agents, to, monitor, compliance, information, gleaned, from, espionage, is, useful, in, almost, all, forms, of, diplomacy, everything, from, trade, agreements, to, border, disputes, various, processes, and, procedures, have, evolved, over, time, for, handling, diplomatic, issues, and, disputes, nations, sometimes, resort, to, international, arbitration, when, faced, with, a, specific, question, or, point, of, contention, in, need, of, resolution, for, most, of, history, there, were, no, official, or, formal, procedures, for, such, proceedings, they, were, generally, accepted, to, abide, by, general, principles, and, protocols, related, to, international, law, and, justice, sometimes, these, took, the, form, of, formal, arbitrations, and, mediations, in, such, cases, a, commission, of, diplomats, might, be, convened, to, hear, all, sides, of, an, issue, and, to, come, some, sort, of, ruling, based, on, international, law, in, the, modern, era, much, of, this, work, is, often, carried, out, by, the, international, court, of, justice, at, the, hague, or, other, formal, commissions, agencies, and, tribunals, working, under, the, united, nations, below, are, some, examples, other, times, resolutions, were, sought, through, the, convening, of, international, conferences, in, such, cases, there, are, fewer, ground, rules, and, fewer, formal, applications, of, international, law, however, participants, are, expected, to, guide, themselves, through, principles, of, international, fairness, logic, and, protocol, some, examples, of, these, formal, conferences,
