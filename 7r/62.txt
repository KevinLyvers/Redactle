agriculture, encompasses, crop, and, livestock, production, aquaculture, and, forestry, for, food, and, non, food, products, agriculture, was, a, key, factor, in, the, rise, of, sedentary, human, civilization, whereby, farming, of, domesticated, species, created, food, surpluses, that, enabled, people, to, live, in, cities, while, humans, started, gathering, grains, at, least, 105, 000, years, ago, nascent, farmers, only, began, planting, them, around, 11, 500, years, ago, sheep, goats, pigs, and, cattle, were, domesticated, around, 10, 000, years, ago, plants, were, independently, cultivated, in, at, least, 11, regions, of, the, world, in, the, 20th, century, industrial, agriculture, based, on, large, scale, monocultures, came, to, dominate, agricultural, output, as, of, 2021, small, farms, produce, about, one, third, of, the, world, s, food, but, large, farms, are, prevalent, the, largest, 1, of, farms, in, the, world, are, greater, than, 50, hectares, 120, acres, and, operate, more, than, 70, of, the, world, s, farmland, nearly, 40, of, agricultural, land, is, found, on, farms, larger, than, 1, 000, hectares, 2, 500, acres, however, five, of, every, six, farms, in, the, world, consist, of, fewer, than, 2, hectares, 4, 9, acres, and, take, up, only, around, 12, of, all, agricultural, land, farms, and, farming, greatly, influence, rural, economics, and, greatly, shape, rural, society, effecting, both, the, direct, agricultural, workforce, and, broader, businesses, that, support, the, farms, and, farming, populations, the, major, agricultural, products, can, be, broadly, grouped, into, foods, fibers, fuels, and, raw, materials, such, as, rubber, food, classes, include, cereals, grains, vegetables, fruits, cooking, oils, meat, milk, eggs, and, fungi, global, agricultural, production, amounts, to, approximately, 11, billion, tonnes, of, food, 32, million, tonnes, of, natural, fibers, and, 4, billion, m, 3, of, wood, however, around, 14, of, the, world, s, food, is, lost, from, production, before, reaching, the, retail, level, modern, agronomy, plant, breeding, agrochemicals, such, as, pesticides, and, fertilizers, and, technological, developments, have, sharply, increased, crop, yields, but, also, contributed, to, ecological, and, environmental, damage, selective, breeding, and, modern, practices, in, animal, husbandry, have, similarly, increased, the, output, of, meat, but, have, raised, concerns, about, animal, welfare, and, environmental, damage, environmental, issues, include, contributions, to, climate, change, depletion, of, aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic, resistance, and, other, agricultural, pollution, agriculture, is, both, a, cause, of, and, sensitive, to, environmental, degradation, such, as, biodiversity, loss, desertification, soil, degradation, and, climate, change, all, of, which, can, cause, decreases, in, crop, yield, genetically, modified, organisms, are, widely, used, although, some, countries, ban, them, the, word, agriculture, is, a, late, middle, english, adaptation, of, latin, agricult, ra, from, ager, field, and, cult, ra, cultivation, or, growing, while, agriculture, usually, refers, to, human, activities, certain, species, of, ant, termite, and, beetle, have, been, cultivating, crops, for, up, to, 60, million, years, agriculture, is, defined, with, varying, scopes, in, its, broadest, sense, using, natural, resources, to, produce, commodities, which, maintain, life, including, food, fiber, forest, products, horticultural, crops, and, their, related, services, thus, defined, it, includes, arable, farming, horticulture, animal, husbandry, and, forestry, but, horticulture, and, forestry, are, in, practice, often, excluded, it, may, also, be, broadly, decomposed, into, plant, agriculture, which, concerns, the, cultivation, of, useful, plants, and, animal, agriculture, the, production, of, agricultural, animals, the, development, of, agriculture, enabled, the, human, population, to, grow, many, times, larger, than, could, be, sustained, by, hunting, and, gathering, agriculture, began, independently, in, different, parts, of, the, globe, and, included, a, diverse, range, of, taxa, in, at, least, 11, separate, centers, of, origin, wild, grains, were, collected, and, eaten, from, at, least, 105, 000, years, ago, in, the, paleolithic, levant, 23, 000, years, ago, cereals, cultivation, of, emmer, barley, and, oats, has, been, observed, near, the, sea, of, galilee, rice, was, domesticated, in, china, between, 11, 500, and, 6, 200, bc, with, the, earliest, known, cultivation, from, 5, 700, bc, followed, by, mung, soy, and, azuki, beans, sheep, were, domesticated, in, mesopotamia, between, 13, 000, and, 11, 000, years, ago, cattle, were, domesticated, from, the, wild, aurochs, in, the, areas, of, modern, turkey, and, pakistan, some, 10, 500, years, ago, pig, production, emerged, in, eurasia, including, europe, east, asia, and, southwest, asia, where, wild, boar, were, first, domesticated, about, 10, 500, years, ago, in, the, andes, of, south, america, the, potato, was, domesticated, between, 10, 000, and, 7, 000, years, ago, along, with, beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and, guinea, pigs, sugarcane, and, some, root, vegetables, were, domesticated, in, new, guinea, around, 9, 000, years, ago, sorghum, was, domesticated, in, the, sahel, region, of, africa, by, 7, 000, years, ago, cotton, was, domesticated, in, peru, by, 5, 600, years, ago, and, was, independently, domesticated, in, eurasia, in, mesoamerica, wild, teosinte, was, bred, into, maize, corn, from, 10, 000, to, 6, 000, years, ago, the, horse, was, domesticated, in, the, eurasian, steppes, around, 3500, bc, scholars, have, offered, multiple, hypotheses, to, explain, the, historical, origins, of, agriculture, studies, of, the, transition, from, hunter, gatherer, to, agricultural, societies, indicate, an, initial, period, of, intensification, and, increasing, sedentism, examples, are, the, natufian, culture, in, the, levant, and, the, early, chinese, neolithic, in, china, then, wild, stands, that, had, previously, been, harvested, started, to, be, planted, and, gradually, came, to, be, domesticated, in, eurasia, the, sumerians, started, to, live, in, villages, from, about, 8, 000, bc, relying, on, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, and, a, canal, system, for, irrigation, ploughs, appear, in, pictographs, around, 3, 000, bc, seed, ploughs, around, 2, 300, bc, farmers, grew, wheat, barley, vegetables, such, as, lentils, and, onions, and, fruits, including, dates, grapes, and, figs, ancient, egyptian, agriculture, relied, on, the, nile, river, and, its, seasonal, flooding, farming, started, in, the, predynastic, period, at, the, end, of, the, paleolithic, after, 10, 000, bc, staple, food, crops, were, grains, such, as, wheat, and, barley, alongside, industrial, crops, such, as, flax, and, papyrus, in, india, wheat, barley, and, jujube, were, domesticated, by, 9, 000, bc, soon, followed, by, sheep, and, goats, cattle, sheep, and, goats, were, domesticated, in, mehrgarh, culture, by, 8, 000, 6, 000, bc, cotton, was, cultivated, by, the, 5th, 4th, millennium, bc, archeological, evidence, indicates, an, animal, drawn, plough, from, 2, 500, bc, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, china, from, the, 5th, century, bc, there, was, a, nationwide, granary, system, and, widespread, silk, farming, water, powered, grain, mills, were, in, use, by, the, 1st, century, bc, followed, by, irrigation, by, the, late, 2nd, century, heavy, ploughs, had, been, developed, with, iron, ploughshares, and, mouldboards, these, spread, westwards, across, eurasia, asian, rice, was, domesticated, 8, 200, 13, 500, years, ago, depending, on, the, molecular, clock, estimate, that, is, used, on, the, pearl, river, in, southern, china, with, a, single, genetic, origin, from, the, wild, rice, oryza, rufipogon, in, greece, and, rome, the, major, cereals, were, wheat, emmer, and, barley, alongside, vegetables, including, peas, beans, and, olives, sheep, and, goats, were, kept, mainly, for, dairy, products, in, the, americas, crops, domesticated, in, mesoamerica, apart, from, teosinte, include, squash, beans, and, cacao, cocoa, was, domesticated, by, the, mayo, chinchipe, of, the, upper, amazon, around, 3, 000, bc, the, turkey, was, probably, domesticated, in, mexico, or, the, american, southwest, the, aztecs, developed, irrigation, systems, formed, terraced, hillsides, fertilized, their, soil, and, developed, chinampas, or, artificial, islands, the, mayas, used, extensive, canal, and, raised, field, systems, to, farm, swampland, from, 400, bc, in, south, america, agriculture, may, have, begun, about, 9000, bc, with, the, domestication, of, squash, cucurbita, and, other, plants, coca, was, domesticated, in, the, andes, as, were, the, peanut, tomato, tobacco, and, pineapple, cotton, was, domesticated, in, peru, by, 3, 600, bc, animals, including, llamas, alpacas, and, guinea, pigs, were, domesticated, there, in, north, america, the, indigenous, people, of, the, east, domesticated, crops, such, as, sunflower, tobacco, squash, and, chenopodium, wild, foods, including, wild, rice, and, maple, sugar, were, harvested, the, domesticated, strawberry, is, a, hybrid, of, a, chilean, and, a, north, american, species, developed, by, breeding, in, europe, and, north, america, the, indigenous, people, of, the, southwest, and, the, pacific, northwest, practiced, forest, gardening, and, fire, stick, farming, the, natives, controlled, fire, on, a, regional, scale, to, create, a, low, intensity, fire, ecology, that, sustained, a, low, density, agriculture, in, loose, rotation, a, sort, of, wild, permaculture, a, system, of, companion, planting, called, the, three, sisters, was, developed, in, north, america, the, three, crops, were, winter, squash, maize, and, climbing, beans, indigenous, australians, long, supposed, to, have, been, nomadic, hunter, gatherers, practiced, systematic, burning, possibly, to, enhance, natural, productivity, in, fire, stick, farming, scholars, have, pointed, out, that, hunter, gatherers, need, a, productive, environment, to, support, gathering, without, cultivation, because, the, forests, of, new, guinea, have, few, food, plants, early, humans, may, have, used, selective, burning, to, increase, the, productivity, of, the, wild, karuka, fruit, trees, to, support, the, hunter, gatherer, way, of, life, the, gunditjmara, and, other, groups, developed, eel, farming, and, fish, trapping, systems, from, some, 5, 000, years, ago, there, is, evidence, of, intensification, across, the, whole, continent, over, that, period, in, two, regions, of, australia, the, central, west, coast, and, eastern, central, early, farmers, cultivated, yams, native, millet, and, bush, onions, possibly, in, permanent, settlements, in, the, middle, ages, compared, to, the, roman, period, agriculture, in, western, europe, became, more, focused, on, self, sufficiency, the, agricultural, population, under, feudalism, was, typically, organized, into, manors, consisting, of, several, hundred, or, more, acres, of, land, presided, over, by, a, lord, of, the, manor, with, a, roman, catholic, church, and, priest, thanks, to, the, exchange, with, the, al, andalus, where, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, was, underway, european, agriculture, transformed, with, improved, techniques, and, the, diffusion, of, crop, plants, including, the, introduction, of, sugar, rice, cotton, and, fruit, trees, such, as, the, orange, after, 1492, the, columbian, exchange, brought, new, world, crops, such, as, maize, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet, potatoes, and, manioc, to, europe, and, old, world, crops, such, as, wheat, barley, rice, and, turnips, and, livestock, including, horses, cattle, sheep, and, goats, to, the, americas, irrigation, crop, rotation, and, fertilizers, advanced, from, the, 17th, century, with, the, british, agricultural, revolution, allowing, global, population, to, rise, significantly, since, 1900, agriculture, in, developed, nations, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, the, developing, world, has, seen, large, rises, in, productivity, as, mechanization, replaces, human, labor, and, assisted, by, synthetic, fertilizers, pesticides, and, selective, breeding, the, haber, bosch, method, allowed, the, synthesis, of, ammonium, nitrate, fertilizer, on, an, industrial, scale, greatly, increasing, crop, yields, and, sustaining, a, further, increase, in, global, population, modern, agriculture, has, raised, or, encountered, ecological, political, and, economic, issues, including, water, pollution, biofuels, genetically, modified, organisms, tariffs, and, farm, subsidies, leading, to, alternative, approaches, such, as, the, organic, movement, unsustainable, farming, practices, in, north, america, led, to, the, dust, bowl, of, the, 1930s, pastoralism, involves, managing, domesticated, animals, in, nomadic, pastoralism, herds, of, livestock, are, moved, from, place, to, place, in, search, of, pasture, fodder, and, water, this, type, of, farming, is, practiced, in, arid, and, semi, arid, regions, of, sahara, central, asia, and, some, parts, of, india, in, shifting, cultivation, a, small, area, of, forest, is, cleared, by, cutting, and, burning, the, trees, the, cleared, land, is, used, for, growing, crops, for, a, few, years, until, the, soil, becomes, too, infertile, and, the, area, is, abandoned, another, patch, of, land, is, selected, and, the, process, is, repeated, this, type, of, farming, is, practiced, mainly, in, areas, with, abundant, rainfall, where, the, forest, regenerates, quickly, this, practice, is, used, in, northeast, india, southeast, asia, and, the, amazon, basin, subsistence, farming, is, practiced, to, satisfy, family, or, local, needs, alone, with, little, left, over, for, transport, elsewhere, it, is, intensively, practiced, in, monsoon, asia, and, south, east, asia, an, estimated, 2, 5, billion, subsistence, farmers, worked, in, 2018, cultivating, about, 60, of, the, earth, s, arable, land, intensive, farming, is, cultivation, to, maximize, productivity, with, a, low, fallow, ratio, and, a, high, use, of, inputs, water, fertilizer, pesticide, and, automation, it, is, practiced, mainly, in, developed, countries, from, the, twentieth, century, onwards, intensive, agriculture, increased, crop, productivity, it, substituted, synthetic, fertilizers, and, pesticides, for, labour, but, caused, increased, water, pollution, and, often, involved, farm, subsidies, soil, degradation, and, diseases, such, as, stem, rust, are, major, concerns, globally, approximately, 40, of, the, world, s, agricultural, land, is, seriously, degraded, in, recent, years, there, has, been, a, backlash, against, the, environmental, effects, of, conventional, agriculture, resulting, in, the, organic, regenerative, and, sustainable, agriculture, movements, one, of, the, major, forces, behind, this, movement, has, been, the, european, union, which, first, certified, organic, food, in, 1991, and, began, reform, of, its, common, agricultural, policy, cap, in, 2005, to, phase, out, commodity, linked, farm, subsidies, also, known, as, decoupling, the, growth, of, organic, farming, has, renewed, research, in, alternative, technologies, such, as, integrated, pest, management, selective, breeding, and, controlled, environment, agriculture, there, are, concerns, about, the, lower, yield, associated, with, organic, farming, and, its, impact, on, global, food, security, recent, mainstream, technological, developments, include, genetically, modified, food, by, 2015, the, agricultural, output, of, china, was, the, largest, in, the, world, followed, by, the, european, union, india, and, the, united, states, economists, measure, the, total, factor, productivity, of, agriculture, according, to, which, agriculture, in, the, united, states, is, roughly, 1, 7, times, more, productive, than, it, was, in, 1948, agriculture, employed, 873, million, people, in, 2021, or, 27, of, the, global, workforce, compared, with, 1, 027, million, or, 40, in, 2000, the, share, of, agriculture, in, global, gdp, was, stable, at, around, 4, since, 2000, 2023, despite, increases, in, agricultural, production, and, productivity, between, 702, and, 828, million, people, were, affected, by, hunger, in, 2021, food, insecurity, and, malnutrition, can, be, the, result, of, conflict, climate, extremes, and, variability, and, economic, swings, it, can, also, be, caused, by, a, country, s, structural, characteristics, such, as, income, status, and, natural, resource, endowments, as, well, as, its, political, economy, pesticide, use, in, agriculture, went, up, 62, between, 2000, and, 2021, with, the, americas, accounting, for, half, the, use, in, 2021, the, international, fund, for, agricultural, development, posits, that, an, increase, in, smallholder, agriculture, may, be, part, of, the, solution, to, concerns, about, food, prices, and, overall, food, security, given, the, favorable, experience, of, vietnam, agriculture, provides, about, one, quarter, of, all, global, employment, more, than, half, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, almost, 60, percent, in, low, income, countries, as, countries, develop, other, jobs, have, historically, pulled, workers, away, from, agriculture, and, labor, saving, innovations, increase, agricultural, productivity, by, reducing, labor, requirements, per, unit, of, output, over, time, a, combination, of, labor, supply, and, labor, demand, trends, have, driven, down, the, share, of, population, employed, in, agriculture, during, the, 16th, century, in, europe, between, 55, and, 75, of, the, population, was, engaged, in, agriculture, by, the, 19th, century, this, had, dropped, to, between, 35, and, 65, in, the, same, countries, today, the, figure, is, less, than, 10, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, some, one, billion, people, or, over, 1, 3, of, the, available, work, force, were, employed, in, agriculture, this, constitutes, approximately, 70, of, the, global, employment, of, children, and, in, many, countries, constitutes, the, largest, percentage, of, women, of, any, industry, the, service, sector, overtook, the, agricultural, sector, as, the, largest, global, employer, in, 2007, in, many, developed, countries, immigrants, help, fill, labor, shortages, in, high, value, agriculture, activities, that, are, difficult, to, mechanize, foreign, farm, workers, from, mostly, eastern, europe, north, africa, and, south, asia, constituted, around, one, third, of, the, salaried, agricultural, workforce, in, spain, italy, greece, and, portugal, in, 2013, in, the, united, states, of, america, more, than, half, of, all, hired, farmworkers, roughly, 450, 000, workers, were, immigrants, in, 2019, although, the, number, of, new, immigrants, arriving, in, the, country, to, work, in, agriculture, has, fallen, by, 75, percent, in, recent, years, and, rising, wages, indicate, this, has, led, to, a, major, labor, shortage, on, u, s, farms, around, the, world, women, make, up, a, large, share, of, the, population, employed, in, agriculture, this, share, is, growing, in, all, developing, regions, except, east, and, southeast, asia, where, women, already, make, up, about, 50, percent, of, the, agricultural, workforce, women, make, up, 47, percent, of, the, agricultural, workforce, in, sub, saharan, africa, a, rate, that, has, not, changed, significantly, in, the, past, few, decades, however, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, united, nations, fao, posits, that, the, roles, and, responsibilities, of, women, in, agriculture, may, be, changing, for, example, from, subsistence, farming, to, wage, employment, and, from, contributing, household, members, to, primary, producers, in, the, context, of, male, out, migration, in, general, women, account, for, a, greater, share, of, agricultural, employment, at, lower, levels, of, economic, development, as, inadequate, education, limited, access, to, basic, infrastructure, and, markets, high, unpaid, work, burden, and, poor, rural, employment, opportunities, outside, agriculture, severely, limit, women, s, opportunities, for, off, farm, work, women, who, work, in, agricultural, production, tend, to, do, so, under, highly, unfavorable, conditions, they, tend, to, be, concentrated, in, the, poorest, countries, where, alternative, livelihoods, are, not, available, and, they, maintain, the, intensity, of, their, work, in, conditions, of, climate, induced, weather, shocks, and, in, situations, of, conflict, women, are, less, likely, to, participate, as, entrepreneurs, and, independent, farmers, and, are, engaged, in, the, production, of, less, lucrative, crops, the, gender, gap, in, land, productivity, between, female, and, male, managed, farms, of, the, same, size, is, 24, percent, on, average, women, earn, 18, 4, percent, less, than, men, in, wage, employment, in, agriculture, this, means, that, women, receive, 82, cents, for, every, dollar, earned, by, men, progress, has, been, slow, in, closing, gaps, in, women, s, access, to, irrigation, and, in, ownership, of, livestock, too, women, in, agriculture, still, have, significantly, less, access, than, men, to, inputs, including, improved, seeds, fertilizers, and, mechanized, equipment, on, a, positive, note, the, gender, gap, in, access, to, mobile, internet, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, fell, from, 25, percent, to, 16, percent, between, 2017, and, 2021, and, the, gender, gap, in, access, to, bank, accounts, narrowed, from, 9, to, 6, percentage, points, women, are, as, likely, as, men, to, adopt, new, technologies, when, the, necessary, enabling, factors, are, put, in, place, and, they, have, equal, access, to, complementary, resources, agriculture, specifically, farming, remains, a, hazardous, industry, and, farmers, worldwide, remain, at, high, risk, of, work, related, injuries, lung, disease, noise, induced, hearing, loss, skin, diseases, as, well, as, certain, cancers, related, to, chemical, use, and, prolonged, sun, exposure, on, industrialized, farms, injuries, frequently, involve, the, use, of, agricultural, machinery, and, a, common, cause, of, fatal, agricultural, injuries, in, developed, countries, is, tractor, rollovers, pesticides, and, other, chemicals, used, in, farming, can, be, hazardous, to, worker, health, and, workers, exposed, to, pesticides, may, experience, illness, or, have, children, with, birth, defects, as, an, industry, in, which, families, commonly, share, in, work, and, live, on, the, farm, itself, entire, families, can, be, at, risk, for, injuries, illness, and, death, ages, 0, 6, may, be, an, especially, vulnerable, population, in, agriculture, common, causes, of, fatal, injuries, among, young, farm, workers, include, drowning, machinery, and, motor, accidents, including, with, all, terrain, vehicles, the, international, labour, organization, considers, agriculture, one, of, the, most, hazardous, of, all, economic, sectors, it, estimates, that, the, annual, work, related, death, toll, among, agricultural, employees, is, at, least, 170, 000, twice, the, average, rate, of, other, jobs, in, addition, incidences, of, death, injury, and, illness, related, to, agricultural, activities, often, go, unreported, the, organization, has, developed, the, safety, and, health, in, agriculture, convention, 2001, which, covers, the, range, of, risks, in, the, agriculture, occupation, the, prevention, of, these, risks, and, the, role, that, individuals, and, organizations, engaged, in, agriculture, should, play, in, the, united, states, agriculture, has, been, identified, by, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, as, a, priority, industry, sector, in, the, national, occupational, research, agenda, to, identify, and, provide, intervention, strategies, for, occupational, health, and, safety, issues, in, the, european, union, the, european, agency, for, safety, and, health, at, work, has, issued, guidelines, on, implementing, health, and, safety, directives, in, agriculture, livestock, farming, horticulture, and, forestry, the, agricultural, safety, and, health, council, of, america, ashca, also, holds, a, yearly, summit, to, discuss, safety, overall, production, varies, by, country, as, listed, the, twenty, largest, countries, by, agricultural, output, in, nominal, terms, at, peak, level, as, of, 2018, according, to, the, imf, and, cia, world, factbook, cropping, systems, vary, among, farms, depending, on, the, available, resources, and, constraints, geography, and, climate, of, the, farm, government, policy, economic, social, and, political, pressures, and, the, philosophy, and, culture, of, the, farmer, shifting, cultivation, or, slash, and, burn, is, a, system, in, which, forests, are, burnt, releasing, nutrients, to, support, cultivation, of, annual, and, then, perennial, crops, for, a, period, of, several, years, then, the, plot, is, left, fallow, to, regrow, forest, and, the, farmer, moves, to, a, new, plot, returning, after, many, more, years, 10, 20, this, fallow, period, is, shortened, if, population, density, grows, requiring, the, input, of, nutrients, fertilizer, or, manure, and, some, manual, pest, control, annual, cultivation, is, the, next, phase, of, intensity, in, which, there, is, no, fallow, period, this, requires, even, greater, nutrient, and, pest, control, inputs, further, industrialization, led, to, the, use, of, monocultures, when, one, cultivar, is, planted, on, a, large, acreage, because, of, the, low, biodiversity, nutrient, use, is, uniform, and, pests, tend, to, build, up, necessitating, the, greater, use, of, pesticides, and, fertilizers, multiple, cropping, in, which, several, crops, are, grown, sequentially, in, one, year, and, intercropping, when, several, crops, are, grown, at, the, same, time, are, other, kinds, of, annual, cropping, systems, known, as, polycultures, in, subtropical, and, arid, environments, the, timing, and, extent, of, agriculture, may, be, limited, by, rainfall, either, not, allowing, multiple, annual, crops, in, a, year, or, requiring, irrigation, in, all, of, these, environments, perennial, crops, are, grown, coffee, chocolate, and, systems, are, practiced, such, as, agroforestry, in, temperate, environments, where, ecosystems, were, predominantly, grassland, or, prairie,

for, producing, livestock, with, the, sector, employing, approximately, 1, 3, billion, people, between, the, 1960s, and, the, 2000s, there, was, a, significant, increase, in, livestock, production, both, by, numbers, and, by, carcass, weight, especially, among, beef, pigs, and, chickens, the, latter, of, which, had, production, increased, by, almost, a, factor, of, 10, non, meat, animals, such, as, milk, cows, and, egg, producing, chickens, also, showed, significant, production, increases, global, cattle, sheep, and, goat, populations, are, expected, to, continue, to, increase, sharply, through, 2050, aquaculture, or, fish, farming, the, production, of, fish, for, human, consumption, in, confined, operations, is, one, of, the, fastest, growing, sectors, of, food, production, growing, at, an, average, of, 9, a, year, between, 1975, and, 2007, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, producers, using, selective, breeding, focused, on, creating, livestock, breeds, and, crossbreeds, that, increased, production, while, mostly, disregarding, the, need, to, preserve, genetic, diversity, this, trend, has, led, to, a, significant, decrease, in, genetic, diversity, and, resources, among, livestock, breeds, leading, to, a, corresponding, decrease, in, disease, resistance, and, local, adaptations, previously, found, among, traditional, breeds, grassland, based, livestock, production, relies, upon, plant, material, such, as, shrubland, rangeland, and, pastures, for, feeding, ruminant, animals, outside, nutrient, inputs, may, be, used, however, manure, is, returned, directly, to, the, grassland, as, a, major, nutrient, source, this, system, is, particularly, important, in, areas, where, crop, production, is, not, feasible, because, of, climate, or,

of, the, global, supplies, of, poultry, and, pork, scientists, estimate, that, 75, of, the, growth, in, livestock, production, between, 2003, and, 2030, will, be, in, confined, animal, feeding, operations, sometimes, called, factory, farming, much, of, this, growth, is, happening, in, developing, countries, in, asia, with, much, smaller, amounts, of, growth, in, africa, some, of, the, practices, used, in, commercial, livestock, production, including, the, usage, of, growth, hormones, are, controversial, tillage, is, the, practice, of, breaking, up, the, soil, with, tools, such, as, the, plow, or, harrow, to, prepare, for, planting, for, nutrient, incorporation, or, for, pest, control, tillage, varies, in, intensity, from, conventional, to, no, till, it, can, improve, productivity, by, warming, the, soil, incorporating, fertilizer, and, controlling, weeds, but, also, renders, soil, more, prone, to, erosion, triggers, the, decomposition, of, organic, matter,

rotation, or, a, fallow, period, manure, is, used, either, by, holding, livestock, where, the, feed, crop, is, growing, such, as, in, managed, intensive, rotational, grazing, or, by, spreading, either, dry, or, liquid, formulations, of, manure, on, cropland, or, pastures, water, management, is, needed, where, rainfall, is, insufficient, or, variable, which, occurs, to, some, degree, in, most, regions, of, the, world, some, farmers, use, irrigation, to, supplement, rainfall, in, other, areas, such, as, the, great, plains, in, the, u, s, and, canada, farmers, use, a, fallow, year, to, conserve, soil, moisture, for, the, following, year, recent, technological, innovations, in, precision, agriculture, allow, for, water, status, monitoring, and, automate, water, usage, leading, to, more, efficient, management, agriculture, represents, 70, of, freshwater, use, worldwide, however, water, withdrawal, ratios, for, agriculture, vary, significantly, by, income, level, in, least, developed, countries, and, landlocked, developing, countries, water, withdrawal, ratios, for, agriculture, are, as, high, as, 90, percent, of, total, water, withdrawals, and, about, 60, percent, in, small, island, developing, states, according, to, 2014, report, by, the, international, food, policy, research, institute, agricultural, technologies, will, have, the, greatest, impact, on, food, production, if, adopted, in, combination, with, each, other, using, a, model, that, assessed, how, eleven, technologies, could, impact, agricultural, productivity, food, security, and, trade, by, 2050, the, international, food, policy, research, institute, found, that, the, number, of, people, at, risk, from, hunger, could, be, reduced, by, as, much, as, 40, and, food, prices, could, be, reduced, by, almost, half, payment, for, ecosystem, services, is, a, method, of, providing, additional, incentives, to, encourage, farmers, to, conserve, some, aspects, of, the, environment, measures, might, include, paying, for, reforestation, upstream, of, a, city, to, improve, the, supply, of, fresh, water, different, definitions, exist, for, agricultural, automation, and, for, the, variety, of, tools, and, technologies, that, are, used, to, automate, production, one, view, is, that, agricultural, automation, refers, to, autonomous, navigation, by, robots, without, human, intervention, alternatively, it, is, defined, as, the, accomplishment, of, production, tasks, through, mobile, autonomous, decision, making, mechatronic, devices, however, fao, finds, that, these, definitions, do, not, capture, all, the, aspects, and, forms, of, automation, such, as, robotic, milking, machines, that, are, static, most, motorized, machinery, that, automates, the, performing, of, agricultural, operations, and, digital, tools, e, g, sensors, that, automate, only, diagnosis, fao, defines, agricultural, automation, as, the, use, of, machinery, and, equipment, in, agricultural, operations, to, improve, their, diagnosis, decision, making, or, performing, reducing, the, drudgery, of, agricultural, work, or, improving, the, timeliness, and, potentially, the, precision, of, agricultural, operations, the, technological, evolution, in, agriculture, has, involved, a, progressive, move, from, manual, tools, to, animal, traction, to, motorized, mechanization, to, digital, equipment, and, finally, to, robotics, with, artificial, intelligence, ai, motorized, mechanization, using, engine, power, automates, the, performance, of, agricultural, operations, such, as, ploughing, and, milking, with, digital, automation, technologies, it, also, becomes, possible, to, automate, diagnosis, and, decision, making, of, agricultural, operations, for, example, autonomous, crop, robots, can, harvest, and, seed, crops, while, drones, can, gather, information, to, help, automate, input, application, precision, agriculture, often, employs, such, automation, technologies, motorized, machines, are, increasingly, complemented, or, even, superseded, by, new, digital, equipment, that, automates, diagnosis, and, decision, making, a, conventional, tractor, for, example, can, be, converted, into, an, automated, vehicle, allowing, it, to, sow, a, field, autonomously, motorized, mechanization, has, increased, significantly, across, the, world, in, recent, years, although, reliable, global, data, with, broad, country, coverage, exist, only, for, tractors, and, only, up, to, 2009, sub, saharan, africa, is, the, only, region, where, the, adoption, of, motorized, mechanization, has, stalled, over, the, past, decades, automation, technologies, are, increasingly, used, for, managing, livestock, though, evidence, on, adoption, is, lacking, global, automatic, milking, system, sales, have, increased, over, recent, years, but, adoption, is, likely, mostly, in, northern, europe, and, likely, almost, absent, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, automated, feeding, machines, for, both, cows, and, poultry, also, exist, but, data, and, evidence, regarding, their, adoption, trends, and, drivers, is, likewise, scarce, measuring, the, overall, employment, impacts, of, agricultural, automation, is, difficult, because, it, requires, large, amounts, of, data, tracking, all, the, transformations, and, the, associated, reallocation, of, workers, both, upstream, and, downstream, while, automation, technologies, reduce, labor, needs, for, the, newly, automated, tasks, they, also, generate, new, labor, demand, for, other, tasks, such, as, equipment, maintenance, and, operation, agricultural, automation, can, also, stimulate, employment, by, allowing, producers, to, expand, production, and, by, creating, other, agrifood, systems, jobs, this, is, especially, true, when, it, happens, in, context, of, rising, scarcity, of, rural, labor, as, is, the, case, in, high, income, countries, and, many, middle, income, countries, on, the, other, hand, if, forcedly, promoted, for, example, through, government, subsidies, in, contexts, of, abundant, rural, labor, it, can, lead, to, labor, displacement, and, falling, or, stagnant, wages, particularly, affecting, poor, and, low, skilled, workers, climate, change, and, agriculture, are, interrelated, on, a, global, scale, climate, change, affects, agriculture, through, changes, in, average, temperatures, rainfall, and, weather, extremes, like, storms, and, heat, waves, changes, in, pests, and, diseases, changes, in, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, and, ground, level, ozone, concentrations, changes, in, the, nutritional, quality, of, some, foods, and, changes, in, sea, level, global, warming, is, already, affecting, agriculture, with, effects, unevenly, distributed, across, the, world, in, a, 2022, report, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, describes, how, human, induced, warming, has, slowed, growth, of, agricultural, productivity, over, the, past, 50, years, in, mid, and, low, latitudes, methane, emissions, have, negatively, impacted, crop, yields, by, increasing, temperatures, and, surface, ozone, concentrations, warming, is, also, negatively, affecting, crop, and, grassland, quality, and, harvest, stability, ocean, warming, has, decreased, sustainable, yields, of, some, wild, fish, populations, while, ocean, acidification, and, warming, have, already, affected, farmed, aquatic, species, climate, change, will, probably, increase, the, risk, of, food, insecurity, for, some, vulnerable, groups, such, as, the, poor, crop, alteration, has, been, practiced, by, humankind, for, thousands, of, years, since, the, beginning, of, civilization, altering, crops, through, breeding, practices, changes, the, genetic, make, up, of, a, plant, to, develop, crops, with, more, beneficial, characteristics, for, humans, for, example, larger, fruits, or, seeds, drought, tolerance, or, resistance, to, pests, significant, advances, in, plant, breeding, ensued, after, the, work, of, geneticist, gregor, mendel, his, work, on, dominant, and, recessive, alleles, although, initially, largely, ignored, for, almost, 50, years, gave, plant, breeders, a, better, understanding, of, genetics, and, breeding, techniques, crop, breeding, includes, techniques, such, as, plant, selection, with, desirable, traits, self, pollination, and, cross, pollination, and, molecular, techniques, that, genetically, modify, the, organism, domestication, of, plants, has, over, the, centuries, increased, yield, improved, disease, resistance, and, drought, tolerance, eased, harvest, and, improved, the, taste, and, nutritional, value, of, crop, plants, careful, selection, and, breeding, have, had, enormous, effects, on, the, characteristics, of, crop, plants, plant, selection, and, breeding, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, improved, pasture, grasses, and, clover, in, new, zealand, extensive, x, ray, and, ultraviolet, induced, mutagenesis, efforts, i, e, primitive, genetic, engineering, during, the, 1950s, produced, the, modern, commercial, varieties, of, grains, such, as, wheat, corn, maize, and, barley, the, green, revolution, popularized, the, use, of, conventional, hybridization, to, sharply, increase, yield, by, creating, high, yielding, varieties, for, example, average, yields, of, corn, maize, in, the, us, have, increased, from, around, 2, 5, tons, per, hectare, t, ha, 40, bushels, per, acre, in, 1900, to, about, 9, 4, t, ha, 150, bushels, per, acre, in, 2001, similarly, worldwide, average, wheat, yields, have, increased, from, less, than, 1, t, ha, in, 1900, to, more, than, 2, 5, t, ha, in, 1990, south, american, average, wheat, yields, are, around, 2, t, ha, african, under, 1, t, ha, and, egypt, and, arabia, up, to, 3, 5, to, 4, t, ha, with, irrigation, in, contrast, the, average, wheat, yield, in, countries, such, as, france, is, over, 8, t, ha, variations, in, yields, are, due, mainly, to, variation, in, climate, genetics, and, the, level, of, intensive, farming, techniques, use, of, fertilizers, chemical, pest, control, and, growth, control, to, avoid, lodging, investments, into, innovation, for, agriculture, are, long, term, this, is, because, it, takes, time, for, research, to, become, commercialized, and, for, technology, to, be, adapted, to, meet, multiple, regions, needs, as, well, as, meet, national, guidelines, before, being, adopted, and, planted, in, a, farmer, s, fields, for, instance, it, took, at, least, 60, years, from, the, introduction, of, hybrid, corn, technology, before, its, adoption, became, widespread, agricultural, innovation, developed, for, the, specific, agroecological, conditions, of, one, region, is, not, easily, transferred, and, used, in, another, region, with, different, agroecological, conditions, instead, the, innovation, would, have, to, be, adapted, to, the, specific, conditions, of, that, other, region, and, respect, its, biodiversity, and, environmental, requirements, and, guidelines, some, such, adaptations, can, be, seen, through, the, steadily, increasing, number, of, plant, varieties, protected, under, the, plant, variety, protection, instrument, administered, by, the, international, union, for, the, protection, of, new, varieties, of, plants, upov, genetically, modified, organisms, gmo, are, organisms, whose, genetic, material, has, been, altered, by, genetic, engineering, techniques, generally, known, as, recombinant, dna, technology, genetic, engineering, has, expanded, the, genes, available, to, breeders, to, use, in, creating, desired, germlines, for, new, crops, increased, durability, nutritional, content, insect, and, virus, resistance, and, herbicide, tolerance, are, a, few, of, the, attributes, bred, into, crops, through, genetic, engineering, for, some, gmo, crops, cause, food, safety, and, food, labeling, concerns, numerous, countries, have, placed, restrictions, on, the, production, import, or, use, of, gmo, foods, and, crops, the, biosafety, protocol, an, international, treaty, regulates, the, trade, of, gmos, there, is, ongoing, discussion, regarding, the, labeling, of, foods, made, from, gmos, and, while, the, eu, currently, requires, all, gmo, foods, to, be, labeled, the, us, does, not, herbicide, resistant, seeds, have, a, gene, implanted, into, their, genome, that, allows, the, plants, to, tolerate, exposure, to, herbicides, including, glyphosate, these, seeds, allow, the, farmer, to, grow, a, crop, that, can, be, sprayed, with, herbicides, to, control, weeds, without, harming, the, resistant, crop, herbicide, tolerant, crops, are, used, by, farmers, worldwide, with, the, increasing, use, of, herbicide, tolerant, crops, comes, an, increase, in, the, use, of, glyphosate, based, herbicide, sprays, in, some, areas, glyphosate, resistant, weeds, have, developed, causing, farmers, to, switch, to, other, herbicides, some, studies, also, link, widespread, glyphosate, usage, to, iron, deficiencies, in, some, crops, which, is, both, a, crop, production, and, a, nutritional, quality, concern, with, potential, economic, and, health, implications, other, gmo, crops, used, by, growers, include, insect, resistant, crops, which, have, a, gene, from, the, soil, bacterium, bacillus, thuringiensis, bt, which, produces, a, toxin, specific, to, insects, these, crops, resist, damage, by, insects, some, believe, that, similar, or, better, pest, resistance, traits, can, be, acquired, through, traditional, breeding, practices, and, resistance, to, various, pests, can, be, gained, through, hybridization, or, cross, pollination, with, wild, species, in, some, cases, wild, species, are, the, primary, source, of, resistance, traits, some, tomato, cultivars, that, have, gained, resistance, to, at, least, 19, diseases, did, so, through, crossing, with, wild, populations, of, tomatoes, agriculture, is, both, a, cause, of, and, sensitive, to, environmental, degradation, such, as, biodiversity, loss, desertification, soil, degradation, and, climate, change, which, cause, decreases, in, crop, yield, agriculture, is, one, of, the, most, important, drivers, of, environmental, pressures, particularly, habitat, change, climate, change, water, use, and, toxic, emissions, agriculture, is, the, main, source, of, toxins, released, into, the, environment, including, insecticides, especially, those, used, on, cotton, the, 2011, unep, green, economy, report, stated, that, agricultural, operations, produced, some, 13, per, cent, of, anthropogenic, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, this, includes, gases, from, the, use, of, inorganic, fertilizers, agro, chemical, pesticides, and, herbicides, as, well, as, fossil, fuel, energy, inputs, agriculture, imposes, multiple, external, costs, upon, society, through, effects, such, as, pesticide, damage, to, nature, especially, herbicides, and, insecticides, nutrient, runoff, excessive, water, usage, and, loss, of, natural, environment, a, 2000, assessment, of, agriculture, in, the, uk, determined, total, external, costs, for, 1996, of, 2, 343, million, or, 208, per, hectare, a, 2005, analysis, of, these, costs, in, the, us, concluded, that, cropland, imposes, approximately, 5, to, 16, billion, 30, to, 96, per, hectare, while, livestock, production, imposes, 714, million, both, studies, which, focused, solely, on, the, fiscal, impacts, concluded, that, more, should, be, done, to, internalize, external, costs, neither, included, subsidies, in, their, analysis, but, they, noted, that, subsidies, also, influence, the, cost, of, agriculture, to, society, agriculture, seeks, to, increase, yield, and, to, reduce, costs, often, employing, measures, that, cut, biodiversity, to, very, low, levels, yield, increases, with, inputs, such, as, fertilizers, and, removal, of, pathogens, predators, and, competitors, such, as, weeds, costs, decrease, with, increasing, scale, of, farm, units, such, as, making, fields, larger, this, means, removing, hedges, ditches, and, other, areas, of, habitat, pesticides, kill, insects, plants, and, fungi, effective, yields, fall, with, on, farm, losses, which, may, be, caused, by, poor, production, practices, during, harvesting, handling, and, storage, the, environmental, effects, of, climate, change, show, that, research, on, pests, and, diseases, that, do, not, generally, afflict, areas, is, essential, in, 2021, farmers, discovered, stem, rust, on, wheat, in, the, champagne, area, of, france, a, disease, that, had, previously, only, occurred, in, morocco, for, 20, to, 30, years, because, of, climate, change, insects, that, used, to, die, off, over, the, winter, are, now, alive, and, multiplying, a, senior, un, official, henning, steinfeld, said, that, livestock, are, one, of, the, most, significant, contributors, to, today, s, most, serious, environmental, problems, livestock, production, occupies, 70, of, all, land, used, for, agriculture, or, 30, of, the, land, surface, of, the, planet, it, is, one, of, the, largest, sources, of, greenhouse, gases, responsible, for, 18, of, the, world, s, greenhouse, gas, emissions, as, measured, in, co, 2, equivalents, by, comparison, all, transportation, emits, 13, 5, of, the, co, 2, it, produces, 65, of, human, related, nitrous, oxide, which, has, 296, times, the, global, warming, potential, of, co, 2, and, 37, of, all, human, induced, methane, which, is, 23, times, as, warming, as, co, 2, it, also, generates, 64, of, the, ammonia, emission, livestock, expansion, is, cited, as, a, key, factor, driving, deforestation, in, the, amazon, basin, 70, of, previously, forested, area, is, now, occupied, by, pastures, and, the, remainder, used, for, feed, crops, through, deforestation, and, land, degradation, livestock, is, also, driving, reductions, in, biodiversity, a, well, documented, phenomenon, is, woody, plant, encroachment, caused, by, overgrazing, in, rangelands, furthermore, the, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, states, that, methane, emissions, from, global, livestock, are, projected, to, increase, by, 60, per, cent, by, 2030, under, current, practices, and, consumption, patterns, land, transformation, the, use, of, land, to, yield, goods, and, services, is, the, most, substantial, way, humans, alter, the, earth, s, ecosystems, and, is, the, driving, force, causing, biodiversity, loss, estimates, of, the, amount, of, land, transformed, by, humans, vary, from, 39, to, 50, it, is, estimated, that, 24, of, land, globally, experiences, land, degradation, a, long, term, decline, in, ecosystem, function, and, productivity, with, cropland, being, disproportionately, affected, land, management, is, the, driving, factor, behind, degradation, 1, 5, billion, people, rely, upon, the, degrading, land, degradation, can, be, through, deforestation, desertification, soil, erosion, mineral, depletion, acidification, or, salinization, in, 2021, the, global, agricultural, land, area, was, 4, 79, billion, hectares, ha, down, 2, percent, or, 0, 09, billion, ha, compared, with, 2000, between, 2000, and, 2021, roughly,

manure, application, to, cropland, as, well, as, high, livestock, stocking, densities, cause, nutrient, mainly, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, runoff, and, leaching, from, agricultural, land, these, nutrients, are, major, nonpoint, pollutants, contributing, to, eutrophication, of, aquatic, ecosystems, and, pollution, of, groundwater, with, harmful, effects, on, human, populations, fertilizers, also, reduce, terrestrial, biodiversity, by, increasing, competition, for, light, favoring, those, species, that, are, able, to, benefit, from, the, added, nutrients, agriculture, simultaneously, is, facing, growing, freshwater, demand, and, precipitation, anomalies, droughts, floods, and, extreme, rainfall, and, weather, events, on, rainfed, areas, fields, and, grazing, lands, agriculture, accounts, for, 70, percent, of, withdrawals, of, freshwater, resources, and, an, estimated, 41, percent, of, current, global, irrigation, water, use, occurs, at, the, expense, of, environmental, flow, requirements, it, is, long, known, that, aquifers, in, areas, as, diverse, as, northern, china, the, upper, ganges, and, the, western, us, are, being, depleted, and, new, research, extends, these, problems, to, aquifers, in, iran, mexico, and, saudi, arabia, increasing, pressure, is, being, placed, on, water, resources, by, industry, and, urban, areas, meaning, that, water, scarcity, is, increasing, and, agriculture, is, facing, the, challenge, of, producing, more, food, for, the, world, s, growing, population, with, reduced, water, resources, while, industrial, withdrawals, have, declined, in, the, past, few, decades, and, municipal, withdrawals, have, increased, only, marginally, since, 2010, agricultural, withdrawals, have, continued, to, grow, at, an, ever, faster, pace, agricultural, water, usage, can, also, cause, major, environmental, problems, including, the, destruction, of, natural, wetlands, the, spread, of, water, borne, diseases, and, land, degradation, through, salinization, and, waterlogging, when, irrigation, is, performed, incorrectly, pesticide, use, has, increased, since, 1950, to, 2, 5, million, short, tons, annually, worldwide, yet, crop, loss, from, pests, has, remained, relatively, constant, the, world, health, organization, estimated, in, 1992, that, three, million, pesticide, poisonings, occur, annually, causing, 220, 000, deaths, pesticides, select, for, pesticide, resistance, in, the, pest, population, leading, to, a, condition, termed, the, pesticide, treadmill, in, which, pest, resistance, warrants, the, development, of, a, new, pesticide, an, alternative, argument, is, that, the, way, to, save, the, environment, and, prevent, famine, is, by, using, pesticides, and, intensive, high, yield, farming, a, view, exemplified, by, a, quote, heading, the, center, for, global, food, issues, website, growing, more, per, acre, leaves, more, land, for, nature, however, critics, argue, that, a, trade, off, between, the, environment, and, a, need, for, food, is, not, inevitable, and, that, pesticides, can, replace, good, agronomic, practices, such, as, crop, rotation, the, push, pull, agricultural, pest, management, technique, involves, intercropping, using, plant, aromas, to, repel, pests, from, crops, push, and, to, lure, them, to, a, place, from, which, they, can, then, be, removed, pull, agriculture, contributes, towards, climate, change, through, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, by, the, conversion, of, non, agricultural, land, such, as, forests, into, agricultural, land, the, agriculture, forestry, and, land, use, sector, contribute, between, 13, and, 21, of, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, emissions, of, nitrous, oxide, methane, make, up, over, half, of, total, greenhouse, gas, emission, from, agriculture, animal, husbandry, is, a, major, source, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, approximately, 57, of, global, ghg, emissions, from, the, production, of, food, are, from, the, production, of, animal, based, food, while, plant, based, foods, contribute, 29, and, the, remaining, 14, is, for, other, utilizations, farmland, management, and, land, use, change, represented, major, shares, of, total, emissions, 38, and, 29, respectively, whereas, rice, and, beef, were, the, largest, contributing, plant, and, animal, based, commodities, 12, and, 25, respectively, south, and, southeast, asia, and, south, america, were, the, largest, emitters, of, production, based, ghgs, current, farming, methods, have, resulted, in, over, stretched, water, resources, high, levels, of, erosion, and, reduced, soil, fertility, there, is, not, enough, water, to, continue, farming, using, current, practices, therefore, how, water, land, and, ecosystem, resources, are, used, to, boost, crop, yields, must, be, reconsidered, a, solution, would, be, to, give, value, to, ecosystems, recognizing, environmental, and, livelihood, tradeoffs, and, balancing, the, rights, of, a, variety, of, users, and, interests, inequities, that, result, when, such, measures, are, adopted, would, need, to, be, addressed, such, as, the, reallocation, of, water, from, poor, to, rich, the, clearing, of, land, to, make, way, for, more, productive, farmland, or, the, preservation, of, a, wetland, system, that, limits, fishing, rights, technological, advancements, help, provide, farmers, with, tools, and, resources, to, make, farming, more, sustainable, technology, permits, innovations, like, conservation, tillage, a, farming, process, which, helps, prevent, land, loss, to, erosion, reduces, water, pollution, and, enhances, carbon, sequestration, agricultural, automation, can, help, address, some, of, the, challenges, associated, with, climate, change, and, thus, facilitate, adaptation, efforts, for, example, the, application, of, digital, automation, technologies, e, g, in, precision, agriculture, can, improve, resource, use, efficiency, in, conditions, which, are, increasingly, constrained, for, agricultural, producers, moreover, when, applied, to, sensing, and, early, warning, they, can, help, address, the, uncertainty, and, unpredictability, of, weather, conditions, associated, with, accelerating, climate, change, other, potential, sustainable, practices, include, conservation, agriculture, agroforestry, improved, grazing, avoided, grassland, conversion, and, biochar, current, mono, crop, farming, practices, in, the, united, states, preclude, widespread, adoption, of, sustainable, practices, such, as, 2, 3, crop, rotations, that, incorporate, grass, or, hay, with, annual, crops, unless, negative, emission, goals, such, as, soil, carbon, sequestration, become, policy, the, food, demand, of, earth, s, projected, population, with, current, climate, change, predictions, could, be, satisfied, by, improvement, of, agricultural, methods, expansion, of, agricultural, areas, and, a, sustainability, oriented, consumer, mindset, since, the, 1940s, agricultural, productivity, has, increased, dramatically, due, largely, to, the, increased, use, of, energy, intensive, mechanization, fertilizers, and, pesticides, the, vast, majority, of, this, energy, input, comes, from, fossil, fuel, sources, between, the, 1960s, and, the, 1980s, the, green, revolution, transformed, agriculture, around, the, globe, with, world, grain, production, increasing, significantly, between, 70, and, 390, for, wheat, and, 60, to, 150, for, rice, depending, on, geographic, area, as, world, population, doubled, heavy, reliance, on, petrochemicals, has, raised, concerns, that, oil, shortages, could, increase, costs, and, reduce, agricultural, output, industrialized, agriculture, depends, on, fossil, fuels, in, two, fundamental, ways, direct, consumption, on, the, farm, and, manufacture, of, inputs, used, on, the, farm, direct, consumption, includes, the, use, of, lubricants, and, fuels, to, operate, farm, vehicles, and, machinery, indirect, consumption, includes, the, manufacture, of, fertilizers, pesticides, and, farm, machinery, in, particular, the, production, of, nitrogen, fertilizer, can, account, for, over, half, of, agricultural, energy, usage, together, direct, and, indirect, consumption, by, us, farms, accounts, for, about, 2, of, the, nation, s, energy, use, direct, and, indirect, energy, consumption, by, u, s, farms, peaked, in, 1979, and, has, since, gradually, declined, food, systems, encompass, not, just, agriculture, but, off, farm, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and, disposal, of, food, and, food, related, items, agriculture, accounts, for, less, than, one, fifth, of, food, system, energy, use, in, the, us, plastic, products, are, used, extensively, in, agriculture, including, to, increase, crop, yields, and, improve, the, efficiency, of, water, and, agrichemical, use, agriplastic, products, include, films, to, cover, greenhouses, and, tunnels, mulch, to, cover, soil, e, g, to, suppress, weeds, conserve, water, increase, soil, temperature, and, aid, fertilizer, application, shade, cloth, pesticide, containers, seedling, trays, protective, mesh, and, irrigation, tubing, the, polymers, most, commonly, used, in, these, products, are, low, density, polyethylene, lpde, linear, low, density, polyethylene, lldpe, polypropylene, pp, and, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, the, total, amount, of, plastics, used, in, agriculture, is, difficult, to, quantify, a, 2012, study, reported, that, almost, 6, 5, million, tonnes, per, year, were, consumed, globally, while, a, later, study, estimated, that, global, demand, in, 2015, was, between, 7, 3, million, and, 9, million, tonnes, widespread, use, of, plastic, mulch, and, lack, of, systematic, collection, and, management, have, led, to, the, generation, of, large, amounts, of, mulch, residue, weathering, and, degradation, eventually, cause, the, mulch, to, fragment, these, fragments, and, larger, pieces, of, plastic, accumulate, in, soil, mulch, residue, has, been, measured, at, levels, of, 50, to, 260, kg, per, hectare, in, topsoil, in, areas, where, mulch, use, dates, back, more, than, 10, years, which, confirms, that, mulching, is, a, major, source, of, both, microplastic, and, macroplastic, soil, contamination, agricultural, plastics, especially, plastic, films, are, not, easy, to, recycle, because, of, high, contamination, levels, up, to, 40, 50, by, weight, contamination, by, pesticides, fertilizers, soil, and, debris, moist, vegetation, silage, juice, water, and, uv, stabilizers, and, collection, difficulties, therefore, they, are, often, buried, or, abandoned, in, fields, and, watercourses, or, burned, these, disposal, practices, lead, to, soil, degradation, and, can, result, in, contamination, of, soils, and, leakage, of, microplastics, into, the, marine, environment, as, a, result, of, precipitation, run, off, and, tidal, washing, in, addition, additives, in, residual, plastic, film, such, as, uv, and, thermal, stabilizers, may, have, deleterious, effects, on, crop, growth, soil, structure, nutrient, transport, and, salt, levels, there, is, a, risk, that, plastic, mulch, will, deteriorate, soil, quality, deplete, soil, organic, matter, stocks, increase, soil, water, repellence, and, emit, greenhouse, gases, microplastics, released, through, fragmentation, of, agricultural, plastics, can, absorb, and, concentrate, contaminants, capable, of, being, passed, up, the, trophic, chain, agricultural, economics, is, economics, as, it, relates, to, the, production, distribution, and, consumption, of, goods, and, services, combining, agricultural, production, with, general, theories, of, marketing, and, business, as, a, discipline, of, study, began, in, the, late, 1800s, and, grew, significantly, through, the, 20th, century, although, the, study, of, agricultural, economics, is, relatively, recent, major, trends, in, agriculture, have, significantly, affected, national, and, international, economies, throughout, history, ranging, from, tenant, farmers, and, sharecropping, in, the, post, american, civil, war, southern, united, states, to, the, european, feudal, system, of, manorialism, in, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, food, costs, attributed, to, food, processing, distribution, and, agricultural, marketing, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, value, chain, have, risen, while, the, costs, attributed, to, farming, have, declined, this, is, related, to, the, greater, efficiency, of, farming, combined, with, the, increased, level, of, value, addition, e, g, more, highly, processed, products, provided, by, the, supply, chain, market, concentration, has, increased, in, the, sector, as, well, and, although, the, total, effect, of, the, increased, market, concentration, is, likely, increased, efficiency, the, changes, redistribute, economic, surplus, from, producers, farmers, and, consumers, and, may, have, negative, implications, for, rural, communities, national, government, policies, such, as, taxation, subsidies, tariffs, and, others, can, significantly, change, the, economic, marketplace, for, agricultural, products, since, at, least, the, 1960s, a, combination, of, trade, restrictions, exchange, rate, policies, and, subsidies, have, affected, farmers, in, both, the, developing, and, the, developed, world, in, the, 1980s, non, subsidized, farmers, in, developing, countries, experienced, adverse, effects, from, national, policies, that, created, artificially, low, global, prices, for, farm, products, between, the, mid, 1980s, and, the, early, 2000s, several, international, agreements, limited, agricultural, tariffs, subsidies, and, other, trade, restrictions, however, as, of, 2009, there, was, still, a, significant, amount, of, policy, driven, distortion, in, global, agricultural, product, prices, the, three, agricultural, products, with, the, most, trade, distortion, were, sugar, milk, and, rice, mainly, due, to, taxation, among, the, oilseeds, sesame, had, the, most, taxation, but, overall, feed, grains, and, oilseeds, had, much, lower, levels, of, taxation, than, livestock, products, since, the, 1980s, policy, driven, distortions, have, decreases, more, among, livestock, products, than, crops, during, the, worldwide, reforms, in, agricultural, policy, despite, this, progress, certain, crops, such, as, cotton, still, see, subsidies, in, developed, countries, artificially, deflating, global, prices, causing, hardship, in, developing, countries, with, non, subsidized, farmers, unprocessed, commodities, such, as, corn, soybeans, and, cattle, are, generally, graded, to, indicate, quality, affecting, the, price, the, producer, receives, commodities, are, generally, reported, by, production, quantities, such, as, volume, number, or, weight, agricultural, science, is, a, broad, multidisciplinary, field, of, biology, that, encompasses, the, parts, of, exact, natural, economic, and, social, sciences, used, in, the, practice, and, understanding, of, agriculture, it, covers, topics, such, as, agronomy, plant, breeding, and, genetics, plant, pathology, crop, modelling, soil, science, entomology, production, techniques, and, improvement, study, of, pests, and, their, management, and, study, of, adverse, environmental, effects, such, as, soil, degradation, waste, management, and, bioremediation, the, scientific, study, of, agriculture, began, in, the, 18th, century, when, johann, friedrich, mayer, conducted, experiments, on, the, use, of, gypsum, hydrated, calcium, sulphate, as, a, fertilizer, research, became, more, systematic, when, in, 1843, john, lawes, and, henry, gilbert, began, a, set, of, long, term, agronomy, field, experiments, at, rothamsted, research, station, in, england, some, of, them, such, as, the, park, grass, experiment, are, still, running, in, america, the, hatch, act, of, 1887, provided, funding, for, what, it, was, the, first, to, call, agricultural, science, driven, by, farmers, interest, in, fertilizers, in, agricultural, entomology, the, usda, began, to, research, biological, control, in, 1881, it, instituted, its, first, large, program, in, 1905, searching, europe, and, japan, for, natural, enemies, of, the, spongy, moth, and, brown, tail, moth, establishing, parasitoids, such, as, solitary, wasps, and, predators, of, both, pests, in, the, us, agricultural, policy, is, the, set, of, government, decisions, and, actions, relating, to, domestic, agriculture, and, imports, of, foreign, agricultural, products, governments, usually, implement, agricultural, policies, with, the, goal, of, achieving, a, specific, outcome, in, the, domestic, agricultural, product, markets, some, overarching, themes, include, risk, management, and, adjustment, including, policies, related, to, climate, change, food, safety, and, natural, disasters, economic, stability, including, policies, related, to, taxes, natural, resources, and, environmental, sustainability, especially, water, policy, research, and, development, and, market, access, for, domestic, commodities, including, relations, with, global, organizations, and, agreements, with, other, countries, agricultural, policy, can, also, touch, on, food, quality, ensuring, that, the, food, supply, is, of, a, consistent, and, known, quality, food, security, ensuring, that, the, food, supply, meets, the, population, s, needs, and, conservation, policy, programs, can, range, from, financial, programs, such, as, subsidies, to, encouraging, producers, to, enroll, in, voluntary, quality, assurance, programs, a, 2021, report, finds, that, globally, support, to, agricultural, producers, accounts, for, almost, us, 540, billion, a, year, this, amounts, to, 15, percent, of, total, agricultural, production, value, and, is, heavily, biased, towards, measures, that, are, leading, to, inefficiency, as, well, as, are, unequally, distributed, and, harmful, for, the, environment, and, human, health, there, are, many, influences, on, the, creation, of, agricultural,
