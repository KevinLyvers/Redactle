khmer, k, m, r, k, mair, ungegn, khm, r, is, an, austroasiatic, language, spoken, natively, by, the, khmer, people, this, language, is, an, official, language, and, national, language, of, cambodia, the, language, is, also, widely, spoken, by, khmer, people, in, eastern, thailand, and, isan, thailand, also, in, southeast, and, mekong, delta, of, vietnam, khmer, has, been, influenced, considerably, by, sanskrit, and, pali, especially, in, the, royal, and, religious, registers, through, hinduism, and, buddhism, due, to, old, khmer, being, the, language, of, the, historical, empires, of, chenla, angkor, the, vast, majority, of, khmer, speakers, speak, central, khmer, the, dialect, of, the, central, plain, where, the, khmer, are, most, heavily, concentrated, within, cambodia, regional, accents, exist, in, remote, areas, but, these, are, regarded, as, varieties, of, central, khmer, two, exceptions, are, the, speech, of, the, capital, phnom, penh, and, that, of, the, khmer, khe, in, stung, treng, province, both, of, which, differ, sufficiently, enough, from, central, khmer, to, be, considered, separate, dialects, of, khmer, outside, of, cambodia, three, distinct, dialects, are, spoken, by, ethnic, khmers, native, to, areas, that, were, historically, part, of, the, khmer, empire, the, northern, khmer, dialect, is, spoken, by, over, a, million, khmers, in, the, southern, regions, of, northeast, thailand, and, is, treated, by, some, linguists, as, a, separate, language, khmer, krom, or, southern, khmer, is, the, first, language, of, the, khmer, of, vietnam, while, the, khmer, living, in, the, remote, cardamom, mountains, speak, a, very, conservative, dialect, that, still, displays, features, of, the, middle, khmer, language, khmer, is, primarily, an, analytic, isolating, language, there, are, no, inflections, conjugations, or, case, endings, instead, particles, and, auxiliary, words, are, used, to, indicate, grammatical, relationships, general, word, order, is, subject, verb, object, and, modifiers, follow, the, word, they, modify, classifiers, appear, after, numbers, when, used, to, count, nouns, though, not, always, so, consistently, as, in, languages, like, chinese, in, spoken, khmer, topic, comment, structure, is, common, and, the, perceived, social, relation, between, participants, determines, which, sets, of, vocabulary, such, as, pronouns, and, honorifics, are, proper, khmer, differs, from, neighboring, languages, such, as, burmese, thai, lao, and, vietnamese, in, that, it, is, not, a, tonal, language, words, are, stressed, on, the, final, syllable, hence, many, words, conform, to, the, typical, mon, khmer, pattern, of, a, stressed, syllable, preceded, by, a, minor, syllable, the, language, has, been, written, in, the, khmer, script, an, abugida, descended, from, the, brahmi, script, via, the, southern, indian, pallava, script, since, at, least, the, 7th, century, the, script, s, form, and, use, has, evolved, over, the, centuries, its, modern, features, include, subscripted, versions, of, consonants, used, to, write, clusters, and, a, division, of, consonants, into, two, series, with, different, inherent, vowels, khmer, is, a, member, of, the, austroasiatic, language, family, the, autochthonous, family, in, an, area, that, stretches, from, the, malay, peninsula, through, southeast, asia, to, east, india, austroasiatic, which, also, includes, mon, vietnamese, and, munda, has, been, studied, since, 1856, and, was, first, proposed, as, a, language, family, in, 1907, despite, the, amount, of, research, there, is, still, doubt, about, the, internal, relationship, of, the, languages, of, austroasiatic, diffloth, places, khmer, in, an, eastern, branch, of, the, mon, khmer, languages, in, these, classification, schemes, khmer, s, closest, genetic, relatives, are, the, bahnaric, and, pearic, languages, more, recent, classifications, doubt, the, validity, of, the, mon, khmer, sub, grouping, and, place, the, khmer, language, as, its, own, branch, of, austroasiatic, equidistant, from, the, other, 12, branches, of, the, family, khmer, is, spoken, by, some, 13, million, people, in, cambodia, where, it, is, the, official, language, it, is, also, a, second, language, for, most, of, the, minority, groups, and, indigenous, hill, tribes, there, additionally, there, are, a, million, speakers, of, khmer, native, to, southern, vietnam, 1999, census, and, 1, 4, million, in, northeast, thailand, 2006, khmer, dialects, although, mutually, intelligible, are, sometimes, quite, marked, notable, variations, are, found, in, speakers, from, phnom, penh, cambodia, s, capital, city, the, rural, battambang, area, the, areas, of, northeast, thailand, adjacent, to, cambodia, such, as, surin, province, the, cardamom, mountains, and, southern, vietnam, the, dialects, form, a, continuum, running, roughly, north, to, south, standard, cambodian, khmer, is, mutually, intelligible, with, the, others, but, a, khmer, krom, speaker, from, vietnam, for, instance, may, have, great, difficulty, communicating, with, a, khmer, native, of, sisaket, province, in, thailand, the, following, is, a, classification, scheme, showing, the, development, of, the, modern, khmer, dialects, standard, khmer, or, central, khmer, the, language, as, taught, in, cambodian, schools, and, used, by, the, media, is, based, on, the, dialect, spoken, throughout, the, central, plain, a, region, encompassed, by, the, northwest, and, central, provinces, northern, khmer, called, khmer, surin, in, khmer, refers, to, the, dialects, spoken, by, many, in, several, border, provinces, of, present, day, northeast, thailand, after, the, fall, of, the, khmer, empire, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, dongrek, mountains, served, as, a, natural, border, leaving, the, khmer, north, of, the, mountains, under, the, sphere, of, influence, of, the, kingdom, of, lan, xang, the, conquests, of, cambodia, by, naresuan, the, great, for, ayutthaya, furthered, their, political, and, economic, isolation, from, cambodia, proper, leading, to, a, dialect, that, developed, relatively, independently, from, the, midpoint, of, the, middle, khmer, period, this, has, resulted, in, a, distinct, accent, influenced, by, the, surrounding, tonal, languages, lao, and, thai, lexical, differences, and, phonemic, differences, in, both, vowels, and, distribution, of, consonants, syllable, final, r, which, has, become, silent, in, other, dialects, of, khmer, is, still, pronounced, in, northern, khmer, some, linguists, classify, northern, khmer, as, a, separate, but, closely, related, language, rather, than, a, dialect, western, khmer, also, called, cardamom, khmer, or, chanthaburi, khmer, is, spoken, by, a, very, small, isolated, population, in, the, cardamom, mountain, range, extending, from, western, cambodia, into, eastern, central, thailand, although, little, studied, this, variety, is, unique, in, that, it, maintains, a, definite, system, of, vocal, register, that, has, all, but, disappeared, in, other, dialects, of, modern, khmer, phnom, penh, khmer, is, spoken, in, the, capital, and, surrounding, areas, this, dialect, is, characterized, by, merging, or, complete, elision, of, syllables, which, speakers, from, other, regions, consider, a, relaxed, pronunciation, for, instance, phnom, penh, is, sometimes, shortened, to, m, penh, another, characteristic, of, phnom, penh, speech, is, observed, in, words, with, an, r, either, as, an, initial, consonant, or, as, the, second, member, of, a, consonant, cluster, as, in, the, english, word, bread, the, r, trilled, or, flapped, in, other, dialects, is, either, pronounced, as, a, uvular, trill, or, not, pronounced, at, all, this, alters, the, quality, of, any, preceding, consonant, causing, a, harder, more, emphasized, pronunciation, another, unique, result, is, that, the, syllable, is, spoken, with, a, low, rising, or, dipping, tone, much, like, the, h, i, tone, in, vietnamese, for, example, some, people, pronounce, fish, as, the, is, dropped, and, the, vowel, begins, by, dipping, much, lower, in, tone, than, standard, speech, and, then, rises, effectively, doubling, its, length, another, example, is, the, word, study, which, is, pronounced, with, the, uvular, r, and, the, same, intonation, described, above, khmer, krom, or, southern, khmer, is, spoken, by, the, indigenous, khmer, population, of, the, mekong, delta, formerly, controlled, by, the, khmer, empire, but, part, of, vietnam, since, 1698, khmers, are, persecuted, by, the, vietnamese, government, for, using, their, native, language, and, since, the, 1950s, have, been, forced, to, take, vietnamese, names, consequently, very, little, research, has, been, published, regarding, this, dialect, it, has, been, generally, influenced, by, vietnamese, for, three, centuries, and, accordingly, displays, a, pronounced, accent, tendency, toward, monosyllabic, words, and, lexical, differences, from, standard, khmer, khmer, khe, is, spoken, in, the, se, san, srepok, and, sekong, river, valleys, of, sesan, and, siem, pang, districts, in, stung, treng, province, following, the, decline, of, angkor, the, khmer, abandoned, their, northern, territories, which, the, lao, then, settled, in, the, 17th, century, chey, chetha, xi, led, a, khmer, force, into, stung, treng, to, retake, the, area, the, khmer, khe, living, in, this, area, of, stung, treng, in, modern, times, are, presumed, to, be, the, descendants, of, this, group, their, dialect, is, thought, to, resemble, that, of, pre, modern, siem, reap, linguistic, study, of, the, khmer, language, divides, its, history, into, four, periods, one, of, which, the, old, khmer, period, is, subdivided, into, pre, angkorian, and, angkorian, pre, angkorian, khmer, is, the, old, khmer, language, from, 600, ce, through, 800, angkorian, khmer, is, the, language, as, it, was, spoken, in, the, khmer, empire, from, the, 9th, century, until, the, 13th, century, the, following, centuries, saw, changes, in, morphology, phonology, and, lexicon, the, language, of, this, transition, period, from, about, the, 14th, to, 18th, centuries, is, referred, to, as, middle, khmer, and, saw, borrowings, from, thai, in, the, literary, register, modern, khmer, is, dated, from, the, 19th, century, to, today, the, following, table, shows, the, conventionally, accepted, historical, stages, of, khmer, just, as, modern, khmer, was, emerging, from, the, transitional, period, represented, by, middle, khmer, cambodia, fell, under, the, influence, of, french, colonialism, thailand, which, had, for, centuries, claimed, suzerainty, over, cambodia, and, controlled, succession, to, the, cambodian, throne, began, losing, its, influence, on, the, language, in, 1887, cambodia, was, fully, integrated, into, french, indochina, which, brought, in, a, french, speaking, aristocracy, this, led, to, french, becoming, the, language, of, higher, education, and, the, intellectual, class, by, 1907, the, french, had, wrested, over, half, of, modern, day, cambodia, including, the, north, and, northwest, where, thai, had, been, the, prestige, language, back, from, thai, control, and, reintegrated, it, into, the, country, many, native, scholars, in, the, early, 20th, century, led, by, a, monk, named, chuon, nath, resisted, the, french, and, thai, influences, on, their, language, forming, the, government, sponsored, cultural, committee, to, define, and, standardize, the, modern, language, they, championed, khmerization, purging, of, foreign, elements, reviving, affixation, and, the, use, of, old, khmer, roots, and, historical, pali, and, sanskrit, to, coin, new, words, for, modern, ideas, opponents, led, by, keng, vannsak, who, embraced, total, khmerization, by, denouncing, the, reversion, to, classical, languages, and, favoring, the, use, of, contemporary, colloquial, khmer, for, neologisms, and, ieu, koeus, who, favored, borrowing, from, thai, were, also, influential, koeus, later, joined, the, cultural, committee, and, supported, nath, nath, s, views, and, prolific, work, won, out, and, he, is, credited, with, cultivating, modern, khmer, language, identity, and, culture, overseeing, the, translation, of, the, entire, pali, buddhist, canon, into, khmer, he, also, created, the, modern, khmer, language, dictionary, that, is, still, in, use, today, helping, preserve, khmer, during, the, french, colonial, period, the, phonological, system, described, here, is, the, inventory, of, sounds, of, the, standard, spoken, language, represented, using, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, the, voiceless, plosives, p, t, c, k, may, occur, with, or, without, aspiration, as, vs, etc, this, difference, is, contrastive, before, a, vowel, however, the, aspirated, sounds, in, that, position, may, be, analyzed, as, sequences, of, two, phonemes, ph, th, ch, kh, this, analysis, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, infixes, can, be, inserted, between, the, stop, and, the, aspiration, for, example, big, becomes, size, with, a, nominalizing, infix, when, one, of, these, plosives, occurs, initially, before, another, consonant, aspiration, is, no, longer, contrastive, and, can, be, regarded, as, mere, phonetic, detail, slight, aspiration, is, expected, when, the, following, consonant, is, not, one, of, b, d, r, s, h, or, if, the, initial, plosive, is, k, the, voiced, plosives, are, pronounced, as, implosives, by, most, speakers, but, this, feature, is, weak, in, educated, speech, where, they, become, in, syllable, final, position, h, and, approach, and, respectively, the, stops, p, t, c, k, are, unaspirated, and, have, no, audible, release, when, occurring, as, syllable, finals, in, addition, the, consonants, f, and, z, occur, occasionally, in, recent, loan, words, in, the, speech, of, cambodians, familiar, with, french, and, other, languages, various, authors, have, proposed, slightly, different, analyses, of, the, khmer, vowel, system, this, may, be, in, part, because, of, the, wide, degree, of, variation, in, pronunciation, between, individual, speakers, even, within, a, dialectal, region, the, description, below, follows, huffman, 1970, the, number, of, vowel, nuclei, and, their, values, vary, between, dialects, differences, exist, even, between, the, standard, khmer, system, and, that, of, the, battambang, dialect, on, which, the, standard, is, based, in, addition, some, diphthongs, and, triphthongs, are, analyzed, as, a, vowel, nucleus, plus, a, semivowel, j, or, w, coda, because, they, cannot, be, followed, by, a, final, consonant, these, include, with, short, monophthongs, w, w, aj, aw, uj, with, long, monophthongs, j, a, j, with, long, diphthongs, i, j, i, w, j, aoj, a, j, and, u, j, the, independent, vowels, are, the, vowels, that, can, exist, without, a, preceding, or, trailing, consonant, the, independent, vowels, may, be, used, as, monosyllabic, words, or, as, the, initial, syllables, in, longer, words, khmer, words, never, begin, with, regular, vowels, they, can, however, begin, with, independent, vowels, example, a, khmer, syllable, begins, with, a, single, consonant, or, else, with, a, cluster, of, two, or, rarely, three, consonants, the, only, possible, clusters, of, three, consonants, at, the, start, of, a, syllable, are, str, skr, and, with, aspirated, consonants, analyzed, as, two, consonant, sequences, sth, lkh, there, are, 85, possible, two, consonant, clusters, including, etc, analyzed, as, ph, etc, all, the, clusters, are, shown, in, the, following, table, phonetically, i, e, superscript, can, mark, either, contrastive, or, non, contrastive, aspiration, see, above, slight, vowel, epenthesis, occurs, in, the, clusters, consisting, of, a, plosive, followed, by, b, d, in, those, beginning, m, l, and, in, the, cluster, k, 8, 9, after, the, initial, consonant, or, consonant, cluster, comes, the, syllabic, nucleus, which, is, one, of, the, vowels, listed, above, this, vowel, may, end, the, syllable, or, may, be, followed, by, a, coda, which, is, a, single, consonant, if, the, syllable, is, stressed, and, the, vowel, is, short, there, must, be, a, final, consonant, all, consonant, sounds, except, b, d, r, s, and, the, aspirates, can, appear, as, the, coda, although, final, r, is, heard, in, some, dialects, most, notably, in, northern, khmer, a, minor, syllable, unstressed, syllable, preceding, the, main, syllable, of, a, word, has, a, structure, of, cv, crv, cvn, or, crvn, where, c, is, a, consonant, v, a, vowel, and, n, a, nasal, consonant, the, vowels, in, such, syllables, are, usually, short, in, conversation, they, may, be, reduced, to, although, in, careful, or, formal, speech, including, on, television, and, radio, they, are, clearly, articulated, an, example, of, such, a, word, is, m, nuh, m, n, h, m, nuh, person, pronounced, or, more, casually, 10, stress, in, khmer, falls, on, the, final, syllable, of, a, word, because, of, this, predictable, pattern, stress, is, non, phonemic, in, khmer, it, does, not, distinguish, different, meanings, most, khmer, words, consist, of, either, one, or, two, syllables, in, most, native, disyllabic, words, the, first, syllable, is, a, minor, fully, unstressed, syllable, such, words, have, been, described, as, sesquisyllabic, i, e, as, having, one, and, a, half, syllables, there, are, also, some, disyllabic, words, in, which, the, first, syllable, does, not, behave, as, a, minor, syllable, but, takes, secondary, stress, most, such, words, are, compounds, but, some, are, single, morphemes, generally, loanwords, an, example, is, language, pronounced, 10, words, with, three, or, more, syllables, if, they, are, not, compounds, are, mostly, loanwords, usually, derived, from, pali, sanskrit, or, more, recently, french, they, are, nonetheless, adapted, to, khmer, stress, patterns, primary, stress, falls, on, the, final, syllable, with, secondary, stress, on, every, second, syllable, from, the, end, thus, in, a, three, syllable, word, the, first, syllable, has, secondary, stress, in, a, four, syllable, word, the, second, syllable, has, secondary, stress, in, a, five, syllable, word, the, first, and, third, syllables, have, secondary, stress, and, so, on, 10, 11, long, polysyllables, are, not, often, used, in, conversation, 12, compounds, however, preserve, the, stress, patterns, of, the, constituent, words, thus, the, name, of, a, kind, of, cookie, literally, bird, s, nest, is, pronounced, with, secondary, stress, on, the, second, rather, than, the, first, syllable, because, it, is, composed, of, the, words, nest, and, bird, khmer, once, had, a, phonation, distinction, in, its, vowels, but, this, now, survives, only, in, the, most, archaic, dialect, western, khmer, the, distinction, arose, historically, when, vowels, after, old, khmer, voiced, consonants, became, breathy, voiced, and, diphthongized, for, example, kaa, aa, became, kaa, e, a, when, consonant, voicing, was, lost, the, distinction, was, maintained, by, the, vowel, kaa, ke, a, later, the, phonation, disappeared, as, well, these, processes, explain, the, origin, of, what, are, now, called, a, series, and, o, series, consonants, in, the, khmer, script, although, most, cambodian, dialects, are, not, tonal, the, colloquial, phnom, penh, dialect, has, developed, a, tonal, contrast, level, versus, peaking, tone, as, a, by, product, of, the, elision, of, r, intonation, often, conveys, semantic, context, in, khmer, as, in, distinguishing, declarative, statements, questions, and, exclamations, the, available, grammatical, means, of, making, such, distinctions, are, not, always, used, or, may, be, ambiguous, for, example, the, final, interrogative, particle, te, can, also, serve, as, an, emphasizing, or, in, some, cases, negating, particle, the, intonation, pattern, of, a, typical, khmer, declarative, phrase, is, a, steady, rise, throughout, followed, by, an, abrupt, drop, on, the, last, syllable, other, intonation, contours, signify, a, different, type, of, phrase, such, as, the, full, doubt, interrogative, similar, to, yes, no, questions, in, english, full, doubt, interrogatives, remain, fairly, even, in, tone, throughout, but, rise, sharply, towards, the, end, exclamatory, phrases, follow, the, typical, steadily, rising, pattern, but, rise, sharply, on, the, last, syllable, instead, of, falling, khmer, is, primarily, an, analytic, language, with, no, inflection, syntactic, relations, are, mainly, determined, by, word, order, old, and, middle, khmer, used, particles, to, mark, grammatical, categories, and, many, of, these, have, survived, in, modern, khmer, but, are, used, sparingly, mostly, in, literary, or, formal, language, khmer, makes, extensive, use, of, auxiliary, verbs, directionals, and, serial, verb, construction, colloquial, khmer, is, a, zero, copula, language, instead, preferring, predicative, adjectives, and, even, predicative, nouns, unless, using, a, copula, for, emphasis, or, to, avoid, ambiguity, in, more, complex, sentences, basic, word, order, is, subject, verb, object, svo, although, subjects, are, often, dropped, prepositions, are, used, rather, than, postpositions, topic, comment, constructions, are, common, and, the, language, is, generally, head, initial, modifiers, follow, the, words, they, modify, some, grammatical, processes, are, still, not, fully, understood, by, western, scholars, for, example, it, is, not, clear, if, certain, features, of, khmer, grammar, such, as, actor, nominalization, should, be, treated, as, a, morphological, process, or, a, purely, syntactic, device, 46, 74, and, some, derivational, morphology, seems, purely, decorative, and, performs, no, known, syntactic, work, 53, lexical, categories, have, been, hard, to, define, in, khmer, 360, henri, maspero, an, early, scholar, of, khmer, claimed, the, language, had, no, parts, of, speech, while, a, later, scholar, judith, jacob, posited, four, parts, of, speech, and, innumerable, particles, 331, john, haiman, on, the, other, hand, identifies, a, couple, dozen, parts, of, speech, in, khmer, with, the, caveat, that, khmer, words, have, the, freedom, to, perform, a, variety, of, syntactic, functions, depending, on, such, factors, as, word, order, relevant, particles, location, within, a, clause, intonation, and, context, some, of, the, more, important, lexical, categories, and, their, function, are, demonstrated, in, the, following, example, sentence, taken, from, a, hospital, brochure, 378, lo, k, you, pn, n, you, pn, p, l, provide, verb, c, i, m, blood,

derivation, by, means, of, prefixes, and, infixes, but, this, is, a, remnant, of, old, khmer, and, not, always, productive, in, the, modern, language, khmer, morphology, is, evidence, of, a, historical, process, through, which, the, language, was, at, some, point, in, the, past, changed, from, being, an, agglutinative, language, to, adopting, an, isolating, typology, affixed, forms, are, lexicalized, and, cannot, be, used, productively, to, form, new, words, 311, below, are, some, of, the, most, common, affixes, with, examples, as, given, by, huffman, 312, 316, compounding, in, khmer, is, a, common, derivational, process, that, takes, two, forms, coordinate, compounds, and, repetitive, compounds, coordinate, compounds, join, two, unbound, morphemes, independent, words, of, similar, meaning, to, form, a, compound, signifying, a, concept, more, general, than, either, word, alone, 296, coordinate, compounds, join, either, two, nouns, or, two, verbs, repetitive, compounds, one, of, the, most, productive, derivational, features, of, khmer, use, reduplication, of, an, entire, word, to, derive, words, whose, meaning, depends, on, the, class, of, the, reduplicated, word, 185, a, repetitive, compound, of, a, noun, indicates, plurality, or, generality, while, that, of, an, adjectival, verb, could, mean, either, an, intensification, or, plurality, coordinate, compounds, 296,

shifted, to, the, phonation, of, the, attached, vowels, which, in, turn, evolved, into, a, simple, difference, of, vowel, quality, often, by, diphthongization, this, process, has, resulted, in, the, khmer, alphabet, having, two, symbols, for, most, consonant, phonemes, and, each, vowel, symbol, having, two, possible, readings, depending, on, the, series, of, the, initial, consonant, the,
