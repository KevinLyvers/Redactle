neuroticism, is, a, personality, trait, associated, with, negative, emotions, it, is, one, of, the, big, five, traits, individuals, with, high, scores, on, neuroticism, are, more, likely, than, average, to, experience, such, feelings, as, anxiety, worry, fear, anger, frustration, envy, jealousy, pessimism, guilt, depressed, mood, and, loneliness, such, people, are, thought, to, respond, worse, to, stressors, and, are, more, likely, to, interpret, ordinary, situations, such, as, minor, frustrations, as, appearing, hopelessly, difficult, their, behavioral, responses, may, include, procrastination, substance, use, and, other, maladaptive, behaviors, which, may, temporarily, aid, in, relieving, negative, emotions, and, generating, positive, ones, people, with, high, scores, on, the, neuroticism, index, are, thought, to, be, at, risk, of, developing, common, mental, disorders, mood, disorders, anxiety, disorders, and, substance, use, disorders, have, been, studied, and, the, sorts, of, symptoms, once, referred, to, as, neuroses, individuals, who, score, low, in, neuroticism, tend, to, be, more, emotionally, stable, and, less, reactive, to, stress, they, tend, to, be, calm, even, tempered, and, less, likely, to, feel, tense, or, rattled, although, they, are, low, in, negative, emotion, they, are, not, necessarily, high, in, positive, emotion, according, to, a, 1998, study, being, high, in, scores, of, positive, emotion, is, generally, an, element, of, the, independent, traits, of, extraversion, and, agreeableness, neurotic, extraverts, for, example, would, experience, high, levels, of, both, positive, and, negative, emotional, states, a, kind, of, emotional, roller, coaster, neuroticism, is, a, trait, in, many, models, within, personality, theory, but, there, is, some, disagreement, on, its, definition, it, is, sometimes, defined, as, a, tendency, for, quick, arousal, when, stimulated, and, slow, relaxation, from, arousal, especially, with, regard, to, negative, emotional, arousal, this, definition, also, fit, people, described, as, highly, sensitive, by, psychologist, elaine, aron, who, sees, high, sensitivity, as, a, misunderstood, trait, that, was, useful, in, human, evolution, another, definition, focuses, on, emotional, instability, and, negativity, or, maladjustment, in, contrast, to, emotional, stability, and, positivity, or, good, adjustment, it, has, also, been, defined, in, terms, of, lack, of, self, control, and, poor, ability, to, manage, psychological, stress, various, personality, tests, produce, numerical, scores, and, these, scores, are, mapped, onto, the, concept, of, neuroticism, in, various, ways, which, has, created, some, confusion, in, the, scientific, literature, especially, with, regard, to, sub, traits, or, facets, like, other, personality, traits, neuroticism, is, typically, viewed, as, a, continuous, dimension, rather, than, a, discrete, state, the, extent, of, neuroticism, is, generally, assessed, using, self, report, measures, although, peer, reports, and, third, party, observation, can, also, be, used, self, report, measures, are, either, lexical, or, based, on, statements, deciding, which, measure, of, either, type, to, use, in, research, is, determined, by, an, assessment, of, psychometric, properties, and, the, time, and, space, constraints, of, the, study, being, undertaken, lexical, measures, use, individual, adjectives, that, reflect, neurotic, traits, such, as, anxiety, envy, jealousy, and, moodiness, and, are, very, space, and, time, efficient, for, research, purposes, lewis, goldberg, 1992, developed, a, 20, word, measure, as, part, of, his, 100, word, big, five, markers, saucier, 1994, developed, a, briefer, 8, word, measure, as, part, of, his, 40, word, mini, markers, thompson, 2008, systematically, revised, these, measures, to, develop, the, international, english, mini, markers, which, has, superior, validity, and, reliability, in, populations, both, within, and, outside, north, america, internal, consistency, reliability, of, the, international, english, mini, markers, for, the, neuroticism, emotional, stability, measure, for, native, english, speakers, is, reported, as, 0, 84, and, that, for, non, native, english, speakers, is, 0, 77, statement, measures, tend, to, comprise, more, words, and, hence, consume, more, research, instrument, space, than, lexical, measures, respondents, are, asked, the, extent, to, which, they, for, example, remain, calm, under, pressure, or, have, frequent, mood, swings, while, some, statement, based, measures, of, neuroticism, have, similarly, acceptable, psychometric, properties, in, north, american, populations, to, lexical, measures, their, generally, emic, development, makes, them, less, suited, to, use, in, other, populations, for, instance, statements, in, colloquial, north, american, english, like, feeling, blue, or, being, down, in, the, dumps, are, sometimes, hard, for, non, native, english, speakers, to, understand, neuroticism, has, also, been, studied, from, the, perspective, of, gray, s, biopsychological, theory, of, personality, using, a, scale, that, measures, personality, along, two, dimensions, the, behavioural, inhibition, system, bis, and, the, behavioural, activation, system, bas, the, bis, is, thought, to, be, related, to, sensitivity, to, punishment, as, well, as, avoidance, motivation, while, the, bas, is, thought, to, be, related, to, sensitivity, to, reward, as, well, as, approach, motivation, neuroticism, has, been, found, to, be, positively, correlated, with, the, bis, scale, and, negatively, correlated, with, the, bas, scale, neuroticism, has, been, included, as, one, of, the, four, dimensions, that, comprise, core, self, evaluations, one, s, fundamental, appraisal, of, oneself, along, with, locus, of, control, self, efficacy, and, self, esteem, the, concept, of, core, self, evaluations, was, first, examined, by, judge, locke, and, durham, 1997, and, since, then, evidence, has, been, found, to, suggest, these, have, the, ability, to, predict, several, work, outcomes, specifically, job, satisfaction, and, job, performance, there, is, a, risk, of, selection, bias, in, surveys, of, neuroticism, a, 2012, review, of, n, scores, said, that, many, studies, used, samples, drawn, from, privileged, and, educated, populations, neuroticism, is, highly, correlated, with, the, startle, reflex, in, response, to, fearful, conditions, and, inversely, correlated, with, it, in, response, to, disgusting, or, repulsive, stimuli, this, suggests, that, neuroticism, may, increase, vigilance, where, evasive, action, is, possible, but, promote, emotional, blunting, when, escape, is, not, an, option, a, measure, of, the, startle, reflex, can, be, used, to, predict, the, trait, neuroticism, with, good, accuracy, a, fact, that, is, thought, by, some, to, underlie, the, neurological, basis, of, the, trait, the, startle, reflex, is, a, reflex, in, response, to, a, loud, noise, that, one, typically, has, no, control, over, though, anticipation, can, reduce, the, effect, the, strength, of, the, reflex, as, well, as, the, time, until, the, reflex, ceases, can, be, used, to, predict, both, neuroticism, and, extraversion, questions, used, in, many, neuroticism, scales, overlap, with, instruments, used, to, assess, mental, disorders, like, anxiety, disorders, especially, social, anxiety, disorder, and, mood, disorders, especially, major, depressive, disorder, which, can, sometimes, confound, efforts, to, interpret, n, scores, and, makes, it, difficult, to, determine, whether, each, of, neuroticism, and, the, overlapping, mental, disorders, might, cause, the, other, or, if, both, might, stem, from, other, causes, correlations, can, be, identified, a, 2013, meta, analysis, found, that, a, wide, range, of, clinical, mental, disorders, are, associated, with, elevated, levels, of, neuroticism, compared, to, levels, in, the, general, population, it, found, that, high, neuroticism, is, predictive, for, the, development, of, anxiety, disorders, major, depressive, disorder, psychosis, and, schizophrenia, and, is, predictive, but, less, so, for, substance, use, and, non, specific, mental, distress, these, associations, are, smaller, after, adjustment, for, elevated, baseline, symptoms, of, the, mental, illnesses, and, psychiatric, history, neuroticism, has, also, been, found, to, be, associated, with, older, age, in, 2007, mroczek, spiro, found, that, among, older, men, upward, trends, in, neuroticism, over, life, as, well, as, increased, neuroticism, overall, both, contributed, to, higher, mortality, rates, disorders, associated, with, elevated, neuroticism, include, mood, disorders, such, as, depression, and, bipolar, disorder, anxiety, disorders, eating, disorders, schizophrenia, and, schizoaffective, disorder, dissociative, identity, disorder, and, hypochondriasis, mood, disorders, tend, to, have, a, much, larger, association, with, neuroticism, than, most, other, disorders, the, five, big, studies, have, described, children, and, adolescents, with, high, neuroticism, as, anxious, vulnerable, tense, easily, frightened, falling, apart, under, stress, guilt, prone, moody, low, in, frustration, tolerance, and, insecure, in, relationships, with, others, which, includes, both, traits, concerning, the, prevalence, of, negative, emotions, as, well, as, the, response, to, these, negative, emotions, neuroticism, in, adults, similarly, was, found, to, be, associated, with, the, frequency, of, self, reported, problems, these, associations, can, vary, with, culture, for, example, adams, found, that, among, upper, middle, class, american, teenaged, girls, neuroticism, was, associated, with, eating, disorders, and, self, harm, but, among, ghanaian, teenaged, girls, higher, neuroticism, was, associated, with, magical, thinking, and, extreme, fear, of, enemies, a, 2004, meta, analysis, attempted, to, analyze, personality, disorders, in, light, of, the, five, factor, personality, theory, and, found, that, elevated, neuroticism, is, correlated, with, many, personality, disorders, studies, have, found, that, the, mean, reaction, times, will, not, differ, between, individuals, high, in, neuroticism, and, those, low, in, neuroticism, but, that, with, individuals, high, in, neuroticism, there, is, considerably, more, trial, to, trial, variability, in, performance, reflected, in, reaction, time, standard, deviations, in, other, words, on, some, trials, neurotic, individuals, are, faster, than, average, and, on, others, they, are, slower, than, average, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, variability, reflects, noise, in, the, individual, s, information, processing, systems, or, instability, of, basic, cognitive, operations, such, as, regulation, processes, and, further, that, this, noise, originates, from, two, sources, mental, preoccupations, and, reactivity, processes, flehmig, et, al, 2007, studied, mental, noise, in, terms, of, everyday, behaviours, using, the, cognitive, failures, questionnaire, which, is, a, self, report, measure, of, the, frequency, of, slips, and, lapses, of, attention, a, slip, is, an, error, by, commission, and, a, lapse, is, an, error, by, omission, this, scale, was, correlated, with, two, well, known, measures, of, neuroticism, the, bis, bas, scale, and, the, eysenck, personality, questionnaire, results, indicated, that, the, cfq, ua, cognitive, failures, questionnaire, unintended, activation, subscale, was, most, strongly, correlated, with, neuroticism, r, 40, and, explained, the, most, variance, 16, compared, to, overall, cfq, scores, which, only, explained, 7, the, authors, interpret, these, findings, as, suggesting, that, mental, noise, is, highly, specific, in, nature, as, it, is, related, most, strongly, to, attention, slips, triggered, endogenously, by, associative, memory, in, other, words, this, may, suggest, that, mental, noise, is, mostly, task, irrelevant, cognitions, such, as, worries, and, preoccupations, the, theory, of, evolution, may, also, explain, differences, in, personality, for, example, one, of, the, evolutionary, approaches, to, depression, focuses, on, neuroticism, and, finds, that, heightened, reactivity, to, negative, outcomes, may, have, had, a, survival, benefit, and, that, furthermore, a, positive, relationship, has, been, found, between, neuroticism, level, and, success, in, university, with, the, precondition, that, the, negative, effects, of, neuroticism, are, also, successfully, coped, with, likewise, a, heightened, reactivity, to, positive, events, may, have, had, reproductive, advantages, selecting, for, heightened, reactivity, generally, nettle, contends, that, evolution, selected, for, higher, levels, of, neuroticism, until, the, negative, effects, of, neuroticism, outweighed, its, benefits, resulting, in, selection, for, a, certain, optimal, level, of, neuroticism, this, type, of, selection, will, result, in, a, normal, distribution, of, neuroticism, so, the, extremities, of, the, distribution, will, be, individuals, with, excessive, neuroticism, or, too, low, neuroticism, for, what, is, optimal, and, the, ones, with, excessive, neuroticism, would, therefore, be, more, vulnerable, to, the, negative, effects, of, depression, and, nettle, gives, this, as, the, explanation, for, the, existence, of, depression, rather, than, hypothesizing, as, others, have, that, depression, itself, has, any, evolutionary, benefit, according, to, terror, management, theory, tmt, neuroticism, is, primarily, caused, by, insufficient, anxiety, buffers, against, unconscious, death, anxiety, these, buffers, consist, of, while, tmt, agrees, with, standard, evolutionary, psychology, accounts, that, the, roots, of, neuroticism, in, homo, sapiens, or, its, ancestors, are, likely, in, adaptive, sensitivities, to, negative, outcomes, it, posits, that, once, homo, sapiens, achieved, a, higher, level, of, self, awareness, neuroticism, increased, enormously, becoming, largely, a, spandrel, a, non, adaptive, byproduct, of, our, adaptive, intelligence, which, resulted, in, a, crippling, awareness, of, death, that, threatened, to, undermine, other, adaptive, functions, this, overblown, anxiety, thus, needed, to, be, buffered, via, intelligently, creative, but, largely, fictitious, and, arbitrary, notions, of, cultural, meaning, and, personal, value, since, highly, religious, or, supernatural, conceptions, of, the, world, provide, cosmic, personal, significance, and, literal, immortality, they, are, deemed, to, offer, the, most, efficient, buffers, against, death, anxiety, and, neuroticism, thus, historically, the, shift, to, more, materialistic, and, secular, cultures, starting, in, the, neolithic, and, culminating, in, the, industrial, revolution, is, deemed, to, have, increased, neuroticism, a, 2013, review, found, that, neuroticism, is, the, product, of, the, interplay, between, genetic, and, environmental, influences, heritability, estimates, typically, range, from, 40, to, 60, the, effect, size, of, these, genetic, differences, remain, largely, the, same, throughout, development, but, the, hunt, for, any, specific, genes, that, control, neuroticism, levels, has, turned, out, to, be, difficult, and, hardly, successful, so, far, on, the, other, hand, with, regards, to, environmental, influences, adversities, during, development, such, as, emotional, neglect, and, sexual, abuse, were, found, to, be, positively, associated, with, neuroticism, however, sustained, change, in, neuroticism, and, mental, health, are, rather, rare, or, have, only, small, effects, in, the, july, 1951, article, the, inheritance, of, neuroticism, by, hans, j, eysenck, and, donald, prell, it, was, reported, that, some, 80, per, cent, of, individual, differences, in, neuroticism, are, due, to, heredity, and, only, 20, percent, are, due, to, environment, the, factor, of, neuroticism, is, not, a, statistical, artifact, but, constitutes, a, biological, unit, which, is, inherited, as, a, whole, neurotic, predisposition, is, to, a, large, extent, hereditarily, determined, in, children, and, adolescents, psychologists, speak, of, temperamental, negative, affectivity, that, during, adolescence, develops, into, the, neuroticism, personality, domain, mean, neuroticism, levels, change, throughout, the, lifespan, as, a, function, of, personality, maturation, and, social, roles, but, also, the, expression, of, new, genes, neuroticism, in, particular, was, found, to, decrease, as, a, result, of, maturity, by, decreasing, through, age, 40, and, then, leveling, off, generally, speaking, the, influence, of, environments, on, neuroticism, increases, over, the, lifespan, although, people, probably, select, and, evoke, experiences, based, on, their, neuroticism, levels, the, emergent, field, of, imaging, genetics, which, investigates, the, role, of, genetic, variation, in, the, structure, and, function, of, the, brain, has, studied, certain, genes, suggested, to, be, related, to, neuroticism, and, the, one, studied, so, far, concerning, this, topic, has, been, the, serotonin, transporter, linked, promoter, region, gene, known, as, 5, httlpr, which, is, transcribed, into, a, serotonin, transporter, that, removes, serotonin, it, has, been, found, that, compared, to, the, long, l, variant, of, 5, httlpr, the, short, s, variant, has, reduced, promoter, activity, and, the, first, study, on, this, subject, has, shown, that, the, presence, of, the, s, variant, 5, httlpr, has, been, found, to, result, in, higher, amygdala, activity, from, seeing, angry, or, fearful, faces, while, doing, a, non, emotional, task, with, further, studies, confirming, that, the, s, variant, 5, httlpr, result, greater, amygdala, activity, in, response, to, negative, stimuli, but, there, have, also, been, null, findings, a, meta, analysis, of, 14, studies, has, shown, that, this, gene, has, a, moderate, effect, size, and, accounts, for, 10, of, the, phenotypic, difference, however, the, relationship, between, brain, activity, and, genetics, may, not, be, completely, straightforward, due, to, other, factors, with, suggestions, made, that, cognitive, control, and, stress, may, moderate, the, effect, of, the, gene, there, are, two, models, that, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, type, of, association, between, the, 5, httlpr, gene, and, amygdala, activity, the, phasic, activation, model, proposes, that, the, gene, controls, amygdala, activity, levels, in, response, to, stress, whereas, the, tonic, activation, model, on, the, other, hand, proposes, that, the, gene, controls, baseline, amygdala, activity, another, gene, that, has, been, suggested, for, further, study, to, be, related, to, neuroticism, is, the, catechol, o, methyltransferase, comt, gene, the, anxiety, and, maladaptive, stress, responses, that, are, aspects, of, neuroticism, have, been, the, subject, of, intensive, study, dysregulation, of, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, and, glucocorticoid, system, and, influence, of, different, versions, of, the, serotonin, transporter, and, 5, ht1a, receptor, genes, may, influence, the, development, of, neuroticism, in, combination, with, environmental, effects, like, the, quality, of, upbringing, neuroimaging, studies, with, fmri, have, had, mixed, results, with, some, finding, that, increased, activity, in, the, amygdala, and, anterior, cingulate, cortex, brain, regions, associated, with, arousal, is, correlated, with, high, neuroticism, scores, as, is, activation, of, the, associations, have, also, been, found, with, the, medial, prefrontal, cortex, insular, cortex, and, hippocampus, while, other, studies, have, found, no, correlations, further, studies, have, been, conducted, trying, to, tighten, experimental, design, by, using, genetics, to, add, additional, differentiation, among, participants, as, well, as, twin, study, models, a, related, trait, behavioral, inhibition, or, inhibition, to, the, unfamiliar, has, received, attention, as, the, trait, concerning, withdrawal, or, fear, from, unfamiliar, situations, which, is, generally, measured, through, observation, of, child, behavior, in, response, to, for, example, encountering, unfamiliar, individuals, this, trait, in, particular, has, been, hypothesized, to, be, related, to, amygdala, function, but, the, evidence, so, far, has, been, mixed, a, research, over, large, samples, has, shown, that, levels, of, neuroticism, are, higher, in, women, than, men, neuroticism, is, also, found, to, decrease, slightly, with, age, the, same, study, noted, that, no, functional, mri, studies, have, yet, been, performed, to, investigate, these, differences, calling, for, more, research, a, 2010, review, found, personality, differences, between, genders, to, be, between, small, and, moderate, the, largest, of, those, differences, being, in, the, traits, of, agreeableness, and, neuroticism, many, personality, traits, were, found, to, have, had, larger, personality, differences, between, men, and, women, in, developed, countries, compared, to, less, developed, countries, and, differences, in, three, traits, extraversion, neuroticism, and, people, versus, thing, orientation, showed, differences, that, remained, consistent, across, different, levels, of, economic, development, which, is, also, consistent, with, the, possible, influence, of, biologic, factors, three, cross, cultural, studies, have, revealed, higher, levels, of, female, neuroticism, across, almost, all, nations, a, 2016, review, investigated, the, geographic, issue, it, found, that, in, us, neuroticism, is, highest, in, the, mid, atlantic, states, and, southwards, but, declines, westward, while, openness, to, experience, is, highest, in, ethnically, diverse, regions, of, the, mid, atlantic, new, england, the, west, coast, and, cities, likewise, in, the, uk, neuroticism, is, lowest, in, urban, areas, generally, geographical, studies, find, correlations, between, low, neuroticism, and, entrepreneurship, and, economic, vitality, and, correlations, between, high, neuroticism, and, poor, health, outcomes, the, review, found, that, the, causal, relationship, between, regional, cultural, and, economic, conditions, and, psychological, health, is, unclear, a, 2013, review, found, that, a, high, level, of, neuroticism, in, young, adults, is, a, risk, factor, for, triggering, mood, disorders, neuroticism, is, also, a, possible, risk, factor, for, developing, an, addiction, disorder, to, internet, investigation, of, the, instagram, users, showed, the, preference, of, cosmetic, products, and, intolerance, of, weapons, among, highly, neurotic, users, there, is, a, strong, correlation, between, bruxism, and, neuroticism, more, severe, bruxism, is, associated, with, a, higher, degree, of, neuroticism, when, neuroticism, is, described, as, a, personality, trait, that, measures, emotional, stability, research, has, indicated, that, it, is, also, involved, in, maladaptive, behaviors, to, regulate, an, individual, s, emotions, high, levels, of, neuroticism, in, an, individual, is, associated, with, anxiety, and, overthinking, as, well, as, irritability, and, impulsiveness, studies, have, shown, that, individuals, with, higher, levels, of, neuroticism, are, associated, with, a, shortened, life, span, a, greater, likelihood, of, divorce, and, a, lack, of, education, to, cope, with, the, negative, emotionality, these, individuals, may, engage, in, maladaptive, forms, of, coping, such, as, procrastination, substance, abuse, etc, with, these, internal, pressures, due, to, these, negative, emotions, neuroticism, often, relates, to, difficulties, with, emotion, regulation, leading, to, engagement, in, divergent, risky, behaviors, due, to, the, facets, associated, with, neuroticism, it, can, be, viewed, as, a, negative, personality, trait, a, common, perception, of, the, personality, trait, most, closely, associated, with, risky, behaviors, is, extraversion, due, to, the, correlated, adjectives, such, as, adventurous, enthusiastic, and, outgoing, these, adjectives, allow, the, individual, to, feel, the, positive, emotions, associated, with, risk, taking, however, neuroticism, can, also, be, a, contributing, factor, just, for, different, reasons, as, anxiety, is, one, of, the, facets, of, neuroticism, it, can, lead, to, indulgence, in, anxiety, based, maladaptive, and, risky, behaviors, neuroticism, is, considerably, stable, over, time, and, research, has, shown, that, individuals, with, higher, levels, of, neuroticism, may, prefer, short, term, solutions, such, as, risky, behaviors, and, neglect, the, long, term, costs, this, is, relevant, to, neuroticism, because, it, is, also, associated, with, impulsivity, one, of, the, distinct, traits, of, impulsivity, is, called, urgency, which, is, a, predisposition, to, experiencing, strong, impulses, that, can, lead, to, impulsive, behavior, while, dealing, with, the, negative, emotions, attached, urgency, can, be, both, negative, and, positive, positive, urgency, deals, with, positive, emotions, and, the, contrast, for, negative, urgency, despite, the, negative, emotions, that, are, prominent, in, neuroticism, research, indicates, that, it, is, combination, of, the, negative, emotions, present, together, with, the, positive, emotions, that, are, generated, by, the, engagement, in, maladaptive, behaviors
