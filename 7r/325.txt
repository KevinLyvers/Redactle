a, phoneme, f, o, n, i, m, is, any, set, of, similar, speech, sounds, that, is, perceptually, regarded, by, the, speakers, of, a, language, as, a, single, distinct, unit, a, single, basic, sound, that, helps, distinguish, one, word, from, another, to, put, it, in, another, way, it, is, the, smallest, unit, of, phonetic, difference, that, distinguishes, meaning, phonemes, are, primarily, associated, with, the, branch, of, linguistics, known, as, phonology, the, english, words, cell, and, set, have, the, exact, same, sequence, of, sounds, except, for, being, different, in, their, final, consonant, sounds, s, l, versus, s, t, in, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, a, writing, system, that, can, be, used, to, represent, phonemes, thus, l, and, t, are, each, examples, of, phonemes, of, the, english, language, since, they, alone, distinguish, certain, words, from, other, words, specifically, they, are, consonant, phonemes, along, with, s, while, is, a, vowel, phoneme, the, spelling, of, english, does, not, strictly, conform, to, its, phonemes, so, that, the, words, knot, nut, and, gnat, regardless, of, spelling, all, share, the, consonant, phonemes, n, and, t, differing, only, by, their, internal, vowel, phonemes, and, respectively, similarly, p, t, is, the, notation, for, a, sequence, of, four, phonemes, p, and, t, that, together, constitute, the, word, pushed, sounds, that, are, perceived, as, phonemes, vary, by, languages, and, dialects, so, that, and, are, separate, phonemes, in, english, since, they, distinguish, words, like, sin, from, sing, s, n, versus, s, yet, they, comprise, a, single, phoneme, in, some, other, languages, such, as, spanish, in, which, and, for, instance, are, merely, interpreted, by, spanish, speakers, as, regional, or, dialect, specific, ways, of, pronouncing, the, same, word, pan, the, spanish, word, for, bread, such, spoken, variations, of, a, single, phoneme, are, known, by, linguists, as, allophones, linguists, use, slashes, in, the, ipa, to, transcribe, phonemes, but, square, brackets, to, transcribe, more, precise, pronunciation, details, including, allophones, they, describe, this, basic, distinction, as, phonemic, versus, phonetic, thus, the, pronunciation, patterns, of, tap, versus, tab, or, pat, versus, bat, can, be, represented, phonemically, and, are, written, between, slashes, including, p, b, etc, while, nuances, of, exactly, how, a, speaker, pronounces, p, are, phonetic, and, written, between, brackets, like, for, the, p, in, spit, versus, for, the, p, in, pit, which, in, english, is, an, aspirated, allophone, of, p, i, e, pronounced, with, an, extra, burst, of, air, there, are, many, views, as, to, exactly, what, phonemes, are, and, how, a, given, language, should, be, analyzed, in, phonemic, terms, generally, a, phoneme, is, regarded, as, an, abstraction, of, a, set, or, equivalence, class, of, spoken, sound, variations, that, are, nevertheless, perceived, as, a, single, basic, unit, of, sound, by, the, ordinary, native, speakers, of, a, given, language, while, phonemes, are, considered, an, abstract, underlying, representation, for, sound, segments, within, words, the, corresponding, phonetic, realizations, of, those, phonemes, each, phoneme, with, its, various, allophones, constitute, the, surface, form, that, is, actually, uttered, and, heard, allophones, each, have, technically, different, articulations, inside, particular, words, or, particular, environments, within, words, yet, these, differences, do, not, create, any, meaningful, distinctions, alternatively, at, least, one, of, those, articulations, could, be, feasibly, used, in, all, such, words, with, these, words, still, being, recognized, as, such, by, users, of, the, language, an, example, in, american, english, is, that, the, sound, spelled, with, the, symbol, t, is, usually, articulated, with, a, glottal, stop, or, a, similar, glottalized, sound, in, the, word, cat, an, alveolar, flap, in, dating, an, alveolar, plosive, in, stick, and, an, aspirated, alveolar, plosive, in, tie, however, american, speakers, perceive, or, hear, all, of, these, sounds, usually, with, no, conscious, effort, as, merely, being, allophones, of, a, single, phoneme, the, one, traditionally, represented, in, the, ipa, as, t, for, computer, typing, purposes, systems, such, as, x, sampa, exist, to, represent, ipa, symbols, using, only, ascii, characters, however, descriptions, of, particular, languages, may, use, different, conventional, symbols, to, represent, the, phonemes, of, those, languages, for, languages, whose, writing, systems, employ, the, phonemic, principle, ordinary, letters, may, be, used, to, denote, phonemes, although, this, approach, is, often, imperfect, as, pronunciations, naturally, shift, in, a, language, over, time, rendering, previous, spelling, systems, outdated, or, no, longer, closely, representative, of, the, sounds, of, the, language, see, correspondence, between, letters, and, phonemes, below, a, phoneme, is, a, sound, or, a, group, of, different, sounds, perceived, to, have, the, same, function, by, speakers, of, the, language, or, dialect, in, question, an, example, is, the, english, phoneme, k, which, occurs, in, words, such, as, c, at, k, it, s, c, at, s, k, it, although, most, native, speakers, do, not, notice, this, in, most, english, dialects, the, c, k, sounds, in, these, words, are, not, identical, in, kit, the, sound, is, aspirated, but, in, skill, it, is, unaspirated, the, words, therefore, contain, different, speech, sounds, or, phones, transcribed, for, the, aspirated, form, and, for, the, unaspirated, one, these, different, sounds, are, nonetheless, considered, to, belong, to, the, same, phoneme, because, if, a, speaker, used, one, instead, of, the, other, the, meaning, of, the, word, would, not, change, using, the, aspirated, form, in, skill, might, sound, odd, but, the, word, would, still, be, recognized, by, contrast, some, other, sounds, would, cause, a, change, in, meaning, if, substituted, for, example, substitution, of, the, sound, would, produce, the, different, word, s, t, ill, and, that, sound, must, therefore, be, considered, to, represent, a, different, phoneme, the, phoneme, t, the, above, shows, that, in, english, and, are, allophones, of, a, single, phoneme, k, in, some, languages, however, and, are, perceived, by, native, speakers, as, significantly, different, sounds, and, substituting, one, for, the, other, can, change, the, meaning, of, a, word, in, those, languages, therefore, the, two, sounds, represent, different, phonemes, for, example, in, icelandic, is, the, first, sound, of, k, tur, meaning, cheerful, but, is, the, first, sound, of, g, tur, meaning, riddles, icelandic, therefore, has, two, separate, phonemes, k, and, k, a, pair, of, words, like, k, tur, and, g, tur, above, that, differ, only, in, one, phone, is, called, a, minimal, pair, for, the, two, alternative, phones, in, question, in, this, case, and, the, existence, of, minimal, pairs, is, a, common, test, to, decide, whether, two, phones, represent, different, phonemes, or, are, allophones, of, the, same, phoneme, to, take, another, example, the, minimal, pair, t, ip, and, d, ip, illustrates, that, in, english, and, belong, to, separate, phonemes, t, and, d, since, the, words, have, different, meanings, english, speakers, must, be, conscious, of, the, distinction, between, the, two, sounds, signed, languages, such, as, american, sign, language, asl, also, have, minimal, pairs, differing, only, in, exactly, one, of, the, signs, parameters, handshape, movement, location, palm, orientation, and, nonmanual, signal, or, marker, a, minimal, pair, may, exist, in, the, signed, language, if, the, basic, sign, stays, the, same, but, one, of, the, parameters, changes, however, the, absence, of, minimal, pairs, for, a, given, pair, of, phones, does, not, always, mean, that, they, belong, to, the, same, phoneme, they, may, be, so, dissimilar, phonetically, that, it, is, unlikely, for, speakers, to, perceive, them, as, the, same, sound, for, example, english, has, no, minimal, pair, for, the, sounds, as, in, h, at, and, as, in, ba, ng, and, the, fact, that, they, can, be, shown, to, be, in, complementary, distribution, could, be, used, to, argue, for, their, being, allophones, of, the, same, phoneme, however, they, are, so, dissimilar, phonetically, that, they, are, considered, separate, phonemes, a, case, like, this, shows, that, sometimes, it, is, the, systemic, distinctions, and, not, the, lexical, context, which, are, decisive, in, establishing, phonemes, this, implies, that, the, phoneme, should, be, defined, as, the, smallest, phonological, unit, which, is, contrastive, at, a, lexical, level, or, distinctive, at, a, systemic, level, phonologists, have, sometimes, had, recourse, to, near, minimal, pairs, to, show, that, speakers, of, the, language, perceive, two, sounds, as, significantly, different, even, if, no, exact, minimal, pair, exists, in, the, lexicon, it, is, challenging, to, find, a, minimal, pair, to, distinguish, english, from, yet, it, seems, uncontroversial, to, claim, that, the, two, consonants, are, distinct, phonemes, the, two, words, pressure, p, r, r, and, pleasure, p, l, r, can, serve, as, a, near, minimal, pair, the, reason, why, this, is, still, acceptable, proof, of, phonemehood, is, that, there, is, nothing, about, the, additional, difference, r, vs, l, that, can, be, expected, to, somehow, condition, a, voicing, difference, for, a, single, underlying, postalveolar, fricative, one, can, however, find, true, minimal, pairs, for, and, if, less, common, words, are, considered, for, example, confucian, and, confusion, are, a, valid, minimal, pair, besides, segmental, phonemes, such, as, vowels, and, consonants, there, are, also, suprasegmental, features, of, pronunciation, such, as, tone, and, stress, syllable, boundaries, and, other, forms, of, juncture, nasalization, and, vowel, harmony, which, in, many, languages, change, the, meaning, of, words, and, so, are, phonemic, phonemic, stress, is, encountered, in, languages, such, as, english, for, example, there, are, two, words, spelled, invite, one, is, a, verb, and, is, stressed, on, the, second, syllable, the, other, is, a, noun, and, stressed, on, the, first, syllable, without, changing, any, of, the, individual, sounds, the, position, of, the, stress, distinguishes, the, words, and, so, a, full, phonemic, specification, would, include, indication, of, the, position, of, the, stress, n, va, t, for, the, verb, nva, t, for, the, noun, in, other, languages, such, as, french, word, stress, cannot, have, this, function, its, position, is, generally, predictable, and, so, it, is, not, phonemic, and, therefore, not, usually, indicated, in, dictionaries, phonemic, tones, are, found, in, languages, such, as, mandarin, chinese, in, which, a, given, syllable, can, have, five, different, tonal, pronunciations, the, tone, phonemes, in, such, languages, are, sometimes, called, tonemes, languages, such, as, english, do, not, have, phonemic, tone, but, they, use, intonation, for, functions, such, as, emphasis, and, attitude, when, a, phoneme, has, more, than, one, allophone, the, one, actually, heard, at, a, given, occurrence, of, that, phoneme, may, be, dependent, on, the, phonetic, environment, surrounding, sounds, allophones, that, normally, cannot, appear, in, the, same, environment, are, said, to, be, in, complementary, distribution, in, other, cases, the, choice, of, allophone, may, be, dependent, on, the, individual, speaker, or, other, unpredictable, factors, such, allophones, are, said, to, be, in, free, variation, but, allophones, are, still, selected, in, a, specific, phonetic, context, not, the, other, way, around, the, term, phon, me, from, ancient, greek, romanized, ph, n, ma, sound, made, utterance, thing, spoken, speech, language, was, reportedly, first, used, by, a, dufriche, desgenettes, in, 1873, but, it, referred, only, to, a, speech, sound, the, term, phoneme, as, an, abstraction, was, developed, by, the, polish, linguist, jan, baudouin, de, courtenay, and, his, student, miko, aj, kruszewski, during, 1875, 1895, the, term, used, by, these, two, was, fonema, the, basic, unit, of, what, they, called, psychophonetics, daniel, jones, became, the, first, linguist, in, the, western, world, to, use, the, term, phoneme, in, its, current, sense, employing, the, word, in, his, article, the, phonetic, structure, of, the, sechuana, language, the, concept, of, the, phoneme, was, then, elaborated, in, the, works, of, nikolai, trubetzkoy, and, others, of, the, prague, school, during, the, years, 1926, 1935, and, in, those, of, structuralists, like, ferdinand, de, saussure, edward, sapir, and, leonard, bloomfield, some, structuralists, though, not, sapir, rejected, the, idea, of, a, cognitive, or, psycholinguistic, function, for, the, phoneme, later, it, was, used, and, redefined, in, generative, linguistics, most, famously, by, noam, chomsky, and, morris, halle, and, remains, central, to, many, accounts, of, the, development, of, modern, phonology, as, a, theoretical, concept, or, model, though, it, has, been, supplemented, and, even, replaced, by, others, some, linguists, such, as, roman, jakobson, and, morris, halle, proposed, that, phonemes, may, be, further, decomposable, into, features, such, features, being, the, true, minimal, constituents, of, language, features, overlap, each, other, in, time, as, do, suprasegmental, phonemes, in, oral, language, and, many, phonemes, in, sign, languages, features, could, be, characterized, in, different, ways, jakobson, and, colleagues, defined, them, in, acoustic, terms, chomsky, and, halle, used, a, predominantly, articulatory, basis, though, retaining, some, acoustic, features, while, ladefoged, s, system, is, a, purely, articulatory, system, apart, from, the, use, of, the, acoustic, term, sibilant, in, the, description, of, some, languages, the, term, chroneme, has, been, used, to, indicate, contrastive, length, or, duration, of, phonemes, in, languages, in, which, tones, are, phonemic, the, tone, phonemes, may, be, called, tonemes, though, not, all, scholars, working, on, such, languages, use, these, terms, they, are, by, no, means, obsolete, by, analogy, with, the, phoneme, linguists, have, proposed, other, sorts, of, underlying, objects, giving, them, names, with, the, suffix, eme, such, as, morpheme, and, grapheme, these, are, sometimes, called, emic, units, the, latter, term, was, first, used, by, kenneth, pike, who, also, generalized, the, concepts, of, emic, and, etic, description, from, phonemic, and, phonetic, respectively, to, applications, outside, linguistics, languages, do, not, generally, allow, words, or, syllables, to, be, built, of, any, arbitrary, sequences, of, phonemes, there, are, phonotactic, restrictions, on, which, sequences, of, phonemes, are, possible, and, in, which, environments, certain, phonemes, can, occur, phonemes, that, are, significantly, limited, by, such, restrictions, may, be, called, restricted, phonemes, in, english, examples, of, such, restrictions, include, the, following, some, phonotactic, restrictions, can, alternatively, be, analyzed, as, cases, of, neutralization, see, neutralization, and, archiphonemes, below, particularly, the, example, of, the, occurrence, of, the, three, english, nasals, before, stops, biuniqueness, is, a, requirement, of, classic, structuralist, phonemics, it, means, that, a, given, phone, wherever, it, occurs, must, unambiguously, be, assigned, to, one, and, only, one, phoneme, in, other, words, the, mapping, between, phones, and, phonemes, is, required, to, be, many, to, one, rather, than, many, to, many, the, notion, of, biuniqueness, was, controversial, among, some, pre, generative, linguists, and, was, prominently, challenged, by, morris, halle, and, noam, chomsky, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, an, example, of, the, problems, arising, from, the, biuniqueness, requirement, is, provided, by, the, phenomenon, of, flapping, in, north, american, english, this, may, cause, either, t, or, d, in, the, appropriate, environments, to, be, realized, with, the, phone, an, alveolar, flap, for, example, the, same, flap, sound, may, be, heard, in, the, words, hi, tt, ing, and, bi, dd, ing, although, it, is, intended, to, realize, the, phoneme, t, in, the, first, word, and, d, in, the, second, this, appears, to, contradict, biuniqueness, for, further, discussion, of, such, cases, see, the, next, section, phonemes, that, are, contrastive, in, certain, environments, may, not, be, contrastive, in, all, environments, in, the, environments, where, they, do, not, contrast, the, contrast, is, said, to, be, neutralized, in, these, positions, it, may, become, less, clear, which, phoneme, a, given, phone, represents, absolute, neutralization, is, a, phenomenon, in, which, a, segment, of, the, underlying, representation, is, not, realized, in, any, of, its, phonetic, representations, surface, forms, the, term, was, introduced, by, paul, kiparsky, 1968, and, contrasts, with, contextual, neutralization, where, some, phonemes, are, not, contrastive, in, certain, environments, some, phonologists, prefer, not, to, specify, a, unique, phoneme, in, such, cases, since, to, do, so, would, mean, providing, redundant, or, even, arbitrary, information, instead, they, use, the, technique, of, underspecification, an, archiphoneme, is, an, object, sometimes, used, to, represent, an, underspecified, phoneme, an, example, of, neutralization, is, provided, by, the, russian, vowels, a, and, o, these, phonemes, are, contrasting, in, stressed, syllables, but, in, unstressed, syllables, the, contrast, is, lost, since, both, are, reduced, to, the, same, sound, usually, for, details, see, vowel, reduction, in, russian, in, order, to, assign, such, an, instance, of, to, one, of, the, phonemes, a, and, o, it, is, necessary, to, consider, morphological, factors, such, as, which, of, the, vowels, occurs, in, other, forms, of, the, words, or, which, inflectional, pattern, is, followed, in, some, cases, even, this, may, not, provide, an, unambiguous, answer, a, description, using, the, approach, of, underspecification, would, not, attempt, to, assign, to, a, specific, phoneme, in, some, or, all, of, these, cases, although, it, might, be, assigned, to, an, archiphoneme, written, something, like, a, which, reflects, the, two, neutralized, phonemes, in, this, position, or, a, o, reflecting, its, unmerged, values, a, somewhat, different, example, is, found, in, english, with, the, three, nasal, phonemes, m, n, in, word, final, position, these, all, contrast, as, shown, by, the, minimal, triplet, sum, s, m, sun, s, n, sung, s, however, before, a, stop, such, as, p, t, k, provided, there, is, no, morpheme, boundary, between, them, only, one, of, the, nasals, is, possible, in, any, given, position, m, before, p, n, before, t, or, d, and, before, k, as, in, limp, lint, link, l, mp, l, nt, l, k, the, nasals, are, therefore, not, contrastive, in, these, environments, and, according, to, some, theorists, this, makes, it, inappropriate, to, assign, the, nasal, phones, heard, here, to, any, one, of, the, phonemes, even, though, in, this, case, the, phonetic, evidence, is, unambiguous, instead, they, may, analyze, these, phonemes, as, belonging, to, a, single, archiphoneme, written, something, like, n, and, state, the, underlying, representations, of, limp, lint, link, to, be, l, np, l, nt, l, nk, this, latter, type, of, analysis, is, often, associated, with, nikolai, trubetzkoy, of, the, prague, school, archiphonemes, are, often, notated, with, a, capital, letter, within, double, virgules, or, pipes, as, with, the, examples, a, and, n, given, above, other, ways, the, second, of, these, has, been, notated, include, m, n, m, n, and, n, another, example, from, english, but, this, time, involving, complete, phonetic, convergence, as, in, the, russian, example, is, the, flapping, of, t, and, d, in, some, american, english, described, above, under, biuniqueness, here, the, words, betting, and, bedding, might, both, be, pronounced, under, the, generative, grammar, theory, of, linguistics, if, a, speaker, applies, such, flapping, consistently, morphological, evidence, the, pronunciation, of, the, related, forms, bet, and, bed, for, example, would, reveal, which, phoneme, the, flap, represents, once, it, is, known, which, morpheme, is, being, used, however, other, theorists, would, prefer, not, to, make, such, a, determination, and, simply, assign, the, flap, in, both, cases, to, a, single, archiphoneme, written, for, example, d, further, mergers, in, english, are, plosives, after, s, where, p, t, k, conflate, with, b, d, as, suggested, by, the, alternative, spellings, sketti, and, sghetti, that, is, there, is, no, particular, reason, to, transcribe, spin, as, sp, n, rather, than, as, sb, n, other, than, its, historical, development, and, it, might, be, less, ambiguously, transcribed, sb, n, a, morphophoneme, is, a, theoretical, unit, at, a, deeper, level, of, abstraction, than, traditional, phonemes, and, is, taken, to, be, a, unit, from, which, morphemes, are, built, up, a, morphophoneme, within, a, morpheme, can, be, expressed, in, different, ways, in, different, allomorphs, of, that, morpheme, according, to, morphophonological, rules, for, example, the, english, plural, morpheme, s, appearing, in, words, such, as, cats, and, dogs, can, be, considered, to, be, a, single, morphophoneme, which, might, be, transcribed, for, example, z, or, z, and, which, is, realized, phonemically, as, s, after, most, voiceless, consonants, as, in, cat, s, and, as, z, in, other, cases, as, in, dog, s, all, known, languages, use, only, a, small, subset, of, the, many, possible, sounds, that, the, human, speech, organs, can, produce, and, because, of, allophony, the, number, of, distinct, phonemes, will, generally, be, smaller, than, the, number, of, identifiably, different, sounds, different, languages, vary, considerably, in, the, number, of, phonemes, they, have, in, their, systems, although, apparent, variation, may, sometimes, result, from, the, different, approaches, taken, by, the, linguists, doing, the, analysis, the, total, phonemic, inventory, in, languages, varies, from, as, few, as, 9, 11, in, pirah, and, 11, in, rotokas, to, as, many, as, 141, in, x, the, number, of, phonemically, distinct, vowels, can, be, as, low, as, two, as, in, ubykh, and, arrernte, at, the, other, extreme, the, bantu, language, ngwe, has, 14, vowel, qualities, 12, of, which, may, occur, long, or, short, making, 26, oral, vowels, plus, six, nasalized, vowels, long, and, short, making, a, total, of, 38, vowels, while, x, achieves, 31, pure, vowels, not, counting, its, additional, variation, by, vowel, length, by, varying, the, phonation, as, regards, consonant, phonemes, puinave, and, the, papuan, language, tauade, each, have, just, seven, and, rotokas, has, only, six, x, on, the, other, hand, has, somewhere, around, 77, and, ubykh, 81, the, english, language, uses, a, rather, large, set, of, 13, to, 21, vowel, phonemes, including, diphthongs, although, its, 22, to, 26, consonants, are, close, to, average, across, all, languages, the, average, number, of, consonant, phonemes, per, language, is, about, 22, while, the, average, number, of, vowel, phonemes, is, about, 8, some, languages, such, as, french, have, no, phonemic, tone, or, stress, while, cantonese, and, several, of, the, kam, sui, languages, have, six, to, nine, tones, depending, on, how, they, are, counted, and, the, kam, sui, dong, language, has, nine, to, 15, tones, by, the, same, measure, one, of, the, kru, languages, wob, has, been, claimed, to, have, 14, though, this, is, disputed, the, most, common, vowel, system, consists, of, the, five, vowels, i, e, a, o, u, the, most, common, consonants, are, p, t, k, m, n, relatively, few, languages, lack, any, of, these, consonants, although, it, does, happen, for, example, arabic, lacks, p, standard, hawaiian, lacks, t, mohawk, and, tlingit, lack, p, and, m, hupa, lacks, both, p, and, a, simple, k, colloquial, samoan, lacks, t, and, n, while, rotokas, and, quileute, lack, m, and, n, during, the, development, of, phoneme, theory, in, the, mid, 20th, century, phonologists, were, concerned, not, only, with, the, procedures, and, principles, involved, in, producing, a, phonemic, analysis, of, the, sounds, of, a, given, language, but, also, with, the, reality, or, uniqueness, of, the, phonemic, solution, these, were, central, concerns, of, phonology, some, writers, took, the, position, expressed, by, kenneth, pike, there, is, only, one, accurate, phonemic, analysis, for, a, given, set, of, data, while, others, believed, that, different, analyses, equally, valid, could, be, made, for, the, same, data, yuen, ren, chao, 1934, in, his, article, the, non, uniqueness, of, phonemic, solutions, of, phonetic, systems, stated, given, the, sounds, of, a, language, there, are, usually, more, than, one, possible, way, of, reducing, them, to, a, set, of, phonemes, and, these, different, systems, or, solutions, are, not, simply, correct, or, incorrect, but, may, be, regarded, only, as, being, good, or, bad, for, various, purposes, the, linguist, f, w, householder, referred, to, this, argument, within, linguistics, as, god, s, truth, i, e, the, stance, that, a, given, language, has, an, intrinsic, structure, to, be, discovered, vs, hocus, pocus, i, e, the, stance, that, any, proposed, coherent, structure, is, as, good, as, any, other, different, analyses, of, the, english, vowel, system, may, be, used, to, illustrate, this, the, article, english, phonology, states, that, english, has, a, particularly, large, number, of, vowel, phonemes, and, that, there, are, 20, vowel, phonemes, in, received, pronunciation, 14, 16, in, general, american, and, 20, 21, in, australian, english, although, these, figures, are, often, quoted, as, fact, they, actually, reflect, just, one, of, many, possible, analyses, and, later, in, the, english, phonology, article, an, alternative, analysis, is, suggested, in, which, some, diphthongs, and, long, vowels, may, be, interpreted, as, comprising, a, short, vowel, linked, to, either, j, or, w, the, fullest, exposition, of, this, approach, is, found, in, trager, and, smith, 1951, where, all, long, vowels, and, diphthongs, complex, nuclei, are, made, up, of, a, short, vowel, combined, with, either, j, w, or, h, plus, r, for, rhotic, accents, each, comprising, two, phonemes, the, transcription, for, the, vowel, normally, transcribed, a, would, instead, be, aj, a, would, be, aw, and, would, be, ah, or, ar, in, a, rhotic, accent, if, there, is, an, r, in, the, spelling, it, is, also, possible, to, treat, english, long, vowels, and, diphthongs, as, combinations, of, two, vowel, phonemes, with, long, vowels, treated, as, a, sequence, of, two, short, vowels, so, that, palm, would, be, represented, as, paam, english, can, thus, be, said, to, have, around, seven, vowel, phonemes, or, even, six, if, schwa, were, treated, as, an, allophone, of, or, of, other, short, vowels, in, the, same, period, there, was, disagreement, about, the, correct, basis, for, a, phonemic, analysis, the, structuralist, position, was, that, the, analysis, should, be, made, purely, on, the, basis, of, the, sound, elements, and, their, distribution, with, no, reference, to, extraneous, factors, such, as, grammar, morphology, or, the, intuitions, of, the, native, speaker, this, position, is, strongly, associated, with, leonard, bloomfield, zellig, harris, claimed, that, it, is, possible, to, discover, the, phonemes, of, a, language, purely, by, examining, the, distribution, of, phonetic, segments, referring, to, mentalistic, definitions, of, the, phoneme, twaddell, 1935, stated, such, a, definition, is, invalid, because, 1, we, have, no, right, to, guess, about, the, linguistic, workings, of, an, inaccessible, mind, and, 2, we, can, secure, no, advantage, from, such, guesses, the, linguistic, processes, of, the, mind, as, such, are, quite, simply, unobservable, and, introspection, about, linguistic, processes, is, notoriously, a, fire, in, a, wooden, stove, this, approach, was, opposed, to, that, of, edward, sapir, who, gave, an, important, role, to, native, speakers, intuitions, about, where, a, particular, sound, or, group, of, sounds, fitted, into, a, pattern, using, english, as, an, example, sapir, argued, that, despite, the, superficial, appearance, that, this, sound, belongs, to, a, group, of, three, nasal, consonant, phonemes, m, n, and, native, speakers, feel, that, the, velar, nasal, is, really, the, sequence, the, theory, of, generative, phonology, which, emerged, in, the, 1960s, explicitly, rejected, the, structuralist, approach, to, phonology, and, favoured, the, mentalistic, or, cognitive, view, of, sapir, these, topics, are, discussed, further, in, english, phonology, controversial, issues, phonemes, are, considered, to, be, the, basis, for, alphabetic, writing, systems, in, such, systems, the, written, symbols, graphemes, represent, in, principle, the, phonemes, of, the, language, being, written, this, is, most, obviously, the, case, when, the, alphabet, was, invented, with, a, particular, language, in, mind, for, example, the, latin, alphabet, was, devised, for, classical, latin, and, therefore, the, latin, of, that, period, enjoyed, a, near, one, to, one, correspondence, between, phonemes, and, graphemes, in, most, cases, though, the, devisers, of, the, alphabet, chose, not, to, represent, the, phonemic, effect, of, vowel, length, however, because, changes, in, the, spoken, language, are, often, not, accompanied, by, changes, in, the, established, orthography, as, well, as, other, reasons, including, dialect, differences, the, effects, of, morphophonology, on, orthography, and, the, use, of, foreign, spellings, for, some, loanwords, the, correspondence, between, spelling, and, pronunciation, in, a, given, language, may, be, highly, distorted, this, is, the, case, with, english, for, example, the, correspondence, between, symbols, and, phonemes, in, alphabetic, writing, systems, is, not, necessarily, a, one, to, one, correspondence, a, phoneme, might, be, represented, by, a, combination, of, two, or, more, letters, digraph, trigraph, etc, like, sh, in, english, or, sch, in, german, both, representing, the, phoneme, also, a, single, letter, may, represent, two, phonemes, as, in, english, x, representing, gz, or, ks, there, may, also, exist, spelling, pronunciation, rules, such, as, those, for, the, pronunciation, of, c, in, italian, that, further, complicate, the, correspondence, of, letters, to, phonemes, although, they, need, not, affect, the, ability, to, predict, the, pronunciation, from, the, spelling, and, vice, versa, provided, the, rules, are, consistent, sign, language, phonemes, are, bundles, of, articulation, features, stokoe, was, the, first, scholar, to, describe, the, phonemic, system, of, asl, he, identified, the, bundles, tab, elements, of, location, from, latin, tabula, dez, the, handshape, from, designator, and, sig, the, motion, from, signation, some, researchers, also, discern, ori, orientation, facial, expression, or, mouthing, just, as, with, spoken, languages, when, features, are, combined, they, create, phonemes, as, in, spoken, languages, sign, languages, have, minimal, pairs, which, differ, in, only, one, phoneme, for, instance, the, asl, signs, for, father, and, mother, differ, minimally, with, respect, to, location, while, handshape, and, movement, are, identical, location, is, thus, contrastive, stokoe, s, terminology, and, notation, system, are, no, longer, used, by, researchers, to, describe, the, phonemes, of, sign, languages, william, stokoe, s, research, while, still, considered, seminal, has, been, found, not, to, characterize, american, sign, language, or, other, sign, languages, sufficiently, for, instance, non, manual, features, are, not, included, in, stokoe, s, classification, more, sophisticated, models, of, sign, language, phonology, have, since, been, proposed, by, brentari, sandler, and, van, der, kooij, cherology, and, chereme, from, ancient, greek, hand, are, synonyms, of, phonology, and, phoneme, previously, used, in, the, study, of, sign, languages, a, chereme, as, the, basic, unit, of, signed, communication, is, functionally, and, psychologically, equivalent, to, the, phonemes, of, oral, languages, and, has, been, replaced, by, that, term, in, the, academic, literature, cherology, as, the, study, of, cheremes, in, language, is, thus, equivalent, to, phonology, the, terms, are, not, in, use, anymore, instead, the, terms, phonology, and, phoneme, or, distinctive, feature, are, used, to, stress, the, linguistic, similarities, between, signed, and, spoken, languages, the, terms, were, coined, in, 1960, by, william, stokoe, at, gallaudet, university, to, describe, sign, languages, as, true, and, full, languages, once, a, controversial, idea, the, position, is, now, universally, accepted, in, linguistics, stokoe, s, terminology, however, has, been, largely, abandoned
