underlying, cult, of, violence, it, subscribed, to, pseudo, scientific, theories, of, a, racial, hierarchy, identifying, ethnic, germans, as, part, of, what, the, nazis, regarded, as, an, aryan, or, nordic, master, race, nazism, sought, to, overcome, social, divisions, and, create, a, homogeneous, german, society, based, on, racial, purity, which, represented, a, people, s, community,

common, good, accepting, political, interests, as, the, main, priority, of, economic, organisation, which, tended, to, match, the, general, outlook, of, collectivism, or, communitarianism, rather, than, economic, socialism, the, nazi, party, s, precursor, the, pan, german, nationalist, and, antisemitic, german, workers, party, dap, was, founded, on, 5, january, 1919, by, the, early, 1920s, the, party, was, renamed, the, national, socialist, german, workers, party, in, order, to, appeal, to, left, wing, workers, a, renaming, that, hitler, initially, objected, to, the, national, socialist, program, or, 25, points, was, adopted, in, 1920, and, called, for, a, united, greater, germany, that, would, deny, citizenship, to, jews, or, those, of, jewish, descent, while, also, supporting, land, reform, and, the, nationalisation, of, some, industries, in, mein, kampf, my, struggle, published, in, 1925, 1926, hitler, outlined, the, antisemitism, and, anti, communism, at, the, heart, of, his, political, philosophy, as, well, as, his, disdain, for, representative, democracy, over, which, he, proposed, the, f, hrerprinzip, leader, principle, and, his, belief, in, germany, s, right, to, territorial, expansion, through, lebensraum, hitler, s, objectives, involved, the, eastward, expansion, of, german, territories, german, colonization, of, eastern, europe, and, the, promotion, of, an, alliance, with, britain, and, italy, against, the, soviet, union, the, nazi, party, won, the, greatest, share, of, the, popular, vote, in, the, two, reichstag, general, elections, of, 1932, making, them, the, largest, party, in, the, legislature, by, far, albeit, still, short, of, an, outright, majority, 37, 3, on, 31, july, 1932, and, 33, 1, on, 6, november, 1932, because, none, of, the, parties, were, willing, or, able, to, put, together, a, coalition, government, hitler, was, appointed, chancellor, of, germany, on, 30, january, 1933, by, president, paul, von, hindenburg, through, the, support, and, connivance, of, traditional, conservative, nationalists, who, believed, that, they, could, control, him, and, his, party, with, the, use, of, emergency, presidential, decrees, by, hindenburg, and, a, change, in, the, weimar, constitution, which, allowed, the, cabinet, to, rule, by, direct, decree, bypassing, both, hindenburg, and, the, reichstag, the, nazis, soon, established, a, one, party, state, and, began, the, gleichschaltung, the, sturmabteilung, sa, and, the, schutzstaffel, ss, functioned, as, the, paramilitary, organisations, of, the, nazi, party, using, the, ss,

the, death, of, president, hindenburg, on, 2, august, 1934, political, power, was, concentrated, in, hitler, s, hands, and, he, became, germany, s, head, of, state, as, well, as, the, head, of, the, government, with, the, title, of, f, hrer, und, reichskanzler, meaning, leader, and, chancellor, of, germany, see, also, here, from, that, point, hitler, was, effectively, the, dictator, of, nazi, germany, also, known, as, the, third, reich, under, which, jews, political, opponents, and, other, undesirable, elements, were, marginalised, imprisoned, or, murdered, during, world, war, ii, many, millions, of, people, including, around, two, thirds, of, the, jewish, population, of, europe, were, eventually, exterminated, in, a, genocide, which, became, known, as, the, holocaust, following, germany, s, defeat, in, world, war, ii, and, the, discovery, of, the, full, extent, of, the, holocaust, nazi, ideology, became, universally, disgraced, it, is, widely, regarded, as, evil, with, only, a, few, fringe, racist, groups, usually, referred, to, as, neo, nazis, describing, themselves, as, followers, of, national, socialism, the, use, of, nazi, symbols, is, outlawed, in, many, european, countries, including, germany, and, austria, the, full, name, of, the, nazi, party, was, nationalsozialistische, deutsche, arbeiterpartei, german, for, national, socialist, german, workers, party, and, they, officially, used, the, acronym, nsdap, the, term, nazi, had, been, in, use, before, the, rise, of, the, nsdap, as, a, colloquial, and, derogatory, word, for, a, backwards, farmer, or, peasant, it, characterised, an, awkward, and, clumsy, person, a, yokel, in, this, sense, the, word, nazi, was, a, hypocorism, of, the, german, male, name, igna, t, z, itself, a, variation, of, the, name, ignatius, igna, t, z, being, a, common, name, at, the, time, in, bavaria, the, area, from, which, the, nsdap, emerged, in, the, 1920s, political, opponents, of, the, nsdap, in, the, german, labour, movement, seized, on, this, using, the, earlier, abbreviated, term, sozi, for, sozialist, german, for, socialist, as, an, example, they, shortened, the, nsdap, s, name, nationalsozialistische, to, the, dismissive, nazi, in, order, to, associate, them, with, the, derogatory, use, of, the, aforementioned, term, the, first, use, of, the, term, nazi, by, the, national, socialists, occurred, in, 1926, in, a, publication, by, joseph, goebbels, called, der, nazi, sozi, in, goebbels, pamphlet, the, word, nazi, only, appears, when, linked, with, the, word, sozi, as, an, abbreviation, of, national, socialism, after, the, nsdap, s, rise, to, power, in, the, 1930s, the, use, of, the, term, nazi, by, itself, or, in, terms, such, as, nazi, germany, nazi, regime, and, so, on, was, popularised, by, german, exiles, outside, the, country, but, not, in, germany, from, them, the, term, spread, into, other, languages, and, it, was, eventually, brought, back, into, germany, after, world, war, ii, the, nsdap, briefly, adopted, the, designation, nazi, in, an, attempt, to, reappropriate, the, term, but, it, soon, gave, up, this, effort, and, generally, avoided, using, the, term, while, it, was, in, power, in, each, case, the, authors, typically, referred, to, themselves, as, national, socialists, and, their, movement, as, national, socialism, but, never, as, nazis, a, compendium, of, hitler, s, conversations, from, 1941, through, 1944, entitled, hitler, s, table, talk, does, not, contain, the, word, nazi, either, in, speeches, by, hermann, g, ring, he, never, uses, the, term, nazi, hitler, youth, leader, melita, maschmann, wrote, a, book, about, her, experience, entitled, account, rendered, she, did, not, refer, to, herself, as, a, nazi, even, though, she, was, writing, well, after, world, war, ii, in, 1933, 581, members, of, the, national, socialist, party, answered, interview, questions, put, to, them, by, professor, theodore, abel, from, columbia, university, they, similarly, did, not, refer, to, themselves, as, nazis, the, majority, of, scholars, identify, nazism, in, both, theory, and, practice, as, a, form, of, far, right, politics, far, right, themes, in, nazism, include, the, argument, that, superior, people, have, a, right, to, dominate, other, people, and, purge, society, of, supposed, inferior, elements, adolf, hitler, and, other, proponents, denied, that, nazism, was, either, left, wing, or, right, wing, instead, they, officially, portrayed, nazism, as, a, syncretic, movement, in, mein, kampf, hitler, directly, attacked, both, left, wing, and, right, wing, politics, in, germany, saying, today, our, left, wing, politicians, in, particular, are, constantly, insisting, that, their, craven, hearted, and, obsequious, foreign, policy, necessarily, results, from, the, disarmament, of, germany, whereas, the, truth, is, that, this, is, the, policy, of, traitors, but, the, politicians, of, the, right, deserve, exactly, the, same, reproach, it, was, through, their, miserable, cowardice, that, those, ruffians, of, jews, who, came, into, power, in, 1918, were, able, to, rob, the, nation, of, its, arms, in, a, speech, given, in, munich, on, 12, april, 1922, hitler, stated, there, are, only, two, possibilities, in, germany, do, not, imagine, that, the, people, will, forever, go, with, the, middle, party, the, party, of, compromises, one, day, it, will, turn, to, those, who, have, most, consistently, foretold, the, coming, ruin, and, have, sought, to, dissociate, themselves, from, it, and, that, party, is, either, the, left, and, then, god, help, us, for, it, will, lead, us, to, complete, destruction, to, bolshevism, or, else, it, is, a, party, of, the, right, which, at, the, last, when, the, people, is, in, utter, despair, when, it, has, lost, all, its, spirit, and, has, no, longer, any, faith, in, anything, is, determined, for, its, part, ruthlessly, to, seize, the, reins, of, power, that, is, the, beginning, of, resistance, of, which, i, spoke, a, few, minutes, ago, hitler, at, times, redefined, socialism, when, george, sylvester, viereck, interviewed, hitler, in, october, 1923, and, asked, him, why, he, referred, to, his, party, as, socialists, he, replied, socialism, is, the, science, of, dealing, with, the, common, weal, communism, is, not, socialism, marxism, is, not, socialism, the, marxians, have, stolen, the, term, and, confused, its, meaning, i, shall, take, socialism, away, from, the, socialists, socialism, is, an, ancient, aryan, germanic, institution, our, german, ancestors, held, certain, lands, in, common, they, cultivated, the, idea, of, the, common, weal, marxism, has, no, right, to, disguise, itself, as, socialism, socialism, unlike, marxism, does, not, repudiate, private, property, unlike, marxism, it, involves, no, negation, of, personality, and, unlike, marxism, it, is, patriotic, in, 1929, hitler, gave, a, speech, to, a, group, of, nazi, leaders, and, simplified, socialism, to, mean, socialism, that, is, an, unfortunate, word, altogether, what, does, socialism, really, mean, if, people, have, something, to, eat, and, their, pleasures, then, they, have, their, socialism, when, asked, in, an, interview, on, 27, january, 1934, whether, he, supported, the, bourgeois, right, wing, hitler, claimed, that, nazism, was, not, exclusively, for, any, class, and, he, indicated, that, it, favoured, neither, the, left, nor, the, right, but, preserved, pure, elements, from, both, camps, by, stating, from, the, camp, of, bourgeois, tradition, it, takes, national, resolve, and, from, the, materialism, of, the, marxist, dogma, living, creative, socialism, historians, regard, the, equation, of, nazism, as, hitlerism, as, too, simplistic, since, the, term, was, used, prior, to, the, rise, of, hitler, and, the, nazis, in, addition, the, different, ideologies, incorporated, into, nazism, were, already, well, established, in, certain, parts, of, german, society, long, before, world, war, i, the, nazis, were, strongly, influenced, by, the, post, world, war, i, far, right, in, germany, which, held, common, beliefs, such, as, anti, marxism, anti, liberalism, and, antisemitism, along, with, nationalism, contempt, for, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, condemnation, of, the, weimar, republic, for, signing, the, armistice, in, november, 1918, which, later, led, it, to, sign, the, treaty, of, versailles, a, major, inspiration, for, the, nazis, were, the, far, right, nationalist, freikorps, paramilitary, organisations, that, engaged, in, political, violence, after, world, war, i, initially, the, post, world, war, i, german, far, right, was, dominated, by, monarchists, but, the, younger, generation, which, was, associated, with, v, lkisch, nationalism, was, more, radical, and, it, did, not, express, any, emphasis, on, the, restoration, of, the, german, monarchy, this, younger, generation, desired, to, dismantle, the, weimar, republic, and, create, a, new, radical, and, strong, state, based, upon, a, martial, ruling, ethic, that, could, revive, the, spirit, of, 1914, which, was, associated, with, german, national, unity, volksgemeinschaft, the, nazis, the, far, right, monarchists, the, reactionary, german, national, people, s, party, dnvp, and, others, such, as, monarchist, officers, in, the, german, army, and, several, prominent, industrialists, formed, an, alliance, in, opposition, to, the, weimar, republic, on, 11, october, 1931, in, bad, harzburg, officially, known, as, the, national, front, but, commonly, referred, to, as, the, harzburg, front, the, nazis, stated, that, the, alliance, was, purely, tactical, and, they, continued, to, have, differences, with, the, dnvp, after, the, elections, of, july, 1932, the, alliance, broke, down, when, the, dnvp, lost, many, of, its, seats, in, the, reichstag, the, nazis, denounced, them, as, an, insignificant, heap, of, reactionaries, the, dnvp, responded, by, denouncing, the, nazis, for, their, socialism, their, street, violence, and, the, economic, experiments, that, would, take, place, if, the, nazis, ever, rose, to, power, however, amidst, an, inconclusive, political, situation, in, which, conservative, politicians, franz, von, papen, and, kurt, von, schleicher, were, unable, to, form, stable, governments, without, the, nazis, papen, proposed, to, president, hindenburg, to, appoint, hitler, as, chancellor, at, the, head, of, a, government, formed, primarily, of, conservatives, with, only, three, nazi, ministers, hindenburg, did, so, and, contrary, to, the, expectations, of, papen, and, the, dnvp, hitler, was, soon, able, to, establish, a, nazi, one, party, dictatorship, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, who, was, pressured, to, abdicate, the, throne, and, flee, into, exile, amidst, an, attempted, communist, revolution, in, germany, initially, supported, the, nazi, party, his, four, sons, including, prince, eitel, friedrich, and, prince, oskar, became, members, of, the, nazi, party, in, hopes, that, in, exchange, for, their, support, the, nazis, would, permit, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, hitler, dismissed, the, possibility, of, a, restored, monarchy, calling, it, idiotic, wilhelm, grew, to, distrust, hitler, and, was, appalled, at, the, kristallnacht, of, 9, 10, november, 1938, stating, for, the, first, time, i, am, ashamed, to, be, a, german, the, former, german, emperor, also, denounced, the, nazis, as, a, bunch, of, shirted, gangsters, and, a, mob, led, by, a, thousand, liars, or, fanatics, there, were, factions, within, the, nazi, party, both, conservative, and, radical, the, conservative, nazi, hermann, g, ring, urged, hitler, to, conciliate, with, capitalists, and, reactionaries, other, prominent, conservative, nazis, included, heinrich, himmler, and, reinhard, heydrich, meanwhile, the, radical, nazi, joseph, goebbels, opposed, capitalism, viewing, it, as, having, jews, at, its, core, and, he, stressed, the, need, for, the, party, to, emphasise, both, a, proletarian, and, a, national, character, those, views, were, shared, by, otto, strasser, who, later, left, the, nazi, party, and, formed, the, black, front, in, the, belief, that, hitler, had, allegedly, betrayed, the, party, s, socialist, goals, by, endorsing, capitalism, when, the, nazi, party, emerged, from, obscurity, to, become, a, major, political, force, after, 1929, the, conservative, faction, rapidly, gained, more, influence, as, wealthy, donors, took, an, interest, in, the, nazis, as, a, potential, bulwark, against, communism, the, nazi, party, had, previously, been, financed, almost, entirely, from, membership, dues, but, after, 1929, its, leadership, began, actively, seeking, donations, from, german, industrialists, and, hitler, began, holding, dozens, of, fundraising, meetings, with, business, leaders, in, the, midst, of, the, great, depression, facing, the, possibility, of, economic, ruin, on, the, one, hand, and, a, communist, or, social, democrat, government, on, the, other, hand, german, business, increasingly, turned, to, nazism, as, offering, a, way, out, of, the, situation, by, promising, a, state, driven, economy, that, would, support, rather, than, attack, existing, business, interests, by, january, 1933, the, nazi, party, had, secured, the, support, of, important, sectors, of, german, industry, mainly, among, the, steel, and, coal, producers, the, insurance, business, and, the, chemical, industry, large, segments, of, the, nazi, party, particularly, among, the, members, of, the, sturmabteilung, sa, were, committed, to, the, party, s, official, socialist, revolutionary, and, anti, capitalist, positions, and, expected, both, a, social, and, an, economic, revolution, when, the, party, gained, power, in, 1933, in, the, period, immediately, before, the, nazi, seizure, of, power, there, were, even, social, democrats, and, communists, who, switched, sides, and, became, known, as, beefsteak, nazis, brown, on, the, outside, and, red, inside, the, leader, of, the, sa, ernst, r, hm, pushed, for, a, second, revolution, the, first, revolution, being, the, nazis, seizure, of, power, that, would, enact, socialist, policies, furthermore, r, hm, desired, that, the, sa, absorb, the, much, smaller, german, army, into, its, ranks, under, his, leadership, once, the, nazis, achieved, power, r, hm, s, sa, was, directed, by, hitler, to, violently, suppress, the, parties, of, the, left, but, they, also, began, attacks, against, individuals, deemed, to, be, associated, with, conservative, reaction, hitler, saw, r, hm, s, independent, actions, as, violating, and, possibly, threatening, his, leadership, as, well, as, jeopardising, the, regime, by, alienating, the, conservative, president, paul, von, hindenburg, and, the, conservative, oriented, german, army, this, resulted, in, hitler, purging, r, hm, and, other, radical, members, of, the, sa, in, 1934, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, night, of, the, long, knives, before, he, joined, the, bavarian, army, to, fight, in, world, war, i, hitler, had, lived, a, bohemian, lifestyle, as, a, petty, street, watercolour, artist, in, vienna, and, munich, and, he, maintained, elements, of, this, lifestyle, later, on, going, to, bed, very, late, and, rising, in, the, afternoon, even, after, he, became, chancellor, and, then, f, hrer, after, the, war, his, battalion, was, absorbed, by, the, bavarian, soviet, republic, from, 1918, to, 1919, where, he, was, elected, deputy, battalion, representative, according, to, historian, thomas, weber, hitler, attended, the, funeral, of, communist, kurt, eisner, a, german, jew, wearing, a, black, mourning, armband, on, one, arm, and, a, red, communist, armband, on, the, other, which, he, took, as, evidence, that, hitler, s, political, beliefs, had, not, yet, solidified, in, mein, kampf, hitler, never, mentioned, any, service, with, the, bavarian, soviet, republic, and, he, stated, that, he, became, an, antisemite, in, 1913, during, his, years, in, vienna, this, statement, has, been, disputed, by, the, contention, that, he, was, not, an, antisemite, at, that, time, even, though, it, is, well, established, that, he, read, many, antisemitic, tracts, and, journals, during, that, time, and, admired, karl, lueger, the, antisemitic, mayor, of, vienna, hitler, altered, his, political, views, in, response, to, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, june, 1919, and, it, was, then, that, he, became, an, antisemitic, german, nationalist, hitler, expressed, opposition, to, capitalism, regarding, it, as, having, jewish, origins, and, accusing, capitalism, of, holding, nations, ransom, to, the, interests, of, a, parasitic, cosmopolitan, rentier, class, he, also, expressed, opposition, to, communism, and, egalitarian, forms, of, socialism, arguing, that, inequality, and, hierarchy, are, beneficial, to, the, nation, he, believed, that, communism, was, invented, by, the, jews, to, weaken, nations, by, promoting, class, struggle, after, his, rise, to, power, hitler, took, a, pragmatic, position, on, economics, accepting, private, property, and, allowing, capitalist, private, enterprises, to, exist, so, long, as, they, adhered, to, the, goals, of, the, nazi, state, but, not, tolerating, enterprises, that, he, saw, as, being, opposed, to, the, national, interest, german, business, leaders, disliked, nazi, ideology, but, came, to, support, hitler, because, they, saw, the, nazis, as, a, useful, ally, to, promote, their, interests, business, groups, made, significant, financial, contributions, to, the, nazi, party, both, before, and, after, the, nazi, seizure, of, power, in, the, hope, that, a, nazi, dictatorship, would, eliminate, the, organised, labour, movement, and, the, left, wing, parties, hitler, actively, sought, to, gain, the, support, of, business, leaders, by, arguing, that, private, enterprise, is, incompatible, with, democracy, although, he, opposed, communist, ideology, hitler, publicly, praised, the, soviet, union, s, leader, joseph, stalin, and, stalinism, on, numerous, occasions, hitler, commended, stalin, for, seeking, to, purify, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, of, jewish, influences, noting, stalin, s, purging, of, jewish, communists, such, as, leon, trotsky, grigory, zinoviev, lev, kamenev, and, karl, radek, while, hitler, had, always, intended, to, bring, germany, into, conflict, with, the, soviet, union, so, he, could, gain, lebensraum, living, space, he, supported, a, temporary, strategic, alliance, between, nazi, germany, and, the, soviet, union, to, form, a, common, anti, liberal, front, so, they, could, defeat, liberal, democracies, particularly, france, hitler, admired, the, british, empire, and, its, colonial, system, as, living, proof, of, germanic, superiority, over, inferior, races, and, saw, the, united, kingdom, as, germany, s, natural, ally, he, wrote, in, mein, kampf, for, a, long, time, to, come, there, will, be, only, two, powers, in, europe, with, which, it, may, be, possible, for, germany, to, conclude, an, alliance, these, powers, are, great, britain, and, italy, the, historical, roots, of, nazism, are, to, be, found, in, various, elements, of, european, political, culture, which, were, in, circulation, in, the, intellectual, capitals, of, the, continent, what, joachim, fest, called, the, scrapheap, of, ideas, prevalent, at, the, time, in, hitler, and, the, collapse, of, the, weimar, republic, historian, martin, broszat, points, out, that, lmost, all, essential, elements, of, nazi, ideology, were, to, be, found, in, the, radical, positions, of, ideological, protest, movements, these, were, a, virulent, anti, semitism, a, blood, and, soil, ideology, the, notion, of, a, master, race, the, idea, of, territorial, acquisition, and, settlement, in, the, east, these, ideas, were, embedded, in, a, popular, nationalism, which, was, vigorously, anti, modernist, anti, humanist, and, pseudo, religious, brought, together, the, result, was, an, anti, intellectual, and, politically, semi, illiterate, ideology, lacking, cohesion, a, product, of, mass, culture, which, allowed, its, followers, emotional, attachment, and, offered, a, simplified, and, easily, digestible, world, view, based, on, a, political, mythology, for, the, masses, adolf, hitler, himself, along, with, other, members, of, the, national, socialist, german, workers, party, german, nationalsozialistische, deutsche, arbeiterpartei, nsdap, in, the, weimar, republic, 1918, 1933, were, greatly, influenced, by, several, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, thinkers, and, proponents, of, philosophical, onto, epistemic, and, theoretical, perspectives, on, ecological, anthropology, scientific, racism, holistic, science, and, organicism, regarding, the, constitution, of, complex, systems, and, theorization, of, organic, racial, societies, in, particular, one, of, the, most, significant, ideological, influences, on, the, nazis, was, the, 19th, century, german, nationalist, philosopher, johann, gottlieb, fichte, whose, works, had, served, as, an, inspiration, to, hitler, and, other, nazi, party, members, and, whose, ideas, were, implemented, among, the, philosophical, and, ideological, foundations, of, nazi, oriented, v, lkisch, nationalism, fichte, s, works, served, as, an, inspiration, to, hitler, and, other, nazi, party, members, including, dietrich, eckart, and, arnold, fanck, in, speeches, to, the, german, nation, 1808, written, amid, the, first, french, empire, s, occupation, of, berlin, during, the, napoleonic, wars, fichte, called, for, a, german, national, revolution, against, the, french, imperial, army, occupiers, making, passionate, public, speeches, arming, his, students, for, battle, against, the, french, and, stressing, the, need, for, action, by, the, german, nation, so, it, could, free, itself, fichte, s, german, nationalism, was, populist, and, opposed, to, traditional, elites, spoke, of, the, need, for, a, people, s, war, volkskrieg, and, put, forth, concepts, similar, to, those, which, the, nazis, adopted, fichte, promoted, german, exceptionalism, and, stressed, the, need, for, the, german, nation, to, purify, itself, including, purging, the, german, language, of, french, words, a, policy, that, the, nazis, undertook, upon, their, rise, to, power, another, important, figure, in, pre, nazi, v, lkisch, thinking, was, wilhelm, heinrich, riehl, whose, work, land, und, leute, land, and, people, written, between, 1857, and, 1863, collectively, tied, the, organic, german, volk, to, its, native, landscape, and, nature, a, pairing, which, stood, in, stark, opposition, to, the, mechanical, and, materialistic, civilisation, which, was, then, developing, as, a, result, of, industrialisation, geographers, friedrich, ratzel, and, karl, haushofer, borrowed, from, riehl, s, work, as, did, nazi, ideologues, alfred, rosenberg, and, paul, schultze, naumburg, both, of, whom, employed, some, of, riehl, s, philosophy, in, arguing, that, each, nation, state, was, an, organism, that, required, a, particular, living, space, in, order, to, survive, riehl, s, influence, is, overtly, discernible, in, the, blut, und, boden, blood, and, soil, philosophy, introduced, by, oswald, spengler, which, the, nazi, agriculturalist, walther, darr, and, other, prominent, nazis, adopted, v, lkisch, nationalism, denounced, soulless, materialism, individualism, and, secularised, urban, industrial, society, while, advocating, a, superior, society, based, on, ethnic, german, folk, culture, and, german, blood, it, denounced, foreigners, and, foreign, ideas, and, declared, that, jews, freemasons, and, others, were, traitors, to, the, nation, and, unworthy, of, inclusion, v, lkisch, nationalism, saw, the, world, in, terms, of, natural, law, and, romanticism, and, it, viewed, societies, as, organic, extolling, the, virtues, of, rural, life, condemning, the, neglect, of, tradition, and, the, decay, of, morals, denounced, the, destruction, of, the, natural, environment, and, condemned, cosmopolitan, cultures, such, as, jews, and, romani, the, first, party, that, attempted, to, combine, nationalism, and, socialism, was, the, austria, hungary, german, workers, party, which, predominantly, aimed, to, solve, the, conflict, between, the, austrian, germans, and, the, czechs, in, the, multi, ethnic, austrian, empire, then, part, of, austria, hungary, in, 1896, the, german, politician, friedrich, naumann, formed, the, national, social, association, which, aimed, to, combine, german, nationalism, and, a, non, marxist, form, of, socialism, together, the, attempt, turned, out, to, be, futile, and, the, idea, of, linking, nationalism, with, socialism, quickly, became, equated, with, antisemites, extreme, german, nationalists, and, the, v, lkisch, movement, in, general, during, the, era, of, the, german, empire, v, lkisch, nationalism, was, overshadowed, by, both, prussian, patriotism, and, the, federalist, tradition, of, its, various, component, states, the, events, of, world, war, i, including, the, end, of, the, prussian, monarchy, in, germany, resulted, in, a, surge, of, revolutionary, v, lkisch, nationalism, the, nazis, supported, such, revolutionary, v, lkisch, nationalist, policies, and, they, claimed, that, their, ideology, was, influenced, by, the, leadership, and, policies, of, german, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, who, was, instrumental, in, founding, the, german, empire, the, nazis, declared, that, they, were, dedicated, to, continuing, the, process, of, creating, a, unified, german, nation, state, that, bismarck, had, begun, and, desired, to, achieve, while, hitler, was, supportive, of, bismarck, s, creation, of, the, german, empire, he, was, critical, of, bismarck, s, moderate, domestic, policies, on, the, issue, of, bismarck, s, support, of, a, kleindeutschland, lesser, germany, excluding, austria, versus, the, pan, german, gro, deutschland, greater, germany, which, the, nazis, advocated, hitler, stated, that, bismarck, s, attainment, of, kleindeutschland, was, the, highest, achievement, bismarck, could, have, achieved, within, the, limits, possible, at, that, time, in, mein, kampf, hitler, presented, himself, as, a, second, bismarck, during, his, youth, in, austria, hitler, was, politically, influenced, by, austrian, pan, germanist, proponent, georg, ritter, von, sch, nerer, who, advocated, radical, german, nationalism, antisemitism, anti, catholicism, anti, slavic, sentiment, and, anti, habsburg, views, from, von, sch, nerer, and, his, followers, hitler, adopted, for, the, nazi, movement, the, heil, greeting, the, f, hrer, title, and, the, model, of, absolute, party, leadership, hitler, was, also, impressed, by, the, populist, antisemitism, and, the, anti, liberal, bourgeois, agitation, of, karl, lueger, who, as, the, mayor, of, vienna, during, hitler, s, time, in, the, city, used, a, rabble, rousing, style, of, oratory, that, appealed, to, the, wider, masses, unlike, von, sch, nerer, lueger, was, not, a, german, nationalist, and, instead, was, a, pro, catholic, habsburg, supporter, and, only, used, german, nationalist, notions, occasionally, for, his, own, agenda, although, hitler, praised, both, lueger, and, sch, nerer, he, criticised, the, former, for, not, applying, a, racial, doctrine, against, the, jews, and, slavs, the, concept, of, the, aryan, race, which, the, nazis, promoted, stems, from, racial, theories, asserting, that, europeans, are, the, descendants, of, indo, iranian, settlers, people, of, ancient, india, and, ancient, persia, proponents, of, this, theory, based, their, assertion, on, the, fact, that, words, in, european, languages, and, words, in, indo, iranian, languages, have, similar, pronunciations, and, meanings, johann, gottfried, herder, argued, that, the, germanic, peoples, held, close, racial, connections, to, the, ancient, indians, and, the, ancient, persians, who, he, claimed, were, advanced, peoples, that, possessed, a, great, capacity, for, wisdom, nobility, restraint, and, science, contemporaries, of, herder, used, the, concept, of, the, aryan, race, to, draw, a, distinction, between, what, they, deemed, to, be, high, and, noble, aryan, culture, versus, that, of, parasitic, semitic, culture, notions, of, white, supremacy, and, aryan, racial, superiority, were, combined, in, the, 19th, century, with, white, supremacists, maintaining, the, belief, that, certain, groups, of, white, people, were, members, of, an, aryan, master, race, that, is, superior, to, other, races, and, particularly, superior, to, the, semitic, race, which, they, associated, with, cultural, sterility, arthur, de, gobineau, a, french, racial, theorist, and, aristocrat, blamed, the, fall, of, the, ancien, r, gime, in, france, on, racial, degeneracy, caused, by, racial, intermixing, which, he, argued, had, destroyed, the, purity, of, the, aryan, race, a, term, which, he, only, reserved, for, germanic, people, gobineau, s, theories, which, attracted, a, strong, following, in, germany, emphasised, the, existence, of, an, irreconcilable, polarity, between, aryan, germanic, and, jewish, cultures, aryan, mysticism, claimed, that, christianity, originated, in, aryan, religious, traditions, and, that, jews, had, usurped, the, legend, from, aryans, houston, stewart, chamberlain, an, english, born, german, proponent, of, racial, theory, supported, notions, of, germanic, supremacy, and, antisemitism, in, germany, chamberlain, s, work, the, foundations, of, the, nineteenth, century, 1899, praised, germanic, peoples, for, their, creativity, and, idealism, while, asserting, that, the, germanic, spirit, was, threatened, by, a, jewish, spirit, of, selfishness, and, materialism, chamberlain, used, his, thesis, to, promote, monarchical, conservatism, while, denouncing, democracy, liberalism, and, socialism, the, book, became, popular, especially, in, germany, chamberlain, stressed, a, nation, s, need, to, maintain, its, racial, purity, in, order, to, prevent, its, degeneration, and, argued, that, racial, intermingling, with, jews, should, never, be, permitted, in, 1923, chamberlain, met, hitler, whom, he, admired, as, a, leader, of, the, rebirth, of, the, free, spirit, madison, grant, s, work, the, passing, of, the, great, race, 1916, advocated, nordicism, and, proposed, that, a, eugenics, program, should, be, implemented, in, order, to, preserve, the, purity, of, the, nordic, race, after, reading, the, book, hitler, called, it, my, bible, in, germany, the, belief, that, jews, were, economically, exploiting, germans, became, prominent, due, to, the, ascendancy, of, many, wealthy, jews, into, prominent, positions, upon, the, unification, of, germany, in, 1871, from, 1871, to, the, early, 20th, century, german, jews, were, overrepresented, in, germany, s, upper, and, middle, classes, while, they, were, underrepresented, in, germany, s, lower, classes, particularly, in, the, fields, of, agricultural, and, industrial, labour, german, jewish, financiers, and, bankers, played, a, key, role, in, fostering, germany, s, economic, growth, from, 1871, to, 1913, and, they, benefited, enormously, from, this, boom, in, 1908, amongst, the, twenty, nine, wealthiest, german, families, with, aggregate, fortunes, of, up, to, 55, million, marks, at, the, time, five, were, jewish, and, the, rothschilds, were, the, second, wealthiest, german, family, the, predominance, of, jews, in, germany, s, banking, commerce, and, industry, sectors, during, this, time, period, was, very, high, even, though, jews, were, estimated, to, account, for, only, 1, of, the, population, of, germany, the, overrepresentation, of, jews, in, these, areas, fuelled, resentment, among, non, jewish, germans, during, periods, of, economic, crisis, the, 1873, stock, market, crash, and, the, ensuing, depression, resulted, in, a, spate, of, attacks, on, alleged, jewish, economic, dominance, in, germany, and, antisemitism, increased, during, this, time, period, in, the, 1870s, german, v, lkisch, nationalism, began, to, adopt, antisemitic, and, racist, themes, and, it, was, also, adopted, by, a, number, of, radical, right, political, movements, radical, antisemitism, was, promoted, by, prominent, advocates, of, v, lkisch, nationalism, including, eugen, diederichs, paul, de, lagarde, and, julius, langbehn, de, lagarde, called, the, jews, a, bacillus, the, carriers, of, decay, who, pollute, every, national, culture, and, destroy, all, faiths, with, their, materialistic, liberalism, and, he, called, for, the, extermination, of, the, jews, langbehn, called, for, a, war, of, annihilation, against, the, jews, and, his, genocidal, policies, were, later, published, by, the, nazis, and, given, to, soldiers, on, the, front, during, world, war, ii, one, antisemitic, ideologue, of, the, period, friedrich, lange, even, used, the, term, national, socialism, to, describe, his, own, anti, capitalist, take, on, the, v, lkisch, nationalist, template, johann, gottlieb, fichte, accused, jews, in, germany, of, having, been, and, inevitably, of, continuing, to, be, a, state, within, a, state, that, threatened, german, national, unity, fichte, promoted, two, options, in, order, to, address, this, his, first, one, being, the, creation, of, a, jewish, state, in, palestine, so, the, jews, could, be, impelled, to, leave, europe, his, second, option, was, violence, against, jews, and, he, said, that, the, goal, of, the, violence, would, be, to, cut, off, all, their, heads, in, one, night, and, set, new, ones, on, their, shoulders, which, should, not, contain, a, single, jewish, idea, the, protocols, of, the, elders, of, zion, 1912, is, an, antisemitic, forgery, created, by, the, secret, service, of, the, russian, empire, the, okhrana, many, antisemites, believed, it, was, real, and, thus, it, became, widely, popular, after, world, war, i, the, protocols, claimed, that, there, was, a, secret, international, jewish, conspiracy, to, take, over, the, world, hitler, had, been, introduced, to, the, protocols, by, alfred, rosenberg, and, from, 1920, onwards, he, focused, his, attacks, by, claiming, that, judaism, and, marxism, were, directly, connected, that, jews, and, bolsheviks, were, one, and, the, same, and, that, marxism, was, a, jewish, ideology, this, became, known, as, jewish, bolshevism, hitler, believed, that, the, protocols, were, authentic, during, his, life, in, vienna, between, 1907, and, 1913, hitler, became, fervently, anti, slavic, prior, to, the, nazi, ascension, to, power, hitler, often, blamed, moral, degradation, on, rassenschande, racial, defilement, a, way, to, assure, his, followers, of, his, continuing, antisemitism, which, had, been, toned, down, for, popular, consumption, prior, to, the, induction, of, the, nuremberg, race, laws, in, 1935, by, the, nazis, many, german, nationalists, such, as, roland, freisler, strongly, supported, laws, to, ban, rassenschande, between, aryans, and, jews, as, racial, treason, even, before, the, laws, were, officially, passed, the, nazis, banned, sexual, relations, and, marriages, between, party, members, and, jews, party, members, found, guilty, of, rassenschande, were, severely, punished, some, party, members, were, even, sentenced, to, death, the, nazis, claimed, that, bismarck, was, unable, to, complete, german, national, unification, because, jews, had, infiltrated, the, german, parliament, and, they, claimed, that, their, abolition, of, parliament, had, ended, this, obstacle, to, unification, using, the, stab, in, the, back, myth, the, nazis, accused, jews, and, other, populations, who, it, considered, non, german, of, possessing, extra, national, loyalties, thereby, exacerbating, german, antisemitism, about, the, judenfrage, the, jewish, question, the, far, right, political, canard, which, was, popular, when, the, ethnic, v, lkisch, movement, and, its, politics, of, romantic, nationalism, for, establishing, a, gro, deutschland, was, strong, nazism, s, racial, policy, positions, may, have, developed, from, the, views, of, important, biologists, of, the, 19th, century, including, french, biologist, jean, baptiste, lamarck, through, ernst, haeckel, s, idealist, version, of, lamarckism, and, the, father, of, genetics, german, botanist, gregor, mendel, haeckel, s, works, were, later, condemned, by, the, nazis, as, inappropriate, for, national, socialist, formation, and, education, in, the, third, reich, this, may, have, been, because, of, his, monist, atheistic, materialist, philosophy, which, the, nazis, disliked, along, with, his, friendliness, to, jews, opposition, to, militarism, and, support, altruism, with, one, nazi, official, calling, for, them, to, be, banned, unlike, darwinian, theory, lamarckian, theory, officially, ranked, races, in, a, hierarchy, of, evolution, from, apes, while, darwinian, theory, did, not, grade, races, in, a, hierarchy, of, higher, or, lower, evolution, from, apes, but, simply, stated, that, all, humans, as, a, whole, had, progressed, in, their, evolution, from, apes, many, lamarckians, viewed, lower, races, as, having, been, exposed, to, debilitating, conditions, for, too, long, for, any, significant, improvement, of, their, condition, to, take, place, in, the, near, future, haeckel, used, lamarckian, theory, to, describe, the, existence, of, interracial, struggle, and, put, races, on, a, hierarchy, of, evolution, ranging, from, wholly, human, to, subhuman, mendelian, inheritance, or, mendelism, was, supported, by, the, nazis, as, well, as, by, mainstream, eugenicists, of, the, time, the, mendelian, theory, of, inheritance, declared, that, genetic, traits, and, attributes, were, passed, from, one, generation, to, another, eugenicists, used, mendelian, inheritance, theory, to, demonstrate, the, transfer, of, biological, illness, and, impairments, from, parents, to, children, including, mental, disability, whereas, others, also, used, mendelian, theory, to, demonstrate, the, inheritance, of, social, traits, with, racialists, claiming, a, racial, nature, behind, certain, general, traits, such, as, inventiveness, or, criminal, behaviour, hitler, and, other, nazi, legal, theorists, were, inspired, by, america, s, institutional, racism, and, saw, it, as, the, model, to, follow, in, particular, they, saw, it, as, a, model, for, the, expansion, of, territory, and, the, elimination, of, indigenous, inhabitants, therefrom, for, laws, denying, full, citizenship, for, african, americans, which, they, wanted, to, implement, also, against, jews, and, for, racist, immigration, laws, banning, some, races, in, mein, kampf, hitler, extolled, america, as, the, only, contemporary, example, of, a, country, with, racist, v, lkisch, citizenship, statutes, in, the, 1920s, and, nazi, lawyers, made, use, of, the, american, models, in, crafting, laws, for, nazi, germany, u, s, citizenship, laws, and, anti, miscegenation, laws, directly, inspired, the, two, principal, nuremberg, laws, the, citizenship, law, and, the, blood, law, during, world, war, i, german, sociologist, johann, plenge, spoke, of, the, rise, of, a, national, socialism, in, germany, within, what, he, termed, the, ideas, of, 1914, that, were, a, declaration, of, war, against, the, ideas, of, 1789, the, french, revolution, according, to, plenge, the, ideas, of, 1789, which, included, the, rights, of, man, democracy, individualism, and, liberalism, were, being, rejected, in, favour, of, the, ideas, of, 1914, which, included, the, german, values, of, duty, discipline, law, and, order, plenge, believed, that, ethnic, solidarity, volksgemeinschaft, would, replace, class, division, and, that, racial, comrades, would, unite, to, create, a, socialist, society, in, the, struggle, of, proletarian, germany, against, capitalist, britain, he, believed, that, the, spirit, of, 1914, manifested, itself, in, the, concept, of, the, people, s, league, of, national, socialism, this, national, socialism, was, a, form, of, state, socialism, that, rejected, the, idea, of, boundless, freedom, and, promoted, an, economy, that, would, serve, the, whole, of, germany, under, the, leadership, of, the, state, this, national, socialism, was, opposed, to, capitalism, due, to, the, components, that, were, against, the, national, interest, of, germany, but, insisted, that, national, socialism, would, strive, for, greater, efficiency, in, the, economy, plenge, advocated, an, authoritarian, rational, ruling, elite, to, develop, national, socialism, through, a, hierarchical, technocratic, state, and, his, ideas, were, part, of, the, basis, of, nazism, oswald, spengler, a, german, cultural, philosopher, was, a, major, influence, on, nazism, although, after, 1933, he, became, alienated, from, nazism, and, was, later, condemned, by, the, nazis, for, criticising, adolf, hitler, spengler, s, conception, of, national, socialism, and, a, number, of, his, political, views, were, shared, by, the, nazis, and, the, conservative, revolutionary, movement, spengler, s, views, were, also, popular, amongst, italian, fascists, including, benito, mussolini, spengler, s, book, the, decline, of, the, west, 1918, written, during, the, final, months, of, world, war, i, addressed, the, supposed, decadence, of, modern, european, civilisation, which, he, claimed, was, caused, by, atomising, and, irreligious, individualisation, and, cosmopolitanism, spengler, s, major, thesis, was, that, a, law, of, historical, development, of, cultures, existed, involving, a, cycle, of, birth, maturity, ageing, and, death, when, it, reaches, its, final, form, of, civilisation, upon, reaching, the, point, of, civilisation, a, culture, will, lose, its, creative, capacity, and, succumb, to, decadence, until, the, emergence, of, barbarians, creates, a, new, epoch, spengler, considered, the, western, world, as, having, succumbed, to, decadence, of, intellect, money, cosmopolitan, urban, life, irreligious, life, atomised, individualisation, and, believed, that, it, was, at, the, end, of, its, biological, and, spiritual, fertility, he, believed, that, the, young, german, nation, as, an, imperial, power, would, inherit, the, legacy, of, ancient, rome, lead, a, restoration, of, value, in, blood, and, instinct, while, the, ideals, of, rationalism, would, be, revealed, as, absurd, spengler, s, notions, of, prussian, socialism, as, described, in, his, book, preussentum, und, sozialismus, prussiandom, and, socialism, 1919, influenced, nazism, and, the, conservative, revolutionary, movement, spengler, wrote, the, meaning, of, socialism, is, that, life, is, controlled, not, by, the, opposition, between, rich, and, poor, but, by, the, rank, that, achievement, and, talent, bestow, that, is, our, freedom, freedom, from, the, economic, despotism, of, the, individual, spengler, adopted, the, anti, english, ideas, addressed, by, plenge, and, sombart, during, world, war, i, that, condemned, english, liberalism, and, english, parliamentarianism, while, advocating, a, national, socialism, that, was, free, from, marxism, and, that, would, connect, the, individual, to, the, state, through, corporatist, organisation, spengler, claimed, that, socialistic, prussian, characteristics, existed, across, germany, including, creativity, discipline, concern, for, the, greater, good, productivity, and, self, sacrifice, he, prescribed, war, as, a, necessity, by, saying, war, is, the, eternal, form, of, higher, human, existence, and, states, exist, for, war, they, are, the, expression, of, the, will, to, war, spengler, s, definition, of, socialism, did, not, advocate, a, change, to, property, relations, he, denounced, marxism, for, seeking, to, train, the, proletariat, to, expropriate, the, expropriator, the, capitalist, and, then, to, let, them, live, a, life, of, leisure, on, this, expropriation, he, claimed, that, marxism, is, the, capitalism, of, the, working, class, and, not, true, socialism, according, to, spengler, true, socialism, would, be, in, the, form, of, corporatism, stating, that, local, corporate, bodies, organised, according, to, the, importance, of, each, occupation, to, the, people, as, a, whole, higher, representation, in, stages, up, to, a, supreme, council, of, the, state, mandates, revocable, at, any, time, no, organised, parties, no, professional, politicians, no, periodic, elections, wilhelm, stapel, an, antisemitic, german, intellectual, used, spengler, s, thesis, on, the, cultural, confrontation, between, jews, as, whom, spengler, described, as, a, magian, people, versus, europeans, as, a, faustian, people, stapel, described, jews, as, a, landless, nomadic, people, in, pursuit, of, an, international, culture, whereby, they, can, integrate, into, western, civilisation, as, such, stapel, claims, that, jews, have, been, attracted, to, international, versions, of, socialism, pacifism, or, capitalism, because, as, a, landless, people, the, jews, have, transgressed, various, national, cultural, boundaries, for, all, of, spengler, s, influence, on, the, movement, he, was, opposed, to, its, antisemitism, he, wrote, in, his, personal, papers, ow, much, envy, of, the, capability, of, other, people, in, view, of, one, s, lack, of, it, lies, hidden, in, anti, semitism, as, well, as, hen, one, would, rather, destroy, business, and, scholarship, than, see, jews, in, them, one, is, an, ideologue, i, e, a, danger, for, the, nation, idiotic, arthur, moeller, van, den, bruck, was, initially, the, dominant, figure, of, the, conservative, revolutionaries, influenced, nazism, he, rejected, reactionary, conservatism, while, proposing, a, new, state, that, he, coined, the, third, reich, which, would, unite, all, classes, under, authoritarian, rule, van, den, bruck, advocated, a, combination, of, the, nationalism, of, the, right, and, the, socialism, of, the, left, fascism, was, a, major, influence, on, nazism, the, seizure, of, power, by, italian, fascist, leader, benito, mussolini, in, the, march, on, rome, in, 1922, drew, admiration, by, hitler, who, less, than, a, month, later, had, begun, to, model, himself, and, the, nazi, party, upon, mussolini, and, the, fascists, hitler, presented, the, nazis, as, a, form, of, german, fascism, in, november, 1923, the, nazis, attempted, a, march, on, berlin, modelled, after, the, march, on, rome, which, resulted, in, the, failed, beer, hall, putsch, in, munich, hitler, spoke, of, nazism, being, indebted, to, the, success, of, fascism, s, rise, to, power, in, italy, in, a, private, conversation, in, 1941, hitler, said, that, the, brown, shirt, would, probably, not, have, existed, without, the, black, shirt, the, brown, shirt, referring, to, the, nazi, militia, and, the, black, shirt, referring, to, the, fascist, militia, he, also, said, in, regards, to, the, 1920s, if, mussolini, had, been, outdistanced, by, marxism, i, don, t, know, whether, we, could, have, succeeded, in, holding, out, at, that, period, national, socialism, was, a, very, fragile, growth, other, nazis, especially, those, at, the, time, associated, with, the, party, s, more, radical, wing, such, as, gregor, strasser, joseph, goebbels, and, heinrich, himmler, rejected, italian, fascism, accusing, it, of, being, too, conservative, or, capitalist, alfred, rosenberg, condemned, italian, fascism, for, being, racially, confused, and, having, influences, from, philosemitism, strasser, criticised, the, policy, of, f, hrerprinzip, as, being, created, by, mussolini, and, considered, its, presence, in, nazism, as, a, foreign, imported, idea, throughout, the, relationship, between, nazi, germany, and, fascist, italy, a, number, of, lower, ranking, nazis, scornfully, viewed, fascism, as, a, conservative, movement, that, lacked, a, full, revolutionary, potential, in, his, book, the, hitler, state, der, staat, hitlers, historian, martin, broszat, writes, national, socialism, was, not, primarily, an, ideological, and, programmatic, but, a, charismatic, movement, whose, ideology, was, incorporated, in, the, f, hrer, hitler, and, which, would, have, lost, all, its, power, to, integrate, without, him, he, abstract, utopian, and, vague, national, socialistic, ideology, only, achieved, what, reality, and, certainty, it, had, through, the, medium, of, hitler, thus, any, explication, of, the, ideology, of, nazism, must, be, descriptive, as, it, was, not, generated, primarily, from, first, principles, but, was, the, result, of, numerous, factors, including, hitler, s, strongly, held, personal, views, some, parts, of, the, 25, point, plan, the, general, goals, of, the, v, lkische, and, nationalist, movements, and, the, conflicts, between, nazi, party, functionaries, who, battled, to, win, over, to, their, respective, interpretations, of, once, the, party, had, been, purged, of, divergant, influences, such, as, strasserism, hitler, was, accepted, by, the, party, s, leadership, as, the, supreme, authority, to, rule, on, ideological, matters, nazi, ideology, was, based, on, a, bio, geo, political, weltanschauung, worldview, advocating, territorial, expansionism, to, cultivate, what, it, viewed, as, a, purified, and, homogeneous, aryan, population, nazi, regime, s, policies, were, shaped, by, the, integration, of, biopolitics, and, geopolitics, within, the, hitlerian, worldview, amalgamating, spatial, theory, practice, and, imagination, with, biopolitics, in, hitlerism, the, concepts, of, space, and, race, were, not, separate, but, existed, in, tension, forming, a, distinct, bio, geo, political, framework, at, the, core, of, the, nazi, project, this, ideology, viewed, german, territorial, conquests, and, extermination, of, those, ethnic, groups, it, dehumanised, as, untermensch, as, part, of, a, biopolitical, process, to, establish, an, ideal, german, community, nazism, emphasised, german, nationalism, including, both, irredentism, and, expansionism, nazism, held, racial, theories, based, upon, a, belief, in, the, existence, of, an, aryan, master, race, that, was, superior, to, all, other, races, the, nazis, emphasised, the, existence, of, racial, conflict, between, the, aryan, race, and, others, particularly, jews, whom, the, nazis, viewed, as, a, mixed, race, that, had, infiltrated, multiple, societies, and, was, responsible, for, exploitation, and, repression, of, the, aryan, race, the, nazis, also, categorised, slavs, as, untermensch, sub, human, wolfgang, bialas, argues, that, the, nazis, sense, of, morality, could, be, described, as, a, form, of, procedural, virtue, ethics, as, it, demanded, unconditional, obedience, to, absolute, virtues, with, the, attitude, of, social, engineering, and, replaced, common, sense, intuitions, with, an, ideological, catalogue, of, virtues, and, commands, the, ideal, nazi, new, man, was, to, be, race, conscious, and, an, ideologically, dedicated, warrior, who, would, commit, actions, for, the, sake, of, the, german, race, while, at, the, same, time, convinced, he, was, doing, the, right, thing, and, acting, morally, the, nazis, believed, an, individual, could, only, develop, their, capabilities, and, individual, characteristics, within, the, framework, of, the, individual, s, racial, membership, the, race, one, belonged, to, determined, whether, or, not, one,

struggle, for, existence, were, declared, by, the, nazis, to, be, the, most, divine, laws, peoples, and, individuals, deemed, inferior, were, said, to, be, incapable, of, surviving, without, those, deemed, superior, yet, by, doing, so, they, imposed, a, burden, on, the, superior, natural, selection, was, deemed, to, favour, the, strong, over, the, weak, and, the, nazis, deemed, that, protecting, those, declared, inferior, was, preventing, nature, from, taking, its, course, those, incapable, of, asserting, themselves, were, viewed, as, doomed, to, annihilation, with, the, right, to, life, being, granted, only, to, those, who, could, survive, on, their, own, at, the, core, of, the, nazi, ideology, was, the, bio, geo, political, project, to, acquire, lebensraum, living, space, through, territorial, conquests, the, german, nazi, party, supported, german, irredentist, claims, to, austria, alsace, lorraine, the, region, of, sudetenland, and, the, territory, known, since, 1919, as, the, polish, corridor, a, major, policy, of, the, german, nazi, party, was, lebensraum, for, the, german, nation, based, on, claims, that, germany, after, world, war, i, was, facing, an, overpopulation, crisis, and, that, expansion, was, needed, to, end, the, country, s, overpopulation, within, existing, confined, territory, and, provide, resources, necessary, to, its, people, s, well, being, since, the, 1920s, the, nazi, party, publicly, promoted, the, expansion, of, germany, into, territories, held, by, the, soviet, union, in, mein, kampf, hitler, stated, that, lebensraum, would, be, acquired, in, eastern, europe, especially, russia, in, his, early, years, as, the, nazi, leader, hitler, had, claimed, that, he, would, be, willing, to, accept, friendly, relations, with, russia, on, the, tactical, condition, that, russia, agree, to, return, to, the, borders, established, by, the, german, russian, peace, agreement, of, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, signed, by, grigori, sokolnikov, of, the, russian, soviet, republic, in, 1918, which, gave, large, territories, held, by, russia, to, german, control, in, exchange, for, peace, in, 1921, hitler, had, commended, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, as, opening, the, possibility, for, restoration, of, relations, between, germany, and, russia, by, saying, through, the, peace, with, russia, the, sustenance, of, germany, as, well, as, the, provision, of, work, were, to, have, been, secured, by, the, acquisition, of, land, and, soil, by, access, to, raw, materials, and, by, friendly, relations, between, the, two, lands, from, 1921, to, 1922, hitler, evoked, rhetoric, of, both, the, achievement, of, lebensraum, involving, the, acceptance, of, a, territorially, reduced, russia, as, well, as, supporting, russian, nationalists, in, overthrowing, the, bolsheviks, and, establishing, a, new, white, russian, government, hitler, s, attitudes, changed, by, the, end, of, 1922, in, which, he, then, supported, an, alliance, of, germany, with, britain, to, destroy, russia, hitler, later, declared, how, far, he, intended, to, expand, germany, into, russia, asia, what, a, disquieting, reservoir, of, men, the, safety, of, europe, will, not, be, assured, until, we, have, driven, asia, back, behind, the, urals, no, organized, russian, state, must, be, allowed, to, exist, west, of, that, line, for, the, future, of, the, german, nation, the, 1914, frontiers, are, of, no, significance, they, did, not, serve, to, protect, us, in, the, past, nor, do, they, offer, any, guarantee, for, our, defence, in, the, future, with, these, frontiers, the, german, people, cannot, maintain, themselves, as, a, compact, unit, nor, can, they, be, assured, of, their, maintenance, against, all, this, we, national, socialists, must, stick, firmly, to, the, aim, that, we, have, set, for, our, foreign, policy, namely, that, the, german, people, must, be, assured, the, territorial, area, which, is, necessary, for, it, to, exist, on, this, earth, the, right, to, territory, may, become, a, duty, when, a, great, nation, seems, destined, to, go, under, unless, its, territory, be, extended, and, that, is, particularly, true, when, the, nation, in, question, is, not, some, little, group, of, negro, people, but, the, germanic, mother, of, all, the, life, which, has, given, cultural, shape, to, the, modern, world, adolf, hitler, mein, kampf, volume, 2, chapter, 14, germany, s, policy, in, eastern, europe, policy, for, lebensraum, planned, mass, expansion, of, germany, s, borders, to, eastwards, of, the, ural, mountains, hitler, planned, for, the, surplus, russian, population, living, west, of, the, urals, to, be, deported, to, the, east, of, the, urals, historian, adam, tooze, explains, that, hitler, believed, that, lebensraum, was, vital, to, securing, american, style, consumer, affluence, for, the, german, people, in, this, light, tooze, argues, that, the, view, that, the, regime, faced, a, guns, or, butter, contrast, is, mistaken, while, it, is, true, that, resources, were, diverted, from, civilian, consumption, to, military, production, tooze, explains, that, at, a, strategic, level, guns, were, ultimately, viewed, as, a, means, to, obtaining, more, butter, while, the, nazi, pre, occupation, with, agrarian, living, and, food, production, are, often, seen, as, a, sign, of, their, backwardness, tooze, explains, this, was, in, fact, a, major, driving, issue, in, european, society, for, at, least, the, last, two, centuries, the, issue, of, how, european, societies, should, respond, to, the, new, global, economy, in, food, was, one, of, the, major, issues, facing, europe, in, the, early, 20th, century, agrarian, life, in, europe, except, perhaps, with, the, exception, of, britain, was, incredibly, common, in, the, early, 1930s, over, 9, million, germans, almost, a, third, of, the, work, force, were, still, working, in, agriculture, and, many, people, not, working, in, agriculture, still, had, small, allotments, or, otherwise, grew, their, own, food, tooze, estimates, that, just, over, half, the, german, population, in, the, 1930s, was, living, in, towns, and, villages, with, populations, under, 20, 000, people, many, people, in, cities, still, had, memories, of, rural, urban, migration, tooze, thus, explains, that, the, nazis, obsessions, with, agrarianism, were, not, an, atavistic, gloss, on, a, modern, industrial, nation, but, a, consequence, of, the, fact, that, nazism, as, both, an, ideology, and, as, a, movement, was, the, product, of, a, society, still, in, economic, transition, the, nazis, obsession, with, food, production, was, a, consequence, of, the, first, world, war, while, europe, was, able, to, avert, famine, with, international, imports, blockades, brought, the, issue, of, food, security, back, into, european, politics, the, allied, blockade, of, germany, in, and, after, world, war, i, did, not, cause, an, outright, famine, but, chronic, malnutrition, did, kill, an, estimated, 600, 000, people, in, germany, and, austria, the, economic, crises, of, the, interwar, period, meant, that, most, germans, had, memories, of, acute, hunger, thus, tooze, concludes, that, the, nazis, obsession, with, acquiring, land, was, not, a, case, of, turning, back, the, clock, but, more, a, refusal, to, accept, that, the, result, of, the, distribution, of, land, resources, and, population, which, had, resulted, from, the, imperialist, wars, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, should, be, accepted, as, final, while, the, victors, of, the, first, world, war, had, either, suitable, agricultural, land, to, population, ratios, or, large, empires, or, both, allowing, them, to, declare, the, issue, of, living, space, closed, the, nazis, knowing, germany, lacked, either, of, these, refused, to, accept, that, germany, s, place, in, the, world, was, to, be, a, medium, sized, workshop, dependent, upon, imported, food, according, to, goebbels, the, conquest, of, lebensraum, was, intended, as, an, initial, step, towards, the, final, goal, of, nazi, ideology, which, was, the, establishment, of, complete, german, global, hegemony, rudolf, hess, relayed, to, walter, hewel, hitler, s, belief, that, world, peace, could, only, be, acquired, when, one, power, the, racially, best, one, has, attained, uncontested, supremacy, when, this, control, would, be, achieved, this, power, could, then, set, up, for, itself, a, world, police, and, assure, itself, the, necessary, living, space, the, lower, races, will, have, to, restrict, themselves, accordingly, in, its, racial, categorisation, nazism, viewed, what, it, called, the, aryan, race, as, the, master, race, of, the, world, a, race, that, was, superior, to, all, other, races, it, viewed, aryans, as, being, in, racial, conflict, with, a, mixed, race, people, the, jews, whom, the, nazis, identified, as, a, dangerous, enemy, of, the, aryans, it, also, viewed, a, number, of, other, peoples, as, dangerous, to, the, well, being, of, the, aryan, race, in, order, to, preserve, the, perceived, racial, purity, of, the, aryan, race, a, set, of, race, laws, was, introduced, in, 1935, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, nuremberg, laws, at, first, these, laws, only, prevented, sexual, relations, and, marriages, between, germans, and, jews, but, they, were, later, extended, to, the, gypsies, negroes, and, their, bastard, offspring, who, were, described, by, the, nazis, as, people, of, alien, blood, such, relations, between, aryans, cf, aryan, certificate, and, non, aryans, were, now, punishable, under, the, race, laws, as, rassenschande, or, race, defilement, after, the, war, began, the, race, defilement, law, was, extended, to, include, all, foreigners, non, germans, at, the, bottom, of, the, racial, scale, of, non, aryans, were, jews, romanis, slavs, and, blacks, to, maintain, the, purity, and, strength, of, the, aryan, race, the, nazis, eventually, sought, to, exterminate, jews, romani, slavs, and, the, physically, and, mentally, disabled, other, groups, deemed, degenerate, and, asocial, who, were, not, targeted, for, extermination, but, were, subjected, to, exclusionary, treatment, by, the, nazi, state, included, homosexuals, blacks, jehovah, s, witnesses, and, political, opponents, one, of, hitler, s, ambitions, at, the, start, of, the, war, was, to, exterminate, expel, or, enslave, most, or, all, slavs, from, central, and, eastern, europe, in, order, to, acquire, living, space, for, german, settlers, a, nazi, era, school, textbook, for, german, students, entitled, heredity, and, racial, biology, for, students, written, by, jakob, graf, described, to, students, the, nazi, conception, of, the, aryan, race, in, a, section, titled, the, aryan, the, creative, force, in, human, history, graf, claimed, that, the, original, aryans, developed, from, nordic, peoples, who, invaded, ancient, india, and, launched, the, initial, development, of, aryan, culture, there, that, later, spread, to, ancient, persia, and, he, claimed, that, the, aryan, presence, in, persia, was, what, was, responsible, for, its, development, into, an, empire, he, claimed, that, ancient, greek, culture, was, developed, by, nordic, peoples, due, to, paintings, of, the, time, which, showed, greeks, who, were, tall, light, skinned, light, eyed, blond, haired, people, he, said, that, the, roman, empire, was, developed, by, the, italics, who, were, related, to, the, celts, who, were, also, a, nordic, people, he, believed, that, the, vanishing, of, the, nordic, component, of, the, populations, in, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, led, to, their, downfall, the, renaissance, was, claimed, to, have, developed, in, the, western, roman, empire, because, of, the, migration, period, that, brought, new, nordic, blood, to, the, empire, s, lands, such, as, the, presence, of, nordic, blood, in, the, lombards, referred, to, as, longobards, in, the, book, that, remnants, of, the, visigoths, were, responsible, for, the, creation, of, the, spanish, empire, and, that, the, heritage, of, the, franks, goths, and, germanic, peoples, in, france, was, what, was, responsible, for, its, rise, as, a, major, power, he, claimed, that, the, rise, of, the, russian, empire, was, due, to, its, leadership, by, people, of, norman, descent, he, described, the, rise, of, anglo, saxon, societies, in, north, america, south, africa, and, australia, as, being, the, result, of, the, nordic, heritage, of, anglo, saxons, he, concluded, these, points, by, saying, everywhere, nordic, creative, power, has, built, mighty, empires, with, high, minded, ideas, and, to, this, very, day, aryan, languages, and, cultural, values, are, spread, over, a, large, part, of, the, world, though, the, creative, nordic, blood, has, long, since, vanished, in, many, places, in, nazi, germany, the, idea, of, creating, a, master, race, resulted, in, efforts, to, purify, the, deutsche, volk, through, eugenics, and, its, culmination, was, the, compulsory, sterilisation, or, the, involuntary, euthanasia, of, physically, or, mentally, disabled, people, after, world, war, ii, the, euthanasia, programme, was, named, action, t4, the, ideological, justification, for, euthanasia, was, hitler, s, view, of, sparta, 11th, century, 195, bc, as, the, original, v, lkisch, state, and, he, praised, sparta, s, dispassionate, destruction, of, congenitally, deformed, infants, in, order, to, maintain, racial, purity, some, non, aryans, enlisted, in, nazi, organisations, like, the, hitler, youth, and, the, wehrmacht, including, germans, of, african, descent, and, jewish, descent, the, nazis, began, to, implement, racial, hygiene, policies, as, soon, as, they, came, to, power, the, july, 1933, law, for, the, prevention, of, hereditarily, diseased, offspring, prescribed, compulsory, sterilisation, for, people, with, a, range, of, conditions, which, were, thought, to, be, hereditary, such, as, schizophrenia, epilepsy, huntington, s, chorea, and, imbecility, sterilization, was, also, mandated, for, chronic, alcoholism, and, other, forms, of, social, deviance, an, estimated, 360, 000, people, were, sterilised, under, this, law, between, 1933, and, 1939, although, some, nazis, suggested, that, the, programme, should, be, extended, to, people, with, physical, disabilities, such, ideas, had, to, be, expressed, carefully, given, the, fact, that, some, nazis, had, physical, disabilities, one, example, being, one, of, the, most, powerful, figures, of, the, regime, joseph, goebbels, who, had, a, deformed, right, leg, nazi, racial, theorist, hans, f, k, g, nther, argued, that, european, peoples, were, divided, into, five, races, nordic, mediterranean, dinaric, alpine, and, east, baltic, g, nther, applied, a, nordicist, conception, in, order, to, justify, his, belief, that, nordics, were, the, highest, in, the, racial, hierarchy, in, his, book, rassenkunde, des, deutschen, volkes, 1922, racial, science, of, the, german, people, g, nther, recognised, germans, as, being, composed, of, all, five, races, but, emphasised, the, strong, nordic, heritage, among, them, hitler, read, rassenkunde, des, deutschen, volkes, which, influenced, his, racial, policy, gunther, believed, that, slavs, belonged, to, an, eastern, race, and, he, warned, against, germans, mixing, with, them, the, nazis, described, jews, as, being, a, racially, mixed, group, of, primarily, near, eastern, and, oriental, racial, types, because, such, racial, groups, were, concentrated, outside, europe, the, nazis, claimed, that, jews, were, racially, alien, to, all, european, peoples, and, that, they, did, not, have, deep, racial, roots, in, europe, g, nther, emphasised, jews, near, eastern, racial, heritage, g, nther, identified, the, mass, conversion, of, the, khazars, to, judaism, in, the, 8th, century, as, creating, the, two, major, branches, of, the, jewish, people, those, of, primarily, near, eastern, racial, heritage, became, the, ashkenazi, jews, that, he, called, eastern, jews, while, those, of, primarily, oriental, racial, heritage, became, the, sephardi, jews, that, he, called, southern, jews, g, nther, claimed, that, the, near, eastern, type, was, composed, of, commercially, spirited, and, artful, traders, and, that, the, type, held, strong, psychological, manipulation, skills, which, aided, them, in, trade, he, claimed, that, the, near, eastern, race, had, been, bred, not, so, much, for, the, conquest, and, exploitation, of, nature, as, it, had, been, for, the, conquest, and, exploitation, of, people, g, nther, believed, that, european, peoples, had, a, racially, motivated, aversion, to, peoples, of, near, eastern, racial, origin, and, their, traits, and, as, evidence, of, this, he, showed, multiple, examples, of, depictions, of, satanic, figures, with, near, eastern, physiognomies, in, european, art, hitler, s, conception, of, the, aryan, herrenvolk, aryan, master, race, excluded, the, vast, majority, of, slavs, from, central, and, eastern, europe, i, e, poles, russians, ukrainians, belarusians, etc, they, were, regarded, as, a, race, of, men, not, inclined, to, a, higher, form, of, civilisation, which, was, under, an, instinctive, force, that, reverted, them, back, to, nature, the, nazis, also, regarded, the, slavs, as, having, dangerous, jewish, and, asiatic, meaning, mongol, influences, because, of, this, the, nazis, declared, slavs, to, be, untermenschen, subhumans, nazi, anthropologists, attempted, to, scientifically, prove, the, historical, admixture, of, the, slavs, who, lived, further, east, and, leading, nazi, racial, theorist, hans, g, nther, regarded, the, slavs, as, being, primarily, nordic, centuries, ago, but, he, believed, that, they, had, mixed, with, non, nordic, types, over, time, exceptions, were, made, for, a, small, percentage, of, slavs, who, the, nazis, saw, as, descended, from, german, settlers, and, therefore, fit, to, be, germanised, and, considered, part, of, the, aryan, master, race, hitler, described, slavs, as, a, mass, of, born, slaves, who, feel, the, need, for, a, master, himmler, classified, slavs, as, bestial, untermenschen, and, jews, as, the, decisive, leader, of, the, untermenschen, these, ideas, were, fervently, advocated, through, nazi, propaganda, which, had, a, massive, impact, on, the, indoctrination, of, the, german, population, der, untermenschen, a, racist, brochure, published, by, the, ss, in, 1942, has, been, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, infamous, pieces, of, nazi, anti, slavic, propaganda, the, nazi, notion, of, slavs, as, inferior, served, as, a, legitimisation, of, their, desire, to, create, lebensraum, for, germans, and, other, germanic, people, in, eastern, europe, where, millions, of, germans, and, other, germanic, settlers, would, be, moved, into, once, those, territories, were, conquered, while, the, original, slavic, inhabitants, were, to, be, annihilated, removed, or, enslaved, nazi, germany, s, policy, changed, towards, slavs, in, response, to, military, manpower, shortages, forcing, it, to, allow, slavs, to, serve, in, its, armed, forces, within, the, occupied, territories, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, they, were, considered, subhuman, hitler, declared, that, racial, conflict, against, jews, was, necessary, in, order, to, save, germany, from, suffering, under, them, and, he, dismissed, concerns, that, the, conflict, with, them, was, inhumane, and, unjust, we, may, be, inhumane, but, if, we, rescue, germany, we, have, achieved, the, greatest, deed, in, the, world, we, may, work, injustice, but, if, we, rescue, germany, then, we, have, removed, the, greatest, injustice, in, the, world, we, may, be, immoral, but, if, our, people, is, rescued, we, have, opened, the, way, for, morality, nazi, propagandist, joseph, goebbels, frequently, employed, antisemitic, rhetoric, to, underline, this, view, the, jew, is, the, enemy, and, the, destroyer, of, the, purity, of, blood, the, conscious, destroyer, of, our, race, national, socialist, politics, was, based, on, competition, and, struggle, as, its, organising, principle, and, the, nazis, believed, that, human, life, consisted, of, eternal, struggle, and, competition, and, derived, its, meaning, from, struggle, and, competition, the, nazis, saw, this, eternal, struggle, in, military, terms, and, advocated, a, society, organised, like, an, army, in, order, to, achieve, success, they, promoted, the, idea, of, a, national, racial, people, s, community, volksgemeinschaft, in, order, to, accomplish, the, efficient, prosecution, of, the, struggle, against, other, peoples, and, states, like, an, army, the, volksgemeinschaft, was, meant, to, consist, of, a, hierarchy, of, ranks, or, classes, of, people, some, commanding, and, others, obeying, all, working, together, for, a, common, goal, this, concept, was, rooted, in, the, writings, of, 19th, century, v, lkisch, authors, who, glorified, medieval, german, society, viewing, it, as, a, community, rooted, in, the, land, and, bound, together, by, custom, and, tradition, in, which, there, was, neither, class, conflict, nor, selfish, individualism, the, nazis, concept, of, the, volksgemeinschaft, appealed, to, many, as, it, was, seen, as, it, seemed, at, once, to, affirm, a, commitment, to, a, new, type, of, society, for, the, modern, age, yet, also, offer, protection, from, the, tensions, and, insecurities, of, modernisation, it, would, balance, individual, achievement, with, group, solidarity, and, cooperation, with, competition, stripped, of, its, ideological, overtones, the, nazi, vision, of, modernisation, without, internal, conflict, and, a, political, community, that, offered, both, security, and, opportunity, was, so, potent, a, vision, of, the, future, that, many, germans, were, willing, to, overlook, its, racist, and, anti, semitic, essence, nazism, rejected, the, marxist, concept, of, class, conflict, and, it, praised, both, german, capitalists, and, german, workers, as, essential, to, the, volksgemeinschaft, in, the, volksgemeinschaft, social, classes, would, continue, to, exist, but, there, would, be, no, class, conflict, between, them, hitler, said, that, the, capitalists, have, worked, their, way, to, the, top, through, their, capacity, and, as, the, basis, of, this, selection, which, again, only, proves, their, higher, race, they, have, a, right, to, lead, german, business, leaders, co, operated, with, the, nazis, during, their, rise, to, power, and, received, substantial, benefits, from, the, nazi, state, after, it, was, established, including, high, profits, and, state, sanctioned, monopolies, and, cartels, large, celebrations, and, symbolism, were, used, extensively, to, encourage, those, engaged, in, physical, labour, on, behalf, of, germany, with, leading, national, socialists, often, praising, the, honour, of, labour, which, fostered, a, sense, of, community, gemeinschaft, for, the, german, people, and, promoted, solidarity, towards, the, nazi, cause, to, win, workers, away, from, marxism, nazi, propaganda, sometimes, presented, its, expansionist, foreign, policy, goals, as, a, class, struggle, between, nations, bonfires, were, made, of, school, children, s, differently, coloured, caps, as, symbolic, of, the, unity, of, different, social, classes, in, 1922, hitler, disparaged, other, nationalist, and, racialist, political, parties, as, disconnected, from, the, mass, populace, especially, lower, and, working, class, young, people, the, racialists, were, not, capable, of, drawing, the, practical, conclusions, from, correct, theoretical, judgements, especially, in, the, jewish, question, in, this, way, the, german, racialist, movement, developed, a, similar, pattern, to, that, of, the, 1880s, and, 1890s, as, in, those, days, its, leadership, gradually, fell, into, the, hands, of, highly, honourable, but, fantastically, na, ve, men, of, learning, professors, district, counsellors, schoolmasters, and, lawyers, in, short, a, bourgeois, idealistic, and, refined, class, it, lacked, the, warm, breath, of, the, nation, s, youthful, vigour, nevertheless, the, nazi, party, s, voter, base, consisted, mainly, of, farmers, and, the, middle, class, including, groups, such, as, weimar, government, officials, school, teachers, doctors, clerks, self, employed, businessmen, salesmen, retired, officers, engineers, and, students, their, demands, included, lower, taxes, higher, prices, for, food, restrictions, on, department, stores, and, consumer, co, operatives, and, reductions, in, social, services, and, wages, the, need, to, maintain, the, support, of, these, groups, made, it, difficult, for, the, nazis, to, appeal, to, the, working, class, since, the, working, class, often, had, opposite, demands, from, 1928, onward, the, nazi, party, s, growth, into, a, large, national, political, movement, was, dependent, on, middle, class, support, and, on, the, public, perception, that, it, promised, to, side, with, the, middle, classes, and, to, confront, the, economic, and, political, power, of, the, working, class, the, financial, collapse, of, the, white, collar, middle, class, of, the, 1920s, figures, much, in, their, strong, support, of, nazism, although, the, nazis, continued, to, make, appeals, to, the, german, worker, historian, timothy, mason, concludes, that, hitler, had, nothing, but, slogans, to, offer, the, working, class, historians, conan, fischer, and, detlef, m, hlberger, argue, that, while, the, nazis, were, primarily, rooted, in, the, lower, middle, class, they, were, able, to, appeal, to, all, classes, in, society, and, that, while, workers, were, generally, underrepresented, they, were, still, a, substantial, source, of, support, for, the, nazis, h, l, ansbacher, argues, that, the, working, class, soldiers, had, the, most, faith, in, hitler, out, of, any, occupational, group, in, germany, the, nazis, also, established, a, norm, that, every, worker, should, be, semi, skilled, which, was, not, simply, rhetorical, the, number, of, men, leaving, school, to, enter, the, work, force, as, unskilled, labourers, fell, from, 200, 000, in, 1934, to, 30, 000, in, 1939, for, many, working, class, families, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, were, a, time, of, social, mobility, not, in, the, sense, of, moving, into, the, middle, class, but, rather, moving, within, the, blue, collar, skill, hierarchy, overall, the, experience, of, workers, varied, considerably, under, nazism, workers, wages, did, not, increase, much, during, nazi, rule, as, the, government, feared, wage, price, inflation, and, thus, wage, growth, was, limited, prices, for, food, and, clothing, rose, though, costs, for, heating, rent, and, light, decreased, skilled, workers, were, in, shortage, from, 1936, onward, meaning, that, workers, who, engaged, in, vocational, training, could, look, forward, to, considerably, higher, wages, benefits, provided, by, the, labour, front, were, generally, positively, received, even, if, workers, did, not, always, buy, in, to, propaganda, about, the, volksgemeinschaft, workers, welcomed, opportunities, for, employment, after, the, harsh, years, of, the, great, depression, creating, a, common, belief, that, the, nazis, had, removed, the, insecurity, of, unemployment, workers, who, remained, discontented, risked, the, gestapo, s, informants, ultimately, the, nazis, faced, a, conflict, between, their, rearmament, program, which, by, necessity, would, require, material, sacrifices, from, workers, longer, hours, and, a, lower, standard, of, living, versus, a, need, to, maintain, the, confidence, of, the, working, class, in, the, regime, hitler, was, sympathetic, to, the, view, that, stressed, taking, further, measures, for, rearmament, but, he, did, not, fully, implement, the, measures, required, for, it, in, order, to, avoid, alienating, the, working, class, while, the, nazis, had, substantial, support, amongst, the, middle, class, they, often, attacked, traditional, middle, class, values, and, hitler, personally, held, great, contempt, for, them, this, was, because, the, traditional, image, of, the, middle, class, was, one, that, was, obsessed, with, personal, status, material, attainment, and, quiet, comfortable, living, which, was, in, opposition, to, the, nazism, s, ideal, of, a, new, man, the, nazis, new, man, was, envisioned, as, a, heroic, figure, who, rejected, a, materialistic, and, private, life, for, a, public, life, and, a, pervasive, sense, of, duty, willing, to, sacrifice, everything, for, the, nation, despite, the, nazis, contempt, for, these, values, they, were, still, able, to, secure, millions, of, middle, class, votes, hermann, beck, argues, that, while, some, members, of, the, middle, class, dismissed, this, as, mere, rhetoric, many, others, in, some, ways, agreed, with, the, nazis, the, defeat, of, 1918, and, the, failures, of, the, weimar, period, caused, many, middle, class, germans, to, question, their, own, identity, thinking, their, traditional, values, to, be, anachronisms, and, agreeing, with, the, nazis, that, these, values, were, no, longer, viable, while, this, rhetoric, would, become, less, frequent, after, 1933, due, to, the, increased, emphasis, on, the, volksgemeinschaft, it, and, its, ideas, would, never, truly, disappear, until, the, overthrow, of, the, regime, the, nazis, instead, emphasised, that, the, middle, class, must, become, staatsb, rger, a, publicly, active, and, involved, citizen, rather, than, a, selfish, materialistic, spie, b, rger, who, was, only, interested, in, private, life, nazi, ideology, advocated, excluding, women, from, political, involvement, and, confining, them, to, the, spheres, of, kinder, k, che, kirche, children, kitchen, church, many, women, enthusiastically, supported, the, regime, but, formed, their, own, internal, hierarchies, hitler, s, own, opinion, on, the, matter, of, women, in, nazi, germany, was, that, while, other, eras, of, german, history, had, experienced, the, development, and, liberation, of, the, female, mind, the, national, socialist, goal, was, essentially, singular, in, that, it, wished, for, them, to, produce, a, child, based, on, this, theme, hitler, once, remarked, about, women, that, with, every, child, that, she, brings, into, the, world, she, fights, her, battle, for, the, nation, the, man, stands, up, for, the, volk, exactly, as, the, woman, stands, up, for, the, family, proto, natalist, programs, in, nazi, germany, offered, favourable, loans, and, grants, to, newlyweds, and, encouraged, them, to, give, birth, to, offspring, by, providing, them, with, additional, incentives, contraception, was, discouraged, for, racially, valuable, women, in, nazi, germany, and, abortion, was, forbidden, by, strict, legal, mandates, including, prison, sentences, for, women, who, sought, them, as, well, as, prison, sentences, for, doctors, who, performed, them, whereas, abortion, for, racially, undesirable, persons, was, encouraged, while, unmarried, until, the, very, end, of, the, regime, hitler, often, made, excuses, about, his, busy, life, hindering, any, chance, for, marriage, among, national, socialist, ideologues, marriage, was, valued, not, for, moral, considerations, but, because, it, provided, an, optimal, breeding, environment, reichsf, hrer, ss, heinrich, himmler, reportedly, told, a, confidant, that, when, he, established, the, lebensborn, program, an, organisation, that, would, dramatically, increase, the, birth, rate, of, aryan, children, through, extramarital, relations, between, women, classified, as, racially, pure, and, their, male, equals, he, had, only, the, purest, male, conception, assistants, in, mind, since, the, nazis, extended, the, rassenschande, race, defilement, law, to, all, foreigners, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, pamphlets, were, issued, to, german, women, which, ordered, them, to, avoid, sexual, relations, with, foreign, workers, who, were, brought, to, germany, and, the, pamphlets, also, ordered, german, women, to, view, these, same, foreign, workers, as, a, danger, to, their, blood, although, the, law, was, applicable, to, both, genders, german, women, were, punished, more, severely, for, having, sexual, relations, with, foreign, forced, labourers, in, germany, the, nazis, issued, the, polish, decrees, on, 8, march, 1940, which, contained, regulations, concerning, the, polish, forced, labourers, zivilarbeiter, who, were, brought, to, germany, during, world, war, ii, one, of, the, regulations, stated, that, any, pole, who, has, sexual, relations, with, a, german, man, or, woman, or, approaches, them, in, any, other, improper, manner, will, be, punished, by, death, after, the, decrees, were, enacted, himmler, stated, fellow, germans, who, engage, in, sexual, relations, with, male, or, female, civil, workers, of, the, polish, nationality, commit, other, immoral, acts, or, engage, in, love, affairs, shall, be, arrested, immediately, the, nazis, later, issued, similar, regulations, against, the, eastern, workers, ost, arbeiter, including, the, imposition, of, the, death, penalty, if, they, engaged, in, sexual, relations, with, german, persons, heydrich, issued, a, decree, on, 20, february, 1942, which, declared, that, sexual, intercourse, between, a, german, woman, and, a, russian, worker, or, prisoner, of, war, would, result, in, the, russian, man, being, punished, with, the, death, penalty, another, decree, issued, by, himmler, on, 7, december, 1942, stated, that, any, unauthorised, sexual, intercourse, would, result, in, the, death, penalty, because, the, law, for, the, protection, of, german, blood, and, german, honour, did, not, permit, capital, punishment, for, race, defilement, special, courts, were, convened, in, order, to, allow, the, death, penalty, to, be, imposed, in, some, cases, german, women, accused, of, race, defilement, were, marched, through, the, streets, with, their, head, shaven, and, placards, detailing, their, crimes, were, placed, around, their, necks, and, those, convicted, of, race, defilement, were, sent, to, concentration, camps, when, himmler, reportedly, asked, hitler, what, the, punishment, should, be, for, german, girls, and, german, women, who, were, found, guilty, of, race, defilement, with, prisoners, of, war, pows, he, ordered, that, every, pow, who, has, relations, with, a, german, girl, or, a, german, would, be, shot, and, the, german, woman, should, be, publicly, humiliated, by, having, her, hair, shorn, and, being, sent, to, a, concentration, camp, the, league, of, german, girls, was, particularly, regarded, as, instructing, girls, to, avoid, race, defilement, which, was, treated, with, particular, importance, for, young, females, transgender, people, had, a, variety, of, experiences, depending, on, whether, they, were, considered, aryan, or, capable, of, useful, work, several, historians, have, noted, that, transgender, people, were, targeted, by, the, nazis, through, legislation, and, were, sent, to, concentration, camps, after, the, night, of, the, long, knives, hitler, promoted, himmler, and, the, ss, who, then, zealously, suppressed, homosexuality, by, saying, we, must, exterminate, these, people, root, and, branch, the, homosexual, must, be, eliminated, in, 1936, himmler, established, the, reichszentrale, zur, bek, mpfung, der, homosexualit, t, und, abtreibung, reich, central, office, for, the, combating, of, homosexuality, and, abortion, the, nazi, regime, incarcerated, some, 100, 000, homosexuals, during, the, 1930s, as, concentration, camp, prisoners, homosexual, men, were, forced, to, wear, pink, triangle, badges, nazi, ideology, still, viewed, german, men, who, were, gay, as, a, part, of, the, aryan, master, race, but, the, nazi, regime, attempted, to, force, them, into, sexual, and, social, conformity, homosexuals, were, viewed, as, failing, in, their, duty, to, procreate, and, reproduce, for, the, aryan, nation, gay, men, who, would, not, change, or, feign, a, change, in, their, sexual, orientation, were, sent, to, concentration, camps, under, the, extermination, through, work, campaign, the, nazi, party, programme, of, 1920, guaranteed, freedom, for, all, religious, denominations, which, were, not, hostile, to, the, state, and, it, also, endorsed, positive, christianity, in, order, to, combat, the, jewish, materialist, spirit, positive, christianity, was, a, modified, version, of, christianity, which, emphasised, racial, purity, and, nationalism, the, nazis, were, aided, by, theologians, such, as, ernst, bergmann, in, his, work, die, 25, thesen, der, deutschreligion, twenty, five, points, of, the, german, religion, bergmann, held, the, view, that, the, old, testament, of, the, bible, was, inaccurate, along, with, portions, of, the, new, testament, claimed, that, jesus, was, not, a, jew, but, was, instead, of, aryan, origin, and, he, also, claimed, that, adolf, hitler, was, the, new, messiah, hitler, denounced, the, old, testament, as, satan, s, bible, and, using, components, of, the, new, testament, he, attempted, to, prove, that, jesus, was, both, an, aryan, and, an, antisemite, by, citing, passages, such, as, john, 8, 44, where, he, noted, that, jesus, is, yelling, at, the, jews, as, well, as, saying, to, them, your, father, is, the, devil, and, the, cleansing, of, the, temple, which, describes, jesus, whipping, of, the, children, of, the, devil, hitler, claimed, that, the, new, testament, included, distortions, by, paul, the, apostle, who, hitler, described, as, a, mass, murderer, turned, saint, in, their, propaganda, the, nazis, used, the, writings, of, martin, luther, the, protestant, reformer, they, publicly, displayed, an, original, edition, of, luther, s, on, the, jews, and, their, lies, during, the, annual, nuremberg, rallies, the, nazis, were, initially, very, hostile, to, catholics, because, most, catholics, supported, the, german, centre, party, catholics, opposed, the, nazis, promotion, of, compulsory, sterilisation, of, those, whom, they, deemed, inferior, and, the, catholic, church, forbade, its, members, to, vote, for, the, nazis, in, 1933, extensive, nazi, violence, occurred, against, catholics, due, to, their, association, with, the, centre, party, and, their, opposition, to, the, nazi, regime, s, sterilisation, laws, the, nazis, demanded, that, catholics, declare, their, loyalty, to, the, german, state, in, their, propaganda, the, nazis, used, elements, of, germany, s, catholic, history, in, particular, the, german, catholic, teutonic, knights, and, their, campaigns, in, eastern, europe, the, nazis, identified, them, as, sentinels, in, the, east, against, slavic, chaos, though, beyond, that, symbolism, the, influence, of, the, teutonic, knights, on, nazism, was, limited, hitler, also, admitted, that, the, nazis, night, rallies, were, inspired, by, the, catholic, rituals, which, he, had, witnessed, during, his, catholic, upbringing, the, nazis, did, seek, official, reconciliation, with, the, catholic, church, and, they, endorsed, the, creation, of, the, pro, nazi, catholic, kreuz, und, adler, an, organisation, which, advocated, a, form, of, national, catholicism, that, would, reconcile, the, catholic, church, s, beliefs, with, nazism, on, 20, july, 1933, a, concordat, reichskonkordat, was, signed, between, nazi, germany, and, the, catholic, church, which, in, exchange, for, acceptance, of, the, catholic, church, in, germany, required, german, catholics, to, be, loyal, to, the, german, state, the, catholic, church, then, ended, its, ban, on, members, supporting, the, nazi, party, during, the, second, world, war, and, the, fanaticization, of, national, socialism, priests, and, nuns, increasingly, came, into, the, focus, of, the, gestapo, and, the, ss, in, the, concentration, camps, separate, priestly, blocks, were, formed, and, any, church, resistance, was, strictly, persecuted, the, monastery, sister, maria, restituta, kafka, was, sentenced, to, death, by, the, people, s, court, and, executed, only, for, a, harmless, song, critical, of, the, regime, polish, priests, came, en, masse, to, the, auschwitz, concentration, camp, catholic, resistance, groups, like, those, around, roman, karl, scholz, were, persecuted, uncompromisingly, while, the, catholic, resistance, was, often, anti, war, and, passive, there, are, also, examples, of, actively, combating, national, socialism, the, group, around, the, priest, heinrich, maier, approached, the, american, secret, service, and, provided, them, with, plans, and, location, sketches, of, for, v, 2, rockets, tiger, tanks, messerschmitt, bf, 109, and, messerschmitt, me, 163, komet, and, their, production, sites, so, that, they, could, successfully, bomb, the, factories, after, the, war, their, history, was, often, forgotten, also, because, they, acted, against, the, express, instructions, of, their, church, authorities, historian, michael, burleigh, claims, that, nazism, used, christianity, for, political, purposes, but, such, use, required, that, fundamental, tenets, were, stripped, out, but, the, remaining, diffuse, religious, emotionality, had, its, uses, burleigh, claims, that, nazism, s, conception, of, spirituality, was, self, consciously, pagan, and, primitive, historian, roger, griffin, rejects, the, claim, that, nazism, was, primarily, pagan, noting, that, although, there, were, some, influential, neo, paganists, in, the, nazi, party, such, as, heinrich, himmler, and, alfred, rosenberg, they, represented, a, minority, and, their, views, did, not, influence, nazi, ideology, beyond, its, use, for, symbolism, it, is, noted, that, hitler, denounced, germanic, paganism, in, mein, kampf, and, condemned, rosenberg, s, and, himmler, s, paganism, as, nonsense, the, nazis, came, to, power, in, the, midst, of, great, depression, when, the, unemployment, rate, at, that, point, in, time, was, close, to, 30, generally, speaking, nazi, theorists, and, politicians, blamed, germany, s, previous, economic, failures, on, political, causes, like, the, influence, of, marxism, on, the, workforce, the, sinister, and, exploitative, machinations, of, what, they, called, international, jewry, and, the, vindictiveness, of, the, western, political, leaders, war, reparation, demands, instead, of, traditional, economic, incentives, the, nazis, offered, solutions, of, a, political, nature, such, as, the, elimination, of, organised, trade, unions, rearmament, in, contravention, of, the, versailles, treaty, and, biological, politics, various, work, programs, designed, to, establish, full, employment, for, the, german, population, were, instituted, once, the, nazis, seized, full, national, power, hitler, encouraged, nationally, supported, projects, like, the, construction, of, the, autobahn, highway, system, the, introduction, of, an, affordable, people, s, car, volkswagen, and, later, the, nazis, bolstered, the, economy, through, the, business, and, employment, generated, by, military, rearmament, the, nazis, benefited, early, in, the, regime, s, existence, from, the, first, post, depression, economic, upswing, and, this, combined, with, their, public, works, projects, job, procurement, program, and, subsidised, home, repair, program, reduced, unemployment, by, as, much, as, 40, per, cent, in, one, year, this, development, tempered, the, unfavourable, psychological, climate, caused, by, the, earlier, economic, crisis, and, encouraged, germans, to, march, in, step, with, the, regime, the, economic, policies, of, the, nazis, were, in, many, respects, a, continuation, of, the, policies, of, the, german, national, people, s, party, a, national, conservative, party, and, the, nazis, coalition, partner, while, other, western, capitalist, countries, strove, for, increased, state, ownership, of, industry, during, the, same, period, the, nazis, transferred, public, ownership, into, the, private, sector, and, handed, over, some, public, services, to, private, organizations, mostly, affiliated, with, the, nazi, party, it, was, an, intentional, policy, with, multiple, objectives, rather, than, ideologically, driven, and, was, used, as, a, tool, to, enhance, support, for, the, nazi, government, and, the, party, according, to, historian, richard, overy, the, nazi, war, economy, was, a, mixed, economy, that, combined, free, markets, with, central, planning, and, described, the, economy, as, being, somewhere, in, between, the, command, economy, of, the, soviet, union, and, the, capitalist, system, of, the, united, states, the, nazi, government, continued, the, economic, policies, introduced, by, the, government, of, kurt, von, schleicher, in, 1932, to, combat, the, effects, of, the, depression, upon, being, appointed, chancellor, in, 1933, hitler, appointed, hjalmar, schacht, a, former, member, of, the, german, democratic, party, as, president, of, the, reichsbank, in, 1933, and, minister, of, economics, in, 1934, hitler, promised, measures, to, increase, employment, protect, the, german, currency, and, promote, recovery, from, the, great, depression, these, included, an, agrarian, settlement, program, labour, service, and, a, guarantee, to, maintain, health, care, and, pensions, however, these, policies, and, programs, which, included, a, large, public, works, programs, supported, by, deficit, spending, such, as, the, construction, of, the, autobahn, network, to, stimulate, the, economy, and, reduce, unemployment, were, inherited, and, planned, to, be, undertaken, by, the, weimar, republic, during, conservative, paul, von, hindenburg, s, presidency, and, which, the, nazis, appropriated, as, their, own, after, coming, to, power, above, all, hitler, s, priority, was, rearmament, and, the, buildup, of, the, german, military, in, preparation, for, an, eventual, war, to, conquer, lebensraum, in, the, east, the, policies, of, schacht, created, a, scheme, for, deficit, financing, in, which, capital, projects, were, paid, for, with, the, issuance, of, promissory, notes, called, mefo, bills, which, could, be, traded, by, companies, with, each, other, this, was, particularly, useful, in, allowing, germany, to, rearm, because, the, mefo, bills, were, not, reichsmarks, and, did, not, appear, in, the, federal, budget, so, they, helped, conceal, rearmament, at, the, beginning, of, his, rule, hitler, said, that, the, future, of, germany, depends, exclusively, and, only, on, the, reconstruction, of, the, wehrmacht, all, other, tasks, must, cede, precedence, to, the, task, of, rearmament, this, policy, was, implemented, immediately, with, military, expenditures, quickly, growing, far, larger, than, the, civilian, work, creation, programs, as, early, as, june, 1933, military, spending, for, the, year, was, budgeted, to, be, three, times, larger, than, the, spending, on, all, civilian, work, creation, measures, in, 1932, and, 1933, combined, nazi, germany, increased, its, military, spending, faster, than, any, other, state, in, peacetime, with, the, share, of, military, spending, rising, from, 1, per, cent, to, 10, per, cent, of, national, income, in, the, first, two, years, of, the, regime, alone, eventually, it, reached, as, high, as, 75, per, cent, by, 1944, in, spite, of, their, rhetoric, condemning, big, business, prior, to, their, rise, to, power, the, nazis, quickly, entered, into, a, partnership, with, german, business, from, as, early, as, february, 1933, that, month, after, being, appointed, chancellor, but, before, gaining, dictatorial, powers, hitler, made, a, personal, appeal, to, german, business, leaders, to, help, fund, the, nazi, party, for, the, crucial, months, that, were, to, follow, he, argued, that, they, should, support, him, in, establishing, a, dictatorship, because, private, enterprise, cannot, be, maintained, in, the, age, of, democracy, and, because, democracy, would, allegedly, lead, to, communism, he, promised, to, destroy, the, german, left, and, the, trade, unions, without, any, mention, of, anti, jewish, policies, or, foreign, conquests, in, the, following, weeks, the, nazi, party, received, contributions, from, seventeen, different, business, groups, with, the, largest, coming, from, ig, farben, and, deutsche, bank, historian, adam, tooze, writes, that, the, leaders, of, german, business, were, therefore, willing, partners, in, the, destruction, of, political, pluralism, in, germany, in, exchange, owners, and, managers, of, german, businesses, were, granted, unprecedented, powers, to, control, their, workforce, collective, bargaining, was, abolished, and, wages, were, frozen, at, a, relatively, low, level, business, profits, also, rose, very, rapidly, as, did, corporate, investment, in, addition, the, nazis, privatised, public, properties, and, public, services, only, increasing, economic, state, control, through, regulations, hitler, believed, that, private, ownership, was, useful, in, that, it, encouraged, creative, competition, and, technical, innovation, but, insisted, that, it, had, to, conform, to, national, interests, and, be, productive, rather, than, parasitical, private, property, rights, were, conditional, upon, following, the, economic, priorities, set, by, the, nazi, leadership, with, high, profits, as, a, reward, for, firms, who, followed, them, and, the, threat, of, nationalisation, being, used, against, those, who, did, not, under, nazi, economics, free, competition, and, self, regulating, markets, diminished, but, hitler, s, social, darwinist, beliefs, made, him, retain, business, competition, and, private, property, as, economic, engines, the, nazis, were, hostile, to, the, idea, of, social, welfare, in, principle, upholding, instead, the, social, darwinist, concept, that, the, weak, and, feeble, should, perish, they, condemned, the, welfare, system, of, the, weimar, republic, as, well, as, private, charity, accusing, them, of, supporting, people, regarded, as, racially, inferior, and, weak, who, should, have, been, weeded, out, in, the, process, of, natural, selection, nevertheless, faced, with, the, mass, unemployment, and, poverty, of, the, great, depression, the, nazis, found, it, necessary, to, set, up, charitable, institutions, to, help, racially, pure, germans, in, order, to, maintain, popular, support, while, arguing, that, this, represented, racial, self, help, and, not, indiscriminate, charity, or, universal, social, welfare, nazi, programs, such, as, the, winter, relief, of, the, german, people, and, the, broader, national, socialist, people, s, welfare, nsv, were, organised, as, quasi, private, institutions, officially, relying, on, private, donations, from, germans, to, help, others, of, their, race, although, in, practice, those, who, refused, to, donate, could, face, severe, consequences, unlike, the, social, welfare, institutions, of, the, weimar, republic, and, the, christian, charities, the, nsv, distributed, assistance, on, explicitly, racial, grounds, it, provided, support, only, to, those, who, were, racially, sound, capable, of, and, willing, to, work, politically, reliable, and, willing, and, able, to, reproduce, non, aryans, were, excluded, as, well, as, the, work, shy, asocials, and, the, hereditarily, ill, successful, efforts, were, made, to, get, middle, class, women, involved, in, social, work, assisting, large, families, and, the, winter, relief, campaigns, acted, as, a, ritual, to, generate, public, sympathy, agrarian, policies, were, also, important, to, the, nazis, since, they, corresponded, not, just, to, the, economy, but, to, their, geopolitical, conception, of, lebensraum, as, well, for, hitler, the, acquisition, of, land, and, soil, was, requisite, in, moulding, the, german, economy, to, tie, farmers, to, their, land, selling, agricultural, land, was, prohibited, farm, ownership, remained, private, but, business, monopoly, rights, were, granted, to, marketing, boards, to, control, production, and, prices, with, a, quota, system, the, hereditary, farm, law, of, 1933, established, a, cartel, structure, under, a, government, body, known, as, the, reichsn, hrstand, rnst, which, determined, everything, from, what, seeds, and, fertilizers, were, used, to, how, land, was, inherited, hitler, primarily, viewed, the, german, economy, as, an, instrument, of, power, and, believed, the, economy, was, not, about, creating, wealth, and, technical, progress, so, as, to, improve, the, quality, of, life, for, a, nation, s, citizenry, but, rather, that, economic, success, was, paramount, for, providing, the, means, and, material, foundations, necessary, for, military, conquest, while, economic, progress, generated, by, national, socialist, programs, had, its, role, in, appeasing, the, german, people, the, nazis, and, hitler, in, particular, did, not, believe, that, economic, solutions, alone, were, sufficient, to, thrust, germany, onto, the, stage, as, a, world, power, the, nazis, thus, sought, to, secure, a, general, economic, revival, accompanied, by, massive, military, spending, for, rearmament, especially, later, through, the, implementation, of, the, four, year, plan, which, consolidated, their, rule, and, firmly, secured, a, command, relationship, between, the, german, arms, industry, and, the, national, socialist, government, between, 1933, and, 1939, military, expenditures, were, upwards, of, 82, billion, reichsmarks, and, represented, 23, per, cent, of, germany, s, gross, national, product, as, the, nazis, mobilised, their, people, and, economy, for, war, the, nazis, claimed, that, communism, was, dangerous, to, the, well, being, of, nations, because, of, its, intention, to, dissolve, private, property, its, support, of, class, conflict, its, aggression, against, the, middle, class, its, hostility, towards, small, business, and, its, atheism, nazism, rejected, class, conflict, based, socialism, and, economic, egalitarianism, favouring, instead, a, stratified, economy, with, social, classes, based, on, merit, and, talent, retaining, private, property, and, the, creation, of, national, solidarity, that, transcends, class, distinction, during, the, late, 1930s, and, the, 1940s, anti, communist, regimes, and, groups, that, supported, nazism, included, the, falange, in, francoist, spain, the, vichy, regime, and, the, 33rd, waffen, grenadier, division, of, the, ss, charlemagne, 1st, french, in, france, and, the, british, union, of, fascists, under, oswald, mosley, in, mein, kampf, hitler, stated, his, desire, to, make, war, upon, the, marxist, principle, that, all, men, are, equal, he, believed, that, the, notion, of, equality, was, a, sin, against, nature, nazism, upheld, the, natural, inequality, of, men, including, inequality, between, races, and, also, within, each, race, the, nazi, state, aimed, to, advance, those, individuals, with, special, talents, or, intelligence, so, they, could, rule, over, the, masses, nazi, ideology, relied, on, elitism, and, the, f, hrerprinzip, leadership, principle, arguing, that, elite, minorities, should, assume, leadership, roles, over, the, majority, and, that, the, elite, minority, should, itself, be, organised, according, to, a, hierarchy, of, talent, with, a, single, leader, the, f, hrer, at, the, top, the, f, hrerprinzip, held, that, each, member, of, the, hierarchy, owed, absolute, obedience, to, those, above, him, and, should, hold, absolute, power, over, those, below, him, during, the, 1920s, hitler, urged, disparate, nazi, factions, to, unite, in, opposition, to, jewish, bolshevism, hitler, asserted, that, the, three, vices, of, jewish, marxism, were, democracy, pacifism, and, internationalism, the, communist, movement, the, trade, unions, the, social, democratic, party, and, the, left, wing, press, were, all, considered, to, be, jewish, controlled, and, part, of, the, international, jewish, conspiracy, to, weaken, the, german, nation, by, promoting, internal, disunity, through, class, struggle, the, nazis, also, believed, that, the, jews, had, instigated, the, bolshevik, revolution, in, russia, and, that, communists, had, stabbed, germany, in, the, back, and, caused, it, to, lose, the, first, world, war, they, further, argued, that, modern, cultural, trends, of, the, 1920s, such, as, jazz, music, and, cubist, art, represented, cultural, bolshevism, and, were, part, of, a, political, assault, aimed, at, the, spiritual, degeneration, of, the, german, volk, joseph, goebbels, published, a, pamphlet, titled, the, nazi, sozi, which, gave, brief, points, of, how, nazism, differed, from, marxism, in, 1930, hitler, said, our, adopted, term, socialist, has, nothing, to, do, with, marxist, socialism, marxism, is, anti, property, true, socialism, is, not, the, communist, party, of, germany, kpd, was, the, largest, communist, party, in, the, world, outside, of, the, soviet, union, until, it, was, destroyed, by, the, nazis, in, 1933, in, the, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, communists, and, nazis, often, fought, each, other, directly, in, street, violence, with, the, nazi, paramilitary, organisations, being, opposed, by, the, communist, red, front, and, anti, fascist, action, after, the, beginning, of, the, great, depression, both, communists, and, nazis, saw, their, share, of, the, vote, increase, while, the, nazis, were, willing, to, form, alliances, with, other, parties, of, the, right, the, communists, refused, to, form, an, alliance, with, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, the, largest, party, of, the, left, after, the, nazis, came, to, power, they, quickly, banned, the, communist, party, under, the, allegation, that, it, was, preparing, for, revolution, and, that, it, had, caused, the, reichstag, fire, four, thousand, kpd, officials, were, arrested, in, february, 1933, and, by, the, end, of, the, year, 130, 000, communists, had, been, sent, to, nazi, concentration, camps, the, nazis, argued, that, free, market, capitalism, damages, nations, due, to, international, finance, and, the, worldwide, economic, dominance, of, disloyal, big, business, which, they, considered, to, be, the, product, of, jewish, influences, nazi, propaganda, posters, in, working, class, districts, emphasised, anti, capitalism, such, as, one, that, said, the, maintenance, of, a, rotten, industrial, system, has, nothing, to, do, with, nationalism, i, can, love, germany, and, hate, capitalism, both, in, public, and, in, private, hitler, opposed, free, market, capitalism, because, it, could, not, be, trusted, to, put, national, interests, first, arguing, that, it, holds, nations, ransom, in, the, interests, of, a, parasitic, cosmopolitan, rentier, class, he, believed, that, international, free, trade, would, lead, to, global, domination, by, the, british, empire, and, the, united, states, which, he, believed, were, controlled, by, jewish, bankers, in, wall, street, and, the, city, of, london, in, particular, hitler, saw, the, united, states, as, a, major, future, rival, and, feared, that, the, globalization, after, world, war, i, would, allow, north, america, to, displace, europe, as, the, world, s, most, powerful, continent, hitler, s, anxiety, over, the, economic, rise, of, the, united, states, was, a, major, theme, in, his, unpublished, zweites, buch, he, even, hoped, for, a, time, that, britain, could, be, swayed, into, an, alliance, with, germany, on, the, basis, of, a, shared, economic, rivalry, with, the, united, states, hitler, desired, an, economy, that, would, direct, resources, in, ways, that, matched, the, many, national, goals, of, the, regime, such, as, the, buildup, of, the, military, building, programs, for, cities, and, roads, and, economic, self, sufficiency, hitler, also, distrusted, free, market, capitalism, for, being, unreliable, due, to, its, egotism, and, preferred, a, state, directed, economy, that, maintains, private, property, and, competition, but, subordinates, them, to, the, interests, of, the, volk, and, nation, hitler, told, a, party, leader, in, 1934, the, economic, system, of, our, day, is, the, creation, of, the, jews, hitler, said, to, benito, mussolini, that, capitalism, had, run, its, course, hitler, also, said, that, the, business, bourgeoisie, know, nothing, except, their, profit, fatherland, is, only, a, word, for, them, hitler, was, personally, disgusted, with, the, ruling, bourgeois, elites, of, germany, during, the, period, of, the, weimar, republic, whom, he, referred, to, as, cowardly, shits, in, mein, kampf, hitler, effectively, supported, mercantilism, in, the, belief, that, economic, resources, from, their, respective, territories, should, be, seized, by, force, as, he, believed, that, the, policy, of, lebensraum, would, provide, germany, with, such, economically, valuable, territories, he, argued, that, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, only, benefitted, from, free, trade, because, they, had, already, conquered, substantial, internal, markets, through, british, colonial, conquests, and, american, westward, expansion, hitler, argued, that, the, only, means, to, maintain, economic, security, was, to, have, direct, control, over, resources, rather, than, being, forced, to, rely, on, world, trade, hitler, claimed, that, war, to, gain, such, resources, was, the, only, means, to, surpass, the, failing, capitalist, economic, system, in, practice, however, the, nazis, merely, opposed, one, type, of, capitalism, namely, 19th, century, free, market, capitalism, and, the, laissez, faire, model, which, they, nonetheless, applied, to, the, social, sphere, in, the, form, of, social, darwinism, some, have, described, nazi, germany, as, an, example, of, corporatism, authoritarian, capitalism, or, totalitarian, capitalism, while, claiming, to, strive, for, autarky, in, propaganda, the, nazis, crushed, existing, movements, towards, self, sufficiency, and, established, extensive, capital, connections, in, efforts, to, ready, for, expansionist, war, and, genocide, in, alliance, with, traditional, business, and, commerce, elites, in, spite, of, their, anti, capitalist, rhetoric, in, opposition, to, big, business, the, nazis, allied, with, german, business, as, soon, as, they, got, in, power, by, appealing, to, the, fear, of, communism, and, promising, to, destroy, the, german, left, and, trade, unions, eventually, purging, both, more, radical, and, reactionary, elements, from, the, party, in, 1934, joseph, goebbels, who, would, later, go, on, to, become, the, nazi, propaganda, minister, was, strongly, opposed, to, both, capitalism, and, communism, viewing, them, as, the, two, great, pillars, of, materialism, that, were, part, of, the, international, jewish, conspiracy, for, world, domination, nevertheless, he, wrote, in, his, diary, in, 1925, that, if, he, were, forced, to, choose, between, them, in, the, final, analysis, it, would, be, better, for, us, to, go, down, with, bolshevism, than, live, in, eternal, slavery, under, capitalism, goebbels, also, linked, his, antisemitism, to, his, anti, capitalism, stating, in, a, 1929, pamphlet, that, we, see, in, the, hebrews, the, incarnation, of, capitalism, the, misuse, of, the, nation, s, goods, within, the, nazi, party, the, faction, associated, with, anti, capitalist, beliefs, was, the, sa, a, paramilitary, wing, led, by, ernst, r, hm, the, sa, had, a, complicated, relationship, with, the, rest, of, the, party, giving, both, r, hm, himself, and, local, sa, leaders, significant, autonomy, different, local, leaders, would, even, promote, different, political, ideas, in, their, units, including, nationalistic, socialistic, anti, semitic, racist, v, lkisch, or, conservative, ideas, there, was, tension, between, the, sa, and, hitler, especially, from, 1930, onward, as, hitler, s, increasingly, close, association, with, big, industrial, interests, and, traditional, rightist, forces, caused, many, in, the, sa, to, distrust, him, the, sa, regarded, hitler, s, seizure, of, power, in, 1933, as, a, first, revolution, against, the, left, and, some, voices, within, the, ranks, began, arguing, for, a, second, revolution, against, the, right, after, engaging, in, violence, against, the, left, in, 1933, r, hm, s, sa, also, began, attacks, against, individuals, deemed, to, be, associated, with, conservative, reaction, hitler, saw, r, hm, s, independent, actions, as, violating, and, possibly, threatening, his, leadership, as, well, as, jeopardising, the, regime, by, alienating, the, conservative, president, paul, von, hindenburg, and, the, conservative, oriented, german, army, this, resulted, in, hitler, purging, r, hm, and, other, radical, members, of, the, sa, in, 1934, during, the, night, of, the, long, knives, under, nazism, with, its, emphasis, on, the, nation, individualism, was, denounced, and, instead, importance, was, placed, upon, germans, belonging, to, the, german, volk, and, people, s, community, volksgemeinschaft, hitler, declared, that, every, activity, and, every, need, of, every, individual, will, be, regulated, by, the, collectivity, represented, by, the, party, and, that, there, are, no, longer, any, free, realms, in, which, the, individual, belongs, to, himself, one, of, the, core, objectives, of, the, nazi, party, was, the, establishment, of, a, totalitarian, state, which, indoctrinated, the, german, population, with, ultra, nationalist, ideas, and, violently, enforced, its, ideological, worldview, upon, the, society, heinrich, himmler, justified, the, establishment, of, a, repressive, police, state, in, which, the, security, forces, could, exercise, power, arbitrarily, by, claiming, that, national, security, and, order, should, take, precedence, over, the, needs, of, the, individual, in, his, speech, delivered, at, the, inauguration, of, the, nazi, reich, chamber, of, culture, on, 15, november, 1933, joseph, goebbels, stated, the, revolution, we, have, carried, out, is, a, total, one, it, has, embraced, all, areas, of, public, life, and, transformed, them, from, below, it, has, completely, changed, and, recast, the, relationship, of, people, to, each, other, to, the, state, and, to, life, itself, it, was, in, fact, the, breakthrough, of, a, fresh, world, view, which, had, fought, for, power, in, opposition, for, fourteen, years, to, provide, the, basis, for, the, german, people, to, develop, a, new, relationship, with, the, state, what, has, been, happening, since, 30, january, is, only, the, visible, expression, of, this, revolutionary, process, according, to, the, famous, philosopher, and, political, theorist, hannah, arendt, the, allure, of, nazism, as, a, totalitarian, ideology, with, its, attendant, mobilisation, of, the, german, population, resided, within, the, construct, of, helping, that, society, deal, with, the, cognitive, dissonance, resultant, from, the, tragic, interruption, of, the, first, world, war, and, the, economic, and, material, suffering, consequent, to, the, depression, and, brought, to, order, the, revolutionary, unrest, occurring, all, around, them, instead, of, the, plurality, that, existed, in, democratic, or, parliamentary, states, nazism, as, a, totalitarian, system, promulgated, clear, solutions, to, the, historical, problems, faced, by, germany, levied, support, by, de, legitimizing, the, former, government, of, weimar, and, provided, a, politico, biological, pathway, to, a, better, future, one, free, from, the, uncertainty, of, the, past, it, was, the, atomised, and, disaffected, masses, that, hitler, and, the, party, elite, pointed, in, a, particular, direction, and, using, clever, propaganda, to, make, them, into, ideological, adherents, exploited, in, bringing, nazism, to, life, while, the, ideologues, of, nazism, much, like, those, of, stalinism, abhorred, democratic, or, parliamentary, governance, as, practised, in, the, united, states, or, britain, their, differences, are, substantial, an, epistemic, crisis, occurs, when, one, tries, to, synthesize, and, contrast, nazism, and, stalinism, as, two, sides, of, the, same, coin, with, their, similarly, tyrannical, leaders, state, controlled, economies, and, repressive, police, structures, namely, while, they, share, a, common, thematic, political, construction, they, are, entirely, inimical, to, one, another, in, their, worldviews, and, when, more, carefully, analysed, against, one, another, on, a, one, to, one, level, an, irreconcilable, asymmetry, results, carl, schmitt, a, nazi, legal, theorist, and, member, of, prussian, state, council, characterized, the, f, hrerprinzip, as, the, ideological, foundation, of, nazi, germany, s, total, state, in, his, book, staat, bewegung, volk, 1933, schmitt, wrote, national, socialism, does, not, think, in, abstractions, and, clich, s, it, is, the, enemy, of, all, normative, and, functionalist, ways, of, proceeding, it, supports, and, cultivates, every, authentic, substance, of, the, people, wherever, it, encounters, it, in, the, countryside, in, ethnic, groups, or, classes, it, has, created, the, hereditary, farm, law, saved, the, peasantry, purged, the, civil, service, of, alien, elements, and, thus, re, stored, it, as, a, class, it, has, the, courage, to, treat, unequally, what, is, unequal, and, enforce, necessary, differentiations, although, nazism, is, often, seen, as, a, reactionary, movement, it, did, not, seek, a, return, of, germany, to, the, pre, weimar, monarchy, but, instead, looked, much, further, back, to, a, mythic, halcyon, germany, which, never, existed, it, has, also, been, seen, as, it, was, by, the, german, american, scholar, franz, leopold, neumann, as, the, result, of, a, crisis, of, capitalism, which, manifested, as, a, totalitarian, monopoly, capitalism, in, this, view, nazism, is, a, mass, movement, of, the, middle, class, which, was, in, opposition, to, a, mass, movement, of, workers, in, socialism, and, its, extreme, form, communism, historian, karl, dietrich, bracher, argues, such, an, interpretation, runs, the, risk, of, misjudging, the, revolutionary, component, of, national, socialism, which, cannot, be, dismissed, as, being, simply, reactionary, rather, from, the, very, outset, and, particularly, as, it, developed, into, the, ss, state, national, socialism, aimed, at, a, transformation, of, state, and, society, about, hitler, s, and, the, nazi, party, s, political, positions, bracher, further, claims, were, of, a, revolutionary, nature, destruction, of, existing, political, and, social, structures, and, their, supporting, elites, profound, disdain, for, civic, order, for, human, and, moral, values, for, habsburg, and, hohenzollern, for, liberal, and, marxist, ideas, the, middle, class, and, middle, class, values, bourgeois, nationalism, and, capitalism, the, professionals, the, intelligentsia, and, the, upper, class, were, dealt, the, sharpest, rebuff, these, were, the, groups, which, had, to, be, uprooted, similarly, historian, modris, eksteins, argued, contrary, to, many, interpretations, of, nazism, which, tend, to, view, it, as, a, reactionary, movement, as, in, the, words, of, thomas, mann, an, explosion, of, antiquarianism, intent, on, turning, germany, into, a, pastoral, folk, community, of, thatched, cottages, and, happy, peasants, the, general, thrust, of, the, movement, despite, archaisms, was, futuristic, nazism, was, a, headlong, plunge, into, the, future, towards, a, brave, new, world, of, course, it, used, to, advantage, residual, conservative, and, utopian, longings, paid, respect, to, these, romantic, visions, and, picked, its, ideological, trappings, from, the, german, past, but, its, goals, were, by, its, own, lights, distinctly, progressive, it, was, not, a, double, faced, janus, whose, aspects, were, equally, attentive, to, the, past, and, the, future, nor, was, it, a, modern, proteus, the, god, of, metamorphosis, who, duplicates, pre, existing, forms, the, intention, of, the, movement, was, to, create, a, new, type, of, human, being, from, whom, would, spring, a, new, morality, a, new, social, system, and, eventually, a, new, international, order, that, was, in, fact, the, intention, of, all, the, fascist, movements, after, a, visit, to, italy, and, a, meeting, with, mussolini, oswald, mosley, wrote, that, fascism, has, produced, not, only, a, new, system, of, government, but, also, a, new, type, of, man, who, differs, from, politicians, of, the, old, world, as, men, from, another, planet, hitler, talked, in, these, terms, endlessly, national, socialism, was, more, than, a, political, movement, he, said, it, was, more, than, a, faith, it, was, a, desire, to, create, mankind, anew, british, historian, ian, kershaw, in, his, history, of, europe, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, to, hell, and, back, says, about, nazism, italian, fascism, and, bolshevism, they, were, different, forms, of, a, completely, new, modern, type, of, dictatorship, the, complete, antithesis, to, liberal, democracy, they, were, all, revolutionary, if, by, that, term, we, understand, a, major, political, upheaval, driven, by, the, utopian, aim, of, changing, society, fundamentally, they, were, not, content, simply, to, use, repression, as, a, means, of, control, but, sought, to, mobilize, behind, an, exclusive, ideology, to, educate, people, into, becoming, committed, believers, to, claim, them, soul, as, well, as, body, each, of, the, regimes, was, therefore, dynamic, in, ways, that, conventional, authoritarianism, was, not, despite, such, tactical, breaks, necessitated, by, pragmatic, concerns, which, were, typical, for, hitler, during, his, rise, to, power, and, in, the, early, years, of, his, regime, those, who, see, hitler, as, a, revolutionary, argue, that, he, never, ceased, being, a, revolutionary, dedicated, to, the, radical, transformation, of, germany, especially, when, it, concerned, racial, matters, in, his, monograph, hitler, study, of, a, revolutionary, martyn, housden, concludes, compiled, a, most, extensive, set, of, revolutionary, goals, calling, for, radical, social, and, political, change, he, mobilized, a, revolutionary, following, so, extensive, and, powerful, that, many, of, his, aims, were, achieved, he, established, and, ran, a, dictatorial, revolutionary, state, and, he, disseminated, his, ideas, abroad, through, a, revolutionary, foreign, policy, and, war, in, short, he, defined, and, controlled, the, national, socialist, revolution, in, all, its, phases, there, were, aspects, of, nazism, which, were, undoubtedly, reactionary, such, as, their, attitude, toward, the, role, of, women, in, society, which, was, completely, traditionalist, calling, for, the, return, of, women, to, the, home, as, wives, mothers, and, homemakers, although, ironically, this, ideological, policy, was, undermined, in, reality, by, the, growing, labour, shortages, and, need, for, more, workers, caused, by, men, leaving, the, workforce, for, military, service, the, number, of, working, women, actually, increased, from, 4, 24, million, in, 1933, to, 4, 52, million, in, 1936, and, 5, 2, million, in, 1938, despite, active, discouragement, and, legal, barriers, put, in, place, by, the, nazi, regime, another, reactionary, aspect, of, nazism, was, in, their, arts, policy, which, stemmed, from, hitler, s, rejection, of, all, forms, of, degenerate, modern, art, music, and, architecture, historian, martin, broszat, describes, nazism, as, having, a, peculiar, hybrid, half, reactionary, half, revolutionary, relationship, to, established, society, to, the, political, system, and, tradition, ideology, was, almost, like, a, backwards, looking, utopia, it, derived, from, romantic, pictures, and, clich, s, of, the, past, from, warlike, heroic, patriarchal, or, absolutist, ages, social, and, political, systems, which, however, were, translated, into, the, popular, and, avant, garde, into, the, fighting, slogans, of, totalitarian, nationalism, the, litist, notion, of, aristocratic, nobility, became, the, v, lkische, nobility, of, blood, of, the, master, race, the, princely, theory, of, divine, right, gave, way, to, the, popular, national, f, hrer, the, obedient, submission, to, the, active, national, following, after, the, failure, of, the, beer, hall, putsch, in, 1923, and, his, subsequent, trial, and, imprisonment, hitler, decided, that, the, way, for, the, nazi, party, to, achieve, power, was, not, through, insurrection, but, through, legal, and, quasi, legal, means, this, did, not, sit, well, with, the, brown, shirted, stormtroopers, of, the, sa, especially, those, in, berlin, who, chafed, under, the, restrictions, that, hitler, placed, on, them, and, their, subordination, to, the, party, this, resulted, in, the, stennes, revolt, of, 1930, 31, after, which, hitler, made, himself, the, supreme, commander, of, the, sa, and, brought, ernst, r, hm, back, to, be, their, chief, of, staff, and, keep, them, in, line, the, quashing, of, the, sa, s, revolutionary, fervor, convinced, many, businessmen, and, military, leaders, that, the, nazis, had, put, aside, their, insurrectionist, past, and, that, hitler, could, be, a, reliable, partner, after, the, nazis, seizure, of, power, in, 1933, r, hm, and, the, brown, shirts, were, not, content, for, the, party, to, simply, carry, the, reins, of, power, instead, they, pressed, for, a, continuation, of, the, national, socialist, revolution, to, bring, about, sweeping, social, changes, which, hitler, primarily, for, tactical, reasons, was, not, willing, to, do, at, that, time, he, was, instead, focused, on, rebuilding, the, military, and, reorienting, the, economy, to, provide, the, rearmament, necessary, for, invasion, of, the, countries, to, the, east, of, germany, especially, poland, and, russia, to, get, the, lebensraum, living, space, he, believed, was, necessary, to, the, survival, of, the, aryan, race, for, this, he, needed, the, co, operation, of, not, only, the, military, but, also, the, vital, organs, of, capitalism, the, banks, and, big, businesses, which, he, would, be, unlikely, to, get, if, germany, s, social, and, economic, structure, was, being, radically, overhauled, r, hm, s, public, proclamation, that, the, sa, would, not, allow, the, german, revolution, to, be, halted, or, undermined, caused, hitler, to, announce, that, the, revolution, is, not, a, permanent, condition, the, unwillingness, of, r, hm, and, the, sa, to, cease, their, agitation, for, a, second, revolution, and, the, unwarranted, fear, of, a, r, hm, putsch, to, accomplish, it, were, factors, behind, hitler, s, purging, of, the, sa, leadership, in, the, night, of, the, long, knives, in, the, summer, of, 1934, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, the, last, german, emperor, was, appalled, at, the, kristallnacht, of, 9, 10, november, 1938, stating, for, the, first, time, i, am, ashamed, to, be, a, german,

thought, of, it, as, a, necessary, fever, and, i, was, gratified, to, see, that, there, were, associated, with, it, for, a, time, some, of, the, wisest, and, most, outstanding, germans, but, these,
