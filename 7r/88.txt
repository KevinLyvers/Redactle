the, london, stock, exchange, lse, is, a, stock, exchange, in, the, city, of, london, great, britain, as, of, august, 2023, the, total, market, value, of, all, companies, trading, on, the, lse, stood, at, 3, 18, trillion, its, current, premises, are, situated, in, paternoster, square, close, to, st, paul, s, cathedral, since, 2007, it, has, been, part, of, the, london, stock, exchange, group, lseg, which, the, exchange, also, lists, lse, lseg, despite, a, post, brexit, exodus, of, stock, listings, from, the, london, stock, exchange, the, lse, was, the, most, valued, stock, exchange, in, europe, as, of, 2023, according, to, the, 2020, office, for, national, statistics, report, approximately, 12, of, uk, resident, individuals, reported, having, investments, in, stocks, and, shares, according, to, a, 2020, financial, conduct, authority, report, approximately, 15, of, british, adults, reported, having, investments, in, stocks, and, shares, the, royal, exchange, had, been, founded, by, english, financier, thomas, gresham, and, sir, richard, clough, on, the, model, of, the, antwerp, bourse, it, was, opened, by, elizabeth, i, of, england, in, 1571, during, the, 17th, century, stockbrokers, were, not, allowed, in, the, royal, exchange, due, to, their, perceived, rude, manners, they, had, to, operate, from, other, establishments, in, the, vicinity, notably, jonathan, s, coffee, house, at, that, coffee, house, a, broker, named, john, castaing, started, listing, the, prices, of, a, few, commodities, including, salt, coal, paper, and, exchange, rates, in, 1698, originally, this, was, not, a, daily, list, and, was, only, published, a, few, days, of, the, week, this, list, and, activity, was, later, moved, to, garraway, s, coffee, house, public, auctions, during, this, period, were, conducted, for, the, duration, that, a, length, of, tallow, candle, could, burn, these, were, known, as, by, inch, of, candle, auctions, as, stocks, grew, with, new, companies, joining, to, raise, capital, the, royal, court, also, raised, some, monies, these, are, the, earliest, evidence, of, organised, trading, in, marketable, securities, in, london, after, gresham, s, royal, exchange, building, was, destroyed, in, the, great, fire, of, london, it, was, rebuilt, and, re, established, in, 1669, this, was, a, move, away, from, coffee, houses, and, a, step, towards, the, modern, model, of, stock, exchange, the, royal, exchange, housed, not, only, brokers, but, also, merchants, and, merchandise, this, was, the, birth, of, a, regulated, stock, market, which, had, teething, problems, in, the, shape, of, unlicensed, brokers, in, order, to, regulate, these, parliament, passed, an, act, in, 1697, that, levied, heavy, penalties, both, financial, and, physical, on, those, brokering, without, a, licence, it, also, set, a, fixed, number, of, brokers, at, 100, but, this, was, later, increased, as, the, size, of, the, trade, grew, this, limit, led, to, several, problems, one, of, which, was, that, traders, began, leaving, the, royal, exchange, either, by, their, own, decision, or, through, expulsion, and, started, dealing, in, the, streets, of, london, the, street, in, which, they, were, now, dealing, was, known, as, exchange, alley, or, change, alley, it, was, suitably, placed, close, to, the, bank, of, england, parliament, tried, to, regulate, this, and, ban, the, unofficial, traders, from, the, change, streets, traders, became, weary, of, bubbles, when, companies, rose, quickly, and, fell, so, they, persuaded, parliament, to, pass, a, clause, preventing, unchartered, companies, from, forming, after, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 1763, trade, at, jonathan, s, coffee, house, boomed, again, in, 1773, jonathan, together, with, 150, other, brokers, formed, a, club, and, opened, a, new, and, more, formal, stock, exchange, in, sweeting, s, alley, this, now, had, a, set, entrance, fee, by, which, traders, could, enter, the, stock, room, and, trade, securities, it, was, however, not, an, exclusive, location, for, trading, as, trading, also, occurred, in, the, rotunda, of, the, bank, of, england, fraud, was, also, rife, during, these, times, and, in, order, to, deter, such, dealings, it, was, suggested, that, users, of, the, stock, room, pay, an, increased, fee, this, was, not, met, well, and, ultimately, the, solution, came, in, the, form, of, annual, fees, and, turning, the, exchange, into, a, subscription, room, the, subscription, room, created, in, 1801, was, the, first, regulated, exchange, in, london, but, the, transformation, was, not, welcomed, by, all, parties, on, the, first, day, of, trading, non, members, had, to, be, expelled, by, a, constable, in, spite, of, the, disorder, a, new, and, bigger, building, was, planned, at, capel, court, william, hammond, laid, the, first, foundation, stone, for, the, new, building, on, 18, may, it, was, finished, on, 30, december, when, the, stock, exchange, was, incised, on, the, entrance, in, the, exchange, s, first, operating, years, on, several, occasions, there, was, no, clear, set, of, regulations, or, fundamental, laws, for, the, capel, court, trading, in, february, 1812, the, general, purpose, committee, confirmed, a, set, of, recommendations, which, later, became, the, foundation, of, the, first, codified, rule, book, of, the, exchange, even, though, the, document, was, not, a, complex, one, topics, such, as, settlement, and, default, were, in, fact, quite, comprehensive, with, its, new, governmental, commandments, and, increasing, trading, volume, the, exchange, was, progressively, becoming, an, accepted, part, of, the, financial, life, in, the, city, in, spite, of, continuous, criticism, from, newspapers, and, the, public, the, government, used, the, exchange, s, organised, market, and, would, most, likely, not, have, managed, without, it, to, raise, the, enormous, amount, of, money, required, for, the, wars, against, napoleon, after, the, war, and, facing, a, booming, world, economy, foreign, lending, to, countries, such, as, brazil, peru, and, chile, was, a, growing, market, notably, the, foreign, market, at, the, exchange, allowed, for, merchants, and, traders, to, participate, and, the, royal, exchange, hosted, all, transactions, where, foreign, parties, were, involved, the, constant, increase, in, overseas, business, eventually, meant, that, dealing, in, foreign, securities, had, to, be, allowed, within, all, of, the, exchange, s, premises, just, as, london, enjoyed, growth, through, international, trade, the, rest, of, great, britain, also, benefited, from, the, economic, boom, two, other, cities, in, particular, showed, great, business, development, liverpool, and, manchester, consequently, in, 1836, both, the, manchester, and, liverpool, stock, exchanges, were, opened, some, stock, prices, sometimes, rose, by, 10, 20, or, even, 30, in, a, week, these, were, times, when, stockbroking, was, considered, a, real, business, profession, and, such, attracted, many, entrepreneurs, nevertheless, with, booms, came, busts, and, in, 1835, the, spanish, panic, hit, the, markets, followed, by, a, second, one, two, years, later, by, june, 1853, both, participating, members, and, brokers, were, taking, up, so, much, space, that, the, exchange, was, now, uncomfortably, crowded, and, continual, expansion, plans, were, taking, place, having, already, been, extended, west, east, and, northwards, it, was, then, decided, the, exchange, needed, an, entire, new, establishment, thomas, allason, was, appointed, as, the, main, architect, and, in, march, 1854, the, new, brick, building, inspired, from, the, great, exhibition, stood, ready, this, was, a, huge, improvement, in, both, surroundings, and, space, with, twice, the, floor, space, available, by, the, late, 1800s, the, telephone, ticker, tape, and, the, telegraph, had, been, invented, those, new, technologies, led, to, a, revolution, in, the, work, of, the, exchange, as, the, financial, centre, of, the, world, both, the, city, and, the, stock, exchange, were, hit, hard, by, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, due, to, fears, that, borrowed, money, was, to, be, called, in, and, that, foreign, banks, would, demand, their, loans, or, raise, interest, prices, surged, at, first, the, decision, to, close, the, exchange, for, improved, breathing, space, and, to, extend, the, august, bank, holiday, to, prohibit, a, run, on, banks, was, hurried, through, by, the, committee, and, parliament, respectively, the, stock, exchange, ended, up, being, closed, from, the, end, of, july, until, the, new, year, causing, street, business, to, be, introduced, again, as, well, as, the, challenge, system, the, exchange, was, set, to, open, again, on, 4, january, 1915, under, tedious, restrictions, transactions, were, to, be, in, cash, only, due, to, the, limitations, and, challenges, on, trading, brought, by, the, war, almost, a, thousand, members, quit, the, exchange, between, 1914, and, 1918, when, peace, returned, in, november, 1918, the, mood, on, the, trading, floor, was, generally, cowed, in, 1923, the, exchange, received, its, own, coat, of, arms, with, the, motto, dictum, meum, pactum, my, word, is, my, bond, in, 1937, officials, at, the, exchange, used, their, experiences, from, world, war, i, to, draw, up, plans, for, how, to, handle, a, new, war, the, main, concerns, included, air, raids, and, the, subsequent, bombing, of, the, exchange, s, perimeters, and, one, suggestion, was, a, move, to, denham, buckinghamshire, this, however, never, took, place, on, the, first, day, of, september, 1939, the, exchange, closed, its, doors, until, further, notice, and, two, days, later, world, war, ii, was, declared, unlike, in, the, prior, war, the, exchange, opened, its, doors, again, six, days, later, on, 7, september, as, the, war, escalated, into, its, second, year, the, concerns, for, air, raids, were, greater, than, ever, eventually, on, the, night, of, 29, december, 1940, one, of, the, greatest, fires, in, london, s, history, took, place, the, exchange, s, floor, was, hit, by, a, clutch, of, incendiary, bombs, which, were, extinguished, quickly, trading, on, the, floor, was, now, drastically, low, and, most, was, done, over, the, phone, to, reduce, the, possibility, of, injuries, the, exchange, was, only, closed, for, one, more, day, during, wartime, in, 1945, due, to, damage, from, a, v, 2, rocket, nonetheless, trading, continued, in, the, house, s, basement, after, decades, of, uncertain, if, not, turbulent, times, stock, market, business, boomed, in, the, late, 1950s, this, spurred, multiple, officials, to, find, new, more, suitable, accommodation, the, work, on, the, new, stock, exchange, tower, began, in, 1967, the, exchange, s, new, 321, feet, 98, metres, high, building, had, 26, storeys, with, council, and, administration, at, the, top, and, middle, floors, let, out, to, affiliate, companies, queen, elizabeth, ii, opened, the, building, on, 8, november, 1972, it, was, a, new, city, landmark, with, its, 23, 000, sq, ft, 2, 100, m, 2, trading, floor, 1973, marked, a, year, of, changes, for, the, stock, exchange, first, two, trading, prohibitions, were, abolished, a, report, from, the, monopolies, and, mergers, commission, recommended, the, admittance, of, both, women, and, foreign, born, members, on, the, floor, second, in, march, the, london, stock, exchange, formally, merged, with, the, eleven, british, and, irish, regional, exchanges, including, the, scottish, stock, exchange, this, expansion, led, to, the, creation, of, a, new, position, of, chief, executive, officer, after, an, extensive, search, this, post, was, given, to, robert, fell, there, were, more, governance, changes, in, 1991, when, the, governing, council, of, the, exchange, was, replaced, by, a, board, of, directors, drawn, from, the, exchange, s, executive, customer, and, user, base, and, the, trading, name, became, the, london, stock, exchange, the, ftse, 100, index, pronounced, footsie, 100, was, launched, by, a, partnership, of, the, financial, times, and, the, stock, exchange, on, 3, january, 1984, this, turned, out, to, be, one, of, the, most, useful, indices, of, all, and, tracked, the, movements, of, the, 100, leading, companies, listed, on, the, exchange, on, 20, july, 1990, a, bomb, planted, by, the, provisional, irish, republican, army, ira, exploded, in, the, men, s, toilets, behind, the, visitors, gallery, the, area, had, already, been, evacuated, and, nobody, was, injured, about, 30, minutes, before, the, blast, at, 8, 49, a, m, a, man, who, said, he, was, a, member, of, the, ira, told, reuters, that, a, bomb, had, been, placed, at, the, exchange, and, was, about, to, explode, police, officials, said, that, if, there, had, been, no, warning, the, human, toll, would, have, been, very, high, the, explosion, ripped, a, hole, in, the, 23, storey, building, in, threadneedle, street, and, sent, a, shower, of, glass, and, concrete, onto, the, street, the, long, term, trend, towards, electronic, trading, platforms, reduced, the, exchange, s, attraction, to, visitors, and, although, the, gallery, reopened, it, was, closed, permanently, in, 1992, the, biggest, event, of, the, 1980s, was, the, sudden, de, regulation, of, the, financial, markets, in, the, uk, in, 1986, the, phrase, big, bang, was, coined, to, describe, measures, including, abolition, of, fixed, commission, charges, and, of, the, distinction, between, stockjobbers, and, stockbrokers, on, the, london, stock, exchange, as, well, as, the, change, from, an, open, outcry, to, electronic, screen, based, trading, in,
