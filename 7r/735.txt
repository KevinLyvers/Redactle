dignity, from, the, latin, dignitas, meaning, worth, worthiness, dignity, position, rank, status, authority, office, self, respect, grace, in, some, of, its, modern, usages, has, come, to, mean, the, right, of, a, person, to, be, valued, and, respected, for, their, own, sake, and, to, be, treated, ethically, in, this, context, it, is, of, significance, in, morality, ethics, law, and, politics, as, an, extension, of, the, enlightenment, era, concepts, of, inherent, inalienable, rights, the, term, may, also, be, used, to, describe, personal, conduct, as, in, behaving, with, dignity, the, content, of, contemporary, dignity, is, derived, from, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, of, 1948, summarized, in, the, principle, that, every, human, being, has, the, right, to, human, dignity, in, article, 1, it, is, stipulated, that, all, human, beings, are, born, free, and, equal, in, dignity, and, rights, they, are, endowed, with, reason, and, conscience, and, should, act, towards, one, another, in, a, spirit, of, brotherhood, the, english, word, dignity, attested, from, the, early, 13th, century, comes, from, latin, concept, of, dignitas, variously, translated, as, worthiness, or, prestige, by, way, of, french, dignit, english, speakers, often, use, the, word, dignity, in, proscriptive, and, cautionary, ways, for, example, in, politics, it, can, be, used, to, critique, the, treatment, of, oppressed, and, vulnerable, groups, and, peoples, but, it, has, also, been, applied, to, cultures, and, sub, cultures, to, religious, beliefs, and, ideals, and, even, to, animals, used, for, food, or, research, dignity, also, has, descriptive, meanings, pertaining, to, the, worth, of, human, beings, in, general, the, term, has, various, functions, and, meanings, depending, on, how, the, term, is, used, and, on, the, context, in, ordinary, modern, usage, the, word, denotes, respect, and, status, and, it, is, often, used, to, suggest, that, someone, is, not, receiving, a, proper, degree, of, respect, or, even, that, they, are, failing, to, treat, themselves, with, proper, self, respect, there, is, also, a, long, history, of, special, philosophical, use, of, this, term, however, it, is, rarely, defined, outright, in, political, legal, and, scientific, discussions, international, proclamations, have, thus, far, left, dignity, undefined, and, scientific, commentators, such, as, those, arguing, against, genetic, research, and, algeny, cite, dignity, as, a, reason, but, are, ambiguous, about, its, application, dignity, also, tends, to, connote, the, features, of, self, contained, serenity, of, a, certain, inward, and, toned, down, but, yet, translucent, and, perceptible, power, of, self, assertion, the, dignified, type, of, character, is, chary, of, emphatic, activity, rather, than, sullenly, passive, perhaps, impassive, rather, than, impassible, patient, rather, than, anxiously, defensive, and, devoid, but, not, incapable, of, aggressiveness, human, dignity, can, be, violated, in, multiple, ways, the, main, categories, of, violations, are, some, of, the, practices, that, violate, human, dignity, include, torture, rape, social, exclusion, labor, exploitation, bonded, labor, and, slavery, both, absolute, and, relative, poverty, are, violations, of, human, dignity, although, they, also, have, other, significant, dimensions, such, as, social, injustice, absolute, poverty, is, associated, with, overt, exploitation, and, connected, to, humiliation, for, example, being, forced, to, eat, food, from, other, people, s, garbage, but, being, dependent, upon, others, to, stay, alive, is, a, violation, of, dignity, even, in, the, absence, of, more, direct, violations, relative, poverty, on, the, other, hand, is, a, violation, because, the, cumulative, experience, of, not, being, able, to, afford, the, same, clothes, entertainment, social, events, education, or, other, features, of, typical, life, in, that, society, results, in, subtle, humiliation, social, rejection, marginalization, and, consequently, a, diminished, self, respect, another, example, of, violation, of, human, dignity, especially, for, women, in, developing, countries, is, lack, of, sanitation, having, no, access, to, toilets, leaves, currently, about, 1, billion, people, of, the, world, with, no, choice, other, than, to, defecation, in, the, open, which, has, been, declared, by, the, deputy, secretary, general, of, the, united, nations, as, an, affront, to, personal, dignity, human, dignity, is, also, violated, by, the, practice, of, employing, people, in, india, for, manual, scavenging, of, human, excreta, from, unsanitary, toilets, usually, by, people, of, a, lower, caste, and, more, often, by, women, than, men, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, has, been, considered, by, pope, francis, i, to, be, an, example, of, a, practice, that, violates, human, dignity, the, movie, the, magic, christian, depicts, a, wealthy, man, peter, sellers, and, his, son, ringo, starr, who, test, the, limits, of, dignity, by, forcing, people, to, perform, self, degrading, acts, for, money, the, simpsons, episode, homer, vs, dignity, has, a, similar, plot, a, philosopher, of, the, renaissance, pico, della, mirandola, granted, dignity, to, ideas, and, to, beings, in, his, oration, on, the, dignity, of, man, he, told, hostile, clerics, about, the, dignity, of, the, liberal, arts, and, about, the, dignity, and, the, glory, of, angels, his, comments, implied, the, dignity, of, philosophers, this, oration, is, commonly, seen, as, one, of, the, central, texts, of, the, renaissance, intimately, tied, with, the, growth, of, humanist, philosophies, a, philosopher, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, 18th, century, immanuel, kant, held, that, there, were, things, that, should, not, be, discussed, in, terms, of, value, and, that, these, things, could, be, said, to, have, dignity, value, is, necessarily, relative, because, the, value, of, something, depends, on, a, particular, observer, s, judgment, of, that, thing, things, that, are, not, relative, that, are, ends, in, themselves, in, kant, s, terminology, are, by, extension, beyond, all, value, and, a, thing, is, an, end, in, itself, only, if, it, has, a, moral, dimension, if, it, represents, a, choice, between, right, and, wrong, in, kant, s, words, morality, and, humanity, as, capable, of, it, is, that, which, alone, has, dignity, specifically, with, respect, to, human, dignity, which, his, writings, brought, from, relative, obscurity, in, western, philosophy, into, a, focal, point, for, philosophers, kant, held, that, free, will, is, essential, human, dignity, is, related, to, human, agency, the, ability, of, humans, to, choose, their, own, actions, philosophers, of, the, late, 20th, century, who, have, written, significant, works, on, the, subject, of, dignity, include, mortimer, adler, and, alan, gewirth, gewirth, s, views, on, human, dignity, are, typically, compared, and, contrasted, with, kant, s, for, like, kant, he, theorizes, that, human, dignity, arises, from, agency, but, while, sharing, kant, s, view, that, rights, arise, from, dignity, gewirth, focused, far, more, than, kant, on, the, positive, obligations, that, dignity, imposed, on, humans, the, moral, requirement, not, only, to, avoid, harming, but, to, actively, assist, one, another, in, achieving, and, maintaining, a, state, of, well, being, among, other, topics, including, the, dignity, of, labor, adler, extensively, explored, the, question, of, human, equality, and, equal, right, to, dignity, according, to, adler, the, question, of, whether, humans, have, equal, right, to, dignity, is, intrinsically, bound, in, the, question, of, whether, human, beings, are, truly, equal, which, itself, is, bound, in, the, question, of, whether, human, beings, are, a, distinct, class, from, all, things, including, animals, or, vary, from, other, things, only, by, degree, adler, wrote, that, the, only, sense, in, which, it, is, true, that, all, human, beings, are, equal, is, that, they, are, equally, distinct, from, animals, the, dignity, of, man, he, said, is, the, dignity, of, the, human, being, as, a, person, a, dignity, that, is, not, possessed, by, things, to, adler, failure, to, recognize, the, distinction, challenged, the, right, of, humans, to, equal, dignity, and, equal, treatment, dan, egonsson, followed, by, roger, wertheimer, argued, that, while, it, is, conventional, for, people, to, equate, dignity, with, being, human, egonsson, s, standard, attitude, wertheimer, s, standard, belief, people, generally, also, import, something, other, than, mere, humanness, to, their, idea, of, dignity, egonsson, suggested, that, an, entity, must, be, both, human, and, alive, to, merit, an, ascription, of, dignity, while, wertheimer, states, it, is, not, a, definitional, truth, that, human, beings, have, human, status, according, to, arthur, schopenhauer, dignity, is, opinion, of, others, about, our, worth, and, subjective, definition, of, dignity, is, our, fear, from, this, opinion, of, others, karl, marx, s, views, on, dignity, were, complex, and, debates, over, the, role, of, dignity, in, his, thought, relate, to, the, question, of, whether, marx, s, critique, of, capitalism, had, a, moral, dimension, marx, wrote, positively, about, dignity, in, his, early, work, and, suggested, it, could, underpin, his, theory, of, alienation, however, he, elsewhere, rejected, the, view, that, humans, have, a, right, to, dignity, and, argued, that, moral, norms, could, not, form, the, basis, of, a, critique, of, capitalism, because, they, form, part, of, society, s, ideological, superstructure, the, philosopher, somogy, varga, argues, that, marx, s, account, of, dignity, forms, part, of, a, critique, of, kantian, ethics, as, unjusifiably, imagining, moral, values, to, be, transhistorical, rather, than, emerging, from, historical, processes, and, social, practices, more, recently, philippe, andr, rodriguez, has, argued, that, human, dignity, is, best, understood, as, an, essentially, contested, concept, as, he, argues, it, seems, that, it, is, this, very, nature, of, the, concept, that, has, allowed, on, the, one, hand, human, rights, to, receive, such, international, acceptance, as, a, theoretical, enterprise, and, on, the, other, hand, has, led, the, concept, to, be, constantly, challenged, by, different, cultures, worldwide, human, dignity, is, a, central, consideration, of, christian, philosophy, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, insists, that, the, dignity, of, the, human, person, is, rooted, in, his, or, her, creation, in, the, image, and, likeness, of, god, all, human, beings, says, the, church, in, as, much, as, they, are, created, in, the, image, of, god, have, the, dignity, of, a, person, the, catechism, states, that, the, right, to, the, exercise, of, freedom, belongs, to, everyone, because, it, is, inseparable, from, his, or, her, dignity, as, a, human, person, and, also, links, animal, welfare, to, human, dignity, it, is, contrary, to, human, dignity, to, cause, animals, to, suffer, or, die, needlessly, the, catholic, church, proclaims, the, equal, dignity, of, all, people, regardless, of, their, living, conditions, or, qualities, this, dignity, comes, from, the, love, of, the, creator, for, humans, that, are, created, in, his, image, this, dignity, was, further, elevated, by, the, incarnation, and, resurrection, of, christ, since, it, caused, humans, to, share, the, nature, of, god, specifically, human, dignity, is, intrinsic, to, human, persons, and, does, not, spring, from, agency, or, free, will, human, dignity, or, kevod, ha, beriyot, is, also, a, central, consideration, of, judaism, talmud, cautions, against, giving, charity, publicly, rather, than, in, private, to, avoid, offending, the, dignity, of, the, recipient, medieval, jewish, philosopher, maimonides, in, his, codification, of, halakha, cautioned, judges, to, preserve, the, self, respect, of, people, who, came, before, them, let, not, human, dignity, be, light, in, his, eyes, for, the, respect, due, to, man, supersedes, a, negative, rabbinical, command, an, islamic, view, of, dignity, is, crystallized, in, the, quran, through, the, selected, biographies, of, noah, abraham, joseph, david, moses, mary, jesus, muhammed, and, others, differing, from, the, narratives, in, the, bible, which, the, quran, claims, were, corrupted, individuals, such, as, these, are, presented, as, role, models, of, dignity, because, they, did, not, abandon, their, self, respect, by, bowing, to, social, pressures, when, faced, with, the, fear, of, disapproval, poverty, hunger, death, etc, these, individuals, held, firm, in, their, sense, of, right, and, wrong, which, was, in, line, with, divine, ordinances, the, right, course, is, that, on, which, one, keeps, his, attitudes, ambitions, and, requirements, subjected, to, the, divine, laws, and, in, this, way, leads, a, balanced, and, graceful, life, such, a, person, has, grasped, the, most, trustworthy, support, which, will, never, fail, him, quran, 31, 22, such, individuals, are, given, the, title, of, muhsineen, who, faced, immense, pressures, but, held, firm, in, their, positive, actions, god, awarded, these, individuals, with, authority, and, status, in, the, land, and, this, reward, is, open, to, anyone, who, proves, themselves, worthy, we, bestow, such, honour, and, position, on, all, those, who, lead, their, lives, according, to, our, laws, quran, 37, 80, those, who, fall, into, this, category, are, also, afforded, divine, protection, from, their, mistakes, therefore, we, have, saved, you, and, your, son, from, this, we, have, done, so, because, we, keep, those, who, lead, their, lives, according, to, divine, guidance, safe, from, such, mishaps, 37, 104, 105, the, quranic, state, that, muhammad, began, in, medinah, sought, to, protect, human, dignity, since, in, a, quranic, welfare, state, individuals, are, free, to, work, and, live, without, the, pressures, faced, by, the, threat, of, poverty, and, thus, can, obey, god, s, laws, as, free, individuals, contributing, as, part, of, a, unified, brotherhood, working, towards, achieving, humanity, s, full, potential, elaborations, on, dignity, have, been, made, by, many, scholars, of, islam, such, as, mohammad, ali, taskhiri, head, of, the, islamic, culture, and, communications, organization, in, iran, in, 1994, according, to, taskhiri, dignity, is, a, state, to, which, all, humans, have, equal, potential, but, which, can, only, be, actualized, by, living, a, life, pleasing, to, the, eyes, of, god, this, is, in, keeping, with, the, 1990, cairo, declaration, on, human, rights, in, islam, which, states, that, true, faith, is, the, guarantee, for, enhancing, such, dignity, along, the, path, to, human, perfection, ultimately, the, buddhist, understanding, of, human, dignity, is, rooted, in, the, idea, that, people, are, able, to, choose, the, path, of, self, perfection, the, state, of, self, perfection, a, condition, of, fully, developed, courage, wisdom, and, compassion, is, described, as, buddhahood, or, enlightenment, the, idea, that, all, people, all, life, in, fact, have, this, potential, is, expressed, by, the, concept, stressed, particularly, in, the, mahayana, tradition, that, all, living, beings, possess, buddha, nature, in, the, 20th, century, dignity, became, an, issue, for, physicians, and, medical, researchers, it, has, been, invoked, in, questions, of, the, bioethics, of, human, genetic, engineering, human, cloning, and, end, of, life, care, particularly, in, such,
