acquired, by, some, form, of, nominal, divine, right, or, blessing, or, religious, sanction, the, political, legitimacy, and, authority, of, the, monarch, may, vary, from, restricted, and, largely, symbolic, constitutional, monarchy, to, fully, autocratic, absolute, monarchy, and, can, span, across, executive, legislative, and, judicial, domains, the, succession, of, monarchs, has, mostly, been, hereditary, often, building, dynasties, however, elective, and, self, proclaimed, monarchies, in, the, sense, of, monarchical, states, have, also, often, occurred, throughout, history, aristocrats, though, not, inherent, to, monarchies, often, function, as, the, pool, of, persons, from, which, the, monarch, is, chosen, and, to, fill, the, constituting, institutions, e, g, diet, and, court, giving, many, monarchies, oligarchic, elements, monarchs, can, carry, various, titles, such, as, emperor, empress, king, and, queen, monarchies, can, form, federations, personal, unions, and, realms, with, vassals, through, personal, association, with, the, monarch, which, is, a, common, reason, for, monarchs, carrying, several, titles, monarchies, were, the, most, common, form, of, government, until, the, 20th, century, when, republics, replaced, many, monarchies, notably, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, as, of, 2024, forty, three, sovereign, nations, in, the, world, have, a, monarch, including, fifteen, commonwealth, realms, that, share, king, charles, iii, as, their, head, of, state, other, than, that, there, is, a, range, of, sub, national, monarchical, entities, most, of, the, modern, monarchies, are, constitutional, monarchies, retaining, under, a, constitution, unique, legal, and, ceremonial, roles, for, monarchs, exercising, limited, or, no, political, power, similar, to, heads, of, state, in, a, parliamentary, republic, some, countries, have, preserved, the, title, of, say, kingdom, while, dispensing, with, an, official, serving, monarch, note, the, example, of, francoist, spain, from, 1947, to, 1975, or, while, relying, on, a, long, term, regency, as, in, the, case, of, hungary, in, the, horthy, era, from, 1920, to, 1944, the, word, monarch, late, latin, monarchia, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, word, mon, rkh, s, derived, from, m, nos, one, single, and, rkh, to, rule, compare, rkh, n, ruler, chief, it, referred, to, a, single, at, least, nominally, absolute, ruler, in, current, usage, the, word, monarchy, usually, refers, to, a, traditional, system, of, hereditary, rule, as, elective, monarchies, are, quite, rare, the, similar, form, of, societal, hierarchy, known, as, chiefdom, or, tribal, kingship, is, prehistoric, chiefdoms, provided, the, concept, of, state, formation, which, started, with, civilizations, such, as, mesopotamia, ancient, egypt, and, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, some, parts, of, the, world, chiefdoms, became, monarchies, some, of, the, oldest, recorded, and, evidenced, monarchies, were, narmer, pharaoh, of, ancient, egypt, c, 3100, bce, and, enmebaragesi, a, sumerian, king, of, kish, c, 2600, bce, from, earliest, records, monarchs, could, be, directly, hereditary, while, others, were, elected, from, among, eligible, members, with, the, egyptian, chinese, indian, mesopotamian, sudanic, reconstructed, proto, indo, european, religion, and, others, the, monarch, held, sacral, functions, directly, connected, to, sacrifice, and, was, sometimes, identified, with, having, divine, ancestry, possibly, establishing, a, notion, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, polybius, identified, monarchy, as, one, of, three, benign, basic, forms, of, government, monarchy, aristocracy, and, democracy, opposed, to, the, three, malignant, basic, forms, of, government, tyranny, oligarchy, and, ochlocracy, the, monarch, in, classical, antiquity, is, often, identified, as, king, or, ruler, translating, archon, basileus, rex, tyrannos, etc, or, as, queen, basilinna, basilissa, basileia, or, basilis, regina, polybius, originally, understood, monarchy, as, a, component, of, republics, but, since, antiquity, monarchy, has, contrasted, with, forms, of, republic, where, executive, power, is, wielded, by, free, citizens, and, their, assemblies, the, 4th, century, bce, hindu, text, arthasastra, laid, out, the, ethics, of, monarchism, in, antiquity, some, monarchies, were, abolished, in, favour, of, such, assemblies, in, rome, roman, republic, 509, bce, and, athens, athenian, democracy, 500, bce, by, the, 17th, century, monarchy, was, challenged, by, evolving, parliamentarism, e, g, through, regional, assemblies, such, as, the, icelandic, commonwealth, the, swiss, landsgemeinde, and, later, tagsatzung, and, the, high, medieval, communal, movement, linked, to, the, rise, of, medieval, town, privileges, and, by, modern, anti, monarchism, e, g, of, the, temporary, overthrow, of, the, english, monarchy, by, the, parliament, of, england, in, 1649, the, american, revolution, of, 1776, and, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, one, of, many, opponents, of, that, trend, was, elizabeth, dawbarn, whose, anonymous, dialogue, between, clara, neville, and, louisa, mills, on, loyalty, 1794, features, silly, louisa, who, admires, liberty, tom, paine, and, the, us, lectured, by, clara, on, god, s, approval, of, monarchy, and, on, the, influence, women, can, exert, on, men, since, then, advocacy, of, the, abolition, of, a, monarchy, or, respectively, of, republics, has, been, called, republicanism, while, the, advocacy, of, monarchies, is, called, monarchism, as, such, republics, have, become, the, opposing, and, alternative, form, of, government, to, monarchy, despite, some, having, seen, infringements, through, lifelong, or, even, hereditary, heads, of, state, such, as, in, north, korea, with, the, rise, of, republicanism, a, diverse, division, between, republicanism, developed, in, the, 19th, century, politics, such, as, anti, monarchist, radicalism, and, conservative, or, even, reactionary, monarchism, in, the, following, 20th, century, many, countries, abolished, the, monarchy, and, became, republics, especially, in, the, wake, of, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, today, forty, three, sovereign, nations, in, the, world, have, a, monarch, including, fifteen, commonwealth, realms, that, have, charles, iii, as, the, head, of, state, most, modern, monarchs, are, constitutional, monarchs, who, retain, a, unique, legal, and, ceremonial, role, but, exercise, limited, or, no, political, power, under, a, constitution, many, are, so, called, crowned, republics, surviving, particularly, in, small, states, in, some, nations, however, such, as, morocco, qatar, liechtenstein, and, thailand, the, hereditary, monarch, has, more, political, influence, than, any, other, single, source, of, authority, in, the, state, even, if, it, is, by, a, constitutional, mandate, according, to, a, 2020, study, monarchy, arose, as, a, system, of, governance, because, of, an, efficiency, in, governing, large, populations, and, expansive, territories, during, periods, when, coordinating, such, populations, was, difficult, the, authors, argue, that, monarchy, declined, as, an, efficient, regime, type, with, innovations, in, communications, and, transportation, technology, as, the, efficiency, of, monarchy, relative, to, other, regime, types, declined, according, to, a, 2023, study, monarchy, has, persisted, as, a, regime, type, because, it, can, accommodate, demands, for, democratization, better, than, other, forms, of, autocratic, rule, monarchies, can, democratize, without, destabilizing, the, leadership, through, transitioning, to, a, democratic, constitutional, monarchy, the, prospect, of, retaining, the, ruler, appeals, to, opposition, groups, who, value, both, democracy, and, stability, but, it, also, has, implications, for, their, ability, to, organize, and, sustain, mass, protest, monarchies, are, associated, with, hereditary, reign, in, which, monarchs, reign, for, life, and, the, responsibilities, and, power, of, the, position, pass, to, their, child, or, another, member, of, their, family, when, they, die, most, monarchs, both, historically, and, in, the, modern, day, have, been, born, and, brought, up, within, a, royal, family, the, centre, of, the, royal, household, and, court, growing, up, in, a, royal, family, called, a, dynasty, when, it, continues, for, several, generations, future, monarchs, are, often, trained, for, their, expected, future, responsibilities, as, monarch, different, systems, of, hereditary, succession, have, been, used, such, as, proximity, of, blood, primogeniture, and, agnatic, seniority, salic, law, while, most, monarchs, in, history, have, been, male, many, female, monarchs, also, have, reigned, the, term, queen, regnant, refers, to, a, ruling, monarch, while, queen, consort, refers, to, the, wife, of, a, reigning, king, rule, may, be, hereditary, in, practice, without, being, considered, a, monarchy, there, have, been, some, family, dictatorships, and, also, political, families, in, many, democracies, the, principal, advantage, of, hereditary, monarchy, is, the, immediate, continuity, of, leadership, as, evidenced, in, the, classic, phrase, the, king, is, dead, long, live, the, king, some, monarchies, are, not, hereditary, in, an, elective, monarchy, monarchs, are, elected, or, appointed, by, some, body, an, electoral, college, for, life, or, a, defined, period, four, elective, monarchies, exist, today, cambodia, malaysia, and, the, united, arab, emirates, are, 20th, century, creations, while, one, the, papacy, is, ancient, a, self, proclaimed, monarchy, is, established, when, a, person, claims, the, monarchy, without, any, historical, ties, to, a, previous, dynasty, there, are, examples, of, republican, leaders, who, have, proclaimed, themselves, monarchs, napoleon, i, of, france, declared, himself, emperor, of, the, french, and, ruled, the, first, french, empire, after, having, held, the, title, of, first, consul, of, the, french, republic, for, five, years, from, his, seizing, power, in, the, coup, of, 18,

of, the, republic, of, china, crowned, himself, emperor, of, the, short, lived, empire, of, china, a, few, years, after, the, republic, of, china, was, founded, most, monarchies, only, have, a, single, person, acting, as, monarch, at, any, given, time, although, two, monarchs, have, ruled, simultaneously, in, some, countries, a, situation, known, as, diarchy, historically, this, was, the, case, in, the, ancient, greek, city, state, of, sparta, there, are, examples, of, joint, sovereignty, of, spouses, parent, and, child, or, other, relatives, such, as, william, iii, and, mary, ii, in, the, kingdoms, of, england, and, scotland, tsars, peter, i, and, ivan, v, of, russia, and, charles, i, and, joanna, of, castile, andorra, currently, is, the, world, s, only, constitutional, diarchy,

laws, and, government, the, fifteen, separate, commonwealth, realms, are, sometimes, described, as, being, in, a, personal, union, with, king, charles, iii, as, monarch, however, they, can, also, be, described, as, being, in, a, shared, monarchy, a, regent, may, rule, when, the, monarch, is, a, minor, absent, or, debilitated, a, pretender, is, a, claimant, to, an, abolished, throne, or, a, throne,

with, a, coronation, or, enthronement, monarchy, especially, absolute, monarchy, is, sometimes, linked, to, religious, aspects, many, monarchs, once, claimed, the, right, to, rule, by, the, will, of, a, deity, divine, right, of, kings, mandate, of, heaven, or, a, special, connection, to, a, deity, sacred, king, or, even, purported, to, be, divine, kings, or, incarnations, of, deities, themselves,

in, the, western, political, tradition, a, morally, based, balanced, monarchy, was, stressed, as, the, ideal, form, of, government, and, little, attention, was, paid, to, modern, day, ideals, of, egalitarian, democracy, e, g, saint, thomas, aquinas, unapologetically, declared, tyranny, is, wont, to, occur, not, less, but, more, frequently, on, the, basis, of, polyarchy, than, on, the, basis, of, monarchy, on, kingship, however, thomas, aquinas, also, stated, that, the, ideal, monarchical, system, would, also, have, at, lower, levels, of, government, both, an, aristocracy, and, elements, of, democracy, in, order, to, create, a, balance, of, power, the, monarch, would, also, be, subject, to, both, natural, and, divine, law, and, to, the, church, in, matters, of, religion, in, dante,

colonialists, when, they, first, arrived, on, the, continent, are, now, constitutionally, protected, as, regional, or, sectional, entities, furthermore, in, nigeria, though, the, hundreds, of, sub, regional, polities, that, exist, there, are, not, provided, for, in, the, current, constitution, they, are, nevertheless, legally, recognised, aspects, of, the, structure, of, governance, that, operates, in, the, nation, for, example, the, yoruba, city, state, of, akure, in, south, western, nigeria, is, something, of, an, elective, monarchy, its, reigning, oba, deji, has, to, be, chosen, by,

carried, and, occupied, by, the, monarch, but, represents, the, monarchy, even, in, absence, and, succession, of, the, monarch, nevertheless, monarchies, can, also, be, bound, to, territories, e, g, the, king, of, norway, and, peoples, e, g, the, king, of, the, belgians, in, a, hereditary, monarchy, the, position, of, monarch, is, inherited, according, to, a, statutory, or, customary, order, of, succession, usually, within, one, royal, family, tracing, its, origin, through, a, historical, dynasty, or, bloodline, this, usually, means, that, the, heir, to, the, throne, is, known, well, in, advance, of, becoming, monarch, to, ensure, a, smooth, succession, primogeniture, in, which, the, eldest, child, of, the, monarch, is, first, in, line, to, become, monarch, is, the, most, common, system, in, hereditary, monarchy, the, order, of, succession, is, usually, affected, by, rules, on, gender, historically, agnatic, primogeniture, or, patrilineal, primogeniture, was, favoured, that, is, inheritance, according, to, seniority, of, birth, among, the, sons, of, a, monarch, or, head, of, family, with, sons, and, their, male, issue, inheriting, before, brothers, and, their, male, issue, to, the, total, exclusion, of, females, and, descendants, through, females, from, succession, this, complete, exclusion, of, females, from, dynastic, succession, is, commonly, referred, to, as, application, of, the, salic, law, another, variation, on, agnatic, primogeniture, was, the, so, called, semi, salic, law, or, agnatic, cognatic, primogeniture, which, allowed, women, to, succeed, only, at, the, extinction, of, all, the, male, descendants, in, the, male, line, of, the, particular, legislator, before, primogeniture, was, enshrined, in, european, law, and, tradition, kings, would, often, secure, the, succession, by, having, their, successor, usually, their, eldest, son, crowned, during, their, own, lifetime, so, for, a, time, there, would, be, two, kings, in, coregency, a, senior, king, and, a, junior, king, examples, were, henry, the, young, king, of, england, and, the, early, direct, capetians, in, france, sometimes, however, primogeniture, can, operate, through, the, female, line, in, 1980, sweden, became, the, first, monarchy, to, declare, equal, full, cognatic, primogeniture, meaning, that, the, eldest, child, of, the, monarch, whether, female, or, male, ascends, to, the, throne, other, kingdoms, such, as, the, netherlands, in, 1983, norway, in, 1990, belgium, in, 1991, denmark, in, 2009, and, luxembourg, in, 2011, have, since, followed, suit, the, united, kingdom, adopted, absolute, equal, primogeniture, subject, to, the, claims, of, existing, heirs, on, april, 25, 2013, following, agreement, by, the, prime, ministers, of, the, sixteen, commonwealth, realms, at, the, 22nd, commonwealth, heads, of, government, meeting, in, the, absence, of, children, the, next, most, senior, member, of, the, collateral, line, for, example, a, younger, sibling, of, the, previous, monarch, becomes, monarch, in, complex, cases, this, can, mean, that, there, are, closer, blood, relatives, to, the, deceased, monarch, than, the, next, in, line, according, to, primogeniture, this, has, often, led, especially, in, europe, in, the, middle, ages, to, conflict, between, the, principle, of, primogeniture, and, the, principle, of, proximity, of, blood, other, hereditary, systems, of, succession, included, tanistry, which, is, semi, elective, and, gives, weight, to, merit, and, agnatic, seniority, in, some, monarchies, such, as, saudi, arabia, succession, to, the, throne, first, passes, to, the, monarch, s, next, eldest, brother, and, only, after, that, to, the, monarch, s, children, agnatic, seniority, however, on, june, 21, 2017, king, salman, of, saudi, arabi, revolted, against, this, style, of, monarchy, and, elected, his, son, to, inherit, the, throne, in, an, elective, monarchy, monarchs, are, elected, or, appointed, by, somebody, an, electoral, college, for, life, or, a, defined, period, but, then, reign, like, any, other, monarch, there, is, no, popular, vote, involved, in, elective, monarchies, as, the, elective, body, usually, consists, of, a, small, number, of, eligible, people, historical, examples, of, elective, monarchy, are, the, holy, roman, emperors, chosen, by, prince, electors, but, often, coming, from, the, same, dynasty, and, the, free, election, of, kings, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, for, example, pepin, the, short, father, of, charlemagne, was, elected, king, of, the, franks, by, an, assembly, of, frankish, leading, men, nobleman, stanis, aw, august, poniatowski, of, poland, was, an, elected, king, as, was, frederick, i, of, denmark, gallic, and, germanic, peoples, also,
