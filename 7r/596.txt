cause, a, decline, in, advertising, and, circulation, as, many, papers, had, to, retrench, operations, to, stanch, the, losses, worldwide, annual, revenue, approached, 100, billion, in, 2005, 7, then, plunged, during, the, worldwide, financial, crisis, of, 2008, 9, revenue, in, 2016, fell, to, only, 53, billion, hurting, every, major, publisher, as, their, efforts, to, gain, online, income, fell, far, short, of, the, goal, the, decline, in, advertising, revenues, affected, both, the, print, and, online, media, as, well, as, all, other, mediums, print, advertising, was, once, lucrative, but, has, greatly, declined, and, the, prices, of, online, advertising, are, often, lower, than, those, of, their, print, precursors, besides, remodelling, advertising, the, internet, especially, the, web, has, also, challenged, the, business, models, of, the, print, only, era, by, crowdsourcing, both, publishing, in, general, sharing, information, with, others, and, more, specifically, journalism, the, work, of, finding, assembling, and, reporting, the, news, besides, the, rise, of, news, aggregators, which, bundle, linked, articles, from, many, online, newspapers, and, other, sources, influences, the, flow, of, web, traffic, increasing, paywalling, of, online, newspapers, may, be, counteracting, those, effects, the, oldest, newspaper, still, published, is, the, ordinari, post, tijdender,

typically, sunday, is, called, the, newspaper, s, circulation, and, is, one, of, the, principal, factors, used, to, set, advertising, rates, circulation, is, not, necessarily, the, same, as, copies, sold, since, some, copies, or, newspapers, are, distributed, without, cost, readership, figures, may, be, higher, than, circulation, figures, because, many, copies, are, read, by, more, than, one,

a, percentage, of, households, that, receive, a, copy, of, the, newspaper, against, the, total, number, of, households, in, the, paper, s, market, area, in, the, 1920s, on, a, national, basis, in, the, u, s, daily, newspapers, achieved, market, penetration, of, 123, percent, meaning, the, average, u, s, household, received, 1, 23, newspapers, as, other, media, began, to, compete, with, newspapers, and, as, printing, became, easier, and, less, expensive, giving, rise, to, a, greater, diversity, of, publications, market, penetration, began, to, decline, it, was, not, until, the, early, 1970s, however, that, market, penetration, dipped, below, 100, percent, by, 2000, it, was, 53, percent, and, still, falling, many, paid, for, newspapers, offer, a, variety, of, subscription, plans, for, example, someone, might, want, only, a, sunday, paper, or, perhaps, only, sunday, and, saturday, or, maybe, only, a, workweek, subscription, or, perhaps, a, daily, subscription, most, newspapers, provide, some, or, all, of, their, content, on, the, internet, either, at, no, cost, or, for, a, fee, in, some, cases, free, access, is, available, only, for, a, matter, of, days, or,

generates, 70, 80, of, its, revenue, from, advertising, and, the, remainder, from, sales, and, subscriptions, the, portion, of, the, newspaper, that, is, not, advertising, is, called, editorial, content, editorial, matter, or, simply, editorial, although, the, last, term, is, also, used, to, refer, specifically, to, those, articles, in, which, the, newspaper, and, its, guest, writers, express, their, opinions, this, distinction, however, developed, over, time, early, publishers, like, girardin, france, and, zang, austria, did, not, always, distinguish, paid, items, from, editorial, content, the, business, model, of, having, advertising, subsidize, the, cost, of, printing, and, distributing, newspapers, and, it, is, always, hoped, the, making, of, a, profit, rather, than, having, subscribers, cover, the, full, cost, was, first, done, it, seems, in, 1833, by, the, sun, a, daily, paper, that, was, published, in, new, york, city, rather, than, charging, 6, cents, per, copy, the, price, of, a, typical, new, york, daily, at, the, time, they, charged, 1, cent, and, depended, on, advertising, to, make, up, the, difference, newspapers, in, countries, with, easy, access, to, the, web, have, been, hurt, by, the, decline, of, many, traditional, advertisers, department, stores, and, supermarkets, could, be, relied, upon, in, the, past, to, buy, pages, of, newspaper, advertisements, but, due, to, industry, consolidation, are, much, less, likely, to, do, so, now, additionally, newspapers, are, seeing, traditional, advertisers, shift, to, new, media, platforms, the, classified, category, is, shifting, to, sites, including, craigslist, employment, websites, and, auto, sites, national, advertisers, are, shifting, to, many, types, of, digital, content, including, websites, rich, media, platforms, and, mobile, in, recent, years, the, advertorial, emerged, advertorials, are, most, commonly, recognized, as, an, opposite, editorial, which, third, parties, pay, a, fee, to, have, included, in, the, paper, advertorials, commonly, advertise, new, products, or, techniques, such, as, a, new, design, for, golf, equipment, a, new, form, of, laser, surgery, or, weight, loss, drugs, the, tone, is, usually, closer, to, that, of, a, press, release, than, of, an, objective, news, story, such, articles, are, often, clearly, distinguished, from, editorial, content, through, either, the, design, and, layout, of, the, page, or, with, a, label, declaring, the, article, as, an, advertisement, however, there, has, been, growing, concern, over, the, blurring, of, the, line, between, editorial, and, advertorial, content, since, newspapers, began, as, a, journal, record, of, current, events, the, profession, involved, in, the, making, of, newspapers, began, to, be, called, journalism, in, the, yellow, journalism, era, of, the, 19th, century, many, newspapers, in, the, united, states, relied, on, sensational, stories, that, were, meant, to, anger, or, excite, the, public, rather, than, to, inform, the, restrained, style, of, reporting, that, relies, on, fact, checking, and, accuracy, regained, popularity, around, world, war, ii, criticism, of, journalism, is, varied, and, sometimes, vehement, credibility, is, questioned, because, of, anonymous, sources, errors, in, facts, spelling, and, grammar, real, or, perceived, bias, and, scandals, involving, plagiarism, and, fabrication, in, the, past, newspapers, have, often, been, owned, by, so, called, press, barons, and, were, used, for, gaining, a, political, voice, after, 1920, most, major, newspapers, became, parts, of, chains, run, by, large, media, corporations, such, as, gannett, the, mcclatchy, company, hearst, corporation, cox, enterprises, landmark, media, enterprises, llc, morris, communications, the, tribune, company, hollinger, international, news, corporation, swift, communications, etc, newspapers, have, in, the, modern, world, played, an, important, role, in, the, exercise, of, freedom, of, expression, whistle, blowers, and, those, who, leak, stories, of, corruption, in, political, circles, often, choose, to, inform, newspapers, before, other, mediums, of, communication, relying, on, the, perceived, willingness, of, newspaper, editors, to, expose, the, secrets, and, lies, of, those, who, would, rather, cover, them, however, there, have, been, many, circumstances, of, the, political, autonomy, of, newspapers, being, curtailed, recent, research, has, examined, the, effects, of, a, newspaper, s, closing, on, the, reelection, of, incumbents, voter, turnout, and, campaign, spending, opinions, of, other, writers, and, readers, are, expressed, in, the, op, ed, opposite, the, editorial, page, and, letters, to, the, editors, sections, of, the, paper, some, ways, newspapers, have, tried, to, improve, their, credibility, are, appointing, ombudsmen, developing, ethics, policies, and, training, using, more, stringent, corrections, policies, communicating, their, processes, and, rationale, with, readers, and, asking, sources, to, review, articles, after, publication, by, the, late, 1990s, the, availability, of, news, via, 24, hour, television, channels, and, the, subsequent, availability, of, online, journalism, posed, an, ongoing, challenge, to, the, business, model, of, most, newspapers, in, developed, countries, paid, newspaper, circulation, has, declined, while, advertising, revenue, the, bulk, of, most, newspapers, income, has, been, shifting, from, print, to, social, media, and, news, websites, resulting, in, a, general, decline, one, of, the, challenges, is, that, a, number, of, online, news, websites, are, free, to, access, other, online, news, sites, have, a, paywall, and, require, paid, subscription, for, access, in, less, developed, countries, cheaper, printing, and, distribution, increased, literacy, a, growing, middle, class, and, other, factors, have, compensated, for, the, emergence, of, electronic, media, and, newspaper, circulation, continues, to, grow, in, april, 1995, the, american, reporter, became, the, first, daily, internet, based, newspaper, with, its, own, paid, reporters, and, original, content, the, future, of, newspapers, in, countries, with, high, levels, of, internet, access, has, been, widely, debated, as, the, industry, has, faced, down, soaring, newsprint, prices, slumping, ad, sales, the, loss, of, much, classified, advertising, and, precipitous, drops, in, circulation, since, the, late, 1990s, the, number, of, newspapers, slated, for, closure, bankruptcy, or, severe, cutbacks, has, risen, especially, in, the, united, states, where, the, industry, has, shed, a, fifth, of, its, journalists, since, 2001, a, june, 2022, report, estimated, that, 2, newspapers, die, each, week, and, revealed, that, the, us, dropped, from, 8, 891, newspapers, in, 2005, to, 6, 377, at, the, end, of, may, 2022, journalism, jobs, dropped, from, about, 75, 000, in, 2006, to, 31, 000, in, 2022, the, debate, has, become, more, urgent, lately, as, the, 2008, 2009, recession, shaved, newspapers, profits, and, as, once, explosive, growth, in, web, revenue, has, leveled, off, forestalling, what, the, industry, hoped, would, become, an, important, source, of, revenue, at, issue, is, whether, the, newspaper, industry, faces, a, cyclical, trough, or, dip, or, whether, new, technology, has, rendered, print, newspapers, obsolete, as, of, 2017, an, increasing, percentage, of, millennials, get, their, news, from, social, media, websites, in, the, 2010s, many, traditional, newspapers, have, begun, offering, digital, editions, accessible, via, computers, and, mobile, devices, online, advertising, allows, news, websites, to, show, catered, ads, based, on, a, visitor, s, interests, the, themes, explained, at, newspapers, in, the, united, states, archives, are, broadly, similar, to, experience, elsewhere, in, the, web, era, digital, archives, have, been, continually, supplanting, earlier, microform, and, hard, copy, archives, and, the, latter, two, media, have, increasingly, been, digitized, via, image, scanning, usually, in, concert, with, optical, character, recognition, at, the, same, time, then, as, the, printing, press, in, the, physical, technological, sense, was, invented, the, press, in, the, extended, sense, of, the, word, also, entered, the, historical, stage, the, phenomenon, of, publishing, was, now, born
