linguistic, typology, or, language, typology, is, a, field, of, linguistics, that, studies, and, classifies, languages, according, to, their, structural, features, to, allow, their, comparison, its, aim, is, to, describe, and, explain, the, structural, diversity, and, the, common, properties, of, the, world, s, languages, its, subdisciplines, include, but, are, not, limited, to, phonological, typology, which, deals, with, sound, features, syntactic, typology, which, deals, with, word, order, and, form, lexical, typology, which, deals, with, language, vocabulary, and, theoretical, typology, which, aims, to, explain, the, universal, tendencies, linguistic, typology, is, contrasted, with, genealogical, linguistics, on, the, grounds, that, typology, groups, languages, or, their, grammatical, features, based, on, formal, similarities, rather, than, historic, descendence, the, issue, of, genealogical, relation, is, however, relevant, to, typology, because, modern, data, sets, aim, to, be, representative, and, unbiased, samples, are, collected, evenly, from, different, language, families, emphasizing, the, importance, of, lesser, known, languages, in, gaining, insight, into, human, language, speculations, of, the, existence, of, a, logical, general, or, universal, grammar, underlying, all, languages, were, published, in, the, middle, ages, especially, by, the, modistae, school, at, the, time, latin, was, the, model, language, of, linguistics, although, transcribing, irish, and, icelandic, into, the, latin, alphabet, was, found, problematic, the, cross, linguistic, dimension, of, linguistics, was, established, in, the, renaissance, period, for, example, grammaticae, quadrilinguis, partitiones, 1544, by, johannes, drosaeus, compared, french, and, the, three, holy, languages, hebrew, greek, and, latin, the, approach, was, expanded, by, the, port, royal, grammar, 1660, of, antoine, arnauld, and, claude, lancelot, who, added, spanish, italian, german, and, arabic, nicolas, beauz, e, s, 1767, book, includes, examples, of, english, swedish, lappish, irish, welsh, basque, quechua, and, chinese, the, conquest, and, conversion, of, the, world, by, europeans, gave, rise, to, missionary, linguistics, producing, first, hand, word, lists, and, grammatical, descriptions, of, exotic, languages, such, work, is, accounted, for, in, the, catalogue, of, the, languages, of, the, populations, we, know, 1800, by, the, spanish, jesuit, lorenzo, herv, s, johann, christoph, adelung, collected, the, first, large, language, sample, with, the, lord, s, prayer, in, almost, five, hundred, languages, posthumous, 1817, more, developed, nineteenth, century, comparative, works, include, franz, bopp, s, conjugation, system, 1816, and, wilhelm, von, humboldt, s, on, the, difference, in, human, linguistic, structure, and, its, influence, on, the, intellectual, development, of, mankind, posthumous, 1836, in, 1818, august, wilhelm, schlegel, made, a, classification, of, the, world, s, languages, into, three, types, i, languages, lacking, grammatical, structure, e, g, chinese, ii, agglutinative, languages, e, g, turkish, and, iii, inflectional, languages, which, can, be, synthetic, like, latin, and, ancient, greek, or, analytic, like, french, this, idea, was, later, developed, by, others, including, august, schleicher, heymann, steinthal, franz, misteli, franz, nicolaus, finck, and, max, m, ller, the, word, typology, was, proposed, by, georg, von, der, gabelentz, in, his, sprachwissenschaft, 1891, louis, hjelmslev, proposed, typology, as, a, large, scale, empirical, analytical, endeavour, of, comparing, grammatical, features, to, uncover, the, essence, of, language, such, a, project, begins, from, the, 1961, conference, on, language, universals, at, dobbs, ferry, speakers, included, roman, jakobson, charles, f, hockett, and, joseph, greenberg, who, proposed, forty, five, different, types, of, linguistic, universals, based, on, his, data, sets, from, thirty, languages, greenberg, s, findings, were, mostly, known, from, the, nineteenth, century, grammarians, but, his, systematic, presentation, of, them, would, serve, as, a, model, for, modern, typology, winfred, p, lehmann, introduced, greenbergian, typological, theory, to, indo, european, studies, in, the, 1970s, during, the, twentieth, century, typology, based, on, missionary, linguistics, became, centered, around, sil, international, which, today, hosts, its, catalogue, of, living, languages, ethnologue, as, an, online, database, the, greenbergian, or, universalist, approach, is, accounted, for, by, the, world, atlas, of, language, structures, among, others, typology, is, also, done, within, the, frameworks, of, functional, grammar, including, functional, discourse, grammar, role, and, reference, grammar, and, systemic, functional, linguistics, during, the, early, years, of, the, twenty, first, century, however, the, existence, of, linguistic, universals, became, questioned, by, linguists, proposing, evolutionary, typology, quantitative, typology, deals, with, the, distribution, and, co, occurrence, of, structural, patterns, in, the, languages, of, the, world, major, types, of, non, chance, distribution, include, linguistic, universals, are, patterns, that, can, be, seen, cross, linguistically, universals, can, either, be, absolute, meaning, that, every, documented, language, exhibits, this, characteristic, or, statistical, meaning, that, this, characteristic, is, seen, in, most, languages, or, is, probable, in, most, languages, universals, both, absolute, and, statistical, can, be, unrestricted, meaning, that, they, apply, to, most, or, all, languages, without, any, additional, conditions, conversely, both, absolute, and, statistical, universals, can, be, restricted, or, implicational, meaning, that, a, characteristic, will, be, true, on, the, condition, of, something, else, if, y, characteristic, is, true, then, x, characteristic, is, true, an, example, of, an, implicational, hierarchy, is, that, dual, pronouns, are, only, found, in, languages, with, plural, pronouns, while, singular, pronouns, or, unspecified, in, terms, of, number, are, found, in, all, languages, the, implicational, hierarchy, is, thus, singular, plural, dual, etc, qualitative, typology, develops, cross, linguistically, viable, notions, or, types, that, provide, a, framework, for, the, description, and, comparison, of, languages, the, main, subfields, of, linguistic, typology, include, the, empirical, fields, of, syntactic, phonological, and, lexical, typology, additionally, theoretical, typology, aims, to, explain, the, empirical, findings, especially, statistical, tendencies, or, implicational, hierarchies, syntactic, typology, studies, a, vast, array, of, grammatical, phenomena, from, the, languages, of, the, world, two, well, known, issues, include, dominant, order, and, left, right, symmetry, one, set, of, types, reflects, the, basic, order, of, subject, verb, and, direct, object, in, sentences, these, labels, usually, appear, abbreviated, as, svo, and, so, forth, and, may, be, called, typologies, of, the, languages, to, which, they, apply, the, most, commonly, attested, word, orders, are, sov, and, svo, while, the, least, common, orders, are, those, that, are, object, initial, with, ovs, being, the, least, common, with, only, four, attested, instances, in, the, 1980s, linguists, began, to, question, the, relevance, of, geographical, distribution, of, different, values, for, various, features, of, linguistic, structure, they, may, have, wanted, to, discover, whether, a, particular, grammatical, structure, found, in, one, language, is, likewise, found, in, another, language, in, the, same, geographic, location, some, languages, split, verbs, into, an, auxiliary, and, an, infinitive, or, participle, and, put, the, subject, and, or, object, between, them, for, instance, german, ich, habe, einen, fuchs, im, wald, gesehen, i, have, a, fox, in, the, woods, seen, dutch, hans, vermoedde, dat, jan, marie, zag, leren, zwemmen, hans, suspected, that, jan, marie, saw, to, learn, to, swim, and, welsh, mae, r, gwirio, sillafu, wedi, i, gwblhau, is, the, checking, spelling, after, its, to, complete, in, this, case, linguists, base, the, typology, on, the, non, analytic, tenses, i, e, those, sentences, in, which, the, verb, is, not, split, or, on, the, position, of, the, auxiliary, german, is, thus, svo, in, main, clauses, and, welsh, is, vso, and, preposition, phrases, would, go, after, the, infinitive, many, typologists, classify, both, german, and, dutch, as, v2, languages, as, the, verb, invariantly, occurs, as, the, second, element, of, a, full, clause, some, languages, allow, varying, degrees, of, freedom, in, their, constituent, order, posing, a, problem, for, their, classification, within, the, subject, verb, object, schema, languages, with, bound, case, markings, for, nouns, for, example, tend, to, have, more, flexible, word, orders, than, languages, where, case, is, defined, by, position, within, a, sentence, or, presence, of, a, preposition, for, example, in, some, languages, with, bound, case, markings, for, nouns, such, as, language, x, varying, degrees, of, freedom, in, constituent, order, are, observed, these, languages, exhibit, more, flexible, word, orders, allowing, for, variations, like, subject, verb, object, svo, structure, as, in, the, cat, ate, the, mouse, and, object, subject, verb, osv, structure, as, in, the, mouse, the, cat, ate, to, define, a, basic, constituent, order, type, in, this, case, one, generally, looks, at, frequency, of, different, types, in, declarative, affirmative, main, clauses, in, pragmatically, neutral, contexts, preferably, with, only, old, referents, thus, for, instance, russian, is, widely, considered, an, svo, language, as, this, is, the, most, frequent, constituent, order, under, such, conditions, all, sorts, of, variations, are, possible, though, and, occur, in, texts, in, many, inflected, languages, such, as, russian, latin, and, greek, departures, from, the, default, word, orders, are, permissible, but, usually, imply, a, shift, in, focus, an, emphasis, on, the, final, element, or, some, special, context, in, the, poetry, of, these, languages, the, word, order, may, also, shift, freely, to, meet, metrical, demands, additionally, freedom, of, word, order, may, vary, within, the, same, language, for, example, formal, literary, or, archaizing, varieties, may, have, different, stricter, or, more, lenient, constituent, order, structures, than, an, informal, spoken, variety, of, the, same, language, on, the, other, hand, when, there, is, no, clear, preference, under, the, described, conditions, the, language, is, considered, to, have, flexible, constituent, order, a, type, unto, itself, an, additional, problem, is, that, in, languages, without, living, speech, communities, such, as, latin, ancient, greek, and, old, church, slavonic, linguists, have, only, written, evidence, perhaps, written, in, a, poetic, formalizing, or, archaic, style, that, mischaracterizes, the, actual, daily, use, of, the, language, the, daily, spoken, language, of, sophocles, or, cicero, might, have, exhibited, a, different, or, much, more, regular, syntax, than, their, written, legacy, indicates, the, below, table, indicates, the, distribution, of, the, dominant, word, order, pattern, of, over, 5, 000, individual, languages, and, 366, language, families, sov, is, the, most, common, type, in, both, although, much, more, clearly, in, the, data, of, language, families, including, isolates, nodom, represents, languages, without, a, single, dominant, order, though, the, reason, of, dominance, is, sometimes, considered, an, unsolved, or, unsolvable, typological, problem, several, explanations, for, the, distribution, pattern, have, been, proposed, evolutionary, explanations, include, those, by, thomas, givon, 1979, who, suggests, that, all, languages, stem, from, an, sov, language, but, are, evolving, into, different, kinds, and, by, derek, bickerton, 1981, who, argues, that, the, original, language, was, svo, which, supports, simpler, grammar, employing, word, order, instead, of, case, markers, to, differentiate, between, clausal, roles, universalist, explanations, include, a, model, by, russell, tomlin, 1986, based, on, three, functional, principles, i, animate, before, inanimate, ii, theme, before, comment, and, iii, verb, object, bonding, the, three, way, model, roughly, predicts, the, real, hierarchy, see, table, above, assuming, no, statistical, difference, between, sov, and, svo, and, also, no, statistical, difference, between, vos, and, ovs, by, contrast, the, processing, efficiency, theory, of, john, a, hawkins, 1994, suggests, that, constituents, are, ordered, from, shortest, to, longest, in, vo, languages, and, from, longest, to, shortest, in, ov, languages, giving, rise, to, the, attested, distribution, this, approach, relies, on, the, notion, that, ov, languages, have, heavy, subjects, and, vo, languages, have, heavy, objects, which, is, disputed, a, second, major, way, of, syntactic, categorization, is, by, excluding, the, subject, from, consideration, it, is, a, well, documented, typological, feature, that, languages, with, a, dominant, ov, order, object, before, verb, japanese, for, example, tend, to, have, postpositions, in, contrast, vo, languages, verb, before, object, like, english, tend, to, have, prepositions, as, their, main, adpositional, type, several, ov, vo, correlations, have, been, uncovered, several, processing, explanations, were, proposed, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, for, the, above, correlations, they, suggest, that, the, brain, finds, it, easier, to, parse, syntactic, patterns, that, are, either, right, or, left, branching, but, not, mixed, the, most, widely, held, such, explanation, is, john, a, hawkins, parsing, efficiency, theory, which, argues, that, language, is, a, non, innate, adaptation, to, innate, cognitive, mechanisms, typological, tendencies, are, considered, as, being, based, on, language, users, preference, for, grammars, that, are, organized, efficiently, and, on, their, avoidance, of, word, orderings, that, cause, processing, difficulty, hawkins, s, processing, theory, predicts, the, above, table, but, also, makes, predictions, for, non, correlation, pairs, including, the, order, of, adjective, demonstrative, and, numeral, in, respect, with, the, noun, this, theory, was, based, on, corpus, research, and, lacks, support, in, psycholinguistic, studies, some, languages, exhibit, regular, inefficient, patterning, these, include, the, vo, languages, chinese, with, the, adpositional, phrase, before, the, verb, and, finnish, which, has, postpositions, but, there, are, few, other, profoundly, exceptional, languages, it, is, suggested, more, recently, that, the, left, right, orientation, is, limited, to, role, marking, connectives, adpositions, and, subordinators, stemming, directly, from, the, semantic, mapping, of, the, sentence, since, the, true, correlation, pairs, in, the, above, table, either, involve, such, a, connective, or, arguably, follow, from, the, canonical, order, orientation, predicts, them, without, making, problematic, claims, another, common, classification, distinguishes, nominative, accusative, alignment, patterns, and, ergative, absolutive, ones, in, a, language, with, cases, the, classification, depends, on, whether, the, subject, s, of, an, intransitive, verb, has, the, same, case, as, the, agent, a, or, the, patient, p, of, a, transitive, verb, if, a, language, has, no, cases, but, the, word, order, is, avp, or, pva, then, a, classification, may, reflect, whether, the, subject, of, an, intransitive, verb, appears, on, the, same, side, as, the, agent, or, the, patient, of, the, transitive, verb, bickel, 2011, has, argued, that, alignment, should, be, seen, as, a, construction, specific, property, rather, than, a, language, specific, property, many, languages, show, mixed, accusative, and, ergative, behaviour, for, example, ergative, morphology, marking, the, verb, arguments, on, top, of, an, accusative, syntax, other, languages, called, active, languages, have, two, types, of, intransitive, verbs, some, of, them, active, verbs, join, the, subject, in, the, same, case, as, the, agent, of, a, transitive, verb, and, the, rest, stative, verbs, join, the, subject, in, the, same, case, as, the, patient, yet, other, languages, behave, ergatively, only, in, some, contexts, this, split, ergativity, is, often, based, on, the, grammatical, person, of, the, arguments, or, on, the, tense, aspect, of, the, verb, for, example, only, some, verbs, in, georgian, behave, this, way, and, as, a, rule, only, while, using, the, perfective, aorist, linguistic, typology, also, seeks, to, identify, patterns, in, the, structure, and, distribution, of, sound, systems, among, the, world, s, languages, this, is, accomplished, by, surveying, and, analyzing, the, relative, frequencies, of, different, phonological, properties, exemplary, relative, frequencies, are, given, below, for, certain, speech, sounds, formed, by, obstructing, airflow, obstruents, these, relative, frequencies, show, that, contrastive, voicing, commonly, occurs, with, plosives, as, in, english, neat, and, need, but, occurs, much, more, rarely, among, fricatives, such, as, the, english, niece, and, knees, according, to, a, worldwide, sample, of, 637, languages, 62, have, the, voicing, contrast, in, stops, but, only, 35, have, this, in, fricatives, in, the, vast, majority, of, those, cases, the, absence, of, voicing, contrast, occurs, because, there, is, a, lack, of, voiced, fricatives, and, because, all, languages, have, some, form, of, plosive, occlusive, but, there, are, languages, with, no, fricatives, below, is, a, chart, showing, the, breakdown, of, voicing, properties, among, languages, in, the, aforementioned, sample, languages, worldwide, also, vary, in, the, number, of, sounds, they, use, these, languages, can, go, from, very, small, phonemic, inventories, rotokas, with, six, consonants, and, five, vowels, to, very, large, inventories, x, with, 128, consonants, and, 28, vowels, an, interesting, phonological, observation, found, with, this, data, is, that, the, larger, a, consonant, inventory, a, language, has, the, more, likely, it, is, to, contain, a, sound, from, a, defined, set, of, complex, consonants, clicks, glottalized, consonants, doubly, articulated, labial, velar, stops, lateral, fricatives, and, affricates, uvular, and, pharyngeal, consonants, and, dental, or, alveolar, non, sibilant, fricatives, of, this, list, only, about, 26, of, languages, in, a, survey, of, over, 600, with, small, inventories, less, than, 19, consonants, contain, a, member, of, this, set, while, 51, of, average, languages, 19, 25, contain, at, least, one, member, and, 69, of, large, consonant, inventories, greater, than, 25, consonants, contain, a, member, of, this, set, it, is, then, seen, that, complex, consonants, are, in, proportion, to, the, size, of, the, inventory, vowels, contain, a, more, modest, number, of, phonemes, with, the, average, being, 5, 6, which, 51, of, the, languages, in, the, survey, have, about, a, third, of, the, languages, have, larger, than, average, vowel, inventories, most, interesting, though, is, the, lack, of, relationship, between, consonant, inventory, size, and, vowel, inventory, size, below, is, a, chart, showing, this, lack, of, predictability, between, consonant, and, vowel, inventory, sizes, in, relation, to, each, other
