common, characteristics, mission, or, disciplinary, focus, the, college, of, engineering, the, college, of, nursing, and, so, forth, there, exist, other, variants, for, historical, reasons, including, some, uses, that, exist, because, of, mergers, and, acquisitions, for, example, duke, university, which, was, called, trinity, college, until, the, 1920s, still, calls, its, main, undergraduate, subdivision, trinity, college, of, arts, and, sciences, some, american, universities, such, as, princeton, rice, and, yale, have, established, residential, colleges, sometimes, as, at, harvard, the, first, to, establish, such, a, system, in, the, 1930s, known, as, houses, along, the, lines, of, oxford, or, cambridge, unlike, the, oxbridge, colleges, but, similarly, to, durham, these, residential, colleges, are, not, autonomous, legal, entities, nor, are, they, typically, much, involved, in, education, itself, being, primarily, concerned, with, room, board, and, social, life, at, the, university, of, michigan, university, of, california, san, diego, and, the, university, of, california, santa, cruz, each, residential, college, teaches, its, own, core, writing, courses, and, has, its, own, distinctive, set, of, graduation, requirements, many, u, s, universities, have, placed, increased, emphasis, on, their, residential, colleges, in, recent, years, this, is, exemplified, by, the, creation, of, new, colleges, at, ivy, league, schools, such, as, yale, university, and, princeton, university, and, efforts, to, strengthen, the, contribution, of, the, residential, colleges, to, student, education, including, through, a, 2016, taskforce, at, princeton, on, residential, colleges, the, founders, of, the, first, institutions, of, higher, education, in, the, united, states, were, graduates, of, the, university, of, oxford, and, the, university, of, cambridge, the, small, institutions, they, founded, would, not, have, seemed, to, them, like, universities, they, were, tiny, and, did, not, offer, the, higher, degrees, in, medicine, and, theology, furthermore, they, were, not, composed, of, several, small, colleges, instead, the, new, institutions, felt, like, the, oxford, and, cambridge, colleges, they, were, used, to, small, communities, housing, and, feeding, their, students, with, instruction, from, residential, tutors, as, in, the, united, kingdom, described, above, when, the, first, students, graduated, these, colleges, assumed, the, right, to, confer, degrees, upon, them, usually, with, authority, for, example, the, college, of, william, mary, has, a, royal, charter, from, the, british, monarchy, allowing, it, to, confer, degrees, while, dartmouth, college, has, a, charter, permitting, it, to, award, degrees, as, are, usually, granted, in, either, of, the, universities, or, any, other, college, in, our, realm, of, great, britain, the, leaders, of, harvard, college, which, granted, america, s, first, degrees, in, 1642, might, have, thought, of, their, college, as, the, first, of, many, residential, colleges, that, would, grow, up, into, a, new, cambridge, university, however, over, time, few, new, colleges, were, founded, there, and, harvard, grew, and, added, higher, faculties, eventually, it, changed, its, title, to, university, but, the, term, college, had, stuck, and, colleges, have, arisen, across, the, united, states, in, u, s, usage, the, word, college, not, only, embodies, a, particular, type, of, school, but, has, historically, been, used, to, refer, to, the, general, concept, of, higher, education, when, it, is, not, necessary, to, specify, a, school, as, in, going, to, college, or, college, savings, accounts, offered, by, banks, in, a, survey, of, more, than, 2, 000, college, students, in, 33, states, and, 156, different, campuses, the, u, s, public, interest, research, group, found, the, average, student, spends, as, much, as, 1, 200, each, year, on, textbooks, and, supplies, alone, by, comparison, the, group, says, that, s, the, equivalent, of, 39, percent, of, tuition, and, fees, at, a, community, college, and, 14, percent, of, tuition, and, fees, at, a, four, year, public, university, in, addition, to, private, colleges, and, universities, the, u, s, also, has, a, system, of, government, funded, public, universities, many, were, founded, under, the, morrill, land, grant, colleges, act, of, 1862, a, movement, had, arisen, to, bring, a, form, of, more, practical, higher, education, to, the, masses, as, many, politicians, and, educators, wanted, to, make, it, possible, for, all, young, americans, to, receive, some, sort, of, advanced, education, the, morrill, act, made, it, possible, for, the, new, western, states, to, establish, colleges, for, the, citizens, its, goal, was, to, make, higher, education, more, easily, accessible, to, the, citizenry, of, the, country, specifically, to, improve, agricultural, systems, by, providing, training, and, scholarship, in, the, production, and, sales, of, agricultural, products, and, to, provide, formal, education, in, agriculture, home, economics, mechanical, arts, and, other, professions, that, seemed, practical, at, the, time, the, act, was, eventually, extended, to, allow, all, states, that, had, remained, with, the, union, during, the, american, civil, war, and, eventually, all, states, to, establish, such, institutions, most, of, the, colleges, established, under, the, morrill, act, have, since, become, full, universities, and, some, are, among, the, elite, of, the, world, selection, of, a, four, year, college, as, compared, to, a, two, year, junior, college, even, by, marginal, students, such, as, those, with, a, c, grade, average, in, high, school, and, sat, scores, in, the, mid, 800s, increases,
