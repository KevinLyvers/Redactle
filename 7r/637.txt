a, political, campaign, is, an, organized, effort, which, seeks, to, influence, the, decision, making, progress, within, a, specific, group, in, democracies, political, campaigns, often, refer, to, electoral, campaigns, by, which, representatives, are, chosen, or, referendums, are, decided, in, modern, politics, the, most, high, profile, political, campaigns, are, focused, on, general, elections, and, candidates, for, head, of, state, or, head, of, government, often, a, president, or, prime, minister, the, message, of, the, campaign, contains, the, ideas, that, the, candidate, wants, to, share, with, the, voters, it, is, to, get, those, who, agree, with, their, ideas, to, support, them, when, running, for, a, political, position, the, message, often, consists, of, several, talking, points, about, policy, issues, the, points, summarize, the, main, ideas, of, the, campaign, and, are, repeated, frequently, in, order, to, create, a, lasting, impression, with, the, voters, in, many, elections, the, opposition, party, will, try, to, get, the, candidate, off, message, by, bringing, up, policy, or, personal, questions, that, are, not, related, to, the, talking, points, most, campaigns, prefer, to, keep, the, message, broad, in, order, to, attract, the, most, potential, voters, a, message, that, is, too, narrow, can, alienate, voters, or, slow, the, candidate, down, with, explaining, details, for, example, in, the, 2008, american, presidential, election, john, mccain, originally, used, a, message, that, focused, on, his, patriotism, and, political, experience, country, first, later, the, message, was, changed, to, shift, attention, to, his, role, as, the, original, maverick, within, the, political, establishment, barack, obama, ran, on, a, consistent, simple, message, of, change, throughout, his, campaign, fundraising, techniques, include, having, the, candidate, call, or, meet, with, large, donors, sending, direct, mail, pleas, to, small, donors, and, courting, interest, groups, who, could, end, up, spending, millions, on, the, race, if, it, is, significant, to, their, interests, in, a, modern, political, campaign, the, campaign, organization, or, machine, will, have, a, coherent, structure, of, personnel, in, the, same, manner, as, any, business, of, similar, size, a, campaign, manager, s, primary, duty, is, to, ensure, marketing, campaigns, achieve, their, objectives, they, work, with, the, marketing, manager, to, create, execute, and, monitor, the, performance, of, campaigns, and, provide, all, the, resources, required, to, meet, sales, targets, political, consultants, advise, campaigns, on, virtually, all, of, their, activities, from, research, to, field, strategy, consultants, conduct, candidate, research, voter, research, and, opposition, research, for, their, clients, in, the, context, of, political, campaigns, activists, are, foot, soldiers, loyal, to, a, campaign, s, cause, as, supporters, they, promote, the, campaign, as, volunteer, activists, such, volunteers, and, interns, may, take, part, in, activities, such, as, canvassing, door, to, door, and, making, phone, calls, on, behalf, of, the, campaigns, a, campaign, team, which, may, be, as, small, as, one, inspired, individual, or, a, heavily, resourced, group, of, professionals, must, consider, how, to, communicate, the, message, of, the, campaign, recruit, volunteers, and, raise, money, campaign, advertising, draws, on, techniques, from, commercial, advertising, and, propaganda, also, entertainment, and, public, relations, a, mixture, dubbed, politainment, the, avenues, available, to, political, campaigns, when, distributing, their, messages, is, limited, by, the, law, available, resources, and, the, imagination, of, the, campaigns, participants, these, techniques, are, often, combined, into, a, formal, strategy, known, as, the, campaign, plan, the, plan, takes, account, of, a, campaign, s, goal, message, target, audience, and, resources, available, the, campaign, will, typically, seek, to, identify, supporters, at, the, same, time, as, getting, its, message, across, the, modern, open, campaign, method, was, pioneered, by, aaron, burr, during, the, american, presidential, election, of, 1800, another, modern, campaign, method, by, political, scientist, joel, bradshaw, points, out, four, key, propositions, for, developing, a, successful, campaign, strategy, first, in, any, election, the, electorate, can, be, divided, into, three, groups, the, candidate, s, base, the, opponent, s, base, and, the, undecided, second, past, election, results, data, from, registered, voter, lists, and, survey, research, make, it, possible, to, determine, which, people, fall, into, each, of, these, three, groups, third, it, is, neither, possible, nor, necessary, to, get, the, support, of, all, people, fourth, and, last, once, a, campaign, has, identified, how, to, win, it, can, act, to, create, the, circumstances, to, bring, about, this, victory, in, order, to, succeed, campaigns, should, direct, campaign, resources, money, time, and, message, to, key, groups, of, potential, voters, and, nowhere, else, election, campaign, communication, refers, to, party, controlled, communication, e, g, campaign, advertising, and, party, uncontrolled, communication, e, g, media, coverage, of, elections, campaign, advertising, is, the, use, of, paid, media, newspapers, radio, television, etc, to, influence, the, decisions, made, for, and, by, groups, these, ads, are, designed, by, political, consultants, and, the, campaign, s, staff, media, management, refers, to, the, ability, of, a, political, campaign, to, control, the, message, that, it, broadcasts, to, the, public, the, forms, of, media, used, in, political, campaigns, can, be, classified, into, two, distinct, categories, paid, media, or, earned, media, paid, media, refers, to, any, media, attention, that, is, directly, generated, from, spending, this, form, of, media, is, commonly, found, through, political, advertisements, and, organized, events, an, advantage, of, paid, media, is, that, it, allows, political, campaigns, to, tailor, the, messages, they, show, the, public, and, control, when, the, public, sees, them, campaigns, often, prioritize, spending, in, contested, regions, and, increase, their, paid, media, expenses, as, an, election, approaches, electoral, campaigns, often, conclude, with, a, closing, argument, ad, an, advertisement, that, summarizes, the, campaign, s, core, themes, and, explains, the, candidate, s, vision, for, the, future, in, the, 2020, election, joe, biden, s, rising, ad, starts, with, him, saying, we, re, in, a, battle, for, the, soul, of, this, nation, and, a, worker, in, donald, trump, s, pennsylvania, ad, stated, that, will, be, the, end, of, my, job, and, thousands, of, others, if, trump, lost, earned, media, describes, free, media, coverage, often, from, news, stories, or, social, media, posts, unlike, paid, media, earned, media, does, not, incur, an, expense, to, the, campaign, earned, media, does, not, imply, that, the, political, campaign, is, mentioned, in, a, positive, manner, political, campaigns, may, often, receive, earned, media, from, gaffes, or, scandals, in, the, 2016, united, states, presidential, election, a, majority, of, the, media, coverage, surrounding, hillary, clinton, was, focused, on, her, scandals, with, the, most, prevalent, topics, being, topics, related, to, her, emails, experts, say, that, effective, media, management, is, an, essential, component, of, a, successful, political, campaign, studies, show, that, candidates, with, higher, media, attention, tend, to, have, greater, success, in, elections, each, form, of, media, can, influence, the, other, paid, media, may, raise, the, newsworthiness, of, an, event, which, could, lead, to, an, increase, in, earned, media, campaigns, may, also, spend, money, to, emphasize, stories, circulating, through, media, networks, research, suggests, that, neither, form, of, media, is, inherently, superior, a, 2009, study, found, that, media, coverage, was, not, significantly, more, effective, than, paid, advertisements, the, internet, is, now, a, core, element, of, modern, political, campaigns, communication, technologies, such, as, e, mail, websites, and, podcasts, for, various, forms, of, activism, enable, faster, communications, by, citizen, movements, and, deliver, a, message, to, a, large, audience, these, internet, technologies, are, used, for, cause, related, fundraising, lobbying, volunteering, community, building, and, organizing, individual, political, candidates, are, also, using, the, internet, to, promote, their, election, campaign, in, a, study, of, norwegian, election, campaigns, politicians, reported, they, used, social, media, for, marketing, and, for, dialogue, with, voters, facebook, was, the, primary, platform, for, marketing, and, twitter, was, used, for, more, continuous, dialogue, signifying, the, importance, of, internet, political, campaigning, barack, obama, s, presidential, campaign, relied, heavily, on, social, media, search, engine, optimisation, seo, and, new, media, channels, to, engage, voters, recruit, campaign, volunteers, and, raise, campaign, funds, the, campaign, brought, the, spotlight, on, the, importance, of, using, internet, in, new, age, political, campaigning, by, utilizing, various, forms, of, social, media, and, new, media, including, facebook, youtube, and, a, custom, generated, social, engine, to, reach, new, target, populations, the, campaign, s, social, website, my, barackobama, com, utilized, a, low, cost, and, efficient, method, of, mobilizing, voters, and, increasing, participation, among, various, voter, populations, this, new, media, was, incredibly, successful, at, reaching, the, younger, population, while, helping, all, populations, organize, and, promote, action, now, online, election, campaign, information, can, be, shared, in, a, rich, information, format, through, campaign, landing, pages, integrating, google, s, rich, snippets, structured, data, social, media, open, graphs, and, husting, support, file, formats, for, youtube, like, sbv, srt, and, vtt, high, proficiency, and, effective, algorithmic, integration, will, be, the, core, factor, in, the, framework, this, technology, integration, helps, campaign, information, reach, a, wide, audience, in, split, seconds, this, was, successfully, tested, and, implemented, in, the, 2015, aruvikkara, election, and, the, 2020, kerala, elections, marcus, giavanni, social, media, consultant, blockchain, developer, and, second, place, opponent, in, the, 2015, denver, mayoral, election, was, first, to, file, for, the, 2019, election, marcus, giavanni, used, advanced, algorithms, artificial, intelligence, and, voice, indexing, predictions, to, box, in, campaigns, a, husting, or, the, hustings, was, originally, a, physical, platform, from, which, representatives, presented, their, views, or, cast, votes, before, a, parliamentary, or, other, election, body, by, metonymy, the, term, may, now, refer, to, any, event, such, as, debates, or, speeches, during, an, election, campaign, where, one, or, more, of, the, representative, candidates, are, present, an, informational, campaign, is, a, political, campaign, designed, to, raise, public, awareness, and, support, for, the, positions, of, a, candidate, or, her, his, party, it, is, more, intense, than, a, paper, campaign, which, consists, of, little, more, than, filing, the, necessary, papers, to, get, on, the, ballot, but, is, less, intense, than, a, competitive, campaign, which, aims, to, actually, win, election, to, the, office, an, informational, campaign, typically, focuses, on, low, cost, outreach, such, as, news, releases, getting, interviewed, in, the, paper, making, a, brochure, for, door, to, door, distribution, organizing, poll, workers, etc, a, paper, campaign, is, a, political, campaign, in, which, the, candidate, only, files, the, necessary, paperwork, to, appear, on, the, ballot, the, purpose, of, such, a, token, effort, may, be, simply, to, increase, name, awareness, of, a, minor, political, party, to, give, voters, of, a, certain, ideology, an, opportunity, to, vote, accordingly, or, to, ensure, that, the, party, has, candidates, in, every, constituency, it, can, be, a, cost, effective, means, of, attracting, media, coverage, an, informational, campaign, by, contrast, may, involve, news, releases, newspaper, interviews, door, to, door, campaigning, and, organizing, polls, as, the, level, of, seriousness, rises, the, marginal, cost, of, reaching, more, people, rises, accordingly, due, to, the, high, cost, of, tv, commercials, paid, staff, etc, which, are, used, by, competitive, campaigns, paper, candidates, do, not, expect, to, be, elected, and, usually, run, simply, as, a, way, of, helping, the, more, general, campaign, however, an, unexpected, surge, in, support, for, the, party, may, result, in, many, paper, candidates, being, unexpectedly, elected, as, for, example, happened, to, the, new, democratic, party, in, quebec, during, the, 2011, federal, election, a, 2018, study, in, the, american, political, science, review, found, that, campaigns, have, an, average, effect, of, zero, in, general, elections, the, study, found, two, instances, where, campaigning, was, effective, first, when, candidates, take, unusually, unpopular, positions, and, campaigns, invest, unusually, heavily, in, identifying, persuadable, voters, second, when, campaigns, contact, voters, long, before, election, day, and, measure, effects, immediately, although, this, early, persuasion, decays, one, reason, why, it, is, hard, to, judge, the, effectiveness, of, an, election, campaign, is, because, many, people, know, who, they, want, to, vote, for, long, before, the, campaigns, are, started, voters, are, more, likely, to, vote, for, a, nominee, based, on, whose, values, align, closest, with, theirs, studies, suggest, that, party, flips, come, from, the, analysis, of, how, a, voter, sees, their, parties, performance, in, the, years, before, a, campaign, even, begins, another, study, suggests, that, at, the, 2017, austrian, legislative, election, 31, of, voters, admitted, to, either, developing, of, changing, their, party, preferences, during, the, election, campaign, the, study, provides, data, that, shows, how, the, main, parties, within, austria, had, differing, levels, of, voters, flipping, toward, them, thus, proving, that, an, election, campaign, has, some, level, of, effectiveness, that, differs, between, parties, depending, on, factors, such, as, media, presence, in, presidential, campaigns, in, the, united, states, research, indicates, that, a, 10, million, advantage, in, spending, in, an, individual, states, leads, to, approximately, 27, 000, more, votes, for, the, campaign, in, the, state, which, can, be, sufficient, to, win, a, close, race, in, down, ballot, races, spending, matters, more, scholars, have, estimated, that, a, 2, million, advantage, can, net, a, senate, campaign, 10, 000, votes, a, large, body, of, political, science, research, emphasizes, how, fundamentals, the, state, of, the, economy, whether, the, country, is, at, war, how, long, the, president, s, party, has, held, the, office, and, which, candidate, is, more, ideologically, moderate, predict, presidential, election, outcomes, however, campaigns, may, be, necessary, to, enlighten, otherwise, uninformed, voters, about, the, fundamentals, which, thus, become, increasingly, predictive, of, preferences, as, the, campaign, progresses, research, suggests, that, the, 2012, presidential, campaigns, increased, turnout, in, highly, targeted, states, by, 7, 8, percentage, points, on, average, indicating, that, modern, campaigns, can, significantly, alter, the, size, and, composition, of, the, voting, population, a, consensus, in, the, political, science, literature, holds, that, national, conventions, usually, have, a, measurable, effect, on, presidential, elections, that, is, relatively, resistant, to, decay, research, is, mixed, on, the, precise, impact, of, debates, rather, than, encourage, viewers, to, update, their, political, views, in, accordance, with, the, most, persuasive, arguments, viewers, instead, update, their, views, to, merely, reflect, what, their, favored, candidate, is, saying, the, fundamentals, matter, less, in, the, outcome, of, presidential, primaries, one, prominent, theory, holds, that, the, outcome, of, presidential, primaries, is, largely, determined, by, the, preferences, of, party, elites, presidential, primaries, are, therefore, less, predictive, as, various, types, of, events, may, impact, elites, perception, of, the, viability, of, candidates, gaffes, debates, and, media, narratives, play, a, greater, role, in, primaries, than, in, presidential, elections, traditional, ground, campaigning, and, voter, contacts, remain, the, most, effective, strategies, some, research, suggests, that, knocking, on, doors, can, increase, turnout, by, as, much, as, 10, and, phone, calls, by, as, much, as, 4, one, study, suggests, that, lawn, signs, increase, vote, share, by, 1, 7, percentage, points, a, review, of, more, than, 200, get, out, the, vote, experiments, finds, that, the, most, effective, tactics, are, personal, door, to, door, canvassing, increases, turnout, by, an, average, of, about, 2, 5, percentage, points, volunteer, phone, calls, raise, it, by, about, 1, 9, points, compared, to, 1, 0, points, for, calls, from, commercial, phone, banks, automated, phone, messages, are, ineffective, using, out, of, state, volunteers, for, canvassing, is, less, effective, in, increasing, turnout, than, using, local, and, trained, volunteers, according, to, political, scientists, donald, green, and, alan, gerber, it, costs, 31, to, produce, a, vote, going, door, to, door, 91, 137, to, produce, a, vote, by, sending, out, direct, mailers, 47, per, vote, from, leafletting, 58, 125, per, vote, from, commercial, phone, banking, and, 20, 35, per, vote, from, voluntary, phone, banking, a, 2018, study, in, the, american, economic, review, found, that, door, to, door, canvassing, on, behalf, of, the, francois, hollande, campaign, in, the, 2012, french, presidential, election, did, not, affect, turnout, but, increased, hollande, s, vote, share, in, the, first, round, and, accounted, for, one, fourth, of, his, victory, margin, in, the, second, visits, impact, persisted, in, later, elections, suggesting, a, lasting, persuasion, effect, according, to, a, 2018, study, repeated, get, out, the, vote, phone, calls, had, diminishing, effects, but, each, additional, phone, call, increased, the, probability, to, vote, by, 0, 6, 1, 0, percentage, points, another, 2018, study, found, that, party, leaflets, boost, turnout, by, 4, 3, percentage, points, while, canvassing, has, a, small, additional, effect, 0, 6, percentage, points, in, a, united, kingdom, election, a, 2016, study, found, that, visits, by, a, candidate, to, states, have, modest, effects, visits, are, most, effective, in, influencing, press, coverage, at, the, national, level, and, within, battleground, states, visits, effects, on, voters, themselves, however, are, much, more, modest, than, consultants, often, claim, and, visits, appear, to, have, no, effects, outside, the, market, that, hosts, a, visit, the, authors, of, the, study, argue, that, it, would, be, more, effective, for, campaigns, to, go, to, the, pockets, of, the, country, where, wealthy, donors, are, for, fundraising, and, hold, rallies, in, the, populous, states, both, to, attract, national, press, and, raise, funds, a, 2005, study, found, that, campaign, visits, had, no, statistically, significant, effect, after, controlling, for, other, factors, on, voter, turnout, in, the, 1992, 1996, and, 2000, elections, on, the, other, hand, a, 2017, paper, of, the, 1948, presidential, election, provides, strong, evidence, that, candidate, visits, can, influence, electoral, returns, other, research, also, provides, evidence, that, campaign, visits, increase, vote, share, campaigns, may, also, rely, on, strategically, placed, field, offices, to, acquire, votes, the, obama, 2008, campaign, s, extensive, use, of, field, offices, has, been, credited, as, crucial, to, winning, in, the, states, of, indiana, and, north, carolina, each, field, office, that, the, obama, campaign, opened, in, 2012, gave, him, approximately, a, 0, 3, greater, vote, share, according, to, one, study, the, cost, per, vote, by, having, a, field, office, is, 49, 40, according, to, a, 2020, study, campaign, spending, on, messaging, to, voters, affects, voter, support, for, candidates, another, 2020, study, found, that, political, advertising, had, small, effects, regardless, of, context, message, sender, and, receiver, a, 2022, study, found, that, voters, are, persuadable, to, switch, support, for, candidates, when, they, are, exposed, to, new, information, political, science, research, generally, finds, negative, advertisement, which, has, increased, over, time, to, be, ineffective, both, at, reducing, the, support, and, turnout, for, the, opponent, a, 2021, study, in, the, american, political, science, review, found, that, television, campaign, ads, do, affect, election, outcomes, in, particular, in, down, ballot, races, according, to, political, scientists, stephen, ansolabehere, and, shanto, iyengar, negative, ads, do, succeed, at, driving, down, overall, turnout, though, a, 2019, study, of, online, political, advertising, conducted, by, a, party, in, the, 2016, berlin, state, election, campaign, found, that, the, online, ad, campaign, increased, the, party, s, vote, share, by, 0, 7, percentage, points, and, that, factual, ads, were, more, effective, than, emotional, ads, political, campaigns, have, existed, as, long, as, there, have, been, informed, citizens, to, campaign, amongst, democratic, societies, have, regular, election, campaigns, but, political, campaigning, can, occur, on, particular, issues, even, in, non, democracies, so, long, as, freedom, of, expression, is, allowed, often, mass, campaigns, are, started, by, the, less, privileged, or, anti, establishment, viewpoints, as, against, more, powerful, interests, whose, first, resort, is, lobbying, the, phenomenon, of, political, campaigns, are, tightly, tied, to, lobby, groups, and, political, parties, the, first, modern, campaign, is, often, described, as, william, ewart, gladstone, s, midlothian, campaign, in, 1878, 80, although, there, may, be, earlier, recognizably, modern, examples, from, the, 19th, century, the, 1896, william, mckinley, presidential, campaign, laid, the, groundwork, for, modern, campaigns, in, the, 19th, century, american, presidential, candidates, seldom, traveled, or, made, speeches, in, support, of, their, candidacies, through, 1904, only, eight, major, presidential, candidates, did, so, william, henry, harrison, in, 1840, winfield, scott, in, 1852, stephen, a, douglas, in, 1860, horatio, seymour, in, 1868, horace, greeley, in, 1872, james, a, garfield, in, 1880, james, g, blaine, in, 1884, william, jennings, bryan, in, 1896, and, 1900, and, alton, b, parker, in, 1904, whereas, every, major, presidential, candidate, since, then, has, done, so, with, the, sole, exception, of, calvin, coolidge, in, 1924, in, 1896, william, mckinley, recruited, the, help, of, marcus, a, hanna, hanna, devised, a, plan, to, have, voters, come, to, mckinley, mckinley, won, the, race, with, 51, of, the, votes, the, development, of, new, technologies, has, completely, changed, the, way, political, campaigns, are, run, in, the, late, 20th, century, campaigns, shifted, into, television, and, radio, broadcasts, the, early, 2000s, brought, interactive, websites, by, 2008, the, world, of, campaigns, was, available, to, millions, of, people, through, the, internet, and, social, media, programs, 2008, marked, a, new, era, of, digital, elections, because, of, the, fast, paced, movement, of, information
