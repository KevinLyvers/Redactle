armoured, warfare, or, armored, warfare, american, english, see, spelling, differences, is, the, use, of, armoured, fighting, vehicles, in, modern, warfare, it, is, a, major, component, of, modern, methods, of, war, the, premise, of, armored, warfare, rests, on, the, ability, of, troops, to, penetrate, conventional, defensive, lines, through, use, of, manoeuvre, by, armoured, units, much, of, the, application, of, armoured, warfare, depends, on, the, use, of, tanks, and, related, vehicles, used, by, other, supporting, arms, such, as, infantry, fighting, vehicles, self, propelled, artillery, and, other, combat, vehicles, as, well, as, mounted, combat, engineers, and, other, support, units, the, doctrine, of, armored, warfare, was, developed, to, break, the, static, nature, of, world, war, i, trench, warfare, on, the, western, front, and, return, to, the, 19th, century, school, of, thought, that, advocated, manoeuvre, and, decisive, battle, outcomes, in, military, strategy, modern, armored, warfare, began, during, the, first, world, war, of, 1914, 1918, strategists, wanted, to, break, the, tactical, operational, and, strategic, stalemates, forced, on, commanders, on, the, western, front, by, the, effectiveness, of, entrenched, defensive, infantry, armed, with, machine, guns, known, as, trench, warfare, under, these, conditions, attacks, usually, advanced, very, slowly, and, incurred, massive, casualties, the, developers, of, tanks, aimed, to, return, manoeuvre, to, warfare, and, found, a, practical, way, to, do, so, providing, caterpillar, traction, to, machine, guns, allowing, them, to, overcome, trenches, while, at, the, same, time, offering, them, armour, protection, against, small, arms, as, they, were, moving, britain, and, france, first, developed, tanks, in, 1915, as, a, way, of, navigating, the, barbed, wire, and, other, obstacles, of, no, man, s, land, while, remaining, protected, from, machine, gun, fire, british, mark, i, tanks, first, went, into, action, at, the, somme, on, 15, september, 1916, but, did, not, manage, to, break, the, deadlock, of, trench, warfare, the, first, french, employment, of, tanks, on, 16, april, 1917, using, the, schneider, ca, also, failed, to, live, up, to, expectations, in, the, battle, of, cambrai, november, to, december, 1917, british, tanks, were, more, successful, and, broke, a, german, trenchline, system, the, hindenburg, line, despite, the, generally, unpromising, beginnings, the, military, and, political, leadership, in, both, britain, and, france, during, 1917, backed, large, investment, into, armoured, vehicle, production, this, led, to, a, sharp, increase, in, the, number, of, available, tanks, for, 1918, the, german, empire, on, the, contrary, produced, only, a, few, tanks, late, in, the, war, twenty, german, a7v, tanks, were, produced, during, the, entire, conflict, compared, to, over, 4, 400, french, and, over, 2, 500, british, tanks, of, various, kinds, nonetheless, world, war, i, saw, the, first, tank, versus, tank, battle, during, the, second, battle, of, villers, bretonneux, in, april, 1918, when, a, group, of, three, german, a7v, tanks, engaged, a, group, of, three, british, mark, iv, tanks, which, they, met, accidentally, after, the, final, german, spring, offensives, of, 21, march, to, 18, july, 1918, the, entente, deployed, tanks, en, masse, at, the, battle, of, soissons, 18, to, 22, july, 1918, and, battle, of, amiens, august, 1918, which, ended, the, stalemate, imposed, by, trench, warfare, on, the, western, front, and, thus, effectively, ended, the, war, tactically, deployment, plans, for, armour, during, the, war, typically, placed, a, strong, emphasis, on, direct, support, for, infantry, the, tank, s, main, tasks, were, seen, as, crushing, barbed, wire, and, destroying, machine, gun, nests, facilitating, the, advance, of, foot, soldiers, theoretical, debate, largely, focused, on, the, question, of, whether, to, use, a, swarm, of, light, tanks, for, this, or, a, limited, number, of, potent, heavy, vehicles, though, in, the, battle, of, cambrai, a, large, concentration, of, british, heavy, tanks, effected, a, breakthrough, it, was, not, exploited, by, armour, the, manoeuvrability, of, the, tank, should, at, least, in, theory, regain, armies, the, ability, to, flank, enemy, lines, in, practice, tank, warfare, during, most, of, world, war, i, was, hampered, by, the, technical, immaturity, of, the, new, weapon, system, limiting, speed, operational, range, and, reliability, and, a, lack, of, effective, armoured, tactics, strategic, use, of, tanks, developed, only, slowly, during, and, immediately, after, world, war, i, partly, due, to, these, technical, limits, but, also, due, to, the, prestige, role, traditionally, accorded, to, horse, mounted, cavalry, an, exception, on, paper, was, the, plan, 1919, of, the, british, army, s, colonel, j, f, c, fuller, who, envisaged, using, the, expected, vast, increase, in, armour, production, during, 1919, to, execute, deep, strategic, penetrations, by, mechanised, forces, consisting, of, tanks, and, infantry, carried, by, trucks, supported, by, aeroplanes, to, paralyse, the, enemy, command, structure, following, the, first, world, war, the, technical, and, doctrinal, aspects, of, armoured, warfare, became, more, sophisticated, and, diverged, into, multiple, schools, of, doctrinal, thought, during, the, 1920s, a, very, limited, number, of, tanks, were, produced, there, were, however, important, theoretical, and, technical, developments, various, british, and, french, commanders, who, had, contributed, to, the, origin, of, the, tank, such, as, jean, baptiste, eug, ne, estienne, b, h, liddell, hart, and, j, f, c, fuller, theorised, about, a, possible, future, use, of, independent, armoured, forces, containing, a, large, concentration, of, tanks, to, execute, deep, strategic, penetrations, especially, liddell, hart, wrote, many, books, about, the, subject, partly, propagating, fuller, s, theories, such, doctrines, were, faced, with, the, reality, that, during, the, 1920s, the, armoured, vehicles, as, early, road, transport, in, general, were, extremely, unreliable, and, could, not, be, used, in, sustained, operations, mainstream, thought, on, the, subject, was, more, conservative, and, tried, to, integrate, armoured, vehicles, into, the, existing, infantry, and, cavalry, organisation, and, tactics, technical, development, initially, focussed, on, the, improvement, of, the, suspension, system, transmission, and, engine, to, create, vehicles, that, were, faster, more, reliable, and, had, a, better, range, than, their, ww, i, predecessors, to, save, weight, such, designs, had, thin, armour, plating, and, this, inspired, fitting, small, calibre, high, velocity, guns, in, turrets, giving, tanks, a, good, antitank, capacity, both, france, and, britain, eventually, built, specialised, infantry, tanks, more, heavily, armoured, to, provide, infantry, support, and, cavalry, tanks, that, were, faster, and, could, exploit, a, breakthrough, seeking, to, bring, about, defeat, of, the, enemy, by, severing, his, lines, of, communication, and, supply, as, cavalry, had, done, during, the, previous, century, the, british, were, the, first, to, create, a, larger, fully, mechanised, unit, when, the, war, office, sanctioned, the, creation, of, the, experimental, mechanized, force, which, was, formed, on, 1, may, 1927, under, infantry, colonel, r, j, collins, after, fuller, was, refused, the, function, its, sub, units, were, entirely, mobile, and, consisted, of, reconnaissance, tankettes, and, armoured, cars, a, battalion, of, forty, eight, vickers, medium, mark, i, tanks, a, motorised, machine, gun, battalion, a, mechanised, artillery, regiment, which, had, one, battery, of, fully, tracked, self, propelled, birch, guns, capable, of, acting, as, conventional, or, anti, aircraft, artillery, and, a, motorised, company, of, field, engineers, the, unit, carried, out, operations, on, salisbury, plain, and, was, observed, by, the, other, major, nations, the, united, states, germany, and, the, soviet, union, although, its, performance, was, recognised, it, was, disbanded, in, 1928, in, 2022, kendrick, kuo, assistant, professor, at, the, u, s, naval, war, college, argued, that, the, british, army, under, budget, and, over, stretched, during, the, interwar, period, pursued, innovation, recklessly, by, betting, on, the, combat, effectiveness, of, armoured, units, operating, with, little, infantry, or, artillery, support, doing, so, led, to, its, initial, setbacks, in, north, africa, during, the, second, world, war, all, major, european, states, with, the, exception, of, germany, that, was, forbidden, to, possess, armoured, vehicles, under, the, treaty, of, versailles, the, us, and, japan, would, create, their, own, experimental, mechanised, forces, during, the, late, 1920s, many, using, either, french, or, british, vehicle, designs, or, even, directly, purchased, vehicles, but, largely, borrowing, from, both, to, develop, their, own, doctrines, during, the, 1930s, political, tensions, between, the, world, powers, quickly, increased, the, soviet, union, and, france, began, to, rearm, in, the, early, thirties, in, the, soviet, union, the, mechanisation, of, the, armed, forces, was, part, of, a, massive, general, industrialisation, programme, the, successive, five, years, plans, and, the, country, soon, had, more, tanks, than, the, rest, of, the, world, combined, thousands, of, them, being, produced, per, year, in, this, period, before, the, rise, to, power, of, the, nazi, party, in, germany, german, officers, were, sent, to, observe, and, participate, in, development, of, armoured, doctrine, in, the, ussr, red, army, and, german, experts, collaborated, in, developing, the, use, of, tanks, based, on, second, generation, vehicles, with, turreted, main, weapons, and, experimenting, to, design, different, chassis, configurations, and, drive, trains, one, important, acquisition, for, the, red, army, turned, out, to, be, the, purchase, of, a, t3, chassis, using, the, christie, suspension, from, us, designer, john, walter, christie, which, served, as, the, basis, of, the, soviet, bt, series, of, fast, tanks, the, red, army, tactics, were, influenced, by, the, theoretical, works, of, marshal, mikhail, tukhachevsky, who, advocated, large, scale, tank, warfare, as, part, of, the, deep, battle, doctrine, in, france, the, second, largest, tank, producer, mechanisation, was, motivated, by, a, need, to, compensate, for, severe, manpower, shortages, due, to, a, collapsed, birth, rate, during, world, war, i, this, led, to, the, development, of, a, vast, range, of, specialised, armoured, vehicles, not, just, tanks, but, also, armoured, cars, self, propelled, guns, mechanised, artillery, armoured, tractors, armoured, supply, vehicles, armoured, artillery, observation, vehicles, armoured, command, vehicles, half, tracks, and, fully, tracked, armoured, personnel, carriers, as, the, mechanisation, progressed, slowly, the, french, armour, doctrine, began, to, reflect, the, increased, capacity, evolving, from, direct, infantry, support, to, independent, breakthrough, and, eventually, envelopment, with, the, infantry, and, to, deep, strategic, exploitation, with, the, cavalry, despite, the, increase, in, tank, numbers, in, all, countries, financial, constraints, prohibited, a, full, mechanisation, of, the, entire, armed, ground, forces, necessarily, most, of, the, divisions, still, consisted, of, infantry, that, was, not, even, motorised, as, a, result, tanks, tended, to, be, allotted, to, special, armoured, units, where, the, limited, and, expensive, expert, maintenance, and, training, capacity, could, be, concentrated, only, the, soviet, union, had, enough, tanks, to, equip, an, organic, tank, battalion, in, each, infantry, division, nevertheless, france, was, the, first, to, create, large, armoured, units, in, 1934, two, mechanised, corps, were, formed, of, 430, tanks, each, in, july, 1935, in, france, the, 4th, cavalry, division, was, transformed, into, the, 1e, division, l, g, re, m, canique, the, first, french, armoured, division, of, the, cavalry, in, germany, after, the, nazi, regime, started, open, rearmament, in, march, 1935, on, 15, october, 1935, three, panzerdivisionen, were, formed, though, some, tank, brigades, were, part, of, the, cavalry, or, infantry, arm, most, german, tanks, were, concentrated, into, a, special, branch, from, 1936, called, the, panzerwaffe, the, precise, interpretation, of, this, phenomenon, has, proven, controversial, among, military, historians, traditionally, it, has, been, seen, as, part, of, a, blitzkrieg, strategy, of, swift, world, conquest, by, means, of, armoured, forces, later, it, has, been, argued, among, others, by, karl, heinz, frieser, that, the, german, army, in, the, 1930s, did, not, even, possess, an, explicit, blitzkrieg, tactical, doctrine, let, alone, strategy, this, would, have, been, reflected, by, the, relatively, unimpressive, rate, of, tank, production, and, development, during, the, 1930s, the, united, kingdom, gave, priority, to, the, royal, air, force, and, royal, navy, the, british, army, began, the, conversion, of, its, cavalry, from, horse, to, tanks, and, all, but, a, few, regiments, were, fully, converted, by, 1939, the, british, 1st, armoured, division, was, formed, as, the, mobile, division, in, november, 1937, before, the, second, world, war, actual, use, of, armoured, fighting, vehicles, was, limited, both, sides, used, italian, german, and, soviet, tanks, during, the, spanish, civil, war, but, these, proved, to, be, vulnerable, to, antitank, guns, due, to, their, thin, armour, traditionalist, elements, within, the, red, army, used, this, to, diminish, the, influence, of, proponents, of, mechanisation, tukhachevsky, himself, was, executed, in, 1937, nevertheless, during, the, soviet, japanese, border, wars, of, 1938, and, 1939, the, soviet, forces, tested, modern, armoured, warfare, tactics, general, georgy, zhukov, in, the, summer, of, 1939, combined, mass, tank, manoeuvres, with, artillery, and, air, attacks, to, defeat, the, japanese, imperial, army, at, the, battles, of, khalkhin, gol, at, nomonhan, in, mongolia, partly, as, a, result, of, the, experiences, in, spain, the, soviet, union, began, the, development, of, a, new, generation, of, medium, and, heavy, tanks, sporting, much, stronger, armour, and, armament, in, their, invasion, of, poland, during, september, 1939, german, forces, applied, a, narrow, cooperation, between, large, armoured, units, of, the, panzerwaffe, and, the, cavalry, and, active, infantry, divisions, to, break, the, polish, defensive, lines, and, pursue, the, defeated, enemy, forces, the, more, limited, and, dispersed, polish, armoured, units, were, quickly, destroyed, the, red, army, invading, the, east, of, poland, also, deployed, armoured, divisions, at, the, time, the, swift, collapse, of, the, polish, army, was, seen, as, the, result, of, an, armoured, blitzkrieg, however, later, it, has, been, argued, that, the, campaign, was, largely, an, instance, of, the, classical, nineteenth, century, german, concept, of, the, annihilation, battle, in, which, the, role, of, deep, strategic, armoured, penetrations, was, limited, in, the, wake, of, the, polish, campaign, during, the, phoney, war, french, british, and, german, tank, production, sharply, increased, with, both, western, allies, out, producing, germany, however, the, anglo, french, coalition, proved, unable, to, match, the, germans, in, the, number, of, armoured, divisions, as, it, was, impossible, to, quickly, raise, such, large, units, though, the, french, possessed, a, superior, number, of, tanks, often, better, armoured, and, armed, half, of, these, were, allotted, at, army, level, to, independent, bataillons, de, chars, de, combat, battle, tank, battalions, for, infantry, support, in, early, 1940, the, german, command, had, concluded, that, it, could, not, win, a, war, of, attrition, and, embarked, on, a, high, risk, strategy, they, approved, the, manstein, plan, envisaging, an, advance, through, the, ardennes, by, the, main, mass, of, german, infantry, divisions, spearheaded, by, seven, armoured, divisions, while, the, main, mobile, french, reserve, consisting, of, three, cavalry, armoured, divisions, divisions, l, g, res, m, caniques, or, mechanised, light, divisions, the, only, armoured, units, organised, on, the, lines, of, the, german, armoured, divisions, would, be, lured, into, the, low, countries, by, a, feint, attack, with, a, lesser, force, including, three, armoured, divisions, in, may, 1940, during, the, battle, of, france, the, german, feint, resulted, in, a, number, of, undecided, armour, engagements, among, them, the, battle, of, hannut, the, largest, tank, battle, fought, until, that, date, at, the, same, time, german, motorised, infantry, west, of, the, ardennes, forced, the, crossings, over, the, river, meuse, assisted, by, massive, carpet, bombing, of, the, crossing, points, in, the, original, plan, the, armoured, divisions, were, again, supposed, to, closely, cooperate, with, the, infantry, divisions, in, reality, armour, commanders, like, erwin, rommel, and, heinz, guderian, immediately, broke, out, of, the, bridgeheads, initiating, a, drive, towards, the, english, channel, which, was, reached, within, a, week, the, french, reserve, of, four, infantry, armoured, divisions, the, divisions, cuirass, es, lacked, sufficient, strategic, mobility, to, prevent, this, the, strategic, envelopment, surrounded, the, belgian, army, the, british, expeditionary, force, and, the, best, french, troops, it, led, to, the, evacuation, of, dunkirk, and, the, ultimate, fall, of, france, in, operation, fall, rot, the, spectacular, and, unexpected, success, not, only, caused, a, sudden, change, in, the, global, geostrategic, situation, gaining, germany, a, position, of, hegemony, on, the, european, continent, but, also, seemed, to, vindicate, the, theories, of, fuller, and, liddell, hart, confronted, with, the, undeniable, potential, of, armoured, manoeuvre, warfare, from, the, summer, of, 1940, onwards, the, armed, forces, of, all, surviving, major, powers, adapted, their, tactical, doctrine, unit, organisation, strategic, planning, and, tank, production, plans, according, to, frieser, this, was, even, true, for, germany, itself, that, only, now, officially, adopted, blitzkrieg, tactics, in, the, deserts, of, north, africa, the, british, developed, the, alternative, approach, of, combining, the, armoured, infantry, and, artillery, together, to, form, a, balanced, combined, arms, team, the, 10th, italian, army, of, maresciallo, marshal, rodolfo, graziani, being, ill, armed, and, inadequately, led, soon, gave, way, to, this, approach, by, the, commonwealth, troops, of, the, british, western, desert, force, the, arrival, of, the, german, afrika, korps, under, command, of, general, der, panzertruppe, erwin, rommel, highlighted, the, weaknesses, of, the, british, approach, the, small, number, of, infantry, and, artillery, in, each, armoured, division, was, sufficient, when, attacking, the, immobile, and, uncoordinated, italian, troops, but, against, the, highly, mobile, well, coordinated, german, units, the, undermanned, commonwealth, formations, were, proving, inadequate, between, 1941, and, 1942, the, allies, struggled, in, armoured, battles, in, the, north, african, desert, due, to, improper, tactics, in, particular, running, armoured, formations, into, opposing, anti, tank, positions, however, they, achieved, some, notable, successes, at, crusader, 1st, alamein, and, under, montgomery, finally, achieved, decisive, victories, in, particular, at, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, in, 2022, kendrick, kuo, assistant, professor, at, the, u, s, naval, war, college, wrote, that, due, to, factors, emanating, from, the, interwar, period, the, british, army, in, north, africa, initially, operated, their, armoured, units, with, little, infantry, or, artillery, support, meanwhile, the, germans, had, integrated, their, armour, with, mechanised, infantry, and, artillery, only, after, undoing, their, misplaced, emphasis, on, armour, were, the, british, able, to, restore, their, combat, effectiveness, much, of, the, red, army, development, in, tank, use, was, based, on, the, theoretical, work, carried, out, by, such, officers, as, tukhachevsky, and, triandafillov, in, the, mid, to, late, 1930s, this, was, as, part, of, the, two, directioned, concepts, one, being, infantry, centred, broad, front, and, the, other, being, a, shock, army, while, the, infantry, based, part, of, the, doctrine, demanded, powerful, tanks, heavy, tanks, armed, with, infantry, guns, and, machineguns, and, tankettes, light, often, amphibious, tanks, with, machineguns, the, shock, army, demanded, manoeuvre, tanks, fast, tanks, with, medium, guns, used, in, conjunction, with, motorised, forces, and, mechanised, cavalry, that, would, operate, in, depth, as, strategic, cavalry, combined, with, nascent, airborne, troops, these, ideas, culminated, in, the, pu, 36, or, the, 1936, field, service, regulations, at, the, start, of, the, second, world, war, much, of, the, red, army, including, its, armoured, forces, was, in, transition, and, recovering, from, the, 1937, repression, of, the, officer, corps, the, red, army, ignored, the, lessons, from, nomonhan, which, had, been, successfully, conducted, by, general, zhukov, and, relied, instead, on, lessons, from, politically, selected, officers, who, were, veterans, of, the, spanish, civil, war, the, result, was, a, poor, showing, during, the, winter, war, the, red, army, tank, fleet, was, extremely, large, consisting, of, some, 24, 000, vehicles, but, many, were, obsolete, or, unfit, for, service, due, to, difficulties, with, supplying, spare, parts, and, lack, of, qualified, support, staff, one, important, development, took, place, shortly, before, the, war, which, influenced, soviet, armoured, doctrine, and, tank, design, for, a, decade, the, creation, of, the, t, 34, developed, on, the, christie, suspension, chassis, and, using, sloped, armour, for, the, first, time, the, t, 34, proved, a, shock, to, the, german, forces, in, the, first, german, encounter, of, soviet, t, 34, and, kv, tanks, the, t, 34, had, an, excellent, combination, of, mobility, protection, and, firepower, using, wide, tracks, the, t, 34, was, also, able, to, negotiate, terrain, in, difficult, weather, conditions, something, that, persistently, dogged, the, german, designs, assessing, the, success, of, the, german, blitzkrieg, strategy, operational, methods, and, tactics, the, red, army, concluded, that, it, should, return, to, the, use, of, operational, methods, developed, before, the, war, so, the, tank, armies, were, eventually, created, to, complement, the, t, 34, heavy, tanks, self, propelled, artillery, and, tank, destroyers, were, also, designed, the, red, army, s, armoured, forces, were, used, in, concentrations, during, all, strategic, operations, of, the, red, army, in, world, war, ii, initiated, under, strict, secrecy, and, using, the, principle, of, surprise, in, germany, in, depth, research, through, theoretical, approaches, wargaming, and, exercises, developed, a, confidence, within, the, panzertruppe, itself, and, political, support, by, hitler, in, the, armoured, formation, as, the, key, battlefield, formation, although, this, view, was, before, 1940, not, shared, by, the, other, arms, of, service, a, key, part, of, this, doctrine, was, improved, communications, by, having, radios, in, all, tanks, although, this, ideal, suffered, from, technical, limits, as, most, tanks, had, receiver, sets, only, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, the, german, armoured, forces, benefited, from, a, much, more, profound, and, more, flexible, training, than, that, of, the, allies, on, the, tactical, and, operational, level, german, tanks, operated, while, directed, by, radio, communication, which, allowed, tank, commanders, to, take, greater, advantage, of, the, manoeuvrability, of, their, vehicles, even, after, the, conquest, of, poland, blitzkrieg, was, not, defined, on, the, strategic, level, guderian, and, von, manstein, devised, a, strategy, that, entailed, what, later, would, be, seen, as, the, essence, of, blitzkrieg, concentrated, panzer, divisions, performing, swift, deep, penetrations, this, strategy, was, not, initially, accepted, by, german, high, command, nevertheless, the, final, plans, for, the, invasion, of, france, in, 1940, hinged, on, the, element, of, a, schwerpunkt, at, sedan, and, was, assigned, to, such, forces, the, great, success, of, this, operation, led, to, blitzkrieg, being, integrated, with, strategic, planning, for, the, rest, of, the, war, german, tanks, could, carry, with, them, enough, fuel, and, supplies, to, go, almost, two, hundred, kilometers, and, enough, food, to, last, three, to, nine, days, this, relative, independence, from, supply, lines, proved, effective, and, allowed, them, to, advance, on, critical, targets, much, faster, and, without, hesitation, another, factor, was, the, ability, of, commanders, to, make, strategic, decisions, in, the, field, and, without, much, consultation, with, their, headquarters, the, orders, of, which, were, often, simply, ignored, a, prime, example, is, erwin, rommel, s, lead, from, the, front, approach, while, commanding, 7, panzer, division, which, allowed, him, a, flexible, response, to, the, battlefield, situation, an, instance, of, the, auftragstaktik, reliance, on, subordinates, to, make, their, own, decisions, the, effect, of, german, panzer, s, speed, mobility, and, communication, shocked, the, french, and, ultimately, were, the, deciding, factors, in, the, battle, it, overcame, their, inferiority, in, armour, and, armament, relative, to, the, main, french, materiel, such, as, the, char, b1, bis, the, superior, tactical, and, operational, praxis, combined, with, an, appropriate, strategic, implementation, enabled, the, germans, to, defeat, forces, superior, in, armour, both, quantitatively, and, qualitatively, in, the, battles, of, 1940, but, just, as, blitzkrieg, became, a, deliberate, military, doctrine, in, 1941, it, ultimately, failed, on, the, eastern, front, though, initially, attaining, spectacular, successes, before, the, war, heinz, guderian, had, in, his, achtung, panzer, propounded, a, thorough, mechanisation, of, the, german, forces, by, 1942, increased, afv, production, allowed, a, fuller, implementation, of, this, ideal, now, extensive, armoured, combined, arms, team, could, be, formed, distinct, from, a, purely, infantry, or, cavalry, formation, the, panzer, divisions, integrated, tanks, with, mechanised, infantry, riding, in, halftracks, to, be, protected, from, small, arms, fire, while, being, transported, and, self, propelled, artillery, howitzers, fitted, on, a, tank, chassis, this, allowed, the, panzer, division, to, become, an, independent, combat, force, in, principle, able, to, overcome, the, problems, of, attaining, a, breakthrough, against, entrenched, enemy, infantry, equipped, with, large, numbers, of, antitank, guns, with, the, potential, to, completely, halt, tank, assaults, inflicting, devastating, losses, to, armoured, units, without, infantry, support, however, much, of, the, afv, production, was, increasingly, diverted, away, from, the, panzertruppe, the, artillery, formed, its, own, sturmgesch, tz, units, and, infantry, divisions, were, given, their, own, panzerj, ger, companies, despite, lowering, their, formal, organic, strength, from, the, summer, of, 1943, onwards, the, armoured, divisions, were, structurally, short, of, tanks, though, the, u, s, had, established, the, tank, corps, in, world, war, i, using, french, renault, ft, light, tanks, and, british, mark, v, and, mark, v, heavy, tanks, and, some, officers, like, dwight, d, eisenhower, and, george, s, patton, jr, emerged, from, that, war, initially, as, avid, proponents, of, continuing, and, developing, an, american, armoured, force, the, rapid, reduction, of, the, forces, and, apathy, and, even, antipathy, towards, funding, and, maintaining, armed, forces, in, the, inter, war, years, led, to, relative, stagnation, of, armoured, doctrine, in, the, united, states, adna, r, chaffee, jr, virtually, alone, advocated, for, the, future, of, armoured, warfare, and, the, development, of, appropriate, training, equipment, and, doctrine, during, the, late, 1920s, through, the, 1930s, the, united, states, army, regarded, the, french, army, as, the, best, army, in, europe, and, consequently, the, u, s, army, frequently, copied, french, uniforms, the, american, civil, war, and, aeroplanes, only, when, france, was, rapidly, overrun, in, 1940, did, the, u, s, army, become, shocked, into, re, thinking, the, influences, by, the, perceived, actions, of, german, tanks, in, the, 1939, polish, campaign, its, armored, combat, arm, was, not, created, until, 1940, when, the, armored, force, was, born, on, 10, july, 1940, with, the, headquarters, armor, force, and, the, headquarters, i, armored, corps, established, at, fort, knox, on, july, 15, 1940, the, 7th, cavalry, brigade, mechanised, became, the, 1st, armored, division, the, 7th, provisional, tank, brigade, an, infantry, tank, unit, at, fort, benning, became, the, 2nd, armored, division, the, tank, battalion, was, established, at, fort, meade, md, and, a, small, armored, force, school, was, also, established, under, this, doctrine, u, s, tank, crews, of, both, armoured, divisions, and, ghq, tank, battalions, were, taught, to, fight, tanks, in, tank, on, tank, engagements, armoured, force, personnel, during, and, after, the, war, criticised, the, infantry, for, using, the, ghq, tank, battalions, assigned, to, infantry, divisions, strictly, as, infantry, support, the, u, s, combined, arms, team, included, air, support, artillery, engineers, and, a, tank, component, supplemented, by, tank, destroyers, formed, into, independent, tank, destroyer, battalions, the, latter, is, most, closely, identified, with, the, chief, of, army, ground, forces, lesley, j, mcnair, having, studied, the, early, german, successes, mcnair, came, under, the, belief, that, u, s, forces, would, be, faced, with, fast, moving, enemy, forces, who, would, seek, to, bypass, isolate, and, reduce, u, s, forces, in, a, replay, of, the, fall, of, france, to, stem, the, flood, of, marauding, panzers, fast, moving, powerfully, armed, tank, destroyer, battalions, were, created, to, be, held, back, and, used, in, the, counter, attack, it, was, also, calculated, that, u, s, interests, would, be, better, served, by, large, numbers, of, reliable, battle, worthiness, medium, tanks, rather, than, a, smaller, number, of, unreliable, heavy, tanks, it, was, decided, therefore, to, slow, the, production, of, the, u, s, heavy, tank, designs, such, as, the, m26, pershing, and, concentrate, resources, on, mass, producing, the, m4, sherman, and, tank, destroyers, such, as, the, m18, hellcat, to, be, able, get, into, position, to, counter, attack, the, tank, destroyers, had, to, be, fast, to, achieve, the, desired, mobility, and, agility, from, the, engines, available, the, armour, protection, was, sacrificed, a, measure, of, protection, coming, from, being, nimble, and, hopefully, from, being, able, to, knock, out, the, enemy, before, they, could, get, a, shot, in, although, they, usually, had, guns, of, either, 75, mm, or, 76, mm, calibre, the, m36, used, a, 90mm, calibre, gun, the, tank, destroyer, units, were, issued, with, the, ancestor, of, the, modern, armour, piercing, discarding, sabot, rounds, which, made, their, guns, much, more, powerful, than, a, simple, comparison, of, calibres, would, suggest, the, japanese, doctrine, was, mainly, french, in, concept, but, with, some, purely, japanese, elements, due, to, japan, s, naval, priorities, in, warship, construction, and, inter, service, feuds, the, marine, branch, of, the, ijn, favoured, all, around, protective, armour, ija, tanks, were, lightly, armoured, as, with, most, armour, during, the, 1930s, the, main, guns, were, small, in, calibre, 37, mm, for, their, type, 95, light, tanks, and, 47, mm, for, the, type, 97, medium, tank, but, this, was, sometimes, compensated, by, a, high, muzzle, velocity, the, ija, s, use, of, tanks, in, china, exemplifies, its, doctrine, light, tanks, were, used, for, scouting, or, acted, as, mobile, infantry, support, while, medium, tanks, supported, the, infantry, and, assaulted, deeper, objectives, but, did, not, fight, en, masse, in, 1939, the, japanese, army, engaged, soviet, armour, at, nomonhan, during, the, three, month, long, war, japanese, armour, had, shown, their, weakness, against, soviet, tanks, and, the, resulting, japanese, defeat, prompted, a, series, of, complaints, by, the, imperial, army, to, incorporate, improvements, in, future, japanese, armour, this, is, the, primary, reason, ija, tanks, were, not, as, successful, while, being, used, with, ija, tactics, the, tank, forces, of, the, u, s, army, consisted, of, the, m2a4, and, m3, stuart, light, tanks, up, until, 1941, although, these, vehicles, were, five, years, newer, than, the, 1935, built, type, 95, s, the, ija, and, u, s, light, tanks, were, comparable, to, each, other, and, seemingly, performed, well, for, their, respective, forces, during, jungle, combat, operations, during, their, phase, of, world, war, ii, as, with, all, armour, maintenance, was, a, continuous, challenge, especially, in, tropical, environments, when, ija, and, snlf, imperial, marines, tanks, did, clash, with, the, enemy, they, were, quickly, destroyed, by, concealed, anti, tank, guns, or, overwhelming, numbers, of, hostile, tanks, japan, was, a, naval, power, and, concentrated, its, production, on, warships, thus, placing, a, low, priority, on, armoured, vehicle, development, its, tanks, becoming, quickly, obsolete, during, the, later, years, of, the, war, a, number, of, designs, that, were, equal, to, heavier, foreign, types, were, on, the, drawing, board, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, but, would, only, be, built, in, small, numbers, towards, the, end, being, placed, in, reserve, to, be, deployed, for, the, defence, of, japan, itself, the, republic, of, china, s, national, revolutionary, army, s, 200th, division, was, the, country, s, only, mechanised, division, during, the, war, the, 200th, used, pre, war, tanks, acquired, from, italy, germany, and, the, soviet, union, the, conflict, between, arab, nations, in, the, east, mediterranean, region, and, israel, in, particular, would, serve, to, become, a, testing, ground, for, development, in, armoured, warfare, during, the, decades, of, the, cold, war, both, sides, in, the, arab, israeli, series, of, conflicts, made, heavy, use, of, tanks, and, other, armoured, vehicles, due, to, the, practicality, of, tanks, in, the, desert, environment, these, conflicts, largely, took, place, in, during, the, 1956, suez, war, and, six, day, war, 1967, israeli, armoured, units, typically, had, the, advantage, mainly, due, to, good, tactics, and, unit, cohesion, conversely, the, yom, kippur, war, 1973, illustrated, the, problems, that, can, arise, if, armoured, and, infantry, units, do, not, work, closely, together, israeli, tanks, operating, independently, in, large, numbers, were, decimated, by, egyptian, anti, tank, teams, well, distributed, amongst, regular, infantry, and, often, equipped, with, new, first, generation, portable, anti, tank, guided, missiles, this, is, an, extreme, example, but, exemplifies, what, has, been, fairly, thoroughly, documented, since, the, second, world, war, tanks, and, infantry, work, best, by, taking, advantage, of, each, other, s, strengths, and, combining, to, minimise, the, weaknesses, in, many, conflicts, it, was, usual, to, see, infantry, riding, on, the, back, of, tanks, ready, to, jump, off, and, provide, support, when, necessary, unfortunately, the, design, of, many, modern, tanks, makes, this, a, dangerous, practice, the, turboshaft, powered, m1, abrams, for, example, has, such, hot, exhaust, gas, that, nearby, infantry, have, to, be, careful, where, they, stand, tanks, can, also, be, very, vulnerable, to, well, aimed, artillery, well, coordinated, air, support, and, counter, battery, artillery, units, can, help, overcome, this, while, attempts, to, defeat, the, tank, were, made, before, and, during, the, second, world, war, through, the, use, of, conventional, high, velocity, anti, tank, artillery, this, proved, increasingly, difficult, in, the, post, war, period, due, to, increased, armour, protection, and, mobility, of, tanks, in, response, the, soviet, union, the, country, with, the, largest, armoured, fleet, in, the, world, strove, to, incorporate, some, anti, tank, capability, into, almost, every, infantry, weapon, by, the, 1960s, soviet, defense, scientists, were, designing, portable, anti, tank, guided, missiles, these, new, weapons, were, to, be, either, carried, by, infantry, or, fired, from, the, newly, developed, bmp, 1, infantry, fighting, vehicle, they, were, in, use, with, soviet, forces, before, the, end, of, the, decade, in, 1973, the, israeli, army, failed, to, anticipate, the, importance, of, these, new, weapon, systems, hundreds, of, at, 3, sagger, man, portable, anti, tank, guided, missiles, atgms, supplied, to, egypt, by, the, soviet, union, and, could, be, operated, by, infantry, without, having, extensive, training, inflicted, heavy, losses, on, the, israeli, armoured, formations, since, then, atgms, have, played, an, important, role, within, the, israeli, army, having, developed, advanced, domestic, made, versions, see, spike, gil, missile, which, have, been, widely, exported, throughout, the, world, in, the, recent, 2006, conflict, with, hezbollah, while, israeli, infantry, were, able, to, easily, defeat, opposing, atgm, teams, tanks, operating, on, their, own, suffered, several, hits, from, the, latest, advanced, russian, tandem, warhead, types, such, as, the, kornet, this, highlighted, that, tanks, operating, solely, in, the, era, of, atgms, are, extremely, vulnerable, responding, to, the, serious, tank, losses, suffered, against, hezbollah, rafael, advanced, defense, systems, in, cooperation, with, israel, aircraft, industries, developed, a, missile, defence, system, for, tanks, called, trophy, to, intercept, and, destroy, anti, tank, missiles, the, system, was, successfully, deployed, in, combat, on, march, 1, 2011, when, it, intercepted, an, anti, tank, missile, during, an, engagement, on, the, gaza, border, during, the, cold, war, nato, assumed, armoured, warfare, to, be, a, dominant, aspect, of, conventional, ground, warfare, in, europe, although, the, use, of, light, tanks, was, largely, discontinued, and, heavy, tanks, were, also, mostly, abandoned, the, medium, tank, design, evolved, into, heavier, models, due, to, increase, in, armour, and, larger, sized, main, weapon, resulting, in, the, main, battle, tank, mbt, which, came, into, existence, combining, most, of, the, different, types, of, tanks, during, world, war, ii, for, the, most, part, the, nato, armoured, doctrine, remained, defensive, and, dominated, by, use, of, nuclear, weapons, as, deterrence, although, most, nato, nations, began, the, cold, war, period, with, a, large, number, of, u, s, designed, tanks, in, their, fleets, there, was, a, considerable, degree, of, disagreement, on, the, design, of, future, mbts, among, the, nato, major, nations, both, the, u, s, and, germany, experimented, with, but, abandoned, the, missile, armed, mbt, 70, the, m26, pershing, basic, design, of, the, united, states, would, evolve, until, the, m60, main, battle, tank, was, replaced, with, the, gas, turbine, powered, m1, abrams, in, the, 1980s, the, british, army, also, retained, a, world, war, ii, tank, design, the, centurion, which, proved, to, be, highly, successful, and, was, not, fully, replaced, until, the, 1970s, the, west, german, bundeswehr, decided, to, develop, their, own, tank, in, the, 1960s, and, in, the, 1970s, produced, the, leopard, i, which, was, a, somewhat, lighter, design, conforming, to, german, doctrine, that, emphasised, speed, over, protection, from, the, same, initial, collaborative, project, as, the, leopard, i, the, french, series, of, amx, tanks, also, emphasised, manoeuvre, over, protection, by, the, 21st, century, most, advanced, western, main, battle, tanks, were, built, around, powerful, engines, large, 120, mm, guns, and, composite, armour, the, warsaw, pact, armoured, doctrine, was, substantially, influenced, by, the, developments, in, the, soviet, army, which, sought, to, adopt, its, existing, doctrine, evolved, during, world, war, ii, to, the, nuclear, battlefield, in, the, early, 1960s, this, led, to, a, number, of, important, developments, in, the, armoured, forces, and, their, supporting, arms, one, important, development, was, the, transition, of, the, second, world, war, use, of, cavalry, mechanised, group, cmg, into, the, cold, war, operational, manoeuvre, group, omg, that, was, designed, to, exploit, breakthroughs, to, penetrate, nato, s, defences, in, depth, this, was, a, culmination, of, the, deep, battle, theory, dating, to, the, 1930s, in, 1964, a, significant, breakthrough, in, tank, design, was, achieved, in, the, soviet, union, when, the, t, 64, was, produced, which, for, the, first, time, used, an, automatic, loader, reducing, the, crew, of, the, tank, to, three, crewmen, subsequently, this, model, and, the, later, t, 72, and, t, 80, tanks, introduced, further, innovations, that, influenced, armoured, warfare, by, introducing, guided, missiles, into, the, tank, ammunition, mix, allowing, atgw, fire, from, standard, tank, guns, the, soviet, union, was, also, one, of, the, countries, that, used, two, main, battle, tanks, the, high, quality, t, 80s, and, lower, quality, t, 72s, modern, soviet, tanks, like, the, ones, mentioned, are, typically, armed, with, 125, mm, 5, in, smooth, bore, guns, advancements, in, soviet, tanks, include, improved, fire, control, systems, strong, armour, protected, by, era, and, defensive, countermeasures, such, as, shtora, 1, and, arena, the, most, advanced, soviet, tank, up, until, the, end, of, the, cold, war, was, the, t, 80u, which, shared, similar, characteristics, with, the, m1a1, turbine, engine, advanced, fire, control, systems, strong, armour, and, firepower, infantry, fighting, vehicles, were, first, developed, in, the, 1960s, with, the, soviet, union, s, bmp, 1, for, the, first, time, allowing, supporting, infantry, to, accompany, tanks, on, a, battlefield, when, nuclear, weapon, use, was, expected, the, t, 64s, and, bmp, 1s, were, also, joined, by, the, self, propelled, guns, and, more, importantly, mi, 24, rotary, wing, aircraft, capable, of, firing, anti, tank, missiles, entering, production, in, 1970, which, were, built, and, theorised, as, flying, tanks, the, soviet, tank, troops, as, they, were, known, in, the, ussr, included, armoured, units, armoured, training, regiments, and, other, formations, and, units, m113, armoured, personnel, carriers, proved, effective, in, the, terrain, of, vietnam, against, enemy, forces, which, until, 1968, rarely, deployed, their, armour, though, they, were, soon, countered, with, mines, and, rpgs, m, 113, s, continued, service, during, the, war, primarily, evolving, into, infantry, fighting, vehicles, known, as, the, acav, armoured, cavalry, assault, vehicle, and, functioning, as, a, light, tank, more, heavily, armed, infantry, fighting, vehicles, such, as, the, m2, m3, bradley, fighting, vehicle, would, be, based, on, experience, with, the, m113, gun, trucks, were, also, introduced, as, m35, trucks, fitted, with, armour, and, guns, to, protect, convoys, in, 1968, communist, forces, primarily, deployed, the, soviet, built, pt, 76, light, tank, by, 1971, the, larger, t, 54, medium, tanks, were, fielded, proving, themselves, susceptible, to, the, m, 72, law, rocket, arvn, m41, walker, bulldog, light, tanks, as, well, as, the, larger, m48a3, pattons, in, january, 1969, u, s, armoured, cavalry, units, began, exchanging, their, m48a3, patton, tanks, for, the, m551, sheridan, armoured, airborne, reconnaissance, assault, vehicles, by, 1970, over, 200, sheridan, tanks, were, operating, in, vietnam, tanks, rarely, work, alone, the, usual, minimum, unit, size, is, a, platoon, a, platoon, is, the, smallest, u, s, army, marine, unit, led, by, an, officer, and, a, component, of, a, company, or, troop, of, three, to, five, tanks, the, tanks, of, the, platoon, work, together, providing, mutual, support, two, might, advance, while, covered, by, the, others, then, stop, and, provide, cover, for, the, remainder, to, move, ahead, normally, multiple, platoons, coordinate, with, mechanised, infantry, and, use, their, mobility, and, firepower, to, penetrate, weak, points, in, enemy, lines, this, is, where, the, powerful, engines, tracks, and, turrets, come, into, play, the, ability, to, rotate, the, turret, by, a, full, 360, allows, coordinated, movement, within, and, between, platoons, while, defending, against, attacks, from, multiple, directions, and, engaging, troops, and, vehicles, without, stopping, or, slowing, down, when, on, the, defensive, they, wait, in, prepared, positions, or, use, any, natural, terrain, elements, such, as, small, hills, for, cover, a, tank, sitting, just, behind, a, hill, crest, hull, down, exposes, only, the, top, of, its, turret, with, the, gun, and, sensors, to, the, enemy, leaving, the, smallest, possible, target, while, allowing, it, to, engage, the, enemy, on, the, other, side, of, the, hill, tanks, are, usually, able, to, depress, the, main, gun, below, the, horizontal, since, modern, kinetic, energy, ke, rounds, have, nearly, flat, trajectories, without, this, they, would, be, unable, to, exploit, such, positions, however, upon, cresting, a, hill, the, tank, may, expose, its, thinly, armoured, underside, to, enemy, weapons, the, disposition, of, armour, around, a, tank, is, not, uniform, the, front, is, typically, better, armoured, than, the, sides, or, rear, accordingly, normal, practice, is, to, keep, the, front, towards, the, enemy, at, all, times, the, tank, retreats, by, reversing, instead, of, turning, around, driving, backwards, away, from, an, enemy, is, even, safer, than, driving, forwards, towards, them, since, driving, forwards, over, a, bump, can, throw, the, front, of, the, tank, up, in, the, air, exposing, the, thin, armour, of, the, underside, and, taking, the, gun, off, the, target, due, to, its, limited, angle, of, depression, the, tracks, wheels, and, suspension, of, a, tank, are, outside, the, armoured, hull, and, are, some, of, the, most, vulnerable, spots, the, easiest, way, to, disable, a, tank, other, than, a, direct, hit, in, a, vulnerable, area, with, a, full, power, anti, tank, weapon, is, to, target, the, tracks, for, a, mobility, kill, m, kill, or, target, all, external, visual, aids, with, rubbery, cohesive, substances, such, as, melted, rubber, or, blackened, high, viscosity, epoxy, resins, once, a, tank, is, disabled, it, is, easier, to, destroy, this, is, why, side, skirts, are, an, important, feature, they, can, deflect, heavy, machine, gun, bullets, and, trigger, the, detonation, of, high, explosive, anti, tank, heat, rounds, before, they, strike, the, running, gear, other, vulnerable, parts, of, a, typical, tank, include, the, engine, deck, with, air, intakes, radiators, etc, and, the, turret, ring, where, the, turret, joins, the, hull, when, used, defensively, tanks, are, often, sunk, into, trenches, or, placed, behind, earth, berms, for, increased, protection, the, tanks, can, fire, off, a, few, shots, from, their, defensive, position, then, retreat, reversing, to, another, prepared, position, further, back, and, drive, behind, the, berms, or, into, the, trenches, there, these, positions, can, be, constructed, by, the, tank, crews, but, preparations, are, better, and, quicker, if, carried, out, by, combat, engineers, with, bulldozers, overhead, protection, even, if, it, is, fairly, thin, can, also, be, very, useful, since, it, can, help, pre, detonate, artillery, shells, and, avoid, direct, hits, from, above, which, can, be, deadly, to, tanks, by, striking, them, at, their, thinnest, armour, in, short, tank, crews, find, as, many, ways, as, possible, to, augment, the, armour, on, their, vehicles, tanks, usually, go, into, battle, with, a, round, in, the, gun, ready, to, fire, to, minimise, reaction, time, when, encountering, an, enemy, the, us, doctrine, calls, for, this, round, to, be, a, kinetic, energy, ke, round, as, the, reaction, time, is, most, important, when, meeting, enemy, tanks, to, get, the, first, shot, and, possibly, the, first, kill, if, troops, or, light, vehicles, are, encountered, the, usual, response, is, to, fire, this, round, at, them, despite, it, not, being, ideal, it, is, difficult, and, time, consuming, to, remove, a, round, which, is, already, in, the, breech, in, this, case, after, the, ke, round, is, fired, a, heat, round, would, normally, be, loaded, next, to, continue, the, engagement, tanks, can, be, decisive, in, city, fighting, with, the, ability, to, demolish, walls, and, fire, medium, and, heavy, machine, guns, in, several, directions, simultaneously, however, tanks, are, especially, vulnerable, in, urban, combat, it, is, much, easier, for, enemy, infantry, to, sneak, up, behind, a, tank, or, fire, at, its, sides, where, it, is, most, vulnerable, in, addition, firing, down, from, multi, story, buildings, allows, shots, at, the, thin, upper, turret, armour, and, even, basic, weapons, like, molotov, cocktails, if, aimed, at, the, engine, air, intakes, can, disable, a, tank, because, of, these, limits, tanks, are, difficult, to, use, in, city, conflicts, where, civilians, or, friendly, forces, might, be, nearby, since, their, firepower, can, t, be, used, effectively, some, analysts, argue, that, recent, conflicts, like, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, highlight, the, growing, vulnerability, of, tanks, estimates, from, early, 2024, indicate, that, russia, has, lost, around, 3, 000, tanks, in, the, first, two, years, of, the, conflict, with, the, actual, number, likely, being, higher, in, contrast, during, the, israel, hamas, war, israeli, tanks, equipped, with, active, protection, systems, aps, showed, improved, survivability, against, anti, tank, missiles, additionally, using, tanks, in, pairs, with, overlapping, aps, provided, extra, defense, and, enhanced, their, overall, effectiveness, tanks, and, other, armoured, vehicles, are, vulnerable, to, attack, from, the, air, for, several, reasons, one, is, that, they, are, easily, detectable, the, metal, they, are, made, of, shows, up, well, on, radar, and, is, especially, obvious, if, they, are, moving, in, formation, a, moving, tank, also, produces, a, lot, of, heat, noise, and, dust, the, heat, makes, seeing, them, on, a, forward, looking, infra, red, system, easy, and, the, dust, is, a, good, visual, cue, during, the, day, the, other, major, reason, is, that, most, armoured, vehicles, have, thinner, armour, on, the, roof, of, the, turret, and, on, the, engine, deck, so, an, anti, tank, guided, missile, or, bomb, from, an, attack, helicopter, unmanned, combat, aerial, vehicle, ground, attack, jet, or, small, drone, hitting, them, from, the, top, can, be, deadly, even, if, it, has, a, small, warhead, even, a, small, automatic, cannon, is, powerful, enough, to, penetrate, the, rear, and, top, sections, of, the, engine, compartment, of, a, tank, loitering, munition, suicide, drone, is, also, used, to, attack, tanks, in, modern, warfare, certain, aircraft, have, been, developed, to, attack, armoured, vehicles, most, notable, is, the, purpose, built, fairchild, republic, a, 10, thunderbolt, ii, also, known, as, the, warthog, although, able, to, carry, a, number, of, different, missiles, and, bombs, including, anti, tank, ordnance, such, as, the, agm, 65, maverick, the, a, 10, s, main, weapon, is, a, 30, mm, gau, 8, a, avenger, gatling, gun, which, is, capable, of, firing, 3, 900, depleted, uranium, armour, piercing, rounds, per, minute, the, russian, equivalent, is, the, su, 25, similarly, a, number, of, helicopter, gunships, have, been, designed, mainly, to, engage, enemy, armoured, vehicles, the, ah, 1z, viper, ah, 64, apache, hal, light, combat, helicopter, denel, rooivalk, eurocopter, tiger, ka, 50, black, shark, mi, 28, havoc, a129, mangusta, and, westland, lynx, are, examples, helicopters, are, very, effective, against, armoured, vehicles, for, many, reasons, the, ah, 64d, longbow, apache, for, example, is, equipped, with, an, improved, sensor, suite, and, weapon, systems, and, the, an, apg, 78, longbow, fire, control, radar, dome, installed, over, the, main, rotor, airborne, threats, can, be, countered, in, several, ways, one, is, air, supremacy, this, is, what, the, united, states, relies, on, most, which, is, demonstrated, by, their, distinct, lack, of, effective, short, range, mobile, air, defence, vehicles, to, accompany, armoured, units, most, other, countries, accompany, their, armoured, forces, with, highly, mobile, self, propelled, anti, aircraft, guns, such, as, the, german, gepard, or, the, soviet, 9k22, tunguska, short, and, medium, range, surface, to, air, missile, systems, such, as, the, sa, 6, sa, 8, and, sa, 11, or, combine, both, on, the, same, vehicle, the, tunguska, for, example, can, also, host, sa, 19, sam, missiles, the, usage, of, anti, aircraft, rounds, fired, from, the, main, gun, of, a, tank, has, been, increasing, over, the, years, an, example, is, the, he, frag, round, from, the, t, 90, which, can, be, detonated, at, a, set, distance, as, determined, by, its, laser, range, finder, armoured, warfare, is, mechanically, and, logistically, intensive, and, requires, extensive, support, mechanisms, armoured, fighting, vehicles, require, armoured, vehicles, capable, of, working, in, the, same, terrain, to, support, them, these, are, operated, by, the, appropriate, branches, of, the, army, e, g, recovery, and, maintenance, vehicles, by, the, reme, and, combat, engineering, vehicles, by, the, re, in, the, british, army, these, include, for, transporting, tracked, afvs, over, highways, heavy, transporters, are, used, since, afvs, are, prone, to, malfunction, and, their, tracks, also, ruin, the, highways, while, tanks, are, integral, to, armoured, warfare, when, power, projection, is, required, the, inability, to, perform, rapid, deployment, has, always, been, a, limit, of, heavy, main, battle, tanks, it, takes, a, few, weeks, to, transfer, tanks, and, their, supporting, equipment, by, air, or, sea, some, tanks, and, armoured, vehicles, can, be, dropped, by, parachute, or, carried, by, cargo, airplanes, or, helicopters, the, largest, transports, can, only, carry, one, or, two, main, battle, tanks, smaller, transports, can, only, carry, or, air, drop, light, tanks, and, apcs, such, as, the, m113, the, desire, to, create, air, portable, armoured, vehicles, that, can, still, take, on, conventional, mbts, has, usually, resulted, in, atgm, armed, light, vehicles, or, in, self, propelled, gun, style, vehicles, the, lack, of, armour, protection, is, offset, by, the, provision, of, a, first, look, first, hit, first, kill, capability, through, the, mating, of, a, powerful, gun, to, superior, targeting, electronics, a, concept, similar, to, that, of, the, us, tank, destroyers, of, world, war, ii, vehicles, which, have, put, such, considerations, into, practice, include, the, stingray, light, tank, amx, 10, rc, and, b1, centauro, most, such, us, projects, to, create, such, vehicles, have, been, abortive, e, g, the, m8, armored, gun, system, the, most, common, was, the, flawed, m551, sheridan, light, tank, this, was, an, air, portable, tank, capable, of, destroying, heavier, tanks, using, the, revolutionary, for, the, time, 152, mm, clgp, launcher, the, combat, effectiveness, of, this, tank, was, limited, by, the, unreliable, mgm, 51, missile, the, latest, iteration, of, the, mobile, anti, tank, gun, platform, in, american, service, is, the, m1134, anti, tank, guided, missile, vehicle, a, stryker, variant, equipped, with, tow, missiles, most, modern, militaries, operate, comparable, vehicles, though, limited, conflicts, such, as, the, insurgency, in, iraq, rarely, involve, direct, combat, between, armoured, vehicles, the, need, to, defend, against, insurgent, attacks, and, ieds, has, resulted, in, the, application, of, armour, to, light, vehicles, and, the, continued, use, of, armoured, transports, fighting, vehicles, and, tanks
