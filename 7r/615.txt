genius, sesame, street, creator, joan, ganz, cooney, according, to, writer, michael, davis, by, the, mid, 1970s, the, show, had, become, an, american, institution, the, cast, and, crew, expanded, during, this, time, with, emphasis, on, the, hiring, of, women, crew, members, and, the, addition, of, minorities, to, the, cast, the, show, s, success, continued, into, the, 1980s, in, 1981, when, the, federal, government, withdrew, its, funding, ctw, turned, to, and, expanded, other, revenue, sources, including, its, magazine, division, book, royalties, product, licensing, and, foreign, broadcast, income, its, curriculum, has, expanded, to, include, more, affective, topics, such, as, relationships, ethics, and, emotions, many, of, its, storylines, have, been, inspired, by, the, experiences, of, its, writing, staff, cast, and, crew, most, notably, the, 1982, death, of, will, lee, who, played, mr, hooper, and, the, marriage, of, luis, and, maria, in, 1988, by, the, end, of, the, 1990s, the, show, faced, societal, and, economic, challenges, including, changes, in, young, children, s, viewing, habits, competition, from, other, shows, the, development, of, cable, television, and, a, drop, in, ratings, as, the, 21st, century, began, the, show, made, major, changes, starting, in, 2002, its, format, became, more, narrative, focused, and, included, ongoing, storylines, after, its, 30th, anniversary, in, 1999, due, to, the, popularity, of, the, muppet, elmo, the, show, also, incorporated, a, popular, segment, known, as, elmo, s, world, in, 2009, the, show, won, the, outstanding, achievement, emmy, for, its, 40, years, on, the, air, in, late, 2015, in, response, to, sweeping, changes, in, the, media, business, and, as, part, of, a, five, year, programming, and, development, deal, premium, television, service, hbo, began, airing, first, run, episodes, of, sesame, street, the, episodes, became, available, on, pbs, stations, and, websites, nine, months, after, they, aired, on, hbo, the, deal, allowed, sesame, workshop, to, produce, more, episodes, increasing, from, 18, to, 35, per, season, and, to, create, a, spinoff, series, with, the, sesame, street, muppets, and, a, new, educational, series, at, its, 50th, anniversary, in, 2019, sesame, street, had, produced, over, 4, 500, episodes, two, feature, length, movies, follow, that, bird, in, 1985, and, the, adventures, of, elmo, in, grouchland, in, 1999, 35, tv, specials, 200, home, videos, and, 180, albums, its, youtube, channel, has, almost, five, million, subscribers, it, was, announced, in, october, 2019, that, first, run, episodes, will, move, to, hbo, max, beginning, with, the, show, s, 51st, season, in, 2020, from, its, first, episode, sesame, street, s, format, has, utilized, a, strong, visual, style, fast, moving, action, humor, and, music, as, well, as, animation, and, live, action, short, films, when, it, premiered, most, researchers, believed, that, young, children, did, not, have, long, attention, spans, and, the, show, s, producers, were, concerned, that, an, hour, long, show, would, not, hold, their, attention, at, first, its, street, scenes, the, action, recorded, on, its, set, consisted, of, character, driven, interactions, rather, than, ongoing, stories, they, were, written, as, individual, curriculum, based, segments, interrupted, by, inserts, of, puppet, sketches, short, films, and, animations, this, structure, allowed, producers, to, use, a, mixture, of, styles, and, characters, and, to, vary, its, pace, presumably, keeping, it, interesting, to, young, viewers, however, by, season, 20, research, showed, that, children, were, able, to, follow, a, story, and, the, street, scenes, while, still, interspersed, with, other, segments, became, evolving, storylines, we, basically, deconstructed, the, show, it, s, not, a, magazine, format, anymore, it, s, more, like, the, sesame, hour, children, will, be, able, to, navigate, through, it, easier, executive, producer, arlene, sherman, speaking, of, the, show, s, restructuring, in, 2002, on, recommendations, by, child, psychologists, the, producers, initially, decided, that, the, show, s, human, actors, and, muppets, would, not, interact, because, they, were, concerned, it, would, confuse, young, children, when, ctw, tested, the, new, show, they, found, that, children, paid, attention, during, the, muppet, segments, and, that, their, interest, was, lost, during, the, street, segments, they, requested, that, henson, and, his, team, create, muppets, such, as, big, bird, and, oscar, the, grouch, to, interact, with, the, human, actors, and, the, street, segments, were, re, shot, sesame, street, s, format, remained, intact, until, the, 2000s, when, the, changing, audience, required, that, producers, move, to, a, more, narrative, format, in, 1998, the, popular, elmo, s, world, a, 15, minute, long, segment, hosted, by, the, muppet, elmo, was, created, starting, in, 2014, during, the, show, s, 45th, season, the, producers, introduced, a, half, hour, version, of, the, program, the, new, version, which, originally, complemented, the, full, hour, series, was, broadcast, weekday, afternoons, and, streamed, on, the, internet, in, 2017, in, response, to, the, changing, viewing, habits, of, toddlers, the, show, s, producers, decreased, the, show, s, length, from, one, hour, to, 30, minutes, across, all, its, broadcast, platforms, the, new, version, focused, on, fewer, characters, reduced, pop, culture, references, once, included, as, winks, for, their, parents, and, focused, on, a, single, backbone, topic, author, malcolm, gladwell, said, that, sesame, street, was, built, around, a, single, breakthrough, insight, that, if, you, can, hold, the, attention, of, children, you, can, educate, them, gerald, s, lesser, the, ctw, s, first, advisory, board, chair, went, even, further, saying, that, the, effective, use, of, television, as, an, educational, tool, needed, to, capture, focus, and, sustain, children, s, attention, sesame, street, was, the, first, children, s, show, to, structure, each, episode, and, the, segments, within, them, to, capture, children, s, attention, and, to, make, as, gladwell, put, it, small, but, critical, adjustments, to, keep, it, according, to, ctw, researchers, rosemarie, truglio, and, shalom, fisch, it, was, one, of, the, few, children, s, shows, to, utilize, a, detailed, and, comprehensive, educational, curriculum, garnered, from, formative, and, summative, research, sesame, street, s, creators, and, researchers, formulated, both, cognitive, and, affective, goals, for, the, show, they, initially, focused, on, cognitive, goals, while, addressing, affective, goals, indirectly, believing, it, would, increase, children, s, self, esteem, and, feelings, of, competency, one, of, their, primary, goals, was, preparing, young, children, for, school, especially, children, from, low, income, families, using, modeling, repetition, and, humor, they, adjusted, its, content, to, increase, viewers, attention, and, the, show, s, appeal, and, encouraged, older, children, and, parents, to, co, view, it, by, including, more, sophisticated, humor, cultural, references, and, celebrity, guests, by, 2019, 80, of, parents, watched, sesame, street, with, their, children, and, 650, celebrities, had, appeared, on, the, show, during, sesame, street, s, first, season, some, critics, felt, that, it, should, address, more, overtly, such, affective, goals, as, social, competence, tolerance, of, diversity, and, nonaggressive, ways, of, resolving, conflict, the, show, s, creators, and, producers, responded, by, featuring, these, themes, in, interpersonal, disputes, between, its, street, characters, during, the, 1980s, the, show, incorporated, real, life, experiences, of, its, cast, and, crew, including, the, death, of, will, lee, mr, hooper, and, the, pregnancy, of, sonia, manzano, maria, in, later, seasons, it, addressed, real, life, disasters, such, as, the, september, 11, terrorist, attacks, and, hurricane, katrina, in, its, first, season, the, show, addressed, its, outreach, goals, by, focusing, on, the, promotion, of, educational, materials, used, in, preschool, settings, and, in, subsequent, seasons, by, focusing, on, their, development, innovative, programs, were, developed, because, their, target, audience, children, and, their, families, in, low, income, inner, city, homes, did, not, traditionally, watch, educational, programs, on, television, and, because, traditional, methods, of, promotion, and, advertising, were, not, effective, with, these, groups, starting, in, 2006, the, workshop, expanded, its, outreach, by, creating, a, series, of, pbs, specials, and, dvds, focusing, on, how, military, deployment, affects, the, families, of, servicepeople, its, outreach, efforts, also, focused, on, families, of, prisoners, health, and, wellness, and, safety, in, 2013, sw, started, sesame, street, in, communities, to, help, families, dealing, with, difficult, issues, as, a, result, of, cooney, s, initial, proposal, in, 1968, the, carnegie, institute, awarded, her, a, 1, million, grant, to, create, a, new, children, s, television, program, and, establish, the, ctw, renamed, in, june, 2000, to, sesame, workshop, sw, cooney, and, morrisett, procured, additional, multimillion, dollar, grants, from, the, u, s, federal, government, the, arthur, vining, davis, foundations, cpb, and, the, ford, foundation, davis, reported, that, cooney, and, morrisett, decided, that, if, they, did, not, procure, full, funding, from, the, beginning, they, would, drop, the, idea, of, producing, the, show, as, lesser, reported, funds, gained, from, a, combination, of, government, agencies, and, private, foundations, protected, them, from, the, economic, pressures, experienced, by, commercial, broadcast, television, networks, but, created, challenges, in, procuring, future, funding, after, sesame, street, s, initial, success, its, producers, began, to, think, about, its, survival, beyond, its, development, and, first, season, and, decided, to, explore, other, funding, sources, from, the, first, season, they, understood, that, the, source, of, their, funding, which, they, considered, seed, money, would, need, to, be, replaced, the, 1970s, were, marked, by, conflicts, between, the, ctw, and, the, federal, government, in, 1978, the, u, s, department, of, education, refused, to, deliver, a, 2, million, check, equivalent, to, 9, 34, million, in, 2023, until, the, last, day, of, ctw, s, fiscal, year, as, a, result, the, ctw, decided, to, depend, upon, licensing, arrangements, with, toy, companies, and, other, manufacturers, publishing, and, international, sales, for, their, funding, in, 1998, the, ctw, accepted, corporate, sponsorship, to, raise, funds, for, sesame, street, and, other, projects, for, the, first, time, they, allowed, short, advertisements, by, indoor, playground, manufacturer, discovery, zone, their, first, corporate, sponsor, to, air, before, and, after, each, episode, consumer, advocate, ralph, nader, who, had, previously, appeared, on, sesame, street, called, for, a, boycott, of, the, show, saying, that, the, ctw, was, exploiting, impressionable, children, in, 2015, in, response, to, funding, challenges, it, was, announced, that, premium, television, service, hbo, would, air, first, run, episodes, of, sesame, street, steve, youngwood, sw, s, chief, operating, officer, called, the, move, one, of, the, toughest, decisions, we, ever, made, according, to, the, new, york, times, the, move, drew, an, immediate, backlash, critics, claimed, that, it, favored, privileged, children, over, less, advantaged, children, and, their, families, the, original, focus, of, the, show, they, also, criticized, choosing, to, air, first, run, episodes, on, hbo, a, network, with, adult, dramas, and, comedies, producer, joan, ganz, cooney, has, stated, without, research, there, would, be, no, sesame, street, in, 1967, when, she, and, her, team, began, planning, the, show, s, development, combining, research, with, television, production, was, as, she, put, it, positively, heretical, its, producers, soon, began, developing, what, came, to, be, called, the, ctw, model, a, system, of, planning, production, and, evaluation, that, did, not, fully, emerge, until, the, end, of, the, show, s, first, season, according, to, morrow, the, model, consisted, of, four, parts, the, interaction, of, receptive, television, producers, and, child, science, experts, the, creation, of, a, specific, and, age, appropriate, curriculum, research, to, shape, the, program, directly, and, independent, measurement, of, viewers, learning, cooney, credited, the, show, s, high, standard, in, research, procedures, to, harvard, professors, gerald, s, lesser, whom, ctw, hired, to, design, its, educational, objectives, and, edward, l, palmer, who, conducted, the, show, s, formative, research, and, bridged, the, gap, between, producers, and, researchers, ctw, conducted, research, in, two, ways, in, house, formative, research, that, informed, and, improved, production, and, independent, summative, evaluations, conducted, by, the, educational, testing, service, ets, during, the, first, two, seasons, which, measured, its, educational, effectiveness, cooney, said, from, the, beginning, we, the, planners, of, the, project, designed, the, show, as, an, experimental, research, project, with, educational, advisers, researchers, and, television, producers, collaborating, as, equal, partners, she, characterized, the, collaboration, as, an, arranged, marriage, sesame, street, has, used, many, writers, in, its, long, history, as, peter, hellman, wrote, in, his, 1987, article, in, new, york, magazine, the, show, of, course, depends, upon, its, writers, and, it, isn, t, easy, to, find, adults, who, could, identify, the, interest, level, of, a, pre, schooler, fifteen, writers, a, year, worked, on, the, show, s, scripts, but, very, few, lasted, longer, than, one, season, norman, stiles, head, writer, in, 1987, reported, that, most, writers, would, burn, out, after, writing, about, a, dozen, scripts, according, to, gikow, sesame, street, went, against, the, convention, of, hiring, teachers, to, write, for, the, show, as, most, educational, television, programs, did, at, the, time, instead, cooney, and, the, producers, felt, that, it, would, be, easier, to, teach, writers, how, to, interpret, curriculum, than, to, teach, educators, how, to, write, comedy, as, stone, stated, writing, for, children, is, not, so, easy, long, time, writer, tony, geiss, agreed, stating, in, 2009, it, s, not, an, easy, show, to, write, you, have, to, know, the, characters, and, the, format, and, how, to, teach, and, be, funny, at, the, same, time, which, is, a, big, ambidextrous, stunt, the, show, s, research, team, developed, an, annotated, document, or, writer, s, notebook, which, served, as, a, bridge, between, the, show, s, curriculum, goals, and, script, development, the, notebook, was, a, compilation, of, programming, ideas, designed, to, teach, specific, curriculum, points, provided, extended, definitions, of, curriculum, goals, and, assisted, the, writers, and, producers, in, translating, the, goals, into, televised, material, suggestions, in, the, notebook, were, free, of, references, to, specific, characters, and, contexts, on, the, show, so, that, they, could, be, implemented, as, openly, and, flexibly, as, possible, the, research, team, in, a, series, of, meetings, with, the, writers, also, developed, a, curriculum, sheet, that, described, the, show, s, goals, and, priorities, for, each, season, after, receiving, the, curriculum, focus, and, goals, for, the, season, the, writers, met, to, discuss, ideas, and, story, arcs, for, the, characters, and, an, assignment, sheet, was, created, that, suggested, how, much, time, was, allotted, for, each, goal, and, topic, when, a, script, was, completed, the, show, s, research, team, analyzed, it, to, ensure, that, the, goals, were, met, then, each, production, department, met, to, determine, what, each, episode, needed, in, terms, of, costumes, lights, and, sets, the, writers, were, present, during, the, show, s, taping, which, for, the, first, twenty, four, years, of, the, show, took, place, in, manhattan, and, after, 1992, at, the, kaufman, astoria, studios, in, queens, to, make, last, minute, revisions, when, necessary, early, in, their, history, sesame, street, and, the, ctw, began, to, look, for, alternative, funding, sources, and, turned, to, creating, products, and, writing, licensing, agreements, they, became, as, cooney, put, it, a, multiple, media, institution, in, 1970, the, ctw, created, a, non, broadcast, division, responsible, for, creating,

those, characters, and, was, reluctant, to, market, them, at, first, he, agreed, when, the, ctw, promised, that, the, profits, from, toys, books, computer, games, and, other, products, were, to, be, used, exclusively, to, fund, the, ctw, and, its, outreach, efforts, even, though, cooney, and, the, ctw, had, very, little, experience, with, marketing, they, demanded, complete, control, over, all, products, and, product, decisions, any, product, line, associated, with, the, show, had, to, be, educational, and, inexpensive, and, could, not, be, advertised, during, the, show, s, airings, as,

1968, joan, ganz, cooney, was, named, its, first, executive, director, she, was, one, of, the, first, female, executives, in, american, television, her, appointment, was, called, one, of, the, most, important, television, developments, of, the, decade, she, assembled, a, team, of, producers, all, of, whom, had, previously, worked, on, captain, kangaroo, jon, stone, was, responsible, for, writing, casting, and, format, dave, connell, took, over, animation, and, sam, gibbon, served, as, the, show, s, chief, liaison, between, the, production, staff, and, the, research, team, cameraman, frankie, biondo, has, worked, on, sesame, street, from, its, first, episode, in, 1969, jim, henson, and, the, muppets, involvement, in, sesame, street, began, when, he, and, cooney, met, at, one, of, the, curriculum, planning, seminars, in, boston, author, christopher, finch, reported, that, stone, who, had, worked, with, henson, previously, felt, that, if, they, could, not, bring, him, on, board, they, should, make, do, without, puppets, henson, was, initially, reluctant, but, he, agreed, to, join, sesame, street, to, meet, his, own, social, goals, he, also, agreed, to, waive, his, performance, fee, for, full, ownership, of, the, sesame, street, muppets, and, to, split, any, revenue, they, generated, with, the, ctw, as, morrow, stated, henson, s, puppets, were, a, crucial, part, of, the, show, s, popularity, and, it, brought, henson, national, attention, davis, reported, that, henson, was, able, to, take, arcane, academic, goals, and, translate, them, to, effective, and, pleasurable, viewing, in, early, research, the, muppet, segments, of, the, show, scored, high, and, more, muppets, were, added, during, the, first, few, seasons, morrow, reported, that, the, muppets, were, effective, teaching, tools, because, children, easily, recognized, them, they, were, stereotypical, and, predictable, and, they, appealed, to, adults, and, older, siblings, sesame, street, is, best, known, for, the, creative, geniuses, it, attracted, people, like, jim, henson, and, joe, raposo, and, frank, oz, who, intuitively, grasped, what, it, takes, to, get, through, to, children, they, were, television, s, answer, to, beatrix, potter, or, l, frank, baum, or, dr, seuss, author, malcolm, gladwell, the, tipping, point, although, the, producers, decided, against, depending, upon, a, single, host, for, sesame, street, instead, casting, a, group, of, ethnically, diverse, actors, they, realized, that, a, children, s, television, program, needed, to, have, as, lesser, put, it, a, variety, of, distinctive, and, reliable, personalities, both, human, and, muppet, jon, stone, whose, goal, was, to, cast, white, actors, in, the, minority, was, responsible, for, hiring, the, show, s, first, cast, he, did, not, audition, actors, until, spring, 1969, a, few, weeks, before, the, five, test, shows, were, due, to, be, filmed, stone, videotaped, the, auditions, and, ed, palmer, took, them, out, into, the, field, to, test, children, s, reactions, the, actors, who, received, the, most, enthusiastic, thumbs, up, were, cast, for, example, loretta, long, was, chosen, to, play, susan, when, the, children, who, saw, her, audition, stood, up, and, sang, along, with, her, rendition, of, i, m, a, little, teapot, stone, stated, that, casting, was, the, only, aspect, of, the, show, that, was, just, completely, haphazard, most, of, the, cast, and, crew, found, jobs, on, sesame, street, through, personal, relationships, with, stone, and, the, other, producers, according, to, puppeteer, marty, robinson, in, 2019, longevity, was, common, among, the, show, s, cast, and, crew, according, to, the, ctw, s, research, children, preferred, watching, and, listening, to, other, children, more, than, to, puppets, and, adults, so, they, included, children, in, many, scenes, dave, connell, insisted, that, no, child, actors, be, used, so, these, children, were, non, professionals, unscripted, and, spontaneous, many, of, their, reactions, were, unpredictable, and, difficult, to, control, but, the, adult, cast, learned, to, handle, the, children, s, spontaneity, flexibly, even, when, it, resulted, in, departures, from, the, planned, script, or, lesson, ctw, research, also, revealed, that, the, children, s, hesitations, and, on, air, mistakes, served, as, models, for, viewers, according, to, morrow, this, resulted, in, the, show, having, a, fresh, quality, especially, in, its, early, years, when, sesame, street, premiered, on, november, 10, 1969, it, aired, on, only, 67, 6, of, american, televisions, but, it, earned, a, 3, 3, nielsen, rating, which, totaled, 1, 9, million, households, by, the, show, s, tenth, anniversary, in, 1979, nine, million, american, children, under, the, age, of, 6, were, watching, sesame, street, daily, according, to, a, 1993, survey, conducted, by, the, u, s, department, of, education, out, of, the, show, s, 6, 6, million, viewers, 2, 4, million, kindergartners, regularly, watched, it, 77, of, preschoolers, watched, it, once, a, week, and, 86, of, kindergartners, and, first, and, second, grade, students, had, watched, it, once, a, week, before, starting, school, the, show, reached, most, young, children, in, almost, all, demographic, groups, the, show, s, ratings, significantly, decreased, in, the, early, 1990s, due, to, changes, in, children, s, viewing, habits, and, in, the, television, marketplace, the, producers, responded, by, making, large, scale, structural, changes, to, the, show, by, 2006, sesame, street, had, become, the, most, widely, viewed, children, s, television, show, in, the, world, with, 20, international, independent, versions, and, broadcasts, in, over, 120, countries, a, 1996, survey, found, that, 95, of, all, american, preschoolers, had, watched, the, show, by, the, time, they, were, three, years, old, in, 2008, it, was, estimated, that, 77, million, americans, had, watched, the, series, as, children, by, the, show, s, 40th, anniversary, in, 2009, it, was, ranked, the, fifteenth, most, popular, children, s, show, on, television, and, by, its, 50th, anniversary, in, 2019, the, show, had, 100, brand, awareness, globally, in, 2018, the, show, was, the, second, highest, rated, program, on, pbs, kids, in, 2021, however, the, sesame, street, documentary, 50, years, of, sunny, days, which, was, broadcast, nationally, on, abc, did, not, fare, well, in, the, ratings, scoring, only, approximately, 2, 3, million, viewers, as, of, 2001, there, were, over, 1, 000, research, studies, regarding, sesame, street, s, efficacy, impact, and, effect, on, american, culture, the, ctw, solicited, the, educational, testing, service, ets, to, conduct, summative, research, on, the, show, ets, s, two, landmark, summative, evaluations, conducted, in, 1970, and, 1971, demonstrated, that, the, show, had, a, significant, educational, impact, on, its, viewers, these, studies, have, been, cited, in, other, studies, of, the, effects, of, television, on, young, children, additional, studies, conducted, throughout, sesame, street, s, history, demonstrated, that, the, show, continued, to, have, a, positive, effect, on, its, young, viewers, sesame, street, perhaps, the, most, vigorously, researched, vetted, and, fretted, over, program, on, the, planet, it, would, take, a, fork, lift, to, now, to, haul, away, the, load, of, scholarly, paper, devoted, to, the, series, author, michael, davis, lesser, believed, that, sesame, street, research, may, have, conferred, a, new, respectability, upon, the, studies, of, the, effects, of, visual, media, upon, children, he, also, believed, that, the, show, had, the, same, effect, on, the, prestige, of, producing, shows, for, children, in, the, television, industry, historian, robert, morrow, in, his, book, sesame, street, and, the, reform, of, children, s, television, which, chronicled, the, show, s, influence, on, children, s, television, and, on, the, television, industry, as, a, whole, reported, that, many, critics, of, commercial, television, saw, sesame, street, as, a, straightforward, illustration, for, reform, les, brown, a, writer, for, variety, saw, in, sesame, street, a, hope, for, a, more, substantial, future, for, television, morrow, reported, that, the, networks, responded, by, creating, more, high, quality, television, programs, but, that, many, critics, saw, them, as, appeasement, gestures, according, to, morrow, despite, the, ctw, model, s, effectiveness, in, creating, a, popular, show, commercial, television, made, only, a, limited, effort, to, emulate, ctw, s, methods, and, did, not, use, a, curriculum, or, evaluate, what, children, learned, from, them, by, the, mid, 1970s, commercial, television, had, abandoned, their, experiments, with, creating, better, children, s, programming, other, critics, hoped, that, sesame, street, with, its, depiction, of, a, functioning, multicultural, community, would, nurture, racial, tolerance, in, its, young, viewers, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 1990s, that, another, children, s, television, educational, program, blue, s, clues, used, the, ctw, s, methods, to, create, and, modify, their, content, the, creators, of, blue, s, clues, were, influenced, by, sesame, street, but, wanted, to, use, research, conducted, in, the, 30, years, since, its, debut, angela, santomero, one, of, its, producers, said, we, wanted, to, learn, from, sesame, street, and, take, it, one, step, further, critic, richard, roeper, said, that, perhaps, one, of, the, strongest, indicators, of, the, influence, of, sesame, street, has, been, the, enduring, rumors, and, urban, legends, surrounding, the, show, and, its, characters, especially, speculation, concerning, the, sexuality, of, bert, and, ernie, sesame, street, was, praised, from, its, debut, in, 1969, newsday, reported, that, several, newspapers, and, magazines, had, written, glowing, reports, about, the, ctw, and, cooney, the, press, overwhelmingly, praised, the, new, show, several, popular, magazines, and, niche, magazines, lauded, it, in, 1970, sesame, street, won,

awards, and, four, parents, choice, awards, it, was, the, subject, of, a, traveling, exhibition, by, the, smithsonian, institution, and, a, film, exhibition, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, sesame, street, is, with, lapses, the, most, intelligent, and, important, program, in, television, that, is, not, anything, much, yet, renata, adler, the, new, yorker, 1972, sesame, street, was, not, without, its, detractors, however, the, state, commission, in, mississippi, where, henson, was, from, operated, the, state, s, pbs, member, station, in, may, 1970, it, voted, to, not, air, sesame, street, because, of, its, highly, integrated, cast, of, children, which, the, commission, members, felt, mississippi, was, not, yet, ready, for, according, to, children, and, television, lesser, s, account, of, the, development, and, early, years, of, sesame, street, there, was, little, criticism, of, the, show, in, the, months, following, its, premiere, but, it, increased, at, the, end, of, its, first, season, and, beginning, of, the, second, season, historian, robert, w, morrow, speculated, that, much, of, the, early, criticism, which, he, called, surprisingly, intense, stemmed, from, cultural, and, historical, reasons, in, regards, to, as, he, put, it, the, place, of, children, in, american, society, and, the, controversies, about, television, s, effects, on, them, according, to, morrow, the, most, important, studies, finding, negative, effects, of, sesame, street, were, conducted, by, educator, herbert, a, sprigle, and, psychologist, thomas, d, cook, during, its, first, two, seasons, social, scientist, and, head, start, founder, urie, bronfenbrenner, criticized, the, show, for, being, too, wholesome, psychologist, leon, eisenberg, saw, sesame, street, s, urban, setting, as, superficial, and, having, little, to, do, with, the, problems, confronted, by, the, inner, city, child, head, start, director, edward, zigler, was, probably, sesame, street, s, most, vocal, critic, in, the, show, s, early, years, in, spite, of, their, commitment, to, multiculturalism, the, ctw, experienced, conflicts, with, the, leadership, of, minority, groups, especially, latino, groups, and, feminists, who, objected, to, sesame, street, s, depiction, of, latinos, and, women, the, ctw, took, steps, to, address, their, objections, by, 1971, the, ctw, hired, hispanic, actors, production, staff, and, researchers, and, by, the, mid, 1970s, morrow, reported, that, the, show, included, chicano, and, puerto, rican, cast, members, films, about, mexican, holidays, and, foods, and, cartoons, that, taught, spanish, words, as, the, new, york, times, has, stated, creating, strong, female, characters, that, make, kids, laugh, but, not, as, female, stereotypes, has, been, a, challenge, for, the, producers, of, sesame, street, according, to, morrow, change, regarding, how, women, and, girls, were, depicted, on, sesame, street, occurred, slowly, as, more, female, muppet, performers, like, camille, bonora, fran, brill, pam, arciero, carmen, osbahr, stephanie, d, abruzzo, jennifer, barnhart, and, leslie, carrara, rudolph, were, hired, and, trained, stronger, female, characters, like,
