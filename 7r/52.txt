logistics, is, the, part, of, supply, chain, management, that, deals, with, the, efficient, forward, and, reverse, flow, of, goods, services, and, related, information, from, the, point, of, origin, to, the, point, of, consumption, according, to, the, needs, of, customers, logistics, management, is, a, component, that, holds, the, supply, chain, together, the, resources, managed, in, logistics, may, include, tangible, goods, such, as, materials, equipment, and, supplies, as, well, as, food, and, other, consumable, items, in, military, logistics, it, is, concerned, with, maintaining, army, supply, lines, with, food, armaments, ammunition, and, spare, parts, apart, from, the, transportation, of, troops, themselves, meanwhile, civil, logistics, deals, with, acquiring, moving, and, storing, raw, materials, semi, finished, goods, and, finished, goods, for, organisations, that, provide, garbage, collection, mail, deliveries, public, utilities, and, after, sales, services, logistical, problems, must, be, addressed, logistics, deals, with, the, movements, of, materials, or, products, from, one, facility, to, another, it, does, not, include, material, flow, within, the, production, or, assembly, plants, such, as, production, planning, or, single, machine, scheduling, logistics, occupies, a, significant, amount, of, the, operational, cost, of, an, organisation, or, country, logistical, costs, of, organizations, in, the, united, states, incurred, about, 11, of, the, united, states, national, gross, domestic, product, gdp, as, of, 1997, in, the, european, union, logistics, costs, were, 8, 8, to, 11, 5, of, gdp, as, of, 1993, dedicated, simulation, software, can, model, analyze, visualize, and, optimize, logistics, complexity, minimizing, resource, use, is, a, common, motivation, in, all, logistics, fields, a, professional, working, in, logistics, management, is, called, a, logistician, the, term, logistics, is, attested, in, english, from, 1846, and, is, from, french, logistique, where, it, was, either, coined, or, popularized, by, swiss, military, officer, and, writer, antoine, henri, jomini, who, defined, it, in, his, summary, of, the, art, of, war, pr, cis, de, l, art, de, la, guerre, the, term, appears, in, the, 1830, edition, then, titled, analytic, table, tableau, analytique, and, jomini, explains, that, it, is, derived, from, french, logis, lit, lodgings, cognate, to, english, lodge, in, the, terms, french, mar, chal, des, logis, lit, marshall, of, lodgings, and, french, major, g, n, ral, des, logis, lit, major, general, of, lodging, autrefois, les, officiers, de, l, tat, major, se, nommaient, mar, chal, des, logis, major, g, n, ral, des, logis, de, l, est, venu, le, terme, de, logistique, qu, on, emploie, pour, d, signer, ce, qui, se, rapporte, aux, marches, d, une, arm, e, formerly, the, officers, of, the, general, staff, were, named, marshall, of, lodgings, major, general, of, lodgings, from, there, came, the, term, of, logistics, which, we, employ, to, designate, those, who, are, in, charge, of, the, functioning, of, an, army, the, term, is, credited, to, jomini, and, the, term, and, its, etymology, criticized, by, georges, de, chambray, in, 1832, writing, logistique, ce, mot, me, para, t, tre, tout, fait, nouveau, car, je, ne, l, avais, encore, vu, nulle, part, dans, la, litt, rature, militaire, il, para, t, le, faire, d, river, du, mot, logis, tymologie, singuli, re, logistic, this, word, appears, to, me, to, be, completely, new, as, i, have, not, yet, seen, it, anywhere, in, military, literature, he, appears, to, derive, it, from, the, word, lodgings, a, peculiar, etymology, chambray, also, notes, that, the, term, logistique, was, present, in, the, dictionnaire, de, l, acad, mie, fran, aise, as, a, synonym, for, algebra, the, french, word, logistique, is, a, homonym, of, the, existing, mathematical, term, from, ancient, greek, romanized, logistik, s, a, traditional, division, of, greek, mathematics, the, mathematical, term, is, presumably, the, origin, of, the, term, logistic, in, logistic, growth, and, related, terms, some, sources, give, this, instead, as, the, source, of, logistics, either, ignorant, of, jomini, s, statement, that, it, was, derived, from, logis, or, dubious, and, instead, believing, it, was, in, fact, of, greek, origin, or, influenced, by, the, existing, term, of, greek, origin, jomini, originally, defined, logistics, as, l, art, de, bien, ordonner, les, marches, d, une, arm, e, de, bien, combiner, l, ordre, des, troupes, dans, les, colonnes, les, tems, de, leur, d, part, leur, itin, raire, les, moyens, de, communications, n, cessaires, pour, assurer, leur, arriv, e, point, nomm, the, art, of, well, ordering, the, functionings, of, an, army, of, well, combining, the, order, of, troops, in, columns, the, times, of, their, departure, their, itinerary, the, means, of, communication, necessary, to, assure, their, arrival, at, a, named, point, the, oxford, english, dictionary, defines, logistics, as, the, branch, of, military, science, relating, to, procuring, maintaining, and, transporting, material, personnel, and, facilities, however, the, new, oxford, american, dictionary, defines, logistics, as, the, detailed, coordination, of, a, complex, operation, involving, many, people, facilities, or, supplies, and, the, oxford, dictionary, on, line, defines, it, as, the, detailed, organization, and, implementation, of, a, complex, operation, as, such, logistics, is, commonly, seen, as, a, branch, of, engineering, that, creates, people, systems, rather, than, machine, systems, according, to, the, council, of, supply, chain, management, professionals, previously, the, council, of, logistics, management, logistics, is, the, process, of, planning, implementing, and, controlling, procedures, for, the, efficient, and, effective, transportation, and, storage, of, goods, including, services, and, related, information, from, the, point, of, origin, to, the, point, of, consumption, for, the, purpose, of, conforming, to, customer, requirements, and, includes, inbound, outbound, internal, and, external, movements, academics, and, practitioners, traditionally, refer, to, the, terms, operations, or, production, management, when, referring, to, physical, transformations, taking, place, in, a, single, business, location, factory, restaurant, or, even, bank, clerking, and, reserve, the, term, logistics, for, activities, related, to, distribution, that, is, moving, products, on, the, territory, managing, a, distribution, center, is, seen, therefore, as, pertaining, to, the, realm, of, logistics, since, while, in, theory, the, products, made, by, a, factory, are, ready, for, consumption, they, still, need, to, be, moved, along, the, distribution, network, according, to, some, logic, and, the, distribution, center, aggregates, and, processes, orders, coming, from, different, areas, of, the, territory, that, being, said, from, a, modeling, perspective, there, are, similarities, between, operations, management, and, logistics, and, companies, sometimes, use, hybrid, professionals, with, for, example, a, director, of, operations, or, a, logistics, officer, working, on, similar, problems, furthermore, the, term, supply, chain, management, originally, referred, to, among, other, issues, having, an, integrated, vision, of, both, production, and, logistics, from, point, of, origin, to, point, of, production, all, these, terms, may, suffer, from, semantic, change, as, a, side, effect, of, advertising, logistical, activities, can, be, divided, into, three, main, areas, order, processing, inventory, management, and, freight, transportation, traditionally, order, processing, was, a, time, consuming, activity, that, could, take, up, to, 70, of, the, order, cycle, time, however, with, new, technologies, such, as, bar, code, scanning, computers, and, network, connection, customer, orders, can, quickly, reach, the, seller, in, no, time, and, the, availability, of, stocks, can, be, checked, in, real, time, the, purpose, of, having, an, inventory, is, to, reduce, the, overall, logistical, cost, while, improving, service, to, customers, having, a, stockpile, of, finished, goods, beforehand, can, reduce, the, frequency, of, transportation, to, and, from, the, customers, and, cope, with, the, randomness, of, customer, demands, however, maintaining, an, inventory, requires, capital, investment, in, finished, goods, and, maintaining, a, warehouse, storage, and, order, picking, occupy, most, of, the, warehouse, maintenance, cost, freight, transportation, forms, a, vital, part, of, logistics, and, allows, access, to, broad, markets, as, goods, can, be, transported, to, hundreds, or, thousands, of, kilometers, away, freight, transportation, accounts, for, two, thirds, of, logistical, costs, and, significantly, impacts, customer, service, transportation, policies, and, warehouse, management, are, closely, intertwined, the, rise, of, commercial, transactions, through, the, internet, gives, rise, to, the, need, for, e, logistics, compared, to, traditional, logistics, e, logistics, handles, parcels, valued, at, less, than, a, hundred, us, dollars, to, customers, scattered, at, various, destinations, worldwide, in, e, logistics, customers, demands, come, in, waves, when, compared, to, traditional, logistics, where, the, demand, is, consistent, inbound, logistics, is, one, of, the, primary, logistics, processes, concentrating, on, purchasing, and, arranging, the, inbound, movement, of, materials, parts, or, unfinished, inventory, from, suppliers, to, manufacturing, or, assembly, plants, warehouses, or, retail, stores, outbound, logistics, is, the, process, related, to, the, storage, and, movement, of, the, final, product, the, related, information, flows, from, the, end, of, the, production, line, to, the, end, user, given, the, services, performed, by, logisticians, the, main, fields, of, logistics, can, be, broken, down, as, follows, procurement, logistics, consists, of, market, research, requirements, planning, make, or, buy, decisions, supplier, management, ordering, and, order, control, the, targets, in, procurement, logistics, might, be, contradictory, maximizing, efficiency, by, concentrating, on, core, competencies, outsourcing, while, maintaining, the, company, s, autonomy, or, minimizing, procurement, costs, while, maximizing, security, within, the, supply, process, advance, logistics, consists, of, the, activities, required, to, set, up, or, establish, a, plan, for, logistics, activities, to, occur, global, logistics, is, technically, the, process, of, managing, the, flow, of, goods, through, a, supply, chain, from, its, place, of, production, to, other, parts, of, the, world, this, often, requires, an, intermodal, transport, system, via, ocean, air, rail, and, truck, the, effectiveness, of, global, logistics, is, measured, in, the, logistics, performance, index, distribution, logistics, has, as, its, main, task, the, delivery, of, the, finished, products, to, the, customer, it, consists, of, order, processing, warehousing, and, transportation, distribution, logistics, is, necessary, because, production, time, place, and, quantity, differ, with, the, time, place, and, quantity, of, consumption, disposal, logistics, has, the, main, function, of, reducing, logistics, cost, s, and, enhancing, service, s, related, to, the, disposal, of, waste, produced, during, a, business, s, operation, reverse, logistics, denotes, all, those, reusing, products, and, materials, operations, the, reverse, logistics, process, includes, the, management, and, the, sale, of, surpluses, as, well, as, products, being, returned, to, vendors, from, buyers, it, is, the, process, of, planning, implementing, and, controlling, the, efficient, cost, effective, flow, of, raw, materials, in, process, inventory, finished, goods, and, related, information, from, the, point, of, consumption, to, the, point, of, origin, to, recapture, value, or, proper, disposal, more, precisely, reverse, logistics, moves, goods, from, their, typical, final, destination, to, capture, value, or, proper, disposal, the, opposite, of, reverse, logistics, is, forward, logistics, green, logistics, describes, all, attempts, to, measure, and, minimize, the, ecological, impact, of, logistics, activities, including, all, activities, of, the, forward, and, reverse, flows, this, can, be, achieved, through, intermodal, freight, transport, path, optimization, vehicle, saturation, and, city, logistics, ram, logistics, see, also, logistic, engineering, combines, both, business, logistics, and, military, logistics, since, it, concerns, highly, complicated, technological, systems, for, which, reliability, availability, and, maintainability, are, essential, e, g, weapon, system, and, military, supercomputers, asset, control, logistics, companies, in, the, retail, channels, both, organized, retailers, and, suppliers, often, deploy, assets, required, for, the, display, preservation, and, promotion, of, their, products, some, examples, are, refrigerators, stands, display, monitors, seasonal, equipment, poster, stands, frames, emergency, logistics, or, humanitarian, logistics, is, a, term, used, by, the, logistics, supply, chain, and, manufacturing, industries, to, denote, specific, time, critical, modes, of, transport, used, to, move, goods, rapidly, in, the, event, of, an, emergency, the, reason, for, enlisting, emergency, logistics, services, could, be, a, production, delay, or, anticipated, production, delay, or, an, urgent, need, for, specialized, equipment, to, prevent, events, such, as, aircraft, being, grounded, also, known, as, aircraft, on, ground, aog, ships, being, delayed, or, telecommunications, failure, humanitarian, logistics, involves, governments, the, military, aid, agencies, donors, non, governmental, organizations, and, emergency, logistics, services, are, typically, sourced, from, a, specialist, provider, the, term, production, logistics, describes, logistic, processes, within, a, value, adding, system, ex, a, factory, or, a, mine, production, logistics, aims, to, ensure, that, each, machine, and, workstation, receives, the, right, product, in, the, correct, quantity, and, quality, at, the, right, time, the, concern, is, with, production, testing, transportation, storage, and, supply, production, logistics, can, operate, in, existing, as, well, as, new, plants, since, manufacturing, in, an, existing, plant, is, a, constantly, changing, process, machines, are, exchanged, and, new, ones, added, which, allows, for, improving, the, production, logistics, system, accordingly, production, logistics, provides, the, means, to, achieve, customer, response, and, capital, efficiency, production, logistics, becomes, more, important, with, decreasing, batch, sizes, in, many, industries, e, g, mobile, phones, the, short, term, goal, is, a, batch, size, of, one, allowing, even, a, single, customer, s, demand, to, be, fulfilled, efficiently, track, and, tracing, which, is, an, essential, part, of, production, logistics, due, to, product, safety, and, reliability, issues, is, also, gaining, importance, especially, in, the, automotive, and, medical, industries, construction, logistics, has, been, employed, by, civilizations, for, thousands, of, years, as, the, various, human, civilizations, tried, to, build, the, best, possible, works, of, construction, for, living, and, protection, now, construction, logistics, has, emerged, as, a, vital, part, of, construction, in, the, past, few, years, construction, logistics, has, emerged, as, a, different, field, of, knowledge, and, study, within, supply, chain, management, and, logistics, the, seven, r, s, is, a, popular, concept, used, to, enforce, best, practices, in, logistics, management, which, consists, of, the, following, in, military, science, maintaining, one, s, supply, lines, while, disrupting, those, of, the, enemy, is, a, crucial, some, would, say, the, most, crucial, element, of, military, strategy, since, an, armed, force, without, resources, and, transportation, is, defenseless, the, historical, leaders, hannibal, alexander, the, great, and, the, duke, of, wellington, are, considered, to, have, been, logistical, geniuses, alexander, s, expedition, benefited, considerably, from, his, meticulous, attention, to, the, provisioning, of, his, army, hannibal, is, credited, to, have, taught, logistics, to, the, romans, during, the, punic, wars, and, the, success, of, the, anglo, portuguese, army, in, the, peninsula, war, was, due, to, the, effectiveness, of, wellington, s, supply, system, despite, the, numerical, disadvantage, the, defeat, of, the, british, in, the, american, war, of, independence, and, the, defeat, of, the, axis, in, the, african, theater, of, world, war, ii, are, attributed, by, some, scholars, to, logistical, failures, militaries, have, a, significant, need, for, logistics, solutions, and, so, have, developed, advanced, implementations, integrated, logistics, support, ils, is, a, discipline, used, in, military, industries, to, ensure, an, easily, supportable, system, with, a, robust, customer, service, logistic, concept, at, the, lowest, cost, and, in, line, with, often, high, reliability, availability, maintainability, and, other, requirements, as, defined, for, the, project, in, military, logistics, logistics, officers, manage, how, and, when, to, move, resources, to, the, places, they, are, needed, supply, chain, management, in, military, logistics, often, deals, with, a, number, of, variables, in, predicting, cost, deterioration, consumption, and, future, demand, the, united, states, armed, forces, categorical, supply, classification, was, developed, in, such, a, way, that, categories, of, supply, with, similar, consumption, variables, are, grouped, together, for, planning, purposes, for, instance, peacetime, consumption, of, ammunition, and, fuel, will, be, considerably, lower, than, wartime, consumption, of, these, items, whereas, other, classes, of, supply, such, as, subsistence, and, clothing, have, a, relatively, consistent, consumption, rate, regardless, of, war, or, peace, some, classes, of, supply, have, a, linear, demand, relationship, as, more, troops, are, added, more, supply, items, are, needed, or, as, more, equipment, is, used, more, fuel, and, ammunition, are, consumed, other, classes, of, supply, must, consider, a, third, variable, besides, usage, and, quantity, time, as, equipment, ages, more, and, more, repair, parts, are, needed, over, time, even, when, usage, and, quantity, stay, consistent, by, recording, and, analyzing, these, trends, over, time, and, applying, them, to, future, scenarios, the, us, armed, forces, can, accurately, supply, troops, with, the, items, necessary, at, the, precise, moment, they, are, needed, history, has, shown, that, good, logistical, planning, creates, a, lean, and, efficient, fighting, force, the, lack, thereof, can, lead, to, a, clunky, slow, and, ill, equipped, force, with, too, much, or, too, little, supply, one, definition, of, business, logistics, speaks, of, having, the, right, item, in, the, right, quantity, at, the, right, time, at, the, right, place, for, the, right, price, in, the, right, condition, to, the, right, customer, business, logistics, incorporates, all, industry, sectors, and, aims, to, manage, the, fruition, of, project, life, cycles, supply, chains, and, resultant, efficiencies, the, term, business, logistics, has, evolved, since, the, 1960s, due, to, the, increasing, complexity, of, supplying, businesses, with, materials, and, shipping, out, products, in, an, increasingly, globalized, supply, chain, leading, to, a, call, for, professionals, called, supply, chain, logisticians, in, business, logistics, may, have, either, an, internal, focus, inbound, logistics, or, an, external, focus, outbound, logistics, covering, the, flow, and, storage, of, materials, from, point, of, origin, to, point, of, consumption, a, key, factor, in, supply, chain, management, the, main, functions, of, a, qualified, logistician, include, inventory, management, purchasing, transportation, warehousing, consultation, and, the, organizing, and, planning, of, these, activities, logisticians, combine, professional, knowledge, of, each, of, these, functions, to, coordinate, resources, in, an, organization, there, are, two, fundamentally, different, forms, of, logistics, one, optimizes, a, steady, flow, of, material, through, a, network, of, transport, links, and, storage, nodes, while, the, other, coordinates, a, sequence, of, resources, to, carry, out, some, project, such, as, restructuring, a, warehouse, a, distribution, network, would, require, several, intermediaries, to, bring, consumer, or, industrial, goods, from, manufacturers, to, a, user, intermediaries, would, markup, the, costs, of, the, products, during, distribution, but, benefit, users, by, providing, lower, transportation, costs, than, the, manufacturers, the, number, of, intermediaries, required, for, the, distribution, network, depends, upon, the, types, of, goods, being, distributed, for, example, consumer, goods, such, as, cosmetics, and, handicrafts, may, not, require, any, intermediaries, as, they, can, be, sold, door, to, door, or, can, be, obtained, from, local, flea, markets, for, industrial, goods, such, as, raw, materials, and, equipment, intermediaries, are, not, needed, because, manufacturers, can, sell, a, large, number, of, goods, to, a, user, generally, there, are, three, types, of, intermediaries, namely, agent, broker, wholesaler, and, retailer, the, nodes, of, a, distribution, network, include, a, logistic, family, is, a, set, of, products, that, share, a, common, characteristic, weight, and, volumetric, characteristics, physical, storing, needs, temperature, radiation, etc, handling, needs, order, frequency, package, size, etc, the, following, metrics, may, be, used, by, the, company, to, organize, its, products, in, different, families, other, metrics, may, present, themselves, in, both, physical, or, monetary, form, such, as, the, standard, inventory, turnover, unit, loads, are, combinations, of, individual, items, which, are, moved, by, handling, systems, usually, employing, a, pallet, of, normed, dimensions, handling, systems, include, trans, pallet, handlers, counterweight, handler, retractable, mast, handler, bilateral, handlers, trilateral, handlers, agv, and, other, handlers, storage, systems, include, pile, stocking, cell, racks, either, static, or, movable, cantilever, racks, and, gravity, racks, order, processing, is, a, sequential, process, involving, processing, withdrawal, list, picking, selective, removal, of, items, from, loading, units, sorting, assembling, items, based, on, the, destination, package, formation, weighting, labeling, and, packing, order, consolidation, gathering, packages, into, loading, units, for, transportation, control, and, bill, of, lading, picking, can, be, both, manual, or, automated, manual, picking, can, be, both, man, to, goods, i, e, operator, using, a, cart, or, conveyor, belt, or, goods, to, man, i, e, the, operator, benefiting, from, the, presence, of, a, mini, load, asrs, vertical, or, horizontal, carousel, or, from, an, automatic, vertical, storage, system, avss, automatic, picking, is, done, either, with, dispensers, or, depalletizing, robots, sorting, can, be, done, manually, through, carts, or, conveyor, belts, or, automatically, through, sorters, consolidating, small, shipments, into, large, shipments, can, help, to, save, transportation, costs, there, are, three, methods, to, do, this, facility, consolidation, multi, stop, consolidation, and, temporal, consolidation, facility, consolidation, uses, the, economics, of, scale, by, transporting, small, shipments, over, short, distances, and, large, shipments, over, long, distances, multi, stop, consolidation, makes, multiple, stops, to, consolidate, small, shipments, in, the, case, of, less, than, truckload, shipping, temporal, consolidation, adjusts, the, shipping, schedules, forwards, or, backward, so, as, to, make, a, single, large, shipment, rather, than, several, small, shipments, over, time, cargo, can, be, consolidated, into, pallets, or, containers, there, are, five, basic, modes, of, transport, namely, ship, rail, truck, air, and, pipeline, operated, by, different, carrier, these, shipping, methods, can, be, combined, in, various, ways, such, as, intermodal, transport, no, handling, multimodal, transport, and, combined, transport, minimal, road, transport, a, shipper, chooses, a, carrier, by, taking, into, account, the, total, cost, of, shipment, and, transit, time, air, is, the, most, expensive, type, of, transport, followed, by, truck, rail, pipeline, and, ship, cargo, can, be, organized, in, different, shipment, categories, unit, loads, are, usually, assembled, into, higher, standardized, units, such, as, iso, containers, swap, bodies, or, semi, trailers, especially, for, very, long, distances, product, transportation, will, likely, benefit, from, using, different, transportation, means, when, moving, cargo, typical, constraints, are, maximum, weight, and, volume, operators, involved, in, transportation, include, all, train, road, vehicles, boats, airplanes, companies, couriers, freight, forwarders, and, multi, modal, transport, operators, merchandise, being, transported, internationally, is, usually, subject, to, the, incoterms, standards, issued, by, the, international, chamber, of, commerce, in, the, logistics, business, a, logistical, system, is, designed, at, a, minimum, cost, based, on, the, expected, customer, service, level, as, the, service, improves, the, number, of, sales, also, increased, as, service, is, further, improved, more, sales, are, captured, from, competing, providers, further, increase, in, customer, service, levels, after, these, only, increases, sales, marginally, similarly, to, production, systems, logistic, systems, need, to, be, properly, configured, and, managed, actually, a, number, of, methodologies, have, been, directly, borrowed, from, operations, management, such, as, using, economic, order, quantity, models, for, managing, inventory, in, the, nodes, of, the, network, distribution, resource, planning, drp, is, similar, to, mrp, except, that, it, does, not, concern, activities, inside, the, nodes, of, the, network, but, planning, distribution, when, moving, goods, through, the, links, of, the, network, traditionally, in, logistics, configuration, may, be, at, the, level, of, the, warehouse, node, or, at, level, of, the, distribution, system, network, regarding, a, single, warehouse, besides, the, issue, of, designing, and, building, the, warehouse, configuration, means, solving, a, number, of, interrelated, technical, economic, problems, dimensioning, rack, cells, choosing, a, palletizing, method, manual, or, through, robots, rack, dimensioning, and, design, number, of, racks, number, and, typology, of, retrieval, systems, e, g, stacker, cranes, some, important, constraints, have, to, be, satisfied, fork, and, load, beams, resistance, to, bending, and, proper, placement, of, sprinklers, although, picking, is, more, of, a, tactical, planning, decision, than, a, configuration, problem, it, is, important, to, take, it, into, account, when, deciding, the, layout, of, the, racks, inside, the, warehouse, and, buying, tools, such, as, handlers, and, motorized, carts, since, once, those, decisions, are, taken, they, will, work, as, constraints, when, managing, the, warehouse, the, same, reasoning, for, sorting, when, designing, the, conveyor, system, or, installing, automatic, dispensers, configuration, at, the, level, of, the, distribution, system, concerns, primarily, the, problem, of, location, of, the, nodes, in, geographic, space, and, distribution, of, capacity, among, the, nodes, the, first, may, be, referred, to, as, facility, location, with, the, special, case, of, site, selection, while, the, latter, to, as, capacity, allocation, the, problem, of, outsourcing, typically, arises, at, this, level, the, nodes, of, a, supply, chain, are, very, rarely, owned, by, a, single, enterprise, distribution, networks, can, be, characterized, by, numbers, of, levels, namely, the, number, of, intermediary, nodes, between, supplier, and, consumer, this, distinction, is, more, useful, for, modeling, purposes, but, it, relates, also, to, a, tactical, decision, regarding, safety, stocks, considering, a, two, level, network, if, safety, inventory, is, kept, only, in, peripheral, warehouses, then, it, is, called, a, dependent, system, from, suppliers, if, safety, inventory, is, distributed, among, central, and, peripheral, warehouses, it, is, called, an, independent, system, from, suppliers, transportation, from, producer, to, the, second, level, is, called, primary, transportation, from, the, second, level, to, a, consumer, is, called, secondary, transportation, although, configuring, a, distribution, network, from, zero, is, possible, logisticians, usually, have, to, deal, with, restructuring, existing, networks, due, to, presence, of, an, array, of, factors, changing, demand, product, or, process, innovation, opportunities, for, outsourcing, change, of, government, policy, toward, trade, barriers, innovation, in, transportation, means, both, vehicles, or, thoroughfares, the, introduction, of, regulations, notably, those, regarding, pollution, and, availability, of, ict, supporting, systems, such, as, erp, or, e, commerce, once, a, logistic, system, is, configured, management, meaning, tactical, decisions, takes, place, once, again, at, the, level, of, the, warehouse, and, of, the, distribution, network, decisions, have, to, be, made, under, a, set, of, constraints, internal, such, as, using, the, available, infrastructure, or, external, such, as, complying, with, the, given, product, shelf, lifes, and, expiration, dates, at, the, warehouse, level, the, logistician, must, decide, how, to, distribute, merchandise, over, the, racks, three, basic, situations, are, traditionally, considered, shared, storage, dedicated, storage, rack, space, reserved, for, specific, merchandise, and, class, based, storage, class, meaning, merchandise, organized, in, different, areas, according, to, their, access, index, picking, efficiency, varies, greatly, depending, on, the, situation, for, a, man, to, goods, situation, a, distinction, is, carried, out, between, high, level, picking, vertical, component, significant, and, low, level, picking, vertical, component, insignificant, a, number, of, tactical, decisions, regarding, picking, must, be, made, at, the, level, of, the, distribution, network, tactical, decisions, involve, mainly, inventory, control, and, delivery, path, optimization, note, that, the, logistician, may, be, required, to, manage, the, reverse, flow, along, with, the, forward, flow, warehouse, management, systems, wms, can, differ, significantly, from, warehouse, control, systems, wcs, although, there, is, some, overlap, in, functionality, a, wms, plans, a, weekly, activity, forecast, based, on, such, factors, as, statistics, and, trends, whereas, a, wcs, acts, like, a, floor, supervisor, working, in, real, time, to, get, the, job, done, by, the, most, effective, means, for, example, a, wms, can, tell, the, system, that, it, is, going, to, need, five, of, stock, keeping, unit, sku, a, and, five, of, sku, b, hours, in, advance, but, by, the, time, it, acts, other, considerations, may, have, come, into, play, or, there, could, be, a, logjam, on, a, conveyor, a, wcs, can, prevent, that, problem, by, working, in, real, time, and, adapting, to, the, situation, by, making, a, last, minute, decision, based, on, current, activity, and, operational, status, working, synergistically, wms, and, wcs, can, resolve, these, issues, and, maximize, efficiency, for, companies, that, rely, on, the, effective, operation, of, their, warehouse, or, distribution, center, logistics, outsourcing, involves, a, relationship, between, a, company, and, an, lsp, logistic, service, provider, which, compared, with, basic, logistics, services, has, more, customized, offerings, encompasses, a, broad, number, of, service, activities, is, characterized, by, a, long, term, orientation, and, thus, has, a, strategic, nature, outsourcing, does, not, have, to, be, complete, externalization, to, an, lsp, but, can, also, be, partial, third, party, logistics, 3pl, involves, using, external, organizations, to, execute, logistics, activities, that, have, traditionally, been, performed, within, an, organization, itself, according, to, this, definition, third, party, logistics, includes, any, form, of, outsourcing, of, logistics, activities, previously, performed, in, house, for, example, if, a, company, with, its, own, warehousing, facilities, decides, to, employ, external, transportation, this, would, be, an, example, of, third, party, logistics, logistics, is, an, emerging, business, area, in, many, countries, external, 3pl, providers, have, evolved, from, merely, providing, logistics, capabilities, to, becoming, real, orchestrators, of, supply, chains, that, create, and, sustain, a, competitive, advantage, thus, bringing, about, new, levels, of, logistics, outsourcing, the, concept, of, a, fourth, party, logistics, 4pl, provider, was, first, defined, by, andersen, consulting, now, accenture, as, an, integrator, that, assembles, the, resources, planning, capabilities, and, technology, of, its, own, organization, and, other, organizations, to, design, build, and, run, comprehensive, supply, chain, solutions, whereas, a, third, party, logistics, 3pl, service, provider, targets, a, single, function, a, 4pl, targets, management, of, the, entire, process, some, have, described, a, 4pl, as, a, general, contractor, that, manages, other, 3pls, truckers, forwarders, custom, house, agents, and, others, essentially, taking, responsibility, of, a, complete, process, for, the, customer, horizontal, business, alliances, often, occur, between, logistics, service, providers, i, e, the, cooperation, between, two, or, more, logistics, companies, that, are, potentially, competing, in, a, horizontal, alliance, these, partners, can, benefit, twofold, on, one, hand, they, can, access, tangible, resources, which, are, directly, exploitable, in, this, example, extending, common, transportation, networks, their, warehouse, infrastructure, and, the, ability, to, provide, more, complex, service, packages, can, be, achieved, by, combining, resources, on, the, other, hand, partners, can, access, intangible, resources, which, are, not, directly, exploitable, this, typically, includes, know, how, and, information, and, in, turn, innovation, logistics, automation, is, the, application, of, computer, software, or, automated, machinery, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, logistics, operations, this, typically, refers, to, operations, within, a, warehouse, or, distribution, center, with, broader, tasks, undertaken, by, supply, chain, engineering, systems, and, enterprise, resource, planning, systems, industrial, machinery, can, typically, identify, products, through, either, barcode, or, rfid, technologies, information, in, traditional, bar, codes, is, stored, as, a, sequence, of, black, and, white, bars, varying, in, width, which, when, read, by, laser, is, translated, into, a, digital, sequence, which, according, to, fixed, rules, can, be, converted, into, a, decimal, number, or, other, data, sometimes, information, in, a, bar, code, can, be, transmitted, through, radio, frequency, more, typically, radio, transmission, is, used, in, rfid, tags, an, rfid, tag, is, a, card, containing, a, memory, chip, and, an, antenna, that, transmits, signals, to, a, reader, rfid, may, be, found, on, merchandise, animals, vehicles, and, people, as, well, a, logistician, is, a, professional, logistics, practitioner, professional, logisticians, are, often, certified, by, professional, associations, one, can, either, work, in, a, pure, logistics, company, such, as, a, shipping, line, airport, or, freight, forwarder, or, within, the, logistics, department, of, a, company, however, as, mentioned, above, logistics, is, a, broad, field, encompassing, procurement, production, distribution, and, disposal, activities, hence, career, perspectives, are, broad, as, well, a, new, trend, in, the, industry, is, the, 4pl, or, fourth, party, logistics, firms, consulting, companies, offering, logistics, services, some, universities, and, academic, institutions, train, students, as, logisticians, offering, undergraduate, and, postgraduate, programs, a, university, with, a, primary, focus, on, logistics, is, k, hne, logistics, university, in, hamburg, germany, it, is, non, profit, and, supported, by, k, hne, foundation, of, the, logistics, entrepreneur, klaus, michael, k, hne, the, chartered, institute, of, logistics, and, transport, cilt, established, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1919, received, a, royal, charter, in, 1926, the, chartered, institute, is, one, of, the, professional, bodies, or, institutions, for, the, logistics, and, transport, sectors, that, offer, professional, qualifications, or, degrees, in, logistics, management, cilt, programs, can, be, studied, at, centers, around, the, uk, some, of, which, also, offer, distance, learning, options, the, institute, also, have, overseas, branches, namely, the, chartered, institute, of, logistics, transport, australia, cilta, in, australia, and, chartered, institute, of, logistics, and, transport, in, hong, kong, cilthk, in, hong, kong, in, the, uk, logistics, management, programs, are, conducted, by, many, universities, and, professional, bodies, such, as, cilt, these, programs, are, generally, offered, at, the, postgraduate, level, the, global, institute, of, logistics, established, in, new, york, in, 2003, is, a, think, tank, for, the, profession, and, is, primarily, concerned, with, intercontinental, maritime, logistics, it, is, particularly, concerned, with, container, logistics, and, the, role, of, the, seaport, authority, in, the, maritime, logistics, chain, the, international, association, of, public, health, logisticians, iaphl, is, a, professional, network, that, promotes, the, professional, development, of, supply, chain, managers, and, others, working, in, the, field, of, public, health, logistics, and, commodity, security, with, particular, focus, on, developing, countries, the, association, supports, logisticians, worldwide, by, providing, a, community, of, practice, where, members, can, network, exchange, ideas, and, improve, their, professional, skills, there, are, many, museums, in, the, world, which, cover, various, aspects, of, practical, logistics, these, include, museums, of, transportation, customs, packing, and, industry, based, logistics, however, only, the, following, museums, are, fully, dedicated, to, logistics, general, logistics, military, logistics
