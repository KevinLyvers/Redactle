humour, commonwealth, english, or, humor, american, english, is, the, tendency, of, experiences, to, provoke, laughter, and, provide, amusement, the, term, derives, from, the, humoral, medicine, of, the, ancient, greeks, which, taught, that, the, balance, of, fluids, in, the, human, body, known, as, humours, latin, humor, body, fluid, controlled, human, health, and, emotion, people, of, all, ages, and, cultures, respond, to, humour, most, people, are, able, to, experience, humour, be, amused, smile, or, laugh, at, something, funny, such, as, a, pun, or, joke, and, thus, are, considered, to, have, a, sense, of, humour, the, hypothetical, person, lacking, a, sense, of, humour, would, likely, find, the, behaviour, to, be, inexplicable, strange, or, even, irrational, though, ultimately, decided, by, subjective, personal, taste, the, extent, to, which, a, person, finds, something, humorous, depends, on, a, host, of, variables, including, geographical, location, culture, maturity, level, of, education, intelligence, and, context, for, example, young, children, may, favour, slapstick, such, as, punch, and, judy, puppet, shows, or, cartoons, such, as, tom, and, jerry, or, looney, tunes, whose, physical, nature, makes, it, accessible, to, them, by, contrast, more, sophisticated, forms, of, humour, such, as, satire, require, an, understanding, of, its, social, meaning, and, context, and, thus, tend, to, appeal, to, a, more, mature, audience, many, theories, exist, about, what, humour, is, and, what, social, function, it, serves, the, prevailing, types, of, theories, attempting, to, account, for, the, existence, of, humour, include, psychological, theories, the, vast, majority, of, which, consider, humour, induced, behaviour, to, be, very, healthy, spiritual, theories, which, may, for, instance, consider, humour, to, be, a, gift, from, god, and, theories, which, consider, humour, to, be, an, unexplainable, mystery, very, much, like, a, mystical, experience, the, benign, violation, theory, endorsed, by, peter, mcgraw, attempts, to, explain, humour, s, existence, the, theory, says, humour, only, occurs, when, something, seems, wrong, unsettling, or, threatening, but, simultaneously, seems, okay, acceptable, or, safe, humour, can, be, used, as, a, method, to, easily, engage, in, social, interaction, by, taking, away, that, awkward, uncomfortable, or, uneasy, feeling, of, social, interactions, others, believe, that, the, appropriate, use, of, humour, can, facilitate, social, interactions, some, claim, that, humour, should, not, be, explained, author, e, b, white, once, said, humor, can, be, dissected, as, a, frog, can, but, the, thing, dies, in, the, process, and, the, innards, are, discouraging, to, any, but, the, pure, scientific, mind, counter, to, this, argument, protests, against, offensive, cartoons, invite, the, dissection, of, humour, or, its, lack, by, aggrieved, individuals, and, communities, this, process, of, dissecting, humour, does, not, necessarily, banish, a, sense, of, humour, but, directs, attention, towards, its, politics, and, assumed, universality, arthur, schopenhauer, lamented, the, misuse, of, humour, a, german, loanword, from, english, to, mean, any, type, of, comedy, however, both, humour, and, comic, are, often, used, when, theorising, about, the, subject, the, connotations, of, humour, as, opposed, to, comic, are, said, to, be, that, of, response, versus, stimulus, additionally, humour, was, thought, to, include, a, combination, of, ridiculousness, and, wit, in, an, individual, the, paradigmatic, case, being, shakespeare, s, sir, john, falstaff, the, french, were, slow, to, adopt, the, term, humour, in, french, humeur, and, humour, are, still, two, different, words, the, former, referring, to, a, person, s, mood, or, to, the, archaic, concept, of, the, four, humours, non, satirical, humour, can, be, specifically, termed, droll, humour, or, recreational, drollery, as, with, any, art, form, the, acceptance, of, a, particular, style, or, incidence, of, humour, depends, on, sociological, factors, and, varies, from, person, to, person, throughout, history, comedy, has, been, used, as, a, form, of, entertainment, all, over, the, world, whether, in, the, courts, of, the, western, kings, or, the, villages, of, the, far, east, both, a, social, etiquette, and, a, certain, intelligence, can, be, displayed, through, forms, of, wit, and, sarcasm, eighteenth, century, german, author, georg, lichtenberg, said, that, the, more, you, know, humour, the, more, you, become, demanding, in, fineness, western, humour, theory, begins, with, plato, who, attributed, to, socrates, as, a, semi, historical, dialogue, character, in, the, philebus, p, 49b, the, view, that, the, essence, of, the, ridiculous, is, an, ignorance, in, the, weak, who, are, thus, unable, to, retaliate, when, ridiculed, later, in, greek, philosophy, aristotle, in, the, poetics, 1449a, pp, 34, 35, suggested, that, an, ugliness, that, does, not, disgust, is, fundamental, to, humour, in, ancient, sanskrit, drama, bharata, muni, s, natya, shastra, defined, humour, h, syam, as, one, of, the, nine, nava, rasas, or, principle, rasas, emotional, responses, which, can, be, inspired, in, the, audience, by, bhavas, the, imitations, of, emotions, that, the, actors, perform, each, rasa, was, associated, with, a, specific, bhavas, portrayed, on, stage, the, terms, comedy, and, satire, became, synonymous, after, aristotle, s, poetics, was, translated, into, arabic, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, where, it, was, elaborated, upon, by, arabic, writers, and, islamic, philosophers, such, as, abu, bischr, his, pupil, al, farabi, persian, avicenna, and, averroes, due, to, cultural, differences, they, disassociated, comedy, from, greek, dramatic, representation, and, instead, identified, it, with, arabic, poetic, themes, and, forms, such, as, hija, satirical, poetry, they, viewed, comedy, as, simply, the, art, of, reprehension, and, made, no, reference, to, light, and, cheerful, events, or, troublesome, beginnings, and, happy, endings, associated, with, classical, greek, comedy, after, the, latin, translations, of, the, 12th, century, the, term, comedy, thus, gained, a, new, meaning, in, medieval, literature, mento, star, lord, flea, stated, in, a, 1957, interview, that, he, thought, that, west, indians, have, the, best, sense, of, humour, in, the, world, even, in, the, most, solemn, song, like, las, kean, fine, which, tells, of, a, boiler, explosion, on, a, sugar, plantation, that, killed, several, of, the, workers, their, natural, wit, and, humour, shine, though, confucianist, neo, confucian, orthodoxy, with, its, emphasis, on, ritual, and, propriety, have, traditionally, looked, down, upon, humour, as, subversive, or, unseemly, humour, was, perceived, as, irony, and, sarcasm, the, confucian, analects, itself, however, depicts, the, master, as, fond, of, humorous, self, deprecation, once, comparing, his, wanderings, to, the, existence, of, a, homeless, dog, early, daoist, philosophical, texts, such, as, zhuangzi, pointedly, make, fun, of, confucian, seriousness, and, make, confucius, himself, a, slow, witted, figure, of, fun, joke, books, containing, a, mix, of, wordplay, puns, situational, humour, and, play, with, taboo, subjects, like, sex, and, scatology, remained, popular, over, the, centuries, local, performing, arts, storytelling, vernacular, fiction, and, poetry, offer, a, wide, variety, of, humorous, styles, and, sensibilities, famous, chinese, humourists, include, the, ancient, jesters, chunyu, kun, and, dongfang, shuo, writers, of, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, such, as, feng, menglong, li, yu, and, wu, jingzi, and, modern, comic, writers, such, as, lu, xun, lin, yutang, lao, she, qian, zhongshu, wang, xiaobo, and, wang, shuo, and, performers, such, as, ge, you, guo, degang, and, zhou, libo, modern, chinese, humour, has, been, heavily, influenced, not, only, by, indigenous, traditions, but, also, by, foreign, humor, circulated, via, print, culture, cinema, television, and, the, internet, during, the, 1930s, lin, yutang, s, phono, semantic, transliteration, y, um, humour, caught, on, as, a, new, term, for, humour, sparking, a, fad, for, humour, literature, as, well, as, impassioned, debate, about, what, type, of, humorous, sensibility, best, suited, china, a, poor, weak, country, under, partial, foreign, occupation, while, some, types, of, comedy, were, officially, sanctioned, during, the, rule, of, mao, zedong, the, party, state, s, approach, towards, humour, was, generally, repressive, social, liberalisation, in, the, 1980s, commercialisation, of, the, cultural, market, in, the, 1990s, and, the, advent, of, the, internet, have, each, despite, an, invasive, state, sponsored, censorship, apparatus, enabled, new, forms, of, humour, to, flourish, in, china, in, recent, decades, the, social, transformation, model, of, humour, predicts, that, specific, characteristics, such, as, physical, attractiveness, interact, with, humour, this, model, involves, linkages, between, the, humorist, an, audience, and, the, subject, matter, of, the, humour, the, two, transformations, associated, with, this, particular, model, involves, the, subject, matter, of, the, humour, and, the, change, in, the, audience, s, perception, of, the, humorous, person, therefore, establishing, a, relationship, between, the, humorous, speaker, and, the, audience, the, social, transformation, model, views, humour, as, adaptive, because, it, communicates, the, present, desire, to, be, humorous, as, well, as, future, intentions, of, being, humorous, this, model, is, used, with, deliberate, self, deprecating, humour, where, one, is, communicating, with, desires, to, be, accepted, into, someone, else, s, specific, social, group, although, self, deprecating, humour, communicates, weakness, and, fallibility, in, the, bid, to, gain, another, s, affection, it, can, be, concluded, from, the, model, that, this, type, of, humour, can, increase, romantic, attraction, towards, the, humorist, when, other, variables, are, also, favourable, 90, of, men, and, 81, of, women, all, college, students, report, having, a, sense, of, humour, is, a, crucial, characteristic, looked, for, in, a, romantic, partner, humour, and, honesty, were, ranked, as, the, two, most, important, attributes, in, a, significant, other, it, has, since, been, recorded, that, humour, becomes, more, evident, and, significantly, more, important, as, the, level, of, commitment, in, a, romantic, relationship, increases, recent, research, suggests, expressions, of, humour, in, relation, to, physical, attractiveness, are, two, major, factors, in, the, desire, for, future, interaction, women, regard, physical, attractiveness, less, highly, compared, to, men, when, it, came, to, dating, a, serious, relationship, and, sexual, intercourse, however, women, rate, humorous, men, more, desirable, than, nonhumorous, individuals, for, a, serious, relationship, or, marriage, but, only, when, these, men, were, physically, attractive, furthermore, humorous, people, are, perceived, by, others, to, be, more, cheerful, but, less, intellectual, than, nonhumorous, people, self, deprecating, humour, has, been, found, to, increase, one, s, desirability, and, physical, attractiveness, to, others, for, committed, relationships, the, results, of, a, study, conducted, by, mcmaster, university, suggest, humour, can, positively, affect, one, s, desirability, for, a, specific, relationship, partner, but, this, effect, is, only, most, likely, to, occur, when, men, use, humour, and, are, evaluated, by, women, no, evidence, was, found, to, suggest, men, prefer, women, with, a, sense, of, humour, as, partners, nor, women, preferring, other, women, with, a, sense, of, humour, as, potential, partners, when, women, were, given, the, forced, choice, design, in, the, study, they, chose, funny, men, as, potential, relationship, partners, even, though, they, rated, them, as, being, less, honest, and, intelligent, post, hoc, analysis, showed, no, relationship, between, humour, quality, and, favourable, judgments, it, is, generally, known, that, humour, contributes, to, higher, subjective, wellbeing, both, physical, and, psychological, previous, research, on, humour, and, psychological, well, being, show, that, humour, is, in, fact, a, major, factor, in, achieving, and, sustaining, higher, psychological, wellbeing, this, hypothesis, is, known, as, general, facilitative, hypothesis, for, humour, that, is, positive, humour, leads, to, positive, health, not, all, contemporary, research, however, supports, the, previous, assertion, that, humour, is, in, fact, a, cause, for, healthier, psychological, wellbeing, some, of, the, previous, researches, limitations, is, that, they, tend, to, use, a, unidimensional, approach, to, humour, because, it, was, always, inferred, that, humour, was, deemed, positive, they, did, not, consider, other, types, of, humour, or, humour, styles, for, example, self, defeating, or, aggressive, humour, research, has, proposed, 2, types, of, humour, that, each, consist, of, 2, styles, making, 4, styles, in, total, the, two, types, are, adaptive, versus, maladaptive, humour, adaptive, humour, consist, of, facilitative, and, self, enhancing, humour, and, maladaptive, is, self, defeating, and, aggressive, humour, each, of, these, styles, can, have, a, different, impact, on, psychological, and, individuals, overall, subjective, wellbeing, in, the, study, on, humour, and, psychological, well, being, research, has, concluded, that, high, levels, of, adaptive, type, humour, affiliative, and, self, enhancing, is, associated, with, better, self, esteem, positive, affect, greater, self, competency, as, well, as, anxiety, control, and, social, interactions, all, of, which, are, constituents, of, psychological, wellbeing, additionally, adaptive, humour, styles, may, enable, people, to, preserve, their, sense, of, wellbeing, despite, psychological, problems, in, contrast, maladaptive, humour, types, aggressive, and, self, defeating, are, associated, with, poorer, overall, psychological, wellbeing, emphasis, on, higher, levels, of, anxiety, and, depression, therefore, humour, may, have, detrimental, effects, on, psychological, wellbeing, only, if, that, humour, is, of, negative, characteristics, humour, is, often, used, to, make, light, of, difficult, or, stressful, situations, and, to, brighten, up, a, social, atmosphere, in, general, it, is, regarded, by, many, as, an, enjoyable, and, positive, experience, so, it, would, be, reasonable, to, assume, that, it, might, have, some, positive, physiological, effects, on, the, body, a, study, designed, to, test, the, positive, physiological, effects, of, humour, the, relationship, between, being, exposed, to, humour, and, pain, tolerance, in, particular, was, conducted, in, 1994, by, karen, zwyer, barbara, velker, and, willibald, ruch, to, test, the, effects, of, humour, on, pain, tolerance, the, test, subjects, were, first, exposed, to, a, short, humorous, video, clip, and, then, exposed, to, the, cold, pressor, test, to, identify, the, aspects, of, humour, which, might, contribute, to, an, increase, in, pain, tolerance, the, study, separated, its, fifty, six, female, participants, into, three, groups, cheerfulness, exhilaration, and, humour, production, the, subjects, were, further, separated, into, two, groups, high, trait, cheerfulness, and, high, trait, seriousness, according, to, the, state, trait, cheerfulness, inventory, the, instructions, for, the, three, groups, were, as, follows, the, cheerfulness, group, were, told, to, get, excited, about, the, movie, without, laughing, or, smiling, the, exhilaration, group, was, told, to, laugh, and, smile, excessively, exaggerating, their, natural, reactions, the, humour, production, group, was, told, to, make, humorous, comments, about, the, video, clip, as, they, watched, to, ensure, that, the, participants, actually, found, the, movie, humorous, and, that, it, produced, the, desired, effects, the, participants, took, a, survey, on, the, topic, which, resulted, in, a, mean, score, of, 3, 64, out, of, 5, the, results, of, the, cold, press, test, showed, that, the, participants, in, all, three, groups, experienced, a, higher, pain, threshold, and, a, higher, pain, tolerance, than, previous, to, the, film, the, results, did, not, show, a, significant, difference, between, the, three, groups, there, are, also, potential, relationships, between, humour, and, having, a, healthy, immune, system, siga, is, a, type, of, antibody, that, protects, the, body, from, infections, in, a, method, similar, to, the, previous, experiment, the, participants, were, shown, a, short, humorous, video, clip, and, then, tested, for, the, effects, the, participants, showed, a, significant, increase, in, siga, levels, there, have, been, claims, that, laughter, can, be, a, supplement, for, cardiovascular, exercise, and, might, increase, muscle, tone, however, an, early, study, by, paskind, j, showed, that, laughter, can, lead, to, a, decrease, in, skeletal, muscle, tone, because, the, short, intense, muscle, contractions, caused, by, laughter, are, followed, by, longer, periods, of, muscle, relaxation, the, cardiovascular, benefits, of, laughter, also, seem, to, be, just, a, figment, of, imagination, as, a, study, that, was, designed, to, test, oxygen, saturation, levels, produced, by, laughter, showed, that, even, though, laughter, creates, sporadic, episodes, of, deep, breathing, oxygen, saturation, levels, are, not, affected, as, humour, is, often, used, to, ease, tension, it, might, make, sense, that, the, same, would, be, true, for, anxiety, a, study, by, yovetich, n, dale, a, hudak, m, was, designed, to, test, the, effects, humour, might, have, on, relieving, anxiety, the, study, subject, were, told, that, they, would, be, given, to, an, electric, shock, after, a, certain, period, of, time, one, group, was, exposed, to, humorous, content, while, the, other, was, not, the, anxiety, levels, were, measured, through, self, report, measures, as, well, as, the, heart, rate, subjects, which, rated, high, on, sense, of, humour, reported, less, anxiety, in, both, groups, while, subjects, which, rated, lower, on, sense, of, humour, reported, less, anxiety, in, the, group, which, was, exposed, to, the, humorous, material, however, there, was, not, a, significant, difference, in, the, heart, rate, between, the, subjects, humour, is, a, ubiquitous, highly, ingrained, and, largely, meaningful, aspect, of, human, experience, and, is, therefore, decidedly, relevant, in, organisational, contexts, such, as, the, workplace, the, significant, role, that, laughter, and, fun, play, in, organisational, life, has, been, seen, as, a, sociological, phenomenon, and, has, increasingly, been, recognised, as, also, creating, a, sense, of, involvement, and, possible, comradery, among, workers, sharing, humour, at, work, not, only, offers, a, relief, from, boredom, but, can, also, build, relationships, improve, camaraderie, between, colleagues, and, create, positive, affect, humour, in, the, workplace, may, also, relieve, tension, and, can, be, used, as, a, coping, strategy, in, fact, one, of, the, most, agreed, upon, key, impacts, that, workplace, humour, has, on, people, s, well, being, is, the, use, of, humour, as, a, coping, strategy, to, aid, in, dealing, with, daily, stresses, adversity, or, other, difficult, situations, sharing, a, laugh, with, a, few, colleagues, may, improve, moods, which, is, pleasurable, and, people, perceive, this, as, positively, affecting, their, ability, to, cope, fun, and, enjoyment, are, critical, in, people, s, lives, and, the, ability, for, colleagues, to, be, able, to, laugh, during, work, through, banter, or, other, promotes, harmony, and, a, sense, of, cohesiveness, humour, may, also, be, used, to, offset, negative, feelings, about, a, workplace, task, or, to, mitigate, the, use, of, profanity, or, other, coping, strategies, that, may, not, be, otherwise, tolerated, not, only, can, humour, in, the, workplace, assist, with, defusing, negative, emotions, but, it, may, also, be, used, as, an, outlet, to, discuss, personal, painful, events, in, a, lighter, context, thus, ultimately, reducing, anxiety, and, allowing, more, happy, positive, emotions, to, surface, additionally, humour, may, be, used, as, a, tool, to, mitigate, the, authoritative, tone, by, managers, when, giving, directives, to, subordinates, managers, may, use, self, deprecating, humour, as, a, way, to, be, perceived, as, more, human, and, real, by, their, employees, the, attachment, to, the, notion, of, fun, by, contemporary, companies, has, resulted, in, workplace, management, coming, to, recognise, the, potentially, positive, effects, of, workplay, and, realise, that, it, does, not, necessarily, undermine, workers, performance, laughter, and, play, can, unleash, creativity, thus, raising, morale, so, in, the, interest, of, encouraging, employee, consent, to, the, rigours, of, the, labour, process, management, often, ignore, tolerate, and, even, actively, encourage, playful, practices, with, the, purpose, of, furthering, organisational, goals, essentially, fun, in, the, workplace, is, no, longer, being, seen, as, frivolous, the, most, current, approach, of, managed, fun, and, laughter, in, the, workplace, originated, in, north, america, where, it, has, taken, off, to, such, a, degree, that, it, has, humour, consultants, flourishing, as, some, states, have, introduced, an, official, fun, at, work, day, the, results, have, carried, claims, of, well, being, benefits, to, workers, improved, customer, experiences, and, an, increase, in, productivity, that, organisations, can, enjoy, as, a, result, others, examined, results, of, this, movement, while, focusing, around, the, science, of, happiness, concerned, with, mental, health, motivation, community, building, and, national, well, being, and, drew, attention, to, the, ability, to, achieve, flow, through, playfulness, and, stimulate, outside, the, box, thinking, parallel, to, this, movement, is, the, positive, scholarship, that, has, emerged, in, psychology, which, seeks, to, empirically, theorise, the, optimisation, of, human, potential, this, happiness, movement, suggests, that, investing, in, fun, at, the, workplace, by, allowing, for, laughter, and, play, will, not, only, create, enjoyment, and, a, greater, sense, of, well, being, but, it, will, also, enhance, energy, performance, and, commitment, in, workers, the, use, of, humour, plays, an, important, role, in, youth, development, studies, have, shown, that, humour, is, especially, important, in, social, interactions, with, peers, school, entry, is, the, time, when, the, importance, of, parents, fades, into, the, background, and, social, interaction, with, peers, becomes, increasingly, important, conflict, is, inherent, in, these, interactions, the, use, of, humour, plays, an, important, role, in, conflict, resolution, and, ultimately, in, school, success, and, psychological, adjustment, the, use, of, humour, that, is, socially, acceptable, leads, to, a, lower, likelihood, of, being, a, victim, of, bullying, whereas, the, use, of, self, disparaging, humour, leads, to, a, higher, likelihood, of, being, bullied, when, students, are, bullied, the, use, of, self, disparaging, humour, can, lead, to, an, exacerbation, of, the, negative, effects, on, the, student, s, psychological, adjustment, to, school, one, of, the, main, focuses, of, modern, psychological, humour, theory, and, research, is, to, establish, and, clarify, the, correlation, between, humour, and, laughter, the, major, empirical, findings, here, are, that, laughter, and, humour, do, not, always, have, a, one, to, one, association, while, most, previous, theories, assumed, the, connection, between, the, two, almost, to, the, point, of, them, being, synonymous, psychology, has, been, able, to, scientifically, and, empirically, investigate, the, supposed, connection, its, implications, and, significance, in, 2009, diana, szameitat, conducted, a, study, to, examine, the, differentiation, of, emotions, in, laughter, they, hired, actors, and, told, them, to, laugh, with, one, of, four, different, emotional, associations, by, using, auto, induction, where, they, would, focus, exclusively, on, the, internal, emotion, and, not, on, the, expression, of, laughter, itself, they, found, an, overall, recognition, rate, of, 44, with, joy, correctly, classified, at, 44, tickle, 45, schadenfreude, 37, and, taunt, 50, 399, their, second, experiment, tested, the, behavioural, recognition, of, laughter, during, an, induced, emotional, state, and, they, found, that, different, laughter, types, did, differ, with, respect, to, emotional, dimensions, 401, 402, in, addition, the, four, emotional, states, displayed, a, full, range, of, high, and, low, sender, arousal, and, valence, 403, this, study, showed, that, laughter, can, be, correlated, with, both, positive, joy, and, tickle, and, negative, schadenfreude, and, taunt, emotions, with, varying, degrees, of, arousal, in, the, subject, this, brings, into, question, the, definition, of, humour, then, if, it, is, to, be, defined, by, the, cognitive, processes, which, display, laughter, then, humour, itself, can, encompass, a, variety, of, negative, as, well, as, positive, emotions, however, if, humour, is, limited, to, positive, emotions, and, things, which, cause, positive, affect, it, must, be, delimited, from, laughter, and, their, relationship, should, be, further, defined, adaptive, humour, use, has, shown, to, be, effective, for, increasing, resilience, in, dealing, with, distress, and, also, effective, in, buffering, against, or, undoing, negative, affects, in, contrast, maladaptive, humour, use, can, magnify, potential, negative, effects, madelijn, strick, rob, holland, rick, van, baaren, and, ad, van, knippenberg, 2009, of, radboud, university, conducted, a, study, that, showed, the, distracting, nature, of, a, joke, on, bereaved, individuals, 574, 578, subjects, were, presented, with, a, wide, range, of, negative, pictures, and, sentences, their, findings, showed, that, humorous, therapy, attenuated, the, negative, emotions, elicited, after, negative, pictures, and, sentences, were, presented, in, addition, the, humour, therapy, was, more, effective, in, reducing, negative, affect, as, the, degree, of, affect, increased, in, intensity, 575, 576, humour, was, immediately, effective, in, helping, to, deal, with, distress, the, escapist, nature, of, humour, as, a, coping, mechanism, suggests, that, it, is, most, useful, in, dealing, with, momentary, stresses, stronger, negative, stimuli, requires, a, different, therapeutic, approach, humour, is, an, underlying, character, trait, associated, with, the, positive, emotions, used, in, the, broaden, and, build, theory, of, cognitive, development, studies, such, as, those, testing, the, undoing, hypothesis, 313, have, shown, several, positive, outcomes, of, humour, as, an, underlying, positive, trait, in, amusement, and, playfulness, several, studies, have, shown, that, positive, emotions, can, restore, autonomic, quiescence, after, negative, affect, for, example, frederickson, and, levinson, showed, that, individuals, who, expressed, duchenne, smiles, during, the, negative, arousal, of, a, sad, and, troubling, event, recovered, from, the, negative, affect,

to, improve, and, help, the, ageing, process, in, three, areas, the, areas, are, improving, physical, health, improving, social, communications, and, helping, to, achieve, a, sense, of, satisfaction, in, life, studies, have, shown, that, constant, humour, in, the, ageing, process, gives, health, benefits, to, individuals, such, benefits, as, higher, self, esteem, lower, levels, of, depression, anxiety, and, perceived, stress, and, a, more, positive, self, concept, as, well, as, other, health, benefits, which, have, been, recorded, and, acknowledged, through, various, studies, even, patients, with, specific, diseases, have, shown, improvement, with, ageing, using, humour, overall, there, is, a, strong, correlation, through, constant, humour, in, ageing, and, better, health, in, the, individuals, another, way, that, research, indicates, that, humour, helps, with, the, ageing, process, is, through, helping, the, individual, to, create, and, maintain, strong, social, relationship, during, transitory, periods, in, their, lives, one, such, example, is, when, people, are, moved, into, nursing, homes, or, other, facilities, of, care, with, this, transition, certain, social, interactions, with, friend, and, family, may, be, limited, forcing, the, individual, to, look, elsewhere, for, these, social, interactions, humour, has, been, shown, to, make, transitions, easier, as, humour, is, shown, reduce, stress, and, facilitate, socialisation, and, serves, as, a, social, bonding, function, humour, may, also, help, the, transition, in, helping, the, individual, to, maintain, positive, feelings, towards, those, who, are, enforcing, the, changes, in, their, lives, these, new, social, interactions, can, be, critical, for, these, transitions, in, their, lives,

their, lives, through, the, ageing, process, many, changes, will, occur, such, as, losing, the, right, to, drive, a, car, this, can, cause, a, decrease, in, satisfaction, in, the, lives, of, the, individual, humour, helps, to, alleviate, this, decrease, of, satisfaction, by, allowing, the, humour, to, release, stress, and, anxiety, caused, by, changes, in, the, individuals, life, laughing, and, humour, can, be, a, substitute, for, the, decrease, in, satisfaction, by, allowing, individuals, to, feel, better, about, their, situations, by, alleviating, the, stress, this, in, turn, can, help, them, to, maintain, a, sense, of, satisfaction, towards, their, new, and, changing, life, style, in, an, article, published, in, nature, reviews, neuroscience, it, is, reported, that, a, study, s, results, indicate, that, humour, is, rooted, in, the, frontal, lobe, of, the, cerebral, cortex, the, study, states, in, part, humour, seems, to, engage, a, core, network, of, cortical, and, subcortical, structures, including, temporo, occipito, parietal, areas, involved, in, detecting, and, resolving, incongruity, mismatch, between, expected, and, presented, stimuli, and, the,
