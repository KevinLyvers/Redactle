social, theories, are, analytical, frameworks, or, paradigms, that, are, used, to, study, and, interpret, social, phenomena, a, tool, used, by, social, scientists, social, theories, relate, to, historical, debates, over, the, validity, and, reliability, of, different, methodologies, e, g, positivism, and, antipositivism, the, primacy, of, either, structure, or, agency, as, well, as, the, relationship, between, contingency, and, necessity, social, theory, in, an, informal, nature, or, authorship, based, outside, of, academic, social, and, political, science, may, be, referred, to, as, social, criticism, or, social, commentary, or, cultural, criticism, and, may, be, associated, both, with, formal, cultural, and, literary, scholarship, as, well, as, other, non, academic, or, journalistic, forms, of, writing, social, theory, by, definition, is, used, to, make, distinctions, and, generalizations, among, different, types, of, societies, and, to, analyze, modernity, as, it, has, emerged, in, the, past, few, centuries, 10, social, theory, as, it, is, recognized, today, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, as, a, distinct, discipline, and, was, largely, equated, with, an, attitude, of, critical, thinking, and, the, desire, for, knowledge, through, a, posteriori, methods, of, discovery, rather, than, a, priori, methods, of, tradition, social, thought, provides, general, theories, to, explain, actions, and, behavior, of, society, as, a, whole, encompassing, sociological, political, and, philosophical, ideas, classical, social, theory, has, generally, been, presented, from, a, perspective, of, western, philosophy, and, often, regarded, as, eurocentric, theory, construction, according, to, the, blackwell, encyclopedia, of, sociology, is, instrumental, their, goal, is, to, promote, accurate, communication, rigorous, testing, high, accuracy, and, broad, applicability, they, include, the, following, absence, of, contradictions, absence, of, ambivalence, abstractness, generality, precision, parsimony, and, conditionality, therefore, a, social, theory, consists, of, well, defined, terms, statements, arguments, and, scope, conditions, confucius, 551, 479, bce, envisaged, a, just, society, that, went, beyond, his, contemporary, society, of, the, warring, states, later, on, also, in, china, mozi, circa, 470, circa, 390, bce, recommended, a, more, pragmatic, sociology, but, ethical, at, base, in, the, west, saint, augustine, 354, 430, was, concerned, exclusively, with, the, idea, of, the, just, society, st, augustine, describes, late, ancient, roman, society, through, a, lens, of, hatred, and, contempt, for, what, he, saw, as, false, gods, and, in, reaction, theorized, city, of, god, ancient, greek, philosophers, including, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, and, plato, 428, 427, or, 424, 423, 348, 347, bc, did, not, see, a, distinction, between, politics, and, society, the, concept, of, society, did, not, come, until, the, enlightenment, period, the, term, soci, t, was, probably, first, used, as, key, concept, by, rousseau, in, discussion, of, social, relations, prior, to, the, enlightenment, social, theory, took, largely, narrative, and, normative, form, it, was, expressed, as, stories, and, fables, and, it, may, be, assumed, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, and, religious, teachers, were, the, precursors, to, social, theory, proper, there, is, evidence, of, early, muslim, sociology, from, the, 14th, century, in, ibn, khaldun, s, muqaddimah, later, translated, as, prolegomena, in, latin, the, introduction, to, a, seven, volume, analysis, of, universal, history, was, the, first, to, advance, social, philosophy, and, social, science, in, formulating, theories, of, social, cohesion, and, social, conflict, ibn, khaldun, is, thus, considered, by, many, to, be, the, forerunner, of, sociology, khaldun, s, treatise, described, in, muqaddimah, introduction, to, history, published, in, 1377, two, types, of, societies, 1, the, city, or, town, dweller, and, 2, the, mobile, nomadic, societies, modernity, arose, during, the, enlightenment, period, with, the, emergence, of, the, world, economy, and, exchange, among, diverse, societies, bringing, sweeping, changes, and, new, challenges, for, society, many, french, and, scottish, intellectuals, and, philosophers, embraced, the, idea, of, progress, and, ideas, of, modernity, the, enlightenment, period, was, marked, by, the, idea, that, with, new, discoveries, challenging, the, traditional, way, of, thinking, scientists, were, required, to, find, new, normativity, this, process, allowed, scientific, knowledge, and, society, to, progress, french, thought, during, this, period, focused, on, moral, critique, and, criticisms, of, the, monarchy, 15, these, ideas, did, not, draw, on, ideas, of, the, past, from, classical, thinkers, nor, involved, following, religious, teachings, and, authority, of, the, monarch, a, common, factor, among, the, classical, theories, was, the, agreement, that, the, history, of, humanity, is, pursuing, a, fixed, path, they, differed, on, where, that, path, would, lead, social, progress, technological, progress, decline, or, even, fall, social, cycle, theorists, were, skeptical, of, the, western, achievements, and, technological, progress, but, argued, that, progress, is, an, illusion, of, the, ups, and, downs, of, the, historical, cycles, the, classical, approach, has, been, criticized, by, many, modern, sociologists, and, theorists, among, them, karl, popper, robert, nisbet, charles, tilly, and, immanuel, wallerstein, the, 19th, century, brought, questions, involving, social, order, the, french, revolution, freed, french, society, of, control, by, the, monarchy, with, no, effective, means, of, maintaining, social, order, until, napoleon, came, to, power, three, great, classical, theories, of, social, and, historical, change, emerged, the, social, evolutionism, theory, of, which, social, darwinism, forms, a, part, the, social, cycle, theory, and, the, marxist, historical, materialism, theory, 19th, century, classical, social, theory, has, been, expanded, upon, to, create, newer, contemporary, social, theories, such, as, multilineal, theories, of, evolution, neoevolutionism, sociobiology, theory, of, modernization, theory, of, post, industrial, society, and, various, strains, of, neo, marxism, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, social, theory, became, closely, related, to, academic, sociology, and, other, related, studies, such, as, anthropology, philosophy, and, social, work, branched, out, into, their, own, disciplines, subjects, like, philosophy, of, history, and, other, multi, disciplinary, subject, matter, became, part, of, social, theory, as, taught, under, sociology, a, revival, of, discussion, free, of, disciplines, began, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, the, frankfurt, institute, for, social, research, is, a, historical, example, the, committee, on, social, thought, at, the, university, of, chicago, followed, in, the, 1940s, in, the, 1970s, programs, in, social, and, political, thought, were, established, at, sussex, and, york, others, followed, with, emphases, and, structures, such, as, social, theory, and, history, university, of, california, davis, cultural, studies, programs, extended, the, concerns, of, social, theory, into, the, domain, of, culture, and, thus, anthropology, a, chair, and, undergraduate, program, in, social, theory, was, established, at, the, university, of, melbourne, social, theory, at, present, seems, to, be, gaining, acceptance, as, a, classical, academic, discipline, adam, ferguson, montesquieu, and, john, millar, among, others, were, the, first, to, study, society, as, distinct, from, political, institutions, and, processes, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, scientific, method, was, introduced, into, study, of, society, which, was, a, significant, advance, leading, to, development, of, sociology, as, a, discipline, in, the, 18th, century, the, pre, classical, period, of, social, theories, developed, a, new, form, that, provides, the, basic, ideas, for, social, theory, such, as, evolution, philosophy, of, history, social, life, and, social, contract, public, and, general, will, competition, in, social, space, organismic, pattern, for, social, description, montesquieu, in, the, spirit, of, laws, which, established, that, social, elements, influence, human, nature, was, possibly, the, first, to, suggest, a, universal, explanation, for, history, montesquieu, included, changes, in, mores, and, manners, as, part, of, his, explanation, of, political, and, historic, events, 23, philosophers, including, jean, jacques, rousseau, voltaire, and, denis, diderot, developed, new, social, ideas, during, the, enlightenment, period, that, were, based, on, reason, and, methods, of, scientific, inquiry, jean, jacques, rousseau, in, this, time, played, a, significant, role, in, social, theory, he, revealed, the, origin, of, inequality, analyzed, the, social, contract, and, social, compact, that, forms, social, integration, and, defined, the, social, sphere, or, civil, society, jean, jacques, rousseau, also, emphasized, that, man, has, the, liberty, to, change, his, world, an, assertion, that, made, it, possible, to, program, and, change, society, adam, smith, addressed, the, question, of, whether, vast, inequalities, of, wealth, represented, progress, he, explained, that, the, wealthy, often, demand, convenience, employing, numerous, others, to, carry, out, labor, to, meet, their, demands, smith, argued, that, this, allows, wealth, to, be, redistributed, among, inhabitants, and, for, all, to, share, in, progress, of, society, smith, explained, that, social, forces, could, regulate, the, market, economy, with, social, objectivity, and, without, need, for, government, intervention, smith, regarded, the, division, of, labor, as, an, important, factor, for, economic, progress, john, millar, suggested, that, improved, status, of, women, was, important, for, progress, of, society, millar, also, advocated, for, abolition, of, slavery, suggesting, that, personal, liberty, makes, people, more, industrious, ambitious, and, productive, the, first, modern, social, theories, known, as, classical, theories, that, begin, to, resemble, the, analytic, social, theory, of, today, developed, simultaneously, with, the, birth, of, the, science, of, sociology, auguste, comte, 1798, 1857, known, as, the, father, of, sociology, and, regarded, by, some, as, the, first, philosopher, of, science, laid, the, groundwork, for, positivism, as, well, as, structural, functionalism, and, social, evolutionism, karl, marx, rejected, comtean, positivism, but, nevertheless, aimed, to, establish, a, science, of, society, based, on, historical, materialism, becoming, recognised, as, a, founding, figure, of, sociology, posthumously, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, of, german, sociologists, including, max, weber, and, georg, simmel, developed, sociological, antipositivism, the, field, may, be, broadly, recognized, as, an, amalgam, of, three, modes, of, social, scientific, thought, in, particular, durkheimian, sociological, positivism, and, structural, functionalism, marxist, historical, materialism, and, conflict, theory, and, weberian, antipositivism, and, verstehen, critique, another, early, modern, theorist, herbert, spencer, 1820, 1903, coined, the, term, survival, of, the, fittest, vilfredo, pareto, 1848, 1923, and, pitirim, a, sorokin, argued, that, history, goes, in, cycles, and, presented, the, social, cycle, theory, to, illustrate, their, point, ferdinand, t, nnies, 1855, 1936, made, community, and, society, gemeinschaft, and, gesellschaft, 1887, the, special, topics, of, the, new, science, of, sociology, both, of, them, based, on, different, modes, of, will, of, social, actors, the, 19th, century, pioneers, of, social, theory, and, sociology, like, saint, simon, comte, marx, john, stuart, mill, or, spencer, never, held, university, posts, and, they, were, broadly, regarded, as, philosophers, emile, durkheim, endeavoured, to, formally, established, academic, sociology, and, did, so, at, the, university, of, bordeaux, in, 1895, he, published, rules, of, the, sociological, method, in, 1896, he, established, the, journal, l, ann, e, sociologique, durkheim, s, seminal, monograph, suicide, 1897, a, case, study, of, suicide, rates, amongst, catholic, and, protestant, populations, distinguished, sociological, analysis, from, psychology, or, philosophy, the, term, postmodernism, was, brought, into, social, theory, in, 1971, by, the, arab, american, theorist, ihab, hassan, in, his, book, the, dismemberment, of, orpheus, toward, a, postmodern, literature, in, 1979, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, wrote, a, short, but, influential, work, the, postmodern, condition, a, report, on, knowledge, jean, baudrillard, michel, foucault, and, roland, barthes, were, influential, in, the, 1970s, in, developing, postmodern, theory, scholars, most, commonly, hold, postmodernism, to, be, a, movement, of, ideas, arising, from, but, also, critical, of, elements, of, modernism, the, wide, range, of, uses, of, this, term, resulted, in, different, elements, of, modernity, are, chosen, as, being, continuous, each, of, the, different, uses, is, rooted, in, some, argument, about, the, nature, of, knowledge, known, in, philosophy, as, epistemology, individuals, who, use, the, term, are, arguing, that, either, there, is, something, fundamentally, different, about, the, transmission, of, meaning, or, that, modernism, has, fundamental, flaws, in, its, system, of, knowledge, the, argument, for, the, necessity, of, the, term, states, that, economic, and, technological, conditions, of, our, age, have, given, rise, to, a, decentralized, media, dominated, society, these, ideas, are, simulacra, and, only, inter, referential, representations, and, copies, of, each, other, with, no, real, original, stable, or, objective, source, for, communication, and, meaning, globalization, brought, on, by, innovations, in, communication, manufacturing, and, transportation, is, cited, as, one, force, which, has, decentralized, modern, life, creating, a, culturally, pluralistic, and, interconnected, global, society, lacking, any, single, dominant, center, of, political, power, communication, or, intellectual, production, the, postmodern, view, is, that, inter, subjective, knowledge, and, not, objective, knowledge, is, the, dominant, form, of, discourse, the, ubiquity, of, copies, and, dissemination, alters, the, relationship, between, reader, and, what, is, read, between, observer, and, the, observed, between, those, who, consume, and, those, who, produce, not, all, people, who, use, the, term, postmodern, or, postmodernism, see, these, developments, as, positive, users, of, the, term, argue, that, their, ideals, have, arisen, as, the, result, of, particular, economic, and, social, conditions, including, late, capitalism, the, growth, of, broadcast, media, and, that, such, conditions, have, pushed, society, into, a, new, historical, period, in, the, past, few, decades, in, response, to, postmodern, critiques, social, theory, has, begun, to, stress, free, will, individual, choice, subjective, reasoning, and, the, importance, of, unpredictable, events, in, place, of, deterministic, necessity, rational, choice, theory, symbolic, interactionism, false, necessity, are, examples, of, more, recent, developments, a, view, among, contemporary, sociologists, is, that, there, are, no, great, unifying, laws, of, history, but, rather, smaller, more, specific, and, more, complex, laws, that, govern, society, philosopher, and, politician, roberto, mangabeira, unger, recently, attempted, to, revise, classical, social, theory, by, exploring, how, things, fit, together, rather, than, to, provide, an, all, encompassing, single, explanation, of, a, universal, reality, he, begins, by, recognizing, the, key, insight, of, classical, social, theory, of, society, as, an, artifact, and, then, by, discarding, the, law, like, characteristics, forcibly, attached, to, it, unger, argues, that, classical, social, theory, was, born, proclaiming, that, society, is, made, and, imagined, and, not, the, expression, of, an, underlying, natural, order, but, at, the, same, time, its, capacity, was, checked, by, the, equally, prevalent, ambition, to, create, law, like, explanations, of, history, and, social, development, the, human, sciences, that, developed, claimed, to, identify, a, small, number, of, possible, types, of, social, organization, that, coexisted, or, succeeded, one, another, through, inescapable, developmental, tendencies, or, deep, seated, economic, organization, or, psychological, constraints, marxism, is, the, star, example, 1, unger, calling, his, efforts, super, theory, has, thus, sought, to, develop, a, comprehensive, view, of, history, and, society, unger, does, so, without, subsuming, deep, structure, analysis, under, an, indivisible, and, repeatable, type, of, social, organization, or, with, recourse, to, law, like, constraints, and, tendencies, 165, his, articulation, of, such, a, theory, is, in, false, necessity, anti, necessitarian, social, theory, in, the, service, of, radical, democracy, where, he, uses, deep, logic, practice, to, theorize, human, social, activity, through, anti, necessitarian, analysis, unger, begins, by, formulating, the, theory, of, false, necessity, which, claims, that, social, worlds, are, the, artifact, of, human, endeavors, there, is, no, pre, set, institutional, arrangement, that, societies, must, adhere, to, and, there, is, no, necessary, historical, mold, of, development, that, they, will, follow, we, are, free, to, choose, and, to, create, the, forms, and, the, paths, that, our, societies, will, take, however, this, does, not, give, license, to, absolute, contingency, unger, finds, that, there, are, groups, of, institutional, arrangements, that, work, together, to, bring, about, certain, institutional, forms, liberal, democracy, for, example, these, forms, are, the, basis, of, a, social, structure, which, unger, calls, formative, context, in, order, to, explain, how, we, move, from, one, formative, context, to, another, without, the, conventional, social, theory, constraints, of, historical, necessity, e, g, feudalism, to, capitalism, and, to, do, so, while, remaining, true, to, the, key, insight, of, individual, human, empowerment, and, anti, necessitarian, social, thought, unger, recognized, that, there, are, an, infinite, number, of, ways, of, resisting, social, and, institutional, constraints, which, can, lead, to, an, infinite, number, of, outcomes, this, variety, of, forms, of, resistance, and, empowerment, make, change, possible, unger, calls, this, empowerment, negative, capability, however, unger, adds, that, these, outcomes, are, always, reliant, on, the, forms, from, which, they, spring, the, new, world, is, built, upon, the, existing, one, the, chicago, school, developed, in, the, 1920s, through, the, work, of, albion, woodbury, small, w, i, thomas, ernest, w, burgess, robert, e, park, ellsworth, faris, george, herbert, mead, and, other, sociologists, at, the, university, of, chicago, the, chicago, school, focused, on, patterns, and, arrangement, of, social, phenomenon, across, time, and, place, and, within, context, of, other, social, variables, critical, theorists, focus, on, reflective, assessment, and, critique, of, society, and, culture, in, order, to, reveal, and, challenge, power, structures, and, their, relations, and, influences, on, social, groups, karl, marx, wrote, and, theorized, about, the, importance, of, political, economy, on, society, and, focused, on, the, material, conditions, of, life, 4, his, theories, centered, around, capitalism, and, its, effect, on, class, struggle, between, the, proletariat, and, bourgeoisie, postmodernism, was, defined, by, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, as, incredulity, towards, metanarratives, and, contrasted, that, with, modern, which, he, described, as, any, science, that, legitimates, itself, with, reference, to, a, metadiscourse, making, an, explicit, appeal, to, some, grand, narrative, such, as, the, dialectics, of, spirit, the, hermeneutics, of, meaning, the, emancipation, of, the, rational, or, working, subject, or, the, creation, of, wealth, other, theories, include, some, known, french, social, thinkers, are, claude, henri, saint, simon, auguste, comte, mile, durkheim, and, michel, foucault, british, social, thought, with, thinkers, such, as, herbert, spencer, addressed, questions, and, ideas, relating, to, political, economy, and, social, evolution, the, political, ideals, of, john, ruskin, were, a, precursor, of, social, economy, unto, this, last, had, a, very, important, impact, on, gandhi, s, philosophy, important, german, philosophers, and, social, thinkers, included, immanuel, kant, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, karl, marx, max, weber, georg, simmel, theodor, w, adorno, max, horkheimer, herbert, marcuse, and, niklas, luhmann, important, chinese, philosophers, and, social, thinkers, included, shang, yang, lao, zi, confucius, mencius, wang, chong, wang, yangming, li, zhi, zhu, xi, gu, yanwu, gong, zizhen, wei, yuan, kang, youwei, lu, xun, mao, zedong, zhu, ming, important, italian, social, scientists, include, antonio, gramsci, gaetano, mosca, vilfredo, pareto, franco, ferrarotti, important, thai, social, theorists, include, jit, phumisak, kukrit, pramoj, and, prawase, wasi, social, theory, seeks, to, question, why, humans, inhabit, the, world, the, way, they, do, and, how, that, came, to, be, by, looking, at, power, relations, social, structures, and, social, norms, while, also, examining, how, humans, relate, to, each, other, and, the, society, they, find, themselves, in, how, this, has, changed, over, time, and, in, different, cultures, and, the, tools, used, to, measure, those, things, social, theory, looks, to, interdisciplinarity, combining, knowledge, from, multiple, academic, disciplines, in, order, to, enlighten, these, complex, issues, and, can, draw, on, ideas, from, fields, as, diverse, as, anthropology, and, media, studies, social, theory, guides, scientific, inquiry, by, promoting, scientists, to, think, about, which, topics, are, suitable, for, investigation, and, how, they, should, measure, them, selecting, or, creating, appropriate, theory, for, use, in, examining, an, issue, is, an, important, skill, for, any, researcher, important, distinctions, a, theoretical, orientation, or, paradigm, is, a, worldview, the, lens, through, which, one, organizes, experience, i, e, thinking, of, human, interaction, in, terms, of, power, or, exchange, a, theory, is, an, attempt, to, explain, and, predict, behavior, in, particular, contexts, a, theoretical, orientation, cannot, be, proven, or, disproven, a, theory, can, having, a, theoretical, orientation, that, sees, the, world, in, terms, of, power, and, control, one, could, create, a, theory, about, violent, human, behavior, which, includes, specific, causal, statements, e, g, being, the, victim, of, physical, abuse, leads, to, psychological, problems, this, could, lead, to, a, hypothesis, prediction, about, what, one, expects, to, see, in, a, particular, sample, e, g, a, battered, child, will, grow, up, to, be, shy, or, violent, one, can, then, test, the, hypothesis, by, looking, to, see, if, it, is, consistent, with, data, one, might, for, instance, review, hospital, records, to, find, children, who, were, abused, then, track, them, down, and, administer, a, personality, test, to, see, if, they, show, signs, of, being, violent, or, shy, the, selection, of, an, appropriate, i, e, useful, theoretical, orientation, within, which, to, develop, a, potentially, helpful, theory, is, the, bedrock, of, social, science, philosophical, questions, addressed, by, social, thinkers, often, centered, around, modernity, including, other, issues, relating, to, modernity, that, were, addressed, by, social, thinkers, include, social, atomization, alienation, loneliness, social, disorganization, and, secularization
