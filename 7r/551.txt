a, patent, is, a, type, of, intellectual, property, that, gives, its, owner, the, legal, right, to, exclude, others, from, making, using, or, selling, an, invention, for, a, limited, period, of, time, in, exchange, for, publishing, an, enabling, disclosure, of, the, invention, in, most, countries, patent, rights, fall, under, private, law, and, the, patent, holder, must, sue, someone, infringing, the, patent, in, order, to, enforce, their, rights, the, procedure, for, granting, patents, requirements, placed, on, the, patentee, and, the, extent, of, the, exclusive, rights, vary, widely, between, countries, according, to, national, laws, and, international, agreements, typically, however, a, patent, application, must, include, one, or, more, claims, that, define, the, scope, of, protection, that, is, being, sought, a, patent, may, include, many, claims, each, of, which, defines, a, specific, property, right, under, the, world, trade, organization, s, wto, trips, agreement, patents, should, be, available, in, wto, member, states, for, any, invention, in, all, fields, of, technology, provided, they, are, new, involve, an, inventive, step, and, are, capable, of, industrial, application, nevertheless, there, are, variations, on, what, is, patentable, subject, matter, from, country, to, country, also, among, wto, member, states, trips, also, provides, that, the, term, of, protection, available, should, be, a, minimum, of, twenty, years, some, countries, have, other, patent, like, forms, of, intellectual, property, such, as, utility, models, which, have, a, shorter, monopoly, period, the, word, patent, originates, from, the, latin, patere, which, means, to, lay, open, i, e, to, make, available, for, public, inspection, it, is, a, shortened, version, of, the, term, letters, patent, which, was, an, open, document, or, instrument, issued, by, a, monarch, or, government, granting, exclusive, rights, to, a, person, predating, the, modern, patent, system, similar, grants, included, land, patents, which, were, land, grants, by, early, state, governments, in, the, us, and, printing, patents, a, precursor, of, modern, copyright, in, modern, usage, the, term, patent, usually, refers, to, the, right, granted, to, anyone, who, invents, something, new, useful, and, non, obvious, a, patent, is, often, referred, to, as, a, form, of, intellectual, property, right, an, expression, which, is, also, used, to, refer, to, trademarks, and, copyrights, and, which, has, proponents, and, detractors, see, also, intellectual, property, the, term, intellectual, property, some, other, types, of, intellectual, property, rights, are, also, called, patents, in, some, jurisdictions, industrial, design, rights, are, called, design, patents, in, the, us, plant, breeders, rights, are, sometimes, called, plant, patents, and, utility, models, and, gebrauchsmuster, are, sometimes, called, petty, patents, or, innovation, patents, the, additional, qualification, utility, patent, is, sometimes, used, primarily, in, the, us, to, distinguish, the, primary, meaning, from, these, other, types, of, patents, particular, types, of, patents, for, inventions, include, biological, patents, business, method, patents, chemical, patents, and, software, patents, although, there, is, evidence, that, some, form, of, patent, rights, was, recognized, in, ancient, greece, in, the, city, of, sybaris, the, first, statutory, patent, system, is, generally, regarded, to, be, the, venetian, patent, statute, of, 1474, however, recent, historical, research, has, suggested, that, the, 1474, statute, was, inspired, by, laws, in, the, kingdom, of, jerusalem, that, granted, monopolies, to, developers, of, novel, silk, making, techniques, patents, were, systematically, granted, in, venice, as, of, 1474, where, they, issued, a, decree, by, which, new, and, inventive, devices, had, to, be, communicated, to, the, republic, in, order, to, obtain, legal, protection, against, potential, infringers, the, period, of, protection, was, 10, years, as, venetians, emigrated, they, sought, similar, patent, protection, in, their, new, homes, this, led, to, the, diffusion, of, patent, systems, to, other, countries, the, english, patent, system, evolved, from, its, early, medieval, origins, into, the, first, modern, patent, system, that, recognised, intellectual, property, in, order, to, stimulate, invention, this, was, the, crucial, legal, foundation, upon, which, the, industrial, revolution, could, emerge, and, flourish, by, the, 16th, century, the, english, crown, would, habitually, abuse, the, granting, of, letters, patent, for, monopolies, after, public, outcry, king, james, i, of, england, vi, of, scotland, was, forced, to, revoke, all, existing, monopolies, and, declare, that, they, were, only, to, be, used, for, projects, of, new, invention, this, was, incorporated, into, the, statute, of, monopolies, 1624, in, which, parliament, restricted, the, crown, s, power, explicitly, so, that, the, king, could, only, issue, letters, patent, to, the, inventors, or, introducers, of, original, inventions, for, a, fixed, number, of, years, the, statute, became, the, foundation, for, later, developments, in, patent, law, in, england, and, elsewhere, important, developments, in, patent, law, emerged, during, the, 18th, century, through, a, slow, process, of, judicial, interpretation, of, the, law, during, the, reign, of, queen, anne, patent, applications, were, required, to, supply, a, complete, specification, of, the, principles, of, operation, of, the, invention, for, public, access, legal, battles, around, the, 1796, patent, taken, out, by, james, watt, for, his, steam, engine, established, the, principles, that, patents, could, be, issued, for, improvements, of, an, already, existing, machine, and, that, ideas, or, principles, without, specific, practical, application, could, also, legally, be, patented, the, english, legal, system, became, the, foundation, for, patent, law, in, countries, with, a, common, law, heritage, including, the, united, states, new, zealand, and, australia, in, the, thirteen, colonies, inventors, could, obtain, patents, through, petition, to, a, given, colony, s, legislature, in, 1641, samuel, winslow, was, granted, the, first, patent, in, north, america, by, the, massachusetts, general, court, for, a, new, process, for, making, salt, the, modern, french, patent, system, was, created, during, the, revolution, in, 1791, patents, were, granted, without, examination, since, inventor, s, right, was, considered, as, a, natural, one, patent, costs, were, very, high, from, 500, to, 1, 500, francs, importation, patents, protected, new, devices, coming, from, foreign, countries, the, patent, law, was, revised, in, 1844, patent, cost, was, lowered, and, importation, patents, were, abolished, the, first, patent, act, of, the, u, s, congress, was, passed, on, april, 10, 1790, titled, an, act, to, promote, the, progress, of, useful, arts, the, first, patent, under, the, act, was, granted, on, july, 31, 1790, to, samuel, hopkins, of, vermont, for, a, method, of, producing, potash, potassium, carbonate, a, revised, patent, law, was, passed, in, 1793, and, in, 1836, a, major, revision, was, passed, the, 1836, law, instituted, a, significantly, more, rigorous, application, process, including, the, establishment, of, an, examination, system, between, 1790, and, 1836, about, ten, thousand, patents, were, granted, by, the, american, civil, war, about, 80, 000, patents, had, been, granted, in, the, us, married, women, were, historically, precluded, from, obtaining, patents, while, section, 1, of, the, patent, act, of, 1790, did, refer, to, she, married, women, were, unable, to, own, property, in, their, own, name, and, were, also, prohibited, from, rights, to, their, own, income, including, income, from, anything, they, invented, this, historical, gender, gap, has, lessened, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, however, disparity, is, still, prevalent, in, the, uk, for, example, only, 8, of, inventors, were, female, as, of, 2015, this, can, partly, be, attributed, to, historical, barriers, for, women, to, obtain, patents, as, well, as, to, the, fact, that, women, are, underrepresented, in, traditionally, patent, intensive, sectors, particularly, stem, sectors, marcowitz, bitton, et, al, argue, that, the, gender, gap, in, patents, is, also, a, result, of, internal, bias, within, the, patent, system, the, number, of, patent, applications, filed, each, year, has, been, growing, for, most, countries, although, not, smoothly, and, jumps, in, activity, are, often, observed, due, to, changes, in, local, laws, the, high, number, of, patent, families, for, spain, in, the, 1800s, is, related, to, the, superior, preservation, and, cataloguing, of, the, data, by, spanish, patent, and, trademark, office, compared, to, other, countries, see, 1836, u, s, patent, office, fire, the, us, was, the, world, s, leader, in, terms, of, patent, families, filed, between, 1900, and, 1966, when, japan, took, over, since, 2007, pr, china, leads, however, in, most, technologically, advanced, countries, see, for, example, france, italy, japan, spain, sweden, the, uk, in, the, figure, on, the, right, as, well, as, in, poland, the, total, i, e, regardless, of, the, priority, inventors, country, number, of, patent, families, filed, there, have, been, declining, in, absolute, numbers, since, c, 1970s, 1980s, the, decline, is, even, more, pronounced, when, the, number, of, patent, applications, is, normalized, by, the, country, s, population, each, year, or, when, the, country, of, origin, rather, than, country, of, filing, is, used, for, the, us, the, population, normalized, peak, in, patenting, occurred, in, 1915, and, the, number, of, subsequent, patents, induced, per, patent, has, been, mostly, declining, since, 1926, a, study, of, 4, 512, patents, obtained, by, stanford, university, between, 1970, and, 2020, showed, that, the, university, s, patenting, activity, plateaued, in, the, 2010s, incidentally, only, 20, of, stanford, patents, in, that, dataset, produced, a, positive, net, income, for, the, university, while, the, rest, was, a, net, loss, similar, declines, have, been, noted, not, only, for, the, number, of, patents, but, also, for, other, measures, of, innovation, output, several, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, as, explanations, for, the, observed, decline, a, patent, does, not, give, a, right, to, make, or, use, or, sell, an, invention, rather, a, patent, provides, from, a, legal, standpoint, the, right, to, exclude, others, from, making, using, selling, offering, for, sale, or, importing, the, patented, invention, for, the, term, of, the, patent, which, is, usually, 20, years, from, the, filing, date, subject, to, the, payment, of, maintenance, fees, from, an, economic, and, practical, standpoint, however, a, patent, is, better, and, perhaps, more, precisely, regarded, as, conferring, upon, its, proprietor, a, right, to, try, to, exclude, by, asserting, the, patent, in, court, for, many, granted, patents, turn, out, to, be, invalid, once, their, proprietors, attempt, to, assert, them, in, court, a, patent, is, a, limited, property, right, the, government, gives, inventors, in, exchange, for, their, agreement, to, share, details, of, their, inventions, with, the, public, like, any, other, property, right, it, may, be, sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned, or, transferred, given, away, or, simply, abandoned, a, patent, being, an, exclusionary, right, does, not, necessarily, give, the, patent, owner, the, right, to, exploit, the, invention, subject, to, the, patent, for, example, many, inventions, are, improvements, of, prior, inventions, that, may, still, be, covered, by, someone, else, s, patent, if, an, inventor, obtains, a, patent, on, improvements, to, an, existing, invention, which, is, still, under, patent, they, can, only, legally, use, the, improved, invention, if, the, patent, holder, of, the, original, invention, gives, permission, which, they, may, refuse, some, countries, have, working, provisions, that, require, the, invention, be, exploited, in, the, jurisdiction, it, covers, consequences, of, not, working, an, invention, vary, from, one, country, to, another, ranging, from, revocation, of, the, patent, rights, to, the, awarding, of, a, compulsory, license, awarded, by, the, courts, to, a, party, wishing, to, exploit, a, patented, invention, the, patentee, has, the, opportunity, to, challenge, the, revocation, or, license, but, is, usually, required, to, provide, evidence, that, the, reasonable, requirements, of, the, public, have, been, met, by, the, working, of, invention, in, most, jurisdictions, there, are, ways, for, third, parties, to, challenge, the, validity, of, an, allowed, or, issued, patent, at, the, national, patent, office, these, are, called, opposition, proceedings, it, is, also, possible, to, challenge, the, validity, of, a, patent, in, court, in, either, case, the, challenging, party, tries, to, prove, that, the, patent, should, never, have, been, granted, there, are, several, grounds, for, challenges, the, claimed, subject, matter, is, not, patentable, subject, matter, at, all, the, claimed, subject, matter, was, actually, not, new, or, was, obvious, to, the, person, skilled, in, the, art, at, the, time, the, application, was, filed, or, that, some, kind, of, fraud, was, committed, during, prosecution, with, regard, to, listing, of, inventors, representations, about, when, discoveries, were, made, etc, patents, can, be, found, to, be, invalid, in, whole, or, in, part, for, any, of, these, reasons, patent, infringement, occurs, when, a, third, party, without, authorization, from, the, patentee, makes, uses, or, sells, a, patented, invention, patents, however, are, enforced, on, a, national, basis, the, making, of, an, item, in, china, for, example, that, would, infringe, a, us, patent, would, not, constitute, infringement, under, us, patent, law, unless, the, item, were, imported, into, the, us, infringement, includes, literal, infringement, of, a, patent, meaning, they, are, performing, a, prohibited, act, that, is, protected, against, by, the, patent, there, is, also, the, doctrine, of, equivalents, this, doctrine, protects, from, someone, creating, a, product, that, is, basically, by, all, rights, the, same, product, that, is, protected, with, just, a, few, modifications, in, some, countries, like, the, united, states, there, is, liability, for, another, two, forms, of, infringement, one, is, contributory, infringement, which, is, participating, in, another, s, infringement, this, could, be, a, company, helping, another, company, to, create, a, patented, product, or, selling, the, patented, product, which, is, created, by, another, company, there, is, also, inducement, to, infringement, which, is, when, a, party, induces, or, assists, another, party, in, violating, a, patent, an, example, of, this, would, be, a, company, paying, another, party, to, create, a, patented, product, in, order, to, reduce, their, competitor, s, market, share, this, is, important, when, it, comes, to, gray, market, goods, which, is, when, a, patent, owner, sells, a, product, in, country, a, wherein, they, have, the, product, patented, then, another, party, buys, and, sells, it, without, the, owner, s, permission, in, country, b, wherein, the, owner, also, has, a, patent, for, the, product, with, either, national, or, regional, exhaustion, being, the, law, the, in, country, b, the, owner, may, still, be, able, to, enforce, their, patent, rights, however, if, country, b, has, a, policy, of, international, exhaustion, then, the, patent, owner, will, have, no, legal, grounds, for, enforcing, the, patent, in, country, b, as, it, was, already, sold, in, a, different, country, patents, can, generally, only, be, enforced, through, civil, lawsuits, for, example, for, a, us, patent, by, an, action, for, patent, infringement, in, a, united, states, federal, district, court, although, some, countries, such, as, france, and, austria, have, criminal, penalties, for, wanton, infringement, typically, the, patent, owner, seeks, monetary, compensation, damages, for, past, infringement, and, seeks, an, injunction, that, prohibits, the, defendant, from, engaging, in, future, acts, of, infringement, or, seeks, either, damages, or, injunction, to, prove, infringement, the, patent, owner, must, establish, that, the, accused, infringer, practises, all, the, requirements, of, at, least, one, of, the, claims, of, the, patent, in, many, jurisdictions, the, scope, of, the, patent, may, not, be, limited, to, what, is, literally, stated, in, the, claims, for, example, due, to, the, doctrine, of, equivalents, an, accused, infringer, has, the, right, to, challenge, the, validity, of, the, patent, allegedly, being, infringed, in, a, counterclaim, a, patent, can, be, found, invalid, on, grounds, described, in, the, relevant, patent, laws, which, vary, between, countries, often, the, grounds, are, a, subset, of, requirements, for, patentability, in, the, relevant, country, although, an, infringer, is, generally, free, to, rely, on, any, available, ground, of, invalidity, such, as, a, prior, publication, for, example, some, countries, have, sanctions, to, prevent, the, same, validity, questions, being, relitigated, an, example, is, the, uk, certificate, of, contested, validity, patent, licensing, agreements, are, contracts, in, which, the, patent, owner, the, licensor, agrees, to, grant, the, licensee, the, right, to, make, use, sell, or, import, the, claimed, invention, usually, in, return, for, a, royalty, or, other, compensation, it, is, common, for, companies, engaged, in, complex, technical, fields, to, enter, into, multiple, license, agreements, associated, with, the, production, of, a, single, product, moreover, it, is, equally, common, for, competitors, in, such, fields, to, license, patents, to, each, other, under, cross, licensing, agreements, in, order, to, share, the, benefits, of, using, each, other, s, patented, inventions, freedom, licenses, like, the, apache, 2, 0, license, are, a, hybrid, of, copyright, trademark, patent, license, contract, due, to, the, bundling, nature, of, the, three, intellectual, properties, in, one, central, license, this, can, make, it, difficult, to, enforce, because, patent, licenses, cannot, be, granted, this, way, under, copyright, and, would, have, to, be, considered, a, contract, in, most, countries, both, natural, persons, and, corporate, entities, may, apply, for, a, patent, in, the, united, states, however, only, the, inventor, s, may, apply, for, a, patent, although, it, may, be, assigned, to, a, corporate, entity, subsequently, and, inventors, may, be, required, to, assign, inventions, to, their, employers, under, an, employment, contract, in, most, european, countries, ownership, of, an, invention, may, pass, from, the, inventor, to, their, employer, by, rule, of, law, if, the, invention, was, made, in, the, course, of, the, inventor, s, normal, or, specifically, assigned, employment, duties, where, an, invention, might, reasonably, be, expected, to, result, from, carrying, out, those, duties, or, if, the, inventor, had, a, special, obligation, to, further, the, interests, of, the, employer, s, company, applications, by, artificial, intelligence, systems, such, as, dabus, have, been, rejected, in, the, us, the, uk, and, at, the, european, patent, office, on, the, grounds, they, are, not, natural, persons, the, inventors, their, successors, or, their, assignees, become, the, proprietors, of, the, patent, when, and, if, it, is, granted, if, a, patent, is, granted, to, more, than, one, proprietor, the, laws, of, the, country, in, question, and, any, agreement, between, the, proprietors, may, affect, the, extent, to, which, each, proprietor, can, exploit, the, patent, for, example, in, some, countries, each, proprietor, may, freely, license, or, assign, their, rights, in, the, patent, to, another, person, while, the, law, in, other, countries, prohibits, such, actions, without, the, permission, of, the, other, proprietor, s, the, ability, to, assign, ownership, rights, increases, the, liquidity, of, a, patent, as, property, inventors, can, obtain, patents, and, then, sell, them, to, third, parties, the, third, parties, then, own, the, patents, and, have, the, same, rights, to, prevent, others, from, exploiting, the, claimed, inventions, as, if, they, had, originally, made, the, inventions, themselves, the, grant, and, enforcement, of, patents, are, governed, by, national, laws, and, also, by, international, treaties, where, those, treaties, have, been, given, effect, in, national, laws, patents, are, granted, by, national, or, regional, patent, offices, i, e, national, or, regional, administrative, authorities, a, given, patent, is, therefore, only, useful, for, protecting, an, invention, in, the, country, in, which, that, patent, is, granted, in, other, words, patent, law, is, territorial, in, nature, when, a, patent, application, is, published, the, invention, disclosed, in, the, application, becomes, prior, art, and, enters, the, public, domain, if, not, protected, by, other, patents, in, countries, where, a, patent, applicant, does, not, seek, protection, the, application, thus, generally, becoming, prior, art, against, anyone, including, the, applicant, who, might, seek, patent, protection, for, the, invention, in, those, countries, commonly, a, nation, or, a, group, of, nations, forms, a, patent, office, with, responsibility, for, operating, that, nation, s, patent, system, within, the, relevant, patent, laws, the, patent, office, generally, has, responsibility, for, the, grant, of, patents, with, infringement, being, the, remit, of, national, courts, the, authority, for, patent, statutes, in, different, countries, varies, in, the, uk, substantive, patent, law, is, contained, in, the, patents, act, 1977, as, amended, in, the, united, states, the, constitution, empowers, congress, to, make, laws, to, promote, the, progress, of, science, and, useful, arts, the, laws, congress, passed, are, codified, in, title, 35, of, the, united, states, code, and, created, the, united, states, patent, and, trademark, office, there, is, a, trend, towards, global, harmonization, of, patent, laws, with, the, world, trade, organization, wto, being, particularly, active, in, this, area, the, trips, agreement, has, been, largely, successful, in, providing, a, forum, for, nations, to, agree, on, an, aligned, set, of, patent, laws, conformity, with, the, trips, agreement, is, a, requirement, of, admission, to, the, wto, and, so, compliance, is, seen, by, many, nations, as, important, this, has, also, led, to, many, developing, nations, which, may, historically, have, developed, different, laws, to, aid, their, development, enforcing, patents, laws, in, line, with, global, practice, internationally, there, are, international, treaty, procedures, such, as, the, procedures, under, the, european, patent, convention, epc, that, centralize, some, portion, of, the, filing, and, examination, procedure, similar, arrangements, exist, among, the, member, states, of, aripo, and, oapi, the, analogous, treaties, among, african, countries, and, the, nine, cis, member, states, that, have, formed, the, eurasian, patent, organization, a, key, international, convention, relating, to, patents, is, the, paris, convention, for, the, protection, of, industrial, property, initially, signed, in, 1883, the, paris, convention, sets, out, a, range, of, basic, rules, relating, to, patents, and, although, the, convention, does, not, have, direct, legal, effect, in, all, national, jurisdictions, the, principles, of, the, convention, are, incorporated, into, all, notable, current, patent, systems, the, paris, convention, set, a, minimum, patent, protection, of, 20, years, but, the, most, significant, aspect, of, the, convention, is, the, provision, of, the, right, to, claim, priority, filing, an, application, in, any, one, member, state, of, the, paris, convention, preserves, the, right, for, one, year, to, file, in, any, other, member, state, and, receive, the, benefit, of, the, original, filing, date, another, key, treaty, is, the, patent, cooperation, treaty, pct, administered, by, the, world, intellectual, property, organization, wipo, and, covering, more, than, 150, countries, the, patent, cooperation, treaty, provides, a, unified, procedure, for, filing, patent, applications, to, protect, inventions, in, each, of, its, contracting, states, along, with, giving, owners, a, 30, month, priority, for, applications, as, opposed, to, the, standard, 12, the, paris, convention, granted, a, patent, application, filed, under, the, pct, is, called, an, international, application, or, pct, application, the, steps, for, pct, applications, are, as, follows, 1, filing, the, pct, patent, application, 2, examination, during, the, international, phase, 3, examination, during, the, national, phase, alongside, these, international, agreements, for, patents, there, was, the, patent, law, treaty, plt, this, treaty, standardized, the, filing, date, requirements, standardized, the, application, and, forms, allows, for, electronic, communication, and, filing, and, avoids, unintentional, loss, of, rights, and, simplifies, patent, office, procedures, sometimes, nations, grant, others, other, than, the, patent, owner, permissions, to, create, a, patented, product, based, on, different, situations, that, align, with, public, policy, or, public, interest, these, may, include, compulsory, licenses, scientific, research, and, in, transit, in, country, after, two, decades, of, drafting, the, wipo, s, intergovernmental, committee, on, intellectual, property, and, genetic, resources, traditional, knowledge, and, folklore, moved, to, a, diplomatic, conference, in, may, 2024, and, adopted, the, wipo, treaty, on, intellectual, property, genetic, resources, and, associated, traditional, knowledge, gratk, treaty, mandating, patent, disclosure, requirements, for, patents, based, on, genetic, resources, and, associated, traditional, knowledge, from, being, granted, the, treaty, contemplates, revocation, for, patents, incorrectly, filed, the, treaty, and, in, particular, its, planned, extension, is, seen, as, complementing, the, nagoya, protocol, to, the, convention, on, biological, diversity, and, its, system, of, access, and, benefit, sharing, representatives, of, indigenous, peoples, view, the, gratk, treaty, as, a, first, step, towards, guaranteeing, just, and, transparent, access, to, these, resources, before, filing, for, an, application, which, must, be, paid, for, whether, a, patent, is, granted, or, not, a, person, will, want, to, ensure, that, their, material, is, patentable, patentable, material, must, be, synthetic, meaning, that, anything, natural, cannot, be, patented, for, example, minerals, materials, genes, facts, organisms, and, biological, processes, cannot, be, patented, but, if, someone, were, to, apply, an, inventive, non, obvious, step, to, them, to, synthesize, something, new, the, result, could, be, patentable, that, includes, genetically, engineered, strains, of, bacteria, as, was, decided, in, diamond, v, chakrabarty, patentability, also, depends, on, public, policy, and, ethical, standards, additionally, patentable, materials, must, be, novel, useful, and, a, non, obvious, inventive, step, a, patent, is, requested, by, filing, a, written, application, at, the, relevant, patent, office, the, person, or, company, filing, the, application, is, referred, to, as, the, applicant, the, applicant, may, be, the, inventor, or, its, assignee, the, application, contains, a, description, of, how, to, make, and, use, the, invention, that, must, provide, sufficient, detail, for, a, person, skilled, in, the, art, i, e, the, relevant, area, of, technology, to, make, and, use, the, invention, in, some, countries, there, are, requirements, for, providing, specific, information, such, as, the, usefulness, of, the, invention, the, best, mode, of, performing, the, invention, known, to, the, inventor, or, the, technical, problem, or, problems, solved, by, the, invention, drawings, illustrating, the, invention, may, also, be, provided, the, application, also, includes, one, or, more, claims, that, define, what, a, patent, covers, or, the, scope, of, protection, after, filing, an, application, is, often, referred, to, as, patent, pending, while, this, term, does, not, confer, legal, protection, and, a, patent, cannot, be, enforced, until, granted, it, serves, to, provide, warning, to, potential, infringers, that, if, the, patent, is, issued, they, may, be, liable, for, damages, once, filed, a, patent, application, is, prosecuted, a, patent, examiner, reviews, the, patent, application, to, determine, if, it, meets, the, patentability, requirements, of, that, country, if, the, application, does, not, comply, objections, are, communicated, to, the, applicant, or, their, patent, agent, or, attorney, through, an, office, action, to, which, the, applicant, may, respond, the, number, of, office, actions, and, responses, that, may, occur, vary, from, country, to, country, but, eventually, a, final, rejection, is, sent, by, the, patent, office, or, the, patent, application, is, granted, which, after, the, payment, of, additional, fees, leads, to, an, issued, enforceable, patent, in, some, jurisdictions, there, are, opportunities, for, third, parties, to, bring, an, opposition, proceeding, between, grant, and, issuance, or, post, issuance, once, granted, the, patent, is, subject, in, most, countries, to, renewal, fees, to, keep, the, patent, in, force, these, fees, are, generally, payable, on, a, yearly, basis, some, countries, or, regional, patent, offices, e, g, the, european, patent, office, also, require, annual, renewal, fees, to, be, paid, for, a, patent, application, before, it, is, granted, in, the, us, patent, maintenance, fees, are, due, on, 3, 5, 7, 5, and, 11, 5, anniversaries, of, the, patent, issuance, only, ca, 50, of, issued, us, patents, are, maintained, full, term, large, corporations, tend, to, pay, maintenance, fees, through, the, full, term, while, small, companies, are, more, likely, to, abandon, their, patents, earlier, even, though, the, due, fees, are, ca, 5, times, lower, for, small, businesses, microentities, the, costs, of, preparing, and, filing, a, patent, application, prosecuting, it, until, grant, and, maintaining, the, patent, vary, from, one, jurisdiction, to, another, and, may, also, be, dependent, upon, the, type, and, complexity, of, the, invention, and, on, the, type, of, patent, the, european, patent, office, estimated, in, 2005, that, the, average, cost, of, obtaining, a, european, patent, via, a, euro, direct, application, i, e, not, based, on, a, pct, application, and, maintaining, the, patent, for, a, 10, year, term, was, around, 32, 000, since, the, london, agreement, entered, into, force, on, may, 1, 2008, this, estimation, is, however, no, longer, up, to, date, since, fewer, translations, are, required, after, a, patent, is, issued, in, most, countries, patent, maintenance, payments, are, required, in, some, countries, e, g, russia, fees, are, due, every, year, and, the, amount, due, does, not, change, much, in, other, countries, e, g, us, payments, are, due, ca, every, 4th, year, after, the, grant, date, and, the, amount, due, increases, every, time, a, 2023, study, by, rochester, institute, of, technology, found, the, full, term, maintenance, rate, of, issued, us, patents, has, been, fairly, constant, 40, 50, since, 1992, full, term, patents, have, more, issued, claims, and, receive, on, average, more, citations, than, earlier, expired, patents, the, european, patent, office, charges, annual, fees, for, pending, applications, also, between, 2012, and, 2016, ecuador, increased, its, patent, maintenance, fees, ten, fold, briefly, becoming, the, most, expensive, country, to, maintain, patents, in, the, united, states, in, 2000, the, cost, of, obtaining, a, patent, patent, prosecution, was, estimated, to, be, from, 10, 000, to, 30, 000, per, patent, when, patent, litigation, is, involved, which, in, year, 1999, happened, in, about, 1, 600, cases, compared, to, 153, 000, patents, issued, in, the, same, year, costs, increase, significantly, although, 95, of, patent, litigation, cases, are, settled, out, of, court, those, that, reach, the, courts, have, legal, costs, on, the, order, of, a, million, dollars, per, case, not, including, associated, business, costs, non, national, treatments, in, national, patent, offices, had, been, prevalent, among, the, northern, countries, until, they, were, prohibited, after, the, negotiation, of, the, paris, convention, for, the, protection, of, industrial, property, according, to, articles, 2, and, 3, of, this, treaty, juristic, and, natural, persons, who, are, either, national, of, or, domiciled, in, a, state, party, to, the, convention, shall, as, regards, the, protection, of, industrial, property, enjoy, in, all, the, other, countries, of, the, union, the, advantages, that, their, respective, laws, grant, to, nationals, in, addition, the, trips, agreement, explicitly, prohibits, any, such, discrimination, trips, agreement, article, 27, 1, states, that, patents, shall, be, available, and, patent, rights, enjoyable, without, discrimination, as, to, the, place, of, invention, the, field, of, technology, and, whether, products, are, imported, or, locally, produced, a, defensive, publication, is, the, act, of, publishing, a, detailed, description, of, a, new, invention, without, patenting, it, so, as, to, establish, prior, art, and, public, identification, as, the, creator, originator, of, an, invention, although, a, defensive, publication, can, also, be, anonymous, a, defensive, publication, prevents, others, from, later, being, able, to, patent, the, invention, a, trade, secret, is, information, that, is, intentionally, kept, confidential, and, that, provides, a, competitive, advantage, to, its, possessor, trade, secrets, are, protected, by, non, disclosure, agreement, and, labour, law, each, of, which, prevents, information, leaks, such, as, breaches, of, confidentiality, and, industrial, espionage, compared, to, patents, the, advantages, of, trade, secrets, are, that, the, value, of, a, trade, secret, continues, until, it, is, made, public, whereas, a, patent, is, only, in, force, for, a, specified, time, after, which, others, may, freely, copy, the, invention, does, not, require, payment, of, fees, to, governmental, agencies, or, filing, paperwork, has, an, immediate, effect, and, does, not, require, any, disclosure, of, information, to, the, public, the, key, disadvantage, of, a, trade, secret, is, its, vulnerability, to, reverse, engineering, primary, incentives, embodied, in, the, patent, system, include, incentives, to, invent, in, the, first, place, to, disclose, the, invention, once, made, to, invest, the, sums, necessary, to, experiment, produce, and, market, the, invention, and, to, design, around, and, improve, upon, earlier, patents, patents, provide, incentives, for, economically, efficient, research, and, development, r, d, a, study, conducted, annually, by, the, institute, for, prospective, technological, studies, ipts, shows, that, the, 2, 000, largest, global, companies, invested, more, than, 430, billion, euros, in, 2008, in, their, r, d, departments, if, the, investments, can, be, considered, as, inputs, of, r, d, real, products, and, patents, are, the, outputs, based, on, these, groups, a, project, named, corporate, invention, board, had, measured, and, analyzed, the, patent, portfolios, to, produce, an, original, picture, of, their, technological, profiles, supporters, of, patents, argue, that, without, patent, protection, r, d, spending, would, be, significantly, less, or, eliminated, altogether, limiting, the, possibility, of, technological, advances, or, breakthroughs, corporations, would, be, much, more, conservative, about, the, r, d, investments, they, made, as, third, parties, would, be, free, to, exploit, any, developments, the, logical, consequence, of, more, efficient, r, d, is, a, more, efficient, national, economy, an, increase, in, patenting, has, proven, to, be, linked, with, an, increase, of, national, income, a, 2009, study, on, patent, effects, in, various, countries, around, the, world, finds, for, instance, that, a, 10, increase, in, patenting, in, 1910, led, on, average, to, a, 9, to, 11, higher, level, of, per, capita, gdp, in, 1960, the, positive, effects, of, patenting, on, national, income, were, found, to, be, particularly, strong, in, the, u, s, switzerland, and, sweden, however, patenting, is, not, the, only, factor, influencing, gdp, growth, among, others, schooling, also, plays, a, big, role, the, patent, internalizes, the, externality, by, giving, the, a, property, right, over, its, invention, in, accordance, with, the, original, definition, of, the, term, patent, patents, are, intended, to, facilitate, and, encourage, disclosure, of, innovations, into, the, public, domain, for, the, common, good, thus, patenting, can, be, viewed, as, contributing, to, open, hardware, after, an, embargo, period, usually, of, 20, years, if, inventors, did, not, have, the, legal, protection, of, patents, in, many, cases, they, might, prefer, or, tend, to, keep, their, inventions, secret, e, g, keep, trade, secrets, awarding, patents, generally, makes, the, details, of, new, technology, publicly, available, for, exploitation, by, anyone, after, the, patent, expires, or, for, further, improvement, by, other, inventors, furthermore, when, a, patent, s, term, has, expired, the, public, record, ensures, that, the, patentee, s, invention, is, not, lost, to, humanity, one, effect, of, modern, patent, usage, is, that, a, small, time, inventor, who, can, afford, both, the, patenting, process, and, the, defense, of, the, patent, can, use, the, exclusive, right, status, to, become, a, licensor, this, allows, the, inventor, to, accumulate, capital, from, licensing, the, invention, and, may, allow, innovation, to, occur, because, he, or, she, may, choose, not, to, manage, a, manufacturing, buildup, for, the, invention, thus, the, inventor, s, time, and, energy, can, be, spent, on, pure, innovation, allowing, others, to, concentrate, on, manufacturability, another, effect, of, modern, patent, usage, is, the, social, benefit, s, of, technology, disclosure, although, patentees, usually, end, up, not, reaping, benefit, from, their, patent, monopoly, the, society, still, benefits, from, patent, disclosures, also, patents, both, enable, and, incentivize, competitors, to, design, around, or, to, invent, around, according, to, r, s, praveen, raj, the, patented, invention, this, may, promote, healthy, competition, among, manufacturers, resulting, in, gradual, improvements, of, the, technology, base, legal, scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and, trade, organizations, have, held, differing, views, on, patents, and, engaged, in, contentious, debates, on, the, subject, critical, perspectives, emerged, in, the, nineteenth, century, that, were, especially, based, on, the, principles, of, free, trade, 262, 263, contemporary, criticisms, have, echoed, those, arguments, claiming, that, patents, block, innovation, and, waste, resources, e, g, with, patent, related, overheads, that, could, otherwise, be, used, productively, to, improve, technology, these, and, other, research, findings, that, patents, decreased, innovation, because, of, the, following, mechanisms, boldrin, and, levine, conclude, our, preferred, policy, solution, is, to, abolish, patents, entirely, and, to, find, other, legislative, instruments, less, open, to, lobbying, and, rent, seeking, to, foster, innovation, when, there, is, clear, evidence, that, laissez, faire, undersupplies, it, abolishing, patents, may, be, politically, challenging, in, some, countries, however, as, the, primary, economic, theories, supporting, patent, law, hold, that, inventors, and, innovators, need, patents, to, recoup, the, costs, associated, with, research, inventing, and, commercializing, this, reasoning, is, weakened, if, the, new, technologies, decrease, these, costs, a, 2016, paper, argued, for, substantial, weakening, of, patents, because, current, technologies, e, g, 3d, printing, cloud, computing, synthetic, biology, etc, have, reduced, the, cost, of, innovation, debates, over, the, usefulness, of, patents, for, their, primary, objective, are, part, of, a, larger, discourse, on, intellectual, property, protection, which, also, reflects, differing, perspectives, on, copyright
