https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle
a, battle, is, an, occurrence, of, combat, in, warfare, between, opposing, military, units, of, any, number, or, size, a, war, usually, consists, of, multiple, battles, in, general, a, battle, is, a, military, engagement, that, is, well, defined, in, duration, area, and, force, commitment, an, engagement, with, only, limited, commitment, between, the, forces, and, without, decisive, results, is, sometimes, called, a, skirmish, the, word, battle, can, also, be, used, infrequently, to, refer, to, an, entire, operational, campaign, although, this, usage, greatly, diverges, from, its, conventional, or, customary, meaning, generally, the, word, battle, is, used, for, such, campaigns, if, referring, to, a, protracted, combat, encounter, in, which, either, one, or, both, of, the, combatants, had, the, same, methods, resources, and, strategic, objectives, throughout, the, encounter, some, prominent, examples, of, this, would, be, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, battle, of, britain, and, the, battle, of, france, all, in, world, war, ii, wars, and, military, campaigns, are, guided, by, military, strategy, whereas, battles, take, place, on, a, level, of, planning, and, execution, known, as, operational, mobility, german, strategist, carl, von, clausewitz, stated, that, the, employment, of, battles, to, achieve, the, object, of, war, was, the, essence, of, strategy, battle, is, a, loanword, from, the, old, french, bataille, first, attested, in, 1297, from, late, latin, battualia, meaning, exercise, of, soldiers, and, gladiators, in, fighting, and, fencing, from, late, latin, taken, from, germanic, battuere, beat, from, which, the, english, word, battery, is, also, derived, via, middle, english, batri, the, defining, characteristic, of, the, fight, as, a, concept, in, military, science, has, changed, with, the, variations, in, the, organisation, employment, and, technology, of, military, forces, the, english, military, historian, john, keegan, suggested, an, ideal, definition, of, battle, as, something, which, happens, between, two, armies, leading, to, the, moral, then, physical, disintegration, of, one, or, the, other, of, them, but, the, origins, and, outcomes, of, battles, can, rarely, be, summarized, so, neatly, battle, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, is, defined, as, the, combat, between, large, components, of, the, forces, in, a, military, campaign, used, to, achieve, military, objectives, where, the, duration, of, the, battle, is, longer, than, a, week, it, is, often, for, reasons, of, planning, called, an, operation, battles, can, be, planned, encountered, or, forced, by, one, side, when, the, other, is, unable, to, withdraw, from, combat, a, battle, always, has, as, its, purpose, the, reaching, of, a, mission, goal, by, use, of, military, force, a, victory, in, the, battle, is, achieved, when, one, of, the, opposing, sides, forces, the, other, to, abandon, its, mission, and, surrender, its, forces, routs, the, other, i, e, forces, it, to, retreat, or, renders, it, militarily, ineffective, for, further, combat, operations, or, annihilates, the, latter, resulting, in, their, deaths, or, capture, a, battle, may, end, in, a, pyrrhic, victory, which, ultimately, favors, the, defeated, party, if, no, resolution, is, reached, in, a, battle, it, can, result, in, a, stalemate, a, conflict, in, which, one, side, is, unwilling, to, reach, a, decision, by, a, direct, battle, using, conventional, warfare, often, becomes, an, insurgency, until, the, 19th, century, the, majority, of, battles, were, of, short, duration, many, lasting, a, part, of, a, day, the, battle, of, preston, 1648, the, battle, of, nations, 1813, and, the, battle, of, gettysburg, 1863, were, exceptional, in, lasting, three, days, this, was, mainly, due, to, the, difficulty, of, supplying, armies, in, the, field, or, conducting, night, operations, the, means, of, prolonging, a, battle, was, typically, with, siege, warfare, improvements, in, transport, and, the, sudden, evolving, of, trench, warfare, with, its, siege, like, nature, during, the, first, world, war, in, the, 20th, century, lengthened, the, duration, of, battles, to, days, and, weeks, this, created, the, requirement, for, unit, rotation, to, prevent, combat, fatigue, with, troops, preferably, not, remaining, in, a, combat, area, of, operations, for, more, than, a, month, the, use, of, the, term, battle, in, military, history, has, led, to, its, misuse, when, referring, to, almost, any, scale, of, combat, notably, by, strategic, forces, involving, hundreds, of, thousands, of, troops, that, may, be, engaged, in, either, one, battle, at, a, time, battle, of, leipzig, or, operations, battle, of, wuhan, the, space, a, battle, occupies, depends, on, the, range, of, the, weapons, of, the, combatants, a, battle, in, this, broader, sense, may, be, of, long, duration, and, take, place, over, a, large, area, as, in, the, case, of, the, battle, of, britain, or, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, until, the, advent, of, artillery, and, aircraft, battles, were, fought, with, the, two, sides, within, sight, if, not, reach, of, each, other, the, depth, of, the, battlefield, has, also, increased, in, modern, warfare, with, inclusion, of, the, supporting, units, in, the, rear, areas, supply, artillery, medical, personnel, etc, often, outnumber, the, front, line, combat, troops, battles, are, made, up, of, a, multitude, of, individual, combats, skirmishes, and, small, engagements, and, the, combatants, will, usually, only, experience, a, small, part, of, the, battle, to, the, infantryman, there, may, be, little, to, distinguish, between, combat, as, part, of, a, minor, raid, or, a, big, offensive, nor, is, it, likely, that, he, anticipates, the, future, course, of, the, battle, few, of, the, british, infantry, who, went, over, the, top, on, the, first, day, on, the, somme, 1, july, 1916, would, have, anticipated, that, the, battle, would, last, five, months, some, of, the, allied, infantry, who, had, just, dealt, a, crushing, defeat, to, the, french, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, fully, expected, to, have, to, fight, again, the, next, day, at, the, battle, of, wavre, battlespace, is, a, unified, strategic, concept, to, integrate, and, combine, armed, forces, for, the, military, theatre, of, operations, including, air, information, land, sea, and, space, it, includes, the, environment, factors, and, conditions, that, must, be, understood, to, apply, combat, power, protect, the, force, or, complete, the, mission, comprising, enemy, and, friendly, armed, forces, facilities, weather, terrain, and, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, battles, are, decided, by, various, factors, the, number, and, quality, of, combatants, and, equipment, the, skill, of, commanders, and, terrain, are, among, the, most, prominent, weapons, and, armour, can, be, decisive, on, many, occasions, armies, have, achieved, victory, through, more, advanced, weapons, than, those, of, their, opponents, an, extreme, example, was, in, the, battle, of, omdurman, in, which, a, large, army, of, sudanese, mahdists, armed, in, a, traditional, manner, were, destroyed, by, an, anglo, egyptian, force, equipped, with, maxim, machine, guns, and, artillery, on, some, occasions, simple, weapons, employed, in, an, unorthodox, fashion, have, proven, advantageous, swiss, pikemen, gained, many, victories, through, their, ability, to, transform, a, traditionally, defensive, weapon, into, an, offensive, one, zulus, in, the, early, 19th, century, were, victorious, in, battles, against, their, rivals, in, part, because, they, adopted, a, new, kind, of, spear, the, iklwa, forces, with, inferior, weapons, have, still, emerged, victorious, at, times, for, example, in, the, wars, of, scottish, independence, disciplined, troops, are, often, of, greater, importance, at, the, battle, of, alesia, the, romans, were, greatly, outnumbered, but, won, because, of, superior, training, battles, can, also, be, determined, by, terrain, capturing, high, ground, has, been, the, main, tactic, in, innumerable, battles, an, army, that, holds, the, high, ground, forces, the, enemy, to, climb, and, thus, wear, themselves, down, areas, of, jungle, and, forest, with, dense, vegetation, act, as, force, multipliers, of, benefit, to, inferior, armies, terrain, may, have, lost, importance, in, modern, warfare, due, to, the, advent, of, aircraft, though, the, terrain, is, still, vital, for, camouflage, especially, for, guerrilla, warfare, generals, and, commanders, also, play, an, important, role, hannibal, julius, caesar, khalid, ibn, walid, subutai, and, napoleon, bonaparte, were, all, skilled, generals, and, their, armies, were, extremely, successful, at, times, an, army, that, can, trust, the, commands, of, their, leaders, with, conviction, in, its, success, invariably, has, a, higher, morale, than, an, army, that, doubts, its, every, move, the, british, in, the, naval, battle, of, trafalgar, owed, its, success, to, the, reputation, of, admiral, lord, nelson, battles, can, be, fought, on, land, at, sea, and, in, the, air, naval, battles, have, occurred, since, before, the, 5th, century, bc, air, battles, have, been, far, less, common, due, to, their, late, conception, the, most, prominent, being, the, battle, of, britain, in, 1940, since, the, second, world, war, land, or, sea, battles, have, come, to, rely, on, air, support, during, the, battle, of, midway, five, aircraft, carriers, were, sunk, without, either, fleet, coming, into, direct, contact, battles, are, usually, hybrids, of, different, types, listed, above, a, decisive, battle, is, one, with, political, effects, determining, the, course, of, the, war, such, as, the, battle, of, smolensk, or, bringing, hostilities, to, an, end, such, as, the, battle, of, hastings, or, the, battle, of, hattin, a, decisive, battle, can, change, the, balance, of, power, or, boundaries, between, countries, the, concept, of, the, decisive, battle, became, popular, with, the, publication, in, 1851, of, edward, creasy, s, the, fifteen, decisive, battles, of, the, world, british, military, historians, j, f, c, fuller, the, decisive, battles, of, the, western, world, and, b, h, liddell, hart, decisive, wars, of, history, among, many, others, have, written, books, in, the, style, of, creasy, s, work, there, is, an, obvious, difference, in, the, way, battles, have, been, fought, early, battles, were, probably, fought, between, rival, hunting, bands, as, unorganized, crowds, during, the, battle, of, megiddo, the, first, reliably, documented, battle, in, the, fifteenth, century, bc, both, armies, were, organised, and, disciplined, during, the, many, wars, of, the, roman, empire, barbarians, continued, to, use, mob, tactics, as, the, age, of, enlightenment, dawned, armies, began, to, fight, in, highly, disciplined, lines, each, would, follow, the, orders, from, their, officers, and, fight, as, a, unit, instead, of, individuals, armies, were, divided, into, regiments, battalions, companies, and, platoons, these, armies, would, march, line, up, and, fire, in, divisions, native, americans, on, the, other, hand, did, not, fight, in, lines, using, guerrilla, tactics, american, colonists, and, european, forces, continued, using, disciplined, lines, into, the, american, civil, war, a, new, style, arose, from, the, 1850s, to, the, first, world, war, known, as, trench, warfare, which, also, led, to, tactical, radio, chemical, warfare, also, began, in, 1915, by, the, second, world, war, the, use, of, the, smaller, divisions, platoons, and, companies, became, much, more, important, as, precise, operations, became, vital, instead, of, the, trench, stalemate, of, 1915, 1917, in, the, second, world, war, battles, developed, where, small, groups, encountered, other, platoons, as, a, result, elite, squads, became, much, more, recognized, and, distinguishable, maneuver, warfare, also, returned, with, an, astonishing, pace, with, the, advent, of, the, tank, replacing, the, cannon, of, the, enlightenment, age, artillery, has, since, gradually, replaced, the, use, of, frontal, troops, modern, battles, resemble, those, of, the, second, world, war, along, with, indirect, combat, through, the, use, of, aircraft, and, missiles, which, has, come, to, constitute, a, large, portion, of, wars, in, place, of, battles, where, battles, are, now, mostly, reserved, for, capturing, cities, one, significant, difference, of, modern, naval, battles, as, opposed, to, earlier, forms, of, combat, is, the, use, of, marines, which, introduced, amphibious, warfare, today, a, marine, is, actually, an, infantry, regiment, that, sometimes, fights, solely, on, land, and, is, no, longer, tied, to, the, navy, a, good, example, of, an, ancient, naval, battle, is, the, battle, of, salamis, most, ancient, naval, battles, were, fought, by, fast, ships, using, the, battering, ram, to, sink, opposing, fleets, or, steer, close, enough, for, boarding, in, hand, to, hand, combat, troops, were, often, used, to, storm, enemy, ships, as, used, by, romans, and, pirates, this, tactic, was, usually, used, by, civilizations, that, could, not, beat, the, enemy, with, ranged, weaponry, another, invention, in, the, late, middle, ages, was, the, use, of, greek, fire, by, the, byzantines, which, was, used, to, set, enemy, fleets, on, fire, empty, demolition, ships, utilized, the, tactic, to, crash, into, opposing, ships, and, set, it, afire, with, an, explosion, after, the, invention, of, cannons, naval, warfare, became, useful, as, support, units, for, land, warfare, during, the, 19th, century, the, development, of, mines, led, to, a, new, type, of, naval, warfare, the, ironclad, first, used, in, the, american, civil, war, resistant, to, cannons, soon, made, the, wooden, ship, obsolete, the, invention, of, military, submarines, during, world, war, i, brought, naval, warfare, to, both, above, and, below, the, surface, with, the, development, of, military, aircraft, during, world, war, ii, battles, were, fought, in, the, sky, as, well, as, below, the, ocean, aircraft, carriers, have, since, become, the, central, unit, in, naval, warfare, acting, as, a, mobile, base, for, lethal, aircraft, although, the, use, of, aircraft, has, for, the, most, part, always, been, used, as, a, supplement, to, land, or, naval, engagements, since, their, first, major, military, use, in, world, war, i, aircraft, have, increasingly, taken, on, larger, roles, in, warfare, during, world, war, i, the, primary, use, was, for, reconnaissance, and, small, scale, bombardment, aircraft, began, becoming, much, more, prominent, in, the, spanish, civil, war, and, especially, world, war, ii, aircraft, design, began, specializing, primarily, into, two, types, bombers, which, carried, explosive, payloads, to, bomb, land, targets, or, ships, and, fighter, interceptors, which, were, used, to, either, intercept, incoming, aircraft, or, to, escort, and, protect, bombers, engagements, between, fighter, aircraft, were, known, as, dog, fights, some, of, the, more, notable, aerial, battles, in, this, period, include, the, battle, of, britain, and, the, battle, of, midway, another, important, use, of, aircraft, came, with, the, development, of, the, helicopter, which, first, became, heavily, used, during, the, vietnam, war, and, still, continues, to, be, widely, used, today, to, transport, and, augment, ground, forces, today, direct, engagements, between, aircraft, are, rare, the, most, modern, fighter, interceptors, carry, much, more, extensive, bombing, payloads, and, are, used, to, bomb, precision, land, targets, rather, than, to, fight, other, aircraft, anti, aircraft, batteries, are, used, much, more, extensively, to, defend, against, incoming, aircraft, than, interceptors, despite, this, aircraft, today, are, much, more, extensively, used, as, the, primary, tools, for, both, army, and, navy, as, evidenced, by, the, prominent, use, of, helicopters, to, transport, and, support, troops, the, use, of, aerial, bombardment, as, the, first, strike, in, many, engagements, and, the, replacement, of, the, battleship, with, the, aircraft, carrier, as, the, center, of, most, modern, navies, battles, are, usually, named, after, some, feature, of, the, battlefield, geography, such, as, a, town, forest, or, river, commonly, prefixed, battle, of, occasionally, battles, are, named, after, the, date, on, which, they, took, place, such, as, the, glorious, first, of, june, in, the, middle, ages, it, was, considered, important, to, settle, on, a, suitable, name, for, a, battle, which, could, be, used, by, the, chroniclers, after, henry, v, of, england, defeated, a, french, army, on, october, 25, 1415, he, met, with, the, senior, french, herald, and, they, agreed, to, name, the, battle, after, the, nearby, castle, and, so, it, was, called, the, battle, of, agincourt, in, other, cases, the, sides, adopted, different, names, for, the, same, battle, such, as, the, battle, of, gallipoli, which, is, known, in, turkey, as, the, battle, of, anakkale, during, the, american, civil, war, the, union, tended, to, name, the, battles, after, the, nearest, watercourse, such, as, the, battle, of, wilsons, creek, and, the, battle, of, stones, river, whereas, the, confederates, favoured, the, nearby, towns, as, in, the, battles, of, chancellorsville, and, murfreesboro, occasionally, both, names, for, the, same, battle, entered, the, popular, culture, such, as, the, first, battle, of, bull, run, and, the, second, battle, of, bull, run, which, are, also, referred, to, as, the, first, and, second, battles, of, manassas, sometimes, in, desert, warfare, there, is, no, nearby, town, name, to, use, map, coordinates, gave, the, name, to, the, battle, of, 73, easting, in, the, first, gulf, war, some, place, names, have, become, synonymous, with, battles, such, as, the, passchendaele, pearl, harbor, the, alamo, thermopylae, and, waterloo, military, operations, many, of, which, result, in, battle, are, given, codenames, which, are, not, necessarily, meaningful, or, indicative, of, the, type, or, the, location, of, the, battle, operation, market, garden, and, operation, rolling, thunder, are, examples, of, battles, known, by, their, military, codenames, when, a, battleground, is, the, site, of, more, than, one, battle, in, the, same, conflict, the, instances, are, distinguished, by, ordinal, number, such, as, the, first, and, second, battles, of, bull, run, an, extreme, case, are, the, twelve, battles, of, the, isonzo, first, to, twelfth, between, italy, and, austria, hungary, during, the, first, world, war, some, battles, are, named, for, the, convenience, of, military, historians, so, that, periods, of, combat, can, be, neatly, distinguished, from, one, another, following, the, first, world, war, the, british, battles, nomenclature, committee, was, formed, to, decide, on, standard, names, for, all, battles, and, subsidiary, actions, to, the, soldiers, who, did, the, fighting, the, distinction, was, usually, academic, a, soldier, fighting, at, beaumont, hamel, on, november, 13, 1916, was, probably, unaware, he, was, taking, part, in, what, the, committee, named, the, battle, of, the, ancre, many, combats, are, too, small, to, be, battles, terms, such, as, action, affair, skirmish, firefight, raid, or, offensive, patrol, are, used, to, describe, small, military, encounters, these, combats, often, take, place, within, the, time, and, space, of, a, battle, and, while, they, may, have, an, objective, they, are, not, necessarily, decisive, sometimes, the, soldiers, are, unable, to, immediately, gauge, the, significance, of, the, combat, in, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, of, waterloo, some, british, officers, were, in, doubt, as, to, whether, the, day, s, events, merited, the, title, of, battle, or, would, be, called, an, action, battles, affect, the, individuals, who, take, part, as, well, as, the, political, actors, personal, effects, of, battle, range, from, mild, psychological, issues, to, permanent, and, crippling, injuries, some, battle, survivors, have, nightmares, about, the, conditions, they, encountered, or, abnormal, reactions, to, certain, sights, or, sounds, and, some, experience, flashbacks, physical, effects, of, battle, can, include, scars, amputations, lesions, loss, of, bodily, functions, blindness, paralysis, and, death, battles, affect, politics, a, decisive, battle, can, cause, the, losing, side, to, surrender, while, a, pyrrhic, victory, such, as, the, battle, of, asculum, can, cause, the, winning, side, to, reconsider, its, goals, battles, in, civil, wars, have, often, decided, the, fate, of, monarchs, or, political, factions, famous, examples, include, the, wars, of, the, roses, as, well, as, the, jacobite, risings, battles, affect, the, commitment, of, one, side, or, the, other, to, the, continuance, of, a, war, for, example, the, battle, of, inchon, and, the, battle, of, hu, during, the, tet, offensive
