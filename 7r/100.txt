money, is, any, item, or, verifiable, record, that, is, generally, accepted, as, payment, for, goods, and, services, and, repayment, of, debts, such, as, taxes, in, a, particular, country, or, socio, economic, context, the, primary, functions, which, distinguish, money, are, medium, of, exchange, a, unit, of, account, a, store, of, value, and, sometimes, a, standard, of, deferred, payment, money, was, historically, an, emergent, market, phenomenon, that, possessed, intrinsic, value, as, a, commodity, nearly, all, contemporary, money, systems, are, based, on, unbacked, fiat, money, without, use, value, its, value, is, consequently, derived, by, social, convention, having, been, declared, by, a, government, or, regulatory, entity, to, be, legal, tender, that, is, it, must, be, accepted, as, a, form, of, payment, within, the, boundaries, of, the, country, for, all, debts, public, and, private, in, the, case, of, the, united, states, dollar, the, money, supply, of, a, country, comprises, all, currency, in, circulation, banknotes, and, coins, currently, issued, and, depending, on, the, particular, definition, used, one, or, more, types, of, bank, money, the, balances, held, in, checking, accounts, savings, accounts, and, other, types, of, bank, accounts, bank, money, whose, value, exists, on, the, books, of, financial, institutions, and, can, be, converted, into, physical, notes, or, used, for, cashless, payment, forms, by, far, the, largest, part, of, broad, money, in, developed, countries, the, word, money, derives, from, the, latin, word, moneta, with, the, meaning, coin, via, french, monnaie, the, latin, word, is, believed, to, originate, from, a, temple, of, juno, on, capitoline, one, of, rome, s, seven, hills, in, the, ancient, world, juno, was, often, associated, with, money, the, temple, of, juno, moneta, at, rome, was, the, place, where, the, mint, of, ancient, rome, was, located, the, name, juno, may, have, derived, from, the, etruscan, goddess, uni, and, moneta, either, from, the, latin, word, monere, remind, warn, or, instruct, or, the, greek, word, moneres, alone, unique, in, the, western, world, a, prevalent, term, for, coin, money, has, been, specie, stemming, from, latin, in, specie, meaning, in, kind, the, use, of, barter, like, methods, may, date, back, to, at, least, 100, 000, years, ago, though, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, society, or, economy, that, relied, primarily, on, barter, instead, non, monetary, societies, operated, largely, along, the, principles, of, gift, economy, and, debt, when, barter, did, in, fact, occur, it, was, usually, between, either, complete, strangers, or, potential, enemies, many, cultures, around, the, world, eventually, developed, the, use, of, commodity, money, the, mesopotamian, shekel, was, a, unit, of, weight, and, relied, on, the, mass, of, something, like, 160, grains, of, barley, the, first, usage, of, the, term, came, from, mesopotamia, circa, 3000, bc, societies, in, the, americas, asia, africa, and, australia, used, shell, money, often, the, shells, of, the, cowry, cypraea, moneta, l, or, c, annulus, l, according, to, herodotus, the, lydians, were, the, first, people, to, introduce, the, use, of, gold, and, silver, coins, it, is, thought, by, modern, scholars, that, these, first, stamped, coins, were, minted, around, 650, to, 600, bc, the, system, of, commodity, money, eventually, evolved, into, a, system, of, representative, money, this, occurred, because, gold, and, silver, merchants, or, banks, would, issue, receipts, to, their, depositors, redeemable, for, the, commodity, money, deposited, eventually, these, receipts, became, generally, accepted, as, a, means, of, payment, and, were, used, as, money, paper, money, or, banknotes, were, first, used, in, china, during, the, song, dynasty, these, banknotes, known, as, jiaozi, evolved, from, promissory, notes, that, had, been, used, since, the, 7th, century, however, they, did, not, displace, commodity, money, and, were, used, alongside, coins, in, the, 13th, century, paper, money, became, known, in, europe, through, the, accounts, of, travellers, such, as, marco, polo, and, william, of, rubruck, marco, polo, s, account, of, paper, money, during, the, yuan, dynasty, is, the, subject, of, a, chapter, of, his, book, the, travels, of, marco, polo, titled, how, the, great, kaan, causeth, the, bark, of, trees, made, into, something, like, paper, to, pass, for, money, all, over, his, country, banknotes, were, first, issued, in, europe, by, stockholms, banco, in, 1661, and, were, again, also, used, alongside, coins, the, gold, standard, a, monetary, system, where, the, medium, of, exchange, are, paper, notes, that, are, convertible, into, pre, set, fixed, quantities, of, gold, replaced, the, use, of, gold, coins, as, currency, in, the, 17th, 19th, centuries, in, europe, these, gold, standard, notes, were, made, legal, tender, and, redemption, into, gold, coins, was, discouraged, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, almost, all, countries, had, adopted, the, gold, standard, backing, their, legal, tender, notes, with, fixed, amounts, of, gold, after, world, war, ii, and, the, bretton, woods, conference, most, countries, adopted, fiat, currencies, that, were, fixed, to, the, u, s, dollar, the, u, s, dollar, was, in, turn, fixed, to, gold, in, 1971, the, u, s, government, suspended, the, convertibility, of, the, dollar, to, gold, after, this, many, countries, de, pegged, their, currencies, from, the, u, s, dollar, and, most, of, the, world, s, currencies, became, unbacked, by, anything, except, the, governments, fiat, of, legal, tender, and, the, ability, to, convert, the, money, into, goods, via, payment, according, to, proponents, of, modern, money, theory, fiat, money, is, also, backed, by, taxes, by, imposing, taxes, states, create, demand, for, the, currency, they, issue, heterodox, in, money, and, the, mechanism, of, exchange, 1875, william, stanley, jevons, famously, analyzed, money, in, terms, of, four, functions, a, medium, of, exchange, a, common, measure, of, value, or, unit, of, account, a, standard, of, value, or, standard, of, deferred, payment, and, a, store, of, value, by, 1919, jevons, s, four, functions, of, money, were, summarized, in, the, couplet, this, couplet, would, later, become, widely, popular, in, macroeconomics, textbooks, most, modern, textbooks, now, list, only, three, functions, that, of, medium, of, exchange, unit, of, account, and, store, of, value, not, considering, a, standard, of, deferred, payment, as, a, distinguished, function, but, rather, subsuming, it, in, the, others, there, have, been, many, historical, disputes, regarding, the, combination, of, money, s, functions, some, arguing, that, they, need, more, separation, and, that, a, single, unit, is, insufficient, to, deal, with, them, all, one, of, these, arguments, is, that, the, role, of, money, as, a, medium, of, exchange, conflicts, with, its, role, as, a, store, of, value, its, role, as, a, store, of, value, requires, holding, it, without, spending, whereas, its, role, as, a, medium, of, exchange, requires, it, to, circulate, others, argue, that, storing, of, value, is, just, deferral, of, the, exchange, but, does, not, diminish, the, fact, that, money, is, a, medium, of, exchange, that, can, be, transported, both, across, space, and, time, the, term, financial, capital, is, a, more, general, and, inclusive, term, for, all, liquid, instruments, whether, or, not, they, are, a, uniformly, recognized, tender, when, money, is, used, to, intermediate, the, exchange, of, goods, and, services, it, is, performing, a, function, as, a, medium, of, exchange, it, thereby, avoids, the, inefficiencies, of, a, barter, system, such, as, the, inability, to, permanently, ensure, coincidence, of, wants, for, example, between, two, parties, in, a, barter, system, one, party, may, not, have, or, make, the, item, that, the, other, wants, indicating, the, non, existence, of, the, coincidence, of, wants, having, a, medium, of, exchange, can, alleviate, this, issue, because, the, former, can, have, the, freedom, to, spend, time, on, other, items, instead, of, being, burdened, to, only, serve, the, needs, of, the, latter, meanwhile, the, latter, can, use, the, medium, of, exchange, to, seek, for, a, party, that, can, provide, them, with, the, item, they, want, a, unit, of, account, in, economics, is, a, standard, numerical, monetary, unit, of, measurement, of, the, market, value, of, goods, services, and, other, transactions, also, known, as, a, measure, or, standard, of, relative, worth, and, deferred, payment, a, unit, of, account, is, a, necessary, prerequisite, for, the, formulation, of, commercial, agreements, that, involve, debt, money, acts, as, a, standard, measure, and, a, common, denomination, of, trade, it, is, thus, a, basis, for, quoting, and, bargaining, of, prices, it, is, necessary, for, developing, efficient, accounting, systems, like, double, entry, bookkeeping, while, standard, of, deferred, payment, is, distinguished, by, some, texts, particularly, older, ones, other, texts, subsume, this, under, other, functions, a, standard, of, deferred, payment, is, an, accepted, way, to, settle, a, debt, a, unit, in, which, debts, are, denominated, and, the, status, of, money, as, legal, tender, in, those, jurisdictions, which, have, this, concept, states, that, it, may, function, for, the, discharge, of, debts, when, debts, are, denominated, in, money, the, real, value, of, debts, may, change, due, to, inflation, and, deflation, and, for, sovereign, and, international, debts, via, debasement, and, devaluation, to, act, as, a, store, of, value, money, must, be, able, to, be, reliably, saved, stored, and, retrieved, and, be, predictably, usable, as, a, medium, of, exchange, when, it, is, retrieved, the, value, of, the, money, must, also, remain, stable, over, time, some, have, argued, that, inflation, by, reducing, the, value, of, money, diminishes, the, ability, of, the, money, to, function, as, a, store, of, value, the, functions, of, money, are, that, it, is, a, medium, of, exchange, a, unit, of, account, and, a, store, of, value, to, fulfill, these, various, functions, money, must, be, in, economics, money, is, any, financial, instrument, that, can, fulfill, the, functions, of, money, detailed, above, these, financial, instruments, together, are, collectively, referred, to, as, the, money, supply, of, an, economy, in, other, words, the, money, supply, is, the, number, of, financial, instruments, within, a, specific, economy, available, for, purchasing, goods, or, services, since, the, money, supply, consists, of, various, financial, instruments, usually, currency, demand, deposits, and, various, other, types, of, deposits, the, amount, of, money, in, an, economy, is, measured, by, adding, together, these, financial, instruments, creating, a, monetary, aggregate, economists, employ, different, ways, to, measure, the, stock, of, money, or, money, supply, reflected, in, different, types, of, monetary, aggregates, using, a, categorization, system, that, focuses, on, the, liquidity, of, the, financial, instrument, used, as, money, the, most, commonly, used, monetary, aggregates, or, types, of, money, are, conventionally, designated, m1, m2, and, m3, these, are, successively, larger, aggregate, categories, m1, is, currency, coins, and, bills, plus, demand, deposits, such, as, checking, accounts, m2, is, m1, plus, savings, accounts, and, time, deposits, under, 100, 000, m3, is, m2, plus, larger, time, deposits, and, similar, institutional, accounts, m1, includes, only, the, most, liquid, financial, instruments, and, m3, relatively, illiquid, instruments, the, precise, definition, of, m1, m2, etc, may, be, different, in, different, countries, another, measure, of, money, m0, is, also, used, m0, is, base, money, or, the, amount, of, money, actually, issued, by, the, central, bank, of, a, country, it, is, measured, as, currency, plus, deposits, of, banks, and, other, institutions, at, the, central, bank, m0, is, also, the, only, money, that, can, satisfy, the, reserve, requirements, of, commercial, banks, in, current, economic, systems, money, is, created, by, two, procedures, legal, tender, or, narrow, money, m0, is, the, cash, created, by, a, central, bank, by, minting, coins, and, printing, banknotes, bank, money, or, broad, money, m1, m2, is, the, money, created, by, private, banks, through, the, recording, of, loans, as, deposits, of, borrowing, clients, with, partial, support, indicated, by, the, cash, ratio, currently, bank, money, is, created, as, electronic, money, bank, money, whose, value, exists, on, the, books, of, financial, institutions, and, can, be, converted, into, physical, notes, or, used, for, cashless, payment, forms, by, far, the, largest, part, of, broad, money, in, developed, countries, in, most, countries, the, majority, of, money, is, mostly, created, as, m1, m2, by, commercial, banks, making, loans, contrary, to, some, popular, misconceptions, banks, do, not, act, simply, as, intermediaries, lending, out, deposits, that, savers, place, with, them, and, do, not, depend, on, central, bank, money, m0, to, create, new, loans, and, deposits, market, liquidity, describes, how, easily, an, item, can, be, traded, for, another, item, or, into, the, common, currency, within, an, economy, money, is, the, most, liquid, asset, because, it, is, universally, recognized, and, accepted, as, a, common, currency, in, this, way, money, gives, consumers, the, freedom, to, trade, goods, and, services, easily, without, having, to, barter, liquid, financial, instruments, are, easily, tradable, and, have, low, transaction, costs, there, should, be, no, or, minimal, spread, between, the, prices, to, buy, and, sell, the, instrument, being, used, as, money, many, items, have, been, used, as, commodity, money, such, as, naturally, scarce, precious, metals, conch, shells, barley, beads, etc, as, well, as, many, other, things, that, are, thought, of, as, having, value, commodity, money, value, comes, from, the, commodity, out, of, which, it, is, made, the, commodity, itself, constitutes, the, money, and, the, money, is, the, commodity, examples, of, commodities, that, have, been, used, as, mediums, of, exchange, include, gold, silver, copper, rice, wampum, salt, peppercorns, large, stones, decorated, belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc, these, items, were, sometimes, used, in, a, metric, of, perceived, value, in, conjunction, with, one, another, in, various, commodity, valuation, or, price, system, economies, the, use, of, commodity, money, is, similar, to, barter, but, a, commodity, money, provides, a, simple, and, automatic, unit, of, account, for, the, commodity, which, is, being, used, as, money, although, some, gold, coins, such, as, the, krugerrand, are, considered, legal, tender, there, is, no, record, of, their, face, value, on, either, side, of, the, coin, the, rationale, for, this, is, that, emphasis, is, laid, on, their, direct, link, to, the, prevailing, value, of, their, fine, gold, content, american, eagles, are, imprinted, with, their, gold, content, and, legal, tender, face, value, in, 1875, the, british, economist, william, stanley, jevons, described, the, money, used, at, the, time, as, representative, money, representative, money, is, money, that, consists, of, token, coins, paper, money, or, other, physical, tokens, such, as, certificates, that, can, be, reliably, exchanged, for, a, fixed, quantity, of, a, commodity, such, as, gold, or, silver, the, value, of, representative, money, stands, in, direct, and, fixed, relation, to, the, commodity, that, backs, it, while, not, itself, being, composed, of, that, commodity, fiat, money, or, fiat, currency, is, money, whose, value, is, not, derived, from, any, intrinsic, value, or, guarantee, that, it, can, be, converted, into, a, valuable, commodity, such, as, gold, instead, it, has, value, only, by, government, order, fiat, usually, the, government, declares, the, fiat, currency, typically, notes, and, coins, from, a, central, bank, such, as, the, federal, reserve, system, in, the, u, s, to, be, legal, tender, making, it, unlawful, not, to, accept, the, fiat, currency, as, a, means, of, repayment, for, all, debts, public, and, private, some, bullion, coins, such, as, the, australian, gold, nugget, and, american, eagle, are, legal, tender, however, they, trade, based, on, the, market, price, of, the, metal, content, as, a, commodity, rather, than, their, legal, tender, face, value, which, is, usually, only, a, small, fraction, of, their, bullion, value, fiat, money, if, physically, represented, in, the, form, of, currency, paper, or, coins, can, be, accidentally, damaged, or, destroyed, however, fiat, money, has, an, advantage, over, representative, or, commodity, money, in, that, the, same, laws, that, created, the, money, can, also, define, rules, for, its, replacement, in, case, of, damage, or, destruction, for, example, the, u, s, government, will, replace, mutilated, federal, reserve, notes, u, s, fiat, money, if, at, least, half, of, the, physical, note, can, be, reconstructed, or, if, it, can, be, otherwise, proven, to, have, been, destroyed, by, contrast, commodity, money, that, has, been, lost, or, destroyed, cannot, be, recovered, these, factors, led, to, the, shift, of, the, store, of, value, being, the, metal, itself, at, first, silver, then, both, silver, and, gold, and, at, one, point, there, was, bronze, as, well, now, we, have, copper, coins, and, other, non, precious, metals, as, coins, metals, were, mined, weighed, and, stamped, into, coins, this, was, to, assure, the, individual, taking, the, coin, that, he, was, getting, a, certain, known, weight, of, precious, metal, coins, could, be, counterfeited, but, they, also, created, a, new, unit, of, account, which, helped, lead, to, banking, archimedes, principle, provided, the, next, link, coins, could, now, be, easily, tested, for, their, fine, weight, of, the, metal, and, thus, the, value, of, a, coin, could, be, determined, even, if, it, had, been, shaved, debased, or, otherwise, tampered, with, see, numismatics, in, most, major, economies, using, coinage, copper, silver, and, gold, formed, three, tiers, of, coins, gold, coins, were, used, for, large, purchases, payment, of, the, military, and, backing, of, state, activities, silver, coins, were, used, for, midsized, transactions, and, as, a, unit, of, account, for, taxes, dues, contracts, and, fealty, while, copper, coins, represented, the, coinage, of, common, transaction, this, system, had, been, used, in, ancient, india, since, the, time, of, the, mahajanapadas, in, europe, this, system, worked, through, the, medieval, period, because, there, was, virtually, no, new, gold, silver, or, copper, introduced, through, mining, or, conquest, thus, the, overall, ratios, of, the, three, coinages, remained, roughly, equivalent, in, premodern, china, the, need, for, credit, and, for, circulating, a, medium, that, was, less, of, a, burden, than, exchanging, thousands, of, copper, coins, led, to, the, introduction, of, paper, money, this, economic, phenomenon, was, a, slow, and, gradual, process, that, took, place, from, the, late, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, into, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, it, began, as, a, means, for, merchants, to, exchange, heavy, coinage, for, receipts, of, deposit, issued, as, promissory, notes, from, shops, of, wholesalers, notes, that, were, valid, for, temporary, use, in, a, small, regional, territory, in, the, 10th, century, the, song, dynasty, government, began, circulating, these, notes, amongst, the, traders, in, their, monopolized, salt, industry, the, song, government, granted, several, shops, the, sole, right, to, issue, banknotes, and, in, the, early, 12th, century, the, government, finally, took, over, these, shops, to, produce, state, issued, currency, yet, the, banknotes, issued, were, still, regionally, valid, and, temporary, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 13th, century, that, a, standard, and, uniform, government, issue, of, paper, money, was, made, into, an, acceptable, nationwide, currency, the, already, widespread, methods, of, woodblock, printing, and, then, pi, sheng, s, movable, type, printing, by, the, 11th, century, was, the, impetus, for, the, massive, production, of, paper, money, in, premodern, china, at, around, the, same, time, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, a, vigorous, monetary, economy, was, created, during, the, 7th, 12th, centuries, on, the, basis, of, the, expanding, levels, of, circulation, of, a, stable, high, value, currency, the, dinar, innovations, introduced, by, economists, traders, and, merchants, of, the, muslim, world, include, the, earliest, uses, of, credit, cheques, savings, accounts, transactional, accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange, rates, the, transfer, of, credit, and, debt, and, banking, institutions, for, loans, and, deposits, in, europe, paper, money, was, first, introduced, in, sweden, in, 1661, sweden, was, rich, in, copper, thus, because, of, copper, s, low, value, extraordinarily, big, coins, often, weighing, several, kilograms, had, to, be, made, the, advantages, of, paper, currency, were, numerous, it, reduced, transport, of, gold, and, silver, and, thus, lowered, the, risks, it, made, loaning, gold, or, silver, at, interest, easier, since, the, specie, gold, or, silver, never, left, the, possession, of, the, lender, until, someone, else, redeemed, the, note, and, it, allowed, for, a, division, of, currency, into, credit, and, specie, backed, forms, it, enabled, the, sale, of, stock, in, joint, stock, companies, and, the, redemption, of, those, shares, in, the, paper, however, these, advantages, are, held, within, their, disadvantages, first, since, a, note, has, no, intrinsic, value, there, was, nothing, to, stop, issuing, authorities, from, printing, more, of, it, than, they, had, specie, to, back, it, with, second, because, it, increased, the, money, supply, it, increased, inflationary, pressures, a, fact, observed, by, david, hume, in, the, 18th, century, the, result, is, that, paper, money, would, often, lead, to, an, inflationary, bubble, which, could, collapse, if, people, began, demanding, hard, money, causing, the, demand, for, paper, notes, to, fall, to, zero, the, printing, of, paper, money, was, also, associated, with, wars, and, financing, of, wars, and, therefore, regarded, as, part, of, maintaining, a, standing, army, for, these, reasons, paper, currency, was, held, in, suspicion, and, hostility, in, europe, and, america, it, was, also, addictive, since, the, speculative, profits, of, trade, and, capital, creation, were, quite, large, major, nations, established, mints, to, print, money, and, mint, coins, and, branches, of, their, treasury, to, collect, taxes, and, hold, gold, and, silver, stock, at, this, time, both, silver, and, gold, were, considered, legal, tender, and, accepted, by, governments, for, taxes, however, the, instability, in, the, ratio, between, the, two, grew, over, the, 19th, century, with, the, increase, both, in, the, supply, of, these, metals, particularly, silver, and, of, trade, this, is, called, bimetallism, and, the, attempt, to, create, a, bimetallic, standard, where, both, gold, and, silver, backed, currency, remained, in, circulation, occupied, the, efforts, of, inflationists, governments, at, this, point, could, use, currency, as, an, instrument, of, policy, printing, paper, currency, such, as, the, united, states, greenback, to, pay, for, military, expenditures, they, could, also, set, the, terms, at, which, they, would, redeem, notes, for, specie, by, limiting, the, amount, of, purchase, or, the, minimum, amount, that, could, be, redeemed, by, 1900, most, of, the, industrializing, nations, were, on, some, form, of, a, gold, standard, with, paper, notes, and, silver, coins, constituting, the, circulating, medium, private, banks, and, governments, across, the, world, followed, gresham, s, law, keeping, gold, and, silver, paid, but, paying, out, in, notes, this, did, not, happen, all, around, the, world, at, the, same, time, but, occurred, sporadically, generally, in, times, of, war, or, financial, crisis, beginning, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, and, continuing, across, the, world, until, the, late, 20th, century, when, the, regime, of, floating, fiat, currencies, came, into, force, one, of, the, last, countries, to, break, away, from, the, gold, standard, was, the, united, states, in, 1971, no, country, anywhere, in, the, world, today, has, an, enforceable, gold, standard, or, silver, standard, currency, system, commercial, bank, money, or, demand, deposits, are, claims, against, financial, institutions, that, can, be, used, for, the, purchase, of, goods, and, services, a, demand, deposit, account, is, an, account, from, which, funds, can, be, withdrawn, at, any, time, by, check, or, cash, withdrawal, without, giving, the, bank, or, financial, institution, any, prior, notice, banks, have, the, legal, obligation, to, return, funds, held, in, demand, deposits, immediately, upon, demand, or, at, call, demand, deposit, withdrawals, can, be, performed, in, person, via, checks, or, bank, drafts, using, automatic, teller, machines, atms, or, through, online, banking, commercial, bank, money, is, created, by, commercial, banks, whose, reserves, held, as, cash, and, other, highly, liquid, assets, typically, constitute, only, a, fraction, of, their, deposits, while, the, banks, maintain, an, obligation, to, redeem, all, these, deposits, upon, demand, a, practise, known, as, fractional, reserve, banking, commercial, bank, money, differs, from, commodity, and, fiat, money, in, two, ways, firstly, it, is, non, physical, as, its, existence, is, only, reflected, in, the, account, ledgers, of, banks, and, other, financial, institutions, and, secondly, there, is, some, element, of, risk, that, the, claim, will, not, be, fulfilled, if, the, financial, institution, becomes, insolvent, the, money, multiplier, theory, presents, the, process, of, creating, commercial, bank, money, as, a, multiple, greater, than, 1, of, the, amount, of, base, money, created, by, the, country, s, central, bank, the, multiple, itself, being, a, function, of, the, legal, regulation, of, banks, imposed, by, financial, regulators, e, g, potential, reserve, requirements, beside, the, business, policies, of, commercial, banks, and, the, preferences, of, households, factors, which, the, central, bank, can, influence, but, not, control, completely, contemporary, central, banks, generally, do, not, control, the, creation, of, money, nor, do, they, try, to, though, their, interest, rate, setting, monetary, policies, naturally, affect, the, amount, of, loans, and, deposits, that, commercial, banks, create, the, development, of, computer, technology, in, the, second, part, of, the, twentieth, century, allowed, money, to, be, represented, digitally, by, 1990, in, the, united, states, all, money, transferred, between, its, central, bank, and, commercial, banks, was, in, electronic, form, by, the, 2000s, most, money, existed, as, digital, currency, in, bank, databases, in, 2012, by, number, of, transaction, 20, to, 58, percent, of, transactions, were, electronic, dependent, on, country, anonymous, digital, currencies, were, developed, in, the, early, 2000s, early, examples, include, ecash, bit, gold, rpow, and, b, money, not, much, innovation, occurred, until, the, conception, of, bitcoin, in, 2008, which, introduced, the, concept, of, a, decentralised, currency, that, requires, no, trusted, third, party, when, gold, and, silver, were, used, as, money, the, money, supply, could, grow, only, if, the, supply, of, these, metals, was, increased, by, mining, this, rate, of, increase, would, accelerate, during, periods, of, gold, rushes, and, discoveries, such, as, when, columbus, traveled, to, the, new, world, and, brought, back, gold, and, silver, to, spain, or, when, gold, was, discovered, in, california, in, 1848, this, caused, inflation, as, the, value, of, gold, went, down, however, if, the, rate, of, gold, mining, could, not, keep, up, with, the, growth, of, the, economy, gold, became, relatively, more, valuable, and, prices, denominated, in, gold, would, drop, causing, deflation, deflation, was, the, more, typical, situation, for, over, a, century, when, gold, and, paper, money, backed, by, gold, were, used, as, money, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, modern, day, monetary, systems, are, based, on, fiat, money, and, are, no, longer, tied, to, the, value, of, gold, the, amount, of, money, in, the, economy, is, influenced, by, monetary, policy, which, is, the, process, by, which, a, central, bank, influences, the, economy, to, achieve, specific, goals, often, the, goal, of, monetary, policy, is, to, maintain, low, and, stable, inflation, directly, via, an, inflation, targeting, strategy, or, indirectly, via, a, fixed, exchange, rate, system, against, a, major, currency, with, a, stable, inflation, rate, in, some, cases, the, central, bank, may, pursue, various, supplementary, goals, for, example, it, is, clearly, stated, in, the, federal, reserve, act, that, the, board, of, governors, and, the, federal, open, market, committee, should, seek, to, promote, effectively, the, goals, of, maximum, employment, stable, prices, and, moderate, long, term, interest, rates, a, failed, monetary, policy, can, have, significant, detrimental, effects, on, an, economy, and, the, society, that, depends, on, it, these, include, hyperinflation, stagflation, recession, high, unemployment, shortages, of, imported, goods, inability, to, export, goods, and, even, total, monetary, collapse, and, the, adoption, of, a, much, less, efficient, barter, economy, this, happened, in, russia, for, instance, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, monetary, policy, strategies, have, changed, over, time, some, of, the, tools, used, to, conduct, contemporary, monetary, policy, include, in, the, u, s, the, federal, reserve, is, responsible, for, conducting, monetary, policy, while, in, the, eurozone, the, respective, institution, is, the, european, central, bank, other, central, banks, with, a, significant, impact, on, global, finances, are, the, bank, of, japan, people, s, bank, of, china, and, the, bank, of, england, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, monetary, policy, in, several, countries, was, influenced, by, an, economic, theory, known, as, monetarism, monetarism, argued, that, management, of, the, money, supply, should, be, the, primary, means, of, regulating, economic, activity, the, stability, of, the, demand, for, money, prior, to, the, 1980s, was, a, key, finding, of, milton, friedman, and, anna, schwartz, supported, by, the, work, of, david, laidler, and, many, others, it, turned, out, however, that, maintaining, a, monetary, policy, strategy, of, targeting, the, money, supply, did, not, work, very, well, the, relation, between, money, growth, and, inflation, was, not, as, tight, as, expected, by, monetarist, theory, and, the, short, run, relation, between, the, money, supply, and, the, interest, rate, which, is, the, chief, instrument, through, which, the, cental, bank, can, influence, output, and, inflation, was, unreliable, both, problems, were, due, to, unpredictable, shifts, in, the, demand, for, money, consequently, starting, in, the, early, 1990s, a, fundamental, reorientation, took, place, in, most, major, central, banks, starting, to, target, inflation, directly, instead, of, the, money, supply, and, using, the, interest, rate, as, their, main, instrument, the, definition, of, money, says, it, is, money, only, in, a, particular, country, or, socio, economic, context, in, general, communities, only, use, a, single, measure, of, value, which, can, be, identified, in, the, prices, of, goods, listed, for, sale, there, might, be, multiple, media, of, exchange, which, can, be, observed, by, what, is, given, to, purchase, goods, medium, of, exchange, etc, in, most, countries, the, government, acts, to, encourage, a, particular, forms, of, money, such, as, requiring, it, for, taxes, and, punishing, fraud, some, places, do, maintain, two, or, more, currencies, particularly, in, border, towns, or, high, travel, areas, shops, in, these, locations, might, list, prices, and, accept, payment, in, multiple, currencies, otherwise, foreign, currency, is, treated, as, a, financial, asset, in, the, local, market, foreign, currency, is, commonly, bought, or, sold, on, foreign, exchange, markets, by, travelers, and, traders, communities, can, change, the, money, they, use, which, is, known, as, currency, substitution, this, can, happen, intentionally, when, a, government, issues, a, new, currency, for, example, when, brazil, moved, from, the, brazilian, cruzeiro, to, the, brazilian, real, it, can, also, happen, spontaneously, when, the, people, refuse, to, accept, a, currency, experiencing, hyperinflation, even, if, its, use, is, encouraged, by, the, government, the, money, used, by, a, community, can, change, on, a, smaller, scale, this, can, come, through, innovation, such, as, the, adoption, of, cheques, checks, gresham, s, law, says, that, bad, money, drives, out, good, that, is, when, buying, a, good, a, person, is, more, likely, to, pass, on, less, desirable, items, that, qualify, as, money, and, hold, on, to, more, valuable, ones, for, example, coins, with, less, silver, in, them, but, which, are, still, valid, coins, are, more, likely, to, circulate, in, the, community, this, may, effectively, change, the, money, used, by, a, community, the, money, used, by, a, community, does, not, have, to, be, a, currency, issued, by, a, government, a, famous, example, of, community, adopting, a, new, form, of, money, is, prisoners, of, war, using, cigarettes, to, trade, counterfeit, money, is, imitation, currency, produced, without, the, legal, sanction, of, the, state, or, government, producing, or, using, counterfeit, money, is, a, form, of, fraud, or, forgery, counterfeiting, is, almost, as, old, as, money, itself, plated, copies, known, as, fourr, es, have, been, found, of, lydian, coins, which, are, thought, to, be, among, the, first, western, coins, historically, objects, that, were, difficult, to, counterfeit, e, g, shells, rare, stones, precious, metals, were, often, chosen, as, money, before, the, introduction, of, paper, money, the, most, prevalent, method, of, counterfeiting, involved, mixing, base, metals, with, pure, gold, or, silver, a, form, of, counterfeiting, is, the, production, of, documents, by, legitimate, printers, in, response, to, fraudulent, instructions, during, world, war, ii, the, nazis, forged, british, pounds, and, american, dollars, today, some, of, the, finest, counterfeit, banknotes, are, called, superdollars, because, of, their, high, quality, and, likeness, to, the, real, u, s, dollar, there, has, been, significant, counterfeiting, of, euro, banknotes, and, coins, since, the, launch, of, the, currency, in, 2002, but, considerably, less, than, for, the, u, s, dollar, money, laundering, is, the, process, in, which, the, proceeds, of, crime, are, transformed, into, ostensibly, legitimate, money, or, other, assets, however, in, several, legal, and, regulatory, systems, the, term, money, laundering, has, become, conflated, with, other, forms, of, financial, crime, and, sometimes, used, more, generally, to, include, misuse, of, the, financial, system, involving, things, such, as, securities, digital, currencies, credit, cards, and, traditional, currency, including, terrorism, financing, tax, evasion, and, evading, of, international, sanctions
