world, peace, is, the, concept, of, an, ideal, state, of, peace, within, and, among, all, people, and, nations, on, earth, different, cultures, religions, philosophies, and, organizations, have, varying, concepts, on, how, such, a, state, would, come, about, various, religious, and, secular, organizations, have, the, stated, aim, of, achieving, world, peace, through, addressing, human, rights, technology, education, engineering, medicine, or, diplomacy, used, as, an, end, to, all, forms, of, fighting, since, 1945, the, united, nations, and, the, five, permanent, members, of, its, security, council, china, france, russia, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, have, operated, under, the, aim, to, resolve, conflicts, without, war, nonetheless, nations, have, entered, numerous, military, conflicts, since, then, many, theories, as, to, how, world, peace, could, be, achieved, have, been, proposed, several, of, these, are, listed, below, capitalist, or, commercial, peace, forms, one, of, the, three, planks, of, kantian, peace, together, with, democratic, peace, theory, and, institutionalist, arguments, for, peace, although, the, evidence, is, inconclusive, various, scholars, have, argued, for, capitalist, peace, for, instance, in, her, essay, the, roots, of, war, ayn, rand, held, that, the, major, wars, of, history, were, started, by, the, more, controlled, economies, of, the, time, against, the, freer, ones, and, that, capitalism, gave, mankind, the, longest, period, of, peace, in, history, a, period, during, which, there, were, no, wars, involving, the, entire, civilized, world, from, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1815, to, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, with, the, exceptions, of, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, the, spanish, american, war, 1898, and, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, proponents, of, cobdenism, claim, that, by, removing, tariffs, and, creating, international, free, trade, wars, would, become, impossible, because, free, trade, prevents, a, nation, from, becoming, self, sufficient, which, is, a, requirement, for, long, wars, however, free, trade, does, not, prevent, a, nation, from, establishing, some, sort, of, emergency, plan, to, become, temporarily, self, sufficient, in, case, of, war, or, that, a, nation, could, simply, acquire, what, it, needs, from, a, different, nation, a, good, example, of, this, is, world, war, i, during, which, both, britain, and, germany, became, partially, self, sufficient, this, is, particularly, important, because, germany, had, no, plan, for, creating, a, war, economy, proponents, of, democratic, peace, theory, developed, mainly, in, the, 1960s, but, relying, in, part, on, eighteenth, century, kantian, theory, and, frequently, espoused, by, western, politicians, claim, that, strong, empirical, evidence, exists, that, democracies, never, or, rarely, wage, war, against, each, other, however, several, wars, between, democracies, have, taken, place, historically, such, as, the, kargil, war, and, the, cenepa, war, relevant, issues, of, debate, include, whether, sufficient, data, is, available, to, statistically, prove, the, theory, and, whether, peace, results, in, democracy, territorial, peace, theory, or, vice, versa, michael, mousseau, s, economic, norms, theory, links, economic, conditions, with, institutions, of, governance, and, conflict, distinguishing, personal, clientelist, economies, from, impersonal, market, oriented, ones, identifying, the, latter, with, permanent, peace, within, and, between, nations, throughout, most, of, human, history, societies, have, been, based, on, personal, relations, individuals, in, groups, know, each, other, and, exchange, favours, today, in, most, lower, income, societies, hierarchies, of, groups, distribute, wealth, based, on, personal, relationships, among, group, leaders, a, process, often, linked, with, clientelism, and, corruption, michael, mousseau, argues, that, in, this, kind, of, socio, economy, conflict, is, always, present, latent, or, overt, because, individuals, depend, on, their, groups, for, physical, and, economic, security, and, are, thus, loyal, to, their, groups, rather, than, their, states, and, because, groups, are, in, a, constant, state, of, conflict, over, access, to, state, coffers, through, processes, of, bounded, rationality, people, are, conditioned, towards, strong, in, group, identities, and, are, easily, swayed, to, fear, outsiders, psychological, predispositions, that, make, possible, sectarian, violence, genocide, and, terrorism, market, oriented, socio, economics, are, integrated, not, with, personal, ties, but, the, impersonal, force, of, the, market, where, most, individuals, are, economically, dependent, on, trusting, strangers, in, contracts, enforced, by, the, state, this, creates, loyalty, to, a, state, that, enforces, the, rule, of, law, and, contracts, impartially, and, reliably, and, provides, equal, protection, in, the, freedom, to, contract, that, is, liberal, democracy, wars, cannot, happen, within, or, between, nations, with, market, integrated, economies, because, war, requires, the, harming, of, others, and, in, these, kinds, of, economies, everyone, is, always, economically, better, off, when, others, in, the, market, are, also, better, off, not, worse, off, rather, than, fight, citizens, in, market, oriented, socio, economies, care, deeply, about, everyone, s, rights, and, welfare, so, they, demand, economic, growth, at, home, and, economic, cooperation, and, human, rights, abroad, nations, with, market, oriented, socio, economies, tend, to, agree, on, global, issues, and, not, a, single, fatality, has, occurred, in, any, dispute, between, them, economic, norms, theory, should, not, be, confused, with, classical, liberal, theory, the, latter, assumes, that, markets, are, natural, and, that, freer, markets, promote, wealth, in, contrast, economic, norms, theory, shows, how, market, contracting, is, a, learned, norm, and, state, spending, regulation, and, redistribution, are, necessary, to, ensure, that, almost, everyone, can, participate, in, the, social, market, economy, which, is, in, everyone, s, interests, according, to, the, dialectical, materialist, theory, of, karl, marx, humanity, under, capitalism, is, divided, into, just, two, classes, the, proletariat, who, do, not, possess, the, means, of, production, and, the, bourgeoisie, who, do, possess, the, means, of, production, once, the, communist, revolution, occurs, and, consequently, abolishes, the, private, propriety, of, the, means, of, production, humanity, will, not, be, divided, and, the, tension, created, between, these, two, classes, will, cease, mutual, assured, destruction, mad, is, a, doctrine, of, military, strategy, based, on, rational, deterrence, in, which, a, full, scale, use, of, nuclear, weapons, by, two, opposing, sides, would, effectively, result, in, the, destruction, of, both, belligerents, proponents, of, the, policy, of, mad, which, as, a, term, was, coined, in, 1962, during, the, cold, war, attributed, this, to, the, increase, in, the, lethality, of, war, to, the, point, where, it, no, longer, offers, the, possibility, of, a, net, gain, for, either, side, a, form, of, nash, equilibrium, thereby, making, wars, pointless, the, term, is, traced, back, to, the, roman, emperor, hadrian, reigned, ce, 117, 138, but, the, concept, is, older, in, the, indian, epic, ramayana, 7th, to, 4th, centuries, bce, lord, rama, is, quoted, as, saying, bhay, bin, hoye, na, preet, meaning, once, prayers, for, peace, fail, one, may, need, to, instill, fear, to, bring, peace, in, 1943, at, the, peak, of, world, war, ii, the, founder, of, the, paneuropean, union, richard, von, coudenhove, kalergi, argued, that, after, the, war, the, united, states, u, s, was, bound, to, take, command, of, the, skies, to, ensure, the, lasting, world, peace, but, the, inauguration, of, such, a, glorious, century, of, peace, demands, from, us, abandonment, of, old, conceptions, of, peace, the, new, angel, of, peace, must, no, longer, be, pictured, as, a, charming, but, helpless, lady, with, an, olive, branch, in, her, hand, but, like, the, goddess, of, justice, with, a, balance, in, her, left, and, a, sword, in, her, right, or, like, the, archangel, michael, with, a, fiery, sword, and, wings, of, steel, fighting, the, devil, to, restore, and, protect, the, peace, of, heaven, in, fact, near, the, entrance, to,

peace, theory, claim, that, countries, with, stable, borders, are, likely, to, develop, democracy, while, wars, and, territorial, threats, foster, authoritarian, attitudes, and, a, disregard, for, democracy, increasing, attention, has, been, paid, to, the, theory, since, the, early, 2000s, and, it, has, increasingly, informed, democratic, peace, theory, and, been, espoused, in, the, cause, of, peacebuilding, and, international, relations, proponents, of, democratic, peace, theory, counter, argue, that, stable, borders, resulting, from, dispute, arbitration, or, negotiation, rather, than, force, via, autocracy, are, more, likely, to, be, obtained, by, democratic, states, efforts, are, underway, to, synthesize, the, two, theories, after, world, war, ii, the, united, nations, was,

leaders, have, expressed, a, desire, for, an, end, to, violence, the, central, aim, of, the, bah, faith, is, the, establishment, of, the, unity, of, the, peoples, of, the, world, bah, u, ll, h, the, founder, of, the, bah, faith, stated, in, no, uncertain, terms, the, fundamental, purpose, animating, the, faith, of, god, and, his, religion, is, to, safeguard, the, interests, and, promote, the, unity, of, the, human, race, in, his, writings, bah, u, ll, h, described, two, distinct, stages, of, world, peace, a, lesser, peace, and, a, sense, of, most, great, peace, the, lesser, peace, is, essentially, a, collective, security, agreement, between, the, nations, of, the, world, in, this, arrangement, nations, agree, to, protect, one, another, by, rising, up, against, an, aggressor, nation, should, it, seek, the, usurpation, of, territory, or, the, destruction, of, its, neighbors, the, lesser, peace, is, limited, in, scope, and, is, concerned, with, the, establishment, of, basic, order, and, the, universal, recognition, of, national, borders, and, the, sovereignty, of, nations, bah, s, believe, that, the, lesser, peace, is, taking, place, largely, through, the, operation, of, the, divine, will, and, that, bah, influence, on, the, process, is, relatively, minor, the, greatest, peace, is, the, eventual, end, goal, of, the, lesser, peace, and, is, envisioned, as, a, time, of, spiritual, and, social, unity, a, time, when, the, peoples, of, the, world, genuinely, identify, with, and, care, for, one, another, rather, than, simply, tolerating, one, other, s, existence, the, bah, s, view, this, process, as, taking, place, largely, as, a, result, of, the, spread, of, bah, teachings, principles, and, practices, throughout, the, world, the, larger, world, peace, process, and, its, foundational, elements, are, addressed, in, the, document, the, promise, of, world, peace, written, by, the, universal, house, of, justice, many, buddhists, believe, that, world, peace, can, only, be, achieved, if, individuals, establish, peace, within, their, minds, first, the, buddha, s, teachings, emphasize, that, anger, and, other, negative, states, of, mind, are, the, cause, of, wars, and, conflict, buddhists, believe, people, can, live, in, peace, and, harmony, only, if, they, abandon, negative, emotions, such, as, anger, and, cultivate, positive, emotions, such, as, loving, kindness, and, compassion, as, with, all, dharmic, religions, hinduism, jainism, buddhism, and, sikhism, ahimsa, avoidance, of, violence, is, a, central, concept, hatred, is, never, appeased, by, hatred, in, this, world, by, non, hatred, alone, is, hatred, appeased, this, is, a, law, eternal, peace, pagodas, are, monuments, that, are, built, to, symbolize, and, inspire, world, peace, and, have, been, central, to, the, peace, movement, throughout, the, years, these, are, typical, of, buddhist, origin, being, built, by, the, japanese, buddhist, organization, nipponzan, myohoji, they, exist, around, the, world, in, cities, such, as, london, vienna, new, delhi, tokyo, and, lumbini, the, basic, christian, ideal, specifies, that, peace, can, only, come, by, the, word, and, love, of, god, which, is, perfectly, demonstrated, in, the, life, of, christ, peace, i, leave, with, you, my, peace, i, give, you, i, do, not, give, to, you, as, the, world, gives, do, not, let, your, hearts, be, troubled, and, do, not, be, afraid, as, christologically, interpreted, from, isaiah, 2, whereupon, the, word, of, the, lord, is, established, on, the, earth, the, material, human, political, result, will, be, nation, not, taking, up, sword, against, nation, nor, will, they, train, for, war, anymore, christian, world, peace, necessitates, the, living, of, a, proactive, life, replete, with, all, good, works, indirect, light, of, the, word, of, god, the, details, of, such, a, life, can, be, observed, in, the, gospels, especially, the, historically, renowned, sermon, on, the, mount, where, forgiving, those, who, do, wrong, things, against, oneself, is, advocated, among, other, pious, precepts, however, not, all, christians, expect, a, lasting, world, peace, on, this, earth, do, not, suppose, that, i, have, come, to, bring, peace, to, the, earth, i, did, not, come, to, bring, peace, but, a, sword, for, i, have, come, to, turn, a, man, against, his, father, a, daughter, against, her, mother, a, daughter, in, law, against, her, mother, in, law, a, man, s, enemies, will, be, the, members, of, his, own, household, many, christians, believe, that, world, peace, is, expected, to, be, manifest, upon, the, new, earth, that, is, promised, in, christian, scripture, such, as, revelation, 21, the, roman, catholic, religious, conception, of, consecration, of, russia, related, to, the, church, s, high, priority, f, tima, marian, apparitions, promises, a, temporary, world, peace, as, a, result, of, this, process, being, fulfilled, though, before, the, coming, of, the, antichrist, this, period, of, temporary, peace, is, called, the, triumph, of, the, immaculate, heart, pacifist, religious, groups, that, are, related, to, christianity, include, quakers, the, amish, and, mennonites, these, groups, are, known, for, advocating, religious, nonviolence, and, their, adherents, are, often, conscientious, objectors, traditionally, hinduism, has, adopted, an, ancient, sanskrit, phrase, vasudhaiva, kutumbakam, which, translates, as, the, world, is, one, family, the, essence, of, this, concept, is, the, observation, that, only, base, minds, see, dichotomies, and, divisions, the, more, we, seek, wisdom, the, more, we, become, inclusive, and, free, our, internal, spirit, from, worldly, illusions, or, maya, world, peace, is, hence, only, achieved, through, internal, means, by, liberating, ourselves, from, artificial, boundaries, that, separate, us, all, as, with, all, dharmic, religions, hinduism, jainism, buddhism, and, sikhism, ahimsa, avoidance, of, violence, is, a, central, concept, according, to, islamic, eschatology, the, whole, world, will, be, united, under, the, leadership, of, imam, mahdi, at, that, time, love, justice, and, peace, will, be, so, abundant, that, the, world, will, be, in, the, likeness, of, paradise, judaism, is, not, a, pacifist, religion, however, the, concept, of, tikkun, olam, repairing, the, world, is, central, to, modern, rabbinic, judaism, tikkun, olam, is, accomplished, through, various, means, such, as, ritualistically, performing, god, s, commandments, charity, and, social, justice, as, well, as, through, example, persuading, the, rest, of, the, world, to, behave, morally, according, to, some, views, tikkun, olam, would, result, at, the, beginning, of, the, messianic, age, it, has, been, said, that, in, every, generation, a, person, is, born, with, the, potential, to, be, the, spiritual, messiah, if, the, time, is, right, for, the, messianic, age, within, that, person, s, lifetime, then, that, person, will, be, the, mashiach, but, if, that, person, dies, before, he, completes, the, mission, of, the, messiah, then, that, person, is, not, the, messiah, mashiach, specifically, in, jewish, messianism, it, is, considered, that, at, some, future, time, a, messiah, literally, an, anointed, king, appointed, by, god, will, rise, up, to, bring, all, jews, back, to, the, land, of, israel, and, to, establish, god, s, torah, followed, by, everlasting, global, peace, and, prosperity, this, idea, originates, from, passages, in, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, talmud, for, torah, will, go, forth, from, zion, and, the, word, of, hashem, from, jerusalem, and, he, will, judge, between, the, nations, and, decide, disputes, for, many, peoples, and, they, will, beat, their, swords, into, plowshares, and, their, spears, into, pruning, hooks, nation, will, not, lift, the, sword, against, nation, neither, will, they, learn, war, anymore, compassion, for, all, life, human, and, non, human, is, central, to, jainism, they, have, adopted, the, wordings, of, lord, mahavira, jiyo, our, jeeno, do, human, life, is, valued, as, a, unique, rare, opportunity, to, reach, enlightenment, to, kill, any, person, no, matter, what, crime, he, may, have, committed, is, considered, unimaginably, abhorrent, it, is, a, religion, that, requires, monks, and, laity, from, all, its, sects, and, traditions, to, be, vegetarian, some, indian, regions, such, as, gujarat, have, been, strongly, influenced, by, jains, and, often, the, majority, of, the, local, hindus, of, every, denomination, have, also, become, vegetarian, famous, quote, on, world, peace, as, per, jainism, by, a, 19th, century, indian, legend, virchand, gandhi, may, peace, rule, the, universe, may, peace, rule, in, kingdoms, and, empires, may, peace, rule, in, states, and, in, the, lands, of, the, potentates, may, peace, rule, in, the, house, of, friends, and, may, peace, also, rule, in, the, house, of, enemies, as, with, all, dharmic, religions, hinduism, jainism, buddhism, and, sikhism, ahimsa, avoidance, of, violence, is, a, central, concept, the, sikh, religion, preaches, that, peace, comes, from, god, however, pacifism, is, not, absolute, in, sikh, religion, and, sikhs, have, taken, military, action, against, oppression, sikh, people, believe, that, meditation, the, means, of, communicating, with, god, is, unfruitful, without, the, noble, character, of, a, devotee, as, there, can, be, no, worship, without, performing, good, deeds, guru, nanak, stressed, now, kirat, kar, that, a, sikh, should, balance, work,

equal, and, share, the, same, rights, and, women, can, lead, prayers, as, with, all, dharmic, religions, hinduism, jainism, buddhism, and, sikhism, ahimsa, avoidance, of, violence, is, a, central,
