heterodox, in, economics, inflation, is, a, general, increase, in, the, prices, of, goods, and, services, in, an, economy, this, is, usually, measured, using, the, consumer, price, index, cpi, when, the, general, price, level, rises, each, unit, of, currency, buys, fewer, goods, and, services, consequently, inflation, corresponds, to, a, reduction, in, the, purchasing, power, of, money, the, opposite, of, cpi, inflation, is, deflation, a, decrease, in, the, general, price, level, of, goods, and, services, the, common, measure, of, inflation, is, the, inflation, rate, the, annualized, percentage, change, in, a, general, price, index, as, prices, faced, by, households, do, not, all, increase, at, the, same, rate, the, consumer, price, index, cpi, is, often, used, for, this, purpose, changes, in, inflation, are, widely, attributed, to, fluctuations, in, real, demand, for, goods, and, services, also, known, as, demand, shocks, including, changes, in, fiscal, or, monetary, policy, changes, in, available, supplies, such, as, during, energy, crises, also, known, as, supply, shocks, or, changes, in, inflation, expectations, which, may, be, self, fulfilling, moderate, inflation, affects, economies, in, both, positive, and, negative, ways, the, negative, effects, would, include, an, increase, in, the, opportunity, cost, of, holding, money, uncertainty, over, future, inflation, which, may, discourage, investment, and, savings, and, if, inflation, were, rapid, enough, shortages, of, goods, as, consumers, begin, hoarding, out, of, concern, that, prices, will, increase, in, the, future, positive, effects, include, reducing, unemployment, due, to, nominal, wage, rigidity, allowing, the, central, bank, greater, freedom, in, carrying, out, monetary, policy, encouraging, loans, and, investment, instead, of, money, hoarding, and, avoiding, the, inefficiencies, associated, with, deflation, today, some, economists, favour, a, low, and, steady, rate, of, inflation, though, inflation, is, less, popular, with, the, general, public, than, with, economists, since, inflation, simultaneously, transfers, some, of, people, s, income, into, the, hands, of, government, low, as, opposed, to, zero, or, negative, inflation, reduces, the, probability, of, economic, recessions, by, enabling, the, labor, market, to, adjust, more, quickly, in, a, downturn, and, reduces, the, risk, that, a, liquidity, trap, prevents, monetary, policy, from, stabilizing, the, economy, while, avoiding, the, costs, associated, with, high, inflation, the, task, of, keeping, the, rate, of, inflation, low, and, stable, is, usually, given, to, central, banks, that, control, monetary, policy, normally, through, the, setting, of, interest, rates, and, by, carrying, out, open, market, operations, the, term, originates, from, the, latin, inflare, to, blow, into, or, inflate, conceptually, inflation, refers, to, the, general, trend, of, prices, not, changes, in, any, specific, price, for, example, if, people, choose, to, buy, more, cucumbers, than, tomatoes, cucumbers, consequently, become, more, expensive, and, tomatoes, less, expensive, these, changes, are, not, related, to, inflation, they, reflect, a, shift, in, tastes, inflation, is, related, to, the, value, of, currency, itself, when, currency, was, linked, with, gold, if, new, gold, deposits, were, found, the, price, of, gold, and, the, value, of, currency, would, fall, and, consequently, prices, of, all, other, goods, would, become, higher, by, the, nineteenth, century, economists, categorised, three, separate, factors, that, cause, a, rise, or, fall, in, the, price, of, goods, a, change, in, the, value, or, production, costs, of, the, good, a, change, in, the, price, of, money, which, then, was, usually, a, fluctuation, in, the, commodity, price, of, the, metallic, content, in, the, currency, and, currency, depreciation, resulting, from, an, increased, supply, of, currency, relative, to, the, quantity, of, redeemable, metal, backing, the, currency, following, the, proliferation, of, private, banknote, currency, printed, during, the, american, civil, war, the, term, inflation, started, to, appear, as, a, direct, reference, to, the, currency, depreciation, that, occurred, as, the, quantity, of, redeemable, banknotes, outstripped, the, quantity, of, metal, available, for, their, redemption, at, that, time, the, term, inflation, referred, to, the, devaluation, of, the, currency, and, not, to, a, rise, in, the, price, of, goods, this, relationship, between, the, over, supply, of, banknotes, and, a, resulting, depreciation, in, their, value, was, noted, by, earlier, classical, economists, such, as, david, hume, and, david, ricardo, who, would, go, on, to, examine, and, debate, what, effect, a, currency, devaluation, has, on, the, price, of, goods, other, economic, concepts, related, to, inflation, include, deflation, a, fall, in, the, general, price, level, disinflation, a, decrease, in, the, rate, of, inflation, hyperinflation, an, out, of, control, inflationary, spiral, stagflation, a, combination, of, inflation, slow, economic, growth, and, high, unemployment, reflation, an, attempt, to, raise, the, general, level, of, prices, to, counteract, deflationary, pressures, and, asset, price, inflation, a, general, rise, in, the, prices, of, financial, assets, without, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, prices, of, goods, or, services, agflation, an, advanced, increase, in, the, price, for, food, and, industrial, agricultural, crops, when, compared, with, the, general, rise, in, prices, more, specific, forms, of, inflation, refer, to, sectors, whose, prices, vary, semi, independently, from, the, general, trend, house, price, inflation, applies, to, changes, in, the, house, price, index, while, energy, inflation, is, dominated, by, the, costs, of, oil, and, gas, inflation, has, been, a, feature, of, history, during, the, entire, period, when, money, has, been, used, as, a, means, of, payment, one, of, the, earliest, documented, inflations, occurred, in, alexander, the, great, s, empire, 330, bce, historically, when, commodity, money, was, used, periods, of, inflation, and, deflation, would, alternate, depending, on, the, condition, of, the, economy, however, when, large, prolonged, infusions, of, gold, or, silver, into, an, economy, occurred, this, could, lead, to, long, periods, of, inflation, the, adoption, of, fiat, currency, by, many, countries, from, the, 18th, century, onwards, made, much, larger, variations, in, the, supply, of, money, possible, rapid, increases, in, the, money, supply, have, taken, place, a, number, of, times, in, countries, experiencing, political, crises, producing, hyperinflations, episodes, of, extreme, inflation, rates, much, higher, than, those, observed, in, earlier, periods, of, commodity, money, the, hyperinflation, in, the, weimar, republic, of, germany, is, a, notable, example, the, hyperinflation, in, venezuela, is, the, highest, in, the, world, with, an, annual, inflation, rate, of, 833, 997, as, of, october, 2018, historically, inflations, of, varying, magnitudes, have, occurred, interspersed, with, corresponding, deflationary, periods, from, the, price, revolution, of, the, 16th, century, which, was, driven, by, the, flood, of, gold, and, particularly, silver, seized, and, mined, by, the, spaniards, in, latin, america, to, the, largest, paper, money, inflation, of, all, time, in, hungary, after, world, war, ii, however, since, the, 1980s, inflation, has, been, held, low, and, stable, in, countries, with, independent, central, banks, this, has, led, to, a, moderation, of, the, business, cycle, and, a, reduction, in, variation, in, most, macroeconomic, indicators, an, event, known, as, the, great, moderation, alexander, the, great, s, conquest, of, the, persian, empire, in, 330, bce, was, followed, by, one, of, the, earliest, documented, inflation, periods, in, the, ancient, world, rapid, increases, in, the, quantity, of, money, or, in, the, overall, money, supply, have, occurred, in, many, different, societies, throughout, history, changing, with, different, forms, of, money, used, for, instance, when, silver, was, used, as, currency, the, government, could, collect, silver, coins, melt, them, down, mix, them, with, other, less, valuable, metals, such, as, copper, or, lead, and, reissue, them, at, the, same, nominal, value, a, process, known, as, debasement, at, the, ascent, of, nero, as, roman, emperor, in, ad, 54, the, denarius, contained, more, than, 90, silver, but, by, the, 270s, hardly, any, silver, was, left, by, diluting, the, silver, with, other, metals, the, government, could, issue, more, coins, without, increasing, the, amount, of, silver, used, to, make, them, when, the, cost, of, each, coin, is, lowered, in, this, way, the, government, profits, from, an, increase, in, seigniorage, this, practice, would, increase, the, money, supply, but, at, the, same, time, the, relative, value, of, each, coin, would, be, lowered, as, the, relative, value, of, the, coins, becomes, lower, consumers, would, need, to, give, more, coins, in, exchange, for, the, same, goods, and, services, as, before, these, goods, and, services, would, experience, a, price, increase, as, the, value, of, each, coin, is, reduced, again, at, the, end, of, the, third, century, ce, during, the, reign, of, diocletian, the, roman, empire, experienced, rapid, inflation, song, dynasty, china, introduced, the, practice, of, printing, paper, money, to, create, fiat, currency, during, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty, the, government, spent, a, great, deal, of, money, fighting, costly, wars, and, reacted, by, printing, more, money, leading, to, inflation, fearing, the, inflation, that, plagued, the, yuan, dynasty, the, ming, dynasty, initially, rejected, the, use, of, paper, money, and, reverted, to, using, copper, coins, during, the, malian, king, mansa, musa, s, hajj, to, mecca, in, 1324, he, was, reportedly, accompanied, by, a, camel, train, that, included, thousands, of, people, and, nearly, a, hundred, camels, when, he, passed, through, cairo, he, spent, or, gave, away, so, much, gold, that, it, depressed, its, price, in, egypt, for, over, a, decade, reducing, its, purchasing, power, a, contemporary, arab, historian, remarked, about, mansa, musa, s, visit, gold, was, at, a, high, price, in, egypt, until, they, came, in, that, year, the, mithqal, did, not, go, below, 25, dirhams, and, was, generally, above, but, from, that, time, its, value, fell, and, it, cheapened, in, price, and, has, remained, cheap, till, now, the, mithqal, does, not, exceed, 22, dirhams, or, less, this, has, been, the, state, of, affairs, for, about, twelve, years, until, this, day, by, reason, of, the, large, amount, of, gold, which, they, brought, into, egypt, and, spent, there, there, is, no, reliable, evidence, of, inflation, in, europe, for, the, thousand, years, that, followed, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, but, from, the, middle, ages, onwards, reliable, data, do, exist, mostly, the, medieval, inflation, episodes, were, modest, and, there, was, a, tendency, that, inflationary, periods, were, followed, by, deflationary, periods, from, the, second, half, of, the, 15th, century, to, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, western, europe, experienced, a, major, inflationary, cycle, referred, to, as, the, price, revolution, with, prices, on, average, rising, perhaps, sixfold, over, 150, years, this, is, often, attributed, to, the, influx, of, gold, and, silver, from, the, new, world, into, habsburg, spain, with, wider, availability, of, silver, in, previously, cash, starved, europe, causing, widespread, inflation, european, population, rebound, from, the, black, death, began, before, the, arrival, of, new, world, metal, and, may, have, begun, a, process, of, inflation, that, new, world, silver, compounded, later, in, the, 16th, century, a, pattern, of, intermittent, inflation, and, deflation, periods, persisted, for, centuries, until, the, great, depression, in, the, 1930s, which, was, characterized, by, major, deflation, since, the, great, depression, however, there, has, been, a, general, tendency, for, prices, to, rise, every, year, in, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, annual, inflation, in, most, industrialized, countries, reached, two, digits, ten, percent, or, more, the, double, digit, inflation, era, was, of, short, duration, however, inflation, by, the, mid, 1980s, returned, to, more, modest, levels, amid, this, general, trends, there, have, been, spectacular, high, inflation, episodes, in, individual, countries, in, interwar, europe, towards, the, end, of, the, nationalist, chinese, government, in, 1948, 1949, and, later, in, some, latin, american, countries, in, israel, and, in, zimbabwe, some, of, these, episodes, are, considered, hyperinflation, periods, normally, designating, inflation, rates, that, surpass, 50, percent, monthly, given, that, there, are, many, possible, measures, of, the, price, level, there, are, many, possible, measures, of, price, inflation, most, frequently, the, term, inflation, refers, to, a, rise, in, a, broad, price, index, representing, the, overall, price, level, for, goods, and, services, in, the, economy, the, consumer, price, index, cpi, the, personal, consumption, expenditures, price, index, pcepi, and, the, gdp, deflator, are, some, examples, of, broad, price, indices, however, inflation, may, also, be, used, to, describe, a, rising, price, level, within, a, narrower, set, of, assets, goods, or, services, within, the, economy, such, as, commodities, including, food, fuel, metals, tangible, assets, such, as, real, estate, services, such, as, entertainment, and, health, care, or, labor, although, the, values, of, capital, assets, are, often, casually, said, to, inflate, this, should, not, be, confused, with, inflation, as, a, defined, term, a, more, accurate, description, for, an, increase, in, the, value, of, a, capital, asset, is, appreciation, the, fbi, cci, the, producer, price, index, and, employment, cost, index, eci, are, examples, of, narrow, price, indices, used, to, measure, price, inflation, in, particular, sectors, of, the, economy, core, inflation, is, a, measure, of, inflation, for, a, subset, of, consumer, prices, that, excludes, food, and, energy, prices, which, rise, and, fall, more, than, other, prices, in, the, short, term, the, federal, reserve, board, pays, particular, attention, to, the, core, inflation, rate, to, get, a, better, estimate, of, long, term, future, inflation, trends, overall, the, inflation, rate, is, most, widely, calculated, by, determining, the, movement, or, change, in, a, price, index, typically, the, consumer, price, index, the, inflation, rate, is, the, percentage, change, of, a, price, index, over, time, the, retail, prices, index, is, also, a, measure, of, inflation, that, is, commonly, used, in, the, united, kingdom, it, is, broader, than, the, cpi, and, contains, a, larger, basket, of, goods, and, services, the, rpi, is, indicative, of, the, experiences, of, a, wide, range, of, household, types, particularly, low, income, households, to, illustrate, the, method, of, calculation, in, january, 2007, the, u, s, consumer, price, index, was, 202, 416, and, in, january, 2008, it, was, 211, 080, the, formula, for, calculating, the, annual, percentage, rate, inflation, in, the, cpi, over, the, course, of, the, year, is, 211, 080, 202, 416, 202, 416, 100, 4, 28, displaystyle, left, frac, 211, 080, 202, 416, 202, 416, right, times, 100, 4, 28, the, resulting, inflation, rate, for, the, cpi, in, this, one, year, period, is, 4, 28, meaning, the, general, level, of, prices, for, typical, u, s, consumers, rose, by, approximately, four, percent, in, 2007, other, widely, used, price, indices, for, calculating, price, inflation, include, the, following, other, common, measures, of, inflation, are, gdp, deflator, nominal, gdp, real, gdp, displaystyle, mbox, gdp, deflator, frac, mbox, nominal, gdp, mbox, real, gdp, in, some, cases, the, measures, are, meant, to, be, more, humorous, or, to, reflect, a, single, place, this, includes, measuring, inflation, in, an, economy, requires, objective, means, of, differentiating, changes, in, nominal, prices, on, a, common, set, of, goods, and, services, and, distinguishing, them, from, those, price, shifts, resulting, from, changes, in, value, such, as, volume, quality, or, performance, for, example, if, the, price, of, a, can, of, corn, changes, from, 0, 90, to, 1, 00, over, the, course, of, a, year, with, no, change, in, quality, then, this, price, difference, represents, inflation, this, single, price, change, would, not, however, represent, general, inflation, in, an, overall, economy, overall, inflation, is, measured, as, the, price, change, of, a, large, basket, of, representative, goods, and, services, this, is, the, purpose, of, a, price, index, which, is, the, combined, price, of, a, basket, of, many, goods, and, services, the, combined, price, is, the, sum, of, the, weighted, prices, of, items, in, the, basket, a, weighted, price, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, unit, price, of, an, item, by, the, number, of, that, item, the, average, consumer, purchases, weighted, pricing, is, necessary, to, measure, the, effect, of, individual, unit, price, changes, on, the, economy, s, overall, inflation, the, consumer, price, index, for, example, uses, data, collected, by, surveying, households, to, determine, what, proportion, of, the, typical, consumer, s, overall, spending, is, spent, on, specific, goods, and, services, and, weights, the, average, prices, of, those, items, accordingly, those, weighted, average, prices, are, combined, to, calculate, the, overall, price, to, better, relate, price, changes, over, time, indexes, typically, choose, a, base, year, price, and, assign, it, a, value, of, 100, index, prices, in, subsequent, years, are, then, expressed, in, relation, to, the, base, year, price, while, comparing, inflation, measures, for, various, periods, one, has, to, take, into, consideration, the, base, effect, as, well, inflation, measures, are, often, modified, over, time, either, for, the, relative, weight, of, goods, in, the, basket, or, in, the, way, in, which, goods, and, services, from, the, present, are, compared, with, goods, and, services, from, the, past, basket, weights, are, updated, regularly, usually, every, year, to, adapt, to, changes, in, consumer, behavior, sudden, changes, in, consumer, behavior, can, still, introduce, a, weighting, bias, in, inflation, measurement, for, example, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, it, has, been, shown, that, the, basket, of, goods, and, services, was, no, longer, representative, of, consumption, during, the, crisis, as, numerous, goods, and, services, could, no, longer, be, consumed, due, to, government, containment, measures, lock, downs, over, time, adjustments, are, also, made, to, the, type, of, goods, and, services, selected, to, reflect, changes, in, the, sorts, of, goods, and, services, purchased, by, typical, consumers, new, products, may, be, introduced, older, products, disappear, the, quality, of, existing, products, may, change, and, consumer, preferences, can, shift, different, segments, of, the, population, may, naturally, consume, different, baskets, of, goods, and, services, and, may, even, experience, different, inflation, rates, it, is, argued, that, companies, have, put, more, innovation, into, bringing, down, prices, for, wealthy, families, than, for, poor, families, inflation, numbers, are, often, seasonally, adjusted, to, differentiate, expected, cyclical, cost, shifts, for, example, home, heating, costs, are, expected, to, rise, in, colder, months, and, seasonal, adjustments, are, often, used, when, measuring, inflation, to, compensate, for, cyclical, energy, or, fuel, demand, spikes, inflation, numbers, may, be, averaged, or, otherwise, subjected, to, statistical, techniques, to, remove, statistical, noise, and, volatility, of, individual, prices, when, looking, at, inflation, economic, institutions, may, focus, only, on, certain, kinds, of, prices, or, special, indices, such, as, the, core, inflation, index, which, is, used, by, central, banks, to, formulate, monetary, policy, most, inflation, indices, are, calculated, from, weighted, averages, of, selected, price, changes, this, necessarily, introduces, distortion, and, can, lead, to, legitimate, disputes, about, what, the, true, inflation, rate, is, this, problem, can, be, overcome, by, including, all, available, price, changes, in, the, calculation, and, then, choosing, the, median, value, in, some, other, cases, governments, may, intentionally, report, false, inflation, rates, for, instance, during, the, presidency, of, cristina, kirchner, 2007, 2015, the, government, of, argentina, was, criticised, for, manipulating, economic, data, such, as, inflation, and, gdp, figures, for, political, gain, and, to, reduce, payments, on, its, inflation, indexed, debt, the, true, inflation, is, one, percentage, point, lower, than, the, official, one, according, to, research, therefore, the, 2, inflation, target, is, needed, to, prevent, the, true, inflation, being, close, to, zero, or, even, deflation, the, reasons, are, the, following, nevertheless, people, overestimate, the, inflation, even, vs, the, measured, inflation, this, is, because, they, focus, more, on, commonly, bought, items, than, on, durable, goods, and, more, on, price, increases, than, on, price, decreases, on, the, other, hand, different, people, have, different, shopping, baskets, and, hence, face, different, inflation, rates, inflation, expectations, or, expected, inflation, is, the, rate, of, inflation, that, is, anticipated, for, some, time, in, the, foreseeable, future, there, are, two, major, approaches, to, modeling, the, formation, of, inflation, expectations, adaptive, expectations, models, them, as, a, weighted, average, of, what, was, expected, one, period, earlier, and, the, actual, rate, of, inflation, that, most, recently, occurred, rational, expectations, models, them, as, unbiased, in, the, sense, that, the, expected, inflation, rate, is, not, systematically, above, or, systematically, below, the, inflation, rate, that, actually, occurs, a, long, standing, survey, of, inflation, expectations, is, the, university, of, michigan, survey, inflation, expectations, affect, the, economy, in, several, ways, they, are, more, or, less, built, into, nominal, interest, rates, so, that, a, rise, or, fall, in, the, expected, inflation, rate, will, typically, result, in, a, rise, or, fall, in, nominal, interest, rates, giving, a, smaller, effect, if, any, on, real, interest, rates, in, addition, higher, expected, inflation, tends, to, be, built, into, the, rate, of, wage, increases, giving, a, smaller, effect, if, any, on, the, changes, in, real, wages, moreover, the, response, of, inflationary, expectations, to, monetary, policy, can, influence, the, division, of, the, effects, of, policy, between, inflation, and, unemployment, see, monetary, policy, credibility, theories, of, the, origin, and, causes, of, inflation, have, existed, since, at, least, the, 16th, century, two, competing, theories, the, quantity, theory, of, money, and, the, real, bills, doctrine, appeared, in, various, disguises, during, century, long, debates, on, recommended, central, bank, behaviour, in, the, 20th, century, keynesian, monetarist, and, new, classical, also, known, as, rational, expectations, views, on, inflation, dominated, post, world, war, ii, macroeconomics, discussions, which, were, often, heated, intellectual, debates, until, some, kind, of, synthesis, of, the, various, theories, was, reached, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, price, revolution, from, ca, 1550, 1700, caused, several, thinkers, to, present, what, is, now, considered, to, be, early, formulations, of, the, quantity, theory, of, money, qtm, other, contemporary, authors, attributed, rising, price, levels, to, the, debasement, of, national, coinages, later, research, has, shown, that, also, growing, output, of, central, european, silver, mines, and, an, increase, in, the, velocity, of, money, because, of, innovations, in, the, payment, technology, in, particular, the, increased, use, of, bills, of, exchange, contributed, to, the, price, revolution, an, alternative, theory, the, real, bills, doctrine, rbd, originated, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, receiving, its, first, authoritative, exposition, in, adam, smith, s, the, wealth, of, nations, it, asserts, that, banks, should, issue, their, money, in, exchange, for, short, term, real, bills, of, adequate, value, as, long, as, banks, only, issue, a, dollar, in, exchange, for, assets, worth, at, least, a, dollar, the, issuing, bank, s, assets, will, naturally, move, in, step, with, its, issuance, of, money, and, the, money, will, hold, its, value, should, the, bank, fail, to, get, or, maintain, assets, of, adequate, value, then, the, bank, s, money, will, lose, value, just, as, any, financial, security, will, lose, value, if, its, asset, backing, diminishes, the, real, bills, doctrine, also, known, as, the, backing, theory, thus, asserts, that, inflation, results, when, money, outruns, its, issuer, s, assets, the, quantity, theory, of, money, in, contrast, claims, that, inflation, results, when, money, outruns, the, economy, s, production, of, goods, during, the, 19th, century, three, different, schools, debated, these, questions, the, british, currency, school, upheld, a, quantity, theory, view, believing, that, the, bank, of, england, s, issues, of, bank, notes, should, vary, one, for, one, with, the, bank, s, gold, reserves, in, contrast, to, this, the, british, banking, school, followed, the, real, bills, doctrine, recommending, that, the, bank, s, operations, should, be, governed, by, the, needs, of, trade, banks, should, be, able, to, issue, currency, against, bills, of, trading, i, e, real, bills, that, they, buy, from, merchants, a, third, group, the, free, banking, school, held, that, competitive, private, banks, would, not, overissue, even, though, a, monopolist, central, bank, could, be, believed, to, do, it, the, debate, between, currency, or, quantity, theory, and, banking, schools, during, the, 19th, century, prefigures, current, questions, about, the, credibility, of, money, in, the, present, in, the, 19th, century, the, banking, schools, had, greater, influence, in, policy, in, the, united, states, and, great, britain, while, the, currency, schools, had, more, influence, on, the, continent, that, is, in, non, british, countries, particularly, in, the, latin, monetary, union, and, the, scandinavian, monetary, union, during, the, bullionist, controversy, during, the, napoleonic, wars, david, ricardo, argued, that, the, bank, of, england, had, engaged, in, over, issue, of, bank, notes, leading, to, commodity, price, increases, in, the, late, 19th, century, supporters, of, the, quantity, theory, of, money, led, by, irving, fisher, debated, with, supporters, of, bimetallism, later, knut, wicksell, sought, to, explain, price, movements, as, the, result, of, real, shocks, rather, than, movements, in, money, supply, resounding, statements, from, the, real, bills, doctrine, in, 2019, monetary, historians, thomas, m, humphrey, and, richard, timberlake, published, gold, the, real, bills, doctrine, and, the, fed, sources, of, monetary, disorder, 1922, 1938, john, maynard, keynes, in, his, 1936, main, work, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, emphasized, that, wages, and, prices, were, sticky, in, the, short, run, but, gradually, responded, to, aggregate, demand, shocks, these, could, arise, from, many, different, sources, e, g, autonomous, movements, in, investment, or, fluctuations, in, private, wealth, or, interest, rates, economic, policy, could, also, affect, demand, monetary, policy, by, affecting, interest, rates, and, fiscal, policy, either, directly, through, the, level, of, government, final, consumption, expenditure, or, indirectly, by, changing, disposable, income, via, tax, changes, the, various, sources, of, variations, in, aggregate, demand, will, cause, cycles, in, both, output, and, price, levels, initially, a, demand, change, will, primarily, affect, output, because, of, the, price, stickiness, but, eventually, prices, and, wages, will, adjust, to, reflect, the, change, in, demand, consequently, movements, in, real, output, and, prices, will, be, positively, but, not, strongly, correlated, keynes, propositions, formed, the, basis, of, keynesian, economics, which, came, to, dominate, macroeconomic, research, and, economic, policy, in, the, first, decades, after, world, war, ii, 526, other, keynesian, economists, developed, and, reformed, several, of, keynes, ideas, importantly, alban, william, phillips, in, 1958, published, indirect, evidence, of, a, negative, relation, between, inflation, and, unemployment, confirming, the, keynesian, emphasis, on, a, positive, correlation, between, increases, in, real, output, normally, accompanied, by, a, fall, in, unemployment, and, rising, prices, i, e, inflation, phillips, findings, were, confirmed, by, other, empirical, analyses, and, became, known, as, a, phillips, curve, it, quickly, became, central, to, macroeconomic, thinking, apparently, offering, a, stable, trade, off, between, price, stability, and, employment, the, curve, was, interpreted, to, imply, that, a, country, could, achieve, low, unemployment, if, it, were, willing, to, tolerate, a, higher, inflation, rate, or, vice, versa, 173, the, phillips, curve, model, described, the, u, s, experience, well, in, the, 1960s, but, failed, to, describe, the, stagflation, experienced, in, the, 1970s, during, the, 1960s, the, keynesian, view, of, inflation, and, macroeconomic, policy, altogether, were, challenged, by, monetarist, theories, led, by, milton, friedman, 528, 529, friedman, famously, stated, that, inflation, is, always, and, everywhere, a, monetary, phenomenon, he, revived, the, quantity, theory, of, money, by, irving, fisher, and, others, making, it, into, a, central, tenet, of, monetarist, thinking, arguing, that, the, most, significant, factor, influencing, inflation, or, deflation, is, how, fast, the, money, supply, grows, or, shrinks, the, quantity, theory, of, money, simply, stated, says, that, any, change, in, the, amount, of, money, in, a, system, will, change, the, price, level, this, theory, begins, with, the, equation, of, exchange, where, in, this, formula, the, general, price, level, is, related, to, the, level, of, real, economic, activity, q, the, quantity, of, money, m, and, the, velocity, of, money, v, the, formula, itself, is, simply, an, uncontroversial, accounting, identity, because, the, velocity, of, money, v, is, defined, residually, from, the, equation, to, be, the, ratio, of, final, nominal, expenditure, p, q, displaystyle, pq, to, the, quantity, of, money, m, 99, monetarists, assumed, additionally, that, the, velocity, of, money, is, unaffected, by, monetary, policy, at, least, in, the, long, run, that, the, real, value, of, output, is, also, exogenous, in, the, long, run, its, long, run, value, being, determined, independently, by, the, productive, capacity, of, the, economy, and, that, money, supply, is, exogenous, and, can, be, controlled, by, the, monetary, authorities, under, these, assumptions, the, primary, driver, of, the, change, in, the, general, price, level, is, changes, in, the, quantity, of, money, consequently, monetarists, contended, that, monetary, policy, not, fiscal, policy, was, the, most, potent, instrument, to, influence, aggregate, demand, real, output, and, eventually, inflation, this, was, contrary, to, keynesian, thinking, which, in, principle, recognized, a, role, for, monetary, policy, but, in, practice, believed, that, the, effect, from, interest, rate, changes, to, the, real, economy, was, slight, making, monetary, policy, an, ineffective, instrument, preferring, fiscal, policy, 528, conversely, monetarists, considered, fiscal, policy, or, government, spending, and, taxation, as, ineffective, in, controlling, inflation, friedman, also, took, issue, with, the, traditional, keynesian, view, concerning, the, phillips, curve, he, together, with, edmund, phelps, contended, that, the, trade, off, between, inflation, and, unemployment, implied, by, the, phillips, curve, was, only, temporary, but, not, permanent, if, politicians, tried, to, exploit, it, it, would, eventually, disappear, because, higher, inflation, would, over, time, be, built, into, the, economic, expectations, of, households, and, firms, 528, 529, this, line, of, thinking, led, to, the, concept, of, potential, output, sometimes, called, the, natural, gross, domestic, product, a, level, of, gdp, where, the, economy, is, stable, in, the, sense, that, inflation, will, neither, decrease, nor, increase, this, level, may, itself, change, over, time, when, institutional, or, natural, constraints, change, it, corresponds, to, the, non, accelerating, inflation, rate, of, unemployment, nairu, or, the, natural, rate, of, unemployment, sometimes, called, the, structural, level, of, unemployment, if, gdp, exceeds, its, potential, and, unemployment, consequently, is, below, the, nairu, the, theory, says, that, inflation, will, accelerate, as, suppliers, increase, their, prices, if, gdp, falls, below, its, potential, level, and, unemployment, is, above, the, nairu, inflation, will, decelerate, as, suppliers, attempt, to, fill, excess, capacity, cutting, prices, and, undermining, inflation, in, the, early, 1970s, rational, expectations, theory, led, by, economists, like, robert, lucas, thomas, sargent, and, robert, barro, transformed, macroeconomic, thinking, radically, they, held, that, economic, actors, look, rationally, into, the, future, when, trying, to, maximize, their, well, being, and, do, not, respond, solely, to, immediate, opportunity, costs, and, pressures, 529, 530, in, this, view, future, expectations, and, strategies, are, important, for, inflation, as, well, one, implication, was, that, agents, would, anticipate, the, likely, behaviour, of, central, banks, and, base, their, own, actions, on, these, expectations, a, central, bank, having, a, reputation, of, being, soft, on, inflation, will, generate, high, inflation, expectations, which, again, will, be, self, fulfilling, when, all, agents, build, expectations, of, future, high, inflation, into, their, nominal, contracts, like, wage, agreements, on, the, other, hand, if, the, central, bank, has, a, reputation, of, being, tough, on, inflation, then, such, a, policy, announcement, will, be, believed, and, inflationary, expectations, will, come, down, rapidly, thus, allowing, inflation, itself, to, come, down, rapidly, with, minimal, economic, disruption, the, implication, is, that, credibility, becomes, very, important, for, central, banks, in, fighting, inflation, 467, 469, events, during, the, 1970s, proved, milton, friedman, and, other, critics, of, the, traditional, phillips, curve, right, the, relation, between, the, inflation, rate, and, the, unemployment, rate, broke, down, eventually, a, consensus, was, established, that, the, break, down, was, due, to, agents, changing, their, inflation, expectations, confirming, friedman, s, theory, as, a, consequence, the, notion, of, a, natural, rate, of, unemployment, alternatively, called, the, structural, rate, of, unemployment, was, accepted, by, most, economists, meaning, that, there, is, a, specific, level, of, unemployment, that, is, compatible, with, stable, inflation, stabilization, policy, must, therefore, try, to, steer, economic, activity, so, that, the, actual, unemployment, rate, converges, towards, that, level, 176, 189, the, trade, off, between, the, unemployment, rate, and, inflation, implied, by, phillips, thus, holds, in, the, short, term, but, not, in, the, long, term, also, the, oil, crises, of, the, 1970s, causing, at, the, same, time, rising, unemployment, and, rising, inflation, i, e, stagflation, led, to, a, broad, recognition, by, economists, that, supply, shocks, could, independently, affect, inflation, 529, during, the, 1980s, a, group, of, researchers, named, new, keynesians, emerged, who, accepted, many, originally, non, keynesian, concepts, like, the, importance, of, monetary, policy, the, existence, of, a, natural, level, of, unemployment, and, the, incorporation, of, rational, expectations, formation, as, a, reasonable, benchmark, at, the, same, time, they, believed, like, keynes, did, that, various, market, imperfections, in, different, markets, like, labour, markets, and, financial, markets, were, also, important, to, study, to, understand, both, inflation, generation, and, business, cycles, 533, 534, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, there, were, often, heated, intellectual, debates, between, new, keynesians, and, new, classicals, but, by, the, 2000s, a, synthesis, gradually, emerged, the, result, has, been, called, the, new, keynesian, model, 535, the, new, neoclassical, synthesis, or, simply, the, new, consensus, model, a, common, view, beginning, around, the, year, 2000, and, holding, through, to, the, present, time, on, inflation, and, its, causes, can, be, illustrated, by, a, modern, phillips, curve, including, a, role, for, supply, shocks, and, inflation, expectations, beside, the, original, role, of, aggregate, demand, determining, employment, and, unemployment, fluctuations, in, influencing, the, inflation, rate, consequently, demand, shocks, supply, shocks, and, inflation, expectations, are, all, potentially, important, determinants, of, inflation, confirming, the, basis, of, the, older, triangle, model, by, robert, j, gordon, the, important, role, of, rational, expectations, is, recognized, by, the, emphasis, on, credibility, on, the, part, of, central, banks, and, other, policy, makers, the, monetarist, assertion, that, monetary, policy, alone, could, successfully, control, inflation, formed, part, of, the, new, consensus, which, recognized, that, both, monetary, and, fiscal, policy, are, important, tools, for, influencing, aggregate, demand, 528, indeed, monetary, policy, is, under, normal, circumstances, considered, to, be, the, preferable, instrument, to, contain, inflation, at, the, same, time, most, central, banks, have, abandoned, trying, to, target, money, growth, as, originally, advocated, by, the, monetarists, instead, most, central, banks, in, developed, countries, focus, on, adjusting, interest, rates, to, achieve, an, explicit, inflation, target, 505, 509, the, reason, for, central, bank, reluctance, in, following, money, growth, targets, is, that, the, money, stock, measures, that, central, banks, can, control, tightly, e, g, the, monetary, base, are, not, very, closely, linked, to, aggregate, demand, whereas, conversely, money, supply, measures, like, m2, which, are, in, some, cases, more, closely, correlated, with, aggregate, demand, are, difficult, to, control, for, the, central, bank, also, in, many, countries, the, relationship, between, aggregate, demand, and, all, money, stock, measures, have, broken, down, in, recent, decades, weakening, further, the, case, for, monetary, policy, rules, focusing, on, the, money, supply, 608, however, while, more, disputed, in, the, 1970s, surveys, of, members, of, the, american, economic, association, aea, since, the, 1990s, have, shown, that, most, professional, american, economists, generally, agree, with, the, statement, inflation, is, caused, primarily, by, too, much, growth, in, the, money, supply, while, the, same, surveys, have, shown, a, lack, of, consensus, by, aea, members, since, the, 1990s, that, in, the, short, run, a, reduction, in, unemployment, causes, the, rate, of, inflation, to, increase, has, developed, despite, more, agreement, with, the, statement, in, the, 1970s, housing, shortages, and, climate, change, have, both, been, cited, as, significant, drivers, of, inflation, in, the, 21st, century, in, 2021, 2022, most, countries, experienced, a, considerable, increase, in, inflation, peaking, in, 2022, and, declining, in, 2023, the, causes, are, believed, to, be, a, mixture, of, demand, and, supply, shocks, whereas, inflation, expectations, generally, seem, to, remain, anchored, as, per, may, 2023, possible, causes, on, the, demand, side, include, expansionary, fiscal, and, monetary, policy, in, the, wake, of, the, global, covid, 19, pandemic, whereas, supply, shocks, include, supply, chain, problems, also, caused, by, the, pandemic, and, exacerbated, by, energy, price, rises, following, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, in, 2022, the, term, sellers, inflation, was, coined, during, this, period, to, describe, the, effect, of, corporate, profits, as, a, possible, cause, of, inflation, price, inelasticity, can, contribute, to, inflation, when, firms, consolidate, tending, to, support, monopoly, or, monopsony, conditions, anywhere, along, the, supply, chain, for, goods, or, services, when, this, occurs, firms, can, provide, greater, shareholder, value, by, taking, a, larger, proportion, of, profits, than, by, investing, in, providing, greater, volumes, of, their, outputs, shortly, after, initial, energy, price, shocks, caused, by, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, had, subsided, oil, companies, found, that, supply, chain, constrictions, already, exacerbated, by, the, ongoing, global, pandemic, supported, price, inelasticity, i, e, they, began, lowering, prices, to, match, the, price, of, oil, when, it, fell, much, more, slowly, than, they, had, increased, their, prices, when, costs, rose, the, quantity, theory, of, money, has, long, been, popular, with, libertarian, conservative, critics, of, the, federal, reserve, during, the, covid, pandemic, and, its, immediate, aftermath, the, m2, money, supply, increased, at, the, fastest, rate, in, decades, leading, some, to, link, the, growth, to, the, 2021, 2023, inflation, surge, fed, chairman, jerome, powell, said, in, december, 2021, that, the, once, strong, link, between, the, money, supply, and, inflation, ended, about, 40, years, ago, due, to, financial, innovations, and, deregulation, powell, s, immediate, predecessors, ben, bernanke, and, alan, greenspan, had, previously, concurred, with, this, position, the, broadest, measure, of, money, supply, m3, increased, about, 45, from, 2010, through, 2015, far, faster, than, gdp, growth, yet, the, inflation, rate, declined, during, that, period, the, opposite, of, what, monetarism, would, have, predicted, a, lower, velocity, of, money, than, was, historically, the, case, was, also, cited, for, a, diminished, effect, of, growth, in, the, money, supply, on, inflation, additionally, there, are, theories, about, inflation, accepted, by, economists, outside, of, the, mainstream, the, austrian, school, stresses, that, inflation, is, not, uniform, over, all, assets, goods, and, services, inflation, depends, on, differences, in, markets, and, on, where, newly, created, money, and, credit, enter, the, economy, ludwig, von, mises, said, that, inflation, should, refer, to, an, increase, in, the, quantity, of, money, that, is, not, offset, by, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, need, for, money, and, that, price, inflation, will, necessarily, follow, always, leaving, a, poorer, nation, inflation, is, the, decrease, in, the, purchasing, power, of, a, currency, that, is, when, the, general, level, of, prices, rise, each, monetary, unit, can, buy, fewer, goods, and, services, in, aggregate, the, effect, of, inflation, differs, on, different, sectors, of, the, economy, with, some, sectors, being, adversely, affected, while, others, benefitting, for, example, with, inflation, those, segments, in, society, which, own, physical, assets, such, as, property, stock, etc, benefit, from, the, price, value, of, their, holdings, going, up, when, those, who, seek, to, acquire, them, will, need, to, pay, more, for, them, their, ability, to, do, so, will, depend, on, the, degree, to, which, their, income, is, fixed, for, example, increases, in, payments, to, workers, and, pensioners, often, lag, behind, inflation, and, for, some, people, income, is, fixed, also, individuals, or, institutions, with, cash, assets, will, experience, a, decline, in, the, purchasing, power, of, the, cash, increases, in, the, price, level, inflation, erode, the, real, value, of, money, the, functional, currency, and, other, items, with, an, underlying, monetary, nature, debtors, who, have, debts, with, a, fixed, nominal, rate, of, interest, will, see, a, reduction, in, the, real, interest, rate, as, the, inflation, rate, rises, the, real, interest, on, a, loan, is, the, nominal, rate, minus, the, inflation, rate, the, formula, r, n, i, approximates, the, correct, answer, as, long, as, both, the, nominal, interest, rate, and, the, inflation, rate, are, small, the, correct, equation, is, r, n, i, where, r, n, and, i, are, expressed, as, ratios, e, g, 1, 2, for, 20, 0, 8, for, 20, as, an, example, when, the, inflation, rate, is, 3, a, loan, with, a, nominal, interest, rate, of, 5, would, have, a, real, interest, rate, of, approximately, 2, in, fact, it, s, 1, 94, any, unexpected, increase, in, the, inflation, rate, would, decrease, the, real, interest, rate, banks, and, other, lenders, adjust, for, this, inflation, risk, either, by, including, an, inflation, risk, premium, to, fixed, interest, rate, loans, or, lending, at, an, adjustable, rate, high, or, unpredictable, inflation, rates, are, regarded, as, harmful, to, an, overall, economy, they, add, inefficiencies, in, the, market, and, make, it, difficult, for, companies, to, budget, or, plan, long, term, inflation, can, act, as, a, drag, on, productivity, as, companies, are, forced, to, shift, resources, away, from, products, and, services, to, focus, on, profit, and, losses, from, currency, inflation, uncertainty, about, the, future, purchasing, power, of, money, discourages, investment, and, saving, inflation, hurts, asset, prices, such, as, stock, performance, in, the, short, run, as, it, erodes, non, energy, corporates, profit, margins, and, leads, to, central, banks, policy, tightening, measures, inflation, can, also, impose, hidden, tax, increases, for, instance, inflated, earnings, push, taxpayers, into, higher, income, tax, rates, unless, the, tax, brackets, are, indexed, to, inflation, with, high, inflation, purchasing, power, is, redistributed, from, those, on, fixed, nominal, incomes, such, as, some, pensioners, whose, pensions, are, not, indexed, to, the, price, level, towards, those, with, variable, incomes, whose, earnings, may, better, keep, pace, with, the, inflation, this, redistribution, of, purchasing, power, will, also, occur, between, international, trading, partners, where, fixed, exchange, rates, are, imposed, higher, inflation, in, one, economy, than, another, will, cause, the, first, economy, s, exports, to, become, more, expensive, and, affect, the, balance, of, trade, there, can, also, be, negative, effects, to, trade, from, an, increased, instability, in, currency, exchange, prices, caused, by, unpredictable, inflation, the, real, purchasing, power, of, fixed, payments, is, eroded, by, inflation, unless, they, are, inflation, adjusted, to, keep, their, real, values, constant, in, many, countries, employment, contracts, pension, benefits, and, government, entitlements, such, as, social, security, are, tied, to, a, cost, of, living, index, typically, to, the, consumer, price, index, a, cost, of, living, adjustment, cola, adjusts, salaries, based, on, changes, in, a, cost, of, living, index, it, does, not, control, inflation, but, rather, seeks, to, mitigate, the, consequences, of, inflation, for, those, on, fixed, incomes, salaries, are, typically, adjusted, annually, in, low, inflation, economies, during, hyperinflation, they, are, adjusted, more, often, they, may, also, be, tied, to, a, cost, of, living, index, that, varies, by, geographic, location, if, the, employee, moves, annual, escalation, clauses, in, employment, contracts, can, specify, retroactive, or, future, percentage, increases, in, worker, pay, which, are, not, tied, to, any, index, these, negotiated, increases, in, pay, are, colloquially, referred, to, as, cost, of, living, adjustments, colas, or, cost, of, living, increases, because, of, their, similarity, to, increases, tied, to, externally, determined, indexes, monetary, policy, is, the, policy, enacted, by, the, monetary, authorities, most, frequently, the, central, bank, of, a, nation, to, accomplish, their, objectives, among, these, keeping, inflation, at, a, low, and, stable, level, is, often, a, prominent, objective, either, directly, via, inflation, targeting, or, indirectly, e, g, via, a, fixed, exchange, rate, against, a, low, inflation, currency, area, historically, central, banks, and, governments, have, followed, various, policies, to, achieve, low, inflation, employing, various, nominal, anchors, before, world, war, i, the, gold, standard, was, prevalent, but, was, eventually, found, to, be, detrimental, to, economic, stability, and, employment, not, least, during, the, great, depression, in, the, 1930s, for, the, first, decades, after, world, war, ii, the, bretton, woods, system, initiated, a, fixed, exchange, rate, system, for, most, developed, countries, tying, their, currencies, to, the, us, dollar, which, again, was, directly, convertible, to, gold, the, system, disintegrated, in, the, 1970s, however, after, which, the, major, currencies, started, floating, against, each, other, during, the, 1970s, many, central, banks, turned, to, a, money, supply, target, recommended, by, milton, friedman, and, other, monetarists, aiming, for, a, stable, growth, rate, of, money, to, control, inflation, however, it, was, found, to, be, impractical, because, of, the, unstable, relationship, between, monetary, aggregates, and, other, macroeconomic, variables, and, was, eventually, abandoned, by, all, major, economies, in, 1990, new, zealand, as, the, first, country, ever, adopted, an, official, inflation, target, as, the, basis, of, its, monetary, policy, continually, adjusting, interest, rates, to, steer, the, country, s, inflation, rate, towards, its, official, target, the, strategy, was, generally, considered, to, work, well, and, central, banks, in, most, developed, countries, have, over, the, years, adapted, a, similar, strategy, as, of, 2023, the, central, banks, of, all, g7, member, countries, can, be, said, to, follow, an, inflation, target, including, the, european, central, bank, and, the, federal, reserve, who, have, adopted, the, main, elements, of, inflation, targeting, without, officially, calling, themselves, inflation, targeters, in, emerging, countries, fixed, exchange, rate, regimes, are, still, the, most, common, monetary, policy, from, its, first, inception, in, new, zealand, in, 1990, direct, inflation, targeting, as, a, monetary, policy, strategy, has, spread, to, become, prevalent, among, developed, countries, the, basic, idea, is, that, the, central, bank, perpetually, adjusts, interest, rates, to, steer, the, country, s, inflation, rate, towards, its, official, target, via, the, monetary, transmission, mechanism, interest, rate, changes, affect, aggregate, demand, in, various, ways, causing, output, and, employment, to, respond, changes, in, employment, and, unemployment, rates, affect, wage, setting, leading, to, larger, or, smaller, wage, increases, depending, on, the, direction, of, the, interest, rate, adjustment, a, changed, rate, of, wage, increases, will, transmit, into, changes, in, price, setting, i, e, a, change, in, the, inflation, rate, the, relation, between, un, employment, and, inflation, is, known, as, the, phillips, curve, in, most, oecd, countries, the, inflation, target, is, usually, about, 2, to, 3, in, developing, countries, like, armenia, the, inflation, target, is, higher, at, around, 4, low, as, opposed, to, zero, or, negative, inflation, reduces, the, severity, of, economic, recessions, by, enabling, the, labor, market, to, adjust, more, quickly, in, a, downturn, and, reduces, the, risk, that, a, liquidity, trap, prevents, monetary, policy, from, stabilizing, the, economy, under, a, fixed, exchange, rate, currency, regime, a, country, s, currency, is, tied, in, value, to, another, single, currency, or, to, a, basket, of, other, currencies, a, fixed, exchange, rate, is, usually, used, to, stabilize, the, value, of, a, currency, vis, a, vis, the, currency, it, is, pegged, to, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, means, to, control, inflation, if, the, currency, area, tied, to, itself, maintains, low, and, stable, inflation, however, as, the, value, of, the, reference, currency, rises, and, falls, so, does, the, currency, pegged, to, it, this, essentially, means, that, the, inflation, rate, in,
