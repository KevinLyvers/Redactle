a, rune, is, a, letter, in, a, set, of, related, alphabets, known, as, runic, alphabets, native, to, the, germanic, peoples, runes, were, used, to, write, germanic, languages, with, some, exceptions, before, they, adopted, the, latin, alphabet, and, for, specialised, purposes, thereafter, in, addition, to, representing, a, sound, value, a, phoneme, runes, can, be, used, to, represent, the, concepts, after, which, they, are, named, ideographs, scholars, refer, to, instances, of, the, latter, as, begriffsrunen, concept, runes, the, scandinavian, variants, are, also, known, as, fu, ark, or, futhark, these, names, derived, from, the, first, six, letters, of, the, script, and, corresponding, to, the, latin, letters, f, u, th, a, r, and, k, the, anglo, saxon, variant, is, futhorc, or, fu, orc, due, to, changes, in, old, english, of, the, sounds, represented, by, the, fourth, letter, runology, is, the, academic, study, of, the, runic, alphabets, runic, inscriptions, runestones, and, their, history, runology, forms, a, specialised, branch, of, germanic, philology, the, earliest, secure, runic, inscriptions, date, from, around, ad, 150, with, a, potentially, earlier, inscription, dating, to, ad, 50, and, tacitus, s, potential, description, of, rune, use, from, around, ad, 98, the, svingerud, runestone, dates, from, between, ad, 1, and, 250, runes, were, generally, replaced, by, the, latin, alphabet, as, the, cultures, that, had, used, runes, underwent, christianisation, by, approximately, ad, 700, in, central, europe, and, 1100, in, northern, europe, however, the, use, of, runes, persisted, for, specialized, purposes, beyond, this, period, up, until, the, early, 20th, century, runes, were, still, used, in, rural, sweden, for, decorative, purposes, in, dalarna, and, on, runic, calendars, the, three, best, known, runic, alphabets, are, the, elder, futhark, c, ad, 150, 800, the, anglo, saxon, futhorc, 400, 1100, and, the, younger, futhark, 800, 1100, the, younger, futhark, is, divided, further, into, the, long, branch, runes, also, called, danish, although, they, were, also, used, in, norway, sweden, and, frisia, short, branch, or, r, k, runes, also, called, swedish, norwegian, although, they, were, also, used, in, denmark, and, the, stavl, sa, or, h, lsinge, runes, staveless, runes, the, younger, futhark, developed, further, into, the, medieval, runes, 1100, 1500, and, the, dalecarlian, runes, c, 1500, 1800, the, exact, development, of, the, early, runic, alphabet, remains, unclear, but, the, script, ultimately, stems, from, the, phoenician, alphabet, early, runes, may, have, developed, from, the, raetic, venetic, etruscan, or, old, latin, as, candidates, at, the, time, all, of, these, scripts, had, the, same, angular, letter, shapes, suited, for, epigraphy, which, would, become, characteristic, of, the, runes, and, related, scripts, in, the, region, the, process, of, transmission, of, the, script, is, unknown, the, oldest, clear, inscriptions, are, found, in, denmark, and, northern, germany, a, west, germanic, hypothesis, suggests, transmission, via, elbe, germanic, groups, while, a, gothic, hypothesis, presumes, transmission, via, east, germanic, expansion, runes, continue, to, be, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, ways, in, modern, popular, culture, the, name, stems, from, a, proto, germanic, form, reconstructed, as, r, n, which, may, be, translated, as, secret, mystery, secret, conversation, rune, it, is, the, source, of, gothic, r, na, secret, mystery, counsel, old, english, r, n, whisper, mystery, secret, rune, old, saxon, r, na, secret, counsel, confidential, talk, middle, dutch, r, ne, id, old, high, german, r, na, secret, mystery, and, old, norse, r, n, secret, mystery, rune, the, earliest, germanic, epigraphic, attestation, is, the, primitive, norse, r, n, accusative, singular, found, on, the, einang, stone, ad, 350, 400, and, the, noleby, stone, ad, 450, the, term, is, related, to, proto, celtic, r, na, secret, magic, which, is, attested, in, old, irish, r, n, mystery, secret, middle, welsh, rin, mystery, charm, middle, breton, rin, secret, wisdom, and, possibly, in, the, ancient, gaulish, cobrunus, com, r, nos, confident, cf, middle, welsh, cyfrin, middle, breton, queffrin, middle, irish, comr, n, shared, secret, confidence, and, sacruna, sacro, runa, sacred, secret, as, well, as, in, lepontic, runatis, runo, tis, belonging, to, the, secret, however, it, is, difficult, to, tell, whether, they, are, cognates, linguistic, siblings, from, a, common, origin, or, if, the, proto, germanic, form, reflects, an, early, borrowing, from, celtic, various, connections, have, been, proposed, with, other, indo, european, terms, for, example, sanskrit, r, uti, roar, latin, r, mor, noise, rumor, ancient, greek, er, ask, and, ereun, investigate, although, linguist, ranko, matasovi, finds, them, difficult, to, justify, for, semantic, or, linguistic, reasons, because, of, this, some, scholars, have, speculated, that, the, germanic, and, celtic, words, may, have, been, a, shared, religious, term, borrowed, from, an, unknown, non, indo, european, language, in, early, germanic, a, rune, could, also, be, referred, to, as, r, na, stabaz, a, compound, of, r, n, and, stabaz, staff, letter, it, is, attested, in, old, norse, r, na, stafr, old, english, r, n, st, f, and, old, high, german, r, n, stab, other, germanic, terms, derived, from, r, n, include, run, n, counsellor, r, njan, and, ga, r, njan, secret, mystery, raun, trial, inquiry, experiment, hugi, r, n, secret, of, the, mind, magical, rune, and, halja, r, n, witch, sorceress, literally, hel, secret, it, is, also, often, part, of, personal, names, including, gothic, runilo, frankish, r, nfrid, old, norse, alfr, n, dagr, n, gu, r, n, sigr, n, lr, n, old, english, lfr, n, and, lombardic, goder, na, the, finnish, word, runo, meaning, poem, is, an, early, borrowing, from, proto, germanic, and, the, source, of, the, term, for, rune, riimukirjain, meaning, scratched, letter, the, root, may, also, be, found, in, the, baltic, languages, where, lithuanian, runoti, means, both, to, cut, with, a, knife, and, to, speak, the, old, english, form, r, n, survived, into, the, early, modern, period, as, roun, which, is, now, obsolete, the, modern, english, rune, is, a, later, formation, that, is, partly, derived, from, late, latin, runa, old, norse, r, n, and, danish, rune, the, runes, were, in, use, among, the, germanic, peoples, from, the, 1st, or, 2nd, century, ad, this, period, corresponds, to, the, late, common, germanic, stage, linguistically, with, a, continuum, of, dialects, not, yet, clearly, separated, into, the, three, branches, of, later, centuries, north, germanic, west, germanic, and, east, germanic, no, distinction, is, made, in, surviving, runic, inscriptions, between, long, and, short, vowels, although, such, a, distinction, was, certainly, present, phonologically, in, the, spoken, languages, of, the, time, similarly, there, are, no, signs, for, labiovelars, in, the, elder, futhark, such, signs, were, introduced, in, both, the, anglo, saxon, futhorc, and, the, gothic, alphabet, as, variants, of, p, see, peor, the, formation, of, the, elder, futhark, was, complete, by, the, early, 5th, century, with, the, kylver, stone, being, the, first, evidence, of, the, futhark, ordering, as, well, as, of, the, p, rune, specifically, the, rhaetic, alphabet, of, bolzano, is, often, advanced, as, a, candidate, for, the, origin, of, the, runes, with, only, five, elder, futhark, runes, e, j, p, having, no, counterpart, in, the, bolzano, alphabet, scandinavian, scholars, tend, to, favor, derivation, from, the, latin, alphabet, itself, over, rhaetic, candidates, a, north, etruscan, thesis, is, supported, by, the, inscription, on, the, negau, helmet, dating, to, the, 2nd, century, bc, this, is, in, a, northern, etruscan, alphabet, but, features, a, germanic, name, harigast, giuliano, and, larissa, bonfante, suggest, that, runes, derived, from, some, north, italic, alphabet, specifically, venetic, but, since, romans, conquered, veneto, after, 200, bc, and, then, the, latin, alphabet, became, prominent, and, venetic, culture, diminished, in, importance, germanic, people, could, have, adopted, the, venetic, alphabet, within, the, 3rd, century, bc, or, even, earlier, the, angular, shapes, of, the, runes, are, shared, with, most, contemporary, alphabets, of, the, period, that, were, used, for, carving, in, wood, or, stone, there, are, no, horizontal, strokes, when, carving, a, message, on, a, flat, staff, or, stick, it, would, be, along, the, grain, thus, both, less, legible, and, more, likely, to, split, the, wood, this, characteristic, is, also, shared, by, other, alphabets, such, as, the, early, form, of, the, latin, alphabet, used, for, the, duenos, inscription, but, it, is, not, universal, especially, among, early, runic, inscriptions, which, frequently, have, variant, rune, shapes, including, horizontal, strokes, runic, manuscripts, that, is, written, rather, than, carved, runes, such, as, codex, runicus, also, show, horizontal, strokes, the, west, germanic, hypothesis, speculates, on, an, introduction, by, west, germanic, tribes, this, hypothesis, is, based, on, claiming, that, the, earliest, inscriptions, of, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, found, in, bogs, and, graves, around, jutland, the, vimose, inscriptions, exhibit, word, endings, that, being, interpreted, by, scandinavian, scholars, to, be, proto, norse, are, considered, unresolved, and, long, having, been, the, subject, of, discussion, in, the, early, runic, period, differences, between, germanic, languages, are, generally, presumed, to, be, small, another, theory, presumes, a, northwest, germanic, unity, preceding, the, emergence, of, proto, norse, proper, from, roughly, the, 5th, century, an, alternative, suggestion, explaining, the, impossibility, of, classifying, the, earliest, inscriptions, as, either, north, or, west, germanic, is, forwarded, by, a, makaev, who, presumes, a, special, runic, koine, an, early, literary, germanic, employed, by, the, entire, late, common, germanic, linguistic, community, after, the, separation, of, gothic, 2nd, to, 5th, centuries, while, the, spoken, dialects, may, already, have, been, more, diverse, with, the, potential, exception, of, the, meldorf, fibula, a, possible, runic, inscription, found, in, schleswig, holstein, dating, to, around, 50, ad, the, earliest, reference, to, runes, and, runic, divination, may, occur, in, roman, senator, tacitus, s, ethnographic, germania, dating, from, around, 98, ce, tacitus, describes, the, germanic, peoples, as, utilizing, a, divination, practice, involving, rune, like, inscriptions, for, divination, and, casting, lots, they, have, the, highest, possible, regard, their, procedure, for, casting, lots, is, uniform, they, break, off, the, branch, of, a, fruit, tree, and, slice, into, strips, they, mark, these, by, certain, signs, and, throw, them, as, random, chance, will, have, it, on, to, a, white, cloth, then, a, state, priest, if, the, consultation, is, a, public, one, or, the, father, of, the, family, if, it, is, private, prays, to, the, gods, and, gazing, to, the, heavens, picks, up, three, separate, strips, and, reads, their, meaning, from, the, marks, scored, on, them, if, the, lots, forbid, an, enterprise, there, can, be, no, further, consultation, about, it, that, day, if, they, allow, it, further, confirmation, by, divination, is, required, as, victoria, symons, summarizes, if, the, inscriptions, made, on, the, lots, that, tacitus, refers, to, are, understood, to, be, letters, rather, than, other, kinds, of, notations, or, symbols, then, they, would, necessarily, have, been, runes, since, no, other, writing, system, was, available, to, germanic, tribes, at, this, time, runic, inscriptions, from, the, 400, year, period, 150, 550, ad, are, described, as, period, i, these, inscriptions, are, generally, in, elder, futhark, but, the, set, of, letter, shapes, and, bindrunes, employed, is, far, from, standardized, notably, the, j, s, and, runes, undergo, considerable, modifications, while, others, such, as, p, and, remain, unattested, altogether, prior, to, the, first, full, futhark, row, on, the, kylver, stone, c, 400, ad, artifacts, such, as, spear, heads, or, shield, mounts, have, been, found, that, bear, runic, marking, that, may, be, dated, to, 200, ad, as, evidenced, by, artifacts, found, across, northern, europe, in, schleswig, north, germany, funen, zealand, jutland, denmark, and, scania, sweden, earlier, but, less, reliable, artifacts, have, been, found, in, meldorf, s, derdithmarschen, in, northern, germany, these, include, brooches, and, combs, found, in, graves, most, notably, the, meldorf, fibula, and, are, supposed, to, have, the, earliest, markings, resembling, runic, inscriptions, the, stanza, 157, of, h, vam, l, attribute, to, runes, the, power, to, bring, that, which, is, dead, back, to, life, in, this, stanza, odin,

the, name, of, either, the, craftsman, or, the, proprietor, or, sometimes, remain, a, linguistic, mystery, due, to, this, it, is, possible, that, the, early, runes, were, not, used, so, much, as, a, simple, writing, system, but, rather, as, magical, signs, to, be, used, for, charms, although, some, say, the, runes, were, used, for, divination, there, is, no, direct, evidence, to, suggest, they, were, ever, used, in, this, way, the, name, rune, itself, taken, to, mean, secret, something, hidden, seems, to, indicate, that, knowledge, of, the, runes, was, originally, considered, esoteric, or, restricted, to, an, elite, the, 6th, century, bj, rketorp, runestone, warns, in, proto, norse, using, the, word, rune, in, both, senses, haidzruno, runu, falahak, haidera, ginnarunaz, arageu,

he, who, breaks, this, monument, i, prophesy, destruction, prophecy, of, destruction, the, same, curse, and, use, of, the, word, rune, is, also, found, on, the, stentoften, runestone, there, also, are, some, inscriptions, suggesting, a, medieval, belief, in, the, magical, significance, of, runes, such, as, the, franks, casket, ad, 700, panel, charm, words, such, as, auja, la, u, lauka, and, most, commonly, alu, appear, on, a, number, of, migration, period, elder, futhark, inscriptions, as, well, as, variants, and, abbreviations, of, them, much, speculation, and, study, has, been, produced, on, the, potential, meaning, of, these, inscriptions, rhyming, groups, appear, on, some, early, bracteates, that, also, may, be, magical, in, purpose, such, as, salusalu, and, luwatuwa, further, an, inscription, on, the, gummarp, runestone, 500, 700, ad, gives, a, cryptic, inscription, describing, the, use, of, three, runic, letters, followed, by, the, elder, futhark, f, rune, written, three, times, in, succession, nevertheless, it, has, proven, difficult, to, find, unambiguous, traces, of, runic, oracles, although, norse, literature, is, full, of, references, to, runes, it, nowhere, contains, specific, instructions, on, divination, there, are, at, least, three, sources, on, divination, with, rather, vague, descriptions, that, may, or, may, not, refer, to, runes, tacitus, s, 1st, century, germania, snorri, sturluson, s, 13th, century, ynglinga, saga, and, rimbert, s, 9th, century, vita, ansgari, the, first, source, tacitus, s, germania, describes, signs, chosen, in, groups, of, three, and, cut, from, a, nut, bearing, tree, although, the, runes, do, not, seem, to, have, been, in, use, at, the, time, of, tacitus, writings, a, second, source, is, the, ynglinga, saga, where, granmar, the, king, of, s, dermanland, goes, to, uppsala, for, the, bl, t, there, the, chips, fell, in, a, way, that, said, that, he, would, not, live, long, f, ll, honum, svo, sp, nn, sem, hann, mundi, eigi, lengi, lifa, these, chips, however, are, easily, explainable, as, a, bl, tsp, nn, sacrificial, chip, which, was, marked, possibly, with, sacrificial, blood, shaken, and, thrown, down, like, dice, and, their, positive, or, negative, significance, then, decided, the, third, source, is, rimbert, s, vita, ansgari, where, there, are, three, accounts, of, what, some, believe, to, be, the, use, of, runes, for, divination, but, rimbert, calls, it, drawing, lots, one, of, these, accounts, is, the, description, of, how, a, renegade, swedish, king, anund, uppsale, first, brings, a, danish, fleet, to, birka, but, then, changes, his, mind, and, asks, the, danes, to, draw, lots, according, to, the, story, this, drawing, of, lots, was, quite, informative, telling, them, that, attacking, birka, would, bring, bad, luck, and, that, they, should, attack, a, slavic, town, instead, the, tool, in, the, drawing, of, lots, however, is, easily, explainable, as, a, hlautlein, lot, twig, which, according, to, foote, and, wilson, would, be, used, in, the, same, manner, as, a, bl, tsp, nn, the, lack, of, extensive, knowledge, on, historical, use, of, the, runes, has, not, stopped, modern, authors, from, extrapolating, entire, systems, of, divination, from, what, few, specifics, exist, usually, loosely, based, on, the, reconstructed, names, of, the, runes, and, additional, outside, influence, a, recent, study, of, runic, magic, suggests, that, runes, were, used, to, create, magical, objects, such, as, amulets, but, not, in, a, way, that, would, indicate, that, runic, writing, was, any, more, inherently, magical, than, were, other, writing, systems, such, as, latin, or, greek, as, proto, germanic, evolved, into, its, later, language, groups, the, words, assigned, to, the, runes, and, the, sounds, represented, by, the, runes, themselves, began, to, diverge, somewhat, and, each, culture, would, create, new, runes, rename, or, rearrange, its, rune, names, slightly, or, stop, using, obsolete, runes, completely, to, accommodate, these, changes, thus, the, anglo, saxon, futhorc, has, several, runes, peculiar, to, itself, to, represent, diphthongs, unique, to, or, at, least, prevalent, in, old, english, some, later, runic, finds, are, on, monuments, runestones, which, often, contain, solemn, inscriptions, about, people, who, died, or, performed, great, deeds, for, a, long, time, it, was, presumed, that, this, kind, of, grand, inscription, was, the, primary, use, of, runes, and, that, their, use, was, associated, with, a, certain, societal, class, of, rune, carvers, in, the, mid, 1950s, however, approximately, 670, inscriptions, known, as, the, bryggen, inscriptions, were, found, in, bergen, these, inscriptions, were, made, on, wood, and, bone, often, in, the, shape, of, sticks, of, various, sizes, and, contained, information, of, an, everyday, nature, ranging, from, name, tags, prayers, often, in, latin, personal, messages, business, letters, and, expressions, of, affection, to, bawdy, phrases, of, a, profane, and, sometimes, even, of, a, vulgar, nature, following, this, find, it, is, nowadays, commonly, presumed, that, at, least, in, late, use, runic, was, a, widespread, and, common, writing, system, in, the, later, middle, ages, runes, also, were, used, in, the, clog, almanacs, sometimes, called, runic, staff, prim, or, scandinavian, calendar, of, sweden, and, estonia, the, authenticity, of, some, monuments, bearing, runic, inscriptions, found, in, northern, america, is, disputed, most, of, them, have, been, dated, to, modern, times, in, norse, mythology, the, runic, alphabet, is, attested, to, a, divine, origin, old, norse, reginkunnr, this, is, attested, as, early, as, on, the, noleby, runestone, from, c, 600, ad, that, reads, runo, fahi, raginakundo, toj, a, meaning, i, prepare, the, suitable, divine, rune, and, in, an, attestation, from, the, 9th, century, on, the, sparl, sa, runestone, which, reads, ok, ra, runa, a, r, gi, kundu, meaning, and, interpret, the, runes, of, divine, origin, in, the, poetic, edda, poem, h, vam, l, stanza, 80, the, runes, also, are, described, as, reginkunnr, at, er, reynt, er, at, r, num, spyrr, inum, reginkunnum, eim, er, ger, u, ginnregin, ok, f, i, fimbul, ulr, hefir, hann, bazt, ef, hann, egir, that, is, now, proved, what, you, asked,

that, the, originator, of, the, runes, was, the, major, deity, odin, stanza, 138, describes, how, odin, received, the, runes, through, self, sacrifice, veit, ek, at, ek, hekk, vindga, mei, i, a, netr,

relates, how, r, g, identified, as, heimdall, in, the, introduction, sired, three, sons, thrall, slave, churl, freeman, and, jarl, noble, by, human, women, these, sons, became, the, ancestors, of, the, three, classes, of, humans, indicated, by, their, names, when, jarl, reached, an, age, when, he, began, to, handle, weapons, and, show, other, signs, of, nobility, r, g, returned, and, having, claimed, him, as, a, son, taught, him, the, runes, in, 1555, the, exiled, swedish, archbishop, olaus, magnus, recorded, a, tradition, that, a, man, named, kettil, runske, had, stolen, three, rune, staffs, from, odin, and, learned, the, runes, and, their, magic, the, elder, futhark, used, for, writing, proto, norse, consists, of, 24, runes, that, often, are, arranged, in, three, groups, of, eight, each, group, is, referred, to, as, an, tt, old, norse, meaning, clan, group, the, earliest, known, sequential, listing, of, the, full, set, of, 24, runes, dates, to, approximately, ad, 400, and, is, found, on, the, kylver, stone, in, gotland, sweden, most, probably, each, rune, had, a, name, chosen, to, represent, the, sound, of, the, rune, itself, the, names, are, however, not, directly, attested, for, the, elder, futhark, themselves, germanic, philologists, reconstruct, names, in, proto, germanic, based, on, the, names, given, for, the, runes, in, the, later, alphabets, attested, in, the, rune, poems, and, the, linked, names, of, the, letters, of, the, gothic, alphabet, for, example, the, letter, a, was, named, from, the, runic, letter, called, ansuz, an, asterisk, before, the, rune, names, means, that, they, are, unattested, reconstructions, the, 24, elder, futhark, runes, are, the, following, the, anglo, saxon, runes, also, known, as, the, futhorc, sometimes, written, fu, orc, are, an, extended, alphabet, consisting, of, 29, and, later, 33, characters, it, was, probably, used, from, the, 5th, century, onwards, there, are, competing, theories, as, to, the, origins, of, the, anglo, saxon, also, called, anglo, frisian, futhorc, one, theory, proposes, that, it, was, developed, in, frisia, and, later, spread, to, england, while, another, holds, that, scandinavians, introduced, runes, to, england, where, the, futhorc, was, modified, and, exported, to, frisia, some, examples, of, futhorc, inscriptions, are, found, on, the, thames, scramasax, in, the, vienna, codex, in, cotton, otho, b, x, anglo, saxon, rune, poem, and, on, the, ruthwell, cross, the, anglo, saxon, rune, poem, gives, the, following, characters, and, names, feoh, ur, orn, os, rad, cen, gyfu, ynn, h, gl, nyd, is, ger, eoh, peor, eolh, sigel, tir, beorc, eh, mann, lagu, ing, thel, d, g, ac, sc, yr, ior, ear, extra, runes, attested, to, outside, of, the, rune, poem, include, cweor, calc, gar, and, stan, some, of, these, additional, letters, have, only, been, found, in, manuscripts, feoh, orn, and, sigel, stood, for, and, in, most, environments, but, voiced, to, and, between, vowels, or, voiced, consonants, gyfu, and, wynn, stood, for, the, letters, yogh, and, wynn, which, became, and, in, middle, english, a, runic, alphabet, consisting, of, a, mixture, of, elder, futhark, with, anglo, saxon, futhorc, is, recorded, in, a, treatise, called, de, inventione, litterarum, ascribed, to, hrabanus, maurus, and, preserved, in, 8th, and, 9th, century, manuscripts, mainly, from, the, southern, part, of, the, carolingian, empire, alemannia, bavaria, the, manuscript, text, attributes, the, runes, to, the, marcomanni, quos, nos, nordmannos, vocamus, and, hence, traditionally, the, alphabet, is, called, marcomannic, runes, but, it, has, no, connection, with, the, marcomanni, and, rather, is, an, attempt, of, carolingian, scholars, to, represent, all, letters, of, the, latin, alphabets, with, runic, equivalents, wilhelm, grimm, discussed, these, runes, in, 1821, the, younger, futhark, also, called, scandinavian, futhark, is, a, reduced, form, of, the, elder, futhark, consisting, of, only, 16, characters, the, reduction, correlates, with, phonetic, changes, when, proto, norse, evolved, into, old, norse, they, are, found, in, scandinavia, and, viking, age, settlements, abroad, probably, in, use, from, the, 9th, century, onward, they, are, divided, into, long, branch, danish, and, short, twig, swedish, and, norwegian, runes, the, difference, between, the, two, versions, is, a, matter, of, controversy, a, general, opinion, is, that, the, difference, between, them, was, functional, viz, the, long, branch, runes, were, used, for, documentation, on, stone, whereas, the, short, twig, runes, were, in, everyday, use, for, private, or, official, messages, on, wood, in, the, middle, ages, the, younger, futhark, in, scandinavia, was, expanded, so, that, it, once, more, contained, one, sign, for, each, phoneme, of, the, old, norse, language, dotted, variants, of, voiceless, signs, were, introduced, to, denote, the, corresponding, voiced, consonants, or, vice, versa, voiceless, variants, of, voiced, consonants, and, several, new, runes, also, appeared, for, vowel, sounds, inscriptions, in, medieval, scandinavian, runes, show, a, large, number, of, variant, rune, forms, and, some, letters, such, as, s, c, and, z, often, were, used, interchangeably, medieval, runes, were, in, use, until, the, 15th, century, of, the, total, number, of, norwegian, runic, inscriptions, preserved, today, most, are, medieval, runes, notably, more, than, 600, inscriptions, using, these, runes, have, been, discovered, in, bergen, since, the, 1950s, mostly, on, wooden, sticks, the, so, called, bryggen, inscriptions, this, indicates, that, runes, were, in, common, use, side, by, side, with, the, latin, alphabet, for, several, centuries, indeed, some, of, the, medieval, runic, inscriptions, are, written, in, latin, according, to, carl, gustav, werner, in, the, isolated, province, of, dalarna, in, sweden, a, mix, of, runes, and, latin, letters, developed, the, dalecarlian, runes, came, into, use, in, the, early, 16th, century, and, remained, in, some, use, up, to, the, 20th, century, some, discussion, remains, on, whether, their, use, was, an, unbroken, tradition, throughout, this, period, or, whether, people, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, learned, runes, from, books, written, on, the, subject, the, character, inventory, was, used, mainly, for, transcribing, swedish, in, areas, where, elfdalian, was, predominant, while, roman, script, would, ultimately, replace, runes, in, most, contexts, it, differed, significantly, from, runic, script, for, example, on, the, differences, between, the, use, of, anglo, saxon, runes, and, the, latin, script, that, would, come, to, replace, them, runologist, victoria, symons, says, as, well, as, being, distinguished, from, the, roman, alphabet, in, visual, appearance, and, letter, order, the, fu, orc, is, further, set, apart, by, the, fact, that, unlike, their, roman, counterparts, runic, letters, are, often, associated, not, only, with, sound, values, but, also, with, names, these, names, are, often, nouns, and, in, almost, all, instances, they, begin, with, the, sound, value, represented, by, the, associated, letter, the, fact, that, each, rune, represents, a, sound, value, and, a, word, gives, this, writing, system, a, multivalent, quality, that, further, distinguishes, it, from, roman, script, a, roman, letter, simply, represents, its, sound, value, when, used, for, example, for, the, purpose, of, pagination, such, letters, can, assume, added, significance, but, this, is, localised, to, the, context, of, an, individual, manuscript, runic, letters, on, the, other, hand, are, inherently, multivalent, they, can, and, often, do, represent, several, different, kinds, of, information, simultaneously, this, aspect, of, runic, letters, is, one, that, is, frequently, employed, and, exploited, by, writers, and, scribes, who, include, them, in, their, manuscripts, in, addition, to, their, historic, use, as, letters, in, the, runic, alphabets, runes, were, also, used, to, represent, their, names, ideographs, such, instances, are, sometimes, referred, to, by, way, of, the, modern, german, loan, word, begriffsrunen, meaning, concept, runes, singular, begriffsrune, the, criteria, for, the, use, of, begriffsrunen, and, the, frequency, of, their, use, by, ancient, rune, writers, remains, controversial, the, topic, of, begriffsrunen, has, produced, much, discussion, among, runologists, runologist, klaus, d, wel, has, proposed, two, criteria, for, the, identification, of, runes, as, begriffsrunen, a, graphic, argument, and, a, semantic, argument, examples, of, begriffsrunen, or, potential, begriffsrunen, include, the, following, in, addition, to, the, instances, above, several, different, runes, occur, as, ideographs, in, old, english, and, old, norse, manuscripts, featuring, anglo, saxon, runes, and, younger, futhark, runes, respectively, runologist, thomas, birkett, summarizes, these, numerous, instances, as, follows, the, ma, r, rune, is, found, regularly, in, icelandic, manuscripts, the, f, rune, somewhat, less, frequently, whilst, in, anglo, saxon, manuscripts, the, runes, mon, d, g, wynn, and, e, el, are, all, used, on, occasion, these, are, some, of, the, most, functional, of, the, rune, names, occurring, relatively, often, in, written, language, unlike, the, elusive, peor, for, example, which, would, be, of, little, or, no, use, as, an, abbreviation, because, of, its, rarity, the, practicality, of, using, an, abbreviation, for, a, familiar, noun, such, as, man, is, demonstrated, clearly, in, the, old, norse, poem, h, vam, l, where, the, ma, r, rune, is, used, a, total, of, forty, five, times, saving, a, significant, amount, of, space, and, effort, codex, regius, 5, 14, the, modern, study, of, runes, was, initiated, during, the, renaissance, by, johannes, bureus, 1568, 1652, bureus, viewed, runes, as, holy, or, magical, in, a, kabbalistic, sense, the, study, of, runes, was, continued, by, olof, rudbeck, sr, 1630, 1702, and, presented, in, his, collection, atlantica, anders, celsius, 1701, 1744, further, extended, the, science, of, runes, and, travelled, around, the, whole, of, sweden, to, examine, the, runstenar, from, the, golden, age, of, philology, in, the, 19th, century, runology, formed, a, specialized, branch, of, germanic, linguistics, the, largest, group, of, surviving, runic, inscription, are, viking, age, younger, futhark, runestones, commonly, found, in, denmark, and, sweden, another, large, group, are, medieval, runes, most, commonly, found, on, small, objects, often, wooden, sticks, the, largest, concentration, of, runic, inscriptions, are, the, bryggen, inscriptions, found, in, bergen, more, than, 650, in, total, elder, futhark, inscriptions, number, around, 350, about, 260, of, which, are, from, scandinavia, of, which, about, half, are, on, bracteates, anglo, saxon, futhorc, inscriptions, number, around, 100, items, runic, alphabets, have, seen, numerous, uses, since, the, 18th, century, viking, revival, in, scandinavian, romantic, nationalism, gothicismus, and, germanic, occultism, in, the, 19th, century, and, in, the, context, of, the, fantasy, genre, and, of, modern, germanic, paganism, in, the, 20th, century, the, pioneer, of, the, armanist, branch, of, ariosophy, and, one, of, the, more, important, figures, in, esotericism, in, germany, and, austria, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, was, the,

role, in, nazi, symbolism, the, fascination, with, runic, symbolism, was, mostly, limited, to, heinrich, himmler, and, not, shared, by, the, other, members, of, the, nazi, top, echelon, consequently,
