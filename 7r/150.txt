excessively, rather, their, stock, was, fully, consumed, during, shrovetide, as, to, reduce, waste, this, festival, is, known, for, being, a, time, of, great, indulgence, before, lent, which, is, a, time, stressing, the, opposite, with, drinking, overeating, and, various, other, activities, of, indulgence, being, performed, for, example, pancakes, donuts, and, other, desserts, are, prepared, and, eaten, for, a, final, time, during, lent, lacticinia, and, animal, products, are, eaten, less, and, individuals, make, a, lenten, sacrifice, thus, giving, up, a, certain, object, or, activity, of, desire, as, such, during, the, season, of, shrovetide, it, is, customary, for, christians, to, ponder, what, lenten, sacrifices, they, will, make, for, the, coming, lent, the, traditions, of, carrying, shrovetide, rods, and, consuming, shrovetide, buns, after, attending, church, are, celebrated, on, the, final, day, of, the, season, shrove, tuesday, many, traditional, christians, such, as, lutherans, anglicans, and, roman, catholics, make, a, special, point, of, self, examination, of, considering, what, wrongs, they, need, to, repent, and, what, amendments, of, life, or, areas, of, spiritual, growth, they, especially, need, to, ask, god, s, help, in, dealing, with, during, shrovetide, many, churches, place, a, basket, in, the, narthex, to, collect, the, previous, year, s, holy, week, palm, branches, that, were, blessed, and, distributed, during, the, palm, sunday, liturgies, on, shrove, tuesday, the, final, day, of, shrovetide, churches, burn, these, palms, to, make, the, ashes, used, during, the, services, held, on, the, very, next, day, ash, wednesday, the, term, carnival, is, traditionally, used, in, areas, with, a, large, catholic, presence, as, well, as, in, greece, the, celebration, is, known, as, fastelavn, in, historically, evangelical, lutheran, countries, it, is, called, shrovetide, in, areas, with, a, high, concentration, of, anglicans, church, of, england, us, episcopal, church, methodists, and, other, protestants, in, slavic, eastern, orthodox, nations, maslenitsa, is, celebrated, during, the, last, week, before, great, lent, in, german, speaking, europe, and, the, netherlands, the, carnival, season, traditionally, opens, on, 11, 11, often, at, 11, 11, a, m, this, dates, back, to, celebrations, before, the, advent, season, or, with, harvest, celebrations, of, st, martin, s, day, the, word, carnival, is, of, christian, origin, the, latin, derived, name, of, the, holiday, is, sometimes, also, spelled, carnaval, typically, in, areas, where, dutch, french, spanish, and, portuguese, are, spoken, or, carnevale, in, italian, speaking, contexts, alternative, names, are, used, for, regional, and, local, celebrations, the, word, is, said, to, come, from, the, late, latin, expression, carne, levare, which, means, remove, meat, a, folk, etymology, derives, it, from, carne, vale, farewell, to, meat, in, either, case, this, signifies, the, approaching, fast, the, word, carne, may, also, be, translated, as, flesh, producing, a, farewell, to, the, flesh, a, phrase, embraced, by, certain, carnival, celebrants, to, embolden, the, festival, s, carefree, spirit, the, etymology, of, the, word, carnival, thus, points, to, a, christian, origin, of, the, celebratory, period, other, scholars, argue, that, the, origin, of, the, word, is, a, common, meat, based, country, feast, in, latin, carnualia, or, the, festival, of, the, navigium, isidis, ship, of, isis, where, the, image, of, isis, was, carried, to, the, seashore, to, bless, the, start, of, sailing, season, the, festival, consisted, of, a, parade, of, masks, following, an, adorned, wooden, boat, called, in, latin, carrus, navalis, possibly, the, source, of, both, the, name, and, the, parade, floats, the, characteristics, of, the, celebration, of, carnival, take, their, origins, from, ancient, european, festivals, such, as, the, greek, dionysian, the, anthesteria, or, the, roman, saturnalia, during, these, festivities, there, was, a, temporary, release, from, social, obligations, and, hierarchies, to, make, way, for, the, overthrow, of, order, joking, and, even, debauchery, from, a, historical, and, religious, point, of, view, the, carnival, therefore, represented, a, period, of, celebration, but, above, all, of, symbolic, renewal, during, which, chaos, replaced, the, established, order, which, however, once, the, festive, period, was, over, re, emerged, new, or, renewed, and, guaranteed, for, a, cycle, valid, until, the, beginning, of, the, following, carnival, from, an, anthropological, point, of, view, carnival, is, a, reversal, ritual, in, which, social, roles, are, reversed, and, norms, about, desired, behavior, are, suspended, during, antiquity, winter, was, thought, of, as, the, reign, of, the, winter, spirits, these, needed, to, be, driven, out, in, order, for, summer, to, return, carnival, can, thus, be, regarded, as, a, rite, of, passage, from, darkness, to, light, from, winter, to, summer, a, fertility, celebration, the, first, spring, festival, of, the, new, year, several, germanic, tribes, celebrated, the, returning, of, the, daylight, winter, would, be, driven, out, to, make, sure, that, fertility, could, return, in, spring, a, central, figure, of, this, ritual, was, possibly, the, fertility, goddess, nerthus, also, there, are, some, indications, that, the, effigy, of, nerthus, or, freyr, was, placed, on, a, ship, with, wheels, and, accompanied, by, a, procession, of, people, in, animal, disguise, and, men, in, women, s, clothes, aboard, the, ship, a, marriage, would, be, consummated, as, a, fertility, ritual, tacitus, wrote, in, his, germania, germania, 9, 6, ceterum, nec, cohibere,

referred, to, a, period, following, epiphany, season, that, reached, its, climax, before, midnight, on, shrove, tuesday, british, historian, john, bossy, in, writing, on, the, origin, of, the, practices, during, carnival, states, that, these, were, despite, some, appearances, christian, in, character, and, they, were, medieval, in, origin, although, it, has, been, widely, supposed, that, they, continued, some, kind, of, pre, christian, cult, there, is, in, fact, no, evidence, that, they, existed, much, before, 1200, because, lent, was, a, period, of, fasting, carnival, therefore, represented, a, last, period, of, feasting, and, celebration, before, the, spiritual, rigors, of, lent, meat, was, plentiful, during, this, part, of, the, christian, calendar, and, it, was, consumed, during, carnival, as, people, abstained, from, meat, consumption, during, the, following, liturgical, season, lent, during, carnival, also, known, as, shrovetide, people, confessed, shrived, their, sins, in, preparation, for, lent, as, well, shakespeare, s, 1601, play, the, merchant, of, venice, scene, 5, of, act, 2, mentions, christians, who, painted, their, faces, to, celebrate, the, season,

casements, then, nor, thrust, your, head, into, the, public, street, to, gaze, on, christian, fools, with, varnish, d, faces, traditionally, a, carnival, feast, was, the, last, opportunity, for, common, people, to, eat, well, as, there, was, typically, a, food, shortage, at, the, end, of, the, winter, as, stores, ran, out, until, spring, produce, was, available, people, were, limited, to, the, minimum, necessary, meals, during, this, period, on, what, nowadays, is, called, vastenavond, the, days, before, fasting, all, the, remaining, winter, stores, of, lard, butter, and, meat, which, were, left, would, be, eaten, for, these, would, otherwise, soon, start, to, rot, and, decay, the, selected, livestock, had, already, been, slaughtered, in, november, and, the, meat, would, no, longer, be, preservable, all, the, food, that, had, survived, the, winter, had, to, be, eaten, to, assure, that, everyone, was, fed, enough, to, survive, until, the, coming, spring, would, provide, new, food, sources, traditionally, the, feast, also, was, a, time, to, indulge, in, sexual, desires, which, were, supposed, to, be, suppressed, during, the, following, period, fasting, before, lent, began, all, rich, food, and, drink, were, consumed, in, what, became, a, giant, celebration, that, involved, the, whole, community, and, is, thought, to, be, the, origin, of, carnival, in, many, christian, sermons, and, texts, the, example, of, a, vessel, is, used, to, explain, christian, doctrine, the, nave, of, the, church, of, baptism, the, ship, of, mary, etc, the, writings, show, that, processions, with, ship, like, carts, were, held, and, lavish, feasts, were, celebrated, on, the, eve, of, lent, or, the, greeting, of, spring, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, lenten, period, of, the, liturgical, calendar, the, six, weeks, directly, before, easter, was, historically, marked, by, fasting, study, and, other, pious, or, penitential, practices, during, lent, no, parties, or, celebrations, were, held, and, people, refrained, from, eating, rich, foods, such, as, meat, dairy, fat, and, sugar, the, first, three, classes, were, often, totally, unavailable, during, this, period, because, of, late, winter, shortages, while, christian, festivals, such, as, corpus, christi, were, church, sanctioned, celebrations, carnival, was, also, a, manifestation, of, european, folk, culture, in, the, christian, tradition, fasting, is, to, commemorate, the, 40, days, that, jesus, fasted, in, the, desert, according, to, the, new, testament, and, also, to, reflect, on, christian, values, it, was, a, time, for, catechumens, those, converting, to, christianity, to, prepare, for, baptism, at, easter, carnival, in, the, middle, ages, took, not, just, a, few, days, but, almost, the, entire, period, between, christmas, and, the, beginning, of, lent, in, those, two, months, christian, populations, used, their, several, holidays, as, an, outlet, for, their, daily, frustrations, many, synods, and, councils, attempted, to, set, things, right, caesarius, of, arles, 470, 542, protested, around, 500, ce, in, his, sermons, against, the, pagan, practices, centuries, later, his, statements, were, adapted, as, the, building, blocks, of, the, indiculus, superstitionum, et, paganiarum, small, index, of, superstitious, and, pagan, practices, which, was, drafted, by, the, synod, of, leptines, in, 742, it, condemned, the, spurcalibus, en, februario, pope, gregory, the, great, 590, 604, decided, that, fasting, would, start, on, ash, wednesday, the, whole, carnival, event, was, set, before, the, fasting, to, set, a, clear, division, between, celebrations, and, penitence, he, also, dispatched, missionaries, to, sanctify, any, excesses, in, popular, carnival, customs, it, was, also, the, custom, during, carnival, that, the, ruling, class, would, be, playfully, mocked, using, masks, and, disguises, in, the, year, 743, the, synod, in, leptines, located, near, binche, in, belgium, spoke, out, furiously, against, the, excesses, in, the, month, of, february, also, from, the, same, period, dates, the, phrase, whoever, in, february, by, a, variety, of, less, honorable, acts, tries, to, drive, out, winter, is, not, a, christian, but, a, pagan, confession, books, from, around, 800, contain, more, information, about, how, people, would, dress, as, an, animal, or, old, woman, during, the, festivities, in, january, and, february, even, though, this, was, a, sin, with, no, small, penance, also, in, spain, in, the, seventh, century, san, isidoro, de, sevilla, complained, in, his, writings, about, people, coming, out, into, the, streets, disguised, in, many, cases, as, the, opposite, sex, gradually, ecclesiastical, authority, began, to, realize, that, the, desired, result, could, not, be, achieved, by, banning, carnivals, which, eventually, led, to, a, degree, of, christianization, of, the, traditions, they, then, became, part, of, the, liturgy, and, the, liturgical, year, in, the, middle, ages, carnival, and, lent, were, both, necessary, inevitable, episodes, in, the, eternal, cycle, of, the, church, year, while, forming, an, integral, part, of, the, christian, calendar, particularly, in, catholic, regions, many, carnival, traditions, resemble, those, antedating, christianity, while, medieval, pageants, and, festivals, such, as, corpus, christi, were, church, sanctioned, carnival, was, also, a, manifestation, of, medieval, folk, culture, many, local, carnival, customs, are, claimed, to, derive, from, local, pre, christian, rituals, such, as, elaborate, rites, involving, masked, figures, in, the, swabian, alemannic, fastnacht, however, evidence, is, insufficient, to, establish, a, direct, origin, from, saturnalia, or, other, ancient, festivals, no, complete, accounts, of, saturnalia, survive, and, the, shared, features, of, feasting, role, reversals, temporary, social, equality, masks, and, permitted, rule, breaking, do, not, necessarily, constitute, a, coherent, festival, or, link, these, festivals, these, similarities, may, represent, a, reservoir, of, cultural, resources, that, can, embody, multiple, meanings, and, functions, for, example, easter, begins, with, the, resurrection, of, jesus, followed, by, a, liminal, period, and, ends, with, rebirth, carnival, reverses, this, as, king, carnival, comes, to, life, and, a, liminal, period, follows, before, his, death, both, feasts, are, calculated, by, the, lunar, calendar, both, jesus, and, king, carnival, may, be, seen, as, expiatory, figures, who, make, a, gift, to, the, people, with, their, deaths, in, the, case, of, jesus, the, gift, is, eternal, life, in, heaven, and, in, the, case, of, king, carnival, the, acknowledgement, that, death, is, a, necessary, part, of, the, cycle, of, life, besides, christian, anti, judaism, the, commonalities, between, church, and, carnival, rituals, and, imagery, suggest, a, common, root, in, early, christianity, christ, is, figured, as, the, victim, of, summary, judgment, and, is, tortured, and, executed, by, romans, before, a, jewish, mob, his, blood, is, on, us, and, on, our, children, matthew, 27, 24, 25, holy, week, processions, in, spain, include, crowds, who, vociferously, insult, the, figure, of, jesus, irreverence, parody, degradation, and, laughter, at, a, tragicomic, effigy, of, god, can, be, seen, as, intensifications, of, the, sacred, order, in, 1466, in, festivies, sponsored, by, pope, paul, ii, jews, were, forced, to, race, naked, through, the, streets, of, the, city, of, rome, clement, ix, stopped, these, practices, and, in, their, place, assessed, a, heavy, tax, on, the, jews, to, help, pay, for, the, costs, of, the, city, s, carnival, celebrations, some, of, the, best, known, traditions, including, carnal, parades, and, masquerade, balls, were, first, recorded, in, medieval, italy, the, carnival, of, venice, was, for, a, long, time, the, most, famous, carnival, although, napoleon, abolished, it, in, 1797, and, only, in, 1979, was, the, tradition, restored, from, italy, carnival, traditions, spread, to, spain, portugal, and, france, and, from, france, to, new, france, in, north, america, from, spain, and, portugal, it, spread, with, colonization, to, the, caribbean, and, latin, america, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, the, german, rhineland, and, southern, netherlands, the, weakened, medieval, tradition, also, revived, continuously, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, ce, as, part, of, the, annual, abuse, of, the, carnival, in, rome, rabbis, of, the, ghetto, were, forced, to, march, through, the, city, streets, wearing, foolish, guise, jeered, upon, and, pelted, by, a, variety, of, missiles, from, the, crowd, a, petition, of, the, jewish, community, of, rome, sent, in, 1836, to, pope, gregory, xvi, to, stop, the, annual, abuse, was, denied, it, is, not, opportune, to, make, any, innovation, in, the, rhineland, in, 1823, the, first, modern, carnival, parade, took, place, in, cologne, carnaval, karneval, fasching, or, fastnacht, in, germany, mixed, pagan, traditions, with, christian, traditions, pre, lenten, celebrations, featured, parades, costumes, and, masks, to, endure, lent, s, withdrawal, from, worldly, pleasures, other, areas, developed, their, own, traditions, in, the, united, kingdom, west, indian, immigrants, brought, with, them, the, traditions, of, caribbean, carnival, however, the, carnivals, now, celebrated, at, notting, hill, leeds, yorkshire, and, other, places, became, divorced, from, their, religious, origin, and, became, secular, events, that, take, place, in, the, summer, months, interpretations, of, carnival, present, it, as, a, social, institution, that, degrades, or, uncrowns, the, higher, functions, of, thought, speech, and, the, soul, by, translating, them, into, the, grotesque, body, which, serves, to, renew, society, and, the, world, as, a, release, for, impulses, that, threaten, the, social, order, that, ultimately, reinforces, social, norms, as, a, social, transformation, or, as, a, tool, for, different, groups, to, focus, attention, on, conflicts, and, incongruities, by, embodying, them, in, senseless, acts, furthermore, some, cultures, use, carnival, as, a, method, of, empowering, themselves, in, spite, of, social, conflicts, for, example, when, the, caribbean, carnival, was, established, as, a, result, of, french, settlers, even, the, slaves, had, their, version, of, the, masquerade, where, they, would, reverse, roles, to, mock, those, of, higher, social, status, along, with, empowering, individuals, for, a, period, of, time, despite, their, typical, status, carnival, brings, communities, together, in, a, day, where, all, are, meant, to, perform, a, mask, that, differs, from, their, typical, identity, all, members, of, a, society, are, able, to, connect, through, their, theatricality, and, satire, mircea, eliade, historian, of, religions, writes, any, new, year, is, a, revival, of, time, at, its, beginning, a, repetition, of, the, cosmogony, ritual, fights, between, two, groups, of, extras, the, presence, of, the, dead, saturnalia, and, orgies, are, all, elements, which, indicate, that, at, the, end, of, the, year, and, in, the, expectation, of, the, new, year, the, mythical, moments, of, the, passage, of, chaos, to, the, cosmogony, are, repeated, eliade, also, writes, then, the, dead, will, come, back, because, all, barriers, between, the, dead, and, the, living, are, broken, is, the, primordial, chaos, not, revived, and, will, come, back, since, at, this, paradoxical, moment, time, will, be, interrupted, so, that, the, dead, may, be, again, contemporaries, of, the, living, eliade, speculates, that, people, have, a, deep, need, to, regenerate, themselves, periodically, by, abolishing, the, elapsed, time, and, making, topical, the, cosmogony, as, regards, masks, monsters,
