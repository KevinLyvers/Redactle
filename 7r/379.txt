uto, aztecan, languages, are, a, family, of, indigenous, languages, of, the, americas, consisting, of, over, thirty, languages, uto, aztecan, languages, are, found, almost, entirely, in, the, western, united, states, and, mexico, the, name, of, the, language, family, reflects, the, common, ancestry, of, the, ute, language, of, utah, and, the, nahuan, languages, also, known, as, aztecan, of, mexico, the, uto, aztecan, language, family, is, one, of, the, largest, linguistic, families, in, the, americas, in, terms, of, number, of, speakers, number, of, languages, and, geographic, extension, the, northernmost, uto, aztecan, language, is, shoshoni, which, is, spoken, as, far, north, as, salmon, idaho, while, the, southernmost, is, the, pipil, language, of, el, salvador, and, honduras, ethnologue, gives, the, total, number, of, languages, in, the, family, as, 61, and, the, total, number, of, speakers, as, 1, 900, 412, speakers, of, nahuatl, languages, account, for, over, 85, of, these, the, internal, classification, of, the, family, often, divides, it, into, two, branches, a, northern, branch, including, all, the, languages, of, the, us, and, a, southern, branch, including, all, the, languages, of, mexico, although, it, is, still, being, discussed, whether, this, is, best, understood, as, a, genetic, classification, or, as, a, geographical, one, below, this, level, of, classification, the, main, branches, are, well, accepted, numic, including, languages, such, as, comanche, and, shoshoni, and, the, californian, languages, formerly, known, as, the, takic, group, including, cahuilla, and, luise, o, account, for, most, of, the, northern, languages, hopi, and, t, batulabal, are, languages, outside, those, groups, the, southern, languages, are, divided, into, the, tepiman, languages, including, o, odham, and, tepehu, n, the, tarahumaran, languages, including, raramuri, and, guarijio, the, cahitan, languages, including, yaqui, and, mayo, the, coracholan, languages, including, cora, and, huichol, and, the, nahuan, languages, the, homeland, of, the, uto, aztecan, languages, is, generally, considered, to, have, been, in, the, southwestern, united, states, or, possibly, northwestern, mexico, an, alternative, theory, has, proposed, the, possibility, that, the, language, family, originated, in, southern, mexico, within, the, mesoamerican, language, area, but, this, has, not, been, generally, considered, convincing, uto, aztecan, languages, are, spoken, in, the, north, american, mountain, ranges, and, adjacent, lowlands, of, the, western, united, states, in, the, states, of, oregon, idaho, montana, utah, california, nevada, and, arizona, in, mexico, they, are, spoken, in, the, states, of, sonora, sinaloa, chihuahua, nayarit, durango, zacatecas, jalisco, michoac, n, guerrero, san, luis, potos, hidalgo, puebla, veracruz, morelos, estado, de, m, xico, and, in, mexico, city, classical, nahuatl, the, language, of, the, aztecs, and, its, modern, relatives, are, part, of, the, uto, aztecan, family, the, pipil, language, an, offshoot, of, nahuatl, spread, to, central, america, by, a, wave, of, migration, from, mexico, and, formerly, had, many, speakers, there, now, it, has, gone, extinct, in, guatemala, honduras, and, nicaragua, and, it, is, nearly, extinct, in, western, el, salvador, all, areas, dominated, by, use, of, spanish, uto, aztecan, has, been, accepted, by, linguists, as, a, language, family, since, the, early, 1900s, and, six, subgroups, are, generally, accepted, as, valid, numic, takic, pimic, taracahitic, corachol, and, aztecan, that, leaves, two, ungrouped, languages, t, batulabal, and, hopi, sometimes, termed, isolates, within, the, family, some, recent, studies, have, begun, to, question, the, unity, of, taracahitic, and, takic, and, computer, assisted, statistical, studies, have, begun, to, question, some, of, the, long, held, assumptions, and, consensuses, as, to, higher, level, groupings, disagreement, has, persisted, since, the, 19th, century, presently, scholars, also, disagree, as, to, where, to, draw, language, boundaries, within, the, dialect, continua, the, similarities, among, the, uto, aztecan, languages, were, noted, as, early, as, 1859, by, j, c, e, buschmann, but, he, failed, to, recognize, the, genetic, affiliation, between, the, aztecan, branch, and, the, rest, he, ascribed, the, similarities, between, the, two, groups, to, diffusion, daniel, garrison, brinton, added, the, aztecan, languages, to, the, family, in, 1891, and, coined, the, term, uto, aztecan, john, wesley, powell, however, rejected, the, claim, in, his, own, classification, of, north, american, indigenous, languages, also, published, in, 1891, powell, recognized, two, language, families, shoshonean, encompassing, takic, numic, hopi, and, t, batulabal, and, sonoran, encompassing, pimic, taracahitan, and, corachol, in, the, early, 1900s, alfred, l, kroeber, filled, in, the, picture, of, the, shoshonean, group, while, edward, sapir, proved, the, unity, among, aztecan, sonoran, and, shoshonean, sapir, s, applications, of, the, comparative, method, to, unwritten, native, american, languages, are, regarded, as, groundbreaking, voegelin, voegelin, hale, 1962, argued, for, a, three, way, division, of, shoshonean, sonoran, and, aztecan, following, powell, as, of, about, 2011, there, is, still, debate, about, whether, to, accept, the, proposed, basic, split, between, northern, uto, aztecan, and, southern, uto, aztecan, languages, northern, uto, aztecan, corresponds, to, powell, s, shoshonean, and, the, latter, is, all, the, rest, powell, s, sonoran, plus, aztecan, northern, uto, aztecan, was, proposed, as, a, genetic, grouping, by, jeffrey, heath, in, heath, 1978, based, on, morphological, evidence, and, alexis, manaster, ramer, in, manaster, ramer, 1992, adduced, phonological, evidence, in, the, form, of, a, sound, law, terrence, kaufman, in, kaufman, 1981, accepted, the, basic, division, into, northern, and, southern, branches, as, valid, other, scholars, have, rejected, the, genealogical, unity, of, either, both, nodes, or, the, northern, node, alone, wick, r, miller, s, argument, was, statistical, arguing, that, northern, uto, aztecan, languages, displayed, too, few, cognates, to, be, considered, a, unit, on, the, other, hands, he, found, the, number, of, cognates, among, southern, uto, aztecan, languages, to, suggest, a, genetic, relation, this, position, was, supported, by, subsequent, lexicostatistic, analyses, by, cortina, borja, vali, as, coalla, 1989, and, cortina, borja, stuart, smith, vali, as, coalla, 2002, reviewing, the, debate, haugen, 2008, considers, the, evidence, in, favor, of, the, genetic, unity, of, northern, uto, aztecan, to, be, convincing, but, remains, agnostic, on, the, validity, of, southern, uto, aztecan, as, a, genetic, grouping, hill, 2011, also, considered, the, north, south, split, to, be, valid, based, on, phonological, evidence, confirming, both, groupings, merrill, 2013, adduced, further, evidence, for, the, unity, of, southern, uto, aztecan, as, a, valid, grouping, hill, 2011, also, rejected, the, validity, of, the, takic, grouping, decomposing, it, into, a, californian, areal, grouping, together, with, tubatulabal, some, classifications, have, posited, a, genetic, relation, between, corachol, and, nahuan, e, g, merrill, 2013, kaufman, recognizes, similarities, between, corachol, and, aztecan, but, explains, them, by, diffusion, instead, of, genetic, evolution, most, scholars, view, the, breakup, of, proto, uto, aztecan, as, a, case, of, the, gradual, disintegration, of, a, dialect, continuum, below, is, a, representation, of, the, internal, classification, of, the, language, family, based, on, shaul, 2014, the, classification, reflects, the, decision, to, split, up, the, previous, taracahitic, and, takic, groups, that, are, no, longer, considered, to, be, valid, genetic, units, whether, the, division, between, northern, and, southern, languages, is, best, understood, as, geographical, or, phylogenetic, is, under, discussion, the, table, contains, demographic, information, about, number, of, speakers, and, their, locations, based, on, data, from, the, ethnologue, the, table, also, contains, links, to, a, selected, bibliography, of, grammars, dictionaries, on, many, of, the, individual, languages, extinct, in, addition, to, the, above, languages, for, which, linguistic, evidence, exists, it, is, suspected, that, among, dozens, of, now, extinct, undocumented, or, poorly, known, languages, of, northern, mexico, many, were, uto, aztecan, a, large, number, of, languages, known, only, from, brief, mentions, are, thought, to, have, been, uto, aztecan, languages, that, became, extinct, before, being, documented, an, aztec, tanoan, macrofamily, that, unites, the, uto, aztecan, languages, with, the, tanoan, languages, of, the, southwestern, united, states, was, first, proposed, by, edward, sapir, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, later, supported, with, potential, lexical, evidence, by, other, scholars, this, proposal, has, received, much, criticism, about, the, validity, of, the, proposed, cognate, sets, and, has, been, largely, abandoned, since, the, end, of, the, last, century, as, unproven
