bring, together, police, from, various, german, speaking, states, its, activities, were, centered, mostly, on, political, dissidents, and, criminals, a, similar, plan, was, launched, by, italy, in, the, 1898, anti, anarchist, conference, of, rome, which, brought, delegates, from, 21, european, countries, to, create, a, formal, structure, for, addressing, the, international, anarchist, movement,
