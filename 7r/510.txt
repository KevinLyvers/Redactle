the, writings, of, saul, of, tarsus, e, g, for, why, should, my, freedom, be, judged, by, another, s, conscience, 1, corinthians, 10, 29, although, greek, philosophers, plato, and, socrates, had, discussed, freedom, of, thought, minimally, the, edicts, of, king, ashoka, 3rd, century, bc, have, been, called, the, first, decree, respecting, freedom, of, conscience, in, european, tradition,

vinet, and, john, stuart, mill, and, the, theologians, roger, williams, and, samuel, rutherford, have, been, considered, major, proponents, of, the, idea, of, freedom, of, conscience, or, soul, liberty, in, the, words, of, williams, queen, elizabeth, i, revoked, a, thought, censorship, law, in, the, late, sixteenth, century, because, according, to, sir, francis, bacon, she, did, not, to, make, windows, into, men, s, souls, and, secret, thoughts, during, her, reign, however, a, number, of, books, published, by, theorist, giordano, bruno, spurred, controversy, mentioning, topics,

of, expression, can, be, limited, through, censorship, arrests, book, burning, or, propaganda, and, this, tends, to, discourage, freedom, of, thought, examples, of, effective, campaigns, against,
