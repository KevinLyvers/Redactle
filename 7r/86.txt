years, as, the, ease, and, speed, of, exchanging, stocks, over, digital, platforms, has, increased, volatility, in, the, day, to, day, market, has, increased, too, the, beginnings, of, lending, were, in, italy, in, the, late, middle, ages, in, the, 14th, century, venetian, lenders, would, carry, slates, with, information, on, the, various, issues, for, sale, and, meet, with, clients, much, like, a, broker, does, today, venetian, merchants, introduced, the, principle, of, exchanging, debts, between, moneylenders, a, lender, looking, to, unload, a, high, risk, high, interest, loan, might, exchange, it, for, a, different, loan, with, another, lender, these, lenders, also, bought, government, debt, issues, as, the, natural, evolution, of, their, business, continued, the, lenders, began, to, sell, debt, issues, to, the, first, individual, investors, the, venetians, were, the, leaders, in, the, field, and, the, first, to, start, trading, securities, from, other, governments, yet, did, not, embark, on, private, trade, with, india, nor, did, the, italians, connect, on, land, with, the, chinese, silk, road, along, the, potential, overland, trade, route, habsburg, austrian, emperor, frederick, ii, repulsed, advances, by, mongol, batu, kahn, golden, horde, in, 1241, there, is, little, consensus, among, scholars, as, to, when, corporate, stock, was, first, traded, some, view, the, key, event, as, the, dutch, east, india, company, s, founding, in, 1602, while, others, point, to, much, earlier, developments, bruges, antwerp, in, 1531, and, in, lyon, in, 1548, the, first, book, in, history, of, securities, exchange, the, confusion, of, confusions, was, written, by, the, dutch, jewish, trader, joseph, de, la, vega, and, the, amsterdam, stock, exchange, is, often, considered, the, oldest, modern, securities, market, in, the, world, on, the, other, hand, economist, ulrike, malmendier, of, the, university, of, california, at, berkeley, argues, that, a, share, market, existed, as, far, back, as, ancient, rome, that, derives, from, etruscan, argentari, in, the, roman, republic, which, existed, for, centuries, before, the, empire, was, founded, there, were, societates, publicanorum, organizations, of, contractors, or, leaseholders, who, performed, temple, building, and, other, services, for, the, government, one, such, service, was, the, feeding, of, geese, on, the, capitoline, hill, as, a, reward, to, the, birds, after, their, honking, warned, of, a, gallic, invasion, in, 390, b, c, participants, in, such, organizations, had, partes, or, shares, a, concept, mentioned, various, times, by, the, statesman, and, orator, cicero, in, one, speech, cicero, mentions, shares, that, had, a, very, high, price, at, the, time, such, evidence, in, malmendier, s, view, suggests, the, instruments, were, tradable, with, fluctuating, values, based, on, an, organization, s, success, the, societas, declined, into, obscurity, in, the, time, of, the, emperors, as, most, of, their, services, were, taken, over, by, direct, agents, of, the, state, tradable, bonds, as, a, commonly, used, type, of, security, were, a, more, recent, innovation, spearheaded, by, the, italian, city, states, of, the, late, medieval, and, early, renaissance, periods, joseph, de, la, vega, also, known, as, joseph, penso, de, la, vega, and, by, other, variations, of, his, name, was, an, amsterdam, trader, from, a, spanish, jewish, family, and, a, prolific, writer, as, well, as, a, successful, businessman, in, 17th, century, amsterdam, his, 1688, book, confusion, of, confusions, explained, the, workings, of, the, city, s, stock, market, it, was, the, earliest, book, about, stock, trading, and, inner, workings, of, a, stock, market, taking, the, form, of, a, dialogue, between, a, merchant, a, shareholder, and, a, philosopher, the, book, described, a, market, that, was, sophisticated, but, also, prone, to, excesses, and, de, la, vega, offered, advice, to, his, readers, on, such, topics, as, the, unpredictability, of, market, shifts, and, the, importance, of, patience, in, investment, in, england, the, dutch, king, william, iii, sought, to, modernize, the, kingdom, s, finances, to, pay, for, its, wars, and, thus, the, first, government, bonds, were, issued, in, 1693, and, the, bank, of, england, was, set, up, the, following, year, soon, thereafter, english, joint, stock, companies, began, going, public, london, s, first, stockbrokers, however, were, barred, from, the, old, commercial, center, known, as, the, royal, exchange, reportedly, because, of, their, rude, manners, instead, the, new, trade, was, conducted, from, coffee, houses, along, exchange, alley, by, 1698, a, broker, named, john, castaing, operating, out, of, jonathan, s, coffee, house, was, posting, regular, lists, of, stock, and, commodity, prices, those, lists, mark, the, beginning, of, the, london, stock, exchange, one, of, history, s, greatest, financial, bubbles, occurred, around, 1720, at, the, center, of, it, were, the, south, sea, company, set, up, in, 1711, to, conduct, english, trade, with, south, america, and, the, mississippi, company, focused, on, commerce, with, france, s, louisiana, colony, and, touted, by, transplanted, scottish, financier, john, law, who, was, acting, in, effect, as, france, s, central, banker, investors, snapped, up, shares, in, both, and, whatever, else, was, available, in, 1720, at, the, height, of, the, mania, there, was, even, an, offering, of, a, company, for, carrying, out, an, undertaking, of, great, advantage, but, nobody, to, know, what, it, is, by, the, end, of, that, same, year, share, prices, had, started, collapsing, as, it, became, clear, that, expectations, of, imminent, wealth, from, the, americas, were, overblown, in, london, parliament, passed, the, bubble, act, which, stated, that, only, royally, chartered, companies, could, issue, public, shares, in, paris, law, was, stripped, of, office, and, fled, the, country, stock, trading, was, more, limited, and, subdued, in, subsequent, decades, yet, the, market, survived, and, by, the, 1790s, shares, were, being, traded, in, the, young, united, states, on, may, 17, 1792, the, new, york, stock, exchange, opened, under, a, platanus, occidentalis, buttonwood, tree, in, new, york, city, as, 24, stockbrokers, signed, the, buttonwood, agreement, agreeing, to, trade, five, securities, under, that, buttonwood, tree, bombay, stock, exchange, was, started, by, premchand, roychand, in, 1875, while, bse, limited, is, now, synonymous, with, dalal, street, it, was, not, always, so, in, the, 1850s, five, stock, brokers, gathered, together, under, a, banyan, tree, in, front, of, mumbai, town, hall, where, horniman, circle, is, now, situated, a, decade, later, the, brokers, moved, their, location, to, another, leafy, setting, this, time, under, banyan, trees, at, the, junction, of, meadows, street, and, what, was, then, called, esplanade, road, now, mahatma, gandhi, road, with, a, rapid, increase, in, the, number, of, brokers, they, had, to, shift, places, repeatedly, at, last, in, 1874, the, brokers, found, a, permanent, location, the, one, that, they, could, call, their, own, the, brokers, group, became, an, official, organization, known, as, the, native, share, stock, brokers, association, in, 1875, the, bombay, stock, exchange, continued, to, operate, out, of, a, building, near, the, town, hall, until, 1928, the, present, site, near, horniman, circle, was, acquired, by, the, exchange, in, 1928, and, a, building, was, constructed, and, occupied, in, 1930, the, street, on, which, the, site, is, located, came, to, be, called, dalal, street, in, hindi, meaning, broker, street, due, to, the, location, of, the, exchange, on, 31, august, 1957, the, bse, became, the, first, stock, exchange, to, be, recognized, by, the, indian, government, under, the, securities, contracts, regulation, act, construction, of, the, present, building, the, phiroze, jeejeebhoy, towers, at, dalal, street, fort, area, began, in, the, late, 1970s, and, was, completed, and, occupied, by, the, bse, in, 1980, initially, named, the, bse, towers, the, name, of, the, building, was, changed, soon, after, occupation, in, memory, of, sir, phiroze, jamshedji, jeejeebhoy, chairman, of, the, bse, since, 1966, following, his, death, in, 1986, the, bse, developed, the, s, p, bse, sensex, index, giving, the, bse, a, means, to, measure, the, overall, performance, of, the, exchange, in, 2000, the, bse, used, this, index, to, open, its, derivatives, market, trading, s, p, bse, sensex, futures, contracts, the, development, of, s, p, bse, sensex, options, along, with, equity, derivatives, followed, in, 2001, and, 2002, expanding, the, bse, s, trading, platform, historically, an, open, outcry, floor, trading, exchange, the, bombay, stock, exchange, switched, to, an, electronic, trading, system, developed, by, cmc, ltd, in, 1995, it, took, the, exchange, only, 50, days, to, make, this, transition, this, automated, screen, based, trading, platform, called, bse, on, line, trading, bolt, had, a, capacity, of, 8, million, orders, per, day, now, bse, has, raised, capital, by, issuing, shares, and, as, on, 3, may, 2017, the, bse, share, which, is, traded, in, nse, only, closed, with, 999, stock, exchanges, have, multiple, roles, in, the, economy, this, may, include, the, following, besides, the, borrowing, capacity, provided, to, an, individual, or, firm, by, the, banking, system, in, the, form, of, credit, or, a, loan, a, stock, exchange, provides, companies, with, the, facility, to, raise, capital, for, expansion, through, selling, shares, to, the, investing, public, capital, intensive, companies, particularly, high, tech, companies, typically, need, to, raise, high, volumes, of, capital, in, their, early, stages, for, this, reason, the, public, market, provided, by, the, stock, exchanges, has, been, one, of, the, most, important, funding, sources, for, many, capital, intensive, startups, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, hi, tech, listed, companies, experienced, a, boom, and, bust, in, the, world, s, major, stock, exchanges, since, then, it, has, been, much, more, demanding, for, the, high, tech, entrepreneur, to, take, his, her, company, public, unless, either, the, company, is, already, generating, sales, and, earnings, or, the, company, has, demonstrated, credibility, and, potential, from, successful, outcomes, clinical, trials, market, research, patent, registrations, etc, this, shift, in, market, expectations, has, led, to, an, increased, reliance, on, private, equity, and, venture, capital, funding, in, the, early, stages, of, high, tech, companies, this, is, quite, different, from, the, situation, of, the, 1990s, to, early, 2000s, period, when, a, number, of, companies, particularly, internet, boom, and, biotechnology, companies, went, public, in, the, most, prominent, stock, exchanges, around, the, world, in, the, total, absence, of, sales, earnings, or, any, type, of, well, documented, promising, outcome, though, it, is, not, as, common, it, still, happens, that, highly, speculative, and, financially, unpredictable, hi, tech, startups, are, listed, for, the, first, time, in, a, major, stock, exchange, additionally, there, are, smaller, specialized, entry, markets, for, these, kind, of, companies, with, stock, indexes, tracking, their, performance, examples, include, the, alternext, cac, small, sdax, tecdax, alternative, investment, funds, refer, to, funds, that, include, hedge, funds, venture, capital, private, equity, angel, funds, real, estate, commodities, collectibles, structured, products, etc, alternative, investment, funds, are, an, alternative, to, traditional, investment, options, stocks, bonds, and, cash, companies, have, also, raised, significant, amounts, of, capital, through, r, d, limited, partnerships, tax, law, changes, that, were, enacted, in, 1987, in, the, united, states, changed, the, tax, deductibility, of, investments, in, r, d, limited, partnerships, in, order, for, a, partnership, to, be, of, interest, to, investors, today, the, cash, on, cash, return, must, be, high, enough, to, entice, investors, a, general, source, of, capital, for, startup, companies, has, been, venture, capital, this, source, remains, largely, available, today, but, the, maximum, statistical, amount, that, the, venture, company, firms, in, aggregate, will, invest, in, any, one, company, is, not, limitless, it, was, approximately, 15, million, in, 2001, for, a, biotechnology, company, another, alternative, source, of, cash, for, a, private, company, is, a, corporate, partner, usually, an, established, multinational, company, which, provides, capital, for, the, smaller, company, in, return, for, marketing, rights, patent, rights, or, equity, corporate, partnerships, have, been, used, successfully, in, a, large, number, of, cases, when, people, draw, their, savings, and, invest, in, shares, through, an, initial, public, offering, or, the, seasoned, equity, offering, of, an, already, listed, company, it, usually, leads, to, rational, allocation, of, resources, because, funds, which, could, have, been, consumed, or, kept, in, idle, deposits, with, banks, are, mobilized, and, redirected, to, help, companies, management, boards, finance, their, organizations, this, may, promote, business, activity, with, benefits, for, several, economic, sectors, such, as, agriculture, commerce, and, industry, resulting, in, stronger, economic, growth, and, higher, productivity, levels, of, firms, companies, view, acquisitions, as, an, opportunity, to, expand, product, lines, increase, distribution, channels, hedge, against, volatility, increase, their, market, share, or, acquire, other, necessary, business, assets, a, takeover, bid, or, mergers, and, acquisitions, through, the, stock, market, is, one, of, the, simplest, and, most, common, ways, for, a, company, to, grow, by, acquisition, or, fusion, by, going, public, and, listing, on, a, stock, exchange, companies, gain, access, to, a, broader, pool, of, investors, which, can, provide, the, necessary, funds, for, expansion, research, and, development, and, other, growth, initiatives, additionally, being, listed, on, a, stock, exchange, enhances, a, company, s, visibility, and, credibility, making, it, more, attractive, to, potential, partners, customers, and, employees, according, to, a, report, by, the, world, federation, of, exchanges, wfe, stock, exchanges, contribute, to, economic, growth, by, enabling, companies, to, access, long, term, capital, thereby, fostering, innovation, and, job, creation, while, stock, exchanges, are, not, designed, to, be, platforms, for, the, redistribution, of, wealth, they, play, a, significant, role, in, allowing, both, casual, and, professional, stock, investors, to, partake, in, the, wealth, generated, by, profitable, businesses, this, is, achieved, through, the, distribution, of, dividends, and, the, potential, for, stock, price, increases, leading, to, capital, gains, as, a, result, individuals, who, invest, in, stocks, have, the, opportunity, to, share, in, the, prosperity, of, successful, companies, effectively, participating, in, a, form, of, wealth, redistribution, through, their, investment, activities, thus, while, not, the, primary, purpose, of, stock, exchanges, the, opportunity, for, individuals, to, benefit, from, the, success, of, businesses, can, be, seen, as, a, form, of, wealth, redistribution, within, the, financial, markets, both, casual, and, professional, stock, investors, as, large, as, institutional, investors, or, as, small, as, an, ordinary, middle, class, family, through, dividends, and, stock, price, increases, that, may, result, in, capital, gains, share, in, the, wealth, of, profitable, businesses, unprofitable, and, troubled, businesses, may, result, in, capital, losses, for, shareholders, by, having, a, wide, and, varied, scope, of, owners, companies, generally, tend, to, improve, management, standards, and, efficiency, to, satisfy, the, demands, of, these, shareholders, and, the, more, stringent, rules, for, public, corporations, imposed, by, public, stock, exchanges, and, the, government, this, improvement, can, be, attributed, in, some, cases, to, the, price, mechanism, exerted, through, shares, of, stock, wherein, the, price, of, the, stock, falls, when, management, is, considered, poor, making, the, firm, vulnerable, to, a, takeover, by, new, management, or, rises, when, management, is, doing, well, making, the, firm, less, vulnerable, to, a, takeover, in, addition, publicly, listed, shares, are, subject, to, greater, transparency, so, that, investors, can, make, informed, decisions, about, a, purchase, consequently, it, is, alleged, that, public, companies, companies, that, are, owned, by, shareholders, who, are, members, of, the, general, public, and, trade, shares, on, public, exchanges, tend, to, have, better, management, records, than, privately, held, companies, those, companies, where, shares, are, not, publicly, traded, often, owned, by, the, company, founders, their, families, and, heirs, or, otherwise, by, a, small, group, of, investors, despite, this, claim, some, well, documented, cases, are, known, where, it, is, alleged, that, there, has, been, considerable, slippage, in, corporate, governance, on, the, part, of, some, public, companies, particularly, in, the, cases, of, accounting, scandals, the, policies, that, led, to, the, dot, com, bubble, in, the, late, 1990s, and, the, subprime, mortgage, crisis, in, 2007, 08, are, also, examples, of, corporate, mismanagement, the, mismanagement, of, companies, such, as, pets, com, 2000, enron, 2001, one, tel, 2001, sunbeam, products, 2001, webvan, 2001, adelphia, communications, corporation, 2002, mci, worldcom, 2002, parmalat, 2003, american, international, group, 2008, bear, stearns, 2008, lehman, brothers, 2008, general, motors, 2009, and, satyam, computer, services, 2009, all, received, plenty, of, media, attention, many, banks, and, companies, worldwide, utilize, securities, identification, numbers, isin, to, identify, uniquely, their, stocks, bonds, and, other, securities, adding, an, isin, code, helps, to, distinctly, identify, securities, and, the, isin, system, is, used, worldwide, by, funds, companies, and, governments, however, when, poor, financial, ethical, or, managerial, records, become, public, stock, investors, tend, to, lose, money, as, the, stock, and, the, company, tend, to, lose, value, in, the, stock, exchanges, shareholders, of, underperforming, firms, are, often, penalized, by, significant, share, price, decline, and, they, tend, as, well, to, dismiss, incompetent, management, teams, as, opposed, to, other, businesses, that, require, huge, capital, outlay, investing, in, shares, is, open, to, both, the, large, and, small, stock, investors, as, minimum, investment, amounts, are, minimal, therefore, the, stock, exchange, provides, the, opportunity, for, small, investors, to, own, shares, of, the, same, companies, as, large, investors, governments, at, various, levels, may, decide, to, borrow, money, to, finance, infrastructure, projects, such, as, sewage, and, water, treatment, works, or, housing, estates, by, selling, another, category, of, securities, known, as, bonds, these, bonds, can, be, raised, through, the, stock, exchange, whereby, members, of, the, public, buy, them, thus, loaning, money, to, the, government, the, issuance, of, such, bonds, can, obviate, in, the, short, term, direct, taxation, of, citizens, to, finance, development, though, by, securing, such, bonds, with, the, full, faith, and, credit, of, the, government, instead, of, with, collateral, the, government, must, eventually, tax, citizens, or, otherwise, raise, additional, funds, to, make, any, regular, coupon, payments, and, refund, the, principal, when, the, bonds, mature, at, the, stock, exchange, share, prices, rise, and, decreases, depending, largely, on, economic, forces, share, prices, tend, to, rise, or, remain, stable, when, companies, and, the, economy, in, general, show, signs, of, stability, and, growth, a, recession, depression, or, financial, crisis, could, eventually, lead, to, a, stock, market, crash, therefore, the, movement, of, share, prices, and, in, general, of, the, stock, indexes, can, be, an, indicator, of, the, general, trend, in, the, economy, stock, exchanges, offer, employment, opportunities, to, various, individuals, such, as, jobbers, and, other, members, who, perform, activities, within, the, stock, exchange, this, makes, the, stock, exchange, a, source, of, employment, not, only, for, investors, but, also, for, the, members, and, their, employees, the, diverse, range, of, roles, within, the, stock, exchange, including, trading, analysis, compliance, and, administrative, functions, creates, an, ecosystem, of, employment, opportunities, that, support, the, operations, and, functions, of, the, exchange, additionally, the, stock, exchange, s, role, in, facilitating, capital, formation, and, investment, in, businesses, also, indirectly, contributes, to, job, creation, and, economic, growth, making, it, a, significant, player, in, the, employment, landscape, the, stock, exchange, plays, a, role, in, regulating, companies, by, exerting, a, significant, influence, on, their, management, practices, to, be, listed, on, a, stock, exchange, a, company, is, required, to, adhere, to, a, set, of, rules, and, regulations, established, by, the, exchange, itself, these, regulations, serve, as, a, framework, for, corporate, governance, financial, transparency, and, accountability, thereby, ensuring, that, listed, companies, operate, in, a, manner, that, is, conducive, to, investor, confidence, and, market, stability, by, imposing, these, standards, stock, exchanges, contribute, to, the, overall, integrity, and, reliability, of, the, financial, markets, fostering, an, environment, where, companies, are, held, accountable, for, their, actions, and, decisions, ultimately, benefiting, both, investors, and, the, broader, economy, each, stock, exchange, imposes, its, own, listing, requirements, upon, companies, that, want, to, be, listed, on, that, exchange, such, conditions, may, include, minimum, number, of, shares, outstanding, minimum, market, capitalization, and, minimum, annual, income, the, listing, requirements, imposed, by, some, stock, exchanges, include, stock, exchanges, originated, as, mutual, organizations, owned, by, its, member, stockbrokers, however, the, major, stock, exchanges, have, demutualized, where, the, members, sell, their, shares, in, an, initial, public, offering, in, this, way, the, mutual, organization, becomes, a, corporation, with, shares, that, are, listed, on, a, stock, exchange, examples, are, australian, securities, exchange, 1998, euronext, merged, with, new, york, stock, exchange, nasdaq, 2002, bursa, malaysia, 2004, the, new, york, stock, exchange, 2005, bolsas, y, mercados, espa, oles, and, the, s, o, paulo, stock, exchange, 2007, the, shenzhen, stock, exchange, and, shanghai, stock, exchange, can, be, characterized, as, quasi, state, institutions, insofar, as, they, were, created, by, government, bodies, in, china, and, their, leading, personnel, are, directly, appointed, by, the, china, securities, regulatory, commission, another, example, is, tashkent, stock, exchange, established, in, 1994, three, years, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, mainly, state, owned, but, has, a, form, of, a, public, corporation, joint, stock, company, korea, exchange, krx, owns, 25, less, one, share, of, the, tashkent, stock, exchange, in, 2018, there, were, 15, licensed, stock, exchanges, in, the, united, states, of, which, 13, actively, traded, securities, all, of, these, exchanges, were, owned, by, three,
