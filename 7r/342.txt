speech, is, the, use, of, the, human, voice, as, a, medium, for, language, spoken, language, combines, vowel, and, consonant, sounds, to, form, units, of, meaning, like, words, which, belong, to, a, language, s, lexicon, there, are, many, different, intentional, speech, acts, such, as, informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, acts, may, vary, in, various, aspects, like, enunciation, intonation, loudness, and, tempo, to, convey, meaning, individuals, may, also, unintentionally, communicate, aspects, of, their, social, position, through, speech, such, as, sex, age, place, of, origin, physiological, and, mental, condition, education, and, experiences, while, normally, used, to, facilitate, communication, with, others, people, may, also, use, speech, without, the, intent, to, communicate, speech, may, nevertheless, express, emotions, or, desires, people, talk, to, themselves, sometimes, in, acts, that, are, a, development, of, what, some, psychologists, e, g, lev, vygotsky, have, maintained, is, the, use, of, silent, speech, in, an, interior, monologue, to, vivify, and, organize, cognition, sometimes, in, the, momentary, adoption, of, a, dual, persona, as, self, addressing, self, as, though, addressing, another, person, solo, speech, can, be, used, to, memorize, or, to, test, one, s, memorization, of, things, and, in, prayer, or, in, meditation, researchers, study, many, different, aspects, of, speech, speech, production, and, speech, perception, of, the, sounds, used, in, a, language, speech, repetition, speech, errors, the, ability, to, map, heard, spoken, words, onto, the, vocalizations, needed, to, recreate, them, which, plays, a, key, role, in, children, s, enlargement, of, their, vocabulary, and, what, different, areas, of, the, human, brain, such, as, broca, s, area, and, wernicke, s, area, underlie, speech, speech, is, the, subject, of, study, for, linguistics, cognitive, science, communication, studies, psychology, computer, science, speech, pathology, otolaryngology, and, acoustics, speech, compares, with, written, language, which, may, differ, in, its, vocabulary, syntax, and, phonetics, from, the, spoken, language, a, situation, called, diglossia, the, evolutionary, origin, of, speech, is, subject, to, debate, and, speculation, while, animals, also, communicate, using, vocalizations, and, trained, apes, such, as, washoe, and, kanzi, can, use, simple, sign, language, no, animals, vocalizations, are, articulated, phonemically, and, syntactically, and, do, not, constitute, speech, although, related, to, the, more, general, problem, of, the, origin, of, language, the, evolution, of, distinctively, human, speech, capacities, has, become, a, distinct, and, in, many, ways, separate, area, of, scientific, research, the, topic, is, a, separate, one, because, language, is, not, necessarily, spoken, it, can, equally, be, written, or, signed, speech, is, in, this, sense, optional, although, it, is, the, default, modality, for, language, monkeys, non, human, apes, and, humans, like, many, other, animals, have, evolved, specialised, mechanisms, for, producing, sound, for, purposes, of, social, communication, on, the, other, hand, no, monkey, or, ape, uses, its, tongue, for, such, purposes, the, human, species, unprecedented, use, of, the, tongue, lips, and, other, moveable, parts, seems, to, place, speech, in, a, quite, separate, category, making, its, evolutionary, emergence, an, intriguing, theoretical, challenge, in, the, eyes, of, many, scholars, determining, the, timeline, of, human, speech, evolution, is, made, additionally, challenging, by, the, lack, of, data, in, the, fossil, record, the, human, vocal, tract, does, not, fossilize, and, indirect, evidence, of, vocal, tract, changes, in, hominid, fossils, has, proven, inconclusive, speech, production, is, an, unconscious, multi, step, process, by, which, thoughts, are, generated, into, spoken, utterances, production, involves, the, unconscious, mind, selecting, appropriate, words, and, the, appropriate, form, of, those, words, from, the, lexicon, and, morphology, and, the, organization, of, those, words, through, the, syntax, then, the, phonetic, properties, of, the, words, are, retrieved, and, the, sentence, is, articulated, through, the, articulations, associated, with, those, phonetic, properties, in, linguistics, articulatory, phonetics, is, the, study, of, how, the, tongue, lips, jaw, vocal, cords, and, other, speech, organs, are, used, to, make, sounds, speech, sounds, are, categorized, by, manner, of, articulation, and, place, of, articulation, place, of, articulation, refers, to, where, in, the, neck, or, mouth, the, airstream, is, constricted, manner, of, articulation, refers, to, the, manner, in, which, the, speech, organs, interact, such, as, how, closely, the, air, is, restricted, what, form, of, airstream, is, used, e, g, pulmonic, implosive, ejectives, and, clicks, whether, or, not, the, vocal, cords, are, vibrating, and, whether, the, nasal, cavity, is, opened, to, the, airstream, the, concept, is, primarily, used, for, the, production, of, consonants, but, can, be, used, for, vowels, in, qualities, such, as, voicing, and, nasalization, for, any, place, of, articulation, there, may, be, several, manners, of, articulation, and, therefore, several, homorganic, consonants, normal, human, speech, is, pulmonic, produced, with, pressure, from, the, lungs, which, creates, phonation, in, the, glottis, in, the, larynx, which, is, then, modified, by, the, vocal, tract, and, mouth, into, different, vowels, and, consonants, however, humans, can, pronounce, words, without, the, use, of, the, lungs, and, glottis, in, alaryngeal, speech, of, which, there, are, three, types, esophageal, speech, pharyngeal, speech, and, buccal, speech, better, known, as, donald, duck, talk, speech, production, is, a, complex, activity, and, as, a, consequence, errors, are, common, especially, in, children, speech, errors, come, in, many, forms, and, are, used, to, provide, evidence, to, support, hypotheses, about, the, nature, of, speech, as, a, result, speech, errors, are, often, used, in, the, construction, of, models, for, language, production, and, child, language, acquisition, for, example, the, fact, that, children, often, make, the, error, of, over, regularizing, the, ed, past, tense, suffix, in, english, e, g, saying, singed, instead, of, sang, shows, that, the, regular, forms, are, acquired, earlier, speech, errors, associated, with, certain, kinds, of, aphasia, have, been, used, to, map, certain, components, of, speech, onto, the, brain, and, see, the, relation, between, different, aspects, of, production, for, example, the, difficulty, of, expressive, aphasia, patients, in, producing, regular, past, tense, verbs, but, not, irregulars, like, sing, sang, has, been, used, to, demonstrate, that, regular, inflected, forms, of, a, word, are, not, individually, stored, in, the, lexicon, but, produced, from, affixation, to, the, base, form, speech, perception, refers, to, the, processes, by, which, humans, can, interpret, and, understand, the, sounds, used, in, language, the, study, of, speech, perception, is, closely, linked, to, the, fields, of, phonetics, and, phonology, in, linguistics, and, cognitive, psychology, and, perception, in, psychology, research, in, speech, perception, seeks, to, understand, how, listeners, recognize, speech, sounds, and, use, this, information, to, understand, spoken, language, research, into, speech, perception, also, has, applications, in, building, computer, systems, that, can, recognize, speech, as, well, as, improving, speech, recognition, for, hearing, and, language, impaired, listeners, speech, perception, is, categorical, in, that, people, put, the, sounds, they, hear, into, categories, rather, than, perceiving, them, as, a, spectrum, people, are, more, likely, to, be, able, to, hear, differences, in, sounds, across, categorical, boundaries, than, within, them, a, good, example, of, this, is, voice, onset, time, vot, one, aspect, of, the, phonetic, production, of, consonant, sounds, for, example, hebrew, speakers, who, distinguish, voiced, b, from, voiceless, p, will, more, easily, detect, a, change, in, vot, from, 10, perceived, as, b, to, 0, perceived, as, p, than, a, change, in, vot, from, 10, to, 20, or, 10, to, 20, despite, this, being, an, equally, large, change, on, the, vot, spectrum, most, human, children, develop, proto, speech, babbling, behaviors, when, they, are, four, to, six, months, old, most, will, begin, saying, their, first, words, at, some, point, during, the, first, year, of, life, typical, children, progress, through, two, or, three, word, phrases, before, three, years, of, age, followed, by, short, sentences, by, four, years, of, age, in, speech, repetition, speech, being, heard, is, quickly, turned, from, sensory, input, into, motor, instructions, needed, for, its, immediate, or, delayed, vocal, imitation, in, phonological, memory, this, type, of, mapping, plays, a, key, role, in, enabling, children, to, expand, their, spoken, vocabulary, masur, 1995, found, that, how, often, children, repeat, novel, words, versus, those, they, already, have, in, their, lexicon, is, related, to, the, size, of, their, lexicon, later, on, with, young, children, who, repeat, more, novel, words, having, a, larger, lexicon, later, in, development, speech, repetition, could, help, facilitate, the, acquisition, of, this, larger, lexicon, there, are, several, organic, and, psychological, factors, that, can, affect, speech, among, these, are, speech, and, language, disorders, can, also, result, from, stroke, brain, injury, hearing, loss, developmental, delay, a, cleft, palate, cerebral, palsy, or, emotional, issues, speech, related, diseases, disorders, and, conditions, can, be, treated, by, a, speech, language, pathologist, slp, or, speech, therapist, slps, assess, levels, of, speech, needs, make, diagnoses, based, on, the, assessments, and, then, treat, the, diagnoses, or, address, the, needs, the, classical, or, wernicke, geschwind, model, of, the, language, system, in, the, brain, focuses, on, broca, s, area, in, the, inferior, prefrontal, cortex, and, wernicke, s, area, in, the, posterior, superior, temporal, gyrus, on, the, dominant, hemisphere, of, the, brain, typically, the, left, hemisphere, for, language, in, this, model, a, linguistic, auditory, signal, is, first, sent, from, the, auditory, cortex, to, wernicke, s, area, the, lexicon, is, accessed, in, wernicke, s, area, and, these, words, are, sent, via, the, arcuate, fasciculus, to, broca, s, area, where, morphology, syntax, and, instructions, for, articulation, are, generated, this, is, then, sent, from, broca, s, area, to, the, motor, cortex, for, articulation, paul, broca, identified, an, approximate, region, of, the, brain, in, 1861, which, when, damaged, in, two, of, his, patients, caused, severe, deficits, in, speech, production, where, his, patients, were, unable, to, speak, beyond, a, few, monosyllabic, words, this, deficit, known, as, broca, s, or, expressive, aphasia, is, characterized, by, difficulty, in, speech, production, where, speech, is, slow, and, labored, function, words, are, absent, and, syntax, is, severely, impaired, as, in, telegraphic, speech, in, expressive, aphasia, speech, comprehension, is, generally, less, affected, except, in, the, comprehension, of, grammatically, complex, sentences, wernicke, s, area, is, named, after, carl, wernicke, who, in, 1874, proposed, a, connection, between, damage, to, the, posterior, area, of, the, left, superior, temporal, gyrus, and, aphasia, as, he, noted, that, not, all, aphasic, patients, had, had, damage, to, the, prefrontal, cortex, damage, to, wernicke, s, area, produces, wernicke, s, or, receptive, aphasia, which, is, characterized, by, relatively, normal, syntax, and, prosody, but, severe, impairment, in, lexical, access, resulting, in, poor, comprehension, and, nonsensical, or, jargon, speech, modern, models, of, the, neurological, systems, behind, linguistic, comprehension, and, production, recognize, the, importance, of, broca, s, and, wernicke, s, areas, but, are, not, limited, to, them, nor, solely, to, the, left, hemisphere, instead, multiple, streams, are, involved, in, speech, production, and, comprehension, damage, to, the, left, lateral, sulcus, has, been, connected, with, difficulty, in, processing, and, producing, morphology, and, syntax, while, lexical, access, and, comprehension, of, irregular, forms, e, g, eat, ate, remain, unaffected, moreover, the, circuits, involved, in, human, speech, comprehension, dynamically, adapt, with, learning, for, example, by, becoming, more, efficient, in, terms, of, processing, time, when, listening, to, familiar, messages, such, as, learned, verses, some, non, human, animals, can, produce, sounds, or, gestures, resembling, those, of, a, human, language, several, species, or, groups, of, animals, have, developed, forms, of, communication, which, superficially, resemble, verbal, language, however, these, usually, are, not, considered, a, language, because, they, lack, one, or, more, of, the, defining, characteristics, e, g, grammar, syntax, recursion, and, displacement, researchers, have, been, successful, in, teaching, some, animals, to, make, gestures, similar, to, sign, language, although, whether, this, should, be, considered, a, language, has, been, disputed
