imagination, is, the, production, of, sensations, feelings, and, thoughts, informing, oneself, these, experiences, can, be, re, creations, of, past, experiences, such, as, vivid, memories, with, imagined, changes, or, completely, invented, and, possibly, fantastic, scenes, imagination, helps, apply, knowledge, to, solve, problems, and, is, fundamental, to, integrating, experience, and, the, learning, process, imagination, is, the, process, of, developing, theories, and, ideas, based, on, the, functioning, of, the, mind, through, a, creative, division, drawing, from, actual, perceptions, imagination, employs, intricate, conditional, processes, that, engage, both, semantic, and, episodic, memory, to, generate, new, or, refined, ideas, this, part, of, the, mind, helps, develop, better, and, easier, ways, to, accomplish, tasks, whether, old, or, new, a, way, to, train, imagination, is, by, listening, to, and, practicing, storytelling, narrative, wherein, imagination, is, expressed, through, stories, and, writings, such, as, fairy, tales, fantasies, and, science, fiction, when, children, develop, their, imagination, they, often, exercise, it, through, pretend, play, they, use, role, playing, to, act, out, what, they, have, imagined, and, followingly, they, play, on, by, acting, as, if, their, make, believe, scenarios, are, actual, reality, the, english, word, imagination, originates, from, the, latin, term, imaginatio, which, is, the, standard, latin, translation, of, the, greek, term, phantasia, the, latin, term, also, translates, to, mental, image, or, fancy, the, use, of, the, word, imagination, in, english, can, be, traced, back, to, the, mid, 14th, century, referring, to, a, faculty, of, the, mind, that, forms, and, manipulates, images, in, modern, philosophical, understanding, imagination, is, commonly, seen, as, a, faculty, for, creating, mental, images, and, for, making, non, rational, associative, transitions, among, these, images, one, view, of, imagination, links, it, to, cognition, suggesting, that, imagination, is, a, cognitive, process, in, mental, functioning, it, is, also, associated, with, rational, thinking, in, a, way, that, both, imaginative, and, rational, thoughts, involve, the, cognitive, process, that, underpins, thinking, about, possibilities, however, imagination, is, not, considered, to, be, purely, a, cognitive, activity, because, it, is, also, linked, to, the, body, and, place, it, involves, setting, up, relationships, with, materials, and, people, precluding, the, notion, that, imagination, is, confined, to, the, mind, the, psychological, view, of, imagination, relates, this, concept, to, a, cognate, term, mental, imagery, which, denotes, the, process, of, reviving, in, the, mind, recollections, of, objects, previously, given, in, sense, perception, since, this, use, of, the, term, conflicts, with, that, of, ordinary, language, some, psychologists, prefer, to, describe, this, process, as, imaging, or, imagery, or, to, speak, of, it, as, reproductive, as, opposed, to, productive, or, constructive, imagination, constructive, imagination, is, further, divided, into, voluntary, imagination, driven, by, the, lateral, prefrontal, cortex, lpfc, such, as, mental, rotation, and, involuntary, imagination, lpfc, independent, such, as, rem, sleep, dreaming, daydreaming, hallucinations, and, spontaneous, insight, in, clinical, settings, clinicians, nowadays, increasingly, make, use, of, visual, imagery, for, psychological, treatment, of, anxiety, disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and, parkinson, s, disease, ancient, greek, philosophers, conceived, imagination, or, phantasia, as, working, with, pictures, in, the, sense, of, mental, images, aristotle, in, his, work, de, anima, identified, imagination, as, a, faculty, that, enables, an, image, to, occur, within, us, a, definition, associating, imagination, with, a, broad, range, of, activities, involved, in, thoughts, dreams, and, memories, in, philebus, plato, discusses, daydreaming, and, considers, imagination, about, the, future, as, the, work, of, a, painter, within, the, soul, however, plato, portrayed, this, painter, as, an, illustrator, rather, than, a, creator, reflecting, his, view, of, imagination, as, a, representational, rather, than, an, inventive, faculty, greek, philosophers, typically, distinguished, imagination, from, perception, and, rational, thinking, for, imagination, is, different, from, either, perceiving, or, discursive, thinking, though, it, is, not, found, without, sensation, or, judgement, without, it, de, anima, iii, 3, aristotle, viewed, imagination, as, a, faculty, that, mediates, between, the, senses, and, intellect, the, mental, images, it, manipulates, whether, arising, from, visions, dreams, or, sensory, perception, were, thought, to, be, transmitted, through, the, lower, parts, of, the, soul, suggesting, that, these, images, could, be, influenced, by, emotions, and, primal, desires, thereby, confusing, the, judgement, of, the, intellect, in, the, middle, ages, the, concept, of, imagination, encompassed, domains, such, as, religion, literature, artwork, and, notably, poetry, men, of, science, often, recognized, poets, as, imaginative, viewing, imagination, as, the, mental, faculty, that, specifically, permitted, poetry, writing, this, association, they, suggested, lies, in, the, capacity, of, imagination, for, image, making, and, image, forming, which, results, in, a, sense, of, visualizing, with, the, inner, eye, an, epitome, of, this, concept, is, chaucer, s, idea, of, the, mind, s, eye, in, the, man, of, law, s, tale, from, the, canterbury, tales, ca, 1390, he, described, a, man, who, although, blind, was, able, to, see, with, an, eye, of, his, mind, that, oon, of, hem, was, blynd, and, myghte, not, see, but, it, were, with, thilke, eyen, of, his, mynde, with, whiche, men, seen, after, that, they, ben, blynde, medieval, theories, of, faculty, psychology, posited, imagination, as, a, faculty, of, the, internal, senses, alongside, memory, and, common, sense, imagination, receives, mental, images, from, memory, or, perception, organizes, them, and, transmits, them, to, the, reasoning, faculties, providing, the, intellect, with, sense, data, in, this, way, it, enables, the, reshaping, of, images, from, sense, perception, even, in, the, absence, of, perception, such, as, in, dreams, performing, a, filtering, function, of, reality, although, not, attributed, the, capacity, for, creations, imagination, was, thought, to, combine, images, received, from, memory, or, perception, in, creative, ways, allowing, for, the, invention, of, novel, concepts, or, expressions, for, example, it, could, fuse, images, of, gold, and, mountain, to, produce, the, idea, of, a, golden, mountain, in, medieval, artistic, works, imagination, served, the, role, of, combining, images, of, perceivable, things, to, portray, legendary, mysterious, or, extraordinary, creatures, this, can, be, seen, in, the, depiction, of, a, mongolian, in, the, grandes, chroniques, de, france, 1241, as, well, as, in, the, portrayal, of, angels, demons, hell, and, the, apocalypse, in, christian, religious, paintings, the, renaissance, saw, the, revival, of, classical, texts, and, the, celebration, for, men, s, dignity, yet, scholars, of, the, time, did, not, significantly, contribute, to, the, conceptual, understanding, of, imagination, marsilio, ficino, for, example, did, not, regard, artistic, creations, such, as, painting, sculpture, and, poetry, as, privileged, forms, of, human, creativity, nor, did, he, attribute, creativity, to, the, faculty, of, imagination, instead, ficino, posited, that, imagination, could, be, the, vehicle, through, which, divine, intervention, transmits, insights, in, the, form, of, images, which, ultimately, facilitates, the, creation, of, art, nevertheless, the, groundwork, laid, by, humanists, made, it, easier, for, later, thinkers, to, develop, the, connection, between, imagination, and, creativity, early, modern, philosophers, began, to, consider, imagination, as, a, trait, or, ability, that, an, individual, could, possess, miguel, de, cervantes, influenced, by, spanish, physician, and, philosopher, juan, huarte, de, san, juan, crafted, the, iconic, character, don, quixote, who, epitomized, huarte, s, idea, of, wits, full, of, invention, this, type, of, wit, was, thought, to, be, typically, found, in, individuals, for, whom, imagination, was, the, most, prominent, component, of, their, ingenium, spanish, ingenio, term, meaning, close, to, intellect, early, modern, philosophers, also, started, to, acknowledge, imagination, as, an, active, cognitive, faculty, although, it, was, principally, seen, as, a, mediator, between, sense, perception, latin, sensus, and, pure, understanding, latin, intellectio, pura, ren, descartes, in, meditations, on, first, philosophy, 1641, interpreted, imagination, as, a, faculty, actively, focusing, on, bodies, corporeal, entities, while, being, passively, dependent, on, stimuli, from, different, senses, in, the, writing, of, thomas, hobbes, imagination, became, a, key, element, of, human, cognition, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, connotations, of, imagination, extended, to, many, areas, of, early, modern, civic, life, juan, luis, vives, noted, the, connection, between, imagination, and, rhetoric, skills, huarte, extended, this, idea, linking, imagination, to, any, disciplines, that, necessitates, figures, correspondence, harmony, and, proportion, such, as, medical, practice, and, the, art, of, warfare, additionally, galileo, used, the, concept, of, imagination, to, conduct, thought, experiments, such, as, asking, readers, to, imagine, the, direction, a, stone, released, from, a, sling, would, fly, by, the, age, of, enlightenment, philosophical, discussions, frequently, linked, the, power, of, imagination, with, creativity, particularly, in, aesthetics, william, duff, was, among, the, first, to, identify, imagination, as, a, quality, of, genius, distinguishing, it, from, talent, by, emphasizing, that, only, genius, is, characterized, by, creative, innovation, samuel, taylor, coleridge, distinguished, between, imagination, expressing, realities, of, an, imaginal, realm, above, our, mundane, personal, existence, and, fancy, or, fantasy, which, represents, the, creativity, of, the, artistic, soul, in, preliminary, discourse, to, the, encyclopedia, of, diderot, french, discours, pr, liminaire, des, diteurs, d, alembert, referred, to, imagination, as, the, creative, force, for, fine, arts, immanuel, kant, in, his, critique, of, pure, reason, german, kritik, der, reinen, vernunft, viewed, imagination, german, einbildungskraft, as, a, faculty, of, intuition, capable, of, making, presentations, i, e, sensible, representations, of, objects, that, are, not, directly, present, kant, distinguished, two, forms, of, imagination, productive, and, reproductive, productive, imagination, functions, as, the, original, source, of, the, presentation, of, an, object, thus, preceding, experience, while, reproductive, imagination, generates, presentations, derived, from, past, experiences, recalling, empirical, intuitions, it, previously, had, kant, s, treatise, linked, imagination, to, cognition, perception, aesthetic, judgement, artistic, creation, and, morality, the, kantian, idea, prepared, the, way, for, fichte, schelling, and, the, romantics, to, transform, the, philosophical, understanding, of, it, into, an, authentic, creative, force, associated, with, genius, inventive, activity, and, freedom, in, the, work, of, hegel, imagination, though, not, given, as, much, importance, as, by, his, predecessors, served, as, a, starting, point, for, the, defense, of, hegelian, phenomenology, hegel, distinguished, between, a, phenomenological, account, of, imagination, which, focuses, on, the, lived, experience, and, consciousness, and, a, scientific, speculative, account, which, seeks, to, understand, the, nature, and, function, of, imagination, in, a, systematic, and, theoretical, manner, between, 1913, and, 1916, carl, jung, developed, the, concept, of, active, imagination, and, introduced, it, into, psychotherapy, for, jung, active, imagination, often, includes, working, with, dreams, and, the, creative, self, via, imagination, or, fantasy, it, is, a, meditation, technique, wherein, the, contents, of, one, s, unconscious, are, translated, into, images, narratives, or, personified, as, separate, entities, thus, serving, as, a, bridge, between, the, conscious, ego, and, the, unconscious, albert, einstein, famously, said, imagination, is, more, important, than, knowledge, knowledge, is, limited, imagination, encircles, the, world, nikola, tesla, described, imagination, as, when, i, get, an, idea, i, start, at, once, building, it, up, in, my, imagination, i, change, the, construction, make, improvements, and, operate, the, device, in, my, mind, it, is, absolutely, immaterial, to, me, whether, i, run, my, turbine, in, thought, or, test, it, in, my, shop, i, even, note, if, it, is, out, of, balance, there, is, no, difference, whatever, the, results, are, the, same, in, this, way, i, am, able, to, rapidly, develop, and, perfect, a, conception, without, touching, anything, the, phenomenology, of, imagination, is, discussed, in, the, imaginary, a, phenomenological, psychology, of, the, imagination, french, l, imaginaire, psychologie, ph, nom, nologique, de, l, imagination, also, published, under, the, title, the, psychology, of, the, imagination, a, 1940, book, by, jean, paul, sartre, in, this, book, sartre, propounded, his, concept, of, imagination, with, imaginary, objects, being, melanges, of, past, impressions, and, recent, knowledge, and, discussed, what, the, existence, of, imagination, shows, about, the, nature, of, human, consciousness, based, on, sartre, s, work, subsequent, thinkers, extended, this, idea, into, the, realm, of, sociology, proposing, ideas, such, as, imaginary, and, the, ontology, of, imagination, imagination, has, been, and, continues, to, be, a, well, acknowledged, concept, in, many, cultures, particularly, within, religious, contexts, as, an, image, forming, faculty, of, the, mind, in, buddhist, aesthetics, imagination, plays, a, crucial, role, in, religious, practice, especially, in, visualization, practices, which, include, the, recollection, of, the, buddha, s, body, visualization, of, celestial, buddhas, and, buddha, fields, pure, lands, and, mandalas, and, devotion, to, images, in, zhuang, zi, s, taoism, imagination, is, perceived, as, a, complex, mental, activity, that, is, championed, as, a, vital, form, of, cognition, it, is, defended, on, empathetic, grounds, but, discredited, by, the, rational, intellect, as, only, a, presentation, and, fantasy, memory, and, mental, imagery, are, two, mental, activities, involved, in, the, process, of, imagination, each, influencing, the, other, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, technology, shows, that, remembering, and, imagining, activate, the, identical, parts, of, the, brain, when, compared, to, the, recall, of, common, ideas, the, generation, of, new, and, old, original, ideas, exhibits, a, similar, activation, pattern, particularly, in, the, bilateral, parahippocampal, and, medial, prefrontal, cortex, mpfc, regions, this, suggests, that, the, construction, of, new, ideas, relies, on, processes, similar, to, those, in, the, reconstruction, of, original, ideas, from, episodic, memory, piaget, posited, that, a, person, s, perceptions, depend, on, their, world, view, the, world, view, is, the, result, of, arranging, perceptions, into, existing, imagery, by, imagination, piaget, cites, the, example, of, a, child, saying, that, the, moon, is, following, her, when, she, walks, around, the, village, at, night, like, this, perceptions, are, integrated, into, the, world, view, so, that, they, make, sense, imagination, is, needed, to, make, sense, of, perceptions, the, neocortex, and, thalamus, are, crucial, in, controlling, the, brain, s, imagination, as, well, as, other, functions, such, as, consciousness, and, abstract, thought, imagination, involves, many, different, brain, functions, including, emotions, memory, and, thoughts, visual, imagery, involves, a, network, of, brain, areas, from, the, frontal, cortex, to, sensory, areas, overlapping, with, the, default, mode, network, and, can, function, much, like, a, weak, version, of, afferent, perception, a, study, that, used, fmri, while, subjects, were, asked, to, imagine, precise, visual, figures, to, mentally, disassemble, them, or, mentally, blend, them, showed, activity, in, the, occipital, frontoparietal, posterior, parietal, precuneus, and, dorsolateral, prefrontal, regions, of, the, subject, s, brains, phylogenetic, acquisition, of, imagination, was, a, gradual, process, the, simplest, form, of, imagination, rem, sleep, dreaming, evolved, in, mammals, with, acquisition, of, rem, sleep, 140, million, years, ago, spontaneous, insight, improved, in, primates, with, acquisition, of, the, lateral, prefrontal, cortex, 70, million, years, ago, after, hominins, split, from, the, chimpanzee, line, 6, million, years, ago, they, further, improved, their, imagination, prefrontal, analysis, was, acquired, 3, 3, million, years, ago, when, hominins, started, to, manufacture, mode, one, stone, tools, progress, in, stone, tools, culture, to, mode, two, stone, tools, by, 2, million, years, ago, signifies, remarkable, improvement, of, prefrontal, analysis, the, most, advanced, mechanism, of, imagination, prefrontal, synthesis, was, likely, acquired, by, humans, around, 70, 000, years, ago, and, resulted, in, behavioral, modernity, this, leap, toward, modern, imagination, has, been, characterized, by, paleoanthropologists, as, the, cognitive, revolution, upper, paleolithic, revolution, and, the, great, leap, forward, moral, imagination, usually, describes, the, mental, capacity, to, find, answers, to, ethical, questions, and, dilemmas, through, the, process, of, imagination, and, visualization, different, definitions, of, moral, imagination, can, be, found, in, the, literature, the, philosopher, mark, johnson, described, it, as, in, one, proposed, example, hitler, s, assassin, claus, von, stauffenberg, was, said, to, have, decided, to, dare, to, overthrow, the, nazi, regime, as, a, result, among, other, factors, of, a, process, of, moral, imagination, his, willingness, to, kill, hitler, was, less, due, to, his, compassion, for, his, comrades, his, family, or, friends, living, at, that, time, but, from, thinking, about, the, potential, problems, of, later, generations, and, people, he, did, not, know, in, other, words, through, a, process, of, moral, imagination, he, developed, empathy, for, abstract, people, for, example, germans, of, later, generations, people, who, were, not, yet, alive, as, a, subcomponent, of, artificial, general, intelligence, artificial, imagination, generates, simulates, and, facilitates, real, or, possible, fiction, models, to, create, predictions, inventions, or, conscious, experiences, the, term, also, refers, to, the, capability, of, machines, or, programs, to, simulate, human, activities, including, creativity, vision, digital, art, humour, and, satire, the, research, fields, of, artificial, imagination, traditionally, include, artificial, visual, and, aural, imagination, which, extend, to, all, actions, involved, in, forming, ideas, images, and, concepts, activities, linked, to, imagination, practitioners, are, also, exploring, topics, such, as, artificial, visual, memory, modeling, and, filtering, content, based, on, human, emotions, and, interactive, search, additionally, there, is, interest, in, how, artificial, imagination, may, evolve, to, create, an, artificial, world, comfortable, enough, for, people, to, use, as, an, escape, from, reality, a, subfield, of, artificial, imagination, that, receives, rising, concern, is, artificial, morals, artificial, intelligence, faces, challenges, regarding, the, responsibility, for, machines, mistakes, or, decisions, and, the, difficulty, in, creating, machines, with, universally, accepted, moral, rules, recent, research, in, artificial, morals, bypasses, the, strict, definition, of, morality, using, machine, learning, methods, to, train, machines, to, imitate, human, morals, instead, however, by, considering, data, about, moral, decisions, from, thousands, of, people, the, trained, moral, model, may, reflect, widely, accepted, rules, three, philosophers, for, whom, imagination, is, a, central, concept, are, kendall, walton, john, sallis, and, richard, kearney, see, in, particular, the, dictionary, definition, of, imagination, at, wiktionary
