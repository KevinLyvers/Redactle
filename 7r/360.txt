the, eskaleut, s, k, l, i, u, t, e, skal, ee, oot, eskimo, aleut, or, inuit, yupik, unangan, languages, are, a, language, family, native, to, the, northern, portions, of, the, north, american, continent, and, a, small, part, of, northeastern, asia, languages, in, the, family, are, indigenous, to, parts, of, what, are, now, the, united, states, alaska, canada, inuit, nunangat, including, nunavut, northwest, territories, principally, in, the, inuvialuit, settlement, region, northern, quebec, nunavik, and, northern, labrador, nunatsiavut, greenland, and, the, russian, far, east, chukchi, peninsula, the, language, family, is, also, known, as, eskaleutian, or, eskaleutic, the, eskaleut, language, family, is, divided, into, two, branches, eskimoan, and, aleut, the, aleut, branch, consists, of, a, single, language, aleut, spoken, in, the, aleutian, islands, and, the, pribilof, islands, aleut, is, divided, into, several, dialects, the, eskimoan, languages, are, divided, into, two, branches, the, yupik, languages, spoken, in, western, and, southwestern, alaska, and, in, chukotka, and, the, inuit, languages, spoken, in, northern, alaska, canada, and, greenland, inuit, languages, which, cover, a, huge, range, of, territory, are, divided, into, several, varieties, neighbouring, varieties, are, quite, similar, although, those, at, the, farthest, distances, from, the, centre, in, the, diomede, islands, and, east, greenland, are, quite, divergent, the, proper, place, of, one, language, sirenik, within, the, eskimoan, family, has, not, been, settled, while, some, linguists, list, it, as, a, branch, of, yupik, others, list, it, as, a, separate, branch, of, the, eskimoan, family, alongside, the, yupik, and, inuit, languages, the, alaska, native, language, center, believes, that, the, common, ancestral, language, of, the, eskimoan, languages, and, of, aleut, divided, into, the, eskimoan, and, aleut, branches, at, least, 4, 000, years, ago, the, eskimoan, language, family, split, into, the, yupik, and, inuit, branches, around, 1, 000, years, ago, more, recent, classifications, find, a, third, branch, old, sirenik, the, eskaleut, languages, are, among, the, native, languages, of, the, americas, this, is, a, geographical, category, not, a, genealogical, one, the, eskaleut, languages, are, not, demonstrably, related, to, the, other, language, families, of, north, america, and, are, believed, to, represent, a, separate, and, the, last, prehistoric, migration, of, people, from, asia, alexander, vovin, 2015, notes, that, northern, tungusic, languages, which, are, spoken, in, eastern, siberia, and, northeastern, china, have, eskaleut, loanwords, that, are, not, found, in, southern, tungusic, implying, that, eskaleut, was, once, much, more, widely, spoken, in, eastern, siberia, vovin, 2015, estimates, that, the, eskaleut, loanwords, in, northern, tungusic, had, been, borrowed, no, more, than, 2, 000, years, ago, which, was, when, tungusic, was, spreading, northwards, from, its, homeland, in, the, middle, reaches, of, the, amur, river, vovin, 2015, concludes, that, the, homeland, urheimat, of, proto, eskaleut, was, in, siberia, rather, than, in, alaska, aleut, sirenik, alutiiq, central, alaskan, yup, ik, naukan, central, siberian, yupik, i, upiaq, inuvialuktun, inuktitut, greenlandic, eskaleut, does, not, have, any, genetic, relationship, to, any, of, the, world, s, other, language, families, this, being, generally, accepted, by, linguists, at, the, present, time, there, is, general, agreement, that, it, is, not, closely, related, to, the, other, language, families, of, north, america, the, more, credible, proposals, on, the, external, relations, of, eskaleut, all, concern, one, or, more, of, the, language, families, of, northern, eurasia, such, as, chukotko, kamchatkan, just, across, the, bering, strait, one, of, the, first, such, proposals, the, eskimo, uralic, hypothesis, was, suggested, by, the, pioneering, danish, linguist, rasmus, rask, in, 1818, upon, noticing, similarities, between, greenlandic, and, finnish, perhaps, the, most, fully, developed, proposal, to, date, is, michael, fortescue, s, uralo, siberian, hypothesis, published, in, 1998, which, links, eskaleut, languages, to, yukaghir, and, the, uralic, languages, more, recently, joseph, greenberg, 2000, 2002, suggested, grouping, eskaleut, with, all, of, the, language, families, of, northern, eurasia, indo, european, uralic, altaic, korean, japanese, ainu, nivkh, gilayak, and, chukchi, kamchatkan, with, the, exception, of, yeniseian, in, a, proposed, language, family, called, eurasiatic, such, proposals, are, not, generally, accepted, criticisms, have, been, made, stating, that, greenberg, s, hypothesis, is, ahistorical, meaning, that, it, lacks, and, sacrifices, known, historical, elements, of, language, in, favour, of, external, similarities, although, the, eurasiatic, hypothesis, is, generally, disregarded, by, linguists, one, critique, by, stefan, georg, and, alexander, vovin, stated, that, they, were, not, willing, to, disregard, the, theory, immediately, although, ultimately, agreed, that, greenberg, s, conclusion, was, dubious, greenberg, explicitly, states, that, his, developments, were, based, on, the, previous, macro, comparative, work, done, by, vladislav, illich, svitych, and, bomhard, and, kerns, by, providing, evidence, of, lexical, comparison, greenberg, hoped, that, it, would, strengthen, his, hypothesis, despite, all, these, efforts, the, eurasiatic, language, theory, was, overruled, on, the, basis, that, mass, comparison, is, not, accurate, enough, an, approach, in, comparative, linguistics, the, comparative, method, bases, its, validity, on, highly, regular, changes, not, occasional, semantic, and, phonological, similarities, which, is, what, the, eurasiatic, hypothesis, provides, in, the, 1960s, morris, swadesh, suggested, a, connection, with, the, wakashan, languages, this, was, expanded, by, jan, henrik, holst, 2005, every, word, must, have, only, one, root, free, morpheme, always, at, the, beginning, eskaleut, languages, have, a, relatively, small, number, of, roots, in, the, case, of, central, alaskan, yup, ik, around, two, thousand, following, the, root, are, a, number, of, postbases, which, are, bound, morphemes, that, add, to, the, basic, meaning, of, the, root, if, the, meaning, of, the, postbase, is, to, be, expressed, alone, a, special, neutral, root, in, the, case, of, central, alaskan, yup, ik, and, inuktitut, pi, is, used, the, basic, word, schema, is, as, follows, root, affixes, inflection, enclitic, below, is, an, example, from, central, siberian, yupik, angyagh, gh, lla, ng, e, yug, tuq, lu, boat, big, acquire, want, to, ind, 3s, also, angyagh, gh, lla, ng, e, yug, tuq, lu, boat, big, acquire, want, to, ind, 3s, also, also, he, wants, to, acquire, a, big, boat, there, are, a, total, of, three, affixes, internal, to, the, word, angyagh, the, root, or, free, morpheme, angyagh, and, the, inflection, tuq, on, the, right, consist, of, the, indicative, mood, marker, plus, third, person, singular, the, enclitic, lu, also, follows, the, inflection, following, the, postbases, are, non, lexical, suffixes, that, indicate, case, on, nouns, and, person, and, mood, on, verbs, the, number, of, cases, varies, with, aleut, languages, having, a, greatly, reduced, case, system, compared, to, eskimoan, the, eskimoan, languages, are, ergative, absolutive, in, nouns, and, in, yup, ik, languages, also, in, verbal, person, marking, all, eskaleut, languages, have, obligatory, verbal, agreement, with, agent, and, patient, in, transitive, clauses, and, there, are, special, suffixes, used, for, this, purpose, in, subordinate, clauses, which, makes, these, languages, like, most, in, the, north, pacific, highly, complement, deranking, at, the, end, of, a, word, there, can, be, one, of, a, small, number, of, clitics, with, meanings, such, as, but, or, indicating, a, polar, question, phonologically, the, eskaleut, languages, resemble, other, language, families, of, northern, north, america, na, dene, and, tsimshianic, and, far, eastern, siberia, chukotko, kamchatkan, there, are, usually, only, three, vowels, a, i, u, though, some, yup, ik, dialects, also, have, all, eskaleut, languages, lack, both, ejectives, and, aspirates, in, which, they, resemble, the, siberian, languages, more, than, the, north, american, ones, eskaleut, languages, possess, voiceless, plosives, at, four, positions, bilabial, coronal, velar, and, uvular, in, all, languages, except, aleut, which, has, lost, the, bilabial, stops, though, it, has, retained, the, nasal, there, are, usually, contrasting, voiced, and, voiceless, fricatives, at, the, same, positions, and, in, the, eskimoan, subfamily, a, voiceless, alveolar, lateral, fricative, is, also, present, a, rare, feature, of, many, dialects, of, yup, ik, and, aleut, is, contrasting, voiceless, nasals, the, following, vowels, and, consonants, were, taken, from, michael, fortescue, et, al, 2010, eskimoan, corresponds, to, aleut, i, inuit, allows, only, a, single, initial, consonant, and, no, more, than, two, successive, consonants, between, vowels, yupik, lacks, the, consonant, assimilation, process, so, common, to, inuit, consonants, in, parentheses, are, non, proto, eskimoan, phonemes, the, following, vowels, and, consonants, were, taken, from, knut, bergsland, 1997, the, aleut, language, has, six, vowels, in, total, three, short, vowels, i, u, a, and, three, long, vowels, i, u, a, orthographically, they, would, be, spelled, ii, uu, and, aa, there, are, no, diphthongs, in, aleut, vowels, the, length, of, the, vowel, is, dependent, upon, three, characteristics, stress, surrounding, consonants, and, in, particularly, eastern, aleut, surrounding, vowels, short, vowels, are, in, initial, position, if, a, following, consonant, is, velar, or, labial, for, example, the, demonstratives, uka, ika, and, aka, long, vowels, are, lower, than, their, short, counterpart, vowels, but, are, less, retracted, if, they, make, contact, with, a, uvular, consonant, for, example, uuquchiing, blue, fox, qiiqix, storm, petrel, and, qaaqaan, eat, it, the, aleut, consonants, featured, below, include, single, roman, letters, digraphs, and, one, trigraph, phonemes, in, parentheses, are, found, only, in, russian, and, english, loanwords, the, phoneme, in, italics, is, found, only, in, eastern, aleut, and, the, bold, phonemes, are, a, part, of, the, standard, aleut, inventory, aleut, lacks, labial, stops, and, allows, clusters, of, up, to, three, consonants, as, well, as, consonant, clusters, in, word, initial, position, noteworthy, phonological, features, voiceless, nasals, and, lack, of, a, p, eskaleut, is, polysynthetic, which, features, a, process, in, which, a, single, word, is, able, to, contain, multiple, post, bases, or, morphemes, the, eskaleut, languages, are, exclusively, suffixing, with, the, exception, of, one, prefix, in, inuktitut, that, appears, in, demonstratives, suffixes, are, able, to, combine, and, ultimately, create, an, unlimited, number, of, words, some, of, the, morphemes, that, are, able, to, attach, contain, features, such, as, carrying, nominal, subjects, and, objects, adverbial, information, direct, objects, and, spatial, noun, phrases, polysynthetic, languages, are, said, to, be, a, form, of, extreme, agglutination, which, allows, single, words, to, carry, the, same, information, that, another, language, expresses, in, whole, clauses, for, example, in, central, alaskan, yupik, one, can, say, qayar, kayak, pa, big, li, make, qa, pol, ev, sqe, a, ask, ssaage, but, llru, past, aqa, 1sg, 3sg, ind, qayar, pa, li, qa, sqe, ssaage, llru, aqa, kayak, big, make, pol, ev, a, ask, but, past, 1sg, 3sg, ind, i, asked, him, to, make, a, big, kayak, but, actually, he, has, not, made, it, yet, as, a, polysynthetic, language, eskaleut, is, concerned, with, what, each, morpheme, means, which, categories, it, can, attach, to, whether, there, is, any, category, change, etc, and, what, type, of, morphophonological, effect, occurs, to, the, left, as, it, attaches, to, the, stem, ergative, absolutive, language, eskaleut, follows, the, basic, word, order, of, subject, object, verb, sov, eskimoan, is, an, ergative, absolutive, language, this, means, subjects, of, intransitive, verbs, and, objects, of, transitive, verbs, are, marked, with, the, absolutive, case, while, subjects, of, transitive, verbs, are, marked, with, the, ergative, case, aleut, is, not, an, ergative, absolutive, language, it, does, not, matter, if, the, verb, is, transitive, or, intransitive, subjects, and, objects, are, not, marked, differently, if, a, transitive, object, or, an, object, of, possession, is, openly, communicated, ergative, case, marking, will, not, be, expressed, if, a, transitive, object, or, object, of, possession, is, not, openly, communicated, then, ergative, case, marking, will, be, expressed, example, of, case, marking, in, aleut, taya, u, x, man, abs, qa, x, fish, qa, ku, x, eat, ind, 3sg, taya, u, x, qa, x, qa, ku, x, man, abs, fish, eat, ind, 3sg, the, man, eats, the, a, fish, taya, u, m, man, erg, qa, kuu, eat, 3sg, 3sg, ind, taya, u, m, qa, kuu, man, erg, eat, 3sg, 3sg, ind, the, man, eats, it, the, syntax, of, eskaleut, is, concerned, with, the, functional, use, of, its, morphological, structure, the, two, language, branches, although, part, of, the, same, family, have, separated, and, detached, themselves, in, relation, to, grammatical, similarities, bergsland, states, that, aleut, which, was, once, a, language, more, similar, to, proto, eskimoan, than, the, current, eskimoan, languages, themselves, has, distanced, itself, from, the, ancient, language, the, case, inflections, relative, m, instrumental, mek, men, and, locative, mi, have, undergone, phonological, merger, and, led, to, a, completely, different, explanation, of, ergative, morphology, in, proto, eskimoan, in, order, to, further, explain, the, profound, changes, that, have, occurred, in, aleutian, syntax, bergsland, proposed, the, domino, effect, which, is, ultimately, the, chronological, order, of, aleut, s, unique, features, below, is, a, step, by, step, list, of, the, domino, effect, the, domino, effect, the, following, is, a, comparison, of, cognates, among, the, basic, vocabulary, across, the, eskaleut, language, family, about, 122, words, note, that, empty, cells, do, not, imply, that, a, particular, language, is, lacking, a, word, to, describe, the, concept, but, rather, that, the, word, for, the, concept, in, that, language, is, formed, from, another, stem, and, is, not, a, cognate, with, the, other, words, in, the, row, also, there, may, be, shifts, in, the, meaning, from, one, language, to, another, and, so, the, common, meaning, given, is, only, approximate, in, some, cases, the, form, given, is, found, only, in, some, dialects, of, the, language, forms, are, given, in, native, latin, orthographies, unless, otherwise, noted, cognates, of, the, eskimoan, languages, can, be, found, in, michael, fortescue, et, al, 2010, cognates, of, the, aleut, language, can, be, found, in, knut, bergsland, 1997, there, are, two, types, of, pronouns, independent, pronouns, and, pronominal, pronouns, in, eskaleut, languages, singular, dual, and, plural, nouns, are, marked, by, inflectional, suffixes, and, if, they, are, possessed, the, number, marker, is, followed, by, pronominal, suffixes, that, specify, the, human, possessor, there, are, no, genders, and, this, can, be, seen, in, the, four, persons, my, your, his, her, his, her, own, his, her, own, specifies, ownership, in, contrast, with, his, her, which, does, not, e, g, his, house, vs, his, own, house, see, possessive, determiner, semantics, aleut, uses, independent, pronouns, instead, of, pronominal, marking, on, verbs, on, the, other, hand, eskimoan, languages, have, four, persons, and, three, numbers, marked, by, pronominal, suffixes
