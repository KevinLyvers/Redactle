negligence, lat, negligentia, is, a, failure, to, exercise, appropriate, care, expected, to, be, exercised, in, similar, circumstances, within, the, scope, of, tort, law, negligence, pertains, to, harm, caused, by, the, violation, of, a, duty, of, care, through, a, negligent, act, the, concept, of, negligence, is, linked, to, the, obligation, of, individuals, to, exercise, reasonable, care, in, their, actions, and, to, consider, foreseeable, harm, that, their, conduct, might, cause, to, other, people, or, property, the, elements, of, a, negligence, claim, include, the, duty, to, act, or, refrain, from, action, breach, of, that, duty, actual, and, proximate, cause, of, harm, and, damages, someone, who, suffers, loss, caused, by, another, s, negligence, may, be, able, to, sue, for, damages, to, compensate, for, their, harm, such, loss, may, include, physical, injury, harm, to, property, psychiatric, illness, or, economic, loss, to, successfully, pursue, a, claim, of, negligence, through, a, lawsuit, a, plaintiff, must, establish, the, elements, of, negligence, in, most, jurisdictions, there, are, four, elements, to, a, negligence, action, some, jurisdictions, narrow, the, definition, down, to, three, elements, duty, breach, and, proximately, caused, harm, some, jurisdictions, recognize, five, elements, duty, breach, actual, cause, proximate, cause, and, damages, despite, these, differences, definitions, of, what, constitutes, negligent, conduct, remain, similar, the, legal, liability, of, a, defendant, to, a, plaintiff, is, based, on, the, defendant, s, failure, to, fulfil, a, responsibility, recognised, by, law, of, which, the, plaintiff, is, the, intended, beneficiary, the, first, step, in, determining, the, existence, of, a, legally, recognised, responsibility, is, the, concept, of, an, obligation, or, duty, in, the, tort, of, negligence, the, term, used, is, duty, of, care, the, case, of, donoghue, v, stevenson, established, the, modern, law, of, negligence, laying, the, foundations, of, the, duty, of, care, and, the, fault, principle, which, through, the, privy, council, have, been, adopted, throughout, the, commonwealth, may, donoghue, and, her, friend, were, in, a, caf, in, paisley, the, friend, bought, mrs, donoghue, a, ginger, beer, float, she, drank, some, of, the, beer, and, later, poured, the, remainder, over, her, ice, cream, and, was, horrified, to, see, the, decomposed, remains, of, a, snail, exit, the, bottle, donoghue, suffered, nervous, shock, and, gastro, enteritis, but, did, not, sue, the, cafe, owner, instead, suing, the, manufacturer, stevenson, as, mrs, donoghue, had, not, herself, bought, the, ginger, beer, the, doctrine, of, privity, precluded, a, contractual, action, against, stevenson, the, scottish, judge, lord, macmillan, considered, the, case, to, fall, within, a, new, category, of, delict, the, scots, law, nearest, equivalent, of, tort, the, case, proceeded, to, the, house, of, lords, where, lord, atkin, interpreted, the, biblical, ordinance, to, love, thy, neighbour, as, a, legal, requirement, to, not, harm, thy, neighbour, he, then, went, on, to, define, neighbour, as, persons, who, are, so, closely, and, directly, affected, by, my, act, that, i, ought, reasonably, to, have, them, in, contemplation, as, being, so, affected, when, i, am, directing, my, mind, to, the, acts, or, omissions, that, are, called, in, question, in, england, the, more, recent, case, of, caparo, industries, plc, v, dickman, introduced, a, threefold, test, for, a, duty, of, care, harm, must, be, 1, reasonably, foreseeable, 2, there, must, be, a, relationship, of, proximity, between, the, plaintiff, and, defendant, and, 3, it, must, be, fair, just, and, reasonable, to, impose, liability, however, these, act, as, guidelines, for, the, courts, in, establishing, a, duty, of, care, much, of, the, principle, is, still, at, the, discretion, of, judges, in, australia, donoghue, v, stevenson, was, used, as, a, persuasive, precedent, in, the, case, of, grant, v, australian, knitting, mills, akr, 1936, this, was, a, landmark, case, in, the, development, of, negligence, law, in, australia, whether, a, duty, of, care, is, owed, for, psychiatric, as, opposed, to, physical, harm, was, discussed, in, the, australian, case, of, tame, v, state, of, new, south, wales, annetts, v, australian, stations, pty, ltd, 2002, determining, a, duty, for, mental, harm, has, now, been, subsumed, into, the, civil, liability, act, 2002, in, new, south, wales, the, application, of, part, 3, of, the, civil, liability, act, 2002, nsw, was, demonstrated, in, wicks, v, sra, nsw, sheehan, v, sra, nsw, once, it, is, established, that, the, defendant, owed, a, duty, to, the, plaintiff, claimant, the, matter, of, whether, or, not, that, duty, was, breached, must, be, settled, the, test, is, both, subjective, and, objective, the, defendant, who, knowingly, subjective, which, is, totally, based, on, observation, and, personal, prejudice, or, view, exposes, the, plaintiff, claimant, to, a, substantial, risk, of, loss, breaches, that, duty, the, defendant, who, fails, to, realize, the, substantial, risk, of, loss, to, the, plaintiff, claimant, which, any, reasonable, person, in, the, same, situation, would, clearly, have, realized, also, breaches, that, duty, however, whether, the, test, is, objective, or, subjective, may, depend, upon, the, particular, case, involved, there, is, a, reduced, threshold, for, the, standard, of, care, owed, by, children, in, the, australian, case, of, mchale, v, watson, mchale, a, 9, year, old, girl, was, blinded, in, one, eye, after, being, hit, by, the, ricochet, of, a, sharp, metal, rod, thrown, by, a, 12, year, old, boy, watson, the, defendant, child, was, held, not, to, have, the, level, of, care, to, the, standard, of, an, adult, but, of, a, 12, year, old, child, with, similar, experience, and, intelligence, kitto, j, explained, that, a, child, s, lack, of, foresight, is, a, characteristic, they, share, with, others, at, that, stage, of, development, the, same, principle, was, demonstrated, to, exist, in, english, law, in, mullin, v, richards, certain, jurisdictions, also, provide, for, breaches, where, professionals, such, as, doctors, fail, to, warn, of, risks, associated, with, medical, treatments, or, procedures, doctors, owe, both, objective, and, subjective, duties, to, warn, and, breach, of, either, is, sufficient, to, satisfy, this, element, in, a, court, of, law, for, example, the, civil, liability, act, in, queensland, outlines, a, statutory, test, incorporating, both, objective, and, subjective, elements, for, example, an, obstetrician, who, fails, to, warn, a, mother, of, complications, arising, from, childbirth, may, be, held, to, have, breached, their, professional, duty, of, care, in, donoghue, v, stevenson, lord, macmillan, declared, that, the, categories, of, negligence, are, never, closed, and, in, dorset, yacht, v, home, office, it, was, held, that, the, government, had, no, immunity, from, suit, when, they, negligently, failed, to, prevent, the, escape, of, juvenile, offenders, who, subsequently, vandalise, a, boatyard, in, other, words, all, members, of, society, have, a, duty, to, exercise, reasonable, care, toward, others, and, their, property, in, bolton, v, stone, 1951, the, house, of, lords, held, that, a, defendant, was, not, negligent, if, the, damage, to, the, plaintiff, were, not, a, reasonably, foreseeable, consequence, of, his, conduct, in, the, case, a, miss, stone, was, struck, on, the, head, by, a, cricket, ball, while, standing, outside, a, cricket, ground, finding, that, no, batsman, would, normally, be, able, hit, a, cricket, ball, far, enough, to, reach, a, person, standing, as, far, away, as, was, miss, stone, the, court, held, her, claim, would, fail, because, the, danger, was, not, reasonably, or, sufficiently, foreseeable, as, stated, in, the, opinion, reasonable, risk, cannot, be, judged, with, the, benefit, of, hindsight, in, roe, v, minister, of, health, lord, denning, said, the, past, should, not, be, viewed, through, rose, coloured, spectacles, finding, no, negligence, on, the, part, of, medical, professionals, accused, of, using, contaminated, medical, jars, since, contemporary, standards, would, have, indicated, only, a, low, possibility, of, medical, jar, contamination, for, the, rule, in, the, u, s, see, calculus, of, negligence, further, establishment, of, conditions, of, intention, or, malice, where, applicable, may, apply, in, cases, of, gross, negligence, in, order, for, liability, to, result, from, a, negligent, act, or, omission, it, is, necessary, to, prove, not, only, that, the, injury, was, caused, by, that, negligence, but, also, that, there, is, a, legally, sufficient, connection, between, the, act, and, the, negligence, for, a, defendant, to, be, held, liable, it, must, be, shown, that, the, particular, acts, or, omissions, were, the, cause, of, the, loss, or, damage, sustained, although, the, notion, sounds, simple, the, causation, between, one, s, breach, of, duty, and, the, harm, that, results, to, another, can, at, times, be, very, complicated, the, basic, test, is, to, ask, whether, the, injury, would, have, occurred, but, for, or, without, the, accused, party, s, breach, of, the, duty, owed, to, the, injured, party, in, australia, the, high, court, has, held, that, the, but, for, test, is, not, the, exclusive, test, of, causation, because, it, cannot, address, a, situation, where, there, is, more, than, one, cause, of, damage, when, but, for, test, is, not, satisfied, and, the, case, is, an, exceptional, one, a, commonsense, test, whether, and, why, test, will, be, applied, even, more, precisely, if, a, breaching, party, materially, increases, the, risk, of, harm, to, another, then, the, breaching, party, can, be, sued, to, the, value, of, harm, that, he, caused, asbestos, litigations, which, have, been, ongoing, for, decades, revolve, around, the, issue, of, causation, interwoven, with, the, simple, idea, of, a, party, causing, harm, to, another, are, issues, on, insurance, bills, and, compensations, which, sometimes, drove, compensating, companies, out, of, business, sometimes, factual, causation, is, distinguished, from, legal, causation, to, avert, the, danger, of, defendants, being, exposed, to, in, the, words, of, cardozo, j, liability, in, an, indeterminate, amount, for, an, indeterminate, time, to, an, indeterminate, class, it, is, said, a, new, question, arises, of, how, remote, a, consequence, a, person, s, harm, is, from, another, s, negligence, we, say, that, one, s, negligence, is, too, remote, in, england, or, not, a, proximate, cause, in, the, u, s, of, another, s, harm, if, one, would, never, reasonably, foresee, it, happening, a, proximate, cause, in, u, s, terminology, to, do, with, the, chain, of, events, between, the, action, and, the, injury, should, not, be, confused, with, the, proximity, test, under, the, english, duty, of, care, to, do, with, closeness, of, relationship, the, idea, of, legal, causation, is, that, if, no, one, can, foresee, something, bad, happening, and, therefore, take, care, to, avoid, it, how, could, anyone, be, responsible, for, instance, in, palsgraf, v, long, island, rail, road, co, the, judge, decided, that, the, defendant, a, railway, was, not, liable, for, an, injury, suffered, by, a, distant, bystander, the, plaintiff, palsgraf, was, hit, by, coin, operated, scale, which, toppled, because, of, fireworks, explosion, that, fell, on, her, as, she, waited, on, a, train, platform, the, scales, fell, because, of, a, far, away, commotion, a, train, conductor, had, pushed, a, passenger, holding, a, box, containing, an, explosive, but, it, was, not, clear, that, what, type, of, commotion, caused, the, scale, to, fall, either, it, was, the, explosion, s, effect, or, the, confused, movement, of, the, terrified, people, a, train, conductor, had, run, to, help, a, man, into, a, departing, train, the, man, was, carrying, a, package, as, he, jogged, to, jump, in, the, train, door, the, package, had, fireworks, in, it, the, conductor, mishandled, the, passenger, or, his, package, causing, the, package, to, fall, the, fireworks, slipped, and, exploded, on, the, ground, causing, shockwaves, to, travel, through, the, platform, which, became, the, cause, of, commotion, on, platform, and, as, a, consequence, the, scales, fell, because, palsgraf, was, hurt, by, the, falling, scales, she, sued, the, train, company, who, employed, the, conductor, for, negligence, the, defendant, train, company, argued, it, should, not, be, liable, as, a, matter, of, law, because, despite, the, fact, that, they, employed, the, employee, who, was, negligent, his, negligence, was, too, remote, from, the, plaintiff, s, injury, on, appeal, the, majority, of, the, court, agreed, with, four, judges, adopting, the, reasons, written, by, judge, cardozo, that, the, defendant, owed, no, duty, of, care, to, the, plaintiff, because, a, duty, was, owed, only, to, foreseeable, plaintiffs, three, judges, dissented, arguing, as, written, by, judge, andrews, that, the, defendant, owed, a, duty, to, the, plaintiff, regardless, of, foreseeability, because, all, men, owe, one, another, a, duty, not, to, act, negligently, such, disparity, of, views, on, the, element, of, remoteness, continues, to, trouble, the, judiciary, courts, that, follow, cardozo, s, view, have, greater, control, in, negligence, cases, if, the, court, can, find, that, as, a, matter, of, law, the, defendant, owed, no, duty, of, care, to, the, plaintiff, the, plaintiff, will, lose, his, case, for, negligence, before, having, a, chance, to, present, to, the, jury, cardozo, s, view, is, the, majority, view, however, some, courts, follow, the, position, put, forth, by, judge, andrews, in, jurisdictions, following, the, minority, rule, defendants, must, phrase, their, remoteness, arguments, in, terms, of, proximate, cause, if, they, wish, the, court, to, take, the, case, away, from, the, jury, remoteness, takes, another, form, seen, in, the, wagon, mound, no, 2, the, wagon, mound, was, a, ship, in, sydney, harbour, the, ship, leaked, oil, creating, a, slick, in, part, of, the, harbour, the, wharf, owner, asked, the, ship, owner, about, the, danger, and, was, told, he, could, continue, his, work, because, the, slick, would, not, burn, the, wharf, owner, allowed, work, to, continue, on, the, wharf, which, sent, sparks, onto, a, rag, in, the, water, which, ignited, and, created, a, fire, which, burnt, down, the, wharf, the, privy, council, determined, that, the, wharf, owner, intervened, in, the, causal, chain, creating, a, responsibility, for, the, fire, which, canceled, out, the, liability, of, the, ship, owner, in, australia, the, concept, of, remoteness, or, proximity, was, tested, with, the, case, of, jaensch, v, coffey, the, wife, of, a, policeman, mrs, coffey, suffered, a, nervous, shock, injury, from, the, aftermath, of, a, motor, vehicle, collision, although, she, was, not, actually, at, the, scene, at, the, time, of, the, collision, the, court, upheld, that, in, addition, to, it, being, reasonably, foreseeable, that, his, wife, might, suffer, such, an, injury, it, required, that, there, be, sufficient, proximity, between, the, plaintiff, and, the, defendant, who, caused, the, collision, here, there, was, sufficient, causal, proximity, see, also, kavanagh, v, akhtar, imbree, v, mcneilly, and, tame, v, nsw, even, though, there, is, breach, of, duty, and, the, cause, of, some, injury, to, the, defendant, a, plaintiff, may, not, recover, unless, he, can, prove, that, the, defendant, s, breach, caused, a, pecuniary, injury, as, a, general, rule, plaintiffs, in, tort, litigation, can, only, recover, damages, if, they, prove, both, that, they, suffered, a, loss, and, that, the, loss, was, reasonably, foreseeable, to, the, defendant, when, damages, are, not, a, necessary, element, of, a, tort, claim, a, plaintiff, may, prevail, without, demonstrating, a, financial, injury, potentially, recovering, nominal, damages, along, with, any, other, remedy, available, under, the, law, negligence, is, different, in, that, the, plaintiff, must, ordinarily, prove, a, pecuniary, loss, in, order, to, recover, damages, in, some, cases, such, as, defamation, per, se, damages, may, be, presumed, recovery, for, non, pecuniary, losses, such, as, emotional, injury, are, normally, recoverable, only, if, the, plaintiff, has, also, proved, a, pecuniary, loss, examples, of, pecuniary, loss, include, medical, bills, that, result, from, an, injury, or, repair, costs, or, loss, of, income, due, to, property, damage, the, damage, may, be, physical, purely, economic, both, physical, and, economic, loss, of, earnings, following, a, personal, injury, or, reputational, in, a, defamation, case, in, english, law, the, right, to, claim, for, purely, economic, loss, is, limited, to, a, number, of, special, and, clearly, defined, circumstances, often, related, to, the, nature, of, the, duty, to, the, plaintiff, as, between, clients, and, lawyers, financial, advisers, and, other, professions, where, money, is, central, to, the, consultative, services, emotional, distress, has, been, recognized, as, an, actionable, tort, generally, emotional, distress, damages, had, to, be, parasitic, that, is, the, plaintiff, could, recover, for, emotional, distress, caused, by, injury, but, only, if, it, accompanied, a, physical, or, pecuniary, injury, a, claimant, who, has, suffered, only, emotional, distress, and, no, pecuniary, loss, would, not, recover, for, negligence, however, courts, have, recently, allowed, recovery, for, a, plaintiff, to, recover, for, purely, emotional, distress, under, certain, circumstances, the, state, courts, of, california, allowed, recovery, for, emotional, distress, alone, even, in, the, absence, of, any, physical, injury, when, the, defendant, physically, injures, a, relative, of, the, plaintiff, and, the, plaintiff, witnesses, it, the, eggshell, skull, rule, is, a, legal, doctrine, upheld, in, some, tort, law, systems, which, holds, that, a, tortfeasor, is, liable, for, the, full, extent, of, damage, caused, even, where, the, extent, of, the, damage, is, due, to, the, unforeseen, frailty, of, the, claimant, the, eggshell, skull, rule, was, recently, maintained, in, australia, in, the, case, of, kavanagh, v, akhtar, res, ipsa, loquitur, this, is, latin, for, the, thing, speaks, for, itself, to, prove, negligence, under, this, doctrine, the, plaintiff, must, prove, 1, the, incident, does, not, usually, happen, without, negligence, 2, the, object, that, caused, the, harm, was, under, the, defendant, s, control, and, 3, the, plaintiff, did, not, contribute, to, the, cause, negligence, per, se, comes, down, to, whether, or, not, a, party, violated, a, standard, in, law, meant, to, protect, the, public, such, as, a, building, code, or, speed, limit, damages, place, a, monetary, value, on, the, harm, done, following, the, principle, of, restitutio, in, integrum, latin, for, restoration, to, the, original, condition, thus, for, most, purposes, connected, with, the, quantification, of, damages, the, degree, of, culpability, in, the, breach, of, the, duty, of, care, is, irrelevant, once, the, breach, of, the, duty, is, established, the, only, requirement, is, to, compensate, the, victim, one, of, the, main, tests, that, is, posed, when, deliberating, whether, a, claimant, is, entitled, to, compensation, for, a, tort, is, the, reasonable, person, the, test, is, self, explanatory, would, a, reasonable, person, as, determined, by, a, judge, or, jury, under, the, given, circumstances, have, done, what, the, defendant, did, to, cause, the, injury, in, question, or, in, other, words, would, a, reasonable, person, acting, reasonably, have, engaged, in, similar, conduct, when, compared, to, the, one, whose, actions, caused, the, injury, in, question, simple, as, the, reasonable, person, test, sounds, it, is, very, complicated, it, is, a, risky, test, because, it, involves, the, opinion, of, either, the, judge, or, the, jury, that, can, be, based, on, limited, facts, however, as, vague, as, the, reasonable, person, test, seems, it, is, extremely, important, in, deciding, whether, or, not, a, plaintiff, is, entitled, to, compensation, for, a, negligence, tort, damages, are, compensatory, in, nature, compensatory, damages, addresses, a, plaintiff, claimant, s, losses, in, cases, involving, physical, or, mental, injury, the, amount, awarded, also, compensates, for, pain, and, suffering, the, award, should, make, the, plaintiff, whole, sufficient, to, put, the, plaintiff, back, in, the, position, he, or, she, was, before, defendant, s, negligent, act, anything, more, would, unlawfully, permit, a, plaintiff, to, profit, from, the, tort, there, are, also, two, other, general, principles, relating, to, damages, firstly, the, award, of, damages, should, take, place, in, the, form, of, a, single, lump, sum, payment, therefore, a, defendant, should, not, be, required, to, make, periodic, payments, however, some, statutes, give, exceptions, for, this, secondly, the, court, is, not, concerned, with, how, the, plaintiff, uses, the, award, of, damages, for, example, if, a, plaintiff, is, awarded, 100, 000, for, physical, harm, the, plaintiff, is, not, required, to, spend, this, money, on, medical, bills, to, restore, them, to, their, original, position, they, can, spend, this, money, any, way, they, want, in, the, swiss, criminal, code, the, term, n, gligence, is, used, to, denote, an, omission, akin, to, the, english, term, negligence, however, unlike, criminal, negligence, it, describes, situations, where, the, perpetrator, acts, without, being, aware, of, the, potential, consequences, of, their, actions, or, disregards, these, consequences, similarly, under, the, turkish, penal, code, no, 5237, which, took, effect, on, june, 1, 2005, criminal, negligence, turkish, hmali, su, refers, to, a, person, s, failure, to, act, when, required, by, law, while, negligence, turkish, taksir, is, defined, as, the, occurrence, of, a, legally, foreseen, consequence, due, to, a, lack, of, necessary, care, the, french, penal, code, as, a, rule, requires, a, person, to, have, acted, with, mens, rea, for, an, act, to, be, punishable, comparably, the, italian, penal, code, enacted, on, october, 19, 1930, specifies, in, article, 42, that, a, person, can, only, be, punished, for, a, crime, if, it, was, committed, with, intent, however, article, 43, provides, exceptions, for, crimes, arising, from, negligence, or, exceeding, intentionality, these, negligent, crimes, occur, despite, the, defendant, s, foresight, and, are, the, result, of, negligence, carelessness, lack, of, experience, or, non, compliance, with, laws, regulations, orders, or, disciplinary, rules, consistent, with, other, civil, law, systems, turkish, criminal, law, also, treats, criminal, responsibility, for, acts, committed, negligently, as, an, exception, confined, to, those, acts, explicitly, stated, in, the, law, article, 23, of, the, turkish, penal, code, further, asserts, that, for, crimes, that, are, aggravated, by, their, consequences, to, be, attributed, to, the, perpetrator, the, base, crime, must, be, committed, with, intent, furthermore, concerning, the, aggravated, or, unintended, consequences, the, perpetrator, must, have, acted, with, at, least, a, minimal, level, of, negligence, whether, advertently, or, inadvertently, with, regard, to, negligence, indian, jurisprudence, follows, the, approach, stated, in, ratanlal, dhirajlal, the, law, of, torts, laying, down, three, elements, the, indian, approach, to, professional, negligence, requires, that, any, skilled, task, requires, a, skilled, professional, such, a, professional, would, be, expected, to, be, exercising, his, skill, with, reasonable, competence, professionals, may, be, held, liable, for, negligence, on, one, of, two, findings, the, united, states, generally, recognizes, four, elements, to, a, negligence, action, duty, breach, proximate, causation, and, injury, a, plaintiff, who, makes, a, negligence, claim, must, prove, all, four, elements, of, negligence, in, order, to, win, his, or, her, case, therefore, if, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, the, plaintiff, can, prove, one, of, the, elements, the, defendant, may, request, judicial, resolution, early, on, to, prevent, the, case, from, going, to, a, jury, this, can, be, by, way, of, a, demurrer, motion, to, dismiss, or, motion, for, summary, judgment, the, elements, allow, a, defendant, to, test, a, plaintiff, s, accusations, before, trial, as, well, as, providing, a, guide, to, the, finder, of, fact, at, trial, the, judge, in, a, bench, trial, or, jury, in, a, jury, trial, to, decide, whether, the, defendant, is, or, is, not, liable, whether, the, case, is, resolved, with, or, without, trial, again, depends, heavily, on, the, particular, facts, of, the, case, and, the, ability, of, the, parties, to, frame, the, issues, to, the, court, the, duty, and, causation, elements, in, particular, give, the, court, the, greatest, opportunity, to, take, the, case, from, the, jury, because, they, directly, involve, questions, of, policy, the, court, can, find, that, regardless, of, any, disputed, facts, the, case, may, be, resolved, as, a, matter, of, law, from, undisputed, facts, because, as, a, matter, of, law, the, defendant, cannot, be, legally, responsible, for, the, plaintiff, s, injury, under, a, theory, of, negligence, on, appeal, depending, on, the, disposition, of, the, case, and, the, question, on, appeal, the, court, reviewing, a, trial, court, s, determination, that, the, defendant, was, negligent, will, analyze, at, least, one, of, the, elements, of, the, cause, of, action, to, determine, if, it, is, properly,
