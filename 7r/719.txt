https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgiveness
forgiveness, in, a, psychological, sense, is, the, intentional, and, voluntary, process, by, which, one, who, may, have, felt, initially, wronged, victimized, harmed, or, hurt, goes, through, a, process, in, changing, feelings, and, attitude, regarding, a, given, offender, for, his, her, actions, and, overcomes, the, impact, of, the, offense, flaw, or, mistake, including, negative, emotions, such, as, resentment, or, a, desire, for, vengeance, theorists, differ, in, the, extent, to, which, they, believe, forgiveness, also, implies, replacing, the, negative, emotions, with, positive, attitudes, i, e, an, increased, ability, to, tolerate, the, offender, or, requires, reconciliation, with, the, offender, in, certain, legal, contexts, forgiveness, is, a, term, for, absolving, someone, of, debt, loan, obligation, or, other, claims, such, legal, usage, can, also, be, thought, of, as, mercy, being, distinct, from, forgiveness, on, the, psychological, level, forgiveness, is, different, from, simple, condoning, viewing, an, action, as, harmful, yet, to, be, forgiven, or, overlooked, for, certain, reasons, of, charity, excusing, or, pardoning, merely, releasing, the, offender, from, responsibility, for, an, action, or, forgetting, attempting, to, remove, from, one, s, consciousness, the, memory, of, an, offense, in, some, schools, of, thought, it, involves, a, personal, and, voluntary, effort, at, the, self, transformation, of, one, s, own, half, of, a, relationship, with, another, such, that, one, is, restored, to, peace, and, ideally, to, what, psychologist, carl, rogers, has, referred, to, as, unconditional, positive, regard, towards, the, other, forgiveness, can, seal, off, a, past, wrongdoing, and, remove, it, from, the, present, as, a, psychological, concept, and, as, a, virtue, the, obligation, to, forgive, and, the, benefits, of, forgiveness, have, been, explored, in, religious, thought, moral, philosophy, social, sciences, and, medicine, forgiveness, may, be, considered, simply, in, terms, of, the, person, who, forgives, which, may, include, forgiving, themselves, this, can, be, in, terms, of, the, person, forgiven, or, in, terms, of, the, relationship, between, the, forgiver, and, the, person, forgiven, in, most, contexts, forgiveness, is, granted, without, any, expectation, of, restorative, justice, and, without, any, response, on, the, part, of, the, offender, for, example, one, may, forgive, a, person, who, is, incommunicado, or, dead, in, practical, terms, it, may, be, necessary, for, the, offender, to, offer, some, form, of, acknowledgment, such, as, an, apology, or, to, explicitly, ask, for, forgiveness, in, order, for, the, wronged, person, to, believe, themselves, able, to, forgive, social, and, political, dimensions, of, forgiveness, involve, the, strictly, private, and, religious, sphere, of, forgiveness, the, notion, of, forgiveness, is, generally, considered, unusual, in, the, political, field, however, hannah, arendt, considers, that, the, faculty, of, forgiveness, has, its, place, in, public, affairs, she, believes, that, forgiveness, can, liberate, resources, both, individually, and, collectively, in, the, face, of, the, irreparable, by, freeing, people, to, act, in, ways, that, are, not, merely, reactive, to, the, original, wrong, forgiving, is, the, only, reaction, which, does, not, merely, re, act, but, acts, anew, and, unexpectedly, unconditioned, by, the, act, which, provoked, it, and, therefore, freeing, from, its, consequences, both, the, one, who, forgives, and, the, one, who, is, forgiven, in, a, study, conducted, in, rwanda, to, examine, the, discourses, and, practices, of, forgiveness, following, the, 1994, genocide, sociologist, benoit, guillou, highlighted, the, extensive, range, of, meanings, associated, with, the, term, forgiveness, and, its, underlying, political, nature, in, the, study, s, findings, the, author, presented, four, primary, aspects, of, forgiveness, to, facilitate, a, clearer, comprehension, of, both, its, multifaceted, applications, and, the, circumstances, in, which, forgiveness, can, contribute, to, the, restoration, of, social, connections, most, world, religions, include, teachings, on, forgiveness, and, many, of, these, provide, a, foundation, for, various, modern, traditions, and, practices, of, forgiveness, some, religious, doctrines, or, philosophies, emphasize, the, need, for, people, to, find, divine, forgiveness, for, their, shortcomings, others, place, greater, emphasis, on, the, need, for, people, to, forgive, one, another, yet, others, make, little, or, no, distinction, between, human, and, divine, forgiveness, forgiveness, is, interpreted, in, many, ways, by, different, people, and, cultures, this, is, important, in, relationship, oriented, communication, when, all, parties, share, a, mutual, view, of, forgiveness, then, a, relationship, can, be, maintained, understanding, antecedents, of, forgiveness, exploring, the, physiology, of, forgiveness, and, training, people, to, become, more, forgiving, all, imply, that, we, have, a, shared, meaning, for, the, term, as, of, 2006, there, is, no, consensus, for, a, psychological, definition, of, forgiveness, in, research, literature, however, there, is, agreement, that, forgiveness, is, a, process, and, a, number, of, models, describing, the, process, of, forgiveness, have, been, published, including, one, from, a, radical, behavioral, perspective, dr, robert, enright, from, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, founded, the, international, forgiveness, institute, and, initiated, forgiveness, studies, he, developed, a, 20, step, process, model, of, forgiveness, in, that, model, to, forgive, someone, you, should, examine, the, wrong, you, suffered, who, caused, it, and, the, context, in, which, it, happened, consider, the, anger, you, feel, about, it, any, shame, or, guilt, associated, with, it, and, how, it, has, affected, you, decide, whether, you, want, to, advance, into, an, attitude, of, forgiveness, and, if, so, work, on, understanding, compassion, and, acceptance, and, make, a, gesture, of, reconciliation, to, the, offender, then, reformulate, the, way, you, remember, your, experience, of, being, wronged, and, of, developing, forgiveness, in, ways, that, healthily, integrate, this, into, your, life, story, a, longitudinal, study, showed, that, people, who, were, generally, more, neurotic, angry, and, hostile, in, life, were, less, likely, to, forgive, another, person, even, after, a, long, time, had, passed, they, were, more, likely, to, avoid, their, transgressor, and, want, to, enact, revenge, upon, them, two, and, a, half, years, after, the, transgression, studies, show, that, people, who, forgive, are, happier, and, healthier, than, those, who, hold, resentments, the, first, study, to, look, at, how, forgiveness, improves, physical, health, discovered, that, when, people, think, about, forgiving, an, offender, their, cardiovascular, and, nervous, system, functioning, improves, another, study, found, the, more, forgiving, people, were, the, less, they, suffered, from, a, wide, range, of, illnesses, less, forgiving, people, reported, a, greater, number, of, health, problems, dr, fred, luskin, of, stanford, university, author, of, forgive, for, good, presented, evidence, that, forgiveness, can, be, learned, i, e, is, a, teachable, skill, with, practice, based, on, research, into, the, effects, of, teaching, forgiveness, this, research, gave, empirical, support, to, the, powerful, positive, health, effects, of, forgiveness, in, three, separate, studies, including, one, with, catholics, and, protestants, from, northern, ireland, whose, family, members, were, murdered, in, the, political, violence, he, found, that, people, who, are, taught, how, to, forgive, become, less, angry, feel, less, hurt, are, more, optimistic, become, more, forgiving, in, a, variety, of, situations, and, become, more, compassionate, and, self, confident, his, studies, show, a, reduction, in, experience, of, stress, in, physical, manifestations, of, stress, and, an, increase, in, vitality, psychologist, wanda, malcolm, in, women, s, reflections, on, the, complexities, of, forgiveness, outlines, reasons, why, forgiveness, takes, time, when, work, on, self, care, healing, takes, priority, i, e, therapy, medical, injuries, etc, when, issues, of, relational, safety, need, to, be, addressed, and, where, facilitating, forgiveness, may, be, premature, immediately, after, an, interpersonal, offense, malcolm, explains, that, premature, efforts, to, facilitate, forgiveness, may, be, a, sign, of, our, reluctance, to, witness, our, client, s, pain, and, suffering, and, may, unwittingly, reinforce, the, client, s, belief, that, the, pain, and, suffering, is, too, much, to, bear, and, must, be, suppressed, or, avoided, worthington, et, al, observed, that, anything, done, to, promote, forgiveness, has, little, impact, unless, substantial, time, is, spent, at, helping, participants, think, through, and, emotionally, experience, their, forgiveness, efforts, to, facilitate, forgiveness, may, be, premature, and, even, harmful, immediately, after, an, interpersonal, injury, the, philosopher, joseph, butler, fifteen, sermons, defined, forgiveness, as, overcoming, of, resentment, the, overcoming, of, moral, hatred, as, a, speech, act, and, as, forbearance, in, his, 1962, lecture, on, freedom, and, resentment, philosopher, p, f, strawson, described, forgiveness, as, a, rather, unfashionable, subject, in, moral, philosophy, at, that, time, religion, can, affect, how, someone, chooses, to, forgive, for, example, through, religious, activity, religious, affiliation, and, teachings, and, imitation, in, judaism, if, a, person, causes, harm, but, then, sincerely, and, honestly, apologizes, to, the, wronged, individual, and, tries, to, rectify, the, wrong, the, wronged, individual, is, encouraged, but, not, required, to, grant, forgiveness, it, is, forbidden, to, be, obdurate, and, not, allow, yourself, to, be, appeased, on, the, contrary, one, should, be, easily, pacified, and, find, it, difficult, to, become, angry, when, asked, by, an, offender, for, forgiveness, one, should, forgive, with, a, sincere, mind, and, a, willing, spirit, forgiveness, is, natural, to, the, seed, of, israel, in, judaism, one, must, go, to, those, he, has, harmed, in, order, to, be, entitled, to, forgiveness, one, who, sincerely, apologizes, three, times, for, a, wrong, committed, against, another, has, fulfilled, their, obligation, to, seek, forgiveness, this, means, that, in, judaism, a, person, cannot, obtain, forgiveness, from, god, for, wrongs, they, have, done, to, other, people, this, also, means, that, unless, the, victim, forgave, the, perpetrator, before, he, died, murder, is, unforgivable, in, judaism, and, they, will, answer, to, god, for, it, though, the, victims, family, and, friends, can, forgive, the, murderer, for, the, grief, they, caused, them, the, tefila, zaka, meditation, which, is, recited, just, before, yom, kippur, closes, with, the, following, i, know, that, there, is, no, one, so, righteous, that, they, have, not, wronged, another, financially, or, physically, through, deed, or, speech, this, pains, my, heart, within, me, because, wrongs, between, humans, and, their, fellow, are, not, atoned, by, yom, kippur, until, the, wronged, one, is, appeased, because, of, this, my, heart, breaks, within, me, and, my, bones, tremble, for, even, the, day, of, death, does, not, atone, for, such, sins, therefore, i, prostrate, and, beg, before, you, to, have, mercy, on, me, and, grant, me, grace, compassion, and, mercy, in, your, eyes, and, in, the, eyes, of, all, people, for, behold, i, forgive, with, a, final, and, resolved, forgiveness, anyone, who, has, wronged, me, whether, in, person, or, property, even, if, they, slandered, me, or, spread, falsehoods, against, me, so, i, release, anyone, who, has, injured, me, either, in, person, or, in, property, or, has, committed, any, manner, of, sin, that, one, may, commit, against, another, except, for, these, two, i, fully, and, finally, forgive, everyone, may, no, one, be, punished, because, of, me, and, just, as, i, forgive, everyone, so, may, you, grant, me, grace, in, the, eyes, of, others, that, they, too, forgive, me, absolutely, thus, the, reward, for, forgiving, others, is, not, god, s, forgiveness, for, wrongs, done, to, others, but, rather, help, in, obtaining, forgiveness, from, the, other, person, sir, jonathan, sacks, chief, rabbi, of, the, united, hebrew, congregations, of, the, commonwealth, summarized, it, is, not, that, god, forgives, while, human, beings, do, not, to, the, contrary, we, believe, that, just, as, only, god, can, forgive, sins, against, god, so, only, human, beings, can, forgive, sins, against, human, beings, jews, observe, a, day, of, atonement, yom, kippur, on, the, day, before, god, makes, decisions, regarding, what, will, happen, during, the, coming, year, just, prior, to, yom, kippur, jews, ask, forgiveness, of, those, they, have, wronged, during, the, prior, year, if, they, have, not, already, done, so, during, yom, kippur, itself, jews, fast, and, pray, for, god, s, forgiveness, for, the, transgressions, they, have, made, against, god, in, the, prior, year, sincere, repentance, is, required, and, once, again, god, can, only, forgive, one, for, the, sins, one, has, committed, against, god, this, is, why, it, is, necessary, for, jews, also, to, seek, the, forgiveness, of, those, people, who, they, have, wronged, blessed, are, the, merciful, for, they, shall, obtain, mercy, forgiveness, is, central, to, christian, ethics, the, prayer, jesus, taught, his, followers, to, recite, begs, god, to, forgive, us, our, debts, as, we, also, have, forgiven, our, debtors, when, peter, asked, jesus, how, often, to, forgive, someone, jesus, said, not, seven, times, but, i, tell, you, seventy, seven, times, jesus, warned, that, god, s, forgiveness, for, your, sins, depends, on, your, forgiveness, towards, others, in, one, of, the, gospels, jesus, during, his, crucifixion, asks, god, to, forgive, those, who, crucified, him, hannah, arendt, stated, that, jesus, was, the, discoverer, of, the, role, of, forgiveness, in, the, realm, of, human, affairs, unlike, in, judaism, in, christianity, god, can, forgive, sins, committed, by, people, against, people, since, he, can, forgive, every, sin, except, for, the, eternal, sin, and, forgiveness, from, one, s, victim, is, not, necessary, for, salvation, the, parable, of, the, prodigal, son, is, perhaps, the, best, known, parable, about, forgiveness, and, refers, to, god, s, forgiveness, for, those, who, repent, jesus, asked, for, god, s, forgiveness, of, those, who, crucified, him, then, jesus, said, father, forgive, them, for, they, do, not, know, what, they, are, doing, luke, 23, 34, forgiving, offenses, is, among, the, spiritual, works, of, mercy, and, forgiving, others, begets, being, forgiven, by, god, considering, mark, 11, 25, and, matthew, 6, 14, 15, that, follows, the, lord, s, prayer, for, if, you, forgive, others, their, trespasses, your, heavenly, father, will, also, forgive, you, but, if, you, do, not, forgive, others, neither, will, your, father, forgive, your, trespasses, forgiveness, is, not, an, option, to, a, christian, rather, one, must, forgive, to, be, a, christian, forgiveness, in, christianity, is, a, manifestation, of, submission, to, christ, and, fellow, believers, in, the, new, testament, jesus, speaks, of, the, importance, of, forgiving, or, showing, mercy, toward, others, this, is, based, on, the, belief, that, god, forgives, sins, through, faith, in, the, atoning, sacrifice, of, jesus, christ, in, his, death, 1, john, 2, 2, and, that, therefore, christians, should, forgive, others, ephesians, 4, 32, jesus, used, the, parable, of, the, unmerciful, servant, matthew, 18, 21, 35, to, show, that, his, followers, represented, in, the, parable, by, the, servant, should, forgive, because, god, represented, by, the, king, forgives, much, more, in, the, sermon, on, the, mount, jesus, repeatedly, spoke, of, forgiveness, blessed, are, the, merciful, for, they, will, receive, mercy, so, when, you, are, offering, your, gift, at, the, altar, if, you, remember, that, your, brother, or, sister, has, something, against, you, leave, your, gift, there, before, the, altar, and, go, first, be, reconciled, to, your, brother, or, sister, and, then, come, and, offer, your, gift, whenever, you, stand, praying, forgive, if, you, have, anything, against, anyone, so, that, your, father, in, heaven, may, also, forgive, you, your, trespasses, be, merciful, just, as, your, father, is, merciful, do, not, judge, and, you, will, not, be, judged, do, not, condemn, and, you, will, not, be, condemned, forgive, and, you, will, be, forgiven, elsewhere, it, is, said, then, peter, came, and, said, to, him, lord, if, my, brother, or, sister, sins, against, me, how, often, should, i, forgive, as, many, as, seven, times, jesus, said, to, him, not, seven, times, but, i, tell, you, seventy, seven, times, pope, benedict, xvi, on, a, visit, to, lebanon, in, 2012, insisted, that, peace, must, be, based, on, mutual, forgiveness, only, forgiveness, given, and, received, can, lay, lasting, foundations, for, reconciliation, and, universal, peace, pope, francis, during, a, general, audience, explained, forgiving, others, as, god, forgives, oneself, islam, teaches, that, allah, is, al, ghaffur, the, oft, forgiving, and, is, the, original, source, of, all, forgiveness, ghufran, seeking, forgiveness, from, allah, with, repentance, is, a, virtue, allah, has, forgiven, what, has, been, done, but, those, who, persist, will, be, punished, by, allah, and, allah, is, almighty, capable, of, punishment, islam, recommends, forgiveness, because, allah, values, forgiveness, there, are, numerous, verses, in, quran, and, the, hadiths, recommending, forgiveness, islam, also, allows, revenge, to, the, extent, of, the, harm, done, but, forgiveness, is, encouraged, with, a, promise, of, reward, from, allah, the, reward, of, an, evil, deed, is, its, equivalent, but, whoever, pardons, and, seeks, reconciliation, then, their, reward, is, with, allah, he, certainly, does, not, like, the, wrongdoers, afw, is, another, term, for, forgiveness, in, islam, it, occurs, 35, times, in, quran, and, in, some, islamic, theological, studies, it, is, used, interchangeably, with, ghufran, afw, means, to, pardon, to, excuse, for, a, fault, or, an, offense, according, to, muhammad, amanullah, forgiveness, afw, in, islam, is, derived, from, three, wisdoms, the, first, and, most, important, wisdom, of, forgiveness, is, that, it, is, merciful, when, the, victim, or, guardian, of, the, victim, accepts, money, instead, of, revenge, the, second, wisdom, of, forgiveness, is, that, it, increases, the, honor, and, prestige, of, the, one, who, forgives, forgiveness, is, not, a, sign, of, weakness, humiliation, or, dishonor, rather, forgiveness, is, honorable, it, raises, the, merit, of, the, forgiver, in, the, eyes, of, allah, and, it, enables, a, forgiver, to, enter, paradise, the, third, wisdom, of, forgiveness, is, that, according, to, scholars, such, as, al, tabari, and, al, qurtubi, forgiveness, expiates, kaffarah, the, forgiver, from, the, sins, they, may, have, committed, at, other, occasions, in, life, forgiveness, is, a, form, of, charity, sadaqat, forgiveness, comes, from, taqwa, piety, a, quality, of, god, fearing, people, in, the, bah, writings, this, explanation, is, given, of, how, to, be, forgiving, toward, others, love, the, creatures, for, the, sake, of, god, and, not, for, themselves, you, will, never, become, angry, or, impatient, if, you, love, them, for, the, sake, of, god, humanity, is, not, perfect, there, are, imperfections, in, every, human, being, and, you, will, always, become, unhappy, if, you, look, toward, the, people, themselves, but, if, you, look, toward, god, you, will, love, them, and, be, kind, to, them, for, the, world, of, god, is, the, world, of, perfection, and, complete, mercy, therefore, do, not, look, at, the, shortcomings, of, anybody, see, with, the, sight, of, forgiveness, in, buddhism, forgiveness, prevents, harmful, thoughts, from, causing, havoc, on, one, s, mental, well, being, buddhism, recognizes, that, feelings, of, hatred, and, ill, will, leave, a, lasting, effect, on, our, mind, karma, buddhism, encourages, the, cultivation, of, thoughts, that, leave, a, more, wholesome, effect, in, contemplating, the, law, of, karma, we, realize, that, it, is, not, a, matter, of, seeking, revenge, but, of, practicing, mett, and, forgiveness, for, the, victimizer, is, truly, the, most, unfortunate, of, all, when, resentments, have, already, arisen, the, buddhist, view, is, to, calmly, proceed, to, release, them, by, going, back, to, their, roots, buddhism, centers, on, release, from, delusion, and, suffering, through, meditation, and, receiving, insight, into, the, nature, of, reality, buddhism, questions, the, reality, of, the, passions, that, make, forgiveness, necessary, as, well, as, the, reality, of, the, objects, of, those, passions, if, we, haven, t, forgiven, we, keep, creating, an, identity, around, our, pain, and, that, is, what, is, reborn, that, is, what, suffers, buddhism, places, much, emphasis, on, the, concepts, of, mett, loving, kindness, karuna, compassion, mudita, sympathetic, joy, and, upekkh, equanimity, as, a, means, to, avoiding, resentments, in, the, first, place, these, reflections, are, used, to, understand, the, context, of, suffering, in, the, world, both, our, own, and, the, suffering, of, others, he, abused, me, he, struck, me, he, overcame, me, he, robbed, me, in, those, who, harbor, such, thoughts, hatred, will, never, cease, he, abused, me, he, struck, me, he, overcame, me, he, robbed, me, in, those, who, do, not, harbor, such, thoughts, hatred, will, cease, in, vedic, literature, and, epics, of, hinduism, ksama, or, kshyama, sanskrit, and, fusion, words, based, on, it, name, the, concept, of, forgiveness, the, word, ksama, is, often, combined, with, kripa, tenderness, daya, kindness, and, karuna, compassion, in, sanskrit, texts, in, the, rigveda, forgiveness, is, discussed, in, verses, dedicated, to, the, deity, varuna, both, the, context, of, the, one, who, has, done, wrong, and, the, one, who, is, wronged, forgiveness, is, considered, one, of, the, six, cardinal, virtues, in, hindu, dharma, the, theological, basis, for, forgiveness, in, hindu, dharma, is, that, a, person, who, does, not, forgive, carries, baggage, of, memories, of, the, wrong, of, negative, feelings, and, of, anger, and, unresolved, emotions, that, affect, their, present, as, well, as, future, in, hindu, dharma, not, only, should, one, forgive, others, but, one, must, also, seek, forgiveness, if, one, has, wronged, someone, else, forgiveness, is, to, be, sought, from, the, individual, wronged, as, well, as, society, at, large, by, means, of, charity, purification, fasting, rituals, and, meditative, introspection, forgiveness, is, further, refined, in, hindu, dharma, by, rhetorically, contrasting, it, in, feminine, and, masculine, form, in, feminine, form, one, form, of, forgiveness, is, explained, through, lakshmi, called, goddess, sri, in, some, parts, of, india, the, other, form, is, explained, in, the, masculine, form, through, her, husband, vishnu, feminine, lakshmi, forgives, even, when, the, one, who, does, wrong, does, not, repent, masculine, vishnu, on, the, other, hand, forgives, only, when, the, wrongdoer, repents, in, hindu, dharma, the, feminine, forgiveness, granted, without, repentance, by, lakshmi, is, higher, and, more, noble, than, the, masculine, forgiveness, granted, only, after, there, is, repentance, in, the, hindu, epic, ramayana, sita, the, wife, of, king, rama, is, symbolically, eulogized, for, forgiving, a, crow, even, as, it, harms, her, later, in, the, epic, ramayana, she, is, eulogized, again, for, forgiving, those, who, harass, her, while, she, has, been, kidnapped, in, lanka, many, other, hindu, stories, discuss, forgiveness, with, or, without, repentance, the, concept, of, forgiveness, is, treated, in, extensive, debates, within, hindu, literature, in, some, hindu, texts, certain, sins, and, intentional, acts, are, debated, as, naturally, unforgivable, for, example, murder, and, rape, these, ancient, scholars, argue, whether, blanket, forgiveness, is, morally, justifiable, in, every, circumstance, and, whether, forgiveness, encourages, crime, disrespect, social, disorder, and, people, not, taking, you, seriously, other, ancient, hindu, texts, highlight, that, forgiveness, is, not, the, same, as, reconciliation, forgiveness, in, hindu, dharma, does, not, necessarily, require, that, one, reconcile, with, the, offender, nor, does, it, rule, out, reconciliation, in, some, situations, instead, forgiveness, in, hindu, philosophy, is, being, compassionate, tender, kind, and, letting, go, of, the, harm, or, hurt, caused, by, someone, or, something, else, forgiveness, is, essential, for, one, to, free, oneself, from, negative, thoughts, and, to, be, able, to, focus, on, blissfully, living, a, moral, and, ethical, life, a, dharmic, life, in, the, highest, self, realized, state, forgiveness, becomes, the, essence, of, one, s, personality, where, the, persecuted, person, remains, unaffected, without, agitation, without, feeling, like, a, victim, free, from, anger, akrodhi, other, epics, and, ancient, literature, of, hindu, dharma, discuss, forgiveness, for, example, forgiveness, is, virtue, forgiveness, is, sacrifice, forgiveness, is, the, vedas, forgiveness, is, the, shruti, forgiveness, protecteth, the, ascetic, merit, of, the, future, forgiveness, is, asceticism, forgiveness, is, holiness, and, by, forgiveness, is, it, that, the, universe, is, held, together, righteousness, is, the, one, highest, good, forgiveness, is, the, one, supreme, peace, knowledge, is, one, supreme, contentment, and, benevolence, one, sole, happiness, janak, asked, oh, lord, how, does, one, attain, wisdom, how, does, liberation, happen, ashtavakra, replied, oh, beloved, if, you, want, liberation, then, renounce, imagined, passions, as, poison, take, forgiveness, innocence, compassion, contentment, and, truth, as,

reconciliation, and, forgiveness, combined, with, prayer, similar, forgiveness, practices, were, performed, on, islands, throughout, the, south, pacific, including, samoa, tahiti, and, new, zealand, traditionally, ho, oponopono, is, practiced, by, healing, priests, or, kahuna, lapa, au, among, family, members, of, a, person, who, is, physically, ill, modern, versions, are, performed, within, the, family, by, a, family, elder, or, by, the, individual, alone, the, need, to, forgive, is, widely, recognized, but, people, are, often, at, a, loss, for, ways, to, accomplish, it, for, example, in, a, large, representative, sampling, of, american, people, on, various, religious, topics, in, 1988, the, gallup, organization, found, that, 94, said, it, was, important, to, forgive, but, 85, said, they, needed, some, outside, help, to, be, able, to, forgive, however, not, even, regular, prayer, was, found, to, be, effective, akin, to, forgiveness, is, mercy, so, even, if, a, person, is, not, able, to, complete, the, forgiveness, process, they, can, still, show, mercy, especially, when, so, many, wrongs, are, done, out, of, weakness, rather, than, malice, the, gallup, poll, revealed, that, the, only, thing, that, was, effective, was, meditative, prayer, forgiveness, as, a, tool, has, been, extensively, used, in, such, areas, as, restorative, justice, programs, after, the, abolition, of, apartheid, in, the, truth, and, reconciliation, process, among, victims, and, perpetrators, of, rwandan, genocide, in, response, to, the, violence, in, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, and, the, northern, ireland, conflict, this, has, been, documented, in, the, film, beyond, right, and, wrong, stories, of, justice, and, forgiveness, 2012, forgiveness, is, associated, with, the, theory, of, emotion, because, it, draws, from, a, person, s, emotional, connection, with, the, situation, forgiveness, is, something, that, most, people, are, taught, to, understand, and, practice, at, a, young, age, forgiveness, in, marriage, is, important, when, two, people, can, forgive, each, other, this, contributes, to, a, happy, marriage, forgiveness, can, help, prevent, problems, from, growing, in, a, 2005, study, researchers, investigated, whether, forgiveness, is, important, in, a, marriage, when, does, forgiveness, usually, accrue, before, an, argument, or, after, an, argument, does, forgiveness, take, a, role, when, a, person, breaks, a, promise, etc, researchers, found, six, components, that, were, related, to, forgiveness, in, marriage, satisfaction, ambivalence, conflict, attributions, empathy, and, commitment, people, in, a, relationship, believe, that, forgiveness, means, you, must, forget, what, had, happened, when, couples, forgive, their, spouses, they, sometimes, need, help, from, professionals, to, overcome, their, pain, that, might, remain, researchers, described, differences, between, how, each, individual, perceives, the, situation, based, on, who, is, in, pain, and, who, caused, the, pain, the, act, and, effects, of, forgiveness, can, vary, depending, on, the, relationship, status, between, people, whether, you, are, married, friends, or, acquaintances, the, process, of, forgiving, is, similar, but, not, completely, the, same, enright, s, model, of, forgiveness, has, received, empirical, support, and, sees, forgiveness, as, a, journey, through, four, phases, when, married, couples, argue, they, tend, to, focus, on, who, is, right, and, who, is, wrong, the, researchers, also, came, up, with, recommendations, for, practitioners, and, interventions, to, help, married, individuals, communicate, with, each, other, to, resolve, problems, and, to, forgive, each, other, more, easily, for, example, people, should, explore, and, understand, what, forgiveness, means, before, starting, any, intervention, because, preconceived, ideas, of, forgiveness, can, cause, problems, with, couples, being, open, to, forgive, for, example, a, person, not, forgiving, their, spouse, out, of, fear, that, the, spouse, might, think, that, they, are, weak, can, cause, a, conflict, in, 2001, charlotte, van, oyen, witvliet, asked, people, to, think, about, someone, who, had, hurt, wronged, or, offended, them, as, they, thought, to, answer, she, observed, their, reaction, she, observed, their, blood, pressure, heart, rate, facial, muscle, tension, and, sweat, gland, activity, recalling, the, grudge, increased, the, candidates, blood, pressure, and, heart, rate, and, they, sweated, more, the, rumination, was, stressful, and, unpleasant, when, they, adopted, forgiveness, they, showed, no, more, of, an, anxiety, reaction, than, normal, wakefulness, produces, psychology, researchers, agree, that, the, purpose, of, forgiveness, interventions, is, to, decrease, overall, negative, affect, associated, with, the, stimulus, and, increase, the, individual, s, positive, affect, the, incorporation, of, forgiveness, into, therapy, has, been, lacking, but, has, gained, popularity, the, growth, of, forgiveness, in, psychology, has, given, rise, to, the, study, of, forgiveness, interventions, a, meta, analysis, of, group, based, forgiveness, interventions, examined, how, well, they, increase, self, reported, forgiveness, or, decrease, unforgiveness, it, concluded, that, the, data, appear, to, speak, clearly, forgiveness, interventions, are, effective, there, are, various, forms, of, forgiveness, interventions, one, is, where, patients, are, forced, to, confront, the, entity, that, prevents, them, from, forgiving, by, using, introspective, techniques, and, expressing, this, to, the, therapist, another, is, getting, the, person, to, try, to, see, things, from, the, offender, s, point, of, view, so, that, they, may, understand, the, reasoning, behind, the, offender, s, actions, if, they, can, do, this, they, might, be, able, to, forgive, the, offender, more, easily, researchers, have, studied, forgiveness, interventions, in, relationships, and, whether, or, not, prayer, increases, forgiveness, one, study, found, that, praying, for, a, friend, or, thinking, positive, thoughts, about, that, person, every, day, for, four, weeks, positively, boosts, the, chances, of, forgiving, that, friend, or, partner, which, leads, to, a, better, relationship, there, is, however, conflicting, evidence, on, the, effectiveness, of, forgiveness, interventions, and, some, researchers, have, taken, a, critical, approach, to, the, forgiveness, intervention, approach, to, therapy, critics, argued, that, forgiveness, interventions, may, actually, cause, an, increase, in, negative, affect, because, they, try, to, inhibit, the, person, s, feelings, towards, the, offender, this, can, result, in, the, person, feeling, negatively, towards, themself, this, approach, implies, that, the, negative, emotions, the, person, is, feeling, are, unacceptable, and, feelings, of, forgiveness, are, correct, and, acceptable, this, might, inadvertently, promote, feelings, of, shame, and, contrition, in, the, person, wanda, malcolm, a, registered, psychologist, states, it, is, not, a, good, idea, to, make, forgiveness, an, a, priori, goal, of, therapy, steven, stosny, asserts, that, you, must, heal, first, then, forgive, not, forgive, then, heal, that, fully, acknowledging, the, grievance, both, what, actions, were, harmful, and, naming, the, emotions, the, victim, felt, as, a, response, to, the, offender, s, actions, is, an, essential, first, step, before, forgiveness, can, occur, some, researchers, worry, that, forgiveness, interventions, promote, unhealthy, relationships, they, worry, that, individuals, with, toxic, relationships, will, continue, to, forgive, those, who, continuously, commit, wrong, acts, towards, them, when, in, fact, they, should, be, distancing, themselves, from, those, sorts, of, people, a, number, of, studies, showcase, high, effectiveness, rates, of, forgiveness, interventions, when, done, continuously, over, a, long, period, of, time, but, some, researchers, have, found, these, interventions, ineffective, when, done, over, short, spans, of, time, some, studies, looked, at, the, effectiveness, of, forgiveness, interventions, on, young, children, including, several, cross, cultural, studies, one, looked, at, forgiveness, interventions, and, chinese, children, who, were, less, likely, to, forgive, those, who, had, wronged, them, finding, an, effect, of, such, interventions, on, the, children, older, adults, who, receive, forgiveness, interventions, report, higher, levels, of, forgiveness, than, those, who, did, not, receive, treatment, forgiveness, treatments, resulted, in, lower, depression, stress, and, anger, than, no, treatment, conditions, forgiveness, interventions, also, enhance, positive, psychological, aspects, this, was, regardless, of, the, specific, intervention, model, or, format, group, or, individual, survey, data, from, 2000, showed, that, 61, of, those, participants, who, were, part, of, a, small, religious, group, reported, that, the, group, helped, them, be, more, forgiving, people, who, reported, that, their, religious, groups, promoted, forgiveness, also, related, success, in, overcoming, addictions, guilt, and, perceiving, encouragement, when, feeling, discouraged, mindfulness, may, play, a, role, as, a, mediator, in, the, relationship, between, forgiveness, and, health, outcomes, when, combined, with, mindfulness, forgiveness, has, a, beneficial, impact, on, physical, health, however, the, effects, of, forgiveness, on, health, are, contingent, upon, the, presence, and, practice, of, mindfulness, self, forgiveness, is, an, important, part, of, self, acceptance, and, mental, health, in, stages, of, life, failing, to, achieve, self, forgiveness, can, have, negative, effects, on, mental, health, among, the, elderly, self, forgiveness, often, involves, introspection, about, past, wrongdoings, aiming, to, prevent, their, recurrence, this, process, contributes, to, enhancing, their, authentic, self, concept, when, people, successfully, learn, from, transgressions, they, may, experience, improved, mental, health, self, forgiveness, can, reduce, feelings, of, guilt, and, shame, associated, with, hypersexual, behavior, hypersexual, behaviour, can, cause, distress, and, life, problems, self, forgiveness, may, help, individuals, reduce, hypersexual, negative, behaviours, that, cause, problems, self, forgiveness, may, be, associated, with, procrastination, self, forgiveness, allows, a, person, to, overcome, the, negative, effects, linked, to, an, earlier, behaviour, and, adopt, proactive, approaches, toward, similar, tasks, embracing, self, forgiveness, in, the, context, of, procrastination, can, enhance, self, esteem, and, mental, well, being, potentially, leading, to, a, reduction, in, procrastination, tendencies, the, self, help, book, forgiveness, and, health, scientific, evidence, and, theories, relating, forgiveness, to, better, health, details, the, benefits, and, the, mental, physical, and, psychological, results, of, forgiveness, stress, relief, may, be, the, chief, factor, that, connects, forgiveness, and, well, being, levels, of, stress, go, down, when, levels, of, forgiveness, rise, resulting, in, a, decrease, in, mental, health, symptoms, forgiveness, lifts, a, burden, as, the, forgiver, no, longer, feels, anger, or, hatred, toward, the, transgressor, and, may, better, understand, the, transgressor, this, improves, their, health, and, outlook, a, meta, analysis, of, several, controlled, studies, of, forgiveness, oriented, psychological, interventions, tried, to, determine, whether, certain, classes, of, intervention, helped, people, to, forgive, and, also, whether, this, helped, their, emotional, health, in, general, it, found, strong, support, for, forgiveness, interventions, that, helped, people, go, through, a, multi, step, process, of, forgiveness, but, no, support, for, forgiveness, interventions, that, were, designed, merely, to, help, people, decide, to, forgive, another, meta, analysis, examined, how, forgiveness, interventions, affected, depression, anxiety, and, hopelessness, and, concluded, that, interventions, designed, to, promote, forgiveness, are, more, effective, at, helping, participants, achieve, forgiveness, and, hope, and, reduce, depression, and, anxiety, than, either, no, treatment, or, alternative, treatments, some, studies, claim, that, there, is, no, correlation, either, positive, or, negative, between, forgiveness, and, physical, health, and, others, show, a, positive, correlation, people, characterized, by, the, personality, trait, of, forgiveness, tend, to, experience, better, physical, health, a, study, focusing, on, relationships, revealed, that, the, level, of, forgiveness, exhibited, by, individuals, had, a, discernible, impact, on, their, physical, well, being, regardless, of, whether, they, were, in, positive, or, negative, relationships, people, who, decide, to, genuinely, forgive, someone, also, have, better, physical, health, this, is, due, to, the, relationship, between, forgiveness, and, stress, reduction, forgiveness, prevents, poor, physical, health, and, manages, good, physical, health, people, who, choose, to, forgive, another, have, lower, blood, pressure, and, lower, cortisol, levels, than, those, who, do, not, this, is, theorized, to, be, due, to, forgiveness, and, suggests, forgiveness, is, an, evolutionarily, selected, trait, direct, influences, of, forgiveness, include, reducing, hostility, which, is, inversely, correlated, with, physical, health, and, that, unforgiveness, may, degrade, the, immune, system, because, it, puts, stress, on, the, individual, indirect, influences, are, more, related, to, forgiveness, as, a, personality, trait, and, include, people, who, are, forgiving, may, have, more, social, support, and, less, stressful, marriages, and, forgiveness, may, be, related, to, other, personality, traits, that, correlate, with, physical, health, forgiveness, may, also, correlate, with, physical, health, because, hostility, is, associated, with, poor, coronary, performance, unforgiveness, is, a, sort, of, hostility, and, forgiveness, is, letting, go, of, hostility, heart, patients, who, are, treated, with, therapy, that, includes, forgiveness, to, reduce, hostility, have, improved, cardiac, health, compared, to, those, who, are, treated, with, medicine, alone, forgiveness, may, also, lead, to, better, perceived, physical, health, this, correlation, applies, to, both, self, forgiveness, and, other, forgiveness, but, is, especially, true, of, self, forgiveness, individuals, who, are, more, capable, of, forgiving, themselves, have, better, perceived, physical, health, people, who, forgive, can, have, healthier, hearts, fewer, depression, symptoms, and, less, anxiety, forgiveness, can, help, mental, health, especially, with, people, who, have, mental, disorders, forgiveness, can, also, improve, the, immune, system, forgiveness, studies, have, been, refuted, by, critics, who, claim, that, there, is, no, direct, correlation, between, forgiveness, and, physical, health, forgiveness, due, to, the, reduction, of, directed, anger, contributes, to, mental, health, and, mental, health, contributes, to, physical, health, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, forgiveness, itself, directly, improves, physical, health, most, of, the, studies, on, forgiveness, cannot, isolate, it, as, an, independent, variable, in, an, individual, s, well, being, so, it, is, difficult, to, prove, causation, although, there, is, limited, research, directly, linking, forgiveness, to, physical, health, there, are, certain, factors, that, suggest, a, potential, connection, this, is, particularly, relevant, to, physiological, indicators, and, how, the, process, of, forgiveness, may, affect, the, body, s, responses, in, various, situations, throughout, daily, life, research, into, the, correlation, between, physical, health, and, forgiveness, has, been, criticized, for, being, too, focused, on, unforgiveness, research, shows, more, about, what, hostility, and, unforgiveness, contribute, to, poor, health, than, it, shows, about, what, forgiveness, contributes, to, good, health, unforgiving, or, holding, grudges, can, contribute, to, adverse, health, outcomes, by, perpetuating, anger, and, heightening, sns, arousal, and, cardiovascular, reactivity, expression, of, anger, has, been, strongly, associated, with, chronically, elevated, blood, pressure, and, with,

perceive, to, be, morally, wrong, and, that, they, consider, themselves, to, be, responsible, for, self, forgiveness, is, the, overcoming, of, negative, emotions, that, the, wrongdoer, associates, with, the, wrongful, action, which, can, include, guilt, regret, remorse, blame, shame, self, hatred, and, or, self, contempt, major, life, events, that, include, trauma, can, cause, individuals, to, experience, feelings, of, guilt, or, self, hatred, people, can, reflect, on, their, behaviours, to, determine, if, their, actions, are, moral, in, situations, of, trauma, people, may, self, forgive, by, allowing, themselves, to, change, and, live, a, moral, life, self, forgiveness, may, be, required, in, situations, where, the, individual, hurt, themselves, or, in, situations, where, they, hurt, others, self, forgiveness, has, a, moderating, effect, between, depression, and, suicidality, this, suggests, that, self, forgiveness, up, to, a, point, is, protective, against, suicide, hinting, at, possible, prevention, strategies, people, can, unintentionally, cause, harm, or, offence, to, one, another, it, is, important, that, individuals, recognize, when, this, happens, and, in, the, process, of, making, amends, to, self, forgive, the, ability, to, forgive, oneself, can, benefit, a, person, s, emotional, and, mental, well, being, the, ability, to, forgive, oneself, for, past, offences, can, lessen, negative, emotions, such, as, shame, and, guilt, and, can, increase, positive, practices, such, as, self, kindness, and, self, compassion, however, the, process, of, self, forgiveness, may, be, misinterpreted, and, therefore, not, accurately, completed, this, could, lead, to, increased, feelings, of, regret, or, self, blame, to, avoid, this, and, to, increase, the, positive, benefits, associated, with, genuine, self, forgiveness, a, specific, therapeutic, model, of, self, forgiveness, can, be, used, to, encourage, genuine, self, forgiveness, the, proposed, model, has, four, key, elements, responsibility, remorse, restoration, and, renewal, the, process, of, self, forgiveness, is, not, always, applicable, for, every, person, for, example, people, who, have, not, actually, caused, others, any, harm, or, wrongdoing, but, instead, suffer, from, negative, emotions, such, as, self, hatred, or, self, pity, such, as, victims, of, assault, might, attempt, self, forgiveness, for, their, perceived, offences, however, this, would, not, be, the, process, necessary, for, them, to, make, their, amends, additionally, offenders, who, continue, to, offend, while, attempting, to, forgive, themselves, for, past, offences, demonstrate, a, reluctance, to, genuinely, complete, the, four, stages, necessary, for, self, forgiveness, it, is, important, to, first, gather, exterior, information, about, the, persons, s, perceived, offences, as, well, as, their, needs, and, motivation, for, self, forgiveness, to, be, unapologetic, is, to, refuse, to, apologize, for, or, even, recognize, wrongdoings, he, relationship, between, apologies, and, the, adjectives, apologetic, and, unapologetic, is, not, quite, so, straightforward, choosing, to, forgive, someone, or, not, correlates, with, whether, or, not, that, person, is, truly, sorry, for, their, actions, forgiving, a, person, who, does, not, seem, remorseful, for, their, actions, can, be, difficult, but, may, loosen, the, grip, the, person, has, over, you, intrusive, thoughts, can, cause, the, person, who, wants, to, forgive, to, have, feelings, of, low, self, worth, and, to, endure, a, traumatic, phase, due, to, that, person, s, actions, going, through, a, negative, experience, can, cause, long, term, trauma, a, person, may, benefit, from, letting, go, and, accepting, what, has, happened, letting, go, does, not, erase, what, the, person, did, but, forgiveness, can, lead, to, inner, peace, from, the, lack, of, negative, emotion, within, despite, the, other, person, not, apologizing, sincerely, forgiving, them, may, be, the, solution, to, problems, and, result, in, loving, one, s, self, jean, hampton, sees, the, decision, to, forgive, the, unrepentant, wrongdoer, as, expressing,
