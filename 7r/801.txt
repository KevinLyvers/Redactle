attractions, such, as, the, maitland, gaol, officially, the, term, correctional, centre, is, used, for, almost, all, prisons, in, new, south, wales, and, queensland, while, other, states, and, territories, use, a, variety, of, names, prison, is, officially, used, for, some, facilities, in, south, australia, victoria, and, western, australia, youth, prisons, in, australia, are, referred, to, as, youth, correctional, facilities, or, youth, detention, centres, among, other, names, depending, on, the, jurisdiction, in, canada, while, the, terms, jail, and, prison, are, commonly, used, in, speech, officially, named, facilities, use, facility, correctional, centre, penitentiary, or, institution, a, number, of, facilities, retain, their, historical, designation, as, a, jail, the, use, of, prisons, can, be, traced, back, to, the, rise, of, the, state, as, a, form, of, social, organization, some, ancient, greek, philosophers, such, as, plato, began, to, develop, ideas, of, using, punishment, to, reform, offenders, instead, of, for, retribution, imprisonment, as, a, penalty, was, used, initially, for, those, who, could, not, afford, to, pay, their, fines, eventually, since, impoverished, athenians, could, not, pay, their, fines, leading, to, indefinite, periods, of, imprisonment, time, limits, were, set, instead, the, prison, in, ancient, athens, was, known, as, the, desmoterion, place, of, chains, the, romans, were, among, the, first, to, use, prisons, as, a, form, of, punishment, rather, than, simply, for, detention, a, variety, of, existing, structures, were, used, to, house, prisoners, such, as, metal, cages, basements, of, public, buildings, and, quarries, one, of, the, most, notable, roman, prisons, was, the, mamertine, prison, established, around, 640, b, c, by, ancus, marcius, the, mamertine, prison, was, located, within, a, sewer, system, beneath, ancient, rome, and, contained, a, large, network, of, dungeons, where, prisoners, were, held, in, squalid, conditions, contaminated, with, human, waste, forced, labor, on, public, works, projects, was, also, a, common, form, of, punishment, in, many, cases, citizens, were, sentenced, to, slavery, often, in, ergastula, a, primitive, form, of, prison, where, unruly, slaves, were, chained, to, workbenches, and, performed, hard, labor, in, medieval, songhai, results, of, a, trial, could, have, led, to, confiscation, of, merchandise, or, imprisonment, as, a, form, of, punishment, since, various, prisons, existed, in, the, empire, during, the, middle, ages, in, europe, castles, fortresses, and, the, basements, of, public, buildings, were, often, used, as, makeshift, prisons, the, capability, to, imprison, citizens, granted, an, air, of, legitimacy, to, officials, at, all, levels, of, government, and, served, as, a, signifier, of, who, possessed, power, or, authority, over, others, another, common, punishment, was, sentencing, people, to, galley, slavery, which, involved, chaining, prisoners, together, in, the, bottoms, of, ships, and, forcing, them, to, row, on, naval, or, merchant, vessels, the, french, philosopher, michel, foucault, especially, his, book, discipline, and, punish, the, birth, of, the, prison, 1975, energized, the, historical, study, of, prisons, and, their, role, in, the, overall, social, system, the, book, analyzed, changes, in, western, penal, systems, during, the, modern, age, based, on, historical, documents, from, france, foucault, argues, that, prison, did, not, become, the, principal, form, of, punishment, just, because, of, the, humanitarian, concerns, of, reformists, he, traces, the, cultural, shifts, that, led, to, the, predominance, of, prison, via, the, body, and, power, prison, used, by, the, disciplines, new, technological, powers, that, can, be, found, according, to, foucault, in, places, such, as, schools, hospitals, and, military, barracks, from, the, late, 17th, century, and, during, the, 18th, century, popular, resistance, to, public, execution, and, torture, became, more, widespread, both, in, europe, and, in, the, united, states, particularly, under, the, bloody, code, with, few, sentencing, alternatives, imposition, of, the, death, penalty, for, petty, crimes, such, as, theft, was, proving, increasingly, unpopular, with, the, public, many, jurors, were, refusing, to, convict, defendants, of, petty, crimes, when, they, knew, the, defendants, would, be, sentenced, to, death, rulers, began, looking, for, means, to, punish, and, control, their, subjects, in, a, way, that, did, not, cause, people, to, associate, them, with, spectacles, of, tyrannical, and, sadistic, violence, they, developed, systems, of, mass, incarceration, often, with, hard, labor, as, a, solution, the, prison, reform, movement, that, arose, at, this, time, was, heavily, influenced, by, two, somewhat, contradictory, philosophies, the, first, was, based, in, enlightenment, ideas, of, utilitarianism, and, rationalism, and, suggested, that, prisons, should, simply, be, used, as, a, more, effective, substitute, for, public, corporal, punishments, such, as, whipping, hanging, etc, this, theory, referred, to, as, deterrence, claims, that, the, primary, purpose, of, prisons, is, to, be, so, harsh, and, terrifying, that, they, deter, people, from, committing, crimes, out, of, fear, of, going, to, prison, the, second, theory, which, saw, prisons, as, a, form, of, rehabilitation, or, moral, reform, was, based, on, religious, ideas, that, equated, crime, with, sin, and, saw, prisons, as, a, place, to, instruct, prisoners, in, christian, morality, obedience, and, proper, behavior, these, later, reformers, believed, that, prisons, could, be, constructed, as, humane, institutions, of, moral, instruction, and, that, prisoners, behavior, could, be, corrected, so, that, when, they, were, released, they, would, be, model, members, of, society, the, concept, of, the, modern, prison, was, imported, to, europe, in, the, early, 19th, century, prior, forms, of, punishment, were, usually, physical, including, capital, punishment, mutilation, flagellation, whipping, branding, and, non, physical, punishments, such, as, public, shaming, rituals, like, the, stocks, from, the, middle, ages, up, to, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, in, europe, imprisonment, was, rarely, used, as, a, punishment, in, its, own, right, and, prisons, were, mainly, to, hold, those, awaiting, trial, and, convicts, awaiting, punishment, however, an, important, innovation, at, the, time, was, the, bridewell, house, of, corrections, located, at, bridewell, palace, in, london, which, resulted, in, the, building, of, other, houses, of, correction, these, houses, held, mostly, petty, offenders, vagrants, and, the, disorderly, local, poor, in, these, facilities, the, inmates, were, given, prison, labor, jobs, that, were, anticipated, to, shape, them, into, hardworking, individuals, and, prepare, them, for, the, real, world, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, houses, of, correction, were, absorbed, into, local, prison, facilities, under, the, control, of, the, local, justice, of, the, peace, england, used, penal, transportation, of, convicted, criminals, and, others, generally, young, and, poor, for, a, term, of, indentured, servitude, within, the, general, population, of, british, america, between, the, 1610s, and, 1776, the, transportation, act, 1717, made, this, option, available, for, lesser, crimes, or, offered, it, by, discretion, as, a, longer, term, alternative, to, the, death, penalty, which, could, theoretically, be, imposed, for, the, growing, number, of, offenses, in, britain, the, substantial, expansion, of, transportation, was, the, first, major, innovation, in, eighteenth, century, british, penal, practice, transportation, to, america, was, abruptly, suspended, by, the, criminal, law, act, 1776, 16, geo, 3, c, 43, with, the, start, of, the, american, rebellion, while, sentencing, to, transportation, continued, the, act, instituted, a, punishment, policy, of, hard, labor, instead, the, suspension, of, transport, also, prompted, the, use, of, prisons, for, punishment, and, the, initial, start, of, a, prison, building, program, britain, would, resume, transportation, to, specifically, planned, penal, colonies, in, australia, between, 1788, and, 1868, jails, at, the, time, were, run, as, business, ventures, and, contained, both, felons, and, debtors, the, latter, were, often, housed, with, their, wives, and, younger, children, the, jailers, made, their, money, by, charging, the, inmates, for, food, drink, and, other, services, and, the, system, was, generally, corruptible, one, reform, of, the, seventeenth, century, was, the, establishment, of, the, london, bridewell, as, a, house, of, correction, for, women, and, children, it, was, the, first, facility, to, make, any, medical, services, available, to, prisoners, with, the, widely, used, alternative, of, penal, transportation, halted, in, the, 1770s, the, immediate, need, for, additional, penal, accommodations, emerged, given, the, undeveloped, institutional, facilities, old, sailing, vessels, termed, hulks, were, the, most, readily, available, and, expandable, choice, to, be, used, as, places, of, temporary, confinement, while, conditions, on, these, ships, were, generally, appalling, their, use, and, the, labor, thus, provided, set, a, precedent, which, persuaded, many, people, that, mass, incarceration, and, labor, were, viable, methods, of, crime, prevention, and, punishment, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, would, see, the, first, movement, toward, prison, reform, and, by, the, 1810s, the, first, state, prisons, and, correctional, facilities, were, built, thereby, inaugurating, the, modern, prison, facilities, available, today, france, also, sent, criminals, to, overseas, penal, colonies, including, louisiana, in, the, early, 18th, century, penal, colonies, in, french, guiana, operated, until, 1952, such, as, the, notable, devil, s, island, le, du, diable, katorga, prisons, were, harsh, work, camps, established, in, the, 17th, century, in, russia, in, remote, underpopulated, areas, of, siberia, and, the, russian, far, east, that, had, few, towns, or, food, sources, siberia, quickly, gained, its, fearful, connotation, of, punishment, john, howard, was, one, of, the, most, notable, early, prison, reformers, after, having, visited, several, hundred, prisons, across, great, britain, and, europe, in, his, capacity, as, high, sheriff, of, bedfordshire, he, published, the, state, of, the, prisons, in, 1777, he, was, particularly, appalled, to, discover, prisoners, who, had, been, acquitted, but, were, still, confined, because, they, could, not, pay, the, jailer, s, fees, he, proposed, wide, ranging, reforms, to, the, system, including, the, housing, of, each, prisoner, in, a, separate, cell, and, the, requirements, that, staff, should, be, professional, and, paid, by, the, government, that, outside, inspection, of, prisons, should, be, imposed, and, that, prisoners, should, be, provided, with, a, healthy, diet, and, reasonable, living, conditions, the, prison, reform, charity, the, howard, league, for, penal, reform, was, established, in, 1866, by, his, admirers, following, howard, s, agitation, the, penitentiary, act, was, passed, in, 1779, this, introduced, solitary, confinement, religious, instruction, a, labor, regime, and, proposed, two, state, penitentiaries, one, for, men, and, one, for, women, however, these, were, never, built, due, to, disagreements, in, the, committee, and, pressures, from, wars, with, france, and, jails, remained, a, local, responsibility, but, other, measures, passed, in, the, next, few, years, provided, magistrates, with, the, powers, to, implement, many, of, these, reforms, and, eventually, in, 1815, jail, fees, were, abolished, quakers, were, prominent, in, campaigning, against, and, publicizing, the, dire, state, of, the, prisons, at, the, time, elizabeth, fry, documented, the, conditions, that, prevailed, at, newgate, prison, where, the, ladies, section, was, overcrowded, with, women, and, children, some, of, whom, had, not, even, received, a, trial, the, inmates, did, their, own, cooking, and, washing, in, the, small, cells, in, which, they, slept, on, straw, in, 1816, fry, founded, a, prison, school, for, the, children, who, were, imprisoned, with, their, parents, she, also, began, a, system, of, supervision, and, required, the, women, to, sew, and, to, read, the, bible, in, 1817, she, helped, to, found, the, association, for, the, reformation, of, the, female, prisoners, in, newgate, the, theory, of, the, modern, prison, system, was, born, in, london, influenced, by, the, utilitarianism, of, jeremy, bentham, bentham, s, panopticon, introduced, the, principle, of, observation, and, control, that, underpins, the, design, of, the, modern, prison, the, notion, of, prisoners, being, incarcerated, as, part, of, their, punishment, and, not, simply, as, a, holding, state, until, trial, or, hanging, was, at, the, time, revolutionary, his, views, influenced, the, establishment, of, the, first, prisons, used, as, criminal, rehabilitation, centers, at, a, time, when, the, implementation, of, capital, punishment, for, a, variety, of, relatively, trivial, offenses, was, on, the, decline, the, notion, of, incarceration, as, a, form, of, punishment, and, correction, held, great, appeal, to, reform, minded, thinkers, and, politicians, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, capital, punishment, came, to, be, regarded, as, inappropriate, for, many, crimes, that, it, had, previously, been, carried, out, for, and, by, the, mid, 19th, century, imprisonment, had, replaced, the, death, penalty, for, the, most, serious, offenses, except, for, murder, the, first, state, prison, in, england, was, the, millbank, prison, established, in, 1816, with, a, capacity, for, just, under, 1, 000, inmates, by, 1824, 54, prisons, had, adopted, the, disciplinary, system, advocated, by, the, sipd, by, the, 1840s, penal, transportation, to, australia, and, the, use, of, hulks, was, on, the, decline, and, the, surveyor, general, of, convict, prisons, joshua, jebb, set, an, ambitious, program, of, prison, building, in, the, country, with, one, large, prison, opening, per, year, pentonville, prison, opened, in, 1842, beginning, a, trend, of, ever, increasing, incarceration, rates, and, the, use, of, prison, as, the, primary, form, of, crime, punishment, robert, peel, s, gaols, act, of, 1823, introduced, regular, visits, to, prisoners, by, chaplains, provided, for, the, payment, of, jailers, and, prohibited, the, use, of, irons, and, manacles, in, 1786, the, state, of, pennsylvania, passed, a, law, that, mandated, that, all, convicts, who, had, not, been, sentenced, to, death, would, be, placed, in, penal, servitude, to, do, public, works, projects, such, as, building, roads, forts, and, mines, besides, the, economic, benefits, of, providing, a, free, source, of, hard, labor, the, proponents, of, the, new, penal, code, also, thought, that, this, would, deter, criminal, activity, by, making, a, conspicuous, public, example, of, consequences, of, breaking, the, law, however, what, actually, ended, up, happening, was, frequent, spectacles, of, disorderly, conduct, by, the, convict, work, crews, and, the, generation, of, sympathetic, feelings, from, the, citizens, who, witnessed, the, mistreatment, of, the, convicts, the, laws, quickly, drew, criticism, from, a, humanitarian, perspective, as, cruel, exploitative, and, degrading, and, from, a, utilitarian, perspective, as, failing, to, deter, crime, and, delegitimizing, the, state, in, the, eyes, of, the, public, reformers, such, as, benjamin, rush, came, up, with, a, solution, that, would, enable, the, continued, use, of, forced, labor, while, keeping, disorderly, conduct, and, abuse, out, of, the, eyes, of, the, public, they, suggested, that, prisoners, be, sent, to, secluded, houses, of, repentance, where, they, would, be, subjected, out, of, the, view, of, the, public, to, bodily, pain, labor, watchfulness, solitude, and, silence, joined, with, cleanliness, and, a, simple, diet, pennsylvania, soon, put, this, theory, into, practice, and, turned, its, old, jail, at, walnut, street, in, philadelphia, into, a, state, prison, in, 1790, this, prison, was, modeled, on, what, became, known, as, the, pennsylvania, system, or, separate, system, and, placed, all, prisoners, into, solitary, cells, with, nothing, other, than, religious, literature, made, them, wear, prison, uniforms, and, forced, them, to, be, completely, silent, to, reflect, on, their, wrongs, new, york, soon, built, the, newgate, state, prison, in, greenwich, village, which, was, modeled, on, the, pennsylvania, system, and, other, states, followed, but, by, 1820, faith, in, the, efficacy, of, legal, reform, had, declined, as, statutory, changes, had, no, discernible, effect, on, the, level, of, crime, and, the, prisons, where, prisoners, shared, large, rooms, and, booty, including, alcohol, had, become, riotous, and, prone, to, escapes, in, response, new, york, developed, the, auburn, system, in, which, prisoners, were, confined, in, separate, cells, and, prohibited, from, talking, when, eating, and, working, together, implementing, it, at, auburn, state, prison, and, sing, sing, at, ossining, the, aim, of, this, was, rehabilitative, the, reformers, talked, about, the, penitentiary, serving, as, a, model, for, the, family, and, the, school, and, almost, all, the, states, adopted, the, plan, though, pennsylvania, went, even, further, in, separating, prisoners, the, system, s, fame, spread, and, visitors, to, the, u, s, to, see, the, prisons, included, de, tocqueville, who, wrote, democracy, in, america, as, a, result, of, his, visit, the, use, of, prisons, in, continental, europe, was, never, as, popular, as, it, became, in, the, english, speaking, world, although, state, prison, systems, were, largely, in, place, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, most, european, countries, after, the, unification, of, italy, in, 1861, the, government, reformed, the, repressive, and, arbitrary, prison, system, they, inherited, and, modernized, and, secularized, criminal, punishment, by, emphasizing, discipline, and, deterrence, italy, developed, an, advanced, penology, under, the, leadership, of, cesare, lombroso, 1835, 1909, another, prominent, prison, reformer, who, made, important, contributions, was, alexander, paterson, who, advocated, for, the, necessity, of, humanizing, and, socializing, methods, within, the, prison, system, in, great, britain, and, america, prisons, employ, people, to, run, and, maintain, the, prison, while, keeping, control, of, the, inmates, oftentimes, the, number, of, people, employed, within, a, prison, depends, upon, factors, such, as, the, size, of, the, prison, how, many, inmates, the, prison, has, and, how, much, funding, the, prison, gets, staff, may, include, prisons, are, normally, surrounded, by, fencing, walls, earthworks, geographical, features, or, other, barriers, to, prevent, escape, multiple, barriers, concertina, wire, electrified, fencing, secured, and, defensible, main, gates, armed, guard, towers, security, lighting, motion, sensors, dogs, and, roving, patrols, may, all, also, be, present, depending, on, the, level, of, security, remotely, controlled, doors, cctv, monitoring, alarms, cages, restraints, nonlethal, and, lethal, weapons, riot, control, gear, and, physical, segregation, of, units, and, prisoners, may, all, also, be, present, within, a, prison, to, monitor, and, control, the, movement, and, activity, of, prisoners, within, the, facility, modern, prison, designs, have, increasingly, sought, to, restrict, and, control, the, movement, of, prisoners, throughout, the, facility, and, also, to, allow, a, smaller, prison, staff, to, monitor, prisoners, directly, often, using, a, decentralized, podular, layout, in, comparison, 19th, century, prisons, had, large, landings, and, cell, blocks, which, permitted, only, intermittent, observation, of, prisoners, smaller, separate, and, self, contained, housing, units, known, as, pods, or, modules, are, designed, to, hold, 16, to, 50, prisoners, and, are, arranged, around, exercise, yards, or, support, facilities, in, a, decentralized, campus, pattern, a, small, number, of, prison, officers, sometimes, a, single, officer, supervise, each, pod, the, pods, contain, tiers, of, cells, arranged, around, a, central, control, station, or, desk, from, which, a, single, officer, can, monitor, all, the, cells, and, the, entire, pod, control, cell, doors, and, communicate, with, the, rest, of, the, prison, pods, may, be, designed, for, high, security, indirect, supervision, in, which, officers, in, segregated, and, sealed, control, booths, monitor, smaller, numbers, of, prisoners, confined, to, their, cells, an, alternative, is, direct, supervision, in, which, officers, work, within, the, pod, and, directly, interact, with, and, supervise, prisoners, who, may, spend, the, day, outside, their, cells, in, a, central, dayroom, on, the, floor, of, the, pod, movement, in, or, out, of, the, pod, to, and, from, exercise, yards, work, assignments, or, medical, appointments, can, be, restricted, to, individual, pods, at, designated, times, and, is, generally, centrally, controlled, goods, and, services, such, as, meals, laundry, commissary, educational, materials, religious, services, and, medical, care, can, increasingly, be, brought, to, individual, pods, or, cells, as, well, some, modern, prisons, may, exclude, certain, inmates, from, the, general, population, usually, for, safety, reasons, such, as, those, within, solitary, confinement, celebrities, political, figures, and, former, law, enforcement, officers, those, convicted, of, sexual, crimes, and, or, crimes, against, children, or, those, on, the, medical, wing, or, protective, custody, generally, when, an, inmate, arrives, at, a, prison, they, go, through, a, security, classification, screening, and, risk, assessment, that, determines, where, they, will, be, placed, within, the, prison, system, classifications, are, assigned, by, assessing, the, prisoner, s, personal, history, and, criminal, record, and, through, subjective, determinations, made, by, intake, personnel, which, include, mental, health, workers, counselors, clerical, staff, sheriff, deputies, prison, unit, managers, and, others, this, process, will, have, a, major, impact, on, the, prisoner, s, experience, determining, their, security, level, educational, and, work, programs, mental, health, status, e, g, the, determination, of, whether, they, will, be, placed, in, a, mental, health, unit, and, many, other, factors, this, sorting, of, prisoners, is, one, of, the, fundamental, techniques, through, which, the, prison, administration, maintains, control, over, the, inmate, population, and, attempts, to, reduce, risks, and, liabilities, in, an, attempt, to, create, an, orderly, and, secure, prison, environment, at, some, prisons, prisoners, are, made, to, wear, a, prison, uniform, the, levels, of, security, within, a, prison, system, are, categorized, differently, around, the, world, but, tend, to, follow, a, distinct, pattern, at, one, end, of, the, spectrum, are, the, most, secure, facilities, maximum, security, which, typically, hold, prisoners, that, are, considered, dangerous, disruptive, or, likely, to, try, to, escape, furthermore, in, recent, times, supermax, prisons, have, been, created, where, the, custody, level, goes, beyond, maximum, security, for, people, such, as, terrorists, or, political, prisoners, deemed, a, threat, to, national, security, and, inmates, from, other, prisons, who, have, a, history, of, violent, or, other, disruptive, behavior, in, prison, or, are, suspected, of, gang, affiliation, these, inmates, have, individual, cells, and, are, kept, in, lockdown, often, for, more, than, 23, hours, per, day, meals, are, served, through, chuck, holes, in, the, cell, door, and, each, inmate, is, allowed, one, hour, of, outdoor, exercise, per, day, alone, they, are, normally, permitted, no, contact, with, other, inmates, and, are, under, constant, surveillance, via, closed, circuit, television, cameras, on, the, other, end, are, minimum, security, prisons, which, are, most, often, used, to, house, those, for, whom, more, stringent, security, is, deemed, unnecessary, for, example, prisoners, convicted, of, white, collar, crime, which, rarely, results, in, incarceration, are, almost, always, sent, to, minimum, security, prisons, due, to, them, having, committed, nonviolent, crimes, lower, security, prisons, are, often, designed, with, less, restrictive, features, confining, prisoners, at, night, in, smaller, locked, dormitories, or, even, cottage, or, cabin, like, housing, while, permitting, them, free, movement, around, the, grounds, to, work, or, partake, in, activities, during, the, day, some, countries, such, as, great, britain, also, have, open, prisons, where, prisoners, are, allowed, home, leave, or, part, time, employment, outside, of, the, prison, suomenlinna, island, facility, in, finland, is, an, example, of, one, such, open, correctional, facility, the, prison, has, been, open, since, 1971, and, as, of, september, 2013, the, facility, s, 95, male, prisoners, leave, the, prison, grounds, on, a, daily, basis, to, work, in, the, corresponding, township, or, commute, to, the, mainland, for, either, work, or, study, prisoners, can, rent, flat, screen, televisions, sound, systems, and, mini, refrigerators, with, the, prison, labor, wages, that, they, can, earn, wages, range, between, 4, 10, and, 7, 30, per, hour, with, electronic, monitoring, prisoners, are, also, allowed, to, visit, their, families, in, helsinki, and, eat, together, with, the, prison, staff, prisoners, in, scandinavian, facilities, are, permitted, to, wear, their, own, clothes, there, are, fundamental, differences, between, the, security, level, of, men, s, prisons, and, that, of, women, s, prisons, male, prisons, tend, to, have, higher, or, more, severe, security, levels, classifications, than, female, prisons, this, is, even, noticeable, when, comparing, the, construction, and, design, of, male, prisons, which, tend, to, have, very, tall, walls, and, towers, barbed, wire, and, other, serious, security, measures, whereas, these, types, of, high, level, security, measures, are, absent, at, many, female, prisons, this, is, due, to, multiple, factors, including, females, being, convicted, of, less, severe, offences, and, being, less, likely, to, be, convicted, of, violent, offences, in, comparison, to, males, and, due, to, female, prisoners, being, less, likely, to, be, violent, than, male, prisoners, modern, prisons, often, hold, hundreds, or, thousands, of, inmates, and, must, have, facilities, onsite, to, meet, most, of, their, needs, including, dietary, health, fitness, education, religious, practices, entertainment, and, many, others, conditions, in, prisons, vary, widely, around, the, world, and, the, types, of, facilities, within, prisons, depend, on, many, intersecting, factors, including, funding, legal, requirements, and, cultural, beliefs, practices, nevertheless, in, addition, to, the, cell, blocks, that, contain, the, prisoners, there, are, also, certain, auxiliary, facilities, that, are, common, in, prisons, throughout, the, world, prisons, generally, have, to, provide, food, for, a, large, number, of, individuals, and, thus, are, generally, equipped, with, a, large, institutional, kitchen, there, are, many, security, considerations, however, that, are, unique, to, the, prison, dining, environment, for, instance, cutlery, equipment, must, be, very, carefully, monitored, and, accounted, for, at, all, times, and, the, layout, of, prison, kitchens, must, be, designed, in, a, way, that, allows, staff, to, observe, activity, of, the, kitchen, staff, who, are, usually, prisoners, the, quality, of, kitchen, equipment, varies, from, prison, to, prison, depending, on, when, the, prison, was, constructed, and, the, level, of, funding, available, to, procure, new, equipment, prisoners, are, often, served, food, in, a, large, cafeteria, with, rows, of, tables, and, benches, that, are, securely, attached, to, the, floor, however, inmates, that, are, locked, in, control, units, or, prisons, that, are, on, lockdown, where, prisoners, are, made, to, remain, in, their, cells, all, day, have, trays, of, food, brought, to, their, cells, and, served, through, chuck, holes, in, the, cell, door, prison, food, in, many, developed, countries, is, nutritionally, adequate, for, most, inmates, prisons, in, wealthy, industrialized, nations, provide, medical, care, for, most, of, their, inmates, additionally, prison, medical, staff, play, a, major, role, in, monitoring, organizing, and, controlling, the, prison, population, through, the, use, of, psychiatric, evaluations, and, interventions, psychiatric, drugs, isolation, in, mental, health, units, etc, prison, populations, are, largely, from, poor, minority, communities, that, experience, greater, rates, of, chronic, illness, substance, abuse, and, mental, illness, than, the, general, population, this, leads, to, a, high, demand, for, medical, services, and, in, countries, such, as, the, us, that, do, not, provide, tax, payer, funded, healthcare, prison, is, often, the, first, place, that, people, are, able, to, receive, medical, treatment, which, they, could, not, afford, outside, some, prison, medical, facilities, include, primary, care, mental, health, services, dental, care, substance, abuse, treatment, and, other, forms, of, specialized, care, depending, on, the, needs, of, the, inmate, population, and, the, willingness, of, the, prison, to, provide, for, these, needs, health, care, services, in, many, prisons, have, long, been, criticized, as, inadequate, underfunded, and, understaffed, and, many, prisoners, have, experienced, abuse, and, mistreatment, at, the, hands, of, prison, medical, staff, who, are, entrusted, with, their, care, in, the, united, states, a, million, incarcerated, people, suffer, from, mental, illness, without, any, assistance, or, treatment, for, their, condition, the, tendency, of, a, convicted, criminal, to, reoffend, known, as, the, rate, of, recidivism, is, unusually, high, for, those, with, the, most, serious, disorders, analysis, of, data, in, 2000, from, several, forensic, hospitals, in, california, new, york, and, oregon, found, that, with, treatment, the, rate, of, recidivism, was, much, lower, than, for, untreated, mentally, ill, offenders, some, prisons, provide, educational, programs, for, inmates, that, can, include, basic, literacy, secondary, education, or, even, college, education, prisoners, seek, education, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, the, development, of, skills, for, after, release, personal, enrichment, and, curiosity, finding, something, to, fill, their, time, or, trying, to, please, prison, staff, which, can, often, secure, early, release, for, good, behavior, however, the, educational, needs, of, prisoners, often, come, into, conflict, with, the, security, concerns, of, prison, staff, and, with, a, public, that, wants, to, be, tough, on, crime, and, thus, supports, denying, prisoners, access, to, education, whatever, their, reasons, for, participating, in, educational, programs, prison, populations, tend, to, have, very, low, literacy, rates, and, lack, of, basic, mathematical, skills, and, many, have, not, completed, secondary, education, this, lack, of, basic, education, severely, limits, their, employment, opportunities, outside, of, prison, leading, to, high, rates, of, recidivism, and, research, has, shown, that, prison, education, can, play, a, significant, role, in, helping, prisoners, reorient, their, lives, and, become, successful, after, reentry, many, prisons, also, provide, a, library, where, prisoners, can, check, out, books, or, do, legal, research, for, their, cases, often, these, libraries, are, very, small, consisting, of, a, few, shelves, of, books, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, drastic, budget, cuts, have, resulted, in, many, prison, libraries, being, shut, down, meanwhile, many, nations, that, have, historically, lacked, prison, libraries, are, starting, to, develop, them, prison, libraries, can, dramatically, improve, the, quality, of, life, for, prisoners, who, have, large, amounts, of, empty, time, on, their, hands, that, can, be, occupied, with, reading, this, time, spent, reading, has, a, variety, of, benefits, including, improved, literacy, ability, to, understand, rules, and, regulations, leading, to, improved, behavior, ability, to, read, books, that, encourage, self, reflection, and, analysis, of, one, s, emotional, state, consciousness, of, important, real, world, events, and, education, that, can, lead, to, successful, re, entry, into, society, after, release, under, the, federal, bureau, of, prisons, in, the, united, states, all, prison, institutions, offer, literacy, programs, to, expand, inmates, educational, opportunities, some, scholars, in, the, field, see, prison, literacy, programs, as, organic, tactical, spaces, that, resist, institutionalization, they, warn, against, the, dehumanizing, nature, of, rehabilitative, practices, and, encourage, the, maintenance, of, agency, and, control, in, these, programs, to, prevent, them, from, becoming, self, serving, entities, that, cause, further, exploitation, others, argue, that, certain, education, systems, are, falsely, advertised, as, a, perfect, solution, when, in, reality, there, are, much, larger, systemic, issues, at, hand, rather, than, trying, to, shape, inmates, into, helpful, workforce, members, upon, release, scholars, like, michael, sutcliffe, argue, that, there, needs, to, be, a, focus, on, re, enfranchising, members, and, helping, them, share, their, voices, still, others, advocate, for, styles, of, collective, life, writing, to, capture, the, experience, of, incarcerated, individuals, and, fight, against, exclusionary, institutions, taking, an, alternative, approach, queer, literacy, frameworks, have, also, been, supported, by, scholars, like, alexandra, cavallaro, who, see, the, incorporation, of, lgbtq, individuals, stories, as, key, to, promoting, lifelong, learning, keeping, forward, solutions, in, mind, rhetorical, listening, is, a, final, approach, that, is, spread, by, leaders, like, wendy, hinshaw, many, prisons, provide, limited, recreational, and, fitness, facilities, for, prisoners, the, provision, of, these, services, is, controversial, with, certain, elements, of, society, claiming, that, prisons, are, being, soft, on, inmates, and, others, claiming, that, it, is, cruel, and, dehumanizing, to, confine, people, for, years, without, any, recreational, opportunities, the, tension, between, these, two, opinions, coupled, with, lack, of, funding, leads, to, a, large, variety, of, different, recreational, procedures, at, different, prisons, prison, administrators, however, generally, find, the, provision, of, recreational, opportunities, to, be, useful, at, maintaining, order, in, the, prisons, because, it, keeps, prisoners, occupied, and, provides, leverage, to, gain, compliance, by, depriving, prisoners, of, recreation, as, punishment, examples, of, common, facilities, programs, that, are, available, in, some, prisons, are, gyms, and, weightlifting, rooms, arts, and, crafts, games, such, as, cards, chess, or, bingo, television, sets, and, sports, teams, additionally, many, prisons, have, an, outdoor, recreation, area, commonly, referred, to, as, an, exercise, yard, most, prisoners, are, part, of, the, general, population, of, the, prison, members, of, which, are, generally, able, to, socialize, with, each, other, in, common, areas, of, the, prison, a, control, unit, or, segregation, unit, also, called, a, block, or, isolation, cell, is, a, highly, secure, area, of, the, prison, where, inmates, are, placed, in, solitary, confinement, to, isolate, them, from, the, general, population, other, prisoners, that, are, often, segregated, from, the, general, population, include, those, who, are, in, protective, custody, or, who, are, on, suicide, watch, and, those, whose, behavior, presents, a, threat, to, other, prisoners, in, addition, to, the, above, facilities, others, that, are, common, include, prison, factories, and, workshops, visiting, areas, mail, rooms, telephone, and, computer, rooms, a, prison, store, often, called, a, canteen, where, prisoners, can, purchase, goods, with, prison, commissary, some, prisons, have, a, death, row, where, prisoners, who, have, been, sentenced, to, death, await, execution, and, an, execution, room, where, the, death, sentence, is, carried, out, in, places, like, singapore, and, malaysia, there, is, place, for, corporal, punishment, carried, out, by, caning, prisons, for, juveniles, are, known, by, a, variety, of, names, including, youth, detention, facilities, juvenile, detention, centers, and, reformatories, the, purpose, of, youth, detention, facilities, is, to, keep, young, offenders, away, from, the, public, while, working, towards, rehabilitation, the, idea, of, separately, treating, youthful, and, adult, offenders, is, a, relatively, modern, idea, the, earliest, known, use, of, the, term, juvenile, delinquency, was, in, london, in, 1816, from, where, it, quickly, spread, to, the, united, states, the, first, juvenile, correctional, institution, in, the, united, states, opened, in, 1825, in, new, york, city, by, 1917, juvenile, courts, had, been, established, in, all, but, 3, states, it, was, estimated, that, in, 2011, more, than, 95, 000, juveniles, were, locked, up, in, prisons, and, jails, in, the, united, states, the, largest, youth, prisoner, population, in, the, world, besides, prisons, many, other, types, of, residential, placement, exist, within, juvenile, justice, systems, including, youth, homes, community, based, programs, training, schools, and, boot, camps, like, adult, facilities, youth, detention, centers, in, some, countries, are, experiencing, overcrowding, due, to, large, increases, in, incarceration, rates, of, young, offenders, crowding, can, create, extremely, dangerous, environments, in, juvenile, detention, centers, and, juvenile, correctional, facilities, overcrowding, may, also, lead, to, the, decrease, in, availability, to, provide, the, youth, with, much, needed, and, promised, programs, and, services, while, they, are, in, the, facility, many, times, the, administration, is, not, prepared, to, handle, the, large, number, of, residents, and, therefore, the, facilities, can, become, unstable, and, create, instability, in, simple, logistics, in, addition, to, overcrowding, juvenile, prisons, are, questioned, for, their, overall, effectiveness, in, rehabilitating, youth, many, critics, note, high, juvenile, recidivism, rates, and, the, fact, that, most, of, the, youths, that, are, incarcerated, are, those, from, lower, socio, economic, classes, who, often, suffer, from, broken, families, lack, of, educational, job, opportunities, and, violence, in, their, communities, in, the, 19th, century, a, growing, awareness, that, female, prisoners, had, different, needs, to, male, prisoners, led, to, the, establishment, of, dedicated, prisons, for, women, in, modern, times, it, is, the, norm, for, female, inmates, to, be, housed, in, either, a, separate, prison, or, a, separate, wing, of, a, unisex, prison, the, aim, is, to, protect, them, from, physical, and, sexual, abuse, that, would, otherwise, occur, in, the, western, world, the, guards, of, women, s, prisons, are, usually, female, though, not, always, for, example, in, federal, women, s, correction, facilities, of, the, united, states, 70, of, guards, are, male, rape, and, sexual, offenses, remain, commonplace, in, many, women, s, prisons, and, are, usually, underreported, two, studies, in, the, late, 2000s, noted, that, because, a, high, proportion, of, female, inmates, have, experienced, sexual, abuse, in, the, past, they, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, further, abuse, the, needs, of, mothers, during, pregnancy, and, childbirth, often, conflict, with, the, demands, of, the, prison, system, the, rebecca, project, a, non, profit, organization, that, campaigns, for, women, s, rights, issues, reports, that, in, 2007, the, bureau, of, justice, statistics, stated, that, on, average, 5, of, women, who, enter, into, state, prisons, are, pregnant, and, in, jails, 6, of, women, are, pregnant, the, standard, of, care, that, female, prisoners, receive, before, and, after, giving, birth, is, often, far, worse, than, the, standard, expected, by, the, general, population, and, sometimes, almost, none, is, given, in, some, countries, female, prisoners, may, be, restrained, while, giving, birth, in, many, countries, including, the, united, states, mothers, will, frequently, be, separated, from, their, baby, after, giving, birth, research, has, shown, a, significant, link, between, females, in, prison, and, brain, injury, which, supports, research, that, shows, incarcerated, females, are, overwhelmingly, victims, of, domestic, violence, mainly, male, violence, against, women, prisons, have, formed, parts, of, military, systems, since, the, french, revolution, france, set, up, its, system, in, 1796, they, were, modernized, in, 1852, and, since, their, existence, are, used, variously, to, house, prisoners, of, war, unlawful, combatants, those, whose, freedom, is, deemed, a, national, security, risk, by, military, or, civilian, authorities, and, members, of, the, military, found, guilty, of, a, serious, crime, military, prisons, in, the, united, states, have, also, been, converted, to, civilian, prisons, to, include, alcatraz, island, alcatraz, was, formerly, a, military, prison, for, soldiers, during, the, american, civil, war, in, the, american, revolution, british, prisoners, held, by, the, u, s, were, assigned, to, local, farmers, as, laborers, the, british, kept, american, sailors, in, broken, down, ship, hulls, with, high, death, rates, in, the, napoleonic, wars, the, broken, down, hulks, were, still, in, use, for, naval, prisoners, one, french, surgeon, recalled, his, captivity, in, spain, where, scurvy, diarrhea, dysentery, and, typhus, abounded, and, prisoners, died, by, the, thousands, in, the, american, civil, war, at, first, prisoners, of, war, were, released, after, they, promised, not, to, fight, again,

treatment, there, was, an, increase, in, the, use, of, forced, labor, throughout, europe, food, and, medical, treatment, were, generally, comparable, to, what, active, duty, soldiers, received, and, housing, was, much, better, than, front, line, conditions, political, prisoners, are, people, who, have, been, imprisoned, because, of, their, political, beliefs, activities, and, affiliations, there, is, much, debate, about, who, qualifies, as, a, political, prisoner, the, category, of, political, prisoner, is, often, contested, and, many, regimes, that, incarcerate, political, prisoners, often, claim, that, they, are, merely, criminals, others, who, are, sometimes, classified, as, political, prisoners, include, prisoners, who, were, politicized, in, prison, and, are, subsequently, punished, for, their, involvement, with, political, causes, many, countries, maintain, or, have, in, the, past, had, a, system, of, prisons, specifically, intended, for, political, prisoners, in, some, countries, dissidents, can, be, detained, tortured, executed, and, or, disappeared, without, trial, this, can, happen, either, legally, or, extralegally, sometimes, by, falsely, accusing, people, and, fabricating, evidence, against, them, administrative, detention, is, a, classification, of, prisons, or, detention, centers, where, people, are, held, without, trial, some, psychiatric, facilities, have, characteristics, of, prisons, particularly, when, confining, patients, who, have, committed, a, crime, and, are, considered, dangerous, in, addition, many, prisons, have, psychiatric, units, dedicated, to, housing, offenders, diagnosed, with, a, wide, variety, of, mental, disorders, the, united, states, government, refers, to, psychiatric, prisons, housing, federal, inmates, as, federal, medical, centers, fmc, some, jurisdictions, refer, to, the, prison, population, total, or, per, prison, as, the, prison, muster, in, 2021, the, world, prison, brief, reported, that, at, least, 11, 5, million, people, were, imprisoned, worldwide, in, 2021, the, united, states, of, america, had, the, world, s, largest, prison, population, with, over, 2, million, people, in, american, prisons, or,

system, since, their, development, and, prosperity, directly, depends, on, the, number, of, inmates, the, prison, industry, also, includes, private, businesses, that, benefit, from, the, exploitation, of, the, prison, labor, some, scholars, using, the, term, prison, industrial, complex, have, argued, that, the, trend, of, hiring, out, prisoners, is, a, continuation, of, the, slavery, tradition, pointing, out, that, the, thirteenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, freed, slaves, but, allowed, forced, labor, for, people, convicted, of, crimes, prisons, are, very, attractive, to, employers, because, prisoners, can, be, made, to, perform, a, great, array, of, jobs, under, conditions, that, most, free, laborers, would, not, accept, and, would, be, illegal, outside, of, prisons, sub, minimum, wage, payments, no, insurance, no, collective, bargaining, lack, of, alternative, options, etc, prison, labor, can, soon, deprive, the, free, labor, of, jobs, in, a, number, of, sectors, since, the, organized, labor, turns, out, to, be, uncompetitive, compared, to, the, prison, counterpart, prisons, can, be, difficult, places, to, live, and, work, in, even, in, developed, countries, in, the, present, day, by, their, very, definition, prisons, house, individuals, who, may, be, prone, to, violence, and, rule, breaking, it, is, also, typical, that, a, high, proportion, of, inmates, have, mental, health, concerns, a, 2014, us, report, found, that, this, included, 64, of, local, jail, inmates, 54, of, state, prisoners, and, 45, of, federal, prisoners, the, environment, may, be, worsened, by, overcrowding, poor, sanitation, and, maintenance, violence, by, prisoners, against, other, prisoners, or, staff, staff, misconduct, prison, gangs, self, harm, and, the, widespread, smuggling, of, illegal, drugs, and, other, contraband, the, social, system, within, the, prison, commonly, develops, an, inmate, code, an, informal, set, of, internal, values, and, rules, that, govern, prison, life, and, relationships, but, that, may, be, at, odds, with, the, interests, of, prison, management, or, external, society, compromising, future, rehabilitation, and, increasing, recidivism, rates, in, some, cases, disorder, can, escalate, into, a, full, scale, prison, riot, which, could, lead, to, serious, injury, or, death, en, masse, academic, research, has, found, that, poor, conditions, tend, to, increase, the, likelihood, of, violence, within, prisons, prisoners, can, face, difficulty, re, integrating, back, into, society, upon, their, release, they, often, have, difficulty, finding, work, earn, less, money, when, they, do, find, work, and, experience, a, wide, range, of, medical, and, psychological, issues, many, countries, have, a, high, recidivism, rate, according, to, the, bureau, of, justice, statistics, 67, 8, of, released, prisoners, in, the, united, states, are, rearrested, within, three, years, and, 76, 6, are, rearrested, within, five, years, if, the, prisoner, has, a, family, they, are, likely, to, suffer, socially, and, economically, from, their, absence, if, a, society, has, a, very, high, imprisonment, rate, these, effects, become, noticeable, not, just, on, family, units, but, also, on, entire, poor, communities, or, communities, of, color, the, expensive, cost, of, maintaining, a, high, imprisonment, rate, also, costs, money, that, must, come, at, the, expense, of, either, the, taxpayer, or, other, government, agencies, a, variety, of, justifications, and, explanations, are, put, forth, for, why, people, are, imprisoned, by, the, state, the, most, common, of, these, are, academic, studies, have, been, inconclusive, as, to, whether, high, imprisonment, rates, reduce, crime, rates, in, comparison, to, low, imprisonment, rates, only, a, minority, suggest, it, creates, a, significant, reduction, and, others, suggest, it, increases, crime, prisoners, are, at, risk, of, being, drawn, further, into, crime, as, they, may, become, acquainted, with, other, criminals, trained, in, further, criminal, activity, exposed, to, further, abuse, both, from, staff, and, other, prisoners, and, left, with, criminal, records, that, make, it, difficult, to, find, legal, employment, after, release, all, of, these, things, can, result, in, a, higher, likelihood, of, reoffending, upon, release, this, has, resulted, in, a, series, of, studies, that, are, skeptical, towards, the, idea, that, prison, can, rehabilitate, offenders, as, morris, and, rothman, 1995, point, out, it, s, hard, to, train, for, freedom, in, a, cage, a, few, countries, have, been, able, to, operate, prison, systems, with, a, low, recidivism, rate, including, norway, and, sweden, on, the, other, hand, in, many, countries, including, the, united, states, the, vast, majority, of, prisoners, are, rearrested, within, 3, years, of, their, release, prison, reform, organizations, such, as, the, howard, league, for, penal, reform, are, not, entirely, opposed, to, attempting, to, rehabilitate, offenders, but, instead, argue, that, most, prisoners, would, be, more, likely, to, be, rehabilitated, if, they, received,
