in, the, field, of, jurisprudence, equity, is, the, particular, body, of, law, developed, in, the, english, court, of, chancery, with, the, general, purpose, of, providing, legal, remedies, for, cases, wherein, the, common, law, is, inflexible, and, cannot, fairly, resolve, the, disputed, legal, matter, conceptually, equity, was, part, of, the, historical, origins, of, the, system, of, common, law, of, england, yet, is, a, field, of, law, separate, from, common, law, because, equity, has, its, own, unique, rules, and, principles, and, was, administered, by, courts, of, equity, equity, exists, in, domestic, law, both, in, civil, law, and, in, common, law, systems, and, in, international, law, the, tradition, of, equity, begins, in, antiquity, with, the, writings, of, aristotle, epieikeia, and, with, roman, law, aequitas, later, in, civil, law, systems, equity, was, integrated, in, the, legal, rules, while, in, common, law, systems, it, became, an, independent, body, of, law, in, jurisdictions, following, the, english, common, law, system, equity, is, the, body, of, law, which, was, developed, in, the, english, court, of, chancery, and, which, is, now, administered, concurrently, with, the, common, law, in, common, law, jurisdictions, the, word, equity, is, not, a, synonym, for, general, fairness, or, natural, justice, but, refers, to, a, particular, body, of, rules, that, originated, in, a, special, system, of, courts, for, much, of, its, history, the, english, common, law, was, principally, developed, and, administered, in, the, central, royal, courts, the, court, of, king, s, bench, the, court, of, common, pleas, and, the, exchequer, equity, was, the, name, given, to, the, law, which, was, administered, in, the, court, of, chancery, the, judicature, acts, of, the, 1870s, effected, a, procedural, fusion, of, the, two, bodies, of, law, ending, their, institutional, separation, the, reforms, did, not, fuse, the, actual, bodies, of, law, however, as, an, example, this, lack, of, fusion, meant, it, was, still, not, possible, to, receive, an, equitable, remedy, for, a, purely, common, law, wrong, judicial, or, academic, reasoning, which, assumes, the, contrary, has, been, described, as, a, fusion, fallacy, jurisdictions, which, have, inherited, the, common, law, system, differ, in, their, treatment, of, equity, over, the, course, of, the, twentieth, century, some, common, law, systems, began, to, place, less, emphasis, on, the, historical, or, institutional, origin, of, substantive, legal, rules, in, england, and, wales, australia, new, zealand, and, canada, equity, remains, a, distinct, body, of, law, modern, equity, includes, among, other, things, black, s, law, dictionary, 10th, ed, definition, 4, differentiates, common, law, or, just, law, from, equity, before, 1873, england, had, two, complementary, court, systems, courts, of, law, which, could, only, award, money, damages, and, recognized, only, the, legal, owner, of, property, and, courts, of, equity, courts, of, chancery, that, could, issue, injunctive, relief, that, is, a, court, order, to, a, party, to, do, something, give, something, to, someone, or, stop, doing, something, and, recognized, trusts, of, property, this, split, propagated, to, many, of, the, colonies, including, the, united, states, the, states, of, delaware, mississippi, south, carolina, and, tennessee, continue, to, have, divided, courts, of, law, and, courts, of, chancery, in, new, jersey, the, appellate, courts, are, unified, but, the, trial, courts, are, organized, into, a, chancery, division, and, a, law, division, there, is, a, difference, of, opinion, in, commonwealth, countries, as, to, whether, equity, and, common, law, have, been, fused, or, are, merely, administered, by, the, same, court, with, the, orthodox, view, that, they, have, not, expressed, as, rejecting, the, fusion, fallacy, prevailing, in, australia, while, support, for, fusion, has, been, expressed, by, the, new, zealand, court, of, appeal, for, most, purposes, the, u, s, federal, system, and, most, states, have, merged, the, two, courts, the, latter, part, of, the, twentieth, century, saw, increased, debate, over, the, utility, of, treating, equity, as, a, separate, body, of, law, these, debates, were, labelled, the, fusion, wars, a, particular, flashpoint, in, this, debate, centred, on, the, concept, of, unjust, enrichment, and, whether, areas, of, law, traditionally, regarded, as, equitable, could, be, rationalised, as, part, of, a, single, body, of, law, known, as, the, law, of, unjust, enrichment, after, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, the, 11th, century, royal, justice, came, to, be, administered, in, three, central, courts, the, court, of, king, s, bench, the, court, of, common, pleas, and, the, exchequer, the, common, law, developed, in, these, royal, courts, which, were, created, by, the, authority, of, the, king, of, england, and, whose, jurisdiction, over, disputes, between, the, king, s, subjects, was, based, upon, the, king, s, writ, initially, a, writ, was, probably, a, vague, order, to, do, right, by, the, plaintiff, and, it, was, usually, a, writ, of, grace, issued, at, the, pleasure, of, the, king, during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, writ, procedure, gradually, evolved, into, something, much, more, rigid, all, writs, to, commence, actions, had, to, be, purchased, by, litigants, from, the, chancery, the, head, of, which, was, the, lord, chancellor, after, writs, began, to, become, more, specific, and, creative, in, terms, of, the, relief, sought, parliament, responded, in, 1258, by, providing, in, the, provisions, of, oxford, that, the, chancellor, could, no, longer, create, new, writs, without, permission, from, the, king, and, the, king, s, council, the, curia, regis, pursuant, to, this, authorization, litigants, could, purchase, certain, enumerated, writs, de, cursu, as, a, matter, of, course, which, later, became, known, as, writs, ex, debito, justitiae, as, a, matter, of, right, each, of, these, writs, was, associated, with, particular, circumstances, and, led, to, a, particular, kind, of, judgment, procedure, in, the, common, law, courts, became, tightly, focused, on, the, form, of, action, the, particular, procedure, authorized, by, a, particular, writ, to, enforce, a, particular, substantive, right, rather, than, what, modern, lawyers, would, now, call, the, cause, of, action, the, underlying, substantive, right, to, be, enforced, because, the, writ, system, was, limited, to, enumerated, writs, for, enumerated, rights, and, wrongs, it, sometimes, produced, unjust, results, thus, even, though, the, king, s, bench, might, have, jurisdiction, over, a, case, and, might, have, the, power, to, issue, the, perfect, writ, the, plaintiff, might, still, not, have, a, case, if, there, was, not, a, single, form, of, action, combining, them, lacking, a, legal, remedy, the, plaintiff, s, only, option, would, be, to, petition, the, king, litigants, began, to, seek, relief, against, unfair, judgments, of, the, common, law, courts, by, petitioning, the, king, such, petitions, were, initially, processed, by, the, king, s, council, which, itself, was, quite, overworked, and, the, council, began, to, delegate, the, hearing, of, such, petitions, to, the, lord, chancellor, this, delegation, is, often, justified, by, the, fact, that, the, lord, chancellor, was, literally, the, keeper, of, the, king, s, conscience, although, francis, palgrave, argued, that, the, delegation, was, initially, driven, by, practical, concerns, and, the, moral, justification, came, later, the, moral, justification, went, as, follows, as, keeper, of, the, king, s, conscience, the, chancellor, would, act, in, particular, cases, to, admit, merciful, exceptions, to, the, king, s, general, laws, to, ensure, that, the, king, s, conscience, was, right, before, god, this, concern, for, the, king, s, conscience, was, then, extended, to, the, conscience, of, the, defendant, in, chancery, in, that, the, chancellor, would, intervene, to, prevent, unconscionable, conduct, on, the, part, of, the, defendant, in, order, to, protect, the, conscience, of, the, king, by, the, 14th, century, it, appears, that, chancery, was, operating, as, a, court, affording, remedies, for, which, the, strict, procedures, of, the, common, law, worked, injustice, or, provided, no, remedy, to, a, deserving, plaintiff, chancellors, often, had, theological, and, clerical, training, and, were, well, versed, in, roman, law, and, canon, law, during, this, era, the, roman, concept, of, aequitas, influenced, the, development, of, the, distinctly, different, but, related, english, concept, of, equity, the, equity, administered, by, the, early, english, chancellors, confessedly, borrowed, from, the, aequitas, and, the, judicial, powers, of, the, roman, magistrates, by, the, 15th, century, the, judicial, power, of, chancery, was, clearly, recognised, early, chancery, pleadings, vaguely, invoked, some, sort, of, higher, justice, such, as, with, the, formula, for, the, love, of, god, and, in, way, of, charity, during, the, 15th, century, chancery, pleadings, began, to, expressly, invoke, conscience, to, the, point, that, english, lawyers, in, the, late, 15th, century, thought, of, chancery, as, a, court, of, conscience, not, a, court, of, equity, however, the, reasoning, of, the, medieval, chancellors, has, not, been, preserved, as, to, what, they, actually, meant, by, the, word, conscience, and, modern, scholars, can, only, indirectly, guess, at, what, the, word, probably, meant, the, publication, of, the, treatise, the, doctor, and, student, in, the, early, 16th, century, marked, the, beginning, of, chancery, s, transformation, from, a, court, of, conscience, to, a, court, of, equity, before, that, point, in, time, the, word, equity, was, used, in, the, common, law, to, refer, to, a, principle, of, statutory, interpretation, derived, from, aequitas, the, idea, that, written, laws, ought, to, be, interpreted, according, to, the, intention, rather, than, the, letter, of, the, law, what, was, new, was, the, application, of, the, word, equity, to, the, extraordinary, form, of, justice, administered, by, the, chancellor, as, a, convenient, way, to, distinguish, chancery, jurisprudence, from, the, common, law, a, common, criticism, of, chancery, practice, as, it, developed, in, the, early, medieval, period, was, that, it, lacked, fixed, rules, varied, greatly, from, chancellor, to, chancellor, and, the, chancellor, was, exercising, an, unbounded, discretion, the, counterargument, was, that, equity, mitigated, the, rigour, of, the, common, law, by, looking, to, substance, rather, than, to, form, the, early, chancellors, were, influenced, by, their, training, in, theology, and, canon, law, but, the, law, of, equity, they, applied, was, not, canon, law, but, a, new, kind, of, law, purportedly, driven, by, conscience, whatever, it, meant, in, the, medieval, era, the, word, conscience, clearly, carried, a, subjective, connotation, as, it, still, does, today, complaints, about, equity, as, an, arbitrary, exercise, of, conscience, by, nonlawyer, chancellors, became, quite, frequent, under, the, chancellorship, of, thomas, wolsey, 1515, 1529, who, had, no, legal, training, and, delighted, in, putting, down, lawyers, in, 1546, chancellor, thomas, wriothesley, a, nonlawyer, was, accused, of, trying, to, inject, the, civil, law, into, chancery, this, was, a, wild, exaggeration, but, as, a, result, the, crown, began, to, transition, away, from, clergy, and, nonlawyers, and, instead, appointed, only, lawyers, trained, in, the, common, law, tradition, to, the, position, of, lord, chancellor, although, there, were, six, more, nonlawyer, chancellors, in, the, decades, after, wriothesley, the, last, person, without, training, in, the, common, law, before, 2016, to, serve, as, lord, chancellor, was, anthony, ashley, cooper, 1st, earl, of, shaftesbury, who, served, briefly, from, 1672, to, 1673, liz, truss, was, appointed, as, lord, chancellor, in, 2016, but, this, was, after, the, position, had, been, stripped, of, its, judicial, powers, by, the, constitutional, reform, act, 2005, leaving, the, chancellor, of, the, high, court, as, the, highest, judge, sitting, in, equity, in, england, and, wales, the, development, of, a, court, of, equity, as, a, remedy, for, the, rigid, procedure, of, the, common, law, courts, meant, it, was, inevitable, that, the, two, systems, would, come, into, conflict, litigants, would, go, jurisdiction, shopping, and, often, would, seek, an, equitable, injunction, prohibiting, the, enforcement, of, a, common, law, court, order, the, penalty, for, disobeying, an, equitable, injunction, and, enforcing, an, unconscionable, common, law, judgment, was, imprisonment, the, 1615, conflict, between, common, law, and, equity, came, about, because, of, a, clash, of, strong, personalities, between, lord, chancellor, ellesmere, and, the, chief, justice, of, the, king, s, bench, sir, edward, coke, chief, justice, coke, began, the, practice, of, issuing, writs, of, habeas, corpus, that, required, the, release, of, people, imprisoned, for, contempt, of, chancery, orders, this, tension, reached, a, climax, in, the, earl, of, oxford, s, case, 1615, where, a, judgment, of, chief, justice, coke, was, allegedly, obtained, by, fraud, chancellor, ellesmere, issued, an, injunction, from, the, chancery, prohibiting, the, enforcement, of, the, common, law, order, the, two, courts, became, locked, in, a, stalemate, and, the, matter, was, eventually, referred, to, the, attorney, general, sir, francis, bacon, sir, francis, by, authority, of, king, james, i, upheld, the, use, of, the, equitable, injunction, and, concluded, that, in, the, event, of, any, conflict, between, the, common, law, and, equity, equity, would, prevail, chancery, continued, to, be, the, subject, of, extensive, criticism, the, most, famous, of, which, was, 17th, century, jurist, john, selden, s, aphorism, equity, is, a, roguish, thing, for, law, we, have, a, measure, know, what, to, trust, to, equity, is, according, to, the, conscience, of, him, that, is, chancellor, and, as, that, is, larger, or, narrower, so, is, equity, tis, all, one, as, if, they, should, make, the, standard, for, the, measure, we, call, a, foot, a, chancellor, s, foot, what, an, uncertain, measure, would, this, be, one, chancellor, has, a, long, foot, another, a, short, foot, a, third, an, indifferent, foot, tis, the, same, thing, in, a, chancellor, s, conscience, after, 1660, chancery, cases, were, regularly, reported, several, equitable, doctrines, developed, and, equity, started, to, evolve, into, a, system, of, precedents, like, its, common, law, cousin, over, time, equity, jurisprudence, would, gradually, become, a, body, of, equitable, law, as, complex, doctrinal, and, rule, haunted, as, the, common, law, ever, was, one, indicator, of, equity, s, evolution, into, a, coherent, body, of, law, was, lord, eldon, s, response, to, selden, in, an, 1818, chancery, case, i, cannot, agree, that, the, doctrines, of, this, court, are, to, be, changed, with, every, succeeding, judge, nothing, would, inflict, on, me, greater, pain, in, quitting, this, place, than, the, recollection, that, i, had, done, anything, to, justify, the, reproach, that, the, equity, of, this, court, varies, like, the, chancellor, s, foot, equity, s, primacy, over, common, law, in, england, was, later, enshrined, in, the, judicature, acts, of, the, 1870s, which, also, served, to, fuse, the, courts, of, equity, and, the, common, law, although, emphatically, not, the, systems, themselves, into, one, unified, court, system, one, area, in, which, the, court, of, chancery, assumed, a, vital, role, was, the, enforcement, of, uses, a, role, that, the, rigid, framework, of, land, law, could, not, accommodate, this, role, gave, rise, to, the, basic, distinction, between, legal, and, equitable, interests, in, order, to, avoid, paying, land, taxes, and, other, feudal, dues, lawyers, developed, a, primitive, form, of, trust, called, the, use, that, enabled, one, person, who, was, not, required, to, pay, tax, to, hold, the, legal, title, of, the, land, for, the, use, of, another, person, the, effect, of, this, trust, was, that, the, first, person, owned, the, land, under, the, common, law, but, the, second, person, had, a, right, to, use, the, land, under, the, law, of, equity, henry, viii, enacted, the, statute, of, uses, in, 1535, which, became, effective, in, 1536, in, an, attempt, to, outlaw, this, practice, and, recover, lost, revenue, the, act, effectively, made, the, beneficial, owner, of, the, land, the, legal, owner, and, therefore, liable, for, feudal, dues, the, response, of, the, lawyers, to, this, statute, was, to, create, the, use, upon, a, use, the, statute, recognized, only, the, first, use, and, so, land, owners, were, again, able, to, separate, the, legal, and, beneficial, interests, in, their, land, equity, remains, a, cornerstone, of, australian, private, law, a, string, of, cases, in, the, 1980s, saw, the, high, court, of, australia, re, affirm, the, continuing, vitality, of, traditional, equitable, doctrines, in, 2009, the, high, court, affirmed, the, importance, of, equity, and, dismissed, the, suggestion, that, unjust, enrichment, has, explanatory, power, in, relation, to, traditional, equitable, doctrines, such, as, subrogation, the, state, of, new, south, wales, is, particularly, well, known, for, the, strength, of, its, equity, jurisprudence, however, it, was, only, in, 1972, with, the, introduction, of, reform, to, the, supreme, court, act, 1970, nsw, that, empowered, both, the, equity, and, common, law, division, of, the, supreme, court, of, nsw, to, grant, relief, in, either, equity, or, common, law, in, 1972, nsw, also, adopted, one, of, the, essential, sections, of, the, judicature, reforms, which, emphasised, that, where, there, was, a, conflict, between, the, common, law, and, equity, equity, would, always, prevail, nevertheless, in, 1975, three, alumni, of, sydney, law, school, and, judges, of, the, nsw, supreme, court, roddy, meagher, william, gummow, and, john, lehane, produced, equity, doctrines, remedies, it, remains, one, of, the, most, highly, regarded, practitioner, texts, in, australia, and, england, the, work, is, now, in, its, 5th, edition, and, edited, by, dyson, heydon, former, justice, of, the, high, court, justice, mark, leeming, of, the, new, south, wales, court, of, appeal, and, dr, peter, turner, of, cambridge, university, equity, remains, a, distinct, part, of, the, law, of, england, and, wales, the, main, challenge, to, it, has, come, from, academic, writers, working, within, the, law, of, unjust, enrichment, scholars, such, as, peter, birks, and, andrew, burrows, argue, that, in, many, cases, the, inclusion, of, the, label, legal, or, equitable, before, a, substantive, rule, is, often, unnecessary, many, english, universities, such, as, oxford, and, cambridge, continue, to, teach, equity, as, a, standalone, subject, leading, practitioner, texts, include, snell, s, equity, lewin, on, trusts, and, hayton, underhill, s, law, of, trusts, and, trustees, limits, on, the, power, of, equity, in, english, law, were, clarified, by, the, house, of, lords, in, the, scaptrade, case, scandinavian, trading, tanker, co, a, b, v, flota, petrolera, ecuatoriana, 2, ac, 694, 700, where, the, notion, that, the, court, s, jurisdiction, to, grant, relief, was, unlimited, and, unfettered, per, lord, simon, of, glaisdale, in, shiloh, spinners, ltd, v, harding, a, c, 691, 726, was, rejected, as, a, beguiling, heresy, the, courts, of, scotland, have, never, recognised, a, division, between, the, normal, common, law, and, equity, and, as, such, the, court, of, session, the, supreme, civil, court, of, scotland, has, exercised, an, equitable, and, inherent, jurisdiction, and, called, the, nobile, officium, the, nobile, officium, enables, the, court, to, provide, a, legal, remedy, where, statute, or, the, common, law, are, silent, and, prevent, mistakes, in, procedure, or, practice, that, would, lead, to, injustice, the, exercise, of, this, power, is, limited, by, adherence, to, precedent, and, when, legislation, or, the, common, law, already, specify, the, relevant, remedy, thus, the, court, cannot, set, aside, a, statutory, power, but, can, deal, with, situations, where, the, law, is, silent, or, where, there, is, an, omission, in, statute, such, an, omission, is, sometimes, termed, a, casus, improvisus, in, india, the, common, law, doctrine, of, equity, had, traditionally, been, followed, even, after, it, became, independent, in, 1947, however, in, 1963, the, specific, relief, act, was, passed, by, the, parliament, of, india, following, the, recommendation, of, the, law, commission, of, india, and, repealing, the, earlier, specific, relief, act, of, 1877, under, the, 1963, act, most, equitable, concepts, were, codified, and, made, statutory, rights, thereby, ending, the, discretionary, role, of, the, courts, to, grant, equitable, reliefs, the, rights, codified, under, the, 1963, act, were, as, under, with, this, codification, the, nature, and, tenure, of, the, equitable, reliefs, available, earlier, have, been, modified, to, make, them, statutory, rights, and, are, also, required, to, be, pleaded, specifically, to, be, enforced, further, to, the, extent, that, these, equitable, reliefs, have, been, codified, into, rights, they, are, no, longer, discretionary, upon, the, courts, or, as, the, english, law, has, it, chancellor, s, foot, but, instead, are, enforceable, rights, subject, to, the, conditions, under, the, 1963, act, being, satisfied, nonetheless, in, the, event, of, situations, not, covered, under, the, 1963, act, the, courts, in, india, continue, to, exercise, their, inherent, powers, in, terms, of, section, 151, of, the, code, of, civil, procedure, 1908, which, applies, to, all, civil, courts, in, india, there, is, no, such, inherent, powers, with, the, criminal, courts, in, india, except, with, the, high, courts, in, terms, of, section, 482, of, the, code, of, criminal, procedure, 1973, further, such, inherent, powers, are, vested, in, the, supreme, court, of, india, in, terms, of, article, 142, of, the, constitution, of, india, which, confers, wide, powers, on, the, supreme, court, to, pass, orders, as, is, necessary, for, doing, complete, justice, in, any, cause, of, matter, pending, before, it, in, modern, practice, perhaps, the, most, important, distinction, between, law, and, equity, is, the, set, of, remedies, each, offers, the, most, common, civil, remedy, a, court, of, law, can, award, is, monetary, damages, equity, however, enters, injunctions, or, decrees, directing, someone, either, to, act, or, to, forbear, from, acting, often, this, form, of, relief, is, in, practical, terms, more, valuable, to, a, litigant, for, example, a, plaintiff, whose, neighbor, will, not, return, his, only, milk, cow, which, had, wandered, onto, the, neighbor, s, property, may, want, that, particular, cow, back, not, just, its, monetary, value, however, in, general, a, litigant, cannot, obtain, equitable, relief, unless, there, is, no, adequate, remedy, at, law, that, is, a, court, will, not, grant, an, injunction, unless, monetary, damages, are, an, insufficient, remedy, for, the, injury, in, question, law, courts, can, also, enter, certain, types, of, immediately, enforceable, orders, called, writs, such, as, a, writ, of, habeas, corpus, but, they, are, less, flexible, and, less, easily, obtained, than, an, injunction, another, distinction, is, the, unavailability, of, a, jury, in, equity, the, judge, is, the, trier, of, fact, in, the, american, legal, system, the, right, of, jury, trial, in, civil, cases, tried, in, federal, court, is, guaranteed, by, the, seventh, amendment, in, suits, at, common, law, cases, that, traditionally, would, have, been, handled, by, the, law, courts, the, question, of, whether, a, case, should, be, determined, by, a, jury, depends, largely, on, the, type, of, relief, the, plaintiff, requests, if, a, plaintiff, requests, damages, in, the, form, of, money, or, certain, other, forms, of, relief, such, as, the, return, of, a, specific, item, of, property, the, remedy, is, considered, legal, and, a, jury, is, available, as, the, fact, finder, on, the, other, hand, if, the, plaintiff, requests, an, injunction, declaratory, judgment, specific, performance, modification, of, contract, or, some, other, non, monetary, relief, the, claim, would, usually, be, one, in, equity, thomas, jefferson, explained, in, 1785, that, there, are, three, main, limitations, on, the, power, of, a, court, of, equity, if, the, legislature, means, to, enact, an, injustice, however, palpable, the, court, of, chancery, is, not, the, body, with, whom, a, correcting, power, is, lodged, that, it, shall, not, interpose, in, any, case, which, does, not, come, within, a, general, description, and, admit, of, redress, by, a, general, and, practicable, rule, the, us, supreme, court, however, has, concluded, that, courts, have, wide, discretion, to, fashion, relief, in, cases, of, equity, the, first, major, statement, of, this, power, came, in, willard, v, tayloe, 75, u, s, 557, 1869, the, court, concluded, that, relief, is, not, a, matter, of, absolute, right, to, either, party, it, is, a, matter, resting, in, the, discretion, of, the, court, to, be, exercised, upon, a, consideration, of, all, the, circumstances, of, each, particular, case, willard, v, tayloe, was, for, many, years, the, leading, case, in, contract, law, regarding, intent, and, enforcement, as, well, as, equity, in, the, united, states, the, federal, courts, and, most, state, courts, have, merged, law, and, equity, into, courts, of, general, jurisdiction, such, as, county, courts, however, the, substantive, distinction, between, law, and, equity, has, retained, its, old, vitality, this, difference, is, not, a, mere, technicality, because, the, successful, handling, of, certain, law, cases, is, difficult, or, impossible, unless, a, temporary, restraining, order, tro, or, preliminary, injunction, is, issued, at, the, outset, to, restrain, someone, from, fleeing, the, jurisdiction, taking, the, only, property, available, to, satisfy, a, judgment, for, instance, furthermore, certain, statutes, like, the, employee, retirement, income, security, act, specifically, authorize, only, equitable, relief, which, forces, american, courts, to, analyze, in, lengthy, detail, whether, the, relief, demanded, in, particular, cases, brought, under, those, statutes, would, have, been, available, in, equity, equity, courts, were, widely, distrusted, in, the, northeastern, united, states, following, the, american, revolution, a, serious, movement, for, merger, of, law, and, equity, began, in, the, states, in, the, mid, 19th, century, when, david, dudley, field, ii, convinced, new, york, state, to, adopt, what, became, known, as, the, field, code, of, 1848, the, federal, courts, did, not, abandon, the, old, law, equity, separation, until, the, promulgation, of, the, federal, rules, of, civil, procedure, in, 1938, three, states, still, have, separate, courts, for, law, and, equity, delaware, whose, court, of, chancery, is, where, most, cases, involving, delaware, corporations, which, includes, a, disproportionate, number, of, multi, state, corporations, are, decided, mississippi, and, tennessee, however, merger, in, some, states, is, less, than, complete, some, other, states, such, as, illinois, and, new, jersey, have, separate, divisions, for, legal, and, equitable, matters, in, a, single, court, virginia, had, separate, law, and, equity, dockets, in, the, same, court, until, 2006, besides, corporate, law, which, developed, out, of, the, law, of, trusts, areas, traditionally, handled, by, chancery, courts, included, wills, and, probate, adoptions, and, guardianships, and, marriage, and, divorce, bankruptcy, was, also, historically, considered, an, equitable, matter, although, bankruptcy, in, the, united, states, is, today, a, purely, federal, matter, reserved, entirely, to, the, united, states, bankruptcy, courts, by, the, enactment, of, the, united, states, bankruptcy, code, in, 1978, bankruptcy, courts, are, still, officially, considered, courts, of, equity, and, exercise, equitable, powers, under, section, 105, of, the, bankruptcy, code, after, us, courts, merged, law, and, equity, american, law, courts, adopted, many, of, the, procedures, of, equity, courts, the, procedures, in, a, court, of, equity, were, much, more, flexible, than, the, courts, at, common, law, in, american, practice, certain, devices, such, as, joinder, counterclaim, cross, claim, and, interpleader, originated, in, the, courts, of, equity, for, a, history, of, equity, in, england, including, the, statute, of, uses, 1535, for, a, general, treatise, on, equity, including, a, historical, analysis, for, a, brief, outline, of, the, maxims, doctrines, and, remedies, developed, under, equity
