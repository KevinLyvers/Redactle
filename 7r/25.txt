think, of, in, terms, of, rules, laws, on, debt, legal, contracts, and, law, codes, relating, to, business, practices, and, private, property, the, babylonians, and, their, city, state, neighbors, developed, forms, of, economics, comparable, to, currently, used, civil, society, law, concepts, they, developed, the, first, known, codified, legal, and, administrative, systems, complete, with, courts, jails, and, government, records, the, ancient, economy, was, based, primarily, on, subsistence, farming, the, shekel, are, the, first, to, refer, to, a, unit, of, weight, and, currency, used,

in, the, new, world, the, discoveries, of, marco, polo, 1254, 1324, christopher, columbus, 1451, 1506, and, vasco, da, gama, 1469, 1524, led, to, a, first, global, economy, the, first, enterprises,

by, the, ideas, of, physiocracy, a, reaction, to, mercantilism, and, also, later, economics, student, adam, mari, he, defined, the, elements, of, a, national, economy, products, are, offered, at, a, natural, price, generated, by, the, use, of, competition, supply, and, demand, and, the, division, of, labor, he, maintained, that, the, basic, motive, for, free, trade, is, human, self, interest, the, so, called, self, interest, hypothesis, became, the, anthropological, basis, for, economics, thomas, malthus, 1766, 1834, transferred, the, idea, of, supply, and, demand, to, the, problem, of, overpopulation, the, industrial, revolution, was, a, period, from, the, 18th, to, the, 19th, century, where, major, changes, in, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and, transport, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, socioeconomic, and, cultural, conditions, starting, in, the, united, kingdom, then, subsequently, spreading, throughout, europe, north, america, and, eventually, the, world, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, marked, a, major, turning, point, in, human, history, almost, every, aspect, of, daily, life, was, eventually, influenced, in, some, way, in, europe, wild, capitalism, started, to, replace, the, system, of, mercantilism, today, protectionism, and, led, to, economic, growth, the, period, is, called, the, industrial, revolution, because, the, system, of, production, and, division, of, labor, enabled, the, mass, production, of, goods, the, contemporary, concept, of, the, economy, wasn, t, popularly, known, until, the, american, great, depression, in, the, 1930s, after, the, chaos, of, two, world, wars, and, the, devastating, great, depression, policymakers, searched, for, new, ways, of, controlling, the, course, of, the, economy, this, was, explored, and, discussed, by, friedrich, august, von, hayek, 1899, 1992, and, milton, friedman, 1912, 2006, who, pleaded, for, a, global, free, trade, and, are, supposed, to, be, the, fathers, of, the, so, called, neoliberalism, however, the, prevailing, view, was, that, held, by, john, maynard, keynes, 1883, 1946, who, argued, for, a, stronger, control, of, the, markets, by, the, state, the, theory, that, the, state, can, alleviate, economic, problems, and, instigate, economic, growth, through, state, manipulation, of, aggregate, demand, is, called, keynesianism, in, his, honor, in, the, late, 1950s, the, economic, growth, in, america, and, europe, often, called, wirtschaftswunder, german, for, economic, miracle, brought, up, a, new, form, of, economy, mass, consumption, economy, in, 1958, john, kenneth, galbraith, 1908, 2006, was, the, first, to, speak, of, an, affluent, society, in, his, book, the, affluent, society, in, most, of, the, countries, the, economic, system, is, called, a, social, market, economy, with, the, fall, of, the, iron, curtain, and, the, transition, of, the, countries, of, the, eastern, bloc, towards, democratic, government, and, market, economies, the, idea, of, the, post, industrial, society, is, brought, into, importance, as, its, role, is, to, mark, together, the, significance, that, the, service, sector, receives, instead, of, industrialization, some, attribute, the, first, use, of, this, term, to, daniel, bell, s, 1973, book, the, coming, of, post, industrial, society, while, others, attribute, it, to, social, philosopher, ivan, illich, s, book, tools, for, conviviality, the, term, is, also, applied, in, philosophy, to, designate, the, fading, of, postmodernism, in, the, late, 90s, and, especially, in, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, with, the, spread, of, internet, as, a, mass, media, and, communication, medium, especially, after, 2000, 2001, the, idea, for, the, internet, and, information, economy, is, given, place, because, of, the, growing, importance, of, e, commerce, and, electronic, businesses, also, the, term, for, a, global, information, society, as, understanding, of, a, new, type, of, all,

demand, and, supply, between, participants, economic, agents, by, barter, or, a, medium, of, exchange, with, a, credit, or, debit, value, accepted, within, the, network, such, as, a, unit, of, currency, a, planned, economy, is, one, where, political, agents, directly, control, what, is, produced, and, how, it, is, sold, and, distributed, a, green, economy, is, low, carbon, and, resource, efficient, in, a, green, economy, growth, in, income, and, employment, is, driven, by, public, and, private, investments, that, reduce, carbon, emissions, and, pollution, enhance, energy, and, resource, efficiency, and, prevent, the, loss, of, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, a, gig, economy, is, one, in, which, short, term, jobs, are, assigned, or, chosen, on, demand, the, global, economy, refers, to, humanity, s, economic, system, or, systems, overall, an, informal, economy, is, neither, taxed, nor, monitored, by, any, form, of, government, the, economy, may, be, considered, as, having, developed, through, the, following, phases, or, degrees, of, precedence, in, modern, economies, these, phase, precedences, are, somewhat, differently, expressed, by, the, three, sector, model, other, sectors, of, the, developed, community, include, the, gross, domestic, product, gdp, of, a, country, is, a, measure, of, the, size, of, its, economy, or, more, specifically, monetary, measure, of, the, market, value, of, all, the, final, goods, and, services, produced, the, most, conventional, economic, analysis, of, a, country, relies, heavily, on, economic, indicators, like, the, gdp, and, gdp, per, capita, while, often, useful, gdp, only, includes, economic, activity, for, which, money, is, exchanged, due, to, the, growing, importance, of, the, financial, sector, in, modern, times, the, term, real, economy, is, used, by, analysts, as, well, as, politicians, to, denote, the, part, of, the, economy, that, is, concerned, with, the, actual, production, of, goods, and, services, as, ostensibly, contrasted, with, the, paper, economy, or, the, financial, side, of, the, economy, which, is, concerned, with, buying, and, selling, on, the, financial, markets, alternate, and, long, standing, terminology, distinguishes, measures, of, an, economy, expressed, in, real, values, adjusted, for, inflation, such, as, real, gdp, or, in, nominal, values, unadjusted, for, inflation, the, study, of, economics, are, roughly, divided, into, macroeconomics, and, microeconomics, today, the, range, of, fields, of, study, examining, the, economy, revolves, around, the, social, science, of, economics, but, may, also, include, sociology, history, anthropology, and, geography, practical, fields, directly, related, to, the, human, activities, involving, production, distribution, exchange, and, consumption, of, goods, and, services, as, a, whole, are, business, engineering, government, and, health, care, macroeconomics, is, studied, at, the, regional, and,
