was, held, in, r, v, dawson, and, james, 1978, that, force, is, an, ordinary, english, word, and, its, meaning, should, be, left, to, the, jury, this, approach, was, confirmed, in, r, v, clouden,

recording, also, not, every, single, crime, is, reported, meaning, two, things, 1, robbery, rates, are, going, to, appear, lower, than, they, actually, are, and, 2, the, percentage, of, crime, that, is, not, reported, is, going, to, be, higher, in, some, countries, then, others, for, example, in, one, country, 86, of, the, robberies, were, reported, whereas, in, another, country, only, 67, of, the, robberies, were, reported, the, last, thing, to, note, is, that, crime, will, vary, by, certain, neighborhoods, or, areas, in, each, country, so, just, because, a, nationwide, rate, is, a, specified, rate, does, not, mean, that, everywhere, in, that, country, retains, the, same, amount, of, danger, or, safety, a, 1983, study, by, the, department, of, justice, estimated, that, the,
