regime, survival, the, politics, of, arab, nationalism, and, a, shared, identity, led, arab, states, to, embrace, the, rhetoric, of, arab, unity, in, order, to, legitimize, their, regimes, and, to, fear, arab, unity, in, practice, because, it, would, impose, greater, restrictions, on, their, sovereignty, the, arab, league, was, specifically, designed, to, fail, at, producing, the, kind, of, greater, collaboration, and, integration, that, might, have, weakened, political, leaders, at, home, the, arab, league, member, states, cover, over, 13, 000, 000, km, 2, 5, 000, 000, sq, mi, and,

the, arab, league, is, a, political, organization, which, tries, to, help, integrate, its, members, economically, and, solve, conflicts, involving, member, states, without, asking, for, foreign, assistance, it, possesses, elements, of, a, state, representative, parliament, while, foreign, affairs, are, often, conducted, under, un, supervision, the, charter, of, the, arab, league, endorsed, the, principle, of, an, arab, nation, state, while, respecting, the, sovereignty, of, the, individual, member, states, the, internal, regulations, of, the, council, of, the, league, and, the, committees, were, agreed, in, october, 1951, those, of, the, secretariat, general, were, agreed, in, may, 1953, since, then, governance, of, the, arab, league, has, been, based, on, the, duality, of, supra, national, institutions, and, the, sovereignty, of, the, member, states, preservation, of, individual, statehood, derived, its, strengths, from, the, natural, preference, of, ruling, elites, to, maintain, their, power, and, independence, in, decision, making, moreover, the, fear, of, the, richer, that, the, poorer, may, share, their, wealth, in, the, name, of, arab, nationalism, the, feuds, among, arab, rulers, and, the, influence, of, external, powers, that, might, oppose, arab, unity, can, be, seen, as, obstacles, towards, a, deeper, integration, of, the, league, mindful, of, their, previous, announcements, in, support, of, the, arabs, of, palestine, the, framers, of, the, pact, were, determined, to, include, them, within, the, league, from, its, inauguration, this, was, done, by, means, of, an, annex, that, declared, even, though, palestine, was, not, able, to, control, her, own, destiny, it, was, on, the, basis, of, the, recognition, of, her, independence, that, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, determined, a, system, of, government, for, her, her, existence, and, her, independence, among, the, nations, can, therefore, no, more, be, questioned, de, jure, than, the, independence, of, any, of, the, other, arab, states, therefore, the, states, signatory, to, the, pact, of, the, arab, league, consider, that, in, view, of, palestine, s, special, circumstances, the, council, of, the, league, should, designate, an, arab, delegate, from, palestine, to, participate, in, its, work, until, this, country, enjoys, actual, independence, at, the,
