list, of, forms, of, government, a, republic, based, on, the, latin, phrase, res, publica, public, affair, is, a, state, in, which, political, power, rests, with, the, public, through, their, representatives, in, contrast, to, a, monarchy, representation, in, a, republic, may, or, may, not, be, freely, elected, by, the, general, citizenry, in, many, historical, republics, representation, has, been, based, on, personal, status, and, the, role, of, elections, has, been, limited, this, remains, true, today, among, the, 159, states, that, use, the, word, republic, in, their, official, names, as, of, 2017, and, other, states, formally, constituted, as, republics, are, states, that, narrowly, constrain, both, the, right, of, representation, and, the, process, of, election, the, term, developed, its, modern, meaning, in, reference, to, the, constitution, of, the, ancient, roman, republic, lasting, from, the, overthrow, of, the, kings, in, 509, bc, to, the, establishment, of, the, empire, in, 27, bc, this, constitution, was, characterized, by, a, senate, composed, of, wealthy, aristocrats, wielding, significant, influence, several, popular, assemblies, of, all, free, citizens, possessing, the, power, to, elect, magistrates, from, the, populace, and, pass, laws, and, a, series, of, magistracies, with, varying, types, of, civil, and, political, authority, most, often, a, republic, is, a, single, sovereign, state, but, there, are, also, subnational, state, entities, that, are, referred, to, as, republics, or, that, have, governments, that, are, described, as, republican, in, nature, the, term, originates, from, the, latin, translation, of, greek, word, politeia, cicero, among, other, latin, writers, translated, politeia, into, latin, as, res, publica, and, it, was, in, turn, translated, by, renaissance, scholars, as, republic, or, similar, terms, in, various, european, languages, the, term, can, literally, be, translated, as, public, matter, it, was, used, by, roman, writers, to, refer, to, the, state, and, government, even, during, the, period, of, the, roman, empire, the, term, politeia, can, be, translated, as, form, of, government, polity, or, regime, and, it, does, not, necessarily, imply, any, specific, type, of, regime, as, the, modern, word, republic, sometimes, does, one, of, plato, s, major, works, on, political, philosophy, usually, known, in, english, as, the, republic, was, titled, politeia, however, apart, from, the, title, modern, translations, are, generally, used, aristotle, was, apparently, the, first, classical, writer, to, state, that, the, term, politeia, can, be, used, to, refer, more, specifically, to, one, type, of, politeia, asserting, in, book, iii, of, his, politics, when, the, citizens, at, large, govern, for, the, public, good, it, is, called, by, the, name, common, to, all, governments, to, koinon, onoma, pas, n, t, n, politei, n, government, politeia, in, later, latin, works, the, term, republic, can, also, be, used, in, a, general, way, to, refer, to, any, regime, or, to, refer, specifically, to, governments, which, work, for, the, public, good, in, medieval, northern, italy, a, number, of, city, states, had, commune, or, signoria, based, governments, in, the, late, middle, ages, writers, such, as, giovanni, villani, described, these, states, using, terms, such, as, libertas, populi, a, free, people, the, terminology, changed, in, the, 15th, century, as, the, renewed, interest, in, the, writings, of, ancient, rome, caused, writers, to, prefer, classical, terminology, to, describe, non, monarchical, states, writers, most, importantly, leonardo, bruni, adopted, the, latin, phrase, res, publica, while, bruni, and, machiavelli, used, the, term, to, describe, the, states, of, northern, italy, which, were, not, monarchies, the, term, res, publica, has, a, set, of, interrelated, meanings, in, the, original, latin, in, subsequent, centuries, the, english, word, commonwealth, came, to, be, used, as, a, translation, of, res, publica, and, its, use, in, english, was, comparable, to, how, the, romans, used, the, term, res, publica, notably, during, the, protectorate, of, oliver, cromwell, the, word, commonwealth, was, the, most, common, term, to, call, the, new, monarchless, state, but, the, word, republic, was, also, in, common, use, at, the, present, time, the, term, republic, commonly, means, a, system, of, government, which, derives, its, power, from, the, people, rather, than, from, another, basis, such, as, heredity, or, divine, right, while, the, philosophical, terminology, developed, in, classical, greece, and, rome, as, already, noted, by, aristotle, there, was, already, a, long, history, of, city, states, with, a, wide, variety, of, constitutions, not, only, in, greece, but, also, in, the, middle, east, after, the, classical, period, during, the, middle, ages, many, free, cities, developed, again, such, as, venice, the, modern, type, of, republic, itself, is, different, from, any, type, of, state, found, in, the, classical, world, nevertheless, there, are, a, number, of, states, of, the, classical, era, that, are, today, still, called, republics, this, includes, ancient, athens, and, the, roman, republic, while, the, structure, and, governance, of, these, states, was, different, from, that, of, any, modern, republic, there, is, debate, about, the, extent, to, which, classical, medieval, and, modern, republics, form, a, historical, continuum, j, g, a, pocock, has, argued, that, a, distinct, republican, tradition, stretches, from, the, classical, world, to, the, present, other, scholars, disagree, paul, rahe, for, instance, argues, that, the, classical, republics, had, a, form, of, government, with, few, links, to, those, in, any, modern, country, the, political, philosophy, of, the, classical, republics, has, influenced, republican, thought, throughout, the, subsequent, centuries, philosophers, and, politicians, advocating, republics, such, as, machiavelli, montesquieu, adams, and, madison, relied, heavily, on, classical, greek, and, roman, sources, which, described, various, types, of, regimes, aristotle, s, politics, discusses, various, forms, of, government, one, form, aristotle, named, politeia, which, consisted, of, a, mixture, of, the, other, forms, oligarchy, and, democracy, he, argued, that, this, was, one, of, the, ideal, forms, of, government, polybius, expanded, on, many, of, these, ideas, again, focusing, on, the, idea, of, mixed, government, and, differentiated, basic, forms, of, government, between, benign, monarchy, aristocracy, and, democracy, and, the, malignant, tyranny, oligarchy, and, ochlocracy, the, most, important, roman, work, in, this, tradition, is, cicero, s, de, re, publica, over, time, the, classical, republics, became, empires, or, were, conquered, by, empires, most, of, the, greek, republics, were, annexed, to, the, macedonian, empire, of, alexander, the, roman, republic, expanded, dramatically, conquering, the, other, states, of, the, mediterranean, that, could, be, considered, republics, such, as, carthage, the, roman, republic, itself, then, became, the, roman, empire, the, term, republic, is, not, commonly, used, to, refer, to, pre, classical, city, states, especially, if, outside, europe, and, the, area, which, was, under, graeco, roman, influence, however, some, early, states, outside, europe, had, governments, that, are, sometimes, today, considered, similar, to, republics, in, the, ancient, near, east, a, number, of, cities, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, achieved, collective, rule, republic, city, states, flourished, in, phoenicia, along, the, levantine, coast, starting, from, the, 11th, century, bc, in, ancient, phoenicia, the, concept, of, shophet, was, very, similar, to, a, roman, consul, under, persian, rule, 539, 332, bc, phoenician, city, states, such, as, tyre, abolished, the, king, system, and, adopted, a, system, of, the, suffetes, judges, who, remained, in, power, for, short, mandates, of, 6, years, arwad, has, been, cited, as, one, of, the, earliest, known, examples, of, a, republic, in, which, the, people, rather, than, a, monarch, are, described, as, sovereign, the, israelite, confederation, of, the, era, of, the, judges, before, the, united, monarchy, has, also, been, considered, a, type, of, republic, the, system, of, government, of, the, igbo, people, in, what, is, now, nigeria, has, been, described, as, direct, and, participatory, democracy, early, republican, institutions, come, from, the, independent, ga, asa, gha, s, ga, a, means, tribe, and, sa, gha, means, assembly, which, may, have, existed, as, early, as, the, 6th, century, bc, and, persisted, in, some, areas, until, the, 4th, century, ad, in, india, the, evidence, for, this, is, scattered, however, and, no, pure, historical, source, exists, for, that, period, diodorus, a, greek, historian, who, wrote, two, centuries, after, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, s, invasion, of, india, now, pakistan, and, northwest, india, mentions, without, offering, any, detail, that, independent, and, democratic, states, existed, in, india, modern, scholars, note, the, word, democracy, at, the, time, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, later, suffered, from, degradation, and, could, mean, any, autonomous, state, no, matter, how, aristocratic, in, nature, key, characteristics, of, the, ga, a, seem, to, include, a, ga, a, mukhya, chief, and, a, deliberative, assembly, the, assembly, met, regularly, it, discussed, all, major, state, decisions, at, least, in, some, states, attendance, was, open, to, all, free, men, this, body, also, had, full, financial, administrative, and, judicial, authority, other, officers, who, rarely, receive, any, mention, obeyed, the, decisions, of, the, assembly, elected, by, the, ga, a, the, chief, apparently, always, belonged, to, a, family, of, the, noble, class, of, kshatriya, varna, the, chief, coordinated, his, activities, with, the, assembly, in, some, states, he, did, so, with, a, council, of, other, nobles, the, licchavis, had, a, primary, governing, body, of, 7, 077, ga, a, mukhyas, the, heads, of, the, most, important, families, on, the, other, hand, the, shakyas, koliyas, mallakas, and, licchavis, during, the, period, around, gautama, buddha, had, the, assembly, open, to, all, men, rich, and, poor, early, republics, or, ga, asa, gha, such, as, mallakas, centered, in, the, city, of, kusinagara, and, the, vajjika, or, v, jika, league, centered, in, the, city, of, vaishali, existed, as, early, as, the, 6th, century, bc, and, persisted, in, some, areas, until, the, 4th, century, ad, the, most, famous, clan, amongst, the, ruling, confederate, clans, of, the, vajji, mahajanapada, were, the, licchavis, the, empire, of, magadha, included, republican, communities, such, as, the, community, of, rajakumara, villages, had, their, own, assemblies, under, their, local, chiefs, called, gramakas, their, administrations, were, divided, into, executive, judicial, and, military, functions, scholars, differ, over, how, best, to, describe, these, governments, and, the, vague, sporadic, quality, of, the, evidence, allows, for, wide, disagreements, some, emphasize, the, central, role, of, the, assemblies, and, thus, tout, them, as, democracies, other, scholars, focus, on, the, upper, class, domination, of, the, leadership, and, possible, control, of, the, assembly, and, see, an, aristocracy, despite, the, assembly, s, obvious, power, it, has, not, yet, been, established, whether, the, composition, and, participation, were, truly, popular, this, is, reflected, in, the, arthashastra, an, ancient, handbook, for, monarchs, on, how, to, rule, efficiently, it, contains, a, chapter, on, how, to, deal, with, the, sa, gha, s, which, includes, injunctions, on, manipulating, the, noble, leaders, yet, it, does, not, mention, how, to, influence, the, mass, of, the, citizens, indicating, that, the, ga, asa, gha, are, more, of, an, aristocratic, republic, than, democracy, the, icelandic, commonwealth, was, established, in, 930, ad, by, refugees, from, norway, who, had, fled, the, unification, of, that, country, under, king, harald, fairhair, the, commonwealth, consisted, of, a, number, of, clans, run, by, chieftains, and, the, althing, was, a, combination, of, parliament, and, supreme, court, where, disputes, appealed, from, lower, courts, were, settled, laws, were, decided, and, decisions, of, national, importance, were, taken, one, such, example, was, the, christianisation, of, iceland, in, 1000, where, the, althing, decreed, that, all, icelanders, must, be, baptized, into, christianity, and, forbade, celebration, of, pagan, rituals, contrary, to, most, states, the, icelandic, commonwealth, had, no, official, leader, in, the, early, 13th, century, the, age, of, the, sturlungs, the, commonwealth, began, to, suffer, from, long, conflicts, between, warring, clans, this, combined, with, pressure, from, the, norwegian, king, haakon, iv, for, the, icelanders, to, rejoin, the, norwegian, family, led, the, icelandic, chieftains, to, accept, haakon, iv, as, king, by, the, signing, of, the, gamli, s, ttm, li, old, covenant, in, 1262, this, effectively, brought, the, commonwealth, to, an, end, the, althing, however, is, still, iceland, s, parliament, almost, 800, years, later, in, europe, new, republics, appeared, in, the, late, middle, ages, when, a, number, of, small, states, embraced, republican, systems, of, government, these, were, generally, small, but, wealthy, trading, states, like, the, mediterranean, maritime, republics, and, the, hanseatic, league, in, which, the, merchant, class, had, risen, to, prominence, knud, haakonssen, has, noted, that, by, the, renaissance, europe, was, divided, with, those, states, controlled, by, a, landed, elite, being, monarchies, and, those, controlled, by, a, commercial, elite, being, republics, italy, was, the, most, densely, populated, area, of, europe, and, also, one, with, the, weakest, central, government, many, of, the, towns, thus, gained, considerable, independence, and, adopted, commune, forms, of, government, completely, free, of, feudal, control, the, italian, city, states, expanded, gaining, control, of, the, rural, hinterland, the, two, most, powerful, were, the, republic, of, venice, and, its, rival, the, republic, of, genoa, each, were, large, trading, ports, and, further, expanded, by, using, naval, power, to, control, large, parts, of, the, mediterranean, it, was, in, italy, that, an, ideology, advocating, for, republics, first, developed, writers, such, as, bartholomew, of, lucca, brunetto, latini, marsilius, of, padua, and, leonardo, bruni, saw, the, medieval, city, states, as, heirs, to, the, legacy, of, greece, and, rome, across, europe, a, wealthy, merchant, class, developed, in, the, important, trading, cities, despite, their, wealth, they, had, little, power, in, the, feudal, system, dominated, by, the, rural, land, owners, and, across, europe, began, to, advocate, for, their, own, privileges, and, powers, the, more, centralized, states, such, as, france, and, england, granted, limited, city, charters, in, the, more, loosely, governed, holy, roman, empire, 51, of, the, largest, towns, became, free, imperial, cities, while, still, under, the, dominion, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, most, power, was, held, locally, and, many, adopted, republican, forms, of, government, the, same, rights, to, imperial, immediacy, were, secured, by, the, major, trading, cities, of, switzerland, the, towns, and, villages, of, alpine, switzerland, had, courtesy, of, geography, also, been, largely, excluded, from, central, control, unlike, italy, and, germany, much, of, the, rural, area, was, thus, not, controlled, by, feudal, barons, but, by, independent, farmers, who, also, used, communal, forms, of, government, when, the, habsburgs, tried, to, reassert, control, over, the, region, both, rural, farmers, and, town, merchants, joined, the, rebellion, the, swiss, were, victorious, and, the, swiss, confederacy, was, proclaimed, and, switzerland, has, retained, a, republican, form, of, government, to, the, present, two, russian, cities, with, a, powerful, merchant, class, novgorod, and, pskov, also, adopted, republican, forms, of, government, in, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, respectively, which, ended, when, the, republics, were, conquered, by, muscovy, russia, at, the, end, of, 15th, beginning, of, 16th, century, following, the, collapse, of, the, seljuk, sultanate, of, rum, and, establishment, of, the, turkish, anatolian, beyliks, the, ahiler, merchant, fraternities, established, a, state, centered, on, ankara, that, is, sometimes, compared, to, the, italian, mercantile, republics, the, dominant, form, of, government, for, these, early, republics, was, control, by, a, limited, council, of, elite, patricians, in, those, areas, that, held, elections, property, qualifications, or, guild, membership, limited, both, who, could, vote, and, who, could, run, in, many, states, no, direct, elections, were, held, and, council, members, were, hereditary, or, appointed, by, the, existing, council, this, left, the, great, majority, of, the, population, without, political, power, and, riots, and, revolts, by, the, lower, classes, were, common, the, late, middle, ages, saw, more, than, 200, such, risings, in, the, towns, of, the, holy, roman, empire, similar, revolts, occurred, in, italy, notably, the, ciompi, revolt, in, florence, while, the, classical, writers, had, been, the, primary, ideological, source, for, the, republics, of, italy, in, northern, europe, the, protestant, reformation, would, be, used, as, justification, for, establishing, new, republics, most, important, was, calvinist, theology, which, developed, in, the, swiss, confederacy, one, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, of, the, medieval, republics, john, calvin, did, not, call, for, the, abolition, of, monarchy, but, he, advanced, the, doctrine, that, the, faithful, had, the, duty, to, overthrow, irreligious, monarchs, advocacy, for, republics, appeared, in, the, writings, of, the, huguenots, during, the, french, wars, of, religion, calvinism, played, an, important, role, in, the, republican, revolts, in, england, and, the, netherlands, like, the, city, states, of, italy, and, the, hanseatic, league, both, were, important, trading, centres, with, a, large, merchant, class, prospering, from, the, trade, with, the, new, world, large, parts, of, the, population, of, both, areas, also, embraced, calvinism, during, the, dutch, revolt, beginning, in, 1566, the, dutch, republic, emerged, from, rejection, of, spanish, habsburg, rule, however, the, country, did, not, adopt, the, republican, form, of, government, immediately, in, the, formal, declaration, of, independence, act, of, abjuration, 1581, the, throne, of, king, philip, was, only, declared, vacant, and, the, dutch, magistrates, asked, the, duke, of, anjou, queen, elizabeth, of, england, and, prince, william, of, orange, one, after, another, to, replace, philip, it, took, until, 1588, before, the, estates, the, staten, the, representative, assembly, at, the, time, decided, to, vest, the, sovereignty, of, the, country, in, themselves, in, 1641, the, english, civil, war, began, spearheaded, by, the, puritans, and, funded, by, the, merchants, of, london, the, revolt, was, a, success, and, king, charles, i, was, executed, in, england, james, harrington, algernon, sidney, and, john, milton, became, some, of, the, first, writers, to, argue, for, rejecting, monarchy, and, embracing, a, republican, form, of, government, the, english, commonwealth, was, short, lived, and, the, monarchy, was, soon, restored, the, dutch, republic, continued, in, name, until, 1795, but, by, the, mid, 18th, century, the, stadtholder, had, become, a, de, facto, monarch, calvinists, were, also, some, of, the, earliest, settlers, of, the, british, and, dutch, colonies, of, north, america, along, with, these, initial, republican, revolts, early, modern, europe, also, saw, a, great, increase, in, monarchical, power, the, era, of, absolute, monarchy, replaced, the, limited, and, decentralized, monarchies, that, had, existed, in, most, of, the, middle, ages, it, also, saw, a, reaction, against, the, total, control, of, the, monarch, as, a, series, of, writers, created, the, ideology, known, as, liberalism, most, of, these, enlightenment, thinkers, were, far, more, interested, in, ideas, of, constitutional, monarchy, than, in, republics, the, cromwell, regime, had, discredited, republicanism, and, most, thinkers, felt, that, republics, ended, in, either, anarchy, or, tyranny, thus, philosophers, like, voltaire, opposed, absolutism, while, at, the, same, time, being, strongly, pro, monarchy, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, montesquieu, praised, republics, and, looked, on, the, city, states, of, greece, as, a, model, however, both, also, felt, that, a, state, like, france, with, 20, million, people, would, be, impossible, to, govern, as, a, republic, rousseau, admired, the, republican, experiment, in, corsica, 1755, 1769, and, described, his, ideal, political, structure, of, small, self, governing, communes, montesquieu, felt, that, a, city, state, should, ideally, be, a, republic, but, maintained, that, a, limited, monarchy, was, better, suited, to, a, state, with, a, larger, territory, the, american, revolution, began, as, a, rejection, only, of, the, authority, of, the, british, parliament, over, the, colonies, not, of, the, monarchy, the, failure, of, the, british, monarch, to, protect, the, colonies, from, what, they, considered, the, infringement, of, their, rights, to, representative, government, the, monarch, s, branding, of, those, requesting, redress, as, traitors, and, his, support, for, sending, combat, troops, to, demonstrate, authority, resulted, in, widespread, perception, of, the, british, monarchy, as, tyrannical, with, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, the, leaders, of, the, revolt, firmly, rejected, the, monarchy, and, embraced, republicanism, the, leaders, of, the, revolution, were, well, versed, in, the, writings, of, the, french, liberal, thinkers, and, also, in, history, of, the, classical, republics, john, adams, had, notably, written, a, book, on, republics, throughout, history, in, addition, the, widely, distributed, and, popularly, read, aloud, tract, common, sense, by, thomas, paine, succinctly, and, eloquently, laid, out, the, case, for, republican, ideals, and, independence, to, the, larger, public, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, went, into, effect, in, 1789, created, a, relatively, strong, federal, republic, to, replace, the, relatively, weak, confederation, under, the, first, attempt, at, a, national, government, with, the, articles, of, confederation, and, perpetual, union, ratified, in, 1781, the, first, ten, amendments, to, the, constitution, called, the, united, states, bill, of, rights, guaranteed, certain, natural, rights, fundamental, to, republican, ideals, that, justified, the, revolution, the, french, revolution, was, also, not, republican, at, its, outset, only, after, the, flight, to, varennes, removed, most, of, the, remaining, sympathy, for, the, king, was, a, republic, declared, and, louis, xvi, sent, to, the, guillotine, the, stunning, success, of, france, in, the, french, revolutionary, wars, saw, republics, spread, by, force, of, arms, across, much, of, europe, as, a, series, of, client, republics, were, set, up, across, the, continent, the, rise, of, napoleon, saw, the, end, of, the, french, first, republic, and, her, sister, republics, each, replaced, by, popular, monarchies, throughout, the, napoleonic, period, the, victors, extinguished, many, of, the, oldest, republics, on, the, continent, including, the, republic, of, venice, the, republic, of, genoa, and, the, dutch, republic, they, were, eventually, transformed, into, monarchies, or, absorbed, into, neighboring, monarchies, outside, europe, another, group, of, republics, was, created, as, the, napoleonic, wars, allowed, the, states, of, latin, america, to, gain, their, independence, liberal, ideology, had, only, a, limited, impact, on, these, new, republics, the, main, impetus, was, the, local, european, descended, creole, population, in, conflict, with, the, peninsulares, governors, sent, from, overseas, the, majority, of, the, population, in, most, of, latin, america, was, of, either, african, or, amerindian, descent, and, the, creole, elite, had, little, interest, in, giving, these, groups, power, and, broad, based, popular, sovereignty, sim, n, bol, var, both, the, main, instigator, of, the, revolts, and, one, of, its, most, important, theorists, was, sympathetic, to, liberal, ideals, but, felt, that, latin, america, lacked, the, social, cohesion, for, such, a, system, to, function, and, advocated, autocracy, as, necessary, in, mexico, this, autocracy, briefly, took, the, form, of, a, monarchy, in, the, first, mexican, empire, due, to, the, peninsular, war, the, portuguese, court, was, relocated, to, brazil, in, 1808, brazil, gained, independence, as, a, monarchy, on, september, 7, 1822, and, the, empire, of, brazil, lasted, until, 1889, in, many, other, latin, american, states, various, forms, of, autocratic, republic, existed, until, most, were, liberalized, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, the, french, second, republic, was, created, in, 1848, but, abolished, by, napoleon, iii, who, proclaimed, himself, emperor, in, 1852, the, french, third, republic, was, established, in, 1870, when, a, civil, revolutionary, committee, refused, to, accept, napoleon, iii, s, surrender, during, the, franco, prussian, war, spain, briefly, became, the, first, spanish, republic, in, 1873, 74, but, the, monarchy, was, soon, restored, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, france, switzerland, and, san, marino, remained, the, only, republics, in, europe, this, changed, when, after, the, 1908, lisbon, regicide, the, 5, october, 1910, revolution, established, the, portuguese, republic, in, east, asia, china, had, seen, considerable, anti, qing, sentiment, during, the, 19th, century, and, a, number, of, protest, movements, developed, calling, for, constitutional, monarchy, the, most, important, leader, of, these, efforts, was, sun, yat, sen, whose, three, principles, of, the, people, combined, american, european, and, chinese, ideas, under, his, leadership, the, republic, of, china, was, proclaimed, on, january, 1, 1912, republican, ideas, were, spreading, especially, in, asia, the, united, states, began, to, have, considerable, influence, in, east, asia, in, the, later, part, of, the, 19th, century, with, protestant, missionaries, playing, a, central, role, the, liberal, and, republican, writers, of, the, west, also, exerted, influence, these, combined, with, native, confucian, inspired, political, philosophy, that, had, long, argued, that, the, populace, had, the, right, to, reject, unjust, governments, that, had, lost, the, mandate, of, heaven, during, this, period, two, short, lived, republics, were, proclaimed, in, east, asia, the, republic, of, formosa, and, the, first, philippine, republic, republicanism, expanded, significantly, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, when, several, of, the, largest, european, empires, collapsed, the, russian, empire, 1917, german, empire, 1918, austro, hungarian, empire, 1918, and, ottoman, empire, 1922, were, all, replaced, by, republics, new, states, gained, independence, during, this, turmoil, and, many, of, these, such, as, ireland, poland, finland, and, czechoslovakia, chose, republican, forms, of, government, following, greece, s, defeat, in, the, greco, turkish, war, 1919, 22, the, monarchy, was, briefly, replaced, by, the, second, hellenic, republic, 1924, 35, in, 1931, the, proclamation, of, the, second, spanish, republic, 1931, 39, resulted, in, the, spanish, civil, war, leading, to, the, establishment, of, a, francoist, regime, the, aftermath, of, world, war, ii, left, italy, with, a, destroyed, economy, a, divided, society, and, anger, against, the, monarchy, for, its, endorsement, of, the, fascist, regime, these, frustrations, contributed, to, a, revival, of, the, italian, republican, movement, king, umberto, ii, was, pressured, to, call, the, 1946, italian, institutional, referendum, to, decide, whether, italy, should, remain, a, monarchy, or, become, a, republic, the, supporters, of, the, republic, chose, the, effigy, of, the, italia, turrita, the, national, personification, of, italy, as, their, unitary, symbol, to, be, used, in, the, electoral, campaign, and, on, the, referendum, ballot, on, the, institutional, form, of, the, state, in, contrast, to, the, savoy, coat, of, arms, which, represented, the, monarchy, on, june, 2, 1946, the, republican, side, won, 54, 3, of, the, vote, and, italy, officially, became, a, republic, a, day, celebrated, since, as, festa, della, repubblica, italy, has, a, written, democratic, constitution, resulting, from, the, work, of, a, constituent, assembly, formed, by, the, representatives, of, all, the, anti, fascist, forces, that, contributed, to, the, defeat, of, nazi, and, fascist, forces, during, the, liberation, of, italy, in, the, years, following, world, war, ii, most, of, the, remaining, european, colonies, gained, their, independence, and, most, became, republics, the, two, largest, colonial, powers, were, france, and, the, united, kingdom, republican, france, encouraged, the, establishment, of, republics, in, its, former, colonies, the, united, kingdom, attempted, to, follow, the, model, it, had, for, its, earlier, settler, colonies, of, creating, independent, commonwealth, realms, still, linked, under, the, same, monarch, while, most, of, the, settler, colonies, and, the, smaller, states, in, the, caribbean, and, the, pacific, retained, this, system, it, was, rejected, by, the, newly, independent, countries, in, africa, and, asia, which, revised, their, constitutions, and, became, republics, instead, britain, followed, a, different, model, in, the, middle, east, it, installed, local, monarchies, in, several, colonies, and, mandates, including, iraq, jordan, kuwait, bahrain, oman, yemen, and, libya, in, subsequent, decades, revolutions, and, coups, overthrew, a, number, of, monarchs, and, installed, republics, several, monarchies, remain, and, the, middle, east, is, the, only, part, of, the, world, where, several, large, states, are, ruled, by, monarchs, with, almost, complete, political, control, in, the, wake, of, the, first, world, war, the, russian, monarchy, fell, during, the, russian, revolution, the, russian, provisional, government, was, established, in, its, place, on, the, lines, of, a, liberal, republic, but, this, was, overthrown, by, the, bolsheviks, who, went, on, to, establish, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, ussr, this, was, the, first, republic, established, under, marxist, leninist, ideology, communism, was, wholly, opposed, to, monarchy, and, became, an, important, element, of, many, republican, movements, during, the, 20th, century, the, russian, revolution, spread, into, mongolia, and, overthrew, its, theocratic, monarchy, in, 1924, in, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, the, communists, gradually, gained, control, of, romania, bulgaria, yugoslavia, hungary, and, albania, ensuring, that, the, states, were, reestablished, as, socialist, republics, rather, than, monarchies, communism, also, intermingled, with, other, ideologies, it, was, embraced, by, many, national, liberation, movements, during, decolonization, in, vietnam, communist, republicans, pushed, aside, the, nguy, n, dynasty, and, monarchies, in, neighbouring, laos, and, cambodia, were, overthrown, by, communist, movements, in, the, 1970s, arab, socialism, contributed, to, a, series, of, revolts, and, coups, that, saw, the, monarchies, of, egypt, iraq, libya, and, yemen, ousted, in, africa, marxism, leninism, and, african, socialism, led, to, the, end, of, monarchy, and, the, proclamation, of, republics, in, states, such, as, burundi, and, ethiopia, islamic, political, philosophy, has, a, long, history, of, opposition, to, absolute, monarchy, notably, in, the, work, of, al, farabi, sharia, law, took, precedence, over, the, will, of, the, ruler, and, electing, rulers, by, means, of, the, shura, was, an, important, doctrine, while, the, early, caliphate, see, rashidun, caliphate, maintained, the, principles, of, an, elected, ruler, later, states, became, hereditary, or, military, dictatorships, though, many, maintained, some, pretense, of, a, consultative, shura, none, of, these, states, are, typically, referred, to, as, republics, the, current, usage, of, republic, in, muslim, countries, is, borrowed, from, the, western, meaning, adopted, into, the, language, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, 20th, century, saw, republicanism, become, an, important, idea, in, much, of, the, middle, east, as, monarchies, were, removed, in, many, states, of, the, region, iraq, became, a, secular, state, some, nations, such, as, indonesia, and, azerbaijan, began, as, secular, in, iran, the, 1979, revolution, overthrew, the, monarchy, and, created, an, islamic, republic, based, on, the, ideas, of, islamic, democracy, a, republic, does, not, necessarily, have, a, constitution, but, is, often, constitutional, in, the, sense, of, constitutionalism, meaning, that, it, is, constituted, by, a, set, of, institutions, which, provide, a, separation, of, powers, the, term, constitutional, republic, is, a, way, to, highlight, an, emphasis, of, the, separation, of, powers, in, a, given, republic, as, with, constitutional, monarchy, or, absolute, monarchy, highlighting, the, absolute, autocratic, character, of, a, monarchy, with, no, monarch, most, modern, republics, use, the, title, president, for, the, head, of, state, originally, used, to, refer, to, the, presiding, officer, of, a, committee, or, governing, body, in, great, britain, the, usage, was, also, applied, to, political, leaders, including, the, leaders, of, some, of, the, thirteen, colonies, originally, virginia, in, 1608, in, full, the, president, of, the, council, the, first, republic, to, adopt, the, title, was, the, united, states, of, america, keeping, its, usage, as, the, head, of, a, committee, the, president, of, the, continental, congress, was, the, leader, of, the, original, congress, when, the, new, constitution, was, written, the, title, of, president, of, the, united, states, was, conferred, on, the, head, of, the, new, executive, branch, if, the, head, of, state, of, a, republic, is, also, the, head, of, government, this, is, called, a, presidential, system, there, are, a, number, of, forms, of, presidential, government, a, full, presidential, system, has, a, president, with, substantial, authority, and, a, central, political, role, in, other, states, the, legislature, is, dominant, and, the, presidential, role, is, almost, purely, ceremonial, and, apolitical, such, as, in, germany, italy, india, and, trinidad, and, tobago, these, states, are, parliamentary, republics, and, operate, similarly, to, constitutional, monarchies, with, parliamentary, systems, where, the, power, of, the, monarch, is, also, greatly, circumscribed, in, parliamentary, systems, the, head, of, government, most, often, titled, prime, minister, exercises, the, most, real, political, power, semi, presidential, systems, have, a, president, as, an, active, head, of, state, with, important, powers, but, they, also, have, a, prime, minister, as, a, head, of, government, with, important, powers, the, rules, for, appointing, the, president, and, the, leader, of, the, government, in, some, republics, permit, the, appointment, of, a, president, and, a, prime, minister, who, have, opposing, political, convictions, in, france, when, the, members, of, the, ruling, cabinet, and, the, president, come, from, opposing, political, factions, this, situation, is, called, cohabitation, in, some, countries, like, bosnia, and, herzegovina, san, marino, and, switzerland, the, head, of, state, is, not, a, single, person, but, a, committee, council, of, several, persons, holding, that, office, the, roman, republic, had, two, consuls, elected, for, a, one, year, term, by, the, comitia, centuriata, consisting, of, all, adult, freeborn, males, who, could, prove, citizenship, in, liberal, democracies, presidents, are, elected, either, directly, by, the, people, or, indirectly, by, a, parliament, or, council, typically, in, presidential, and, semi, presidential, systems, the, president, is, directly, elected, by, the, people, or, is, indirectly, elected, as, done, in, the, united, states, in, that, country, the, president, is, officially, elected, by, an, electoral, college, chosen, by, the, states, all, u, s, states, have, chosen, electors, by, popular, election, since, 1832, the, indirect, election, of, the, president, through, the, electoral, college, conforms, to, the, concept, of, republic, as, one, with, a, system, of, indirect, election, in, the, opinion, of, some, direct, election, confers, legitimacy, upon, the, president, and, gives, the, office, much, of, its, political, power, however, this, concept, of, legitimacy, differs, from, that, expressed, in, the, united, states, constitution, which, established, the, legitimacy, of, the, united, states, president, as, resulting, from, the, signing, of, the, constitution, by, nine, states, the, idea, that, direct, election, is, required, for, legitimacy, also, contradicts, the, spirit, of, the, great, compromise, whose, actual, result, was, manifest, in, the, clause, that, provides, voters, in, smaller, states, with, more, representation, in, presidential, selection, than, those, in, large, states, for, example, citizens, of, wyoming, in, 2016, had, 3, 6, times, as, much, electoral, vote, representation, as, citizens, of, california, in, states, with, a, parliamentary, system, the, president, is, usually, elected, by, the, parliament, this, indirect, election, subordinates, the, president, to, the, parliament, and, also, gives, the, president, limited, legitimacy, and, turns, most, presidential, powers, into, reserve, powers, that, can, only, be, exercised, under, rare, circumstance, there, are, exceptions, where, elected, presidents, have, only, ceremonial, powers, such, as, in, ireland, the, distinction, between, a, republic, and, a, monarchy, is, not, always, clear, the, constitutional, monarchies, of, the, former, british, empire, and, western, europe, today, have, almost, all, real, political, power, vested, in, the, elected, representatives, with, the, monarchs, only, holding, either, theoretical, powers, no, powers, or, rarely, used, reserve, powers, real, legitimacy, for, political, decisions, comes, from, the, elected, representatives, and, is, derived, from, the, will, of, the, people, while, hereditary, monarchies, remain, in, place, political, power, is, derived, from, the, people, as, in, a, republic, these, states, are, thus, sometimes, referred, to, as, crowned, republics, terms, such, as, liberal, republic, are, also, used, to, describe, all, of, the, modern, liberal, democracies, there, are, also, self, proclaimed, republics, that, act, similarly, to, absolute, monarchies, with, absolute, power, vested, in, the, leader, and, passed, down, from, father, to, son, north, korea, and, syria, are, two, notable, examples, where, a, son, has, inherited, political, control, neither, of, these, states, are, officially, monarchies, there, is, no, constitutional, requirement, that, power, be, passed, down, within, one, family, but, it, has, occurred, in, practice, there, are, also, elective, monarchies, where, ultimate, power, is, vested, in, a, monarch, but, the, monarch, is, chosen, by, some, manner, of, election, a, current, example, of, such, a, state, is, malaysia, where, the, yang, di, pertuan, agong, is, elected, every, five, years, by, the, conference, of, rulers, composed, of, the, nine, hereditary, rulers, of, the, malay, states, and, the, vatican, city, state, where, the, pope, is, selected, by, cardinal, electors, currently, all, cardinals, under, the, age, of, 80, while, rare, today, elective, monarchs, were, common, in, the, past, the, holy, roman, empire, is, an, important, example, where, each, new, emperor, was, chosen, by, a, group, of, electors, islamic, states, also, rarely, employed, primogeniture, instead, relying, on, various, forms, of, election, to, choose, a, monarch, s, successor, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, had, an, elective, monarchy, with, a, wide, suffrage, of, some, 500, 000, nobles, the, system, known, as, the, golden, liberty, had, developed, as, a, method, for, powerful, landowners, to, control, the, crown, the, proponents, of, this, system, looked, to, classical, examples, and, the, writings, of, the, italian, renaissance, and, called, their, elective, monarchy, a, rzeczpospolita, based, on, res, publica, in, general, being, a, republic, also, implies, sovereignty, as, for, the, state, to, be, ruled, by, the, people, it, cannot, be, controlled, by, a, foreign, power, there, are, important, exceptions, to, this, for, example, republics, in, the, soviet, union, were, member, states, which, had, to, meet, three, criteria, to, be, named, republics, it, is, sometimes, argued, that, the, former, soviet, union, was, also, a, supra, national, republic, based, on, the, claim, that, the, member, states, were, different, nation, states, the, socialist, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, was, a, federal, entity, composed, of, six, republics, socialist, republic, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, croatia, macedonia, montenegro, serbia, and, slovenia, each, republic, had, its, parliament, government, institute, of, citizenship, constitution, etc, but, certain, functions, were, delegated, to, the, federation, army, monetary, matters, each, republic, also, had, a, right, of, self, determination, according, to, the, conclusions, of, the, second, session, of, the, avnoj, and, according, to, the, federal, constitution, in, switzerland, all, cantons, can, be, considered, to, have, a, republican, form, of, government, with, constitutions, legislatures, executives, and, courts, many, of, them, being, originally, sovereign, states, as, a, consequence, several, romance, speaking, cantons, are, still, officially, referred, to, as, republics, reflecting, their, history, and, will, of, independence, within, the, swiss, confederation, notable, examples, are, the, republic, and, canton, of, geneva, and, the, republic, and, canton, of, ticino, states, of, the, united, states, are, required, like, the, federal, government, to, be, republican, in, form, with, final, authority, resting, with, the, people, this, was, required, because, the, states, were, intended, to, create, and, enforce, most, domestic, laws, with, the, exception, of, areas, delegated, to, the, federal, government, and, prohibited, to, the, states, the, founders, of, the, country, intended, most, domestic, laws, to, be, handled, by, the, states, requiring, the, states, to, be, a, republic, in, form, was, seen, as, protecting, the, citizens, rights, and, preventing, a, state, from, becoming, a, dictatorship, or, monarchy, and, reflected, unwillingness, on, the, part, of, the, original, 13, states, all, independent, republics, to, unite, with, other, states, that, were, not, republics, additionally, this, requirement, ensured, that, only, other, republics, could, join, the, union, in, the, example, of, the, united, states, the, original, 13, british, colonies, became, independent, states, after, the, american, revolution, each, having, a, republican, form, of, government, these, independent, states, initially, formed, a, loose, confederation, called, the, united, states, and, then, later, formed, the, current, united, states, by, ratifying, the, current, u, s, constitution, creating, a, union, that, was, a, republic, any, state, joining, the, union, later, was, also, required, to, be, a, republic, before, the, 17th, century, the, term, republic, could, be, used, to, refer, to, states, of, any, form, of, government, as, long, as, it, was, not, a, tyrannical, regime, french, philosopher, jean, bodin, s, definition, of, the, republic, was, the, rightly, ordered, government, of, a, number, of, families, and, of, those, things, which, are, their, common, concern, by, a, sovereign, power, oligarchies, and, monarchies, could, also, be, included, as, they, were, also, organised, toward, public, shared, interests, in, medieval, texts, republic, was, used, to, refer, to, the, body, of, shared, interest, with, the, king, at, its, head, for, instance, the, holy, roman, empire, was, also, known, as, the, sancta, respublica, romana, the, holy, roman, republic, the, byzantine, empire, also, continued, calling, itself, the, roman, republic, as, the, byzantines, did, not, regard, monarchy, as, a, contradiction, to, republicanism, instead, republics, were, defined, as, any, state, based, on, popular, sovereignty, and, whose, institutions, were, based, on, shared, values, while, the, term, democracy, has, been, used, interchangeably, with, the, term, republic, by, some, others, have, made, sharp, distinctions, between, the, two, for, millennia, montesquieu, founder, of, the, modern, constitutional, state, repeated, in, his, the, spirit, of, the, laws, of, 1748, the, insight, that, aristotle, had, expressed, two, millennia, earlier, voting, by, lot, is, in, the, nature, of, democracy, voting, by, choice, is, in, the, nature, of, aristocracy, additional, critics, of, elections, include, rousseau, robespierre, and, marat, who, said, of, the, new, french, republic, what, use, is, it, to, us, that, we, have, broken, the, aristocracy, of, the, nobles, if, that, is, replaced, by, the, aristocracy, of, the, rich, the, term, republic, originated, from, the, writers, of, the, renaissance, as, a, descriptive, term, for, states, that, were, not, monarchies, these, writers, such, as, machiavelli, also, wrote, important, prescriptive, works, describing, how, such, governments, should, function, these, ideas, of, how, a, government, and, society, should, be, structured, is, the, basis, for, an, ideology, known, as, classical, republicanism, or, civic, humanism, this, ideology, is, based, on, the, roman, republic, and, the, city, states, of, ancient, greece, and, focuses, on, ideals, such, as, civic, virtue, rule, of, law, and, mixed, government, this, understanding, of, a, republic, as, a, form, of, government, distinct, from, a, liberal, democracy, is, one, of, the, main, theses, of, the, cambridge, school, of, historical, analysis, this, grew, out, of, the, work, of, j, g, a, pocock, who, in, 1975, argued, that, a, series, of, scholars, had, expressed, a, consistent, set, of, republican, ideals, these, writers, included, machiavelli, milton, montesquieu, and, the, founders, of, the, united, states, of, america, pocock, argued, that, this, was, an, ideology, with, a, history, and, principles, distinct, from, liberalism, these, ideas, were, embraced, by, a, number, of, different, writers, including, quentin, skinner, philip, pettit, and, cass, sunstein, these, subsequent, writers, have, further, explored, the, history, of, the, idea, and, also, outlined, how, a, modern, republic, should, function, a, distinct, set, of, definitions, of, the, term, republic, evolved, in, the, united, states, where, the, term, is, often, equated, with, representative, democracy, this, narrower, understanding, of, the, term, was, originally, developed, by, james, madison, and, notably, employed, in, federalist, paper, no, 10, this, meaning, was, widely, adopted, early, in, the, history, of, the, united, states, including, in, noah, webster, s, dictionary, of, 1828, it, was, a, novel, meaning, to, the, term, representative, democracy, was, not, an, idea, mentioned, by, machiavelli, and, did, not, exist, in, the, classical, republics, there, is, also, evidence, that, contemporaries, of, madison, considered, the, meaning, of, republic, to, reflect, the, broader, definition, found, elsewhere, as, is, the, case, with, a, quotation, of, benjamin, franklin, taken, from, the, notes, of, james, mchenry, where, the, question, is, put, forth, a, republic, or, a, monarchy, the, term, republic, does, not, appear, in, the, declaration, of, independence, but, it, does, appear, in, article, iv, of, the, constitution, which, guarantee, to, every, state, in, this, union, a, republican, form, of, government, what, exactly, the, writers, of, the, constitution, felt, this, should, mean, is, uncertain, the, supreme, court, in, luther, v, borden, 1849, declared, that, the, definition, of, republic, was, a, political, question, in, which, it, would, not, intervene, in, two, later, cases, it, did, establish, a, basic, definition, in, united, states, v, cruikshank, 1875, the, court, ruled, that, the, equal, rights, of, citizens, were, inherent, to, the, idea, of, a, republic, however, the, term, republic, is, not, synonymous, with, the, republican, form, the, republican, form, is, defined, as, one, in, which, the, powers, of, sovereignty, are, vested, in, the, people, and, are, exercised, by, the, people, either, directly, or, through, representatives, chosen, by, the, people, to, whom, those, powers, are, specially, delegated, beyond, these, basic, definitions, the, word, republic, has, a, number, of, other, connotations, w, paul, adams, observes, that, republic, is, most, often, used, in, the, united, states, as, a, synonym, for, state, or, government, but, with, more, positive, connotations, than, either, of, those, terms, republicanism, is, often, referred, to, as, the, founding, ideology, of, the, united, states, traditionally, scholars, believed, this, american, republicanism, was, a, derivation, of, the, classical, liberal, ideologies, of, john, locke, and, others, developed, in, europe, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, bernard, bailyn, began, to, argue, that, republicanism, was, just, as, or, even, more, important, than, liberalism, in, the, creation, of, the, united, states, this, issue, is, still, much, disputed, and, scholars, like, isaac, kramnick, completely, reject, this, view
