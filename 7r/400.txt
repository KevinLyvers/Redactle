nordic, council, danish, d, e, n, day, nish, endonym, dansk, pronounced, dansk, sprog, is, a, north, germanic, language, from, the, indo, european, language, family, spoken, by, about, six, million, people, principally, in, and, around, denmark, communities, of, danish, speakers, are, also, found, in, greenland, the, faroe, islands, and, the, northern, german, region, of, southern, schleswig, where, it, has, minority, language, status, minor, danish, speaking, communities, are, also, found, in, norway, sweden, the, united, states, canada, brazil, and, argentina, along, with, the, other, north, germanic, languages, danish, is, a, descendant, of, old, norse, the, common, language, of, the, germanic, peoples, who, lived, in, scandinavia, during, the, viking, era, danish, together, with, swedish, derives, from, the, east, norse, dialect, group, while, the, middle, norwegian, language, before, the, influence, of, danish, and, norwegian, bokm, l, are, classified, as, west, norse, along, with, faroese, and, icelandic, a, more, recent, classification, based, on, mutual, intelligibility, separates, modern, spoken, danish, norwegian, and, swedish, as, mainland, or, continental, scandinavian, while, icelandic, and, faroese, are, classified, as, insular, scandinavian, although, the, written, languages, are, compatible, spoken, danish, is, distinctly, different, from, norwegian, and, swedish, and, thus, the, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, with, either, is, variable, between, regions, and, speakers, until, the, 16th, century, danish, was, a, continuum, of, dialects, spoken, from, southern, jutland, and, schleswig, to, scania, with, no, standard, variety, or, spelling, conventions, with, the, protestant, reformation, and, the, introduction, of, the, printing, press, a, standard, language, was, developed, which, was, based, on, the, educated, dialect, of, copenhagen, and, malm, it, spread, through, use, in, the, education, system, and, administration, though, german, and, latin, continued, to, be, the, most, important, written, languages, well, into, the, 17th, century, following, the, loss, of, territory, to, germany, and, sweden, a, nationalist, movement, adopted, the, language, as, a, token, of, danish, identity, and, the, language, experienced, a, strong, surge, in, use, and, popularity, with, major, works, of, literature, produced, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, today, traditional, danish, dialects, have, all, but, disappeared, though, regional, variants, of, the, standard, language, exist, the, main, differences, in, language, are, between, generations, with, youth, language, being, particularly, innovative, danish, has, a, very, large, vowel, inventory, consisting, of, 27, phonemically, distinctive, vowels, and, its, prosody, is, characterized, by, the, distinctive, phenomenon, st, d, a, kind, of, laryngeal, phonation, type, due, to, the, many, pronunciation, differences, that, set, danish, apart, from, its, neighboring, languages, particularly, the, vowels, difficult, prosody, and, weakly, pronounced, consonants, it, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, a, difficult, language, to, learn, acquire, and, understand, and, some, evidence, shows, that, children, are, slower, to, acquire, the, phonological, distinctions, of, danish, compared, to, other, languages, the, grammar, is, moderately, inflective, with, strong, irregular, and, weak, regular, conjugations, and, inflections, nouns, adjectives, and, demonstrative, pronouns, distinguish, common, and, neutral, gender, like, english, danish, only, has, remnants, of, a, former, case, system, particularly, in, the, pronouns, unlike, english, it, has, lost, all, person, marking, on, verbs, its, word, order, is, v2, with, the, finite, verb, always, occupying, the, second, slot, in, the, sentence, danish, is, a, germanic, language, of, the, north, germanic, branch, other, names, for, this, group, are, the, nordic, or, scandinavian, languages, along, with, swedish, danish, descends, from, the, eastern, dialects, of, the, old, norse, language, danish, and, swedish, are, also, classified, as, east, scandinavian, or, east, nordic, languages, scandinavian, languages, are, often, considered, a, dialect, continuum, where, no, sharp, dividing, lines, are, seen, between, the, different, vernacular, languages, like, norwegian, and, swedish, danish, was, significantly, influenced, by, low, german, in, the, middle, ages, and, has, been, influenced, by, english, since, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, danish, itself, can, be, divided, into, three, main, dialect, areas, jutlandic, west, danish, insular, danish, including, the, standard, variety, and, east, danish, including, bornholmian, and, scanian, under, the, view, that, scandinavian, is, a, dialect, continuum, east, danish, can, be, considered, intermediary, between, danish, and, swedish, while, scanian, can, be, considered, a, swedified, east, danish, dialect, and, bornholmian, is, its, closest, relative, east, germanic, languages, west, germanic, languages, icelandic, faroese, norwegian, danish, swedish, approximately, 2, 000, uncompounded, danish, words, are, derived, from, old, norse, and, ultimately, from, proto, indo, european, of, these, 2, 000, 1, 200, are, nouns, 500, are, verbs, and, 180, are, adjectives, danish, has, also, absorbed, many, loanwords, most, of, which, were, borrowed, from, low, german, of, the, late, middle, ages, out, of, the, 500, most, frequently, used, danish, words, 100, are, loans, from, middle, low, german, this, is, because, low, german, was, the, second, official, language, of, denmark, norway, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, standard, german, and, french, superseded, low, german, influence, and, in, the, 20th, century, english, became, the, main, supplier, of, loanwords, especially, after, world, war, ii, although, many, old, nordic, words, remain, some, were, replaced, with, borrowed, synonyms, for, example, de, to, eat, was, mostly, supplanted, by, the, low, german, spise, as, well, as, loanwords, new, words, can, be, freely, formed, by, compounding, existing, words, in, standard, texts, of, contemporary, danish, middle, low, german, loans, account, for, about, 16, 17, of, the, vocabulary, graeco, latin, loans, 4, 8, french, 2, 4, and, english, about, 1, danish, and, english, are, both, germanic, languages, danish, is, a, north, germanic, language, descended, from, old, norse, and, english, is, a, west, germanic, language, descended, from, old, english, old, norse, exerted, a, strong, influence, on, old, english, in, the, early, medieval, period, the, shared, germanic, heritage, of, danish, and, english, is, demonstrated, with, many, common, words, that, are, very, similar, in, the, two, languages, for, example, when, written, commonly, used, danish, verbs, nouns, and, prepositions, such, as, have, over, under, for, give, flag, salt, and, arm, are, easily, recognizable, to, english, speakers, similarly, some, other, words, are, almost, identical, to, their, scots, equivalents, e, g, kirke, scots, kirk, i, e, church, or, barn, scots, bairn, i, e, child, in, addition, the, word, by, meaning, village, or, town, occurs, in, many, english, place, names, such, as, whitby, and, selby, as, remnants, of, the, viking, occupation, during, the, latter, period, english, adopted, are, the, third, person, plural, form, of, the, verb, to, be, as, well, as, the, personal, pronouns, they, them, and, their, from, contemporary, old, norse, danish, is, largely, mutually, intelligible, with, norwegian, and, swedish, a, proficient, speaker, of, any, of, the, three, languages, can, often, understand, the, others, fairly, well, though, studies, have, shown, that, the, mutual, intelligibility, is, asymmetric, norwegian, speakers, generally, understand, both, danish, and, swedish, far, better, than, swedes, or, danes, understand, each, other, concomitantly, swedes, and, danes, understand, norwegian, better, than, they, understand, each, other, s, languages, norwegian, occupies, the, middle, position, in, terms, of, intelligibility, because, of, its, shared, border, with, sweden, resulting, in, a, similarity, in, pronunciation, combined, with, the, long, tradition, of, having, danish, as, a, written, language, which, has, led, to, similarities, in, vocabulary, among, younger, danes, copenhageners, are, worse, at, understanding, swedish, than, danes, from, the, provinces, in, general, younger, danes, are, not, as, good, at, understanding, the, neighboring, languages, as, the, young, in, norway, and, sweden, the, danish, philologist, johannes, br, ndum, nielsen, divided, the, history, of, danish, into, a, period, from, 800, ad, to, 1525, to, be, old, danish, which, he, subdivided, into, runic, danish, 800, 1100, early, middle, danish, 1100, 1350, and, late, middle, danish, 1350, 1525,

runic, alphabet, first, with, the, elder, futhark, and, from, the, 9th, century, with, the, younger, futhark, from, the, seventh, century, the, common, norse, language, began, to, undergo, changes, that, did, not, spread, to, all, of, scandinavia, resulting, in, the, appearance, of, two, dialect, areas, old, west, norse, norway, and, iceland, and, old, east, norse, denmark, and, sweden, most, of, the, changes, separating, east, norse, from, west, norse, started, as, innovations, in, denmark, that, spread, through, scania, into, sweden, and, by, maritime, contact, to, southern, norway, a, change, that, separated, old, east, norse, runic, swedish, danish, from, old, west, norse, was, the, change, of, the, diphthong, i, old, west, norse, ei, to, the, monophthong, e, as, in, st, in, to, sten, this, is, reflected, in, runic, inscriptions, where, the, older, read, stain, and, the, later, stin, also, a, change, of, au, as, in, dau, r, into, as, in, d, r, occurred, this, change, is, shown, in, runic, inscriptions, as, a, change, from, tau, r, into, tu, r, moreover, the, y, old, west, norse, ey, diphthong, changed, into, as, well, as, in, the, old, norse, word, for, island, this, monophthongization, started, in, jutland, and, spread, eastward, having, spread, throughout, denmark, and, most, of, sweden, by, 1100, through, danish, conquest, old, east, norse, was, once, widely,

parts, of, eastern, england, colonized, by, danish, vikings, the, city, of, york, was, once, the, viking, settlement, of, jorvik, several, other, english, words, derive, from, old, east, norse, for, example, knife, kniv, husband, husbond, and, egg, g, the, suffix, by, for, town, is, common, in, place, names, in, yorkshire, and, the, east, midlands, for, example, selby, whitby, derby, and,

swedish, the, main, written, language, was, latin, and, the, few, danish, language, texts, preserved, from, this, period, are, written, in, the, latin, alphabet, although, the, runic, alphabet, seems, to, have, lingered, in, popular, usage, in, some, areas, the, main, text, types, written, in, this, period, are, laws, which, were, formulated, in, the, vernacular, language, to, be, accessible, also,

danish, was, in, contact, with, low, german, and, many, low, german, loan, words, were, introduced, in, this, period, with, the, protestant, reformation, in, 1536, danish, also, became, the, language, of, religion, which, sparked, a, new, interest, in, using, danish, as, a, literary, language, also, in, this, period, danish, began, to, take, on, the, linguistic, traits, that, differentiate, it, from, swedish, and, norwegian, such, as, the, st, d, the, voicing, of, many, stop, consonants, and, the, weakening, of, many, final, vowels, to, e, the, first, printed, book, in, danish, dates, from,

not, standardized, and, the, principles, for, doing, so, were, vigorously, discussed, among, danish, philologists, the, grammar, of, jens, pedersen, h, ysgaard, was, the, first, to, give, a, detailed, analysis, of, danish, phonology, and, prosody, including, a, description, of, the, st, d, in, this, period, scholars, were, also, discussing, whether, it, was, best, to, write, as, one, speaks, or, to, speak, as, one, writes, including, whether, archaic, grammatical, forms, that, had, fallen, out, of, use, in, the, vernacular, such, as, the, plural, form, of, verbs, should, be, conserved, in,

areas, where, danish, had, been, influential, including, all, of, denmark, southern, sweden, and, coastal, southern, norway, in, the, 18th, century, danish, philology, was, advanced, by, rasmus, rask,

nationalism, in, denmark, coinciding, with, the, so, called, golden, age, of, danish, culture, authors, such, as, n, f, s, grundtvig, emphasized, the, role, of, language, in, creating, national, belonging, some, of, the, most, cherished, danish, language, authors, of, this, period, are, existential, philosopher, s, ren, kierkegaard, and, prolific, fairy, tale, author, hans, christian, andersen, the, influence, of, popular, literary, role, models, together, with, increased, requirements, of, education, did, much, to, strengthen, the, danish, language, and, also, started, a, period, of, homogenization, whereby, the, copenhagen, standard, language, gradually, displaced, the, regional, vernacular, languages, throughout, the, 19th, century, danes, emigrated, establishing, small, expatriate, communities, in, the, americas, particularly, in, the, united, states, canada, and, argentina, where, memory, and, some, use, of, danish, remains, today, after, the, schleswig, referendum, in, 1920, a, number, of, danes, remained, as, a, minority, within, german, territories, after, the, occupation, of, denmark, by, germany, in, world, war, ii, the, 1948, orthography, reform, dropped,

regional, pronunciation, variation, of, the, standard, language, sometimes, called, regionssprog, regional, languages, remain, and, are, in, some, cases, vital, today, the, major, varieties, of, standard, danish, are, high, copenhagen, standard, associated, with, elderly, well, to, do, and, well, educated, people, of, the, capital, and, low, copenhagen, speech, traditionally, associated, with, the, working, class, but, today, adopted, as, the, prestige, variety, of, the, younger, generations, also, in, the, 21st, century, the, influence, of, immigration, has, had, linguistic, consequences, such, as, the, emergence, of, a, so, called, multiethnolect, in, the, urban, areas, an, immigrant, danish, variety, also, known, as, perkerdansk, combining, elements, of, different, immigrant, languages, such, as, arabic, turkish, and, kurdish, as, well, as, english, and, danish, within, the, danish, realm, danish, is, the, national, language, of, denmark, and, one, of, two, official, languages, of, the, faroe, islands, alongside, faroese, there, is, a, faroese, variant, of, danish, known, as, g, tudanskt, until, 2009, danish, was, also, one, of, two, official, languages, of, greenland, alongside, greenlandic, danish, now, acts, as, a, lingua, franca, in, greenland, with, a, large, percentage, of, native, greenlanders, able, to, speak, danish, as, a, second, language, it, was, introduced, into, the, education, system, as, a, compulsory, language, in, 1928, about, 10, of, the, population, speaks, danish, as, their, first, language, due, to, immigration, iceland, was, a, territory, ruled, by, denmark, norway, one, of, whose, official, languages, was, danish, though, danish, ceased, to, be, an, official, language, in, iceland, in, 1944, it, is, still, widely, used, and, is, a, mandatory, subject, in, school, taught, as, a, second, foreign, language, after, english, no, law, stipulates, an, official, language, for, denmark, making, danish, the, de, facto, official, language, only, the, code, of, civil, procedure, does, however, lay, down, danish, as, the, language, of, the, courts, since, 1997, public, authorities, have, been, obliged, to, follow, the, official, spelling, system, laid, out, in, the, orthography, law, in, the, 21st, century, discussions, have, been, held, with, a, view, to, create, a, law, that, would, make, danish, the, official, language, of, denmark, in, addition, a, noticeable, community, of, danish, speakers, is, in, southern, schleswig, the, portion, of, germany, bordering, denmark, and, a, variant, of, standard, danish, southern, schleswig, danish, is, spoken, in, the, area, since, 2015, schleswig, holstein, has, officially, recognized, danish, as, a, regional, language, just, as, german, is, north, of, the, border, furthermore, danish, is, one, of, the, official, languages, of, the, european, union, and, one, of, the, working, languages, of, the, nordic, council, under, the, nordic, language, convention, danish, speaking, citizens, of, the, nordic, countries, have, the, opportunity, to, use, their, native, language, when, interacting, with, official, bodies, in, other, nordic, countries, without, being, liable, for, any, interpretation, or, translation, costs, the, more, widespread, of, the, two, varieties, of, written, norwegian, bokm, l, is, very, close, to, danish, because, standard, danish, was, used, as, the, de, facto, administrative, language, until, 1814, and, one, of, the, official, languages, of, denmark, norway, bokm, l, is, based, on, danish, unlike, the, other, variety, of, norwegian, nynorsk, which, is, based, on, the, norwegian, dialects, with, old, norwegian, as, an, important, reference, point, also, north, frisian, and, gutnish, gutam, l, were, influenced, by, danish, there, are, also, danish, emigrant, communities, in, other, places, of, the, world, who, still, use, the, language, in, some, form, in, the, americas, danish, speaking, communities, can, be, found, in, the, us, canada, argentina, and, brazil, standard, danish, rigsdansk, is, the, language, based, on, dialects, spoken, in, and, around, the, capital, copenhagen, unlike, swedish, and, norwegian, danish, does, not, have, more, than, one, regional, speech, norm, more, than, 25, of, all, danish, speakers, live, in, the, metropolitan, area, of, the, capital, and, most, government, agencies, institutions, and, major, businesses, keep, their, main, offices, in, copenhagen, which, has, resulted, in, a, very, homogeneous, national, speech, norm, danish, dialects, can, be, divided, into, the, traditional, dialects, which, differ, from, modern, standard, danish, in, both, phonology, and, grammar, and, the, danish, accents, or, regional, languages, which, are, local, varieties, of, the, standard, language, distinguished, mostly, by, pronunciation, and, local, vocabulary, colored, by, traditional, dialects, traditional, dialects, are, now, mostly, extinct, in, denmark, with, only, the, oldest, generations, still, speaking, them, danish, traditional, dialects, are, divided, into, three, main, dialect, areas, jutlandic, is, further, divided, into, southern, jutlandic, and, northern, jutlandic, with, northern, jutlandic, subdivided, into, north, jutlandic, and, west, jutlandic, insular, danish, is, divided, into, zealand, funen, m, n, and, lolland, falster, dialect, areas, each, with, additional, internal, variation, bornholmian, is, the, only, eastern, danish, dialect, spoken, in, denmark, since, the, swedish, conquest, of, the, eastern, danish, provinces, sk, ne, halland, and, blekinge, in, 1645, 1658, the, eastern, danish, dialects, there, have, come, under, heavy, swedish, influence, many, residents, now, speak, regional, variants, of, standard, swedish, however, many, researchers, still, consider, the, dialects, in, scania, halland, hallandsk, and, blekinge, blekingsk, as, part, of, the, east, danish, dialect, group, the, swedish, national, encyclopedia, from, 1995, classifies, scanian, as, an, eastern, danish, dialect, with, south, swedish, elements, traditional, dialects, differ, in, phonology, grammar, and, vocabulary, from, standard, danish, phonologically, one, of, the, most, diagnostic, differences, is, the, presence, or, absence, of, st, d, four, main, regional, variants, for, the, realization, of, st, d, are, known, in, southeastern, jutlandic, southernmost, funen, southern, langeland, and, r, no, st, d, is, used, but, instead, a, pitch, accent, like, in, norwegian, swedish, and, gutnish, south, of, a, line, st, dgr, nsen, the, st, d, border, going, through, central, south, jutland, crossing, southern, funen, and, central, langeland, and, north, of, lolland, falster, m, n, southern, zealand, and, bornholm, neither, st, d, nor, pitch, accent, exists, most, of, jutland, and, on, zealand, use, st, d, and, in, zealandic, traditional, dialects, and, regional, language, st, d, occurs, more, often, than, in, the, standard, language, in, zealand, the, st, d, line, divides, southern, zealand, without, st, d, an, area, which, used, to, be, directly, under, the, crown, from, the, rest, of, the, island, that, used, to, be, the, property, of, various, noble, estates, grammatically, a, dialectally, significant, feature, is, the, number, of, grammatical, genders, standard, danish, has, two, genders, and, the, definite, form, of, nouns, is, formed, by, the, use, of, suffixes, while, western, jutlandic, has, only, one, gender, and, the, definite, form, of, nouns, uses, an, article, before, the, noun, itself, in, the, same, fashion, as, west, germanic, languages, the, bornholmian, dialect, has, maintained, to, this, day, many, archaic, features, such, as, a, distinction, between, three, grammatical, genders, insular, danish, traditional, dialects, also, conserved, three, grammatical, genders, by, 1900, zealand, insular, dialects, had, been, reduced, to, two, genders, under, influence, from, the, standard, language, but, other, insular, varieties, such, as, funen, dialect, had, not, besides, using, three, genders, the, old, insular, or, funen, dialect, could, also, use, personal, pronouns, like, he, and, she, in, certain, cases, particularly, referring, to, animals, a, classic, example, in, traditional, funen, dialect, is, the, sentence, katti, han, f, r, unger, literally, the, cat, he, is, having, kittens, because, cat, is, a, masculine, noun, thus, is, referred, to, as, han, he, even, if, it, is, a, female, cat, the, sound, system, of, danish, is, unusual, particularly, in, its, large, vowel, inventory, and, in, the, unusual, prosody, in, informal, or, rapid, speech, the, language, is, prone, to, considerable, reduction, of, unstressed, syllables, creating, many, vowel, less, syllables, with, syllabic, consonants, as, well, as, reduction, of, final, consonants, furthermore, the, language, s, prosody, does, not, include, many, clues, about, the, sentence, structure, unlike, many, other, languages, making, it, relatively, more, difficult, to, perceive, the, different, sounds, of, the, speech, flow, these, factors, taken, together, make, danish, pronunciation, difficult, to, master, for, learners, and, research, shows, danish, children, take, slightly, longer, in, learning, to, segment, speech, in, early, childhood, although, somewhat, depending, on, analysis, most, modern, variants, of, danish, distinguish, 12, long, vowels, 13, short, vowels, and, two, central, vowels, and, which, only, occur, in, unstressed, syllables, this, gives, a, total, of, 27, different, vowel, phonemes, a, very, large, number, among, the, world, s, languages, at, least, 19, different, diphthongs, also, occur, all, with, a, short, first, vowel, and, the, second, segment, being, either, or, the, table, below, shows, the, approximate, distribution, of, the, vowels, as, given, by, gr, nnum, 1998a, in, modern, standard, danish, with, the, symbols, used, in, ipa, danish, questions, of, analysis, may, give, a, slightly, different, inventory, for, example, based, on, whether, r, colored, vowels, are, considered, distinct, phonemes, basb, ll, 2005, 50, gives, 25, full, vowels, not, counting, the, two, unstressed, schwa, vowels, the, consonant, inventory, is, comparatively, simple, basb, ll, 2005, 73, distinguishes, 17, non, syllabic, consonant, phonemes, in, danish, many, of, these, phonemes, have, quite, different, allophones, in, onset, and, coda, where, intervocalic, consonants, followed, by, a, full, vowel, are, treated, as, in, onset, otherwise, as, in, coda, phonetically, there, is, no, voicing, distinction, among, the, stops, rather, the, distinction, is, one, of, aspiration, p, t, k, are, aspirated, in, onset, realized, as, but, not, in, coda, the, pronunciation, of, t, is, in, between, a, simple, aspirated, and, a, fully, affricated, as, has, happened, in, german, with, the, second, high, german, consonant, shift, from, t, to, z, there, is, dialectal, variation, and, some, jutlandic, dialects, may, be, less, affricated, than, other, varieties, with, northern, and, western, jutlandic, traditional, dialects, having, an, almost, unaspirated, dry, t, v, is, pronounced, as, a, in, syllable, coda, so, e, g, ra, v, grave, is, pronounced, often, have, slight, frication, but, are, usually, pronounced, as, approximants, danish, differs, from, the, english, sound, that, is, conventionally, transcribed, with, the, same, ipa, symbol, in, that, it, is, not, a, dental, fricative, but, an, alveolar, approximant, which, is, frequently, heard, as, by, second, language, learners, the, sound, is, found, for, example, in, the, word, sjov, fun, pronounced, and, tjal, marijuana, pronounced, some, analyses, have, posited, it, as, a, phoneme, but, since, it, occurs, only, after, s, or, t, and, does, not, occur, after, these, phonemes, it, can, be, analyzed, as, an, allophone, of, j, which, is, devoiced, after, voiceless, alveolar, frication, this, makes, it, unnecessary, to, postulate, a, phoneme, in, danish, jutlandic, dialects, often, lack, the, sound, and, pronounce, the, sj, cluster, as, or, in, onset, r, is, realized, as, a, uvular, pharyngeal, approximant, but, in, coda, it, is, either, realized, as, a, non, syllabic, low, central, vowel, or, simply, coalesces, with, the, preceding, vowel, the, phenomenon, is, comparable, to, the, r, in, german, or, in, non, rhotic, pronunciations, of, english, the, danish, realization, of, r, as, guttural, the, so, called, skarre, r, distinguishes, the, language, from, those, varieties, of, norwegian, and, swedish, that, use, trilled, only, very, few, middle, aged, or, elderly, speakers, of, jutlandic, retain, a, frontal, r, which, is, then, usually, realised, as, a, flapped, or, approximant, danish, is, characterized, by, a, prosodic, feature, called, st, d, lit, thrust, this, is, a, form, of, laryngealization, or, creaky, voice, some, sources, have, described, it, as, a, glottal, stop, but, this, is, a, very, infrequent, realization, and, today, phoneticians, consider, it, a, phonation, type, or, a, prosodic, phenomenon, the, occurrence, is, also, dependent, on, stress, and, some, varieties, also, realize, it, primarily, as, a, tone, the, st, d, has, phonemic, status, since, it, serves, as, the, sole, distinguishing, feature, of, words, with, different, meanings, in, minimal, pairs, such, as, b, nder, peasants, with, st, d, versus, b, nner, beans, without, st, d, the, distribution, of, st, d, in, the, vocabulary, is, related, to, the, distribution, of, the, common, scandinavian, pitch, accents, found, in, most, dialects, of, norwegian, and, swedish, stress, is, phonemic, and, distinguishes, words, such, as, billigst, bilisd, cheapest, and, bilist, bi, lisd, car, driver, intonation, reflects, the, stress, group, sentence, type, and, prosodic, phrase, in, copenhagen, standard, danish, the, pitch, pattern, reaches, its, lowest, peak, within, the, stress, group, on, the, stressed, syllable, followed, by, its, highest, peak, on, the, following, unstressed, syllable, after, which, it, declines, gradually, until, the, next, stress, group, in, interaction, pitch, can, mark, e, g, the, end, of, a, story, and, turn, taking, similarly, to, the, case, of, english, modern, danish, grammar, is, the, result, of, a, gradual, change, from, a, typical, indo, european, dependent, marking, pattern, with, a, rich, inflectional, morphology, and, relatively, free, word, order, to, a, mostly, analytic, pattern, with, little, inflection, a, fairly, fixed, svo, word, order, and, a, complex, syntax, some, traits, typical, of, germanic, languages, persist, in, danish, such, as, the, distinction, between, irregularly, inflected, strong, stems, inflected, through, ablaut, or, umlaut, i, e, changing, the, vowel, of, the, stem, as, in, the, pairs, tager, tog, takes, took, and, fod, f, dder, foot, feet, and, weak, stems, inflected, through, affixation, such, as, elsker, elskede, love, loved, bil, biler, car, cars, vestiges, of, the, germanic, case, and, gender, system, are, found, in, the, pronoun, system, typical, for, an, indo, european, language, danish, follows, accusative, morphosyntactic, alignment, danish, distinguishes, at, least, seven, major, word, classes, verbs, nouns, numerals, adjectives, adverbs, articles, prepositions, conjunctions, interjections, and, onomatopoeia, nouns, are, inflected, for, number, singular, vs, plural, and, definiteness, and, are, classified, into, two, grammatical, genders, only, pronouns, inflect, for, case, and, the, previous, genitive, case, has, become, an, enclitic, a, distinctive, feature, of, the, nordic, languages, including, danish, is, that, the, definite, articles, which, also, mark, noun, gender, have, developed, into, suffixes, typical, of, germanic, languages, plurals, are, either, irregular, or, strong, stems, inflected, through, umlaut, i, e, changing, the, vowel, of, the, stem, e, g, fod, f, dder, foot, feet, mand, m, nd, man, men, or, weak, stems, inflected, through, affixation, e, g, skib, skibe, ship, ships, kvinde, kvinder, woman, women, standard, danish, has, two, nominal, genders, common, and, neuter, the, common, gender, arose, as, the, historical, feminine, and, masculine, genders, conflated, into, a, single, category, some, traditional, dialects, retain, a, three, way, gender, distinction, between, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, and, some, dialects, of, jutland, have, a, masculine, feminine, contrast, while, the, majority, of, danish, nouns, ca, 75, have, the, common, gender, and, neuter, is, often, used, for, inanimate, objects, the, genders, of, nouns, are, not, generally, predictable, and, must, in, most, cases, be, memorized, the, gender, of, a, noun, determines, the, form, of, adjectives, that, modify, it, and, the, form, of, the, definite, suffixes, definiteness, is, marked, by, two, mutually, exclusive, articles, either, a, postposed, enclitic, or, a, preposed, article, which, is, the, obligatory, way, to, mark, definiteness, when, nouns, are, modified, by, an, adjective, neuter, nouns, take, the, clitic, et, and, common, gender, nouns, take, en, indefinite, nouns, take, the, articles, en, common, gender, or, et, neuter, hence, the, common, gender, noun, en, mand, a, man, indefinite, has, the, definite, form, manden, the, man, whereas, the, neuter, noun, et, hus, a, house, indefinite, has, the, definite, form, the, house, definite, huset, indefinite, definite, with, enclitic, article, definite, with, preposed, demonstrative, article, the, plural, definite, ending, is, e, ne, e, g, drenge, boys, drengene, the, boys, and, piger, girls, pigerne, the, girls, and, nouns, ending, in, ere, lose, the, last, e, before, adding, the, ne, suffix, e, g, danskere, danes, danskerne, the, danes, when, the, noun, is, modified, by, an, adjective, the, definiteness, is, marked, by, the, definite, article, den, common, or, det, neuter, and, the, definite, plural, form, of, the, adjective, den, store, mand, the, big, man, det, store, hus, the, big, house, there, are, three, different, types, of, regular, plurals, class, 1, forms, the, plural, with, the, suffix, er, indefinite, and, erne, definite, class, 2, with, the, suffix, e, indefinite, and, ene, definite, and, class, 3, takes, no, suffix, for, the, plural, indefinite, form, and, ene, for, the, plural, definite, most, irregular, nouns, have, an, ablaut, plural, i, e, with, a, change, in, the, stem, vowel, or, combine, ablaut, stem, change, with, the, suffix, and, some, have, unique, plural, forms, unique, forms, may, be, inherited, e, g, the, plural, of, je, eye, which, is, the, old, dual, form, jne, or, for, loan, words, they, may, be, borrowed, from, the, donor, language, e, g, the, word, konto, account, which, is, borrowed, from, italian, and, uses, the, italian, masculine, plural, form, konti, accounts, possessive, phrases, are, formed, with, the, enclitic, s, for, example, min, fars, hus, my, father, s, house, where, the, noun, far, carries, the, possessive, enclitic, this, is, however, not, an, example, of, genitive, case, marking, because, in, the, case, of, longer, noun, phrases, the, s, attaches, to, the, last, word, in, the, phrase, which, need, not, be, the, head, noun, or, even, a, noun, at, all, for, example, the, phrases, kongen, af, danmarks, bolsjefabrik, the, king, of, denmark, s, candy, factory, where, the, factory, is, owned, by, the, king, of, denmark, or, det, er, pigen, uffe, bor, sammen, meds, datter, that, is, the, daughter, of, the, girl, that, uffe, lives, with, where, the, enclitic, attaches, to, a, stranded, preposition, like, all, germanic, languages, danish, forms, compound, nouns, these, are, represented, in, danish, orthography, as, one, word, as, in, kvindeh, ndboldlandsholdet, the, female, national, handball, team, in, some, cases, nouns, are, joined, with, s, as, a, linking, element, originally, possessive, in, function, like, landsmand, from, land, country, and, mand, man, meaning, compatriot, but, landmand, from, same, roots, meaning, farmer, some, words, are, joined, with, the, linking, element, e, instead, like, g, stebog, from, g, st, and, bog, meaning, guest, book, there, are, also, irregular, linking, elements, as, does, english, the, danish, pronominal, system, retains, a, distinction, between, nominative, and, oblique, case, the, nominative, form, of, pronouns, is, used, when, pronouns, occur, as, grammatical, subject, of, a, sentence, and, only, when, non, coordinated, and, without, a, following, modifier, and, oblique, forms, are, used, for, all, non, subject, functions, including, direct, and, indirect, object, predicative, comparative, and, other, types, of, constructions, the, third, person, singular, pronouns, also, distinguish, between, animate, masculine, han, he, animate, feminine, hun, she, forms, as, well, as, inanimate, neuter, det, it, and, inanimate, common, gender, den, it, possessive, pronouns, have, independent, and, adjectival, uses, but, the, same, form, the, form, is, used, both, adjectivally, preceding, a, possessed, noun, det, er, min, hest, it, is, my, horse, and, independently, in, place, of, the, possessed, noun, den, er, min, it, is, mine, in, the, third, person, singular, sin, is, used, when, the, possessor, is, also, the, subject, of, the, sentence, whereas, hans, his, hendes, her, and, dens, dets, its, is, used, when, the, possessor, is, different, from, the, grammatical, subject, danish, verbs, are, morphologically, simple, marking, very, few, grammatical, categories, they, do, not, mark, person, or, number, of, subject, although, the, marking, of, plural, subjects, was, still, used, in, writing, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, verbs, have, a, past, non, past, and, infinitive, form, past, and, present, participle, forms, and, a, passive, and, an, imperative, verbs, can, be, divided, into, two, main, classes, the, strong, irregular, verbs, and, the, regular, weak, verbs, the, regular, verbs, are, also, divided, into, two, classes, those, that, take, the, past, suffix, te, and, those, that, take, the, suffix, ede, the, infinitive, always, ends, in, a, vowel, usually, e, pronounced, infinitive, forms, are, preceded, by, the, article, at, pronounced, in, some, syntactic, functions, the, non, past, or, present, tense, takes, the, suffix, r, except, for, a, few, strong, verbs, that, have, irregular, non, past, forms, the, past, form, does, not, necessarily, mark, past, tense, but, also, counterfactuality, or, conditionality, and, the, non, past, has, many, uses, besides, present, tense, time, reference, the, present, participle, ends, in, ende, e, g, l, bende, running, and, the, past, participle, ends, in, et, e, g, l, bet, run, t, e, g, k, bt, bought, the, perfect, is, constructed, with, at, have, to, have, and, participial, forms, like, in, english, but, some, transitive, verbs, form, the, perfect, using, at, v, re, to, be, instead, and, some, may, use, both, with, a, difference, in, meaning, the, passive, form, takes, the, suffix, s, avisen, l, ses, hver, dag, the, newspaper, is, read, every, day, another, passive, construction, uses, the, auxiliary, verb, at, blive, to, become, avisen, bliver, l, st, hver, dag, the, imperative, form, is, the, infinitive, without, the, final, schwa, vowel, with, st, d, potentially, being, applied, depending, on, syllable, structure, certain, numerals, are, formed, on, the, basis, of, a, vigesimal, system, with, various, rules, in, the, word, forms, of, numbers, above, 20, the, units, are, stated, before, the, tens, so, 21, is, rendered, enogtyve, literally, one, and, twenty, the, numeral, halvanden, means, 1, 1, 2, literally, half, second, implying, one, plus, half, of, the, second, one, the, numerals, halvtredje, 2, 1, 2, halvfjerde, 3, 1, 2, and, halvfemte, 4, 1, 2, are, obsolete, but, still, implicitly, used, in, the, vigesimal, system, described, below, similarly, the, temporal, designation, klokken, halv, tre, literally, half, three, o, clock, is, half, past, two, one, peculiar, feature, of, the, danish, language, is, that, the, numerals, 50, 60, 70, 80, and, 90, are, as, are, the, french, numerals, from, 80, through, 99, based, on, a, vigesimal, system, meaning, that, the, score, 20, is, used, as, a, base, unit, in, counting, tres, short, for, tre, sinds, tyve, three, times, twenty, means, 60, while, 50, is, halvtreds, short, for, halvtredje, sinds, tyve, half, third, times, twenty, implying, two, score, plus, half, of, the, third, score, the, ending, sindstyve, meaning, times, twenty, is, no, longer, included, in, cardinal, numbers, but, may, still, be, used, in, ordinal, numbers, thus, in, modern, danish, fifty, two, is, usually, rendered, as, tooghalvtreds, from, the, now, obsolete, tooghalvtredsindstyve, whereas, 52nd, is, either, tooghalvtredsende, or, tooghalvtredsindstyvende, twenty, is, tyve, derived, from, old, danish, tiughu, old, norse, form, tuttugu, meaning, two, tens, while, thirty, is, tredive, old, danish, rjatiughu, three, tens, and, forty, is, fyrre, old, danish, fyritiughu, four, tens, still, used, today, as, the, archaism, fyrretyve, thus, the, suffix, tyve, should, be, understood, as, a, plural, of, ti, 10, though, to, modern, danes, tyve, means, 20, making, it, hard, to, explain, why, fyrretyve, is, 40, four, tens, and, not, 80, four, twenties, for, large, numbers, one, billion, or, larger, danish, uses, the, long, scale, so, that, the, short, scale, billion, 1, 000, 000, 000, is, called, milliard, and, the, short, scale, trillion, 1, 000, 000, 000, 000, is, billion, danish, basic, constituent, order, in, simple, sentences, with, both, a, subject, and, an, object, is, subject, verb, object, however, danish, is, also, a, v2, language, which, means, that, the, verb, must, always, be, the, second, constituent, of, the, sentence, following, the, danish, grammarian, paul, diderichsen, danish, grammar, tends, to, be, analyzed, as, consisting, of, slots, or, fields, and, in, which, certain, types, of, sentence, material, can, be, moved, to, the, pre, verbal, or, foundation, field, to, achieve, different, pragmatic, effects, usually, the, sentence, material, occupying, the, preverbal, slot, has, to, be, pragmatically, marked, usually, either, new, information, or, topics, there, is, no, rule, that, subjects, must, occur, in, the, preverbal, slot, but, since, subject, and, topic, often, coincide, they, often, do, therefore, whenever, any, sentence, material, that, is, not, the, subject, occurs, in, the, preverbal, position, the, subject, is, demoted, to, postverbal, position, and, the, sentence, order, becomes, vso, but, when, there, is, no, pragmatically, marked, constituents, in, the, sentence, to, take, the, preverbal, slot, for, example, when, all, the, information, is, new, the, slot, has, to, take, a, dummy, subject, der, haberland, 1994, p, 336, describes, the, basic, order, of, sentence, constituents, in, main, clauses, as, comprising, the, following, 8, positions, position, 0, is, not, part, of, the, sentence, and, can, only, contain, sentential, connectors, such, as, conjunctions, or, interjections, position, 1, can, contain, any, sentence, constituent, position, 2, can, only, contain, the, finite, verb, position, 3, is, the, subject, position, unless, the, subject, is, fronted, to, occur, in, position, 1, position, 4, can, only, contain, light, adverbs, and, the, negation, position, 5, is, for, non, finite, verbs, such, as, auxiliaries, position, 6, is, the, position, of, direct, and, indirect, objects, and, position, 7, is, for, heavy, adverbial, constituents, questions, with, wh, words, are, formed, differently, from, yes, no, questions, in, wh, questions, the, question, word, occupies, the, preverbal, field, regardless, of, whether, its, grammatical, role, is, subject, or, object, or, adverbial, in, yes, no, questions, the, preverbal, field, is, empty, so, that, the, sentence, begins, with, the, verb, wh, question, in, subordinate, clauses, the, word, order, differs, from, that, of, main, clauses, in, the, subordinate, clause, structure, the, verb, is, preceded, by, the, subject, and, any, light, adverbial, material, e, g, negation, complement, clauses, begin, with, the, particle, at, in, the, connector, field, relative, clauses, are, marked, by, the, relative, pronouns, som, or, der, which, occupy, the, preverbal, slot, the, oldest, preserved, examples, of, written, danish, from, the, iron, and, viking, ages, are, in, the, runic, alphabet, the, introduction, of, christianity, also, brought, the, latin, script, to, denmark, and, at, the, end, of, the, high, middle, ages, runes, had, more, or, less, been, replaced, by, latin, letters, danish, orthography, is, conservative, using, most, of, the, conventions, established, in, the, 16th, century, the, spoken, language, however, has, changed, a, lot, since, then, creating, a, gap, between, the, spoken, and, written, languages, since, 1955, dansk, sprogn, vn, has, been, the, official, language, council, in, denmark, the, modern, danish, alphabet, is, similar, to, the, english, one, with, three, additional, letters, and, which, come, at, the, end, of, the, alphabet, in, that, order, the, letters, c, q, w, x, and, z, are, only, used, in, loan, words, a, spelling, reform, in, 1948, introduced, the, letter, already, in, use, in, norwegian, and, swedish, into, the, danish, alphabet, to, replace, the, digraph, aa, the, old, usage, continues, to, occur, in, some, personal, and, geographical, names, for, example, the, name, of, the, city, of, aalborg, is, spelled, with, aa, following, a, decision, by, the, city, council, in, the, 1970s, and, aarhus, decided, to, go, back, to, aa, in, 2011, when, representing, the, same, sound, aa, is, treated, like, in, alphabetical, sorting, though, it, appears, to, be, two, letters, when, the, letters, are, not, available, due, to, technical, limitations, they, are, often, replaced, by, ae, for, oe, or, o, for, and, aa, for, respectively, the, same, spelling, reform, changed, the, spelling, of, a, few, common, words, such, as, the, past, tense, vilde, would, kunde, could, and, skulde, should, to, their, current, forms, of, ville, kunne, and, skulle, making, them, identical, to, the, infinitives, in, writing, as, they, are, in, speech, modern, danish, and, norwegian, use, the, same, alphabet, though, spelling, differs, slightly, particularly, with, the, phonetic, spelling, of, loanwords, for, example, the, spelling, of, station, and, garage, in, danish, remains, identical, to, other, languages, whereas, in, norwegian, they, are, transliterated, as, stasjon, and, garasje, danish, is, a, well, studied, language, and, multiple, universities, in,
