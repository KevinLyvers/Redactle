facts, to, encourage, a, particular, synthesis, or, perception, or, using, loaded, language, to, produce, an, emotional, rather, than, a, rational, response, to, the, information, that, is, being, presented, propaganda, can, be, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, different, contexts, beginning, in, the, twentieth, century, the, english, term, propaganda, became, associated, with, a, manipulative, approach, but, historically, propaganda, had, been, a, neutral, descriptive, term, of, any, material, that, promotes, certain, opinions, or, ideologies, a, wide, range, of, materials, and, media, are, used, for, conveying, propaganda, messages, which, changed, as, new, technologies, were, invented, including, paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio, shows, tv, shows, and, websites, more, recently, the, digital, age, has, given, rise, to, new, ways, of, disseminating, propaganda, for, example, bots, and, algorithms, are, currently, being, used, to, create, computational, propaganda, and, fake, or, biased, news, and, spread, it, on, social, media, propaganda, is, a, modern, latin, word, the, neuter, plural, gerundive, form, of, propagare, meaning, to, spread, or, to, propagate, thus, propaganda, means, the, things, which, are, to, be, propagated, originally, this, word, derived, from, a, new, administrative, body, congregation, of, the, catholic, church, created, in, 1622, as, part, of, the, counter, reformation, called, the, congregatio, de, propaganda, fide, congregation, for, propagating, the, faith, or, informally, simply, propaganda, its, activity, was, aimed, at, propagating, the, catholic, faith, in, non, catholic, countries, from, the, 1790s, the, term, began, being, used, also, to, refer, to, propaganda, in, secular, activities, in, english, the, cognate, began, taking, a, pejorative, or, negative, connotation, in, the, mid, 19th, century, when, it, was, used, in, the, political, sphere, non, english, cognates, of, propaganda, as, well, as, some, similar, non, english, terms, retain, neutral, or, positive, connotations, for, example, in, official, party, discourse, xuanchuan, is, treated, as, a, more, neutral, or, positive, term, though, it, can, be, used, pejoratively, through, protest, or, other, informal, settings, within, china, 4, 6, historian, arthur, aspinall, observed, that, newspapers, were, not, expected, to, be, independent, organs, of, information, when, they, began, to, play, an, important, part, in, political, life, in, the, late, 1700s, but, were, assumed, to, promote, the, views, of, their, owners, or, government, sponsors, in, the, 20th, century, the, term, propaganda, emerged, along, with, the, rise, of, mass, media, including, newspapers, and, radio, as, researchers, began, studying, the, effects, of, media, they, used, suggestion, theory, to, explain, how, people, could, be, influenced, by, emotionally, resonant, persuasive, messages, harold, lasswell, provided, a, broad, definition, of, the, term, propaganda, writing, it, as, the, expression, of, opinions, or, actions, carried, out, deliberately, by, individuals, or, groups, with, a, view, to, influencing, the, opinions, or, actions, of, other, individuals, or, groups, for, predetermined, ends, and, through, psychological, manipulations, garth, jowett, and, victoria, o, donnell, theorize, that, propaganda, and, persuasion, are, linked, as, humans, use, communication, as, a, form, of, soft, power, through, the, development, and, cultivation, of, propaganda, materials, in, a, 1929, literary, debate, with, edward, bernays, everett, dean, martin, argues, that, propaganda, is, making, puppets, of, us, we, are, moved, by, hidden, strings, which, the, propagandist, manipulates, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, propaganda, was, sometimes, described, as, all, powerful, for, example, bernays, acknowledged, in, his, book, propaganda, that, the, conscious, and, intelligent, manipulation, of, the, organized, habits, and, opinions, of, the, masses, is, an, important, element, in, democratic, society, those, who, manipulate, this, unseen, mechanism, of, society, constitute, an, invisible, government, which, is, the, true, ruling, power, of, our, country, we, are, governed, our, minds, are, molded, our, tastes, formed, our, ideas, suggested, largely, by, men, we, have, never, heard, of, nato, s, 2011,

of, any, specified, group, in, order, to, benefit, the, sponsor, either, directly, or, indirectly, primitive, forms, of, propaganda, have, been, a, human, activity, as, far, back, as, reliable, recorded, evidence, exists, the, behistun, inscription, c, 515, bce, detailing, the, rise, of, darius, i, to, the, persian, throne, is, viewed, by, most, historians, as, an, early, example, of, propaganda, another, striking, example, of, propaganda, during, ancient, history, is, the, last, roman, civil, wars, 44, 30, bce, during, which, octavian, and, mark, antony, blamed, each, other, for, obscure, and, degrading, origins, cruelty, cowardice, oratorical, and, literary, incompetence, debaucheries, luxury, drunkenness, and, other, slanders, this, defamation, took, the, form, of, uituperatio, roman, rhetorical, genre, of, the, invective, which, was, decisive, for, shaping, the, roman, public, opinion, at, this, time, another, early, example, of, propaganda, was, from, genghis, khan, the, emperor, would, send, some, of, his, men, ahead, of, his, army, to, spread, rumors, to, the, enemy, in, many, cases, his, army, was, actually, smaller, than, his, opponents, holy, roman,

population, of, his, empire, he, was, the, first, ruler, who, utilized, one, sided, battle, reports, the, early, predecessors, of, modern, newspapers, or, neue, zeitungen, targeting, the, mass, and, influence, the, population, of, his, enemies, propaganda, during, the, reformation, helped, by, the, spread, of, the, printing, press, throughout, europe, and, in, particular, within, germany, caused, new, ideas, thoughts, and, doctrine, to, be, made, available, to, the, public, in, ways, that, had, never, been, seen, before, the, 16th, century, during, the, era, of, the, american, revolution, the, american, colonies, had, a, flourishing, network, of, newspapers, and, printers, who, specialized, in, the, topic, on, behalf, of, the, patriots, and, to, a, lesser, extent, on, behalf, of, the, loyalists, academic, barbara, diggs, brown, conceives, that, the, negative, connotations, of, the, term, propaganda, are, associated, with, the, earlier, social, and, political, transformations, that, occurred, during, the, french, revolutionary, period, movement, of, 1789, to, 1799, between, the, start, and, the, middle, portion, of, the, 19th, century, in, a, time, where, the, word, started, to, be, used, in, a, nonclerical, and, political, context, the, first, large, scale, and, organised, propagation, of, government, propaganda, was, occasioned, by, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1914, after, the, defeat, of, germany, military, officials, such, as, general, erich, ludendorff, suggested, that, british, propaganda, had, been, instrumental, in, their, defeat, adolf, hitler, came, to, echo, this, view, believing, that, it, had, been, a, primary, cause, of, the, collapse, of, morale, and, revolts, in, the, german, home, front, and, navy, in, 1918, see, also, dolchsto, legende, in, mein, kampf, 1925, hitler, expounded, his, theory, of, propaganda, which, provided, a, powerful, base, for, his, rise, to, power, in, 1933, historian, robert, ensor, explains, that, hitler, puts, no, limit, on, what, can, be, done, by, propaganda, people, will, believe, anything, provided, they, are, told, it, often, enough, and, emphatically, enough, and, that, contradicters, are, either, silenced, or, smothered, in, calumny, this, was, to, be, true, in, germany, and, backed, up, with, their, army, making, it, difficult, to, allow, other, propaganda, to,

others, the, term, has, acquired, a, strong, negative, connotation, the, connotations, of, the, term, propaganda, can, also, vary, over, time, for, example, in, portuguese, and, some, spanish, language, speaking, countries, particularly, in, the, southern, cone, the, word, propaganda, usually, refers, to, the, most, common, manipulative, media, in, business, terms, advertising, in, english, propaganda, was, originally, a, neutral, term, for, the, dissemination, of, information, in, favor, of, any, given, cause, during, the, 20th, century, however, the, term, acquired, a, thoroughly,

ideologies, according, to, harold, lasswell, the, term, began, to, fall, out, of, favor, due, to, growing, public, suspicion, of, propaganda, in, the, wake, of, its, use, during, world, war, i, by,

lamentation, over, it, propaganda, has, become, an, epithet, of, contempt, and, hate, and, the, propagandists, have, sought, protective, coloration, in, such, names, as, public, relations, council,

euphemistic, synonyms, are, used, in, governments, continual, efforts, to, rebrand, their, operations, such, as, information, support, and, strategic, communication, other, scholars, also, see, benefits, to, acknowledging, that, propaganda, can, be, interpreted, as, beneficial, or, harmful, depending, on, the, message, sender, target, audience, message, and, context, david, goodman, argues, that, the, 1936, league, of, nations, convention, on, the, use, of, broadcasting, in, the, cause, of, peace, tried, to, create, the, standards, for, a, liberal, international, public, sphere, the, convention, encouraged, empathetic, and, neighborly, radio, broadcasts, to, other, nations, it, called, for, league, prohibitions, on, international, broadcast, containing, hostile, speech, and, false, claims, it, tried, to, define, the, line, between, liberal, and, illiberal, policies, in, communications, and, emphasized, the, dangers, of, nationalist, chauvinism, with, nazi, germany, and, soviet, russia, active, on, the, radio, its, liberal, goals, were, ignored, while, free, speech, advocates, warned, that, the, code, represented, restraints, on, free, speech, identifying, propaganda, has, always, been, a, problem, the, main, difficulties, have, involved, differentiating, propaganda, from, other, types, of, persuasion, and, avoiding, a, biased, approach, richard, alan, nelson, provides, a, definition, of, the, term, propaganda, is, neutrally, defined, as, a, systematic, form, of, purposeful, persuasion, that, attempts, to, influence, the, emotions, attitudes, opinions, and, actions, of, specified, target, audiences, for, ideological, political, or, commercial, purposes, through, the, controlled, transmission, of, one, sided, messages, which, may, or, may, not, be, factual, via, mass, and, direct, media, channels, the, definition, focuses, on, the, communicative, process, involved, or, more, precisely, on, the, purpose, of, the, process, and, allow, propaganda, to, be, interpreted, as, positive, or, negative, behavior, depending, on, the, perspective, of, the, viewer, or, listener, propaganda, can, often, be, recognized, by, the, rhetorical, strategies, used, in, its, design, in, the, 1930s, the, institute, for, propaganda, analysis, identified, a, variety, of, propaganda, techniques, that, were, commonly, used, in, newspapers, and, on, the, radio, which, were, the, mass, media, of, the, time, period, propaganda, techniques, include, name, calling, using, derogatory, labels, bandwagon, expressing, the, social, appeal, of, a, message, or, glittering, generalities, using, positive, but, imprecise, language, with, the, rise, of, the, internet, and, social, media, renee, hobbs, identified, four, characteristic, design, features, of, many, forms, of, contemporary, propaganda, 1, it, activates, strong, emotions, 2, it, simplifies, information, 3, it, appeals, to, the, hopes, fears, and, dreams, of, a, targeted, audience, and, 4, it, attacks, opponents, propaganda, is, sometimes, evaluated, based, on, the, intention, and, goals, of, the, individual, or, institution, who, created, it, according, to, historian, zbyn, k, zeman, propaganda, is, defined, as, either, white, grey, or, black, white, propaganda, openly, discloses, its, source, and, intent, grey, propaganda, has, an, ambiguous, or, non, disclosed, source, or, intent, black, propaganda, purports, to, be, published, by, the, enemy, or, some, organization, besides, its, actual, origins, compare, with, black, operation, a, type, of, clandestine, operation, in, which, the, identity, of, the, sponsoring, government, is, hidden, in, scale, these, different, types, of, propaganda, can, also, be, defined, by, the, potential, of, true, and, correct, information, to, compete, with, the, propaganda, for, example, opposition, to, white, propaganda, is, often, readily, found, and, may, slightly, discredit, the, propaganda, source, opposition, to, grey, propaganda, when, revealed, often, by, an, inside, source, may, create, some, level, of, public, outcry, opposition, to, black, propaganda, is, often, unavailable, and, may, be, dangerous, to, reveal, because, public, cognizance, of, black, propaganda, tactics, and, sources, would, undermine, or, backfire, the, very, campaign, the, black, propagandist, supported, the, propagandist, seeks, to, change, the, way, people, understand, an, issue, or, situation, for, the, purpose, of, changing, their, actions, and, expectations, in, ways, that, are, desirable, to, the, interest, group, propaganda, in, this, sense, serves, as, a, corollary, to, censorship, in, which, the, same, purpose, is, achieved, not, by, filling, people, s, minds, with, approved, information, but, by, preventing, people, from, being, confronted, with, opposing, points, of, view, what, sets, propaganda, apart, from, other, forms, of, advocacy, is, the, willingness, of, the, propagandist, to, change, people, s, understanding, through, deception, and, confusion, rather, than, persuasion, and, understanding, the, leaders, of, an, organization, know, the, information, to, be, one, sided, or, untrue, but, this, may, not, be, true, for, the, rank, and, file, members, who, help, to, disseminate, the, propaganda, propaganda, was, often, used, to, influence, opinions, and, beliefs, on, religious, issues, particularly, during, the, split, between, the, roman, catholic, church, and, the, protestant, churches, or, during, the, crusades, the, sociologist, jeffrey, k, hadden, has, argued, that, members, of, the, anti, cult, movement, and, christian, counter, cult, movement, accuse, the, leaders, of, what, they, consider, cults, of, using, propaganda, extensively, to, recruit, followers, and, keep, them, hadden, argued, that, ex, members, of, cults, and, the, anti, cult, movement, are, committed, to, making, these, movements, look, bad, propaganda, against, other, religions, in, the, same, community, or, propaganda, intended, to, keep, political, power, in, the, hands, of, a, religious, elite, can, incite, religious, hate, on, a, global, or, national, scale, it, could, make, use, of, many, propaganda, mediums, war, terrorism, riots, and, other, violent, acts, can, result, from, it, it, can, also, conceal, injustices, inequities, exploitation, and, atrocities, leading, to, ignorance, based, indifference, and, alienation, in, the, peloponnesian, war, the, athenians, exploited, the, figures, from, stories, about, troy, as, well, as, other, mythical, images, to, incite, feelings, against, sparta, for, example, helen, of, troy, was, even, portrayed, as, an, athenian, whose, mother, nemesis, would, avenge, troy, during, the, punic, wars, extensive, campaigns, of,

humanity, and, would, soon, lose, the, favour, of, gods, at, the, same, time, led, by, q, fabius, maximus, they, organized, elaborate, religious, rituals, to, protect, roman, morale, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, maximilian, i, invented, one, kind, of, psychological, warfare, targeting, the, enemies, during, his, war, against, venice, he, attached, pamphlets, to, balloons, that, his,

word, propaganda, more, typically, refers, to, political, or, nationalist, uses, of, these, techniques, or, to, the, promotion, of, a, set, of, ideas, propaganda, is, a, powerful, weapon, in, war, in, certain, cases, it, is, used, to, dehumanize, and, create, hatred, toward, a, supposed, enemy, either, internal, or, external, by, creating, a, false, image, in, the, mind, of, soldiers, and, citizens, this, can, be, done, by, using, derogatory, or, racist, terms, e, g, the, racist, terms, jap, and, gook, used, during, world, war, ii, and, the, vietnam, war, respectively, avoiding, some, words, or, language, or, by, making, allegations, of, enemy, atrocities, the, goal, of, this, was, to, demoralize, the, opponent, into, thinking, what, was, being, projected, was, actually, true, most, propaganda, efforts, in, wartime, require, the, home, population, to, feel, the, enemy, has, inflicted, an, injustice, which, may, be, fictitious, or, may, be, based, on, facts, e, g, the, sinking, of, the, passenger, ship, rms, lusitania, by, the, german, navy, in, world, war, i, the, home, population, must, also, believe, that, the, cause, of, their, nation, in, the, war, is, just, in, these, efforts, it, was, difficult, to, determine, the, accuracy, of, how, propaganda, truly, impacted, the, war, in, nato, doctrine, propaganda, is, defined, as, information, especially, of, a, biased, or, misleading, nature, used, to, promote, a, political, cause, or, point, of, view, within, this, perspective, the, information, provided, does, not, need, to, be, necessarily, false, but, must, be, instead, relevant, to, specific, goals, of, the, actor, or, system, that, performs, it, propaganda, is, also, one, of, the, methods, used, in, psychological, warfare, which, may, also, involve, false, flag, operations, in, which, the, identity, of, the, operatives, is, depicted, as, those, of, an, enemy, nation, e, g, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, used, cia, planes, painted, in, cuban, air, force, markings, the, term, propaganda, may, also, refer, to, false, information, meant, to, reinforce, the, mindsets, of, people, who, already, believe, as, the, propagandist, wishes, e,

were, used, because, regular, general, radio, broadcasting, was, yet, to, commence, and, tv, technology, was, still, under, development, the, assumption, is, that, if, people, believe, something, false, they, will, constantly, be, assailed, by, doubts, since, these, doubts, are, unpleasant, see, cognitive, dissonance, people, will, be, eager, to, have, them, extinguished, and, are, therefore, receptive, to, the, reassurances, of, those, in, power, for, this, reason, propaganda, is, often, addressed, to, people, who, are, already, sympathetic, to, the, agenda, or, views, being, presented, this, process, of, reinforcement, uses, an, individual, s, predisposition, to, self, select, agreeable, information, sources, as, a, mechanism, for, maintaining, control, over, populations, propaganda, may, be, administered, in, insidious, ways, for, instance, disparaging, disinformation, about, the, history, of, certain, groups, or, foreign, countries, may, be, encouraged, or, tolerated, in, the, educational, system, since, few, people, actually, double, check, what, they, learn, at, school, such, disinformation, will, be, repeated, by, journalists, as, well, as, parents, thus, reinforcing, the, idea, that, the, disinformation, item, is, really, a, well, known, fact, even, though, no, one, repeating, the, myth, is, able, to, point, to, an, authoritative, source, the, disinformation, is, then, recycled, in, the, media, and, in, the, educational, system, without, the, need, for, direct, governmental, intervention, on, the, media, such, permeating, propaganda, may, be, used, for, political, goals, by, giving, citizens, a, false, impression, of, the, quality, or, policies, of, their, country, they, may, be, incited, to, reject, certain, proposals, or, certain, remarks, or, ignore, the, experience, of, others, in, the, soviet, union, during, the, second, world, war, the, propaganda, designed, to, encourage, civilians, was, controlled, by, stalin, who, insisted, on, a, heavy, handed, style, that, educated, audiences, easily, saw, was, inauthentic, on, the, other, hand, the, unofficial, rumors, about, german, atrocities, were, well, founded, and, convincing, stalin, was, a, georgian, who, spoke, russian, with, a, heavy, accent, that, would, not, do, for, a, national, hero, so, starting, in, the, 1930s, all, new, visual, portraits, of, stalin, were, retouched, to, erase, his, georgian, facial, characteristics, and, make, him, a, more, generalized, soviet, hero, only, his, eyes, and, famous, moustache, remained, unaltered, zhores, medvedev, and, roy, medvedev, say, his, majestic, new, image, was, devised, appropriately, to, depict, the, leader, of, all, times, and, of, all, peoples, article, 20, of, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, prohibits, any, propaganda, for, war, as, well, as, any, advocacy, of, national, or, religious, hatred, that, constitutes, incitement, to, discrimination, hostility, or, violence, by, law, naturally, the, common, people, don, t, want, war, neither, in, russia, nor, in, england, nor, in, america, nor, for, that, matter, in, germany, that, is, understood, but, after, all, it, is, the, leaders, of, the, country, who, determine, the, policy, and, it, is, always, a, simple, matter, to, drag, the, people, along, whether, it, is, a, democracy, or, a, fascist, dictatorship, or, a, parliament, or, a, communist, dictatorship, the, people, can, always, be, brought, to, the, bidding, of, the, leaders, that, is, easy, all, you, have, to, do, is, tell, them, they, are, being, attacked, and, denounce, the, pacifists, for, lack, of, patriotism, and, exposing, the, country, to, danger, it, works, the, same, way, in, any, country, simply, enough, the, covenant, specifically, is, not, defining, the, content, of, propaganda, in, simplest, terms, an, act, of, propaganda, if, used, in, a, reply, to, a, wartime, act, is, not, prohibited, propaganda, shares, techniques, with, advertising, and, public, relations, each, of, which, can, be, thought, of, as, propaganda, that, promotes, a, commercial, product, or, shapes, the, perception, of, an, organization, person, or, brand, for, example, after, claiming, victory, in, the, 2006, lebanon, war, hezbollah, campaigned, for, broader, popularity, among, arabs, by, organizing, mass, rallies, where, hezbollah, leader, hassan, nasrallah, combined, elements, of, the, local, dialect, with, classical, arabic, to, reach, audiences, outside, lebanon, banners, and, billboards, were, commissioned, in, commemoration, of, the, war, along, with, various, merchandise, items, with, hezbollah, s, logo, flag, color, yellow, and, images, of, nasrallah, t, shirts, baseball, caps, and, other, war, memorabilia, were, marketed, for, all, ages, the, uniformity, of, messaging, helped, define, hezbollah, s, brand, in, the, journalistic, context, advertisements, evolved, from, the, traditional, commercial, advertisements, to, include, also, a, new, type, in, the, form, of, paid, articles, or, broadcasts, disguised, as, news, these, generally, present, an, issue, in, a, very, subjective, and, often, misleading, light, primarily, meant, to, persuade, rather, than, inform, normally, they, use, only, subtle, propaganda, techniques, and, not, the, more, obvious, ones, used, in, traditional, commercial, advertisements, if, the, reader, believes, that, a, paid, advertisement, is, in, fact, a, news, item, the, message, the, advertiser, is, trying, to, communicate, will, be, more, easily, believed, or, internalized, such, advertisements, are, considered, obvious, examples, of, covert, propaganda, because, they, take, on, the, appearance, of, objective, information, rather, than, the, appearance, of, propaganda, which, is, misleading, federal, law, specifically, mandates, that, any, advertisement, appearing, in, the, format, of, a, news, item, must, state, that, the, item, is, in, fact, a, paid, advertisement, edmund, mcgarry, illustrates, that, advertising, is, more, than, selling, to, an, audience, but, a, type, of, propaganda, that, is, trying, to, persuade, the, public, and, not, to, be, balanced, in, judgement, propaganda, has, become, more, common, in, political, contexts, in, particular, to, refer, to, certain, efforts, sponsored, by, governments, political, groups, but, also, often, covert, interests, in, the, early, 20th, century, propaganda, was, exemplified, in, the, form, of, party, slogans, propaganda, also, has, much, in, common, with, public, information, campaigns, by, governments, which, are, intended, to, encourage, or, discourage, certain, forms, of, behavior, such, as, wearing, seat, belts, not, smoking, not, littering, and, so, forth, again, the, emphasis, is, more, political, in, propaganda, propaganda, can, take, the, form, of, leaflets, posters, tv, and, radio, broadcasts, and, can, also, extend, to, any, other, medium, in, the, case, of, the, united, states, there, is, also, an, important, legal, imposed, by, law, distinction, between, advertising, a, type, of, overt, propaganda, and, what, the, government, accountability, office, gao, an, arm, of, the, united, states, congress, refers, to, as, covert, propaganda, propaganda, is, divided, into, two, in, political, situations, they, are, preparation, meaning, to, create, a, new, frame, of, mind, or, view, of, things, and, operational, meaning, they, instigate, actions, roderick, hindery, argues, that, propaganda, exists, on, the, political, left, and, right, and, in, mainstream, centrist, parties, hindery, further, argues, that, debates, about, most, social, issues, can, be, productively, revisited, in, the, context, of, asking, what, is, or, is, not, propaganda, not, to, be, overlooked, is, the, link, between, propaganda, indoctrination, and, terrorism, counterterrorism, he, argues, that, threats, to, destroy, are, often, as, socially, disruptive, as, physical, devastation, itself, since, 9, 11, and, the, appearance, of, greater, media, fluidity, propaganda, institutions, practices, and, legal, frameworks, have, been, evolving, in, the, us, and, britain, briant, shows, how, this, included, expansion, and, integration, of, the, apparatus, cross, government, and, details, attempts, to, coordinate, the, forms, of, propaganda, for, foreign, and, domestic, audiences, with, new, efforts, in, strategic, communication, these, were, subject, to, contestation, within, the, us, government, resisted, by, pentagon, public, affairs, and, critiqued, by, some, scholars, the, national, defense, authorization, act, for, fiscal, year, 2013, section, 1078, a, amended, the, us, information, and, educational, exchange, act, of, 1948, popularly, referred, to, as, the, smith, mundt, act, and, the, foreign, relations, authorization, act, of, 1987, allowing, for, materials, produced, by, the, state, department, and, the, broadcasting, board, of, governors, bbg, to, be, released, within, u, s, borders, for, the, archivist, of, the, united, states, the, smith, mundt, act, as, amended, provided, that, the, secretary, and, the,

governors, from, engaging, in, any, medium, or, form, of, communication, either, directly, or, indirectly, because, a, united, states, domestic, audience, is, or, may, be, thereby, exposed, to, program, material, or, based, on, a, presumption, of, such, exposure, public, concerns, were, raised, upon, passage, due, to, the, relaxation, of, prohibitions, of, domestic, propaganda, in, the, united, states, in, the, wake, of, this, the, internet, has, become, a, prolific, method, of, distributing, political, propaganda, benefiting, from, an, evolution, in, coding, called, bots, software, agents, or, bots, can, be, used, for, many, things, including, populating, social, media, with, automated, messages, and, posts, with, a, range, of, sophistication, during, the, 2016, u, s, election, a, cyber, strategy, was, implemented, using, bots, to, direct, us, voters, to, russian, political, news, and, information, sources, and, to, spread, politically, motivated, rumors, and, false, news, stories, at, this, point, it, is, considered, commonplace, contemporary, political, strategy, around, the, world, to, implement, bots, in, achieving, political, goals, common, media, for, transmitting, propaganda, messages, include, news, reports, government, reports, historical, revision, junk, science, books, leaflets, movies, radio, television, and, posters, some, propaganda, campaigns, follow, a, strategic, transmission, pattern, to, indoctrinate, the, target, group, this, may, begin, with, a, simple, transmission, such, as, a, leaflet, or, advertisement, dropped, from, a, plane, or, an, advertisement, generally, these, messages, will, contain, directions, on, how, to, obtain, more, information, via, a, website, hotline, radio, program, etc, as, it, is, seen, also, for, selling, purposes, among, other, goals, the, strategy, intends, to, initiate, the, individual, from, information, recipient, to, information, seeker, through, reinforcement, and, then, from, information, seeker, to, opinion, leader, through, indoctrination, a, number, of, techniques, based, in, social, psychological, research, are, used, to, generate, propaganda, many, of, these, same, techniques, can, be, found, under, logical, fallacies, since, propagandists, use, arguments, that, while, sometimes, convincing, are, not, necessarily, valid, some, time, has, been, spent, analyzing, the, means, by, which, the, propaganda, messages, are, transmitted, that, work, is, important, but, it, is, clear, that, information, dissemination, strategies, become, propaganda, strategies, only, when, coupled, with, propagandistic, messages, identifying, these, messages, is, a, necessary, prerequisite, to, study, the, methods, by, which, those, messages, are, spread, propaganda, can, also, be, turned, on, its, makers, for, example, postage, stamps, have, frequently, been, tools, for, government, advertising, such, as, north, korea, s, extensive, issues, the, presence, of, stalin, on, numerous, soviet, stamps, is, another, example, in, nazi, germany, hitler, frequently, appeared, on, postage, stamps, in, germany, and, some, of, the, occupied, nations, a, british, program, to,

haifeng, huang, argues, that, propaganda, is, not, always, necessarily, about, convincing, a, populace, of, its, message, and, may, actually, fail, to, do, this, but, instead, can, also, function, as, a, means, of, intimidating, the, citizenry, and, signalling, the, regime, s, strength, and, ability, to, maintain, its, control, and, power, over, society, by, investing, significant, resources, into, propaganda, the, regime, can, forewarn, its, citizens, of, its, strength, and, deterring, them, from, attempting, to, challenge, it, during, the, 1930s, educators, in, the, united, states, and, around, the, world, became, concerned, about, the, rise, of, anti, semitism, and, other, forms, of, violent, extremism, the, institute, for, propaganda, analysis, was, formed, to, introduce, methods,

that, news, and, journalism, could, function, as, propaganda, when, business, and, government, interests, were, amplified, by, mass, media, the, propaganda, model, is, a, theory, advanced, by, edward, s, herman, and, noam, chomsky, which, argues, systemic, biases, exist, in, mass, media, that, are, shaped, by, structural, economic, causes, it, argues, that, the, way, in, which, commercial, media, institutions, are, structured, and, operate, e, g, through, advertising, revenue, concentration, of, media, ownership, or, access, to, sources, creates, an, inherent, conflict, of, interest, that,

authors, as, being, the, most, important, although, the, model, was, based, mainly, on, the, characterization, of, united, states, media, chomsky, and, herman, believe, the, theory, is, equally, applicable, to, any, country, that, shares, the, basic, political, economic, structure, and, the, model, has, subsequently, been, applied, by, other, scholars, to, study, media, bias, in, other,
