yoruba, us, j, r, b, uk, j, r, b, yor, d, yor, b, ipa, ajami, is, a, language, that, is, spoken, in, west, africa, primarily, in, southwestern, and, central, nigeria, it, is, spoken, by, the, yoruba, people, yoruba, speakers, number, roughly, 47, million, including, about, 2, million, second, language, speakers, as, a, pluricentric, language, it, is, primarily, spoken, in, a, dialectal, area, spanning, nigeria, benin, and, togo, with, smaller, migrated, communities, in, c, te, d, ivoire, sierra, leone, and, the, gambia, yoruba, vocabulary, is, also, used, in, african, diaspora, religions, such, as, the, afro, brazilian, religion, of, candombl, the, caribbean, religion, of, santer, a, in, the, form, of, the, liturgical, lucum, language, and, various, afro, american, religions, of, north, america, most, modern, practitioners, of, these, religions, in, the, americas, are, not, fluent, in, the, yoruba, language, yet, they, still, use, yoruba, words, and, phrases, for, songs, or, chants, rooted, in, cultural, traditions, for, such, practicioners, the, yoruba, lexicon, is, especially, common, for, ritual, purposes, and, these, modern, manifestions, have, taken, new, forms, that, don, t, depend, on, vernacular, fluency, as, the, principal, yoruboid, language, yoruba, is, most, closely, related, to, the, languages, itsekiri, spoken, in, the, niger, delta, and, igala, spoken, in, central, nigeria, yoruba, is, classified, among, the, edekiri, languages, which, is, together, with, the, itsekiri, and, isolate, igala, from, the, yoruboid, group, of, languages, within, the, volta, niger, branch, of, the, niger, congo, family, the, linguistic, unity, of, the, niger, congo, family, dates, to, deep, pre, history, estimates, ranging, around, 11, 000, years, ago, the, end, of, the, upper, paleolithic, in, present, day, nigeria, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, around, 50, million, yoruba, primary, and, secondary, language, speakers, as, well, as, several, other, millions, of, speakers, outside, nigeria, making, it, the, most, widely, spoken, african, language, outside, of, the, continent, there, is, a, substantial, body, of, literature, in, the, yoruba, language, including, books, newspapers, and, pamphlets, yoruba, is, used, in, radio, and, television, broadcasting, and, is, taught, at, primary, secondary, and, university, levels, the, yoruba, group, is, assumed, to, have, developed, out, of, undifferentiated, volta, niger, speaking, populations, by, the, 1st, millennium, bce, settlements, of, early, yoruba, speakers, are, assumed, to, correspond, to, those, found, in, the, wider, niger, area, from, about, the, 4th, century, bce, mainly, at, if, the, north, west, yoruba, dialects, show, more, linguistic, innovation, than, the, southeast, and, central, dialects, since, the, latter, areas, also, generally, have, older, settlements, this, suggests, a, later, date, for, migration, into, northwestern, yorubaland, according, to, the, kay, williamson, scale, the, following, is, the, degree, of, relationship, between, itsekiri, and, other, yoruboid, dialects, using, a, compiled, word, list, of, the, most, common, words, a, similarity, of, 100, would, mean, a, total, overlap, of, two, dialects, while, a, similarity, of, 0, would, mean, two, speech, areas, that, have, no, relationship, the, result, of, the, wordlist, analysis, shows, that, itsekiri, bears, the, most, substantial, similarity, to, the, south, east, yoruba, dialects, particularly, ilaje, and, ikale, at, 80, 4, and, 82, 3, similarity, according, to, the, language, assessment, criteria, of, the, international, language, assessment, conference, 1992, only, when, a, wordlist, analysis, shows, a, lexical, similarity, of, below, 70, are, two, speech, forms, considered, different, languages, an, overlap, of, 70, and, above, indicates, that, both, speech, forms, are, the, same, language, however, dialect, intelligibility, tests, would, need, to, be, carried, out, to, determine, how, well, speakers, of, one, dialect, can, understand, the, other, speech, form, thus, while, the, analysis, shows, that, igala, with, an, overlap, of, 60, is, a, completely, different, language, all, other, yoruboid, speech, forms, are, merely, dialects, of, the, same, language, the, yoruba, dialect, continuum, consists, of, several, dialects, the, various, yoruba, dialects, in, yorubaland, nigeria, can, be, classified, into, five, major, dialect, areas, northwest, northeast, central, southwest, and, southeast, clear, boundaries, cannot, be, drawn, peripheral, areas, of, dialectal, regions, often, have, some, similarities, to, adjoining, dialects, north, west, yoruba, was, historically, spoken, in, the, y, empire, in, nwy, dialects, proto, yoruba, velar, fricative, and, labialized, voiced, velar, g, have, merged, into, w, the, upper, vowels, and, were, raised, and, merged, with, i, and, u, just, as, their, nasal, counterparts, resulting, in, a, vowel, system, with, seven, oral, and, three, nasal, vowels, south, east, yoruba, was, most, likely, associated, with, the, expansion, of, the, benin, empire, after, c, 1450, in, contrast, to, nwy, lineage, and, descent, are, largely, multilineal, and, cognatic, and, the, division, of, titles, into, war, and, civil, is, unknown, linguistically, sey, has, retained, the, and, gw, contrast, while, it, has, lowered, the, nasal, vowels, and, to, and, respectively, sey, has, collapsed, the, second, and, third, person, plural, pronominal, forms, thus, n, n, w, can, mean, either, you, pl, came, or, they, came, in, sey, dialects, whereas, nwy, for, example, has, w, you, pl, came, and, w, n, w, they, came, respectively, the, emergence, of, a, plural, of, respect, may, have, prevented, the, coalescence, of, the, two, in, nwy, dialects, central, yoruba, forms, a, transitional, area, in, that, the, lexicon, has, much, in, common, with, nwy, and, shares, many, ethnographical, features, with, sey, its, vowel, system, is, the, most, traditional, of, the, three, dialect, groups, retaining, nine, oral, vowel, contrasts, six, or, seven, nasal, vowels, and, an, extensive, vowel, harmony, system, peculiar, to, central, and, eastern, ney, sey, yoruba, also, is, the, ability, to, begin, words, with, the, vowel, which, in, western, yoruba, has, been, changed, to, literary, yoruba, also, known, as, standard, yoruba, yoruba, koin, and, common, yoruba, is, a, separate, member, of, the, dialect, cluster, it, is, the, written, form, of, the, language, the, standard, variety, learned, at, school, and, that, is, spoken, by, newsreaders, on, the, radio, standard, yoruba, has, its, origin, in, the, 1850s, when, samuel, a, crowther, the, first, native, african, anglican, bishop, published, a, yoruba, grammar, and, started, his, translation, of, the, bible, though, for, a, large, part, based, on, the, y, and, ibadan, dialects, standard, yoruba, incorporates, several, features, from, other, dialects, it, also, has, some, features, peculiar, to, itself, for, example, the, simplified, vowel, harmony, system, as, well, as, foreign, structures, such, as, calques, from, english, that, originated, in, early, translations, of, religious, works, because, the, use, of, standard, yoruba, did, not, result, from, some, deliberate, linguistic, policy, much, controversy, exists, as, to, what, constitutes, genuine, yoruba, with, some, writers, holding, the, opinion, that, the, y, dialect, is, the, pure, form, and, others, stating, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, genuine, yoruba, at, all, standard, yoruba, the, variety, learned, at, school, and, used, in, the, media, has, nonetheless, been, a, decisive, consolidating, factor, in, the, emergence, of, a, common, yoruba, identity, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, presence, of, islam, and, literacy, goes, back, to, the, 14th, century, the, earliest, documented, history, of, the, people, traced, to, the, latter, part, of, the, 17th, century, was, in, the, yoruba, but, in, the, arabic, script, called, ajami, this, makes, yoruba, one, of, the, oldest, african, languages, with, an, attested, history, of, ajami, cf, mumin, versteegh, 2014, hofheinz, 2018, however, the, oldest, extant, yoruba, ajami, exemplar, is, a, 19th, century, islamic, verse, waka, by, badamasi, agbaji, d, 1895, hunwick, 1995, there, are, several, items, of, yoruba, ajami, in, poetry, personal, notes, and, esoteric, knowledge, cf, bang, 2019, nevertheless, yoruba, ajami, remained, idiosyncratic, and, not, socially, diffused, as, no, standardized, orthography, existed, the, plethora, of, dialects, and, the, absence, of, a, central, promotional, institution, among, others, are, responsible, in, the, 17th, century, yoruba, was, written, in, the, ajami, script, a, form, of, arabic, script, it, is, still, written, in, the, ajami, writing, script, in, some, islamic, circles, standard, yoruba, orthography, originated, in, the, early, work, of, church, mission, society, missionaries, working, among, the, aku, yoruba, of, freetown, one, of, their, informants, was, crowther, who, later, would, proceed, to, work, on, his, native, language, himself, in, early, grammar, primers, and, translations, of, portions, of, the, english, bible, crowther, used, the, latin, alphabet, largely, without, tone, markings, the, only, diacritic, used, was, a, dot, below, certain, vowels, to, signify, their, open, variants, and, viz, and, over, the, years, the, orthography, was, revised, to, represent, tone, among, other, things, in, 1875, the, church, missionary, society, cms, organized, a, conference, on, yoruba, orthography, the, standard, devised, there, was, the, basis, for, the, orthography, of, the, steady, flow, of, religious, and, educational, literature, over, the, next, seventy, years, the, current, orthography, of, yoruba, derives, from, a, 1966, report, of, the, yoruba, orthography, committee, along, with, ay, bamgbo, e, s, 1965, yoruba, orthography, a, study, of, the, earlier, orthographies, and, an, attempt, to, bring, yoruba, orthography, in, line, with, actual, speech, as, much, as, possible, still, similar, to, the, older, orthography, it, employs, the, latin, alphabet, modified, by, the, use, of, the, digraph, gb, and, certain, diacritics, including, the, underdots, under, the, letters, and, previously, the, vertical, line, had, been, used, to, avoid, the, mark, being, fully, covered, by, an, underline, as, in, e, o, s, however, that, usage, is, no, longer, common, the, latin, letters, c, q, v, x, z, are, not, used, as, part, of, the, official, orthography, of, standard, yoruba, however, they, exist, in, several, yoruba, dialects, the, pronunciation, of, the, letters, without, diacritics, corresponds, more, or, less, to, their, international, phonetic, alphabet, equivalents, except, for, the, labial, velar, consonant, written, p, and, written, gb, in, which, both, consonants, are, pronounced, simultaneously, rather, than, sequentially, the, diacritic, underneath, vowels, indicates, an, open, vowel, pronounced, with, the, root, of, the, tongue, retracted, so, is, pronounced, and, is, represents, a, postalveolar, consonant, like, the, english, sh, y, represents, a, palatal, approximant, like, english, y, and, j, a, voiced, palatal, stop, as, is, common, in, many, african, orthographies, in, addition, to, the, underdots, three, further, diacritics, are, used, on, vowels, and, syllabic, nasal, consonants, to, indicate, the, language, s, tones, an, acute, accent, for, the, high, tone, a, grave, accent, for, the, low, tone, and, an, optional, macron, for, the, middle, tone, these, are, used, in, addition, to, the, underdots, in, and, when, more, than, one, tone, is, used, in, one, syllable, the, vowel, can, either, be, written, once, for, each, tone, for, example, for, a, vowel, with, tone, rising, from, low, to, high, or, more, rarely, in, current, usage, combined, into, a, single, accent, in, this, case, a, caron, is, used, for, the, rising, tone, so, the, previous, example, would, be, written, and, a, circumflex, for, the, falling, tone, in, benin, yoruba, uses, a, different, orthography, the, yoruba, alphabet, was, standardized, along, with, other, benin, languages, in, the, national, languages, alphabet, by, the, national, language, commission, in, 1975, and, revised, in, 1990, and, 2008, by, the, national, center, for, applied, linguistics, in, 2011, a, beninese, priest, chief, by, the, name, of, tol, l, g, nt, s, n, devised, a, new, script, for, yoruba, based, on, a, vision, received, in, his, sleep, which, he, believed, to, have, been, granted, by, oduduwa, this, oduduwa, script, has, also, received, support, from, other, prominent, chiefs, in, the, yorubaland, region, of, both, countries, the, syllable, structure, of, yoruba, is, c, v, n, syllabic, nasals, are, also, possible, every, syllable, bears, one, of, the, three, tones, high, mid, generally, left, unmarked, and, low, the, sentence, n, l, i, didn, t, go, provides, examples, of, three, syllable, types, standard, yoruba, has, seven, oral, and, five, nasal, vowels, there, are, no, diphthongs, in, yoruba, sequences, of, vowels, are, pronounced, as, separate, syllables, dialects, differ, in, the, number, of, vowels, they, have, see, above, nasal, vowels, are, by, default, written, as, a, vowel, letter, followed, by, n, thus, in, un, n, n, an, these, do, not, occur, word, initially, in, the, standard, language, occurs, only, in, the, single, word, y, n, y, n, that, the, status, of, the, vowel, is, controversial, several, authors, have, argued, it, is, not, phonemically, contrastive, often, it, is, in, free, variation, with, orthographically, n, is, used, after, labial, and, labial, velar, consonants, as, in, b, n, gun, and, an, is, used, after, non, labial, consonants, as, in, d, n, to, shine, all, vowels, are, nasalized, after, the, consonant, m, and, thus, there, is, no, additional, n, in, writing, mi, mu, m, in, addition, the, consonant, l, has, a, nasal, allophone, before, a, nasal, vowel, see, below, and, this, is, reflected, in, writing, in, inside, belly, l, the, voiceless, plosives, t, and, k, are, slightly, aspirated, in, some, yoruba, varieties, t, and, d, are, more, dental, the, rhotic, consonant, is, realized, as, a, flap, or, in, some, varieties, notably, lagos, yoruba, as, the, alveolar, approximant, due, to, english, influence, this, is, particularly, common, with, yoruba, english, bilinguals, like, many, other, languages, of, the, region, yoruba, has, the, voiceless, and, voiced, labial, velar, stops, k, p, and, b, p, p, field, gbogbo, all, notably, it, lacks, a, voiceless, bilabial, stop, p, apart, from, phonaesthesia, such, as, for, vehicle, horn, sounds, and, marginal, segments, found, in, recent, loanwords, such, as, p, s, for, pencil, yoruba, also, lacks, a, phoneme, n, the, letter, n, is, used, for, the, sound, in, the, orthography, but, strictly, speaking, it, refers, to, an, allophone, of, l, immediately, preceding, a, nasal, vowel, there, is, also, a, syllabic, nasal, which, forms, a, syllable, nucleus, by, itself, when, it, precedes, a, vowel, it, is, a, velar, nasal, n, l, i, didn, t, go, in, other, cases, its, place, of, articulation, is, homorganic, with, the, following, consonant, l, he, is, going, f, he, is, jumping, c, q, v, x, and, z, only, appear, in, words, borrowed, from, english, yoruba, is, a, tonal, language, with, three, level, tones, and, two, or, three, contour, tones, every, syllable, must, have, at, least, one, tone, a, syllable, containing, a, long, vowel, can, have, two, tones, tones, are, marked, by, use, of, the, acute, accent, for, high, tone, and, the, grave, accent, for, low, tone, mid, is, unmarked, except, on, syllabic, nasals, where, it, is, indicated, using, a, macron, a, n, examples, when, teaching, yoruba, literacy, solf, ge, names, of, musical, notes, are, used, to, name, the, tones, low, is, do, mid, is, re, and, high, is, mi, apart, from, tone, s, lexical, and, grammatical, use, it, is, also, used, in, other, contexts, such, as, whistling, and, drumming, whistled, yoruba, is, used, to, communicate, over, long, distances, the, language, is, transformed, as, speakers, talk, and, whistle, simultaneously, consonants, are, devoiced, or, turned, to, and, all, vowels, are, changed, to, however, all, tones, are, retained, without, any, alteration, the, retention, of, tones, enables, speakers, to, understand, the, meaning, of, the, whistled, language, the, yoruba, talking, drum, the, d, nd, n, or, iya, ilu, which, accompanies, singing, during, festivals, and, important, ceremonies, also, uses, tone, written, yoruba, includes, diacritical, marks, not, available, on, conventional, computer, keyboards, requiring, some, adaptations, in, particular, the, use, of, the, sub, dots, and, tone, marks, are, not, represented, so, many, yoruba, documents, simply, omit, them, asubiaro, toluwase, in, his, 2014, paper, points, out, that, the, use, of, these, diacritics, can, affect, the, retrieval, of, yoruba, documents, by, popular, search, engines, therefore, their, omission, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, online, research, when, a, word, precedes, another, word, beginning, with, a, vowel, assimilation, or, deletion, elision, of, one, of, the, vowels, often, takes, place, since, syllables, in, yoruba, normally, end, in, a, vowel, and, most, nouns, start, with, one, it, is, a, widespread, phenomenon, and, it, is, absent, only, in, slow, unnatural, speech, the, orthography, here, follows, speech, in, that, word, divisions, are, normally, not, indicated, in, words, that, are, contracted, due, to, assimilation, or, elision, ra, ja, r, ja, buy, fish, sometimes, however, authors, may, choose, to, use, an, inverted, comma, to, indicate, an, elided, vowel, as, in, n, il, n, l, in, the, house, long, vowels, within, words, usually, signal, that, a, consonant, has, been, elided, word, internally, in, such, cases, the, tone, of, the, elided, vowel, is, retained, d, r, r, hearth, kor, ko, ko, ko, grass, t, t, t, truth, most, verbal, roots, are, monosyllabic, of, the, phonological, shape, cv, n, for, example, d, to, create, d, n, to, polish, p, n, to, be, red, verbal, roots, that, do, not, seem, to, follow, this, pattern, are, mostly, former, compounds, in, which, a, syllable, has, been, elided, for, example, nl, to, be, large, originally, a, compound, of, n, to, have, l, to, be, big, and, s, f, to, whistle, originally, a, compound, of, s, to, eject, wind, f, or, f, a, blowing, vowels, serve, as, nominalizing, prefixes, that, turn, a, verb, into, a, noun, form, nominal, roots, are, mostly, disyllabic, for, example, ab, crib, barn, ara, body, ib, fever, monosyllabic, and, even, trisyllabic, roots, do, occur, but, they, are, less, common, yoruba, is, a, highly, isolating, language, its, basic, constituent, order, is, subject, verb, object, as, in, n, ad, he, beat, ad, the, bare, verb, stem, denotes, a, completed, action, often, called, perfect, tense, and, aspect, are, marked, by, preverbal, particles, such, as, imperfect, present, continuous, ti, past, negation, is, expressed, by, a, preverbal, particle, k, serial, verb, constructions, are, common, as, in, many, other, languages, of, west, africa, although, yoruba, has, no, grammatical, gender, it, has, a, distinction, between, human, and, non, human, nouns, when, it, comes, to, interrogative, particles, ta, ni, for, human, nouns, who, and, k, ni, for, non, human, nouns, what, the, associative, construction, covering, possessive, genitive, and, related, notions, consists, of, juxtaposing, nouns, in, the, order, modified, modifier, as, in, in, p, t, inside, box, the, inside, of, the, box, f, l, k, nd, akande, s, cap, or, p, t, a, box, for, clothes, more, than, two, nouns, can, be, juxtaposed, r, l, we, ab, il, railway, underground, underground, railway, in, p, t, a, the, inside, of, the, clothes, box, disambiguation, is, left, to, context, in, the, rare, case, that, it, results, in, two, possible, readings, plural, nouns, are, indicated, by, a, plural, word, there, are, two, prepositions, n, on, at, in, and, s, onto, towards, the, former, indicates, location, and, absence, of, movement, and, the, latter, encodes, location, direction, with, movement, position, and, direction, are, expressed, by, the, prepositions, in, combination, with, spatial, relational, nouns, like, or, top, ap, side, in, inside, et, edge, ab, under, il, down, etc, many, of, the, spatial, relational, terms, are, historically, related, to, body, part, terms, yoruba, uses, a, vigesimal, base, 20, numbering, system, the, wide, adoption, of, imported, religions, and, civilizations, such, as, islam, and, christianity, has, had, an, impact, both, on, written, and, spoken, yoruba, in, his, arabic, english, encyclopedic, dictionary, of, the, quran, and, sunnah, yoruba, muslim, scholar, abu, abdullah, adelabu, argued, islam, has, enriched, african, languages, by, providing, them, with, technical, and, cultural, augmentations, with, swahili, and, somali, in, east, africa, and, turanci, hausa, and, wolof, in, west, africa, being, the, primary, beneficiaries, adelabu, a, ph, d, graduate, from, damascus, cited, among, many, other, common, usages, the, following, words, to, be, yoruba, s, derivatives, of, arabic, vocabularies, some, common, arabic, words, used, in, yoruba, are, names, of, the, days, such, as, atalata, for, tuesday, alaruba, for, wednesday, alamisi, for, thursday, and, jimoh, jumu, ah, for, friday, by, far, j, jimoh, is, the, most, favourably, used, this, is, because, eti, the, yoruba, word, for, friday, means, delay, this, is, an, unpleasant, word, for, friday, t, which, also, implies, failure, laziness, or, abandonment, ultimately, the, standard, words, for, the, days, of, the, week, are, k, aj, gun, j, r, j, b, t, b, m, ta, for, sunday, monday, tuesday,
