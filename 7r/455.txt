mutually, intelligible, with, the, standard, language, or, are, only, partially, intelligible, nevertheless, mandarin, as, a, group, is, often, placed, first, in, lists, of, languages, by, number, of, native, speakers, with, nearly, one, billion, mandarin, is, by, far, the, largest, of, the, chinese, dialect, groups, it, is, spoken, by, 70, percent, of, all, chinese, speakers, over, a, large, geographical, area, that, stretches, from, yunnan, in, the, southwest, to, xinjiang, in, the, northwest, and, heilongjiang, in, the, northeast, this, is, generally, attributed, to, the, greater, ease, of, travel, and, communication, in, the, north, china, plain, compared, to, the, more, mountainous, south, combined, with, the, relatively, recent, spread, of, mandarin, to, frontier, areas, most, mandarin, varieties, have, four, tones, the, final, stops, of, middle, chinese, have, disappeared, in, most, of, these, varieties, but, some, have, merged, them, as, a, final, glottal, stop, many, mandarin, varieties, including, the, beijing, dialect, retain, retroflex, initial, consonants, which, have, been, lost, in, southern, varieties, of, chinese, the, chinese, capital, has, been, within,

officials, and, the, courts, since, the, 14th, century, in, the, early, 20th, century, a, standard, form, based, on, the, beijing, dialect, with, elements, from, other, mandarin, dialects, was, adopted, as, the, national, language, standard, chinese, is, the, official, language, of, china, and, taiwan, as, well, as, one, of, the, four, official, languages, of, singapore, it, is, also, used, as, one, of, the, official, languages, of, the, united, nations, recent, increased, migration, from, mandarin, speaking, regions, of, china, and, taiwan, has, now, resulted, in, the, language, being,

portuguese, mandarim, from, malay, menteri, from, sanskrit, mantr, mantrin, meaning, minister, or, counsellor, originally, meant, an, official, of, the, ming, and, qing, empires, since, their, native, varieties, were, often, mutually, unintelligible, these, officials, communicated, using, a, koin, language, based, on, various, northern, varieties, when, jesuit, missionaries, learned, this, standard, language, in, the, 16th, century, they, called, it, mandarin, from, its, chinese, name, gu, nhu, language, of, the, officials, in, everyday, english, mandarin, refers, to, standard, chinese, which, is, often, called, simply, chinese, standard, mandarin, chinese, is, based, on, beijing, dialect, with, some, lexical, and, syntactic, influence, from, other, mandarin, dialects, it, is, the,

of, dialects, spoken, in, northern, and, southwestern, china, which, chinese, linguists, call, gu, nhu, the, alternative, term, b, if, nghu, northern, dialects, is, used, less, and, less, among, chinese, linguists, by, extension, the, term, old, mandarin, or, early, mandarin, is, used, by, linguists, to, refer, to, the, northern, dialects, recorded, in, materials, from, the, yuan, dynasty, native, speakers, who, are, not, academic, linguists, may, not, recognize, that, the, variants, they, speak, are, classified, in, linguistics, as, members, of, mandarin, or, so, called, northern, dialects, in, a, broader, sense, within, chinese, social, or, cultural, discourse, there, is, not, a, mandarin, identity, based, on, language, rather, there, are, strong, regional, identities, centred, on, individual, dialects, because, of, the, wide, geographical, distribution, and, cultural, diversity, of, their, speakers, speakers, of, forms, of, mandarin, other, than, the, standard, typically, refer, to, the, variety, they, speak, by, a, geographic, name, for, example, the, sichuan, dialect, and, the, hebei, dialect, or, northeastern, dialect, all, being, regarded, as, distinct, from, the, standard, language, with, which, they, may, not, share, much, mutual, intelligibility, the, hundreds, of, modern, local, varieties, of, chinese, developed, from, regional, variants, of, old, chinese, and, middle, chinese, traditionally, seven, major, groups, of, dialects, have, been, recognized, aside, from, mandarin, the, other, six, are, wu, gan, and, xiang, in, central, china, and, min, hakka, and, yue, on, the, southeast, coast, the, language, atlas, of, china, 1987, distinguishes, three, further, groups, jin, split, from, mandarin, huizhou, in, the, huizhou, region, of, anhui, and, zhejiang, and, pinghua, in, guangxi, and, yunnan, after, the, fall, of, the, northern, song, 959, 1126, and, during, the, reign, of, the, jin, 1115, 1234, and, yuan, mongol, dynasties, in, northern, china, a, common, form, of, speech, developed, based, on, the, dialects, of, the, north, china, plain, around, the, capital, a, language, referred, to, as, old, mandarin, new, genres, of, vernacular, literature, were, based, on, this, language, including, verse, drama, and, story, forms, such, as, the, qu, and, sanqu, poetry, the, rhyming, conventions, of, the, new, verse, were, codified, in, a, rime, dictionary, called, the, zhongyuan, yinyun, 1324, a, radical, departure, from, the, rime, table, tradition, that, had, evolved, over, the, previous, centuries, this, dictionary, contains, a, wealth, of, information, on, the, phonology, of, old, mandarin, further, sources, are, the, phags, pa, script, based, on, the, tibetan, alphabet, which, was, used, to, write, several, of, the, languages, of, the, mongol, empire, including, chinese, and, the, menggu, ziyun, a, rime, dictionary, based, on, phags, pa, the, rime, books, differ, in, some, details, but, overall, show, many, of, the, features, characteristic, of, modern, mandarin, dialects, such, as, the, reduction, and, disappearance, of, final, plosives, and, the, reorganization, of, the, middle, chinese, tones, in, middle, chinese, initial, stops, and, affricates, showed, a, three, way, contrast, between, tenuis, voiceless, aspirated, and, voiced, consonants, there, were, four, tones, with, the, fourth, or, entering, tone, a, checked, tone, comprising, syllables, ending, in, plosives, p, t, or, k, syllables, with, voiced, initials, tended, to, be, pronounced, with, a, lower, pitch, and, by, the, late, tang, dynasty, each, of, the, tones, had, split, into, two, registers, conditioned, by, the, initials, when, voicing, was, lost, in, all, languages, except, the, wu, subfamily, this, distinction, became, phonemic, and, the, system, of, initials, and, tones, was, rearranged, differently, in, each, of, the, major, groups, the, zhongyuan, yinyun, shows, the, typical, mandarin, four, tone, system, resulting, from, a, split, of, the, even, tone, and, loss, of, the, entering, tone, with, its, syllables, distributed, across, the, other, tones, though, their, different, origin, is, marked, in, the, dictionary, similarly, voiced, plosives, and, affricates, have, become, voiceless, aspirates, in, the, even, tone, and, voiceless, non, aspirates, in, others, another, distinctive, mandarin, development, however, the, language, still, retained, a, final, m, which, has, merged, with, n, in, modern, dialects, and, initial, voiced, fricatives, it, also, retained, the, distinction, between, velars, and, alveolar, sibilants, in, palatal, environments, which, later, merged, in, most, mandarin, dialects, to, yield, a, palatal, series, rendered, j, q, and, x, in, pinyin, the, flourishing, vernacular, literature, of, the, period, also, shows, distinctively, mandarin, vocabulary, and, syntax, though, some, such, as, the, third, person, pronoun, t, can, be, traced, back, to, the, tang, dynasty, until, the, early, 20th, century, formal, writing, and, even, much, poetry, and, fiction, was, done, in, literary, chinese, which, was, modeled, on, the, classics, of, the, warring, states, period, and, the, han, dynasty, over, time, the, various, spoken, varieties, diverged, greatly, from, literary, chinese, which, was, learned, and, composed, as, a, special, language, preserved, from, the, sound, changes, that, affected, the, various, spoken, varieties, its, economy, of, expression, was, greatly, valued, for, example, y, wing, is, unambiguous, in, written, chinese, but, has, over, 75, homophones, in, standard, chinese, the, literary, language, was, less, appropriate, for, documents, that, were, meant, to, be, performed, or, recited, such, as, plays, or, stories, from, at, least, the, yuan, dynasty, plays, that, recounted, the, subversive, tales, of, china, s, robin, hoods, to, the, ming, dynasty, novels, such, as, water, margin, on, down, to, the, qing, dynasty, novel, dream, of, the, red, chamber, and, beyond, there, developed, a, literature, in, written, vernacular, chinese, b, ihu, in, many, cases, this, written, language, reflected, mandarin, varieties, and, since, pronunciation, differences, were, not, conveyed, in, this, written, form, this, tradition, had, a, unifying, force, across, all, the, mandarin, speaking, regions, and, beyond, hu, shih, a, pivotal, figure, of, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, wrote, an, influential, and, perceptive, study, of, this, literary, tradition, entitled, a, history, of, vernacular, literature, b, ihu, w, nxu, sh, until, the, mid, 20th, century, most, chinese, people, living, in, many, parts, of, south, china, spoke, only, their, local, variety, as, a, practical, measure, officials, of, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, carried, out, the, administration, of, the, empire, using, a, common, language, based, on, mandarin, varieties, known, as, gu, nhu, knowledge, of, this, language, was, thus, essential, for, an, official, career, but, it, was, never, formally, defined, officials, varied, widely, in, their, pronunciation, in, 1728, the, yongzheng, emperor, unable, to, understand, the, accents, of, officials, from, guangdong, and, fujian, issued, a, decree, requiring, the, governors, of, those, provinces, to, provide, for, the, teaching, of, proper, pronunciation, although, the, resulting, academies, for, correct, pronunciation, zh, ngy, n, sh, yu, n, were, short, lived, the, decree, did, spawn, a, number, of, textbooks, that, give, some, insight, into, the, ideal, pronunciation, common, features, included, as, the, last, two, of, these, features, indicate, this, language, was, a, koin, based, on, dialects, spoken, in, the, nanjing, area, though, not, identical, to, any, single, dialect, this, form, remained, prestigious, long, after, the, capital, moved, to, beijing, in, 1421, though, the, speech, of, the, new, capital, emerged, as, a, rival, standard, as, late, as, 1815, robert, morrison, based, the, first, english, chinese, dictionary, on, this, koin, as, the, standard, of, the, time, though, he, conceded, that, the, beijing, dialect, was, gaining, in, influence, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, beijing, dialect, had, become, dominant, and, was, essential, for, any, business, with, the, imperial, court, the, variant, of, mandarin, as, spoken, by, educated, classes, in, beijing, was, made, the, official, language, of, china, by, the, qing, dynasty, in, the, early, 1900s, and, the, successive, republican, government, in, the, early, years, of, the, republic, of, china, intellectuals, of, the, new, culture, movement, such, as, hu, shih, and, chen, duxiu, successfully, campaigned, for, the, replacement, of, literary, chinese, as, the, written, standard, by, written, vernacular, chinese, which, was, based, on, northern, dialects, a, parallel, priority, was, the, definition, of, a, standard, national, language, traditional, chinese, simplified, chinese, pinyin, gu, y, wade, giles, kuo, y, after, much, dispute, between, proponents, of, northern, and, southern, dialects, and, an, abortive, attempt, at, an, artificial, pronunciation, the, national, language, unification, commission, finally, settled, on, the, beijing, dialect, in, 1932, the, people, s, republic, founded, in, 1949, retained, this, standard, calling, it, p, t, nghu, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, lit, common, speech, some, 54, of, speakers, of, mandarin, varieties, could, understand, the, standard, language, in, the, early, 1950s, rising, to, 91, in, 1984, nationally, the, proportion, understanding, the, standard, rose, from, 41, to, 90, over, the, same, period, this, standard, language, is, now, used, in, education, the, media, and, formal, occasions, in, both, mainland, china, and, taiwan, as, well, as, among, the, chinese, community, of, singapore, however, in, other, parts, of, the, chinese, speaking, world, namely, hong, kong, and, macau, the, standard, form, of, chinese, used, in, education, the, media, formal, speech, and, everyday, life, remains, the, local, cantonese, because, of, their, colonial, and, linguistic, history, while, standard, mandarin, is, now, the, medium, of, instruction, in, schools, throughout, china, it, still, has, yet, to, gain, traction, as, a, common, language, among, the, local, population, in, areas, where, mandarin, dialects, are, not, native, in, these, regions, people, may, be, either, diglossic, or, speak, the, standard, language, with, a, notable, accent, however, since, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, there, has, been, an, effort, of, mass, education, in, standard, mandarin, chinese, and, discouragement, of, local, language, usage, by, the, chinese, government, in, order, to, erase, these, regional, differences, from, an, official, point, of, view, the, mainland, chinese, and, the, taiwanese, governments, maintain, their, own, forms, of, the, standard, under, different, names, the, codified, forms, of, both, p, t, nghu, and, gu, y, base, their, phonology, on, the, beijing, accent, and, also, take, some, elements, from, other, sources, and, deviate, from, the, beijing, dialect, in, vocabulary, grammar, and, pragmatics, comparison, of, dictionaries, produced, in, the, two, areas, will, show, that, there, are, few, substantial, differences, however, both, versions, of, school, standard, chinese, are, often, quite, different, from, the, mandarin, varieties, that, are, spoken, in, accordance, with, regional, habits, and, neither, is, wholly, identical, to, the, beijing, dialect, the, written, forms, of, standard, chinese, are, also, essentially, equivalent, although, simplified, characters, are, used, in, mainland, china, and, singapore, while, traditional, characters, remain, in, use, in, taiwan, hong, kong, and, macau, singapore, has, followed, mainland, china, in, officially, adopting, simplified, characters, mandarin, is, spoken, across, northern, and, southwestern, china, with, some, pockets, in, neighbouring, countries, unlike, their, compatriots, on, the, southeast, coast, few, mandarin, speakers, engaged, in, overseas, emigration, until, the, late, 20th, century, but, there, are, now, significant, communities, of, them, in, cities, across, the, world, most, han, chinese, living, in, northern, and, southwestern, china, are, native, speakers, of, a, dialect, of, mandarin, the, north, china, plain, provided, few, barriers, to, migration, leading, to, relative, linguistic, homogeneity, over, a, wide, area, in, northern, china, in, contrast, the, mountains, and, rivers, of, southern, china, have, spawned, the, other, six, major, groups, of, chinese, varieties, with, great, internal, diversity, particularly, in, fujian, however, the, varieties, of, mandarin, cover, a, huge, area, containing, nearly, a, billion, people, as, a, result, there, are, pronounced, regional, variations, in, pronunciation, vocabulary, and, grammar, and, many, mandarin, varieties, are, not, mutually, intelligible, most, of, northeast, china, except, for, liaoning, did, not, receive, significant, settlements, by, han, chinese, until, the, 18th, century, and, as, a, result, the, northeastern, mandarin, dialects, spoken, there, differ, little, from, the, beijing, dialect, the, manchu, people, of, the, area, now, speak, these, dialects, exclusively, their, native, language, is, only, maintained, in, northwestern, xinjiang, where, xibe, a, modern, dialect, is, spoken, the, frontier, areas, of, northwest, china, were, colonized, by, speakers, of, mandarin, dialects, at, the, same, time, and, the, dialects, in, those, areas, similarly, closely, resemble, their, relatives, in, the, core, mandarin, area, the, southwest, was, settled, early, but, the, population, fell, dramatically, for, obscure, reasons, in, the, 13th, century, and, did, not, recover, until, the, 17th, century, the, dialects, in, this, area, are, now, relatively, uniform, however, long, established, cities, even, very, close, to, beijing, such, as, tianjin, baoding, shenyang, and, dalian, have, markedly, different, dialects, standard, mandarin, is, one, of, the, official, languages, of, taiwan, the, taiwanese, standard, of, mandarin, differs, very, little, from, that, of, mainland, china, with, differences, largely, in, some, technical, vocabulary, developed, from, the, 1950s, onwards, while, the, spoken, standard, of, taiwanese, mandarin, is, nearly, identical, to, that, of, mainland, china, the, colloquial, form, has, been, heavily, influenced, by, other, local, languages, especially, taiwanese, hokkien, notable, differences, include, the, merger, of, retroflex, sounds, zh, ch, sh, r, with, the, alveolar, series, z, c, s, frequent, mergers, of, the, neutral, tone, with, a, word, s, original, tone, and, absence, of, erhua, code, switching, between, mandarin, and, taiwanese, hokkien, is, common, as, the, majority, of, the, population, continues, to, also, speak, the, latter, as, a, native, language, mandarin, is, one, of, the, four, official, languages, of, singapore, along, with, english, malay, and, tamil, historically, it, was, seldom, used, by, the, chinese, singaporean, community, which, primarily, spoke, the, southern, chinese, languages, of, hokkien, teochew, cantonese, or, hakka, the, launch, of, the, speak, mandarin, campaign, in, 1979, by, the, government, prioritized, the, language, over, traditional, vernaculars, in, an, attempt, to, create, a, common, ethnic, language, and, foster, closer, connections, to, china, this, has, led, to, a, significant, increase, and, presence, of, mandarin, usage, in, the, country, coupled, with, a, strong, decline, in, usage, of, other, chinese, variants, standard, singaporean, mandarin, is, nearly, identical, to, the, standards, of, china, and, taiwan, with, minor, vocabulary, differences, it, is, the, mandarin, variant, used, in, education, media, and, official, settings, meanwhile, a, colloquial, form, called, singdarin, is, used, in, informal, daily, life, and, is, heavily, influenced, in, terms, of, both, grammar, and, vocabulary, by, local, languages, such, as, cantonese, hokkien, and, malay, instances, of, code, switching, with, english, hokkien, cantonese, malay, or, a, combination, of, any, of, these, is, also, common, in, malaysia, mandarin, has, been, adopted, by, local, chinese, language, schools, as, the, medium, of, instruction, with, the, standard, based, on, that, of, singapore, however, it, is, not, as, widespread, in, daily, life, among, the, malaysian, chinese, community, as, hokkien, speakers, continue, to, form, a, plurality, among, the, ethnic, chinese, population, and, cantonese, serves, as, the, common, language, especially, in, commerce, and, local, media, an, exception, is, in, the, state, of, johor, where, mandarin, is, increasingly, used, alongside, cantonese, as, a, lingua, franca, in, part, due, to, singaporean, influence, as, in, singapore, the, local, colloquial, variant, of, mandarin, exhibits, influences, from, cantonese, and, malay, in, northern, myanmar, a, southwestern, mandarin, variant, close, to, the, yunnanese, dialect, is, spoken, by, local, chinese, and, other, ethnic, groups, in, some, rebel, group, controlled, regions, mandarin, also, serves, as, the, lingua, franca, the, dungan, people, of, kyrgyzstan, kazakhstan, and, uzbekistan, are, descendants, of, hui, people, who, fled, to, the, russian, empire, from, dzungaria, in, 1877, after, the, fall, of, kashgaria, to, qing, forces, and, from, the, ili, valley, after, it, was, ceded, to, china, in, the, treaty, of, saint, petersburg, in, 1881, about, 500, speakers, live, in, a, compact, area, in, rovensky, district, saratov, oblast, in, russia, the, dungan, speak, two, dialects, descended, from, central, plains, mandarin, dialects, of, southeast, gansu, and, southwest, shaanxi, and, write, their, language, in, the, cyrillic, script, the, classification, of, chinese, dialects, evolved, during, the, 20th, century, and, many, points, remain, unsettled, early, classifications, tended, to, follow, provincial, boundaries, or, major, geographical, features, in, 1936, wang, li, produced, the, first, classification, based, on, phonetic, criteria, principally, the, evolution, of, middle, chinese, voiced, initials, his, mandarin, group, included, dialects, of, northern, and, southwestern, china, as, well, as, those, of, hunan, and, northern, jiangxi, li, fang, kuei, s, classification, of, 1937, distinguished, the, latter, two, groups, as, xiang, and, gan, while, splitting, the, remaining, mandarin, dialects, between, northern, lower, yangtze, and, southwestern, mandarin, groups, the, widely, accepted, seven, group, classification, of, yuan, jiahua, in, 1960, kept, xiang, and, gan, separate, with, mandarin, divided, into, northern, northwestern, southwestern, and, jiang, huai, lower, yangtze, subgroups, of, yuan, s, four, mandarin, subgroups, the, northwestern, dialects, are, the, most, diverse, particularly, in, the, province, of, shanxi, the, linguist, li, rong, proposed, that, the, northwestern, dialects, of, shanxi, and, neighbouring, areas, that, retain, a, final, glottal, stop, in, the, middle, chinese, entering, tone, plosive, final, category, should, constitute, a, separate, top, level, group, called, jin, he, used, this, classification, in, the, language, atlas, of, china, 1987, many, other, linguists, continue, to, include, these, dialects, in, the, mandarin, group, pointing, out, that, the, lower, yangtze, dialects, also, retain, the, glottal, stop, the, southern, boundary, of, the, mandarin, area, with, the, central, wu, gan, and, xiang, groups, is, weakly, defined, due, to, centuries, of, diffusion, of, northern, features, many, border, varieties, have, a, mixture, of, features, that, make, them, difficult, to, classify, the, boundary, between, southwestern, mandarin, and, xiang, is, particularly, weak, and, in, many, early, classifications, the, two, were, not, separated, zhou, zhenhe, and, you, rujie, include, the, new, xiang, dialects, within, southwestern, mandarin, treating, only, the, more, conservative, old, xiang, dialects, as, a, separate, group, the, huizhou, dialects, have, features, of, both, mandarin, and, wu, and, have, been, assigned, to, one, or, other, of, these, groups, or, treated, as, separate, by, various, authors, li, rong, and, the, language, atlas, of, china, treated, it, as, a, separate, top, level, group, but, this, remains, controversial, the, language, atlas, of, china, calls, the, remainder, of, mandarin, a, supergroup, divided, into, eight, dialect, groups, distinguished, by, their, treatment, of, the, middle, chinese, entering, tone, see, tones, below, the, atlas, also, includes, several, unclassified, mandarin, dialects, spoken, in, scattered, pockets, across, southeastern, china, such, as, nanping, in, fujian, and, dongfang, on, hainan, another, mandarin, variety, of, uncertain, classification, is, apparently, gyami, recorded, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, tibetan, foothills, who, the, chinese, apparently, did, not, recognize, as, chinese, some, northwestern, mandarin, varieties, in, the, qinghai, gansu, sprachbund, have, undergone, drastic, changes, in, phonology, lexicon, and, grammar, a, syllable, consists, maximally, of, an, initial, consonant, a, medial, glide, a, vowel, a, coda, and, tone, in, the, traditional, analysis, the, medial, vowel, and, coda, are, combined, as, a, final, not, all, combinations, occur, for, example, standard, chinese, based, on, the, beijing, dialect, has, about, 1, 200, distinct, syllables, phonological, features, that, are, generally, shared, by, the, mandarin, dialects, include, the, maximal, inventory, of, initials, of, a, mandarin, dialect, is, as, follows, with, bracketed, pinyin, spellings, given, for, those, present, in, the, standard, language, most, mandarin, dialects, have, three, medial, glides, j, w, and, spelled, i, u, and, in, pinyin, though, their, incidence, varies, the, medial, w, is, lost, after, apical, initials, in, several, areas, thus, southwestern, mandarin, has, tei, correct, where, the, standard, language, has, dui, twei, southwestern, mandarin, also, has, kai, k, ai, xai, in, some, words, where, the, standard, has, jie, qie, xie, t, j, t, j, j, this, is, a, stereotypical, feature, of, southwestern, mandarin, since, it, is, so, easily, noticeable, e, g, hai, shoe, for, standard, xie, gai, street, for, standard, jie, mandarin, dialects, typically, have, relatively, few, vowels, syllabic, fricatives, as, in, standard, zi, and, zhi, are, common, in, mandarin, dialects, though, they, also, occur, elsewhere, the, middle, chinese, off, glides, j, and, w, are, generally, preserved, in, mandarin, dialects, yielding, several, diphthongs, and, triphthongs, in, contrast, to, the, larger, sets, of, monophthongs, common, in, other, dialect, groups, and, some, widely, scattered, mandarin, dialects, the, middle, chinese, coda, m, was, still, present, in, old, mandarin, but, has, merged, with, n, in, the, modern, dialects, in, some, areas, especially, the, southwest, final, has, also, merged, with, n, this, is, especially, prevalent, in, the, rhyme, pairs, en, eng, n, and, in, ing, in, i, as, a, result, j, n, gold, and, j, ng, capital, merge, in, those, dialects, the, middle, chinese, final, stops, have, undergone, a, variety, of, developments, in, different, mandarin, dialects, see, tones, below, in, lower, yangtze, dialects, and, some, north, western, dialects, they, have, merged, as, a, final, glottal, stop, in, other, dialects, they, have, been, lost, with, varying, effects, on, the, vowel, as, a, result, beijing, mandarin, and, northeastern, mandarin, underwent, more, vowel, mergers, than, many, other, varieties, of, mandarin, for, example, r, coloring, a, characteristic, feature, of, mandarin, works, quite, differently, in, the, southwest, whereas, beijing, dialect, generally, removes, only, a, final, j, or, n, when, adding, the, rhotic, final, r, in, the, southwest, the, r, replaces, nearly, the, entire, rhyme, in, general, no, two, mandarin, speaking, areas, have, exactly, the, same, set, of, tone, values, but, most, mandarin, speaking, areas, have, very, similar, tone, distribution, for, example, the, dialects, of, jinan, chengdu, xi, an, and, so, on, all, have, four, tones, that, correspond, quite, well, to, the, beijing, dialect, tones, of, 55, 35, 214, and, 51, the, exception, to, this, rule, lies, in, the, distribution, of, syllables, formerly, ending, in, a, stop, consonant, which, are, treated, differently, in, different, dialects, of, mandarin, middle, chinese, stops, and, affricates, had, a, three, way, distinction, between, tenuis, voiceless, aspirate, and, voiced, or, breathy, voiced, consonants, in, mandarin, dialects, the, voicing, is, generally, lost, yielding, voiceless, aspirates, in, syllables, with, a, middle, chinese, level, tone, and, non, aspirates, in, other, syllables, of, the, four, tones, of, middle, chinese, the, level, rising, and, departing, tones, have, also, developed, into, four, modern, tones, in, a, uniform, way, across, mandarin, dialects, the, middle, chinese, level, tone, has, split, into, two, registers, conditioned, on, voicing, of, the, middle, chinese, initial, while, rising, tone, syllables, with, voiced, obstruent, initials, have, shifted, to, the, departing, tone, the, following, examples, from, the, standard, language, illustrate, the, regular, development, common, to, mandarin, dialects, recall, that, pinyin, d, denotes, a, non, aspirate, t, while, t, denotes, an, aspirate, t, in, traditional, chinese, phonology, syllables, that, ended, in, a, stop, in, middle, chinese, i, e, p, t, or, k, were, considered, to, belong, to, a, special, category, known, as, the, entering, tone, these, final, stops, have, disappeared, in, most, mandarin, dialects, with, the, syllables, distributed, over, the, other, four, modern, tones, in, different, ways, in, the, various, mandarin, subgroups, in, the, beijing, dialect, that, underlies, the, standard, language, syllables, beginning, with, original, voiceless, consonants, were, redistributed, across, the, four, tones, in, a, completely, random, pattern, for, example, the, three, characters, all, tsjek, in, middle, chinese, william, h, baxter, s, transcription, are, now, pronounced, j, j, and, j, respectively, older, dictionaries, such, as, mathews, chinese, english, dictionary, mark, characters, whose, pronunciation, formerly, ended, with, a, stop, with, a, superscript, 5, however, this, tone, number, is, more, commonly, used, for, syllables, that, always, have, a, neutral, tone, see, below, in, lower, yangtze, dialects, a, minority, of, southwestern, dialects, e, g, minjiang, and, jin, chinese, sometimes, considered, non, mandarin, former, final, stops, were, not, deleted, entirely, but, were, reduced, to, a, glottal, stop, this, includes, the, dialect, of, nanjing, on, which, the, postal, romanization, was, based, it, transcribes, the, glottal, stop, as, a, trailing, h, this, development, is, shared, with, wu, chinese, and, is, thought, to, represent, the, pronunciation, of, old, mandarin, in, line, with, traditional, chinese, phonology, dialects, such, as, lower, yangtze, and, minjiang, are, thus, said, to, have, five, tones, instead, of, four, however, modern, linguistics, considers, these, syllables, as, having, no, phonemic, tone, at, all, although, the, system, of, tones, is, common, across, mandarin, dialects, their, realization, as, tone, contours, varies, widely, dialects, in, and, around, the, nantong, area, typically, have, many, more, than, 4, tones, due, to, influence, from, the, neighbouring, wu, dialects, mandarin, dialects, frequently, employ, neutral, tones, in, the, second, syllables, of, words, creating, syllables, whose, tone, contour, is, so, short, and, light, that, it, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, discriminate, these, atonal, syllables, also, occur, in, non, mandarin, dialects, but, in, many, southern, dialects, the, tones, of, all, syllables, are, made, clear, there, are, more, polysyllabic, words, in, mandarin, than, in, all, other, major, varieties, of, chinese, except, shanghainese, this, is, partly, because, mandarin, has, undergone, many, more, sound, changes, than, southern, varieties, of, chinese, have, and, needed, to, deal, with, many, more, homophones, new, words, have, been, formed, by, adding, affixes, such, as, lao, zi, e, r, and, tou, or, by, compounding, e, g, by, combining, two, words, of, similar, meaning, as, in, c, ngm, ng, made, from, elements, meaning, hurried, and, busy, a, distinctive, feature, of, southwestern, mandarin, is, its, frequent, use, of, noun, reduplication, which, is, hardly, used, in, beijing, in, sichuan, one, hears, b, ob, o, handbag, where, beijing, uses, b, or, there, are, also, a, small, number, of, words, that, have, been, polysyllabic, since, old, chinese, such, as, h, di, butterfly, the, singular, pronouns, in, mandarin, are, w, i, n, or, you, n, n, you, formal, and, t, or, he, she, it, with, men, added, for, the, plural, further, there, is, a, distinction, between, the, plural, first, person, pronoun, z, nmen, which, is, inclusive, of, the, listener, and, w, men, which, may, be, exclusive, of, the, listener, dialects, of, mandarin, agree, with, each, other, quite, consistently, on, these, pronouns, while, the, first, and, second, person, singular, pronouns, are, cognate, with, forms, in, other, varieties, of, chinese, the, rest, of, the, pronominal, system, is, a, mandarin, innovation, e, g, shanghainese, has, non, you, and, yi, he, she, because, of, contact, with, mongolian, and, manchurian, peoples, mandarin, especially, the, northeastern, varieties, has, some, loanwords, from, these, languages, not, present, in, other, varieties, of, chinese, such, as, h, t, ng, alley, southern, chinese, varieties, have, borrowed, from, tai, austroasiatic, and, austronesian, languages, there, are, also, many, chinese, words, which, come, from, foreign, languages, such, as, g, o, rf, from, golf, b, j, n, from, bikini, and, h, nb, o, b, o, from, hamburger, in, general, the, greatest, variation, occurs, in, slang, in, kinship, terms, in, names, for, common, crops, and, domesticated, animals, for, common, verbs, and, adjectives, and, other, such, everyday, terms, the, least, variation, occurs, in, formal, vocabulary, terms, dealing, with, science, law, or, government, chinese, varieties, of, all, periods, are, considered, prime, examples, of, analytic, languages, relying, on, word, order, and, particles, instead, of, inflection, or, affixes, to, provide, grammatical, information, such, as, person, number, tense, mood, or, case, although, modern, varieties, including, the, mandarin, dialects, use, a, small, number, of, particles, in, a, similar, fashion, to, suffixes, they, are, still, strongly, analytic, the, basic, word, order, of, subject, verb, object, is, common, across, chinese, dialects, but, there, are, variations, in, the, order, of, the, two, objects, of, ditransitive, sentences, in, northern, dialects, the, indirect, object, precedes, the, direct, object, as, in, english, for, example, in, the, standard, chinese, sentence, w, i, g, i, give, n, you, y, b, n, a, sh, book, w, g, i, n, y, b, n, sh, i, give, you, a, book, in, southern, dialects, as, well, as, many, southwestern, and, lower, yangtze, dialects, the, objects, occur, in, the, reverse, order, most, varieties, of, chinese, use, post, verbal, particles, to, indicate, aspect, but, the, particles, used, vary, most, mandarin, dialects, use, the, particle, le, to, indicate, the, perfective, aspect, and, zhe, for, the, progressive, aspect, other, chinese, varieties, tend, to, use, different, particles, e, g, cantonese, zo, 2, and, gan, 2, respectively, the, experiential, aspect, particle, guo, is, used, more, widely, except, in, southern, min, the, subordinative, particle, de, is, characteristic, of, mandarin, dialects, some, southern, dialects, and, a, few, lower, yangtze, dialects, preserve, an, older, pattern, of, subordination, without, a, marking, particle, while, in, others, a, classifier, fulfils, the, role, of, the, mandarin, particle, especially, in, conversational, chinese, sentence, final, particles, alter, the, inherent, meaning, of, a, sentence, like, much, vocabulary, particles, can, vary, a, great, deal, with, regards, to, the, locale, for, example, the, particle, ma, which, is, used, in, most, northern, dialects, to, denote, obviousness, or, contention, is, replaced, by, yo, in, southern, usage, some, characters, in, mandarin, can, be, combined, with, others, to, indicate, a, particular, meaning, just, like, prefix, and, suffix, in, english, for, example, the, suffix, er, which, means, the, person, who, is, doing, the, action, e, g, teacher, person, who, teaches, in, mandarin, the, character, has, the, same, function, it, is, combined, with, which, means, teach, to, form, the, word, teacher, list, of, several, common, chinese, prefixes, and, suffixes, from, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights,
