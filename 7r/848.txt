the, middle, class, refers, to, a, class, of, people, in, the, middle, of, a, social, hierarchy, often, defined, by, occupation, income, education, or, social, status, the, term, has, historically, been, associated, with, modernity, capitalism, and, political, debate, common, definitions, for, the, middle, class, range, from, the, middle, fifth, of, individuals, on, a, nation, s, income, ladder, to, everyone, but, the, poorest, and, wealthiest, 20, theories, like, paradox, of, interest, use, decile, groups, and, wealth, distribution, data, to, determine, the, size, and, wealth, share, of, the, middle, class, terminology, differs, in, the, united, states, where, the, term, middle, class, describes, people, who, in, other, countries, would, be, described, as, working, class, there, has, been, significant, global, middle, class, growth, over, time, in, february, 2009, the, economist, asserted, that, over, half, of, the, world, s, population, belonged, to, the, middle, class, as, a, result, of, rapid, growth, in, emerging, countries, it, characterized, the, middle, class, as, having, a, reasonable, amount, of, discretionary, income, and, defined, it, as, beginning, at, the, point, where, people, have, roughly, a, third, of, their, income, left, for, discretionary, spending, after, paying, for, basic, food, and, shelter, the, term, middle, class, is, first, attested, in, james, bradshaw, s, 1745, pamphlet, scheme, to, prevent, running, irish, wools, to, france, another, phrase, used, in, early, modern, europe, was, the, middling, sort, the, term, middle, class, has, had, several, and, sometimes, contradictory, meanings, friedrich, engels, saw, the, category, as, an, intermediate, social, class, between, the, nobility, and, the, peasantry, in, late, feudalist, society, while, the, nobility, owned, much, of, the, countryside, and, the, peasantry, worked, it, a, new, bourgeoisie, literally, town, dwellers, arose, around, mercantile, functions, in, the, city, in, france, the, middle, classes, helped, drive, the, french, revolution, this, middle, class, eventually, overthrew, the, ruling, monarchists, of, feudal, society, thus, becoming, the, new, ruling, class, or, bourgeoisie, in, the, new, capitalist, dominated, societies, the, modern, usage, of, the, term, middle, class, however, dates, to, the, 1913, uk, registrar, general, s, report, in, which, the, statistician, t, h, c, stevenson, identified, the, middle, class, as, those, falling, between, the, upper, class, and, the, working, class, the, middle, class, includes, professionals, managers, and, senior, civil, servants, the, chief, defining, characteristic, of, membership, in, the, middle, class, is, control, of, significant, human, capital, while, still, being, under, the, dominion, of, the, elite, upper, class, who, control, much, of, the, financial, and, legal, capital, in, the, world, within, capitalism, middle, class, initially, referred, to, the, bourgeoisie, later, with, the, further, differentiation, of, classes, as, capitalist, societies, developed, the, term, came, to, be, synonymous, with, the, term, petite, bourgeoisie, the, boom, and, bust, cycles, of, capitalist, economies, result, in, the, periodic, and, more, or, less, temporary, impoverishment, and, proletarianization, of, much, of, the, petite, bourgeois, world, resulting, in, their, moving, back, and, forth, between, working, class, and, petite, bourgeois, status, the, typical, modern, definitions, of, middle, class, tend, to, ignore, the, fact, that, the, classical, petite, bourgeoisie, is, and, has, always, been, the, owner, of, a, small, to, medium, sized, business, whose, income, is, derived, almost, exclusively, from, the, employment, of, workers, middle, class, came, to, refer, to, the, combination, of, the, labour, aristocracy, professionals, and, salaried, white, collar, workers, the, size, of, the, middle, class, depends, on, how, it, is, defined, whether, by, education, wealth, environment, of, upbringing, social, network, manners, or, values, etc, these, are, all, related, but, are, far, from, deterministically, dependent, the, following, factors, are, often, ascribed, in, the, literature, on, this, topic, to, a, middle, class, in, the, united, states, by, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, more, people, identified, themselves, as, middle, class, with, insignificant, numbers, identifying, themselves, as, upper, class, the, labour, party, in, the, uk, which, grew, out, of, the, organised, labour, movement, and, originally, drew, almost, all, of, its, support, from, the, working, class, reinvented, itself, under, tony, blair, in, the, 1990s, as, new, labour, a, party, competing, with, the, conservative, party, for, the, votes, of, the, middle, class, as, well, as, those, of, the, labour, party, s, traditional, group, of, voters, the, working, class, around, 40, of, british, people, consider, themselves, to, be, middle, class, and, this, number, has, remained, relatively, stable, over, the, last, few, decades, according, to, the, oecd, the, middle, class, refers, to, households, with, income, between, 75, and, 200, of, the, median, national, income, marxism, defines, social, classes, according, to, their, relationship, with, the, means, of, production, the, main, basis, of, social, class, division, of, marxism, the, possession, of, means, of, production, the, role, and, position, it, plays, in, social, labor, organization, production, process, the, distribution, of, wealth, and, resources, and, the, amount, marxist, writers, have, used, the, term, middle, class, in, various, ways, in, the, first, sense, it, is, used, for, the, bourgeoisie, the, urban, merchant, and, professional, class, that, arose, between, the, aristocracy, and, the, proletariat, in, the, waning, years, of, feudalism, in, the, marxist, model, vladimir, lenin, stated, that, the, peasantry, in, russia, constitute, eight, or, nine, tenths, of, the, petty, bourgeoisie, however, in, modern, developed, countries, marxist, writers, define, the, petite, bourgeoisie, as, primarily, comprising, as, the, name, implies, owners, of, small, to, medium, sized, businesses, who, derive, their, income, from, the, exploitation, of, wage, laborers, and, who, are, in, turn, exploited, by, the, big, bourgeoisie, i, e, bankers, owners, of, large, corporate, trusts, etc, as, well, as, the, highly, educated, professional, class, of, doctors, engineers, architects, lawyers, university, professors, salaried, middle, management, of, capitalist, enterprises, of, all, sizes, etc, as, the, middle, class, which, stands, between, the, ruling, capitalist, owners, of, the, means, of, production, and, the, working, class, whose, income, is, derived, solely, from, hourly, wages, pioneer, 20th, century, american, marxist, theoretician, louis, c, fraina, lewis, corey, defined, the, middle, class, as, the, class, of, independent, small, enterprisers, owners, of, productive, property, from, which, a, livelihood, is, derived, from, fraina, s, perspective, this, social, category, included, propertied, farmers, but, not, propertyless, tenant, farmers, middle, class, also, included, salaried, managerial, and, supervisory, employees, but, not, the, masses, of, propertyless, dependent, salaried, employees, fraina, speculated, that, the, entire, category, of, salaried, employees, might, be, adequately, described, as, a, new, middle, class, in, economic, terms, although, this, remained, a, social, grouping, in, which, most, of, whose, members, are, a, new, proletariat, in, 1977, barbara, ehrenreich, and, john, ehrenreich, defined, a, new, class, in, the, united, states, as, salaried, mental, workers, who, do, not, own, the, means, of, production, and, whose, major, function, in, the, social, division, of, labor, the, reproduction, of, capitalist, culture, and, capitalist, class, relations, the, ehrenreichs, named, this, group, the, professional, managerial, class, this, group, of, middle, class, professionals, is, distinguished, from, other, social, classes, by, their, training, and, education, typically, business, qualifications, and, university, degrees, with, example, occupations, including, academics, and, teachers, social, workers, engineers, accountants, managers, nurses, and, middle, level, administrators, the, ehrenreichs, developed, their, definition, from, studies, by, andr, gorz, serge, mallet, and, others, of, a, new, working, class, which, despite, education, and, a, perception, of, themselves, as, middle, class, were, part, of, the, working, class, because, they, did, not, own, the, means, of, production, and, were, wage, earners, paid, to, produce, a, piece, of, capital, the, professional, managerial, class, seek, higher, rank, status, and, salaries, and, tend, to, have, incomes, above, the, average, for, their, country, modern, definitions, of, the, term, middle, class, are, often, politically, motivated, and, vary, according, to, the, exigencies, of, political, purpose, which, they, were, conceived, to, serve, in, the, first, place, as, well, as, due, to, the, multiplicity, of, more, or, less, scientific, methods, used, to, measure, and, compare, wealth, between, modern, advanced, industrial, states, where, poverty, is, relatively, low, and, the, distribution, of, wealth, more, egalitarian, in, a, relative, sense, and, in, developing, countries, where, poverty, and, a, profoundly, unequal, distribution, of, wealth, crush, the, vast, majority, of, the, population, many, of, these, methods, of, comparison, have, been, harshly, criticised, for, example, economist, thomas, piketty, in, his, book, capital, in, the, twenty, first, century, describes, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, comparative, measures, of, wealth, across, the, globe, the, gini, coefficient, as, being, an, example, of, synthetic, indices, which, mix, very, different, things, such, as, inequality, with, respect, to, labor, and, capital, so, that, it, is, impossible, to, distinguish, clearly, among, the, multiple, dimensions, of, inequality, and, the, various, mechanisms, at, work, in, february, 2009, the, economist, asserted, that, over, half, the, world, s, population, now, belongs, to, the, middle, class, as, a, result, of, rapid, growth, in, emerging, countries, it, characterized, the, middle, class, as, having, a, reasonable, amount, of, discretionary, income, so, that, they, do, not, live, from, hand, to, mouth, as, the, poor, do, and, defined, it, as, beginning, at, the, point, where, people, have, roughly, a, third, of, their, income, left, for, discretionary, spending, after, paying, for, basic, food, and, shelter, this, allows, people, to, buy, consumer, goods, improve, their, health, care, and, provide, for, their, children, s, education, most, of, the, emerging, middle, class, consists, of, people, who, are, middle, class, by, the, standards, of, the, developing, world, but, not, the, developed, one, since, their, money, incomes, do, not, match, developed, country, levels, but, the, percentage, of, it, which, is, discretionary, does, by, this, definition, the, number, of, middle, class, people, in, asia, exceeded, that, in, the, west, sometime, around, 2007, or, 2008, the, economist, s, article, pointed, out, that, in, many, emerging, countries, the, middle, class, has, not, grown, incrementally, but, explosively, the, point, at, which, the, poor, start, entering, the, middle, class, by, the, millions, is, alleged, to, be, the, time, when, poor, countries, get, the, maximum, benefit, from, cheap, labour, through, international, trade, before, they, price, themselves, out, of, world, markets, for, cheap, goods, it, is, also, a, period, of, rapid, urbanization, when, subsistence, farmers, abandon, marginal, farms, to, work, in, factories, resulting, in, a, several, fold, increase, in, their, economic, productivity, before, their, wages, catch, up, to, international, levels, that, stage, was, reached, in, china, sometime, between, 1990, and, 2005, when, the, chinese, middle, class, grew, from, 15, to, 62, of, the, population, and, is, just, being, reached, in, india, now, the, economist, predicted, that, surge, across, the, poverty, line, should, continue, for, a, couple, of, decades, and, the, global, middle, class, will, grow, exponentially, between, now, and, 2030, based, on, the, rapid, growth, scholars, expect, the, global, middle, class, to, be, the, driving, force, for, sustainable, development, this, assumption, however, is, contested, see, below, as, the, american, middle, class, is, estimated, by, some, researchers, to, comprise, approximately, 45, of, the, population, the, economist, s, article, would, put, the, size, of, the, american, middle, class, below, the, world, average, this, difference, is, due, to, the, extreme, difference, in, definitions, between, the, economist, s, and, many, other, models, in, 2010, a, working, paper, by, the, oecd, asserted, that, 1, 8, billion, people, were, now, members, of, the, global, middle, class, credit, suisse, s, global, wealth, report, 2014, released, in, october, 2014, estimated, that, one, billion, adults, belonged, to, the, middle, class, with, wealth, anywhere, between, the, range, of, 10, 000, 100, 000, according, to, a, study, carried, out, by, the, pew, research, center, a, combined, 16, of, the, world, s, population, in, 2011, were, upper, middle, income, and, upper, income, an, april, 2019, oecd, report, said, that, the, millennial, generation, is, being, pushed, out, of, the, middle, class, throughout, the, western, world, since, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, china, s, middle, class, has, grown, by, significant, margins, according, to, the, center, for, strategic, and, international, studies, by, 2013, some, 420, million, people, or, 31, of, the, chinese, population, qualified, as, middle, class, based, on, the, world, bank, definition, of, middle, class, as, those, having, with, daily, spending, between, 10, and, 50, per, day, nearly, 40, of, the, chinese, population, were, considered, middle, class, as, of, 2017, china, s, middle, class, represents, a, significant, market, force, with, effects, extending, beyond, its, borders, the, promise, of, increased, prosperity, and, a, consumer, society, has, been, a, driving, force, behind, this, growth, while, also, suggesting, the, potential, for, political, changes, similar, to, those, seen, in, europe, and, north, america, however, it, s, important, to, note, that, the, chinese, middle, class, differs, substantially, from, its, western, counterparts, despite, its, growth, it, remains, a, relatively, small, group, profoundly, joined, with, the, chinese, state, this, unique, relationship, challenges, assumptions, about, its, role, in, political, change, criticisms, from, this, demographic, often, center, on, improving, efficiency, and, social, justice, within, the, existing, political, framework, rather, than, advocating, for, a, regime, change, estimates, vary, widely, on, the, number, of, middle, class, people, in, india, a, 1983, article, put, the, indian, middle, class, as, somewhere, between, 70, and, 100, million, according, to, one, study, the, middle, class, in, india, stood, at, between, 60, and, 80, million, by, 1990, according, to, the, economist, 78, million, of, india, s, population, are, considered, middle, class, as, of, 2017, if, defined, using, the, cutoff, of, those, making, more, than, 10, per, day, a, standard, used, by, the, india, s, national, council, of, applied, economic, research, if, including, those, with, incomes, between, 2, and, 10, per, day, the, number, increases, to, 604, million, this, was, termed, by, researchers, as, the, new, middle, class, measures, considered, include, geography, lifestyle, income, and, education, the, world, inequality, report, in, 2018, further, concluded, that, elites, i, e, the, top, 10, are, accumulating, wealth, at, a, greater, rate, than, the, middle, class, that, rather, than, growing, india, s, middle, class, may, be, shrinking, in, size, according, to, a, 2014, study, by, standard, bank, economist, simon, freemantle, a, total, of, 15, 3, million, households, in, 11, surveyed, nations, of, africa, are, middle, class, angola, ethiopia, ghana, kenya, mozambique, nigeria, south, sudan, sudan, tanzania, uganda, and, zambia, in, south, africa, a, report, conducted, by, the, institute, for, race, relations, in, 2015, estimated, that, between, 10, and, 20, of, south, africans, are, middle, class, based, on, various, criteria, an, earlier, study, estimated, that, in, 2008, 21, 3, of, south, africans, were, members, of, the, middle, class, a, study, by, eiu, canback, indicates, 90, of, africans, fall, below, an, income, of, 10, a, day, the, proportion, of, africans, in, the, 10, 20, middle, class, excluding, south, africa, rose, from, 4, 4, to, only, 6, 2, between, 2004, and, 2014, over, the, same, period, the, proportion, of, upper, middle, class, income, 20, 50, a, day, went, from, 1, 4, to, 2, 3, according, to, a, 2014, study, by, the, german, development, institute, the, middle, class, of, sub, saharan, africa, rose, from, 14, million, to, 31, million, people, between, 1990, and, 2010, over, the, years, estimates, on, the, size, of, the, latin, america, s, middle, class, have, varied, a, 1960, study, stated, that, the, middle, strata, in, latin, america, as, a, whole, exclusive, of, indians, constituted, just, under, 20, of, the, national, society, a, 1964, study, estimated, that, 45, million, latin, americans, belonged, to, the, urban, middle, class, while, 15, million, to, the, urban, well, to, do, and, 8, million, to, the, rural, middle, class, and, well, to, do, in, brazil, according, to, one, estimate, in, 1970, the, lower, middle, class, comprised, 12, of, the, population, while, the, upper, middle, class, comprised, 3, in, the, mid, 1970s, it, was, estimated, by, one, authority, that, the, brazilian, middle, class, comprised, between, 15, and, 25, of, the, population, a, 1969, economic, survey, estimated, that, 15, of, brazilians, belonged, to, the, middle, class, by, 1970, according, to, one, study, the, middle, class, of, argentina, comprised, 38, of, the, economically, active, population, compared, with, 19, in, brazil, and, 24, in, mexico, a, 1975, study, on, mexico, estimated, that, the, middle, class, in, 1968, defined, as, families, earning, between, 2, 000, and, 5, 000, pesos, annually, comprised, 36, 4, of, the, population, while, the, upper, class, defined, as, families, earning, over, 5, 000, pesos, annually, comprised, 9, 4, of, the, population, and, the, lower, class, defined, as, families, earning, less, than, 2, 000, pesos, annually, comprised, 53, 9, of, the, population, according, to, a, study, by, the, world, bank, the, number, of, latin, americans, who, are, middle, class, rose, from, 103, million, to, 152, million, between, 2003, and, 2009, in, 2012, the, middle, class, in, russia, was, estimated, as, 15, of, the, whole, population, due, to, sustainable, growth, the, pre, crisis, level, was, exceeded, in, 2015, research, from, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, estimated, that, around, 15, of, the, russian, population, are, firmly, middle, class, while, around, another, 25, are, on, the, periphery
