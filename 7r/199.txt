his, baltimore, estate, clifton, when, gilman, assumed, the, presidency, he, decided, that, it, would, be, best, to, use, the, university, s, endowment, for, recruiting, faculty, and, students, deciding, to, as, it, has, been, paraphrased, build, men, not, buildings, in, his, will, hopkins, stipulated, that, none, of, his, endowment, should, be, used, for, construction, only, interest, on, the, principal, could, be, used, for, this, purpose, unfortunately, stocks, in, the, baltimore, and, ohio, railroad, which, would, have, generated, most, of, the, interest, became, virtually,
