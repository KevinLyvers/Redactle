gestalt, psychology, gestaltism, or, configurationism, is, a, school, of, psychology, and, a, theory, of, perception, that, emphasises, the, processing, of, entire, patterns, and, configurations, and, not, merely, individual, components, it, emerged, in, the, early, twentieth, century, in, austria, and, germany, as, a, rejection, of, basic, principles, of, wilhelm, wundt, s, and, edward, titchener, s, elementalist, and, structuralist, psychology, gestalt, psychology, is, often, associated, with, the, adage, the, whole, is, greater, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, in, gestalt, theory, information, is, perceived, as, wholes, rather, than, disparate, parts, which, are, then, processed, summatively, as, used, in, gestalt, psychology, the, german, word, gestalt, t, l, t, t, l, t, g, shta, h, lt, german, meaning, form, is, interpreted, as, pattern, or, configuration, it, differs, from, gestalt, therapy, which, is, only, peripherally, linked, to, gestalt, psychology, max, wertheimer, kurt, koffka, and, wolfgang, k, hler, founded, gestalt, psychology, in, the, early, 20th, century, 113, 116, the, dominant, view, in, psychology, at, the, time, was, structuralism, exemplified, by, the, work, of, hermann, von, helmholtz, wilhelm, wundt, and, edward, b, titchener, 3, structuralism, was, rooted, firmly, in, british, empiricism, 3, and, was, based, on, three, closely, interrelated, theories, together, these, three, theories, give, rise, to, the, view, that, the, mind, constructs, all, perceptions, and, abstract, thoughts, strictly, from, lower, level, sensations, which, are, related, solely, by, being, associated, closely, in, space, and, time, the, gestaltists, took, issue, with, the, widespread, atomistic, view, that, the, aim, of, psychology, should, be, to, break, consciousness, down, into, putative, basic, elements, in, contrast, the, gestalt, psychologists, believed, that, breaking, psychological, phenomena, down, into, smaller, parts, would, not, lead, to, understanding, psychology, 13, instead, they, viewed, psychological, phenomena, as, organized, structured, wholes, 13, they, argued, that, the, psychological, whole, has, priority, and, that, the, parts, are, defined, by, the, structure, of, the, whole, rather, than, the, other, way, round, gestalt, theories, of, perception, are, based, on, human, nature, being, inclined, to, understand, objects, as, an, entire, structure, rather, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, wertheimer, had, been, a, student, of, austrian, philosopher, christian, von, ehrenfels, a, member, of, the, school, of, brentano, von, ehrenfels, introduced, the, concept, of, gestalt, to, philosophy, and, psychology, in, 1890, before, the, advent, of, gestalt, psychology, as, such, von, ehrenfels, observed, that, a, perceptual, experience, such, as, perceiving, a, melody, or, a, shape, is, more, than, the, sum, of, its, sensory, components, he, claimed, that, in, addition, to, the, sensory, elements, of, the, perception, there, is, something, additional, that, is, an, element, in, its, own, right, despite, in, some, sense, being, derived, from, the, organization, of, the, component, sensory, elements, he, called, it, gestalt, qualit, t, or, form, quality, it, is, this, gestalt, qualit, t, that, according, to, von, ehrenfels, allows, a, tune, to, be, transposed, to, a, new, key, using, completely, different, notes, while, still, retaining, its, identity, the, idea, of, a, gestalt, qualit, t, has, roots, in, theories, by, david, hume, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, immanuel, kant, david, hartley, and, ernst, mach, both, von, ehrenfels, and, edmund, husserl, seem, to, have, been, inspired, by, mach, s, work, beitr, ge, zur, analyse, der, empfindungen, contributions, to, the, analysis, of, sensations, 1886, in, formulating, their, very, similar, concepts, of, gestalt, and, figural, moment, respectively, by, 1914, the, first, published, references, to, gestalt, theory, could, be, found, in, a, footnote, of, gabriele, von, wartensleben, s, application, of, gestalt, theory, to, personality, she, was, a, student, at, frankfurt, academy, for, social, sciences, who, interacted, deeply, with, wertheimer, and, k, hler, through, a, series, of, experiments, wertheimer, discovered, that, a, person, observing, a, pair, of, alternating, bars, of, light, can, under, the, right, conditions, experience, the, illusion, of, movement, between, one, location, and, the, other, he, noted, that, this, was, a, perception, of, motion, absent, any, moving, object, that, is, it, was, pure, phenomenal, motion, he, dubbed, it, phi, phenomenal, motion, wertheimer, s, publication, of, these, results, in, 1912, marks, the, beginning, of, gestalt, psychology, in, comparison, to, von, ehrenfels, and, others, who, had, used, the, term, gestalt, earlier, in, various, ways, wertheimer, s, unique, contribution, was, to, insist, that, the, gestalt, is, perceptually, primary, the, gestalt, defines, the, parts, from, which, it, is, composed, rather, than, being, a, secondary, quality, that, emerges, from, those, parts, wertheimer, took, the, more, radical, position, that, one, hears, the, melody, first, and, only, then, may, perceptually, divide, it, up, into, notes, similarly, in, vision, one, sees, the, form, of, the, circle, first, with, its, apprehension, not, mediated, by, a, process, of, part, summation, only, after, this, primary, apprehension, might, one, notice, that, it, is, made, up, of, lines, or, dots, or, stars, the, two, men, who, served, as, wertheimer, s, subjects, in, the, phi, experiments, were, k, hler, and, koffka, k, hler, was, an, expert, in, physical, acoustics, having, studied, under, physicist, max, planck, but, had, taken, his, degree, in, psychology, under, carl, stumpf, koffka, was, also, a, student, of, stumpf, s, having, studied, movement, phenomena, and, psychological, aspects, of, rhythm, in, 1917, k, hler, published, the, results, of, four, years, of, research, on, learning, in, chimpanzees, k, hler, showed, contrary, to, the, claims, of, most, other, learning, theorists, that, animals, can, learn, by, sudden, insight, into, the, structure, of, a, problem, over, and, above, the, associative, and, incremental, manner, of, learning, that, ivan, pavlov, and, edward, lee, thorndike, had, demonstrated, with, dogs, and, cats, respectively, in, 1921, koffka, published, a, gestalt, oriented, text, on, developmental, psychology, growth, of, the, mind, with, the, help, of, american, psychologist, robert, ogden, koffka, introduced, the, gestalt, point, of, view, to, an, american, audience, in, 1922, by, way, of, a, paper, in, psychological, bulletin, it, contains, criticisms, of, then, current, explanations, of, a, number, of, problems, of, perception, and, the, alternatives, offered, by, the, gestalt, school, koffka, moved, to, the, united, states, in, 1924, eventually, settling, at, smith, college, in, 1927, in, 1935, koffka, published, his, principles, of, gestalt, psychology, this, textbook, laid, out, the, gestalt, vision, of, the, scientific, enterprise, as, a, whole, science, he, said, is, not, the, simple, accumulation, of, facts, what, makes, research, scientific, is, the, incorporation, of, facts, into, a, theoretical, structure, the, goal, of, the, gestaltists, was, to, integrate, the, facts, of, inanimate, nature, life, and, mind, into, a, single, scientific, structure, this, meant, that, science, would, have, to, accommodate, not, only, what, koffka, called, the, quantitative, facts, of, physical, science, but, the, facts, of, two, other, scientific, categories, questions, of, order, and, questions, of, sinn, a, german, word, which, has, been, variously, translated, as, significance, value, and, meaning, without, incorporating, the, meaning, of, experience, and, behavior, koffka, believed, that, science, would, doom, itself, to, trivialities, in, its, investigation, of, human, beings, having, survived, the, nazis, up, to, the, mid, 1930s, all, the, core, members, of, the, gestalt, movement, were, forced, out, of, germany, to, the, united, states, by, 1935, k, hler, published, another, book, dynamics, in, psychology, in, 1940, but, thereafter, the, gestalt, movement, suffered, a, series, of, setbacks, koffka, died, in, 1941, and, wertheimer, in, 1943, wertheimer, s, long, awaited, book, on, mathematical, problem, solving, productive, thinking, was, published, posthumously, in, 1945, but, k, hler, was, left, to, guide, the, movement, without, his, two, long, time, colleagues, gestalt, psychology, differs, from, gestalt, therapy, which, is, only, peripherally, linked, to, gestalt, psychology, the, founders, of, gestalt, therapy, fritz, and, laura, perls, had, worked, with, kurt, goldstein, a, neurologist, who, had, applied, principles, of, gestalt, psychology, to, the, functioning, of, the, organism, laura, perls, had, been, a, gestalt, psychologist, before, she, became, a, psychoanalyst, and, before, she, began, developing, gestalt, therapy, together, with, fritz, perls, the, extent, to, which, gestalt, psychology, influenced, gestalt, therapy, is, disputed, on, one, hand, laura, perls, preferred, not, to, use, the, term, gestalt, to, name, the, emerging, new, therapy, because, she, thought, that, the, gestalt, psychologists, would, object, to, it, on, the, other, hand, fritz, and, laura, perls, clearly, adopted, some, of, goldstein, s, work, mary, henle, noted, in, her, presidential, address, to, division, 24, at, the, meeting, of, the, american, psychological, association, what, perls, has, done, has, been, to, take, a, few, terms, from, gestalt, psychology, stretch, their, meaning, beyond, recognition, mix, them, with, notions, often, unclear, and, often, incompatible, from, the, depth, psychologies, existentialism, and, common, sense, and, he, has, called, the, whole, mixture, gestalt, therapy, his, work, has, no, substantive, relation, to, scientific, gestalt, psychology, to, use, his, own, language, fritz, perls, has, done, his, thing, whatever, it, is, it, is, not, gestalt, psychology, one, form, of, psychotherapy, that, unlike, gestalt, therapy, is, actually, consistently, based, on, gestalt, psychology, is, gestalt, theoretical, psychotherapy, the, gestalt, psychologists, practiced, a, set, of, theoretical, and, methodological, principles, that, attempted, to, redefine, the, approach, to, psychological, research, this, is, in, contrast, to, investigations, developed, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, based, on, traditional, scientific, methodology, which, divided, the, object, of, study, into, a, set, of, elements, that, could, be, analyzed, separately, with, the, objective, of, reducing, the, complexity, of, this, object, the, principle, of, totality, asserts, that, conscious, experience, must, be, considered, globally, by, taking, into, account, all, the, physical, and, mental, aspects, of, the, individual, simultaneously, because, the, nature, of, the, mind, demands, that, each, component, be, considered, as, part, of, a, system, of, dynamic, relationships, thus, holism, as, fundamental, aspect, of, gestalt, psychology, moreover, the, perception, of, the, nature, of, a, part, depends, upon, the, whole, in, which, it, is, embedded, the, maxim, that, the, whole, is, more, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, is, not, a, precise, description, of, the, gestaltist, view, rather, as, koffka, writes, the, whole, is, something, else, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, because, summing, is, a, meaningless, procedure, whereas, the, whole, part, relationship, is, meaningful, the, principle, of, psychophysical, isomorphism, hypothesizes, that, there, is, a, correlation, between, conscious, experience, and, cerebral, activity, based, on, the, principles, phenomenon, experimental, analysis, was, derived, which, asserts, that, any, psychological, research, should, take, phenomena, as, a, starting, point, and, not, be, solely, focused, on, sensory, qualities, a, related, principle, is, that, of, the, biotic, experiment, which, establishes, the, need, to, conduct, real, experiments, that, sharply, contrasted, with, and, opposed, classic, laboratory, experiments, this, signified, experimenting, in, natural, situations, developed, in, real, conditions, in, which, it, would, be, possible, to, reproduce, with, higher, fidelity, what, would, be, habitual, for, a, subject, the, gestaltists, were, the, first, to, document, and, demonstrate, empirically, many, facts, about, perception, including, facts, about, the, perception, of, movement, the, perception, of, contour, perceptual, constancy, and, perceptual, illusions, wertheimer, s, discovery, of, the, phi, phenomenon, is, one, example, of, such, a, contribution, the, key, principles, of, gestalt, systems, are, emergence, reification, multistability, and, invariance, these, principles, are, not, necessarily, separable, modules, to, model, individually, but, they, could, be, different, aspects, of, a, single, unified, dynamic, mechanism, reification, is, the, constructive, or, generative, aspect, of, perception, by, which, the, experienced, object, of, perception, contains, more, explicit, spatial, information, than, the, sensory, stimulus, on, which, it, is, based, for, instance, a, triangle, is, perceived, in, picture, a, though, no, triangle, is, there, in, pictures, b, and, d, the, eye, recognizes, disparate, shapes, as, belonging, to, a, single, shape, in, c, a, complete, three, dimensional, shape, is, seen, where, in, actuality, no, such, thing, is, drawn, reification, can, be, explained, by, progress, in, the, study, of, illusory, contours, which, are, treated, by, the, visual, system, as, real, contours, multistability, or, multistable, perception, is, the, tendency, of, ambiguous, perceptual, experiences, to, pop, back, and, forth, between, two, or, more, alternative, interpretations, this, is, seen, for, example, in, the, necker, cube, and, rubin, s, figure, vase, illusion, other, examples, include, the, three, legged, blivet, artist, m, c, escher, s, artwork, and, the, appearance, of, flashing, marquee, lights, moving, first, one, direction, and, then, suddenly, the, other, invariance, is, the, property, of, perception, whereby, simple, geometrical, objects, are, recognized, independent, of, rotation, translation, and, scale, as, well, as, several, other, variations, such, as, elastic, deformations, different, lighting, and, different, component, features, for, example, the, objects, in, a, in, the, figure, are, all, immediately, recognized, as, the, same, basic, shape, which, is, immediately, distinguishable, from, the, forms, in, b, they, are, even, recognized, despite, perspective, and, elastic, deformations, as, in, c, and, when, depicted, using, different, graphic, elements, as, in, d, computational, theories, of, vision, such, as, those, by, david, marr, have, provided, alternate, explanations, of, how, perceived, objects, are, classified, like, figure, ground, organization, perceptual, grouping, sometimes, called, perceptual, segregation, is, a, form, of, perceptual, organization, perceptual, grouping, is, the, process, that, determines, how, organisms, perceive, some, parts, of, their, perceptual, fields, as, being, more, related, than, others, using, such, information, for, object, detection, the, gestaltists, were, the, first, psychologists, to, systematically, study, perceptual, grouping, according, to, gestalt, psychologists, the, fundamental, principle, of, perceptual, grouping, is, the, law, of, pr, gnanz, also, known, as, the, law, of, good, gestalt, pr, gnanz, is, a, german, word, that, directly, translates, to, pithiness, and, implies, salience, conciseness, and, orderliness, the, law, of, pr, gnanz, says, that, people, tend, to, experience, things, as, regular, orderly, symmetrical, and, simple, gestalt, psychologists, attempted, to, discover, refinements, of, the, law, of, pr, gnanz, which, involved, writing, down, laws, that, predict, the, interpretation, of, sensation, wertheimer, defined, a, few, principles, that, explain, the, ways, humans, perceive, objects, based, on, similarity, proximity, and, continuity, the, law, of, proximity, states, that, when, an, individual, perceives, an, assortment, of, objects, they, perceive, objects, that, are, close, to, each, other, as, forming, a, group, for, example, in, the, figure, illustrating, the, law, of, proximity, there, are, 72, circles, but, we, perceive, the, collection, of, circles, in, groups, specifically, we, perceive, that, there, is, a, group, of, 36, circles, on, the, left, side, of, the, image, and, three, groups, of, 12, circles, on, the, right, side, of, the, image, this, law, is, often, used, in, advertising, logos, to, emphasize, which, aspects, of, events, are, associated, the, law, of, similarity, states, that, elements, within, an, assortment, of, objects, are, perceptually, grouped, together, if, they, are, similar, to, each, other, this, similarity, can, occur, in, the, form, of, shape, colour, shading, or, other, qualities, for, example, the, figure, illustrating, the, law, of, similarity, portrays, 36, circles, all, equal, distance, apart, from, one, another, forming, a, square, in, this, depiction, 18, of, the, circles, are, shaded, dark, and, 18, of, the, circles, are, shaded, light, we, perceive, the, dark, circles, as, grouped, together, and, the, light, circles, as, grouped, together, forming, six, horizontal, lines, within, the, square, of, circles, this, perception, of, lines, is, due, to, the, law, of, similarity, gestalt, psychologists, believed, that, humans, tend, to, perceive, objects, as, complete, rather, than, focusing, on, the, gaps, that, the, object, might, contain, for, example, a, circle, has, good, gestalt, in, terms, of, completeness, however, we, will, also, perceive, an, incomplete, circle, as, a, complete, circle, that, tendency, to, complete, shapes, and, figures, is, called, closure, the, law, of, closure, states, that, individuals, perceive, objects, such, as, shapes, letters, pictures, etc, as, being, whole, when, they, are, not, complete, specifically, when, parts, of, a, whole, picture, are, missing, our, perception, fills, in, the, visual, gap, research, shows, that, the, reason, the, mind, completes, a, regular, figure, that, is, not, perceived, through, sensation, is, to, increase, the, regularity, of, surrounding, stimuli, for, example, the, figure, that, depicts, the, law, of, closure, portrays, what, we, perceive, as, a, circle, on, the, left, side, of, the, image, and, a, rectangle, on, the, right, side, of, the, image, however, gaps, are, present, in, the, shapes, if, the, law, of, closure, did, not, exist, the, image, would, depict, an, assortment, of, different, lines, with, different, lengths, rotations, and, curvatures, but, with, the, law, of, closure, we, perceptually, combine, the, lines, into, whole, shapes, the, law, of, symmetry, states, that, the, mind, perceives, objects, as, being, symmetrical, and, forming, around, a, center, point, it, is, perceptually, pleasing, to, divide, objects, into, an, even, number, of, symmetrical, parts, therefore, when, two, symmetrical, elements, are, unconnected, the, mind, perceptually, connects, them, to, form, a, coherent, shape, similarities, between, symmetrical, objects, increase, the, likelihood, that, objects, are, grouped, to, form, a, combined, symmetrical, object, for, example, the, figure, depicting, the, law, of, symmetry, shows, a, configuration, of, square, and, curled, brackets, when, the, image, is, perceived, we, tend, to, observe, three, pairs, of, symmetrical, brackets, rather, than, six, individual, brackets, the, law, of, common, fate, states, that, objects, are, perceived, as, lines, that, move, along, the, smoothest, path, experiments, using, the, visual, sensory, modality, found, that, the, movement, of, elements, of, an, object, produces, paths, that, individuals, perceive, that, the, objects, are, on, we, perceive, elements, of, objects, to, have, trends, of, motion, which, indicate, the, path, that, the, object, is, on, the, law, of, continuity, implies, the, grouping, together, of, objects, that, have, the, same, trend, of, motion, and, are, therefore, on, the, same, path, for, example, if, there, is, an, array, of, dots, and, half, the, dots, are, moving, upward, while, the, other, half, are, moving, downward, we, would, perceive, the, upward, moving, dots, and, the, downward, moving, dots, as, two, distinct, units, the, law, of, continuity, also, known, as, the, law, of, good, continuation, states, that, elements, of, objects, tend, to, be, grouped, together, and, therefore, integrated, into, perceptual, wholes, if, they, are, aligned, within, an, object, in, cases, where, there, is, an, intersection, between, objects, individuals, tend, to, perceive, the, two, objects, as, two, single, uninterrupted, entities, stimuli, remain, distinct, even, with, overlap, we, are, less, likely, to, group, elements, with, sharp, abrupt, directional, changes, as, being, one, object, for, example, the, figure, depicting, the, law, of, continuity, shows, a, configuration, of, two, crossed, keys, when, the, image, is, perceived, we, tend, to, perceive, the, key, in, the, background, as, a, single, uninterrupted, key, instead, of, two, separate, halves, of, a, key, the, law, of, past, experience, implies, that, under, some, circumstances, visual, stimuli, are, categorized, according, to, past, experience, if, objects, tend, to, be, observed, within, close, proximity, or, small, temporal, intervals, the, objects, are, more, likely, to, be, perceived, together, for, example, the, english, language, contains, 26, letters, that, are, grouped, to, form, words, using, a, set, of, rules, if, an, individual, reads, an, english, word, they, have, never, seen, they, use, the, law, of, past, experience, to, interpret, the, letters, l, and, i, as, two, letters, beside, each, other, rather, than, using, the, law, of, closure, to, combine, the, letters, and, interpret, the, object, as, an, uppercase, u, an, example, of, the, gestalt, movement, in, effect, as, it, is, both, a, process, and, result, is, a, music, sequence, people, are, able, to, recognise, a, sequence, of, perhaps, six, or, seven, notes, despite, them, being, transposed, into, a, different, tuning, or, key, an, early, theory, of, gestalt, grouping, principles, in, music, was, composer, theorist, james, tenney, s, meta, hodos, 1961, auditory, scene, analysis, as, developed, by, albert, bregman, further, extends, a, gestalt, approach, to, the, analysis, of, sound, perception, figure, ground, organization, is, a, form, of, perceptual, organization, which, interprets, perceptual, elements, in, terms, of, their, shapes, and, relative, locations, in, the, layout, of, surfaces, in, the, 3, d, world, figure, ground, organization, structures, the, perceptual, field, into, a, figure, standing, out, at, the, front, of, the, perceptual, field, and, a, background, receding, behind, the, figure, pioneering, work, on, figure, ground, organization, was, carried, out, by, the, danish, psychologist, edgar, rubin, the, gestalt, psychologists, demonstrated, that, people, tend, to, perceive, as, figures, those, parts, of, our, perceptual, fields, that, are, convex, symmetric, small, and, enclosed, gestalt, psychology, contributed, to, the, scientific, study, of, problem, solving, in, fact, the, early, experimental, work, of, the, gestaltists, in, germany, marks, the, beginning, of, the, scientific, study, of, problem, solving, later, this, experimental, work, continued, through, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, with, research, conducted, on, relatively, simple, laboratory, tasks, of, problem, solving, max, wertheimer, distinguished, two, kinds, of, thinking, productive, thinking, and, reproductive, thinking, 456, 361, productive, thinking, is, solving, a, problem, based, on, insight, a, quick, creative, unplanned, response, to, situations, and, environmental, interaction, reproductive, thinking, is, solving, a, problem, deliberately, based, on, previous, experience, and, knowledge, reproductive, thinking, proceeds, algorithmically, a, problem, solver, reproduces, a, series, of, steps, from, memory, knowing, that, they, will, lead, to, a, solution, or, by, trial, and, error, 361, karl, duncker, another, gestalt, psychologist, who, studied, problem, solving, 370, coined, the, term, functional, fixedness, for, describing, the, difficulties, in, both, visual, perception, and, problem, solving, that, arise, from, the, fact, that, one, element, of, a, whole, situation, already, has, a, fixed, function, that, has, to, be, changed, in, order, to, perceive, something, or, find, the, solution, to, a, problem, gestalt, psychology, struggled, to, precisely, define, terms, like, pr, gnanz, to, make, specific, behavioural, predictions, and, to, articulate, testable, models, of, underlying, neural, mechanisms, it, was, criticized, as, being, merely, descriptive, these, shortcomings, led, by, the, mid, 20th, century, to, growing, dissatisfaction, with, gestaltism, and, a, subsequent, decline, in, its, impact, on, psychology, despite, this, decline, gestalt, psychology, has, formed, the, basis, of, much, further, research, into, the, perception, of, patterns, and, objects, and, of, research, into, behaviour, thinking, problem, solving, and, psychopathology, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, laboratory, research, in, neurology, and, what, became, known, as, cybernetics, on, the, mechanism, of, frogs, eyes, indicate, that, perception, of, gestalts, in, particular, gestalts, in, motion, is, perhaps, more, primitive, and, fundamental, than, seeing, as, such, the, halo, effect, can, be, explained, through, the, application, of, gestalt, theories, to, social, information, processing, the, constructive, theories, of, social, cognition, are, applied, to, the, expectations, of, individuals, they, have, been, perceived, in, this, manner, and, the, person, judging, the, individual, is, continuing, to, view, them, in, this, positive, manner, gestalt, s, theories, of, perception, enforces, that, individual, s, tendency, to, perceive, actions, and, characteristics, as, a, whole, rather, than, isolated, parts, therefore, humans, are, inclined, to, build, a, coherent, and, consistent, impression, of, objects, and, behaviors, in, order, to, achieve, an, acceptable, shape, and, form, the, halo, effect, is, what, forms, patterns, for, individuals, the, halo, effect, being, classified, as, a, cognitive, bias, which, occurs, during, impression, formation, the, halo, effect, can, also, be, altered, by, physical, characteristics, social, status, and, many, other, characteristics, as, well, the, halo, effect, can, have, real, repercussions, on, the, individual, s, perception, of, reality, either, negatively, or, positively, meaning, to, construct, negative, or, positive, images, about, other, individuals, or, situations, something, that, could, lead, to, self, fulfilling, prophesies, stereotyping, or, even, discrimination, some, of, the, central, criticisms, of, gestaltism, are, based, on, the, preference, gestaltists, are, deemed, to, have, for, theory, over, data, and, a, lack, of, quantitative, research, supporting, gestalt, ideas, this, is, not, necessarily, a, fair, criticism, as, highlighted, by, a, recent, collection, of, quantitative, research, on, gestalt, perception, researchers, continue, to, test, hypotheses, about, the, mechanisms, underlying, gestalt, principles, such, as, the, principle, of, similarity, other, important, criticisms, concern, the, lack, of, definition, and, support, for, the, many, physiological, assumptions, made, by, gestaltists, and, lack, of, theoretical, coherence, in, modern, gestalt, psychology, in, some, scholarly, communities, such, as, cognitive, psychology, and, computational, neuroscience, gestalt, theories, of, perception, are, criticized, for, being, descriptive, rather, than, explanatory, in, nature, for, this, reason, they, are, viewed, by, some, as, redundant, or, uninformative, for, example, a, textbook, on, visual, perception, states, that, the, physiological, theory, of, the, gestaltists, has, fallen, by, the, wayside, leaving, us, with, a, set, of, descriptive, principles, but, without, a, model, of, perceptual, processing, indeed, some, of, their, laws, of, perceptual, organisation, today, sound, vague, and, inadequate, what, is, meant, by, a, good, or, simple, shape, for, example, one, historian, of, psychology, david, j, murray, has, argued, that, gestalt, psychologists, first, discovered, many, principles, later, championed, by, cognitive, psychology, including, schemas, and, prototypes, another, psychologist, has, argued, that, the, gestalt, psychologists, made, a, lasting, contribution, by, showing, how, the, study, of, illusions, can, help, scientists, understand, essential, aspects, of, how, the, visual, system, normally, functions, not, merely, how, it, breaks, down, 16, the, gestalt, laws, are, used, in, several, visual, design, fields, such, as, user, interface, design, and, cartography, the, laws, of, similarity, and, proximity, can, for, example, be, used, as, guides, for, placing, radio, buttons, they, may, also, be, used, in, designing, computers, and, software, for, more, intuitive, human, use, examples, include, the, design, and, layout, of, a, desktop, s, shortcuts, in, rows, and, columns, in, map, design, principles, of, pr, gnanz, or, grouping, are, crucial, for, implying, a, conceptual, order, to, the, portrayed, geographic, features, thus, facilitating, the, intended, use, of, the, map, the, law, of, similarity, is, employed, by, selecting, similar, map, symbols, for, similar, kinds, of, features, or, features, with, similar, properties, the, law, of, proximity, is, crucial, to, identifying, geographic, patterns, and, regions, and, the, laws, of, closure, and, continuity, allow, users, to, recognize, features, that, may, be, obscured, by, other, features, such, as, when, a, road, goes, over, a, river
