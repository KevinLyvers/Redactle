a, military, also, known, collectively, as, armed, forces, is, a, heavily, armed, highly, organized, force, primarily, intended, for, warfare, militaries, are, typically, authorized, and, maintained, by, a, sovereign, state, with, their, members, identifiable, by, a, distinct, military, uniform, they, may, consist, of, one, or, more, military, branches, such, as, an, army, navy, air, force, space, force, marines, or, coast, guard, the, main, task, of, a, military, is, usually, defined, as, defence, of, their, state, and, its, interests, against, external, armed, threats, in, broad, usage, the, terms, armed, forces, and, military, are, often, synonymous, although, in, technical, usage, a, distinction, is, sometimes, made, in, which, a, country, s, armed, forces, may, include, other, paramilitary, forces, such, as, armed, police, a, nation, s, military, may, function, as, a, discrete, social, subculture, with, dedicated, infrastructure, such, as, military, housing, schools, utilities, logistics, hospitals, legal, services, food, production, finance, and, banking, services, beyond, warfare, the, military, may, be, employed, in, additional, sanctioned, and, non, sanctioned, functions, within, the, state, including, internal, security, threats, crowd, control, promotion, of, political, agendas, emergency, services, and, reconstruction, protecting, corporate, economic, interests, social, ceremonies, and, national, honour, guards, the, profession, of, soldiering, is, older, than, recorded, history, some, images, of, classical, antiquity, portray, the, power, and, feats, of, military, leaders, the, battle, of, kadesh, in, 1274, bc, from, the, reign, of, ramses, ii, features, in, bas, relief, monuments, the, first, emperor, of, a, unified, china, qin, shi, huang, created, the, terracotta, army, to, represent, his, military, might, the, ancient, romans, wrote, many, treatises, and, writings, on, warfare, as, well, as, many, decorated, triumphal, arches, and, victory, columns, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, word, military, in, english, spelled, militarie, was, in, 1582, it, comes, from, the, latin, militaris, from, latin, miles, soldier, through, french, but, is, of, uncertain, etymology, one, suggestion, being, derived, from, mil, it, going, in, a, body, or, mass, as, a, noun, phrase, the, military, usually, refers, generally, to, a, country, s, armed, forces, or, sometimes, more, specifically, to, the, senior, officers, who, command, them, in, general, it, refers, to, the, physicality, of, armed, forces, their, personnel, equipment, and, the, physical, area, which, they, occupy, as, an, adjective, military, originally, referred, only, to, soldiers, and, soldiering, but, it, broadened, to, apply, to, land, forces, in, general, and, anything, to, do, with, their, profession, the, names, of, both, the, royal, military, academy, 1741, and, united, states, military, academy, 1802, reflect, this, however, at, about, the, time, of, the, napoleonic, wars, military, began, to, be, used, in, reference, to, armed, forces, as, a, whole, such, as, military, service, military, intelligence, and, military, history, as, such, it, now, connotes, any, activity, performed, by, armed, force, personnel, military, history, is, often, considered, to, be, the, history, of, all, conflicts, not, just, the, history, of, the, state, militaries, it, differs, somewhat, from, the, history, of, war, with, military, history, focusing, on, the, people, and, institutions, of, war, making, while, the, history, of, war, focuses, on, the, evolution, of, war, itself, in, the, face, of, changing, technology, governments, and, geography, military, history, has, a, number, of, facets, one, main, facet, is, to, learn, from, past, accomplishments, and, mistakes, so, as, to, more, effectively, wage, war, in, the, future, another, is, to, create, a, sense, of, military, tradition, which, is, used, to, create, cohesive, military, forces, still, another, is, to, learn, to, prevent, wars, more, effectively, human, knowledge, about, the, military, is, largely, based, on, both, recorded, and, oral, history, of, military, conflicts, war, their, participating, armies, and, navies, and, more, recently, air, forces, despite, the, growing, importance, of, military, technology, military, activity, depends, above, all, on, people, for, example, in, 2000, the, british, army, declared, man, is, still, the, first, weapon, of, war, the, military, organization, is, characterized, by, a, command, hierarchy, divided, by, military, rank, with, ranks, normally, grouped, in, descending, order, of, authority, as, officers, e, g, colonel, non, commissioned, officers, e, g, sergeant, and, personnel, at, the, lowest, rank, e, g, private, while, senior, officers, make, strategic, decisions, subordinated, military, personnel, soldiers, sailors, marines, or, airmen, fulfil, them, although, rank, titles, vary, by, military, branch, and, country, the, rank, hierarchy, is, common, to, all, state, armed, forces, worldwide, in, addition, to, their, rank, personnel, occupy, one, of, many, trade, roles, which, are, often, grouped, according, to, the, nature, of, the, role, s, military, tasks, on, combat, operations, combat, roles, e, g, infantry, combat, support, roles, e, g, combat, engineers, and, combat, service, support, roles, e, g, logistical, support, personnel, may, be, recruited, or, conscripted, depending, on, the, system, chosen, by, the, state, most, military, personnel, are, males, the, minority, proportion, of, female, personnel, varies, internationally, approximately, 3, in, india, 10, in, the, uk, 13, in, sweden, 16, in, the, us, and, 27, in, south, africa, while, two, thirds, of, states, now, recruit, or, conscript, only, adults, as, of, 2017, 50, states, still, relied, partly, on, children, under, the, age, of, 18, usually, aged, 16, or, 17, to, staff, their, armed, forces, whereas, recruits, who, join, as, officers, tend, to, be, upwardly, mobile, most, enlisted, personnel, have, a, childhood, background, of, relative, socio, economic, deprivation, for, example, after, the, us, suspended, conscription, in, 1973, the, military, disproportionately, attracted, african, american, men, men, from, lower, status, socioeconomic, backgrounds, men, who, had, been, in, nonacademic, high, school, programs, and, men, whose, high, school, grades, tended, to, be, low, however, a, study, released, in, 2020, on, the, socio, economic, backgrounds, of, u, s, armed, forces, personnel, suggests, that, they, are, at, parity, or, slightly, higher, than, the, civilian, population, with, respect, to, socio, economic, indicators, such, as, parental, income, parental, wealth, and, cognitive, abilities, the, study, found, that, technological, tactical, operational, and, doctrinal, changes, have, led, to, a, change, in, the, demand, for, personnel, furthermore, the, study, suggests, that, the, most, disadvantaged, socio, economic, groups, are, less, likely, to, meet, the, requirements, of, the, modern, u, s, military, the, obligations, of, military, employment, are, many, full, time, military, employment, normally, requires, a, minimum, period, of, service, of, several, years, between, two, and, six, years, is, typical, of, armed, forces, in, australia, the, uk, and, the, us, for, example, depending, on, role, branch, and, rank, some, armed, forces, allow, a, short, discharge, window, normally, during, training, when, recruits, may, leave, the, armed, force, as, of, right, alternatively, part, time, military, employment, known, as, reserve, service, allows, a, recruit, to, maintain, a, civilian, job, while, training, under, military, discipline, at, weekends, he, or, she, may, be, called, out, to, deploy, on, operations, to, supplement, the, full, time, personnel, complement, after, leaving, the, armed, forces, recruits, may, remain, liable, for, compulsory, return, to, full, time, military, employment, in, order, to, train, or, deploy, on, operations, military, law, introduces, offences, not, recognized, by, civilian, courts, such, as, absence, without, leave, awol, desertion, political, acts, malingering, behaving, disrespectfully, and, disobedience, see, for, example, offences, against, military, law, in, the, united, kingdom, penalties, range, from, a, summary, reprimand, to, imprisonment, for, several, years, following, a, court, martial, certain, rights, are, also, restricted, or, suspended, including, the, freedom, of, association, e, g, union, organizing, and, freedom, of, speech, speaking, to, the, media, military, personnel, in, some, countries, have, a, right, of, conscientious, objection, if, they, believe, an, order, is, immoral, or, unlawful, or, cannot, in, good, conscience, carry, it, out, personnel, may, be, posted, to, bases, in, their, home, country, or, overseas, according, to, operational, need, and, may, be, deployed, from, those, bases, on, exercises, or, operations, during, peacetime, when, military, personnel, are, generally, stationed, in, garrisons, or, other, permanent, military, facilities, they, conduct, administrative, tasks, training, and, education, activities, technology, maintenance, and, recruitment, initial, training, conditions, recruits, for, the, demands, of, military, life, including, preparedness, to, injure, and, kill, other, people, and, to, face, mortal, danger, without, fleeing, it, is, a, physically, and, psychologically, intensive, process, which, resocializes, recruits, for, the, unique, nature, of, military, demands, for, example, the, next, requirement, comes, as, a, fairly, basic, need, for, the, military, to, identify, possible, threats, it, may, be, called, upon, to, face, for, this, purpose, some, of, the, commanding, forces, and, other, military, as, well, as, often, civilian, personnel, participate, in, identification, of, these, threats, this, is, at, once, an, organization, a, system, and, a, process, collectively, called, military, intelligence, mi, areas, of, study, in, military, intelligence, may, include, the, operational, environment, hostile, friendly, and, neutral, forces, the, civilian, population, in, an, area, of, combat, operations, and, other, broader, areas, of, interest, the, difficulty, in, using, military, intelligence, concepts, and, military, intelligence, methods, is, in, the, nature, of, the, secrecy, of, the, information, they, seek, and, the, clandestine, nature, that, intelligence, operatives, work, in, obtaining, what, may, be, plans, for, a, conflict, escalation, initiation, of, combat, or, an, invasion, an, important, part, of, the, military, intelligence, role, is, the, military, analysis, performed, to, assess, military, capability, of, potential, future, aggressors, and, provide, combat, modelling, that, helps, to, understand, factors, on, which, comparison, of, forces, can, be, made, this, helps, to, quantify, and, qualify, such, statements, as, china, and, india, maintain, the, largest, armed, forces, in, the, world, or, that, the, u, s, military, is, considered, to, be, the, world, s, strongest, although, some, groups, engaged, in, combat, such, as, militants, or, resistance, movements, refer, to, themselves, using, military, terminology, notably, army, or, front, none, have, had, the, structure, of, a, national, military, to, justify, the, reference, and, usually, have, had, to, rely, on, support, of, outside, national, militaries, they, also, use, these, terms, to, conceal, from, the, mi, their, true, capabilities, and, to, impress, potential, ideological, recruits, having, military, intelligence, representatives, participate, in, the, execution, of, the, national, defence, policy, is, important, because, it, becomes, the, first, respondent, and, commentator, on, the, policy, expected, strategic, goal, compared, to, the, realities, of, identified, threats, when, the, intelligence, reporting, is, compared, to, the, policy, it, becomes, possible, for, the, national, leadership, to, consider, allocating, resources, over, and, above, the, officers, and, their, subordinates, military, pay, and, the, expense, of, maintaining, military, facilities, and, military, support, services, for, them, source, sipri, defense, economics, is, the, financial, and, monetary, efforts, made, to, resource, and, sustain, militaries, and, to, finance, military, operations, including, war, the, process, of, allocating, resources, is, conducted, by, determining, a, military, budget, which, is, administered, by, a, military, finance, organization, within, the, military, military, procurement, is, then, authorized, to, purchase, or, contract, provision, of, goods, and, services, to, the, military, whether, in, peacetime, at, a, permanent, base, or, in, a, combat, zone, from, local, population, capability, development, which, is, often, referred, to, as, the, military, strength, is, arguably, one, of, the, most, complex, activities, known, to, humanity, because, it, requires, determining, strategic, operational, and, tactical, capability, requirements, to, counter, the, identified, threats, strategic, operational, and, tactical, doctrines, by, which, the, acquired, capabilities, will, be, used, identifying, concepts, methods, and, systems, involved, in, executing, the, doctrines, creating, design, specifications, for, the, manufacturers, who, would, produce, these, in, adequate, quantity, and, quality, for, their, use, in, combat, purchase, the, concepts, methods, and, systems, create, a, forces, structure, that, would, use, the, concepts, methods, and, systems, most, effectively, and, efficiently, integrate, these, concepts, methods, and, systems, into, the, force, structure, by, providing, military, education, training, and, practice, that, preferably, resembles, combat, environment, of, intended, use, create, military, logistics, systems, to, allow, continued, and, uninterrupted, performance, of, military, organizations, under, combat, conditions, including, provision, of, health, services, to, the, personnel, and, maintenance, for, the, equipment, the, services, to, assist, recovery, of, wounded, personnel, and, repair, of, damaged, equipment, and, finally, post, conflict, demobilization, and, disposal, of, war, stocks, surplus, to, peacetime, requirements, development, of, military, doctrine, is, perhaps, the, most, important, of, all, capability, development, activities, because, it, determines, how, military, forces, are, used, in, conflicts, the, concepts, and, methods, used, by, the, command, to, employ, appropriately, military, skilled, armed, and, equipped, personnel, in, achievement, of, the, tangible, goals, and, objectives, of, the, war, campaign, battle, engagement, and, action, the, line, between, strategy, and, tactics, is, not, easily, blurred, although, deciding, which, is, being, discussed, had, sometimes, been, a, matter, of, personal, judgement, by, some, commentators, and, military, historians, the, use, of, forces, at, the, level, of, organization, between, strategic, and, tactical, is, called, operational, mobility, because, most, of, the, concepts, and, methods, used, by, the, military, and, many, of, its, systems, are, not, found, in, commercial, branches, much, of, the, material, is, researched, designed, developed, and, offered, for, inclusion, in, arsenals, by, military, science, organizations, within, the, overall, structure, of, the, military, therefore, military, scientists, can, be, found, interacting, with, all, arms, and, services, of, the, armed, forces, and, at, all, levels, of, the, military, hierarchy, of, command, although, concerned, with, research, into, military, psychology, particularly, combat, stress, and, how, it, affects, troop, morale, often, the, bulk, of, military, science, activities, is, directed, at, military, intelligence, technology, military, communications, and, improving, military, capability, through, research, the, design, development, and, prototyping, of, weapons, military, support, equipment, and, military, technology, in, general, is, also, an, area, in, which, much, effort, is, invested, it, includes, everything, from, global, communication, networks, and, aircraft, carriers, to, paint, and, food, possessing, military, capability, is, not, sufficient, if, this, capability, cannot, be, deployed, for, and, employed, in, combat, operations, to, achieve, this, military, logistics, are, used, for, the, logistics, management, and, logistics, planning, of, the, forces, military, supply, chain, management, the, consumables, and, capital, equipment, of, the, troops, although, mostly, concerned, with, the, military, transport, as, a, means, of, delivery, using, different, modes, of, transport, from, military, trucks, to, container, ships, operating, from, permanent, military, base, it, also, involves, creating, field, supply, dumps, at, the, rear, of, the, combat, zone, and, even, forward, supply, points, in, a, specific, unit, s, tactical, area, of, responsibility, these, supply, points, are, also, used, to, provide, military, engineering, services, such, as, the, recovery, of, defective, and, derelict, vehicles, and, weapons, maintenance, of, weapons, in, the, field, the, repair, and, field, modification, of, weapons, and, equipment, and, in, peacetime, the, life, extension, programmes, undertaken, to, allow, continued, use, of, equipment, one, of, the, most, important, role, of, logistics, is, the, supply, of, munitions, as, a, primary, type, of, consumable, their, storage, and, disposal, the, primary, reason, for, the, existence, of, the, military, is, to, engage, in, combat, should, it, be, required, to, do, so, by, the, national, defence, policy, and, to, win, this, represents, an, organisational, goal, of, any, military, and, the, primary, focus, for, military, thought, through, military, history, how, victory, is, achieved, and, what, shape, it, assumes, is, studied, by, most, if, not, all, military, groups, on, three, levels, military, strategy, is, the, management, of, forces, in, wars, and, military, campaigns, by, a, commander, in, chief, employing, large, military, forces, either, national, and, allied, as, a, whole, or, the, component, elements, of, armies, navies, and, air, forces, such, as, army, groups, naval, fleets, and, large, numbers, of, aircraft, military, strategy, is, a, long, term, projection, of, belligerents, policy, with, a, broad, view, of, outcome, implications, including, outside, the, concerns, of, military, command, military, strategy, is, more, concerned, with, the, supply, of, war, and, planning, than, management, of, field, forces, and, combat, between, them, the, scope, of, strategic, military, planning, can, span, weeks, but, is, more, often, months, or, even, years, operational, mobility, is, within, warfare, and, military, doctrine, the, level, of, command, which, coordinates, the, minute, details, of, tactics, with, the, overarching, goals, of, strategy, a, common, synonym, is, operational, art, the, operational, level, is, at, a, scale, bigger, than, one, where, line, of, sight, and, the, time, of, day, are, important, and, smaller, than, the, strategic, level, where, production, and, politics, are, considerations, formations, are, of, the, operational, level, if, they, are, able, to, conduct, operations, on, their, own, and, are, of, sufficient, size, to, be, directly, handled, or, have, a, significant, impact, at, the, strategic, level, this, concept, was, pioneered, by, the, german, army, prior, to, and, during, the, second, world, war, at, this, level, planning, and, duration, of, activities, takes, from, one, week, to, a, month, and, are, executed, by, field, armies, and, army, corps, and, their, naval, and, air, equivalents, military, tactics, concerns, itself, with, the, methods, for, engaging, and, defeating, the, enemy, in, direct, combat, military, tactics, are, usually, used, by, units, over, hours, or, days, and, are, focused, on, the, specific, tasks, and, objectives, of, squadrons, companies, battalions, regiments, brigades, and, divisions, and, their, naval, and, air, force, equivalents, one, of, the, oldest, military, publications, is, the, art, of, war, by, the, chinese, philosopher, sun, tzu, written, in, the, 6th, century, bce, the, 13, chapter, book, is, intended, as, military, instruction, and, not, as, military, theory, but, has, had, a, huge, influence, on, asian, military, doctrine, and, from, the, late, 19th, century, on, european, and, united, states, military, planning, it, has, even, been, used, to, formulate, business, tactics, and, can, even, be, applied, in, social, and, political, areas, the, classical, greeks, and, the, romans, wrote, prolifically, on, military, campaigning, among, the, best, known, roman, works, are, julius, caesar, s, commentaries, on, the, gallic, wars, and, the, roman, civil, war, written, about, 50, bc, two, major, works, on, tactics, come, from, the, late, roman, period, taktike, theoria, by, aelianus, tacticus, and, de, re, militari, on, military, matters, by, vegetius, taktike, theoria, examined, greek, military, tactics, and, was, most, influential, in, the, byzantine, world, and, during, the, golden, age, of, islam, de, re, militari, formed, the, basis, of, european, military, tactics, until, the, late, 17th, century, perhaps, its, most, enduring, maxim, is, igitur, qui, desiderat, pacem, praeparet, bellum, let, he, who, desires, peace, prepare, for, war, due, to, the, changing, nature, of, combat, with, the, introduction, of, artillery, in, the, european, middle, ages, and, infantry, firearms, in, the, renaissance, attempts, were, made, to, define, and, identify, those, strategies, grand, tactics, and, tactics, that, would, produce, a, victory, more, often, than, that, achieved, by, the, romans, in, praying, to, the, gods, before, the, battle, later, this, became, known, as, military, science, and, later, still, would, adopt, the, scientific, method, approach, to, the, conduct, of, military, operations, under, the, influence, of, the, industrial, revolution, thinking, in, his, seminal, book, on, war, the, prussian, major, general, and, leading, expert, on, modern, military, strategy, carl, von, clausewitz, defined, military, strategy, as, the, employment, of, battles, to, gain, the, end, of, war, according, to, clausewitz, strategy, forms, the, plan, of, the, war, and, to, this, end, it, links, together, the, series, of, acts, which, are, to, lead, to, the, final, decision, that, is, to, say, it, makes, the, plans, for, the, separate, campaigns, and, regulates, the, combats, to, be, fought, in, each, hence, clausewitz, placed, political, aims, above, military, goals, ensuring, civilian, control, of, the, military, military, strategy, was, one, of, a, triumvirate, of, arts, or, sciences, that, governed, the, conduct, of, warfare, the, others, being, military, tactics, the, execution, of, plans, and, manoeuvring, of, forces, in, battle, and, maintenance, of, an, army, the, meaning, of, military, tactics, has, changed, over, time, from, the, deployment, and, manoeuvring, of, entire, land, armies, on, the, fields, of, ancient, battles, and, galley, fleets, to, modern, use, of, small, unit, ambushes, encirclements, bombardment, attacks, frontal, assaults, air, assaults, hit, and, run, tactics, used, mainly, by, guerrilla, forces, and, in, some, cases, suicide, attacks, on, land, and, at, sea, evolution, of, aerial, warfare, introduced, its, own, air, combat, tactics, often, military, deception, in, the, form, of, military, camouflage, or, misdirection, using, decoys, is, used, to, confuse, the, enemy, as, a, tactic, a, major, development, in, infantry, tactics, came, with, the, increased, use, of, trench, warfare, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, this, was, mainly, employed, in, world, war, i, in, the, gallipoli, campaign, and, the, western, front, trench, warfare, often, turned, to, a, stalemate, only, broken, by, a, large, loss, of, life, because, in, order, to, attack, an, enemy, entrenchment, soldiers, had, to, run, through, an, exposed, no, man, s, land, under, heavy, fire, from, their, opposing, entrenched, enemy, as, with, any, occupation, since, ancient, times, the, military, has, been, distinguished, from, other, members, of, the, society, by, their, tools, the, weapons, and, military, equipment, used, in, combat, when, stone, age, humans, first, took, flint, to, tip, the, spear, it, was, the, first, example, of, applying, technology, to, improve, the, weapon, since, then, the, advances, made, by, human, societies, and, that, of, weapons, has, been, closely, linked, stone, weapons, gave, way, to, bronze, age, and, iron, age, weapons, such, as, swords, and, shields, with, each, technological, change, was, realized, some, tangible, increase, in, military, capability, such, as, through, greater, effectiveness, of, a, sharper, edge, in, defeating, armour, or, improved, density, of, materials, used, in, manufacture, of, weapons, on, land, the, first, significant, technological, advance, in, warfare, was, the, development, of, ranged, weapons, notably, the, sling, and, later, the, bow, and, arrow, the, next, significant, advance, came, with, the, domestication, of, the, horses, and, mastering, of, equestrianism, creating, cavalry, and, allowing, for, faster, military, advances, and, better, logistics, possibly, the, most, significant, advancement, was, the, wheel, a, staple, of, transportation, starting, with, the, chariot, and, eventually, siege, engines, the, bow, was, manufactured, in, increasingly, larger, and, more, powerful, versions, to, increase, both, the, weapon, range, and, armour, penetration, performance, developing, into, composite, bows, recurve, bows, longbows, and, crossbows, these, proved, particularly, useful, during, the, rise, of, cavalry, as, horsemen, encased, in, ever, more, sophisticated, armour, came, to, dominate, the, battlefield, in, medieval, china, gunpowder, had, been, invented, and, was, increasingly, used, by, the, military, in, combat, the, use, of, gunpowder, in, the, early, vase, like, mortars, in, europe, and, advanced, versions, of, the, longbow, and, crossbow, with, armour, piercing, arrowheads, put, an, end, to, the, dominance, of, the, armoured, knight, gunpowder, resulted, in, the, development, and, fielding, of, the, musket, which, could, be, used, effectively, with, little, training, in, time, the, successors, to, muskets, and, cannons, in, the, form, of, rifles, and, artillery, would, become, core, battlefield, technology, as, the, speed, of, technological, advances, accelerated, in, civilian, applications, so, too, did, military, and, warfare, become, industrialized, the, newly, invented, machine, gun, and, repeating, rifle, redefined, firepower, on, the, battlefield, and, in, part, explains, the, high, casualty, rates, of, the, american, civil, war, and, the, decline, of, melee, combat, in, warfare, the, next, breakthrough, was, the, conversion, of, artillery, parks, from, the, muzzle, loading, guns, to, quicker, breech, loading, guns, with, recoiling, barrels, that, allowed, quicker, aimed, fire, and, use, of, a, shield, the, widespread, introduction, of, low, smoke, smokeless, propellant, powders, since, the, 1880s, also, allowed, for, a, great, improvement, of, artillery, ranges, the, development, of, breech, loading, had, the, greatest, effect, on, naval, warfare, for, the, first, time, since, the, middle, ages, altering, the, way, weapons, are, mounted, on, warships, naval, tactics, were, divorced, from, the, reliance, on, sails, with, the, invention, of, the, internal, combustion, a, further, advance, in, military, naval, technology, was, the, submarine, and, the, torpedo, during, world, war, i, the, need, to, break, the, deadlock, of, trench, warfare, saw, the, rapid, development, of, many, new, technologies, particularly, tanks, military, aviation, was, extensively, used, and, bombers, became, decisive, in, many, battles, of, world, war, ii, which, marked, the, most, frantic, period, of, weapons, development, in, history, many, new, designs, and, concepts, were, used, in, combat, and, all, existing, technologies, of, warfare, were, improved, between, 1939, and, 1945, during, world, war, ii, significant, advances, were, made, in, military, communications, through, increased, use, of, radio, military, intelligence, through, use, of, the, radar, and, in, military, medicine, through, use, of, penicillin, while, in, the, air, the, guided, missile, jet, aircraft, and, helicopters, were, seen, for, the, first, time, perhaps, the, most, infamous, of, all, military, technologies, was, the, creation, of, nuclear, weapons, although, the, exact, effects, of, its, radiation, were, unknown, until, the, early, 1950s, far, greater, use, of, military, vehicles, had, finally, eliminated, the, cavalry, from, the, military, force, structure, after, world, war, ii, with, the, onset, of, the, cold, war, the, constant, technological, development, of, new, weapons, was, institutionalized, as, participants, engaged, in, a, constant, arms, race, in, capability, development, this, constant, state, of, weapons, development, continues, into, the, present, main, battle, tanks, and, other, heavy, equipment, such, as, armoured, fighting, vehicles, military, aircraft, and, ships, are, characteristic, to, organized, military, forces, the, most, significant, technological, developments, that, influenced, combat, have, been, guided, missiles, which, can, be, used, by, all, branches, of, the, armed, services, more, recently, information, technology, and, its, use, in, surveillance, including, space, based, reconnaissance, systems, have, played, an, increasing, role, in, military, operations, the, impact, of, information, warfare, which, focuses, on, attacking, command, communication, systems, and, military, databases, has, been, coupled, with, the, use, of, robotic, systems, in, combat, such, as, unmanned, combat, aerial, vehicles, and, unmanned, ground, vehicles, recently, there, has, also, been, a, particular, focus, towards, the, use, of, renewable, fuels, for, running, military, vehicles, on, unlike, fossil, fuels, renewable, fuels, can, be, produced, in, any, country, creating, a, strategic, advantage, the, u, s, military, has, committed, itself, to, have, 50, of, its, energy, consumption, come, from, alternative, sources, for, much, of, military, history, the, armed, forces, were, considered, to, be, for, use, by, the, heads, of, their, societies, until, recently, the, crowned, heads, of, states, in, a, democracy, or, other, political, system, run, in, the, public, interest, it, is, a, public, force, the, relationship, between, the, military, and, the, society, it, serves, is, a, complicated, and, ever, evolving, one, much, depends, on, the, nature, of, the, society, itself, and, whether, it, sees, the, military, as, important, as, for, example, in, time, of, threat, or, war, or, a, burdensome, expense, typified, by, defence, cuts, in, time, of, peace, one, difficult, matter, in, the, relation, between, military, and, society, is, control, and, transparency, in, some, countries, limited, information, on, military, operations, and, budgeting, is, accessible, for, the, public, however, transparency, in, the, military, sector, is, crucial, to, fight, corruption, this, showed, the, government, defence, anti, corruption, index, transparency, international, uk, published, in, 2013, militaries, often, function, as, societies, within, societies, by, having, their, own, military, communities, economies, education, medicine, and, other, aspects, of, a, functioning, civilian, society, a, military, is, not, limited, to, nations, in, of, itself, as, many, private, military, companies, or, pmcs, can, be, used, or, hired, by, organizations, and, figures, as, security, escort,

being, a, beneficiary, of, a, government, or, guided, by, concepts, embodied, in, the, military, culture, doctrine, system, or, leaders, either, because, of, the, cultural, memory, national, history, or, the, potentiality, of, a, military, threat, the, militarist, argument, asserts, that, a, civilian, population, is, dependent, upon, and, thereby, subservient, to, the, needs, and, goals, of, its,

military, laws, which, regulate, conduct, in, war, and, during, peacetime, an, early, exponent, was, hugo, grotius, whose, on, the, law, of, war, and, peace, 1625, had, a, major, impact, of, the, humanitarian, approach, to, warfare, development, his, theme, was, echoed, by, gustavus, adolphus, ethics, of, warfare, have, developed, since, 1945, to, create, constraints, on, the, military, treatment, of, prisoners, and, civilians, primarily, by, the, geneva, conventions, but, rarely, apply, to, use, of, the, military, forces, as, internal, security, troops, during, times, of, political,

guilty, of, war, crimes, military, actions, are, sometimes, argued, to, be, justified, by, furthering, a, humanitarian, cause, such, as, disaster, relief, operations, to, defend, refugees, such, actions, are, called, military, humanism
