a, census, is, the, procedure, of, systematically, acquiring, recording, and, calculating, population, information, about, the, members, of, a, given, population, this, term, is, used, mostly, in, connection, with, national, population, and, housing, censuses, other, common, censuses, include, censuses, of, agriculture, traditional, culture, business, supplies, and, traffic, censuses, the, united, nations, un, defines, the, essential, features, of, population, and, housing, censuses, as, individual, enumeration, universality, within, a, defined, territory, simultaneity, and, defined, periodicity, and, recommends, that, population, censuses, be, taken, at, least, every, ten, years, un, recommendations, also, cover, census, topics, to, be, collected, official, definitions, classifications, and, other, useful, information, to, co, ordinate, international, practices, the, un, s, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, in, turn, defines, the, census, of, agriculture, as, a, statistical, operation, for, collecting, processing, and, disseminating, data, on, the, structure, of, agriculture, covering, the, whole, or, a, significant, part, of, a, country, in, a, census, of, agriculture, data, are, collected, at, the, holding, level, the, word, is, of, latin, origin, during, the, roman, republic, the, census, was, a, list, of, all, adult, males, fit, for, military, service, the, modern, census, is, essential, to, international, comparisons, of, any, type, of, statistics, and, censuses, collect, data, on, many, attributes, of, a, population, not, just, the, number, of, individuals, censuses, typically, began, as, the, only, method, of, collecting, national, demographic, data, and, are, now, part, of, a, larger, system, of, different, surveys, although, population, estimates, remain, an, important, function, of, a, census, including, exactly, the, geographic, distribution, of, the, population, or, the, agricultural, population, statistics, can, be, produced, about, combinations, of, attributes, e, g, education, by, age, and, sex, in, different, regions, current, administrative, data, systems, allow, for, other, approaches, to, enumeration, with, the, same, level, of, detail, but, raise, concerns, about, privacy, and, the, possibility, of, biasing, estimates, a, census, can, be, contrasted, with, sampling, in, which, information, is, obtained, only, from, a, subset, of, a, population, typically, main, population, estimates, are, updated, by, such, intercensal, estimates, modern, census, data, are, commonly, used, for, research, business, marketing, and, planning, and, as, a, baseline, for, designing, sample, surveys, by, providing, a, sampling, frame, such, as, an, address, register, census, counts, are, necessary, to, adjust, samples, to, be, representative, of, a, population, by, weighting, them, as, is, common, in, opinion, polling, similarly, stratification, requires, knowledge, of, the, relative, sizes, of, different, population, strata, which, can, be, derived, from, census, enumerations, in, some, countries, the, census, provides, the, official, counts, used, to, apportion, the, number, of, elected, representatives, to, regions, sometimes, controversially, e, g, utah, v, evans, in, many, cases, a, carefully, chosen, random, sample, can, provide, more, accurate, information, than, attempts, to, get, a, population, census, a, census, is, often, construed, as, the, opposite, of, a, sample, as, its, intent, is, to, count, everyone, in, a, population, rather, than, a, fraction, however, population, censuses, do, rely, on, a, sampling, frame, to, count, the, population, this, is, the, only, way, to, be, sure, that, everyone, has, been, included, as, otherwise, those, not, responding, would, not, be, followed, up, on, and, individuals, could, be, missed, the, fundamental, premise, of, a, census, is, that, the, population, is, not, known, and, a, new, estimate, is, to, be, made, by, the, analysis, of, primary, data, the, use, of, a, sampling, frame, is, counterintuitive, as, it, suggests, that, the, population, size, is, already, known, however, a, census, is, also, used, to, collect, attribute, data, on, the, individuals, in, the, nation, not, only, to, assess, population, size, this, process, of, sampling, marks, the, difference, between, a, historical, census, which, was, a, house, to, house, process, or, the, product, of, an, imperial, decree, and, the, modern, statistical, project, the, sampling, frame, used, by, a, census, is, almost, always, an, address, register, thus, it, is, not, known, if, there, is, anyone, resident, or, how, many, people, there, are, in, each, household, depending, on, the, mode, of, enumeration, a, form, is, sent, to, the, householder, an, enumerator, calls, or, administrative, records, for, the, dwelling, are, accessed, as, a, preliminary, to, the, dispatch, of, forms, census, workers, will, check, any, address, problems, on, the, ground, while, it, may, seem, straightforward, to, use, the, postal, service, file, for, this, purpose, this, can, be, out, of, date, and, some, dwellings, may, contain, a, number, of, independent, households, a, particular, problem, is, what, are, termed, communal, establishments, a, category, that, includes, student, residences, religious, orders, homes, for, the, elderly, people, in, prisons, etc, as, these, are, not, easily, enumerated, by, a, single, householder, they, are, often, treated, differently, and, visited, by, special, teams, of, census, workers, to, ensure, they, are, classified, appropriately, individuals, are, normally, counted, within, households, and, information, is, typically, collected, about, the, household, structure, and, the, housing, for, this, reason, international, documents, refer, to, censuses, of, population, and, housing, normally, the, census, response, is, made, by, a, household, indicating, details, of, individuals, resident, there, an, important, aspect, of, census, enumerations, is, determining, which, individuals, can, be, counted, and, which, cannot, be, counted, broadly, three, definitions, can, be, used, de, facto, residence, de, jure, residence, and, permanent, residence, this, is, important, in, considering, individuals, who, have, multiple, or, temporary, addresses, every, person, should, be, identified, uniquely, as, resident, in, one, place, but, the, place, where, they, happen, to, be, on, census, day, their, de, facto, residence, may, not, be, the, best, place, to, count, them, where, an, individual, uses, services, may, be, more, useful, and, this, is, at, their, usual, residence, an, individual, may, be, recorded, at, a, permanent, address, which, might, be, a, family, home, for, students, or, long, term, migrants, a, precise, definition, of, residence, is, needed, to, decide, whether, visitors, to, a, country, should, be, included, in, the, population, count, this, is, becoming, more, important, as, students, travel, abroad, for, education, for, a, period, of, several, years, other, groups, causing, problems, of, enumeration, are, new, born, babies, refugees, people, away, on, holiday, people, moving, home, around, census, day, and, people, without, a, fixed, address, people, with, second, homes, because, they, are, working, in, another, part, of, the, country, or, have, a, holiday, cottage, are, difficult, to, fix, at, a, particular, address, this, sometimes, causes, double, counting, or, houses, being, mistakenly, identified, as, vacant, another, problem, is, where, people, use, a, different, address, at, different, times, e, g, students, living, at, their, place, of, education, in, term, time, but, returning, to, a, family, home, during, vacations, or, children, whose, parents, have, separated, who, effectively, have, two, family, homes, census, enumeration, has, always, been, based, on, finding, people, where, they, live, as, there, is, no, systematic, alternative, any, list, used, to, find, people, is, likely, to, be, derived, from, census, activities, in, the, first, place, recent, un, guidelines, provide, recommendations, on, enumerating, such, complex, households, in, the, census, of, agriculture, data, is, collected, at, the, agricultural, holding, unit, an, agricultural, holding, is, an, economic, unit, of, agricultural, production, under, single, management, comprising, all, livestock, kept, and, all, land, used, wholly, or, partly, for, agricultural, production, purposes, without, regard, to, title, legal, form, or, size, single, management, may, be, exercised, by, an, individual, or, household, jointly, by, two, or, more, individuals, or, households, by, a, clan, or, tribe, or, by, a, juridical, person, such, as, a, corporation, cooperative, or, government, agency, the, holding, s, land, may, consist, of, one, or, more, parcels, located, in, one, or, more, separate, areas, or, in, one, or, more, territorial, or, administrative, divisions, providing, the, parcels, share, the, same, production, means, such, as, labour, farm, buildings, machinery, or, draught, animals, historical, censuses, used, crude, enumeration, assuming, absolute, accuracy, modern, approaches, take, into, account, the, problems, of, overcount, and, undercount, and, the, coherence, of, census, enumerations, with, other, official, sources, of, data, for, instance, during, the, 2020, u, s, census, the, census, bureau, counted, people, primarily, by, collecting, answers, sent, by, mail, on, the, internet, over, the, phone, or, using, shared, information, through, proxies, these, methods, accounted, for, 95, 5, percent, of, all, occupied, housing, units, in, the, united, states, this, reflects, a, realist, approach, to, measurement, acknowledging, that, under, any, definition, of, residence, there, is, a, true, value, of, the, population, but, this, can, never, be, measured, with, complete, accuracy, an, important, aspect, of, the, census, process, is, to, evaluate, the, quality, of, the, data, many, countries, use, a, post, enumeration, survey, to, adjust, the, raw, census, counts, this, works, in, a, similar, manner, to, capture, recapture, estimation, for, animal, populations, among, census, experts, this, method, is, called, dual, system, enumeration, dse, a, sample, of, households, are, visited, by, interviewers, who, record, the, details, of, the, household, as, at, census, day, these, data, are, then, matched, to, census, records, and, the, number, of, people, missed, can, be, estimated, by, considering, the, numbers, of, people, who, are, included, in, one, count, but, not, the, other, this, allows, adjustments, to, the, count, for, non, response, varying, between, different, demographic, groups, an, explanation, using, a, fishing, analogy, can, be, found, in, trout, catfish, and, roach, which, won, an, award, from, the, royal, statistical, society, for, excellence, in, official, statistics, in, 2011, triple, system, enumeration, has, been, proposed, as, an, improvement, as, it, would, allow, evaluation, of, the, statistical, dependence, of, pairs, of, sources, however, as, the, matching, process, is, the, most, difficult, aspect, of, census, estimation, this, has, never, been, implemented, for, a, national, enumeration, it, would, also, be, difficult, to, identify, three, different, sources, that, were, sufficiently, different, to, make, the, triple, system, effort, worthwhile, the, dse, approach, has, another, weakness, in, that, it, assumes, there, is, no, person, counted, twice, over, count, in, de, facto, residence, definitions, this, would, not, be, a, problem, but, in, de, jure, definitions, individuals, risk, being, recorded, on, more, than, one, form, leading, to, double, counting, a, particular, problem, here, is, students, who, often, have, a, term, time, and, family, address, several, countries, have, used, a, system, known, as, short, form, long, form, this, is, a, sampling, strategy, that, randomly, chooses, a, proportion, of, people, to, send, a, more, detailed, questionnaire, to, the, long, form, everyone, receives, the, short, form, questions, this, means, more, data, are, collected, but, without, imposing, a, burden, on, the, whole, population, this, also, reduces, the, burden, on, the, statistical, office, indeed, in, the, uk, until, 2001, all, residents, were, required, to, fill, in, the, whole, form, but, only, a, 10, sample, were, coded, and, analysed, in, detail, new, technology, means, that, all, data, are, now, scanned, and, processed, during, the, 2011, canadian, census, there, was, controversy, about, the, cessation, of, the, mandatory, long, form, census, the, head, of, statistics, canada, munir, sheikh, resigned, upon, the, federal, government, s, decision, to, do, so, the, use, of, alternative, enumeration, strategies, is, increasing, but, these, are, not, as, simple, as, many, people, assume, and, are, only, used, in, developed, countries, the, netherlands, has, been, most, advanced, in, adopting, a, census, using, administrative, data, this, allows, a, simulated, census, to, be, conducted, by, linking, several, different, administrative, databases, at, an, agreed, time, data, can, be, matched, and, an, overall, enumeration, established, allowing, for, discrepancies, between, different, data, sources, a, validation, survey, is, still, conducted, in, a, similar, way, to, the, post, enumeration, survey, employed, in, a, traditional, census, other, countries, that, have, a, population, register, use, this, as, a, basis, for, all, the, census, statistics, needed, by, users, this, is, most, common, among, nordic, countries, but, requires, many, distinct, registers, to, be, combined, including, population, housing, employment, and, education, these, registers, are, then, combined, and, brought, up, to, the, standard, of, a, statistical, register, by, comparing, the, data, in, different, sources, and, ensuring, the, quality, is, sufficient, for, official, statistics, to, be, produced, a, recent, innovation, is, the, french, instigation, of, a, rolling, census, programme, with, different, regions, enumerated, each, year, so, that, the, whole, country, is, completely, enumerated, every, 5, to, 10, years, in, europe, in, connection, with, the, 2010, census, round, many, countries, adopted, alternative, census, methodologies, often, based, on, the, combination, of, data, from, registers, surveys, and, other, sources, censuses, have, evolved, in, their, use, of, technology, censuses, in, 2010, used, many, new, types, of, computing, in, brazil, handheld, devices, were, used, by, enumerators, to, locate, residences, on, the, ground, in, many, countries, census, returns, could, be, made, via, the, internet, as, well, as, in, paper, form, dse, is, facilitated, by, computer, matching, techniques, that, can, be, automated, such, as, propensity, score, matching, in, the, uk, all, census, formats, are, scanned, and, stored, electronically, before, being, destroyed, replacing, the, need, for, physical, archives, the, record, linking, to, perform, an, administrative, census, would, not, be, possible, without, large, databases, being, stored, on, computer, systems, there, are, sometimes, problems, in, introducing, new, technology, the, us, census, had, been, intended, to, use, handheld, computers, but, cost, escalated, and, this, was, abandoned, with, the, contract, being, sold, to, brazil, online, response, has, some, advantages, but, one, of, the, functions, of, the, census, is, to, make, sure, everyone, is, counted, accurately, a, system, that, allowed, people, to, enter, their, address, without, verification, would, be, open, to, abuse, therefore, households, have, to, be, verified, on, the, ground, typically, by, an, enumerator, visit, or, post, out, paper, forms, are, still, necessary, for, those, without, access, to, the, internet, it, is, also, possible, that, the, hidden, nature, of, an, administrative, census, means, that, users, are, not, engaged, with, the, importance, of, contributing, their, data, to, official, statistics, alternatively, population, estimations, may, be, carried, out, remotely, with, geographic, information, system, gis, and, remote, sensing, technologies, according, to, the, united, nations, population, fund, unfpa, the, information, generated, by, a, population, and, housing, census, numbers, of, people, their, distribution, their, living, conditions, and, other, key, data, is, critical, for, development, this, is, because, this, type, of, data, is, essential, for, policymakers, so, that, they, know, where, to, invest, many, countries, have, outdated, or, inaccurate, data, about, their, populations, and, thus, have, difficulty, in, addressing, the, needs, of, the, population, the, unfpa, said, the, unique, advantage, of, the, census, is, that, it, represents, the, entire, statistical, universe, down, to, the, smallest, geographical, units, of, a, country, or, region, planners, need, this, information, for, all, kinds, of, development, work, including, assessing, demographic, trends, analysing, socio, economic, conditions, designing, evidence, based, poverty, reduction, strategies, monitoring, and, evaluating, the, effectiveness, of, policies, and, tracking, progress, toward, national, and, internationally, agreed, development, goals, in, addition, to, making, policymakers, aware, of, population, issues, the, census, is, also, an, important, tool, for, identifying, forms, of, social, demographic, or, economic, exclusions, such, as, inequalities, relating, to, race, ethics, and, religion, as, well, as, disadvantaged, groups, such, as, those, with, disabilities, and, the, poor, an, accurate, census, can, empower, local, communities, by, providing, them, with, the, necessary, information, to, participate, in, local, decision, making, and, ensuring, they, are, represented, the, importance, of, the, census, of, agriculture, for, development, is, that, it, gives, a, snapshot, of, the, structure, of, the, agricultural, sector, in, a, country, and, when, compared, with, previous, censuses, provides, an, opportunity, to, identify, trends, and, structural, transformations, of, the, sector, and, points, towards, areas, for, policy, intervention, census, data, are, used, as, a, benchmark, for, current, statistics, and, their, value, is, increased, when, they, are, employed, together, with, other, data, sources, early, censuses, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, collected, paper, documents, which, had, to, be, collated, by, hand, so, the, statistical, information, obtained, was, quite, basic, the, government, that, owned, the, data, could, publish, statistics, on, the, state, of, the, nation, the, results, were, used, to, measure, changes, in, the, population, and, apportion, representation, population, estimates, could, be, compared, to, those, of, other, countries, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, censuses, were, recording, households, and, some, indications, of, their, employment, in, some, countries, census, archives, are, released, for, public, examination, after, many, decades, allowing, genealogists, to, track, the, ancestry, of, interested, people, archives, provide, a, substantial, historical, record, which, may, challenge, established, views, information, such, as, job, titles, and, arrangements, for, the, destitute, and, sick, may, also, shed, light, on, the, historical, structure, of, society, political, considerations, influence, the, census, in, many, countries, in, canada, in, 2010, for, example, the, government, under, the, leadership, of, stephen, harper, abolished, the, mandatory, long, form, census, this, abolition, was, a, response, to, protests, from, some, canadians, who, resented, the, personal, questions, the, long, form, census, was, reinstated, by, the, justin, trudeau, government, in, 2016, as, governments, assumed, responsibility, for, schooling, and, welfare, large, government, research, departments, made, extensive, use, of, census, data, population, projections, could, be, made, to, help, plan, for, provision, in, local, government, and, regions, central, government, could, also, use, census, data, to, allocate, funding, even, in, the, mid, 20th, century, census, data, was, only, directly, accessible, to, large, government, departments, however, computers, meant, that, tabulations, could, be, used, directly, by, university, researchers, large, businesses, and, local, government, offices, they, could, use, the, detail, of, the, data, to, answer, new, questions, and, add, to, local, and, specialist, knowledge, nowadays, census, data, are, published, in, a, wide, variety, of, formats, to, be, accessible, to, business, all, levels, of, government, media, students, and, teachers, charities, and, any, citizen, who, is, interested, researchers, in, particular, have, an, interest, in, the, role, of, census, field, officers, cfo, and, their, assistants, data, can, be, represented, visually, or, analysed, in, complex, statistical, models, to, show, the, difference, between, certain, areas, or, to, understand, the, association, between, different, personal, characteristics, census, data, offer, a, unique, insight, into, small, areas, and, small, demographic, groups, which, sample, data, would, be, unable, to, capture, with, precision, in, the, census, of, agriculture, users, need, census, data, to, although, the, census, provides, useful, statistical, information, about, a, population, the, availability, of, this, information, could, sometimes, lead, to, abuses, political, or, otherwise, by, the, linking, of, individuals, identities, to, anonymous, census, data, this, is, particularly, important, when, individuals, census, responses, are, made, available, in, microdata, form, but, even, aggregate, level, data, can, result, in, privacy, breaches, when, dealing, with, small, areas, and, or, rare, subpopulations, for, instance, when, reporting, data, from, a, large, city, it, might, be, appropriate, to, give, the, average, income, for, black, males, aged, between, 50, and, 60, however, doing, this, for, a, town, that, only, has, two, black, males, in, this, age, group, would, be, a, breach, of, privacy, because, either, of, those, persons, knowing, his, own, income, and, the, reported, average, could, determine, the, other, man, s, income, typically, census, data, are, processed, to, obscure, such, individual, information, some, agencies, do, this, by, intentionally, introducing, small, statistical, errors, to, prevent, the, identification, of, individuals, in, marginal, populations, others, swap, variables, for, similar, respondents, whatever, is, done, to, reduce, the, privacy, risk, new, improved, electronic, analysis, of, data, can, threaten, to, reveal, sensitive, individual, information, this, is, known, as, statistical, disclosure, control, another, possibility, is, to, present, survey, results, by, means, of, statistical, models, in, the, form, of, a, multivariate, distribution, mixture, the, statistical, information, in, the, form, of, conditional, distributions, histograms, can, be, derived, interactively, from, the, estimated, mixture, model, without, any, further, access, to, the, original, database, as, the, final, product, does, not, contain, any, protected, microdata, the, model, based, interactive, software, can, be, distributed, without, any, confidentiality, concerns, another, method, is, simply, to, release, no, data, at, all, except, very, large, scale, data, directly, to, the, central, government, differing, release, strategies, of, governments, have, led, to, an, international, project, ipums, to, co, ordinate, access, to, microdata, and, corresponding, metadata, such, projects, such, as, sdmx, also, promote, standardising, metadata, so, that, best, use, can, be, made, of, the, minimal, data, available, censuses, in, egypt, first, appeared, in, the, late, middle, kingdom, and, developed, in, the, new, kingdom, pharaoh, amasis, according, to, herodotus, required, every, egyptian, to, declare, annually, to, the, nomarch, whence, he, gained, his, living, under, the, ptolemies, and, the, romans, several, censuses, were, conducted, in, egypt, by, government, officials, there, are, several, accounts, of, ancient, greek, city, states, carrying, out, censuses, censuses, are, mentioned, several, times, in, the, biblical, narrative, god, commands, a, per, capita, tax, to, be, paid, with, the, census, for, the, upkeep, of, the, tabernacle, the, book, of, numbers, is, named, after, the, counting, of, the, israelite, population, according, to, the, house, of, the, fathers, after, the, exodus, from, egypt, a, second, census, was, taken, while, the, israelites, were, camped, in, the, plains, of, moab, king, david, performed, a, census, that, produced, disastrous, results, his, son, king, solomon, had, all, of, the, foreigners, in, israel, counted, one, of, the, world, s, earliest, preserved, censuses, was, held, in, china, in, ad, 2, during, the, han, dynasty, and, is, still, considered, by, scholars, to, be, quite, accurate, the, population, was, registered, as, having, 57, 671, 400, individuals, in, 12, 366, 470, households, but, on, this, occasion, only, taxable, families, had, been, taken, into, account, indicating, the, income, and, the, number, of, soldiers, who, could, be, mobilized, another, census, was, held, in, ad, 144, the, oldest, recorded, census, in, india, is, thought, to, have, occurred, around, 330, bc, during, the, reign, of, emperor, chandragupta, maurya, under, the, leadership, of, chanakya, and, ashoka, the, english, term, is, taken, directly, from, the, latin, census, from, censere, to, estimate, the, census, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, administration, of, the, roman, government, as, it, was, used, to, determine, the, class, a, citizen, belonged, to, for, both, military, and, tax, purposes, beginning, in, the, middle, republic, it, was, usually, carried, out, every, five, years, it, provided, a, register, of, citizens, and, their, property, from, which, their, duties, and, privileges, could, be, listed, it, is, said, to, have, been, instituted, by, the, roman, king, servius, tullius, in, the, 6th, century, bc, at, which, time, the, number, of, arms, bearing, citizens, was, supposedly, counted, at, around, 80, 000, when, the, romans, conquered, judea, in, ad, 6, the, legate, publius, sulpicius, quirinius, organized, a, census, for, tax, purposes, which, was, partially, responsible, for, the, development, of, the, zealot, movement, and, several, failed, rebellions, against, rome, ultimately, ending, in, the, jewish, diaspora, the, gospel, of, luke, makes, reference, to, quirinius, census, in, relation, to, the, birth, of, jesus, based, on, variant, readings, of, this, passage, a, minority, of, biblical, scholars, including, n, t, wright, speculate, that, this, passage, refers, to, a, separate, registration, conducted, during, the, reign, of, herod, the, great, several, years, before, quirinius, census, the, 15, year, indiction, cycle, established, by, diocletian, in, ad, 297, was, based, on, quindecennial, censuses, and, formed, the, basis, for, dating, in, late, antiquity, and, under, the, byzantine, empire, in, the, middle, ages, the, caliphate, began, conducting, regular, censuses, soon, after, its, formation, beginning, with, the, one, ordered, by, the,
