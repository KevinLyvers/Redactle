in, the, field, of, military, theory, the, operational, level, of, war, also, called, operational, art, as, derived, from, russian, or, operational, warfare, represents, the, level, of, command, that, connects, the, details, of, tactics, with, the, goals, of, strategy, in, u, s, joint, military, doctrine, operational, art, is, the, cognitive, approach, by, commanders, and, staffs, supported, by, their, skill, knowledge, experience, creativity, and, judgment, to, develop, strategies, campaigns, and, operations, to, organize, and, employ, military, forces, by, integrating, ends, ways, and, means, it, correlates, political, requirements, with, military, power, operational, art, is, defined, by, its, military, political, scope, not, by, force, size, scale, of, operations, or, degree, of, effort, likewise, operational, art, provides, theory, and, skills, and, the, operational, level, permits, doctrinal, structure, and, process, the, operational, level, of, war, is, concerned, with, four, essential, elements, time, space, means, and, purpose, through, means, such, as, directing, troops, and, allocating, limited, resources, among, others, operational, art, aims, to, achieve, political, goals, by, producing, an, optimal, or, at, least, near, optimal, generation, and, application, of, military, power, for, example, proposals, may, be, generated, to, identify, where, to, build, defensive, structures, how, many, what, kind, and, manned, by, how, many, troops, a, proposal, may, be, accepted, or, reworked, during, the, 20th, century, the, nascent, field, of, operations, research, flourished, as, a, result, of, military, efforts, to, improve, logistics, and, decision, making, the, operational, level, of, war, sits, between, tactics, which, consists, of, organizing, and, employing, fighting, forces, on, or, near, the, battlefield, and, strategy, which, involves, aspects, of, long, term, and, high, level, theatre, operations, and, government, leadership, the, soviet, union, was, the, first, country, to, officially, distinguish, this, third, level, of, military, thinking, which, was, introduced, as, part, of, the, deep, operation, military, theory, that, soviet, armed, forces, developed, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, and, utilized, during, the, second, world, war, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, the, synonymous, terms, grand, tactics, or, less, frequently, maneuver, tactics, was, often, used, to, describe, the, manoeuvres, of, troops, not, tactically, engaged, while, in, the, late, 19th, century, to, the, first, world, war, and, throughout, the, second, world, war, the, term, minor, strategy, was, used, by, some, military, commentators, confusion, over, terminology, was, exposed, in, professional, military, publications, that, sought, to, identify, slightly, different, shades, of, meaning, such, as, tactics, major, tactics, minor, tactics, grand, strategy, major, strategy, and, minor, strategy, the, term, operational, art, was, not, widely, used, in, the, united, states, or, britain, before, 1980, 1981, when, it, became, much, discussed, and, started, to, enter, military, doctrines, and, officer, combat, training, courses, operational, art, comprises, four, essential, elements, time, space, means, and, purpose, each, element, is, found, in, greater, complexity, at, the, operational, level, than, at, the, tactical, or, strategic, level, this, is, true, partly, because, operational, art, must, consider, and, incorporate, more, of, the, strategic, and, tactical, levels, than, those, levels, must, absorb, from, the, operational, level, although, much, can, be, gained, by, examining, the, four, elements, independently, it, is, only, when, they, are, viewed, together, that, operational, art, reveals, its, intricate, fabric, the, challenge, of, operational, art, is, to, establish, a, four, element, equilibrium, that, permits, the, optimal, generation, and, application, of, military, power, in, achieving, the, political, goal, viewing, time, space, means, and, purpose, as, a, whole, requires, great, skill, in, organizing, weighing, and, envisioning, masses, of, complex, often, contradictory, factors, these, factors, often, exist, for, extended, periods, over, great, distances, and, with, shifting, mixes, of, players, systems, and, beliefs, pursuing, political, goals, which, may, or, may, not, be, clear, cogent, or, settled, compounding, factors, such, as, the, opponent, s, actions, create, further, ambiguity, the, operational, level, strategist, possesses, numerous, tools, to, frame, and, guide, their, thinking, but, chief, among, these, are, mission, analysis, and, end, state, mission, analysis, answers, the, question, what, is, to, be, accomplished, through, mission, analysis, the, operational, level, planner, fuses, political, aims, with, military, objectives, in, so, doing, the, planner, determines, what, application, of, military, force, will, create, military, power, to, achieve, the, political, purpose, subordinate, processes, here, include, defining, objectives, and, centers, of, gravity, but, excessive, dependence, on, analytical, mechanisms, can, create, false, security, the, final, test, rewards, success, not, the, quality, of, the, argument, conversely, the, planner, cannot, hope, to, feel, a, way, to, victory, complexity, demands, an, integration, of, thought, and, effort, end, state, answers, the, question, what, will, constitute, success, the, campaign, end, state, is, not, merely, a, desired, status, quo, of, the, military, goal, it, also, establishes, a, touchstone, for, the, tactical, operational, and, strategic, levels, the, end, state, manifests, the, intended, results, of, military, power, and, exposes, any, limitations, indeed, an, achievable, end, state, may, require, the, employment, of, nonmilitary, elements, of, national, power, as, such, it, recognizes, that, military, power, alone, may, not, be, capable, of, attaining, political, success, an, operational, level, strategy, must, continually, identify, and, weigh, time, space, means, and, purpose, extrapolating, from, them, outcomes, and, likelihood, to, accomplish, this, practitioners, need, both, skill, and, theory, experience, and, knowledge, at, the, operational, level, skills, and, experience, must, usually, be, developed, indirectly, through, formal, training, military, history, and, real, world, practice, success, at, the, tactical, level, is, no, guarantee, of, success, at, the, operational, level, since, mastery, of, operational, art, demands, strategic, skills, but, not, vice, versa, without, a, strong, grounding, in, the, theory, and, application, of, operational, art, a, successful, tactician, has, little, hope, of, making, the, demanding, leap, from, tactics, the, operational, level, strategist, must, see, clearly, and, expansively, from, the, foxhole, into, the, corridors, of, national, or, coalition, authority, they, must, be, aware, of, the, plausibility, and, coherence, of, strategic, aims, national, will, and, the, players, who, decide, them, successful, operational, art, charts, a, clear, unbroken, path, from, the, individual, soldier, s, efforts, to, the, state, or, coalition, s, goals, while, the, emerging, corpus, of, operational, art, and, the, establishment, of, a, specifically, operational, level, of, war, are, relatively, new, in, practice, operational, art, has, existed, throughout, recorded, history, peoples, and, commanders, have, long, pursued, political, goals, through, military, actions, and, one, can, examine, campaigns, of, any, period, from, the, existential, perspective, of, operational, art, current, schools, of, thought, on, the, operational, art, share, the, fundamental, view, that, military, success, can, be, measured, only, in, the, attainment, of, political, strategic, aims, and, thus, historians, can, analyze, any, war, in, terms, of, operational, art, in, the, case, of, world, war, ii, analysis, the, wehrmacht, did, not, use, the, operational, level, as, a, formal, doctrinal, concept, during, the, campaigns, of, 1939, 1945, while, personnel, within, the, german, forces, knew, of, operational, art, awareness, and, practice, was, limited, principally, to, general, staff, trained, officers, nevertheless, the, existential, nature, of, operational, art, means, that, examining, a, campaign, or, an, operation, against, political, aims, is, valid, irrespective, of, the, doctrine, or, structures, of, the, period, thus, the, elements, of, operational, art, time, space, means, and, purpose, can, illuminate, thoughts, and, actions, of, any, era, regardless, of, the, prevailing, contemporary, doctrine, or, structure
