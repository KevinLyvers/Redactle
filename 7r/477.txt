historically, the, language, was, referred, to, by, its, native, speakers, as, t, rk, dili, or, t, rkc, meaning, either, turkish, or, turkic, in, the, early, years, following, the, establishment, of, the, azerbaijan, soviet, socialist, republic, the, language, was, still, referred, to, as, turkish, in, official, documents, however, in, the, 1930s, its, name, was, officially, changed, to, azerbaijani, the, language, is, often, still, referred, to, as, turki, or, torki, in, iranian, azerbaijan, the, term, azeri, generally, interchangeable, with, azerbaijani, is, from, turkish, azeri, which, is, used, for, the, people, azerice, being, used, for, the, language, in, turkish, itself, from, persian, zar, the, term, is, also, used, for, old, azeri, the, ancient, iranian, language, spoken, in, the, region, until, the, 17th, century, azerbaijani, evolved, from, the, eastern, branch, of, oghuz, turkic, western, turkic, which, spread, to, the, caucasus, in, eastern, europe, and, northern, iran, in, western, asia, during, the, medieval, turkic, migrations, persian, and, arabic, influenced, the, language, but, arabic, words, were, mainly, transmitted, through, the, intermediary, of, literary, persian, azerbaijani, is, perhaps, after, uzbek, the, turkic, language, upon, which, persian, and, other, iranian, languages, have, exerted, the, strongest, impact, mainly, in, phonology, syntax, and, vocabulary, less, in, morphology, the, turkic, language, of, azerbaijan, gradually, supplanted, the, iranian, languages, in, what, is, now, northwestern, iran, and, a, variety, of, languages, of, the, caucasus, and, iranian, languages, spoken, in, the, caucasus, particularly, udi, and, old, azeri, by, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, it, had, become, the,

divided, into, two, major, periods, early, c, 14th, to, 18th, century, and, modern, 18th, century, to, present, early, azerbaijani, differs, from, its, descendant, in, that, it, contained, a, much, larger, number, of, persian, and, arabic, loanwords, phrases, and, syntactic, elements, early, writings, in, azerbaijani, also, demonstrate, linguistic, interchangeability, between, oghuz, and, kypchak, elements, in, many, aspects, such, as, pronouns, case, endings, participles, etc, as, azerbaijani, gradually, moved, from, being, merely, a, language, of, epic, and, lyric, poetry, to, being, also, a, language, of, journalism, and, scientific, research, its, literary, version, has, become, more, or, less, unified, and, simplified, with, the, loss, of, many, archaic, turkic, elements, stilted, iranisms, and, ottomanisms, and, other, words, expressions, and, rules, that, failed, to, gain, popularity, among, the, azerbaijani, masses, the, russian, annexation, of, iran, s, territories, in, the, caucasus, through, the, russo, iranian, wars, of, 1804, 1813, and, 1826, 1828, split, the, language, community, across, two, states, afterwards, the, tsarist, administration, encouraged, the, spread, of, azerbaijani, in, eastern, transcaucasia, as, a, replacement, for, persian, spoken, by, the, upper, classes, and, as, a, measure, against, persian, influence, in, the, region, between, c, 1900, and, 1930, there, were, several, competing, approaches, to, the, unification, of, the, national, language, in, what, is, now, the, azerbaijan, republic, popularized, by, scholars, such, as, hasan, bey, zardabi, and, mammad, agha, shahtakhtinski, despite, major, differences, they, all, aimed, primarily, at, making, it, easy, for, semi, literate, masses, to, read, and, understand, literature, they, all, criticized, the, overuse, of, persian, arabic, and, european, elements, in, both, colloquial, and, literary, language, and, called, for, a, simpler, and, more, popular, style, the, soviet, union, promoted, the, development, of, the, language, but, set, it, back, considerably, with, two, successive, script, changes, from, the, persian, to, latin, and, then, to, the, cyrillic, script, while, iranian, azerbaijanis, continued, to, use, the, persian, script, as, they, always, had, despite, the, wide, use, of, azerbaijani, in, the, azerbaijan, soviet, socialist, republic, it, became, the, official, language, of, azerbaijan, only, in, 1956, after, independence, the, republic, of, azerbaijan, decided, to, switch, back, to, a, modified, latin, script,

munda, m, nda, mundan, m, ndan, this, is, observed, in, the, turkmen, literary, language, as, well, where, the, demonstrative, pronoun, bu, undergoes, some, changes, just, as, in, munu, mun, mu, a, munda, mundan, mun, a, b, m, replacement, is, encountered, in, many, dialects, of, the, turkmen, language, and, may, be, observed, in, such, words, as, boyun, moy, n, in, yomut, gunbatar, dialect, b,

and, reconstruction, of, the, khazar, language, azerbaijani, phonotactics, is, similar, to, that, of, other, oghuz, turkic, languages, except, works, on, azerbaijani, dialectology, use, the, following, notations, for, dialectal, consonants, examples, the, vowels, of, the, azerbaijani, are, in, alphabetical, order, a, e, e, i, i, o, o, u, u, y, the, typical, phonetic, quality, of, south, azerbaijani, vowels, is, as, follows, the, modern, azerbaijani, latin, alphabet, contains, the, digraphs, ov, and, v, to, represent, diphthongs, present, in, the, language, and, the, pronunciation, of, diphthongs, is, today, accepted, as, the, norm, in, the, orthophony, of, azerbaijani, despite, this, the, number, and, even, the, existence, of, diphthongs, in, azerbaijani, has, been, disputed, with, some, linguists, such, as, abdulazal, damirchizade, arguing, that, they, are, non, phonemic, damirchizade, s, view, was, challenged, by, others, such, as, aghamusa, akhundov, who, argued, that, damirchizade, was, taking, orthography, as, the, basis, of, his, judgement, rather, than, its, phonetic, value, according, to, akhundov, azerbaijani, contains, two, diphthongs, ou, and, y, represented, by, ov, and, v, in, the, alphabet, both, of, which, are, phonemic, due, to, their, contrast, with, o, and, represented, by, o, and, in, some, cases, a, non, syllabic, v, can, also, be, pronounced, after, the, aforementioned, diphthongs, to, form, ou, v, and, y, v, the, rules, of, which, are, as, follows, modern, linguists, who, have, examined, azerbaijani, s, vowel, system, almost, unanimously, have, recognised, that, diphthongs, are, phonetically, produced, in, speech, before, 1929, azerbaijani, was, written, only, in, the, perso, arabic, alphabet, an, impure, abjad, that, does, not, represent, all, vowels, without, diacritical, marks, in, iran, the, process, of, standardization, of, orthography, started, with, the, publication, of, azerbaijani, magazines, and, newspapers, such, as, varl, q, existence, from, 1979, azerbaijani, speaking, scholars, and, literarians, showed, great, interest, in, involvement, in, such, ventures, and, in, working, towards, the, development, of, a, standard, writing, system, these, effort, culminated, in, language, seminars, being, held, in, tehran, chaired, by, the, founder, of, varl, q, javad, heyat, in, 2001, where, a, document, outlining, the, standard, orthography, and, writing, conventions, were, published, for, the, public, this, standard, of, writing, is, today, canonized, by, a, persian, azeri, turkish, dictionary, in, iran, titled, loghatn, me, ye, torki, ye, zarb, yj, ni, between, 1929, and, 1938, a, latin, alphabet, was, in, use, for, north, azerbaijani, although, it, was, different, from, the, one, used, now, from, 1938, to, 1991, the, cyrillic, script, was, used, lastly, in, 1991, the, current, latin, alphabet, was, introduced, although, the, transition, to, it, has, been, rather, slow, for, instance, until, an, aliyev, decree, on, the, matter, in, 2001, newspapers, would, routinely, write, headlines, in, the, latin, script, leaving, the, stories, in, cyrillic, the, transition, has, also, resulted, in, some, misrendering, of, as, in, dagestan, azerbaijani, is, still, written, in, cyrillic, script, the, azerbaijani, latin, alphabet, is, based, on, the, turkish, latin, alphabet, in, turn, the, turkish, latin, alphabet, was, based, on, former, azerbaijani, latin, alphabet, because, of, their, linguistic, connections, and, mutual, intelligibility, the, letters, xx, and, qq, are, available, only, in, azerbaijani, for, sounds, which, do, not, exist, as, separate, phonemes, in, turkish, northern, azerbaijani, unlike, turkish, respells, foreign, names, to, conform, with, latin, azerbaijani, spelling, e, g, bush, is, spelled, bu, and, schr, der, becomes, r, der, hyphenation, across, lines, directly, corresponds, to, spoken, syllables, except, for, geminated, consonants, which, are, hyphenated, as, two, separate, consonants, as, morphonology, considers, them, two, separate, consonants, back, to, back, but, enunciated, in, the, onset, of, the, latter, syllable, as, a, single, long, consonant, as, in, other, turkic, languages, some, samples, include, secular, invoking, deity, azerbaijani, has, informal, and, formal, ways, of, saying, things, this, is, because, there, is, a, strong, tu, vous, distinction, in, turkic, languages, like, azerbaijani, and, turkish, as, well, as, in, many, other, languages, the, informal, you, is, used, when, talking, to, close, friends, relatives, animals, or, children, the, formal, you, is, used, when, talking, to, someone, who, is, older, than, the, speaker, or, to, show, respect, to, a, professor, for, example, as, in, many, turkic, languages, personal, pronouns, can, be, omitted, and, they, are, only, added, for, emphasis, since, 1992, north, azerbaijani, has, used, a, phonetic, writing, system, so, pronunciation, is, easy, most, words, are, pronounced, exactly, as, they, are, spelled, however, the, combination, qq, in, words, is, pronounced, as, the, first, voiced, velar, stop, is, devoiced, when, it, is, geminated, such, as, in, aqqal, pronounced, t, h, j, b, n, y, ji, the, numbers, 11, 19, are, constructed, as, on, bir, and, on, iki, literally, meaning, ten, one, ten, two, and, so, on,
