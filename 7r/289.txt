scouting, also, known, as, the, scout, movement, is, a, worldwide, youth, social, movement, employing, the, scout, method, a, program, of, informal, education, with, an, emphasis, on, practical, outdoor, activities, including, camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and, sports, another, widely, recognized, movement, characteristic, is, the, scout, uniform, by, intent, hiding, all, differences, of, social, standing, in, a, country, and, encouraging, equality, with, neckerchief, and, campaign, hat, or, comparable, headwear, distinctive, uniform, insignia, include, the, fleur, de, lis, and, the, trefoil, as, well, as, merit, badges, and, other, patches, in, 1907, robert, baden, powell, a, lieutenant, general, in, the, british, army, held, a, scouting, encampment, on, brownsea, island, in, england, baden, powell, wrote, scouting, for, boys, london, 1908, partly, based, on, his, earlier, military, books, the, scout, movement, of, both, boy, scouts, and, girl, guides, renamed, to, girl, scouts, in, some, countries, was, well, established, in, the, first, decade, of, the, twentieth, century, later, programs, for, younger, children, such, as, wolf, cubs, 1916, now, cubs, and, for, older, adolescents, such, as, rovers, 1918, were, adopted, by, some, scout, organizations, in, 1910, baden, powell, formed, the, girl, guides, for, girls, in, the, united, kingdom, which, spread, internationally, as, girl, guides, and, includes, age, programs, of, brownie, guide, girl, guide, and, girl, scout, ranger, guide, in, 2007, scouting, and, guiding, together, had, over, 38, million, members, in, 216, countries, international, umbrella, organizations, include, world, organization, of, the, scout, movement, wosm, for, boys, only, and, co, educational, organizations, world, association, of, girl, guides, and, girl, scouts, wagggs, primarily, for, girls, only, organizations, but, also, accepting, co, educational, organizations, world, federation, of, independent, scouts, world, organization, of, independent, scouts, order, of, world, scouts, international, union, of, guides, and, scouts, of, europe, and, confederation, of, european, scouts, the, trigger, for, the, scouting, movement, was, the, 1908, publication, of, scouting, for, boys, written, by, robert, baden, powell, at, charterhouse, one, of, england, s, most, famous, public, schools, baden, powell, had, an, interest, in, the, outdoors, later, as, a, military, officer, baden, powell, was, stationed, in, british, india, in, the, 1880s, where, he, took, an, interest, in, military, scouting, and, in, 1884, he, published, reconnaissance, and, scouting, in, 1896, baden, powell, was, assigned, to, the, matabeleland, region, in, southern, rhodesia, now, zimbabwe, as, chief, of, staff, to, gen, frederick, carrington, during, the, second, matabele, war, in, june, 1896, he, met, here, and, began, a, lifelong, friendship, with, frederick, russell, burnham, the, american, born, chief, of, scouts, for, the, british, army, in, africa, this, was, a, formative, experience, for, baden, powell, not, only, because, he, had, the, time, of, his, life, commanding, reconnaissance, missions, into, enemy, territory, but, because, many, of, his, later, boy, scout, ideas, originated, here, during, their, joint, scouting, patrols, into, the, matobo, hills, burnham, augmented, baden, powell, s, woodcraft, skills, inspiring, him, and, sowing, seeds, for, both, the, programme, and, for, the, code, of, honour, later, published, in, scouting, for, boys, practised, by, frontiersmen, of, the, american, old, west, and, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, woodcraft, was, generally, little, known, to, the, british, army, but, well, known, to, the, american, scout, burnham, these, skills, eventually, formed, the, basis, of, what, is, now, called, scoutcraft, the, fundamentals, of, scouting, both, men, recognised, that, wars, in, africa, were, changing, markedly, and, the, british, army, needed, to, adapt, so, during, their, joint, scouting, missions, baden, powell, and, burnham, discussed, the, concept, of, a, broad, training, programme, in, woodcraft, for, young, men, rich, in, exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and, self, reliance, during, this, time, in, the, matobo, hills, baden, powell, first, started, to, wear, his, signature, campaign, hat, like, the, one, worn, by, burnham, and, acquired, his, kudu, horn, the, ndebele, war, instrument, he, later, used, every, morning, at, brownsea, island, to, wake, the, first, boy, scouts, and, to, call, them, together, in, training, courses, three, years, later, in, south, africa, during, the, second, boer, war, baden, powell, was, besieged, in, the, small, town, of, mafikeng, mafeking, by, a, much, larger, boer, army, the, mafeking, cadet, corps, was, a, group, of, youths, that, supported, the, troops, by, carrying, messages, which, freed, the, men, for, military, duties, and, kept, the, boys, occupied, during, the, long, siege, the, cadet, corps, performed, well, helping, in, the, defence, of, the, town, 1899, 1900, and, were, one, of, the, many, factors, that, inspired, baden, powell, to, form, the, scouting, movement, each, member, received, a, badge, that, illustrated, a, combined, compass, point, and, spearhead, the, badge, s, logo, was, similar, to, the, fleur, de, lis, shaped, arrowhead, that, scouting, later, adopted, as, its, international, symbol, the, siege, of, mafeking, was, the, first, time, since, his, own, childhood, that, baden, powell, a, regular, serving, soldier, had, come, into, the, same, orbit, as, civilians, women, and, children, and, discovered, for, himself, the, usefulness, of, well, trained, boys, in, the, united, kingdom, the, public, through, newspapers, followed, baden, powell, s, struggle, to, hold, mafeking, and, when, the, siege, was, broken, he, had, become, a, national, hero, this, rise, to, fame, fuelled, the, sales, of, the, small, instruction, book, he, had, written, in, 1899, about, military, scouting, and, wilderness, survival, aids, to, scouting, that, owed, much, to, what, he, had, learned, from, discussions, with, burnham, on, his, return, to, england, baden, powell, noticed, that, boys, showed, considerable, interest, in, aids, to, scouting, which, was, unexpectedly, used, by, teachers, and, youth, organizations, as, their, first, scouting, handbook, he, was, urged, to, rewrite, this, book, for, boys, especially, during, an, inspection, of, the, boys, brigade, of, which, he, was, vice, president, at, the, time, a, large, youth, movement, drilled, with, military, precision, baden, powell, thought, this, would, not, be, attractive, and, suggested, that, the, boys, brigade, could, grow, much, larger, were, scouting, to, be, used, he, studied, other, schemes, parts, of, which, he, used, for, scouting, in, july, 1906, ernest, thompson, seton, sent, baden, powell, a, copy, of, his, 1902, book, the, birchbark, roll, of, the, woodcraft, indians, seton, a, british, born, canadian, american, living, in, the, united, states, met, baden, powell, in, october, 1906, and, they, shared, ideas, about, youth, training, programs, in, 1907, baden, powell, wrote, a, draft, called, boy, patrols, in, the, same, year, to, test, his, ideas, he, gathered, 21, boys, of, mixed, social, backgrounds, from, boy, s, schools, in, the, london, area, and, a, section, of, boys, from, the, poole, parkstone, hamworthy, bournemouth, and, winton, boys, brigade, units, and, held, a, week, long, camp, in, august, on, brownsea, island, in, poole, harbour, dorset, his, organizational, method, now, known, as, the, patrol, system, and, a, key, part, of, scouting, training, allowed, the, boys, to, organize, themselves, into, small, groups, with, an, elected, patrol, leader, in, late, 1907, baden, powell, went, on, an, extensive, speaking, tour, arranged, by, his, publisher, arthur, pearson, to, promote, his, forthcoming, book, scouting, for, boys, he, had, not, simply, rewritten, his, aids, to, scouting, he, omitted, the, military, aspects, and, transferred, the, techniques, mainly, survival, skills, to, non, military, heroes, backwoodsmen, explorers, and, later, on, sailors, and, airmen, he, also, added, innovative, educational, principles, the, scout, method, by, which, he, extended, the, attractive, game, to, a, personal, mental, education, at, the, beginning, of, 1908, baden, powell, published, scouting, for, boys, in, six, fortnightly, parts, setting, out, activities, and, programmes, which, existing, youth, organisations, could, use, the, reaction, was, phenomenal, and, quite, unexpected, in, a, very, short, time, scout, patrols, were, created, up, and, down, the, country, all, following, the, principles, of, baden, powell, s, book, in, 1909, the, first, scout, rally, was, held, at, crystal, palace, in, london, to, which, 11, 000, scouts, came, and, some, girls, dressed, as, scouts, and, calling, themselves, girl, scouts, baden, powell, retired, from, the, army, and, in, 1910, he, formed, the, boy, scouts, association, and, later, the, girl, guides, by, the, time, of, the, boy, scouts, association, s, first, census, in, 1910, it, had, over, 100, 000, scouts, scouting, for, boys, was, published, in, england, later, in, 1908, in, book, form, the, book, is, now, the, fourth, bestselling, title, of, all, time, and, was, the, basis, for, the, later, american, version, of, the, boy, scout, handbook, at, the, time, baden, powell, intended, that, the, scheme, would, be, used, by, established, organizations, in, particular, the, boys, brigade, from, the, founder, william, a, smith, however, because, of, the, popularity, of, his, person, and, the, adventurous, outdoor, games, he, wrote, about, boys, spontaneously, formed, scout, patrols, and, flooded, baden, powell, with, requests, for, assistance, he, encouraged, them, and, the, scouting, movement, developed, momentum, in, 1910, baden, powell, formed, the, boy, scouts, association, in, the, united, kingdom, as, the, movement, grew, sea, scouts, air, scouts, and, other, specialized, units, were, added, to, the, program, the, scouts, law, is, for, boys, as, follows, in, his, original, book, on, boy, scouting, general, baden, powell, introduced, the, scout, promise, as, follows, before, he, becomes, a, scout, a, boy, must, take, the, scout, s, oath, thus, while, taking, this, oath, the, scout, will, stand, holding, his, right, hand, raised, level, with, his, shoulder, palm, to, the, front, thumb, resting, on, the, nail, of, the, little, finger, and, the, other, three, fingers, upright, pointing, upwards, this, is, the, scout, s, salute, and, secret, sign, the, boy, scout, movement, swiftly, established, itself, throughout, the, british, empire, soon, after, the, publication, of, scouting, for, boys, by, 1908, scouting, was, established, in, gibraltar, malta, canada, australia, new, zealand, malaya, ymca, experimental, troop, in, penang, and, south, africa, in, 1909, chile, was, the, first, country, outside, the, british, dominions, to, have, a, scouting, organization, recognized, by, baden, powell, the, first, scout, rally, held, in, 1909, at, the, crystal, palace, in, london, attracted, 10, 000, boys, and, a, number, of, girls, by, 1910, argentina, denmark, finland, france, germany, greece, india, mexico, the, netherlands, norway, russia, sweden, and, the, united, states, had, boy, scouts, the, program, initially, focused, on, boys, aged, 11, to, 18, but, as, the, movement, grew, the, need, became, apparent, for, leader, training, and, programs, for, younger, boys, older, boys, and, girls, the, first, cub, scout, and, rover, scout, programs, were, in, place, by, the, late, 1910s, they, operated, independently, until, they, obtained, official, recognition, from, their, home, country, s, scouting, organization, in, the, united, states, attempts, at, cub, programs, began, as, early, as, 1911, but, official, recognition, was, not, obtained, until, 1930, girls, wanted, to, become, part, of, the, movement, almost, as, soon, as, it, began, baden, powell, and, his, sister, agnes, baden, powell, introduced, the, girl, guides, in, 1910, a, parallel, movement, for, girls, sometimes, named, girl, scouts, agnes, baden, powell, became, the, first, president, of, the, girl, guides, when, it, was, formed, in, 1910, at, the, request, of, the, girls, who, attended, the, crystal, palace, rally, in, 1914, she, started, rosebuds, later, renamed, brownies, for, younger, girls, she, stepped, down, as, president, of, the, girl, guides, in, 1920, in, favor, of, robert, s, wife, olave, baden, powell, who, was, named, chief, guide, for, england, in, 1918, and, world, chief, guide, in, 1930, at, that, time, girls, were, expected, to, remain, separate, from, boys, because, of, societal, standards, though, co, educational, youth, groups, did, exist, by, the, 1990s, two, thirds, of, the, scout, organizations, belonging, to, wosm, had, become, co, educational, baden, powell, could, not, single, handedly, advise, all, groups, who, requested, his, assistance, early, scoutmaster, training, camps, were, held, in, london, and, yorkshire, in, 1910, and, 1911, baden, powell, wanted, the, training, to, be, as, practical, as, possible, to, encourage, other, adults, to, take, leadership, roles, so, the, wood, badge, course, was, developed, to, recognize, adult, leadership, training, the, development, of, the, training, was, delayed, by, world, war, i, and, the, first, wood, badge, course, was, not, held, until, 1919, wood, badge, is, used, by, boy, scout, associations, and, combined, boy, scout, and, girl, guide, associations, in, many, countries, gilwell, park, near, london, was, purchased, in, 1919, on, behalf, of, the, scout, association, as, an, adult, training, site, and, scouting, campsite, baden, powell, wrote, a, book, aids, to, scoutmastership, to, help, scouting, leaders, and, wrote, other, handbooks, for, the, use, of, the, new, scouting, sections, such, as, cub, scouts, and, girl, guides, one, of, these, was, rovering, to, success, written, for, rover, scouts, in, 1922, a, wide, range, of, leader, training, exists, in, 2007, from, basic, to, program, specific, including, the, wood, badge, training, important, elements, of, traditional, scouting, have, their, origins, in, baden, powell, s, experiences, in, education, and, military, training, he, was, a, 50, year, old, retired, army, general, when, he, founded, scouting, and, his, revolutionary, ideas, inspired, thousands, of, young, people, from, all, parts, of, society, to, get, involved, in, activities, that, most, had, never, contemplated, comparable, organizations, in, the, english, speaking, world, are, the, boys, brigade, and, the, non, militaristic, woodcraft, folk, however, they, never, matched, the, development, and, growth, of, scouting, aspects, of, scouting, practice, have, been, criticized, as, too, militaristic, local, influences, have, also, been, a, strong, part, of, scouting, by, adopting, and, modifying, local, ideologies, scouting, has, been, able, to, find, acceptance, in, a, wide, variety, of, cultures, in, the, united, states, scouting, uses, images, drawn, from, the, u, s, frontier, experience, this, includes, not, only, its, selection, of, animal, badges, for, cub, scouts, but, the, underlying, assumption, that, american, native, peoples, are, more, closely, connected, with, nature, and, therefore, have, special, wilderness, survival, skills, which, can, be, used, as, part, of, the, training, program, by, contrast, british, scouting, makes, use, of, imagery, drawn, from, the, indian, subcontinent, because, that, region, was, a, significant, focus, in, the, early, years, of, scouting, baden, powell, s, personal, experiences, in, india, led, him, to, adopt, rudyard, kipling, s, the, jungle, book, as, a, major, influence, for, the, cub, scouts, for, example, the, name, used, for, the, cub, scout, leader, akela, whose, name, was, also, appropriated, for, the, webelos, is, that, of, the, leader, of, the, wolf, pack, in, the, book, the, name, scouting, seems, to, have, been, inspired, by, the, important, and, romantic, role, played, by, military, scouts, performing, reconnaissance, in, the, wars, of, the, time, in, fact, baden, powell, wrote, his, original, military, training, book, aids, to, scouting, because, he, saw, the, need, for, the, improved, training, of, british, military, enlisted, scouts, particularly, in, initiative, self, reliance, and, observational, skills, the, book, s, popularity, with, young, boys, surprised, him, as, he, adapted, the, book, as, scouting, for, boys, it, seems, natural, that, the, movement, adopted, the, names, scouting, and, boy, scouts, duty, to, god, is, a, principle, of, scouting, though, it, is, applied, differently, in, various, countries, the, boy, scouts, of, america, bsa, take, a, strong, position, excluding, atheists, the, scout, association, in, the, united, kingdom, permits, variations, to, its, promise, in, order, to, accommodate, different, religious, obligations, while, for, example, in, the, predominantly, atheist, czech, republic, the, scout, oath, does, not, mention, god, altogether, with, the, organization, being, strictly, irreligious, in, 2014, united, kingdom, scouts, were, given, the, choice, of, being, able, to, make, a, variation, of, the, promise, that, replaced, duty, to, god, with, uphold, our, scout, values, scouts, canada, defines, duty, to, god, broadly, in, terms, of, adherence, to, spiritual, principles, and, leaves, it, to, the, individual, member, or, leader, whether, they, can, follow, a, scout, promise, that, includes, duty, to, god, worldwide, roughly, one, in, three, scouts, are, muslim, scouting, is, taught, using, the, scout, method, which, incorporates, an, informal, educational, system, that, emphasizes, practical, activities, in, the, outdoors, programs, exist, for, scouts, ranging, in, age, from, 6, to, 25, though, age, limits, vary, slightly, by, country, and, program, specifics, target, scouts, in, a, manner, appropriate, to, their, age, the, scout, method, is, the, principal, method, by, which, the, scouting, organizations, boy, and, girl, operate, their, units, wosm, describes, scouting, as, a, voluntary, nonpolitical, educational, movement, for, young, people, open, to, all, without, distinction, of, origin, race, or, creed, in, accordance, with, the, purpose, principles, and, method, conceived, by, the, founder, it, is, the, goal, of, scouting, to, contribute, to, the, development, of, young, people, in, achieving, their, full, physical, intellectual, social, and, spiritual, potentials, as, individuals, as, responsible, citizens, and, as, members, of, their, local, national, and, international, communities, the, principles, of, scouting, describe, a, code, of, behavior, for, all, members, and, characterize, the, movement, the, scout, method, is, a, progressive, system, designed, to, achieve, these, goals, comprising, seven, elements, law, and, promise, learning, by, doing, team, system, symbolic, framework, personal, progression, nature, and, adult, support, while, community, service, is, a, major, element, of, both, the, wosm, and, wagggs, programs, wagggs, includes, it, as, an, extra, element, of, the, scout, method, service, in, the, community, the, scout, law, and, promise, embody, the, joint, values, of, the, scouting, movement, worldwide, and, bind, all, scouting, associations, together, the, emphasis, on, learning, by, doing, provides, experiences, and, hands, on, orientation, as, a, practical, method, of, learning, and, building, self, confidence, small, groups, build, unity, camaraderie, and, a, close, knit, fraternal, atmosphere, these, experiences, along, with, an, emphasis, on, trustworthiness, and, personal, honor, help, to, develop, responsibility, character, self, reliance, self, confidence, reliability, and, readiness, which, eventually, lead, to, collaboration, and, leadership, a, program, with, a, variety, of, progressive, and, attractive, activities, expands, a, scout, s, horizon, and, bonds, the, scout, even, more, to, the, group, activities, and, games, provide, an, enjoyable, way, to, develop, skills, such, as, dexterity, in, an, outdoor, setting, they, also, provide, contact, with, the, natural, environment, since, the, birth, of, scouting, scouts, worldwide, have, taken, a, scout, promise, to, live, up, to, ideals, of, the, movement, and, subscribe, to, the, scout, law, the, form, of, the, promise, and, laws, have, varied, slightly, by, country, and, over, time, but, must, fulfil, the, requirements, of, the, wosm, to, qualify, a, national, scout, association, for, membership, the, scout, motto, be, prepared, has, been, used, in, various, languages, by, millions, of, scouts, since, 1907, less, well, known, is, the, scout, slogan, do, a, good, turn, daily, common, ways, to, implement, the, scout, method, include, having, scouts, spending, time, together, in, small, groups, with, shared, experiences, rituals, and, activities, and, emphasizing, good, citizenship, and, decision, making, by, young, people, in, an, age, appropriate, manner, weekly, meetings, often, take, place, in, local, centres, known, as, scout, dens, cultivating, a, love, and, appreciation, of, the, outdoors, and, outdoor, activities, is, a, key, element, primary, activities, include, camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and, sports, camping, is, most, often, arranged, at, the, unit, level, such, as, one, scout, troop, but, there, are, periodic, camps, known, in, the, us, as, camporees, and, jamborees, camps, occur, a, few, times, a, year, and, may, involve, several, groups, from, a, local, area, or, region, camping, together, for, a, weekend, the, events, usually, have, a, theme, such, as, pioneering, world, scout, moots, are, gatherings, originally, for, rover, scouts, but, mainly, focused, on, scout, leaders, jamborees, are, large, national, or, international, events, held, every, four, years, during, which, thousands, of, scouts, camp, together, for, one, or, two, weeks, activities, at, these, events, will, include, games, scoutcraft, competitions, badge, pin, or, patch, trading, aquatics, woodcarving, archery, and, activities, related, to, the, theme, of, the, event, in, some, countries, a, highlight, of, the, year, for, scouts, is, spending, at, least, a, week, in, the, summer, engaging, in, an, outdoor, activity, this, can, be, a, camping, hiking, sailing, or, other, trip, with, the, unit, or, a, summer, camp, with, broader, participation, at, the, council, state, or, provincial, level, scouts, attending, a, summer, camp, work, on, scout,

fishing, at, an, international, level, scouting, perceives, one, of, its, roles, as, the, promotion, of, international, harmony, and, peace, various, initiatives, are, in, train, towards, achieving, this, aim, including, the, development, of, activities, that, benefit, the, wider, community, challenge, prejudice, and, encourage, tolerance, of, diversity, such, programs, include, co, operation, with, non, scouting, organisations, including, various, ngos, the, united, nations, and, religious, institutions, as, set, out, in, the, marrakech, charter, the, scout, uniform, is, a, widely, recognized, characteristic, of, scouting, in, the, words, of, baden, powell, at, the, 1937, world, jamboree, it, hides, all, differences, of, social, standing, in, a, country, and, makes, for, equality, but, more, important, still, it, covers, differences, of, country, and, race, and, creed, and, makes, all, feel, that, they, are, members, with, one, another, of, the, one, great, brotherhood, the, original, uniform, still, widely, recognized, consisted, of, a, khaki, button, up, shirt, shorts, and, a, broad, brimmed, campaign, hat, baden, powell, also, wore, shorts, because, he, believed, that, being, dressed, like, a, scout, helped, to, reduce, the, age, imposed, distance, between, adult, and, youth, uniform, shirts, are, now, frequently, blue, orange, red, or, green, and, shorts, are, frequently, replaced, by, long, trousers, all, year, or, only, under, cold, weather, while, designed, for, smartness, and, equality, the, scout, uniform, is, also, practical, shirts, traditionally, have, thick, seams, to, make, them, ideal, for, use, in, makeshift, stretchers, scouts, were, trained, to, use, them, in, this, way, with, their, staves, a, traditional, but, deprecated, item, the, leather, straps, and, toggles, of, the, campaign, hats, or, leaders, wood, badges, could, be, used, as, emergency, tourniquets, or, anywhere, that, string, was, needed, in, a, hurry, neckerchiefs, were, chosen, as, they, could, easily, be, used, as, a, sling, or, triangular, bandage, by, a, scout, in, need, scouts, were, encouraged, to, use, their, garters, for, shock, cord, where, necessary, distinctive, insignia, for, all, are, scout, uniforms, recognized, and, worn, the, world, over, include, the, wood, badge, and, the, world, membership, badge, scouting, has, two, internationally, known, symbols, the, trefoil, is, used, by, members, of, the, world, association, of, girl, guides, and, girl, scouts, wagggs, and, the, fleur, de, lis, by, member, organizations, of, the, wosm, and, most, other, scouting, organizations, the, swastika, was, used, as, an, early, symbol, by, the, boy, scouts, association, of, the, united, kingdom, and, others, its, earliest, use, in, scouting, was, on, the, thanks, badge, introduced, in, 1911, lord, baden, powell, s, 1922, design, for, the, medal, of, merit, added, a, swastika, to, the, scout, arrowhead, to,
