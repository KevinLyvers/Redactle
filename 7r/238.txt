the, basques, b, s, k, s, bahsks, or, b, s, k, s, basks, basque, euskaldunak, spanish, vascos, french, basques, are, a, southwestern, european, ethnic, group, characterised, by, the, basque, language, a, common, culture, and, shared, genetic, ancestry, to, the, ancient, vascones, and, aquitanians, basques, are, indigenous, to, and, primarily, inhabit, an, area, traditionally, known, as, the, basque, country, basque, euskal, herria, a, region, that, is, located, around, the, western, end, of, the, pyrenees, on, the, coast, of, the, bay, of, biscay, and, straddles, parts, of, north, central, spain, and, south, western, france, the, english, word, basque, may, be, pronounced, b, s, k, or, b, s, k, and, derives, from, the, french, basque, french, itself, derived, from, gascon, basco, pronounced, cognate, with, spanish, vasco, pronounced, those, in, turn, come, from, latin, vasc, pronounced, plural, vasc, n, s, see, history, section, below, the, latin, w, generally, evolved, into, the, bilabials, b, and, in, gascon, and, spanish, probably, under, the, influence, of, basque, and, the, related, aquitanian, the, latin, w, instead, evolved, into, v, in, french, italian, and, other, romance, languages, several, coins, from, the, 2nd, and, the, 1st, centuries, bc, found, in, the, basque, country, bear, the, inscription, barscunes, the, place, in, which, they, were, minted, is, not, certain, but, is, thought, to, be, somewhere, near, pamplona, in, the, heartland, of, the, area, that, historians, believe, was, inhabited, by, the, vascones, some, scholars, have, suggested, a, celtic, etymology, based, on, bhar, s, meaning, summit, point, or, leaves, according, to, which, barscunes, may, have, meant, the, mountain, people, the, tall, ones, or, the, proud, ones, and, others, have, posited, a, relationship, to, a, proto, indo, european, root, bar, meaning, border, frontier, march, in, basque, people, call, themselves, the, euskaldunak, singular, euskaldun, formed, from, euskal, i, e, basque, language, and, dun, i, e, one, who, has, euskaldun, literally, means, a, basque, speaker, not, all, basques, are, basque, speakers, therefore, the, neologism, euskotar, plural, euskotarrak, was, coined, in, the, 19th, century, to, mean, a, basque, person, whether, basque, speaking, or, not, alfonso, irigoyen, posits, that, the, word, euskara, is, derived, from, an, ancient, basque, verb, enautsi, to, say, compare, modern, basque, esan, and, the, suffix, k, ara, way, of, doing, something, thus, euskara, would, mean, literally, way, of, saying, or, way, of, speaking, one, item, of, evidence, in, favour, of, that, hypothesis, is, found, in, the, spanish, book, compendio, historial, written, in, 1571, by, the, basque, writer, esteban, de, garibay, he, records, the, name, of, the, basque, language, as, enusquera, that, may, however, be, a, writing, mistake, in, the, 19th, century, the, basque, nationalist, activist, sabino, arana, posited, an, original, root, euzko, which, he, thought, came, from, eguzkiko, of, the, sun, related, to, the, assumption, of, an, original, solar, religion, on, the, basis, of, that, putative, root, arana, proposed, the, name, euzkadi, for, an, independent, basque, nation, composed, of, seven, basque, historical, territories, arana, s, neologism, euzkadi, in, the, regularized, spelling, euskadi, is, still, widely, used, in, both, basque, and, spanish, since, it, is, now, the, official, name, of, the, autonomous, community, of, the, basque, country, the, distinctiveness, noted, by, studies, of, classical, genetic, markers, such, as, blood, groups, and, the, apparently, pre, indo, european, nature, of, the, basque, language, has, resulted, in, a, popular, and, long, held, misleading, view, that, basques, are, living, fossils, of, the, earliest, modern, humans, who, colonised, europe, partly, for, these, reasons, anthropological, and, genetic, studies, from, the, beginning, and, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, theorized, that, the, basques, are, the, descendants, of, the, original, cro, magnons, but, although, they, are, genetically, distinctive, in, some, ways, due, to, isolation, the, basques, are, still, very, typically, european, in, their, y, dna, and, mtdna, sequences, and, in, some, other, genetic, loci, these, same, sequences, are, widespread, throughout, the, western, half, of, europe, especially, along, the, western, fringe, of, the, continent, autosomal, genetic, studies, have, confirmed, that, basques, share, close, genetic, ties, to, other, europeans, especially, with, spaniards, who, have, a, common, genetic, identity, of, over, 70, with, basques, a, homogeneity, amongst, both, their, spanish, and, french, populations, according, to, high, density, snp, genotyping, study, done, in, may, 2010, and, a, genomic, distinctiveness, relative, to, other, european, populations, studies, of, the, y, dna, haplogroups, found, that, on, their, direct, male, lineages, the, vast, majority, of, modern, basques, have, a, common, ancestry, with, other, western, europeans, namely, a, marked, predominance, of, haplogroup, r1b, df27, 70, according, to, some, this, had, initially, been, theorised, to, be, a, palaeolithic, marker, p, 1365, table, 3, but, this, theory, encountered, inconsistencies, even, prior, to, the, most, recent, chronological, re, evaluations, more, recent, studies, suggest, that, r1b, spread, up, to, western, europe, from, southwestern, eurasia, in, the, neolithic, period, or, later, between, 8, 000, and, 4, 000, years, ago, the, age, of, the, subclade, which, basques, carry, r1b, df27, is, estimated, at, 4, 200, years, ago, at, the, transition, between, the, neolithic, and, the, bronze, age, when, the, y, chromosome, landscape, of, western, europe, was, thoroughly, remodeled, in, spite, of, its, high, frequency, in, basques, y, str, internal, diversity, of, r1b, df27, is, lower, there, and, results, in, more, recent, age, estimates, implying, it, was, brought, to, the, region, from, elsewhere, next, to, the, main, lineage, r1b, high, frequencies, of, e, v65, associated, with, the, maghreb, italy, and, spain, were, found, among, basque, autochthonous, inhabitants, of, lava, province, 17, 3, biscay, province, 10, 9, and, gipuzkoa, province, 3, 3, several, ancient, dna, samples, have, been, recovered, and, amplified, from, the, iberian, and, basque, region, the, collection, of, mtdna, and, y, dna, haplogroups, sampled, there, differed, significantly, compared, to, their, modern, frequencies, the, authors, concluded, that, there, is, discontinuity, between, ancient, locals, and, modern, basques, while, basques, harbour, some, very, archaic, mtdna, lineages, they, are, not, of, undiluted, palaeolithic, ancestry, but, of, significantly, early, neolithic, origin, with, a, connection, to, the, isolate, sardinian, people, it, appears, that, some, 4, 500, years, ago, almost, all, y, dna, heritage, from, iberian, admixture, of, mesolithic, hunter, gatherers, and, neolithic, farmers, was, replaced, by, the, r1b, lineage, of, herders, from, the, steppe, and, the, basque, genetic, distinctiveness, is, a, result, of, centuries, of, low, population, size, genetic, drift, and, endogamy, in, 2015, a, new, scientific, study, of, basque, dna, was, published, which, seems, to, indicate, that, basques, are, descendants, of, neolithic, farmers, who, mixed, with, local, mesolithic, hunters, before, becoming, genetically, isolated, from, the, rest, of, europe, for, millennia, mattias, jakobsson, from, uppsala, university, in, sweden, analysed, genetic, material, from, eight, stone, age, human, skeletons, found, in, el, portal, n, cavern, in, atapuerca, northern, spain, these, individuals, lived, between, 3, 500, and, 5, 500, years, ago, after, the, transition, to, farming, in, southwest, europe, the, results, show, that, these, early, iberian, farmers, are, the, closest, ancestors, to, present, day, basques, the, findings, were, published, in, proceedings, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, of, the, united, states, of, america, according, to, the, study, the, results, show, that, the, basques, trace, their, ancestry, to, early, farming, groups, from, iberia, which, contradicts, previous, views, of, them, being, a, remnant, population, that, trace, their, ancestry, to, mesolithic, hunter, gatherer, groups, still, these, early, neolithic, farmer, ancestors, of, the, basques, did, mix, with, local, southwestern, hunter, gatherers, and, the, proportion, of, hunter, gatherer, related, admixture, into, early, farmers, also, increased, over, the, course, of, two, millennia, this, admixed, group, was, also, found, to, be, ancestral, to, other, modern, day, iberian, peoples, but, while, the, basques, remained, relatively, isolated, for, millennia, after, this, time, later, migrations, into, iberia, led, to, distinct, and, additional, admixture, in, all, other, iberian, groups, in, 2019, a, study, was, published, in, science, in, which, a, more, modern, time, transect, of, iberian, ancient, populations, including, the, basque, were, analyzed, from, their, abstract, it, says, and, we, reveal, that, present, day, basques, are, best, described, as, a, typical, iron, age, population, without, the, admixture, events, that, later, affected, the, rest, of, iberia, this, indicates, basques, were, isolated, from, admixture, with, outside, groups, since, at, least, 1000, bc, or, 3000, years, before, the, present, in, iberia, these, later, admixture, interbreeding, events, were, with, central, european, celtic, eastern, mediterranean, phoenician, greek, and, roman, northern, african, carthaginian, and, mauritanian, and, northern, european, gothic, and, frankish, populations, and, genomic, ancestry, from, them, are, found, in, varying, degrees, in, all, or, most, present, day, iberian, populations, except, albeit, to, a, limited, extent, even, there, for, the, basque, basque, tribes, were, mentioned, in, roman, times, by, strabo, and, pliny, including, the, vascones, aquitani, and, others, there, is, enough, evidence, to, support, the, hypothesis, that, at, that, time, and, later, they, spoke, old, varieties, of, the, basque, language, see, aquitanian, language, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, territory, between, the, ebro, and, garonne, rivers, was, known, as, vasconia, a, vaguely, defined, ethnic, area, and, political, entity, struggling, to, fend, off, pressure, from, the, iberian, visigothic, kingdom, and, arab, rule, to, the, south, as, well, as, the, frankish, push, from, the, north, by, the, turn, of, the, first, millennium, the, territory, of, vasconia, had, fragmented, into, different, feudal, regions, such, as, soule, and, labourd, while, south, of, the, pyrenees, the, castile, pamplona, and, the, pyrenean, counties, of, aragon, sobrarbe, ribagor, a, later, kingdom, of, aragon, and, pallars, emerged, as, the, main, regional, entities, with, basque, population, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, the, kingdom, of, pamplona, a, central, basque, realm, later, known, as, navarre, underwent, a, process, of, feudalization, and, was, subject, to, the, influence, of, its, much, larger, aragonese, castilian, and, french, neighbours, castile, deprived, navarre, of, its, coastline, by, conquering, key, western, territories, 1199, 1201, leaving, the, kingdom, landlocked, the, basques, were, ravaged, by, the, war, of, the, bands, bitter, partisan, wars, between, local, ruling, families, weakened, by, the, navarrese, civil, war, the, bulk, of, the, realm, eventually, fell, before, the, onslaught, of, the, spanish, armies, 1512, 1524, however, the, navarrese, territory, north, of, the, pyrenees, remained, beyond, the, reach, of, an, increasingly, powerful, spain, lower, navarre, became, a, province, of, france, in, 1620, nevertheless, the, basques, enjoyed, a, great, deal, of, self, government, until, the, french, revolution, 1790, and, the, carlist, wars, 1839, 1876, when, the, basques, supported, heir, apparent, carlos, v, and, his, descendants, on, either, side, of, the, pyrenees, the, basques, lost, their, native, institutions, and, laws, held, during, the, ancien, r, gime, since, then, despite, the, current, limited, self, governing, status, of, the, basque, autonomous, community, and, navarre, as, settled, by, the, spanish, constitution, many, basques, have, attempted, higher, degrees, of, self, empowerment, see, basque, nationalism, sometimes, by, acts, of, violence, labourd, lower, navarre, and, soule, were, integrated, into, the, french, department, system, starting, 1790, with, basque, efforts, to, establish, a, region, specific, political, administrative, entity, failing, to, take, off, to, date, however, in, january, 2017, a, single, agglomeration, community, was, established, for, the, basque, country, in, france, the, basque, region, is, divided, into, at, least, three, administrative, units, namely, the, basque, autonomous, community, and, navarre, in, spain, and, the, arrondissement, of, bayonne, and, the, cantons, of, maul, on, licharre, and, tardets, sorholus, in, the, d, partement, of, pyr, n, es, atlantiques, france, the, autonomous, community, a, concept, established, in, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1978, known, as, euskal, autonomia, erkidegoa, or, eae, in, basque, and, as, comunidad, aut, noma, vasca, or, cav, in, spanish, in, english, basque, autonomous, community, or, bac, is, made, up, of, the, three, spanish, provinces, of, lava, biscay, and, gipuzkoa, the, corresponding, basque, names, of, these, territories, are, araba, bizkaia, and, gipuzkoa, and, their, spanish, names, are, lava, vizcaya, and, guip, zcoa, the, bac, only, includes, three, of, the, seven, provinces, of, the, currently, called, historical, territories, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, simply, as, the, basque, country, or, euskadi, by, writers, and, public, agencies, only, considering, those, three, western, provinces, but, also, on, occasions, merely, as, a, convenient, abbreviation, when, this, does, not, lead, to, confusion, in, the, context, others, reject, this, usage, as, inaccurate, and, are, careful, to, specify, the, bac, or, an, equivalent, expression, such, as, the, three, provinces, up, to, 1978, referred, to, as, provincias, vascongadas, in, spanish, when, referring, to, this, entity, or, region, likewise, terms, such, as, the, basque, government, for, the, government, of, the, bac, are, commonly, though, not, universally, employed, in, particular, in, common, usage, the, french, term, pays, basque, basque, country, in, the, absence, of, further, qualification, refers, either, to, the, whole, basque, country, euskal, herria, in, basque, or, not, infrequently, to, the, northern, or, french, basque, country, specifically, under, spain, s, present, constitution, navarre, nafarroa, in, present, day, basque, navarra, historically, in, spanish, constitutes, a, separate, entity, called, in, present, day, basque, nafarroako, foru, erkidegoa, in, spanish, comunidad, foral, de, navarra, the, autonomous, community, of, navarre, the, government, of, this, autonomous, community, is, the, government, of, navarre, in, historical, contexts, navarre, may, refer, to, a, wider, area, and, that, the, present, day, northern, basque, province, of, lower, navarre, may, also, be, referred, to, as, part, of, nafarroa, while, the, term, high, navarre, nafarroa, garaia, in, basque, alta, navarra, in, spanish, is, also, encountered, as, a, way, of, referring, to, the, territory, of, the, present, day, autonomous, community, there, are, three, other, historic, provinces, parts, of, the, basque, country, labourd, lower, navarre, and, soule, lapurdi, nafarroa, beherea, and, zuberoa, in, basque, labourd, basse, navarre, and, soule, in, french, devoid, of, official, status, within, france, s, present, day, political, and, administrative, territorial, organization, and, only, minor, political, support, to, the, basque, nationalists, a, large, number, of, regional, and, local, nationalist, and, non, nationalist, representatives, have, waged, a, campaign, for, years, advocating, for, the, creation, of, a, separate, basque, d, partement, while, these, demands, have, gone, unheard, by, the, french, administration, there, are, 2, 123, 000, people, living, in, the, basque, autonomous, community, 279, 000, in, alava, 1, 160, 000, in, biscay, and, 684, 000, in, gipuzkoa, the, most, important, cities, in, this, region, which, serve, as, the, provinces, administrative, centers, are, bilbao, in, biscay, san, sebasti, n, in, gipuzkoa, and, vitoria, gasteiz, in, lava, the, official, languages, are, basque, and, spanish, knowledge, of, spanish, is, compulsory, under, the, spanish, constitution, article, no, 3, and, knowledge, and, usage, of, basque, is, a, right, under, the, statute, of, autonomy, article, no, 6, so, only, knowledge, of, spanish, is, virtually, universal, knowledge, of, basque, after, declining, for, many, years, during, franco, s, dictatorship, owing, to, official, persecution, is, again, on, the, rise, due, to, favorable, official, language, policies, and, popular, support, currently, about, 33, percent, of, the, population, in, the, basque, autonomous, community, speaks, basque, navarre, has, a, population, of, 601, 000, its, administrative, capital, and, main, city, also, regarded, by, many, nationalist, basques, as, the, basques, historical, capital, is, pamplona, iru, ea, in, modern, basque, only, spanish, is, an, official, language, of, navarre, and, the, basque, language, is, only, co, official, in, the, province, s, northern, region, where, most, basque, speaking, navarrese, are, concentrated, about, a, quarter, of, a, million, people, live, in, the, french, basque, country, nowadays, basque, speakers, refer, to, this, region, as, iparralde, basque, for, north, and, to, the, spanish, provinces, as, hegoalde, south, much, of, this, population, lives, in, or, near, the, bayonne, anglet, biarritz, bab, urban, belt, on, the, coast, in, basque, these, are, baiona, angelu, and, miarritze, the, basque, language, which, was, traditionally, spoken, by, most, of, the, region, s, population, outside, the, bab, urban, zone, is, today, rapidly, losing, ground, to, french, the, french, basque, country, s, lack, of, self, government, within, the, french, state, is, coupled, with, the, absence, of, official, status, for, the, basque, language, in, the, region, attempts, to, introduce, bilingualism, in, local, administration, have, so, far, met, direct, refusal, from, french, officials, large, numbers, of, basques, have, left, the, basque, country, to, settle, in, the, rest, of, spain, france, or, other, parts, of, the, world, in, different, historical, periods, often, for, economic, or, political, reasons, historically, the, basques, abroad, were, often, employed, in, shepherding, and, ranching, and, by, maritime, fisheries, and, merchants, millions, of, basque, descendants, see, basque, american, and, basque, canadian, live, in, north, america, the, united, states, canada, mainly, in, the, provinces, of, newfoundland, and, quebec, all, over, latin, america, south, africa, and, australia, miguel, de, unamuno, said, there, are, at, least, two, things, that, clearly, can, be, attributed, to, basques, the, society, of, jesus, and, the, republic, of, chile, chilean, historian, luis, thayer, ojeda, estimated, that, 48, percent, of, immigrants, to, chile, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, were, basque, estimates, range, between, 2, 5, and, 5, million, basque, descendants, live, in, chile, the, basque, have, been, a, major, if, not, the, strongest, influence, in, the, country, s, cultural, and, economic,

the, language, has, in, cultural, terms, is, given, by, the, fact, that, basques, identify, themselves, by, the, term, euskaldun, and, their, country, as, euskal, herria, literally, basque, speaker, and, country, of, the, basque, language, respectively, the, language, has, been, made, a, political, issue, by, official, spanish, and, french, policies, restricting, its, use, either, historically, or, currently, however, this, has, not, stopped, the, teaching, speaking, writing, and, cultivating, of, this, increasingly, vibrant, minority, language, this, sense, of, basque, identity, tied, to, the, local, language, does, not, only, exist, in, isolation, for, many, basques, it, is, juxtaposed, with, a, sense, of, either, spanish, or, french, identity, tied, with, the, use, of, the, spanish, and, french, languages, among, other, basques, especially, in, the, french, basque, country, regarding, the, spanish, basque, country, basques, that, don, t, have, a, sense, of, spanish, identity, make, up, an, important, part, of, the, population, as, with, many, european, states, a, regional, identity, be, it, linguistically, derived, or, otherwise, is, not, mutually, exclusive, with, the, broader, national, one, for, example, basque, rugby, union, player, for, france, imanol, harinordoquy, has, said, about, his, national, identity, i, am, french, and, basque, there, is, no, conflict, i, am, proud, of, both, i, have, friends, who, are, involved, in, the, political, side, of, things, but, that, is, not, for, me, my, only, interest, is, the, culture, the, euskera, language, the, people, our, history, and, ways, as, a, result, of, state, language, promotion, school, policies, the, effects, of, mass, media, and, migration, today, virtually, all, basques, except, for, some, children, below, school, age, speak, the, official, language, of, their, state, spanish, or, french, there, are, extremely, few, basque, monolingual, speakers, essentially, all, basque, speakers, are, bilingual, on, both, sides, of, the, border, spanish, or, french, is, typically, the, first, language, of, citizens, from, other, regions, who, often, feel, no, need, to, learn, basque, and, spanish, or, french, is, also, the, first, language, of, many, basques, all, of, which, maintains, the, dominance, of, the, state, tongues, of, both, france, and, spain, recent, basque, government, policies, aim, to, change, this, pattern, as, they, are, viewed, as, potential, threats, against, mainstream, usage, of, the, minority, tongue, the, basque, language, is, thought, to, be, a, genetic, language, isolate, in, contrast, with, other, european, languages, vast, majority, of, which, belong, to, the, broad, indo, european, language, family, another, peculiarity, of, basque, is, that, it, has, probably, been, spoken, continuously, in, situ, in, and, around, its, present, territorial, location, for, longer, than, most, other, modern, european, languages, which, are, typically, thought, to, have, been, introduced, in, historic, or, prehistoric, times, through, population, migrations, or, other, processes, of, cultural, transmission, however, popular, stereotypes, characterizing, basque, as, the, oldest, language, in, europe, and, unique, among, the, world, s, languages, may, be, misunderstood, and, lead, to, erroneous, assumptions, over, the, centuries, basque, has, remained, in, continuous, contact, with, neighboring, western, european, languages, with, which, it, has, come, to, share, numerous, lexical, properties, and, typological, features, it, is, therefore, misleading, to, exaggerate, the, outlandish, character, of, basque, basque, is, also, a, modern, language, and, is, established, as, a, written, and, printed, one, used, in, present, day, forms, of, publication, and, communication, as, well, as, a, language, spoken, and, used, in, a, very, wide, range, of, social, and, cultural, contexts, styles, and, registers, basques, have, a, close, attachment, to, their, home, etxe, a, house, home, especially, when, this, consists, of, the, traditional, self, sufficient, family, run, farm, or, baserri, a, home, in, this, context, is, synonymous, with, family, roots, some, basque, surnames, were, adapted, from, old, baserri, or, habitation, names, they, typically, related, to, a, geographical, orientation, or, other, locally, meaningful, identifying, features, such, surnames, provide, even, those, basques, whose, families, may, have, left, the, land, generations, ago, with, an, important, link, to, their, rural, family, origins, bengoetxea, the, house, of, further, down, goikoetxea, the, house, above, landaburu, top, of, the, field, errekondo, next, to, the, stream, elizalde, by, the, church, mendizabal, wide, hill, usetxe, house, of, birds, ibarretxe, house, in, the, valley, etxeberria, the, new, house, and, so, on, in, contrast, to, surrounding, regions, ancient, basque, inheritance, patterns, recognised, in, the, fueros, favoured, survival, of, the, unity, of, inherited, land, holdings, in, a, kind, of, primogeniture, these, usually, were, inherited, by, the, eldest, male, or, female, child, as, in, other, cultures, the, fate, of, other, family, members, depended, on, the, assets, of, a, family, wealthy, basque, families, tended, to, provide, for, all, children, in, some, way, while, less, affluent, families, may, have, had, only, one, asset, to, provide, to, one, child, however, this, heir, often, provided, for, the, rest, of, the, family, unlike, in, england, with, strict, primogeniture, where, the, eldest, son, inherited, everything, and, often, did, not, provide, for, others, even, though, they, were, provided, for, in, some, way, younger, siblings, had, to, make, much, of, their, living, by, other, means, mostly, after, the, advent, of, industrialisation, this, system, resulted, in, the, emigration, of, many, rural, basques, to, spain, france, or, the, americas, harsh, by, modern, standards, this, custom, resulted, in, a, great, many, enterprising, figures, of, basque, origin, who, went, into, the, world, to, earn, their, way, from, spanish, conquistadors, such, as, lope, de, aguirre, and, francisco, v, squez, de, coronado, to, explorers, missionaries, and, saints, of, the, catholic, church, such, as, francis, xavier, a, widespread, belief, that, basque, society, was, originally, matriarchal, is, at, odds, with, the, current, clearly, patrilineal, kinship, system, and, inheritance, structures, some, scholars, and, commentators, have, attempted, to, reconcile, these, points, by, assuming, that, patrilineal, kinship, represents, an, innovation, in, any, case, the, social, position, of, women, in, both, traditional, and, modern, basque, society, is, somewhat, better, than, in, neighbouring, cultures, and, women, have, a, substantial, influence, in, decisions, about, the, domestic, economy, in, the, past, some, women, participated, in, collective, magical, ceremonies, they, were, key, participants, in, a, rich, folklore, today, largely, forgotten, basque, cuisine, is, at, the, heart, of, basque, culture, influenced, by, the, neighboring, communities, and, produce, from, the, sea, and, the, land, a, 20th, century, feature, of, basque, culture, is, the, phenomenon, of, gastronomical, societies, called, txoko, in, basque, food, clubs, where, men, gather, to, cook, and, enjoy, their, own, food, until, recently, women, were, allowed, entry, only, one, day, in, the, year, cider, houses, sagardotegiak, are, popular, restaurants, in, gipuzkoa, open, for, a, few, months, while, the, cider, is, in, season, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, despite, eta, violence, ended, in, 2010, and, the, crisis, of, heavy, industries, the, basque, economic, condition, recovered, remarkably, they, emerged, from, the, franco, regime, with, a, revitalized, language, and, culture, the, basque, language, expanded, geographically, led, by, large, increases, in, the, major, urban, centers, of, pamplona, bilbao, and, bayonne, where, only, a, few, decades, ago, the, basque, language, had, all, but, disappeared, nowadays, the, number, of, basque, speakers, is, maintaining, its, level, or, increasing, slightly, traditionally, basques, have, been, mostly, catholics, in, the, 19th, century, and, well, into, the, 20th, basques, as, a, group, remained, notably, devout, and, churchgoing, in, recent, years, church, attendance, has, fallen, off, as, in, most, of, western, europe, the, region, has, been, a, source, of, missionaries, like, francis, xavier, and, michel,

disappeared, from, the, basque, community, bayonne, held, a, jewish, community, composed, mainly, of, sephardi, jews, fleeing, from, the, spanish, and, portuguese, inquisitions, there, were, also, important, jewish, and, muslim, communities, in, navarre, before, the, castilian, invasion, of, 1512, 21, nowadays, according, to, one, single, opinion, poll, only, slightly, more, than, 50, of, basques, profess, some, kind, of, belief, in, god, while, the, rest, are, either, agnostic, or, atheist, the, number, of, religious, skeptics, increases, noticeably, for, the, younger, generations, while, the, older, ones, are, more, religious, catholicism, is, by, far, the, largest, religion, in, basque, country, in, 2019, the, proportion, of, basques, that, identify, themselves, as, roman, catholic, was, 60, while, it, is, one, of, the, most, secularized, communities, of, spain, 24, 6, were, non, religious, and, 12, 3, of, basques, were, atheist, the, christianisation, of, the, basque, country, has, been, the, topic, of, some, discussion, there, are, broadly, speaking, two, views, according, to, one, christianity, arrived, in, the, basque, country, during, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, but, according, to, the, other, it, did, not, take, place, until, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, the, encyclopaedia, britannica, says, that, the, basques, were, not, christianized, until, the, tenth, century, however, and, that, their, earlier, animism, survives, in, their, folklore, the, main, issue, lies, in, the, different, interpretations, of, what, is, considered, christianisation, early, traces, of, christianity, can, be, found, in, the, major, urban, areas, from, the, 4th, century, onwards, a, bishopric, from, 589, in, pamplona, and, three, hermit, cave, concentrations, two, in, lava, one, in, navarre, that, were, in, use, from, the, 6th, century, onwards, in, this, sense, christianity, arrived, early, pre, christian, belief, seems, to, have, focused, on, a, goddess, called, mari, a, number, of, place, names, contain, her, name, which, would, suggest, these, places, were, related, to, worship, of, her, such, as, anbotoko, mari, who, appears, to, have, been, related, to, the, weather, according, to, one, tradition, she, travelled, every, seven, years, between, a, cave, on, mount, anboto, and, one, on, another, mountain, the, stories, vary, the, weather, would, be, wet, when, she, was, in, anboto, dry, when, she, was, in, alo, a, or, supelegor, or, gorbea, one, of, her, names, mari, urraca, possibly, ties, her, to, an, historical, navarrese, princess, of, the, 11th, and, 12th, century, with, other, legends, giving, her, a, brother, or, cousin, who, was, a, roman, catholic, priest, so, far, the, discussions, about, whether, the, name, mari, is, original, and, just, happened, to, coincide, closely, with, the, christian, name, mar, a, or, if, mari, is, an, early, basque, attempt, to, give, a, christian, veneer, to, pagan, worship, have, remained, speculative, at, any, rate, mari, andramari, is, one, of, the, oldest, worshipped, christian, icons, in, basque, territories, mari, s, consort, is, sugaar, this, chthonic, couple, seems, to, bear, the, superior, ethical, power, and, the, power, of, creation, and, destruction, it, s, said, that, when, they, gathered, in, the, high, caves, of, the, sacred, peaks, they, engendered, the, storms, these, meetings, typically, happened, on, friday, nights, the, day, of, historical, akelarre, or, coven, mari, was, said, to, reside, in, mount, anboto, periodically, she, crossed, the, skies, as, a, bright, light, to, reach, her, other, home, at, mount, txindoki, legends, also, speak, of, many, and, abundant, genies, like, jentilak, equivalent, to, giants, lamiak, equivalent, to, nymphs, mairuak, builders, of, the, cromlechs, or, stone, circles, literally, moors, iratxoak, imps, sorginak, witches, priestess, of, mari, and, so, on, basajaun, is, a, basque, version, of, the, woodwose, there, is, a, trickster, named, san, martin, txiki, st, martin, the, lesser, it, is, unclear, whether, neolithic, stone, structures, called, dolmens, have, a, religious, significance, or, were, built, to, house, animals, or, resting, shepherds, some, of, the, dolmens, and, cromlechs, are, burial, sites, serving, also, as, border, markers, the, jentilak, giants, on, the, other, hand, are, a, legendary, people, which, explains, the, disappearance, of, a, people, of, stone, age, culture, that, used, to, live, in, the, high, lands, and, with, no, knowledge, of, iron, many, legends, about, them, tell, that, they, were, bigger, and, taller, with, a, great, force, but, were, displaced, by, the, ferrons, or, workers, of, ironworks, foundries, until, their, total, fade, out, they, were, pagans, but, one, of, them, olentzero, accepted, christianity, and, became, a, sort, of, basque, santa, claus, they, gave, name, to, several, toponyms, as, jentilbaratza, historically, basque, society, can, be, described, as, being, somewhat, at, odds, with, roman, and, later, european, societal, norms, strabo, s, account, of, the, north, of, spain, in, his, geographica, written, between, approximately, 20, bc, and, 20, ad, makes, a, mention, of, a, sort, of, woman, rule, not, at, all, a, mark, of, civilization, hadington, 1992, a, first, mention, of, the, for, the, period, unusual, position, of, women, women, could, inherit, and, control, property, as, well, as, officiate, in, churches, the, evidence, for, this, assertion, is, rather, sparse, however, this, preference, for, female, dominance, existed, well, into, the, 20th, century, matrilineal, inheritance, laws, and, agricultural, work, performed, by, women, continued, in, basque, country, until, the, early, twentieth, century, for, more, than, a, century, scholars, have, widely, discussed, the, high, status, of, basque, women, in, law, codes, as, well, as, their, positions, as, judges, inheritors, and, arbitrators, through, ante, roman, medieval, and, modern, times, the, system, of, laws, governing, succession, in, the, french, basque, region, reflected, total, equality, between, the, sexes, up, until, the, eve, of, the, french, revolution, the, basque, woman, was, truly, the, mistress, of, the, house, hereditary, guardian, and, head, of, the, lineage, while, women, continued, to, have, a, higher, position, in, basque, than, other, western, european, societies, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, any, point, the, society, was, matriarchal, as, is, often, falsely, claimed, about, pre, indo, european, peoples, in, general, the, basque, matriarchy, argument, is, typically, tied, to, 20th, century, nationalism, and, is, at, odds, with, earlier, accounts, of, the, society, although, the, kingdom, of, navarre, did, adopt, feudalism, most, basques, also, possessed, unusual, social, institutions, different, from, those, of, the, rest, of, feudal, europe, some, aspects, of, this, include, the, elizate, tradition, where, local, house, owners, met, in, front, of, the, church, to, elect, a, representative, to, send, to, the, juntas, and, juntas, generales, such, as, the, juntas, generales, de, vizcaya, or, guip, zcoa, which, administered, much, larger, areas, another, example, was, that, in, the, medieval, period, most, land, was, owned, by, the, farmers, not, the, church, or, a, king, the, great, family, of, ball, games, has, its, unique, offspring, among, basque, ball, games, known, generically, as, pilota, spanish, pelota, some, variants, have, been, exported, to, the, united, states, and, macau, under, the, name, of, jai, alai, there, are, several, sports, derived, by, basques, from, everyday, chores, heavy, workers, were, challenged, and, bets, placed, upon, them, examples, are, the, encierro, bull, run, in, pamplona, s, fiestas, sanfermines, started, as, a, transport, of, bulls, to, the, ring, these, encierros, as, well, as, other, bull, and, bullock, related, activities, are, not, exclusive, to, pamplona, but, are, traditional, in, many, towns, and, villages, of, the, basque, country, there, are, several, clubs, within, the, basque, country, such, as, athletic, bilbao, real, sociedad, deportivo, alav, s, sd, eibar, and, as, navarre, club, the, ca, osasuna, the, only, club, in, la, liga, that, has, a, basque, name, osasuna, means, health, in, the, 2016, 17, season, these, five, clubs, played, together, in, la, liga, the, first, instance, where, five, basque, clubs, have, reached, that, level, at, the, same, time, athletic, s, recruitment, policy, has, meant, the, club, refuses, to, sign, any, non, basque, players, with, basque, currently, defined, to, include, either, ethnic, basques, or, players, of, any, ethnicity, trained, by, a, basque, club, real, sociedad, also, previously, employed, such, a, policy, the, basque, country, also, features, several, professional, basketball, teams, the, most, notable, of, which, is, saski, baskonia, from, vitoria, gasteiz, one, of, the, 11, clubs, that, own, stakes, in, euroleague, basketball, the, company, that, operates, the, continent, wide, euroleague,

is, primarily, a, historical, consequence, and, an, answer, to, the, wide, autonomy, claim, of, its, population, navarre, has, a, separate, statute, of, autonomy, a, contentious, arrangement, designed, during, spanish, transition, to, democracy, the, amejoramiento, an, upgrade, of, its, previous, status, during, dictatorship, it, refers, back, to, the, kingdom, status, of, navarre, up, to, 1841, and, their, traditional, institutional, and, legal, framework, charters, basque, the, original, and, main, language, of, navarre, up, to, the, late, 18th, century, has, kept, family, transmission, especially, in, the, northern, part, of, navarre, and, central, areas, to, a, lesser, extent, designated, as, basque, speaking, or, mixed, area, in, navarrese, law, questions, of, political, linguistic, and, cultural, allegiance, and, identity, are, highly, complex, in, navarre, politically, some, basque, nationalists, would, like, to, integrate, with, the, basque, autonomous, community, the, french, basque, country, today, does, not, exist, as, a, formal, political, entity, and, is, officially, simply, part, of, the, french, department, of, pyr, n, es, atlantiques, centered, in, b, arn, in, recent, years, the, number, of, mayors, of, the, region, supporting, the, creation, of, a, separate, basque, department, has, grown, to, 63, 87, so, far, their, attempts, have, been, unsuccessful, both, the, spanish, and, french, governments, have, at, times, suppressed, basque, linguistic, and, cultural, identity, the, french, republics, the, epitome, of, the, nation, state, have, a, long, history, of, attempting, the, complete, cultural, absorption, of, cultural, minority, groups, spain, has, at, most, points, in, its, history, granted, some, degree, of, linguistic, cultural, and, even, political, autonomy, to, its, basques, but, under, the, regime, of, francisco, franco, the, spanish, government, reversed, the, advances, of, basque, nationalism, as, it, had, fought, in, the, opposite, side, of, the, spanish, civil, war, cultural, activity, in, basque, was, limited, to, folkloric, issues, and, the, catholic, church, today, the, southern, basque, country, within, spain, enjoys, an, extensive, cultural, and, political, autonomy, the, majority, of, schools, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, basque, education, system, use, basque, as, the, primary, medium, of, teaching, however, the, situation, is, more, delicate, in, the, northern, basque, country, within, france, where, basque, is, not, officially, recognized, and, where, lack, of, autonomy, and, monolingual, public, schooling, in, french, exert, great, pressure, on, the, basque, language, in, navarre, basque, has, been, declared, an, endangered, language, since, the, anti, basque, and, conservative, government, of, navarrese, people, s, union, opposes, the, symbols, of, basque, culture, highlighting, a, spanish, identity, for, navarre, basque, is, also, spoken, by, immigrants, in, the, major, cities, of, spain, and, france, in, australia, in, many, parts, of, latin, america, and, in, the, united, states, especially, in, nevada, idaho, and, california, 1, since, its, articulation, by, sabino, arana, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, more, radical, currents, of, basque, nationalism, have, demanded, the, right, of, self, determination, and, even, independence, within, the, basque, country, this, element, of, basque, politics, is, often, in, balance, with, the, conception, of, the, basque, country, as, just, another, part, of, the, spanish, state, a, view, more, commonly, espoused, on, the, right, of, the, political, spectrum, in, contrast, the, desire, for, greater, autonomy, or, independence, is, particularly, common, among, leftist, basque, nationalists, the, right, of, self, determination, was, asserted, by, the, basque, parliament, in, 2002, and, 2006, since, self, determination, is, not, recognized, in, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1978, a, wide, majority, of, basques, abstained, 55, and, some, even, voted, against, it, 23, 5, in, the, ratification, referendum, of, 6, december, that, year, however, it, was, approved, by, clear, majority, overall, in, spain, 87, the, autonomous, regime, for, the, basque, country, was, approved, in, a, 1979, referendum, but, the, autonomy, of, navarre, amejoramiento, del, fuero, improvement, of, the, charter, was, never, subject, to, a, referendum, but, only, approved, by, the, navarrese, cortes, parliament, as, with, their, language, the, basques, are, clearly, a, distinct, cultural, group, in, their, region, they, regard, themselves, as, culturally, and, especially, linguistically, distinct, from, their, surrounding, neighbours, some, basques, identify, themselves, as, basques, only, whereas, others, identify, themselves, both, as, basque, and, spanish, many, basques, regard, the, designation, as, a, cultural, minority, as, incomplete, favouring, instead, the, definition, as, a, nation, the, commonly, accepted, designation, for, the, basque, people, up, to, the, rise, of, the, nation, states, and, the, definition, imposed, by, the, 1812, spanish, constitution, in, modern, times, as, a, european, people, living, in, a, highly, industrialized, area, cultural, differences, from, the, rest, of, europe, are, inevitably, blurred, although, a, conscious, cultural, identity, as, a, people, or, nation, remains, very, strong, as, does, an, identification, with, their, homeland, even, among, many, basques, who, have, emigrated, to, other, parts, of, spain, or, france, or, to, other, parts, of, the, world, the, strongest, distinction, between, the, basques, and, their, traditional, neighbours, is, linguistic, surrounded, by, romance, language, speakers, the, basques, traditionally, spoke, and, many, still, speak, a, language, that, was, not, only, non, romance, but, non, indo, european, the, prevailing, belief, amongst, basques, and, forming, part, of, their, national, identity, is, that, their, language, has, continuity, with, the, people, who, were, in, this, region, since, not, only, pre, roman, and, pre, celtic, times, but, since, the, stone, age, among, the, most, notable, basque, people, are, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, who, led, the, first, successful, expedition, to, circumnavigate, the, globe, after, ferdinand, magellan, died, mid,
