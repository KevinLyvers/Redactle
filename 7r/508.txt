freedom, of, religion, or, religious, liberty, also, known, as, freedom, of, religion, or, belief, forb, is, a, principle, that, supports, the, freedom, of, an, individual, or, community, in, public, or, private, to, manifest, religion, or, belief, in, teaching, practice, worship, and, observance, it, also, includes, the, right, not, to, profess, any, religion, or, belief, or, not, to, practise, a, religion, often, called, freedom, from, religion, the, concept, of, religious, liberty, includes, and, some, say, requires, secular, liberalism, and, excludes, authoritarian, versions, of, secularism, freedom, of, religion, is, considered, by, many, people, and, most, nations, to, be, a, fundamental, human, right, freedom, of, religion, is, protected, in, all, the, most, important, international, human, rights, conventions, such, as, the, united, nations, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, the, american, convention, on, human, rights, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, and, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, in, a, country, with, a, state, religion, freedom, of, religion, is, generally, considered, to, mean, that, the, government, permits, religious, practices, of, other, communities, besides, the, state, religion, and, does, not, persecute, believers, in, other, faiths, or, those, who, have, no, faith, in, other, countries, freedom, of, religion, includes, the, right, to, refuse, to, support, by, taxes, or, otherwise, a, state, religion, freedom, of, religion, includes, at, a, minimum, freedom, of, belief, the, right, to, believe, whatever, a, person, group, or, religion, wishes, including, all, forms, of, irreligion, such, as, atheism, humanism, existentialism, or, other, forms, of, non, belief, but, some, feel, freedom, of, religion, must, include, freedom, of, practice, the, right, to, practice, a, religion, or, belief, openly, and, outwardly, in, a, public, manner, including, the, right, not, to, practice, any, religion, a, third, term, freedom, of, worship, may, be, considered, synonymous, with, both, freedom, of, belief, and, freedom, of, practice, or, may, be, considered, to, fall, between, the, two, terms, crucial, in, the, consideration, of, religious, liberty, is, the, question, of, whether, religious, practices, and, religiously, motivated, actions, that, would, otherwise, violate, secular, law, should, be, permitted, due, to, the, safeguarding, freedom, of, religion, this, issue, is, addressed, in, numerous, court, cases, including, the, united, states, supreme, court, cases, reynolds, v, united, states, and, wisconsin, v, yoder, and, in, the, european, law, cases, of, s, a, s, v, france, as, well, as, numerous, other, jurisdictions, symbols, of, religious, freedom, are, seen, in, significant, locations, around, the, world, such, as, the, statue, of, liberty, in, new, york, representing, hope, for, religious, refugees, the, touro, synagogue, in, rhode, island, reflecting, america, s, early, commitment, to, religious, tolerance, and, the, golden, temple, in, amritsar, india, a, symbol, of, religious, inclusivity, and, freedom, of, worship, other, key, sites, include, the, bah, gardens, in, haifa, israel, which, emphasize, the, unity, of, humanity, and, freedom, of, belief, and, lutherstadt, wittenberg, in, germany, where, martin, luther, s, actions, sparked, the, reformation, symbolizing, a, fight, for, religious, reform, and, liberty, in, a, historic, setting, freedom, to, worship, has, often, been, limited, in, practice, through, punitive, taxation, repressive, social, legislation, and, political, disenfranchisement, an, example, commonly, cited, by, scholars, is, the, status, of, dhimmis, under, islamic, sharia, law, stemming, from, the, pact, of, umar, and, literally, meaning, protected, individuals, it, is, often, argued, that, non, muslims, possessing, the, dhimmi, status, in, medieval, islamic, societies, enjoyed, greater, freedoms, than, non, christians, in, most, medieval, european, societies, while, duly, noting, that, the, protection, was, limited, because, of, regulation, by, and, obligations, to, government, such, as, taxation, compare, jizya, and, zakat, and, military, service, differed, between, religions, in, modern, concepts, of, religious, freedom, the, law, is, usually, blind, to, religious, affiliation, in, antiquity, a, syncretic, point, of, view, often, allowed, communities, of, traders, to, operate, under, their, own, customs, when, street, mobs, of, separate,

subjects, to, continue, worshipping, their, own, gods, they, did, not, however, tolerate, christianity, because, of, the, christian, refusal, to, offer, honours, to, the, official, cult, of, the, emperor, until, it, was, legalised, by, the, roman, emperor, galerius, in, 311, holmes, and, bickers, note, that, as, long, as, christianity, was, treated, as, a, part, of, judaism, which, was, generally, tolerated, because, of, its, antiquity, and, its, practice, of, making, offers, on, behalf, of, the, emperor, it, enjoyed, the, same, freedom, but, the, christian, claim, to, religious,

of, worship, in, india, was, encapsulated, in, an, inscription, of, ashoka, king, piyadasi, ashok, dear, to, the, gods, honours, all, sects, the, ascetics, hermits, or, those, who, dwell, at, home, he, honours, them, with, charity, and, in, other, ways, but, the, king, dear, to, the, gods, attributes, less, importance, to, this, charity, and, these, honours, than, to, the, vow, of, seeing, the, reign, of, virtues, which, constitutes, the, essential, part, of, them, for, all, these, virtues, there, is, a, common, source, modesty, of, speech, that, is, to, say, one, must, not, exalt, one, s,

who, remained, and, converted, were, tried, as, heretics, in, the, inquisition, for, allegedly, practicing, judaism, in, secret, despite, the, persecution, of, jews, they, were, the, most, tolerated, non, catholic, faith, in, europe, however, the, latter, was, in, part, a, reaction, to, the, growing, movement, that, became, the, reformation, as, early, as, 1380, john, wycliffe, in, england, denied, transubstantiation, and, began, his, translation, of, the, bible, into, english, he, was, condemned, in, a, papal, bull, in, 1410, and, all, his, books, were, burned, in, 1414, jan, hus, a,

will, before, he, left, his, forebodings, proved, accurate, and, he, was, burned, at, the, stake, on, 6, july, 1415, the, council, also, decreed, that, wycliffe, s, remains, be, disinterred, and, cast, out, this, decree, was, not, carried, out, until, 1429, after, the, fall, of, the, city, of, granada, spain, in, 1492, the, muslim, population, was, promised, religious, freedom, by, the, treaty, of, granada, but, that, promise, was, short, lived, in, 1501, granada, s, muslims, were, given, an, ultimatum, to, either, convert, to, christianity, or, to, emigrate, the, majority, converted, but, only, superficially, continuing, to, dress, and, speak, as, they, had, before, and, to, secretly, practice, islam, the, moriscos, converts, to, christianity, were, ultimately, expelled, from, spain, between, 1609, castile, and, 1614, rest, of, spain, by, philip, iii, martin, luther, published, his, famous, 95, theses, in, wittenberg, on, 31, october, 1517, his, major, aim, was, theological, summed, up, in, the, three, basic, dogmas, of, protestantism, in, consequence, luther, hoped, to, stop, the, sale, of, indulgences, and, to, reform, the, church, from, within, in, 1521, he, was, given, the, chance, to, recant, at, the, diet, of, worms, before, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, after, he, refused, to, recant, he, was, declared, heretic, partly, for, his, own,

by, papal, bull, in, 1521, however, the, movement, continued, to, gain, ground, in, his, absence, and, spread, to, switzerland, huldrych, zwingli, preached, reform, in, z, rich, from, 1520, to, 1523, he, opposed, the, sale, of, indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and, organs, this, culminated, in, outright, war, between, the, swiss, cantons, that, accepted, protestantism, and, the, catholics, in, 1531, the, catholics, were, victorious, and, zwingli, was, killed, in, battle, the, catholic, cantons, made, peace, with, zurich, and, berne, the, defiance, of, papal, authority, proved, contagious, and, in, 1533, when, henry, viii, of, england, was, excommunicated, for, his, divorce, and, remarriage, to, anne, boleyn, he, promptly, established, a, state, church, with, bishops, appointed, by, the, crown, this, was, not, without, internal, opposition, and, thomas, more, who, had, been, his, lord, chancellor, was, executed, in, 1535, for, opposition, to,

same, kind, of, seesaw, back, and, forth, between, protestantism, and, catholicism, was, evident, in, england, when, mary, i, of, england, returned, that, country, briefly, to, the, catholic, fold, in, 1553, and, persecuted, protestants, however, her, half, sister, elizabeth, i, of, england, was, to, restore, the, church, of, england, in, 1558, this, time, permanently, and, began, to, persecute, catholics, again, the, king, james, bible, commissioned, by, king, james, i, of, england, and, published, in, 1611, proved, a, landmark, for, protestant, worship, with, official, catholic, forms, of, worship, being, banned, in, france, although, peace, was, made, between, protestants, and, catholics, at, the, peace, of, saint, germain, en, laye, in, 1570, persecution, continued, most, notably, in, the, massacre, of, saint, bartholomew, s, day, on, 24, august, 1572, in, which, thousands, of, protestants, throughout, france, were, killed, a, few, years, before, at, the, michelade, of, n, mes, in, 1567, protestants, had, massacred, the, local, catholic, clergy, the, norman, kingdom, of, sicily, under, roger, ii, was, characterized, by, its, multi, ethnic, nature, and, religious, tolerance,

bodyguards, kingdom, of, bohemia, present, day, czech, republic, enjoyed, religious, freedom, between, 1436, and, 1620, as, a, result, of, the, bohemian, reformation, and, became, one, of, the, most, liberal, countries, of, the, christian, world, during, that, period, of, time, the, so, called, basel, compacts, of, 1436, declared, the, freedom, of, religion, and, peace, between, catholics, and, utraquists, in, 1609, emperor, rudolf, ii, granted, bohemia, greater, religious, liberty, with, his, letter, of, majesty, the, privileged, position, of, the, catholic, church, in, the, czech, kingdom, was, firmly, established, after, the, battle, of, white, mountain, in, 1620, gradually, freedom, of, religion, in, bohemian, lands, came, to, an, end, and, protestants, fled, or, were, expelled, from, the, country, a, devout, catholic, emperor, ferdinand, ii, forcibly, converted, austrian, and, bohemian, protestants, in, the, meantime, in, germany, philip, melanchthon, drafted, the, augsburg, confession, as, a, common, confession, for, the, lutherans, and, the, free, territories, it, was, presented, to, charles, v, in, 1530, in, the, holy, roman, empire, charles, v, agreed, to, tolerate, lutheranism, in, 1555, at, the, peace, of, augsburg, each, state, was, to, take, the, religion, of, its, prince, but, within, those, states, there, was, not, necessarily, religious, tolerance, citizens, of, other, faiths, could, relocate, to, a, more, hospitable, environment, in, france, from, the, 1550s, many, attempts, to, reconcile, catholics, and, protestants, and, to, establish, tolerance, failed, because, the, state, was, too, weak, to, enforce, them, it, took, the, victory, of, prince, henry, iv, of, france, who, had, converted, into, protestantism, and, his, accession, to, the, throne, to, impose, religious, tolerance, formalized, in, the, edict, of, nantes, in, 1598, it, would, remain, in, force, for, over, 80, years, until, its, revocation, in, 1685, by, louis, xiv, of, france, intolerance, remained, the, norm, until, louis, xvi, who, signed, the, edict, of, versailles, 1787, then, the, constitutional, text, of, 24, december, 1789, granting, civilian, rights, to, protestants, the, french, revolution, then, abolished, state, religion, and, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, 1789, guarantees, freedom, of, religion, as, long, as, religious, activities, do, not, infringe, on, public, order, in, ways, detrimental, to, society, in, 1558, the, hungarian, diet, s, edict, of, torda, declared, free, practice, of, both, catholicism, and, lutheranism, calvinism, however, was, prohibited, calvinism, was, included, among, the, accepted, religions, in, 1564, ten, years, after, the, first, law, in, 1568, the, same, diet, under, the, chairmanship, of, king, of, hungary, and, prince, of, transylvania, john, sigismund, z, polya, john, ii, following, the, teaching, of, ferenc, d, vid, the, founder, of, the, unitarian, church, of, transylvania, extended, the, freedom, to, all, religions, declaring, that, it, is, not, allowed, to, anybody, to, intimidate, anybody, with, captivity, or, expelling, for, his, religion, act, of, religious, tolerance, and, freedom, of, conscience, his, majesty, our, lord, in, what, manner, he, together, with, his, realm, legislated, in, the, matter, of, religion, at, the, previous, diets, in, the, same, matter, now, in, this, diet, reaffirms, that, in, every, place, the, preachers, shall, preach, and, explain, the, gospel, each, according, to, his, understanding, of, it, and, if, the, congregation, like, it, well, if, not, no, one, shall, compel, them, for, their, souls, would, not, be, satisfied, but, they, shall, be, permitted, to, keep, a, preacher, whose, teaching, they, approve, therefore, none, of, the, superintendents, or, others, shall, abuse, the, preachers, no, one, shall, be, reviled, for, his, religion, by, anyone, according, to, the, previous, statutes, and, it, is, not, permitted, that, anyone, should, threaten, anyone, else, by, imprisonment, or, by, removal, from, his, post, for, his, teaching, for, faith, is, the, gift, of, god, and, this, comes, from, hearing, which, hearings, is, by, the, word, of, god, four, religions, catholicism, lutheranism, calvinism, unitarianism, were, named, as, accepted, religions, religo, recepta, having, their, representatives, in, the, transylvanian, diet, while, the, other, religions, like, the, orthodoxs, sabbatarians, and, anabaptists, were, tolerated, churches, religio, tolerata, which, meant, that, they, had, no, power, in, the, law, making, and, no, veto, rights, in, the, diet, but, they, were, not, persecuted, in, any, way, thanks, to, the, edict, of, torda, from, the, last, decades, of, the, 16th, century, transylvania, was, the, only, place, in, europe, where, so, many, religions, could, live, together, in, harmony, and, without, persecution, this, religious, freedom, ended, however, for, some, of, the, religions, of, transylvania, in, 1638, after, this, year, the, sabbatarians, begun, to, be, persecuted, and, forced, to, convert, to, one, of, the, accepted, christian, religions, of, transylvania, the, unitarians, despite, being, one, of, the, accepted, religions, started, to, be, put, under, an, ever, growing, pressure, which, culminated, after, the, habsburg, conquest, of, transylvania, 1691, also, after, the, habsburg, occupation, the, new, austrian, masters, forced, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, the, hutterite, anabaptists, who, found, a, safe, haven, in, 1621, in, transylvania, after, the, persecution, to, which, they, were, subjected, in, the, austrian, provinces, and, moravia, to, convert, to, catholicism, or, to, migrate, in, another, country, which, finally, the, anabaptists, did, leaving, transylvania, and, hungary, for, wallachia, than, from, there, to, russia, and, finally, in, the, united, states, in, the, union, of, utrecht, 20,

establishment, of, the, dutch, republic, from, 1581, to, 1795, under, calvinist, leadership, the, netherlands, became, the, most, tolerant, country, in, europe, it, granted, asylum, to, persecuted,

massachusetts, in, 1620, william, penn, the, founder, of, philadelphia, was, involved, in, a, case, which, had, a, profound, effect, upon, future, american, laws, and, those, of, england, in, a, classic, case, of, jury, nullification, the, jury, refused, to, convict, william, penn, of, preaching, a, quaker, sermon, which, was, illegal, even, though, the, jury, was, imprisoned, for, their, acquittal, they, stood, by, their, decision, and, helped, establish, the, freedom, of, religion, the, general, charter, of, jewish, liberties, known, as, the, statute, of, kalisz, was, issued, by, the, duke, of, greater, poland, boleslaus, the, pious, on, 8, september, 1264, in, kalisz, the, statute, served, as, the, basis, for, the, legal, position, of, jews, in, poland, and, led, to, the,

generally, not, tolerant, of, dissident, forms, of, worship, with, maryland, being, one, of, the, exceptions, for, example, roger, williams, found, it, necessary, to, found, a, new, colony, in, rhode, island, to, escape, persecution, in, the, theocratically, dominated, colony, of, massachusetts, the, puritans, of, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, were, the, most, active, of, the, new, england, persecutors, of, quakers, and, the, persecuting, spirit, was, shared, by, plymouth, colony, and, the, colonies, along, the, connecticut, river, in, 1660, one, of, the, most, notable, victims, of, the, religious, intolerance, was, english, quaker, mary, dyer, who, was, hanged, in, boston, massachusetts, for, repeatedly, defying, a, puritan, law, banning, quakers, from, the, colony, as, one, of, the, four, executed, quakers, known, as, the, boston, martyrs, the, hanging, of, dyer, on, the, boston, gallows, marked, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, the, puritan, theocracy, and, new, england,

however, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 19th, century, that, celebrating, christmas, became, common, in, the, boston, region, freedom, of, religion, was, first, applied, as, a, principle, of, government, in, the, founding, of, the, colony, of, maryland, founded, by, the, catholic, lord, baltimore, in, 1634, fifteen, years, later, 1649, the, maryland, toleration, act, drafted, by, lord, baltimore, provided, no, person, or, persons, shall, from, henceforth, be, any, waies, troubled, molested, or, discountenanced, for, or, in, respect, of, his, or, her, religion, nor, in, the, free,

toleration, act, was, repealed, during, the, cromwellian, era, with, the, assistance, of, protestant, assemblymen, and, a, new, law, barring, catholics, from, openly, practicing, their, religion, was, passed, in, 1657, the, catholic, lord, baltimore, regained, control, after, making, a, deal, with, the, colony, s, protestants, and, in, 1658, the, act, was, again, passed, by, the, colonial,

been, developed, by, the, puritans, and, the, separatist, congregationalists, in, massachusetts, with, religious, freedom, these, colonies, became, sanctuaries, for, persecuted, religious, minorities, catholics, and, later, on, jews, also, had, full, citizenship, and, free, exercise, of, their, religions, williams, hooker, penn, and, their, friends, were, firmly, convinced, that, freedom, of, conscience, was, the, will, of, god, williams, gave, the, most, profound, argument, as, faith, is, the, free, work, of, the, holy, spirit, it, cannot, be, forced, on, a, person, therefore, strict,

on, account, of, his, religious, opinions, or, belief, but, that, all, men, shall, be, free, to, profess, and, by, argument, to, maintain, their, opinions, in, matters, of, religion, and, that, the, same, shall, in, no, wise, diminish, enlarge, or, affect, their, civil, capacities, those, sentiments, also, found, expression, in, the, first, amendment, of, the, national, constitution, part, of,

flourishing, the, first, amendment, makes, clear, that, it, sought, to, protect, the, free, exercise, of, religion, or, what, might, be, called, free, exercise, equality, the, united, states, formally, considers, religious, freedom, in, its, foreign, relations, the, international, religious, freedom, act, of, 1998, established, the, united, states, commission, on, international, religious, freedom, which, investigates, the, records, of, over, 200, other, nations, with, respect, to, religious, freedom, and, makes, recommendations, to, submit, nations, with, egregious, records, to, ongoing, scrutiny, and, possible, economic, sanctions, many, human, rights, organizations, have, urged, the, united, states, to, be, still, more, vigorous, in, imposing, sanctions, on, countries, that, do, not, permit, or, tolerate, religious, freedom, freedom, of, religion, in, canada, is, a, constitutionally, protected, right, allowing, believers, the, freedom, to, assemble, and, worship, without, limitation, or, interference, canadian, law, goes, further, requiring, that, private, citizens, and, companies, provide, reasonable, accommodation, to, those, for, example, with, strong, religious, beliefs, the, canadian, human, rights, act, allows, an, exception, to, reasonable, accommodation, with, respect, to, religious, dress, such, as, a, sikh, turban, when, there, is, a, bona,

sacrament, in, their, rituals, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, declares, that, everyone, has, the, right, to, freedom, of, thought, conscience, and, religion, this, right, includes, freedom, to, change, his, religion, or, belief, and, freedom, either, alone, or, in, community, with, others, and, in, public, or, private, to, manifest, his, religion, or, belief, in, teaching, practice, worship, and, observance, on, 25, november, 1981, the, united, nations, general, assembly, passed, the, declaration, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, intolerance, and, of, discrimination, based, on, religion, or, belief, this, declaration, recognizes, freedom, of, religion, as, a, fundamental, human, right, in, accordance, with, several, other, instruments, of, international, law, however, the, most, substantial, binding, legal, instruments, that, guarantee, the, right, to, freedom, of, religion, that, was, passed, by, the, international, community, is, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, which, states, in, its, article, 14, states, parties, shall, respect, the, right, of, the, child, to, freedom, of, thought, conscience, and, religion, states, parties, shall, respect, the, rights, and, duties, of, the, parents, and, when, applicable, legal, guardians, to, provide, direction, to, the, child, in, the, exercise, of, his, or, her, right, in, a, manner, consistent, with, the, evolving, capacities, of, the, child, freedom, to, manifest, one, s, religion, or, beliefs, may, be, subject, only, to, such, limitations, as, are, prescribed, by, law, and, are, necessary, to, protect, public, safety, order, health, or, morals, or, the, fundamental, rights, and, freedoms, of, others, there, exists, a, united, nations, special, rapporteur, on, freedom, of, religion, or, belief, in, 1993, the, un, s, human, rights, committee, declared, that, article, 18, of, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, protects, theistic, non, theistic, and, atheistic, beliefs, as, well, as, the, right, not, to, profess, any, religion, or, belief, the, committee, further, stated, that, the, freedom, to, have, or, to, adopt, a, religion, or, belief, necessarily, entails, the, freedom, to, choose, a, religion, or, belief, including, the, right, to, replace, one, s, current, religion, or, belief, with, another, or, to, adopt, atheistic, views, signatories, to, the, convention, are, barred, from, the, use, of, threat, of, physical, force, or, penal, sanctions, to, compel, believers, or, non, believers, to, recant, their, beliefs, or, convert, despite, this, minority, religions, still, are, persecuted, in, many, parts, of, the, world, the, french, philosopher, voltaire, noted, in, his, book, on, english, society, letters, on, the, english, that, freedom, of, religion, in, a, diverse, society, was, deeply, important, to, maintaining, peace, in, that, country, that, it, was, also, important, in, understanding, why, england, at, that, time, was, more, prosperous, in, comparison, to, the, country, s, less, religiously, tolerant, european, neighbours, if, one, religion, only, were, allowed, in, england, the, government, would, very, possibly, become, arbitrary, if, there, were, but, two, the, people, would, cut, one, another, s, throats, but, as, there, are, such, a, multitude, they, all, live, happy, and, in, peace, adam, smith, in, his, book, the, wealth, of, nations, using, an, argument, first, put, forward, by, his, friend, and, contemporary, david, hume, states, that, in, the, long, run, it, is, in, the, best, interests, of, society, as, a, whole, and, the, civil, magistrate, government, in, particular, to, allow, people, to, freely, choose, their, own, religion, as, it, helps, prevent, civil, unrest, and, reduces, intolerance, so, long, as, there, are, enough, religions, and, or, religious, sects, operating, freely, in, a, society, then, they, are, all, compelled, to, moderate, their, more, controversial, and, violent, teachings, so, as, to, be, more, appealing, to, more, people, and, so, have, an, easier, time, attracting, new, converts, it, is, this, free, competition, amongst, religious, sects, for, converts, that, ensures, stability, and, tranquillity, in, the, long, run, smith, also, points, out, that, laws, that, prevent, religious, freedom, and, seek, to, preserve, the, power, and, belief, in, a, particular, religion, will, in, the, long, run, only, serve, to, weaken, and, corrupt, that, religion, as, its, leaders, and, preachers, become, complacent, disconnected, and, unpractised, in, their, ability, to, seek, and, win, over, new, converts, the, interested, and, active, zeal, of, religious, teachers, can, be, dangerous, and, troublesome, only, where, there, is, either, but, one, sect, tolerated, in, the, society, or, where, the, whole, of, a, large, society, is, divided, into, two, or, three, great, sects, the, teachers, of, each, acting, by, concert, and, under, a, regular, discipline, and, subordination, but, that, zeal, must, be, altogether, innocent, where, the, society, is, divided, into, two, or, three, hundred, or, perhaps, into, as, many, thousand, small, sects, of, which, no, one, could, be, considerable, enough, to, disturb, the, public, tranquillity, the, teachers, of, each, sect, seeing, themselves, surrounded, on, all, sides, with, more, adversaries, than, friends, would, be, obliged, to, learn, that, candour, and, moderation, which, are, so, seldom, to, be, found, among, the, teachers, of, those, great, sects, judaism, includes, multiple, streams, such, as, orthodox, reform, judaism, conservative, judaism, reconstructionist, judaism, jewish, renewal, and, humanistic, judaism, however, judaism, also, exists, in, many, forms, as, a, civilization, possessing, characteristics, known, as, peoplehood, rather, than, strictly, as, a, religion, in, the, torah, jews, are, forbidden, to, practice, idolatry, and, are, commanded, to, root, out, pagan, and, idolatrous, practices, within, their, midst, including, killing, idolaters, who, sacrifice, children, to, their, gods, or, engage, in, immoral, activities, however, these, laws, are, not, adhered, to, anymore, as, jews, have, usually, lived, among, multi, religious, communities, after, the, conquest, of, the, kingdoms, of, israel, and, judea, by, the, roman, empire, a, jewish, state, did, not, exist, until, 1948, with, the, establishment, of, the, state, of, israel, for, over, 1500, years, jewish, people, lived, under, pagan, christian, muslim, etc, rule, as, such, jewish, people, in, some, of, these, states, faced, persecution, from, the, pogroms, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, to, the, establishment, of, segregated, jewish, ghettos, during, world, war, ii, in, the, middle, east, jews, were, categorised, as, dhimmi, non, muslims, permitted, to, live, within, a, muslim, state, even, though, given, rights, within, a, muslim, state, a, dhimmi, is, still, not, equal, to, a, muslim, within, muslim, society, the, state, of, israel, was, established, as, a, jewish, and, democratic, state, after, world, war, ii, while, the, israeli, declaration, of, independence, stresses, religious, freedom, as, a, fundamental, principle, in, practice, most, of, israel, s, governments, have, depended, on, ultra, orthodox, parties, and, have, instituted, legal, barriers, that, applied, to, all, jews, regardless, of, whether, they, practiced, orthodox, judaism, however, as, a, nation, state, israel, is, very, open, towards, other, religions, and, religious, practices, including, a, public, muslim, call, to, prayer, chants, and, christian, prayer, bells, ringing, in, jerusalem, israel, has, been, evaluated, in, research, by, the, pew, organization, as, having, high, government, restrictions, on, religion, the, government, recognizes, only, orthodox, judaism, in, certain, matters, of, personal, status, and, marriages, can, only, be, performed, by, religious, authorities, the, government, provides, the, greatest, funding, to, orthodox, judaism, even, though, adherents, represent, a, minority, of, citizens, jewish, women, including, anat, hoffman, have, been, arrested, at, the, western, wall, for, praying, and, singing, while, wearing, religious, garments, the, orthodox, feel, should, be, reserved, for, men, women, of, the, wall, have, organized, to, promote, religious, freedom, at, the, wall, in, november, 2014, a, group, of, 60, non, orthodox, rabbinical, students, were, told, they, would, not, be, allowed, to, pray, in, the, knesset, synagogue, because, it, is, reserved, for, orthodox, rabbi, joel, levy, director, of, the, conservative, yeshiva, in, jerusalem, said, that, he, had, submitted, the, request, on, behalf, of, the, students, and, saw, their, shock, when, the, request, was, denied, he, noted, paradoxically, this, decision, served, as, an, appropriate, end, to, our, conversation, about, religion, and, state, in, israel, mk, dov, lipman, expressed, the, concern, that, many, knesset, workers, are, unfamiliar, with, non, orthodox, and, american, practices, and, would, view, an, egalitarian, service, in, the, synagogue, as, an, affront, the, non, orthodox, forms, of, jewish, practice, function, independently, in, israel, except, for, these, issues, of, praying, at, the, western, wall, a, january, 2022, report, by, impact, se, an, israeli, non, profit, detailed, the, amount, of, religious, tolerance, impressed, on, students, through, the, education, system, in, the, united, arab, emirates, the, jews, as, a, religious, community, section, of, the, report, starts, with, the, uae, curriculum, being, cited, as, a, tolerant, one, and, one, instilling, a, generally, positive, attitude, toward, other, non, muslims, however, besides, the, positive, examples, aimed, at, maintaining, peace, between, the, two, nations, the, report, also, highlights, the, negative, portrayal, of, jews, in, the, uae, citing, a, hadith, passage, that, preaches, believers, to, not, be, like, the, jews, as, they, may, be, unclean, or, dirty, an, islamic, educational, text, further, described, punishing, the, bani, qurayza, jews, for, purportedly, abusing, the, commitment, of, supporting, muhammad, the, textbooks, also, seem, to, have, missed, mentioning, israel, in, their, maps, or, educating, the, children, and, about, the, jewish, state, history, i, e, the, event, of, holocaust, despite, normalizing, ties, with, the, jewish, state, according, to, the, catholic, church, in, the, vatican, ii, document, on, religious, freedom, dignitatis, humanae, the, human, person, has, a, right, to, religious, freedom, which, is, described, as, immunity, from, coercion, in, civil, society, this, principle, of, religious, freedom, leaves, untouched, traditional, catholic, doctrine, on, the, moral, duty, of, men, and, societies, toward, the, true, religion, in, addition, this, right, is, to, be, recognized, in, the, constitutional, law, whereby, society, is, governed, and, thus, it, is, to, become, a, civil, right, prior, to, this, pope, pius, ix, had, written, a, document, called, the, syllabus, of, errors, the, syllabus, was, made, up, of, phrases, and, paraphrases, from, earlier, papal, documents, along, with, index, references, to, them, and, presented, as, a, list, of, condemned, propositions, it, does, not, explain, what, each, particular, proposition, means, in, its, context, or, why, it, is, wrong, but, it, cites, earlier, documents, to, which, the, reader, can, refer, for, the, pope, s, reasons, for, saying, each, proposition, is, false, among, the, statements, included, in, the, syllabus, are, every, man, is, free, to, embrace, and, profess, that, religion, which, guided, by, the, light, of, reason, he, shall, consider, true, 15, in, the, present, day, it, is, no, longer, expedient, that, the, catholic, religion, should, be, held, as, the, only, religion, of, the, state, to, the, exclusion, of, all, other, forms, of, worship, hence, it, has, been, wisely, decided, by, law, in, some, catholic, countries, that, persons, coming, to, reside, therein, shall, enjoy, the, public, exercise, of, their, own, peculiar, worship, some, orthodox, christians, especially, those, living, in, democratic, countries, support, religious, freedom, for, all, as, evidenced, by, the, position, of, the, ecumenical, patriarchate, many, protestant, christian, churches, including, some, baptists, churches, of, christ, seventh, day, adventist, church, and, main, line, churches, have, a, commitment, to, religious, freedoms, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, also, affirms, religious, freedom, however, others, such, as, african, scholar, makau, mutua, have, argued, that, christian, insistence, on, the, propagation, of, their, faith, to, native, cultures, as, an, element, of, religious, freedom, has, resulted, in, a, corresponding, denial, of, religious, freedom, to, native, traditions, and, led, to, their, destruction, as, he, states, in, the, book, produced, by, the, oslo, coalition, on, freedom, of, religion, or, belief, imperial, religions, have, necessarily, violated, individual, conscience, and, the, communal, expressions, of, africans, and, their, communities, by, subverting, african, religions, in, their, book, breaking, india, hindutva, ideologue, rajiv, malhotra, and, aravindan, neelakandan, discussed, the, us, protestant, church, funding, activities, in, india, with, the, book, arguing, that, the, funds, collected, were, being, used, not, so, much, for, the, purposes, indicated, to, sponsors, but, for, indoctrination, and, conversion, activities, they, suggest, that, india, is, the, prime, target, of, a, huge, enterprise, a, network, of, organizations, individuals, and, churches, that, they, argue, seem, intensely, devoted, to, the, task, of, creating, a, separatist, identity, history, and, even, religion, for, the, vulnerable, sections, of, india, they, suggest, that, this, nexus, of, players, includes, not, only, church, groups, government, bodies, and, related, organizations, but, also, private, think, tanks, and, academics, joel, spring, has, written, about, the, christianization, of, the, roman, empire, christianity, added, new, impetus, to, the, expansion, of, empire, increasing, the, arrogance, of, the, imperial, project, christians, insisted, that, the, gospels, and, the, church, were, the, only, valid, sources, of, religious, beliefs, imperialists, could, claim, that, they, were, both, civilizing, the, world, and, spreading, the, true, religion, by, the, 5th, century, christianity, was, thought, of, as, co, extensive, with, the, imperium, romanum, this, meant, that, to, be, human, as, opposed, to, being, a, natural, slave, was, to, be, civilized, and, christian, historian, anthony, pagden, argues, just, as, the, civitas, had, now, become, coterminous, with, christianity, so, to, be, human, to, be, that, is, one, who, was, civil, and, who, was, able, to, interpret, correctly, the, law, of, nature, one, had, now, also, to, be, christian, after, the, fifteenth, century, most, western, colonialists, rationalized, the, spread, of, empire, with, the, belief, that, they, were, saving, a, barbaric, and, pagan, world, by, spreading, christian, civilization, conversion, to, islam, is, simple, but, muslims, are, forbidden, to, convert, from, islam, to, another, religion, certain, muslim, majority, countries, are, known, for, their, restrictions, on, religious, freedom, highly, favoring, muslim, citizens, over, non, muslim, citizens, other, countries, having, the, same, restrictive, laws, tend, to, be, more, liberal, when, imposing, them, even, other, muslim, majority, countries, are, secular, and, thus, do, not, regulate, religious, belief, in, iran, the, constitution, recognizes, four, religions, whose, status, is, formally, protected, zoroastrianism, judaism, christianity, and, islam, the, constitution, however, also, set, the, groundwork, for, the, institutionalized, persecution, of, bah, s, who, have, been, subjected, to, arrests, beatings, executions, confiscation, and, destruction, of, property, and, the, denial, of, civil, rights, and, liberties, and, the, denial, of, access, to, higher, education,

field, by, requiring, that, african, religions, compete, in, the, marketplace, of, ideas, the, rights, corpus, not, only, forcibly, imposes, on, african, religions, the, obligation, to, compete, a, task, for, which, as, nonproselytizing, noncompetitive, creeds, they, are, not, historically, fashioned, but, also, protects, the, evangelizing, religions, in, their, march, towards, universalization, it, seems, inconceivable, that, the, human, rights, regime, would, have, intended, to, protect, the, right, of, certain, religions, to, destroy, others, some, indian, scholars, have, similarly, argued, that, the, right, to, propagate, religion, is, not, culturally, or, religiously, neutral, in, sri, lanka, there, have, been, debates, regarding, a, bill, on, religious, freedom, that, seeks, to, protect, indigenous, religious, traditions, from, certain, kinds, of, missionary, activities, debates, have, also, occurred, in, various, states, of, india, regarding, similar, laws, particularly, those, that, restrict, conversions, using, force, fraud, or, allurement, in, 2008, christian, solidarity, worldwide, a, christian, human, rights, non, governmental, organisation, which, specializes, in, religious, freedom, launched, an, in, depth, report, on, the, human, rights, abuses, faced, by, individuals, who, leave, islam, for, another, religion, the, report, is, the, product, of, a, year, long, research, project, in, six, countries, it, calls, on, muslim, nations, the, international, community, the, un, and, the, international, media, to, resolutely, address, the, serious, violations, of, human, rights, suffered, by, apostates, in, islam, apostasy, is, called, ridda, turning, back, and, is, considered, to, be, a, profound, insult, to, god, a, person, born, of, muslim, parents, that, rejects, islam, is, called, a, murtadd, fitri, natural, apostate, and, a, person, that, converted, to, islam, and, later, rejects, the, religion, is, called, a, murtadd, milli, apostate, from, the, community, a, female, apostate, must, be, either, executed, according, to, shafi, i, maliki, and, hanbali, schools, of, sunni, islamic, jurisprudence, fiqh, or, imprisoned, until, she, reverts, to, islam, as, advocated, by, the, sunni, hanafi, school, and, by, shi, a, scholars, ideally, the, one, performing, the, execution, of, an, apostate, must, be, an, imam, at, the, same, time, all, schools, of, islamic, jurisprudence, agree, that, any, muslim, can, kill, an, apostate, without, punishment, however, while, almost, all, scholars, agree, about, the, punishment, many, disagree, on, the, allowable, time, to, retract, the, apostasy, s, a, rahman, a, former, chief, justice, of, pakistan, argues, that, there, is, no, indication, of, the, death, penalty, for, apostasy, in, the, qur, an, javed, ahmad, ghamidi, a, prominent, islamic, scholar, who, studied, under, syed, abul, ala, maududi, amin, ahsan, islahi, says, killing, of, apostates, was, only, for, a, special, period, after, the, itmam, e, hujjat, the, law, in, germany, includes, the, concept, of, religious, maturity, religi, se, m, ndigkeit, with, a, minimum, age, for, minors, to, follow, their, own, religious, beliefs, even, if, their, parents, don, t, share, those, or, don, t, approve, children, 14, and, older, have, the, unrestricted, right, to, enter, or, exit, any, religious, community, children, 12, and, older, cannot, be, compelled, to, change, to, a, different, belief, children, 10, and, older, have, to, be, heard, before, their, parents, change, their, religious, upbringing, to, a, different, belief, there, are, similar, laws, in, austria, and, in, switzerland, religious, practice, may, also, conflict, with, secular, law, creating, debates, on, religious, freedom, for, instance, even, though, polygamy, is, permitted, in, islam, it, is, prohibited, in, secular, law, in, many, countries, this, raises, the, question, of, whether, prohibiting, the, practice, infringes, on, the, beliefs, of, certain, muslims, the, us, and, india, both, constitutionally, secular, nations, have, taken, two, views, of, this, in, india, polygamy, is, permitted, but, only, for, muslims, under, muslim, personal, law, in, the, us, polygamy, is, prohibited, for, all, this, was, a, major, source, of, conflict, between, the, us, government, and, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, in, its, early, days, and, the, united, states, until, the, church, amended, its, position, on, practicing, polygamy, similar, issues, have, also, arisen, in, the, context, of, the, religious, use, of, psychedelic, substances, by, native, american, tribes, in, the, united, states, such, as, by, the, native, american, church, in, 1955, chief, justice, of, california, roger, j, traynor, neatly, summarized, the, american, position, on, how, freedom, of, religion, cannot, imply, freedom, from, law, although, freedom, of, conscience, and, the, freedom, to, believe, are, absolute, the, freedom, to, act, is, not, but, with, respect, to, the, religious, use, of, animals, within, secular, law, and, those, acts, the, us, supreme, court, decision, in, the, case, of, the, church, of, lukumi,
