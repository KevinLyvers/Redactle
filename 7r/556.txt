how, their, property, estate, is, to, be, distributed, after, their, death, and, as, to, which, person, executor, is, to, manage, the, property, until, its, final, distribution, for, the, distribution, devolution, of, property, not, determined, by, a, will, see, inheritance, and, intestacy, though, it, has, been, thought, a, will, historically, applied, only, to, real, property, while, testament, applied, only, to, personal, property, thus, giving, rise, to, the, popular, title, of, the, document, as, last, will, and, testament, records, show, the, terms, have, been, used, interchangeably, thus, the, word, will, validly, applies, to, both, personal, and, real, property, a, will, may, also, create, a, testamentary, trust, that, is, effective, only, after, the, death, of, the, testator, throughout, most, of, the, world, the, disposition, of, a, dead, person, s, estate, has, been, a, matter, of, social, custom, according, to, plutarch, the, written, will, was, invented, by, solon, originally, it, was, a, device, intended, solely, for, men, who, died, without, an, heir, the, english, phrase, will, and, testament, is, derived, from, a, period, in, english, law, when, old, english, and, law, french, were, used, side, by, side, for, maximum, clarity, other, such, legal, doublets, include, breaking, and, entering, and, peace, and, quiet, the, concept, of, the, freedom, of, disposition, by, will, familiar, as, it, is, in, modern, england, and, the, united, states, both, generally, considered, common, law, systems, is, by, no, means, universal, in, fact, complete, freedom, is, the, exception, rather, than, the, rule, 654, civil, law, systems, often, put, restrictions, on, the, possibilities, of, disposal, see, for, example, forced, heirship, lgbt, advocates, have, pointed, to, the, inheritance, rights, of, spouses, as, desirable, for, same, sex, couples, as, well, through, same, sex, marriage, or, civil, unions, opponents, of, such, advocacy, rebut, this, claim, by, pointing, to, the, ability, of, same, sex, couples, to, disperse, their, assets, by, will, historically, however, it, was, observed, that, ven, if, a, same, sex, partner, executes, a, will, there, is, risk, that, the, survivor, will, face, prejudice, in, court, when, disgruntled, heirs, challenge, the, will, with, courts, being, more, willing, to, strike, down, wills, leaving, property, to, a, same, sex, partner, on, such, grounds, as, incapacity, or, undue, influence, types, of, wills, generally, include, some, jurisdictions, recognize, a, holographic, will, made, out, entirely, in, the, testator, s, own, hand, or, in, some, modern, formulations, with, material, provisions, in, the, testator, s, hand, the, distinctive, feature, of, a, holographic, will, is, less, that, it, is, handwritten, by, the, testator, and, often, that, it, need, not, be, witnessed, in, louisiana, this, type, of, testament, is, called, an, olographic, testament, it, must, be, entirely, written, dated, and, signed, in, the, handwriting, of, the, testator, although, the, date, may, appear, anywhere, in, the, testament, the, testator, must, sign, the, testament, at, the, end, of, the, testament, any, additions, or, corrections, must, also, be, entirely, hand, written, to, have, effect, in, england, the, formalities, of, wills, are, relaxed, for, soldiers, who, express, their, wishes, on, active, service, any, such, will, is, known, as, a, serviceman, s, will, a, minority, of, jurisdictions, even, recognize, the, validity, of, nuncupative, wills, oral, wills, particularly, for, military, personnel, or, merchant, sailors, however, there, are, often, constraints, on, the, disposition, of, property, if, such, an, oral, will, is, used, any, person, over, the, age, of, majority, and, having, testamentary, capacity, i, e, generally, being, of, sound, mind, can, make, a, will, with, or, without, the, aid, of, a, lawyer, required, content, varies, depending, on, the, jurisdiction, but, generally, includes, the, following, a, will, may, not, include, a, requirement, that, an, heir, commit, an, illegal, immoral, or, other, act, against, public, policy, as, a, condition, of, receipt, in, community, property, jurisdictions, a, will, cannot, be, used, to, disinherit, a, surviving, spouse, who, is, entitled, to, at, least, a, portion, of, the, testator, s, estate, in, the, united, states, children, may, be, disinherited, by, a, parent, s, will, except, in, louisiana, where, a, minimum, share, is, guaranteed, to, surviving, children, except, in, specifically, enumerated, circumstances, many, civil, law, countries, follow, a, similar, rule, in, england, and, wales, from, 1933, to, 1975, a, will, could, disinherit, a, spouse, however, since, the, inheritance, provision, for, family, and, dependants, act, 1975, such, an, attempt, can, be, defeated, by, a, court, order, if, it, leaves, the, surviving, spouse, or, other, entitled, dependent, without, reasonable, financial, provision, there, is, no, legal, requirement, that, a, will, be, drawn, up, by, a, lawyer, and, some, people, may, resist, hiring, a, lawyer, to, draft, a, will, people, may, draft, a, will, with, the, assistance, of, a, lawyer, use, a, software, product, or, will, form, or, write, their, wishes, entirely, on, their, own, some, lawyers, offer, educational, classes, for, people, who, want, to, write, their, own, will, when, obtained, from, a, lawyer, a, will, may, come, as, part, of, an, estate, planning, package, that, includes, other, instruments, such, as, a, living, trust, a, will, that, is, drafted, by, a, lawyer, should, avoid, possible, technical, mistakes, that, a, layperson, might, make, that, could, potentially, invalidate, part, or, all, of, a, will, while, wills, prepared, by, a, lawyer, may, seem, similar, to, each, other, lawyers, can, customize, the, language, of, wills, to, meet, the, needs, of, specific, clients, in, 1973, an, international, convention, the, convention, providing, a, uniform, law, on, the, form, of, an, international, will, was, concluded, in, the, context, of, unidroit, the, convention, provided, for, a, universally, recognised, code, of, rules, under, which, a, will, made, anywhere, by, any, person, of, any, nationality, would, be, valid, and, enforceable, in, every, country, that, became, a, party, to, the, convention, these, are, known, as, international, wills, it, is, in, force, in, australia, belgium, bosnia, herzegovina, canada, in, 9, provinces, not, quebec, croatia, cyprus, ecuador, france, italy, libya, niger, portugal, and, slovenia, the, holy, see, iran, laos, the, russian, federation, sierra, leone, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, have, signed, but, not, ratified, international, wills, are, only, valid, where, the, convention, applies, although, the, u, s, has, not, ratified, on, behalf, of, any, state, the, uniform, law, has, been, enacted, in, 23, states, and, the, district, of, columbia, for, individuals, who, own, assets, in, multiple, countries, and, at, least, one, of, those, countries, are, not, a, part, of, the, convention, it, may, be, appropriate, for, the, person, to, have, multiple, wills, one, for, each, country, in, some, nations, multiple, wills, may, be, useful, to, reduce, or, avoid, taxes, upon, the, estate, and, its, assets, care, must, be, taken, to, avoid, accidental, revocation, of, prior, wills, avoid, conflicts, between, the, wills, and, anticipate, jurisdictional, and, choice, of, law, issues, that, may, arise, during, probate, intentional, physical, destruction, of, a, will, by, the, testator, will, revoke, it, through, deliberately, burning, or, tearing, the, physical, document, itself, or, by, striking, out, the, signature, in, most, jurisdictions, partial, revocation, is, allowed, if, only, part, of, the, text, or, a, particular, provision, is, crossed, out, other, jurisdictions, will, either, ignore, the, attempt, or, hold, that, the, entire, will, was, actually, revoked, a, testator, may, also, be, able, to, revoke, by, the, physical, act, of, another, as, would, be, necessary, if, he, or, she, is, physically, incapacitated, if, this, is, done, in, their, presence, and, in, the, presence, of, witnesses, some, jurisdictions, may, presume, that, a, will, has, been, destroyed, if, it, had, been, last, seen, in, the, possession, of, the, testator, but, is, found, mutilated, or, cannot, be, found, after, their, death, a, will, may, also, be, revoked, by, the, execution, of, a, new, will, most, wills, contain, stock, language, that, expressly, revokes, any, wills, that, came, before, them, because, otherwise, a, court, will, normally, still, attempt, to, read, the, wills, together, to, the, extent, they, are, consistent, in, some, jurisdictions, the, complete, revocation, of, a, will, automatically, revives, the, next, most, recent, will, while, others, hold, that, revocation, leaves, the, testator, with, no, will, so, that, their, heirs, will, instead, inherit, by, intestate, succession, in, england, and, wales, marriage, will, automatically, revoke, a, will, for, it, is, presumed, that, upon, marriage, a, testator, will, want, to, review, the, will, a, statement, in, a, will, that, it, is, made, in, contemplation, of, forthcoming, marriage, to, a, named, person, will, override, this, divorce, conversely, will, not, revoke, a, will, but, in, many, jurisdictions, will, have, the, effect, that, the, former, spouse, is, treated, as, if, they, had, died, before, the, testator, and, so, will, not, benefit, where, a, will, has, been, accidentally, destroyed, on, evidence, that, this, is, the, case, a, copy, will, or, draft, will, may, be, admitted, to, probate, many, jurisdictions, exercise, an, equitable, doctrine, known, as, dependent, relative, revocation, drr, under, this, doctrine, courts, may, disregard, a, revocation, that, was, based, on, a, mistake, of, law, on, the, part, of, the, testator, as, to, the, effect, of, the, revocation, for, example, if, a, testator, mistakenly, believes, that, an, earlier, will, can, be, revived, by, the, revocation, of, a, later, will, the, court, will, ignore, the, later, revocation, if, the, later, will, comes, closer, to, fulfilling, the, testator, s, intent, than, not, having, a, will, at, all, the, doctrine, also, applies, when, a, testator, executes, a, second, or, new, will, and, revokes, their, old, will, under, the, mistaken, belief, that, the, new, will, would, be, valid, however, if, for, some, reason, the, new, will, is, not, valid, a, court, may, apply, the, doctrine, to, reinstate, and, probate, the, old, will, if, the, court, holds, that, the, testator, would, prefer, the, old, will, to, intestate, succession, before, applying, the, doctrine, courts, may, require, with, rare, exceptions, that, there, have, been, an, alternative, plan, of, disposition, of, the, property, that, is, after, revoking, the, prior, will, the, testator, could, have, made, an, alternative, plan, of, disposition, such, a, plan, would, show, that, the, testator, intended, the, revocation, to, result, in, the, property, going, elsewhere, rather, than, just, being, a, revoked, disposition, secondly, courts, require, either, that, the, testator, have, recited, their, mistake, in, the, terms, of, the, revoking, instrument, or, that, the, mistake, be, established, by, clear, and, convincing, evidence, for, example, when, the, testator, made, the, original, revocation, he, must, have, erroneously, noted, that, he, was, revoking, the, gift, because, the, intended, recipient, has, died, or, because, i, will, enact, a, new, will, tomorrow, drr, may, be, applied, to, restore, a, gift, erroneously, struck, from, a, will, if, the, intent, of, the, testator, was, to, enlarge, that, gift, but, will, not, apply, to, restore, such, a, gift, if, the, intent, of, the, testator, was, to, revoke, the, gift, in, favor, of, another, person, for, example, suppose, tom, has, a, will, that, bequeaths, 5, 000, to, his, secretary, alice, johnson, if, tom, crosses, out, that, clause, and, writes, 7, 000, to, alice, johnson, in, the, margin, but, does, not, sign, or, date, the, writing, in, the, margin, most, states, would, find, that, tom, had, revoked, the, earlier, provision, but, had, not, effectively, amended, his, will, to, add, the, second, however, under, drr, the, revocation, would, be, undone, because, tom, was, acting, under, the, mistaken, belief, that, he, could, increase, the, gift, to, 7, 000, by, writing, that, in, the, margin, therefore, alice, will, get, 5, 000, dollars, however, the, doctrine, of, relative, revocation, will, not, apply, if, the, interlineation, decreases, the, amount, of, the, gift, from, the, original, provision, e, g, 5, 000, to, alice, johnson, is, crossed, out, and, replaced, with, 3, 000, to, alice, johnson, without, testator, s, signature, or, the, date, in, the, margin, drr, does, not, apply, and, alice, johnson, will, take, nothing, similarly, if, tom, crosses, out, that, clause, and, writes, in, the, margin, 5, 000, to, betty, smith, without, signing, or, dating, the, writing, the, gift, to, alice, will, be, effectively, revoked, in, this, case, it, will, not, be, restored, under, the, doctrine, of, drr, because, even, though, tom, was, mistaken, about, the, effectiveness, of, the, gift, to, betty, that, mistake, does, not, affect, tom, s, intent, to, revoke, the, gift, to, alice, because, the, gift, to, betty, will, be, invalid, for, lack, of, proper, execution, that, 5, 000, will, go, to, tom, s, residuary, estate, also, referred, to, as, electing, to, take, against, the, will, in, the, united, states, many, states, have, probate, statutes, that, permit, the, surviving, spouse, of, the, decedent, to, choose, to, receive, a, particular, share, of, deceased, spouse, s, estate, in, lieu, of, receiving, the, specified, share, left, to, him, or, her, under, the, deceased, spouse, s, will, as, a, simple, example, under, iowa, law, see, code, of, iowa, section, 633, 238, 2005, archived, 2018, 06, 27, at, the, wayback, machine, the, deceased, spouse, leaves, a, will, which, expressly, devises, the, marital, home, to, someone, other, than, the, surviving, spouse, the, surviving, spouse, may, elect, contrary, to, the, intent, of, the, will, to, live, in, the, home, for, the, remainder, of, his, her, lifetime, this, is, called, a, life, estate, and, terminates, immediately, upon, the, surviving, spouse, s, death, the, historical, and, social, policy, purposes, of, such, statutes, are, to, assure, that, the, surviving, spouse, receives, a, statutorily, set, minimum, amount, of, property, from, the, decedent, historically, these, statutes, were, enacted, to, prevent, the, deceased, spouse, from, leaving, the, survivor, destitute, thereby, shifting, the, burden, of, care, to, the, social, welfare, system, in, new, york, a, surviving, spouse, is, entitled, to, one, third, of, her, deceased, spouse, s, estate, the, decedent, s, debts, administrative, expenses, and,
