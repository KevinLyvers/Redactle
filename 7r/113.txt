retirement, is, the, withdrawal, from, one, s, position, or, occupation, or, from, one, s, active, working, life, a, person, may, also, semi, retire, by, reducing, work, hours, or, workload, many, people, choose, to, retire, when, they, are, elderly, or, incapable, of, doing, their, job, for, health, reasons, people, may, also, retire, when, they, are, eligible, for, private, or, public, pension, benefits, although, some, are, forced, to, retire, when, bodily, conditions, no, longer, allow, the, person, to, work, any, longer, by, illness, or, accident, or, as, a, result, of, legislation, concerning, their, positions, in, most, countries, the, idea, of, retirement, is, of, recent, origin, being, introduced, during, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, previously, low, life, expectancy, lack, of, social, security, and, the, absence, of, pension, arrangements, meant, that, most, workers, continued, to, work, until, their, death, germany, was, the, first, country, to, introduce, retirement, benefits, in, 1889, nowadays, most, developed, countries, have, systems, to, provide, pensions, on, retirement, in, old, age, funded, by, employers, or, the, state, in, many, poorer, countries, there, is, no, support, for, the, elderly, beyond, that, provided, through, the, family, today, retirement, with, a, pension, is, considered, a, right, of, the, worker, in, many, societies, hard, ideological, social, cultural, and, political, battles, have, been, fought, over, whether, this, is, a, right, in, many, western, countries, this, is, a, right, embodied, in, national, constitutions, an, increasing, number, of, individuals, are, choosing, to, put, off, this, point, of, total, retirement, by, selecting, to, exist, in, the, emerging, state, of, pre, tirement, retirement, or, the, practice, of, leaving, one, s, job, or, ceasing, to, work, after, reaching, a, certain, age, has, been, around, since, around, the, 18th, century, prior, to, the, 18th, century, humans, had, an, average, life, expectancy, between, 26, and, 40, years, in, consequence, only, a, small, percentage, of, the, population, reached, an, age, where, physical, impairments, began, to, be, obstacles, to, working, countries, began, to, adopt, government, policies, on, retirement, during, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, 20th, century, beginning, in, germany, under, otto, von, bismarck, a, person, may, retire, at, whatever, age, they, please, however, a, country, s, tax, laws, or, state, old, age, pension, rules, usually, mean, that, in, a, given, country, a, certain, age, is, thought, of, as, the, standard, retirement, age, as, life, expectancy, increases, and, more, and, more, people, live, to, an, advanced, age, in, many, countries, the, age, at, which, a, pension, is, awarded, has, been, increased, in, the, 21st, century, often, progressively, the, standard, retirement, age, varies, from, country, to, country, but, it, is, generally, between, 50, and, 70, according, to, latest, statistics, 2011, in, some, countries, this, age, is, different, for, men, and, women, although, this, has, recently, been, challenged, in, some, countries, e, g, austria, and, in, some, countries, the, ages, are, being, brought, into, line, the, table, below, shows, the, variation, in, eligibility, ages, for, public, old, age, benefits, in, the, united, states, and, many, european, countries, according, to, the, oecd, the, retirement, age, in, many, countries, is, increasing, often, starting, in, the, 2010s, and, continuing, until, the, late, 2020s, notes, parentheses, indicate, eligibility, age, for, women, when, different, sources, cols, 1, 2, oecd, pensions, at, a, glance, 2005, cols, 3, 6, tabulations, from, hrs, elsa, and,

as, contributing, to, the, labor, market, for, at, least, 20, years, early, and, normal, retirement, ages, vary, according, to, the, date, of, birth, of, the, person, filing, for, retirement, 2, in, france, the, retirement, age, was, 60, with, full, pension, entitlement, at, 65, in, 2010, this, was, extended, to, 62, and, 67, respectively, increasing, progressively, over, the, following, eight,

receive, unreduced, benefits, it, is, gradually, increasing, to, age, 67, by, 2027, public, servants, are, often, not, covered, by, social, security, but, have, their, own, pension, programs, police, officers, in, the, united, states, may, typically, retire, at, half, pay, after, 20, years, of, service, or, three, quarter, pay, after, 30, years, allowing, retirement, from, the, early, forties,

increased, much, in, 2022, and, 2023, to, 42, years, of, work, insurance, payment, record, to, avoid, government, social, security, bankruptcy, recent, advances, in, data, collection, have, vastly, improved, the, ability, to, understand, important, relationships, between, retirement, and, factors, such, as, health, wealth, employment, characteristics, and, family, dynamics, among, others, the, most, prominent, study, for, examining, retirement, behavior, in, the, united, states, is, the, ongoing, health, and, retirement, study, hrs, first, fielded, in, 1992, the, hrs, is, a, nationally, representative, longitudinal, survey, of, adults, in, the, u, s, ages, 51, conducted, every, two, years, and, contains, a, wealth, of, information, on, such, topics, as, labor, force, participation, e, g, current, employment, job, history, retirement, plans, industry, occupation, pensions, disability, health, e, g, health, status, and, history, health, and, life, insurance, cognition, financial, variables, e, g, assets, and, income, housing, net, worth, wills, consumption, and, savings, family, characteristics, e, g, family, structure, transfers, parent, child, grandchild, sibling, information, and, a, host, of, other, topics, e, g, expectations, expenses, internet, use, risk, taking, psychosocial, time, use, 2002, and, 2004, saw, the, introductions, of, the, english, longitudinal, study, of, ageing, elsa, and, the, survey, of, health, ageing, and, retirement, in, europe, share, which, includes, respondents, from, 14, continental, european, countries, plus, israel, these, surveys, were, closely, modeled, after, the, hrs, in, the, sample, frame, design, and, content, a, number, of, other, countries, e, g, japan, south, korea, also, now, field, hrs, like, surveys, and, others, e, g, china, india, are, currently, fielding, pilot, studies, these, data, sets, have, expanded, the, ability, of, researchers, to, examine, questions, about, retirement, behavior, by, adding, a, cross, national, perspective, notes, mhas, discontinued, in, 2003, elsa, numbers, exclude, institutionalized, nursing, homes, source, borsch, supan, et, al, eds, november, 2008, health, ageing, and, retirement, in, europe, 2004, 2007, starting, the, longitudinal, dimension, many, factors, affect, people, s, retirement, decisions, retirement, funding, education, is, a, big, factor, that, affects, the, success, of, an, individual, s, retirement, experience, social, security, plays, an, important, role, because, most, individuals, solely, rely, on, social, security, as, their, only, retirement, option, when, social, security, s, trust, funds, are, expected, to, be, depleted, by, 2034, knowledge, affects, an, individual, s, retirement, decisions, by, simply, finding, more, reliable, retirement, options, such, as, individual, retirement, accounts, or, employer, sponsored, plans, in, countries, around, the, world, people, are, much, more, likely, to, retire, at, the, early, and, normal, retirement, ages, of, the, public, pension, system, e, g, ages, 62, and, 65, in, the, u, s, this, pattern, cannot, be, explained, by, different, financial, incentives, to, retire, at, these, ages, since, typically, retirement, benefits, at, these, ages, are, approximately, actuarially, fair, that, is, the, present, value, of, lifetime, pension, benefits, pension, wealth, conditional, on, retiring, at, age, a, is, approximately, the, same, as, pension, wealth, conditional, on, retiring, one, year, later, at, age, a, 1, nevertheless, a, large, literature, has, found, that, individuals, respond, significantly, to, financial, incentives, relating, to, retirement, e, g, to, discontinuities, stemming, from, the, social, security, earnings, test, or, the, tax, system, greater, wealth, tends, to, lead, to, earlier, retirement, since, wealthier, individuals, can, essentially, purchase, additional, leisure, generally, the, effect, of, wealth, on, retirement, is, difficult, to, estimate, empirically, since, observing, greater, wealth, at, older, ages, may, be, the, result, of, increased, saving, over, the, working, life, in, anticipation, of, earlier, retirement, however, many, economists, have, found, creative, ways, to, estimate, wealth, effects, on, retirement, and, typically, find, that, they, are, small, for, example, one, paper, exploits, the, receipt, of, an, inheritance, to, measure, the, effect, of, wealth, shocks, on, retirement, using, data, from, the, hrs, the, authors, find, that, receiving, an, inheritance, increases, the, probability, of, retiring, earlier, than, expected, by, 4, 4, percentage, points, or, 12, percent, relative, to, the, baseline, retirement, rate, over, an, eight, year, period, a, great, deal, of, attention, has, surrounded, how, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, and, subsequent, great, recession, are, affecting, retirement, decisions, with, the, conventional, wisdom, saying, that, fewer, people, will, retire, since, their, savings, have, been, depleted, however, recent, research, suggests, that, the, opposite, may, happen, using, data, from, the, hrs, researchers, examined, trends, in, defined, benefit, db, vs, defined, contribution, dc, pension, plans, and, found, that, those, nearing, retirement, had, only, limited, exposure, to, the, recent, stock, market, decline, and, thus, are, not, likely, to, substantially, delay, their, retirement, at, the, same, time, using, data, from, the, current, population, survey, cps, another, study, estimates, that, mass, layoffs, are, likely, to, lead, to, an, increase, in, retirement, almost, 50, larger, than, the, decrease, brought, about, by, the, stock, market, crash, so, that, on, net, retirements, are, likely, to, increase, in, response, to, the, crisis, more, information, tells, of, how, many, who, retire, will, continue, to, work, but, not, in, the, career, they, have, had, for, the, majority, of, their, life, job, openings, will, increase, in, the, next, 5, years, due, to, retirements, of, the, baby, boomer, generation, the, over, 50, population, is, actually, the, fastest, growing, labor, groups, in, the, us, a, great, deal, of, research, has, examined, the, effects, of, health, status, and, health, shocks, on, retirement, it, is, widely, found, that, individuals, in, poor, health, generally, retire, earlier, than, those, in, better, health, this, does, not, necessarily, imply, that, poor, health, status, leads, people, to, retire, earlier, since, in, surveys, retirees, may, be, more, likely, to, exaggerate, their, poor, health, status, to, justify, their, earlier, decision, to, retire, this, justification, bias, however, is, likely, to, be, small, in, general, declining, health, over, time, as, well, as, the, onset, of, new, health, conditions, have, been, found, to, be, positively, related, to, earlier, retirement, health, conditions, that, can, cause, someone, to, retire, include, hypertension, diabetes, mellitus, sleep, apnea, joint, diseases, and, hyperlipidemia, most, people, are, married, when, they, reach, retirement, age, thus, spouse, s, employment, status, may, affect, one, s, decision, to, retire, on, average, husbands, are, three, years, older, than, their, wives, in, the, u, s, and, spouses, often, coordinate, their, retirement, decisions, thus, men, are, more, likely, to, retire, if, their, wives, are, also, retired, than, if, they, are, still, in, the, labor, force, and, vice, versa, researchers, analyzed, factors, affecting, retirement, decisions, in, eu, member, states, overall, income, after, retirement, can, come, from, state, pensions, occupational, pensions, private, savings, and, investments, private, pension, funds, owned, housing, donations, e, g, by, children, and, social, benefits, in, some, countries, an, additional, lump, sum, is, granted, according, to, the, years, of, work, and, the, average, pay, this, is, usually, provided, by, the, employer, on, a, personal, level, the, rising, cost, of, living, during, retirement, is, a, serious, concern, to, many, older, adults, health, care, costs, play, an, important, role, provision, of, state, pensions, is, a, significant, drain, on, a, government, s, budget, as, life, expectancy, increases, and, the, health, of, older, people, improves, with, medical, advances, the, age, of, entitlement, to, a, pension, has, been, increasing, progressively, since, about, 2010, older, people, are, more, prone, to, sickness, and, the, cost, of, health, care, in, retirement, is, large, most, countries, provide, universal, health, insurance, coverage, for, seniors, although, in, the, united, states, many, people, retire, before, they, become, eligible, for, medicare, health, cover, at, 65, years, of, age, a, useful, and, straightforward, calculation, can, be, done, if, it, is, assumed, that, interest, after, expenses, taxes, and, inflation, is, zero, assume, that, in, real, after, inflation, terms, one, s, salary, never, changes, over, w, years, of, working, life, during, p, years, of, pension, one, has, a, living, standard, that, costs, a, replacement, ratio, r, times, as, much, as, one, s, living, standard, in, working, life, the, working, life, living, standard, is, one, s, salary, minus, the, proportion, of, salary, z, that, should, be, saved, calculations, are, per, unit, salary, e, g, assume, salary, 1, then, after, w, years, work, retirement, age, accumulated, savings, wz, to, pay, for, pension, for, p, years, necessary, savings, at, retirement, rp, 1, z, equate, these, wz, rp, 1, z, and, solve, to, give, z, rp, w, rp, for, example, if, w, 35, p, 30, and, r, 0, 65, a, proportion, z, 35, 78, should, be, saved, retirement, calculators, generally, accumulate, a, proportion, of, salary, up, to, retirement, age, this, shows, a, straightforward, case, which, nonetheless, could, be, practically, useful, for, optimistic, people, hoping, to, work, for, only, as, long, as, they, are, likely, to, be, retired, for, more, complicated, situations, there, are, several, online, retirement, calculators, on, the, internet, many, retirement, calculators, project, how, much, an, investor, needs, to, save, and, for, how, long, to, provide, a, certain, level, of, retirement, expenditures, some, retirement, calculators, appropriate, for, safe, investments, assume, a, constant, unvarying, rate, of, return, monte, carlo, retirement, calculators, take, volatility, into, account, and, project, the, probability, that, a, particular, plan, of, retirement, savings, investments, and, expenditures, will, outlast, the, retiree, retirement, calculators, vary, in, the, extent, to, which, they, take, taxes, social, security, pensions, and, other, sources, of, retirement, income, and, expenditures, into, account, the, assumptions, keyed, into, a, retirement, calculator, are, critical, one, of, the, most, important, assumptions, is, the, assumed, rate, of, real, after, inflation, investment, return, a, conservative, return, estimate, could, be, based, on, the, real, yield, of, inflation, indexed, bonds, offered, by, some, governments, including, the, united, states, canada, and, the, united, kingdom, the, tip, ter, retirement, calculator, projects, the, retirement, expenditures, that, a, portfolio, of, inflation, linked, bonds, coupled, with, other, income, sources, like, social, security, would, be, able, to, sustain, current, real, yields, on, united, states, treasury, inflation, protected, securities, tips, are, available, at, the, us, treasury, site, current, real, yields, on, canadian, real, return, bonds, are, available, at, the, bank, of, canada, s, site, as, of, december, 2011, us, treasury, inflation, linked, bonds, tips, were, yielding, about, 0, 8, real, per, annum, for, the, 30, year, maturity, and, a, noteworthy, slightly, negative, real, return, for, the, 7, year, maturity, many, individuals, use, retirement, calculators, on, the, internet, to, determine, the, proportion, of, their, pay, they, should, be, saving, in, a, tax, advantaged, plan, e, g, ira, or, 401, k, in, the, us, rrsp, in, canada, personal, pension, in, the, uk, superannuation, in, australia, after, expenses, and, any, taxes, a, reasonable, though, arguably, pessimistic, long, term, assumption, for, a, safe, real, rate, of, return, is, zero, so, in, real, terms, interest, does, not, help, the, savings, grow, each, year, of, work, must, pay, its, share, of, a, year, of, retirement, for, someone, planning, to, work, for, 40, years, and, be, retired, for, 20, years, each, year, of, work, pays, for, itself, and, for, half, a, year, of, retirement, hence, 33, 33, of, pay, must, be, saved, and, 66, 67, can, be, spent, when, earned, after, 40, years, of, saving, 33, 33, of, pay, we, have, accumulated, assets, of, 13, 33, years, of, pay, as, in, the, graph, in, the, graph, to, the, right, the, lines, are, straight, which, is, appropriate, given, the, assumption, of, a, zero, real, investment, return, the, graph, above, can, be, compared, with, those, generated, by, many, retirement, calculators, however, most, retirement, calculators, use, nominal, not, real, dollars, and, therefore, require, a, projection, of, both, the, expected, inflation, rate, and, the, expected, nominal, rate, of, return, one, way, to, work, around, this, limitation, is, to, for, example, enter, 0, return, 0, inflation, inputs, into, the, calculator, the, bloomberg, retirement, calculator, gives, the, flexibility, to, specify, for, example, zero, inflation, and, zero, investment, return, and, to, reproduce, the, graph, above, the, msn, retirement, calculator, in, 2011, has, as, the, defaults, a, realistic, 3, per, annum, inflation, rate, and, optimistic, 8, return, assumptions, consistency, with, the, december, 2011, us, nominal, bond, and, inflation, protected, bond, market, rates, requires, a, change, to, about, 3, inflation, and, 4, investment, return, before, and, after, retirement, ignoring, tax, someone, wishing, to, work, for, a, year, and, then, relax, for, a, year, on, the, same, living, standard, needs, to, save, 50, of, pay, similarly, someone, wishing, to, work, from, age, 25, to, 55, and, be, retired, for, 30, years, till, 85, needs, to, save, 50, of, pay, if, government, and, employment, pensions, are, not, a, factor, and, if, it, is, considered, appropriate, to, assume, a, zero, real, investment, return, the, problem, that, the, lifespan, is, not, known, in, advance, can, be, reduced, in, some, countries, by, the, purchase, at, retirement, of, an, inflation, indexed, life, annuity, to, pay, for, pension, assumed, for, simplicity, to, be, received, at, the, end, of, each, year, and, taking, discounted, values, in, the, manner, of, a, net, present, value, calculation, the, ideal, lump, sum, available, at, retirement, should, be, above, is, the, standard, mathematical, formula, for, the, sum, of, a, geometric, series, or, if, i, real, 0, then, the, series, in, braces, sums, to, p, since, it, then, has, p, equal, terms, as, an, example, assume, that, s, 60, 000, per, year, and, that, it, is, desired, to, replace, r, repl, 0, 80, or, 80, of, pre, retirement, living, standard, for, p, 30, years, assume, for, current, purposes, that, a, proportion, z, prop, 0, 25, 25, of, pay, was, being, saved, using, i, real, 0, 02, or, 2, per, year, real, return, on, investments, the, necessary, lump, sum, is, given, by, the, formula, as, 1, 0, 25, 0, 80, 60, 000, annuity, series, sum, 30, 36, 000, 22, 396, 806, 272, in, the, nation, s, currency, in, 2008, 2010, terms, to, allow, for, inflation, in, a, straightforward, way, it, is, best, to, talk, of, the, 806, 272, as, being, 13, 43, years, of, retirement, age, salary, it, may, be, appropriate, to, regard, this, as, being, the, necessary, lump, sum, to, fund, 36, 000, of, annual, supplements, to, any, employer, or, government, pensions, that, are, available, it, is, common, to, not, include, any, house, value, in, the, calculation, of, this, necessary, lump, sum, so, for, a, homeowner, the, lump, sum, pays, primarily, for, non, housing, living, costs, at, retirement, the, following, amount, will, have, been, accumulated, to, make, the, accumulation, match, with, the, lump, sum, needed, to, pay, pension, bring, z, prop, to, the, left, hand, side, to, give, the, answer, under, this, rough, and, unguaranteed, method, for, the, proportion, of, pay, that, should, be, saved, note, that, the, special, case, i, rel, to, pay, 0, i, real, means, that, the, geometric, series, should, be, summed, by, noting, that, there, are, p, or, w, identical, terms, and, hence, z, prop, p, w, p, this, corresponds, to, the, graph, above, with, the, straight, line, real, terms, accumulation, the, result, for, the, necessary, z, prop, given, by, ret, 03, depends, critically, on, the, assumptions, made, as, an, example, one, might, assume, that, price, inflation, will, be, 3, 5, per, year, forever, and, that, one, s, pay, will, increase, only, at, that, same, rate, of, 3, 5, if, a, 4, 5, per, year, nominal, rate, of, interest, is, assumed, then, using, 1, 045, 1, 035, in, real, terms, pre, retirement, and, post, retirement, net, interest, rates, will, remain, the, same, i, rel, to, pay, 0, 966, percent, per, year, and, i, real, 0, 966, percent, per, year, these, assumptions, may, be, reasonable, in, view, of, the, market, returns, available, on, inflation, indexed, bonds, after, expenses, and, any, tax, equation, ret, 03, is, readily, coded, in, excel, and, with, these, assumptions, gives, the, required, savings, rates, in, the, accompanying, picture, finally, a, newer, method, for, determining, the, adequacy, of, a, retirement, plan, is, monte, carlo, simulation, this, method, has, been, gaining, popularity, and, is, now, employed, by, many, financial, planners, monte, carlo, retirement, calculators, allow, users, to, enter, savings, income, and, expense, information, and, run, simulations, of, retirement, scenarios, the, simulation, results, show, the, probability, that, the, retirement, plan, will, be, successful, retirement, is, generally, considered, to, be, early, if, it, occurs, before, the, age, or, tenure, needed, for, eligibility, for, support, and, funds, from, government, or, employer, provided, sources, early, retirees, typically, rely, on, their, own, savings, and, investments, to, be, self, supporting, either, indefinitely, or, until, they, begin, receiving, external, support, early, retirement, can, also, be, used, as, a, euphemistic, term, for, being, terminated, from, employment, before, typical, retirement, age, while, conventional, wisdom, has, it, that, one, can, retire, and, take, 7, or, more, out, of, a, portfolio, year, after, year, this, strategy, would, not, have, worked, very, often, in, the, past, those, contemplating, early, retirement, will, want, to, know, if, they, have, enough, to, survive, possible, bear, markets, the, history, of, the, us, stock, market, shows, that, one, would, need, to, live, on, about, 4, of, the, initial, portfolio, per, year, to, ensure, that, the, portfolio, is, not, depleted, before, the, end, of, the, retirement, this, rule, of, thumb, is, a, summary, of, one, conclusion, of, the, trinity, study, though, the, report, is, more, nuanced, and, the, conclusions, and, very, approach, have, been, heavily, criticized, see, trinity, study, for, details, this, allows, for, increasing, the, withdrawals, with, inflation, to, maintain, a, consistent, spending, ability, throughout, the, retirement, and, to, continue, making, withdrawals, even, in, dramatic,

a, result, that, has, more, precision, some, of, these, tools, model, only, the, retirement, phase, of, the, plan, while, others, can, model, both, the, savings, or, accumulation, phase, as, well, as, the, retirement, phase, of, the, plan, for, example, an, analysis, by, forbes, reckoned, that, in, 90, of, historical, markets, a, 4, rate, would, have, lasted, for, at, least, 30, years, while, in, 50, of, the, historical, markets, a, 4, rate, would, have, been, sustained, for, more, than, 40, years, the, effects, of, making, inflation, adjusted, withdrawals, from, a, given, starting, portfolio, can, be, modeled, with, a, downloadable, spreadsheet, that, uses, historical, stock, market, data, to, estimate, likely, portfolio, returns, another, approach, is, to, employ, a, retirement, calculator, that, also, uses, historical, stock, market, modeling, but, adds, provisions, for, incorporating, pensions, other, retirement, income, and, changes, in, spending, that, may, occur, during, the, course, of, the, retirement, retirement, might, coincide, with, important, life, changes, a, retired, worker, might, move, to, a, new, location, for, example, a, retirement, community, thereby,

retiring, from, work, and, becoming, engaged, in, a, variety, of, leisure, activities, retiring, from, work, and, becoming, involved, in, a, variety, of, recreational, and, leisure, activities, retiring, from, work, and, later, returning, to, work, part, time, and, retiring, from, work, and, later, returning, to, work, full, time, an, important, note, to, make, from, these, lifestyle, definitions, are, that, four, of, the, six, involve, working, america, is, facing, an, important, demographic, change, in, that, the, baby, boomer, generation, is, now, reaching, retirement, age, this, poses, two, challenges, whether, there, will, be, a, sufficient, number, of, skilled, workers, in, the, work, force, and, whether, the, current, pension, programs, will, be, sufficient, to, support, the, growing, number, of, retired, people, the, reasons, that, some, people, choose, to, never, retire, or, to, return, to, work, after, retiring, include, not, only, the, difficulty, of, planning, for, retirement, but, also, wages, and, fringe, benefits, expenditure, of, physical, and, mental, energy, production, of, goods, and, services, social, interaction, and, social, status, may,

gives, them, more, time, to, devote, to, a, hobby, or, sport, such, as, golf, or, sailing, on, the, other, hand, many, retirees, feel, restless, and, suffer, from, depression, as, a, result, of, their, new, situation, the, newly, retired, are, one, of, the, most, vulnerable, social, groups, to, become, depressed, most, likely, due, to, retirement, coinciding, with, a, deteriorating, health, status, and, increased, care, giving, responsibilities, retirement, coincides, with, deterioration, of, one, s, health, that, correlates, with, increasing, age, and, this, likely, plays, a, major, role, in, increased, rates, of, depression, in, retirees, longitudinal, and, cross, sectional, studies, have, shown, that, healthy, elderly, and, retired, people, are, as, happy, or, happier, and, have, an, equal, quality, of, life, as, they, age, as, compared, to, younger, employed, adults, therefore, retirement, in, and, of, itself, is, not, likely, to, contribute, to, development, of, depression, research, around, what, retirees, would, ideally, like, to, have, a, fulfilling, life, after, retiring, found, the, most, important, factors, were, physical, comfort, social, integration,
