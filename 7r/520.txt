through, forced, debt, however, the, trafficking, victims, protection, act, of, 2000, us, does, not, require, movement, for, the, offence, the, issue, becomes, contentious, when, the, element, of, coercion, is, removed, from, the, definition, to, incorporate, facilitation, of, consensual, involvement, in, prostitution, for, example, in, the, united, kingdom, the, sexual, offences, act, 2003, incorporated, trafficking, for, sexual, exploitation, but, did, not, require, those, committing, the, offence, to, use, coercion, deception, or, force, so, that, it, also, includes, any, person, who,

especially, among, children, at, the, same, time, critical, scholars, have, questioned, the, extent, of, the, role, of, internet, in, human, trafficking, and, have, cautioned, against, sweeping, generalisations, and, urged, more, research, while, globalization, fostered, new, technologies, that, may, exacerbate, human, trafficking, technology, can, also, be, used, to, assist, law,

in, the, adult, section, on, super, bowl, sunday, in, contrast, sundays, typically, have, the, lowest, number, of, posts, researchers, analyzed, the, most, salient, terms, in, these, online, ads, which, suggested, that, many, escorts, were, traveling, across, state, lines, to, dallas, specifically, for, the, super, bowl, and, found, that, the, self, reported, ages, were, higher, than, usual, twitter, was, another, social, networking, platform, studied, for, detecting, sex, trafficking, digital, tools, can, be, used, to, narrow, the, pool, of, sex, trafficking, cases, albeit, imperfectly, and, with, uncertainty, however, there, has, been, no, evidence, found, actually, linking, the, super, bowl, or, any, other, sporting, event, to, increased, trafficking, or, prostitution, corrupt, and, inadequately, trained, police, officers, can, be, complicit, in, human, trafficking, and, or, commit, violence, against, sex, workers, including, trafficked, victims, human, traffickers, often, incorporate, abuse, of, the, legal, system, into, their, control, tactics, by, making, threats, of, deportation, or, by, turning, victims, into, the, authorities, possibly, resulting, in, the, incarceration, of, the, victims, anti, trafficking, agendas, from, different, groups, can, also, be, in, conflict, in, the, movement, for, sex, workers, rights, sex, workers, establish, unions, and, organizations, which, seek, to, eliminate, trafficking, however, law, enforcement, also, seek, to, eliminate, trafficking, and, to, prosecute, trafficking, and, their, work, may, infringe, on, sex, workers, rights, and, agency, for, example, the, sex, workers, union, dmsc, durbar, mahila, samanwaya, committee, in, kolkata, india, has, self, regulatory, boards, srbs, that, patrol, the, red,

on, the, grounds, that, police, action, might, have, an, adverse, impact, on, non, trafficked, sex, workers, especially, because, police, officers, in, many, places, are, corrupt, and, violent, in, their, operations, a, recent, seven, country, research, by, the, global, alliance, against, traffic, in, women, found, that, sex, worker, organizations, around, the, world, assist, women, in, the, industry, who, are, trafficked, and, should, be, considered, as, allies, in, anti, trafficking, work, criminalization, of, sex, work, also, may, foster, the, underground, market, for, sex, work, and, enable, sex, trafficking, difficult, political, situations, such, as, civil, war, and, social, conflict, are, push, factors, for, migration, and, trafficking, a, study, reported, that, larger, countries, the, richest, and, the, poorest, countries, and, countries, with, restricted, press, freedom, are, likely, to, have, higher, levels, of, trafficking, specifically, being, in, a, transitional, economy, made, a, country, nineteen, times, more, likely, to, be, ranked, in, the, highest, trafficking, category, and, gender, inequalities, in, a, country, s, labour, market, also, correlated, with, higher, trafficking, rates, the, annual, u, s, state, department, trafficking, in, persons, report, for, 2013, cited, russia, and, china, as, among, the, worst, offenders, in, combatting, forced, labour, and, sex, trafficking, raising, the, possibility, of, us, sanctions, being, leveraged, against, these, countries, in, 1997, alone, as, many, as, 175, 000, young, women, from, russia, the, former, soviet, union, and, eastern, and, central, europe, were, sold, as, commodities, in, the, sex, markets, of, the, developed, countries, in, europe, and, the, americas, abolitionists, who, seek, an, end, to, sex, trafficking, explain, the, nature, of, sex, trafficking, as, an, economic, supply, and, demand, model, in, this, model, male, demand, for, prostitutes, leads, to, a, market, of, sex, work, which, in, turn, fosters, sex, trafficking, the, illegal, trade, and, coercion, of, people, into, sex, work, and, pimps, and, traffickers, become, distributors, who, supply, people, to, be, sexually, exploited, the, demand, for, sex, trafficking, can, also, be, facilitated, by, some, pimps, and, traffickers, desire, for, women, whom, they, can, exploit, as, workers, because, they, do, not, require, wages, safe, working, circumstances, and, agency, in, choosing, customers, the, link, between, demand, for, paid, sex, and, incidences, of, human, trafficking, as, well, as, the, demand, for, trafficking, discourse, more, broadly, have, never, been, proven, empirically, and, have, been, seriously, questioned, by, a, number, of, scholars, and, organisations, to, this, day, the, idea, that, trafficking, is, fuelled, by, demand, remains, poorly, conceptualised, and, based, on, assumptions, rather, than, evidence, the, u, s, state, department, s, annual, trafficking, in, persons, report, for, 2016, stated, that, refugees, and, migrants, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and, intersex, lgbti, individuals, religious, minorities, people, with, disabilities, and, those, who, are, stateless, are, the, most, at, risk, for, human, trafficking, additionally, in, its, protocol, to, prevent, suppress, and, punish, trafficking, in, persons, especially, women, and, children, the, united, nations, notes, that, women, and, children, are, particularly, at, risk, for, human, trafficking, and, revictimization, the, protocol, requires, state, parties, not, only, to, enact, measures, that, prevent, human, trafficking, but, also, to, address, the, factors, that, exacerbate, women, and, children, s, vulnerability, including, poverty, underdevelopment, and, lack, of, equal, opportunity, human, trafficking, victims, face, threats, of, violence, from, many, sources, including, customers, pimps, brothel, owners, madams, traffickers, and, corrupt, local, law, enforcement, officials, and, even, from, family, members, who, do, not, want, to, have, any, link, with, them, because, of, their, potentially, complicated, legal, status, and, their, potential, language, barriers, the, arrest, or, fear, of, arrest, creates, stress, and, other, emotional, trauma, for, trafficking, victims, the, challenges, facing, victims, often, continue, after, their, removal, from, coercive, exploitation, in, addition, to, coping, with, their, past, traumatic, experiences, former, trafficking, victims, often, experience, social, alienation, in, the, host, and, home, countries, stigmatization, social, exclusion, and, intolerance, often, make, it, difficult, for, former, victims, to, integrate, into, their, host, community, or, to, reintegrate, into, their, former, community, accordingly, one, of, the, central, aims, of, protection, assistance, is, the, promotion, of, reintegration, too, often, however, governments, and, large, institutional, donors, offer, little, funding, to, support, the, provision, of, assistance, and, social, services, to, former, trafficking, victims, as, the, victims, are, also, pushed, into, drug, trafficking, many, of, them, face, criminal, sanctions, also, the, use, of, coercion, by, perpetrators, and, traffickers, involves, the, use, of, extreme, control, perpetrators, expose, the, victim, to, high, amounts, of, psychological, stress, induced, by, threats, fear, and, physical, and, emotional, violence, tactics, of, coercion, are, reportedly, used, in, three, phases, of, trafficking, recruitment, initiation, and, indoctrination, during, the, initiation, phase, traffickers, use, foot, in, the, door, techniques, of, persuasion, to, lead, their, victims, into, various, trafficking, industries, this, manipulation, creates, an, environment, where, the, victim, becomes, completely, dependent, upon, the, authority, of, the, trafficker, traffickers, take, advantage, of, family, dysfunction, homelessness, and, history, of, childhood, abuse, to, psychologically, manipulate, women, and, children, into, the, trafficking, industry, one, form, of, psychological, coercion, particularly, common, in, cases, of, sex, trafficking, and, forced, prostitution, is, stockholm, syndrome, many, women, entering, into, the, sex, trafficking, industry, are, minors, who, have, already, experienced, prior, sexual, abuse, traffickers, take, advantage, of, young, girls, by, luring, them, into, the, business, through, force, and, coercion, but, more, often, through, false, promises, of, love, security, and, protection, this, form, of, coercion, works, to, recruit, and, initiate, the, victim, into, the, life, of, a, sex, worker, while, also, reinforcing, a, trauma, bond, also, known, as, stockholm, syndrome, stockholm, syndrome, is, a, psychological, response, where, the, victim, becomes, attached, to, his, or, her, perpetrator, the, goal, of, a, trafficker, is, to, turn, a, human, being, into, a, slave, to, do, this, perpetrators, employ, tactics, that, can, lead, to, the, psychological, consequence, of, learned, helplessness, for, the, victims, where, they, sense, that, they, no, longer, have, any, autonomy, or, control, over, their, lives, traffickers, may, hold, their, victims, captive, expose, them, to, large, amounts, of, alcohol, or, use, drugs, keep, them, in, isolation, or, withhold, food, or, sleep, during, this, time, the, victim, often, begins, to, feel, the, onset, of, depression, guilt, and, self, blame, anger, and, rage, and, sleep, disturbances, ptsd, numbing, and, extreme, stress, under, these, pressures, the, victim, can, fall, into, the, hopeless, mental, state, of, learned, helplessness, for, victims, specifically, trafficked, for, the, purpose, of, forced, prostitution, and, sexual, slavery, initiation, into, the, trade, is, almost, always, characterized, by, violence, traffickers, employ, practices, of, sexual, abuse, torture, brainwashing, repeated, rape, and, physical, assault, until, the, victim, submits, to, his, or, her, fate, as, a, sexual, slave, victims, experience, verbal, threats, social, isolation, and, intimidation, before, they, accept, their, role, as, a, prostitute, for, those, enslaved, in, situations, of, forced, labor, learned, helplessness, can, also, manifest, itself, through, the, trauma, of, living, as, a, slave, reports, indicate, that, captivity, for, the, person, and, financial, gain, of, their, owners, adds, additional, psychological, trauma, victims, are, often, cut, off, from, all, forms, of, social, connection, as, isolation, allows, the, perpetrator, to, destroy, the, victim, s, sense, of, self, and, increase, his, or, her, dependence, on, the, perpetrator, human, trafficking, victims, may, experience, complex, trauma, as, a, result, of, repeated, cases, of, intimate, relationship, trauma, over, long, periods, of, time, including, but, not, limited, to, sexual, abuse, domestic, violence, forced, prostitution, or, gang, rape, complex, trauma, involves, multifaceted, conditions, of, depression, anxiety, self, hatred, dissociation, substance, abuse, self, destructive, behaviors, medical, and, somatic, concerns, despair, and, revictimization, psychology, researchers, report, that, although, similar, to, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, complex, trauma, is, more, expansive, in, diagnosis, because, of, the, effects, of, prolonged, trauma, victims, of, sex, trafficking, often, get, branded, by, their, traffickers, or, pimps, these, tattoos, usually, consist, of, bar, codes, or, the, trafficker, s, name, or, rules, even, if, a, victim, escapes, their, trafficker, s, control, or, gets, rescued, these, tattoos, are, painful, reminders, of, their, past, and, result, in, emotional, distress, removing, or, covering, these, tattoos, can, potentially, cost, survivors, great, sums, of, money, psychological, reviews, have, shown, that, the, chronic, stress, experienced, by, many, victims, of, human, trafficking, can, compromise, the, immune, system, several, studies, found, that, chronic, stressors, like, trauma, or, loss, suppressed, cellular, and, humoral, immunity, victims, may, develop, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, hiv, aids, perpetrators, frequently, use, substance, abuse, as, a, means, to, control, their, victims, which, leads, to, compromised, health, self, destructive, behavior, and, long, term, physical, harm, furthermore, victims, have, reported, treatment, similar, to, torture, where, their, bodies, are, broken, and, beaten, into, submission, children, are, especially, vulnerable, to, these, developmental, and, psychological, consequences, of, trafficking, due, to, their, age, in, order, to, gain, complete, control, of, the, child, traffickers, often, destroy, the, physical, and, mental, health, of, the, children, through, persistent, physical, and, emotional, abuse, victims, experience, severe, trauma, on, a, daily, basis, that, devastates, the, healthy, development, of, self, concept, self, worth, biological, integrity, and, cognitive, functioning, children, who, grow, up, in, environments, of, constant, exploitation, frequently, exhibit, antisocial, behavior, over, sexualized, behavior, self, harm, aggression, distrust, of, adults, dissociative, disorders, substance, abuse, complex, trauma, and, attention, deficit, disorders, stockholm, syndrome, is, also, a, common, problem, for, trafficked, girls, which, can, hinder, them, from, both, trying, to, escape, and, moving, forward, in, psychological, recovery, programs, although, 98, of, the, sex, trade, is, composed, of, women, and, girls, there, is, an, effort, to, gather, empirical, evidence, about, the, psychological, impact, of, abuse, common, in, sex, trafficking, upon, young, boys, boys, often, will, experience, forms, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, but, also, additional, stressors, of, social, stigma, of, homosexuality, associated, with, sexual, abuse, for, boys, and, externalization, of, blame, increased, anger, and, desire, for, revenge, sex, trafficking, increases, the, risk, of, contracting, hiv, aids, the, hiv, aids, pandemic, can, be, both, a, cause, and, a, consequence, of, sex, trafficking, on, one, hand, children, are, sought, by, customers, because, they, are, perceived, as, being, less, likely, to, be, hiv, positive, and, this, demand, leads, to, child, sex, trafficking, on, the, other, hand, trafficking, leads, to, the, proliferation, of, hiv, because, victims, often, cannot, protect, themselves, properly, and, get, infected, organised, criminal, groups, invest, in, a, wide, range, of, legitimate, businesses, to, conceal, and, launder, the, profits, earned, from, human, trafficking, fair, competition, may, be, undermined, when, human, trafficking, victims, are, exploited, for, cheap, labour, driving, down, production, costs, thereby, indirectly, causing, a, negative, economic, imbalance, this, can, also, depress, wages, for, legal, labourers, according, to, the, united, nations, human, trafficking, can, be, closely, integrated, into, legal, businesses, including, the, tourism, industry, agriculture, hotel, and, airline, operations, and, leisure, and, entertainment, businesses, related, crimes, associated, with, human, trafficking, reportedly, include, fraud, extortion, racketeering, money, laundering, bribery, drug, trafficking, arms, trafficking, car, theft, migrant, smuggling, kidnapping,

trafficking, initiative, that, works, with, the, u, s, department, of, homeland, security, to, combat, human, trafficking, and, bring, freedom, to, exploited, victims, however, critical, commentators,

the, u, s, state, department, s, 2018, trafficking, in, persons, report, singapore, is, making, significant, efforts, to, eliminate, human, trafficking, as, it, imposes, strong, sentences, against, convicted, traffickers, improve, freedom, of, movement, for, adult, victims, and, increases, migrant, workers, awareness, of, their, rights, however, it, still, does, not, meet, the, minimum, standards, as, numerous, migrant, workers, work, conditions, indicate, labor, trafficking, but, conviction, is, not, secured, both, the, public, debate, on, human, trafficking, and, the, actions, undertaken, by, the, anti, human, traffickers, have, been, criticized, by, numerous, scholars, and, experts, including, zbigniew, dumienski, a, former, research, analyst, at, the, s, rajaratnam, school, of, international, studies, the, criticism, touches, upon, statistics, and, data, on, human, trafficking, the, concept, itself, and, anti, trafficking, measures, according, to, a, former, wall, street, journal, columnist, figures, used, in, human, trafficking, estimates, rarely, have, identifiable, sources, or, transparent, methodologies, behind, them, and, in, most, if, not, all, instances, they, are, mere, guesses, dumienski, and, laura, agustin, argue, that, this, is, a, result, of, the, fact, that, it, is, impossible, to, produce, reliable, statistics, on, a, phenomenon, happening, in, the, shadow, economy, according, to, a, unesco, bangkok, researcher, statistics, on, human, trafficking, may, be, unreliable, due, to, overrepresentation, of, sex, trafficking, as, an, example, he, cites, flaws, in, thai, statistics, which, discount, men, from, their, official, numbers, because, by, law, they, cannot, be, considered, trafficking, victims, due, to, their, gender, a, 2012, article, in, the, international, communication, gazette, examined, the, effect, of, two, communication, theories, agenda, building, and, agenda, setting, on, media, coverage, on, human, trafficking, in, the, united, states, and, britain, the, article, analyzed, four, newspapers, including, the, guardian, and, the, washington, post, and, categorized, the, content, into, various, categories, overall, the, article, found, that, sex, trafficking, was, the, most, reported, form, of, human, trafficking, by, the, newspapers, that, were, analyzed, p, 154, many, of, the, other, stories, on, trafficking, were, non, specific, according, to, zbigniew, dumienski, the, very, concept, of, human, trafficking, is, murky, and, misleading, it, has, been, argued, that, while, human, trafficking, is, commonly, seen, as, a, monolithic, crime, in, reality, it, may, be, an, act, of, illegal, migration, that, involves, various, different, actions, some, of, them, may, be, criminal, or, abusive, but, others, often, involve, consent, and, are, legal, laura, agustin, argues, that, not, everything, that, might, seem, abusive, or, coercive, is, considered, as, such, by, the, migrant, for, instance, she, states, that, would, be, travellers, commonly, seek, help, from, intermediaries, who, sell, information, services, and, documents, when, travellers, cannot, afford, to, buy, these, outright, they, go, into, debt, dumienski, says, that, while, these, debts, might, indeed, be, on, very, harsh, conditions, they, are, usually, incurred, on, a, voluntary, basis, british, scholar, julia, o, connell, davidson, has, advanced, the, same, argument, furthermore, anti, trafficking, actors, often, conflate, clandestine, migratory, movements, or, voluntary, sex, work, with, forms, of, exploitation, covered, in, human, trafficking, definitions, ignoring, the, fact, that, a, migratory, movement, is, not, a, requirement, for, human, trafficking, victimization, the, critics, of, the, current, approaches, to, trafficking, say, that, a, lot, of, the, violence, and, exploitation, faced, by, irregular, migrants, derives, precisely, from, the, fact, that, their, migration, and, their, work, are, illegal, and, not, primarily, because, of, trafficking, the, international, save, the, children, organization, also, stated, the, issue, however, gets, mired, in, controversy, and, confusion, when, prostitution, too, is, considered, as, a, violation, of, the, basic, human, rights, of, both, adult, women, and, minors, and, equal, to, sexual, exploitation, per, se, trafficking, and, prostitution, become, conflated, with, each, other, on, account, of, the, historical, conflation, of, trafficking, and, prostitution, both, legally, and, in, popular, understanding, an, overwhelming, degree, of, effort, and, interventions, of, anti, trafficking, groups, are, concentrated, on, trafficking, into, prostitution, claudia, aradau, of, the, open, university, claims, that, ngos, involved, in, anti, sex, trafficking, often, employ, politics, of, pity, which, promotes, that, all, trafficked, victims, are, completely, guiltless, fully, coerced, into, sex, work, and, experience, the, same, degrees, of, physical, suffering, one, critic, identifies, two, strategies, that, gain, pity, denunciation, attributing, all, violence, and, suffering, to, the, perpetrator, and, sentiment, exclusively, depicting, the, suffering, of, the, women, ngos, use, of, images, of, unidentifiable, women, suffering, physically, help, display, sex, trafficking, scenarios, as, all, the, same, she, points, out, that, not, all, trafficking, victims, have, been, abducted, abused, physically, and, repeatedly, raped, unlike, popular, portrayals, a, study, of, the, relationships, between, individuals, who, are, defined, as, sex, trafficking, victims, by, virtue, of, having, a, procurer, especially, minors, concluded, that, assumptions, about, victimization, and, human, trafficking, do, not, do, justice, to, the, complex, and, often, mutual, relationships, that, exist, between, sex, workers, and, their, third, parties, another, common, critique, is, that, the, concept, of, human, trafficking, focuses, only, on, the, most, extreme, forms, of, exploitation, and, diverts, attention, and, resources, away, from, more, everyday, but, arguably, much, more, widespread, forms, of, exploitation, and, abuse, that, occur, as, part, of, the, normal, functioning, of, the, economy, as, quirk, robinson, and, thibos, write, it, is, not, always, possible, to, sharply, separate, human, trafficking, from, everyday, abuses, and, problems, arise, when, the, former, is, singled, out, while, the, latter, is, pushed, to, the, margins, o, connell, davidson, too, argues, that, the, lines, between, the, crimes, of, human, trafficking, modern, slavery, and, the, legally, sanctioned, exploitation, of, migrants, such, as, lower, wages, or, restrictions, on, freedom, of, movement, and, employment, is, blurry, groups, like, amnesty, international, have, been, critical, of, insufficient, or, ineffective, government, measures, to, tackle, human, trafficking, criticism, includes, a, lack, of, understanding, of, human, trafficking, issues, poor, identification, of, victims, and, a, lack, of, resources, for, the, key, pillars, of, anti, trafficking, identification, protection, prosecution, and, prevention, for, example, amnesty, international, has, called, the, uk, government, s, new, anti, trafficking, measures, not, fit, for, purpose, rights, groups, have, called, attention, to, the, negative, impact, that, the, implementation, of, anti, trafficking, measures, have, on, the, human, rights, of, various, groups, especially, migrants, sex, workers, and, trafficked, persons, themselves, the, global, alliance, against, traffic, in, women, drew, attention, to, this, collateral, damage, in, 2007, these, negative, impacts, include, various, restrictions, on, women, s, right, to, migrate, and, undertake, certain, jobs, suspicion, and, harassment, at, international, borders, of, women, travelling, alone, raids, at, sex, work, venues, and, detention, fines, and, harassment, of, sex, workers, see, below, section, on, the, use, of, raids, assistance, to, trafficked, persons, made, conditional, on, their, cooperation, with, law, enforcement, and, forced, confinement, of, trafficked, persons, in, shelters, and, many, more, in, the, uk, human, trafficking, cases, are, processed, by, the, same, officials, to, simultaneously, determine, the, refugee, and, trafficking, victim, statuses, of, a, person, however, criteria, for, qualifying, as, a, refugee, and, a, trafficking, victim, differ, and, they, have, different, needs, for, staying, in, a, country, a, person, may, need, assistance, as, a, trafficking, victim, but, their, circumstances, may, not, necessarily, meet, the, threshold, for, asylum, in, this, case, not, being, granted, refugee, status, affects, their, status, as, a, trafficked, victim, and, thus, their, ability, to, receive, help, reviews, of, the, statistics, from, the, national, referral, mechanism, nrm, a, tool, created, by, the, council, of, europe, convention, on, action, against, trafficking, in, human, beings, coe, convention, to, help, states, effectively, identify, and, care, for, trafficking, victims, found, that, positive, decisions, for, non, european, union, citizens, were, much, lower, than, that, of, eu, and, uk, citizens, according, to, data, on, the, nrm, decisions, from, april, 2009, to, april, 2011, an, average, of, 82, 8, of, uk, and, eu, citizens, were, conclusively, accepted, as, victims, while, an, average, of, only, 45, 9, of, non, eu, citizens, were, granted, the, same, status, high, refusal, rates, of, non, eu, people, point, to, possible, stereotypes, and, biases, about, regions, and, countries, of, origin, which, may, hinder, anti, trafficking, efforts, since, the, asylum, system, is, linked, to, the, trafficking, victim, protection, system, laura, agustin, has, suggested, that, in, some, cases, anti, traffickers, ascribe, victim, status, to, immigrants, who, have, made, conscious, and, rational, decisions, to, cross, the, borders, knowing, they, will, be, selling, sex, and, who, do, not, consider, themselves, to, be, victims, there, have, been, instances, in, which, the, alleged, victims, of, trafficking, have, actually, refused, to, be, rescued, or, run, away, from, the, anti, trafficking, shelters, in, a, 2013, lawsuit, the, court, of, appeal, gave, guidance, to, prosecuting, authorities, on, the, prosecution, of, victims, of, human, trafficking, and, held, that, the, convictions, of, three, vietnamese, children, and, one, ugandan, woman, ought, to, be, quashed, as, the, proceedings, amounted, to, an, abuse, of, the, court, s, process, the, case, was, reported, by, the, bbc, and, one, of, the, victims, was, interviewed, by, channel, 4, in, 2021, the, european, court, of, human, rights, ordered, the, british, government, to, compensate, two, victims, of, child, trafficking, for, their, later, arrest, and, conviction, of, drug, crimes, in, the, u, s, services, and, protections, for, trafficked, victims, are, related, to, cooperation, with, law, enforcement, legal, procedures, that, involve, prosecution, and, specifically, raids, are, thus, the, most, common, anti, trafficking, measures, raids, are, conducted, by, law, enforcement, and, by, private, actors, and, many, organizations, sometimes, in, cooperation, with, law, enforcement, law, enforcement, perceive, some, benefits, from, raids, including, the, ability, to, locate, and, identify, witnesses, for, legal, processes, to, dismantle, criminal, networks, and, to, rescue, victims, from, abuse, the, problems, against, anti, trafficking, raids, are, related, to, the, problem, of, the, trafficking, concept, itself, as, raids, purpose, of, fighting, sex, trafficking, may, be, conflated, with, fighting, prostitution, the, trafficking, victims, protection, re, authorization, act, of, 2005, tvpra, gives, state, and, local, law, enforcement, funding, to, prosecute, customers, of, commercial, sex, therefore, some, law, enforcement, agencies, make, no, distinction, between, prostitution, and, sex, trafficking, one, study, interviewed, women, who, have, experienced, law, enforcement, operations, as, sex, workers, and, found, that, during, these, raids, meant, to, combat, human, trafficking, none, of, the, women, were, ever, identified, as, trafficking, victims, and, only, one, woman, was, asked, whether, she, was, coerced, into, sex, work, the, conflation, of, trafficking, with, prostitution, then, does, not, serve, to, adequately, identify, trafficking, and, help, the, victims, raids, are, also, problematic, in, that, the, women, involved, were, most, likely, unclear, about, who, was, conducting, the, raid, what, the, purpose, of, the, raid, was, and, what, the, outcomes, of, the, raid, would, be, another, study, found, that, the, majority, of, women, rescued, in, anti, trafficking, raids, both, voluntary, and, coerced, sex, workers, eventually, returned, to, sex, work, but, had, amassed, huge, amounts, of, debt, for, legal, fees, and, other, costs, while, they, were, in, detention, after, the, raid, and, were, overall, in, a, worse, situation, than, before, the, raid, law, enforcement, personnel, agree, that, raids, can, intimidate, trafficked, persons, and, render, subsequent, law, enforcement, actions, unsuccessful, social, workers, and, attorneys, involved, in, anti, sex, trafficking, have, negative, opinions, about, raids, service, providers, report, a, lack, of, uniform, procedure, for, identifying, trafficking, victims, after, raids, the, 26, interviewed, service, providers, stated, that, local, police, never, referred, trafficked, persons, to, them, after, raids, law, enforcement, also, often, use, interrogation, methods, that, intimidate, rather, than, assist, potential, trafficking, victims, additionally, sex, workers, sometimes, face, violence, from, the, police, during, raids, and, arrests, and, in, rehabilitation, centers, as, raids, occur, to, brothels, that, may, house, sex, workers, as, well, as, sex, trafficked, victims, raids, affect, sex, workers, in, general, as, clients, avoid, brothel, areas, that, are, raided, but, do, not, stop, paying, for, sex, voluntary, sex, workers, will, have, to, interact, with, customers, underground, underground, interactions, means, that, sex, workers, take, greater, risks, where, as, otherwise, they, would, be, cooperating, with, other, sex, workers, and, with, sex, worker, organizations, to, report, violence, and, protect, each, other, one, example, of, this, is, with, hiv, prevention, sex, workers, collectives, monitor, condom, use, promote, hiv, testing, and, cares, for, and, monitor, the, health, of, hiv, positive, sex, workers, raids, disrupt, communal, hiv, care, and, prevention, efforts, and, if, hiv, positive, sex, workers, are, rescued, and, removed, from, their, community, their, treatments, are, disrupted, furthering, the, spread, of, aids, scholars, aziza, ahmed, and, meena, seshu, suggest, reforms, in, law, enforcement, procedures, so, that, raids, are, last, resort, not, violent, and, are, transparent, in, its, purposes, and, processes, furthermore, they, suggest, that, since, any, trafficking, victims, will, probably, be, in, contact, with, other, sex, workers, first, working, with, sex, workers, may, be, an, alternative, to, the, raid, and, rescue, model, critics, argue, that, end, demand, programs, are, ineffective, in, that, prostitution, is, not, reduced, john, schools, have, little, effect, on, deterrence, and, portray, prostitutes, negatively, and, conflicts, in, interest, arise, between, law, enforcement, and, ngo, service, providers, a, study, found, that, sweden, s, legal, experiment, criminalizing, clients, of, prostitution, and, providing, services, to, prostitutes, who, want, to, exit, the, industry, in, order, to, combat, trafficking, did, not, reduce, the, number, of, prostitutes, but, instead, increased, exploitation, of, sex, workers, because, of, the, higher, risk, nature, of, their, work, the, same, study, reported, that, johns, inclination, to, buy, sex, did, not, change, as, a, result, of, john, schools, and, the, programs, targeted, johns, who, are, poor, and, colored, immigrants, some, john, schools, also, intimidate, johns, into, not, purchasing, sex, again, by, depicting, prostitutes, as, drug, addicts, hiv, positive, violent, and, dangerous, which, further, marginalizes, sex, workers, john, schools, require, program, fees, and, police, involvement, in, ngos, who, provide, these, programs, create, conflicts, of, interest, especially, with, money, involved, however, according, to, a, 2008, study, the, swedish, approach, of, criminalizing, demand, has, led, to, an, equality, centered, approach, that, has, drawn, numerous, positive, reviews, worldwide, there, are, different, feminist, perspectives, on, sex, trafficking, the, third, wave, feminist, perspective, of, sex, trafficking, seeks, to, harmonize, the, dominant, and, liberal, feminist, views, of, sex, trafficking, the, dominant, feminist, view, focuses, on, sexualized, domination, which, includes, issues, of, pornography, female, sex, labor, in, a, patriarchal, world, rape, and, sexual, harassment, dominant, feminism, emphasizes, sex, trafficking, as, forced, prostitution, and, considers, the, act, exploitative, liberal, feminism, sees, all, agents, as, capable, of, reason, and, choice, liberal, feminists, support, sex, workers, rights, and, argue, that, women, who, voluntarily, chose, sex, work, are, autonomous, the, liberal, feminist, perspective, finds, sex, trafficking, problematic, where, it, overrides, consent, of, individuals, third, wave, feminism, harmonizes, the, thoughts, that, while, individuals, have, rights, overarching, inequalities, hinder, women, s, capabilities, third, wave, feminism, also, considers, that, women, who, are, trafficked, and, face, oppression, do, not, all, face, the, same, kinds, of, oppression, for, example, third, wave, feminist, proponent, shelley, cavalieri, identifies, oppression, and, privilege, in, the, intersections, of, race, class, and, gender, women, from, low, socioeconomic, class, generally, from, the, global, south, face, inequalities, that, differ, from, those, of, other, sex, trafficking, victims, therefore, it, advocates, for, catering, to, individual, trafficking, victim, because, sex, trafficking, is, not, monolithic, and, therefore, there, is, not, a, one, size, fits, all, intervention, this, also, means, allowing, individual, victims, to, tell, their, unique, experiences, rather, than, essentializing, all, trafficking, experiences, lastly, third, wave, feminism, promotes, increasing, women, s, agency, both, generally, and, individually, so, that, they, have, the, opportunity, to, act, on, their, own, behalf, third, wave, feminist, perspective, of, sex, trafficking, is, loosely, related, to, amartya, sen, s, and, martha, nussbaum, s, visions, of, the, human, capabilities, approach, to, development, it, advocates, for, creating, viable, alternatives, for, sex, trafficking, victims, nussbaum, articulated, four, concepts, to, increase, trafficking, victims, capabilities, education, for, victims, and, their, children, microcredit, and, increased, employment, options, labor, unions, for, low, income, women, in, general, and, social, groups, that, connect, women, to, one, another, the, clash, between, the, different, feminist, perspectives, on, trafficking, and, sex, work, was, especially, evident, at, the, negotiations, of, the, palermo, protocol, one, feminist, group, led, by, the, global, alliance, against, traffic, in, women, saw, trafficking, as, the, result, of, globalisation, and, restrictive, labour, migration, policies, with, force, fraud, and, coercion, as, its, defining, features, the, other, feminist, group, led, by, the, coalition, against, trafficking, in, women, saw, trafficking, more, narrowly, as, the, result, of, men, s, demand, for, paid, sex, both, groups, tried, to, influence, the, definition, of, trafficking, and, other, provisions, in, the, protocol, eventually, both, were, only, partially, successful, however, scholars, have, noted, that, this, rift, between, feminist, organisations, led, to, the, extremely, weak, and, voluntary, victim, protection, provisions, of, the, protocol, according, to, modern, feminists, women, and, girls, are, more, prone, to, trafficking, also, because, of, social, norms, that, marginalize, their, value, and, status, in, society, by, this, perspective, females, face, considerable, gender, discrimination, both, at, home, and, in, school, stereotypes, that, women, belong, at, home, in, the, private, sphere, and, that, women, are, less, valuable, because, they, do, not, and, are, not, allowed, to, contribute, to, formal, employment, and, monetary, gains, the, same, way, men, do, further, marginalize, women, s, status, relative, to, men, some, religious, beliefs, also, lead, people, to, believe, that, the, birth, of, girls, are, a, result, of, bad, karma, further, cementing, the, belief, that, girls, are, not, as, valuable, as, boys, it, is, generally, regarded, by, feminists, that, various, social, norms, contribute, to, women, s, inferior, position, and, lack, of, agency, and, knowledge, thus, making, them, vulnerable, to, exploitation, such, as, sex, trafficking
