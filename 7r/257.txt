the, slavs, or, slavic, people, are, groups, of, people, who, speak, slavic, languages, slavs, are, geographically, distributed, throughout, the, northern, parts, of, eurasia, they, predominantly, inhabit, central, europe, eastern, europe, and, southeastern, europe, and, northern, asia, though, there, is, a, large, slavic, minority, scattered, across, the, baltic, states, and, central, asia, and, a, substantial, slavic, diaspora, in, the, americas, western, europe, and, northern, europe, early, slavs, lived, during, the, migration, period, and, the, early, middle, ages, approximately, from, the, 5th, to, the, 10th, century, ad, and, came, to, control, large, parts, of, central, eastern, and, southeast, europe, between, the, sixth, and, seventh, centuries, beginning, in, the, 7th, century, they, were, gradually, christianized, by, the, 12th, century, they, formed, the, core, population, of, a, number, of, medieval, christian, states, east, slavs, in, the, kievan, rus, south, slavs, in, the, bulgarian, empire, the, principality, of, serbia, the, duchy, of, croatia, and, the, banate, of, bosnia, and, west, slavs, in, the, principality, of, nitra, great, moravia, the, duchy, of, bohemia, and, the, kingdom, of, poland, beginning, in, the, mid, 19th, century, a, pan, slavic, movement, has, emphasized, the, common, heritage, and, unity, of, all, the, slavic, peoples, the, main, focus, of, the, movement, was, in, the, balkans, whereas, the, russian, empire, was, opposed, to, it, the, slavic, languages, belong, to, the, balto, slavic, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, present, day, slavs, are, classified, into, three, groups, though, the, majority, of, slavs, are, christians, some, groups, such, as, the, bosniaks, mostly, identify, as, muslims, modern, slavic, nations, and, ethnic, groups, are, considerably, diverse, both, genetically, and, culturally, and, relations, between, them, may, range, from, ethnic, solidarity, to, mutual, feelings, of, hostility, even, within, the, individual, groups, the, oldest, mention, of, the, slavic, ethnonym, is, from, the, 6th, century, ad, when, procopius, writing, in, byzantine, greek, used, various, forms, such, as, sklaboi, sklab, noi, sklauenoi, sthlabenoi, or, sklabinoi, and, his, contemporary, jordanes, refers, to, the, sclaveni, in, latin, the, oldest, documents, written, in, old, church, slavonic, dating, from, the, 9th, century, attest, the, autonym, as, slov, ne, those, forms, point, back, to, a, slavic, autonym, which, can, be, reconstructed, in, proto, slavic, as, slov, nin, plural, slov, ne, the, reconstructed, autonym, slov, nin, is, usually, considered, a, derivation, from, slovo, word, originally, denoting, people, who, speak, the, same, language, meaning, people, who, understand, one, another, in, contrast, to, the, slavic, word, denoting, german, people, namely, n, m, c, meaning, silent, mute, people, from, slavic, n, m, mute, mumbling, the, word, slovo, word, and, the, related, slava, glory, fame, and, sluh, hearing, originate, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, lew, be, spoken, of, glory, cognate, with, ancient, greek, kl, os, fame, as, in, the, name, pericles, latin, clue, be, called, and, english, loud, in, medieval, and, early, modern, sources, written, in, latin, slavs, are, most, commonly, referred, to, as, sclaveni, or, the, shortened, version, sclavi, ancient, roman, sources, refer, to, the, early, slavic, peoples, as, veneti, who, dwelt, in, a, region, of, central, europe, east, of, the, germanic, tribe, of, suebi, and, west, of, the, iranian, sarmatians, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, centuries, ad, between, the, upper, vistula, and, dnieper, rivers, slavs, called, antes, and, sclaveni, first, appear, in, byzantine, records, in, the, early, 6th, century, ad, byzantine, historiographers, of, the, era, of, the, emperor, justinian, i, r, 527, 565, such, as, procopius, of, caesarea, jordanes, and, theophylact, simocatta, describe, tribes, of, these, names, emerging, from, the, area, of, the, carpathian, mountains, the, lower, danube, and, the, black, sea, to, invade, the, danubian, provinces, of, the, eastern, empire, jordanes, in, his, work, getica, written, in, 551, ad, describes, the, veneti, as, a, populous, nation, whose, dwellings, begin, at, the, sources, of, the, vistula, and, occupy, a, great, expanse, of, land, he, also, describes, the, veneti, as, the, ancestors, of, antes, and, slaveni, two, early, slavic, tribes, who, appeared, on, the, byzantine, frontier, in, the, early, 6th, century, procopius, wrote, in, 545, that, the, sclaveni, and, the, antae, actually, had, a, single, name, in, the, remote, past, for, they, were, both, called, sporoi, in, olden, times, the, name, sporoi, derives, from, greek, to, sow, he, described, them, as, barbarians, who, lived, under, democracy, and, believed, in, one, god, the, maker, of, lightning, perun, to, whom, they, made, sacrifice, they, lived, in, scattered, housing, and, constantly, changed, settlement, in, war, they, were, mainly, foot, soldiers, with, shields, spears, bows, and, little, armour, which, was, reserved, mainly, for, chiefs, and, their, inner, circle, of, warriors, their, language, is, barbarous, that, is, not, greek, and, the, two, tribes, are, alike, in, appearance, being, tall, and, robust, while, their, bodies, and, hair, are, neither, very, fair, or, blond, nor, indeed, do, they, incline, entirely, to, the, dark, type, but, they, are, all, slightly, ruddy, in, color, and, they, live, a, hard, life, giving, no, heed, to, bodily, comforts, jordanes, describes, the, sclaveni, as, having, swamps, and, forests, for, their, cities, another, 6th, century, source, refers, to, them, living, among, nearly, impenetrable, forests, rivers, lakes, and, marshes, menander, protector, mentions, daurentius, r, c, 577, 579, who, slew, an, avar, envoy, of, khagan, bayan, i, for, asking, the, slavs, to, accept, the, suzerainty, of, the, avars, daurentius, declined, and, is, reported, as, saying, others, do, not, conquer, our, land, we, conquer, theirs, so, it, shall, always, be, for, us, as, long, as, there, are, wars, and, weapons, according, to, eastern, homeland, theory, prior, to, becoming, known, to, the, roman, world, slavic, speaking, tribes, formed, part, of, several, successive, multi, ethnic, confederacies, of, eurasia, such, as, the, sarmatian, hun, and, gothic, empires, the, slavs, emerged, from, obscurity, when, the, westward, movement, of, germanic, tribes, in, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, ad, thought, to, be, in, conjunction, with, the, movement, of, peoples, from, siberia, and, eastern, europe, huns, and, later, avars, and, bulgars, started, the, great, migration, of, the, slavs, who, settled, the, lands, abandoned, by, germanic, tribes, who, had, fled, from, the, huns, and, their, allies, slavs, according, to, this, account, moved, westward, into, the, country, between, the, oder, and, the, elbe, saale, line, southward, into, bohemia, moravia, much, of, present, day, austria, the, pannonian, plain, and, the, balkans, and, northward, along, the, upper, dnieper, river, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, some, slavs, migrated, with, the, vandals, to, the, iberian, peninsula, and, even, to, north, africa, on, the, other, hand, historian, florin, curta, categorically, dismisses, the, concept, of, slavs, migration, and, opts, instead, for, short, distance, population, movements, that, would, explain, the, spread, of, slavic, languages, he, argues, in, favor, of, this, view, that, the, proposed, migration, models, are, inconsistent, with, the, archaeological, findings, for, example, the, prague, type, pottery, associated, with, slavs, was, not, found, anywhere, south, of, the, danube, where, large, numbers, of, slavic, speaking, people, emerged, in, the, early, middle, ages, around, the, 6th, century, slavs, appeared, on, byzantine, borders, in, large, numbers, byzantine, records, note, that, slav, numbers, were, so, great, that, grass, would, not, regrow, where, the, slavs, had, marched, through, military, movements, resulted, in, even, the, peloponnese, and, asia, minor, being, reported, to, have, slavic, settlements, this, southern, movement, has, traditionally, been, seen, as, an, invasive, expansion, by, the, end, of, the, 6th, century, slavs, had, settled, the, eastern, alps, regions, pope, gregory, i, in, 600, ad, wrote, to, maximus, the, bishop, of, salona, in, dalmatia, expressing, concern, about, the, arrival, of, the, slavs, latin, et, quidem, de, sclavorum, gente, quae, vobis, valde, imminet, et, affligor, vehementer, et, conturbor, affligor, in, his, quae, jam, in, vobis, patior, conturbor, quia, per, istriae, aditum, jam, ad, italiam, intrare, coeperunt, english, i, am, both, distressed, and, disturbed, about, the, slavs, who, are, pressing, hard, on, you, i, am, distressed, because, i, sympathize, with, you, i, am, disturbed, because, they, have, already, begun, to, arrive, in, italy, through, the, entry, point, of, istria, when, slav, migrations, ended, their, first, state, organizations, appeared, each, headed, by, a, prince, with, a, treasury, and, a, defense, force, in, the, 7th, century, the, frankish, merchant, samo, supported, the, slavs, against, their, avar, rulers, and, became, the, ruler, of, the, first, known, slav, state, in, central, europe, samo, s, empire, this, early, slavic, polity, probably, did, not, outlive, its, founder, and, ruler, but, it, was, the, foundation, for, later, west, slavic, states, on, its, territory, the, oldest, of, them, was, carantania, others, are, the, principality, of, nitra, the, moravian, principality, see, under, great, moravia, and, the, balaton, principality, the, first, bulgarian, empire, was, founded, in, 681, as, an, alliance, between, the, ruling, bulgars, and, the, numerous, slavs, in, the, area, and, their, south, slavic, language, the, old, church, slavonic, became, the, main, and, official, language, of, the, empire, in, 864, ad, bulgaria, was, instrumental, in, the, spread, of, slavic, literacy, and, christianity, to, the, rest, of, the, slavic, world, duchy, of, croatia, was, founded, in, 7th, century, and, later, became, kingdom, of, croatia, principality, of, serbia, was, founded, in, 8th, duchy, of, bohemia, and, kievan, rus, both, in, the, 9th, century, the, expansion, of, the, magyars, into, the, carpathian, basin, and, the, germanization, of, austria, gradually, separated, the, south, slavs, from, the, west, and, east, slavs, later, slavic, states, which, formed, in, the, following, centuries, included, the, second, bulgarian, empire, the, kingdom, of, poland, banate, of, bosnia, duklja, and, kingdom, of, serbia, which, later, grew, into, serbian, empire, pan, slavism, a, movement, which, came, into, prominence, in, the, mid, 19th, century, emphasized, the, common, heritage, and, unity, of, all, the, slavic, peoples, the, main, focus, was, in, the, balkans, where, the, south, slavs, had, been, ruled, for, centuries, by, other, empires, the, byzantine, empire, austria, hungary, the, ottoman, empire, and, venice, austro, hungary, envisioned, its, own, political, concept, of, austro, slavism, in, opposition, of, pan, slavism, that, was, predominantly, led, by, the, russian, empire, as, of, 1878, there, were, only, three, majority, slavic, states, in, the, world, the, russian, empire, principality, of, serbia, and, principality, of, montenegro, bulgaria, was, effectively, independent, but, was, de, jure, vassal, to, the, ottoman, empire, until, official, independence, was, declared, in, 1908, the, slavic, peoples, who, were, for, the, most, part, denied, a, voice, in, the, affairs, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, were, calling, for, national, self, determination, during, world, war, i, representatives, of, the, czechs, slovaks, poles, serbs, croats, and, slovenes, set, up, organizations, in, the, allied, countries, to, gain, sympathy, and, recognition, in, 1918, after, world, war, i, ended, the, slavs, established, such, independent, states, as, czechoslovakia, the, second, polish, republic, and, the, kingdom, of, serbs, croats, and, slovenes, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, russia, and, the, soviet, union, was, marked, by, a, succession, of, wars, famines, and, other, disasters, each, accompanied, by, large, scale, population, losses, the, two, major, famines, were, in, 1921, to, 1923, and, 1932, to, 1933, which, caused, millions, of, deaths, mostly, around, ukraine, and, the, northern, caucasus, the, latter, resulted, from, soviet, leader, joseph, stalin, s, collectivization, of, agriculture, in, ukraine, during, the, war, nazi, germany, used, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, for, slave, labor, in, their, concentration, camps, the, majority, of, whom, were, jewish, or, slavic, both, groups, were, a, part, of, what, germans, claimed, to, be, a, vast, racially, subhuman, surplus, population, that, they, intended, to, eliminate, in, time, from, their, new, empire, their, term, for, racial, subhumans, being, untermensch, thus, one, of, adolf, hitler, s, ambitions, at, the, start, of, world, war, ii, was, to, exterminate, expel, or, enslave, most, or, all, west, and, east, slavs, from, their, native, lands, so, as, to, make, living, space, for, german, settlers, in, early, 1941, germany, began, planning, generalplan, ost, the, genocide, of, slavs, in, eastern, europe, which, was, supposed, to, start, after, a, major, expansion, of, german, concentration, camps, in, occupied, poland, and, the, fall, of, stalin, s, regime, this, plan, was, to, be, carried, out, gradually, over, 25, to, 30, years, after, an, approximate, 30, million, slavs, would, be, killed, through, starvation, and, their, major, cities, depopulated, the, germans, were, supposed, to, repopulate, eastern, europe, in, june, 1941, when, germany, invaded, the, soviet, union, in, operation, barbarossa, hitler, paused, the, plan, to, focus, on, the, extermination, of, the, jews, however, some, of, the, plan, was, nonetheless, implemented, millions, of, slavs, were, murdered, in, eastern, europe, this, includes, victims, of, the, hunger, plan, germany, s, intentional, starvation, of, the, region, as, well, as, the, murders, of, 3, 3, million, soviet, prisoners, of, war, germany, s, heinrich, himmler, also, ordered, his, subordinate, ludolf, hermann, von, alvensleben, to, start, repopulating, crimea, and, hundreds, of, ethnic, germans, were, forcibly, moved, to, cities, and, villages, there, the, soviet, red, army, took, back, their, land, from, the, germans, in, 1944, stephen, j, lee, estimates, that, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, the, russian, population, was, about, 90, million, fewer, than, it, could, have, been, otherwise, also, during, world, war, ii, fascist, italy, sent, tens, of, thousands, of, slavs, to, concentration, camps, in, mainland, italy, libya, and, the, balkans, because, italian, leader, benito, mussolini, also, had, a, hatred, of, them, in, 1991, the, soviet, union, collapsed, and, many, former, soviet, republics, became, independent, countries, currently, former, soviet, states, in, central, asia, such, as, kazakhstan, and, kyrgyzstan, have, very, large, minority, slavic, populations, with, most, being, russians, kazakhstan, has, the, largest, slavic, minority, population, proto, slavic, the, supposed, ancestor, language, of, all, slavic, languages, is, a, descendant, of, common, proto, indo, european, via, a, balto, slavic, stage, in, which, it, developed, numerous, lexical, and, morphophonological, isoglosses, with, the, baltic, languages, in, the, framework, of, the, kurgan, hypothesis, the, indo, europeans, who, remained, after, the, migrations, became, speakers, of, balto, slavic, proto, slavic, is, defined, as, the, last, stage, of, the, language, preceding, the, geographical, split, of, the, historical, slavic, languages, that, language, was, uniform, and, on, the, basis, of, borrowings, from, foreign, languages, and, slavic, borrowings, into, other, languages, it, cannot, be, said, to, have, any, recognizable, dialects, which, suggests, that, there, was, at, one, time, a, relatively, small, proto, slavic, homeland, slavic, linguistic, unity, was, to, some, extent, visible, as, late, as, old, church, slavonic, or, old, bulgarian, manuscripts, which, though, based, on, local, slavic, speech, of, thessaloniki, could, still, serve, the, purpose, of, the, first, common, slavic, literary, language, standardised, slavic, languages, that, have, official, status, in, at, least, one, country, are, belarusian, bosnian, bulgarian, croatian, czech, macedonian, montenegrin, polish, russian, serbian, slovak, slovene, and, ukrainian, russian, is, the, most, spoken, slavic, language, and, is, the, most, spoken, native, language, in, europe, the, alphabets, used, for, slavic, languages, are, usually, connected, to, the, dominant, religion, among, the, respective, ethnic, groups, orthodox, christians, use, the, cyrillic, alphabet, while, catholics, use, the, latin, alphabet, the, bosniaks, who, are, muslim, also, use, the, latin, alphabet, and, cyrillic, alphabet, in, serbia, additionally, some, eastern, catholics, and, western, catholics, use, the, cyrillic, alphabet, serbian, and, montenegrin, use, both, the, cyrillic, and, latin, alphabets, there, is, also, a, latin, script, to, write, in, belarusian, called, acinka, and, in, ukrainian, called, latynka, west, slavs, originate, from, early, slavic, tribes, which, settled, in, central, europe, after, the, east, germanic, tribes, had, left, this, area, during, the, migration, period, they, are, noted, as, having, mixed, with, germanics, hungarians, celts, particularly, the, boii, old, prussians, and, the, pannonian, avars, the, west, slavs, came, under, the, influence, of, the, western, roman, empire, latin, and, of, the, catholic, church, east, slavs, have, origins, in, early, slavic, tribes, who, mixed, and, contacted, with, finns, balts, and, with, the, remnants, of, the, people, of, the, goths, their, early, slavic, component, antes, mixed, or, absorbed, iranians, and, later, received, influence, from, the, khazars, and, vikings, the, east, slavs, trace, their, national, origins, to, the, tribal, unions, of, kievan, rus, and, rus, khaganate, beginning, in, the, 10th, century, they, came, particularly, under, the, influence, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, south, slavs, from, most, of, the, region, have, origins, in, early, slavic, tribes, who, mixed, with, the, local, proto, balkanic, tribes, illyrian, dacian, thracian, paeonian, hellenic, tribes, and, celtic, tribes, particularly, the, scordisci, as, well, as, with, romans, and, the, romanized, remnants, of, the, former, groups, and, also, with, remnants, of, temporarily, settled, invading, east, germanic, asiatic, or, caucasian, tribes, such, as, gepids, huns, avars, goths, and, bulgars, the, original, inhabitants, of, present, day, slovenia, and, continental, croatia, have, origins, in, early, slavic, tribes, who, mixed, with, romans, and, romanized, celtic, and, illyrian, people, as, well, as, with, avars, and, germanic, peoples, lombards, and, east, goths, the, south, slavs, except, the, slovenes, and, croats, came, under, the, cultural, sphere, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, byzantine, empire, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, islam, while, the, slovenes, and, the, croats, were, influenced, by, the, western, roman, empire, latin, and, thus, by, the, catholic, church, in, a, similar, fashion, to, that, of, the, west, slavs, consistent, with, the, proximity, of, their, languages, analyses, of, y, chromosomes, mdna, and, autosomal, marker, ccr5de132, shows, that, east, slavs, and, west, slavs, are, genetically, very, similar, but, demonstrating, significant, differences, from, neighboring, finno, ugric, turkic, and, north, caucasian, peoples, such, genetic, homogeneity, is, somewhat, unusual, given, such, a, wide, dispersal, of, slavic, populations, together, they, form, the, basis, of, the, east, european, gene, cluster, which, also, includes, non, slavic, hungarians, and, aromanians, only, northern, russians, among, east, and, west, slavs, belong, to, a, different, northern, european, genetic, cluster, along, with, balts, germanic, and, baltic, finnic, peoples, northern, russian, populations, are, very, similar, to, balts, the, 2006, y, dna, study, results, suggest, that, the, slavic, expansion, started, from, the, territory, of, present, day, ukraine, thus, supporting, the, hypothesis, placing, the, earliest, known, homeland, of, slavs, in, the, basin, of, the, middle, dnieper, according, to, genetic, studies, until, 2020, the, distribution, variance, and, frequency, of, the, y, dna, haplogroups, r1a, and, i2, and, their, subclades, r, m558, r, m458, and, i, cts10228, among, south, slavs, correlate, with, the, spread, of, slavic, languages, during, the, medieval, slavic, expansion, from, eastern, europe, most, probably, from, the, territory, of, present, day, ukraine, and, southeastern, poland, according, to, a, 2017, study, slavic, speakers, like, russians, ukrainians, and, belarusians, have, similar, genetic, components, ukrainians, and, belarusians, have, near, equal, amounts, of, two, european, components, which, are, commonly, found, in, north, europe, and, caucasus, respectively, there, is, also, no, evidence, of, asian, admixture, however, samples, of, novosibirsk, residents, and, old, believers, in, siberia, have, 5, 10, central, siberian, ancestry, despite, being, genetically, close, to, european, slavs, the, pagan, slavic, populations, were, christianized, between, the, 7th, and, 12th, centuries, orthodox, christianity, is, predominant, among, east, and, south, slavs, while, catholicism, is, predominant, among, west, slavs, and, some, western, south, slavs, the, religious, borders, are, largely, comparable, to, the, east, west, schism, which, began, in, the, 11th, century, islam, first, arrived, in, the, 7th, century, during, the, early, muslim, conquests, and, was, gradually, adopted, by, a, number, of, slavic, ethnic, groups, through, the, centuries, in, the, balkans, among, slavic, populations, who, profess, a, religion, the, majority, of, contemporary, christian, slavs, are, orthodox, followed, by, catholic, the, majority, of, muslim, slavs, follow, the, hanafi, school, of, the, sunni, branch, of, islam, religious, delineations, by, nationality, can, be, very, sharp, usually, in, the, slavic, ethnic, groups, the, vast, majority, of, religious, people, share, the, same, religion, mainly, eastern, orthodoxy, mainly, catholicism, mainly, islam, throughout, their, history, slavs, came, into, contact, with, non, slavic, groups, in, the, postulated, homeland, region, present, day, ukraine, they, had, contacts, with, the, iranian, sarmatians, and, the, germanic, goths, after, their, subsequent, spread, the, slavs, began, assimilating, non, slavic, peoples, for, example, in, the, northern, black, sea, region, the, slavs, assimilated, the, remnants, of, the, goths, in, the, balkans, there, were, paleo, balkan, peoples, such, as, romanized, and, hellenized, jire, ek, line, illyrians, thracians, and, dacians, as, well, as, greeks, and, celtic, scordisci, and, serdi, because, slavs, were, so, numerous, most, indigenous, populations, of, the, balkans, were, slavicized, thracians, and, illyrians, mixed, as, ethnic, groups, in, this, period, a, notable, exception, is, greece, where, slavs, were, hellenized, because, greeks, were, more, numerous, especially, with, more, greeks, returning, to, greece, in, the, 9th, century, and, the, influence, of, the, church, and, administration, however, slavicized, regions, within, macedonia, thrace, and, moesia, inferior, also, had, a, larger, portion, of, locals, compared, to, migrating, slavs, other, notable, exceptions, are, the, territory, of, present, day, romania, and, hungary, where, slavs, settled, en, route, to, present, day, greece, north, macedonia, bulgaria, and, east, thrace, but, assimilated, and, the, modern, albanian, nation, which, claims, descent, from, illyrians, and, other, balkan, tribes, the, status, of, the, bulgars, as, a, ruling, class, and, their, control, of, the, land, nominally, left, their, legacy, in, the, bulgarian, country, and, people, but, bulgars, were, gradually, also, slavicized, into, the, present, day, south, slavic, ethnic, group, known, as, bulgarians, the, romance, speakers, within, the, fortified, dalmatian, cities, retained, their, culture, and, language, for, a, long, time, dalmatian, romance, was, spoken, until, the, high, middle, ages, but, they, too, were, eventually, assimilated, into, the, body,
