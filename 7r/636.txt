an, opinion, poll, often, simply, referred, to, as, a, survey, or, a, poll, although, strictly, a, poll, is, an, actual, election, is, a, human, research, survey, of, public, opinion, from, a, particular, sample, opinion, polls, are, usually, designed, to, represent, the, opinions, of, a, population, by, conducting, a, series, of, questions, and, then, extrapolating, generalities, in, ratio, or, within, confidence, intervals, a, person, who, conducts, polls, is, referred, to, as, a, pollster, the, first, known, example, of, an, opinion, poll, was, a, tally, of, voter, preferences, reported, by, the, raleigh, star, and, north, carolina, state, gazette, and, the, wilmington, american, watchman, and, delaware, advertiser, prior, to, the, 1824, presidential, election, showing, andrew, jackson, leading, john, quincy, adams, by, 335, votes, to, 169, in, the, contest, for, the, united, states, presidency, since, jackson, won, the, popular, vote, in, that, state, and, the, national, popular, vote, such, straw, votes, gradually, became, more, popular, but, they, remained, local, usually, citywide, phenomena, in, 1916, the, literary, digest, embarked, on, a, national, survey, partly, as, a, circulation, raising, exercise, and, correctly, predicted, woodrow, wilson, s, election, as, president, mailing, out, millions, of, postcards, and, simply, counting, the, returns, the, literary, digest, also, correctly, predicted, the, victories, of, warren, harding, in, 1920, calvin, coolidge, in, 1924, herbert, hoover, in, 1928, and, franklin, roosevelt, in, 1932, then, in, 1936, its, survey, of, 2, 3, million, voters, suggested, that, alf, landon, would, win, the, presidential, election, but, roosevelt, was, instead, re, elected, by, a, landslide, george, gallup, s, research, found, that, the, error, was, mainly, caused, by, participation, bias, those, who, favored, landon, were, more, enthusiastic, about, returning, their, postcards, furthermore, the, postcards, were, sent, to, a, target, audience, who, were, more, affluent, than, the, american, population, as, a, whole, and, therefore, more, likely, to, have, republican, sympathies, at, the, same, time, gallup, archibald, crossley, and, elmo, roper, conducted, surveys, that, were, far, smaller, but, more, scientifically, based, and, all, three, managed, to, correctly, predict, the, result, the, literary, digest, soon, went, out, of, business, while, polling, started, to, take, off, roper, went, on, to, correctly, predict, the, two, subsequent, reelections, of, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, louis, harris, had, been, in, the, field, of, public, opinion, since, 1947, when, he, joined, the, elmo, roper, firm, then, later, became, partner, in, september, 1938, jean, stoetzel, after, having, met, gallup, created, ifop, the, institut, fran, ais, d, opinion, publique, as, the, first, european, survey, institute, in, paris, stoetzel, started, political, polls, in, summer, 1939, with, the, question, why, die, for, danzig, looking, for, popular, support, or, dissent, with, this, question, asked, by, appeasement, politician, and, future, collaborationist, marcel, d, at, gallup, launched, a, subsidiary, in, the, united, kingdom, that, was, almost, alone, in, correctly, predicting, labour, s, victory, in, the, 1945, general, election, virtually, all, other, commentators, had, expected, a, victory, for, the, conservative, party, led, by, wartime, leader, winston, churchill, the, allied, occupation, powers, helped, to, create, survey, institutes, in, all, of, the, western, occupation, zones, of, germany, in, 1947, and, 1948, to, better, steer, denazification, by, the, 1950s, various, types, of, polling, had, spread, to, most, democracies, viewed, from, a, long, term, perspective, advertising, had, come, under, heavy, pressure, in, the, early, 1930s, the, great, depression, forced, businesses, to, drastically, cut, back, on, their, advertising, spending, layoffs, and, reductions, were, common, at, all, agencies, the, new, deal, furthermore, aggressively, promoted, consumerism, and, minimized, the, value, of, or, need, for, advertising, historian, jackson, lears, argues, that, by, the, late, 1930s, though, corporate, advertisers, had, begun, a, successful, counterattack, against, their, critics, they, rehabilitated, the, concept, of, consumer, sovereignty, by, inventing, scientific, public, opinion, polls, and, making, it, the, centerpiece, of, their, own, market, research, as, well, as, the, key, to, understanding, politics, george, gallup, the, vice, president, of, young, and, rubicam, and, numerous, other, advertising, experts, led, the, way, moving, into, the, 1940s, the, industry, played, a, leading, role, in, the, ideological, mobilization, of, the, american, people, in, fighting, the, nazis, and, the, japanese, in, world, war, ii, as, part, of, that, effort, they, redefined, the, american, way, of, life, in, terms, of, a, commitment, to, free, enterprise, advertisers, lears, concludes, played, a, crucial, hegemonic, role, in, creating, the, consumer, culture, that, dominated, post, world, war, ii, american, society, opinion, polls, for, many, years, were, maintained, through, telecommunications, or, in, person, to, person, contact, methods, and, techniques, vary, though, they, are, widely, accepted, in, most, areas, over, the, years, technological, innovations, have, also, influenced, survey, methods, such, as, the, availability, of, electronic, clipboards, and, internet, based, polling, verbal, ballot, and, processed, types, can, be, conducted, efficiently, contrasted, with, other, types, of, surveys, systematics, and, complicated, matrices, beyond, previous, orthodox, procedures, opinion, polling, developed, into, popular, applications, through, popular, thought, although, response, rates, for, some, surveys, declined, also, the, following, has, also, led, to, differentiating, results, some, polling, organizations, such, as, angus, reid, public, opinion, yougov, find, out, now, and, zogby, use, internet, surveys, where, a, sample, is, drawn, from, a, large, panel, of, volunteers, and, the, results, are, weighted, to, reflect, the, demographics, of, the, population, of, interest, in, contrast, popular, web, polls, draw, on, whoever, wishes, to, participate, rather, than, a, scientific, sample, of, the, population, and, are, therefore, not, generally, considered, professional, recently, statistical, learning, methods, have, been, proposed, in, order, to, exploit, social, media, content, such, as, posts, on, the, micro, blogging, platform, twitter, for, modelling, and, predicting, voting, intention, polls, polls, can, be, used, in, the, public, relations, field, as, well, in, the, early, 1920s, public, relation, experts, described, their, work, as, a, two, way, street, their, job, would, be, to, present, the, misinterpreted, interests, of, large, institutions, to, public, they, would, also, gauge, the, typically, ignored, interests, of, the, public, through, polls, a, benchmark, poll, is, generally, the, first, poll, taken, in, a, campaign, it, is, often, taken, before, a, candidate, announces, their, bid, for, office, but, sometimes, it, happens, immediately, following, that, announcement, after, they, have, had, some, opportunity, to, raise, funds, this, is, generally, a, short, and, simple, survey, of, likely, voters, a, benchmark, poll, serves, a, number, of, purposes, for, a, campaign, whether, it, is, a, political, campaign, or, some, other, type, of, campaign, first, it, gives, the, candidate, a, picture, of, where, they, stand, with, the, electorate, before, any, campaigning, takes, place, if, the, poll, is, done, prior, to, announcing, for, office, the, candidate, may, use, the, poll, to, decide, whether, or, not, they, should, even, run, for, office, secondly, it, shows, them, where, their, weaknesses, and, strengths, are, in, two, main, areas, the, first, is, the, electorate, a, benchmark, poll, shows, them, what, types, of, voters, they, are, sure, to, win, those, they, are, sure, to, lose, and, everyone, in, between, these, two, extremes, this, lets, the, campaign, know, which, voters, are, persuadable, so, they, can, spend, their, limited, resources, in, the, most, effective, manner, second, it, can, give, them, an, idea, of, what, messages, ideas, or, slogans, are, the, strongest, with, the, electorate, brushfire, polls, are, polls, taken, during, the, period, between, the, benchmark, poll, and, tracking, polls, the, number, of, brushfire, polls, taken, by, a, campaign, is, determined, by, how, competitive, the, race, is, and, how, much, money, the, campaign, has, to, spend, these, polls, usually, focus, on, likely, voters, and, the, length, of, the, survey, varies, on, the, number, of, messages, being, tested, brushfire, polls, are, used, for, a, number, of, purposes, first, it, lets, the, candidate, know, if, they, have, made, any, progress, on, the, ballot, how, much, progress, has, been, made, and, in, what, demographics, they, have, been, making, or, losing, ground, secondly, it, is, a, way, for, the, campaign, to, test, a, variety, of, messages, both, positive, and, negative, on, themselves, and, their, opponent, s, this, lets, the, campaign, know, what, messages, work, best, with, certain, demographics, and, what, messages, should, be, avoided, campaigns, often, use, these, polls, to, test, possible, attack, messages, that, their, opponent, may, use, and, potential, responses, to, those, attacks, the, campaign, can, then, spend, some, time, preparing, an, effective, response, to, any, likely, attacks, thirdly, this, kind, of, poll, can, be, used, by, candidates, or, political, parties, to, convince, primary, challengers, to, drop, out, of, a, race, and, support, a, stronger, candidate, a, tracking, poll, or, rolling, poll, is, a, poll, in, which, responses, are, obtained, in, a, number, of, consecutive, periods, for, instance, daily, and, then, results, are, calculated, using, a, moving, average, of, the, responses, that, were, gathered, over, a, fixed, number, of, the, most, recent, periods, for, example, the, past, five, days, in, this, example, the, next, calculated, results, will, use, data, for, five, days, counting, backwards, from, the, next, day, namely, the, same, data, as, before, but, with, the, data, from, the, next, day, included, and, without, the, data, from, the, sixth, day, before, that, day, however, these, polls, are, sometimes, subject, to, dramatic, fluctuations, and, so, political, campaigns, and, candidates, are, cautious, in, analyzing, their, results, an, example, of, a, tracking, poll, that, generated, controversy, over, its, accuracy, is, one, conducted, during, the, 2000, u, s, presidential, election, by, the, gallup, organization, the, results, for, one, day, showed, democratic, candidate, al, gore, with, an, eleven, point, lead, over, republican, candidate, george, w, bush, then, a, subsequent, poll, conducted, just, two, days, later, showed, bush, ahead, of, gore, by, seven, points, it, was, soon, determined, that, the, volatility, of, the, results, was, at, least, in, part, due, to, an, uneven, distribution, of, democratic, and, republican, affiliated, voters, in, the, samples, though, the, gallup, organization, argued, the, volatility, in, the, poll, was, a, genuine, representation, of, the, electorate, other, polling, organizations, took, steps, to, reduce, such, wide, variations, in, their, results, one, such, step, included, manipulating, the, proportion, of, democrats, and, republicans, in, any, given, sample, but, this, method, is, subject, to, controversy, over, time, a, number, of, theories, and, mechanisms, have, been, offered, to, explain, erroneous, polling, results, some, of, these, reflect, errors, on, the, part, of, the, pollsters, many, of, them, are, statistical, in, nature, others, blame, the, respondents, for, not, giving, candid, answers, e, g, the, bradley, effect, the, shy, tory, factor, these, can, be, more, controversial, polls, based, on, samples, of, populations, are, subject, to, sampling, error, which, reflects, the, effects, of, chance, and, uncertainty, in, the, sampling, process, sampling, polls, rely, on, the, law, of, large, numbers, to, measure, the, opinions, of, the, whole, population, based, only, on, a, subset, and, for, this, purpose, the, absolute, size, of, the, sample, is, important, but, the, percentage, of, the, whole, population, is, not, important, unless, it, happens, to, be, close, to, the, sample, size, the, possible, difference, between, the, sample, and, whole, population, is, often, expressed, as, a, margin, of, error, usually, defined, as, the, radius, of, a, 95, confidence, interval, for, a, particular, statistic, one, example, is, the, percent, of, people, who, prefer, product, a, versus, product, b, when, a, single, global, margin, of, error, is, reported, for, a, survey, it, refers, to, the, maximum, margin, of, error, for, all, reported, percentages, using, the, full, sample, from, the, survey, if, the, statistic, is, a, percentage, this, maximum, margin, of, error, can, be, calculated, as, the, radius, of, the, confidence, interval, for, a, reported, percentage, of, 50, others, suggest, that, a, poll, with, a, random, sample, of, 1, 000, people, has, margin, of, sampling, error, of, 3, for, the, estimated, percentage, of, the, whole, population, a, 3, margin, of, error, means, that, if, the, same, procedure, is, used, a, large, number, of, times, 95, of, the, time, the, true, population, average, will, be, within, the, sample, estimate, plus, or, minus, 3, the, margin, of, error, can, be, reduced, by, using, a, larger, sample, however, if, a, pollster, wishes, to, reduce, the, margin, of, error, to, 1, they, would, need, a, sample, of, around, 10, 000, people, in, practice, pollsters, need, to, balance, the, cost, of, a, large, sample, against, the, reduction, in, sampling, error, and, a, sample, size, of, around, 500, 1, 000, is, a, typical, compromise, for, political, polls, to, get, complete, responses, it, may, be, necessary, to, include, thousands, of, additional, participators, another, way, to, reduce, the, margin, of, error, is, to, rely, on, poll, averages, this, makes, the, assumption, that, the, procedure, is, similar, enough, between, many, different, polls, and, uses, the, sample, size, of, each, poll, to, create, a, polling, average, another, source, of, error, stems, from, faulty, demographic, models, by, pollsters, who, weigh, their, samples, by, particular, variables, such, as, party, identification, in, an, election, for, example, if, you, assume, that, the, breakdown, of, the, us, population, by, party, identification, has, not, changed, since, the, previous, presidential, election, you, may, underestimate, a, victory, or, a, defeat, of, a, particular, party, candidate, that, saw, a, surge, or, decline, in, its, party, registration, relative, to, the, previous, presidential, election, cycle, a, caution, is, that, an, estimate, of, a, trend, is, subject, to, a, larger, error, than, an, estimate, of, a, level, this, is, because, if, one, estimates, the, change, the, difference, between, two, numbers, x, and, y, then, one, has, to, contend, with, errors, in, both, x, and, y, a, rough, guide, is, that, if, the, change, in, measurement, falls, outside, the, margin, of, error, it, is, worth, attention, since, some, people, do, not, answer, calls, from, strangers, or, refuse, to, answer, the, poll, poll, samples, may, not, be, representative, samples, from, a, population, due, to, a, non, response, bias, response, rates, have, been, declining, and, are, down, to, about, 10, in, recent, years, because, of, this, selection, bias, the, characteristics, of, those, who, agree, to, be, interviewed, may, be, markedly, different, from, those, who, decline, that, is, the, actual, sample, is, a, biased, version, of, the, universe, the, pollster, wants, to, analyze, in, these, cases, bias, introduces, new, errors, one, way, or, the, other, that, are, in, addition, to, errors, caused, by, sample, size, error, due, to, bias, does, not, become, smaller, with, larger, sample, sizes, because, taking, a, larger, sample, size, simply, repeats, the, same, mistake, on, a, larger, scale, if, the, people, who, refuse, to, answer, or, are, never, reached, have, the, same, characteristics, as, the, people, who, do, answer, then, the, final, results, should, be, unbiased, if, the, people, who, do, not, answer, have, different, opinions, then, there, is, bias, in, the, results, in, terms, of, election, polls, studies, suggest, that, bias, effects, are, small, but, each, polling, firm, has, its, own, techniques, for, adjusting, weights, to, minimize, selection, bias, survey, results, may, be, affected, by, response, bias, where, the, answers, given, by, respondents, do, not, reflect, their, true, beliefs, this, may, be, deliberately, engineered, by, unscrupulous, pollsters, in, order, to, generate, a, certain, result, or, please, their, clients, but, more, often, is, a, result, of, the, detailed, wording, or, ordering, of, questions, see, below, respondents, may, deliberately, try, to, manipulate, the, outcome, of, a, poll, by, e, g, advocating, a, more, extreme, position, than, they, actually, hold, in, order, to, boost, their, side, of, the, argument, or, give, rapid, and, ill, considered, answers, in, order, to, hasten, the, end, of, their, questioning, respondents, may, also, feel, under, social, pressure, not, to, give, an, unpopular, answer, for, example, respondents, might, be, unwilling, to, admit, to, unpopular, attitudes, like, racism, or, sexism, and, thus, polls, might, not, reflect, the, true, incidence, of, these, attitudes, in, the, population, in, american, political, parlance, this, phenomenon, is, often, referred, to, as, the, bradley, effect, if, the, results, of, surveys, are, widely, publicized, this, effect, may, be, magnified, a, phenomenon, commonly, referred, to, as, the, spiral, of, silence, use, of, the, plurality, voting, system, select, only, one, candidate, in, a, poll, puts, an, unintentional, bias, into, the, poll, since, people, who, favor, more, than, one, candidate, cannot, indicate, this, the, fact, that, they, must, choose, only, one, candidate, biases, the, poll, causing, it, to, favor, the, candidate, most, different, from, the, others, while, it, disfavors, candidates, who, are, similar, to, other, candidates, the, plurality, voting, system, also, biases, elections, in, the, same, way, some, people, responding, may, not, understand, the, words, being, used, but, may, wish, to, avoid, the, embarrassment, of, admitting, this, or, the, poll, mechanism, may, not, allow, clarification, so, they, may, make, an, arbitrary, choice, some, percentage, of, people, also, answer, whimsically, or, out, of, annoyance, at, being, polled, this, results, in, perhaps, 4, of, americans, reporting, they, have, personally, been, decapitated, among, the, factors, that, impact, the, results, of, opinion, polls, are, the, wording, and, order, of, the, questions, being, posed, by, the, surveyor, questions, that, intentionally, affect, a, respondents, answer, are, referred, to, as, leading, questions, individuals, and, or, groups, use, these, types, of, questions, in, surveys, to, elicit, responses, favorable, to, their, interests, for, instance, the, public, is, more, likely, to, indicate, support, for, a, person, who, is, described, by, the, surveyor, as, one, of, the, leading, candidates, this, description, is, leading, as, it, indicates, a, subtle, bias, for, that, candidate, since, it, implies, that, the, others, in, the, race, are, not, serious, contenders, additionally, leading, questions, often, contain, or, lack, certain, facts, that, can, sway, a, respondent, s, answer, argumentative, questions, can, also, impact, the, outcome, of, a, survey, these, types, of, questions, depending, on, their, nature, either, positive, or, negative, influence, respondents, answers, to, reflect, the, tone, of, the, question, s, and, generate, a, certain, response, or, reaction, rather, than, gauge, sentiment, in, an, unbiased, manner, in, opinion, polling, there, are, also, loaded, questions, otherwise, known, as, trick, questions, this, type, of, leading, question, may, concern, an, uncomfortable, or, controversial, issue, and, or, automatically, assume, the, subject, of, the, question, is, related, to, the, respondent, s, or, that, they, are, knowledgeable, about, it, likewise, the, questions, are, then, worded, in, a, way, that, limit, the, possible, answers, typically, to, yes, or, no, another, type, of, question, that, can, produce, inaccurate, results, are, double, negative, questions, these, are, more, often, the, result, of, human, error, rather, than, intentional, manipulation, one, such, example, is, a, survey, done, in, 1992, by, the, roper, organization, concerning, the, holocaust, the, question, read, does, it, seem, possible, or, impossible, to, you, that, the, nazi, extermination, of, the, jews, never, happened, the, confusing, wording, of, this, question, led, to, inaccurate, results, which, indicated, that, 22, percent, of, respondents, believed, it, seemed, possible, the, holocaust, might, not, have, ever, happened, when, the, question, was, reworded, significantly, fewer, respondents, only, 1, percent, expressed, that, same, sentiment, thus, comparisons, between, polls, often, boil, down, to, the, wording, of, the, question, on, some, issues, question, wording, can, result, in, quite, pronounced, differences, between, surveys, this, can, also, however, be, a, result, of, legitimately, conflicted, feelings, or, evolving, attitudes, rather, than, a, poorly, constructed, survey, a, common, technique, to, control, for, this, bias, is, to, rotate, the, order, in, which, questions, are, asked, many, pollsters, also, split, sample, this, involves, having, two, different, versions, of, a, question, with, each, version, presented, to, half, the, respondents, the, most, effective, controls, used, by, attitude, researchers, are, these, controls, are, not, widely, used, in, the, polling, industry, however, as, it, is, important, that, questions, to, test, the, product, have, a, high, quality, survey, methodologists, work, on, methods, to, test, them, empirical, tests, provide, insight, into, the, quality, of, the, questionnaire, some, may, be, more, complex, than, others, for, instance, testing, a, questionnaire, can, be, done, by, one, of, the, criticisms, of, opinion, polls, is, that, societal, assumptions, that, opinions, between, which, there, is, no, logical, link, are, correlated, attitudes, can, push, people, with, one, opinion, into, a, group, that, forces, them, to, pretend, to, have, a, supposedly, linked, but, actually, unrelated, opinion, that, in, turn, may, cause, people, who, have, the, first, opinion, to, claim, on, polls, that, they, have, the, second, opinion, without, having, it, causing, opinion, polls, to, become, part, of, self, fulfilling, prophecy, problems, it, has, been, suggested, that, attempts, to, counteract, unethical, opinions, by, condemning, supposedly, linked, opinions, may, favor, the, groups, that, promote, the, actually, unethical, opinions, by, forcing, people, with, supposedly, linked, opinions, into, them, by, ostracism, elsewhere, in, society, making, such, efforts, counterproductive, that, not, being, sent, between, groups, that, assume, ulterior, motives, from, each, other, and, not, being, allowed, to, express, consistent, critical, thought, anywhere, may, create, psychological, stress, because, humans, are, sapient, and, that, discussion, spaces, free, from, assumptions, of, ulterior, motives, behind, specific, opinions, should, be, created, in, this, context, rejection, of, the, assumption, that, opinion, polls, show, actual, links, between, opinions, is, considered, important, another, source, of, error, is, the, use, of, samples, that, are, not, representative, of, the, population, as, a, consequence, of, the, methodology, used, as, was, the, experience, of, the, literary, digest, in, 1936, for, example, telephone, sampling, has, a, built, in, error, because, in, many, times, and, places, those, with, telephones, have, generally, been, richer, than, those, without, in, some, places, many, people, have, only, mobile, telephones, because, pollsters, cannot, use, automated, dialing, machines, to, call, mobile, phones, in, the, united, states, because, the, phone, s, owner, may, be, charged, for, taking, a, call, these, individuals, are, typically, excluded, from, polling, samples, there, is, concern, that, if, the, subset, of, the, population, without, cell, phones, differs, markedly, from, the, rest, of, the, population, these, differences, can, skew, the, results, of, the, poll, polling, organizations, have, developed, many, weighting, techniques, to, help, overcome, these, deficiencies, with, varying, degrees, of, success, studies, of, mobile, phone, users, by, the, pew, research, center, in, the, us, in, 2007, concluded, that, cell, only, respondents, are, different, from, landline, respondents, in, important, ways, but, they, were, neither, numerous, enough, nor, different, enough, on, the, questions, we, examined, to, produce, a, significant, change, in, overall, general, population, survey, estimates, when, included, with, the, landline, samples, and, weighted, according, to, us, census, parameters, on, basic, demographic, characteristics, this, issue, was, first, identified, in, 2004, but, came, to, prominence, only, during, the, 2008, us, presidential, election, in, previous, elections, the, proportion, of, the, general, population, using, cell, phones, was, small, but, as, this, proportion, has, increased, there, is, concern, that, polling, only, landlines, is, no, longer, representative, of, the, general, population, in, 2003, only, 2, 9, of, households, were, wireless, cellphones, only, compared, to, 12, 8, in, 2006, this, results, in, coverage, error, many, polling, organisations, select, their, sample, by, dialling, random, telephone, numbers, however, in, 2008, there, was, a, clear, tendency, for, polls, which, included, mobile, phones, in, their, samples, to, show, a, much, larger, lead, for, obama, than, polls, that, did, not, the, potential, sources, of, bias, are, some, polling, companies, have, attempted, to, get, around, that, problem, by, including, a, cellphone, supplement, there, are, a, number, of, problems, with, including, cellphones, in, a, telephone, poll, an, oft, quoted, example, of, opinion, polls, succumbing, to, errors, occurred, during, the, 1992, uk, general, election, despite, the, polling, organizations, using, different, methodologies, virtually, all, the, polls, taken, before, the, vote, and, to, a, lesser, extent, exit, polls, taken, on, voting, day, showed, a, lead, for, the, opposition, labour, party, while, the, actual, vote, gave, a, clear, victory, to, the, ruling, conservative, party, in, their, deliberations, after, this, embarrassment, the, pollsters, advanced, several, ideas, to, account, for, their, errors, including, the, relative, importance, of, these, factors, was, and, remains, a, matter, of, controversy, polling, organizations, have, since, then, adjusted, their, methodologies, and, have, achieved, more, accurate, results, in, subsequent, election, campaigns, a, comprehensive, discussion, of, these, biases, and, how, they, should, be, understood, and, mitigated, is, included, in, several, sources, including, dillman, and, salant, 1994, a, widely, publicized, failure, of, opinion, polling, to, date, in, the, united, states, was, the, prediction, that, thomas, dewey, would, defeat, harry, s, truman, in, the, 1948, us, presidential, election, major, polling, organizations, including, gallup, and, roper, had, indicated, that, dewey, would, defeat, truman, in, a, landslide, truman, won, a, narrow, victory, there, were, also, substantial, polling, errors, in, the, presidential, elections, of, 1952, 1980, 1996, 2000, and, 2016, while, the, first, three, correctly, predicted, the, winner, albeit, not, the, extent, of, their, winning, margin, with, the, last, two, correctly, predicting, the, winner, of, the, popular, vote, but, not, the, electoral, college, in, the, united, kingdom, most, polls, failed, to, predict, the, conservative, election, victories, of, 1970, and, 1992, and, labour, s, victory, in, february, 1974, in, the, 2015, election, virtually, every, poll, predicted, a, hung, parliament, with, labour, and, the, conservatives, neck, and, neck, when, the, actual, result, was, a, clear, conservative, majority, on, the, other, hand, in, 2017, the, opposite, appears, to, have, occurred, most, polls, predicted, an, increased, conservative, majority, even, though, in, reality, the, election, resulted, in, a, hung, parliament, with, a, conservative, plurality, some, polls, correctly, predicted, this, outcome, in, new, zealand, the, polls, leading, up, to, the, 1993, general, election, predicted, the, governing, national, party, would, increase, its, majority, however, the, preliminary, results, on, election, night, showed, a, hung, parliament, with, national, one, seat, short, of, a, majority, leading, to, prime, minister, jim, bolger, exclaiming, bugger, the, pollsters, on, live, national, television, the, official, count, saw, national, gain, waitaki, to, hold, a, one, seat, majority, and, retain, government, social, media, today, is, a, popular, medium, for, the, candidates, to, campaign, and, for, gauging, the, public, reaction, to, the, campaigns, social, media, can, also, be, used, as, an, indicator, of, the, voter, opinion, regarding, the, poll, some, research, studies, have, shown, that, predictions, made, using, social, media, signals, can, match, traditional, opinion, polls, regarding, the, 2016, u, s, presidential, election, a, major, concern, has, been, that, of, the, effect, of, false, stories, spread, throughout, social, media, evidence, shows, that, social, media, plays, a, huge, role, in, the, supplying, of, news, 62, percent, of, us, adults, get, news, on, social, media, this, fact, makes, the, issue, of, fake, news, on, social, media, more, pertinent, other, evidence, shows, that, the, most, popular, fake, news, stories, were, more, widely, shared, on, facebook, than, the, most, popular, mainstream, news, stories, many, people, who, see, fake, news, stories, report, that, they, believe, them, and, the, most, discussed, fake, news, stories, tended, to, favor, donald, trump, over, hillary, clinton, as, a, result, of, these, facts, some, have, concluded, that, if, not, for, these, stories, donald, trump, may, not, have, won, the, election, over, hillary, clinton, by, providing, information, about, voting, intentions, opinion, polls, can, sometimes, influence, the, behavior, of, electors, and, in, his, book, the, broken, compass, peter, hitchens, asserts, that, opinion, polls, are, actually, a, device, for, influencing, public, opinion, the, various, theories, about, how, this, happens, can, be, split, into, two, groups, bandwagon, underdog, effects, and, strategic, tactical, voting, a, bandwagon, effect, occurs, when, the, poll, prompts, voters, to, back, the, candidate, shown, to, be, winning, in, the, poll, the, idea, that, voters, are, susceptible, to, such, effects, is, old, stemming, at, least, from, 1884, william, safire, reported, that, the, term, was, first, used, in, a, political, cartoon, in, the, magazine, puck, in, that, year, it, has, also, remained, persistent, in, spite, of, a, lack, of, empirical, corroboration, until, the, late, 20th, century, george, gallup, spent, much, effort, in, vain, trying, to, discredit, this, theory, in, his, time, by, presenting, empirical, research, a, recent, meta, study, of, scientific, research, on, this, topic, indicates, that, from, the, 1980s, onward, the, bandwagon, effect, is, found, more, often, by, researchers, the, opposite, of, the, bandwagon, effect, is, the, underdog, effect, it, is, often, mentioned, in, the, media, this, occurs, when, people, vote, out, of, sympathy, for, the, party, perceived, to, be, losing, the, elections, there, is, less, empirical, evidence, for, the, existence, of, this, effect, than, there, is, for, the, existence, of, the, bandwagon, effect, the, second, category, of, theories, on, how, polls, directly, affect, voting, is, called, strategic, voting, this, theory, is, based, on, the, idea, that, voters, view, the, act, of, voting, as, a, means, of, selecting, a, government, thus, they, will, sometimes, not, choose, the, candidate, they, prefer, on, ground, of, ideology, or, sympathy, but, another, less, preferred, candidate, from, strategic, considerations, an, example, can, be, found, in, the, 1997, united, kingdom, general, election, as, he, was, then, a, cabinet, minister, michael, portillo, s, constituency, of, enfield, southgate, was, believed, to, be, a, safe, seat, but, opinion, polls, showed, the, labour, candidate, stephen, twigg, steadily, gaining, support, which, may, have, prompted, undecided, voters, or, supporters, of, other, parties, to, support, twigg, in, order, to, remove, portillo, another, example, is, the, boomerang, effect, where, the, likely, supporters, of, the, candidate, shown, to, be, winning, feel, that, chances, are, slim, and, that, their, vote, is, not, required, thus, allowing, another, candidate, to, win, for, party, list, proportional, representation, opinion, polling, helps, voters, avoid, wasting, their, vote, on, a, party, below, the, electoral, threshold, in, addition, mark, pickup, in, cameron, anderson, and, laura, stephenson, s, voting, behaviour, in, canada, outlines, three, additional, behavioural, responses, that, voters, may, exhibit, when, faced, with, polling, data, the, first, is, known, as, a, cue, taking, effect, which, holds, that, poll, data, is, used, as, a, proxy, for, information, about, the, candidates, or, parties, cue, taking, is, based, on, the, psychological, phenomenon, of, using, heuristics, to, simplify, a, complex, decision, 243, the, second, first, described, by, petty, and, cacioppo, 1996, is, known, as, cognitive, response, theory, this, theory, asserts, that, a, voter, s, response, to, a, poll, may, not, line, with, their, initial, conception, of, the, electoral, reality, in, response, the, voter, is, likely, to, generate, a, mental, list, in, which, they, create, reasons, for, a, party, s, loss, or, gain, in, the, polls, this, can, reinforce, or, change, their, opinion, of, the, candidate, and, thus, affect, voting, behaviour, third, the, final, possibility, is, a, behavioural, response, which, is, similar, to, a, cognitive, response, the, only, salient, difference, is, that, a, voter, will, go, and, seek, new, information, to, form, their, mental, list, thus, becoming, more, informed, of, the, election, this, may, then, affect, voting, behaviour, these, effects, indicate, how, opinion, polls, can, directly, affect, political, choices, of, the, electorate, but, directly, or, indirectly, other, effects, can, be, surveyed, and, analyzed, on, all, political, parties, the, form, of, media, framing, and, party, ideology, shifts, must, also, be, taken, under, consideration, opinion, polling, in, some, instances, is, a, measure, of, cognitive, bias, which, is, variably, considered, and, handled, appropriately, in, its, various, applications, in, turn, non, nuanced, reporting, by, the, media, about, poll, data, and, public, opinions, can, thus, even, aggravate, political, polarization, starting, in, the, 1980s, tracking, polls, and, related, technologies, began, having, a, notable, impact, on, u, s, political, leaders, according, to, douglas, bailey, a, republican, who, had, helped, run, gerald, ford, s, 1976, presidential, campaign, it, s, no, longer, necessary, for, a, political, candidate, to, guess, what, an, audience, thinks, he, can, with, a, nightly, tracking, poll, so, it, s, no, longer, likely, that, political, leaders, are, going, to, lead, instead, they, re, going, to, follow, some, jurisdictions, over, the, world, restrict, the, publication, of, the, results, of, opinion, polls, especially, during, the, period, around, an, election, in, order, to, prevent, the, possibly, erroneous, results, from, affecting, voters, decisions, for, instance, in, canada, it, is, prohibited, to, publish, the, results, of, opinion, surveys, that, would, identify, specific, political, parties, or, candidates, in, the, final, three, days, before, a, poll, closes, however, most, western, democratic, nations, do, not, support, the, entire, prohibition, of, the, publication, of, pre, election, opinion, polls, most, of, them, have, no, regulation, and, some, only, prohibit, it, in, the, final, days, or, hours, until, the, relevant, poll, closes, a, survey, by, canada, s, royal, commission, on, electoral, reform, reported, that, the, prohibition, period, of, publication, of, the, survey, results, largely, differed, in, different, countries, out, of, the, 20, countries, examined, 3, prohibit, the, publication, during, the, entire, period, of, campaigns, while, others, prohibit, it, for, a, shorter, term, such, as, the, polling, period, or, the, final, 48, hours, before, a, poll, closes, in, india, the, election, commission, has, prohibited, it, in, the, 48, hours, before, the, start, of, polling, the, director, of, the, levada, center, stated, in, 2015, that, drawing, conclusions, from, russian, poll, results, or, comparing, them, to, polls, in, democratic, states, was, irrelevant, as, there, is, no, real, political, competition, in, russia, where, unlike, in, democratic, states, russian, voters, are, not, offered, any, credible, alternatives, and, public, opinion, is, primarily, formed, by, state, controlled, media, which, promotes, those, in, power, and, discredits, alternative, candidates, many, respondents, in, russia, do, not, want, to, answer, pollsters, questions, for, fear, of, negative, consequences, on, 23, march, 2023, criminal, case, was, opened, against, moscow, resident, yury, kokhovets, a, participant, in, the, radio, liberty, street, poll, he, faced, up, to, 10, years, in, prison, under, russia, s, 2022, war, censorship, laws
