https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation
heterodox, in, economics, deflation, is, a, decrease, in, the, general, price, level, of, goods, and, services, deflation, occurs, when, the, inflation, rate, falls, below, 0, a, negative, inflation, rate, inflation, reduces, the, value, of, currency, over, time, but, deflation, increases, it, this, allows, more, goods, and, services, to, be, bought, than, before, with, the, same, amount, of, currency, deflation, is, distinct, from, disinflation, a, slowdown, in, the, inflation, rate, i, e, when, inflation, declines, to, a, lower, rate, but, is, still, positive, economists, generally, believe, that, a, sudden, deflationary, shock, is, a, problem, in, a, modern, economy, because, it, increases, the, real, value, of, debt, especially, if, the, deflation, is, unexpected, deflation, may, also, aggravate, recessions, and, lead, to, a, deflationary, spiral, see, later, section, some, economists, argue, that, prolonged, deflationary, periods, are, related, to, the, underlying, technological, progress, in, an, economy, because, as, productivity, increases, tfp, the, cost, of, goods, decreases, deflation, usually, happens, when, supply, is, high, when, excess, production, occurs, when, demand, is, low, when, consumption, decreases, or, when, the, money, supply, decreases, sometimes, in, response, to, a, contraction, created, from, careless, investment, or, a, credit, crunch, or, because, of, a, net, capital, outflow, from, the, economy, it, can, also, occur, when, there, is, too, much, competition, and, too, little, market, concentration, in, the, is, lm, model, investment, and, saving, equilibrium, liquidity, preference, and, money, supply, equilibrium, model, deflation, is, caused, by, a, shift, in, the, supply, and, demand, curve, for, goods, and, services, this, in, turn, can, be, caused, by, an, increase, in, supply, a, fall, in, demand, or, both, when, prices, are, falling, consumers, have, an, incentive, to, delay, purchases, and, consumption, until, prices, fall, further, which, in, turn, reduces, overall, economic, activity, when, purchases, are, delayed, productive, capacity, is, idled, and, investment, falls, leading, to, further, reductions, in, aggregate, demand, this, is, the, deflationary, spiral, the, way, to, reverse, this, quickly, would, be, to, introduce, an, economic, stimulus, the, government, could, increase, productive, spending, on, things, like, infrastructure, or, the, central, bank, could, start, expanding, the, money, supply, deflation, is, also, related, to, risk, aversion, where, investors, and, buyers, will, start, hoarding, money, because, its, value, is, now, increasing, over, time, this, can, produce, a, liquidity, trap, or, it, may, lead, to, shortages, that, entice, investments, yielding, more, jobs, and, commodity, production, a, central, bank, cannot, normally, charge, negative, interest, for, money, and, even, charging, zero, interest, often, produces, less, stimulative, effect, than, slightly, higher, rates, of, interest, in, a, closed, economy, this, is, because, charging, zero, interest, also, means, having, zero, return, on, government, securities, or, even, negative, return, on, short, maturities, in, an, open, economy, it, creates, a, carry, trade, and, devalues, the, currency, a, devalued, currency, produces, higher, prices, for, imports, without, necessarily, stimulating, exports, to, a, like, degree, deflation, is, the, natural, condition, of, economies, when, the, supply, of, money, is, fixed, or, does, not, grow, as, quickly, as, population, and, the, economy, when, this, happens, the, available, amount, of, hard, currency, per, person, falls, in, effect, making, money, more, scarce, and, consequently, the, purchasing, power, of, each, unit, of, currency, increases, deflation, also, occurs, when, improvements, in, production, efficiency, lower, the, overall, price, of, goods, competition, in, the, marketplace, often, prompts, those, producers, to, apply, at, least, some, portion, of, these, cost, savings, into, reducing, the, asking, price, for, their, goods, when, this, happens, consumers, pay, less, for, those, goods, and, consequently, deflation, has, occurred, since, purchasing, power, has, increased, rising, productivity, and, reduced, transportation, cost, created, structural, deflation, during, the, accelerated, productivity, era, from, 1870, to, 1900, but, there, was, mild, inflation, for, about, a, decade, before, the, establishment, of, the, federal, reserve, in, 1913, there, was, inflation, during, world, war, i, but, deflation, returned, again, after, the, war, and, during, the, 1930s, depression, most, nations, abandoned, the, gold, standard, in, the, 1930s, so, that, there, is, less, reason, to, expect, deflation, aside, from, the, collapse, of, speculative, asset, classes, under, a, fiat, monetary, system, with, low, productivity, growth, in, mainstream, economics, deflation, may, be, caused, by, a, combination, of, the, supply, and, demand, for, goods, and, the, supply, and, demand, for, money, specifically, the, supply, of, money, going, down, and, the, supply, of, goods, going, up, historic, episodes, of, deflation, have, often, been, associated, with, the, supply, of, goods, going, up, due, to, increased, productivity, without, an, increase, in, the, supply, of, money, or, as, with, the, great, depression, and, possibly, japan, in, the, early, 1990s, the, demand, for, goods, going, down, combined, with, a, decrease, in, the, money, supply, studies, of, the, great, depression, by, ben, bernanke, have, indicated, that, in, response, to, decreased, demand, the, federal, reserve, of, the, time, decreased, the, money, supply, hence, contributing, to, deflation, causes, include, on, the, demand, side, and, on, the, supply, side, growth, deflation, is, an, enduring, decrease, in, the, real, cost, of, goods, and, services, as, the, result, of, technological, progress, accompanied, by, competitive, price, cuts, resulting, in, an, increase, in, aggregate, demand, a, structural, deflation, existed, from, the, 1870s, until, the, cycle, upswing, that, started, in, 1895, the, deflation, was, caused, by, the, decrease, in, the, production, and, distribution, costs, of, goods, it, resulted, in, competitive, price, cuts, when, markets, were, oversupplied, the, mild, inflation, after, 1895, was, attributed, to, the, increase, in, gold, supply, that, had, been, occurring, for, decades, there, was, a, sharp, rise, in, prices, during, world, war, i, but, deflation, returned, at, the, war, s, end, by, contrast, under, a, fiat, monetary, system, there, was, high, productivity, growth, from, the, end, of, world, war, ii, until, the, 1960s, but, no, deflation, historically, not, all, episodes, of, deflation, correspond, with, periods, of, poor, economic, growth, productivity, and, deflation, are, discussed, in, a, 1940, study, by, the, brookings, institution, that, gives, productivity, by, major, us, industries, from, 1919, to, 1939, along, with, real, and, nominal, wages, persistent, deflation, was, clearly, understood, as, being, the, result, of, the, enormous, gains, in, productivity, of, the, period, by, the, late, 1920s, most, goods, were, over, supplied, which, contributed, to, high, unemployment, during, the, great, depression, bank, credit, deflation, is, a, decrease, in, the, bank, credit, supply, due, to, bank, failures, or, increased, perceived, risk, of, defaults, by, private, entities, or, a, contraction, of, the, money, supply, by, the, central, bank, debt, deflation, is, a, complicated, phenomenon, associated, with, the, end, of, long, term, credit, cycles, it, was, proposed, as, a, theory, by, irving, fisher, 1933, to, explain, the, deflation, of, the, great, depression, from, a, monetarist, perspective, deflation, is, caused, primarily, by, a, reduction, in, the, velocity, of, money, or, the, amount, of, money, supply, per, person, a, historical, analysis, of, money, velocity, and, monetary, base, shows, an, inverse, correlation, for, a, given, percentage, decrease, in, the, monetary, base, the, result, is, a, nearly, equal, percentage, increase, in, money, velocity, this, is, to, be, expected, because, monetary, base, m, b, velocity, of, base, money, v, b, price, level, p, and, real, output, y, are, related, by, definition, m, b, v, b, p, y, however, the, monetary, base, is, a, much, narrower, definition, of, money, than, m2, money, supply, additionally, the, velocity, of, the, monetary, base, is, interest, rate, sensitive, the, highest, velocity, being, at, the, highest, interest, rates, in, the, early, history, of, the, united, states, there, was, no, national, currency, and, an, insufficient, supply, of, coinage, banknotes, were, the, majority, of, the, money, in, circulation, during, financial, crises, many, banks, failed, and, their, notes, became, worthless, also, banknotes, were, discounted, relative, to, gold, and, silver, the, discount, depended, on, the, financial, strength, of, the, bank, in, recent, years, changes, in, the, money, supply, have, historically, taken, a, long, time, to, show, up, in, the, price, level, with, a, rule, of, thumb, lag, of, at, least, 18, months, more, recently, alan, greenspan, cited, the, time, lag, as, taking, between, 12, and, 13, quarters, bonds, equities, and, commodities, have, been, suggested, as, reservoirs, for, buffering, changes, in, the, money, supply, in, modern, credit, based, economies, deflation, may, be, caused, by, the, central, bank, initiating, higher, interest, rates, i, e, to, control, inflation, thereby, possibly, popping, an, asset, bubble, in, a, credit, based, economy, a, slow, down, or, fall, in, lending, leads, to, less, money, in, circulation, with, a, further, sharp, fall, in, money, supply, as, confidence, reduces, and, velocity, weakens, with, a, consequent, sharp, fall, off, in, demand, for, employment, or, goods, the, fall, in, demand, causes, a, fall, in, prices, as, a, supply, glut, develops, this, becomes, a, deflationary, spiral, when, prices, fall, below, the, costs, of, financing, production, or, repaying, debt, levels, incurred, at, the, prior, price, level, businesses, unable, to, make, enough, profit, no, matter, how, low, they, set, prices, are, then, liquidated, banks, get, assets, that, have, fallen, dramatically, in, value, since, their, mortgage, loan, was, made, and, if, they, sell, those, assets, they, further, glut, supply, which, only, exacerbates, the, situation, to, slow, or, halt, the, deflationary, spiral, banks, will, often, withhold, collecting, on, non, performing, loans, as, in, japan, and, most, recently, america, and, spain, this, is, often, no, more, than, a, stop, gap, measure, because, they, must, then, restrict, credit, since, they, do, not, have, money, to, lend, which, further, reduces, demand, and, so, on, in, the, early, economic, history, of, the, united, states, cycles, of, inflation, and, deflation, correlated, with, capital, flows, between, regions, with, money, being, loaned, from, the, financial, center, in, the, northeast, to, the, commodity, producing, regions, of, the, mid, west, and, south, in, a, procyclical, manner, prices, of, commodities, rose, when, capital, was, flowing, in, that, is, when, banks, were, willing, to, lend, and, fell, in, the, depression, years, of, 1818, and, 1839, when, banks, called, in, loans, also, there, was, no, national, paper, currency, at, the, time, and, there, was, a, scarcity, of, coins, most, money, circulated, as, banknotes, which, typically, sold, at, a, discount, according, to, distance, from, the, issuing, bank, and, the, bank, s, perceived, financial, strength, when, banks, failed, their, notes, were, redeemed, for, bank, reserves, which, often, did, not, result, in, payment, at, par, value, and, sometimes, the, notes, became, worthless, notes, of, weak, surviving, banks, traded, at, steep, discounts, during, the, great, depression, people, who, owed, money, to, a, bank, whose, deposits, had, been, frozen, would, sometimes, buy, bank, books, deposits, of, other, people, at, the, bank, at, a, discount, and, use, them, to, pay, off, their, debt, at, par, value, deflation, occurred, periodically, in, the, u, s, during, the, 19th, century, the, most, important, exception, was, during, the, civil, war, this, deflation, was, at, times, caused, by, technological, progress, that, created, significant, economic, growth, but, at, other, times, it, was, triggered, by, financial, crises, notably, the, panic, of, 1837, which, caused, deflation, through, 1844, and, the, panic, of, 1873, which, triggered, the, long, depression, that, lasted, until, 1879, these, deflationary, periods, preceded, the, establishment, of, the, u, s, federal, reserve, system, and, its, active, management, of, monetary, matters, episodes, of, deflation, have, been, rare, and, brief, since, the, federal, reserve, was, created, a, notable, exception, being, the, great, depression, while, u, s, economic, progress, has, been, unprecedented, a, financial, crisis, in, england, in, 1818, caused, banks, to, call, in, loans, and, curtail, new, lending, draining, specie, out, of, the, u, s, the, bank, of, the, united, states, also, reduced, its, lending, prices, for, cotton, and, tobacco, fell, the, price, of, agricultural, commodities, also, was, pressured, by, a, return, of, normal, harvests, following, 1816, the, year, without, a, summer, that, caused, large, scale, famine, and, high, agricultural, prices, there, were, several, causes, of, the, deflation, of, the, severe, depression, of, 1839, 1843, which, included, an, oversupply, of, agricultural, commodities, importantly, cotton, as, new, cropland, came, into, production, following, large, federal, land, sales, a, few, years, earlier, banks, requiring, payment, in, gold, or, silver, the, failure, of, several, banks, default, by, several, states, on, their, bonds, and, british, banks, cutting, back, on, specie, flow, to, the, u, s, this, cycle, has, been, traced, out, on, a, broad, scale, during, the, great, depression, partly, because, of, overcapacity, and, market, saturation, and, partly, as, a, result, of, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, international, trade, contracted, sharply, severely, reducing, demand, for, goods, thereby, idling, a, great, deal, of, capacity, and, setting, off, a, string, of, bank, failures, a, similar, situation, in, japan, beginning, with, the, stock, and, real, estate, market, collapse, in, the, early, 1990s, was, arrested, by, the, japanese, government, preventing, the, collapse, of, most, banks, and, taking, over, direct, control, of, several, in, the, worst, condition, the, united, states, had, no, national, paper, money, until, 1862, greenbacks, used, to, fund, the, civil, war, but, these, notes, were, discounted, to, gold, until, 1877, there, was, also, a, shortage, of, u, s, minted, coins, foreign, coins, such, as, mexican, silver, were, commonly, used, at, times, banknotes, were, as, much, as, 80, of, currency, in, circulation, before, the, civil, war, in, the, financial, crises, of, 1818, 19, and, 1837, 1841, many, banks, failed, leaving, their, money, to, be, redeemed, below, par, value, from, reserves, sometimes, the, notes, became, worthless, and, the, notes, of, weak, surviving, banks, were, heavily, discounted, the, jackson, administration, opened, branch, mints, which, over, time, increased, the, supply, of, coins, following, the, 1848, finding, of, gold, in, the, sierra, nevada, enough, gold, came, to, market, to, devalue, gold, relative, to, silver, to, equalize, the, value, of, the, two, metals, in, coinage, the, us, mint, slightly, reduced, the, silver, content, of, new, coinage, in, 1853, when, structural, deflation, appeared, in, the, years, following, 1870, a, common, explanation, given, by, various, government, inquiry, committees, was, a, scarcity, of, gold, and, silver, although, they, usually, mentioned, the, changes, in, industry, and, trade, we, now, call, productivity, however, david, a, wells, 1890, notes, that, the, u, s, money, supply, during, the, period, 1879, 1889, actually, rose, 60, the, increase, being, in, gold, and, silver, which, rose, against, the, percentage, of, national, bank, and, legal, tender, notes, furthermore, wells, argued, that, the, deflation, only, lowered, the, cost, of, goods, that, benefited, from, recent, improved, methods, of, manufacturing, and, transportation, goods, produced, by, craftsmen, did, not, decrease, in, price, nor, did, many, services, and, the, cost, of, labor, actually, increased, also, deflation, did, not, occur, in, countries, that, did, not, have, modern, manufacturing, transportation, and, communications, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, deflation, ended, and, turned, to, mild, inflation, william, stanley, jevons, predicted, rising, gold, supply, would, cause, inflation, decades, before, it, actually, did, irving, fisher, blamed, the, worldwide, inflation, of, the, pre, wwi, years, on, rising, gold, supply, in, economies, with, an, unstable, currency, barter, and, other, alternate, currency, arrangements, such, as, dollarization, are, common, and, therefore, when, the, official, money, becomes, scarce, or, unusually, unreliable, commerce, can, still, continue, e, g, most, recently, in, zimbabwe, since, in, such, economies, the, central, government, is, often, unable, even, if, it, were, willing, to, adequately, control, the, internal, economy, there, is, no, pressing, need, for, individuals, to, acquire, official, currency, except, to, pay, for, imported, goods, if, a, country, pegs, its, currency, to, one, of, another, country, that, features, a, higher, productivity, growth, or, a, more, favourable, unit, cost, development, it, must, to, maintain, its, competitiveness, either, become, equally, more, productive, or, lower, its, factor, prices, e, g, wages, cutting, factor, prices, fosters, deflation, monetary, unions, have, a, similar, effect, to, currency, pegs, some, believe, that, in, the, absence, of, large, amounts, of, debt, deflation, would, be, a, welcome, effect, because, the, lowering, of, prices, increases, purchasing, power, however, while, an, increase, in, the, purchasing, power, of, one, s, money, benefits, some, it, amplifies, the, sting, of, debt, for, others, after, a, period, of, deflation, the, payments, to, service, a, debt, represent, a, larger, amount, of, purchasing, power, than, they, did, when, the, debt, was, first, incurred, consequently, deflation, can, be, thought, of, as, an, effective, increase, in, a, loan, s, interest, rate, if, as, during, the, great, depression, in, the, united, states, deflation, averages, 10, per, year, even, an, interest, free, loan, is, unattractive, as, it, must, be, repaid, with, money, worth, 10, more, each, year, under, normal, conditions, most, central, banks, such, as, the, federal, reserve, implement, policy, by, setting, a, target, for, a, short, term, interest, rate, the, overnight, federal, funds, rate, in, the, u, s, and, enforcing, that, target, by, buying, and, selling, securities, in, open, capital, markets, when, the, short, term, interest, rate, hits, zero, the, central, bank, can, no, longer, ease, policy, by, lowering, its, usual, interest, rate, target, with, interest, rates, near, zero, debt, relief, becomes, an, increasingly, important, tool, in, managing, deflation, in, recent, times, as, loan, terms, have, grown, in, length, and, loan, financing, or, leveraging, is, common, among, many, types, of, investments, the, costs, of, deflation, to, borrowers, has, grown, larger, deflation, can, discourage, private, investment, because, there, is, reduced, expectations, on, future, profits, when, future, prices, are, lower, consequently, with, reduced, private, investments, spiraling, deflation, can, cause, a, collapse, in, aggregate, demand, without, the, hidden, risk, of, inflation, it, may, become, more, prudent, for, institutions, to, hold, on, to, money, and, not, to, spend, or, invest, it, burying, money, they, are, therefore, rewarded, by, saving, and, holding, money, this, hoarding, behavior, is, seen, as, undesirable, by, most, economists, friedrich, hayek, a, libertarian, austrian, school, economist, wrote, that, it, is, agreed, that, hoarding, money, whether, in, cash, or, in, idle, balances, is, deflationary, in, its, effects, no, one, thinks, that, deflation, is, in, itself, desirable, deflation, causes, a, transfer, of, wealth, from, borrowers, and, holders, of, illiquid, assets, to, the, benefit, of, savers, and, of, holders, of, liquid, assets, and, currency, and, because, confused, price, signals, cause, malinvestment, in, the, form, of, underinvestment, in, this, sense, its, effects, are, the, opposite, of, inflation, the, effect, of, which, is, to, transfer, wealth, from, currency, holders, and, lenders, savers, and, to, borrowers, including, governments, and, cause, overinvestment, whereas, inflation, encourages, short, term, consumption, and, can, similarly, overstimulate, investment, in, projects, that, may, not, be, worthwhile, in, real, terms, for, example, the, dot, com, and, housing, bubbles, deflation, reduces, investment, even, when, there, is, a, real, world, demand, not, being, met, in, modern, economies, deflation, is, usually, associated, with, economic, depression, as, occurred, in, the, great, depression, and, the, long, depression, deflation, was, present, during, most, economic, depressions, in, us, history, a, deflationary, spiral, is, a, situation, where, decreases, in, the, price, level, lead, to, lower, production, which, in, turn, leads, to, lower, wages, and, demand, which, leads, to, further, decreases, in, the, price, level, since, reductions, in, general, price, level, are, called, deflation, a, deflationary, spiral, occurs, when, reductions, in, price, lead, to, a, vicious, circle, where, a, problem, exacerbates, its, own, cause, in, science, this, effect, is, also, known, as, a, positive, feedback, loop, another, economic, example, of, this, situation, in, economics, is, the, bank, run, the, great, depression, was, regarded, by, some, as, a, deflationary, spiral, a, deflationary, spiral, is, the, modern, macroeconomic, version, of, the, general, glut, controversy, of, the, 19th, century, another, related, idea, is, irving, fisher, s, theory, that, excess, debt, can, cause, a, continuing, deflation, during, severe, deflation, targeting, an, interest, rate, the, usual, method, of, determining, how, much, currency, to, create, may, be, ineffective, because, even, lowering, the, short, term, interest, rate, to, zero, may, result, in, a, real, interest, rate, which, is, too, high, to, attract, credit, worthy, borrowers, in, the, 21st, century, negative, interest, rates, have, been, tried, but, it, cannot, be, too, negative, since, people, might, withdraw, cash, from, bank, accounts, if, they, have, a, negative, interest, rate, thus, the, central, bank, must, directly, set, a, target, for, the, quantity, of, money, called, quantitative, easing, and, may, use, extraordinary, methods, to, increase, the, supply, of, money, e, g, purchasing, financial, assets, of, a, type, not, usually, used, by, the, central, bank, as, reserves, such, as, mortgage, backed, securities, before, he, was, chairman, of, the, united, states, federal, reserve, ben, bernanke, claimed, in, 2002, sufficient, injections, of, money, will, ultimately, always, reverse, a, deflation, although, japan, s, deflationary, spiral, was, not, broken, by, the, amount, of, quantitative, easing, provided, by, the, bank, of, japan, until, the, 1930s, it, was, commonly, believed, by, economists, that, deflation, would, cure, itself, as, prices, decreased, demand, would, naturally, increase, and, the, economic, system, would, correct, itself, without, outside, intervention, this, view, was, challenged, in, the, 1930s, during, the, great, depression, keynesian, economists, argued, that, the, economic, system, was, not, self, correcting, with, respect, to, deflation, and, that, governments, and, central, banks, had, to, take, active, measures, to, boost, demand, through, tax, cuts, or, increases, in, government, spending, reserve, requirements, from, the, central, bank, were, high, compared, to, recent, times, so, were, it, not, for, redemption, of, currency, for, gold, in, accordance, with, the, gold, standard, the, central, bank, could, have, effectively, increased, money, supply, by, simply, reducing, the, reserve, requirements, and, through, open, market, operations, e, g, buying, treasury, bonds, for, cash, to, offset, the, reduction, of, money, supply, in, the, private, sectors, due, to, the, collapse, of, credit, credit, is, a, form, of, money, with, the, rise, of, monetarist, ideas, the, focus, in, fighting, deflation, was, put, on, expanding, demand, by, lowering, interest, rates, i, e, reducing, the, cost, of, money, this, view, has, received, criticism, in, light, of, the, failure, of, accommodative, policies, in, both, japan, and, the, us, to, spur, demand, after, stock, market, shocks, in, the, early, 1990s, and, in, 2000, 2002, respectively, austrian, economists, worry, about, the, inflationary, impact, of, monetary, policies, on, asset, prices, sustained, low, real, rates, can, cause, higher, asset, prices, and, excessive, debt, accumulation, therefore, lowering, rates, may, prove, to, be, only, a, temporary, palliative, aggravating, an, eventual, debt, deflation, crisis, when, the, central, bank, has, lowered, nominal, interest, rates, to, zero, it, can, no, longer, further, stimulate, demand, by, lowering, interest, rates, this, is, the, famous, liquidity, trap, when, deflation, takes, hold, it, requires, special, arrangements, to, lend, money, at, a, zero, nominal, rate, of, interest, which, could, still, be, a, very, high, real, rate, of, interest, due, to, the, negative, inflation, rate, in, order, to, artificially, increase, the, money, supply, although, the, values, of, capital, assets, are, often, casually, said, to, deflate, when, they, decline, this, usage, is, not, consistent, with, the, usual, definition, of, deflation, a, more, accurate, description, for, a, decrease,

1997, hong, kong, experienced, a, long, period, of, deflation, which, did, not, end, until, the, fourth, quarter, of, 2004, many, east, asian, currencies, devalued, following, the, crisis, the, hong, kong, dollar, however, was, pegged, to, the, u, s, dollar, leading, to, an, adjustment, instead, by, a, deflation, of, consumer, prices, the, situation, was, worsened, by, the, increasingly, cheap, exports, from, mainland, china, and, weak, consumer, confidence, in, hong, kong, this, deflation, was, accompanied, by, an, economic, slump, that, was, more, severe, and, prolonged, than, those, of, the, surrounding, countries, that, devalued, their, currencies, in, the, wake, of, the, asian, financial, crisis, in, february, 2009, ireland, s, central, statistics, office, announced, that, during, january, 2009, the, country, experienced, deflation, with, prices, falling, by, 0, 1, from, the, same, time, in, 2008, this, was, the, first, time, deflation, has, hit, the, irish, economy, since, 1960, overall, consumer, prices, decreased, by, 1, 7, in, the, month, brian, lenihan, ireland, s, minister, for, finance, mentioned, deflation, in, an, interview, with, rt, radio, according, to, rt, s, account, minister, for, finance, brian, lenihan, has, said, that, deflation, must, be, taken, into, account, when, budget, cuts, in, child, benefit, public, sector, pay, and, professional, fees, are, being, considered, mr, lenihan, said, month, on, month, there, has, been, a, 6, 6, decline, in, the, cost, of, living, this, year, this, interview, is, notable, in, that, the, deflation, referred, to, is, not, discernibly, regarded, negatively, by, the, minister, in, the, interview, the, minister, mentions, the, deflation, as, an, item, of, data, helpful, to, the, arguments, for, a, cut, in, certain, benefits, the, alleged, economic, harm, caused, by, deflation, is, not, alluded, to, or, mentioned, by, this, member, of, government, this, is, a, notable, example, of, deflation, in, the, modern, era, being, discussed, by, a, senior, financial, minister, without, any, mention, of, how, it, might, be, avoided, or, whether, it, should, be, deflation, started, in, the, early, 1990s, the, bank, of, japan, and, the, government, tried, to, eliminate, it, by, reducing, interest, rates, and, quantitative, easing, but, did, not, create, a, sustained, increase, in, broad, money, and, deflation, persisted, in, july, 2006, the, zero, rate, policy, was, ended, systemic, reasons, for, deflation, in, japan, can, be, said, to, include, in, november, 2009, japan, returned, to, deflation, according, to, the, wall, street, journal, bloomberg, l, p, reports, that, consumer, prices, fell, in, october, 2009, by, a, near, record, 2, 2, it, was, not, until, 2014, that, new, economic, policies, laid, out, by, prime, minister, shinzo, abe, finally, allowed, for, significant, levels, of, inflation, to, return, however, the, covid, 19, recession, once, again, led, to, deflation, in, 2020, with, consumer, good, prices, quickly, falling, prompting, heavy, government, stimulus, worth, over, 20, of, gdp, as, a, result, it, is, likely, that, deflation, will, remain, as, a, long, term, economic, issue, for, japan, during, world, war, i, the, british, pound, sterling, was, removed, from, the, gold, standard, the, motivation, for, this, policy, change, was, to, finance, world, war, i, one, of, the, results, was, inflation, and, a, rise, in, the, gold, price, along, with, the, corresponding, drop, in, international, exchange, rates, for, the, pound, when, the, pound, was, returned, to, the, gold, standard, after, the, war, it, was, done, on, the, basis, of, the, pre, war, gold, price, which, since, it, was, higher, than, equivalent, price, in, gold, required, prices, to, fall, to, realign, with, the, higher, target, value, of, the, pound, the, uk, experienced, deflation, of, approximately, 10, in, 1921, 14, in, 1922, and, 3, to, 5, in, the, early, 1930s, there, have, been, four, significant, periods, of, deflation, in, the, united, states, the, first, and, most, severe, was, during, the, depression, in, 1818, 1821, when, prices, of, agricultural, commodities, declined, by, almost, 50, a, credit, contraction, caused, by, a, financial, crisis, in, england, drained, specie, out, of, the, u, s, the, bank, of, the, united, states, also, contracted, its, lending, the, price, of, agricultural, commodities, fell, by, almost, 50, from, the, high, in, 1815, to, the, low, in, 1821, and, did, not, recover, until, the, late, 1830s, although, to, a, significantly, lower, price, level, most, damaging, was, the, price, of, cotton, the, u, s, s, main, export, food, crop, prices, which, had, been, high, because, of, the, famine, of, 1816, that, was, caused, by, the, year, without, a, summer, fell, after, the, return, of, normal, harvests, in, 1818, improved, transportation, mainly, from, turnpikes, and, to, a, minor, extent, the, introduction, of, steamboats, significantly, lowered, transportation, costs, the, second, was, the, depression, of, the, late, 1830s, to, 1843, following, the, panic, of, 1837, when, the, currency, in, the, united, states, contracted, by, about, 34, with, prices, falling, by, 33, the, magnitude, of, this, contraction, is, only, matched, by, the, great, depression, see, historical, examples, of, credit, deflation, this, deflation, satisfies, both, definitions, that, of, a, decrease, in, prices, and, a, decrease, in, the, available, quantity, of, money, despite, the, deflation, and, depression, gdp, rose, 16, from, 1839, to, 1843, the, third, was, after, the, civil, war, sometimes, called, the, great, deflation, it, was, possibly, spurred, by, return, to, a, gold, standard, retiring, paper, money, printed, during, the, civil, war, the, great, sag, of, 1873, 96, could, be, near, the, top, of, the, list, its, scope, was, global, it, featured, cost, cutting, and, productivity, enhancing, technologies, it, flummoxed, the, experts, with, its, persistence, and, it, resisted, attempts, by, politicians, to, understand, it, let, alone, reverse, it, it, delivered, a, generation, s, worth, of, rising, bond, prices, as, well, as, the, usual, losses, to, unwary, creditors, via, defaults, and, early, calls, between, 1875, and, 1896, according, to, milton, friedman, prices, fell, in, the, united, states, by, 1, 7, a, year, and, in, britain, by, 0, 8, a, year, note, david, a, wells, 1890, gives, an, account, of, the, period, and, discusses, the, great, advances, in, productivity, which, wells, argues, were, the, cause, of, the, deflation, the, productivity, gains, matched, the, deflation, murray, rothbard, 2002, gives, a, similar, account, the, fourth, was, in, 1930, 1933, when, the, rate, of, deflation, was, approximately, 10, percent, year, part, of, the, united, states, slide, into, the, great, depression, where, banks, failed, and, unemployment, peaked, at, 25, the, deflation, of, the, great, depression, occurred, partly, because, there, was, an, enormous, contraction, of, credit, money, bankruptcies, creating, an, environment, where, cash, was, in, frantic, demand, and, when, the, federal, reserve, was, supposed, to, accommodate, that, demand, it, instead, contracted, the, money, supply, by, 30, in, enforcement, of, its, new, real, bills, doctrine, so, banks, failed, one, by, one, because, they, were, unable, to, meet, the, sudden, demand, for, cash, see, bank, run, from, the, standpoint, of, the, fisher, equation, see, above, there, was, a, simultaneous, drop, both, in, money, supply, credit, and, the, velocity, of, money, which, was, so, profound, that, price, deflation, took, hold, despite, the, increases, in, money, supply, spurred, by, the, federal, reserve, throughout, the, history, of, the, united, states, inflation, has, approached, zero, and, dipped, below, for, short, periods, of, time, this, was, quite, common, in, the, 19th, century, and, in, the, 20th, century, until, the, permanent, abandonment, of, the, gold, standard, for, the, bretton, woods, system, in, 1948, in, the, past, 60, years, the, united, states, has, experienced, deflation, only, two, times, in, 2009, with, the, great, recession, and, in, 2015, when, the, cpi, barely, broke, below, 0, at, 0, 1, some, economists, believe, the, united, states, may, have, experienced, deflation, as, part, of, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, compare, the, theory, of, debt, deflation, consumer, prices, dropped, 1, percent, in, october, 2008, this, was, the, largest, one, month, fall, in, prices, in, the, u, s, since, at, least, 1947, that, record, was, again, broken, in, november, 2008, with, a, 1, 7, decline, in, response, the, federal, reserve, decided, to, continue, cutting, interest, rates, down, to, a, near, zero, range, as, of, december, 16, 2008, in, late, 2008, and, early, 2009, some, economists, feared, the, u, s, would, enter, a, deflationary, spiral, economist, nouriel, roubini, predicted, that, the, united, states, would, enter, a, deflationary, recession, and, coined, the, term, stag, deflation, to, describe, it, it, was, the, opposite, of, stagflation, which, was, the, main, fear, during, the, spring, and, summer, of, 2008, the, united, states, then, began, experiencing, measurable, deflation, steadily, decreasing, from, the, first, measured, deflation, of, 0, 38, in, march, to, july, s, deflation, rate, of, 2, 10, on, the, wage, front, in, october, 2009, the, state, of, colorado, announced, that, its, state, minimum, wage, which, was, indexed, to, inflation, was, set, to, be, cut, which, would, be, the, first, time, a, state, had, cut, its, minimum, wage, since, 1938
