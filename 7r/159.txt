secular, celebration, for, others, some, christians, historically, abstained, from, meat, on, all, hallows, eve, a, tradition, reflected, in, the, eating, of, certain, vegetarian, foods, on, this,

and, is, contracted, to, e, en, or, een, all, hallow, s, e, v, en, became, hallowe, en, halloween, is, thought, to, have, influences, from, christian, beliefs, and, practices, the, english, word, halloween, comes, from, all, hallows, eve, being, the, evening, before, the, christian, holy, days, of, all, hallows, day, all, saints, day, on, 1, november, and, all, souls, day, on, 2, november, since, the, time, of, the, early, church, major, feasts, in, christianity, such, as, christmas, easter, and, pentecost, had, vigils, that, began, the, night, before, as, did, the, feast, of, all, hallows, these, three, days, are, collectively, called, allhallowtide, and, are, a, time, when, western, christians, honour, all, saints, and, pray, for, recently, departed, souls, who, have, yet, to, reach, heaven, commemorations, of, all, saints, and, martyrs, were, held, by, several, churches, on, various, dates, mostly, in, springtime, in, 4th, century, roman, edessa, it, was, held, on, 13, may, and, on, 13, may, 609, pope, boniface, iv, re, dedicated, the, pantheon, in, rome, to, st, mary, and, all, martyrs, this, was, the, date, of, lemuria, an, ancient, roman, festival, of, the, dead, in, the, 8th, century, pope, gregory, iii, 731, 741, founded, an, oratory, in, st, peter, s, for, the, relics, of, the, holy, apostles, and, of, all, saints, martyrs, and, confessors, some, sources, say, it, was, dedicated, on, 1, november, while, others, say, it, was, on, palm, sunday, in, april, 732, by, 800, there, is, evidence, that, churches, in, ireland, and, northumbria, were, holding, a, feast, commemorating, all, saints, on, 1, november, alcuin, of, northumbria, a, member, of, charlemagne, s, court, may, then, have, introduced, this, 1, november, date, in, the, frankish, empire, in, 835, it, became, the, official, date, in, the, frankish, empire, some, suggest, this, was, due, to, celtic, influence, while, others, suggest, it, was, a, germanic, idea, although, it, is, claimed, that, both, germanic, and, celtic, speaking, peoples, commemorated, the, dead, at, the, beginning, of, winter, they, may, have, seen, it, as, the, most, fitting, time, to, do, so, as, it, is, a, time, of, dying, in, nature, it, is, also, suggested, the, change, was, made, on, the, practical, grounds, that, rome, in, summer, could, not, accommodate, the, great, number, of, pilgrims, who, flocked, to, it, and, perhaps, because, of, public, health, concerns, over, roman, fever, which, claimed, a, number, of, lives, during, rome, s, sultry, summers, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, the, celebration, had, become, known, as, the, holy, days, of, obligation, in, western, christianity, and, involved, such, traditions, as, ringing, church, bells, for, souls, in, purgatory, it, was, also, customary, for, criers, dressed, in, black, to, parade, the, streets, ringing, a, bell, of, mournful, sound, and, calling, on, all, good, christians, to, remember, the, poor, souls, the, allhallowtide, custom, of, baking, and, sharing, soul, cakes, for, all, christened, souls, has, been, suggested, as, the, origin, of, trick, or, treating, the, custom, dates, back, at, least, as, far, as, the, 15th, century, and, was, found, in, parts, of, england, wales, flanders, bavaria, and, austria, groups, of, poor, people, often, children, would, go, door, to, door, during, allhallowtide, collecting, soul, cakes, in, exchange, for, praying, for, the, dead, especially, the, souls, of, the, givers, friends, and, relatives, this, was, called, souling, soul, cakes, were, also, offered, for, the, souls, themselves, to, eat, or, the, soulers, would, act, as, their, representatives, as, with, the, lenten, tradition, of, hot, cross, buns, soul, cakes, were, often, marked, with, a, cross, indicating, they, were, baked, as, alms, shakespeare, mentions, souling, in, his, comedy, the, two, gentlemen, of, verona, 1593, while, souling, christians, would, carry, lanterns, made, of, hollowed, out, turnips, which, could, have, originally, represented, souls, of, the, dead, jack, o, lanterns, were, used, to, ward, off, evil, spirits, on, all, saints, and, all, souls, day, during, the, 19th, century, candles, were, lit, in, homes, in, ireland, flanders, bavaria, and, in, tyrol, where, they, were, called, soul, lights, that, served, to, guide, the, souls, back, to, visit, their, earthly, homes, in, many, of, these, places, candles, were, also, lit, at, graves, on, all, souls, day, in, brittany, libations, of, milk, were, poured, on, the, graves, of, kinfolk, or, food, would, be, left, overnight, on, the, dinner, table, for, the, returning, souls, a, custom, also, found, in, tyrol, and, parts, of, italy, christian, minister, prince, sorie, conteh, linked, the, wearing, of, costumes, to, the, belief, in, vengeful, ghosts, it, was, traditionally, believed, that, the, souls, of, the, departed, wandered, the, earth, until, all, saints, day, and, all, hallows, eve, provided, one, last, chance, for, the, dead, to, gain, vengeance, on, their, enemies, before, moving, to, the, next, world, in, order, to, avoid, being, recognized, by, any, soul, that, might, be, seeking, such, vengeance, people, would, don, masks, or, costumes, in, the, middle, ages, churches, in, europe, that, were, too, poor, to, display, relics, of, martyred, saints, at, allhallowtide, let, parishioners, dress, up, as, saints, instead, some, christians, observe, this, custom, at, halloween, today, lesley, bannatyne, believes, this, could, have, been, a, christianization, of, an, earlier, pagan, custom, many, christians, in, mainland, europe, especially, in, france, believed, that, once, a, year, on, hallowe, en, the, dead, of, the, churchyards, rose, for, one, wild, hideous, carnival, known, as, the, danse, macabre, which, was, often, depicted, in, church, decoration, christopher, allmand, and, rosamond, mckitterick, write, in, the, new, cambridge, medieval, history, that, the, danse, macabre, urged, christians, not, to, forget, the, end, of, all, earthly, things, the, danse, macabre, was, sometimes, enacted, in, european, village, pageants, and, court, masques, with, people, dressing, up, as, corpses, from, various, strata, of, society, and, this, may, be, the, origin, of, halloween, costume, parties, in, britain, these, customs, came, under, attack, during, the, reformation, as, protestants, berated, purgatory, as, a, popish, doctrine, incompatible, with, the, calvinist, doctrine, of, predestination, state, sanctioned, ceremonies, associated, with, the, intercession, of, saints, and, prayer, for, souls, in, purgatory, were, abolished, during, the, elizabethan, reform, though, all, hallow, s, day, remained, in, the, english, liturgical, calendar, to, commemorate, saints, as, godly, human, beings, for, some, nonconformist, protestants, the, theology, of, all, hallows, eve, was, redefined, souls, cannot, be, journeying, from, purgatory, on, their, way, to, heaven, as, catholics, frequently, believe, and, assert, instead, the, so, called, ghosts, are, thought, to, be, in, actuality, evil, spirits, other, protestants, believed, in, an, intermediate, state, known, as, hades, bosom, of, abraham, in, some, localities, catholics, and, protestants, continued, souling, candlelit, processions, or, ringing, church, bells, for, the, dead, the, anglican, church, eventually, suppressed, this, bell, ringing, mark, donnelly, a, professor, of, medieval, archaeology, and, historian, daniel, diehl, write, that, barns, and, homes, were, blessed, to, protect, people, and, livestock, from, the, effect, of, witches, who, were, believed, to, accompany, the, malignant, spirits, as, they, traveled, the, earth, after, 1605, hallowtide, was, eclipsed, in, england, by, guy, fawkes, night, 5, november, which, appropriated, some, of, its, customs, in, england, the, ending, of, official, ceremonies, related, to, the, intercession, of, saints, led, to, the, development, of, new, unofficial, hallowtide, customs, in, 18th, 19th, century, rural, lancashire, catholic, families, gathered, on, hills, on, the, night, of, all, hallows, eve, one, held, a, bunch, of, burning, straw, on, a, pitchfork, while, the, rest, knelt, around, him, praying, for, the, souls, of, relatives, and, friends, until, the, flames, went, out, this, was, known, as, teen, lay, there, was, a, similar, custom, in, hertfordshire, and, the, lighting, of, tindle, fires, in, derbyshire, some, suggested, these, tindles, were, originally, lit, to, guide, the, poor, souls, back, to, earth, in, scotland, and, ireland, old, allhallowtide, customs, that, were, at, odds, with, reformed, teaching, were, not, suppressed, as, they, were, important, to, the, life, cycle, and, rites, of, passage, of, local, communities, and, curbing, them, would, have, been, difficult, in, parts, of, italy, until, the, 15th, century, families, left, a, meal, out, for, the, ghosts, of,

vigil, in, 19th, century, san, sebasti, n, there, was, a, procession, to, the, city, cemetery, at, allhallowtide, an, event, that, drew, beggars, who, appeal, to, the, tender, recollections, of, one, s, deceased, relations, and, friends, for, sympathy, today, s, halloween, customs, are, thought, to, have, been, influenced, by, folk, customs, and, beliefs, from, the, celtic, speaking, countries, some, of, which, are, believed, to, have, pagan, roots, jack, santino, a, folklorist, writes, that, there, was, throughout, ireland, an, uneasy, truce, existing, between, customs, and, beliefs, associated, with, christianity, and, those, associated, with, religions, that, were, irish, before, christianity, arrived, the, origins, of, halloween, customs, are, typically, linked, to, the, gaelic, festival, samhain, samhain, is, one, of, the, quarter, days, in, the, medieval, gaelic, calendar, and, has, been, celebrated, on, 31, october, 1, november, in, ireland, scotland, and, the,

day, of, winter, for, the, celts, the, day, ended, and, began, at, sunset, thus, the, festival, begins, the, evening, before, 1, november, by, modern, reckoning, samhain, is, mentioned, in, some, of, the, earliest, irish, literature, the, names, have, been, used, by, historians, to, refer, to, celtic, halloween, customs, up, until, the, 19th, century, and, are, still, the, gaelic, and, welsh,

see, them, as, degraded, versions, of, ancient, gods, whose, power, remained, active, in, the, people, s, minds, even, after, they, had, been, officially, replaced, by, later, religious, beliefs, they, were, both, respected, and, feared, with, individuals, often, invoking, the, protection, of, god, when, approaching, their, dwellings, at, samhain, the, aos, s, were, appeased, to, ensure, the,

on, halloween, night, candles, that, had, been, blessed, were, placed, on, graves, and, families, sometimes, spent, the, entire, night, at, the, graveside, originally, confined, to, these, immigrant, communities, it, was, gradually, assimilated, into, mainstream, society, and, was, celebrated, coast, to, coast, by, people, of, all, social, racial, and, religious, backgrounds, by, the, early, 20th, century, then, through, american, influence, these, halloween, traditions, spread, to, many, other, countries, by, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, including, to, mainland, europe, and,

hallows, eve, in, order, to, frighten, evil, spirits, there, is, a, popular, irish, christian, folktale, associated, with, the, jack, o, lantern, which, in, folklore, is, said, to, represent, a, soul, who, has, been, denied, entry, into, both, heaven, and, hell, on, route, home, after, a, night, s, drinking, jack, encounters, the, devil, and, tricks, him, into, climbing, a, tree, a, quick, thinking, jack, etches, the, sign, of, the, cross, into, the, bark, thus, trapping, the, devil, jack, strikes, a, bargain, that, satan, can, never, claim, his, soul, after, a, life, of, sin, drink, and, mendacity, jack, is, refused, entry, to, heaven, when, he, dies, keeping, his, promise, the, devil, refuses, to, let, jack, into, hell, and, throws, a, live, coal, straight, from, the, fires, of, hell, at, him, it, was, a, cold, night, so, jack, places, the, coal, in, a, hollowed, out, turnip, to, stop, it, from, going, out, since, which, time, jack, and, his, lantern, have, been, roaming, looking, for, a, place, to, rest, in, ireland, scotland, and, northern, england, the, turnip, has, traditionally, been, carved, during, halloween, but, immigrants, to, north, america, used, the, native, pumpkin, which, is, both, much, softer, and, much, larger, making, it, easier, to, carve, than, a, turnip, the, american, tradition, of, carving, pumpkins, is, recorded, in, 1837, and, was, originally, associated, with, harvest, time, in, general, not, becoming, specifically, associated, with, halloween, until, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, the, modern, imagery, of, halloween, comes, from, many, sources, including, christian, eschatology, national, customs, works, of, gothic, and, horror, literature, such, as, the, novels, frankenstein, or, the, modern, prometheus, and, dracula, and, classic, horror, films, such, as, frankenstein, 1931, and, the, mummy, 1932, imagery, of, the, skull, a, reference, to, golgotha, in, the, christian, tradition, serves, as, a, reminder, of, death, and, the, transitory, quality, of, human, life, and, is, consequently, found, in, memento, mori, and, vanitas, compositions, skulls, have, therefore, been, commonplace, in, halloween, which, touches, on, this, theme, traditionally, the, back, walls, of, churches, are, decorated, with, a, depiction, of, the, last, judgment, complete, with, graves, opening, and, the, dead, rising, with, a, heaven, filled, with, angels, and, a, hell, filled, with, devils, a, motif, that, has, permeated, the, observance, of, this, triduum, one, of, the, earliest, works, on, the, subject, of, halloween, is, from, scottish, poet, john, mayne, who, in, 1780, made, note, of, pranks, at, halloween, what, fearfu, pranks, ensue, as, well, as, the, supernatural, associated, with, the, night, bogles, ghosts, influencing, robert, burns, halloween, 1785, elements, of, the, autumn, season, such, as, pumpkins, corn, husks, and, scarecrows, are, also, prevalent, homes, are, often, decorated, with, these, types, of, symbols, around, halloween, halloween, imagery, includes, themes, of, death, evil, and, mythical, monsters, black, cats, which, have, been, long, associated, with, witches,

to, perform, mischief, on, the, homeowners, or, their, property, if, no, treat, is, given, the, practice, is, said, to, have, roots, in, the, medieval, practice, of, mumming, which, is, closely, related, to, souling, john, pymm, wrote, that, many, of, the, feast, days, associated, with, the, presentation, of, mumming, plays, were, celebrated, by, the, christian, church, these, feast, days, included, all, hallows, eve, christmas, twelfth, night, and, shrove, tuesday, mumming, practiced, in, germany, scandinavia, and, other, parts, of, europe, involved, masked, persons, in, fancy, dress, who, paraded, the, streets, and, entered, houses, to, dance, or, play, dice, in, silence, in, england, from, the, medieval, period, up, until, the, 1930s, people, practiced, the, christian, custom,

the, united, states, are, borrowed, directly, or, adapted, from, those, of, other, countries, while, the, first, reference, to, guising, in, north, america, occurs, in, 1911, another, reference, to,

1934, and, the, first, use, in, a, national, publication, occurring, in, 1939, a, popular, variant, of, trick, or, treating, known, as, trunk, or, treating, or, halloween, tailgating, occurs, when, children, are, offered, treats, from, the, trunks, of, cars, parked, in, a, church, parking, lot, or, sometimes, a, school, parking, lot, in, a, trunk, or, treat, event, the, trunk, boot, of, each, automobile, is, decorated, with, a, certain, theme, such, as, those, of, children, s, literature, movies, scripture, and, job, roles, trunk, or, treating, has, grown, in, popularity, due, to, its, perception, as, being, more, safe, than, going, door, to, door, a, point, that, resonates, well, with, parents, as, well, as, the, fact, that, it, solves, the, rural, conundrum, in, which, homes, built, a, half, mile, apart, halloween, costumes, were, traditionally, modeled, after, figures, such, as, vampires, ghosts, skeletons, scary, looking, witches, and, devils, over, time, the, costume, selection, extended, to, include, popular, characters, from, fiction, celebrities, and, generic, archetypes, such, as, ninjas, and, princesses, dressing, up, in, costumes, and, going, guising, was, prevalent, in, scotland, and, ireland, at, halloween, by, the, late, 19th, century, a, scottish, term, the, tradition, is, called, guising, because, of, the, disguises, or, costumes, worn, by, the, children, in, ireland, and, scotland, the, masks, are, known, as, false, faces, a, term, recorded, in, ayr, scotland, in, 1890, by, a, scot, describing, guisers, i, had, mind, it, was, halloween, the,

popular, for, halloween, parties, in, the, us, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, often, for, adults, as, for, children, and, when, trick, or, treating, was, becoming, popular, in, canada, and, the, us, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, eddie, j, smith, in, his, book, halloween, hallowed, is, thy, name, offers, a, religious, perspective, to, the, wearing, of, costumes, on, all, hallows, eve, suggesting, that, by, dressing, up, as, creatures, who, at, one, time, caused, us, to, fear, and, tremble, people, are, able, to, poke, fun, at, satan, whose, kingdom, has, been, plundered, by, our, saviour, images, of, skeletons, and, the, dead, are, traditional, decorations, used, as, memento, mori, trick, or, treat, for, unicef, is, a, fundraising, program, to, support, unicef, a, united,

nationally, in, 1952, the, program, involves, the, distribution, of, small, boxes, by, schools, or, in, modern, times, corporate, sponsors, like, hallmark, at, their, licensed, stores, to, trick, or, treaters, in, which, they, can, solicit, small, change, donations, from, the, houses, they, visit, it, is, estimated, that, children, have, collected, more, than, 118, million, for, unicef, since, its, inception, in, canada, in, 2006, unicef, decided, to, discontinue, their, halloween, collection, boxes, citing, safety, and, administrative, concerns, after, consultation, with, schools, they, instead, redesigned, the, program, the, yearly, new, york, s, village, halloween, parade, was, begun, in, 1974, it, is, the, world, s, largest, halloween, parade, and, america, s, only, major, nighttime, parade, attracting, more, than, 60, 000, costumed, participants, two, million, spectators, and, a, worldwide, television, audience, since, the, late, 2010s, ethnic, stereotypes, as, costumes, have, increasingly, come, under, scrutiny, in, the, united, states, according, to, a, 2018, report, from, the, national, retail, federation, 30, million, americans, will, spend, an, estimated, 480, million, on, halloween, costumes, for, their, pets, in, 2018, this, is, up, from, an, estimated, 200, million, in, 2010, the, most, popular, costumes, for, pets, are, the, pumpkin, followed, by, the, hot, dog, and, the, bumblebee, in, third, place, there, are, several, games, traditionally, associated, with, halloween, some, of, these, games, originated, as, divination, rituals, or, ways, of, foretelling, one, s, future, especially, regarding, death, marriage, and, children, during, the, middle, ages, these, rituals, were, done, by, a, rare, few, in, rural, communities, as, they, were, considered, to, be, deadly, serious, practices, in, recent, centuries, these, divination, games, have, been, a, common, feature, of, the, household, festivities, in, ireland, and, britain, they, often, involve, apples, and, hazelnuts, in, celtic, mythology, apples, were, strongly, associated, with, the, otherworld, and, immortality, while, hazelnuts, were, associated, with, divine, wisdom, some, also, suggest, that, they, derive, from, roman, practices, in, celebration, of, pomona, the, following, activities, were, a, common, feature, of, halloween, in, ireland, and, britain, during, the, 17th, 20th, centuries, some, have, become, more, widespread, and, continue, to, be, popular, today, one, common, game, is, apple, bobbing, or, dunking, which, may, be, called, dooking, in, scotland, in, which, apples, float, in, a, tub, or, a, large, basin, of, water, and, the, participants, must, use, only, their, teeth, to, remove, an, apple, from, the, basin, a, variant, of, dunking, involves, kneeling, on, a, chair, holding, a, fork, between, the, teeth, and, trying, to, drive, the, fork, into, an, apple, another, common, game, involves, hanging, up, treacle, or, syrup, coated, scones, by, strings, these, must, be, eaten, without, using, hands, while, they, remain, attached, to, the, string, an, activity, that, inevitably, leads, to, a, sticky, face, another, once, popular, game, involves, hanging, a, small, wooden, rod, from, the, ceiling, at, head, height, with, a, lit, candle, on, one, end, and, an, apple, hanging, from, the, other, the, rod, is, spun, round, and, everyone, takes, turns, to, try, to, catch, the, apple, with, their, teeth, several, of, the, traditional, activities, from, ireland, and, britain, involve, foretelling, one, s, future, partner, or, spouse, an, apple, would, be, peeled, in, one, long, strip, then, the, peel, tossed, over, the, shoulder, the, peel, is, believed, to, land, in, the, shape, of, the, first, letter, of, the, future, spouse, s, name, two, hazelnuts, would, be, roasted, near, a, fire, one, named, for, the, person, roasting, them, and, the, other, for, the, person, they, desire, if, the, nuts, jump, away, from, the, heat, it, is, a, bad, sign, but, if, the, nuts, roast, quietly, it, foretells, a, good, match, a, salty, oatmeal, bannock, would, be, baked, the, person, would, eat, it, in, three, bites, and, then, go, to, bed, in, silence, without, anything, to, drink, this, is, said, to, result, in, a, dream, in, which, their, future, spouse, offers, them, a, drink, to, quench, their, thirst, unmarried, women, were, told, that, if, they, sat, in, a, darkened, room, and, gazed, into, a, mirror, on, halloween, night, the, face, of, their, future, husband, would, appear, in, the, mirror, the, custom, was, widespread, enough, to, be, commemorated, on, greeting, cards, from, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, another, popular, irish, game, was, known, as, p, ic, n, blindfolds, a, person, would, be, blindfolded, and, then, would, choose, between, several, saucers, the, item, in, the, saucer, would, provide, a, hint, as, to, their, future, a, ring, would, mean,

include, haunted, houses, corn, mazes, and, hayrides, and, the, level, of, sophistication, of, the, effects, has, risen, as, the, industry, has, grown, the, first, recorded, purpose, built, haunted, attraction, was, the, orton, and, spooner, ghost, house, which, opened, in, 1915, in, liphook, england, this, attraction, actually, most, closely, resembles, a, carnival, fun, house, powered, by, steam, the, house, still, exists, in, the, hollycombe, steam, collection, it, was, during, the, 1930s, about, the, same, time, as, trick, or, treating, that, halloween, themed, haunted, houses, first,

of, dimes, copyrighted, a, mini, haunted, house, for, the, march, of, dimes, in, 1976, and, began, fundraising, through, their, local, chapters, by, conducting, haunted, houses, soon, after, although, they, apparently, quit, supporting, this, type, of, event, nationally, sometime, in, the, 1980s, some, march, of, dimes, haunted, houses, have, persisted, until, today, on, the, evening, of, 11, may,

but, the, practice, rapidly, waned, in, the, wake, of, widespread, rumors, that, some, individuals, were, embedding, items, like, pins, and, razor, blades, in, the, apples, in, the, united, states, while, there, is, evidence, of, such, incidents, relative, to, the, degree, of, reporting, of, such, cases, actual, cases, involving, malicious, acts, are, extremely, rare, and, have, never, resulted, in, serious, injury, nonetheless, many, parents, assumed, that, such, heinous, practices, were, rampant, because, of, the, mass, media, at, the, peak, of, the, hysteria, some, hospitals, offered, free, x, rays, of, children, s, halloween, hauls, in, order, to, find, evidence, of, tampering, virtually, all, of, the, few, known, candy, poisoning, incidents, involved, parents, who, poisoned, their, own, children, s, candy, one, custom, that, persists, in, modern, day, ireland, is, the, baking, or, more, often, nowadays, the, purchase, of, a, barmbrack, irish, b, ir, n, breac, which, is, a, light, fruitcake, into, which, a, plain, ring, a, coin, and, other, charms, are, placed, before, baking, it, is, considered, fortunate, to, be, the, lucky, one, who, finds, it, it, has, also, been, said, that, those, who, get, a, ring, will, find, their, true, love, in, the, ensuing, year, this, is, similar, to, the, tradition, of, king, cake, at, the, festival, of, epiphany, halloween, themed, foods, are, also, produced, by, companies, in, the, lead, up, to, the, night, for, example, cadbury, releasing, goo, heads, similar, to, creme, eggs, in, spooky, wrapping, foods, such, as, cakes,

hallows, eve, in, ireland, and, among, immigrants, in, canada, a, custom, includes, the, christian, practice, of, abstinence, keeping, all, hallows, eve, as, a, meat, free, day, and, serving,

spread, the, vigil, of, all, hallows, throughout, christendom, after, the, service, suitable, festivities, and, entertainments, often, follow, as, well, as, a, visit, to, the, graveyard, or, cemetery, where, flowers, and, candles, are, often, placed, in, preparation, for, all, hallows, day, in, england, light, parties, are, organized, by, churches, after, worship, services, on, halloween, with, the, focus, on, jesus, as, the, light, of, the, world, in, finland, because, so, many, people, visit, the, cemeteries, on, all, hallows, eve, to, light, votive, candles, there, they, are, known, as, valomeri, or, seas, of, light, today, christian, attitudes, towards, halloween, are, diverse, in, the, anglican, church, some, dioceses, have, chosen, to, emphasize, the, christian, traditions, associated, with, all, hallow, s, eve, some, of, these, practices, include, praying, fasting, and, attending, worship, services, o, lord, our, god, increase, we, pray, thee, and, multiply, upon, us,

or, independently, from, it, this, is, because, martin, luther, is, said, to, have, nailed, his, ninety, five, theses, to, all, saints, church, in, wittenberg, on, all, hallows, eve, often, harvest, festivals, or, reformation, festivals, are, held, on, all, hallows, eve, in, which, children, dress, up, as, bible, characters, or, reformers, in, addition, to, distributing, candy, to, children, who, are, trick, or, treating, on, hallowe, en, many, christians, also, provide, gospel, tracts, to, them, one, organization, the, american, tract, society, stated, that, around, 3, million, gospel, tracts, are, ordered, from, them, alone, for, hallowe, en, celebrations, others, order, halloween, themed, scripture, candy, to, pass, out, to, children, on, this, day, some, christians, feel, concerned, about, the, modern, celebration, of, halloween, because, they, feel, it, trivializes, or, celebrates, paganism, the, occult, or, other, practices, and, cultural, phenomena, deemed, incompatible, with, their, beliefs, father, gabriele, amorth, an, exorcist, in, rome, has, said, if, english, and, american, children, like, to, dress, up, as, witches, and, devils, on, one, night, of, the, year, that, is, not, a, problem, if, it, is, just, a, game, there, is, no, harm, in, that, in, more, recent, years, the, roman, catholic, archdiocese, of, boston, has, organized, a, saint, fest, on, halloween, similarly, many, contemporary, protestant, churches, view, halloween, as, a, fun, event, for, children, holding, events, in, their, churches, where, children, and, their, parents, can, dress, up, play, games, and, get, candy, for, free, to, these, christians, halloween, holds, no, threat, to, the, spiritual, lives, of, children, being, taught, about, death, and, mortality, and, the, ways, of, the, celtic, ancestors, actually, being, a, valuable, life, lesson, and, a, part, of, many, of, their, parishioners, heritage, christian, minister, sam, portaro, wrote, that, halloween, is, about, using, humor, and, ridicule, to, confront, the, power, of, death, in, the, roman, catholic, church, halloween, s, christian, connection, is, acknowledged, and, halloween, celebrations, are, common, in, many, catholic, parochial, schools, such, as, in, the, united, states, while, schools, throughout, ireland, also, close, for, the, halloween, break, many, fundamentalist, and, evangelical, churches, use, hell, houses, and, comic, style, tracts, in, order, to, make, use, of, halloween, s, popularity, as, an, opportunity, for, evangelism, others, consider, halloween, to, be, completely, incompatible, with, the, christian, faith, due, to, its, putative, origins, in, the, festival, of, the, dead, celebration, indeed, even, though, eastern, orthodox, christians, observe, all, hallows, day, on, the, first, sunday, after, pentecost, the, eastern, orthodox, church, recommends, the, observance, of, vespers, or, a, paraklesis, on, the, western, observance, of, all, hallows, eve, out, of, the, pastoral, need, to, provide, an, alternative, to, popular, celebrations, according, to, alfred, j, kolatch, in, the, second, jewish, book, of, why, in, judaism, halloween, is, not, permitted, by, jewish, halakha, because, it, violates, leviticus, 18, 3, which, forbids, jews, from, partaking, in, gentile, customs, many, jews, observe, yizkor, communally, four, times, a, year, which, is, vaguely, similar, to, the, observance, of, allhallowtide, in, christianity, in, the, sense, that, prayers, are, said, for, both, martyrs, and, for, one, s, own, family, nevertheless, many, american, jews, celebrate, halloween, disconnected, from, its, christian, origins, reform, rabbi, jeffrey, goldwasser, has, said, that, there, is, no, religious, reason, why, contemporary, jews, should, not, celebrate, halloween, while, orthodox, rabbi, michael, broyde, has, argued, against, jews, observing, the, holiday, purim, has, sometimes, been, compared, to, halloween, in, part, due, to, some, observants, wearing, costumes, especially, of, biblical, figures, described, in, the, purim, narrative, sheikh, idris, palmer, author, of, a, brief, illustrated, guide, to, understanding, islam, has, ruled, that, muslims, should, not, participate, in, halloween, stating, that, participation, in, halloween, is, worse, than, participation, in, christmas, easter, it, is, more, sinful, than,
