in, modern, politics, and, history, a, parliament, is, a, legislative, body, of, government, generally, a, modern, parliament, has, three, functions, representing, the, electorate, making, laws, and, overseeing, the, government, via, hearings, and, inquiries, the, term, is, similar, to, the, idea, of, a, senate, synod, or, congress, and, is, commonly, used, in, countries, that, are, current, or, former, monarchies, some, contexts, restrict, the, use, of, the, word, parliament, to, parliamentary, systems, although, it, is, also, used, to, describe, the, legislature, in, some, presidential, systems, e, g, the, parliament, of, ghana, even, where, it, is, not, in, the, official, name, historically, parliaments, included, various, kinds, of, deliberative, consultative, and, judicial, assemblies, what, is, considered, to, be, the, first, modern, parliament, was, the, cortes, of, le, n, held, in, the, kingdom, of, le, n, in, 1188, according, to, the, unesco, the, decreta, of, leon, of, 1188, is, the, oldest, documentary, manifestation, of, the, european, parliamentary, system, in, addition, unesco, granted, the, 1188, cortes, of, alfonso, ix, the, title, of, memory, of, the, world, and, the, city, of, leon, has, been, recognized, as, the, cradle, of, parliamentarism, the, english, term, is, derived, from, anglo, norman, and, dates, to, the, 14th, century, coming, from, the, 11th, century, old, french, word, parlement, discussion, discourse, from, parler, to, talk, the, meaning, evolved, over, time, originally, referring, to, any, discussion, conversation, or, negotiation, through, various, kinds, of, deliberative, or, judicial, groups, often, summoned, by, a, monarch, by, the, 15th, century, in, britain, it, had, come, to, specifically, mean, the, legislature, since, ancient, times, when, societies, were, tribal, there, were, councils, or, a, headman, whose, decisions, were, assessed, by, village, elders, this, is, called, tribalism, some, scholars, suggest, that, in, ancient, mesopotamia, there, was, a, primitive, democratic, government, where, the, kings, were, assessed, by, council, the, same, has, been, said, about, ancient, india, where, some, form, of, deliberative, assemblies, existed, and, therefore, there, was, some, form, of, democracy, however, these, claims, are, not, accepted, by, other, scholars, who, see, these, forms, of, government, as, oligarchies, ancient, athens, was, the, cradle, of, democracy, the, athenian, assembly, ekklesia, was, the, most, important, institution, and, every, free, male, citizen, could, take, part, in, the, discussions, slaves, and, women, could, not, however, athenian, democracy, was, not, representative, but, rather, direct, and, therefore, the, ekklesia, was, different, from, the, parliamentary, system, the, roman, republic, had, legislative, assemblies, who, had, the, final, say, regarding, the, election, of, magistrates, the, enactment, of, new, statutes, the, carrying, out, of, capital, punishment, the, declaration, of, war, and, peace, and, the, creation, or, dissolution, of, alliances, the, roman, senate, controlled, money, administration, and, the, details, of, foreign, policy, some, muslim, scholars, argue, that, the, islamic, shura, a, method, of, taking, decisions, in, islamic, societies, is, analogous, to, the, parliament, however, other, scholars, notably, from, hizb, ut, tahrir, highlight, what, they, consider, fundamental, differences, between, the, shura, system, and, the, parliamentary, system, england, has, long, had, a, tradition, of, a, body, of, men, who, would, assist, and, advise, the, king, on, important, matters, under, the, anglo, saxon, kings, there, was, an, advisory, council, the, witenagemot, the, name, derives, from, the, old, english, itena, em, t, or, witena, gem, t, for, meeting, of, wise, men, the, first, recorded, act, of, a, witenagemot, was, the, law, code, issued, by, king, thelberht, of, kent, around, 600, the, earliest, document, which, survives, in, sustained, old, english, prose, however, the, witan, was, certainly, in, existence, long, before, then, the, witan, along, with, the, folkmoots, local, assemblies, is, an, important, ancestor, of, the, modern, english, parliament, as, part, of, the, norman, conquest, the, new, king, william, i, did, away, with, the, witenagemot, replacing, it, with, a, curia, regis, king, s, council, membership, of, the, curia, was, largely, restricted, to, the, tenants, in, chief, the, few, nobles, who, rented, great, estates, directly, from, the, king, along, with, ecclesiastics, william, brought, to, england, the, feudal, system, of, his, native, normandy, and, sought, the, advice, of, the, curia, regis, before, making, laws, this, is, the, original, body, from, which, the, parliament, the, higher, courts, of, law, and, the, privy, council, and, cabinet, descend, of, these, the, legislature, is, formally, the, high, court, of, parliament, judges, sit, in, the, supreme, court, of, judicature, only, the, executive, government, is, no, longer, conducted, in, a, royal, court, most, historians, date, the, emergence, of, a, parliament, with, some, degree, of, power, to, which, the, throne, had, to, defer, no, later, than, the, reign, of, edward, i, like, previous, kings, edward, called, leading, nobles, and, church, leaders, to, discuss, government, matters, especially, finance, and, taxation, a, meeting, in, 1295, became, known, as, the, model, parliament, because, it, set, the, pattern, for, later, parliaments, the, significant, difference, between, the, model, parliament, and, the, earlier, curia, regis, was, the, addition, of, the, commons, that, is, the, inclusion, of, elected, representatives, of, rural, landowners, and, of, townsmen, in, 1307, edward, agreed, not, to, collect, certain, taxes, without, the, consent, of, the, realm, through, parliament, he, also, enlarged, the, court, system, the, tenants, in, chief, often, struggled, for, power, with, the, ecclesiastics, and, the, king, in, 1215, they, secured, magna, carta, from, king, john, of, england, this, established, that, the, king, may, not, levy, or, collect, any, taxes, except, the, feudal, taxes, to, which, they, were, hitherto, accustomed, save, with, the, consent, of, a, council, it, was, also, established, that, the, most, important, tenants, in, chief, and, ecclesiastics, be, summoned, to, the, council, by, personal, writs, from, the, sovereign, and, that, all, others, be, summoned, to, the, council, by, general, writs, from, the, sheriffs, of, their, counties, modern, government, has, its, origins, in, the, curia, regis, parliament, descends, from, the, great, council, later, known, as, the, parliamentum, established, by, magna, carta, during, the, reign, of, king, henry, iii, 13th, century, english, parliaments, included, elected, representatives, from, shires, and, towns, thus, these, parliaments, are, considered, forerunners, of, the, modern, parliament, in, 1265, simon, de, montfort, then, in, rebellion, against, henry, iii, summoned, a, parliament, of, his, supporters, without, royal, authorisation, the, archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and, barons, were, summoned, as, were, two, knights, from, each, shire, and, two, burgesses, from, each, borough, knights, had, been, summoned, to, previous, councils, but, it, was, unprecedented, for, the, boroughs, to, be, represented, in, 1295, edward, i, adopted, de, montfort, s, ideas, for, representation, and, election, in, the, so, called, model, parliament, at, first, each, estate, debated, independently, by, the, reign, of, edward, iii, however, parliament, had, grown, closer, to, its, modern, form, with, the, legislative, body, having, two, separate, chambers, the, purpose, and, structure, of, parliament, in, tudor, england, underwent, a, significant, transformation, under, the, reign, of, henry, viii, originally, its, methods, were, primarily, medieval, and, the, monarch, still, possessed, a, form, of, inarguable, dominion, over, its, decisions, according, to, elton, it, was, thomas, cromwell, 1st, earl, of, essex, then, chief, minister, to, henry, viii, who, initiated, still, other, changes, within, parliament, the, acts, of, supremacy, established, the, monarch, as, head, of, the, church, of, england, the, power, of, parliament, in, its, relationship, with, the, monarch, increased, considerably, after, the, civil, war, and, again, at, the, glorious, revolution, it, also, provided, the, country, with, unprecedented, stability, more, stability, in, turn, helped, assure, more, effective, management, organisation, and, efficiency, parliament, printed, statutes, and, devised, a, more, coherent, parliamentary, procedure, the, rise, of, parliament, proved, especially, important, in, the, sense, that, it, limited, the, repercussions, of, dynastic, complications, that, had, so, often, plunged, england, into, civil, war, parliament, still, ran, the, country, even, in, the, absence, of, suitable, heirs, to, the, throne, and, its, legitimacy, as, a, decision, making, body, reduced, the, royal, prerogatives, of, kings, like, henry, viii, and, the, importance, of, their, whims, for, example, henry, viii, could, not, simply, establish, supremacy, by, proclamation, he, required, parliament, to, enforce, statutes, and, add, felonies, and, treasons, an, important, liberty, for, parliament, was, its, freedom, of, speech, henry, allowed, anything, to, be, spoken, openly, within, parliament, and, speakers, could, not, face, arrest, a, fact, which, they, exploited, incessantly, nevertheless, parliament, in, henry, viii, s, time, offered, up, very, little, objection, to, the, monarch, s, desires, under, his, and, edward, s, reign, the, legislative, body, complied, willingly, with, the, majority, of, the, kings, decisions, much, of, this, compliance, stemmed, from, how, the, english, viewed, and, traditionally, understood, authority, as, williams, described, it, king, and, parliament, were, not, separate, entities, but, a, single, body, of, which, the, monarch, was, the, senior, partner, and, the, lords, and, the, commons, the, lesser, but, still, essential, members, although, its, role, in, government, had, expanded, significantly, in, the, mid, 16th, century, the, parliament, of, england, saw, some, of, its, most, important, gains, in, the, 17th, century, a, series, of, conflicts, between, the, crown, and, parliament, culminated, in, the, execution, of, king, charles, i, in, 1649, for, a, brief, period, england, became, a, commonwealth, with, oliver, cromwell, the, de, facto, ruler, with, the, title, of, lord, protector, frustrated, with, its, decisions, cromwell, purged, and, suspended, parliament, on, several, occasions, a, controversial, figure, notorious, for, his, actions, in, ireland, cromwell, is, nonetheless, regarded, as, essential, to, the, growth, of, democracy, in, england, the, years, of, the, commonwealth, coupled, with, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, 1660, and, the, subsequent, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, helped, reinforce, and, strengthen, parliament, as, an, institution, separate, from, the, crown, the, parliament, of, england, met, until, it, merged, with, the, parliament, of, scotland, under, the, acts, of, union, this, union, created, the, new, parliament, of, great, britain, in, 1707, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, followed, at, the, union, with, ireland, originally, there, was, only, the, parlement, of, paris, born, out, of, the, curia, regis, in, 1307, and, located, inside, the, medieval, royal, palace, now, the, paris, hall, of, justice, the, jurisdiction, of, the, parliament, of, paris, covered, the, entire, kingdom, in, the, thirteenth, century, judicial, functions, were, added, in, 1443, following, the, turmoil, of, the, hundred, years, war, king, charles, vii, of, france, granted, languedoc, its, own, parliament, by, establishing, the, parliament, of, toulouse, the, first, parliament, outside, of, paris, whose, jurisdiction, extended, over, the, most, part, of, southern, france, from, 1443, until, the, french, revolution, several, other, parliaments, were, created, in, some, provinces, of, france, grenoble, bordeaux, all, the, parliaments, could, issue, regulatory, decrees, for, the, application, of, royal, edicts, or, of, customary, practices, they, could, also, refuse, to, register, laws, that, they, judged, contrary, to, fundamental, law, or, simply, as, being, untimely, parliamentary, power, in, france, was, suppressed, more, so, than, in, england, as, a, result, of, absolutism, and, parliaments, were, eventually, overshadowed, by, the, larger, estates, general, up, until, the, french, revolution, when, the, last, estates, general, transformed, itself, into, a, national, assembly, a, legislative, body, whose, existence, is, independent, of, the, royal, power, a, thing, or, ting, old, norse, and, icelandic, ing, other, modern, scandinavian, ting, ding, in, dutch, was, the, governing, assembly, in, germanic, societies, made, up, of, the, free, men, of, the, community, and, presided, by, lawspeakers, the, thing, was, the, assembly, of, the, free, men, of, a, country, province, or, a, hundred, hundare, h, rad, herred, there, were, consequently, hierarchies, of, things, so, that, the, local, things, were, represented, at, the, thing, for, a, larger, area, for, a, province, or, land, at, the, thing, disputes, were, solved, and, political, decisions, were, made, the, place, for, the, thing, was, often, also, the, place, for, public, religious, rites, and, for, commerce, the, thing, met, at, regular, intervals, legislated, elected, chieftains, and, kings, and, judged, according, to, the, law, which, was, memorised, and, recited, by, the, law, speaker, the, judge, the, icelandic, faroese, and, manx, parliaments, trace, their, origins, back, to, the, viking, expansion, originating, from, the, petty, kingdoms, of, norway, as, well, as, denmark, replicating, viking, government, systems, in, the, conquered, territories, such, as, those, represented, by, the, gulating, near, bergen, in, western, norway, later, national, diets, with, chambers, for, different, estates, developed, e, g, in, sweden, and, in, finland, which, was, part, of, sweden, until, 1809, each, with, a, house, of, knights, for, the, nobility, in, both, these, countries, the, national, parliaments, are, now, called, riksdag, in, finland, also, eduskunta, a, word, used, since, the, middle, ages, and, equivalent, of, the, german, word, reichstag, today, the, term, lives, on, in, the, official, names, of, national, legislatures, and, other, institutions, in, the, north, germanic, countries, in, yorkshire, and, former, danelaw, areas, of, england, which, were, subject, to, norse, invasion, and, settlement, the, wapentake, was, another, name, for, the, same, institution, the, sicilian, parliament, dating, to, 1097, evolved, as, the, legislature, of, the, kingdom, of, sicily, the, diet, of, hungary, or, originally, parlamentum, publicum, and, parlamentum, generale, hungarian, orsz, ggy, l, s, became, the, supreme, legislative, institution, in, the, medieval, kingdom, of, hungary, from, the, 1290s, and, in, its, successor, states, royal, hungary, and, the, habsburg, kingdom, of, hungary, throughout, the, early, modern, period, the, name, of, the, legislative, body, was, originally, parlamentum, during, the, middle, ages, the, diet, expression, gained, mostly, in, the, early, modern, period, it, convened, at, regular, intervals, with, interruptions, during, the, period, of, 1527, to, 1918, and, again, until, 1946, some, researchers, have, traced, the, roots, of, the, hungarian, institution, of, national, assemblies, as, far, back, as, the, 11th, century, this, based, on, documentary, evidence, that, on, certain, important, occasions, under, the, reigns, of, king, ladislaus, i, and, king, coloman, the, learned, assemblies, were, held, on, a, national, scale, where, both, ecclesiastic, and, secular, dignitaries, made, appearances, the, first, exact, written, mention, of, the, word, parlamentum, parliament, for, the, nation, wide, assembly, originated, during, the, reign, of, king, andrew, ii, in, the, golden, bull, of, 1222, which, reaffirmed, the, rights, of, the, smaller, nobles, of, the, old, and, new, classes, of, royal, servants, servientes, regis, against, both, the, crown, and, the, magnates, and, to, defend, the, rights, of, the, whole, nation, against, the, crown, by, restricting, the, powers, of, the, latter, in, certain, fields, and, legalizing, refusal, to, obey, its, unlawful, unconstitutional, commands, the, ius, resistendi, the, lesser, nobles, also, began, to, present, andrew, with, grievances, a, practice, that, evolved, into, the, institution, of, the, hungarian, diet, an, institutionalized, hungarian, parliament, emerged, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, beginning, under, king, charles, i, continuing, under, subsequent, kings, through, into, the, reign, of, king, matthias, i, the, diet, was, essentially, convened, by, the, king, however, under, the, rule, of, heavy, handed, kings, like, louis, the, great, and, during, reign, of, the, early, absolutist, matthias, corvinus, the, parliaments, were, often, convened, to, announce, the, royal, decisions, and, had, no, significant, power, of, its, own, since, the, reign, of, the, jagiellonian, dynasty, the, parliament, has, regained, most, of, its, former, power, according, to, the, chronicles, of, gallus, anonymus, the, first, legendary, polish, ruler, siemowit, who, began, the, piast, dynasty, was, chosen, by, an, ancient, wiec, council, the, idea, of, the, wiec, led, to, the, development, of, the, polish, parliament, the, sejm, in, around, 1180, the, term, sejm, comes, from, an, old, polish, expression, denoting, a, meeting, of, the, populace, the, power, of, early, sejms, grew, between, 1146, and, 1295, when, the, power, of, individual, rulers, waned, and, various, councils, grew, stronger, since, the, 14th, century, irregular, sejms, described, in, various, latin, sources, as, contentio, generalis, conventio, magna, conventio, solemna, parlamentum, parlamentum, generale, dieta, have, been, convened, by, poland, s, monarchs, from, 1374, the, king, had, to, receive, permission, from, that, assembly, to, raise, taxes, and, the, 1454, nieszawa, statutes, granted, the, szlachta, nobles, unprecedented, concessions, and, authority, the, general, sejm, polish, sejm, generalny, or, sejm, walny, first, convoked, by, the, john, i, albert, in, 1493, near, piotrk, w, evolved, from, earlier, regional, and, provincial, meetings, called, sejmiks, simultaneously, the, senate, was, founded, on, the, earlier, curia, regis, convened, at, the, king, s, discretion, hence, the, year, 1493, marked, the, beginning, of, a, bicameral, legislative, body, of, government, with, the, subsequent, development, of, polish, golden, liberty, in, the, next, several, decades, the, sejm, s, powers, systematically, increased, poland, was, among, the, few, countries, in, europe, where, the, parliament, played, an, especially, important, role, in, its, national, identity, as, it, contributed, to, the, unity, of, the, nation, and, the, state, the, general, parliament, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, consisted, of, three, estates, the, king, of, poland, the, senate, consisting, of, ministers, palatines, castellans, and, roman, catholic, bishops, and, the, chamber, of, envoys, comprising, 170, nobles, acting, on, behalf, of, their, holdings, as, well, as, representatives, of, major, cities, who, did, not, possess, any, voting, privileges, in, 1573, a, convocation, sejm, established, an, elective, monarchy, in, the, commonwealth, after, its, self, proclamation, as, an, independent, kingdom, in, 1139, by, afonso, i, of, portugal, followed, by, the, recognition, by, the, kingdom, of, le, n, in, the, treaty, of, zamora, of, 1143, the, first, historically, established, cortes, of, the, kingdom, of, portugal, occurred, in, 1211, in, coimbra, by, initiative, of, afonso, ii, of, portugal, these, established, the, first, general, laws, of, the, kingdom, leis, gerais, do, reino, protection, of, the, king, s, property, stipulation, of, measures, for, the, administration, of, justice, and, the, rights, of, his, subjects, to, be, protected, from, abuses, by, royal, officials, and, confirming, the, clerical, donations, of, the, previous, king, sancho, i, of, portugal, these, cortes, also, affirmed, the, validity, of, canon, law, for, the, church, in, portugal, while, introducing, the, prohibition, of, the, purchase, of, lands, by, churches, or, monasteries, although, they, can, be, acquired, by, donations, and, legacies, after, the, conquest, of, algarve, in, 1249, the, kingdom, of, portugal, completed, its, reconquista, in, 1254, king, afonso, iii, of, portugal, summoned, portuguese, cortes, in, leiria, with, the, inclusion, of, burghers, from, old, and, newly, incorporated, municipalities, this, inclusion, establishes, the, cortes, of, leiria, of, 1254, as, the, second, sample, of, modern, parliamentarism, in, the, history, of, europe, after, the, cortes, of, le, n, in, 1188, in, these, cortes, the, monetagio, was, introduced, a, fixed, sum, was, to, be, paid, by, the, burghers, to, the, crown, as, a, substitute, for, the, septennium, the, traditional, revision, of, the, face, value, of, coinage, by, the, crown, every, seven, years, these, cortes, also, introduced, staple, laws, on, the, douro, river, favoring, the, new, royal, city, of, vila, nova, de, gaia, at, the, expense, of, the, old, episcopal, city, of, porto, the, portuguese, cortes, met, again, under, king, afonso, iii, of, portugal, in, 1256, 1261, and, 1273, always, by, royal, summon, medieval, kings, of, portugal, continued, to, rely, on, small, assemblies, of, notables, and, only, summoned, the, full, cortes, on, extraordinary, occasions, a, cortes, would, be, called, if, the, king, wanted, to, introduce, new, taxes, change, some, fundamental, laws, announce, significant, shifts, in, foreign, policy, e, g, ratify, treaties, or, settle, matters, of, royal, succession, issues, where, the, cooperation, and, assent, of, the, towns, was, thought, necessary, changing, taxation, especially, requesting, war, subsidies, was, probably, the, most, frequent, reason, for, convening, the, cortes, as, the, nobles, and, clergy, were, largely, tax, exempt, setting, taxation, involved, intensive, negotiations, between, the, royal, council, and, the, burgher, delegates, at, the, cortes, delegates, procuradores, not, only, considered, the, king, s, proposals, but, in, turn, also, used, the, cortes, to, submit, petitions, of, their, own, to, the, royal, council, on, a, myriad, of, matters, e, g, extending, and, confirming, town, privileges, punishing, abuses, of, officials, introducing, new, price, controls, constraints, on, jews, pledges, on, coinage, etc, the, royal, response, to, these, petitions, became, enshrined, as, ordinances, and, statutes, thus, giving, the, cortes, the, aspect, of, a, legislature, these, petitions, were, originally, referred, to, as, aggravamentos, grievances, then, artigos, articles, and, eventually, capitulos, chapters, in, a, cortes, gerais, petitions, were, discussed, and, voted, upon, separately, by, each, estate, and, required, the, approval, of, at, least, two, of, the, three, estates, before, being, passed, up, to, the, royal, council, the, proposal, was, then, subject, to, royal, veto, either, accepted, or, rejected, by, the, king, in, its, entirety, before, becoming, law, nonetheless, the, exact, extent, of, cortes, power, was, ambiguous, kings, insisted, on, their, ancient, prerogative, to, promulgate, laws, independently, of, the, cortes, the, compromise, in, theory, was, that, ordinances, enacted, in, cortes, could, only, be, modified, or, repealed, by, cortes, but, even, that, principle, was, often, circumvented, or, ignored, in, practice, the, cortes, probably, had, their, heyday, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, reaching, their, apex, when, john, i, of, portugal, relied, almost, wholly, upon, the, bourgeoisie, for, his, power, for, a, period, after, the, 1383, 1385, crisis, the, cortes, were, convened, almost, annually, but, as, time, went, on, they, became, less, important, portuguese, monarchs, tapping, into, the, riches, of, the, portuguese, empire, overseas, grew, less, dependent, on, cortes, subsidies, and, convened, them, less, frequently, john, ii, r, 1481, 1495, used, them, to, break, the, high, nobility, but, dispensed, with, them, otherwise, manuel, i, r, 1495, 1521, convened, them, only, four, times, in, his, long, reign, by, the, time, of, sebastian, r, 1554, 1578, the, cortes, was, practically, an, irrelevance, curiously, the, cortes, gained, a, new, importance, with, the, iberian, union, of, 1581, finding, a, role, as, the, representative, of, portuguese, interests, to, the, new, habsburg, monarch, the, cortes, played, a, critical, role, in, the, 1640, restoration, and, enjoyed, a, brief, period, of, resurgence, during, the, reign, of, john, iv, of, portugal, r, 1640, 1656, but, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, it, found, itself, sidelined, once, again, the, last, cortes, met, in, 1698, for, the, mere, formality, of, confirming, the, appointment, of, infante, john, future, john, v, of, portugal, as, the, successor, of, peter, ii, of, portugal, thereafter, portuguese, kings, ruled, as, absolute, monarchs, and, no, cortes, were, assembled, for, over, a, century, this, state, of, affairs, came, to, an, end, with, the, liberal, revolution, of, 1820, which, set, in, motion,

anyone, who, rung, the, veche, bell, although, it, is, more, likely, that, the, common, procedure, was, more, complex, this, bell, was, a, symbol, of, republican, sovereignty, and, independence, the,

taxation, although, taxation, was, only, raised, irregularly, in, scotland, in, the, medieval, period, but, it, also, had, a, strong, influence, over, justice, foreign, policy, war, and, all, manner, of, other, legislation, whether, political, ecclesiastical, social, or, economic, parliamentary, business, was, also, carried, out, by, sister, institutions, before, c, 1500, by, general, council,

union, in, 1801, united, the, parliament, of, great, britain, and, the, parliament, of, ireland, into, a, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, the, british, parliament, is, often, referred, to, as, the, mother, of, parliaments, in, fact, a, misquotation, of, john, bright, who, remarked, in, 1865, that, england, is, the, mother, of, parliaments, because, the, british, parliament, has, been, the, model, for, most, other, parliamentary, systems, and, its, acts, have, created, many, other, parliaments, many, nations, with, parliaments, have, to, some, degree, emulated, the, british, three, tier, model, known, as, the, westminster, system, most, countries, in, europe, and, the, commonwealth, have, similarly, organised, parliaments, with, a, largely, ceremonial, head, of, state, who, formally, opens, and, closes, parliament, a, large, elected, lower, house, and, a, smaller, upper, house, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, has, been, described, as, characterised, by, the, stability, of, its, governing, institutions, and, its, capacity, to, absorb, change, in, the, united, kingdom, parliament, consists, of, the, house, of, commons, the, house, of, lords, and, the, monarch, the, house, of, commons, is, composed, of, 650, members, who, are, directly, elected, by, british, citizens, to, represent, single, member, constituencies, the, leader, of, a, party, that, wins, more, than, half, the, seats, or, less, than, half, but, is, able, to, gain, the, support, of, smaller, parties, to, achieve, a, majority, in, the, house, is, invited, by, the, monarch, to, form, a,

second, reading, is, where, the, bill, as, a, whole, is, considered, third, reading, is, detailed, consideration, of, clauses, of, the, bill, in, addition, to, the, three, readings, a, bill, also, goes, through, a, committee, stage, where, it, is, considered, in, great, detail, once, the, bill, has, been, passed, by, one, house, it, goes, to, the, other, and, essentially, repeats, the, process, if, after, the, two, sets, of, readings, there, are, disagreements, between, the, versions, that, the, two, houses, passed, it, is, returned, to, the, first, house, for, consideration, of, the, amendments, made, by, the, second, if, it, passes, through, the, amendment, stage, royal, assent, is, granted, and, the, bill, becomes, law, as, an, act, of, parliament, the, house, of, lords, is, the, less, powerful, of, the, two, houses, as, a, result, of, the, parliament, acts, 1911, and, 1949, these, acts, removed, the, veto, power, of, the, lords, over, a, great, deal, of, legislation, if, a, bill, is, certified, by, the, speaker, of, the, house, of, commons, as, a, money, bill, i, e, acts, raising, taxes, and, similar, then, the, lords, can, only, block, it, for, a, month, if, an, ordinary, bill, originates, in, the, commons, the, lords, can, only, block, it, for, a, maximum, of, one, session, of, parliament, the, exceptions, to, this, rule, are, things, like, bills, to, prolong, the, life, of, a, parliament, beyond, five, years, in, addition, to, functioning, as, the, second, chamber, of, parliament, the, house, of, lords, was, also, the, final, court, of, appeal, for, much, of, the, law, of, the, united, kingdom, a, combination, of, judicial, and, legislative, function, that, recalls, its, origin, in, the, curia, regis, this, changed, in, october, 2009, when, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, kingdom, opened, and, acquired, the, former, jurisdiction, of, the, house, of, lords, since, 1999, there, has, been, a, scottish, parliament, in, edinburgh, and, since, 2020, a, senedd, or, welsh, parliament, in, cardiff, however, these, national, unicameral, legislatures, do, not, have, complete, power, over, their, respective, countries, of, the, united, kingdom, holding, only, those, powers, devolved, to, them, by, westminster, from, 1997, they, cannot, legislate, on, defence, issues, currency, or, national, taxation, e, g, vat, or, income, tax,

period, civil, rights, were, expanded, and, power, shifted, from, the, monarch, to, parliament, while, suffrage, did, not, become, universal, the, taxed, peasantry, was, represented, in, parliament, although, with, little, influence, and, commoners, without, taxed, property, had, no, suffrage, at, all, changes, in, poland, s, internal, situation, in, the, 1980s, led, to, the, round, table, talks, which, ended, in, the, signing, of, the, famous, round, table, agreement, on, 5, april, 1989, the, agreement, spearheaded, the, evolutionary, transformation, of, the, country, s, political, system,

the, president, of, the, polish, people, s, republic, and, the, senate, both, to, be, elected, in, free, and, democratic, elections, in, the, sejm, the, opposition, was, allocated, 35, of, the, mandates, thus, the, so, called, contract, elections, could, not, be, fully, democratic, the, sejm, first, chamber, became, superior, to, the, senate, second, chamber, in, addition, the, institution, of, national, assembly, was, established, consisting, of, the, sejm, and, the, senate, sitting, jointly, to, elect, the, president, of, the, polish, people, s, republic, a, declaration, of, the, solidarity, citizens, committee, heralded, the, prompt, enactment, of, a, new, democratic, constitution, and, electoral, law, as, a, result, of, solidarity, s, success, in, elections, to, the, sejm, and, the, senate, profound, reforms, of, the, political, system, were, undertaken, by, adopting, an, amendment, to, the, constitution, on, 29, december, 1989, in, the, constitution, the, republic, of, poland, was, defined, as, a, democratic, state, ruled, by, law, as, the, provisional, constitution, lasted, too, long, it, was, decided, to, adopt, a, provisional, regulation, in, the, form, of, the, so, called, small, constitution, the, president, signed, it, on, 17, october, 1992, the, small, constitution, regulated, above, all, the, relationship, between, the, executive, and, legislative, powers, on, the, basis, of, the, doctrine, of, separation, of, powers, a, bicameral, parliament, was, maintained, after, long, years, of, legislative, work, on, 2, april, 1997, the, national,

system, in, poland, it, is, the, first, constitution, of, the, third, republic, that, was, the, first, constitution, of, the, third, republic, the, act, defined, the, position, of, the, sejm, and, the, senate, within, the, system, without, using, the, term, parliament, it, adopted, the, doctrine, of, separation, of, powers, which, provided, for, a, balance, between, the, legislative, and, executive, powers, in, practice, the, binding, provisions, of, the, constitution, ensure, the, supremacy, of, the, legislative, power, both, chambers, are, autonomous, bodies, independent, of, each, other, with, their, own, powers, the, constitution, retained, the, principle, of, bicameralism, of, the, legislature, the, sejm, and, the, senate, sitting, jointly, constitute, the, national, assembly, characteristically, the, new, constitution, conferred, very, extensive, powers, on, the, sejm, on, the, other, hand, the, powers, of, the, senate, are, limited, as, in, the, constitutions, of, 1921, and, 1992, many, parliaments, are, part, of, a, parliamentary, system, of, government, in, which, the, executive, is, constitutionally, answerable, to, the, parliament, from, the, genetic, moment, of, the, birth, of, government, motion, of, confidence, to, the, final, moment, of, his, termination, motion, of, no, confidence, through, all, the, commitments, that, can, be, added, to, the, government, contract, from, time, to, time, through, motions, and, resolutions, some, restrict, the, use, of, the, word, parliament, to, parliamentary, systems, while, others, use, the, word, for, any, elected, legislative, body, parliaments, usually, consist, of, chambers, or, houses, and, are, usually, either, bicameral, or, unicameral, although, more, complex, models, exist, or, have, existed, see, tricameralism, in, some, parliamentary, systems, the, prime, minister, is, a, member, of, the, parliament, e, g, in, the, united, kingdom, whereas, in, others, they, are, not, e, g, in, the, netherlands, they, are, commonly, the, leader, of, the, majority, party, in, the, lower, house, of, parliament, but, only, hold, the, office, as, long, as, the, confidence, of, the, house, is, maintained, if, members, of, the, lower, house, lose, faith, in, the, leader, for, whatever, reason, they, can, call, a, vote, of, no, confidence, and, force, the, prime, minister, to, resign, this, can, be, particularly, dangerous, to, a, government, when, the, distribution, of, seats, among, different, parties, is, relatively, even, in, which, case, a, new, election, is, often, called, shortly, thereafter, however, in, case, of, general, discontent, with, the, head, of, government, their, replacement, can, be, made, very, smoothly, without, all, the, complications, that, it, represents, in, the, case, of, a, presidential, system, the, parliamentary, system, can, be, contrasted, with, a, presidential, system, such, as, the, american, congressional, system, which, operates, under, a, stricter, separation, of, powers, whereby, the, executive, does, not, form, part, of, nor, is, it, appointed, by, the, parliamentary, or, legislative, body, in, such, a, system, congresses, do, not, select, or, dismiss, heads, of, governments, and, governments, cannot, request, an, early, dissolution, as, may, be, the, case, for, parliaments, some, states, such, as, france, have, a, semi, presidential, system, which, falls, between, parliamentary, and, congressional, systems, combining, a, powerful, head, of, state, president, with, a, head, of, government, the, prime, minister, who, is, responsible, to, parliament, australia, s, states, and, territories, in, the, federal, bicameral, kingdom, of, belgium, there, is, a, curious, asymmetrical, constellation, serving, as, directly,
