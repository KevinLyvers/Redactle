the, fur, trade, is, a, worldwide, industry, dealing, in, the, acquisition, and, sale, of, animal, fur, since, the, establishment, of, a, world, fur, market, in, the, early, modern, period, furs, of, boreal, polar, and, cold, temperate, mammalian, animals, have, been, the, most, valued, historically, the, trade, stimulated, the, exploration, and, colonization, of, siberia, northern, north, america, and, the, south, shetland, and, south, sandwich, islands, today, the, importance, of, the, fur, trade, has, diminished, it, is, based, on, pelts, produced, at, fur, farms, and, regulated, fur, bearer, trapping, but, has, become, controversial, animal, rights, organizations, oppose, the, fur, trade, citing, that, animals, are, brutally, killed, and, sometimes, skinned, alive, fur, has, been, replaced, in, some, clothing, by, synthetic, imitations, for, example, as, in, ruffs, on, hoods, of, parkas, before, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, russia, was, a, major, supplier, of, fur, pelts, to, western, europe, and, parts, of, asia, its, trade, developed, in, the, early, middle, ages, 500, 1000, ad, ce, first, through, exchanges, at, posts, around, the, baltic, and, black, seas, the, main, trading, market, destination, was, the, german, city, of, leipzig, kievan, rus, was, the, first, supplier, of, the, russian, fur, trade, originally, russia, exported, raw, furs, consisting, in, most, cases, of, the, pelts, of, martens, beavers, wolves, foxes, squirrels, and, hares, between, the, 16th, and, 18th, centuries, russians, began, to, settle, in, siberia, a, region, rich, in, many, mammal, fur, species, such, as, arctic, fox, lynx, sable, sea, otter, and, stoat, ermine, in, a, search, for, the, prized, sea, otter, pelts, first, used, in, china, and, later, for, the, northern, fur, seal, the, russian, empire, expanded, into, north, america, notably, alaska, from, the, 17th, through, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, russia, was, the, world, s, largest, supplier, of, fur, the, fur, trade, played, a, vital, role, in, the, development, of, siberia, the, russian, far, east, and, the, russian, colonization, of, the, americas, as, recognition, of, the, importance, of, the, trade, to, the, siberian, economy, the, sable, is, a, regional, symbol, of, sverdlovsk, oblast, in, the, urals, and, novosibirsk, tyumen, and, irkutsk, oblasts, in, siberia, european, contact, with, north, america, with, its, vast, forests, and, wildlife, particularly, the, beaver, led, to, the, continent, becoming, a, major, supplier, in, the, 17th, century, of, fur, pelts, for, the, fur, felt, hat, and, fur, trimming, and, garment, trades, of, europe, fur, was, relied, on, to, make, warm, clothing, a, critical, consideration, prior, to, the, organization, of, coal, distribution, for, heating, portugal, and, spain, played, major, roles, in, fur, trading, after, the, 15th, century, with, their, business, in, fur, hats, from, as, early, as, the, 10th, century, merchants, and, boyars, of, the, city, state, of, novgorod, had, exploited, the, fur, resources, beyond, the, portage, a, watershed, at, the, white, lake, that, represents, the, door, to, the, entire, northwestern, part, of, eurasia, they, began, by, establishing, trading, posts, along, the, volga, and, vychegda, river, networks, and, requiring, the, komi, people, to, give, them, furs, as, tribute, novgorod, the, chief, fur, trade, center, prospered, as, the, easternmost, trading, post, of, the, hanseatic, league, novgorodians, expanded, farther, east, and, north, coming, into, contact, with, the, pechora, people, of, the, pechora, river, valley, and, the, yugra, people, residing, near, the, urals, both, of, these, native, tribes, offered, more, resistance, than, the, komi, killing, many, russian, tribute, collectors, throughout, the, tenth, and, eleventh, centuries, as, the, grand, principality, of, moscow, increased, in, power, over, the, course, of, the, 15th, century, and, proceeded, with, the, gathering, of, the, russian, lands, the, muscovite, state, began, to, rival, the, novgorodians, in, the, north, for, the, russian, fur, trade, ultimately, novgorod, would, lose, its, autonomy, and, be, absorbed, by, the, authorities, in, moscow, along, with, its, vast, hinterland, at, the, same, time, moscow, began, subjugating, many, native, tribes, one, strategy, involved, exploiting, antagonisms, between, tribes, notably, the, komi, and, yugra, by, recruiting, men, of, one, tribe, to, fight, in, an, army, against, the, other, tribe, campaigns, against, native, tribes, in, siberia, remained, insignificant, until, they, began, on, a, much, larger, scale, in, 1483, and, 1499, besides, the, novgorodians, and, the, indigenes, the, muscovites, also, had, to, contend, with, the, various, muslim, tatar, khanates, to, their, east, in, 1552, ivan, iv, the, tsar, of, all, russia, took, a, significant, step, towards, securing, russian, hegemony, in, siberia, when, he, sent, a, large, army, to, attack, the, khanate, of, kazan, and, ended, up, obtaining, the, territory, from, the, volga, to, the, ural, mountains, at, this, point, the, phrase, ruler, of, obdor, konda, and, all, siberian, lands, became, part, of, the, title, of, the, tsar, in, moscow, even, so, problems, ensued, after, 1558, when, ivan, iv, sent, grigory, stroganov, c, 1533, 1577, to, colonize, land, on, the, kama, and, to, subjugate, and, enserf, the, komi, living, there, the, stroganov, family, soon, came, into, conflict, in, 1573, with, the, khan, of, sibir, whose, land, they, encroached, on, ivan, told, the, stroganovs, to, hire, cossack, mercenaries, to, protect, the, new, settlement, from, the, tatars, from, c, 1581, the, band, of, cossacks, led, by, yermak, timofeyevich, fought, many, battles, that, eventually, culminated, in, a, tartar, victory, in, 1584, and, the, temporary, end, to, russian, occupation, in, the, area, in, 1584, ivan, s, son, feodor, sent, military, governors, voivodas, and, soldiers, to, reclaim, yermak, conquests, and, officially, to, annex, the, land, held, by, the, khanate, of, sibir, similar, skirmishes, with, tartars, took, place, across, siberia, as, russian, expansion, continued, russian, conquerors, treated, the, natives, of, siberia, as, easily, exploited, subjects, who, were, inferior, to, them, as, they, penetrated, deeper, into, siberia, traders, built, outposts, or, winter, lodges, called, zimovye, where, they, lived, and, collected, fur, tribute, from, native, tribes, by, 1620, russia, dominated, the, land, from, the, urals, eastward, to, the, yenisey, valley, and, to, the, altai, mountains, in, the, south, comprising, about, 1, 25, million, square, miles, of, land, furs, would, become, russia, s, largest, source, of, wealth, during, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, keeping, up, with, the, advances, of, western, europe, required, significant, capital, and, russia, did, not, have, sources, of, gold, and, silver, but, it, did, have, furs, which, became, known, as, soft, gold, and, provided, russia, with, hard, currency, the, russian, government, received, income, from, the, fur, trade, through, two, taxes, the, yasak, or, iasak, tax, on, natives, and, the, 10, sovereign, tithing, tax, imposed, on, both, the, catch, and, sale, of, fur, pelts, fur, was, in, great, demand, in, western, europe, especially, sable, and, marten, since, european, forest, resources, had, been, over, hunted, and, furs, had, become, extremely, scarce, fur, trading, allowed, russia, to, purchase, from, europe, goods, that, it, lacked, like, lead, tin, precious, metals, textiles, firearms, and, sulphur, russia, also, traded, furs, with, ottoman, turkey, and, other, countries, in, the, middle, east, in, exchange, for, silk, textiles, spices, and, dried, fruit, the, high, prices, that, sable, black, fox, and, marten, furs, could, generate, in, international, markets, spurred, a, fur, fever, in, which, many, russians, moved, to, siberia, as, independent, trappers, from, 1585, to, 1680, tens, of, thousands, of, sable, and, other, valuable, pelts, were, obtained, in, siberia, each, year, the, primary, way, for, the, russian, state, to, obtain, furs, was, by, exacting, a, fur, tribute, from, the, siberian, natives, called, a, yasak, yasak, was, usually, a, fixed, number, of, sable, pelts, which, every, male, tribe, member, who, was, at, least, fifteen, years, old, had, to, supply, to, russian, officials, officials, enforced, yasak, through, coercion, and, by, taking, hostages, usually, the, tribe, chiefs, or, members, of, the, chief, s, family, at, first, russians, were, content, to, trade, with, the, natives, exchanging, goods, like, pots, axes, and, beads, for, the, prized, sables, that, the, natives, did, not, value, but, greater, demand, for, furs, led, to, violence, and, force, becoming, the, primary, means, of, obtaining, the, furs, the, largest, problem, with, the, yasak, system, was, that, russian, governors, were, prone, to, corruption, because, they, received, no, salary, they, resorted, to, illegal, means, of, getting, furs, for, themselves, including, bribing, customs, officials, to, allow, them, to, personally, collect, yasak, extorting, natives, by, exacting, yasak, multiple, times, over, or, requiring, tribute, from, independent, trappers, russian, fur, trappers, called, promyshlenniki, hunted, in, one, of, two, types, of, bands, of, 10, 15, men, called, vatagi, the, first, was, an, independent, band, of, blood, relatives, or, unrelated, people, who, contributed, an, equal, share, of, the, hunting, expedition, expenses, the, second, was, a, band, of, hired, hunters, who, participated, in, expeditions, fully, funded, by, the, trading, companies, which, employed, them, members, of, an, independent, vataga, cooperated, and, shared, all, necessary, work, associated, with, fur, trapping, including, making, and, setting, traps, building, forts, and, camps, stockpiling, firewood, and, grain, and, fishing, all, fur, pelts, went, into, a, common, pool, that, the, band, divided, equally, among, themselves, after, russian, officials, exacted, the, tithing, tax, on, the, other, hand, a, trading, company, provided, hired, fur, trappers, with, the, money, needed, for, transportation, food, and, supplies, and, once, the, hunt, was, finished, the, employer, received, two, thirds, of, the, pelts, and, the, remaining, ones, were, sold, and, the, proceeds, divided, evenly, among, the, hired, laborers, during, the, summer, promyshlenniki, would, set, up, a, summer, camp, to, stockpile, grain, and, fish, and, many, engaged, in, agricultural, work, for, extra, money, during, late, summer, or, early, fall, the, vatagi, left, their, hunting, grounds, surveyed, the, area, and, set, up, a, winter, camp, each, member, of, the, group, set, at, least, 10, traps, and, the, vatagi, divided, into, smaller, groups, of, two, to, three, men, who, cooperated, to, maintain, certain, traps, promyshlenniki, checked, traps, daily, resetting, them, or, replacing, bait, whenever, necessary, the, promyshlenniki, employed, both, passive, and, active, hunting, strategies, the, passive, approach, involved, setting, traps, while, the, active, approach, involved, the, use, of, hunting, dogs, and, of, bows, and, arrows, occasionally, hunters, also, followed, sable, tracks, to, their, burrows, around, which, they, placed, nets, and, waited, for, the, sable, to, emerge, the, hunting, season, began, around, the, time, of, the, first, snow, in, october, or, november, and, continued, until, early, spring, hunting, expeditions, lasted, two, to, three, years, on, average, but, occasionally, longer, because, of, the, long, hunting, season, and, the, fact, that, passage, back, to, russia, was, difficult, and, costly, beginning, around, the, 1650s, 1660s, many, promyshlenniki, chose, to, stay, and, settle, in, siberia, from, 1620, to, 1680, a, total, of, 15, 983, trappers, operated, in, siberia, the, north, american, fur, trade, began, as, early, as, the, 1500s, between, europeans, and, first, nations, see, early, french, fur, trading, and, was, a, central, part, of, the, early, history, of, contact, between, europeans, and, the, native, peoples, of, what, is, now, the, united, states, and, canada, dr, s, e, dawson, s, admirable, the, saint, lawrence, its, basin, border, lands, covers, in, detail, the, twenty, or, so, main, gateways, connecting, the, st, lawrence, river, with, its, neighbouring, basins, though, these, were, all, once, canoe, routes, not, all, were, trade, routes, in, 1578, there, were, 350, european, fishing, vessels, at, newfoundland, sailors, began, to, trade, metal, implements, particularly, knives, for, the, natives, well, worn, pelts, the, first, pelts, in, demand, were, beaver, and, sea, otter, as, well, as, occasionally, deer, bear, ermine, and, skunk, fur, robes, were, blankets, of, sewn, together, native, tanned, beaver, pelts, the, pelts, were, called, castor, gras, in, french, and, coat, beaver, in, english, and, were, soon, recognized, by, the, newly, developed, felt, hat, making, industry, as, particularly, useful, for, felting, some, historians, seeking, to, explain, the, term, castor, gras, have, assumed, that, coat, beaver, was, rich, in, human, oils, from, having, been, worn, so, long, much, of, the, top, hair, was, worn, away, through, usage, exposing, the, valuable, under, wool, and, that, this, is, what, made, it, attractive, to, the, hatters, this, seems, unlikely, since, grease, interferes, with, the, felting, of, wool, rather, than, enhancing, it, by, the, 1580s, beaver, wool, was, the, major, starting, material, of, the, french, felt, hatters, hat, makers, began, to, use, it, in, england, soon, after, particularly, after, huguenot, refugees, brought, their, skills, and, tastes, with, them, from, france, captain, chauvin, made, the, first, organized, attempt, to, control, the, fur, trade, in, new, france, in, 1599, he, acquired, a, monopoly, from, henry, iv, and, tried, to, establish, a, colony, near, the, mouth, of, the, saguenay, river, at, tadoussac, french, explorers, like, samuel, de, champlain, voyageurs, and, coureur, des, bois, such, as, tienne, br, l, radisson, la, salle, and, le, sueur, while, seeking, routes, through, the, continent, established, relationships, with, amerindians, and, continued, to, expand, the, trade, of, fur, pelts, for, items, considered, common, by, the, europeans, mammal, winter, pelts, were, prized, for, warmth, particularly, animal, pelts, for, beaver, wool, felt, hats, which, were, an, expensive, status, symbol, in, europe, the, demand, for, beaver, wool, felt, hats, was, such, that, the, beaver, in, europe, and, european, russia, had, largely, disappeared, through, exploitation, in, 1613, dallas, carite, and, adriaen, block, headed, expeditions, to, establish, fur, trade, relationships, with, the, mohawk, and, mohican, by, 1614, the, dutch, were, sending, vessels, to, secure, large, economic, returns, from, fur, trading, the, fur, trade, of, new, netherland, through, the, port, of, new, amsterdam, depended, largely, on, the, trading, depot, at, fort, orange, now, albany, on, the, upper, hudson, river, much, of, the, fur, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, canada, smuggled, south, by, entrepreneurs, who, wished, to, avoid, the, colony, s, government, imposed, monopoly, there, england, was, slower, to, enter, the, american, fur, trade, than, france, and, the, dutch, republic, but, as, soon, as, english, colonies, were, established, development, companies, learned, that, furs, provided, the, best, way, for, the, colonists, to, remit, value, back, to, the, mother, country, furs, were, being, dispatched, from, virginia, soon, after, 1610, and, the, plymouth, colony, was, sending, substantial, amounts, of, beaver, to, its, london, agents, through, the, 1620s, and, 1630s, london, merchants, tried, to, take, over, france, s, fur, trade, in, the, st, lawrence, river, valley, taking, advantage, of, one, of, england, s, wars, with, france, sir, david, kirke, captured, quebec, in, 1629, and, brought, the, year, s, produce, of, furs, back, to, london, other, english, merchants, also, traded, for, furs, around, the, saint, lawrence, river, region, in, the, 1630s, but, these, were, officially, discouraged, such, efforts, ceased, as, france, strengthened, its, presence, in, canada, much, of, the, fur, trade, in, north, america, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, was, dominated, by, the, canadian, fur, shipping, network, that, developed, in, new, france, under, the, fur, monopoly, held, first, by, the, company, of, one, hundred, associates, then, followed, in, 1664, by, the, french, west, india, company, steadily, expanding, fur, trapping, and, shipping, across, a, network, of, frontier, forts, further, west, that, eventually, went, all, the, way, to, modern, day, winnipeg, in, western, canada, by, the, mid, 1700s, coming, into, direct, contact, and, opposition, with, the, english, fur, trappers, stationed, out, of, york, factory, at, hudson, bay, meanwhile, the, new, england, fur, trade, expanded, as, well, not, only, inland, but, northward, along, the, coast, into, the, bay, of, fundy, region, london, s, access, to, high, quality, furs, was, greatly, increased, with, the, takeover, of, new, amsterdam, whereupon, the, fur, trade, of, that, colony, now, called, new, york, fell, into, english, hands, with, the, 1667, treaty, of, breda, in, 1668, the, english, fur, trade, entered, a, new, phase, two, french, citizens, pierre, esprit, radisson, and, m, dard, des, groseilliers, had, traded, with, great, success, west, of, lake, superior, in, 1659, 60, but, upon, their, return, to, canada, most, of, their, furs, were, seized, by, the, authorities, their, trading, voyage, had, convinced, them, that, the, best, fur, country, was, far, to, the, north, and, west, and, could, best, be, reached, by, ships, sailing, into, hudson, bay, their, treatment, in, canada, suggested, that, they, would, not, find, support, from, france, for, their, scheme, the, pair, went, to, new, england, where, they, found, local, financial, support, for, at, least, two, attempts, to, reach, hudson, bay, both, unsuccessful, their, ideas, had, reached, the, ears, of, english, authorities, however, and, in, 1665, radisson, and, groseilliers, were, persuaded, to, go, to, london, after, some, setbacks, a, number, of, english, investors, were, found, to, back, another, attempt, for, hudson, bay, two, ships, were, sent, out, in, 1668, one, with, radisson, aboard, had, to, turn, back, but, the, other, the, nonsuch, with, groseilliers, did, penetrate, the, bay, there, she, was, able, to, trade, with, the, indigenes, collecting, a, fine, cargo, of, beaver, skins, before, the, expedition, returned, to, london, in, october, 1669, the, delighted, investors, sought, a, royal, charter, which, they, obtained, the, next, year, this, charter, established, the, hudson, s, bay, company, and, granted, it, a, monopoly, to, trade, into, all, the, rivers, that, emptied, into, hudson, bay, from, 1670, onwards, the, hudson, s, bay, company, sent, two, or, three, trading, ships, into, the, bay, every, year, they, brought, back, furs, mainly, beaver, and, sold, them, sometimes, by, private, treaty, but, usually, by, public, auction, the, beaver, was, bought, mainly, for, the, english, hat, making, trade, while, the, fine, furs, went, to, the, netherlands, and, germany, meanwhile, in, the, southern, colonies, a, deerskin, trade, was, established, around, 1670, based, at, the, export, hub, of, charleston, south, carolina, word, spread, among, native, hunters, that, the, europeans, would, exchange, pelts, for, the, european, manufactured, goods, that, were, highly, desired, in, native, communities, carolinan, traders, stocked, axe, heads, knives, awls, fish, hooks, cloth, of, various, type, and, color, woolen, blankets, linen, shirts, kettles, jewelry, glass, beads, muskets, ammunition, and, powder, to, exchange, on, a, per, pelt, basis, colonial, trading, posts, in, the, southern, colonies, also, introduced, many, types, of, alcohol, especially, brandy, and, rum, for, trade, european, traders, flocked, to, the, north, american, continent, and, made, huge, profits, from, the, exchange, a, metal, axe, head, for, example, was, exchanged, for, one, beaver, pelt, also, called, a, beaver, blanket, the, same, pelt, could, fetch, enough, to, buy, dozens, of, axe, heads, in, england, making, the, fur, trade, extremely, profitable, for, the, europeans, the, natives, used, the, iron, axe, heads, to, replace, stone, axe, heads, which, they, had, made, by, hand, in, a, labor, intensive, process, so, they, derived, substantial, benefits, from, the, trade, as, well, the, colonists, began, to, see, the, ill, effects, of, alcohol, on, natives, and, the, chiefs, objected, to, its, sale, and, trade, the, royal, proclamation, of, 1763, prohibited, sale, by, european, settlers, of, alcohol, to, the, indians, in, canada, following, the, british, takeover, of, the, territory, after, it, defeated, france, in, the, seven, years, war, known, as, the, french, and, indian, war, in, north, america, following, the, british, take, over, of, canada, from, france, the, control, of, the, fur, trade, in, north, america, became, consolidated, under, the, british, government, for, a, time, until, the, united, states, was, created, and, became, a, major, source, for, furs, being, shipped, to, europe, as, well, in, the, nineteenth, century, along, with, the, largely, unsettled, territory, of, russian, america, which, became, a, significant, source, of, furs, also, during, that, period, the, fur, trade, began, to, significantly, decline, starting, in, the, 1830s, following, changing, attitudes, and, fashions, in, europe, and, america, which, no, longer, centered, around, certain, articles, of, clothing, as, much, such, as, beaver, skin, hats, which, had, fueled, the, growing, demand, for, furs, driving, the, creation, and, expansion, of, the, fur, trade, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, although, new, trends, as, well, as, occasional, revivals, of, prior, fashions, would, cause, the, fur, trade, to, ebb, and, flow, right, up, to, the, present, often, the, political, benefits, of, the, fur, trade, became, more, important, than, the, economic, aspects, trade, was, a, way, to, forge, alliances, and, maintain, good, relations, between, different, cultures, the, fur, traders, were, men, with, capital, and, social, standing, often, younger, men, were, single, when, they, went, to, north, america, to, enter, the, fur, trade, they, made, marriages, or, cohabited, with, high, ranking, indian, women, of, similar, status, in, their, own, cultures, fur, trappers, and, other, workers, usually, had, relationships, with, lower, ranking, women, many, of, their, mixed, race, descendants, developed, their, own, culture, now, called, m, tis, in, canada, based, then, on, fur, trapping, and, other, activities, on, the, frontier, in, some, cases, both, native, american, and, european, american, cultures, excluded, the, mixed, race, descendants, if, the, native, americans, were, a, tribe, with, a, patrilineal, kinship, system, they, considered, children, born, to, a, white, father, to, be, white, in, a, type, of, hypodescent, classification, although, the, native, mother, and, tribe, might, care, for, them, the, europeans, tended, to, classify, children, of, native, women, as, native, regardless, of, the, father, similar, to, the, hypodescent, of, their, classification, of, the, children, of, slaves, the, m, tis, in, the, canadian, red, river, region, were, so, numerous, that, they, developed, a, creole, language, and, culture, since, the, late, 20th, century, the, m, tis, have, been, recognized, in, canada, as, a, first, nations, ethnic, group, the, interracial, relationships, resulted, in, a, two, tier, mixed, race, class, in, which, descendants, of, fur, traders, and, chiefs, achieved, prominence, in, some, canadian, social, political, and, economic, circles, lower, class, descendants, formed, the, majority, of, the, separate, m, tis, culture, based, on, hunting, trapping, and, farming, because, of, the, wealth, at, stake, different, european, american, governments, competed, with, various, native, societies, for, control, of, the, fur, trade, native, americans, sometimes, based, decisions, of, which, side, to, support, in, times, of, war, in, relation, to, which, people, had, provided, them, with, the, best, trade, goods, in, an, honest, manner, because, trade, was, so, politically, important, the, europeans, tried, to, regulate, it, in, hopes, often, futile, of, preventing, abuse, unscrupulous, traders, sometimes, cheated, natives, by, plying, them, with, alcohol, during, the, transaction, which, subsequently, aroused, resentment, and, often, resulted, in, violence, in, 1834, john, jacob, astor, who, had, created, the, huge, monopoly, of, the, american, fur, company, withdrew, from, the, fur, trade, he, could, see, the, decline, in, fur, animals, and, realized, the, market, was, changing, as, beaver, hats, went, out, of, style, expanding, european, settlement, displaced, native, communities, from, the, best, hunting, grounds, european, demand, for, furs, subsided, as, fashion, trends, shifted, the, native, americans, lifestyles, were, altered, by, the, trade, to, continue, obtaining, european, goods, on, which, they, had, become, dependent, and, to, pay, off, their, debts, they, often, resorted, to, selling, land, to, the, european, settlers, their, resentment, of, the, forced, sales, contributed, to, future, wars, after, the, united, states, became, independent, it, regulated, trading, with, native, americans, by, the, indian, intercourse, act, first, passed, on, july, 22, 1790, the, bureau, of, indian, affairs, issued, licenses, to, trade, in, the, indian, territory, in, 1834, this, was, defined, as, most, of, the, united, states, west, of, the, mississippi, river, where, mountain, men, and, traders, from, mexico, freely, operated, early, exploration, parties, were, often, fur, trading, expeditions, many, of, which, marked, the, first, recorded, instances, of, europeans, reaching, particular, regions, of, north, america, for, example, abraham, wood, sent, fur, trading, parties, on, exploring, expeditions, into, the, southern, appalachian, mountains, discovering, the, new, river, in, the, process, simon, fraser, was, a, fur, trader, who, explored, much, of, the, fraser, river, in, british, columbia, economic, historians, and, anthropologists, have, studied, the, fur, trade, s, important, role, in, early, north, american, economies, but, they, have, been, unable, to, agree, on, a, theoretical, framework, to, describe, native, economic, patterns, john, c, phillips, and, j, w, smurr, tied, the, fur, trade, to, an, imperial, struggle, for, power, positing, that, the, fur, trade, served, both, as, an, incentive, for, expanding, and, as, a, method, for, maintaining, dominance, dismissing, the, experience, of, individuals, the, authors, searched, for, connections, on, a, global, stage, that, revealed, its, high, political, and, economic, importance, e, e, rich, brought, the, economic, purview, down, a, level, focusing, on, the, role, of, trading, companies, and, their, men, as, the, ones, who, opened, up, much, of, canada, s, territories, instead, of, on, the, role, of, the, nation, state, in, opening, up, the, continent, rich, s, other, work, gets, to, the, heart, of, the, formalist, substantivist, debate, that, dominated, the, field, or, as, some, came, to, believe, muddied, it, historians, such, as, harold, innis, had, long, taken, the, formalist, position, especially, in, canadian, history, believing, that, neoclassical, economic, principles, affect, non, western, societies, just, as, they, do, western, ones, starting, in, the, 1950s, however, substantivists, such, as, karl, polanyi, challenged, these, ideas, arguing, instead, that, primitive, societies, could, engage, in, alternatives, to, traditional, western, market, trade, namely, gift, trade, and, administered, trade, rich, picked, up, these, arguments, in, an, influential, article, in, which, he, contended, that, indians, had, a, persistent, reluctance, to, accept, european, notions, or, the, basic, values, of, the, european, approach, and, that, english, economic, rules, did, not, apply, to, the, indian, trade, indians, were, savvy, traders, but, they, had, a, fundamentally, different, conception, of, property, which, confounded, their, european, trade, partners, abraham, rotstein, subsequently, fit, these, arguments, explicitly, into, polanyi, s, theoretical, framework, claiming, that, administered, trade, was, in, operation, at, the, bay, and, market, trade, in, london, arthur, j, ray, permanently, changed, the, direction, of, economic, studies, of, the, fur, trade, with, two, influential, works, that, presented, a, modified, formalist, position, in, between, the, extremes, of, innis, and, rotstein, this, trading, system, ray, explained, is, impossible, to, label, neatly, as, gift, trade, or, administered, trade, or, market, trade, since, it, embodies, elements, of, all, these, forms, indians, engaged, in, trade, for, a, variety, of, reasons, reducing, them, to, simple, economic, or, cultural, dichotomies, as, the, formalists, and, substantivists, had, done, was, a, fruitless, simplification, that, obscured, more, than, it, revealed, moreover, ray, used, trade, accounts, and, account, books, in, the, hudson, s, bay, company, s, archives, for, masterful, qualitative, analyses, and, pushed, the, boundaries, of, the, field, s, methodology, following, ray, s, position, bruce, m, white, also, helped, to, create, a, more, nuanced, picture, of, the, complex, ways, in, which, native, populations, fit, new, economic, relationships, into, existing, cultural, patterns, richard, white, while, admitting, that, the, formalist, substantivist, debate, was, old, and, now, tired, attempted, to, reinvigorate, the, substantivist, position, echoing, ray, s, moderate, position, that, cautioned, against, easy, simplifications, white, advanced, a, simple, argument, against, formalism, life, was, not, a, business, and, such, simplifications, only, distort, the, past, white, argued, instead, that, the, fur, trade, occupied, part, of, a, middle, ground, in, which, europeans, and, indians, sought, to, accommodate, their, cultural, differences, in, the, case, of, the, fur, trade, this, meant, that, the, french, were, forced, to, learn, from, the, political, and, cultural, meanings, with, which, indians, imbued, the, fur, trade, cooperation, not, domination, prevailed, according, to, the, fur, institute, of, canada, there, are, about, 60, 000, active, trappers, in, canada, based, on, trapping, licenses, of, whom, about, 25, 000, are, indigenous, peoples, the, fur, farming, industry, is, present, in, many, parts, of, canada, the, largest, producer, of, mink, and, foxes, is, nova, scotia, which, in, 2012, generated, revenues, of, nearly, 150, million, and, accounted, for, one, quarter, of, all, agricultural, production, in, the, province, in, 2000, there, were, 351, mink, farms, in, the, u, s, as, of, 2015, there, were, 176, 573, trappers, in, the, u, s, with, most, being, in, the, midwest, california, was, the, first, and, only, state, to, ban, trapping, for, commercial, and, recreation, purposes, in, 2015, the, north, american, fur, auction, nafa, occurs, four, times, a, year, and, attracts, buyers, from, around, the, world, according, to, the, northeast, association, of, fish, wildlife, agencies, at, present, approximately, 270, 000, families, in, the, united, states, and, canada, derive, some, of, their, income, from, fur, trapping, the, maritime, fur, trade, was, a, ship, based, fur, trade, system, that, focused, on, acquiring, furs, of, sea, otters, and, other, animals, from, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, and, natives, of, alaska, the, furs, were, mostly, traded, in, china, for, tea, silks, porcelain, and, other, chinese, goods, which, were, then, sold, in, europe, and, the, united, states, the, maritime, fur, trade, was, pioneered, by, the, russians, working, east, from, kamchatka, along, the, aleutian, islands, to, the, southern, coast, of, alaska, british, and, americans, entered, during, the, 1780s, focusing, on, what, is, now, the, coast, of, british, columbia, the, trade, boomed, around, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, a, long, period, of, decline, began, in, the, 1810s, as, the, sea, otter, population, was, depleted, the, maritime, fur, trade, diversified, and, was, transformed, tapping, new, markets, and, commodities, while, continuing, to, focus, on, the, northwest, coast, and, china, it, lasted, until, the, middle, to, late, 19th, century, russians, controlled, most, of, the, coast, of, what, is, now, alaska, during, the, entire, era, the, coast, south, of, alaska, saw, fierce, competition, between, and, among, british, and, american, trading, vessels, the, british, were, the, first, to, operate, in, the, southern, sector, but, were, unable, to, compete, against, the, americans, who, dominated, from, the, 1790s, to, the, 1830s, the, british, hudson, s, bay, company, entered, the, coast, trade, in, the, 1820s, with, the, intention, of, driving, the, americans, away, this, was, accomplished, by, about, 1840, in, its, late, period, the, maritime, fur, trade, was, largely, conducted, by, the, british, hudson, s, bay, company, and, the, russian, american, company, the, term, maritime, fur, trade, was, coined, by, historians, to, distinguish, the, coastal, ship, based, fur, trade, from, the, continental, land, based, fur, trade, of, for, example, the, north, west, company, and, the, american, fur, company, historically, the, maritime, fur, trade, was, not, known, by, that, name, rather, it, was, usually, called, the, north, west, coast, trade, or, north, west, trade, the, term, north, west, was, rarely, spelled, as, the, single, word, northwest, as, is, common, today, the, maritime, fur, trade, brought, the, pacific, northwest, coast, into, a, vast, new, international, trade, network, centered, on, the, north, pacific, ocean, global, in, scope, and, based, on, capitalism, but, not, for, the, most, part, on, colonialism, a, triangular, trade, network, emerged, linking, the, pacific, northwest, coast, china, the, hawaiian, islands, only, recently, discovered, by, the, western, world, europe, and, the, united, states, especially, new, england, the, trade, had, a, major, effect, on, the, indigenous, people, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, especially, the, aleut, tlingit, haida, nuu, chah, nulth, and, chinook, peoples, there, was, a, rapid, increase, of, wealth, among, the, northwest, coast, natives, along, with, increased, warfare, potlatching, slaving, depopulation, due, to, epidemic, disease, and, enhanced, importance, of, totems, and, traditional, nobility, crests, the, indigenous, culture, was, not, however, overwhelmed, it, rather, flourished, while, simultaneously, undergoing, rapid, change, the, use, of, chinook, jargon, arose, during, the, maritime, fur, trading, era, and, remains, a, distinctive, aspect, of, pacific, northwest, culture, native, hawaiian, society, was, similarly, affected, by, the, sudden, influx, of, western, wealth, and, technology, as, well, as, epidemic, diseases, the, trade, s, effect, on, china, and, europe, was, minimal, for, new, england, the, maritime, fur, trade, and, the, significant, profits, it, made, helped, revitalize, the, region, contributing, to, the, transformation, of, new, england, from, an, agrarian, to, an, industrial, society, the, wealth, generated, by, the, maritime, fur, trade, was, invested, in, industrial, development, especially, textile, manufacturing, the, new, england, textile, industry, in, turn, had, a, large, effect, on, slavery, in, the, united, states, increasing, the, demand, for, cotton, and, helping, make, possible, the, rapid, expansion, of, the, cotton, plantation, system, across, the, deep, south, the, most, profitable, furs, were, those, of, sea, otters, especially, the, northern, sea, otter, enhydra, lutris, kenyoni, which, inhabited, the, coastal, waters, between, the, columbia, river, to, the, south, and, cook, inlet, to, the, north, the, fur, of, the, californian, southern, sea, otter, e, l, nereis, was, less, highly, prized, and, thus, less, profitable, after, the, northern, sea, otter, was, hunted, to, local, extinction, maritime, fur, traders, shifted, to, california, until, the, southern, sea, otter, was, likewise, nearly, extinct, the, british, and, american, maritime, fur, traders, took, their, furs, to, the, chinese, port, of, guangzhou, canton, where, they, worked, within, the, established, canton, system, furs, from, russian, america, were, mostly, sold, to, china, via, the, mongolian, trading, town, of, kyakhta, which, had, been, opened, to, russian, trade, by, the, 1727, treaty, of, kyakhta, the, papers, from, the, north, american, fur, trade, conferences, which, are, held, approximately, every, five, years, not, only, provide, a, wealth, of, articles, on, disparate, aspects, of, the, fur, trade, but, also, can, be, taken, together, as, a, historiographical, overview, since, 1965, they, are, listed, chronologically, below, the, third, conference, held, in, 1978, is, of, particular, note, the, ninth, conference, which, was, held, in, st, louis, in, 2006, has, not, yet, published, its, papers
