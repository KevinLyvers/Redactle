the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, nafta, n, f, t, naf, t, spanish, tratado, de, libre, comercio, de, am, rica, del, norte, tlcan, french, accord, de, libre, change, nord, am, ricain, al, na, was, an, agreement, signed, by, canada, mexico, and, the, united, states, that, created, a, trilateral, trade, bloc, in, north, america, the, agreement, came, into, force, on, january, 1, 1994, and, superseded, the, 1988, canada, united, states, free, trade, agreement, between, the, united, states, and, canada, the, nafta, trade, bloc, formed, one, of, the, largest, trade, blocs, in, the, world, by, gross, domestic, product, the, impetus, for, a, north, american, free, trade, zone, began, with, u, s, president, ronald, reagan, who, made, the, idea, part, of, his, 1980, presidential, campaign, after, the, signing, of, the, canada, united, states, free, trade, agreement, in, 1988, the, administrations, of, u, s, president, george, h, w, bush, mexican, president, carlos, salinas, de, gortari, and, canadian, prime, minister, brian, mulroney, agreed, to, negotiate, what, became, nafta, each, submitted, the, agreement, for, ratification, in, their, respective, capitals, in, december, 1992, but, nafta, faced, significant, opposition, in, both, the, united, states, and, canada, all, three, countries, ratified, nafta, in, 1993, after, the, addition, of, two, side, agreements, the, north, american, agreement, on, labor, cooperation, naalc, and, the, north, american, agreement, on, environmental, cooperation, naaec, passage, of, nafta, resulted, in, the, elimination, or, reduction, of, barriers, to, trade, and, investment, between, the, united, states, canada, and, mexico, the, effects, of, the, agreement, regarding, issues, such, as, employment, the, environment, and, economic, growth, have, been, the, subject, of, political, disputes, most, economic, analyses, indicated, that, nafta, was, beneficial, to, the, north, american, economies, and, the, average, citizen, but, harmed, a, small, minority, of, workers, in, industries, exposed, to, trade, competition, economists, held, that, withdrawing, from, nafta, or, renegotiating, nafta, in, a, way, that, reestablished, trade, barriers, would, have, adversely, affected, the, u, s, economy, and, cost, jobs, however, mexico, would, have, been, much, more, severely, affected, by, job, loss, and, reduction, of, economic, growth, in, both, the, short, term, and, long, term, after, u, s, president, donald, trump, took, office, in, january, 2017, he, sought, to, replace, nafta, with, a, new, agreement, beginning, negotiations, with, canada, and, mexico, in, september, 2018, the, united, states, mexico, and, canada, reached, an, agreement, to, replace, nafta, with, the, united, states, mexico, canada, agreement, usmca, and, all, three, countries, had, ratified, it, by, march, 2020, nafta, remained, in, force, until, usmca, was, implemented, in, april, 2020, canada, and, mexico, notified, the, u, s, that, they, were, ready, to, implement, the, agreement, the, usmca, took, effect, on, july, 1, 2020, replacing, nafta, the, new, law, involved, only, small, changes, the, impetus, for, a, north, american, free, trade, zone, began, with, u, s, president, ronald, reagan, who, made, the, idea, part, of, his, campaign, when, he, announced, his, candidacy, for, the, presidency, in, november, 1979, canada, and, the, united, states, signed, the, canada, united, states, free, trade, agreement, fta, in, 1988, and, shortly, afterward, mexican, president, carlos, salinas, de, gortari, decided, to, approach, u, s, president, george, h, w, bush, to, propose, a, similar, agreement, in, an, effort, to, bring, in, foreign, investment, following, the, latin, american, debt, crisis, as, the, two, leaders, began, negotiating, the, canadian, government, under, prime, minister, brian, mulroney, feared, that, the, advantages, canada, had, gained, through, the, canada, us, fta, would, be, undermined, by, a, us, mexican, bilateral, agreement, and, asked, to, become, a, party, to, the, us, mexican, talks, following, diplomatic, negotiations, dating, back, to, 1990, the, leaders, of, the, three, nations, signed, the, agreement, in, their, respective, capitals, on, december, 17, 1992, the, signed, agreement, then, needed, to, be, ratified, by, each, nation, s, legislative, or, parliamentary, branch, the, earlier, canada, united, states, free, trade, agreement, had, been, controversial, and, divisive, in, canada, and, featured, as, an, issue, in, the, 1988, canadian, election, in, that, election, more, canadians, voted, for, anti, free, trade, parties, the, liberals, and, the, new, democrats, but, the, split, of, the, votes, between, the, two, parties, meant, that, the, pro, free, trade, progressive, conservatives, pcs, came, out, of, the, election, with, the, most, seats, and, so, took, power, mulroney, and, the, pcs, had, a, parliamentary, majority, and, easily, passed, the, 1987, canada, us, fta, and, nafta, bills, however, mulroney, was, replaced, as, conservative, leader, and, prime, minister, by, kim, campbell, campbell, led, the, pc, party, into, the, 1993, election, where, they, were, decimated, by, the, liberal, party, under, jean, chr, tien, who, campaigned, on, a, promise, to, renegotiate, or, abrogate, nafta, chr, tien, subsequently, negotiated, two, supplemental, agreements, with, bush, who, had, subverted, the, lac, advisory, process, and, worked, to, fast, track, the, signing, prior, to, the, end, of, his, term, ran, out, of, time, and, had, to, pass, the, required, ratification, and, signing, of, the, implementation, law, to, incoming, president, bill, clinton, before, sending, it, to, the, united, states, senate, clinton, added, two, side, agreements, the, north, american, agreement, on, labor, cooperation, naalc, and, the, north, american, agreement, on, environmental, cooperation, naaec, to, protect, workers, and, the, environment, and, to, also, allay, the, concerns, of, many, house, members, the, u, s, required, its, partners, to, adhere, to, environmental, practices, and, regulations, similar, to, its, own, after, much, consideration, and, emotional, discussion, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, passed, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, implementation, act, on, november, 17, 1993, 234, 200, the, agreement, s, supporters, included, 132, republicans, and, 102, democrats, the, bill, passed, the, senate, on, november, 20, 1993, 61, 38, senate, supporters, were, 34, republicans, and, 27, democrats, republican, representative, david, dreier, of, california, a, strong, proponent, of, nafta, since, the, reagan, administration, played, a, leading, role, in, mobilizing, support, for, the, agreement, among, republicans, in, congress, and, across, the, country, chicago, congressman, luis, guti, rrez, in, particular, was, a, vocal, opponent, of, nafta, ultimately, voting, against, the, measure, because, of, what, he, considered, its, failure, to, sufficiently, provide, for, displaced, worker, retraining, protections, against, american, job, loss, and, protections, of, collective, bargaining, rights, for, mexican, workers, he, criticized, the, role, of, rahm, emanuel, in, particular, for, the, deficiencies, the, u, s, required, its, partners, to, adhere, to, environmental, practices, and, regulations, similar, to, its, own, clinton, signed, it, into, law, on, december, 8, 1993, the, agreement, went, into, effect, on, january, 1, 1994, at, the, signing, ceremony, clinton, recognized, four, individuals, for, their, efforts, in, accomplishing, the, historic, trade, deal, vice, president, al, gore, chairwoman, of, the, council, of, economic, advisers, laura, tyson, director, of, the, national, economic, council, robert, rubin, and, republican, congressman, david, dreier, clinton, also, stated, that, nafta, means, jobs, american, jobs, and, good, paying, american, jobs, if, i, didn, t, believe, that, i, wouldn, t, support, this, agreement, nafta, replaced, the, previous, canada, us, fta, nafta, tlcan, in, spanish, was, approved, by, the, mexican, senate, on, november, 22, 1993, and, was, published, in, the, official, gazette, of, the, federation, on, december, 8, 1993, the, decree, implementing, nafta, and, the, various, changes, to, accommodate, nafta, in, mexican, law, was, promulgated, on, december, 14, 1993, with, entry, into, force, on, january, 1, 1994, the, goal, of, nafta, was, to, eliminate, barriers, to, trade, and, investment, between, the, united, states, canada, and, mexico, the, implementation, of, nafta, on, january, 1, 1994, brought, the, immediate, elimination, of, tariffs, on, more, than, one, half, of, mexico, s, exports, to, the, u, s, and, more, than, one, third, of, u, s, exports, to, mexico, within, 10, years, of, the, implementation, of, the, agreement, all, u, s, mexico, tariffs, were, to, be, eliminated, except, for, some, u, s, agricultural, exports, to, mexico, to, be, phased, out, within, 15, years, most, u, s, canada, trade, was, already, duty, free, nafta, also, sought, to, eliminate, non, tariff, trade, barriers, and, to, protect, the, intellectual, property, rights, on, traded, products, chapter, 20, provided, a, procedure, for, the, international, resolution, of, disputes, over, the, application, and, interpretation, of, nafta, it, was, modeled, after, chapter, 69, of, the, canada, united, states, free, trade, agreement, nafta, is, in, part, implemented, by, technical, working, groups, composed, of, government, officials, from, each, of, the, three, partner, nations, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, implementation, act, made, some, changes, to, the, copyright, law, of, the, united, states, foreshadowing, the, uruguay, round, agreements, act, of, 1994, by, restoring, copyright, within, the, nafta, nations, on, certain, motion, pictures, which, had, entered, the, public, domain, the, clinton, administration, negotiated, a, side, agreement, on, the, environment, with, canada, and, mexico, the, north, american, agreement, on, environmental, cooperation, naaec, which, led, to, the, creation, of, the, commission, for, environmental, cooperation, cec, in, 1994, to, alleviate, concerns, that, nafta, the, first, regional, trade, agreement, between, a, developing, country, and, two, developed, countries, would, have, negative, environmental, impacts, the, commission, was, mandated, to, conduct, ongoing, ex, post, environmental, assessment, it, created, one, of, the, first, ex, post, frameworks, for, environmental, assessment, of, trade, liberalization, designed, to, produce, a, body, of, evidence, with, respect, to, the, initial, hypotheses, about, nafta, and, the, environment, such, as, the, concern, that, nafta, would, create, a, race, to, the, bottom, in, environmental, regulation, among, the, three, countries, or, that, nafta, would, pressure, governments, to, increase, their, environmental, protections, the, cec, has, held, four, symposia, to, evaluate, the, environmental, impacts, of, nafta, and, commissioned, 47, papers, on, the, subject, from, leading, independent, experts, proponents, of, nafta, in, the, united, states, emphasized, that, the, pact, was, a, free, trade, not, an, economic, community, agreement, the, freedom, of, movement, it, establishes, for, goods, services, and, capital, did, not, extend, to, labor, in, proposing, what, no, other, comparable, agreement, had, attempted, to, open, industrialized, countries, to, a, major, third, world, country, nafta, eschewed, the, creation, of, common, social, and, employment, policies, the, regulation, of, the, labor, market, and, or, the, workplace, remained, the, exclusive, preserve, of, the, national, governments, a, side, agreement, on, enforcement, of, existing, domestic, labor, law, concluded, in, august, 1993, the, north, american, agreement, on, labour, cooperation, naalc, was, highly, circumscribed, focused, on, health, and, safety, standards, and, on, child, labor, law, it, excluded, issues, of, collective, bargaining, and, its, so, called, teeth, were, accessible, only, at, the, end, of, a, long, and, tortuous, disputes, process, commitments, to, enforce, existing, labor, law, also, raised, issues, of, democratic, practice, the, canadian, anti, nafta, coalition, pro, canada, network, suggested, that, guarantees, of, minimum, standards, would, be, meaningless, without, broad, democratic, reforms, in, the, courts, the, unions, and, the, government, later, assessment, however, did, suggest, that, naalc, s, principles, and, complaint, mechanisms, did, create, new, space, for, advocates, to, build, coalitions, and, take, concrete, action, to, articulate, challenges, to, the, status, quo, and, advance, workers, interests, from, the, earliest, negotiation, agriculture, was, a, controversial, topic, within, nafta, as, it, has, been, with, almost, all, free, trade, agreements, signed, within, the, wto, framework, agriculture, was, the, only, section, that, was, not, negotiated, trilaterally, instead, three, separate, agreements, were, signed, between, each, pair, of, parties, the, canada, u, s, agreement, contained, significant, restrictions, and, tariff, quotas, on, agricultural, products, mainly, sugar, dairy, and, poultry, products, whereas, the, mexico, u, s, pact, allowed, for, a, wider, liberalization, within, a, framework, of, phase, out, periods, it, was, the, first, north, south, fta, on, agriculture, to, be, signed, nafta, established, the, canamex, corridor, for, road, transport, between, canada, and, mexico, also, proposed, for, use, by, rail, pipeline, and, fiber, optic, telecommunications, infrastructure, this, became, a, high, priority, corridor, under, the, u, s, intermodal, surface, transportation, efficiency, act, of, 1991, another, contentious, issue, was, the, investor, state, dispute, settlement, obligations, contained, in, chapter, 11, of, nafta, chapter, 11, allowed, corporations, or, individuals, to, sue, mexico, canada, or, the, united, states, for, compensation, when, actions, taken, by, those, governments, or, by, those, for, whom, they, are, responsible, at, international, law, such, as, provincial, state, or, municipal, governments, violated, international, law, this, chapter, has, been, criticized, by, groups, in, the, united, states, mexico, and, canada, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, not, taking, into, account, important, social, and, environmental, considerations, in, canada, several, groups, including, the, council, of, canadians, challenged, the, constitutionality, of, chapter, 11, they, lost, at, the, trial, level, and, the, subsequent, appeal, methanex, corporation, a, canadian, corporation, filed, a, us, 970, million, suit, against, the, united, states, methanex, claimed, that, a, california, ban, on, methyl, tert, butyl, ether, mtbe, a, substance, that, had, found, its, way, into, many, wells, in, the, state, was, hurtful, to, the, corporation, s, sales, of, methanol, the, claim, was, rejected, and, the, company, was, ordered, to, pay, us, 3, million, to, the, u, s, government, in, costs, based, on, the, following, reasoning, but, as, a, matter, of, general, international, law, a, non, discriminatory, regulation, for, a, public, purpose, which, is, enacted, in, accordance, with, due, process, and, which, affects, inter, alios, a, foreign, investor, or, investment, is, not, deemed, expropriatory, and, compensable, unless, specific, commitments, had, been, given, by, the, regulating, government, to, the, then, putative, foreign, investor, contemplating, investment, that, the, government, would, refrain, from, such, regulation, in, another, case, metalclad, an, american, corporation, was, awarded, us, 15, 6, million, from, mexico, after, a, mexican, municipality, refused, a, construction, permit, for, the, hazardous, waste, landfill, it, intended, to, construct, in, guadalc, zar, san, luis, potos, the, construction, had, already, been, approved, by, the, federal, government, with, various, environmental, requirements, imposed, see, paragraph, 48, of, the, tribunal, decision, the, nafta, panel, found, that, the, municipality, did, not, have, the, authority, to, ban, construction, on, the, basis, of, its, environmental, concerns, in, eli, lilly, and, company, v, government, of, canada, the, plaintiff, presented, a, us, 500, million, claim, for, the, way, canada, requires, usefulness, in, its, drug, patent, legislation, apotex, sued, the, u, s, for, us, 520, million, because, of, opportunity, it, says, it, lost, in, an, fda, generic, drug, decision, lone, pine, resources, inc, v, government, of, canada, filed, a, us, 250, million, claim, against, canada, accusing, it, of, arbitrary, capricious, and, illegal, behaviour, because, quebec, intends, to, prevent, fracking, exploration, under, the, st, lawrence, seaway, lone, pine, resources, is, incorporated, in, delaware, but, headquartered, in, calgary, and, had, an, initial, public, offering, on, the, nyse, may, 25, 2011, of, 15, million, shares, each, for, 13, which, raised, us, 195, million, barutciski, acknowledged, that, nafta, and, other, investor, protection, treaties, create, an, anomaly, in, that, canadian, companies, that, have, also, seen, their, permits, rescinded, by, the, very, same, quebec, legislation, which, expressly, forbids, the, paying, of, compensation, do, not, have, the, right, to, pursue, a, nafta, claim, and, that, winning, compensation, in, canadian, courts, for, domestic, companies, in, this, case, would, be, more, difficult, since, the, constitution, puts, property, rights, in, provincial, hands, a, treaty, with, china, would, extend, similar, rights, to, chinese, investors, including, soes, nafta, s, chapter, 19, was, a, trade, dispute, mechanism, which, subjects, antidumping, and, countervailing, duty, ad, cvd, determinations, to, binational, panel, review, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, conventional, judicial, review, for, example, in, the, united, states, review, of, agency, decisions, imposing, antidumping, and, countervailing, duties, are, normally, heard, before, the, u, s, court, of, international, trade, an, article, iii, court, nafta, parties, however, had, the, option, of, appealing, the, decisions, to, binational, panels, composed, of, five, citizens, from, the, two, relevant, nafta, countries, the, panelists, were, generally, lawyers, experienced, in, international, trade, law, since, nafta, did, not, include, substantive, provisions, concerning, ad, cvd, the, panel, was, charged, with, determining, whether, final, agency, determinations, involving, ad, cvd, conformed, with, the, country, s, domestic, law, chapter, 19, was, an, anomaly, in, international, dispute, settlement, since, it, did, not, apply, international, law, but, required, a, panel, composed, of, individuals, from, many, countries, to, re, examine, the, application, of, one, country, s, domestic, law, a, chapter, 19, panel, was, expected, to, examine, whether, the, agency, s, determination, was, supported, by, substantial, evidence, this, standard, assumed, significant, deference, to, the, domestic, agency, some, of, the, most, controversial, trade, disputes, in, recent, years, such, as, the, u, s, canada, softwood, lumber, dispute, have, been, litigated, before, chapter, 19, panels, decisions, by, chapter, 19, panels, could, be, challenged, before, a, nafta, extraordinary, challenge, committee, however, an, extraordinary, challenge, committee, did, not, function, as, an, ordinary, appeal, under, nafta, it, only, vacated, or, remanded, a, decision, if, the, decision, involveed, a, significant, and, material, error, that, threatens, the, integrity, of, the, nafta, dispute, settlement, system, since, january, 2006, no, nafta, party, had, successfully, challenged, a, chapter, 19, panel, s, decision, before, an, extraordinary, challenge, committee, the, roster, of, nafta, adjudicators, included, many, retired, judges, such, as, alice, desjardins, john, maxwell, evans, constance, hunt, john, richard, arlin, adams, susan, getzendanner, george, c, pratt, charles, b, renfrew, and, sandra, day, o, connor, in, 2008, canadian, exports, to, the, united, states, and, mexico, were, at, 381, 3, billion, with, imports, at, 245, 1, billion, according, to, a, 2004, article, by, university, of, toronto, economist, daniel, trefler, nafta, produced, a, significant, net, benefit, to, canada, in, 2003, with, long, term, productivity, increasing, by, up, to, 15, percent, in, industries, that, experienced, the, deepest, tariff, cuts, while, the, contraction, of, low, productivity, plants, reduced, employment, up, to, 12, percent, of, existing, positions, these, job, losses, lasted, less, than, a, decade, overall, unemployment, in, canada, has, fallen, since, the, passage, of, the, act, commenting, on, this, trade, off, trefler, said, that, the, critical, question, in, trade, policy, is, to, understand, how, freer, trade, can, be, implemented, in, an, industrialized, economy, in, a, way, that, recognizes, both, the, long, run, gains, and, the, short, term, adjustment, costs, borne, by, workers, and, others, a, study, in, 2007, found, that, nafta, had, a, substantial, impact, on, international, trade, volumes, but, a, modest, effect, on, prices, and, welfare, according, to, a, 2012, study, with, reduced, nafta, trade, tariffs, trade, with, the, united, states, and, mexico, only, increased, by, a, modest, 11, in, canada, compared, to, an, increase, of, 41, for, the, u, s, and, 118, for, mexico, 3, moreover, the, u, s, and, mexico, benefited, more, from, the, tariff, reductions, component, with, welfare, increases, of, 0, 08, and, 1, 31, respectively, with, canada, experiencing, a, decrease, of, 0, 06, 4, according, to, a, 2017, report, by, the, new, york, city, based, public, policy, think, tank, report, council, on, foreign, relations, cfr, bilateral, trade, in, agricultural, products, tripled, in, size, from, 1994, to, 2017, and, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, largest, economic, effects, of, nafta, on, u, s, canada, trade, with, canada, becoming, the, u, s, agricultural, sectors, leading, importer, canadian, fears, of, losing, manufacturing, jobs, to, the, united, states, did, not, materialize, with, manufacturing, employment, holding, steady, however, with, canada, s, labour, productivity, levels, at, 72, of, u, s, levels, the, hopes, of, closing, the, productivity, gap, between, the, two, countries, were, also, not, realized, according, to, a, 2018, sierra, club, report, canada, s, commitments, under, nafta, and, the, paris, agreement, conflicted, the, paris, commitments, were, voluntary, and, nafta, s, were, compulsory, according, to, a, 2018, report, by, gordon, laxter, published, by, the, council, of, canadians, nafta, s, article, 605, energy, proportionality, rule, ensures, that, americans, had, virtually, unlimited, first, access, to, most, of, canada, s, oil, and, natural, gas, and, canada, could, not, reduce, oil, natural, gas, and, electricity, exports, 74, its, oil, and, 52, its, natural, gas, to, the, u, s, even, if, canada, was, experiencing, shortages, these, provisions, that, seemed, logical, when, nafta, was, signed, in, 1993, are, no, longer, appropriate, 4, the, council, of, canadians, promoted, environmental, protection, and, was, against, nafta, s, role, in, encouraging, development, of, the, tar, sands, and, fracking, us, president, donald, trump, angered, by, canada, s, dairy, tax, of, almost, 300, threatened, to, leave, canada, out, of, the, nafta, since, 1972, canada, has, been, operating, on, a, supply, management, system, which, the, united, states, is, attempting, to, pressure, it, out, of, specifically, focusing, on, the, dairy, industry, however, this, has, not, yet, taken, place, as, quebec, which, holds, approximately, half, the, country, s, dairy, farms, still, supports, supply, management, maquiladoras, mexican, assembly, plants, that, take, in, imported, components, and, produce, goods, for, export, became, the, landmark, of, trade, in, mexico, they, moved, to, mexico, from, the, united, states, hence, the, debate, over, the, loss, of, american, jobs, income, in, the, maquiladora, sector, had, increased, 15, 5, since, the, implementation, of, nafta, in, 1994, other, sectors, also, benefited, from, the, free, trade, agreement, and, the, share, of, exports, to, the, u, s, from, non, border, states, increased, in, the, last, five, years, while, the, share, of, exports, from, border, states, decreased, this, allowed, for, rapid, growth, in, non, border, metropolitan, areas, such, as, toluca, le, n, and, puebla, which, were, all, larger, in, population, than, tijuana, ciudad, ju, rez, and, reynosa, the, overall, effect, of, the, mexico, u, s, agricultural, agreement, is, disputed, mexico, did, not, invest, in, the, infrastructure, necessary, for, competition, such, as, efficient, railroads, and, highways, this, resulted, in, more, difficult, living, conditions, for, the, country, s, poor, mexico, s, agricultural, exports, increased, 9, 4, percent, annually, between, 1994, and, 2001, while, imports, increased, by, only, 6, 9, percent, a, year, during, the, same, period, one, of, the, most, affected, agricultural, sectors, was, the, meat, industry, mexico, went, from, a, small, player, in, the, pre, 1994, u, s, export, market, to, the, second, largest, importer, of, u, s, agricultural, products, in, 2004, and, nafta, may, have, been, a, major, catalyst, for, this, change, free, trade, removed, the, hurdles, that, impeded, business, between, the, two, countries, so, mexico, provided, a, growing, market, for, meat, for, the, u, s, and, increased, sales, and, profits, for, the, u, s, meat, industry, a, coinciding, noticeable, increase, in, the, mexican, per, capita, gdp, greatly, changed, meat, consumption, patterns, as, per, capita, meat, consumption, grew, one, of, concerns, raised, by, the, implementation, of, nafta, in, mexico, was, wealth, inequality, national, bureau, of, economic, research, found, that, nafta, increased, the, wage, gap, between, the, lowest, and, highest, earners, directly, affecting, wealth, inequality, according, to, global, trade, watch, under, nafta, mexico, observed, a, decline, in, real, average, annual, wages, with, this, decline, mainly, affecting, those, who, earned, the, least, the, real, average, wage, of, minimum, wage, workers, decreased, by, 14, percent, gtw, concluded, that, inflation, adjusted, wages, for, virtually, every, category, of, mexican, worker, decreased, over, nafta, s, first, six, years, even, as, hundreds, of, thousands, of, manufacturing, jobs, were, being, shifted, from, the, united, states, to, mexico, similar, effects, were, found, in, a, study, published, in, the, international, journal, of, economic, sciences, which, found, that, nafta, had, a, direct, impact, on, wage, inequality, in, mexico, from, 1994, onwards, the, wage, gap, between, the, poorest, and, the, richest, workers, noticeably, increased, production, of, corn, in, mexico, increased, since, nafta, however, internal, demand, for, corn, had, increased, beyond, mexico, s, supply, to, the, point, where, imports, became, necessary, far, beyond, the, quotas, mexico, originally, negotiated, zahniser, coyle, pointed, out, that, corn, prices, in, mexico, adjusted, for, international, prices, have, drastically, decreased, but, through, a, program, of, subsidies, expanded, by, former, president, vicente, fox, production, remained, stable, since, 2000, reducing, agricultural, subsidies, especially, corn, subsidies, was, suggested, as, a, way, to, reduce, harm, to, mexican, farmers, a, 2001, journal, of, economic, perspectives, review, of, the, existing, literature, found, that, nafta, was, a, net, benefit, to, mexico, by, 2003, 80, of, the, commerce, in, mexico, was, executed, only, with, the, u, s, the, commercial, sales, surplus, combined, with, the, deficit, with, the, rest, of, the, world, created, a, dependency, in, mexico, s, exports, these, effects, were, evident, in, the, 2001, recession, which, resulted, in, either, a, low, rate, or, a, negative, rate, in, mexico, s, exports, a, 2015, study, found, that, mexico, s, welfare, increased, by, 1, 31, as, a, result, of, the, nafta, tariff, reductions, and, that, mexico, s, intra, bloc, trade, increased, by, 118, inequality, and, poverty, fell, in, the, most, globalization, affected, regions, of, mexico, 2013, and, 2015, studies, showed, that, mexican, small, farmers, benefited, more, from, nafta, than, large, scale, farmers, nafta, had, also, been, credited, with, the, rise, of, the, mexican, middle, class, a, tufts, university, study, found, that, nafta, lowered, the, average, cost, of, basic, necessities, in, mexico, by, up, to, 50, this, price, reduction, increased, cash, on, hand, for, many, mexican, families, allowing, mexico, to, graduate, more, engineers, than, germany, each, year, growth, in, new, sales, orders, indicated, an, increase, in, demand, for, manufactured, products, which, resulted, in, expansion, of, production, and, a, higher, employment, rate, to, satisfy, the, increment, in, the, demand, the, growth, in, the, maquiladora, industry, and, in, the, manufacturing, industry, was, of, 4, 7, in, august, 2016, three, quarters, of, the, imports, and, exports, are, with, the, u, s, tufts, university, political, scientist, daniel, w, drezner, argued, that, nafta, made, it, easier, for, mexico, to, transform, to, a, real, democracy, and, become, a, country, that, views, itself, as, north, american, this, has, boosted, cooperation, between, the, united, states, and, mexico, economists, generally, agreed, that, the, united, states, economy, benefited, overall, from, nafta, as, it, increased, trade, in, a, 2012, survey, of, the, initiative, on, global, markets, economic, experts, panel, 95, of, the, participants, said, that, on, average, u, s, citizens, benefited, from, nafta, while, none, said, that, nafta, hurt, us, citizens, on, average, a, 2001, journal, of, economic, perspectives, review, found, that, nafta, was, a, net, benefit, to, the, united, states, a, 2015, study, found, that, us, welfare, increased, by, 0, 08, as, a, result, of, nafta, tariff, reductions, and, that, us, intra, bloc, trade, increased, by, 41, a, 2014, study, on, the, effects, of, nafta, on, us, trade, jobs, and, investment, found, that, between, 1993, and, 2013, the, us, trade, deficit, with, mexico, and, canada, increased, from, 17, 0, to, 177, 2, billion, displacing, 851, 700, us, jobs, in, 2015, the, congressional, research, service, concluded, that, the, net, overall, effect, of, nafta, on, the, us, economy, appears, to, have, been, relatively, modest, primarily, because, trade, with, canada, and, mexico, accounts, for, a, small, percentage, of, us, gdp, however, there, were, worker, and, firm, adjustment, costs, as, the, three, countries, adjusted, to, more, open, trade, and, investment, among, their, economies, the, report, also, estimated, that, nafta, added, 80, billion, to, the, us, economy, since, its, implementation, equivalent, to, a, 0, 5, increase, in, us, gdp, the, us, chamber, of, commerce, credited, nafta, with, increasing, u, s, trade, in, goods, and, services, with, canada, and, mexico, from, 337, billion, in, 1993, to, 1, 2, trillion, in, 2011, while, the, afl, cio, blamed, the, agreement, for, sending, 700, 000, american, manufacturing, jobs, to, mexico, over, that, time, university, of, california, san, diego, economics, professor, gordon, hanson, said, that, nafta, helped, the, us, compete, against, china, and, therefore, saved, us, jobs, while, some, jobs, were, lost, to, mexico, as, a, result, of, nafta, considerably, more, would, have, been, lost, to, china, if, not, for, nafta, the, us, had, a, trade, surplus, with, nafta, countries, of, 28, 3, billion, for, services, in, 2009, and, a, trade, deficit, of, 94, 6, billion, 36, 4, annual, increase, for, goods, in, 2010, this, trade, deficit, accounted, for, 26, 8, of, all, us, goods, trade, deficit, a, 2018, study, of, global, trade, published, by, the, center, for, international, relations, identified, irregularities, in, the, patterns, of, trade, of, nafta, ecosystem, using, network, theory, analytical, techniques, the, study, showed, that, the, us, trade, balance, was, influenced, by, tax, avoidance, opportunities, provided, in, ireland, a, study, published, in, the, august, 2008, issue, of, the, american, journal, of, agricultural, economics, found, nafta, increased, us, agricultural, exports, to, mexico, and, canada, even, though, most, of, the, increase, occurred, a, decade, after, its, ratification, the, study, focused, on, the, effects, that, gradual, phase, in, periods, in, regional, trade, agreements, including, nafta, have, on, trade, flows, most, of, the, increases, in, members, agricultural, trade, which, was, only, recently, brought, under, the, purview, of, the, world, trade, organization, was, due, to, very, high, trade, barriers, before, nafta, or, other, regional, trade, agreements, the, u, s, foreign, direct, investment, fdi, in, nafta, countries, stock, was, 327, 5, billion, in, 2009, latest, data, available, up, 8, 8, from, 2008, the, us, direct, investment, in, nafta, countries, was, in, non, bank, holding, companies, and, the, manufacturing, finance, insurance, and, mining, sectors, the, foreign, direct, investment, of, canada, and, mexico, in, the, united, states, stock, was, 237, 2, billion, in, 2009, the, latest, data, available, up, 16, 5, from, 2008, in, their, may, 24, 2017, report, the, congressional, research, service, crs, wrote, that, the, economic, impacts, of, nafta, on, the, u, s, economy, were, modest, in, a, 2015, report, the, congressional, research, service, summarized, multiple, studies, as, follows, in, reality, nafta, did, not, cause, the, huge, job, losses, feared, by, the, critics, or, the, large, economic, gains, predicted, by, supporters, the, net, overall, effect, of, nafta, on, the, u, s, economy, appears, to, have, been, relatively, modest, primarily, because, trade, with, canada, and, mexico, accounts, for, a, small, percentage, of, u, s, gdp, however, there, were, worker, and, firm, adjustment, costs, as, the, three, countries, adjusted, to, more, open, trade, and, investment, among, their, economies, 2, many, american, small, businesses, depended, on, exporting, their, products, to, canada, or, mexico, under, nafta, according, to, the, u, s, trade, representative, this, trade, supported, over, 140, 000, small, and, medium, sized, businesses, in, the, us, according, to, university, of, california, berkeley, professor, of, economics, brad, delong, nafta, had, an, insignificant, impact, on, us, manufacturing, the, adverse, impact, on, manufacturing, was, exaggerated, in, us, political, discourse, according, to, delong, and, harvard, economist, dani, rodrik, according, to, a, 2013, article, by, jeff, faux, published, by, the, economic, policy, institute, california, texas, michigan, and, other, states, with, high, concentrations, of, manufacturing, jobs, were, most, affected, by, job, loss, due, to, nafta, according, to, a, 2011, article, by, epi, economist, robert, scott, about, 682, 900, u, s, jobs, were, lost, or, displaced, as, a, result, of, the, trade, agreement, more, recent, studies, agreed, with, reports, by, the, congressional, research, service, that, nafta, only, had, a, modest, impact, on, manufacturing, employment, and, automation, explained, 87, of, the, losses, in, manufacturing, jobs, according, to, a, study, in, the, journal, of, international, economics, nafta, reduced, pollution, emitted, by, the, us, manufacturing, sector, on, average, nearly, two, thirds, of, the, reductions, in, coarse, particulate, matter, pm, 10, and, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, emissions, from, the, u, s, manufacturing, sector, between, 1994, and, 1998, can, be, attributed, to, trade, liberalization, following, nafta, according, to, the, sierra, club, nafta, contributed, to, large, scale, export, oriented, farming, which, led, to, the, increased, use, of, fossil, fuels, pesticides, and, gmo, nafta, also, contributed, to, environmentally, destructive, mining, practices, in, mexico, it, prevented, canada, from, effectively, regulating, its, tar, sands, industry, and, created, new, legal, avenues, for, transnational, corporations, to, fight, environmental, legislation, in, some, cases, environmental, policy, was, neglected, in, the, wake, of, trade, liberalization, in, other, cases, nafta, s, measures, for, investment, protection, such, as, chapter, 11, and, measures, against, non, tariff, trade, barriers, threatened, to, discourage, more, vigorous, environmental, policy, the, most, serious, overall, increases, in, pollution, due, to, nafta, were, found, in, the, base, metals, sector, the, mexican, petroleum, sector, and, the, transportation, equipment, sector, in, the, united, states, and, mexico, but, not, in, canada, according, to, the, department, of, homeland, security, yearbook, of, immigration, statistics, during, fiscal, year, 2006, october, 2005, september, 2006, 73, 880, foreign, professionals, 64, 633, canadians, and, 9, 247, mexicans, were, admitted, into, the, united, states, for, temporary, employment, under, nafta, i, e, in, the, tn,

during, the, year, a, discrepancy, may, be, caused, by, some, tn, entrants, leaving, the, country, or, changing, status, before, their, three, year, admission, period, has, expired, while, other, immigrants, admitted, earlier, may, change, their, status, to, tn, or, td, or, extend, tn, status, granted, earlier, according, to, the, international, organization, for, migration, deaths, of, migrants, have, been, on, the, rise, worldwide, with, 5, 604, deaths, in, 2016, an, increased, number, of, undocumented, farmworkers, in, california, may, be, due, to, the, initial, passing, of, nafta, canadian, authorities, estimated, that, on, december, 1, 2006, 24, 830, u, s, citizens, and, 15, 219, mexican, citizens, were, in, canada, as, foreign, workers, these, numbers, include, both, entrants, under, nafta, and, those, who, entered, under, other, provisions, of, canadian, immigration, law, new, entries, of, foreign, workers, in, 2006, totalled, 16, 841, u, s, citizens, and, 13,

for, factory, workers, and, you, can, move, your, factory, south, of, the, border, pay, a, dollar, an, hour, for, labor, have, no, health, care, that, s, the, most, expensive, single, element, in, making, a, car, have, no, environmental, controls, no, pollution, controls, and, no, retirement, and, you, don, t, care, about, anything, but, making, money, there, will, be, a, giant, sucking, sound, going, south, when, jobs, come, up, from, a, dollar, an, hour, to, six, dollars, an, hour, and, ours, go, down, to, six, dollars, an, hour, and, then, it, s, leveled, again, but, in, the, meantime, you, ve, wrecked, the, country, with, these, kinds, of, deals, perot, ultimately, lost, the, election, and, the, winner, bill, clinton, supported, nafta, which, went, into, effect, on, january, 1, 1994, in, 1996, the, gasoline, additive, mmt, was, brought, to, canada, by, ethyl, corporation, an, american, company, when, the, canadian, federal, government, banned, imports, of, the, additive, the, american, company, brought, a, claim, under, nafta, chapter, 11, seeking, us, 201, million, from, the, canadian, federal, government, as, well, as, the, canadian, provinces, under, the, agreement, on, internal, trade, ait, they, argued, that, the, additive, had, not, been, conclusively, linked, to, any, health, dangers, and, that, the, prohibition, was, damaging, to, their, company, following, a, finding, that, the, ban, was, a, violation, of, the, ait, the, canadian, federal, government, repealed, the, ban, and, settled, with, the, american, company, for, us, 13, million,

disappointed, with, the, decision, but, it, will, have, no, impact, on, the, anti, dumping, and, countervailing, duty, orders, on, july, 21, 2006, the, united, states, court, of, international, trade, found, that, imposition, of, the, duties, was, contrary, to, u, s, law, on, october, 30, 2007, american, citizens, marvin, and, elaine, gottlieb, filed, a, notice, of, intent, to, submit, a, claim,

change, the, tax, rate, on, income, trusts, in, the, energy, sector, on, april, 29, 2009, a, determination, was, made, that, this, change, in, tax, law, was, not, expropriation, several, studies, rejected, nafta, responsibility, for, depressing, the, incomes, of, poor, corn, farmers, the, trend, existed, more, than, a, decade, before, nafta, existed, also, maize, production, increased, after, 1994, and, there, wasn, t, a, measurable, impact, on, the, price, of, mexican, corn, because, of, subsidized, corn, from, the, united, states, the, studies, agreed, that, the, abolition, of, u, s, agricultural, subsidies, would, benefit, mexican, farmers, preparations, for, nafta, included, cancellation, of, article, 27, of, mexico, s, constitution, the, cornerstone, of, emiliano, zapata, s, revolution, in, 1910, 1919, under, the, historic, article, 27, indigenous, communal, landholdings, were, protected, from, sale, or, privatization, however, this, barrier, to, investment, was, incompatible, with, nafta, indigenous, farmers, feared, the, loss, of, their, remaining, land, and, cheap, imports, substitutes, from, the, us, the, zapatistas, labelled, nafta, a, death, sentence, to, indigenous, communities, all, over, mexico, and, later, declared, war, on, the, mexican, state, on, january, 1, 1994, the, day, nafta, came, into, force, in, a, 60, minutes, interview, in, september, 2015, 2016, presidential, candidate, donald, trump, called, nafta, the, single, worst, trade, deal, ever, approved, in, and, said, that, if, elected, he, would, either, renegotiate, it, or, we, will, break, it, juan, pablo, casta, n, president, of, the, trade, group, consejo, coordinador, empresarial, expressed, concern, about, renegotiation, and, the, willingness, to, focus, on, the, car, industry, a, range, of, trade, experts, said, that, pulling, out, of, nafta, would, have, a, range, of, unintended, consequences, for, the, united, states, including, reduced, access, to, its, biggest, export, markets, a, reduction, in, economic, growth, and, higher, prices, for, gasoline, cars, fruits, and, vegetables, members, of, the, private, initiative, in, mexico, noted, that, to, eliminate, nafta, many, laws, must, be, adapted, by, the, u, s, congress, the, move, would, also, eventually, result, in, legal, complaints, by, the, world, trade, organization, the, washington, post, noted, that, a, congressional, research, service, review, of, academic, literature, concluded, that, the, net, overall, effect, of, nafta, on, the, u, s, economy, appears, to, have, been, relatively, modest, primarily, because, trade, with, canada, and, mexico, accounts, for, a, small, percentage, of, u, s, gdp, democratic, candidate, bernie, sanders, opposing, the, trans, pacific, partnership, trade, agreement, called, it, a, continuation, of, other, disastrous, trade, agreements, like, nafta, cafta, and, permanent, normal, trade, relations, with, china, he, believes, that, free, trade, agreements, have, caused, a, loss, of, american, jobs, and, depressed, american, wages, sanders, said, that, america, needs, to, rebuild, its, manufacturing, base, using, american, factories, for, well, paying, jobs, for, american, labor, rather, than, outsourcing, to, china, and, elsewhere, shortly, after, his, election, u, s, president, donald, trump, said, he, would, begin, renegotiating, the, terms, of, nafta, to, resolve, trade, issues, he, had, campaigned, on, the, leaders, of, canada, and, mexico, had, indicated, their, willingness, to, work, with, the, trump, administration, although, vague, on, the, exact, terms, he, sought, in, a, renegotiated, nafta, trump, threatened, to, withdraw, from, it, if, negotiations, failed, in, july, 2017, the, trump, administration, provided, a, detailed, list, of, changes, that, it, would, like, to, see, to, nafta, the, top, priority, was, a, reduction, in, the, united, states, trade, deficit, the, administration, also, called, for, the, elimination, of, provisions, that, allowed, canada, and, mexico, to, appeal, duties, imposed, by, the, united, states, and, limited, the, ability, of, the, united, states, to, impose, import, restrictions, on, canada, and, mexico, being, consistent, with, the, president, s, stance, on, liking, trade, barriers, liking, protectionism, chad, bown, of, the, peterson, institute, for, international, economics, suggested, that, the, proposed, changes, would, make, nafta, in, many, respects, less, of, a, free, trade, agreement, additional, concerns, expressed, by, the, us, trade, representative, over, subsidized, state, owned, enterprises, and, currency, manipulation, were, not, thought, to, apply, to, canada, and, mexico, but, were, intended, rather, to, send, a, message, to, countries, beyond, north, america, john, murphy, vice, president, of, the, u, s, chamber, of, commerce, declared, that, a, number, of, the, proposals, tabled, by, the, united, states, had, little, or, no, support, from, the, u, s, business, and, agriculture, community, pat, roberts, the, senior, u, s, senator, from, kansas, said, it, was, not, clear, who, they, re, intended, to, benefit, and, called, for, push, back, against, the, anti, nafta, moves, as, the, issues, affect, real, jobs, real, lives, and, real, people, kansas, is, a, major, agricultural, exporter, and, farm, groups, warned, that, just, threatening, to, leave, nafta, might, cause, buyers, to, minimize, uncertainty, by, seeking, out, non, us, sources, a, fourth, round, of, talks, included, a, u, s, demand, for, a, sunset, clause, that, would, end, the, agreement, in, five, years, unless, the, three, countries, agreed, to, keep, it, in, place, a, provision, u, s, commerce, secretary, wilbur, ross, has, said, would, allow, the, countries, to, kill, the, deal, if, it, was, not, working, canadian, prime, minister, justin, trudeau, met, with, the, house, ways, and, means, committee, since, congress, would, have, to, pass, legislation, rolling, back, the, treaty, s, provisions, if, trump, tries, to, withdraw, from, the, pact, from, june, to, late, august, 2018, canada, was, sidelined, as, the, united, states, and, mexico, held, bilateral, talks, on, 27, august, 2018, mexico, and, the, united, states, announced, they, had, reached, a, bilateral, understanding, on, a, revamped, nafta, trade, deal, that, included, provisions, that, would, boost, automobile, production, in, the, u, s, a, 10, year, data, protection, period, against, generic, drug, production, on, an, expanded, list, of, products, that, benefits, pharmaceutical, companies, particularly, us, makers, producers, of, high, cost, biologic, drugs, a, sunset, clause, a, 16, year, expiration, date, with, regular, 6, year, reviews, to, possibly, renew, the, agreement, for, additional, 16, year, terms, and, an, increased, de, minimis, threshold, in, which, mexico, raised, the, de, minimis, value, to, 100, from, 50, regarding, online, duty, and, tax, free, purchases, according, to, an, august, 30, article, in, the, economist, mexico, agreed, to, increase, the, rules, of, origin, threshold, which, would, mean, that, 75, as, opposed, to, the, previous, 62, 5, of, a, vehicle, s, components, must, be, made, in, north, america, to, avoid, tariffs, since, car, makers, currently, import, less, expensive, components, from, asia, under, the, revised, agreement, consumers, would, pay, more, for, vehicles, as, well, approximately, 40, to, 45, per, cent, of, vehicle, components, must, be, made, by, workers, earning, a, minimum, of, us, 16, per, hour, in, contrast, to, the, current, us, 2, 30, an, hour, that, a, worker, earns, on, average, in, a, mexican, car, manufacturing, plant, the, economist, described, this, as, placing, mexican, carmaking, into, a, straitjacket, trudeau, and, canadian, foreign, minister, chrystia, freeland, announced, that, they, were, willing, to, join, the, agreement, if, it, was, in, canada, s, interests, freeland, returned, from, her, european, diplomatic, tour, early, cancelling, a, planned, visit, to, ukraine, to, participate, in, nafta, negotiations, in, washington, d, c, in, late, august, according, to, an, august, 31, canadian, press, published, in, the, ottawa, citizen, key, issues, under, debate, included, supply, management, chapter, 19, pharmaceuticals, cultural, exemption, the, sunset, clause, and, de, minimis, thresholds, although, president, donald, trump, warned, canada, on, september, 1, that, he, would, exclude, them, from, a, new, trade, agreement, unless, canada, submitted, to, his, demands, it, is, not, clear, that, the, trump, administration, had, the, authority, to, do, so, without, the, approval, of, congress, 34, 6, on, september, 30, 2018, the, day, of, the, deadline, for, the, canada, u, s, negotiations, a, preliminary, deal, between, the, two, countries, was, reached, thus, preserving, the, trilateral, pact, when, the, trump, administration, submits, the, agreement, before, congress, the, new, name, for, the, agreement, was, the, united, states, mexico, canada, agreement, usmca, and, came, into, effect, on, july, 1, 2020, following, donald, trump, s, election, to, the, presidency, a, range, of, trade, experts, said, that, pulling, out, of, nafta, as, trump, proposed, would, have, a, range, of, unintended, consequences, for, the, u, s, including, reduced, access, to, the, u, s, s, biggest, export, markets, a, reduction, in, economic, growth, and, increased, prices, for, gasoline, cars, fruits, and, vegetables, the, worst, affected, sectors, would, be, textiles, agriculture, and, automobiles, according, to, tufts, university, political, scientist, daniel, w, drezner, the, trump, administration, s, desire, to, return, relations, with, mexico, to, the, pre, nafta, era, are, misguided, drezner, argued, that, nafta, made, it, easier, for, mexico, to, transform, to, a, real, democracy, and, become, a, country, that, views, itself, as, north, american, if, trump, acts, on, many, of, the, threats, that, he, has, made, against, mexico, it, is, not, inconceivable, that, mexicans, would, turn, to, left, wing, populist, strongmen, as, several, south, american, countries, have, at, the, very, least, us, mexico, relations, would, worsen, with, adverse, implications, for, cooperation, on, border, security, counterterrorism, drug, war, operations, deportations, and, managing, central, american, migration, according, to, chad, p, bown, senior, fellow, at, the, peterson, institute, for, international, economics, a, renegotiated, nafta, that, would, reestablish, trade, barriers, is, unlikely, to, help, workers, who, lost, their, jobs, regardless, of, the, cause, take, advantage, of, new, employment, opportunities, according, to, harvard, economist, marc, melitz, recent, research, estimates, that, the, repeal, of, nafta, would, not, increase, car, production, in, the, united, states, melitz, noted, that, this, would, cost, manufacturing, jobs, if, the, original, trans, pacific, partnership, tpp, had, come, into, effect, existing, agreements, such, as, nafta, would, be, reduced, to, those, provisions, that, do, not, conflict, with, the, tpp, or, that, require, greater, trade, liberalization, than, the, tpp, however, only, canada, and, mexico, would, have, the, prospect, of, becoming, members, of, the, tpp, after, u, s, president, donald, trump, withdrew, the, united, states, from, the, agreement, in, january, 2017, in, may, 2017, the, 11, remaining, members, of, the, tpp, including, canada, and, mexico, agreed, to, proceed, with, a, revised, version, of, the, trade, deal, without, u, s, participation, the, american, public, was, largely, divided, on, its, view, of, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, nafta, with, a, wide, partisan, gap, in, beliefs, in, a, february, 2018, gallup, poll, 48, of, americans, said, nafta, was, good, for, the, u, s, while, 46, said, it, was, bad, according, to, a, journal, from, the, law, and, business, review, of, the, americas, lbra, u, s, public, opinion, of, nafta, centers, around, three, issues, nafta, s, impact, on, the, creation, or, destruction, of, american, jobs, nafta, s, impact, on, the, environment, and, nafta, s, impact, on, immigrants, entering, the, u, s, after, president, trump, s, election, in, 2016, support, for, nafta, became, very, polarized, between, republicans, and, democrats, donald, trump, expressed, negative, views, of, nafta, calling, it, the, single, worst, trade, deal, ever, approved, in, this, country, republican, support, for, nafta, decreased, from, 43, support, in, 2008, to, 34, in, 2017, meanwhile, democratic, support, for, nafta, increased, from, 41, support, in, 2008, to, 71, in, 2017, the, political, gap, was, especially, large, in, concern, to, views, on, free, trade, with, mexico, as, opposed, to, a, favorable, view, of, free, trade, with, canada, whom, 79, of, american, described, as, a, fair, trade, partner, only, 47, of, americans, believed, mexico, practices, fair, trade, the, gap, widened, between, democrats, and, republicans, 60, of, democrats, believed, mexico, is, practicing, fair, trade, while, only, 28, of, republicans, did, this, was, the, highest, level, from, democrats, and, the, lowest, level, from, republicans, ever, recorded, by, the, chicago, council, survey, republicans, had, more, negative, views, of, canada, as, a, fair, trade, partner, than, democrats, as, well, nafta, had, strong, support, from, young, americans, in, a,
