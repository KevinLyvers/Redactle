use, of, money, as, an, early, form, of, trade, money, was, invented, before, written, history, began, consequently, any, story, of, how, money, first, developed, is, mostly, based, on, conjecture, and, logical, inference, letters, of, credit, paper, money, and, non, physical, money, have, greatly, simplified, and, promoted, trade, as, buying, can, be, separated, from, selling, or, earning,

specialization, and, the, division, of, labor, a, predominant, form, of, economic, activity, in, which, individuals, and, groups, concentrate, on, a, small, aspect, of, production, but, use, their, output, in, trade, for, other, products, and, needs, trade, exists, between, regions, because, different, regions, may, have, a, comparative, advantage, perceived, or, real, in, the, production, of, some, trade, able, goods, including, the, production, of, scarce, or, limited, natural, resources, elsewhere, for, example, different, regions, sizes, may, encourage, mass, production, in, such, circumstances, trading, at, market, price, between, locations, can, benefit, both, locations, different, types, of, traders, may, specialize, in, trading, different, kinds, of, goods, for, example,

1914, trade, openness, increased, again, during, the, 1920s, but, collapsed, in, particular, in, europe, and, north, america, during, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, trade, openness, increased, substantially, again, from, the, 1950s, onward, albeit, with, a, slowdown, during, the, oil, crisis, of, the, 1970s, economists, and, economic, historians, contend, that, current, levels,

states, free, trade, between, states, was, stifled, by, the, need, for, strict, internal, controls, via, taxation, to, maintain, security, within, the, treasury, of, the, sovereign, which, nevertheless, enabled, the, maintenance, of, a, modicum, of, civility, within, the, structures, of, functional, community, life, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, and, the, succeeding, dark, ages, brought, instability, to, western, europe, and, a, near, collapse, of, the, trade, network, in, the, western, world, trade, however, continued, to, flourish, among, the, kingdoms, of, africa, the,

outrigger, boats, and, sailing, with, the, help, of, the, westerlies, in, the, indian, ocean, this, trade, network, expanded, to, reach, as, far, as, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, resulting, in, the, austronesian, colonization, of, madagascar, by, the, first, half, of, the, first, millennium, ad, it, continued, up, to, historic, times, later, becoming, the, maritime, silk, road, the,

southern, tip, of, the, african, continent, prior, to, this, the, flow, of, spice, into, europe, from, india, was, controlled, by, islamic, powers, especially, egypt, the, spice, trade, was, of, major, economic, importance, and, helped, spur, the, age, of, discovery, in, europe, spices, brought, to, europe, from, the, eastern, world, were, some, of, the, most, valuable, commodities, for, their, weight, sometimes, rivaling, gold, from, 1070, onward, kingdoms, in, west, africa, became, significant, members, of, global, trade, this, came, initially, through, the, movement, of, gold, and, other, resources, sent, out, by, muslim, traders, on, the, trans, saharan, trading, network, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, european, merchants, would, purchase, gold, spices, cloth, timber, and,

centuries, the, portuguese, gained, an, economic, advantage, in, the, kingdom, of, kongo, due, to, different, philosophies, of, trade, whereas, portuguese, traders, concentrated, on, the, accumulation, of, capital, in, kongo, spiritual, meaning, was, attached, to, many, objects, of, trade, according, to, economic, historian, toby, green, in, kongo, giving, more, than, receiving, was, a, symbol, of, spiritual, and, political, power, and, privilege, in, the, 16th, century, the, seventeen, provinces, were, the, center, of, free, trade, imposing, no, exchange, controls, and,

the, 18th, century, the, spanish, empire, developed, regular, trade, links, across, both, the, atlantic, and, the, pacific, oceans, in, 1776, adam, smith, published, the, paper, an, inquiry, into, the, nature, and, causes, of, the, wealth, of, nations, it, criticized, mercantilism, and, argued, that, economic, specialization, could, benefit, nations, just, as, much, as, firms, since, the, division, of, labour, was, restricted, by, the, size, of, the, market, he, said, that, countries, having, access, to, larger, markets, would, be, able, to, divide, labour, more, efficiently, and, thereby, become, more, productive, smith, said, that, he, considered, all, rationalizations, of, import, and, export, controls, dupery, which, hurt, the, trading, nation, as, a, whole, for, the, benefit, of, specific, industries, in, 1799, the, dutch, east, india, company, formerly, the, world, s, largest, company, became, bankrupt, partly, due, to, the, rise, of, competitive, free, trade, in, 1817, david, ricardo, james, mill, and, robert, torrens, showed, that, free, trade, would, benefit, the, industrially, weak, as, well, as, the, strong, in, the, famous, theory, of, comparative, advantage, in, principles, of, political, economy, and, taxation, ricardo, advanced, the, doctrine, still, considered, the, most, counterintuitive, in, economics, the, ascendancy, of, free, trade, was, primarily, based, on, national, advantage, in, the, mid, 19th, century, that, is, the, calculation, made, was, whether, it, was, in, any, particular, country, s, self, interest, to, open, its, borders, to, imports, john, stuart, mill, proved, that, a, country, with, monopoly, pricing, power, on, the, international, market, could, manipulate, the, terms, of, trade, through, maintaining, tariffs, and, that, the, response, to, this, might, be, reciprocity, in, trade, policy, ricardo, and, others, had, suggested, this, earlier, this, was, taken, as, evidence, against, the, universal, doctrine, of, free, trade, as, it, was, believed, that, more, of, the, economic, surplus, of, trade, would, accrue, to, a, country, following, reciprocal, rather, than, completely, free, trade, policies, this, was, followed, within, a, few, years, by, the, infant, industry, scenario, developed, by, mill, promoting, the, theory, that, the, government, had, the, duty, to, protect, young, industries, although, only, for, a, time, necessary, for, them, to, develop, full, capacity, this, became, the, policy, in, many, countries, attempting, to, industrialize, and, out, compete, english, exporters, milton, friedman, later, continued, this, vein, of, thought, showing, that, in, a, few, circumstances, tariffs, might, be, beneficial, to, the, host, country, but, never, for, the, world, at, large, the, great, depression, was, a, major, economic, recession, that, ran, from, 1929, to, the, late, 1930s, during, this, period, there, was, a, great, drop, in, trade, and, other, economic, indicators, the, lack, of, free, trade, was, considered, by, many, as, a, principal, cause, of, the, depression, causing, stagnation, and, inflation, only, during, world, war, ii, did, the, recession, end, in, the, united, states, also, during, the, war, in, 1944, 44, countries, signed, the, bretton, woods, agreement, intended, to, prevent, national, trade, barriers, to, avoid, depressions, it, set, up, rules, and, institutions, to, regulate, the, international, political, economy, the, international, monetary, fund, and, the, international, bank, for, reconstruction, and, development, later, divided, into, the, world, bank, bank, for, international, settlements, these, organizations, became, operational, in, 1946, after, enough, countries, ratified, the, agreement, in, 1947, 23,

services, the, biggest, export, market, for, around, 80, countries, today, trade, is, merely, a, subset, within, a, complex, system, of, companies, which, try, to, maximize, their, profits, by, offering, products, and, services, to, the, market, which, consists, both, of, individuals, and, other, companies, at, the, lowest, production, cost, a, system, of, international, trade, has, helped, to, develop, the, world, economy, but, in, combination, with, bilateral, or, multilateral, agreements, to, lower, tariffs, or, to, achieve, free, trade, has, sometimes, harmed, third, world, markets, for, local, products, free, trade, is, a, policy, by, which, a, government, does, not, discriminate, against, imports, or, exports, by, applying, tariffs, or, subsidies, this, policy, is, also, known, as, laissez, faire, policy, this, kind, of, policy, does, not, necessarily, imply, because, a, country, will, then, abandon, all, control, and, taxation, of, imports, and, exports, free, trade, advanced, further, in, the, late, 20th, century, and, early, 2000s, protectionism, is, the, policy, of, restraining, and, discouraging, trade, between, states, and, contrasts, with, the, policy, of, free, trade, this, policy, often, takes, the, form, of, tariffs, and, restrictive, quotas, protectionist, policies, were, particularly, prevalent, in, the, 1930s, between, the, great, depression, and, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, islamic, teachings, encourage, trading, and, condemn, usury, or, interest, judeao, christian, teachings, do, not, prohibit, trade, they, do, prohibit, fraud, and,
