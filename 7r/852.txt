members, of, another, group, discriminatory, traditions, policies, ideas, practices, and, laws, exist, in, many, countries, and, institutions, in, all, parts, of, the, world, including, some, where, such, discrimination, is, generally, decried, in, some, places, countervailing, measures, such, as, quotas, have, been, used, to, redress, the, balance, in, favor, of, those, who, are, believed, to, be, current, or, past, victims, of, discrimination, these, attempts, have, often, been, met, with, controversy, and, sometimes, been, called, reverse, discrimination, the, term, discriminate, appeared, in, the, early, 17th, century, in, the, english, language, it, is, from, the, latin, discriminat, distinguished, between, from, the, verb, discriminare, from, discrimen, distinction, from, the, verb, discernere, corresponding, to, to, discern, since, the, american, civil, war, the, term, discrimination, generally, evolved, in, american, english, usage, as, an, understanding, of,

need, not, be, actually, harmed, in, order, to, be, discriminated, against, he, or, she, just, needs, to, be, treated, worse, than, others, for, some, arbitrary, reason, if, someone, decides, to, donate, to, help, orphan, children, but, decides, to, donate, less, say, to, children, of, a, particular, race, out, of, a, racist, attitude, he, or, she, will, be, acting, in, a, discriminatory, way, even, if, he, or, she, actually, benefits, the, people, he, discriminates, against, by, donating, some, money, to, them, discrimination, also, develops, into, a, source, of, oppression, the, action, of, recognizing, someone, as, different, so, much, that, they, are, treated, inhumanly, and, degraded, this, moralized, definition, of, discrimination, is, distinct, from, a, non, moralized, definition, in, the, former, discrimination, is, wrong, by, definition, whereas, in, the, latter, this, is, not, the, case, the, united, nations, stance, on, discrimination, includes, the, statement,

living, results, in, public, and, private, places, and, services, educational, settings, and, social, services, that, are, built, to, serve, standard, people, thereby, excluding, those, with, various, disabilities, studies, have, shown, that, disabled, people, not, only, need, employment, in, order, to, be, provided, with, the, opportunity, to, earn, a, living, but, they, also, need, employment, in, order, to, sustain, their, mental, health, and, well, being, work, fulfils, a, number, of, basic, needs, for, an, individual, such, as, collective, purpose, social, contact, status, and, activity,

speech, including, their, first, language, their, accent, the, perceived, size, of, their, vocabulary, whether, or, not, the, speaker, uses, complex, and, varied, words, their, modality, and, their, syntax, for, example, an, occitan, speaker, in, france, will, probably, be, treated, differently, from, a, french, speaker, based, on, a, difference, in, use, of, language, a, person, may, automatically, form, judgments, about, another, person, s, wealth, education, social, status, character, or, other, traits, which, may, lead, to, discrimination, linguistic, discrimination, was, at, first, considered, an, act, of, racism, in, the, mid, 1980s, linguist, tove, skutnabb, kangas, captured, the, idea, of, language, based, discrimination, as, linguicism, which, was, defined, as, ideologies, and, structures, which, are, used, to, legitimize, effectuate, and, reproduce, unequal, divisions, of, power, and, resources, both, material, and, non, material, between, groups, which, are, defined, on, the, basis, of, language, although, different, names, have, been, given, to, this, form, of, discrimination, they, all, hold, the, same, definition, linguistic, discrimination, is, culturally, and, socially, determined, due, to, preference, for, one, use, of, language, over, others, discrimination, based, on, a, person, s, name, may, also, occur, with, researchers, suggesting, that, this, form, of, discrimination, is, present, based, on, a, name, s, meaning, its, pronunciation, its, uniqueness, its, gender, affiliation, and, its, racial, affiliation, research, has, further, shown, that, real, world, recruiters, spend, an, average, of, just, six, seconds, reviewing, each, r, sum, before, making, their, initial, fit, no, fit, screen, out, decision, and, that, a, person, s, name, is, one, of, the, six, things, they, focus, on, most, france, has, made, it, illegal, to, view, a, person, s, name, on, a, r, sum, when, screening, for, the, initial, list, of, most, qualified, candidates, great, britain, germany, sweden, and, the, netherlands, have, also, experimented, with, name, blind, summary, processes, some, apparent, discrimination, may, be, explained, by, other, factors, such, as, name, frequency, the, effects, of, name, discrimination, based, on, a, name, s, fluency, is, subtle, small, and, subject, to, significantly, changing, norms, the, anti, discrimination, laws, of, most, countries, allow, and, make, exceptions, for, discrimination, based, on, nationality, and, immigration, status, the, international, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, racial, discrimination, cerd, does, not, prohibit, discrimination, by, nationality, citizenship, or, naturalization, but, forbids, discrimination, against, any, particular, nationality, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, nationality, is, usually, included, in, employment, laws, see, above, section, for, employment, discrimination, specifically, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, bound, together, with, racial, discrimination, although, it, can, be, separate, it, may, vary, from, laws, that, stop, refusals, of, hiring, based, on, nationality, asking, questions, regarding, origin, to, prohibitions, of, firing, forced, retirement, compensation, and, pay, etc, based, on, nationality, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, nationality, may, show, as, a, level, of, acceptance, in, a, sport, or, work, team, regarding, new, team, members, and, employees, who, differ, from, the, nationality, of, the, majority, of, team, members, in, the, gcc, states, in,

available, for, citizens, only, westerners, might, also, get, paid, more, than, other, expatriates, racial, and, ethnic, discrimination, differentiates, individuals, on, the, basis, of, real, and, perceived, racial, and, ethnic, differences, and, leads, to, various, forms, of, the, ethnic, penalty, it, can, also, refer, to, the, belief, that, groups, of, humans, possess, different, behavioral, traits, corresponding, to, physical, appearance, and, can, be, divided, based, on, the, superiority, of, one, race, over, another, it, may, also, mean, prejudice, discrimination, or, antagonism, directed, against, other, people, because, they, are, of, a, different, race, or, ethnicity, modern, variants, of, racism, are, often, based, in, social, perceptions, of, biological, differences, between, peoples, these, views, can, take, the, form, of, social, actions, practices, or, beliefs, or, political, systems, in, which, different, races, are, ranked, as, inherently, superior, or, inferior, to, each, other, based, on, presumed, shared, inheritable, traits, abilities, or, qualities, it, has, been, official, government, policy, in, several, countries, such, as, south, africa, during, the, apartheid, era, discriminatory, policies, towards, ethnic, minorities, include, the, race, based, discrimination, against, ethnic, indians, and, chinese, in, malaysia, after, the,

that, is, based, on, the, region, in, which, a, person, lives, or, the, region, in, which, a, person, was, born, it, differs, from, national, discrimination, because, it, may, not, be, based, on, national, borders, or, the, country, in, which, the, victim, lives, instead, it, is, based, on, prejudices, against, a, specific, region, of, one, or, more, countries, examples, include, discrimination, against, chinese, people, who, were, born, in, regions, of, the, countryside, that, are, far, away, from, cities, that, are, located, within, china, and, discrimination, against, americans, who, are, from, the, southern, or, northern, regions, of, the, united, states, it, is, often, accompanied, by, discrimination, that, is, based, on, accent, dialect, or, cultural, differences, religious, discrimination, is, valuing, or, treating, people, or, groups, differently, because, of, what, they, do, or, do, not, believe, in, or, because, of, their, feelings, towards, a, given, religion, for, instance, the, jewish, population, of, germany, and, indeed, a, large, portion, of, europe, was, subjected, to, discrimination, under, adolf, hitler, and, his, nazi, party, between, 1933, and, 1945, they, were, forced, to, live, in, ghettos, wear, an, identifying, star, of, david, on, their, clothes, and, sent, to, concentration, and, death, camps, in, rural, germany, and, poland, where, they, were, to, be, tortured, and, killed, all, because, of, their, jewish, religion, many, laws, most, prominently, the, nuremberg, laws, of, 1935, separated, those, of, jewish, faith, as, supposedly, inferior, to, the, christian, population, restrictions, on, the, types, of, occupations, that, jewish, people, could, hold, were, imposed, by, christian, authorities, local, rulers, and, church, officials, closed, many, professions, to, religious, jews, pushing, them, into, marginal, roles, that, were, considered, socially, inferior, such, as, tax, and, rent, collecting,

intersex, to, legislation, as, part, of, the, attribute, of, sex, australia, was, the, first, country, to, add, an, independent, attribute, of, intersex, status, malta, was, the, first, to, adopt, a, broader, framework, of, sex, characteristics, through, legislation, that, also, ended, modifications, to, the, sex, characteristics, of, minors, undertaken, for, social, and, cultural, reasons, global, efforts, such, as, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 5, is, also, aimed, at, ending, all, forms, of, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, gender, and, sex, one, s, sexual,

engagement, in, a, rainbow, organisation, or, by, mentioning, one, s, partner, name, lowers, employment, opportunities, in, cyprus, and, greece, but, overall, it, has, no, negative, effect, in, sweden, and, belgium, in, the, latter, country, even, a, positive, effect, of, revealing, a, lesbian, sexual, orientation, is, found, for, women, at, their, fertile, ages, besides, these, academic, studies, in, 2009, ilga, published, a, report, based, on, research, carried, out, by, daniel, ottosson, at, s, dert, rn, university, college, in, stockholm, sweden, this, research, found, that, of, the, 80, countries, around, the, world, that, continue, to, consider, homosexuality, illegal, five, carry, the, death, penalty, for, homosexual, activity, and, two, do, in, some, regions, of, the,

blocking, of, men, s, anuses, with, glue, and, then, giving, the, men, laxatives, although, gay, marriage, has, been, legal, in, south, africa, since, 2006, same, sex, unions, are, often, condemned, as, un, african, research, conducted, in, 2009, shows, 86, of, black, lesbians, from, the, western, cape, live, in, fear, of, sexual, assault, a, number, of, countries, especially, those, in, the, western, world, have, passed, measures, to, alleviate, discrimination, against, sexual, minorities, including, laws, against, anti, gay, hate, crimes, and, workplace, discrimination, some, have, also, legalized, same, sex, marriage, or, civil, unions, in, order, to, grant, same, sex, couples, the, same, protections, and, benefits, as, opposite, sex, couples, in, 2011, the, united, nations, passed, its, first, resolution, recognizing, lgbt, rights, reverse, discrimination, is, discrimination, against, members, of, a, dominant, or, majority, group, in, favor, of, members, of, a, minority, or, historically, disadvantaged, group, groups, may, be, defined, in, terms, of, disability, ethnicity, family, status, gender, identity, nationality, race, religion, sex, and, sexual, orientation, or, other, factors, this, discrimination, may, seek, to, redress, social, inequalities, under, which, minority, groups, have, had, less, access, to, privileges, enjoyed, by, the, majority, group, in, such, cases, it, is, intended, to, remove, discrimination, that, minority, groups, may, already, face, reverse, discrimination, can, be, defined, as, the, unequal, treatment, of, members, of, the, majority, groups, resulting, from, preferential, policies, as, in, college, admissions, or, employment, intended, to, remedy, earlier, discrimination, against, minorities, conceptualizing, affirmative, action, as, reverse, discrimination, became, popular, in, the, early, to, mid, 1970s, a, time, period, that, focused, on, under, representation, and, action, policies, intended, to, remedy, the, effects, of, past, discrimination, in, both, government, and, the, business, world, article, 15, of, the, constitution, of, india, prohibits, discrimination, against, any, citizen, on, grounds, of, caste, religion, sex, race, or, place, of, birth, etc, similarly, the, constitution, of, india, guarantees, several, rights, to, all, citizens, irrespective, of, gender, such, as, right, to, equality, under, article, 14, right, to, life, and, personal, liberty, under, article, 21, indian, penal, code, 1860, section, 153, a, criminalises, the, use, of, language, that, promotes, discrimination, or, violence, against, people, on, the, basis, of, race, caste, sex, place, of, birth, religion, gender, identity, sexual, orientation, or, any, other, category, important, un, documents, addressing, discrimination, include, social, theories, such, as, egalitarianism, assert, that, social, equality, should, prevail, in, some, societies, including, most, developed, countries, each, individual, s, civil, rights, include, the, right, to, be, free, from, government, sponsored, social, discrimination, due, to, a, belief, in, the, capacity, to, perceive, pain, or, suffering, shared, by, all, animals, abolitionist, or, vegan, egalitarianism, maintains, that, the, interests, of, every, individual, regardless, of, their, species, warrant, equal, consideration, with, the, interests, of, humans, and, that, not, doing, so, is, speciesist, philosophers, have, debated, as, to, how, inclusive, the, definition, of, discrimination, should, be, some, philosophers, have, argued, that, discrimination, should, only, refer, to, wrongful, or, disadvantageous, treatment, in, the, context, of, a, socially, salient, group, such, as, race, gender, sexuality, etc, within, a, given, context, under, this, view, failure, to, limit, the, concept, of, discrimination, would, lead, to, it, being, overinclusive, for, example, since, most, murders, occur, because, of, some, perceived, difference, between, the, perpetrator, and, the, victim, many, murders, would, constitute, discrimination, if, the, social, salience, requirement, is, not, included, thus, this, view, argues, that, making, the, definition, of, discrimination, overinclusive, renders, it, meaningless, conversely, other, philosophers, argue, that, discrimination, should, simply, refer, to, wrongful, disadvantageous, treatment, regardless, of, the, social, salience, of, the, group, arguing, that, limiting, the, concept, only, to, socially, salient, groups, is, arbitrary, as, well, as, raising, issues, of, determining, which, groups, would, count, as, socially, salient, the, issue, of, which, groups, should, count, has, caused, many, political, and, social, debates, based, on, realistic, conflict, theory, and, social, identity, theory, rubin, and, hewstone, have, highlighted, a, distinction, among, three, types, of, discrimination, discrimination, in, labeling, theory, takes, form, as, mental, categorization, of, minorities, and, the, use, of, stereotype, this, theory, describes, difference, as, deviance, from, the, norm, which, results, in, internal, devaluation, and, social, stigma, that, may, be, seen, as, discrimination, it, is, started, by, describing, a, natural, social, order, it, is, distinguished, between, the, fundamental, principle, of, fascism, and, social, democracy, the, nazis, in, 1930s, era, germany, and, the, pre, 1990, apartheid, government, of, south, africa, used, racially, discriminatory, agendas, for, their, political, ends, this, practice, continues, with, some, present, day, governments, economist, yanis, varoufakis, 2013, argues, that, discrimination, based, on, utterly, arbitrary, characteristics, evolves, quickly, and, systematically, in, the, experimental, laboratory, and, that, neither, classical, game, theory, nor, neoclassical, economics, can, explain, this, in, 2002, varoufakis, and, shaun, hargreaves, heap, ran, an, experiment, where, volunteers, played, a, computer, mediated, multiround, hawk, dove, game, at, the, start, of, each, session, each, participant, was, assigned, a, color, at, random, either, red, or, blue, at, each, round, each, player, learned, the, color, assigned, to, his, or, her, opponent, but, nothing, else, about, the, opponent, hargreaves, heap, and, varoufakis, found, that, the, players, behavior, within, a, session, frequently, developed, a, discriminatory, convention, giving, a, nash, equilibrium, where, players, of, one, color, the, advantaged, color, consistently, played, the, aggressive, hawk, strategy, against, players, of, the, other, disadvantaged, color, who, played, the, acquiescent, dove, strategy, against, the, advantaged, color, players, of, both, colors, used, a, mixed, strategy, when, playing, against, players, assigned, the, same, color, as, their, own, the, experimenters, then, added, a, cooperation, option, to, the, game, and, found, that, disadvantaged, players, usually, cooperated, with, each, other, while, advantaged, players, usually, did, not, they, state, that, while, the, equilibria, reached, in, the, original, hawk, dove, game, are, predicted, by, evolutionary, game, theory, game, theory, does, not, explain, the, emergence, of, cooperation, in, the, disadvantaged, group, citing, earlier, psychological, work, of, matthew, rabin, they, hypothesize, that, a, norm, of, differing, entitlements, emerges, across, the, two, groups, and, that, this, norm, could, define, a, fairness, equilibrium, within, the, disadvantaged, group
