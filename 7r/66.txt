the, fishing, industry, includes, any, industry, or, activity, that, takes, cultures, processes, preserves, stores, transports, markets, or, sells, fish, or, fish, products, it, is, defined, by, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, as, including, recreational, subsistence, and, commercial, fishing, as, well, as, the, related, harvesting, processing, and, marketing, sectors, the, commercial, activity, is, aimed, at, the, delivery, of, fish, and, other, seafood, products, for, human, consumption, or, as, input, factors, in, other, industrial, processes, the, livelihood, of, over, 500, million, people, in, developing, countries, depends, directly, or, indirectly, on, fisheries, and, aquaculture, the, fishing, industry, is, struggling, with, environmental, and, welfare, issues, including, overfishing, and, occupational, safety, additionally, the, combined, pressures, of, climate, change, biodiversity, loss, and, overfishing, endanger, the, livelihoods, and, food, security, of, a, substantial, portion, of, the, global, population, tuna, billfish, shark, herring, sardine, anchovy, menhaden, cod, flatfish, freshwater, carp, salmon, tilapia, the, industry, has, three, principal, sectors, that, include, recreational, subsistence, and, commercial, fishing, other, slightly, different, definitions, exist, for, example, the, australian, government, uses, artisanal, fishing, or, traditional, subsistence, fishing, consists, of, various, small, scale, low, technology, low, capital, fishing, practices, undertaken, by, individual, fisherman, as, opposed, to, commercial, fishing, many, of, these, households, are, of, coastal, or, island, ethnic, groups, these, households, make, short, rarely, overnight, fishing, trips, close, to, the, shore, their, produce, is, usually, not, processed, and, is, mainly, for, local, consumption, artisan, fishing, uses, traditional, fishing, techniques, such, as, rod, and, tackle, fishing, arrows, and, harpoons, cast, nets, and, small, if, any, traditional, fishing, boats, for, that, reason, socio, economic, status, of, artisanal, fishing, community, has, become, an, interest, of, the, authorities, in, recent, years, commercial, fishing, is, the, activity, of, catching, fish, and, other, seafood, for, commercial, profit, mostly, from, wild, fisheries, it, provides, a, large, quantity, of, food, to, many, countries, around, the, world, but, those, who, practice, it, as, an, industry, must, often, pursue, fish, far, into, the, ocean, under, adverse, conditions, large, scale, commercial, fishing, is, called, industrial, fishing, the, major, fishing, industries, are, not, only, owned, by, major, corporations, but, by, small, families, as, well, in, order, to, adapt, to, declining, fish, populations, and, increased, demand, many, commercial, fishing, operations, have, reduced, the, sustainability, of, their, harvest, by, fishing, further, down, the, food, chain, this, raises, concern, for, fishery, managers, and, researchers, who, highlight, how, further, they, say, that, for, those, reasons, the, sustainability, of, the, marine, ecosystems, could, be, in, danger, of, collapsing, commercial, fishermen, harvest, a, wide, variety, of, animals, however, a, very, small, number, of, species, support, the, majority, of, the, world, s, fisheries, these, include, herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster, and, scallops, all, except, these, last, four, provided, a, worldwide, catch, of, well, over, a, million, tonnes, in, 1999, with, herring, and, sardines, together, providing, a, catch, of, over, 22, million, metric, tons, in, 1999, many, other, species, are, fished, in, smaller, numbers, fish, are, harvested, by, commercial, fishing, and, aquaculture, the, world, harvest, increased, over, the, 20th, century, and, by, 1986, had, stabilized, around, 85, 95, million, metric, tons, 94, 10, 6, 105, 10, 6, short, tons, per, year, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, the, world, harvest, in, 2005, consisted, of, 93, 3, million, metric, tons, 102, 8, 10, 6, short, tons, captured, by, commercial, fishing, in, wild, fisheries, plus, 48, 1, million, metric, tons, 53, 0, 10, 6, short, tons, produced, by, fish, farms, in, addition, 1, 3, million, metric, tons, 1, 4, 10, 6, short, tons, of, aquatic, plants, seaweed, etc, were, captured, in, wild, fisheries, and, 14, 8, million, metric, tons, 16, 3, 10, 6, short, tons, were, produced, by, aquaculture, the, number, of, individual, fish, caught, in, the, wild, has, been, estimated, at, 0, 97, 2, 7, trillion, per, year, not, counting, fish, farms, or, marine, invertebrates, following, is, a, table, of, the, 2011, world, fishing, industry, harvest, in, tonnes, metric, tons, by, capture, and, by, aquaculture, once, fish, is, caught, especially, in, commercial, sectors, bringing, the, fish, to, consumers, require, a, complex, series, of, related, industries, fish, processing, is, the, processing, of, fish, delivered, by, commercial, fisheries, and, fish, farms, the, larger, fish, processing, companies, have, their, own, fishing, fleets, and, independent, fisheries, the, products, of, the, industry, are, usually, sold, wholesale, to, grocery, chains, or, to, intermediaries, fish, processing, can, be, subdivided, into, two, categories, fish, handling, the, initial, processing, of, raw, fish, and, fish, products, manufacturing, aspects, of, fish, processing, occur, on, fishing, vessels, fish, processing, vessels, and, at, fish, processing, plants, another, natural, subdivision, is, into, primary, processing, involved, in, the, filleting, and, freezing, of, fresh, fish, for, onward, distribution, to, fresh, fish, retail, and, catering, outlets, and, the, secondary, processing, that, produces, chilled, frozen, and, canned, products, for, the, retail, and, catering, trades, fisheries, are, estimated, to, currently, provide, 16, of, the, world, population, s, protein, the, flesh, of, many, fish, are, primarily, valued, as, a, source, of, food, there, are, many, edible, species, of, fish, other, marine, life, taken, as, food, includes, shellfish, crustaceans, sea, cucumber, jellyfish, and, roe, fish, and, other, marine, life, can, also, be, used, for, many, other, uses, pearls, and, mother, of, pearl, sharkskin, and, rayskin, sea, horses, star, fish, sea, urchins, and, sea, cucumber, are, used, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, tyrian, purple, is, a, pigment, made, from, marine, snails, and, sepia, is, a, pigment, made, from, the, inky, secretions, of, cuttlefish, fish, glue, has, long, been, valued, for, its, use, in, all, manner, of, products, isinglass, is, used, for, the, clarification, of, wine, and, beer, fish, emulsion, is, a, fertilizer, emulsion, that, is, produced, from, the, fluid, remains, of, fish, processed, for, fish, oil, and, fish, meal, fish, derived, protein, hydrolysates, have, been, identified, to, exhibit, a, wide, range, of, bioactivities, making, them, important, to, food, and, health, care, industries, hydrolysates, derived, from, fish, processing, by, products, like, swim, bladder, skin, scale, bones, and, fins, display, blood, pressure, regulatory, anti, inflammatory, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, and, anti, cancer, activity, fish, hydrolysates, are, also, on, the, rise, for, commercial, purposes, in, food, industries, due, to, their, lipid, peroxidation, inhibition, high, emulsification, activity, and, large, water, retention, capacity, making, them, effective, food, matrix, stabilization, and, shelf, life, enhancement, agents, in, the, industry, the, term, seafood, products, is, often, used, instead, of, fish, products, fish, markets, are, marketplace, used, for, the, trade, in, and, sale, of, fish, and, other, seafood, they, can, be, dedicated, to, wholesale, trade, between, fishermen, and, fish, merchants, or, to, the, sale, of, seafood, to, individual, consumers, or, to, both, retail, fish, markets, a, type, of, wet, market, often, sell, street, food, as, well, most, shrimp, are, sold, frozen, and, are, marketed, in, different, categories, the, live, food, fish, trade, is, a, global, system, that, links, fishing, communities, with, markets, the, environmental, impact, of, fishing, includes, issues, such, as, the, availability, of, fish, overfishing, fisheries, and, fisheries, management, as, well, as, the, impact, of, industrial, fishing, on, other, elements, of, the, environment, such, as, bycatch, these, issues, are, part, of, marine, conservation, and, are, addressed, in, fisheries, science, programs, according, to, a, 2019, fao, report, global, production, of, fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and, other, aquatic, animals, has, continued, to, grow, and, reached, 172, 6, million, tonnes, in, 2017, with, an, increase, of, 4, 1, percent, compared, with, 2016, there, is, a, growing, gap, between, the, supply, of, fish, and, demand, due, in, part, to, world, population, growth, fishing, and, pollution, from, fishing, are, the, largest, contributors, to, the, decline, in, ocean, health, and, water, quality, ghost, nets, or, nets, abandoned, in, the, ocean, are, made, of, plastic, and, nylon, and, do, not, decompose, wreaking, extreme, havoc, on, the, wildlife, and, ecosystems, they, interrupt, overfishing, and, destruction, of, marine, ecosystems, may, have, a, significant, impact, on, other, aspects, of, the, environment, such, as, seabird, populations, on, top, of, the, overfishing, there, is, a, seafood, shortage, resulting, from, the, mass, amounts, of, seafood, waste, as, well, as, the, microplastics, that, are, polluting, the, seafood, consumed, by, the, public, the, latter, is, largely, caused, by, plastic, made, fishing, gear, like, drift, nets, and, longlining, equipment, that, are, wearing, down, by, use, lost, or, thrown, away, the, journal, science, published, a, four, year, study, in, november, 2006, which, predicted, that, at, prevailing, trends, the, world, would, run, out, of, wild, caught, seafood, in, 2048, the, scientists, stated, that, the, decline, was, a, result, of, overfishing, pollution, and, other, environmental, factors, that, were, reducing, the, population, of, fisheries, at, the, same, time, as, their, ecosystems, were, being, annihilated, many, countries, such, as, tonga, the, united, states, australia, and, bahamas, and, international, management, bodies, have, taken, steps, to, appropriately, manage, marine, resources, a, conventional, idea, of, a, sustainable, fishery, is, that, it, is, one, that, is, harvested, at, a, sustainable, rate, where, the, fish, population, does, not, decline, over, time, because, of, fishing, practices, sustainability, in, fisheries, combines, theoretical, disciplines, such, as, the, population, dynamics, of, fisheries, with, practical, strategies, such, as, avoiding, overfishing, through, techniques, such, as, individual, fishing, quotas, curtailing, destructive, and, illegal, fishing, practices, by, lobbying, for, appropriate, law, and, policy, setting, up, protected, areas, restoring, collapsed, fisheries, incorporating, all, externalities, involved, in, harvesting, marine, ecosystems, into, fishery, economics, educating, stakeholders, and, the, wider, public, and, developing, independent, certification, programs, the, ocean, covers, 71, of, the, earth, s, surface, and, 80, of, the, value, of, exploited, marine, resources, are, attributed, to, the, fishing, industry, the, fishing, industry, has, provoked, various, international, disputes, as, wild, fish, capture, rose, to, a, peak, about, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, and, has, since, started, a, gradual, decline, iceland, japan, and, portugal, are, the, greatest, consumers, of, seafood, per, capita, in, the, world, chile, and, peru, are, countries, with, high, fish, consumption, and, therefore, had, troubles, regarding, their, fish, industries, in, 1947, chile, and, peru, first, adopted, the, 200, nautical, mile, standard, as, their, exclusive, economic, zone, eez, and, in, 1982, the, un, formally, adopted, this, term, in, the, 2000s, chile, and, peru, suffered, a, serious, fish, crisis, because, of, excessive, fishing, and, lack, of, proper, regulations, and, now, political, power, play, in, the, area, is, rekindled, from, the, late, 1950s, offshore, bottom, trawlers, began, exploiting, the, deeper, part, leading, to, a, large, catch, increase, and, a, strong, decline, in, the, underlying, biomass, the, stock, collapsed, to, extremely, low, levels, in, the, early, 1990s, and, this, is, a, well, known, example, of, non, excludable, non, rivalrous, public, good, in, economics, causing, free, rider, problems, following, the, collapse, of, the, atlantic, northwest, cod, fishery, in, 1992, a, dispute, arose, between, canada, and, the, european, union, over, the, right, to, fish, greenland, halibut, also, known, as, turbot, just, outside, of, canada, s, exclusive, economic, zone, in, the, grand, banks, of, newfoundland, the, dispute, became, known, as, the, turbot, war, on, 9, march, 1995, in, response, to, observations, of, foreign, vessels, fishing, illegally, in, canadian, waters, and, using, illegal, equipment, outside, of, canada, s, eez, canadian, officials, boarded, and, seized, the, spanish, trawler, estai, in, international, waters, on, the, grand, banks, throughout, march, the, spanish, navy, deployed, patrol, ships, to, protect, fishing, boats, in, the, area, and, canadian, forces, were, authorized, to, open, fire, on, any, spanish, vessel, showing, its, guns, canada, and, the, european, union, reached, a, settlement, on, 15, april, which, led, to, significant, reforms, in, international, fishing, agreements, iceland, is, one, of, the, largest, consumers, in, the, world, and, in, 1972, a, dispute, occurred, between, uk, and, iceland, because, of, iceland, s, announcement, of, an, exclusive, economic, zone, eez, to, reduce, overfishing, this, dispute, is, called, the, cod, wars, direct, confrontations, between, icelandic, patrol, vessels, and, british, warships, nowadays, in, europe, in, general, countries, are, searching, for, a, way, to, recover, their, fishing, industries, overfishing, of, eu, fisheries, is, costing, 3, 2, billion, euros, a, year, and, 100, 000, jobs, according, to, a, report, so, europe, is, constantly, looking, for, some, collective, actions, that, could, be, taken, to, prevent, overfishing, japan, china, and, korea, are, some, of, the, greatest, consumers, of, fish, and, have, some, disputes, over, exclusive, economic, zone, in, 2011, due, to, a, serious, earthquake, the, nuclear, power, facility, in, fukushima, was, damaged, a, huge, amount, of, contaminated, water, leaked, and, entered, the, ocean, tokyo, electric, power, company, tepco, admitted, that, around, 300, tonnes, of, highly, radioactive, water, had, leaked, from, a, storage, tank, on, the, site, in, the, kuroshio, current, the, sea, near, fukushima, about, 11, countries, catch, fish, not, only, the, surrounding, countries, such, as, japan, korea, and, china, but, also, the, countries, like, ukraine, spain, and, russia, have, boats, in, the, kuroshio, current, in, september, 2013, south, korea, banned, all, fish, imports, from, eight, japanese, prefectures, due, to, the, radioactive, water, leaks, from, the, fukushima, nuclear, plant, the, north, pacific, anadromous, fish, commission, npfc, was, established, in, 2015, to, manage, fish, stocks, against, increasing, demand, members, are, canada, japan, russia, the, united, states, and, south, korea, china, taiwan, and, vanuatu, also, participated, in, the, meeting, the, npfc, imposes, catch, limits, on, member, countries, and, countries, participating, in, the, conference, a, crackdown, on, illegal, unreported, and, unregulated, fishing, iuu, vendors, was, also, requested, international, policy, to, attempt, to, address, these, issues, is, captured, in, sustainable, development, goal, 14, life, below, water, and, its, target, 14, 4, on, sustainable, fishing, by, 2020, effectively, regulate, harvesting, and, end, overfishing, illegal, unreported, and, unregulated, fishing, and, destructive, fishing, practices, and, implement, science, based, management, plans, in, order, to, restore, fish, stocks, in, the, shortest, time, feasible, at, least, to, levels, that, can, produce, maximum, sustainable, yield, as, determined, by, their, biological, characteristics, the, marine, stewardship, council, msc, is, an, independent, non, profit, organization, which, sets, a, standard, for, sustainable, fishing, fisheries, that, wish, to, demonstrate, they, are, well, managed, and, sustainable, compared, to, the, msc, s, standards, are, assessed, by, a, team, of, experts, or, conformity, assessment, bodies, cabs, who, are, independent, of, both, the, fishery, and, the, msc
