is, popular, in, south, china, because, it, was, at, this, time, that, massive, waves, of, migration, and, settlement, led, to, a, shift, in, the, center, of, gravity, of, the, chinese, nation, away, from, the, tumult, of, the, central, plains, to, the, peaceful, lands, south, of, the, yangtze, and, on, the, southeastern, coast, leading, to, the, earnest, settlement, by, chinese, of, lands,

today, with, distinct, regional, features, the, expansion, of, the, han, people, outside, their, traditional, homeland, in, the, yellow, river, is, an, important, part, of, their, historical, consciousness, and, ethnogenesis, and, accounts, for, their, present, day, diversity, there, were, several, periods, of, mass, migration, of, han, people, to, southeastern, and, southern, china, throughout, history, initially, the, sparsely, populated, regions, of, south, china, were, inhabited, by, tribes, known, only, as, the, bai, yue, or, hundred, yue, many, of, these, tribes, developed, into, kingdoms, under, rulers, and, nobility, of, han, chinese, ethnicity, but, retained, a, bai, yue, majority, for, several, centuries, yet, others, were, forcibly, brought, into, the, sinosphere, by, the, imperial, ambitions, of, emperors, such, as, qin, shi, huangdi, and, han, wu, di, both, of, whom, settled, hundreds, of, thousands, of, chinese, in, these, lands, to, form, agricultural, colonies, and, military, garrisons, even, then, control, over, these, lands, was, tenuous, and, bai, yue, cultural, identity, remained, strong, until, sustained, waves, of, han, chinese, emigration, in, the, jin, tang, and, song, dynasties, altered, the, demographic, balance, completely, the, first, emperor, qin, shih, huang, di, is, said, to, have, sent, several, hundred, thousand, men, and, fifteen, thousand, women, to, form, agricultural, and, military, settlements, in, lingnan, present, day, guangxi, and, guangdong, under, the, leadership, of, a, general, named, zhao, tuo, the, famous, han, emperor, han, wu, di, ordered, another, two, hundred, thousand, men, were, ordered, to, build, ships, to, attack, and, colonialize, the, lingnan, region, thus, adding, to, the, population, in, guangdong, and, guangxi, the, first, urban, cornubations, in, the, region, for, example, panyu, were, created, by, han, settlers, rather, than, the, bai, yue, who, preferred, to, maintain, small, settlements, subsisting, on, swidden, agriculture, and, rice, farming, later, on, guangdong, northern, vietnam, and, yunnan, all, experienced, a, surge, in, han, chinese, migrants, during, wang, mang, s, reign, the, demographic, composition, and, culture, of, these, regions, during, this, period, could, however, scarcely, be, said, to, have, been, sinitic, outside, the, confines, of, these, agricultural, settlements, and, military, outposts, the, genesis, of, the, modern, han, people, and, their, subgroups, cannot, be, understood, apart, from, their, historical, migrations, to, the, south, resulting, in, a, depopulation, of, the, central, plains, a, fission, between, those, that, remained, and, those, that, headed, south, and, their, subsequent, fusion, with, aboriginal, tribes, south, of, the, yangtze, even, as, the, centres, of, han, chinese, culture, and, wealth, moved, from, the, yellow, river, basin, to, jiangnan, and, to, a, lesser, extent, also, to, fujian, and, guangdong, at, various, points, in, chinese, history, collapses, of, central, authority, in, the, face, of, barbarian, uprisings, or, invasions, and, the, loss, of, control, of, the, chinese, heartland, triggered, mass, migratory, waves, which, transformed, the, demographic, composition, and, cultural, identity, of, the, south, this, process, of, sustained, mass, migration, has, been, known, as, garments, and, headdresses, moving, south, y, gu, n, n, n, d, on, account, of, it, first, being, led, by, the, aristocratic, classes, such, migratory, waves, were, numerous, and, triggered, by, such, events, such, as, the, uprising, of, the, five, barbarians, during, the, jin, dynasty, 304, 316, ad, in, which, china, was, completely, overrun, by, minority, groups, previously, serving, as, vassals, and, servants, to, sima, the, royal, house, of, jin, the, an, lu, shan, rebellion, during, the, tang, dynasty, 755, 763, ad, and, the, jingkang, incident, 1127, ad, and, jin, song, wars, these, events, caused, widespread, devastation, and, even, depopulated, the, north, resulting, in, the, complete, social, and, political, breakdown, and, collapse, of, central, authority, in, the, central, plains, triggering, massive, sustained, waves, of, han, chinese, migration, into, south, china, leading, to, the, formation, of, distinct, han, lineages, who, also, likely, assimilated, the, by, now, partially, sinicized, bai, yue, in, their, midst, modern, han, chinese, subgroups, such, as, the, cantonese, the, hakka, the, henghua, the, hainanese, the, hoklo, peoples, the, gan, the, xiang, the, wu, speaking, peoples, all, claim, han, chinese, ancestry, pointing, to, official, histories, and, their, own, genealogical, records, to, support, such, claims, linguists, hypothesize, that, the, wu, and, min, varieties, of, chinese, originate, from, the, way, chinese, was, spoken, during, the, jin, while, the, yue, and, hakka, from, the, way, chinese, was, spoken, in, the, tang, and, song, about, half, a, millenia, later, the, presence, of, tai, kradai, substrates, in, these, dialects, may, have, been, due, to, the, assimilation, of, the, remaining, groups, of, bai, yue, integrating, these, lands, into, the, sinosphere, proper, the, chaos, of, the, uprising, of, the, five, barbarians, triggered, the, first, massive, movement, of, han, chinese, dominated, by, civilians, rather, than, soldiers, to, the, south, being, led, principally, by, the, aristocracy, and, the, jin, elite, thus, jiangnan, comprising, hangzhou, s, coastal, regions, and, the, yangtze, valley, were, settled, in, the, 4th, century, ad, by, families, descended, from, chinese, nobility, special, commanderies, of, immigrants, and, white, registers, were, created, for, the, massive, number, of, han, chinese, immigrating, during, this, period, which, included, notable, families, such, as, the, wang, and, the, xie, a, religious, group, known, as, the, celestial, masters, contributed, to, the, movement, jiangnan, became, the, most, populous, and, prosperous, region, of, china, the, uprising, of, the, five, barbarians, also, led, to, the, resettlement, of, fujian, the, province, of, fujian, whose, aboriginal, inhabitants, had, been, deported, to, the, central, plains, by, han, wu, di, was, now, repopulated, by, han, chinese, settlers, and, colonists, from, the, chinese, heartland, the, eight, great, surnames, were, eight, noble, families, who, migrated, from, the, central, plains, to, fujian, these, were, the, hu, he, qiu, dan, zheng, huang, chen, and, lin, clans, who, remain, there, until, this, very, day, in, the, wake, of, the, an, lu, shan, rebellion, a, further, wave, of, han, migrants, from, northern, china, headed, the, south, at, the, start, of, the, rebellion, in, 755, there, were, 52, 9, million, registered, inhabitants, of, the, tang, empire, and, after, its, end, in, 764, only, 16, 9, million, were, recorded, it, is, likely, that, the, difference, in, census, figures, was, due, to, the, complete, breakdown, in, administrative, capabilities, as, well, as, the, widespread, escape, from, the, north, by, the, han, chinese, and, their, mass, migration, to, the, south, by, now, the, han, chinese, population, in, the, south, far, outstripped, that, of, the, bai, yue, guangdong, and, fujian, both, experienced, a, significant, influx, of, northern, han, chinese, settlers, leading, many, cantonese, hokkien, and, teochew, individuals, to, identify, themselves, as, tang, people, t, ngr, n, which, has, served, as, a, means, to, assert, and, acknowledge, their, ethnic, and, cultural, origin, and, identity, the, jin, song, wars, caused, yet, another, wave, of, mass, migration, of, the, han, chinese, from, northern, china, to, southern, china, leading, to, a, further, increase, in, the, han, chinese, population, across, southern, chinese, provinces, the, formation, of, the, hainanese, and, hakka, people, can, be, attributed, to, the, chaos, of, this, period, the, mongol, invasion, during, the, thirteenth, century, once, again, caused, a, surging, influx, of, northern, han, chinese, refugees, to, move, south, to, settle, and, develop, the, pearl, river, delta, these, mass, migrations, over, the, centuries, inevitably, led, to, the, demographic, expansion, economic, prosperity, agricultural, advancements, and, cultural, flourishing, of, southern, china, which, remained, relatively, peaceful, unlike, its, northern, counterpart, the, vast, majority, of, han, chinese, over, 1, 2, billion, live, in, the,

various, traditional, homegrown, chinese, philosophies, have, influenced, not, only, han, chinese, culture, but, also, the, neighboring, cultures, in, east, asia, chinese, spiritual, culture, has, been, long, characterized, by, religious, pluralism, and, chinese, folk, religion, has, always, maintained, a, profound, influence, within, the, confines, of, chinese, civilization, both, historically, and, in, the, modern, era, indigenous, confucianism, and, taoism, share, aspects, of, being, a, philosophy, or, a, religion, and, neither, demand, exclusive, adherence, resulting, in, a, culture, of, tolerance, and, syncretism, where, multiple, religions, or, belief, systems, are, often, practiced, in, conjunction, with, local, customs, and, traditions, han, culture, has, for, long, been, influenced, by, mahayana, buddhism, while, in, recent, centuries, christianity, has, also, gained, a, foothold, among, the, population, chinese, folk, religion, is, a, set, of, worship, traditions, of, the, ethnic, deities, of, the, han, people, it, involves, the, worship, of, various, extraordinary, figures, in, chinese, mythology, and, history, heroic, personnel, such, as, guan, yu, and, qu, yuan, mythological, creatures, such, as, the, chinese, dragon, or, family, clan, and, national, ancestors, these, practices, vary, from, region, to, region, and, do, not, characterize, an, organized, religion, though, many, traditional, chinese, holidays, such, as, the, duanwu, or, dragon, boat, festival, qingming, festival, zhongyuan, festival, and, the, mid, autumn, festival, come, from, the, most, popular, of, these, traditions, taoism, another, indigenous, han, philosophy, and, religion, is, also, widely, practiced, by, the, han, in, both, its, folk, forms, and, as, an, organized, religion, with, its, traditions, having, been, a, source, of, vestigial, perennial, influence, on, chinese, art, poetry, philosophy, music, medicine, astronomy, neidan, and, alchemy, dietary, habits, neijia, and, other, martial, arts, and, architecture, taoism, was, the, state, religion, during, the, han, and, tang, eras, where, it, also, often, enjoyed, state, patronage, under, subsequent, emperors, and, successive, ruling, dynasties, confucianism, although, sometimes, described, as, a, religion, is, another, indigenous, governing, philosophy, and, moral, code, with, some, religious, elements, like, ancestor, worship, it, continues, to, be, deeply, ingrained, in, modern, chinese, culture, and, was, the, official, state, philosophy, in, ancient, china, during, the, han, dynasty, and, until, the, fall, of, imperial, china, in, the, 20th, century, though, it, is, worth, noting, that, there, is, a, movement, in, china, today, advocating, that, the, culture, be, re, confucianized, during, the, han, dynasty, confucian, ideals, were, the, dominant, ideology, near, the, end, of, the, dynasty, buddhism, entered, china, later, gaining, popularity, historically, buddhism, alternated, between, periods, of, state, tolerance, and, even, patronage, and, persecution, in, its, original, form, certain, ideas, in, buddhism, was, not, quite, compatible, with, traditional, chinese, cultural, values, especially, with, the, confucian, sociopolitical, elite, as, certain, buddhist, values, conflicted, with, chinese, sensibilities, however, through, centuries, of, mutual, tolerance, assimilation, adaptation, and, syncretism, chinese, buddhism, gained, an, respectable, place, in, the, culture, chinese, buddhism, was, also, influenced, by, confucianism, and, taoism, and, exerted, influence, in, turn, such, as, in, the, form, of, neo, confucianism, and, buddhist, influences, in, chinese, folk, religion, such, as, the, cult, of, guanyin, who, is, treated, as, a, bodhisattva, immortal, goddess, or, exemplar, of, confucian, virtue, depending, on, the, tradition, the, four, largest, schools, of, han, buddhism, chan, jingtu, tiantai, and, huayan, were, all, developed, in, china, and, later, spread, throughout, the, chinese, sphere, of, influence, though, christian, influence, in, china, existed, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, christianity, did, not, gain, a, significant, foothold, in, china, until, the, establishment, of, contact, with, europeans, during, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, christian, beliefs, often, had, conflicts, with, traditional, chinese, values, and, customs, which, eventually, resulted, in, the, chinese, rites, controversy, and, a, subsequent, reduction, in, christian, influence, in, the, country, christianity, grew, considerably, following, the, first, opium, war, after, which, foreign, missionaries, in, china, enjoyed, the, protection, of, the, western, powers, and, engaged, in, widespread, proselytizing, the, people, s, republic, of, china, government, unprecedentedly, defined, han, chinese, muslims, as, a, separate, ethnic, group, the, hui, people, this, was, opposed, by, the, republic, of, china, government, and, han, chinese, muslim, celebrities, such, as, bai, chongxi, the, founder, of, the, chinese, muslim, association, han, chinese, muslims, were, categorised, as, inland, nationals, with, special, living, customs, under, the, republic, of, china, government, bai, chongxi, believed, that, hui, is, an, alternative, name, for, islam, as, a, religion, in, the, chinese, language, instead, of, the, name, for, any, ethnic, group, and, that, han, chinese, muslims, should, not, be, considered, as, a, separate, ethnic, group, apart, from, other, han, chinese, the, internal, genetic, structure, of, the, han, chinese, is, consistent, with, the, vast, geographical, expanse, of, china, and, the, recorded, history, of, large, migratory, waves, over, the, past, several, millennia, have, engendered, the, emergence, of, the, diverse, han, subgroups, displaying, slight, but, discernible, physical, and, physiological, differences, although, genetically, similar, han, chinese, subgroups, exhibit, a, north, south, stratification, in, their, genetics, with, centrally, placed, populations, acting, as, conduits, for, outlying, ones, although, a, genetic, north, south, cline, can, be, demonstrated, many, studies, simply, conveniently, categorize, the, han, chinese, into, two, subgroups, northern, and, southern, han, chinese, variation, notwithstanding, han, chinese, subgroups, are, genetically, closer, to, each, other, than, they, each, are, to, their, korean, and, yamato, neighbors, to, whom, they, are, also, genetically, close, in, general, the, close, genetic, relationship, between, the, han, across, the, entirety, of, china, has, led, to, their, characterization, as, having, a, coherent, genetic, structure, the, two, notable, exceptions, to, this, structure, are, pinghua, and, tanka, people, who, on, their, patrilines, bear, a, closer, genetic, resemblance, to, aboriginal, peoples, but, have, han, matrilines, the, tanka, are, a, group, of, boat, dwellers, who, speak, a, sinitic, language, and, who, claim, han, ancestry, but, who, have, traditionally, faced, severe, discrimination, from, the, other, southern, han, subgroups, unlike, the, guangdong, fujian, and, hainan, han, whose, dominant, y, chromosome, haplotype, is, the, han, patriline, o2, m122, the, tanka, have, been, shown, instead, to, have, a, predominantly, non, han, patriline, similar, to, daic, peoples, from, guizhou, however, matrilineally, the, tanka, are, closely, clustered, with, the, hakka, han, and, teochew, han, rather, than, with, austronesian, or, austroasiatic, populations, thus, supporting, an, admixture, hypothesis, and, validating, even, if, only, partially, their, own, claims, to, han, ancestry, han, chinese, in, fujian, and, guangdong, also, show, excessive, ancestries, from, late, neolithic, fujianese, sources, 35, 0, 40, 3, which, are, more, significant, in, modern, ami, atayal, and, kankanaey, 66, 9, 74, 3, and, less, significant, in, han, chinese, from, zhejiang, 22, jiangsu, 17, and, shandong, 8, the, estimated, contribution, of, northern, han, to, the, southern, han, is, substantial, in, the, paternal, ancestral, lineages, in, addition, to, a, geographic, cline, that, exists, for, its, corresponding, maternal, ancestry, these, genetic, findings, are, in, concord, with, historical, records, confirming, the, continuous, and, large, migratory, waves, of, northern, han, chinese, inhabitants, escaping, dynastic, changes, geopolitical, upheavals, instability, warfare, and, famine, into, what, is, now, today, modern, southern, china, these, successive, waves, of, han, migration, to, the, south, subsequent, intermarriage, and, cultural, mixing, between, the, northern, han, migrants, and, the, non, han, aborigines, over, the, past, two, thousand, years, gave, rise, to, modern, chinese, demographics, a, han, chinese, super, majority, and, minority, non, han, chinese, indigenous, peoples, according, to, yang, et, al, 2020, northern, han, populations, have, 36, 41, southern, east, asian, related, ancestry, whilst, southern, east, asian, mainland, populations, have, 21, 55, northern, east, asian, related, ancestry, this, admixture, was, already, present, since, the, late, neolithic, although, in, general, present, day, southern, east, asians, cluster, with, coastal, neolithic, southern, east, asians, e, g, qihe, likewise, present, day, northern, east, asians, cluster, with, coastal, neolithic, northern, east, asians, e, g, bianbian, typical, y, dna, haplogroups, of, present, day, han, chinese, include, haplogroup, o, m95, haplogroup, o, m122, haplogroup, o, m175, c, haplogroup, n, haplogroup, n, m231, and, haplogroup, q, m120, the, y, chromosome, haplogroup, distribution, between, southern, han, chinese, and, northern, han, chinese, populations, and, principal, core, component, analysis, indicates, that, almost, all, modern, han, chinese, populations, form, a, tight, cluster, in, their, y, chromosome, patrilineal, dna, indicates, the, northern, han, chinese, were, the, primary, contributors, to, the, paternal, gene, pool, of, modern, southern, han, chinese, the, data, also, indicates, that, the, contribution, of, southern, non, han, aboriginals, to, the, southern, han, chinese, genetics, is, limited, in, short, male, han, chinese, were, the, primary, drivers, of, han, chinese, expansion, in, successive, migratory, waves, from, the, north, into, what, is, now, modern, southern, china, as, is, shown, by, a, greater, contribution, to, the, y, chromosome, than, the, mtdna, from, northern, to, southern, han, during, the, zhou, dynasty, or, earlier, peoples, with, haplogroup, q, m120, also, contributed, to, the, ethnogenesis, of, han, chinese, people, this, haplogroup, is, implied, to, be, spread, across, in, the, eurasian, steppe, and, north, asia, since, it, is, found, among, cimmerians, in, moldova, and, bronze, age, natives, of, kh, vsg, l, but, it, is, currently, near, absent, in, these, regions, except, for, east, asia, in, modern, china, haplogroup, q, m120, can, be, found, in, the, northern, and, eastern, regions, matrilineal, dna, mtdna, of, han, chinese, increases, in, diversity, as, one, looks, from, northern, to, southern, china, which, suggests, that, the, influx, of, male, han, chinese, migrants, intermarried, with, the, local, female, non, han, aborigines, after, arriving, in, what, is, now, modern, day, fujian, guangdong, guangxi, hainan, and, other, regions, of, southern, china, in, these, populations, the, contribution, to, mtdna, from, han, chinese, and, indigenous, tribes, is, evenly, matched, representing, a, substantial, mtdna, contribution, from, non, han, groups, collectively, known, as, the, bai, yue, or, hundred, yue, a, study, by, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, into, the, gene, frequency, data, of, han, sub, populations, and, ethnic, minorities, in, china, showed, that, han, sub, populations, in, different, regions, are, also, genetically, quite, close, to, the, local, ethnic, non, han, minorities, meaning, that, in, many, cases, the, blood, of, ethnic, minorities, had, mixed, into, han, genetic, substrate, through, varying, degrees, of, intermarriage, while, at, the, same, time, the, blood, of, the, han, had, also, mixed, into, the, genetic, substrates, of, the, local, ethnic, non, han, minorities, the, hengbei, archaeological, site, in, jiang, county, southern, shanxi, was, part, of, the, suburbs, of, the, capital, during, the, zhou, dynasty, genetic, material, from, human, remains, in, hengbei, have, been, used, to, examine, the, genetic, continuity, between, ancient, and, modern, han, chinese, comparisons, of, y, chromosome, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, snps, and, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, between, modern, northern, han, chinese, and, 3000, year, old, hengbei, samples, reveal, extreme, similarity, confirming, genetic, continuity, between, ancient, hengbei, inhabitants, to, present, day, northern, han, chinese, this, shows, that, the, core, genetic, structure, of, northern, han, chinese, was, established, more, than, three, thousand, years, ago, in, the, central, plains, area, additionally, these, studies, indicate, that, contemporary, northern, and, southern, han, chinese, populations, exhibit, an, almost, identical, y, dna, genetic, structure, a, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, from, yinxu, commoner, graves, in, the, shang, dynasty, showed, similarity, with, modern, northern, han, chinese, but, significant, differences, from, southern, han, chinese, the, han, chinese, show, a, close, yet, distinguishable, genetic, relationship, with, other, east, asian, populations, such, as, the, koreans, and, yamato, although, the, genetic, relationship, is, close, the, various, han, chinese, subgroups, are, genetically, closer, to, each, other, than, to, their, korean, and, yamato, counterparts, other, research, suggests, a, significant, overlap, between, yamato, japanese, and, the, northern, han, chinese, in, particular, media, related, to, han, chinese, people, at, wikimedia, commons
