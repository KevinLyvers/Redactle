may, be, organised, and, maintained, by, a, public, body, such, as, a, government, an, institution, such, as, a, school, or, museum, a, corporation, or, a, private, individual, in, addition, to, providing, materials, libraries, also, provide, the, services, of, librarians, who, are, trained, experts, in, finding, selecting, circulating, and, organising, information, while, interpreting, information, needs, and, navigating, and, analysing, large, amounts, of, information, with, a, variety, of, resources, the, area, of, study, is, known, as, library, and, information, science, library, buildings, often, provide, quiet, areas, for, studying, as, well, as, common, areas, for, group, study, and, collaboration, and, may, provide, public, facilities, for, access, to, their, electronic,

different, needs, from, those, of, a, special, library, or, academic, library, for, example, libraries, may, also, be, community, hubs, where, programmes, are, made, available, and, people, engage, in, lifelong, learning, modern, libraries, extend, their, services, beyond, the, physical, walls, of, the, building, by, providing, material, accessible, by, electronic, means, including, from, home, via, the, internet, the, services, that, libraries, offer, are, variously, described, as, library, services, information, services, or, the, combination, library, and, information, services, although, different, institutions, and, sources, define, such, terminology, differently, the, term, library, is, based, on, the, latin, word, liber, for, book, or, document, contained, in, latin, libraria, collection, of, books, and, librarium, container, for, books, other, modern, languages, use, derivations, from, ancient, greek, biblioth, k, originally, meaning, book, container, via, latin, bibliotheca, cf, french, biblioth, que, or, german, bibliothek, the, history, of, libraries, began, with, the, first, efforts, to, organize, collections, of, documents, the, first, libraries, consisted, of, archives, of, the, earliest, form, of, writing, the, clay, tablets, in, cuneiform, script, discovered, in, sumer, some, dating, back, to, 2600, bc, private, or, personal, libraries,

mediterranean, world, remained, those, of, constantinople, and, alexandria, the, fatimids, r, 909, 1171, also, possessed, many, great, libraries, within, their, domains, the, historian, ibn, abi, tayyi, describes, their, palace, library, which, probably, contained, the, largest, collection, of, literature, on, earth, at, the, time, as, a, wonder, of, the, world, throughout, history, along, with, bloody, massacres, the, destruction, of, libraries, has, been, critical, for, conquerors, who, wish, to, destroy, every, trace, of, the, vanquished, community, s, recorded, memory, a, prominent, example, of, this, can, be, found, in, the, mongol, massacre, of, the, nizaris, at, alamut, in, 1256, and, the, torching, of, their, library, the, fame, of, which, boasts, the, conqueror, juwayni, had, spread, throughout, the, world, the, libraries, of, timbuktu, were, established, in, the, fourteenth, century, and, attracted, scholars, from, all, over, the, world, libraries, may, provide,

access, to, their, electronic, resources, and, the, internet, public, and, institutional, collections, and, services, may, be, intended, for, use, by, people, who, choose, not, to, or, cannot, afford, to, purchase, an, extensive, collection, themselves, who, need, material, no, individual, can, reasonably, be, expected, to, have, or, who, require, professional, assistance, with, their, research, services, offered, by, a, library, are, variously, described, as, library, services, information, services, or, the, combination, library, and, information, services, although, different, institutions, and, sources, define, such, terminology, differently, organizations, or, departments, are, often, called, by, one, of, these, names, most, libraries, have, materials, arranged, in, a, specified, order, according, to, a, library, classification, system, so, that, items, may, be, located, quickly, and, collections, browsed, efficiently, some, libraries, have, additional, galleries, beyond, the, public, ones, where, reference, materials, are, stored, these, reference, stacks, may, be, open, to, selected, members, of, the, public, while, others, may, require, patrons, to, submit, a, stack, request, a, request, for, an, assistant, to, retrieve, the, material, from, the, closed, stacks, see, list, of, closed, stack, libraries, larger, libraries, are, often, divided, into, departments, staffed, by, both, paraprofessionals, and, professional, librarians, their, department, names, and, occupational, designations, may, change, depending, on, their, location, and, the, needs, of, the, library, basic, tasks, in, library, management, include, planning, acquisitions, which, materials, the, library, should, acquire, by, purchase, or, otherwise, classifying, and, preserving, items, especially, rare, and, fragile, archival, materials, such, as, manuscripts, deaccessioning, materials, patron, borrowing, and, developing, and, administering, library, computer, systems, and, technology, more, long, term, issues, include, planning, the, construction, of, new, libraries, or, extensions, to, existing, ones, and, the, development, and, implementation, of, outreach, services, and, reading, enhancement, services, such, as, adult, literacy, and, children, s, programming, library, materials, like, books, magazines, periodicals, cds, etc, are, managed, using, a, library, classification, system, such, as, the, dewey, decimal, classification, theory, though, libraries, will, usually, adjust, their, classification, system, to, fit, their, needs, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, has, published, several, standards, regarding, the, management, of, libraries, through, its, technical, committee, 46, tc, 46, which, is, focused, on, libraries, documentation, and, information, centers, publishing, archives, records, management, museum, documentation, indexing, and, abstracting, services, and, information, science, the, following, is, a, partial, list, of, some, of, them, some, patrons, may, not, know, how, to, fully, utilize, library, resources, or, feel, unease, in, approaching, a, staff, member, ways, in, which, a, library, s, content, is, displayed, or, accessed, may, have, an, impact, on, use, an, antiquated, or, clumsy, search, system, or, staff, unwilling, or, not, properly, trained, to, engage, their, patrons, will, limit, a, library, s, usefulness, in, the, public, libraries, of, the, united, states, beginning, in, the, 19th, century, these, problems, drove, the, emergence, of, the, library, instruction, movement, which, advocated, library, user, education, one, of, the, early, leaders, was, john, cotton, dana, the, basic, form, of, library, instruction, is, sometimes, known, as, information, literacy, libraries, should, inform, their, users, of, what, materials, are, available, in, their, collections, and, how, to, access, that, information, before, the, computer, age, this, was, accomplished, by, the, card, catalogue, a, cabinet, or, multiple, cabinets, containing, many, drawers, filled, with, index, cards, that, identified, books, and, other, materials, in, a, large, library, the, card, catalogue, often, filled, a, large, room, the, emergence, of, desktop, computers, and, the, internet, however, has, led, to, the, adoption, of, electronic, catalogue, databases, often, referred, to, as, webcats, or, as, online, public, access, catalogues, opacs, which, allow, users, to, search, the, library, s, holdings, from, any, location, with, internet, access, this, style, of, catalogue, maintenance, is, compatible, with, new, types, of, libraries, such, as, digital, libraries, and, distributed, libraries, as, well, as, older, libraries, that, have, been, retrofitted, large, libraries, may, be, scattered, within, multiple, buildings, across, a, town, each, having, multiple, floors, with, multiple, rooms, housing, their, resources, across, a, series, of, shelves, called, bays, once, a, user, has, located, a, resource, within, the, catalogue, they, must, then, use, navigational, guidance, to, retrieve, the, resource, physically, a, process, that, may, be, assisted, through, signage, maps, gps, systems, or, rfid, tagging, finland, has, the, highest, number, of, registered, book, borrowers, per, capita, in, the, world, over, half, of, finland, s, population, are, registered, borrowers, in, the, us, public, library, users, have, borrowed, on, average, roughly, 15, books, per, user, per, year, from, 1856, to, 1978, from, 1978, to, 2004, book, circulation, per, user, declined, approximately, 50, the, growth, of, audiovisuals, circulation, estimated, at, 25, of, total, circulation, in, 2004, accounts, for, about, half, of, this, decline, a, library, may, make, use, of, the, internet, in, a, number, of, ways, from, creating, its, own, library, website, to, making, the, contents, of, its, catalogues, searchable, online, some, specialised, search, engines, such, as, google, scholar, offer, a, way, to, facilitate, searching, for, academic, resources, such, as, journal, articles, and, research, papers, the, online, computer, library, center, allows, anyone, to, search, the, world, s, largest, repository, of, library, records, through, its, worldcat, online, database, websites, such, as, librarything, and, amazon, provide, abstracts, reviews, and, recommendations, of, books, libraries, provide, computers, and, internet, access, to, allow, people, to, search, for, information, online, online, information, access, is, particularly, attractive, to, younger, library, users, digitization, of, books, particularly, those, that, are, out, of, print, in, projects, such, as, google, books, provides, resources, for, library, and, other, online, users, due, to, their, holdings, of, valuable, material, some, libraries, are, important, partners, for, search, engines, such, as, google, in, realizing, the, potential, of, such, projects, and, have, received, reciprocal, benefits, in, cases, where, they, have, negotiated, effectively, as, the, prominence, of, and, reliance, on, the, internet, has, grown, library, services, have, moved, the, emphasis, from, mainly, providing, print, resources, to, providing, more, computers, and, more, internet, access, libraries, face, a, number, of, challenges, in, adapting, to, new, ways, of, information, seeking, that, may, stress, convenience, over, quality, reducing, the, priority, of, information, literacy, skills, the, potential, decline, in, library, usage, particularly, reference, services, puts, the, necessity, for, these, services, in, doubt, library, scholars, have, acknowledged, that, libraries, need, to, address, the, ways, that, they, market, their, services, if, they, are, to, compete, with, the, internet, and, mitigate, the, risk, of, losing, users, this, includes, promoting, the, information, literacy, skills, training, considered, vital, across, the, library, profession, many, us, based, research, librarians, rely, on, the, acrl, framework, for, information, literacy, in, order, to, guide, students, and, faculty, in, research, however, marketing, of, services, has, to, be, adequately, supported, financially, in, order, to, be, successful, this, can, be, problematic, for, library, services, that, are, publicly, funded, and, find, it, difficult, to, justify, diverting, tight, funds, to, apparently, peripheral, areas, such, as, branding, and, marketing, the, privacy, aspect, of, library, usage, in, the, internet, age, is, a, matter, of, growing, concern, and, advocacy, privacy, workshops, are, run, by, the, library, freedom, project, which, teach, librarians, about, digital, tools, such, as, the, tor, network, to, thwart, mass, surveillance, libraries, can, have, several, different, spaces, for, different, functions, such, as, libraries, are, usually, staffed, by, a, combination, of, professionally, trained, librarians, paraprofessional, staff, sometimes, called, library, technicians, and, support, staff, some, topics, related, to, the, education, of, librarians, and, allied, staff, include, accessibility, of, the, collection, acquisition, of, materials, arrangement, and, finding, tools, the, book, trade, the, influence, of, the, physical, properties, of, the, different, writing, materials, language, distribution, role, in, education, rates, of, literacy, budgets, staffing, libraries, for, specially, targeted, audiences, architectural, merit, patterns, of, usage, the, role, of, libraries, in, a, nation, s, cultural, heritage, and, the, role, of, government, church, or, private, sponsorship, since, the, 1960s, issues, of, computerization, and, digitization, have, arisen, many, institutions, make, a, distinction, between, a, circulating, or, lending, library, where, materials, are, expected, and, intended, to, be, loaned, to, patrons, institutions, or, other, libraries, and, a, reference, library, where, material, is, not, lent, out, travelling, libraries, such, as, the, early, horseback, libraries, of, eastern, kentucky, and, bookmobiles, are, generally, of, the, lending, type, modern, libraries, are, often, a, mixture, of, both, containing, a, general, collection, for, circulation, and, a, reference, collection, which, is, restricted, to, the, library, premises, also, increasingly, digital, collections, enable, broader, access, to, material, that, may, not, circulate, in, print, and, enables, libraries, to, expand, their, collections, even, without, building, a, larger, facility, lamba, 2019, reinforced, this, idea, by, observing, that, today, s, libraries, have, become, increasingly, multi, disciplinary, collaborative, and, networked, and, that, applying, web, 2, 0, tools, to, libraries, would, not, only, connect, the, users, with, their, community, and, enhance, communication, but, will, also, help, the, librarians, to, promote, their, library, s, activities, services, and, products, to, target, both, their, actual, and, potential, users, academic, libraries, are, generally, located, on, college, and, university, campuses, and, primarily, serve, the, students, and, faculty, of, that, and, other, academic, institutions, some, academic, libraries, especially, those, at, public, institutions, are, accessible, to, members, of, the, general, public, in, whole, or, in, part, library, services, are, sometimes, extended, to, the, general, public, at, a, fee, some, academic, libraries, create, such, services, in, order, to, enhance, literacy, levels, in, their, communities, academic, libraries, are, libraries, that, are, hosted, in, post, secondary, educational, institutions, such, as, colleges, and, universities, their, main, functions, are, to, provide, support, in, research, consultancy, and, resource, linkage, for, students, and, faculty, of, the, educational, institution, academic, libraries, house, current, reliable, and, relevant, information, resources, spread, through, all, the, disciplines, which, serve, to, assuage, the, information, requirements, of, students, and, faculty, in, cases, where, not, all, books, are, housed, some, libraries, have, e, resources, where, they, subscribe, for, a, given, institution, they, are, serving, in, order, to, provide, backups, and, additional, information, that, is, not, practical, to, have, available, as, hard, copies, furthermore, most, libraries, collaborate, with, other, libraries, in, exchange, of, books, specific, course, related, resources, are, usually, provided, by, the, library, such, as, copies, of, textbooks, and, article, readings, held, on, reserve, meaning, that, they, are, loaned, out, only, on, a, short, term, basis, usually, a, matter, of, hours, some, academic, libraries, provide, resources, not, usually, associated, with, libraries, such, as, the, ability, to, check, out, laptop, computers, web, cameras, or, scientific, calculators, academic, libraries, offer, workshops, and, courses, outside, of, formal, graded, coursework, which, are, meant, to, provide, students, with, the, tools, necessary, to, succeed, in, their, programs, these, workshops, may, include, help, with, citations, effective, search, techniques, journal, databases, and, electronic, citation, software, these, workshops, provide, students, with, skills, that, can, help, them, achieve, success, in, their, academic, careers, and, often, in, their, future, occupations, which, they, may, not, learn, inside, the, classroom, the, academic, library, provides, a, quiet, study, space, for, students, on, campus, it, may, also, provide, group, study, space, such, as, meeting, rooms, in, north, america, europe, and, other, parts, of, the, world, academic, libraries, are, becoming, increasingly, digitally, oriented, the, library, provides, a, gateway, for, students, and, researchers, to, access, various, resources, both, print, physical, and, digital, academic, institutions, are, subscribing, to, electronic, journals, databases, providing, research, and, scholarly, writing, software, and, usually, provide, computer, workstations, or, computer, labs, for, students, to, access, journals, library, search, databases, and, portals, institutional, electronic, resources, internet, access, and, course, or, task, related, software, i, e, word, processing, and, spreadsheet, software, some, academic, libraries, take, on, new, roles, for, instance, acting, as, an, electronic, repository, for, institutional, scholarly, research, and, academic, knowledge, such, as, the, collection, and, curation, of, digital, copies, of, students, theses, and, dissertations, moreover, academic, libraries, are, increasingly, acting, as, publishers, on, their, own, on, a, not, for, profit, basis, especially, in, the, form, of, fully, open, access, institutional, publishers, children, s, libraries, are, special, collections, of, books, intended, for, juvenile, readers, and, usually, kept, in, separate, rooms, of, general, public, libraries, some, children, s, libraries, have, entire, floors, or, wings, dedicated, to, them, in, bigger, libraries, while, smaller, ones, may, have, a, separate, room, or, area, for, children, they, are, an, educational, agency, seeking, to, acquaint, the, young, with, the, world, s, literature, and, to, cultivate, a, love, for, reading, their, work, supplements, that, of, the, public, schools, services, commonly, provided, by, public, libraries, may, include, storytelling, sessions, for, infants, toddlers, preschool, children, or, after, school, programs, all, with, an, intention, of, developing, early, literacy, skills, and, a, love, of, books, one, of, the, most, popular, programs, offered, in, public, libraries, are, summer, reading, programs, for, children, families, and, adults, another, popular, reading, program, for, children, is, paws, to, read, or, similar, programs, where, children, can, read, to, certified, therapy, dogs, since, animals, are, a, calming, influence, and, there, is, no, judgment, children, learn, confidence, and, a, love, of, reading, many, states, have, these, types, of, programs, parents, need, simply, ask, their, librarian, to, see, if, it, is, available, at, their, local, library, a, national, or, state, library, serves, as, a, national, repository, of, information, and, has, the, right, of, legal, deposit, which, is, a, legal, requirement, that, publishers, in, the, country, need, to, deposit, a, copy, of, each, publication, with, the, library, unlike, a, public, library, a, national, library, rarely, allows, citizens, to, borrow, books, often, their, collections, include, numerous, rare, valuable, or, significant, works, there, are, wider, definitions, of, a, national, library, putting, less, emphasis, on, the, repository, character, the, first, national, libraries, had, their, origins, in, the, royal, collections, of, the, sovereign, or, some, other, supreme, body, of, the, state, many, national, libraries, cooperate, within, the, national, libraries, section, of, the, international, federation, of, library, associations, and, institutions, ifla, to, discuss, their, common, tasks, define, and, promote, common, standards, and, carry, out, projects, helping, them, to, fulfill, their, duties, the, national, libraries, of, europe, participate, in, the, european, library, which, is, a, service, of, the, conference, of, european, national, librarians, cenl, a, public, library, provides, services, to, the, general, public, if, the, library, is, part, of, a, countywide, library, system, citizens, with, an, active, library, card, from, around, that, county, can, use, the, library, branches, associated, with, the, library, system, a, library, can, serve, only, their, city, however, if, they, are, not, a, member, of, the, county, public, library, system, much, of, the, materials, located, within, a, public, library, are, available, for, borrowing, the, library, staff, decides, upon, the, number, of, items, patrons, are, allowed, to, borrow, as, well, as, the, details, of, borrowing, time, allotted, typically, libraries, issue, library, cards, to, community, members, wishing, to, borrow, books, often, visitors, to, a, city, are, able, to, obtain, a, public, library, card, many, public, libraries, also, serve, as, community, organizations, that, provide, free, services, and, events, to, the, public, such, as, reading, groups, and, toddler, story, time, for, many, communities, the, library, is, a, source, of, connection, to, a, vast, world, obtainable, knowledge, and, understanding, and, entertainment, according, to, a, study, by, the, pennsylvania, library, association, public, library, services, play, a, major, role, in, fighting, rising, illiteracy, rates, among, youths, public, libraries, are, protected, and, funded, by, the, public, they, serve, as, the, number, of, books, in, libraries, have, steadily, increased, since, their, inception, the, need, for, compact, storage, and, access, with, adequate, lighting, has, grown, the, stack, system, involves, keeping, a, library, s, collection, of, books, in, a, space, separate, from, the, reading, room, this, arrangement, arose, in, the, 19th, century, book, stacks, quickly, evolved, into, a, fairly, standard, form, in, which, the, cast, iron, and, steel, frameworks, supporting, the, bookshelves, also, supported, the, floors, which, often, were, built, of, translucent, blocks, to, permit, the, passage, of, light, but, were, not, transparent, for, reasons, of, modesty, the, introduction, of, electric, lights, had, a, huge, impact, on, lighting, in, libraries, the, use, of, glass, floors, was, largely, discontinued, though, floors, were, still, often, composed, of, metal, grating, to, allow, air, to, circulate, in, multi, story, stacks, as, more, space, was, needed, a, method, of, moving, shelves, on, tracks, compact, shelving, was, introduced, to, cut, down, on, otherwise, wasted, aisle, space, library, 2, 0, a, term, coined, in, 2005, is, the, library, s, response, to, the, challenge, of, google, and, an, attempt, to, meet, the, changing, needs, of, users, by, using, web, 2, 0, technology, some, of, the, aspects, of, library, 2, 0, include, commenting, tagging, bookmarking, discussions, use, of, online, social, networks, by, libraries, plug, ins, and, widgets, inspired, by, web, 2, 0, it, is, an, attempt, to, make, the, library, a, more, user, driven, institution, despite, the, importance, ascribed, to, public, libraries, their, budgets, are, often, cut, by, legislatures, in, some, cases, funding, has, dwindled, so, much, that, libraries, have, been, forced, to, cut, their, hours, and, release, employees, a, reference, library, does, not, lend, books, and, other, items, instead, they, can, only, be, read, at, the, library, itself, typically, such, libraries, are, used, for, research, purposes, for, example, at, a, university, some, items, at, reference, libraries, may, be, historical, and, even, unique, many, lending, libraries, contain, a, reference, section, which, holds, books, such, as, dictionaries, which, are, common, reference, books, and, are, therefore, not, lent, out, such, reference, sections, may, be, referred, to, as, reading, rooms, or, study, rooms, which, may, also, include, newspapers, and, periodicals, an, example, of, a, reading, room, is, the, hazel, h, ransom, reading, room, at, the, harry, ransom, center, of, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, which, maintains, the, papers, of, literary, agent, audrey, wood, a, research, library, is, a, collection, of, materials, on, one, or, more, subjects, a, research, library, supports, scholarly, or, scientific, research, and, will, generally, include, primary, as, well, as, secondary, sources, it, will, maintain, permanent, collections, and, attempt, to, provide, access, to, all, necessary, materials, a, research, library, is, most, often, an, academic, or, national, library, but, a, large, special, library, may, have, a, research, library, within, its, special, field, and, a, very, few, of, the, largest, public, libraries, also, serve, as, research, libraries, a, large, university, library, may, be, considered, a, research, library, and, in, north, america, such, libraries, may, belong, to, the, association, of, research, libraries, in, the, united, kingdom, they, may, be, members, of, research, libraries, uk, rluk, particularly, important, collections, in, england, may, be, designated, by, arts, council, england, a, research, library, can, be, either, a, reference, library, which, does, not, lend, its, holdings, or, a, lending, library, which, does, lend, all, or, some, of, its, holdings, some, extremely, large, or, traditional, research, libraries, are, entirely, reference, in, this, sense, lending, none, of, their, materials, most, academic, research, libraries, at, least, in, the, us, and, the, uk, now, lend, books, but, not, periodicals, or, other, materials, many, research, libraries, are, attached, to, a, parent, organization, and, may, serve, only, members, of, that, organization, examples, of, research, libraries, include, the, british, library, the, bodleian,
