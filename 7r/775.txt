perception, from, latin, perceptio, gathering, receiving, is, the, organization, identification, and, interpretation, of, sensory, information, in, order, to, represent, and, understand, the, presented, information, or, environment, all, perception, involves, signals, that, go, through, the, nervous, system, which, in, turn, result, from, physical, or, chemical, stimulation, of, the, sensory, system, vision, involves, light, striking, the, retina, of, the, eye, smell, is, mediated, by, odor, molecules, and, hearing, involves, pressure, waves, perception, is, not, only, the, passive, receipt, of, these, signals, but, it, is, also, shaped, by, the, recipient, s, learning, memory, expectation, and, attention, sensory, input, is, a, process, that, transforms, this, low, level, information, to, higher, level, information, e, g, extracts, shapes, for, object, recognition, the, following, process, connects, a, person, s, concepts, and, expectations, or, knowledge, with, restorative, and, selective, mechanisms, such, as, attention, that, influence, perception, perception, depends, on, complex, functions, of, the, nervous, system, but, subjectively, seems, mostly, effortless, because, this, processing, happens, outside, conscious, awareness, since, the, rise, of, experimental, psychology, in, the, 19th, century, psychology, s, understanding, of, perception, has, progressed, by, combining, a, variety, of, techniques, psychophysics, quantitatively, describes, the, relationships, between, the, physical, qualities, of, the, sensory, input, and, perception, sensory, neuroscience, studies, the, neural, mechanisms, underlying, perception, perceptual, systems, can, also, be, studied, computationally, in, terms, of, the, information, they, process, perceptual, issues, in, philosophy, include, the, extent, to, which, sensory, qualities, such, as, sound, smell, or, color, exist, in, objective, reality, rather, than, in, the, mind, of, the, perceiver, although, people, traditionally, viewed, the, senses, as, passive, receptors, the, study, of, illusions, and, ambiguous, images, has, demonstrated, that, the, brain, s, perceptual, systems, actively, and, pre, consciously, attempt, to, make, sense, of, their, input, there, is, still, active, debate, about, the, extent, to, which, perception, is, an, active, process, of, hypothesis, testing, analogous, to, science, or, whether, realistic, sensory, information, is, rich, enough, to, make, this, process, unnecessary, the, perceptual, systems, of, the, brain, enable, individuals, to, see, the, world, around, them, as, stable, even, though, the, sensory, information, is, typically, incomplete, and, rapidly, varying, human, and, other, animal, brains, are, structured, in, a, modular, way, with, different, areas, processing, different, kinds, of, sensory, information, some, of, these, modules, take, the, form, of, sensory, maps, mapping, some, aspect, of, the, world, across, part, of, the, brain, s, surface, these, different, modules, are, interconnected, and, influence, each, other, for, instance, taste, is, strongly, influenced, by, smell, the, process, of, perception, begins, with, an, object, in, the, real, world, known, as, the, distal, stimulus, or, distal, object, by, means, of, light, sound, or, another, physical, process, the, object, stimulates, the, body, s, sensory, organs, these, sensory, organs, transform, the, input, energy, into, neural, activity, a, process, called, transduction, this, raw, pattern, of, neural, activity, is, called, the, proximal, stimulus, these, neural, signals, are, then, transmitted, to, the, brain, and, processed, the, resulting, mental, re, creation, of, the, distal, stimulus, is, the, percept, to, explain, the, process, of, perception, an, example, could, be, an, ordinary, shoe, the, shoe, itself, is, the, distal, stimulus, when, light, from, the, shoe, enters, a, person, s, eye, and, stimulates, the, retina, that, stimulation, is, the, proximal, stimulus, the, image, of, the, shoe, reconstructed, by, the, brain, of, the, person, is, the, percept, another, example, could, be, a, ringing, telephone, the, ringing, of, the, phone, is, the, distal, stimulus, the, sound, stimulating, a, person, s, auditory, receptors, is, the, proximal, stimulus, the, brain, s, interpretation, of, this, as, the, ringing, of, a, telephone, is, the, percept, the, different, kinds, of, sensation, such, as, warmth, sound, and, taste, are, called, sensory, modalities, or, stimulus, modalities, psychologist, jerome, bruner, developed, a, model, of, perception, in, which, people, put, together, the, information, contained, in, a, target, and, a, situation, to, form, perceptions, of, ourselves, and, others, based, on, social, categories, this, model, is, composed, of, three, states, according, to, alan, saks, and, gary, johns, there, are, three, components, to, perception, stimuli, are, not, necessarily, translated, into, a, percept, and, rarely, does, a, single, stimulus, translate, into, a, percept, an, ambiguous, stimulus, may, sometimes, be, transduced, into, one, or, more, percepts, experienced, randomly, one, at, a, time, in, a, process, termed, multistable, perception, the, same, stimuli, or, absence, of, them, may, result, in, different, percepts, depending, on, subject, s, culture, and, previous, experiences, ambiguous, figures, demonstrate, that, a, single, stimulus, can, result, in, more, than, one, percept, for, example, the, rubin, vase, can, be, interpreted, either, as, a, vase, or, as, two, faces, the, percept, can, bind, sensations, from, multiple, senses, into, a, whole, a, picture, of, a, talking, person, on, a, television, screen, for, example, is, bound, to, the, sound, of, speech, from, speakers, to, form, a, percept, of, a, talking, person, in, many, ways, vision, is, the, primary, human, sense, light, is, taken, in, through, each, eye, and, focused, in, a, way, which, sorts, it, on, the, retina, according, to, direction, of, origin, a, dense, surface, of, photosensitive, cells, including, rods, cones, and, intrinsically, photosensitive, retinal, ganglion, cells, captures, information, about, the, intensity, color, and, position, of, incoming, light, some, processing, of, texture, and, movement, occurs, within, the, neurons, on, the, retina, before, the, information, is, sent, to, the, brain, in, total, about, 15, differing, types, of, information, are, then, forwarded, to, the, brain, proper, via, the, optic, nerve, the, timing, of, perception, of, a, visual, event, at, points, along, the, visual, circuit, have, been, measured, a, sudden, alteration, of, light, at, a, spot, in, the, environment, first, alters, photoreceptor, cells, in, the, retina, which, send, a, signal, to, the, retina, bipolar, cell, layer, which, in, turn, can, activate, a, retinal, ganglion, neuron, cell, a, retinal, ganglion, cell, is, a, bridging, neuron, that, connects, visual, retinal, input, to, the, visual, processing, centers, within, the, central, nervous, system, light, altered, neuron, activation, occurs, within, about, 5, 20, milliseconds, in, a, rabbit, retinal, ganglion, although, in, a, mouse, retinal, ganglion, cell, the, initial, spike, takes, between, 40, and, 240, milliseconds, before, the, initial, activation, the, initial, activation, can, be, detected, by, an, action, potential, spike, a, sudden, spike, in, neuron, membrane, electric, voltage, a, perceptual, visual, event, measured, in, humans, was, the, presentation, to, individuals, of, an, anomalous, word, if, these, individuals, are, shown, a, sentence, presented, as, a, sequence, of, single, words, on, a, computer, screen, with, a, puzzling, word, out, of, place, in, the, sequence, the, perception, of, the, puzzling, word, can, register, on, an, electroencephalogram, eeg, in, an, experiment, human, readers, wore, an, elastic, cap, with, 64, embedded, electrodes, distributed, over, their, scalp, surface, within, 230, milliseconds, of, encountering, the, anomalous, word, the, human, readers, generated, an, event, related, electrical, potential, alteration, of, their, eeg, at, the, left, occipital, temporal, channel, over, the, left, occipital, lobe, and, temporal, lobe, hearing, or, audition, is, the, ability, to, perceive, sound, by, detecting, vibrations, i, e, sonic, detection, frequencies, capable, of, being, heard, by, humans, are, called, audio, or, audible, frequencies, the, range, of, which, is, typically, considered, to, be, between, 20, hz, and, 20, 000, hz, frequencies, higher, than, audio, are, referred, to, as, ultrasonic, while, frequencies, below, audio, are, referred, to, as, infrasonic, the, auditory, system, includes, the, outer, ears, which, collect, and, filter, sound, waves, the, middle, ear, which, transforms, the, sound, pressure, impedance, matching, and, the, inner, ear, which, produces, neural, signals, in, response, to, the, sound, by, the, ascending, auditory, pathway, these, are, led, to, the, primary, auditory, cortex, within, the, temporal, lobe, of, the, human, brain, from, where, the, auditory, information, then, goes, to, the, cerebral, cortex, for, further, processing, sound, does, not, usually, come, from, a, single, source, in, real, situations, sounds, from, multiple, sources, and, directions, are, superimposed, as, they, arrive, at, the, ears, hearing, involves, the, computationally, complex, task, of, separating, out, sources, of, interest, identifying, them, and, often, estimating, their, distance, and, direction, the, process, of, recognizing, objects, through, touch, is, known, as, haptic, perception, it, involves, a, combination, of, somatosensory, perception, of, patterns, on, the, skin, surface, e, g, edges, curvature, and, texture, and, proprioception, of, hand, position, and, conformation, people, can, rapidly, and, accurately, identify, three, dimensional, objects, by, touch, this, involves, exploratory, procedures, such, as, moving, the, fingers, over, the, outer, surface, of, the, object, or, holding, the, entire, object, in, the, hand, haptic, perception, relies, on, the, forces, experienced, during, touch, professor, gibson, defined, the, haptic, system, as, the, sensibility, of, the, individual, to, the, world, adjacent, to, his, body, by, use, of, his, body, gibson, and, others, emphasized, the, close, link, between, body, movement, and, haptic, perception, where, the, latter, is, active, exploration, the, concept, of, haptic, perception, is, related, to, the, concept, of, extended, physiological, proprioception, according, to, which, when, using, a, tool, such, as, a, stick, perceptual, experience, is, transparently, transferred, to, the, end, of, the, tool, taste, formally, known, as, gustation, is, the, ability, to, perceive, the, flavor, of, substances, including, but, not, limited, to, food, humans, receive, tastes, through, sensory, organs, concentrated, on, the, upper, surface, of, the, tongue, called, taste, buds, or, gustatory, calyculi, the, human, tongue, has, 100, to, 150, taste, receptor, cells, on, each, of, its, roughly, ten, thousand, taste, buds, traditionally, there, have, been, four, primary, tastes, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and, saltiness, the, recognition, and, awareness, of, umami, which, is, considered, the, fifth, primary, taste, is, a, relatively, recent, development, in, western, cuisine, other, tastes, can, be, mimicked, by, combining, these, basic, tastes, all, of, which, contribute, only, partially, to, the, sensation, and, flavor, of, food, in, the, mouth, other, factors, include, smell, which, is, detected, by, the, olfactory, epithelium, of, the, nose, texture, which, is, detected, through, a, variety, of, mechanoreceptors, muscle, nerves, etc, and, temperature, which, is, detected, by, thermoreceptors, all, basic, tastes, are, classified, as, either, appetitive, or, aversive, depending, upon, whether, the, things, they, sense, are, harmful, or, beneficial, smell, is, the, process, of, absorbing, molecules, through, olfactory, organs, which, are, absorbed, by, humans, through, the, nose, these, molecules, diffuse, through, a, thick, layer, of, mucus, come, into, contact, with, one, of, thousands, of, cilia, that, are, projected, from, sensory, neurons, and, are, then, absorbed, into, a, receptor, one, of, 347, or, so, it, is, this, process, that, causes, humans, to, understand, the, concept, of, smell, from, a, physical, standpoint, smell, is, also, a, very, interactive, sense, as, scientists, have, begun, to, observe, that, olfaction, comes, into, contact, with, the, other, sense, in, unexpected, ways, it, is, also, the, most, primal, of, the, senses, as, it, is, known, to, be, the, first, indicator, of, safety, or, danger, therefore, being, the, sense, that, drives, the, most, basic, of, human, survival, skills, as, such, it, can, be, a, catalyst, for, human, behavior, on, a, subconscious, and, instinctive, level, social, perception, is, the, part, of, perception, that, allows, people, to, understand, the, individuals, and, groups, of, their, social, world, thus, it, is, an, element, of, social, cognition, speech, perception, is, the, process, by, which, spoken, language, is, heard, interpreted, and, understood, research, in, this, field, seeks, to, understand, how, human, listeners, recognize, the, sound, of, speech, or, phonetics, and, use, such, information, to, understand, spoken, language, listeners, manage, to, perceive, words, across, a, wide, range, of, conditions, as, the, sound, of, a, word, can, vary, widely, according, to, words, that, surround, it, and, the, tempo, of, the, speech, as, well, as, the, physical, characteristics, accent, tone, and, mood, of, the, speaker, reverberation, signifying, the, persistence, of, sound, after, the, sound, is, produced, can, also, have, a, considerable, impact, on, perception, experiments, have, shown, that, people, automatically, compensate, for, this, effect, when, hearing, speech, the, process, of, perceiving, speech, begins, at, the, level, of, the, sound, within, the, auditory, signal, and, the, process, of, audition, the, initial, auditory, signal, is, compared, with, visual, information, primarily, lip, movement, to, extract, acoustic, cues, and, phonetic, information, it, is, possible, other, sensory, modalities, are, integrated, at, this, stage, as, well, this, speech, information, can, then, be, used, for, higher, level, language, processes, such, as, word, recognition, speech, perception, is, not, necessarily, uni, directional, higher, level, language, processes, connected, with, morphology, syntax, and, or, semantics, may, also, interact, with, basic, speech, perception, processes, to, aid, in, recognition, of, speech, sounds, it, may, be, the, case, that, it, is, not, necessary, maybe, not, even, possible, for, a, listener, to, recognize, phonemes, before, recognizing, higher, units, such, as, words, in, an, experiment, professor, richard, m, warren, replaced, one, phoneme, of, a, word, with, a, cough, like, sound, his, subjects, restored, the, missing, speech, sound, perceptually, without, any, difficulty, moreover, they, were, not, able, to, accurately, identify, which, phoneme, had, even, been, disturbed, facial, perception, refers, to, cognitive, processes, specialized, in, handling, human, faces, including, perceiving, the, identity, of, an, individual, and, facial, expressions, such, as, emotional, cues, the, somatosensory, cortex, is, a, part, of, the, brain, that, receives, and, encodes, sensory, information, from, receptors, of, the, entire, body, affective, touch, is, a, type, of, sensory, information, that, elicits, an, emotional, reaction, and, is, usually, social, in, nature, such, information, is, actually, coded, differently, than, other, sensory, information, though, the, intensity, of, affective, touch, is, still, encoded, in, the, primary, somatosensory, cortex, the, feeling, of, pleasantness, associated, with, affective, touch, is, activated, more, in, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, increased, blood, oxygen, level, dependent, bold, contrast, imaging, identified, during, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, shows, that, signals, in, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, as, well, as, the, prefrontal, cortex, are, highly, correlated, with, pleasantness, scores, of, affective, touch, inhibitory, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, tms, of, the, primary, somatosensory, cortex, inhibits, the, perception, of, affective, touch, intensity, but, not, affective, touch, pleasantness, therefore, the, s1, is, not, directly, involved, in, processing, socially, affective, touch, pleasantness, but, still, plays, a, role, in, discriminating, touch, location, and, intensity, multi, modal, perception, refers, to, concurrent, stimulation, in, more, than, one, sensory, modality, and, the, effect, such, has, on, the, perception, of, events, and, objects, in, the, world, chronoception, refers, to, how, the, passage, of, time, is, perceived, and, experienced, although, the, sense, of, time, is, not, associated, with, a, specific, sensory, system, the, work, of, psychologists, and, neuroscientists, indicates, that, human, brains, do, have, a, system, governing, the, perception, of, time, composed, of, a, highly, distributed, system, involving, the, cerebral, cortex, cerebellum, and, basal, ganglia, one, particular, component, of, the, brain, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, is, responsible, for, the, circadian, rhythm, commonly, known, as, one, s, internal, clock, while, other, cell, clusters, appear, to, be, capable, of, shorter, range, timekeeping, known, as, an, ultradian, rhythm, one, or, more, dopaminergic, pathways, in, the, central, nervous, system, appear, to, have, a, strong, modulatory, influence, on, mental, chronometry, particularly, interval, timing, sense, of, agency, refers, to, the, subjective, feeling, of, having, chosen, a, particular, action, some, conditions, such, as, schizophrenia, can, cause, a, loss, of, this, sense, which, may, lead, a, person, into, delusions, such, as, feeling, like, a, machine, or, like, an, outside, source, is, controlling, them, an, opposite, extreme, can, also, occur, where, people, experience, everything, in, their, environment, as, though, they, had, decided, that, it, would, happen, even, in, non, pathological, cases, there, is, a, measurable, difference, between, the, making, of, a, decision, and, the, feeling, of, agency, through, methods, such, as, the, libet, experiment, a, gap, of, half, a, second, or, more, can, be, detected, from, the, time, when, there, are, detectable, neurological, signs, of, a, decision, having, been, made, to, the, time, when, the, subject, actually, becomes, conscious, of, the, decision, there, are, also, experiments, in, which, an, illusion, of, agency, is, induced, in, psychologically, normal, subjects, in, 1999, psychologists, wegner, and, wheatley, gave, subjects, instructions, to, move, a, mouse, around, a, scene, and, point, to, an, image, about, once, every, thirty, seconds, however, a, second, person, acting, as, a, test, subject, but, actually, a, confederate, had, their, hand, on, the, mouse, at, the, same, time, and, controlled, some, of, the, movement, experimenters, were, able, to, arrange, for, subjects, to, perceive, certain, forced, stops, as, if, they, were, their, own, choice, recognition, memory, is, sometimes, divided, into, two, functions, by, neuroscientists, familiarity, and, recollection, a, strong, sense, of, familiarity, can, occur, without, any, recollection, for, example, in, cases, of, deja, vu, the, temporal, lobe, specifically, the, perirhinal, cortex, responds, differently, to, stimuli, that, feel, novel, compared, to, stimuli, that, feel, familiar, firing, rates, in, the, perirhinal, cortex, are, connected, with, the, sense, of, familiarity, in, humans, and, other, mammals, in, tests, stimulating, this, area, at, 10, 15, hz, caused, animals, to, treat, even, novel, images, as, familiar, and, stimulation, at, 30, 40, hz, caused, novel, images, to, be, partially, treated, as, familiar, in, particular, stimulation, at, 30, 40, hz, led, to, animals, looking, at, a, familiar, image, for, longer, periods, as, they, would, for, an, unfamiliar, one, though, it, did, not, lead, to, the, same, exploration, behavior, normally, associated, with, novelty, recent, studies, on, lesions, in, the, area, concluded, that, rats, with, a, damaged, perirhinal, cortex, were, still, more, interested, in, exploring, when, novel, objects, were, present, but, seemed, unable, to, tell, novel, objects, from, familiar, ones, they, examined, both, equally, thus, other, brain, regions, are, involved, with, noticing, unfamiliarity, while, the, perirhinal, cortex, is, needed, to, associate, the, feeling, with, a, specific, source, sexual, stimulation, is, any, stimulus, including, bodily, contact, that, leads, to, enhances, and, maintains, sexual, arousal, possibly, even, leading, to, orgasm, distinct, from, the, general, sense, of, touch, sexual, stimulation, is, strongly, tied, to, hormonal, activity, and, chemical, triggers, in, the, body, although, sexual, arousal, may, arise, without, physical, stimulation, achieving, orgasm, usually, requires, physical, sexual, stimulation, stimulation, of, the, krause, finger, corpuscles, found, in, erogenous, zones, of, the, body, other, senses, enable, perception, of, body, balance, vestibular, sense, acceleration, including, gravity, position, of, body, parts, proprioception, sense, they, can, also, enable, perception, of, internal, senses, interoception, sense, such, as, temperature, pain, suffocation, gag, reflex, abdominal, distension, fullness, of, rectum, and, urinary, bladder, and, sensations, felt, in, the, throat, and, lungs, in, the, case, of, visual, perception, some, people, can, see, the, percept, shift, in, their, mind, s, eye, others, who, are, not, picture, thinkers, may, not, necessarily, perceive, the, shape, shifting, as, their, world, changes, this, esemplastic, nature, has, been, demonstrated, by, an, experiment, that, showed, that, ambiguous, images, have, multiple, interpretations, on, the, perceptual, level, the, confusing, ambiguity, of, perception, is, exploited, in, human, technologies, such, as, camouflage, and, biological, mimicry, for, example, the, wings, of, european, peacock, butterflies, bear, eyespots, that, birds, respond, to, as, though, they, were, the, eyes, of, a, dangerous, predator, there, is, also, evidence, that, the, brain, in, some, ways, operates, on, a, slight, delay, in, order, to, allow, nerve, impulses, from, distant, parts, of, the, body, to, be, integrated, into, simultaneous, signals, perception, is, one, of, the, oldest, fields, in, psychology, the, oldest, quantitative, laws, in, psychology, are, weber, s, law, which, states, that, the, smallest, noticeable, difference, in, stimulus, intensity, is, proportional, to, the, intensity, of, the, reference, and, fechner, s, law, which, quantifies, the, relationship, between, the, intensity, of, the, physical, stimulus, and, its, perceptual, counterpart, e, g, testing, how, much, darker, a, computer, screen, can, get, before, the, viewer, actually, notices, the, study, of, perception, gave, rise, to, the, gestalt, school, of, psychology, with, an, emphasis, on, a, holistic, approach, a, sensory, system, is, a, part, of, the, nervous, system, responsible, for, processing, sensory, information, a, sensory, system, consists, of, sensory, receptors, neural, pathways, and, parts, of, the, brain, involved, in, sensory, perception, commonly, recognized, sensory, systems, are, those, for, vision, hearing, somatic, sensation, touch, taste, and, olfaction, smell, as, listed, above, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, immune, system, is, an, overlooked, sensory, modality, in, short, senses, are, transducers, from, the, physical, world, to, the, realm, of, the, mind, the, receptive, field, is, the, specific, part, of, the, world, to, which, a, receptor, organ, and, receptor, cells, respond, for, instance, the, part, of, the, world, an, eye, can, see, is, its, receptive, field, the, light, that, each, rod, or, cone, can, see, is, its, receptive, field, receptive, fields, have, been, identified, for, the, visual, system, auditory, system, and, somatosensory, system, so, far, research, attention, is, currently, focused, not, only, on, external, perception, processes, but, also, to, interoception, considered, as, the, process, of, receiving, accessing, and, appraising, internal, bodily, signals, maintaining, desired, physiological, states, is, critical, for, an, organism, s, well, being, and, survival, interoception, is, an, iterative, process, requiring, the, interplay, between, perception, of, body, states, and, awareness, of, these, states, to, generate, proper, self, regulation, afferent, sensory, signals, continuously, interact, with, higher, order, cognitive, representations, of, goals, history, and, environment, shaping, emotional, experience, and, motivating, regulatory, behavior, perceptual, constancy, is, the, ability, of, perceptual, systems, to, recognize, the, same, object, from, widely, varying, sensory, inputs, 118, 120, for, example, individual, people, can, be, recognized, from, views, such, as, frontal, and, profile, which, form, very, different, shapes, on, the, retina, a, coin, looked, at, face, on, makes, a, circular, image, on, the, retina, but, when, held, at, angle, it, makes, an, elliptical, image, in, normal, perception, these, are, recognized, as, a, single, three, dimensional, object, without, this, correction, process, an, animal, approaching, from, the, distance, would, appear, to, gain, in, size, one, kind, of, perceptual, constancy, is, color, constancy, for, example, a, white, piece, of, paper, can, be, recognized, as, such, under, different, colors, and, intensities, of, light, another, example, is, roughness, constancy, when, a, hand, is, drawn, quickly, across, a, surface, the, touch, nerves, are, stimulated, more, intensely, the, brain, compensates, for, this, so, the, speed, of, contact, does, not, affect, the, perceived, roughness, other, constancies, include, melody, odor, brightness, and, words, these, constancies, are, not, always, total, but, the, variation, in, the, percept, is, much, less, than, the, variation, in, the, physical, stimulus, the, perceptual, systems, of, the, brain, achieve, perceptual, constancy, in, a, variety, of, ways, each, specialized, for, the, kind, of, information, being, processed, with, phonemic, restoration, as, a, notable, example, from, hearing, the, principles, of, grouping, or, gestalt, laws, of, grouping, are, a, set, of, principles, in, psychology, first, proposed, by, gestalt, psychologists, to, explain, how, humans, naturally, perceive, objects, with, patterns, and, objects, gestalt, psychologists, argued, that, these, principles, exist, because, the, mind, has, an, innate, disposition, to, perceive, patterns, in, the, stimulus, based, on, certain, rules, these, principles, are, organized, into, six, categories, later, research, has, identified, additional, grouping, principles, a, common, finding, across, many, different, kinds, of, perception, is, that, the, perceived, qualities, of, an, object, can, be, affected, by, the, qualities, of, context, if, one, object, is, extreme, on, some, dimension, then, neighboring, objects, are, perceived, as, further, away, from, that, extreme, simultaneous, contrast, effect, is, the, term, used, when, stimuli, are, presented, at, the, same, time, whereas, successive, contrast, applies, when, stimuli, are, presented, one, after, another, the, contrast, effect, was, noted, by, the, 17th, century, philosopher, john, locke, who, observed, that, lukewarm, water, can, feel, hot, or, cold, depending, on, whether, the, hand, touching, it, was, previously, in, hot, or, cold, water, in, the, early, 20th, century, wilhelm, wundt, identified, contrast, as, a, fundamental, principle, of, perception, and, since, then, the, effect, has, been, confirmed, in, many, different, areas, these, effects, shape, not, only, visual, qualities, like, color, and, brightness, but, other, kinds, of, perception, including, how, heavy, an, object, feels, one, experiment, found, that, thinking, of, the, name, hitler, led, to, subjects, rating, a, person, as, more, hostile, whether, a, piece, of, music, is, perceived, as, good, or, bad, can, depend, on, whether, the, music, heard, before, it, was, pleasant, or, unpleasant, for, the, effect, to, work, the, objects, being, compared, need, to, be, similar, to, each, other, a, television, reporter, can, seem, smaller, when, interviewing, a, tall, basketball, player, but, not, when, standing, next, to, a, tall, building, in, the, brain, brightness, contrast, exerts, effects, on, both, neuronal, firing, rates, and, neuronal, synchrony, cognitive, theories, of, perception, assume, there, is, a, poverty, of, the, stimulus, this, is, the, claim, that, sensations, by, themselves, are, unable, to, provide, a, unique, description, of, the, world, sensations, require, enriching, which, is, the, role, of, the, mental, model, the, perceptual, ecology, approach, was, introduced, by, professor, james, j, gibson, who, rejected, the, assumption, of, a, poverty, of, stimulus, and, the, idea, that, perception, is, based, upon, sensations, instead, gibson, investigated, what, information, is, actually, presented, to, the, perceptual, systems, his, theory, assumes, the, existence, of, stable, unbounded, and, permanent, stimulus, information, in, the, ambient, optic, array, and, it, supposes, that, the, visual, system, can, explore, and, detect, this, information, the, theory, is, information, based, not, sensation, based, he, and, the, psychologists, who, work, within, this, paradigm, detailed, how, the, world, could, be, specified, to, a, mobile, exploring, organism, via, the, lawful, projection, of, information, about, the, world, into, energy, arrays, specification, would, be, a, 1, 1, mapping, of, some, aspect, of, the, world, into, a, perceptual, array, given, such, a, mapping, no, enrichment, is, required, and, perception, is, direct, from, gibson, s, early, work, derived, an, ecological, understanding, of, perception, known, as, perception, in, action, which, argues, that, perception, is, a, requisite, property, of, animate, action, it, posits, that, without, perception, action, would, be, unguided, and, without, action, perception, would, serve, no, purpose, animate, actions, require, both, perception, and, motion, which, can, be, described, as, two, sides, of, the, same, coin, the, coin, is, action, gibson, works, from, the, assumption, that, singular, entities, which, he, calls, invariants, already, exist, in, the, real, world, and, that, all, that, the, perception, process, does, is, home, in, upon, them, the, constructivist, view, held, by, such, philosophers, as, ernst, von, glasersfeld, regards, the, continual, adjustment, of, perception, and, action, to, the, external, input, as, precisely, what, constitutes, the, entity, which, is, therefore, far, from, being, invariant, glasersfeld, considers, an, invariant, as, a, target, to, be, homed, in, upon, and, a, pragmatic, necessity, to, allow, an, initial, measure, of, understanding, to, be, established, prior, to, the, updating, that, a, statement, aims, to, achieve, the, invariant, does, not, and, need, not, represent, an, actuality, glasersfeld, describes, it, as, extremely, unlikely, that, what, is, desired, or, feared, by, an, organism, will, never, suffer, change, as, time, goes, on, this, social, constructionist, theory, thus, allows, for, a, needful, evolutionary, adjustment, a, mathematical, theory, of, perception, in, action, has, been, devised, and, investigated, in, many, forms, of, controlled, movement, and, has, been, described, in, many, different, species, of, organism, using, the, general, tau, theory, according, to, this, theory, tau, information, or, time, to, goal, information, is, the, fundamental, percept, in, perception, many, philosophers, such, as, jerry, fodor, write, that, the, purpose, of, perception, is, knowledge, however, evolutionary, psychologists, hold, that, the, primary, purpose, of, perception, is, to, guide, action, they, give, the, example, of, depth, perception, which, seems, to, have, evolved, not, to, aid, in, knowing, the, distances, to, other, objects, but, rather, to, aid, movement, evolutionary, psychologists, argue, that, animals, ranging, from, fiddler, crabs, to, humans, use, eyesight, for, collision, avoidance, suggesting, that, vision, is, basically, for, directing, action, not, providing, knowledge, neuropsychologists, showed, that, perception, systems, evolved, along, the, specifics, of, animals, activities, this, explains, why, bats, and, worms, can, perceive, different, frequency, of, auditory, and, visual, systems, than, for, example, humans, building, and, maintaining, sense, organs, is, metabolically, expensive, more, than, half, the, brain, is, devoted, to, processing, sensory, information, and, the, brain, itself, consumes, roughly, one, fourth, of, one, s, metabolic, resources, thus, such, organs, evolve, only, when, they, provide, exceptional, benefits, to, an, organism, s, fitness, scientists, who, study, perception, and, sensation, have, long, understood, the, human, senses, as, adaptations, depth, perception, consists, of, processing, over, half, a, dozen, visual, cues, each, of, which, is, based, on, a, regularity, of, the, physical, world, vision, evolved, to, respond, to, the, narrow, range, of, electromagnetic, energy, that, is, plentiful, and, that, does, not, pass, through, objects, sound, waves, provide, useful, information, about, the, sources, of, and, distances, to, objects, with, larger, animals, making, and, hearing, lower, frequency, sounds, and, smaller, animals, making, and, hearing, higher, frequency, sounds, taste, and, smell, respond, to, chemicals, in, the, environment, that, were, significant, for, fitness, in, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, the, sense, of, touch, is, actually, many, senses, including, pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and, pain, pain, while, unpleasant, is, adaptive, an, important, adaptation, for, senses, is, range, shifting, by, which, the, organism, becomes, temporarily, more, or, less, sensitive, to, sensation, for, example, one, s, eyes, automatically, adjust, to, dim, or, bright, ambient, light, sensory, abilities, of, different, organisms, often, co, evolve, as, is, the, case, with, the, hearing, of, echolocating, bats, and, that, of, the, moths, that, have, evolved, to, respond, to, the, sounds, that, the, bats, make, evolutionary, psychologists, claim, that, perception, demonstrates, the, principle, of, modularity, with, specialized, mechanisms, handling, particular, perception, tasks, for, example, people, with, damage, to, a, particular, part, of, the, brain, are, not, able, to, recognize, faces, prosopagnosia, evolutionary, psychology, suggests, that, this, indicates, a, so, called, face, reading, module, the, theory, of, closed, loop, perception, proposes, dynamic, motor, sensory, closed, loop, process, in, which, information, flows, through, the, environment, and, the, brain, in, continuous, loops, closed, loop, perception, appears, consistent, with, anatomy, and, with, the, fact, that, perception, is, typically, an, incremental, process, repeated, encounters, with, an, object, whether, conscious, or, not, enable, an, animal, to, refine, its, impressions, of, that, object, this, can, be, achieved, more, easily, with, a, circular, closed, loop, system, than, with, a, linear, open, loop, one, closed, loop, perception, can, explain, many, of, the, phenomena, that, open, loop, perception, struggles, to, account, for, this, is, largely, because, closed, loop, perception, considers, motion, to, be, an, integral, part, of, perception, and, not, an, interfering, component, that, must, be, corrected, for, furthermore, an, environment, perceived, via, sensor, motion, and, not, despite, sensor, motion, need, not, be, further, stabilized, by, internal, processes, anne, treisman, s, feature, integration, theory, fit, attempts, to, explain, how, characteristics, of, a, stimulus, such, as, physical, location, in, space, motion, color, and, shape, are, merged, to, form, one, percept, despite, each, of, these, characteristics, activating, separate, areas, of, the, cortex, fit, explains, this, through, a, two, part, system, of, perception, involving, the, preattentive, and, focused, attention, stages, the, preattentive, stage, of, perception, is, largely, unconscious, and, analyzes, an, object, by, breaking, it, down, into, its, basic, features, such, as, the, specific, color, geometric, shape, motion, depth, individual, lines, and, many, others, studies, have, shown, that, when, small, groups, of, objects, with, different, features, e, g, red, triangle, blue, circle, are, briefly, flashed, in, front, of, human, participants, many, individuals, later, report, seeing, shapes, made, up, of, the, combined, features, of, two, different, stimuli, thereby, referred, to, as, illusory, conjunctions, the, unconnected, features, described, in, the, preattentive, stage, are, combined, into, the, objects, one, normally, sees, during, the, focused, attention, stage, the, focused, attention, stage, is, based, heavily, around, the, idea, of, attention, in, perception, and, binds, the, features, together, onto, specific, objects, at, specific, spatial, locations, see, the, binding, problem, a, fundamentally, different, approach, to, understanding, the, perception, of, objects, relies, upon, the, essential, role, of, shared, intentionality, cognitive, psychologist, professor, michael, tomasello, hypothesized, that, social, bonds, between, children, and, caregivers, would, gradually, increase, through, the, essential, motive, force, of, shared, intentionality, beginning, from, birth, the, notion, of, shared, intentionality, introduced, by, michael, tomasello, was, developed, by, later, researchers, who, tended, to, explain, this, collaborative, interaction, from, different, perspectives, e, g, psychophysiology, and, neurobiology, the, shared, intentionality, approach, considers, perception, occurrence, at, an, earlier, stage, of, organisms, development, than, other, theories, even, before, the, emergence, of, intentionality, because, many, theories, build, their, knowledge, about, perception, based, on, its, main, features, of, the, organization, identification, and, interpretation, of, sensory, information, to, represent, the, holistic, picture, of, the, environment, intentionality, is, the, central, issue, in, perception, development, nowadays, only, one, hypothesis, attempts, to, explain, shared, intentionality, in, all, its, integral, complexity, from, the, level, of, interpersonal, dynamics, to, interaction, at, the, neuronal, level, introduced, by, latvian, professor, igor, val, danilov, the, hypothesis, of, neurobiological, processes, occurring, during, shared, intentionality, highlights, that, at, the, beginning, of, cognition, very, young, organisms, cannot, distinguish, relevant, sensory, stimuli, independently, because, the, environment, is, the, cacophony, of, stimuli, electromagnetic, waves, chemical, interactions, and, pressure, fluctuations, their, sensation, is, too, limited, by, the, noise, to, solve, the, cue, problem, the, relevant, stimulus, cannot, overcome, the, noise, magnitude, if, it, passes, through, the, senses, therefore, intentionality, is, a, difficult, problem, for, them, since, it, needs, the, representation, of, the, environment, already, categorized, into, objects, see, also, binding, problem, the, perception, of, objects, is, also, problematic, since, it, cannot, appear, without, intentionality, from, the, perspective, of, this, hypothesis, shared, intentionality, is, collaborative, interactions, in, which, participants, share, the, essential, sensory, stimulus, of, the, actual, cognitive, problem, this, social, bond, enables, ecological, training, of, the, young, immature, organism, starting, at, the, reflexes, stage, of, development, for, processing, the, organization, identification, and, interpretation, of, sensory, information, in, developing, perception, from, this, account, perception, emerges, due, to, shared, intentionality, in, the, embryonic, stage, of, development, i, e, even, before, birth, with, experience, organisms, can, learn, to, make, finer, perceptual, distinctions, and, learn, new, kinds, of, categorization, wine, tasting, the, reading, of, x, ray, images, and, music, appreciation, are, applications, of, this, process, in, the, human, sphere, research, has, focused, on, the, relation, of, this, to, other, kinds, of, learning, and, whether, it, takes, place, in, peripheral, sensory, systems, or, in, the, brain, s, processing, of, sense, information, empirical, research, show, that, specific, practices, such, as, yoga, mindfulness, tai, chi, meditation, daoshi, and, other, mind, body, disciplines, can, modify, human, perceptual, modality, specifically, these, practices, enable, perception, skills, to, switch, from, the, external, exteroceptive, field, towards, a, higher, ability, to, focus, on, internal, signals, proprioception, also, when, asked, to, provide, verticality, judgments, highly, self, transcendent, yoga, practitioners, were, significantly, less, influenced, by, a, misleading, visual, context, increasing, self, transcendence, may, enable, yoga, practitioners, to, optimize, verticality, judgment, tasks, by, relying, more, on, internal, vestibular, and, proprioceptive, signals, coming, from, their, own, body, rather, than, on, exteroceptive, visual, cues, past, actions, and, events, that, transpire, right, before, an, encounter, or, any, form, of, stimulation, have, a, strong, degree, of, influence, on, how, sensory, stimuli, are, processed, and, perceived, on, a, basic, level, the, information, our, senses, receive, is, often, ambiguous, and, incomplete, however, they, are, grouped, together, in, order, for, us, to, be, able, to, understand, the, physical, world, around, us, but, it, is, these, various, forms, of, stimulation, combined, with, our, previous, knowledge, and, experience, that, allows, us, to, create, our, overall, perception, for, example, when, engaging, in, conversation, we, attempt, to, understand, their, message, and, words, by, not, only, paying, attention, to, what, we, hear, through, our, ears, but, also, from, the, previous, shapes, we, have, seen, our, mouths, make, another, example, would, be, if, we, had, a, similar, topic, come, up, in, another, conversation, we, would, use, our, previous, knowledge, to, guess, the, direction, the, conversation, is, headed, in, a, perceptual, set, also, called, perceptual, expectancy, or, simply, set, is, a, predisposition, to, perceive, things, in, a, certain, way, it, is, an, example, of, how, perception, can, be, shaped, by, top, down, processes, such, as, drives, and, expectations, perceptual, sets, occur, in, all, the, different, senses, they, can, be, long, term, such, as, a, special, sensitivity, to, hearing, one, s, own, name, in, a, crowded, room, or, short, term, as, in, the, ease, with, which, hungry, people, notice, the, smell, of, food, a, simple, demonstration, of, the, effect, involved, very, brief, presentations, of, non, words, such, as, sael, subjects, who, were, told, to, expect, words, about, animals, read, it, as, seal, but, others, who, were, expecting, boat, related, words, read, it, as, sail, sets, can, be, created, by, motivation, and, so, can, result, in, people, interpreting, ambiguous, figures, so, that, they, see, what, they, want, to, see, for, instance, how, someone, perceives, what, unfolds, during, a, sports, game, can, be, biased, if, they, strongly, support, one, of, the, teams, in, one, experiment, students, were, allocated, to, pleasant, or, unpleasant, tasks, by, a, computer, they, were, told, that, either, a, number, or, a, letter, would, flash, on, the, screen, to, say, whether, they, were, going, to, taste, an, orange, juice, drink, or, an, unpleasant, tasting, health, drink, in, fact, an, ambiguous, figure, was, flashed, on, screen, which, could, either, be, read, as, the, letter, b, or, the, number, 13, when, the, letters, were, associated, with, the, pleasant, task, subjects, were, more, likely, to, perceive, a, letter, b, and, when, letters, were, associated, with, the, unpleasant, task, they, tended, to, perceive, a, number, 13, perceptual, set, has, been, demonstrated, in, many, social, contexts, when, someone, has, a, reputation, for, being, funny, an, audience, is, more, likely, to, find, them, amusing, individual, s, perceptual, sets, reflect, their, own, personality, traits, for, example, people, with, an, aggressive, personality, are, quicker, to, correctly, identify, aggressive, words, or, situations, in, general, perceptual, speed, as, a, mental, ability, is, positively, correlated, with, personality, traits, such, as, conscientiousness, emotional, stability, and, agreeableness, suggesting, its, evolutionary, role, in, preserving, homeostasis, one, classic, psychological, experiment, showed, slower, reaction, times, and, less, accurate, answers, when, a, deck, of, playing, cards, reversed, the, color, of, the, suit, symbol, for, some, cards, e, g, red, spades, and, black, hearts, philosopher, andy, clark, explains, that, perception, although, it, occurs, quickly, is, not, simply, a, bottom, up, process, where, minute, details, are, put, together, to, form, larger, wholes, instead, our, brains, use, what, he, calls, predictive, coding, it, starts, with, very, broad, constraints, and, expectations, for, the, state, of, the, world, and, as, expectations, are, met, it, makes, more, detailed, predictions, errors, lead, to, new, predictions, or, learning, processes, clark, says, this, research, has, various, implications, not, only, can, there, be, no, completely, unbiased, unfiltered, perception, but, this, means, that, there, is, a, great, deal, of, feedback, between, perception, and, expectation, perceptual, experiences, often, shape, our, beliefs, but, those, perceptions, were, based, on, existing, beliefs, indeed, predictive, coding, provides, an, account, where, this, type, of, feedback, assists, in, stabilizing, our, inference, making, process, about, the, physical, world, such, as, with, perceptual, constancy, examples, embodied, cognition, challenges, the, idea, of, perception, as, internal, representations, resulting, from, a, passive, reception, of, incomplete, sensory, inputs, coming, from, the, outside, world, according, to, o, regan, 1992, the, major, issue, with, this, perspective, is, that, it, leaves, the, subjective, character, of, perception, unexplained, thus, perception, is, understood, as, an, active, process, conducted, by, perceiving, and, engaged, agents, perceivers, furthermore, perception, is, influenced, by, agents, motives, and, expectations, their, bodily, states, and, the, interaction, between, the, agent, s, body, and, the, environment, around, it, perception, is, an, important, part, of, the, theories, of, many, philosophers, it, has, been, famously, addressed, by, rene, descartes, george, berkeley, and, immanuel, kant, to, name, a, few, in, his, work, the, meditations, descartes, begins, by, doubting, all, of, his, perceptions, proving, his, existence, with, the, famous, phrase, i, think, therefore, i, am, and, then, works, to, the, conclusion, that, perceptions, are, god, given, george, berkely, took, the, stance, that, all, things, that, we, see, have, a, reality, to, them, and, that, our, perceptions, were, sufficient, to, know, and, understand, that, thing, because, our, perceptions, are, capable, of, responding, to, a, true, reality, kant, almost, meets, the, rationalists, and, the, empiricists, half, way, his, theory, utilizes, the, reality, of, a, noumenon, the, actual, objects, that, cannot, be, understood, and, then, a, phenomenon, which, is, human, understanding, through, the, mind, lens, interpreting, that, noumenon
