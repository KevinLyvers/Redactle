international, law, also, known, as, public, international, law, and, the, law, of, nations, is, the, set, of, rules, norms, and, standards, that, states, and, other, actors, feel, an, obligation, to, obey, in, their, mutual, relations, and, generally, do, obey, in, international, relations, actors, are, simply, the, individuals, and, collective, entities, such, as, states, international, organizations, and, non, state, groups, which, can, make, behavioral, choices, whether, lawful, or, unlawful, rules, are, formal, often, written, expectations, for, behavior, and, norms, are, less, formal, customary, expectations, about, appropriate, behavior, that, are, frequently, unwritten, it, establishes, norms, for, states, across, a, broad, range, of, domains, including, war, and, diplomacy, economic, relations, and, human, rights, international, law, differs, from, state, based, domestic, legal, systems, in, that, it, operates, largely, through, consent, since, there, is, no, universally, accepted, authority, to, enforce, it, upon, sovereign, states, states, and, non, state, actors, may, choose, to, not, abide, by, international, law, and, even, to, breach, a, treaty, but, such, violations, particularly, of, peremptory, norms, can, be, met, with, disapproval, by, others, and, in, some, cases, coercive, action, ranging, from, diplomatic, and, economic, sanctions, to, war, the, sources, of, international, law, include, international, custom, general, state, practice, accepted, as, law, treaties, and, general, principles, of, law, recognised, by, most, national, legal, systems, although, international, law, may, also, be, reflected, in, international, comity, the, practices, adopted, by, states, to, maintain, good, relations, and, mutual, recognition, such, traditions, are, not, legally, binding, the, relationship, and, interaction, between, a, national, legal, system, and, international, law, is, complex, and, variable, national, law, may, become, international, law, when, treaties, permit, national, jurisdiction, to, supranational, tribunals, such, as, the, european, court, of, human, rights, or, the, international, criminal, court, treaties, such, as, the, geneva, conventions, require, national, law, to, conform, to, treaty, provisions, national, laws, or, constitutions, may, also, provide, for, the, implementation, or, integration, of, international, legal, obligations, into, domestic, law, the, modern, term, international, law, was, originally, coined, by, jeremy, bentham, in, his, 1789, book, introduction, to, the, principles, of, morals, and, legislation, to, replace, the, older, law, of, nations, a, direct, translation, of, the, late, medieval, concepts, of, ius, gentium, used, by, hugo, grotius, and, droits, des, gens, used, by, emer, de, vattel, the, definition, of, international, law, has, been, debated, bentham, referred, specifically, to, relationships, between, states, which, has, been, criticised, for, its, narrow, scope, lassa, oppenheim, defined, it, in, his, treatise, as, a, law, between, sovereign, and, equal, states, based, on, the, common, consent, of, these, states, and, this, definition, has, been, largely, adopted, by, international, legal, scholars, there, is, a, distinction, between, public, and, private, international, law, the, latter, is, concerned, with, whether, national, courts, can, claim, jurisdiction, over, cases, with, a, foreign, element, and, the, application, of, foreign, judgments, in, domestic, law, whereas, public, international, law, covers, rules, with, an, international, origin, the, difference, between, the, two, areas, of, law, has, been, debated, as, scholars, disagree, about, the, nature, of, their, relationship, joseph, story, who, originated, the, term, private, international, law, emphasised, that, it, must, be, governed, by, the, principles, of, public, international, law, but, other, academics, view, them, as, separate, bodies, of, law, another, term, transnational, law, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, a, body, of, both, national, and, international, rules, that, transcend, the, nation, state, although, some, academics, emphasise, that, it, is, distinct, from, either, type, of, law, it, was, defined, by, philip, jessup, as, all, law, which, regulates, actions, or, events, that, transcend, national, frontiers, a, more, recent, concept, is, supranational, law, which, was, described, in, a, 1969, paper, as, relatively, new, word, in, the, vocabulary, of, politics, systems, of, supranational, law, arise, when, nations, explicitly, cede, their, right, to, make, decisions, to, this, system, s, judiciary, and, legislature, which, then, have, the, right, to, make, laws, that, are, directly, effective, in, each, member, state, this, has, been, described, as, a, level, of, international, integration, beyond, mere, intergovernmentalism, yet, still, short, of, a, federal, system, the, most, common, example, of, a, supranational, system, is, the, european, union, the, origins, of, international, law, can, be, traced, back, to, antiquity, with, origins, tracing, back, to, antiquity, states, have, a, long, history, of, negotiating, interstate, agreements, an, initial, framework, was, conceptualised, by, the, ancient, romans, and, this, idea, of, ius, gentium, has, been, used, by, various, academics, to, establish, the, modern, concept, of, international, law, among, the, earliest, recorded, examples, are, peace, treaties, between, the, mesopotamian, city, states, of, lagash, and, umma, approximately, 3100, bce, and, an, agreement, between, the, egyptian, pharaoh, ramesses, ii, and, the, hittite, king, attu, ili, iii, concluded, in, 1279, bce, interstate, pacts, and, agreements, were, negotiated, and, agreed, upon, by, polities, across, the, world, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, to, east, asia, in, ancient, greece, many, early, peace, treaties, were, negotiated, between, its, city, states, and, occasionally, with, neighbouring, states, the, roman, empire, established, an, early, conceptual, framework, for, international, law, jus, gentium, which, governed, the, status, of, foreigners, living, in, rome, and, relations, between, foreigners, and, roman, citizens, adopting, the, greek, concept, of, natural, law, the, romans, conceived, of, jus, gentium, as, being, universal, however, in, contrast, to, modern, international, law, the, roman, law, of, nations, applied, to, relations, with, and, between, foreign, individuals, rather, than, among, political, units, such, as, states, beginning, with, the, spring, and, autumn, period, of, the, eighth, century, bce, china, was, divided, into, numerous, states, that, were, often, at, war, with, each, other, rules, for, diplomacy, and, treaty, making, emerged, including, notions, regarding, just, grounds, for, war, the, rights, of, neutral, parties, and, the, consolidation, and, partition, of, states, these, concepts, were, sometimes, applied, to, relations, with, barbarians, along, china, s, western, periphery, beyond, the, central, plains, the, subsequent, warring, states, period, saw, the, development, of, two, major, schools, of, thought, confucianism, and, legalism, both, of, which, held, that, the, domestic, and, international, legal, spheres, were, closely, interlinked, and, sought, to, establish, competing, normative, principles, to, guide, foreign, relations, similarly, the, indian, subcontinent, was, divided, into, various, states, which, over, time, developed, rules, of, neutrality, treaty, law, and, international, conduct, and, established, both, temporary, and, permanent, embassies, following, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, the, fifth, century, ce, europe, fragmented, into, numerous, often, warring, states, for, much, of, the, next, five, centuries, political, power, was, dispersed, across, a, range, of, entities, including, the, church, mercantile, city, states, and, kingdoms, most, of, which, had, overlapping, and, ever, changing, jurisdictions, as, in, china, and, india, these, divisions, prompted, the, development, of, rules, aimed, at, providing, stable, and, predictable, relations, early, examples, include, canon, law, which, governed, ecclesiastical, institutions, and, clergy, throughout, europe, the, lex, mercatoria, merchant, law, which, concerned, trade, and, commerce, and, various, codes, of, maritime, law, such, as, the, rolls, of, ol, ron, aimed, at, regulating, shipping, in, north, western, europe, and, the, later, laws, of, wisby, enacted, among, the, commercial, hanseatic, league, of, northern, europe, and, the, baltic, region, in, the, islamic, world, muhammad, al, shaybani, published, al, siyar, al, kab, r, in, the, eighth, century, which, served, as, a, fundamental, reference, work, for, siyar, a, subset, of, sharia, law, which, governed, foreign, relations, this, was, based, on, the, division, of, the, world, into, three, categories, the, dar, al, islam, where, islamic, law, prevailed, the, dar, al, sulh, non, islamic, realms, that, concluded, an, armistice, with, a, muslim, government, and, the, dar, al, harb, non, islamic, lands, which, were, contested, through, jihad, islamic, legal, principles, concerning, military, conduct, served, as, precursors, to, modern, international, humanitarian, law, and, institutionalised, limitations, on, military, conduct, including, guidelines, for, commencing, war, distinguishing, between, civilians, and, combatants, and, caring, for, the, sick, and, wounded, during, the, european, middle, ages, international, law, was, concerned, primarily, with, the, purpose, and, legitimacy, of, war, seeking, to, determine, what, constituted, just, war, the, greco, roman, concept, of, natural, law, was, combined, with, religious, principles, by, jewish, philosopher, maimonides, 1135, 1204, and, christian, theologian, thomas, aquinas, 1225, 1274, to, create, the, new, discipline, of, the, law, of, nations, which, unlike, its, eponymous, roman, predecessor, applied, natural, law, to, relations, between, states, in, islam, a, similar, framework, was, developed, wherein, the, law, of, nations, was, derived, in, part, from, the, principles, and, rules, set, forth, in, treaties, with, non, muslims, the, 15th, century, witnessed, a, confluence, of, factors, that, contributed, to, an, accelerated, development, of, international, law, italian, jurist, bartolus, de, saxoferrato, 1313, 1357, was, considered, the, founder, of, private, international, law, another, italian, jurist, baldus, de, ubaldis, 1327, 1400, provided, commentaries, and, compilations, of, roman, ecclesiastical, and, feudal, law, creating, an, organised, source, of, law, that, could, be, referenced, by, different, nations, alberico, gentili, 1552, 1608, took, a, secular, view, to, international, law, authoring, various, books, on, issues, in, international, law, notably, law, of, war, which, provided, comprehensive, commentary, on, the, laws, of, war, and, treaties, francisco, de, vitoria, 1486, 1546, who, was, concerned, with, the, treatment, of, indigenous, peoples, by, spain, invoked, the, law, of, nations, as, a, basis, for, their, innate, dignity, and, rights, articulating, an, early, version, of, sovereign, equality, between, peoples, francisco, su, rez, 1548, 1617, emphasised, that, international, law, was, founded, upon, natural, law, and, human, positive, law, dutch, jurist, hugo, grotius, 1583, 1645, is, widely, regarded, as, the, father, of, international, law, being, one, of, the, first, scholars, to, articulate, an, international, order, that, consists, of, a, society, of, states, governed, not, by, force, or, warfare, but, by, actual, laws, mutual, agreements, and, customs, grotius, secularised, international, law, his, 1625, work, de, jure, belli, ac, pacis, laid, down, a, system, of, principles, of, natural, law, that, bind, all, nations, regardless, of, local, custom, or, law, he, inspired, two, nascent, schools, of, international, law, the, naturalists, and, the, positivists, in, the, former, camp, was, german, jurist, samuel, von, pufendorf, 1632, 1694, who, stressed, the, supremacy, of, the, law, of, nature, over, states, his, 1672, work, of, the, law, of, nature, and, nations, expanded, on, the, theories, of, grotius, and, grounded, natural, law, to, reason, and, the, secular, world, asserting, that, it, regulated, only, external, acts, of, states, pufendorf, challenged, the, hobbesian, notion, that, the, state, of, nature, was, one, of, war, and, conflict, arguing, that, the, natural, state, of, the, world, is, actually, peaceful, but, weak, and, uncertain, without, adherence, to, the, law, of, nations, the, actions, of, a, state, consist, of, nothing, more, than, the, sum, of, the, individuals, within, that, state, thereby, requiring, the, state, to, apply, a, fundamental, law, of, reason, which, is, the, basis, of, natural, law, he, was, among, the, earliest, scholars, to, expand, international, law, beyond, european, christian, nations, advocating, for, its, application, and, recognition, among, all, peoples, on, the, basis, of, shared, humanity, in, contrast, positivist, writers, such, as, richard, zouche, 1590, 1661, in, england, and, cornelis, van, bynkershoek, 1673, 1743, in, the, netherlands, argued, that, international, law, should, derive, from, the, actual, practice, of, states, rather, than, christian, or, greco, roman, sources, the, study, of, international, law, shifted, away, from, its, core, concern, on, the, law, of, war, and, towards, the, domains, such, as, the, law, of, the, sea, and, commercial, treaties, the, positivist, school, grew, more, popular, as, it, reflected, accepted, views, of, state, sovereignty, and, was, consistent, with, the, empiricist, approach, to, philosophy, that, was, then, gaining, acceptance, in, europe, the, developments, of, the, 17th, century, culminated, at, the, conclusion, of, the, peace, of, westphalia, in, 1648, which, is, considered, the, seminal, event, in, international, law, the, resulting, westphalian, sovereignty, is, said, to, have, established, the, current, international, legal, order, characterised, by, independent, nation, states, which, have, equal, sovereignty, regardless, of, their, size, and, power, defined, primarily, by, non, interference, in, the, domestic, affairs, of, sovereign, states, although, historians, have, challenged, this, narrative, the, idea, of, nationalism, further, solidified, the, concept, and, formation, of, nation, states, elements, of, the, naturalist, and, positivist, schools, were, synthesised, notably, by, german, philosopher, christian, wolff, 1679, 1754, and, swiss, jurist, emer, de, vattel, 1714, 1767, both, of, whom, sought, a, middle, ground, approach, during, the, 18th, century, the, positivist, tradition, gained, broader, acceptance, although, the, concept, of, natural, rights, remained, influential, in, international, politics, particularly, through, the, republican, revolutions, of, the, united, states, and, france, until, the, mid, 19th, century, relations, between, states, were, dictated, mostly, by, treaties, agreements, between, states, to, behave, in, a, certain, way, unenforceable, except, by, force, and, nonbinding, except, as, matters, of, honour, and, faithfulness, one, of, the, first, instruments, of, modern, armed, conflict, law, was, the, lieber, code, of, 1863, which, governed, the, conduct, of, warfare, during, the, american, civil, war, and, is, noted, for, codifying, rules, and, articles, of, war, adhered, to, by, nations, across, the, world, including, the, united, kingdom, prussia, serbia, and, argentina, in, the, years, that, followed, numerous, other, treaties, and, bodies, were, created, to, regulate, the, conduct, of, states, towards, one, another, including, the, permanent, court, of, arbitration, in, 1899, and, the, hague, and, geneva, conventions, the, first, of, which, was, passed, in, 1864, colonial, expansion, by, european, powers, reached, its, peak, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, its, influence, began, to, wane, following, the, unprecedented, bloodshed, of, world, war, i, which, spurred, the, creation, of, international, organisations, right, of, conquest, was, generally, recognized, as, international, law, before, world, war, ii, the, league, of, nations, was, founded, to, safeguard, peace, and, security, international, law, began, to, incorporate, notions, such, as, self, determination, and, human, rights, the, united, nations, un, was, established, in, 1945, to, replace, the, league, with, an, aim, of, maintaining, collective, security, a, more, robust, international, legal, order, followed, buttressed, by, institutions, such, as, the, international, court, of, justice, icj, and, the, un, security, council, unsc, the, international, law, commission, ilc, was, established, in, 1947, to, develop, and, codify, international, law, in, the, 1940s, through, the, 1970s, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, bloc, and, decolonisation, across, the, world, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, scores, of, newly, independent, states, as, these, former, colonies, became, their, own, states, they, adopted, european, views, of, international, law, a, flurry, of, institutions, ranging, from, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, and, the, international, bank, for, reconstruction, and, development, world, bank, to, the, world, health, organization, furthered, the, development, of, a, multilateralist, approach, as, states, chose, to, compromise, on, sovereignty, to, benefit, from, international, cooperation, since, the, 1980s, there, has, been, an, increasing, focus, on, the, phenomenon, of, globalisation, and, on, protecting, human, rights, on, the, global, scale, particularly, when, minorities, or, indigenous, communities, are, involved, as, concerns, are, raised, that, globalisation, may, be, increasing, inequality, in, the, international, legal, system, the, sources, of, international, law, applied, by, the, community, of, nations, are, listed, in, article, 38, 1, of, the, statute, of, the, international, court, of, justice, which, is, considered, authoritative, in, this, regard, these, categories, are, in, order, international, treaties, customary, international, law, general, legal, principles, and, judicial, decisions, and, the, teachings, of, prominent, legal, scholars, as, a, subsidiary, means, for, the, determination, of, rules, of, law, it, was, originally, considered, that, the, arrangement, of, the, sources, sequentially, would, suggest, an, implicit, hierarchy, of, sources, however, the, statute, does, not, provide, for, a, hierarchy, and, other, academics, have, argued, that, therefore, the, sources, must, be, equivalent, general, principles, of, law, have, been, defined, in, the, statute, as, general, principles, of, law, recognized, by, civilized, nations, but, there, is, no, academic, consensus, about, what, is, included, within, this, scope, they, are, considered, to, be, derived, from, both, national, and, international, legal, systems, although, including, the, latter, category, has, led, to, debate, about, potential, cross, over, with, international, customary, law, the, relationship, of, general, principles, to, treaties, or, custom, has, generally, been, considered, to, be, fill, the, gaps, although, there, is, still, no, conclusion, about, their, exact, relationship, in, the, absence, of, a, hierarchy, a, treaty, is, defined, in, article, 2, of, the, vienna, convention, on, the, law, of, treaties, vclt, as, an, international, agreement, concluded, between, states, in, written, form, and, governed, by, international, law, whether, embodied, in, a, single, instrument, or, in, two, or, more, related, instruments, and, whatever, its, particular, designation, the, definition, specifies, that, the, parties, must, be, states, however, international, organisations, are, also, considered, to, have, the, capacity, to, enter, treaties, treaties, are, binding, through, the, principle, of, pacta, sunt, servanda, which, allows, states, to, create, legal, obligations, on, themselves, through, consent, the, treaty, must, be, governed, by, international, law, however, it, will, likely, be, interpreted, by, national, courts, the, vclt, which, codifies, several, bedrock, principles, of, treaty, interpretation, holds, that, a, treaty, shall, be, interpreted, in, good, faith, in, accordance, with, the, ordinary, meaning, to, be, given, to, the, terms, of, the, treaty, in, their, context, and, in, the, light, of, its, object, and, purpose, this, represents, a, compromise, between, three, theories, of, interpretation, the, textual, approach, which, looks, to, the, ordinary, meaning, of, the, text, the, subjective, approach, which, considers, factors, such, as, the, drafters, intention, and, the, teleological, approach, which, interprets, a, treaty, according, to, its, objective, and, purpose, a, state, must, express, its, consent, to, be, bound, by, a, treaty, through, signature, exchange, of, instruments, ratification, acceptance, approval, or, accession, accession, refers, to, a, state, choosing, to, become, party, to, a, treaty, that, it, is, unable, to, sign, such, as, when, establishing, a, regional, body, where, a, treaty, states, that, it, will, be, enacted, through, ratification, acceptance, or, approval, the, parties, must, sign, to, indicate, acceptance, of, the, wording, but, there, is, no, requirement, on, a, state, to, later, ratify, the, treaty, although, they, may, still, be, subject, to, certain, obligations, when, signing, or, ratifying, a, treaty, a, state, can, make, a, unilateral, statement, to, negate, or, amend, certain, legal, provisions, which, can, have, one, of, three, effects, the, reserving, state, is, bound, by, the, treaty, but, the, effects, of, the, relevant, provisions, are, precluded, or, changes, the, reserving, state, is, bound, by, the, treaty, but, not, the, relevant, provisions, or, the, reserving, state, is, not, bound, by, the, treaty, an, interpretive, declaration, is, a, separate, process, where, a, state, issues, a, unilateral, statement, to, specify, or, clarify, a, treaty, provision, this, can, affect, the, interpretation, of, the, treaty, but, it, is, generally, not, legally, binding, a, state, is, also, able, to, issue, a, conditional, declaration, stating, that, it, will, consent, to, a, given, treaty, only, on, the, condition, of, a, particular, provision, or, interpretation, article, 54, of, the, vclt, provides, that, either, party, may, terminate, or, withdraw, from, a, treaty, in, accordance, with, its, terms, or, at, any, time, with, the, consent, of, the, other, party, with, termination, applying, to, a, bilateral, treaty, and, withdrawal, applying, to, a, multilateral, treaty, where, a, treaty, does, not, have, provisions, allowing, for, termination, or, withdrawal, such, as, the, genocide, convention, it, is, prohibited, unless, the, right, was, implied, into, the, treaty, or, the, parties, had, intended, to, allow, for, it, a, treaty, can, also, be, held, invalid, including, where, parties, act, ultra, vires, or, negligently, where, execution, has, been, obtained, through, fraudulent, corrupt, or, forceful, means, or, where, the, treaty, contradicts, peremptory, norms, customary, international, law, requires, two, elements, a, consistent, practice, of, states, and, the, conviction, of, those, states, that, the, consistent, practice, is, required, by, a, legal, obligation, referred, to, as, opinio, juris, custom, distinguishes, itself, from, treaty, law, as, it, is, binding, on, all, states, regardless, of, whether, they, have, participated, in, the, practice, with, the, exception, of, states, who, have, been, persistent, objectors, during, the, process, of, the, custom, being, formed, and, special, or, local, forms, of, customary, law, the, requirement, for, state, practice, relates, to, the, practice, either, through, action, or, failure, to, act, of, states, in, relation, to, other, states, or, international, organisations, there, is, no, legal, requirement, for, state, practice, to, be, uniform, or, for, the, practice, to, be, long, running, although, the, icj, has, set, a, high, bar, for, enforcement, in, the, cases, of, anglo, norwegian, fisheries, and, north, sea, continental, shelf, there, has, been, legal, debate, on, this, topic, with, the, only, prominent, view, on, the, length, of, time, necessary, to, establish, custom, explained, by, humphrey, waldock, as, varying, according, to, the, nature, of, the, case, the, practice, is, not, required, to, be, followed, universally, by, states, but, there, must, be, a, general, recognition, by, states, whose, interests, are, specially, affected, the, second, element, of, the, test, opinio, juris, the, belief, of, a, party, that, a, particular, action, is, required, by, the, law, is, referred, to, as, the, subjective, element, the, icj, has, stated, in, dictum, in, north, sea, continental, shelf, that, not, only, must, the, acts, concerned, amount, to, a, settled, practice, but, they, must, also, be, such, or, be, carried, out, in, such, a, way, as, to, be, evidence, of, a, belief, that, this, practice, is, rendered, obligatory, by, the, existence, of, a, rule, of, law, requiring, it, a, committee, of, the, international, law, association, has, argued, that, there, is, a, general, presumption, of, an, opinio, juris, where, state, practice, is, proven, but, it, may, be, necessary, if, the, practice, suggests, that, the, states, did, not, believe, it, was, creating, a, precedent, the, test, in, these, circumstances, is, whether, opinio, juris, can, be, proven, by, the, states, failure, to, protest, other, academics, believe, that, intention, to, create, customary, law, can, be, shown, by, states, including, the, principle, in, multiple, bilateral, and, multilateral, treaties, so, that, treaty, law, is, necessary, to, form, customs, the, adoption, of, the, vclt, in, 1969, established, the, concept, of, jus, cogens, or, peremptory, norms, which, are, a, norm, accepted, and, recognized, by, the, international, community, of, states, as, a, whole, as, a, norm, from, which, no, derogation, is, permitted, and, which, can, be, modified, only, by, a, subsequent, norm, of, general, international, law, having, the, same, character, where, customary, or, treaty, law, conflicts, with, a, peremptory, norm, it, will, be, considered, invalid, but, there, is, no, agreed, definition, of, jus, cogens, academics, have, debated, what, principles, are, considered, peremptory, norms, but, the, mostly, widely, agreed, is, the, principle, of, non, use, of, force, the, next, year, the, icj, defined, erga, omnes, obligations, as, those, owed, to, the, international, community, as, a, whole, which, included, the, illegality, of, genocide, and, human, rights, there, are, generally, two, approaches, to, the, relationship, between, international, and, national, law, namely, monism, and, dualism, monism, assumes, that, international, and, national, law, are, part, of, the, same, legal, order, therefore, a, treaty, can, directly, become, part, of, national, law, without, the, need, for, enacting, legislation, although, they, will, generally, need, to, be, approved, by, the, legislature, once, approved, the, content, of, the, treaty, is, considered, as, a, law, that, has, a, higher, status, than, national, laws, examples, of, countries, with, a, monism, approach, are, france, and, the, netherlands, the, dualism, approach, considers, that, national, and, international, law, are, two, separate, legal, orders, so, treaties, are, not, granted, a, special, status, the, rules, in, a, treaty, can, only, be, considered, national, law, if, the, contents, of, the, treaty, have, been, enacted, first, an, example, is, the, united, kingdom, after, the, country, ratified, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, the, convention, was, only, considered, to, have, the, force, of, law, in, national, law, after, parliament, passed, the, human, rights, act, 1998, in, practice, the, division, of, countries, between, monism, and, dualism, is, often, more, complicated, countries, following, both, approaches, may, accept, peremptory, norms, as, being, automatically, binding, and, they, may, approach, treaties, particularly, later, amendments, or, clarifications, differently, than, they, would, approach, customary, law, many, countries, with, older, or, unwritten, constitutions, do, not, have, explicit, provision, for, international, law, in, their, domestic, system, and, there, has, been, an, upswing, in, support, for, monism, principles, in, relation, to, human, rights, and, humanitarian, law, as, most, principles, governing, these, concepts, can, be, found, in, international, law, a, state, is, defined, under, article, 1, of, the, montevideo, convention, on, the, rights, and, duties, of, states, as, a, legal, person, with, a, permanent, population, a, defined, territory, government, and, capacity, to, enter, relations, with, other, states, there, is, no, requirement, on, population, size, allowing, micro, states, such, as, san, marino, and, monaco, to, be, admitted, to, the, un, and, no, requirement, of, fully, defined, boundaries, allowing, israel, to, be, admitted, despite, border, disputes, there, was, originally, an, intention, that, a, state, must, have, self, determination, but, now, the, requirement, is, for, a, stable, political, environment, the, final, requirement, of, being, able, to, enter, relations, is, commonly, evidenced, by, independence, and, sovereignty, under, the, principle, of, par, in, parem, non, habet, imperium, all, states, are, sovereign, and, equal, but, state, recognition, often, plays, a, significant, role, in, political, conceptions, a, country, may, recognise, another, nation, as, a, state, and, separately, it, may, recognise, that, nation, s, government, as, being, legitimate, and, capable, of, representing, the, state, on, the, international, stage, there, are, two, theories, on, recognition, the, declaratory, theory, sees, recognition, as, commenting, on, a, current, state, of, law, which, has, been, separately, satisfied, whereas, the, constitutive, theory, states, that, recognition, by, other, states, determines, whether, a, state, can, be, considered, to, have, legal, personality, states, can, be, recognised, explicitly, through, a, released, statement, or, tacitly, through, conducting, official, relations, although, some, countries, have, formally, interacted, without, conferring, recognition, throughout, the, 19th, century, and, the, majority, of, the, 20th, century, states, were, protected, by, absolute, immunity, so, they, could, not, face, criminal, prosecution, for, any, actions, however, a, number, of, countries, began, to, distinguish, between, acta, jure, gestionis, commercial, actions, and, acta, jure, imperii, government, actions, the, restrictive, theory, of, immunity, said, states, were, immune, where, they, were, acting, in, a, governmental, capacity, but, not, a, commercial, one, the, european, convention, on, state, immunity, in, 1972, and, the, un, convention, on, jurisdictional, immunities, of, states, and, their, property, attempt, to, restrict, immunity, in, accordance, with, customary, law, historically, individuals, have, not, been, seen, as, entities, in, international, law, as, the, focus, was, on, the, relationship, between, states, as, human, rights, have, become, more, important, on, the, global, stage, being, codified, by, the, un, general, assembly, unga, in, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, 1948, individuals, have, been, given, the, power, to, defend, their, rights, to, judicial, bodies, international, law, is, largely, silent, on, the, issue, of, nationality, law, with, the, exception, of, cases, of, dual, nationality, or, where, someone, is, claiming, rights, under, refugee, law, but, as, argued, by, the, political, theorist, hannah, arendt, human, rights, are, often, tied, to, someone, s, nationality, the, european, court, of, human, rights, allows, individuals, to, petition, the, court, where, their, rights, have, been, violated, and, national, courts, have, not, intervened, and, the, inter, american, court, of, human, rights, and, the, african, court, on, human, and, peoples, rights, have, similar, powers, traditionally, sovereign, states, and, the, holy, see, were, the, sole, subjects, of, international, law, with, the, proliferation, of, international, organisations, over, the, last, century, they, have, also, been, recognised, as, relevant, parties, one, definition, of, international, organisations, comes, from, the, ilc, s, 2011, draft, articles, on, the, responsibility, of, international, organizations, which, in, article, 2, a, states, that, it, is, an, organization, established, by, treaty, or, other, instrument, governed, by, international, law, and, possessing, its, own, international, legal, personality, this, definition, functions, as, a, starting, point, but, does, not, recognise, that, organisations, can, have, no, separate, personality, but, nevertheless, function, as, an, international, organisation, the, un, economic, and, social, council, has, emphasised, a, split, between, inter, government, organisations, igos, which, are, created, by, inter, governmental, agreements, and, international, non, governmental, organisations, ingos, all, international, organisations, have, members, generally, this, is, restricted, to, states, although, it, can, include, other, international, organisations, sometimes, non, members, will, be, allowed, to, participate, in, meetings, as, observers, the, yearbook, of, international, organizations, sets, out, a, list, of, international, organisations, which, include, the, un, the, wto, the, world, bank, and, the, imf, generally, organisations, consist, of, a, plenary, organ, where, member, states, can, be, represented, and, heard, an, executive, organ, to, decide, matters, within, the, competence, of, the, organisation, and, an, administrative, organ, to, execute, the, decisions, of, the, other, organs, and, handle, secretarial, duties, international, organisations, will, typically, provide, for, their, privileges, and, immunity, in, relation, to, its, member, states, in, their, constitutional, documents, or, in, multilateral, agreements, such, as, the, convention, on, the, privileges, and, immunities, of, the, united, nations, these, organisations, also, have, the, power, to, enter, treaties, using, the, vienna, convention, on, the, law, of, treaties, between, states, and, international, organizations, or, between, international, organizations, as, a, basis, although, it, is, not, yet, in, force, they, may, also, have, the, right, to, bring, legal, claims, against, states, depending, as, set, out, in, reparation, for, injuries, where, they, have, legal, personality, and, the, right, to, do, so, in, their, constitution, the, unsc, has, the, power, under, chapter, vii, of, the, un, charter, to, take, decisive, and, binding, actions, against, states, committing, a, threat, to, the, peace, breach, of, the, peace, or, an, act, of, aggression, for, collective, security, although, prior, to, 1990, it, has, only, intervened, once, in, the, case, of, korea, in, 1950, this, power, can, only, be, exercised, however, where, a, majority, of, member, states, vote, for, it, as, well, as, receiving, the, support, of, the, permanent, five, members, of, the, unsc, this, can, be, followed, up, with, economic, sanctions, military, action, and, similar, uses, of, force, the, unsc, also, has, a, wide, discretion, under, article, 24, which, grants, primary, responsibility, for, issues, of, international, peace, and, security, the, unga, concerned, during, the, cold, war, with, the, requirement, that, the, ussr, would, have, to, authorise, any, unsc, action, adopted, the, uniting, for, peace, resolution, of, 3, november, 1950, which, allowed, the, organ, to, pass, recommendations, to, authorize, the, use, of, force, this, resolution, also, led, to, the, practice, of, un, peacekeeping, which, has, been, notably, been, used, in, east, timor, and, kosovo, there, are, more, than, one, hundred, international, courts, in, the, global, community, although, states, have, generally, been, reluctant, to, allow, their, sovereignty, to, be, limited, in, this, way, the, first, known, international, court, was, the, central, american, court, of, justice, prior, to, world, war, i, when, the, permanent, court, of, international, justice, pcij, was, established, the, pcij, was, replaced, by, the, icj, which, is, the, best, known, international, court, due, to, its, universal, scope, in, relation, to, geographical, jurisdiction, and, subject, matter, there, are, additionally, a, number, of, regional, courts, including, the, court, of, justice, of, the, european, union, the, efta, court, and, the, court, of, justice, of, the, andean, community, interstate, arbitration, can, also, be, used, to, resolve, disputes, between, states, leading, in, 1899, to, the, creation, of, the, permanent, court, of, arbitration, which, facilitates, the, process, by, maintaining, a, list, of, arbitrators, this, process, was, used, in, the, island, of, palmas, case, and, to, resolve, disputes, during, the, eritrean, ethiopian, war, the, icj, operates, as, one, of, the, six, organs, of, the, un, based, out, of, the, hague, with, a, panel, of, fifteen, permanent, judges, it, has, jurisdiction, to, hear, cases, involving, states, but, cannot, get, involved, in, disputes, involving, individuals, or, international, organizations, the, states, that, can, bring, cases, must, be, party, to, the, statute, of, the, icj, although, in, practice, most, states, are, un, members, and, would, therefore, be, eligible, the, court, has, jurisdiction, over, all, cases, that, are, referred, to, it, and, all, matters, specifically, referred, to, in, the, un, charter, or, international, treaties, although, in, practice, there, are, no, relevant, matters, in, the, un, charter, the, icj, may, also, be, asked, by, an, international, organisation, to, provide, an, advisory, opinion, on, a, legal, question, which, are, generally, considered, non, binding, but, authoritative, conflict, of, laws, also, known, as, private, international, law, was, originally, concerned, with, choice, of, law, determining, which, nation, s, laws, should, govern, a, particular, legal, circumstance, historically, the, comity, theory, has, been, used, although, the, definition, is, unclear, sometimes, referring, to, reciprocity, and, sometimes, being, used, as, a, synonym, for, private, international, law, story, distinguished, it, from, any, absolute, paramount, obligation, superseding, all, discretion, on, the, subject, there, are, three, aspects, to, conflict, of, laws, determining, which, domestic, court, has, jurisdiction, over, a, dispute, determining, if, a, domestic, court, has, jurisdiction, and, determining, whether, foreign, judgments, can, be, enforced, the, first, question, relates, to, whether, the, domestic, court, or, a, foreign, court, is, best, placed, to, decide, the, case, when, determining, the, national, law, that, should, apply, the, lex, causae, is, the, law, that, has, been, chosen, to, govern, the, case, which, is, generally, foreign, and, the, lexi, fori, is, the, national, law, of, the, court, making, the, determination, some, examples, are, lex, domicilii, the, law, of, the, domicile, and, les, patriae, the, law, of, the, nationality, the, rules, which, are, applied, to, conflict, of, laws, will, vary, depending, on, the, national, system, determining, the, question, there, have, been, attempts, to, codify, an, international, standard, to, unify, the, rules, so, differences, in, national, law, cannot, lead, to, inconsistencies, such, as, through, the, hague, convention, on, the, recognition, and, enforcement, of, foreign, judgments, in, civil, and, commercial, matters, and, the, brussels, regulations, these, treaties, codified, practice, on, the, enforcement, of, international, judgments, stating, that, a, foreign, judgment, would, be, automatically, recognised, and, enforceable, where, required, in, the, jurisdiction, where, the, party, resides, unless, the, judgement, was, contrary, to, public, order, or, conflicted, with, a, local, judgment, between, the, same, parties, on, a, global, level, the, new, york, convention, on, the, recognition, and, enforcement, of, foreign, arbitral, awards, was, introduced, in, 1958, to, internationalise, the, enforcement, of, arbitral, awards, although, it, does, not, have, jurisdiction, over, court, judgments, a, state, must, prove, that, it, has, jurisdiction, before, it, can, exercise, its, legal, authority, this, concept, can, be, divided, between, prescriptive, jurisdiction, which, is, the, authority, of, a, legislature, to, enact, legislation, on, a, particular, issue, and, adjudicative, jurisdiction, which, is, the, authority, of, a, court, to, hear, a, particular, case, this, aspect, of, private, international, law, should, first, be, resolved, by, reference, to, domestic, law, which, may, incorporate, international, treaties, or, other, supranational, legal, concepts, although, there, are, consistent, international, norms, there, are, five, forms, of, jurisdiction, which, are, consistently, recognised, in, international, law, an, individual, or, act, can, be, subject, to, multiple, forms, of, jurisdiction, the, first, is, the, territorial, principle, which, states, that, a, nation, has, jurisdiction, over, actions, which, occur, within, its, territorial, boundaries, the, second, is, the, nationality, principle, also, known, as, the, active, personality, principle, whereby, a, nation, has, jurisdiction, over, actions, committed, by, its, nationals, regardless, of, where, they, occur, the, third, is, the, passive, personality, principle, which, gives, a, country, jurisdiction, over, any, actions, which, harm, its, nationals, the, fourth, is, the, protective, principle, where, a, nation, has, jurisdiction, in, relation, to, threats, to, its, fundamental, national, interests, the, final, form, is, universal, jurisdiction, where, a, country, has, jurisdiction, over, certain, acts, based, on, the, nature, of, the, crime, itself, following, world, war, ii, the, modern, system, for, international, human, rights, was, developed, to, make, states, responsible, for, their, human, rights, violations, the, un, economic, and, security, council, established, the, un, commission, on, human, rights, in, 1946, which, developed, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, udhr, which, established, non, binding, international, human, rights, standards, for, work, standards, of, living, housing, and, education, non, discrimination, a, fair, trial, and, prohibition, of, torture, two, further, human, rights, treaties, were, adopted, by, the, un, in, 1966, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, iccpr, and, the, international, covenant, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, icescr, these, two, documents, along, with, the, udhr, are, considered, the, international, bill, of, human, rights, non, domestic, human, rights, enforcement, operates, at, both, the, international, and, regional, levels, established, in, 1993, the, office, of, the, un, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, supervises, charter, based, and, treaty, based, procedures, the, former, are, based, on, the, un, charter, and, operate, under, the, un, human, rights, council, where, each, global, region, is, represented, by, elected, member, states, the, council, is, responsible, for, universal, periodic, review, which, requires, each, un, member, state, to, review, its, human, rights, compliance, every, four, years, and, for, special, procedures, including, the, appointment, of, special, rapporteurs, independent, experts, and, working, groups, the, treaty, based, procedure, allows, individuals, to, rely, on, the, nine, primary, human, rights, treaties, the, regional, human, rights, enforcement, systems, operate, in, europe, africa, and, the, americas, through, the, european, court, of, human, rights, the, inter, american, court, of, human, rights, and, the, african, court, on, human, and, peoples, rights, international, human, rights, has, faced, criticism, for, its, western, focus, as, many, countries, were, subject, to, colonial, rule, at, the, time, that, the, udhr, was, drafted, although, many, countries, in, the, global, south, have, led, the, development, of, human, rights, on, the, global, stage, in, the, intervening, decades, international, labour, law, is, generally, defined, as, the, substantive, rules, of, law, established, at, the, international, level, and, the, procedural, rules, relating, to, their, adoption, and, implementation, it, operates, primarily, through, the, international, labor, organization, ilo, a, un, agency, with, the, mission, of, protecting, employment, rights, which, was, established, in, 1919, the, ilo, has, a, constitution, setting, out, a, number, of, aims, including, regulating, work, hours, and, labour, supply, protecting, workers, and, children, and, recognising, equal, pay, and, the, right, to, free, association, as, well, as, the, declaration, of, philadelphia, of, 1944, which, re, defined, the, purpose, of, the, ilo, the, 1998, declaration, on, fundamental, principles, and, rights, at, work, further, binds, ilo, member, states, to, recognise, fundamental, labour, rights, including, free, association, collective, bargaining, and, eliminating, forced, labour, child, labour, and, employment, discrimination, the, ilo, have, also, created, labour, standards, which, are, set, out, in, their, conventions, and, recommendations, member, states, then, have, the, choice, as, to, whether, or, not, to, ratify, and, implement, these, standards, the, secretariat, of, the, ilo, is, the, international, labour, office, which, can, be, consulted, by, states, to, determine, the, meaning, of, a, convention, which, forms, the, ilo, s, case, law, although, the, right, to, organise, convention, does, not, provide, an, explicit, right, to, strike, this, has, been, interpreted, into, the, treaty, through, case, law, the, un, does, not, specifically, focus, on, international, labour, law, although, some, of, its, treaties, cover, the, same, topics, many, of, the, primary, human, rights, conventions, also, form, part, of, international, labour, law, providing, protection, in, employment, and, against, discrimination, on, the, grounds, of, gender, and, race, it, has, been, claimed, that, there, is, no, concept, of, discrete, international, environmental, law, with, the, general, principles, of, international, law, instead, being, applied, to, these, issues, since, the, 1960s, a, number, of, treaties, focused, on, environmental, protection, were, ratified, including, the, declaration, of, the, united, nations, conference, on, the, human, environment, of, 1972, the, world, charter, for, nature, of, 1982, and, the, vienna, convention, for, the, protection, of, the, ozone, layer, of, 1985, states, generally, agreed, to, co, operate, with, each, other, in, relation, to, environmental, law, as, codified, by, principle, 24, of, the, rio, declaration, of, 1972, despite, these, and, other, multilateral, environmental, agreements, covering, specific, issues, there, is, no, overarching, policy, on, international, environmental, protection, or, one, specific, international, organisation, with, the, exception, of, the, un, environmental, programme, instead, a, general, treaty, setting, out, the, framework, for, tackling, an, issue, has, then, been, supplemented, by, more, specific, protocols, climate, change, has, been, one, of, the, most, important, and, heavily, debated, topics, in, recent, environmental, law, the, united, nations, framework, convention, on, climate, change, intended, to, set, out, a, framework, for, the, mitigation, of, greenhouse, gases, and, responses, to, resulting, environmental, changes, was, introduced, in, 1992, and, came, into, force, two, years, later, as, of, 2023, 198, states, were, a, party, separate, protocols, have, been, introduced, through, conferences, of, the, parties, including, the, kyoto, protocol, which, was, introduced, in, 1997, to, set, specific, targets, for, greenhouse, gas, reduction, and, the, 2015, paris, agreement, which, set, the, goal, of, keeping, global, warming, at, least, below, 2, c, 3, 6, f, above, pre, industrial, levels, individuals, and, organisations, have, some, rights, under, international, environmental, law, as, the, aarhus, convention, in, 1998, set, obligations, on, states, to, provide, information, and, allow, public, input, on, these, issues, however, few, disputes, under, the, regimes, set, out, in, environmental, agreements, are, referred, to, the, icj, as, the, agreements, tend, to, specify, their, compliance, procedures, these, procedures, generally, focus, on, encouraging, the, state, to, once, again, become, compliant, through, recommendations, but, there, is, still, uncertainty, on, how, these, procedures, should, operate, and, efforts, have, been, made, to, regulate, these, processes, although, some, worry, that, this, will, undercut, the, efficiency, of, the, procedures, themselves, legal, territory, can, be, divided, into, four, categories, there, is, territorial, sovereignty, which, covers, land, and, territorial, sea, including, the, airspace, above, it, and, the, subsoil, below, it, territory, outside, the, sovereignty, of, any, state, res, nullius, which, is, not, yet, within, territorial, sovereignty, but, is, territory, that, is, legally, capable, of, being, acquired, by, a, state, and, res, communis, which, is, territory, that, cannot, be, acquired, by, a, state, there, have, historically, been, five, methods, of, acquiring, territorial, sovereignty, reflecting, roman, property, law, occupation, accretion, cession, conquest, and, prescription, the, law, of, the, sea, is, the, area, of, international, law, concerning, the, principles, and, rules, by, which, states, and, other, entities, interact, in, maritime, matters, it, encompasses, areas, and, issues, such, as, navigational, rights, sea, mineral, rights, and, coastal, waters, jurisdiction, the, law, of, the, sea, was, primarily, composed, of, customary, law, until, the, 20th, century, beginning, with, the, league, of, nations, codification, conference, in, 1930, the, un, conference, on, the, law, of, the, sea, and, the, adoption, of, the, unclos, in, 1982, the, unclos, was, particularly, notable, for, making, international, courts, and, tribunals, responsible, for, the, law, of, the, sea, the, boundaries, of, a, nation, s, territorial, sea, were, initially, proposed, to, be, three, miles, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, unclos, instead, defined, it, as, being, at, most, 12, nautical, miles, from, the, baseline, usually, the, coastal, low, water, mark, of, a, state, both, military, and, civilian, foreign, ships, are, allowed, innocent, passage, through, these, waters, despite, the, sea, being, within, the, state, s, sovereignty, a, state, can, have, jurisdiction, beyond, its, territorial, waters, where, it, claims, a, contiguous, zone, of, up, to, 24, nautical, miles, from, its, baseline, for, the, purpose, of, preventing, the, infringement, of, its, customs, fiscal, immigration, and, sanitary, regulations, states, are, also, able, to, claim, an, exclusive, economic, zone, eez, following, passage, of, the, unclos, which, can, stretch, up, to, 200, nautical, miles, from, the, baseline, and, gives, the, sovereign, state, rights, over, natural, resources, some, states, have, instead, chosen, to, retain, their, exclusive, fishery, zones, which, cover, the, same, territory, there, are, specific, rules, in, relation, to, the, continental, shelf, as, this, can, extend, further, than, 200, nautical, miles, the, international, tribunal, for, the, law, of, the, sea, has, specified, that, a, state, has, sovereign, rights, over, the, resources, of, the, entire, continental, shelf, regardless, of, its, distance, from, the, baseline, but, different, rights, apply, to, the, continental, shelf, and, the, water, column, above, it, where, it, is, further, than, 200, nautical, miles, from, the, coast, the, unclos, defines, the, high, seas, as, all, parts, of, the, sea, that, are, not, within, a, state, s, eez, territorial, sea, or, internal, waters, there, are, six, freedoms, of, the, high, seas, navigation, overflight, laying, submarine, cables, and, pipelines, constructing, artificial, islands, fishing, and, scientific, research, some, of, which, are, subject, to, legal, restrictions, ships, in, the, high, seas, are, deemed, to, have, the, nationality, of, the, flag, that, they, have, the, right, to, fly, and, no, other, state, can, exercise, jurisdiction, over, them, the, exception, is, ships, used, for, piracy, which, are, subject, to, universal, jurisdiction, in, 1944, the, bretton, woods, conference, established, the, international, bank, for, reconstruction, and, development, later, the, world, bank, and, the, imf, at, the, conference, the, international, trade, organization, was, proposed, but, failed, to, be, instituted, due, to, the, refusal, of, the, united, states, to, ratify, its, charter, three, years, later, part, iv, of, the, statute, was, adopted, to, create, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, which, operated, between, 1948, and, 1994, when, the, wto, was, established, the, opec, which, banded, together, to, control, global, oil, supply, and, prices, caused, the, previous, reliance, on, fixed, currency, exchange, rates, to, be, dropped, in, favour, of, floating, exchange, rates, in, 1971, during, this, recession, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, and, us, president, ronald, reagan, pushed, for, free, trade, and, deregulation, under, a, neo, liberal, agenda, known, as, the, washington, consensus, the, law, relating, to, the, initiation, of, armed, conflict, is, jus, ad, bellum, this, was, codified, in, 1928, in, the, kellogg, briand, pact, which, stated, that, conflicts, should, be, settled, through, peaceful, negotiations, with, the, exception, through, reservations, drafted, by, some, state, parties, of, self, defence, these, fundamental, principles, were, re, affirmed, in, the, un, charter, which, provided, for, an, almost, absolute, prohibition, on, the, use, of, force, with, the, only, three, exceptions, the, first, involves, force, authorised, by, the, unsc, as, the, entity, is, responsible, in, the, first, instance, for, responding, to, breaches, or, threats, to, the, peace, and, acts, of, aggression, including, the, use, of, force, or, peacekeeping, missions, the, second, exception, is, where, a, state, is, acting, in, individual, or, collective, self, defence, a, state, is, allowed, to, act, in, self, defence, in, the, case, of, an, armed, attack, but, the, intention, behind, this, exception, has, been, challenged, particularly, as, nuclear, weapons, have, become, more, common, with, many, states, relying, instead, on, the, customary, right, of, self, defence, as, set, out, in, the, caroline, test, the, icj, considered, collective, self, defence, in, nicaragua, v, united, states, where, the, u, s, unsuccessfully, argued, that, it, had, mined, harbours, in, nicaragua, in, pre, emption, of, an, attack, by, the, sandinista, government, against, another, member, of, the, organization, of, american, states, the, final, exception, is, where, the, unsc, delegates, its, responsibility, for, collective, security, to, a, regional, organisation, such, as, nato, on, humanitarian, grounds, the, use, of, landmines, ottawa, treaty, and, cluster, munitions, ccm, is, prohibited, under, international, law, international, humanitarian, law, ihl, is, an, effort, to, mitigate, the, human, suffering, caused, by, war, and, it, is, often, complementary, to, the, law, of, armed, conflict, and, international, human, rights, law, the, concept, of, jus, in, bello, law, in, war, covers, ihl, which, is, distinct, from, jus, ad, bellum, its, scope, lasts, from, the, initiation, of, conflict, until, a, peaceful, settlement, is, reached, there, are, two, main, principles, in, ihl, the, principle, of, distinction, dictates, that, combatants, and, non, combatants, must, be, treated, differently, and, the, principle, of, not, causing, disproportionate, suffering, to, combatants, in, legality, of, the, threat, or, use, of, nuclear, weapons, the, icj, described, these, concepts, as, intransgressible, principles, of, international, customary, law, the, two, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, considered, restrictions, on, the, conduct, of, war, and, the, geneva, conventions, of, 1949, which, were, organised, by, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, considered, the, protection, of, innocent, parties, in, conflict, zones, the, first, geneva, convention, covers, wounded, and, ill, combatants, the, second, geneva, convention, covers, combatants, at, sea, who, are, wounded, ill, or, shipwrecked, the, third, geneva, convention, covers, prisoners, of, war, and, the, fourth, geneva, convention, covers, civilians, these, conventions, were, supplemented, the, additional, protocol, i, and, protocol, ii, which, were, codified, in, 1977, initially, ihl, conventions, were, only, considered, to, apply, to, a, conflict, if, all, parties, had, ratified, the, relevant, convention, under, the, si, omnes, clause, but, this, posed, concerns, and, the, martens, clause, began, to, be, implemented, providing, that, the, law, would, generally, be, deemed, to, apply, there, have, been, various, agreements, to, outlaw, particular, types, of, weapons, such, as, the, chemical, weapons, convention, and, the, biological, weapons, convention, the, use, of, nuclear, weapons, was, determined, to, be, in, conflict, with, principles, of, ihl, by, the, icj, in, 1995, although, the, court, also, held, that, it, cannot, conclude, definitively, whether, the, threat, or, use, of, nuclear, weapons, would, be, lawful, or, unlawful, in, an, extreme, circumstance, of, self, defence, multiple, treaties, have, attempted, to, regulate, the, use, of, these, weapons, including, the, non, proliferation, treaty, and, the, joint, comprehensive, plan, of, action, but, key, states, have, failed, to, sign, or, have, withdrawn, there, have, been, similar, debates, on, the, use, of, drones, and, cyberwarefare, on, the, international, stage, international, criminal, law, sets, out, the, definition, of, international, crimes, and, compels, states, to, prosecute, these, crimes, while, war, crimes, were, prosecuted, throughout, history, this, has, historically, been, done, by, national, courts, the, international, military, tribunal, in, nuremberg, and, the, international, military, tribunal, for, the, far, east, in, tokyo, were, established, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, to, prosecute, key, actors, in, germany, and, japan, the, jurisdiction, of, the, tribunals, was, limited, to, crimes, against, peace, based, on, the, kellogg, briand, pact, war, crimes, based, on, the, hague, conventions, and, crimes, against, humanity, establishing, new, categories, of, international, crime, throughout, the, twentieth, century, the, separate, crimes, of, genocide, torture, and, terrorism, were, also, recognised, initially, these, crimes, were, intended, to, be, prosecuted, by, national, courts, and, subject, to, their, domestic, procedures, the, geneva, conventions, of, 1949, the, additional, protocols, of, 1977, and, the, 1984, un, convention, against, torture, mandated, that, the, national, courts, of, the, contracting, countries, must, prosecute, these, offenses, where, the, perpetrator, is, on, their, territory, or, extradite, them, to, any, other, interested, state, it, was, in, the, 1990s, that, two, ad, hoc, tribunals, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, icty, and, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, rwanda, ictr, were, established, by, the, unsc, to, address, specific, atrocities, the, icty, had, authority, to, prosecute, war, crimes, crimes, against, humanity, and, genocide, occurring, in, yugoslavia, after, 1991, and, the, ictr, had, authority, to, prosecute, genocide, crimes, against, humanity, and, grave, breaches, of, the, 1949, geneva, conventions, during, the, 1994, rwandan, genocide, the, international, criminal, court, icc, established, by, the, 1998, rome, statute, is, the, first, and, only, permanent, international, court, to, prosecute, genocide, war, crimes, crimes, against, humanity, and, the, crime, of, aggression, there, are, 123, state, parties, to, the, icc, although, a, number, of, states, have, declared, their, opposition, to, the, court, it, has, been, criticised, by, african, countries, including, the, gambia, and, kenya, for, imperialist, prosecutions, one, particular, aspect, of, the, court, that, has, received, scrutiny, is, the, principle, of, complementarity, whereby, the, icc, only, has, jurisdiction, if, the, national, courts, of, a, state, with, jurisdiction, are, unwilling, or, unable, to, prosecute, or, where, a, state, has, investigated, but, chosen, not, to, prosecute, a, case, the, united, states, has, a, particularly, complicated, relationship, with, the, icc, originally, signing, the, treaty, in, 2000, the, us, stated, in, 2002, that, it, did, not, intend, to, become, a, party, as, it, believed, the, icc, threatened, its, national, sovereignty, and, the, country, does, not, recognise, the, court, s, jurisdiction, hybrid, courts, are, the, most, recent, type, of, international, criminal, court, they, aim, to, combine, both, national, and, international, components, operating, in, the, jurisdiction, where, the, crimes, in, question, occurred, international, courts, have, been, criticised, for, a, lack, of, legitimacy, as, they, can, seem, disconnected, from, the, crimes, that, have, occurred, but, the, hybrid, courts, are, able, to, provide, the, resources, that, may, be, lacking, in, countries, facing, the, aftermath, of, serious, conflict, there, has, been, debate, about, what, courts, can, be, included, within, this, definition, but, generally, the, special, panels, for, serious, crimes, in, east, timor, the, kosovo, specialist, chambers, the, special, court, for, sierra, leone, the, special, tribunal, for, lebanon, and, the, extraordinary, chambers, in, the, courts, of, cambodia, have, been, listed, international, legal, theory, comprises, a, variety, of, theoretical, and, methodological, approaches, used, to, explain, and, analyse, the, content, formation, and, effectiveness, of, international, law, and, institutions, and, to, suggest, improvements, some, approaches, center, on, the, question, of, compliance, why, states, follow, international, norms, in, the, absence, of, a, coercive, power, that, ensures, compliance, some, scholars, view, compliance, failure, as, a, problem, of, enforcement, whereby, states, can, be, incentivized, to, follow, international, law, due, to, international, inducements, reciprocity, concerns, about, reputation, or, domestic, political, factors, other, scholars, see, compliance, failure, as, rooted, in, a, lack, of, state, capacity, where, a, willing, state, is, incapable, of, fully, following, international, legal, commitments, other, perspectives, are, policy, oriented, they, elaborate, theoretical, frameworks, and, instruments, to, criticize, the, existing, norms, and, to, make, suggestions, on, how, to, improve, them, some, of, these, approaches, are, based, on, domestic, legal, theory, some, are, interdisciplinary, and, others, have, been, developed, expressly, to, analyse, international, law, classical, approaches, to, international, legal, theory, are, the, natural, law, the, eclectic, and, the, legal, positivism, schools, of, thought, the, natural, law, approach, argues, that, international, norms, should, be, based, on, axiomatic, truths, the, 16th, century, natural, law, writer, de, vitoria, examined, the, questions, of, the, just, war, the, spanish, authority, in, the, americas, and, the, rights, of, the, native, american, peoples, in, 1625, grotius, argued, that, nations, as, well, as, persons, ought, to, be, governed, by, universal, principle, based, on, morality, and, divine, justice, while, the, relations, among, polities, ought, to, be, governed, by, the, law, of, peoples, the, jus, gentium, established, by, the, consent, of, the, community, of, nations, on, the, basis, of, the, principle, of, pacta, sunt, servanda, that, is, on, the, basis, of, the, observance, of, commitments, on, his, part, de, vattel, argued, instead, for, the, equality, of, states, as, articulated, by, 18th, century, natural, law, and, suggested, that, the, law, of, nations, was, composed, of, custom, and, law, on, the, one, hand, and, natural, law, on, the, other, during, the, 17th, century, the, basic, tenets, of, the, grotian, or, eclectic, school, especially, the, doctrines, of, legal, equality, territorial, sovereignty, and, independence, of, states, became, the, fundamental, principles, of, the, european, political, and, legal, system, and, were, enshrined, in, the, 1648, peace, of, westphalia, the, early, positivist, school, emphasized, the, importance, of, custom, and, treaties, as, sources, of, international, law, in, the, 16th, century, gentili, used, historical, examples, to, posit, that, positive, law, jus, voluntarium, was, determined, by, general, consent, van, bynkershoek, asserted, that, the, bases, of, international, law, were, customs, and, treaties, commonly, consented, to, by, various, states, while, john, jacob, moser, emphasized, the, importance, of, state, practice, in, international, law, the, positivism, school, narrowed, the, range, of, international, practice, that, might, qualify, as, law, favouring, rationality, over, morality, and, ethics, the, 1815, congress, of, vienna, marked, the, formal, recognition, of, the, political, and, international, legal, system, based, on, the, conditions, of, europe, modern, legal, positivists, consider, international, law, as, a, unified, system, of, rules, that, emanates, from, the, states, will, international, law, as, it, is, is, an, objective, reality, that, needs, to, be, distinguished, from, law, as, it, should, be, classic, positivism, demands, rigorous, tests, for, legal, validity, and, it, deems, irrelevant, all, extralegal, arguments, john, austin, asserted, that, due, to, the, principle, of, par, in, parem, non, habet, imperium, so, called, international, law, lacking, a, sovereign, power, and, so, unenforceable, was, not, really, law, at, all, but, positive, morality, consisting, of, opinions, and, sentiments, more, ethical, than, legal, in, nature, since, states, are, few, in, number, diverse, and, atypical, in, character, unindictable, lack, a, centralised, sovereign, power, and, their, agreements, unpoliced, and, decentralised, martin, wight, argued, that, international, society, is, better, described, as, anarchy, hans, morgenthau, believed, international, law, to, be, the, weakest, and, most, primitive, system, of, law, enforcement, he, likened, its, decentralised, nature, to, the, law, that, prevails, in, preliterate, tribal, societies, monopoly, on, violence, is, what, makes, domestic, law, enforceable, but, between, nations, there, are, multiple, competing, sources, of, force, the, confusion, created, by, treaty, laws, which, resemble, private, contracts, between, persons, is, mitigated, only, by, the, relatively, small, number, of, states, he, asserted, that, no, state, may, be, compelled, to, submit, a, dispute, to, an, international, tribunal, making, laws, unenforceable, and, voluntary, international, law, is, also, unpoliced, lacking, agencies, for, enforcement, he, cites, a, 1947, us, opinion, poll, in, which, 75, of, respondents, wanted, an, international, police, to, maintain, world, peace, but, only, 13, wanted, that, force, to, exceed, the, us, armed, forces, later, surveys, have, produced, similar, contradictory, results, international, law, is, currently, navigating, a, complex, array, of, challenges, and, controversies, that, have, underscored, the, dynamic, nature, of, international, relations, in, the, 21st, century, some, of, these, challenges, include, enforcement, difficulties, the, impact, of, technological, advancements, climate, change, and, worldwide, pandemics, the, possible, re, emergence, of, right, of, conquest, as, international, law, is, contentious, among, the, most, pressing, issues, are, enforcement, difficulties, where, the, lack, of, a, centralized, global, authority, often, leads, to, non, compliance, with, international, norms, particularly, evident, in, violations, of, international, humanitarian, law, ihl, sovereignty, disputes, further, complicate, the, international, legal, landscape, as, conflicts, over, territorial, claims, and, jurisdictional, boundaries, arise, challenging, the, principles, of, non, interference, and, peaceful, resolution, furthermore, the, emergence, of, new, global, powers, introduces, additional, layers, of, complexity, as, these, nations, assert, their, interests, and, challenge, established, norms, necessitating, a, reevaluation, of, the, global, legal, order, to, accommodate, shifting, power, dynamics, cybersecurity, has, also, emerged, as, a, critical, concern, with, international, law, striving, to, address, the, threats, posed, by, cyber, attacks, to, national, security, infrastructure, and, individual, privacy, climate, change, demands, unprecedented, international, cooperation, as, evidenced, by, agreements, like, the, paris, agreement, though, disparities, in, responsibilities, among, nations, pose, significant, challenges, to, collective, action, the, covid, 19, pandemic, has, further, highlighted, the, interconnectedness, of, the, global, community, emphasizing, the, need, for, coordinated, efforts, to, manage, health, crises, vaccine, distribution, and, economic, recovery, these, contemporary, issues, underscore, the, need, for, ongoing, adaptation, and, cooperation, within, the, framework, of, international, law, to, address, the, multifaceted, challenges, of, the, modern, world, ensuring, a, just, peaceful, and, sustainable, global, order
