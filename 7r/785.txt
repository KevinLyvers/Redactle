a, passive, entity, that, is, created, by, the, organization, public, does, not, necessarily, have, an, exchange, relationship, and, is, both, self, creating, and, self, organizing, publics, are,

transitory, and, homo, narrans, where, a, public, is, in, the, words, of, gabriel, m, vasquez, assistant, professor, in, the, school, of, communication, at, the, university, of, houston, a, collection, of, individuals, that, develop, a, group, consciousness, around, a, problematic, situation, and, act, to, solve, the, problematic, situations, vasquez, 1993, pp, 209, public, schools, are, often, under, controversy, for, their, agenda, building, especially, in, debates, over, whether, to, teach, a, religious, or, secular, curriculum, the, promotion, of, an, agenda, is, commonplace, whenever, one, is, in, a, public, environment, but, schools, have, exceptional, power, in, that, regard, one, non, situational, concept, of, a, public, is, that, of, kirk, hallahan, professor, at, colorado, state, university, who, defines, a, public, as, a, group, of, people, who, relate, to, an, organization, who, demonstrate, varying, degrees, of, activity, passivity, and, who, might, or, might, not, interact, with, others, concerning, their, relationship, with, the, organization, samuel, mateus, s, 2011, paper, public, as, social, experience, considered, to, view, the, concept, by, an, alternative, point, of, view, the, public, is, neither, a, simple, audience, constituted, by, media, consumers, nor, just, a, rational, critical, agency, of, a, public, sphere, he, argued, the, concept, should, also, be, seen, in, the, light, of, a, publicness, principle, beyond, a, critic, and, manipulative, publicity, in, accordance, the, public, may, be, regarded, as, the, result, of, the, social, activities, made, by, individuals, sharing, symbolic, representations, and, common, emotions, in, publicness, seen, with, lower, case, the, concept, is, a, set, of, subjectivities, who, look, publicly, for, a, feeling, of, belonging, so, in, this, perspective, the, public, is, still, a, fundamental, notion, to, social, life, although, in, a, different, manner, in, comparison, to,
