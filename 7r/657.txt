list, of, forms, of, government, a, federation, also, called, a, federal, state, is, an, entity, characterized, by, a, union, of, partially, self, governing, provinces, states, or, other, regions, under, a, federal, government, federalism, in, a, federation, the, self, governing, status, of, the, component, states, as, well, as, the, division, of, power, between, them, and, the, central, government, is, constitutionally, entrenched, and, may, not, be, altered, by, a, unilateral, decision, neither, by, the, component, states, nor, the, federal, political, body, without, constitutional, amendment, sovereign, power, is, formally, divided, between, a, central, authority, and, a, number, of, constituent, regions, so, that, each, region, retains, some, degree, of, control, over, its, internal, affairs, overriding, powers, of, a, central, authority, theoretically, can, include, the, constitutional, authority, to, suspend, a, constituent, state, s, government, by, invoking, gross, mismanagement, or, civil, unrest, or, to, adopt, national, legislation, that, overrides, or, infringes, on, the, constituent, states, powers, by, invoking, the, central, government, s, constitutional, authority, to, ensure, peace, and, good, government, or, to, implement, obligations, contracted, under, an, international, treaty, the, governmental, or, constitutional, structure, found, in, a, federation, is, considered, to, be, federalist, or, to, be, an, example, of, federalism, it, can, be, considered, the, opposite, of, another, system, the, unitary, state, france, and, japan, for, example, have, been, unitary, for, many, centuries, the, austrian, empire, was, a, unitary, state, with, crown, lands, after, the, transformation, into, the, austria, hungary, monarchy, the, remaining, crown, lands, of, so, called, cisleithania, became, federated, as, l, nder, of, the, republic, of, austria, through, the, implementation, of, its, constitution, germany, with, its, 16, states, or, l, nder, and, nigeria, with, its, 36, states, and, federal, capital, territory, are, examples, of, federations, federations, are, often, multi, ethnic, and, cover, a, large, area, of, territory, such, as, russia, the, united, states, canada, india, brazil, pakistan, or, australia, but, neither, is, necessarily, the, case, such, as, saint, kitts, and, nevis, or, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, several, ancient, chiefdoms, and, kingdoms, such, as, the, 4th, century, bce, league, of, corinth, noricum, in, central, europe, and, the, iroquois, confederacy, in, pre, columbian, north, america, could, be, described, as, federations, or, confederations, the, old, swiss, confederacy, was, an, early, example, of, formal, non, unitary, statehood, several, colonies, and, dominions, in, the, new, world, consisted, of, autonomous, provinces, transformed, into, federal, states, upon, independence, such, as, the, united, states, and, various, countries, in, latin, america, see, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, some, of, the, new, world, federations, failed, the, federal, republic, of, central, america, broke, up, into, independent, states, less, than, 20, years, after, its, founding, others, such, as, argentina, have, shifted, between, federal, confederal, and, unitary, systems, before, settling, into, federalism, brazil, became, a, federation, only, after, the, fall, of, the, monarchy, and, venezuela, became, a, federation, after, the, federal, war, australia, and, canada, are, also, federations, germany, is, another, nation, state, that, has, switched, between, confederal, federal, and, unitary, rules, since, the, german, confederation, was, founded, in, 1815, the, north, german, confederation, the, succeeding, german, empire, and, the, weimar, republic, were, federations, founded, in, 1922, the, soviet, union, was, formally, a, federation, of, soviet, republics, autonomous, republics, and, other, federal, subjects, though, in, practice, highly, centralized, under, the, government, of, the, soviet, union, the, russian, federation, has, inherited, a, similar, system, india, pakistan, nigeria, and, malaysia, then, federation, of, malaya, became, federations, on, or, shortly, before, becoming, independent, from, the, british, empire, in, some, recent, cases, federations, have, been, instituted, as, a, measure, to, handle, ethnic, conflict, within, a, state, such, as, bosnia, and, herzegovina, and, iraq, since, 2005, as, well, as, somalia, since, 2012, with, the, united, states, constitution, having, become, effective, on, 4, march, 1789, the, united, states, is, the, oldest, surviving, federation, while, the, newest, federation, is, nepal, after, its, constitution, went, into, effect, on, 20, september, 2015, the, component, states, are, in, some, sense, sovereign, insofar, as, certain, powers, are, reserved, to, them, that, may, not, be, exercised, by, the, central, government, however, a, federation, is, more, than, a, mere, loose, alliance, of, independent, states, the, component, states, of, a, federation, usually, possess, no, powers, in, relation, to, foreign, policy, and, so, enjoy, no, independent, status, under, international, law, however, german, l, nder, have, that, power, which, is, beginning, to, be, exercised, on, a, european, level, some, federations, are, called, asymmetric, because, some, states, have, more, autonomy, than, others, an, example, of, such, a, federation, is, malaysia, in, which, sarawak, and, sabah, agreed, to, form, the, federation, on, different, terms, and, conditions, from, the, states, of, peninsular, malaysia, a, federation, often, emerges, from, an, initial, agreement, between, several, separate, states, the, purpose, can, be, the, will, to, solve, mutual, problems, and, to, provide, for, mutual, defense, or, to, create, a, nation, state, for, an, ethnicity, spread, over, several, states, the, former, was, the, case, with, the, united, states, and, switzerland, however, as, the, histories, of, countries, and, nations, vary, the, federalist, system, of, a, state, can, be, quite, different, from, these, models, australia, for, instance, is, unique, in, that, it, came, into, existence, as, a, nation, by, the, democratic, vote, of, the, citizens, of, each, state, who, voted, yes, in, referendums, to, adopt, the, australian, constitution, brazil, on, the, other, hand, has, experienced, both, the, federal, and, the, unitary, state, during, its, history, some, present, day, states, of, the, brazilian, federation, retain, borders, set, during, the, portuguese, colonization, before, the, very, existence, of, the, brazilian, state, whereas, the, latest, state, tocantins, was, created, by, the, 1988, constitution, for, chiefly, administrative, reasons, seven, of, the, top, eight, largest, countries, by, area, are, governed, as, federations, a, unitary, state, is, sometimes, one, with, only, a, single, centralized, national, tier, of, government, however, unitary, states, often, also, include, one, or, more, self, governing, regions, the, difference, between, a, federation, and, this, kind, of, unitary, state, is, that, in, a, unitary, state, the, autonomous, status, of, self, governing, regions, exists, by, the, sufferance, of, the, central, government, and, may, be, unilaterally, revoked, while, it, is, common, for, a, federation, to, be, brought, into, being, by, agreement, between, a, number, of, formally, independent, states, in, a, unitary, state, self, governing, regions, are, often, created, through, a, process, of, devolution, where, a, formerly, centralized, state, agrees, to, grant, autonomy, to, a, region, that, was, previously, entirely, subordinate, thus, federations, are, often, established, voluntarily, from, below, whereas, devolution, grants, self, government, from, above, a, confederation, in, modern, political, terms, is, usually, limited, to, a, permanent, union, of, sovereign, states, for, common, action, in, relation, to, other, states, the, closest, entity, in, the, world, to, a, confederation, at, this, time, is, the, european, union, while, the, word, confederation, was, officially, used, when, the, canadian, federal, system, was, established, in, 1867, the, term, refers, only, to, the, process, and, not, the, resulting, state, since, canadian, provinces, are, not, sovereign, and, do, not, claim, to, be, in, the, case, of, switzerland, while, the, country, is, still, known, officially, as, the, swiss, confederation, this, is, now, a, misnomer, since, the, swiss, cantons, lost, their, sovereign, status, in, 1848, in, belgium, however, the, opposite, movement, is, underway, belgium, was, founded, as, a, centralized, state, after, the, french, model, but, has, gradually, been, reformed, into, a, federal, state, by, consecutive, constitutional, reforms, since, the, 1970s, moreover, although, nominally, called, a, federal, state, the, country, s, structure, already, has, a, number, of, confederational, traits, at, present, there, is, a, growing, movement, to, transform, the, existing, federal, state, into, a, looser, confederation, with, two, or, three, constitutive, states, and, or, two, special, regions, a, confederation, is, most, likely, to, feature, three, differences, when, contrasted, with, a, federation, 1, no, real, direct, powers, many, confederal, decisions, are, externalized, by, member, state, legislation, 2, decisions, on, day, to, day, matters, are, not, taken, by, simple, majority, but, by, special, majorities, or, even, by, consensus, or, unanimity, veto, for, every, member, 3, changes, of, the, constitution, usually, a, treaty, require, unanimity, over, time, these, terms, acquired, distinct, connotations, leading, to, the, present, difference, in, definition, an, example, of, this, is, the, united, states, under, the, articles, of, confederation, the, articles, established, a, national, government, under, what, today, would, be, defined, as, a, federal, system, albeit, with, a, comparatively, weaker, federal, government, however, canadians, designed, with, a, stronger, central, government, than, the, us, in, the, wake, of, the, civil, war, of, the, latter, use, the, term, confederation, to, refer, to, the, formation, or, joining, not, the, structure, of, canada, legal, reforms, court, rulings, and, political, compromises, have, decentralized, canada, in, practice, since, its, formation, in, 1867, an, empire, is, a, multi, ethnic, state, multinational, state, or, a, group, of, nations, with, a, central, government, established, usually, through, coercion, on, the, model, of, the, roman, empire, an, empire, often, includes, self, governing, regions, but, these, will, possess, autonomy, only, at, the, sufferance, of, the, central, government, on, the, other, hand, a, political, entity, that, is, an, empire, in, name, may, comprise, several, partly, autonomous, kingdoms, organised, together, in, a, federation, with, the, empire, being, ruled, over, by, an, emperor, or, senior, king, great, king, high, king, king, of, kings, one, example, of, this, was, the, german, empire, 1871, 1918, a, federacy, is, a, unitary, state, that, incorporates, one, or, more, self, governing, autonomous, areas, it, is, distinguished, from, a, federation, in, that, the, constitutional, structure, of, the, state, is, still, unitary, but, incorporates, federalist, principles, some, federacies, notably, land, were, established, through, international, treaty, a, federation, differs, from, a, devolved, state, such, as, indonesia, and, the, united, kingdom, because, in, a, devolved, state, the, central, government, can, revoke, the, independence, of, the, subunits, scottish, parliament, the, senedd, and, the, northern, ireland, assembly, in, the, case, of, the, united, kingdom, without, changing, the, constitution, in, some, cases, such, as, the, autonomous, communities, of, spain, devolution, has, led, to, federation, in, all, but, name, or, federation, without, federalism, the, relation, between, the, crown, dependencies, of, the, isle, of, man, and, the, bailiwicks, of, guernsey, and, jersey, in, the, channel, islands, and, the, united, kingdom, is, very, similar, to, a, federate, relation, the, islands, enjoy, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, which, via, the, crown, takes, care, of, their, foreign, relations, and, defense, although, the, uk, parliament, does, have, overall, power, to, legislate, for, the, dependencies, however, the, islands, are, neither, an, incorporated, part, of, the, united, kingdom, nor, are, they, considered, to, be, independent, or, associated, states, the, islands, do, not, have, a, monarch, per, se, rather, in, the, isle, of, man, the, british, monarch, is, ex, officio, lord, of, mann, and, in, the, bailiwicks, of, guernsey, and, jersey, the, british, monarch, rules, as, the, duke, of, normandy, dependent, territories, such, as, the, british, overseas, territories, are, vested, with, varying, degrees, of, power, some, enjoy, considerable, independence, from, the, sovereign, state, which, only, takes, care, of, their, foreign, relations, and, defense, however, they, are, neither, considered, to, be, part, of, it, nor, recognized, as, sovereign, or, associated, states, the, distinction, between, a, federation, and, a, unitary, state, is, often, quite, ambiguous, a, unitary, state, may, closely, resemble, a, federation, in, structure, and, while, a, central, government, may, possess, the, theoretical, right, to, revoke, the, autonomy, of, a, self, governing, region, it, may, be, politically, difficult, for, it, to, do, so, in, practice, the, self, governing, regions, of, some, unitary, states, also, often, enjoy, greater, autonomy, than, those, of, some, federations, for, these, reasons, it, is, sometimes, argued, that, some, modern, unitary, states, are, de, facto, federations, de, facto, federations, or, quasi, federations, are, often, termed, regional, states, spain, is, suggested, as, one, possible, de, facto, federation, as, it, grants, more, self, government, to, its, autonomous, communities, than, are, retained, by, the, constituent, entities, of, most, federations, for, the, spanish, parliament, to, revoke, the, autonomy, of, regions, such, as, galicia, catalonia, or, the, basque, country, would, be, a, political, near, impossibility, though, nothing, bars, it, legally, the, spanish, parliament, has, however, suspended, the, autonomy, of, catalonia, in, response, to, the, catalan, declaration, of, independence, in, the, lead, up, to, the, 2017, catalan, election, additionally, some, autonomies, such, as, navarre, or, the, basque, country, have, full, control, over, taxation, and, spending, transferring, a, payment, to, the, central, government, for, the, common, services, military, foreign, relations, macroeconomic, policy, for, example, scholar, enrique, guill, n, l, pez, discusses, the, federal, nature, of, spain, s, government, a, trend, that, almost, no, one, denies, each, autonomous, community, is, governed, by, a, statute, of, autonomy, estatuto, de, autonom, a, under, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1978, although, south, africa, bears, some, elements, of, a, federal, system, such, as, the, allocation, of, certain, powers, to, provinces, some, nevertheless, argue, that, it, is, functionally, a, unitary, state, on, the, other, hand, if, federation, is, defined, as, the, constitutional, entrenchment, of, the, powers, of, subcentral, units, provinces, etc, that, is, not, unilaterally, changeable, or, revocable, by, the, central, authority, south, africa, does, qualify, formally, as, a, federal, state, the, european, union, eu, is, a, sui, generis, political, union, or, confederation, the, assemblage, of, societies, or, an, association, of, two, or, more, states, into, one, state, robert, schuman, the, initiator, of, the, european, community, system, wrote, that, a, transnational, community, like, the, founding, of, the, european, coal, and, steel, community, lay, midway, between, an, association, of, states, where, they, retained, complete, independence, and, a, federation, leading, to, a, fusion, of, states, in, a, super, state, the, founding, fathers, of, the, european, union, wrote, the, europe, declaration, charter, of, the, community, at, the, time, of, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, paris, on, 18, april, 1951, saying, that, europe, should, be, organized, on, a, transnational, foundation, they, envisaged, a, structure, quite, different, from, a, federation, called, the, european, political, community, the, eu, is, a, three, pillar, structure, of, the, original, supranational, european, economic, community, and, the, nuclear, energy, cooperation, and, non, proliferation, treaty, euratom, plus, two, largely, intergovernmental, pillars, dealing, with, external, affairs, and, justice, and, home, affairs, the, eu, is, therefore, not, a, de, jure, federation, although, some, academic, observers, conclude, that, after, 50, years, of, institutional, evolution, since, the, treaties, of, rome, it, is, becoming, one, the, european, union, possesses, attributes, of, a, federal, state, however, its, central, government, is, far, weaker, than, that, of, most, federations, and, the, individual, members, are, sovereign, states, under, international, law, so, it, is, usually, characterized, as, an, unprecedented, form, of, supra, national, union, the, eu, has, responsibility, for, important, areas, such, as, trade, monetary, union, agriculture, and, fisheries, nonetheless, eu, member, states, retain, the, right, to, act, independently, in, matters, of, foreign, policy, and, defense, and, also, enjoy, a, near, monopoly, over, other, major, policy, areas, such, as, criminal, justice, and, taxation, since, the, treaty, of, lisbon, the, member, states, right, to, leave, the, union, is, codified, and, the, union, operates, with, more, qualified, majority, voting, rather, than, unanimity, in, many, areas, by, the, signature, of, this, treaty, the, participating, parties, give, proof, of, their, determination, to, create, the, first, supranational, institution, and, that, thus, they, are, laying, the, true, foundation, of, an, organized, europe, this, europe, remains, open, to, all, nations, we, profoundly, hope, that, other, nations, will, join, us, in, our, common, endeavor, europe, has, charted, its, own, brand, of, constitutional, federalism, those, uncomfortable, using, the, f, word, in, the, eu, context, should, feel, free, to, refer, to, it, as, a, quasi, federal, or, federal, like, system, nevertheless, for, the, purposes, of, the, analysis, here, the, eu, has, the, necessary, attributes, of, a, federal, system, it, is, striking, that, while, many, scholars, of, the, eu, continue, to, resist, analyzing, it, as, a, federation, most, contemporary, students, of, federalism, view, the, eu, as, a, federal, system, see, for, instance, bednar, filippov, et, al, mckay, kelemen, defigueido, and, weingast, a, more, nuanced, view, has, been, given, by, the, german, constitutional, court, here, the, eu, is, defined, as, an, association, of, sovereign, national, states, staatenverbund, with, this, view, the, european, union, resembles, more, of, a, confederation, constitutionally, the, power, vested, in, the, special, administrative, regions, of, the, people, s, republic, is, granted, from, the, central, people, s, government, through, a, decision, by, the, national, people, s, congress, however, there, have, been, certain, largely, informal, grants, of, power, to, the, provinces, to, handle, economic, affairs, and, implement, national, policies, resulting, in, a, system, some, have, termed, federalism, with, chinese, characteristics, constitutionally, a, unitary, state, the, political, system, in, myanmar, bears, many, elements, of, federalism, each, administrative, division, has, its, own, cabinets, and, chief, ministers, making, it, more, like, a, federation, rather, than, a, unitary, state, the, french, overseas, collectivity, wallis, and, futuna, maintains, some, quasi, federation, attributes, the, territory, is, divided, into, three, traditional, chiefdoms, uvea, sigave, and, alo, the, chiefdoms, are, allowed, to, have, their, own, legal, system, which, have, to, be, implemented, along, with, french, legal, system, under, the, terms, of, the, fomboni, accords, signed, in, december, 2001, by, the, leaders, of, all, three, islands, the, official, name, of, the, country, was, changed, to, the, union, of, the, comoros, the, new, state, was, to, be, highly, decentralised, and, the, central, union, government, would, devolve, most, powers, to, the, new, island, governments, each, led, by, a, president, certain, forms, of, political, and, constitutional, dispute, are, common, to, federations, one, issue, is, that, the, exact, division, of, power, and, responsibility, between, federal, and, regional, governments, is, often, a, source, of, controversy, often, as, is, the, case, with, the, united, states, such, conflicts, are, resolved, through, the, judicial, system, which, delimits, the, powers, of, federal, and, local, governments, the, relationship, between, federal, and, local, courts, varies, from, nation, to, nation, and, can, be, a, controversial, and, complex, issue, in, itself, another, common, issue, in, federal, systems, is, the, conflict, between, regional, and, national, interests, or, between, the, interests, and, aspirations, of, different, ethnic, groups, in, some, federations, the, entire, jurisdiction, is, relatively, homogeneous, and, each, constituent, state, resembles, a, miniature, version, of, the, whole, this, is, known, as, congruent, federalism, on, the, other, hand, incongruent, federalism, exists, where, different, states, or, regions, possess, distinct, ethnic, groups, the, ability, of, a, federal, government, to, create, national, institutions, that, can, mediate, differences, that, arise, because, of, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or, other, regional, differences, is, an, important, challenge, the, inability, to, meet, this, challenge, may, lead, to, the, secession, of, parts, of, a, federation, or, to, civil, war, as, occurred, in, the, united, states, southern, states, sought, to, protect, the, institution, of, slavery, while, northern, states, opposed, it, with, a, catalysis, occurring, in, the, then, kansas, territory, in, nigeria, and, in, switzerland, in, the, case, of, malaysia, singapore, was, expelled, from, the, federation, because, of, rising, racial, tension, in, some, cases, internal, conflict, may, lead, a, federation, to, collapse, entirely, as, occurred, the, federation, of, rhodesia, and, nyasaland, the, gran, colombia, the, united, provinces, of, central, america, and, the, west, indies, federation, the, federal, government, is, the, common, government, of, a, national, or, supranational, federation, a, federal, government, may, have, distinct, powers, at, various, levels, authorized, or, delegated, to, it, by, its, member, states, the, structure, of, federal, governments, varies, based, on, a, broad, definition, of, a, basic, federalism, there, are, two, or, more, levels, of, government, that, exist, within, an, established, territory, and, govern, through, common, institutions, with, overlapping, or, shared, powers, as, prescribed, by, a, constitution, the, federal, government, is, the, government, at, the, level, of, the, sovereign, state, usual, responsibilities, of, this, level, of, government, are, maintaining, national, security, and, exercising, international, diplomacy, including, the, right, to, sign, binding, treaties, basically, a, modern, federal, government, within, the, limits, defined, by, its, constitution, has, the, power, to, make, laws, for, the, whole, country, unlike, local, governments, as, originally, written, the, united, states, constitution, was, created, to, limit, the, federal, government, from, exerting, power, over, the, states, by, enumerating, only, specific, powers, it, was, further, limited, by, the, addition, of, the, tenth, amendment, contained, in, the, bill, of, rights, and, the, eleventh, amendment, however, later, amendments, particularly, the, fourteenth, amendment, gave, the, federal, government, considerable, authority, over, states, federal, government, within, this, structure, are, the, government, ministries, and, departments, and, agencies, to, which, the, ministers, of, government, are, assigned, there, are, 26, federations, in, the, world, with, 6, each, in, asia, and, europe, 5, in, africa, 4, in, north, america, 3, in, south, america, and, 2, in, oceania, some, of, the, proclaimed, arab, federations, were, confederations, de, facto
