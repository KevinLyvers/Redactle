humanistic, psychology, is, a, psychological, perspective, that, arose, in, the, mid, 20th, century, in, answer, to, two, theories, sigmund, freud, s, psychoanalytic, theory, and, b, f, skinner, s, behaviorism, thus, abraham, maslow, established, the, need, for, a, third, force, in, psychology, the, school, of, thought, of, humanistic, psychology, gained, traction, due, to, maslow, in, the, 1950s, some, elements, of, humanistic, psychology, are, humanistic, psychology, also, acknowledges, spiritual, aspiration, as, an, integral, part, of, the, psyche, it, is, linked, to, the, emerging, field, of, transpersonal, psychology, primarily, humanistic, therapy, encourages, a, self, awareness, and, reflexivity, that, helps, the, client, change, their, state, of, mind, and, behavior, from, one, set, of, reactions, to, a, healthier, one, with, more, productive, and, thoughtful, actions, essentially, this, approach, allows, the, merging, of, mindfulness, and, behavioral, therapy, with, positive, social, support, in, an, article, from, the, association, for, humanistic, psychology, the, benefits, of, humanistic, therapy, are, described, as, having, a, crucial, opportunity, to, lead, our, troubled, culture, back, to, its, own, healthy, path, more, than, any, other, therapy, humanistic, existential, therapy, models, democracy, it, imposes, ideologies, of, others, upon, the, client, less, than, other, therapeutic, practices, freedom, to, choose, is, maximized, we, validate, our, clients, human, potential, in, the, 20th, century, humanistic, psychology, was, referred, to, as, the, third, force, in, psychology, distinct, from, earlier, less, humanistic, approaches, of, psychoanalysis, and, behaviorism, its, principal, professional, organizations, in, the, us, are, the, association, for, humanistic, psychology, and, the, society, for, humanistic, psychology, division, 32, of, the, american, psychological, association, in, britain, there, is, the, uk, association, for, humanistic, psychology, practitioners, through, disagreement, with, the, predominant, theories, at, the, time, developed, by, freud, and, skinner, maslow, was, able, to, formulate, the, main, points, of, humanistic, theory, maslow, had, the, following, criticisms, of, the, two, main, theories, at, the, time, as, a, result, when, maslow, developed, his, theory, he, decided, to, focus, on, the, conscious, rather, than, the, unconscious, and, decided, to, develop, a, new, theory, to, explain, how, all, individuals, could, reach, their, highest, potential, one, of, humanistic, psychology, s, early, sources, was, the, work, of, carl, rogers, who, was, strongly, influenced, by, otto, rank, who, broke, with, freud, in, the, mid, 1920s, rogers, focus, was, to, ensure, that, the, developmental, processes, led, to, healthier, if, not, more, creative, personality, functioning, the, term, actualizing, tendency, was, also, coined, by, rogers, and, was, a, concept, that, eventually, led, abraham, maslow, to, study, self, actualization, as, one, of, the, needs, of, humans, rogers, and, maslow, introduced, this, positive, humanistic, psychology, in, response, to, what, they, viewed, as, the, overly, pessimistic, view, of, psychoanalysis, the, other, sources, of, inspiration, include, the, philosophies, of, existentialism, and, phenomenology, whilst, origins, of, humanistic, psychology, date, back, to, the, early, 1960s, the, origins, of, humanism, date, back, to, the, classical, civilizations, of, china, greece, and, rome, whose, values, were, renewed, in, the, european, renaissance, the, modern, humanistic, approach, has, its, roots, in, phenomenological, and, existentialist, thought, see, kierkegaard, nietzsche, heidegger, merleau, ponty, and, sartre, eastern, philosophy, and, psychology, also, play, a, central, role, in, humanistic, psychology, as, well, as, judeo, christian, philosophies, of, personalism, as, each, shares, similar, concerns, about, the, nature, of, human, existence, and, consciousness, for, further, information, on, influential, figures, in, personalism, see, emmanuel, mounier, gabriel, marcel, denis, de, rougemont, jacques, maritain, martin, buber, emmanuel, levinas, max, scheler, and, karol, wojtyla, as, behaviorism, grew, out, of, ivan, pavlov, s, work, with, the, conditioned, reflex, and, laid, the, foundations, for, academic, psychology, in, the, united, states, associated, with, the, names, of, john, b, watson, and, b, f, skinner, abraham, maslow, gave, behaviorism, the, name, the, first, force, a, force, which, systematically, excluded, the, subjective, data, of, consciousness, and, much, information, bearing, on, the, complexity, of, the, human, personality, and, its, development, behavioral, theory, continued, to, develop, to, both, account, for, simple, and, complex, human, behavior, through, theorists, such, as, arthur, staats, stephen, hayes, and, other, post, skinnerian, researchers, clinical, behavioral, analysis, continues, to, be, widely, employed, in, anxiety, disorder, treatments, mood, disorders, and, even, personality, disorders, the, second, force, arose, out, of, freudian, psychoanalysis, which, were, composed, by, psychologists, like, alfred, adler, erik, erikson, carl, jung, erich, fromm, karen, horney, melanie, klein, harry, stack, sullivan, and, sigmund, freud, himself, maslow, then, emphasized, the, necessity, of, a, third, force, even, though, he, did, not, use, the, term, saying, that, it, is, as, if, freud, supplied, us, the, sick, half, of, psychology, and, we, must, now, fill, it, out, with, the, healthy, half, as, a, critical, review, towards, the, cold, and, distant, approach, of, the, psychoanalysis, and, its, deterministic, way, of, viewing, the, human, being, in, the, late, 1930s, psychologists, interested, in, the, uniquely, human, issues, such, as, the, self, self, actualization, health, hope, love, creativity, nature, being, becoming, individuality, and, meaning, that, is, a, concrete, understanding, of, human, existence, included, abraham, maslow, carl, rogers, and, clark, moustakas, who, were, interested, in, founding, a, professional, association, dedicated, to, a, psychology, focused, on, these, features, of, human, capital, demanded, by, post, industrial, society, the, humanistic, psychology, perspective, is, summarized, by, five, core, principles, or, postulates, of, humanistic, psychology, first, articulated, in, an, article, written, by, james, bugental, in, 1964, and, adapted, by, tom, greening, psychologist, and, long, time, editor, of, the, journal, of, humanistic, psychology, the, five, basic, principles, of, humanistic, psychology, are, while, humanistic, psychology, is, a, specific, division, within, the, american, psychological, association, division, 32, humanistic, psychology, is, not, so, much, a, discipline, within, psychology, as, a, perspective, on, the, human, condition, that, informs, psychological, research, and, practice, wwii, created, practical, pressures, on, military, psychologists, they, had, more, patients, to, see, and, care, for, than, time, or, resources, permitted, the, origins, of, group, therapy, are, here, eric, berne, s, progression, of, books, shows, this, transition, out, of, what, we, might, call, pragmatic, psychology, of, wwii, into, his, later, innovation, transactional, analysis, one, of, the, most, influential, forms, of, humanistic, popular, psychology, of, the, later, 1960s, 1970, even, though, transactional, analysis, was, considered, a, unique, methodology, it, was, challenged, after, berne, s, death, humanistic, psychologists, generally, do, not, believe, that, we, will, understand, human, consciousness, and, behavior, through, mainstream, scientific, research, the, objection, that, humanistic, psychologists, have, to, traditional, research, methods, is, that, they, are, derived, from, and, suited, for, the, physical, sciences, and, not, especially, appropriate, to, studying, the, complexities, and, nuances, of, human, meaning, making, however, humanistic, psychology, has, involved, scientific, research, of, human, behavior, since, its, inception, for, example, a, human, science, view, is, not, opposed, to, quantitative, methods, but, following, edmund, husserl, research, has, remained, part, of, the, humanistic, psychology, agenda, though, with, more, of, a, holistic, than, reductionistic, focus, specific, humanistic, research, methods, evolved, in, the, decades, following, the, formation, of, the, humanistic, psychology, movement, in, november, 1964, key, figures, in, the, movement, gathered, at, old, saybrook, ct, for, the, first, invitational, conference, on, humanistic, psychology, the, meeting, was, a, co, operation, between, the, association, for, humanistic, psychology, ahp, which, sponsored, the, conference, the, hazen, foundation, which, provided, financing, and, wesleyan, university, which, hosted, the, meeting, in, addition, to, the, founding, figures, of, humanistic, psychology, abraham, maslow, rollo, may, james, bugental, and, carl, rogers, the, meeting, attracted, several, academic, profiles, from, the, humanistic, disciplines, including, gordon, allport, george, kelly, clark, moustakas, gardner, murphy, henry, murray, robert, w, white, charlotte, b, hler, floyd, matson, jacques, barzun, and, ren, dubos, robert, knapp, was, chairman, and, henry, murray, gave, the, keynote, address, among, the, intentions, of, the, participants, was, to, formulate, a, new, vision, for, psychology, that, in, their, view, took, into, consideration, a, more, complete, image, of, the, person, than, the, image, presented, by, the, current, trends, of, behaviorism, and, freudian, psychology, according, to, aanstoos, serlin, greening, the, participants, took, issue, with, the, positivistic, trend, in, mainstream, psychology, at, the, time, the, conference, has, been, described, as, a, historic, event, that, was, important, for, the, academic, status, of, humanistic, psychology, and, its, future, aspirations, several, key, theorists, have, been, considered, to, have, prepared, the, ground, for, humanistic, psychology, these, theorists, include, otto, rank, abraham, maslow, carl, rogers, and, rollo, may, this, section, provides, a, short, handed, summary, of, each, individual, s, contributions, for, the, theory, abraham, maslow, in, regards, to, humanistic, theory, maslow, developed, a, hierarchy, of, needs, this, is, a, pyramid, which, basically, states, that, individuals, first, must, have, their, physiological, needs, met, then, safety, then, love, then, self, esteem, and, lastly, self, actualization, people, who, have, met, their, self, actualization, needs, are, self, aware, caring, wise, and, their, interests, are, problem, centered, he, theorized, that, self, actualizing, people, are, continuously, striving, thinking, broadly, and, focusing, on, broader, problems, he, also, believed, however, that, only, 1, of, people, actually, achieved, self, actualization, carl, rogers, rogers, built, upon, maslow, s, theory, and, argued, that, the, process, of, self, actualization, is, nurtured, in, a, growth, promoting, climate, two, conditions, are, required, in, order, for, a, climate, to, be, a, self, actualizing, growth, promoting, climate, the, individual, must, be, able, to, be, their, genuine, self, and, as, the, individual, expresses, their, true, self, they, must, be, accepted, by, others, the, aim, of, humanistic, therapy, is, usually, to, help, the, client, develop, a, stronger, and, healthier, sense, of, self, also, called, self, actualization, humanistic, therapy, attempts, to, teach, clients, that, they, have, potential, for, self, fulfillment, this, type, of, therapy, is, insight, based, meaning, that, the, therapist, attempts, to, provide, the, client, with, insights, about, their, inner, conflicts, humanistic, psychology, includes, several, approaches, to, counseling, and, therapy, among, the, earliest, approaches, we, find, the, developmental, theory, of, abraham, maslow, emphasizing, a, hierarchy, of, needs, and, motivations, the, existential, psychology, of, rollo, may, acknowledging, human, choice, and, the, tragic, aspects, of, human, existence, and, the, person, centered, or, client, centered, therapy, of, carl, rogers, which, is, centered, on, the, client, s, capacity, for, self, direction, and, understanding, of, his, or, her, own, development, client, centered, therapy, is, non, directive, the, therapist, listens, to, the, client, without, judgement, allowing, the, client, to, come, to, insights, by, themselves, the, therapist, should, ensure, that, all, of, the, client, s, feelings, are, being, considered, and, that, the, therapist, has, a, firm, grasp, on, the, concerns, of, the, client, while, ensuring, that, there, is, an, air, of, acceptance, and, warmth, client, centered, therapist, engages, in, active, listening, during, therapy, sessions, a, therapist, cannot, be, completely, non, directive, however, a, nonjudgmental, accepting, environment, that, provides, unconditional, positive, regard, will, encourage, feelings, of, acceptance, and, value, existential, psychotherapies, an, application, of, humanistic, psychology, applies, existential, philosophy, which, emphasizes, the, idea, that, humans, have, the, freedom, to, make, sense, of, their, lives, they, are, free, to, define, themselves, and, do, whatever, it, is, they, want, to, do, this, is, a, type, of, humanistic, therapy, that, forces, the, client, to, explore, the, meaning, of, their, life, as, well, as, its, purpose, there, is, a, conflict, between, having, freedoms, and, having, limitations, examples, of, limitations, include, genetics, culture, and, many, other, factors, existential, therapy, involves, trying, to, resolve, this, conflict, another, approach, to, humanistic, counseling, and, therapy, is, gestalt, therapy, which, puts, a, focus, on, the, here, and, now, especially, as, an, opportunity, to, look, past, any, preconceived, notions, and, focus, on, how, the, present, is, affected, by, the, past, role, playing, also, plays, a, large, role, in, gestalt, therapy, and, allows, for, a, true, expression, of, feelings, that, may, not, have, been, shared, in, other, circumstances, in, gestalt, therapy, non, verbal, cues, are, an, important, indicator, of, how, the, client, may, actually, be, feeling, despite, the, feelings, expressed, also, part, of, the, range, of, humanistic, psychotherapy, are, concepts, from, depth, therapy, holistic, health, encounter, groups, sensitivity, training, marital, and, family, therapies, body, work, the, existential, psychotherapy, of, medard, boss, and, positive, psychology, empathy, is, one, of, the, most, important, features, of, humanistic, therapy, this, idea, focuses, on, the, therapist, s, ability, to, see, the, world, through, the, eyes, of, the, client, without, this, therapists, can, be, forced, to, apply, an, external, frame, of, reference, where, the, therapist, is, no, longer, understanding, the, actions, and, thoughts, of, the, client, as, the, client, would, but, strictly, as, a, therapist, which, defeats, the, purpose, of, humanistic, therapy, included, in, empathizing, unconditional, positive, regard, is, one, of, the, key, elements, of, humanistic, psychology, unconditional, positive, regard, refers, to, the, care, that, the, therapist, needs, to, have, for, the, client, this, ensures, that, the, therapist, does, not, become, the, authority, figure, in, the, relationship, allowing, for, a, more, open, flow, of, information, as, well, as, a, kinder, relationship, between, the, two, a, therapist, practicing, humanistic, therapy, needs, to, show, a, willingness, to, listen, and, ensure, the, comfort, of, the, patient, where, genuine, feelings, may, be, shared, but, are, not, forced, upon, someone, marshall, rosenberg, one, of, carl, rogers, students, emphasizes, empathy, in, the, relationship, in, his, concept, of, nonviolent, communication, self, help, is, also, part, of, humanistic, psychology, sheila, ernst, and, lucy, goodison, have, described, using, some, of, the, main, humanistic, approaches, in, self, help, groups, humanistic, psychology, is, applicable, to, self, help, because, it, is, oriented, towards, changing, the, way, a, person, thinks, one, can, only, improve, once, they, decide, to, change, their, ways, of, thinking, about, themselves, once, they, decide, to, help, themselves, co, counselling, which, is, an, approach, based, purely, on, self, help, is, regarded, as, coming, from, humanistic, psychology, as, well, humanistic, theory, has, had, a, strong, influence, on, other, forms, of, popular, therapy, including, harvey, jackins, re, evaluation, counselling, and, the, work, of, carl, rogers, including, his, student, eugene, gendlin, see, focusing, as, well, as, on, the, development, of, the, humanistic, psychodrama, by, hans, werner, gessmann, since, the, 80s, the, ideal, self, and, real, self, involve, understanding, the, issues, that, arise, from, having, an, idea, of, what, you, wish, you, were, as, a, person, and, having, that, not, match, with, who, you, actually, are, as, a, person, incongruence, the, ideal, self, is, what, a, person, believes, should, be, done, as, well, as, what, their, core, values, are, the, real, self, is, what, is, actually, played, out, in, life, through, humanistic, therapy, an, understanding, of, the, present, allows, clients, to, add, positive, experiences, to, their, real, self, concept, the, goal, is, to, have, the, two, concepts, of, self, become, congruent, rogers, believed, that, only, when, a, therapist, was, able, to, be, congruent, a, real, relationship, occurs, in, therapy, it, is, much, easier, to, trust, someone, who, is, willing, to, share, feelings, openly, even, if, it, may, not, be, what, the, client, always, wants, this, allows, the, therapist, to, foster, a, strong, relationship, humanistic, psychology, tends, to, look, beyond, the, medical, model, of, psychology, in, order, to, open, up, a, non, pathologizing, view, of, the, person, this, usually, implies, that, the, therapist, downplays, the, pathological, aspects, of, a, person, s, life, in, favour, of, the, healthy, aspects, humanistic, psychology, tries, to, be, a, science, of, human, experience, focusing, on, the, actual, lived, experience, of, persons, therefore, a, key, ingredient, is, the, actual, meeting, of, therapist, and, client, and, the, possibilities, for, dialogue, to, ensue, between, them, the, role, of, the, therapist, is, to, create, an, environment, where, the, client, can, freely, express, any, thoughts, or, feelings, he, does, not, suggest, topics, for, conversation, nor, does, he, guide, the, conversation, in, any, way, the, therapist, also, does, not, analyze, or, interpret, the, client, s, behavior, or, any, information, the, client, shares, the, role, of, the, therapist, is, to, provide, empathy, and, to, listen, attentively, to, the, client, while, personal, transformation, may, be, the, primary, focus, of, most, humanistic, psychologists, many, also, investigate, pressing, social, cultural, and, gender, issues, in, an, academic, anthology, from, 2018, british, psychologist, richard, house, and, his, co, editors, wrote, from, its, very, outset, humanistic, psychology, has, engaged, fulsomely, and, fearlessly, with, the, social, cultural, and, political, in, a, way, that, much, of, mainstream, scientific, positivistic, psychology, has, sought, to, avoid, some, of, the, earliest, writers, who, were, associated, with, and, inspired, by, psychological, humanism, explored, socio, political, topics, for, example, relevant, work, was, not, confined, to, these, pioneer, thinkers, in, 1978, members, of, the, association, for, humanistic, psychology, ahp, embarked, on, a, three, year, effort, to, explore, how, the, principles, of, humanistic, psychology, could, be, used, to, further, the, process, of, positive, social, and, political, change, the, effort, included, a, 12, hour, political, party, held, in, san, francisco, in, 1980, where, nearly, 1, 400, attendees, discussed, presentations, by, such, non, traditional, social, thinkers, as, ecotopia, author, ernest, callenbach, aquarian, conspiracy, author, marilyn, ferguson, person, planet, author, theodore, roszak, and, new, age, politics, author, mark, satin, the, emergent, perspective, was, summarized, in, a, manifesto, by, ahp, president, george, leonard, it, proffered, such, ideas, as, moving, to, a, slow, growth, or, no, growth, economy, decentralizing, and, deprofessionalizing, society, and, teaching, social, and, emotional, competencies, in, order, to, provide, a, foundation, for, more, humane, public, policies, and, a, healthier, culture, there, have, been, many, other, attempts, to, articulate, humanistic, psychology, oriented, approaches, to, social, change, for, example, in, 1979, psychologist, kenneth, lux, and, economist, mark, a, lutz, called, for, a, new, economics, based, on, humanistic, psychology, rather, than, utilitarianism, also, in, 1979, california, state, legislator, john, vasconcellos, published, a, book, calling, for, the, integration, of, liberal, politics, and, humanistic, psychological, insight, from, 1979, to, 1983, the, new, world, alliance, a, u, s, political, organization, based, in, washington, d, c, attempted, to, inject, humanistic, psychology, ideas, into, political, thinking, and, processes, sponsors, of, its, newsletter, included, vasconcellos, and, carl, rogers, in, 1989, maureen, o, hara, who, had, worked, with, both, carl, rogers, and, paulo, freire, pointed, to, a, convergence, between, the, two, thinkers, according, to, o, hara, both, focus, on, developing, critical, consciousness, of, situations, which, oppress, and, dehumanize, throughout, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, institute, of, noetic, sciences, president, willis, harman, argued, that, significant, social, change, cannot, occur, without, significant, consciousness, change, in, the, 21st, century, influenced, by, humanistic, psychology, people, such, as, edmund, bourne, joanna, macy, and, marshall, rosenberg, continued, to, apply, psychological, insights, to, social, and, political, issues, in, addition, to, its, uses, in, thinking, about, social, change, humanistic, psychology, is, considered, to, be, the, main, theoretical, and, methodological, source, of, humanistic, social, work, after, psychotherapy, social, work, is, the, most, important, beneficiary, of, the, humanistic, psychology, s, theory, and, methodology, these, theories, have, produced, a, deep, reform, of, the, modern, social, work, practice, and, theory, leading, among, others, to, the, occurrence, of, a, particular, theory, and, methodology, humanistic, social, work, most, values, and, principles, of, the, humanistic, social, work, practice, described, by, malcolm, payne, in, his, book, humanistic, social, work, core, principles, in, practice, directly, originate, from, the, humanistic, psychological, theory, and, humanistic, psychotherapy, practice, namely, creativity, in, human, life, and, practice, developing, self, and, spirituality, developing, security, and, resilience, accountability, flexibility, and, complexity, in, human, life, and, practice, furthermore, the, representation, and, approach, of, the, client, as, human, being, and, social, issue, as, human, issue, in, social, work, is, made, from, the, humanistic, psychology, position, according, to, petru, stefaroi, the, way, humanistic, representation, and, approach, of, the, client, and, their, personality, is, realized, is, in, fact, the, theoretical, axiological, and, methodological, foundation, of, humanistic, social, work, in, setting, goals, and, the, intervention, activities, in, order, to, solve, social, human, problems, there, prevail, critical, terms, and, categories, of, the, humanistic, psychology, and, psychotherapy, such, as, self, actualization, human, potential, holistic, approach, human, being, free, will, subjectivity, human, experience, self, determination, development, spirituality, creativity, positive, thinking, client, centered, and, context, centered, approach, intervention, empathy, personal, growth, empowerment, humanistic, psychology, has, been, utilised, as, a, framework, for, theorizing, the, african, philosophy, of, ubuntu, in, social, work, practice, in, addition, humanistic, social, work, calls, for, the, pursuit, of, social, justice, holistic, service, provision, technological, innovation, and, stewardship, dialogue, and, cooperation, as, well, as, professional, care, and, peer, support, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, humanistic, psychology, s, emphasis, on, creativity, and, wholeness, created, a, foundation, for, new, approaches, towards, human, capital, in, the, workplace, stressing, creativity, and, the, relevance, of, emotional, interactions, previously, the, connotations, of, creativity, were, reserved, for, and, primarily, restricted, to, working, artists, in, the, 1980s, with, increasing, numbers, of, people, working, in, the, cognitive, cultural, economy, creativity, came, to, be, seen, as, a, useful, commodity, and, competitive, edge, for, international, brands, this, led, to, corporate, creativity, training, in, service, trainings, for, employees, led, pre, eminently, by, ned, herrmann, at, g, e, in, the, late, 1970s
