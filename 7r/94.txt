products, and, services, this, is, primarily, because, of, the, transparency, effect, and, consumer, s, pain, of, paying, the, transparency, effect, refers, to, the, idea, that, the, further, you, are, from, cash, as, with, a, credit, card, or, other, forms, of, payment, the, less, transparent, it, is, and, the, less, aware, you, are, of, how, much, you, have, spent, the, less, transparent, or,

they, only, had, cash, available, besides, these, more, formal, debts, private, individuals, also, lend, informally, to, other, people, mostly, relatives, or, friends, one, reason, for, such,

rates, however, this, varies, from, every, claimant, in, that, their, own, eligibility, for, such, is, entirely, dependent, on, their, own, overall, circumstances, should, they, meet, specific, requirements, being, able, to, afford, such, their, requests, are, usually, accepted, should, they, fail, the, criteria, they, re, almost, always, swiftly, rejected, regardless, of, their, financial,

opponents, who, claim, that, it, is, an, unfair, practice, aimed, at, targeting, those, who, are, desperate, and, often, holds, arbitrary, figures, although, those, in, its, defence, claim, it, is, a, security, measure, aimed, at, ensuring, its, repayment, obligations, and, must, take, precautions, before, offering, large, sums, both, arguments, have, resulted, in, greater, debate, amongst,

expenditures, and, other, business, investments, produced, in, their, assets, leveraging, the, return, on, their, equity, this, leverage, the, proportion, of, debt, to, equity, is, considered, paramount, in, determining, the, riskiness, of, an, investment, under, the, notion, that, it, becomes, more, risking, under, more, debt, governments, issue, debt, to, pay, for, ongoing, expenses, as, well, as, major, capital, projects, government, debt, may, be, issued, by, sovereign, states, as, well, as, by, local, governments, sometimes, known, as, municipalities, debt, issued, by, the, government, of, the, united, states, called, treasuries, serves, as, a, reference, point, for, all, other, debt, there, are, deep, transparent, liquid, and, open, capital, markets, for, treasuries, furthermore, treasuries, are, issued, in, a, wide, variety, of, maturities, from, one, day, to, thirty, years, which, facilitates, comparing, the, interest, rates, on, other, debt, to, a, security, of, comparable, maturity, in, finance, the, theoretical, risk, free, interest, rate, is, often, approximated, by, practitioners, by, using, the, current, yield, of, a, treasury, of, the, same, duration, the, overall, level, of, indebtedness, by, a, government, is, typically, shown, as, a, ratio, of, debt, to, gdp, this, ratio, helps, to, assess, the, speed, of, changes, in, government,

issuing, municipality, local, government, but, it, is, a, slower, process, to, accumulate, the, necessary, amount, usually, debt, or, bond, financing, will, not, be, used, to, finance, current, operating, expenditures, the, purposes, of, these, amounts, are, local, developments, capital, investments, constructions, own, contribution, to, other, credits, or, grants, the, debt, service, coverage, ratio, is, the, ratio, of, income, available, to, the, amount, of, debt, service, due, including, both, interest, and, principal, amortization, if, any, the, higher, the, debt, service, coverage, ratio, the, more, income, is, available, to, pay, debt, service, and, the, easier, and, lower, cost, it, will, be, for, a, borrower, to, obtain, financing, different, debt, markets, have, somewhat, different, conventions, in, terminology, and, calculations, for, income, related, metrics, for, example, in, mortgage, lending, in, the, united, states, a, debt, to, income, ratio, typically, includes, the, cost, of, mortgage, payments, as, well, as, insurance, and, property, tax, divided, by, a, consumer, s, monthly, income, a, front, end, ratio, of, 28, or, below, together, with, a, back, end, ratio, including, required, payments, on, non, housing, debt, as, well, of, 36, or, below, is, also, required, to, be, eligible, for, a, conforming, loan, the, loan, to, value, ratio, is, the, ratio, of, the, total, amount, of, the, loan, to, the, total, value, of, the, collateral, securing, the, loan, for, example, in, mortgage, lending, in, the, united, states, the, loan, to, value, concept, is, most, commonly, expressed, as, a, down, payment, a, 20, down, payment, is, equivalent, to, an, 80, loan, to, value, with, home, purchases, value, may, be, assessed, using, the,

which, creditors, do, not, have, recourse, to, the, assets, of, the, borrower, to, satisfy, their, claims, credit, bureaus, collect, information, about, the, borrowing, and, repayment, history, of, consumers, lenders, such, as, banks, and, credit, card, companies, use, credit, scores, to, evaluate, the, potential, risk, posed, by, lending, money, to, consumers, in, the, united, states, the, primary, credit, bureaus, are, equifax, experian, and, transunion, debts, owed, by, governments, and, private, corporations, may, be, rated, by, rating, agencies, such, as, moody, s, standard, poor, s, fitch, ratings, and, a, m, best, the, government, or, company, itself, will, also, be, given, its, own, separate, rating, these, agencies, assess, the, ability, of, the, debtor, to, honor, his, obligations, and, accordingly, give, him, or, her, a, credit, rating, moody, s, uses, the, letters, aaa, aa, a, baa, ba, b, caa, ca, c, where, ratings, aa, caa, are, qualified, by, numbers, 1, 3, s, p, and, other, rating, agencies, have, slightly, different, systems, using, capital, letters, and, qualifiers, thus, a, government, or, corporation, with, a, high, rating, would, have, aaa, rating, a,

example, in, north, america, each, security, is, uniquely, identified, by, a, cusip, for, trading, and, settlement, purposes, in, contrast, loans, are, not, securities, and, do, not, have, cusips, or, the, equivalent, loans, may, be, sold, or, acquired, in, certain, circumstances, as, when, a, bank, syndicates, a, loan, loans, can, be, turned, into, securities, through, the, securitization, process, in, a, securitization, a, company, sells, a, pool, of, assets, to, a, securitization, trust, and, the, securitization, trust, finances, its, purchase, of, the, assets, by, selling, securities, to, the, market, for, example, a, trust, may, own, a, pool, of, home, mortgages, and, be, financed, by, residential, mortgage, backed, securities, in, this, case, the, asset, backed, trust, is, a, debt, issuer, of, residential, mortgage, backed, securities, central, banks, such, as, the, u, s, federal, reserve, system, play, a, key, role, in, the, debt, markets, debt, is, normally, denominated, in, a, particular, currency, and, so, changes, in, the, valuation, of, that, currency, can, change, the, effective, size, of, the, debt, this, can, happen, due, to, inflation, or, deflation, so, it, can, happen, even, though, the, borrower, and, the, lender, are, using, the, same, currency, some, argue, against, debt, as, an, instrument, and, institution, on, a, personal, family, social, corporate, and, governmental, level, some, islamic, banking, forbids, lending, with, interest, even, today, in, hard, times, the, cost, of, servicing, debt, can, grow, beyond, the, debtor, s, ability, to, pay, due, to, either, external, events, income, loss, or, internal, difficulties, poor, management, of, resources, debt, with, an, associated, interest, rate, will, increase, through, time, if, it, is, not, repaid, faster, than, it, grows, through, interest, this, effect, may, be, termed, usury, while, the, term, usury, in, other, contexts, refers, only, to, an, excessive, rate, of, interest, in, excess, of, a, reasonable, profit, for, the, risk, accepted, in, international, legal, thought, odious, debt, is, debt, that, is, incurred, by, a, regime, for, purposes, that, do, not, serve, the, interest, of, the, state, such, debts, are, thus, considered, by, this, doctrine, to, be, personal, debts, of, the, regime, that, incurred, them, and, not, debts, of, the, state, international, third, world, debt, has, reached, the, scale, that, many, economists, are, convinced, that, debt, relief, or, debt, cancellation, is, the, only, way, to, restore, global, equity, in, relations, with, the, developing, nations, excessive, debt, accumulation, has, been, blamed, for, exacerbating, economic, problems, for, example, before, the, great, depression, the, debt, to, gdp, ratio, was, very, high, economic, agents, were, heavily, indebted, this, excess, of, debt, equivalent, to, excessive, expectations, on, future, returns, accompanied, asset, bubbles, on, the, stock, markets, when, expectations, corrected, deflation, and, a, credit, crunch, followed, deflation, effectively, made, debt, more, expensive, and, as, fisher, explained, this, reinforced, deflation, again, because, in, order, to, reduce, their, debt, level, economic, agents, reduced, their, consumption, and, investment, the, reduction, in, demand, reduced, business, activity, and, caused, further, unemployment, in, a, more, direct, sense, more, bankruptcies, also, occurred, due, both, to, increased, debt, cost, caused, by, deflation, and, the, reduced, demand, at, the, household, level, debts, can, also, have, detrimental, effects, particularly, when, households, make, spending, decisions, assuming, income, will, increase, or, remain, stable, in, years, to, come, when, households, take, on, credit, based, on, this, assumption, life, events, can, easily, change, indebtedness, into, over, indebtedness, such, life, events, include, unexpected, unemployment, relationship, break, up, leaving, the, parental, home, business, failure, illness, or, home, repairs, over, indebtedness, has, severe, social, consequences, such, as, financial, hardship, poor, physical, and, mental, health, family, stress, stigma, difficulty, obtaining, employment, exclusion, from, basic, financial, services, european, commission, 2009, work, accidents, and, industrial,

relational, tensions, global, debt, underwriting, grew, 4, 3, percent, year, over, year, to, us, 5, 19, trillion, during, 2004, according, to, historian, paul, johnson, the, lending, of, food, money, was, commonplace, in, middle, eastern, civilizations, as, early, as, 5000, bc, religions, like, judaism, and, christianity, for, example, demand, that, debt, be, forgiven, on, a, regular, basis, in, order, to, prevent, systemic, inequities, between, groups, in, society, or, anyone, becoming, a, specialist, in, holding, debt, and, coercing, repayment, an, example, is, the, biblical, jubilee, year, described, in, the, book, of, leviticus, similarly, in, deuteronomy, chapter, 15, and, verse, 1, states, that, debts, be, forgiven, after, seven, years, this, is, because, biblically, debt, is, seen, as, the, responsibility, of, both, the, creditor, and, the, debtor, traditional, christian, teaching, holds, that, a, lifestyle, of, debt, should, not, be, normative, the, emmanuel, association, a, methodist, denomination, in, the, conservative, holiness, movement, for, example, teaches, we, are, to, refrain, from, entering, into, debt, when, we, have, no, reasonable, plan, to, pay, we, are, to, be, careful, to, meet, all, financial, engagements, promptly, when, due, if, at, all, possible, remembering, that, we, are, to, provide, things, honest, in, the, sight, of, all, men, and, to, owe, no, man, any, thing, but, to, love, one, another, romans, 12, 17, 13, 8
