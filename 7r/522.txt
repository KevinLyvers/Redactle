worldwide, as, a, result, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, this, increase, is, mostly, seen, in, kidnappings, for, ransom, this, factors, from, a, variety, of, aspects, including, socioeconomic, disparities, insufficient, resources, and, flawed, judicial, systems, another, impact, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, on, kidnappers, is, the, economic, strain, that, it, had, put, many, families,

while, the, median, global, ransom, demand, increased, by, 6, in, sub, saharan, africa, regions, such, as, congo, drc, nigeria, and, south, africa, are, likely, to, maintain, higher, levels, of, kidnappings, due, to, ongoing, effects, of, religious, extremist, groups, recent, genocides, and, civil, wars, while, there, is, no, hard, evidence, of, which, country, had, the, most, kidnappings, in, 2021, the, american, region, which, includes, mexico, maintains, its, position, as, the, region, with, the, second, highest, kidnapping, rates, the, annual, number, of, recorded, kidnappings, per, capita, by, country, for, the, last, available, year, according, to, united, nations, office, on, drugs, and, crime, is, shown, in, below, table, each, countries, definition, of, kidnapping, might,
