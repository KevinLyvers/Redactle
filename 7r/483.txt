hungary, and, one, of, the, 24, official, languages, of, the, european, union, outside, hungary, it, is, also, spoken, by, hungarian, communities, in, southern, slovakia, western, ukraine, transcarpathia, central, and, western, romania, transylvania, northern, serbia, vojvodina, northern, croatia, northeastern, slovenia, prekmurje, and, eastern, austria, burgenland, it, is, also, spoken, by, hungarian, diaspora, communities, worldwide, especially, in, north, america, particularly, the, united, states, and, canada, and, israel, with, 14, million, speakers, it, is, the, uralic, family, s, largest, member, by, number, of, speakers, hungarian, is, a, member, of, the, uralic, language, family, linguistic, connections, between, hungarian, and, other, uralic, languages, were, noticed, in, the, 1670s, and, the, family, itself, was, established, in, 1717, hungarian, has, traditionally, been, assigned, to, the, ugric, branch, along, with, the, mansi, and, khanty, languages, of, western, siberia, khanty, mansia, region, of, north, asia, but, it, is, no, longer, clear, that, it, is, a, valid, group, when, the, samoyed, languages, were, determined, to, be, part, of, the, family, it, was, thought, at, first, that, finnic, and, ugric, the, most, divergent, branches, within, finno, ugric, were, closer, to, each, other, than, to, the, samoyed, branch, of, the, family, but, that, is, now, frequently, questioned, the, name, of, hungary, could, be, a, result, of, regular, sound, changes, of, ungrian, ugrian, and, the, fact, that, the, eastern, slavs, referred, to, hungarians, as, gry, grove, sg, grin, seemed, to, confirm, that, current, literature, favors, the, hypothesis, that, it, comes, from, the, name, of, the, turkic, tribe, ono, ur, which, means, ten, arrows, or, ten, tribes, there, are, numerous, regular, sound, correspondences, between, hungarian, and, the, other, ugric, languages, for, example, hungarian, a, corresponds, to, khanty, o, in, certain, positions, and, hungarian, h, corresponds, to, khanty, x, while, hungarian, final, z, corresponds, to, khanty, final, t, for, example, hungarian, h, z, house, vs, khanty, xot, house, and, hungarian, sz, z, hundred, vs, khanty, sot, hundred, the, distance, between, the, ugric, and, finnic, languages, is, greater, but, the, correspondences, are, also, regular, the, traditional, view, holds, that, the, hungarian, language, diverged, from, its, ugric, relatives, in, the, first, half, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, in, western, siberia, east, of, the, southern, urals, in, hungarian, iranian, loanwords, date, back, to, the, time, immediately, following, the, breakup, of, ugric, and, probably, span, well, over, a, millennium, these, include, teh, n, cow, cf, avestan, da, nu, t, z,

present, day, southern, bashkortostan, confirms, the, existence, of, hungarian, settlements, between, the, volga, river, and, the, ural, mountains, the, ono, urs, and, bulgars, later, had, a, great, influence, on, the, language, especially, between, the, 5th, and, 9th, centuries, this, layer, of, turkic, loans, is, large, and, varied, e, g, sz, word, from, turkic, and, daru, crane, from, the,

in, a, similarly, dramatic, way, over, these, three, centuries, after, the, arrival, of, the, hungarians, in, the, carpathian, basin, the, language, came, into, contact, with, a, variety, of, speech, communities, among, them, slavic, turkic, and, german, turkic, loans, from, this, period, come, mainly, from, the, pechenegs, and, cumanians, who, settled, in, hungary, during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, e, g, koboz, cobza, cf, turkish, kopuz, lute, komondor, mop, dog, kumandur, cuman, hungarian, borrowed, 20, of, words, from, neighbouring, slavic, languages, e, g, t, gla, brick, m, k,

about, 1, 6, percent, of, the, romanian, lexicon, is, of, hungarian, origin, in, the, 21st, century, studies, support, an, origin, of, the, uralic, languages, including, early, hungarian, in, eastern, or, central, siberia, somewhere, between, the, ob, and, yenisei, rivers, or, near, the, sayan, mountains, in, the, russian, mongolian, border, region, a, 2019, study, based, on, genetics, archaeology, and, linguistics, found, that, early, uralic, speakers, arrived, in, europe, from, the, east, specifically, from, eastern, siberia, hungarian, historian, and, archaeologist, gyula, l, szl, claims, that, geological, data, from, pollen, analysis, seems, to, contradict, the, placing, of, the, ancient, hungarian, homeland, near, the, urals, today, the, consensus, among, linguists, is, that, hungarian, is, a, member, of, the, uralic, family, of, languages, the, classification, of, hungarian, as, a, uralic, finno, ugric, rather, than, a, turkic, language, continued, to, be, a, matter, of, impassioned, political, controversy, throughout, the, 18th, and, into, the, 19th, centuries, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, a, competing, hypothesis, proposed, a, turkic, affinity, of, hungarian, or, alternatively, that, both, the, uralic, and, the, turkic, families, formed, part, of, a, superfamily, of, ural, altaic, languages, following, an, academic, debate, known, as, az, ugor, t, r, k, h, bor, the, ugric, turkic, war, the, finno, ugric, hypothesis, was, concluded, the, sounder, of, the, two, mainly, based, on, work, by, the, german, linguist, josef, budenz, hungarians, did, in, fact, absorb, some, turkic, influences, during, several, centuries, of, cohabitation, the, influence, on, hungarians, was, mainly, from, the, turkic, oghur, speakers, such, as, sabirs, bulgars, of, atil, kabars, and, khazars, the, oghur, tribes, are, often, connected, with, the, hungarians, whose, exoethnonym, is, usually, derived, from, onogurs, h, ungars, a, turkic, tribal, confederation, the, similarity, between, customs, of, hungarians, and, the, chuvash, people, the, only, surviving, member, of, the, oghur, tribes, is, visible, for, example, the, hungarians, appear, to, have, learned, animal, husbandry, techniques, from, the, oghur, speaking, chuvash, people, or, historically, suvar, people, as, a, high, proportion, of, words, specific, to, agriculture, and, livestock, are, of, chuvash, origin, a, strong, chuvash, influence, was, also, apparent, in, hungarian, burial, customs, the, first, written, accounts, of, hungarian, date, to, the, 10th, century, such, as, mostly, hungarian, personal, names, and, place, names, in, de, administrando, imperio, written, in, greek, by, eastern, roman, emperor, constantine, vii, no, significant, texts, written, in, old, hungarian, script, have, survived, because, the, medium, of, writing, used, at, the, time, wood, is, perishable, the, kingdom, of, hungary, was, founded, in, 1000, by, stephen, i, the, country, became, a, western, styled, christian, roman, catholic, state, with, latin, script, replacing, hungarian, runes, the, earliest, remaining, fragments, of, the, language, are, found, in, the, establishing, charter, of, the, abbey, of, tihany, from, 1055, intermingled, with, latin, text, the, first, extant, text, fully, written, in, hungarian, is, the, funeral, sermon, and, prayer, which, dates, to, the, 1190s, although, the, orthography, of, these, early, texts, differed, considerably, from, that, used, today, contemporary, hungarians, can, still, understand, a, great, deal, of, the, reconstructed, spoken, language, despite, changes, in, grammar, and, vocabulary, a, more, extensive, body, of, hungarian, literature, arose, after, 1300, the, earliest, known, example, of, hungarian, religious, poetry, is, the, 14th, century, lamentations, of, mary, the, first, bible, translation, was, the, hussite, bible, in, the, 1430s, the, standard, language, lost, its, diphthongs, and, several, postpositions, transformed, into, suffixes, including, re, onto, the, phrase, utu, rea, onto, the, way, found, in, the, 1055, text, would, later, become, t, ra, there, were, also, changes, in, the, system, of, vowel, harmony, at, one, time, hungarian, used, six, verb, tenses, while, today, only, two, or, three, are, used, in, 1533, krak, w, printer, benedek, komj, ti, published, letters, of, st, paul, in, hungarian, modern, orthography, a, szent, p, l, levelei, magyar, nyelven, the, first, hungarian, language, book, set, in, movable, type, by, the, 17th, century, the, language, already, closely, resembled, its, present, day, form, although, two, of, the, past, tenses, remained, in, use, german, italian, and, french, loans, also, began, to, appear, further, turkish, words, were, borrowed, during, the, period, of, ottoman, rule, 1541, to, 1699, in, the, 19th, century, a, group, of, writers, most, notably, ferenc, kazinczy, spearheaded, a, process, of, nyelv, j, t, s, language, revitalization, some, words, were, shortened, gy, zedelem, gy, zelem, victory, or, triumph, a, number, of, dialectal, words, spread, nationally, e, g, cselleng, dawdle, extinct, words, were, reintroduced, d, sz, d, cor, a, wide, range, of, expressions, were, coined, using, the, various, derivative, suffixes, and, some, other, less, frequently, used, methods, of, expanding, the, language, were, utilized, this, movement, produced, more, than, ten, thousand, words, most, of, which, are, used, actively, today, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, saw, further, standardization, of, the, language, and, differences, between, mutually, comprehensible, dialects, gradually, diminished, in, 1920, hungary, signed, the, treaty, of, trianon, losing, 71, percent, of, its, territory, and, one, third, of, the, ethnic, hungarian, population, along, with, it, today, the, language, holds, official, status, nationally, in, hungary, and, regionally, in, romania, slovakia, serbia, austria, and, slovenia, in, 2014, the, proportion, of, transylvanian, students, studying, hungarian, exceeded, the, proportion, of, hungarian, students, which, shows, that, the, effects, of, romanianization, are, slowly, getting, reversed, and, regaining, popularity, the, dictate, of, trianon, resulted, in, a, high, proportion, of, hungarians, in, the, surrounding, 7, countries, so, it, is, widely, spoken, or, understood, although, host, countries, are, not, always, considerate, of, hungarian, language, users, communities, are, strong, the, szeklers, for, example, form, their, own, region, and, have, their, own, national, museum, educational, institutions, and, hospitals, hungarian, has, about, 13, million, native, speakers, of, whom, more, than, 9, 8, million, live, in, hungary, according, to, the, 2011, hungarian, census, 9, 896, 333, people, 99, 6, of, the, total, population, speak, hungarian, of, whom, 9, 827, 875, people, 98, 9, speak, it, as, a, first, language, while, 68, 458, people, 0, 7, speak, it, as, a, second, language, about, 2, 2, million, speakers, live, in, other, areas, that, were, part, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, before, the, treaty, of, trianon, 1920, of, these, the, largest, group, lives, in, transylvania, the, western, half, of, present, day, romania, where, there, are, approximately, 1, 25, million, hungarians, there, are, large, hungarian, communities, also, in, slovakia, serbia, and, ukraine, and, hungarians, can, also, be, found, in, austria, croatia, and, slovenia, as, well, as, about, a, million, additional, people, scattered, in, other, parts, of, the, world, for, example, there, are, more, than, one, hundred, thousand, hungarian, speakers, in, the, hungarian, american, community, and, 1, 5, million, with, hungarian, ancestry, in, the, united, states, hungarian, is, the, official, language, of, hungary, and, thus, an, official, language, of, the, european, union, hungarian, is, also, one, of, the, official, languages, of, serbian, province, of, vojvodina, and, an, official, language, of, three, municipalities, in, slovenia, hodo, dobrovnik, and, lendava, along, with, slovene, hungarian, is, officially, recognized, as, a, minority, or, regional, language, in, austria, croatia, romania, zakarpattia, in, ukraine, and, slovakia, in, romania, it, is, a, recognized, minority, language, used, at, local, level, in, communes, towns, and, municipalities, with, an, ethnic, hungarian, population, of, over, 20, the, dialects, of, hungarian, identified, by, ethnologue, are, alf, ld, west, danube, danube, tisza, king, s, pass, hungarian, northeast, hungarian, northwest, hungarian, sz, kely, and, west, hungarian, these, dialects, are, for, the, most, part, mutually, intelligible, the, hungarian, cs, ng, dialect, which, is, mentioned, but, not, listed, separately, by, ethnologue, is, spoken, primarily, in, bac, u, county, in, eastern, romania, the, cs, ng, hungarian, group, has, been, largely, isolated, from, other, hungarian, people, and, therefore, preserved, features, that, closely, resemble, earlier, forms, of, hungarian, hungarian, has, 14, vowel, phonemes, and, 25, consonant, phonemes, the, vowel, phonemes, can, be, grouped, as, pairs, of, short, and, long, vowels, such, as, o, and, most, of, the, pairs, have, an, almost, similar, pronunciation, and, vary, significantly, only, in, their, duration, however, pairs, a, and, e, differ, both, in, closedness, and, length, consonant, length, is, also, distinctive, in, hungarian, most, consonant, phonemes, can, occur, as, geminates, the, sound, voiced, palatal, plosive, written, gy, sounds, similar, to, d, in, british, english, duty, it, occurs, in, the, name, of, the, country, magyarorsz, g, hungary, pronounced, m, rorsa, it, is, one, of, three, palatal, consonants, the, others, being, ty, and, ny, historically, a, fourth, palatalized, consonant, existed, still, written, ly, a, single, r, is, pronounced, as, an, alveolar, tap, akkora, of, that, size, but, a, double, r, is, pronounced, as, an, alveolar, trill, akkorra, by, that, time, like, in, spanish, and, italian, primary, stress, is, always, on, the, first, syllable, of, a, word, as, in, finnish, and, the, neighbouring, slovak, and, czech, there, is, a, secondary, stress, on, other, syllables, in, compounds, viszontl, t, sra, goodbye, is, pronounced, visont, la, ta, r, elongated, vowels, in, non, initial, syllables, may, seem, to, be, stressed, to, an, english, speaker, as, length, and, stress, correlate, in, english, hungarian, is, an, agglutinative, language, it, uses, various, affixes, mainly, suffixes, but, also, some, prefixes, and, a, circumfix, to, change, a, word, s, meaning, and, its, grammatical, function, hungarian, uses, vowel, harmony, to, attach, suffixes, to, words, that, means, that, most, suffixes, have, two, or, three, different, forms, and, the, choice, between, them, depends, on, the, vowels, of, the, head, word, there, are, some, minor, and, unpredictable, exceptions, to, the, rule, nouns, have, 18, cases, which, are, formed, regularly, with, suffixes, the, nominative, case, is, unmarked, az, alma, the, apple, and, for, example, the, accusative, is, marked, with, the, suffix, t, az, alm, t, the, apple, half, of, the, cases, express, a, combination, of, the, source, location, target, and, surface, inside, proximity, ternary, distinctions, three, times, three, cases, there, is, a, separate, case, ending, b, l, b, l, meaning, a, combination, of, source, and, insideness, from, inside, of, possession, is, expressed, by, a, possessive, suffix, on, the, possessed, object, rather, than, the, possessor, as, in, english, peter, s, apple, becomes, p, ter, alm, ja, literally, peter, apple, his, noun, plurals, are, formed, with, k, az, alm, k, the, apples, but, after, a, numeral, the, singular, is, used, k, t, alma, two, apples, literally, two, apple, not, k, t, alm, k, unlike, english, hungarian, uses, case, suffixes, and, nearly, always, postpositions, instead, of, prepositions, there, are, two, types, of, articles, in, hungarian, definite, and, indefinite, which, roughly, correspond, to, the, equivalents, in, english, adjectives, precede, nouns, a, piros, alma, the, red, apple, and, have, three, degrees, positive, piros, red, comparative, pirosabb, redder, and, superlative, a, legpirosabb, the, reddest, if, the, noun, takes, the, plural, or, a, case, an, attributive, adjective, is, invariable, a, piros, alm, k, the, red, apples, however, a, predicative, adjective, agrees, with, the, noun, az, alm, k, piros, ak, the, apples, are, red, adjectives, by, themselves, can, behave, as, nouns, and, so, can, take, case, suffixes, melyik, alm, t, k, red, a, piros, at, which, apple, would, you, like, the, red, one, the, neutral, word, order, is, subject, verb, object, svo, however, hungarian, is, a, topic, prominent, language, and, so, has, a, word, order, that, depends, not, only, on, syntax, but, also, on, the, topic, comment, structure, of, the, sentence, for, example, what, aspect, is, assumed, to, be, known, and, what, is, emphasized, a, hungarian, sentence, generally, has, the, following, order, topic, comment, or, focus, verb, and, the, rest, the, topic, shows, that, the, proposition, is, only, for, that, particular, thing, or, aspect, and, it, implies, that, the, proposition, is, not, true, for, some, others, for, example, in, az, alm, t, j, nos, l, tja, it, is, john, who, sees, the, apple, literally, the, apple, john, sees, the, apple, is, in, the, topic, implying, that, other, objects, may, be, seen, by, not, him, but, other, people, the, pear, may, be, seen, by, peter, the, topic, part, may, be, empty, the, focus, shows, the, new, information, for, the, listeners, that, may, not, have, been, known, or, that, their, knowledge, must, be, corrected, for, example, n, vagyok, az, ap, d, i, am, your, father, literally, it, is, i, who, am, your, father, from, the, movie, the, empire, strikes, back, the, pronoun, i, n, is, in, the, focus, and, implies, that, it, is, new, information, and, the, listener, thought, that, someone, else, is, his, father, although, hungarian, is, sometimes, described, as, having, free, word, order, different, word, orders, are, generally, not, interchangeable, and, the, neutral, order, is, not, always, correct, to, use, the, intonation, is, also, different, with, different, topic, comment, structures, the, topic, usually, has, a, rising, intonation, the, focus, having, a, falling, intonation, in, the, following, examples, the, topic, is, marked, with, italics, and, the, focus, comment, is, marked, with, boldface, hungarian, has, a, four, tiered, system, for, expressing, levels, of, politeness, from, highest, to, lowest, the, four, tiered, system, has, somewhat, been, eroded, due, to, the, recent, expansion, of, tegez, d, s, and, n, z, s, some, anomalies, emerged, with, the, arrival, of, multinational, companies, who, have, addressed, their, customers, in, the, te, least, polite, form, right, from, the, beginning, of, their, presence, in, hungary, a, typical, example, is, the, swedish, furniture, shop, ikea, whose, web, site, and, other, publications, address, the, customers, in, te, form, when, a, news, site, asked, ikea, using, the, te, form, why, they, address, their, customers, this, way, ikea, s, pr, manager, explained, in, his, answer, using, the, n, form, that, their, way, of, communication, reflects, ikea, s, open, mindedness, and, the, swedish, culture, however, ikea, in, france, uses, the, polite, vous, form, another, example, is, the, communication, of, yettel, hungary, earlier, telenor, a, mobile, network, operator, towards, its, customers, yettel, chose, to, communicate, towards, business, customers, in, the, polite, n, form, while, all, other, customers, are, addressed, in, the, less, polite, te, form, during, the, first, early, phase, of, hungarian, language, reforms, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, more, than, ten, thousand, words, were, coined, several, thousand, of, which, are, still, actively, used, today, see, also, ferenc, kazinczy, the, leading, figure, of, the, hungarian, language, reforms, kazinczy, s, chief, goal, was, to, replace, existing, words, of, german, and, latin, origins, with, newly, created, hungarian, words, as, a, result, kazinczy, and, his, later, followers, the, reformers, significantly, reduced, the, formerly, high, ratio, of, words, of, latin, and, german, origins, in, the, hungarian, language, which, were, related, to, social, sciences, natural, sciences, politics, and, economics, institutional, names, fashion, etc, giving, an, accurate, estimate, for, the, total, word, count, is, difficult, since, it, is, hard, to, define, a, word, in, agglutinating, languages, due, to, the, existence, of, affixed, words, and, compound, words, to, obtain, a, meaningful, definition, of, compound, words, it, is, necessary, to, exclude, compounds, whose, meaning, is, the, mere, sum, of, its, elements, the, largest, dictionaries, giving, translations, from, hungarian, to, another, language, contain, 120, 000, words, and, phrases, but, this, may, include, redundant, phrases, as, well, because, of, translation, issues, the, new, desk, lexicon, of, the, hungarian, language, contains, 75, 000, words, and, the, comprehensive, dictionary, of, hungarian, language, to, be, published, in, 18, volumes, in, the, next, twenty, years, is, planned, to, contain, 110, 000, words, the, default, hungarian, lexicon, is, usually, estimated, to, comprise, 60, 000, to, 100, 000, words, independently, of, specific, languages, speakers, actively, use, at, most, 10, 000, to, 20, 000, words, with, an, average, intellectual, using, 25, 000, to, 30, 000, words, however, all, the, hungarian, lexemes, collected, from, technical, texts, dialects, etc, would, total, up, to, 1, 000, 000, words, parts, of, the, lexicon, can, be, organized, using, word, bushes, see, an, example, on, the, right, the, words, in, these, bushes, share, a, common, root, are, related, through, inflection, derivation, and, compounding, and, are, usually, broadly, related, in, meaning, the, basic, vocabulary, shares, several, hundred, word, roots, with, other, uralic, languages, like, finnish, estonian, mansi, and, khanty, examples, are, the, verb, l, live, finnish, el, the, numbers, kett, 2, h, rom, 3, n, gy, 4, cf, mansi, kitig, khurum, nila, finnish, kaksi, kolme, nelj, estonian, kaks, kolm, neli, as, well, as, v, z, water, k, z, hand, v, r, blood, fej, head, cf, finnish, and, estonian, vesi, k, si, veri, finnish, p, estonian, pea, or, p, words, for, elementary, kinship, and, nature, are, more, ugric, less, r, turkic, and, less, slavic, words, related, to, agriculture, are, about, 50, r, turkic, and, 50, slavic, pastoral, terms, are, more, r, turkic, less, ugric, and, less, slavic, finally, christian, and, state, terminology, is, more, slavic, and, less, r, turkic, the, slavic, is, most, probably, proto, slovakian, and, or, slovenian, this, is, easily, understood, in, the, uralic, paradigm, proto, magyars, were, first, similar, to, ob, ugors, who, were, mainly, hunters, fishers, and, gatherers, but, with, some, horses, too, then, they, accultured, to, bulgarian, r, turks, so, the, older, layer, of, agriculture, words, wine, beer, wheat, barley, etc, are, purely, r, turkic, and, many, terms, of, statesmanship, and, religion, were, too, except, for, a, few, latin, and, greek, loanwords, these, differences, are, unnoticed, even, by, native, speakers, the, words, have, been, entirely, adopted, into, the, hungarian, lexicon, there, are, an, increasing, number, of, english, loanwords, especially, in, technical, fields, and, slang, as, well, calculating, the, percentile, fractions, of, the, origins, of, various, words, within, a, language, is, an, essentially, meaningless, and, impossible, exercise, there, is, no, definite, set, number, of, words, within, a, language, that, can, be, tallied, up, and, other, factors, like, the, frequency, of, use, and, dialectal, differences, also, affect, the, end, result, an, approximate, estimate, of, the, number, of, foreign, loanwords, in, hungarian, can, be, established, as, well, as, the, general, frequency, of, their, usage, according, to, estiamtes, the, most, numerous, loanwords, come, from, slavic, languages, 1252, words, of, proven, slavic, origin, around, 484, universally, used, in, all, dialects, of, hungarian, 694, in, specific, dialects, only, and, 74, obsolete, words, an, additional, 382, words, are, classified, as, possibly, slavic, 147, of, them, present, in, all, dialects, 209, present, in, certain, dialects, and, 26, no, longer, in, common, use, bringing, the, final, number, of, potentially, slavic, loanwords, in, all, dialects, to, 631, and, the, total, number, of, potentially, slavic, loanwords, across, all, dialects, to, about, 1634, the, second, largest, group, of, loanwords, are, made, up, of, turkic, loanwords, which, can, be, divided, into, pre, conquest, and, ottoman, layers, with, the, pre, conquest, words, making, up, the, absolute, majority, of, them, due, to, centuries, of, cohabitation, with, turkic, peoples, such, as, the, volga, bulgars, and, khazars, the, exact, origin, of, certain, words, can, be, hard, to, pin, down, the, number, of, turkic, loanwords, can, be, difficult, to, enumerate, from, the, pre, conquest, period, due, to, a, lack, of, written, sources, from, r, turkic, languages, from, the, period, and, even, later, but, generally, the, number, of, turkic, loanwords, are, estimated, to, be, between, 300, 500, the, third, largest, group, is, made, up, of, german, loanwords, which, number, around, 400, these, started, appearing, in, the, language, as, early, as, the, 11th, century, but, became, especially, prominent, during, the, habsburg, era, starting, in, the, 16th, century, a, much, smaller, but, also, much, older, layer, of, loanwords, are, iranian, loanwords, which, only, number, in, the, dozens, but, serve, as, an, important, layer, of, the, vocabulary, these, words, include, teh, n, cow, tej, milk, asszony, married, woman, wife, v, m, tax, v, r, fortress, v, s, r, market, veg, glass, etc, other, mostly, more, technical, religious, or, scholarly, loanwords, also, numbering, in, the, dozens, are, from, latin, and, greek, while, newer, layers, may, include, virtually, any, european, language, that, hungarian, has, been, in, contact, with, over, the, centuries, words, can, be, compounds, or, derived, most, derivation, is, with, suffixes, but, there, is, a, small, set, of, derivational, prefixes, as, well, compounds, have, been, present, in, the, language, since, the, proto, uralic, era, numerous, ancient, compounds, transformed, to, base, words, during, the, centuries, today, compounds, play, an, important, role, in, vocabulary, a, good, example, is, the, word, arc, compounds, are, made, up, of, two, base, words, the, first, is, the, prefix, the, latter, is, the, suffix, a, compound, can, be, subordinative, the, prefix, is, in, logical, connection, with, the, suffix, if, the, prefix, is, the, subject, of, the, suffix, the, compound, is, generally, classified, as, a, subjective, one, there, are, objective, determinative, and, adjunctive, compounds, as, well, some, examples, are, given, below, according, to, current, orthographic, rules, a, subordinative, compound, word, has, to, be, written, as, a, single, word, without, spaces, however, if, a, compound, of, three, or, more, words, not, counting, one, syllable, verbal, prefixes, is, seven, or, more, syllables, long, not, counting, case, suffixes, a, hyphen, must, be, inserted, at, the, appropriate, boundary, to, ease, the, determination, of, word, boundaries, for, the, reader, other, compound, words, are, coordinatives, there, is, no, concrete, relation, between, the, prefix, and, the, suffix, subcategories, include, reduplication, to, emphasise, the, meaning, olykor, olykor, really, occasionally, twin, words, where, a, base, word, and, a, distorted, form, of, it, makes, up, a, compound, gizgaz, where, the, suffix, gaz, means, weed, and, the, prefix, giz, is, the, distorted, form, the, compound, itself, means, inconsiderable, weed, and, such, compounds, which, have, meanings, but, neither, their, prefixes, nor, their, suffixes, make, sense, for, example, hercehurca, complex, obsolete, procedures, a, compound, also, can, be, made, up, by, multiple, i, e, more, than, two, base, words, in, this, case, at, least, one, word, element, or, even, both, the, prefix, and, the, suffix, is, a, compound, some, examples, hungarian, words, for, the, points, of, the, compass, are, directly, derived, from, the, position, of, the, sun, during, the, day, in, the, northern, hemisphere, there, are, two, basic, words, for, red, in, hungarian, piros, and, v, r, s, variant, veres, compare, with, estonian, verev, or, finnish, punainen, they, are, basic, in, the, sense, that, one, is, not, a, sub, type, of, the, other, as, the, english, scarlet, is, of, red, the, word, v, r, s, is, related, to, v, r, meaning, blood, finnish, and, estonian, veri, when, they, refer, to, an, actual, difference, in, colour, as, on, a, colour, chart, v, r, s, usually, refers, to, the, deeper, darker, and, or, more, red, and, less, orange, hue, of, red, in, english, similar, differences, exist, between, scarlet, and, red, while, many, languages, have, multiple, names, for, this, colour, often, hungarian, scholars, assume, that, this, is, unique, in, recognizing, two, shades, of, red, as, separate, and, distinct, folk, colours, however, the, two, words, are, also, used, independently, of, the, above, in, collocations, piros, is, learned, by, children, first, as, it, is, generally, used, to, describe, inanimate, artificial, things, or, things, seen, as, cheerful, or, neutral, while, v, r, s, typically, refers, to, animate, or, natural, things, biological, geological, physical, and, astronomical, objects, as, well, as, serious, or, emotionally, charged, subjects, when, the, rules, outlined, above, are, in, contradiction, typical, collocations, usually, prevail, in, some, cases, where, a, typical, collocation, does, not, exist, the, use, of, either, of, the, two, words, may, be, equally, adequate, examples, the, hungarian, words, for, brothers, and, sisters, are, differentiated, based, upon, relative, age, there, is, also, a, general, word, for, sibling, testv, r, from, test, body, and, v, r, blood, i, e, originating, from, the, same, body, and, blood, there, used, to, be, a, separate, word, for, elder, sister, n, ne, but, it, has, become, obsolete, and, has, been, replaced, by, the, generic, word, for, sister, in, addition, there, are, separate, prefixes, for, several, ancestors, and, descendants, grandparent, or, k, k, k, nagy, sz, l, the, words, for, boy, and, girl, are, applied, with, possessive, suffixes, nevertheless, the, terms, are, differentiated, with, different, declension, or, lexemes, fia, is, only, used, in, this, irregular, possessive, form, it, has, no, nominative, on, its, own, see, inalienable, possession, however, the, word, fi, can, also, take, the, regular, suffix, in, which, case, the, resulting, word, fi, ja, will, refer, to, a, lover, or, partner, boyfriend, rather, than, a, male, offspring, the, word, fi, boy, is, also, often, noted, as, an, extreme, example, of, the, ability, of, the, language, to, add, suffixes, to, a, word, by, forming, fiai, i, adding, vowel, form, suffixes, only, where, the, result, is, quite, a, frequently, used, word, the, above, word, is, often, considered, to, be, the, longest, word, in, hungarian, although, there, are, longer, words, like, words, of, such, length, are, not, used, in, practice, and, are, difficult, to, understand, even, for, natives, they, were, invented, to, show, in, a, somewhat, facetious, way, the, ability, of, the, language, to, form, long, words, see, agglutinative, language, they, are, not, compound, words, but, are, formed, by, adding, a, series, of, one, and, two, syllable, suffixes, and, a, few, prefixes, to, a, simple, root, szent, saint, or, holy, there, is, virtually, no, limit, for, the, length, of, words, but, when, too, many, suffixes, are, added, the, meaning, of, the, word, becomes, less, clear, and, the, word, becomes, hard, to, understand, and, will, work, like, a, riddle, even, for, native, speakers, the, english, word, best, known, as, being, of, hungarian, origin, is, probably, paprika, from, serbo, croatian, papar, pepper, and, the, hungarian, diminutive, ka, the, most, common, however, is, coach, from, kocsi, originally, kocsi, szek, r, car, from, in, the, style, of, kocs, others, are, the, hungarian, language, was, originally, written, in, right, to, left, old, hungarian, runes, superficially, similar, in, appearance, to, the, better, known, futhark, runes, but, unrelated, after, stephen, i, of, hungary, established, the, kingdom, of, hungary, in, the, year, 1000, the, old, system, was, gradually, discarded, in, favour, of, the, latin, alphabet, and, left, to, right, order, although, now, not, used, at, all, in, everyday, life, the, old, script, is, still, known, and, practised, by, some, enthusiasts, modern, hungarian, is, written, using, an, expanded, latin, alphabet, and, has, a, phonemic, orthography, i, e, pronunciation, can, generally, be, predicted, from, the, written, language, in, addition, to, the, standard, letters, of, the, latin, alphabet, hungarian, uses, several, modified, latin, characters, to, represent, the, additional, vowel, sounds, of, the, language, these, include, letters, with, acute, accents, to, represent, long, vowels, and, umlauts, and, and, their, long, counterparts, and, to, represent, front, vowels, sometimes, usually, as, a, result, of, a, technical, glitch, on, a, computer, or, is, used, for, and, for, this, is, often, due, to, the, limitations, of, the, latin, 1, iso, 8859, 1, code, page, these, letters, are, not, part, of, the, hungarian, language, and, are, considered, misprints, hungarian, can, be, properly, represented, with, the, latin, 2, iso, 8859, 2, code, page, but, this, code, page, is, not, always, available, hungarian, is, the, only, language, using, both, and, unicode, includes, them, and, so, they, can, be, used, on, the, internet, additionally, the, letter, pairs, ny, ty, and, gy, word, is, the, palatal, consonants, c, and, roughly, analogous, to, the, d, y, sounds, in, british, du, ke, or, american, woul, d, y, ou, produced, using, a, similar, mechanism, as, the, letter, d, when, pronounced, with, the, tongue, pointing, to, the, palate, hungarian, uses, s, for, and, sz, for, s, which, is, the, reverse, of, polish, usage, the, letter, zs, is, and, cs, is, t, these, digraphs, are, considered, single, letters, in, the, alphabet, the, letter, ly, is, also, a, single, letter, digraph, but, is, pronounced, like, j, english, y, and, appears, mostly, in, old, words, the, letters, dz, and, dzs, d, are, exotic, remnants, and, are, hard, to, find, even, in, longer, texts, some, examples, still, in, common, use, are, madzag, string, edzeni, to, train, athletically, and, dzsungel, jungle, sometimes, additional, information, is, required, for, partitioning, words, with, digraphs, h, zsz, m, street, number, h, z, house, sz, m, number, not, an, unintelligible, h, zs, z, m, hungarian, distinguishes, between, long, and, short, vowels, with, long, vowels, written, with, acutes, it, also, distinguishes, between, long, and, short, consonants, with, long, consonants, being, doubled, for, example, lenni, to, be, hozz, sz, l, s, comment, the, digraphs, when, pronounced, as, long, consonants, are, written, as, trigraphs, sz, sz, ssz, e, g, m, v, sszel, with, an, artist, but, when, a, word, is, hyphenated, at, such, a, doubled, digraph, the, digraph, is, written, out, in, full, both, before, and, after, the, hyphen, for, example, with, a, bus, when, the, first, lexeme, of, a, compound, ends, in, a, digraph, and, the, second, lexeme, starts, with, the, same, digraph, both, digraphs, are, written, out, jegy, gy, r, jegygy, r, engagement, wedding, ring, jegy, means, sign, mark, the, term, jegyben, lenni, j, rni, means, to, be, engaged, gy, r, means, ring, almost, all, trigraphs, found, in, hungarian, text, are, the, result, of, doubled, digraphs, but, there, are, a, few, exceptions, tizennyolc, eighteen, is, a, concatenation, of, tizen, nyolc, hungarian, has, minimal, pairs, of, single, vs, double, consonants, for, example, tol, push, vs, toll, feather, or, pen, while, to, english, speakers, they, may, seem, unusual, at, first, once, the, new, orthography, and, pronunciation, are, learned, written, hungarian, is, almost, completely, phonemic, except, for, etymological, spellings, and, ly, j, representing, j, the, word, order, is, basically, from, general, to, specific, this, is, a, typical, analytical, approach, and, is, used, generally, in, hungarian, the, hungarian, language, uses, the, so, called, eastern, name, order, in, which, the, surname, general, deriving, from, the, family, comes, first, and, the, given, name, comes, last, if, a, second, given, name, is, used, this, follows, the, first, given, name, for, clarity, in, foreign, languages, hungarian, names, are, usually, represented, in, the, western, name, order, sometimes, however, especially, in, the, neighbouring, countries, of, hungary, where, there, is, a, significant, hungarian, population, the, hungarian, name, order, is, retained, as, it, causes, less, confusion, there, for, an, example, of, foreign, use, the, birth, name, of, the, hungarian, born, physicist, called, the, father, of, the, hydrogen, bomb, was, teller, ede, but, he, immigrated, to, the, united, states, in, the, 1930s, and, thus, became, known, as, edward, teller, prior, to, the, mid, 20th, century, given, names, were, usually, translated, along, with, the, name, order, this, is, no, longer, as, common, for, example, the, pianist, uses, andr, s, schiff, when, abroad, not, andrew, schiff, in, hungarian, schiff, andr, s, if, a, second, given, name, is, present, it, becomes, a, middle, name, and, is, usually, written, out, in, full, rather, than, truncated, to, an, initial, in, modern, usage, foreign, names, retain, their, order, when, used, in, hungarian, therefore, before, the, 20th, century, not, only, was, it, common, to, reverse, the, order, of, foreign, personalities, they, were, also, hungarianised, goethe, j, nos, farkas, originally, johann, wolfgang, goethe, this, usage, sounds, odd, today, when, only, a, few, well, known, personalities, are, referred, to, using, their, hungarianised, names, including, verne, gyula, jules, verne, marx, k, roly, karl, marx, kolumbusz, krist, f, christopher, columbus, the, last, of, these, is, also, translated, in, english, from, the, original, italian, or, possibly, ligurian, some, native, speakers, disapprove, of, this, usage, the, names, of, certain, historical, religious, personalities, including, popes, however, are, always, hungarianised, by, practically, all, speakers, such, as, luther, m, rton, martin, luther, husz, j, nos, jan, hus, k, lvin, j, nos, john, calvin, just, like, the, names, of, monarchs, for, example, the, king, of, spain, juan, carlos, i, is, referred, to, as, i, j, nos, k, roly, or, the, late, queen, of, the, uk, elizabeth, ii, would, be, referred, to, as, ii, erzs, bet, japanese, names, which, are, usually, written, in, western, order, in, the, rest, of, europe, retain, their, original, order, in, hungarian, e, g, kuroszava, akira, instead, of, akira, kurosawa, as, in, japanese, chinese, and, korean, the, hungarian, convention, for, date, and, time, is, to, go, from, the, general, to, the, specific, starting, with, the, year, first, then, month, then, day, although, address, formatting, is, increasingly, being, influenced, by, standard, european, conventions, the, traditional, hungarian, style, is, 1052, budapest, de, k, ferenc, t, r, 1, so, the, order, is, 1, postcode, 2, settlement, most, general, 3, street, square, etc, more, specific, 4, house, number, most, specific, the, house, number, may, be, followed, by, the, storey, and, door, numbers, addresses, on, envelopes, and, postal, parcels, should, be, formatted, and, placed, on, the, right, side, as, follows, name, of, the, recipient, settlement, street, address, up, to, door, number, if, necessary, hu, postcode, the, hu, part, before, the, postcode, is, only, for, incoming, postal, traffic, from, foreign, countries, note, the, stress, is, always, placed, on, the, first, syllable, of, each, word, the, remaining, syllables, all, receive, an, equal, lesser, stress, all, syllables, are, pronounced, clearly, and, evenly, even, at, the, end, of, a, sentence, unlike, in, english, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, hungarian, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, english, source, wiktionary, source, wiktionary, source, wiktionary
