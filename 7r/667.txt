a, head, of, state, or, chief, of, state, is, the, public, persona, of, a, state, or, sovereign, state, the, specific, naming, of, the, head, of, state, depends, on, the, country, s, form, of, government, and, separation, of, powers, the, head, of, state, may, be, a, ceremonial, figurehead, or, concurrently, the, head, of, government, and, more, in, a, parliamentary, system, such, as, india, or, the, united, kingdom, the, head, of, state, usually, has, mostly, ceremonial, powers, with, a, separate, head, of, government, however, in, some, parliamentary, systems, like, south, africa, there, is, an, executive, president, that, is, both, head, of, state, and, head, of, government, likewise, in, some, parliamentary, systems, the, head, of, state, is, not, the, head, of, government, but, still, has, significant, powers, for, example, morocco, in, contrast, a, semi, presidential, system, such, as, france, has, both, heads, of, state, and, government, as, the, de, facto, leaders, of, the, nation, in, practice, they, divide, the, leadership, of, the, nation, between, themselves, meanwhile, in, presidential, systems, the, head, of, state, is, also, the, head, of, government, in, one, party, ruling, communist, states, the, position, of, president, has, no, tangible, powers, by, itself, however, since, such, a, head, of, state, as, a, matter, of, custom, simultaneously, holds, the, post, of, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, they, are, the, executive, leader, with, their, powers, deriving, from, their, status, of, being, the, party, leader, rather, than, the, office, of, president, former, french, president, charles, de, gaulle, while, developing, the, current, constitution, of, france, 1958, said, that, the, head, of, state, should, embody, l, esprit, de, la, nation, the, spirit, of, the, nation, some, academic, writers, discuss, states, and, governments, in, terms, of, models, an, independent, nation, state, normally, has, a, head, of, state, and, determines, the, extent, of, its, head, s, executive, powers, of, government, or, formal, representational, functions, in, terms, of, protocol, the, head, of, a, sovereign, independent, state, is, usually, identified, as, the, person, who, according, to, that, state, s, constitution, is, the, reigning, monarch, in, the, case, of, a, monarchy, or, the, president, in, the, case, of, a, republic, among, the, state, constitutions, fundamental, laws, that, establish, different, political, systems, four, major, types, of, heads, of, state, can, be, distinguished, in, a, federal, constituent, or, a, dependent, territory, the, same, role, is, fulfilled, by, the, holder, of, an, office, corresponding, to, that, of, a, head, of, state, for, example, in, each, canadian, province, the, role, is, fulfilled, by, the, lieutenant, governor, whereas, in, most, british, overseas, territories, the, powers, and, duties, are, performed, by, the, governor, the, same, applies, to, australian, states, indian, states, etc, hong, kong, s, constitutional, document, the, basic, law, for, example, specifies, the, chief, executive, as, the, head, of, the, special, administrative, region, in, addition, to, their, role, as, the, head, of, government, these, non, sovereign, state, heads, nevertheless, have, limited, or, no, role, in, diplomatic, affairs, depending, on, the, status, and, the, norms, and, practices, of, the, territories, concerned, in, parliamentary, systems, the, head, of, state, may, be, merely, the, nominal, chief, executive, officer, heading, the, executive, branch, of, the, state, and, possessing, limited, executive, power, in, reality, however, following, a, process, of, constitutional, evolution, powers, are, usually, only, exercised, by, direction, of, a, cabinet, presided, over, by, a, head, of, government, who, is, answerable, to, the, legislature, this, accountability, and, legitimacy, requires, that, someone, be, chosen, who, has, a, majority, support, in, the, legislature, or, at, least, not, a, majority, opposition, a, subtle, but, important, difference, it, also, gives, the, legislature, the, right, to, vote, down, the, head, of, government, and, their, cabinet, forcing, it, either, to, resign, or, seek, a, parliamentary, dissolution, the, executive, branch, is, thus, said, to, be, responsible, or, answerable, to, the, legislature, with, the, head, of, government, and, cabinet, in, turn, accepting, constitutional, responsibility, for, offering, constitutional, advice, to, the, head, of, state, in, parliamentary, constitutional, monarchies, the, legitimacy, of, the, unelected, head, of, state, typically, derives, from, the, tacit, approval, of, the, people, via, the, elected, representatives, accordingly, at, the, time, of, the, glorious, revolution, the, english, parliament, acted, of, its, own, authority, to, name, a, new, king, and, queen, the, joint, monarchs, mary, ii, and, william, iii, likewise, edward, viii, s, abdication, required, the, approval, of, each, of, the, six, independent, realms, of, which, he, was, monarch, in, monarchies, with, a, written, constitution, the, position, of, monarch, is, created, under, the, constitution, and, could, be, abolished, through, a, democratic, procedure, of, constitutional, amendment, in, many, cases, there, are, significant, procedural, hurdles, imposed, on, such, a, procedure, as, in, the, constitution, of, spain, in, republics, with, a, parliamentary, system, such, as, india, germany, austria, italy, and, israel, the, head, of, state, is, usually, titled, president, and, the, principal, functions, of, such, presidents, are, mainly, ceremonial, and, symbolic, as, opposed, to, the, presidents, in, a, presidential, or, semi, presidential, system, in, reality, numerous, variants, exist, to, the, position, of, a, head, of, state, within, a, parliamentary, system, the, older, the, constitution, the, more, constitutional, leeway, tends, to, exist, for, a, head, of, state, to, exercise, greater, powers, over, government, as, many, older, parliamentary, system, constitutions, in, fact, give, heads, of, state, powers, and, functions, akin, to, presidential, or, semi, presidential, systems, in, some, cases, without, containing, reference, to, modern, democratic, principles, of, accountability, to, parliament, or, even, to, modern, governmental, offices, usually, the, king, had, the, power, of, declaring, war, without, previous, consent, of, the, parliament, for, example, under, the, 1848, constitution, of, the, kingdom, of, sardinia, and, then, the, kingdom, of, italy, the, statuto, albertino, the, parliamentary, approval, to, the, government, appointed, by, the, king, was, customary, but, not, required, by, law, so, italy, had, a, de, facto, parliamentary, system, but, a, de, jure, presidential, system, examples, of, heads, of, state, in, parliamentary, systems, using, greater, powers, than, usual, either, because, of, ambiguous, constitutions, or, unprecedented, national, emergencies, include, the, decision, by, king, leopold, iii, of, the, belgians, to, surrender, on, behalf, of, his, state, to, the, invading, german, army, in, 1940, against, the, will, of, his, government, judging, that, his, responsibility, to, the, nation, by, virtue, of, his, coronation, oath, required, him, to, act, he, believed, that, his, government, s, decision, to, fight, rather, than, surrender, was, mistaken, and, would, damage, belgium, leopold, s, decision, proved, highly, controversial, after, world, war, ii, belgium, voted, in, a, referendum, to, allow, him, to, resume, his, monarchical, powers, and, duties, but, because, of, the, ongoing, controversy, he, ultimately, abdicated, the, belgian, constitutional, crisis, in, 1990, when, the, head, of, state, refused, to, sign, into, law, a, bill, permitting, abortion, was, resolved, by, the, cabinet, assuming, the, power, to, promulgate, the, law, while, he, was, treated, as, unable, to, reign, for, twenty, four, hours, these, officials, are, excluded, completely, from, the, executive, they, do, not, possess, even, theoretical, executive, powers, or, any, role, even, formal, within, the, government, hence, their, states, governments, are, not, referred, to, by, the, traditional, parliamentary, model, head, of, state, styles, of, his, her, majesty, s, government, or, his, her, excellency, s, government, within, this, general, category, variants, in, terms, of, powers, and, functions, may, exist, the, constitution, of, japan, nihonkoku, kenp, was, drawn, up, under, the, allied, occupation, that, followed, world, war, ii, and, was, intended, to, replace, the, previous, militaristic, and, quasi, absolute, monarchy, system, with, a, form, of, liberal, democracy, parliamentary, system, the, constitution, explicitly, vests, all, executive, power, in, the, cabinet, who, is, chaired, by, the, prime, minister, articles, 65, and, 66, and, responsible, to, the, diet, articles, 67, and, 69, the, emperor, is, defined, in, the, constitution, as, the, symbol, of, the, state, and, of, the, unity, of, the, people, article, 1, and, is, generally, recognised, throughout, the, world, as, the, japanese, head, of, state, although, the, emperor, formally, appoints, the, prime, minister, to, office, article, 6, of, the, constitution, requires, him, to, appoint, the, candidate, as, designated, by, the, diet, without, any, right, to, decline, appointment, he, is, a, ceremonial, figurehead, with, no, independent, discretionary, powers, related, to, the, governance, of, japan, since, the, passage, in, sweden, of, the, 1974, instrument, of, government, the, swedish, monarch, no, longer, has, many, of, the, standard, parliamentary, system, head, of, state, functions, that, had, previously, belonged, to, him, or, her, as, was, the, case, in, the, preceding, 1809, instrument, of, government, today, the, speaker, of, the, riksdag, appoints, following, a, vote, in, the, riksdag, the, prime, minister, and, terminates, their, commission, following, a, vote, of, no, confidence, or, voluntary, resignation, cabinet, members, are, appointed, and, dismissed, at, the, sole, discretion, of, the, prime, minister, laws, and, ordinances, are, promulgated, by, two, cabinet, members, in, unison, signing, on, behalf, of, the, government, and, the, government, not, the, monarch, is, the, high, contracting, party, with, respect, to, international, treaties, the, remaining, official, functions, of, the, sovereign, by, constitutional, mandate, or, by, unwritten, convention, are, to, open, the, annual, session, of, the, riksdag, receive, foreign, ambassadors, and, sign, the, letters, of, credence, for, swedish, ambassadors, chair, the, foreign, advisory, committee, preside, at, the, special, cabinet, council, when, a, new, prime, minister, takes, office, and, to, be, kept, informed, by, the, prime, minister, on, matters, of, state, in, contrast, the, only, contact, the, president, of, ireland, has, with, the, irish, government, is, through, a, formal, briefing, session, given, by, the, taoiseach, head, of, government, to, the, president, however, the, president, has, no, access, to, documentation, and, all, access, to, ministers, goes, through, the, department, of, the, taoiseach, the, president, does, however, hold, limited, reserve, powers, such, as, referring, a, bill, to, the, supreme, court, to, test, its, constitutionality, which, are, used, under, the, president, s, discretion, the, most, extreme, non, executive, republican, head, of, state, is, the, president, of, israel, which, holds, no, reserve, powers, whatsoever, the, least, ceremonial, powers, held, by, the, president, are, to, provide, a, mandate, to, attempt, to, form, a, government, to, approve, the, dissolution, of, the, knesset, made, by, the, prime, minister, and, to, pardon, criminals, or, to, commute, their, sentence, some, parliamentary, republics, like, south, africa, botswana, and, kiribati, have, fused, the, roles, of, the, head, of, state, with, the, head, of, government, like, in, a, presidential, system, while, having, the, sole, executive, officer, often, called, a, president, being, dependent, on, the, parliament, s, confidence, to, rule, like, in, a, parliamentary, system, while, also, being, the, leading, symbol, of, the, nation, the, president, in, this, system, acts, mostly, as, a, prime, minister, since, the, incumbent, must, be, a, member, of, the, legislature, at, the, time, of, the, election, answer, question, sessions, in, parliament, avoid, motions, of, no, confidence, etc, semi, presidential, systems, combine, features, of, presidential, and, parliamentary, systems, notably, in, the, president, parliamentary, subtype, a, requirement, that, the, government, be, answerable, to, both, the, president, and, the, legislature, the, constitution, of, the, fifth, french, republic, provides, for, a, prime, minister, who, is, chosen, by, the, president, but, who, nevertheless, must, be, able, to, gain, support, in, the, national, assembly, should, a, president, be, of, one, side, of, the, political, spectrum, and, the, opposition, be, in, control, of, the, legislature, the, president, is, usually, obliged, to, select, someone, from, the, opposition, to, become, prime, minister, a, process, known, as, cohabitation, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, a, socialist, for, example, was, forced, to, cohabit, with, the, neo, gaullist, right, wing, jacques, chirac, who, became, his, prime, minister, from, 1986, to, 1988, in, the, french, system, in, the, event, of, cohabitation, the, president, is, often, allowed, to, set, the, policy, agenda, in, security, and, foreign, affairs, and, the, prime, minister, runs, the, domestic, and, economic, agenda, other, countries, evolve, into, something, akin, to, a, semi, presidential, system, or, indeed, a, full, presidential, system, weimar, germany, for, example, in, its, constitution, provided, for, a, popularly, elected, president, with, theoretically, dominant, executive, powers, that, were, intended, to, be, exercised, only, in, emergencies, and, a, cabinet, appointed, by, him, from, the, reichstag, which, was, expected, in, normal, circumstances, to, be, answerable, to, the, reichstag, initially, the, president, was, merely, a, symbolic, figure, with, the, reichstag, dominant, however, persistent, political, instability, in, which, governments, often, lasted, only, a, few, months, led, to, a, change, in, the, power, structure, of, the, republic, with, the, president, s, emergency, powers, called, increasingly, into, use, to, prop, up, governments, challenged, by, critical, or, even, hostile, reichstag, votes, by, 1932, power, had, shifted, to, such, an, extent, that, the, german, president, paul, von, hindenburg, was, able, to, dismiss, a, chancellor, and, select, his, own, person, for, the, job, even, though, the, outgoing, chancellor, possessed, the, confidence, of, the, reichstag, while, the, new, chancellor, did, not, subsequently, president, von, hindenburg, used, his, power, to, appoint, adolf, hitler, as, chancellor, without, consulting, the, reichstag, note, the, head, of, state, in, a, presidential, system, may, not, actually, hold, the, title, of, president, the, name, of, the, system, refers, to, any, head, of, state, who, actually, governs, and, is, not, directly, dependent, on, the, legislature, to, remain, in, office, some, constitutions, or, fundamental, laws, provide, for, a, head, of, state, who, is, not, only, in, theory, but, in, practice, chief, executive, operating, separately, from, and, independent, from, the, legislature, this, system, is, known, as, a, presidential, system, and, sometimes, called, the, imperial, model, because, the, executive, officials, of, the, government, are, answerable, solely, and, exclusively, to, a, presiding, acting, head, of, state, and, is, selected, by, and, on, occasion, dismissed, by, the, head, of, state, without, reference, to, the, legislature, it, is, notable, that, some, presidential, systems, while, not, providing, for, collective, executive, accountability, to, the, legislature, may, require, legislative, approval, for, individuals, prior, to, their, assumption, of, cabinet, office, and, empower, the, legislature, to, remove, a, president, from, office, for, example, in, the, united, states, of, america, in, this, case, the, debate, centers, on, confirming, them, into, office, not, removing, them, from, office, and, does, not, involve, the, power, to, reject, or, approve, proposed, cabinet, members, en, bloc, so, accountability, does, not, operate, in, the, same, sense, understood, as, a, parliamentary, system, presidential, systems, are, a, notable, feature, of, constitutions, in, the, americas, including, those, of, argentina, brazil, colombia, el, salvador, mexico, and, venezuela, this, is, generally, attributed, to, the, strong, influence, of, the, united, states, in, the, region, and, as, the, united, states, constitution, served, as, an, inspiration, and, model, for, the, latin, american, wars, of, independence, of, the, early, 19th, century, most, presidents, in, such, countries, are, selected, by, democratic, means, popular, direct, or, indirect, election, however, like, all, other, systems, the, presidential, model, also, encompasses, people, who, become, head, of, state, by, other, means, notably, through, military, dictatorship, or, coup, d, tat, as, often, seen, in, latin, american, middle, eastern, and, other, presidential, regimes, some, of, the, characteristics, of, a, presidential, system, such, as, a, strong, dominant, political, figure, with, an, executive, answerable, to, them, not, the, legislature, can, also, be, found, among, absolute, monarchies, parliamentary, monarchies, and, single, party, e, g, communist, regimes, but, in, most, cases, of, dictatorship, their, stated, constitutional, models, are, applied, in, name, only, and, not, in, political, theory, or, practice, in, certain, states, under, marxist, leninist, constitutions, of, the, constitutionally, socialist, state, type, inspired, by, the, former, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, ussr, and, its, constitutive, soviet, republics, real, political, power, belonged, to, the, sole, legal, party, in, these, states, there, was, no, formal, office, of, head, of, state, but, rather, the, leader, of, the, legislative, branch, was, considered, to, be, the, closest, common, equivalent, of, a, head, of, state, as, a, natural, person, in, the, soviet, union, this, position, carried, such, titles, as, chairman, of, the, central, executive, committee, of, the, ussr, chairman, of, the, presidium, of, the, supreme, soviet, and, in, the, case, of, the, soviet, russia, chairman, of, the, central, executive, committee, of, the, all, russian, congress, of, soviets, pre, 1922, and, chairman, of, the, bureau, of, the, central, committee, of, the, russian, sfsr, 1956, 1966, this, position, may, or, may, not, have, been, held, by, the, de, facto, soviet, leader, at, the, moment, for, example, nikita, khrushchev, never, headed, the, supreme, soviet, but, was, first, secretary, of, the, central, committee, of, the, communist, party, party, leader, and, chairman, of, the, council, of, ministers, head, of, government, this, may, even, lead, to, an, institutional, variability, as, in, north, korea, where, after, the, presidency, of, party, leader, kim, il, sung, the, office, was, vacant, for, years, the, late, president, was, granted, the, posthumous, title, akin, to, some, ancient, far, eastern, traditions, to, give, posthumous, names, and, titles, to, royalty, of, eternal, president, all, substantive, power, as, party, leader, itself, not, formally, created, for, four, years, was, inherited, by, his, son, kim, jong, il, the, post, of, president, was, formally, replaced, on, 5, september, 1998, for, ceremonial, purposes, by, the, office, of, president, of, the, presidium, of, the, supreme, people, s, assembly, while, the, party, leader, s, post, as, chairman, of, the, national, defense, commission, was, simultaneously, declared, the, highest, post, of, the, state, not, unlike, deng, xiaoping, earlier, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, china, under, the, current, country, s, constitution, the, chinese, president, is, a, largely, ceremonial, office, with, limited, power, however, since, 1993, as, a, matter, of, convention, the, presidency, has, been, held, simultaneously, by, the, general, secretary, of, the, chinese, communist, party, the, top, leader, in, the, one, party, system, the, presidency, is, officially, regarded, as, an, institution, of, the, state, rather, than, an, administrative, post, theoretically, the, president, serves, at, the, pleasure, of, the, national, people, s, congress, the, legislature, and, is, not, legally, vested, to, take, executive, action, on, its, own, prerogative, while, clear, categories, do, exist, it, is, sometimes, difficult, to, choose, which, category, some, individual, heads, of, state, belong, to, in, reality, the, category, to, which, each, head, of, state, belongs, is, assessed, not, by, theory, but, by, practice, constitutional, change, in, liechtenstein, in, 2003, gave, its, head, of, state, the, reigning, prince, constitutional, powers, that, included, a, veto, over, legislation, and, power, to, dismiss, the, head, of, government, and, cabinet, it, could, be, argued, that, the, strengthening, of, the, prince, s, powers, vis, a, vis, the, landtag, legislature, has, moved, liechtenstein, into, the, semi, presidential, category, similarly, the, original, powers, given, to, the, greek, president, under, the, 1974, hellenic, republic, constitution, moved, greece, closer, to, the, french, semi, presidential, model, another, complication, exists, with, south, africa, in, which, the, president, is, in, fact, elected, by, the, national, assembly, legislature, and, is, thus, similar, in, principle, to, a, head, of, government, in, a, parliamentary, system, but, is, also, in, addition, recognised, as, the, head, of, state, the, offices, of, president, of, nauru, and, president, of, botswana, are, similar, in, this, respect, to, the, south, african, presidency, panama, during, the, military, dictatorships, of, omar, torrijos, and, manuel, noriega, was, nominally, a, presidential, republic, however, the, elected, civilian, presidents, were, effectively, figureheads, with, real, political, power, being, exercised, by, the, chief, of, the, panamanian, defense, forces, historically, at, the, time, of, the, league, of, nations, 1920, 1946, and, the, founding, of, the, united, nations, 1945, india, s, head, of, state, was, the, monarch, of, the, united, kingdom, ruling, directly, or, indirectly, as, emperor, of, india, through, the, viceroy, and, governor, general, of, india, head, of, state, is, the, highest, ranking, constitutional, position, in, a, sovereign, state, a, head, of, state, has, some, or, all, of, the, roles, listed, below, often, depending, on, the, constitutional, category, above, and, does, not, necessarily, regularly, exercise, the, most, power, or, influence, of, governance, there, is, usually, a, formal, public, ceremony, when, a, person, becomes, head, of, state, or, some, time, after, this, may, be, the, swearing, in, at, the, inauguration, of, a, president, of, a, republic, or, the, coronation, of, a, monarch, one, of, the, most, important, roles, of, the, modern, head, of, state, is, being, a, living, national, symbol, of, the, state, in, hereditary, monarchies, this, extends, to, the, monarch, being, a, symbol, of, the, unbroken, continuity, of, the, state, for, instance, the, canadian, monarch, is, described, by, the, government, as, being, the, personification, of, the, canadian, state, and, is, described, by, the, department, of, canadian, heritage, as, the, personal, symbol, of, allegiance, unity, and, authority, for, all, canadians, in, many, countries, official, portraits, of, the, head, of, state, can, be, found, in, government, offices, courts, of, law, or, other, public, buildings, the, idea, sometimes, regulated, by, law, is, to, use, these, portraits, to, make, the, public, aware, of, the, symbolic, connection, to, the, government, a, practice, that, dates, back, to, medieval, times, sometimes, this, practice, is, taken, to, excess, and, the, head, of, state, becomes, the, principal, symbol, of, the, nation, resulting, in, the, emergence, of, a, personality, cult, where, the, image, of, the, head, of, state, is, the, only, visual, representation, of, the, country, surpassing, other, symbols, such, as, the, flag, other, common, representations, are, on, coins, postage, and, other, stamps, and, banknotes, sometimes, by, no, more, than, a, mention, or, signature, and, public, places, streets, monuments, and, institutions, such, as, schools, are, named, for, current, or, previous, heads, of, state, in, monarchies, e, g, belgium, there, can, even, be, a, practice, to, attribute, the, adjective, royal, on, demand, based, on, existence, for, a, given, number, of, years, however, such, political, techniques, can, also, be, used, by, leaders, without, the, formal, rank, of, head, of, state, even, party, and, other, revolutionary, leaders, without, formal, state, mandate, heads, of, state, often, greet, important, foreign, visitors, particularly, visiting, heads, of, state, they, assume, a, host, role, during, a, state, visit, and, the, programme, may, feature, playing, of, the, national, anthems, by, a, military, band, inspection, of, military, troops, official, exchange, of, gifts, and, attending, a, state, dinner, at, the, official, residence, of, the, host, at, home, heads, of, state, are, expected, to, render, lustre, to, various, occasions, by, their, presence, such, as, by, attending, artistic, or, sports, performances, or, competitions, often, in, a, theatrical, honour, box, on, a, platform, on, the, front, row, at, the, honours, table, expositions, national, day, celebrations, dedication, events, military, parades, and, war, remembrances, prominent, funerals, visiting, different, parts, of, the, country, and, people, from, different, walks, of, life, and, at, times, performing, symbolic, acts, such, as, cutting, a, ribbon, groundbreaking, ship, christening, laying, the, first, stone, some, parts, of, national, life, receive, their, regular, attention, often, on, an, annual, basis, or, even, in, the, form, of, official, patronage, the, olympic, charter, rule, 55, 3, of, the, international, olympic, committee, states, that, the, olympic, summer, and, winter, games, shall, be, opened, by, the, head, of, state, of, the, host, nation, by, uttering, a, single, formulaic, phrase, as, determined, by, the, charter, as, such, invitations, may, be, very, numerous, such, duties, are, often, in, part, delegated, to, such, persons, as, a, spouse, a, head, of, government, or, a, cabinet, minister, or, in, other, cases, possibly, as, a, message, for, instance, to, distance, themselves, without, rendering, offence, just, a, military, officer, or, civil, servant, for, non, executive, heads, of, state, there, is, often, a, degree, of, censorship, by, the, politically, responsible, government, such, as, the, head, of, government, this, means, that, the, government, discreetly, approves, agenda, and, speeches, especially, where, the, constitution, or, customary, law, assumes, all, political, responsibility, by, granting, the, crown, inviolability, in, fact, also, imposing, political, emasculation, as, in, the, kingdom, of, belgium, from, its, very, beginning, in, a, monarchy, this, may, even, be, extended, to, some, degree, to, other, members, of, the, dynasty, especially, the, heir, to, the, throne, below, follows, a, list, of, examples, from, different, countries, of, general, provisions, in, law, which, either, designate, an, office, as, head, of, state, or, define, its, general, purpose, in, the, majority, of, states, whether, republics, or, monarchies, executive, authority, is, vested, at, least, notionally, in, the, head, of, state, in, presidential, systems, the, head, of, state, is, the, actual, de, facto, chief, executive, officer, under, parliamentary, systems, the, executive, authority, is, exercised, by, the, head, of, state, but, in, practice, is, done, so, on, the, advice, of, the, cabinet, of, ministers, this, produces, such, terms, as, her, majesty, s, government, and, his, excellency, s, government, examples, of, parliamentary, systems, in, which, the, head, of, state, is, notional, chief, executive, include, australia, austria, canada, denmark, india, italy, norway, spain, and, the, united, kingdom, the, few, exceptions, where, the, head, of, state, is, not, even, the, nominal, chief, executive, and, where, supreme, executive, authority, is, according, to, the, constitution, explicitly, vested, in, a, cabinet, include, the, czech, republic, ireland, israel, japan, and, sweden, the, head, of, state, usually, appoints, most, or, all, the, key, officials, in, the, government, including, the, head, of, government, and, other, cabinet, ministers, key, judicial, figures, and, all, major, office, holders, in, the, civil, service, foreign, service, and, commissioned, officers, in, the, military, in, many, parliamentary, systems, the, head, of, government, is, appointed, with, the, consent, in, practice, often, decisive, of, the, legislature, and, other, figures, are, appointed, on, the, head, of, government, s, advice, in, practice, these, decisions, are, often, a, formality, the, last, time, the, prime, minister, of, the, united, kingdom, was, unilaterally, selected, by, the, monarch, was, in, 1963, when, queen, elizabeth, ii, appointed, alec, douglas, home, on, the, advice, of, outgoing, prime, minister, harold, macmillan, in, presidential, systems, such, as, that, of, the, united, states, appointments, are, nominated, by, the, president, s, sole, discretion, but, this, nomination, is, often, subject, to, confirmation, by, the, legislature, and, specifically, in, the, us, the, senate, has, to, approve, senior, executive, branch, and, judicial, appointments, by, a, simple, majority, vote, the, head, of, state, may, also, dismiss, office, holders, there, are, many, variants, on, how, this, can, be, done, for, example, members, of, the, irish, cabinet, are, dismissed, by, the, president, on, the, advice, of, the, taoiseach, in, other, instances, the, head, of, state, may, be, able, to, dismiss, an, office, holder, unilaterally, other, heads, of, state, or, their, representatives, have, the, theoretical, power, to, dismiss, any, office, holder, while, it, is, exceptionally, rarely, used, in, france, while, the, president, cannot, force, the, prime, minister, to, tender, the, resignation, of, the, government, he, can, in, practice, request, it, if, the, prime, minister, is, from, his, own, majority, in, presidential, systems, the, president, often, has, the, power, to, fire, ministers, at, his, sole, discretion, in, the, united, states, the, unwritten, convention, calls, for, the, heads, of, the, executive, departments, to, resign, on, their, own, initiative, when, called, to, do, so, some, countries, have, alternative, provisions, for, senior, appointments, in, sweden, under, the, instrument, of, government, of, 1974, the, speaker, of, the, riksdag, has, the, role, of, formally, appointing, the, prime, minister, following, a, vote, in, the, riksdag, and, the, prime, minister, in, turn, appoints, and, dismisses, cabinet, ministers, at, his, her, sole, discretion, although, many, constitutions, particularly, from, the, 19th, century, and, earlier, make, no, explicit, mention, of, a, head, of, state, in, the, generic, sense, of, several, present, day, international, treaties, the, officeholders, corresponding, to, this, position, are, recognised, as, such, by, other, countries, in, a, monarchy, the, monarch, is, generally, understood, to, be, the, head, of, state, the, vienna, convention, on, diplomatic, relations, which, codified, longstanding, custom, operates, under, the, presumption, that, the, head, of, a, diplomatic, mission, i, e, ambassador, or, nuncio, of, the, sending, state, is, accredited, to, the, head, of, state, of, the, receiving, state, the, head, of, state, accredits, i, e, formally, validates, their, country, s, ambassadors, or, rarer, equivalent, diplomatic, mission, chiefs, such, as, high, commissioner, or, papal, nuncio, through, sending, formal, a, letter, of, credence, and, a, letter, of, recall, at, the, end, of, a, tenure, to, other, heads, of, state, and, conversely, receives, the, letters, of, their, foreign, counterparts, without, that, accreditation, the, chief, of, the, diplomatic, mission, cannot, take, up, their, role, and, receive, the, highest, diplomatic, status, the, role, of, a, head, of, state, in, this, regard, is, codified, in, the, vienna, convention, on, diplomatic, relations, from, 1961, which, as, of, 2017, 191, sovereign, states, has, ratified, however, there, are, provisions, in, the, vienna, convention, that, a, diplomatic, agent, of, lesser, rank, such, as, a, charg, d, affaires, is, accredited, to, the, minister, of, foreign, affairs, or, equivalent, the, head, of, state, is, often, designated, the, high, contracting, party, in, international, treaties, on, behalf, of, the, state, signs, them, either, personally, or, has, them, signed, in, his, her, name, by, ministers, government, members, or, diplomats, subsequent, ratification, when, necessary, may, rest, with, the, legislature, the, treaties, constituting, the, european, union, and, the, european, communities, are, noteworthy, contemporary, cases, of, multilateral, treaties, cast, in, this, traditional, format, as, are, the, accession, agreements, of, new, member, states, however, rather, than, being, invariably, concluded, between, two, heads, of, state, it, has, become, common, that, bilateral, treaties, are, in, present, times, cast, in, an, intergovernmental, format, e, g, between, the, government, of, x, and, the, government, of, y, rather, than, between, his, majesty, the, king, of, x, and, his, excellency, the, president, of, y, in, canada, these, head, of, state, powers, belong, to, the, monarch, as, part, of, the, royal, prerogative, but, the, governor, general, has, been, permitted, to, exercise, them, since, 1947, and, has, done, so, since, the, 1970s, a, head, of, state, is, often, by, virtue, of, holding, the, highest, executive, powers, explicitly, designated, as, the, commander, in, chief, of, that, nation, s, armed, forces, holding, the, highest, office, in, all, military, chains, of, command, in, a, constitutional, monarchy, or, non, executive, presidency, the, head, of, state, may, de, jure, hold, ultimate, authority, over, the, armed, forces, but, will, only, normally, as, per, either, written, law, or, unwritten, convention, exercise, their, authority, on, the, advice, of, their, responsible, ministers, meaning, that, the, de, facto, ultimate, decision, making, on, military, manoeuvres, is, made, elsewhere, the, head, of, state, will, regardless, of, actual, authority, perform, ceremonial, duties, related, to, the, country, s, armed, forces, and, will, sometimes, appear, in, military, uniform, for, these, purposes, particularly, in, monarchies, where, also, the, monarch, s, consort, and, other, members, of, a, royal, family, may, also, appear, in, military, garb, this, is, generally, the, only, time, a, head, of, state, of, a, stable, democratic, country, will, appear, dressed, in, such, a, manner, as, statesmen, and, public, are, eager, to, assert, the, primacy, of, civilian, elected, politics, over, the, armed, forces, in, military, dictatorships, or, governments, which, have, arisen, from, coups, d, tat, the, position, of, commander, in, chief, is, obvious, as, all, authority, in, such, a, government, derives, from, the, application, of, military, force, occasionally, a, power, vacuum, created, by, war, is, filled, by, a, head, of, state, stepping, beyond, the, normal, constitutional, role, as, king, albert, i, of, belgium, did, during, world, war, i, in, these, and, in, revolutionary, regimes, the, head, of, state, and, often, executive, ministers, whose, offices, are, legally, civilian, will, frequently, appear, in, military, uniform, some, countries, with, a, parliamentary, system, designate, officials, other, than, the, head, of, state, with, command, in, chief, powers, the, armed, forces, of, the, communist, states, are, under, the, absolute, control, of, the, communist, party, it, is, usual, that, the, head, of, state, particularly, in, parliamentary, systems, as, part, of, the, symbolic, role, is, the, one, who, opens, the, annual, sessions, of, the, legislature, e, g, the, annual, state, opening, of, parliament, with, the, speech, from, the, throne, in, britain, even, in, presidential, systems, the, head, of, state, often, formally, reports, to, the, legislature, on, the, present, national, status, e, g, the, state, of, the, union, address, in, the, united, states, of, america, or, the, state, of, the, nation, address, in, south, africa, most, countries, require, that, all, bills, passed, by, the, house, or, houses, of, the, legislature, be, signed, into, law, by, the, head, of, state, in, some, states, such, as, the, united, kingdom, belgium, and, ireland, the, head, of, state, is, in, fact, formally, considered, a, tier, of, the, legislature, however, in, most, parliamentary, systems, the, head, of, state, cannot, refuse, to, sign, a, bill, and, in, granting, a, bill, their, assent, indicate, that, it, was, passed, in, accordance, with, the, correct, procedures, the, signing, of, a, bill, into, law, is, formally, known, as, promulgation, some, monarchical, states, call, this, procedure, royal, assent, in, some, parliamentary, systems, the, head, of, state, retains, certain, discretionary, powers, in, relation, to, bills, to, be, exercised, they, may, have, authority, to, veto, a, bill, until, the, houses, of, the, legislature, have, reconsidered, it, and, approved, it, a, second, time, reserve, a, bill, to, be, signed, later, or, suspend, it, indefinitely, generally, in, states, with, royal, prerogative, this, power, is, rarely, used, refer, a, bill, to, the, courts, to, test, its, constitutionality, refer, a, bill, to, the, people, in, a, referendum, if, the, head, of, state, also, serves, as, the, chief, executive, the, head, of, state, can, politically, control, the, necessary, executive, measures, without, which, a, proclaimed, law, can, remain, dead, letter, sometimes, for, years, or, even, forever, a, head, of, state, is, often, empowered, to, summon, and, dissolve, the, country, s, legislature, in, most, parliamentary, systems, this, is, often, done, on, the, advice, of, the, head, of, government, in, some, parliamentary, systems, and, in, some, presidential, systems, however, the, head, of, state, may, do, so, on, their, own, initiative, some, states, have, fixed, term, legislatures, with, no, option, of, bringing, forward, elections, e, g, article, ii, section, 3, of, the, u, s, constitution, in, other, systems, there, are, usually, fixed, terms, but, the, head, of, state, retains, authority, to, dissolve, the, legislature, in, certain, circumstances, where, a, head, of, government, has, lost, support, in, the, legislature, some, heads, of, state, may, refuse, a, dissolution, where, one, is, requested, thereby, forcing, the, head, of, government, s, resignation, in, a, republic, the, head, of, state, nowadays, usually, bears, the, title, of, president, but, some, have, or, have, had, other, titles, titles, commonly, used, by, monarchs, are, king, queen, or, emperor, empress, but, also, many, other, e, g, grand, duke, prince, emir, and, sultan, though, president, and, various, monarchical, titles, are, most, commonly, used, for, heads, of, state, in, some, nationalistic, regimes, the, leader, adopts, formally, or, de, facto, a, unique, style, simply, meaning, leader, in, the, national, language, e, g, germany, s, single, national, socialist, party, chief, and, combined, head, of, state, and, government, adolf, hitler, as, the, f, hrer, between, 1934, and, 1945, in, 1959, when, former, british, crown, colony, singapore, gained, self, government, it, adopted, the, malay, style, yang, di, pertuan, negara, head, of, state, in, malay, for, its, governor, the, actual, head, of, state, remained, the, british, monarch, the, second,

praised, as, paduka, yang, mulia, a, malay, honorific, originally, given, to, kings, sukarno, awarded, himself, titles, in, that, fashion, due, to, his, noble, ancestry, there, are, also, a, few, nations, in, which, the, exact, title, and, definition, of, the, office, of, head, of, state, have, been, vague, during, the, chinese, cultural, revolution, following, the, downfall, of, chinese, president, liu, shaoqi, no, successor, was, named, so, the, duties, of, the, head, of, state, were, transferred, collectively, to, the, vice, presidents, soong, ching, ling, and, dong, biwu, then, to, the, standing, committee, of, the, national, people, s, congress, but, chairman, mao, zedong, was, still, the, paramount, leader, this, situation, was, later, changed, the, president, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, is, now, the, head, of, state, although, the, presidency, is, a, largely, ceremonial, office, with, limited, power, the, symbolic, role, of, a, head, of, state, is, now, generally, performed, by, xi, jinping, who, is, also, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, communist, party, leader, and, chairman, of, the, central, military, commission, supreme, military, command, making, him, the, most, powerful, person, in, china, in, north, korea, the, late, kim, il, sung, was, named, eternal, president, four, years, after, his, death, and, the, presidency, was, abolished, as, a, result, some, of, the, duties, previously, held, by, the, president, were, constitutionally, delegated, to, the, chairman, of, the, standing, committee, of, the, supreme, people, s, assembly, who, performs, some, of, the, roles, of, a, head, of, state, such, as, accrediting, foreign, ambassadors, and, undertaking, overseas, visits, however, the, de, jure, role, of, head, of, state, lies, within, the, president, of, the, state, affairs, commission, currently, kim, jong, un, who, as, the, general, secretary, of, the, workers, party, of, korea, and, supreme, commander, of, the, armed, forces, of, north, korea, is, the, most, powerful, person, in, north, korea, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, samoa, was, an, elective, monarchy, or, an, aristocratic, republic, given, the, comparative, ambiguity, of, the, title, o, le, ao, o, le, malo, and, the, nature, of, the, head, of, state, s, office, in, some, states, the, office, of, head, of, state, is, not, expressed, in, a, specific, title, reflecting, that, role, but, constitutionally, awarded, to, a, post, of, another, formal, nature, colonel, muammar, gaddafi, initially, ruled, as, combined, head, of, state, and, briefly, head, of, government, of, the, libyan, arab, republic, styled, as, chairman, of, the, revolutionary, command, council, in, 1977, the, libyan, jamahiriya, state, of, the, masses, replaced, the, previous, republic, and, in, march, 1979, the, role, of, head, of, state, was, transferred, to, the, secretary, general, of, the, general, people, s, congress, comparable, to, a, speaker, in, practice, however, gaddafi, remained, the, de, facto, leader, as, guide, of, the, revolution, until, his, overthrow, in, 2011, sometimes, a, head, of, state, assumes, office, as, a, state, becomes, legal, and, political, reality, before, a, formal, title, for, the, highest, office, is, determined, thus, in, the, since, 1, january, 1960, independent, republic, cameroon, cameroun, a, former, french, colony, the, first, president, ahmadou, babatoura, ahidjo, was, at, first, not, styled, pr, sident, but, merely, known, as, chef, d, tat, french, for, head, of, state, until, 5, may, 1960, in, uganda, idi, amin, the, military, leader, after, the, coup, of, 25, january, 1971, was, formally, styled, military, head, of, state, till, 21, february, 1971, only, from, then, on, as, regular, but, unconstitutional, unelected, president, in, certain, cases, a, special, style, is, needed, to, accommodate, imperfect, statehood, e, g, the, title, sadr, i, riyasat, was, used, in, kashmir, after, its, accession, to, india, and, the, palestine, liberation, organization, leader, yasser, arafat, was, styled, the, first, president, of, the, palestinian, national, authority, in, 1994, in, 2008, the, same, office, was, restyled, as, president, of, the, state, of, palestine, in, medieval, catholic, europe, it, was, universally, accepted, that, the, pope, ranked, first, among, all, rulers, and, was, followed, by, the, holy, roman, emperor, the, pope, also, had, the, sole, right, to, determine, the, precedence, of, all, others, this, principle, was, first, challenged, by, a, protestant, ruler, gustavus, adolphus, of, sweden, and, was, later, maintained, by, his, country, at, the, congress, of, westphalia, great, britain, would, later, claim, a, break, of, the, old, principle, for, the, quadruple, alliance, in, 1718, however, it, was, not, until, the, 1815, congress, of, vienna, when, it, was, decided, due, to, the, abolition, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1806, and, the, weak, position, of, france, and, other, catholic, states, to, assert, themselves, and, remains, so, to, this, day, that, all, sovereign, states, are, treated, as, equals, whether, monarchies, or, republics, on, occasions, when, multiple, heads, of, state, or, their, representatives, meet, precedence, is, by, the, host, usually, determined, in, alphabetical, order, in, whatever, language, the,

absolutism, and, the, l, etat, c, est, moi, to, that, of, a, constitutional, monarch, parallel, with, the, conceptual, evolution, of, sovereignty, from, merely, the, personal, rule, of, a, single,

the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, in, england, scotland, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, and, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, the, monarchies, who, survived, through, this, era, were, the, ones, who, were, willing, to, subject, themselves, to, constitutional, limitations, whenever, a, head, of, state, is, not, available, for, any, reason, constitutional, provisions, may, allow, the, role, to, fall, temporarily, to, an, assigned, person, or, collective, body, in, a, republic, this, is, depending, on, provisions, outlined, by, the, constitution, or, improvised, a, vice,

such, as, war, occupation, revolution, or, a, coup, d, tat, constitutional, institutions, including, the, symbolically, crucial, head, of, state, may, be, reduced, to, a, figurehead, or, be, suspended, in, favour, of, an, emergency, office, such, as, the, original, roman, dictator, or, eliminated, by, a, new, provisionary, regime, such, as, a, collective, of, the, junta, type, or, removed, by, an, occupying, force, such, as, a, military, governor, an, early, example, being, the, spartan, harmost, in, early, modern, europe, a, single, person, was, often, monarch, simultaneously, of, separate, states, a, composite, monarchy, is, a, retrospective, label, for, those, cases, where, the, states, were, governed, entirely, separately, of, contemporary, terms, a, personal, union, had, less, government, co, ordination, than, a, real, union, one, of, the, two, co, princes, of, andorra, is, the, president, of, france, such, arrangements, are, not, to, be, confused, with,

governor, general, in, canada, is, appointed, by, the, sovereign, usually, on, the, advice, of, the, relevant, prime, minister, although, sometimes, it, is, based, on, the, result, of, a, vote, in, the, relevant, parliament, which, is, the, case, for, papua, new, guinea, and, the, solomon, islands, as, a, representative, and, to, exercise, almost, all, the, royal, prerogative, according, to, established, constitutional, authority, in, australia, the, present, king, is, generally, assumed, to, be, head, of, state, since, the, governor, general, and, the, state, governors, are, defined, as, his, representatives, however, since, the, governor, general, performs, almost, all, national, regal, functions, the, governor, general, has, occasionally, been, referred, to, as, head, of, state, in, political, and, media, discussion, to, a, lesser, extent, uncertainty, has, been, expressed, in, canada, as, to, which, officeholder, the, monarch, the, governor, general, or, both, can, be, considered, the, head, of, state, new, zealand, papua, new, guinea, and, tuvalu, explicitly, name, the, monarch, as, their, head, of, state, though, tuvalu, s, constitution, states, that, references, in, any, law, to, the, head, of, state, shall, be, read, as, including, a, reference, to, the, governor, general, governors, general, are, frequently, treated, as, heads, of, state, on, state, and,

constitutional, convention, by, acting, unilaterally, that, is, without, direction, from, ministers, parliament, or, the, monarch, occurred, in, 1926, when, canada, s, governor, general, refused, the, head, of, government, s, formal, advice, requesting, a, dissolution, of, parliament, and, a, general, election, in, a, letter, informing, the, monarch, after, the, event, the, governor, general, said, i, have, to, await, the, verdict, of, history, to, prove, my, having, adopted, a, wrong, course, and, this, i, do, with, an, easy, conscience, that, right, or, wrong, i, have, acted, in, the, interests, of, canada, and, implicated, no, one, else, in, my, decision, another, example, occurred, when, in, the, 1975, australian, constitutional, crisis, the, governor, general, unexpectedly, dismissed, the, prime, minister, in, order, to, break, a, stalemate, between, the, house, of, representatives, and, senate, over, money, bills, the, governor, general, issued, a, public, statement, saying, he, felt, it, was, the, only, solution, consistent, with, the, constitution, his, oath, of, office, and, his, responsibilities, authority, and, duty, as, governor, general, a, letter, from, the, queen, s, private, secretary, at, the, time, martin, charteris, confirmed, that, the, only, person, competent, to, commission, an, australian, prime, minister, was, the, governor, general, and, it, would, not, be, proper, for, the, monarch, to, personally, intervene, in, matters, that, the, constitution, act, so, clearly, places, within, the, governor, general, s, jurisdiction, other,

divine, authority, such, as, the, mandate, of, heaven, and, the, divine, right, of, kings, some, monarchs, even, claimed, divine, ancestry, such, as, egyptian, pharaohs, and, sapa, incas, who, claimed, descent, from, their, respective, sun, gods, and, often, sought, to, maintain, this, bloodline, by, practising, incestuous, marriage, in, ancient, rome, during, the, principate, the, title, divus, divine, was, conferred, notably, posthumously, on, the, emperor, a, symbolic, legitimating, element, in, establishing, a, de, facto, dynasty, in, roman, catholicism, the, pope, was, once, sovereign, pontiff, and, head, of, state, first, of, the, politically, important, papal, states, after, italian, unification, the, pope, remains, head, of, state, of, vatican, city, furthermore, the,

of, muhammad, various, political, muslim, leaders, since, have, styled, themselves, caliph, and, served, as, dynastic, heads, of, state, sometimes, in, addition, to, another, title, such, as, the, ottoman, sultan, historically, some, theocratic, islamic, states, known, as, imamates, have, been, led, by, imams, as, head, of, state, such, as, in, what, is, now, oman, yemen, and, saudi, arabia,

of, the, collective, as, the, term, of, office, progresses, of, multiple, royal, systems, a, diarchy, in, which, two, rulers, is, the, constitutional, norm, may, be, distinguished, from, a, coregency, in, which, a, monarchy, experiences, an, exceptional, period, of, multiple, rulers, examples, of, collective, republican, systems, include, nominal, triumvirates, the, french, directory, of, the, 1790s, the, seven, member, swiss, federal, council, where, each, member, acts, in, turn, as, president, for, one, year, the, presidency, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, with, members, from, three, nations, the, two, captains, regent, of, san, marino, which, maintains, the, tradition, of, italian, medieval, republics, that, had, always, had, an, even, number, of, consuls, in, the, roman, republic, there, were, two, heads, of, state, styled, consul, both, of, whom, alternated, months, of, authority, during, their, year, in, office, similarly, there, was, an, even, number, of, supreme, magistrates, in, the, italic, republics, of, ancient, age, in, the, athenian, republic, there, were, nine, supreme, magistrates, styled, archons, in, carthage, there, were, two, supreme, magistrates, styled, kings, or, suffetes, judges, in, ancient, sparta, there, were, two, hereditary, kings, belonging, to, two, dynasties, in, the, soviet, union, the, presidium, of, the, supreme, soviet, between, 1938, and, 1989, served, as, the, collective, head, of, state, after, world, war, ii, the, soviet, model, was, subsequently, adopted, by, almost, all, countries, belonged, to, its, sphere, of, influence, czechoslovakia, remained, the, only, country, among, them, that, retained, an, office, of, president, as, a, form, of, a, single, head, of, state, throughout, this, period, poland, and, hungary, which, initially, had, western, style, constitutions, and, therefore, western, style, presidencies, switched, to, the, presidium, model, with, the, adoption, of, new, soviet, influenced, constitutions, romania, which, was, a, monarchy, before, the, soviet, takeover, was, the, only, country, to, move, to, a, unitary, presidency, from, a, collective, head, of, state, a, move, done, by, dictator, nicolae, ceausescu, in, 1974, a, modern, example, of, a, collective, head, of, state, is, the, sovereignty, council, of, sudan, the, interim, ruling, council, of, sudan, the, sovereignty, council, comprises, 11, ministers, who, together, have, exercised, all, governmental, functions, for, sudan, since, the, fall, of, president, omar, al, bashir, decisions, are, made, either, by, consensus, or, by, a, super, majority, vote, 8, members, the, national, government, of, the, republic, of, china, established, in, 1928, had, a, panel, of, about, 40, people, as, collective, head, of, state, though, beginning, that, year, a, provisional, constitution, made, the, kuomintang, the, sole, government, party, and, the, national, government, bound, to, the, instructions, of, the, central, executive, committee, of, that, party, the, position, of, head, of, state, can, be, established, in, different, ways, and, with, different, sources, of, legitimacy, power, can, come, from, force, but, formal, legitimacy, is, often, established, even, if, only, by, fictitious, claims, of, continuity, e, g, a, forged, claim, of, descent, from, a, previous, dynasty, there, have, been, cases, of, sovereignty, granted, by, deliberate, act, even, when, accompanied, by, orders, of, succession, as, may, be, the, case, in, a, dynastic, split, such, grants, of, sovereignty, are, usually, forced, as, is, common, with, self, determination, granted, after, nationalist, revolts, this, occurred, with, the, last, attalid, king, of, hellenistic, pergamon, who, by, testament, left, his, realm, to, rome, to, avoid, a, disastrous, conquest, under, a, theocracy, perceived, divine, status, translated, into, earthly, authority, under, divine, law, this, can, take, the, form, of, supreme, divine, authority, above, the, state, s, granting, a, tool, for, political, influence, to, a, priesthood, in, this, way, the, amun, priesthood, reversed, the, reforms, of, pharaoh, akhenaten, after, his, death, the, division, of, theocratic, power, can, be, disputed, as, happened, between, the, pope, and, holy, roman, emperor, in, the, investiture, conflict, when, the, temporal, power, sought, to, control, key, clergy, nominations, in, order, to, guarantee, popular, support, and, thereby, his, own, legitimacy, by, incorporating, the, formal, ceremony, of, unction, during, coronation, the, notion, of, a, social, contract, holds, that, the, nation, either, the, whole, people, or, the, electorate, gives, a, mandate, through, acclamation, or, election, individual, heads, of, state, may, acquire, their, position, by, virtue, of, a, constitution, typically, as, a, transitional, measure, as, part, of, establishing, the, new, form, of, government, that, the, constitution, decrees, for, example, transitional, provision, 1, of, the, constitution, of, italy, states, that, once, the, constitution, enters, into, force, the, provisional, head, of, state, would, automatically, become, president, of, italy, under, it, an, extreme, example, of, this, approach, is, seychelles, where, the, 1976, independence, constitution, s, article, 31, stated, that, james, mancham, would, be, the, first, president, of, seychelles, by, name, rather, than, by, the, fact, he, was, the, prime, minister, of, colonial, seychelles, immediately, before, independence, the, position, of, a, monarch, is, usually, hereditary, but, in, constitutional, monarchies, there, are, usually, restrictions, on, the, incumbent, s, exercise, of, powers, and, prohibitions, on, the, possibility, of, choosing, a, successor, by, other, means, than, by, birth, in, a, hereditary, monarchy, the, position, of, monarch, is, inherited, according, to, a, statutory, or, customary, order, of, succession, usually, within, one, royal, family, tracing, its, origin, through, a, historical, dynasty, or, bloodline, this, usually, means, that, the, heir, to, the, throne, is, known, well, in, advance, of, becoming, monarch, to, ensure, a, smooth, succession, however, many, cases, of, uncertain, succession, in, european, history, have, often, led, to, wars, of, succession, primogeniture, in, which, the, eldest, child, of, the, monarch, is, first, in, line, to, become, monarch, is, the, most, common, system, in, hereditary, monarchy, the, order, of, succession, is, usually, affected, by, rules, on, gender, historically, agnatic, primogeniture, or, patrilineal, primogeniture, was, favoured, that, is, inheritance, according, to, seniority, of, birth, among, the, sons, of, a, monarch, or, head, of, family, with, sons, and, their, male, issue, inheriting, before, brothers, and, their, male, issue, to, the, total, exclusion, of, females, and, descendants, through, females, from, succession, this, complete, exclusion, of, females, from, dynastic, succession, is, commonly, referred, to, as, application, of, the, salic, law, another, variation, on, agnatic, primogeniture, was, the, so, called, semi, salic, law, or, agnatic, cognatic, primogeniture, which, allowed, women, to, succeed, only, at, the, extinction, of, all, the, male, descendants, in, the, male, line, of, the, particular, legislator, before, primogeniture, was, enshrined, in, european, law, and, tradition, kings, would, often, secure, the, succession, by, having, their, successor, usually, their, eldest, son, crowned, during, their, own, lifetime, so, for, a, time, there, would, be, two, kings, in, coregency, a, senior, king, and, a, junior, king, examples, include, henry, the, young, king, of, england, and, the, early, direct, capetians, in, france, sometimes, however, primogeniture, can, operate, through, the, female, line, in, some, systems, a, female, may, rule, as, monarch, only, when, the, male, line, dating, back, to, a, common, ancestor, is, exhausted, in, 1980, sweden, by, rewriting, its, 1810, act, of, succession, became, the, first, monarchy, to, declare, equal, full, cognatic, primogeniture, meaning, that, the, eldest, child, of, the, monarch, whether, female, or, male, ascends, to, the, throne, other, european, monarchies, such, as, the, netherlands, in, 1983, norway, in, 1990, and, belgium, in, 1991, have, since, followed, suit, similar, reforms, were, proposed, in, 2011, for, the, united, kingdom, and, the, other, commonwealth, realms, which, came, into, effect, in, 2015, after, having, been, approved, by, all, of, the, affected, nations, sometimes, religion, is, affected, under, the, act, of, settlement, 1701, all, roman, catholics, and, all, persons, who, have, married, roman, catholics, are, ineligible, to, be, the, british, monarch, and, are, skipped, in, the, order, of, succession, in, some, monarchies, there, may, be, liberty, for, the, incumbent, or, some, body, convening, after, the, death, of, the, monarch, to, choose, from, eligible, members, of, the, ruling, house, often, limited, to, legitimate, descendants, of, the, dynasty, s, founder, rules, of, succession, may, be, further, limited, by, state, religion, residency, equal, marriage, or, even, permission, from, the, legislature, other, hereditary, systems, of, succession, included, tanistry, which, is, semi, elective, and, gives, weight, to, merit, and, agnatic, seniority, in, some, monarchies, such, as, saudi, arabia, succession, to, the, throne, usually, first, passes, to, the, monarch, s, next, eldest, brother, and, only, after, that, to, the, monarch, s, children, agnatic, seniority, election, usually, is, the, constitutional, way, to, choose, the, head, of, state, of, a, republic, and, some, monarchies, either, directly, through, popular, election, indirectly, by, members, of, the, legislature, or, of, a, special, college, of, electors, such, as, the, electoral, college, in, the, united, states, or, as, an, exclusive, prerogative, exclusive, prerogative, allows, the, heads, of, states, of, constituent, monarchies, of, a, federation, to, choose, the, head, of, state, for, the, federation, among, themselves, as, in, the, united, arab, emirates, and, malaysia, the, pope, head, of, state, of, vatican, city, is, chosen, by, previously, appointed, cardinals, under, 80, years, of, age, from, among, themselves, in, a, papal, conclave, a, head, of, state, can, be, empowered, to, designate, his, successor, such, as, lord, protector, of, the, commonwealth, oliver, cromwell, who, was, succeeded, by, his, son, richard, a, head, of, state, may, seize, power, by, force, or, revolution, this, is, not, the, same, as, the, use, of, force, to, maintain, power, as, is, practised, by, authoritarian, or, totalitarian, rulers, dictators, often, use, democratic, titles, though, some, proclaim, themselves, monarchs, examples, of, the, latter, include, emperor, napoleon, i, of, france, and, king, zog, of, albania, in, spain, general, francisco, franco, adopted, the, formal, title, jefe, del, estado, or, chief, of, state, and, established, himself, as, regent, for, a, vacant, monarchy, uganda, s, idi, amin, was, one, of, several, who, named, themselves, president, for, life, a, foreign, power, can, establishing, a, branch, of, their, own, dynasty, or, one, friendly, to, their, interests, this, was, often, the, outcome, of, the, wars, fought, between, the, roman, empire, and, the, parthian, empire, over, control, of, armenia, a, vital, buffer, state, between, the, two, realms, the, roman, parthian, war, of, 58, 63, ended, with, a, compromise, a, parthian, prince, of, the, arsacid, line, would, henceforth, sit, on, the, armenian, throne, but, his, nomination, had, to, be, approved, by, the, roman, emperor, apart, from, violent, overthrow, a, head, of, state, s, position, can, be, lost, in, several, ways, including, death, another, by, expiration, of, the, constitutional, term, of, office, abdication, or, resignation, in, some, cases, an, abdication, cannot, occur, unilaterally, but, comes, into, effect, only, when, approved, by, an, act, of, parliament, as, in, the, case, of, british, king, edward, viii, the, post, can, also, be, abolished, by, constitutional, change, in, such, cases, an, incumbent, may, be, allowed, to, finish, their, term, of, course, a, head, of, state, position, will, cease, to, exist, if, the, state, itself, does, heads, of, state, generally, enjoy, widest, inviolability, although, some, states, allow, impeachment, or, a, similar, constitutional, procedure, by, which, the, highest, legislative, or, judicial, authorities, are, empowered, to, revoke, the, head, of, state, s, mandate, on, exceptional, grounds, this, may, be, a, common, crime, a, political, sin, or, an, act, by, which, the, head, of, state, violates, such, provisions, as, an, established, religion, mandatory, for, the, monarch, by, similar, procedure, an, original, mandate, may, be, declared, invalid, effigies, memorials, and, monuments, of, former, heads, of, state, can, be, designed, to, represent, the, history, or, aspirations, of, a, state, or, its, people, such, as, the, equestrian, bronze, sculpture, of, kaiser, wilhelm, i, first, emperor, of, a, unified, germany, erected, in, berlin, at, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, or, the, victoria, memorial, erected, in, front, of, buckingham, palace, london, commemorating, queen, victoria, and, her, reign, 1837, 1901, and, unveiled, in, 1911, by, her, grandson, king, george, v, or, the, monument, placed, in, front, of, the, victoria, memorial, hall, kolkata, calcutta, 1921, commemorating, queen, victoria, s, reign, as, empress, of, india, from, 1876, another, twentieth, century, example, is, the, mount, rushmore, national, memorial, a, group, sculpture, constructed, 1927, 1941, on, a, conspicuous, skyline, in, the, black, hills, of, south, dakota, 40th, state, of, the, union, 1889, in, the, midwestern, united, states, representing, the, territorial, expansion, of, the, united, states, in, the, first, 130, years, from, its, founding, which, is, promoted, as, the, shrine, of, democracy, former, presidents, of, the, united, states, while, holding, no, political, powers, per, se, sometimes, continue, to, exert, influence, in, national, and, world, affairs, a, monarch, may, retain, his, style, and, certain, prerogatives, after, abdication, as, did, king, leopold, iii, of, belgium, who, left, the, throne, to, his, son, after, winning, a, referendum, which, allowed, him, to, retain, a, full, royal, household, deprived, him, of, a, constitutional, or, representative, role, napoleon, transformed, the, italian, principality, of, elba, where, he, was, imprisoned, into, a, miniature, version, of, his, first, empire, with, most, trappings, of, a, sovereign, monarchy, until, his, cent, jours, escape, and, reseizure, of, power, in, france, convinced, his, opponents, reconvening, the, vienna, congress, in, 1815, to, revoke, his, gratuitous, privileges, and, send, him, to, die, in, exile, on, barren, saint, helena, by, tradition, deposed, monarchs, who, have, not, freely, abdicated, continue, to, use, their, monarchical, titles, as, a, courtesy, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, hence, even, after, constantine, ii, ceased, to, be, king, of, the, hellenes, it, is, still, common, to, refer, to, the, deposed, king, and, his, family, as, if, constantine, ii, were, still, on, the, throne, as, many, european, royal, courts, and, households, do, in, guest, lists, at, royal, weddings, as, in, sweden, in, 2010, britain, in, 2011, and, luxembourg, in, 2012, the, current, hellenic, republic, opposes, the, right, of, their, deposed, monarch, and, former, royal, family, members, to, be, referred, to, by, their, former, titles, or, bearing, a, surname, indicating, royal, status, and, has, enacted, legislation, which, hinders, acquisition, of, greek, citizenship, unless, those, terms, are, met, the, former, king, brought, this, issue, along, with, property, ownership, issues, before, the, european, court, of, human, rights, for, alleged, violations, of, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, but, lost, with, respect, to, the, name, issue, however, some, other, states, have, no, problem, with, deposed, monarchs, being, referred, to, by, their, former, title, and, even, allow, them, to, travel, internationally, on, the, state, s, diplomatic, passport, the, italian, constitution, provides, that, a, former, president, of, the, republic, takes, the, title, president, emeritus, of, the, italian, republic, and, he, or, she, is, also, a, senator, for, life, and, enjoys, immunity, flight, status, and, official, residences, certain, privileges
