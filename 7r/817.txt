the, one, child, policy, chinese, pinyin, y, h, i, zh, ngc, was, a, population, planning, initiative, in, china, implemented, between, 1979, and, 2015, to, curb, the, country, s, population, growth, by, restricting, many, families, to, a, single, child, the, program, had, wide, ranging, social, cultural, economic, and, demographic, effects, although, the, contribution, of, one, child, restrictions, to, the, broader, program, has, been, the, subject, of, controversy, its, efficacy, in, reducing, birth, rates, and, defensibility, from, a, human, rights, perspective, have, been, subjects, of, controversy, china, s, family, planning, policies, began, to, be, shaped, by, fears, of, overpopulation, in, the, 1970s, and, officials, raised, the, age, of, marriage, and, called, for, fewer, and, more, broadly, spaced, births, a, near, universal, one, child, limit, was, imposed, in, 1980, and, written, into, the, country, s, constitution, in, 1982, numerous, exceptions, were, established, over, time, and, by, 1984, only, about, 35, 4, of, the, population, was, subject, to, the, original, restriction, of, the, policy, 167, in, the, mid, 1980s, rural, parents, were, allowed, to, have, a, second, child, if, the, first, was, a, daughter, it, also, allowed, exceptions, for, some, other, groups, including, ethnic, minorities, under, 10, million, people, in, 2015, the, government, raised, the, limit, to, two, children, and, in, may, 2021, to, three, in, july, 2021, it, removed, all, limits, shortly, after, implementing, financial, incentives, to, encourage, individuals, to, have, additional, children, implementation, of, the, policy, was, handled, at, the, national, level, primarily, by, the, national, population, and, family, planning, commission, and, at, the, provincial, and, local, level, by, specialized, commissions, officials, used, pervasive, propaganda, campaigns, to, promote, the, program, and, encourage, compliance, the, strictness, with, which, it, was, enforced, varied, by, period, region, and, social, status, in, some, cases, women, were, forced, to, use, contraception, receive, abortions, and, undergo, sterilization, families, who, violated, the, policy, faced, large, fines, and, other, penalties, the, population, control, program, had, wide, ranging, social, effects, particularly, for, chinese, women, patriarchal, attitudes, and, a, cultural, preference, for, sons, led, to, the, abandonment, of, unwanted, infant, girls, some, of, whom, died, and, others, of, whom, were, adopted, abroad, over, time, this, skewed, the, country, s, sex, ratio, toward, men, and, created, a, generation, of, missing, women, however, the, policy, also, resulted, in, greater, workforce, participation, by, women, who, would, otherwise, have, been, occupied, with, childrearing, and, some, girls, received, greater, familial, investment, in, their, education, the, chinese, communist, party, ccp, credits, the, program, with, contributing, to, the, country, s, economic, ascendancy, and, says, that, it, prevented, 400, million, births, although, some, scholars, dispute, that, estimate, some, have, also, questioned, whether, the, drop, in, birth, rate, was, caused, more, by, other, factors, unrelated, to, the, policy, in, the, west, the, policy, has, been, widely, criticized, for, perceived, human, rights, violations, and, other, negative, effects, since, the, establishment, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, socialist, construction, was, the, utmost, mission, the, state, needed, to, accomplish, top, state, leaders, believed, that, having, more, population, would, effectively, contribute, to, the, national, effort, during, mao, zedong, s, leadership, in, china, the, birth, rate, fell, from, 37, per, thousand, to, 20, per, thousand, infant, mortality, declined, from, 227, per, thousand, births, in, 1949, to, 53, per, thousand, in, 1981, and, life, expectancy, dramatically, increased, from, around, 35, years, in, 1948, to, 66, years, in, 1976, until, the, 1960s, the, government, mostly, encouraged, families, to, have, as, many, children, as, possible, especially, during, the, great, leap, forward, because, of, mao, s, belief, that, population, growth, empowered, the, country, preventing, the, emergence, of, family, planning, programs, earlier, in, china, s, development, the, state, tried, to, incentivize, more, childbirths, during, that, time, with, a, variety, of, policies, such, as, the, mother, heroine, chinese, award, a, programme, inspired, by, a, similar, policy, in, the, soviet, union, as, a, result, the, population, grew, from, around, 540, million, in, 1949, to, 940, million, in, 1976, beginning, in, 1970, citizens, were, encouraged, to, marry, at, later, ages, and, many, were, limited, to, have, only, two, children, although, china, s, fertility, rate, plummeted, faster, than, anywhere, else, in, the, world, during, the, 1970s, under, these, restrictions, the, chinese, government, thought, it, was, still, too, high, influenced, by, the, global, debate, over, a, possible, overpopulation, crisis, suggested, by, organizations, such, as, the, club, of, rome, and, the, sierra, club, the, fertility, rate, dropped, from, 5, 9, in, the, 1950s, to, 4, 0, in, the, 1970s, yet, the, population, still, grew, at, a, significant, rate, there, were, approximately, 541, 670, 000, people, in, china, in, the, year, 1949, the, number, then, went, up, to, 806, 710, 000, in, 1969, in, the, early, 1970s, the, state, introduced, a, set, of, birth, planning, policies, it, mainly, called, for, later, childbearing, chinese, pinyin, w, n, longer, time, spans, between, having, new, children, chinese, pinyin, x, and, giving, birth, to, fewer, children, chinese, pinyin, sh, o, 57, men, were, encouraged, to, marry, at, age, 25, or, later, and, women, were, encouraged, to, marry, at, age, 23, or, later, 57, the, authorities, began, encouraging, one, child, families, in, 1978, and, in, 1979, announced, that, they, intended, to, advocate, for, one, child, families, ma, yinchu, a, founder, of, china, s, population, planning, theory, was, also, an, intellectual, architect, of, the, policy, in, the, late, spring, of, 1979, chen, yun, became, the, first, senior, leader, to, propose, the, one, child, policy, on, 1, june, 1979, chen, said, that, comrade, xiannian, proposed, to, me, planning, better, one, at, most, two, i, d, say, be, stricter, stipulating, that, only, one, is, allowed, prepare, to, be, criticized, by, others, for, cutting, off, the, offspring, but, if, we, don, t, do, it, the, future, looks, grim, deng, xiaoping, then, paramount, leader, of, china, supported, the, policy, along, with, other, senior, leaders, including, hua, guofeng, and, li, xiannian, on, 15, october, 1979, deng, met, a, british, delegation, led, by, felix, greene, in, beijing, saying, that, we, encourage, one, child, per, couple, we, give, economic, rewards, to, those, who, promise, to, give, birth, to, only, one, child, in, 1980, the, central, government, organized, a, meeting, in, chengdu, to, discuss, the, speed, and, scope, of, one, child, restrictions, the, notable, aerospace, engineer, song, jian, was, a, participant, at, the, chengdu, meeting, he, had, previously, read, two, influential, books, about, population, concerns, the, limits, to, growth, and, a, blueprint, for, survival, while, visiting, europe, in, 1980, along, with, several, associates, song, determined, that, the, ideal, population, of, china, was, 700, million, and, that, a, universal, one, child, policy, for, all, would, be, required, to, meet, that, goal, if, fertility, rates, remained, constant, at, 3, births, per, woman, china, s, population, would, surpass, 3, billion, by, 2060, and, 4, billion, by, 2080, in, spite, of, some, criticism, inside, the, ccp, the, family, planning, policy, was, formally, implemented, as, a, temporary, measure, on, 18, september, 1980, the, plan, called, for, families, to, have, one, child, each, in, order, to, curb, a, then, surging, population, and, alleviate, social, economic, and, environmental, problems, in, china, despite, the, legitimate, ongoing, rapid, growth, of, china, s, population, and, the, evident, effects, it, brought, to, society, using, the, term, population, crisis, to, describe, the, situation, is, disputed, scholars, including, susan, greenhalgh, argue, that, the, state, intentionally, created, a, virtual, population, crisis, in, order, to, serve, political, ends, according, to, state, promotions, the, looming, overpopulation, crisis, would, ruin, the, national, agenda, of, achieving, china, s, socialist, modernization, which, includes, industry, agriculture, national, defense, and, technology, china, s, attitude, towards, population, control, on, the, global, stage, in, international, forums, evidenced, an, ambiguous, stance, on, the, nature, of, the, crisis, in, the, mid, 1960s, when, global, movements, for, birth, control, emerged, chinese, delegates, expressed, their, opposition, toward, population, control, in, the, first, un, organized, world, population, conference, held, in, bucharest, in, 1969, they, claimed, that, it, was, an, imperialist, agenda, that, western, countries, imposed, on, third, world, countries, and, that, population, was, not, a, determining, factor, of, economic, growth, and, a, country, s, well, being, yet, in, the, domestic, setting, the, state, leaders, were, already, wary, of, the, perceived, population, crisis, that, was, thought, to, endanger, the, modernization, of, china, it, is, also, suggested, that, mathematical, terms, graphs, and, tables, were, utilized, to, form, a, convincing, narrative, that, presents, the, urgency, of, the, population, problem, as, well, as, justifies, the, necessity, of, mandatory, birth, control, across, the, nation, due, to, the, previous, traumas, of, the, cultural, revolution, public, and, top, state, leaders, turned, to, the, charisma, of, science, and, sometimes, blindly, worshipped, it, as, the, solution, to, every, problem, as, a, result, any, proposal, that, was, veiled, and, decorated, by, the, so, called, scientific, back, ups, would, be, highly, considered, by, both, the, people, and, the, state, arguments, started, to, come, out, in, 1979, suggesting, that, the, excessively, rapid, population, growth, was, sabotaging, the, economy, and, destroying, the, environment, and, essentially, preventing, china, from, being, a, rightful, member, of, the, global, world, skillful, and, deliberate, comparisons, were, made, with, developed, and, industrialized, countries, such, as, the, united, states, japan, and, france, under, such, a, comparison, china, s, relatively, low, income, per, capita, was, attributed, directly, to, population, growth, and, no, other, factors, though, the, data, is, truthful, its, arrangement, and, presentation, to, readers, gave, a, single, message, determined, by, the, state, that, the, population, problem, is, a, national, catastrophe, and, immediate, remedy, is, desperately, needed, china, was, deprived, of, data, skills, and, state, support, to, conduct, population, studies, due, to, mao, s, ambivalent, attitude, toward, the, population, issue, population, studies, were, abolished, in, the, late, 1950s, after, mao, s, death, family, planning, became, a, critical, component, and, premise, for, reaching, china, s, national, goal, that, is, to, achieve, china, s, socialist, modernization, which, includes, modernizing, industry, agriculture, national, defence, and, technology, therefore, at, this, point, population, science, was, closely, related, and, tied, with, state, politics, there, was, a, perceived, need, to, redefine, population, as, a, domain, of, science, identify, the, population, problem, in, china, and, propose, a, solution, to, it, such, efforts, included, many, groups, of, people, with, diverse, backgrounds, among, these, experts, two, groups, held, the, most, influence, in, defining, the, population, problem, and, providing, a, solution, to, it, they, were, a, group, of, scientists, led, by, liu, zheng, and, another, group, led, by, song, jian, liu, s, group, mainly, came, from, a, social, science, background, while, song, s, group, came, from, natural, science, background, social, scientists, involved, in, this, discussion, in, the, mid, 1970s, including, liu, zheng, wu, cangping, lin, fude, and, zha, ruichuan, prioritized, the, marxist, formulation, of, the, population, problem, they, saw, the, problem, as, an, imbalance, between, economic, and, demographic, growth, and, wished, to, design, a, reasonable, policy, that, considered, the, social, consequences, these, scientists, came, from, the, fields, of, social, science, statistics, genetics, history, and, many, others, however, they, had, limited, access, to, resources, compared, to, the, natural, scientists, who, became, involved, in, population, policy, making, in, 1978, since, population, studies, were, forbidden, from, the, 1950s, until, 1979, population, science, had, made, no, progress, between, these, two, decades, natural, scientists, were, interested, in, using, control, theory, and, applying, it, to, the, actual, policy, the, leader, of, the, group, song, jian, was, a, control, theorist, at, the, ministry, of, aerospace, industry, he, was, known, for, his, career, in, missile, science, yu, jingyuan, and, li, guangyuan, were, trained, engineers, in, the, field, of, cybernetics, compared, to, the, social, scientists, this, group, of, natural, scientists, had, numerous, advantages, they, were, politically, protected, during, the, maoist, period, due, to, their, importance, in, national, defense, and, technology, they, also, had, access, to, western, science, eventually, they, took, an, important, role, in, examining, the, population, model, as, well, as, designing, the, details, of, one, child, policies, after, quantitative, research, and, analysis, they, showed, the, top, state, leaders, that, the, only, solution, would, be, a, policy, to, encourage, all, couples, to, have, only, one, child, regardless, of, the, costs, to, individuals, and, society, although, greenhalgh, claims, that, song, jian, was, the, central, architect, of, the, one, child, policy, and, that, he, hijacked, the, population, policy, making, process, that, claim, has, been, refuted, by, several, leading, scholars, including, liang, zhongtang, a, leading, internal, critic, of, one, child, restrictions, and, an, eye, witness, at, the, discussions, in, chengdu, in, the, words, of, wang, et, al, the, idea, of, the, one, child, policy, came, from, leaders, within, the, party, not, from, scientists, who, offered, evidence, to, support, it, central, officials, had, already, decided, in, 1979, to, advocate, for, one, child, restrictions, before, knowing, of, song, s, work, and, upon, learning, of, his, work, in, 1980, already, seemed, sympathetic, to, his, position, the, one, child, policy, was, originally, designed, to, be, a, one, generation, policy, it, was, enforced, at, the, provincial, level, and, enforcement, varied, some, provinces, had, more, relaxed, restrictions, the, one, child, limit, was, most, strictly, enforced, in, densely, populated, urban, areas, when, this, policy, was, first, introduced, 6, 1, million, families, that, had, already, given, birth, to, a, child, were, given, one, child, honorary, certificates, this, was, a, pledge, they, had, to, make, to, ensure, they, would, not, have, more, children, beginning, in, 1980, the, official, policy, granted, local, officials, the, flexibility, to, make, exceptions, and, allow, second, children, in, the, case, of, practical, difficulties, such, as, cases, in, which, the, father, was, a, disabled, serviceman, or, when, both, parents, were, single, children, and, some, provinces, had, other, exemptions, worked, into, their, policies, as, well, in, most, areas, families, were, allowed, to, apply, to, have, a, second, child, if, their, first, born, was, a, daughter, by, 1984, only, approximately, 35, 4, of, the, population, fell, within, the, policy, s, original, restriction, 167, furthermore, families, with, children, with, disabilities, have, different, policies, and, families, whose, first, child, suffers, from, physical, disability, mental, illness, or, intellectual, disability, were, allowed, to, have, more, children, however, second, children, were, sometimes, subject, to, birth, spacing, usually, three, or, four, years, children, born, overseas, were, not, counted, under, the, policy, if, they, did, not, obtain, chinese, citizenship, chinese, citizens, returning, from, abroad, were, allowed, to, have, a, second, child, sichuan, province, allowed, exemptions, for, couples, of, certain, backgrounds, by, one, estimate, there, were, at, least, 22, ways, in, which, parents, could, qualify, for, exceptions, to, the, law, towards, the, end, of, the, one, child, policy, s, existence, in, 1991, the, central, government, made, local, governments, directly, responsible, for, family, planning, goals, 77, also, in, the, early, 1990s, experts, from, leading, population, research, institutes, began, appealing, to, policymakers, to, relax, or, end, the, one, child, policy, 79, as, of, 2007, only, 36, of, the, population, were, subjected, to, a, strict, one, child, limit, 53, were, permitted, to, have, a, second, child, if, their, first, was, a, daughter, 9, 6, of, chinese, couples, were, permitted, two, children, regardless, of, their, gender, and, 1, 6, mainly, tibetans, had, no, limit, at, all, following, the, devastating, 2008, sichuan, earthquake, a, new, exception, to, the, regulations, was, announced, in, sichuan, for, parents, who, had, lost, children, in, the, earthquake, similar, exceptions, had, previously, been, made, for, parents, of, severely, disabled, or, deceased, children, people, have, also, tried, to, evade, the, policy, by, giving, birth, to, a, second, child, in, hong, kong, but, at, least, for, guangdong, residents, the, one, child, policy, was, also, enforced, if, the, birth, took, place, in, hong, kong, or, abroad, in, accordance, with, china, s, affirmative, action, policies, towards, ethnic, minorities, all, non, han, ethnic, groups, were, subject, to, different, laws, and, were, usually, allowed, to, have, two, children, in, urban, areas, and, three, or, four, in, rural, areas, han, chinese, living, in, rural, towns, were, also, permitted, to, have, two, children, because, of, couples, such, as, these, as, well, as, those, who, simply, paid, a, fine, or, social, maintenance, fee, to, have, more, children, the, overall, fertility, rate, of, mainland, china, was, close, to, 1, 4, children, per, woman, as, of, 2011, on, 6, january, 2010, the, former, national, population, and, family, planning, commission, issued, the, national, population, development, 12th, five, year, plan, on, 1, january, 2016, the, one, child, policy, was, replaced, by, the, two, child, policy, the, one, child, policy, was, managed, by, the, national, population, and, family, planning, commission, under, the, central, government, since, 1981, the, ministry, of, health, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, the, national, population, and, family, planning, commission, were, made, defunct, and, a, new, single, agency, the, national, health, and, family, planning, commission, took, over, national, health, and, family, planning, policies, in, 2013, the, agency, reports, to, the, state, council, the, policy, was, enforced, at, the, provincial, level, through, contraception, abortion, and, fines, that, were, imposed, based, on, the, income, of, the, family, and, other, factors, population, and, family, planning, commissions, existed, at, every, level, of, government, to, raise, awareness, and, carry, out, registration, and, inspection, work, the, fine, was, a, so, called, social, maintenance, fee, the, punishment, for, the, families, who, had, more, than, one, child, according, to, the, policy, families, who, violated, the, law, created, a, burden, on, society, therefore, social, maintenance, fees, were, to, be, used, for, the, operation, of, the, government, the, 2019, documentary, one, child, nation, portrayed, the, experiences, of, enforcement, primarily, focusing, on, rural, china, enforcement, of, the, one, child, policy, was, more, uneven, in, rural, china, 187, the, family, planning, policy, was, enforced, through, a, financial, penalty, in, the, form, of, the, social, child, raising, fee, sometimes, called, a, family, planning, fine, in, the, west, which, was, collected, as, a, fraction, of, either, the, annual, disposable, income, of, city, dwellers, or, of, the, annual, cash, income, of, peasants, in, the, year, of, the, child, s, birth, for, instance, in, guangdong, the, fee, was, between, three, and, six, annual, incomes, for, incomes, below, the, district, s, per, capita, income, plus, one, to, two, times, the, annual, income, exceeding, the, average, families, were, required, to, pay, the, fine, the, one, child, policy, was, a, tool, for, china, to, not, only, address, overpopulation, but, to, also, address, poverty, alleviation, and, increase, social, mobility, by, consolidating, the, combined, inherited, wealth, of, the, two, previous, generations, into, the, investment, and, success, of, one, child, instead, of, having, these, resources, spread, thinly, across, multiple, children, this, theoretically, allowed, for, a, demographic, dividend, to, be, realized, increasing, economic, growth, and, increasing, gross, national, income, per, capita, if, the, family, was, not, able, to, pay, the, social, child, raising, fee, then, their, child, would, not, be, able, to, obtain, a, hukou, a, legal, registration, document, that, was, required, in, order, to, marry, attend, state, funded, schools, or, to, receive, health, care, many, who, were, unable, to, pay, the, fee, never, attempted, to, obtain, their, hukou, for, fear, that, the, government, would, force, extra, fees, upon, them, although, some, provinces, had, declared, that, payment, of, the, social, child, raising, fee, was, not, required, to, obtain, a, hukou, most, provinces, still, required, families, to, pay, retroactive, fines, after, registration, since, the, 1970s, the, intrauterine, device, iud, has, been, one, of, the, most, widely, promoted, and, practiced, forms, of, contraception, it, was, the, primary, alternative, to, sterilization, as, directed, the, iud, was, medically, implanted, into, women, in, their, child, bearing, years, to, prevent, pregnancies, thus, out, of, order, births, in, the, 1980s, women, either, had, to, receive, an, iud, after, giving, birth, to, their, first, child, or, the, husband, would, have, to, undergo, a, vasectomy, between, 1980, and, 2014, 324, million, chinese, women, received, iuds, and, 108, million, were, sterilized, by, law, the, iud, was, placed, four, months, after, the, delivery, of, the, first, child, it, was, only, medically, removed, after, permission, to, conceive, is, granted, by, the, community, based, upon, various, laws, and, policies, on, childbirth, quotas, despite, this, some, midwives, illegally, removed, the, device, from, their, patients, this, led, to, iud, inspections, ensuring, that, the, iud, remained, in, place, permanent, legal, removal, of, iuds, happens, once, a, woman, reaches, menopause, in, 2016, as, means, of, loosening, restrictions, and, abolishing, the, one, child, policy, the, chinese, government, now, covers, the, price, of, iud, removals, the, most, widely, used, alternative, to, iuds, has, been, sterilization, as, the, leading, form, of, contraception, in, china, sterilization, has, included, both, tubal, ligation, and, vasectomy, starting, in, the, early, 1970s, massive, sterilization, campaigns, swept, across, the, country, urban, and, rural, birth, planning, and, family, planning, services, situated, themselves, in, every, community, cash, payments, or, other, material, rewards, and, fines, acted, as, incentives, increasing, the, number, of, participants, socially, willing, participants, were, considered, role, models, in, the, community, in, 1983, mandatory, sterilization, occurred, after, the, birth, of, the, second, or, third, child, as, the, restrictions, tightened, a, few, years, later, if, a, woman, gave, birth, to, two, children, legally, she, had, to, be, sterilized, alternatively, in, some, cases, her, husband, could, be, sterilized, in, her, place, in, other, cases, sterilization, of, surplus, children, occurred, in, the, early, years, of, the, sterilization, campaigns, abortion, was, a, method, of, birth, control, highly, encouraged, by, family, planning, with, 55, percent, of, abortion, recipients, as, repeat, customers, and, the, procedure, easily, accessible, women, had, chosen, to, abort, and, had, been, forced, to, abort, because, of, laws, social, pressure, discovery, of, secret, pregnancy, and, community, birth, quotas, in, 1995, the, people, s, republic, of, china, prc, warned, against, abortion, as, a, means, of, family, planning, and, as, a, contraceptive, should, an, abortion, be, required, the, woman, was, to, have, a, safe, procedure, done, by, a, registered, physician, despite, this, some, women, even, in, the, 2000s, chose, or, were, encouraged, to, use, traditional, abortive, products, such, as, blister, beetles, also, known, as, mylabris, women, would, ingest, the, toxins, orally, or, by, means, of, douching, with, the, hopes, of, inducing, abortion, an, overdose, could, lead, to, death, of, the, mother, and, fetus, the, efficacy, of, these, products, has, been, very, low, with, a, high, mortality, rate, the, medical, community, and, prc, have, warned, against, use, of, these, traditional, methods, the, priorities, of, individual, families, also, played, a, role, in, the, birth, rate, families, debated, the, social, and, economic, stability, of, the, household, prior, to, conception, some, families, chose, to, follow, the, single, child, limit, due, to, varying, social, and, economic, factors, such, as, marrying, later, spacing, out, children, the, cost, of, raising, a, child, the, fines, for, having, multiple, children, birth, control, policies, and, the, accessibility, of, contraceptives, in, addition, those, who, violated, the, one, child, policy, could, lose, their, jobs, their, titles, a, portion, of, medical, insurance, and, opportunities, for, higher, education, for, the, second, child, they, could, also, face, sterilization, and, the, labeling, of, the, second, child, as, a, black, child, all, of, the, variables, played, an, important, role, in, couples, decisions, on, when, to, conceive, placing, their, social, and, economic, situation, above, the, desire, to, bear, additional, children, other, examples, of, contraceptives, have, included, the, morning, after, pill, birth, control, pills, and, condoms, the, morning, after, pill, has, made, up, 70, percent, of, oral, contraceptives, in, the, chinese, market, only, seven, percent, of, chinese, women, had, shared, that, they, use, the, pill, and, condom, in, combination, the, chinese, government, promoted, the, use, of, iuds, and, sterilization, over, the, combined, pill, and, condom, because, prc, authorities, questioned, the, voluntary, commitment, of, the, public, the, chinese, government, has, distributed, free, condoms, at, medical, clinics, and, health, centers, to, adults, with, proof, that, they, are, 18, years, of, age, or, older, additionally, the, rate, and, highly, debated, sexual, education, have, increased, awareness, of, sex, and, contraceptive, measures, among, groups, of, china, s, young, population, further, lowering, the, birth, rate, some, couples, paid, fines, to, have, a, second, or, third, child, and, others, would, attempt, to, circumvent, the, policy, by, having, non, pregnant, friends, take, the, mandatory, blood, tests, the, national, family, planning, committee, developed, the, slogan, wan, xi, shao, later, longer, and, fewer, which, was, first, enacted, in, 1973, and, was, in, effect, until, 1979, this, national, idea, encouraged, later, marriages, and, having, fewer, children, however, this, policy, was, not, effective, at, enforcing, the, developing, ideal, of, having, fewer, children, since, it, was, such, a, new, concept, that, had, never, been, seen, in, other, regions, of, the, world, the, various, problems, that, arose, during, its, introduction, were, slowly, addressed, and, it, became, progressively, more, targeted, to, corner, women, into, limited, control, over, their, own, bodies, the, wan, xi, shao, slogan, emerged, during, the, 1970s, as, a, response, to, china, s, rapid, population, growth, which, was, viewed, as, a, major, obstacle, to, the, country, s, economic, and, social, development, this, slogan, encapsulated, three, key, principles, marrying, later, wan, spacing, pregnancies, farther, apart, xi, and, having, fewer, children, shao, and, was, emblematic, of, china, s, national, campaign, of, mandatory, birth, planning, the, chinese, government, aimed, to, reduce, population, growth, by, promoting, guidelines, for, birth, control, and, family, planning, the, government, believed, that, having, fewer, children, and, spacing, births, more, adequately, would, allow, families, to, allocate, more, resources, per, child, resulting, in, better, health, and, education, outcomes, for, children, the, policy, aimed, to, achieve, this, by, allowing, parents, more, time, and, resources, to, invest, in, each, child, s, health, and, education, as, they, would, have, fewer, children, to, care, for, the, later, longer, fewer, campaign, was, later, replaced, by, the, one, child, policy, according, to, whyte, and, colleagues, many, of, the, coercive, techniques, that, became, notorious, after, the, one, child, policy, was, launched, actually, date, from, this, campaign, in, the, 1970s, during, the, campaign, the, state, bureaucracy, was, in, charge, of, enforcing, birth, control, and, oversaw, birth, planning, workers, in, every, village, urban, work, unit, and, neighborhood, these, workers, kept, detailed, records, on, women, of, child, bearing, age, including, past, births, contraceptive, usage, and, menstrual, cycles, often, becoming, menstrual, monitors, to, detect, out, of, quota, pregnancies, in, some, factories, there, were, quotas, for, reproduction, and, women, who, did, not, receive, a, birth, allotment, were, not, supposed, to, get, pregnant, women, who, became, pregnant, without, permission, were, harassed, to, get, an, abortion, with, pressure, also, put, on, their, husbands, and, other, family, members, families, were, threatened, that, if, they, persisted, in, having, an, over, quota, birth, the, baby, would, be, denied, household, registration, which, would, mean, denial, of, ration, coupons, schooling, and, other, essential, benefits, that, depended, upon, registration, in, rural, areas, women, who, gave, birth, to, a, third, child, were, pressured, to, get, sterilized, or, have, iuds, inserted, while, urban, women, were, trusted, to, continue, using, effective, contraception, until, they, were, no, longer, fertile, official, statistics, show, that, birth, control, operations, including, abortions, iud, insertions, and, sterilizations, increased, sharply, during, the, 1970s, in, association, with, the, campaign, to, enforce, birth, limits, these, drastic, increases, in, birth, control, operations, suggest, that, highly, coercive, birth, planning, enforcement, was, already, prevalent, in, both, rural, and, urban, areas, preceding, the, launch, of, the, one, child, policy, however, during, the, 1970s, the, chinese, government, was, still, concerned, that, the, wan, xi, shao, policy, would, not, reduce, the, growing, population, sufficiently, they, felt, the, population, would, grow, too, fast, to, be, supported, and, a, one, child, policy, for, all, families, was, introduced, in, 1979, many, of, the, tactics, used, by, the, government, were, reflected, in, the, day, to, day, life, of, the, average, chinese, citizen, since, the, chinese, government, could, not, outright, force, its, inhabitants, to, follow, strict, policy, orders, the, government, developed, strategies, to, encourage, and, promote, individuals, to, take, on, this, responsibility, themselves, a, common, technique, was, placing, an, emphasis, on, family, bonds, and, how, having, one, child, per, family, would, increase, emotional, ties, in, parent, offspring, relationships, as, well, as, extended, family, giving, all, their, attention, to, fewer, children, while, the, message, of, population, reduction, was, urgent, and, required, immediate, attention, it, was, more, important, for, the, government, to, stop, conception, and, new, pregnancies, the, family, planning, commission, spread, propaganda, by, placing, pictures, and, images, on, everyday, items, aside, from, signs, and, posters, on, billboards, advertisements, were, placed, on, postage, stamps, milk, cartons, food, products, and, many, other, household, items, to, promote, the, benefits, of, having, one, child, propaganda, took, many, forms, throughout, the, one, child, policy, era, and, was, able, to, target, a, wide, range, of, age, demographics, children, born, in, this, time, period, spent, most, of, their, lives, being, exposed, to, the, new, expectations, placed, on, them, by, society, educational, programs, were, also, encouraged, to, promote, one, child, policy, expectations, many, young, teenagers, were, required, to, read, renkou, jiayu, 1981, which, emphasized, the, importance, of, family, planning, and, birth, control, measures, that, would, ensure, the, stability, of, the, nation, younger, generations, became, the, main, target, audience, for, much, of, the, propaganda, as, the, one, child, policy, continued, since, they, made, up, a, large, portion, of, the, population, that, would, contribute, to, continued, growth, if, no, policy, was, put, in, place, the, one, child, campaign, extensively, used, propaganda, posters, the, aim, of, the, posters, was, to, promote, the, policy, encourage, compliance, and, emphasize, the, benefits, of, having, fewer, children, many, of, the, posters, were, educational, in, nature, paying, attention, to, reproduction, sexuality, and, conception, they, were, produced, by, various, government, departments, ranging, from, ministries, of, health, to, local, population, policy, centers, to, convey, the, idea, that, couples, should, only, have, one, child, the, one, child, campaign, utilized, traditional, visual, elements, from, nianhua, new, year, prints, that, were, popular, among, the, people, traditionally, these, prints, employ, visual, symbols, to, convey, good, wishes, for, the, coming, new, year, in, the, prints, young, children, often, have, been, portrayed, with, pink, chubby, cheeks, to, symbolize, the, success, of, family, reproduction, and, a, hopeful, future, even, without, slogans, these, pictures, were, effective, in, establishing, a, link, between, luck, and, prosperity, associated, with, the, new, year, and, the, one, child, policy, traditional, elements, like, chubby, healthy, looking, babies, resonated, with, people, making, them, believe, that, compliance, with, the, policy, would, yield, luck, good, fortune, and, healthy, offspring, as, the, one, child, campaign, progressed, the, policy, was, linked, to, national, development, and, wealth, it, was, considered, directly, linked, to, the, success, of, the, policy, of, modernization, and, reform, by, promoting, the, one, child, policy, on, a, daily, basis, the, government, was, able, to, convince, the, people, that, it, was, their, duty, to, fulfill, this, nationalistic, pride, once, the, idea, and, initial, steps, of, this, policy, were, introduced, into, society, it, was, regulated, by, local, policy, enforcers, until, finally, becoming, an, internal, obligation, the, community, accepted, for, the, greater, good, of, maintaining, a, nation, in, many, cases, health, centers, encouraged, the, idea, of, reducing, the, risks, of, pregnancy, by, distributing, various, forms, of, contraceptives, at, no, cost, which, made, protected, sex, more, common, than, unprotected, sex, couples, who, only, had, one, child, received, healthcare, subsidies, baojian, fei, retirement, funds, and, larger, grain, allowances, 186, in, 2013, deputy, director, wang, peian, of, the, national, health, and, family, planning, commission, said, that, china, s, population, will, not, grow, substantially, in, the, short, term, a, survey, by, the, commission, found, that, only, about, half, of, eligible, couples, wish, to, have, two, children, mostly, because, of, the, cost, of, living, impact, of, a, second, child, in, november, 2013, following, the, third, plenum, of, the, 18th, central, committee, of, the, chinese, communist, party, ccp, china, announced, the, decision, to, relax, the, one, child, policy, under, the, new, policy, families, could, have, two, children, if, one, parent, rather, than, both, parents, was, an, only, child, this, mainly, applied, to, urban, couples, since, there, were, very, few, rural, only, children, due, to, long, standing, exceptions, to, the, policy, for, rural, couples, zhejiang, one, of, the, most, affluent, provinces, became, the, first, area, to, implement, this, relaxed, policy, in, january, 2014, and, 29, out, of, the, 31, provinces, had, implemented, it, by, july, 2014, with, the, exceptions, of, xinjiang, and, tibet, under, this, policy, approximately, 11, million, couples, in, china, were, allowed, to, have, a, second, child, however, only, nearly, one, million, couples, applied, to, have, a, second, child, in, 2014, less, than, half, the, expected, number, of, 2, million, per, year, by, may, 2014, 241, 000, out, of, 271, 000, applications, had, been, approved, officials, of, china, s, national, health, and, family, planning, commission, claimed, that, this, outcome, was, expected, and, that, the, second, child, policy, would, continue, progressing, with, a, good, start, in, october, 2015, the, chinese, news, agency, xinhua, announced, the, government, s, plans, to, abolish, the, one, child, policy, now, allowing, all, families, to, have, two, children, citing, a, communiqu, issued, by, the, ccp, to, improve, the, balanced, development, of, population, an, apparent, reference, to, the, country, s, female, to, male, sex, ratio, and, to, deal, with, an, aging, population, the, new, law, took, effect, on, 1, january, 2016, after, it, was, passed, in, the, standing, committee, of, the, national, people, s, congress, on, 27, december, 2015, the, rationale, for, the, abolition, was, summarized, by, former, wall, street, journal, reporter, mei, fong, the, reason, china, is, doing, this, right, now, is, because, they, have, too, many, men, too, many, old, people, and, too, few, young, people, they, have, this, huge, crushing, demographic, crisis, as, a, result, of, the, one, child, policy, and, if, people, don, t, start, having, more, children, they, re, going, to, have, a, vastly, diminished, workforce, to, support, a, huge, aging, population, china, s, ratio, is, about, five, working, adults, to, one, retiree, the, huge, retiree, community, must, be, supported, and, that, will, dampen, future, growth, according, to, fong, since, the, citizens, of, china, are, living, longer, and, having, fewer, children, the, growth, of, the, population, imbalance, is, expected, to, continue, a, united, nations, projection, forecast, that, china, will, lose, 67, million, working, age, people, by, 2030, while, simultaneously, doubling, the, number, of, elderly, that, could, put, immense, pressure, on, the, economy, and, government, resources, the, longer, term, outlook, is, also, pessimistic, based, on, an, estimate, by, the, chinese, academy, of, social, sciences, revealed, by, cai, fang, deputy, director, by, 2050, one, third, of, the, country, will, be, aged, 60, years, or, older, and, there, will, be, fewer, workers, supporting, each, retired, person, although, many, critics, of, china, s, reproductive, restrictions, approved, of, the, policy, s, abolition, amnesty, international, said, that, the, move, to, the, two, child, policy, would, not, end, forced, sterilizations, forced, abortions, or, government, control, over, birth, permits, others, had, also, stated, that, the, abolition, was, not, a, sign, of, the, relaxation, of, authoritarian, control, in, china, a, reporter, for, cnn, said, it, was, not, a, sign, that, the, party, will, suddenly, start, respecting, personal, freedoms, more, than, it, has, in, the, past, no, this, is, a, case, of, the, party, adjusting, policy, to, conditions, the, new, policy, raising, the, limit, to, two, children, per, couple, preserves, the, state, s, role, the, abolition, having, a, significant, benefit, was, uncertain, as, a, cbc, news, analysis, indicated, repealing, the, one, child, policy, may, not, spur, a, huge, baby, boom, however, in, part, because, fertility, rates, are, believed, to, be, declining, even, without, the, policy, s, enforcement, previous, easings, of, the, one, child, policy, have, spurred, fewer, births, than, expected, and, many, people, among, china, s, younger, generations, see, smaller, family, sizes, as, ideal, the, cnn, reporter, added, that, china, s, new, prosperity, was, also, a, factor, in, the, declining, birth, rate, saying, couples, naturally, decide, to, have, fewer, children, as, they, move, from, the, fields, into, the, cities, become, more, educated, and, when, women, establish, careers, outside, the, home, the, chinese, government, had, expected, the, abolition, of, the, one, child, rule, would, lead, to, an, increase, in, births, to, about, 21, 9, million, births, in, 2018, the, actual, number, of, births, was, 15, 2, million, the, lowest, birth, rate, since, 1961, on, 31, may, 2021, china, s, government, relaxed, restrictions, even, more, allowing, women, up, to, three, children, this, change, was, brought, about, mainly, due, to, the, declining, birth, rate, and, population, growth, although, the, chinese, government, was, trying, to, spark, new, growth, in, the, population, some, experts, did, not, think, it, would, be, enough, many, called, for, the, government, to, remove, the, limit, altogether, though, most, women, and, couples, already, had, adopted, the, idea, that, one, child, is, enough, and, to, have, more, is, not, in, their, best, interest, because, of, this, new, belief, the, population, would, be, likely, to, keep, declining, which, could, have, tragic, repercussions, for, china, in, the, coming, decades, all, restrictions, were, lifted, on, 26, july, 2021, thus, allowing, chinese, couples, to, have, any, number, of, children, in, 2022, the, number, of, births, in, china, hit, another, record, low, of, 9, 56, million, births, the, first, time, the, number, had, dipped, below, 10, million, since, the, late, 1940s, according, to, china, daily, 9, 02, million, births, took, place, in, 2023, falling, numbers, of, women, of, childbearing, age, and, reluctance, of, young, women, to, have, children, had, reduced, the, china, s, fertility, rate, to, close, to, 1, 0, by, 2024, a, fertility, rate, of, 2, 1, is, needed, for, a, stable, population, a, study, by, the, shanghai, academy, of, social, sciences, and, victoria, university, melbourne, australia, forecast, china, s, population, would, be, 525, million, in, 2100, compared, to, 1, 4, billion, in, 2024, in, addition, to, stories, of, resistance, to, the, policy, and, official, reasons, for, support, such, as, strengthening, china, academic, sarah, mellors, rodriguez, describes, a, surprising, number, of, accounts, from, her, fieldwork, in, which, interviewees, fully, supported, the, mandate, for, personal, reasons, 186, according, to, mellors, rodriguez, for, some, couples, the, policy, affirmed, their, own, personal, beliefs, that, having, smaller, families, was, wiser, and, more, economical, 186, 187, china, s, urban, population, generally, accepted, the, policy, given, the, already, crowded, circumstances, and, shortage, of, housing, in, cities, 175, incentives, offered, by, the, state, also, were, effective, to, make, the, urban, population, compliant, with, the, newly, introduced, family, planning, families, that, signed, the, single, child, pledge, and, met, the, requirements, of, having, only, one, child, were, given, access, to, housing, and, daycare, while, non, compliant, ones, would, receive, penalties, examples, are, obstructing, the, parents, careers, and, delaying, the, payment, of, their, salaries, in, her, fieldwork, interviews, mellors, rodriguez, found, that, middle, income, urbanites, were, more, receptive, to, the, limitations, of, the, policy, because, they, generally, believed, that, having, one, child, and, providing, them, with, all, possible, opportunities, was, more, important, than, having, additional, heirs, 169, long, term, urban, residents, also, reported, that, supporting, multiple, children, was, expensive, and, burdensome, 169, the, rural, population, was, more, resistant, to, the, policy, 187, and, variations, upon, the, policy, were, permitted, mothers, of, a, daughter, in, several, rural, provinces, were, allowed, to, have, a, single, additional, child, a, 1, 5, child, policy, and, families, in, remote, areas, a, second, or, third, child, after, collective, co, ops, were, dismantled, and, decollectivization, took, place, children, became, more, valued, by, their, parents, as, a, source, of, agricultural, production, and, as, a, source, of, the, care, required, by, ageing, parents, due, to, the, inherently, patrilocal, nature, of, marriage, it, was, expected, that, daughters, would, leave, their, parents, and, contribute, labor, to, their, husbands, households, the, consequent, preference, for, sons, came, into, conflict, with, the, one, child, policy, and, government, enforcement, of, this, policy, coercive, enforcement, measures, were, taken, and, included, abortions, of, over, quota, pregnancies, and, sterilization, of, women, this, led, to, a, series, of, physical, conflicts, with, the, government, cadres, who, were, assigned, to, enforce, the, policy, in, a, specific, rural, area, rural, families, wished, to, add, sons, to, their, families, in, order, to, contribute, to, agricultural, production, but, the, cadres, came, on, the, way, in, conflict, with, them, many, cadres, were, middle, aged, women, who, went, through, the, collective, period, when, childbearing, was, encouraged, they, experienced, continuous, childbearing, and, so, were, strongly, supportive, of, the, one, child, policy, when, these, two, distinct, groups, disapproved, of, each, other, conflicts, came, more, than, that, rural, families, that, were, desperate, to, have, a, son, would, abuse, women, who, could, not, give, birth, to, one, they, also, abandoned, infant, girls, and, even, engaged, in, infanticide, as, a, result, societal, relationships, were, tense, within, families, and, also, between, the, cadres, and, people, since, the, 1990s, rural, policy, violations, decreased, sharply, 193, anthropologist, yan, yunxiang, attributes, this, decrease, to, greater, acceptance, of, family, planning, among, the, new, generation, of, parents, as, well, as, their, increased, prioritization, of, material, comforts, and, individual, happiness, 193, below, are, the, results, of, the, first, three, national, population, census, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, first, two, censuses, date, back, to, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, and, the, last, one, in, the, 1980s, they, were, conducted, in, 1953, 1964, and, 1982, respectively, 51, 82, 51, 33, 51, 5, 48, 18, 48, 67, 48, 5, below, are, the, results, of, population, investigation, after, the, implementation, of, one, child, policy, 2005, 1, 51, 6, 51, 53, 51, 27, 48, 4, 48, 47, 48, 73, the, total, fertility, rate, in, china, continued, its, fall, from, 2, 8, births, per, woman, in, 1979, already, a, sharp, reduction, from, more, than, five, births, per, woman, in, the, early, 1970s, to, 1, 5, by, the, mid, 1990s, some, scholars, claim, that, this, decline, is, similar, to, that, observed, in, other, places, that, had, no, one, child, restrictions, such, as, thailand, as, well, as, the, indian, states, of, kerala, and, tamil, nadu, a, claim, designed, to, support, the, argument, that, china, s, fertility, might, have, fallen, to, such, levels, anyway, without, draconian, fertility, restrictions, according, to, a, 2017, study, in, the, journal, of, economic, perspectives, the, one, child, policy, accelerated, the, already, occurring, drop, in, fertility, for, a, few, years, but, in, the, longer, term, economic, development, played, a, more, fundamental, role, in, leading, to, and, maintaining, china, s, low, fertility, level, however, a, more, recent, study, found, that, china, s, fertility, decline, to, very, low, levels, by, the, mid, 1990s, was, far, more, impressive, given, its, lower, level, of, socio, economic, development, at, that, time, even, after, taking, rapid, economic, development, into, account, china, s, fertility, restrictions, likely, averted, over, 500, million, births, between, 1970, and, 2015, with, the, portion, caused, by, one, child, restrictions, possibly, totaling, 400, million, fertility, restrictions, also, had, unintended, consequences, such, as, a, deficit, of, 40, million, female, babies, most, of, which, was, due, to, sex, selective, abortion, and, the, accelerated, aging, of, china, s, population, the, sex, ratio, of, a, newborn, infant, between, male, and, female, births, in, mainland, china, reached, 117, 100, and, stabilized, between, 2000, and, 2013, about, 10, higher, than, the, baseline, which, ranges, between, 103, 100, and, 107, 100, it, had, risen, from, 108, 100, in, 1981, at, the, boundary, of, the, natural, baseline, to, 111, 100, in, 1990, according, to, a, report, by, the, national, population, and, family, planning, commission, there, would, be, 30, million, more, men, than, women, in, 2020, potentially, leading, to, social, instability, and, courtship, motivated, emigration, the, estimate, of, 30, million, cited, for, the, sex, disparity, however, may, have, been, very, exaggerated, as, birth, statistics, have, been, skewed, by, late, registrations, and, unreported, births, for, instance, researchers, have, found, that, census, statistics, for, women, in, later, stages, of, life, do, not, match, the, birth, statistics, the, disparity, in, the, gender, ratio, at, birth, increased, dramatically, after, the, first, birth, for, which, the, ratios, remained, steadily, within, the, natural, baseline, over, the, 20, year, interval, between, 1980, and, 1999, thus, a, large, majority, of, couples, appeared, to, accept, the, outcome, of, the, first, pregnancy, whether, it, was, a, boy, or, a, girl, if, the, first, child, was, a, girl, and, they, were, able, to, have, a, second, child, then, a, couple, may, have, taken, extraordinary, steps, to, assure, that, the, second, child, was, a, boy, if, a, couple, already, had, two, or, more, boys, the, sex, ratio, of, higher, parity, births, swung, decidedly, in, a, feminine, direction, this, demographic, evidence, indicates, that, while, families, highly, valued, having, male, offspring, a, secondary, norm, of, having, a, girl, or, having, some, balance, in, the, sexes, of, children, often, came, into, play, yi, zeng, 1993, reported, a, study, based, on, the, 1990, census, in, which, they, found, sex, ratios, of, just, 65, or, 70, boys, per, 100, girls, for, births, in, families, that, already, had, two, or, more, boys, a, study, by, anderson, silver, 1995, found, a, similar, pattern, among, both, han, and, non, han, nationalities, in, xinjiang, province, a, strong, preference, for, girls, in, high, parity, births, in, families, that, had, already, borne, two, or, more, boys, this, tendency, to, favour, girls, in, high, parity, births, to, couples, who, had, already, borne, sons, was, later, also, noted, by, coale, and, banister, who, suggested, as, well, that, once, a, couple, had, achieved, its, goal, for, the, number, of, males, it, was, also, much, more, likely, to, engage, in, stopping, behavior, i, e, to, stop, having, more, children, the, long, term, disparity, led, to, a, significant, gender, imbalance, or, skewing, of, the, sex, ratio, as, reported, by, the, canadian, broadcasting, corporation, in, 2015, china, had, between, 32, million, and, 36, million, more, males, than, would, be, expected, naturally, and, this, led, to, social, problems, because, of, a, traditional, preference, for, baby, boys, over, girls, the, one, child, policy, is, often, cited, as, the, cause, of, china, s, skewed, sex, ratio, even, the, government, acknowledges, the, problem, and, has, expressed, concern, about, the, tens, of, millions, of, young, men, who, won, t, be, able, to, find, brides, and, may, turn, to, kidnapping, women, sex, trafficking, other, forms, of, crime, or, social, unrest, the, situation, was, not, expected, improve, in, the, near, future, according, to, the, chinese, academy, of, social, sciences, there, would, be, 24, million, more, men, than, women, of, marriageable, age, by, 2020, as, the, gender, gap, became, more, prominent, due, to, the, preference, of, male, children, over, female, offspring, policy, enforcers, shifted, their, attention, to, promoting, the, benefits, that, came, with, having, daughters, in, rural, isolated, regions, of, china, the, government, provided, families, with, a, daughter, more, access, to, education, and, other, resources, such, as, job, opportunities, to, parents, in, order, to, encourage, the, idea, that, having, a, daughter, also, has, a, positive, impact, on, the, family, in, december, 2016, researchers, at, the, university, of, kansas, reported, that, the, sex, disparity, in, china, was, likely, exaggerated, due, to, administrative, under, reporting, and, delayed, registration, of, females, rather, than, abortion, and, infanticide, the, finding, concluded, that, as, many, as, 10, to, 15, million, missing, women, had, not, been, properly, registered, at, birth, since, 1982, the, study, found, that, the, sex, ratios, of, age, groups, during, the, one, child, policy, were, similar, to, those, born, in, the, period, without, the, single, child, policy, the, study, also, found, significant, amounts, of, females, appear, after, the, age, of, ten, due, to, late, registration, across, different, age, groups, the, reason, for, under, reporting, was, attributed, to, families, trying, to, avoid, penalties, when, girls, are, born, and, local, government, concealing, the, lack, of, enforcement, from, the, central, government, this, implied, that, the, sex, disparity, of, the, chinese, newborns, was, likely, exaggerated, significantly, in, previous, analyses, though, the, degree, of, data, discrepancy, the, challenge, in, relation, to, the, sex, ratio, imbalance, in, china, is, still, disputed, among, scholars, the, one, child, policy, has, been, a, factor, in, china, s, rapid, increase, in, higher, educational, attainment, 59, research, shows, that, a, stricter, fertility, policy, would, induce, higher, female, educational, achievement, prior, to, the, one, child, policy, roughly, 30, of, women, attended, higher, education, whereas, between, 1990, and, 1992, 50, percent, of, students, in, higher, education, were, women, the, higher, participation, rate, of, women, in, education, could, be, attributed, to, the, lack, of, male, siblings, as, a, result, families, invested, in, their, single, female, child, several, studies, conclude, that, girls, on, average, received, more, years, of, schooling, thanks, to, the, one, child, policy, 69, the, one, child, policy, prompted, the, growth, of, orphanages, in, the, 1980s, for, parents, who, had, unauthorized, births, or, who, wanted, a, son, but, had, a, daughter, giving, up, their, child, for, adoption, was, a, strategy, to, avoid, penalties, under, one, child, restrictions, many, orphanages, witnessed, an, influx, of, baby, girls, as, families, would, abandon, them, in, favor, of, having, a, male, child, many, families, also, kept, their, illegal, children, hidden, so, that, they, would, not, be, punished, by, the, government, in, fact, out, adoption, was, not, uncommon, in, china, even, before, birth, planning, in, the, 1980s, adoptions, of, daughters, accounted, for, slightly, above, half, of, the, so, called, missing, girls, as, out, adopted, daughters, often, went, unreported, in, censuses, and, surveys, while, adoptive, parents, were, not, penalized, for, violating, the, birth, quota, however, in, 1991, a, central, decree, attempted, to, close, off, this, loophole, by, raising, penalties, and, levying, them, on, any, household, that, had, an, unauthorized, child, including, those, which, had, adopted, children, this, closing, of, the, adoption, loophole, resulted, in, the, abandonment, of, some, two, million, chinese, children, most, of, whom, were, daughters, many, of, these, children, ended, up, in, orphanages, with, approximately, 120, 000, of, them, being, adopted, by, parents, from, abroad, the, peak, wave, of, abandonment, occurred, in, the, 1990s, with, a, smaller, wave, after, 2000, around, the, same, time, poor, care, and, high, mortality, rates, in, some, state, orphanages, generated, intense, international, pressure, for, reform, after, 2005, the, number, of, international, adoptions, declined, due, both, to, falling, birth, rates, and, the, related, increase, in, demand, for, adoptions, by, chinese, parents, themselves, in, an, interview, with, national, public, radio, on, 30, october, 2015, adam, pertman, president, and, ceo, of, the, national, center, on, adoption, and, permanency, indicated, that, the, infant, girls, of, yesteryear, have, not, been, available, if, you, will, for, five, seven, years, china, has, been, trying, to, keep, the, girls, within, the, country, and, the, consequence, is, that, today, rather, than, those, young, girls, who, used, to, be, available, primarily, girls, today, it, s, older, children, children, with, special, needs, children, in, sibling, groups, it, s, very, very, different, in, april, 1992, china, implemented, laws, that, enabled, foreigners, to, adopt, their, orphan, children, with, the, number, of, children, each, orphanage, could, offer, for, international, adoption, being, limited, by, the, china, center, of, adoption, affairs, that, same, year, 206, children, were, adopted, to, the, united, states, according, to, the, u, s, state, department, since, then, the, demand, for, healthy, infant, girls, increased, and, transnational, adoption, increased, rapidly, in, accordance, with, this, high, demand, china, began, defining, more, restrictions, on, foreign, adoption, including, limitations, on, applicant, s, age, marital, status, mental, and, physical, health, income, family, size, and, education, according, to, the, u, s, state, department, there, have, been, over, 80, 000, international, adoptions, from, china, since, international, adoptions, were, implemented, as, the, flow, of, foreigners, adopting, from, china, increased, so, did, illicit, adoption, practices, families, in, china, that, did, not, or, could, not, keep, their, child, would, often, be, subject, to, abandonment, or, infanticide, abandoned, babies, often, found, themselves, in, orphanages, ready, to, be, adopted, this, also, made, it, easy, for, governments, to, engage, in, the, trafficking, of, children, in, the, years, between, 2002, and, 2005, officials, in, hunan, and, guangdong, provinces, profited, from, the, buying, and, trafficking, of, approximately, 1, 000, abducted, babies, for, international, adoption, since, there, were, no, penalties, for, multiple, births, 58, it, was, believed, that, an, increasing, number, of, couples, were, turning, to, fertility, medicine, to, induce, the, conception, of, twins, according, to, a, 2006, china, daily, report, the, number, of, twins, born, per, year, was, estimated, to, have, doubled, a, 2016, study, concluded, that, the, increase, in, the, policy, fine, of, one, year, s, income, is, associated, with, an, increase, in, twin, births, by, approximately, 0, 07, per, 1, 000, births, indicating, that, at, least, one, third, of, the, increase, in, twins, since, the, 1970s, could, be, explained, by, the, one, child, policy, the, increase, in, the, number, of, only, child, girls, resulted, in, gradual, changes, in, social, norms, regarding, gender, including, a, decrease, in, the, inequalities, between, women, and, men, 66, the, one, child, policy, s, limit, on, the, number, of, children, resulted, in, new, mothers, having, more, resources, to, start, investing, money, in, their, own, well, being, as, a, result, of, being, an, only, child, women, had, increased, opportunities, to, receive, an, education, and, support, to, get, better, jobs, one, side, effect, of, the, one, child, policy, was, the, liberation, of, women, from, the, significant, duties, of, taking, care, of, many, children, and, the, family, in, the, past, instead, women, have, had, more, time, for, themselves, to, pursue, their, career, or, hobbies, the, other, major, side, effect, of, the, policy, was, that, the, traditional, concepts, of, gender, roles, between, men, and, women, have, weakened, being, one, and, the, only, chance, the, parents, have, women, have, been, expected, to, compete, with, peer, men, for, better, educational, resources, or, career, opportunities, especially, in, cities, where, the, one, child, policy, was, much, more, regulated, and, enforced, expectations, for, women, to, succeed, in, life, are, no, less, than, for, men, recent, data, has, shown, that, the, proportion, of, women, attending, college, is, higher, than, that, of, men, the, policy, also, had, a, positive, effect, at, 10, to, 19, years, of, age, on, the, likelihood, of, completing, senior, high, school, in, women, of, han, ethnicity, at, the, same, time, the, one, child, policy, reduced, the, economic, burden, for, each, family, the, average, conditions, for, each, family, improved, as, a, result, women, also, have, had, much, more, freedom, within, the, family, they, have, been, supported, by, family, to, pursue, life, achievements, mothers, who, complied, with, the, policy, were, able, to, have, longer, maternity, leave, periods, as, long, as, they, were, older, than, 24, the, government, encouraged, couples, to, start, family, planning, at, an, older, age, since, many, of, these, women, were, employed, the, incentive, to, have, later, births, was, to, provide, paid, leave, as, long, as, they, followed, the, expectation, of, having, one, child, however, if, they, happened, to, have, a, second, pregnancy, they, were, stripped, of, their, privileges, and, were, not, given, the, same, resources, compared, to, their, first, birth, during, this, time, period, another, shift, in, attitude, towards, women, was, the, harsh, punishment, they, would, receive, if, they, acted, against, the, newly, established, policy, in, areas, such, as, shanghai, women, faced, similar, punishments, as, men, while, before, the, revolution, they, tended, to, have, more, lenient, penalties, women, s, experiences, of, the, one, child, policy, shaped, their, perceptions, of, it, both, of, which, have, been, studied, extensively, by, researchers, these, studies, have, revealed, a, variety, of, perspectives, while, some, women, viewed, the, policy, as, beneficial, particularly, in, terms, of, providing, better, educational, and, employment, opportunities, for, their, children, others, experienced, significant, negative, effects, including, gender, based, discrimination, psychological, distress, and, social, stigma, as, a, byproduct, of, the, policy, one, study, by, greenhalgh, et, al, 2005, found, that, many, urban, women, in, china, perceived, the, one, child, policy, as, positive, as, it, allowed, them, to, have, greater, control, over, their, reproductive, health, and, career, trajectories, these, women, also, valued, the, educational, and, economic, opportunities, afforded, to, their, single, child, which, were, seen, as, providing, a, pathway, out, of, poverty, and, towards, upward, mobility, however, the, same, study, also, found, that, women, s, perceptions, of, the, one, child, policy, were, heavily, influenced, by, their, social, and, economic, circumstances, for, example, women, who, were, unable, to, afford, the, fines, associated, with, violating, the, policy, were, more, likely, to, form, negative, perceptions, as, were, women, who, faced, pressure, from, their, families, to, have, a, male, child, another, study, by, poston, and, glover, 2005, found, that, women, in, rural, china, were, more, likely, to, view, the, policy, as, negative, these, women, reported, experiencing, significant, pressure, to, have, a, male, child, and, those, who, were, unable, to, do, so, faced, social, stigma, and, discrimination, in, addition, women, who, violated, the, policy, by, having, a, second, child, were, subject, to, fines, job, loss, and, other, penalties, which, could, have, significant, economic, and, social, consequences, a, study, by, mosher, 2012, found, that, women, who, underwent, forced, abortions, or, sterilizations, as, a, result, of, the, one, child, policy, experienced, significant, psychological, distress, including, depression, anxiety, and, trauma, these, women, reported, feeling, violated, and, traumatized, by, the, forced, abortions, and, sterilizations, that, occurred, as, a, byproduct, of, the, one, child, policy, such, experiences, could, have, long, lasting, effects, on, their, mental, health, and, wellbeing, taken, together, these, studies, suggest, that, women, s, diverse, perceptions, of, the, one, child, policy, were, based, on, their, individual, experiences, with, it, these, experiences, were, heavily, dependent, on, women, s, social, and, economic, circumstances, which, led, to, varied, perceptions, and, attitudes, on, the, policy, while, some, women, perceived, it, as, positive, particularly, in, urban, areas, others, experienced, significant, negative, effects, including, psychological, distress, and, social, stigma, the, one, child, policy, contributed, to, china, s, decrease, in, maternal, and, child, mortality, 66, it, is, reported, that, the, focus, of, china, on, population, planning, has, helped, to, provide, better, healthcare, for, women, and, a, reduction, in, the, risks, of, death, and, injury, associated, with, pregnancy, women, and, children, were, eligible, for, preferential, hospital, treatment, at, family, planning, offices, women, received, free, contraception, and, prenatal, classes, that, contributed, to, the, policy, s, success, in, two, respects, first, the, average, chinese, household, has, expended, fewer, resources, both, in, terms, of, time, and, money, on, children, giving, many, more, money, to, invest, second, since, chinese, adults, would, no, longer, rely, on, children, to, care, for, them, in, their, old, age, there, has, been, an, impetus, to, save, money, for, the, future, as, the, first, generation, of, legally, enforced, only, children, came, of, age, to, become, parents, themselves, one, adult, child, was, left, with, having, to, provide, support, for, his, or, her, two, parents, and, four, grandparents, called, the, 4, 2, 1, problem, this, leaves, the, older, generations, with, increased, chances, of, dependency, on, retirement, funds, or, charity, in, order, to, receive, support, if, not, for, personal, savings, pensions, or, state, welfare, most, senior, citizens, would, be, left, entirely, dependent, upon, their, very, small, family, or, neighbours, for, assistance, if, for, any, reason, the, single, child, is, unable, to, care, for, their, older, adult, relatives, the, oldest, generations, would, face, a, lack, of, resources, and, necessities, in, response, to, such, an, issue, by, 2007, all, provinces, in, the, nation, except, henan, had, adopted, a, new, policy, allowing, couples, to, have, two, children, if, both, parents, were, only, children, themselves, henan, followed, in, 2011, china, s, one, child, policy, had, significant, implications, for, many, aspects, of, chinese, society, including, care, for, elderly, populations, in, gender, and, elder, care, in, china, the, influence, of, filial, piety, and, structural, constraints, authors, zhan, and, montgomery, suggest, that, the, decline, of, traditional, family, support, networks, began, with, the, establishment, of, work, units, in, the, socialist, period, these, collectives, were, meant, to, offer, healthcare, and, housing, to, their, workers, with, the, economic, reforms, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, many, of, the, work, units, dissolved, leaving, many, elderly, workers, without, the, social, support, they, once, had, this, was, exacerbated, by, the, one, child, policy, because, many, families, now, only, had, one, child, to, care, for, elderly, parents, leading, to, increased, pressure, and, responsibility, for, the, sole, caregiver, according, to, a, study, by, gustafson, 2014, the, one, child, policy, has, led, to, a, significant, decrease, in, the, availability, of, family, caregivers, for, the, elderly, in, china, so, tens, of, millions, of, retirees, now, only, have, one, child, to, rely, on, for, care, this, has, led, to, an, inverted, pyramid, in, which, two, sets, of, elderly, parents, must, rely, on, a, single, married, couple, of, two, adult, children, each, of, whom, is, an, only, child, with, no, siblings, who, in, turn, have, produced, a, single, child, on, whom, the, family, must, eventually, rely, on, in, the, next, generation, the, one, child, policy, in, china, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, filial, piety, and, elder, care, filial, piety, is, a, traditional, confucian, value, that, emphasizes, respect, obedience, and, care, for, one, s, parents, and, elders, however, the, one, child, policy, has, led, to, a, smaller, pool, of, potential, caregivers, for, elderly, parents, and, has, also, contributed, to, a, shift, in, attitudes, toward, elder, care, one, study, found, that, the, one, child, policy, has, led, to, a, decline, in, filial, piety, in, china, as, fewer, children, are, responsible, for, caring, for, their, elderly, parents, the, study, also, found, that, the, one, child, policy, has, led, to, a, shift, in, the, responsibility, for, elder, care, from, the, family, to, the, state, for, example, feng, argued, in, 2010, that, the, chinese, government, had, increased, efforts, to, build, residential, elder, care, services, by, actively, promoting, the, construction, of, senior, housing, homes, for, the, aged, and, nursing, homes, this, included, government, sponsored, subsidies, to, spur, construction, and, operation, of, new, facilities, the, virtual, elder, care, home, has, gained, popularity, which, features, home, care, agencies, providing, a, wide, range, of, personal, care, and, homemaker, services, in, elders, homes, services, are, initiated, by, phone, calls, to, a, local, government, sponsored, information, and, service, center, which, then, directs, a, qualified, service, provider, to, the, elder, s, home, participating, providers, contract, with, the, local, government, and, are, reimbursed, for, services, purchased, by, the, government, on, behalf, of, eligible, care, recipients, while, these, programs, are, mainly, centered, in, urban, areas, current, policy, directives, in, rural, areas, favor, institutions, by, encouraging, centralized, support, and, care, in, rural, homes, that, are, run, and, subsidized, by, the, local, government, for, rural, elders, who, do, not, have, the, option, to, turn, to, residential, facilities, many, have, resorted, to, signing, a, family, support, agreement, contract, with, adult, children, to, ensure, needed, support, and, care, furthermore, another, study, found, that, the, one, child, policy, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, quality, of, elder, care, in, china, with, many, elderly, parents, reporting, feeling, neglected, and, abandoned, by, their, adult, children, this, is, due, to, a, lack, of, resources, and, support, from, the, younger, generation, heihaizi, chinese, pinyin, h, ih, izi, or, black, child, is, a, term, denoting, children, born, outside, the, one, child, policy, or, generally, children, who, are, not, registered, in, the, chinese, national, household, registration, system, being, excluded, from, the, family, register, means, they, do, not, possess, a, hukou, which, is, an, identifying, document, similar, in, some, ways, to, the, american, social, security, card, in, this, respect, they, do, not, legally, exist, and, as, a, result, cannot, access, most, public, services, such, as, education, and, health, care, and, do, not, receive, protection, under, the, law, in, urban, areas, especially, a, byproduct, of, the, one, child, policy, has, been, changing, family, dynamics, traditionally, grandparents, had, been, the, focal, point, of, the, family, in, china, they, were, adored, by, all, family, members, and, were, the, ones, who, exercised, decision, making, in, the, day, to, day, life, of, the, family, feng, suggests, that, the, implementation, of, the, one, child, policy, and, the, resulting, numbers, of, one, child, families, have, greatly, reduced, the, multigenerational, family, form, and, has, weakened, the, central, position, of, elders, in, the, family, feng, also, suggests, that, the, one, child, policy, has, caused, parents, to, spend, less, leisure, time, alone, and, more, leisure, time, with, their, children, feng, writes, he, children, tend, to, rely, more, so, on, their, parents, as, companions, and, to, participate, together, in, recreational, activities, he, continues, his, has, promoted, an, equality, in, the, parent, child, relationship, and, has, restricted, to, a, certain, extent, the, interactions, of, children, with, others, in, the, one, child, family, the, core, is, the, parent, child, relationship, and, research, suggests, that, the, husband, wife, relationship, has, been, less, emphasized, and, cultivated, as, a, result, in, china, the, one, child, policy, has, been, associated, with, the, term, little, emperor, which, describes, the, perceived, effects, of, parents, focusing, their, attention, exclusively, on, their, only, child, the, term, gained, popularity, as, a, way, to, suggest, that, only, children, may, become, spoiled, brats, due, to, the, excess, attention, they, receive, from, their, parents, a, study, by, cameron, and, colleagues, explored, this, phenomenon, finding, that, the, one, child, policy, had, behavioral, impacts, on, only, children, the, authors, tested, beijing, youths, born, in, several, birth, cohorts, just, before, and, just, after, the, launch, of, the, one, child, policy, using, economic, games, designed, to, detect, differences, in, desirable, social, behaviors, like, trust, and, altruism, the, study, found, that, only, children, in, china, were, more, likely, to, exhibit, narcissistic, and, selfish, behavior, compared, to, those, with, siblings, the, study, also, found, that, only, children, had, higher, levels, of, academic, achievement, but, lower, levels, of, social, competence, and, empathy, overall, these, findings, suggest, that, the, one, child, policy, had, unintended, social, and, psychological, consequences, that, may, have, lasting, effects, on, chinese, society, as, a, whole, other, scholarship, supports, that, the, little, emperor, phenomenon, does, exist, jiao, and, colleagues, compared, children, between, the, ages, of, four, and, ten, from, urban, and, suburban, areas, of, beijing, using, peer, ratings, of, cooperativeness, leadership, and, other, desirable, traits, when, they, analyzed, a, matched, sample, of, only, children, and, children, with, siblings, from, similar, backgrounds, they, reported, constant, patterns, in, which, the, only, children, were, rated, less, positively, however, researchers, chen, and, jin, outline, some, of, the, arguably, positive, byproducts, of, this, little, emperor, phenomenon, they, suggest, that, since, only, children, receive, more, attention, and, resources, from, their, parents, it, can, lead, to, improved, academic, performance, and, overall, success, in, life, with, the, first, generation, of, children, born, under, the, policy, which, initially, became, a, requirement, for, most, couples, with, first, children, born, starting, in, 1979, and, extending, into, the, 1980s, reaching, adulthood, such, worries, were, reduced, toni, falbo, a, professor, of, educational, psychology, and, sociology, at, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, came, to, the, conclusion, that, no, measurable, differences, exist, in, terms, of, sociability, and, characterization, between, singleton, children, and, multi, sibling, children, except, that, single, children, scored, higher, on, intelligence, and, achievement, due, to, a, lack, of, dilution, of, resources, some, 30, delegates, called, on, the, government, in, the, chinese, people, s, political, consultative, conference, in, march, 2007, to, abolish, the, one, child, rule, citing, social, problems, and, personality, disorders, in, young, people, one, statement, read, it, is, not, healthy, for, children, to, play, only, with, their, parents, and, be, spoiled, by, them, it, is, not, right, to, limit, the, number, to, two, children, per, family, either, the, proposal, was, prepared, by, ye, tingfang, a, professor, at, the, chinese, academy, of, social, sciences, who, suggested, that, the, government, at, least, restore, the, previous, rule, that, allowed, couples, to, have, up, to, two, children, according, to, a, scholar, the, one, child, limit, is, too, extreme, it, violates, nature, s, law, and, in, the, long, run, this, will, lead, to, mother, nature, s, revenge, reports, surfaced, of, chinese, women, giving, birth, to, their, second, child, overseas, a, practice, known, as, birth, tourism, many, went, to, hong, kong, which, is, exempt, from, the, one, child, policy, likewise, a, hong, kong, passport, differs, from, china, s, mainland, passport, by, providing, additional, advantages, recently, though, the, hong, kong, government, has, drastically, reduced, the, quota, of, births, set, for, non, local, women, in, public, hospitals, as, the, united, states, practices, birthright, citizenship, all, children, born, in, the, us, automatically, have, us, citizenship, at, birth, the, closest, us, location, from, china, is, saipan, in, the, northern, mariana, islands, a, us, dependency, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, that, generally, allows, chinese, citizens, to, visit, for, 14, days, without, requiring, a, visa, as, of, 2012, the, northern, mariana, islands, were, experiencing, an, increase, in, births, by, chinese, citizens, because, birth, tourism, there, had, become, cheaper, than, in, hong, kong, this, option, is, used, by, relatively, affluent, chinese, who, may, want, their, children, to, have, the, option, of, living, in, the, us, as, adults, due, to, the, preference, in, rural, chinese, society, to, give, birth, to, a, son, prenatal, sex, discernment, and, sex, selective, abortions, are, illegal, in, china, it, is, often, argued, as, one, of, the, key, factors, in, the, imbalanced, sex, ratio, in, china, as, excess, female, infant, mortality, and, under, reporting, of, female, births, cannot, solely, explain, this, gender, disparity, researchers, found, that, the, gender, of, the, firstborn, child, in, rural, parts, of, china, impacted, whether, or, not, the, mother, would, seek, an, ultrasound, for, the, second, child, 40, of, women, with, a, firstborn, son, sought, an, ultrasound, for, their, second, pregnancy, versus, 70, of, women, with, firstborn, daughters, this, represented, a, desire, for, women, to, have, a, son, if, one, had, not, yet, been, born, in, response, to, this, the, chinese, government, made, sex, selective, abortions, illegal, in, 2005, in, china, male, children, have, always, been, favored, over, female, children, with, the, one, child, policy, in, place, many, parents, often, chose, abortions, to, meet, the, one, child, standard, as, well, as, for, the, satisfaction, of, having, a, male, son, male, offspring, were, preferred, in, rural, areas, to, ensure, parents, security, in, their, old, age, since, daughters, were, expected, to, marry, and, support, their, husbands, family, a, common, saying, in, rural, areas, was, yang, er, fang, lao, which, translates, to, rear, a, son, for, your, old, age, after, the, initial, forced, sterilization, and, abortion, campaign, in, 1983, citizens, of, urban, areas, in, china, disagreed, with, the, standards, being, placed, on, them, by, the, government, and, having, complete, disregard, for, basic, human, rights, this, led, to, the, chinese, government, straying, away, from, the, forced, sterilization, processes, in, attempts, to, encourage, civilian, compliance, the, one, child, policy, has, been, a, factor, behind, china, s, high, urban, household, savings, rate, 59, the, policy, was, controversial, outside, china, for, many, reasons, including, accusations, of, human, rights, abuses, in, the, implementation, of, the, policy, as, well, as, concerns, about, negative, social, consequences, the, chinese, government, quoting, zhai, zhenwu, director, of, renmin, university, s, school, of, sociology, and, population, in, beijing, estimates, that, 400, million, births, were, prevented, by, the, one, child, policy, as, of, 2011, while, some, demographers, challenge, that, number, putting, the, figure, at, perhaps, half, that, level, according, to, cnn, zhai, clarified, that, the, 400, million, estimate, referred, not, just, to, the, one, child, policy, but, includes, births, prevented, by, predecessor, policies, implemented, one, decade, before, stating, that, there, are, many, different, numbers, out, there, but, it, doesn, t, change, the, basic, fact, that, the, policy, prevented, a, really, large, number, of, births, this, claim, is, disputed, by, wang, feng, director, of, the, brookings, tsinghua, center, for, public, policy, and, cai, yong, from, the, carolina, population, center, at, the, university, of, north, carolina, at, chapel, hill, wang, argues, that, thailand, and, china, have, had, almost, identical, fertility, trajectories, since, the, mid, 1980s, and, thailand, does, not, have, a, one, child, policy, china, s, health, ministry, has, also, disclosed, that, at, least, 336, million, abortions, were, performed, on, account, of, the, policy, according, to, a, report, by, the, us, embassy, scholarship, published, by, chinese, scholars, and, their, presentations, at, the, october, 1997, beijing, conference, of, the, international, union, for, the, scientific, study, of, population, seemed, to, suggest, that, market, based, incentives, or, increasing, voluntariness, is, not, morally, better, but, that, it, is, in, the, end, more, effective, in, 1988, zeng, yi, and, professor, t, paul, schultz, of, yale, university, discussed, the, effect, of, the, transformation, to, the, market, on, chinese, fertility, arguing, that, the, introduction, of, the, contract, responsibility, system, in, agriculture, during, the, early, 1980s, weakened, family, planning, controls, during, that, period, zeng, contended, that, the, big, cooking, pot, system, of, the, people, s, communes, had, insulated, people, from, the, costs, of, having, many, children, by, the, late, 1980s, economic, costs, and, incentives, created, by, the, contract, system, were, already, reducing, the, number, of, children, farmers, wanted, a, long, term, experiment, in, a, county, in, shanxi, in, which, the, family, planning, law, was, suspended, suggested, that, families, would, not, have, many, more, children, even, if, the, law, were, abolished, a, 2003, review, of, the, policy, making, process, behind, the, adoption, of, the, one, child, policy, shows, that, less, intrusive, options, including, those, that, emphasized, delay, and, spacing, of, births, were, known, but, not, fully, considered, by, china, s, political, leaders, corrupted, government, officials, and, especially, wealthy, individuals, have, often, been, able, to, violate, the, policy, in, spite, of, fines, filmmaker, zhang, yimou, had, three, children, and, was, subsequently, fined, 7, 48, million, yuan, 1, 2, million, for, example, between, 2000, and, 2005, as, many, as, 1, 968, officials, in, hunan,

and, calling, on, local, officials, to, expose, the, celebrities, and, high, income, people, who, violate, the, family, planning, policy, and, have, more, than, one, child, also, people, who, lived, in, the, rural, areas, of, china, were, allowed, to, have, two, children, without, punishment, although, the, family, is, required, to, wait, a, couple, of, years, before, having, another, child, the, one, child, policy, had, been, challenged, for, violating, a, human, right, to, determine, the, size, of, one, s, own, proper, family, according, to, a, 1968, proclamation, of, the, international, conference, on, human, rights, parents, have, a, basic, human, right, to, determine, freely, and, responsibly, the, number, and, the, spacing, of, their, children, according, to, the, uk, newspaper,
