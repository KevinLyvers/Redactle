swedish, endonym, svenska, is, a, north, germanic, language, from, the, indo, european, language, family, spoken, predominantly, in, sweden, and, parts, of, finland, it, has, at, least, 10, million, native, speakers, making, it, the, fourth, most, spoken, germanic, language, and, the, first, among, its, type, in, the, nordic, countries, overall, swedish, like, the, other, nordic, languages, is, a, descendant, of, old, norse, the, common, language, of, the, germanic, peoples, living, in, scandinavia, during, the, viking, age, it, is, largely, mutually, intelligible, with, norwegian, and, danish, although, the, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, is, dependent, on, the, dialect, and, accent, of, the, speaker, standard, swedish, spoken, by, most, swedes, is, the, national, language, that, evolved, from, the, central, swedish, dialects, in, the, 19th, century, and, was, well, established, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, while, distinct, regional, varieties, and, rural, dialects, still, exist, the, written, language, is, uniform, and, standardized, swedish, is, the, most, widely, spoken, second, language, in, finland, where, its, status, is, co, official, language, swedish, was, long, spoken, in, parts, of, estonia, although, the, current, status, of, the, estonian, swedish, speakers, is, almost, extinct, it, is, also, used, in, the, swedish, diaspora, most, notably, in, oslo, norway, with, more, than, 50, 000, swedish, residents, swedish, is, an, indo, european, language, belonging, to, the, north, germanic, branch, of, the, germanic, languages, in, the, established, classification, it, belongs, to, the, east, scandinavian, languages, together, with, danish, separating, it, from, the, west, scandinavian, languages, consisting, of, faroese, icelandic, and, norwegian, however, more, recent, analyses, divide, the, north, germanic, languages, into, two, groups, insular, scandinavian, faroese, and, icelandic, and, continental, scandinavian, danish, norwegian, and, swedish, based, on, mutual, intelligibility, due, to, heavy, influence, of, east, scandinavian, particularly, danish, on, norwegian, during, the, last, millennium, and, divergence, from, both, faroese, and, icelandic, by, many, general, criteria, of, mutual, intelligibility, the, continental, scandinavian, languages, could, very, well, be, considered, dialects, of, a, common, scandinavian, language, however, because, of, several, hundred, years, of, sometimes, quite, intense, rivalry, between, denmark, and, sweden, including, a, long, series, of, wars, from, the, 16th, to, 18th, centuries, and, the, nationalist, ideas, that, emerged, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, languages, have, separate, orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and, regulatory, bodies, danish, norwegian, and, swedish, are, thus, from, a, linguistic, perspective, more, accurately, described, as, a, dialect, continuum, of, scandinavian, north, germanic, and, some, of, the, dialects, such, as, those, on, the, border, between, norway, and, sweden, especially, parts, of, bohusl, n, dalsland, western, v, rmland, western, dalarna, h, rjedalen, j, mtland, and, scania, could, be, described, as, intermediate, dialects, of, the, national, standard, languages, swedish, pronunciations, also, vary, greatly, from, one, region, to, another, a, legacy, of, the, vast, geographic, distances, and, historical, isolation, even, so, the, vocabulary, is, standardized, to, a, level, that, make, dialects, within, sweden, virtually, fully, mutually, intelligible, east, germanic, languages, west, germanic, languages, icelandic, faroese, norwegian, danish, swedish, in, the, 8th, century, the, common, germanic, language, of, scandinavia, proto, norse, evolved, into, old, norse, this, language, underwent, more, changes, that, did, not, spread, to, all, of, scandinavia, which, resulted, in, the, appearance, of, two, similar, dialects, old, west, norse, norway, the, faroe, islands, and, iceland, and, old, east, norse, denmark, and, sweden, the, dialects, of, old, east, norse, spoken, in, sweden, are, called, runic, swedish, while, the, dialects, of, denmark, are, referred, to, as, runic, danish, the, dialects, are, described, as, runic, because, the, main, body, of, text, appears, in, the, runic, alphabet, unlike, proto, norse, which, was, written, with, the, elder, futhark, alphabet, old, norse, was, written, with, the, younger, futhark, alphabet, which, had, only, 16, letters, because, the, number, of, runes, was, limited, some, runes, were, used, for, a, range, of, phonemes, such, as, the, rune, for, the, vowel, u, which, was, also, used, for, the, vowels, o, and, y, and, the, rune, for, i, also, used, for, e, from, 1200, onwards, the, dialects, in, denmark, began, to, diverge, from, those, of, sweden, the, innovations, spread, unevenly, from, denmark, creating, a, series, of, minor, dialectal, boundaries, or, isoglosses, ranging, from, zealand, in, the, south, to, norrland, sterbotten, and, northwestern, finland, in, the, north, an, early, change, that, separated, runic, danish, from, the, other, dialects, of, old, east, norse, was, the, change, of, the, diphthong, i, to, the, monophthong, as, in, st, inn, to, st, nn, stone, this, is, reflected, in, runic, inscriptions, where, the, older, read, stain, and, the, later, stin, there, was, also, a, change, of, au, as, in, dau, r, into, a, long, open, as, in, d, r, dead, this, change, is, shown, in, runic, inscriptions, as, a, change, from, tau, r, into, tu, r, moreover, the, y, diphthong, changed, into, a, long, close, as, in, the, old, norse, word, for, island, by, the, end, of, the, period, these, innovations, had, affected, most, of, the, runic, swedish, speaking, area, as, well, with, the, exception, of, the, dialects, spoken, north, and, east, of, m, lardalen, where, the, diphthongs, still, exist, in, remote, areas, old, swedish, swedish, fornsvenska, is, the, term, used, for, the, medieval, swedish, language, the, start, date, is, usually, set, to, 1225, since, this, is, the, year, that, v, stg, talagen, the, v, stg, ta, law, is, believed, to, have, been, compiled, for, the, first, time, it, is, among, the, most, important, documents, of, the, period, written, in, latin, script, and, the, oldest, swedish, law, codes, old, swedish, is, divided, into, ldre, fornsvenska, 1225, 1375, and, yngre, fornsvenska, 1375, 1526, older, and, younger, old, swedish, important, outside, influences, during, this, time, came, with, the, firm, establishment, of, the, christian, church, and, various, monastic, orders, introducing, many, greek, and, latin, loanwords, with, the, rise, of, hanseatic, power, in, the, late, 13th, and, early, 14th, century, middle, low, german, became, very, influential, the, hanseatic, league, provided, swedish, commerce, and, administration, with, a, large, number, of, low, german, speaking, immigrants, many, became, quite, influential, members, of, swedish, medieval, society, and, brought, terms, from, their, native, languages, into, the, vocabulary, besides, a, great, number, of, loanwords, for, such, areas, as, warfare, trade, and, administration, general, grammatical, suffixes, and, even, conjunctions, were, imported, the, league, also, brought, a, certain, measure, of, influence, from, danish, at, the, time, swedish, and, danish, were, much, more, similar, than, today, early, old, swedish, was, markedly, different, from, the, modern, language, in, that, it, had, a, more, complex, case, structure, and, also, retained, the, original, germanic, three, gender, system, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and, certain, numerals, were, inflected, in, four, cases, besides, the, extant, nominative, there, were, also, the, genitive, later, possessive, dative, and, accusative, the, gender, system, resembled, that, of, modern, german, having, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, genders, the, masculine, and, feminine, genders, were, later, merged, into, a, common, gender, with, the, definite, suffix, en, and, the, definite, article, den, in, contrast, with, the, neuter, gender, equivalents, et, and, det, the, verb, system, was, also, more, complex, it, included, subjunctive, and, imperative, moods, and, verbs, were, conjugated, according, to, person, as, well, as, number, by, the, 16th, century, the, case, and, gender, systems, of, the, colloquial, spoken, language, and, the, profane, literature, had, been, largely, reduced, to, the, two, cases, and, two, genders, of, modern, swedish, a, transitional, change, of, the, latin, script, in, the, nordic, countries, was, to, spell, the, letter, combination, ae, as, and, sometimes, as, a, though, it, varied, between, persons, and, regions, the, combination, ao, was, similarly, rendered, a, o, and, oe, became, o, e, these, three, were, later, to, evolve, into, the, separate, letters, and, the, first, time, the, new, letters, were, used, in, print, was, in, aff, dy, ffwlsens, fr, stilse, by, the, devil, s, temptation, published, by, johan, gerson, in, 1495, modern, swedish, swedish, nysvenska, begins, with, the, advent, of, the, printing, press, and, the, european, reformation, after, assuming, power, the, new, monarch, gustav, vasa, ordered, a, swedish, translation, of, the, bible, the, new, testament, was, published, in, 1526, followed, by, a, full, bible, translation, in, 1541, usually, referred, to, as, the, gustav, vasa, bible, a, translation, deemed, so, successful, and, influential, that, with, revisions, incorporated, in, successive, editions, it, remained, the, most, common, bible, translation, until, 1917, the, main, translators, were, laurentius, andre, and, the, brothers, laurentius, and, olaus, petri, the, vasa, bible, is, often, considered, to, be, a, reasonable, compromise, between, old, and, new, while, not, adhering, to, the, colloquial, spoken, language, of, its, day, it, was, not, overly, conservative, in, its, use, of, archaic, forms, it, was, a, major, step, towards, a, more, consistent, swedish, orthography, it, established, the, use, of, the, vowels, and, and, the, spelling, ck, in, place, of, kk, distinguishing, it, clearly, from, the, danish, bible, perhaps, intentionally, given, the, ongoing, rivalry, between, the, countries, all, three, translators, came, from, central, sweden, which, is, generally, seen, as, adding, specific, central, swedish, features, to, the, new, bible, though, it, might, seem, as, if, the, bible, translation, set, a, very, powerful, precedent, for, orthographic, standards, spelling, actually, became, more, inconsistent, during, the, remainder, of, the, century, it, was, not, until, the, 17th, century, that, spelling, began, to, be, discussed, around, the, time, when, the, first, grammars, were, written, capitalization, during, this, time, was, not, standardized, it, depended, on, the, authors, and, their, background, those, influenced, by, german, capitalized, all, nouns, while, others, capitalized, more, sparsely, it, is, also, not, always, apparent, which, letters, are, capitalized, owing, to, the, gothic, or, blackletter, typeface, that, was, used, to, print, the, bible, this, typeface, was, in, use, until, the, mid, 18th, century, when, it, was, gradually, replaced, with, a, latin, typeface, often, antiqua, some, important, changes, in, sound, during, the, modern, swedish, period, were, the, gradual, assimilation, of, several, different, consonant, clusters, into, the, fricative, and, later, into, there, was, also, the, gradual, softening, of, and, into, and, the, fricative, before, front, vowels, the, velar, fricative, was, also, transformed, into, the, corresponding, plosive, the, period, that, includes, swedish, as, it, is, spoken, today, is, termed, nusvenska, lit, now, swedish, in, linguistics, and, started, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 19th, century, it, saw, a, democratization, of, the, language, with, a, less, formal, written, form, that, approached, the, spoken, one, the, growth, of, a, public, school, system, also, led, to, the, evolution, of, so, called, boksvenska, literally, book, swedish, especially, among, the, working, classes, where, spelling, to, some, extent, influenced, pronunciation, particularly, in, official, contexts, with, the, industrialization, and, urbanization, of, sweden, well, under, way, by, the, last, decades, of, the, 19th, century, a, new, breed, of, authors, made, their, mark, on, swedish, literature, many, scholars, politicians, and, other, public, figures, had, a, great, influence, on, the, emerging, national, language, among, them, prolific, authors, like, the, poet, gustaf, fr, ding, nobel, laureate, selma, lagerl, f, and, radical, writer, and, playwright, august, strindberg, it, was, during, the, 20th, century, that, a, common, standardized, national, language, became, available, to, all, swedes, the, orthography, finally, stabilized, and, became, almost, completely, uniform, with, some, minor, deviations, by, the, time, of, the, spelling, reform, of, 1906, with, the, exception, of, plural, forms, of, verbs, and, a, slightly, different, syntax, particularly, in, the, written, language, the, language, was, the, same, as, the, swedish, of, today, the, plural, verb, forms, appeared, decreasingly, in, formal, writing, into, the, 1950s, when, their, use, was, removed, from, all, official, recommendations, a, very, significant, change, in, swedish, occurred, in, the, late, 1960s, with, the, so, called, du, reformen, the, you, reform, previously, the, proper, way, to, address, people, of, the, same, or, higher, social, status, had, been, by, title, and, surname, the, use, of, herr, mr, or, sir, fru, mrs, or, ma, am, or, fr, ken, miss, was, considered, the, only, acceptable, way, to, begin, conversation, with, strangers, of, unknown, occupation, academic, title, or, military, rank, the, fact, that, the, listener, should, preferably, be, referred, to, in, the, third, person, tended, to, further, complicate, spoken, communication, between, members, of, society, in, the, early, 20th, century, an, unsuccessful, attempt, was, made, to, replace, the, insistence, on, titles, with, ni, the, standard, second, person, plural, pronoun, analogous, to, the, french, vous, see, t, v, distinction, ni, wound, up, being, used, as, a, slightly, less, familiar, form, of, du, the, singular, second, person, pronoun, used, to, address, people, of, lower, social, status, with, the, liberalization, and, radicalization, of, swedish, society, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, these, class, distinctions, became, less, important, and, du, became, the, standard, even, in, formal, and, official, contexts, though, the, reform, was, not, an, act, of, any, centralized, political, decree, but, rather, the, result, of, sweeping, change, in, social, attitudes, it, was, completed, in, just, a, few, years, from, the, late, 1960s, to, early, 1970s, the, use, of, ni, as, a, polite, form, of, address, is, sometimes, encountered, today, in, both, the, written, and, spoken, language, particularly, among, older, speakers, swedish, is, the, sole, official, national, language, of, sweden, and, one, of, two, in, finland, alongside, finnish, as, of, 2006, it, was, the, sole, native, language, of, 83, of, swedish, residents, in, 2007, around, 5, 5, c, 290, 000, of, the, population, of, finland, were, native, speakers, of, swedish, partially, due, to, a, decline, following, the, russian, annexation, of, finland, after, the, finnish, war, 1808, 1809, the, fenno, swedish, speaking, minority, is, concentrated, in, the, coastal, areas, and, archipelagos, of, southern, and, western, finland, in, some, of, these, areas, swedish, is, the, predominant, language, in, 19, municipalities, 16, of, which, are, located, in, land, swedish, is, the, sole, official, language, land, county, is, an, autonomous, region, of, finland, according, to, a, rough, estimation, as, of, 2010, there, were, up, to, 300, 000, swedish, speakers, living, outside, sweden, and, finland, the, largest, populations, were, in, the, united, states, up, to, 100, 000, the, uk, spain, and, germany, c, 30, 000, each, and, a, large, proportion, of, the, remaining, 100, 000, in, the, scandinavian, countries, france, switzerland, belgium, the, netherlands, canada, and, australia, over, three, million, people, speak, swedish, as, a, second, language, with, about, 2, 410, 000, of, those, in, finland, according, to, a, survey, by, the, european, commission, 44, of, respondents, from, finland, who, did, not, have, swedish, as, a, native, language, considered, themselves, to, be, proficient, enough, in, swedish, to, hold, a, conversation, due, to, the, close, relation, between, the, scandinavian, languages, a, considerable, proportion, of, speakers, of, danish, and, especially, norwegian, are, able, to, understand, swedish, there, is, considerable, migration, between, the, nordic, countries, but, owing, to, the, similarity, between, the, cultures, and, languages, with, the, exception, of, finnish, expatriates, generally, assimilate, quickly, and, do, not, stand, out, as, a, group, according, to, the, 2000, united, states, census, some, 67, 000, people, over, the, age, of, five, were, reported, as, swedish, speakers, though, without, any, information, on, the, degree, of, language, proficiency, similarly, there, were, 16, 915, reported, swedish, speakers, in, canada, from, the, 2001, census, although, there, are, no, certain, numbers, some, 40, 000, swedes, are, estimated, to, live, in, the, london, area, in, the, united, kingdom, outside, sweden, and, finland, there, are, about, 40, 000, active, learners, enrolled, in, swedish, language, courses, in, the, united, states, particularly, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, there, was, a, significant, swedish, speaking, immigrant, population, this, was, notably, true, in, states, like, minnesota, where, many, swedish, immigrants, settled, by, 1940, approximately, 6, of, minnesota, s, population, spoke, swedish, although, the, use, of, swedish, has, significantly, declined, it, is, not, uncommon, to, find, older, generations, and, communities, that, still, retain, some, use, and, knowledge, of, the, language, particularly, in, rural, communities, like, lindstr, m, and, scandia, swedish, is, the, official, main, language, of, sweden, swedish, is, also, one, of, two, official, languages, of, finland, in, sweden, it, has, long, been, used, in, local, and, state, government, and, most, of, the, educational, system, but, remained, only, a, de, facto, primary, language, with, no, official, status, in, law, until, 2009, a, bill, was, proposed, in, 2005, that, would, have, made, swedish, an, official, language, but, failed, to, pass, by, the, narrowest, possible, margin, 145, 147, due, to, a, pairing, off, failure, a, proposal, for, a, broader, language, law, designating, swedish, as, the, main, language, of, the, country, and, bolstering, the, status, of, the, minority, languages, was, submitted, by, an, expert, committee, to, the, swedish, ministry, of, culture, in, march, 2008, it, was, subsequently, enacted, by, the, riksdag, and, entered, into, effect, on, 1, july, 2009, swedish, is, the, sole, official, language, of, land, an, autonomous, province, under, the, sovereignty, of, finland, where, the, vast, majority, of, the, 26, 000, inhabitants, speak, swedish, as, a, first, language, in, finland, as, a, whole, swedish, is, one, of, the, two, national, languages, with, the, same, official, status, as, finnish, spoken, by, the, majority, at, the, state, level, and, an, official, language, in, some, municipalities, swedish, is, one, of, the, official, languages, of, the, european, union, and, one, of, the, working, languages, of, the, nordic, council, under, the, nordic, language, convention, citizens, of, the, nordic, countries, speaking, swedish, have, the, opportunity, to, use, their, native, language, when, interacting, with, official, bodies, in, other, nordic, countries, without, being, liable, for, interpretation, or, translation, costs, the, swedish, language, council, spr, kr, det, is, the, regulator, of, swedish, in, sweden, but, does, not, attempt, to, enforce, control, of, the, language, as, for, instance, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, does, for, french, however, many, organizations, and, agencies, require, the, use, of, the, council, s, publication, svenska, skrivregler, in, official, contexts, with, it, otherwise, being, regarded, as, a, de, facto, orthographic, standard, among, the, many, organizations, that, make, up, the, swedish, language, council, the, swedish, academy, established, 1786, is, arguably, the, most, influential, its, primary, instruments, are, the, spelling, dictionary, svenska, akademiens, ordlista, saol, currently, in, its, 14th, edition, and, the, dictionary, svenska, akademiens, ordbok, in, addition, to, various, books, on, grammar, spelling, and, manuals, of, style, although, the, dictionaries, have, a, prescriptive, element, they, mainly, describe, current, usage, in, finland, a, special, branch, of, the, research, institute, for, the, languages, of, finland, has, official, status, as, the, regulatory, body, for, swedish, in, finland, among, its, highest, priorities, is, to, maintain, intelligibility, with, the, language, spoken, in, sweden, it, has, published, finlandssvensk, ordbok, a, dictionary, about, the, differences, between, swedish, in, finland, and, sweden, from, the, 13th, to, 20th, century, there, were, swedish, speaking, communities, in, estonia, particularly, on, the, islands, e, g, hiiumaa, vormsi, ruhnu, in, swedish, known, as, dag, orms, run, respectively, along, the, coast, of, the, baltic, communities, that, today, have, all, disappeared, the, swedish, speaking, minority, was, represented, in, parliament, and, entitled, to, use, their, native, language, in, parliamentary, debates, after, the, loss, of, estonia, to, the, russian, empire, in, the, early, 18th, century, around, 1, 000, estonian, swedish, speakers, were, forced, to, march, to, southern, ukraine, where, they, founded, a, village, gammalsvenskby, old, swedish, village, a, few, elderly, people, in, the, village, still, speak, a, swedish, dialect, and, observe, the, holidays, of, the, swedish, calendar, although, their, dialect, is, most, likely, facing, extinction, from, 1918, to, 1940, when, estonia, was, independent, the, small, swedish, community, was, well, treated, municipalities, with, a, swedish, majority, mainly, found, along, the, coast, used, swedish, as, the, administrative, language, and, swedish, estonian, culture, saw, an, upswing, however, most, swedish, speaking, people, fled, to, sweden, before, the, end, of, world, war, ii, that, is, before, the, invasion, of, estonia, by, the, soviet, army, in, 1944, only, a, handful, of, speakers, remain, swedish, dialects, have, either, 17, or, 18, vowel, phonemes, 9, long, and, 9, short, as, in, the, other, germanic, languages, including, english, most, long, vowels, are, phonetically, paired, with, one, of, the, short, vowels, and, the, pairs, are, such, that, the, two, vowels, are, of, similar, quality, but, with, the, short, vowel, being, slightly, lower, and, slightly, centralized, in, contrast, to, e, g, danish, which, has, only, tense, vowels, the, short, vowels, are, slightly, more, lax, but, the, tense, vs, lax, contrast, is, not, nearly, as, pronounced, as, in, english, german, or, dutch, in, many, dialects, the, short, vowel, sound, pronounced, or, has, merged, with, the, short, e, transcribed, in, the, chart, below, there, are, 18, consonant, phonemes, two, of, which, and, r, vary, considerably, in, pronunciation, depending, on, the, dialect, and, social, status, of, the, speaker, in, many, dialects, sequences, of, r, pronounced, alveolarly, with, a, dental, consonant, result, in, retroflex, consonants, alveolarity, of, the, pronunciation, of, r, is, a, precondition, for, this, retroflexion, r, has, a, guttural, or, french, r, pronunciation, in, the, south, swedish, dialects, consequently, these, dialects, lack, retroflex, consonants, swedish, is, a, stress, timed, language, where, the, time, intervals, between, stressed, syllables, are, equal, however, when, casually, spoken, it, tends, to, be, syllable, timed, any, stressed, syllable, carries, one, of, two, tones, which, gives, swedish, much, of, its, characteristic, sound, prosody, is, often, one, of, the, most, noticeable, differences, between, dialects, the, standard, word, order, is, as, in, most, germanic, languages, v2, which, means, that, the, finite, verb, v, appears, in, the, second, position, 2, of, a, declarative, main, clause, swedish, morphology, is, similar, to, english, that, is, words, have, comparatively, few, inflections, swedish, has, two, genders, and, is, generally, seen, to, have, two, grammatical, cases, nominative, and, genitive, except, for, pronouns, that, as, in, english, also, are, inflected, in, the, object, form, although, it, is, debated, if, the, genitive, in, swedish, should, be, seen, as, a, genitive, case, or, just, the, nominative, plus, the, so, called, genitive, s, then, seen, as, a, clitic, swedish, has, two, grammatical, numbers, plural, and, singular, adjectives, have, discrete, comparative, and, superlative, forms, and, are, also, inflected, according, to, gender, number, and, definiteness, the, definiteness, of, nouns, is, marked, primarily, through, suffixes, endings, complemented, with, separate, definite, and, indefinite, articles, the, prosody, features, both, stress, and, in, most, dialects, tonal, qualities, the,

english, besides, the, two, natural, genders, han, and, hon, he, and, she, there, are, also, the, two, grammatical, genders, den, and, det, usually, termed, common, and, neuter, in, recent, years, a, gender, neutral, pronoun, hen, has, been, introduced, particularly, in, literary, swedish, unlike, the, nouns, pronouns, have, an, additional, object, form, derived, from, the, old, dative, form, hon, for, example, has, the, following, nominative, possessive, and, object, forms, swedish, also, uses, third, person, possessive, reflexive, pronouns, that, refer, to, the, subject, in, a, clause, a, trait, that, is, restricted, to, north, germanic, languages, swedish, used, to, have, a, genitive, that, was, placed, at, the, end, of, the, head, of, a, noun, phrase, in, modern, swedish, it, has, become, an, enclitic, s, which, attaches, to, the, end, of, the, noun, phrase, rather, than, the, noun, itself, in, formal, written, language, it, used, to, be, considered, correct, to, place, the,

identical, to, the, infinitive, form, perfect, and, present, participles, as, adjectival, verbs, are, very, common, in, contrast, to, english, and, many, other, languages, swedish, does, not, use, the, perfect, participle, to, form, the, present, perfect, and, past, perfect, rather, the, auxiliary, verb, har, have, hade, had, is, followed, by, a, special, form, called, the, supine, used, solely, for, this, purpose, although, often, identical, to, the, neuter, form, of, the, perfect, participle, when, building, the, compound, passive, voice, using, the, verb, att, bli, the, past,

optional, and, often, omitted, particularly, in, written, swedish, subjunctive, mood, is, occasionally, used, for, some, verbs, but, its, use, is, in, sharp, decline, and, few, speakers, perceive, the, handful, of, commonly, used, verbs, as, for, instance, vore, m, nne, as, separate, conjugations, most, of, them, remaining, only, as, set, of, idiomatic, expressions, where, other, languages, may, use, grammatical, cases, swedish, uses, numerous, prepositions, similar, to, those, found, in, english, as, in, modern, german, prepositions, formerly, determined, case, in, swedish, but, this, feature, can, only, be, found, in, certain, idiomatic, expressions, like, till, fots, on, foot, genitive, as, swedish, is, a, germanic, language, the, syntax, shows, similarities, to, both, english, and, german, like, english, swedish, has, a, subject, verb, object, basic, word, order, but, like, german, it, utilizes, verb, second, word, order, in, main, clauses, for, instance, after, adverbs, and, adverbial, phrases, and, dependent, clauses, adverbial, phrases, denoting, time, are, usually, placed, at, the, beginning, of, a, main, clause, that, is, at, the, head, of, a, sentence, prepositional, phrases, are, placed, in, a, place, manner, time, order, as, in, english, but, not, german, adjectives, precede, the, noun, they, modify, verb, second, inverted, word, order, is, also, used, for, questions, the, vocabulary, of, swedish, is, mainly, germanic, either, through, common, germanic, heritage, or, through, loans, from, german, middle, low, german, and, to, some, extent, english, examples, of, germanic, words, in, swedish, are, mus, mouse, kung, king, and, g, s, goose, a, significant, part, of, the, religious, and, scientific, vocabulary, is, of, latin, or, greek, origin, often, borrowed, from, french, and, lately, english, some, 1, 200, words, are, also, borrowed, from, scandoromani, or, romani, often, as, slang, varieties, a, commonly, used, word, from, romani, is, tjej, girl, a, large, number, of, french, words, were, imported, into, sweden, around, the, 18th, century, these, words, have, been, transcribed, to, the, swedish, spelling, system, and, are, therefore, pronounced, recognizably, to, a, french, speaker, most, of, them, are, distinguished, by, a, french, accent, characterized, by, emphasis, on, the, last, syllable, for, example, niv, fr, niveau, level, f, t, lj, fr, fauteuil, armchair, and, aff, r, shop, affair, etc, cross, borrowing, from, other, germanic, languages, has, also, been, common, at, first, from, middle, low, german, the, lingua, franca, of, the, hanseatic, league, and, later, from, standard, german, some, compounds, are, translations, of, the, elements, calques, of, german, original, compounds, into, swedish, like, bomull, from, german, baumwolle, cotton, literally, tree, wool, as, with, many, germanic, languages, new, words, can, be, formed, by, compounding, e, g, nouns, like, nagellackborttagningsmedel, nail, polish, remover, or, verbs, like, smyglyssna, to, eavesdrop, compound, nouns, take, their, gender, from, the, head, which, in, swedish, is, always, the, last, morpheme, new, words, can, also, be, coined, by, derivation, from, other, established, words, such, as, the, verbification, of, nouns, by, the, adding, of, the, suffix, a, as, in, bil, car, and, bila, travel, recreationally, by, car, the, opposite, making, nouns, of, verbs, is, also, possible, as, in, t, nk, way, of, thinking, concept, from, t, nka, to, think, the, swedish, alphabet, is, a, 29, letter, alphabet, using, the, 26,

though, these, combinations, are, historically, modified, versions, of, a, and, o, according, to, the, english, range, of, usage, for, the, term, diacritic, these, three, characters, are, not, considered, to, be, diacritics, within, the, swedish, application, but, rather, separate, letters, and, are, independent, letters, following, z, before, the, release, of, the, 13th, edition, of, svenska, akademiens, ordlista, in, april, 2006, w, was, treated, as, merely, a, variant, of, v, used, only, in, names, such, as, wallenberg, and, foreign, words, bowling, and, so, was, both, sorted, and, pronounced, as, a, v, other, diacritics, to, use, the, broader, english, term, usage, referenced, here, are, unusual, in, swedish, is, sometimes, used, to, indicate, that, the, stress, falls, on, a, terminal, syllable, containing, e, especially, when, the, stress, changes, the, meaning, ide, vs, id, winter, lair, vs, idea, as, well, as, in, some, names, like, kastr, n, occasionally, other, acute, accents, and, less, often, grave, accents, can, be, seen, in, names, and, some, foreign, words, the, letter, is, used, to, refer, to, unit, cost, a, loan, from, the, french, equivalent, to,

exceptionally, be, seen, in, elaborated, style, for, instance, a, da, the, german, convention, of, writing, and, as, ae, and, oe, if, the, characters, are, unavailable, is, an, unusual, convention, for, speakers, of, modern, swedish, despite, the, availability, of, all, these, characters, in, the, swedish, national, top, level, internet, domain, and, other, such, domains, swedish, sites, are, frequently, labelled, using, a, and, o, based, on, visual, similarity, though, swedish, domains, could, be, registered, using, the, characters, and, from, 2003, in, swedish, orthography, the, colon, is, used, in, a, similar, manner, as, in, english, with, some, exceptions, the, colon, is, used, for, some, abbreviations, such, as, 3, e, for, tredje, third, and, s, t, for, sankt, saint, and, for, all, types, of, endings, that, can, be, added, to, numbers, letters, and, abbreviations, such, as, a, et, the, a, and, cd, n, the, cd, or, the, genitive, form, usa, s, usa, s, according, to, a, traditional, division, of, swedish, dialects, there, are, six, main, groups, of, dialects, the, traditional, definition, of, a, swedish, dialect, has, been, a, local, variant, that, has, not, been, heavily, influenced, by, the, standard, language, and, that, can, trace, a, separate, development, all, the, way, back, to, old, norse, many, of, the, genuine, rural, dialects, such, as, those, of, orsa, in, dalarna, or, n, rpes, in, sterbotten, have, very, distinct, phonetic, and, grammatical, features, such, as, plural, forms, of, verbs, or, archaic, case, inflections, these, dialects, can, be, near, incomprehensible, to, a, majority, of, swedes, and, most, of, their, speakers, are, also, fluent, in, standard, swedish, the, different, dialects, are, often, so, localized, that, they, are, limited, to, individual, parishes, and, are, referred, to, by, swedish, linguists, as, sockenm, l, lit, parish, speech, they, are, generally, separated, into, six, major, groups, with, common, characteristics, of, prosody, grammar, and, vocabulary, one, or, several, examples, from, each, group, are, given, here, though, each, example, is, intended, to, be, also, representative, of, the, nearby, dialects, the, actual, number, of, dialects, is, several, hundred, if, each, individual, community, is, considered, separately, this, type, of, classification, however, is, based, on, a, somewhat, romanticized, nationalist, view, of, ethnicity, and, language, the, idea, that, only, rural, variants, of, swedish, should, be, considered, genuine, is, not, generally, accepted, by, modern, scholars, no, dialects, no, matter, how, remote, or, obscure, remained, unchanged, or, undisturbed, by, a, minimum, of, influences, from, surrounding, dialects, or, the, standard, language, especially, not, from, the, late, 19th, century, onwards, with, the, advent, of, mass, media, and, advanced, forms, of, transport, the, differences, are, today, more, accurately, described, by, a, scale, that, runs, from, standard, language, to, rural, dialect, where, the, speech, even, of, the, same, person, may, vary, from, one, extreme, to, the, other, depending, on, the, situation, all, swedish, dialects, with, the, exception, of, the, highly, diverging, forms, of, speech, in, dalarna, norrbotten, and, to, some, extent, gotland, can, be, considered, to, be, part, of, a, common, mutually, intelligible, dialect, continuum, this, continuum, may, also, include, norwegian, and, some, danish, dialects, the, samples, linked, below, have, been, taken, from, swedia, a, research, project, on, swedish, modern, dialects, available, for, download, though, with, information, in, swedish, only, with, many, more, samples, from, 100, different, dialects, with, recordings, from, four,

used, for, the, finnish, variant, of, standard, swedish, and, rikssvenska, refers, to, swedish, as, spoken, in, sweden, in, general, in, a, poll, conducted, in, 2005, by, the, swedish, retail, institute, handelns, utredningsinstitut, the, attitudes, of, swedes, to, the, use, of, certain, dialects, by, salesmen, revealed, that, 54, believed, that, rikssvenska, was, the, variety, they, would, prefer, to, hear, when, speaking, with, salesmen, over, the, phone, even, though, dialects, such, as, gotl, ndska, or, sk, nska, were, provided, as, alternatives, in, the, poll, finland, was, a, part, of, sweden, from, the, 13th, century, until, the, loss, of, the, finnish, territories, to, russia, in, 1809, swedish, was, the, sole, administrative, language, until, 1902, as, well, as, the, dominant, language, of, culture, and, education, until, finnish, independence, in, 1917, the, percentage, of, swedish, speakers, in, finland, has, steadily, decreased, since, then, the, swedish, speaking, population, is, mainly, concentrated, in, the, coastal, areas, of, ostrobothnia, southwest, finland, and, nyland, where, the, percentage, of, finland, swedes, partly, is, high, with, swedish, being, spoken, by, more, than, 90, of, the, population, in, several, municipalities, and, on, land, where, swedish, is, spoken, by, a, vast, majority, of, the, population, and, is, the, only, official, language, swedish, is, an, official, language, also, in, the, rest, of, finland, though, with, the, same, official, status, as, finnish, the, country, s, public, broadcaster, yle, provides,

of, stockholm, gothenburg, and, malm, these, varieties, could, alternatively, be, classified, as, sociolects, because, the, immigrant, dialects, share, common, traits, independent, of, their, geographical, spread, or, the, native, country, of, the, speakers, however, some, studies, have, found, distinctive, features, and, led, to, terms, such, as, roseng, rd, swedish, after, roseng, rd, in, malm, a, variant, of, scanian, a, survey, made, by, the, swedish, linguist, ulla, britt, kotsinas, showed, that, foreign, learners, had, difficulties, in, guessing, the, origins, of, rinkeby,
