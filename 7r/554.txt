property, law, is, the, area, of, law, that, governs, the, various, forms, of, ownership, in, real, property, land, and, personal, property, property, refers, to, legally, protected, claims, to, resources, such, as, land, and, personal, property, including, intellectual, property, property, can, be, exchanged, through, contract, law, and, if, property, is, violated, one, could, sue, under, tort, law, to, protect, it, the, concept, idea, or, philosophy, of, property, underlies, all, property, law, in, some, jurisdictions, historically, all, property, was, owned, by, the, monarch, and, it, devolved, through, feudal, land, tenure, or, other, feudal, systems, of, loyalty, and, fealty, the, word, property, in, everyday, usage, refers, to, an, object, or, objects, owned, by, a, person, a, car, a, book, or, a, cellphone, and, the, relationship, the, person, has, to, it, in, law, the, concept, acquires, a, more, nuanced, rendering, factors, to, consider, include, the, nature, of, the, object, the, relationship, between, the, person, and, the, object, the, relationship, between, a, number, of, people, in, relation, to, the, object, and, how, the, object, is, regarded, within, the, prevailing, political, system, most, broadly, and, concisely, property, in, the, legal, sense, refers, to, the, rights, of, people, in, or, over, certain, objects, or, things, non, legally, recognized, or, documented, property, rights, are, known, as, informal, property, rights, these, informal, property, rights, are, non, codified, or, documented, but, recognized, among, local, residents, to, varying, degrees, in, capitalist, societies, with, market, economies, much, of, property, is, owned, privately, by, persons, or, associations, and, not, the, government, five, general, justifications, have, been, given, on, private, property, rights, arguments, in, favor, of, limiting, private, property, rights, have, also, been, raised, in, his, second, treatise, on, government, english, philosopher, john, locke, asserted, the, right, of, an, individual, to, own, one, part, of, the, world, when, according, to, the, bible, god, gave, the, world, to, all, humanity, in, common, he, claimed, that, although, persons, belong, to, god, they, own, the, fruits, of, their, labor, when, a, person, works, that, labor, enters, into, the, object, thus, the, object, becomes, the, property, of, that, person, however, locke, conditioned, property, on, the, lockean, proviso, that, is, there, is, enough, and, as, good, left, in, common, for, others, u, s, supreme, court, justice, james, wilson, undertook, a, survey, of, the, philosophical, grounds, of, american, property, law, in, 1790, and, 1791, he, proceeds, from, two, premises, every, crime, includes, an, injury, every, injury, includes, a, violation, of, a, right, lectures, iii, ii, the, government, s, role, in, protecting, property, depends, upon, an, idea, of, right, wilson, believes, that, man, has, a, natural, right, to, his, property, to, his, character, to, liberty, and, to, safety, he, also, indicates, that, the, primary, and, principal, object, in, the, institution, of, government, was, to, acquire, a, new, security, for, the, possession, or, the, recovery, of, those, rights, wilson, states, that, property, is, the, right, or, lawful, power, which, a, person, has, to, a, thing, he, then, divides, the, right, into, three, degrees, possession, the, lowest, possession, and, use, and, possession, use, and, disposition, the, highest, further, he, states, useful, and, skillful, industry, is, the, soul, of, an, active, life, but, industry, should, have, her, just, reward, that, reward, is, property, for, of, useful, and, active, industry, property, is, the, natural, result, from, this, simple, reasoning, he, is, able, to, present, the, conclusion, that, exclusive, as, opposed, to, communal, property, is, to, be, preferred, wilson, does, however, give, a, survey, of, communal, property, arrangements, in, history, not, only, in, colonial, virginia, but, also, ancient, sparta, there, are, two, main, views, on, the, right, to, property, the, traditional, view, and, the, bundle, of, rights, view, the, traditionalists, believe, that, there, is, a, core, inherent, meaning, in, the, concept, of, property, while, the, bundle, of, rights, view, states, that, the, property, owner, only, has, bundle, of, permissible, uses, over, the, property, the, two, views, exist, on, a, spectrum, and, the, difference, may, be, a, matter, of, focus, and, emphasis, william, blackstone, in, his, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, wrote, that, the, essential, core, of, property, is, the, right, to, exclude, that, is, the, owner, of, property, must, be, able, to, exclude, others, from, the, thing, in, question, even, though, the, right, to, exclude, is, subject, to, limitations, by, implication, the, owner, can, use, the, thing, unless, another, restriction, such, as, zoning, law, prevents, it, other, traditionalists, argue, that, three, main, rights, define, property, the, right, to, exclusion, use, and, transfer, an, alternative, view, of, property, favored, by, legal, realists, is, that, property, simply, denotes, a, bundle, of, rights, defined, by, law, and, social, policy, which, rights, are, included, in, the, bundle, known, as, property, rights, and, which, bundles, are, preferred, to, which, others, is, simply, a, matter, of, policy, therefore, a, government, can, prevent, the, building, of, a, factory, on, a, piece, of, land, through, zoning, law, or, criminal, law, without, damaging, the, concept, of, property, the, bundle, of, rights, view, was, prominent, in, academia, in, the, 20th, century, and, remains, influential, today, in, american, law, different, parties, may, claim, a, competing, interest, in, the, same, property, by, mistake, or, by, fraud, with, the, claims, being, inconsistent, of, each, other, for, example, the, party, creating, or, transferring, an, interest, may, have, a, valid, title, but, may, intentionally, or, negligently, create, several, interests, wholly, or, partially, inconsistent, with, each, other, a, court, resolves, the, dispute, by, adjudicating, the, priorities, of, the, interests, property, rights, are, rights, over, things, enforceable, against, all, other, persons, by, contrast, contractual, rights, are, rights, enforceable, against, particular, persons, property, rights, may, however, arise, from, a, contract, the, two, systems, of, rights, overlap, in, relation, to, the, sale, of, land, for, example, two, sets, of, legal, relationships, exist, alongside, one, another, the, contractual, right, to, sue, for, damages, and, the, property, right, exercisable, over, the, land, more, minor, property, rights, may, be, created, by, contract, as, in, the, case, of, easements, covenants, and, equitable, servitudes, a, separate, distinction, is, evident, where, the, rights, granted, are, insufficiently, substantial, to, confer, on, the, nonowner, a, definable, interest, or, right, in, the, thing, the, clearest, example, of, these, rights, is, the, license, in, general, even, if, licenses, are, created, by, a, binding, contract, they, do, not, give, rise, to, property, interests, property, rights, are, also, distinguished, from, personal, rights, practically, all, contemporary, societies, acknowledge, this, basic, ontological, and, ethical, distinction, in, the, past, groups, lacking, political, power, have, often, been, disqualified, from, the, benefits, of, property, in, an, extreme, form, this, has, meant, that, people, have, become, objects, of, property, legally, things, or, chattels, see, slavery, more, commonly, marginalized, groups, have, been, denied, legal, rights, to, own, property, these, include, jews, in, england, and, married, women, in, western, societies, until, the, late, 19th, century, the, dividing, line, between, personal, rights, and, property, rights, is, not, always, easy, to, draw, for, instance, is, one, s, reputation, property, that, can, be, commercially, exploited, by, affording, property, rights, to, it, the, question, of, the, proprietary, character, of, personal, rights, is, particularly, relevant, in, the, case, of, rights, over, human, tissue, organs, and, other, body, parts, in, the, united, states, a, quasi, property, interest, has, been, explicitly, declared, in, the, dead, body, also, in, the, united, states, it, has, been, recognised, that, people, have, an, alienable, proprietary, right, of, publicity, over, their, persona, the, patent, patenting, of, biotechnological, processes, and, products, based, on, human, genetic, material, may, be, characterised, as, creating, property, in, human, life, a, particularly, difficult, question, is, whether, people, have, rights, to, intellectual, property, developed, by, others, from, their, body, parts, in, the, pioneering, case, on, this, issue, the, supreme, court, of, california, held, in, moore, v, regents, of, the, university, of, california, 1990, that, individuals, do, not, have, such, a, property, right, property, law, is, characterised, by, a, great, deal, of, historical, continuity, and, technical, terminology, the, basic, distinction, in, common, law, systems, is, between, real, property, land, and, personal, property, chattels, before, the, mid, 19th, century, the, principles, governing, the, transfer, of, real, property, and, personal, property, on, an, intestacy, were, quite, different, though, this, dichotomy, does, not, have, the, same, significance, anymore, the, distinction, is, still, fundamental, because, of, the, essential, differences, between, the, two, categories, an, obvious, example, is, the, fact, that, land, is, immovable, and, thus, the, rules, that, govern, its, use, must, differ, a, further, reason, for, the, distinction, is, that, legislation, is, often, drafted, employing, the, traditional, terminology, the, division, of, land, and, chattels, has, been, criticised, as, being, not, satisfactory, as, a, basis, for, categorising, the, principles, of, property, law, since, it, concentrates, attention, not, on, the, proprietary, interests, themselves, but, on, the, objects, of, those, interests, moreover, in, the, case, of, fixtures, chattels, which, are, affixed, to, or, placed, on, land, may, become, part, of, the, land, real, property, is, generally, sub, classified, into, although, a, tenancy, involves, rights, to, real, property, a, leasehold, estate, is, typically, considered, personal, property, being, derived, from, contract, law, in, the, civil, law, system, the, distinction, is, between, movable, and, immovable, property, with, movable, property, roughly, corresponding, to, personal, property, while, immovable, property, corresponding, to, real, estate, or, real, property, and, the, associated, rights, and, obligations, thereon, the, concept, of, possession, developed, from, a, legal, system, whose, principal, concern, was, to, avoid, civil, disorder, the, general, principle, is, that, a, person, in, possession, of, land, or, goods, even, as, a, wrongdoer, is, entitled, to, take, action, against, anyone, interfering, with, the, possession, unless, the, person, interfering, is, able, to, demonstrate, a, superior, right, to, do, so, in, england, the, torts, interference, with, goods, act, 1977, has, significantly, amended, the, law, relating, to, wrongful, interference, with, goods, and, abolished, some, longstanding, remedies, and, doctrines, the, term, transfer, of, property, means, an, act, by, which, a, living, person, company, or, state, conveys, property, in, present, or, in, future, to, one, or, more, other, living, persons, to, himself, and, one, or, more, other, living, persons, to, the, state, or, to, a, private, company, the, transfer, of, property, can, be, consensual, or, non, consensual, and, to, transfer, property, is, to, perform, such, an, act, the, most, common, method, of, acquiring, an, interest, in, property, is, as, the, result, of, a, consensual, transaction, with, the, previous, owner, for, example, a, sale, a, gift, or, through, inheritance, in, law, an, inheritor, is, a, person, who, is, entitled, to, receive, a, share, of, the, heritor, s, the, person, who, died, property, subject, to, the, rules, of, inheritance, in, the, jurisdiction, of, which, the, heritor, was, a, citizen, or, where, the, heritor, died, or, owned, property, at, the, time, of, death, dispositions, by, will, may, also, be, regarded, as, consensual, transactions, since, the, effect, of, a, will, is, to, provide, for, the, distribution, of, the, deceased, person, s, property, to, nominated, beneficiaries, a, person, may, also, obtain, an, interest, in, property, under, a, trust, established, for, his, or, her, benefit, by, the, owner, of, the, property, it, is, also, possible, for, property, to, pass, from, one, person, to, another, independently, of, the, consent, of, the, property, owner, for, example, this, occurs, when, a, person, dies, intestate, goes, bankrupt, or, has, the, property, taken, in, execution, of, a, court, judgment, there, are, cases, when, a, person, is, legally, capable, of, owning, property, but, is, not, capable, of, maintaining, and, dealing, with, it, such, as, paying, property, taxes, this, is, the, case, for, young, children, and, mentally, handicapped, individuals, the, state, deems, them, incompetent, in, their, capacity, to, deal, with, property, thus, they, must, be, appointed, a, legal, guardian, to, deal, with, the, property, on, the, incompetent, individual, s, behalf, in, cases, where, the, individual, cannot, find, a, legal, guardian, to, deal, with, the, property, the, property, is, put, up, for, sale, and, the, incompetent, individual, is, involuntarily, deprived, of, such, property, tax, sales, are, another, process, by, which, individuals, can, be, forcibly, deprived, of, their, private, property, a, tax, sale, is, the, forced, sale, of, property, by, the, state, due, to, unpaid, taxes, on, that, property, the, property, is, typically, auctioned, off, as, a, tax, sale, by, the, local, government, to, payoff, the, delinquent, taxes, on, that, property, one, could, make, the, argument, that, given, the, presence, of, property, taxes, an, individual, never, truly, owns, a, piece, of, property, they, rent, it, from, the, government, property, can, also, pass, from, one, person, to, the, state, independently, of, the, consent, of, the, property, owner, through, the, state, s, power, of, eminent, domain, eminent, domain, refers, to, the, ability, of, the, state, to, buyout, private, property, from, individuals, at, their, will, in, order, to, use, the, property, for, public, use, eminent, domain, requires, the, state, to, justly, compensate, the, property, owner, for, the, acquisition, of, their, land, the, practice, dates, back, to, at, least, the, 17th, century, common, examples, include, buying, land, from, individuals, in, order, for, the, state, to, build, public, roads, transportation, systems, governmental, buildings, and, to, construct, certain, public, goods, the, state, also, uses, its, eminent, domain, power, for, large, urban, renewal, projects, by, which, it, will, buy, out, large, portions, of, typically, poor, housing, areas, in, order, to, rebuild, it, eminent, domain, also, consists, of, enabling, the, state, to, condemn, certain, real, estate, construction, and, development, rights, for, various, reasons, one, must, meet, location, specific, regulatory, standards, and, building, codes, in, order, to, construct, on, property, the, general, rule, for, stairs,

or, step, failure, to, meet, these, regulatory, standards, can, result, in, an, inability, to, receive, state, building, permits, state, destruction, of, property, legal, fines, and, increased, liability, kelo, v, new, london, 04, 108, 545, u, s, 469, 2005, was, a, pivotal, case, that, increased, the, scope, of, the, eminent, domain, power, of, the, state, the, u, s, supreme, court, ruled, that, private, property, could, be, condemned, by, the, state, and, transferred, to, a, private, company, in, property, law, economics, and, finance, the, term, legal, successor, may, refer, to, a, legally, established, successor, of, property, rights, inheritance, interest, or, in, terms, of, liabilities, debt, in, the, case, of, bankruptcy, of, a, lender, the, legal, successor, in, interest, has, the, right, to, collect, the, debt, historically, leases, served, many, purposes, and, the, regulation, varied, according, to, intended, purposes, and, the, economic, conditions, of, the, time, leaseholds, for, example, were, mainly, granted, for, agriculture, until, the, late, eighteenth, century, and, early, nineteenth, century, when, the, growth, of, cities, made, the, leasehold, an, important, form, of, landholding, in, urban, areas, the, modern, law, of, landlord, and, tenant, in, common, law, jurisdictions, retains, the, influence, of, the, common, law, and, particularly, the, laissez, faire, philosophy, that, dominated, the, law, of, contract, and, the, law, of, property, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, growth, of, consumerism, the, law, of, consumer, protection, recognised, that, common, law, principles, assuming, equal, bargaining, power, between, parties, may, cause, unfairness, consequently, reformers, have, emphasised, the, need, to, assess, residential, tenancy, laws, in, terms, of, protection, they, provide, to, tenants, legislation, to, protect, tenants, is, now, common, property, can, mostly, be, owned, by, any, single, human, however, many, jurisdictions, have, some, stipulations, that, limit, property, owning, capacity, the, two, main, limiting, factors, include, citizenship, and, competency, of, maintaining, property, in, many, countries, non, citizens, cannot, own, property, or, are, limited, greatly, in, their, capacity, to, own, property, the, united, states, allows, foreign, entities, to, buy, and, own, property, but,
