sociolinguistics, is, the, descriptive, study, of, the, effect, of, any, or, all, aspects, of, society, including, cultural, norms, expectations, and, context, on, language, and, the, ways, it, is, used, it, can, overlap, with, the, sociology, of, language, which, focuses, on, the, effect, of, language, on, society, sociolinguistics, overlaps, considerably, with, pragmatics, and, is, closely, related, to, linguistic, anthropology, sociolinguistics, historical, interrelation, with, anthropology, can, be, observed, in, studies, of, how, language, varieties, differ, between, groups, separated, by, social, variables, e, g, ethnicity, religion, status, gender, level, of, education, age, etc, and, or, geographical, barriers, a, mountain, range, a, desert, a, river, etc, such, studies, also, examine, how, such, differences, in, usage, and, differences, in, beliefs, about, usage, produce, and, reflect, social, or, socioeconomic, classes, as, the, usage, of, a, language, varies, from, place, to, place, language, usage, also, varies, among, social, classes, and, it, is, these, sociolects, that, sociolinguistics, studies, studies, in, the, field, of, sociolinguistics, typically, collect, data, through, conversational, interviews, with, members, of, a, population, of, interest, researchers, then, assess, the, realization, of, linguistic, variables, in, the, resulting, speech, corpus, other, research, methods, in, sociolinguistics, include, matched, guise, tests, in, which, listeners, share, their, evaluations, of, linguistic, features, they, hear, dialect, surveys, and, analysis, of, preexisting, corpora, the, social, aspects, of, language, were, in, the, modern, sense, first, studied, by, indian, and, japanese, linguists, in, the, 1930s, and, also, by, louis, gauchat, in, switzerland, in, the, early, 1900s, but, none, received, much, attention, in, the, west, until, much, later, the, study, of, the, social, motivation, of, language, change, on, the, other, hand, has, its, foundation, in, the, wave, model, of, the, late, 19th, century, the, first, attested, use, of, the, term, sociolinguistics, was, by, thomas, callan, hodson, in, the, title, of, his, 1939, article, sociolinguistics, in, india, published, in, man, in, india, the, study, of, sociolinguistics, in, the, west, was, pioneered, by, linguists, such, as, william, labov, in, the, us, and, basil, bernstein, in, the, uk, in, the, 1960s, william, stewart, and, heinz, kloss, introduced, the, basic, concepts, for, the, sociolinguistic, theory, of, pluricentric, languages, which, describes, how, standard, language, varieties, differ, between, nations, e, g, regional, varieties, of, english, versus, pluricentric, english, regional, standards, of, german, versus, pluricentric, german, bosnian, croatian, montenegrin, and, serbian, versus, pluricentric, serbo, croatian, dell, hymes, one, of, the, founders, of, linguistic, anthropology, is, credited, with, developing, an, ethnography, based, sociolinguistics, and, is, the, founder, of, the, journal, language, in, society, his, focus, on, ethnography, and, communicative, competence, contributed, to, his, development, of, the, speaking, method, an, acronym, for, setting, participants, ends, act, sequence, keys, instrumentalities, norms, and, genres, that, is, widely, recognized, as, a, tool, to, analyze, speech, events, in, their, cultural, context, a, sociolinguist, might, study, how, social, attitudes, determine, what, is, considered, appropriate, language, use, or, inappropriate, language, use, in, a, particular, setting, sociolinguists, might, also, study, the, grammar, phonetics, vocabulary, and, other, aspects, of, various, sociolects, sociolinguists, also, study, language, on, a, national, level, among, large, populations, to, find, out, how, language, is, used, as, a, social, institution, william, labov, a, harvard, and, columbia, university, graduate, is, often, regarded, as, one, of, the, founders, of, the, study, of, sociolinguistics, he, focuses, on, the, quantitative, analysis, of, variation, and, change, within, languages, making, sociolinguistics, a, scientific, discipline, for, example, a, sociolinguistics, based, translation, framework, states, that, a, linguistically, appropriate, translation, cannot, be, wholly, sufficient, to, achieve, the, communicative, effect, of, the, source, language, the, translation, must, also, incorporate, the, social, practices, and, cultural, norms, of, the, target, language, to, reveal, social, practices, and, cultural, norms, beyond, lexical, and, syntactic, levels, the, framework, includes, empirical, testing, of, the, translation, using, methods, such, as, cognitive, interviewing, with, a, sample, population, a, commonly, studied, source, of, variation, is, regional, dialects, dialectology, studies, variations, in, language, based, primarily, on, geographic, distribution, and, their, associated, features, sociolinguists, concerned, with, grammatical, and, phonological, features, that, correspond, to, regional, areas, are, often, called, dialectologists, the, sociolinguistic, interview, is, the, foundational, method, of, collecting, data, for, sociolinguistic, studies, allowing, the, researcher, to, collect, large, amounts, of, speech, from, speakers, of, the, language, or, dialect, being, studied, the, interview, takes, the, form, of, a, long, loosely, structured, conversation, between, the, researcher, and, the, interview, subject, the, researcher, s, primary, goal, is, to, elicit, the, vernacular, style, of, speech, i, e, the, register, associated, with, everyday, casual, conversation, this, goal, is, complicated, by, the, observer, s, paradox, the, researcher, is, trying, to, elicit, the, style, of, speech, that, would, be, used, if, the, interviewer, were, not, present, to, this, end, a, variety, of, techniques, may, be, used, to, reduce, the, subject, s, attention, to, the, formality, and, artificiality, of, the, interview, setting, for, example, the, researcher, may, attempt, to, elicit, narratives, of, memorable, events, from, the, subject, s, life, such, as, fights, or, near, death, experiences, the, subject, s, emotional, involvement, in, telling, the, story, is, thought, to, distract, their, attention, from, the, formality, of, the, context, some, researchers, interview, multiple, subjects, together, in, order, to, allow, them, to, converse, more, casually, with, each, other, than, they, would, with, the, interviewer, alone, the, researcher, may, then, study, the, effects, of, style, shifting, on, language, by, comparing, a, subject, s, speech, style, in, more, vernacular, contexts, such, as, narratives, of, personal, experience, or, conversation, between, subjects, with, the, more, careful, style, produced, when, the, subject, is, more, attentive, to, the, formal, interview, setting, the, correlations, of, demographic, features, such, as, age, gender, and, ethnicity, with, speech, behavior, may, be, studied, by, comparing, the, speech, of, different, interview, subjects, while, the, study, of, sociolinguistics, is, very, broad, there, are, a, few, fundamental, concepts, on, which, many, sociolinguistic, inquiries, depend, speech, community, is, a, concept, in, sociolinguistics, that, describes, a, distinct, group, of, people, who, use, language, in, a, unique, and, mutually, accepted, way, among, themselves, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, sprechbund, to, be, considered, part, of, a, speech, community, one, must, have, a, communicative, competence, that, is, the, speaker, has, the, ability, to, use, language, in, a, way, that, is, appropriate, in, the, given, situation, it, is, possible, for, a, speaker, to, be, communicatively, competent, in, more, than, one, language, demographic, characteristics, such, as, areas, or, locations, have, helped, to, create, speech, community, boundaries, in, speech, community, concept, those, characteristics, can, assist, exact, descriptions, of, specific, groups, communication, patterns, speech, communities, can, be, members, of, a, profession, with, a, specialized, jargon, distinct, social, groups, like, high, school, students, or, hip, hop, fans, or, even, tight, knit, groups, like, families, and, friends, members, of, speech, communities, will, often, develop, slang, or, specialized, jargon, to, serve, the, group, s, special, purposes, and, priorities, this, is, evident, in, the, use, of, lingo, within, sports, teams, community, of, practice, allows, for, sociolinguistics, to, examine, the, relationship, between, socialization, competence, and, identity, since, identity, is, a, very, complex, structure, studying, language, socialization, is, a, means, to, examine, the, micro, interactional, level, of, practical, activity, everyday, activities, the, learning, of, a, language, is, greatly, influenced, by, family, but, it, is, supported, by, the, larger, local, surroundings, such, as, school, sports, teams, or, religion, speech, communities, may, exist, within, a, larger, community, of, practice, crucial, to, sociolinguistic, analysis, is, the, concept, of, prestige, certain, speech, habits, are, assigned, a, positive, or, a, negative, value, which, is, then, applied, to, the, speaker, this, can, operate, on, many, levels, it, can, be, realized, on, the, level, of, the, individual, sound, phoneme, as, labov, discovered, in, investigating, pronunciation, of, the, post, vocalic, r, in, the, north, eastern, us, or, on, the, macro, scale, of, language, choice, as, realized, in, the, various, diglossia, that, exist, throughout, the, world, where, swiss, german, high, german, is, perhaps, most, well, known, an, important, implication, of, the, sociolinguistic, theory, is, that, speakers, choose, a, variety, when, making, a, speech, act, whether, consciously, or, subconsciously, the, terms, acrolectal, high, and, basilectal, low, are, also, used, to, distinguish, between, a, more, standard, dialect, and, a, dialect, of, less, prestige, it, is, generally, assumed, that, non, standard, language, is, low, prestige, language, however, in, certain, groups, such, as, traditional, working, class, neighborhoods, standard, language, may, be, considered, undesirable, in, many, contexts, this, is, because, the, working, class, dialect, is, generally, considered, a, powerful, in, group, marker, historically, humans, tend, to, favor, those, who, look, and, sound, like, them, and, the, use, of, non, standard, varieties, even, exaggeratedly, so, expresses, neighborhood, pride, and, group, and, class, solidarity, there, will, thus, be, a, considerable, difference, in, use, of, non, standard, varieties, when, going, to, the, pub, or, having, a, neighborhood, barbecue, compared, to, going, to, the, bank, one, is, a, relaxed, setting, likely, with, familiar, people, and, the, other, has, a, business, aspect, to, it, in, which, one, feels, the, need, to, be, more, professional, understanding, language, in, society, means, that, one, also, has, to, understand, the, social, networks, in, which, language, is, embedded, a, social, network, is, another, way, of, describing, a, particular, speech, community, in, terms, of, relations, between, individual, members, in, a, community, a, network, could, be, loose, or, tight, depending, on, how, members, interact, with, each, other, for, instance, an, office, or, factory, may, be, considered, a, tight, community, because, all, members, interact, with, each, other, a, large, course, with, 100, students, would, be, a, looser, community, because, students, may, only, interact, with, the, instructor, and, maybe, 1, 2, other, students, a, multiplex, community, is, one, in, which, members, have, multiple, relationships, with, each, other, for, instance, in, some, neighborhoods, members, may, live, on, the, same, street, work, for, the, same, employer, and, even, intermarry, the, looseness, or, tightness, of, a, social, network, may, affect, speech, patterns, adopted, by, a, speaker, for, instance, sylvie, dubois, and, barbara, horvath, found, that, speakers, in, one, cajun, louisiana, community, were, more, likely, to, pronounce, english, th, as, or, as, if, they, participated, in, a, relatively, dense, social, network, i, e, had, strong, local, ties, and, interacted, with, many, other, speakers, in, the, community, and, less, likely, if, their, networks, were, looser, i, e, fewer, local, ties, a, social, network, may, apply, to, the, macro, level, of, a, country, or, a, city, but, also, to, the, interpersonal, level, of, neighborhoods, or, a, single, family, recently, social, networks, have, been, formed, by, the, internet, through, online, chat, rooms, facebook, groups, organizations, and, online, dating, services, sociolinguistics, as, a, field, distinct, from, dialectology, was, pioneered, through, the, study, of, language, variation, in, urban, areas, whereas, dialectology, studies, the, geographic, distribution, of, language, variation, sociolinguistics, focuses, on, other, sources, of, variation, among, them, class, class, and, occupation, are, among, the, most, important, linguistic, markers, found, in, society, one, of, the, fundamental, findings, of, sociolinguistics, which, has, been, hard, to, disprove, is, that, class, and, language, variety, are, related, members, of, the, working, class, tend, to, speak, less, of, what, is, deemed, standard, language, while, the, lower, middle, and, upper, middle, class, will, in, turn, speak, closer, to, the, standard, however, the, upper, class, even, members, of, the, upper, middle, class, may, often, speak, less, standard, than, the, middle, class, this, is, because, not, only, class, but, class, aspirations, are, important, one, may, speak, differently, or, cover, up, an, undesirable, accent, to, appear, to, have, a, different, social, status, and, fit, in, better, with, either, those, around, them, or, how, they, wish, to, be, perceived, studies, such, as, those, by, william, labov, in, the, 1960s, have, shown, that, social, aspirations, influence, speech, patterns, this, is, also, true, of, class, aspirations, in, the, process, of, wishing, to, be, associated, with, a, certain, class, usually, the, upper, class, and, upper, middle, class, people, who, are, moving, in, that, direction, socio, economically, may, adjust, their, speech, patterns, to, sound, like, them, however, not, being, native, upper, class, speakers, they, often, hypercorrect, which, involves, overcorrecting, their, speech, to, the, point, of, introducing, new, errors, the, same, is, true, for, individuals, moving, down, in, socio, economic, status, in, any, contact, situation, there, is, a, power, dynamic, be, it, a, teacher, student, or, employee, customer, situation, this, power, dynamic, results, in, a, hierarchical, differentiation, between, languages, basil, bernstein, a, well, known, british, socio, linguist, devised, in, his, book, elaborated, and, restricted, codes, their, social, origins, and, some, consequences, a, method, for, categorizing, language, codes, according, to, variable, emphases, on, verbal, and, extraverbal, communication, he, claimed, that, factors, like, family, orientation, social, control, verbal, feedback, and, possibly, social, class, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, two, codes, elaborated, and, restricted, according, to, basil, bernstein, the, restricted, code, exemplified, the, predominance, of, extraverbal, communication, with, an, emphasis, on, interpersonal, connection, over, individual, expression, his, theory, places, this, code, within, environments, that, operate, according, to, established, social, structures, that, predetermine, the, roles, of, their, members, in, which, the, commonality, of, interests, and, intents, due, to, a, shared, local, identity, creates, a, predictability, of, discrete, intent, and, therefore, a, simplification, of, verbal, utterances, such, environments, may, include, military, religious, and, legal, atmospheres, criminal, and, prison, subcultures, long, term, married, relationships, and, friendships, between, children, due, to, the, strong, bonds, between, speakers, explicit, verbal, communication, is, often, rendered, unnecessary, and, individual, expression, irrelevant, however, simplification, is, not, a, sign, of, a, lack, of, intelligence, or, complexity, within, the, code, rather, communication, is, performed, more, through, extraverbal, means, facial, expression, touch, etc, in, order, to, affirm, the, speakers, bond, bernstein, notes, the, example, of, a, young, man, asking, a, stranger, to, dance, there, is, an, established, manner, of, asking, and, yet, communication, is, performed, through, physical, graces, and, the, exchange, of, glances, as, such, implied, meaning, plays, a, greater, role, in, this, code, than, in, the, elaborated, code, restricted, code, also, operates, to, unify, speakers, and, foster, solidarity, basil, bernstein, defined, elaborated, code, according, to, its, emphasis, on, verbal, communication, over, extraverbal, this, code, is, typical, in, environments, where, a, variety, of, social, roles, are, available, to, the, individual, to, be, chosen, based, upon, disposition, and, temperament, most, of, the, time, speakers, of, elaborated, code, utilize, a, broader, lexicon, and, demonstrate, less, syntactic, predictability, than, speakers, of, restricted, code, the, lack, of, predetermined, structure, and, solidarity, requires, explicit, verbal, communication, of, discrete, intent, by, the, individual, in, order, to, achieve, educational, and, career, success, bernstein, notes, with, caution, the, association, of, this, code, with, upper, classes, while, restricted, code, is, associated, with, lower, classes, where, the, abundance, of, available, resources, allows, persons, to, choose, their, social, roles, warning, however, that, studies, associating, the, codes, with, separate, social, classes, used, small, samples, and, were, subject, to, significant, variation, he, also, asserts, that, elaborated, code, originates, due, to, differences, in, social, context, rather, than, intellectual, advantages, as, such, elaborated, code, differs, from, restricted, code, according, to, the, context, based, emphasis, on, individual, advancement, over, assertion, of, social, community, ties, bernstein, explains, language, development, according, to, the, two, codes, in, light, of, their, fundamentally, different, values, for, instance, a, child, exposed, solely, to, restricted, code, learns, extraverbal, communication, over, verbal, and, therefore, may, have, a, less, extensive, vocabulary, than, a, child, raised, with, exposure, to, both, codes, while, there, is, no, inherent, lack, of, value, to, restricted, code, a, child, without, exposure, to, elaborated, code, may, encounter, difficulties, upon, entering, formal, education, in, which, standard, clear, verbal, communication, and, comprehension, is, necessary, for, learning, and, effective, interaction, both, with, instructors, and, other, students, from, differing, backgrounds, as, such, it, may, be, beneficial, for, children, who, have, been, exposed, solely, to, restricted, code, to, enter, pre, school, training, in, elaborated, code, in, order, to, acquire, a, manner, of, speaking, that, is, considered, appropriate, and, widely, comprehensible, within, the, education, environment, additionally, bernstein, notes, several, studies, in, language, development, according, to, social, class, in, 1963, the, committee, for, higher, education, conducted, a, study, on, verbal, iq, that, showed, a, deterioration, in, individuals, from, lower, working, classes, ages, 8, 11, and, 11, 15, years, in, comparison, to, those, from, middle, classes, having, been, exposed, to, both, restricted, and, elaborated, codes, additionally, studies, by, bernstein, venables, and, ravenette, as, well, as, a, 1958, education, council, report, show, a, relative, lack, of, success, on, verbal, tasks, in, comparison, to, extraverbal, in, children, from, lower, working, classes, having, been, exposed, solely, to, restricted, code, the, idea, of, these, social, language, codes, from, bernstein, contrast, with, famous, linguist, noam, chomsky, s, ideas, chomsky, deemed, the, father, of, modern, linguistics, argues, that, there, is, a, universal, grammar, meaning, that, humans, are, born, with, an, innate, capacity, for, linguistic, skills, like, sentence, building, this, theory, has, been, criticized, by, several, scholars, of, linguistic, backgrounds, because, of, the, lack, of, proven, evolutionary, feasibility, and, the, fact, that, different, languages, do, not, have, universal, characteristics, the, study, of, language, variation, is, concerned, with, social, constraints, determining, language, in, its, contextual, environment, the, variations, will, determine, some, of, the, aspects, of, language, like, the, sound, grammar, and, tone, in, which, people, speak, and, even, non, verbal, cues, code, switching, is, the, term, given, to, the, use, of, different, varieties, of, language, depending, on, the, social, situation, this, is, commonly, used, among, the, african, american, population, in, the, united, states, there, are, several, different, types, of, age, based, variation, one, may, see, within, a, population, as, well, such, as, age, range, age, graded, variation, and, indications, of, linguistic, change, in, progress, the, use, of, slang, can, be, a, variation, based, on, age, younger, people, are, more, likely, to, recognize, and, use, today, s, slang, while, older, generations, may, not, recognize, new, slang, but, might, use, slang, from, when, they, were, younger, variation, may, also, be, associated, with, gender, men, and, women, on, average, tend, to, use, slightly, different, language, styles, these, differences, tend, to, be, quantitative, rather, than, qualitative, that, is, to, say, that, women, use, a, particular, speaking, style, more, than, men, do, is, akin, to, saying, that, men, are, taller, than, women, i, e, men, are, on, average, taller, than, women, but, some, women, are, taller, than, some, men, other, variations, in, speech, patterns, of, men, and, women, include, differences, in, pitch, tone, speech, fillers, interruptions, use, of, euphemisms, etc, variation, in, language, can, also, come, from, ethnicity, economic, status, level, of, education, etc
