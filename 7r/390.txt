https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_writing_system
the, modern, japanese, writing, system, uses, a, combination, of, logographic, kanji, which, are, adopted, chinese, characters, and, syllabic, kana, kana, itself, consists, of, a, pair, of, syllabaries, hiragana, used, primarily, for, native, or, naturalized, japanese, words, and, grammatical, elements, and, katakana, used, primarily, for, foreign, words, and, names, loanwords, onomatopoeia, scientific, names, and, sometimes, for, emphasis, almost, all, written, japanese, sentences, contain, a, mixture, of, kanji, and, kana, because, of, this, mixture, of, scripts, in, addition, to, a, large, inventory, of, kanji, characters, the, japanese, writing, system, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, complicated, currently, in, use, several, thousand, kanji, characters, are, in, regular, use, which, mostly, originate, from, traditional, chinese, characters, others, made, in, japan, are, referred, to, as, japanese, kanji, wasei, kanji, also, known, as, country, s, kanji, kokuji, each, character, has, an, intrinsic, meaning, or, range, of, meanings, and, most, have, more, than, one, pronunciation, the, choice, of, which, depends, on, context, japanese, primary, and, secondary, school, students, are, required, to, learn, 2, 136, j, y, kanji, as, of, 2010, the, total, number, of, kanji, is, well, over, 50, 000, though, this, includes, tens, of, thousands, of, characters, only, present, in, historical, writings, and, never, used, in, modern, japanese, in, modern, japanese, the, hiragana, and, katakana, syllabaries, each, contain, 46, basic, characters, or, 71, including, diacritics, with, one, or, two, minor, exceptions, each, different, sound, in, the, japanese, language, that, is, each, different, syllable, strictly, each, mora, corresponds, to, one, character, in, each, syllabary, unlike, kanji, these, characters, intrinsically, represent, sounds, only, they, convey, meaning, only, as, part, of, words, hiragana, and, katakana, characters, also, originally, derive, from, chinese, characters, but, they, have, been, simplified, and, modified, to, such, an, extent, that, their, origins, are, no, longer, visually, obvious, texts, without, kanji, are, rare, most, are, either, children, s, books, since, children, tend, to, know, few, kanji, at, an, early, age, or, early, electronics, such, as, computers, phones, and, video, games, which, could, not, display, complex, graphemes, like, kanji, due, to, both, graphical, and, computational, limitations, to, a, lesser, extent, modern, written, japanese, also, uses, initialisms, from, the, latin, alphabet, for, example, in, terms, such, as, bc, ad, a, m, p, m, fbi, and, cd, romanized, japanese, is, most, frequently, used, by, foreign, students, of, japanese, who, have, not, yet, mastered, kana, and, by, native, speakers, for, computer, input, kanji, are, logographic, characters, japanese, simplified, since, 1946, taken, from, chinese, script, and, used, in, the, writing, of, japanese, it, is, known, from, archaeological, evidence, that, the, first, contacts, that, the, japanese, had, with, chinese, writing, took, place, in, the, 1st, century, ad, during, the, late, yayoi, period, however, the, japanese, people, of, that, era, probably, had, little, to, no, comprehension, of, the, script, and, they, would, remain, relatively, illiterate, until, the, 5th, century, ad, in, the, kofun, period, when, writing, in, japan, became, more, widespread, kanji, characters, are, used, to, write, most, content, words, of, native, japanese, or, historically, chinese, origin, which, include, the, following, some, japanese, words, are, written, with, different, kanji, depending, on, the, specific, usage, of, the, word, for, instance, the, word, naosu, to, fix, or, to, cure, is, written, when, it, refers, to, curing, a, person, and, when, it, refers, to, fixing, an, object, most, kanji, have, more, than, one, possible, pronunciation, or, reading, and, some, common, kanji, have, many, these, are, broadly, divided, into, on, yomi, which, are, readings, that, approximate, to, a, chinese, pronunciation, of, the, character, at, the, time, it, was, adopted, into, japanese, and, kun, yomi, which, are, pronunciations, of, native, japanese, words, that, correspond, to, the, meaning, of, the, kanji, character, however, some, kanji, terms, have, pronunciations, that, correspond, to, neither, the, on, yomi, nor, the, kun, yomi, readings, of, the, individual, kanji, within, the, term, such, as, ashita, tomorrow, and, otona, adult, unusual, or, nonstandard, kanji, readings, may, be, glossed, using, furigana, kanji, compounds, are, sometimes, given, arbitrary, readings, for, stylistic, purposes, for, example, in, natsume, s, seki, s, short, story, the, fifth, night, the, author, uses, for, tsunagatte, the, gerundive, te, form, of, the, verb, tsunagaru, to, connect, which, would, usually, be, written, as, or, the, word, meaning, connection, is, normally, pronounced, setsuzoku, hiragana, emerged, as, a, manual, simplification, via, cursive, script, of, the, most, phonetically, widespread, kanji, among, those, who, could, read, and, write, during, the, heian, period, 794, 1185, the, main, creators, of, the, current, hiragana, were, ladies, of, the, japanese, imperial, court, who, used, the, script, in, the, writing, of, personal, communications, and, literature, hiragana, is, used, to, write, the, following, there, is, also, some, flexibility, for, words, with, common, kanji, renditions, to, be, instead, written, in, hiragana, depending, on, the, individual, author, s, preference, all, japanese, words, can, be, spelled, out, entirely, in, hiragana, or, katakana, even, when, they, are, normally, written, using, kanji, some, words, are, colloquially, written, in, hiragana, and, writing, them, in, kanji, might, give, them, a, more, formal, tone, while, hiragana, may, impart, a, softer, or, more, emotional, feeling, for, example, the, japanese, word, kawaii, the, japanese, equivalent, of, cute, can, be, written, entirely, in, hiragana, as, in, or, with, kanji, as, some, lexical, items, that, are, normally, written, using, kanji, have, become, grammaticalized, in, certain, contexts, where, they, are, instead, written, in, hiragana, for, example, the, root, of, the, verb, miru, see, is, normally, written, with, the, kanji, for, the, mi, portion, however, when, used, as, a, supplementary, verb, as, in, tameshite, miru, meaning, to, try, out, the, whole, verb, is, typically, written, in, hiragana, as, as, we, see, also, in, tabete, miru, try, to, eat, and, see, katakana, emerged, around, the, 9th, century, in, the, heian, period, when, buddhist, monks, created, a, syllabary, derived, from, chinese, characters, to, simplify, their, reading, using, portions, of, the, characters, as, a, kind, of, shorthand, the, origin, of, the, alphabet, is, attributed, to, the, monk, k, kai, katakana, is, used, to, write, the, following, katakana, can, also, be, used, to, impart, the, idea, that, words, are, spoken, in, a, foreign, or, otherwise, unusual, accent, for, example, the, speech, of, a, robot, the, first, contact, of, the, japanese, with, the, latin, alphabet, occurred, in, the, 16th, century, during, the, muromachi, period, when, they, had, contact, with, portuguese, navigators, the, first, european, people, to, visit, the, japanese, islands, the, earliest, japanese, romanization, system, was, based, on, portuguese, orthography, it, was, developed, around, 1548, by, a, japanese, catholic, named, anjir, the, latin, alphabet, is, used, to, write, the, following, arabic, numerals, as, opposed, to, traditional, kanji, numerals, are, often, used, to, write, numbers, in, horizontal, text, especially, when, numbering, things, rather, than, indicating, a, quantity, such, as, telephone, numbers, serial, numbers, and, addresses, arabic, numerals, were, introduced, in, japan, probably, at, the, same, time, as, the, latin, alphabet, in, the, 16th, century, during, the, muromachi, period, the, first, contact, being, via, portuguese, navigators, these, numerals, did, not, originate, in, europe, as, the, portuguese, inherited, them, during, the, arab, occupation, of, the, iberian, peninsula, see, also, japanese, numerals, hentaigana, a, set, of, archaic, kana, made, obsolete, by, the, meiji, reformation, are, sometimes, used, to, impart, an, archaic, flavor, like, in, items, of, food, esp, soba, jukujikun, refers, to, instances, in, which, words, are, written, using, kanji, that, reflect, the, meaning, of, the, word, though, the, pronunciation, of, the, word, is, entirely, unrelated, to, the, usual, pronunciations, of, the, constituent, kanji, conversely, ateji, refers, to, the, employment, of, kanji, that, appear, solely, to, represent, the, sound, of, the, compound, word, but, are, conceptually, utterly, unrelated, to, the, signification, of, the, word, sentences, are, commonly, written, using, a, combination, of, all, three, japanese, scripts, kanji, in, red, hiragana, in, purple, and, katakana, in, orange, and, in, limited, instances, also, include, latin, alphabet, characters, in, green, and, arabic, numerals, in, black, the, same, text, can, be, transliterated, to, the, latin, alphabet, r, maji, although, this, will, generally, only, be, done, for, the, convenience, of, foreign, language, speakers, translated, into, english, this, reads, all, words, in, modern, japanese, can, be, written, using, hiragana, katakana, and, r, maji, while, only, some, have, kanji, words, that, have, no, dedicated, kanji, may, still, be, written, with, kanji, by, employing, either, ateji, as, in, man, yogana, or, jukujikun, as, in, the, title, of, being, used, to, represent, although, rare, there, are, some, words, that, use, all, three, scripts, in, the, same, word, an, example, of, this, is, the, term, r, maji, kunoichi, which, uses, a, hiragana, a, katakana, and, a, kanji, character, in, that, order, it, is, said, that, if, all, three, characters, are, put, in, the, same, kanji, square, they, all, combine, to, create, the, kanji, woman, female, another, example, is, r, maji, keshigomu, which, means, eraser, and, uses, a, kanji, a, hiragana, and, two, katakana, characters, in, that, order, a, statistical, analysis, of, a, corpus, of, the, japanese, newspaper, asahi, shimbun, from, the, year, 1993, around, 56, 6, million, tokens, revealed, collation, word, ordering, in, japanese, is, based, on, the, kana, which, express, the, pronunciation, of, the, words, rather, than, the, kanji, the, kana, may, be, ordered, using, two, common, orderings, the, prevalent, goj, on, fifty, sound, ordering, or, the, old, fashioned, iroha, ordering, kanji, dictionaries, are, usually, collated, using, the, radical, system, though, other, systems, such, as, skip, also, exist, traditionally, japanese, is, written, in, a, format, called, tategaki, which, was, inherited, from, traditional, chinese, practice, in, this, format, the, characters, are, written, in, columns, going, from, top, to, bottom, with, columns, ordered, from, right, to, left, after, reaching, the, bottom, of, each, column, the, reader, continues, at, the, top, of, the, column, to, the, left, of, the, current, one, modern, japanese, also, uses, another, writing, format, called, yokogaki, this, writing, format, is, horizontal, and, reads, from, left, to, right, as, in, english, a, book, printed, in, tategaki, opens, with, the, spine, of, the, book, to, the, right, while, a, book, printed, in, yokogaki, opens, with, the, spine, to, the, left, japanese, is, normally, written, without, spaces, between, words, and, text, is, allowed, to, wrap, from, one, line, to, the, next, without, regard, for, word, boundaries, this, convention, was, originally, modelled, on, chinese, writing, where, spacing, is, superfluous, because, each, character, is, essentially, a, word, in, itself, albeit, compounds, are, common, however, in, kana, and, mixed, kana, kanji, text, readers, of, japanese, must, work, out, where, word, divisions, lie, based, on, an, understanding, of, what, makes, sense, for, example, must, be, mentally, divided, as, anata, wa, ok, san, ni, sokkuri, ne, you, re, just, like, your, mother, in, r, maji, it, may, sometimes, be, ambiguous, whether, an, item, should, be, transliterated, as, two, words, or, one, for, example, to, love, composed, of, ai, love, and, suru, here, a, verb, forming, suffix, is, variously, transliterated, as, aisuru, or, ai, suru, words, in, potentially, unfamiliar, foreign, compounds, normally, transliterated, in, katakana, may, be, separated, by, a, punctuation, mark, called, a, nakaguro, middle, dot, to, aid, japanese, readers, for, example, biru, geitsu, bill, gates, this, punctuation, is, also, occasionally, used, to, separate, native, japanese, words, especially, in, concatenations, of, kanji, characters, where, there, might, otherwise, be, confusion, or, ambiguity, about, interpretation, and, especially, for, the, full, names, of, people, the, japanese, full, stop, and, comma, are, used, for, similar, purposes, to, their, english, equivalents, though, comma, usage, can, be, more, fluid, than, is, the, case, in, english, the, question, mark, is, not, used, in, traditional, or, formal, japanese, but, it, may, be, used, in, informal, writing, or, in, transcriptions, of, dialogue, where, it, might, not, otherwise, be, clear, that, a, statement, was, intoned, as, a, question, the, exclamation, mark, is, restricted, to, informal, writing, colons, and, semicolons, are, available, but, are, not, common, in, ordinary, text, quotation, marks, are, written, as, and, nested, quotation, marks, as, several, bracket, styles, and, dashes, are, available, japan, s, first, encounters, with, chinese, characters, may, have, come, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, ad, with, the, king, of, na, gold, seal, said, to, have, been, given, by, emperor, guangwu, of, han, in, ad, 57, to, a, japanese, emissary, however, it, is, unlikely, that, the, japanese, became, literate, in, chinese, writing, any, earlier, than, the, 4th, century, ad, initially, chinese, characters, were, not, used, for, writing, japanese, as, literacy, meant, fluency, in, classical, chinese, not, the, vernacular, eventually, a, system, called, kanbun, developed, which, along, with, kanji, and, something, very, similar, to, chinese, grammar, employed, diacritics, to, hint, at, the, japanese, translation, the, earliest, written, history, of, japan, the, kojiki, compiled, sometime, before, 712, was, written, in, kanbun, even, today, japanese, high, schools, and, some, junior, high, schools, teach, kanbun, as, part, of, the, curriculum, no, full, fledged, script, for, written, japanese, existed, until, the, development, of, man, y, gana, which, appropriated, kanji, for, their, phonetic, value, derived, from, their, chinese, readings, rather, than, their, semantic, value, man, y, gana, was, initially, used, to, record, poetry, as, in, the, man, y, sh, compiled, sometime, before, 759, whence, the, writing, system, derives, its, name, some, scholars, claim, that, man, y, gana, originated, from, baekje, but, this, hypothesis, is, denied, by, mainstream, japanese, scholars, the, modern, kana, namely, hiragana, and, katakana, are, simplifications, and, systemizations, of, man, y, gana, due, to, the, large, number, of, words, and, concepts, entering, japan, from, china, which, had, no, native, equivalent, many, words, entered, japanese, directly, with, a, similar, pronunciation, to, the, original, chinese, this, chinese, derived, reading, is, known, as, on, yomi, and, this, vocabulary, as, a, whole, is, referred, to, as, sino, japanese, in, english, and, kango, in, japanese, at, the, same, time, native, japanese, already, had, words, corresponding, to, many, borrowed, kanji, authors, increasingly, used, kanji, to, represent, these, words, this, japanese, derived, reading, is, known, as, kun, yomi, a, kanji, may, have, none, one, or, several, on, yomi, and, kun, yomi, okurigana, are, written, after, the, initial, kanji, for, verbs, and, adjectives, to, give, inflection, and, to, help, disambiguate, a, particular, kanji, s, reading, the, same, character, may, be, read, several, different, ways, depending, on, the, word, for, example, the, character, is, read, i, as, the, first, syllable, of, iku, to, go, okona, as, the, first, three, syllables, of, okonau, to, carry, out, gy, in, the, compound, word, gy, retsu, line, or, procession, k, in, the, word, gink, bank, and, an, in, the, word, andon, lantern, some, linguists, have, compared, the, japanese, borrowing, of, chinese, derived, vocabulary, as, akin, to, the, influx, of, romance, vocabulary, into, english, during, the, norman, conquest, of, england, like, english, japanese, has, many, synonyms, of, differing, origin, with, words, from, both, chinese, and, native, japanese, sino, japanese, is, often, considered, more, formal, or, literary, just, as, latinate, words, in, english, often, mark, a, higher, register, the, significant, reforms, of, the, 19th, century, meiji, era, did, not, initially, impact, the, japanese, writing, system, however, the, language, itself, was, changing, due, to, the, increase, in, literacy, resulting, from, education, reforms, the, massive, influx, of, words, both, borrowed, from, other, languages, or, newly, coined, and, the, ultimate, success, of, movements, such, as, the, influential, genbun, itchi, which, resulted, in, japanese, being, written, in, the, colloquial, form, of, the, language, instead, of, the, wide, range, of, historical, and, classical, styles, used, previously, the, difficulty, of, written, japanese, was, a, topic, of, debate, with, several, proposals, in, the, late, 19th, century, that, the, number, of, kanji, in, use, be, limited, in, addition, exposure, to, non, japanese, texts, led, to, unsuccessful, proposals, that, japanese, be, written, entirely, in, kana, or, r, maji, this, period, saw, western, style, punctuation, marks, introduced, into, japanese, writing, in, 1900, the, education, ministry, introduced, three, reforms, aimed, at, improving, the, process, of, education, in, japanese, writing, the, first, two, of, these, were, generally, accepted, but, the, third, was, hotly, contested, particularly, by, conservatives, to, the, extent, that, it, was, withdrawn, in, 1908, the, partial, failure, of, the, 1900, reforms, combined, with, the, rise, of, nationalism, in, japan, effectively, prevented, further, significant, reform, of, the, writing, system, the, period, before, world, war, ii, saw, numerous, proposals, to, restrict, the, number, of, kanji, in, use, and, several, newspapers, voluntarily, restricted, their, kanji, usage, and, increased, usage, of, furigana, however, there, was, no, official, endorsement, of, these, and, indeed, much, opposition, however, one, successful, reform, was, the, standardization, of, hiragana, which, involved, reducing, the, possibilities, of, writing, down, japanese, morae, down, to, only, one, hiragana, character, per, morae, which, led, to, labeling, all, the, other, previously, used, hiragana, as, hentaigana, and, discarding, them, in, daily, use, the, period, immediately, following, world, war, ii, saw, a, rapid, and, significant, reform, of, the, writing, system, this, was, in, part, due, to, influence, of, the, occupation, authorities, but, to, a, significant, extent, was, due, to, the, removal, of, traditionalists, from, control, of, the, educational, system, which, meant, that, previously, stalled, revisions, could, proceed, the, major, reforms, were, at, one, stage, an, advisor, in, the, occupation, administration, proposed, a, wholesale, conversion, to, r, maji, but, it, was, not, endorsed, by, other, specialists, and, did, not, proceed, in, addition, the, practice, of, writing, horizontally, in, a, right, to, left, direction, was, generally, replaced, by, left, to, right, writing, the, right, to, left, order, was, considered, a, special, case, of, vertical, writing, with, columns, one, character, high, rather, than, horizontal, writing, per, se, it, was, used, for, single, lines, of, text, on, signs, etc, e, g, the, station, sign, at, tokyo, reads, which, is, from, right, to, left, the, post, war, reforms, have, mostly, survived, although, some, of, the, restrictions, have, been, relaxed, the, replacement, of, the, t, y, kanji, in, 1981, with, the, 1, 945, j, y, kanji, a, modification, of, the, t, y, kanji, was, accompanied, by, a, change, from, restriction, to, recommendation, and, in, general, the, educational, authorities, have, become, less, active, in, further, script, reform, in, 2004, the, jinmeiy, kanji, maintained, by, the, ministry, of, justice, for, use, in, personal, names, was, significantly, enlarged, the, j, y, kanji, list, was, extended, to, 2, 136, characters, in, 2010, there, are, a, number, of, methods, of, rendering, japanese, in, roman, letters, the, hepburn, method, of, romanization, designed, for, english, speakers, is, a, de, facto, standard, widely, used, inside, and, outside, japan, the, kunrei, shiki, system, has, a, better, correspondence, with, japanese, phonology, which, makes, it, easier, for, native, speakers, to, learn, it, is, officially, endorsed, by, the, ministry, of, education, and, often, used, by, non, native, speakers, who, are, learning, japanese, as, a, second, language, other, systems, of, romanization, include, nihon, shiki, jsl, and, w, puro, r, maji
