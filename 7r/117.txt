work, or, labor, or, labour, in, british, english, is, the, intentional, activity, people, perform, to, support, the, needs, and, wants, of, themselves, others, or, a, wider, community, in, the, context, of, economics, work, can, be, viewed, as, the, human, activity, that, contributes, along, with, other, factors, of, production, towards, the, goods, and, services, within, an, economy, work, is, fundamental, to, all, societies, but, can, vary, widely, within, and, between, them, from, gathering, natural, resources, by, hand, to, operating, complex, technologies, that, substitute, for, physical, or, even, mental, effort, by, many, human, beings, all, but, the, simplest, tasks, also, require, specific, skills, equipment, or, tools, and, other, resources, such, as, material, for, manufacturing, goods, cultures, and, individuals, across, history, have, expressed, a, wide, range, of, attitudes, towards, work, outside, of, any, specific, process, or, industry, humanity, has, developed, a, variety, of, institutions, for, situating, work, in, society, as, humans, are, diurnal, they, work, mainly, during, the, day, besides, objective, differences, one, culture, may, organize, or, attach, social, status, to, work, roles, differently, from, another, throughout, history, work, has, been, intimately, connected, with, other, aspects, of, society, and, politics, such, as, power, class, tradition, rights, and, privileges, accordingly, the, division, of, labour, is, a, prominent, topic, across, the, social, sciences, as, both, an, abstract, concept, and, a, characteristic, of, individual, cultures, some, people, have, also, engaged, in, critique, of, work, and, expressed, a, wish, to, abolish, it, e, g, paul, lafargue, in, his, book, the, right, to, be, lazy, related, terms, include, occupation, and, job, related, concepts, are, job, title, and, profession, work, can, take, many, different, forms, as, varied, as, the, environments, tools, skills, goals, and, institutions, around, a, worker, this, term, refers, to, the, general, activity, of, performing, tasks, whether, they, are, paid, or, unpaid, formal, or, informal, work, encompasses, all, types, of, productive, activities, including, employment, household, chores, volunteering, and, creative, pursuits, it, is, a, broad, term, that, encompasses, any, effort, or, activity, directed, towards, achieving, a, particular, goal, because, sustained, effort, is, a, necessary, part, of, many, human, activities, what, qualifies, as, work, is, often, a, matter, of, context, specialization, is, one, common, feature, that, distinguishes, work, from, other, activities, for, example, a, sport, is, a, job, for, a, professional, athlete, who, earns, their, livelihood, from, it, but, a, hobby, for, someone, playing, for, fun, in, their, community, an, element, of, advance, planning, or, expectation, is, also, common, such, as, when, a, paramedic, provides, medical, care, while, on, duty, and, fully, equipped, rather, than, performing, first, aid, off, duty, as, a, bystander, in, an, emergency, self, care, and, basic, habits, like, personal, grooming, are, also, not, typically, considered, work, while, a, later, gift, trade, or, payment, may, retroactively, affirm, an, activity, as, productive, this, can, exclude, work, like, volunteering, or, activities, within, a, family, setting, like, parenting, or, housekeeping, in, some, cases, the, distinction, between, work, and, other, activities, is, simply, a, matter, of, common, sense, within, a, community, however, an, alternative, view, is, that, labeling, any, activity, as, work, is, somewhat, subjective, as, mark, twain, expressed, in, the, whitewashed, fence, scene, of, the, adventures, of, tom, sawyer, humans, have, varied, their, work, habits, and, attitudes, over, time, hunter, gatherer, societies, vary, their, work, intensity, according, to, the, seasonal, availability, of, plants, and, the, periodic, migration, of, prey, animals, the, development, of, agriculture, led, to, more, sustained, work, practices, but, work, still, changed, with, the, seasons, with, intense, sustained, effort, during, harvests, for, example, alternating, with, less, focused, periods, such, as, winters, in, the, early, modern, era, protestantism, and, proto, capitalism, emphasized, the, moral, and, personal, advantages, of, hard, work, the, periodic, re, invention, of, slavery, encouraged, more, consistent, work, activity, in, the, working, class, and, capitalist, industrialization, intensified, demands, on, workers, to, keep, up, with, the, pace, of, machines, restrictions, on, the, hours, of, work, and, the, ages, of, workers, followed, with, worker, demands, for, time, off, increasing, but, modern, office, work, retains, traces, of, expectations, of, sustained, concentrated, work, even, in, affluent, societies, there, are, several, ways, to, categorize, and, compare, different, kinds, of, work, in, economics, one, popular, approach, is, the, three, sector, model, or, variations, of, it, in, this, view, an, economy, can, be, separated, into, three, broad, categories, in, complex, economies, with, high, specialization, these, categories, are, further, subdivided, into, industries, that, produce, a, focused, subset, of, products, or, services, some, economists, also, propose, additional, sectors, such, as, a, knowledge, based, quaternary, sector, but, this, division, is, neither, standardized, nor, universally, accepted, another, common, way, of, contrasting, work, roles, is, ranking, them, according, to, a, criterion, such, as, the, amount, of, skill, experience, or, seniority, associated, with, a, role, the, progression, from, apprentice, through, journeyman, to, master, craftsman, in, the, skilled, trades, is, one, example, with, a, long, history, and, analogs, in, many, cultures, societies, also, commonly, rank, different, work, roles, by, perceived, status, but, this, is, more, subjective, and, goes, beyond, clear, progressions, within, a, single, industry, some, industries, may, be, seen, as, more, prestigious, than, others, overall, even, if, they, include, roles, with, similar, functions, at, the, same, time, a, wide, swathe, of, roles, across, all, industries, may, be, afforded, more, status, e, g, managerial, roles, or, less, like, manual, labor, based, on, characteristics, such, as, a, job, being, low, paid, or, dirty, dangerous, and, demeaning, other, social, dynamics, like, how, labor, is, compensated, can, even, exclude, meaningful, tasks, from, a, society, s, conception, of, work, for, example, in, modern, market, economies, where, wage, labor, or, piece, work, predominates, unpaid, work, may, be, omitted, from, economic, analysis, or, even, cultural, ideas, of, what, qualifies, as, work, at, a, political, level, different, roles, can, fall, under, separate, institutions, where, workers, have, qualitatively, different, power, or, rights, in, the, extreme, the, least, powerful, members, of, society, may, be, stigmatized, as, in, untouchability, or, even, violently, forced, via, slavery, into, performing, the, least, desirable, work, complementary, to, this, elites, may, have, exclusive, access, to, the, most, prestigious, work, largely, symbolic, sinecures, or, even, a, life, of, leisure, unusual, occupations, in, the, diverse, world, of, work, there, exist, some, truly, bizarre, and, unusual, occupations, that, often, defy, conventional, expectations, these, unique, jobs, showcase, the, creativity, and, adaptability, of, humans, in, their, pursuit, of, livelihood, individual, workers, require, sufficient, health, and, resources, to, succeed, in, their, tasks, as, living, beings, humans, require, a, baseline, of, good, health, nutrition, rest, and, other, physical, needs, in, order, to, reliably, exert, themselves, this, is, particularly, true, of, physical, labor, that, places, direct, demands, on, the, body, but, even, largely, mental, work, can, cause, stress, from, problems, like, long, hours, excessive, demands, or, a, hostile, workplace, particularly, intense, forms, of, manual, labor, often, lead, workers, to, develop, physical, strength, necessary, for, their, job, however, this, activity, does, not, necessarily, improve, a, worker, s, overall, physical, fitness, like, exercise, due, to, problems, like, overwork, or, a, small, set, of, repetitive, motions, in, these, physical, jobs, maintaining, good, posture, or, movements, with, proper, technique, is, also, a, crucial, skill, for, avoiding, injury, ironically, white, collar, workers, who, are, sedentary, throughout, the, workday, may, also, suffer, from, long, term, health, problems, due, to, a, lack, of, physical, activity, learning, the, necessary, skills, for, work, is, often, a, complex, process, in, its, own, right, requiring, intentional, training, in, traditional, societies, know, how, for, different, tasks, can, be, passed, to, each, new, generation, through, oral, tradition, and, working, under, adult, guidance, for, work, that, is, more, specialized, and, technically, complex, however, a, more, formal, system, of, education, is, usually, necessary, a, complete, curriculum, ensures, that, a, worker, in, training, has, some, exposure, to, all, major, aspects, of, their, specialty, in, both, theory, and, practice, tool, use, has, been, a, central, aspect, of, human, evolution, and, is, also, an, essential, feature, of, work, even, in, technologically, advanced, societies, many, workers, toolsets, still, include, a, number, of, smaller, hand, tools, designed, to, be, held, and, operated, by, a, single, person, often, without, supplementary, power, this, is, especially, true, when, tasks, can, be, handled, by, one, or, a, few, workers, do, not, require, significant, physical, power, and, are, somewhat, self, paced, like, in, many, services, or, handicraft, manufacturing, for, other, tasks, needing, large, amounts, of, power, such, as, in, the, construction, industry, or, involving, a, highly, repetitive, set, of, simple, actions, like, in, mass, manufacturing, complex, machines, can, carry, out, much, of, the, effort, the, workers, present, will, focus, on, more, complex, tasks, operating, controls, or, performing, maintenance, over, several, millennia, invention, scientific, discovery, and, engineering, principles, have, allowed, humans, to, proceed, from, creating, simple, machines, that, merely, redirect, or, amplify, force, through, engines, for, harnessing, supplementary, power, sources, to, today, s, complex, regulated, systems, that, automate, many, steps, within, a, work, process, in, the, 20th, century, the, development, of, electronics, and, new, mathematical, insights, led, to, the, creation, and, widespread, adoption, of, fast, general, purpose, computers, just, as, mechanization, can, substitute, for, the, physical, labor, of, many, human, beings, computers, allow, for, the, partial, automation, of, mental, work, previously, carried, out, by, human, workers, such, as, calculations, document, transcription, and, basic, customer, service, requests, research, and, development, of, related, technologies, like, machine, learning, and, robotics, continues, into, the, 21st, century, beyond, tools, and, machines, used, to, actively, perform, tasks, workers, benefit, when, other, passive, elements, of, their, work, and, environment, are, designed, properly, this, includes, everything, from, personal, items, like, workwear, and, safety, gear, to, features, of, the, workspace, itself, like, furniture, lighting, air, quality, and, even, the, underlying, architecture, even, if, workers, are, personally, ready, to, perform, their, jobs, coordination, is, required, for, any, effort, outside, of, individual, subsistence, to, succeed, at, the, level, of, a, small, team, working, on, a, single, task, only, cooperation, and, good, communication, may, be, necessary, as, the, complexity, of, a, work, process, increases, though, requiring, more, planning, or, more, workers, focused, on, specific, tasks, a, reliable, organization, becomes, more, critical, economic, organizations, often, reflect, social, thought, common, to, their, time, and, place, such, as, ideas, about, human, nature, or, hierarchy, these, unique, organizations, can, also, be, historically, significant, even, forming, major, pillars, of, an, economic, system, in, european, history, for, instance, the, decline, of, guilds, and, rise, of, joint, stock, companies, goes, hand, in, hand, with, other, changes, like, the, growth, of, centralized, states, and, capitalism, in, industrialized, economies, labor, unions, are, another, significant, organization, in, isolation, a, worker, that, is, easily, replaceable, in, the, labor, market, has, little, power, to, demand, better, wages, or, conditions, by, banding, together, and, interacting, with, business, owners, as, a, corporate, entity, the, same, workers, can, claim, a, larger, share, of, the, value, created, by, their, labor, while, a, union, does, require, workers, to, sacrifice, some, autonomy, in, relation, to, their, coworkers, it, can, grant, workers, more, control, over, the, work, process, itself, in, addition, to, material, benefits, the, need, for, planning, and, coordination, extends, beyond, individual, organizations, to, society, as, a, whole, too, every, successful, work, project, requires, effective, resource, allocation, to, provide, necessities, materials, and, investment, such, as, equipment, and, facilities, in, smaller, traditional, societies, these, aspects, can, be, mostly, regulated, through, custom, though, as, societies, grow, more, extensive, methods, become, necessary, these, complex, institutions, however, still, have, roots, in, common, human, activities, even, the, free, markets, of, modern, capitalist, societies, rely, fundamentally, on, trade, while, command, economies, such, as, in, many, communist, states, during, the, 20th, century, rely, on, a, highly, bureaucratic, and, hierarchical, form, of, redistribution, other, institutions, can, affect, workers, even, more, directly, by, delimiting, practical, day, to, day, life, or, basic, legal, rights, for, example, a, caste, system, may, restrict, families, to, a, narrow, range, of, jobs, inherited, from, parent, to, child, in, serfdom, a, peasant, has, more, rights, than, a, slave, but, is, attached, to, a, specific, piece, of, land, and, largely, under, the, power, of, the, landholder, even, requiring, permission, to, physically, travel, outside, the, land, holding, how, institutions, play, out, in, individual, workers, lives, can, be, complex, too, in, most, societies, where, wage, labor, predominates, workers, possess, equal, rights, by, law, and, mobility, in, theory, without, social, support, or, other, resources, however, the, necessity, of, earning, a, livelihood, may, force, a, worker, to, cede, some, rights, and, freedoms, in, fact, societies, and, subcultures, may, value, work, in, general, or, specific, kinds, of, it, very, differently, when, social, status, or, virtue, is, strongly, associated, with, leisure, and, opposed, to, tedium, then, work, itself, can, become, indicative, of, low, social, rank, and, be, devalued, in, the, opposite, case, a, society, may, hold, strongly, to, a, work, ethic, where, work, itself, is, seen, as, virtuous, for, example, german, sociologist, max, weber, hypothesized, that, european, capitalism, originated, in, a, protestant, work, ethic, which, emerged, with, the, reformation, many, christian, theologians, appeal, to, the, old, testament, s, book, of, genesis, in, regards, to, work, according, to, genesis, 1, human, beings, were, created, in, the, image, of, god, and, according, to, genesis, 2, adam, was, placed, in, the, garden, of, eden, to, work, it, and, keep, it, dorothy, l, sayers, has, argued, that, work, is, the, natural, exercise, and, function, of, man, the, creature, who, is, made, in, the, image, of, his, creator, likewise, john, paul, ii, said, in, laborem, exercens, that, by, his, work, man, shares, in, the, image, of, his, creator, christian, theologians, see, the, fall, of, man, as, profoundly, affecting, human, work, in, genesis, 3, 17, god, said, to, adam, cursed, is, the, ground, because, of, you, in, pain, you, shall, eat, of, it, all, the, days, of, your, life, leland, ryken, said, out, that, because, of, the, fall, many, of, the, tasks, we, perform, in, a, fallen, world, are, inherently, distasteful, and, wearisome, christian, theologians, interpret, that, through, the, fall, work, has, become, toil, but, john, paul, ii, says, that, work, is, a, good, thing, for, man, in, spite, of, this, toil, and, that, perhaps, in, a, sense, because, of, it, because, work, is, something, that, corresponds, to, man, s, dignity, and, through, it, he, achieves, fulfilment, as, a, human, being, the, fall, also, means, that, a, work, ethic, is, needed, as, a, result, of, the, fall, work, has, become, subject, to, the, abuses, of, idleness, on, the, one, hand, and, overwork, on, the, other, drawing, on, aristotle, ryken, suggests, that, the, moral, ideal, is, the, golden, mean, between, the, two, extremes, of, being, lazy, and, being, a, workaholic, some, christian, theologians, also, draw, on, the, doctrine, of, redemption, to, discuss, the, concept, of, work, oliver, o, donovan, said, that, although, work, is, a, gift, of, creation, it, is, ennobled, into, mutual, service, in, the, fellowship, of, christ, pope, francis, is, critical, of, the, hope, that, technological, progress, might, eliminate, or, diminish, the, need, for, work, the, goal, should, not, be, that, technological, progress, increasingly, replace, human, work, for, this, would, be, detrimental, to, humanity, and, mckinsey, consultants, suggest, that, work, will, change, but, not, end, as, a, result, of, automation, and, the, increasing, adoption, of, artificial, intelligence, for, some, work, may, hold, a, spiritual, value, in, addition, to, any, secular, notions, especially, in, some, monastic, or, mystical, strands, of, several, religions, simple, manual, labor, may, be, held, in, high, regard, as, a, way, to, maintain, the, body, cultivate, self, discipline, and, humility, and, focus, the, mind, the, contemporary, world, economy, has, brought, many, changes, overturning, some, previously, widespread, labor, issues, at, the, same, time, some, longstanding, issues, remain, relevant, and, other, new, ones, have, emerged, one, issue, that, continues, despite, many, improvements, is, slave, labor, and, human, trafficking, though, ideas, about, universal, rights, and, the, economic, benefits, of, free, labor, have, significantly, diminished, the, prevalence, of, outright, slavery, it, continues, in, lawless, areas, or, in, attenuated, forms, on, the, margins, of, many, economies, another, difficulty, which, has, emerged, in, most, societies, as, a, result, of, urbanization, and, industrialization, is, unemployment, while, the, shift, from, a, subsistence, economy, usually, increases, the, overall, productivity, of, society, and, lifts, many, out, of, poverty, it, removes, a, baseline, of, material, security, from, those, who, cannot, find, employment, or, other, support, governments, have, tried, a, range, of, strategies, to, mitigate, the, problem, such, as, improving, the, efficiency, of, job, matching, conditionally, providing, welfare, benefits, or, unemployment, insurance, or, even, directly, overriding, the, labor, market, through, work, relief, programs, or, a, job, guarantee, since, a, job, forms, a, major, part, of, many, workers, self, identity, unemployment, can, have, severe, psychological, and, social, consequences, beyond, the, financial, insecurity, it, causes, one, more, issue, which, may, not, directly, interfere, with, the, functioning, of, an, economy, but, can, have, significant, indirect, effects, is, when, governments, fail, to, account, for, work, occurring, out, of, view, from, the, public, sphere, this, may, be, important, uncompensated, work, occurring, everyday, in, private, life, or, it, may, be, criminal, activity, that, involves, clear, but, furtive, economic, exchanges, by, ignoring, or, failing, to, understand, these, activities, economic, policies, can, have, counter, intuitive, effects, and, cause, strains, on, the, community, and, society, due, to, various, reasons, such, as, the, cheap, labour, the, poor, economic, situation, of, the, deprived, classes, the, weakness, of, laws, and, legal, supervision, the, migration, existence, of, child, labour, is, very, much, observed, in, different, parts, of, the, world, according, to, the, world, bank, globally, rate, of, child, labour, have, decreased, from, 25, to, 10, between, 60s, to, the, early, years, of, the, 21st, century, nevertheless, giving, the, population, of, the, world, also, increased, the, total, number, of, child, labourers, remains, high, with, unicef, and, ilo, acknowledging, an, estimated, 168, million, children, aged, 5, 17, worldwide, were, involved, in, some, sort, of, child, labour, in, 2013, some, scholars, like, jean, marie, baland, and, james, a, robinson, suggests, any, labour, by, children, aged, 18, years, or, less, is, wrong, since, this, encourages, illiteracy, inhumane, work, and, lower, investment, in, human, capital, in, other, words, there, are, moral, and, economic, reasons, that, justify, a, blanket, ban, on, labour, from, children, aged, 18, years, or, less, everywhere, in, the, world, on, the, other, hand, some, scholars, like, christiaan, grootaert, and, kameel, ahmady, believe, that, child, labour, is, the, symptom, of, poverty, if, laws, ban, most, lawful, work, that, enables, the, poor, to, survive, informal, economy, illicit, operations, and, underground, businesses, will, thrive, in, modern, market, economies, labor, issues, related, concepts
