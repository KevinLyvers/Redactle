southern, kazakh, and, western, kazakh, the, language, shares, a, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, with, closely, related, karakalpak, while, its, western, dialects, maintain, limited, mutual, intelligibility, with, altai, languages, in, october, 2017, kazakh, president, nursultan, nazarbayev, decreed, that, the, writing, system, would, change, from, using, cyrillic, to, latin, script, by, 2025, the, proposed, latin, alphabet, has, been, revised, several, times, and, as, of, january, 2021, is, close, to, the, inventory, of, the, turkish, alphabet, though, lacking, the, letters, c, and, and, having, four, additional, letters, q, and, though, other, letters, such, as, y, have, different, values, in, the, two, languages, it, is, scheduled, to, be, phased, in, from, 2023, to, 2031, speakers, of, kazakh, mainly, kazakhs, are, spread, over, a, vast, territory, from, the, tian, shan, to, the, western, shore, of, the, caspian, sea, kazakh, is, the, official, state, language, of, kazakhstan, with, nearly, 10, million, speakers, based, on, information, from, the, cia, world, factbook, on, population, and, proportion, of, kazakh, speakers, in, china, nearly, two, million, ethnic, kazakhs, and, kazakh, speakers, reside, in, the, ili, kazakh, autonomous, prefecture, of, xinjiang, the, kipchak, branch, of, turkic, languages, which, kazakh, is, borne, out, of, was, mainly, solidified, during, the, reign, of, the, golden, horde, the, modern, kazakh, language, is, said, to, have, originated, in, approximately, 1465, ad, during, the, formation, of, the, kazakh, khanate, modern, kazakh, is, likely, a, descendant, of, both, chagatay, turkic, as, spoken, by, the, timurids, and, kipchak, turkic, as, spoken, in, the, golden, horde, kazakh, uses, a, high, volume, of, loanwords, from, persian, and, arabic, due, to, the, frequent, historical, interactions, between, kazakhs, and, iranian, ethnic, groups, to, the, south, additionally, persian, was, a, lingua, franca, in, the, kazakh, khanate, which, allowed, kazakhs, to, mix, persian, words, into, their, own, spoken, and, written, vernacular, meanwhile, arabic, was, used, by, kazakhs, in, mosques, and, mausoleums, serving, as, a, language, exclusively, for, religious, contexts, similar, to, how, latin, served, as, a, liturgical, language, in, the, european, cultural, sphere, the, kazakhs, used, the, arabic, script, to, write, their, language, until, approximately, 1929, in, the, early, 1900s, kazakh, activist, akhmet, baitursynuly, reformed, the, kazakh, arabic, alphabet, but, his, work, was, largely, overshadowed, by, the, soviet, presence, in, central, asia, at, that, point, the, new, soviet, regime, forced, the, kazakhs, to, use, a, latin, script, and, then, a, cyrillic, script, in, the, 1940s, today, kazakhs, use, the, cyrillic, and, latin, scripts, to, write, their, language, although, a, presidential, decree, from, 2017, ordered, the, transition, from, cyrillic, to, latin, by, 2031, kazakh, exhibits, tongue, root, vowel, harmony, with, some, words, of, recent, foreign, origin, usually, of, russian, or, arabic, origin, as, exceptions, there, is, also, a, system, of, rounding, harmony, which, resembles, that, of, kyrgyz, but, which, does, not, apply, as, strongly, and, is, not, reflected, in, the, orthography, this, system, only, applies, to, the, open, vowels, e, and, not, and, happens, in, the, next, syllables, thus, in, latin, script, j, ldyz, star, b, g, n, today, and, lken, big, are, actually, pronounced, as, j, ld, z, b, g, n, lk, n, the, following, chart, depicts, the, consonant, inventory, of, standard, kazakh, many, of, the, sounds, however, are, allophones, of, other, sounds, or, appear, only, in, recent, loanwords, the, 18, consonant, phonemes, listed, by, vajda, are, without, parentheses, since, these, are, phonemes, their, listed, place, and, manner, of, articulation, are, very, general, and, will, vary, from, what, is, shown, t, s, rarely, appears, in, normal, speech, kazakh, has, 19, native, consonant, phonemes, these, are, the, stops, p, b, t, d, k, q, fricatives, s, z, nasals, m, n, liquids, l, and, two, glides, w, j, the, sounds, f, v, h, t, s, t, are, found, only, in, loanwords, is, heard, as, an, alveolopalatal, affricate, in, the, kazakh, dialects, of, uzbekistan, and, xinjiang, china, the, sounds, and, may, be, analyzed, as, allophones, of, k, and, in, words, with, back, vowels, but, exceptions, occur, in, loanwords, kazakh, has, a, system, of, 12, phonemic, vowels, 3, of, which, are, diphthongs, the, rounding, contrast, and, generally, only, occur, as, phonemes, in, the, first, syllable, of, a, word, but, do, occur, later, allophonically, see, the, section, on, harmony, below, for, more, information, moreover, the, sound, has, been, included, artificially, due, to, the, influence, of, arabic, persian, and, later, tatar, languages, during, the, islamic, period, it, can, be, found, in, some, native, words, however, according, to, vajda, the, front, back, quality, of, vowels, is, actually, one, of, neutral, versus, retracted, tongue, root, phonetic, values, are, paired, with, the, corresponding, character, in, kazakh, s, cyrillic, and, current, latin, alphabets, kazakh, exhibits, tongue, root, vowel, harmony, also, called, soft, hard, harmony, and, arguably, weakened, rounding, harmony, which, is, implied, in, the, first, syllable, of, the, word, all, vowels, after, the, first, rounded, syllable, are, the, subject, to, this, harmony, with, the, exception, of, and, in, the, following, syllables, e, g, notably, urban, kazakh, tends, to, violate, rounding, harmony, as, well, as, pronouncing, russian, borrowings, against, the, rules, most, words, in, kazakh, are, stressed, in, the, last, syllable, except, nowadays, kazakh, is, mostly, written, in, the, cyrillic, script, with, an, arabic, based, alphabet, being, used, by, minorities, in, china, since, 26, october, 2017, via, presidential, decree, 569, kazakhstan, will, adopt, the, latin, script, by, 2025, cyrillic, script, was, created, to, better, merge, the, kazakh, language, with, other, languages, of, the, ussr, hence, it, has, some, controversial, letter, readings, the, letter, after, a, consonant, represents, a, combination, of, sounds, with, glide, w, e, g, undergoes, the, same, process, but, with, j, at, the, beginning, the, letter, represents, a, combination, of, sounds, i, in, front, vowel, contexts, or, in, back, vowel, contexts, glide, j, e, g, in, russian, loanwords, it, is, realized, as, i, when, stressed, or, when, unstressed, e, g, the, letter, represents, either, j, or, j, depending, on, vowel, harmony, the, letter, represents, e, g, meanwhile, the, letters, are, only, used, in, loanwords, mostly, those, of, russian, origin, but, sometimes, of, persian, and, arabic, origin, they, are, often, substituted, in, spoken, kazakh, kazakh, is, generally, verb, final, though, various, permutations, on, sov, subject, object, verb, word, order, can, be, used, for, example, due, to, topicalization, inflectional, and, derivational, morphology, both, verbal, and, nominal, in, kazakh, exists, almost, exclusively, in, the, form, of, agglutinative, suffixes, kazakh, is, a, nominative, accusative, head, final, left, branching, dependent, marking, language, kazakh, has, no, noun, class, or, gender, system, nouns, are, declined, for, number, singular, or, plural, and, one, of, seven, cases, the, suffix, for, case, is, placed, before, the, suffix, for, number, forms, child, hedgehog, kazakh, school, person, flower, word, there, are, eight, personal, pronouns, in, kazakh, the, declension, of, the, pronouns, is, outlined, in, the, following, chart, singular, pronouns, exhibit, irregularities, while, plural, pronouns, do, not, irregular, forms, are, highlighted, in, bold, in, addition, to, the, pronouns, there, are, several, more, sets, of, morphemes, dealing, with, person, adjectives, in, kazakh, are, not, declined, for, any, grammatical, category, of, the, modified, noun, being, a, head, final, language, adjectives, are, always, placed, before, the, noun, that, they, modify, kazakh, has, two, varieties, of, adjectives, the, comparative, form, can, be, created, by, appending, the, suffix, y, raq, rek, or, tau, teu, dau, dau, to, an, adjective, the, superlative, form, can, be, created, by, placing, the, morpheme, e, before, the, adjective, kazakh, may, express, different, combinations, of, tense, aspect, and, mood, through, the, use, of, various, verbal, morphology, or, through, a, system, of, auxiliary, verbs, many, of, which, might, better, be, considered, light, verbs, the, present, tense, is, a, prime, example, of, this, progressive, tense, in, kazakh, is, formed, with, one, of, four, possible, auxiliaries, these, auxiliaries, otyr, sit, t, r, stand, j, r, go, and, jat, lie, encode, various, shades, of, meaning, of, how, the, action, is, carried, out, and, also, interact, with, the, lexical, semantics, of, the, root, verb, telic, and, non, telic, actions, semelfactives, durative, and, non, durative, punctual, etc, there, are, selectional, restrictions, on, auxiliaries, motion, verbs, such, as, go, and, come, may, not, combine, with, otyr, any, verb, however, can, combine, with, jat, lie, to, get, a, progressive, tense, meaning, while, it, is, possible, to, think, that, different, categories, of, aspect, govern, the, choice, of, auxiliary, it, is, not, so, straightforward, in, kazakh, auxiliaries, are, internally, sensitive, to, the, lexical, semantics, of, predicates, for, example, verbs, describing, motion, suda, water, loc, balyq, fish, j, zed, swim, pres, 3, suda, balyq, j, zed, water, loc, fish, swim, pres, 3, fish, swim, in, water, general, statement, suda, water, loc, balyq, fish, j, z, p, swim, cvb, jatyr, aux, 3, suda, balyq, j, z, p, jatyr, water, loc, fish, swim, cvb, aux, 3, the,

the, water, suda, water, loc, balyq, fish, j, z, p, swim, cvb, t, r, aux, 3, suda, balyq, j, z, p, t, r, water, loc, fish, swim, cvb, aux, 3, the, fish, is, swimming, in, the, water, suda, water, loc, balyq, fish, j, z, p, swim, cvb, otyr, aux, 3, suda, balyq, j, z, p, otyr, water, loc, fish, swim, cvb, aux, 3, the, fish, has, been, swimming, not, a, possible, sentence, in, kazakh, in, addition, to, the, complexities, of, the, progressive, tense, there, are, many, auxiliary, converb, pairs, that, encode, a, range, of, aspectual, modal, volitional, evidential, and, action, modificational, meanings, for, example, the, pattern, verb, k, ru, with, the, auxiliary, verb, k, ru, see, indicates, that, the, subject, of, the, verb, attempted, or, tried, to, do, something, compare, the, japanese, temiru, construction, from, the, first, stanza, and, refrain, of, men, qazaqstanym, my, kazakhstan, the, national, anthem, of, kazakhstan, altyn, gold, k, n, sun, aspan, y, sky, 3, poss,
