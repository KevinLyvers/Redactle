conscientiousness, is, the, personality, trait, of, being, responsible, careful, or, diligent, conscientiousness, implies, a, desire, to, do, a, task, well, and, to, take, obligations, to, others, seriously, conscientious, people, tend, to, be, efficient, and, organized, as, opposed, to, easy, going, and, disorderly, they, tend, to, show, self, discipline, act, dutifully, and, aim, for, achievement, they, display, planned, rather, than, spontaneous, behavior, and, they, are, generally, dependable, conscientiousness, manifests, in, characteristic, behaviors, such, as, being, neat, systematic, careful, thorough, and, deliberate, tending, to, think, carefully, before, acting, conscientiousness, is, one, of, the, five, traits, of, both, the, five, factor, model, and, the, hexaco, model, of, personality, and, is, an, aspect, of, what, has, traditionally, been, referred, to, as, having, character, conscientious, individuals, are, generally, hard, working, and, reliable, when, taken, to, an, extreme, they, may, also, be, workaholics, perfectionists, and, compulsive, in, their, behavior, people, who, score, low, on, conscientiousness, tend, to, be, laid, back, less, goal, oriented, and, less, driven, by, success, if, they, also, score, high, on, big, five, agreeableness, otherwise, they, are, also, more, likely, to, engage, in, anti, social, behavior, and, commit, blue, collared, crimes, and, crimes, of, passion, conscientiousness, is, one, of, the, five, major, dimensions, in, the, big, five, model, of, personality, also, called, five, factor, model, or, ocean, which, consists, of, openness, to, experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and, neuroticism, two, of, many, personality, tests, that, assess, these, traits, are, costa, and, mccrae, s, neo, pi, r, and, goldberg, s, neo, ipip, according, to, these, models, conscientiousness, is, a, continuous, dimension, of, personality, rather, than, a, categorical, type, of, person, in, the, neo, framework, conscientiousness, has, six, facets, competence, order, dutifulness, achievement, striving, self, discipline, and, deliberation, other, models, suggest, a, smaller, set, of, two, aspects, orderliness, and, industriousness, form, an, intermediate, level, of, organization, with, orderliness, associated, with, the, desire, to, keep, things, organized, and, tidy, and, industriousness, being, more, associated, with, productivity, and, work, ethic, other, big, five, personality, traits, such, as, low, extraversion, high, agreeableness, low, openness, and, low, neuroticism, are, linked, to, high, conscientiousness, conscientiousness, also, appears, in, other, models, of, personality, such, as, cloninger, s, temperament, and, character, inventory, in, which, it, is, related, to, both, self, directedness, and, persistence, the, traits, of, rule, consciousness, and, perfectionism, are, included, in, cattell, s, 16, pf, model, it, is, negatively, associated, with, impulsive, sensation, seeking, in, zuckerman, s, alternative, five, model, traits, associated, with, conscientiousness, are, frequently, assessed, by, self, report, integrity, tests, given, by, various, corporations, to, prospective, employees, terms, such, as, hard, working, reliable, and, persevering, describe, desirable, aspects, of, character, because, conscientiousness, was, once, believed, to, be, a, moral, evaluation, it, was, overlooked, as, a, psychological, attribute, the, reality, of, individual, differences, in, conscientiousness, has, now, been, clearly, established, by, studies, of, cross, observer, agreement, peer, and, expert, ratings, confirm, the, self, reports, that, people, make, about, their, degrees, of, conscientiousness, furthermore, both, self, reports, and, observer, ratings, of, conscientiousness, predict, real, life, outcomes, such, as, academic, success, during, most, of, the, 20th, century, psychologists, believed, that, personality, traits, could, be, divided, into, two, categories, temperament, and, character, temperament, traits, were, thought, to, be, biologically, based, whereas, character, traits, were, thought, to, be, learned, either, during, childhood, or, throughout, life, with, the, advent, of, the, ffm, five, factor, model, behavior, geneticists, began, systematic, studies, of, the, full, range, of, personality, traits, and, it, soon, became, clear, that, all, five, factors, are, substantially, heritable, identical, twins, showed, very, similar, personality, traits, even, when, they, had, been, separated, at, birth, and, raised, apart, and, this, was, true, for, both, character, traits, and, temperament, traits, parents, and, communities, influence, the, ways, in, which, conscientiousness, is, expressed, but, they, apparently, do, not, influence, its, level, a, person, s, level, of, conscientiousness, is, generally, assessed, using, self, report, measures, although, peer, reports, and, third, party, observation, can, also, be, used, self, report, measures, are, either, lexical, or, based, on, statements, deciding, which, measure, of, either, type, to, use, in, research, is, determined, by, an, assessment, of, psychometric, properties, and, the, time, and, space, constraints, of, the, study, being, undertaken, lexical, measures, use, adjectives, that, reflect, conscientiousness, traits, such, as, efficient, and, systematic, and, are, very, space, and, time, efficient, for, research, purposes, goldberg, developed, a, 20, word, measure, as, part, of, his, 100, word, big, five, markers, saucier, developed, a, briefer, 8, word, measure, as, part, of, his, 40, word, mini, markers, thompson, revised, these, measures, to, develop, the, international, english, mini, markers, which, has, superior, validity, and, reliability, in, populations, both, within, and, outside, north, america, internal, consistency, reliability, of, the, international, english, mini, markers, for, the, conscientiousness, measure, for, native, english, speakers, is, reported, as, 90, that, for, non, native, english, speakers, is, 86, statement, measures, tend, to, comprise, more, words, than, lexical, measures, so, consume, more, research, instrument, space, and, more, respondent, time, to, complete, respondents, are, asked, the, extent, to, which, they, for, example, often, forget, to, put, things, back, in, their, proper, place, or, are, careful, to, avoid, making, mistakes, some, statement, based, measures, of, conscientiousness, have, similarly, acceptable, psychometric, properties, in, north, american, populations, to, lexical, measures, but, their, generally, emic, development, makes, them, less, suited, to, use, in, other, populations, for, instance, statements, in, colloquial, north, american, english, like, often, forget, to, put, things, back, in, their, proper, place, or, am, careful, to, avoid, making, mistakes, can, be, hard, for, non, native, english, speakers, to, understand, suggesting, internationally, validated, measures, might, be, more, appropriate, for, research, conducted, with, non, north, americans, currently, little, is, known, about, conscientiousness, in, young, children, because, the, self, report, inventories, typically, used, to, assess, it, are, not, appropriate, for, that, age, group, there, are, likely, individual, differences, in, this, factor, at, an, early, age, it, is, known, for, example, that, some, children, have, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, which, is, characterized, in, part, by, problems, with, concentration, organization, and, persistence, longitudinal, and, cross, sectional, studies, suggest, that, conscientiousness, is, relatively, low, among, adolescents, but, increases, between, 18, and, 30, years, of, age, conscientiousness, generally, increases, with, age, from, 21, to, 60, though, the, rate, of, increase, is, slow, individual, differences, are, strongly, preserved, meaning, that, a, careful, neat, and, scrupulous, 30, year, old, is, likely, to, become, a, careful, neat, and, scrupulous, 80, year, old, people, who, score, high, on, the, trait, of, conscientiousness, tend, to, be, more, organized, and, less, cluttered, in, their, homes, and, offices, for, example, their, books, tend, to, be, neatly, shelved, in, alphabetical, order, or, categorized, by, topic, rather, than, scattered, around, the, room, their, clothes, tend, to, be, folded, and, arranged, in, drawers, or, closets, instead, of, lying, on, the, floor, the, presence, of, planners, and, to, do, lists, are, also, signs, of, conscientiousness, their, homes, tend, to, have, better, lighting, than, the, homes, of, people, who, score, low, on, this, trait, conscientiousness, correlates, with, successful, academic, performance, in, students, and, workplace, performance, among, managers, and, workers, low, levels, of, conscientiousness, are, strongly, associated, with, procrastination, conscientiousness, has, a, moderate, to, large, positive, correlation, with, performance, in, the, workplace, and, in, contrast, after, general, mental, ability, is, taken, into, account, the, other, four, big, five, personality, traits, do, not, aid, in, predicting, career, success, 169, conscientious, employees, are, generally, more, reliable, more, motivated, and, harder, working, they, have, lower, rates, of, absenteeism, and, counterproductive, work, behaviors, such, as, stealing, and, fighting, with, other, employees, furthermore, conscientiousness, is, the, personality, trait, that, correlates, the, most, with, performance, across, all, categories, of, jobs, agreeableness, and, emotional, stability, may, also, be, important, particularly, in, jobs, that, involve, a, significant, amount, of, social, interaction, of, all, manager, leader, types, top, executives, show, the, lowest, level, of, rule, following, a, conscientious, trait, conscientiousness, is, not, always, positively, related, to, job, performance, sometimes, the, opposite, is, true, being, too, conscientious, could, lead, to, taking, too, much, time, in, making, urgent, decisions, and, to, being, too, attached, to, the, rules, and, lacking, innovation, a, 2008, meta, analysis, found, that, conscientiousness, has, a, positive, relationship, with, subjective, well, being, particularly, satisfaction, with, life, highly, conscientious, people, tend, to, be, happier, with, their, lives, than, those, who, score, low, on, this, trait, although, conscientiousness, is, generally, seen, as, a, positive, trait, to, possess, research, suggests, that, in, some, situations, it, may, be, harmful, for, well, being, in, a, prospective, study, of, 9, 570, people, over, four, years, highly, conscientious, people, suffered, more, than, twice, as, much, if, they, became, unemployed, the, authors, suggested, this, may, be, due, to, conscientious, people, making, different, attributions, about, why, they, became, unemployed, or, through, experiencing, stronger, reactions, following, failure, this, finding, is, consistent, with, perspectives, which, see, no, trait, as, inherently, positive, or, negative, but, rather, the, consequences, of, the, trait, being, dependent, on, the, situation, and, concomitant, goals, and, motivations, low, conscientiousness, is, linked, to, anti, social, behavior, blue, collared, crimes, and, crimes, of, passion, as, well, as, unemployment, and, homelessness, low, conscientiousness, and, low, agreeableness, taken, together, are, also, associated, with, substance, use, disorders, people, low, in, conscientiousness, have, difficulty, saving, money, and, their, risky, borrowing, practices, make, them, fall, prey, to, subprime, and, predatory, lending, more, often, than, conscientious, people, high, conscientiousness, is, associated, with, more, careful, planning, of, shopping, trips, and, less, impulse, buying, of, unneeded, items, while, conscientiousness, is, generally, linked, to, a, lower, level, of, anti, social, behaviour, it, is, not, always, the, case, and, conscientiousness, is, not, always, negatively, correlated, with, criminality, it, has, been, shown, that, conscientiousness, is, positively, correlated, with, business, white, collared, and, premeditated, criminal, behavior, according, to, a, multi, decade, study, begun, in, 1921, by, psychologist, lewis, terman, on, over, 1, 500, gifted, adolescent, californians, the, strongest, predictor, of, long, life, was, conscientiousness, specific, behaviors, associated, with, low, conscientiousness, may, explain, its, influence, on, longevity, nine, different, behaviors, that, are, among, the, leading, causes, of, mortality, alcohol, use, disordered, eating, including, obesity, drug, use, lack, of, exercise, risky, sexual, behavior, risky, driving, tobacco, use, violence, and, suicide, are, all, predicted, by, low, conscientiousness, health, behaviors, are, more, strongly, correlated, with, the, conventionality, rather, than, the, impulse, control, aspect, of, conscientiousness, apparently, social, norms, influence, many, health, relevant, behaviors, such, as, healthy, diet, exercise, not, smoking, and, moderate, drinking, and, highly, conscientious, people, adhere, the, most, strongly, to, these, norms, conscientiousness, is, positively, related, to, health, behaviors, such, as, regular, visits, to, a, doctor, checking, smoke, alarms, and, adherence, to, medication, regimens, such, behavior, may, better, safeguard, health, and, prevent, disease, the, only, known, health, benefits, of, low, conscientiousness, are, relaxation, and, reduced, anxiety, relationship, quality, is, positively, associated, with, partners, levels, of, conscientiousness, highly, conscientious, people, are, less, likely, to, get, divorced, due, to, their, own, fault, conscientiousness, is, associated, with, lower, rates, of, behavior, associated, with, at, fault, divorce, such, as, extramarital, affairs, spousal, abuse, and, alcohol, use, disorder, conscientious, behaviors, may, have, a, direct, influence, on, relationship, quality, as, people, low, in, conscientiousness, are, less, responsible, less, responsive, to, their, partners, more, condescending, and, less, likely, to, hold, back, offensive, comments, more, conscientious, people, are, better, at, managing, conflict, and, tend, to, provoke, fewer, disagreements, perhaps, because, they, elicit, less, criticism, due, to, their, well, controlled, and, responsible, behavior, conscientiousness, has, distinct, sub, components, including, two, major, branches, i, e, orderliness, and, industriousness, the, largest, set, of, meta, analyses, found, that, these, branches, of, conscientiousness, have, disparate, connections, with, cognitive, abilities, orderliness, has, negative, correlations, with, some, cognitive, abilities, e, g, fluid, reasoning, abilities, math, knowledge, lexical, knowledge, and, science, knowledge, whereas, industriousness, has, strikingly, positive, correlations, with, multiple, abilities, e, g, general, mental, ability, memory, processing, speed, and, knowledge, some, previous, studies, in, selected, samples, e, g, job, candidates, university, students, have, found, negative, correlations, between, conscientiousness, and, intelligence, one, potential, explanation, is, that, these, negative, correlations, may, be, artificially, created, by, the, selection, of, the, sample, for, example, with, students, who, are, low, on, one, trait, and, high, on, the, other, negative, relationship, using, the, strong, one, to, compensate, and, pass, the, selection, while, students, who, are, low, on, both, positive, relationship, are, removed, by, the, selection, conscientiousness, correlates, with, conservative, political, attitudes, because, conscientiousness, is, positively, related, to, job, performance, conservative, service, workers, have, been, shown, to, earn, higher, ratings, evaluations, and, tips, than, their, liberal, counterparts, although, right, wing, authoritarianism, is, one, of, the, most, powerful, predictors, of, prejudice, a, large, scale, meta, analysis, found, that, conscientiousness, itself, is, uncorrelated, with, general, prejudice, rebellion, against, control, is, significantly, negatively, correlated, with, conscientiousness, hence, conscientiousness, is, associated, only, with, rule, compliance, obedience, and, integrity, not, necessarily, with, right, wing, authoritarianism, which, requires, reduced, big, five, agreeableness, as, well, the, orderliness, dependability, subfactors, order, dutifulness, and, deliberation, of, conscientiousness, correlate, negatively, with, creativity, while, the, industriousness, achievement, subfactors, competence, achievement, striving, and, self, discipline, correlate, positively, people, who, score, high, on, the, order, subfactor, of, conscientiousness, show, less, innovative, behavior, especially, if, coupled, with, a, low, score, on, the, industrious, subfactor, group, conscientiousness, has, a, negative, effect, on, group, performance, during, creative, tasks, groups, with, only, conscientious, members, have, difficulty, solving, open, ended, problems, a, study, from, 2006, found, that, those, scoring, low, on, conscientiousness, make, better, decisions, after, unanticipated, changes, in, the, context, of, a, task, specifically, the, subfactors, order, dutifulness, and, deliberation, negatively, correlated, with, decision, making, quality, but, not, competence, achievement, striving, and, self, discipline, general, religiosity, was, mainly, correlated, with, high, agreeableness, and, conscientiousness, among, the, big, five, traits, conscientiousness, in, psychology, is, defined, as, noted, above, by, notions, such, as, orderliness, and, industriousness, not, by, reference, to, the, ordinary, language, notion, of, conscience, or, such, as, is, referred, to, in, the, legal, doctrine, of, equity, by, concern, with, preventing, unconscionable, actions, average, levels, of, conscientiousness, vary, by, state, in, the, united, states, people, living, in, the, central, part, including, the, states, of, kansas, nebraska, oklahoma, and, missouri, on, average, have, higher, scores, than, people, living, in, other, regions, people, in, the, southwestern, states, of, new, mexico, utah, and, arizona, also, have, relatively, high, average, scores, on, conscientiousness, among, the, eastern, states, florida, is, the, only, one, that, scores, in, the, top, ten, for, this, personality, trait, the, four, states, with, the, lowest, scores, on, conscientiousness, on, average, were, in, descending, order, rhode, island, hawaii, maine, and, alaska, a, large, scale, survey, of, residents, of, great, britain, found, that, average, levels, of, all, the, big, five, including, conscientiousness, vary, across, regional, districts, in, england, wales, and, scotland, high, levels, of, conscientiousness, were, found, throughout, much, of, southern, england, scattered, areas, of, the, midlands, and, most, of, the, scottish, highlands, low, levels, of, conscientiousness, were, observed, in, london, wales, and, parts, of, the, north, of, england, higher, mean, levels, of, regional, conscientiousness, were, positively, correlated, with, voting, for, toryism, and, the, conservative, party, and, negatively, correlated, with, voting, for, the, labour, party, in, the, 2005, and, 2010, elections, and, also, correlated, with, a, higher, proportion, of, married, residents, with, higher, life, expectancy, for, men, and, women, fewer, long, term, health, problems, and, with, lower, rates, of, mortality, from, stroke, cancer, and, heart, disease, higher, regional, conscientiousness, was, also, correlated, with, lower, median, annual, income, in, 2011
