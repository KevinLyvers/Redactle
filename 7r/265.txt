the, international, monetary, fund, imf, is, a, major, financial, agency, of, the, united, nations, and, an, international, financial, institution, funded, by, 190, member, countries, with, headquarters, in, washington, d, c, it, is, regarded, as, the, global, lender, of, last, resort, to, national, governments, and, a, leading, supporter, of, exchange, rate, stability, its, stated, mission, is, working, to, foster, global, monetary, cooperation, secure, financial, stability, facilitate, international, trade, promote, high, employment, and, sustainable, economic, growth, and, reduce, poverty, around, the, world, established, on, 27, december, 1945, at, the, bretton, woods, conference, primarily, according, to, the, ideas, of, harry, dexter, white, and, john, maynard, keynes, it, started, with, 29, member, countries, and, the, goal, of, reconstructing, the, international, monetary, system, after, world, war, ii, it, now, plays, a, central, role, in, the, management, of, balance, of, payments, difficulties, and, international, financial, crises, through, a, quota, system, countries, contribute, funds, to, a, pool, from, which, countries, can, borrow, if, they, experience, balance, of, payments, problems, the, imf, works, to, stabilize, and, foster, the, economies, of, its, member, countries, by, its, use, of, the, fund, as, well, as, other, activities, such, as, gathering, and, analyzing, economic, statistics, and, surveillance, of, its, members, economies, the, current, managing, director, md, and, chairperson, of, the, imf, is, bulgarian, economist, kristalina, georgieva, who, has, held, the, post, since, 1, october, 2019, indian, american, economist, gita, gopinath, previously, the, chief, economist, was, appointed, as, first, deputy, managing, director, effective, 21, january, 2022, pierre, olivier, gourinchas, was, appointed, chief, economist, on, 24, january, 2022, according, to, the, imf, itself, it, works, to, foster, global, growth, and, economic, stability, by, providing, policy, advice, and, financing, to, its, members, it, also, works, with, developing, countries, to, help, them, achieve, macroeconomic, stability, and, reduce, poverty, the, rationale, for, this, is, that, private, international, capital, markets, function, imperfectly, and, many, countries, have, limited, access, to, financial, markets, such, market, imperfections, together, with, balance, of, payments, financing, provide, the, justification, for, official, financing, without, which, many, countries, could, only, correct, large, external, payment, imbalances, through, measures, with, adverse, economic, consequences, the, imf, provides, alternate, sources, of, financing, such, as, the, poverty, reduction, and, growth, facility, upon, the, founding, of, the, imf, its, three, primary, functions, were, the, imf, s, role, was, fundamentally, altered, by, the, floating, exchange, rates, after, 1971, it, shifted, to, examining, the, economic, policies, of, countries, with, imf, loan, agreements, to, determine, whether, a, shortage, of, capital, was, due, to, economic, fluctuations, or, economic, policy, the, imf, also, researched, what, types, of, government, policy, would, ensure, economic, recovery, a, particular, concern, of, the, imf, was, to, prevent, financial, crises, such, as, those, in, mexico, in, 1982, brazil, in, 1987, east, asia, in, 1997, 98, and, russia, in, 1998, from, spreading, and, threatening, the, entire, global, financial, and, currency, system, the, challenge, was, to, promote, and, implement, a, policy, that, reduced, the, frequency, of, crises, among, emerging, market, countries, especially, the, middle, income, countries, which, are, vulnerable, to, massive, capital, outflows, rather, than, maintaining, a, position, of, oversight, of, only, exchange, rates, their, function, became, one, of, surveillance, of, the, overall, macroeconomic, performance, of, member, countries, their, role, became, a, lot, more, active, because, the, imf, now, manages, economic, policy, rather, than, just, exchange, rates, in, addition, the, imf, negotiates, conditions, on, lending, and, loans, under, their, policy, of, conditionality, which, was, established, in, the, 1950s, low, income, countries, can, borrow, on, concessional, terms, which, means, there, is, a, period, of, time, with, no, interest, rates, through, the, extended, credit, facility, ecf, the, standby, credit, facility, scf, and, the, rapid, credit, facility, rcf, non, concessional, loans, which, include, interest, rates, are, provided, mainly, through, the, stand, by, arrangements, sba, the, flexible, credit, line, fcl, the, precautionary, and, liquidity, line, pll, and, the, extended, fund, facility, the, imf, provides, emergency, assistance, via, the, rapid, financing, instrument, rfi, to, members, facing, urgent, balance, of, payments, needs, the, imf, is, mandated, to, oversee, the, international, monetary, and, financial, system, and, monitor, the, economic, and, financial, policies, of, its, member, countries, this, activity, is, known, as, surveillance, and, facilitates, international, co, operation, since, the, demise, of, the, bretton, woods, system, of, fixed, exchange, rates, in, the, early, 1970s, surveillance, has, evolved, largely, by, way, of, changes, in, procedures, rather, than, through, the, adoption, of, new, obligations, the, responsibilities, changed, from, those, of, guardians, to, those, of, overseers, of, members, policies, the, fund, typically, analyses, the, appropriateness, of, each, member, country, s, economic, and, financial, policies, for, achieving, orderly, economic, growth, and, assesses, the, consequences, of, these, policies, for, other, countries, and, for, the, global, economy, for, instance, the, imf, played, a, significant, role, in, individual, countries, such, as, armenia, and, belarus, in, providing, financial, support, to, achieve, stabilization, financing, from, 2009, to, 2019, the, maximum, sustainable, debt, level, of, a, polity, which, is, watched, closely, by, the, imf, was, defined, in, 2011, by, imf, economists, to, be, 120, indeed, it, was, at, this, number, that, the, greek, economy, melted, down, in, 2010, in, 1995, the, international, monetary, fund, began, to, work, on, data, dissemination, standards, with, the, view, of, guiding, imf, member, countries, to, disseminate, their, economic, and, financial, data, to, the, public, the, international, monetary, and, financial, committee, imfc, endorsed, the, guidelines, for, the, dissemination, standards, and, they, were, split, into, two, tiers, the, general, data, dissemination, system, gdds, and, the, special, data, dissemination, standard, sdds, the, executive, board, approved, the, sdds, and, gdds, in, 1996, and, 1997, respectively, and, subsequent, amendments, were, published, in, a, revised, guide, to, the, general, data, dissemination, system, the, system, is, aimed, primarily, at, statisticians, and, aims, to, improve, many, aspects, of, statistical, systems, in, a, country, it, is, also, part, of, the, world, bank, millennium, development, goals, mdg, and, poverty, reduction, strategic, papers, prsps, the, primary, objective, of, the, gdds, is, to, encourage, member, countries, to, build, a, framework, to, improve, data, quality, and, statistical, capacity, building, to, evaluate, statistical, needs, set, priorities, in, improving, timeliness, transparency, reliability, and, accessibility, of, financial, and, economic, data, some, countries, initially, used, the, gdds, but, later, upgraded, to, sdds, some, entities, that, are, not, imf, members, also, contribute, statistical, data, to, the, systems, a, 2021, study, found, that, the, imf, s, surveillance, activities, have, a, substantial, impact, on, sovereign, debt, with, much, greater, impacts, in, emerging, than, high, income, economies, imf, conditionality, is, a, set, of, policies, or, conditions, that, the, imf, requires, in, exchange, for, financial, resources, the, imf, does, require, collateral, from, countries, for, loans, but, also, requires, the, government, seeking, assistance, to, correct, its, macroeconomic, imbalances, in, the, form, of, policy, reform, if, the, conditions, are, not, met, the, funds, are, withheld, the, concept, of, conditionality, was, introduced, in, a, 1952, executive, board, decision, and, later, incorporated, into, the, articles, of, agreement, conditionality, is, associated, with, economic, theory, as, well, as, an, enforcement, mechanism, for, repayment, stemming, primarily, from, the, work, of, jacques, polak, the, theoretical, underpinning, of, conditionality, was, the, monetary, approach, to, the, balance, of, payments, some, of, the, conditions, for, structural, adjustment, can, include, these, conditions, are, known, as, the, washington, consensus, these, loan, conditions, ensure, that, the, borrowing, country, will, be, able, to, repay, the, imf, and, that, the, country, will, not, attempt, to, solve, their, balance, of, payment, problems, in, a, way, that, would, negatively, impact, the, international, economy, the, incentive, problem, of, moral, hazard, when, economic, agents, maximise, their, own, utility, to, the, detriment, of, others, because, they, do, not, bear, the, full, consequences, of, their, actions, is, mitigated, through, conditions, rather, than, providing, collateral, countries, in, need, of, imf, loans, do, not, generally, possess, internationally, valuable, collateral, anyway, conditionality, also, reassures, the, imf, that, the, funds, lent, to, them, will, be, used, for, the, purposes, defined, by, the, articles, of, agreement, and, provides, safeguards, that, the, country, will, be, able, to, rectify, its, macroeconomic, and, structural, imbalances, in, the, judgment, of, the, imf, the, adoption, by, the, member, of, certain, corrective, measures, or, policies, will, allow, it, to, repay, the, imf, thereby, ensuring, that, the, resources, will, be, available, to, support, other, members, as, of, 2004, borrowing, countries, have, had, a, good, track, record, for, repaying, credit, extended, under, the, imf, s, regular, lending, facilities, with, full, interest, over, the, duration, of, the, loan, this, indicates, that, imf, lending, does, not, impose, a, burden, on, creditor, countries, as, lending, countries, receive, market, rate, interest, on, most, of, their, quota, subscription, plus, any, of, their, own, currency, subscriptions, that, are, loaned, out, by, the, imf, plus, all, of, the, reserve, assets, that, they, provide, the, imf, the, imf, was, originally, laid, out, as, a, part, of, the, bretton, woods, system, exchange, agreement, in, 1944, during, the, great, depression, countries, sharply, raised, barriers, to, trade, in, an, attempt, to, improve, their, failing, economies, this, led, to, the, devaluation, of, national, currencies, and, a, decline, in, world, trade, this, breakdown, in, international, monetary, cooperation, created, a, need, for, oversight, the, representatives, of, 45, governments, met, at, the, bretton, woods, conference, in, the, mount, washington, hotel, in, bretton, woods, new, hampshire, in, the, united, states, to, discuss, a, framework, for, postwar, international, economic, cooperation, and, how, to, rebuild, europe, there, were, two, views, on, the, role, the, imf, should, assume, as, a, global, economic, institution, american, delegate, harry, dexter, white, foresaw, an, imf, that, functioned, more, like, a, bank, making, sure, that, borrowing, states, could, repay, their, debts, on, time, most, of, white, s, plan, was, incorporated, into, the, final, acts, adopted, at, bretton, woods, british, economist, john, maynard, keynes, on, the, other, hand, imagined, that, the, imf, would, be, a, cooperative, fund, upon, which, member, states, could, draw, to, maintain, economic, activity, and, employment, through, periodic, crises, this, view, suggested, an, imf, that, helped, governments, and, act, as, the, united, states, government, had, during, the, new, deal, to, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, the, imf, formally, came, into, existence, on, 27, december, 1945, when, the, first, 29, countries, ratified, its, articles, of, agreement, by, the, end, of, 1946, the, imf, had, grown, to, 39, members, on, 1, march, 1947, the, imf, began, its, financial, operations, and, on, 8, may, france, became, the, first, country, to, borrow, from, it, the, imf, was, one, of, the, key, organizations, of, the, international, economic, system, its, design, allowed, the, system, to, balance, the, rebuilding, of, international, capitalism, with, the, maximization, of, national, economic, sovereignty, and, human, welfare, also, known, as, embedded, liberalism, the, imf, s, influence, in, the, global, economy, steadily, increased, as, it, accumulated, more, members, its, membership, began, to, expand, in, the, late, 1950s, and, during, the, 1960s, as, many, african, countries, became, independent, and, applied, for, membership, but, the, cold, war, limited, the, fund, s, membership, with, most, countries, in, the, soviet, sphere, of, influence, not, joining, until, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, bretton, woods, exchange, rate, system, prevailed, until, 1971, when, the, united, states, government, suspended, the, convertibility, of, the, us, and, dollar, reserves, held, by, other, governments, into, gold, this, is, known, as, the, nixon, shock, the, changes, to, the, imf, articles, of, agreement, reflecting, these, changes, were, ratified, in, 1976, by, the, jamaica, accords, later, in, the, 1970s, large, commercial, banks, began, lending, to, states, because, they, were, awash, in, cash, deposited, by, oil, exporters, the, lending, of, the, so, called, money, center, banks, led, to, the, imf, changing, its, role, in, the, 1980s, after, a, world, recession, provoked, a, crisis, that, brought, the, imf, back, into, global, financial, governance, in, the, mid, 1980s, the, imf, shifted, its, narrow, focus, from, currency, stabilization, to, a, broader, focus, of, promoting, market, liberalizing, reforms, through, structural, adjustment, programs, this, shift, occurred, without, a, formal, renegotiation, of, the, organization, s, charter, or, operational, guidelines, the, ronald, reagan, administration, in, particular, treasury, secretary, james, baker, his, assistant, secretary, david, mulford, and, deputy, assistant, secretary, charles, dallara, pressured, the, imf, to, attach, market, liberal, reforms, to, the, organization, s, conditional, loans, during, the, 20th, century, the, imf, shifted, its, position, on, capital, controls, whereas, the, imf, permitted, capital, controls, at, its, founding, and, throughout, the, 1970s, imf, staff, increasingly, favored, free, capital, movement, from, 1980s, onwards, this, shift, happened, in, the, aftermath, of, an, emerging, consensus, in, economics, on, the, desirability, of, free, capital, movement, retirement, of, imf, staff, hired, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, and, the, recruitment, of, staff, exposed, to, new, thinking, in, economics, the, imf, provided, two, major, lending, packages, in, the, early, 2000s, to, argentina, during, the, 1998, 2002, argentine, great, depression, and, uruguay, after, the, 2002, uruguay, banking, crisis, however, by, the, mid, 2000s, imf, lending, was, at, its, lowest, share, of, world, gdp, since, the, 1970s, in, may, 2010, the, imf, participated, in, 3, 11, proportion, in, the, first, greek, bailout, that, totaled, 110, billion, to, address, the, great, accumulation, of, public, debt, caused, by, continuing, large, public, sector, deficits, as, part, of, the, bailout, the, greek, government, agreed, to, adopt, austerity, measures, that, would, reduce, the, deficit, from, 11, in, 2009, to, well, below, 3, in, 2014, the, bailout, did, not, include, debt, restructuring, measures, such, as, a, haircut, to, the, chagrin, of, the, swiss, brazilian, indian, russian, and, argentinian, directors, of, the, imf, with, the, greek, authorities, themselves, at, the, time, pm, george, papandreou, and, finance, minister, giorgos, papakonstantinou, ruling, out, a, haircut, a, second, bailout, package, of, more, than, 100, billion, was, agreed, upon, over, the, course, of, a, few, months, from, october, 2011, during, which, time, papandreou, was, forced, from, office, the, so, called, troika, of, which, the, imf, is, part, are, joint, managers, of, this, programme, which, was, approved, by, the, executive, directors, of, the, imf, on, 15, march, 2012, for, xdr, 23, 8, billion, and, saw, private, bondholders, take, a, haircut, of, upwards, of, 50, in, the, interval, between, may, 2010, and, february, 2012, the, private, banks, of, holland, france, and, germany, reduced, exposure, to, greek, debt, from, 122, billion, to, 66, billion, as, of, january, 2012, the, largest, borrowers, from, the, imf, in, order, were, greece, portugal, ireland, romania, and, ukraine, on, 25, march, 2013, a, 10, billion, international, bailout, of, cyprus, was, agreed, by, the, troika, at, the, cost, to, the,

100k, or, less, were, to, be, affected, under, the, terms, of, a, novel, bail, in, scheme, the, topic, of, sovereign, debt, restructuring, was, taken, up, by, the, imf, in, april, 2013, for, the, first, time, since, 2005, in, a, report, entitled, sovereign, debt, restructuring, recent, developments, and, implications, for, the, fund, s, legal, and, policy, framework, the, paper, which, was, discussed, by, the, board, on, 20, may, summarised, the, recent, experiences, in, greece, st, kitts, and, nevis, belize, and, jamaica, an, explanatory, interview, with, deputy, director, hugh, bredenkamp, was, published, a, few, days, later, as, was, a, deconstruction, by, matina, stevis, of, the, wall, street, journal, in, the, october, 2013, fiscal, monitor, publication, the, imf, suggested, that, a, capital, levy, capable, of, reducing, euro, area, government, debt, ratios, to, end, 2007, levels, would, require, a, very, high, tax, rate, of, about, 10, the, fiscal, affairs, department, of, the, imf, headed, at, the, time, by, acting, director, sanjeev, gupta, produced, a, january, 2014, report, entitled, fiscal, policy, and, income, inequality, that, stated, that, some, taxes, levied, on, wealth, especially, on, immovable, property, are, also, an, option, for, economies, seeking, more, progressive, taxation, property, taxes, are, equitable, and, efficient, but, underutilized, in, many, economies, there, is, considerable, scope, to, exploit, this, tax, more, fully, both, as, a, revenue, source, and, as, a, redistributive, instrument, at, the, end, of, march, 2014, the, imf, secured, an, 18, billion, bailout, fund, for, the, provisional, government, of, ukraine, in, the, aftermath, of, the, revolution, of, dignity, in, late, 2019, the, imf, estimated,

undermined, the, legitimacy, of, the, imf, and, called, for, the, appointment, to, be, merit, based, former, managing, director, dominique, strauss, kahn, was, arrested, in, connection, with, charges, of, sexually, assaulting, a, new, york, hotel, room, attendant, and, resigned, on, 18, may, the, charges, were, later, dropped, on, 28, june, 2011, christine, lagarde, was, confirmed, as, managing, director, of, the, imf, for, a, five, year, term, starting, on, 5, july, 2011, she, was, re, elected, by, consensus, for, a, second, five, year, term, starting, 5, july, 2016, being, the, only, candidate, nominated, for, the, post, of, managing, director, the, managing, director, is, assisted, by, a, first, deputy, managing, director, fdmd, who, by, convention, has, always, been, a, citizen, of, the, united, states, together, the, managing, director, and, their, first, deputy, lead, the, senior, management, of, the, imf, like, the, managing, director, the, first, deputy, traditionally, serves, a, five, year, term, the, chief, economist, leads, the, research, division, of, the, imf, and, is, a, senior, official, of, the, imf, imf, staff, have, considerable, autonomy, and, are, known, to, shape, imf, policy, according, to, jeffrey, chwieroth, it, is, the, staff, members, who, conduct, the, bulk, of, the, imf, s, tasks, they, formulate, policy, proposals, for, consideration, by, member, states, exercise, surveillance, carry, out, loan, negotiations, and, design, the, programs, and, collect, and, systematize, detailed, information, most, imf, staff, are, economists, according, to, a, 1968, study, nearly, 60, of, staff, were, from, english, speaking, developed, countries, by, 2004, between, 40, and, 50, of, staff, were, from, english, speaking, developed, countries, a, 1996, study, found, that, 90, of, new, staff, with, a, phd, obtained, them, from, universities, in, the, united, states, or, canada, a, 1999, study, found, that, none, of, the, new, staff, with, a, phd, obtained, their, phd, in, the, global, south, voting, power, in, the, imf, is, based, on, a, quota, system, each, member, has, a, number, of, basic, votes, equal, to, 5, 502, of, the, total, votes, plus, one, additional, vote, for, each, special, drawing, right, sdr, of, 100, 000, of, a, member, country, s, quota, the, sdr, is, the, unit, of, account, of, the, imf, and, represents, a, potential, claim, to, currency, it, is, based, on, a, basket, of, key, international, currencies, the, basic, votes, generate, a, slight, bias, in, favour, of, small, countries, but, the, additional, votes, determined, by, sdr, outweigh, this, bias, changes, in, the, voting, shares, require, approval, by, a, super, majority, of, 85, of, voting, power, in, december, 2015, the, united, states, congress, adopted, a, legislation, authorising, the, 2010, quota, and, governance, reforms, as, a, result, the, imf, s, quota, system, was, created, to, raise, funds, for, loans, each, imf, member, country, is, assigned, a, quota, or, contribution, that, reflects, the, country, s, relative, size, in, the, global, economy, each, member, s, quota, also, determines, its, relative, voting, power, thus, financial, contributions, from, member, governments, are, linked, to, voting, power, in, the, organization, this, system, follows, the, logic, of, a, shareholder, controlled, organization, wealthy, countries, have, more, say, in, the, making, and, revision, of, rules, since, decision, making, at, the, imf, reflects, each, member, s, relative, economic, position, in, the, world, wealthier, countries, that, provide, more, money, to, the, imf, have, more, influence, than, poorer, members, that, contribute, less, nonetheless, the, imf, focuses, on, redistribution, quotas, are, normally, reviewed, every, five, years, and, can, be, increased, when, deemed, necessary, by, the, board, of, governors, imf, voting, shares, are, relatively, inflexible, countries, that, grow, economically, have, tended, to, become, under, represented, as, their, voting, power, lags, behind, currently, reforming, the, representation, of, developing, countries, within, the, imf, has, been, suggested, these, countries, economies, represent, a, large, portion, of, the, global, economic, system, but, this, is, not, reflected, in, the, imf, s, decision, making, process, through, the, nature, of, the, quota, system, joseph, stiglitz, argues, there, is, a, need, to, provide, more, effective, voice, and, representation, for, developing, countries, which, now, represent, a, much, larger, portion, of, world, economic, activity, since, 1944, when, the, imf, was, created, in, 2008, a, number, of, quota, reforms, were, passed, including, shifting, 6, of, quota, shares, to, dynamic, emerging, markets, and, developing, countries, the, imf, s, membership, is, divided, along, income, lines, certain, countries, provide, financial, resources, while, others, use, these, resources, both, developed, country, creditors, and, developing, country, borrowers, are, members, of, the, imf, the, developed, countries, provide, the, financial, resources, but, rarely, enter, into, imf, loan, agreements, they, are, the, creditors, conversely, the, developing, countries, use, the, lending, services, but, contribute, little, to, the, pool, of, money, available, to, lend, because, their, quotas, are, smaller, they, are, the, borrowers, thus, tension, is, created, around, governance, issues, because, these, two, groups, creditors, and, borrowers, have, fundamentally, different, interests, the, criticism, is, that, the, system, of, voting, power, distribution, through, a, quota, system, institutionalizes, borrower, subordination, and, creditor, dominance, the, resulting, division, of, the, imf, s, membership, into, borrowers, and, non, borrowers, has, increased, the, controversy, around, conditionality, because, the, borrowers, are, interested, in, increasing, loan, access, while, creditors, want, to, maintain, reassurance, that, the, loans, will, be, repaid, in, 2008, the, sais, review, of, international, affairs, revealed, that, the, average, overall, use, of, imf, credit, per, decade, increased, in, real, terms, by, 21, between, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, and, increased, again, by, just, over, 22, from, the, 1980s, to, the, 1991, 2005, period, another, study, has, suggested, that, since, 1950, the, continent, of, africa, alone, has, received, 300, billion, from, the, imf, the, world, bank, and, affiliate, institutions, a, study, by, bumba, mukherjee, found, that, developing, democratic, countries, benefit, more, from, imf, programs, than, developing, autocratic, countries, because, policy, making, and, the, process, of, deciding, where, loaned, money, is, used, is, more, transparent, within, a, democracy, one, study, done, by, randall, stone, found, that, although, earlier, studies, found, little, impact, of, imf, programs, on, balance, of, payments, more, recent, studies, using, more, sophisticated, methods, and, larger, samples, usually, found, imf, programs, improved, the, balance, of, payments, the, exceptional, access, framework, was, created, in, 2003, when, john, b, taylor, was, under, secretary, of, the, us, treasury, for, international, affairs, the, new, framework, became, fully, operational, in, february, 2003, and, it, was, applied, in, the, subsequent, decisions, on, argentina, and, brazil, its, purpose, was, to, place, some, sensible, rules, and, limits, on, the, way, the, imf, makes, loans, to, support, governments, with, debt, problem, especially, in, emerging, markets, and, thereby, move, away, from, the, bailout, mentality, of, the, 1990s, such, a, reform, was, essential, for, ending, the, crisis, atmosphere, that, then, existed, in, emerging, markets, the, reform, was, closely, related, to, and, put, in, place, nearly, simultaneously, with, the, actions, of, several, emerging, market, countries, to, place, collective, action, clauses, in, their, bond, contracts, in, 2010, the, framework, was, abandoned, so, the, imf, could, make, loans, to, greece, in, an, unsustainable, and, political, situation, the, topic, of, sovereign, debt, restructuring, was, taken, up, by, imf, staff, in, april, 2013, for, the, first, time, since, 2005, in, a, report, entitled, sovereign, debt, restructuring, recent, developments, and, implications, for, the, fund, s, legal, and, policy, framework, the, paper, which, was, discussed, by, the, board, on, 20, may, summarised, the, recent, experiences, in, greece, st, kitts, and, nevis, belize, and, jamaica, an, explanatory, interview, with, deputy, director, hugh, bredenkamp, was, published, a, few, days, later, as, was, a, deconstruction, by, matina, stevis, of, the, wall, street, journal, the, staff, was, directed, to, formulate, an, updated, policy, which, was, accomplished, on, 22, may, 2014, with, a, report, entitled, the, fund, s, lending, framework, and, sovereign, debt, preliminary, considerations, and, taken, up, by, the, executive, board, on, 13, june, the, staff, proposed, that, in, circumstances, where, a, sovereign, member, has, lost, market, access, and, debt, is, considered, sustainable, the, imf, would, be, able, to, provide, exceptional, access, on, the, basis, of, a, debt, operation, that, involves, an, extension, of, maturities, which, was, labeled, a, reprofiling, operation, these, reprofiling, operations, would, generally, be, less, costly, to, the, debtor, and, creditors, and, thus, to, the, system, overall, relative, to, either, an, upfront, debt, reduction, operation, or, a, bail, out, that, is, followed, by, debt, reduction, and, would, be, envisaged, only, when, both, a, a, member, has, lost, market, access, and, b, debt, is, assessed, to, be, sustainable, but, not, with, high, probability, creditors, will, only, agree, if, they, understand, that, such, an, amendment, is, necessary, to, avoid, a, worse, outcome, namely, a, default, and, or, an, operation, involving, debt, reduction, collective, action, clauses, which, now, exist, in, most, but, not, all, bonds, would, be, relied, upon, to, address, collective, action, problems, according, to, a, 2002, study, by, randall, w, stone, the, academic, literature, on, the, imf, shows, no, consensus, on, the, long, term, effects, of, imf, programs, on, growth, some, research, has, found, that, imf, loans, can, reduce, the, chance, of, a, future, banking, crisis, while, other, studies, have, found, that, they, can, increase, the, risk, of, political, crises, imf, programs, can, reduce, the, effects, of, a, currency, crisis, some, research, has, found, that, imf, programs, are, less, effective, in, countries, which, possess, a, developed, country, patron, be, it, by, foreign, aid, membership, of, postcolonial, institutions, or, un, voting, patterns, seemingly, due, to, this, patron, allowing, countries, to, flaunt, imf, program, rules, as, these, rules, are, not, consistently, enforced, some, research, has, found, that, imf, loans, reduce, economic, growth, due, to, creating, an, economic, moral, hazard, reducing, public, investment, reducing, incentives, to, create, a, robust, domestic, policies, and, reducing, private, investor, confidence, other, research, has, indicated, that, imf, loans, can, have, a, positive, impact, on, economic, growth, and, that, their, effects, are, highly, nuanced, overseas, development, institute, odi, research, undertaken, in, 1980, included, criticisms, of, the, imf, which, support, the, analysis, that, it, is, a, pillar, of, what, activist, titus, alexander, calls, global, apartheid, odi, conclusions, were, that, the, imf, s, very, nature, of, promoting, market, oriented, approaches, attracted, unavoidable, criticism, on, the, other, hand, the, imf, could, serve, as, a, scapegoat, while, allowing, governments, to, blame, international, bankers, the, odi, conceded, that, the, imf, was, insensitive, to, political, aspirations, of, ldcs, while, its, policy, conditions, were, inflexible, argentina, which, had, been, considered, by, the, imf, to, be, a, model, country, in, its, compliance, to, policy, proposals, by, the, bretton, woods, institutions, experienced, a, catastrophic, economic, crisis, in, 2001, which, some, believe, to, have, been, caused, by, imf, induced, budget, restrictions, which, undercut, the, government, s, ability, to, sustain, national, infrastructure, even, in, crucial, areas, such, as, health, education, and, security, and, privatisation, of, strategically, vital, national, resources, others, attribute, the, crisis, to, argentina, s, misdesigned, fiscal, federalism, which, caused, subnational, spending, to, increase, rapidly, the, crisis, added, to, widespread, hatred, of, this, institution, in, argentina, and, other, south, american, countries, with, many, blaming, the, imf, for, the, region, s, economic, problems, the, current, as, of, early, 2006, trend, toward, moderate, left, wing, governments, in, the, region, and, a, growing, concern, with, the, development, of, a, regional, economic, policy, largely, independent, of, big, business, pressures, has, been, ascribed, to, this, crisis, in, 2006, a, senior, actionaid, policy, analyst, akanksha, marphatia, stated, that, imf, policies, in, africa, undermine, any, possibility, of, meeting, the, millennium, development, goals, mdgs, due, to, imposed, restrictions, that, prevent, spending, on, important, sectors, such, as, education, and, health, in, an, interview, 2008, 05, 19, the, former, romanian, prime, minister, c, lin, popescu, t, riceanu, claimed, that, since, 2005, imf, is, constantly, making, mistakes, when, it, appreciates, the, country, s, economic, performances, former, tanzanian, president, julius, nyerere, who, claimed, that, debt, ridden, african, states, were, ceding, sovereignty, to, the, imf, and, the, world, bank, famously, asked, who, elected, the, imf, to, be, the, ministry, of, finance, for, every, country, in, the, world, former, chief, economist, of, imf, and, former, reserve, bank, of, india, rbi, governor, raghuram, rajan, who, predicted, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 08, criticised, the, imf, for, remaining, a, sideline, player, to, the, developed, world, he, criticised, the, imf, for, praising, the, monetary, policies, of, the, us, which, he, believed, were, wreaking, havoc, in, emerging, markets, he, had, been, critical, of, ultra, loose, money, policies, of, some, unnamed, countries, countries, such, as, zambia, have, not, received, proper, aid, with, long, lasting, effects, leading, to, concern, from, economists, since, 2005, zambia, as, well, as, 29, other, african, countries, did, receive, debt, write, offs, which, helped, with, the, country, s, medical, and, education, funds, however, zambia, returned, to, a, debt, of, over, half, its, gdp, in, less, than, a, decade, american, economist, william, easterly, sceptical, of, the, imf, s, methods, had, initially, warned, that, debt, relief, would, simply, encourage, more, reckless, borrowing, by, crooked, governments, unless, it, was, accompanied, by, reforms, to, speed, up, economic, growth, and, improve, governance, according, to, the, economist, the, imf, has, been, criticised, for, being, out, of, touch, with, local, economic, conditions, cultures, and, environments, in, the, countries, they, are, requiring, policy, reform, the, economic, advice, the, imf, gives, might, not, always, take, into, consideration, the, difference, between, what, spending, means, on, paper, and, how, it, is, felt, by, citizens, countries, charge, that, with, excessive, conditionality, they, do, not, own, the, programmes, and, the, links, are, broken, between, a, recipient, country, s, people, its, government, and, the, goals, being, pursued, by, the, imf, jeffrey, sachs, argues, that, the, imf, s, usual, prescription, is, budgetary, belt, tightening, to, countries, who, are, much, too, poor, to, own, belts, sachs, wrote, that, the, imf, s, role, as, a, generalist, institution, specialising, in, macroeconomic, issues, needs, reform, conditionality, has, also, been, criticised, because, a, country, can, pledge, collateral, of, acceptable, assets, to, obtain, waivers, if, one, assumes, that, all, countries, are, able, to, provide, acceptable, collateral, one, view, is, that, conditionality, undermines, domestic, political, institutions, the, recipient, governments, are, sacrificing, policy, autonomy, in, exchange, for, funds, which, can, lead, to, public, resentment, of, the, local, leadership, for, accepting, and, enforcing, the, imf, conditions, political, instability, can, result, from, more, leadership, turnover, as, political, leaders, are, replaced, in, electoral, backlashes, imf, conditions, are, often, criticised, for, reducing, government, services, thus, increasing, unemployment, another, criticism, is, that, imf, policies, are, only, designed, to, address, poor, governance, excessive, government, spending, excessive, government, intervention, in, markets, and, too, much, state, ownership, this, assumes, that, this, narrow, range, of, issues, represents, the, only, possible, problems, everything, is, standardised, and, differing, contexts, are, ignored, a, country, may, also, be, compelled, to, accept, conditions, it, would, not, normally, accept, had, they, not, been, in, a, financial, crisis, in, need, of, assistance, on, top, of, that, regardless, of, what, methodologies, and, data, sets, used, it, comes, to, same, the, conclusion, of, exacerbating, income, inequality, with, gini, coefficient, it, became, clear, that, countries, with, imf, policies, face, increased, income, inequality, it, is, claimed, that, conditionalities, hinder, social, stability, and, hence, inhibit, the, stated, goals, of, the, imf, while, structural, adjustment, programmes, lead, to, an, increase, in, poverty, in, recipient, countries, the, imf, sometimes, advocates, austerity, programmes, cutting, public, spending, and, increasing, taxes, even, when, the, economy, is, weak, to, bring, budgets, closer, to, a, balance, thus, reducing, budget, deficits, countries, are, often, advised, to, lower, their, corporate, tax, rate, in, globalization, and, its, discontents, joseph, e, stiglitz, former, chief, economist, and, senior, vice, president, at, the, world, bank, criticises, these, policies, he, argues, that, by, converting, to, a, more, monetarist, approach, the, purpose, of, the, fund, is, no, longer, valid, as, it, was, designed, to, provide, funds, for, countries, to, carry, out, keynesian, reflations, and, that, the, imf, was, not, participating, in, a, conspiracy, but, it, was, reflecting, the, interests, and, ideology, of, the, western, financial, community, stiglitz, concludes, modern, high, tech, warfare, is, designed, to, remove, physical, contact, dropping, bombs, from, 50, 000, feet, ensures, that, one, does, not, feel, what, one, does, modern, economic, management, is, similar, from, one, s, luxury, hotel, one, can, callously, impose, policies, about, which, one, would, think, twice, if, one, knew, the, people, whose, lives, one, was, destroying, the, researchers, eric, toussaint, and, damien, millet, argue, that, the, imf, s, policies, amount, to, a, new, form, of, colonisation, that, does, not, need, a, military, presence, following, the, exigencies, of, the, governments, of, the, richest, companies, the, imf, permitted, countries, in, crisis, to, borrow, in, order, to, avoid, default, on, their, repayments, caught, in, the, debt, s, downward, spiral, developing, countries, soon, had, no, other, recourse, than, to, take, on, new, debt, in, order, to, repay, the, old, debt, before, providing, them, with, new, loans, at, higher, interest, rates, future, leaders, asked, the, imf, to, intervene, with, the, guarantee, of, ulterior, reimbursement, asking, for, a, signed, agreement, with, the, said, countries, the, imf, thus, agreed, to, restart, the, flow, of, the, finance, pump, on, condition, that, the, concerned, countries, first, use, this, money, to, reimburse, banks, and, other, private, lenders, while, restructuring, their, economy, at, the, imf, s, discretion, these, were, the, famous, conditionalities, detailed, in, the, structural, adjustment, programmes, the, imf, and, its, ultra, liberal, experts, took, control, of, the, borrowing, countries, economic, policies, a, new, form, of, colonisation, was, thus, instituted, it, was, not, even, necessary, to, establish, an, administrative, or, military, presence, the, debt, alone, maintained, this, new, form, of, submission, international, politics, play, an, important, role, in, imf, decision, making, the, clout, of, member, states, is, roughly, proportional, to, its, contribution, to, imf, finances, the, united, states, has, the, greatest, number, of, votes, and, therefore, wields, the, most, influence, domestic, politics, often, come, into, play, with, politicians, in, developing, countries, using, conditionality, to, gain, leverage, over, the, opposition, to, influence, policy, academic, jeremy, garlick, cites, imf, loans, to, south, korea, during, the, 1997, asian, financial, crisis, as, widely, perceived, by, the, south, korean, public, as, a, debt, trap, 89, garlick, writes, that, the, public, was, generally, bitter, about, submitting, to, the, conditions, imposed, by, the, imf, which, required, south, korea, to, radically, restructure, its, economy, and, consult, with, the, imf, before, making, economic, decisions, until, the, debt, was, repaid, 89, in, 2016, the, imf, s, research, department, published, a, report, titled, neoliberalism, oversold, which, while, praising, some, aspects, of, the, neoliberal, agenda, claims, that, the, organisation, has, been, overselling, fiscal, austerity, policies, and, financial, deregulation, which, they, claim, has, exacerbated, both, financial, crises, and, economic, inequality, around, the, world, in, 2020, and, 2021, oxfam, criticized, the, imf, for, forcing, tough, austerity, measures, on, many, low, income, countries, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, despite, forcing, cuts, to, healthcare, spending, would, hamper, the, recipient, s, response, to, the, pandemic, the, role, of, the, bretton, woods, institutions, has, been, controversial, since, the, late, cold, war, because, of, claims, that, the, imf, policy, makers, supported, military, dictatorships, friendly, to, american, and, european, corporations, but, also, other, anti, communist, and, communist, regimes, such, as, socialist, republic, of, romania, an, example, of, imf, s, support, for, a, dictatorship, was, its, ongoing, support, for, mobutu, s, rule, in, zaire, although, its, own, envoy, erwin, blumenthal, provided, a, sobering, report, about, the, entrenched, corruption, and, embezzlement, and, the, inability, of, the, country, to, pay, back, any, loans, in, 2021, imf, approved, a, us, 1, billion, loan, to, the, autocratic, uganda, despite, protests, from, ugandans, in, washington, london, and, south, africa, critics, also, claim, that, the, imf, is, generally, apathetic, or, hostile, to, democracy, human, rights, and, labour, rights, the, controversy, has, helped, spark, the, anti, globalization, movement, arguments, in, favour, of, the, imf, supporting, dictatorships, is, the, claim, that, economic, stability, is, a, precursor, to, democracy, a, 2017, study, found, no, evidence, of, imf, lending, programs, undermining, democracy, in, borrowing, countries, it, found, evidence, for, modest, but, definitively, positive, conditional, differences, in, the, democracy, scores, of, participating, and, non, participating, countries, a, 2020, study, found, the, reverse, causality, with, democracy, as, a, precursor, to, economic, stability, critics, highlight, various, examples, in, which, democratised, countries, fell, after, receiving, imf, loans, party, based, autocracies, and, democracies, can, face, similar, incentives, when, considering, agreements, with, imf, in, contrast, to, personalist, and, military, regimes, a, number, of, civil, society, organisations, have, criticised, the, imf, s, policies, for, their, impact, on, access, to, food, particularly, in, developing, countries, in, october, 2008, former, united, states, president, bill, clinton, delivered, a, speech, to, the, united, nations, on, world, food, day, criticising, the, world, bank, and, imf, for, their, policies, on, food, and, agriculture, we, need, the, world, bank, the, imf, all, the, big, foundations, and, all, the, governments, to, admit, that, for, 30, years, we, all, blew, it, including, me, when, i, was, president, we, were, wrong, to, believe, that, food, was, like, some, other, product, in, international, trade, and, we, all, have, to, go, back, to, a, more, responsible, and, sustainable, form, of, agriculture, the, fpif, remarked, that, there, is, a, recurring, pattern, the, destabilization, of, peasant, producers, by, a, one, two, punch, of, imf, world, bank, structural, adjustment, programs, that, gutted, government, investment, in, the, countryside, followed, by, the, massive, influx, of, subsidized, u, s, and, european, union, agricultural, imports, after, the, wto, s, agreement, on, agriculture, pried, open, markets, a, 2009, study, concluded, that, the, strict, conditions, resulted, in, thousands, of, deaths, in, eastern, europe, by, tuberculosis, as, public, health, care, had, to, be, weakened, in, the, 21, countries, to, which, the, imf, had, given, loans, tuberculosis, deaths, rose, by, 16, 6, a, 2017, systematic, review, on, studies, conducted, on, the, impact, that, structural, adjustment, programs, have, on, child, and, maternal, health, found, that, these, programs, have, a, detrimental, effect, on, maternal, and, child, health, among, other, adverse, effects,
