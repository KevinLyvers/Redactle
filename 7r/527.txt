cause, battery, some, jurisdictions, combined, the, two, offenses, into, a, single, crime, called, assault, and, battery, which, then, became, widely, referred, to, as, assault, the, result, is, that, in, many, of, these, jurisdictions, assault, has, taken, on, a, definition, that, is, more, in, line, with, the, traditional, definition, of, battery, the, legal, systems, of, civil, law, and, scots,

stronger, form, of, assault, usually, using, a, deadly, weapon, a, person, has, committed, an, aggravated, assault, when, that, person, attempts, to, aggravated, assault, can, also, be, charged, in, cases, of, attempted, harm, against, police, officers, or, other, public, servants, although, the, range, and, precise, application, of, defenses, varies, between, jurisdictions, the, following, represents, a, list, of, the, defenses, that, may, apply, to, all, levels, of, assault, exceptions, exist, to, cover, unsolicited, physical, contact, which, amount, to, normal, social, behavior, known, as, de, minimis, harm, assault, can, also, be, considered, in, cases, involving, the, spitting, on, or, unwanted, exposure, of, bodily, fluids, to, others, consent, may, be, a, complete, or, partial, defense, to, assault, in, some, jurisdictions, most, notably, england, it, is, not, a, defense, where, the, degree, of, injury, is, severe, as, long, as, there, is, no, legally, recognized, good, reason, for, the, assault, this, can, have, important, consequences, when, dealing, with, issues, such, as, consensual, sadomasochistic, sexual, activity, the, most, notable, case, being, the,

but, it, could, be, preventing, a, crime, not, involving, the, use, of, personal, violence, some, jurisdictions, allow, force, to, be, used, in, defense, of, property, to, prevent, damage, either, in, its, own, right, or, under, one, or, both, of, the, preceding, classes, of, defense, in, that, a, threat, or, attempt, to, damage, property, might, be, considered, a, crime, in, english, law, under,

assault, occurs, when, a, person, directly, or, indirectly, applies, force, intentionally, to, another, person, without, their, consent, it, can, also, occur, when, a, person, attempts, to, apply, such, force, or, threatens, to, do, so, without, the, consent, of, the, other, person, an, injury, need, not, occur, for, an, assault, to, be, committed, but, the, force, used, in, the, assault, must, be, offensive, in, nature, with, an, intention, to, apply, force, it, can, be, an, assault, to, tap, pinch, push, or, direct, another, such, minor, action, toward, another, but, an, accidental, application, of, force, is, not, an, assault, the, potential, punishment, for, an, assault, in, canada, varies, depending, on, the, manner, in, which, the, charge, proceeds, through, the, court,

usage, the, term, did, not, have, the, extended, connotation, of, overweening, pride, self, confidence, or, arrogance, often, resulting, in, fatal, retribution, in, ancient, greece, hubris, referred, to, actions, which, intentionally, or, not, shamed, and, humiliated, the, victim, and, frequently, the, perpetrator, as, well, it, was, most, evident, in, the, public, and, private, actions, of, the, powerful, and, rich, violations, of, the, law, against, hubris, included, what, would, today, be, termed, assault, and, battery, sexual, crimes, ranging, from, forcible, rape, of, women, or, children, to, consensual, but, improper, activities, or, the, theft, of, public, or, sacred, property, two, well, known, cases, are, found, in, the, speeches, of, demosthenes, a, prominent, statesman, and, orator, in, ancient, greece, these, two, examples, occurred, when, first, in, addition, to, other, acts, of, violence, meidias, allegedly, punched, demosthenes, in, the, face, in, the, theater, against, meidias, and, second, against, konon, when, the, defendant, allegedly, severely, beat, him, hubris, though, not, specifically, defined, was, a, legal, term, and, was, considered, a, crime, in, classical, athens, it, was, also, considered, the, greatest, sin, of, the, ancient, greek, world, that, was, so, because, it, not, only, was, proof, of, excessive, pride, but, also, resulted, in, violent, acts, by, or, to, those, involved, the, category, of, acts, constituting, hubris, for, the, ancient, greeks, apparently, broadened, from, the, original, specific, reference, to, mutilation, of, a, corpse, or, a, humiliation, of, a, defeated, foe, or, irreverent, outrageous, treatment, in, general, the, meaning, was, eventually, further, generalized, in, its, modern, english, usage, to, apply, to, any, outrageous, act, or, exhibition, of, pride, or, disregard, for, basic, moral, laws, such, an, act, may, be, referred, to, as, an, act, of, hubris, or, the, person, committing, the, act, may, be, said, to, be, hubristic, at, greek, for, ruin, folly, delusion, is, the, action, performed, by, the, hero, usually, because, of, their, hubris, or, great, pride, that, leads, to, their, death, or, downfall, crucial, to, this, definition, are, the, ancient, greek, concepts, of, honor, tim, and, shame, the, concept, of, tim, included, not, only, the, exaltation, of, the, one, receiving, honor, but, also, the, shaming, of, the, one, overcome, by, the, act, of, hubris, this, concept, of, honor, is, akin, to, a, zero, sum, game, rush, rehm, simplifies, this, definition, to, the, contemporary, concept, of, insolence, contempt, and, excessive, violence, the, indian, penal, code, covers, the, punishments, and, types, of, assault, in, chapter, 16, sections, 351, through, 358, whoever, makes, any, gesture, or, any, preparation, intending, or, knowing, it, to, be, likely, that, such, gesture, or, preparation, will, cause, any, person, present, to, apprehend, that, he,

found, guilty, of, assaulting, a, shop, assistant, by, simply, jumping, over, a, counter, while, wearing, a, ski, mask, the, court, said, n, assault, may, be, constituted, by, threatening, gestures, sufficient, to, produce, alarm, scots, law, also, provides, for, a, more, serious, charge, of, aggravated, assault, on, the, basis, of, such, factors, as, severity, of, injury, the, use, of, a, weapon, or, hamesucken, to, assault, a, person, in, their, own, home, the, mens, rea, for, assault, is, simply, evil, intent, although, this, has, been, held, to, mean, no, more, than, that, assault,

however, the, crime, of, assault, can, encompass, acts, in, which, no, battery, is, intended, but, the, defendant, s, act, nonetheless, creates, reasonable, fear, in, others, that, a, battery, will, occur, four, elements, were, required, at, common, law, as, the, criminal, law, evolved, element, one, was, weakened, in, most, jurisdictions, so, that, a, reasonable, fear, of, bodily, injury, would, suffice, these, four, elements, were, eventually, codified, in, most, states, the, crime, of, assault, generally, requires, that, both, the, perpetrator, and, the, victim, of, an, assault, be, a, natural, person, thus, unless, the, attack, is, directed, by, a, person, an, animal, attack, does, not, constitute, an, assault, however, under, limited, circumstances, the, unborn, victims, of, violence, act, of, 2004, treats, a, fetus, as, a, separate, person, for, the, purposes, of, assault, and, other, violent, crimes, possible, examples, of, defenses, mitigating, circumstances, or,
