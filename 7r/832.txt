feminism, is, a, range, of, socio, political, movements, and, ideologies, that, aim, to, define, and, establish, the, political, economic, personal, and, social, equality, of, the, sexes, feminism, holds, the, position, that, modern, societies, are, patriarchal, they, prioritize, the, male, point, of, view, and, that, women, are, treated, unjustly, in, these, societies, efforts, to, change, this, include, fighting, against, gender, stereotypes, and, improving, educational, professional, and, interpersonal, opportunities, and, outcomes, for, women, originating, in, late, 18th, century, europe, feminist, movements, have, campaigned, and, continue, to, campaign, for, women, s, rights, including, the, right, to, vote, run, for, public, office, work, earn, equal, pay, own, property, receive, education, enter, into, contracts, have, equal, rights, within, marriage, and, maternity, leave, feminists, have, also, worked, to, ensure, access, to, contraception, legal, abortions, and, social, integration, and, to, protect, women, and, girls, from, sexual, assault, sexual, harassment, and, domestic, violence, changes, in, female, dress, standards, and, acceptable, physical, activities, for, women, have, also, been, part, of, feminist, movements, many, scholars, consider, feminist, campaigns, to, be, a, main, force, behind, major, historical, societal, changes, for, women, s, rights, particularly, in, the, west, where, they, are, near, universally, credited, with, achieving, women, s, suffrage, gender, neutral, language, reproductive, rights, for, women, including, access, to, contraceptives, and, abortion, and, the, right, to, enter, into, contracts, and, own, property, although, feminist, advocacy, is, and, has, been, mainly, focused, on, women, s, rights, some, argue, for, the, inclusion, of, men, s, liberation, within, its, aims, because, they, believe, that, men, are, also, harmed, by, traditional, gender, roles, feminist, theory, which, emerged, from, feminist, movements, aims, to, understand, the, nature, of, gender, inequality, by, examining, women, s, social, roles, and, lived, experiences, feminist, theorists, have, developed, theories, in, a, variety, of, disciplines, in, order, to, respond, to, issues, concerning, gender, numerous, feminist, movements, and, ideologies, have, developed, over, the, years, representing, different, viewpoints, and, political, aims, traditionally, since, the, 19th, century, first, wave, liberal, feminism, which, sought, political, and, legal, equality, through, reforms, within, a, liberal, democratic, framework, was, contrasted, with, labour, based, proletarian, women, s, movements, that, over, time, developed, into, socialist, and, marxist, feminism, based, on, class, struggle, theory, since, the, 1960s, both, of, these, traditions, are, also, contrasted, with, the, radical, feminism, that, arose, from, the, radical, wing, of, second, wave, feminism, and, that, calls, for, a, radical, reordering, of, society, to, eliminate, patriarchy, liberal, socialist, and, radical, feminism, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, big, three, schools, of, feminist, thought, since, the, late, 20th, century, many, newer, forms, of, feminism, have, emerged, some, forms, such, as, white, feminism, and, gender, critical, feminism, have, been, criticized, as, taking, into, account, only, white, middle, class, college, educated, heterosexual, or, cisgender, perspectives, these, criticisms, have, led, to, the, creation, of, ethnically, specific, or, multicultural, forms, of, feminism, such, as, black, feminism, and, intersectional, feminism, some, have, argued, that, feminism, often, promotes, misandry, and, the, elevation, of, women, s, interests, above, men, s, and, criticize, radical, feminist, positions, as, harmful, to, both, men, and, women, mary, wollstonecraft, is, seen, by, many, as, a, founder, of, feminism, due, to, her, 1792, book, titled, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, in, which, she, argues, that, class, and, private, property, are, the, basis, of, discrimination, against, women, and, that, women, as, much, as, men, needed, equal, rights, charles, fourier, a, utopian, socialist, and, french, philosopher, is, credited, with, having, coined, the, word, f, minisme, in, 1837, but, no, trace, of, the, word, have, been, found, in, his, works, the, word, f, minisme, feminism, first, appeared, in, france, in, 1871, in, a, medicine, thesis, about, men, suffering, from, tuberculosis, and, having, developed, according, to, the, author, ferdinand, val, re, faneau, de, la, cour, feminine, traits, the, word, f, ministe, feminist, inspired, by, its, medical, use, was, coined, by, alexandre, dumas, fils, in, a, 1872, essay, referring, to, men, who, supported, women, rights, in, both, cases, the, use, of, the, word, was, very, negative, and, reflected, a, criticism, of, a, so, called, confusion, of, the, sexes, by, women, who, refused, to, abide, by, the, sexual, division, of, society, and, challenged, the, inequalities, between, sexes, the, concepts, appeared, in, the, netherlands, in, 1872, great, britain, in, the, 1890s, and, the, united, states, in, 1910, the, oxford, english, dictionary, dates, the, first, appearance, in, english, in, this, meaning, back, to, 1895, depending, on, the, historical, moment, culture, and, country, feminists, around, the, world, have, had, different, causes, and, goals, most, western, feminist, historians, contend, that, all, movements, working, to, obtain, women, s, rights, should, be, considered, feminist, movements, even, when, they, did, not, or, do, not, apply, the, term, to, themselves, other, historians, assert, that, the, term, should, be, limited, to, the, modern, feminist, movement, and, its, descendants, those, historians, use, the, label, protofeminist, to, describe, earlier, movements, the, history, of, the, modern, western, feminist, movement, is, divided, into, multiple, waves, the, first, comprised, women, s, suffrage, movements, of, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, promoting, women, s, right, to, vote, the, second, wave, the, women, s, liberation, movement, began, in, the, 1960s, and, campaigned, for, legal, and, social, equality, for, women, in, or, around, 1992, a, third, wave, was, identified, characterized, by, a, focus, on, individuality, and, diversity, additionally, some, have, argued, for, the, existence, of, a, fourth, wave, starting, around, 2012, which, has, used, social, media, to, combat, sexual, harassment, violence, against, women, and, rape, culture, it, is, best, known, for, the, me, too, movement, first, wave, feminism, was, a, period, of, activity, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th,

european, countries, married, women, still, had, very, few, rights, for, instance, in, france, married, women, did, not, receive, the, right, to, work, without, their, husband, s, permission, until, 1965, feminists, have, also, worked, to, abolish, the, marital, exemption, in, rape, laws, which, precluded, the, prosecution, of, husbands, for, the, rape, of, their, wives, earlier, efforts, by, first, wave, feminists, such, as, voltairine, de, cleyre, victoria, woodhull, and, elizabeth, clarke, wolstenholme, elmy, to, criminalize, marital, rape, in, the, late, 19th, century, had, failed,

egyptian, policy, and, society, began, to, move, away, from, women, s, equality, with, the, new, islamist, movement, and, growing, conservatism, however, some, activists, proposed, a, new, feminist, movement, islamic, feminism, which, argues, for, women, s, equality, within, an, islamic, framework, in, latin, america, revolutions, brought, changes, in, women, s, status, in, countries, such, as,

arguing, that, women, are, devitalised, and, repressed, in, their, role, as, housewives, and, mothers, third, wave, feminism, is, traced, to, the, emergence, of, the, riot, grrrl, feminist, punk, subculture, in, olympia, washington, in, the, early, 1990s, and, to, anita, hill, s, televised, testimony, in, 1991, to, an, all, male, all, white, senate, judiciary, committee, that, clarence,

what, it, deemed, the, second, wave, s, essentialist, definitions, of, femininity, which, third, wave, feminists, argued, overemphasized, the, experiences, of, upper, middle, class, white, women, third, wave, feminists, often, focused, on, micro, politics, and, challenged, the, second, wave, s, paradigm, as, to, what, was, or, was, not, good, for, women, and, tended, to, use, a, post, structuralist, interpretation, of, gender, and, sexuality, feminist, leaders, rooted, in, the, second, wave, such, as, gloria, anzald, a, bell, hooks, chela, sandoval, cherr, e, moraga, audre, lorde, maxine, hong, kingston, and, many, other, non, white, feminists, sought, to, negotiate, a, space, within, feminist, thought, for, consideration, of, race, related, subjectivities, third, wave, feminism, also, contained, internal, debates, between, difference, feminists, who, believe, that, there, are, important, psychological, differences, between, the, sexes, and, those, who, believe, that, there, are, no, inherent, psychological, differences, between, the, sexes, and, contend, that, gender, roles, are, due, to, social, conditioning, standpoint, theory, is, a, feminist, theoretical, point, of, view, stating, that, a, person, s, social, position, influences, their, knowledge, this, perspective, argues, that, research, and, theory, treat, women, and, the, feminist, movement, as, insignificant, and, refuses, to, see, traditional, science, as, unbiased, since, the, 1980s, standpoint, feminists, have, argued, that, the, feminist, movement, should, address, global, issues, such, as, rape, incest, and, prostitution, and, culturally, specific, issues, such, as, female, genital, mutilation, in, some, parts, of, africa, and, arab, societies, as, well, as, glass, ceiling, practices, that, impede, women, s, advancement, in, developed, economies, in, order, to, understand, how, gender, inequality, interacts, with, racism, homophobia, classism, and, colonization, in, a, matrix, of, domination, fourth, wave, feminism, is, a, proposed, extension, of, third, wave, feminism, which, corresponds, to, a, resurgence, in, interest, in, feminism, beginning, around, 2012, and, associated, with, the, use, of, social, media, according, to, feminist, scholar, prudence, chamberlain, the, focus, of, the, fourth, wave, is, justice, for, women, and, opposition, to, sexual, harassment, and, violence, against, women, its, essence, she, writes, is, incredulity, that, certain, attitudes, can, still, exist, fourth, wave, feminism, is, defined, by, technology, according, to, kira, cochrane, and, is, characterized, particularly, by, the, use, of, facebook, twitter, instagram, youtube, tumblr, and, blogs, such, as, feministing, to, challenge, misogyny, and, further, gender, equality, issues, that, fourth, wave, feminists, focus, on, include, street, and, workplace, harassment, campus, sexual, assault, and, rape, culture, scandals, involving, the,

very, formation, of, gender, and, its, subsequent, formations, of, patriarchy, and, the, gender, binary, not, as, universal, constants, across, cultures, but, as, structures, that, have, been, instituted, by, and, for, the, benefit, of, european, colonialism, mar, a, lugones, proposes, that, decolonial, feminism, speaks, to, how, the, colonial, imposition, of, gender, cuts, across, questions, of, ecology, economics, government, relations, with, the, spirit, world, and, knowledge, as, well, as, across, everyday, practices, that, either, habituate, us, to, take, care, of, the, world, or, to, destroy, it, decolonial, feminists, like, karla, jessen, williamson, and, rauna, kuokkanen, have, examined, colonialism, as, a, force, that, has, imposed, gender, hierarchies, on, indigenous, women, that, have, disempowered, and, fractured, indigenous, communities, and, ways, of, life, the, term, postfeminism, is, used, to, describe, a, range, of, viewpoints, reacting, to, feminism, since, the, 1980s, while, not, being, anti, feminist, postfeminists, believe, that, women, have, achieved, second, wave, goals, while, being, critical, of, third, and, fourth, wave, feminist, goals, the, term, was, first, used, to, describe, a, backlash, against, second, wave, feminism, but, it, is, now, a, label, for, a, wide, range, of, theories, that, take, critical, approaches, to, previous, feminist, discourses, and, includes, challenges, to, the, second, wave, s, ideas, other, postfeminists, say, that, feminism, is, no, longer, relevant, to, today, s, society, amelia, jones, has, written, that, the, postfeminist, texts, which, emerged, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, portrayed, second, wave, feminism, as, a, monolithic, entity, dorothy, chunn, describes, a, blaming, narrative, under, the, postfeminist, moniker, where, feminists, are, undermined, for, continuing, to, make, demands, for, gender, equality, in, a, post, feminist, society, where, gender, equality, has, already, been, achieved, according, to, chunn, many, feminists, have, voiced, disquiet, about, the, ways, in, which, rights, and, equality, discourses, are, now, used, against, them, feminist, theory, is, the, extension, of, feminism, into, theoretical, or, philosophical, fields, it, encompasses, work, in, a, variety, of, disciplines, including, anthropology, sociology, economics, women, s, studies, literary, criticism, art, history, psychoanalysis, and, philosophy, feminist, theory, aims, to, understand, gender, inequality, and, focuses, on, gender, politics, power, relations, and, sexuality, while, providing, a, critique, of, these, social, and, political, relations, much, of, feminist, theory, also, focuses, on, the, promotion, of, women, s, rights, and, interests, themes, explored, in, feminist, theory, include, discrimination, stereotyping, objectification, especially, sexual, objectification, oppression, and, patriarchy, in, the, field, of, literary, criticism, elaine, showalter, describes, the, development, of, feminist, theory, as, having, three, phases, the, first, she, calls, feminist, critique, in, which, the, feminist, reader, examines, the, ideologies, behind, literary, phenomena, the, second, showalter, calls, gynocriticism, in, which, the, woman, is, producer, of, textual, meaning, the, last, phase, she, calls, gender, theory, in, which, the, ideological, inscription, and, the, literary, effects, of, the, sex, gender, system, are, explored, this, was, paralleled, in, the, 1970s, by, french, feminists, who, developed, the, concept, of, criture, f, minine, which, translates, as, female, or, feminine, writing, h, l, ne, cixous, argues, that, writing, and, philosophy, are, phallocentric, and, along, with, other, french, feminists, such, as, luce, irigaray, emphasize, writing, from, the, body, as, a, subversive, exercise, the, work, of, julia, kristeva, a, feminist, psychoanalyst, and, philosopher, and, bracha, ettinger, artist, and, psychoanalyst, has, influenced, feminist, theory, in, general, and, feminist, literary, criticism, in, particular, however, as, the, scholar, elizabeth, wright, points, out, none, of, these, french, feminists, align, themselves, with, the, feminist, movement, as, it, appeared, in, the, anglophone, world, many, overlapping, feminist, movements, and, ideologies, have, developed, over, the, years, feminism, is, often, divided, into, three, main, traditions, called, liberal, radical, and, socialist, marxist, feminism, sometimes, known, as, the, big, three, schools, of, feminist, thought, since, the, late, 20th, century, newer, forms, of, feminisms, have, also, emerged, some, branches, of, feminism, track, the, political, leanings, of, the, larger, society, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, or, focus, on, specific, topics, such, as, the, environment, liberal, feminism, also, known, under, other, names, such, as, reformist, mainstream, or, historically, as, bourgeois, feminism, arose, from, 19th, century, first, wave, feminism, and, was, historically, linked, to, 19th, century, liberalism, and, progressivism, while, 19th, century, conservatives, tended, to, oppose, feminism, as, such, liberal, feminism, seeks, equality, of, men, and, women, through, political, and, legal, reform, within, a, liberal, democratic, framework, without, radically, altering, the, structure, of, society, liberal, feminism, works, within, the, structure, of, mainstream, society, to, integrate, women, into, that, structure, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, liberal, feminism, focused, especially, on, women, s, suffrage, and, access, to, education, former, norwegian, supreme, court, justice, and, former, president, of, the, liberal, norwegian, association, for, women, s, rights, karin, maria, bruzelius, has, described, liberal, feminism, as, a, realistic, sober, practical, feminism, susan, wendell, argues, that, liberal, feminism, is, an, historical, tradition, that, grew, out, of, liberalism, as, can, be, seen, very, clearly, in, the, work, of, such, feminists, as, mary, wollstonecraft, and, john, stuart, mill, but, feminists, who, took, principles, from, that, tradition, have, developed, analyses, and, goals, that, go, far, beyond, those, of, 18th, and, 19th, century, liberal, feminists, and, many, feminists, who, have, goals, and, strategies, identified, as, liberal, feminist, reject, major, components, of, liberalism, in, a, modern, or, party, political, sense, she, highlights, equality, of, opportunity, as, a, defining, feature, of, liberal, feminism, liberal, feminism, is, a, very, broad, term, that, encompasses, many, often, diverging, modern, branches, and, a, variety, of, feminist, and, general, political, perspectives, some, historically, liberal, branches, are, equality, feminism, social, feminism, equity, feminism, difference, feminism, individualist, libertarian, feminism, and, some, forms, of, state, feminism, particularly, the, state, feminism, of, the, nordic, countries, the, broad, field, of, liberal, feminism, is, sometimes, confused, with, the, more, recent, and, smaller, branch, known, as, libertarian, feminism, which, tends, to, diverge, significantly, from, mainstream, liberal, feminism, for, example, libertarian, feminism, does, not, require, social, measures, to, reduce, material, inequality, in, fact, it, opposes, such, measures, in, contrast, liberal, feminism, may, support, such, requirements, and, egalitarian, versions, of, feminism, insist, on, them, catherine, rottenberg, notes, that, the, raison, d, tre, of, classic, liberal, feminism, was, to, pose, an, immanent, critique, of, liberalism, revealing, the, gendered, exclusions, within, liberal, democracy, s, proclamation, of, universal, equality, particularly, with, respect, to, the, law, institutional, access, and, the, full, incorporation, of, women, into, the, public, sphere, rottenberg, contrasts, classic, liberal, feminism, with, modern, neoliberal, feminism, which, seems, perfectly, in, sync, with, the, evolving, neoliberal, order, according, to, zhang, and, rios, liberal, feminism, tends, to, be, adopted, by, mainstream, i, e, middle, class, women, who, do, not, disagree, with, the, current, social, structure, they, found, that, liberal, feminism, with, its, focus, on, equality, is, viewed, as, the, dominant, and, default, form, of, feminism, some, modern, forms, of, feminism, that, historically, grew, out, of, the, broader, liberal, tradition, have, more, recently, also, been, described, as, conservative, in, relative, terms, this, is, particularly, the, case, for, libertarian, feminism, which, conceives, of, people, as, self, owners, and, therefore, as, entitled, to, freedom, from, coercive, interference, radical, feminism, arose, from, the, radical, wing, of, second, wave, feminism, and, calls, for, a, radical, reordering, of, society, to, eliminate, male, supremacy, it, considers, the, male, controlled, capitalist, hierarchy, as, the, defining, feature, of, women, s, oppression, and, the, total, uprooting, and, reconstruction, of, society, as, necessary, separatist, feminism, does, not, support, heterosexual, relationships, lesbian, feminism, is, thus, closely, related, other, feminists, criticize, separatist, feminism, as, sexist, rosemary, hennessy, and, chrys, ingraham, say, that, materialist, forms, of, feminism, grew, out, of, western, marxist, thought, and, have, inspired, a, number, of, different, but, overlapping, movements, all, of, which, are, involved, in, a, critique, of, capitalism, and, are, focused, on, ideology, s, relationship, to, women, marxist, feminism, argues, that, capitalism, is, the, root, cause, of, women, s, oppression, and, that, discrimination, against, women, in, domestic, life, and, employment, is, an, effect, of, capitalist, ideologies, socialist, feminism, distinguishes, itself, from, marxist, feminism, by, arguing, that, women, s, liberation, can, only, be, achieved, by, working, to, end, both, the, economic, and, cultural, sources, of, women, s, oppression, anarcha, feminists, believe, that, class, struggle, and, anarchy, against, the, state, require, struggling, against, patriarchy, which, comes, from, involuntary, hierarchy, ecofeminists, see, men, s, control, of, land, as, responsible, for, the, oppression, of, women, and, destruction, of, the, natural, environment, ecofeminism, has, been, criticized, for, focusing, too, much, on, a, mystical, connection, between, women, and, nature, sara, ahmed, argues, that, black, and, postcolonial, feminisms, pose, a, challenge, to, some, of, the, organizing, premises, of, western, feminist, thought, during, much, of, its, history, feminist, movements, and, theoretical, developments, were, led, predominantly, by, middle, class, white, women, from, western, europe, and, north, america, however, women, of, other, races, have, proposed, alternative, feminisms, this, trend, accelerated, in, the, 1960s, with, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, united, states, and, the, end, of, western, european, colonialism, in, africa, the, caribbean, parts, of, latin, america, and, southeast, asia, since, that, time, women, in, developing, nations, and, former, colonies, and, who, are, of, colour, or, various, ethnicities, or, living, in, poverty, have, proposed, additional, feminisms, womanism, emerged, after, early, feminist, movements, were, largely, white, and, middle, class, postcolonial, feminists, argue, that, colonial, oppression, and, western, feminism, marginalized, postcolonial, women, but, did, not, turn, them, passive, or, voiceless, third, world, feminism, and, indigenous, feminism, are, closely, related, to, postcolonial, feminism, these, ideas, also, correspond, with, ideas, in, african, feminism, motherism, stiwanism, negofeminism, femalism, transnational, feminism, and, africana, womanism, in, the, late, 20th, century, various, feminists, began, to, argue, that, gender, roles, are, socially, constructed, and, that, it, is, impossible, to, generalize, women, s, experiences, across, cultures, and, histories, post, structural, feminism, draws, on, the, philosophies, of, post, structuralism, and, deconstruction, in, order, to, argue, that, the, concept, of, gender, is, created, socially, and, culturally, through, discourse, postmodern, feminists, also, emphasize, the, social, construction, of, gender, and, the, discursive, nature, of, reality, however, as, pamela, abbott, et, al, write, a, postmodern, approach, to, feminism, highlights, the, existence, of, multiple, truths, rather, than, simply, men, and, women, s, standpoints, third, wave, feminists, tend, to, view, the, struggle, for, trans, rights, as, an, integral, part, of, intersectional, feminism, fourth, wave, feminists, also, tend, to, be, trans, inclusive, the, american, national, organization, for, women, now, president, terry, o, neill, said, the, struggle, against, transphobia, is, a, feminist, issue, and, now, has, affirmed, that, trans, women, are, women, trans, girls, are, girls, several, studies, have, found, that, people, who, identify, as, feminists, tend, to, be, more, accepting, of, trans, people, than, those, who, do, not, an, ideology, variously, known, as, trans, exclusionary, radical, feminism, or, its, acronym, terf, or, gender, critical, feminism, is, critical, of, concepts, of, gender, identity, and, transgender, rights, holding, that, biological, sex, characteristics, are, an, immutable, determination, of, gender, or, supersede, the, importance, of, gender, identity, that, trans, women, are, not, women, and, that, trans, men, are, not, men, these, views, have, been, described, as, transphobic, by, many, other, feminists, riot, grrrls, took, an, anti, corporate, stance, of, self, sufficiency, and, self, reliance, riot, grrrl, s, emphasis, on, universal, female, identity, and, separatism, often, appears, more, closely, allied, with, second, wave, feminism, than, with, the, third, wave, the, movement, encouraged, and, made, adolescent, girls, standpoints, central, allowing, them, to, express, themselves, fully, lipstick, feminism, is, a, cultural, feminist, movement, that, attempts, to, respond, to, the, backlash, of, second, wave, radical, feminism, of, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, by, reclaiming, symbols, of, feminine, identity, such, as, make, up, suggestive, clothing, and, having, a, sexual, allure, as, valid, and, empowering, personal, choices, according, to, 2014, ipsos, poll, covering, 15, developed, countries, 53, percent, of, respondents, identified, as, feminists, and, 87, percent, agreed, that, women, should, be, treated, equally, to, men, in, all, areas, based, on, their, competency, not, their, gender, however, only, 55, percent, of, women, agreed, that, they, have, full, equality, with, men, and, the, freedom, to, reach, their, full, dreams, and, aspirations, taken, together, these, studies, reflect, the, importance, differentiating, between, claiming, a, feminist, identity, and, holding, feminist, attitudes, or, beliefs, according, to, a, 2015, poll, 18, percent, of, americans, use, the, label, of, feminist, to, describe, themselves, while, 85, percent, are, feminists, in, practice, as, they, reported, they, believe, in, equality, for, women, the, poll, found, that, 52, percent, did, not, identify, as, feminist, 26, percent, were, unsure, and, 4, percent, provided, no, response, sociological, research, shows, that, in, the, us, increased, educational, attainment, is, associated, with, greater, support, for, feminist, issues, in, addition, politically, liberal, people, are, more, likely, to, support, feminist, ideals, compared, to, those, who, are, conservative, according, to, a, 2016, survation, poll, for, the, fawcett, society, 7, percent, of, britons, use, the, label, of, feminist, to, describe, themselves, while, 83, percent, say, they, support, equality, of, opportunity, for, women, this, included, higher, support, from, men, 86, than, women, 81, feminist, views, on, sexuality, vary, and, have, differed, by, historical, period, and, by, cultural, context, feminist, attitudes, to, female, sexuality, have, taken, a, few, different, directions, matters, such, as, the, sex, industry, sexual, representation, in, the, media, and, issues, regarding, consent, to, sex, under, conditions, of, male, dominance, have, been, particularly, controversial, among, feminists, this, debate, has, culminated, in, the, late, 1970s, and, the, 1980s, in, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, feminist, sex, wars, which, pitted, anti, pornography, feminism, against, sex, positive, feminism, and, parts, of, the, feminist, movement, were, deeply, divided, by, these, debates, feminists, have, taken, a, variety, of, positions, on, different, aspects, of, the, sexual, revolution, from, the, 1960s, and, 70s, over, the, course, of, the, 1970s, a, large, number, of, influential, women, accepted, lesbian, and, bisexual, women, as, part, of, feminism, opinions, on, the, sex, industry, are, diverse, feminists, who, are, critical, of, the, sex, industry, generally, see, it, as, the, exploitative, result, of, patriarchal, social, structures, which, reinforce, sexual, and, cultural, attitudes, complicit, in, rape, and, sexual, harassment, alternately, feminists, who, support, at, least, part, of, the, sex, industry, argue, that, it, can, be, a, medium, of, feminist, expression, and, reflect, a, woman, s, right, to, control, and, define, her, own, sexuality, individualist, feminists, support, the, existence, of, a, sex, industry, on, the, grounds, that, adult, women, have, the, right, to, consent, to, sexual, acts, as, they, choose, and, should, have, access, to, labor, rights, to, earn, money, how, they, choose, in, this, view, banning, the, sex, industry, effectively, strips, women, of, their, right, to, work, and, earn, money, on, their, own, terms, treating, them, as, children, who, cannot, make, decisions, for, themselves, in, this, view, women, who, consider, the, sex, industry, degrading, do, not, have, to, partake, in, it, women, who, do, choose, to, work, in, the, sex, industry, however, should, not, be, banned, from, doing, so, given, that, they, are, doing, so, willingly, libertarian, feminist, zine, reclaim, has, argued, that, sex, work, has, helped, more, women, including, students, freelancers, and, women, in, poverty, achieve, financial, independence, than, all, government, grants, combined, feminist, views, of, pornography, range, from, condemnation, of, pornography, as, a, form, of, violence, against, women, to, an, embracing, of, some, forms, of, pornography, as, a, medium, of, feminist, expression, and, a, legitimate, career, similarly, feminists, views, on, prostitution, vary, ranging, from, critical, to, supportive, for, feminists, a, woman, s, right, to, control, her, own, sexuality, is, a, key, issue, and, one, that, is, heavily, contested, between, different, branches, of, feminism, radical, feminists, such, as, catharine, mackinnon, argue, that, women, have, very, little, control, over, their, own, bodies, with, female, sexuality, being, largely, controlled, and, defined, by, men, in, patriarchal, societies, radical, feminists, argue, that, sexual, violence, committed, by, men, is, often, rooted, in, ideologies, of, male, sexual, entitlement, and, that, these, systems, grant, women, very, few, legitimate, options, to, refuse, sexual, advances, some, radical, feminists, have, argued, that, women, should, not, engage, in, heterosexual, sex, and, choose, lesbianism, as, a, lifestyle, and, political, choice, a, view, that, has, fallen, out, of, favor, as, sexuality, is, seen, as, largely, biologically, influenced, rather, than, a, choice, one, can, make, for, political, reasons, some, radical, feminists, argue, that, all, cultures, are, in, one, way, or, another, dominated, by, ideologies, that, deny, women, s, right, to, sexual, expression, because, men, under, a, patriarchy, define, sex, on, their, own, terms, this, entitlement, can, take, different, forms, depending, on, the, culture, in, some, conservative, and, religious, cultures, marriage, is, regarded, as, an, institution, which, requires, a, wife, to, be, sexually, available, at, all, times, virtually, without, limit, thus, forcing, or, coercing, sex, on, a, wife, is, not, considered, a, crime, or, even, an, abusive, behaviour, in, 1968, radical, feminist, anne, koedt, argued, in, her, essay, the, myth, of, the, vaginal, orgasm, that, women, s, biology, and, the, clitoral, orgasm, had, not, been, properly, analyzed, and, popularized, because, men, have, orgasms, essentially, by, friction, with, the, vagina, and, not, the, clitoral, area, other, branches, of, feminism, such, as, individualist, feminism, consider, themselves, sex, positive, and, see, women, s, expression, of, their, own, sexuality, as, a, right, in, this, view, what, is, or, is, not, degrading, is, subjective, and, each, person, has, a, right, to, decide, for, themselves, what, sexual, acts, they, find, degrading, and, if, they, want, to, participate, in, them, or, not, individualist, feminist, wendy, mcelroy, wrote, in, her, book, xxx, a, woman, s, right, to, pornography, let, s, examine, the, idea, that, pornography, is, degrading, to, women, degrading, is, a, subjective, term, personally, i, find, detergent, commercials, in, which, women, become, orgasmic, over, soapsuds, to, be, tremendously, degrading, to, women, i, find, movies, in, which, prostitutes, are, treated, like, ignorant, drug, addicts, to, be, slander, against, women, every, woman, has, the, right, the, need, to, define, degradation, for, herself, according, to, this, view, part, of, sexual, autonomy, is, the, right, to, define, one, s, boundaries, desires, and, limits, around, their, sexuality, rather, than, accept, a, narrative, in, which, all, women, are, victims, of, men, during, a, sex, act, sandra, harding, says, that, the, moral, and, political, insights, of, the, women, s, movement, have, inspired, social, scientists, and, biologists, to, raise, critical, questions, about, the, ways, traditional, researchers, have, explained, gender, sex, and, relations, within, and, between, the, social, and, natural, worlds, some, feminists, such, as, ruth, hubbard, and, evelyn, fox, keller, criticize, traditional, scientific, discourse, as, being, historically, biased, towards, a, male, perspective, a, part, of, the, feminist, research, agenda, is, the, examination, of, the, ways, in, which, power, inequities, are, created, or, reinforced, in, scientific, and, academic, institutions, physicist, lisa, randall, appointed, to, a, task, force, at, harvard, by, then, president, lawrence, summers, after, his, controversial, discussion, of, why, women, may, be, underrepresented, in, science, and, engineering, said, i, just, want, to, see, a, whole, bunch, more, women, enter, the, field, so, these, issues, don, t, have, to, come, up, anymore, lynn, hankinson, nelson, writes, that, feminist, empiricists, find, fundamental, differences, between, the, experiences, of, men, and, women, thus, they, seek, to, obtain, knowledge, through, the, examination, of, the, experiences, of, women, and, to, uncover, the, consequences, of, omitting, misdescribing, or, devaluing, them, to, account, for, a, range, of, human, experience, another, part, of, the, feminist, research, agenda, is, the, uncovering, of, ways, in, which, power, inequities, are, created, or, reinforced, in, society, and, in, scientific, and, academic, institutions, furthermore, despite, calls, for, greater, attention, to, be, paid, to, structures, of, gender, inequity, in, the, academic, literature, structural, analyses, of, gender, bias, rarely, appear, in, highly, cited, psychological, journals, especially, in, the, commonly, studied, areas, of, psychology, and, personality, one, criticism, of, feminist, epistemology, is, that, it, allows, social, and, political, values, to, influence, its, findings, susan, haack, also, points, out, that, feminist, epistemology, reinforces, traditional, stereotypes, about, women, s, thinking, as, intuitive, and, emotional, etc, meera, nanda, further, cautions, that, this, may, in, fact, trap, women, within, traditional, gender, roles, and, help, justify, patriarchy, modern, feminism, challenges, the, essentialist, view, of, gender, as, biologically, intrinsic, for, example, anne, fausto, sterling, s, book, myths, of, gender, explores, the, assumptions, embodied, in, scientific, research, that, support, a, biologically, essentialist, view, of, gender, in, delusions, of, gender, cordelia, fine, disputes, scientific, evidence, that, suggests, that, there, is, an, innate, biological, difference, between, men, s, and, women, s, minds, asserting, instead, that, cultural, and, societal, beliefs, are, the, reason, for, differences, between, individuals, that, are, commonly, perceived, as, sex, differences, feminism, in, psychology, emerged, as, a, critique, of, the, dominant, male, outlook, on, psychological, research, where, only, male, perspectives, were, studied, with, all, male, subjects, as, women, earned, doctorates, in, psychology, women, and, their, issues, were, introduced, as, legitimate, topics, of, study, feminist, psychology, emphasizes, social, context, lived, experience, and, qualitative, analysis, projects, such, as, psychology, s, feminist, voices, have, emerged, to, catalogue, the, influence, of, feminist, psychologists, on, the, discipline, there, is, a, long, history, of, feminist, activity, in, design, disciplines, like, industrial, design, graphic, design, and, fashion, design, this, work, has, explored, topics, like, beauty, diy, feminine, approaches, to, design, and, community, based, projects, some, iconic, writing, includes, cheryl, buckley, s, essays, on, design, and, patriarchy,

solutions, feminist, activists, have, established, a, range, of, feminist, businesses, including, feminist, bookstores, credit, unions, presses, mail, order, catalogs, and, restaurants, these, businesses, flourished, as, part, of, the, second, and, third, waves, of, feminism, in, the, 1970s, 1980s, and, 1990s, corresponding, with, general, developments, within, feminism, and, often, including, such, self, organizing, tactics, as, the, consciousness, raising, group, the, movement, began, in, the, 1960s, and, flourished, throughout, the, 1970s, jeremy, strick, director, of, the, museum, of, contemporary, art, in, los, angeles, described, the, feminist, art, movement, as, the, most, influential, international, movement, of, any, during, the, postwar, period, and, peggy, phelan, says, that, it, brought, about, the, most, far, reaching, transformations, in, both, artmaking, and, art, writing, over, the, past, four, decades, feminist, artist, judy, chicago, who, created, the, dinner, party, a, set, of, vulva, themed, ceramic, plates, in, the, 1970s, said, in, 2009, to, artnews, there, is, still, an, institutional, lag, and, an, insistence, on, a, male, eurocentric, narrative, we, are, trying, to, change, the, future, to, get, girls, and, boys, to, realize, that, women, s, art, is, not, an, exception, it, s, a, normal, part, of, art, history, a, feminist, approach, to, the, visual, arts, has, most, recently, developed, through, cyberfeminism, and, the, posthuman, turn, giving, voice, to, the, ways, contemporary, female, artists, are, dealing, with, gender, social, media, and, the, notion, of, embodiment, the, feminist, movement, produced, feminist, fiction, feminist, non, fiction, and, feminist, poetry, which, created, new, interest, in, women, s, writing, it, also, prompted, a, general, reevaluation, of, women, s, historical, and, academic, contributions, in, response, to, the, belief, that, women, s, lives, and, contributions, have, been, underrepresented, as, areas, of, scholarly, interest, there, has, also, been, a, close, link, between, feminist, literature, and, activism, with, feminist, writing, typically, voicing, key, concerns, or, ideas, of, feminism, in, a, particular, era, much, of, the, early, period, of, feminist, literary, scholarship, was, given, over, to, the, rediscovery, and, reclamation, of, texts, written, by, women, in, western, feminist, literary, scholarship, studies, like, dale, spender, s, mothers, of, the, novel, 1986, and, jane, spencer, s, the, rise, of, the, woman, novelist, 1986, were, ground, breaking, in, their, insistence, that, women, have, always, been, writing, commensurate, with, this, growth, in, scholarly, interest, various, presses, began, the, task, of, reissuing, long, out, of, print, texts, virago, press, began, to, publish, its, large, list, of, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, novels, in, 1975, and, became, one, of, the, first, commercial, presses, to,

within, a, literary, tradition, dominated, by, patriarchy, the, widespread, interest, in, women, s, writing, is, related, to, a, general, reassessment, and, expansion, of, the, literary, canon, interest, in, post, colonial, literatures, gay, and, lesbian, literature, writing, by, people, of, colour, working, people, s, writing, and, the, cultural, productions, of, other, historically, marginalized, groups, has, resulted, in, a, whole, scale, expansion, of, what, is, considered, literature, and, genres, hitherto, not, regarded, as, literary, such, as, children, s, writing, journals, letters, travel, writing, and, many, others, are, now, the, subjects, of, scholarly, interest, most, genres, and, subgenres, have, undergone, a, similar, analysis, so, literary, studies, have, entered, new, territories, such, as, the, female, gothic, or, women, s, science, fiction, according, to, elyce, rae, helford, science, fiction, and, fantasy, serve, as, important, vehicles, for, feminist, thought, particularly, as, bridges, between, theory, and, practice, feminist, science, fiction, is, sometimes, taught, at, the, university, level, to, explore, the, role, of, social,

of, feminism, though, they, identify, as, feminists, they, argue, for, example, that, feminism, often, promotes, misandry, and, the, elevation, of, women, s, interests, above, men, s, and, criticize, radical, feminist, positions, as, harmful, to, both, men, and, women, daphne, patai, and, noretta, koertge, argue, that, the, term, anti, feminist, is, used, to, silence, academic, debate, about,
