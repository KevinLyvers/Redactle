indonesian, bahasa, indonesia, is, the, official, and, national, language, of, indonesia, it, is, a, standardized, variety, of, malay, an, austronesian, language, that, has, been, used, as, a, lingua, franca, in, the, multilingual, indonesian, archipelago, for, centuries, with, over, 280, million, inhabitants, indonesia, ranks, as, the, fourth, most, populous, nation, globally, according, to, the, 2020, census, over, 97, of, indonesians, are, fluent, in, indonesian, making, it, the, largest, language, by, number, of, speakers, in, southeast, asia, and, one, of, the, most, widely, spoken, languages, in, the, world, indonesian, vocabulary, has, been, influenced, by, various, regional, languages, such, as, javanese, sundanese, minangkabau, balinese, banjarese, and, buginese, as, well, as, by, foreign, languages, such, as, arabic, dutch, portuguese, and, english, many, borrowed, words, have, been, adapted, to, fit, the, phonetic, and, grammatical, rules, of, indonesian, enriching, the, language, and, reflecting, indonesia, s, diverse, linguistic, heritage, most, indonesians, aside, from, speaking, the, national, language, are, fluent, in, at, least, one, of, the, more, than, 700, indigenous, local, languages, examples, include, javanese, and, sundanese, which, are, commonly, used, at, home, and, within, the, local, community, however, most, formal, education, and, nearly, all, national, mass, media, governance, administration, and, judiciary, and, other, forms, of, communication, are, conducted, in, indonesian, under, indonesian, rule, from, 1976, to, 1999, indonesian, was, designated, as, the, official, language, of, timor, leste, it, has, the, status, of, a, working, language, under, the, country, s, constitution, along, with, english, 3, in, november, 2023, the, indonesian, language, was, recognized, as, one, of, the, official, languages, of, the, unesco, general, conference, the, term, indonesian, is, primarily, associated, with, the, national, standard, dialect, bahasa, baku, however, in, a, looser, sense, it, also, encompasses, the, various, local, varieties, spoken, throughout, the, indonesian, archipelago, standard, indonesian, is, confined, mostly, to, formal, situations, existing, in, a, diglossic, relationship, with, vernacular, malay, varieties, which, are, commonly, used, for, daily, communication, coexisting, with, the, aforementioned, regional, languages, and, with, malay, creoles, standard, indonesian, is, spoken, in, informal, speech, as, a, lingua, franca, between, vernacular, malay, dialects, malay, creoles, and, regional, languages, the, indonesian, name, for, the, language, bahasa, indonesia, is, also, occasionally, used, in, english, and, other, languages, bahasa, indonesia, is, sometimes, improperly, reduced, to, bahasa, which, refers, to, the, indonesian, subject, bahasa, indonesia, taught, in, schools, on, the, assumption, that, this, is, the, name, of, the, language, but, the, word, bahasa, only, means, language, for, example, french, language, is, translated, as, bahasa, prancis, and, the, same, applies, to, other, languages, such, as, bahasa, inggris, english, bahasa, jepang, japanese, bahasa, arab, arabic, bahasa, italia, italian, and, so, on, indonesians, generally, may, not, recognize, the, name, bahasa, alone, when, it, refers, to, their, national, language, standard, indonesian, is, a, standard, language, of, riau, malay, which, despite, its, common, name, is, not, based, on, the, vernacular, malay, dialects, of, the, riau, islands, but, rather, represents, a, form, of, classical, malay, as, used, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, in, the, riau, lingga, sultanate, classical, malay, had, emerged, as, a, literary, language, in, the, royal, courts, along, both, shores, of, the, strait, of, malacca, including, the, johor, sultanate, and, malacca, sultanate, originally, spoken, in, northeast, sumatra, malay, has, been, used, as, a, lingua, franca, in, the, indonesian, archipelago, for, half, a, millennium, it, might, be, attributed, to, its, ancestor, the, old, malay, language, which, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 7th, century, the, kedukan, bukit, inscription, is, the, oldest, surviving, specimen, of, old, malay, the, language, used, by, srivijayan, empire, since, the, 7th, century, the, old, malay, language, has, been, used, in, nusantara, archipelago, indonesian, archipelago, evidenced, by, srivijaya, inscriptions, and, by, other, inscriptions, from, coastal, areas, of, the, archipelago, such, as, sojomerto, inscription, trade, contacts, carried, on, by, various, ethnic, peoples, at, the, time, were, the, main, vehicle, for, spreading, the, old, malay, language, which, was, the, main, communications, medium, among, the, traders, ultimately, the, old, malay, language, became, a, lingua, franca, and, was, spoken, widely, by, most, people, in, the, archipelago, indonesian, in, its, standard, form, has, essentially, the, same, material, basis, as, the, malaysian, standard, of, malay, and, is, therefore, considered, to, be, a, variety, of, the, pluricentric, malay, language, however, it, does, differ, from, malaysian, malay, in, several, respects, with, differences, in, pronunciation, and, vocabulary, these, differences, are, due, mainly, to, the, dutch, and, javanese, influences, on, indonesian, indonesian, was, also, influenced, by, the, melayu, pasar, lit, market, malay, which, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, archipelago, in, colonial, times, and, thus, indirectly, by, other, spoken, languages, of, the, islands, malaysian, malay, claims, to, be, closer, to, the, classical, malay, of, earlier, centuries, even, though, modern, malaysian, has, been, heavily, influenced, in, lexicon, as, well, as, in, syntax, by, english, the, question, of, whether, high, malay, court, malay, or, low, malay, bazaar, malay, was, the, true, parent, of, the, indonesian, language, is, still, in, debate, high, malay, was, the, official, language, used, in, the, court, of, the, johor, sultanate, and, continued, by, the, dutch, administered, territory, of, riau, lingga, while, low, malay, was, commonly, used, in, marketplaces, and, ports, of, the, archipelago, some, linguists, have, argued, that, it, was, the, more, common, low, malay, that, formed, the, base, of, the, indonesian, language, when, the, dutch, east, india, company, voc, first, arrived, in, the, archipelago, at, the, start, of, the, 1600s, the, malay, language, was, a, significant, trading, and, political, language, due, to, the, influence, of, the, malaccan, sultanate, and, later, the, portuguese, however, the, language, had, never, been, dominant, among, the, population, of, the, indonesian, archipelago, as, it, was, limited, to, mercantile, activity, the, voc, adopted, the, malay, language, as, the, administrative, language, of, their, trading, outpost, in, the, east, following, the, bankruptcy, of, the, voc, the, batavian, republic, took, control, of, the, colony, in, 1799, and, it, was, only, then, that, education, in, and, promotion, of, dutch, began, in, the, colony, even, then, dutch, administrators, were, remarkably, reluctant, to, promote, the, use, of, dutch, compared, to, other, colonial, regimes, dutch, thus, remained, the, language, of, a, small, elite, in, 1940, only, 2, of, the, total, population, could, speak, dutch, nevertheless, it, did, have, a, significant, influence, on, the, development, of, malay, in, the, colony, during, the, colonial, era, the, language, that, would, be, standardized, as, indonesian, absorbed, a, large, amount, of, dutch, vocabulary, in, the, form, of, loanwords, the, nationalist, movement, that, ultimately, brought, indonesian, to, its, national, language, status, rejected, dutch, from, the, outset, however, the, rapid, disappearance, of, dutch, was, a, very, unusual, case, compared, with, other, colonized, countries, where, the, colonial, language, generally, has, continued, to, function, as, the, language, of, politics, bureaucracy, education, technology, and, other, fields, of, importance, for, a, significant, time, after, independence, the, indonesian, scholar, soenjono, dardjowidjojo, even, goes, so, far, as, to, say, that, when, compared, to, the, situation, in, other, asian, countries, such, as, india, malaysia, singapore, and, the, philippines, indonesian, is, perhaps, the, only, language, that, has, achieved, the, status, of, a, national, language, in, its, true, sense, since, it, truly, dominates, in, all, spheres, of, indonesian, society, the, ease, with, which, indonesia, eliminated, the, language, of, its, former, colonial, power, can, perhaps, be, explained, as, much, by, dutch, policy, as, by, indonesian, nationalism, in, marked, contrast, to, the, french, spanish, and, portuguese, who, pursued, an, assimilation, colonial, policy, or, even, the, british, the, dutch, did, not, attempt, to, spread, their, language, among, the, indigenous, population, in, fact, they, consciously, prevented, the, language, from, being, spread, by, refusing, to, provide, education, especially, in, dutch, to, the, native, indonesians, so, they, would, not, come, to, see, themselves, as, equals, moreover, the, dutch, wished, to, prevent, the, indonesians, from, elevating, their, perceived, social, status, by, taking, on, elements, of, dutch, culture, thus, until, the, 1930s, they, maintained, a, minimalist, regime, and, allowed, malay, to, spread, quickly, throughout, the, archipelago, dutch, dominance, at, that, time, covered, nearly, all, aspects, with, official, forums, requiring, the, use, of, dutch, although, since, the, second, youth, congress, 1928, the, use, of, indonesian, as, the, national, language, was, agreed, on, as, one, of, the, tools, in, the, independence, struggle, as, of, it, mohammad, hoesni, thamrin, inveighed, actions, underestimating, indonesian, after, some, criticism, and, protests, the, use, of, indonesian, was, allowed, since, the, volksraad, sessions, held, in, july, 1938, by, the, time, they, tried, to, counter, the, spread, of, malay, by, teaching, dutch, to, the, natives, it, was, too, late, and, in, 1942, the, japanese, conquered, indonesia, the, japanese, mandated, that, all, official, business, be, conducted, in, indonesian, and, quickly, outlawed, the, use, of, the, dutch, language, three, years, later, the, indonesians, themselves, formally, abolished, the, language, and, established, bahasa, indonesia, as, the, national, language, of, the, new, nation, the, term, bahasa, indonesia, itself, had, been, proposed, by, mohammad, tabrani, in, 1926, and, tabrani, had, further, proposed, the, term, over, calling, the, language, malay,

indonesia, the, renewal, of, malay, language, until, it, became, indonesian, it, had, to, be, done, by, the, experts, of, the, new, nature, the, national, nature, of, indonesia, ki, hajar, dewantara, in, the, congress, of, indonesian, language, i, 1938, solo, several, years, prior, to, the, congress, swiss, linguist, renward, brandstetter, wrote, an, introduction, to, indonesian, linguistics, in, 4, essays, from, 1910, to, 1915, the, essays, were, translated, into, english, in, 1916, by, indonesia, he, meant, the, name, of, the, geographical, region, and, by, indonesian, languages, he, meant, malayo, polynesian, languages, west, of, new, guinea, because, by, that, time, there, was, still, no, notion, of, indonesian, language, sutan, takdir, alisjahbana, was, a, great, promoter, of, the, use, and, development, of, indonesian, and, he, was, greatly, exaggerating, the, decline, of, dutch, higher, education, was, still, in, dutch, and, many, educated, indonesians, were, writing, and, speaking, in, dutch, in, many, situations, and, were, still, doing, so, well, after, independence, was, achieved, he, believed, passionately, in, the, need, to, develop, indonesian, so, that, it, could, take, its, place, as, a, fully, adequate, national, language, able, to, replace, dutch, as, a, means, of, entry, into, modern, international, culture, in, 1933, he, began, the, magazine, pujangga, baru, new, writer, poedjangga, baroe, in, the, original, spelling, with, co, editors, amir, hamzah, and, armijn, pane, the, language, of, pujangga, baru, came, in, for, criticism, from, those, associated, with, the, more, classical, school, malay, and, it, was, accused, of, publishing, dutch, written, with, an, indonesian, vocabulary, alisjahbana, would, no, doubt, have, taken, the, criticism, as, a, demonstration, of, his, success, to, him, the, language, of, pujangga, baru, pointed, the, way, to, the, future, to, an, elaborated, westernised, language, able, to, express, all, the, concepts, of, the, modern, world, as, an, example, among, the, many, innovations, they, condemned, was, use, of, the, word, bisa, instead, of, dapat, for, can, in, malay, bisa, meant, only, poison, from, an, animal, s, bite, and, the, increasing, use, of, javanese, bisa, in, the, new, meaning, they, regarded, as, one, of, the, many, threats, to, the, language, s, purity, unlike, more, traditional, intellectuals, he, did, not, look, to, classical, malay, and, the, past, for, him, indonesian, was, a, new, concept, a, new, beginning, was, needed, and, he, looked, to, western, civilisation, with, its, dynamic, society, of, individuals, freed, from, traditional, fetters, as, his, inspiration, the, prohibition, on, use, of, dutch, led, to, an, expansion, of, indonesian, language, newspapers, and, pressure, on, them, to, increase, the, language, s, wordstock, the, japanese, agreed, to, the, establishment, of, the, komisi, bahasa, language, commission, in, october, 1942, formally, headed, by, three, japanese, but, with, a, number, of, prominent, indonesian, intellectuals, playing, the, major, part, in, its, activities, soewandi, later, to, be, minister, of, education, and, culture, was, appointed, secretary, alisjahbana, was, appointed, an, expert, secretary, and, other, members, included, the, future, president, and, vice, president, sukarno, and, hatta, journalists, beginning, a, practice, that, has, continued, to, the, present, did, not, wait, for, the, komisi, bahasa, to, provide, new, words, but, actively, participated, themselves, in, coining, terms, many, of, the, komisi, bahasa, s, terms, never, found, public, acceptance, and, after, the, japanese, period, were, replaced, by, the, original, dutch, forms, including, jantera, sanskrit, for, wheel, which, temporarily, replaced, mesin, machine, ketua, negara, literally, chairman, of, state, which, had, replaced, presiden, president, and, kilang, meaning, mill, which, had, replaced, pabrik, factory, in, a, few, cases, however, coinings, permanently, replaced, earlier, dutch, terms, including, pajak, earlier, meaning, monopoly, instead, of, belasting, tax, and, senam, meaning, exercise, instead, of, gimnastik, gymnastics, the, komisi, bahasa, is, said, to, have, coined, more, than, 7000, terms, although, few, of, these, gained, common, acceptance, the, adoption, of, indonesian, as, the, country, s, national, language, was, in, contrast, to, most, other, post, colonial, states, neither, the, language, with, the, most, native, speakers, javanese, nor, the, language, of, the, former, european, colonial, power, dutch, was, to, be, adopted, instead, a, local, language, with, far, fewer, native, speakers, than, the, most, widely, spoken, local, language, was, chosen, nevertheless, malay, was, the, second, most, widely, spoken, language, in, the, colony, after, javanese, and, had, many, l2, speakers, using, it, for, trade, administration, and, education, in, 1945, when, indonesia, declared, its, independence, indonesian, was, formally, declared, the, national, language, despite, being, the, native, language, of, only, about, 5, of, the, population, in, contrast, javanese, and, sundanese, were, the, mother, tongues, of, 42, 48, and, 15, respectively, the, combination, of, nationalistic, political, and, practical, concerns, ultimately, led, to, the, successful, adoption, of, indonesian, as, a, national, language, in, 1945, javanese, was, easily, the, most, prominent, language, in, indonesia, it, was, the, native, language, of, nearly, half, the, population, the, primary, language, of, politics, and, economics, and, the, language, of, courtly, religious, and, literary, tradition, what, it, lacked, however, was, the, ability, to, unite, the, diverse, indonesian, population, as, a, whole, with, thousands, of, islands, and, hundreds, of, different, languages, the, newly, independent, country, of, indonesia, had, to, find, a, national, language, that, could, realistically, be, spoken, by, the, majority, of, the, population, and, that, would, not, divide, the, nation, by, favouring, one, ethnic, group, namely, the, javanese, over, the, others, in, 1945, indonesian, was, already, in, widespread, use, in, fact, it, had, been, for, roughly, a, thousand, years, over, that, long, period, malay, which, would, later, become, standardized, as, indonesian, was, the, primary, language, of, commerce, and, travel, it, was, also, the, language, used, for, the, propagation, of, islam, in, the, 13th, to, 17th, centuries, as, well, as, the, language, of, instruction, used, by, portuguese, and, dutch, missionaries, attempting, to, convert, the, indigenous, people, to, christianity, the, combination, of, these, factors, meant, that, the, language, was, already, known, to, some, degree, by, most, of, the, population, and, it, could, be, more, easily, adopted, as, the, national, language, than, perhaps, any, other, moreover, it, was, the, language, of, the, sultanate, of, brunei, and, of, future, malaysia, on, which, some, indonesian, nationalists, had, claims, over, the, first, 53, years, of, indonesian, independence, the, country, s, first, two, presidents, sukarno, and, suharto, constantly, nurtured, the, sense, of, national, unity, embodied, by, indonesian, and, the, language, remains, an, essential, component, of, indonesian, identity, through, a, language, planning, program, that, made, indonesian, the, language, of, politics, education, and, nation, building, in, general, indonesian, became, one, of, the, few, success, stories, of, an, indigenous, language, effectively, overtaking, that, of, a, country, s, colonisers, to, become, the, de, jure, and, de, facto, official, language, today, indonesian, continues, to, function, as, the, language, of, national, identity, as, the, congress, of, indonesian, youth, envisioned, and, also, serves, as, the, language, of, education, literacy, modernization, and, social, mobility, despite, still, being, a, second, language, to, most, indonesians, it, is, unquestionably, the, language, of, the, indonesian, nation, as, a, whole, as, it, has, had, unrivalled, success, as, a, factor, in, nation, building, and, the, strengthening, of, indonesian, identity, indonesian, is, spoken, as, a, mother, tongue, and, national, language, over, 200, million, people, regularly, make, use, of, the, national, language, with, varying, degrees, of, proficiency, in, a, nation, that, is, home, to, more, than, 700, native, languages, and, a, vast, array, of, ethnic, groups, it, plays, an, important, unifying, and, cross, archipelagic, role, for, the, country, use, of, the, national, language, is, abundant, in, the, media, government, bodies, schools, universities, workplaces, among, members, of, the, upper, class, or, nobility, and, also, in, formal, situations, despite, the, 2010, census, showing, only, 19, 94, of, over, five, year, olds, speak, mainly, indonesian, at, home, standard, indonesian, is, used, in, books, and, newspapers, and, on, television, radio, news, broadcasts, the, standard, dialect, however, is, rarely, used, in, daily, conversations, being, confined, mostly, to, formal, settings, while, this, is, a, phenomenon, common, to, most, languages, in, the, world, for, example, spoken, english, does, not, always, correspond, to, its, written, standards, the, proximity, of, spoken, indonesian, in, terms, of, grammar, and, vocabulary, to, its, normative, form, is, noticeably, low, this, is, mostly, due, to, indonesians, combining, aspects, of, their, own, local, languages, e, g, javanese, sundanese, and, balinese, with, indonesian, this, results, in, various, vernacular, varieties, of, indonesian, the, very, types, that, a, foreigner, is, most, likely, to, hear, upon, arriving, in, any, indonesian, city, or, town, this, phenomenon, is, amplified, by, the, use, of, indonesian, slang, particularly, in, the, cities, unlike, the, relatively, uniform, standard, variety, vernacular, indonesian, exhibits, a, high, degree, of, geographical, variation, though, colloquial, jakartan, indonesian, functions, as, the, de, facto, norm, of, informal, language, and, is, a, popular, source, of, influence, throughout, the, archipelago, there, is, language, shift, of, first, language, among, indonesian, into, indonesian, from, other, language, in, indonesia, caused, by, ethnic, diversity, than, urbanicity, the, most, common, and, widely, used, colloquial, indonesian, is, heavily, influenced, by, the, betawi, language, a, malay, based, creole, of, jakarta, amplified, by, its, popularity, in, indonesian, popular, culture, in, mass, media, and, jakarta, s, status, as, the, national, capital, in, informal, spoken, indonesian, various, words, are, replaced, with, those, of, a, less, formal, nature, for, example, tidak, no, is, often, replaced, with, the, betawi, form, nggak, or, the, even, simpler, gak, ga, while, seperti, like, similar, to, is, often, replaced, with, kayak, sangat, or, amat, very, the, term, to, express, intensity, is, often, replaced, with, the, javanese, influenced, banget, as, for, pronunciation, the, diphthongs, ai, and, au, on, the, end, of, base, words, are, typically, pronounced, as, e, and, o, in, informal, writing, the, spelling, of, words, is, modified, to, reflect, the, actual, pronunciation, in, a, way, that, can, be, produced, with, less, effort, for, example, capai, becomes, cape, or, capek, pakai, becomes, pake, kalau, becomes, kalo, in, verbs, the, prefix, me, is, often, dropped, although, an, initial, nasal, consonant, is, often, retained, as, when, mengangkat, becomes, ngangkat, the, basic, word, is, angkat, the, suffixes, kan, and, i, are, often, replaced, by, in, for, example, mencarikan, becomes, nyariin, menuruti, becomes, nurutin, the, latter, grammatical, aspect, is, one, often, closely, related, to, the, indonesian, spoken, in, jakarta, and, its, surrounding, areas, malay, historical, linguists, agree, on, the, likelihood, of, the, malay, homeland, being, in, western, borneo, stretching, to, the, bruneian, coast, a, form, known, as, proto, malay, language, was, spoken, in, borneo, at, least, by, 1000, bce, and, was, it, has, been, argued, the, ancestral, language, of, all, subsequent, malayan, languages, its, ancestor, proto, malayo, polynesian, a, descendant, of, the, proto, austronesian, language, began, to, break, up, by, at, least, 2000, bce, possibly, as, a, result, of, the, southward, expansion, of, austronesian, peoples, into, maritime, southeast, asia, from, the, island, of, taiwan, indonesian, which, originated, from, malay, is, a, member, of, the, austronesian, family, of, languages, which, includes, languages, from, southeast, asia, the, pacific, ocean, and, madagascar, with, a, smaller, number, in, continental, asia, it, has, a, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, with, the, malaysian, standard, of, malay, which, is, officially, known, there, as, bahasa, malaysia, despite, the, numerous, lexical, differences, however, vernacular, varieties, spoken, in, indonesia, and, malaysia, share, limited, intelligibility, which, is, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, malaysians, have, difficulties, understanding, indonesian, sinetron, soap, opera, aired, on, malaysia, tv, stations, and, vice, versa, malagasy, a, geographic, outlier, spoken, in, madagascar, in, the, indian, ocean, the, philippines, national, language, filipino, formosan, in, taiwan, s, aboriginal, population, and, the, native, m, ori, language, of, new, zealand, are, also, members, of, this, language, family, although, each, language, of, the, family, is, mutually, unintelligible, their, similarities, are, rather, striking, many, roots, have, come, virtually, unchanged, from, their, common, ancestor, proto, austronesian, language, there, are, many, cognates, found, in, the, languages, words, for, kinship, health, body, parts, and, common, animals, numbers, especially, show, remarkable, similarities, there, are, more, than, 700, local, languages, in, indonesian, islands, such, as, javanese, sundanese, etc, while, malay, as, the, source, of, indonesian, is, the, mother, tongue, of, ethnic, malay, who, lives, along, the, east, coast, of, sumatra, in, the, riau,

trade, languages, thus, a, large, proportion, of, indonesian, at, least, use, two, language, daily, those, are, indonesian, and, local, languages, when, two, languages, are, used, by, the, same, people, in, this, way, they, are, likely, to, influence, each, other, aside, from, local, languages, dutch, made, the, highest, contribution, to, the, indonesian, vocabulary, due, to, the, dutch, colonization, over, three, centuries, from, the, 16th, century, until, the, mid, 20th, century, asian, languages, also, influenced, the, language, with, chinese, influencing, indonesian, during, the,

century, followed, by, arabic, after, the, spread, of, islam, in, the, archipelago, in, the, 13th, century, loanwords, from, portuguese, were, mainly, connected, with, articles, that, the, early, european, traders, and, explorers, brought, to, southeast, asia, indonesian, also, receives, many, english, words, as, a, result, of, globalization, and, modernization, especially, since, the, 1990s, as, far, as, the, internet, s, emergence, and, development, until, the, present, day, some, indonesian, words, correspond, to, malay, loanwords, in, english, among, them, the, common, words, orangutan, gong, bamboo, rattan, sarong, and, the, less, common, words, such, as, paddy, sago, and, kapok, all, of, which, were, inherited, in, indonesian, from, malay, but, borrowed, from, malay, in, english, the, phrase, to, run, amok, comes, from, the, malay, verb, amuk, to, run, out, of, control, to, rage, indonesian, is, neither, a, pidgin, nor, a, creole, since, its, characteristics, do, not, meet, any, of, the, criteria, for, either, it, is, believed, that, the, indonesian, language, was, one, of, the, means, to, achieve, independence, but, it, is, opened, to, receive, vocabulary, from, other, foreign, languages, aside, from, malay, that, it, has, made, contact, with, since, the, colonialism, era, such, as, dutch, english, and, arabic, among, others, as, the, loan, words, keep,

vietnam, taiwan, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, indonesian, is, the, official, language, of, indonesia, and, its, use, is, encouraged, throughout, the, indonesian, archipelago, it, is, regulated, in, chapter, xv, 1945, constitution, of, indonesia, about, the, flag, official, language, coat, of, arms, and, national, anthem, of, indonesia, also, in, chapter, iii, section, 25, to, 45, government, regulation, no, 24, 2009, mentions, explicitly, the, status, of, the, indonesian, language, the, national, language, is, indonesian, indonesian, functions, as, a, symbol, of, national, identity, and, pride, and, is, a, lingua, franca, among, the, diverse, ethnic, groups, in, indonesia, and, the, speakers, of, vernacular, malay, dialects, and, malay, creoles, the, indonesian, language, serves, as, the, national, and, official, language, the, language, of, education, communication, transaction, and, trade, documentation, the, development, of, national, culture, science, technology, and, mass, media, it, also, serves, as, a, vehicle, of, communication, among, the, provinces, and, different, regional, cultures, in, the, country, according, to, indonesian, law, the, indonesian, language, was, proclaimed, as, the, unifying, language, during, the, youth, pledge, on, 28, october, 1928, and, developed, further, to, accommodate, the, dynamics, of, indonesian, civilization, as, mentioned, previously, the, language, was, based, on, riau, malay, though, linguists, note, that, this, is, not, the, local, dialect, of, riau, but, the, malaccan, dialect, that, was, used, in, the, riau, court, since, its, conception, in, 1928, and, its, official, recognition, in, the, 1945, constitution, the, indonesian, language, has, been, loaded, with, a, nationalist, political, agenda, to, unify, indonesia, former, dutch, east, indies, this, status, has, made, it, relatively, open, to, accommodate, influences, from, other, indonesian, ethnic, languages, most, notably, javanese, as, the, majority, ethnic, group, and, dutch, as, the, previous, coloniser, compared, to, the, indigenous, dialects, of, malay, spoken, in, sumatra, and, malay, peninsula, or, the, normative, malaysian, standard, the, indonesian, language, differs, profoundly, by, a, large, amount, of, javanese, loanwords, incorporated, into, its, already, rich, vocabulary, as, a, result, indonesian, has, more, extensive, sources, of, loanwords, compared, to, malaysian, malay, the, disparate, evolution, of, indonesian, and, malaysian, has, led, to, a, rift, between, the, two, standardized, varieties, this, has, been, based, more, upon, political, nuance, and, the, history, of, their, standardization, than, cultural, reasons, and, as, a, result, there, are, asymmetrical, views, regarding, each, other, s, variety, among, malaysians, and, indonesians, malaysians, tend, to, assert, that, malaysian, and, indonesian, are, merely, different, normative, varieties, of, the, same, language, while, indonesians, tend, to, treat, them, as, separate, albeit, closely, related, languages, consequently, indonesians, feel, little, need, to, harmonise, their, language, with, malaysia, and, brunei, whereas, malaysians, are, keener, to, coordinate, the, evolution, of, the, language, with, indonesians, although, the, 1972, indonesian, alphabet, reform, was, seen, mainly, as, a, concession, of, dutch, based, indonesian, to, the, english, based, spelling, of, malaysian, in, november, 2023, the, indonesian, language, was, recognised, as, one, of, the, official, languages, of, the, unesco, general, conference, currently, there, are, 10, official, languages, of, the, unesco, general, conference, consisting, of, the, six, united, nations, languages, namely, english, french, arabic, chinese, russian, and, spanish, as, well, as, four, other, languages, of, unesco, member, countries, namely, hindi, italian, portuguese, and, indonesian, as, regulated, by, indonesian, state, law, uu, no, 24, 2009, other, than, state, official, speeches, and, documents, between, or, issued, to, indonesian, government, indonesian, language, is, required, by, law, to, be, used, in, however, other, languages, may, be, used, in, dual, language, setting, to, accompany, but, not, to, replace, indonesian, language, in, agreements, information, regarding, goods, services, scientific, papers, information, through, mass, media, geographical, names, public, signs, road, signs, public, facilities, banners, and, other, information, of, public, services, in, public, area, while, there, are, no, sanctions, of, the, uses, of, other, languages, in, indonesian, court, s, point, of, view, any, agreements, made, in, indonesia, but, not, drafted, in, indonesian, language, is, null, and, void, in, any, different, interpretations, in, dual, language, agreements, setting, indonesian, language, shall, prevail, indonesian, has, six, vowel, phonemes, as, shown, in, the, table, below, in, standard, indonesian, orthography, the, latin, alphabet, is, used, and, five, vowels, are, distinguished, a, i, u, e, o, in, materials, for, learners, the, mid, front, vowel, e, is, sometimes, represented, with, a, diacritic, as, to, distinguish, it, from, the, mid, central, vowel, since, 2015, the, auxiliary, graphemes, and, are, used, respectively, for, phonetic, and, in, indonesian, while, standard, malay, has, rendered, both, of, them, as, the, phonetic, realization, of, the, mid, vowels, e, and, o, ranges, from, close, mid, to, open, mid, allophones, some, analyses, set, up, a, system, which, treats, the, open, mid, vowels, and, as, distinct, phonemes, poedjosoedarmo, argued, the, split, of, the, front, mid, vowels, in, indonesian, is, due, to, javanese, influence, which, exhibits, a, difference, between, i, and, another, example, of, javanese, influence, in, indonesian, is, the, split, of, back, mid, vowels, into, two, allophones, of, and, these, splits, and, loanwords, increase, instances, of, doublets, in, indonesian, such, as, satai, and, sat, javanese, words, adopted, into, indonesian, have, greatly, increased, the, frequency, of, indonesian, and, o, high, vowels, i, u, could, not, appear, in, a, final, syllable, in, traditional, malay, if, a, mid, vowel, e, o, happened, in, the, previous, syllable, and, mid, vowels, could, not, occur, in, the, final, syllable, if, a, high, vowel, was, present, in, the, second, to, last, syllable, traditional, malay, does, not, allow, the, mid, central, schwa, vowel, to, occur, in, consonant, open, or, closed, word, final, syllables, the, schwa, vowel, was, introduced, in, closed, syllables, under, the, influence, of, javanese, and, jakarta, malay, but, dutch, borrowings, made, it, more, acceptable, although, alisjahbana, argued, against, it, insisting, on, writing, a, instead, of, an, in, final, syllables, such, as, koda, vs, kod, code, and, nasionalisma, vs, nasionalism, nationalism, he, was, unsuccessful, this, spelling, convention, was, instead, survived, in, balinese, orthography, indonesian, has, four, diphthong, phonemes, only, in, open, syllables, they, are, some, analyses, assume, that, these, diphthongs, are, actually, a, monophthong, followed, by, an, approximant, so, ai, represents, aj, au, represents, aw, and, oi, represents, oj, on, this, basis, there, are, no, phonological, diphthongs, in, indonesian, diphthongs, are, differentiated, from, two, vowels, in, two, syllables, such, as, the, consonants, of, indonesian, are, shown, above, non, native, consonants, that, only, occur, in, borrowed, words, principally, from, arabic, and, english, are, shown, in, parentheses, some, analyses, list, 19, primary, consonants, for, indonesian, as, the, 18, symbols, that, are, not, in, parentheses, in, the, table, as, well, as, the, glottal, stop, the, secondary, consonants, f, v, z, and, x, only, appear, in, loanwords, some, speakers, pronounce, v, in, loanwords, as, otherwise, it, is, likewise, x, may, be, replaced, with, or, by, some, speakers, is, sometimes, replaced, with, s, which, was, traditionally, used, as, a, substitute, for, in, older, borrowings, from, sanskrit, and, f, is, rarely, replaced, though, p, was, substituted, for, f, in, older, borrowings, such, as, kopi, coffee, from, dutch, koffie, z, may, occasionally, be, replaced, with, s, or, d, can, also, be, an, allophone, of, s, before, voiced, consonants, according, to, some, analyses, postalveolar, affricates, t, and, d, are, instead, palatals, and, in, indonesian, the, consonants, in, indonesian, are, influenced, by, other, important, languages, in, indonesian, history, the, influences, included, schwa, in, final, closed, syllable, e, g, indonesian, p, c, l, vs, malay, p, cal, initial, homorganic, nasal, stop, clusters, of, mb, nd, and, nj, e, g, indonesian, mbolos, to, malinger, the, consonant, semivowel, clusters, e, g, indonesian, pria, vs, malay, p, ria, male, introduction, of, consonant, clusters, ry, and, ly, e, g, indonesian, g, rilya, vs, malay, g, rila, guerrilla, increased, usage, of, initial, w, e, g, warta, and, b, rita, news, and, intervocalic, w, and, increase, of, initial, and, post, consonant, y, these, changes, resulted, from, influences, of, local, languages, in, indonesia, such, as, balinese, madurese, sundanese, and, especially, javanese, and, foreign, languages, such, as, arabic, and, dutch, orthographic, note, the, sounds, are, represented, orthographically, by, their, symbols, as, above, except, indonesian, has, light, stress, that, falls, on, either, the, final, or, penultimate, syllable, depending, on, regional, variations, as, well, as, the, presence, of, the, schwa, in, a, word, it, is, generally, the, penultimate, syllable, that, is, stressed, unless, its, vowel, is, a, schwa, if, the, penult, has, a, schwa, then, stress, usually, moves, to, the, final, syllable, however, there, is, some, disagreement, among, linguists, over, whether, stress, is, phonemic, unpredictable, with, some, analyses, suggesting, that, there, is, no, underlying, stress, in, indonesian, the, classification, of, languages, based, on, rhythm, can, be, problematic, nevertheless, acoustic, measurements, suggest, that, indonesian, has, more, syllable, based, rhythm, than, british, english, even, though, doubts, remain, about, whether, the, syllable, is, the, appropriate, unit, for, the, study, of, malay, prosody, word, order, in, indonesian, is, generally, subject, verb, object, svo, similar, to, that, of, most, modern, european, languages, as, well, as, english, however, considerable, flexibility, in, word, ordering, exists, in, contrast, with, languages, such, as, japanese, or, korean, for, instance, which, always, end, clauses, with, verbs, indonesian, while, allowing, for, relatively, flexible, word, orderings, does, not, mark, for, grammatical, case, nor, does, it, make, use, of, grammatical, gender, indonesian, words, are, composed, of, a, root, or, a, root, plus, derivational, affixes, the, root, is, the, primary, lexical, unit, of, a, word, and, is, usually, bisyllabic, of, the, shape, cv, c, cv, c, affixes, are, glued, onto, roots, which, are, either, nouns, or, verbs, to, alter, or, expand, the, primary, meaning, associated, with, a, given, root, effectively, generating, new, words, for, example, masak, to, cook, may, become, memasak, cooking, memasakkan, cook, for, dimasak, be, cooked, pemasak, a, cook, masakan, a, meal, cookery, termasak, accidentally, cooked, there, are, four, types, of, affixes, prefixes, awalan, suffixes, akhiran, circumfixes, apitan, and, infixes, sisipan, affixes, are, categorized, into, noun, verb, and, adjective, affixes, many, initial, consonants, alternate, in, the, presence, of, prefixes, sapu, to, sweep, becomes, menyapu, sweeps, sweeping, panggil, to, call, becomes, memanggil, calls, calling, tapis, to, sieve, becomes, menapis, sieves, other, examples, of, the, use, of, affixes, to, change, the, meaning, of, a, word, can, be, seen, with, the, word, ajar, to, teach, kan, and, i, both, increase, the, valency, of, verbs, but, i, should, be, used, if, is, directly, followed, by, an, animate, object, noun, affixes, are, affixes, that, form, nouns, upon, addition, to, root, words, the, following, are, examples, of, noun, affixes, the, prefix, per, drops, its, r, before, r, l, and, frequently, before, p, t, k, in, some, words, it, is, peng, though, formally, distinct, these, are, treated, as, variants, of, the, same, prefix, in, indonesian, grammar, books, similarly, verb, affixes, in, indonesian, are, attached, to, root, words, to, form, verbs, in, indonesian, there, are, adjective, affixes, are, attached, to, root, words, to, form, adjectives, in, addition, to, these, affixes, indonesian, also, has, a, lot, of, borrowed, affixes, from, other, languages, such, as, sanskrit, arabic, and, english, for, example, maha, pasca, eka, bi, anti, pro, etc, common, derivational, affixes, for, nouns, are, peng, per, juru, actor, instrument, or, someone, characterized, by, the, root, an, collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument, ke, an, abstractions, and, qualities, collectivities, per, peng, an, abstraction, place, goal, or, result, indonesian, does, not, make, use, of, grammatical, gender, and, there, are, only, selected, words, that, use, natural, gender, for, instance, the, same, word, is, used, for, he, him, and, she, her, dia, or, ia, or, for, his, and, her, dia, ia, or, nya, no, real, distinction, is, made, between, girlfriend, and, boyfriend, both, of, which, can, be, referred, to, as, pacar, although, more, colloquial, terms, as, cewek, girl, girlfriend, and, cowok, boy, boyfriend, can, also, be, found, a, majority, of, indonesian, words, that, refer, to, people, generally, have, a, form, that, does, not, distinguish, between, the, natural, genders, however, unlike, english, distinction, is, made, between, older, or, younger, there, are, some, words, that, have, gender, for, instance, putri, means, daughter, while, putra, means, son, pramugara, means, male, flight, attendant, while, pramugari, means, female, flight, attendant, another, example, is, olahragawan, which, means, sportsman, versus, olahragawati, meaning, sportswoman, often, words, like, these, or, certain, suffixes, such, as, a, and, i, or, wan, and, wati, are, absorbed, from, other, languages, in, these, cases, from, sanskrit, in, some, regions, of, indonesia, such, as, sumatra, and, jakarta, abang, a, gender, specific, term, meaning, older, brother, is, commonly, used, as, a, form, of, address, for, older, siblings, males, while, kakak, a, non, gender, specific, term, meaning, older, sibling, is, often, used, to, mean, older, sister, similarly, more, direct, influences, from, other, languages, such, as, javanese, and, chinese, have, also, seen, further, use, of, other, gendered, words, in, indonesian, for, example, mas, older, brother, mbak, older, sister, koko, older, brother, and, cici, older, sister, indonesian, grammar, does, not, regularly, mark, plurals, in, indonesian, to, change, a, singular, into, a, plural, one, either, repeats, the, word, or, adds, para, before, it, the, latter, for, living, things, only, for, example, students, can, be, either, murid, murid, or, para, murid, plurals, are, rarely, used, in, indonesian, especially, in, informal, parlance, reduplication, is, often, mentioned, as, the, formal, way, to, express, the, plural, form, of, nouns, in, indonesian, however, in, informal, daily, discourse, speakers, of, indonesian, usually, use, other, methods, to, indicate, the, concept, of, something, being, more, than, one, reduplication, may, also, indicate, the, conditions, of, variety, and, diversity, as, well, and, not, simply, plurality, reduplication, is, commonly, used, to, emphasise, plurality, however, reduplication, has, many, other, functions, for, example, orang, orang, means, all, the, people, but, orang, orangan, means, scarecrow, similarly, while, hati, means, heart, or, liver, hati, hati, is, a, verb, meaning, to, be, careful, also, not, all, reduplicated, words, are, inherently, plural, such, as, orang, orangan, scarecrow, scarecrows, biri, biri, a, some, sheep, and, kupu, kupu, butterfly, butterflies, some, reduplication, is, rhyming, rather, than, exact, as, in, sayur, mayur, all, sorts, of, vegetables, distributive, affixes, derive, mass, nouns, that, are, effectively, plural, pohon, tree, pepohonan, flora, trees, rumah, house, perumahan, housing, houses, gunung, mountain, pegunungan, mountain, range, mountains, quantity, words, come, before, the, noun, seribu, orang, a, thousand, people, beberapa, pegunungan, a, series, of, mountain, ranges, beberapa, kupu, kupu, some, butterflies, plural, in, indonesian, serves, just, to, explicitly, mention, the, number, of, objects, in, sentence, for, example, ani, membeli, satu, kilo, mangga, ani, buys, one, kilogram, of, mangoes, in, this, case, mangoes, which, is, plural, is, not, said, as, mangga, mangga, because, the, plurality, is, implicit, the, amount, a, kilogram, means, more, than, one, mango, rather, than, one, giant, mango, so, as, it, is, logically, one, does, not, change, the, singular, into, the, plural, form, because, it, is, not, necessary, and, considered, a, pleonasm, in, indonesian, often, called, pemborosan, kata, personal, pronouns, are, not, a, separate, part, of, speech, but, a, subset, of, nouns, they, are, frequently, omitted, and, there, are, numerous, ways, to, say, you, commonly, the, person, s, name, title, title, with, name, or, occupation, is, used, does, johnny, want, to, go, would, madam, like, to, go, kin, terms, including, fictive, kinship, are, extremely, common, however, there, are, also, dedicated, personal, pronouns, as, well, as, the, demonstrative, pronouns, ini, this, the, and, itu, that, the, from, the, perspective, of, a, european, language, indonesian, boasts, a, wide, range, of, different, pronouns, especially, to, refer, to, the, addressee, the, so, called, second, person, pronouns, these, are, used, to, differentiate, several, parameters, of, the, person, they, are, referred, to, such, as, the, social, rank, and, the, relationship, between, the, addressee, and, the, speaker, indonesian, also, exhibits, pronoun, avoidance, often, preferring, kinship, terms, and, titles, over, pronouns, particularly, for, respectful, forms, of, address, the, table, below, provides, an, overview, of, the, most, commonly, and, widely, used, pronouns, in, the, indonesian, language, notable, among, the, personal, pronoun, system, is, a, distinction, between, two, forms, of, we, kita, you, and, me, you, and, us, and, kami, us, but, not, you, the, distinction, is, not, always, followed, in, colloquial, indonesian, saya, and, aku,

one, a, saya, mau, yang, ini, a, i, would, like, this, one, a, yang, itu, a, that, one, verbs, are, not, inflected, for, person, or, number, and, they, are, not, marked, for, tense, tense, is, instead, denoted, by, time, adverbs, such, as, yesterday, or, by, other, tense, indicators, such, as, sudah, already, and, belum, not, yet, on, the, other, hand, there, is, a, complex, system, of, verb, affixes, to, render, nuances, of, meaning, and, to, denote, voice, or, intentional, and, accidental, moods, some, of, these, affixes, are, ignored, in, colloquial, speech, examples, of, these, are, the, prefixes, di, patient, focus, traditionally, called, passive, voice, with, ova, word, order, in, the, third, person, and, oav, in, the, first, or, second, persons, meng, agent, focus, traditionally, called, active, voice, with, avo, word, order, memper, and, diper, causative, agent, and, patient, focus, ber, stative, or, habitual, intransitive, vs, order, and, ter, agentless, actions, such, as, those, which, are, involuntary, sudden, stative, or, accidental, for, va, vo, order, the, suffixes, kan, causative, or, benefactive, and, i, locative, repetitive, or, exhaustive, and, the, circumfixes, ber, an, plural, subject, diffuse, action, and, ke, an, unintentional, or, potential, action, or, state, forms, in, ter, and, ke, an, are, often, equivalent, to, adjectives, in, english, four, words, are, used, for, negation, in, indonesian, namely, tidak, bukan, jangan, and, belum, for, example, for, negating, imperatives, or, advising, against, certain, actions, in, indonesian, the, word, jangan, do, not, is, used, before, the, verb, for, example, there, are, grammatical, adjectives, in, indonesian, stative, verbs, are, often, used, for, this, purpose, as, well, adjectives, are, always, placed, after, the, noun, that, they, modify, to, say, that, something, is, an, adjective, the, determiners, itu, and, ini, that, and, this, are, often, used, for, example, in, the, sentence, anjing, itu, galak, the, use, of, itu, gives, a, meaning, of, the, that, dog, is, ferocious, while, anjing, ini, galak, gives, a, meaning, of, this, dog, is, ferocious, however, if, itu, or, ini, were, not, to, be, used, then, anjing, galak, would, only, mean, ferocious, dog, a, plain, adjective, without, any, stative, implications, the, all, purpose, determiner, yang, is, also, often, used, before, adjectives, hence, anjing, yang, galak, also, means, ferocious, dog, or, more, literally, dog, which, is, ferocious, yang, will, often, be, used, for, clarity, hence, in, a, sentence, such, as, saya, didekati, oleh, anjing, galak, which, means, i, was, approached, by, a, ferocious, dog, the, use, of, the, adjective, galak, is, not, stative, at, all, often, the, ber, intransitive, verb, prefix, or, the, ter, stative, prefix, is, used, to, express, the, meaning, of, to, be, for, example, beda, means, different, hence, berbeda, means, to, be, different, awan, means, cloud, hence, berawan, means, cloudy, using, the, ter, prefix, implies, a, state, of, being, for, example, buka, means, open, hence, terbuka, means, is, opened, tutup, means, closed, shut, hence, tertutup, means, is, closed, shut, adjectives, demonstrative, determiners, and, possessive, determiners, follow, the, noun, they, modify, indonesian, does, not, have, a, grammatical, subject, in, the, sense, that, english, does, in, intransitive, clauses, the, noun, comes, before, the, verb, when, there, is, both, an, agent, and, an, object, these, are, separated, by, the, verb, ova, or, avo, with, the, difference, encoded, in, the, voice, of, the, verb, ova, commonly, but, inaccurately, called, passive, is, the, basic, and, most, common, word, order, either, the, agent, or, object, or, both, may, be, omitted, this, is, commonly, done, to, accomplish, one, of, two, things, for, example, a, polite, shop, assistant, in, a, store, may, avoid, the, use, of, pronouns, altogether, and, ask, for, example, a, friend, may, enquire, as, to, when, you, bought, your, property, to, which, you, may, respond, ultimately, the, choice, of, voice, and, therefore, word, order, is, a, choice, between, actor, and, patient, and, depends, quite, heavily, on, the, language, style, and, context, word, order, is, frequently, modified, for, focus, or, emphasis, with, the, focused, word, usually, placed, at, the, beginning, of, the, clause, and, followed, by, a, slight, pause, a, break, in, intonation, the, last, two, are, more, likely, to, be, encountered, in, speech, than, in, writing, another, distinguishing, feature, of, indonesian, is, its, use, of, measure, words, also, called, classifiers, kata, penggolong, in, this, way, it, is, similar, to, many, other, languages, of, asia, including, chinese, japanese, vietnamese, thai, burmese, and, bengali, measure, words, are, also, found, in, english, such, as, two, head, of, cattle, or, a, loaf, of, bread, where, two, cattle, and, a, bread, would, be, ungrammatical, the, word, satu, reduces, to, se, s, as, it, does, in, other, compounds, example, measure, words, are, not, necessary, just, to, say, a, burung, a, bird, birds, using, se, plus, a, measure, word, is, closer, to, english, one, or, a, certain, indonesian, is, written, with, the, latin, script, it, was, originally, based, on, the, dutch, spelling, and, still, bears, some, similarities, to, it, consonants, are, represented, in, a, way, similar, to, italian, although, c, is, always, t, like, english, ch, g, is, always, hard, and, j, represents, d, as, it, does, in, english, in, addition, ny, represents, the, palatal, nasal, ng, is, used, for, the, velar, nasal, which, can, occur, word, initially, sy, for, english, sh, and, kh, for, the, voiceless, velar,

system, named, from, the, advisor, of, the, system, charles, adriaan, van, ophuijsen, was, the, first, standardization, of, romanized, spelling, it, was, most, influenced, by, the, then, current, dutch, spelling, system, and, based, on, the, dialect, of, malay, spoken, in, johor, in, 1947, the, spelling, was, changed, into, republican, spelling, or, soewandi, spelling, named, by, at, the, time, minister, of, education, soewandi, this, spelling, changed, formerly, spelled, oe, into, u, however, the, spelling, influenced, other, aspects, in, orthography, for, example, writing, reduplicated, words, all, of, the, other, changes, were, a, part, of, the, perfected, spelling, system, an, officially, mandated, spelling, reform, in, 1972, some, of, the, old, spellings, which, were, derived, from, dutch, orthography, do, survive, in, proper, names, for, example, the, name, of, a, former, president, of, indonesia, is, still, sometimes, written, soeharto, and, the, central, java, city, of, yogyakarta, is, sometimes, written, jogjakarta, in, time, the, spelling, system, is, further, updated, and, the, latest, update, of, indonesian, spelling, system, issued, on, 16,

exceptions, the, letters, q, v, and, x, are, rarely, encountered, being, chiefly, used, for, writing, loanwords, in, addition, there, are, digraphs, that, are, not, considered, separate, letters, of, the, alphabet, pie, chart, showing, percentage, of, other, languages, contribute, on, loan, words, of, indonesian, language, as, a, modern, variety, of, malay, indonesian, has, been, influenced, by, other, languages, including, dutch, english, greek, where, the, name, of, the, country, indonesia, comes, from, arabic, chinese, portuguese, sanskrit, tamil, hindi, and, persian, the, vast, majority, of, indonesian, words, however, come, from, the, root, lexical, stock, of, austronesian, including, old, malay, the, study, of, indonesian, etymology, and, loan, words, reveals, both, its, historical, and, social, contexts, examples, are, the, early, sanskrit, borrowings, from, the, 7th, century, during, the, trading, era, the, borrowings, from, arabic, and, persian, during, the, time, of, the,

contacts, with, india, since, ancient, times, the, words, were, either, borrowed, directly, from, india, or, with, the, intermediary, of, the, old, javanese, language, although, hinduism, and, buddhism, are, no, longer, the, major, religions, of, indonesia, sanskrit, which, was, the, language, vehicle, for, these, religions, is, still, held, in, high, esteem, and, is, comparable, with, the, status, of, latin, in, english, and, other, western, european, languages, sanskrit, is, also, the, main, source, for, neologisms, which, are, usually, formed, from, sanskrit, roots, the, loanwords,

the, basic, vocabulary, of, indonesian, to, such, an, extent, that, for, many, they, are, no, longer, perceived, to, be, foreign, therefore, one, could, write, a, short, story, using, mostly, sanskrit, derived, words, the, short, story, below, consists, of, approximately, 80, words, in, indonesian, that, are, all, derived, from, sanskrit, as, well, as, a, few, native, function, words, and,
