nonverbal, communication, is, the, transmission, of, messages, or, signals, through, a, nonverbal, platform, such, as, eye, contact, oculesics, body, language, kinesics, social, distance, proxemics, touch, haptics, voice, paralanguage, physical, environments, appearance, and, use, of, objects, when, communicating, we, utilize, nonverbal, channels, as, means, to, convey, different, messages, or, signals, whereas, others, can, interpret, these, message, the, study, of, nonverbal, communication, started, in, 1872, with, the, publication, of, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, by, charles, darwin, darwin, began, to, study, nonverbal, communication, as, he, noticed, the, interactions, between, animals, such, as, lions, tigers, dogs, etc, and, realized, they, also, communicated, by, gestures, and, expressions, for, the, first, time, nonverbal, communication, was, studied, and, its, relevance, questioned, today, scholars, argue, that, nonverbal, communication, can, convey, more, meaning, than, verbal, communication, in, the, same, way, that, speech, incorporates, nonverbal, components, collectively, referred, to, as, paralanguage, and, encompassing, voice, quality, rate, pitch, loudness, and, speaking, style, nonverbal, communication, also, encompasses, facets, of, one, s, voice, elements, such, as, tone, inflection, emphasis, and, other, vocal, characteristics, contribute, significantly, to, nonverbal, communication, adding, layers, of, meaning, and, nuance, to, the, conveyed, message, however, much, of, the, study, of, nonverbal, communication, has, focused, on, interaction, between, individuals, where, it, can, be, classified, into, three, principal, areas, environmental, conditions, where, communication, takes, place, physical, characteristics, of, the, communicators, and, behaviors, of, communicators, during, interaction, nonverbal, communication, involves, the, conscious, and, unconscious, processes, of, encoding, and, decoding, encoding, is, defined, as, our, ability, to, express, emotions, in, a, way, that, can, be, accurately, interpreted, by, the, receiver, s, decoding, is, called, nonverbal, sensitivity, defined, as, the, ability, to, take, this, encoded, emotion, and, interpret, its, meanings, accurately, to, what, the, sender, intended, encoding, is, the, act, of, generating, information, such, as, facial, expressions, gestures, and, postures, encoding, information, utilizes, signals, which, we, may, think, to, be, universal, decoding, is, the, interpretation, of, information, from, received, sensations, given, by, the, encoder, culture, plays, an, important, role, in, nonverbal, communication, and, it, is, one, aspect, that, helps, to, influence, how, we, interact, with, each, other, in, many, indigenous, american, communities, nonverbal, cues, and, silence, hold, immense, importance, in, deciphering, the, meaning, of, messages, in, such, cultures, the, context, relationship, dynamics, and, subtle, nonverbal, cues, play, a, pivotal, role, in, communication, and, interpretation, impacting, how, learning, activities, are, organized, and, understood, according, to, some, authors, nonverbal, communication, represents, two, thirds, of, all, communications, nonverbal, communication, can, portray, a, message, both, vocally, and, with, the, correct, body, signals, or, gestures, body, signals, comprise, physical, features, conscious, and, unconscious, gestures, and, signals, and, the, mediation, of, personal, space, the, wrong, message, can, also, be, established, if, the, body, language, conveyed, does, not, match, a, verbal, message, paying, attention, to, both, verbal, and, nonverbal, communication, may, leave, the, listener, with, a, feeling, of, being, lost, due, to, not, being, able, to, breakdown, both, at, the, same, time, however, ignoring, nonverbal, communication, altogether, would, cause, the, listener, to, miss, up, to, 60, of, their, communication, according, to, experts, nonverbal, communication, strengthens, a, first, impression, in, common, situations, like, attracting, a, partner, or, in, a, business, interview, impressions, are, on, average, formed, within, the, first, four, seconds, of, contact, first, encounters, or, interactions, with, another, person, strongly, affect, a, person, s, perception, when, the, other, person, or, group, is, absorbing, the, message, they, are, focused, on, the, entire, environment, around, them, meaning, the, other, person, uses, all, five, senses, in, the, interaction, 83, sight, 11, hearing, 3, smell, 2, touch, and, 1, taste, many, indigenous, cultures, use, nonverbal, communication, in, the, integration, of, children, at, a, young, age, into, their, cultural, practices, children, in, these, communities, learn, through, observing, and, pitching, in, through, which, nonverbal, communication, is, a, key, aspect, of, observation, according, to, judee, k, burgoon, et, al, further, reasons, for, the, importance, of, non, verbal, communication, are, nonverbal, communication, encompasses, a, diverse, range, of, signals, that, go, beyond, spoken, language, such, as, gestures, facial, expressions, body, language, and, vocal, nuances, like, tone, and, rhythm, these, cues, carry, subtle, meanings, critical, to, effective, communication, for, example, facial, expressions, are, a, powerful, medium, for, conveying, emotions, sometimes, even, through, subtle, microexpressions, these, microexpressions, are, fleeting, involuntary, facial, movements, that, briefly, reveal, genuine, feeling, they, often, occur, in, a, fraction, of, a, second, offering, a, brief, insight, into, a, person, s, genuine, emotions, some, of, which, may, not, be, intentionally, expressed, and, may, diverge, from, their, consciously, stated, feelings, while, some, cues, might, be, universally, understood, others, hold, culture, specific, significance, necessitating, careful, interpretation, to, prevent, misunderstandings, understanding, the, tone, pitch, cultural, connotations, of, touch, and, environmental, influences, enriches, nonverbal, communication, shaping, our, interactions, recognizing, that, cultural, norms, influence, the, appropriateness, of, tone, and, pitch, is, crucial, as, outlined, by, display, rules, this, underscores, the, significance, of, being, culturally, sensitive, when, interpreting, nonverbal, cues, in, the, context, of, intercultural, communication, a, deeper, understanding, of, context, culture, becomes, essential, context, culture, significantly, shapes, how, individuals, communicate, emotions, and, convey, meaning, through, nonverbal, signals, being, aware, of, these, cultural, nuances, is, fundamental, for, facilitating, successful, cross, cultural, interactions, and, ensuring, the, accurate, interpretation, of, nonverbal, expressions, the, understanding, of, tone, pitch, and, cultural, contexts, in, verbal, communication, complements, nonverbal, cues, offering, a, holistic, grasp, of, interpersonal, dynamics, the, harmony, or, discrepancy, between, verbal, and, nonverbal, signals, significantly, impacts, message, clarity, in, cultures, where, nonverbal, cues, are, pivotal, incongruence, between, verbal, and, nonverbal, elements, can, create, confusion, while, in, cultures, emphasizing, explicit, verbal, communication, alignment, between, the, two, is, essential, for, effective, understanding, mastery, of, nonverbal, signals, extends, beyond, mere, word, comprehension, promoting, cultural, awareness, and, smoother, interactions, across, diverse, settings, proficiency, in, interpreting, these, cues, not, only, aids, in, accurate, understanding, but, also, bolsters, cross, cultural, connections, enabling, more, profound, exchanges, adeptness, in, nonverbal, communication, is, crucial, for, navigating, social, situations, decoding, nuanced, human, behaviors, and, establishing, meaningful, connections, in, various, contexts, underlining, the, interconnectedness, and, importance, of, both, verbal, and, nonverbal, forms, of, communication, scientific, research, on, nonverbal, communication, and, behavior, was, started, in, 1872, with, the, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, book, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, in, the, book, darwin, argued, that, all, mammals, both, humans, and, animals, showed, emotion, through, facial, expressions, he, posed, questions, such, as, why, do, our, facial, expressions, of, emotions, take, the, particular, forms, they, do, and, why, do, we, wrinkle, our, nose, when, we, are, disgusted, and, bare, our, teeth, when, we, are, enraged, darwin, attributed, these, facial, expressions, to, serviceable, associated, habits, which, are, behaviors, that, earlier, in, our, evolutionary, history, had, specific, and, direct, functions, for, example, a, species, that, attacked, by, biting, baring, the, teeth, was, a, necessary, act, before, an, assault, and, wrinkling, the, nose, reduced, the, inhalation, of, foul, odors, in, response, to, the, question, asking, why, facial, expressions, persist, even, when, they, no, longer, serve, their, original, purposes, darwin, s, predecessors, have, developed, a, highly, valued, explanation, according, to, darwin, humans, continue, to, make, facial, expressions, because, they, have, acquired, communicative, value, throughout, evolutionary, history, in, other, words, humans, utilize, facial, expressions, as, external, evidence, of, their, internal, state, although, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, was, not, one, of, darwin, s, most, successful, books, in, terms, of, its, quality, and, overall, impact, in, the, field, his, initial, ideas, started, the, abundance, of, research, on, the, types, effects, and, expressions, of, nonverbal, communication, and, behavior, despite, the, introduction, of, nonverbal, communication, in, the, 1800s, the, emergence, of, behaviorism, in, the, 1920s, paused, further, research, on, nonverbal, communication, behaviorism, is, defined, as, the, theory, of, learning, that, describes, people, s, behavior, as, acquired, through, conditioning, behaviorists, such, as, b, f, skinner, trained, pigeons, to, engage, in, various, behaviors, to, demonstrate, how, animals, engage, in, behaviors, with, rewards, while, most, psychology, researchers, were, exploring, behaviorism, the, study, of, nonverbal, communication, as, recorded, on, film, began, in, 1955, 56, at, the, center, for, advanced, study, in, behavioral, sciences, through, a, project, which, came, to, be, called, the, natural, history, of, an, interview, the, initial, participants, included, two, psychiatrists, frieda, fromm, reichman, and, henry, brosin, two, linguists, norman, a, mcquown, and, charles, hockett, and, also, two, anthropologists, clyde, kluckhohn, and, david, m, schneider, these, last, two, withdrew, by, the, end, of, 1955, and, did, not, participate, in, the, major, group, project, in, their, place, two, other, anthropologists, ray, birdwhistell, already, then, known, as, the, founder, of, kinesics, the, study, of, body, motion, communication, and, gregory, bateson, known, more, generally, as, a, human, communication, theorist, both, joined, the, team, in, 1956, albert, scheflen, and, adam, kendon, were, among, those, who, joined, one, of, the, small, research, teams, continuing, research, once, the, year, at, casbs, ended, the, project, analyzed, a, film, made, by, bateson, using, an, analytic, method, called, at, the, time, natural, history, and, later, mostly, by, scheflen, context, analysis, the, result, remained, unpublished, as, it, was, enormous, and, unwieldy, but, it, was, available, on, microfilm, by, 1971, the, method, involves, transcribing, filmed, or, videotaped, behavior, in, excruciating, detail, and, was, later, used, in, studying, the, sequence, and, structure, of, human, greetings, social, behaviors, at, parties, and, the, function, of, posture, during, interpersonal, interaction, research, on, nonverbal, communication, rocketed, during, the, mid, 1960s, by, a, number, of, psychologists, and, researchers, michael, argyle, and, janet, dean, fodor, for, example, studied, the, relationship, between, eye, contact, and, conversational, distance, ralph, v, exline, examined, patterns, of, looking, while, speaking, and, looking, while, listening, eckhard, hess, produced, several, studies, pertaining, to, pupil, dilation, that, were, published, in, scientific, american, robert, sommer, studied, the, relationship, between, personal, space, and, the, environment, robert, rosenthal, discovered, that, expectations, made, by, teachers, and, researchers, can, influence, their, outcomes, and, that, subtle, nonverbal, cues, may, play, an, important, role, in, this, process, albert, mehrabian, studied, the, nonverbal, cues, of, liking, and, immediacy, by, the, 1970s, a, number, of, scholarly, volumes, in, psychology, summarized, the, growing, body, of, research, such, as, shirley, weitz, s, nonverbal, communication, and, marianne, lafrance, and, clara, mayo, s, moving, bodies, popular, books, included, body, language, fast, 1970, which, focused, on, how, to, use, nonverbal, communication, to, attract, other, people, and, how, to, read, a, person, like, a, book, nierenberg, calero, 1971, which, examined, nonverbal, behavior, in, negotiation, situations, the, journal, environmental, psychology, and, nonverbal, behavior, was, founded, in, 1976, in, 1970, argyle, hypothesized, that, although, spoken, language, is, used, for, communicating, the, meaning, about, events, external, to, the, person, communicating, the, nonverbal, codes, are, used, to, create, and, strengthen, interpersonal, relationships, when, someone, wishes, to, avoid, conflicting, or, embarrassing, events, during, communication, it, is, considered, proper, and, correct, by, the, hypothesis, to, communicate, attitudes, towards, others, non, verbally, instead, of, verbally, along, with, this, philosophy, michael, argyle, also, found, and, concluded, in, 1988, that, there, are, five, main, functions, of, nonverbal, body, behavior, and, gestures, in, human, communications, self, presentation, of, one, s, whole, personality, rituals, and, cultural, greetings, expressing, interpersonal, attitudes, expressing, emotions, and, to, accompany, speech, in, managing, the, cues, set, in, the, interactions, between, the, speaker, and, the, listener, it, takes, just, one, tenth, of, a, second, for, someone, to, judge, and, make, their, first, impression, according, to, a, study, from, princeton, university, this, short, amount, of, time, is, enough, for, a, person, to, determine, several, attributes, about, an, individual, these, attributes, included, attractiveness, likeability, trustworthiness, competence, and, aggressiveness, a, first, impression, is, a, lasting, non, verbal, communicator, the, way, a, person, portrays, themselves, on, the, first, encounter, is, non, verbal, statement, to, the, observer, presentation, can, include, clothing, and, other, visible, attributes, such, as, facial, expressions, or, facial, traits, in, general, negative, impressions, can, also, be, based, on, presentation, and, on, personal, prejudice, first, impressions, although, sometimes, misleading, can, in, many, situations, be, an, accurate, depiction, of, others, in, terms, of, culture, collectivists, have, a, harder, time, changing, their, first, impressions, because, they, emphasize, a, lot, more, context, and, need, additional, time, when, faced, with, new, clues, as, each, view, may, be, correct, in, some, contexts, moreover, fang, et, al, acknowledged, that, first, impression, is, less, likely, to, change, in, asian, culture, because, they, value, cohesiveness, and, consensus, thus, will, not, destroy, their, group, cohesiveness, at, the, expense, of, changing, their, first, impression, when, they, reached, a, consensus, posture, is, a, nonverbal, cue, that, is, associated, with, positioning, and, that, these, two, are, used, as, sources, of, information, about, individual, s, characteristics, attitudes, and, feelings, about, themselves, and, other, people, there, are, many, different, types, of, body, positioning, to, portray, certain, postures, including, slouching, towering, legs, spread, jaw, thrust, shoulders, forward, and, arm, crossing, the, posture, or, bodily, stance, exhibited, by, individuals, communicates, a, variety, of, messages, whether, good, or, bad, a, study, for, instance, identified, around, 200, postures, that, are, related, to, maladjustment, and, withholding, of, information, posture, can, be, used, to, determine, a, participant, s, degree, of, attention, or, involvement, the, difference, in, status, between, communicators, and, the, level, of, fondness, a, person, has, for, the, other, communicator, depending, on, body, openness, 9, it, can, also, be, effectively, used, as, a, way, for, an, individual, to, convey, a, desire, to, increase, limit, or, avoid, interaction, with, another, person, studies, investigating, the, impact, of, posture, on, interpersonal, relationships, suggest, that, mirror, image, congruent, postures, where, one, person, s, left, side, is, parallel, to, the, other, person, s, right, side, leads, to, favorable, perception, of, communicators, and, positive, speech, a, person, who, displays, a, forward, lean, or, decreases, a, backward, lean, also, signifies, positive, sentiment, during, communication, posture, can, be, situation, relative, that, is, people, will, change, their, posture, depending, on, the, situation, they, are, in, this, can, be, demonstrated, in, the, case, of, relaxed, posture, when, an, individual, is, within, a, nonthreatening, situation, and, the, way, one, s, body, tightens, or, become, rigid, when, under, stress, clothing, is, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, non, verbal, communication, the, study, of, clothing, and, other, objects, as, a, means, of, non, verbal, communication, is, known, as, artifactics, or, objectics, the, types, of, clothing, that, an, individual, wears, convey, nonverbal, cues, about, their, personality, background, and, financial, status, and, how, others, will, respond, to, them, an, individual, s, clothing, style, can, demonstrate, their, culture, mood, level, of, confidence, interests, age, authority, and, values, beliefs, for, instance, jewish, men, may, wear, a, yarmulke, to, outwardly, communicate, their, religious, belief, similarly, clothing, can, communicate, what, nationality, a, person, or, group, is, for, example, in, traditional, festivities, scottish, men, often, wear, kilts, to, specify, their, culture, aside, from, communicating, a, person, s, beliefs, and, nationality, clothing, can, be, used, as, a, nonverbal, cue, to, attract, others, men, and, women, may, shower, themselves, with, accessories, and, high, end, fashion, to, attract, partners, interested, in, this, case, clothing, is, a, form, of, self, expression, where, people, can, flaunt, their, power, wealth, sex, appeal, or, creativity, a, study, of, the, clothing, worn, by, women, attending, discoth, ques, carried, out, in, vienna, austria, it, showed, that, in, certain, groups, of, women, especially, women, who, were, without, their, partners, motivation, for, sex, and, levels, of, sexual, hormones, were, correlated, with, aspects, of, their, clothing, especially, the, amount, of, skin, displayed, and, the, presence, of, sheer, clothing, the, way, one, chooses, to, dress, tells, a, lot, about, one, s, personality, the, university, of, north, carolina, studied, how, undergraduate, women, chose, to, dress, and, their, personality, types, the, study, showed, that, women, dressed, primarily, for, comfort, and, practicality, were, more, self, controlled, dependable, and, socially, well, adjusted, women, who, did, not, like, to, stand, out, in, a, crowd, typically, had, more, conservative, and, traditional, views, and, beliefs, clothing, although, non, verbal, tells, people, what, the, individual, s, personality, is, the, way, a, person, dresses, is, typically, rooted, in, deeper, internal, motivations, such, as, emotions, experiences, and, culture, clothing, expresses, who, they, are, or, who, they, want, to, be, that, day, it, shows, other, people, who, they, want, to, be, associated, with, and, where, they, fit, in, clothing, can, start, relationships, because, they, clue, other, people, into, the, wearer, when, it, comes, to, the, clothing, that, they, wear, nonverbal, communication, with, gangs, is, very, common, gang, members, typically, wear, 2, 3, colors, to, signify, that, they, are, representing, a, particular, neighborhood, baseball, caps, and, hats, with, specific, gang, names, and, initials, worn, backwards, tilted, in, certain, colors, etc, bandanas, worn, around, the, head, shoulders, arms, or, legs, gang, members, frequently, dress, in, hip, hop, inspired, fashions, such, as, oversized, pants, worn, below, the, waist, also, known, as, sagging, colored, belts, colored, shoes, and, colored, bandanas, are, all, utilized, as, identifiers, group, colors, and, clothing, are, commonly, used, to, represent, affiliation, gestures, may, be, made, with, the, hands, arms, or, body, and, also, include, movements, of, the, head, face, and, eyes, such, as, winking, nodding, or, rolling, one, s, eyes, although, the, study, of, gesture, is, still, in, its, infancy, some, broad, categories, of, gestures, have, been, identified, by, researchers, the, most, familiar, are, the, so, called, emblems, or, quotable, gestures, these, are, conventional, culture, specific, gestures, that, can, be, used, as, replacement, for, words, such, as, the, hand, wave, used, in, western, cultures, for, hello, and, goodbye, a, single, emblematic, gesture, can, have, a, very, different, significance, in, different, cultural, contexts, ranging, from, complimentary, to, highly, offensive, for, a, list, of, emblematic, gestures, see, list, of, gestures, there, are, some, universal, gestures, like, the, shoulder, shrug, gestures, can, also, be, categorized, as, either, speech, independent, or, speech, related, speech, independent, gestures, are, dependent, upon, culturally, accepted, interpretation, and, have, a, direct, verbal, translation, 9, a, wave, or, a, peace, sign, are, examples, of, speech, independent, gestures, speech, related, gestures, are, used, in, parallel, with, verbal, speech, this, form, of, nonverbal, communication, is, used, to, emphasize, the, message, that, is, being, communicated, speech, related, gestures, are, intended, to, provide, supplemental, information, to, a, verbal, message, such, as, pointing, to, an, object, of, discussion, facial, expressions, more, than, anything, serve, as, a, practical, means, of, communication, with, all, the, various, muscles, that, precisely, control, mouth, lips, eyes, nose, forehead, and, jaw, human, faces, are, estimated, to, be, capable, of, more, than, ten, thousand, different, expressions, this, versatility, makes, non, verbals, of, the, face, extremely, efficient, and, honest, unless, deliberately, manipulated, in, addition, many, of, these, emotions, including, happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, shame, anguish, and, interest, are, universally, recognized, displays, of, emotions, can, generally, be, categorized, into, two, groups, negative, and, positive, negative, emotions, usually, manifest, as, increased, tension, in, various, muscle, groups, tightening, of, jaw, muscles, furrowing, of, forehead, squinting, eyes, or, lip, occlusion, when, the, lips, seemingly, disappear, in, contrast, positive, emotions, are, revealed, by, the, loosening, of, the, furrowed, lines, on, the, forehead, relaxation, of, the, muscles, around, the, mouth, and, widening, of, the, eye, area, when, individuals, are, truly, relaxed, and, at, ease, the, head, will, also, tilt, to, the, side, exposing, our, most, vulnerable, area, the, neck, this, is, a, high, comfort, display, often, seen, during, courtship, that, is, nearly, impossible, to, mimic, when, tense, or, suspicious, gestures, can, be, subdivided, into, three, groups, some, hand, movements, are, not, considered, to, be, gestures, they, consist, of, manipulations, either, of, the, person, or, some, object, e, g, clothing, pencils, eyeglasses, the, kinds, of, scratching, fidgeting, rubbing, tapping, and, touching, that, people, often, do, with, their, hands, these, behaviors, can, show, that, a, person, is, experiencing, anxiety, or, feeling, of, discomfort, typical, when, the, individual, is, not, the, one, in, control, of, the, conversation, or, situation, and, therefore, expresses, this, uneasiness, subconsciously, such, behaviors, are, referred, to, as, adapters, they, may, not, be, perceived, as, meaningfully, related, to, the, speech, in, which, they, accompany, but, may, serve, as, the, basis, for, dispositional, inferences, of, the, speaker, s, emotion, nervous, uncomfortable, bored, these, types, of, movements, are, believed, to, express, the, unconscious, thoughts, and, feelings, of, a, person, or, those, thoughts, and, emotions, one, is, trying, to, consciously, hide, other, hand, movements, are, gestures, they, are, movements, with, specific, conventionalized, meanings, called, symbolic, gestures, they, are, the, exact, opposite, of, adaptors, since, their, meanings, are, intended, to, be, communicated, and, they, have, a, specific, meaning, for, the, person, who, gives, the, gesture, and, the, person, to, receive, it, familiar, symbolic, gestures, include, the, raised, fist, bye, bye, and, thumbs, up, in, contrast, to, adapters, symbolic, gestures, are, used, intentionally, and, serve, a, clear, communicative, function, sign, languages, are, highly, developed, systems, of, symbolic, gesture, some, educators, that, work, with, deaf, learners, use, a, combination, of, cued, speech, and, lip, speaking, and, reading, that, helps, deaf, and, hard, hearing, individuals, d, hh, to, code, and, decode, words, based, on, their, phonetics, in, addition, to, the, supplementary, aspect, of, the, cues, like, location, and, movement, every, culture, has, their, own, set, of, gestures, some, of, which, are, unique, only, to, a, specific, culture, for, example, the, phonological, and, lexical, repository, of, d, hh, individuals, is, highly, dependent, on, their, social, background, and, richness, of, language, very, similar, gestures, can, have, very, different, meanings, across, cultures, symbolic, gestures, are, usually, used, in, the, absence, of, speech, but, can, also, accompany, speech, the, middle, ground, between, adapters, and, symbolic, gestures, is, occupied, by, conversational, gestures, these, gestures, do, not, refer, to, actions, or, words, but, do, accompany, speech, conversational, gestures, are, hand, movements, that, accompany, speech, and, are, related, to, the, speech, they, accompany, though, they, do, accompany, speech, conversational, gestures, are, not, seen, in, the, absence, of, speech, and, are, only, made, by, the, person, who, is, speaking, there, are, a, few, types, of, conversational, gestures, specifically, motor, and, lexical, movements, motor, movements, are, those, which, are, rhythmical, and, repetitive, do, not, have, to, be, accompanied, by, anything, spoken, due, to, their, simple, meaning, and, the, speaker, s, hand, usually, sticks, to, one, position, when, paired, with, verbal, communication, they, can, be, used, to, stress, certain, syllables, an, example, of, this, would, be, pointing, someone, in, the, direction, of, an, individual, and, saying, that, way, in, this, case, the, that, in, the, sentence, would, be, stressed, by, the, movements, lexical, movements, are, more, complex, not, rhythmic, or, repetitive, but, rather, lengthy, and, varied, an, example, of, this, would, be, something, like, giving, elaborate, directions, to, somewhere, and, pairing, that, with, various, hands, movements, to, signal, the, various, turns, to, take, according, to, edward, t, hall, the, amount, of, space, we, maintain, between, ourselves, and, the, persons, with, whom, we, are, communicating, shows, the, importance, of, the, science, of, proxemics, in, this, process, it, is, seen, how, we, feel, towards, the, others, at, that, particular, time, within, american, culture, hall, defines, four, primary, distance, zones, i, intimate, touching, to, eighteen, inches, distance, ii, personal, eighteen, inches, to, four, feet, distance, iii, social, four, to, twelve, feet, distance, and, iv, public, more, than, twelve, feet, distance, intimate, distance, is, considered, appropriate, for, familiar, relationships, and, indicates, closeness, and, trust, personal, distance, is, still, close, but, keeps, another, at, arm, s, length, and, is, considered, the, most, comfortable, distance, for, most, of, our, interpersonal, contact, while, social, distance, is, used, for, the, kind, of, communication, that, occurs, in, business, relationships, and, sometimes, in, the, classroom, public, distance, occurs, in, situations, where, two, way, communication, is, not, desirable, or, possible, eye, contact, is, the, instance, when, two, people, look, at, each, other, s, eyes, at, the, same, time, it, is, the, primary, nonverbal, way, of, indicating, engagement, interest, attention, and, involvement, nonverbal, communication, involves, the, conscious, and, unconscious, processes, of, encoding, and, decoding, encoding, is, defined, as, our, ability, to, express, emotions, in, a, way, that, the, receiver, s, decoding, is, called, nonverbal, sensitivity, defined, as, the, ability, to, take, this, encoded, emotion, and, interpret, its, meanings, accurately, to, what, the, sender, intended, encoding, is, the, act, of, generating, information, such, as, facial, expressions, gestures, and, postures, some, studies, have, demonstrated, that, people, use, their, eyes, to, indicate, interest, this, includes, frequently, recognized, actions, of, winking, and, movements, of, the, eyebrows, disinterest, is, highly, noticeable, when, little, or, no, eye, contact, is, made, in, a, social, setting, when, an, individual, is, interested, however, the, pupils, will, dilate, according, to, eckman, eye, contact, also, called, mutual, gaze, is, another, major, channel, of, nonverbal, communication, the, duration, of, eye, contact, is, its, most, meaningful, aspect, generally, speaking, the, longer, there, is, established, eye, contact, between, two, people, the, greater, the, intimacy, levels, gaze, comprises, the, actions, of, looking, while, talking, and, listening, the, length, of, a, gaze, the, frequency, of, glances, patterns, of, fixation, pupil, dilation, and, blink, rate, are, all, important, cues, in, nonverbal, communication, according, to, descroix, et, al, the, context, of, conversations, does, not, produce, long, blinks, between, the, emitter, and, the, recipient, liking, generally, increases, as, mutual, gazing, increases, along, with, the, detection, of, disinterest, deceit, can, also, be, observed, in, a, person, hogan, states, when, someone, is, being, deceptive, their, eyes, tend, to, blink, a, lot, more, eyes, act, as, leading, indicator, of, truth, or, deception, both, nonverbal, and, verbal, cues, are, useful, when, detecting, deception, it, is, typical, for, people, who, are, detecting, lies, to, rely, consistently, on, verbal, cues, but, this, can, hinder, how, well, they, detect, deception, those, who, are, lying, and, those, who, are, telling, the, truth, possess, different, forms, of, nonverbal, and, verbal, cues, and, this, is, important, to, keep, in, mind, in, addition, it, is, important, to, note, that, understanding, the, cultural, background, of, a, person, will, influence, how, easily, deception, is, detectable, because, nonverbal, cues, may, differ, depending, on, the, culture, in, addition, to, eye, contact, these, nonverbal, cues, can, consist, of, physiological, aspects, including, pulse, rate, as, well, as, levels, of, perspiration, in, addition, eye, aversion, can, be, predictive, of, deception, eye, aversion, is, the, avoidance, of, eye, contact, eye, contact, and, facial, expressions, provide, important, social, and, emotional, information, overall, as, pease, states, give, the, amount, of, eye, contact, that, makes, everyone, feel, comfortable, unless, looking, at, others, is, a, cultural, no, no, lookers, gain, more, credibility, than, non, lookers, in, concealing, deception, nonverbal, communication, makes, it, easier, to, lie, without, being, revealed, this, is, the, conclusion, of, a, study, where, people, watched, made, up, interviews, of, persons, accused, of, having, stolen, a, wallet, the, interviewees, lied, in, about, 50, of, the, cases, people, had, access, to, either, written, transcript, of, the, interviews, or, audio, tape, recordings, or, video, recordings, the, more, clues, that, were, available, to, those, watching, the, larger, was, the, trend, that, interviewees, who, actually, lied, were, judged, to, be, truthful, that, is, people, that, are, clever, at, lying, can, use, tone, of, voice, and, facial, expressions, to, give, the, impression, that, they, are, truthful, contrary, to, popular, belief, a, liar, does, not, always, avoid, eye, contact, in, an, attempt, to, be, more, convincing, liars, deliberately, made, more, eye, contact, with, interviewers, than, those, that, were, telling, the, truth, however, there, are, many, cited, examples, of, cues, to, deceit, delivered, via, nonverbal, paraverbal, and, visual, communication, channels, through, which, deceivers, supposedly, unwittingly, provide, clues, to, their, concealed, knowledge, or, actual, opinions, most, studies, examining, the, nonverbal, cues, to, deceit, rely, upon, human, coding, of, video, footage, c, f, vrij, 2008, although, a, recent, study, also, demonstrated, bodily, movement, differences, between, truth, tellers, and, liars, using, an, automated, body, motion, capture, system, olfactic, communication, is, a, channel, of, nonverbal, communication, referring, to, the, various, ways, people, and, animals, communicate, and, engage, in, social, interaction, through, their, sense, of, smell, our, human, olfactory, sense, is, one, of, the, most, phylogenetically, primitive, and, emotionally, intimate, of, the, five, senses, the, sensation, of, smell, is, thought, to, be, the, most, matured, and, developed, human, sense, while, it, may, seem, contradictory, vocalics, plays, a, very, important, part, in, nonverbal, communication, things, like, tempo, volume, inflection, pauses, and, pitch, all, communicate, emotion, and, attitude, without, using, specific, words, vocalics, also, have, emblems, or, sounds, with, clear, meaning, like, saying, burr, when, you, are, cold, or, hmm, when, you, are, thinking, about, something, these, are, not, specific, words, but, noises, that, further, convey, a, person, s, message, these, sounds, are, often, accompanied, by, another, nonverbal, cue, infants, heavily, rely, on, nonverbal, vocalics, to, communicate, their, needs, as, caregivers, talk, with, their, baby, the, baby, can, pick, up, intonation, as, well, start, to, mimic, and, use, it, themselves, as, they, go, on, babies, can, pick, up, more, and, learn, how, to, develop, their, own, voices, and, vocalics, furthermore, in, a, study, highlighted, by, pearce, and, conklin, they, found, that, changing, the, vocalics, of, an, audio, recording, of, the, same, speech, gave, different, results, of, liking, when, the, speaker, gave, his, speech, as, more, conversational, instead, of, dynamic, he, was, deemed, more, trust, worthy, vocalics, can, heavily, influence, communication, through, its, many, different, cues, while, not, traditionally, thought, of, as, talk, nonverbal, communication, has, been, found, to, contain, highly, precise, and, symbolic, meanings, similar, to, verbal, speech, however, the, meanings, in, nonverbal, communication, are, conveyed, through, the, use, of, gesture, posture, changes, and, timing, nuances, across, different, aspects, of, nonverbal, communication, can, be, found, in, cultures, all, around, the, world, these, differences, can, often, lead, to, miscommunication, between, people, of, different, cultures, who, usually, do, not, mean, to, offend, differences, can, be, based, in, preferences, for, mode, of, communication, like, the, chinese, who, prefer, silence, over, verbal, communication, 69, differences, can, even, be, based, on, how, cultures, perceive, the, passage, of, time, chronemics, how, people, handle, time, can, be, categorized, in, two, ways, polychronic, which, is, when, people, do, many, activities, at, once, and, is, common, in, italy, and, spain, or, monochronic, which, is, when, people, do, one, thing, at, a, time, which, is, common, in, america, 422, because, nonverbal, communication, can, vary, across, many, axes, gestures, gaze, clothing, posture, direction, or, even, environmental, cues, like, lighting, there, is, a, lot, of, room, for, cultural, differences, 8, in, japan, a, country, which, prides, itself, on, the, best, customer, service, workers, tend, to, use, wide, arm, gestures, to, give, clear, directions, to, strangers, accompanied, by, the, ever, present, bow, to, indicate, respect, one, of, the, main, factors, that, differentiates, nonverbal, communication, in, cultures, is, high, and, low, context, context, relates, to, certain, events, and, the, meaning, that, is, ultimately, derived, from, it, high, context, cultures, rely, mostly, on, nonverbal, cues, and, gestures, using, elements, such, as, the, closeness, of, the, kind, of, the, relationships, they, have, with, others, strict, social, hierarchies, and, classes, and, deep, cultural, tradition, and, widely, known, beliefs, and, rules, in, contrast, low, context, cultures, depend, largely, on, words, and, verbal, communication, where, communications, are, direct, and, social, hierarchies, are, way, less, tense, and, more, loose, gestures, vary, widely, across, cultures, in, how, they, are, used, and, what, they, mean, a, common, example, is, pointing, in, the, united, states, pointing, is, the, gesture, of, a, finger, or, hand, to, indicate, or, come, here, please, when, beckoning, a, dog, but, pointing, with, one, finger, is, also, considered, to, be, rude, by, some, cultures, those, from, asian, cultures, typically, use, their, entire, hand, to, point, to, something, other, examples, include, sticking, your, tongue, out, in, western, countries, it, can, be, seen, as, mockery, but, in, polynesia, it, serves, as, a, greeting, and, a, sign, of, reverence, 417, clapping, is, a, north, american, way, of, applauding, but, in, spain, is, used, to, summon, a, waiter, at, a, restaurant, differences, in, nodding, and, shaking, the, head, to, indicate, agreement, and, disagreement, also, exist, northern, europeans, nodding, their, heads, up, and, down, to, say, yes, and, shaking, their, head, from, side, to, side, to, say, no, but, the, greeks, have, for, at, least, three, thousand, years, used, the, upward, nod, for, disagreement, and, the, downward, nod, for, agreement, 417, there, are, many, ways, of, waving, goodbye, americans, face, the, palm, outward, and, move, the, hand, side, to, side, italians, face, the, palm, inward, and, move, the, fingers, facing, the, other, person, french, and, germans, face, the, hand, horizontal, and, move, the, fingers, toward, the, person, leaving, 417, also, it, is, important, to, note, that, gestures, are, used, in, more, informal, settings, and, more, often, by, children, 417, people, in, the, united, states, commonly, use, the, ok, hand, gesture, to, give, permission, and, allow, an, action, in, japan, however, the, same, sign, means, money, it, refers, to, zero, or, nothing, in, several, cultures, besides, these, two, argentina, belgium, french, and, the, portuguese, to, eastern, european, cultures, that, same, ok, sign, is, considered, a, vulgar, swearing, gesture, in, certain, commonwealth, cultures, the, index, and, middle, fingers, only, extended, with, the, palm, pointing, outwards, can, be, an, insulting, gesture, while, in, others, it, simply, means, the, number, two, or, the, v, for, victory, sign, while, the, same, sign, with, the, palm, pointing, inwards, means, peace, in, some, cultures, speech, independent, gestures, are, nonverbal, cues, that, communicate, a, word, or, an, expression, most, commonly, a, dictionary, definition, although, there, is, differences, in, nonverbal, gestures, across, cultures, speech, independent, gestures, must, have, an, agreeable, understanding, among, people, affiliated, with, that, culture, or, subculture, on, what, that, gesture, s, interpretation, is, as, most, humans, use, gestures, to, better, clarify, their, speech, speech, independent, gestures, do, not, rely, on, speech, for, their, meaning, usually, they, transpire, into, a, single, gesture, many, speech, independent, gestures, are, made, with, the, hand, the, ring, gesture, usually, comes, across, as, asking, someone, if, they, are, okay, there, are, several, that, could, be, performed, through, the, face, for, example, a, nose, wrinkle, could, universally, mean, disapproval, or, disgust, nodding, your, head, up, and, down, or, side, to, side, indicate, an, understanding, or, lack, of, when, the, speaker, is, talking, just, because, speech, independent, speech, does, not, need, actual, speech, for, understanding, the, gesture, it, still, needs, context, using, your, middle, finger, is, a, gesture, that, could, be, used, within, different, contexts, it, could, be, comical, or, derogatory, the, only, way, to, know, is, if, one, analyzes, the, other, behaviors, surrounding, it, and, depending, on, who, the, speaker, is, and, who, the, speaker, is, addressing, emotions, are, a, key, factor, in, nonverbal, communication, just, as, gestures, and, other, hand, movements, vary, across, cultures, so, does, the, way, people, display, their, emotions, for, example, in, many, cultures, such, as, the, arab, and, iranian, cultures, people, express, grief, openly, they, mourn, out, loud, while, in, asian, cultures, the, general, belief, is, that, it, is, unacceptable, to, show, emotion, openly, for, people, in, westernized, countries, laughter, is, a, sign, of, amusement, but, in, some, parts, of, africa, it, is, a, sign, of, wonder, or, embarrassment, 417, emotional, expression, varies, with, culture, native, americans, tend, to, be, more, reserved, and, less, expressive, with, emotions, 44, frequent, touches, are, common, for, chinese, people, however, such, actions, like, touching, patting, hugging, or, kissing, in, america, are, less, frequent, and, not, often, publicly, displayed, 68, according, to, rebecca, bernstein, from, point, park, university, winking, is, a, facial, expression, particularly, varied, in, meaning, according, to, latin, culture, a, wink, was, a, display, or, invitation, of, romantic, pursuit, the, yoruba, nigeria, have, taught, their, children, to, follow, certain, nonverbal, commands, such, as, winking, which, tells, them, it, is, time, to, leave, the, room, to, the, chinese, it, comes, off, as, an, offensive, gesture, according, to, matsumoto, and, juang, the, nonverbal, motions, of, different, people, indicate, important, channels, of, communication, nonverbal, actions, should, match, and, harmonize, with, the, message, being, portrayed, otherwise, confusion, will, occur, for, instance, an, individual, would, normally, not, be, seen, smiling, and, gesturing, broadly, when, saying, a, sad, message, the, author, states, that, nonverbal, communication, is, very, important, to, be, aware, of, especially, if, comparing, gestures, gaze, and, tone, of, voice, amongst, different, cultures, as, latin, american, cultures, embrace, big, speech, gestures, middle, eastern, cultures, are, relatively, more, modest, in, public, and, are, not, expressive, within, cultures, different, rules, are, made, about, staring, or, gazing, women, may, especially, avoid, eye, contact, with, men, because, it, can, be, taken, as, a, sign, of, sexual, interest, in, some, cultures, gaze, can, be, seen, as, a, sign, of, respect, in, western, culture, eye, contact, is, interpreted, as, attentiveness, and, honesty, in, hispanic, asian, middle, eastern, and, native, american, cultures, eye, contact, is, thought, to, be, disrespectful, or, rude, and, lack, of, eye, contact, does, not, mean, that, a, person, is, not, paying, attention, voice, is, a, category, that, changes, within, cultures, depending, on, whether, or, not, the, cultures, is, expressive, or, non, expressive, many, variants, of, the, voice, can, depict, different, reactions, the, acceptable, physical, distance, is, another, major, difference, in, the, nonverbal, communication, between, cultures, in, latin, america, and, the, middle, east, the, acceptable, distance, is, much, shorter, than, what, most, europeans, and, americans, feel, comfortable, with, this, is, why, an, american, or, a, european, might, wonder, why, the, other, person, is, invading, their, personal, space, by, standing, so, close, while, the, other, person, might, wonder, why, the, american, european, is, standing, so, far, from, them, in, addition, for, latin, americans, the, french, italians, and, arabs, the, distance, between, people, is, much, closer, than, the, distance, for, americans, in, general, for, these, close, distance, groups, 1, foot, of, distance, is, for, lovers, 1, 5, 4, feet, of, distance, is, for, family, and, friends, and, 4, 12, feet, is, for, strangers, 421, in, the, opposite, way, most, native, americans, value, distance, to, protect, themselves, 43, nonverbal, communication, is, commonly, used, to, facilitate, learning, in, indigenous, american, communities, nonverbal, communication, is, pivotal, for, collaborative, participation, in, shared, activities, as, children, from, indigenous, american, communities, will, learn, how, to, interact, using, nonverbal, communication, by, intently, observing, adults, nonverbal, communication, allows, for, continuous, keen, observation, and, signals, to, the, learner, when, participation, is, needed, culture, plays, an, important, role, in, nonverbal, communication, and, it, is, one, aspect, that, helps, to, influence, how, learning, activities, are, organized, in, many, indigenous, american, communities, for, example, there, is, often, an, emphasis, on, nonverbal, communication, which, acts, as, a, valued, means, by, which, children, learn, in, a, study, on, children, from, both, us, mexican, with, presumed, indigenous, backgrounds, and, european, american, heritages, who, watched, a, video, of, children, working, together, without, speaking, found, that, the, mexican, heritage, children, were, far, more, likely, to, describe, the, children, s, actions, as, collaborative, saying, that, the, children, in, the, video, were, talking, with, their, hands, and, with, their, eyes, a, key, characteristic, of, this, type, of, nonverbal, learning, is, that, children, have, the, opportunity, to, observe, and, interact, with, all, parts, of, an, activity, many, indigenous, american, children, are, in, close, contact, with, adults, and, other, children, who, are, performing, the, activities, that, they, will, eventually, master, objects, and, materials, become, familiar, to, the, child, as, the, activities, are, a, normal, part, of, everyday, life, learning, is, done, in, an, extremely, contextualized, environment, rather, than, one, specifically, tailored, to, be, instructional, for, example, the, direct, involvement, that, mazahua, children, take, in, the, marketplace, is, used, as, a, type, of, interactional, organization, for, learning, without, explicit, verbal, instruction, children, learn, how, to, run, a, market, stall, take, part, in, caregiving, and, also, learn, other, basic, responsibilities, through, non, structured, activities, cooperating, voluntarily, within, a, motivational, context, to, participate, not, explicitly, instructing, or, guiding, the, children, teaches, them, how, to, integrate, into, small, coordinated, groups, to, solve, a, problem, through, consensus, and, shared, space, these, mazahua, separate, but, together, practices, have, shown, that, participation, in, everyday, interaction, and, later, learning, activities, establishes, enculturation, that, is, rooted, in, nonverbal, social, experience, as, the, children, participate, in, everyday, interactions, they, are, simultaneously, learning, the, cultural, meanings, behind, these, interactions, children, s, experience, with, nonverbally, organized, social, interaction, helps, constitute, the, process, of, enculturation, in, some, indigenous, communities, of, the, americas, children, reported, one, of, their, main, reasons, for, working, in, their, home, was, to, build, unity, within, the, family, the, same, way, they, desire, to, build, solidarity, within, their, own, communities, most, indigenous, children, learn, the, importance, of, putting, in, this, work, in, the, form, of, nonverbal, communication, evidence, of, this, can, be, observed, in, a, case, study, where, children, are, guided, through, the, task, of, folding, a, paper, figure, by, observing, the, posture, and, gaze, of, those, who, guide, them, through, it, this, is, projected, onto, homes, and, communities, as, children, wait, for, certain, cues, from, others, to, initiative, cooperate, and, collaborate, one, aspect, of, nonverbal, communication, that, aids, in, conveying, these, precise, and, symbolic, meanings, is, context, embeddedness, the, idea, that, many, children, in, indigenous, american, communities, are, closely, involved, in, community, endeavors, both, spatially, and, relationally, which, help, to, promote, nonverbal, communication, given, that, words, are, not, always, necessary, when, children, are, closely, related, to, the, context, of, the, endeavor, as, active, participants, coordination, is, based, on, a, shared, reference, which, helps, to, allow, maintain, and, promote, nonverbal, communication, the, idea, of, context, embeddedness, allows, nonverbal, communication, to, be, a, means, of, learning, within, native, american, alaskan, athabaskans, and, cherokee, communities, by, observing, various, family, and, community, social, interactions, social, engagement, is, dominated, through, nonverbal, communication, for, example, when, children, elicit, thoughts, or, words, verbally, to, their, elders, they, are, expected, to, structure, their, speech, carefully, this, demonstrates, cultural, humility, and, respect, as, excessive, acts, of, speech, when, conversational, genre, shifts, reveal, weakness, and, disrespect, this, careful, self, censorship, exemplifies, traditional, social, interaction, of, athapaskin, and, cherokee, native, americans, who, are, mostly, dependent, on, nonverbal, communication, nonverbal, cues, are, used, by, most, children, in, the, warm, springs, indian, reservation, community, within, the, parameters, of, their, academic, learning, environments, this, includes, referencing, native, american, religion, through, stylized, hand, gestures, in, colloquial, communication, verbal, and, nonverbal, emotional, self, containment, and, less, movement, of, the, lower, face, to, structure, attention, on, the, eyes, during, face, to, face, engagement, therefore, children, s, approach, to, social, situations, within, a, reservation, classroom, for, example, may, act, as, a, barrier, to, a, predominantly, verbal, learning, environment, most, warm, springs, children, benefit, from, a, learning, model, that, suits, a, nonverbal, communicative, structure, of, collaboration, traditional, gesture, observational, learning, and, shared, references, it, is, important, to, note, that, while, nonverbal, communication, is, more, prevalent, in, indigenous, american, communities, verbal, communication, is, also, used, preferably, verbal, communication, does, not, substitute, one, s, involvement, in, an, activity, but, instead, acts, as, additional, guidance, or, support, towards, the, completion, of, an, activity, as, much, of, neurotypical, communication, is, nonverbal, learning, a, language, without, learning, its, corresponding, pragmatics, can, lead, to, miscommunication, this, can, lead, to, intercultural, conflict, according, to, marianna, pogosyan, ph, d, misunderstandings, and, ambiguities, in, communication, despite, language, fluency, nonverbal, communication, makes, the, difference, between, bringing, cultures, together, in, understanding, one, another, appearing, authentic, or, it, can, push, people, farther, away, due, to, misunderstandings, in, how, different, groups, see, certain, nonverbal, cues, or, gestures, from, birth, children, in, various, cultures, are, taught, the, gestures, and, cues, their, culture, defines, as, universal, which, is, not, the, case, for, others, but, some, movements, are, universal, evidence, suggests, neurotypical, humans, all, smile, when, happy, about, something, and, frown, when, something, is, upsetting, or, bad, in, the, study, of, nonverbal, communications, the, limbic, brain, is, where, the, action, is, because, it, is, the, part, of, the, brain, that, reacts, to, the, world, around, us, reflexively, and, instantaneously, in, real, time, and, without, thought, there, is, evidence, that, the, nonverbal, cues, made, from, person, to, person, do, not, entirely, have, something, to, do, with, environment, along, with, gestures, phenotypic, traits, can, also, convey, certain, messages, in, nonverbal, communication, for, instance, eye, color, hair, color, and, height, research, into, height, has, generally, found, that, taller, people, are, perceived, as, being, more, impressive, melamed, and, bozionelos, 1992, studied, a, sample, of, managers, in, the, united, kingdom, and, found, that, height, was, a, key, factor, in, who, was, promoted, height, can, have, benefits, and, depressors, too, while, tall, people, often, command, more, respect, than, short, people, height, can, also, be, detrimental, to, some, aspects, of, one, to, one, communication, for, instance, where, you, need, to, talk, on, the, same, level, or, have, an, eye, to, eye, discussion, with, another, person, and, do, not, want, to, be, perceived, as, too, big, for, your, boots, chronemics, is, the, way, time, is, used, our, use, of, time, can, communicate, and, send, messages, nonverbally, the, way, we, use, time, and, give, or, do, not, give, our, time, to, others, can, communicate, different, messages, chronemics, can, send, messages, to, others, about, what, we, value, and, also, send, messages, about, power, when, you, go, to, see, someone, who, is, in, a, position, of, power, over, you, such, as, your, supervisor, it, is, not, uncommon, to, be, kept, waiting, however, you, would, probably, consider, it, bad, form, to, make, a, more, powerful, person, wait, for, you, indeed, the, rule, seems, to, be, that, the, time, of, powerful, people, is, more, valuable, than, the, time, of, less, powerful, people, nonverbal, communication, plays, a, crucial, role, in, effectively, transmitting, messages, beginning, from, birth, and, persisting, throughout, one, s, life, it, undergoes, a, developmental, progression, encompassing, three, phases, ranging, from, initial, dyadic, exchanges, to, the, integration, of, both, verbal, and, nonverbal, cues, with, diverse, functions, nonverbal, communication, acts, as, a, substitute, for, verbal, interaction, in, situations, where, verbalization, is, unnecessary, or, impossible, it, adds, clarity, to, communication, by, unveiling, emotional, states, and, articulating, specific, feelings, this, is, achieved, through, various, nonverbal, elements, such, as, emblems, illustrators, regulators, adaptors, and, vocalics, this, system, is, shaped, by, component, including, paralinguistics, kinesics, tactile, communication, and, proxemics, influencing, social, academic, and, professional, contexts, despite, frequently, being, overlooked, nonverbal, cues, possess, the, potential, to, convey, up, to, 80, of, a, message, especially, holding, significance, in, interactions, involving, prelinguistic, infants, and, individuals, facing, severe, disabilities, the, cultural, nuances, of, these, cues, underscore, the, necessity, for, interpretation, emphasizing, the, contextual, signaling, and, interpretative, dimensions, kinesics, is, defined, as, movements, more, specifically, the, study, of, our, movements, involving, our, hands, body, and, face, this, form, of, nonverbal, communication, is, powerful, in, the, messages, it, sends, to, those, witnessing, them, the, term, was, first, coined, by, ray, birdwhistell, who, considered, the, term, body, language, inaccurate, and, instead, opted, to, explain, it, as, nonverbal, behaviors, stemming, from, body, movement, research, around, this, behavior, provides, some, examples, such, as, someone, casually, smiling, and, leaning, forward, as, well, as, maintaining, eye, contact, to, radiate, a, non, dominating, and, intimate, demeanor, in, contrast, someone, leaning, back, a, stoic, facial, expression, and, no, to, little, eye, contact, could, emit, an, unfriendly, and, dominating, demeanor, additional, research, expresses, that, eye, contact, is, an, important, part, of, nonverbal, communication, involved, in, kinesics, as, longer, and, appropriate, levels, of, eye, contact, give, an, individual, credibility, the, opposite, is, said, for, those, who, do, not, maintain, eye, contact, as, they, are, likely, to, be, deemed, distrustful, more, eye, contact, was, also, found, to, be, related, to, higher, levels, of, likability, and, believability, from, those, people, interacted, with, a, real, life, example, of, this, is, through, service, workers, in, a, study, it, was, found, that, those, workers, who, welcomed, customers, with, smiles, seemed, like, warmer, individuals, than, those, who, did, not, smile, customers, reported, that, those, without, smiles, and, open, body, movements, such, as, waving, or, handshaking, were, lacking, warmth, and, deemed, less, friendly, haptics, is, the, study, of, touching, as, nonverbal, communication, and, haptic, communication, refers, to, how, people, and, other, animals, communicate, via, touching, touches, among, humans, that, can, be, defined, as, communication, include, handshakes, holding, hands, kissing, cheek, lips, hand, back, slapping, high, fives, a, pat, on, the, shoulder, and, brushing, an, arm, touching, of, oneself, may, include, licking, picking, holding, and, scratching, 9, these, behaviors, are, referred, to, as, adapters, or, tells, and, may, send, messages, that, reveal, the, intentions, or, feelings, of, a, communicator, and, a, listener, the, meaning, conveyed, from, touch, is, highly, dependent, upon, the, culture, the, context, of, the, situation, the, relationship, between, communicators, and, the, manner, of, touch, 10, touch, is, an, extremely, important, sense, for, humans, as, well, as, providing, information, about, surfaces, and, textures, it, is, a, component, of, nonverbal, communication, in, interpersonal, relationships, and, vital, in, conveying, physical, intimacy, it, can, be, both, sexual, such, as, kissing, and, platonic, such, as, hugging, or, tickling, touch, is, the, earliest, sense, to, develop, in, the, fetus, human, babies, have, been, observed, to, have, enormous, difficulty, surviving, if, they, do, not, possess, a, sense, of, touch, even, if, they, retain, sight, and, hearing, babies, who, can, perceive, through, touch, even, without, sight, and, hearing, tend, to, fare, much, better, in, chimpanzees, the, sense, of, touch, is, highly, developed, as, newborns, they, see, and, hear, poorly, but, cling, strongly, to, their, mothers, harry, harlow, conducted, a, controversial, study, involving, rhesus, monkeys, and, observed, that, monkeys, reared, with, a, terry, cloth, mother, a, wire, feeding, apparatus, wrapped, in, soft, terry, cloth, that, provided, a, level, of, tactile, stimulation, and, comfort, the, monkey, who, had, the, real, parent, were, considerably, more, emotionally, stable, as, adults, than, those, with, a, mere, wire, mother, harlow, 1958, touching, is, treated, differently, from, one, country, to, another, and, socially, acceptable, levels, of, touching, vary, from, one, culture, to, another, remland, 2009, in, thai, culture, for, example, touching, someone, s, head, may, be, thought, rude, remland, and, jones, 1995, studied, groups, of, people, communicating, and, found, that, touching, was, rare, among, the, english, 8, the, french, 5, and, the, dutch, 4, compared, to, italians, 14, and, greeks, 12, 5, striking, pushing, pulling, pinching, kicking, strangling, and, hand, to, hand, fighting, are, forms, of, touch, in, the, context, of, physical, abuse, in, the, journal, of, nonverbal, behavior, mcdaniel, et, al, assessed, touch, as, a, form, of, communication, among, people, from, different, nations, under, the, lens, of, culture, relationships, and, a, number, of, body, areas, touched, latin, americans, are, known, to, have, a, high, degree, of, tactile, activity, in, contrast, to, asians, who, are, considered, a, no, contact, culture, as, they, often, steer, away, from, public, display, of, affection, pda, proxemics, is, defined, as, the, use, of, space, as, a, form, of, communication, and, includes, how, far, or, near, you, position, yourself, from, others, it, can, be, influenced, by, culture, race, ethnicity, gender, and, age, edward, t, hall, invented, the, term, when, he, realized, that, culture, influences, how, people, use, space, in, communication, while, working, with, diplomats, and, published, his, findings, on, proxemics, in, 1959, as, the, silent, language, proxemics, also, play, a, big, role, in, business, as, research, shows, that, gender, and, invasion, of, customers, privacy, without, previous, ties, negatively, affect, the, outcome, of, deals, besides, in, high, contact, cultures, people, are, generally, more, comfortable, in, closer, proximity, whereas, individuals, in, low, contact, cultures, feel, more, comfortable, with, a, greater, amount, of, personal, space, hall, concluded, that, proxemics, could, cause, misunderstandings, between, cultures, as, cultures, use, of, proxemics, varies, and, what, is, customary, in, one, culture, may, range, from, being, confusing, to, being, offensive, to, members, of, a, different, culture, according, to, edward, t, hall, the, amount, of, space, we, maintain, between, ourselves, and, the, persons, we, communicate, with, shows, the, importance, of, the, science, of, proxemics, in, this, process, it, is, seen, how, we, feel, towards, others, at, that, particular, time, this, resonates, with, proxemics, and, viewing, it, through, the, cultural, lens, people, use, their, space, differently, because, of, the, meaning, behind, it, as, in, a, spectrum, of, cultures, ideologies, differ, within, american, culture, hall, defines, four, primary, distance, zones, i, intimate, touching, to, eighteen, inches, distance, ii, personal, eighteen, inches, to, four, feet, distance, iii, social, four, to, twelve, feet, distance, and, iv, public, more, than, twelve, feet, distance, intimate, space, is, any, distance, less, than, 18, inches, and, is, most, commonly, used, by, individuals, when, they, are, engaging, with, someone, with, whom, they, feel, very, comfortable, such, as, a, spouse, partner, friend, child, or, parent, personal, space, is, a, distance, of, 18, inches, to, 4, feet, and, is, usually, used, when, individuals, are, interacting, with, friends, social, distance, is, the, most, common, type, of, proximity, as, it, is, used, when, communicating, with, colleagues, classmates, acquaintances, or, strangers, public, distance, creates, the, greatest, gap, between, the, individual, and, the, audience, and, is, categorized, as, distances, greater, than, 12, feet, in, distance, and, is, often, used, for, speeches, lectures, or, formal, occasions, when, communicating, face, to, face, with, someone, it, is, sometimes, hard, to, differentiate, which, parts, of, conversing, are, communicated, via, verbally, or, non, verbally, other, studies, done, on, the, same, subject, have, concluded, that, in, more, relaxed, and, natural, settings, of, communication, verbal, and, non, verbal, signals, and, cues, can, contribute, in, surprisingly, similar, ways, argyle, using, video, tapes, shown, to, the, subjects, analysed, the, communication, of, submissive, dominant, attitude, high, and, low, context, high, context, resorting, to, more, strict, social, classes, and, take, a, more, short, and, quick, response, route, to, portray, dominance, low, context, being, the, opposite, by, taking, time, to, explain, everything, and, putting, a, lot, of, importance, on, communication, and, building, trust, and, respect, with, others, in, a, submissive, and, relaxed, manner, and, found, that, non, verbal, cues, had, 4, 3, times, the, effect, of, verbal, cues, the, most, important, effect, was, that, body, posture, communicated, superior, status, specific, to, culture, and, context, said, person, grew, up, in, in, a, very, efficient, way, on, the, other, hand, a, study, by, hsee, et, al, had, subjects, judge, a, person, on, the, dimension, happy, sad, and, found, that, words, spoken, with, minimal, variation, in, intonation, had, an, impact, about, 4, times, larger, than, face, expressions, seen, in, a, film, without, sound, therefore, when, considering, certain, non, verbal, mannerisms, such, as, facial, expressions, and, physical, cues, they, can, conflict, in, meaning, when, compared, to, spoken, language, and, emotions, different, set, ups, and, scenarios, would, yield, different, responses, and, meanings, when, using, both, types, of, communication, in, other, ways, they, can, complement, each, other, provided, they, are, used, together, wisely, during, a, conversation, when, seeking, to, communicate, effectively, it, is, important, that, the, nonverbal, conversation, supports, the, verbal, conversation, and, vice, versa, if, the, nonverbal, cues, converge, with, what, we, are, saying, verbally, then, our, message, is, further, reinforced, mindfulness, is, one, technique, that, can, help, improve, our, awareness, of, nvc, if, we, become, more, mindful, and, present, to, how, our, body, is, moving, then, we, can, better, control, our, external, nonverbal, communication, which, results, in, more, effective, communication, during, communication, nonverbal, messages, can, interact, with, verbal, messages, in, six, ways, repeating, conflicting, complementing, substituting, regulating, and, accenting, moderating, conflicting, verbal, and, nonverbal, messages, within, the, same, interaction, can, sometimes, send, opposing, or, conflicting, messages, a, person, verbally, expressing, a, statement, of, truth, while, simultaneously, fidgeting, or, avoiding, eye, contact, may, convey, a, mixed, message, to, the, receiver, in, the, interaction, conflicting, messages, may, occur, for, a, variety, of, reasons, often, stemming, from, feelings, of, uncertainty, ambivalence, or, frustration, when, mixed, messages, occur, nonverbal, communication, becomes, the, primary, tool, people, use, to, attain, additional, information, to, clarify, the, situation, great, attention, is, placed, on, bodily, movements, and, positioning, when, people, perceive, mixed, messages, during, interactions, definitions, of, nonverbal, communication, creates, a, limited, picture, in, our, minds, but, there, are, ways, to, create, a, clearer, one, there, are, different, dimensions, of, verbal, and, nonverbal, communication, that, have, been, discovered, they, are, 1, structure, versus, non, structure, 2, linguistic, versus, non, linguistic, 3, continuous, versus, discontinuous, 4, learned, versus, innate, and, 5, left, versus, right, hemispheric, processing, 7, accurate, interpretation, of, messages, is, made, easier, when, nonverbal, and, verbal, communication, complement, each, other, nonverbal, cues, can, be, used, to, elaborate, on, verbal, messages, to, reinforce, the, information, sent, when, trying, to, achieve, communicative, goals, messages, have, been, shown, to, be, remembered, better, when, nonverbal, signals, affirm, the, verbal, exchange, 14, nonverbal, behavior, is, sometimes, used, as, the, sole, channel, for, communication, of, a, message, people, learn, to, identify, facial, expressions, body, movements, and, body, positioning, as, corresponding, with, specific, feelings, and, intentions, nonverbal, signals, can, be, used, without, verbal, communication, to, convey, messages, when, nonverbal, behavior, does, not, effectively, communicate, a, message, verbal, methods, are, used, to, enhance, understanding, 16, verbal, communication, is, a, highly, structured, form, of, communication, with, set, rules, of, grammar, the, rules, of, verbal, communication, help, to, understand, and, make, sense, of, what, other, people, are, saying, for, example, foreigners, learning, a, new, language, can, have, a, hard, time, making, themselves, understood, on, the, other, hand, nonverbal, communication, has, no, formal, structure, when, it, comes, to, communicating, nonverbal, communication, occurs, without, even, thinking, about, it, the, same, behavior, can, mean, different, things, such, as, crying, of, sadness, or, of, joy, therefore, these, cues, need, to, be, interpreted, carefully, to, get, their, correct, meaning, 7, 8, there, are, only, a, few, assigned, symbols, in, the, system, of, nonverbal, communication, nodding, the, head, is, one, symbol, that, indicates, agreement, in, some, cultures, but, in, others, it, means, disagreement, on, the, other, hand, verbal, communication, has, a, system, of, symbols, that, have, specific, meanings, to, them, 8, verbal, communication, is, based, on, discontinuous, units, whereas, nonverbal, communication, is, continuous, communicating, nonverbally, cannot, be, stopped, unless, one, would, leave, the, room, but, even, then, the, intrapersonal, processes, still, take, place, individuals, communicating, with, themselves, without, the, presence, of, someone, else, the, body, still, manages, to, undergo, nonverbal, communication, for, example, there, are, no, other, words, being, spoken, after, a, heated, debate, but, there, are, still, angry, faces, and, cold, stares, being, distributed, this, is, an, example, of, how, nonverbal, communication, is, continuous, 8, learned, non, verbal, cues, require, a, community, or, culture, for, their, reinforcement, for, example, table, manners, are, not, innate, capabilities, upon, birth, dress, code, is, a, non, verbal, cue, that, must, be, established, by, society, hand, symbols, whose, interpretation, can, vary, from, culture, to, culture, are, not, innate, nonverbal, cues, learned, cues, must, be, gradually, reinforced, by, admonition, or, positive, feedback, innate, non, verbal, cues, are, built, in, features, of, human, behavior, generally, these, innate, cues, are, universally, prevalent, and, regardless, of, culture, for, example, smiling, crying, and, laughing, do, not, require, teaching, similarly, some, body, positions, such, as, the, fetal, position, are, universally, associated, with, weakness, due, to, their, universality, the, ability, to, comprehend, these, cues, is, not, limited, to, individual, cultures, 9, this, type, of, processing, involves, the, neurophysiological, approach, to, nonverbal, communication, it, explains, that, the, right, hemisphere, processes, nonverbal, stimuli, such, as, those, involving, spatial, pictorial, and, gestalt, tasks, while, the, left, hemisphere, involves, the, verbal, stimuli, involving, analytical, and, reasoning, tasks, it, is, important, to, know, the, implications, in, processing, the, differences, between, verbal, and, nonverbal, communication, messages, it, is, possible, that, individuals, may, not, use, the, correct, hemisphere, at, appropriate, times, when, it, comes, to, interpreting, a, message, or, meaning, 9, from, 1977, to, 2004, the, influence, of, disease, and, drugs, on, receptivity, of, nonverbal, communication, was, studied, by, teams, at, three, separate, medical, schools, using, a, similar, paradigm, researchers, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, yale, university, and, ohio, state, university, had, subjects, observe, gamblers, at, a, slot, machine, awaiting, payoffs, the, amount, of, this, payoff, was, read, by, nonverbal, transmission, prior, to, reinforcement, this, technique, was, developed, by, and, the, studies, directed, by, psychologist, robert, e, miller, and, psychiatrist, a, james, giannini, these, groups, reported, diminished, receptive, ability, in, heroin, addicts, and, phencyclidine, abusers, contrasted, with, increased, receptivity, in, cocaine, addicts, men, with, major, depression, manifested, significantly, decreased, ability, to, read, nonverbal, cues, when, compared, with, euthymic, men, in, some, subjects, tested, for, ability, to, read, nonverbal, cues, intuitive, paradigms, were, apparently, employed, while, in, others, a, cause, and, effect, approach, was, used, subjects, in, the, former, group, answered, quickly, and, before, reinforcement, occurred, they, could, not, give, a, rationale, for, their, particular, responses, subjects, in, the, latter, category, delayed, their, response, and, could, offer, reasons, for, their, choice, the, level, of, accuracy, between, the, two, groups, did, not, vary, nor, did, handedness, obese, women, and, women, with, premenstrual, syndrome, were, found, to, also, possess, diminished, abilities, to, read, these, cues, in, contradistinction, men, with, bipolar, disorder, possessed, increased, abilities, a, woman, with, total, paralysis, of, the, nerves, of, facial, expression, was, found, unable, to, transmit, or, receive, any, nonverbal, facial, cues, whatsoever, because, of, the, changes, in, levels, of, accuracy, on, the, levels, of, nonverbal, receptivity, the, members, of, the, research, team, hypothesized, a, biochemical, site, in, the, brain, which, was, operative, for, reception, of, nonverbal, cues, because, certain, drugs, enhanced, ability, while, others, diminished, it, the, neurotransmitters, dopamine, and, endorphin, were, considered, to, be, likely, etiological, candidate, based, on, the, available, data, however, the, primary, cause, and, primary, effect, could, not, be, sorted, out, on, the, basis, of, the, paradigm, employed, an, increased, emphasis, on, gestures, exists, when, intonations, or, facial, expression, are, used, speakers, often, anticipate, how, recipients, will, interpret, their, utterances, if, they, wish, some, other, less, obvious, interpretation, they, may, mark, their, utterance, e, g, with, special, intonations, or, facial, expressions, this, specific, emphasis, known, as, marking, can, be, spotted, as, a, learned, form, of, non, verbal, communication, in, toddlers, a, groundbreaking, study, from, carpenter, et, al, in, the, journal, of, child, language, has, concluded, that, the, act, of, marking, a, gesture, is, recognized, by, three, year, olds, but, not, by, two, year, olds, in, the, study, two, and, three, year, old, toddlers, were, tested, on, their, recognition, of, markedness, within, gestures, the, experiment, was, conducted, in, a, room, with, an, examiner, and, the, test, subjects, which, for, the, first, study, were, three, year, olds, the, examiner, sat, across, from, each, child, individually, and, allowed, them, to, play, with, various, objects, including, a, purse, with, a, sponge, in, it, and, a, box, with, a, sponge, in, it, after, allowing, the, child, to, play, with, the, objects, for, three, minutes, the, examiner, told, the, child, it, was, time, to, clean, up, and, motioned, by, pointing, to, the, objects, they, measured, the, responses, of, the, children, by, first, pointing, and, not, marking, the, gesture, to, see, the, child, s, reaction, to, the, request, and, if, they, reached, for, the, objects, to, clean, them, up, after, observing, the, child, s, response, the, examiner, then, asked, and, pointed, again, marking, the, gesture, with, facial, expression, as, to, lead, the, child, to, believe, the, objects, were, supposed, to, be, cleaned, up, the, results, showed, that, three, year, old, children, were, able, to, recognize, the, markedness, by, responding, to, the, gesture, and, cleaning, the, objects, up, as, opposed, to, when, the, gesture, was, presented, without, being, marked, in, the, second, study, in, which, the, same, experiment, was, performed, on, two, year, olds, the, results, were, different, for, the, most, part, the, children, did, not, recognize, the, difference, between, the, marked, and, unmarked, gesture, by, not, responding, more, prevalently, to, the, marked, gesture, unlike, the, results, of, the, three, year, olds, this, shows, that, this, sort, of, nonverbal, communication, is, learned, at, a, young, age, and, is, better, recognized, in, three, year, old, children, than, two, year, old, children, making, it, easier, for, us, to, interpret, that, the, ability, to, recognize, markedness, is, learned, in, the, early, stages, of, development, somewhere, between, three, and, four, years, of, age, boone, and, cunningham, conducted, a, study, to, determine, at, which, age, children, begin, to, recognize, emotional, meaning, happiness, sadness, anger, and, fear, in, expressive, body, movements, the, study, included, 29, adults, and, 79, children, divided, into, age, groups, of, four, five, and, eight, year, olds, the, children, were, shown, two, clips, simultaneously, and, were, asked, to, point, to, the, one, that, was, expressing, the, target, emotion, the, results, of, the, study, revealed, that, of, the, four, emotions, being, tested, the, 4, year, olds, were, only, able, to, correctly, identify, sadness, at, a, rate, that, was, better, than, chance, the, 5, year, olds, performed, better, and, were, able, to, identify, happiness, sadness, and, fear, at, better, than, chance, levels, the, 8, year, olds, and, adults, could, correctly, identify, all, four, emotions, and, there, was, very, little, difference, between, the, scores, of, the, two, groups, between, the, ages, of, 4, and, 8, nonverbal, communication, and, decoding, skills, improve, dramatically, a, byproduct, of, the, work, of, the, pittsburgh, yale, ohio, state, team, was, an, investigation, of, the, role, of, nonverbal, facial, cues, in, heterosexual, nondate, rape, males, who, were, serial, rapists, of, adult, women, were, studied, for, nonverbal, receptive, abilities, their, scores, were, the, highest, of, any, subgroup, rape, victims, were, next, tested, it, was, reported, that, women, who, had, been, raped, on, at, least, two, occasions, by, different, perpetrators, had, a, highly, significant, impairment, in, their, abilities, to, read, these, cues, in, either, male, or, female, senders, these, results, were, troubling, indicating, a, predator, prey, model, the, authors, did, note, that, whatever, the, nature, of, these, preliminary, findings, the, responsibility, of, the, rapist, was, in, no, manner, or, level, diminished, the, final, target, of, study, for, this, group, was, the, medical, students, they, taught, medical, students, at, ohio, state, university, ohio, university, and, northeast, ohio, medical, college, were, invited, to, serve, as, subjects, students, indicating, a, preference, for, the, specialties, of, family, practice, psychiatry, pediatrics, and, obstetrics, gynecology, achieved, significantly, higher, levels, of, accuracy, than, those, students, who, planned, to, train, as, surgeons, radiologists, or, pathologists, internal, medicine, and, plastic, surgery, candidates, scored, at, levels, near, the, mean
