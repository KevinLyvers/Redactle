econometrics, is, an, application, of, statistical, methods, to, economic, data, in, order, to, give, empirical, content, to, economic, relationships, more, precisely, it, is, the, quantitative, analysis, of, actual, economic, phenomena, based, on, the, concurrent, development, of, theory, and, observation, related, by, appropriate, methods, of, inference, an, introductory, economics, textbook, describes, econometrics, as, allowing, economists, to, sift, through, mountains, of, data, to, extract, simple, relationships, jan, tinbergen, is, one, of, the, two, founding, fathers, of, econometrics, the, other, ragnar, frisch, also, coined, the, term, in, the, sense, in, which, it, is, used, today, a, basic, tool, for, econometrics, is, the, multiple, linear, regression, model, econometric, theory, uses, statistical, theory, and, mathematical, statistics, to, evaluate, and, develop, econometric, methods, econometricians, try, to, find, estimators, that, have, desirable, statistical, properties, including, unbiasedness, efficiency, and, consistency, applied, econometrics, uses, theoretical, econometrics, and, real, world, data, for, assessing, economic, theories, developing, econometric, models, analysing, economic, history, and, forecasting, a, basic, tool, for, econometrics, is, the, multiple, linear, regression, model, in, modern, econometrics, other, statistical, tools, are, frequently, used, but, linear, regression, is, still, the, most, frequently, used, starting, point, for, an, analysis, estimating, a, linear, regression, on, two, variables, can, be, visualised, as, fitting, a, line, through, data, points, representing, paired, values, of, the, independent, and, dependent, variables, for, example, consider, okun, s, law, which, relates, gdp, growth, to, the, unemployment, rate, this, relationship, is, represented, in, a, linear, regression, where, the, change, in, unemployment, rate, unemployment, displaystyle, delta, text, unemployment, is, a, function, of, an, intercept, 0, displaystyle, beta, 0, a, given, value, of, gdp, growth, multiplied, by, a, slope, coefficient, 1, displaystyle, beta, 1, and, an, error, term, displaystyle, varepsilon, the, unknown, parameters, 0, displaystyle, beta, 0, and, 1, displaystyle, beta, 1, can, be, estimated, here, 0, displaystyle, beta, 0, is, estimated, to, be, 0, 83, and, 1, displaystyle, beta, 1, is, estimated, to, be, 1, 77, this, means, that, if, gdp, growth, increased, by, one, percentage, point, the, unemployment, rate, would, be, predicted, to, drop, by, 1, 77, 1, points, other, things, held, constant, the, model, could, then, be, tested, for, statistical, significance, as, to, whether, an, increase, in, gdp, growth, is, associated, with, a, decrease, in, the, unemployment, as, hypothesized, if, the, estimate, of, 1, displaystyle, beta, 1, were, not, significantly, different, from, 0, the, test, would, fail, to, find, evidence, that, changes, in, the, growth, rate, and, unemployment, rate, were, related, the, variance, in, a, prediction, of, the, dependent, variable, unemployment, as, a, function, of, the, independent, variable, gdp, growth, is, given, in, polynomial, least, squares, econometric, theory, uses, statistical, theory, and, mathematical, statistics, to, evaluate, and, develop, econometric, methods, econometricians, try, to, find, estimators, that, have, desirable, statistical, properties, including, unbiasedness, efficiency, and, consistency, an, estimator, is, unbiased, if, its, expected, value, is, the, true, value, of, the, parameter, it, is, consistent, if, it, converges, to, the, true, value, as, the, sample, size, gets, larger, and, it, is, efficient, if, the, estimator, has, lower, standard, error, than, other, unbiased, estimators, for, a, given, sample, size, ordinary, least, squares, ols, is, often, used, for, estimation, since, it, provides, the, blue, or, best, linear, unbiased, estimator, where, best, means, most, efficient, unbiased, estimator, given, the, gauss, markov, assumptions, when, these, assumptions, are, violated, or, other, statistical, properties, are, desired, other, estimation, techniques, such, as, maximum, likelihood, estimation, generalized, method, of, moments, or, generalized, least, squares, are, used, estimators, that, incorporate, prior, beliefs, are, advocated, by, those, who, favour, bayesian, statistics, over, traditional, classical, or, frequentist, approaches, applied, econometrics, uses, theoretical, econometrics, and, real, world, data, for, assessing, economic, theories, developing, econometric, models, analysing, economic, history, and, forecasting, econometrics, may, use, standard, statistical, models, to, study, economic, questions, but, most, often, they, are, with, observational, data, rather, than, in, controlled, experiments, in, this, the, design, of, observational, studies, in, econometrics, is, similar, to, the, design, of, studies, in, other, observational, disciplines, such, as, astronomy, epidemiology, sociology, and, political, science, analysis, of, data, from, an, observational, study, is, guided, by, the, study, protocol, although, exploratory, data, analysis, may, be, useful, for, generating, new, hypotheses, economics, often, analyses, systems, of, equations, and, inequalities, such, as, supply, and, demand, hypothesized, to, be, in, equilibrium, consequently, the, field, of, econometrics, has, developed, methods, for, identification, and, estimation, of, simultaneous, equations, models, these, methods, are, analogous, to, methods, used, in, other, areas, of, science, such, as, the, field, of, system, identification, in, systems, analysis, and, control, theory, such, methods, may, allow, researchers, to, estimate, models, and, investigate, their, empirical, consequences, without, directly, manipulating, the, system, one, of, the, fundamental, statistical, methods, used, by, econometricians, is, regression, analysis, regression, methods, are, important, in, econometrics, because, economists, typically, cannot, use, controlled, experiments, typically, the, most, readily, available, data, is, retrospective, however, retrospective, analysis, of, observational, data, may, be, subject, to, omitted, variable, bias, reverse, causality, or, other, limitations, that, cast, doubt, on, causal, interpretation, of, the, correlations, in, the, absence, of, evidence, from, controlled, experiments, econometricians, often, seek, illuminating, natural, experiments, or, apply, quasi, experimental, methods, to, draw, credible, causal, inference, the, methods, include, regression, discontinuity, design, instrumental, variables, and, difference, in, differences, a, simple, example, of, a, relationship, in, econometrics, from, the, field, of, labour, economics, is, this, example, assumes, that, the, natural, logarithm, of, a, person, s, wage, is, a, linear, function, of, the, number, of, years, of, education, that, person, has, acquired, the, parameter, 1, displaystyle, beta, 1, measures, the, increase, in, the, natural, log, of, the, wage, attributable, to, one, more, year, of, education, the, term, displaystyle, varepsilon, is, a, random, variable, representing, all, other, factors, that, may, have, direct, influence, on, wage, the, econometric, goal, is, to, estimate, the, parameters, 0, and, 1, displaystyle, beta, 0, mbox, and, beta, 1, under, specific, assumptions, about, the, random, variable, displaystyle, varepsilon, for, example, if, displaystyle, varepsilon, is, uncorrelated, with, years, of, education, then, the, equation, can, be, estimated, with, ordinary, least, squares, if, the, researcher, could, randomly, assign, people, to, different, levels, of, education, the, data, set, thus, generated, would, allow, estimation, of, the, effect, of, changes, in, years, of, education, on, wages, in, reality, those, experiments, cannot, be, conducted, instead, the, econometrician, observes, the, years, of, education, of, and, the, wages, paid, to, people, who, differ, along, many, dimensions, given, this, kind, of, data, the, estimated, coefficient, on, years, of, education, in, the, equation, above, reflects, both, the, effect, of, education, on, wages, and, the, effect, of, other, variables, on, wages, if, those, other, variables, were, correlated, with, education, for, example, people, born, in, certain, places, may, have, higher, wages, and, higher, levels, of, education, unless, the, econometrician, controls, for, place, of, birth, in, the, above, equation, the, effect, of, birthplace, on, wages, may, be, falsely, attributed, to, the, effect, of, education, on, wages, the, most, obvious, way, to, control, for, birthplace, is, to, include, a, measure, of, the, effect, of, birthplace, in, the, equation, above, exclusion, of, birthplace, together, with, the, assumption, that, displaystyle, epsilon, is, uncorrelated, with, education, produces, a, misspecified, model, another, technique, is, to, include, in, the, equation, additional, set, of, measured, covariates, which, are, not, instrumental, variables, yet, render, 1, displaystyle, beta, 1, identifiable, an, overview, of, econometric, methods, used, to, study, this, problem, were, provided, by, card, 1999, the, main, journals, that, publish, work, in, econometrics, are, like, other, forms, of, statistical, analysis, badly, specified, econometric, models, may, show, a, spurious, relationship, where, two, variables, are, correlated, but, causally, unrelated, in, a, study, of, the, use, of, econometrics, in, major, economics, journals, mccloskey, concluded, that, some, economists, report, p, values, following, the, fisherian, tradition, of, tests, of, significance, of, point, null, hypotheses, and, neglect, concerns, of, type, ii, errors, some, economists, fail, to, report, estimates, of, the, size, of, effects, apart, from, statistical, significance, and, to, discuss, their, economic, importance, she, also, argues, that, some, economists, also, fail, to, use, economic, reasoning, for, model, selection, especially, for, deciding, which, variables, to, include, in, a, regression, in, some, cases, economic, variables, cannot, be, experimentally, manipulated, as, treatments, randomly, assigned, to, subjects, in, such, cases, economists, rely, on, observational, studies, often, using, data, sets, with, many, strongly, associated, covariates, resulting, in, enormous, numbers, of, models, with, similar, explanatory, ability, but, different, covariates, and, regression, estimates, regarding, the, plurality, of, models, compatible, with, observational, data, sets, edward, leamer, urged, that, professionals, properly, withhold, belief, until, an, inference, can, be, shown, to, be, adequately, insensitive, to, the, choice, of, assumptions
