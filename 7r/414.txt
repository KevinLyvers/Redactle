exact, territory, the, autochthony, thesis, it, developed, in, left, danube, dacia, only, the, discontinuation, thesis, it, developed, in, right, danube, provinces, only, and, the, as, well, as, thesis, that, supports, the, language, development, on, both, sides, of, the, danube, between, the, 6th, and, 8th, century, following, the, accumulated, tendencies, inherited, from, the, vernacular, spoken, in, this, large, area, and, to, a, much, smaller, degree, the, influences, from, native, dialects, and, in, the, context, of, a, lessened, power, of, the, roman, central, authority, the, language, evolved, into, common, romanian, this, proto, language, then, came, into, close, contact, with, the, slavic, languages, and, subsequently, divided, into, aromanian, megleno, romanian, istro, romanian, and, daco, romanian, due, to, limited, attestation, between, the, 6th, and, 16th, century, entire, stages, from, its, history, are, re, constructed, by, researchers, often, with, proposed, relative, chronologies, and, loose, limits, from, the, 12th, or, 13th, century, official, documents, and, religious, texts, were, written, in, old, church, slavonic, a, language, that, had, a, similar, role, to, medieval, latin, in, western, europe, the, oldest, dated, text, in, romanian, is, a, letter, written, in, 1521, with, cyrillic, letters, and, until, late, 18th, century, including,

languages, entered, the, lexis, in, the, process, of, language, evolution, from, fewer, than, 2500, attested, words, from, late, antiquity, to, a, lexicon, of, over, 150, 000, words, in, its,

scholars, agree, that, two, major, dialects, developed, from, common, romanian, by, the, 10th, century, daco, romanian, the, official, language, of, romania, and, moldova, and, istro, romanian, a, language, spoken, by, no, more, than, 2, 000, people, in, istria, descended, from, the, northern, dialect, two, other, languages, aromanian, and, megleno, romanian, developed, from, the, southern, version, of, common, romanian, these, two, languages, are, now, spoken, in, lands, to, the, south, of, the, jire, ek, line, of, the, features, that, individualize, common, romanian, inherited, from,

aldea, teodorovici, performed, a, song, called, the, romanian, language, romanian, is, also, called, daco, romanian, in, comparative, linguistics, to, distinguish, from, the, other, dialects, of, common, romanian, aromanian, megleno, romanian, and, istro, romanian, the, origin, of, the, term, daco, romanian, can, be, traced, back, to, the, first, printed, book, of, romanian, grammar, in, 1780, by, samuil, micu, and, gheorghe, incai, there, the, romanian, dialect, spoken, north, of, the, danube, is, called, lingua, daco, romana, to, emphasize, its, origin, and, its, area, of, use, which, includes, the, former, roman, province, of, dacia, although, it, is, spoken, also, south, of, the, danube, in, dobruja, the, timok, valley, and, northern, bulgaria, this, article, deals, with, the, romanian, i, e, daco, romanian, language, and, thus, only, its, dialectal, variations, are, discussed, here, the, differences, between, the, regional, varieties, are, small, limited, to, regular, phonetic, changes, few, grammar, aspects, and, lexical, particularities, there, is, a, single, written, and, spoken, standard, literary, romanian, language, used, by, all, speakers, regardless, of, region, like, most, natural, languages, romanian, dialects, are, part, of, a, dialect, continuum, the, dialects, of, romanian, are, also, referred, to, as, sub, dialects, and, are, distinguished, primarily, by, phonetic, differences, romanians, themselves, speak, of, the, differences, as, accents, or, speeches, in, romanian, accent, or, grai, depending, on, the, criteria, used, for, classifying, these, dialects, fewer, or, more, are, found, ranging, from, 2, to, 20, although, the, most, widespread, approaches, give, a, number, of, five, dialects, these, are, grouped, into, two, main, types, southern, and, northern, further, divided, as, follows, over, the, last, century, however, regional, accents, have, been, weakened, due, to, mass, communication, and, greater, mobility, some, argots, and, speech, forms, have, also, arisen, from, the, romanian, language, examples, are, the, gumu, easca, spoken, in, m, rg, u, and, the, totoiana, an, inverted, version, of, romanian, spoken, in, totoi, romanian, is, a, romance, language, belonging, to, the, italic, branch, of, the, indo, european, language, family, having, much, in, common, with, languages, such, as, italian, spanish, french, and, portuguese, compared, with, the, other, romance, languages, the, closest, relative, of, romanian, is, italian, romanian, has, had, a, greater, share, of, foreign, influence, than, some, other, romance, languages, such, as, italian, in, terms, of, vocabulary, and, other, aspects, a, study, conducted, by, mario, pei, in, 1949, which, analyzed, the, degree, of, differentiation, of, languages, from, their, parental, language, in, the, case, of, romance, languages, to, latin, comparing, phonology, inflection, discourse, syntax, vocabulary, and, intonation, produced, the, following, percentages, the, higher, the, percentage, the, greater, the, distance, from, latin, the, lexical, similarity, of, romanian, with, italian, has, been, estimated, at, 77, followed, by, french, at, 75, sardinian, 74, catalan, 73, portuguese, and, rhaeto, romance, 72, spanish, 71, the, romanian, vocabulary, became, predominantly, influenced, by, french, and, to, a, lesser, extent, italian, in, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, while, most, of, romanian, grammar, and, morphology, are, based, on, latin, there, are, some, features, that, are, shared, only, with, other, languages, of, the, balkans, and, not, found, in, other, romance, languages, the, shared, features, of, romanian, and, the, other, languages, of, the, balkan, language, area, bulgarian, macedonian, albanian, greek, and, serbo, croatian, include, a, suffixed, definite, article, the, syncretism, of, genitive, and, dative, case, and, the, formation, of, the, future, and, the, alternation, of, infinitive, with, subjunctive, constructions, according, to, a, well, established, scholarly, theory, most, balkanisms, could, be, traced, back, to, the, development, of, the, balkan, romance, languages, these, features, were, adopted, by, other, languages, due, to, language, shift, slavic, influence, on, romanian, is, especially, noticeable, in, its, vocabulary, with, words, of, slavic, origin, constituting, about, 10, 15, of, modern, romanian, lexicon, and, with, further, influences, in, its, phonetics, morphology, and, syntax, the, greater, part, of, its, slavic, vocabulary, comes, from, old, church, slavonic, which, was, the, official, written, language, of, wallachia, and, moldavia, from, the, 14th, to, the, 18th, century, although, not, understood, by, most, people, as, well, as, the, liturgical, language, of, the, romanian, orthodox, church, as, a, result, much, romanian, vocabulary, dealing, with, religion, ritual, and, hierarchy, is, slavic, the, number, of, high, frequency, slavic, derived, words, is, also, believed, to, indicate, contact, or, cohabitation, with, south, slavic, tribes, from, around, the, 6th, century, though, it, is, disputed, where, this, took, place, see, origin, of, the, romanians, words, borrowed, in, this, way, tend, to, be, more, vernacular, compare, sf, r, i, to, end, with, s, v, r, i, to, commit, it, has, also, been, argued, that, slavic, borrowing, was, a, key, factor, in, the, development, of, and, as, a, separate, phoneme, even, before, the, 19th, century, romanian, came, in, contact, with, several, other, languages, notable, examples, of, lexical, borrowings, include, furthermore, during, the, habsburg, and, later, on, austrian, rule, of, banat, transylvania, and, bukovina, a, large, number, of, words, were, borrowed, from, austrian, high, german, in, particular, in, fields, such, as, the, military, administration, social, welfare, economy, etc, subsequently, german, terms, have, been, taken, out, of, science, and, technics, like, in, schiene, rail, tift, stift, peg, li, litze, braid, indril, schindel, shingle, tan, stanze, punch, aib, scheibe, washer, tang, stange, crossbar, igl, ziegel, tile, mirghel, schmirgelpapier, emery, paper, since, the, 19th, century, many, literary, or, learned, words, were, borrowed, from, the, other, romance, languages, especially, from, french, and, italian, for, example, birou, desk, office, avion, airplane, exploata, exploit, it, was, estimated, that, about, 38, of, words, in, romanian, are, of, french, and, or, italian, origin, in, many, cases, both, languages, and, adding, this, to, romanian, s, native, stock, about, 75, 85, of, romanian, words, can, be, traced, to, latin, the, use, of, these, romanianized, french, and, italian, learned, loans, has, tended, to, increase, at, the, expense, of, previous, loanwords, many, of, which, have, become, rare, or, fallen, out, of, use, as, second, or, third, languages, french, and, italian, themselves, are, better, known, in, romania, than, in, romania, s, neighbors, along, with, the, switch, to, the, latin, alphabet, in, moldova, the, re, latinization, of, the, vocabulary, has, tended, to, reinforce, the, latin, character, of, the, language, in, the, process, of, lexical, modernization, much, of, the, native, latin, stock, have, acquired, doublets, from, other, romance, languages, thus, forming, a, further, and, more, modern, and, literary, lexical, layer, typically, the, native, word, is, a, noun, and, the, learned, loan, is, an, adjective, some, examples, of, doublets, in, the, 20th, century, an, increasing, number, of, english, words, have, been, borrowed, such, as, gem, jam, interviu, interview, meci, match, manager, manager, fotbal, football, sandvi, sandwich, bi, ni, business, chec, cake, veceu, wc, tramvai, tramway, these, words, are, assigned, grammatical, gender, in, romanian, and, handled, according, to, romanian, rules, thus, the, manager, is, managerul, some, borrowings, for, example, in, the, computer, field, appear, to, have, awkward, perhaps, contrived, and, ludicrous, romanisation, such, as, cookie, uri, which, is, the, plural, of, the, internet, term, cookie, a, 1988, statistic, by, marius, sala, is, based, on, 2, 581, words, chosen, on, the, criteria, of, frequency, semantic, richness, and, productivity, which, also, contain, words, formed, on, the, territory, of, the, romanian, language, this, statistic, gives, the, percentages, below, if, the, analysis, is, restricted, to, a, core, vocabulary, of, 2, 500, frequent, semantically, rich, and, productive, words, then, the, latin, inheritance, comes, first, followed, by, romance, and, classical, latin, neologisms, whereas, the, slavic, borrowings, come, third, although, they, are, rarely, used, nowadays, the, romanian, calendar, used, to, have, the, traditional, romanian, month, names, unique, to, the, language, the, longest, word, in, romanian, is, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcaniconioz, with, 44, letters, but, the, longest, one, admitted, by, the, dic, ionarul, explicativ, al, limbii, rom, ne, explanatory, dictionary, of, the, romanian, language, dex, is, electroglotospectrografie, with, 25, letters, romanian, nouns, are, characterized, by, gender, feminine, masculine, and, neuter, and, declined, by, number, singular, and, plural, and, case, nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, and, vocative, the, articles, as, well, as, most, adjectives, and, pronouns, agree, in, gender, number, and, case, with, the, noun, they, modify, romanian, is, the, only, major, romance, language, where, definite, articles, are, enclitic, that, is, attached, to, the, end, of, the, noun, as, in, the, scandinavian, languages, bulgarian, and, albanian, instead, of, in, front, proclitic, they, were, formed, as, in, other, romance, languages, from, the, latin, demonstrative, pronouns, as, in, all, romance, languages, romanian, verbs, are, highly, inflected, for, person, number, tense, mood, and, voice, the, usual, word, order, in, sentences, is, subject, verb, object, svo, romanian, has, four, verbal, conjugations, which, further, split, into, ten, conjugation, patterns, romanian, verbs, are, conjugated, for, five, moods, indicative, conditional, optative, imperative, subjunctive, and, presumptive, and, four, non, finite, forms, infinitive, gerund, supine, and, participle, romanian, has, seven, vowels, i, u, e, o, and, a, additionally, and, y, may, appear, in, some, borrowed, words, arguably, the, diphthongs, e, a, and, o, a, are, also, part, of, the, phoneme, set, there, are, twenty, two, consonants, the, two, approximants, j, and, w, can, appear, before, or, after, any, vowel, creating, a, large, number, of, glide, vowel, sequences, which, are, strictly, speaking, not, diphthongs, in, final, positions, after, consonants, a, short, i, can, be, deleted, surfacing, only, as, the, palatalization, of, the, preceding, consonant, e, g, similarly, a, deleted, u, may, prompt, labialization, of, a, preceding, consonant, though, this, has, ceased, to, carry, any, morphological, meaning, owing, to, its, isolation, from, the, other, romance, languages, the, phonetic, evolution, of, romanian, was, quite, different, but, the, language, does, share, a, few, changes, with, italian, such, as, lat, cl, arus, rom, chi, r, ital, chi, aro, lat, clamare, rom, che, mare, ital, chia, mare, and, lat, gl, acia, gl, acies, rom, gh, a, ital, ghi, accia, ghi, accio, lat, un, gl, a, ungula, rom, un, ghi, e, ital, un, ghi, a, although, this, did, not, go, as, far, as, it, did, in, italian, with, other, similar, clusters, rom, pl, ce, ital, pi, ace, another, similarity, with, italian, is, the, change, from, or, to, or, lat, pax, pa, ce, m, rom, and, ital, pa, ce, lat, dul, ce, m, rom, dul, ce, ital, dol, ce, lat, ci, rcus, rom, ce, rc, ital, ci, rco, and, or, to, or, lat, ge, lu, rom, g, r, ital,

phonetically, lat, co, gn, atus, rom, cu, mn, at, dalm, co, mn, ut, and, ks, in, some, situations, lat, coxa, rom, c, ps, dalm, co, ps, a, among, the, notable, phonetic, changes, are, romanian, has, entirely, lost, latin, kw, qu, turning, it, either, into, p, lat, qu, attuor, rom, p, tru, four, cf, it, quattro, or, k, lat, qu, ando, rom, c, nd, when, lat, qu, ale, rom, c, re, which, the, first, written, record, about, a, romance, language, spoken, in, the, middle, ages, in, the, balkans, is, from, 587, a, vlach, muleteer, accompanying, the, byzantine, army, noticed, that, the, load, was,

military, expedition, by, comentiolus, and, priscus, against, the, avars, and, slovenes, the, oldest, surviving, written, text, in, romanian, is, a, letter, from, late, june, 1521, in, which, neac, u, of, c, mpulung, wrote, to, the, mayor, of, bra, ov, about, an, imminent, attack, of, the, turks, it, was, written, using, the, cyrillic, alphabet, like, most, early, romanian, writings, the, earliest, surviving, writing, in, latin, script, was, a, late, 16th, century, transylvanian, text, which, was, written, with, the, hungarian, alphabet, conventions, in, the, 18th, century, transylvanian, scholars, noted, the, latin, origin, of, romanian, and, adapted, the, latin, alphabet, to, the, romanian, language, using, some, orthographic, rules, from, italian, recognized, as, romanian, s, closest, relative, the, cyrillic, alphabet, remained, in, gradually, decreasing, use, until, 1860, when, romanian, writing, was, first, officially, regulated, in, the, soviet, republic, of, moldova, the, russian, derived, moldovan, cyrillic, alphabet, was, used, until, 1989, when, the, romanian, latin, alphabet, was, introduced, in, the, breakaway, territory, of, transnistria, the, cyrillic, alphabet, remains, in, use, the, romanian, alphabet, is, as, follows, k, q, w, and, y, not, part, of, the, native, alphabet, they, were, officially, introduced, in, the, romanian, alphabet, in, 1982, and, are, mostly, used, to, write, loanwords, like, kilogram, quasar, watt, and, yoga, the, romanian, alphabet, is, based, on, the, latin, script, with, five, additional, letters, formerly, there, were, as, many, as, 12, additional, letters, but, some, of, them, were, abolished, in, subsequent, reforms, also, until, the, early, 20th, century, a, breve, marker, was, used, which, survives, only, in, today, the, romanian, alphabet, is, largely, phonemic, however, the, letters, and, both, represent, the, same, close, central, unrounded, vowel, is, used, only, inside, words, is, used, at, the, beginning, or, the, end, of, non, compound, words, and, in, the, middle, of, compound, words, another, exception, from, a, completely, phonetic, writing, system, is, the, fact, that, vowels, and, their, respective, semivowels, are, not, distinguished, in, writing, in, dictionaries, the, distinction, is, marked, by, separating, the, entry, word, into, syllables, for, words, containing, a, hiatus, stressed, vowels, also, are, not, marked, in, writing, except, very, rarely, in, cases, where, by, misplacing, the, stress, a, word, might, change, its, meaning, and, if, the, meaning, is, not, obvious, from, the, context, for, example, trei, cop, i, means, three, children, while, trei, c, pii, means, three, copies, uses, of, punctuation, peculiar, to, romanian, are, in, 1993, new, spelling, rules, were, proposed, by, the, romanian, academy, in, 2000, the, moldovan, academy, recommended, adopting, the, same, spelling, rules, and, in, 2010, the, academy, launched, a, schedule, for, the, transition, to, the, new, rules, that, was, intended, to, be, completed, by, publications, in, 2011, on, 17, october, 2016, the, moldovan, minister, of, education, signed, order, no, 872, adopting, the, revised, spelling, rules, as, recommended, by, the, moldovan, academy, of, sciences, and, giving, the, following, two, school, years, as, a, transition, period, thus, the, spelling, used, by, institutions, under, moldova, s, ministry, of, education, has, been, brought, in, line, with, the, romanian, academy, s, 1993, recommendation, this, order, however, did, not, apply, to, other, government, institutions, and, law, 3462, of, 1989, which, provided, for, the, means, of, transliterating, cyrillic, to, latin, has, not, been, amended, to, reflect, the, ministry, of, education, s, changes, either, thus, most, moldovan, government, institutions, along, with, most, moldovans, prefer, to, use, the, spelling, adopted, in, 1989, when, the, use, of, latin, script, became, official, the, sentence, in, contemporary, romanian, words, inherited, directly, from, latin, are, highlighted, the, same, sentence, with, french, and, italian, loanwords, highlighted, instead, the, sentence, rewritten, to, exclude, french, and, italian, loanwords, slavic, loanwords, are, highlighted, the, sentence, rewritten, to, exclude, all, loanwords, the, meaning, is,
