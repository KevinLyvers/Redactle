common, law, dating, back, to, the, 16th, century, treated, domestic, violence, as, a, crime, against, the, community, rather, than, against, the, individual, woman, by, charging, wife, beating, as, a, breach, of, the, peace, wives, had, the, right, to, seek, redress, in, the, form, of, a, peace, bond, from, a, local, justice, of, the, peace, procedures, were, informal, and, off, the, record, and, no, legal, guidance, specified, the, standard, of, proof, or, degree, of, violence, which, would, suffice, for, a, conviction, the, two, typical, sentences, were, forcing, a, husband, to, post, bond, or, forcing, him, to, stake, pledges, from, his, associates, to, guarantee, good, behavior, in, the, future, beatings, could, also, be, formally, charged, as, assault, although, such,

recourse, available, to, battered, women, increasingly, became, divorce, on, grounds, of, cruelty, and, suing, for, assault, this, placed, a, greater, burden, of, proof, on, the, woman, as, she, needed, to, demonstrate, to, a, court, that, her, life, was, at, risk, in, 1824, the, mississippi, supreme, court, citing, the, rule, of, thumb, established, a, positive, right, to, wife, beating, in, state, v, bradley, a, precedent, which, would, hold, sway, in, common, law, for, decades, to, come, political, agitation, and, the, first, wave, feminist, movement, during, the, 19th, century, led, to, changes, in, both, popular, opinion, and, legislation, regarding, domestic, violence, within, the, uk, the, us, and, other, countries, in, 1850, tennessee, became, the, first, state, in, the, us, to, explicitly, outlaw, wife, beating, other, states, soon, followed, in, 1871, the, tide, of, legal, opinion, began, to, turn, against, the, idea, of, a, right, to, wife, beating, as, courts, in,

an, abusive, husband, by, the, end, of, the, 1870s, most, courts, in, the, us, had, rejected, a, claimed, right, of, husbands, to, physically, discipline, their, wives, in, the, early, 20th, century, paternalistic, judges, regularly, protected, perpetrators, of, domestic, violence, in, order, to, reinforce, gender, norms, within, the, family, in, divorce, and, criminal, domestic, violence, cases, judges, would, levy, harsh, punishments, against, male, perpetrators, but, when, the, gender, roles, were, reversed, they, would, often, give, little, to, no, punishment, to, female, perpetrators, by, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, common, for, police, to, intervene, in, cases, of, domestic, violence, in, the, us, but, arrests, remained, rare, in, most, legal, systems, around, the, world, domestic, violence, has, been, addressed, only, from, the, 1990s, onward, indeed, before, the, late, 20th, century, in, most, countries, there, was, very, little, protection, in, law, or, in, practice, against, domestic, violence, in, 1993, the, un, published, strategies, for, confronting, domestic, violence, a, resource, manual, this, publication, urged, countries, around, the, world, to, treat, domestic, violence, as, a, criminal, act, stated, that, the, right, to, a, private, family, life, does, not, include, the, right, to, abuse, family, members, and, acknowledged, that, at, the, time, of, its, writing, most, legal, systems, considered, domestic, violence, to, be, largely, outside, the, scope, of, the, law, describing, the, situation, at, that, time, as, follows, physical, discipline, of, children, is, allowed, and, indeed, encouraged, in, many, legal, systems, and, a, large, number, of, countries, allow, moderate, physical, chastisement, of, a, wife, or, if, they, do, not, do, so, now, have, done, so, within, the, last, 100, years, again, most, legal, systems, fail, to, criminalize, circumstances, where, a, wife, is, forced, to, have, sexual, relations, with, her, husband, against, her, will, indeed, in, the, case, of, violence, against, wives, there, is, a, widespread, belief, that, women, provoke, can, tolerate, or, even, enjoy, a, certain, level, of, violence, from, their, spouses, in, recent, decades, there, has, been, a, call, for, the, end, of, legal, impunity, for, domestic, violence, an, impunity, often, based, on, the, idea, that, such,

these, forms, of, violence, at, para, 219, it, states, there, are, many, examples, from, past, practice, in, council, of, europe, member, states, that, show, that, exceptions, to, the, prosecution, of, such, cases, were, made, either, in, law, or, in, practice, if, victim, and, perpetrator, were, for, example, married, to, each, other, or, had, been, in, a, relationship, the, most, prominent, example, is, rape, within, marriage, which, for, a, long, time, had, not, been, recognised, as, rape, because, of, the, relationship, between, victim, and, perpetrator, there, has, been, increased,

for, human, rights, watch, argued, that, there, are, similarities, between, the, dynamics, of, crimes, of, passion, and, honor, killings, stating, that, crimes, of, passion, have, a, similar, dynamic, in, that, the, women, are, killed, by, male, family, members, and, the, crimes, are, perceived, as, excusable, or, understandable, historically, children, had, few, protections, from, violence, by, their, parents, and, in, many, parts, of, the, world, this, is, still, the, case, for, example, in, ancient, rome, a, father, could, legally, kill, his, children, many, cultures, have, allowed,

factors, in, domestic, violence, is, a, belief, that, abuse, whether, physical, or, verbal, is, acceptable, other, risk, factors, include, substance, abuse, lack, of, education, mental, health, problems, lack, of, coping, skills, childhood, abuse, and, excessive, dependence, on, the, abuser, an, overriding, motive, for, committing, acts, of, domestic, and, interpersonal, violence, in, a, relationship, is, to, establish, and, maintain, relationships, based, on, power, and, control, over, victims, batterers, morality, is, out, of, step, with, the, law, and, society, s, standards, research, shows, the, key, issue, for, perpetrators, of, abuse, is, their, conscious, and, deliberate, decision, to, offend, in, the, pursuit, of, self, gratification, men, who, perpetrate, violence, have, specific, characteristics, they, are, narcissistic, they, willfully, lack, empathy, and, they, choose, to, treat, their, needs, as, more, important, than, others, perpetrators, psychologically, manipulate, their, victim, to, believe, their, abuse, and, violence, is, caused, by, the, victim, s, inadequacy, as, a, wife, a, lover, or, as, a, human, being, rather, than, the, perpetrators, selfish, desire, for, power, and, control, over, them, lenore, e, walker, presented, the, model, of, a, cycle, of, abuse, which, consists, of, four, phases, first, there, is, a, buildup, to, abuse, when, tension, rises, until, a, domestic, violence, incident, ensues, during, the, reconciliation, stage, the, abuser, may, be, kind, and, loving, and, then, there, is, a, period, of, calm, when, the, situation, is, calm, the, abused, person, may, be, hopeful, that, the, situation, will, change, then, tensions, begin, to, build, and, the, cycle, starts, again, a, common, aspect, among, abusers, is, that, they, witnessed, abuse, in, their, childhood, they, were, participants, in, a, chain, of, intergenerational, cycles, of, domestic, violence, that, does, not, mean, conversely, that, if, a, child, witnesses, or, is, subject, to, violence, that, they, will, become, abusers, understanding, and, breaking, the, intergenerational, abuse, patterns, may, do, more, to, reduce, domestic, violence, than, other, remedies, for, managing, the, abuse, responses, that, focus, on, children, suggest, that, experiences, throughout, life, influence, an, individual, s, propensity, to, engage, in, family, violence, either, as, a, victim, or, as, a, perpetrator, researchers, supporting, this, theory, suggest, it, is, useful, to, think, of, three, sources, of, domestic, violence, childhood, socialization, previous, experiences, in, couple, relationships, during, adolescence, and, levels, of, strain, in, a, person, s, current, life, people, who, observe, their, parents, abusing, each, other, or, who, were, themselves, abused, may, incorporate, abuse, into, their, behaviour, within, relationships, that, they, establish, as, adults, research, indicates, that, the, more, children, are, physically, punished, the, more, likely, they, will, be, as, adults, to, act, violently, towards, family, members, including, intimate, partners, people, who, are, spanked, more, as, children, are, more, likely, as, adults, to, approve, of, hitting, a, partner, and, also, experience, more, marital, conflict, and, feelings, of, anger, in, general, a, number, of, studies, have, found, physical, punishment, to, be, associated, with, higher, levels, of, aggression, against, parents, siblings, peers, and, spouses, even, when, controlling, for, other, factors, while, these, associations, do, not, prove, a, causal, relationship, a, number, of, longitudinal, studies, suggest, that, the, experience, of, physical, punishment, does, have, a, direct, causal, effect, on, later, aggressive, behaviors, such, research, has, shown, that, corporal, punishment, of, children, e, g, smacking, slapping, or, spanking, predicts, weaker, internalisation, of, values, such, as, empathy, altruism, and, resistance, to, temptation, along, with, more, antisocial, behavior, including, dating, violence, in, some, patrilineal, societies, around, the, world, a, young, bride, moves, with, the, family, of, her, husband, as, a, new, girl, in, the, home, she, starts, as, having, the, lowest, or, among, the, lowest, position, in, the, family, is, often, subjected, to, violence, and, abuse, and, is, in, particular, strongly, controlled, by, the, parents, in, law, with, the, arrival, of, the, daughter, in, law, in, the, family, the, mother, in, law, s, status, is, elevated, and, she, now, has, often, for, the, first, time, in, her, life, substantial, power, over, someone, else, and, this, family, system, itself, tends, to, produce, a, cycle, of, violence, in, which, the, formerly, abused, bride, becomes, the, abusing, mother, in, law, to, her, new, daughter, in, law, amnesty, international, writes, that, in, tajikistan, it, is, almost, an, initiation, ritual, for, the, mother, in, law, to, put, her, daughter, in, law, through, the, same, torments, she, went, through, herself, as, a, young, wife, these, factors, include, genetics, and, brain, dysfunction, and, are, studied, by, neuroscience, psychological, theories, focus, on, personality, traits, and, mental, characteristics, of, the, offender, personality, traits, include, sudden, bursts, of, anger, poor, impulse, control, and, poor, self, esteem, various, theories, suggest, that, psychopathology, is, a, factor, and, that, abuse, experienced, as, a, child, leads, some, people, to, be, more, violent, as, adults, correlation, has, been, found, between, juvenile, delinquency, and, domestic, violence, in, adulthood, studies, have, found, a, high, incidence, of, psychopathology, among, domestic, abusers, for, instance, some, research, suggests, that, about, 80, of, both, court, referred, and, self, referred, men, in, these, domestic, violence, studies, exhibited, diagnosable, psychopathology, typically, personality, disorders, the, estimate, of, personality, disorders, in, the, general, population, would, be, more, in, the, 15, 20, range, as, violence, becomes, more, severe, and, chronic, in, the, relationship, the, likelihood, of, psychopathology, in, these, men, approaches, 100, dutton, has, suggested, a, psychological, profile, of, men, who, abuse, their, wives, arguing, that, they, have, borderline, personalities, that, are, developed, early, in, life, however, these, psychological, theories, are, disputed, gelles, suggests, that, psychological, theories, are, limited, and, points, out, that, other, researchers, have, found, that, only, 10, or, less, fit, this, psychological, profile, he, argues, that, social, factors, are, important, while, personality, traits, mental, illness, or, psychopathy, are, lesser, factors, an, evolutionary, psychological, explanation, of, domestic, violence, is, that, it, represents, male, attempts, to, control, female, reproduction, and, ensure, sexual, exclusivity, violence, related, to, extramarital, relations, is, seen, as, justified, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, for, instance, a, survey, in, diyarbakir, turkey, found, that, when, asked, the, appropriate, punishment, for, a, woman, who, has, committed, adultery, 37, of, respondents, said, she, should, be, killed, while, 21, said, her, nose, or, ears, should, be, cut, off, a, 1997, report, suggested, that, domestic, abusers, display, higher, than, average, mate, retention, behaviors, which, are, attempts, to, maintain, the, relationship, with, the, partner, the, report, had, stated, that, men, more, than, women, were, using, resource, display, submission, and, debasement, and, intrasexual, threats, to, retain, their, mates, social, theories, look, at, external, factors, in, the, offender, s, environment, such, as, family, structure, stress, social, learning, and, includes, rational, choice, theories, social, learning, theory, suggests, that, people, learn, from, observing, and, modeling, after, others, behavior, with, positive, reinforcement, the, behavior, continues, if, one, observes, violent, behavior, one, is, more, likely, to, imitate, it, if, there, are, no, negative, consequences, e, g, the, victim, accepts, the, violence, with, submission, then, the, behavior, will, likely, continue, resource, theory, was, suggested, by, william, goode, in, 1971, women, who, are, most, dependent, on, their, spouse, for, economic, well, being, e, g, homemakers, housewives, women, with, disability, women, who, are, unemployed, and, are, the, primary, caregiver, to, their, children, fear, the, increased, financial, burden, if, they, leave, their, marriage, dependency, means, that, they, have, fewer, options, and, few, resources, to, help, them, cope, with, or, change, their, spouse, s, behavior, couples, that, share, power, equally, experience, a, lower, incidence, of, conflict, and, when, conflict, does, arise, are, less, likely, to, resort, to, violence, if, one, spouse, desires, control, and, power, in, the, relationship, the, spouse, may, resort, to, abuse, this, may, include, coercion, and, threats, intimidation, emotional, abuse, economic, abuse, isolation, making, light, of, the, situation, and, blaming, the, spouse, using, children, threatening, to, take, them, away, and, behaving, as, master, of, the, castle, another, report, has, stated, that, domestic, abusers, may, be, blinded, by, rage, and, therefore, see, themselves, as, the, victim, when, it, comes, to, domestically, abusing, their, partner, due, to, mainly, negative, emotions, and, difficulties, in, communications, between, partners, the, abusers, believe, they, have, been, wronged, and, therefore, psychologically, they, make, themselves, be, seen, as, the, victim, stress, may, be, increased, when, a, person, is, living, in, a, family, situation, with, increased, pressures, social, stresses, due, to, inadequate, finances, or, other, such, problems, in, a, family, may, further, increase, tensions, violence, is, not, always, caused, by, stress, but, may, be, one, way, that, some, people, respond, to, stress, families, and, couples, in, poverty, may, be, more, likely, to, experience, domestic, violence, due, to, increased, stress, and, conflicts, about, finances, and, other, aspects, some, speculate, that, poverty, may, hinder, a, man, s, ability, to, live, up, to, his, idea, of, successful, manhood, thus, he, fears, losing, honor, and, respect, a, theory, suggests, that, when, he, is, unable, to, economically, support, his, wife, and, maintain, control, he, may, turn, to, misogyny, substance, abuse, and, crime, as, ways, to, express, masculinity, same, sex, relationships, may, experience, similar, social, stressors, additionally, violence, in, same, sex, relationships, has, been, linked, to, internalized, homophobia, which, contributed, to, low, self, esteem, and, anger, in, both, the, perpetrator, and, victim, internalized, homophobia, also, appears, to, be, a, barrier, in, victims, seeking, help, similarly, heterosexism, can, play, a, key, role, in, domestic, violence, in, the, lgbt, community, as, a, social, ideology, that, implies, heterosexuality, is, normative, morally, superior, and, better, than, heterosexism, can, hinder, services, and, lead, to, an, unhealthy, self, image, in, sexual, minorities, heterosexism, in, legal, and, medical, institutions, can, be, seen, in, instances, of, discrimination, biases, and, insensitivity, toward, sexual, orientation, for, example, as, of, 2006, seven, states, explicitly, denied, lgbt, individuals, the, ability, to, apply, for, protective, orders, proliferating, ideas, of, lgbt, subjugation, which, is, tied, to, feelings, of, anger, and, powerlessness, power, and, control, in, abusive, relationships, is, the, way, that, abusers, exert, physical, sexual, and, other, forms, of, abuse, to, gain, control, within, relationships, a, causalist, view, of, domestic, violence, is, that, it, is, a, strategy, to, gain, or, maintain, power, and, control, over, the, victim, this, view, is, in, alignment, with, bancroft, s, cost, benefit, theory, that, abuse, rewards, the, perpetrator, in, ways, other, than, or, in, addition, to, simply, exercising, power, over, his, or, her, target, s, he, cites, evidence, in, support, of, his, argument, that, in, most, cases, abusers, are, quite, capable, of, exercising, control, over, themselves, but, choose, not, to, do, so, for, various, reasons, sometimes, one, person, seeks, complete, power, and, control, over, their, partner, and, uses, different, ways, to, achieve, this, including, resorting, to, physical, violence, the, perpetrator, attempts, to, control, all, aspects, of, the, victim, s, life, such, as, their, social, personal, professional, and, financial, decisions, questions, of, power, and, control, are, integral, to, the, widely, utilized, duluth, domestic, abuse, intervention, project, they, developed, the, power, and, control, wheel, to, illustrate, this, it, has, power, and, control, at, the, center, surrounded, by, spokes, which, represent, techniques, used, the, titles, of, the, spokes, include, coercion, and, threats, intimidation, emotional, abuse, isolation, minimizing, denying, and, blaming, using, children, economic, abuse, and, privilege, critics, of, this, model, argue, that, it, ignores, research, linking, domestic, violence, to, substance, abuse, and, psychological, problems, some, modern, research, into, the, patterns, in, domestic, violence, has, found, that, women, are, more, likely, to, be, physically, abusive, towards, their, partner, in, relationships, in, which, only, one, partner, is, violent, which, draws, the, effectiveness, of, using, concepts, like, male, privilege, to, treat, domestic, violence, into, question, some, modern, research, into, predictors, of, injury, from, domestic, violence, suggests, that, the, strongest, predictor, of, injury, by, domestic, violence, is, participation, in, reciprocal, domestic, violence, non, subordination, theory, sometimes, called, dominance, theory, is, an, area, of, feminist, legal, theory, that, focuses, on, the, power, differential, between, men, and, women, non, subordination, theory, takes, the, position, that, society, and, particularly, men, in, society, use, sex, differences, between, men, and, women, to, perpetuate, this, power, imbalance, unlike, other, topics, within, feminist, legal, theory, non, subordination, theory, focuses, specifically, on, certain, sexual, behaviors, including, control, of, women, s, sexuality, sexual, harassment, pornography, and, violence, against, women, generally, catharine, mackinnon, argues, that, non, subordination, theory, best, addresses, these, particular, issues, because, they, affect, almost, exclusively, women, mackinnon, advocates, for, non, subordination, theory, over, other, theories, like, formal, equality, substantive, equality, and, difference, theory, because, sexual, violence, and, other, forms, of, violence, against, women, are, not, a, question, of, sameness, and, difference, but, rather, are, best, viewed, as, more, central, inequalities, for, women, though, non, subordination, theory, has, been, discussed, at, great, length, in, evaluating, various, forms, of, sexual, violence, against, women, it, also, serves, as, a, basis, for, understanding, domestic, violence, and, why, it, occurs, non, subordination, theory, tackles, the, issue, of, domestic, violence, as, a, subset, of, the, broader, problem, of, violence, against, women, because, victims, are, overwhelmingly, female, proponents, of, non, subordination, theory, propose, several, reasons, why, it, works, best, to, explain, domestic, violence, first, there, are, certain, recurring, patterns, in, domestic, violence, that, indicate, it, is, not, the, result, of, intense, anger, or, arguments, but, rather, is, a, form, of, subordination, this, is, evidenced, in, part, by, the, fact, that, domestic, violence, victims, are, typically, abused, in, a, variety, of, situations, and, by, a, variety, of, means, for, example, victims, are, sometimes, beaten, after, they, have, been, sleeping, or, have, been, separated, from, the, batterer, and, often, the, abuse, takes, on, a, financial, or, emotional, form, in, addition, to, physical, abuse, supporters, of, non, subordination, theory, use, these, examples, to, dispel, the, notion, that, battering, is, always, the, result, of, heat, of, the, moment, anger, or, intense, arguments, occur, also, batterers, often, employ, manipulative, and, deliberate, tactics, when, abusing, their, victims, which, can, range, from, searching, for, and, destroying, a, treasured, object, of, hers, to, striking, her, in, areas, of, her, body, that, do, not, show, bruises, e, g, her, scalp, or, in, areas, where, she, would, be, embarrassed, to, show, others, her, bruises, these, behaviors, can, be, even, more, useful, to, a, batterer, when, the, batterer, and, the, victim, share, children, because, the, batterer, often, controls, the, family, s, financial, assets, making, the, victim, less, likely, to, leave, if, it, would, put, her, children, at, risk, professor, martha, mahoney, of, the, university, of, miami, school, of, law, also, points, to, separation, assault, a, phenomenon, where, a, batterer, further, assaults, a, victim, who, is, attempting, or, has, attempted, to, leave, an, abusive, relationship, as, additional, evidence, that, dv, is, used, to, subordinate, victims, to, their, batterers, a, batterer, s, unwillingness, to, allow, the, victim, to, leave, the, relationship, substantiates, the, idea, that, violence, is, being, used, to, force, the, victim, to, continue, to, fulfill, the, batterer, s, wishes, that, she, obey, him, non, subordination, theorists, argue, that, all, of, these, actions, the, variety, of, abusive, behaviors, and, settings, exploiting, the, victim, s, children, and, assault, upon, separation, suggest, a, larger, problem, than, merely, an, inability, to, properly, manage, anger, though, anger, may, be, a, byproduct, of, these, behaviors, the, purpose, of, these, actions, is, to, keep, the, victim, and, sometimes, the, entire, family, subordinate, to, the, batterer, according, to, non, subordination, theory, a, second, rationale, for, using, non, subordination, theory, to, explain, domestic, violence, is, that, the, frequency, with, which, it, occurs, overpowers, the, idea, that, it, is, merely, the, result, of, a, batterer, s, anger, professor, mahoney, explains, that, because, of, the, sensationalism, generated, in, media, coverage, of, particularly, horrific, domestic, violence, cases, it, is, difficult, for, people, to, conceptualize, how, frequently, domestic, violence, happens, in, society, however, domestic, violence, is, a, regular, occurrence, experienced, by, up, to, one, half, of, people, in, the, us, and, an, overwhelming, number, of, victims, are, female, the, sheer, number, of, domestic, violence, victims, in, the, us, suggests, that, it, is, not, merely, the, result, of, intimate, partners, who, cannot, control, their, anger, non, subordination, theory, contends, that, it, is, the, batterer, s, desire, to, subordinate, the, victim, not, his, uncountainable, anger, which, explains, the, frequency, of, domestic, violence, non, subordination, theorists, argue, that, other, forms, of, feminist, legal, theory, do, not, offer, any, explanation, for, the, phenomenon, of, domestic, violence, generally, or, the, frequency, with, which, it, occurs, critics, of, non, subordination, theory, complain, that, it, offers, no, solutions, to, the, problems, it, points, out, for, example, proponents, of, non, subordination, theory, criticize, certain, approaches, that, have, been, taken, to, address, domestic, violence, in, the, legal, system, such, as, mandatory, arrest, or, prosecution, policies, these, policies, take, discretion, away, from, law, enforcement, by, forcing, police, officers, to, arrest, suspected, domestic, violence, offenders, and, prosecutors, to, prosecute, those, cases, there, is, a, lot, of, discourse, surrounding, mandatory, arrest, opponents, argue, that, it, undermines, a, victim, s, autonomy, discourages, the, empowerment, of, women, by, discounting, other, resources, available, and, puts, victims, at, more, risk, for, domestic, abuse, states, that, have, implemented, mandatory, arrest, laws, have, 60, higher, homicide, rates, which, have, been, shown, to, be, consistent, with, the, decline, in, reporting, rates, advocates, of, these, policies, contend, that, the, criminal, justice, system, is, sometimes, the, only, way, to, reach, victims, of, domestic, violence, and, that, if, an, offender, knows, he, will, be, arrested, it, will, deter, future, domestic, violence, conduct, people, who, endorse, non, subordination, theory, argue, that, these, policies, only, serve, to, further, subordinate, women, by, forcing, them, to, take, a, certain, course, of, action, thus, compounding, the, trauma, they, experienced, during, the, abuse, however, non, subordination, theory, itself, offers, no, better, or, more, appropriate, solutions, which, is, why, some, scholars, argue, that, other, forms, of, feminist, legal, theory, are, more, appropriate, to, address, issues, of, domestic, and, sexual, violence, domestic, violence, typically, co, occurs, with, alcohol, abuse, alcohol, use, has, been, reported, as, a, factor, by, two, thirds, of, domestic, abuse, victims, moderate, drinkers, are, more, frequently, engaged, in, intimate, violence, than, are, light, drinkers, and, abstainers, however, generally, it, is, heavy, or, binge, drinkers, who, are, involved, in, the, most, chronic, and, serious, forms, of, aggression, the, odds, frequency, and, severity, of, physical, attacks, are, all, positively, correlated, with, alcohol, use, in, turn, violence, decreases, after, behavioral, marital, alcoholism, treatment, there, are, studies, providing, evidence, of, a, link, between, domestic, violence, and, cruelty, to, animals, a, large, national, survey, by, the, norwegian, centre, for, violence, and, traumatic, stress, studies, found, a, substantial, overlap, between, companion, animal, abuse, and, child, abuse, and, that, cruelty, to, animals, most, frequently, co, occurred, with, psychological, abuse, and, less, severe, forms, of, physical, child, abuse, which, resonates, with, conceptualizations, of, domestic, abuse, as, an, ongoing, pattern, of, psychological, abuse, and, coercive, control, how, domestic, violence, is, viewed, varies, from, person, to, person, and, from, culture, to, culture, but, in, many, places, outside, the, west, the, concept, is, very, poorly, understood, in, some, countries, the, concept, is, even, widely, accepted, or, completely, suppressed, this, is, because, in, most, of, these, countries, the, relation, between, the, husband, and, wife, is, not, considered, one, of, equals, but, instead, one, in, which, the, wife, must, submit, herself, to, the, husband, this, is, codified, in, the, laws, of, some, countries, for, example, in, yemen, marriage, regulations, state, that, a, wife, must, obey, her, husband, and, must, not, leave, home, without, his, permission, according, to, violence, against, women, in, families, and, relationships, globally, wife, beating, is, seen, as, justified, in, some, circumstances, by, a, majority, of, the, population, in, various, countries, most, commonly, in, situations, of, actual, or, suspected, infidelity, by, wives, or, their, disobedience, toward, a, husband, or, partner, these, violent, acts, against, a, wife, are, often, not, considered, a, form, of, abuse, by, society, both, men, and, women, but, are, considered, to, have, been, provoked, by, the, behavior, of, the, wife, who, is, seen, as, being, at, fault, in, many, places, extreme, acts, such, as, honor, killings, are, also, approved, by, a, high, section, of, the, society, in, one, survey, 33, 4, of, teenagers, in, jordan, s, capital, city, amman, approved, of, honor, killings, this, survey, was, carried, in, the, capital, of, jordan, which, is, much, more, liberal, than, other, parts, of, the, country, the, researchers, said, that, we, would, expect, that, in, the, more, rural, and, traditional, parts, of, jordan, support, for, honor, killings, would, be, even, higher, in, a, 2012, news, story, the, washington, post, reported, the, reuters, trust, law, group, named, india, one, of, the, worst, countries, in, the, world, for, women, this, year, partly, because, there, is, often, seen, as, deserved, a, 2012, report, by, unicef, found, that, 57, percent, of, indian, boys, and, 53, percent, of, girls, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 19, think, wife, beating, is, justified, in, conservative, cultures, a, wife, dressing, in, attire, deemed, insufficiently, modest, can, suffer, serious, violence, at, the, hands, of, her, husband, or, relatives, with, such, violent, responses, seen, as, appropriate, by, most, of, the, society, in, a, survey, 62, 8, of, women, in, afghanistan, said, that, a, husband, is, justified, in, beating, his, wife, if, she, wears, inappropriate, clothes, according, to, antonia, parvanova, one, of, the, difficulties, of, dealing, legally, with, the, issue, of, domestic, violence, is, that, men, in, many, male, dominated, societies, do, not, understand, that, inflicting, violence, against, their, wives, is, against, the, law, she, said, referring, to, a, case, that, occurred, in, bulgaria, a, husband, was, tried, for, severely, beating, his, wife, and, when, the, judge, asked, him, if, he, understood, what, he, did, and, if, he, s, sorry, the, husband, said, but, she, s, my, wife, he, doesn, t, even, understand, that, he, has, no, right, to, beat, her, the, un, population, fund, writes, that, in, some, developing, countries, practices, that, subjugate, and, harm, women, such, as, wife, beating, killings, in, the, name, of, honour, female, genital, mutilation, cutting, and, dowry, deaths, are, condoned, as, being, part, of, the, natural, order, of, things, strong, views, among, the, population, in, certain, societies, that, reconciliation, is, more, appropriate, than, punishment, in, cases, of, domestic, violence, are, also, another, cause, of, legal, impunity, a, study, found, that, 64, of, public, officials, in, colombia, said, that, if, it, were, in, their, hands, to, solve, a, case, of, intimate, partner, violence, the, action, they, would, take, would, be, to, encourage, the, parties, to, reconcile, victim, blaming, is, also, prevalent, in, many, societies, including, in, western, countries, a, 2010, eurobarometer, poll, found, that, 52, of, respondents, agreed, with, the, assertion, that, the, provocative, behaviour, of, women, was, a, cause, of, violence, against, women, with, respondents, in, cyprus, denmark, estonia, finland, latvia, lithuania, malta, and, slovenia, being, most, likely, to, agree, with, the, assertion, more, than, 70, in, each, of, these, countries, there, is, controversy, regarding, the, influence, of, religion, on, domestic, violence, judaism, christianity, and, islam, have, traditionally, supported, male, dominant, households, and, socially, sanctioned, violence, against, women, has, been, persistent, since, ancient, times, views, on, the, influence, of, islam, on, domestic, violence, differ, while, some, authors, argue, that, islam, is, connected, to, violence, against, women, especially, in, the, form, of, honor, killings, others, such, as, tahira, shahid, khan, a, professor, specializing, in, women, s, issues, at, the, aga, khan, university, in, pakistan, argue, that, it, is, the, domination, of, men, and, inferior, status, of, women, in, society, that, lead, to, these, acts, not, the, religion, itself, public, such, as, through, the, media, and, political, discourse, debating, the, relation, between, islam, immigration, and, violence, against, women, is, highly, controversial, in, many, western, countries, among, christians, men, and, women, who, attend, church, more, frequently, are, less, likely, to, commit, domestic, violence, against, their, partners, the, effect, of, church, attendance, is, not, caused, by, increased, levels, of, social, support, and, community, integration, which, are, not, significantly, related, to, the, perpetration, of, domestic, violence, in, addition, even, when, variations, in, psychological, problems, namely, depressive, symptoms, low, self, esteem, and, alcoholism, are, accounted, for, the, salutary, effect, of, church, attendance, remains, people, who, are, theologically, conservative, are, no, more, likely, to, commit, domestic, violence, however, highly, conservative, men, are, significantly, more, likely, to, commit, domestic, violence, when, their, partners, are, much, more, liberal, than, them, catholic, teaching, on, divorce, has, led, women, to, fear, leaving, abusive, marriages, however, catholic, bishops, specifically, state, that, no, person, is, obliged, to, remain, within, an, abusive, marriage, medieval, jewish, authorities, differed, on, the, subject, of, wife, beating, most, rabbis, living, in, islamic, lands, allowed, it, as, a, tool, of, discipline, while, those, from, christian, france, and, germany, generally, saw, it, as, justifying, immediate, divorce, local, customs, and, traditions, are, often, responsible, for, maintaining, certain, forms, of, domestic, violence, such, customs, and, traditions, include, son, preference, the, desire, of, a, family, to, have, a, boy, and, not, a, girl, which, is, strongly, prevalent, in, parts, of, asia, which, can, lead, to, abuse, and, neglect, of, girls, by, disappointed, family, members, child, and, forced, marriages, dowry, the, hierarchic, caste, system, which, stigmatizes, lower, castes, and, untouchables, leading, to, discrimination, and, restricted, opportunities, of, the, females, and, thus, making, them, more, vulnerable, to, abuse, strict, dress, codes, for, women, that, may, be, enforced, through, violence, by, family, members, strong, requirement, of, female, virginity, before, the, wedding, and, violence, related, to, non, conforming, women, and, girls, taboos, about, menstruation, leading, to, females, being, isolated, and, shunned, during, the, time, of, menstruation, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, ideologies, of, marital, conjugal, rights, to, sex, which, justify, marital, rape, the, importance, given, to, family, honor, a, study, reported, in, 2018, that, in, sub, saharan, africa, 38, of, women, justified, the, abuse, compared, to, europe, which, had, 29, and, south, asia, having, the, highest, number, with, 47, of, women, justifying, the, abuse, these, high, rates, could, be, due, to, the, fact, that, in, lower, economically, developed, countries, women, are, subject, to, societal, norms, and, are, subject, to, tradition, so, therefore, are, to, scared, to, go, against, that, tradition, as, they, would, receive, backlash, whereas, in, higher, econmocially, developed, countries, women, are, more, educated, and, therefore, will, not, conform, to, those, traditions, which, restrict, their, basic, human, rights, according, to, a, 2003, report, by, human, rights, watch, customs, such, as, the, payment, of, bride, price, payment, made, by, a, man, to, the, family, of, a, woman, he, wishes, to, marry, whereby, a, man, essentially, purchases, his, wife, s, sexual, favors, and, reproductive, capacity, underscore, men, s, socially, sanctioned, entitlement, to, dictate, the, terms, of, sex, and, to, use, force, to, do, so, in, recent, years, there, has, been, progress, in, the, area, of, addressing, customary, practices, that, endanger, women, with, laws, being, enacted, in, several, countries, the, inter, african, committee, on, traditional, practices, affecting, the, health, of, women, and, children, is, an, ngo, which, works, on, changing, social, values, raising, consciousness, and, enacting, laws, against, harmful, traditions, which, affect, the, health, of, women, and, children, in, africa, laws, were, also, enacted, in, some, countries, for, example, the, 2004, criminal, code, of, ethiopia, has, a, chapter, on, harmful, traditional, practices, chapter, iii, crimes, committed, against, life, person, and, health, through, harmful, traditional, practices, in, addition, the, council, of, europe, adopted, the, istanbul, convention, which, requires, the, states, that, ratify, it, to, create, and, fully, adjudicate, laws, against, acts, of, violence, previously, condoned, by, traditional, culture, custom, in, the, name, of, honor, or, to, correct, what, is, deemed, unacceptable, behavior, the, un, created, the, handbook, on, effective, police, responses, to, violence, against, women, to, provide, guidelines, to, address, and, manage, violence, through, the, creation, of, effective, laws, law, enforcement, policies, and, practices, and, community, activities, to, break, down, societal, norms, that, condone, violence, criminalize, it, and, create, effect, support, systems, for, survivors, of, violence, in, cultures, where, the, police, and, legal, authorities, have, a, reputation, of, corruption, and, abusive, practices, victims, of, domestic, violence, are, often, reluctant, to, turn, to, formal, help, violence, on, women, is, sometimes, justified, by, women, themselves, for, example, in, mali, 60, of, women, with, no, education, just, over, half, of, women, with, a, primary, education, and, fewer, than, 40, of, women, with, a, secondary, or, higher, education, believe, that, husbands, have, the, right, to, use, violence, for, corrective, reasons, acceptance, of, domestic, violence, has, decreased, in, some, countries, for, example, in, nigeria, where, 62, 4, of, women, supported, domestic, violence, in, 2003, 45, 7, in, 2008, and, 37, 1, in, 2013, however, in, some, cases, the, acceptance, increased, for, example, in, zimbabwe, where, 53, of, women, justify, wife, beating, in, nigeria, education, place, of, residence, wealth, index, ethnic, affiliation, religious, affiliation, women, s, autonomy, in, household, decision, making, and, frequency, of, listening, to, the, radio, or, watching, television, significantly, influence, women, s, opinions, about, domestic, violence, in, the, opinion, of, adolescents, aged, 15, to, 19, 14, of, boys, in, kazakhstan, but, 9, of, girls, believed, wife, beating, is, justified, and, in, cambodia, 25, of, boys, and, 42, of, girls, think, it, is, justified, a, forced, marriage, is, a, marriage, where, one, or, both, participants, are, married, without, their, freely, given, consent, in, many, parts, of, the, world, it, is, often, difficult, to, draw, a, line, between, forced, and, consensual, marriage, in, many, cultures, especially, in, south, asia, the, middle, east, and, parts, of, africa, marriages, are, prearranged, often, as, soon, as, a, girl, is, born, the, idea, of, a, girl, going, against, the, wishes, of, her, family, and, choosing, herself, her, own, future, husband, is, not, socially, accepted, there, is, no, need, to, use, threats, or, violence, to, force, the, marriage, the, future, bride, will, submit, because, she, simply, has, no, other, choice, as, in, the, case, of, child, marriage, the, customs, of, dowry, and, bride, price, contribute, to, this, phenomenon, a, child, marriage, is, a, marriage, where, one, or, both, parties, are, younger, than, 18, forced, and, child, marriages, are, associated, with, a, high, rate, of, domestic, violence, these, types, of, marriages, are, related, to, violence, both, in, regard, to, the, spousal, violence, perpetrated, inside, marriage, and, in, regard, to, the, violence, related, to, the, customs, and, traditions, of, these, marriage, violence, and, trafficking, related, to, the, payment, of, dowry, and, bride, price, honor, killings, for, refusing, the, marriage, the, un, population, fund, states, despite, near, universal, commitments, to, end, child, marriage, one, in, three, girls, in, developing, countries, excluding, china, will, probably, be, married, before, they, are, 18, one, out, of, nine, girls, will, be, married, before, their, 15th, birthday, the, un, population, fund, estimates, over, 67, million, women, 20, 24, year, old, in, 2010, had, been, married, as, girls, half, of, which, were, in, asia, and, one, fifth, in, africa, the, un, population, fund, says, that, in, the, next, decade, 14, 2, million, girls, under, 18, will, be, married, every, year, this, translates, into, 39, 000, girls, married, each, day, and, this, will, rise, to, an, average, of, 15, 1, million, girls, a, year, starting, in, 2021, until, 2030, if, present, trends, continue, lack, of, adequate, legislation, which, criminalizes, domestic, violence, or, alternatively, legislation, which, prohibits, consensual, behaviors, may, hinder, the, progress, in, regard, to, reducing, the, incidence, of, domestic, violence, amnesty, international, s, secretary, general, has, stated, that, it, is, unbelievable, that, in, the, twenty, first, century, some, countries, are, condoning, child, marriage, and, marital, rape, while, others, are, outlawing, abortion, sex, outside, marriage, and, same, sex, sexual, activity, even, punishable, by, death, according, to, who, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, violence, against, women, is, that, performed, by, a, husband, or, male, partner, the, who, notes, that, such, violence, is, often, ignored, because, often, legal, systems, and, cultural, norms, do, not, treat, as, a, crime, but, rather, as, a, private, family, matter, or, a, normal, part, of, life, the, criminalization, of, adultery, has, been, cited, as, inciting, violence, against, women, as, these, prohibitions, are, often, meant, in, law, or, in, practice, to, control, women, s, and, not, men, s, behavior, and, are, used, to, rationalize, acts, of, violence, against, women, many, countries, consider, domestic, violence, legal, or, have, not, adopted, measures, meant, to, criminalize, their, occurrence, especially, in, countries, of, muslim, majority, and, among, those, countries, some, consider, the, discipline, of, wives, as, a, right, of, the, husband, for, example, in, iraq, according, to, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, navi, pillay, some, have, argued, and, continue, to, argue, that, family, violence, is, placed, outside, the, conceptual, framework, of, international, human, rights, however, under, international, laws, and, standards, there, is, a, clear, state, responsibility, to, uphold, women, s, rights, and, ensure, freedom, from, discrimination, which, includes, the, responsibility, to, prevent, protect, and, provide, redress, regardless, of, sex, and, regardless, of, a, person, s, status, in, the, family, the, way, the, individual, rights, of, a, family, member, versus, the, rights, of, the, family, as, a, unit, are, balanced, vary, significantly, in, different, societies, this, may, influence, the, degree, to, which, a, government, may, be, willing, to, investigate, family, incidents, in, some, cultures, individual, members, of, the, family, are, expected, to, sacrifice, almost, completely, their, own, interests, in, favor, of, the, interests, of, the, family, as, a, whole, what, is, viewed, as, an, undue, expression, of, personal, autonomy, is, condemned, as, unacceptable, in, these, cultures, the, family, predominates, over, the, individual, and, where, this, interacts, with, cultures, of, honor, individualistic, choice, that, may, damage, the, family, reputation, in, the, community, may, result, in, extreme, punishment, such, as, honor, killings, in, australia, domestic, violence, refers, to, occurrences, of, violence, in, domestic, settings, between, people, in, intimate, relationships, the, term, can, be, altered, by, each, state, s, legislation, and, can, broaden, the, spectrum, of, domestic, violence, such, as, in, victoria, where, familial, relationships, and, witnessing, any, type, of, violence, in, the, family, is, defined, as, a, family, violence, incident, in, the, nordic, countries, the, term, violence, in, close, relations, is, used, in, legal, and, policy, contexts, domestic, violence, occurs, in, immigrant, communities, and, often, there, is, little, awareness, in, these, communities, of, the, laws, and, policies, of, the, host, country, a, study, among, first, generation, south, asians, in, the, uk, found, that, they, had, little, knowledge, about, what, constituted, criminal, behavior, under, the, english, law, the, researchers, found, that, there, was, certainly, no, awareness, that, there, could, be, rape, within, a, marriage, a, study, in, australia, showed, that, among, the, immigrant, women, sampled, who, were, abused, by, partners, and, did, not, report, it, 16, 7, did, not, know, domestic, violence, was, illegal, while, 18, 8, did, not, know, that, they, could, get, protection, the, ability, of, victims, of, domestic, violence, to, leave, the, relationship, is, crucial, for, preventing, further, abuse, in, traditional, communities, divorced, women, often, feel, rejected, and, ostracized, in, order, to, avoid, this, stigma, many, women, prefer, to, remain, in, the, marriage, and, endure, the, abuse, discriminatory, marriage, and, divorce, laws, can, also, play, a, role, in, the, proliferation, of, the, practice, according, to, rashida, manjoo, a, un, special, rapporteur, on, violence, against, women, in, many, countries, a, woman, s, access, to, property, hinges, on, her, relationship, to, a, man, when, she, separates, from, her, husband, or, when, he, dies, she, risks, losing, her, home, land, household, goods, and, other, property, failure, to, ensure, equal, property, rights, upon, separation, or, divorce, discourages, women, from, leaving, violent, marriages, as, women, may, be, forced, to, choose, between, violence, at, home, and, destitution, in, the, street, the, legal, inability, to, obtain, a, divorce, is, also, a, factor, in, the, proliferation, of, domestic, violence, in, some, cultures, where, marriages, are, arranged, between, families, a, woman, who, attempts, a, separation, or, divorce, without, the, consent, of, her, husband, and, extended, family, or, relatives, may, risk, being, subjected, to, honor, based, violence, the, custom, of, bride, price, also, makes, leaving, a, marriage, more, difficult, if, a, wife, wants, to, leave, the, husband, may, demand, back, the, bride, price, from, her, family, in, advanced, nations, like, the, uk, domestic, violence, victims, may, have, difficulties, getting, alternative, housing, which, can, force, them, to, stay, in, the, abusive, relationship, many, domestic, violence, victims, delay, leaving, the, abuser, because, they, have, pets, and, are, afraid, of, what, will, happen, to, the, pets, if, they, leave, safehouses, need, to, be, more, accepting, of, pets, and, many, refuse, to, accept, pets, in, some, countries, the, immigration, policy, is, tied, to, whether, the, person, desiring, citizenship, is, married, to, his, her, sponsor, this, can, lead, to, persons, being, trapped, in, violent, relations, such, persons, may, risk, deportation, if, they, attempt, to, separate, they, may, be, accused, of, having, entered, into, a, sham, marriage, often, the, women, come, from, cultures, where, they, will, suffer, disgrace, from, their, families, if, they, abandon, their, marriage, and, return, home, and, so, they, prefer, to, stay, married, therefore, remaining, locked, in, a, cycle, of, abuse, some, studies, have, found, some, association, between, the, covid, 19, pandemic, and, an, upsurge, in, the, rate, of, domestic, violence, the, coping, mechanisms, adopted, by, individuals, during, the, state, of, isolation, has, been, implicated, in, the, increase, around, the, globe, some, of, the, implications, of, this, restriction, period, are, financial, distress, induced, stress, frustration, and, a, resulting, quest, for, coping, mechanisms, which, could, trigger, violence, in, major, cities, in, nigeria, such, as, lagos, abuja, in, india, and, in, hubei, province, in, china, there, was, a, recorded, increase, in, the, level, of, intimate, partner, violence, an, increase, in, the, prevalence, of, domestic, violence, during, the, restrictions, has, been, reported, in, many, countries, including, the, us, china, and, many, european, countries, in, india, a, 131, increase, in, domestic, violence, in, areas, that, had, strict, lockdown, measures, was, recorded, bruises, broken, bones, head, injuries, lacerations, and, internal, bleeding, are, some, of, the, acute, effects, of, a, domestic, violence, incident, that, require, medical, attention, and, hospitalization, some, chronic, health, conditions, that, have, been, linked, to, victims, of, domestic, violence, are, arthritis, irritable, bowel, syndrome, chronic, pain, pelvic, pain, ulcers, and, migraines, victims, who, are, pregnant, during, a, domestic, violence, relationship, experience, greater, risk, of, miscarriage, pre, term, labor, and, injury, to, or, death, of, the, fetus, new, research, illustrates, that, there, are, strong, associations, between, exposure, to, domestic, violence, and, abuse, in, all, their, forms, and, higher, rates, of, many, chronic, conditions, the, strongest, evidence, comes, from, the, adverse, childhood, experiences, study, which, shows, correlations, between, exposure, to, abuse, or, neglect, and, higher, rates, in, adulthood, of, chronic, conditions, high, risk, health, behaviors, and, shortened, life, span, evidence, of, the, association, between, physical, health, and, violence, against, women, has, been, accumulating, since, the, early, 1990s, the, who, has, stated, that, women, in, abusive, relations, are, at, significantly, higher, risk, of, hiv, aids, who, states, that, women, in, violent, relationships, have, difficulty, negotiating, safer, sex, with, their, partners, are, often, forced, to, have, sex, and, find, it, difficult, to, ask, for, appropriate, testing, when, they, think, they, may, be, infected, with, hiv, a, decade, of, cross, sectional, research, from, rwanda, tanzania, south, africa, and, india, has, consistently, found, women, who, have, experienced, partner, violence, to, be, more, likely, to, be, infected, with, hiv, the, who, stated, that, there, is, a, compelling, case, to, end, intimate, partner, violence, both, in, its, own, right, as, well, as, to, reduce, women, and, girls, vulnerability, to, hiv, aids, the, evidence, on, the, linkages, between, violence, against, women, and, hiv, aids, highlights, that, there, are, direct, and, indirect, mechanisms, by, which, the, two, interact, same, sex, relationships, are, similarly, affected, by, the, hiv, aids, status, in, domestic, violence, research, by, heintz, and, melendez, found, that, same, sex, individuals, may, have, difficulty, breaching, the, topic, of, safe, sex, for, reasons, such, as, decreased, perception, of, control, over, sex, fear, of, violence, and, unequal, power, distributions, of, those, who, reported, violence, in, the, study, about, 50, reported, forced, sexual, experiences, of, which, only, half, reported, the, use, of, safe, sex, measures, barriers, to, safer, sex, included, fear, of, abuse, and, deception, in, safe, sex, practices, heintz, and, melendez, s, research, ultimately, concluded, that, sexual, assault, abuse, in, same, sex, relationships, provides, a, major, concern, for, hiv, aids, infection, as, it, decreases, instances, of, safe, sex, furthermore, these, incidents, create, additional, fear, and, stigma, surrounding, safe, sex, conversations, and, knowing, one, s, std, status, among, victims, who, are, still, living, with, their, perpetrators, high, amounts, of, stress, fear, and, anxiety, are, commonly, reported, depression, is, also, common, as, victims, are, made, to, feel, guilty, for, provoking, the, abuse, and, are, frequently, subjected, to, intense, criticism, it, is, reported, that, 60, of, victims, meet, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, depression, either, during, or, after, termination, of, the, relationship, and, have, a, greatly, increased, risk, of, suicide, those, who, are, battered, either, emotionally, or, physically, often, are, also, depressed, because, of, a, feeling, of, worthlessness, these, feelings, often, persist, long, term, and, it, is, suggested, that, many, receive, therapy, for, it, because, of, the, heightened, risk, of, suicide, and, other, traumatic, symptoms, in, addition, to, depression, victims, of, domestic, violence, also, commonly, experience, long, term, anxiety, and, panic, and, are, likely, to, meet, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, generalized, anxiety, disorder, and, panic, disorder, the, most, commonly, referenced, psychological, effect, of, domestic, violence, is, ptsd, which, is, characterized, by, flashbacks, intrusive, images, an, exaggerated, startle, response, nightmares, and, avoidance, of, triggers, that, are, associated, with, the, abuse, studies, have, indicated, that, it, is, important, to, consider, the, effect, of, domestic, violence, and, its, psychophysiologic, sequelae, on, women, who, are, mothers, of, infants, and, young, children, several, studies, have, shown, that, maternal, interpersonal, violence, related, ptsd, can, despite, a, traumatized, mother, s, best, efforts, interfere, with, their, child, s, response, to, the, domestic, violence, and, other, traumatic, events, a, 2024, study, in, the, quarterly, journal, of, economics, which, used, finnish, administrative, data, with, unique, identifiers, for, perpetrators, and, victims, of, domestic, violence, found, that, women, who, begin, relationships, with, eventually, physically, abusive, men, suffer, large, and, significant, earnings, and, employment, falls, immediately, upon, cohabiting, with, the, abusive, partner, this, contributes, to, economic, dependence, on, the, abuser, that, makes, it, hard, for, the, victim, to, exit, the, relationship, once, victims, leave, their, perpetrators, they, can, be, stunned, by, the, reality, of, the, extent, to, which, the, abuse, has, taken, away, their, autonomy, due, to, economic, abuse, and, isolation, the, victim, usually, has, very, little, money, of, their, own, and, few, people, on, whom, they, can, rely, when, seeking, help, this, has, been, shown, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, obstacles, facing, victims, of, domestic, violence, and, the, strongest, factor, that, can, discourage, them, from, leaving, their, perpetrators, in, addition, to, lacking, financial, resources, victims, of, domestic, violence, often, lack, specialized, skills, education, and, training, that, are, necessary, to, find, gainful, employment, and, also, may, have, several, children, to, support, in, 2003, thirty, six, major, us, cities, cited, domestic, violence, as, one, of, the, primary, causes, of, homelessness, in, their, areas, it, has, also, been, reported, that, one, out, of, every, three, women, are, homeless, due, to, having, left, a, domestic, violence, relationship, if, a, victim, is, able, to, secure, rental, housing, it, is, likely, that, her, apartment, complex, will, have, zero, tolerance, policies, for, crime, these, policies, can, cause, them, to, face, eviction, even, if, they, are, the, victim, not, the, perpetrator, of, violence, while, the, number, of, women, s, shelters, and, community, resources, available, to, domestic, violence, victims, has, grown, tremendously, these, agencies, often, have, few, employees, and, hundreds, of, victims, seeking, assistance, which, causes, many, victims, to, remain, without, the, assistance, they, need, women, and, children, experiencing, domestic, violence, undergo, occupational, apartheid, they, are, typically, denied, access, to, desired, occupations, abusive, partners, may, limit, occupations, and, create, an, occupationally, void, environment, which, reinforces, feelings, of, low, self, worth, and, poor, self, efficacy, in, their, ability, to, satisfactorily, perform, everyday, tasks, in, addition, work, is, impacted, by, functional, losses, an, inability, to, maintain, necessary, employment, skills, and, an, inability, to, function, within, the, work, place, often, the, victims, are, very, isolated, from, other, relationships, as, well, such, as, having, few, to, no, friends, this, is, another, method, of, control, for, the, abuser, there, has, been, an, increase, in, acknowledgment, that, a, child, who, is, exposed, to, domestic, abuse, during, their, upbringing, will, suffer, developmental, and, psychological, damage, during, the, mid, 1990s, the, adverse, childhood, experiences, study, found, that, children, who, were, exposed, to, domestic, violence, and, other, forms, of, abuse, had, a, higher, risk, of, developing, mental, and, physical, health, problems, because, of, the, awareness, of, domestic, violence, that, some, children, have, to, face, it, also, generally, impacts, how, the, child, develops, emotionally, socially, behaviorally, and, cognitively, some, emotional, and, behavioral, problems, that, can, result, due, to, domestic, violence, include, increased, aggressiveness, anxiety, and, changes, in, how, a, child, socializes, with, friends, family, and, authorities, depression, emotional, insecurity, and, mental, health, disorders, can, follow, due, to, traumatic, experiences, problems, with, attitude, and, cognition, in, schools, can, start, developing, along, with, a, lack, of, skills, such, as, problem, solving, correlation, has, been, found, between, the, experience, of, abuse, and, neglect, in, childhood, and, perpetrating, domestic, violence, and, sexual, abuse, in, adulthood, additionally, in, some, cases, the, abuser, will, purposely, abuse, the, mother, or, father, in, front, of, the, child, to, cause, a, ripple, effect, hurting, two, victims, simultaneously, children, may, intervene, when, they, witness, severe, violence, against, a, parent, which, can, place, a, child, at, greater, risk, for, injury, or, death, it, has, been, found, that, children, who, witness, mother, assault, are, more, likely, to, exhibit, symptoms, of, ptsd, consequences, to, these, children, are, likely, to, be, more, severe, if, their, assaulted, mother, develops, ptsd, and, does, not, seek, treatment, due, to, her, difficulty, in, assisting, her, child, with, processing, his, or, her, own, experience, of, witnessing, the, domestic, violence, an, analysis, in, the, us, showed, that, 106, of, the, 771, officer, killings, between, 1996, and, 2009, occurred, during, domestic, violence, interventions, of, these, 51, were, defined, as, unprovoked, or, as, ambushes, taking, place, before, officers, had, made, contact, with, suspects, another, 40, occurred, after, contact, and, the, remainder, took, place, during, tactical, situations, those, involving, hostages, and, attempts, to, overcome, barricades, the, fbi, s, leoka, system, grouped, officer, domestic, violence, response, deaths, into, the, category, of, disturbances, along, with, bar, fights, gang, matters, and, persons, brandishing, weapons, which, may, have, given, rise, to, a, misperception, of, the, risks, involved, due, to, the, gravity, and, intensity, of, hearing, victims, stories, of, abuse, professionals, social, workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical, professionals, are, at, risk, themselves, for, secondary, or, vicarious, trauma, which, causes, the, responder, to, experience, trauma, symptoms, similar, to, the, original, victim, after, hearing, about, the, victim, s, experiences, with, abuse, research, has, demonstrated, that, professionals, who, experience, vicarious, trauma, show, signs, of, an, exaggerated, startle, response, hypervigilance, nightmares, and, intrusive, thoughts, although, they, have, not, experienced, a, trauma, personally, and, do, not, qualify, for, a, clinical, diagnosis, of, ptsd, domestic, violence, occurs, across, the, world, in, various, cultures, and, affects, people, of, all, economic, statuses, however, indicators, of, lower, socioeconomic, status, such, as, unemployment, and, low, income, have, been, shown, to, be, risk, factors, for, higher, levels, of, domestic, violence, in, several, studies, worldwide, domestic, violence, against, women, is, most, common, in, central, sub, saharan, africa, western, sub, saharan, africa, andean, latin, america, south, asia, eastern, sub, saharan, africa, northern, africa, and, the, middle, east, the, lowest, prevalence, of, domestic, violence, against, women, is, found, in, western, europe, east, asia, and, north, america, in, diverse, countries, there, are, often, ethnic, and, racial, differences, in, victimization, and, use, of, services, in, the, united, states, white, women, and, black, women, were, more, likely, to, be, victims, of, domestic, violence, assault, than, were, asian, or, hispanic, women, according, to, a, 2012, study, non, hispanic, white, women, are, two, times, more, likely, to, use, domestic, violence, services, as, compared, with, hispanic, women, in, the, united, kingdom, there, is, also, much, research, to, suggest, that, income, is, closely, associated, with, domestic, violence, as, domestic, violence, is, consistently, more, common, in, families, with, low, income, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, reports, that, in, the, united, states, 41, of, women, and, 26, of, men, experience, domestic, violence, within, their, lifetime, in, the, united, kingdom, statistics, show, that, 1, in, 3, victims, of, domestic, abuse, are, male, this, figure, comes, from, the, office, of, national, statistics, and, that, 1, in, 7, men, and, 1, in, 4, women, will, be, a, victim, at, some, point, in, their, lifetime, the, annual, reporded, serious, assaults, per, capita, against, intimate, partners, or, family, members, is, shown, below, by, country, for, last, available, year, definition, of, sexual, assault, differs, between, countries, domestic, violence, is, among, the, most, underreported, crimes, worldwide, for, both, men, and, women, a, 2011, review, article, by, intimate, partner, violence, researcher, ko, ling, chan, found, men, tended, to, underreport, their, own, perpetration, of, domestic, violence, while, women, were, more, likely, to, underreport, their, victimization, and, overestimate, their, own, violence, perpetration, financial, or, familial, dependence, normalization, of, violence, and, self, blaming, were, found, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, self, reporting, victimization, in, women, by, contrast, fear, and, avoidance, of, legal, consequences, the, tendency, to, blame, their, partner, and, a, narrative, focus, on, their, own, needs, and, emotions, reduced, the, likelihood, of, self, reporting, perpetration, in, men, a, 2014, study, conducted, across, the, 28, member, states, of, the, eu, found, that, only, 14, of, women, reported, their, most, serious, incident, of, intimate, partner, violence, to, the, police, a, 2009, report, on, domestic, violence, in, northern, ireland, found, that, under, reporting, is, a, concern, and, domestic, abuse, is, the, least, likely, of, all, violent, crimes, to, be, reported, to, the, police, male, victims, are, less, likely, to, report, domestic, violence, than, female, victims, and, may, face, additional, gender, related, barriers, in, reporting, due, to, social, stigmas, regarding, male, victimization, and, an, increased, likelihood, of, being, overlooked, by, healthcare, providers, during, lockdown, for, covid, 19, some, victims, were, inside, their, homes, with, their, abusers, they, were, left, without, an, escape, during, this, period, which, further, led, to, underreporting, activists, in, china, have, stated, that, 90, of, domestic, violence, cases, have, resulted, because, of, the, lockdown, the, situation, is, the, same, in, several, european, countries, struggling, with, the, virus, there, continues, to, be, some, debate, regarding, gender, differences, with, relation, to, domestic, violence, limitations, of, methodology, such, as, the, conflict, tactics, scale, that, fail, to, capture, injury, homicide, and, sexual, violence, rates, context, e, g, motivations, fear, disparate, sampling, procedures, respondent, reluctance, to, self, report, and, differences, in, operationalization, all, pose, challenges, to, existing, research, normalization, of, domestic, violence, in, those, who, experience, covert, forms, of, abuse, or, have, been, abused, by, multiple, partners, for, long, periods, of, time, reduces, the, likelihood, of, recognizing, and, therefore, reporting, domestic, violence, many, organizations, have, made, efforts, to, use, gender, neutral, terms, when, referring, to, perpetration, and, victimization, for, example, using, broader, terms, like, family, violence, rather, than, violence, against, women, findings, often, indicate, that, when, committing, domestic, violence, women, are, more, likely, than, men, to, be, motivated, by, self, defense, and, or, retaliation, or, fear, a, 2010, systematic, review, of, the, literature, on, women, s, perpetration, of, ipv, found, that, the, common, motives, for, female, on, male, ipv, were, anger, a, need, for, attention, or, as, a, response, to, their, partner, s, violence, it, also, stated, that, while, self, defense, and, retaliation, were, common, motivations, distinguishing, between, self, defense, and, retaliation, was, difficult, another, review, found, than, men, and, women, commit, equal, levels, of, physical, or, psychological, aggression, and, men, are, more, likely, to, commit, sexual, abuse, coercive, control, and, stalking, another, family, violence, research, by, murray, a, straus, concluded, that, most, ipv, perpetrated, by, women, against, men, is, not, motivated, by, self, defense, other, research, supports, straus, s, conclusion, about, female, perpetrated, ipv, but, adds, that, men, are, more, likely, to, retaliate, for, being, hit, straus, s, research, was, criticized, by, loseke, et, al, for, using, narrow, definitions, of, self, defense, sherry, hamby, states, that, sexual, violence, is, often, left, out, of, measures, of, ipv, when, sexual, violence, is, accounted, for, female, perpetrators, make, up, less, than, 10, she, says, that, males, self, reports, of, victimization, are, unreliable, as, they, consistently, underreport, their, own, violence, perpetration, and, also, that, both, men, and, women, use, ipv, for, coercive, control, coercive, control, is, when, one, person, uses, a, variety, of, ipv, tactics, to, control, and, dominate, the, other, with, little, empathy, victims, often, resist, with, physical, violence, it, is, generally, perpetrated, by, men, against, women, and, is, the, most, likely, of, the, types, to, cause, trauma, bonding, and, require, medical, services, a, 2011, review, by, researcher, chan, ko, ling, from, the, university, of, hong, kong, found, that, perpetration, of, minor, partner, violence, was, equal, for, both, men, and, women, but, more, severe, partner, violence, was, far, likelier, to, be, perpetrated, by, men, his, analysis, found, that, men, were, more, likely, to, beat, up, choke, or, strangle, their, partners, while, women, were, more, likely, to, throw, objects, slap, kick, bite, punch, or, hit, with, an, object, researchers, have, also, found, significantly, different, outcomes, for, men, and, women, in, response, to, intimate, partner, violence, a, 2012, review, from, the, journal, psychology, of, violence, found, that, women, suffered, disproportionately, as, a, result, of, intimate, partner, violence, especially, in, terms, of, injuries, fear, and, ptsd, the, review, also, found, that, 70, of, female, victims, in, one, study, were, very, frightened, in, response, to, ipv, from, their, partners, but, 85, of, male, victims, reported, no, fear, and, that, ipv, mediated, the, satisfaction, of, the, relationship, for, women, but, not, for, men, hamberger, s, review, in, 2005, found, that, men, tend, to, respond, to, female, partner, initiated, ipv, with, laughter, and, amusement, researchers, report, that, male, violence, causes, great, fear, fear, is, the, force, that, provides, battering, with, its, power, and, injuries, help, sustain, the, fear, a, 2013, review, examined, studies, from, five, continents, and, the, correlation, between, a, country, s, level, of, gender, inequality, and, rates, of, domestic, violence, the, authors, found, that, when, partner, abuse, is, defined, broadly, to, include, emotional, abuse, any, kind, of, hitting, and, who, hits, first, partner, abuse, is, relatively, even, they, also, stated, if, one, examines, who, is, physically, harmed, and, how, seriously, expresses, more, fear, and, experiences, subsequent, psychological, problems, domestic, violence, is, significantly, gendered, toward, women, as, victims, laws, on, domestic, violence, vary, by, country, while, it, is, generally, outlawed, in, the, western, world, this, is, not, the, case, in, many, developing, countries, for, instance, in, 2010, the, united, arab, emirates, s, supreme, court, ruled, that, a, man, has, the, right, to, physically, discipline, his, wife, and, children, as, long, as, he, does, not, leave, physical, marks, the, social, acceptability, of, domestic, violence, also, differs, by, country, while, in, most, developed, countries, domestic, violence, is, considered, unacceptable, by, most, people, in, many, regions, of, the, world, the, views, are, different, according, to, a, unicef, survey, the, percentage, of, women, aged, 15, 49, who, think, that, a, husband, is, justified, in, hitting, or, beating, his, wife, under, certain, circumstances, is, for, example, 90, in, afghanistan, and, jordan, 87, in, mali, 86, in, guinea, and, timor, leste, 81, in, laos, 80, in, central, african, republic, refusing, to, submit, to, a, husband, s, wishes, is, a, common, reason, given, for, justification, of, violence, in, developing, countries, for, instance, 62, 4, of, women, in, tajikistan, justify, wife, beating, if, the, wife, goes, out, without, telling, the, husband, 68, if, she, argues, with, him, 47, 9, if, she, refuses, to, have, sex, with, him, the, un, population, fund, found, violence, against, women, and, girls, to, be, one, of, the, most, prevalent, human, rights, violations, worldwide, stating, that, one, in, three, women, will, experience, physical, or, sexual, abuse, in, her, lifetime, violence, against, women, tends, to, be, less, prevalent, in, developed, western, nations, and, more, normalized, in, the, developing, world, wife, beating, was, made, illegal, nationally, in, the, us, by, 1920, although, the, exact, rates, are, disputed, there, is, a, large, body, of, cross, cultural, evidence, that, women, are, subjected, to, domestic, violence, significantly, more, often, than, men, in, addition, there, is, broad, consensus, that, women, are, more, often, subjected, to, severe, forms, of, abuse, and, are, more, likely, to, be, injured, by, an, abusive, partner, and, this, is, exacerbated, by, economic, or, social, dependence, the, 1993, un, declaration, on, the, elimination, of, violence, against, women, devaw, states, that, violence, against, women, is, a, manifestation, of, historically, unequal, power, relations, between, men, and, women, which, has, led, to, domination, over, and, discrimination, against, women, by, men, and, to, the, prevention, of, the, full, advancement, of, women, and, that, violence, against, women, is, one, of, the, crucial, social, mechanisms, by, which, women, are, forced, into, a, subordinate, position, compared, with, men, the, devaw, classifies, violence, against, women, into, three, categories, that, occurring, in, the, family, domestic, violence, that, occurring, within, the, general, community, and, that, perpetrated, or, condoned, by, the, state, the, inter, american, convention, on, the, prevention, punishment, and, eradication, of, violence, against, women, defines, violence, against, women, as, any, act, or, conduct, based, on, gender, which, causes, death, or, physical, sexual, or, psychological, harm, or, suffering, to, women, whether, in, the, public, or, the, private, sphere, similarly, with, the, devaw, it, classifies, violence, against, women, into, three, categories, one, of, which, being, domestic, violence, defined, as, violence, against, women, which, takes, place, within, the, family, domestic, unit, or, within, any, other, interpersonal, relationship, whether, or, not, the, perpetrator, shares, or, has, shared, the, same, residence, with, the, woman, the, maputo, protocol, of, the, african, charter, on, human, and, peoples, rights, adopted, a, broader, definition, defining, violence, against, women, as, all, acts, perpetrated, against, women, which, cause, or, could, cause, them, physical, sexual, psychological, and, economic, harm, including, the, threat, to, take, such, acts, or, to, undertake, the, imposition, of, arbitrary, restrictions, on, or, deprivation, of, fundamental, freedoms, in, private, or, public, life, in, peacetime, and, during, situations, of, armed, conflicts, or, of, war, the, istanbul, convention, states, violence, against, women, is, understood, as, a, violation, of, human, rights, and, a, form, of, discrimination, against, women, article, 3, definitions, in, the, landmark, case, of, opuz, v, turkey, the, european, court, of, human, rights, held, for, the, first, time, that, gender, based, domestic, violence, is, a, form, of, discrimination, under, the, european, convention, according, to, one, study, the, percentage, of, women, who, have, reported, being, physically, abused, by, an, intimate, partner, vary, from, 69, to, 10, depending, on, the, country, in, the, us, it, is, estimated, that, intimate, partner, violence, accounts, for, 15, of, all, violent, crime, research, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, in, 2017, found, that, over, half, of, all, female, homicides, are, committed, by, intimate, partners, 98, of, whom, are, men, femicide, is, usually, defined, as, the, sex, based, killing, of, women, or, girls, by, men, although, the, exact, definitions, vary, feminist, author, diana, e, h, russell, first, defined, the, term, in, 1976, as, the, killing, of, females, by, males, because, they, are, female, femicides, often, occur, in, the, context, of, domestic, violence, such, as, honor, killings, or, dowry, killings, for, statistical, purposes, femicide, is, often, defined, as, any, killing, of, a, woman, the, top, countries, by, rate, of, femicide, are, el, salvador, jamaica, guatemala, south, africa, and, mexico, data, from, 2004, to, 2009, however, in, el, salvador, and, colombia, which, have, a, very, high, rate, of, femicide, only, 3, of, all, femicides, are, committed, by, a, current, or, former, intimate, partner, while, in, cyprus, france, and, portugal, former, and, current, partners, are, responsible, for, more, than, 80, of, all, cases, of, femicide, research, on, men, and, domestic, violence, focuses, on, men, as, both, perpetrators, and, victims, of, violence, as, well, as, on, how, to, involve, men, and, boys, in, anti, violence, work, domestic, violence, against, men, includes, physical, emotional, and, sexual, forms, of, abuse, including, mutual, violence, male, victims, may, be, reluctant, to, get, help, for, various, reasons, one, study, investigated, whether, women, who, assaulted, their, male, partners, were, more, likely, to, avoid, arrest, even, when, the, male, contacts, police, and, found, that, police, are, particularly, unlikely, to, arrest, women, who, assault, their, male, partners, the, reason, being, that, they, assume, that, the, man, can, protect, himself, from, his, female, partner, and, that, a, woman, s, violence, is, not, dangerous, unless, she, assaults, someone, other, than, her, partner, another, study, concluded, there, is, some, support, for, qualitative, research, suggesting, that, court, personnel, are, responsive, to, the, gendered, asymmetry, of, intimate, partner, violence, and, may, view, female, intimate, violence, perpetrators, more, as, victims, than, offenders, abuse, of, parents, by, their, children, also, known, as, child, to, parent, violence, cpv, is, one, of, the, most, under, reported, and, under, researched, subject, areas, in, the, field, of, psychology, parents, are, quite, often, subject, to, levels, of, childhood, aggression, in, excess, of, normal, childhood, aggressive, outbursts, typically, in, the, form, of, verbal, or, physical, abuse, parents, feel, a, sense, of, shame, and, humiliation, to, have, that, problem, so, they, rarely, seek, help, parental, abuse, has, been, defined, by, cottrell, as, any, harmful, act, of, a, teenage, child, intended, to, gain, power, and, control, over, a, parent, the, abuse, can, be, physical, psychological, or, financial, and, often, takes, places, during, the, teen, years, often, from, 12, to, 17, but, it, can, happen, earlier, than, that, the, effects, of, experiencing, abuse, from, one, s, child, can, be, profound, in, the, short, term, ongoing, parent, abuse, has, been, found, to, impact, on, a, parent, s, and, other, family, members, physical, and, psychological, health, with, specific, negative, emotions, such, as, fear, shame, guilt, and, despair, commonly, reported, a, child, may, become, abusive, if, they, have, suffered, some, form, of, abuse, themselves, although, this, may, not, always, be, the, case, parent, abuse, may, derive, not, only, from, individualized, issues, but, also, from, structural, societal, and, cultural, factors, among, adolescents, researchers, have, primarily, focused, on, heterosexual, caucasian, populations, the, literature, indicates, that, rates, are, similar, for, the, number, of, girls, and, boys, in, heterosexual, relationships, who, report, experiencing, intimate, partner, violence, ipv, or, that, girls, in, heterosexual, relationships, are, more, likely, than, their, male, counterparts, to, report, perpetrating, ipv, ely, et, al, stated, that, unlike, domestic, violence, in, general, equal, rates, of, ipv, perpetration, is, a, unique, characteristic, with, regard, to, adolescent, dating, violence, and, that, this, is, perhaps, because, the, period, of, adolescence, a, special, developmental, state, is, accompanied, by, sexual, characteristics, that, are, distinctly, different, from, the, characteristics, of, adult, wekerle, and, wolfe, theorized, that, a, mutually, coercive, and, violent, dynamic, may, form, during, adolescence, a, time, when, males, and, females, are, more, equal, on, a, physical, level, and, that, this, physical, equality, allows, girls, to, assert, more, power, through, physical, violence, than, is, possible, for, an, adult, female, attacked, by, a, fully, physically, mature, man, sherry, hamby, stated, that, horseplay, and, joking, among, adolescents, and, young, adults, is, common, and, that, a, small, but, growing, body, of, research, indicates, that, females, may, be, more, likely, to, include, this, sort, of, joking, around, in, responses, to, ipv, questionnaires, than, males, leading, to, an, apparent, gender, parity, in, some, studies, while, the, general, literature, indicates, that, adolescent, boys, and, girls, engage, in, ipv, at, about, equal, rates, females, are, more, likely, to, use, less, dangerous, forms, of, physical, violence, e, g, pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching, or, kicking, while, males, are, more, likely, to, punch, strangle, beat, burn, or, threaten, with, weapons, males, are, also, more, likely, to, use, sexual, aggression, although, both, genders, are, equally, likely, to, pressure, their, partner, into, sexual, activities, in, addition, females, are, four, times, more, likely, to, respond, as, having, experienced, rape, and, are, more, likely, to, suffer, fatal, injuries, inflicted, by, their, partner, or, to, need, psychological, help, as, a, result, of, the, abuse, females, are, more, likely, to, consider, ipv, a, serious, problem, than, are, their, male, counterparts, who, are, more, likely, to, disregard, female, perpetrated, ipv, along, with, form, motivations, for, violence, also, vary, by, gender, females, are, likely, to, perpetrate, violence, in, self, defense, while, males, are, likely, to, perpetrate, violence, to, exert, power, or, control, the, self, defense, aspect, is, supported, by, findings, that, previous, victimization, is, a, stronger, predictor, of, perpetration, in, females, than, in, males, other, research, indicates, that, boys, who, have, been, abused, in, childhood, by, a, family, member, are, more, prone, to, ipv, perpetration, while, girls, who, have, been, abused, in, childhood, by, a, family, member, are, prone, to, lack, empathy, and, self, efficacy, but, the, risks, for, the, likelihood, of, ipv, perpetration, and, victimization, among, adolescents, vary, and, are, not, well, understood, hamby, s, 2018, literature, review, of, 33, studies, using, a, scale, that, rules, out, the, false, positives, of, horseplay, and, joking, indicates, that, males, report, perpetrating, significantly, more, violence, than, females, there, is, a, strong, link, between, domestic, violence, and, child, abuse, since, domestic, violence, is, a, pattern, of, behavior, these, incidences, may, increase, in, severity, and, frequency, resulting, in, an, increased, probability, the, children, themselves, will, become, victims, the, estimated, overlap, between, domestic, violence, and, child, abuse, ranges, from, 30, to, 50, percent, today, corporal, punishment, of, children, by, their, parents, remains, legal, in, a, majority, of, countries, but, in, western, countries, that, still, allow, the, practice, there, are, strict, limits, on, what, is, permitted, the, first, country, to, outlaw, parental, corporal, punishment, was, sweden, parents, right, to, spank, their, own, children, was, first, removed, in, 1966, and, it, was, explicitly, prohibited, by, law, from, july, 1979, as, of, 2021, corporal, punishment, of, children, is, banned, in, all, settings, including, by, parents, in, 63, countries, historically, domestic, violence, has, been, seen, as, a, heterosexual, family, issue, and, little, interest, has, been, directed, at, violence, in, same, sex, relationships, but, domestic, violence, does, occur, in, same, sex, relationships, as, well, the, encyclopedia, of, victimology, and, crime, prevention, states, for, several, methodological, reasons, nonrandom, sampling, procedures, and, self, selection, factors, among, others, it, is, not, possible, to, assess, the, extent, of, same, sex, domestic, violence, studies, on, abuse, between, gay, male, or, lesbian, partners, usually, rely, on, small, convenience, samples, such, as, lesbian, or, gay, male, members, of, an, association, a, 1999, analysis, of, nineteen, studies, of, partner, abuse, concluded, that, research, suggests, that, lesbians, and, gay, men, are, just, as, likely, to, abuse, their, partners, as, heterosexual, men, in, 2011, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, released, the, 2010, results, of, their, national, intimate, partner, and, sexual, violence, survey, and, report, that, 44, of, lesbian, women, 61, of, bisexual, women, and, 35, of, heterosexual, women, have, experienced, domestic, violence, in, their, lifetime, this, same, report, states, that, 26, of, gay, men, 37, of, bisexual, men, and, 29, of, heterosexual, men, have, experienced, domestic, violence, in, their, lifetime, a, 2013, study, showed, that, 40, 4, of, self, identified, lesbians, and, 56, 9, of, bisexual, women, have, reported, being, victims, of, partner, violence, in, 2014, national, surveys, indicated, that, anywhere, from, 25, to, 50, of, gay, and, bisexual, males, have, experienced, physical, violence, from, a, partner, some, sources, indicate, that, gay, and, lesbian, couples, experience, domestic, violence, at, the, same, frequency, as, heterosexual, couples, while, other, state, that, domestic, violence, among, gay, lesbian, and, bisexual, individuals, might, be, higher, than, among, heterosexual, individuals, that, gay, lesbian, and, bisexual, individuals, are, less, likely, to, report, domestic, violence, that, has, occurred, in, their, intimate, relationships, than, heterosexual, couples, are, or, that, lesbian, couples, experience, domestic, violence, less, than, heterosexual, couples, do, one, study, focusing, on, hispanic, men, indicated, that, gay, men, are, less, likely, to, have, been, perpetrators, or, victims, of, domestic, violence, than, heterosexual, men, but, that, bisexual, men, are, more, likely, to, have, been, both, by, contrast, some, researchers, commonly, assume, that, lesbian, couples,
