gross, domestic, product, gdp, is, a, monetary, measure, of, the, market, value, of, all, the, final, goods, and, services, produced, and, rendered, in, a, specific, time, period, by, a, country, or, countries, gdp, is, often, used, to, measure, the, economic, health, of, a, country, or, region, definitions, of, gdp, are, maintained, by, several, national, and, international, economic, organizations, such, as, the, oecd, and, the, international, monetary, fund, the, ratio, of, gdp, to, the, total, population, of, the, region, is, the, gdp, per, capita, and, can, approximate, a, concept, of, a, standard, of, living, nominal, gdp, does, not, reflect, differences, in, the, cost, of, living, and, the, inflation, rates, of, the, countries, therefore, using, a, basis, of, gdp, per, capita, at, purchasing, power, parity, ppp, may, be, more, useful, when, comparing, living, standards, between, nations, while, nominal, gdp, is, more, useful, comparing, national, economies, on, the, international, market, total, gdp, can, also, be, broken, down, into, the, contribution, of, each, industry, or, sector, of, the, economy, gdp, is, often, used, as, a, metric, for, international, comparisons, as, well, as, a, broad, measure, of, economic, progress, it, is, often, considered, to, be, the, world, s, most, powerful, statistical, indicator, of, national, development, and, progress, however, critics, of, the, growth, imperative, often, argue, that, gdp, measures, were, never, intended, to, measure, progress, and, leave, out, key, other, externalities, such, as, resource, extraction, environmental, impact, and, unpaid, domestic, work, alternative, economic, indicators, such, as, doughnut, economics, use, other, measures, such, as, the, human, development, index, or, better, life, index, as, better, approaches, to, measuring, the, effect, of, the, economy, on, human, development, and, well, being, william, petty, came, up, with, a, concept, of, gdp, to, calculate, the, tax, burden, and, argue, landlords, were, unfairly, taxed, during, warfare, between, the, dutch, and, the, english, between, 1652, 74, charles, davenant, developed, the, method, further, in, 1695, the, modern, concept, of, gdp, was, first, developed, by, simon, kuznets, for, a, 1934, u, s, congress, report, where, he, warned, against, its, use, as, a, measure, of, welfare, see, below, under, limitations, and, criticisms, after, the, bretton, woods, conference, in, 1944, gdp, became, the, main, tool, for, measuring, a, country, s, economy, at, that, time, gross, national, product, gnp, was, the, preferred, estimate, which, differed, from, gdp, in, that, it, measured, production, by, a, country, s, citizens, at, home, and, abroad, rather, than, its, resident, institutional, units, see, oecd, definition, above, the, switch, from, gnp, to, gdp, in, the, united, states, occurred, in, 1991, the, role, that, measurements, of, gdp, played, in, world, war, ii, was, crucial, to, the, subsequent, political, acceptance, of, gdp, values, as, indicators, of, national, development, and, progress, a, crucial, role, was, played, here, by, the, u, s, department, of, commerce, under, milton, gilbert, where, ideas, from, kuznets, were, embedded, into, institutions, the, history, of, the, concept, of, gdp, should, be, distinguished, from, the, history, of, changes, in, many, ways, of, estimating, it, the, value, added, by, firms, is, relatively, easy, to, calculate, from, their, accounts, but, the, value, added, by, the, public, sector, by, financial, industries, and, by, intangible, asset, creation, is, more, complex, these, activities, are, increasingly, important, in, developed, economies, and, the, international, conventions, governing, their, estimation, and, their, inclusion, or, exclusion, in, gdp, regularly, change, in, an, attempt, to, keep, up, with, industrial, advances, in, the, words, of, one, academic, economist, the, actual, number, for, gdp, is, therefore, the, product, of, a, vast, patchwork, of, statistics, and, a, complicated, set, of, processes, carried, out, on, the, raw, data, to, fit, them, to, the, conceptual, framework, china, officially, adopted, gdp, in, 1993, as, its, indicator, of, economic, performance, previously, china, had, relied, on, a, marxist, inspired, national, accounting, system, gdp, can, be, determined, in, three, ways, all, of, which, should, theoretically, give, the, same, result, they, are, the, production, or, output, or, value, added, approach, the, income, approach, and, the, speculated, expenditure, approach, it, is, representative, of, the, total, output, and, income, within, an, economy, the, most, direct, of, the, three, is, the, production, approach, which, sums, up, the, outputs, of, every, class, of, enterprise, to, arrive, at, the, total, the, expenditure, approach, works, on, the, principle, that, all, of, the, products, must, be, bought, by, somebody, therefore, the, value, of, the, total, product, must, be, equal, to, people, s, total, expenditures, in, buying, things, the, income, approach, works, on, the, principle, that, the, incomes, of, the, productive, factors, producers, colloquially, must, be, equal, to, the, value, of, their, product, and, determines, gdp, by, finding, the, sum, of, all, producers, incomes, also, known, as, the, value, added, approach, it, calculates, how, much, value, is, contributed, at, each, stage, of, production, this, approach, mirrors, the, oecd, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, definition, given, above, gross, value, added, gross, value, of, output, value, of, intermediate, consumption, value, of, output, value, of, the, total, sales, of, goods, and, services, plus, the, value, of, changes, in, the, inventory, the, sum, of, the, gross, value, added, in, the, various, economic, activities, is, known, as, gdp, at, factor, cost, gdp, at, factor, cost, plus, indirect, taxes, fewer, subsidies, on, products, gdp, at, producer, price, for, measuring, the, output, of, domestic, product, economic, activities, i, e, industries, are, classified, into, various, sectors, after, classifying, economic, activities, the, output, of, each, sector, is, calculated, by, any, of, the, following, two, methods, the, value, of, output, of, all, sectors, is, then, added, to, get, the, gross, value, of, output, at, factor, cost, subtracting, each, sector, s, intermediate, consumption, from, gross, output, value, gives, the, gva, gdp, at, factor, cost, adding, indirect, tax, minus, subsidies, to, gva, gdp, at, factor, cost, gives, the, gva, gdp, at, producer, prices, the, second, way, of, estimating, gdp, is, to, use, the, sum, of, primary, incomes, distributed, by, resident, producer, units, if, gdp, is, calculated, this, way, it, is, sometimes, called, gross, domestic, income, gdi, or, gdp, i, gdi, should, provide, the, same, amount, as, the, expenditure, method, described, later, by, definition, gdi, is, equal, to, gdp, in, practice, however, measurement, errors, will, make, the, two, figures, slightly, off, when, reported, by, national, statistical, agencies, this, method, measures, gdp, by, adding, incomes, that, firms, pay, households, for, factors, of, production, they, hire, wages, for, labour, interest, for, capital, rent, for, land, and, profits, for, entrepreneurship, the, us, national, income, and, product, accounts, divide, incomes, into, five, categories, these, five, income, components, sum, to, net, domestic, income, at, factor, cost, two, adjustments, must, be, made, to, get, gdp, total, income, can, be, subdivided, according, to, various, schemes, leading, to, various, formulae, for, gdp, measured, by, the, income, approach, a, common, one, is, the, sum, of, coe, gos, and, gmi, is, called, total, factor, income, it, is, the, income, of, all, of, the, factors, of, production, in, society, it, measures, the, value, of, gdp, at, factor, basic, prices, the, difference, between, basic, prices, and, final, prices, those, used, in, the, expenditure, calculation, is, the, total, taxes, and, subsidies, that, the, government, has, levied, or, paid, on, that, production, so, adding, taxes, less, subsidies, on, production, and, imports, converts, gdp, i, at, factor, cost, to, gdp, i, at, final, prices, total, factor, income, is, also, sometimes, expressed, as, the, third, way, to, estimate, gdp, is, to, calculate, the, sum, of, the, final, uses, of, goods, and, services, all, uses, except, intermediate, consumption, measured, in, purchasers, prices, market, goods, that, are, produced, are, purchased, by, someone, in, the, case, where, a, good, is, produced, and, unsold, the, standard, accounting, convention, is, that, the, producer, has, bought, the, good, from, themselves, therefore, measuring, the, total, expenditure, used, to, buy, things, is, a, way, of, measuring, production, this, is, known, as, the, expenditure, method, of, calculating, gdp, gdp, y, is, the, sum, of, consumption, c, investment, i, government, expenditures, g, and, net, exports, x, m, here, is, a, description, of, each, gdp, component, c, i, and, g, are, expenditures, on, final, goods, and, services, expenditures, on, intermediate, goods, and, services, do, not, count, intermediate, goods, and, services, are, those, used, by, businesses, to, produce, other, goods, and, services, within, the, accounting, year, so, for, example, if, a, car, manufacturer, buys, auto, parts, assembles, the, car, and, sells, it, only, the, final, car, sold, is, counted, towards, the, gdp, meanwhile, if, a, person, buys, replacement, auto, parts, to, install, them, on, their, car, those, are, counted, towards, the, gdp, according, to, the, u, s, bureau, of, economic, analysis, which, is, responsible, for, calculating, the, national, accounts, in, the, united, states, in, general, the, source, data, for, the, expenditures, components, are, considered, more, reliable, than, those, for, the, income, components, encyclopedia, britannica, records, an, alternate, way, of, measuring, exports, minus, imports, notating, it, as, the, single, variable, nx, gdp, can, be, contrasted, with, gross, national, product, gnp, or, as, it, is, now, known, gross, national, income, gni, the, difference, is, that, gdp, defines, its, scope, according, to, location, while, gni, defines, its, scope, according, to, ownership, in, a, global, context, world, gdp, and, world, gni, are, therefore, equivalent, terms, gdp, is, a, product, produced, within, a, country, s, borders, gni, is, product, produced, by, enterprises, owned, by, a, country, s, citizens, the, two, would, be, the, same, if, all, of, the, productive, enterprises, in, a, country, were, owned, by, its, own, citizens, and, those, citizens, did, not, own, productive, enterprises, in, any, other, countries, in, practice, however, foreign, ownership, makes, gdp, and, gni, non, identical, production, within, a, country, s, borders, but, by, an, enterprise, owned, by, somebody, outside, the, country, counts, as, part, of, its, gdp, but, not, its, gni, on, the, other, hand, production, by, an, enterprise, located, outside, the, country, but, owned, by, one, of, its, citizens, counts, as, part, of, its, gni, but, not, its, gdp, for, example, the, gni, of, the, us, is, the, value, of, output, produced, by, american, owned, firms, regardless, of, where, the, firms, are, located, similarly, if, a, country, becomes, increasingly, in, debt, and, spends, large, amounts, of, income, servicing, this, debt, this, will, be, reflected, in, a, decreased, gni, but, not, a, decreased, gdp, similarly, if, a, country, sells, off, its, resources, to, entities, outside, their, country, this, will, also, be, reflected, over, time, in, decreased, gni, but, not, decreased, gdp, this, would, make, the, use, of, gdp, more, attractive, for, politicians, in, countries, with, increasing, national, debt, and, decreasing, assets, gross, national, income, gni, equals, gdp, plus, income, receipts, from, the, rest, of, the, world, minus, income, payments, to, the, rest, of, the, world, in, 1991, the, united, states, switched, from, using, gnp, to, using, gdp, as, its, primary, measure, of, production, the, relationship, between, united, states, gdp, and, gnp, is, shown, in, table, 1, 7, 5, of, the, national, income, and, product, accounts, another, example, that, amplifies, the, difference, between, gdp, and, gni, is, the, comparison, of, developed, and, developing, country, indicators, the, gdp, of, japan, for, 2020, is, 5, 040, 107, 75, usd, in, a, million, predictably, as, a, developed, country, japan, has, a, higher, gni, by, 182, 779, 46, in, millions, of, usd, which, is, indicative, that, the, production, level, in, the, country, is, higher, than, that, of, national, production, on, the, other, hand, the, case, with, armenia, is, the, opposite, with, gdp, being, lower, than, gni, by, 196, 12, usd, in, million, this, demonstrates, that, countries, receive, investments, and, foreign, aid, from, abroad, the, total, income, divided, by, the, population, is, the, per, capita, income, the, international, standard, for, measuring, gdp, is, contained, in, the, book, system, of, national, accounts, 2008, which, was, prepared, by, representatives, of, the, international, monetary, fund, european, union, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, united, nations, and, world, bank, the, publication, is, normally, referred, to, as, sna2008, to, distinguish, it, from, the, previous, edition, published, in, 1993, sna93, or, 1968, called, sna68, sna2008, provides, a, set, of, rules, and, procedures, for, the, measurement, of, national, accounts, the, standards, are, designed, to, be, flexible, to, allow, for, differences, in, local, statistical, needs, and, conditions, within, each, country, gdp, is, normally, measured, by, a, national, government, statistical, agency, as, private, sector, organizations, normally, do, not, have, access, to, the, information, required, especially, information, on, expenditure, and, production, by, governments, the, raw, gdp, figure, as, given, by, the, equations, above, is, called, the, nominal, historical, or, current, gdp, when, one, compares, gdp, figures, from, one, year, to, another, it, is, desirable, to, compensate, for, changes, in, the, value, of, money, for, the, effects, of, inflation, or, deflation, to, make, it, more, meaningful, for, year, to, year, comparisons, it, may, be, multiplied, by, the, ratio, between, the, value, of, money, in, the, year, the, gdp, was, measured, and, the, value, of, money, in, a, base, year, for, example, suppose, a, country, s, gdp, in, 1990, was, 100, million, and, its, gdp, in, 2000, was, 300, million, suppose, also, that, inflation, had, halved, the, value, of, its, currency, over, that, period, to, meaningfully, compare, its, gdp, in, 2000, to, its, gdp, in, 1990, we, could, multiply, the, gdp, in, 2000, by, one, half, to, make, it, relative, to, 1990, as, a, base, year, the, result, would, be, that, the, gdp, in, 2000, equals, 300, million, 1, 2, 150, million, in, 1990, monetary, terms, we, would, see, that, the, country, s, gdp, had, realistically, increased, 50, percent, over, that, period, not, 200, percent, as, it, might, appear, from, the, raw, gdp, data, the, gdp, adjusted, for, changes, in, money, value, in, this, way, is, called, the, real, gdp, the, factor, used, to, convert, gdp, from, current, to, constant, values, in, this, way, is, called, the, gdp, deflator, unlike, consumer, price, index, which, measures, inflation, or, deflation, in, the, price, of, household, consumer, goods, the, gdp, deflator, measures, changes, in, the, prices, of, all, domestically, produced, goods, and, services, in, an, economy, including, investment, goods, and, government, services, as, well, as, household, consumption, goods, real, gdp, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, gdp, growth, rate, which, indicates, how, much, a, country, s, production, has, increased, or, decreased, if, the, growth, rate, is, negative, compared, to, the, previous, year, typically, expressed, as, percentage, change, the, economic, growth, can, be, expressed, as, real, gdp, growth, rate, or, real, gdp, per, capita, growth, rate, gdp, can, be, adjusted, for, population, growth, also, called, per, capita, gdp, or, gdp, per, person, this, measures, the, average, production, of, a, person, in, the, country, gdp, per, capita, is, often, used, as, an, indicator, of, living, standards, the, major, advantage, of, gdp, per, capita, as, an, indicator, of, the, standard, of, living, is, that, it, is, measured, frequently, widely, and, consistently, it, is, measured, frequently, in, that, most, countries, provide, information, on, gdp, every, quarter, allowing, trends, to, be, seen, quickly, it, is, measured, widely, in, that, some, measure, of, gdp, is, available, for, almost, every, country, in, the, world, allowing, inter, country, comparisons, it, is, measured, consistently, in, that, the, technical, definition, of, gdp, is, relatively, consistent, among, countries, gdp, does, not, include, several, factors, that, influence, the, standard, of, living, in, particular, it, fails, to, account, for, it, can, be, argued, that, gdp, per, capita, as, an, indicator, of, standard, of, living, is, correlated, with, these, factors, capturing, them, indirectly, as, a, result, gdp, per, capita, as, a, standard, of, living, is, a, continued, usage, because, most, people, have, a, fairly, accurate, idea, of, what, it, is, and, know, it, is, tough, to, come, up, with, quantitative, measures, for, such, constructs, as, happiness, quality, of, life, and, well, being, from, the, perspective, of, environmental, social, and, governance, esg, measures, gdp, per, capita, trends, can, be, influenced, by, factors, such, as, gender, parity, and, elements, of, regulatory, quality, in, an, example, of, a, developing, country, with, a, mixed, economy, from, 2008, to, 2021, elements, such, as, the, per, capita, gross, domestic, product, and, the, unemployment, rate, have, a, significant, effect, on, the, number, of, msmes, in, the, philippines, simon, kuznets, the, economist, who, developed, the, first, comprehensive, set, of, measures, of, national, income, stated, in, his, second, report, to, the, u, s, congress, in, 1937, in, a, section, titled, uses, and, abuses, of, national, income, measurements, the, valuable, capacity, of, the, human, mind, to, simplify, a, complex, situation, in, a, compact, characterization, becomes, dangerous, when, not, controlled, in, terms, of, definitely, stated, criteria, with, quantitative, measurements, especially, the, definiteness, of, the, result, suggests, often, misleadingly, a, precision, and, simplicity, in, the, outlines, of, the, object, measured, measurements, of, national, income, are, subject, to, this, type, of, illusion, and, resulting, abuse, especially, since, they, deal, with, matters, that, are, the, center, of, conflict, of, opposing, social, groups, where, the, effectiveness, of, an, argument, is, often, contingent, upon, oversimplification, all, these, qualifications, upon, estimates, of, national, income, as, an, index, of, productivity, are, just, as, important, when, income, measurements, are, interpreted, from, the, point, of, view, of, economic, welfare, but, in, the, latter, case, additional, difficulties, will, be, suggested, to, anyone, who, wants, to, penetrate, below, the, surface, of, total, figures, and, market, values, economic, welfare, cannot, be, adequately, measured, unless, the, personal, distribution, of, income, is, known, and, no, income, measurement, undertakes, to, estimate, the, reverse, side, of, income, that, is, the, intensity, and, unpleasantness, of, effort, going, into, the, earning, of, income, the, welfare, of, a, nation, can, therefore, scarcely, be, inferred, from, a, measurement, of, national, income, as, defined, above, in, 1962, kuznets, stated, distinctions, must, be, kept, in, mind, between, quantity, and, quality, of, growth, between, costs, and, returns, and, between, the, short, and, long, run, goals, for, more, growth, should, specify, more, growth, of, what, and, for, what, ever, since, the, development, of, gdp, multiple, observers, have, pointed, out, limitations, of, using, gdp, as, the, overarching, measure, of, economic, and, social, progress, for, example, many, environmentalists, argue, that, gdp, is, a, poor, measure, of, social, progress, because, it, does, not, take, into, account, harm, to, the, environment, furthermore, the, gdp, does, not, consider, human, health, nor, the, educational, aspect, of, a, population, american, politician, robert, f, kennedy, criticized, the, gdp, as, a, measure, of, everything, except, that, which, makes, life, worthwhile, he, said, that, it, does, not, allow, for, the, health, of, our, children, the, quality, of, their, education, or, the, joy, of, their, play, although, a, high, or, rising, level, of, gdp, is, often, associated, with, increased, economic, and, social, progress, the, opposite, sometimes, occurs, for, example, jean, dr, ze, and, amartya, sen, have, pointed, out, that, an, increase, in, gdp, or, in, gdp, growth, does, not, necessarily, lead, to, a, higher, standard, of, living, particularly, in, areas, such, as, healthcare, and, education, another, important, area, that, does, not, necessarily, improve, along, with, gdp, is, political, liberty, which, is, most, notable, in, china, where, gdp, growth, is, strong, yet, political, liberties, are, heavily, restricted, gdp, does, not, account, for, the, distribution, of, income, among, the, residents, of, a, country, because, gdp, is, merely, an, aggregate, measure, an, economy, may, be, highly, developed, or, growing, rapidly, but, also, contain, a, wide, gap, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, in, a, society, these, inequalities, often, occur, on, the, lines, of, race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or, other, minority, status, within, countries, this, can, lead, to, misleading, characterizations, of, economic, well, being, if, the, income, distribution, is, heavily, skewed, toward, the, high, end, as, the, poorer, residents, will, not, directly, benefit, from, the, overall, level, of, wealth, and, income, generated, in, their, country, their, purchasing, power, can, decline, even, as, the, mean, gdp, per, capita, rises, gdp, per, capita, measures, like, aggregate, gdp, measures, do, not, account, for, income, distribution, and, tend, to, overstate, the, average, income, per, capita, for, example, south, africa, during, apartheid, ranked, high, in, terms, of, gdp, per, capita, but, the, benefits, of, this, immense, wealth, and, income, were, not, shared, equally, among, its, citizens, an, inequality, which, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 10, amongst, other, global, initiatives, aims, to, address, gdp, excludes, the, value, of, household, and, other, unpaid, work, some, including, martha, nussbaum, argue, that, this, value, should, be, included, in, measuring, gdp, as, household, labor, is, largely, a, substitute, for, goods, and, services, that, would, otherwise, be, purchased, with, money, even, under, conservative, estimates, the, value, of, unpaid, labor, in, australia, has, been, calculated, to, be, over, 50, of, the, country, s, gdp, a, later, study, analyzed, this, value, in, other, countries, with, results, ranging, from, a, low, of, about, 15, in, canada, using, conservative, estimates, to, high, of, nearly, 70, in, the, united, kingdom, using, more, liberal, estimates, for, the, united, states, the, value, was, estimated, to, be, between, about, 20, on, the, low, end, to, nearly, 50, on, the, high, end, depending, on, the, methodology, being, used, because, many, public, policies, are, shaped, by, gdp, calculations, and, by, the, related, field, of, national, accounts, public, policy, might, differ, if, unpaid, work, were, included, in, total, gdp, some, economists, have, advocated, for, changes, in, the, way, public, policies, are, formed, and, implemented, the, uk, s, natural, capital, committee, highlighted, the, shortcomings, of, gdp, in, its, advice, to, the, uk, government, in, 2013, pointing, out, that, gdp, focuses, on, flows, not, stocks, as, a, result, an, economy, can, run, down, its, assets, yet, at, the, same, time, record, high, levels, of, gdp, growth, until, a, point, is, reached, where, the, depleted, assets, act, as, a, check, on, future, growth, they, then, went, on, to, say, that, it, is, apparent, that, the, recorded, gdp, growth, rate, overstates, the, sustainable, growth, rate, broader, measures, of, wellbeing, and, wealth, are, needed, for, this, and, there, is, a, danger, that, short, term, decisions, based, solely, on, what, is, currently, measured, by, national, accounts, may, prove, to, be, costly, in, the, long, term, it, has, been, suggested, that, countries, that, have, authoritarian, governments, such, as, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, russia, inflate, their, gdp, figures, instances, of, gdp, measures, have, been, considered, numbers, that, are, artificial, constructs, in, 2020, scientists, as, part, of, a, world, scientists, warning, to, humanity, associated, series, warned, that, worldwide, growth, in, affluence, in, terms, of, gdp, metrics, has, increased, resource, use, and, pollutant, emissions, with, affluent, citizens, of, the, world, in, terms, of, e, g, resource, intensive, consumption, being, responsible, for, most, negative, environmental, impacts, and, central, to, a, transition, to, safer, sustainable, conditions, they, summarised, evidence, presented, solution, approaches, and, stated, that, far, reaching, lifestyle, changes, need, to, complement, technological, advancements, and, that, existing, societies, economies, and, cultures, incite, consumption, expansion, and, that, the, structural, imperative, for, growth, in, competitive, market, economies, inhibits, societal, change, sarah, arnold, senior, economist, at, the, new, economics, foundation, nef, stated, that, gdp, includes, activities, that, are, detrimental, to, our, economy, and, society, in, the, long, term, such, as, deforestation, strip, mining, overfishing, and, so, on, the, number, of, trees, that, are, net, lost, annually, is, estimated, to, be, approximately, 10, billion, the, global, average, annual, deforested, land, in, the, 2015, 2020, demi, decade, was, 10, million, hectares, and, the, average, annual, net, forest, area, loss, in, the, 2000, 2010, decade, 4, 7, million, hectares, according, to, the, global, forest, resources, assessment, 2020, according, to, one, study, depending, on, the, level, of, wealth, inequality, higher, gdp, growth, can, be, associated, with, more, deforestation, in, 2019, agriculture, and, agribusiness, accounted, for, 24, of, the, gdp, of, brazil, where, a, large, share, of, annual, net, tropical, forest, loss, occurred, and, is, associated, with, sizable, portions, of, this, economic, activity, domain, the, number, of, obese, adults, was, approximately, 600, million, 12, in, 2015, in, 2013, scientists, reported, that, large, improvements, in, health, only, lead, to, modest, long, term, increases, in, gdp, per, capita, after, developing, an, abstract, metric, similar, to, gdp, the, center, for, partnership, studies, highlighted, that, gdp, and, other, metrics, that, reflect, and, perpetuate, them, may, not, be, useful, for, facilitating, the, production, of, products, and, provision, of, services, that, are, useful, or, comparatively, more, useful, to, society, and, instead, may, actually, encourage, rather, than, discourage, destructive, activities, steve, cohen, of, the, earth, institute, elucidated, that, while, gdp, does, not, distinguish, between, different, activities, or, lifestyles, all, consumption, behaviors, are, not, created, equal, and, do, not, have, the, same, impact, on, environmental, sustainability, johan, rockstr, m, director, of, the, potsdam, institute, for, climate, impact, research, noted, that, it, s, difficult, to, see, if, the, current, g, d, p, based, model, of, economic, growth, can, go, hand, in, hand, with, rapid, cutting, of, emissions, which, nations, have, agreed, to, attempt, under, the, paris, agreement, in, order, to, mitigate, real, world, impacts, of, climate, change, some, have, pointed, out, that, gdp, did, not, adapt, to, sociotechnical, changes, to, give, a, more, accurate, picture, of, the, modern, economy, and, does, not, encapsulate, the, value, of, new, activities, such, as, delivering, price, free, information, and, entertainment, on, social, media, in, 2017, diane, coyle, explained, that, gdp, excludes, much, unpaid, work, writing, that, many, people, contribute, free, digital, work, such, as, writing, open, source, software, that, can, substitute, for, marketed, equivalents, and, it, clearly, has, great, economic, value, despite, a, price, of, zero, which, constitutes, a, common, criticism, of, the, reliance, on, gdp, as, the, measure, of, economic, success, especially, after, the, emergence, of, the, digital, economy, similarly, gdp, does, not, value, or, distinguish, for, environmental, protection, a, 2020, study, found, that, poor, regions, gdp, grows, faster, by, attracting, more, polluting, production, after, connection, to, china, s, expressway, system, gdp, may, not, be, a, tool, capable, of, recognizing, how, much, natural, capital, agents, of, the, economy, are, building, or, protecting, in, response, to, these, and, other, limitations, of, using, gdp, alternative, approaches, have, emerged, a, peer, reviewed, study, published, in, the, journal, of, political, economy, in, october, 2022, found, signs, of, manipulation, of, economic, growth, statistics, in, the, majority, of, countries, according, to, the, study, this, mainly, applied, to, countries, that, were, governed, semi, authoritarian, authoritarian, or, did, not, have, a, functioning, separation, of, powers, the, study, took, the, annual, growth, in, the, brightness, of, lights, at, night, as, measured, by, satellites, and, compared, it, to, officially, reported, economic, growth, authoritarian, states, had, consistently, higher, reported, growth, in, gdp, than, their, growth, in, night, lights, would, suggest, an, effect, that, also, cannot, be, explained, by, different, economic, structures, sector, composition, or, other, factors, incorrect, growth, statistics, can, also, falsify, indicators, such, as, gdp, or, gdp, per, capita, global, data, articles, and, books, top, country, subdivisions, by, gdp, top, country, subdivisions, by, gdp, per, capita, top, country, metropolitan,
