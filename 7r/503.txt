a, lawsuit, is, a, proceeding, by, one, or, more, parties, the, plaintiff, or, claimant, against, one, or, more, parties, the, defendant, in, a, civil, court, of, law, the, archaic, term, suit, in, law, is, found, in, only, a, small, number, of, laws, still, in, effect, today, the, term, lawsuit, is, used, with, respect, to, a, civil, action, brought, by, a, plaintiff, a, party, who, claims, to, have, incurred, loss, as, a, result, of, a, defendant, s, actions, who, requests, a, legal, remedy, or, equitable, remedy, from, a, court, the, defendant, is, required, to, respond, to, the, plaintiff, s, complaint, or, else, risk, default, judgment, if, the, plaintiff, is, successful, judgment, is, entered, in, favor, of, the, plaintiff, and, the, court, may, impose, the, legal, and, or, equitable, remedies, available, against, the, defendant, respondent, a, variety, of, court, orders, may, be, issued, in, connection, with, or, as, part, of, the, judgment, to, enforce, a, right, award, damages, or, restitution, or, impose, a, temporary, or, permanent, injunction, to, prevent, an, act, or, compel, an, act, a, declaratory, judgment, may, be, issued, to, prevent, future, legal, disputes, a, lawsuit, may, involve, resolution, of, disputes, involving, issues, of, private, law, between, individuals, business, entities, or, non, profit, organizations, a, lawsuit, may, also, involve, issues, of, public, law, in, the, sense, that, the, state, is, treated, as, if, it, were, a, private, party, in, a, civil, case, either, as, a, plaintiff, with, a, civil, cause, of, action, to, enforce, certain, laws, or, as, a, defendant, in, actions, contesting, the, legality, of, the, state, s, laws, or, seeking, monetary, damages, for, injuries, caused, by, agents, of, the, state, conducting, a, civil, action, is, called, litigation, the, plaintiffs, and, defendants, are, called, litigants, and, the, attorneys, representing, them, are, called, litigators, the, term, litigation, may, also, refer, to, the, conducting, of, criminal, actions, see, criminal, procedure, the, word, lawsuit, derives, from, the, combination, of, law, and, suit, suit, derives, from, the, old, french, suite, sieute, meaning, to, pursue, or, follow, this, term, was, derived, from, the, latin, secutus, the, past, participle, of, sequi, meaning, to, attend, or, follow, similarly, the, word, sue, derives, from, the, old, french, suir, sivre, meaning, to, pursue, or, follow, after, this, was, also, derived, from, the, latin, word, sequi, rules, of, criminal, or, civil, procedure, govern, the, conduct, of, a, lawsuit, in, the, common, law, adversarial, system, of, dispute, resolution, procedural, rules, arise, from, statutory, law, case, law, and, constitutional, provisions, especially, the, right, to, due, process, the, details, of, each, kind, of, legal, procedure, differ, greatly, from, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, and, often, from, court, to, court, even, within, the, same, jurisdiction, it, is, important, for, litigants, to, be, aware, of, all, relevant, procedural, rules, or, to, hire, competent, counsel, who, can, either, comply, with, such, rules, on, their, behalf, or, explain, the, rules, to, them, because, the, litigants, ultimately, dictate, the, timing, and, progression, of, the, lawsuit, litigants, are, responsible, for, obtaining, the, desired, result, and, the, timing, of, reaching, this, result, failure, to, comply, with, procedural, rules, may, result, in, serious, limitations, that, can, affect, the, ability, of, one, to, present, claims, or, defenses, at, any, subsequent, trial, or, even, lead, to, the, dismissal, of, the, lawsuit, altogether, though, the, majority, of, lawsuits, are, settled, before, ever, reaching, trial, they, can, still, be, very, complicated, to, litigate, this, is, particularly, true, in, federal, systems, where, a, federal, court, may, be, applying, state, law, e, g, the, erie, doctrine, for, example, in, the, united, states, or, vice, versa, it, is, also, possible, for, one, state, to, apply, the, law, of, another, in, cases, where, additionally, it, may, not, be, clear, which, level, or, location, of, court, actually, has, jurisdiction, over, the, claim, or, personal, jurisdiction, over, the, defendant, or, whether, the, plaintiff, has, standing, to, participate, in, a, lawsuit, about, 98, percent, of, civil, cases, in, the, united, states, federal, courts, are, resolved, without, a, trial, domestic, courts, are, also, often, called, upon, to, apply, foreign, law, or, to, act, upon, foreign, defendants, over, whom, they, may, not, even, have, the, ability, to, enforce, a, judgment, if, the, defendant, s, assets, are, theoretically, outside, their, reach, lawsuits, can, become, additionally, complicated, as, more, parties, become, involved, see, joinder, within, a, single, lawsuit, there, can, be, any, number, of, claims, and, defenses, all, based, on, numerous, laws, between, any, number, of, plaintiffs, or, defendants, each, of, these, participants, can, bring, any, number, of, cross, claims, and, counterclaims, against, each, other, and, even, bring, additional, parties, into, the, suit, on, either, side, after, it, progresses, in, reality, however, courts, typically, have, some, power, to, sever, claims, and, parties, into, separate, actions, if, it, is, more, efficient, to, do, so, a, court, can, do, this, if, there, is, not, a, sufficient, overlap, of, factual, issues, between, the, various, associates, separating, the, issues, into, different, lawsuits, the, official, ruling, of, a, lawsuit, can, be, somewhat, misleading, because, post, ruling, outcomes, are, often, not, listed, on, the, internet, for, example, in, the, case, of, william, j, ralph, jr, v, lind, waldock, company, september, 1999, one, would, assume, that, ralph, lost, the, case, when, in, fact, upon, review, of, the, evidence, it, was, found, that, ralph, was, correct, in, his, assertion, that, improper, activity, took, place, on, the, part, of, lind, waldock, and, ralph, settled, with, lind, waldock, cases, such, as, this, illustrate, the, need, for, more, comprehensive, information, than, mere, internet, searches, when, researching, legal, decisions, while, online, searches, are, appropriate, for, many, legal, situations, they, are, not, appropriate, for, all, the, following, is, a, generalized, description, of, how, a, lawsuit, may, proceed, in, a, common, law, jurisdiction, a, lawsuit, begins, when, a, complaint, or, petition, known, as, a, pleading, is, filed, with, the, court, a, complaint, should, explicitly, state, that, one, or, more, plaintiffs, seek, s, damages, or, equitable, relief, from, one, or, more, stated, defendants, and, also, should, state, the, relevant, factual, allegations, supporting, the, legal, claims, brought, by, the, plaintiffs, as, the, initial, pleading, a, complaint, is, the, most, important, step, in, a, civil, case, because, a, complaint, sets, the, factual, and, legal, foundation, for, the, entirety, of, a, case, while, complaints, and, other, pleadings, may, ordinarily, be, amended, by, a, motion, with, the, court, the, complaint, sets, the, framework, for, the, entire, case, and, the, claims, that, will, be, asserted, throughout, the, entire, lawsuit, it, is, likewise, important, that, the, plaintiff, select, the, proper, venue, with, the, proper, jurisdiction, to, bring, the, lawsuit, the, clerk, of, a, court, signs, or, stamps, the, court, seal, upon, a, summons, or, citation, which, is, then, served, by, the, plaintiff, upon, the, defendant, together, with, a, copy, of, the, complaint, this, service, notifies, the, defendants, that, they, are, being, sued, and, that, they, are, limited, in, the, amount, of, time, to, reply, the, service, provides, a, copy, of, the, complaint, in, order, to, notify, the, defendants, of, the, nature, of, the, claims, once, the, defendants, are, served, with, the, summons, and, complaint, they, are, subject, to, a, time, limit, to, file, an, answer, stating, their, defenses, to, the, plaintiff, s, claims, which, includes, any, challenges, to, the, court, s, jurisdiction, and, any, counterclaims, they, wish, to, assert, against, the, plaintiff, in, a, handful, of, jurisdictions, notably, the, u, s, state, of, new, york, a, lawsuit, begins, when, one, or, more, plaintiffs, properly, serve, a, summons, and, complaint, upon, the, defendants, in, such, jurisdictions, nothing, must, be, filed, with, the, court, until, a, dispute, develops, requiring, actual, judicial, intervention, if, the, defendant, chooses, to, file, an, answer, within, the, time, permitted, the, answer, must, address, each, of, the, plaintiffs, allegations, the, defendant, has, three, choices, to, make, which, include, either, admitting, to, the, allegation, denying, it, or, pleading, a, lack, of, sufficient, information, to, admit, or, deny, the, allegation, some, jurisdictions, like, california, and, florida, still, authorize, general, denials, of, each, and, every, allegation, in, the, complaint, at, the, time, the, defendant, files, an, answer, the, defendant, also, raises, all, affirmative, defenses, the, defendant, may, also, assert, counterclaims, for, damages, or, equitable, relief, against, the, plaintiff, for, example, in, the, case, of, compulsory, counterclaims, the, defendant, must, assert, some, form, of, counterclaim, or, risk, having, the, counterclaim, barred, in, any, subsequent, proceeding, in, the, case, of, making, a, counterclaim, the, defendant, is, making, a, motion, directed, towards, the, plaintiff, claiming, that, he, she, was, injured, in, some, way, or, would, like, to, sue, the, plaintiff, the, plaintiff, in, this, example, would, then, receive, some, amount, of, time, to, make, a, reply, to, this, counterclaim, the, defendant, may, also, file, a, third, party, complaint, which, is, the, defendant, s, privilege, to, join, another, party, or, parties, in, the, action, with, the, belief, that, those, parties, may, be, liable, for, some, or, all, of, the, plaintiff, s, claimed, damages, an, answer, from, the, defendant, in, response, to, the, claims, made, against, him, her, can, also, include, additional, facts, or, a, so, called, excuse, for, the, plead, filing, an, answer, joins, the, cause, and, moves, the, case, into, the, pre, trial, phase, instead, of, filing, an, answer, within, the, time, specified, in, the, summons, the, defendant, can, choose, to, dispute, the, validity, of, the, complaint, by, filing, a, demurrer, in, the, handful, of, jurisdictions, where, that, is, still, allowed, or, one, or, more, pre, answer, motions, such, as, a, motion, to, dismiss, it, is, important, that, the, motion, be, filed, within, the, time, period, specified, in, the, summons, for, an, answer, if, all, of, the, above, motions, are, denied, by, the, trial, court, and, the, defendant, loses, on, all, appeals, from, such, denials, if, that, option, is, available, and, finally, the, defendant, must, file, an, answer, usually, the, pleadings, are, drafted, by, a, lawyer, but, in, many, courts, persons, can, file, papers, and, represent, themselves, which, is, called, appearing, pro, se, many, courts, have, a, pro, se, clerk, to, assist, people, without, lawyers, a, pretrial, discovery, can, be, defined, as, the, formal, process, of, exchanging, information, between, the, parties, about, the, witnesses, and, evidence, they, ll, present, at, trial, and, allows, for, the, evidence, of, the, trial, to, be, presented, to, the, parties, before, the, initial, trial, begins, the, early, stages, of, the, lawsuit, may, involve, initial, disclosures, of, evidence, by, each, party, and, discovery, which, is, the, structured, exchange, of, evidence, and, statements, between, the, parties, discovery, is, meant, to, eliminate, surprises, clarify, what, the, lawsuit, is, about, and, also, to, make, the, parties, decide, if, they, should, settle, or, drop, frivolous, claims, or, defenses, at, this, point, the, parties, may, also, engage, in, pretrial, motions, to, exclude, or, include, particular, legal, or, factual, issues, before, trial, there, is, also, the, ability, of, one, to, make, an, under, oath, statement, during, the, pretrial, also, known, as, a, deposition, the, deposition, can, be, used, in, the, trial, or, just, in, the, pretrial, but, this, allows, for, both, parties, to, be, aware, of, the, arguments, or, claims, that, are, going, to, be, made, by, the, other, party, in, the, trial, it, is, notable, that, the, depositions, can, be, written, or, oral, at, the, close, of, discovery, the, parties, may, either, pick, a, jury, and, then, have, a, trial, by, jury, or, the, case, may, proceed, as, a, bench, trial, a, bench, trial, is, only, heard, by, the, judge, if, the, parties, waive, a, jury, trial, or, if, the, right, to, a, jury, trial, is, not, guaranteed, for, their, particular, claim, such, as, those, under, equity, in, the, u, s, or, for, any, lawsuits, within, their, jurisdiction, usually, lawsuits, end, in, a, settlement, with, an, empirical, analysis, finding, that, less, than, 2, of, cases, end, with, a, trial, it, is, sometimes, said, that, 95, of, cases, end, in, settlement, few, jurisdictions, report, settlements, but, empirical, analysis, suggests, that, the, settlement, rate, varies, by, type, of, lawsuit, with, torts, settling, around, 90, of, the, time, and, overall, civil, cases, settling, 50, of, the, time, other, cases, end, due, to, default, judgment, lack, of, a, valid, claim, and, other, reasons, at, trial, each, person, presents, witnesses, and, the, evidence, collected, is, recorded, after, this, occurs, the, judge, or, jury, renders, their, decision, generally, speaking, the, plaintiff, has, the, burden, of, proof, in, making, his, claims, however, the, defendant, may, have, the, burden, of, proof, on, other, issues, such, as, affirmative, defenses, the, attorneys, are, held, responsible, in, devising, a, trial, strategy, that, ensures, they, meet, the, necessary, elements, of, their, case, or, when, the, opposing, party, has, the, burden, of, proof, to, ensure, the, opponent, will, not, be, able, to, meet, his, or, her, burden, there, are, numerous, motions, that, either, party, can, file, throughout, the, lawsuit, to, terminate, it, prematurely, before, submission, to, the, judge, or, jury, for, final, consideration, these, motions, attempt, to, persuade, the, judge, through, legal, argument, and, sometimes, accompanying, evidence, that, there, is, no, reasonable, way, that, the, other, party, could, legally, win, and, therefore, there, is, no, sense, in, continuing, with, the, trial, motions, for, summary, judgment, for, example, can, usually, be, brought, before, after, or, during, the, actual, presentation, of, the, case, motions, can, also, be, brought, after, the, close, of, a, trial, to, undo, a, jury, verdict, contrary, to, law, or, against, the, weight, of, the, evidence, or, to, convince, the, judge, to, change, the, decision, or, grant, a, new, trial, also, at, any, time, during, this, process, from, the, filing, of, the, complaint, to, the, final, judgment, the, plaintiff, may, withdraw, the, complaint, and, end, the, whole, matter, or, the, defendant, may, agree, to, a, settlement, if, the, case, settles, the, parties, might, choose, to, enter, into, a, stipulated, judgment, with, the, settlement, agreement, attached, or, the, plaintiff, may, simply, file, a, voluntary, dismissal, so, that, the, settlement, agreement, is, never, entered, into, the, court, record, the, decisions, that, the, jury, makes, are, not, put, into, effect, until, the, judge, makes, a, judgment, which, is, the, approval, to, have, this, trial, information, be, filed, in, public, records, in, a, civil, case, the, judge, is, allowed, at, this, time, to, make, changes, to, the, verdict, that, the, jury, came, up, with, by, either, adding, on, or, reducing, the, punishment, in, criminal, cases, the, situation, is, a, little, different, because, in, this, case, the, judge, does, not, have, the, authority, to, change, the, jury, decision, after, a, final, decision, has, been, made, either, party, or, both, may, appeal, from, the, judgment, if, they, believe, there, had, been, a, procedural, error, made, by, the, trial, court, it, is, not, necessarily, an, automatic, appeal, after, every, judgment, has, been, made, however, if, there, is, a, legal, basis, for, the, appeal, then, one, has, the, right, to, do, so, the, prevailing, party, may, appeal, for, example, if, they, wanted, a, larger, award, than, was, granted, the, appellate, court, which, may, be, structured, as, an, intermediate, appellate, court, and, or, a, higher, court, then, affirms, the, judgment, declines, to, hear, it, which, effectively, affirms, it, reverses, or, vacates, and, remands, this, process, would, then, involve, sending, the, lawsuit, back, to, the, lower, trial, court, to, address, an, unresolved, issue, or, possibly, request, for, a, whole, new, trial, some, lawsuits, go, up, and, down, the, appeals, ladder, repeatedly, before, final, resolution, the, appeal, is, a, review, for, errors, rather, than, a, new, trial, so, the, appellate, court, will, defer, to, the, discretion, of, the, original, trial, court, if, an, error, is, not, clear, the, initial, step, in, making, an, appeal, consists, of, the, petitioner, filing, a, notice, of, appeal, and, then, sending, in, a, brief, a, written, document, stating, reason, for, appeal, to, the, court, decisions, of, the, court, can, be, made, immediately, after, just, reading, the, written, brief, or, there, can, also, be, oral, arguments, made, by, both, parties, involved, in, the, appeal, the, appellate, court, then, makes, the, decision, about, what, errors, were, made, when, the, law, was, looked, at, more, closely, in, the, lower, court, there, were, no, errors, made, the, case, would, then, end, but, if, the, decision, was, reversed, the, appellate, court, would, then, send, the, case, back, down, to, the, lower, court, level, there, a, new, trial, will, be, held, and, new, information, taken, into, account, some, jurisdictions, notably, the, united, states, but, prevalent, in, many, other, countries, prevent, parties, from, relitigating, the, facts, on, appeal, due, to, a, history, of, unscrupulous, lawyers, deliberately, reserving, such, issues, in, order, to, ambush, each, other, in, the, appellate, courts, the, invited, error, problem, the, idea, is, that, it, is, more, efficient, to, force, all, parties, to, fully, litigate, all, relevant, issues, of, fact, before, the, trial, court, thus, a, party, who, does, not, raise, an, issue, of, fact, at, the, trial, court, level, generally, cannot, raise, it, on, appeal, when, the, lawsuit, is, finally, resolved, or, the, allotted, time, to, appeal, has, expired, the, matter, is, res, judicata, meaning, the, plaintiff, may, not, bring, another, action, based, on, the, same, claim, again, in, addition, other, parties, who, later, attempt, to, re, litigate, a, matter, already, ruled, on, in, a, previous, lawsuit, will, be, estopped, from, doing, so, when, a, final, judgment, is, entered, the, plaintiff, is, usually, barred, under, the, doctrine, of, res, judicata, from, relitigating, any, of, the, issues, even, under, different, legal, theories, judgments, are, typically, a, monetary, award, if, the, defendant, fails, to, pay, the, court, has, various, powers, to, seize, any, of, the, defendant, s, assets, located, within, its, jurisdiction, such, as, if, all, assets, are, located, elsewhere, the, plaintiff, must, file, another, suit, in, the, appropriate, court, to, seek, enforcement, of, the, other, court, s, previous, judgment, this, can, be, a, difficult, task, when, crossing, from, a, court, in, one, state, or, nation, to, another, however, courts, tend, to, grant, each, other, respect, when, there, is, not, a, clear, legal, rule, to, the, contrary, a, defendant, who, has, no, assets, in, any, jurisdiction, is, said, to, be, judgment, proof, the, term, is, generally, a, colloquialism, to, describe, an, impecunious, defendant, indigent, judgment, proof, defendants, are, no, longer, imprisoned, debtor, s, prisons, have, been, outlawed, by, statute, constitutional, amendment, or, international, human, rights, treaties, in, the, vast, majority, of, common, law, jurisdictions, scholars, in, law, economics, and, management, have, studied, why, firms, involved, in, a, dispute, choose, between, private, dispute, resolution, such, as, negotiation, mediation, and, arbitration, and, litigation, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, it, was, common, for, lawyers, to, speak, of, bringing, an, action, at, law, and, a, suit, in, equity, an, example, of, that, distinction, survives, today, in, the, codified, text, of, the, ku, klux, klan, act, the, fusion, of, common, law, and, equity, in, england, in, the, judicature, acts, of, 1873, and, 1875, led, to, the, collapse, of, that, distinction, so, it, became, possible, to, speak, of, a, lawsuit, in, the, united, states, the, federal, rules, of, civil, procedure, 1938, abolished, the, distinction, between, actions, at, law, and, suits, in, equity, in, federal, practice, in, favor, of, a, single, form, referred, to, as, a, civil, action, in, england, and, wales, the, term, claim, is, far, more, common, the, person, initiating, proceedings, is, called, the, claimant, england, and, wales, began, to, turn, away, from, traditional, common, law, terminology, with, the, rules, of, the, supreme, court, 1883, in, which, the, statement, of, claim, and, defence, replaced, the, traditional, complaint, and, answer, as, the, pleadings, by, which, parties, placed, their, case, at, issue, before, the, trial, court, american, terminology, is, slightly, different, in, that, the, term, claim, refers, only, to, a, particular, count, or, cause, of, action, alleged, in, a, complaint, similarly, defense, refers, to, only, one, or, more, affirmative, defenses, alleged, in, an, answer, americans, also, use, claim, to, describe, an, extrajudicial, demand, filed, with, an, insurer, or, administrative, agency, if, the, claim, is, denied, then, the, claimant, policyholder, or, applicant, files, a, lawsuit, with, the, courts, to, seek, review, of, that, decision, and, from, that, point, forward, participates, in, the, lawsuit, as, a, plaintiff, in, other, words, the, terms, claimant, and, plaintiff, carry, substantially, different, connotations, of, formality, in, american, english, in, that, only, the, latter, risks, an, award, of, costs, in, favor, of, an, adversary, in, a, lawsuit, in, medieval, times, both, action, and, suit, had, the, approximate, meaning, of, some, kind, of, legal, proceeding, but, an, action, terminated, when, a, judgment, was, rendered, while, a, suit, also, included, the, execution, of, the, judgment, particularly, in, the, united, states, plaintiffs, and, defendants, who, lack, financial, resources, for, litigation, or, other, attorney, s, fees, may, be, able, to, obtain, legal, financing, legal, financing, companies, can, provide, a, cash, advance, to, litigants, in, return, for, a, share, of, the, ultimate, settlement, or, award, if, the, case, ultimately, loses, the, litigant, does, not, have, to, pay, any, of, the, money, funded, back, legal, financing, is, different, from, a, typical, bank, loan, in, that, the, legal, financing, company, does, not, look, at, credit, history, or, employment, history, litigants, do, not, have, to, repay, the, cash, advance, with, monthly, payments, but, do, have, to, fill, out, an, application, so, that, the, legal, financing, company, can, review, the, merits, of, the, case, legal, financing, can, be, a, practical, means, for, litigants, to, obtain, financing, while, they, wait, for, a, monetary, settlement, or, an, award, in, their, personal, injury, workers, compensation, or, civil, rights, lawsuit, often, plaintiffs, who, were, injured, or, forced, to, leave, their, jobs, still, have, mortgages, rent, medical, expenses, or, other, bills, to, pay, other, times, litigants, may, simply, need, money, to, pay, for, the, costs, of, litigation, and, attorneys, fees, and, for, this, reason, many, litigants, turn, to, reputable, legal, financing, companies, to, apply, for, a, cash, advance, to, help, pay, for, bills, defendants, civil, rights, organizations, public, interest, organizations, and, government, public, officials, can, all, set, up, an, account, to, pay, for, litigation, costs, and, legal, expenses, these, legal, defense, funds, can, have, large, membership, counts, where, the, members, contribute, to, the, fund, unlike, legal, financing, from, legal, financing, companies, legal, defense, funds, provide, a, separate, account, for, litigation, rather, than, a, one, time, cash, advancement, nevertheless, both, are, used, for, purposes, of, financing, litigation, and, legal, costs, there, was, a, study, conducted, in, the, supreme, court, economic, review, that, shows, why, litigation, financing, can, be, practical, and, beneficial, to, the, overall, court, system, and, lawsuits, within, the, court, this, study, concluded, that, the, new, rules, that, were, set, for, litigation, financing, actually, did, produce, more, settlements, under, conservative, rules, there, tended, to, be, fewer, settlements, however, under, the, older, rules, they, tended, to, be, larger, on, average, legal, financing, can, become, an, issue, in, some, cases, varying, from, case, to, case, and, person, to, person, it, can, be, beneficial, in, many, situations, however, also, detrimental, in, others
