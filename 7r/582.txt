publisher, will, take, care, of, all, aspects, of, publishing, the, book, at, the, publisher, s, cost, they, rely, entirely, on, sales, of, the, book, to, recoup, those, costs, and, make, a, profit, the, author, receives, a, royalty, on, each, sale, and, sometimes, an, advance, on, royalties, when, the, book, is, accepted, because, of, the, financial, risk, mainstream, publishers, are, extremely,

can, vary, greatly, often, they, do, not, pay, an, advance, on, royalties, a, hybrid, publisher, shares, the, costs, of, publication, and, therefore, the, risks, with, the, author, because, of, this, financial, risk, they, are, selective, in, what, they, publish, the, contract, varies, according, to, what, is, negotiated, between, author, and, company, but, will, always, include, the, surrender, of, some, rights, to, the, publisher, hybrid, publishing, is, the, source, of, debate, in, the, publishing, industry, due, to, the, tendency, of, vanity, presses, to, masquerade, as, hybrids, a,

presses, often, engage, in, deceptive, practices, or, offer, costly, poor, quality, services, with, limited, recourse, available, to, the, writer, in, the, us, these, practices, have, been, cited, by, the, better, business, bureau, as, unfavorable, reports, by, consumers, given, the, bad, reputation, of, vanity, publishing, many, vanity, presses, brand, themselves, as, hybrid, publishers, the,

jointly, published, a, report, to, expose, widespread, bad, practices, among, companies, that, charge, writers, to, publish, their, work, while, taking, away, their, rights, when, an, author, self, publishes, a, book, they, retain, all, rights, and, assume, responsibility, for, all, stages, of, preparing, publishing, and, distributing, the, book, the, author, may, hire, professionals, on, a,
