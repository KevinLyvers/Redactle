evolutionary, psychology, is, a, theoretical, approach, in, psychology, that, examines, cognition, and, behavior, from, a, modern, evolutionary, perspective, it, seeks, to, identify, human, psychological, adaptations, with, regards, to, the, ancestral, problems, they, evolved, to, solve, in, this, framework, psychological, traits, and, mechanisms, are, either, functional, products, of, natural, and, sexual, selection, or, non, adaptive, by, products, of, other, adaptive, traits, adaptationist, thinking, about, physiological, mechanisms, such, as, the, heart, lungs, and, the, liver, is, common, in, evolutionary, biology, evolutionary, psychologists, apply, the, same, thinking, in, psychology, arguing, that, just, as, the, heart, evolved, to, pump, blood, the, liver, evolved, to, detoxify, poisons, and, the, kidneys, evolved, to, filter, turbid, fluids, there, is, modularity, of, mind, in, that, different, psychological, mechanisms, evolved, to, solve, different, adaptive, problems, these, evolutionary, psychologists, argue, that, much, of, human, behavior, is, the, output, of, psychological, adaptations, that, evolved, to, solve, recurrent, problems, in, human, ancestral, environments, some, evolutionary, psychologists, argue, that, evolutionary, theory, can, provide, a, foundational, metatheoretical, framework, that, integrates, the, entire, field, of, psychology, in, the, same, way, evolutionary, biology, has, for, biology, evolutionary, psychologists, hold, that, behaviors, or, traits, that, occur, universally, in, all, cultures, are, good, candidates, for, evolutionary, adaptations, including, the, abilities, to, infer, others, emotions, discern, kin, from, non, kin, identify, and, prefer, healthier, mates, and, cooperate, with, others, findings, have, been, made, regarding, human, social, behaviour, related, to, infanticide, intelligence, marriage, patterns, promiscuity, perception, of, beauty, bride, price, and, parental, investment, the, theories, and, findings, of, evolutionary, psychology, have, applications, in, many, fields, including, economics, environment, health, law, management, psychiatry, politics, and, literature, criticism, of, evolutionary, psychology, involves, questions, of, testability, cognitive, and, evolutionary, assumptions, such, as, modular, functioning, of, the, brain, and, large, uncertainty, about, the, ancestral, environment, importance, of, non, genetic, and, non, adaptive, explanations, as, well, as, political, and, ethical, issues, due, to, interpretations, of, research, results, evolutionary, psychologists, frequently, engage, with, and, respond, to, such, criticisms, its, central, assumption, is, that, the, human, brain, is, composed, of, a, large, number, of, specialized, mechanisms, that, were, shaped, by, natural, selection, over, a, vast, periods, of, time, to, solve, the, recurrent, information, processing, problems, faced, by, our, ancestors, these, problems, involve, food, choices, social, hierarchies, distributing, resources, to, offspring, and, selecting, mates, proponents, suggest, that, it, seeks, to, integrate, psychology, into, the, other, natural, sciences, rooting, it, in, the, organizing, theory, of, biology, evolutionary, theory, and, thus, understanding, psychology, as, a, branch, of, biology, anthropologist, john, tooby, and, psychologist, leda, cosmides, note, evolutionary, psychology, is, the, long, forestalled, scientific, attempt, to, assemble, out, of, the, disjointed, fragmentary, and, mutually, contradictory, human, disciplines, a, single, logically, integrated, research, framework, for, the, psychological, social, and, behavioral, sciences, a, framework, that, not, only, incorporates, the, evolutionary, sciences, on, a, full, and, equal, basis, but, that, systematically, works, out, all, of, the, revisions, in, existing, belief, and, research, practice, that, such, a, synthesis, requires, just, as, human, physiology, and, evolutionary, physiology, have, worked, to, identify, physical, adaptations, of, the, body, that, represent, human, physiological, nature, the, purpose, of, evolutionary, psychology, is, to, identify, evolved, emotional, and, cognitive, adaptations, that, represent, human, psychological, nature, according, to, steven, pinker, it, is, not, a, single, theory, but, a, large, set, of, hypotheses, and, a, term, that, has, also, come, to, refer, to, a, particular, way, of, applying, evolutionary, theory, to, the, mind, with, an, emphasis, on, adaptation, gene, level, selection, and, modularity, evolutionary, psychology, adopts, an, understanding, of, the, mind, that, is, based, on, the, computational, theory, of, mind, it, describes, mental, processes, as, computational, operations, so, that, for, example, a, fear, response, is, described, as, arising, from, a, neurological, computation, that, inputs, the, perceptional, data, e, g, a, visual, image, of, a, spider, and, outputs, the, appropriate, reaction, e, g, fear, of, possibly, dangerous, animals, under, this, view, any, domain, general, learning, is, impossible, because, of, the, combinatorial, explosion, evolutionary, psychology, specifies, the, domain, as, the, problems, of, survival, and, reproduction, while, philosophers, have, generally, considered, the, human, mind, to, include, broad, faculties, such, as, reason, and, lust, evolutionary, psychologists, describe, evolved, psychological, mechanisms, as, narrowly, focused, to, deal, with, specific, issues, such, as, catching, cheaters, or, choosing, mates, the, discipline, sees, the, human, brain, as, having, evolved, specialized, functions, called, cognitive, modules, or, psychological, adaptations, which, are, shaped, by, natural, selection, examples, include, language, acquisition, modules, incest, avoidance, mechanisms, cheater, detection, mechanisms, intelligence, and, sex, specific, mating, preferences, foraging, mechanisms, alliance, tracking, mechanisms, agent, detection, mechanisms, and, others, some, mechanisms, termed, domain, specific, deal, with, recurrent, adaptive, problems, over, the, course, of, human, evolutionary, history, domain, general, mechanisms, on, the, other, hand, are, proposed, to, deal, with, evolutionary, novelty, evolutionary, psychology, has, roots, in, cognitive, psychology, and, evolutionary, biology, but, also, draws, on, behavioral, ecology, artificial, intelligence, genetics, ethology, anthropology, archaeology, biology, ecopsycology, and, zoology, it, is, closely, linked, to, sociobiology, but, there, are, key, differences, between, them, including, the, emphasis, on, domain, specific, rather, than, domain, general, mechanisms, the, relevance, of, measures, of, current, fitness, the, importance, of, mismatch, theory, and, psychology, rather, than, behavior, nikolaas, tinbergen, s, four, categories, of, questions, can, help, to, clarify, the, distinctions, between, several, different, but, complementary, types, of, explanations, evolutionary, psychology, focuses, primarily, on, the, why, questions, while, traditional, psychology, focuses, on, the, how, questions, evolutionary, psychology, is, founded, on, several, core, premises, evolutionary, psychology, has, its, historical, roots, in, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, natural, selection, in, the, origin, of, species, darwin, predicted, that, psychology, would, develop, an, evolutionary, basis, in, the, distant, future, i, see, open, fields, for, far, more, important, researches, psychology, will, be, based, on, a, new, foundation, that, of, the, necessary, acquirement, of, each, mental, power, and, capacity, by, gradation, two, of, his, later, books, were, devoted, to, the, study, of, animal, emotions, and, psychology, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, in, 1871, and, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, in, 1872, darwin, s, work, inspired, william, james, s, functionalist, approach, to, psychology, darwin, s, theories, of, evolution, adaptation, and, natural, selection, have, provided, insight, into, why, brains, function, the, way, they, do, the, content, of, evolutionary, psychology, has, derived, from, on, the, one, hand, the, biological, sciences, especially, evolutionary, theory, as, it, relates, to, ancient, human, environments, the, study, of, paleoanthropology, and, animal, behavior, and, on, the, other, the, human, sciences, especially, psychology, evolutionary, biology, as, an, academic, discipline, emerged, with, the, modern, synthesis, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, in, the, 1930s, the, study, of, animal, behavior, ethology, emerged, with, the, work, of, the, dutch, biologist, nikolaas, tinbergen, and, the, austrian, biologists, konrad, lorenz, and, karl, von, frisch, w, d, hamilton, s, 1964, papers, on, inclusive, fitness, and, robert, trivers, s, 1972, theories, on, reciprocity, and, parental, investment, helped, to, establish, evolutionary, thinking, in, psychology, and, the, other, social, sciences, in, 1975, edward, o, wilson, combined, evolutionary, theory, with, studies, of, animal, and, social, behavior, building, on, the, works, of, lorenz, and, tinbergen, in, his, book, sociobiology, the, new, synthesis, in, the, 1970s, two, major, branches, developed, from, ethology, firstly, the, study, of, animal, social, behavior, including, humans, generated, sociobiology, defined, by, its, pre, eminent, proponent, edward, o, wilson, in, 1975, as, the, systematic, study, of, the, biological, basis, of, all, social, behavior, and, in, 1978, as, the, extension, of, population, biology, and, evolutionary, theory, to, social, organization, secondly, there, was, behavioral, ecology, which, placed, less, emphasis, on, social, behavior, it, focused, on, the, ecological, and, evolutionary, basis, of, animal, and, human, behavior, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, university, departments, began, to, include, the, term, evolutionary, biology, in, their, titles, the, modern, era, of, evolutionary, psychology, was, ushered, in, in, particular, by, donald, symons, 1979, book, the, evolution, of, human, sexuality, and, leda, cosmides, and, john, tooby, s, 1992, book, the, adapted, mind, david, buller, observed, that, the, term, evolutionary, psychology, is, sometimes, seen, as, denoting, research, based, on, the, specific, methodological, and, theoretical, commitments, of, certain, researchers, from, the, santa, barbara, school, university, of, california, thus, some, evolutionary, psychologists, prefer, to, term, their, work, human, ecology, human, behavioural, ecology, or, evolutionary, anthropology, instead, from, psychology, there, are, the, primary, streams, of, developmental, social, and, cognitive, psychology, establishing, some, measure, of, the, relative, influence, of, genetics, and, environment, on, behavior, has, been, at, the, core, of, behavioral, genetics, and, its, variants, notably, studies, at, the, molecular, level, that, examine, the, relationship, between, genes, neurotransmitters, and, behavior, dual, inheritance, theory, dit, developed, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, has, a, slightly, different, perspective, by, trying, to, explain, how, human, behavior, is, a, product, of, two, different, and, interacting, evolutionary, processes, genetic, evolution, and, cultural, evolution, dit, is, seen, by, some, as, a, middle, ground, between, views, that, emphasize, human, universals, versus, those, that, emphasize, cultural, variation, the, theories, on, which, evolutionary, psychology, is, based, originated, with, charles, darwin, s, work, including, his, speculations, about, the, evolutionary, origins, of, social, instincts, in, humans, modern, evolutionary, psychology, however, is, possible, only, because, of, advances, in, evolutionary, theory, in, the, 20th, century, evolutionary, psychologists, say, that, natural, selection, has, provided, humans, with, many, psychological, adaptations, in, much, the, same, way, that, it, generated, humans, anatomical, and, physiological, adaptations, as, with, adaptations, in, general, psychological, adaptations, are, said, to, be, specialized, for, the, environment, in, which, an, organism, evolved, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, sexual, selection, provides, organisms, with, adaptations, related, to, mating, for, male, mammals, which, have, a, relatively, high, maximal, potential, reproduction, rate, sexual, selection, leads, to, adaptations, that, help, them, compete, for, females, for, female, mammals, with, a, relatively, low, maximal, potential, reproduction, rate, sexual, selection, leads, to, choosiness, which, helps, females, select, higher, quality, mates, charles, darwin, described, both, natural, selection, and, sexual, selection, and, he, relied, on, group, selection, to, explain, the, evolution, of, altruistic, self, sacrificing, behavior, but, group, selection, was, considered, a, weak, explanation, because, in, any, group, the, less, altruistic, individuals, will, be, more, likely, to, survive, and, the, group, will, become, less, self, sacrificing, as, a, whole, in, 1964, the, evolutionary, biologist, william, d, hamilton, proposed, inclusive, fitness, theory, emphasizing, a, gene, centered, view, of, evolution, hamilton, noted, that, genes, can, increase, the, replication, of, copies, of, themselves, into, the, next, generation, by, influencing, the, organism, s, social, traits, in, such, a, way, that, statistically, results, in, helping, the, survival, and, reproduction, of, other, copies, of, the, same, genes, most, simply, identical, copies, in, the, organism, s, close, relatives, according, to, hamilton, s, rule, self, sacrificing, behaviors, and, the, genes, influencing, them, can, evolve, if, they, typically, help, the, organism, s, close, relatives, so, much, that, it, more, than, compensates, for, the, individual, animal, s, sacrifice, inclusive, fitness, theory, resolved, the, issue, of, how, altruism, can, evolve, other, theories, also, help, explain, the, evolution, of, altruistic, behavior, including, evolutionary, game, theory, tit, for, tat, reciprocity, and, generalized, reciprocity, these, theories, help, to, explain, the, development, of, altruistic, behavior, and, account, for, hostility, toward, cheaters, individuals, that, take, advantage, of, others, altruism, several, mid, level, evolutionary, theories, inform, evolutionary, psychology, the, r, k, selection, theory, proposes, that, some, species, prosper, by, having, many, offspring, while, others, follow, the, strategy, of, having, fewer, offspring, but, investing, much, more, in, each, one, humans, follow, the, second, strategy, parental, investment, theory, explains, how, parents, invest, more, or, less, in, individual, offspring, based, on, how, successful, those, offspring, are, likely, to, be, and, thus, how, much, they, might, improve, the, parents, inclusive, fitness, according, to, the, trivers, willard, hypothesis, parents, in, good, conditions, tend, to, invest, more, in, sons, who, are, best, able, to, take, advantage, of, good, conditions, while, parents, in, poor, conditions, tend, to, invest, more, in, daughters, who, are, best, able, to, have, successful, offspring, even, in, poor, conditions, according, to, life, history, theory, animals, evolve, life, histories, to, match, their, environments, determining, details, such, as, age, at, first, reproduction, and, number, of, offspring, dual, inheritance, theory, posits, that, genes, and, human, culture, have, interacted, with, genes, affecting, the, development, of, culture, and, culture, in, turn, affecting, human, evolution, on, a, genetic, level, in, a, similar, way, to, the, baldwin, effect, evolutionary, psychology, is, based, on, the, hypothesis, that, just, like, hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, and, immune, systems, cognition, has, a, functional, structure, that, has, a, genetic, basis, and, therefore, has, evolved, by, natural, selection, like, other, organs, and, tissues, this, functional, structure, should, be, universally, shared, amongst, a, species, and, should, solve, important, problems, of, survival, and, reproduction, evolutionary, psychologists, seek, to, understand, psychological, mechanisms, by, understanding, the, survival, and, reproductive, functions, they, might, have, served, over, the, course, of, evolutionary, history, these, might, include, abilities, to, infer, others, emotions, discern, kin, from, non, kin, identify, and, prefer, healthier, mates, cooperate, with, others, and, follow, leaders, consistent, with, the, theory, of, natural, selection, evolutionary, psychology, sees, humans, as, often, in, conflict, with, others, including, mates, and, relatives, for, instance, a, mother, may, wish, to, wean, her, offspring, from, breastfeeding, earlier, than, does, her, infant, which, frees, up, the, mother, to, invest, in, additional, offspring, evolutionary, psychology, also, recognizes, the, role, of, kin, selection, and, reciprocity, in, evolving, prosocial, traits, such, as, altruism, like, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, humans, have, subtle, and, flexible, social, instincts, allowing, them, to, form, extended, families, lifelong, friendships, and, political, alliances, in, studies, testing, theoretical, predictions, evolutionary, psychologists, have, made, modest, findings, on, topics, such, as, infanticide, intelligence, marriage, patterns, promiscuity, perception, of, beauty, bride, price, and, parental, investment, another, example, would, be, the, evolved, mechanism, in, depression, clinical, depression, is, maladaptive, and, should, have, evolutionary, approaches, so, it, can, become, adaptive, over, the, centuries, animals, and, humans, have, gone, through, hard, times, to, stay, alive, which, made, our, fight, or, flight, senses, evolve, tremendously, for, instances, mammalians, have, separation, anxiety, from, their, guardians, which, causes, distress, and, sends, signals, to, their, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, and, emotional, behavioral, changes, going, through, these, types, of, circumstances, helps, mammals, cope, with, separation, anxiety, proponents, of, evolutionary, psychology, in, the, 1990s, made, some, explorations, in, historical, events, but, the, response, from, historical, experts, was, highly, negative, and, there, has, been, little, effort, to, continue, that, line, of, research, historian, lynn, hunt, says, that, the, historians, complained, that, the, researchers, have, read, the, wrong, studies, misinterpreted, the, results, of, experiments, or, worse, yet, turned, to, neuroscience, looking, for, a, universalizing, anti, representational, and, anti, intentional, ontology, to, bolster, their, claims, hunt, states, that, the, few, attempts, to, build, up, a, subfield, of, psychohistory, collapsed, under, the, weight, of, its, presuppositions, she, concludes, that, as, of, 2014, the, iron, curtain, between, historians, and, psychology, remains, standing, not, all, traits, of, organisms, are, evolutionary, adaptations, as, noted, in, the, table, below, traits, may, also, be, exaptations, byproducts, of, adaptations, sometimes, called, spandrels, or, random, variation, between, individuals, psychological, adaptations, are, hypothesized, to, be, innate, or, relatively, easy, to, learn, and, to, manifest, in, cultures, worldwide, for, example, the, ability, of, toddlers, to, learn, a, language, with, virtually, no, training, is, likely, to, be, a, psychological, adaptation, on, the, other, hand, ancestral, humans, did, not, read, or, write, thus, today, learning, to, read, and, write, requires, extensive, training, and, presumably, involves, the, repurposing, of, cognitive, capacities, that, evolved, in, response, to, selection, pressures, unrelated, to, written, language, however, variations, in, manifest, behavior, can, result, from, universal, mechanisms, interacting, with, different, local, environments, for, example, caucasians, who, move, from, a, northern, climate, to, the, equator, will, have, darker, skin, the, mechanisms, regulating, their, pigmentation, do, not, change, rather, the, input, to, those, mechanisms, change, resulting, in, different, outputs, one, of, the, tasks, of, evolutionary, psychology, is, to, identify, which, psychological, traits, are, likely, to, be, adaptations, byproducts, or, random, variation, george, c, williams, suggested, that, an, adaptation, is, a, special, and, onerous, concept, that, should, only, be, used, where, it, is, really, necessary, as, noted, by, williams, and, others, adaptations, can, be, identified, by, their, improbable, complexity, species, universality, and, adaptive, functionality, a, question, that, may, be, asked, about, an, adaptation, is, whether, it, is, generally, obligate, relatively, robust, in, the, face, of, typical, environmental, variation, or, facultative, sensitive, to, typical, environmental, variation, the, sweet, taste, of, sugar, and, the, pain, of, hitting, one, s, knee, against, concrete, are, the, result, of, fairly, obligate, psychological, adaptations, typical, environmental, variability, during, development, does, not, much, affect, their, operation, by, contrast, facultative, adaptations, are, somewhat, like, if, then, statements, for, example, adult, attachment, style, seems, particularly, sensitive, to, early, childhood, experiences, as, adults, the, propensity, to, develop, close, trusting, bonds, with, others, is, dependent, on, whether, early, childhood, caregivers, could, be, trusted, to, provide, reliable, assistance, and, attention, the, adaptation, for, skin, to, tan, is, conditional, to, exposure, to, sunlight, this, is, an, example, of, another, facultative, adaptation, when, a, psychological, adaptation, is, facultative, evolutionary, psychologists, concern, themselves, with, how, developmental, and, environmental, inputs, influence, the, expression, of, the, adaptation, evolutionary, psychologists, hold, that, behaviors, or, traits, that, occur, universally, in, all, cultures, are, good, candidates, for, evolutionary, adaptations, cultural, universals, include, behaviors, related, to, language, cognition, social, roles, gender, roles, and, technology, evolved, psychological, adaptations, such, as, the, ability, to, learn, a, language, interact, with, cultural, inputs, to, produce, specific, behaviors, e, g, the, specific, language, learned, basic, gender, differences, such, as, greater, eagerness, for, sex, among, men, and, greater, coyness, among, women, are, explained, as, sexually, dimorphic, psychological, adaptations, that, reflect, the, different, reproductive, strategies, of, males, and, females, evolutionary, psychologists, contrast, their, approach, to, what, they, term, the, standard, social, science, model, according, to, which, the, mind, is, a, general, purpose, cognition, device, shaped, almost, entirely, by, culture, evolutionary, psychology, argues, that, to, properly, understand, the, functions, of, the, brain, one, must, understand, the, properties, of, the, environment, in, which, the, brain, evolved, that, environment, is, often, referred, to, as, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, the, idea, of, an, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, was, first, explored, as, a, part, of, attachment, theory, by, john, bowlby, this, is, the, environment, to, which, a, particular, evolved, mechanism, is, adapted, more, specifically, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, is, defined, as, the, set, of, historically, recurring, selection, pressures, that, formed, a, given, adaptation, as, well, as, those, aspects, of, the, environment, that, were, necessary, for, the, proper, development, and, functioning, of, the, adaptation, humans, the, genus, homo, appeared, between, 1, 5, and, 2, 5, million, years, ago, a, time, that, roughly, coincides, with, the, start, of, the, pleistocene, 2, 6, million, years, ago, because, the, pleistocene, ended, a, mere, 12, 000, years, ago, most, human, adaptations, either, newly, evolved, during, the, pleistocene, or, were, maintained, by, stabilizing, selection, during, the, pleistocene, evolutionary, psychology, therefore, proposes, that, the, majority, of, human, psychological, mechanisms, are, adapted, to, reproductive, problems, frequently, encountered, in, pleistocene, environments, in, broad, terms, these, problems, include, those, of, growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and, social, relationships, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, is, significantly, different, from, modern, society, the, ancestors, of, modern, humans, lived, in, smaller, groups, had, more, cohesive, cultures, and, had, more, stable, and, rich, contexts, for, identity, and, meaning, researchers, look, to, existing, hunter, gatherer, societies, for, clues, as, to, how, hunter, gatherers, lived, in, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, unfortunately, the, few, surviving, hunter, gatherer, societies, are, different, from, each, other, and, they, have, been, pushed, out, of, the, best, land, and, into, harsh, environments, so, it, is, not, clear, how, closely, they, reflect, ancestral, culture, however, all, around, the, world, small, band, hunter, gatherers, offer, a, similar, developmental, system, for, the, young, hunter, gatherer, childhood, model, konner, 2005, evolved, developmental, niche, or, evolved, nest, narvaez, et, al, 2013, the, characteristics, of, the, niche, are, largely, the, same, as, for, social, mammals, who, evolved, over, 30, million, years, ago, soothing, perinatal, experience, several, years, of, on, request, breastfeeding, nearly, constant, affection, or, physical, proximity, responsiveness, to, need, mitigating, offspring, distress, self, directed, play, and, for, humans, multiple, responsive, caregivers, initial, studies, show, the, importance, of, these, components, in, early, life, for, positive, child, outcomes, evolutionary, psychologists, sometimes, look, to, chimpanzees, bonobos, and, other, great, apes, for, insight, into, human, ancestral, behavior, since, an, organism, s, adaptations, were, suited, to, its, ancestral, environment, a, new, and, different, environment, can, create, a, mismatch, because, humans, are, mostly, adapted, to, pleistocene, environments, psychological, mechanisms, sometimes, exhibit, mismatches, to, the, modern, environment, one, example, is, the, fact, that, although, about, 10, 000, people, are, killed, with, guns, in, the, us, annually, whereas, spiders, and, snakes, kill, only, a, handful, people, nonetheless, learn, to, fear, spiders, and, snakes, about, as, easily, as, they, do, a, pointed, gun, and, more, easily, than, an, unpointed, gun, rabbits, or, flowers, a, potential, explanation, is, that, spiders, and, snakes, were, a, threat, to, human, ancestors, throughout, the, pleistocene, whereas, guns, and, rabbits, and, flowers, were, not, there, is, thus, a, mismatch, between, humans, evolved, fear, learning, psychology, and, the, modern, environment, this, mismatch, also, shows, up, in, the, phenomena, of, the, supernormal, stimulus, a, stimulus, that, elicits, a, response, more, strongly, than, the, stimulus, for, which, the, response, evolved, the, term, was, coined, by, niko, tinbergen, to, refer, to, non, human, animal, behavior, but, psychologist, deirdre, barrett, said, that, supernormal, stimulation, governs, the, behavior, of, humans, as, powerfully, as, that, of, other, animals, she, explained, junk, food, as, an, exaggerated, stimulus, to, cravings, for, salt, sugar, and, fats, and, she, says, that, television, is, an, exaggeration, of, social, cues, of, laughter, smiling, faces, and, attention, grabbing, action, magazine, centerfolds, and, double, cheeseburgers, pull, instincts, intended, for, an, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, where, breast, development, was, a, sign, of, health, youth, and, fertility, in, a, prospective, mate, and, fat, was, a, rare, and, vital, nutrient, the, psychologist, mark, van, vugt, recently, argued, that, modern, organizational, leadership, is, a, mismatch, his, argument, is, that, humans, are, not, adapted, to, work, in, large, anonymous, bureaucratic, structures, with, formal, hierarchies, the, human, mind, still, responds, to, personalized, charismatic, leadership, primarily, in, the, context, of, informal, egalitarian, settings, hence, the, dissatisfaction, and, alienation, that, many, employees, experience, salaries, bonuses, and, other, privileges, exploit, instincts, for, relative, status, which, attract, particularly, males, to, senior, executive, positions, evolutionary, theory, is, heuristic, in, that, it, may, generate, hypotheses, that, might, not, be, developed, from, other, theoretical, approaches, one, of, the, major, goals, of, adaptationist, research, is, to, identify, which, organismic, traits, are, likely, to, be, adaptations, and, which, are, byproducts, or, random, variations, as, noted, earlier, adaptations, are, expected, to, show, evidence, of, complexity, functionality, and, species, universality, while, byproducts, or, random, variation, will, not, in, addition, adaptations, are, expected, to, manifest, as, proximate, mechanisms, that, interact, with, the, environment, in, either, a, generally, obligate, or, facultative, fashion, see, above, evolutionary, psychologists, are, also, interested, in, identifying, these, proximate, mechanisms, sometimes, termed, mental, mechanisms, or, psychological, adaptations, and, what, type, of, information, they, take, as, input, how, they, process, that, information, and, their, outputs, evolutionary, developmental, psychology, or, evo, devo, focuses, on, how, adaptations, may, be, activated, at, certain, developmental, times, e, g, losing, baby, teeth, adolescence, etc, or, how, events, during, the, development, of, an, individual, may, alter, life, history, trajectories, evolutionary, psychologists, use, several, strategies, to, develop, and, test, hypotheses, about, whether, a, psychological, trait, is, likely, to, be, an, evolved, adaptation, buss, 2011, notes, that, these, methods, include, cross, cultural, consistency, characteristics, that, have, been, demonstrated, to, be, cross, cultural, human, universals, such, as, smiling, crying, facial, expressions, are, presumed, to, be, evolved, psychological, adaptations, several, evolutionary, psychologists, have, collected, massive, datasets, from, cultures, around, the, world, to, assess, cross, cultural, universality, function, to, form, or, problem, to, solution, the, fact, that, males, but, not, females, risk, potential, misidentification, of, genetic, offspring, referred, to, as, paternity, uncertainty, led, evolutionary, psychologists, to, hypothesize, that, compared, to, females, male, jealousy, would, be, more, focused, on, sexual, rather, than, emotional, infidelity, form, to, function, reverse, engineering, or, solution, to, problem, morning, sickness, and, associated, aversions, to, certain, types, of, food, during, pregnancy, seemed, to, have, the, characteristics, of, an, evolved, adaptation, complexity, and, universality, margie, profet, hypothesized, that, the, function, was, to, avoid, the, ingestion, of, toxins, during, early, pregnancy, that, could, damage, fetus, but, which, are, otherwise, likely, to, be, harmless, to, healthy, non, pregnant, women, corresponding, neurological, modules, evolutionary, psychology, and, cognitive, neuropsychology, are, mutually, compatible, evolutionary, psychology, helps, to, identify, psychological, adaptations, and, their, ultimate, evolutionary, functions, while, neuropsychology, helps, to, identify, the, proximate, manifestations, of, these, adaptations, current, evolutionary, adaptiveness, in, addition, to, evolutionary, models, that, suggest, evolution, occurs, across, large, spans, of, time, recent, research, has, demonstrated, that, some, evolutionary, shifts, can, be, fast, and, dramatic, consequently, some, evolutionary, psychologists, have, focused, on, the, impact, of, psychological, traits, in, the, current, environment, such, research, can, be, used, to, inform, estimates, of, the, prevalence, of, traits, over, time, such, work, has, been, informative, in, studying, evolutionary, psychopathology, evolutionary, psychologists, also, use, various, sources, of, data, for, testing, including, experiments, archaeological, records, data, from, hunter, gatherer, societies, observational, studies, neuroscience, data, self, reports, and, surveys, public, records, and, human, products, recently, additional, methods, and, tools, have, been, introduced, based, on, fictional, scenarios, mathematical, models, and, multi, agent, computer, simulations, foundational, areas, of, research, in, evolutionary, psychology, can, be, divided, into, broad, categories, of, adaptive, problems, that, arise, from, evolutionary, theory, itself, survival, mating, parenting, family, and, kinship, interactions, with, non, kin, and, cultural, evolution, problems, of, survival, are, clear, targets, for, the, evolution, of, physical, and, psychological, adaptations, major, problems, the, ancestors, of, present, day, humans, faced, included, food, selection, and, acquisition, territory, selection, and, physical, shelter, and, avoiding, predators, and, other, environmental, threats, consciousness, meets, george, williams, criteria, of, species, universality, complexity, and, functionality, and, it, is, a, trait, that, apparently, increases, fitness, in, his, paper, evolution, of, consciousness, john, eccles, argues, that, special, anatomical, and, physical, adaptations, of, the, mammalian, cerebral, cortex, gave, rise, to, consciousness, in, contrast, others, have, argued, that, the, recursive, circuitry, underwriting, consciousness, is, much, more, primitive, having, evolved, initially, in, pre, mammalian, species, because, it, improves, the, capacity, for, interaction, with, both, social, and, natural, environments, by, providing, an, energy, saving, neutral, gear, in, an, otherwise, energy, expensive, motor, output, machine, once, in, place, this, recursive, circuitry, may, well, have, provided, a, basis, for, the, subsequent, development, of, many, of, the, functions, that, consciousness, facilitates, in, higher, organisms, as, outlined, by, bernard, j, baars, richard, dawkins, suggested, that, humans, evolved, consciousness, in, order, to, make, themselves, the, subjects, of, thought, daniel, povinelli, suggests, that, large, tree, climbing, apes, evolved, consciousness, to, take, into, account, one, s, own, mass, when, moving, safely, among, tree, branches, consistent, with, this, hypothesis, gordon, gallup, found, that, chimpanzees, and, orangutans, but, not, little, monkeys, or, terrestrial, gorillas, demonstrated, self, awareness, in, mirror, tests, the, concept, of, consciousness, can, refer, to, voluntary, action, awareness, or, wakefulness, however, even, voluntary, behavior, involves, unconscious, mechanisms, many, cognitive, processes, take, place, in, the, cognitive, unconscious, unavailable, to, conscious, awareness, some, behaviors, are, conscious, when, learned, but, then, become, unconscious, seemingly, automatic, learning, especially, implicitly, learning, a, skill, can, take, place, seemingly, outside, of, consciousness, for, example, plenty, of, people, know, how, to, turn, right, when, they, ride, a, bike, but, very, few, can, accurately, explain, how, they, actually, do, so, evolutionary, psychology, approaches, self, deception, as, an, adaptation, that, can, improve, one, s, results, in, social, exchanges, sleep, may, have, evolved, to, conserve, energy, when, activity, would, be, less, fruitful, or, more, dangerous, such, as, at, night, and, especially, during, the, winter, season, many, experts, such, as, jerry, fodor, write, that, the, purpose, of, perception, is, knowledge, but, evolutionary, psychologists, hold, that, its, primary, purpose, is, to, guide, action, for, example, they, say, depth, perception, seems, to, have, evolved, not, to, help, us, know, the, distances, to, other, objects, but, rather, to, help, us, move, around, in, space, evolutionary, psychologists, say, that, animals, from, fiddler, crabs, to, humans, use, eyesight, for, collision, avoidance, suggesting, that, vision, is, basically, for, directing, action, not, providing, knowledge, building, and, maintaining, sense, organs, is, metabolically, expensive, so, these, organs, evolve, only, when, they, improve, an, organism, s, fitness, more, than, half, the, brain, is, devoted, to, processing, sensory, information, and, the, brain, itself, consumes, roughly, one, fourth, of, one, s, metabolic, resources, so, the, senses, must, provide, exceptional, benefits, to, fitness, perception, accurately, mirrors, the, world, animals, get, useful, accurate, information, through, their, senses, scientists, who, study, perception, and, sensation, have, long, understood, the, human, senses, as, adaptations, to, their, surrounding, worlds, depth, perception, consists, of, processing, over, half, a, dozen, visual, cues, each, of, which, is, based, on, a, regularity, of, the, physical, world, vision, evolved, to, respond, to, the, narrow, range, of, electromagnetic, energy, that, is, plentiful, and, that, does, not, pass, through, objects, sound, waves, go, around, corners, and, interact, with, obstacles, creating, a, complex, pattern, that, includes, useful, information, about, the, sources, of, and, distances, to, objects, larger, animals, naturally, make, lower, pitched, sounds, as, a, consequence, of, their, size, the, range, over, which, an, animal, hears, on, the, other, hand, is, determined, by, adaptation, homing, pigeons, for, example, can, hear, the, very, low, pitched, sound, infrasound, that, carries, great, distances, even, though, most, smaller, animals, detect, higher, pitched, sounds, taste, and, smell, respond, to, chemicals, in, the, environment, that, are, thought, to, have, been, significant, for, fitness, in, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, for, example, salt, and, sugar, were, apparently, both, valuable, to, the, human, or, pre, human, inhabitants, of, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, so, present, day, humans, have, an, intrinsic, hunger, for, salty, and, sweet, tastes, the, sense, of, touch, is, actually, many, senses, including, pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and, pain, pain, while, unpleasant, is, adaptive, an, important, adaptation, for, senses, is, range, shifting, by, which, the, organism, becomes, temporarily, more, or, less, sensitive, to, sensation, for, example, one, s, eyes, automatically, adjust, to, dim, or, bright, ambient, light, sensory, abilities, of, different, organisms, often, coevolve, as, is, the, case, with, the, hearing, of, echolocating, bats, and, that, of, the, moths, that, have, evolved, to, respond, to, the, sounds, that, the, bats, make, evolutionary, psychologists, contend, that, perception, demonstrates, the, principle, of, modularity, with, specialized, mechanisms, handling, particular, perception, tasks, for, example, people, with, damage, to, a, particular, part, of, the, brain, have, the, specific, defect, of, not, being, able, to, recognize, faces, prosopagnosia, evolutionary, psychology, suggests, that, this, indicates, a, so, called, face, reading, module, in, evolutionary, psychology, learning, is, said, to, be, accomplished, through, evolved, capacities, specifically, facultative, adaptations, facultative, adaptations, express, themselves, differently, depending, on, input, from, the, environment, sometimes, the, input, comes, during, development, and, helps, shape, that, development, for, example, migrating, birds, learn, to, orient, themselves, by, the, stars, during, a, critical, period, in, their, maturation, evolutionary, psychologists, believe, that, humans, also, learn, language, along, an, evolved, program, also, with, critical, periods, the, input, can, also, come, during, daily, tasks, helping, the, organism, cope, with, changing, environmental, conditions, for, example, animals, evolved, pavlovian, conditioning, in, order, to, solve, problems, about, causal, relationships, animals, accomplish, learning, tasks, most, easily, when, those, tasks, resemble, problems, that, they, faced, in, their, evolutionary, past, such, as, a, rat, learning, where, to, find, food, or, water, learning, capacities, sometimes, demonstrate, differences, between, the, sexes, in, many, animal, species, for, example, males, can, solve, spatial, problems, faster, and, more, accurately, than, females, due, to, the, effects, of, male, hormones, during, development, the, same, might, be, true, of, humans, motivations, direct, and, energize, behavior, while, emotions, provide, the, affective, component, to, motivation, positive, or, negative, in, the, early, 1970s, paul, ekman, and, colleagues, began, a, line, of, research, which, suggests, that, many, emotions, are, universal, he, found, evidence, that, humans, share, at, least, five, basic, emotions, fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and, disgust, social, emotions, evidently, evolved, to, motivate, social, behaviors, that, were, adaptive, in, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptedness, for, example, spite, seems, to, work, against, the, individual, but, it, can, establish, an, individual, s, reputation, as, someone, to, be, feared, shame, and, pride, can, motivate, behaviors, that, help, one, maintain, one, s, standing, in, a, community, and, self, esteem, is, one, s, estimate, of, one, s, status, motivation, has, a, neurobiological, basis, in, the, reward, system, of, the, brain, recently, it, has, been, suggested, that, reward, systems, may, evolve, in, such, a, way, that, there, may, be, an, inherent, or, unavoidable, trade, off, in, the, motivational, system, for, activities, of, short, versus, long, duration, cognition, refers, to, internal, representations, of, the, world, and, internal, information, processing, from, an, evolutionary, psychology, perspective, cognition, is, not, general, purpose, but, uses, heuristics, or, strategies, that, generally, increase, the, likelihood, of, solving, problems, that, the, ancestors, of, present, day, humans, routinely, faced, for, example, present, day, humans, are, far, more, likely, to, solve, logic, problems, that, involve, detecting, cheating, a, common, problem, given, humans, social, nature, than, the, same, logic, problem, put, in, purely, abstract, terms, since, the, ancestors, of, present, day, humans, did, not, encounter, truly, random, events, present, day, humans, may, be, cognitively, predisposed, to, incorrectly, identify, patterns, in, random, sequences, gamblers, fallacy, is, one, example, of, this, gamblers, may, falsely, believe, that, they, have, hit, a, lucky, streak, even, when, each, outcome, is, actually, random, and, independent, of, previous, trials, most, people, believe, that, if, a, fair, coin, has, been, flipped, 9, times, and, heads, appears, each, time, that, on, the, tenth, flip, there, is, a, greater, than, 50, chance, of, getting, tails, humans, find, it, far, easier, to, make, diagnoses, or, predictions, using, frequency, data, than, when, the, same, information, is, presented, as, probabilities, or, percentages, presumably, because, the, ancestors, of, present, day, humans, lived, in, relatively, small, tribes, usually, with, fewer, than, 150, people, where, frequency, information, was, more, readily, available, evolutionary, psychology, is, primarily, interested, in, finding, commonalities, between, people, or, basic, human, psychological, nature, from, an, evolutionary, perspective, the, fact, that, people, have, fundamental, differences, in, personality, traits, initially, presents, something, of, a, puzzle, note, the, field, of, behavioral, genetics, is, concerned, with, statistically, partitioning, differences, between, people, into, genetic, and, environmental, sources, of, variance, however, understanding, the, concept, of, heritability, can, be, tricky, heritability, refers, only, to, the, differences, between, people, never, the, degree, to, which, the, traits, of, an, individual, are, due, to, environmental, or, genetic, factors, since, traits, are, always, a, complex, interweaving, of, both, personality, traits, are, conceptualized, by, evolutionary, psychologists, as, due, to, normal, variation, around, an, optimum, due, to, frequency, dependent, selection, behavioral, polymorphisms, or, as, facultative, adaptations, like, variability, in, height, some, personality, traits, may, simply, reflect, inter, individual, variability, around, a, general, optimum, or, personality, traits, may, represent, different, genetically, predisposed, behavioral, morphs, alternate, behavioral, strategies, that, depend, on, the, frequency, of, competing, behavioral, strategies, in, the, population, for, example, if, most, of, the, population, is, generally, trusting, and, gullible, the, behavioral, morph, of, being, a, cheater, or, in, the, extreme, case, a, sociopath, may, be, advantageous, finally, like, many, other, psychological, adaptations, personality, traits, may, be, facultative, sensitive, to, typical, variations, in, the, social, environment, especially, during, early, development, for, example, later, born, children, are, more, likely, than, firstborns, to, be, rebellious, less, conscientious, and, more, open, to, new, experiences, which, may, be, advantageous, to, them, given, their, particular, niche, in, family, structure, shared, environmental, influences, do, play, a, role, in, personality, and, are, not, always, of, less, importance, than, genetic, factors, however, shared, environmental, influences, often, decrease, to, near, zero, after, adolescence, but, do, not, completely, disappear, according, to, steven, pinker, who, builds, on, the, work, by, noam, chomsky, the, universal, human, ability, to, learn, to, talk, between, the, ages, of, 1, 4, basically, without, training, suggests, that, language, acquisition, is, a, distinctly, human, psychological, adaptation, see, in, particular, pinker, s, the, language, instinct, pinker, and, bloom, 1990, argue, that, language, as, a, mental, faculty, shares, many, likenesses, with, the, complex, organs, of, the, body, which, suggests, that, like, these, organs, language, has, evolved, as, an, adaptation, since, this, is, the, only, known, mechanism, by, which, such, complex, organs, can, develop, pinker, follows, chomsky, in, arguing, that, the, fact, that, children, can, learn, any, human, language, with, no, explicit, instruction, suggests, that, language, including, most, of, grammar, is, basically, innate, and, that, it, only, needs, to, be, activated, by, interaction, chomsky, himself, does, not, believe, language, to, have, evolved, as, an, adaptation, but, suggests, that, it, likely, evolved, as, a, byproduct, of, some, other, adaptation, a, so, called, spandrel, but, pinker, and, bloom, argue, that, the, organic, nature, of, language, strongly, suggests, that, it, has, an, adaptational, origin, evolutionary, psychologists, hold, that, the, foxp2, gene, may, well, be, associated, with, the, evolution, of, human, language, in, the, 1980s, psycholinguist, myrna, gopnik, identified, a, dominant, gene, that, causes, language, impairment, in, the, ke, family, of, britain, this, gene, turned, out, to, be, a, mutation, of, the, foxp2, gene, humans, have, a, unique, allele, of, this, gene, which, has, otherwise, been, closely, conserved, through, most, of, mammalian, evolutionary, history, this, unique, allele, seems, to, have, first, appeared, between, 100, and, 200, thousand, years, ago, and, it, is, now, all, but, universal, in, humans, however, the, once, popular, idea, that, foxp2, is, a, grammar, gene, or, that, it, triggered, the, emergence, of, language, in, homo, sapiens, is, now, widely, discredited, currently, several, competing, theories, about, the, evolutionary, origin, of, language, coexist, none, of, them, having, achieved, a, general, consensus, researchers, of, language, acquisition, in, primates, and, humans, such, as, michael, tomasello, and, talmy, giv, n, argue, that, the, innatist, framework, has, understated, the, role, of, imitation, in, learning, and, that, it, is, not, at, all, necessary, to, posit, the, existence, of, an, innate, grammar, module, to, explain, human, language, acquisition, tomasello, argues, that, studies, of, how, children, and, primates, actually, acquire, communicative, skills, suggest, that, humans, learn, complex, behavior, through, experience, so, that, instead, of, a, module, specifically, dedicated, to, language, acquisition, language, is, acquired, by, the, same, cognitive, mechanisms, that, are, used, to, acquire, all, other, kinds, of, socially, transmitted, behavior, on, the, issue, of, whether, language, is, best, seen, as, having, evolved, as, an, adaptation, or, as, a, spandrel, evolutionary, biologist, w, tecumseh, fitch, following, stephen, j, gould, argues, that, it, is, unwarranted, to, assume, that, every, aspect, of, language, is, an, adaptation, or, that, language, as, a, whole, is, an, adaptation, he, criticizes, some, strands, of, evolutionary, psychology, for, suggesting, a, pan, adaptionist, view, of, evolution, and, dismisses, pinker, and, bloom, s, question, of, whether, language, has, evolved, as, an, adaptation, as, being, misleading, he, argues, instead, that, from, a, biological, viewpoint, the, evolutionary, origins, of, language, is, best, conceptualized, as, being, the, probable, result, of, a, convergence, of, many, separate, adaptations, into, a, complex, system, a, similar, argument, is, made, by, terrence, deacon, who, in, the, symbolic, species, argues, that, the, different, features, of, language, have, co, evolved, with, the, evolution, of, the, mind, and, that, the, ability, to, use, symbolic, communication, is, integrated, in, all, other, cognitive, processes, if, the, theory, that, language, could, have, evolved, as, a, single, adaptation, is, accepted, the, question, becomes, which, of, its, many, functions, has, been, the, basis, of, adaptation, several, evolutionary, hypotheses, have, been, posited, that, language, evolved, for, the, purpose, of, social, grooming, that, it, evolved, as, a, way, to, show, mating, potential, or, that, it, evolved, to, form, social, contracts, evolutionary, psychologists, recognize, that, these, theories, are, all, speculative, and, that, much, more, evidence, is, required, to, understand, how, language, might, have, been, selectively, adapted, given, that, sexual, reproduction, is, the, means, by, which, genes, are, propagated, into, future, generations, sexual, selection, plays, a, large, role, in, human, evolution, human, mating, then, is, of, interest, to, evolutionary, psychologists, who, aim, to, investigate, evolved, mechanisms, to, attract, and, secure, mates, several, lines, of, research, have, stemmed, from, this, interest, such, as, studies, of, mate, selection, mate, poaching, mate, retention, mating, preferences, and, conflict, between, the, sexes, in, 1972, robert, trivers, published, an, influential, paper, on, sex, differences, that, is, now, referred, to, as, parental, investment, theory, the, size, differences, of, gametes, anisogamy, is, the, fundamental, defining, difference, between, males, small, gametes, sperm, and, females, large, gametes, ova, trivers, noted, that, anisogamy, typically, results, in, different, levels, of, parental, investment, between, the, sexes, with, females, initially, investing, more, trivers, proposed, that, this, difference, in, parental, investment, leads, to, the, sexual, selection, of, different, reproductive, strategies, between, the, sexes, and, to, sexual, conflict, for, example, he, suggested, that, the, sex, that, invests, less, in, offspring, will, generally, compete, for, access, to, the, higher, investing, sex, to, increase, their, inclusive, fitness, trivers, posited, that, differential, parental, investment, led, to, the, evolution, of, sexual, dimorphisms, in, mate, choice, intra, and, inter, sexual, reproductive, competition, and, courtship, displays, in, mammals, including, humans, females, make, a, much, larger, parental, investment, than, males, i, e, gestation, followed, by, childbirth, and, lactation, parental, investment, theory, is, a, branch, of, life, history, theory, buss, and, schmitt, s, 1993, sexual, strategies, theory, proposed, that, due, to, differential, parental, investment, humans, have, evolved, sexually, dimorphic, adaptations, related, to, sexual, accessibility, fertility, assessment, commitment, seeking, and, avoidance, immediate, and, enduring, resource, procurement, paternity, certainty, assessment, of, mate, value, and, parental, investment, their, strategic, interference, theory, suggested, that, conflict, between, the, sexes, occurs, when, the, preferred, reproductive, strategies, of, one, sex, interfere, with, those, of, the, other, sex, resulting, in, the, activation, of, emotional, responses, such, as, anger, or, jealousy, women, are, generally, more, selective, when, choosing, mates, especially, under, long, term, mating, conditions, however, under, some, circumstances, short, term, mating, can, provide, benefits, to, women, as, well, such, as, fertility, insurance, trading, up, to, better, genes, reducing, the, risk, of, inbreeding, and, insurance, protection, of, her, offspring, due, to, male, paternity, uncertainty, sex, differences, have, been, found, in, the, domains, of, sexual, jealousy, females, generally, react, more, adversely, to, emotional, infidelity, and, males, will, react, more, to, sexual, infidelity, this, particular, pattern, is, predicted, because, the, costs, involved, in, mating, for, each, sex, are, distinct, women, on, average, should, prefer, a, mate, who, can, offer, resources, e, g, financial, commitment, thus, a, woman, risks, losing, such, resources, with, a, mate, who, commits, emotional, infidelity, men, on, the, other, hand, are, never, certain, of, the, genetic, paternity, of, their, children, because, they, do, not, bear, the, offspring, themselves, this, suggests, that, for, men, sexual, infidelity, would, generally, be, more, aversive, than, emotional, infidelity, because, investing, resources, in, another, man, s, offspring, does, not, lead, to, the, propagation, of, their, own, genes, another, interesting, line, of, research, is, that, which, examines, women, s, mate, preferences, across, the, ovulatory, cycle, the, theoretical, underpinning, of, this, research, is, that, ancestral, women, would, have, evolved, mechanisms, to, select, mates, with, certain, traits, depending, on, their, hormonal, status, known, as, the, ovulatory, shift, hypothesis, the, theory, posits, that, during, the, ovulatory, phase, of, a, woman, s, cycle, approximately, days, 10, 15, of, a, woman, s, cycle, a, woman, who, mated, with, a, male, with, high, genetic, quality, would, have, been, more, likely, on, average, to, produce, and, bear, a, healthy, offspring, than, a, woman, who, mated, with, a, male, with, low, genetic, quality, these, putative, preferences, are, predicted, to, be, especially, apparent, for, short, term, mating, domains, because, a, potential, male, mate, would, only, be, offering, genes, to, a, potential, offspring, this, hypothesis, allows, researchers, to, examine, whether, women, select, mates, who, have, characteristics, that, indicate, high, genetic, quality, during, the, high, fertility, phase, of, their, ovulatory, cycles, indeed, studies, have, shown, that, women, s, preferences, vary, across, the, ovulatory, cycle, in, particular, haselton, and, miller, 2006, showed, that, highly, fertile, women, prefer, creative, but, poor, men, as, short, term, mates, creativity, may, be, a, proxy, for, good, genes, research, by, gangestad, et, al, 2004, indicates, that, highly, fertile, women, prefer, men, who, display, social, presence, and, intrasexual, competition, these, traits, may, act, as, cues, that, would, help, women, predict, which, men, may, have, or, would, be, able, to, acquire, resources, reproduction, is, always, costly, for, women, and, can, also, be, for, men, individuals, are, limited, in, the, degree, to, which, they, can, devote, time, and, resources, to, producing, and, raising, their, young, and, such, expenditure, may, also, be, detrimental, to, their, future, condition, survival, and, further, reproductive, output, parental, investment, is, any, parental, expenditure, time, energy, etc, that, benefits, one, offspring, at, a, cost, to, parents, ability, to, invest, in, other, components, of, fitness, clutton, brock, 1991, 9, trivers, 1972, components, of, fitness, beatty, 1992, include, the, well, being, of, existing, offspring, parents, future, reproduction, and, inclusive, fitness, through, aid, to, kin, hamilton, 1964, parental, investment, theory, is, a, branch, of, life, history, theory, the, benefits, of, parental, investment, to, the, offspring, are, large, and, are, associated, with, the, effects, on, condition, growth, survival, and, ultimately, on, the, reproductive, success, of, the, offspring, however, these, benefits, can, come, at, the, cost, of, the, parent, s, ability, to, reproduce, in, the, future, e, g, through, the, increased, risk, of, injury, when, defending, offspring, against, predators, the, loss, of, mating, opportunities, whilst, rearing, offspring, and, an, increase, in, the, time, to, the, next, reproduction, overall, parents, are, selected, to, maximize, the, difference, between, the, benefits, and, the, costs, and, parental, care, will, likely, evolve, when, the, benefits, exceed, the, costs, the, cinderella, effect, is, an, alleged, high, incidence, of, stepchildren, being, physically, emotionally, or, sexually, abused, neglected, murdered, or, otherwise, mistreated, at, the, hands, of, their, stepparents, at, significantly, higher, rates, than, their, genetic, counterparts, it, takes, its, name, from, the, fairy, tale, character, cinderella, who, in, the, story, was, cruelly, mistreated, by, her, stepmother, and, stepsisters, daly, and, wilson, 1996, noted, evolutionary, thinking, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, most, important, risk, factor, for, child, homicide, the, presence, of, a, stepparent, parental, efforts, and, investments, are, valuable, resources, and, selection, favors, those, parental, psyches, that, allocate, effort, effectively, to, promote, fitness, the, adaptive, problems, that, challenge, parental, decision, making, include, both, the, accurate, identification, of, one, s, offspring, and, the, allocation, of, one, s, resources, among, them, with, sensitivity, to, their, needs, and, abilities, to, convert, parental, investment, into, fitness, increments, stepchildren, were, seldom, or, never, so, valuable, to, one, s, expected, fitness, as, one, s, own, offspring, would, be, and, those, parental, psyches, that, were, easily, parasitized, by, just, any, appealing, youngster, must, always, have, incurred, a, selective, disadvantage, daly, wilson, 1996, pp, 64, 65, however, they, note, that, not, all, stepparents, will, want, to, abuse, their, partner, s, children, or, that, genetic, parenthood, is, any, insurance, against, abuse, they, see, step, parental, care, as, primarily, mating, effort, towards, the, genetic, parent, inclusive, fitness, is, the, sum, of, an, organism, s, classical, fitness, how, many, of, its, own, offspring, it, produces, and, supports, and, the, number, of, equivalents, of, its, own, offspring, it, can, add, to, the, population, by, supporting, others, the, first, component, is, called, classical, fitness, by, hamilton, 1964, from, the, gene, s, point, of, view, evolutionary, success, ultimately, depends, on, leaving, behind, the, maximum, number, of, copies, of, itself, in, the, population, until, 1964, it, was, generally, believed, that, genes, only, achieved, this, by, causing, the, individual, to, leave, the, maximum, number, of, viable, offspring, however, in, 1964, w, d, hamilton, proved, mathematically, that, because, close, relatives, of, an, organism, share, some, identical, genes, a, gene, can, also, increase, its, evolutionary, success, by, promoting, the, reproduction, and, survival, of, these, related, or, otherwise, similar, individuals, hamilton, concluded, that, this, leads, natural, selection, to, favor, organisms, that, would, behave, in, ways, that, maximize, their, inclusive, fitness, it, is, also, true, that, natural, selection, favors, behavior, that, maximizes, personal, fitness, hamilton, s, rule, describes, mathematically, whether, or, not, a, gene, for, altruistic, behavior, will, spread, in, a, population, where, the, concept, serves, to, explain, how, natural, selection, can, perpetuate, altruism, if, there, is, an, altruism, gene, or, complex, of, genes, that, influences, an, organism, s, behavior, to, be, helpful, and, protective, of, relatives, and, their, offspring, this, behavior, also, increases, the, proportion, of, the, altruism, gene, in, the, population, because, relatives, are, likely, to, share, genes, with, the, altruist, due, to, common, descent, altruists, may, also, have, some, way, to, recognize, altruistic, behavior, in, unrelated, individuals, and, be, inclined, to, support, them, as, dawkins, points, out, in, the, selfish, gene, chapter, 6, and, the, extended, phenotype, this, must, be, distinguished, from, the, green, beard, effect, although, it, is, generally, true, that, humans, tend, to, be, more, altruistic, toward, their, kin, than, toward, non, kin, the, relevant, proximate, mechanisms, that, mediate, this, cooperation, have, been, debated, see, kin, recognition, with, some, arguing, that, kin, status, is, determined, primarily, via, social, and, cultural, factors, such, as, co, residence, maternal, association, of, sibs, etc, while, others, have, argued, that, kin, recognition, can, also, be, mediated, by, biological, factors, such, as, facial, resemblance, and, immunogenetic, similarity, of, the, major, histocompatibility, complex, mhc, for, a, discussion, of, the, interaction, of, these, social, and, biological, kin, recognition, factors, see, lieberman, tooby, and, cosmides, 2007, pdf, whatever, the, proximate, mechanisms, of, kin, recognition, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, humans, act, generally, more, altruistically, to, close, genetic, kin, compared, to, genetic, non, kin, although, interactions, with, non, kin, are, generally, less, altruistic, compared, to, those, with, kin, cooperation, can, be, maintained, with, non, kin, via, mutually, beneficial, reciprocity, as, was, proposed, by, robert, trivers, if, there, are, repeated, encounters, between, the, same, two, players, in, an, evolutionary, game, in, which, each, of, them, can, choose, either, to, cooperate, or, defect, then, a, strategy, of, mutual, cooperation, may, be, favored, even, if, it, pays, each, player, in, the, short, term, to, defect, when, the, other, cooperates, direct, reciprocity, can, lead, to, the, evolution, of, cooperation, only, if, the, probability, w, of, another, encounter, between, the, same, two, individuals, exceeds, the, cost, to, benefit, ratio, of, the, altruistic, act, reciprocity, can, also, be, indirect, if, information, about, previous, interactions, is, shared, reputation, allows, evolution, of, cooperation, by, indirect, reciprocity, natural, selection, favors, strategies, that, base, the, decision, to, help, on, the, reputation, of, the, recipient, studies, show, that, people, who, are, more, helpful, are, more, likely, to, receive, help, the, calculations, of, indirect, reciprocity, are, complicated, and, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, this, universe, has, been, uncovered, but, again, a, simple, rule, has, emerged, indirect, reciprocity, can, only, promote, cooperation, if, the, probability, q, of, knowing, someone, s, reputation, exceeds, the, cost, to, benefit, ratio, of, the, altruistic, act, one, important, problem, with, this, explanation, is, that, individuals, may, be, able, to, evolve, the, capacity, to, obscure, their, reputation, reducing, the, probability, q, that, it, will, be, known, trivers, argues, that, friendship, and, various, social, emotions, evolved, in, order, to, manage, reciprocity, liking, and, disliking, he, says, evolved, to, help, present, day, humans, ancestors, form, coalitions, with, others, who, reciprocated, and, to, exclude, those, who, did, not, reciprocate, moral, indignation, may, have, evolved, to, prevent, one, s, altruism, from, being, exploited, by, cheaters, and, gratitude, may, have, motivated, present, day, humans, ancestors, to, reciprocate, appropriately, after, benefiting, from, others, altruism, likewise, present, day, humans, feel, guilty, when, they, fail, to, reciprocate, these, social, motivations, match, what, evolutionary, psychologists, expect, to, see, in, adaptations, that, evolved, to, maximize, the, benefits, and, minimize, the, drawbacks, of, reciprocity, evolutionary, psychologists, say, that, humans, have, psychological, adaptations, that, evolved, specifically, to, help, us, identify, nonreciprocators, commonly, referred, to, as, cheaters, in, 1993, robert, frank, and, his, associates, found, that, participants, in, a, prisoner, s, dilemma, scenario, were, often, able, to, predict, whether, their, partners, would, cheat, based, on, a, half, hour, of, unstructured, social, interaction, in, a, 1996, experiment, for, example, linda, mealey, and, her, colleagues, found, that, people, were, better, at, remembering, the, faces, of, people, when, those, faces, were, associated, with, stories, about, those, individuals, cheating, such, as, embezzling, money, from, a, church, humans, may, have, an, evolved, set, of, psychological, adaptations, that, predispose, them, to, be, more, cooperative, than, otherwise, would, be, expected, with, members, of, their, tribal, in, group, and, more, nasty, to, members, of, tribal, out, groups, these, adaptations, may, have, been, a, consequence, of, tribal, warfare, humans, may, also, have, predispositions, for, altruistic, punishment, to, punish, in, group, members, who, violate, in, group, rules, even, when, this, altruistic, behavior, cannot, be, justified, in, terms, of, helping, those, you, are, related, to, kin, selection, cooperating, with, those, who, you, will, interact, with, again, direct, reciprocity, or, cooperating, to, better, your, reputation, with, others, indirect, reciprocity, though, evolutionary, psychology, has, traditionally, focused, on, individual, level, behaviors, determined, by, species, typical, psychological, adaptations, considerable, work, has, been, done, on, how, these, adaptations, shape, and, ultimately, govern, culture, tooby, and, cosmides, 1989, tooby, and, cosmides, 1989, argued, that, the, mind, consists, of, many, domain, specific, psychological, adaptations, some, of, which, may, constrain, what, cultural, material, is, learned, or, taught, as, opposed, to, a, domain, general, cultural, acquisition, program, where, an, individual, passively, receives, culturally, transmitted, material, from, the, group, tooby, and, cosmides, 1989, among, others, argue, that, the, psyche, evolved, to, generate, adaptive, rather, than, repetitive, behavior, and, hence, critically, analyzes, the, behavior, of, those, surrounding, it, in, highly, structured, and, patterned, ways, to, be, used, as, a, rich, but, by, no, means, the, only, source, of, information, out, of, which, to, construct, a, private, culture, or, individually, tailored, adaptive, system, in, consequence, this, system, may, or, may, not, mirror, the, behavior, of, others, in, any, given, respect, tooby, and, cosmides, 1989, biological, explanations, of, human, culture, also, brought, criticism, to, evolutionary, psychology, evolutionary, psychologists, see, the, human, psyche, and, physiology, as, a, genetic, product, and, assume, that, genes, contain, the, information, for, the, development, and, control, of, the, organism, and, that, this, information, is, transmitted, from, one, generation, to, the, next, via, genes, evolutionary, psychologists, thereby, see, physical, and, psychological, characteristics, of, humans, as, genetically, programmed, even, then, when, evolutionary, psychologists, acknowledge, the, influence, of, the, environment, on, human, development, they, understand, the, environment, only, as, an, activator, or, trigger, for, the, programmed, developmental, instructions, encoded, in, genes, evolutionary, psychologists, for, example, believe, that, the, human, brain, is, made, up, of, innate, modules, each, of, which, is, specialised, only, for, very, specific, tasks, e, g, an, anxiety, module, according, to, evolutionary, psychologists, these, modules, are, given, before, the, organism, actually, develops, and, are, then, activated, by, some, environmental, event, critics, object, that, this, view, is, reductionist, and, that, cognitive, specialisation, only, comes, about, through, the, interaction, of, humans, with, their, real, environment, rather, than, the, environment, of, distant, ancestors, interdisciplinary, approaches, are, increasingly, striving, to, mediate, between, these, opposing, points, of, view, and, to, highlight, that, biological, and, cultural, causes, need, not, be, antithetical, in, explaining, human, behaviour, and, even, complex, cultural, achievements, according, to, paul, baltes, the, benefits, granted, by, evolutionary, selection, decrease, with, age, natural, selection, has, not, eliminated, many, harmful, conditions, and, nonadaptive, characteristics, that, appear, among, older, adults, such, as, alzheimer, disease, if, it, were, a, disease, that, killed, 20, year, olds, instead, of, 70, year, olds, this, might, have, been, a, disease, that, natural, selection, could, have, eliminated, ages, ago, thus, unaided, by, evolutionary, pressures, against, nonadaptive, conditions, modern, humans, suffer, the, aches, pains, and, infirmities, of, aging, and, as, the, benefits, of, evolutionary, selection, decrease, with, age, the, need, for, modern, technological, mediums, against, non, adaptive, conditions, increases, as, humans, are, a, highly, social, species, there, are, many, adaptive, problems, associated, with, navigating, the, social, world, e, g, maintaining, allies, managing, status, hierarchies, interacting, with, outgroup, members, coordinating, social, activities, collective, decision, making, researchers, in, the, emerging, field, of, evolutionary, social, psychology, have, made, many, discoveries, pertaining, to, topics, traditionally, studied, by, social, psychologists, including, person, perception, social, cognition, attitudes, altruism, emotions, group, dynamics, leadership, motivation, prejudice, intergroup, relations, and, cross, cultural, differences, when, endeavouring, to, solve, a, problem, humans, at, an, early, age, show, determination, while, chimpanzees, have, no, comparable, facial, expression, researchers, suspect, the, human, determined, expression, evolved, because, when, a, human, is, determinedly, working, on, a, problem, other, people, will, frequently, help, adaptationist, hypotheses, regarding, the, etiology, of, psychological, disorders, are, often, based, on, analogies, between, physiological, and, psychological, dysfunctions, as, noted, in, the, table, below, prominent, theorists, and, evolutionary, psychiatrists, include, michael, t, mcguire, anthony, stevens, and, randolph, m, nesse, they, and, others, suggest, that, mental, disorders, are, due, to, the, interactive, effects, of, both, nature, and, nurture, and, often, have, multiple, contributing, causes, evolutionary, psychologists, have, suggested, that, schizophrenia, and, bipolar, disorder, may, reflect, a, side, effect, of, genes, with, fitness, benefits, such, as, increased, creativity, some, individuals, with, bipolar, disorder, are, especially, creative, during, their, manic, phases, and, the, close, relatives, of, people, with, schizophrenia, have, been, found, to, be, more, likely, to, have, creative, professions, a, 1994, report, by, the, american, psychiatry, association, found, that, people, with, schizophrenia, at, roughly, the, same, rate, in, western, and, non, western, cultures, and, in, industrialized, and, pastoral, societies, suggesting, that, schizophrenia, is, not, a, disease, of, civilization, nor, an, arbitrary, social, invention, sociopathy, may, represent, an, evolutionarily, stable, strategy, by, which, a, small, number, of, people, who, cheat, on, social, contracts, benefit, in, a, society, consisting, mostly, of, non, sociopaths, mild, depression, may, be, an, adaptive, response, to, withdraw, from, and, re, evaluate, situations, that, have, led, to, disadvantageous, outcomes, the, analytical, rumination, hypothesis, see, evolutionary, approaches, to, depression, some, of, these, speculations, have, yet, to, be, developed, into, fully, testable, hypotheses, and, a, great, deal, of, research, is, required, to, confirm, their, validity, evolutionary, psychology, has, been, applied, to, explain, criminal, or, otherwise, immoral, behavior, as, being, adaptive, or, related, to, adaptive, behaviors, males, are, generally, more, aggressive, than, females, who, are, more, selective, of, their, partners, because, of, the, far, greater, effort, they, have, to, contribute, to, pregnancy, and, child, rearing, males, being, more, aggressive, is, hypothesized, to, stem, from, the, more, intense, reproductive, competition, faced, by, them, males, of, low, status, may, be, especially, vulnerable, to, being, childless, it, may, have, been, evolutionary, advantageous, to, engage, in, highly, risky, and, violently, aggressive, behavior, to, increase, their, status, and, therefore, reproductive, success, this, may, explain, why, males, are, generally, involved, in, more, crimes, and, why, low, status, and, being, unmarried, are, associated, with, criminality, furthermore, competition, over, females, is, argued, to, have, been, particularly, intensive, in, late, adolescence, and, young, adulthood, which, is, theorized, to, explain, why, crime, rates, are, particularly, high, during, this, period, some, sociologists, have, underlined, differential, exposure, to, androgens, as, the, cause, of, these, behaviors, notably, lee, ellis, in, his, evolutionary, neuroandrogenic, ena, theory, many, conflicts, that, result, in, harm, and, death, involve, status, reputation, and, seemingly, trivial, insults, steven, pinker, in, his, book, the, better, angels, of, our, nature, argues, that, in, non, state, societies, without, a, police, it, was, very, important, to, have, a, credible, deterrence, against, aggression, therefore, it, was, important, to, be, perceived, as, having, a, credible, reputation, for, retaliation, resulting, in, humans, developing, instincts, for, revenge, as, well, as, for, protecting, reputation, honor, pinker, argues, that, the, development, of, the, state, and, the, police, have, dramatically, reduced, the, level, of, violence, compared, to, the, ancestral, environment, whenever, the, state, breaks, down, which, can, be, very, locally, such, as, in, poor, areas, of, a, city, humans, again, organize, in, groups, for, protection, and, aggression, and, concepts, such, as, violent, revenge, and, protecting, honor, again, become, extremely, important, rape, is, theorized, to, be, a, reproductive, strategy, that, facilitates, the, propagation, of, the, rapist, s, progeny, such, a, strategy, may, be, adopted, by, men, who, otherwise, are, unlikely, to, be, appealing, to, women, and, therefore, cannot, form, legitimate, relationships, or, by, high, status, men, on, socially, vulnerable, women, who, are, unlikely, to, retaliate, to, increase, their, reproductive, success, even, further, the, sociobiological, theories, of, rape, are, highly, controversial, as, traditional, theories, typically, do, not, consider, rape, to, be, a, behavioral, adaptation, and, objections, to, this, theory, are, made, on, ethical, religious, political, as, well, as, scientific, grounds, adaptationist, perspectives, on, religious, belief, suggest, that, like, all, behavior, religious, behaviors, are, a, product, of, the, human, brain, as, with, all, other, organ, functions, cognition, s, functional, structure, has, been, argued, to, have, a, genetic, foundation, and, is, therefore, subject, to, the, effects, of, natural, selection, and, sexual, selection, like, other, organs, and, tissues, this, functional, structure, should, be, universally, shared, amongst, humans, and, should, have, solved, important, problems, of, survival, and, reproduction, in, ancestral, environments, however, evolutionary, psychologists, remain, divided, on, whether, religious, belief, is, more, likely, a, consequence, of, evolved, psychological, adaptations, or, a, byproduct, of, other, cognitive, adaptations, coalitional, psychology, is, an, approach, to, explain, political, behaviors, between, different, coalitions, and, the, conditionality, of, these, behaviors, in, evolutionary, psychological, perspective, this, approach, assumes, that, since, human, beings, appeared, on, the, earth, they, have, evolved, to, live, in, groups, instead, of, living, as, individuals, to, achieve, benefits, such, as, more, mating, opportunities, and, increased, status, human, beings, thus, naturally, think, and, act, in, a, way, that, manages, and, negotiates, group, dynamics, coalitional, psychology, offers, falsifiable, ex, ante, prediction, by, positing, five, hypotheses, on, how, these, psychological, adaptations, operate, critics, of, evolutionary, psychology, accuse, it, of, promoting, genetic, determinism, pan, adaptationism, the, idea, that, all, behaviors, and, anatomical, features, are, adaptations, unfalsifiable, hypotheses, distal, or, ultimate, explanations, of, behavior, when, proximate, explanations, are, superior, and, malevolent, political, or, moral, ideas, critics, have, argued, that, evolutionary, psychology, might, be, used, to, justify, existing, social, hierarchies, and, reactionary, policies, it, has, also, been, suggested, by, critics, that, evolutionary, psychologists, theories, and, interpretations, of, empirical, data, rely, heavily, on, ideological, assumptions, about, race, and, gender, in, response, to, such, criticism, evolutionary, psychologists, often, caution, against, committing, the, naturalistic, fallacy, the, assumption, that, what, is, natural, is, necessarily, a, moral, good, however, their, caution, against, committing, the, naturalistic, fallacy, has, been, criticized, as, means, to, stifle, legitimate, ethical, discussions, some, criticisms, of, evolutionary, psychology, point, at, contradictions, between, different, aspects, of, adaptive, scenarios, posited, by, evolutionary, psychology, one, example, is, the, evolutionary, psychology, model, of, extended, social, groups, selecting, for, modern, human, brains, a, contradiction, being, that, the, synaptic, function, of, modern, human, brains, require, high, amounts, of, many, specific, essential, nutrients, so, that, such, a, transition, to, higher, requirements, of, the, same, essential, nutrients, being, shared, by, all, individuals, in, a, population, would, decrease, the, possibility, of, forming, large, groups, due, to, bottleneck, foods, with, rare, essential, nutrients, capping, group, sizes, it, is, mentioned, that, some, insects, have, societies, with, different, ranks, for, each, individual, and, that, monkeys, remain, socially, functioning, after, the, removal, of, most, of, the, brain, as, additional, arguments, against, big, brains, promoting, social, networking, the, model, of, males, as, both, providers, and, protectors, is, criticized, for, the, impossibility, of, being, in, two, places, at, once, the, male, cannot, both, protect, his, family, at, home, and, be, out, hunting, at, the, same, time, in, the, case, of, the, claim, that, a, provider, male, could, buy, protection, service, for, his, family, from, other, males, by, bartering, food, that, he, had, hunted, critics, point, at, the, fact, that, the, most, valuable, food, the, food, that, contained, the, rarest, essential, nutrients, would, be, different, in, different, ecologies, and, as, such, vegetable, in, some, geographical, areas, and, animal, in, others, making, it, impossible, for, hunting, styles, relying, on, physical, strength, or, risk, taking, to, be, universally, of, similar, value, in, bartered, food, and, instead, of, making, it, inevitable, that, in, some, parts, of, africa, food, gathered, with, no, need, for, major, physical, strength, would, be, the, most, valuable, to, barter, for, protection, a, contradiction, between, evolutionary, psychology, s, claim, of, men, needing, to, be, more, sexually, visual, than, women, for, fast, speed, of, assessing, women, s, fertility, than, women, needed, to, be, able, to, assess, the, male, s, genes, and, its, claim, of, male, sexual, jealousy, guarding, against, infidelity, is, also, pointed, at, as, it, would, be, pointless, for, a, male, to, be, fast, to, assess, female, fertility, if, he, needed, to, assess, the, risk, of, there, being, a, jealous, male, mate, and, in, that, case, his, chances, of, defeating, him, before, mating, anyway, pointlessness, of, assessing, one, necessary, condition, faster, than, another, necessary, condition, can, possibly, be, assessed, evolutionary, psychology, has, been, entangled, in, the, larger, philosophical, and, social, science, controversies, related, to, the, debate, on, nature, versus, nurture, evolutionary, psychologists, typically, contrast, evolutionary, psychology, with, what, they, call, the, standard, social, science, model, sssm, they, characterize, the, sssm, as, the, blank, slate, relativist, social, constructionist, and, cultural, determinist, perspective, that, they, say, dominated, the, social, sciences, throughout, the, 20th, century, and, assumed, that, the, mind, was, shaped, almost, entirely, by, culture, critics, have, argued, that, evolutionary, psychologists, created, a, false, dichotomy, between, their, own, view, and, the, caricature, of, the, sssm, other, critics, regard, the, sssm, as, a, rhetorical, device, or, a, straw, man, and, suggest, that, the, scientists, whom, evolutionary, psychologists, associate, with, the, sssm, did, not, believe, that, the, mind, was, a, blank, state, devoid, of, any, natural, predispositions, some, critics, view, evolutionary, psychology, as, a, form, of, genetic, reductionism, and, genetic, determinism, a, common, critique, being, that, evolutionary, psychology, does, not, address, the, complexity, of, individual, development, and, experience, and, fails, to, explain, the, influence, of, genes, on, behavior, in, individual, cases, evolutionary, psychologists, respond, that, they, are, working, within, a, nature, nurture, interactionist, framework, that, acknowledges, that, many, psychological, adaptations, are, facultative, sensitive, to, environmental, variations, during, individual, development, the, discipline, is, generally, not, focused, on, proximate, analyses, of, behavior, but, rather, its, focus, is, on, the, study, of, distal, ultimate, causality, the, evolution, of, psychological, adaptations, the, field, of, behavioral, genetics, is, focused, on, the, study, of, the, proximate, influence, of, genes, on, behavior, a, frequent, critique, of, the, discipline, is, that, the, hypotheses, of, evolutionary, psychology, are, frequently, arbitrary, and, difficult, or, impossible, to, adequately, test, thus, questioning, its, status, as, an, actual, scientific, discipline, for, example, because, many, current, traits, probably, evolved, to, serve, different, functions, than, they, do, now, thus, because, there, are, a, potentially, infinite, number, of, alternative, explanations, for, why, a, trait, evolved, critics, contend, that, it, is, impossible, to, determine, the, exact, explanation, while, evolutionary, psychology, hypotheses, are, difficult, to, test, evolutionary, psychologists, assert, that, it, is, not, impossible, part, of, the, critique, of, the, scientific, base, of, evolutionary, psychology, includes, a, critique, of, the, concept, of, the, environment, of, evolutionary, adaptation, eea, some, critics, have, argued, that, researchers, know, so, little, about, the, environment, in, which, homo, sapiens, evolved, that, explaining, specific, traits, as, an, adaption, to, that, environment, becomes, highly, speculative, evolutionary, psychologists, respond, that, they, do, know, many, things, about, this, environment, including, the, facts, that, present, day, humans, ancestors, were, hunter, gatherers, that, they, generally, lived, in, small, tribes, etc, edward, hagen, argues, that, the, human, past, environments, were, not, radically, different, in, the, same, sense, as, the, carboniferous, or, jurassic, periods, and, that, the, animal, and, plant, taxa, of, the, era, were, similar, to, those, of, the, modern, world, as, was, the, geology, and, ecology, hagen, argues, that, few, would, deny, that, other, organs, evolved, in, the, eea, for, example, lungs, evolving, in, an, oxygen, rich, atmosphere, yet, critics, question, whether, or, not, the, brain, s, eea, is, truly, knowable, which, he, argues, constitutes, selective, scepticism, hagen, also, argues, that, most, evolutionary, psychology, research, is, based, on, the, fact, that, females, can, get, pregnant, and, males, cannot, which, hagen, observes, was, also, true, in, the, eea, john, alcock, describes, this, as, the, no, time, machine, argument, as, critics, are, arguing, that, since, it, is, not, possible, to, travel, back, in, time, to, the, eea, then, it, cannot, be, determined, what, was, going, on, there, and, thus, what, was, adaptive, alcock, argues, that, present, day, evidence, allows, researchers, to, be, reasonably, confident, about, the, conditions, of, the, eea, and, that, the, fact, that, so, many, human, behaviours, are, adaptive, in, the, current, environment, is, evidence, that, the, ancestral, environment, of, humans, had, much, in, common, with, the, present, one, as, these, behaviours, would, have, evolved, in, the, ancestral, environment, thus, alcock, concludes, that, researchers, can, make, predictions, on, the, adaptive, value, of, traits, similarly, dominic, murphy, argues, that, alternative, explanations, cannot, just, be, forwarded, but, instead, need, their, own, evidence, and, predictions, if, one, explanation, makes, predictions, that, the, others, cannot, it, is, reasonable, to, have, confidence, in, that, explanation, in, addition, murphy, argues, that, other, historical, sciences, also, make, predictions, about, modern, phenomena, to, come, up, with, explanations, about, past, phenomena, for, example, cosmologists, look, for, evidence, for, what, we, would, expect, to, see, in, the, modern, day, if, the, big, bang, was, true, while, geologists, make, predictions, about, modern, phenomena, to, determine, if, an, asteroid, wiped, out, the, dinosaurs, murphy, argues, that, if, other, historical, disciplines, can, conduct, tests, without, a, time, machine, then, the, onus, is, on, the, critics, to, show, why, evolutionary, psychology, is, untestable, if, other, historical, disciplines, are, not, as, methods, should, be, judged, across, the, board, not, singled, out, for, ridicule, in, one, context, evolutionary, psychologists, generally, presume, that, like, the, body, the, mind, is, made, up, of, many, evolved, modular, adaptations, although, there, is, some, disagreement, within, the, discipline, regarding, the, degree, of, general, plasticity, or, generality, of, some, modules, it, has, been, suggested, that, modularity, evolves, because, compared, to, non, modular, networks, it, would, have, conferred, an, advantage, in, terms, of, fitness, and, because, connection, costs, are, lower, in, contrast, some, academics, argue, that, it, is, unnecessary, to, posit, the, existence, of, highly, domain, specific, modules, and, suggest, that, the, neural, anatomy, of, the, brain, supports, a, model, based, on, more, domain, general, faculties, and, processes, moreover, empirical, support, for, the, domain, specific, theory, stems, almost, entirely, from, performance, on, variations, of, the, wason, selection, task, which, is, extremely, limited, in, scope, as, it, only, tests, one, subtype, of, deductive, reasoning, psychologist, cecilia, heyes, has, argued, that, the, picture, presented, by, some, evolutionary, psychology, of, the, human, mind, as, a, collection, of, cognitive, instincts, organs, of, thought, shaped, by, genetic, evolution, over, very, long, time, periods, does, not, fit, research, results, she, posits, instead, that, humans, have, cognitive, gadgets, special, purpose, organs, of, thought, built, in, the, course, of, development, through, social, interaction, similar, criticisms, are, articulated, by, subrena, e, smith, of, the, university, of, new, hampshire, evolutionary, psychologists, have, addressed, many, of, their, critics, e, g, in, books, by, segerstr, le, 2000, barkow, 2005, and, alcock, 2001, among, their, rebuttals, are, that, some, criticisms, are, straw, men, or, are, based, on, an, incorrect, nature, versus, nurture, dichotomy, or, on, basic, misunderstandings, of, the, discipline, robert, kurzban, suggested, that, critics, of, the, field, when, they, err, are, not, slightly, missing, the, mark, their, confusion, is, deep, and, profound, it, s, not, like, they, are, marksmen, who, can, t, quite, hit, the, center, of, the, target, they, re, holding, the, gun, backwards, many, have, written, specifically, to, correct, basic, misconceptions
