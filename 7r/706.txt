https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism
behaviorism, is, a, systematic, approach, to, understand, the, behavior, of, humans, and, other, animals, it, assumes, that, behavior, is, either, a, reflex, elicited, by, the, pairing, of, certain, antecedent, stimuli, in, the, environment, or, a, consequence, of, that, individual, s, history, including, especially, reinforcement, and, punishment, contingencies, together, with, the, individual, s, current, motivational, state, and, controlling, stimuli, although, behaviorists, generally, accept, the, important, role, of, heredity, in, determining, behavior, they, focus, primarily, on, environmental, events, the, cognitive, revolution, of, the, late, 20th, century, largely, replaced, behaviorism, as, an, explanatory, theory, with, cognitive, psychology, which, unlike, behaviorism, views, internal, mental, states, as, explanations, for, observable, behavior, behaviorism, emerged, in, the, early, 1900s, as, a, reaction, to, depth, psychology, and, other, traditional, forms, of, psychology, which, often, had, difficulty, making, predictions, that, could, be, tested, experimentally, it, was, derived, from, earlier, research, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, such, as, when, edward, thorndike, pioneered, the, law, of, effect, a, procedure, that, involved, the, use, of, consequences, to, strengthen, or, weaken, behavior, with, a, 1924, publication, john, b, watson, devised, methodological, behaviorism, which, rejected, introspective, methods, and, sought, to, understand, behavior, by, only, measuring, observable, behaviors, and, events, it, was, not, until, 1945, that, b, f, skinner, proposed, that, covert, behavior, including, cognition, and, emotions, are, subject, to, the, same, controlling, variables, as, observable, behavior, which, became, the, basis, for, his, philosophy, called, radical, behaviorism, while, watson, and, ivan, pavlov, investigated, how, conditioned, neutral, stimuli, elicit, reflexes, in, respondent, conditioning, skinner, assessed, the, reinforcement, histories, of, the, discriminative, antecedent, stimuli, that, emits, behavior, the, process, became, known, as, operant, conditioning, the, application, of, radical, behaviorism, known, as, applied, behavior, analysis, is, used, in, a, variety, of, contexts, including, for, example, applied, animal, behavior, and, organizational, behavior, management, to, treatment, of, mental, disorders, such, as, autism, and, substance, abuse, in, addition, while, behaviorism, and, cognitive, schools, of, psychological, thought, do, not, agree, theoretically, they, have, complemented, each, other, in, the, cognitive, behavioral, therapies, which, have, demonstrated, utility, in, treating, certain, pathologies, including, simple, phobias, ptsd, and, mood, disorders, the, titles, given, to, the, various, branches, of, behaviorism, include, two, subtypes, of, theoretical, behaviorism, are, b, f, skinner, proposed, radical, behaviorism, as, the, conceptual, underpinning, of, the, experimental, analysis, of, behavior, this, viewpoint, differs, from, other, approaches, to, behavioral, research, in, various, ways, but, most, notably, here, it, contrasts, with, methodological, behaviorism, in, accepting, feelings, states, of, mind, and, introspection, as, behaviors, also, subject, to, scientific, investigation, like, methodological, behaviorism, it, rejects, the, reflex, as, a, model, of, all, behavior, and, it, defends, the, science, of, behavior, as, complementary, to, but, independent, of, physiology, radical, behaviorism, overlaps, considerably, with, other, western, philosophical, positions, such, as, american, pragmatism, although, john, b, watson, mainly, emphasized, his, position, of, methodological, behaviorism, throughout, his, career, watson, and, rosalie, rayner, conducted, the, infamous, little, albert, experiment, 1920, a, study, in, which, ivan, pavlov, s, theory, to, respondent, conditioning, was, first, applied, to, eliciting, a, fearful, reflex, of, crying, in, a, human, infant, and, this, became, the, launching, point, for, understanding, covert, behavior, or, private, events, in, radical, behaviorism, however, skinner, felt, that, aversive, stimuli, should, only, be, experimented, on, with, animals, and, spoke, out, against, watson, for, testing, something, so, controversial, on, a, human, in, 1959, skinner, observed, the, emotions, of, two, pigeons, by, noting, that, they, appeared, angry, because, their, feathers, ruffled, the, pigeons, were, placed, together, in, an, operant, chamber, where, they, were, aggressive, as, a, consequence, of, previous, reinforcement, in, the, environment, through, stimulus, control, and, subsequent, discrimination, training, whenever, skinner, turned, off, the, green, light, the, pigeons, came, to, notice, that, the, food, reinforcer, is, discontinued, following, each, peck, and, responded, without, aggression, skinner, concluded, that, humans, also, learn, aggression, and, possess, such, emotions, as, well, as, other, private, events, no, differently, than, do, nonhuman, animals, as, experimental, behavioural, psychology, is, related, to, behavioral, neuroscience, we, can, date, the, first, researches, in, the, area, were, done, in, the, beginning, of, 19th, century, later, this, essentially, philosophical, position, gained, strength, from, the, success, of, skinner, s, early, experimental, work, with, rats, and, pigeons, summarized, in, his, books, the, behavior, of, organisms, and, schedules, of, reinforcement, of, particular, importance, was, his, concept, of, the, operant, response, of, which, the, canonical, example, was, the, rat, s, lever, press, in, contrast, with, the, idea, of, a, physiological, or, reflex, response, an, operant, is, a, class, of, structurally, distinct, but, functionally, equivalent, responses, for, example, while, a, rat, might, press, a, lever, with, its, left, paw, or, its, right, paw, or, its, tail, all, of, these, responses, operate, on, the, world, in, the, same, way, and, have, a, common, consequence, operants, are, often, thought, of, as, species, of, responses, where, the, individuals, differ, but, the, class, coheres, in, its, function, shared, consequences, with, operants, and, reproductive, success, with, species, this, is, a, clear, distinction, between, skinner, s, theory, and, s, r, theory, skinner, s, empirical, work, expanded, on, earlier, research, on, trial, and, error, learning, by, researchers, such, as, thorndike, and, guthrie, with, both, conceptual, reformulations, thorndike, s, notion, of, a, stimulus, response, association, or, connection, was, abandoned, and, methodological, ones, the, use, of, the, free, operant, so, called, because, the, animal, was, now, permitted, to, respond, at, its, own, rate, rather, than, in, a, series, of, trials, determined, by, the, experimenter, procedures, with, this, method, skinner, carried, out, substantial, experimental, work, on, the, effects, of, different, schedules, and, rates, of, reinforcement, on, the, rates, of, operant, responses, made, by, rats, and, pigeons, he, achieved, remarkable, success, in, training, animals, to, perform, unexpected, responses, to, emit, large, numbers, of, responses, and, to, demonstrate, many, empirical, regularities, at, the, purely, behavioral, level, this, lent, some, credibility, to, his, conceptual, analysis, it, is, largely, his, conceptual, analysis, that, made, his, work, much, more, rigorous, than, his, peers, a, point, which, can, be, seen, clearly, in, his, seminal, work, are, theories, of, learning, necessary, in, which, he, criticizes, what, he, viewed, to, be, theoretical, weaknesses, then, common, in, the, study, of, psychology, an, important, descendant, of, the, experimental, analysis, of, behavior, is, the, society, for, quantitative, analysis, of, behavior, as, skinner, turned, from, experimental, work, to, concentrate, on, the, philosophical, underpinnings, of, a, science, of, behavior, his, attention, turned, to, human, language, with, his, 1957, book, verbal, behavior, and, other, language, related, publications, verbal, behavior, laid, out, a, vocabulary, and, theory, for, functional, analysis, of, verbal, behavior, and, was, strongly, criticized, in, a, review, by, noam, chomsky, skinner, did, not, respond, in, detail, but, claimed, that, chomsky, failed, to, understand, his, ideas, and, the, disagreements, between, the, two, and, the, theories, involved, have, been, further, discussed, innateness, theory, which, has, been, heavily, critiqued, is, opposed, to, behaviorist, theory, which, claims, that, language, is, a, set, of, habits, that, can, be, acquired, by, means, of, conditioning, according, to, some, the, behaviorist, account, is, a, process, which, would, be, too, slow, to, explain, a, phenomenon, as, complicated, as, language, learning, what, was, important, for, a, behaviorist, s, analysis, of, human, behavior, was, not, language, acquisition, so, much, as, the, interaction, between, language, and, overt, behavior, in, an, essay, republished, in, his, 1969, book, contingencies, of, reinforcement, skinner, took, the, view, that, humans, could, construct, linguistic, stimuli, that, would, then, acquire, control, over, their, behavior, in, the, same, way, that, external, stimuli, could, the, possibility, of, such, instructional, control, over, behavior, meant, that, contingencies, of, reinforcement, would, not, always, produce, the, same, effects, on, human, behavior, as, they, reliably, do, in, other, animals, the, focus, of, a, radical, behaviorist, analysis, of, human, behavior, therefore, shifted, to, an, attempt, to, understand, the, interaction, between, instructional, control, and, contingency, control, and, also, to, understand, the, behavioral, processes, that, determine, what, instructions, are, constructed, and, what, control, they, acquire, over, behavior, recently, a, new, line, of, behavioral, research, on, language, was, started, under, the, name, of, relational, frame, theory, b, f, skinner, s, book, verbal, behavior, 1957, does, not, quite, emphasize, on, language, development, but, to, understand, human, behavior, additionally, his, work, serves, in, understanding, social, interactions, in, the, child, s, early, developmental, stages, focusing, on, the, topic, of, caregiver, infant, interaction, skinner, s, functional, analysis, of, verbal, behavior, terminology, and, theories, is, commonly, used, to, understand, the, relationship, between, language, development, but, was, primarily, designed, to, describe, behaviors, of, interest, and, explain, the, cause, of, those, behaviors, noam, chomsky, an, american, linguistic, professor, has, criticized, and, questioned, skinner, s, theories, about, the, possible, suggestion, of, parental, tutoring, in, language, development, however, there, is, a, lack, of, supporting, evidence, where, skinner, makes, the, statement, understanding, language, is, a, complex, topic, but, can, be, understood, through, the, use, of, two, theories, innateness, and, acquisition, both, theories, offer, a, different, perspective, whether, language, is, inherently, acquired, or, learned, operant, conditioning, was, developed, by, b, f, skinner, in, 1938, and, is, form, of, learning, in, which, the, frequency, of, a, behavior, is, controlled, by, consequences, to, change, behavior, in, other, words, behavior, is, controlled, by, historical, consequential, contingencies, particularly, reinforcement, a, stimulus, that, increases, the, probability, of, performing, behaviors, and, punishment, a, stimulus, that, decreases, such, probability, the, core, tools, of, consequences, are, either, positive, presenting, stimuli, following, a, response, or, negative, withdrawn, stimuli, following, a, response, the, following, descriptions, explains, the, concepts, of, four, common, types, of, consequences, in, operant, conditioning, a, classical, experiment, in, operant, conditioning, for, example, is, the, skinner, box, puzzle, box, or, operant, conditioning, chamber, to, test, the, effects, of, operant, conditioning, principles, on, rats, cats, and, other, species, from, this, experiment, he, discovered, that, the, rats, learned, very, effectively, if, they, were, rewarded, frequently, with, food, skinner, also, found, that, he, could, shape, create, new, behavior, the, rats, behavior, through, the, use, of, rewards, which, could, in, turn, be, applied, to, human, learning, as, well, skinner, s, model, was, based, on, the, premise, that, reinforcement, is, used, for, the, desired, actions, or, responses, while, punishment, was, used, to, stop, the, responses, of, the, undesired, actions, that, are, not, this, theory, proved, that, humans, or, animals, will, repeat, any, action, that, leads, to, a, positive, outcome, and, avoid, any, action, that, leads, to, a, negative, outcome, the, experiment, with, the, pigeons, showed, that, a, positive, outcome, leads, to, learned, behavior, since, the, pigeon, learned, to, peck, the, disc, in, return, for, the, reward, of, food, these, historical, consequential, contingencies, subsequently, lead, to, antecedent, stimulus, control, but, in, contrast, to, respondent, conditioning, where, antecedent, stimuli, elicit, reflexive, behavior, operant, behavior, is, only, emitted, and, therefore, does, not, force, its, occurrence, it, includes, the, following, controlling, stimuli, although, operant, conditioning, plays, the, largest, role, in, discussions, of, behavioral, mechanisms, respondent, conditioning, also, called, pavlovian, or, classical, conditioning, is, also, an, important, behavior, analytic, process, that, needs, not, refer, to, mental, or, other, internal, processes, pavlov, s, experiments, with, dogs, provide, the, most, familiar, example, of, the, classical, conditioning, procedure, in, the, beginning, the, dog, was, provided, meat, unconditioned, stimulus, ucs, naturally, elicit, a, response, that, is, not, controlled, to, eat, resulting, in, increased, salivation, unconditioned, response, ucr, which, means, that, a, response, is, naturally, caused, by, ucs, afterward, a, bell, ring, was, presented, together, with, food, to, the, dog, although, bell, ring, was, a, neutral, stimulus, ns, meaning, that, the, stimulus, did, not, have, any, effect, dog, would, start, to, salivate, when, only, hearing, a, bell, ring, after, a, number, of, pairings, eventually, the, neutral, stimulus, bell, ring, became, conditioned, therefore, salivation, was, elicited, as, a, conditioned, response, the, response, same, as, the, unconditioned, response, pairing, up, with, meat, the, conditioned, stimulus, although, pavlov, proposed, some, tentative, physiological, processes, that, might, be, involved, in, classical, conditioning, these, have, not, been, confirmed, the, idea, of, classical, conditioning, helped, behaviorist, john, watson, discover, the, key, mechanism, behind, how, humans, acquire, the, behaviors, that, they, do, which, was, to, find, a, natural, reflex, that, produces, the, response, being, considered, watson, s, behaviourist, manifesto, has, three, aspects, that, deserve, special, recognition, one, is, that, psychology, should, be, purely, objective, with, any, interpretation, of, conscious, experience, being, removed, thus, leading, to, psychology, as, the, science, of, behaviour, the, second, one, is, that, the, goals, of, psychology, should, be, to, predict, and, control, behaviour, as, opposed, to, describe, and, explain, conscious, mental, states, the, third, one, is, that, there, is, no, notable, distinction, between, human, and, non, human, behaviour, following, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, this, would, simply, mean, that, human, behaviour, is, just, a, more, complex, version, in, respect, to, behaviour, displayed, by, other, species, behaviorism, is, a, psychological, movement, that, can, be, contrasted, with, philosophy, of, mind, the, basic, premise, of, behaviorism, is, that, the, study, of, behavior, should, be, a, natural, science, such, as, chemistry, or, physics, initially, behaviorism, rejected, any, reference, to, hypothetical, inner, states, of, organisms, as, causes, for, their, behavior, but, b, f, skinner, s, radical, behaviorism, reintroduced, reference, to, inner, states, and, also, advocated, for, the, study, of, thoughts, and, feelings, as, behaviors, subject, to, the, same, mechanisms, as, external, behavior, behaviorism, takes, a, functional, view, of, behavior, according, to, edmund, fantino, and, colleagues, behavior, analysis, has, much, to, offer, the, study, of, phenomena, normally, dominated, by, cognitive, and, social, psychologists, we, hope, that, successful, application, of, behavioral, theory, and, methodology, will, not, only, shed, light, on, central, problems, in, judgment, and, choice, but, will, also, generate, greater, appreciation, of, the, behavioral, approach, behaviorist, sentiments, are, not, uncommon, within, philosophy, of, language, and, analytic, philosophy, it, is, sometimes, argued, that, ludwig, wittgenstein, defended, a, logical, behaviorist, position, e, g, the, beetle, in, a, box, argument, in, logical, positivism, as, held, e, g, by, rudolf, carnap, and, carl, hempel, the, meaning, of, psychological, statements, are, their, verification, conditions, which, consist, of, performed, overt, behavior, w, v, o, quine, made, use, of, a, type, of, behaviorism, influenced, by, some, of, skinner, s, ideas, in, his, own, work, on, language, quine, s, work, in, semantics, differed, substantially, from, the, empiricist, semantics, of, carnap, which, he, attempted, to, create, an, alternative, to, couching, his, semantic, theory, in, references, to, physical, objects, rather, than, sensations, gilbert, ryle, defended, a, distinct, strain, of, philosophical, behaviorism, sketched, in, his, book, the, concept, of, mind, ryle, s, central, claim, was, that, instances, of, dualism, frequently, represented, category, mistakes, and, hence, that, they, were, really, misunderstandings, of, the, use, of, ordinary, language, daniel, dennett, likewise, acknowledges, himself, to, be, a, type, of, behaviorist, though, he, offers, extensive, criticism, of, radical, behaviorism, and, refutes, skinner, s, rejection, of, the, value, of, intentional, idioms, and, the, possibility, of, free, will, this, is, dennett, s, main, point, in, skinner, skinned, dennett, argues, that, there, is, a, crucial, difference, between, explaining, and, explaining, away, if, our, explanation, of, apparently, rational, behavior, turns, out, to, be, extremely, simple, we, may, want, to, say, that, the, behavior, was, not, really, rational, after, all, but, if, the, explanation, is, very, complex, and, intricate, we, may, want, to, say, not, that, the, behavior, is, not, rational, but, that, we, now, have, a, better, understanding, of, what, rationality, consists, in, compare, if, we, find, out, how, a, computer, program, solves, problems, in, linear, algebra, we, don, t, say, it, s, not, really, solving, them, we, just, say, we, know, how, it, does, it, on, the, other, hand, in, cases, like, weizenbaum, s, eliza, program, the, explanation, of, how, the, computer, carries, on, a, conversation, is, so, simple, that, the, right, thing, to, say, seems, to, be, that, the, machine, isn, t, really, carrying, on, a, conversation, it, s, just, a, trick, skinner, s, view, of, behavior, is, most, often, characterized, as, a, molecular, view, of, behavior, that, is, behavior, can, be, decomposed, into, atomistic, parts, or, molecules, this, view, is, inconsistent, with, skinner, s, complete, description, of, behavior, as, delineated, in, other, works, including, his, 1981, article, selection, by, consequences, skinner, proposed, that, a, complete, account, of, behavior, requires, understanding, of, selection, history, at, three, levels, biology, the, natural, selection, or, phylogeny, of, the, animal, behavior, the, reinforcement, history, or, ontogeny, of, the, behavioral, repertoire, of, the, animal, and, for, some, species, culture, the, cultural, practices, of, the, social, group, to, which, the, animal, belongs, this, whole, organism, then, interacts, with, its, environment, molecular, behaviorists, use, notions, from, melioration, theory, negative, power, function, discounting, or, additive, versions, of, negative, power, function, discounting, according, to, moore, the, perseverance, in, a, molecular, examination, of, behavior, may, be, sign, of, a, desire, for, an, in, depth, understanding, maybe, to, identify, any, underlying, mechanism, or, components, that, contribute, to, comples, actions, this, strategy, might, involve, elements, procedure, or, variables, that, contribute, to, behaviorism, molar, behaviorists, such, as, howard, rachlin, richard, herrnstein, and, william, baum, argue, that, behavior, cannot, be, understood, by, focusing, on, events, in, the, moment, that, is, they, argue, that, behavior, is, best, understood, as, the, ultimate, product, of, an, organism, s, history, and, that, molecular, behaviorists, are, committing, a, fallacy, by, inventing, fictitious, proximal, causes, for, behavior, molar, behaviorists, argue, that, standard, molecular, constructs, such, as, associative, strength, are, better, replaced, by, molar, variables, such, as, rate, of, reinforcement, thus, a, molar, behaviorist, would, describe, loving, someone, as, a, pattern, of, loving, behavior, over, time, there, is, no, isolated, proximal, cause, of, loving, behavior, only, a, history, of, behaviors, of, which, the, current, behavior, might, be, an, example, that, can, be, summarized, as, love, skinner, s, radical, behaviorism, has, been, highly, successful, experimentally, revealing, new, phenomena, with, new, methods, but, skinner, s, dismissal, of, theory, limited, its, development, theoretical, behaviorism, recognized, that, a, historical, system, an, organism, has, a, state, as, well, as, sensitivity, to, stimuli, and, the, ability, to, emit, responses, indeed, skinner, himself, acknowledged, the, possibility, of, what, he, called, latent, responses, in, humans, even, though, he, neglected, to, extend, this, idea, to, rats, and, pigeons, latent, responses, constitute, a, repertoire, from, which, operant, reinforcement, can, select, theoretical, behaviorism, links, between, the, brain, and, the, behavior, that, provides, a, real, understanding, of, the, behavior, rather, than, a, mental, presumption, of, how, brain, behavior, relates, the, theoretical, concept, of, behaviorism, are, blended, with, knowledge, of, mental, structure, such, as, memory, and, expectancies, associated, with, inflexable, behaviorist, stances, that, have, traditionally, forbidden, the, examination, of, the, mental, state, because, of, its, flexibility, theoretical, behaviorism, permits, the, cognitive, process, to, have, an, impact, on, behavior, from, its, inception, behavior, analysis, has, centered, its, examination, on, cultural, occurrences, skinner, 1953, 1961, 1971, 1974, nevertheless, the, methods, used, to, tackle, these, occurrences, have, evolved, initially, culture, was, perceived, as, a, factor, influencing, behavior, later, becoming, a, subject, of, study, in, itself, this, shift, prompted, research, into, group, practices, and, the, potential, for, significant, behavioral, transformations, on, a, larger, scale, following, glenn, s, 1986, influential, work, metacontingencies, in, walden, two, numerous, research, endeavors, exploring, behavior, analysis, in, cultural, contexts, have, centered, around, the, concept, of, the, metacontingency, glenn, 2003, posited, that, understanding, the, origins, and, development, of, cultures, necessitates, delving, beyond, evolutionary, and, behavioral, principles, governing, species, characteristics, and, individual, learned, behaviors, requires, analysis, at, a, major, level, with, the, fast, growth, of, big, behavioral, data, and, applications, behavior, analysis, is, ubiquitous, understanding, behavior, from, the, informatics, and, computing, perspective, becomes, increasingly, critical, for, in, depth, understanding, of, what, why, and, how, behaviors, are, formed, interact, evolve, change, and, affect, business, and, decision, behavior, informatics, and, behavior, computing, deeply, explore, behavior, intelligence, and, behavior, insights, from, the, informatics, and, computing, perspectives, pavel, et, al, 2015, found, that, in, the, realm, of, healthcare, and, health, psychology, substantial, evidence, supports, the, notion, that, personalized, health, interventions, yield, greater, effectiveness, compared, to, standardized, approaches, additionally, researchers, found, that, recent, progress, in, sensor, and, communication, technology, coupled, with, data, analysis, and, computational, modeling, holds, significant, potential, in, revolutionizing, interventions, aimed, at, changing, health, behavior, simultaneous, advancements, in, sensor, and, communication, technology, alongside, the, field, of, data, science, have, now, made, it, possible, to, comprehensively, measure, behaviors, occurring, in, real, life, settings, these, two, elements, when, combined, with, advancements, in, computational, modeling, have, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, emerging, discipline, known, as, behavioral, informatics, behavioral, informatics, represents, a, scientific, and, engineering, domain, encompassing, behavior, tracking, evaluation, computational, modeling, deduction, and, intervention, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, behaviorism, was, largely, eclipsed, as, a, result, of, the, cognitive, revolution, this, shift, was, due, to, radical, behaviorism, being, highly, criticized, for, not, examining, mental, processes, and, this, led, to, the, development, of, the, cognitive, therapy, movement, in, the, mid, 20th, century, three, main, influences, arose, that, would, inspire, and, shape, cognitive, psychology, as, a, formal, school, of, thought, in, more, recent, years, several, scholars, have, expressed, reservations, about, the, pragmatic, tendencies, of, behaviorism, in, the, early, years, of, cognitive, psychology, behaviorist, critics, held, that, the, empiricism, it, pursued, was, incompatible, with, the, concept, of, internal, mental, states, cognitive, neuroscience, however, continues, to, gather, evidence, of, direct, correlations, between, physiological, brain, activity, and, putative, mental, states, endorsing, the, basis, for, cognitive, psychology, staddon, 1993, found, that, skinner, s, theory, presents, two, significant, deficiencies, firstly, he, downplayed, the, significance, of, processes, responsible, for, generating, novel, behaviors, which, it, is, term, as, behavioral, variation, skinner, primarily, emphasized, reinforcement, as, the, sole, determinant, for, selecting, responses, overlooking, these, critical, processes, involved, in, creating, new, behaviors, secondly, both, skinner, and, many, other, behaviorists, of, that, era, endorsed, contiguity, as, a, sufficient, process, for, response, selection, however, rescorla, and, wagner, 1972, later, demonstrated, particularly, in, classical, conditioning, that, competition, is, an, essential, complement, to, contiguity, they, showed, that, in, operant, conditioning, both, contiguity, and, competition, are, imperative, for, discerning, cause, and, effect, relationships, the, influential, rescorla, wagner, model, highlights, the, significance, of, competition, for, limited, associative, value, essential, for, assessing, predictability, a, similar, formal, argument, was, presented, by, ying, zhang, and, john, staddon, 1991, in, press, concerning, operant, conditioning, the, combination, of, contiguity, and, competition, among, action, tendencies, suffices, as, an, assignment, of, credit, mechanism, capable, of, detecting, genuine, instrumental, contingency, between, a, response, and, its, reinforcer, this, mechanism, delineates, the, limitations, of, skinner, s, idea, of, adventitious, reinforcement, revealing, its, efficacy, only, under, stringent, conditions, when, the, reinforcement, s, strengthening, effect, is, nearly, constant, across, instances, and, with, very, short, intervals, between, reinforcers, however, these, conditions, rarely, hold, in, reality, behavior, following, reinforcement, tends, to, exhibit, high, variability, and, superstitious, behavior, diminishes, with, extremely, brief, intervals, between, reinforcements, behavior, therapy, is, a, term, referring, to, different, types, of, therapies, that, treat, mental, health, disorders, it, identifies, and, helps, change, people, s, unhealthy, behaviors, or, destructive, behaviors, through, learning, theory, and, conditioning, ivan, pavlov, s, classical, conditioning, as, well, as, counterconditioning, are, the, basis, for, much, of, clinical, behavior, therapy, but, also, includes, other, techniques, including, operant, conditioning, or, contingency, management, and, modeling, sometimes, called, observational, learning, a, frequently, noted, behavior, therapy, is, systematic, desensitization, graduated, exposure, therapy, which, was, first, demonstrated, by, joseph, wolpe, and, arnold, lazarus, applied, behavior, analysis, aba, also, called, behavioral, engineering, is, a, scientific, discipline, that, applies, the, principles, of, behavior, analysis, to, change, behavior, aba, derived, from, much, earlier, research, in, the, journal, of, the, experimental, analysis, of, behavior, which, was, founded, by, b, f, skinner, and, his, colleagues, at, harvard, university, nearly, a, decade, after, the, study, the, psychiatric, nurse, as, a, behavioral, engineer, 1959, was, published, in, that, journal, which, demonstrated, how, effective, the, token, economy, was, in, reinforcing, more, adaptive, behavior, for, hospitalized, patients, with, schizophrenia, and, intellectual, disability, it, led, to, researchers, at, the, university, of, kansas, to, start, the, journal, of, applied, behavior, analysis, in, 1968, although, aba, and, behavior, modification, are, similar, behavior, change, technologies, in, that, the, learning, environment, is, modified, through, respondent, and, operant, conditioning, behavior, modification, did, not, initially, address, the, causes, of, the, behavior, particularly, the, environmental, stimuli, that, occurred, in, the, past, or, investigate, solutions, that, would, otherwise, prevent, the, behavior, from, reoccurring, as, the, evolution, of, aba, began, to, unfold, in, the, mid, 1980s, functional, behavior, assessments, fbas, were, developed, to, clarify, the, function, of, that, behavior, so, that, it, is, accurately, determined, which, differential, reinforcement, contingencies, will, be, most, effective, and, less, likely, for, aversive, punishments, to, be, administered, in, addition, methodological, behaviorism, was, the, theory, underpinning, behavior, modification, since, private, events, were, not, conceptualized, during, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, which, contrasted, from, the, radical, behaviorism, of, behavior, analysis, aba, the, term, that, replaced, behavior, modification, has, emerged, into, a, thriving, field, the, independent, development, of, behaviour, analysis, outside, the, united, states, also, continues, to, develop, in, the, us, the, american, psychological, association, apa, features, a, subdivision, for, behavior, analysis, titled, apa, division, 25, behavior, analysis, which, has, been, in, existence, since, 1964, and, the, interests, among, behavior, analysts, today, are, wide, ranging, as, indicated, in, a, review, of, the, 30, special, interest, groups, sigs, within, the, association, for, behavior, analysis, international, abai, such, interests, include, everything, from, animal, behavior, and, environmental, conservation, to, classroom, instruction, such, as, direct, instruction, and, precision, teaching, verbal, behavior, developmental, disabilities, and, autism, clinical, psychology, i, e, forensic, behavior, analysis, behavioral, medicine, i, e, behavioral, gerontology, aids, prevention, and, fitness, training, and, consumer, behavior, analysis, the, field, of, applied, animal, behavior, a, sub, discipline, of, aba, that, involves, training, animals, is, regulated, by, the, animal, behavior, society, and, those, who, practice, this, technique, are, called, applied, animal, behaviorists, research, on, applied, animal, behavior, has, been, frequently, conducted, in, the, applied, animal, behaviour, science, journal, since, its, founding, in, 1974, aba, has, also, been, particularly, well, established, in, the, area, of, developmental, disabilities, since, the, 1960s, but, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1980s, that, individuals, diagnosed, with, autism, spectrum, disorders, were, beginning, to, grow, so, rapidly, and, groundbreaking, research, was, being, published, that, parent, advocacy, groups, started, demanding, for, services, throughout, the, 1990s, which, encouraged, the, formation, of, the, behavior, analyst, certification, board, a, credentialing, program, that, certifies, professionally, trained, behavior, analysts, on, the, national, level, to, deliver, such, services, nevertheless, the, certification, is, applicable, to, all, human, services, related, to, the, rather, broad, field, of, behavior, analysis, other, than, the, treatment, for, autism, and, the, abai, currently, has, 14, accredited, ma, and, ph, d, programs, for, comprehensive, study, in, that, field, early, behavioral, interventions, ebis, based, on, aba, are, empirically, validated, for, teaching, children, with, autism, and, have, been, proven, as, such, for, over, the, past, five, decades, since, the, late, 1990s, and, throughout, the, twenty, first, century, early, aba, interventions, have, also, been, identified, as, the, treatment, of, choice, by, the, us, surgeon, general, american, academy, of, pediatrics, and, us, national, research, council, discrete, trial, training, also, called, early, intensive, behavioral, intervention, is, the, traditional, ebi, technique, implemented, for, thirty, to, forty, hours, per, week, that, instructs, a, child, to, sit, in, a, chair, imitate, fine, and, gross, motor, behaviors, as, well, as, learn, eye, contact, and, speech, which, are, taught, through, shaping, modeling, and, prompting, with, such, prompting, being, phased, out, as, the, child, begins, mastering, each, skill, when, the, child, becomes, more, verbal, from, discrete, trials, the, table, based, instructions, are, later, discontinued, and, another, ebi, procedure, known, as, incidental, teaching, is, introduced, in, the, natural, environment, by, having, the, child, ask, for, desired, items, kept, out, of, their, direct, access, as, well, as, allowing, the, child, to, choose, the, play, activities, that, will, motivate, them, to, engage, with, their, facilitators, before, teaching, the, child, how, to, interact, with, other, children, their, own, age, a, related, term, for, incidental, teaching, called, pivotal, response, treatment, prt, refers, to, ebi, procedures, that, exclusively, entail, twenty, five, hours, per, week, of, naturalistic, teaching, without, initially, using, discrete, trials, current, research, is, showing, that, there, is, a, wide, array, of, learning, styles, and, that, is, the, children, with, receptive, language, delays, who, initially, require, discrete, trials, to, acquire, speech, organizational, behavior, management, which, applies, contingency, management, procedures, to, model, and, reinforce, appropriate, work, behavior, for, employees, in, organizations, has, developed, a, particularly, strong, following, within, aba, as, evidenced, by, the, formation, of, the, obm, network, and, journal, of, organizational, behavior, management, which, was, rated, the, third, highest, impact, journal, in, applied, psychology, by, isi, jobm, rating, modern, day, clinical, behavior, analysis, has, also, witnessed, a, massive, resurgence, in, research, with, the, development, of, relational, frame, theory, rft, which, is, described, as, an, extension, of, verbal, behavior, and, a, post, skinnerian, account, of, language, and, cognition, rft, also, forms, the, empirical, basis, for, acceptance, and, commitment, therapy, a, therapeutic, approach, to, counseling, often, used, to, manage, such, conditions, as, anxiety, and, obesity, that, consists, of, acceptance, and, commitment, value, based, living, cognitive, defusion, counterconditioning, mindfulness, and, contingency, management, positive, reinforcement, another, evidence, based, counseling, technique, derived, from, rft, is, the, functional, analytic, psychotherapy, known, as, behavioral, activation, that, relies, on, the, acl, model, awareness, courage, and, love, to, reinforce, more, positive, moods, for, those, struggling, with, depression, incentive, based, contingency, management, cm, is, the, standard, of, care, for, adults, with, substance, use, disorders, it, has, also, been, shown, to, be, highly, effective, for, other, addictions, i, e, obesity, and, gambling, although, it, does, not, directly, address, the, underlying, causes, of, behavior, incentive, based, cm, is, highly, behavior, analytic, as, it, targets, the, function, of, the, client, s, motivational, behavior, by, relying, on, a, preference, assessment, which, is, an, assessment, procedure, that, allows, the, individual, to, select, the, preferred, reinforcer, in, this, case, the, monetary, value, of, the, voucher, or, the, use, of, other, incentives, such, as, prizes, another, evidence, based, cm, intervention, for, substance, abuse, is, community, reinforcement, approach, and, family, training, that, uses, fbas, and, counterconditioning, techniques, such, as, behavioral, skills, training, and, relapse, prevention, to, model, and, reinforce, healthier, lifestyle, choices, which, promote, self, management, of, abstinence, from, drugs, alcohol, or, cigarette, smoking, during, high, risk, exposure, when, engaging, with, family, members, friends, and, co, workers, while, schoolwide, positive, behavior, support, consists, of, conducting, assessments, and, a, task, analysis, plan, to, differentially, reinforce, curricular, supports, that, replace, students, disruptive, behavior, in, the, classroom, pediatric, feeding, therapy, incorporates, a, liquid, chaser, and, chin, feeder, to, shape, proper, eating, behavior, for, children, with, feeding, disorders, habit, reversal, training, an, approach, firmly, grounded, in, counterconditioning, which, uses, contingency, management, procedures, to, reinforce, alternative, behavior, is, currently, the, only, empirically, validated, approach, for, managing, tic, disorders, some, studies, on, exposure, desensitization, therapies, which, refer, to, an, array, of, interventions, based, on, the, respondent, conditioning, procedure, known, as, habituation, and, typically, infuses, counterconditioning, procedures, such, as, meditation, and, breathing, exercises, have, recently, been, published, in, behavior, analytic, journals, since, the, 1990s, as, most, other, research, is, conducted, from, a, cognitive, behavior, therapy, framework, when, based, on, a, behavior, analytic, research, standpoint, fbas, are, implemented, to, precisely, outline, how, to, employ, the, flooding, form, of, desensitization, also, called, direct, exposure, therapy, for, those, who, are, unsuccessful, in, overcoming, their, specific, phobia, through, systematic, desensitization, also, known, as, graduated, exposure, therapy, these, studies, also, reveal, that, systematic, desensitization, is, more, effective, for, children, if, used, in, conjunction, with, shaping, which, is, further, termed, contact, desensitization, but, this, comparison, has, yet, to, be, substantiated, with, adults, other, widely, published, behavior, analytic, journals, include, behavior, modification, the, behavior, analyst, journal, of, positive, behavior, interventions, journal, of, contextual, behavioral, science, the, analysis, of, verbal, behavior, behavior, and, philosophy, behavior, and, social, issues, and, the, psychological, record, cognitive, behavior, therapy, cbt, is, a, behavior, therapy, discipline, that, often, overlaps, considerably, with, the, clinical, behavior, analysis, subfield, of, aba, but, differs, in, that, it, initially, incorporates, cognitive, restructuring, and, emotional, regulation, to, alter, a, person, s, cognition, and, emotions, various, forms, of, cbt, have, been, used, to, treat, physically, experienced, symptoms, that, disrupt, individuals, livelihood, which, often, stem, from, complex, mental, health, disorders, complications, of, many, trauma, induced, disorders, result, in, lack, of, sleep, and, nightmares, with, cognitive, behavior, therapy, functioning, as, an, intervention, found, to, reduce, the, average, number, of, ptsd, patients, suffering, from, related, sleep, disturbance, a, popularly, noted, counseling, intervention, known, as, dialectical, behavior, therapy, dbt, includes, the, use, of, a, chain, analysis, as, well, as, cognitive, restructuring, emotional, regulation, distress, tolerance, counterconditioning, mindfulness, and, contingency, management, positive, reinforcement, dbt, is, quite, similar, to, acceptance, and, commitment, therapy, but, contrasts, in, that, it, derives, from, a, cbt, framework, although, dbt, is, most, widely, researched, for, and, empirically, validated, to, reduce, the, risk, of, suicide, in, psychiatric, patients, with, borderline, personality, disorder, it, can, often, be, applied, effectively, to, other, mental, health, conditions, such, as, substance, abuse, as, well, as, mood, and, eating, disorders, a, study, on, bpd, was, conducted, confirming, dbt, as, a, constructive, therapeutic, option, for, emotionally, unregulated, patients, before, dbt, participants, with, borderline, personality, disorder, were, shown, images, of, highly, emotional, people, and, neuron, activity, in, the, amygdala, was, recorded, via, fmri, after, 1, year, of, consistent, dialectical, behavior, therapy, participants, were, re, tested, with, fmri, capturing, a, decrease, in, amygdala, hyperactivity, emotional, activation, in, response, to, the, applied, stimulus, exhibiting, increases, in, emotional, regulation, capabilities, most, research, on, exposure, therapies, also, called, desensitization, ranging, from, eye, movement, desensitization, and, reprocessing, therapy, to, exposure, and, response, prevention, are, conducted, through, a, cbt, framework, in, non, behavior, analytic, journals, and, these, enhanced, exposure, therapies, are, well, established, in, the, research, literature, for, treating, phobic, post, traumatic, stress, and, other, anxiety, disorders, such, as, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, or, ocd, cognitive, based, behavioral, activation, ba, the, psychotherapeutic, approach, used, for, depression, is, shown, to, be, highly, effective, and, is, widely, used, in, clinical, practice, some, large, randomized, control, trials, have, indicated, that, cognitive, based, ba, is, as, beneficial, as, antidepressant, medications, but, more, efficacious, than, traditional, cognitive, therapy, other, commonly, used, clinical, treatments, derived, from, behavioral, learning, principles, that, are, often, implemented, through, a, cbt, model, include, community, reinforcement, approach, and, family, training, and, habit, reversal, training, for, substance, abuse, and, tics,
