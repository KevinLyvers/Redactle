a, debit, card, also, known, as, a, check, card, or, bank, card, is, a, payment, card, that, can, be, used, in, place, of, cash, to, make, purchases, the, card, usually, consists, of, the, bank, s, name, a, card, number, the, cardholder, s, name, and, an, expiration, date, on, either, the, front, or, the, back, many, new, cards, now, have, a, chip, on, them, which, allows, people, to, use, their, card, by, touch, contactless, or, by, inserting, the, card, and, keying, in, a, pin, as, with, swiping, the, magnetic, stripe, debit, cards, are, similar, to, a, credit, card, but, the, money, for, the, purchase, must, be, in, the, cardholder, s, bank, account, at, the, time, of, the, purchase, and, is, immediately, transferred, directly, from, that, account, to, the, merchant, s, account, to, pay, for, the, purchase, some, debit, cards, carry, a, stored, value, with, which, a, payment, is, made, prepaid, cards, but, most, relay, a, message, to, the, cardholder, s, bank, to, withdraw, funds, from, the, cardholder, s, designated, bank, account, in, some, cases, the, payment, card, number, is, assigned, exclusively, for, use, on, the, internet, and, there, is, no, physical, card, this, is, referred, to, as, a, virtual, card, in, many, countries, the, use, of, debit, cards, has, become, so, widespread, that, they, have, overtaken, checks, in, volume, or, have, entirely, replaced, them, in, some, instances, debit, cards, have, also, largely, replaced, cash, transactions, the, development, of, debit, cards, unlike, credit, cards, and, charge, cards, has, generally, been, country, specific, resulting, in, a, number, of, different, systems, around, the, world, that, are, often, incompatible, since, the, mid, 2000s, a, number, of, initiatives, have, allowed, debit, cards, issued, in, one, country, to, be, used, in, other, countries, and, allowed, their, use, for, internet, and, phone, purchases, debit, cards, usually, also, allow, an, instant, withdrawal, of, cash, acting, as, an, atm, card, for, this, purpose, merchants, may, also, offer, cashback, facilities, to, customers, so, that, they, can, withdraw, cash, along, with, their, purchase, there, are, usually, daily, limits, on, the, amount, of, cash, that, can, be, withdrawn, most, debit, cards, are, plastic, but, there, are, cards, made, of, metal, and, rarely, wood, there, are, currently, three, ways, that, debit, card, transactions, are, processed, eftpos, also, known, as, online, debit, or, pin, debit, offline, debit, also, known, as, signature, debit, and, the, electronic, purse, card, system, one, physical, card, can, include, the, functions, of, all, three, types, so, it, can, be, used, in, a, number, of, different, circumstances, the, five, major, debit, card, networks, are, unionpay, american, express, discover, mastercard, and, visa, other, card, networks, are, star, jcb, pulse, etc, there, are, many, types, of, debit, cards, each, accepted, only, within, a, particular, country, or, region, for, example, switch, since, merged, with, maestro, and, solo, in, the, united, kingdom, interac, in, canada, carte, bleue, in, france, ec, electronic, cash, formerly, eurocheque, in, germany, bancomat, pagobancomat, in, italy, unionpay, in, china, rupay, in, india, and, eftpos, cards, in, australia, and, new, zealand, the, need, for, cross, border, compatibility, and, the, advent, of, the, euro, recently, led, to, many, of, these, card, networks, such, as, switzerland, s, ec, direkt, austria, s, bankomatkasse, and, switch, in, the, united, kingdom, being, re, branded, with, the, internationally, recognized, maestro, logo, which, is, part, of, the, mastercard, brand, some, debit, cards, are, dual, branded, with, the, logo, of, the, former, national, card, as, well, as, maestro, for, example, ec, cards, in, germany, switch, and, solo, in, the, uk, pinpas, cards, in, the, netherlands, bancontact, cards, in, belgium, etc, the, use, of, a, debit, card, system, allows, operators, to, package, their, products, more, effectively, while, monitoring, customer, spending, online, debit, cards, require, electronic, authorization, of, every, transaction, and, the, debits, are, reflected, in, the, user, s, account, immediately, the, transaction, may, be, additionally, secured, with, the, personal, identification, number, pin, authentication, system, some, online, cards, require, such, authentication, for, every, transaction, essentially, becoming, enhanced, automatic, teller, machine, atm, cards, one, difficulty, with, using, online, debit, cards, is, the, necessity, of, an, electronic, authorization, device, at, the, point, of, sale, pos, and, sometimes, also, a, separate, pinpad, to, enter, the, pin, although, this, is, becoming, commonplace, for, all, card, transactions, in, many, countries, overall, the, online, debit, card, is, generally, viewed, as, superior, to, the, offline, debit, card, because, of, its, more, secure, authentication, system, and, live, status, which, alleviates, problems, with, processing, lag, on, transactions, that, may, only, issue, online, debit, cards, some, online, debit, systems, are, using, the, normal, authentication, processes, of, internet, banking, to, provide, real, time, online, debit, transactions, offline, debit, cards, have, the, logos, of, major, credit, cards, for, example, visa, or, mastercard, these, cards, connect, straight, to, a, person, s, bank, account, but, there, is, a, delay, before, the, money, is, taken, out, smart, card, based, electronic, purse, systems, in, which, value, is, stored, on, the, card, chip, not, in, an, externally, recorded, account, so, that, machines, accepting, the, card, need, no, network, connectivity, have, been, in, use, throughout, europe, since, the, mid, 1990s, most, notably, in, germany, geldkarte, austria, quick, wertkarte, the, netherlands, chipknip, belgium, proton, switzerland, cash, and, france, moneo, which, is, usually, carried, by, a, debit, card, in, austria, and, germany, almost, all, current, bank, cards, now, include, electronic, purses, whereas, the, electronic, purse, has, been, recently, phased, out, in, the, netherlands, prepaid, debit, cards, are, reloadable, and, can, also, be, called, reloadable, debit, cards, the, primary, market, for, prepaid, debit, cards, has, historically, been, unbanked, people, that, is, people, who, do, not, use, banks, or, credit, unions, for, their, financial, transactions, advantages, of, prepaid, debit, cards, include, being, safer, than, carrying, cash, worldwide, acceptance, not, having, to, worry, about, paying, a, credit, card, bill, or, going, into, debt, the, opportunity, for, anyone, over, the, age, of, 18, to, apply, and, be, accepted, without, checks, on, creditworthiness, and, the, option, to, deposit, paychecks, and, government, benefits, directly, onto, the, card, for, free, a, newer, advantage, is, the, use, of, emv, technology, and, even, contactless, functionality, which, had, previously, been, limited, to, bank, debit, cards, and, credit, cards, prepaid, cards, vary, by, the, issuer, company, key, and, niche, financial, players, sometimes, collaborations, between, businesses, purpose, of, usage, transit, card, beauty, gift, cards, travel, card, health, savings, card, business, insurance, etc, and, regions, as, of, 2013, several, city, governments, including, oakland, california, and, chicago, illinois, are, now, offering, prepaid, debit, cards, either, as, part, of, a, municipal, id, card, for, people, such, as, illegal, immigrants, who, are, unable, to, obtain, a, state, driver, s, license, or, dmv, id, card, in, the, case, of, oakland, or, in, conjunction, with, a, prepaid, transit, pass, in, chicago, these, cards, have, been, heavily, criticized, for, their, higher, than, average, fees, such, as, excessive, flat, fees, added, onto, every, purchase, made, with, the, card, the, u, s, federal, government, uses, prepaid, debit, cards, to, make, benefit, payments, to, people, who, do, not, have, bank, accounts, in, july, 2013, the, association, of, government, accountants, released, a, report, on, government, use, of, prepaid, cards, concluding, that, such, programs, offer, a, number, of, advantages, to, governments, and, those, who, receive, payments, on, a, prepaid, card, rather, than, by, check, the, prepaid, card, programs, benefit, payments, largely, for, the, cost, savings, they, offer, and, provide, easier, access, to, cash, for, recipients, as, well, as, increased, security, the, report, also, advises, that, governments, should, consider, replacing, any, remaining, cheque, based, payments, with, prepaid, card, programs, in, order, to, realize, substantial, savings, for, taxpayers, as, well, as, benefits, for, payees, in, january, 2016, the, uk, government, introduced, a, requirement, for, banks, to, offer, fee, free, basic, bank, accounts, for, all, which, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, prepaid, industry, including, the, departure, of, a, number, of, firms, consumer, protections, vary, depending, on, the, network, used, visa, and, mastercard, for, instance, prohibit, minimum, and, maximum, purchase, sizes, surcharges, and, arbitrary, security, procedures, on, the, part, of, merchants, merchants, are, usually, charged, higher, transaction, fees, for, credit, transactions, since, debit, network, transactions, are, less, likely, to, be, fraudulent, this, may, lead, them, to, steer, customers, toward, debit, transactions, consumers, disputing, charges, may, find, it, easier, to, do, so, with, a, credit, card, since, the, money, will, not, immediately, leave, their, control, fraudulent, charges, on, a, debit, card, can, also, cause, problems, with, a, checking, account, because, the, money, is, withdrawn, immediately, and, may, thus, result, in, an, overdraft, or, bounced, checks, in, some, cases, debit, card, issuing, banks, will, promptly, refund, any, disputed, charges, until, the, matter, can, be, settled, and, in, some, jurisdictions, the, consumer, s, liability, for, unauthorized, charges, is, the, same, for, both, debit, and, credit, cards, in, 2010, bank, of, america, announced, that, it, was, doing, away, with, overdraft, fees, for, debit, card, purchases, in, some, countries, such, as, india, and, sweden, consumer, protection, is, the, same, regardless, of, the, network, used, some, banks, set, minimum, and, maximum, purchase, sizes, mostly, for, online, only, cards, however, this, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, card, networks, but, rather, with, the, bank, s, judgment, of, the, person, s, age, and, credit, records, any, fees, that, the, customers, have, to, pay, to, the, bank, are, the, same, regardless, of, whether, the, transaction, is, conducted, as, a, credit, or, debit, transaction, so, there, is, no, advantage, for, the, customers, to, choose, one, transaction, mode, over, another, shops, may, add, surcharges, to, the, price, of, goods, or, services, in, accordance, with, laws, allowing, them, to, do, so, banks, consider, the, purchases, to, have, been, made, at, the, moment, when, the, card, was, swiped, regardless, of, when, the, purchase, settlement, was, made, regardless, of, which, transaction, type, was, used, the, purchase, may, result, in, an, overdraft, because, the, money, is, considered, to, have, left, the, account, at, the, moment, of, the, card, swipe, according, to, singapore, s, local, financial, and, banking, laws, and, regulations, all, singapore, issued, credit, and, debit, cards, with, visa, or, mastercard, swipe, magnet, strips, are, disabled, by, default, if, used, outside, of, singapore, the, whole, idea, is, to, prevent, fraudulent, activities, and, protect, the, card, holder, if, customers, want, to, use, card, swipe, magnet, strips, aboard, and, internationally, they, will, have, to, activate, and, enable, international, card, usage, debit, cards, and, secured, credit, cards, are, popular, among, college, students, who, have, not, yet, established, a, credit, history, debit, cards, may, also, be, used, by, expatriate, workers, to, send, money, home, to, their, families, holding, an, affiliated, debit, card, the, consumer, perceives, a, debit, transaction, as, occurring, in, real, time, the, money, is, withdrawn, from, their, account, immediately, after, the, authorization, request, from, the, merchant, in, many, countries, this, is, correct, for, online, debit, purchases, however, when, a, purchase, is, made, using, the, credit, offline, debit, option, the, transaction, merely, places, an, authorization, hold, on, the, customer, s, account, funds, are, not, actually, withdrawn, until, the, transaction, is, reconciled, and, hard, posted, to, the, customer, s, account, usually, a, few, days, later, this, is, in, contrast, to, a, typical, credit, card, transaction, in, which, after, a, few, days, delay, before, the, transaction, is, posted, to, the, account, there, is, a, further, period, of, maybe, a, month, before, the, consumer, makes, repayment, because, of, this, in, the, case, of, an, error, by, the, merchant, or, issuer, a, debit, transaction, may, cause, more, serious, problems, for, example, overdraft, money, not, accessible, overdrawn, account, than, a, credit, card, transaction, for, example, credit, not, accessible, due, to, being, over, one, s, credit, limit, this, is, especially, true, in, the, united, states, where, check, fraud, is, a, crime, in, every, state, but, exceeding, one, s, credit, limit, is, not, debit, cards, may, also, be, used, on, the, internet, either, with, or, without, using, a, pin, internet, transactions, may, be, conducted, in, either, online, or, offline, mode, shops, accepting, online, only, cards, are, rare, in, some, countries, such, as, sweden, while, they, are, common, in, other, countries, such, as, the, netherlands, for, a, comparison, paypal, offers, the, customer, to, use, an, online, only, maestro, card, if, the, customer, enters, a, dutch, address, of, residence, but, not, if, the, same, customer, enters, a, swedish, address, of, residence, internet, purchases, can, be, authenticated, by, the, consumer, entering, their, pin, if, the, merchant, has, enabled, a, secure, online, pin, pad, in, which, case, the, transaction, is, conducted, in, debit, mode, otherwise, transactions, may, be, conducted, in, either, credit, or, debit, mode, which, is, sometimes, but, not, always, indicated, on, the, receipt, and, this, has, nothing, to, do, with, whether, the, transaction, was, conducted, in, online, or, offline, mode, since, both, credit, and, debit, transactions, may, be, conducted, in, both, modes, in, some, countries, banks, tend, to, levy, a, small, fee, for, each, debit, card, transaction, in, other, countries, for, example, new, zealand, and, the, uk, the, merchants, bear, all, the, costs, and, customers, are, not, charged, there, are, many, people, who, routinely, use, debit, cards, for, all, transactions, no, matter, how, small, some, small, retailers, refuse, to, accept, debit, cards, for, small, transactions, where, paying, the, transaction, fee, would, absorb, the, profit, margin, on, the, sale, making, the, transaction, uneconomic, for, the, retailer, some, businesses, do, not, accept, card, payments, at, all, even, in, an, era, with, declining, use, of, cash, this, still, happens, for, a, variety, of, reasons, tax, evasion, by, small, business, included, in, 2019, 35, 000, million, in, tax, revenue, was, lost, in, the, united, kingdom, due, to, cash, only, payments, many, businesses, such, as, barber, shops, fish, chip, shops, chinese, takeaways, the, black, market, and, even, some, building, sites, are, known, for, cash, in, hand, payments, in, the, uk, meaning, high, amounts, of, money, can, be, unaccounted, for,

network, in, the, last, few, years, most, early, keycards, were, only, usable, for, eftpos, and, at, atm, or, bank, branches, whilst, the, new, debit, card, system, works, in, the, same, way, as, a, credit, card, except, it, will, only, use, funds, in, the, specified, bank, account, this, means, that, among, other, advantages, the, new, system, is, suitable, for, electronic, purchases, without,

additionally, be, authorized, using, a, contactless, payment, mechanism, requiring, a, pin, for, purchases, over, 200, if, the, user, fails, to, enter, the, correct, pin, three, times, the, consequences, range, from, the, card, being, locked, out, for, a, minimum, 24, hour, period, a, phone, call, or, trip, to, the, branch, to, reactivate, with, a, new, pin, the, card, being, cut, up,

by, the, merchant, with, no, fee, applied, to, the, end, user, although, a, direct, consumer, surcharge, of, 0, 5, 3, is, not, uncommon, while, eftpos, transactions, cost, the, consumer, an,

both, eftpos, and, credit, cards, by, the, reserve, bank, has, seen, a, continuation, in, the, increasing, ubiquity, of, credit, card, use, among, australians, and, a, general, decline, in, the, profile, of, eftpos, however, the, regulation, of, settlement, fees, also, removed, the, ability, of, banks, who, typically, provide, merchant, services, to, retailers, on, behalf, of, visa, or, mastercard, from, stopping, those, retailers, charging, extra, fees, to, take, payment, by, credit, card, instead, of, cash, or, eftpos, in, bahrain, debit, cards, are, under, benefit, the,

since, its, national, launch, in, 1994, interac, direct, payment, has, become, so, widespread, that, as, of, 2001, more, transactions, in, canada, were, completed, using, debit, cards, than, cash, this, popularity, may, be, partially, attributable, to, two, main, factors, the, convenience, of, not, having, to, carry, cash, and, the, availability, of, automated, bank, machines, abms, and, direct, payment, merchants, on, the, network, debit, cards, may, be, considered, similar, to, stored, value, cards, in, that, they, represent, a, finite, amount, of, money, owed, by, the, card, issuer, to, the, holder, they, are, different, in, that, stored, value, cards, are, generally, anonymous, and, are, only, usable, at, the, issuer, while, debit, cards, are, generally, associated,

international, transactions, and, plus, for, international, atms, since, interac, isn, t, well, supported, in, these, situations, consumers, in, canada, are, protected, under, a, voluntary, code, entered, into, by, all, providers, of, debit, card, services, the, canadian, code, of, practice, for, consumer, debit, card, services, sometimes, called, the, debit, card, code, adherence, to, the, code, is, overseen, by, the, financial, consumer, agency, of, canada, fcac, which, investigates, consumer, complaints, according, to, the, fcac, website, revisions, to, the, code, that, came, into, effect, in, 2005, put, the, onus, on, the, financial, institution, to, prove, that, a, consumer, was, responsible, for, a, disputed, transaction, and, also, place, a, limit, on, the, number, of, days, that, an, account, can, be, frozen, during, the, financial, institution, s, investigation, of, a, transaction, chile, has, an, eftpos, system, called, redcompra, purchase, network, which, is,

denmark, it, was, introduced, on, 1, september, 1983, and, despite, the, initial, transactions, being, paper, based, the, dankort, quickly, won, widespread, acceptance, by, 1985, the, first, eftpos, terminals, were, introduced, and, 1985, was, also, the, year, when, the, number, of, dankort, transactions, first, exceeded, 1, million, today, dankort, is, primarily, issued, as, a, multicard, combining, the, national, dankort, with, the, more, internationally, recognized, visa, denoted, simply, as, a, visa, dankort, card, in, september, 2008, 4, million, cards, had, been, issued, of,

a, national, standard, pankkikortti, bank, card, physically, a, pankkikortti, was, the, same, as, an, international, credit, card, and, the, same, card, imprinters, and, slips, were, used, for, pankkikortti, and, credit, cards, but, the, cards, were, not, accepted, abroad, this, has, now, been, replaced, by, the, visa, and, mastercard, debit, card, systems, and, finnish, cards, can, be, used, elsewhere, in, the, european, union, and, the, world, an, electronic, purse, system, with, a, chipped, card, was, introduced, but, did, not, gain, much, traction, signing, a, payment, offline, entails, incurring, debt, thus, offline, payment, is, not, available, to, minors, however, online, transactions, are, permitted, and, since, almost, all, stores, have, electronic, terminals, today, also, minors, can, use, debit, cards, previously, only, cash, withdrawal, from, atms, was, available, to, minors, automaattikortti, atm, card, or, visa, electron, carte, bancaire, cb, the, national, payment, scheme, in, 2008, had, 57, 5, million, cards, carrying, its, logo, and, 7, 76, billion, transactions, pos, and, atm, were, processed, through, the, e, rsb, network, 135, transactions, per, card, mostly, debit, or, deferred, debit, in, 2019, carte, bancaire, had, 71, 1, million, cards, carrying, its, logo, and, 13, 76, billion, transactions, pos, and, atm, were, processed, through, its, network, most, cb, cards, are, debit, cards, either, debit, or, deferred, debit, less, than, 10, of, cb, cards, were, credit, cards, banks, in, france, usually, charge, annual, fees, for, debit, cards, despite, card, payments, being, very, cost, efficient, for, the, banks, yet, they, do, not, charge, personal, customers, for, chequebooks, or, processing, checks, despite, cheques, being, very, costly, for, the, banks, this, imbalance, dates, from, the, unilateral, introduction, in, france, of, chip, and, pin, debit, cards, in, the, early, 1990s, when, the, cost, of, this, technology, was, much, higher, than, it, is, now, credit, cards, of, the, type, found, in, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, are, unusual, in, france, and, the, closest, equivalent, is, the, deferred, debit, card, which, operates, like, a, normal, debit, card, except, that, all, purchase, transactions, are, postponed, until, the, end, of, the, month, thereby, giving, the, customer, between, 1, and, 31, days, of, interest, free, credit, banks, can, charge, more, for, a, deferred, debit, card, most, france, debit, cards, are, branded, with, the, cb, logo, which, assures, acceptance, throughout, france, most, banks, now, issue, visa, or, mastercard, co, branded, cards, so, that, the, card, is, accepted, on, both, the, cb, and, the, visa, or, mastercard, networks, in, france, payment, cards, are, commonly, called, carte, bleue, blue, card, regardless, of, their, actual, brand, carte, bleue, was, a, card, brand, acquired, in, 2010, by, visa, which, is, not, used, anymore, until, its, purchase, the, main, characteristic, of, carte, bleue, was, to, benefit, from, its, alliance, with, visa, which, allowed, the, use, of, the, cards, on, both, networks, many, smaller, merchants, in, france, refuse, to, accept, debit, cards, for, transactions, under, a, certain, amount, because, of, the, minimum, fee, charged, by, merchants, banks, per, transaction, but, more, and, more, merchants, accept, debit, cards, for, small, amounts, due, to, the, increased, use, of, debit, cards, merchants, in, france, do, not, differentiate, between, debit, and, credit, cards, and, so, both, have, equal, acceptance, it, is, legal, in, france, to, set, a, minimum, amount, to, transactions, but, the, merchants, must, display, it, clearly, in, january, 2016, 57, 2, of, all, the, debit, cards, in, france, also, had, a, contactless, payment, chip, the, maximum, amount, per, transaction, was, originally, set, to, 20, and, the, maximum, amount, of, all, contactless, payments, per, day, is, between, 50, 100, depending, on, the, bank, the, per, transaction, limit, increased, to, 30, in, october, 2017, due, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, per, transaction, limit, increased, to, 50, in, may, 2020, to, comply, with, demands, from, the, french, government, and, the, european, banking, authority, according, to, french, law, banks, are, liable, for, any, transaction, made, with, a, copy, of, the, original, card, and, for, any, transaction, made, without, a, card, on, the, phone, or, on, the, internet, so, banks, have, to, pay, back, any, fraudulent, transaction, to, the, card, holder, if, the, previous, criteria, are, met, fighting, card, fraud, is, therefore, more, interesting, for, banks, as, a, consequence, french, banks, websites, usually, propose, an, e, card, service, electronic, bank, card, where, a, new, virtual, card, is, created, and, linked, to, a, physical, card, such, virtual, card, can, be, used, only, once, and, for, the, maximum, amount, given, by, the, card, holder, if, the, virtual, card, number, is, intercepted, or, used, to, try, to, get, a, higher, amount, than, expected, the, transaction, is, blocked, germany, has, a, dedicated, debit, card, payment, system, called, girocard, which, is, usually, co, branded, with, v, pay, or, maestro, depending, on, the, issuing, bank, in, recent, years, both, visa, debit, and, mastercard, debit, cards, are, increasingly, more, common, as, well, historically, facilities, already, existed, before, eftpos, became, popular, with, the, eurocheque, card, an, authorization, system, initially, developed, for, paper, checks, where, in, addition, to, signing, the, actual, check, customers, also, needed, to, show, the, card, alongside, the, check, as, a, security, measure, those, cards, could, also, be, used, at, atms, and, for, card, based, electronic, funds, transfer, with, pin, entry, these, are, now, the, only, functions, of, such, cards, the, eurocheque, system, along, with, the, brand, was, abandoned, in, 2002, during, the, transition, from, the, deutsche, mark, to, the, euro, as, of, 2005, most, stores, and, petrol, outlets, have, eftpos, facilities, processing, fees, are, paid, by, the, businesses, which, leads, to, some, business, owners, refusing, debit, card, payments, for, sales, totalling, less, than, a, certain, amount, usually, 5, or, 10, euro, to, avoid, the, processing, fees, many, businesses, resorted, to, using, direct, debit, which, is, then, called, electronic, direct, debit, german, elektronisches, lastschriftverfahren, abbr, elv, the, point, of, sale, terminal, reads, the, bank, sort, code, and, account, number, from, the, card, but, instead, of, handling, the, transaction, through, the, girocard, network, it, simply, prints, a, form, which, the, customer, signs, to, authorise, the, debit, note, however, this, method, also, avoids, any, verification, or, payment, guarantee, provided, by, the, network, further, customers, can, return, debit, notes, by, notifying, their, bank, without, giving, a, reason, this, means, that, the, beneficiary, bears, the, risk, of, fraud, and, illiquidity, some, business, mitigate, the, risk, by, consulting, a, proprietary, blacklist, or, by, switching, to, girocard, for, higher, transaction, amounts, around, 2000, an, electronic, purse, card, was, introduced, dubbed, geldkarte, money, card, it, makes, use, of, the, smart, card, chip, on, the, front, of, the, standard, issue, debit, card, this, chip, can, be, charged, with, up, to, 200, euro, and, is, advertised, as, a, means, of, making, medium, to, very, small, payments, even, down, to, several, euros, or, cent, payments, the, key, factor, here, is, that, no, processing, fees, are, deducted, by, banks, it, did, not, gain, the, popularity, its, inventors, had, hoped, for, as, of, 2020, several, partners, pulled, out, of, accepting, the, geldkarte, which, is, no, longer, issued, and, set, to, be, retired, altogether, in, the, near, future, see, uemoa, debit, card, usage, surged, in, greece, after, the, introduction, of, capital, controls, in, 2015, most, bank, cards, in, hong, kong, for, saving, current, accounts, are, equipped, with,

kong, only, system, and, is, widely, accepted, in, merchants, and, government, departments, however, as, unionpay, cards, are, accepted, more, widely, overseas, consumers, can, use, the, unionpay,

cards, many, hungarians, even, refer, to, their, debit, card, bet, ti, k, rtya, mistakenly, using, the, word, for, credit, card, hitelk, rtya, the, most, commonly, used, phrase, however, is, simply, bank, card, bankk, rtya, after, the, demonetization, by, current, government, in, the, december, 2016, there, has, been, a, surge, in, cashless, transactions, so, nowadays, you, could, find, card,

atm, facilities, through, mastercard, cirrus, or, visa, plus, and, sometimes, the, british, link, atm, system, their, functionality, was, similar, to, the, british, switch, card, the, system, first,

they, were, usually, processed, online, they, could, also, be, used, in, cardholder, not, present, transactions, over, the, phone, by, mail, or, on, the, internet, or, for, processing, recurring, payments, laser, also, offered, cash, back, facilities, where, customers, could, ask, retailers, where, offered, for, an, amount, of, cash, along, with, their, transaction, this, service, allowed, retailers, to, reduce, volumes, of, cash, in, tills, and, allowed, consumers, to, avoid, having, to, use, atms, laser, adopted, emv, chip, and, pin, security, in, 2002, in, common, with, other, credit, and, debit, cards, right, across, europe, in, 2005, some, banks, issued, customers, with, lasers, cards, that, were, co, branded, with, maestro, this, allowed, them, to, be, used, in, pos, terminals, overseas, internet, transactions, were, usually, restricted, to, sites, that, specifically, accepted, laser, since, 2006, irish, banks, have, progressively, replaced, laser, with, international, schemes, primarily, visa, debit, and, by, 28, february, 2014, the, laser, card, system, had, been, withdrawn, entirely, and, is, no, longer, accepted, by, retailers, the, israel, bank, card, system, is, somewhat, confusing, to, newcomers, comprising, a, blend, of, features, taken, from, different, types, of, cards, what, may, be, referred, to, as, a, credit, card, is, most, likely, to, be, a, deferred, debit, card, on, an, associated, bank, current, account, the, most, common, type, of, card, in, israel, somewhat, like, the, situation, in, france, though, the, term, debit, card, is, not, in, common, usage, cards, are, nearly, universally, called, cartis, ashrai, literally, credit, card, a, term, which, may, belie, the, card, s, characteristics, its, main, feature, may, be, a, direct, link, to, a, connected, bank, account, through, which, they, are, mostly, issued, with, the, total, value, of, the, transactions, made, on, the, card, being, debited, from, the, bank, account, in, full, on, a, regular, date, once, a, month, without, the, option, to, carry, the, balance, over, indeed, certain, types, of, transactions, such, as, online, and, or, foreign, currency, may, be, debited, directly, from, the, connected, bank, account, at, the, time, of, the, transaction, any, such, limited, credit, enjoyed, is, a, result, of, the, customer, s, assets, and, credibility, with, the, bank, and, not, granted, by, the, credit, card, company, the, card, usually, enables, immediate, atm, cash, withdrawals, balance, inquiries, as, debit, cards, do, installment, deferred, charge, interest, free, transactions, offered, by, merchants, also, applicable, in, brazil, interest, bearing, installment, plans, deferred, charge, revolving, credit, which, is, transaction, specific, at, the, point, of, sale, though, granted, by, the, issuer, hence, the, interest, and, a, variety, of, automated, upon, request, types, of, credit, schemes, including, loans, some, of, which, revolve, or, resemble, the, extended, payment, options, sometimes, offered, by, charge, cards, thus, the, true, debit, card, is, not, so, common, in, israel, though, it, has, existed, since, 1994, it, is, offered, by, two, credit, companies, in, israel, one, is, icc, short, for, israeli, credit, cards, referred, to, as, cal, an, acronym, formed, from, its, abbreviation, in, hebrew, which, issues, it, in, the, form, of, a, visa, electron, card, valid, only, in, israel, it, is, offered, mainly, through, the, israel, post, post, office, bank, which, is, not, allowed, by, regulation, to, offer, any, type, of, credit, or, through, israel, discount, bank, its, main, owner, where, it, is, branded, as, discount, money, key, card, this, branded, israel, discount, bank, branded, debit, card, also, offered, as, valid, worldwide, card, either, as, visa, electron, or, mastercard, debit, cards, the, second, more, common, debit, card, is, offered, by, the, isracard, consortium, to, its, affiliate, banks, and, is, branded, direct, it, is, valid, only, in, israel, under, its, local, private, label, brand, as, isracard, direct, which, was, known, as, electro, cheque, until, 2002, and, while, the, local, brand, isracard, is, often, viewed, as, a, mastercard, for, local, use, only, since, 2006, isracard, has, also, offered, an, international, version, branded, mastercard, direct, which, is, less, common, these, two, debit, card, brands, operate, offline, in, israel, meaning, the, transaction, operates, under, the, credit, cards, systems, debited, officially, from, the, cardholder, account,

purchases, for, tax, deductions, in, the, occasional, instance, that, a, qualifying, purchase, is, rejected, another, form, of, payment, must, be, used, a, check, or, payment, from, another, account, and, a, claim, for, reimbursement, later, in, the, more, likely, case, that, non, qualifying, items, are, accepted, the, consumer, is, technically, still, responsible, and, the, discrepancy, could, be, revealed, during, an, audit, a, small, but, growing, segment, of, the, debit, card, business, in, the, u, s, involves, access, to, tax, favored, spending, accounts, such, as, fsas, hras, and, hsas, most, of, these, debit, cards, are, for, medical, expenses, though, a, few, are, also, issued, for, dependent, care, and, transportation, expenses, traditionally, fsas, the, oldest, of, these, accounts, were, accessed, only, through, claims, for, reimbursement, after, incurring, and, often, paying, an, out, of, pocket, expense, this, often, happens, after, the, funds, have, already, been, deducted, from, the, employee, s, paycheck, fsas, are, usually, funded, by, payroll, deduction, the, only, method, permitted, by, the, internal, revenue, service, irs, to, avoid, this, double, dipping, for, medical, fsas, and, hras, is, through, accurate, and, auditable, reporting, on, the, tax, return, statements, on, the, debit, card, that, say, for, medical, uses, only, are, invalid, for, several, reasons, 1, the, merchant, and, issuing, banks, have, no, way, of, quickly, determining, whether, the, entire, purchase, qualifies, for, the, customer, s, type, of, tax, benefit, 2, the, customer, also, has, no, quick, way, of, knowing, often, has, mixed, purchases, by, necessity, or, convenience, and, can, easily, make, mistakes, 3, extra, contractual, clauses, between, the, customer, and, issuing, bank, would, cross, over, into, the, payment, processing, standards, creating, additional, confusion, for, example, if, a, customer, was, penalized, for, accidentally, purchasing, a, non, qualifying, item, it, would, undercut, the, potential, savings, advantages, of, the, account, therefore, using, the, card, exclusively, for, qualifying, purchases, may, be, convenient, for, the, customer, but, it, has, nothing, to, do, with, how, the, card, can, actually, be, used, if, the, bank, rejects, a, transaction, for, instance, because, it, is, not, at, a, recognized, drug, store, then, it, would, be, causing, harm, and, confusion, to, the, cardholder, in, the, united, states, not, all, medical, service, or, supply, stores, are, capable, of, providing, the, correct, information, so, an, fsa, debit, card, issuer, can, honor, every, transaction, if, rejected, or, documentation, is, not, deemed, enough, to, satisfy, regulations, cardholders, may, have, to, send, in, forms, manually, one, difference, between, fsas, and, hsas, is, the, matter, of, yearend, and, rollovers, fsas, began, as, per, calendar, year, although, by, 2013, rollovers, were, introduced, debit, cards, are, accepted, in, a, relatively, large, number, of, stores, both, large, and, small, in, uruguay, but, their, use, has, so, far, remained, low, as, compared, to, credit, cards, at, atms, since, august, 2014, with, the, financial, inclusion, law, coming, into, force, end, consumers, obtain, a, 4, vat, deduction, for, using, debit, cards, in, their, purchases, there, has, been, a, lack, of, cash, due, to, the, venezuelan, economic, crisis, and, thus, the, demand, for, and, use, of, debit, cards, has, increased, greatly, in, recent, years, one, reason, why, a,
