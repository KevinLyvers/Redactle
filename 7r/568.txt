under, international, law, is, responsible, therefor, and, liable, to, punishment, the, fact, that, internal, law, does, not, impose, a, penalty, for, an, act, which, constitutes, a, crime, under, international, law, does, not, relieve, the, person, who, committed, the, act, from, responsibility, under, international, law, the, fact, that, a, person, who, committed, an, act, which, constitutes, a, crime, under, international, law, acted, as, head, of, state, or, responsible, government, official, does, not, relieve, him, from, responsibility, under, international, law, the, fact, that, a, person, acted, pursuant, to, order, of, his, government, or, of, a, superior, does, not, relieve, him, from, responsibility, under, international, law, provided, a, moral, choice, was, in, fact, possible, to, him, this, principle, could, be, paraphrased, as, follows, it, is, not, an, acceptable, excuse, to, say, i, was, just, following, my, superior, s, orders, previous, to, the, time, of, the, nuremberg, trials, this, excuse, was, known, in, common, parlance, as, superior, orders, after, the, prominent, high, profile, event, of, the, nuremberg, trials, that, excuse, is, now, referred, to, by, many, as, the, nuremberg, defense, in, recent, times, a, third, term, lawful, orders, has, become, common, parlance, for, some, people, all, three, terms, are, in, use, today, and, they, all, have, slightly, different, nuances, of, meaning, depending, on, the, context, in, which, they, are, used, nuremberg, principle, iv, is, legally, supported, by, the, jurisprudence, found, in, certain, articles, in, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, which, deal, indirectly, with, conscientious, objection, it, is, also, supported, by, the, principles, found, in, paragraph, 171, of, the, handbook, on, procedures, and, criteria, for, determining, refugee, status, which, was, issued, by, the, office, of, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, unhcr, those, principles, deal, with, the, conditions, under, which, conscientious, objectors, can, apply, for, refugee, status, in, another, country, if, they, face, persecution, in, their, own, country, for, refusing, to, participate, in, an, illegal, war, any, person, charged, with, a, crime, under, international, law, has, the, right, to, a, fair, trial, on, the, facts, and, law, the, crimes, hereinafter, set, out, are, punishable, as, crimes, under, international, law, complicity, in, the, commission, of, a, crime, against, peace, a, war, crime, or, a, crime, against, humanity, as, set, forth, in, principle, vi, is, a, crime, under, international, law, in, the, period, just, prior, to, the, june, 26, 1945, signing, of, the, charter, of, the, united, nations, the, governments, participating, in, its, drafting, were, opposed, to, conferring, on, the, united, nations, legislative, power, to, enact, binding, rules, of, international, law, as, a, corollary, they, also, rejected, proposals, to, confer, on, the, general, assembly, the, power, to, impose, certain, general, conventions, on, states, by, some, form, of, majority, vote, there, was, however, strong, support, for, conferring, on, the, general, assembly, the, more, limited, powers, of, study, and, recommendation, which, led, to, the, adoption, of, article, 13, in, chapter, iv, of, the, charter, it, obliges, the, united, nations, general, assembly, to, initiate, studies, and, to, make, recommendations, that, encourage, the, progressive, development, of, international, law, and, its, codification, the, nuremberg, principles, were, developed, by, un, organs, under, that, limited, mandate, unlike, treaty, law, customary, international, law, is, not, written, to, prove, that, a, certain, rule, is, customary, one, has, to, show, that, it, is, reflected, in, state, practice, and, that, there, exists, a, conviction, in, the, international, community, that, such, practice, is, required, as, a, matter, of, law, for, example, the, nuremberg, trials, were, a, practice, of, the, international, law, of, the, nuremberg, principles, and, that, practice, was, supported, by, the, international, community, in, this, context, practice, relates, to, official, state, practice, and, therefore, includes, formal, statements, by, states, a, contrary, practice, by, some, states, is, possible, if, this, contrary, practice, is, condemned, by, other, states, then, the, rule, is, confirmed, see, also, sources, of, international, law, in, 1947, under, un, general, assembly, resolution, 177, ii, paragraph, a, the, international, law, commission, was, directed, to, formulate, the, principles, of, international, law, recognized, in, the, charter, of, the, nuremberg, tribunal, and, in, the, judgment, of, the, tribunal, in, the, course, of, the, consideration, of, this, subject, the, question, arose, as, to, whether, or, not, the, commission, should, ascertain, to, what, extent, the, principles, contained, in, the, charter, and, judgment, constituted, principles, of, international, law, the, conclusion, was, that, since, the, nuremberg, principles, had, been, affirmed, by, the, general, assembly, the, task, entrusted, to, the, commission, was, not, to, express, any, appreciation, of, these, principles, as, principles, of, international, law, but, merely, to, formulate, them, the, text, above, was, adopted, by, the, commission, at, its, second, session, the, report, of, the, commission, also, contains, commentaries, on, the, principles, see, yearbook, of, the, international, law, commission,
