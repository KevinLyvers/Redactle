on, oil, gas, and, mining, in, important, ways, as, the, world, bank, documented, in, a, recent, follow, up, report, one, area, of, particular, controversy, concerned, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, critics, point, out, that, the, management, response, weakened, a, key, recommendation, that, indigenous, peoples, and, affected, communities, should, have, to, provide, consent, for, projects, to, proceed, instead, there, would, be, consultation, following, the, eir, process, the, world, bank, issued, a, revised, policy, on, indigenous, peoples, the, world, bank, has, long, been, criticized, by, a, range, of, non, governmental, organizations, and, academics, notably, including, its, former, chief, economist, joseph, stiglitz, who, is, equally, critical, of, the, international, monetary, fund, the, us, treasury, department, and, the, us, and, other, developed, country, trade, negotiators, critics, argue, that, the, so, called, free, market, reform, policies, which, the, bank, advocates, in, many, cases, in, practice, are, often, harmful, to, economic, development, if, implemented, badly, too, quickly, shock, therapy, in, the, wrong, sequence, or, in, very, weak, uncompetitive, economies, world, bank, loan, agreements, can, also, force, procurements, of, goods, and, services, at, uncompetitive, non, free, market, prices, 5, other, critical, writers, such, as, john, perkins, label, the, international, financial, institutions, as, illegal, and, illegitimate, and, a, cog, of, coercive, american, diplomacy, in, carrying, out, financial, terrorism, in, masters, of, illusion, the, world, bank, and, the, poverty, of, nations, 1996, catherine, caufield, argues, that, the, assumptions, and, structure, of, the, world, bank, operation, ultimately, harm, developing, nations, rather, than, promote, them, caufield, first, criticizes, the, highly, homogenized, and, western, recipes, of, development, the, bank, holds, to, the, world, bank, different, nations, and, regions, are, indistinguishable, and, ready, to, receive, the, uniform, remedy, of, development, the, danger, of, this, assumption, is, that, to, attain, even, small, portions, of, success, western, approaches, to, life, are, adopted, and, traditional, economic, structures, and, values, are, abandoned, a, second, assumption, is, that, poor, countries, cannot, modernize, without, money, and, advice, from, abroad, several, intellectuals, in, developing, countries, have, argued, that, the, world, bank, is, deeply, implicated, in, contemporary, modes, of, donor, and, ngo, driven, imperialism, and, that, its, intellectual, contribution, functions, primarily, to, seek, to, blame, the, poor, for, their, condition, defenders, of, the, world, bank, contend, that, no, country, is, forced, to, borrow, its, money, the, bank, provides, both, loans, and, grants, even, the, loans, are, concessional, since, they, are, given, to, countries, that, have, no, access, to, international, capital, markets, furthermore, the, loans, both, to, poor, and, middle, income, countries, are, below, market, value, interest, rates, the, world, bank, argues, that, it, can, help, development, more, through, loans, than, grants, because, money, repaid, on, the, loans, can, then, be, lent, for, other, projects, criticism, was, also, expressed, towards, the, ifc, and, miga, and, their, way, of, evaluating, the, social, and, environmental, impact, of, their, projects, critics, state, that, even, though, ifc, and, miga, have, more, of, these, standards, than, the, world, bank, they, mostly, rely, on, private, sector, clients, to, monitor, their, implementation, and, miss, an, independent, monitoring, institution, in, this, context, this, is, why, an, extensive, review, of, the, institutions, implementation, strategy, of, social, and, environmental, standards, is, demanded, the, world, bank, was, the, subject, of, a, scandal, with, its, then, president, paul, wolfowitz, and,

who, could, go, running, to, daddy, bank, officials, also, believed, david, malpass, was, more, influential, than, then, us, treasury, secretary, steven, mnuchin, who, they, said, has, little, or, no, clue, on, things, in, april, 2018, the, us, treasury, had, changed, its, position, to, back, a, 13, billion, capital, infusion, for, the, bank, the, world, bank, s, integrity, vice, presidency, int,
