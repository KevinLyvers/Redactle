a, religious, war, or, a, war, of, religion, sometimes, also, known, as, a, holy, war, latin, sanctum, bellum, is, a, war, which, is, primarily, caused, or, justified, by, differences, in, religion, and, beliefs, in, the, modern, period, there, are, frequent, debates, over, the, extent, to, which, religious, economic, ethnic, or, other, aspects, of, a, conflict, are, predominant, in, a, given, war, the, degree, to, which, a, war, may, be, considered, religious, depends, on, many, underlying, questions, such, as, the, definition, of, religion, the, definition, of, religious, war, taking, religious, traditions, on, violence, such, as, holy, war, into, account, and, the, applicability, of, religion, to, war, as, opposed, to, other, possible, factors, answers, to, these, questions, heavily, influence, conclusions, on, how, prevalent, religious, wars, have, been, as, opposed, to, other, types, of, wars, according, to, scholars, such, as, jeffrey, burton, russell, conflicts, may, not, be, rooted, strictly, in, religion, and, instead, may, be, a, cover, for, the, underlying, secular, power, ethnic, social, political, and, economic, reasons, for, conflict, other, scholars, have, argued, that, what, is, termed, religious, wars, is, a, largely, western, dichotomy, and, a, modern, invention, from, the, past, few, centuries, arguing, that, all, wars, that, are, classed, as, religious, have, secular, economic, or, political, ramifications, in, several, conflicts, including, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, the, syrian, civil, war, and, the, wars, in, afghanistan, and, iraq, religious, elements, are, overtly, present, but, variously, described, as, fundamentalism, or, religious, extremism, depending, upon, the, observer, s, sympathies, however, studies, on, these, cases, often, conclude, that, ethnic, animosities, drive, much, of, the, conflicts, according, to, the, encyclopedia, of, wars, out, of, all, 1, 763, known, recorded, historical, conflicts, 121, or, 6, 87, had, religion, as, their, primary, cause, matthew, white, s, the, great, big, book, of, horrible, things, gives, religion, as, the, primary, cause, of, 11, of, the, world, s, 100, deadliest, atrocities, konrad, repgen, 1987, pointed, out, that, belligerents, may, have, multiple, intentions, to, wage, a, war, may, have, had, ulterior, motives, that, historians, can, no, longer, discover, and, therefore, calling, something, a, religious, war, or, war, of, succession, based, merely, on, a, motive, that, a, belligerent, may, have, had, does, not, necessarily, make, it, one, although, ulterior, motives, may, never, be, known, war, proclamations, do, provide, evidence, for, a, belligerent, s, legitimisation, of, the, war, to, the, public, repgen, therefore, concluded, wars, should, only, be, termed, in, so, far, as, at, least, one, of, the, belligerents, lays, claim, to, religion, a, religious, law, in, order, to, justify, his, warfare, and, to, substantiate, publicly, why, his, use, of, military, force, against, a, political, authority, should, be, a, bellum, iustum, philip, benedict, 2006, argued, that, repgen, s, definition, of, religious, war, was, too, narrow, because, sometimes, both, legitimisation, and, motivation, can, be, established, david, onnekink, 2013, added, that, a, religious, war, is, not, necessarily, the, same, as, a, holy, war, bellum, sacrum, after, all, it, is, perfectly, acceptable, to, suggest, that, a, worldly, prince, say, a, lutheran, prince, in, reformation, germany, engages, in, religious, warfare, using, mercenary, armies, while, a, holy, war, needs, to, be, authorised, by, a, religious, leader, and, fought, by, pious, soldiers, a, religious, war, does, not, he, reasoned, his, definition, of, war, of, religion, thus, became, a, war, legitimised, by, religion, and, or, for, religious, ends, but, possibly, fought, by, secular, leaders, and, soldiers, some, commentators, have, questioned, the, applicability, of, religion, to, war, in, part, because, the, word, religion, itself, is, difficult, to, define, particularly, posing, challenges, when, one, tries, to, apply, it, to, non, western, cultures, secondly, it, has, been, argued, that, religion, is, difficult, to, isolate, as, a, factor, and, is, often, just, one, of, many, factors, driving, a, war, for, example, many, armed, conflicts, may, be, simultaneously, wars, of, succession, as, well, as, wars, of, religion, when, two, rival, claimants, to, a, throne, also, represent, opposing, religions, examples, include, the, war, of, the, three, henrys, and, the, succession, of, henry, iv, of, france, during, the, french, wars, of, religion, the, hessian, war, and, the, war, of, the, j, lich, succession, during, the, reformation, in, germany, and, the, jacobite, risings, including, the, williamite, jacobite, wars, during, the, reformation, in, great, britain, and, ireland, john, morreall, and, tamara, sonn, 2013, have, argued, that, since, there, is, no, consensus, on, definitions, of, religion, among, scholars, and, no, way, to, isolate, religion, from, the, rest, of, the, more, likely, motivational, dimensions, social, political, and, economic, it, is, incorrect, to, label, any, violent, event, as, religious, theologian, william, t, cavanaugh, in, his, myth, of, religious, violence, 2009, argues, that, the, very, concept, of, religion, is, a, modern, western, concept, that, was, invented, recently, in, history, as, such, he, argues, that, the, concept, of, religious, violence, or, religious, wars, are, incorrectly, used, to, anachronistically, label, people, and, conflicts, as, participants, in, religious, ideologies, that, never, existed, in, the, first, place, the, concept, of, religion, as, an, abstraction, which, entails, distinct, sets, of, beliefs, or, doctrines, is, a, recently, invented, concept, in, the, english, language, since, such, usage, began, with, texts, from, the, 17th, century, due, to, the, splitting, of, christendom, during, the, protestant, reformation, and, more, prevalent, colonization, or, globalization, in, the, age, of, exploration, which, involved, contact, with, numerous, foreign, and, indigenous, cultures, with, non, european, languages, it, was, in, the, 17th, century, that, the, concept, of, religion, received, its, modern, shape, despite, the, fact, that, the, bible, the, quran, and, other, ancient, sacred, texts, did, not, have, a, concept, of, religion, in, the, original, languages, and, neither, did, the, people, or, the, cultures, in, which, these, sacred, texts, were, written, the, modern, word, religion, comes, from, the, latin, word, religio, which, in, the, ancient, and, medieval, world, was, understood, as, an, individual, virtue, of, worship, never, as, doctrine, practice, or, actual, source, of, knowledge, cavanaugh, argued, that, all, wars, that, are, classed, as, religious, have, secular, economic, or, political, ramifications, similar, opinions, were, expressed, as, early, as, the, 1760s, during, the, seven, years, war, widely, recognized, to, be, religious, in, motivation, noting, that, the, warring, factions, were, not, necessarily, split, along, confessional, lines, as, much, as, along, secular, interests, there, is, no, precise, equivalent, of, religion, in, hebrew, and, there, is, no, clear, definition, of, jewishness, it, could, be, defined, by, religion, roots, of, national, origin, and, ethnic, jewishness, could, have, been, multi, racial, in, the, quran, the, arabic, word, deen, is, often, translated, as, religion, in, modern, translations, but, up, to, the, mid, 17th, century, translators, expressed, deen, as, law, it, was, in, the, 19th, century, that, the, terms, buddhism, hinduism, taoism, and, confucianism, first, emerged, throughout, its, long, history, japan, had, no, concept, of, religion, since, there, was, no, corresponding, japanese, word, nor, anything, close, to, its, meaning, but, when, american, warships, appeared, off, the, coast, of, japan, in, 1853, and, forced, the, japanese, government, to, sign, treaties, demanding, among, other, things, freedom, of, religion, the, country, had, to, contend, with, this, western, idea, according, to, the, philologist, max, m, ller, what, is, called, ancient, religion, today, would, have, only, been, understood, as, law, by, the, people, in, the, ancient, world, in, sanskrit, word, dharma, sometimes, translated, as, religion, also, means, law, throughout, the, classical, indian, subcontinent, the, study, of, law, consisted, of, concepts, such, as, penance, through, piety, and, ceremonial, as, well, as, practical, traditions, medieval, japan, at, first, had, a, similar, union, between, imperial, law, and, universal, or, buddha, law, but, these, later, became, independent, sources, of, power, according, to, mcgarry, o, leary, 1995, it, is, evident, that, religion, as, one, aspect, of, a, people, s, cultural, heritage, may, serve, as, a, cultural, marker, or, ideological, rationalization, for, a, conflict, that, has, deeper, ethnic, and, cultural, differences, they, argued, this, specifically, in, the, case, of, the, troubles, in, northern, ireland, often, portrayed, as, a, religious, conflict, of, a, catholic, vs, a, protestant, faction, while, the, more, fundamental, cause, of, the, conflict, was, supposedly, ethnic, or, nationalistic, rather, than, religious, in, nature, since, the, native, irish, were, mostly, catholic, and, the, later, british, sponsored, immigrants, were, mainly, protestant, the, terms, become, shorthand, for, the, two, cultures, but, mcgarry, o, leary, argued, that, it, would, be, inaccurate, to, describe, the, conflict, as, a, religious, one, in, their, 2015, review, of, violence, and, peacemaking, in, world, religions, irfan, omar, and, michael, duffey, stated, this, book, does, not, ignore, violence, committed, in, the, name, of, religion, analyses, of, case, studies, of, seeming, religious, violence, often, conclude, that, ethnic, animosities, strongly, drive, violence, the, definition, of, religious, war, and, the, applicability, of, religion, to, war, have, a, strong, influence, on, how, many, wars, may, be, properly, labelled, religious, wars, and, thus, how, prevalent, religious, wars, have, been, as, opposed, to, other, wars, according, to, kalevi, holsti, 1991, p, 308, table, 12, 2, who, catalogued, and, categorised, wars, from, 1648, to, 1989, into, 24, categories, of, issues, that, generated, wars, protect, religious, confr, res, co, religionists, was, one, of, the, primary, cause, s, of, 14, of, all, wars, during, 1648, 1714, 11, during, 1715, 1814, 10, during, 1815, 1914, and, 0, during, 1918, 1941, and, 1945, 1989, additionally, he, found, ethnic, religious, unification, irredenta, to, be, one, of, the, primary, cause, s, of, 0, of, all, wars, during, 1648, 1714, and, 1715, 1814, 6, during, 1815, 1914, 17, during, 1918, 1941, and, 12, during, 1945, 1989, in, their, 1997, encyclopedia, of, wars, authors, charles, phillips, and, alan, axelrod, documented, 1763, notable, wars, in, world, history, out, of, which, 121, wars, were, in, the, religious, wars, category, in, the, index, they, note, that, before, the, 17th, century, much, of, the, reasons, for, conflicts, were, explained, through, the, lens, of, religion, and, that, after, that, time, wars, were, explained, through, the, lens, of, wars, as, a, way, to, further, sovereign, interests, some, commentators, have, concluded, that, only, 123, wars, 7, out, of, these, 1763, wars, were, fundamentally, originated, by, religious, motivations, andrew, holt, 2018, traced, the, origin, of, the, only, 123, religious, wars, claim, back, to, the, 2008, book, the, irrational, atheist, of, far, right, activist, vox, day, which, he, notes, is, slightly, adjusted, compared, to, the, 121, that, is, indeed, found, in, the, encyclopedia, of, wars, itself, the, encyclopedia, of, war, edited, by, gordon, martel, using, the, criteria, that, the, armed, conflict, must, involve, some, overt, religious, action, concludes, that, 6, of, the, wars, listed, in, their, encyclopedia, can, be, labelled, religious, wars, while, early, empires, could, be, described, as, henotheistic, i, e, dominated, by, a, single, god, of, the, ruling, elite, as, marduk, in, the, babylonian, empire, assur, in, the, assyrian, empire, etc, or, more, directly, by, deifying, the, ruler, in, an, imperial, cult, the, concept, of, holy, war, enters, a, new, phase, with, the, development, of, monotheism, during, classical, antiquity, the, greco, roman, world, had, a, pantheon, with, particular, attributes, and, interest, areas, ares, personified, war, while, he, received, occasional, sacrifice, from, armies, going, to, war, there, was, only, a, very, limited, cult, of, ares, in, sparta, however, each, company, of, youths, sacrificed, to, enyalios, before, engaging, in, ritual, fighting, at, the, phoebaeum, hans, m, barstad, 2008, claimed, that, this, ancient, greek, attitude, to, war, and, religion, differed, from, that, of, ancient, israel, and, judah, quite, unlike, what, we, find, with, the, greeks, holy, war, permeated, ancient, israelite, society, moreover, ever, since, the, pioneering, study, of, manfred, weippert, heiliger, krieg, in, israel, und, assyrien, 1972, scholars, have, been, comparing, the, holy, war, concept, in, the, monotheistic, hebrew, bible, with, other, polytheistic, ancient, near, eastern, war, traditions, and, found, many, similarities, in, phraseology, and, ideology, according, to, historian, edward, peters, before, the, 11th, century, christians, had, not, developed, a, concept, of, holy, war, bellum, sacrum, whereby, fighting, itself, might, be, considered, a, penitential, and, spiritually, meritorious, act, during, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, multiple, invasions, occurred, which, led, some, regions, to, make, their, own, armies, to, defend, themselves, and, this, slowly, lead, to, the, emergence, of, the, crusades, the, concept, of, holy, war, and, terminology, such, as, enemies, of, god, in, the, 11th, century, in, early, christianity, st, augustine, s, concept, of, just, war, bellum, iustum, was, widely, accepted, but, warfare, was, not, regarded, as, a, virtuous, activity, and, expressions, of, concern, for, the, salvation, of, those, who, killed, enemies, in, battle, regardless, of, the, cause, for, which, they, fought, was, common, during, the, era, of, the, crusades, some, of, the, crusaders, who, fought, in, the, name, of, god, were, recognized, as, the, milites, christi, the, soldiers, or, the, knights, of, christ, the, crusades, were, a, series, of, military, campaigns, against, the, muslim, conquests, that, were, waged, from, the, end, of, the, 11th, century, through, the, 13th, century, originally, the, goal, of, the, crusaders, was, the, recapture, of, jerusalem, and, the, holy, land, from, the, muslims, and, the, provision, of, support, to, the, besieged, christian, byzantine, empire, which, was, waging, a, war, against, muslim, seljuq, expansion, into, asia, minor, and, europe, proper, later, crusades, were, launched, against, other, targets, either, for, religious, reasons, such, as, the, albigensian, crusade, the, northern, crusades, or, because, of, political, conflicts, such, as, the, aragonese, crusade, in, 1095, at, the, council, of, clermont, pope, urban, ii, raised, the, level, of, the, war, from, a, bellum, iustum, a, just, war, to, a, bellum, sacrum, a, holy, war, this, does, not, refer, to, religious, conflict, dharma, yuddha, in, hindu, texts, refers, to, the, protocol, to, be, followed, by, both, parties, at, war, it, sets, the, rules, for, both, sides, to, conduct, the, war, fairly, jus, in, bello, it, is, important, in, vedic, and, epic, literature, such, as, the, mahabharata, and, the, ramayana, the, word, dharma, may, be, interpreted, variously, as, righteousness, or, responsibility, or, duty, based, on, the, context, neither, the, mahabharata, nor, the, ramayana, were, religious, conflicts, the, mahabharata, was, fought, over, the, inheritance, of, the, kingdom, of, hastinapura, ramayana, was, fought, over, the, abduction, of, rama, s, wife, sita, by, ravana, the, two, epics, are, of, great, importance, in, hindu, tradition, however, according, to, torkel, berkke, the, mahabharata, does, not, provide, a, clear, discussion, on, who, has, the, authority, to, initiate, a, war, jus, ad, bellum, nor, on, what, makes, a, war, just, bellum, justum, the, muslim, conquests, were, a, military, expansion, on, an, unprecedented, scale, beginning, in, the, lifetime, of, muhammad, and, spanning, the, centuries, down, to, the, ottoman, wars, in, europe, until, the, 13th, century, the, muslim, conquests, were, those, of, a, more, or, less, coherent, empire, the, caliphate, but, after, the, mongol, invasions, expansion, continued, on, all, fronts, other, than, iberia, which, was, lost, in, the, reconquista, for, another, half, millennium, until, the, final, collapse, of, the, mughal, empire, in, the, east, and, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, west, with, the, onset, of, the, modern, period, there, were, also, a, number, of, periods, of, infighting, among, muslims, these, are, known, by, the, term, fitna, and, mostly, concern, the, early, period, of, islam, from, the, 7th, to, 11th, centuries, i, e, before, the, collapse, of, the, caliphate, and, the, emergence, of, the, various, later, islamic, empires, while, technically, the, millennium, of, muslim, conquests, could, be, classified, as, religious, war, the, applicability, of, the, term, has, been, questioned, the, reason, is, that, the, very, notion, of, a, religious, war, as, opposed, to, a, secular, war, is, the, result, of, the, western, concept, of, the, separation, of, church, and, state, no, such, division, has, ever, existed, in, the, islamic, world, and, consequently, there, cannot, be, a, real, division, between, wars, that, are, religious, from, such, that, are, non, religious, islam, does, not, have, any, normative, tradition, of, pacifism, and, warfare, has, been, integral, part, of, islamic, history, both, for, the, defense, and, the, spread, of, the, faith, since, the, time, of, muhammad, this, was, formalised, in, the, juristic, definition, of, war, in, islam, which, continues, to, hold, normative, power, in, contemporary, islam, inextricably, linking, political, and, religious, justification, of, war, this, normative, concept, is, known, as, jihad, an, arabic, word, with, the, meaning, to, strive, to, struggle, viz, in, the, way, of, god, which, includes, the, aspect, of, struggle, by, the, sword, the, first, forms, of, military, jihad, occurred, after, the, migration, hijra, of, muhammad, and, his, small, group, of, followers, to, medina, from, mecca, and, the, conversion, of, several, inhabitants, of, the, city, to, islam, the, first, revelation, concerning, the, struggle, against, the, meccans, was, quran, 22, 39, 40, permission, to, fight, back, is, hereby, granted, to, those, being, fought, for, they, have, been, wronged, and, allah, is, truly, most, capable, of, helping, them, prevail, they, are, those, who, have, been, expelled, from, their, homes, for, no, reason, other, than, proclaiming, our, lord, is, allah, had, allah, not, repelled, the, aggression, of, some, people, by, means, of, others, destruction, would, have, surely, claimed, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and, mosques, in, which, allah, s, name, is, often, mentioned, allah, will, certainly, help, those, who, stand, up, for, him, allah, is, truly, all, powerful, almighty, this, happened, many, times, throughout, history, beginning, with, muhammad, s, battles, against, the, polytheist, arabs, including, the, battle, of, badr, 624, and, battles, in, uhud, 625, khandaq, 627, mecca, 630, and, hunayn, 630, reuven, firestone, 2012, stated, that, holy, war, is, a, common, theme, in, the, hebrew, bible, divinely, legitimized, through, the, authority, of, biblical, scripture, and, its, interpretation, holy, war, became, a, historical, reality, for, the, jews, of, antiquity, among, at, least, some, of, the, jewish, groups, of, the, late, second, temple, period, until, the, middle, of, the, second, century, c, e, holy, war, was, an, operative, institution, that, is, jews, engaged, in, what, is, defined, here, as, holy, war, he, mentioned, the, maccabean, revolt, 167, 160, bce, the, first, jewish, roman, war, 66, 73, ce, and, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, 132, 136, ce, as, three, examples, of, a, holy, war, or, commanded, war, hebrew, milkhemet, mitzvah, in, the, eyes, of, rabbinic, judaism, at, the, time, he, asserted, that, this, concept, may, have, re, emerged, in, modern, times, within, some, factions, of, the, zionist, movement, particularly, revisionist, zionism, in, 2016, however, firestone, made, a, distinction, between, what, he, regarded, as, the, hebrew, bible, s, concept, and, the, western, concept, of, holy, war, holy, war, is, a, western, concept, referring, to, war, that, is, fought, for, religion, against, adherents, of, other, religions, often, in, order, to, promote, religion, through, conversion, and, with, no, specific, geographic, limitation, this, concept, does, not, occur, in, the, hebrew, bible, whose, wars, are, not, fought, for, religion, or, in, order, to, promote, it, but, rather, in, order, to, preserve, religion, and, a, religiously, unique, people, in, relation, to, a, specific, and, limited, geography, several, scholars, regard, war, narratives, in, the, hebrew, bible, such, as, the, war, against, the, midianites, in, numbers, 31, to, be, a, holy, war, with, niditch, 1995, asserting, the, presence, of, a, priestly, ideology, of, war, in, numbers, 31, hamilton, 2005, argued, that, the, two, major, concerns, of, number, 31, are, the, idea, that, war, is, a, defiling, activity, but, israelite, soldiers, need, to, be, ritually, pure, so, they, may, only, fight, wars, for, a, holy, cause, and, are, required, to, cleanse, themselves, afterwards, to, restore, their, ritual, purity, the, israelite, campaign, against, midian, was, blessed, by, the, israelite, god, yahweh, and, could, therefore, be, considered, a, holy, war, olson, 2012, who, believed, the, war, narrative, to, be, a, fictional, story, with, a, theological, purpose, noted, that, the, israelite, soldiers, actions, in, numbers, 31, closely, followed, the, holy, war, regulations, set, out, in, deuteronomy, 20, 14, although, moses, commandment, to, also, kill, the, captive, male, children, and, non, virgin, women, was, a, marked, departure, from, these, regulations, he, concluded, many, aspects, of, this, holy, war, text, may, be, troublesome, to, a, contemporary, reader, but, understood, within, the, symbolic, world, of, the, ancient, writers, of, numbers, the, story, of, the, war, against, the, midianites, is, a, kind, of, dress, rehearsal, that, builds, confidence, and, hope, in, anticipation, of, the, actual, conquest, of, canaan, that, lay, ahead, dawn, 2016, translating, rad, 1958, stated, from, the, earliest, days, of, israel, s, existence, as, a, people, holy, war, was, a, sacred, institution, undertaken, as, a, cultic, act, of, a, religious, community, other, wars, known, to, judaism, include, a, mandatory, war, and, a, voluntary, war, in, greek, antiquity, four, or, five, wars, were, fought, in, and, around, the, panhellenic, sanctuary, at, delphi, the, pythia, oracle, residing, in, the, temple, of, apollo, against, persons, or, states, who, allegedly, committed, sacrilegious, acts, before, the, god, apollo, the, following, are, distinguished, firestone, 2012, stated, that, in, the, eyes, of, ancient, rabbinic, judaism, the, maccabean, revolt, 167, 160, bce, the, first, jewish, roman, war, 66, 73, ce, and, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, 132, 136, ce, were, holy, wars, or, commanded, wars, hebrew, milkhemet, mitzvah, never, was, there, a, war, more, prolonged, nor, more, cruel, than, this, nor, one, that, required, greater, efforts, on, the, part, of, the, frankish, people, for, the, saxons, are, by, nature, fierce, devoted, to, the, worship, of, demons, and, hostile, to, our, religion, and, they, think, it, no, dishonour, to, confound, and, transgress, the, laws, of, god, and, man, on, both, sides, of, the, frontier, murder, robbery, and, arson, were, of, constant, occurrence, so, the, franks, declared, open, war, against, them, einhard, on, the, origins, of, the, saxon, wars, in, vita, karoli, magni, c, 820, according, to, gregory,

war, with, the, arian, visigoths, clovis, reportedly, said, i, take, it, very, hard, that, these, arians, hold, part, of, the, gauls, let, us, go, with, god, s, help, and, conquer, them, and, bring, the, land, under, our, control, the, saxon, wars, 772, 804, of, frankish, king, charlemagne, against, the, saxons, under, widukind, were, described, by, jim, bradbury, 2004, as, in, essence, a, frontier, struggle, and, a, religious, war, against, pagans, devil, worshippers, according, to, einhard, he, noted, that, charlemagne, ordered, the, destruction, of, the, irminsul, an, object, sacred, to, the, saxons, per, ullidtz, 2014, stated, that, previous, frankish, saxon, conflicts, spanning, almost, a, century, had, been, mostly, a, border, war, but, under, charles, it, changed, character, because, of, charles, idea, of, unity, of, a, king, over, all, german, tribes, and, of, universal, christianity, in, all, of, his, kingdom, it, changed, into, a, mission, from, heaven, similarly, a, successful, carolingian, campaign, against, the, pannonian, avars, in, the, 790s, led, to, their, forced, conversion, to, christianity, the, earlier, merovingian, conquests, of, thuringia, allemannia, and, bavaria, had, also, resulted, in, their, christianisation, by, 555, although, the, frisians, resisted, with, similar, determinacy, as, the, saxons, during, the, frisian, frankish, wars, 7th, and, 8th, century, with, both, tribes, killing, several, christian, missionaries, in, defence, of, their, germanic, paganism, to, the, horror, of, christian, hagiographers, the, crusades, are, a, prime, example, of, wars, whose, religious, elements, have, been, extensively, debated, for, centuries, with, some, groups, of, people, in, some, periods, emphasising, restoring, or, overstating, the, religious, aspects, and, other, groups, of, people, in, some, periods, denying, nuancing, or, downplaying, the, religious, aspects, of, the, crusades, in, favour, of, other, factors, winkler, prins, encarta, 2002, concluded, the, traditional, explanation, for, the, crusades, a, religious, enthusiasm, that, found, an, outlet, in, a, holy, war, has, also, retained, its, value, in, modern, historical, scholarship, keeping, in, mind, the, fact, that, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, a, complex, set, of, socio, economic, and, political, factors, allowed, this, enthusiasm, to, manifest, itself, the, crusades, against, muslim, expansion, in, the, 11th, century, were, recognized, as, a, holy, war, or, a, bellum, sacrum, by, later, writers, in, the, 17th, century, the, early, modern, wars, against, the, ottoman, empire, were, seen, as, a, seamless, continuation, of, this, conflict, by, contemporaries, jim, bradbury, 2004, noted, that, the, belligerents, in, the, reconquista, were, not, all, equally, motivated, by, religion, and, that, a, distinction, should, be, made, between, secular, rulers, on, the, one, hand, and, on, the, other, hand, christian, military, orders, which, came, from, elsewhere, including, the, three, main, orders, of, knights, templar, knights, hospitaller, and, teutonic, knights, or, were, established, inside, iberia, such, as, those, of, santiago, alc, ntara, and, calatrava, were, more, committed, to, religious, war, than, some, of, their, secular, counterparts, were, opposed, to, treating, with, muslims, and, carried, out, raids, and, even, atrocities, such, as, decapitating, muslim, prisoners, the, battle, of, las, navas, de, tolosa, known, in, arab, history, as, the, battle, of, al, uqab, was, fought, on, 16, july, 1212, and, it, was, an, important, turning, point, in, both, the, reconquista, and, the, medieval, history, of, spain, the, forces, of, king, alfonso, viii, of, castile, were, joined, by, the, armies, of, his, christian, rivals, sancho, vii, of, navarre, pedro, ii, of, aragon, and, afonso, ii, of, portugal, in, battle, against, the, berber, muslim, almohad, conquerors, of, the, southern, half, of, the, iberian, peninsula, the, relative, importance, of, the, various, factors, that, caused, the, hussite, wars, 1419, 1434, is, debated, kokkonen, sundell, 2017, claimed, that, the, death, of, king, wenceslaus, iv, of, bohemia, on, 19, august, 1419, is, the, event, that, sparked, the, hussite, rebellion, against, his, nominal, heir, sigismund, then, king, of, germany, hungary, and, croatia, making, it, essentially, a, war, of, succession, nolan, 2006, named, religion, as, one, of, several, significant, causes, summarising, the, hussites, motives, as, doctrinal, as, well, as, nationalistic, and, constitutional, and, providing, a, series, of, issues, that, led, to, war, the, trial, and, execution, of, jan, hus, 1415, provoked, the, conflict, the, defenestration, of, prague, 30, july, 1419, began, the, conflict, while, fighting, began, after, king, wenceslaus, died, shortly, after, the, defenestration, that, is, after, 19, august, 1419, nolan, described, the, wars, goals, and, character, as, follows, the, main, aim, of, the, hussites, was, to, prevent, the, hated, sigismund, mounting, the, throne, of, bohemia, but, fighting, between, bohemian, hussites, and, catholics, spread, into, moravia, cross, class, support, gave, the, hussite, wars, a, tripartite, and, even, national, character, unusual, for, the, age, and, a, religious, and, social, unity, of, purpose, faith, and, hate, winkler, prins, encarta, 2002, described, the, hussites, as, a, movement, which, developed, from, a, religious, denomination, to, a, nationalist, faction, opposed, to, german, and, papal, influence, in, the, bloody, hussite, wars, 1419, 1438, they, managed, to, resist, it, did, not, mention, the, succession, of, wenceslaus, by, sigismund, but, noted, elsewhere, that, it, was, sigismund, s, policy, of, catholic, church, unity, which, prompted, him, to, urge, antipope, john, xxiii, to, convene, the, council, of, constance, in, 1414, which, ultimately, condemned, jan, hus, buddhism, was, formally, introduced, into, japan, by, missionaries, from, the, kingdom, of, baekje, in, 552, adherents, of, the, native, shinto, religion, resisted, the, spread, of, buddhism, and, several, military, conflicts, broke, out, starting, with, the, soga, mononobe, conflict, 552, 587, between, the, pro, shinto, mononobe, clan, and, nakatomi, clan, and, the, pro, buddhist, soga, clan, although, the, political, power, each, of, the, clans, could, wield, over, the, royal, family, was, also, an, important, factor, and, was, arguably, a, strategic, reason, for, the, soga, to, adopt, and, promote, buddhism, as, a, means, to, increase, their, authority, the, religious, beliefs, from, both, doctrines, as, well, as, religious, explanations, from, events, that, happened, after, the, arrival, of, buddhism, were, also, causes, of, the, conflict, that, escalated, to, war, whereas, the, soga, argued, that, buddhism, was, a, better, religion, because, it, had, come, from, china, and, korea, whose, civilisations, were, widely, regarded, as, superior, and, to, be, emulated, in, yamato, the, central, kingdom, of, japan, the, mononobe, and, nakatomi, maintained, that, there, should, be, continuity, of, tradition, and, that, worshipping, the, native, gods, kami, was, in, the, best, interest, of, the, japanese, unable, to, reach, a, decision, emperor, kinmei, r, 539, 571, maintained, shinto, as, the, royal, religion, but, allowed, the, soga, to, erect, a, temple, for, the, statue, of, buddha, afterwards, an, epidemic, broke, out, which, shintoists, attributed, to, the, anger, of, the, native, gods, to, the, intrusion, of, buddhism, in, reaction, some, burnt, down, the, buddhist, temple, and, threw, the, buddha, statue, into, a, canal, however, the, epidemic, worsened, which, buddhists, in, turn, interpreted, as, the, anger, of, buddha, to, the, sacrilege, committed, against, his, temple, and, statue, both, during, the, 585, and, 587, wars, of, succession, the, opposing, camps, were, drawn, along, the, shinto, buddhist, divide, and, the, soga, clan, s, victory, resulted, in, the, imposition, of, buddhism, as, the, yamato, court, religion, under, the, regency, of, prince, shotoku, there, have, been, several, religious, wars, in, the, toltec, empire, of, mesoamerica, c, 980, 1110, between, devotees, of, tezcatlipoca, and, followers, of, quetzalcoatl, the, latter, lost, and, were, driven, to, flee, to, the, yucat, n, peninsula, the, term, religious, war, was, used, to, describe, controversially, at, the, time, what, are, now, known, as, the, european, wars, of, religion, and, especially, the, then, ongoing, seven, years, war, from, at, least, the, mid, 18th, century, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, maintains, that, wars, of, religion, of, this, period, fought, mainly, for, confessional, security, and, political, gain, in, 16th, century, france, there, was, a, series, of, wars, between, catholics, and, protestants, huguenots, primarily, known, as, the, french, wars, of, religion, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, german, states, scandinavia, sweden, primarily, and, poland, were, beset, by, religious, warfare, during, the, thirty, years, war, catholicism, and, protestantism, figured, on, the, opposing, sides, of, this, conflict, though, catholic, france, took, the, side, of, the, protestants, but, it, did, so, for, purely, political, reasons, in, the, late, 20th, century, a, number, of, revisionist, historians, such, as, william, m, lamont, regarded, the, english, civil, war, 1642, 1651, as, a, religious, war, with, john, morrill, 1993, stating, the, english, civil, war, was, not, the, first, european, revolution, it, was, the, last, of, the, wars, of, religion, this, view, has, been, criticised, by, various, pre, post, and, anti, revisionist, historians, glen, burgess, 1998, examined, political, propaganda, written, by, the, parliamentarian, politicians, and, clerics, at, the, time, noting, that, many, were, or, may, have, been, motivated, by, their, puritan, religious, beliefs, to, support, the, war, against, the, catholic, king, charles, i, of, england, but, tried, to, express, and, legitimise, their, opposition, and, rebellion, in, terms, of, a, legal, revolt, against, a, monarch, who, had, violated, crucial, constitutional, principles, and, thus, had, to, be, overthrown, they, even, warned, their, parliamentarian, allies, to, not, make, overt, use, of, religious, arguments, in, making, their, case, for, war, against, the, king, however, in, some, cases, it, may, be, argued, that, they, hid, their, pro, anglican, and, anti, catholic, motives, behind, legal, parlance, for, example, by, emphasising, that, the, church, of, england, was, the, legally, established, religion, seen, in, this, light, the, defenses, of, parliament, s, war, with, their, apparent, legal, constitutional, thrust, are, not, at, all, ways, of, saying, that, the, struggle, was, not, religious, on, the, contrary, they, are, ways, of, saying, that, it, was, burgess, concluded, he, civil, war, left, behind, it, just, the, sort, of, evidence, that, we, could, reasonably, expect, a, war, of, religion, to, leave, the, ethiopian, adal, war, 1529, 1543, was, a, military, conflict, between, the, abyssinians, and, the, adal, sultanate, the, imam, ahmad, ibn, ibrahim, al, ghazi, came, close, to, extinguishing, the, ancient, realm, of, abyssinia, and, forcibly, converting, all, of, its, surviving, subjects, to, islam, the, intervention, of, the, european, crist, v, o, da, gama, attempted, to, help, to, prevent, this, outcome, but, he, was, killed, by, al, ghazi, however, both, polities, exhausted, their, resources, and, manpower, in, this, conflict, allowing, the, northward, migration, of, the, oromo, into, their, present, homelands, to, the, north, and, west, of, addis, ababa, many, historians, trace, the, origins, of, hostility, between, somalia, and, ethiopia, to, this, war, the, greek, war, of, independence, 1821, 1829, has, sometimes, been, considered, a, religious, war, between, christians, and, muslims, especially, in, its, early, phase, the, greek, declaration, of, independence, issued, on, 15, january, 1822, legitimised, the, armed, rebellion, against, the, ottoman, empire, in, a, mix, of, religious, and, nationalist, terms, the, war, we, are, waging, against, the, turks, far, from, being, founded, in, demagoguery, seditiousness, or, the, selfish, interests, of, any, one, part, of, the, greek, nation, is, a, national, and, holy, war, it, is, from, these, principles, of, natural, rights, and, desiring, to, assimilate, ourselves, with, our, european, christian, brethren, that, we, have, embarked, upon, our, war, against, the, turks, scottish, writer, felicia, skene, remarked, in, 1877, the, greek, war, of, independence, has, never, been, called, a, religious, war, and, yet, it, had, a, better, claim, to, that, appellation, than, many, a, conflict, which, has, been, so, named, by, the, chroniclers, of, the, past, it, is, a, significant, fact, that, the, standard, of, revolt, was, raised, by, no, mere, patriot, but, by, germanus, the, aged, archbishop, of, patras, who, came, forward, strong, in, his, spiritual, dignity, to, be, the, first, champion, in, the, cause, of, hellenic, liberty, ian, morris, 1994, stated, that, the, uprising, in, 1821, was, mainly, a, religious, war, but, that, philhellene, western, volunteers, joined, the, war, for, quite, different, reasons, namely, to, regenerate, greece, and, thereby, europe, motivated, by, romantic, ideas, about, european, history, and, civilisation, and, orientalist, views, of, ottoman, culture, the, filiki, eteria, the, main, organisation, driving, the, rebellion, was, split, between, two, groups, one, advocated, the, restoration, of, the, byzantine, empire, on, religious, grounds, and, to, encourage, all, christians, within, ottoman, territory, to, join, the, greek, revolutionaries, the, other, advocated, the, megali, idea, a, large, greek, nation, state, based, on, shared, language, rather, than, religion, both, of, these, grand, objectives, failed, but, a, smaller, version, of, the, latter, goal, was, accepted, by, most, members, of, the, eteria, by, 1823, and, this, goal, was, generally, compatible, with, the, motives, of, philhellenes, who, travelled, to, greece, to, enter, the, war, in, 1821, 1823, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, can, primarily, be, viewed, as, an, ethnic, conflict, between, two, parties, where, one, party, is, most, often, portrayed, as, a, singular, ethno, religious, group, which, only, consists, of, the, jewish, majority, and, ignores, non, jewish, minority, israeli, citizens, who, support, the, existence, of, a, state, of, israel, to, varying, degrees, especially, the, druze, and, the, circassians, who, for, example, volunteer, to, serve, in, the, idf, participate, in, combat, and, are, represented, in, the, israeli, parliament, in, greater, percentages, than, israeli, jews, are, as, well, as, israeli, arabs, samaritans, various, other, christians, and, negev, bedouin, the, other, party, is, sometimes, presented, as, an, ethnic, group, which, is, multi, religious, although, most, numerously, consisting, of, muslims, then, christians, then, other, religious, groups, up, to, and, including, samaritans, and, even, jews, yet, despite, the, multi, religious, composition, of, both, of, the, parties, in, the, conflict, elements, on, both, sides, often, view, it, as, a, religious, war, between, jews, and, muslims, in, 1929, religious, tensions, between, muslim, and, jewish, palestinians, over, the, latter, praying, at, the, wailing, wall, led, to, the, 1929, palestine, riots, including, the, hebron, and, safed, massacres, in, 1947, the, un, s, decision, to, partition, the, mandate, of, palestine, led, to, the, creation, of, the, state, of, israel, and, jordan, which, annexed, the, west, bank, portion, of, the, mandate, since, then, the, region, has, been, plagued, with, conflict, the, 1948, palestinian, exodus, also, known, as, the, nakba, arabic, occurred, when, approximately, 711, 000, to, 726, 000, palestinian, arabs, fled, or, were, expelled, from, their, homes, during, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, and, the, civil, war, that, preceded, it, the, exact, number, of, refugees, is, a, matter, of, dispute, though, the, number, of, palestine, refugees, and, their, unsettled, descendants, registered, with, unrwa, is, more, than, 4, 3, million, the, causes, remain, the, subject, of, fundamental, disagreement, between, palestinians, and, israelis, both, jews, and, palestinians, make, ethnic, and, historical, claims, to, the, land, and, jews, make, religious, claims, as, well, according, to, historian, benny, morris, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, from, the, arab, perspective, was, a, war, of, religion, as, much, as, if, not, more, than, a, nationalist, war, over, territory, this, assertion, has, been, challenged, by, other, scholars, the, all, india, muslim, league, aiml, was, formed, in, dhaka, in, 1906, by, muslims, who, were, suspicious, of, the, hindu, majority, indian, national, congress, they, complained, that, muslim, members, did, not, have, the, same, rights, as, hindu, members, a, number, of, different, scenarios, were, proposed, at, various, times, this, was, fuelled, by, the, british, policy, of, divide, and, rule, which, they, tried, to, bring, upon, every, political, situation, among, the, first, to, make, the, demand, for, a, separate, state, was, the, writer, philosopher, allama, iqbal, who, in, his, presidential, address, to, the, 1930, convention, of, the, muslim, league, said, that, a, separate, nation, for, muslims, was, essential, in, an, otherwise, hindu, dominated, subcontinent, after, the, dissolution, of, the, british, raj, in, 1947, british, india, was, partitioned, into, two, new, sovereign, states, the, dominion, of, india, and, the, dominion, of, pakistan, in, the, resulting, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1947, 1948, up, to, 12, 5, million, people, were, displaced, with, estimates, of, loss, of, life, varying, from, several, hundred, thousand, to, a, million, india, emerged, as, a, secular, nation, with, a, hindu, majority, while, pakistan, was, established, as, an, islamic, republic, with, muslim, majority, population, inter, ethnic, conflict, in, nigeria, has, generally, had, a, religious, element, riots, against, igbo, in, 1953, and, in, the, 1960s, in, the, north, were, said, to, have, been, sparked, by, religious, conflict, the, riots, against, igbo, in, the, north, in, 1966, were, said, to, have, been, inspired, by, radio, reports, of, mistreatment, of, muslims, in, the, south, a, military, coup, d, tat, led, by, lower, and, middle, ranking, officers, some, of, them, igbo, overthrew, the, npc, ncnc, dominated, government, prime, minister, balewa, along, with, other, northern, and, western, government, officials, were, assassinated, during, the, coup, the, coup, was, considered, an, igbo, plot, to, overthrow, the, northern, dominated, government, a, counter, coup, was, launched, by, mostly, northern, troops, between, june, and, july, there, was, a, mass, exodus, of, ibo, from, the, north, and, west, over, 1, 3, million, ibo, fled, the, neighboring, regions, in, order, to, escape, persecution, as, anti, ibo, riots, increased, the, aftermath, of, the, anti, ibo, riots, led, many, to, believe, that, security, could, only, be, gained, by, separating, from, the, north, in, the, 1980s, serious, outbreaks, between, christians, and, muslims, occurred, in, kafanchan, in, southern, kaduna, state, in, a, border, area, between, the, two, religions, the, 2010, jos, riots, saw, clashes, between, muslim, herders, against, christian, farmers, near, the, volatile, city, of, jos, resulting, in, hundreds, of, casualties, officials, estimated, that, 500, people, were, massacred, in, night, time, raids, by, rampaging, muslim, gangs, during, the, rule, of, the, catholic, ngo, dinh, diem, in, south, vietnam, the, discrimination, against, the, majority, buddhist, population, generated, the, growth, of, buddhist, institutions, as, they, sought, to, participate, in, national, politics, and, gain, better, treatment, the, buddhist, uprising, of, 1966, was, a, period, of, civil, and, military, unrest, in, south, vietnam, largely, focused, in, the, i, corps, area, in, the, north, of, the, country, in, central, vietnam, in, a, country, where, the, buddhist, majority, was, estimated, to, be, between, 70, and, 90, percent, diem, ruled, with, a, strong, religious, bias, as, a, member, of, the, catholic, vietnamese, minority, he, pursued, pro, catholic, policies, that, antagonized, many, buddhists, the, dungan, revolt, 1862, 1877, and, panthay, rebellion, 1856, 1873, by, the, hui, were, also, set, off, by, racial, antagonism, and, class, warfare, rather, than, the, mistaken, assumption, that, it, was, all, due, to, islam, that, the, rebellions, broke, out, during, the, dungan, revolt, fighting, broke, out, between, uyghurs, and, hui, in, 1936, after, sheng, shicai, expelled, 20, 000, kazakhs, from, xinjiang, to, qinghai, the, hui, led, by, general, ma, bufang, massacred, their, fellow, muslims, the, kazakhs, until, there, were, only, 135, of, them, left, tensions, with, uyghurs, and, hui, arose, because, qing, and, republican, chinese, authorities, used, hui, troops, and, officials, to, dominate, the, uyghurs, and, crush, uyghur, revolts, xinjiang, s, hui, population, increased, by, over, 520, percent, between, 1940, and, 1982, an, average, annual, growth, rate, of, 4, 4, percent, while, the, uyghur, population, only, grew, by, 1, 7, percent, this, dramatic, increase, in, the, hui, population, led, inevitably, to, significant, tensions, between, the, hui, and, uyghur, muslim, populations, some, old, uyghurs, in, kashgar, remember, that, the, hui, army, at, the, battle, of, kashgar, 1934, massacred, 2, 000, to, 8, 000, uyghurs, which, caused, tension, as, more, hui, moved, into, kashgar, from, other, parts, of, china, some, hui, criticize, uyghur, separatism, and, generally, do, not, want, to, get, involved, in, conflicts, in, other, countries, over, islam, for, fear, of, being, perceived, as, radical, hui, and, uyghur, live, apart, from, each, other, praying, separately, and, attending, different, mosques, there, is, no, consensus, among, scholars, on, what, triggered, the, lebanese, civil, war, 1975, 1990, however, the, militarization, of, the, palestinian, refugee, population, along, with, the, arrival, of, the, plo, guerrilla, forces, sparked, an, arms, race, for, the, different, lebanese, political, factions, however, the, conflict, played, out, along, three, religious, lines, sunni, muslim, christian, lebanese, and, shiite, muslim, druze, are, considered, among, shiite, muslims, it, has, been, argued, that, the, antecedents, of, the, war, can, be, traced, back, to, the, conflicts, and, political, compromises, reached, after, the, end, of, lebanon, s, administration, by, the, ottoman, empire, the, cold, war, had, a, powerful, disintegrative, effect, on, lebanon, which, was, closely, linked, to, the, polarization, that, preceded, the, 1958, political, crisis, during, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, an, exodus, of, palestinian, refugees, who, fled, the, fighting, or, were, expelled, from, their, homes, arrived, in, lebanon, palestinians, came, to, play, a, very, important, role, in, future, lebanese, civil, conflicts, and, the, establishment, of, israel, radically, changed, the, local, environment, in, which, lebanon, found, itself, lebanon, was, promised, independence, which, was, achieved, on, 22, november, 1943, free, french, troops, who, had, invaded, lebanon, in, 1941, to, rid, beirut, of, the, vichy, french, forces, left, the, country, in, 1946, the, christians, assumed, power, over, the, country, and, its, economy, a, confessional, parliament, was, created, in, which, muslims, and, christians, were, given, quotas, of, seats, as, well, the, president, was, to, be, a, christian, the, prime, minister, a, sunni, muslim, and, the, speaker, of, parliament, a, shia, muslim, in, march, 1991, parliament,
