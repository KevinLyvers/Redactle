a, diaspora, d, a, s, p, r, dy, asp, r, is, a, population, that, is, scattered, across, regions, which, are, separate, from, its, geographic, place, of, origin, the, word, is, used, in, reference, to, people, who, identify, with, a, specific, geographic, location, but, currently, reside, elsewhere, notable, diasporic, populations, include, the, jewish, diaspora, formed, after, the, babylonian, exile, assyrian, chaldean, syriac, diaspora, following, the, assyrian, genocide, greeks, that, fled, or, were, displaced, following, the, fall, of, constantinople, and, the, later, greek, genocide, as, well, as, the, istanbul, pogroms, the, emigration, of, anglo, saxons, primarily, to, the, byzantine, empire, after, the, norman, conquest, of, england, the, southern, chinese, and, indians, who, left, their, homelands, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, irish, diaspora, after, the, great, famine, the, scottish, diaspora, that, developed, on, a, large, scale, after, the, highland, and, lowland, clearances, romani, from, the, indian, subcontinent, the, italian, diaspora, and, the, mexican, diaspora, circassians, in, the, aftermath, of, the, circassian, genocide, the, palestinian, diaspora, due, to, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, the, armenian, diaspora, following, the, armenian, genocide, the, lebanese, diaspora, due, to, the, lebanese, civil, war, and, syrians, due, to, the, syrian, civil, war, the, iranian, diaspora, which, grew, from, half, a, million, to, 3, 8, million, between, the, 1979, revolution, and, 2019, mostly, live, in, united, states, canada, and, turkey, according, to, a, 2019, united, nations, report, the, indian, diaspora, is, the, world, s, largest, diaspora, with, a, population, of, 17, 5, million, followed, by, the, mexican, diaspora, with, a, population, of, 11, 8, million, and, the, chinese, diaspora, with, a, population, of, 10, 7, million, the, term, diaspora, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, verb, diaspeir, i, scatter, i, spread, about, which, in, turn, is, composed, of, dia, between, through, across, and, the, verb, speir, i, sow, i, scatter, the, term, diaspora, hence, meant, scattering, there, is, confusion, over, the, exact, process, of, derivation, from, these, ancient, greek, verbs, to, the, concept, of, diaspora, many, cite, thucydides, 5th, century, bc, as, the, first, to, use, the, word, however, sociologist, st, phane, dufoix, remarks, not, only, is, the, noun, diaspora, quite, absent, from, the, greek, original, but, the, original, does, not, include, the, verb, diaspe, r, either, the, verb, used, is, the, verb, spe, r, seed, conjugated, in, the, passive, aorist, the, passage, in, thucydides, reads, translated, to, mean, those, of, the, aeginetans, who, did, not, settle, here, were, scattered, over, the, rest, of, hellas, dufoix, further, notes, of, all, the, occurrences, of, diaspora, in, the, thesaurus, linguae, graecae, tlg, which, draws, upon, almost, the, entire, written, corpus, in, the, greek, language, none, refer, to, colonisation, dufoix, surmises, that, the, confusion, may, stem, from, a, comment, by, jewish, historian, simon, dubnow, who, wrote, an, entry, on, diaspora, for, the, influential, encyclopaedia, of, the, social, sciences, his, entry, published, in, 1931, includes, the, following, remark, in, a, sense, magna, graecia, constituted, a, greek, diaspora, in, the, ancient, roman, empire, magna, graecia, refers, to, ancient, greek, colonies, established, along, the, italian, coast, which, lost, their, independence, following, the, second, punic, war, and, their, integration, into, the, roman, empire, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, word, diaspora, is, found, in, the, septuagint, first, in, and, secondly, in, when, the, bible, was, translated, into, greek, the, word, diaspora, was, applied, in, reference, to, the, kingdom, of, samaria, which, was, exiled, from, israel, by, the, assyrians, between, 740, and, 722, bc, as, well, as, jews, benjaminites, and, levites, who, were, exiled, from, the, kingdom, of, judah, by, the, babylonians, in, 587, bc, and, jews, who, were, exiled, from, roman, judea, by, the, roman, empire, in, 70, ad, it, subsequently, came, to, be, used, in, reference, to, the, historical, movements, and, settlement, patterns, of, the, jews, in, english, capitalized, and, without, modifiers, the, term, can, refer, specifically, to, the, jewish, diaspora, the, wider, application, of, diaspora, evolved, from, the, assyrian, two, way, mass, deportation, policy, of, conquered, populations, to, deny, future, territorial, claims, on, their, part, the, oldest, known, use, of, the, word, diaspora, in, english, is, in, 1594, in, john, stockwood, s, translation, of, lambert, daneau, s, commentary, on, the, twelve, prophets, daneau, writes, this, scattering, abrode, of, the, iewes, as, it, were, an, heauenly, sowing, fell, out, after, their, returne, from, the, captiuitie, of, babylon, wherevpon, both, acts, 2, and, also, 1, pet, 1, and, 1, iam, ver, 1, they, are, called, diaspora, that, is, a, scattering, or, sowing, abrode, however, the, current, entry, on, diaspora, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, online, dates, the, first, recorded, use, a, century, later, to, 1694, in, a, work, on, ordination, by, the, welsh, theologian, james, owen, owen, wanted, to, prove, that, there, is, no, difference, in, the, bible, between, presbyters, and, bishops, he, cited, the, example, of, the, jews, in, exile, the, presbyters, of, the, jewish, diaspora, to, whom, st, peter, wrote, are, requir, d, to, feed, or, rule, the, flock, and, to, perform, the, office, and, work, of, bishops, among, them, the, oed, records, a, usage, of, diaspora, in, 1876, which, refers, to, extensive, diaspora, work, as, it, is, termed, of, evangelizing, among, the, national, protestant, churches, on, the, continent, the, term, became, more, widely, assimilated, into, english, by, the, mid, 1950s, with, long, term, expatriates, in, significant, numbers, from, other, particular, countries, or, regions, also, being, referred, to, as, a, diaspora, an, academic, field, diaspora, studies, has, become, established, relating, to, this, sense, of, the, word, william, safran, in, an, article, published, in, 1991, set, out, six, rules, to, distinguish, diasporas, from, migrant, communities, these, included, criteria, that, the, group, maintains, a, myth, or, collective, memory, of, their, homeland, they, regard, their, ancestral, homeland, as, their, true, home, to, which, they, will, eventually, return, being, committed, to, the, restoration, or, maintenance, of, that, homeland, and, they, relate, personally, or, vicariously, to, the, homeland, to, a, point, where, it, shapes, their, identity, safran, s, definitions, were, influenced, by, the, idea, of, the, jewish, diaspora, safran, also, included, a, criterion, of, having, been, forced, into, exile, by, political, or, economic, factors, followed, by, a, long, period, of, settlement, in, the, new, host, culture, in, 1997, robin, cohen, argued, that, a, diasporic, group, could, leave, its, homeland, voluntarily, and, assimilate, deeply, into, host, cultures, rogers, brubaker, 2005, more, inclusively, applied, three, basic, definitional, criteria, first, geographic, dispersion, voluntary, or, forced, of, a, people, second, the, orientation, to, a, real, or, imagined, homeland, as, an, authoritative, source, of, value, identity, and, loyalty, and, third, maintenance, of, a, social, boundary, corresponding, to, the, conservation, of, a, distinctive, diasporic, identity, which, differs, from, the, host, culture, brubaker, also, noted, that, the, use, of, the, term, diaspora, has, been, widening, he, suggests, that, one, element, of, this, expansion, in, use, involves, the, application, of, the, term, diaspora, to, an, ever, broadening, set, of, cases, essentially, to, any, and, every, nameable, population, category, that, is, to, some, extent, dispersed, in, space, brubaker, used, the, worldcat, database, to, show, that, 17, out, of, the, 18, books, on, diaspora, published, between, 1900, and, 1910, were, on, the, jewish, diaspora, the, majority, of, works, in, the, 1960s, were, also, about, the, jewish, diaspora, but, in, 2002, only, two, out, of, 20, books, sampled, out, of, a, total, of, 253, were, about, the, jewish, case, with, a, total, of, eight, different, diasporas, covered, brubaker, outlined, the, original, use, of, the, term, diaspora, as, follows, most, early, discussions, of, the, diaspora, were, firmly, rooted, in, a, conceptual, homeland, they, were, concerned, with, a, paradigmatic, case, or, a, small, number, of, core, cases, the, paradigmatic, case, was, of, course, the, jewish, diaspora, some, dictionary, definitions, of, diaspora, until, recently, did, not, simply, illustrate, but, defined, the, word, with, reference, to, that, case, some, observers, have, labeled, evacuation, from, new, orleans, and, the, gulf, coast, in, the, wake, of, hurricane, katrina, the, new, orleans, diaspora, since, a, significant, number, of, evacuees, have, not, been, able, to, return, yet, maintain, aspirations, to, do, so, agnieszka, weinar, 2010, notes, the, widening, use, of, the, term, arguing, that, recently, a, growing, body, of, literature, succeeded, in, reformulating, the, definition, framing, diaspora, as, almost, any, population, on, the, move, and, no, longer, referring, to, the, specific, context, of, their, existence, it, has, even, been, noted, that, as, charismatic, christianity, becomes, increasingly, globalized, many, christians, conceive, of, themselves, as, a, diaspora, and, form, a, bond, that, mimics, salient, features, of, some, ethnic, diasporas, professional, communities, of, individuals, no, longer, in, their, homeland, can, also, be, considered, diaspora, for, example, science, diasporas, are, communities, of, scientists, who, conduct, their, research, away, from, their, homeland, and, trading, diasporas, are, communities, of, merchant, aliens, in, an, article, published, in, 1996, khachig, t, l, lyan, argues, that, the, media, have, used, the, term, corporate, diaspora, in, a, rather, arbitrary, and, inaccurate, fashion, for, example, as, applied, to, mid, level, mid, career, executives, who, have, been, forced, to, find, new, places, at, a, time, of, corporate, upheaval, 10, the, use, of, corporate, diaspora, reflects, the, increasing, popularity, of, the, diaspora, notion, to, describe, a, wide, range, of, phenomena, related, to, contemporary, migration, displacement, and, transnational, mobility, while, corporate, diaspora, seems, to, avoid, or, contradict, connotations, of, violence, coercion, and, unnatural, uprooting, historically, associated, with, the, notion, of, diaspora, its, scholarly, use, may, heuristically, describe, the, ways, in, which, corporations, function, alongside, diasporas, in, this, way, corporate, diaspora, might, foreground, the, racial, histories, of, diasporic, formations, without, losing, sight, of, the, cultural, logic, of, late, capitalism, in, which, corporations, orchestrate, the, transnational, circulation, of, people, images, ideologies, and, capital, in, contemporary, times, scholars, have, classified, the, different, kinds, of, diasporas, based, on, their, causes, such, as, colonialism, trade, labour, migrations, or, the, social, coherence, which, exists, within, the, diaspora, communities, and, their, ties, to, the, ancestral, lands, some, diaspora, communities, maintain, strong, cultural, and, political, ties, to, their, homelands, other, qualities, that, may, be, typical, of, many, diasporas, are, thoughts, of, return, to, the, ancestral, lands, maintaining, any, form, of, ties, with, the, region, of, origin, as, well, as, relationships, with, other, communities, in, the, diaspora, and, lack, of, full, integration, into, the, new, host, countries, diasporas, often, maintain, ties, to, the, country, of, their, historical, affiliation, and, usually, influence, their, current, host, country, s, policies, towards, their, homeland, diaspora, management, is, a, term, that, harris, mylonas, has, re, conceptualized, to, describe, both, the, policies, that, states, follow, in, order, to, build, links, with, their, diaspora, abroad, and, the, policies, designed, to, help, with, the, incorporation, and, integration, of, diasporic, communities, when, they, return, home, the, diaspora, of, africans, during, the, atlantic, slave, trade, is, one, of, the, most, notorious, modern, diasporas, 10, 7, million, people, from, west, africa, survived, transportation, to, arrive, in, the, americas, as, slaves, starting, in, the, late, 16th, century, ce, and, continuing, into, the, 19th, outside, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, however, african, diasporic, communities, have, existed, for, millennia, while, some, communities, were, slave, based, other, groups, emigrated, for, various, reasons, from, the, 8th, through, the, 19th, centuries, the, arab, slave, trade, dispersed, millions, of, africans, to, asia, and, the, islands, of, the, indian, ocean, the, islamic, slave, trade, also, has, resulted, in, the, creation, of, communities, of, african, descent, in, india, most, notably, the, siddi, makrani, and, sri, lanka, kaffirs, beginning, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, kingdom, of, aksum, modern, day, ethiopia, created, colonies, on, the, arabian, peninsula, during, the, 4th, century, aksum, formally, adopted, christianity, as, a, state, religion, becoming, the, first, to, do, so, along, with, armenia, in, the, 6th, century, kaleb, of, axum, invaded, himyar, modern, day, yemen, to, aid, and, defend, christians, under, religious, persecution, during, these, campaigns, several, groups, of, soldiers, chose, not, to, return, to, aksum, these, groups, are, estimated, to, have, ranged, in, size, from, the, 600s, to, mid, 3000s, previously, migrant, africans, with, national, african, passports, could, only, enter, thirteen, african, countries, without, advanced, visas, in, pursuing, a, unified, future, the, african, union, au, launched, an, african, union, passport, in, july, 2016, allowing, people, with, a, passport, from, one, of, the, 55, member, states, of, the, au, to, move, freely, between, these, countries, under, this, visa, free, passport, and, encourage, migrants, with, national, african, passports, to, return, to, africa, the, largest, asian, diaspora, in, the, world, is, the, indian, diaspora, the, overseas, indian, community, estimated, to, number, over, 17, 5, million, is, spread, across, many, regions, of, the, world, on, every, continent, it, is, a, global, community, which, is, diverse, heterogeneous, and, eclectic, and, its, members, represent, different, regions, languages, cultures, and, faiths, see, desi, similarly, the, romani, numbering, roughly, 12, million, in, europe, trace, their, origins, to, the, indian, subcontinent, and, their, presence, in, europe, is, first, attested, to, in, the, middle, ages, the, earliest, known, asian, diaspora, of, note, is, the, jewish, diaspora, with, roots, in, the, babylonian, captivity, and, later, migrations, under, hellenism, the, majority, of, the, diaspora, can, be, attributed, to, the, roman, conquest, expulsion, and, enslavement, of, the, jewish, population, of, judea, whose, descendants, became, the, ashkenazim, sephardim, and, mizrahim, of, today, roughly, numbering, 15, million, of, which, 8, million, still, live, in, the, diaspora, though, the, number, was, much, higher, before, zionist, immigration, to, what, is, now, israel, and, the, murder, of, 6, million, jews, in, the, holocaust, chinese, emigration, also, known, as, the, chinese, diaspora, see, also, overseas, chinese, first, occurred, thousands, of, years, ago, the, mass, emigration, that, occurred, from, the, 19th, century, to, 1949, was, caused, mainly, by, wars, and, starvation, in, mainland, china, as, well, as, political, corruption, most, migrants, were, illiterate, or, poorly, educated, peasants, called, by, the, now, recognized, racial, slur, coolies, chinese, literally, hard, labor, who, migrated, to, developing, countries, in, need, of, labor, such, as, the, americas, australia, south, africa, southeast, asia, malaya, and, other, places, pakistani, diaspora, is, the, third, in, asia, with, approximately, 9, million, pakistanis, living, abroad, mostly, in, middle, east, north, america, and, europe, at, least, three, waves, of, nepalese, diaspora, can, be, identified, the, earliest, wave, dates, back, to, hundreds, of, years, as, early, marriage, and, high, birthrates, propelled, hindu, settlement, eastward, across, nepal, then, into, sikkim, and, bhutan, a, backlash, developed, in, the, 1980s, as, bhutan, s, political, elites, realized, that, bhutanese, buddhists, were, at, risk, of, becoming, a, minority, in, their, own, country, at, least, 60, 000, ethnic, nepalese, from, bhutan, have, been, resettled, in, the, united, states, a, second, wave, was, driven, by, british, recruitment, of, mercenary, soldiers, beginning, around, 1815, and, resettlement, after, retirement, in, the, british, isles, and, southeast, asia, the, third, wave, began, in, the, 1970s, as, land, shortages, intensified, and, the, pool, of, educated, labor, greatly, exceeded, job, openings, in, nepal, job, related, emigration, created, nepalese, enclaves, in, india, the, wealthier, countries, of, the, middle, east, europe, and, north, america, current, estimates, of, the, number, of, nepalese, living, outside, nepal, range, well, up, into, the, millions, in, siam, regional, power, struggles, among, several, kingdoms, in, the, region, led, to, a, large, diaspora, of, ethnic, lao, between, the, 1700s, 1800s, by, siamese, rulers, to, settle, large, areas, of, the, siamese, kingdom, s, northeast, region, where, lao, ethnicity, is, still, a, major, factor, in, 2012, during, this, period, siam, decimated, the, lao, capital, capturing, torturing, and, killing, the, lao, king, anuwongse, who, led, the, lao, rebellion, in, the, 19th, century, european, history, contains, numerous,

and, language, around, the, mediterranean, and, black, sea, basins, establishing, greek, city, states, in, southern, italy, the, so, called, magna, graecia, northern, libya, eastern, spain, the,

in, egypt, southwest, asia, and, northwest, india, subsequent, waves, of, colonization, and, migration, during, the, middle, ages, added, to, the, older, settlements, or, created, new, ones, thus, replenishing, the, greek, diaspora, and, making, it, one, of, the, most, long, standing, and, widespread, in, the, world, the, romans, also, established, numerous, colonies, and, settlements, outside, of, rome, and, throughout, the, roman, empire, the, migration, period, relocations, which, included, several, phases, are, just, one, set, of, many, in, history, the, first, phase, migration, period, displacement, between, 300, and, 500, ad, included, relocation, of, the, goths, ostrogoths, and, visigoths, vandals, franks, various, other, germanic, peoples, burgundians, lombards, angles, saxons, jutes, suebi, and, alemanni, alans, and, numerous, slavic, tribes, the, second, phase, between, 500, and, 900, ad, saw, slavic, turkic, and, other, tribes, on, the, move, resettling, in, eastern, europe, and, gradually, leaving, it, predominantly, slavic, and, affecting, anatolia, and, the, caucasus, as, the, first, turkic, tribes, avars, huns, khazars, pechenegs, as, well, as, bulgars, and, possibly, magyars, arrived, the, last, phase, of, the, migrations, saw, the, coming, of, the, hungarian, magyars, the, viking, expansion, out, of, scandinavia, into, southern, and, eastern, europe, iceland, the, british, isles, and, greenland, the, recent, application, of, the, word, diaspora, to, the, viking, lexicon, highlights, their, cultural, profile, distinct, from, their, predatory, reputation, in, the, regions, they, settled, especially, in, the, north, atlantic, the, more, positive, connotations, associated, with, the, social, science, term, help, to, view, the, movement, of, the, scandinavian, peoples, in, the, viking, age, in, a, new, way, such, colonizing, migrations, cannot, be, considered, indefinitely, as, diasporas, over, very, long, periods, eventually, the, migrants, assimilate, into, the, settled, area, so, completely, that, it, becomes, their, new, mental, homeland, thus, the, modern, magyars, of, hungary, do, not, feel, that, they, belong, in, the, western, siberia, that, the, hungarian, magyars, left, 12, centuries, ago, and, the, english, descendants, of, the, angles, saxons, and, jutes, do, not, yearn, to, reoccupy, the, plains, of, northwest, germany, in, 1492, a, spanish, financed, expedition, headed, by, christopher, columbus, arrived, in, the, americas, after, which, european, exploration, and, colonization, rapidly, expanded, historian, james, axtell, estimates, that, 240, 000, people, left, europe, for, the, americas, in, the, 16th, century, emigration, continued, in, the, 19th, century, alone, over, 50, million, europeans, migrated, to, north, and, south, america, other, europeans, moved, to, siberia, africa, and, australasia, the, properly, spanish, emigrants, were, mainly, from, several, parts, of, spain, but, not, only, the, impoverished, ones, i, e, basques, in, chile, and, the, destination, varied, also, along, the, time, as, an, example, the, galicians, moved, first, to, the, american, colonies, during, the, xvii, xx, mainly, but, not, only, mexico, cuba, argentine, and, venezuela, as, many, writers, during, the, francoist, exile, later, to, europe, france, switzerland, and, finally, within, spain, to, madrid, catalonia, or, the, basque, country, a, specific, 19th, century, example, is, the, irish, diaspora, beginning, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, brought, about, by, an, gorta, m, r, or, the, great, hunger, of, the, irish, famine, an, estimated, 45, to, 85, of, ireland, s, population, emigrated, to, areas, including, britain, the, united, states, canada, argentina, australia, and, new, zealand, the, size, of, the, irish, diaspora, is, demonstrated, by, the, number, of, people, around, the, world, who, claim, irish, ancestry, some, sources, put, the, figure, at, 80, to, 100, million, from, the, 1860s, the, circassian, people, originally, from, europe, were, dispersed, through, anatolia, australia, the, balkans, the, levant, north, america, and, west, europe, leaving, less, than, 10, of, their, population, in, the, homeland, parts, of, historical, circassia, in, the, modern, day, russian, portion, of, the, caucasus, the, scottish, diaspora, includes, large, populations, of, highlanders, moving, to, the, united, states, and, canada, after, the, highland, clearances, as, well, as, the, lowlanders, becoming, the, ulster, scots, in, ireland, and, the, scotch, irish, in, america, there, were, two, major, italian, diasporas, in, italian, history, the, first, diaspora, began, around, 1880, two, decades, after, the, unification, of, italy, and, ended, in, the, 1920s, to, the, early, 1940s, with, the, rise, of, fascist, italy, poverty, was, the, main, reason, for, emigration, specifically, the, lack, of, land, as, mezzadria, sharecropping, flourished, in, italy, especially, in, the, south, and, property, became, subdivided, over, generations, especially, in, southern, italy, conditions, were, harsh, until, the, 1860s, to, 1950s, most, of, italy, was, a, rural, society, with, many, small, towns, and, cities, and, almost, no, modern, industry, in, which, land, management, practices, especially, in, the, south, and, the, northeast, did, not, easily, convince, farmers, to, stay, on, the, land, and, to, work, the, soil, another, factor, was, related, to, the, overpopulation, of, southern, italy, as, a, result, of, the, improvements, in, socioeconomic, conditions, after, unification, that, created, a, demographic, boom, and, forced, the, new, generations, to, emigrate, en, masse, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, mostly, to, the, americas, the, new, migration, of, capital, created, millions, of, unskilled, jobs, around, the, world, and, was, responsible, for, the, simultaneous, mass, migration, of, italians, searching, for, work, and, bread, the, second, diaspora, started, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, concluded, roughly, in, the, 1970s, between, 1880, and, 1980, about, 15, 000, 000, italians, left, the, country, permanently, by, 1980, it, was, estimated, that, about, 25, 000, 000, italians, were, residing, outside, italy, in, the, united, states, of, america,

has, occurred, for, a, number, of, different, factors, over, the, course, of, canadian, history, an, example, is, the, migration, of, workers, from, atlantic, canada, particularly, newfoundland, and, labrador, to, alberta, driven, in, part, by, the, cod, collapse, in, the, early, 1990s, and, the, 1992, moratorium, on, cod, fishing, fishing, had, previously, been, a, major, driver, of, the, economies, of, the, atlantic, provinces, and, this, loss, of, work, proved, catastrophic, for, many, families, as, a, result, beginning, in, the, early, 1990s, and, into, the, late, 2000s, thousands, of, people, from, the, atlantic, provinces, were, driven, out, of, province, to, find, work, elsewhere, in, the, country, especially, in, the, alberta, oil, sands, during, the, oil, boom, of, the, mid, 2000s, this, systemic, export, of, labour, is, explored, by, author, kate, beaton, in, her, 2022, graphic, memoir, ducks, which, details, her, experience, working, in, the, athabasca, oil, sands, with, the, fall, of, fascist, regime, in, 1943, and, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, a, large, internal, migratory, flow, began, from, one, italian, region, to, another, this, internal, emigration, was, sustained, and, constantly, increased, by, the, economic, growth, that, italy, experienced, between, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, given, that, this, economic, growth, mostly, concerned, northwest, italy, which, was, involved, in, the, birth, of, many, industrial, activities, migratory, phenomena, affected, the, peasants, of, the, triveneto, and, southern, italy, who, began, to, move, in, large, numbers, other, areas, of, northern, italy, were, also, affected, by, emigration, such, as, the, rural, areas, of, mantua, and, cremona, the, destinations, of, these, emigrants, were,

immigration, flow, these, migratory, movements, were, accompanied, by, other, flows, of, lesser, intensity, such, as, transfers, from, the, countryside, to, smaller, cities, and, travel, from, mountainous, areas, to, the, plains, the, main, reasons, that, gave, rise, to, this, massive, migratory, flow, were, linked, to, the, living, conditions, in, the, places, of, origin, of, the, emigrants, which, were, very, harsh, the, absence, of, stable, work, the, high, rate, of, poverty, the, poor, fertility, of, many, agricultural, areas, the, fragmentation, of, land, properties, which,
