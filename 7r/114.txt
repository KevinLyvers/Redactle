to, support, the, person, s, retirement, from, work, a, pension, may, be, pensions, should, not, be, confused, with, severance, pay, the, former, is, usually, paid, in, regular, amounts, for, life, after, retirement, while, the, latter, is, typically, paid, as, a, fixed, amount, after, involuntary, termination, of, employment, before, retirement, the, terms, retirement, plan, and, superannuation, tend, to, refer, to, a, pension, granted, upon, retirement, of, the, individual, the, terminology, varies, between, countries, retirement, plans, may, be, set, up, by, employers, insurance, companies, the, government, or, other, institutions, such, as, employer, associations, or, trade, unions, called, retirement, plans, in, the, united, states, they, are, commonly, known, as, pension, schemes, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, and, superannuation, plans, or, super, in, australia, and, new, zealand, retirement, pensions, are, typically, in, the, form, of, a, guaranteed, life, annuity, thus, insuring, against, the, risk, of, longevity, a, pension, created, by, an, employer, for, the, benefit, of, an, employee, is, commonly, referred, to, as, an, occupational, or, employer, pension, labor, unions, the, government, or, other, organizations, may, also, fund, pensions, occupational, pensions, are, a, form, of, deferred, compensation, usually, advantageous, to, employee, and, employer, for, tax, reasons, many, pensions, also, contain, an, additional, insurance, aspect, since, they, often, will, pay, benefits, to, survivors, or, disabled, beneficiaries, other, vehicles, certain, lottery, payouts, for, example, or, an, annuity, may, provide, a, similar, stream, of, payments, the, common, use, of, the, term, pension, is, to, describe, the, payments, a, person, receives, upon, retirement, usually, under, predetermined, legal, or, contractual, terms, a, recipient, of, a, retirement, pension, is, known, as, a, pensioner, or, retiree, a, retirement, plan, is, an, arrangement, to, provide, people, with, an, income, during, retirement, when, they, are, no, longer, earning, a, steady, income, from, employment, often, retirement, plans, require, both, the, employer, and, employee, to, contribute, money, to, a, fund, during, their, employment, in, order, to, receive, defined, benefits, upon, retirement, it, is, a, tax, deferred, savings, vehicle, that, allows, for, the, tax, free, accumulation, of, a, fund, for, later, use, as, retirement, income, funding, can, be, provided, in, other, ways, such, as, from, labor, unions, government, agencies, or, self, funded, schemes, pension, plans, are, therefore, a, form, of, deferred, compensation, a, ssas, is, a, type, of, employment, based, pension, in, the, uk, the, 401, k, is, the, iconic, self, funded, retirement, plan, that, many, americans, rely, on, for, much, of, their, retirement, income, these, sometimes, include, money, from, an, employer, but, are, usually, mostly, or, entirely, funded, by, the, individual, using, an, elaborate, scheme, where, money, from, the, employee, s, paycheck, is, withheld, at, their, direction, to, be, contributed, by, their, employer, to, the, employee, s, plan, this, money, can, be, tax, deferred, or, not, depending, on, the, exact, nature, of, the, plan, some, countries, also, grant, pensions, to, military, veterans, military, pensions, are, overseen, by, the, government, an, example, of, a, standing, agency, is, the, united, states, department, of, veterans, affairs, ad, hoc, committees, may, also, be, formed, to, investigate, specific, tasks, such, as, the, u, s, commission, on, veterans, pensions, commonly, known, as, the, bradley, commission, in, 1955, 56, pensions, may, extend, past, the, death, of, the, veteran, himself, continuing, to, be, paid, to, the, widow, many, countries, have, created, funds, for, their, citizens, and, residents, to, provide, income, when, they, retire, or, in, some, cases, become, disabled, typically, this, requires, payments, throughout, the, citizen, s, working, life, in, order, to, qualify, for, benefits, later, on, a, basic, state, pension, is, a, contribution, based, benefit, and, depends, on, an, individual, s, contribution, history, for, examples, see, national, insurance, in, the, uk, or, social, security, in, the, united, states, of, america, many, countries, have, also, put, in, place, a, social, pension, these, are, regular, tax, funded, non, contributory, cash, transfers, paid, to, older, people, over, 80, countries, have, social, pensions, some, are, universal, benefits, given, to, all, older, people, regardless, of, income, assets, or, employment, record, examples, of, universal, pensions, include, new, zealand, superannuation, and, the, basic, retirement, pension, of, mauritius, most, social, pensions, though, are, means, tested, such, as, supplemental, security, income, in, the, united, states, of, america, or, the, older, person, s, grant, in, south, africa, some, pension, plans, will, provide, for, members, in, the, event, they, suffer, a, disability, this, may, take, the, form, of, early, entry, into, a, retirement, plan, for, a, disabled, member, below, the, normal, retirement, age, the, benefits, of, defined, benefit, and, defined, contribution, plans, differ, based, on, the, degree, of, financial, security, provided, to, the, retiree, with, defined, benefit, plans, retirees, receive, a, guaranteed, payout, at, retirement, determined, by, a, fixed, formula, based, on, factors, such, as, salary, and, years, of, service, the, risk, and, responsibility, of, ensuring, sufficient, funding, through, retirement, is, borne, by, the, employer, or, plan, managers, this, type, of, plan, provides, a, level, of, financial, security, for, retirees, ensuring, they, will, receive, a, specific, amount, of, income, throughout, their, retirement, years, however, this, income, is, not, usually, guaranteed, to, keep, up, with, inflation, so, its, purchasing, power, may, decline, over, the, years, on, the, other, hand, defined, contribution, plans, are, dependent, upon, the, amount, of, money, contributed, and, the, performance, of, the, investment, vehicles, used, employees, are, responsible, for, ensuring, that, their, contributions, are, sufficient, to, provide, for, their, retirement, needs, and, they, face, the, risk, of, market, fluctuations, that, could, reduce, their, retirement, savings, however, defined, contribution, plans, provide, more, flexibility, for, employees, who, can, choose, how, much, to, contribute, and, how, to, invest, their, funds, hybrid, plans, such, as, cash, balance, and, pension, equity, plans, combine, features, of, both, defined, benefit, and, defined, contribution, plans, these, plans, have, become, increasingly, popular, in, the, us, since, the, 1990s, cash, balance, plans, for, example, provide, a, guaranteed, benefit, like, a, defined, benefit, plan, but, the, benefit, is, expressed, as, an, account, balance, like, a, defined, contribution, plan, pension, equity, plans, are, a, type, of, cash, balance, plan, that, credits, employee, accounts, with, a, percentage, of, their, pay, each, year, similar, to, a, defined, contribution, plan, a, defined, benefit, db, pension, plan, is, a, plan, in, which, workers, accrue, pension, rights, during, their, time, at, a, firm, and, upon, retirement, the, firm, pays, them, a, benefit, that, is, a, function, of, that, worker, s, tenure, at, the, firm, and, of, their, earnings, in, other, words, a, db, plan, is, a, plan, in, which, the, benefit, on, retirement, is, determined, by, a, set, formula, rather, than, depending, on, investment, returns, government, pensions, such, as, social, security, in, the, united, states, are, a, type, of, defined, benefit, pension, plan, traditionally, defined, benefit, plans, for, employers, have, been, administered, by, institutions, which, exist, specifically, for, that, purpose, by, large, businesses, or, for, government, workers, by, the, government, itself, a, traditional, form, of, defined, benefit, plan, is, the, final, salary, plan, under, which, the, pension, paid, is, equal, to, the, number, of, years, worked, multiplied, by, the, member, s, salary, at, retirement, multiplied, by, a, factor, known, as, the, accrual, rate, the, final, accrued, amount, is, available, as, a, monthly, pension, or, a, lump, sum, but, usually, monthly, in, the, us, 26, u, s, c, 414, j, specifies, a, defined, benefit, plan, to, be, any, pension, plan, that, is, not, a, defined, contribution, plan, see, below, where, a, defined, contribution, plan, is, any, plan, with, individual, accounts, a, traditional, pension, plan, that, defines, a, benefit, for, an, employee, upon, that, employee, s, retirement, is, a, defined, benefit, plan, in, the, u, s, corporate, defined, benefit, plans, along, with, many, other, types, of, defined, benefit, plans, are, governed, by, the, employee, retirement, income, security, act, of, 1974, erisa, in, the, united, kingdom, benefits, are, typically, indexed, for, inflation, known, as, retail, prices, index, rpi, as, required, by, law, for, registered, pension, plans, inflation, during, an, employee, s, retirement, affects, the, purchasing, power, of, the, pension, the, higher, the, inflation, rate, the, lower, the, purchasing, power, of, a, fixed, annual, pension, this, effect, can, be, mitigated, by, providing, annual, increases, to, the, pension, at, the, rate, of, inflation, usually, capped, for, instance, at, 5, in, any, given, year, this, method, is, advantageous, for, the, employee, since, it, stabilizes, the, purchasing, power, of, pensions, to, some, extent, if, the, pension, plan, allows, for, early, retirement, payments, are, often, reduced, to, recognize, that, the, retirees, will, receive, the, payouts, for, longer, periods, of, time, in, the, united, states, under, the, employee, retirement, income, security, act, of, 1974, any, reduction, factor, less, than, or, equal, to, the, actuarial, early, retirement, reduction, factor, is, acceptable, many, db, plans, include, early, retirement, provisions, to, encourage, employees, to, retire, early, before, the, attainment, of, normal, retirement, age, usually, age, 65, companies, would, rather, hire, younger, employees, at, lower, wages, some, of, those, provisions, come, in, the, form, of, additional, temporary, or, supplemental, benefits, which, are, payable, to, a, certain, age, usually, before, attaining, normal, retirement, age, due, to, changes, in, pensions, over, the, years, many, pension, systems, including, those, in, alabama, california, indiana, and, new, york, have, shifted, to, a, tiered, system, for, a, simplified, example, suppose, there, are, three, employees, that, pay, into, a, state, pension, system, sam, veronica, and, jessica, the, state, pension, system, has, three, tiers, tier, i, tier, ii, and, tier, iii, these, three, tiers, are, based, on, the, employee, s, hire, date, i, e, tier, i, covers, 1, january, 1980, and, before, to, 1, january, 1995, tier, ii, 2, january, 1995, to, 1, january, 2010, and, tier, iii, 1, january, 2010, to, present, and, have, different, benefit, provisions, e, g, tier, i, employees, can, retire, at, age, 50, with, 80, benefits, or, wait, until, 55, with, full, benefits, tier, ii, employees, can, retire, at, age, 55, with, 80, benefits, or, wait, until, 60, for, full, benefits, tier, iii, employees, can, retire, at, age, 65, with, full, benefits, therefore, sam, hired, in, june, 1983, would, be, subject, to, the, provisions, of, the, tier, i, scheme, whereas, veronica, hired, in, august, 1995, would, be, permitted, to, retire, at, age, 60, with, full, benefits, and, jessica, hired, in, december, 2014, would, not, be, able, to, retire, with, full, benefits, until, she, became, 65, defined, benefit, plans, may, be, either, funded, or, unfunded, in, an, unfunded, defined, benefit, pension, no, assets, are, set, aside, and, the, benefits, are, paid, for, by, the, employer, or, other, pension, sponsor, as, and, when, they, are, paid, pension, arrangements, provided, by, the, state, in, most, countries, in, the, world, are, unfunded, with, benefits, paid, directly, from, current, workers, contributions, and, taxes, this, method, of, financing, is, known, as, pay, as, you, go, or, paygo, the, social, security, systems, of, many, european, countries, are, unfunded, having, benefits, paid, directly, out, of, current, taxes, and, social, security, contributions, although, several, countries, have, hybrid, systems, which, are, partially, funded, spain, set, up, the, social, security, reserve, fund, and, france, set, up, the, pensions, reserve, fund, in, canada, the, wage, based, retirement, plan, cpp, is, partially, funded, with, assets, managed, by, the, cpp, investment, board, while, the, u, s, social, security, system, is, partially, funded, by, investment, in, special, u, s, treasury, bonds, in, a, funded, plan, contributions, from, the, employer, and, sometimes, also, from, plan, members, are, invested, in, a, fund, towards, meeting, the, benefits, all, plans, must, be, funded, in, some, way, even, if, they, are, pay, as, you, go, so, this, type, of, plan, is, more, accurately, known, as, pre, funded, or, fully, funded, the, future, returns, on, the, investments, and, the, future, benefits, to, be, paid, are, not, known, in, advance, so, there, is, no, guarantee, that, a, given, level, of, contributions, will, be, enough, to, meet, the, benefits, typically, the, contributions, to, be, paid, are, regularly, reviewed, in, a, valuation, of, the, plan, s, assets, and, liabilities, carried, out, by, an, actuary, to, ensure, that, the, pension, fund, will, meet, future, payment, obligations, this, means, that, in, a, defined, benefit, pension, investment, risk, and, investment, rewards, are, typically, assumed, by, the, sponsor, employer, and, not, by, the, individual, if, a, plan, is, not, well, funded, the, plan, sponsor, may, not, have, the, financial, resources, to, continue, funding, the, plan, traditional, defined, benefit, plan, designs, because, of, their, typically, flat, accrual, rate, and, the, decreasing, time, for, interest, discounting, as, people, get, closer, to, retirement, age, tend, to, exhibit, a, j, shaped, accrual, pattern, of, benefits, where, the, present, value, of, benefits, grows, quite, slowly, early, in, an, employee, s, career, and, accelerates, significantly, in, mid, career, in, other, words, it, costs, more, to, fund, the, pension, for, older, employees, than, for, younger, ones, an, age, bias, defined, benefit, pensions, tend, to, be, less, portable, than, defined, contribution, plans, even, if, the, plan, allows, a, lump, sum, cash, benefit, at, termination, most, plans, however, pay, their, benefits, as, an, annuity, so, retirees, do, not, bear, the, risk, of, low, investment, returns, on, contributions, or, of, outliving, their, retirement, income, the, open, ended, nature, of, these, risks, to, the, employer, is, the, reason, given, by, many, employers, for, switching, from, defined, benefit, to, defined, contribution, plans, over, recent, years, the, risks, to, the, employer, can, sometimes, be, mitigated, by, discretionary, elements, in, the, benefit, structure, for, instance, in, the, rate, of, increase, granted, on, accrued, pensions, both, before, and, after, retirement, the, age, bias, reduced, portability, and, open, ended, risk, make, defined, benefit, plans, better, suited, to, large, employers, with, less, mobile, workforces, such, as, the, public, sector, which, has, open, ended, support, from, taxpayers, this, coupled, with, a, lack, of, foresight, on, the, employers, part, means, a, large, proportion, of, the, workforce, are, kept, in, the, dark, over, future, investment, schemes, defined, benefit, plans, are, sometimes, criticized, as, being, paternalistic, as, they, enable, employers, or, plan, trustees, to, make, decisions, about, the, type, of, benefits, and, family, structures, and, lifestyles, of, their, employees, however, they, are, typically, more, valuable, than, defined, contribution, plans, in, most, circumstances, and, for, most, employees, mainly, because, the, employer, tends, to, pay, higher, contributions, than, under, defined, contribution, plans, so, such, criticism, is, rarely, harsh, the, cost, of, a, defined, benefit, plan, is, not, easily, calculated, and, requires, an, actuary, or, actuarial, software, however, even, with, the, best, of, tools, the, cost, of, a, defined, benefit, plan, will, always, be, an, estimate, based, on, economic, and, financial, assumptions, these, assumptions, include, the, average, retirement, age, and, lifespan, of, the, employees, the, returns, to, be, earned, by, the, pension, plan, s, investments, and, any, additional, taxes, or, levies, such, as, those, required, by, the, pension, benefit, guaranty, corporation, in, the, u, s, so, for, this, arrangement, the, benefit, is, relatively, secure, but, the, contribution, is, uncertain, even, when, estimated, by, a, professional, this, has, serious, cost, considerations, and, risks, for, the, employer, offering, a, pension, plan, one, of, the, growing, concerns, with, defined, benefit, plans, is, that, the, level, of, future, obligations, will, outpace, the, value, of, assets, held, by, the, plan, this, underfunding, dilemma, can, be, faced, by, any, type, of, defined, benefit, plan, private, or, public, but, it, is, most, acute, in, governmental, and, other, public, plans, where, political, pressures, and, less, rigorous, accounting, standards, can, result, in, excessive, commitments, to, employees, and, retirees, but, inadequate, contributions, many, states, and, municipalities, across, the, united, states, of, america, and, canada, now, face, chronic, pension, crises, a, defined, contribution, dc, plan, is, a, pension, plan, where, employers, set, aside, a, certain, proportion, i, e, contributions, of, a, worker, s, earnings, such, as, 5, in, an, investment, account, and, the, worker, receives, this, savings, and, any, accumulated, investment, earnings, upon, retirement, these, contributions, are, paid, into, an, individual, account, for, each, member, the, contributions, are, invested, for, example, in, the, stock, market, and, the, returns, on, the, investment, which, may, be, positive, or, negative, are, credited, to, the, individual, s, account, on, retirement, the, member, s, account, is, used, to, provide, retirement, benefits, sometimes, through, the, purchase, of, an, annuity, which, then, provides, a, regular, income, defined, contribution, plans, have, become, widespread, all, over, the, world, in, recent, years, and, are, now, the, dominant, form, of, plan, in, the, private, sector, in, many, countries, for, example, the, number, of, defined, benefit, plans, in, the, us, has, been, steadily, declining, as, more, and, more, employers, see, pension, contributions, as, a, large, expense, avoidable, by, disbanding, the, defined, benefit, plan, and, instead, offering, a, defined, contribution, plan, money, contributed, can, either, be, from, employee, salary, deferral, or, from, employer, contributions, the, portability, of, defined, contribution, pensions, is, legally, no, different, from, the, portability, of, defined, benefit, plans, however, because, of, the, cost, of, administration, and, ease, of, determining, the, plan, sponsor, s, liability, for, defined, contribution, plans, you, do, not, need, to, pay, an, actuary, to, calculate, the, lump, sum, equivalent, that, you, do, for, defined, benefit, plans, in, practice, defined, contribution, plans, have, become, generally, portable, in, a, defined, contribution, plan, investment, risk, and, investment, rewards, are, assumed, by, each, individual, employee, retiree, and, not, by, the, sponsor, employer, and, these, risks, may, be, substantial, in, addition, participants, do, not, necessarily, purchase, annuities, with, their, savings, upon, retirement, and, bear, the, risk, of, outliving, their, assets, in, the, united, kingdom, for, instance, it, is, a, legal, requirement, to, use, the, bulk, of, the, fund, to, purchase, an, annuity, the, cost, of, a, defined, contribution, plan, is, readily, calculated, but, the, benefit, from, a, defined, contribution, plan, depends, upon, the, account, balance, at, the, time, an, employee, is, looking, to, use, the, assets, so, for, this, arrangement, the, contribution, is, known, but, the, benefit, is, unknown, until, calculated, despite, the, fact, that, the, participant, in, a, defined, contribution, plan, typically, has, control, over, investment, decisions, the, plan, sponsor, retains, a, significant, degree, of, fiduciary, responsibility, over, investment, of, plan, assets, including, the, selection, of, investment, options, and, administrative, providers, in, the, united, states, the, legal, definition, of, a, defined, contribution, plan, is, a, plan, providing, for, an, individual, account, for, each, participant, and, for, benefits, based, solely, on, the, amount, contributed, to, the, account, plus, or, minus, income, gains, expenses, and, losses, allocated, to, the, account, see, 26, u, s, c, 414, i, examples, of, defined, contribution, plans, in, the, united, states, include, individual, retirement, accounts, iras, and, 401, k, plans, in, such, plans, the, employee, is, responsible, to, one, degree, or, another, for, selecting, the, types, of, investments, toward, which, the, funds, in, the, retirement, plan, are, allocated, this, may, range, from, choosing, one, of, a, small, number, of, pre, determined, mutual, funds, to, selecting, individual, stocks, or, other, financial, assets, most, self, directed, retirement, plans, are, characterized, by, certain, tax, advantages, and, some, provide, for, a, portion, of, the, employee, s, contributions, to, be, matched, by, the, employer, in, exchange, the, funds, in, such, plans, may, not, be, withdrawn, by, the, investor, prior, to, reaching, a, certain, age, typically, the, year, the, employee, reaches, 59, 5, years, old, with, a, small, number, of, exceptions, without, incurring, a, substantial, penalty, advocates, of, defined, contribution, plans, point, out, that, each, employee, has, the, ability, to, tailor, the, investment, portfolio, to, his, or, her, individual, needs, and, financial, situation, including, the, choice, of, how, much, to, contribute, if, anything, at, all, however, others, state, that, these, apparent, advantages, could, also, hinder, some, workers, who, might, not, possess, the, financial, savvy, to, choose, the, correct, investment, vehicles, or, have, the, discipline, to, voluntarily, contribute, money, to, retirement, accounts, in, the, us, defined, contribution, plans, are, subject, to, irs, limits, on, how, much, can, be, contributed, known, as, the, section, 415, limit, in, 2009, the, total, deferral, amount, including, employee, contribution, plus, employer, contribution, was, limited, to, 49, 000, or, 100, of, compensation, whichever, is, less, the, employee, only, limit, in, 2009, was, 16, 500, with, a, 5, 500, catch, up, these, numbers, usually, increase, each, year, and, are, indexed, to, compensate, for, the, effects, of, inflation, for, 2015, the, limits, were, raised, to, 53, 000, and, 18, 000, respectively, examples, of, defined, contribution, pension, schemes, in, other, countries, are, the, uk, s, personal, pensions, and, proposed, national, employment, savings, trust, nest, germany, s, riester, plans, australia, s, superannuation, system, and, new, zealand, s, kiwisaver, scheme, individual, pension, savings, plans, also, exist, in, austria, czech, republic, denmark, greece, finland, ireland, netherlands, slovenia, and, spain, many, developed, economies, are, moving, beyond, db, dc, plans, and, are, adopting, a, new, breed, of, collective, risk, sharing, schemes, where, plan, members, pool, their, contributions, and, to, a, greater, or, less, extent, share, the, investment, and, longevity, risk, there, are, multiple, naming, conventions, for, these, plans, reflecting, the, fact, that, the, future, payouts, are, a, target, or, ambition, of, the, plan, sponsor, rather, than, a, guarantee, common, naming, conventions, include, defined, contribution, pensions, by, definition, are, funded, as, the, guarantee, made, to, employees, is, that, specified, defined, contributions, will, be, made, during, an, individual, s, working, life, there, are, many, ways, to, finance, a, pension, and, save, for, retirement, pension, plans, can, be, set, up, by, an, employer, matching, a, monetary, contribution, each, month, by, the, state, or, personally, through, a, pension, scheme, with, a, financial, institution, such, as, a, bank, or, brokerage, firm, pension, plans, often, come, with, a, tax, break, depending, on, the, country, and, plan, type, for, example, canadians, have, the, option, to, open, a, registered, retirement, savings, plan, rrsp, as, well, as, a, range, of, employee, and, state, pension, programs, this, plan, allows, contributions, to, this, account, to, be, marked, as, un, taxable, income, and, remain, un, taxed, until, withdrawal, most, countries, governments, will, provide, advice, on, pension, schemes, social, and, state, pensions, depend, largely, upon, legislation, for, their, sustainability, some, have, identified, funds, but, these, hold, essentially, government, bonds, a, form, of, iou, by, the, state, which, may, rank, no, higher, than, the, state, s, promise, to, pay, future, pensions, occupational, pensions, are, typically, provided, through, employment, agreements, between, workers, and, employers, and, their, financing, structure, must, meet, legislative, requirements, in, common, law, jurisdictions, the, law, requires, that, pensions, be, pre, funded, in, trusts, with, a, range, of, requirements, to, ensure, the, trustees, act, in, the, best, interests, of, the, beneficiaries, these, jurisdictions, account, for, over, 80, of, assets, held, by, private, pension, plans, around, the, world, of, the, 50, 7, trillion, of, global, assets, in, 2019, 32, 2t, were,

statutory, trusts, tend, to, be, more, uniform, and, tightly, regulated, however, pension, assets, alone, are, not, a, useful, guide, to, the, total, distribution, of, occupational, pensions, around, the, world, it, will, be, noted, that, four, of, the, largest, economies, germany, france, italy, and, spain, have, very, little, in, the, way, of, pension, assets, nevertheless, in, terms, of, typical, net, income, replacement, in, retirement, these, countries, rank, well, relative, to, those, with, pension, assets, these, and, other, countries, represent, a, fundamentally, different, approach, to, pension, provision, often, referred, to, as, intergenerational, solidarity, intergenerational, solidarity, operates, to, an, extent, in, any, country, with, a, defined, benefit, social, security, system, but, is, more, controversial, when, applied, to, high, levels, of, professional, income, why, should, younger, generations, pay, for, executive, pensions, which, they, themselves, are, unsure, of, collecting, employers, have, sought, ways, of, getting, round, this, problem, through, pre, funding, but, in, civil, law, countries, have, often, been, limited, by, the, legal, vehicles, available, a, suitable, legal, vehicle, should, ideally, have, three, qualities, first, it, should, convince, employees, that, the, assets, are, truly, secured, for, their, benefit, second, contributions, to, the, vehicle, should, be, tax, deductible, to, the, employer, or, at, least, a, tax, deduction, should, be, secured, already, and, third, to, the, extent, that, it, has, funded, the, pension, liability, the, employer, should, be, able, to, reduce, the, liability, shown, on, its, balance, sheet, in, the, absence, of, appropriate, statute, attempts, have, been, made, to, invent, suitable, vehicles, with, varying, degrees, of, success, the, most, notable, has, been, in, germany, where, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, most, occupational, pensions, were, unfunded, book, reserved, promises, by, employers, changes, started, in, 1983, in, the, classical, world, romans, offered, veteran, legionnaires, centurions, military, pensions, typically, in, the, form, of, a, land, grant, or, a, special, often, semi, public, appointment, augustus, caesar, 63, bc, ad, 14, introduced, one, of, the, first, recognisable, pension, schemes, in, history, with, his, military, treasury, in, 13, bc, augustus, created, a, pension, plan, in, which, retired, soldiers, were, to, receive, a, pension, of, minimum, 3, 000, denarii, in, a, lump, sum, which, at, the, time, represented, around, 13, times, a, legionnaires, annual, salary, after, 16, years, of, service, in, a, legion, and, four, years, in, the, military, reserves, the, retiring, soldiers, were, in, the, beginning, paid, from, general, revenues, and, later, from, a, special, fund, aeririum, militare, established, by, augustus, in, 5, or, 6, ad, this, was, in, an, attempt, to, quell, a, rebellion, within, the, roman, empire, which, was, facing, militaristic, turmoil, at, the, time, widows, funds, were, among, the, first, pension, type, arrangement, to, appear, for, example, duke, ernest, the, pious, of, gotha, in, germany, founded, a, widows, fund, for, clergy, in, 1645, and, another, for, teachers, in, 1662, various, schemes, of, provision, for, ministers, widows, were, then, established, throughout, europe, at, about, the, start, of, the, eighteenth, century, some, based, on, a, single, premium, others, based, on, yearly, premiums, to, be, distributed, as, benefits, in, the, same, year, modern, forms, of, pension, systems, were, first, introduced, in, the, late, 19th, century, germany, was, the, first, country, to, introduce, a, universal, pension, program, for, employees, as, part, of, otto, von, bismarck, s, social, legislation, the, old, age, and, disability, insurance, bill, was, enacted, and, implemented, in, 1889, the, old, age, pension, program, financed, by, a, tax, on, workers, was, originally, designed, to, provide, a, pension, annuity, for, workers, who, reached, the, age, of, 70, years, though, this, was, lowered, to, 65, years, in, 1916, unlike, accident, insurance, and, health, insurance, this, program, covered, industrial, agrarian, artisans, and, servants, from, the, start, and, was, supervised, directly, by, the, state, germany, s, mandatory, state, pension, provisions, are, based, on, the, pay, as, you, go, or, redistributive, model, funds, paid, in, by, contributors, employees, and, employers, are, not, saved, and, neither, invested, but, are, used, to, pay, current, pension, obligations, recently, the, german, government, has, come, under, criticism, for, the, impending, disaster, posed, by, the, exorbitant, tax, burden, resulting, from, civil, servants, pensions, a, study, commissioned, by, the, taxpayers, association, that, professor, bernd, raffelh, schen, of, the, generation, contracts, research, center, of, the, university, of, freiburg, carried, out, states, that, by, 2050, the, state, will, have, to, spend, 1, 3, to, 1, 4, trillion, eur, to, supply, its, civil, servants, the, majority, of, it, about, 870, billion, eur, is, therefore, spent, on, pensions, the, federal, government, s, financial, statements, for, 2016, already, show, the, extent, of, that, disaster, according, to, this, the, expected, costs, for, pensions, and, subsidies, for, medical, treatment, for, the, number, of, federal, civil, servants, at, the, end, of, 2016, will, amount, to, 647, billion, eur, over, the, course, of, the, next, ten, years, that, is, 63, billion, eur, more, than, in, the, previous, year, an, increase, of, ten, percent, in, just, one, year, the, sum, is, divided, into, officials, judges, and, soldiers, account, for, 238, 4, billion, eur, of, the, expected, pension, expenditure, of, almost, 478, billion, eur, in, addition, there, are, legacy, issues, from, the, times, of, large, state, owned, companies, the, federal, government, has, to, pay, out, 171, billion, eur, for, old, age, pensions, for, former, postal, officials, and, 68, 5, billion, eur, for, former, railway, officials, the, problem, while, the, government, preaches, private, pension, provision, to, workers, the, state, itself, has, failed, to, build, adequate, reserves, for, the, wave, of, pensions, in, the, coming, years, the, federal, government, has, been, trying, to, create, a, cushion, since, 2007, so, far, however, this, has, amounted, to, only, 14, billion, eur, by, 2018, professor, bernd, raffelh, schen, criticised, that, the, state, had, made, high, pension, commitments, for, decades, but, initially, didn, t, build, up, any, reserves, for, a, long, time, pensions, thus, represent, a, considerable, burden, for, public, budgets, as, professor, bernd, raffelh, schen, calculated, in, his, study, in, 2005, the, present, value, of, the, pension, burden, for, the, federal, states, amounts, to, 1, 797, billion, eur, which, is, larger, than, the, germany, s, total, public, debt, in, various, federal, states, efforts, are, being, made, to, secure, pension, expenditure, by, setting, up, pension, funds, for, newly, hired, civil, servants, fiscal, relief, is, however, to, be, expected, only, when, the, newly, hired, officials, retire, the, share, of, tax, revenue, needed, to, supply, for, the, pensions, will, increase, from, approximately, 10, in, 2001, in, many, federal, states, to, over, 20, in, 2020, in, the, extreme, case, of, the, city, state, of, hamburg, every, fourth, euro, of, income, will, be, used, to, finance, pensions, for, their, retired, civil, servants, there, is, a, history, of, pensions, in, ireland, that, can, be, traced, back, to, brehon, law, imposing, a, legal, responsibility, on, the, kin, group, to, take, care, of, its, members, who, were, aged, blind, deaf, sick, or, insane, for, a, discussion, on, pension, funds, and, early, irish, law, see, f, kelly, a, guide, to, early, irish, law, dublin, dublin, institute, for, advanced, studies, 1988, in, 2010, there, were, over, 76, 291, pension, schemes, operating, in, ireland, in, january, 2018, a, total, contributions, approach, qualification, system, was, announced, effective, from, march, 2018, for, those, pensioners, who, reached, state, pension, age, after, 1, september, 2012, the, new, system, requires, a, person, to, have, 40, years, worth, or, contributions, to, receive, the, full, rate, and, a, minimum, total, period, of, paid, contributions, of, 520, weeks, with, ten, years, full, coverage, the, state, pension, is, payable, from, age, 66, with, the, age, being, increased, to, 67, in, 2021, and, 68, in, 2028, the, history, of, pensions, in, spain, began, in, 1908, with, the, creation, of, the, national, insurance, institute, inp, and, the, design, of, old, age, pensions, in, a, free, affiliation, scheme, subsidised, by, the, state, although, in, 1919, the, pension, system, was, made, compulsory, and, in, 1931, an, attempt, was, made, to, unify, the, different, branches, of, insurance, the, inp, failed, to, ensure, that, pensions, acted, as, immediate, remedial, measures, for, the, old, age, problem, that, was, evident, at, the, time, public, intervention, in, social, insurance, in, spain, during, these, years, was, greatly, determined, by, the, failure, of, private, initiatives, such, as, the, savings, and, pension, fund, of, barcelona, the, mandatory, workers, retirement, roo, was, the, first, compulsory, social, insurance, in, spain, and, was, aimed, at, wage, earners, between, the, ages, of, 16, and, 65, who, earned, no, more, than, 4, 000, pesetas, a, year, this, was, followed, by, the, creation, of, the, social, security, system, in, 1963, early, retirement, and, the, possibility, of, partial, retirement, in, 1978, and, the, special, regime, for, self, employed, workers, in, 1985, various, reforms, and, adjustments, have, been, made, over, time, such, as, the, 1995, reform, that, established, the, sustainability, factor, and, the, 2011, reform, that, raised, the, retirement, age, from, 65, to, 67, currently, the, pension, system, in, spain, is, still, under, debate, to, ensure, its, long, term, sustainability, with, proposals, such, as, the, implementation, of, private, pension, plans, and, the, revision, of, the, conditions, of, access, to, public, pensions, the, decline, of, feudal, systems, and, formation, of, national, states, throughout, europe, led, to, the, reemergence, of, standing, armies, with, their, allegiances, to, states, consequently, the, sixteenth, century, in, england, marked, the, establishment, of, standardised, systems, of, military, pensions, during, its, 1592, 93, session, parliament, established, disability, payments, or, reliefe, for, souldiours, adventured, their, lives, and, lost, their, limbs, or, disabled, their, bodies, in, the, service, of, the, crown, this, pension, was, again, generous, by, contemporary, standards, even, though, annual, pensions, were, not, to, exceed, ten, pounds, for, private, soldiers, or, twenty, pounds, for, a, lieutenant, the, beginning, of, the, modern, state, pension, came, with, the, old, age, pensions, act, 1908, that, provided, 5, shillings, 0, 25, a, week, for, those, over, 70, whose, annual, means, do, not, exceed, 31, 50, it, coincided, with, the, royal, commission, on, the, poor, laws, and, relief, of, distress, 1905, 09, and, was, the, first, step, in, the, liberal, welfare, reforms, to, the, completion, of, a, system, of, social, security, with, unemployment, and, health, insurance, through, the, national, insurance, act, 1911, in, 1921, the, finance, act, introduced, tax, relief, on, pension, contributions, in, line, with, savings, and, life, insurance, as, a, consequence, the, overall, size, of, the, fund, was, increased, since, the, income, tax, was, now, added, to, the, pension, as, well, then, in, 1978, the, state, earnings, related, pension, scheme, serps, replaced, the, graduated, pension, scheme, from, 1959, providing, a, pension, related, to, earnings, in, addition, to, the, basic, state, pension, employees, and, employers, had, the, possibility, to, contribute, to, it, between, 6, april, 1978, and, 5, april, 2002, when, it, was, replaced, by, the, state, second, pension, after, the, second, world, war, the, national, insurance, act, 1946, completed, universal, coverage, of, social, security, introducing, a, state, pension, for, everybody, on, a, contributory, basis, with, men, being, eligible, at, 65, and, women, at, 60, the, national, assistance, act, 1948, 11, 12, geo, 6, c, 29, formally, abolished, the, poor, law, and, gave, a, minimum, income, to, those, not, paying, national, insurance, the, early, 1990s, established, the, existing, framework, for, state, pensions, in, the, social, security, contributions, and, benefits, act, 1992, and, superannuation, and, other, funds, validation, act, 1992, following, the, highly, respected, goode, report, occupational, pensions, were, covered, by, comprehensive, statutes, in, the, pension, schemes, act, 1993, and, the, pensions, act, 1995, in, 2002, the, pensions, commission, was, established, as, a, cross, party, body, to, review, pensions, in, the, united, kingdom, the, first, act, to, follow, was, the, pensions, act, 2004, that, updated, regulation, by, replacing, opra, with, the, pensions, regulator, and, relaxing, the, stringency, of, minimum, funding, requirements, for, pensions, while, ensuring, protection, for, insolvent, businesses, in, a, major, update, of, the, state, pension, the, pensions, act, 2007, which, aligned, and, raised, retirement, ages, following, that, the, pensions, act, 2008, has, set, up, automatic, enrolment, for, occupational, pensions, and, a, public, competitor, designed, to, be, a, low, cost, and, efficient, fund, manager, called, the, national, employment, savings, trust, or, nest, the, first, american, pensions, came, in, 1636, when, plymouth, colony, and, subsequently, other, colonies, such, as, virginia, maryland, 1670s, and, ny, 1690s, offered, the, first, colonial, pension, the, general, assembly, of, the, virginia, company, followed, by, approving, a, resolution, known, as, virginia, act, ix, of, 1644, stating, that, all, hurt, or, maymed, men, be, relieved, and, provided, for, by, the, several, counties, where, such, men, reside, or, inhabit, furthermore, during, king, philip, s, war, otherwise, known, as, the, first, indian, war, this, act, was, expanded, to, widows, and, orphans, in, virginia, s, act, of, 1675, public, pensions, got, their, start, with, various, promises, informal, and, legislated, made, to, veterans, of, the, revolutionary, war, and, more, extensively, the, civil, war, they, were, expanded, greatly, and, began, to, be, offered, by, a, number, of, state, and, local, governments, during, the, early, progressive, era, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, federal, civilian, pensions, were, offered, under, the, civil, service, retirement, system, csrs, formed, in, 1920, csrs, provided, retirement, disability, and, survivor, benefits, for, most, civilian, employees, in, the, us, federal, government, until, the, creation, of, a, new, federal, agency, the, federal, employees, retirement, system, fers, in, 1987, pension, plans, became, popular, in, the, united, states, during, world, war, ii, when, wage, freezes, prohibited, outright, increases, in, workers, pay, the, defined, benefit, plan, had, been, the, most, popular, and, common, type, of, retirement, plan, in, the, united, states, through, the, 1980s, since, that, time, defined, contribution, plans, have, become, the, more, common, type, of, retirement, plan, in, the, united, states, and, many, other, western, countries, in, april, 2012, the, northern, mariana, islands, retirement, fund, filed, for, chapter, 11, bankruptcy, protection, the, retirement, fund, is, a, defined, benefit, type, pension, plan, and, was, only, partially, funded, by, the, government, with, only, 268, 4, million, in, assets, and, 911, million, in, liabilities, the, plan, experienced, low, investment, returns, and, a, benefit, structure, that, had, been, increased, without, raises, in, funding, according, to, pensions, and, investments, this, is, apparently, the, first, us, public, pension, plan, to, declare, bankruptcy, a, growing, challenge, for, many, nations, is, population, ageing, as, birth, rates, drop, and, life, expectancy, increases, an, ever, larger, portion, of, the, population, is, elderly, this, leaves, fewer, workers, for, each, retired, person, in, many, developed, countries, this, means, that, government, and, public, sector, pensions, could, potentially, be, a, drag, on, their, economies, unless, pension, systems, are, reformed, or, taxes, are, increased, one, method, of, reforming, the, pension, system, is, to, increase, the, retirement, age, two, exceptions, are, australia, and, canada, where, the, pension, system, is, forecast, to, be, solvent, for, the, foreseeable, future, in, canada, for, instance, the, annual, payments, were, increased, by, some, 70, in, 1998, to, achieve, this, these, two, nations, also, have, an, advantage, from, their, relative, openness, to, immigration, immigrants, tend, to, be, of, working, age, however, their, populations, are, not, growing, as, fast, as, the, u, s, which, supplements, a, high, immigration, rate, with, one, of, the, highest, birthrates, among, western, countries, thus, the, population, in, the, u, s, is, not, ageing, to, the, extent, as, those, in, europe, australia, or, canada, another, growing, challenge, is, the, recent, trend, of, states, and, businesses, in, the, united, states, purposely, under, funding, their, pension, schemes, in, order, to, push, the, costs, onto, the, federal, government, for, example, in, 2009, the, majority, of, states, have, unfunded, pension, liabilities, exceeding, all, reported, state, debt, bradley, belt, former, executive, director, of, the, pbgc, the, pension, benefit, guaranty, corporation, the, federal, agency, that, insures, private, sector, defined, benefit, pension, plans, in, the, event, of, bankruptcy, testified, before, a, congressional, hearing, in, october, 2004, i, am, particularly, concerned, with, the, temptation, and, indeed, growing, tendency, to, use, the, pension, insurance, fund, as, a, means, to, obtain, an, interest, free, and, risk, free, loan, to, enable, companies, to, restructure, unfortunately, the, current, calculation, appears, to, be, that, shifting, pension, liabilities, onto, other, premium, payers, or, potentially, taxpayers, is, the, path, of, least, resistance, rather, than, a, last, resort, challenges, have, further, been, increased, by, the, post, 2007, credit, crunch, total, funding, of, the, nation, s, 100, largest, corporate, pension, plans, fell, by, 303bn, in, 2008, going, from, a, 86bn, surplus, at, the, end, of, 2007, to, a, 217bn, deficit, at, the, end, of, 2008, the, inequality, between, men, and, women, in, terms, of, pensions, is, a, significant, issue, all, around, the, world, in, this, sense, the, european, union, and, oecd, countries, are, not, an, exception, as, per, a, 2015, report, by, the, european, commission, the, average, pension, gender, gap, in, the, eu28, was, 40, 2, in, 2014, this, means, that, men, aged, 65, 74, on, average, receive, pensions, that, are, 40, 2, higher, than, those, of, women, in, the, same, age, group, this, gap, is, much, larger, than, the, gender, pay, gap, 16, 1, and, the, annual, earnings, gender, gap, 23, 0, in, 2014, and, 2010, respectively, the, countries, with, the, highest, pension, gender, gaps, are, cyprus, germany, the, netherlands, and, austria, and, 14, eu, member, states, have, a, pension, gender, gap, of, at, least, 30, however, eastern, european, countries, have, a, smaller, pension, gender, gap, due, to, less, pronounced, gender, differences, in, part, time, work, usage, in, oecd, countries, women, aged, 65, and, over, receive, around, 74, of, men, s, retirement, income, from, both, public, and, private, pension, sources, the, gender, pension, gap, in, oecd, countries, varies, from, 3, in, estonia, to, 47, in, japan, despite, some, progress, in, some, countries, over, the, years, the, gender, pension, gap, remains, a, major, issue, in, many, nations, as, for, the, possible, causes, of, the, pension, gender, gap, phenomenon, it, is, likely, that, women, are, more, affected, due, to, gender, segregation, in, the, labour, market, and, the, unequal, division, of, care, roles, in, households, in, addition, women, tend, to, be, more, dependent, on, basic, pensions, which, makes, them, more, vulnerable, to, reductions, in, these, kind, of, pensions, in, favour, of, occupational, ones, moreover, the, fact, that, many, current, pension, systems, require, a, minimum, of, 40, years, of, work, to, build, up, occupational, pensions, or, penalise, part, time, employment, together, with, the, limited, care, services, many, of, them, offer, for, babies, means, that, women, because, of, the, need, to, interrupt, their, working, lives, for, maternity, are, at, a, disadvantage, compared, to, men, when, it, comes, to, collecting, pensions, which, is, aggravated, by, the, fact, that, occupational, pensions, are, gaining, more, and, more, weight, compared, to, basic, pensions, in, the, current, structure, lower, employment, rates, and, the, gender, pay, gap, due, to, lower, wages, and, career, breaks, are, also, factors, contributing, to, the, gender, pension, gap, furthermore, individual, and, occupational, pensions, are, often, based, on, actuarial, equity, which, penalises, women, with, gender, differentiated, rates, finally, cultural, and, behavioural, factors, such, as, lack, of, access, to, education, and, gender, expectations, can, also, contribute, to, the, gender, pay, gap, and, the, gender, pension, gap, economic, uncertainty, can, also, be, a, cause, for, worry, in, the, near, future, as, of, april, 2023, the, global, economy, has, been, volatile, in, recent, years, and, this, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, pension, plans, for, example, low, interest, rates, can, make, it, more, difficult, for, pension, funds, to, generate, returns, on, their, investments, which, can, in, turn, lead, to, lower, benefits, for, pensioners, in, addition, economic, downturns, can, lead, to, higher, unemployment, rates, which, can, result, in, lower, contributions, to, pension, plans, this, recent, period, of, economic, uncertainty, has, seen, a, rise, in, self, employed, workers, as, such, the, rise, of, gig, economy, and, the, increasing, number, of, workers, who, are, self, employed, has, made, it, more, challenging, to, provide, retirement, benefits, to, a, growing, segment, of, the, workforce, due, to, the, fact, that, many, of, these, workers, do, not, have, access, to, employer, sponsored, pension, plans, making, it, more, difficult, for, them, to, save, for, retirement, most, national, pension, systems, are, based, on, multi, pillar, schemes, to, ensure, greater, flexibility, and, financial, security, to, the, old, in, contrast, to, reliance, on, one, single, system, in, general, there, are, three, main, functions, of, pension, systems, saving, redistribution, and, insurance, functions, according, to, the, report, by, the, world, bank, titled, averting, the, old, age, crisis, countries, should, consider, separating, the, saving, and, redistributive, functions, when, creating, pension, systems, and, placing, them, under, different, financing, and, managerial, arrangements, into, three, main, pillars, the, pillars, of, old, age, income, security, however, this, typology, is, rather, a, prescriptive, than, a, descriptive, one, and, most, specialists, usually, allocate, all, public, programmes, to, the, first, pillar, including, earnings, related, public, schemes, which, does, not, fit, the, original, definition, of, the, first, pillar, this, non, contributory, pillar, was, introduced, only, recently, aiming, to, alleviate, poverty, among, the, elderly, and, permitting, fiscal, conditions, it, is, usually, financed, by, the, state, and, is, in, form, of, basic, pension, schemes, or, social, assistance, in, some, typologies, the, zero, and, the, first, pillar, overlap, pillar, 1, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, public, pillar, or, first, tier, answers, the, aim, to, prevent, the, poverty, of, the, elderly, provide, some, absolute, minimum, income, based, on, solidarity, and, replace, some, portion, of, lifetime, pre, retirement, income, it, is, financed, on, a, redistributive, principle, without, constructing, large, reserves, and, takes, the, form, of, mandatory, contributions, linked, to, earnings, such, as, minimum, pensions, within, earnings, related, plans, or, separate, targeted, programs, for, retirement, income, these, are, provided, by, the, public, sector, and, typically, financed, on, pay, as, you, go, basis, pillar, 2, or, the, second, tier, built, on, the, basis, of, defined, benefit, and, defined, contribution, plans, with, independent, investment, management, aims, to, protect, the, elderly, from, relative, poverty, and, provides, benefits, supplementary, to, the, income, from, the, first, pillar, to, contributors, therefore, the, second, pillar, fulfils, the, insurance, function, in, addition, to, db, s, and, dc, s, other, types, of, pension, schemes, of, the, second, pillar, are, the, contingent, accounts, known, also, as, notional, defined, contributions, implemented, for, example, in, italy, latvia, poland, and, sweden, or, occupational, pension, schemes, applied, for, instance, in, estonia, germany, and, norway, the, third, tier, consists, of, voluntary, contributions, in, various, different, forms, including, occupational, or, private, saving, plans, and, products, for, individuals, the, fourth, pillar, is, usually, excluded, from, classifications, since, it, does, not, usually, have, a, legal, basis, and, consists, of, informal, support, such, as, family, other, formal, social, programs, such, as, health, care, or, housing, and, other, individual, assets, such, as, home, ownership, and, reverse, mortgages, these, five, pillars, and, their, main, criteria, are, summarised, in, the, table, below, by, holzmann, and, hinz, multipillar, pension, taxonomy, government, can, play, with, four, different, channels, to, finance, the, retirement, pension, these, economic, policies, are, the, following, ones, these, channels, have, been, used, by, many, governments, to, implement, new, retirement, pension, reforms, in, the, past, they, had, been, sometimes, simultaneously, used, two, or, three, channels, used, in, the, same, time, for, a, pension, reform, or, with, a, targeted, way, on, a, certain, group, of, persons, such, as, in, a, certain, business, sector, retirement, pensions, turn, out, to, be, considerable, amounts, of, money, for, instance, in, france, it, is, about, 300, billion, euros, each, year, namely, 14, 15, of, french, gdp, it, is, therefore, very, interesting, and, informative, to, illustrate, the, impacts, of, these, different, channels, to, finance, the, retirement, pension, especially, nowadays, since, many, riots, take, place, in, different, countries, against, new, retirement, pension, reforms, or, willing, to, change, the, national, retirement, pension, process, simulating, these, economic, policies, is, then, useful, to, understand, every, mechanism, linked, to, these, channels, four, different, channels, to, finance, retirement, pensions, will, be, simulated, successively, and, will, allow, to, explain, their, impacts, on, main, economic, variables, presented, below, with, an, eight, year, horizon, some, software, of, macroeconomic, simulation, allows, to, compute, and, display, them, the, implementation, of, these, economic, shocks, and, their, mechanisms, will, be, analysed, in, the, following, sections, this, economic, shock, is, to, permanently, decrease, the, amount, of, real, pensions, paid, to, retirees, by, for, example, 1, gdp, point, transfers, from, public, power, to, households, are, therefore, dropped, by, 1, gdp, point, in, the, case, of, france, given, 14, 15, of, gdp, corresponds, to, retirement, pensions, this, is, a, drop, of, 7, 5, of, mass, pension, benefits, it, proves, to, be, demand, shock, insofar, as, the, household, s, available, income, decreases, in, the, short, term, this, drop, of, purchasing, power, implies, a, diminishment, of, consumption, and, of, demand, in, general, the, activity, is, then, negatively, affected, however, the, current, account, is, improved, as, imports, decrease, following, the, reduce, of, domestic, demand, in, the, medium, term, since, this, cut, of, consumption, and, demand, unemployment, increases, the, price, index, decreases, as, the, consumption, price, drops, as, a, consequence, exports, increase, the, real, labour, cost, falls, increasing, thus, companies, margins, which, limits, the, degradation, of, investments, the, drop, of, consumption, remains, higher, than, the, increase, of, current, account, which, thereby, results, in, the, decrease, of, gdp, the, public, finance, balance, increases, following, the, diminishment, of, pension, benefits, spent, to, retirees, however, unemployment, benefits, increase, and, given, the, drop, of, consumption, and, of, household, s, incomes, which, implies, a, fall, in, the, incomes, received, from, income, tax, and, vat, by, public, administration, this, economic, shock, involves, the, permanent, increase, of, employee, social, contribution, by, for, instance, 2, points, this, social, contribution, is, spent, by, household, as, a, share, of, mass, wages, received, by, them, it, turns, out, to, be, a, demand, shock, because, household, s, disposable, income, decreases, from, the, short, term, indeed, the, income, perceived, by, employees, is, reduced, following, the, increase, of, employee, social, contribution, as, the, previous, channel, the, drop, of, purchasing, power, result, in, a, diminishment, of, consumption, and, demand, in, general, it, implies, a, drop, in, activity, however, the, current, account, is, improved, as, imports, are, reduced, following, the, cut, of, interior, demand, in, the, medium, term, the, implications, are, similar, to, the, decrease, of, real, pensions, employment, and, the, price, index, decrease, exports, increase, and, the, drop, of, investments, is, limited, the, gdp, decreases, too, finally, in, the, short, term, the, public, finance, balance, increases, but, is, quickly, limited, but, remains, an, increase, with, the, decrease, of, revenues, from, vat, and, income, taxes, and, the, increase, of, unemployment, this, economic, shock, is, to, permanently, increase, employer, social, contribution, by, for, instance, 2, points, this, social, contribution, is, spent, by, employer, as, a, share, of, mass, wages, paid, to, each, employee, it, proves, to, be, a, supply, economic, shock, indeed, the, rise, of, the, labour, cost, degrades, the, labour, demand, and, increases, the, costs, of, production, the, competitivity, is, degraded, and, results, in, the, drop, of, the, purchasing, power, job, losses, are, then, attended, the, unemployment, strongly, increases, this, shock, is, also, inflationary, given, that, household, s, consumption, prices, rise, as, corporations, profitability, drops, exports, and, companies, investment, fall, too, the, current, account, drops, and, this, shock, is, not, expansionist, the, gdp, decreases, finally, the, public, finance, balance, is, improved, but, less, than, planned, indeed, employer, social, contribution, is, increased, but, it, happens, to, be, less, than, expected, as, unemployment, rises, in, addition, income, tax, is, lower, than, before, the, shock, employee, social, contribution, increases, and, unemployment, benefits, expenses, increase, this, economic, shock, involves, an, increase, of, the, retirement, age, to, do, so, it, implies, a, permanent, increase, in, the, working, age, of, for, instance, 2, and, to, decrease, the, number, of, retirees, of, an, equivalent, amount, for, this, last, step, it, is, tantamount, to, decrease, global, real, pensions, by, a, certain, number, of, gdp, point, in, order, to, find, this, precise, number, for, the, simulation, we, can, assume, people, live, on, average, 80, years, study, during, 20, years, and, are, retirees, during, 20, years, as, a, consequence, an, increase, of, 2, for, life, expectancy, at, work, amounts, to, a, decrease, of, 4, for, life, expectancy, in, retirement, real, pensions, make, globally, a, certain, percentage, of, the, gdp, according, to, the, country, chosen, by, knowing, it, you, can, finally, find, the, certain, number, of, gdp, point, to, simulate, the, decrease, of, number, of, retirees, for, instance, in, france, real, pensions, make, globally, around, 15, of, gdp, finally, 4, of, 15, makes, a, decrease, of, 0, 6, of, gdp, point, in, the, short, term, this, labour, force, shock, supply, policy, leads, to, an, increase, of, unemployment, which, negatively, affects, household, s, purchasing, power, the, consumption, decreases, along, with, demand, in, general, which, leads, to, a, decrease, of, activity, however, the, current, account, is, improved, as, imports, are, reduced, with, the, drop, of, domestic, demand, in, the, medium, term, through, the, rise, of, unemployment, gross, salary, and, the, real, labour, cost, progressively, decreases, it, results, in, the, progressive, increase, of, employment, and, thus, the, gradual, decrease, of, unemployment, the, household, s, consumption, prices, decrease, this, shock, is, deflationary, the, competitivity, is, improved, which, lead, to, a, job, creation, and, the, boost, of, economic, activity, the, gdp, increases, and, this, shock, is, therefore, expansionist, administration, s, financing, capacity, improved, in, the, short, term, happens, to, be, limited, in, the, medium, term, indeed, the, drop, of, prices, decreases, the, tax, bases, especially, household, income, specific, comprehensive, employment, and, training, act
