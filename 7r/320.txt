in, articulatory, phonetics, a, consonant, is, a, speech, sound, that, is, articulated, with, complete, or, partial, closure, of, the, vocal, tract, except, for, the, h, sound, which, is, pronounced, without, any, stricture, in, the, vocal, tract, examples, are, and, pronounced, with, the, lips, and, pronounced, with, the, front, of, the, tongue, and, pronounced, with, the, back, of, the, tongue, pronounced, throughout, the, vocal, tract, and, pronounced, by, forcing, air, through, a, narrow, channel, fricatives, and, and, which, have, air, flowing, through, the, nose, nasals, most, consonants, are, pulmonic, using, air, pressure, from, the, lungs, to, generate, a, sound, very, few, natural, languages, are, non, pulmonic, making, use, of, ejectives, implosives, and, clicks, contrasting, with, consonants, are, vowels, since, the, number, of, speech, sounds, in, the, world, s, languages, is, much, greater, than, the, number, of, letters, in, any, one, alphabet, linguists, have, devised, systems, such, as, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, to, assign, a, unique, and, unambiguous, symbol, to, each, attested, consonant, the, english, alphabet, has, fewer, consonant, letters, than, the, english, language, has, consonant, sounds, so, digraphs, like, ch, sh, th, and, ng, are, used, to, extend, the, alphabet, though, some, letters, and, digraphs, represent, more, than, one, consonant, for, example, the, sound, spelled, th, in, this, is, a, different, consonant, from, the, th, sound, in, thin, in, the, ipa, these, are, and, respectively, the, word, consonant, comes, from, latin, oblique, stem, c, nsonant, from, c, nson, ns, sounding, together, a, calque, of, greek, s, mph, non, plural, s, mph, na, dionysius, thrax, calls, consonants, s, mph, na, sounded, with, because, in, greek, they, can, only, be, pronounced, with, a, vowel, he, divides, them, into, two, subcategories, h, m, ph, na, half, sounded, which, are, the, continuants, and, ph, na, unsounded, which, correspond, to, plosives, this, description, does, not, apply, to, some, languages, such, as, the, salishan, languages, in, which, plosives, may, occur, without, vowels, see, nuxalk, and, the, modern, concept, of, consonant, does, not, require, co, occurrence, with, a, vowel, the, word, consonant, may, be, used, ambiguously, for, both, speech, sounds, and, the, letters, of, the, alphabet, used, to, write, them, in, english, these, letters, are, b, c, d, f, g, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, s, t, v, x, z, and, often, h, r, w, y, in, english, orthography, the, letters, h, r, w, y, and, the, digraph, gh, are, used, for, both, consonants, and, vowels, for, instance, the, letter, y, stands, for, the, consonant, semi, vowel, j, in, y, oke, the, vowel, in, m, y, th, the, vowel, i, in, funn, y, the, diphthong, a, in, sk, y, and, forms, several, digraphs, for, other, diphthongs, such, as, sa, y, bo, y, ke, y, similarly, r, commonly, indicates, or, modifies, a, vowel, in, non, rhotic, accents, this, article, is, concerned, with, consonant, sounds, however, they, are, written, consonants, and, vowels, correspond, to, distinct, parts, of, a, syllable, the, most, sonorous, part, of, the, syllable, that, is, the, part, that, is, easiest, to, sing, called, the, syllabic, peak, or, nucleus, is, typically, a, vowel, while, the, less, sonorous, margins, called, the, onset, and, coda, are, typically, consonants, such, syllables, may, be, abbreviated, cv, v, and, cvc, where, c, stands, for, consonant, and, v, stands, for, vowel, this, can, be, argued, to, be, the, only, pattern, found, in, most, of, the, world, s, languages, and, perhaps, the, primary, pattern, in, all, of, them, however, the, distinction, between, consonant, and, vowel, is, not, always, clear, cut, there, are, syllabic, consonants, and, non, syllabic, vowels, in, many, of, the, world, s, languages, one, blurry, area, is, in, segments, variously, called, semivowels, semiconsonants, or, glides, on, one, side, there, are, vowel, like, segments, that, are, not, in, themselves, syllabic, but, form, diphthongs, as, part, of, the, syllable, nucleus, as, the, i, in, english, boil, on, the, other, there, are, approximants, that, behave, like, consonants, in, forming, onsets, but, are, articulated, very, much, like, vowels, as, the, y, in, english, yes, some, phonologists, model, these, as, both, being, the, underlying, vowel, i, so, that, the, english, word, bit, would, phonemically, be, bit, beet, would, be, bii, t, and, yield, would, be, phonemically, i, ii, ld, likewise, foot, would, be, fut, food, would, be, fuu, d, wood, would, be, u, ud, and, wooed, would, be, u, uu, d, however, there, is, a, perhaps, allophonic, difference, in, articulation, between, these, segments, with, the, in, yes, and, yield, and, the, of, wooed, having, more, constriction, and, a, more, definite, place, of, articulation, than, the, in, boil, or, bit, or, the, of, foot, the, other, problematic, area, is, that, of, syllabic, consonants, segments, articulated, as, consonants, but, occupying, the, nucleus, of, a, syllable, this, may, be, the, case, for, words, such, as, church, in, rhotic, dialects, of, english, although, phoneticians, differ, in, whether, they, consider, this, to, be, a, syllabic, consonant, t, t, or, a, rhotic, vowel, t, t, some, distinguish, an, approximant, that, corresponds, to, a, vowel, for, rural, as, l, or, others, see, these, as, a, single, phoneme, l, other, languages, use, fricative, and, often, trilled, segments, as, syllabic, nuclei, as, in, czech, and, several, languages, in, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, china, including, mandarin, chinese, in, mandarin, they, are, historically, allophones, of, i, and, spelled, that, way, in, pinyin, ladefoged, and, maddieson, call, these, fricative, vowels, and, say, that, they, can, usually, be, thought, of, as, syllabic, fricatives, that, are, allophones, of, vowels, that, is, phonetically, they, are, consonants, but, phonemically, they, behave, as, vowels, many, slavic, languages, allow, the, trill, and, the, lateral, as, syllabic, nuclei, see, words, without, vowels, in, languages, like, nuxalk, it, is, difficult, to, know, what, the, nucleus, of, a, syllable, is, or, if, all, syllables, even, have, nuclei, if, the, concept, of, syllable, applies, in, nuxalk, there, are, syllabic, consonants, in, words, like, sx, s, s, xs, seal, fat, miyako, in, japan, is, similar, with, f, ks, to, build, and, ps, ks, to, pull, each, spoken, consonant, can, be, distinguished, by, several, phonetic, features, all, english, consonants, can, be, classified, by, a, combination, of, these, features, such, as, voiceless, alveolar, stop, in, this, case, the, airstream, mechanism, is, omitted, some, pairs, of, consonants, like, p, b, t, d, are, sometimes, called, fortis, and, lenis, but, this, is, a, phonological, rather, than, phonetic, distinction, consonants, are, scheduled, by, their, features, in, a, number, of, ipa, charts, symbols, to, the, right, in, a, cell, are, voiced, to, the, left, are, voiceless, shaded, areas, denote, articulations, judged, impossible, the, recently, extinct, ubykh, language, had, only, 2, or, 3, vowels, but, 84, consonants, the, taa, language, has, 87, consonants, under, one, analysis, 164, under, another, plus, some, 30, vowels, and, tone, the, types, of, consonants, used, in, various, languages, are, by, no, means, universal, for, instance, nearly, all, australian, languages, lack, fricatives, a, large, percentage, of, the, world, s, languages, lack, voiced, stops, such, as, b, d, as, phonemes, though, they, may, appear, phonetically, most, languages, however, do, include, one, or, more, fricatives, with, s, being, the, most, common, and, a, liquid, consonant, or, two, with, l, the, most, common, the, approximant, w, is, also, widespread, and, virtually, all, languages, have, one, or, more, nasals, though, a, very, few, such, as, the, central, dialect, of, rotokas, lack, even, these, this, last, language, has, the, smallest, number, of, consonants, in, the, world, with, just, six, in, rhotic, american, english, the, consonants, spoken, most, frequently, are, n, t, is, less, common, in, non, rhotic, accents, the, most, frequent, consonant, in, many, other, languages, is, p, the, most, universal, consonants, around, the, world, that, is, the, ones, appearing, in, nearly, all, languages, are, the, three, voiceless, stops, p, t, k, and, the, two, nasals, m, n, however, even, these, common, five, are, not, completely, universal, several, languages, in, the, vicinity, of, the, sahara, desert, including, arabic, lack, p, several, languages, of, north, america, such, as, mohawk, lack, both, of, the, labials, p, and, m, the, wichita, language, of, oklahoma, and, some, west, african, languages, such, as, ijo, lack, the, consonant, n, on, a, phonemic, level, but, do, use, it, phonetically, as, an, allophone, of, another, consonant, of, l, in, the, case, of, ijo, and, of, in, wichita, a, few, languages, on, bougainville, island, and, around, puget, sound, such, as, makah, lack, both, of, the, nasals, and, altogether, except, in, special, speech, registers, such, as, baby, talk, the, click, language, n, ng, lacks, t, and, colloquial, samoan, lacks, both, alveolars, t, and, n, despite, the, 80, odd, consonants, of, ubykh, it, lacks, the, plain, velar, k, in, native, words, as, do, the, related, adyghe, and, kabardian, languages, but, with, a, few, striking, exceptions, such, as, xavante, and, tahitian, which, have, no, dorsal, consonants, whatsoever, nearly, all, other, languages, have, at, least, one, velar, consonant, most, of, the, few, languages, that, do, not, have, a, simple, k, that, is, a, sound, that, is, generally, pronounced, have, a, consonant, that, is, very, similar, for, instance, an, areal, feature, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, is, that, historical, k, has, become, palatalized, in, many, languages, so, that, saanich, for, example, has, t, and, k, but, no, plain, k, similarly, historical, k, in, the, northwest, caucasian, languages, became, palatalized, to, k, in, extinct, ubykh, and, to, t, in, most, circassian, dialects, symbols, to, the, right, in, a, cell, are, voiced, to, the, left, are, voiceless, shaded, areas, denote, articulations, judged, impossible, legend, unrounded, rounded
