investment, is, traditionally, defined, as, the, commitment, of, resources, to, achieve, later, benefits, if, an, investment, involves, money, then, it, can, be, defined, as, a, commitment, of, money, to, receive, more, money, later, from, a, broader, viewpoint, an, investment, can, be, defined, as, to, tailor, the, pattern, of, expenditure, and, receipt, of, resources, to, optimise, the, desirable, patterns, of, these, flows, when, expenditures, and, receipts, are, defined, in, terms, of, money, then, the, net, monetary, receipt, in, a, time, period, is, termed, cash, flow, while, money, received, in, a, series, of, several, time, periods, is, termed, cash, flow, stream, in, finance, the, purpose, of, investing, is, to, generate, a, return, on, the, invested, asset, the, return, may, consist, of, a, capital, gain, profit, or, loss, realised, if, the, investment, is, sold, unrealised, capital, appreciation, or, depreciation, if, yet, unsold, it, may, also, consist, of, periodic, income, such, as, dividends, interest, or, rental, income, the, return, may, also, include, currency, gains, or, losses, due, to, changes, in, foreign, currency, exchange, rates, investors, generally, expect, higher, returns, from, riskier, investments, when, a, low, risk, investment, is, made, the, return, is, also, generally, low, similarly, high, risk, comes, with, a, chance, of, high, losses, investors, particularly, novices, are, often, advised, to, diversify, their, portfolio, diversification, has, the, statistical, effect, of, reducing, overall, risk, in, modern, economies, traditional, investments, include, alternative, investments, include, an, investor, may, bear, a, risk, of, loss, of, some, or, all, of, their, capital, invested, investment, differs, from, arbitrage, in, which, profit, is, generated, without, investing, capital, or, bearing, risk, savings, bear, the, normally, remote, risk, that, the, financial, provider, may, default, foreign, currency, savings, also, bear, foreign, exchange, risk, if, the, currency, of, a, savings, account, differs, from, the, account, holder, s, home, currency, then, there, is, the, risk, that, the, exchange, rate, between, the, two, currencies, will, move, unfavourably, so, that, the, value, of, the, savings, account, decreases, measured, in, the, account, holder, s, home, currency, even, investing, in, tangible, assets, like, property, has, its, risk, and, similar, to, most, risks, property, buyers, can, seek, to, mitigate, any, potential, risk, by, taking, out, mortgage, and, by, borrowing, at, a, lower, loan, to, security, ratio, in, contrast, with, savings, investments, tend, to, carry, more, risk, in, the, form, of, both, a, wider, variety, of, risk, factors, and, a, greater, level, of, uncertainty, industry, to, industry, volatility, is, more, or, less, of, a, risk, depending, in, biotechnology, for, example, investors, look, for, big, profits, on, companies, that, have, small, market, capitalizations, but, can, be, worth, hundreds, of, millions, quite, quickly, the, risk, is, high, because, approximately, 90, of, biotechnology, products, researched, do, not, make, it, to, market, due, to, regulations, and, the, complex, demands, within, pharmacology, as, the, average, prescription, drug, takes, 10, years, and, us, 2, 5, billion, worth, of, capital, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, the, qirad, was, a, major, financial, instrument, this, was, an, arrangement, between, one, or, more, investors, and, an, agent, where, the, investors, entrusted, capital, to, an, agent, who, then, traded, with, it, in, hopes, of, making, a, profit, both, parties, then, received, a, previously, settled, portion, of, the, profit, though, the, agent, was, not, liable, for, any, losses, many, will, notice, that, the, qirad, is, similar, to, the, institution, of, the, commenda, later, used, in, western, europe, though, whether, the, qirad, transformed, into, the, commenda, or, the, two, institutions, evolved, independently, cannot, be, stated, with, certainty, in, the, early, 1900s, purchasers, of, stocks, bonds, and, other, securities, were, described, in, media, academia, and, commerce, as, speculators, since, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, and, particularly, by, the, 1950s, the, term, investment, had, come, to, denote, the, more, conservative, end, of, the, securities, spectrum, while, speculation, was, applied, by, financial, brokers, and, their, advertising, agencies, to, higher, risk, securities, much, in, vogue, at, that, time, since, the, last, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, terms, speculation, and, speculator, have, specifically, referred, to, higher, risk, ventures, a, value, investor, buys, assets, that, they, believe, to, be, undervalued, and, sells, overvalued, ones, to, identify, undervalued, securities, a, value, investor, uses, analysis, of, the, financial, reports, of, the, issuer, to, evaluate, the, security, value, investors, employ, accounting, ratios, such, as, earnings, per, share, and, sales, growth, to, identify, securities, trading, at, prices, below, their, worth, warren, buffett, and, benjamin, graham, are, notable, examples, of, value, investors, graham, and, dodd, s, seminal, work, security, analysis, was, written, in, the, wake, of, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, the, price, to, earnings, ratio, p, e, or, earnings, multiple, is, a, particularly, significant, and, recognized, fundamental, ratio, with, a, function, of, dividing, the, share, price, of, the, stock, by, its, earnings, per, share, this, will, provide, the, value, representing, the, sum, investors, are, prepared, to, expend, for, each, dollar, of, company, earnings, this, ratio, is, an, important, aspect, due, to, its, capacity, as, measurement, for, the, comparison, of, valuations, of, various, companies, a, stock, with, a, lower, p, e, ratio, will, cost, less, per, share, than, one, with, a, higher, p, e, taking, into, account, the, same, level, of, financial, performance, therefore, it, essentially, means, a, low, p, e, is, the, preferred, option, an, instance, in, which, the, price, to, earnings, ratio, has, a, lesser, significance, is, when, companies, in, different, industries, are, compared, for, example, although, it, is, reasonable, for, a, telecommunications, stock, to, show, a, p, e, in, the, low, teens, in, the, case, of, hi, tech, stock, a, p, e, in, the, 40s, range, is, not, unusual, when, making, comparisons, the, p, e, ratio, can, give, you, a, refined, view, of, a, particular, stock, valuation, for, investors, paying, for, each, dollar, of, a, company, s, earnings, the, p, e, ratio, is, a, significant, indicator, but, the, price, to, book, ratio, p, b, is, also, a, reliable, indication, of, how, much, investors, are, willing, to, spend, on, each, dollar, of, company, assets, in, the, process, of, the, p, b, ratio, the, share, price, of, a, stock, is, divided, by, its, net, assets, any, intangibles, such, as, goodwill, are, not, taken, into, account, it, is, a, crucial, factor, of, the, price, to, book, ratio, due, to, it, indicating, the, actual, payment, for, tangible, assets, and, not, the, more, difficult, valuation, of, intangibles, accordingly, the, p, b, could, be, considered, a, comparatively, conservative, metric, growth, investors, seek, investments, they, believe, are, likely, to, have, higher, earnings, or, greater, value, in, the, future, to, identify, such, stocks, growth, investors, often, evaluate, measures, of, current, stock, value, as, well, as, predictions, of, future, financial, performance, growth, investors, seek, profits, through, capital, appreciation, the, gains, earned, when, a, stock, is, sold, at, a, higher, price, than, what, it, was, purchased, for, the, price, to, earnings, p, e, multiple, is, also, used, for, this, type, of, investment, growth, stock, are, likely, to, have, a, p, e, higher, than, others, in, its, industry, according, to, investopedia, author, troy, segal, and, u, s, department, of, state, fulbright, fintech, research, awardee, julius, mansa, growth, investing, is, best, suited, for, investors, who, prefer, relatively, shorter, investment, horizons, higher, risks, and, are, not, seeking, immediate, cash, flow, through, dividends, some, investors, attribute, the, introduction, of, the, growth, investing, strategy, to, investment, banker, thomas, rowe, price, jr, who, tested, and, popularized, the, method, in, 1950, by, introducing, his, mutual, fund, the, t, rowe, price, growth, stock, fund, price, asserted, that, investors, could, reap, high, returns, by, investing, in, companies, that, are, well, managed, in, fertile, fields, a, new, form, of, investing, that, seems, to, have, caught, the, attention, of, investors, is, venture, capital, venture, capital, is, independently, managed, dedicated, pools, of, capital, that, focus, on, equity, or, equity, linked, investments, in, privately, held, high, growth, companies, momentum, investors, generally, seek, to, buy, stocks, that, are, currently, experiencing, a, short, term, uptrend, and, they, usually, sell, them, once, this, momentum, starts, to, decrease, stocks, or, securities, purchased, for, momentum, investing, are, often, characterized, by, demonstrating, consistently, high, returns, for, the, past, three, to, twelve, months, however, in, a, bear, market, momentum, investing, also, involves, short, selling, securities, of, stocks, that, are, experiencing, a, downward, trend, because, it, is, believed, that, these, stocks, will, continue, to, decrease, in, value, essentially, momentum, investing, generally, relies, on, the, principle, that, a, consistently, up, trending, stock, will, continue, to, grow, while, a, consistently, down, trending, stock, will, continue, to, fall, economists, and, financial, analysts, have, not, reached, a, consensus, on, the, effectiveness, of, using, the, momentum, investing, strategy, rather, than, evaluating, a, company, s, operational, performance, momentum, investors, instead, utilize, trend, lines, moving, averages, and, the, average, directional, index, adx, to, determine, the, existence, and, strength, of, trends, dollar, cost, averaging, dca, also, known, in, the, uk, as, pound, cost, averaging, is, the, process, of, consistently, investing, a, certain, amount, of, money, across, regular, increments, of, time, and, the, method, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, value, investing, growth, investing, momentum, investing, or, other, strategies, for, example, an, investor, who, practices, dollar, cost, averaging, could, choose, to, invest, 200, a, month, for, the, next, 3, years, regardless, of, the, share, price, of, their, preferred, stock, s, mutual, funds, or, exchange, traded, funds, many, investors, believe, that, dollar, cost, averaging, helps, minimize, short, term, volatility, by, spreading, risk, out, across, time, intervals, and, avoiding, market, timing, research, also, shows, that, dca, can, help, reduce, the, total, average, cost, per, share, in, an, investment, because, the, method, enables, the, purchase, of, more, shares, when, their, price, is, lower, and, less, shares, when, the, price, is, higher, however, dollar, cost, averaging, is, also, generally, characterized, by, more, brokerage, fees, which, could, decrease, an, investor, s, overall, returns, the, term, dollar, cost, averaging, is, believed, to, have, first, been, coined, in, 1949, by, economist, and, author, benjamin, graham, in, his, book, the, intelligent, investor, graham, asserted, that, investors, that, use, dca, are, likely, to, end, up, with, a, satisfactory, overall, price, for, all, holdings, micro, investing, is, a, type, of, investment, strategy, that, is, designed, to, make, investing, regular, accessible, and, affordable, especially, for, those, who, may, not, have, a, lot, of, money, to, invest, or, who, are, new, to, investing, investments, are, often, made, indirectly, through, intermediary, financial, institutions, these, intermediaries, include, pension, funds, banks, and, insurance, companies, they, may, pool, money, received, from, a, number, of, individual, end, investors, into, funds, such, as, investment, trusts, unit, trusts, and, sicavs, to, make, large, scale, investments, each, individual, investor, holds, an, indirect, or, direct, claim, on, the, assets, purchased, subject, to, charges, levied, by, the, intermediary, which, may, be, large, and, varied, approaches, to, investment, sometimes, referred, to, in, marketing, of, collective, investments, include, dollar, cost, averaging, and, market, timing, free, cash, flow, measures, the, cash, a, company, generates, which, is, available, to, its, debt, and, equity, investors, after, allowing, for, reinvestment, in, working, capital, and, capital, expenditure, high, and, rising, free, cash, flow, therefore, tend, to, make, a, company, more, attractive, to, investors, the, debt, to, equity, ratio, is, an, indicator, of, capital, structure, a, high, proportion, of, debt, reflected, in, a, high, debt, to, equity, ratio, tends, to, make, a, company, s, earnings, free, cash, flow, and, ultimately, the, returns, to, its, investors, riskier, or, volatile, investors, compare, a, company, s, debt, to, equity, ratio, with, those, of, other, companies, in, the, same, industry, and, examine, trends, in, debt, to, equity, ratios, and, free, cashflow
