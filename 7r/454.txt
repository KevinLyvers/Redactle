middle, chinese, layer, lexical, connections, between, hakka, kra, dai, and, hmong, mien, have, also, been, suggested, by, deng, 1999, due, to, the, migration, of, its, speakers, hakka, may, have, been, influenced, by, other, language, areas, through, which, the, hakka, speaking, forebears, migrated, for, instance, common, vocabulary, is, found, in, hakka, min, and, the, she, hmong, mien, languages, today, most, she, people, in, fujian, and, zhejiang, speak, she, which, is, closely, related, to, hakka, a, regular, pattern, of, sound, change, can, generally, be, detected, in, hakka, as, in, most, chinese, varieties, of, the, derivation, of, phonemes, from, earlier, forms, of, chinese, some, examples, hakka, has, as, many, regional, dialects, as, there, are, counties, with, hakka,
