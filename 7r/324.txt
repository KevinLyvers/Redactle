phonology, is, the, branch, of, linguistics, that, studies, how, languages, systematically, organize, their, phones, or, for, sign, languages, their, constituent, parts, of, signs, the, term, can, also, refer, specifically, to, the, sound, or, sign, system, of, a, particular, language, variety, at, one, time, the, study, of, phonology, related, only, to, the, study, of, the, systems, of, phonemes, in, spoken, languages, but, may, now, relate, to, any, linguistic, analysis, either, sign, languages, have, a, phonological, system, equivalent, to, the, system, of, sounds, in, spoken, languages, the, building, blocks, of, signs, are, specifications, for, movement, location, and, handshape, at, first, a, separate, terminology, was, used, for, the, study, of, sign, phonology, chereme, instead, of, phoneme, etc, but, the, concepts, are, now, considered, to, apply, universally, to, all, human, languages, the, word, phonology, as, in, phonology, of, english, can, refer, either, to, the, field, of, study, or, to, the, phonological, system, of, a, given, language, this, is, one, of, the, fundamental, systems, that, a, language, is, considered, to, comprise, like, its, syntax, its, morphology, and, its, lexicon, the, word, phonology, comes, from, ancient, greek, ph, n, voice, sound, and, the, suffix, logy, which, is, from, greek, l, gos, word, speech, subject, of, discussion, phonology, is, typically, distinguished, from, phonetics, which, concerns, the, physical, production, acoustic, transmission, and, perception, of, the, sounds, or, signs, of, language, phonology, describes, the, way, they, function, within, a, given, language, or, across, languages, to, encode, meaning, for, many, linguists, phonetics, belongs, to, descriptive, linguistics, and, phonology, to, theoretical, linguistics, but, establishing, the, phonological, system, of, a, language, is, necessarily, an, application, of, theoretical, principles, to, analysis, of, phonetic, evidence, in, some, theories, the, distinction, was, not, always, made, particularly, before, the, development, of, the, modern, concept, of, the, phoneme, in, the, mid, 20th, century, some, subfields, of, modern, phonology, have, a, crossover, with, phonetics, in, descriptive, disciplines, such, as, psycholinguistics, and, speech, perception, which, result, in, specific, areas, like, articulatory, phonology, or, laboratory, phonology, definitions, of, the, field, of, phonology, vary, nikolai, trubetzkoy, in, grundz, ge, der, phonologie, 1939, defines, phonology, as, the, study, of, sound, pertaining, to, the, system, of, language, as, opposed, to, phonetics, which, is, the, study, of, sound, pertaining, to, the, act, of, speech, the, distinction, between, language, and, speech, being, basically, ferdinand, de, saussure, s, distinction, between, langue, and, parole, more, recently, lass, 1998, writes, that, phonology, refers, broadly, to, the, subdiscipline, of, linguistics, concerned, with, the, sounds, of, language, and, in, more, narrow, terms, phonology, proper, is, concerned, with, the, function, behavior, and, organization, of, sounds, as, linguistic, items, according, to, clark, et, al, 2007, it, means, the, systematic, use, of, sound, to, encode, meaning, in, any, spoken, human, language, or, the, field, of, linguistics, studying, that, use, early, evidence, for, a, systematic, study, of, the, sounds, in, a, language, appears, in, the, 4th, century, bce, ashtadhyayi, a, sanskrit, grammar, composed, by, p, ini, in, particular, the, shiva, sutras, an, auxiliary, text, to, the, ashtadhyayi, introduces, what, may, be, considered, a, list, of, the, phonemes, of, sanskrit, with, a, notational, system, for, them, that, is, used, throughout, the, main, text, which, deals, with, matters, of, morphology, syntax, and, semantics, ibn, jinni, of, mosul, a, pioneer, in, phonology, wrote, prolifically, in, the, 10th, century, on, arabic, morphology, and, phonology, in, works, such, as, kit, b, al, mun, if, kit, b, al, mu, tasab, and, kit, b, al, kha, i, the, study, of, phonology, as, it, exists, today, is, defined, by, the, formative, studies, of, the, 19th, century, polish, scholar, jan, baudouin, de, courtenay, 17, who, together, with, his, students, miko, aj, kruszewski, and, lev, shcherba, in, the, kazan, school, shaped, the, modern, usage, of, the, term, phoneme, in, a, series, of, lectures, in, 1876, 1877, the, word, phoneme, had, been, coined, a, few, years, earlier, in, 1873, by, the, french, linguist, a, dufriche, desgenettes, in, a, paper, read, at, 24, may, meeting, of, the, soci, t, de, linguistique, de, paris, dufriche, desgenettes, proposed, for, phoneme, to, serve, as, a, one, word, equivalent, for, the, german, sprachlaut, baudouin, de, courtenay, s, subsequent, work, though, often, unacknowledged, is, considered, to, be, the, starting, point, of, modern, phonology, he, also, worked, on, the, theory, of, phonetic, alternations, what, is, now, called, allophony, and, morphophonology, and, may, have, had, an, influence, on, the, work, of, saussure, according, to, e, f, k, koerner, an, influential, school, of, phonology, in, the, interwar, period, was, the, prague, school, one, of, its, leading, members, was, prince, nikolai, trubetzkoy, whose, grundz, ge, der, phonologie, principles, of, phonology, published, posthumously, in, 1939, is, among, the, most, important, works, in, the, field, from, that, period, directly, influenced, by, baudouin, de, courtenay, trubetzkoy, is, considered, the, founder, of, morphophonology, but, the, concept, had, also, been, recognized, by, de, courtenay, trubetzkoy, also, developed, the, concept, of, the, archiphoneme, another, important, figure, in, the, prague, school, was, roman, jakobson, one, of, the, most, prominent, linguists, of, the, 20th, century, louis, hjelmslev, s, glossematics, also, contributed, with, a, focus, on, linguistic, structure, independent, of, phonetic, realization, or, semantics, 175, in, 1968, noam, chomsky, and, morris, halle, published, the, sound, pattern, of, english, spe, the, basis, for, generative, phonology, in, that, view, phonological, representations, are, sequences, of, segments, made, up, of, distinctive, features, the, features, were, an, expansion, of, earlier, work, by, roman, jakobson, gunnar, fant, and, morris, halle, the, features, describe, aspects, of, articulation, and, perception, are, from, a, universally, fixed, set, and, have, the, binary, values, or, there, are, at, least, two, levels, of, representation, underlying, representation, and, surface, phonetic, representation, ordered, phonological, rules, govern, how, underlying, representation, is, transformed, into, the, actual, pronunciation, the, so, called, surface, form, an, important, consequence, of, the, influence, spe, had, on, phonological, theory, was, the, downplaying, of, the, syllable, and, the, emphasis, on, segments, furthermore, the, generativists, folded, morphophonology, into, phonology, which, both, solved, and, created, problems, natural, phonology, is, a, theory, based, on, the, publications, of, its, proponent, david, stampe, in, 1969, and, more, explicitly, in, 1979, in, this, view, phonology, is, based, on, a, set, of, universal, phonological, processes, that, interact, with, one, another, those, that, are, active, and, those, that, are, suppressed, is, language, specific, rather, than, acting, on, segments, phonological, processes, act, on, distinctive, features, within, prosodic, groups, prosodic, groups, can, be, as, small, as, a, part, of, a, syllable, or, as, large, as, an, entire, utterance, phonological, processes, are, unordered, with, respect, to, each, other, and, apply, simultaneously, but, the, output, of, one, process, may, be, the, input, to, another, the, second, most, prominent, natural, phonologist, is, patricia, donegan, stampe, s, wife, there, are, many, natural, phonologists, in, europe, and, a, few, in, the, us, such, as, geoffrey, nathan, the, principles, of, natural, phonology, were, extended, to, morphology, by, wolfgang, u, dressler, who, founded, natural, morphology, in, 1976, john, goldsmith, introduced, autosegmental, phonology, phonological, phenomena, are, no, longer, seen, as, operating, on, one, linear, sequence, of, segments, called, phonemes, or, feature, combinations, but, rather, as, involving, some, parallel, sequences, of, features, that, reside, on, multiple, tiers, autosegmental, phonology, later, evolved, into, feature, geometry, which, became, the, standard, theory, of, representation, for, theories, of, the, organization, of, phonology, as, different, as, lexical, phonology, and, optimality, theory, government, phonology, which, originated, in, the, early, 1980s, as, an, attempt, to, unify, theoretical, notions, of, syntactic, and, phonological, structures, is, based, on, the, notion, that, all, languages, necessarily, follow, a, small, set, of, principles, and, vary, according, to, their, selection, of, certain, binary, parameters, that, is, all, languages, phonological, structures, are, essentially, the, same, but, there, is, restricted, variation, that, accounts, for, differences, in, surface, realizations, principles, are, held, to, be, inviolable, but, parameters, may, sometimes, come, into, conflict, prominent, figures, in, this, field, include, jonathan, kaye, jean, lowenstamm, jean, roger, vergnaud, monik, charette, and, john, harris, in, a, course, at, the, lsa, summer, institute, in, 1991, alan, prince, and, paul, smolensky, developed, optimality, theory, an, overall, architecture, for, phonology, according, to, which, languages, choose, a, pronunciation, of, a, word, that, best, satisfies, a, list, of, constraints, ordered, by, importance, a, lower, ranked, constraint, can, be, violated, when, the, violation, is, necessary, in, order, to, obey, a, higher, ranked, constraint, the, approach, was, soon, extended, to, morphology, by, john, mccarthy, and, alan, prince, and, has, become, a, dominant, trend, in, phonology, the, appeal, to, phonetic, grounding, of, constraints, and, representational, elements, e, g, features, in, various, approaches, has, been, criticized, by, proponents, of, substance, free, phonology, especially, by, mark, hale, and, charles, reiss, an, integrated, approach, to, phonological, theory, that, combines, synchronic, and, diachronic, accounts, to, sound, patterns, was, initiated, with, evolutionary, phonology, in, recent, years, an, important, part, of, traditional, pre, generative, schools, of, phonology, is, studying, which, sounds, can, be, grouped, into, distinctive, units, within, a, language, these, units, are, known, as, phonemes, for, example, in, english, the, p, sound, in, pot, is, aspirated, pronounced, while, that, in, spot, is, not, aspirated, pronounced, however, english, speakers, intuitively, treat, both, sounds, as, variations, allophones, which, cannot, give, origin, to, minimal, pairs, of, the, same, phonological, category, that, is, of, the, phoneme, p, traditionally, it, would, be, argued, that, if, an, aspirated, were, interchanged, with, the, unaspirated, in, spot, native, speakers, of, english, would, still, hear, the, same, words, that, is, the, two, sounds, are, perceived, as, the, same, p, in, some, other, languages, however, these, two, sounds, are, perceived, as, different, and, they, are, consequently, assigned, to, different, phonemes, for, example, in, thai, bengali, and, quechua, there, are, minimal, pairs, of, words, for, which, aspiration, is, the, only, contrasting, feature, two, words, can, have, different, meanings, but, with, the, only, difference, in, pronunciation, being, that, one, has, an, aspirated, sound, where, the, other, has, an, unaspirated, one, part, of, the, phonological, study, of, a, language, therefore, involves, looking, at, data, phonetic, transcriptions, of, the, speech, of, native, speakers, and, trying, to, deduce, what, the, underlying, phonemes, are, and, what, the, sound, inventory, of, the, language, is, the, presence, or, absence, of, minimal, pairs, as, mentioned, above, is, a, frequently, used, criterion, for, deciding, whether, two, sounds, should, be, assigned, to, the, same, phoneme, however, other, considerations, often, need, to, be, taken, into, account, as, well, the, particular, contrasts, which, are, phonemic, in, a, language, can, change, over, time, at, one, time, and, two, sounds, that, have, the, same, place, and, manner, of, articulation, and, differ, in, voicing, only, were, allophones, of, the, same, phoneme, in, english, but, later, came, to, belong, to, separate, phonemes, this, is, one, of, the, main, factors, of, historical, change, of, languages, as, described, in, historical, linguistics, the, findings, and, insights, of, speech, perception, and, articulation, research, complicate, the, traditional, and, somewhat, intuitive, idea, of, interchangeable, allophones, being, perceived, as, the, same, phoneme, first, interchanged, allophones, of, the, same, phoneme, can, result, in, unrecognizable, words, second, actual, speech, even, at, a, word, level, is, highly, co, articulated, so, it, is, problematic, to, expect, to, be, able, to, splice, words, into, simple, segments, without, affecting, speech, perception, different, linguists, therefore, take, different, approaches, to, the, problem, of, assigning, sounds, to, phonemes, for, example, they, differ, in, the, extent, to, which, they, require, allophones, to, be, phonetically, similar, there, are, also, differing, ideas, as, to, whether, this, grouping, of, sounds, is, purely, a, tool, for, linguistic, analysis, or, reflects, an, actual, process, in, the, way, the, human, brain, processes, a, language, since, the, early, 1960s, theoretical, linguists, have, moved, away, from, the, traditional, concept, of, a, phoneme, preferring, to, consider, basic, units, at, a, more, abstract, level, as, a, component, of, morphemes, these, units, can, be, called, morphophonemes, and, analysis, using, this, approach, is, called, morphophonology, in, addition, to, the, minimal, units, that, can, serve, the, purpose, of, differentiating, meaning, the, phonemes, phonology, studies, how, sounds, alternate, or, replace, one, another, in, different, forms, of, the, same, morpheme, allomorphs, as, well, as, for, example, syllable, structure, stress, feature, geometry, tone, and, intonation, phonology, also, includes, topics, such, as, phonotactics, the, phonological, constraints, on, what, sounds, can, appear, in, what, positions, in, a, given, language, and, phonological, alternation, how, the, pronunciation, of, a, sound, changes, through, the, application, of, phonological, rules, sometimes, in, a, given, order, that, can, be, feeding, or, bleeding, as, well, as, prosody, the, study, of, suprasegmentals, and, topics, such, as, stress, and, intonation, the, principles, of, phonological, analysis, can, be, applied, independently, of, modality, because, they, are, designed, to, serve, as, general, analytical, tools, not, language, specific, ones, the, same, principles, have, been, applied, to, the, analysis, of, sign, languages, see, phonemes, in, sign, languages, even, though, the, sublexical, units, are, not, instantiated, as, speech, sounds
