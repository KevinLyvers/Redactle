the, african, pygmies, or, congo, pygmies, variously, also, central, african, foragers, african, rainforest, hunter, gatherers, rhg, or, forest, people, of, central, africa, are, a, group, of, ethnicities, native, to, central, africa, mostly, the, congo, basin, traditionally, subsisting, on, a, forager, and, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, they, are, divided, into, three, roughly, geographic, groups, they, are, notable, for, and, named, for, their, short, stature, described, as, pygmyism, in, anthropological, literature, they, are, assumed, to, be, descended, from, the, original, middle, stone, age, expansion, of, anatomically, modern, humans, to, central, africa, albeit, substantially, affected, by, later, migrations, from, west, africa, from, their, first, appearance, in, the, historical, record, in, the, 19th, century, limited, to, a, comparatively, small, area, within, central, africa, greatly, decimated, by, the, prehistoric, bantu, expansion, and, to, the, present, time, widely, affected, by, enslavement, at, the, hands, of, neighboring, bantu, ubangian, and, central, sudanic, groups, most, contemporary, pygmy, groups, are, only, partially, foragers, and, partially, trade, with, neighboring, farmers, to, acquire, cultivated, foods, and, other, material, items, no, group, lives, deep, in, the, forest, without, access, to, agricultural, products, a, total, number, of, about, 900, 000, pygmies, were, estimated, to, be, living, in, the, central, african, forests, in, 2016, about, 60, of, this, number, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, the, number, does, not, include, southern, twa, populations, who, live, outside, of, the, central, africa, forest, environment, partly, in, open, swamp, or, desert, environments, additionally, west, african, hunter, gatherers, may, have, dwelled, in, western, central, africa, earlier, than, 32, 000, bp, and, dwelled, in, west, africa, between, 16, 000, bp, and, 12, 000, bp, until, as, late, as, 1000, bp, or, some, period, of, time, after, 1500, ce, west, african, hunter, gatherers, many, of, whom, dwelt, in, the, forest, savanna, region, were, ultimately, acculturated, and, admixed, into, larger, groups, of, west, african, agriculturalists, akin, to, the, migratory, bantu, speaking, agriculturalists, and, their, encounters, with, central, african, hunter, gatherers, the, term, pygmy, as, used, to, refer, to, diminutive, people, derives, from, greek, pygmaios, via, latin, pygmaeus, plural, pygmaei, a, term, for, dwarf, from, greek, mythology, the, word, is, derived, from, pygm, a, term, for, cubit, lit, fist, suggesting, a, diminutive, height, the, use, of, pygmy, in, reference, to, the, small, framed, african, hunter, gatherers, dates, to, the, early, 19th, century, in, english, first, by, john, barrow, travels, into, the, interior, of, southern, africa, 1806, however, the, term, was, used, diffusely, and, treated, as, unsubstantiated, claims, of, dwarf, tribes, among, the, bushmen, of, the, interior, of, africa, until, the, exploration, of, the, congo, basin, in, the, 1860s, two, western, explorers, paul, du, chaillu, and, georg, schweinfurth, claimed, to, have, found, the, mythical, pygmies, a, commentator, wrote, in, 1892, that, thirty, years, ago, viz, in, the, 1860s, nobody, believed, in, the, existence, of, african, dwarf, tribes, and, that, it, needed, an, authority, like, dr, schweinfurth, to, prove, that, pygmies, actually, exist, in, africa, referencing, georg, august, schweinfurth, s, the, heart, of, africa, published, 1873, african, pygmy, is, used, for, disambiguation, from, asiatic, pygmy, a, name, applied, to, the, negrito, populations, of, southeast, asia, dembner, 1996, reported, a, universal, disdain, for, the, term, pygmy, among, the, pygmy, peoples, of, central, africa, the, term, is, considered, a, pejorative, and, people, prefer, to, be, referred, to, by, the, name, of, their, respective, ethnic, or, tribal, groups, such, as, bayaka, mbuti, and, twa, there, is, no, clear, replacement, for, the, term, pygmy, in, reference, to, the, umbrella, group, a, descriptive, term, that, has, seen, some, use, since, the, 2000s, is, central, african, foragers, regional, names, used, collectively, of, the, western, group, of, pygmies, are, bambenga, the, plural, form, of, mbenga, used, in, the, kongo, language, and, bayaka, the, plural, form, of, aka, yaka, used, in, the, central, african, republic, the, congo, pygmy, speak, languages, of, the, niger, congo, and, central, sudanic, language, families, there, has, been, significant, intermixing, between, the, bantu, and, pygmies, there, are, at, least, a, dozen, pygmy, groups, sometimes, unrelated, to, each, other, they, are, grouped, in, three, geographical, categories, african, pygmies, are, often, assumed, to, be, the, direct, descendants, of, the, middle, stone, age, hunter, gatherer, peoples, of, the, central, african, rainforest, genetic, evidence, for, the, deep, separation, of, congo, pygmies, from, the, lineage, of, west, africans, and, east, africans, as, well, as, admixture, from, archaic, humans, was, found, in, the, 2010s, the, lineage, of, african, pygmies, is, strongly, associated, with, mitochondrial, maternal, line, haplogroup, l1, with, a, divergence, time, between, 170, 000, and, 100, 000, years, ago, they, were, partially, absorbed, or, displaced, by, later, immigration, of, agricultural, peoples, of, the, central, sudanic, and, ubangian, phyla, beginning, after, about, 5, 500, years, ago, and, beginning, about, 3, 500, years, ago, by, the, bantu, adopting, their, languages, substantial, non, bantu, and, non, ubangian, substrates, have, been, identified, in, aka, and, in, baka, respectively, on, the, order, of, 30, of, the, lexicon, much, of, this, vocabulary, is, botanical, deals, with, honey, harvesting, or, is, otherwise, specialized, for, the, forest, and, is, shared, between, the, two, western, pygmy, groups, this, substrate, has, been, suggested, as, representing, a, remnant, of, an, ancient, western, pygmy, linguistic, phylum, dubbed, mbenga, or, baaka, however, as, substrate, vocabulary, has, been, widely, borrowed, between, pygmies, and, neighboring, peoples, no, reconstruction, of, such, a, baaka, language, is, possible, for, times, more, remote, than, a, few, centuries, ago, an, ancestral, pygmy, language, has, been, postulated, for, at, least, some, pygmy, groups, based, on, the, observation, of, linguistic, substrates, according, to, merritt, ruhlen, 1994, african, pygmies, speak, languages, belonging, to, either, the, nilo, saharan, or, the, niger, kordofanian, family, it, is, assumed, that, pygmies, once, spoke, their, own, language, s, but, that, through, living, in, symbiosis, with, other, africans, in, prehistorical, times, they, adopted, languages, belonging, to, these, two, families, roger, blench, 1997, 1999, criticized, the, hypothesis, of, an, ancestral, pygmy, language, arguing, that, even, if, there, is, evidence, for, a, common, ancestral, language, rather, than, just, borrowing, it, will, not, be, sufficient, to, establish, a, specifically, pygmy, origin, rather, than, any, of, the, several, potential, language, isolates, of, former, hunter, gatherer, populations, that, ring, the, rainforest, he, argued, that, the, pygmies, do, not, form, the, residue, of, a, single, ancient, stock, of, central, african, hunter, gatherers, but, that, they, are, rather, descended, from, several, neighboring, ethno, linguistic, groups, independently, adapting, to, forest, subsistence, strategies, blench, adduced, the, lack, of, clear, linguistic, and, archaeological, evidence, for, the, antiquity, of, the, african, pygmies, that, the, genetic, evidence, at, the, time, of, his, writing, was, inconclusive, and, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, the, pygmies, having, a, hunting, technology, distinctive, from, that, of, their, neighbors, he, argued, that, the, short, stature, of, pygmy, populations, can, arise, relatively, quickly, in, less, than, a, few, millennia, under, strong, selection, pressures, west, african, hunter, gatherers, may, have, spoken, a, set, of, presently, extinct, sub, saharan, west, african, languages, in, the, northeastern, region, of, nigeria, jalaa, a, language, isolate, may, have, been, a, descending, language, from, the, original, set, s, of, languages, spoken, by, west, african, hunter, gatherers, genetic, studies, have, found, evidence, that, african, pygmies, are, descended, from, the, middle, stone, age, peopling, of, central, africa, with, a, separation, time, from, west, and, east, africans, of, the, order, 130, 000, years, african, pygmies, in, the, historical, period, have, been, significantly, displaced, by, and, assimilated, to, several, waves, of, niger, congo, and, nilo, saharan, speakers, of, the, central, sudanic, ubangian, and, bantu, phyla, genetically, african, pygmies, have, some, key, differences, between, them, and, bantu, peoples, african, pygmies, uniparental, markers, display, the, most, ancient, divergence, from, other, human, groups, among, anatomically, modern, humans, second, only, to, those, displayed, among, some, khoisan, populations, researchers, identified, an, ancestral, and, autochthonous, lineage, of, mtdna, shared, by, pygmies, and, bantus, suggesting, that, both, populations, were, originally, one, and, that, they, started, to, diverge, from, common, ancestors, around, 70, 000, years, ago, after, a, period, of, isolation, during, which, current, phenotype, differences, between, pygmies, and, bantu, farmers, accumulated, pygmy, women, started, marrying, male, bantu, farmers, but, not, the, opposite, this, trend, started, around, 40, 000, years, ago, and, continued, until, several, thousand, years, ago, subsequently, the, pygmy, gene, pool, was, not, enriched, by, external, gene, influxes, mitochondrial, haplogroup, l1c, is, strongly, associated, with, pygmies, especially, with, bambenga, groups, l1c, prevalence, was, variously, reported, as, 100, in, ba, kola, 97, in, aka, ba, benz, l, and, 77, in, biaka, 100, of, the, bedzan, tikar, 97, and, 100, in, the, baka, people, of, gabon, and, cameroon, respectively, 97, in, bakoya, 97, and, 82, in, ba, bongo, mitochondrial, haplogroups, l2a, and, l0a, are, prevalent, among, the, bambuti, patin, et, al, 2009, suggest, two, unique, late, pleistocene, before, 60, 000, years, ago, divergences, from, other, human, populations, and, a, split, between, eastern, and, western, pygmy, groups, about, 20, 000, years, ago, ancient, dna, was, able, to, be, obtained, from, two, shum, laka, foragers, from, the, early, period, of, the, stone, to, metal, age, in, 8000, bp, and, two, shum, laka, foragers, from, the, late, period, of, the, stone, to, metal, age, in, 3000, bp, the, mitochondrial, dna, and, y, chromosome, haplogroups, found, in, the, ancient, shum, laka, foragers, were, sub, saharan, african, haplogroups, two, earlier, shum, laka, foragers, were, of, haplogroup, l0a2a1, broadly, distributed, throughout, modern, african, populations, and, two, later, shum, laka, foragers, were, of, haplogroup, l1c2a1b, distributed, among, both, modern, west, and, central, african, agriculturalists, and, hunter, gatherers, one, earlier, shum, laka, forager, was, of, haplogroup, b, and, one, later, shum, laka, forager, haplogroup, b2b, which, together, as, macrohaplogroup, b, is, distributed, among, modern, central, african, hunter, gatherers, e, g, baka, bakola, biaka, bedzan, the, autosomal, admixture, of, the, four, ancient, shum, laka, forager, children, was, 35, western, central, african, hunter, gatherer, and, 65, basal, west, african, or, an, admixture, composed, of, a, modern, western, central, african, hunter, gatherer, unit, a, modern, west, african, unit, existing, locally, before, 8000, bp, and, a, modern, east, african, west, african, unit, likely, from, further, north, in, the, regions, of, the, sahel, and, sahara, the, two, earlier, shum, laka, foragers, from, 8000, bp, and, two, later, shum, laka, foragers, from, 3000, bp, show, 5000, years, of, population, continuity, in, region, yet, modern, peoples, of, cameroon, are, more, closely, related, to, modern, west, africans, than, to, the, ancient, shum, laka, foragers, modern, cameroonian, hunter, gatherers, while, partly, descended, are, not, largely, descended, from, the, shum, laka, foragers, due, to, the, apparent, absence, of, descent, from, basal, west, africans, the, bantu, expansion, is, hypothesized, to, have, originated, in, a, homeland, of, bantu, speaking, peoples, located, around, western, cameroon, a, part, of, which, shum, laka, is, viewed, as, being, of, importance, in, the, early, period, of, this, expansion, by, 3000, bp, the, bantu, expansion, is, hypothesized, to, have, already, begun, yet, the, sampled, ancient, shum, laka, foragers, two, from, 8000, bp, and, two, from, 3000, bp, show, that, most, modern, niger, congo, speakers, are, greatly, distinct, from, the, ancient, shum, laka, foragers, thus, showing, that, the, ancient, shum, laka, people, were, not, the, ancestral, source, population, of, the, modern, bantu, speaking, peoples, while, southern, african, hunter, gatherers, are, generally, recognized, as, being, the, earliest, divergent, modern, human, group, having, diverged, from, other, groups, around, 250, 000, bp, 200, 000, bp, as, a, result, of, the, sampling, of, the, ancient, shum, laka, foragers, central, african, hunter, gatherers, are, shown, to, have, likely, diverged, at, a, similar, time, if, not, even, earlier, various, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, short, stature, of, african, pygmies, becker, et, al, suggest, african, pygmyism, may, have, evolved, as, an, adaptation, to, the, significantly, lower, average, levels, of, ultraviolet, light, available, beneath, the, canopy, of, rainforest, environments, in, similar, hypothetical, scenarios, because, of, reduced, access, to, sunlight, a, comparatively, smaller, amount, of, anatomically, formulated, vitamin, d, is, produced, resulting, in, restricted, dietary, calcium, uptake, and, subsequently, restricted, bone, growth, and, maintenance, resulting, in, an, overall, population, average, skeletal, mass, near, the, lowest, periphery, of, the, spectrum, among, anatomically, modern, humans, other, proposed, explanations, include, the, potentially, lesser, availability, of, protein, rich, food, sources, in, rainforest, environments, the, often, reduced, soil, calcium, levels, in, rainforest, environments, the, caloric, expenditure, required, to, traverse, rainforest, terrain, insular, dwarfism, as, an, adaptation, to, equatorial, and, tropical, heat, and, humidity, and, pygmyism, as, an, adaptation, associated, with, rapid, reproductive, maturation, under, conditions, of, early, mortality, additional, evidence, suggests, that, when, compared, to, other, sub, saharan, african, populations, african, pygmy, populations, display, unusually, low, levels, of, expression, of, the, genes, encoding, for, human, growth, hormone, and, its, receptor, associated, with, low, serum, levels, of, insulin, like, growth, factor, 1, and, short, stature, a, study, by, price, et, al, provides, insight, into, the, role, genetics, plays, in, the, reduced, stature, of, african, pygmies, e, found, strong, signals, for, selection, in, both, african, pygmy, groups, at, two, genes, involved, in, the, iodide, dependent, thyroid, hormone, pathway, trip4, in, mbuti, pygmies, and, iyd, in, biaka, pygmies, these, observations, suggest, that, the, efe, have, adapted, genetically, to, an, iodine, deficient, diet, we, suggest, that, the, signals, of, recent, positive, selection, that, we, observe, at, trip4, in, mbuti, pygmies, and, iyd, in, biaka, pygmies, may, reflect, such, genetic, adaptations, to, an, iodine, deficient, diet, furthermore, alterations, in, the, thyroid, hormone, pathway, can, cause, short, stature, we, therefore, suggest, that, short, stature, in, these, pygmy, groups, may, have, arisen, as, a, consequence, of, genetic, alterations, in, the, thyroid, hormone, pathway, his, would, suggest, that, short, stature, arose, as, an, indirect, consequence, of, selection, in, response, to, an, iodine, deficient, diet, second, since, different, genes, in, the, thyroid, hormone, pathway, show, signals, of, selection, in, mbuti, vs, biaka, pygmies, this, would, suggest, that, short, stature, arose, independently, in, the, ancestors, of, mbuti, and, biaka, pygmies, and, not, in, a, common, ancestral, population, moreover, most, pygmy, like, groups, around, the, world, dwell, in, tropical, forests, and, hence, are, likely, to, have, iodine, deficient, diets, the, possibility, that, independent, adaptations, to, an, iodine, deficient, diet, might, therefore, have, contributed, to, the, convergent, evolution, of, the, short, stature, phenotype, in, pygmy, like, groups, around, the, world, deserves, further, investigation, the, african, pygmies, are, particularly, known, for, their, vocal, music, usually, characterized, by, dense, contrapuntal, improvisation, simha, arom, says, that, the, level, of, polyphonic, complexity, of, pygmy, music, was, reached, in, europe, in, the, 14th, century, yet, pygmy, culture, is, unwritten, and, ancient, some, pygmy, groups, being, the, first, known, cultures, in, some, areas, of, africa, music, permeates, daily, life, with, songs, for, entertainment, special, events, and, communal, activities, the, pygmie, people, are, known, to, use, an, instrument, called, the, n, dehou, which, is, a, bamboo, flute, the, n, dehou, only, produces, a, single, sound, however, the, person, using, this, instrument, would, wield, their, breath, and, inhale, making, high, pitched, sounds, this, allows, the, individual, to, make, polyrhythmic, music, using, a, one, note, instrument, along, with, the, different, sounds, of, the, breath, and, the, n, dehou, the, musician, may, also, stomp, their, feet, or, tap, on, their, chest, to, add, even, more, dimension, and, complexity, to, the, music, the, n, dehou, was, popularized, by, francis, bebey, a, cameroonian, musical, artist, polyphonic, music, is, found, among, the, aka, baka, and, the, mbuti, but, not, among, the, gyele, kola, or, the, various, groups, of, twa, in, the, republic, of, congo, where, pygmies, are, estimated, to, make, up, between, 1, 2, and, 10, of, the, population, many, pygmies, live, as, slaves, to, bantu, masters, the, nation, is, deeply, stratified, between, these, two, major, ethnic, groups, the, pygmy, slaves, belong, from, birth, to, their, bantu, masters, in, a, relationship, that, the, bantus, call, a, time, honored, tradition, even, though, the, pygmies, are, responsible, for, much, of, the, hunting, fishing, and, manual, labor, in, jungle, villages, pygmies, and, bantus, alike, say, pygmies, are, often, paid, at, the, master, s, whim, in, cigarettes, used, clothing, or, even, nothing, at, all, in, 2022, after, decades, of, facing, these, conditions, and, working, to, get, legal, protections, for, the, pygmies, a, group, of, 45, indigenous, organizations, successfully, petitioned, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, drc, government, and, the, promotion, and, protection, of, the, rights, of, the, indigenous, pygmy, peoples, the, first, legislation, in, the, country, that, recognizes, and, safeguards, the, specific, rights, of, the, indigenous, pygmy, peoples, was, signed, into, law, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, during, the, ituri, conflict, ugandan, backed, rebel, groups, were, accused, by, the, un, of, enslaving, mbutis, to, prospect, for, minerals, and, forage, for, forest, food, with, those, returning, empty, handed, being, killed, and, eaten, in, 2003, sinafasi, makelo, a, representative, of, mbuti, pygmies, told, the, un, s, indigenous, people, s, forum, that, during, the, congo, civil, war, his, people, were, hunted, down, and, eaten, as, though, they, were, game, animals, in, neighboring, north, kivu, province, there, has, been, cannibalism, by, a, death, squad, known, as, les, effaceurs, the, erasers, who, wanted, to, clear, the, land, of, people, to, open, it, up, for, mineral, exploitation, both, sides, of, the, war, regarded, them, as, subhuman, and, some, say, their, flesh, can, confer, magical, powers, makelo, asked, the, un, security, council, to, recognize, cannibalism, as, a, crime, against, humanity, and, an, act, of, genocide, according, to, minority, rights, group, international, there, is, extensive, evidence, of, mass, killings, cannibalism, and, rape, of, pygmies, and, they, have, urged, the, international, criminal, court, to, investigate, a, campaign, of, extermination, against, pygmies, although, they, have, been, targeted, by, virtually, all, the, armed, groups, much, of, the, violence, against, pygmies, is, attributed, to, the, rebel, group, the, movement, for, the, liberation, of, congo, which, is, part, of, the, transitional, government, and, still, controls, much, of, the, north, as, well, as, their, allies, starting, in, 2013, the, pygmy, batwa, people, whom, the, luba, people, often, exploit, and, allegedly, enslave, rose, up, into, militias, such, as, the, perci, militia, in, northern, katanga, province, and, attacked, luba, villages, a, luba, militia, known, as, elements, attacked, back, notably, killing, at, least, 30, people, in, the, vumilia, 1, displaced, people, camp, in, april, 2015, since, the, start, of, the, conflict, hundreds, have, been, killed, and, tens, of, thousands, have, been, displaced, from, their, homes, the, weapons, used, in, the, conflict, are, often, arrows, and, axes, rather, than, guns, ota, benga, was, a, teenage, pygmy, boy, from, the, congo, ota, was, purchased, from, slave, traders, and, was, brought, to, the, united, states, to, be, exhibited, for, his, unique, looks, ota, had, sharpened, teeth, as, a, result, of, the, traditions, of, his, tribe, and, he, was, also, short, in, stature, in, 1906, ota, was, brought, to, the, bronx, zoo, and, exhibited, in, the, monkey, house, ota, was, given, a, bow, and, arrow, for, protection, from, the, animals, after, the, exhibit, was, closed, ota, was, not, able, to, return, home, to, the, congo, he, lived, out, the, rest, of, his, life, in, virginia, until, he, became, depressed, and, died, by, suicide, at, the, age, of, 33, historically, the, pygmy, have, always, been, viewed, as, inferior, by, both, the, village, dwelling, bantu, tribes, and, colonial, authorities, this, has, translated, into, systematic, discrimination, one, early, example, was, the, capture, of, pygmy, children, under, the, auspices, of, the, belgian, colonial, authorities, who, exported, pygmy, children, to, zoos, throughout, europe, including, the, world, s, fair, in, the, united, states, in, 1907, pygmies, are, often, evicted, from, their, land, and, given, the, lowest, paying, jobs, at, a, state, level, pygmies, are, not, considered, citizens, by, most, african, states, and, are, refused, identity, cards, deeds, to, land, health, care, and, education, access, there, are, roughly, 500, 000, pygmies, remaining, in, the, rainforest, of, central, africa, this, population, is, rapidly, decreasing, as, poverty, intermarriage, with, bantu, peoples, westernization, and, deforestation, gradually, destroy, their, way, of, life, and, culture, the, greatest, environmental, problem, the, pygmies, face, is, the, loss, of, their, traditional, homeland, the, tropical, forests, of, central, africa, in, countries, such, as, cameroon, gabon, central, african, republic, and, the, republic, of, congo, this, is, due, to, deforestation, and, the, desire, of, several, governments, in, central, africa, to, evict, the, pygmies, from, their, forest, habitat, in, order, to, profit, from, the, sale, of, hardwood, and, the, resettlement, of, farmers, onto, the, cleared, land, in, some, cases, as, in, rwanda, and, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, this, conflict, is, violent, certain, groups, such, as, the, hutus, of, the, interahamwe, wish, to, eliminate, the, pygmy, and, take, the, resources, of, the, forest, as, a, military, conquest, using, the, resources, of, the, forest, for, military, as, well, as, economic, advancement, since, the, pygmies, rely, on, the, forest, for, their, physical, as, well, as, cultural, survival, as, these, forests, disappear, so, do, the, pygmy, along, with, raja, sheshadri, the, fpcn, global, org, website, conducted, research, on, the, pygmies, the, human, rights, organization, states, that, as, the, forest, has, receded, under, logging, activities, its, original, inhabitants, have, been, pushed, into, populated, areas, to, join, the, formal, economy, working, as, casual, laborers, or, on, commercial, farms, and, being, exposed, to, new, diseases, this, shift, has, brought, them, into, closer, contact, with, neighboring, ethnic, communities, whose, hiv, levels, are, generally, higher, this, has, led, to, the, spread, of, hiv, into, the, pygmy,
