a, blockade, is, the, act, of, actively, preventing, a, country, or, region, from, receiving, or, sending, out, food, supplies, weapons, or, communications, and, sometimes, people, by, military, force, a, blockade, differs, from, an, embargo, or, sanction, which, are, legal, barriers, to, trade, rather, than, physical, barriers, it, is, also, distinct, from, a, siege, in, that, a, blockade, is, usually, directed, at, an, entire, country, or, region, rather, than, a, fortress, or, city, and, the, objective, may, not, always, be, to, conquer, the, area, a, blockading, power, can, seek, to, cut, off, all, maritime, transport, from, and, to, the, blockaded, country, although, stopping, all, land, transport, to, and, from, an, area, may, also, be, considered, a, blockade, blockades, restrict, the, trading, rights, of, neutrals, who, must, submit, for, inspection, for, contraband, which, the, blockading, power, may, define, narrowly, or, broadly, sometimes, including, food, and, medicine, in, the, 20th, century, air, power, has, also, been, used, to, enhance, the, effectiveness, of, blockades, by, halting, air, traffic, within, the, blockaded, airspace, close, patrol, of, hostile, ports, in, order, to, prevent, naval, forces, from, putting, to, sea, is, also, referred, to, as, a, blockade, when, coastal, cities, or, fortresses, were, besieged, from, the, landward, side, the, besiegers, would, often, blockade, the, seaward, side, as, well, most, recently, blockades, have, sometimes, included, cutting, off, electronic, communications, by, jamming, radio, signals, and, severing, undersea, cables, blockades, often, result, in, the, starvation, of, the, civilian, population, notably, during, the, blockade, of, germany, during, world, war, i, and, the, blockade, of, biafra, during, the, nigerian, civil, war, according, to, modern, international, law, blockades, are, an, act, of, war, when, used, as, a, part, of, an, effort, to, starve, the, civilian, population, they, are, illegal, as, part, of, a, war, of, aggression, or, when, used, against, a, civilian, population, instead, of, a, military, target, in, such, case, they, are, a, war, crime, and, potentially, a, crime, against, humanity, although, primitive, naval, blockades, had, been, in, use, for, millennia, the, first, successful, attempts, at, establishing, a, full, naval, blockade, were, made, by, the, british, royal, navy, during, the, seven, years, war, 1754, 1763, against, france, following, the, british, naval, victory, at, quiberon, bay, which, ended, any, immediate, threat, of, a, major, invasion, of, britain, britain, established, a, close, blockade, on, the, french, coast, this, starved, french, ports, of, commerce, weakening, france, s, economy, admiral, edward, hawke, took, command, of, the, blockading, fleet, off, brest, and, extended, the, blockade, to, cover, the, entire, french, atlantic, coast, from, dunkirk, to, bordeaux, and, also, to, marseilles, on, france, s, mediterranean, coast, the, strategic, importance, of, blockade, was, shown, during, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, napoleonic, wars, when, the, royal, navy, successfully, blockaded, france, leading, to, major, economic, disruptions, the, union, blockade, of, southern, ports, was, a, major, factor, in, the, american, civil, war, during, world, war, i, the, allies, blockaded, the, central, powers, depriving, them, of, food, and, other, strategic, materials, germany, s, attempted, u, boat, blockade, caused, some, shortages, in, britain, but, ultimately, failed, this, outcome, was, repeated, in, world, war, ii, naval, strategic, thinkers, such, as, sir, julian, corbett, and, alfred, thayer, mahan, wrote, that, naval, conflicts, were, won, primarily, by, decisive, battles, but, also, by, blockade, a, close, blockade, entails, placing, warships, within, sight, of, the, blockaded, coast, or, port, to, ensure, the, immediate, interception, of, any, ship, entering, or, leaving, it, is, both, the, most, effective, and, the, most, difficult, form, of, blockade, to, implement, difficulties, arise, because, the, blockading, ships, must, remain, continuously, at, sea, exposed, to, storms, and, hardship, usually, far, from, any, support, and, vulnerable, to, sudden, attack, from, the, blockaded, side, whose, ships, may, stay, safe, in, harbor, until, they, choose, to, come, out, in, a, distant, blockade, the, blockaders, stay, well, away, from, the, blockaded, coast, and, try, to, intercept, any, ships, going, in, or, out, this, may, require, more, ships, on, station, but, they, can, usually, operate, closer, to, their, bases, and, are, at, much, less, risk, from, enemy, raids, this, was, almost, impossible, prior, to, the, 16th, century, due, to, the, nature, of, the, ships, used, a, loose, blockade, is, a, close, blockade, where, the, blockading, ships, are, withdrawn, out, of, sight, from, the, coast, behind, the, horizon, but, no, farther, the, object, of, loose, blockade, is, to, lure, the, enemy, into, venturing, out, but, to, stay, close, enough, to, strike, british, admiral, horatio, nelson, applied, a, loose, blockade, at, c, diz, in, 1805, the, franco, spanish, fleet, under, pierre, charles, villeneuve, then, came, out, resulting, in, the, battle, of, trafalgar, until, 1827, blockades, as, part, of, economic, warfare, were, always, a, part, of, a, war, this, changed, when, france, russia, and, britain, came, to, the, aid, of, the, greek, rebels, against, turkey, they, blockaded, the, turkish, occupied, coast, which, led, to, the, battle, of, navarino, war, was, never, declared, however, so, it, is, considered, the, first, pacific, i, e, peaceful, blockade, the, first, truly, pacific, blockade, involving, no, shooting, at, all, was, the, british, blockade, of, the, republic, of, new, granada, in, 1837, established, to, compel, new, granada, to, release, an, imprisoned, british, consul, since, 1945, the, united, nations, security, council, determines, the, legal, status, of, blockades, and, by, article, 42, of, the, un, charter, the, council, can, also, apply, blockades, the, un, charter, allows, for, the, right, of, self, defense, but, requires, that, this, must, be, immediately, reported, to, the, security, council, to, ensure, the, maintenance, of, international, peace, according, to, the, not, ratified, document, san, remo, manual, on, international, law, applicable, to, armed, conflicts, at, sea, 12, june, 1994, a, blockade, is, a, legal, method, of, warfare, at, sea, but, is, governed, by, rules, the, manual, describes, what, can, never, be, contraband, the, blockading, nation, is, free, to, select, anything, else, as, contraband, in, a, list, which, it, must, publish, the, blockading, nation, typically, establishes, a, blockaded, area, of, water, but, any, ship, can, be, inspected, as, soon, as, it, is, established, that, it, is, attempting, to, break, the, blockade, this, inspection, can, occur, inside, the, blockaded, area, or, in, international, waters, but, never, inside, the, territorial, waters, of, a, neutral, nation, a, neutral, ship, must, obey, a, request, to, stop, for, inspection, from, the, blockading, nation, if, the, situation, so, demands, the, blockading, nation, can, request, that, the, ship, divert, to, a, known, place, or, harbour, for, inspection, if, the, ship, does, not, stop, then, the, ship, is, subject, to, capture, if, people, aboard, the, ship, resist, capture, they, can, be, lawfully, attacked, whether, or, not, a, blockade, was, seen, as, lawful, depended, on, the, laws, of, the, nations, whose, trade, was, influenced, by, the, blockade, the, brazilian, blockade, of, r, o, de, la, plata, in, 1826, during, the, cisplatine, war, for, instance, was, considered, lawful, according, to, british, law, but, unlawful, according, to, french, and, american, law, the, latter, two, countries, announced, they, would, actively, defend, their, ships, against, brazilian, blockaders, while, britain, was, forced, to, steer, for, a, peaceful, solution, between, brazil, and, argentina, blockades, depend, on, four, general, factors, blockade, running, is, the, practice, of, delivering, cargo, food, for, example, to, a, blockaded, area, it, has, mainly, been, done, by, ships, called, blockade, runners, across, ports, under, naval, blockade, blockade, runners, were, typically, the, fastest, ships, available, and, often, lightly, armed, and, armored, it, is, now, also, been, done, by, aircraft, forming, airbridges, such, as, over, the, berlin, blockade, after, world, war, ii
