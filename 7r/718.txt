https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy
empathy, is, generally, described, as, the, ability, to, take, on, another, s, perspective, to, understand, feel, and, possibly, share, and, respond, to, their, experience, there, are, more, sometimes, conflicting, definitions, of, empathy, that, include, but, are, not, limited, to, social, cognitive, and, emotional, processes, primarily, concerned, with, understanding, others, often, times, empathy, is, considered, to, be, a, broad, term, and, broken, down, into, more, specific, concepts, and, types, that, include, cognitive, empathy, emotional, or, affective, empathy, somatic, empathy, and, spiritual, empathy, empathy, is, still, a, topic, of, research, the, major, areas, of, research, include, the, development, of, empathy, the, genetics, and, neuroscience, of, empathy, cross, species, empathy, and, the, impairment, of, empathy, some, researchers, have, made, efforts, to, quantify, empathy, through, different, methods, such, as, from, questionnaires, where, participants, can, fill, out, and, then, be, scored, on, their, answers, some, other, research, discusses, the, effects, of, empathy, benefits, and, issues, caused, by, a, lack, of, or, an, abundance, of, empathy, discussions, of, empathy, are, common, in, the, fields, of, ethics, politics, business, medicine, culture, and, fiction, the, english, word, empathy, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, empatheia, meaning, physical, affection, or, passion, that, word, derives, from, en, in, at, and, pathos, passion, or, suffering, theodor, lipps, adapted, the, german, aesthetic, term, einf, hlung, feeling, into, to, psychology, in, 1903, ch, 1, and, edward, b, titchener, translated, einf, hlung, into, english, as, empathy, in, 1909, in, modern, greek, may, mean, depending, on, context, prejudice, malevolence, malice, or, hatred, since, its, introduction, into, the, english, language, empathy, has, had, a, wide, range, of, sometimes, conflicting, definitions, among, both, researchers, and, laypeople, empathy, definitions, encompass, a, broad, range, of, phenomena, including, caring, for, other, people, and, having, a, desire, to, help, them, experiencing, emotions, that, match, another, person, s, discerning, what, another, person, is, thinking, or, feeling, and, making, less, distinct, the, differences, between, the, self, and, the, other, since, empathy, involves, understanding, the, emotional, states, of, other, people, the, way, it, is, characterized, derives, from, the, way, emotions, are, characterized, for, example, if, emotions, are, characterized, by, bodily, feelings, then, understanding, the, bodily, feelings, of, another, will, be, considered, central, to, empathy, on, the, other, hand, if, emotions, are, characterized, by, a, combination, of, beliefs, and, desires, then, understanding, those, beliefs, and, desires, will, be, more, essential, to, empathy, the, ability, to, imagine, oneself, as, another, person, is, a, sophisticated, process, however, the, basic, capacity, to, recognize, emotions, in, others, may, be, innate, and, may, be, achieved, unconsciously, empirical, research, supports, a, variety, of, interventions, to, improve, empathy, empathy, is, not, all, or, nothing, rather, a, person, can, be, more, or, less, empathic, toward, another, paradigmatically, a, person, exhibits, empathy, when, they, communicate, an, accurate, recognition, of, the, significance, of, another, person, s, ongoing, intentional, actions, associated, emotional, states, and, personal, characteristics, in, a, manner, that, seems, accurate, and, tolerable, to, the, recognized, person, this, is, a, nuanced, perspective, on, empathy, which, assists, in, the, understanding, of, complex, human, emotions, and, interactions, acknowledging, subjective, experiences, highlights, the, need, for, balance, and, understanding, when, engaging, in, empathy, one, s, ability, to, recognize, the, bodily, feelings, of, another, is, related, to, one, s, imitative, capacities, and, seems, to, be, grounded, in, an, innate, capacity, to, associate, the, bodily, movements, and, facial, expressions, one, sees, in, another, with, the, proprioceptive, feelings, of, producing, those, corresponding, movements, or, expressions, oneself, because, empathy, is, rooted, in, our, ability, to, imitate, their, painful, experience, people, with, disorders, that, inhibit, them, from, social, understanding, connection, may, experience, difficulty, portraying, empathy, for, others, these, people, could, include, individuals, diagnosed, with, asperger, s, or, autism, compassion, and, sympathy, are, terms, associated, with, empathy, a, person, feels, compassion, when, they, notice, others, are, in, need, and, this, feeling, motivates, that, person, to, help, like, empathy, compassion, has, a, wide, range, of, definitions, and, purported, facets, which, overlap, with, some, definitions, of, empathy, sympathy, is, a, feeling, of, care, and, understanding, for, someone, in, need, some, include, in, sympathy, an, empathic, concern, for, another, person, and, the, wish, to, see, them, better, off, or, happier, empathy, is, also, related, to, pity, and, emotional, contagion, one, feels, pity, towards, others, who, might, be, in, trouble, or, in, need, of, help, this, feeling, is, described, as, feeling, sorry, for, someone, emotional, contagion, is, when, a, person, especially, an, infant, or, a, member, of, a, mob, imitatively, catches, the, emotions, that, others, are, showing, without, necessarily, recognizing, this, is, happening, alexithymia, describes, a, deficiency, in, understanding, processing, or, describing, one, s, own, emotions, unlike, empathy, which, is, about, someone, else, s, emotions, empathy, has, two, major, components, the, scientific, community, has, not, coalesced, around, a, precise, definition, of, these, constructs, but, there, is, consensus, about, this, distinction, affective, and, cognitive, empathy, are, also, independent, from, one, another, someone, who, strongly, empathizes, emotionally, is, not, necessarily, good, in, understanding, another, s, perspective, additional, constructs, that, have, been, proposed, include, behavioral, empathy, which, governs, how, one, chooses, to, respond, to, feelings, of, empathy, social, empathy, in, which, the, empathetic, person, integrates, their, understanding, of, broader, social, dynamics, into, their, empathetic, modeling, and, ecological, empathy, which, encompasses, empathy, directed, towards, the, natural, world, in, addition, fritz, breithaupt, emphasizes, the, importance, of, empathy, suppression, mechanisms, in, healthy, empathy, ch, 2, efforts, to, measure, empathy, go, back, to, at, least, the, mid, twentieth, century, researchers, approach, the, measurement, of, empathy, from, a, number, of, perspectives, behavioral, measures, normally, involve, raters, assessing, the, presence, or, absence, of, certain, behaviors, in, the, subjects, they, are, monitoring, both, verbal, and, non, verbal, behaviors, have, been, captured, on, video, by, experimenters, other, experimenters, required, subjects, to, comment, upon, their, own, feelings, and, behaviors, or, those, of, other, people, involved, in, the, experiment, as, indirect, ways, of, signaling, their, level, of, empathic, functioning, to, the, raters, physiological, responses, tend, to, be, captured, by, elaborate, electronic, equipment, that, has, been, physically, connected, to, the, subject, s, body, researchers, then, draw, inferences, about, that, person, s, empathic, reactions, from, the, electronic, readings, produced, bodily, or, somatic, measures, can, be, seen, as, behavioral, measures, at, a, micro, level, they, measure, empathy, through, facial, and, other, non, verbally, expressed, reactions, such, changes, are, presumably, underpinned, by, physiological, changes, brought, about, by, some, form, of, emotional, contagion, or, mirroring, these, reactions, while, they, appear, to, reflect, the, internal, emotional, state, of, the, empathizer, could, also, if, the, stimulus, incident, lasted, more, than, the, briefest, period, reflect, the, results, of, emotional, reactions, based, on, cognitions, associated, with, role, taking, if, i, were, him, i, would, feel, picture, or, puppet, story, indices, for, empathy, have, been, adopted, to, enable, even, very, young, pre, school, subjects, to, respond, without, needing, to, read, questions, and, write, answers, dependent, variables, variables, that, are, monitored, for, any, change, by, the, experimenter, for, younger, subjects, have, included, self, reporting, on, a, seven, point, smiley, face, scale, and, filmed, facial, reactions, in, some, experiments, subjects, are, required, to, watch, video, scenarios, either, staged, or, authentic, and, to, make, written, responses, which, are, then, assessed, for, their, levels, of, empathy, scenarios, are, sometimes, also, depicted, in, printed, form, measures, of, empathy, also, frequently, require, subjects, to, self, report, upon, their, own, ability, or, capacity, for, empathy, using, likert, style, numerical, responses, to, a, printed, questionnaire, that, may, have, been, designed, to, reveal, the, affective, cognitive, affective, or, largely, cognitive, substrates, of, empathic, functioning, some, questionnaires, claim, to, reveal, both, cognitive, and, affective, substrates, however, a, 2019, meta, analysis, questions, the, validity, of, self, report, measures, of, cognitive, empathy, finding, that, such, self, report, measures, have, negligibly, small, correlations, with, corresponding, behavioral, measures, balancing, subjective, self, perceptions, along, with, observable, behaviors, can, help, to, contribute, to, a, more, reliable, assessment, of, empathy, such, measures, are, also, vulnerable, to, measuring, not, empathy, but, the, difference, between, a, person, s, felt, empathy, and, their, standards, for, how, much, empathy, is, appropriate, for, example, one, researcher, found, that, students, scored, themselves, as, less, empathetic, after, taking, her, empathy, class, after, learning, more, about, empathy, the, students, became, more, exacting, in, how, they, judged, their, own, feelings, and, behavior, expected, more, from, themselves, and, so, rated, themselves, more, severely, in, the, field, of, medicine, a, measurement, tool, for, carers, is, the, jefferson, scale, of, physician, empathy, health, professional, version, jspe, hp, the, interpersonal, reactivity, index, iri, is, among, the, oldest, published, measurement, tools, still, in, frequent, use, first, published, in, 1983, that, provides, a, multi, dimensional, assessment, of, empathy, it, comprises, a, self, report, questionnaire, of, 28, items, divided, into, four, seven, item, scales, covering, the, subdivisions, of, affective, and, cognitive, empathy, described, above, more, recent, self, report, tools, include, the, empathy, quotient, eq, created, by, baron, cohen, and, wheelwright, which, comprises, a, self, report, questionnaire, consisting, of, 60, items, another, multi, dimensional, scale, is, the, questionnaire, of, cognitive, and, affective, empathy, qcae, first, published, in, 2011, the, empathic, experience, scale, is, a, 30, item, questionnaire, that, measures, empathy, from, a, phenomenological, perspective, on, intersubjectivity, which, provides, a, common, basis, for, the, perceptual, experience, vicarious, experience, dimension, and, a, basic, cognitive, awareness, intuitive, understanding, dimension, of, others, emotional, states, it, is, difficult, to, make, comparisons, over, time, using, such, questionnaires, because, of, how, language, changes, for, example, one, study, used, a, single, questionnaire, to, measure, 13, 737, college, students, between, 1979, and, 2009, and, found, that, empathy, scores, fell, substantially, over, that, time, a, critic, noted, these, results, could, be, because, the, wording, of, the, questionnaire, had, become, anachronistically, quaint, it, used, idioms, no, longer, in, common, use, like, tender, feelings, ill, at, ease, quite, touched, or, go, to, pieces, that, today, s, students, might, not, identify, with, by, the, age, of, two, children, normally, begin, to, exhibit, fundamental, behaviors, of, empathy, by, having, an, emotional, response, that, corresponds, with, another, person, s, emotional, state, even, earlier, at, one, year, of, age, infants, have, some, rudiments, of, empathy, they, understand, that, as, with, their, own, actions, other, people, s, actions, have, goals, toddlers, sometimes, comfort, others, or, show, concern, for, them, during, their, second, year, they, play, games, of, falsehood, or, pretend, in, an, effort, to, fool, others, such, actions, require, that, the, child, knows, what, others, believe, in, order, that, the, child, can, manipulate, those, beliefs, according, to, researchers, at, the, university, of, chicago, who, used, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, children, between, the, ages, of, seven, and, twelve, when, seeing, others, being, injured, experience, brain, activity, similar, that, which, would, occur, if, the, child, themself, had, been, injured, their, findings, are, consistent, with, previous, fmri, studies, of, pain, empathy, with, adults, and, previous, findings, that, vicarious, experiencing, particularly, of, others, distress, is, hardwired, and, present, early, in, life, the, research, found, additional, areas, of, the, brain, associated, with, social, and, moral, cognition, were, activated, when, young, people, saw, another, person, intentionally, hurt, by, somebody, including, regions, involved, in, moral, reasoning, although, children, are, capable, of, showing, some, signs, of, empathy, including, attempting, to, comfort, a, crying, baby, from, as, early, as, 18, months, to, two, years, most, do, not, demonstrate, a, full, theory, of, mind, until, around, the, age, of, four, theory, of, mind, involves, the, ability, to, understand, that, other, people, may, have, beliefs, that, are, different, from, one, s, own, and, is, thought, to, involve, the, cognitive, component, of, empathy, children, usually, can, pass, false, belief, tasks, a, test, for, a, theory, of, mind, around, the, age, of, four, it, is, theorised, that, people, with, autism, find, using, a, theory, of, mind, to, be, very, difficult, but, there, is, quite, a, bit, of, controversy, on, this, subject, e, g, the, sally, anne, test, empathic, maturity, is, a, cognitive, structural, theory, developed, at, the, yale, university, school, of, nursing, it, addresses, how, adults, conceive, or, understand, the, personhood, of, patients, the, theory, first, applied, to, nurses, and, since, applied, to, other, professions, postulates, three, levels, of, cognitive, structures, the, third, and, highest, level, is, a, meta, ethical, theory, of, the, moral, structure, of, care, adults, who, operate, with, level, iii, understanding, synthesize, systems, of, justice, and, care, based, ethics, the, empathic, concern, scale, assesses, other, oriented, feelings, of, sympathy, and, concern, and, the, personal, distress, scale, measures, self, oriented, feelings, of, personal, anxiety, and, unease, researchers, have, used, behavioral, and, neuroimaging, data, to, analyze, extraversion, and, agreeableness, both, are, associated, with, empathic, accuracy, and, increased, brain, activity, in, two, brain, regions, that, are, important, for, empathic, processing, medial, prefrontal, cortex, and, temporoparietal, junction, on, average, females, score, higher, than, males, on, measures, of, empathy, such, as, the, empathy, quotient, eq, while, males, tend, to, score, higher, on, the, systemizing, quotient, sq, both, males, and, females, with, autistic, spectrum, disorders, usually, score, lower, on, the, eq, and, higher, on, sq, see, below, for, more, detail, on, autism, and, empathy, other, studies, show, no, significant, sex, differences, and, instead, suggest, that, gender, differences, are, the, result, of, motivational, differences, such, as, upholding, stereotypes, gender, stereotypes, about, men, and, women, can, affect, how, they, express, emotions, the, sex, difference, is, small, to, moderate, somewhat, inconsistent, and, is, often, influenced, by, the, person, s, motivations, or, social, environment, bosson, et, al, say, physiological, measures, of, emotion, and, studies, that, track, people, in, their, daily, lives, find, no, consistent, sex, differences, in, the, experience, of, emotion, which, suggests, that, women, may, amplify, certain, emotional, expressions, or, men, may, suppress, them, however, a, 2014, review, from, neuroscience, biobehavioral, reviews, reported, that, there, is, evidence, that, sex, differences, in, empathy, have, phylogenetic, and, ontogenetic, roots, in, biology, and, are, not, merely, cultural, byproducts, driven, by, socialization, the, review, found, sex, differences, in, empathy, from, birth, growing, larger, with, age, and, consistent, and, stable, across, lifespan, females, on, average, had, higher, empathy, than, males, while, children, with, higher, empathy, regardless, of, gender, continue, to, be, higher, in, empathy, throughout, development, analysis, of, brain, event, related, potentials, found, that, females, who, saw, human, suffering, tended, to, have, higher, erp, waveforms, than, males, an, investigation, of, n400, amplitudes, found, on, average, higher, n400, in, females, in, response, to, social, situations, which, positively, correlated, with, self, reported, empathy, structural, fmri, studies, also, found, females, to, have, larger, grey, matter, volumes, in, posterior, inferior, frontal, and, anterior, inferior, parietal, cortex, areas, which, are, correlated, with, mirror, neurons, in, fmri, literature, females, also, tended, to, have, a, stronger, link, between, emotional, and, cognitive, empathy, the, researchers, believe, that, the, stability, of, these, sex, differences, in, development, are, unlikely, to, be, explained, by, environmental, influences, but, rather, by, human, evolution, and, inheritance, throughout, prehistory, women, were, the, primary, nurturers, and, caretakers, of, children, so, this, might, have, led, to, an, evolved, neurological, adaptation, for, women, to, be, more, aware, and, responsive, to, non, verbal, expressions, according, to, the, primary, caretaker, hypothesis, prehistoric, men, did, not, have, such, selective, pressure, as, primary, caretakers, this, might, explain, modern, day, sex, differences, in, emotion, recognition, and, empathy, a, review, published, in, neuropsychologia, found, that, females, tended, to, be, better, at, recognizing, facial, affects, expression, processing, and, emotions, in, general, males, tended, to, be, better, at, recognizing, specific, behaviors, such, as, anger, aggression, and, threatening, cues, a, 2014, meta, analysis, in, cognition, and, emotion, found, a, small, female, advantage, in, non, verbal, emotional, recognition, some, research, theorizes, that, environmental, factors, such, as, parenting, style, and, relationships, affect, the, development, of, empathy, in, children, empathy, promotes, pro, social, relationships, and, helps, mediate, aggression, caroline, tisot, studied, how, environmental, factors, like, parenting, style, parent, empathy, and, prior, social, experiences, affect, the, development, of, empathy, in, young, children, the, children, studied, were, asked, to, complete, an, effective, empathy, measure, while, the, children, s, parents, completed, a, questionnaire, to, assess, parenting, style, and, the, balanced, emotional, empathy, scale, the, study, found, that, certain, parenting, practices, as, opposed, to, parenting, style, as, a, whole, contributed, to, the, development, of, empathy, in, children, these, practices, include, encouraging, the, child, to, imagine, the, perspectives, of, others, and, teaching, the, child, to, reflect, on, his, or, her, own, feelings, the, development, of, empathy, varied, based, on, the, gender, of, the, child, and, parent, paternal, warmth, was, significantly, positively, related, to, empathy, in, children, especially, boys, maternal, warmth, was, negatively, related, to, empathy, in, children, especially, girls, empathy, may, be, disrupted, due, to, brain, trauma, such, as, stroke, in, most, cases, empathy, is, impaired, if, a, lesion, or, stroke, occurs, on, the, right, side, of, the, brain, damage, to, the, frontal, lobe, which, is, primarily, responsible, for, emotional, regulation, can, profoundly, impact, a, person, s, capacity, to, experience, empathy, people, with, an, acquired, brain, injury, also, show, lower, levels, of, empathy, more, than, half, of, those, people, with, a, traumatic, brain, injury, self, report, a, deficit, in, their, empathic, capacity, there, is, some, evidence, that, empathy, is, a, skill, that, one, can, improve, in, with, training, in, fact, some, studies, have, reported, virtual, reality, technology, as, a, promising, instrument, to, facilitate, empathetic, behavior, in, end, users, studies, in, animal, behavior, and, neuroscience, indicate, that, empathy, is, not, restricted, to, humans, however, the, interpretation, of, such, research, depends, in, part, on, how, expansive, a, definition, of, empathy, researchers, adopt, empathy, like, behaviors, have, been, observed, in, primates, both, in, captivity, and, in, the, wild, and, in, particular, in, bonobos, perhaps, the, most, empathic, primate, one, study, demonstrated, prosocial, behavior, elicited, by, empathy, in, rodents, rodents, demonstrate, empathy, for, cagemates, but, not, strangers, in, pain, an, influential, study, on, the, evolution, of, empathy, by, stephanie, preston, and, frans, de, waal, discusses, a, neural, perception, action, mechanism, and, postulates, a, bottom, up, model, of, empathy, that, ties, together, all, levels, from, state, matching, to, perspective, taking, university, of, chicago, neurobiologist, jean, decety, agrees, that, empathy, is, not, exclusive, to, humans, but, that, empathy, has, deep, evolutionary, biochemical, and, neurological, underpinnings, and, that, even, the, most, advanced, forms, of, empathy, in, humans, are, built, on, more, basic, forms, and, remain, connected, to, core, mechanisms, associated, with, affective, communication, social, attachment, and, parental, care, neural, circuits, involved, in, empathy, and, caring, include, the, brainstem, the, amygdala, hypothalamus, basal, ganglia, insula, and, orbitofrontal, cortex, researchers, zanna, clay, and, frans, de, waal, studied, the, socio, emotional, development, of, the, bonobo, chimpanzee, they, focused, on, the, interplay, of, numerous, skills, such, as, empathy, related, responding, and, how, different, rearing, backgrounds, of, the, juvenile, bonobo, affected, their, response, to, stressful, events, events, related, to, themselves, e, g, loss, of, a, fight, as, well, as, stressful, events, of, others, they, found, that, bonobos, sought, out, body, contact, with, one, another, as, a, coping, mechanism, bonobos, sought, out, more, body, contact, after, watching, an, event, distress, other, bonobos, than, after, their, individually, experienced, stressful, event, mother, reared, bonobos, sought, out, more, physical, contact, than, orphaned, bonobos, after, a, stressful, event, happened, to, another, this, finding, shows, the, importance, of, mother, child, attachment, and, bonding, in, successful, socio, emotional, development, such, as, empathic, like, behaviors, de, waal, suggests, the, advantages, provided, to, mothers, who, understand, the, needs, of, their, children, are, the, reason, empathy, evolved, in, the, first, place, empathic, like, behavior, has, been, observed, in, chimpanzees, in, different, aspects, of, their, natural, behaviors, for, example, chimpanzees, spontaneously, contribute, comforting, behaviors, to, victims, of, aggressive, behavior, in, both, natural, and, unnatural, settings, a, behavior, recognized, as, consolation, researchers, led, by, teresa, romero, observed, these, empathic, and, sympathetic, like, behaviors, in, chimpanzees, in, two, separate, outdoor, housed, groups, acts, of, consolation, were, observed, in, both, groups, this, behavior, is, also, found, in, humans, particularly, in, human, infants, another, similarity, found, between, chimpanzees, and, humans, is, that, empathic, like, responding, was, disproportionately, provided, to, kin, although, comforting, towards, non, family, chimpanzees, was, also, observed, as, with, humans, chimpanzees, showed, the, majority, of, comfort, and, concern, to, close, loved, ones, another, similarity, between, chimpanzee, and, human, expression, of, empathy, is, that, females, provided, more, comfort, than, males, on, average, the, only, exception, to, this, discovery, was, that, high, ranking, males, showed, as, much, empathy, like, behavior, as, their, female, counterparts, this, is, believed, to, be, because, of, policing, like, behavior, and, the, authoritative, status, of, high, ranking, male, chimpanzees, canines, have, been, hypothesized, to, share, empathic, like, responding, towards, human, species, researchers, custance, and, mayer, put, individual, dogs, in, an, enclosure, with, their, owner, and, a, stranger, when, the, participants, were, talking, or, humming, the, dog, showed, no, behavioral, changes, however, when, the, participants, were, pretending, to, cry, the, dogs, oriented, their, behavior, toward, the, person, in, distress, whether, it, be, the, owner, or, stranger, the, dogs, approached, the, participants, when, crying, in, a, submissive, fashion, by, sniffing, licking, and, nuzzling, the, distressed, person, the, dogs, did, not, approach, the, participants, in, the, usual, form, of, excitement, tail, wagging, or, panting, since, the, dogs, did, not, direct, their, empathic, like, responses, only, towards, their, owner, it, is, hypothesized, that, dogs, generally, seek, out, humans, showing, distressing, body, behavior, although, this, could, suggest, that, dogs, have, the, cognitive, capacity, for, empathy, it, could, also, mean, that, domesticated, dogs, have, learned, to, comfort, distressed, humans, through, generations, of, being, rewarded, for, that, specific, behavior, when, witnessing, chicks, in, distress, domesticated, hens, gallus, gallus, domesticus, show, emotional, and, physiological, responding, researchers, found, that, in, conditions, where, the, chick, was, susceptible, to, danger, the, mother, hen, s, heart, rate, increased, it, sounded, vocal, alarms, it, decreased, its, personal, preening, and, its, body, temperature, increased, this, responding, happened, whether, or, not, the, chick, felt, as, if, it, were, in, danger, mother, hens, experienced, stress, induced, hyperthermia, only, when, the, chick, s, behavior, correlated, with, the, perceived, threat, animal, maternal, behavior, may, be, perceived, as, empathy, however, it, could, be, guided, by, the, evolutionary, principles, of, survival, and, not, emotionality, humans, can, empathize, with, other, species, one, study, of, a, sample, of, organisms, showed, that, the, strength, of, human, empathic, perceptions, and, compassionate, reactions, toward, an, organism, is, negatively, correlated, with, how, long, ago, our, species, had, a, common, ancestor, in, other, words, the, more, phylogenetically, close, a, species, is, to, us, the, more, likely, we, are, to, feel, empathy, and, compassion, towards, it, measures, of, empathy, show, evidence, of, being, genetically, influenced, for, example, carriers, of, the, deletion, variant, of, adra2b, show, more, activation, of, the, amygdala, when, viewing, emotionally, arousing, images, the, gene, 5, httlpr, seems, to, influence, sensitivity, to, negative, emotional, information, and, is, also, attenuated, by, the, deletion, variant, of, adra2b, carriers, of, the, double, g, variant, of, the, oxtr, gene, have, better, social, skills, and, higher, self, esteem, a, gene, located, near, lrrn1, on, chromosome, 3, influences, the, human, ability, to, read, understand, and, respond, to, emotions, in, others, contemporary, neuroscience, offers, insights, into, the, neural, basis, of, the, mind, s, ability, to, understand, and, process, emotion, studies, of, mirror, neurons, attempt, to, measure, the, neural, basis, for, human, mind, reading, and, emotion, sharing, abilities, and, thereby, to, explain, the, basis, of, the, empathy, reaction, people, who, score, high, on, empathy, tests, have, especially, busy, mirror, neuron, systems, empathy, is, a, spontaneous, sharing, of, affect, provoked, by, witnessing, and, sympathizing, with, another, s, emotional, state, the, empathic, person, mirrors, or, mimics, the, emotional, response, they, would, expect, to, feel, if, they, were, in, the, other, person, s, place, unlike, personal, distress, empathy, is, not, characterized, by, aversion, to, another, s, emotional, response, this, distinction, is, vital, because, empathy, is, associated, with, the, moral, emotion, sympathy, or, empathic, concern, and, consequently, also, prosocial, or, altruistic, action, a, person, empathizes, by, feeling, what, they, believe, to, be, the, emotions, of, another, which, makes, empathy, both, affective, and, cognitive, for, social, beings, negotiating, interpersonal, decisions, is, as, important, to, survival, as, being, able, to, navigate, the, physical, landscape, meta, analysis, of, fmri, studies, of, empathy, confirms, that, different, brain, areas, are, activated, during, affective, perceptual, empathy, than, during, cognitive, evaluative, empathy, affective, empathy, is, correlated, with, increased, activity, in, the, insula, while, cognitive, empathy, is, correlated, with, activity, in, the, mid, cingulate, cortex, and, adjacent, dorsomedial, prefrontal, cortex, a, study, with, patients, who, experienced, different, types, of, brain, damage, confirmed, the, distinction, between, emotional, and, cognitive, empathy, specifically, the, inferior, frontal, gyrus, appears, to, be, responsible, for, emotional, empathy, and, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, gyrus, seems, to, mediate, cognitive, empathy, fmri, has, been, employed, to, investigate, the, functional, anatomy, of, empathy, observing, another, person, s, emotional, state, activates, parts, of, the, neuronal, network, that, are, involved, in, processing, that, same, state, in, oneself, whether, it, is, disgust, touch, or, pain, as, these, emotional, states, are, being, observed, the, brain, is, able, activate, a, network, of, the, brain, that, is, involved, in, empathy, there, are, two, separate, systems, of, the, brain, involved, with, the, feeling, of, empathy, a, cognitive, system, and, an, emotional, system, the, cognitive, system, helps, an, individual, understand, another, s, perspective, while, the, emotional, system, enables, our, ability, to, empathize, emotionally, the, neuronal, network, that, is, activated, controls, the, observers, response, to, these, emotional, states, thus, prompting, an, empathetic, response, the, study, of, the, neural, underpinnings, of, empathy, received, increased, interest, following, a, paper, published, by, s, d, preston, and, frans, de, waal, after, the, discovery, of, mirror, neurons, in, monkeys, that, fire, both, when, the, creature, watches, another, perform, an, action, and, when, they, themselves, perform, it, researchers, suggest, that, paying, attention, to, perceiving, another, individual, s, state, activates, neural, representations, and, that, this, activation, primes, or, generates, the, associated, autonomic, and, somatic, responses, perception, action, coupling, unless, inhibited, this, mechanism, resembles, the, common, coding, theory, between, perception, and, action, another, study, provides, evidence, of, separate, neural, pathways, activating, reciprocal, suppression, in, different, regions, of, the, brain, associated, with, the, performance, of, social, and, mechanical, tasks, these, findings, suggest, that, the, cognition, associated, with, reasoning, about, the, state, of, another, person, s, mind, and, causal, mechanical, properties, of, inanimate, objects, are, neurally, suppressed, from, occurring, at, the, same, time, mirroring, behavior, in, motor, neurons, during, empathy, may, help, duplicate, feelings, such, sympathetic, action, may, afford, access, to, sympathetic, feelings, and, perhaps, trigger, emotions, of, kindness, and, forgiveness, a, difference, in, distribution, between, affective, and, cognitive, empathy, has, been, observed, in, various, conditions, psychopathy, and, narcissism, are, associated, with, impairments, in, affective, but, not, cognitive, empathy, whereas, bipolar, disorder, is, associated, with, deficits, in, cognitive, but, not, affective, empathy, people, with, borderline, personality, disorder, bpd, may, suffer, from, impairments, in, cognitive, empathy, as, well, as, fluctuating, affective, empathy, although, this, topic, is, controversial, schizophrenia, too, is, associated, with, deficits, in, both, types, of, empathy, however, even, in, people, without, conditions, such, as, these, the, balance, between, affective, and, cognitive, empathy, varies, atypical, empathic, responses, are, associated, with, some, personality, disorders, such, as, psychopathy, borderline, narcissistic, and, schizoid, personality, disorders, conduct, disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, and, depersonalization, sex, offenders, who, had, been, raised, in, an, environment, where, they, were, shown, a, lack, of, empathy, and, had, endured, abuse, of, the, sort, they, later, committed, felt, less, affective, empathy, for, their, victims, the, subject, of, whether, autism, affects, empathy, is, a, controversial, and, complex, area, of, study, several, different, factors, are, proposed, to, be, at, play, such, as, mirror, neurons, alexithymia, and, more, the, double, empathy, problem, theory, proposes, that, prior, studies, on, autism, and, empathy, may, have, been, misinterpreted, and, that, autistic, people, show, the, same, levels, of, cognitive, empathy, towards, one, another, as, non, autistic, people, do, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, is, often, correlated, to, problems, with, empathy, and, social, communication, skills, however, like, asd, itself, these, issues, are, often, found, to, be, on, a, spectrum, the, suggestion, that, people, with, autism, are, likely, to, have, issues, with, personal, relationships, and, empathy, is, a, complex, issue, that, has, been, addressed, in, many, studies, various, research, has, been, exploring, these, concepts, for, more, than, twenty, years, certain, studies, like, this, one, from, 2004, found, connections, between, asd, and, empathy, issues, another, study, found, that, empathy, problems, may, be, associated, to, the, comorbidity, of, alexithymia, a, struggle, to, feel, emotions, and, asd, however, a, more, recent, study, from, 2022, found, that, there, were, in, fact, no, significant, differences, between, the, brain, sections, medial, prefrontal, cortex, and, amygdala, that, are, associated, with, empathy, another, study, 2023, focusing, on, asd, and, empathy, with, regards, to, mirror, neurons, also, reflected, on, the, theory, that, mirror, neurons, may, be, dysfunctional, in, asd, however, as, the, researchers, state, this, connection, is, not, clear, and, although, mirror, neurons, are, correlated, to, asd, there, is, no, proven, causational, relationship, between, dysfunctional, mirror, neurons, and, asd, the, study, from, 2023, might, be, considered, contradictory, to, an, earlier, 2006, study, on, mirror, neurons, that, found, that, high, functioning, autistic, children, showed, reduced, mirror, neuron, activity, in, the, brain, s, inferior, frontal, gyrus, while, imitating, and, observing, emotional, expressions, in, other, children, who, were, considered, neurotypical, the, correlation, between, asd, and, empathy, is, a, focus, for, researchers, and, many, relevant, articles, can, be, found, in, the, journal, of, autism, and, developmental, disorders, psychopathy, is, a, personality, construct, partly, characterized, by, antisocial, and, aggressive, behaviors, as, well, as, emotional, and, interpersonal, deficits, including, shallow, emotions, and, a, lack, of, remorse, and, empathy, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, and, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, list, antisocial, personality, disorder, aspd, and, dissocial, personality, disorder, stating, that, these, have, been, referred, to, as, or, include, what, is, referred, to, as, psychopathy, psychopathy, is, associated, with, atypical, responses, to, distress, cues, e, g, facial, and, vocal, expressions, of, fear, and, sadness, including, decreased, activation, of, the, fusiform, and, extrastriate, cortical, regions, which, may, partly, account, for, impaired, recognition, of, and, reduced, autonomic, responsiveness, to, expressions, of, fear, and, impairments, of, empathy, studies, on, children, with, psychopathic, tendencies, have, also, shown, such, associations, the, underlying, biological, surfaces, for, processing, expressions, of, happiness, are, functionally, intact, in, psychopaths, although, less, responsive, than, in, those, of, controls, the, neuroimaging, literature, is, unclear, as, to, whether, deficits, are, specific, to, particular, emotions, such, as, fear, some, fmri, studies, report, that, emotion, perception, deficits, in, psychopathy, are, pervasive, across, emotions, positives, and, negatives, one, study, on, psychopaths, found, that, under, certain, circumstances, they, could, willfully, empathize, with, others, and, that, their, empathic, reaction, initiated, the, same, way, it, does, for, controls, psychopathic, criminals, were, brain, scanned, while, watching, videos, of, a, person, harming, another, individual, the, psychopaths, empathic, reaction, initiated, the, same, way, it, did, for, controls, when, they, were, instructed, to, empathize, with, the, harmed, individual, and, the, area, of, the, brain, relating, to, pain, was, activated, when, the, psychopaths, were, asked, to, imagine, how, the, harmed, individual, felt, the, research, suggests, psychopaths, can, switch, empathy, on, at, will, which, would, enable, them, to, be, both, callous, and, charming, the, team, who, conducted, the, study, say, they, do, not, know, how, to, transform, this, willful, empathy, into, the, spontaneous, empathy, most, people, have, though, they, propose, it, might, be, possible, to, rehabilitate, psychopaths, by, helping, them, to, activate, their, empathy, switch, others, suggested, that, it, remains, unclear, whether, psychopaths, experience, of, empathy, was, the, same, as, that, of, controls, and, also, questioned, the, possibility, of, devising, therapeutic, interventions, that, would, make, the, empathic, reactions, more, automatic, one, problem, with, the, theory, that, the, ability, to, turn, empathy, on, and, off, constitutes, psychopathy, is, that, such, a, theory, would, classify, socially, sanctioned, violence, and, punishment, as, psychopathy, as, these, entail, suspending, empathy, towards, certain, individuals, and, or, groups, the, attempt, to, get, around, this, by, standardizing, tests, of, psychopathy, for, cultures, with, different, norms, of, punishment, is, criticized, in, this, context, for, being, based, on, the, assumption, that, people, can, be, classified, in, discrete, cultures, while, cultural, influences, are, in, reality, mixed, and, every, person, encounters, a, mosaic, of, influences, psychopathy, may, be, an, artefact, of, psychiatry, s, standardization, along, imaginary, sharp, lines, between, cultures, as, opposed, to, an, actual, difference, in, the, brain, work, conducted, by, professor, jean, decety, with, large, samples, of, incarcerated, psychopaths, offers, additional, insights, in, one, study, psychopaths, were, scanned, while, viewing, video, clips, depicting, people, being, intentionally, hurt, they, were, also, tested, on, their, responses, to, seeing, short, videos, of, facial, expressions, of, pain, the, participants, in, the, high, psychopathy, group, exhibited, significantly, less, activation, in, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, amygdala, and, periaqueductal, gray, parts, of, the, brain, but, more, activity, in, the, striatum, and, the, insula, when, compared, to, control, participants, in, a, second, study, individuals, with, psychopathy, exhibited, a, strong, response, in, pain, affective, brain, regions, when, taking, an, imagine, self, perspective, but, failed, to, recruit, the, neural, circuits, that, were, activated, in, controls, during, an, imagine, other, perspective, in, particular, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, and, amygdala, which, may, contribute, to, their, lack, of, empathic, concern, researchers, have, investigated, whether, people, who, have, high, levels, of, psychopathy, have, sufficient, levels, of, cognitive, empathy, but, lack, the, ability, to, use, affective, empathy, people, who, score, highly, on, psychopathy, measures, are, less, likely, to, exhibit, affective, empathy, there, was, a, strong, negative, correlation, showing, that, psychopathy, and, lack, of, affective, empathy, correspond, strongly, the, danva, 2, found, those, who, scored, highly, on, the, psychopathy, scale, do, not, lack, in, recognising, emotion, in, facial, expressions, therefore, such, individuals, do, not, lack, in, perspective, talking, ability, but, do, lack, in, compassion, regarding, the, experiences, of, others, neuroscientist, antonio, r, damasio, and, his, colleagues, showed, that, subjects, with, damage, to, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, lack, the, ability, to, empathically, feel, their, way, to, moral, answers, and, that, when, confronted, with, moral, dilemmas, these, brain, damaged, patients, coldly, came, up, with, end, justifies, the, means, answers, leading, damasio, to, conclude, that, the, point, was, not, that, they, reached, immoral, conclusions, but, that, when, they, were, confronted, by, a, difficult, issue, in, this, case, as, whether, to, shoot, down, a, passenger, plane, hijacked, by, terrorists, before, it, hits, a, major, city, these, patients, appear, to, reach, decisions, without, the, anguish, that, afflicts, those, with, normally, functioning, brains, according, to, adrian, raine, a, clinical, neuroscientist, also, at, the, university, of, southern, california, one, of, this, study, s, implications, is, that, society, may, have, to, rethink, how, it, judges, immoral, people, psychopaths, often, feel, no, empathy, or, remorse, without, that, awareness, people, relying, exclusively, on, reasoning, seem, to, find, it, harder, to, sort, their, way, through, moral, thickets, does, that, mean, they, should, be, held, to, different, standards, of, accountability, despite, studies, suggesting, psychopaths, have, deficits, in, emotion, perception, and, imagining, others, in, pain, professor, simon, baron, cohen, claims, psychopathy, is, associated, with, intact, cognitive, empathy, which, would, imply, an, intact, ability, to, read, and, respond, to, behaviors, social, cues, and, what, others, are, feeling, psychopathy, is, however, associated, with, impairment, in, the, other, major, component, of, empathy, affective, emotional, empathy, which, includes, the, ability, to, feel, the, suffering, and, emotions, of, others, emotional, contagion, and, those, with, the, condition, are, therefore, not, distressed, by, the, suffering, of, their, victims, such, a, dissociation, of, affective, and, cognitive, empathy, has, been, demonstrated, for,

people, with, borderline, personality, disorder, react, while, individuals, with, borderline, personality, disorder, may, show, their, emotions, excessively, their, ability, to, feel, empathy, is, a, topic, of, much, dispute, with, contradictory, findings, some, studies, assert, impairments, in, cognitive, empathy, in, bpd, patients, yet, no, affective, empathy, impairments, while, other, studies, have, found, impairments, in, both, affective, and, cognitive, empathy, fluctuating, empathy, fluctuating, between, normal, range, of, empathy, reduced, sense, of, empathy, and, a, lack, of, empathy,

conducted, by, jean, decety, and, colleagues, at, the, university, of, chicago, demonstrated, that, subjects, with, aggressive, conduct, disorder, demonstrate, atypical, empathic, responses, when, viewing, others, in, pain, subjects, with, conduct, disorder, were, at, least, as, responsive, as, controls, to, the, pain, of, others, but, unlike, controls, subjects, with, conduct, disorder, showed, strong, and, specific, activation, of, the, amygdala, and, ventral, striatum, areas, that, enable, a, general, arousing, effect, of, reward, yet, impaired, activation, of, the, neural,

gradually, develops, throughout, life, and, which, improves, the, more, contact, we, have, with, the, person, with, whom, one, empathizes, empathizers, report, finding, it, easier, to, take, the,

people, empathize, with, another, they, may, oversimplify, that, other, person, in, order, to, make, them, more, legible, it, may, improve, empathic, accuracy, for, the, empathizer, to, explicitly, ask, the, person, empathized, with, for, confirmation, of, the, empathic, hypothesis, however, people, may, be, reluctant, to, abandon, their, empathic, hypotheses, even, when, they, are, explicitly, denied, because, we, oversimplify, people, in, order, to, make, them, legible, enough, to, empathize, with, we, can, come, to, misapprehend, how, cohesive, other, people, are, we, may, come, to, think, of, ourselves, as, lacking, a, strong, integral, self, in, comparison, fritz, breithaupt, calls, this, the, empathic, endowment, effect, because, the, empathic, person, must, temporarily, dampen, their, own, sense, of, self, in, order, to, empathize, with, the, other, and, because, the, other, seems, to, have, a, magnified, and, extra, cohesive, sense, of, self, the, empathic, person, may, suffer, from, this, and, may, project, onto, others, the, self, that, they, are, lacking, and, envy, that, which, they, must, give, up, in, order, to, be, able, to, feel, empathy, a, strong, self, some, research, suggests, that, people, are, more, able, and, willing, to, empathize, with, those, most, similar, to, themselves, in, particular, empathy, increases, with, similarities, in, culture, and, living, conditions, empathy, is, more, likely, to, occur, between, individuals, whose, interaction, is, more, frequent, 62, a, measure, of, how, well, a, person, can, infer, the, specific, content, of, another, person, s, thoughts, and, feelings, was, developed, by, william, ickes, in, one, experiment, researchers, gave, two, groups, of, men, wristbands, according, to, which, football, team, they, supported, each, participant, received, a, mild, electric, shock, then, watched, another, go, through, the, same, pain, when, the, wristbands, matched, both, brains, flared, with, pain, and, empathic, pain, if, they, supported, opposing, teams, the, observer, was, found, to, have, little, empathy, psychologist, paul, bloom, author, of, against, empathy, points, out, that, empathic, bias, can, result, in, tribalism, and, violent, responses, in, the, name, of, helping, people, of, the, same, tribe, or, social, group, for, example, when, empathic, bias, is, exploited, by, demagogues, he, proposes, rational, compassion, as, an, alternative, one, example, is, using, effective, altruism, to, decide, on, charitable, donations, rationally, rather, than, by, relying, on, emotional, responses, to, images, in, the, media, higher, empathy, tends, to, reduce, the, accuracy, of, deception, detection, and, emotion, recognition, training, does, not, improve, deception, detection, empathy, can, also, be, exploited, by, sympathetic, beggars, bloom, points, to, the, example, of, street, children, in, india, who, can, get, many, donations, because, they, are, adorable, but, this, results, in, their, enslavement, by, organized, crime, bloom, says, that, though, someone, might, feel, better, about, themselves, and, find, more, meaning, in, life, than, they, give, to, the, person, in, front, of, them, in, some, cases, they, would, do, less, harm, and, in, many, cases, do, more, good, in, the, world, by, giving, to, an, effective, charity, through, an, impersonal, website, bloom, believes, improper, use, of, empathy, and, social, intelligence, can, lead, to, shortsighted, actions, and, parochialism, bloom, points, out, that, parents, who, have, too, much, short, term, empathy, might, create, long, term, problems, for, their, children, by, neglecting, discipline, helicopter, parenting, or, deciding, not, to, get, their, children, vaccinated, because, of, the, short, term, discomfort, people, experiencing, too, much, empathy, after, a, disaster, may, continue, to, send, donations, like, canned, goods, or, used, clothing, even, after, being, asked, to, stop, or, to, send, cash, instead, and, this, can, make, the, situation, worse, by, creating, the, need, to, dispose, of, useless, donations, and, taking, resources, away, from, helpful, activities, bloom, also, finds, empathy, can, encourage, unethical, behavior, when, it, causes, people, to, care, more, about, attractive, people, than, ugly, people, or, people, of, one, s, own, race, vs, people, of, a, different, race, the, attractiveness, bias, can, also, affect, wildlife, conservation, efforts, increasing, the, amount, of, money, devoted, and, laws, passed, to, protect, cute, and, photogenic, animals, while, taking, attention, away, from, species, that, are, more, ecologically, important, people, tend, to, empathize, less, when, they, have, more, social, or, political, power, for, example, people, from, lower, class, backgrounds, exhibit, better, empathic, accuracy, than, those, from, upper, class, backgrounds, in, a, variety, of, priming, experiments, people, who, were, asked, to, recall, a, situation, in, which, they, had, power, over, someone, else, then, demonstrated, reduced, ability, to, mirror, others, to, comprehend, their, viewpoints, or, to, learn, from, their, perspectives, bloom, says, that, although, psychopaths, have, low, empathy, the, correlation, between, low, empathy, and, violent, behavior, as, documented, in, scientific, studies, is, zero, other, measures, are, much, more, predictive, of, violent, behavior, such, as, lack, of, self, control, excessive, empathy, can, lead, to, empathic, distress, fatigue, especially, if, it, is, associated, with, pathological, altruism, the, medical, risks, are, fatigue, occupational, burnout, guilt, shame, anxiety, and, depression, tania, singer, says, that, health, care, workers, and, caregivers, must, be, objective, regarding, the, emotions, of, others, they, should, not, over, invest, their, own, emotions, in, the, other, at, the, risk, of, draining, away, their, own, resourcefulness, paul, bloom, points, out, that, high, empathy, nurses, tend, to, spend, less, time, with, their, patients, to, avoid, feeling, negative, emotions, associated, with, witnessing, suffering, despite, empathy, being, often, portrayed, as, a, positive, attribute, whether, or, not, the, people, who, express, empathy, are, viewed, favorably, depends, on, who, they, show, empathy, for, such, is, the, case, in, which, a, third, party, observes, a, subject, showing, empathy, for, someone, of, questionable, character, or, generally, viewed, as, unethical, that, third, party, might, not, like, or, respect, the, subject, for, it, this, is, called, empathy, backfire, investigators, into, the, social, response, to, natural, disasters, researched, the, characteristics, associated, with, individuals, who, help, victims, researchers, found, that, cognitive, empathy, rather, than, emotional, empathy, predicted, helping, behavior, towards, victims, taking, on, the, perspectives, of, others, cognitive, empathy, may, allow, these, helpers, to, better, empathize, with, victims, without, as, much, discomfort, whereas, sharing, the, emotions, of, the, victims, emotional, empathy, can, cause, emotional, distress, helplessness, and, victim, blaming, and, may, lead, to, avoidance, rather, than, helping, individuals, who, expressed, concern, for, the, vulnerable, i, e, affective, empathy, were, more, willing, to, accept, the, covid, 19, pandemic, lockdown, measures, that, create, distress, people, who, understand, how, empathic, feelings, evoke, altruistic, motivation, may, adopt, strategies, for, suppressing, or, avoiding, such, feelings, such, numbing, or, loss, of, the, capacity, to, feel, empathy, for, clients, is, a, possible, factor, in, the, experience, of, burnout, among, case, workers, in, helping, professions, people, can, better, cognitively, control, their, actions, the, more, they, understand, how, altruistic, behavior, emerges, whether, it, is, from, minimizing, sadness, or, the, arousal, of, mirror, neurons, empathy, induced, altruism, may, not, always, produce, pro, social, effects, for, example, it, could, lead, one, to, exert, oneself, on, behalf, of, those, for, whom, empathy, is, felt, at, the, expense, of, other, potential, pro, social, goals, thus, inducing, a, type, of, bias, researchers, suggest, that, individuals, are, willing, to, act, against, the, greater, collective, good, or, to, violate, their, own, moral, principles, of, fairness, and, justice, if, doing, so, will, benefit, a, person, for, whom, empathy, is, felt, empathy, based, socialization, differs, from, inhibition, of, egoistic, impulses, through, shaping, modeling, and, internalized, guilt, therapeutic, programs, to, foster, altruistic, impulses, by, encouraging, perspective, taking, and, empathic, feelings, might, enable, individuals, to, develop, more, satisfactory, interpersonal, relations, especially, in, the, long, term, empathy, induced, altruism, can, improve, attitudes, toward, stigmatized, groups, racial, attitudes, and, actions, toward, people, with, aids, the, homeless, and, convicts, such, resulting, altruism, also, increases, cooperation, in, competitive, situations, empathy, is, good, at, prompting, prosocial, behaviors, that, are, informal, unplanned, and, directed, at, someone, who, is, immediately, present, but, is, not, as, good, at, prompting, more, abstractly, considered, long, term, prosocial, behavior, empathy, can, not, only, be, a, precursor, to, one, s, own, helpful, acts, but, can, also, be, a, way, of, inviting, help, from, others, if, you, mimic, the, posture, facial, expressions, and, vocal, style, of, someone, you, are, with, you, can, thereby, encourage, them, to, help, you, and, to, form, a, favorable, opinion, of, you, empathic, anger, is, an, emotion, a, form, of, empathic, distress, empathic, anger, is, felt, in, a, situation, where, someone, else, is, being, hurt, by, another, person, or, thing, empathic, anger, affects, desires, to, help, and, to, punish, two, sub, categories, of, empathic, anger, are, state, empathic, anger, current, empathic, anger, and, trait, empathic, anger, tendency, or, predisposition, to, experience, empathic, anger, the, higher, a, person, s, perspective, taking, ability, the, less, angry, they, are, in, response, to, a, provocation, empathic, concern, does, not, however, significantly, predict, anger, response, and, higher, personal, distress, is, associated, with, increased, anger, empathic, distress, is, feeling, the, perceived, pain, of, another, person, this, feeling, can, be, transformed, into, empathic, anger, feelings, of, injustice, or, guilt, these, emotions, can, be, perceived, as, pro, social, however, views, differ, as, to, whether, they, serve, as, motives, for, moral, behavior, stoic, philosophers, believed, that, to, condition, your, emotional, disposition, on, the, emotions, or, fortunes, of, someone, else, is, foolish, cicero, said, that, someone, who, feels, distress, at, another, s, misfortune, is, committing, as, much, of, an, error, as, an, envious, person, who, feels, distress, at, another, s, good, fortune, in, the, 2007, book, the, ethics, of, care, and, empathy, philosopher, michael, slote, introduces, a, theory, of, care, based, ethics, that, is, grounded, in, empathy, he, claims, that, moral, motivation, does, and, should, stem, from, a, basis, of, empathic, response, and, that, our, natural, reaction, to, situations, of, moral, significance, are, explained, by, empathy, he, explains, that, the, limits, and, obligations, of, empathy, and, in, turn, morality, are, natural, these, natural, obligations, include, a, greater, empathic, and, moral, obligation, to, family, and, friends, and, to, those, close, to, us, in, time, and, space, our, moral, obligation, to, such, people, seems, naturally, stronger, to, us, than, that, to, strangers, at, a, distance, slote, explains, that, this, is, due, to, the, natural, process, of, empathy, he, asserts, that, actions, are, wrong, if, and, only, if, they, reflect, or, exhibit, a, deficiency, of, fully, developed, empathic, concern, for, others, on, the, part, of, the, agent, in, phenomenology, empathy, describes, the, experience, of, something, from, the, other, s, viewpoint, without, confusion, between, self, and, other, this, is, based, on, the, concept, of, agency, in, the, most, basic, sense, phenomenology, is, the, experience, of, the, other, s, body, as, my, body, over, there, in, most, other, respects, however, it, is, an, experience, viewed, through, the, person, s, own, eyes, in, experiencing, empathy, what, is, experienced, is, not, my, experience, even, though, i, experience, it, empathy, is, also, considered, to, be, the, condition, of, intersubjectivity, and, as, such, the, source, of, the, constitution, of, objectivity, some, postmodernist, historians, such, as, keith, jenkins, have, debated, whether, or, not, it, is, possible, to, empathize, with, people, from, the, past, jenkins, argues, that, empathy, only, enjoys, such, a, privileged, position, in, the, present, because, it, corresponds, harmoniously, with, the, dominant, liberal, discourse, of, modern, society, and, can, be, connected, to, john, stuart, mill, s, concept, of, reciprocal, freedom, jenkins, argues, the, past, is, a, foreign, country, and, as, we, do, not, have, access, to, the, epistemological, conditions, of, bygone, ages, we, are, unable, to, empathize, with, those, who, lived, then, heinz, kohut, introduced, the, principle, of, empathy, in, psychoanalysis, his, principle, applies, to, the, method, of, gathering, unconscious, material, because, empathy, seems, to, have, potential, to, improve, customer, relations, employee, morale, and, personnel, management, capability, it, has, been, studied, in, a, business, context, in, the, 2009, book, wired, to, care, strategy, consultant, dev, patnaik, argues, that, a, major, flaw, in, contemporary, business, practice, is, a, lack, of, empathy, inside, large, corporations, he, states, that, without, empathy, people, inside, companies, struggle, to, make, intuitive, decisions, and, often, get, fooled, into, believing, they, understand, their, business, if, they, have, quantitative, research, to, rely, upon, he, says, that, companies, can, create, a, sense, of, empathy, for, customers, pointing, to, nike, harley, davidson, and, ibm, as, examples, of, open, empathy, organizations, such, companies, he, claims, see, new, opportunities, more, quickly, than, competitors, adapt, to, change, more, easily, and, create, workplaces, that, offer, employees, a, greater, sense, of, mission, in, their, jobs, in, the, 2011, book, the, empathy, factor, organizational, consultant, marie, miyashiro, similarly, argues, for, bringing, empathy, to, the, workplace, and, suggests, nonviolent, communication, as, an, effective, mechanism, for, achieving, this, in, studies, by, the, management, research, group, empathy, was, found, to, be, the, strongest, predictor, of, ethical, leadership, behavior, out, of, 22, competencies, in, its, management, model, and, empathy, was, one, of, the, three, strongest, predictors, of, senior, executive, effectiveness, the, leadership, consulting, firm, development, dimensions, international, found, in, 2016, that, 20, of, u, s, employers, offered, empathy, training, to, managers, a, study, by, the, center, for, creative, leadership, found, empathy, to, be, positively, correlated, to, job, performance, among, employees, as, well, patricia, moore, pioneered, using, empathic, techniques, to, better, understand, customers, for, example, she, used, makeup, and, prosthetics, to, simulate, the, experience, of, elderly, people, and, used, the, insights, from, this, to, inspire, friendlier, products, for, that, customer, segment, design, engineers, at, ford, motor, company, wore, prosthetics, to, simulate, pregnancy, and, old, age, to, help, them, design, cars, that, would, work, better, for, such, customers, fidelity, investments, trains, its, telephone, customer, service, employees, in, a, virtual, reality, app, that, puts, them, in, a, dramatized, customer, s, home, so, they, can, experience, what, it, is, like, to, be, on, the, other, side, of, their, conversations, empathic, perspective, taking, plays, important, roles, in, sustaining, cooperation, in, human, societies, as, studied, by, evolutionary, game, theory, in, game, theoretical, models, indirect, reciprocity, refers, to, the, mechanism, of, cooperation, based, on, moral, reputations, that, are, assigned, to, individuals, based, on, their, perceived, adherence, a, set, of, moral, rules, called, social, norms, it, has, been, shown, that, if, reputations, are, relative, and, individuals, disagree, on, the, moral, standing, of, others, for, example, because, they, use, different, moral, evaluation, rules, or, make, errors, of, judgement, then, cooperation, will, not, be, sustained, however, when, individuals, have, the, capacity, for, empathic, perspective, taking, altruistic, behavior, can, once, again, evolve, moreover, evolutionary, models, also, revealed, that, empathic, perspective, taking, itself, can, evolve, promoting, prosocial, behavior, in, human, populations, another, growing, focus, of, investigation, is, how, empathy, manifests, in, education, between, teachers, and, learners, although, there, is, general, agreement, that, empathy, is, essential, in, educational, settings, research, found, that, it, is, difficult, to, develop, empathy, in, trainee, teachers, learning, by, teaching, is, one, method, used, to, teach, empathy, students, transmit, new, content, to, their, classmates, so, they, have, to, reflect, continuously, on, those, classmates, mental, processes, this, develops, the, students, feeling, for, group, reactions, and, networking, carl, r, rogers, pioneered, research, in, effective, psychotherapy, and, teaching, which, espoused, that, empathy, coupled, with, unconditional, positive, regard, or, caring, for, students, and, authenticity, or, congruence, were, the, most, important, traits, for, a, therapist, or, teacher, to, have, other, research, and, meta, analyses, corroborated, the, importance, of, these, person, centered, traits, within, medical, education, a, hidden, curriculum, appears, to, dampen, or, even, reduce, medical, student, empathy, according, to, one, theory, empathy, is, one, of, seven, components, involved, in, the, effectiveness, of, intercultural, communication, this, theory, also, states, that, empathy, is, learnable, however, research, also, shows, that, people, experience, more, difficulty, empathizing, with, others, who, are, different, from, them, in, characteristics, such, as, status, culture, religion, language, skin, colour, gender, and, age, to, build, intercultural, empathy, in, others, psychologists, employ, empathy, training, researchers, william, weeks, paul, pedersen, et, al, state, that, people, who, develop, intercultural, empathy, can, interpret, experiences, or, perspectives, from, more, than, one, worldview, intercultural, empathy, can, also, improve, self, awareness, and, critical, awareness, of, one, s, own, interaction, style, as, conditioned, by, one, s, cultural, views, and, promote, a, view, of, self, as, process, the, greatest, benefits, we, owe, to, the, artist, whether, painter, poet, or, novelist, is, the, extension, of, our, sympathies, appeals, founded, on, generalizations, and, statistics, require, a, sympathy, ready, made, a, moral, sentiment, already, in, activity, but, a, picture, of, human, life, such, as, a, great, artist, can, give, surprises, even, the, trivial, and, the, selfish, into, that, attention, to, what, is, apart, from, themselves, which, may, be, called, the, raw, material, of, moral, sentiment, art, is, the, nearest, thing, to, life, it, is, a, mode, of, amplifying, experience, and, extending, our, contact, with, our, fellow, men, beyond, the, bounds, of, our, personal, lot, lynn, hunt, argued, in, inventing, human, rights, a, history, that, the, concept, of, human, rights, developed, how, it, did, and, when, it, did, in, part, as, a, result, of, the, influence, of, mid, eighteenth, century, european, novelists, particularly, those, whose, use, of, the, epistolatory, novel, form, gave, readers, a, more, vivid, sense, that, they, were, gaining, access, to, the, candid, details, of, a, real, life, the, epistolatory, novel, did, not, just, reflect, important, cultural, and, social, changes, of, the, time, novel, reading, actually, helped, create, new, kinds, of, feelings, including, a, recognition, of, shared, psychological, experiences, and, these, feelings, then, translated, into, new, cultural, and, social, movements, including, human, rights, the, power, of, empathy, has, become, a, frequent, ability, in, fiction, specifically, in, that, of, superhero, media, empaths, have, the, ability, to, sense, feel, the, emotions, and, bodily, sensations, of, others, and, in, some, cases, influence, or, control, them, although, sometimes, a, specific, power, held, by, specific, characters, such, as, the, marvel, comics, character, empath, the, power, has, also, been, frequently, linked, to, that, of, telepathy, such, as, in, the, case, of, jean, grey, the, rebooted, television, series, charmed, portrays, the, character, maggie, vera, as, a, witch, with, the, power, of, empathy, her, powers, later, expand, to, allow, her, to, control, the, emotions, of, others, as, well, as, occasionally, concentrate, emotion, into, pure, energy, in, season, four, she, learns, to, replicate, people, s, powers, by, empathically, understanding, them, in, the, 2013, nbc, television, show, reinterpretation, of, hannibal, we, are, introduced, in, the, first, episode, to, will, graham, graham, is, unique, in, that, he, seems, to, have, exceptionally, high, levels, of, both, cognitive, and, emotional, empathy, combined, with, an, eidetic, memory, and, imagination, these, abilities, help, him, understand, the, motives, of, some, of, the, most, depraved, killers, hannibal, lecter, calls, his, ability, pure, empathy, graham, can, assume, the, viewpoint, of, virtually, anyone, he, meets, even, viewpoints, that, sicken, him, when, evaluating, a, crime, scene, he, uses, his, imagination, and, empathy, to, almost, become, the, killer, feeling, what, they, were, feeling, during, a, murder
