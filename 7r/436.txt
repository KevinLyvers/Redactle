sinhala, s, n, h, l, s, l, sin, h, l, sing, l, sinhala, si, hala, sometimes, called, sinhalese, s, n, h, l, i, z, s, l, i, z, sin, h, leez, sing, g, leez, is, an, indo, aryan, language, primarily, spoken, by, the, sinhalese, people, of, sri, lanka, who, make, up, the, largest, ethnic, group, on, the, island, numbering, about, 16, million, sinhala, is, also, spoken, as, the, first, language, by, other, ethnic, groups, in, sri, lanka, totalling, about, 2, million, speakers, as, of, 2001, it, is, written, using, the, sinhala, script, which, is, a, brahmic, script, closely, related, to, the, grantha, script, of, south, india, sinhala, is, one, of, the, official, and, national, languages, of, sri, lanka, alongside, tamil, along, with, pali, it, played, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, theravada, buddhist, literature, early, forms, of, the, sinhala, language, are, attested, as, early, as, the, 3rd, century, bce, the, language, of, these, inscriptions, still, retaining, long, vowels, and, aspirated, consonants, is, a, prakrit, similar, to, magadhi, a, regional, associate, of, the, middle, indian, prakrits, that, had, been, used, during, the, time, of, the, buddha, the, most, closely, related, languages, are, the, vedda, language, an, endangered, indigenous, creole, still, spoken, by, a, minority, of, sri, lankans, mixing, sinhala, with, an, isolate, of, unknown, origin, and, from, which, old, sinhala, borrowed, various, aspects, into, its, main, indo, aryan, substrate, and, the, maldivian, language, it, has, two, main, varieties, written, and, spoken, and, is, a, conspicuous, example, of, the, linguistic, phenomenon, known, as, diglossia, sinhala, si, hala, is, a, sanskrit, term, the, corresponding, middle, indo, aryan, e, u, word, is, s, hala, the, name, is, a, derivative, of, si, ha, the, sanskrit, word, for, lion, the, name, is, sometimes, glossed, as, abode, of, lions, and, attributed, to, a, supposed, former, abundance, of, lions, on, the, island, according, to, the, chronicle, mah, va, sa, written, in, pali, prince, vijaya, of, the, vanga, kingdom, and, his, entourage, merged, in, sri, lanka, with, later, settlers, from, the, pandya, kingdom, in, the, following, centuries, there, was, substantial, immigration, from, eastern, india, including, additional, migration, from, the, vanga, kingdom, bengal, as, well, as, kalinga, and, magadha, this, influx, led, to, an, admixture, of, features, of, eastern, prakrits, the, development, of, sinhala, is, divided, into, four, epochs, the, most, important, phonetic, developments, of, sinhala, include, according, to, wilhelm, geiger, an, example, of, a, possible, western, feature, in, sinhala, is, the, retention, of, initial, v, which, developed, into, b, in, the, eastern, languages, e, g, sanskrit, vi, ati, twenty, sinhala, visi, hindi, b, s, this, is, disputed, by, muhammad, shahidullah, who, says, that, sinhala, prakrit, branched, off, from, the, eastern, prakrits, prior, to, this, change, he, cites, the, edicts, of, ashoka, no, copy, of, which, shows, this, sound, change, an, example, of, an, eastern, feature, is, the, ending, e, for, masculine, nominative, singular, instead, of, western, o, in, sinhalese, prakrit, there, are, several, cases, of, vocabulary, doublets, one, example, being, the, words, m, ss, fly, and, m, kk, flea, which, both, correspond, to, sanskrit, mak, ik, but, stem, from, two, regionally, different, prakrit, words, macchi, western, prakrits, and, makkhik, as, in, eastern, prakrits, like, pali, in, 1815, the, island, of, ceylon, came, under, british, rule, during, the, career, of, christopher, reynolds, as, a, sinhalese, lecturer, at, the, school, of, african, and, oriental, studies, university, of, london, he, extensively, researched, the, sinhalese, language, and, its, pre, 1815, literature, the, sri, lankan, government, awarded, him, the, sri, lanka, ranjana, medal, for, his, work, he, wrote, the, 377, page, an, anthology, of, sinhalese, literature, up, to, 1815, selected, by, the, unesco, national, commission, of, ceylon, according, to, wilhelm, geiger, sinhala, has, features, that, set, it, apart, from, other, indo, aryan, languages, some, of, the, differences, can, be, explained, by, the, substrate, influence, of, the, parent, stock, of, the, vedda, language, sinhala, has, many, words, that, are, only, found, in, sinhala, or, shared, between, sinhala, and, vedda, and, not, etymologically, derivable, from, middle, or, old, indo, aryan, possible, examples, include, kola, for, leaf, in, sinhala, and, vedda, although, others, suggest, a, dravidian, origin, for, this, word, dola, for, pig, in, vedda, and, offering, in, sinhala, other, common, words, are, rera, for, wild, duck, and, gala, for, stones, in, toponyms, used, throughout, the, island, although, others, have, also, suggested, a, dravidian, origin, there, are, also, high, frequency, words, denoting, body, parts, in, sinhala, such, as, olluva, for, head, kakula, for, leg, bella, for, neck, and, kalava, for, thighs, that, are, derived, from, pre, sinhalese, languages, of, sri, lanka, the, oldest, sinhala, grammar, sidatsan, garav, written, in, the, 13th, century, ce, recognised, a, category, of, words, that, exclusively, belonged, to, early, sinhala, the, grammar, lists, naram, ba, to, see, and, ko, om, ba, fort, or, harbour, as, belonging, to, an, indigenous, source, ko, om, ba, is, the, source, of, the, name, of, the, commercial, capital, colombo, the, consistent, left, branching, syntax, and, the, loss, of, aspirated, stops, in, sinhala, is, attributed, to, a, probable, south, dravidian, substratum, effect, this, has, been, explained, by, a, period, of, prior, bilingualism, the, earliest, type, of, contact, in, sri, lanka, not, considering, the, aboriginal, vedda, languages, was, that, which, occurred, between, south, dravidian, and, sinhala, it, seems, plausible, to, assume, prolonged, contact, between, these, two, populations, as, well, as, a, high, degree, of, bilingualism, this, explains, why, sinhala, looks, deeply, south, dravidian, for, an, indo, aryan, language, there, is, corroboration, in, genetic, findings, in, addition, to, many, tamil, loanwords, several, phonetic, and, grammatical, features, also, present, in, neighbouring, dravidian, languages, set, modern, spoken, sinhala, apart, from, its, northern, indo, aryan, relatives, these, features, are, evidence, of, close, interactions, with, dravidian, speakers, some, of, the, features, that, may, be, traced, to, dravidian, influence, are, ka, it, a, ut, new, kiyal, having, said, mama, i, dannav, know, ka, a, ut, kiyal, mama, dannav, it, new, having, said, i, know, i, know, that, it, is, new, ka, it, a, ut, new, da, q, kiyal, having, said, mama, i, dann, know, emp, n, h, not, ka, a, ut, da, kiyal, mama, dann, n, h, it, new, q, having, said, i, know, emp, not, i, do, not, know, whether, it, is, new, as, a, result, of, centuries, of, colonial, rule, interaction, settlement, intermarriage, and, assimilation, modern, sinhala, contains, many, portuguese, dutch, and, english, loanwords, macanese, patois, or, macau, creole, known, as, patu, to, its, speakers, is, a, creole, language, derived, mainly, from, malay, sinhala, cantonese, and, portuguese, which, was, originally, spoken, by, the, macanese, people, of, the, portuguese, colony, of, macau, it, is, now, spoken, by, a, few, families, in, macau, and, in, the, macanese, diaspora, the, language, developed, first, mainly, among, the, descendants, of, portuguese, settlers, who, often, married, women, from, malacca, and, sri, lanka, rather, than, from, neighbouring, china, so, the, language, had, strong, malay, and, sinhala, influence, from, the, beginning, the, sinhala, language, has, different, types, of, variations, which, are, commonly, identified, as, dialects, and, accents, among, those, variations, regional, variations, are, prominent, some, of, the, well, known, regional, variations, of, sinhala, language, are, people, from, uva, province, also, have, a, unique, linguistic, variation, in, relation, to, the, pronunciation, of, words, in, general, sinhala, singular, words, are, pluralized, by, adding, suffixes, like, o, hu, wal, or, waru, but, when, it, comes, to, monaragala, the, situation, is, somewhat, different, as, when, nouns, are, pluralized, a, nasal, sound, is, added, k, ntaw, woman, kant, w, women, k, ntaw, kant, w, woman, women, lindha, well, lindha, n, lindh, an, wells, lindha, lindha, n, lindh, an, well, wells, pot, book, pot, books, pot, pot, book, books, oya, stream, oya, n, oy, an, streams, oya, oya, n, oy, an, stream, streams, lindh, well, lindh, wal, wal, wells, lindh, lindh, wal, wal, well, wells, the, kamath, language, an, indigenous, language, of, paddy, culture, used, by, the, southerners, is, somewhat, different, from, the, kamath, language, used, in, other, parts, uva, kandy, of, sri, lanka, as, it, is, marked, with, a, systematic, variation, boya, at, the, end, of, the, majority, of, nouns, as, the, examples, below, show, here, the, particular, word, boya, means, a, little, in, the, southern, region, and, at, the, end, of, most, of, nouns, boya, is, added, regularly, this, particular, word, boya, is, added, to, most, words, by, the, southern, villages, as, a, token, of, respect, towards, the, things, those, things, can, be, crops, tools, etc, they, are, referring, to, elder, brother, are, you, coming, to, sow, tomorrow, ayye, heta, wapuranda, enawada, kegalle, ayye, heta, wapuranna, enawai, galle, also, kandy, people, add, a, ta, sound, at, the, end, of, verbs, while, the, kegalle, people, add, a, da, sound, but, galle, people, s, regional, variation, is, not, visible, in, relation, to, this, particular, verb, wapuranawa, to, sow, yet, their, unique, regional, variation, is, visible, in, relation, to, the, second, verb, which, is, enawai, coming, as, they, add, ai, at, the, end, of, most, verbs, even, though, the, kandy, kegalle, and, galle, people, pronounce, words, with, slight, differences, the, sinhalese, can, understand, the, majority, of, the, sentences, in, sinhala, there, is, distinctive, diglossia, where, the, literary, language, and, the, spoken, language, differ, from, each, other, in, significant, ways, while, the, lexicon, can, vary, continuously, between, formal, and, informal, contexts, there, is, a, sharp, contrast, between, two, distinct, systems, for, syntax, and, morphology, the, literary, language, is, used, in, writing, for, all, forms, of, prose, poetry, and, for, official, documents, but, also, orally, for, tv, and, radio, news, broadcasts, the, spoken, language, is, used, in, everyday, life, and, spans, informal, and, formal, contexts, religious, sermons, university, lectures, political, speeches, and, personal, letters, occupy, an, intermediate, space, where, features, from, both, spoken, and, literary, sinhala, are, used, together, and, choices, about, which, to, include, give, different, impressions, of, the, text, a, number, of, syntactic, and, morphological, differences, exist, between, the, two, varieties, the, most, apparent, difference, is, the, absence, of, subject, verb, agreement, in, spoken, sinhala, agreement, is, the, hallmark, of, literary, sinhala, and, is, the, sole, characteristic, used, in, determining, whether, a, given, example, of, sinhala, is, in, the, spoken, or, literary, variety, other, distinctions, include, the, sinhala, script, sinhala, hodiya, is, based, on, the, ancient, brahmi, script, and, is, thus, a, brahmic, script, along, with, most, indian, scripts, and, many, southeast, asian, scripts, the, sinhala, script, is, closely, related, to, grantha, script, and, khmer, script, but, it, has, also, taken, some, elements, from, the, related, kadamba, script, the, writing, system, for, sinhala, is, an, abugida, where, the, consonants, are, written, with, letters, while, the, vowels, are, indicated, with, diacritics, pilla, on, those, consonants, unlike, alphabets, like, english, where, both, consonants, and, vowels, are, full, letters, or, abjads, like, urdu, where, vowels, need, not, be, written, at, all, also, when, a, diacritic, is, not, used, an, inherent, vowel, either, a, or, is, understood, depending, on, the, position, of, the, consonant, within, the, word, for, example, the, letter, k, on, its, own, indicates, ka, realized, as, ka, in, stressed, syllables, and, k, in, unstressed, syllables, the, other, monophthong, vowels, are, written, ka, k, and, k, after, the, consonant, ki, and, ki, above, the, consonant, ku, and, ku, below, the, consonant, ke, and, ke, before, the, consonant, and, lastly, ko, and, ko, surrounding, the, consonant, for, simple, k, without, a, following, vowel, a, vowel, cancelling, diacritic, called, hal, kiri, m, hal, kirima, is, used, creating, k, there, are, also, a, few, diacritics, for, consonants, such, as, r, in, special, circumstances, although, the, tendency, now, is, to, spell, words, with, the, full, letter, r, with, a, hal, kirima, on, whichever, consonant, has, no, vowel, following, it, one, word, that, is, still, spelt, with, an, r, diacritic, is, as, in, ri, lank, wa, the, r, diacritic, is, the, curved, line, under, the, first, letter, a, second, diacritic, representing, the, vowel, sound, i, completes, the, word, several, of, these, diacritics, occur, in, two, or, more, forms, and, the, form, used, depends, on, the, shape, of, the, consonant, letter, vowels, also, have, independent, letters, but, these, are, only, used, at, the, beginning, of, words, where, there, is, no, preceding, consonant, to, add, a, diacritic, to, the, complete, script, consists, of, about, 60, letters, 18, for, vowels, and, 42, for, consonants, however, only, 57, 16, vowels, and, 41, consonants, are, required, for, writing, colloquial, spoken, sinhala, uddha, sinhala, the, rest, indicate, sounds, that, have, been, merged, in, the, course, of, linguistic, change, such, as, the, aspirates, and, are, restricted, to, sanskrit, and, pali, loan, words, one, letter, representing, the, sound, d, a, is, attested, in, the, script, although, only, a, few, words, using, this, letter, are, known, the, sinhala, script, is, written, from, left, to, right, and, is, mainly, used, for, sinhala, it, is, also, used, for, the, liturgical, languages, pali, and, sanskrit, which, are, important, in, buddhism, and, academic, works, the, alphabetic, sequence, is, similar, to, those, of, other, brahmic, scripts, sinhala, has, a, smaller, consonant, inventory, than, most, indo, aryan, languages, but, simultaneously, has, a, larger, vowel, inventory, than, most, as, an, insular, indo, aryan, language, it, and, dhivehi, have, features, divergent, from, rest, of, the, indo, aryan, languages, sinhala, s, nasal, consonants, are, unusual, among, indo, aryan, languages, for, lacking, the, retroflex, nasal, while, retaining, nasals, in, the, other, four, positions, sinhala, and, dhivehi, are, together, unique, for, having, prenasalised, consonants, which, are, not, found, in, any, other, indo, aryan, language, sinhala, has, so, called, prenasalised, consonants, or, half, nasal, consonants, a, short, homorganic, nasal, occurs, before, a, voiced, stop, it, is, both, shorter, than, a, nasal, alone, and, shorter, than, a, sequence, of, nasal, plus, stop, the, nasal, is, syllabified, with, the, onset, of, the, following, syllable, which, means, that, the, moraic, weight, of, the, preceding, syllable, is, left, unchanged, for, example, tam, ba, copper, contrasts, with, tamba, boil, all, consonants, other, than, the, prenasalised, consonants, h, and, can, be, geminated, occur, as, double, consonants, but, only, between, vowels, in, contexts, that, otherwise, trigger, gemination, prenasalised, consonants, become, the, corresponding, nasal, voiced, consonant, sequence, e, g, d, is, replaced, with, nd, is, found, in, learned, borrowings, from, sanskrit, including, in, the, honorific, r, found, in, phrases, including, the, country, s, name, sri, lanka, ri, la, ka, f, is, restricted, to, loans, typically, for, english, they, are, commonly, sometimes, replaced, by, p, and, s, respectively, some, speakers, use, as, in, english, and, some, use, due, to, its, similarity, to, the, native, p, sinhala, has, seven, vowel, qualities, with, a, phonemic, vowel, length, distinction, between, long, and, short, for, all, qualities, giving, a, total, inventory, of, 14, vowels, the, long, vowel, is, not, present, in, native, sinhala, words, but, instead, is, found, in, certain, english, loanwords, like, in, non, rhotic, dialects, of, english, this, long, vowel, can, be, represented, by, the, short, vowel, followed, by, an, r, as, in, shirt, a, and, have, a, largely, complementary, distribution, found, primarily, in, stressed, and, unstressed, syllables, respectively, however, there, are, certain, contrasting, pairs, between, the, two, phonemes, particularly, between, homographs, kar, shoulder, and, k, r, to, do, in, writing, a, and, are, both, spelt, without, a, vowel, sign, attached, to, the, consonant, letter, so, the, patterns, of, stress, in, the, language, must, be, used, to, determine, the, correct, pronunciation, stress, is, largely, predictable, and, only, contrastive, between, words, in, relatively, few, cases, so, this, does, not, present, a, problem, for, determining, the, pronunciation, of, a, given, word, most, sinhala, syllables, are, of, the, form, cv, the, first, syllable, of, each, word, is, stressed, with, the, exception, of, the, verb, k, r, n, wa, to, do, and, all, of, its, inflected, forms, where, the, first, syllable, is, unstressed, syllables, using, long, vowels, are, always, stressed, the, remainder, of, the, syllables, are, unstressed, if, they, use, a, short, vowel, unless, they, are, immediately, followed, by, one, of, a, ccv, syllable, final, j, i, final, wu, or, a, final, consonant, without, a, following, vowel, the, sound, ha, is, always, stressed, in, nouns, adjectives, and, adverbs, and, so, is, not, pronounced, h, except, in, the, word, hat, lih, forty, where, the, initial, ha, is, stressed, and, the, final, h, is, unstressed, nasalisation, of, vowels, is, common, in, certain, environments, particularly, before, a, prenasalised, consonant, nasalised, and, exist, as, marginal, phonemes, only, present, in, certain, interjections, native, sinhalese, words, are, limited, in, syllable, structure, to, c, v, c, v, and, cv, c, where, v, is, a, short, vowel, v, is, a, long, vowel, and, c, is, a, consonant, exceptions, exist, for, the, marginal, segment, cc, prenasalised, plosives, are, restricted, to, occurring, intervocalically, and, cannot, end, a, syllable, much, more, complicated, consonant, clusters, are, allowed, in, loan, words, particularly, from, sanskrit, and, english, an, example, being, pra, naya, question, words, cannot, end, in, nasals, other, than, because, of, historical, loss, of, the, fricative, h, in, the, suffix, hu, u, at, the, end, of, a, word, behaves, as, its, own, syllable, the, main, features, marked, on, sinhala, nouns, are, case, number, definiteness, and, animacy, sinhala, distinguishes, several, cases, the, five, primary, cases, are, the, nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, and, ablative, some, scholars, also, suggest, that, it, has, a, locative, and, instrumental, case, however, for, inanimate, nouns, the, locative, and, genitive, and, instrumental, and, ablative, are, identical, in, addition, for, animate, nouns, these, cases, formed, by, placing, ati, with, the, hand, and, la, g, near, directly, after, the, nominative, the, brackets, with, most, of, the, vowel, length, symbols, indicate, the, optional, shortening, of, long, vowels, in, certain, unstressed, syllables, forming, plurals, in, sinhala, is, unpredictable, in, sinhala, animate, nouns, the, plural, is, marked, with, o, a, long, consonant, plus, u, or, with, la, most, inanimates, mark, the, plural, through, disfixation, loanwords, from, english, mark, the, singular, with, ek, and, do, not, mark, the, plural, this, can, be, interpreted, as, a, singulative, number, on, the, left, hand, side, of, the, table, plurals, are, longer, than, singulars, on, the, right, hand, side, it, is, the, other, way, round, with, the, exception, of, pa, r, street, lexemes, are, mostly, in, the, classes, on, the, left, hand, side, while, lexemes, are, most, often, in, the, classes, on, the, right, hand, the, indefinite, article, is, ek, for, animates, and, ak, for, inanimates, the, indefinite, article, exists, only, in, the, singular, where, its, absence, marks, definiteness, in, the, plural, in, definiteness, does, not, receive, special, marking, sinhala, distinguishes, three, conjugation, classes, spoken, sinhala, does, not, mark, person, number, or, gender, on, the, verb, literary, sinhala, does, in, other, words, there, is, no, subject, verb, agreement, mal, flowers, hat, r, four, mal, hat, r, flowers, four, the, four, flowers, it, can, be, argued, that, the, numeral, is, the, head, in, this, construction, and, the, flowers, the, modifier, so, that, a, more, literal, english, rendering, would, be, a, floral, foursome, pot, book, ja, under, pot, ja, book, under, under, the, book, mam, i, po, sat, rich, mam, po, sat, i, rich, i, am, rich, pot, books, li, n, writing, minisa, man, pot, li, n, minisa, books, writing, man, the, man, who, writes, books, there, is, a, four, way, deictic, system, which, is, rare, there, are, four, demonstrative, stems, see, demonstrative, pronouns, sinhalese, has, an, all, purpose, odd, suffix, thuma, which, when, suffixed, to, a, pronoun, creates, a, formal, and, respectful, tone, in, reference, to, a, person, this, is, usually, used, in, referring, to, politicians, nobles, and, priests, e, g, oba, thuma, you, vocative, when, addressing, a, minister, high, ranking, official, or, generally, showing, respect, in, public, etc, janadhipathi, thuma, janadhipathi, thuma, the, president, third, person, sinhala, is, a, pro, drop, language, arguments, of, a, sentence, can, be, omitted, when, they, can, be, inferred, from, context, this, is, true, for, subject, as, in, italian, for, instance, but, also, objects, and, other, parts, of, the, sentence, can, be, dropped, in, sinhala, if, they, can, be, inferred, in, that, sense, sinhala, can, be, called, a, super, pro, drop, language, like, japanese, ko, ed, where, ie, went, ko, ed, ie, where, went, can, mean, where, did, i, you, he, she, we, go, in, informal, contexts, sinhala, slang, may, be, integrated, into, the, vocabulary, used
