hypnosis, is, a, human, condition, involving, focused, attention, the, selective, attention, selective, inattention, hypothesis, sasi, reduced, peripheral, awareness, and, an, enhanced, capacity, to, respond, to, suggestion, there, are, competing, theories, explaining, hypnosis, and, related, phenomena, altered, state, theories, see, hypnosis, as, an, altered, state, of, mind, or, trance, marked, by, a, level, of, awareness, different, from, the, ordinary, state, of, consciousness, in, contrast, non, state, theories, see, hypnosis, as, variously, a, type, of, placebo, effect, a, redefinition, of, an, interaction, with, a, therapist, or, a, form, of, imaginative, role, enactment, during, hypnosis, a, person, is, said, to, have, heightened, focus, and, concentration, and, an, increased, response, to, suggestions, hypnosis, usually, begins, with, a, hypnotic, induction, involving, a, series, of, preliminary, instructions, and, suggestions, the, use, of, hypnosis, for, therapeutic, purposes, is, referred, to, as, hypnotherapy, while, its, use, as, a, form, of, entertainment, for, an, audience, is, known, as, stage, hypnosis, a, form, of, mentalism, hypnosis, based, therapies, for, the, management, of, irritable, bowel, syndrome, and, menopause, are, supported, by, evidence, use, of, hypnosis, for, treatment, of, other, problems, has, produced, mixed, results, such, as, with, smoking, cessation, the, use, of, hypnosis, as, a, form, of, therapy, to, retrieve, and, integrate, early, trauma, is, controversial, within, the, scientific, mainstream, research, indicates, that, hypnotising, an, individual, may, aid, the, formation, of, false, memories, and, that, hypnosis, does, not, help, people, recall, events, more, accurately, medical, hypnosis, is, often, considered, pseudoscience, or, quackery, the, words, hypnosis, and, hypnotism, both, derive, from, the, term, neuro, hypnotism, nervous, sleep, all, of, which, were, coined, by, tienne, f, lix, d, henin, de, cuvillers, in, the, 1820s, the, term, hypnosis, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, hypnos, sleep, and, the, suffix, osis, or, from, hypno, put, to, sleep, stem, of, aorist, hypn, s, and, the, suffix, is, these, words, were, popularised, in, english, by, the, scottish, surgeon, james, braid, to, whom, they, are, sometimes, wrongly, attributed, around, 1841, braid, based, his, practice, on, that, developed, by, franz, mesmer, and, his, followers, which, was, called, mesmerism, or, animal, magnetism, but, differed, in, his, theory, as, to, how, the, procedure, worked, people, have, been, entering, into, hypnotic, type, trances, for, thousands, of, years, in, many, cultures, and, religions, it, was, regarded, as, a, form, of, meditation, the, earliest, record, of, a, description, of, a, hypnotic, state, can, be, found, in, the, writings, of, avicenna, a, persian, physician, who, wrote, about, trance, in, 1027, modern, day, hypnosis, started, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, was, made, popular, by, franz, mesmer, a, german, physician, who, became, known, as, the, father, of, modern, hypnotism, hypnosis, was, known, at, the, time, as, mesmerism, being, named, after, mesmer, mesmer, held, the, opinion, that, hypnosis, was, a, sort, of, mystical, force, that, flows, from, the, hypnotist, to, the, person, being, hypnotised, but, his, theory, was, dismissed, by, critics, who, asserted, that, there, is, no, magical, element, to, hypnotism, abb, faria, a, luso, goan, catholic, monk, was, one, of, the, pioneers, of, the, scientific, study, of, hypnotism, following, on, from, the, work, of, franz, mesmer, unlike, mesmer, who, claimed, that, hypnosis, was, mediated, by, animal, magnetism, faria, believed, that, it, worked, purely, by, the, power, of, suggestion, before, long, hypnotism, started, finding, its, way, into, the, world, of, modern, medicine, the, use, of, hypnotism, in, the, medical, field, was, made, popular, by, surgeons, and, physicians, like, elliotson, and, james, esdaile, and, researchers, like, james, braid, who, helped, to, reveal, the, biological, and, physical, benefits, of, hypnotism, according, to, his, writings, braid, began, to, hear, reports, concerning, various, oriental, meditative, practices, soon, after, the, release, of, his, first, publication, on, hypnotism, neurypnology, 1843, he, first, discussed, some, of, these, oriental, practices, in, a, series, of, articles, entitled, magic, mesmerism, hypnotism, etc, historically, physiologically, considered, he, drew, analogies, between, his, own, practice, of, hypnotism, and, various, forms, of, hindu, yoga, meditation, and, other, ancient, spiritual, practices, especially, those, involving, voluntary, burial, and, apparent, human, hibernation, braid, s, interest, in, these, practices, stems, from, his, studies, of, the, dabist, n, i, maz, hib, the, school, of, religions, an, ancient, persian, text, describing, a, wide, variety, of, oriental, religious, rituals, beliefs, and, practices, last, may, a, gentleman, residing, in, edinburgh, personally, unknown, to, me, who, had, long, resided, in, india, favored, me, with, a, letter, expressing, his, approbation, of, the, views, which, i, had, published, on, the, nature, and, causes, of, hypnotic, and, mesmeric, phenomena, in, corroboration, of, my, views, he, referred, to, what, he, had, previously, witnessed, in, oriental, regions, and, recommended, me, to, look, into, the, dabistan, a, book, lately, published, for, additional, proof, to, the, same, effect, on, much, recommendation, i, immediately, sent, for, a, copy, of, the, dabistan, in, which, i, found, many, statements, corroborative, of, the, fact, that, the, eastern, saints, are, all, self, hypnotisers, adopting, means, essentially, the, same, as, those, which, i, had, recommended, for, similar, purposes, although, he, rejected, the, transcendental, metaphysical, interpretation, given, to, these, phenomena, outright, braid, accepted, that, these, accounts, of, oriental, practices, supported, his, view, that, the, effects, of, hypnotism, could, be, produced, in, solitude, without, the, presence, of, any, other, person, as, he, had, already, proved, to, his, own, satisfaction, with, the, experiments, he, had, conducted, in, november, 1841, and, he, saw, correlations, between, many, of, the, metaphysical, oriental, practices, and, his, own, rational, neuro, hypnotism, and, totally, rejected, all, of, the, fluid, theories, and, magnetic, practices, of, the, mesmerists, as, he, later, wrote, in, as, much, as, patients, can, throw, themselves, into, the, nervous, sleep, and, manifest, all, the, usual, phenomena, of, mesmerism, through, their, own, unaided, efforts, as, i, have, so, repeatedly, proved, by, causing, them, to, maintain, a, steady, fixed, gaze, at, any, point, concentrating, their, whole, mental, energies, on, the, idea, of, the, object, looked, at, or, that, the, same, may, arise, by, the, patient, looking, at, the, point, of, his, own, finger, or, as, the, magi, of, persia, and, yogi, of, india, have, practised, for, the, last, 2, 400, years, for, religious, purposes, throwing, themselves, into, their, ecstatic, trances, by, each, maintaining, a, steady, fixed, gaze, at, the, tip, of, his, own, nose, it, is, obvious, that, there, is, no, need, for, an, exoteric, influence, to, produce, the, phenomena, of, mesmerism, the, great, object, in, all, these, processes, is, to, induce, a, habit, of, abstraction, or, concentration, of, attention, in, which, the, subject, is, entirely, absorbed, with, one, idea, or, train, of, ideas, whilst, he, is, unconscious, of, or, indifferently, conscious, to, every, other, object, purpose, or, action, avicenna, 980, 1037, a, persian, physician, documented, the, characteristics, of, the, trance, hypnotic, trance, state, in, 1027, at, that, time, hypnosis, as, a, medical, treatment, was, seldom, used, the, german, doctor, franz, mesmer, reintroduced, it, in, the, 18th, century, franz, mesmer, 1734, 1815, believed, that, there, is, a, magnetic, force, or, fluid, called, animal, magnetism, within, the, universe, that, influences, the, health, of, the, human, body, he, experimented, with, magnets, to, affect, this, field, in, order, to, produce, healing, by, around, 1774, he, had, concluded, that, the, same, effect, could, be, created, by, passing, the, hands, in, front, of, the, subject, s, body, later, referred, to, as, making, mesmeric, passes, in, 1784, at, the, request, of, king, louis, xvi, two, royal, commissions, on, animal, magnetism, were, specifically, charged, with, separately, investigating, the, claims, made, by, one, charles, d, eslon, 1750, 1786, a, disaffected, student, of, mesmer, for, the, existence, of, a, substantial, rather, than, metaphorical, as, mesmer, supposed, animal, magnetism, le, magn, tisme, animal, and, of, a, similarly, physical, magnetic, fluid, le, fluide, magn, tique, among, the, investigators, were, the, scientist, antoine, lavoisier, an, expert, in, electricity, and, terrestrial, magnetism, benjamin, franklin, and, an, expert, in, pain, control, joseph, ignace, guillotin, the, commissioners, investigated, the, practices, of, d, eslon, and, although, they, accepted, without, question, that, mesmer, s, cures, were, indeed, cures, they, did, not, investigate, whether, or, not, mesmer, was, the, agent, of, those, cures, significantly, in, their, investigations, of, d, eslon, s, procedures, they, conducted, an, expansive, series, of, randomized, controlled, trials, the, experimental, protocols, of, which, were, designed, by, lavoisier, including, the, application, of, both, sham, and, genuine, procedures, and, significantly, the, first, use, of, blindfolding, of, both, the, investigators, and, their, subjects, from, their, investigations, both, commissions, concluded, that, there, was, no, evidence, of, any, kind, to, support, d, eslon, s, claim, for, the, substantial, physical, existence, of, either, his, supposed, animal, magnetism, or, his, supposed, magnetic, fluid, and, in, the, process, they, determined, that, all, of, the, effects, they, had, observed, could, be, directly, attributed, to, a, physiological, rather, than, metaphysical, agency, namely, that, all, of, the, experimentally, observed, phenomena, could, be, directly, attributed, to, contact, imagination, and, or, imitation, eventually, mesmer, left, paris, and, went, back, to, vienna, to, practise, mesmerism, following, the, french, committee, s, findings, dugald, stewart, an, influential, academic, philosopher, of, the, scottish, school, of, common, sense, encouraged, physicians, in, his, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, the, human, mind, 1818, to, salvage, elements, of, mesmerism, by, replacing, the, supernatural, theory, of, animal, magnetism, with, a, new, interpretation, based, upon, common, sense, laws, of, physiology, and, psychology, braid, quotes, the, following, passage, from, stewart, it, appears, to, me, that, the, general, conclusions, established, by, mesmer, s, practice, with, respect, to, the, physical, effects, of, the, principle, of, imagination, more, particularly, in, cases, where, they, co, operated, together, are, incomparably, more, curious, than, if, he, had, actually, demonstrated, the, existence, of, his, boasted, science, nor, can, i, see, any, good, reason, why, a, physician, who, admits, the, efficacy, of, the, moral, agents, employed, by, mesmer, should, in, the, exercise, of, his, profession, scruple, to, copy, whatever, processes, are, necessary, for, subjecting, them, to, his, command, any, more, than, that, he, should, hesitate, about, employing, a, new, physical, agent, such, as, electricity, or, galvanism, in, braid, s, day, the, scottish, school, of, common, sense, provided, the, dominant, theories, of, academic, psychology, and, braid, refers, to, other, philosophers, within, this, tradition, throughout, his, writings, braid, therefore, revised, the, theory, and, practice, of, mesmerism, and, developed, his, own, method, of, hypnotism, as, a, more, rational, and, common, sense, alternative, it, may, here, be, requisite, for, me, to, explain, that, by, the, term, hypnotism, or, nervous, sleep, which, frequently, occurs, in, the, following, pages, i, mean, a, peculiar, condition, of, the, nervous, system, into, which, it, may, be, thrown, by, artificial, contrivance, and, which, differs, in, several, respects, from, common, sleep, or, the, waking, condition, i, do, not, allege, that, this, condition, is, induced, through, the, transmission, of, a, magnetic, or, occult, influence, from, my, body, into, that, of, my, patients, nor, do, i, profess, by, my, processes, to, produce, the, higher, phenomena, of, the, mesmerists, my, pretensions, are, of, a, much, more, humble, character, and, are, all, consistent, with, generally, admitted, principles, in, physiological, and, psychological, science, hypnotism, might, therefore, not, inaptly, be, designated, rational, mesmerism, in, contra, distinction, to, the, transcendental, mesmerism, of, the, mesmerists, despite, briefly, toying, with, the, name, rational, mesmerism, in, contra, distinction, to, the, entirely, different, transcendental, mesmerism, of, the, mesmerists, and, eventually, deciding, that, psycho, physiology, was, a, far, more, appropriate, and, far, more, usefully, descriptive, name, than, hypnotism, braid, ultimately, chose, to, emphasise, the, unique, aspects, of, his, approach, firmly, based, upon, the, dominant, idea, theories, of, his, edinburgh, university, teacher, the, philosopher, thomas, brown, m, d, carrying, out, informal, experiments, throughout, his, career, in, order, to, refute, theories, and, practices, that, invoked, supposed, supernatural, forces, that, demonstrated, the, role, of, ordinary, physiological, and, psychological, processes, such, as, suggestion, and, focused, attention, in, producing, the, observed, effects, braid, worked, very, closely, with, his, friend, and, ally, the, eminent, physiologist, professor, william, benjamin, carpenter, an, early, neuro, psychologist, who, introduced, the, ideo, motor, reflex, theory, of, suggestion, carpenter, had, observed, instances, of, expectation, and, imagination, apparently, influencing, involuntary, muscle, movement, a, classic, example, of, the, ideo, motor, principle, in, action, is, the, so, called, chevreul, pendulum, named, after, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, chevreul, claimed, that, divinatory, pendulae, were, made, to, swing, by, unconscious, muscle, movements, brought, about, by, focused, concentration, alone, braid, soon, assimilated, carpenter, s, observations, into, his, own, theory, realising, that, the, effect, of, focusing, attention, was, to, enhance, the, ideo, motor, reflex, response, braid, extended, carpenter, s, theory, to, encompass, the, influence, of, the, mind, upon, the, body, more, generally, beyond, the, muscular, system, and, therefore, referred, to, the, ideo, dynamic, response, and, coined, the, term, psycho, physiology, to, refer, to, the, study, of, general, mind, body, interaction, in, his, later, works, braid, reserved, the, term, hypnotism, for, cases, in, which, subjects, entered, a, state, of, amnesia, resembling, sleep, for, other, cases, he, spoke, of, a, mono, ideodynamic, principle, to, emphasise, that, the, eye, fixation, induction, technique, worked, by, narrowing, the, subject, s, attention, to, a, single, idea, or, train, of, thought, monoideism, which, amplified, the, effect, of, the, consequent, dominant, idea, upon, the, subject, s, body, by, means, of, the, ideo, dynamic, principle, for, several, decades, braid, s, work, became, more, influential, abroad, than, in, his, own, country, except, for, a, handful, of, followers, most, notably, dr, john, milne, bramwell, the, eminent, neurologist, dr, george, miller, beard, took, braid, s, theories, to, america, meanwhile, his, works, were, translated, into, german, by, william, thierry, preyer, professor, of, physiology, at, jena, university, the, psychiatrist, albert, moll, subsequently, continued, german, research, publishing, hypnotism, in, 1889, france, became, the, focal, point, for, the, study, of, braid, s, ideas, after, the, eminent, neurologist, dr, tienne, eug, ne, azam, translated, braid, s, last, manuscript, on, hypnotism, 1860, into, french, and, presented, braid, s, research, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, at, the, request, of, azam, paul, broca, and, others, the, french, academy, of, science, which, had, investigated, mesmerism, in, 1784, examined, braid, s, writings, shortly, after, his, death, azam, s, enthusiasm, for, hypnotism, influenced, ambroise, auguste, li, beault, a, country, doctor, hippolyte, bernheim, discovered, li, beault, s, enormously, popular, group, hypnotherapy, clinic, and, subsequently, became, an, influential, hypnotist, the, study, of, hypnotism, subsequently, revolved, around, the, fierce, debate, between, bernheim, and, jean, martin, charcot, the, two, most, influential, figures, in, late, 19th, century, hypnotism, charcot, operated, a, clinic, at, the, piti, salp, tri, re, hospital, thus, known, as, the, paris, school, or, the, salp, tri, re, school, while, bernheim, had, a, clinic, in, nancy, known, as, the, nancy, school, charcot, who, was, influenced, more, by, the, mesmerists, argued, that, hypnotism, was, an, abnormal, state, of, nervous, functioning, found, only, in, certain, hysterical, women, he, claimed, that, it, manifested, in, a, series, of, physical, reactions, that, could, be, divided, into, distinct, stages, bernheim, argued, that, anyone, could, be, hypnotised, that, it, was, an, extension, of, normal, psychological, functioning, and, that, its, effects, were, due, to, suggestion, after, decades, of, debate, bernheim, s, view, dominated, charcot, s, theory, is, now, just, a, historical, curiosity, pierre, janet, 1859, 1947, reported, studies, on, a, hypnotic, subject, in, 1882, charcot, subsequently, appointed, him, director, of, the, psychological, laboratory, at, the, salp, tri, re, in, 1889, after, janet, had, completed, his, phd, which, dealt, with, psychological, automatism, in, 1898, janet, was, appointed, psychology, lecturer, at, the, sorbonne, and, in, 1902, he, became, chair, of, experimental, and, comparative, psychology, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, janet, reconciled, elements, of, his, views, with, those, of, bernheim, and, his, followers, developing, his, own, sophisticated, hypnotic, psychotherapy, based, upon, the, concept, of, psychological, dissociation, which, at, the, turn, of, the, century, rivalled, freud, s, attempt, to, provide, a, more, comprehensive, theory, of, psychotherapy, sigmund, freud, 1856, 1939, the, founder, of, psychoanalysis, studied, hypnotism, at, the, paris, school, and, briefly, visited, the, nancy, school, at, first, freud, was, an, enthusiastic, proponent, of, hypnotherapy, he, initially, hypnotised, patients, and, pressed, on, their, foreheads, to, help, them, concentrate, while, attempting, to, recover, supposedly, repressed, memories, and, he, soon, began, to, emphasise, hypnotic, regression, and, ab, reaction, catharsis, as, therapeutic, methods, he, wrote, a, favorable, encyclopedia, article, on, hypnotism, translated, one, of, bernheim, s, works, into, german, and, published, an, influential, series, of, case, studies, with, his, colleague, joseph, breuer, entitled, studies, on, hysteria, 1895, this, became, the, founding, text, of, the, subsequent, tradition, known, as, hypno, analysis, or, regression, hypnotherapy, however, freud, gradually, abandoned, hypnotism, in, favour, of, psychoanalysis, emphasising, free, association, and, interpretation, of, the, unconscious, struggling, with, the, great, expense, of, time, that, psychoanalysis, required, freud, later, suggested, that, it, might, be, combined, with, hypnotic, suggestion, to, hasten, the, outcome, of, treatment, but, that, this, would, probably, weaken, the, outcome, it, is, very, probable, too, that, the, application, of, our, therapy, to, numbers, will, compel, us, to, alloy, the, pure, gold, of, analysis, plentifully, with, the, copper, of, direct, suggestion, only, a, handful, of, freud, s, followers, however, were, sufficiently, qualified, in, hypnosis, to, attempt, the, synthesis, their, work, had, a, limited, influence, on, the, hypno, therapeutic, approaches, now, known, variously, as, hypnotic, regression, hypnotic, progression, and, hypnoanalysis, mile, cou, 1857, 1926, assisted, ambroise, auguste, li, beault, for, around, two, years, at, nancy, after, practising, for, several, months, employing, the, hypnosis, of, li, beault, and, bernheim, s, nancy, school, he, abandoned, their, approach, altogether, later, cou, developed, a, new, approach, c, 1901, based, on, braid, style, hypnotism, direct, hypnotic, suggestion, and, ego, strengthening, which, eventually, became, known, as, la, m, thode, cou, according, to, charles, baudouin, cou, founded, what, became, known, as, the, new, nancy, school, a, loose, collaboration, of, practitioners, who, taught, and, promoted, his, views, cou, s, method, did, not, emphasise, sleep, or, deep, relaxation, but, instead, focused, upon, autosuggestion, involving, a, specific, series, of, suggestion, tests, although, cou, argued, that, he, was, no, longer, using, hypnosis, followers, such, as, charles, baudouin, viewed, his, approach, as, a, form, of, light, self, hypnosis, cou, s, method, became, a, self, help, and, psychotherapy, technique, which, contrasted, with, psychoanalysis, and, prefigured, self, hypnosis, and, cognitive, therapy, the, next, major, development, came, from, behavioural, psychology, in, american, university, research, clark, l, hull, 1884, 1952, an, american, psychologist, published, the, first, major, compilation, of, laboratory, studies, on, hypnosis, hypnosis, suggestibility, 1933, in, which, he, proved, that, hypnosis, and, sleep, had, nothing, in, common, hull, published, many, quantitative, findings, from, hypnosis, and, suggestion, experiments, and, encouraged, research, by, mainstream, psychologists, hull, s, behavioural, psychology, interpretation, of, hypnosis, emphasising, conditioned, reflexes, rivalled, the, freudian, psycho, dynamic, interpretation, which, emphasised, unconscious, transference, although, dave, elman, 1900, 1967, was, a, noted, radio, host, comedian, and, songwriter, he, also, made, a, name, as, a, hypnotist, he, led, many, courses, for, physicians, and, in, 1964, wrote, the, book, findings, in, hypnosis, later, to, be, retitled, hypnotherapy, published, by, westwood, publishing, perhaps, the, most, well, known, aspect, of, elman, s, legacy, is, his, method, of, induction, which, was, originally, fashioned, for, speed, work, and, later, adapted, for, the, use, of, medical, professionals, milton, erickson, 1901, 1980, the, founding, president, of, the, american, society, for, clinical, hypnosis, and, a, fellow, of, the, american, psychiatric, association, the, american, psychological, association, and, the, american, psychopathological, association, was, one, of, the, most, influential, post, war, hypnotherapists, he, wrote, several, books, and, journal, articles, on, the, subject, during, the, 1960s, erickson, popularised, a, new, branch, of, hypnotherapy, known, as, ericksonian, therapy, characterised, primarily, by, indirect, suggestion, metaphor, actually, analogies, confusion, techniques, and, double, binds, in, place, of, formal, hypnotic, inductions, however, the, difference, between, erickson, s, methods, and, traditional, hypnotism, led, contemporaries, such, as, andr, weitzenhoffer, to, question, whether, he, was, practising, hypnosis, at, all, and, his, approach, remains, in, question, erickson, had, no, hesitation, in, presenting, any, suggested, effect, as, being, hypnosis, whether, or, not, the, subject, was, in, a, hypnotic, state, in, fact, he, was, not, hesitant, in, passing, off, behaviour, that, was, dubiously, hypnotic, as, being, hypnotic, but, during, numerous, witnessed, and, recorded, encounters, in, clinical, experimental, and, academic, settings, erickson, was, able, to, evoke, examples, of, classic, hypnotic, phenomena, such, as, positive, and, negative, hallucinations, anesthesia, analgesia, in, childbirth, and, even, terminal, cancer, patients, catalepsy, regression, to, provable, events, in, subjects, early, lives, and, even, into, infantile, reflexology, erickson, stated, in, his, own, writings, that, there, was, no, correlation, between, hypnotic, depth, and, therapeutic, success, and, that, the, quality, of, the, applied, psychotherapy, outweighed, the, need, for, deep, hypnosis, in, many, cases, hypnotic, depth, was, to, be, pursued, for, research, purposes, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, two, factors, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, cognitive, behavioural, approach, to, hypnosis, although, cognitive, behavioural, theories, of, hypnosis, must, be, distinguished, from, cognitive, behavioural, approaches, to, hypnotherapy, they, share, similar, concepts, terminology, and, assumptions, and, have, been, integrated, by, influential, researchers, and, clinicians, such, as, irving, kirsch, steven, jay, lynn, and, others, at, the, outset, of, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, during, the, 1950s, hypnosis, was, used, by, early, behaviour, therapists, such, as, joseph, wolpe, and, also, by, early, cognitive, therapists, such, as, albert, ellis, barber, spanos, and, chaves, introduced, the, term, cognitive, behavioural, to, describe, their, nonstate, theory, of, hypnosis, in, hypnosis, imagination, and, human, potentialities, however, clark, l, hull, had, introduced, a, behavioural, psychology, as, far, back, as, 1933, which, in, turn, was, preceded, by, ivan, pavlov, indeed, the, earliest, theories, and, practices, of, hypnotism, even, those, of, braid, resemble, the, cognitive, behavioural, orientation, in, some, respects, a, person, in, a, state, of, hypnosis, has, focused, attention, and, has, increased, suggestibility, the, hypnotized, individual, appears, to, heed, only, the, communications, of, the, hypnotist, and, typically, responds, in, an, uncritical, automatic, fashion, while, ignoring, all, aspects, of, the, environment, other, than, those, pointed, out, by, the, hypnotist, in, a, hypnotic, state, an, individual, tends, to, see, feel, smell, and, otherwise, perceive, in, accordance, with, the, hypnotist, s, suggestions, even, though, these, suggestions, may, be, in, apparent, contradiction, to, the, actual, stimuli, present, in, the, environment, the, effects, of, hypnosis, are, not, limited, to, sensory, change, even, the, subject, s, memory, and, awareness, of, self, may, be, altered, by, suggestion, and, the, effects, of, the, suggestions, may, be, extended, post, hypnotically, into, the, subject, s, subsequent, waking, activity, it, could, be, said, that, hypnotic, suggestion, is, explicitly, intended, to, make, use, of, the, placebo, effect, for, example, in, 1994, irving, kirsch, characterized, hypnosis, as, a, non, deceptive, placebo, i, e, a, method, that, openly, makes, use, of, suggestion, and, employs, methods, to, amplify, its, effects, a, definition, of, hypnosis, derived, from, academic, psychology, was, provided, in, 2005, when, the, society, for, psychological, hypnosis, division, 30, of, the, american, psychological, association, apa, published, the, following, formal, definition, hypnosis, typically, involves, an, introduction, to, the, procedure, during, which, the, subject, is, told, that, suggestions, for, imaginative, experiences, will, be, presented, the, hypnotic, induction, is, an, extended, initial, suggestion, for, using, one, s, imagination, and, may, contain, further, elaborations, of, the, introduction, a, hypnotic, procedure, is, used, to, encourage, and, evaluate, responses, to, suggestions, when, using, hypnosis, one, person, the, subject, is, guided, by, another, the, hypnotist, to, respond, to, suggestions, for, changes, in, subjective, experience, alterations, in, perception, sensation, emotion, thought, or, behavior, persons, can, also, learn, self, hypnosis, which, is, the, act, of, administering, hypnotic, procedures, on, one, s, own, if, the, subject, responds, to, hypnotic, suggestions, it, is, generally, inferred, that, hypnosis, has, been, induced, many, believe, that, hypnotic, responses, and, experiences, are, characteristic, of, a, hypnotic, state, while, some, think, that, it, is, not, necessary, to, use, the, word, hypnosis, as, part, of, the, hypnotic, induction, others, view, it, as, essential, michael, nash, provides, a, list, of, eight, definitions, of, hypnosis, by, different, authors, in, addition, to, his, own, view, that, hypnosis, is, a, special, case, of, psychological, regression, joe, griffin, and, ivan, tyrrell, the, originators, of, the, human, givens, approach, define, hypnosis, as, any, artificial, way, of, accessing, the, rem, state, the, same, brain, state, in, which, dreaming, occurs, and, suggest, that, this, definition, when, properly, understood, resolves, many, of, the, mysteries, and, controversies, surrounding, hypnosis, they, see, the, rem, state, as, being, vitally, important, for, life, itself, for, programming, in, our, instinctive, knowledge, initially, after, dement, and, jouvet, and, then, for, adding, to, this, throughout, life, they, attempt, to, explain, this, by, asserting, that, in, a, sense, all, learning, is, post, hypnotic, which, they, say, explains, why, the, number, of, ways, people, can, be, put, into, a, hypnotic, state, are, so, varied, according, to, them, anything, that, focuses, a, person, s, attention, inward, or, outward, puts, them, into, a, trance, hypnosis, is, normally, preceded, by, a, hypnotic, induction, technique, traditionally, this, was, interpreted, as, a, method, of, putting, the, subject, into, a, hypnotic, trance, however, subsequent, nonstate, theorists, have, viewed, it, differently, seeing, it, as, a, means, of, heightening, client, expectation, defining, their, role, focusing, attention, etc, the, induction, techniques, and, methods, are, dependent, on, the, depth, of, hypnotic, trance, level, and, for, each, stage, of, trance, the, number, of, which, in, some, sources, ranges, from, 30, stages, to, 50, stages, there, are, different, types, of, inductions, there, are, several, different, induction, techniques, one, of, the, most, influential, methods, was, braid, s, eye, fixation, technique, also, known, as, braidism, many, variations, of, the, eye, fixation, approach, exist, including, the, induction, used, in, the, stanford, hypnotic, susceptibility, scale, shss, the, most, widely, used, research, tool, in, the, field, of, hypnotism, braid, s, original, description, of, his, induction, is, as, follows, take, any, bright, object, e, g, a, lancet, case, between, the, thumb, and, fore, and, middle, fingers, of, the, left, hand, hold, it, from, about, eight, to, fifteen, inches, from, the, eyes, at, such, position, above, the, forehead, as, may, be, necessary, to, produce, the, greatest, possible, strain, upon, the, eyes, and, eyelids, and, enable, the, patient, to, maintain, a, steady, fixed, stare, at, the, object, the, patient, must, be, made, to, understand, that, he, is, to, keep, the, eyes, steadily, fixed, on, the, object, and, the, mind, riveted, on, the, idea, of, that, one, object, it, will, be, observed, that, owing, to, the, consensual, adjustment, of, the, eyes, the, pupils, will, be, at, first, contracted, they, will, shortly, begin, to, dilate, and, after, they, have, done, so, to, a, considerable, extent, and, have, assumed, a, wavy, motion, if, the, fore, and, middle, fingers, of, the, right, hand, extended, and, a, little, separated, are, carried, from, the, object, toward, the, eyes, most, probably, the, eyelids, will, close, involuntarily, with, a, vibratory, motion, if, this, is, not, the, case, or, the, patient, allows, the, eyeballs, to, move, desire, him, to, begin, anew, giving, him, to, understand, that, he, is, to, allow, the, eyelids, to, close, when, the, fingers, are, again, carried, towards, the, eyes, but, that, the, eyeballs, must, be, kept, fixed, in, the, same, position, and, the, mind, riveted, to, the, one, idea, of, the, object, held, above, the, eyes, in, general, it, will, be, found, that, the, eyelids, close, with, a, vibratory, motion, or, become, spasmodically, closed, braid, later, acknowledged, that, the, hypnotic, induction, technique, was, not, necessary, in, every, case, and, subsequent, researchers, have, generally, found, that, on, average, it, contributes, less, than, previously, expected, to, the, effect, of, hypnotic, suggestions, variations, and, alternatives, to, the, original, hypnotic, induction, techniques, were, subsequently, developed, however, this, method, is, still, considered, authoritative, in, 1941, robert, white, wrote, it, can, be, safely, stated, that, nine, out, of, ten, hypnotic, techniques, call, for, reclining, posture, muscular, relaxation, and, optical, fixation, followed, by, eye, closure, when, james, braid, first, described, hypnotism, he, did, not, use, the, term, suggestion, but, referred, instead, to, the, act, of, focusing, the, conscious, mind, of, the, subject, upon, a, single, dominant, idea, braid, s, main, therapeutic, strategy, involved, stimulating, or, reducing, physiological, functioning, in, different, regions, of, the, body, in, his, later, works, however, braid, placed, increasing, emphasis, upon, the, use, of, a, variety, of, different, verbal, and, non, verbal, forms, of, suggestion, including, the, use, of, waking, suggestion, and, self, hypnosis, subsequently, hippolyte, bernheim, shifted, the, emphasis, from, the, physical, state, of, hypnosis, on, to, the, psychological, process, of, verbal, suggestion, i, define, hypnotism, as, the, induction, of, a, peculiar, psychical, condition, which, increases, the, susceptibility, to, suggestion, often, it, is, true, the, sleep, that, may, be, induced, facilitates, suggestion, but, it, is, not, the, necessary, preliminary, it, is, suggestion, that, rules, hypnotism, bernheim, s, conception, of, the, primacy, of, verbal, suggestion, in, hypnotism, dominated, the, subject, throughout, the, 20th, century, leading, some, authorities, to, declare, him, the, father, of, modern, hypnotism, contemporary, hypnotism, uses, a, variety, of, suggestion, forms, including, direct, verbal, suggestions, indirect, verbal, suggestions, such, as, requests, or, insinuations, metaphors, and, other, rhetorical, figures, of, speech, and, non, verbal, suggestion, in, the, form, of, mental, imagery, voice, tonality, and, physical, manipulation, a, distinction, is, commonly, made, between, suggestions, delivered, permissively, and, those, delivered, in, a, more, authoritarian, manner, harvard, hypnotherapist, deirdre, barrett, writes, that, most, modern, research, suggestions, are, designed, to, bring, about, immediate, responses, whereas, hypnotherapeutic, suggestions, are, usually, post, hypnotic, ones, that, are, intended, to, trigger, responses, affecting, behaviour, for, periods, ranging, from, days, to, a, lifetime, in, duration, the, hypnotherapeutic, ones, are, often, repeated, in, multiple, sessions, before, they, achieve, peak, effectiveness, some, hypnotists, view, suggestion, as, a, form, of, communication, that, is, directed, primarily, to, the, subject, s, conscious, mind, whereas, others, view, it, as, a, means, of, communicating, with, the, unconscious, or, subconscious, mind, these, concepts, were, introduced, into, hypnotism, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, by, sigmund, freud, and, pierre, janet, sigmund, freud, s, psychoanalytic, theory, describes, conscious, thoughts, as, being, at, the, surface, of, the, mind, and, unconscious, processes, as, being, deeper, in, the, mind, braid, bernheim, and, other, victorian, pioneers, of, hypnotism, did, not, refer, to, the, unconscious, mind, but, saw, hypnotic, suggestions, as, being, addressed, to, the, subject, s, conscious, mind, indeed, braid, actually, defines, hypnotism, as, focused, conscious, attention, upon, a, dominant, idea, or, suggestion, different, views, regarding, the, nature, of, the, mind, have, led, to, different, conceptions, of, suggestion, hypnotists, who, believe, that, responses, are, mediated, primarily, by, an, unconscious, mind, like, milton, erickson, make, use, of, indirect, suggestions, such, as, metaphors, or, stories, whose, intended, meaning, may, be, concealed, from, the, subject, s, conscious, mind, the, concept, of, subliminal, suggestion, depends, upon, this, view, of, the, mind, by, contrast, hypnotists, who, believe, that, responses, to, suggestion, are, primarily, mediated, by, the, conscious, mind, such, as, theodore, barber, and, nicholas, spanos, have, tended, to, make, more, use, of, direct, verbal, suggestions, and, instructions, the, first, neuropsychological, theory, of, hypnotic, suggestion, was, introduced, early, by, james, braid, who, adopted, his, friend, and, colleague, william, carpenter, s, theory, of, the, ideo, motor, reflex, response, to, account, for, the, phenomenon, of, hypnotism, carpenter, had, observed, from, close, examination, of, everyday, experience, that, under, certain, circumstances, the, mere, idea, of, a, muscular, movement, could, be, sufficient, to, produce, a, reflexive, or, automatic, contraction, or, movement, of, the, muscles, involved, albeit, in, a, very, small, degree, braid, extended, carpenter, s, theory, to, encompass, the, observation, that, a, wide, variety, of, bodily, responses, besides, muscular, movement, can, be, thus, affected, for, example, the, idea, of, sucking, a, lemon, can, automatically, stimulate, salivation, a, secretory, response, braid, therefore, adopted, the, term, ideo, dynamic, meaning, by, the, power, of, an, idea, to, explain, a, broad, range, of, psycho, physiological, mind, body, phenomena, braid, coined, the, term, mono, ideodynamic, to, refer, to, the, theory, that, hypnotism, operates, by, concentrating, attention, on, a, single, idea, in, order, to, amplify, the, ideo, dynamic, reflex, response, variations, of, the, basic, ideo, motor, or, ideo, dynamic, theory, of, suggestion, have, continued, to, exercise, considerable, influence, over, subsequent, theories, of, hypnosis, including, those, of, clark, l, hull, hans, eysenck, and, ernest, rossi, in, victorian, psychology, the, word, idea, encompasses, any, mental, representation, including, mental, imagery, memories, etc, braid, made, a, rough, distinction, between, different, stages, of, hypnosis, which, he, termed, the, first, and, second, conscious, stage, of, hypnotism, he, later, replaced, this, with, a, distinction, between, sub, hypnotic, full, hypnotic, and, hypnotic, coma, stages, jean, martin, charcot, made, a, similar, distinction, between, stages, which, he, named, somnambulism, lethargy, and, catalepsy, however, ambroise, auguste, li, beault, and, hippolyte, bernheim, introduced, more, complex, hypnotic, depth, scales, based, on, a, combination, of, behavioural, physiological, and, subjective, responses, some, of, which, were, due, to, direct, suggestion, and, some, of, which, were, not, in, the, first, few, decades, of, the, 20th, century, these, early, clinical, depth, scales, were, superseded, by, more, sophisticated, hypnotic, susceptibility, scales, based, on, experimental, research, the, most, influential, were, the, davis, husband, and, friedlander, sarbin, scales, developed, in, the, 1930s, andr, weitzenhoffer, and, ernest, r, hilgard, developed, the, stanford, scale, of, hypnotic, susceptibility, in, 1959, consisting, of, 12, suggestion, test, items, following, a, standardised, hypnotic, eye, fixation, induction, script, and, this, has, become, one, of, the, most, widely, referenced, research, tools, in, the, field, of, hypnosis, soon, after, in, 1962, ronald, shor, and, emily, carota, orne, developed, a, similar, group, scale, called, the, harvard, group, scale, of, hypnotic, susceptibility, hgshs, whereas, the, older, depth, scales, tried, to, infer, the, level, of, hypnotic, trance, from, supposed, observable, signs, such, as, spontaneous, amnesia, most, subsequent, scales, have, measured, the, degree, of, observed, or, self, evaluated, responsiveness, to, specific, suggestion, tests, such, as, direct, suggestions, of, arm, rigidity, catalepsy, the, stanford, harvard, hip, and, most, other, susceptibility, scales, convert, numbers, into, an, assessment, of, a, person, s, susceptibility, as, high, medium, or, low, approximately, 80, of, the, population, are, medium, 10, are, high, and, 10, are, low, there, is, some, controversy, as, to, whether, this, is, distributed, on, a, normal, bell, shaped, curve, or, whether, it, is, bi, modal, with, a, small, blip, of, people, at, the, high, end, hypnotisability, scores, are, highly, stable, over, a, person, s, lifetime, research, by, deirdre, barrett, has, found, that, there, are, two, distinct, types, of, highly, susceptible, subjects, which, she, terms, fantasisers, and, dissociaters, fantasisers, score, high, on, absorption, scales, find, it, easy, to, block, out, real, world, stimuli, without, hypnosis, spend, much, time, daydreaming, report, imaginary, companions, as, a, child, and, grew, up, with, parents, who, encouraged, imaginary, play, dissociaters, often, have, a, history, of, childhood, abuse, or, other, trauma, learned, to, escape, into, numbness, and, to, forget, unpleasant, events, their, association, to, daydreaming, was, often, going, blank, rather, than, creating, vividly, recalled, fantasies, both, score, equally, high, on, formal, scales, of, hypnotic, susceptibility, individuals, with, dissociative, identity, disorder, have, the, highest, hypnotisability, of, any, clinical, group, followed, by, those, with, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, there, are, numerous, applications, for, hypnosis, across, multiple, fields, of, interest, including, medical, psychotherapeutic, uses, military, uses, self, improvement, and, entertainment, the, american, medical, association, currently, has, no, official, stance, on, the, medical, use, of, hypnosis, hypnosis, has, been, used, as, a, supplemental, approach, to, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, since, as, early, as, 1949, hypnosis, was, defined, in, relation, to, classical, conditioning, where, the, words, of, the, therapist, were, the, stimuli, and, the, hypnosis, would, be, the, conditioned, response, some, traditional, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, methods, were, based, in, classical, conditioning, it, would, include, inducing, a, relaxed, state, and, introducing, a, feared, stimulus, one, way, of, inducing, the, relaxed, state, was, through, hypnosis, hypnotism, has, also, been, used, in, forensics, sports, education, physical, therapy, and, rehabilitation, hypnotism, has, also, been, employed, by, artists, for, creative, purposes, most, notably, the, surrealist, circle, of, andr, breton, who, employed, hypnosis, automatic, writing, and, sketches, for, creative, purposes, hypnotic, methods, have, been, used, to, re, experience, drug, states, and, mystical, experiences, self, hypnosis, is, popularly, used, to, quit, smoking, alleviate, stress, and, anxiety, promote, weight, loss, and, induce, sleep, hypnosis, stage, hypnosis, can, persuade, people, to, perform, unusual, public, feats, some, people, have, drawn, analogies, between, certain, aspects, of, hypnotism, and, areas, such, as, crowd, psychology, religious, hysteria, and, ritual, trances, in, preliterate, tribal, cultures, hypnotherapy, is, a, use, of, hypnosis, in, psychotherapy, it, is, used, by, licensed, physicians, psychologists, and, others, physicians, and, psychologists, may, use, hypnosis, to, treat, depression, anxiety, eating, disorders, sleep, disorders, compulsive, gambling, phobias, and, post, traumatic, stress, while, certified, hypnotherapists, who, are, not, physicians, or, psychologists, often, treat, smoking, and, weight, management, hypnotherapy, was, historically, used, in, psychiatric, and, legal, settings, to, enhance, the, recall, of, repressed, or, degraded, memories, but, this, application, of, the, technique, has, declined, as, scientific, evidence, accumulated, that, hypnotherapy, can, increase, confidence, in, false, memories, hypnotherapy, is, viewed, as, a, helpful, adjunct, by, proponents, having, additive, effects, when, treating, psychological, disorders, such, as, these, along, with, scientifically, proven, cognitive, therapies, the, effectiveness, of, hypnotherapy, has, not, yet, been, accurately, assessed, and, due, to, the, lack, of, evidence, indicating, any, level, of, efficiency, it, is, regarded, as, a, type, of, alternative, medicine, by, numerous, reputable, medical, organisations, such, as, the, national, health, service, preliminary, research, has, expressed, brief, hypnosis, interventions, as, possibly, being, a, useful, tool, for, managing, painful, hiv, dsp, because, of, its, history, of, usefulness, in, pain, management, its, long, term, effectiveness, of, brief, interventions, the, ability, to, teach, self, hypnosis, to, patients, the, cost, effectiveness, of, the, intervention, and, the, advantage, of, using, such, an, intervention, as, opposed, to, the, use, of, pharmaceutical, drugs, modern, hypnotherapy, has, been, used, with, varying, success, in, a, variety, of, forms, such, as, in, a, january, 2001, article, in, psychology, today, harvard, psychologist, deirdre, barrett, wrote, a, hypnotic, trance, is, not, therapeutic, in, and, of, itself, but, specific, suggestions, and, images, fed, to, clients, in, a, trance, can, profoundly, alter, their, behavior, as, they, rehearse, the, new, ways, they, want, to, think, and, feel, they, lay, the, groundwork, for, changes, in, their, future, actions, barrett, described, specific, ways, this, is, operationalised, for, habit, change, and, amelioration, of, phobias, in, her, 1998, book, of, hypnotherapy, case, studies, she, reviews, the, clinical, research, on, hypnosis, with, dissociative, disorders, smoking, cessation, and, insomnia, and, describes, successful, treatments, of, these, complaints, in, a, july, 2001, article, for, scientific, american, titled, the, truth, and, the, hype, of, hypnosis, michael, nash, wrote, that, using, hypnosis, scientists, have, temporarily, created, hallucinations, compulsions, certain, types, of, memory, loss, false, memories, and, delusions, in, the, laboratory, so, that, these, phenomena, can, be, studied, in, a, controlled, environment, there, is, evidence, supporting, the, use, of, hypnotherapy, in, the, treatment, of, menopause, related, symptoms, including, hot, flashes, the, north, american, menopause, society, recommends, hypnotherapy, for, the, nonhormonal, management, of, menopause, associated, vasomotor, symptoms, giving, it, the, highest, level, of, evidence, hypnotherapy, has, been, studied, for, the, treatment, of, irritable, bowel, syndrome, hypnosis, for, ibs, has, received, moderate, support, in, the, national, institute, for, health, and, clinical, excellence, guidance, published, for, uk, health, services, it, has, been, used, as, an, aid, or, alternative, to, chemical, anesthesia, and, it, has, been, studied, as, a, way, to, soothe, skin, ailments, a, number, of, studies, show, that, hypnosis, can, reduce, the, pain, experienced, during, burn, wound, debridement, bone, marrow, aspirations, and, childbirth, the, international, journal, of, clinical, and, experimental, hypnosis, found, that, hypnosis, relieved, the, pain, of, 75, of, 933, subjects, participating, in, 27, different, experiments, hypnosis, is, effective, in, decreasing, the, fear, of, cancer, treatment, reducing, pain, from, and, coping, with, cancer, and, other, chronic, conditions, nausea, and, other, symptoms, related, to, incurable, diseases, may, also, be, managed, with, hypnosis, some, practitioners, have, claimed, hypnosis, might, help, boost, the, immune, system, of, people, with, cancer, however, according, to, the, american, cancer, society, available, scientific, evidence, does, not, support, the, idea, that, hypnosis, can, influence, the, development, or, progression, of, cancer, hypnosis, has, been, used, as, a, pain, relieving, technique, during, dental, surgery, and, related, pain, management, regimens, as, well, researchers, like, jerjes, and, his, team, have, reported, that, hypnosis, can, help, even, those, patients, who, have, acute, to, severe, orodental, pain, additionally, meyerson, and, uziel, have, suggested, that, hypnotic, methods, have, been, found, to, be, highly, fruitful, for, alleviating, anxiety, in, patients, with, severe, dental, phobia, for, some, psychologists, who, uphold, the, altered, state, theory, of, hypnosis, pain, relief, in, response, to, hypnosis, is, said, to, be, the, result, of, the, brain, s, dual, processing, functionality, this, effect, is, obtained, either, through, the, process, of, selective, attention, or, dissociation, in, which, both, theories, involve, the, presence, of, activity, in, pain, receptive, regions, of, the, brain, and, a, difference, in, the, processing, of, the, stimuli, by, the, hypnotised, subject, the, american, psychological, association, published, a, study, comparing, the, effects, of, hypnosis, ordinary, suggestion, and, placebo, in, reducing, pain, the, study, found, that, highly, suggestible, individuals, experienced, a, greater, reduction, in, pain, from, hypnosis, compared, with, placebo, whereas, less, suggestible, subjects, experienced, no, pain, reduction, from, hypnosis, when, compared, with, placebo, ordinary, non, hypnotic, suggestion, also, caused, reduction, in, pain, compared, to, placebo, but, was, able, to, reduce, pain, in, a, wider, range, of, subjects, both, high, and, low, suggestible, than, hypnosis, the, results, showed, that, it, is, primarily, the, subject, s, responsiveness, to, suggestion, whether, within, the, context, of, hypnosis, or, not, that, is, the, main, determinant, of, causing, reduction, in, pain, the, success, rate, for, habit, control, is, varied, a, meta, study, researching, hypnosis, as, a, quit, smoking, tool, found, it, had, a, 20, to, 30, percent, success, rate, while, a, 2007, study, of, patients, hospitalised, for, cardiac, and, pulmonary, ailments, found, that, smokers, who, used, hypnosis, to, quit, smoking, doubled, their, chances, of, success, in, 2019, a, cochrane, review, was, unable, to, find, evidence, of, benefit, of, hypnosis, in, smoking, cessation, and, suggested, if, there, is, it, is, small, at, best, hypnosis, may, be, useful, as, an, adjunct, therapy, for, weight, loss, a, 1996, meta, analysis, studying, hypnosis, combined, with, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, found, that, people, using, both, treatments, lost, more, weight, than, people, using, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, alone, the, virtual, gastric, band, procedure, mixes, hypnosis, with, hypnopedia, the, hypnosis, instructs, the, stomach, that, it, is, smaller, than, it, really, is, and, hypnopedia, reinforces, alimentary, habits, a, 2016, pilot, study, found, that, there, was, no, significant, difference, in, effectiveness, between, vgb, hypnotherapy, and, relaxation, hypnotherapy, american, psychiatric, nurses, in, most, medical, facilities, are, allowed, to, administer, hypnosis, to, patients, in, order, to, relieve, symptoms, such, as, anxiety, arousal, negative, behaviours, uncontrollable, behaviour, and, to, improve, self, esteem, and, confidence, this, is, permitted, only, when, they, have, been, completely, trained, about, their, clinical, side, effects, and, while, under, supervision, when, administering, it, the, use, of, hypnosis, to, exhume, information, thought, to, be, buried, within, the, mind, in, the, investigative, process, and, as, evidence, in, court, became, increasingly, popular, from, the, 1950s, to, the, early, 1980s, with, its, use, being, debated, into, the, 1990s, when, its, popular, use, mostly, diminished, forensic, hypnosis, s, uses, are, hindered, by, concerns, with, its, reliability, and, accuracy, controversy, surrounds, the, use, of, hypnotherapy, to, retrieve, memories, especially, those, from, early, childhood, the, american, medical, association, and, the, american, psychological, association, caution, against, recovered, memory, therapy, in, cases, of, alleged, childhood, trauma, stating, that, it, is, impossible, without, corroborative, evidence, to, distinguish, a, true, memory, from, a, false, one, past, life, regression, is, regarded, as, pseudoscience, a, 2006, declassified, 1966, document, obtained, by, the, us, freedom, of, information, act, archive, shows, that, hypnosis, was, investigated, for, military, applications, the, full, paper, explores, the, potentials, of, operational, uses, the, overall, conclusion, of, the, study, was, that, there, was, no, evidence, that, hypnosis, could, be, used, for, military, applications, and, no, clear, evidence, whether, hypnosis, is, a, definable, phenomenon, outside, ordinary, suggestion, motivation, and, subject, expectancy, according, to, the, document, the, use, of, hypnosis, in, intelligence, would, present, certain, technical, problems, not, encountered, in, the, clinic, or, laboratory, to, obtain, compliance, from, a, resistant, source, for, example, it, would, be, necessary, to, hypnotise, the, source, under, essentially, hostile, circumstances, there, is, no, good, evidence, clinical, or, experimental, that, this, can, be, done, furthermore, the, document, states, that, it, would, be, difficult, to, find, an, area, of, scientific, interest, more, beset, by, divided, professional, opinion, and, contradictory, experimental, evidence, no, one, can, say, whether, hypnosis, is, a, qualitatively, unique, state, with, some, physiological, and, conditioned, response, components, or, only, a, form, of, suggestion, induced, by, high, motivation, and, a, positive, relationship, between, hypnotist, and, subject, t, x, barber, has, produced, hypnotic, deafness, and, hypnotic, blindness, analgesia, and, other, responses, seen, in, hypnosis, all, without, hypnotising, anyone, orne, has, shown, that, unhypnotised, persons, can, be, motivated, to, equal, and, surpass, the, supposed, superhuman, physical, feats, seen, in, hypnosis, the, study, concluded, that, there, are, no, reliable, accounts, of, its, effective, use, by, an, intelligence, service, in, history, research, into, hypnosis, in, military, applications, is, further, verified, by, the, project, mkultra, experiments, also, conducted, by, the, cia, according, to, congressional, testimony, the, cia, experimented, with, utilising, lsd, and, hypnosis, for, mind, control, many, of, these, programs, were, done, domestically, and, on, participants, who, were, not, informed, of, the, study, s, purposes, or, that, they, would, be, given, drugs, self, hypnosis, happens, when, a, person, hypnotises, oneself, commonly, involving, the, use, of, autosuggestion, the, technique, is, often, used, to, increase, motivation, for, a, diet, to, quit, smoking, or, to, reduce, stress, people, who, practise, self, hypnosis, sometimes, require, assistance, some, people, use, devices, known, as, mind, machines, to, assist, in, the, process, whereas, others, use, hypnotic, recordings, self, hypnosis, is, claimed, to, help, with, stage, fright, relaxation, and, physical, well, being, stage, hypnosis, is, a, form, of, entertainment, traditionally, employed, in, a, club, or, theatre, before, an, audience, due, to, stage, hypnotists, showmanship, many, people, believe, that, hypnosis, is, a, form, of, mind, control, stage, hypnotists, typically, attempt, to, hypnotise, the, entire, audience, and, then, select, individuals, who, are, under, to, come, up, on, stage, and, perform, embarrassing, acts, while, the, audience, watches, however, the, effects, of, stage, hypnosis, are, probably, due, to, a, combination, of, psychological, factors, participant, selection, suggestibility, physical, manipulation, stagecraft, and, trickery, the, desire, to, be, the, centre, of, attention, having, an, excuse, to, violate, their, own, fear, suppressors, and, the, pressure, to, please, are, thought, to, convince, subjects, to, play, along, books, by, stage, hypnotists, sometimes, explicitly, describe, the, use, of, deception, in, their, acts, for, example, ormond, mcgill, s, new, encyclopedia, of, stage, hypnotism, describes, an, entire, fake, hypnosis, act, that, depends, upon, the, use, of, private, whispers, throughout, the, idea, of, music, as, hypnosis, developed, from, the, work, of, franz, mesmer, instruments, such, as, pianos, violins, harps, and, especially, the, glass, harmonica, often, featured, in, mesmer, s, treatments, and, were, considered, to, contribute, to, mesmer, s, success, hypnotic, music, became, an, important, part, in, the, development, of, a, physiological, psychology, that, regarded, the, hypnotic, state, as, an, automatic, phenomenon, that, links, to, physical, reflex, in, their, experiments, with, sound, hypnosis, jean, martin, charcot, used, gongs, and, tuning, forks, and, ivan, pavlov, used, bells, the, intention, behind, their, experiments, was, to, prove, that, physiological, response, to, sound, could, be, automatic, bypassing, the, conscious, mind, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, a, moral, panic, took, place, in, the, us, fearing, satanic, ritual, abuse, as, part, of, this, certain, books, such, as, the, devil, s, disciples, claimed, that, some, bands, particularly, in, the, musical, genre, of, heavy, metal, brainwashed, american, teenagers, with, subliminal, messages, to, lure, them, into, the, worship, of, the, devil, sexual, immorality, murder, and, especially, suicide, various, people, have, been, suspected, of, or, convicted, for, hypnosis, related, crimes, including, robbery, and, sexual, abuse, in, 1951, palle, hardrup, shot, and, killed, two, people, during, a, botched, robbery, in, copenhagen, see, hypnosis, murders, hardrup, claimed, that, his, friend, and, former, cellmate, bj, rn, schouw, nielsen, had, hypnotised, him, to, commit, the, robbery, inadvertently, causing, the, deaths, both, were, sentenced, to, jail, time, in, 2011, a, russian, evil, hypnotist, was, suspected, of, tricking, customers, in, banks, around, stavropol, into, giving, away, thousands, of, pounds, worth, of, money, according, to, the, local, police, he, would, approach, them, and, make, them, withdraw, all, of, the, money, from, their, bank, accounts, which, they, would, then, freely, give, to, the, man, a, similar, incident, was, reported, in, london, in, 2014, where, a, video, seemingly, showed, a, robber, hypnotising, a, shopkeeper, before, robbing, him, the, victim, did, nothing, to, stop, the, robber, from, looting, his, pockets, and, taking, his, cash, only, calling, out, the, thief, when, he, was, already, getting, away, in, 2013, the, then, 40, year, old, amateur, hypnotist, timothy, porter, attempted, to, sexually, abuse, his, female, weight, loss, client, she, reported, awaking, from, a, trance, and, finding, him, behind, her, with, his, pants, down, telling, her, to, touch, herself, he, was, subsequently, called, to, court, and, included, on, the, sex, offender, list, in, 2015, gary, naraido, then, 52, was, sentenced, to, 10, years, in, prison, for, several, hypnosis, related, sexual, abuse, charges, besides, the, primary, charge, by, a, 22, year, old, woman, who, he, sexually, abused, in, a, hotel, under, the, guise, of, a, free, therapy, session, he, also, admitted, to, having, sexually, assaulted, a, 14, year, old, girl, in, december, 2018, a, brazilian, medium, named, jo, o, teixeira, de, faria, also, known, as, jo, o, de, deus, famous, for, performing, spiritual, surgeries, through, hypnosis, techniques, was, accused, of, sexual, abuse, by, 12, women, in, 2016, an, ohio, lawyer, was, sentenced, to, 12, years, of, prison, after, hypnotizing, a, dozen, different, clients, into, committing, sexual, acts, under, the, guise, of, a, mindfulness, exercise, the, central, theoretical, disagreement, regarding, hypnosis, is, known, as, the, state, versus, nonstate, debate, when, braid, introduced, the, concept, of, hypnotism, he, equivocated, over, the, nature, of, the, state, sometimes, describing, it, as, a, specific, sleep, like, neurological, state, comparable, to, animal, hibernation, or, yogic, meditation, while, at, other, times, he, emphasised, that, hypnotism, encompasses, a, number, of, different, stages, or, states, that, are, an, extension, of, ordinary, psychological, and, physiological, processes, overall, braid, appears, to, have, moved, from, a, more, special, state, understanding, of, hypnotism, toward, a, more, complex, nonstate, orientation, state, theorists, interpret, the, effects, of, hypnotism, as, due, primarily, to, a, specific, abnormal, and, uniform, psychological, or, physiological, state, of, some, description, often, referred, to, as, hypnotic, trance, or, an, altered, state, of, consciousness, nonstate, theorists, rejected, the, idea, of, hypnotic, trance, and, interpret, the, effects, of, hypnotism, as, due, to, a, combination, of, multiple, task, specific, factors, derived, from, normal, cognitive, behavioural, and, social, psychology, such, as, social, role, perception, and, favorable, motivation, sarbin, active, imagination, and, positive, cognitive, set, barber, response, expectancy, kirsch, and, the, active, use, of, task, specific, subjective, strategies, spanos, the, personality, psychologist, robert, white, is, often, cited, as, providing, one, of, the, first, nonstate, definitions, of, hypnosis, in, a, 1941, article, hypnotic, behaviour, is, meaningful, goal, directed, striving, its, most, general, goal, being, to, behave, like, a, hypnotised, person, as, this, is, continuously, defined, by, the, operator, and, understood, by, the, client, put, simply, it, is, often, claimed, that, whereas, the, older, special, state, interpretation, emphasises, the, difference, between, hypnosis, and, ordinary, psychological, processes, the, nonstate, interpretation, emphasises, their, similarity, comparisons, between, hypnotised, and, non, hypnotised, subjects, suggest, that, if, a, hypnotic, trance, does, exist, it, only, accounts, for, a, small, proportion, of, the, effects, attributed, to, hypnotic, suggestion, most, of, which, can, be, replicated, without, hypnotic, induction, braid, can, be, taken, to, imply, in, later, writings, that, hypnosis, is, largely, a, state, of, heightened, suggestibility, induced, by, expectation, and, focused, attention, in, particular, hippolyte, bernheim, became, known, as, the, leading, proponent, of, the, suggestion, theory, of, hypnosis, at, one, point, going, so, far, as, to, declare, that, there, is, no, hypnotic, state, only, heightened, suggestibility, there, is, a, general, consensus, that, heightened, suggestibility, is, an, essential, characteristic, of, hypnosis, in, 1933, clark, l, hull, wrote, if, a, subject, after, submitting, to, the, hypnotic, procedure, shows, no, genuine, increase, in, susceptibility, to, any, suggestions, whatever, there, seems, no, point, in, calling, him, hypnotised, regardless, of, how, fully, and, readily, he, may, respond, to, suggestions, of, lid, closure, and, other, superficial, sleeping, behaviour, ivan, pavlov, stated, that, hypnotic, suggestion, provided, the, best, example, of, a, conditioned, reflex, response, in, human, beings, i, e, that, responses, to, suggestions, were, learned, associations, triggered, by, the, words, used, speech, on, account, of, the, whole, preceding, life, of, the, adult, is, connected, up, with, all, the, internal, and, external, stimuli, which, can, reach, the, cortex, signaling, all, of, them, and, replacing, all, of, them, and, therefore, it, can, call, forth, all, those, reactions, of, the, organism, which, are, normally, determined, by, the, actual, stimuli, themselves, we, can, therefore, regard, suggestion, as, the, most, simple, form, of, a, typical, reflex, in, man, he, also, believed, that, hypnosis, was, a, partial, sleep, meaning, that, a, generalised, inhibition, of, cortical, functioning, could, be, encouraged, to, spread, throughout, regions, of, the, brain, he, observed, that, the, various, degrees, of, hypnosis, did, not, significantly, differ, physiologically, from, the, waking, state, and, hypnosis, depended, on, insignificant, changes, of, environmental, stimuli, pavlov, also, suggested, that, lower, brain, stem, mechanisms, were, involved, in, hypnotic, conditioning, pavlov, s, ideas, combined, with, those, of, his, rival, vladimir, bekhterev, and, became, the, basis, of, hypnotic, psychotherapy, in, the, soviet, union, as, documented, in, the, writings, of, his, follower, k, i, platonov, soviet, theories, of, hypnotism, subsequently, influenced, the, writings, of, western, behaviourally, oriented, hypnotherapists, such, as, andrew, salter, changes, in, brain, activity, have, been, found, in, some, studies, of, highly, responsive, hypnotic, subjects, these, changes, vary, depending, upon, the, type, of, suggestions, being, given, the, state, of, light, to, medium, hypnosis, where, the, body, undergoes, physical, and, mental, relaxation, is, associated, with, a, pattern, mostly, of, alpha, waves, however, what, these, results, indicate, is, unclear, they, may, indicate, that, suggestions, genuinely, produce, changes, in, perception, or, experience, that, are, not, simply, a, result, of, imagination, however, in, normal, circumstances, without, hypnosis, the, brain, regions, associated, with, motion, detection, are, activated, both, when, motion, is, seen, and, when, motion, is, imagined, without, any, changes, in, the, subjects, perception, or, experience, this, may, therefore, indicate, that, highly, suggestible, hypnotic, subjects, are, simply, activating, to, a, greater, extent, the, areas, of, the, brain, used, in, imagination, without, real, perceptual, changes, it, is, however, premature, to, claim, that, hypnosis, and, meditation, are, mediated, by, similar, brain, systems, and, neural, mechanisms, another, study, has, demonstrated, that, a, colour, hallucination, suggestion, given, to, subjects, in, hypnosis, activated, colour, processing, regions, of, the, occipital, cortex, a, 2004, review, of, research, examining, the, eeg, laboratory, work, in, this, area, concludes, hypnosis, is, not, a, unitary, state, and, therefore, should, show, different, patterns, of, eeg, activity, depending, upon, the, task, being, experienced, in, our, evaluation, of, the, literature, enhanced, theta, is, observed, during, hypnosis, when, there, is, task, performance, or, concentrative, hypnosis, but, not, when, the, highly, hypnotizable, individuals, are, passively, relaxed, somewhat, sleepy, and, or, more, diffuse, in, their, attention, studies, have, shown, an, association, of, hypnosis, with, stronger, theta, frequency, activity, as, well, as, with, changes, to, the, gamma, frequency, activity, neuroimaging, techniques, have, been, used, to, investigate, neural, correlates, of, hypnosis, the, induction, phase, of, hypnosis, may, also, affect, the, activity, in, brain, regions, that, control, intention, and, process, conflict, anna, gosline, claims, gruzelier, and, his, colleagues, studied, brain, activity, using, an, fmri, while, subjects, completed, a, standard, cognitive, exercise, called, the, stroop, task, the, team, screened, subjects, before, the, study, and, chose, 12, that, were, highly, susceptible, to, hypnosis, and, 12, with, low, susceptibility, they, all, completed, the, task, in, the, fmri, under, normal, conditions, and, then, again, under, hypnosis, throughout, the, study, both, groups, were, consistent, in, their, task, results, achieving, similar, scores, regardless, of, their, mental, state, during, their, first, task, session, before, hypnosis, there, were, no, significant, differences, in, brain, activity, between, the, groups, but, under, hypnosis, gruzelier, found, that, the, highly, susceptible, subjects, showed, significantly, more, brain, activity, in, the, anterior, cingulate, gyrus, than, the, weakly, susceptible, subjects, this, area, of, the, brain, has, been, shown, to, respond, to, errors, and, evaluate, emotional, outcomes, the, highly, susceptible, group, also, showed, much, greater, brain, activity, on, the, left, side, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, than, the, weakly, susceptible, group, this, is, an, area, involved, with, higher, level, cognitive, processing, and, behaviour, pierre, janet, originally, developed, the, idea, of, dissociation, of, consciousness, from, his, work, with, hysterical, patients, he, believed, that, hypnosis, was, an, example, of, dissociation, whereby, areas, of, an, individual, s, behavioural, control, separate, from, ordinary, awareness, hypnosis, would, remove, some, control, from, the, conscious, mind, and, the, individual, would, respond, with, autonomic, reflexive, behaviour, weitzenhoffer, describes, hypnosis, via, this, theory, as, dissociation, of, awareness, from, the, majority, of, sensory, and, even, strictly, neural, events, taking, place, ernest, hilgard, who, developed, the, neodissociation, theory, of, hypnotism, hypothesised, that, hypnosis, causes, the, subjects, to, divide, their, consciousness, voluntarily, one, part, responds, to, the, hypnotist, while, the, other, retains, awareness, of, reality, hilgard, made, subjects, take, an, ice, water, bath, none, mentioned, the, water, being, cold, or, feeling, pain, hilgard, then, asked, the, subjects, to, lift, their, index, finger, if, they, felt, pain, and, 70, of, the, subjects, lifted, their, index, finger, this, showed, that, even, though, the, subjects, were, listening, to, the, suggestive, hypnotist, they, still, sensed, the, water, s, temperature, the, main, theorist, who, pioneered, the, influential, role, taking, theory, of, hypnotism, was, theodore, sarbin, sarbin, argued, that, hypnotic, responses, were, motivated, attempts, to, fulfill, the, socially, constructed, roles, of, hypnotic, subjects, this, has, led, to, the, misconception, that, hypnotic, subjects, are, simply, faking, however, sarbin, emphasised, the, difference, between, faking, in, which, there, is, little, subjective, identification, with, the, role, in, question, and, role, taking, in, which, the, subject, not, only, acts, externally, in, accord, with, the, role, but, also, subjectively, identifies, with, it, to, some, degree, acting, thinking, and, feeling, as, if, they, are, hypnotised, sarbin, drew, analogies, between, role, taking, in, hypnosis, and, role, taking, in, other, areas, such, as, method, acting, mental, illness, and, shamanic, possession, etc, this, interpretation, of, hypnosis, is, particularly, relevant, to, understanding, stage, hypnosis, in, which, there, is, clearly, strong, peer, pressure, to, comply, with, a, socially, constructed, role, by, performing, accordingly, on, a, theatrical, stage, hence, the, social, constructionism, and, role, taking, theory, of, hypnosis, suggests, that, individuals, are, enacting, as, opposed, to, merely, playing, a, role, and, that, really, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, hypnotic, trance, a, socially, constructed, relationship, is, built, depending, on, how, much, rapport, has, been, established, between, the, hypnotist, and, the, subject, see, hawthorne, effect, pygmalion, effect, and, placebo, effect, psychologists, such, as, robert, baker, and, graham, wagstaff, claim, that, what, we, call, hypnosis, is, actually, a, form, of, learned, social, behaviour, a, complex, hybrid, of, social, compliance, relaxation, and, suggestibility, that, can, account, for, many, esoteric, behavioural, manifestations, barber, spanos, and, chaves, 1974, proposed, a, nonstate, cognitive, behavioural, theory, of, hypnosis, similar, in, some, respects, to, sarbin, s, social, role, taking, theory, and, building, upon, the, earlier, research, of, barber, on, this, model, hypnosis, is, explained, as, an, extension, of, ordinary, psychological, processes, like, imagination, relaxation, expectation, social, compliance, etc, in, particular, barber, argued, that, responses, to, hypnotic, suggestions, were, mediated, by, a, positive, cognitive, set, consisting, of, positive, expectations, attitudes, and, motivation, daniel, araoz, subsequently, coined, the, acronym, team, to, symbolise, the, subject, s, orientation, to, hypnosis, in, terms, of, trust, expectation, attitude, and, motivation, barber, et, al, noted, that, similar, factors, appeared, to, mediate, the, response, both, to, hypnotism, and, to, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, in, particular, systematic, desensitisation, hence, research, and, clinical, practice, inspired, by, their, interpretation, has, led, to, growing, interest, in, the, relationship, between, hypnotherapy, and, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, 105, an, approach, loosely, based, on, information, theory, uses, a, brain, as, computer, model, in, adaptive, systems, feedback, increases, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, which, may, converge, towards, a, steady, state, increasing, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, enables, messages, to, be, more, clearly, received, the, hypnotist, s, object, is, to, use, techniques, to, reduce, interference, and, increase, the, receptability, of, specific, messages, suggestions, systems, theory, in, this, context, may, be, regarded, as, an, extension, of, braid, s, original, conceptualisation, of, hypnosis, as, involving, the, brain, and, nervous, system, generally, 31, systems, theory, considers, the, nervous, system, s, organisation, into, interacting, subsystems, hypnotic, phenomena, thus, involve, not, only, increased, or, decreased, activity, of, particular, subsystems, but, also, their, interaction, a, central, phenomenon, in, this, regard, is, that, of, feedback, loops, which, suggest, a, mechanism, for, creating, hypnotic, phenomena, there, is, a, huge, range, of, societies, in, england, who, train, individuals, in, hypnosis, however, one, of, the, longest, standing, organisations, is, the, british, society, of, clinical, and, academic, hypnosis, bscah, it, origins, date, back, to, 1952, when, a, group, of, dentists, set, up, the, british, society, of, dental, hypnosis, shortly, after, a, group, of, sympathetic, medical, practitioners, merged, with, this, fast, evolving, organisation, to, form, the, dental, and, medical, society, for, the, study, of, hypnosis, and, in, 1968, after, various, statutory, amendments, had, taken, place, the, british, society, of, medical, and, dental, hypnosis, bsmdh, was, formed, this, society, always, had, close, links, with, the, royal, society, of, medicine, and, many, of, its, members, were, involved, in, setting, up, a, hypnosis, section, at, this, centre, of, medical, research, in, london, and, in, 1978, under, the, presidency, of, david, waxman, the, section, of, medical, and, dental, hypnosis, was, formed, a, second, society, the, british, society, of, experimental, and, clinical, hypnosis, bsech, was, also, set, up, a, year, before, in, 1977, and, this, consisted, of, psychologists, doctors, and, dentists, with, an, interest, in, hypnosis, theory, and, practice, in, 2007, the, two, societies, merged, to, form, the, british, society, of, clinical, and, academic, hypnosis, bscah, this, society, only, trains, health, professionals, and, is, interested, in, furthering, research, into, clinical, hypnosis, the, american, society, of, clinical, hypnosis, asch, is, unique, among, organisations, for, professionals, using, hypnosis, because, members, must, be, licensed, healthcare, workers, with, graduate, degrees, as, an, interdisciplinary, organisation, asch, not, only, provides, a, classroom, to, teach, professionals, how, to, use, hypnosis, as, a, tool, in, their, practice, it, provides, professionals, with, a, community, of, experts, from, different, disciplines, the, asch, s, missions, statement, is, to, provide, and, encourage, education, programs, to, further, in, every, ethical, way, the, knowledge, understanding, and, application, of, hypnosis, in, health, care, to, encourage, research, and, scientific, publication, in, the, field, of, hypnosis, to, promote, the, further, recognition, and, acceptance, of, hypnosis, as, an, important, tool, in, clinical, health, care, and, focus, for, scientific, research, to, cooperate, with, other, professional, societies, that, share, mutual, goals, ethics, and, interests, and, to, provide, a, professional, community, for, those, clinicians, and, researchers, who, use, hypnosis, in, their, work, the, asch, also, publishes, the, american, journal, of, clinical, hypnosis
