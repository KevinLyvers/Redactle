in, linguistics, morphology, mor, fol, jee, is, the, study, of, words, including, the, principles, by, which, they, are, formed, and, how, they, relate, to, one, another, within, a, language, most, approaches, to, morphology, investigate, the, structure, of, words, in, terms, of, morphemes, which, are, the, smallest, units, in, a, language, with, some, independent, meaning, morphemes, include, roots, that, can, exist, as, words, by, themselves, but, also, categories, such, as, affixes, that, can, only, appear, as, part, of, a, larger, word, for, example, in, english, the, root, catch, and, the, suffix, ing, are, both, morphemes, catch, may, appear, as, its, own, word, or, it, may, be, combined, with, ing, to, form, the, new, word, catching, morphology, also, analyzes, how, words, behave, as, parts, of, speech, and, how, they, may, be, inflected, to, express, grammatical, categories, including, number, tense, and, aspect, concepts, such, as, productivity, are, concerned, with, how, speakers, create, words, in, specific, contexts, which, evolves, over, the, history, of, a, language, the, basic, fields, of, linguistics, broadly, focus, on, language, structure, at, different, scales, morphology, is, considered, to, operate, at, a, scale, larger, than, phonology, which, investigates, the, categories, of, speech, sounds, that, are, distinguished, within, a, spoken, language, and, thus, may, constitute, the, difference, between, a, morpheme, and, another, conversely, syntax, is, concerned, with, the, next, largest, scale, and, studies, how, words, in, turn, form, phrases, and, sentences, morphological, typology, is, a, distinct, field, that, categorises, languages, based, on, the, morphological, features, they, exhibit, the, history, of, ancient, indian, morphological, analysis, dates, back, to, the, linguist, p, ini, who, formulated, the, 3, 959, rules, of, sanskrit, morphology, in, the, text, a, dhy, y, by, using, a, constituency, grammar, the, greco, roman, grammatical, tradition, also, engaged, in, morphological, analysis, studies, in, arabic, morphology, including, the, mar, al, arw, of, a, mad, b, al, mas, d, date, back, to, at, least, 1200, ce, the, term, morphology, was, introduced, into, linguistics, by, august, schleicher, in, 1859, the, term, word, has, no, well, defined, meaning, instead, two, related, terms, are, used, in, morphology, lexeme, and, word, form, generally, a, lexeme, is, a, set, of, inflected, word, forms, that, is, often, represented, with, the, citation, form, in, small, capitals, for, instance, the, lexeme, eat, contains, the, word, forms, eat, eats, eaten, and, ate, eat, and, eats, are, thus, considered, different, word, forms, belonging, to, the, same, lexeme, eat, eat, and, eater, on, the, other, hand, are, different, lexemes, as, they, refer, to, two, different, concepts, here, are, examples, from, other, languages, of, the, failure, of, a, single, phonological, word, to, coincide, with, a, single, morphological, word, form, in, latin, one, way, to, express, the, concept, of, noun, phrase, 1, and, noun, phrase, 2, as, in, apples, and, oranges, is, to, suffix, que, to, the, second, noun, phrase, apples, oranges, and, an, extreme, level, of, the, theoretical, quandary, posed, by, some, phonological, words, is, provided, by, the, kwak, wala, language, in, kwak, wala, as, in, a, great, many, other, languages, meaning, relations, between, nouns, including, possession, and, semantic, case, are, formulated, by, affixes, instead, of, by, independent, words, the, three, word, english, phrase, with, his, club, in, which, with, identifies, its, dependent, noun, phrase, as, an, instrument, and, his, denotes, a, possession, relation, would, consist, of, two, words, or, even, one, word, in, many, languages, unlike, most, other, languages, kwak, wala, semantic, affixes, phonologically, attach, not, to, the, lexeme, they, pertain, to, semantically, but, to, the, preceding, lexeme, consider, the, following, example, in, kwak, wala, sentences, begin, with, what, corresponds, to, an, english, verb, kwix, id, i, da, clubbed, pivot, determiner, b, gwan, ma, i, a, man, accusative, determiner, q, asa, s, is, i, otter, instrumental, 3sg, possessive, t, alwagwayu, club, kwix, id, i, da, b, gwan, ma, i, a, q, asa, s, is, i, t, alwagwayu, clubbed, pivot, determiner, man, accusative, determiner, otter, instrumental, 3sg, possessive, club, the, man, clubbed, the, otter, with, his, club, that, is, to, a, speaker, of, kwak, wala, the, sentence, does, not, contain, the, words, him, the, otter, or, with, his, club, instead, the, markers, i, da, pivot, the, referring, to, man, attaches, not, to, the, noun, b, gwan, ma, man, but, to, the, verb, the, markers, a, accusative, the, referring, to, otter, attach, to, b, gwan, ma, instead, of, to, q, asa, otter, etc, in, other, words, a, speaker, of, kwak, wala, does, not, perceive, the, sentence, to, consist, of, these, phonological, words, kwix, id, clubbed, i, da, b, gwan, ma, pivot, the, man, i, a, q, asa, hit, the, otter, s, is, i, t, alwagwayu, with, his, i, club, kwix, id, i, da, b, gwan, ma, a, q, asa, s, is, i, t, alwagwayu, clubbed, pivot, the, man, i, hit, the, otter, with, his, i, club, a, central, publication, on, this, topic, is, the, volume, edited, by, dixon, and, aikhenvald, 2002, examining, the, mismatch, between, prosodic, phonological, and, grammatical, definitions, of, word, in, various, amazonian, australian, aboriginal, caucasian, eskimo, indo, european, native, north, american, west, african, and, sign, languages, apparently, a, wide, variety, of, languages, make, use, of, the, hybrid, linguistic, unit, clitic, possessing, the, grammatical, features, of, independent, words, but, the, prosodic, phonological, lack, of, freedom, of, bound, morphemes, the, intermediate, status, of, clitics, poses, a, considerable, challenge, to, linguistic, theory, given, the, notion, of, a, lexeme, it, is, possible, to, distinguish, two, kinds, of, morphological, rules, some, morphological, rules, relate, to, different, forms, of, the, same, lexeme, but, other, rules, relate, to, different, lexemes, rules, of, the, first, kind, are, inflectional, rules, but, those, of, the, second, kind, are, rules, of, word, formation, the, generation, of, the, english, plural, dogs, from, dog, is, an, inflectional, rule, and, compound, phrases, and, words, like, dog, catcher, or, dishwasher, are, examples, of, word, formation, informally, word, formation, rules, form, new, words, more, accurately, new, lexemes, and, inflection, rules, yield, variant, forms, of, the, same, word, lexeme, the, distinction, between, inflection, and, word, formation, is, not, at, all, clear, cut, there, are, many, examples, for, which, linguists, fail, to, agree, whether, a, given, rule, is, inflection, or, word, formation, the, next, section, will, attempt, to, clarify, the, distinction, word, formation, includes, a, process, in, which, one, combines, two, complete, words, but, inflection, allows, the, combination, of, a, suffix, with, a, verb, to, change, the, latter, s, form, to, that, of, the, subject, of, the, sentence, for, example, in, the, present, indefinite, go, is, used, with, subject, i, we, you, they, and, plural, nouns, but, third, person, singular, pronouns, he, she, it, and, singular, nouns, causes, goes, to, be, used, the, es, is, therefore, an, inflectional, marker, that, is, used, to, match, with, its, subject, a, further, difference, is, that, in, word, formation, the, resultant, word, may, differ, from, its, source, word, s, grammatical, category, but, in, the, process, of, inflection, the, word, never, changes, its, grammatical, category, there, is, a, further, distinction, between, two, primary, kinds, of, morphological, word, formation, derivation, and, compounding, the, latter, is, a, process, of, word, formation, that, involves, combining, complete, word, forms, into, a, single, compound, form, dog, catcher, therefore, is, a, compound, as, both, dog, and, catcher, are, complete, word, forms, in, their, own, right, but, are, subsequently, treated, as, parts, of, one, form, derivation, involves, affixing, bound, non, independent, forms, to, existing, lexemes, but, the, addition, of, the, affix, derives, a, new, lexeme, the, word, independent, for, example, is, derived, from, the, word, dependent, by, using, the, prefix, in, and, dependent, itself, is, derived, from, the, verb, depend, there, is, also, word, formation, in, the, processes, of, clipping, in, which, a, portion, of, a, word, is, removed, to, create, a, new, one, blending, in, which, two, parts, of, different, words, are, blended, into, one, acronyms, in, which, each, letter, of, the, new, word, represents, a, specific, word, in, the, representation, nato, for, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, borrowing, in, which, words, from, one, language, are, taken, and, used, in, another, and, coinage, in, which, a, new, word, is, created, to, represent, a, new, object, or, concept, a, linguistic, paradigm, is, the, complete, set, of, related, word, forms, associated, with, a, given, lexeme, the, familiar, examples, of, paradigms, are, the, conjugations, of, verbs, and, the, declensions, of, nouns, also, arranging, the, word, forms, of, a, lexeme, into, tables, by, classifying, them, according, to, shared, inflectional, categories, such, as, tense, aspect, mood, number, gender, or, case, organizes, such, for, example, the, personal, pronouns, in, english, can, be, organized, into, tables, by, using, the, categories, of, person, first, second, third, number, singular, vs, plural, gender, masculine, feminine, neuter, and, case, nominative, oblique, genitive, the, inflectional, categories, used, to, group, word, forms, into, paradigms, cannot, be, chosen, arbitrarily, but, must, be, categories, that, are, relevant, to, stating, the, syntactic, rules, of, the, language, person, and, number, are, categories, that, can, be, used, to, define, paradigms, in, english, because, the, language, has, grammatical, agreement, rules, which, require, the, verb, in, a, sentence, to, appear, in, an, inflectional, form, that, matches, the, person, and, number, of, the, subject, therefore, the, syntactic, rules, of, english, care, about, the, difference, between, dog, and, dogs, because, the, choice, between, both, forms, determines, the, form, of, the, verb, that, is, used, however, no, syntactic, rule, shows, the, difference, between, dog, and, dog, catcher, or, dependent, and, independent, the, first, two, are, nouns, and, the, other, two, are, adjectives, an, important, difference, between, inflection, and, word, formation, is, that, inflected, word, forms, of, lexemes, are, organized, into, paradigms, that, are, defined, by, the, requirements, of, syntactic, rules, and, there, are, no, corresponding, syntactic, rules, for, word, formation, the, relationship, between, syntax, and, morphology, as, well, as, how, they, interact, is, called, morphosyntax, the, term, is, also, used, to, underline, the, fact, that, syntax, and, morphology, are, interrelated, the, study, of, morphosyntax, concerns, itself, with, inflection, and, paradigms, and, some, approaches, to, morphosyntax, exclude, from, its, domain, the, phenomena, of, word, formation, compounding, and, derivation, within, morphosyntax, fall, the, study, of, agreement, and, government, above, morphological, rules, are, described, as, analogies, between, word, forms, dog, is, to, dogs, as, cat, is, to, cats, and, dish, is, to, dishes, in, this, case, the, analogy, applies, both, to, the, form, of, the, words, and, to, their, meaning, in, each, pair, the, first, word, means, one, of, x, and, the, second, two, or, more, of, x, and, the, difference, is, always, the, plural, form, s, or, es, affixed, to, the, second, word, which, signals, the, key, distinction, between, singular, and, plural, entities, one, of, the, largest, sources, of, complexity, in, morphology, is, that, the, one, to, one, correspondence, between, meaning, and, form, scarcely, applies, to, every, case, in, the, language, in, english, there, are, word, form, pairs, like, ox, oxen, goose, geese, and, sheep, sheep, whose, difference, between, the, singular, and, the, plural, is, signaled, in, a, way, that, departs, from, the, regular, pattern, or, is, not, signaled, at, all, even, cases, regarded, as, regular, such, as, s, are, not, so, simple, the, s, in, dogs, is, not, pronounced, the, same, way, as, the, s, in, cats, and, in, plurals, such, as, dishes, a, vowel, is, added, before, the, s, those, cases, in, which, the, same, distinction, is, effected, by, alternative, forms, of, a, word, constitute, allomorphy, phonological, rules, constrain, the, sounds, that, can, appear, next, to, each, other, in, a, language, and, morphological, rules, when, applied, blindly, would, often, violate, phonological, rules, by, resulting, in, sound, sequences, that, are, prohibited, in, the, language, in, question, for, example, to, form, the, plural, of, dish, by, simply, appending, an, s, to, the, end, of, the, word, would, result, in, the, form, which, is, not, permitted, by, the, phonotactics, of, english, to, rescue, the, word, a, vowel, sound, is, inserted, between, the, root, and, the, plural, marker, and, results, similar, rules, apply, to, the, pronunciation, of, the, s, in, dogs, and, cats, it, depends, on, the, quality, voiced, vs, unvoiced, of, the, final, preceding, phoneme, lexical, morphology, is, the, branch, of, morphology, that, deals, with, the, lexicon, that, morphologically, conceived, is, the, collection, of, lexemes, in, a, language, as, such, it, concerns, itself, primarily, with, word, formation, derivation, and, compounding, there, are, three, principal, approaches, to, morphology, and, each, tries, to, capture, the, distinctions, above, in, different, ways, while, the, associations, indicated, between, the, concepts, in, each, item, in, that, list, are, very, strong, they, are, not, absolute, in, morpheme, based, morphology, word, forms, are, analyzed, as, arrangements, of, morphemes, a, morpheme, is, defined, as, the, minimal, meaningful, unit, of, a, language, in, a, word, such, as, independently, the, morphemes, are, said, to, be, in, de, pend, ent, and, ly, pend, is, the, bound, root, and, the, other, morphemes, are, in, this, case, derivational, affixes, in, words, such, as, dogs, dog, is, the, root, and, the, s, is, an, inflectional, morpheme, in, its, simplest, and, most, na, ve, form, this, way, of, analyzing, word, forms, called, item, and, arrangement, treats, words, as, if, they, were, made, of, morphemes, put, after, each, other, concatenated, like, beads, on, a, string, more, recent, and, sophisticated, approaches, such, as, distributed, morphology, seek, to, maintain, the, idea, of, the, morpheme, while, accommodating, non, concatenated, analogical, and, other, processes, that, have, proven, problematic, for, item, and, arrangement, theories, and, similar, approaches, morpheme, based, morphology, presumes, three, basic, axioms, morpheme, based, morphology, comes, in, two, flavours, one, bloomfieldian, and, one, hockettian, for, bloomfield, the, morpheme, was, the, minimal, form, with, meaning, but, did, not, have, meaning, itself, for, hockett, morphemes, are, meaning, elements, not, form, elements, for, him, there, is, a, morpheme, plural, using, allomorphs, such, as, s, en, and, ren, within, much, morpheme, based, morphological, theory, the, two, views, are, mixed, in, unsystematic, ways, so, a, writer, may, refer, to, the, morpheme, plural, and, the, morpheme, s, in, the, same, sentence, lexeme, based, morphology, usually, takes, what, is, called, an, item, and, process, approach, instead, of, analyzing, a, word, form, as, a, set, of, morphemes, arranged, in, sequence, a, word, form, is, said, to, be, the, result, of, applying, rules, that, alter, a, word, form, or, stem, in, order, to, produce, a, new, one, an, inflectional, rule, takes, a, stem, changes, it, as, is, required, by, the, rule, and, outputs, a, word, form, a, derivational, rule, takes, a, stem, changes, it, as, per, its, own, requirements, and, outputs, a, derived, stem, a, compounding, rule, takes, word, forms, and, similarly, outputs, a, compound, stem, word, based, morphology, is, usually, a, word, and, paradigm, approach, the, theory, takes, paradigms, as, a, central, notion, instead, of, stating, rules, to, combine, morphemes, into, word, forms, or, to, generate, word, forms, from, stems, word, based, morphology, states, generalizations, that, hold, between, the, forms, of, inflectional, paradigms, the, major, point, behind, this, approach, is, that, many, such, generalizations, are, hard, to, state, with, either, of, the, other, approaches, word, and, paradigm, approaches, are, also, well, suited, to, capturing, purely, morphological, phenomena, such, as, morphomes, examples, to, show, the, effectiveness, of, word, based, approaches, are, usually, drawn, from, fusional, languages, where, a, given, piece, of, a, word, which, a, morpheme, based, theory, would, call, an, inflectional, morpheme, corresponds, to, a, combination, of, grammatical, categories, for, example, third, person, plural, morpheme, based, theories, usually, have, no, problems, with, this, situation, since, one, says, that, a, given, morpheme, has, two, categories, item, and, process, theories, on, the, other, hand, often, break, down, in, cases, like, these, because, they, all, too, often, assume, that, there, will, be, two, separate, rules, here, one, for, third, person, and, the, other, for, plural, but, the, distinction, between, them, turns, out, to, be, artificial, the, approaches, treat, these, as, whole, words, that, are, related, to, each, other, by, analogical, rules, words, can, be, categorized, based, on, the, pattern, they, fit, into, this, applies, both, to, existing, words, and, to, new, ones, application, of, a, pattern, different, from, the, one, that, has, been, used, historically, can, give, rise, to, a, new, word, such, as, older, replacing, elder, where, older, follows, the, normal, pattern, of, adjectival, comparatives, and, cows, replacing, kine, where, cows, fits, the, regular, pattern, of, plural, formation, in, the, 19th, century, philologists, devised, a, now, classic, classification, of, languages, according, to, their, morphology, some, languages, are, isolating, and, have, little, to, no, morphology, others, are, agglutinative, whose, words, tend, to, have, many, easily, separable, morphemes, such, as, turkic, languages, others, yet, are, inflectional, or, fusional, because, their, inflectional, morphemes, are, fused, together, like, some, indo, european, languages, such, as, pashto, and, russian, that, leads, to, one, bound, morpheme, conveying, multiple, pieces, of, information, a, standard, example, of, an, isolating, language, is, chinese, an, agglutinative, language, is, turkish, and, practically, all, turkic, languages, latin, and, greek, are, prototypical, inflectional, or, fusional, languages, it, is, clear, that, this, classification, is, not, at, all, clearcut, and, many, languages, latin, and, greek, among, them, do, not, neatly, fit, any, one, of, these, types, and, some, fit, in, more, than, one, way, a, continuum, of, complex, morphology, of, language, may, be, adopted, the, three, models, of, morphology, stem, from, attempts, to, analyze, languages, that, more, or, less, match, different, categories, in, this, typology, the, item, and, arrangement, approach, fits, very, naturally, with, agglutinative, languages, the, item, and, process, and, word, and, paradigm, approaches, usually, address, fusional, languages, as, there, is, very, little, fusion, involved, in, word, formation, classical, typology, mostly, applies, to, inflectional, morphology, depending, on, the, preferred, way, of, expressing, non, inflectional, notions, languages, may, be, classified, as, synthetic, using, word, formation, or, analytic, using, syntactic, phrases, pingelapese, is, a, micronesian, language, spoken, on, the, pingelap, atoll, and, on, two, of, the, eastern, caroline, islands, called, the, high, island, of, pohnpei, similar, to, other, languages, words, in, pingelapese, can, take, different, forms, to, add, to, or, even, change, its, meaning, verbal, suffixes, are, morphemes, added, at, the, end, of, a, word, to, change, its, form, prefixes, are, those, that, are, added, at, the, front, for, example, the, pingelapese, suffix, kin, means, with, or, at, it, is, added, at, the, end, of, a, verb, sa, is, an, example, of, a, verbal, prefix, it, is, added, to, the, beginning, of, a, word, and, means, not, there, are, also, directional, suffixes, that, when, added, to, the, root, word, give, the, listener, a, better, idea, of, where, the, subject, is, headed, the, verb, alu, means, to, walk, a, directional, suffix, can, be, used, to, give, more, detail, directional, suffixes, are, not, limited, to, motion, verbs, when, added, to, non, motion, verbs, their, meanings, are, a, figurative, one, the, following, table, gives, some, examples, of, directional, suffixes, and, their, possible, meanings
