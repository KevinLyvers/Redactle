self, determination, refers, to, a, people, s, right, to, form, its, own, political, entity, and, internal, self, determination, is, the, right, to, representative, government, with, full, suffrage, self, determination, is, a, cardinal, principle, in, modern, international, law, binding, as, such, on, the, united, nations, as, an, authoritative, interpretation, of, the, charter, s, norms, the, principle, does, not, state, how, the, decision, is, to, be, made, nor, what, the, outcome, should, be, whether, independence, federation, protection, some, form, of, autonomy, or, full, assimilation, however, and, the, right, of, self, determination, does, not, necessarily, include, a, right, to, an, independent, state, for, every, ethnic, group, within, a, former, colonial, territory, further, no, right, to, secession, is, recognized, under, international, law, the, concept, emerged, with, the, rise, of, nationalism, in, the, 19th, century, and, came, into, prominent, use, in, the, 1860s, spreading, rapidly, thereafter, during, and, after, world, war, i, the, principle, was, encouraged, by, both, soviet, premier, vladimir, lenin, and, united, states, president, woodrow, wilson, having, announced, his, fourteen, points, on, 8, january, 1918, on, 11, february, 1918, wilson, stated, national, aspirations, must, be, respected, people, may, now, be, dominated, and, governed, only, by, their, own, consent, self, determination, is, not, a, mere, phrase, it, is, an, imperative, principle, of, action, during, world, war, ii, the, principle, was, included, in, the, atlantic, charter, jointly, declared, on, 14, august, 1941, by, franklin, d, roosevelt, president, of, the, united, states, and, winston, churchill, prime, minister, of, the, united, kingdom, who, pledged, the, eight, principal, points, of, the, charter, it, was, recognized, as, an, international, legal, right, after, it, was, explicitly, listed, as, a, right, in, the, un, charter, implementing, the, right, to, self, determination, can, be, politically, difficult, in, part, because, there, are, multiple, interpretations, of, what, constitutes, a, people, and, which, groups, may, legitimately, claim, the, right, to, self, determination, as, world, court, judge, ivor, jennings, put, it, the, people, cannot, decide, until, somebody, decides, who, are, the, people, the, norm, of, self, determination, can, be, originally, traced, to, the, american, and, french, revolutions, and, the, emergence, of, nationalism, the, european, revolutions, of, 1848, the, post, world, war, i, settlement, at, versailles, and, the, decolonization, movement, after, world, war, ii, shaped, and, established, the, norm, in, international, law, the, american, revolution, has, been, seen, as, the, earliest, assertion, of, the, right, of, national, and, democratic, self, determination, as, well, as, the, concepts, of, consent, and, sovereignty, by, the, people, governed, these, ideas, were, inspired, particularly, by, john, locke, s, writings, of, the, previous, century, thomas, jefferson, further, promoted, the, notion, that, the, will, of, the, people, was, supreme, especially, through, authorship, of, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, which, became, an, inspiration, for, european, nationalist, movements, during, the, 19th, century, the, french, revolution, legitimatized, the, ideas, of, self, determination, on, that, old, world, continent, nationalist, sentiments, emerged, inside, traditional, empires, pan, slavism, in, russia, ottomanism, kemalist, ideology, and, arab, nationalism, in, the, ottoman, empire, state, shintoism, and, japanese, identity, in, japan, and, han, identity, in, juxtaposition, to, the, manchurian, ruling, class, in, china, meanwhile, in, europe, itself, the, rise, of, nationalism, led, to, greece, hungary, poland, and, bulgaria, all, seeking, or, winning, independence, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, supported, some, of, these, nationalist, movements, believing, nationalism, might, be, a, prior, condition, to, social, reform, and, international, alliances, in, 1914, vladimir, lenin, wrote, would, be, wrong, to, interpret, the, right, to, self, determination, as, meaning, anything, but, the, right, to, existence, as, a, separate, state, woodrow, wilson, revived, america, s, commitment, to, self, determination, at, least, for, european, states, during, world, war, i, when, the, bolsheviks, came, to, power, in, russia, in, the, october, revolution, they, called, for, russia, s, immediate, withdrawal, as, a, member, of, the, allies, of, world, war, i, they, also, supported, the, right, of, all, nations, including, colonies, to, self, determination, the, 1918, constitution, of, the, soviet, union, acknowledged, the, right, of, secession, for, its, constituent, republics, this, presented, a, challenge, to, wilson, s, more, limited, demands, in, january, 1918, wilson, issued, his, fourteen, points, of, january, 1918, which, among, other, things, called, for, adjustment, of, colonial, claims, insofar, as, the, interests, of, colonial, powers, had, equal, weight, with, the, claims, of, subject, peoples, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, in, march, 1918, led, to, soviet, russia, s, exit, from, the, war, and, the, nominal, independence, of, armenia, finland, estonia, latvia, ukraine, lithuania, georgia, and, poland, though, in, fact, those, territories, were, under, german, control, the, end, of, the, war, led, to, the, dissolution, of, the, defeated, austro, hungarian, empire, and, czechoslovakia, and, the, union, of, the, state, of, slovenes, croats, and, serbs, and, the, kingdom, of, serbia, as, new, states, out, of, the, wreckage, of, the, habsburg, empire, however, this, imposition, of, states, where, some, nationalities, especially, poles, czechs, and, serbs, and, romanians, were, given, power, over, nationalities, who, disliked, and, distrusted, them, was, eventually, used, as, a, pretext, for, german, aggression, in, world, war, ii, wilson, publicly, argued, that, the, agreements, made, in, the, aftermath, of, the, war, would, be, a, readjustment, of, those, great, injustices, which, underlie, the, whole, structure, of, european, and, asiatic, society, which, he, attributed, to, the, absence, of, democratic, rule, the, new, order, emerging, in, the, postwar, period, would, according, to, wilson, place, governments, in, the, hands, of, the, people, and, taken, out, of, the, hands, of, coteries, and, of, sovereigns, who, had, no, right, to, rule, over, the, people, the, league, of, nations, was, established, as, the, symbol, of, the, emerging, postwar, order, one, of, its, earliest, tasks, was, to, legitimize, the, territorial, boundaries, of, the, new, nation, states, created, in, the, territories, of, the, former, ottoman, empire, asia, and, africa, the, principle, of, self, determination, did, not, extend, so, far, as, to, end, colonialism, under, the, reasoning, that, the, local, populations, were, not, civilized, enough, the, league, of, nations, was, to, assign, each, of, the, post, ottoman, asian, and, african, states, and, colonies, to, a, european, power, by, the, grant, of, a, league, of, nations, mandate, one, of, the, german, objections, to, the, treaty, of, versailles, was, a, somewhat, selective, application, of, the, principle, of, self, determination, as, the, republic, of, german, austria, which, included, the, sudetenland, was, seen, as, representing, the, will, to, join, germany, in, those, regions, while, the, majority, of, people, in, danzig, wanted, to, remain, within, the, reich, however, the, allies, ignored, the, german, objections, wilson, s, 14, points, had, called, for, polish, independence, to, be, restored, and, poland, to, have, secure, access, to, the, sea, which, would, imply, that, the, german, city, of, danzig, modern, gda, sk, poland, which, occupied, a, strategic, location, where, the, vistula, river, flowed, into, the, baltic, sea, be, ceded, to, poland, at, the, paris, peace, conference, in, 1919, the, polish, delegation, led, by, roman, dmowski, asked, for, wilson, to, honor, point, 14, of, the, 14, points, by, transferring, danzig, to, poland, arguing, that, the, city, was, rightfully, part, of, poland, because, it, was, polish, until, 1793, and, that, poland, would, not, be, economically, viable, without, it, during, the, first, partition, of, poland, in, 1772, the, inhabitants, of, danzig, fought, fiercely, for, it, to, remain, a, part, of, poland, but, as, a, result, of, the, germanisation, process, in, the, 19th, century, 90, of, the, people, in, danzig, were, german, by, 1919, which, made, the, allied, leaders, at, the, paris, peace, conference, compromise, by, creating, the, free, city, of, danzig, a, city, state, in, which, poland, had, certain, special, rights, through, the, city, of, danzig, was, 90, german, and, 10, polish, the, surrounding, countryside, around, danzig, was, overwhelmingly, polish, and, the, ethnically, polish, rural, areas, included, in, the, free, city, of, danzig, objected, arguing, that, they, wanted, to, be, part, of, poland, neither, the, poles, nor, the, germans, were, happy, with, this, compromise, and, the, danzig, issue, became, a, flash, point, of, german, polish, tension, throughout, the, interwar, period, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, there, were, some, successful, movements, for, self, determination, in, the, beginnings, of, the, process, of, decolonization, in, the, statute, of, westminster, the, united, kingdom, granted, independence, to, canada, new, zealand, newfoundland, the, commonwealth, of, australia, and, the, union, of, south, africa, after, the, british, parliament, declared, itself, as, incapable, of, passing, laws, over, them, without, their, consent, although, the, irish, free, state, had, already, gained, internationally, recognized, independence, at, the, conclusion, of, the, irish, war, of, independence, as, established, in, the, anglo, irish, treaty, it, was, still, included, in, the, statute, of, westminster, this, statute, built, on, the, balfour, declaration, of, 1926, which, recognized, the, autonomy, of, these, british, dominions, representing, the, first, phase, of, the, creation, of, the, british, commonwealth, of, nations, egypt, afghanistan, and, iraq, also, achieved, independence, from, britain, other, efforts, were, unsuccessful, like, the, indian, independence, movement, and, italy, japan, and, germany, all, initiated, new, efforts, to, bring, certain, territories, under, their, control, leading, to, world, war, ii, in, particular, the, national, socialist, program, invoked, this, right, of, nations, in, its, first, point, out, of, 25, as, it, was, publicly, proclaimed, on, 24, february, 1920, by, adolf, hitler, in, asia, japan, became, a, rising, power, and, gained, more, respect, from, western, powers, after, its, victory, in, the, russo, japanese, war, japan, joined, the, allied, powers, in, world, war, i, and, attacked, german, colonial, possessions, in, the, far, east, adding, former, german, possessions, to, its, own, empire, in, the, 1930s, japan, gained, significant, influence, in, inner, mongolia, and, manchuria, after, it, invaded, manchuria, it, established, manchukuo, a, puppet, state, in, manchuria, and, eastern, inner, mongolia, this, was, essentially, the, model, japan, followed, as, it, invaded, other, areas, in, asia, and, established, the, greater, east, asia, co, prosperity, sphere, japan, went, to, considerable, trouble, to, argue, that, manchukuo, was, justified, by, the, principle, of, self, determination, claiming, that, people, of, manchuria, wanted, to, break, away, from, china, and, asked, the, kwantung, army, to, intervene, on, their, behalf, however, the, lytton, commission, which, had, been, appointed, by, the, league, of, nations, to, decide, if, japan, had, committed, aggression, or, not, stated, the, majority, of, people, in, manchuria, who, were, han, chinese, who, did, not, wish, to, leave, china, in, 1912, the, republic, of, china, officially, succeeded, the, qing, dynasty, while, outer, mongolia, tibet, and, tuva, proclaimed, their, independence, independence, was, not, accepted, by, the, government, of, china, by, the, treaty, of, kyakhta, 1915, outer, mongolia, recognized, china, s, sovereignty, however, the, soviet, threat, of, seizing, parts, of, inner, mongolia, induced, china, to, recognize, outer, mongolia, s, independence, provided, that, a, referendum, was, held, the, referendum, took, place, on, october, 20, 1945, with, according, to, official, numbers, 100, of, the, electorate, voting, for, independence, many, of, east, asia, s, current, disputes, to, sovereignty, and, self, determination, stem, from, unresolved, disputes, from, world, war, ii, after, its, fall, the, empire, of, japan, renounced, control, over, many, of, its, former, possessions, including, korea, sakhalin, island, and, taiwan, in, none, of, these, areas, were, the, opinions, of, affected, people, consulted, or, given, significant, priority, korea, was, specifically, granted, independence, but, the, receiver, of, various, other, areas, was, not, stated, in, the, treaty, of, san, francisco, giving, taiwan, de, facto, independence, although, its, political, status, continues, to, be, ambiguous, in, 1941, allies, of, world, war, ii, declared, the, atlantic, charter, and, accepted, the, principle, of, self, determination, in, january, 1942, twenty, six, states, signed, the, declaration, by, united, nations, which, accepted, those, principles, the, ratification, of, the, united, nations, charter, in, 1945, at, the, end, of, world, war, ii, placed, the, right, of, self, determination, into, the, framework, of, international, law, and, diplomacy, on, 14, december, 1960, the, united, nations, general, assembly, adopted, united, nations, general, assembly, resolution, 1514, xv, subtitled, declaration, on, the, granting, of, independence, to, colonial, countries, and, peoples, which, supported, the, granting, of, independence, to, colonial, countries, and, people, by, providing, an, inevitable, legal, linkage, between, self, determination, and, its, goal, of, decolonisation, it, postulated, a, new, international, law, based, right, of, freedom, to, exercise, economic, self, determination, article, 5, states, immediate, steps, shall, be, taken, in, trust, and, non, self, governing, territories, or, all, other, territories, which, have, not, yet, attained, independence, to, transfer, all, powers, to, the, people, of, those, territories, without, any, conditions, or, reservations, in, accordance, with, their, freely, expressed, will, and, desire, without, any, distinction, as, to, race, creed, or, colour, in, order, to, enable, them, to, enjoy, complete, independence, and, freedom, on, 15, december, 1960, the, united, nations, general, assembly, adopted, united, nations, general, assembly, resolution, 1541, xv, subtitled, principles, which, should, guide, members, in, determining, whether, or, nor, an, obligation, exists, to, transmit, the, information, called, for, under, article, 73e, of, the, united, nations, charter, in, article, 3, which, provided, that, he, inadequacy, of, political, economic, social, and, educational, preparedness, should, never, serve, as, a, pretext, for, delaying, the, right, to, self, determination, and, independence, to, monitor, the, implementation, of, resolution, 1514, in, 1961, the, general, assembly, created, the, special, committee, referred, to, popularly, as, the, special, committee, on, decolonization, to, ensure, decolonization, complete, compliance, with, the, principles, of, self, determination, in, general, assembly, resolution, 1541, xv, however, the, charter, and, other, resolutions, did, not, insist, on, full, independence, as, the, best, way, of, obtaining, self, government, nor, did, they, include, an, enforcement, mechanism, moreover, new, states, were, recognized, by, the, legal, doctrine, of, uti, possidetis, juris, meaning, that, old, administrative, boundaries, would, become, international, boundaries, upon, independence, if, they, had, little, relevance, to, linguistic, ethnic, and, cultural, boundaries, nevertheless, justified, by, the, language, of, self, determination, between, 1946, and, 1960, thirty, seven, new, nations, in, asia, africa, and, the, middle, east, gained, independence, from, colonial, powers, the, territoriality, issue, inevitably, would, lead, to, more, conflicts, and, independence, movements, within, many, states, and, challenges, to, the, assumption, that, territorial, integrity, is, as, important, as, self, determination, decolonization, in, the, world, was, contrasted, by, the, soviet, union, s, successful, post, war, expansionism, tuva, and, several, regional, states, in, eastern, europe, the, baltic, and, central, asia, had, been, fully, annexed, by, the, soviet, union, during, world, war, ii, now, it, extended, its, influence, by, establishing, the, satellite, states, of, eastern, germany, and, the, countries, of, eastern, europe, along, with, support, for, revolutionary, movements, in, china, and, north, korea, although, satellite, states, were, independent, and, possessed, sovereignty, the, soviet, union, violated, principles, of, self, determination, by, suppressing, the, hungarian, revolution, of, 1956, and, the, prague, spring, czechoslovak, reforms, of, 1968, it, invaded, afghanistan, to, support, a, communist, government, assailed, by, local, tribal, groups, however, marxism, leninism, and, its, theory, of, imperialism, were, also, strong, influences, in, the, national, emancipation, movements, of, third, world, nations, rebelling, against, colonial, or, puppet, regimes, in, many, third, world, countries, communism, became, an, ideology, that, united, groups, to, oppose, imperialism, or, colonization, soviet, actions, were, contained, by, the, united, states, which, saw, communism, as, a, menace, to, its, interests, throughout, the, cold, war, the, united, states, created, supported, and, sponsored, regimes, with, various, success, that, served, their, economic, and, political, interests, among, them, anti, communist, regimes, such, as, that, of, augusto, pinochet, in, chile, and, suharto, in, indonesia, to, achieve, this, a, variety, of, means, was, implemented, including, the, orchestration, of, coups, sponsoring, of, anti, communist, countries, and, military, interventions, consequently, many, self, determination, movements, which, spurned, some, type, of, anti, communist, government, were, accused, of, being, soviet, inspired, or, controlled, in, asia, the, soviet, union, had, already, converted, mongolia, into, a, satellite, state, but, abandoned, propping, up, the, second, east, turkestan, republic, and, gave, up, its, manchurian, claims, to, china, the, new, people, s, republic, of, china, had, gained, control, of,

to, spread, their, influence, in, 1947, india, gained, independence, from, the, british, empire, the, empire, was, in, decline, but, adapted, to, these, circumstances, by, creating, the, british, commonwealth, since, 1949, the, commonwealth, of, nations, which, is, a, free, association, of, equal, states, as, india, obtained, its, independence, multiple, ethnic, conflicts, emerged, in, relation, to, the, formation, of, a, statehood, during, the, partition, of, india, which, resulted, in, islamic, pakistan, and, secular, india, before, the, advent, of, the, british, no, empire,

from, the, dutch, empire, in, 1949, after, the, latter, failed, to, restore, colonial, control, as, mentioned, above, indonesia, also, wanted, a, powerful, position, in, the, region, that, could, be, lessened, by, the, creation, of, united, malaysia, the, netherlands, retained, its, new, guinea, part, from, the, previous, dutch, east, indies, but, indonesia, threatened, to, invade, and, annex, it, a, vote, was, supposedly, taken, under, the, un, sponsored, act, of, free, choice, to, allow, west, new, guineans, to, decide, their, fate, although, many, dispute, its, veracity, later, portugal, relinquished, control, over, east, timor, in, the, aftermath, of, carnation, revolution, in, 1975, at, which, time, indonesia, promptly, invaded, and, annexed, it, in, 1999, indonesian, president, b,

peacefully, kosovo, which, was, previously, an, autonomous, unit, of, serbia, declared, independence, in, 2008, but, has, received, less, international, recognition, in, december, 1991, gorbachev, resigned, as, president, and, the, soviet, union, dissolved, relatively, peacefully, into, fifteen, sovereign, republics, all, of, which, rejected, communism, and, most, of, which, adopted, democratic, reforms, and, free, market, economies, inside, those, new, republics, four, major, areas, have, claimed, their, own, independence, but, not, received, widespread, international, recognition, after, decades, of, civil, war, indonesia, finally, recognized, the, independence, of, east, timor, in, 2002, in, 1949, the, communist, party, won, the, chinese, civil, war, and,

several, outlying, islands, since, then, the, people, s, republic, of, china, has, been, involved, in, disputes, with, the, roc, over, issues, of, sovereignty, and, the, political, status, of, taiwan, as, noted, self, determination, movements, remain, strong, in, some, areas, of, the, world, some, areas, possess, de, facto, independence, such, as, taiwan, north, cyprus, kosovo, and, south, ossetia, but, their, independence, is, disputed, by, one, or, more, major, states, significant, movements, for, self, determination, also, persist, for, locations, that, lack, de, facto, independence, such, as, east, turkistan, xinjiang, kurdistan, balochistan, chechnya, and, palestine, since, the, early, 1990s, the, legitimatization, of, the, principle, of, national, self, determination, has, led, to, an, increase, in, the, number, of, conflicts, within, states, as, sub, groups, seek, greater, self, determination, and, full, secession, and, as, their, conflicts, for, leadership, within, groups, and, with, other, groups, and, with, the, dominant, state, become, violent, the, international, reaction, to, these, new, movements, has, been, uneven, and, often, dictated, more, by, politics, than, principle, the, 2000, united, nations, millennium, declaration, failed, to, deal, with, these, new, demands, mentioning, only, the, right, to, self, determination, of, peoples, which, remain, under, colonial, domination, and, foreign, occupation, in, an, issue, of, macquarie, university, law, journal, associate, professor, aleksandar, pavkovic, and, senior, lecturer, peter, radan, outlined, current, legal, and, political, issues, in, self, determination, there, is, not, a, recognized, legal, definition, of, peoples, in, international, law, indeed, ivor, jennings, called, wilson, s, doctrine, ridiculous, because, though, on, the, surface, it, seems, reasonable, to, let, the, people, decide, in, practice, the, people, cannot, decide, until, someone, decides, who, are, the, people, reviewing, various, international, judgements, and, un, resolutions, vita, gudeleviciute, of, vytautas, magnus, university, law, school, finds, that, in, cases, of, non, self, governing, peoples, colonized, and, or, indigenous, and, foreign, military, occupation, a, people, is, defined, as, the, entire, population, of, the, occupied, territorial, unit, no, matter, their, other, differences, meanwhile, in, cases, where, people, lack, representation, by, a, state, s, government, the, unrepresented, become, a, defined, as, a, separate, people, present, international, law, does, not, recognize, ethnic, and, other, minorities, as, separate, peoples, with, the, notable, exception, of, cases, in, which, such, groups, are, systematically, disenfranchised, by, the, government, of, the, state, they, live, in, other, definitions, offered, are, peoples, as, self, evident, from, ethnicity, language, history, etc, or, defined, by, ties, of, mutual, affection, or, sentiment, loyalty, or, by, mutual, obligations, among, peoples, professor, uriel, abulof, suggests, that, self, determination, entails, the, moral, double, helix, of, duality, 1, personal, right, to, align, with, a, people, and, the, people, s, right, to, determine, their, politics, and, 2, and, mutuality, the, right, is, as, much, the, other, s, as, the, self, s, thus, self, determination, grants, individuals, the, right, to, form, a, people, which, then, has, the, right, to, establish, an, independent, state, as, long, as, they, grant, the, same, to, all, other, individuals, and, peoples, national, self, determination, appears, to, challenge, the, principle, of, territorial, integrity, or, sovereignty, of, states, as, it, is, the, will, of, the, people, that, makes, a, state, legitimate, this, implies, a, people, should, be, free, to, choose, their, own, state, and, its, territorial, boundaries, however, there, are, far, more, self, identified, nations, than, there, are, existing, states, and, there, is, no, legal, process, to, redraw, state, boundaries, according, to, the, will, of, these, peoples, according, to, the, helsinki, final, act, of, 1975, the, un, icj, and, international, law, experts, there, is, no, contradiction, between, the, principles, of, self, determination, and, territorial, integrity, with, the, latter, taking, precedence, allen, buchanan, author, of, seven, books, on, self, determination, and, secession, supports, territorial, integrity, as, a, moral, and, legal, aspect, of, constitutional, democracy, however, he, also, advances, a, remedial, rights, only, theory, where, a, group, has, a, general, right, to, secede, if, and, only, if, it, has, suffered, certain, injustices, for, which, secession, is, the, appropriate, remedy, of, last, resort, he, also, would, recognize, secession, if, the, state, grants, or, the, constitution, includes, a, right, to, secede, vita, gudeleviciute, holds, that, in, cases, of, non, self, governing, peoples, and, foreign, military, occupation, the, principle, of, self, determination, trumps, that, of, territorial, integrity, in, cases, where, people, lack, representation, by, a, state, s, government, they, also, may, be, considered, a, separate, people, but, under, current, law, cannot, claim, the, right, to, self, determination, on, the, other, hand, she, finds, that, secession, within, a, single, state, is, a, domestic, matter, not, covered, by, international, law, thus, there, are, no, on, what, groups, may, constitute, a, seceding, people, a, number, of, states, have, laid, claim, to, territories, which, they, allege, were, removed, from, them, as, a, result, of, colonialism, this, is, justified, by, reference, to, paragraph, 6, of, un, resolution, 1514, xv, which, states, that, any, attempt, aimed, at, partial, or, total, disruption, of, the, national, unity, and, the, territorial, integrity, of, a, country, is, incompatible, with, the, purposes, and, principles, of, the, charter, this, it, is, claimed, applies, to, situations, where, the, territorial, integrity, of, a, state, had, been, disrupted, by, colonisation, so, that, the, people, of, a, territory, subject, to, a, historic, territorial, claim, are, prevented, from, exercising, a, right, to, self, determination, this, interpretation, is, rejected, by, many, states, who, argue, that, paragraph, 2, of, un, resolution, 1514, xv, states, that, all, peoples, have, the, right, to, self, determination, and, paragraph, 6, cannot, be, used, to, justify, territorial, claims, the, original, purpose, of, paragraph, 6, was, to, ensure, that, acts, of, self, determination, occur, within, the, established, boundaries, of, colonies, rather, than, within, sub, regions, further, the, use, of, the, word, attempt, in, paragraph, 6, denotes, future, action, and, cannot, be, construed, to, justify, territorial, redress, for, past, action, an, attempt, sponsored, by, spain, and, argentina, to, qualify, the, right, to, self, determination, in, cases, where, there, was, a, territorial, dispute, was, rejected, by, the, un, general, assembly, which, re, iterated, the, right, to, self, determination, was, a, universal, right, in, order, to, accommodate, demands, for, minority, rights, and, avoid, secession, and, the, creation, of, a, separate, new, state, many, states, decentralize, or, devolve, greater, decision, making, power, to, new, or, existing, subunits, or, autonomous, areas, self, determination, can, be, at, odds, with, the, principle, of, majority, rule, and, equal, rights, especially, when, there, is, a, sizable, minority, group, in, democratic, societies, majority, rule, is, often, used, to, determine, the, outcome, in, electoral, and, voting, processes, however, a, major, critique, of, majority, rule, is, that, it, may, result, in, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, especially, in, cases, in, which, a, simple, majority, is, used, in, order, to, determine, outcome, this, flaw, is, particularly, poignant, when, there, is, a, large, minority, group, whose, interests, are, not, being, represented, and, who, may, then, seek, to, secede, the, right, to, self, determination, by, a, minority, has, long, been, contested, in, democracies, with, majority, rule, for, instance, in, his, first, inaugural, speech, abraham, lincoln, argued, that, plainly, the, central, idea, of, secession, is, the, essence, of, anarchy, a, majority, held, in, restraint, by, constitutional, checks, and, limitations, and, always, changing, easily, with, deliberate, changes, of, popular, opinions, and, sentiments, is, the, only, true, sovereign, of, a, free, people, whoever, rejects, it, does, of, necessity, fly, to, anarchy, or, to, despotism, unanimity, is, impossible, the, rule, of, a, minority, as, a, permanent, arrangement, is, wholly, inadmissible, so, that, rejecting, the, majority, principle, anarchy, or, despotism, in, some, form, is, all, that, is, left, however, liberal, proponents, for, the, right, to, self, determination, by, minority, groups, contradict, this, notion, by, arguing, that, in, cases, where, the, minority, is, not, able, to, become, the, majority, and, that, minority, is, territorially, concentrated, and, does, not, want, to, be, governed, by, the, majority, it, may, serve, the, best, interest, of, the, state, to, allow, the, secession, of, this, group, most, sovereign, states, do, not, recognize, the, right, to, self, determination, through, secession, in, their, constitutions, many, expressly, forbid, it, however, there, are, several, existing, models, of, self, determination, through, greater, autonomy, and, through, secession, in, liberal, constitutional, democracies, the, principle, of, majority, rule, has, dictated, whether, a, minority, can, secede, in, the, united, states, abraham, lincoln, acknowledged, that, secession, might, be, possible, through, amending, the, united, states, constitution, the, supreme, court, in, texas, v, white, held, secession, could, occur, through, revolution, or, through, consent, of, the, states, the, british, parliament, in, 1933, held, that, western, australia, only, could, secede, from, australia, upon, vote, of, a, majority, of, the, country, as, a, whole, the, previous, two, thirds, majority, vote, for, secession, via, referendum, in, western, australia, was, insufficient, the, chinese, communist, party, followed, the, soviet, union, in, including, the, right, of, secession, in, its, 1931, constitution, in, order, to, entice, ethnic, nationalities, and, tibet, into, joining, however, the, party, eliminated, the, right, to, secession, in, later, years, and, had, anti, secession, clause, written, into, the, constitution, before, and, after, the, founding, the, people, s, republic, of, china, the, 1947, constitution, of, the, union, of, burma, contained, an, express, state, right, to, secede, from, the, union, under, a, number, of, procedural, conditions, it, was, eliminated, in, the, 1974, constitution, of, the, socialist, republic, of, the, union, of, burma, officially, the, union, of, myanmar, burma, still, allows, local, autonomy, under, central, leadership, as, of, 1996, the, constitutions, of, austria, ethiopia, france, and, saint, kitts, and, nevis, have, express, or, implied, rights, to, secession, switzerland, allows, for, the, secession, from, current, and, the, creation, of, new, cantons, in, the, case, of, proposed, quebec, separation, from, canada, the, supreme, court, of, canada, in, 1998, ruled, that, only, both, a, clear, majority, of, the, province, and, a, constitutional, amendment, confirmed, by, all, participants, in, the, canadian, federation, could, allow, secession, the, 2003, draft, of, the, european, union, constitution, allowed, for, the, voluntary, withdrawal, of, member, states, from, the, union, although, the, state, which, wanted, to, leave, could, not, be, involved, in, the, vote, deciding, whether, or, not, they, can, leave, the, union, there, was, much, discussion, about, such, self, determination, by, minorities, before, the, final, document, underwent, the, unsuccessful, ratification, process, in, 2005, as, a, result, of, the, successful, constitutional, referendum, held, in, 2003, every, municipality, in, the, principality, of, liechtenstein, has, the, right, to, secede, from, the, principality, by, a, vote, of, a, majority, of, the, citizens, residing, in, this, municipality, in, determining, international, borders, between, sovereign, states, self, determination, has, yielded, to, a, number, of, other, principles, once, groups, exercise, self, determination, through, secession, the, issue, of, the, proposed, borders, may, prove, more, controversial, than, the, fact, of, secession, the, bloody, yugoslav, wars, in, the, 1990s, were, related, mostly, to, border, issues, because, the, international, community, applied, a, version, of, uti, possidetis, juris, in, transforming, the, existing, internal, borders, of, the, various, yugoslav, republics, into, international, borders, despite, the, conflicts, of, ethnic, groups, within, those, boundaries, in, the, 1990s, indigenous, populations, of, the, northern, two, thirds, of, quebec, province, opposed, being, incorporated, into, a, quebec, nation, and, stated, a, determination, to, resist, it, by, force, the, border, between, northern, ireland, and, the, irish, free, state, was, based, on, the, borders, of, existing, counties, and, did, not, include, all, of, historic, ulster, a, boundary, commission, was, established, to, consider, re, drawing, it, its, proposals, which, amounted, to, a, small, net, transfer, to, the, free, state, were, leaked, to, the, press, and, then, not, acted, upon, in, december, 1925, the, governments, of, the, irish, free, state, northern, ireland, and, the, united, kingdom, agreed, to, accept, the, existing, border, there, have, been, a, number, of, notable, cases, of, self, determination, for, more, information, on, past, movements, see, list, of, historical, separatist, movements, and, lists, of, decolonized, nations, also, see, list, of, autonomous, areas, by, country, and, lists, of, active, separatist, movements, the, republic, of, artsakh, also, known, as, the, nagorno, karabakh, republic, in, the, caucasus, region, declared, its, independence, in, a, 1991, referendum, which, had, an, approval, of, 99, of, voters, however, the, breakaway, state, remained, unrecognized, by, un, states, and, was, disbanded, on,

1990, 2002, and, 2006, since, self, determination, is, not, recognized, in, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1978, some, basques, abstained, and, some, voted, against, it, in, the, referendum, of, december, 6, of, that, year, it, was, approved, by, a, clear, majority, at, the, spanish, level, and, with, 74, 6, of, the, votes, in, the, basque, country, however, the, overall, turnout, in, the,

self, determination, and, achieve, independence, by, the, rule, of, law, after, the, 2012, catalan, march, for, independence, in, which, between, 600, 000, and, 1, 5, million, citizens, marched, the, president, of, catalonia, artur, mas, called, for, new, parliamentary, elections, on, 25, november, 2012, to, elect, a, new, parliament, that, would, exercise, the, right, of, self, determination, for, catalonia, a, right, not, recognised, under, the, spanish, cortes, generales, the, parliament, of, catalonia, voted, to, hold, a, vote, in, the, next, four, year, legislature, on, the, question, of, self, determination, the, parliamentary, decision, was, approved, by, a, large, majority, of, mps, 84, voted, for, 21, voted, against, and, 25, abstained, the, catalan, parliament, applied, to,

was, enacted, only, to, be, blocked, by, the, spanish, constitutional, court, at, the, request, of, the, spanish, government, given, the, block, the, government, turned, it, into, a, simple, consultation, to, the, people, instead, the, question, in, the, consultation, was, do, you, want, catalonia, to, be, a, state, and, if, the, answer, to, this, question, was, yes, do, you, want, this, state, to, be, an, independent, state, however, as, the, consultation, was, not, a, formal, referendum, these, printed, answers, were, just, suggestions, and, other, answers, were, also, accepted, and, catalogued, as, other, answers, instead, as, null, votes, the, turnout, in, this, consultation, was, about, 2, 3m, people, out, of, 6, 2m, people, that, were, called, to, vote, this, figure, does, not, coincide, with, the, census, figure, of, 5, 3m, for, two, main, reasons, first, because, organisers, had, no, access, to, an, official, census, due, to, the, non, binding, character, of, the, consultation, and, second, because, the, legal, voting, age, was, set, to, 16, rather, than, 18, due, to, the, lack, of, an, official, census, potential, voters, were, assigned, to, electoral, tables, according, to, home, address, and, first, family, name, participants, had, to, sign, up, first, with, their, full, name, and, national, id, in, a, voter, registry, before, casting, their, ballot, which, prevented, participants, from, potentially, casting, multiple, ballots, the, overall, result, was, 80, 76, in, favor, of, both, questions, 11, in, favor, of, the, first, question, but, not, of, the, second, questions, 4, 54, against, both, the, rest, were, classified, as, other, answers, the, voter, turnout, was, around, 37, most, people, against, the, consultation, did, not, go, to, vote, four, top, members, of, catalonia, s, political, leadership, were, barred, from, public, office, for, having, defied, the, constitutional, court, s, last, minute, ban, almost, three, years, later, 1, october, 2017, the, catalan, government, called, a, referendum, for, independence, under, legislation, adopted, in, september, 2017, despite, this, legislation, had, been, suspended, by, the, constitutional, court, for, violating, fundamental, rights, of, citizens, with, the, question, do, you, want, catalonia, to, become, an, independent, state, in, the, form, of, a, republic, on, polling, day, the, catalan, regional, police, which, had, been, accused, in, the, past, of, police, brutality, and, impunity, during, the, 15, m, protests, prevented, voting, in, over, 500, polling, stations, without, incidents, in, some, voting, stations, the, catalan, regional, police, did, not, intervene, while, in, other, stations, they, directly, confronted, the, spanish, cnp, national, police, corps, to, allow, voters, to, participate, the, cnp, confiscated, ballot, boxes, and, closed, down, 92, voting, centres, with, violent, truncheon, charges, the, opposition, parties, had, called, for, non, participation, the, turnout, according, to, the, votes, that, were, counted, was, 2, 3m, out, of, 5, 3m, 43, 03, of, the, census, and, 90, 18, of, the, ballots, were, in, favour, of, independence, the, turnout, ballot, count, and, results, were, similar, to, those, of, the, 2014, consultation, under, dzhokhar, dudayev, chechnya, declared, independence, as, the, chechen, republic, of, ichkeria, using, self, determination, russia, s, history, of, bad, treatment, of, chechens, and, a, history, of, independence, before, invasion, by, russia, as, main, motives, russia, has, restored, control, over, chechnya, but, the, separatist, government, functions, still, in, exile, though, it, has, been, split, into, two, entities, the, akhmed, zakayev, run, secular, chechen, republic, based, in, poland, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, and, the, islamic, caucasus, emirate, on, november, 12, 1933, uyghurs, kazakhs, kyrgyz, and, uzbeks, declared, independence, establishing, the, first, east, turkestan, republic, and, again, on, november, 12, 1944, forming, the, second, east, turkestan, republic, their, primary, motivations, included, self, determination, a, history, of, chinese, colonization, and, oppression, in, east, turkistan, and, a, legacy, of, independence, prior, to, the, invasion, by, china, the, manchu, qing, dynasty, the, people, s, republic, of, china, assumed, control, over, east, turkistan, in, late, 1949, however, the, turkic, peoples, of, east, turkistan, predominantly, uyghurs, and, kazakhs, have, persistently, fought, for, their, independence, there, is, a, robust, movement, advocating, east, turkistani, sovereignty, challenging, the, chinese, occupation, since, 1949, the, east, turkistan, government, in, exile, is, at, the, forefront, of, the, east, turkistan, independence, movement, there, is, an, active, secessionist, movement, based, on, the, self, determination, of, the, residents, of, the, eastern, part, of, donetsk, and, the, south, eastern, part, of, the, luhansk, regions, of, eastern, ukraine, however, many, in, the, international, community, assert, that, referendums, held, there, in, 2014, regarding, independence, from, ukraine, were, illegitimate, and, undemocratic, similarly, there, are, reports, that, presidential, elections, in, may, 2014, were, prevented, from, taking, place, in, the, two, regions, after, armed, gunmen, took, control, of, polling, stations, kidnapped, election, officials, and, stole, lists, of, electors, thus, denying, the, population, the, chance, to, express, their, will, in, a, free, fair, and, internationally, recognised, election, there, are, also, arguments, that, the, de, facto, separation, of, eastern, ukraine, from, the, rest, of, the, country, is, not, an, expression, of, self, determination, but, rather, motivated, by, revival, of, pro, soviet, sentiment, and, an, invasion, by, neighbouring, russia, with, ukrainian, president, petro, poroshenko, claiming, in, 2015, that, up, to, 9, 000, russian, soldiers, were, deployed, in, ukraine, the, federal, democratic, republic, of, ethiopia, is, run, as, a, federation, of, semi, self, governing, nation, states, the, constitution, of, ethiopia, firmly, mentions, the, self, determining, nature, of, its, states, the, actual, implementation, of, its, states, self, governance, is, debate, able, self, determination, is, referred, to, in, the, falkland, islands, constitution, and, is, a, factor, in, the, falkland, islands, sovereignty, dispute, the, population, has, existed, for, over, nine, generations, continuously, for, over, 190, years, in, the, 2013, referendum, organised, by, the, falkland, islands, government, 99, 8, voted, to, remain, british, as, administering, power, the, british, government, deemed, that, transfer, of, sovereignty, to, argentina, would, be, counter, to, the, falkland, islander, right, to, self, determination, since, the, majority, of, falkland, island, inhabitants, wished, to, remain, british, argentina, states, the, principle, of, self, determination, is, not, applicable, to, the, islands, since, the, current, inhabitants, are, not, aboriginal, and, were, brought, to, replace, the, argentine, population, which, was, expelled, by, an, act, of, force, compelling, the, argentinian, inhabitants, to, directly, leave, the, islands, this, refers, to, the, re, establishment, of, british, rule, in, the, year, 1833, during, which, argentina, claims, the, existing, population, living, in, the, islands, was, expelled, argentina, thus, argues, that, in, the, case, of, the, falkland, islands, the, principle, of, territorial, integrity, should, have, precedence, over, self, determination, historical, records, dispute, argentina, s, claims, and, whilst, acknowledging, the, garrison, was, expelled, note, the, existing, civilian, population, remained, at, port, louis, and, there, was, no, attempt, to, settle, the, islands, until, 1841, the, right, to, self, determination, is, referred, to, in, the, pre, amble, of, chapter, 1, of, the, gibraltar, constitution, and, since, the, united, kingdom, also, gave, assurances, that, the, right, to, self, determination, of, gibraltarians, would, be, respected, in, any, transfer, of, sovereignty, over, the, territory, is, a, factor, in, the, dispute, with, spain, over, the, territory, the, impact, of, the, right, to, self, determination, of, gibraltarians, was, seen, in, the, 2002, gibraltar, sovereignty, referendum, where, gibraltarian, voters, overwhelmingly, rejected, a, plan, to, share, sovereignty, over, gibraltar, between, the, uk, and, spain, however, the, uk, government, differs, with, the, gibraltarian, government, in, that, it, considers, gibraltarian, self, determination, to, be, limited, by, the, treaty, of, utrecht, which, prevents, gibraltar, achieving, independence, without, the, agreement, of, spain, a, position, that, the, gibraltarian, government, does, not, accept, the, spanish, government, denies, that, gibraltarians, have, the, right, to, self, determination, considering, them, to, be, an, artificial, population, without, any, genuine, autonomy, and, not, indigenous, however, the, partido, andalucista, has, agreed, to, recognise, the, right, to, self, determination, of, gibraltarians, before, the, united, nations, s, adoption, of, resolution, 2908, xxvii, on, 2, november, 1972, the, people, s, republic, of, china, vetoed, the, former, british, colony, of, hong, kong, s, right, to, self, determination, on, 8, march, 1972, this, sparked, several, nations, protest, along, with, great, britain, s, declaration, on, 14, december, that, the, decision, is, invalid, decades, later, an, independence, movement, dubbed, as, the, hong, kong, independence, movement, emerged, in, the, now, communist, chinese, controlled, territory, it, advocates, the, autonomous, region, to, become, a, fully, independent, sovereign, state, the, city,

has, gained, momentum, particularly, after, the, failure, of, the, peaceful, umbrella, movement, young, localist, leaders, have, led, numerous, protest, actions, against, pro, chinese, policies, to, raise, awareness, of, social, problems, of, hong, kong, under, chinese, rule, these, include, the, sit, in, protest, against, the, bill, to, strengthen, internet, censorship, demonstrations, against,

his, territory, was, being, attacked, by, pakistani, tribesmen, the, passing, of, this, act, allowed, jammu, and, kashmir, to, accede, to, india, on, legal, terms, when, this, act, was, taken, to, lord, mountbatten, the, last, viceroy, of, british, india, he, agreed, to, it, and, stated, that, a, referendum, needed, to, be, held, by, the, citizens, in, india, pakistan, and, kashmir, so, that, they, could, vote, as, to, where, kashmir, should, accede, to, this, referendum, that, mountbatten, called, for, never, took, place, and, framed, one, of, the, legal, disputes, for, kashmir, in, 1948, the, united, nations, intervened, and, ordered, a, plebiscite, to, be, taken, in, order, to, hear, the, voices, of, the, kashmiris, if, they, would, like, to, accede, to, pakistan, or, india, this, plebiscite, left, out, the, right, for, kashmiris, to, have, the, right, of, self, determination, and, become, an, autonomous, state, to, this, date, the, kashmiris, have, been, faced, with, numerous, human, rights, violations, committed, by, both, india, and, pakistan, and, have, yet, to, gain, complete, autonomy, which, they, have, been, seeking, through, self, determination, the, insurgency, in, kashmir, against, indian, rule, has, existed, in, various, forms, a, widespread, armed, insurgency, started, in, kashmir, against, india, rule, in, 1989, after, allegations, of, rigging, by, the, indian, government, in, the, 1987, jammu, and, kashmir, state, election, this, led, to, some, parties, in, the, state, assembly, forming, militant, wings, which, acted, as, a, catalyst, for, the, emergence, of, armed, insurgency, in, the, region, the, conflict, over, kashmir, has, resulted, in, tens, of, thousands, of, deaths, the, inter, services, intelligence, of, pakistan, has, been, accused, by, india, of, supporting, and, training, both, pro, pakistan, and, pro, independence, militants, to, fight, indian, security, forces, in, jammu, and, kashmir, a, charge, that, pakistan, denies, according, to, official, figures, released, in, the, jammu, and, kashmir, assembly, there, were, 3, 400, disappearance, cases, and, the, conflict, has, left, more, than, 47, 000, to, 100, 000, people, dead, as, of, july, 2009, however, violence, in, the, state, had, fallen, sharply, after, the, start, of, a, slow, moving, peace, process, between, india, and, pakistan, after, the, peace, process, failed, in, 2008, mass, demonstrations, against, indian, rule, and, low, scale, militancy, emerged, again, however, despite, boycott, calls, by, separatist, leaders, in, 2014, the, jammu, and, kashmir, assembly, elections, saw, highest, voters, turnout, in, last, 25, years, since, insurgency, erupted, as, per, the, indian, government, it, recorded, more, than, 65, of, voters, turnout, which, was, more, than, usual, voters, turnout, in, other, state, assembly, elections, of, india, it, considered, as, increase, in, faith, of, kashmiri, people, in, democratic, process, of, india, however, activists, say, that, the, voter, turnout, is, highly, exaggerated, and, that, elections, are, held, under, duress, votes, are, cast, because, the, people, want, stable, governance, of, the,

largest, degree, of, self, determination, through, the, formation, of, the, kurdistan, regional, government, an, entity, recognised, by, the, iraqi, federal, constitution, although, the, right, of, the, creation, of, a, kurdish, state, was, recognized, following, world, war, i, in, the, treaty, of, s, vres, the, treaty, was, then, annulled, by, the, treaty, of, lausanne, 1923, to, date, two,

which, currently, holds, the, iraqi, presidency, and, the, kurdistan, democratic, party, which, governs, the, kurdistan, regional, government, both, explicitly, commit, themselves, to, the, development, of, kurdish, self, determination, but, opinions, vary, as, to, the, question, of, self, determination, sought, within, the, current, borders, and, countries, efforts, towards, kurdish, self, determination, are, considered, illegal, separatism, by, the, governments, of, turkey, and, iran, and, the, movement, is, politically, repressed, in, both, states, this, is, intertwined, with, kurdish, nationalist, insurgencies, in, iran, and, in, turkey, which, in, turn, justify, and, are, justified, by, the, repression, of, peaceful, advocacy, in, syria, a, self, governing, local,

defined, conglomeration, of, distinct, tribes, living, on, the, border, of, india, and, burma, each, of, these, tribes, lived, in, a, sovereign, village, before, the, arrival, of, the, british, but, developed, a, common, identity, as, the, area, was, christianized, after, the, british, left, india, a, section, of, nagas, under, the, leadership, of, angami, zapu, phizo, sought, to, establish, a, separate, country, for, the, nagas, phizo, s, group, the, naga, national, council, nnc, claimed, that, 99, 9, of, the, nagas, wanted, an, independent, naga, country, according, to, a, referendum, conducted, by, it, it, waged, a, secessionist, insurgency, against, the, government, of, india, the, nnc, collapsed, after, phizo, got, his, dissenters, killed, or, forced, them, to, seek, refuge,

convention, npc, another, major, naga, organization, was, opposed, to, the, secessionists, its, efforts, led, to, the, creation, of, a, separate, nagaland, state, within, india, in, 1963, the, secessionist, violence, declined, considerably, after, the, shillong, accord, of, 1975, however, three, factions, of, the, national, socialist, council, of, nagaland, nscn, continue, to, seek, an, independent, country, which, would, include, parts, of, india, and, burma, they, envisage, a, sovereign, predominantly, christian, nation, called, nagalim, another, controversial, episode, with, perhaps, more, relevance, was, the, british, beginning, their, exit, from, british, malaya, an, experience, concerned, the, findings, of, a, united, nations, assessment, team, that, led, the, british, territories, of, north, borneo, and, sarawak, in, 1963, to, determine, whether, or, not, the, populations, wished, to, become, a, part, of, the, new, malaysia, federation, the, united, nation, team, s, mission, followed, on, from, an, earlier, assessment, by, the, british, appointed, cobbold, commission, which, had, arrived, in, the, territories, in, 1962, and, held, hearings, to, determine, public, opinion, it, also, sifted, through, 1600, letters, and, memoranda, submitted, by, individuals, organisations, and, political, parties, cobbold, concluded, that, around, two, thirds, of, the, population, favoured, to, the, formation, of, malaysia, while, the, remaining, third, wanted, either, independence, or, continuing, control, by, the, united, kingdom, the, united, nations, team, largely, confirmed, these, findings, which, were, later, accepted, by, the, general, assembly, and, both, territories, subsequently, wish, to, form, the, new, federation, of, malaysia, the, conclusions, of, both, the, cobbold, commission, and, the, united, nations, team, were, arrived, at, without, any, referendums, self, determination, being, held, unlike, in, singapore, however, no, referendum, was, ever, conducted, in, sarawak, and, north, borneo, they, sought, to, consolidate, several, of, the, previous, ruled, entities, then, there, was, manila, accord, an, agreement, between, the, philippines, federation, of, malaya, and, indonesia, on, 31, july, 1963, to, abide, by, the, wishes, of, the, people, of, north, borneo, and, sarawak, within, the, context, of, united, nations, general, assembly, resolution, 1541, xv, principle, 9, of, the, annex, taking, into, account, referendums, in, north, borneo, and, sarawak, that, would, be, free, and, without, coercion, this, also,

french, lusignan, dynasty, following, the, death, in, 1473, of, james, ii, the, last, lusignan, king, the, republic, of, venice, assumed, control, of, the, island, while, the, late, king, s, venetian,

the, medieval, period, the, former, assumption, that, greeks, were, treated, only, as, serfs, on, the, island, is, no, longer, considered, by, academics, to, be, accurate, it, is, now, accepted, that, the, medieval, period, saw, increasing, numbers, of, greek, cypriots, elevated, to, the, upper, classes, a, growing, greek, middle, ranks, and, the, lusignan, royal, household, even, marrying, greeks,

a, policy, of, turkish, cypriot, leaders, and, the, republic, of, turkey, in, the, 1950s, politically, there, was, no, majority, minority, relation, between, greek, cypriots, and, turkish, cypriots,
