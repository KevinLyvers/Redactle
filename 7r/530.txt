act, or, an, omission, that, causes, the, death, of, another, and, thus, a, homicide, may, result, from, accidental, reckless, or, negligent, acts, even, if, there, is, no, intent, to, cause, harm, it, is, separate, from, suicide, homicides, can, be, divided, into, many, overlapping, legal, categories, such, as, murder, manslaughter, justifiable, homicide, assassination, killing, in, war, either, following, the, laws, of, war, or, as, a, war, crime, euthanasia, and, capital, punishment, depending, on, the, circumstances, of, the, death, these, different, types, of, homicides, are, often, treated, very, differently, in, human, societies, some, are, considered, crimes, while, others, are, permitted, or, even, ordered, by, the, legal, system, criminal, homicide, takes, many, forms, including, accidental, killing, and, murder, criminal, homicide, is, divided, into, two, broad, categories, murder, and, manslaughter, based, upon, the, state, of, mind, and, intent, of, the, person, who, commits, the, homicide, a, report, issued, by, the, united, nations, office, on, drug, and, crime, in, july, 2019, documented, that, nearly, 464, 000, people, around, the, world, were, killed, in, homicides, in, 2017, a, number, significantly, in, excess, of, the, 89, 000, killed, in, armed, conflicts, during, the, same, period, murder, is, the, most, serious, crime, that, can, be, charged, following, a, homicide, in, many, jurisdictions, murder, may, be, punished, by, life, in, prison, or, even, capital, punishment, although, categories, of, murder, can, vary, by, jurisdiction, murder, charges, fall, under, two, broad, categories, or, degrees, in, some, jurisdictions, a, homicide, that, occurs, during, the, commission, of, a, dangerous, crime, may, constitute, murder, regardless, of, the, actor, s, intent, to, commit, homicide, in, the, united, states, this, is, known, as, the, felony, murder, rule, in, simple, terms, under, the, felony, murder, rule, a, person, who, commits, a, felony, may, be, guilty, of, murder, if, someone, dies, as, a, result, of, the, commission, of, the, crime, including, the, victim, of, the, felony, a, bystander, or, a, co, felon, regardless, their, intent, or, lack, thereof, to, kill, and, even, when, the, death, results, from, the, actions, of, a, co, defendant, or, third, party, who, is, reacting, to, the, crime, the, preterintentional, killing, occurs, when, a, person, with, actions, aimed, at, hitting, or, harming, unintentionally, causes, the, death, of, a, person, the, agent, will, be, liable, for, objective, responsibility, or, fault, for, the, laws, that, require, it, for, the, death, event, manslaughter, is, a, form, of, homicide, in, which, the, person, who, commits, the, homicide, either, does, not, intend, to, kill, the, victim, or, kills, the, victim, as, the, result, of, circumstances, that, would, cause, a, reasonable, person, to, become, emotionally, or, mentally, disturbed, to, the, point, of, potentially, losing, control, of, their, actions, the, distinction, between, murder, and, manslaughter, is, sometimes, said, to, have, first, been, made, by, the, ancient, athenian, lawmaker, draco, in, the, 7th, century, bc, the, penalty, for, manslaughter, is, normally, less, than, the, penalty, for, murder, the, two, broad, categories, of, manslaughter, are, another, form, of, manslaughter, in, some, jurisdictions, is, constructive, manslaughter, which, may, be, charged, if, a, person, causes, a, death, without, intention, but, as, the, result, of, violating, an, important, safety, law, or, regulation, not, all, homicides, are, crimes, or, subject, to, criminal, prosecution, some, are, legally, privileged, meaning, that, they, are, not, criminal, acts, at, all, others, may, occur, under, circumstances, that, provide, the, defendant, with, a, full, or, partial, defense, to, criminal, prosecution, common, defenses, include, the, availability, of, defenses, to, a, criminal, charge, following, a, homicide, may, affect, the, homicide, rate, for, example, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, availability, of, stand, your, ground, defense, has, resulted, in, an, increase, in, the, homicide, rate, in, u, s, jurisdictions, that, recognize, the, defense, including, florida, homicides, committed, by, state, actors, may, be, considered, lawful, or, unlawful, according, to, types, of, state, killings, include, the, term, mass, killing, has, been, proposed, by, genocide, scholars, as, a, concept, to, define, certain, large, scale, killings, of, non, combatants, by, state, actors, some, medium, and, large, scale, mass, killings, by, state, actors, have, been, termed, massacres, though, not, all, such, killings, have, been, so, named, the, term, democide, was, coined, by, american, political, scientist, rudolph, rummel, to, describe, murder, by, government, in, general, which, included, both, extrajudicial, killings, and, widespread, systematic, acts, of, homicide, killings, committed, by, state, actors, might, be, called, murder, or, mass, murder, in, general, usage, especially, if, seen, by, the, commentator, as, unethical, but, the, domestic, legal, definitions, of, murder, manslaughter, etc, usually, exclude, killings, carried, out, by, lawful, government, action, dartmouth, college, professor, benjamin, valentino, outlines, two, major, categories, of, mass, killings, dispossessive, mass, killing, and, coercive, mass, killing, the, first, category, includes, four, subcategories, communist, fascist, ethnic, and, territorial, mass, killings, while, second, category, includes, counterinsurgency, terrorist, and, imperialist, mass, killings, valentino, included, several, prominent, examples, of, dispossessive, mass, killing, to, include, his, arguments, including, the, holodomor, great, leap, forward, and, cambodian, genocide, for, communist, mass, killings, the, white, terror, the, holocaust, and, dirty, war, for, fascist, mass, killings, the, armenian, and, rwandan, genocides, for, ethnic, mass, killings, and, the, american, indian, wars, and, herero, and, nama, genocide, for, territorial, mass, killings, he, also, included, examples, of, coercive, mass, killings, including, counterinsurgency, killings, during, the, algerian, war, and, soviet, afghan, war, terrorist, mass, killings, such, as, strategic, bombing, during, world, war, ii, and, the, blockade, of, biafra, and, german, and, japanese, imperialism, during, world, war, ii, as, examples, of, imperialist, mass, killings, a, 2011, study, by, the, united, nations, office, on, drugs, and, crime, brought, together, a, wide, variety, of, data, sources, to, create, a, worldwide, picture, of, trends, and, developments, sources, included, multiple, agencies, and, field, offices, of, the, united, nations, the, world, health, organization, and, national, and, international, sources, from, 207, countries, the, report, estimated, that, in, 2010, the, total, number, of, homicides, globally, was, 468, 000, more, than, a, third, 36, occurred, in, africa, 31, percent, in, the, americas, 27, percent, in, asia, five, percent, in, europe, and, one, percent, in, oceania, since, 1995, the, homicide, rate, has, been, falling, in, europe, north, america, and, asia, but, has, risen, to, a, near, crisis, point, in, central, america, and, the, caribbean, of, all, homicides, worldwide, 82, percent, of, the, victims, were, men, and, 18, percent, were, women, on, a, per, capita, scaled, level, the, homicide, rate, in, africa, and, the, americas, at, 17, and, 16, per, 100, 000, population, respectively, is, more, than, double, the, global, average, 6, 9, per, 100, 000, whereas, in, asia, europe, and, oceania, between, 3, and, 4, per, 100, 000, it, is, roughly, half, in, its, 2013, global, report, unodc, estimated, the, total, number, of, homicides, worldwide, had, dropped, to, 437, 000, in, 2012, the, americas, accounted,

regions, globally, outside, of, regions, experiencing, wars, and, religious, or, sociopolitical, terrorism, asia, exclusive, of, west, asia, and, central, asia, western, europe, northern, europe, as, well, as, oceania, had, the, lowest, homicide, rates, in, the, world, about, 41, percent, of, the, homicides, worldwide, occurred, in, 2012, with, the, use, of, guns, 24, percent, by, stabbing, with, sharp, objects, such, as, knife, and, 35, percent, by, other, means, such, as, poison, the, global, conviction, rate, for, the, crime, of, intentional, homicide, in, 2012, was, 43, percent, the, 2011, global, study, on, homicide, reported, that, here, homicide, rates, are, high, and, firearms, and, organized, crime, in, the, form, of, drug, trafficking, play, a, substantial, role, 1, in, 50, men,

countries, with, low, levels, of, human, development, high, levels, of, income, inequality, and, weak, rule, of, law, than, in, more, equitable, societies, where, socioeconomic, stability, seems, to, be, something, of, an, antidote, to, homicide, in, cases, of, intimate, partner, and, family, related, homicide, cases, women, murdered, by, their, past, or, present, male, partner, make, up, the, vast, majority, of, homicide, victims, worldwide, in, the, mid, second, millennium, local, levels, of, violence, in, europe, were, extremely, high, by, the, standards, of, modern, developed, countries, typically, small, groups, of, people, would, battle, their, neighbors, using, the, farm, tools, at, hand, such, as, knives, sickles, hammers, and, axes, mayhem, and, death, were, deliberate, the, vast, majority, of, europeans, lived, in, rural, areas, till, 1800, cities, were, few, and, small, in, size, but, their, concentration, of, population, was, conducive, to, violence, and, their, trends, resembled, those, in, rural, areas, across, europe, homicide, trends, show, a, steady, long, term, decline, regional, differences, were, small, except, that, italy, s, decline, was, later, and, slower, from, about, 1200, ad, through, 1800, ad, homicide, rates, from, violent, local, episodes, not, including, military, actions, declined, by, a, factor, of, ten, from, approximately, 32, deaths, per, 100, 000, people, to, 3, 2, per, 100, 000, in, the, 20th, century, the, homicide, rate, fell, to, 1, 4, per, 100, 000, police, forces, seldom, existed, outside, the, cities, prisons, only, became, common, after, 1800, before, then, harsh, penalties, were, imposed, for, homicide, severe, whipping, or, execution, but, they, proved, ineffective, at, controlling, or, reducing, the, insults, to, honor, that, precipitated, most, of, the, violence, the, decline, does, not, correlate, with, economics, or, measures, of, state, control, most, historians, attribute, the, trend, in, homicides, to, a, steady, increase, in, self, control, of, the, sort, promoted, by, protestantism, and, necessitated, by, schools, and, factories, 127, 32, eisner, argues, that, macro, level, indicators, for, societal, efforts, to, promote, civility, self, discipline, and, long, sightedness, are, strongly, associated, with, fluctuations, in, homicide, rates, over, the, past, six, centuries, in, the, us, the, national, violent, death, reporting, system, is, a, centralized, database, of, relevant, information, from, death, certificates, coroner, and, medical, examiner, records,
