heterodox, in, economics, a, market, is, a, composition, of, systems, institutions, procedures, social, relations, or, infrastructures, whereby, parties, engage, in, exchange, while, parties, may, exchange, goods, and, services, by, barter, most, markets, rely, on, sellers, offering, their, goods, or, services, including, labour, power, to, buyers, in, exchange, for, money, it, can, be, said, that, a, market, is, the, process, by, which, the, prices, of, goods, and, services, are, established, markets, facilitate, trade, and, enable, the, distribution, and, allocation, of, resources, in, a, society, markets, allow, any, tradeable, item, to, be, evaluated, and, priced, a, market, emerges, more, or, less, spontaneously, or, may, be, constructed, deliberately, by, human, interaction, in, order, to, enable, the, exchange, of, rights, cf, ownership, of, services, and, goods, markets, generally, supplant, gift, economies, and, are, often, held, in, place, through, rules, and, customs, such, as, a, booth, fee, competitive, pricing, and, source, of, goods, for, sale, local, produce, or, stock, registration, markets, can, differ, by, products, goods, services, or, factors, labour, and, capital, sold, product, differentiation, place, in, which, exchanges, are, carried, buyers, targeted, duration, selling, process, government, regulation, taxes, subsidies, minimum, wages, price, ceilings, legality, of, exchange, liquidity, intensity, of, speculation, size, concentration, exchange, asymmetry, relative, prices, volatility, and, geographic, extension, the, geographic, boundaries, of, a, market, may, vary, considerably, for, example, the, food, market, in, a, single, building, the, real, estate, market, in, a, local, city, the, consumer, market, in, an, entire, country, or, the, economy, of, an, international, trade, bloc, where, the, same, rules, apply, throughout, markets, can, also, be, worldwide, see, for, example, the, global, diamond, trade, national, economies, can, also, be, classified, as, developed, markets, or, developing, markets, in, mainstream, economics, the, concept, of, a, market, is, any, structure, that, allows, buyers, and, sellers, to, exchange, any, type, of, goods, services, and, information, the, exchange, of, goods, or, services, with, or, without, money, is, a, transaction, market, participants, or, economic, agents, consist, of, all, the, buyers, and, sellers, of, a, good, who, influence, its, price, which, is, a, major, topic, of, study, of, economics, and, has, given, rise, to, several, theories, and, models, concerning, the, basic, market, forces, of, supply, and, demand, a, major, topic, of, debate, is, how, much, a, given, market, can, be, considered, to, be, a, free, market, that, is, free, from, government, intervention, microeconomics, traditionally, focuses, on, the, study, of, market, structure, and, the, efficiency, of, market, equilibrium, when, the, latter, if, it, exists, is, not, efficient, then, economists, say, that, a, market, failure, has, occurred, however, it, is, not, always, clear, how, the, allocation, of, resources, can, be, improved, since, there, is, always, the, possibility, of, government, failure, in, economics, a, market, is, a, coordinating, mechanism, that, uses, prices, to, convey, information, among, economic, entities, such, as, firms, households, and, individuals, to, regulate, production, and, distribution, in, his, seminal, 1937, article, the, nature, of, the, firm, ronald, coase, wrote, an, economist, thinks, of, the, economic, system, as, being, coordinated, by, the, price, mechanism, in, economic, theory, we, find, that, the, allocation, of, factors, of, production, between, different, uses, is, determined, by, the, price, mechanism, thus, the, usage, of, the, price, mechanism, to, convey, information, is, the, defining, feature, of, the, market, this, is, in, contrast, to, a, firm, which, as, coase, put, it, the, distinguishing, mark, of, the, firm, is, the, super, session, of, the, price, mechanism, thus, firms, and, markets, are, two, opposite, forms, of, organizing, production, coase, wrote, outside, the, firm, price, movements, direct, production, which, is, co, ordinated, through, a, series, of, exchange, transactions, on, the, market, within, a, firm, these, market, transactions, are, eliminated, and, in, place, of, the, complicated, market, structure, with, exchange, transactions, is, substituted, the, entrepreneur, co, ordinator, who, directs, production, there, are, also, other, hybrid, forms, of, coordinating, mechanisms, in, between, the, hierarchical, firm, and, price, coordinating, market, e, g, global, value, chains, business, ventures, joint, venture, and, strategic, alliances, the, reasons, for, the, existence, of, firms, or, other, forms, of, co, ordinating, mechanisms, of, production, and, distribution, alongside, the, market, are, studied, in, the, theory, of, the, firm, literature, with, various, complete, and, incomplete, contract, theories, trying, to, explain, the, existence, of, the, firm, incomplete, contract, theories, that, are, explicitly, based, on, bounded, rationality, lead, to, the, costs, of, writing, complete, contracts, such, theories, include, transaction, cost, economies, by, oliver, williamson, and, residual, rights, theory, by, groomsman, hart, and, moore, the, market, firm, distinction, can, be, contrasted, with, the, relationship, between, the, agents, transacting, while, in, a, market, the, relationship, is, short, term, and, restricted, to, the, contract, in, the, case, of, firms, and, other, co, ordinating, mechanisms, it, is, for, a, longer, duration, in, the, modern, world, much, economic, activity, takes, place, through, fiat, and, not, the, market, lafontaine, and, slade, 2007, estimates, in, the, us, that, the, total, value, added, in, transactions, inside, the, firms, equal, the, total, value, added, of, all, market, transactions, similarly, 80, of, all, world, trade, is, conducted, under, global, value, chains, 2012, estimate, while, 33, 1996, estimate, is, intra, firm, trade, nearly, 50, of, us, imports, and, 30, of, exports, take, place, within, firms, while, rajan, and, zingales, 1998, have, found, that, in, 43, countries, two, thirds, of, the, growth, in, value, added, between, 1980, and, 1990, came, from, increase, in, firm, size, a, market, is, one, of, the, many, varieties, of, systems, institutions, procedures, social, relations, and, infrastructures, whereby, parties, engage, in, exchange, while, parties, may, exchange, goods, and, services, by, barter, most, markets, rely, on, sellers, offering, their, goods, or, services, including, labour, in, exchange, for, money, from, buyers, it, can, be, said, that, a, market, is, the, process, by, which, the, prices, of, goods, and, services, are, established, markets, facilitate, trade, and, enable, the, distribution, and, allocation, of, resources, in, a, society, markets, allow, any, trade, able, item, to, be, evaluated, and, priced, a, market, sometimes, emerges, more, or, less, spontaneously, or, may, be, constructed, deliberately, by, human, interaction, in, order, to, enable, the, exchange, of, rights, cf, ownership, of, services, and, goods, markets, of, varying, types, can, spontaneously, arise, whenever, a, party, has, interest, in, a, good, or, service, that, some, other, party, can, provide, hence, there, can, be, a, market, for, cigarettes, in, correctional, facilities, another, for, chewing, gum, in, a, playground, and, yet, another, for, contracts, for, the, future, delivery, of, a, commodity, there, can, be, black, markets, where, a, good, is, exchanged, illegally, for, example, markets, for, goods, under, a, command, economy, despite, pressure, to, repress, them, and, virtual, markets, such, as, ebay, in, which, buyers, and, sellers, do, not, physically, interact, during, negotiation, a, market, can, be, organized, as, an, auction, as, a, private, electronic, market, as, a, commodity, wholesale, market, as, a, shopping, center, as, complex, institutions, such, as, international, markets, and, as, an, informal, discussion, between, two, individuals, markets, vary, in, form, scale, volume, and, geographic, reach, location, and, types, of, participants, as, well, as, the, types, of, goods, and, services, traded, the, following, is, a, non, exhaustive, list, financial, markets, facilitate, the, exchange, of, liquid, assets, most, investors, prefer, investing, in, two, markets, there, are, also, in, economics, a, market, that, runs, under, laissez, faire, policies, is, called, a, free, market, it, is, free, from, the, government, in, the, sense, that, the, government, makes, no, attempt, to, intervene, through, taxes, subsidies, minimum, wages, price, ceilings, and, so, on, however, market, prices, may, be, distorted, by, a, seller, or, sellers, with, monopoly, power, or, a, buyer, with, monopsony, power, such, price, distortions, can, have, an, adverse, effect, on, market, participant, s, welfare, and, reduce, the, efficiency, of, market, outcomes, the, relative, level, of, organization, and, negotiating, power, of, buyers, and, sellers, also, markedly, affects, the, functioning, of, the, market, markets, are, a, system, and, systems, have, structure, the, structure, of, a, well, functioning, market, is, defined, by, the, theory, of, perfect, competition, well, functioning, markets, of, the, real, world, are, never, perfect, but, basic, structural, characteristics, can, be, approximated, for, real, world, markets, for, example, markets, where, price, negotiations, meet, equilibrium, but, the, equilibrium, is, not, efficient, are, said, to, experience, market, failure, market, failures, are, often, associated, with, time, inconsistent, preferences, information, asymmetries, non, perfectly, competitive, markets, principal, agent, problems, externalities, or, public, goods, among, the, major, negative, externalities, which, can, occur, as, a, side, effect, of, production, and, market, exchange, are, air, pollution, side, effect, of, manufacturing, and, logistics, and, environmental, degradation, side, effect, of, farming, and, urbanization, there, exists, a, popular, thought, especially, among, economists, that, free, markets, would, have, a, structure, of, a, perfect, competition, the, logic, behind, this, thought, is, that, market, failure, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, other, exogenic, systems, and, after, removing, those, exogenic, systems, freeing, the, markets, the, free, markets, could, run, without, market, failures, for, a, market, to, be, competitive, there, must, be, more, than, a, single, buyer, or, seller, it, has, been, suggested, that, two, people, may, trade, but, it, takes, at, least, three, persons, to, have, a, market, so, that, there, is, competition, in, at, least, one, of, its, two, sides, however, competitive, markets, as, understood, in, formal, economic, theory, rely, on, much, larger, numbers, of, both, buyers, and, sellers, a, market, with, a, single, seller, and, multiple, buyers, is, a, monopoly, a, market, with, a, single, buyer, and, multiple, sellers, is, a, monopsony, these, are, the, polar, opposites, of, perfect, competition, as, an, argument, against, such, logic, there, is, a, second, view, that, suggests, that, the, source, of, market, failures, is, inside, the, market, system, itself, therefore, the, removal, of, other, interfering, systems, would, not, result, in, markets, with, a, structure, of, perfect, competition, as, an, analogy, such, an, argument, may, suggest, that, capitalists, do, not, want, to, enhance, the, structure, of, markets, just, like, a, coach, of, a, football, team, would, influence, the, referees, or, would, break, the, rules, if, he, could, while, he, is, pursuing, his, target, of, winning, the, game, thus, according, to, this, view, capitalists, are, not, enhancing, the, balance, of, their, team, versus, the, team, of, consumer, workers, so, the, market, system, needs, a, referee, from, outside, that, balances, the, game, in, this, second, framework, the, role, of, a, referee, of, the, market, system, is, usually, to, be, given, to, a, democratic, government, disciplines, such, as, sociology, economic, history, economic, geography, and, marketing, developed, novel, understandings, of, markets, studying, actual, existing, markets, made, up, of, persons, interacting, in, diverse, ways, in, contrast, to, an, abstract, and, all, encompassing, concepts, of, the, market, the, term, the, market, is, generally, used, in, two, ways, economics, used, to, be, called, political, economy, as, adam, smith, defined, it, in, the, wealth, of, nations, political, economy, considered, as, a, branch, of, the, science, of, a, statesman, or, legislator, proposes, two, distinct, objects, first, to, provide, a, plentiful, revenue, or, subsistence, for, the, people, or, more, properly, to, enable, them, to, provide, such, a, revenue, or, subsistence, for, themselves, and, secondly, to, supply, the, state, or, commonwealth, with, a, revenue, sufficient, for, the, public, services, it, proposes, to, enrich, both, the, people, and, the, sovereign, the, earliest, works, of, political, economy, are, usually, attributed, to, united, kingdom, scholars, adam, smith, thomas, malthus, and, david, ricardo, although, they, were, preceded, by, the, work, of, the, french, physiocrats, such, as, fran, ois, quesnay, 1694, 1774, and, anne, robert, jacques, turgot, 1727, 1781, smith, describes, how, exchange, of, goods, arose, as, it, is, by, treaty, by, barter, and, by, purchase, that, we, obtain, from, one, another, the, greater, part, of, those, mutual, good, offices, which, we, stand, in, need, of, so, it, is, this, same, trucking, disposition, which, originally, gives, occasion, to, the, division, of, labour, in, a, tribe, of, hunters, or, shepherds, a, particular, person, makes, bows, and, arrows, for, example, with, more, readiness, and, dexterity, than, any, other, he, frequently, exchanges, them, for, cattle, or, for, venison, with, his, companions, and, he, finds, at, last, that, he, can, in, this, manner, get, more, cattle, and, venison, than, if, he, himself, went, to, the, field, to, catch, them, from, a, regard, to, his, own, interest, therefore, the, making, of, bows, and, arrows, grows, to, be, his, chief, business, and, he, becomes, a, sort, of, armourer, another, excels, in, making, the, frames, and, covers, of, their, little, huts, or, moveable, houses, he, is, accustomed, to, be, of, use, in, this, way, to, his, neighbours, who, reward, him, in, the, same, manner, with, cattle, and, with, venison, till, at, last, he, finds, it, his, interest, to, dedicate, himself, entirely, to, this, employment, and, to, become, a, sort, of, house, carpenter, in, the, same, manner, a, third, becomes, a, smith, or, a, brazier, a, fourth, a, tanner, or, dresser, of, hides, or, skins, the, principal, part, of, the, clothing, of, savages, and, thus, the, certainty, of, being, able, to, exchange, all, that, surplus, part, of, the, produce, of, his, own, labour, which, is, over, and, above, his, own, consumption, for, such, parts, of, the, produce, of, other, men, s, labour, as, he, may, have, occasion, for, encourages, every, man, to, apply, himself, to, a, particular, occupation, and, to, cultivate, and, bring, to, perfection, whatever, talent, of, genius, he, may, possess, for, that, particular, species, of, business, and, explains, how, exchanged, mediated, by, money, came, to, dominate, the, market, but, when, barter, ceases, and, money, has, become, the, common, instrument, of, commerce, every, particular, commodity, is, more, frequently, exchanged, for, money, than, for, any, other, commodity, the, butcher, seldom, carries, his, beef, or, his, mutton, to, the, baker, or, the, brewer, in, order, to, exchange, them, for, bread, or, for, beer, but, he, carries, them, to, the, market, where, he, exchanges, them, for, money, and, afterwards, exchanges, that, money, for, bread, and, for, beer, the, quantity, of, money, which, he, gets, for, them, regulates, too, the, quantity, of, bread, and, beer, which, he, can, afterwards, purchase, it, is, more, natural, and, obvious, to, him, therefore, to, estimate, their, value, by, the, quantity, of, money, the, commodity, for, which, he, immediately, exchanges, them, than, by, that, of, bread, and, beer, the, commodities, for, which, he, can, exchange, them, only, by, the, intervention, of, another, commodity, and, rather, to, say, that, his, butcher, s, meat, is, worth, three, pence, or, fourpence, a, pound, than, that, it, is, worth, three, or, four, pounds, of, bread, or, three, or, four, quarts, of, small, beer, hence, it, comes, to, pass, that, the, exchangeable, value, of, every, commodity, is, more, frequently, estimated, by, the, quantity, of, money, than, by, the, quantity, either, of, labour, or, of, any, other, commodity, which, can, be, had, in, exchange, for, it, microeconomics, from, greek, prefix, mikro, meaning, small, and, economics, is, a, branch, of, economics, that, studies, the, behavior, of, individuals, and, small, impacting, organizations, in, making, decisions, on, the, allocation, of, limited, resources, see, scarcity, on, the, other, hand, macroeconomics, from, the, greek, prefix, makro, meaning, large, and, economics, is, a, branch, of, economics, dealing, with, the, performance, structure, behavior, and, decision, making, of, an, economy, as, a, whole, rather, than, individual, markets, the, modern, field, of, microeconomics, arose, as, an, effort, of, neoclassical, economics, school, of, thought, to, put, economic, ideas, into, mathematical, mode, it, began, in, the, 19th, century, debates, surrounding, the, works, of, antoine, augustin, cournot, william, stanley, jevons, carl, menger, and, l, on, walras, this, period, is, usually, denominated, as, the, marginal, revolution, a, recurring, theme, of, these, debates, was, the, contrast, between, the, labor, theory, of, value, and, the, subjective, theory, of, value, the, former, being, associated, with, classical, economists, such, as, adam, smith, david, ricardo, and, karl, marx, marx, was, a, contemporary, of, the, marginalists, a, labour, theory, of, value, can, be, understood, as, a, theory, that, argues, that, economic, value, is, determined, by, the, amount, of, socially, necessary, labour, time, while, a, subjective, theory, of, value, derives, economic, value, from, subjective, preferences, usually, by, specifying, a, utility, function, in, accordance, with, utilitarian, philosophy, in, his, principles, of, economics, 1890, alfred, marshall, presented, a, possible, solution, to, this, problem, using, the, supply, and, demand, model, marshall, s, idea, of, solving, the, controversy, was, that, the, demand, curve, could, be, derived, by, aggregating, individual, consumer, demand, curves, which, were, themselves, based, on, the, consumer, problem, of, maximizing, utility, the, supply, curve, could, be, derived, by, superimposing, a, representative, firm, supply, curves, for, the, factors, of, production, and, then, market, equilibrium, economic, equivalent, of, mechanical, equilibrium, would, be, given, by, the, intersection, of, demand, and, supply, curves, he, also, introduced, the, notion, of, different, market, periods, mainly, long, run, and, short, run, this, set, of, ideas, gave, way, to, what, economists, call, perfect, competition, now, found, in, the, standard, microeconomics, texts, even, though, marshall, himself, was, highly, skeptical, it, could, be, used, as, general, model, of, all, markets, opposed, to, the, model, of, perfect, competition, some, models, of, imperfect, competition, were, proposed, around, the, 1970s, the, study, of, market, failures, came, into, focus, with, the, study, of, information, asymmetry, in, particular, three, authors, emerged, from, this, period, akerlof, spence, and, stiglitz, akerlof, considered, the, problem, of, bad, quality, cars, driving, good, quality, cars, out, of, the, market, in, his, classic, the, market, for, lemons, 1970, because, of, the, presence, of, asymmetrical, information, between, buyers, and, sellers, michael, spence, explained, that, signaling, was, fundamental, in, the, labour, market, since, employers, cannot, know, beforehand, which, candidate, is, the, most, productive, a, college, degree, becomes, a, signaling, device, that, a, firm, uses, to, select, new, personnel, stiglitz, provided, some, general, conditions, under, which, market, equilibrium, is, not, efficient, presence, of, externalities, imperfect, information, and, incomplete, markets, gy, rgy, luk, cs, a, founder, of, western, marxism, wrote, about, the, essence, of, commodity, structure, before, tackling, the, problem, itself, we, must, be, quite, clear, in, our, minds, that, commodity, fetishism, is, a, specific, problem, of, our, age, the, age, of, modern, capitalism, commodity, exchange, and, the, corresponding, subjective, and, objective, commodity, relations, existed, as, we, know, when, society, was, still, very, primitive, what, is, at, issue, here, however, is, the, question, how, far, is, commodity, exchange, together, with, its, structural, consequences, able, to, influence, the, total, outer, and, inner, life, of, society, thus, the, extent, to, which, such, exchange, is, the, dominant, form, of, metabolic, change, in, a, society, cannot, simply, be, treated, in, quantitative, terms, as, would, harmonize, with, the, modern, modes, of, thought, already, eroded, by, the, reifying, effects, of, the, dominant, commodity, form, the, distinction, between, a, society, where, this, form, is, dominant, permeating, every, expression, of, life, and, a, society, where, it, only, makes, an, episodic, appearance, is, essentially, one, of, quality, for, depending, on, which, is, the, case, all, the, subjective, phenomena, in, the, societies, concerned, are, objectified, in, qualitatively, different, ways, human, labour, is, abstracted, and, incorporated, in, commodities, the, ultimate, problem, for, the, thought, of, the, bourgeoisie, is, the, crisis, the, qualitative, existence, of, the, things, misunderstood, as, use, values, become, the, decisive, factor, the, failure, is, characteristic, of, classical, economics, and, bourgeoisie, economics, inadequate, at, explaining, the, true, movement, of, economic, activity, in, toto, the, state, has, a, system, of, law, corresponding, to, capitalist, needs, bureaucracy, formal, standardization, of, justice, and, civil, service, c, b, macpherson, identifies, an, underlying, model, of, the, market, underlying, anglo, american, liberal, democratic, political, economy, and, philosophy, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, persons, are, cast, as, self, interested, individuals, who, enter, into, contractual, relations, with, other, such, individuals, concerning, the, exchange, of, goods, or, personal, capacities, cast, as, commodities, with, the, motive, of, maximizing, pecuniary, interest, the, state, and, its, governance, systems, are, cast, as, outside, of, this, framework, this, model, came, to, dominant, economic, thinking, in, the, later, nineteenth, century, as, so, called, liberal, economists, such, as, ricardo, mill, jevons, walras, and, later, neo, classical, economics, shifted, from, reference, to, geographically, located, marketplaces, to, an, abstract, market, this, tradition, is, continued, in, contemporary, neoliberalism, epitomised, by, the, mont, pelerin, society, which, gathered, frederick, hayek, ludwig, von, mises, milton, friedman, and, karl, popper, where, the, market, is, held, up, as, optimal, for, wealth, creation, and, human, freedom, and, the, states, role, imagined, as, minimal, reduced, to, that, of, upholding, and, keeping, stable, property, rights, contract, and, money, supply, according, to, david, harvey, this, allowed, for, boilerplate, economic, and, institutional, restructuring, under, structural, adjustment, and, post, communist, reconstruction, similar, formalism, occurs, in, a, wide, variety, of, social, democratic, and, marxist, discourses, that, situate, political, action, as, antagonistic, to, the, market, a, central, theme, of, empirical, analyses, is, the, variation, and, proliferation, of, types, of, markets, since, the, rise, of, capitalism, and, global, scale, economies, the, regulation, school, stresses, the, ways, in, which, developed, capitalist, countries, have, implemented, varying, degrees, and, types, of, environmental, economic, and, social, regulation, taxation, and, public, spending, fiscal, policy, and, government, provisioning, of, goods, all, of, which, have, transformed, markets, in, uneven, and, geographical, varied, ways, and, created, a, variety, of, mixed, economies, drawing, on, concepts, of, institutional, variance, and, path, dependence, varieties, of, capitalism, theorists, such, as, peter, hall, and, david, soskice, identify, two, dominant, modes, of, economic, ordering, in, the, developed, capitalist, countries, however, such, approaches, imply, that, the, anglo, american, liberal, market, economies, in, fact, operate, in, a, matter, close, to, the, abstract, notion, of, the, market, while, anglo, american, countries, have, seen, increasing, introduction, of, neo, liberal, forms, of, economic, ordering, this, has, not, led, to, simple, convergence, but, rather, a, variety, of, hybrid, institutional, orderings, rather, a, variety, of, new, markets, have, emerged, such, as, for, carbon, trading, or, rights, to, pollute, in, some, cases, such, as, emerging, markets, for, water, in, england, and, wales, different, forms, of, neoliberalism, have, been, tried, moving, from, the, state, hydraulic, model, associated, with, concepts, of, universal, provision, and, public, service, to, market, environmentalism, associated, with, pricing, of, environmental, externalities, to, reduce, environmental, degradation, and, efficient, allocation, of, water, resources, in, this, case, liberalization, has, multiple, meanings, in, a, period, of, fiscal, and, ideological, crisis, state, failure, is, seen, as, the, catalyst, for, liberalization, however, the, failure, in, assuring, water, quality, can, be, seen, as, a, driver, for, economic, and, ecological, reregulation, in, this, case, coming, from, the, european, union, more, broadly, the, idea, of, a, water, market, failure, can, be, seen, as, the, explanation, for, state, intervention, generating, a, natural, monopoly, of, hydraulic, infrastructure, and, the, regulation, of, externalities, such, as, water, pollution, the, situation, however, is, not, that, simple, as, the, regulator, may, have, the, duty, of, introducing, competition, which, can, be, introduction, of, metering, can, result, in, both, restriction, and, increase, of, consumption, with, lrmc, pricing, being, the, regulator, ofwat, preferred, methodology, paul, dulaney, converse, and, fred, m, jones, wrote, market, distribution, includes, those, activities, which, create, place, time, and, possession, utilities, to, the, economist, market, distribution, is, therefore, part, of, production, because, it, deals, with, the, creation, of, utilities, and, distribution, refers, to, the, distribution, of, wealth, among, the, members, of, society, the, businessman, however, thinks, of, distribution, as, selling, his, goods, and, getting, them, into, the, hands, of, the, consumer, to, the, businessman, distribution, means, marketing, selling, and, transportation, the, methods, of, studying, marketing, are, businesses, market, their, products, services, to, a, specific, segments, of, consumers, the, defining, factors, of, the, markets, are, determined, by, demographics, interests, and, age, gender, a, small, market, is, a, niche, market, while, a, big, market, is, a, mass, market, a, form, of, expansion, is, to, enter, a, new, market, and, sell, advertise, to, a, different, set, of, users, the, marketing, management, school, evolved, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, is, fundamentally, linked, with, the, marketing, mix, framework, a, business, tool, used, in, marketing, and, by, marketers, in, his, paper, the, concept, of, the, marketing, mix, neil, h, borden, reconstructed, the, history, of, the, term, marketing, mix, he, started, teaching, the, term, after, an, associate, james, culliton, described, the, role, of, the, marketing, manager, in, 1948, as, a, mixer, of, ingredients, one, who, sometimes, follows, recipes, prepared, by, others, sometimes, prepares, his, own, recipe, as, he, goes, along, sometimes, adapts, a, recipe, from, immediately, available, ingredients, and, at, other, times, invents, new, ingredients, no, one, else, has, tried, the, functions, of, total, marketing, include, advertising, personal, selling, packaging, pricing, channeling, and, warehousing, borden, also, identified, the, market, forces, affecting, marketing, mix, borden, concludes, saying, that, marketing, is, more, an, art, than, a, science, the, marketer, e, jerome, mccarthy, proposed, a, four, ps, classification, product, price, promotion, place, in, 1960, which, has, since, been, used, by, marketers, throughout, the, world, koichi, shimizu, proposed, a, 7cs, compass, model, corporation, commodity, cost, communication, channel, consumer, circumstances, to, provide, a, more, complete, picture, of, the, nature, of, marketing, in, 1981, robert, f, lauterborn, wrote, about, the, four, p, s, in, 1990, when, jerry, mccarthy, and, phil, kotler, proposed, their, alliterative, litany, product, price, place, and, promotion, the, marketing, world, was, very, different, roaring, out, of, world, war, ii, with, a, cranked, up, production, system, ready, to, feed, a, lust, for, better, living, american, business, linked, management, science, to, the, art, of, mass, marketing, and, rocketed, to, the, moon, in, the, days, of, father, knows, best, it, all, seemed, so, simple, the, advertiser, developed, a, product, priced, it, to, make, a, profit, placed, it, on, the, retail, shelf, and, promoted, it, to, a, pliant, even, eager, consumer, mass, media, simultaneously, taught, consumptive, culture, and, provided, advertisers, with, efficient, access, to, an, audience, which, would, behave, dr, dichter, assured, us, perfectly, predictably, given, the, proper, stimulation, he, instead, advocated, a, four, cs, classification, which, is, a, more, consumer, oriented, version, of, the, four, ps, that, attempts, to, better, fit, the, movement, from, mass, marketing, to, niche, marketing, max, weber, defines, the, measure, of, rational, economic, action, as, the, opposition, of, interests, is, typically, resolved, by, bargaining, or, by, competitive, biding, money, may, classified, as, weber, defines, weber, defines, formal, rationality, of, economic, action, to, designate, the, extent, of, quantitative, calculation, or, accounting, and, substantive, rationality, as, the, degree, a, group, of, persons, is, or, could, be, adequately, provided, with, good, by, means, of, oriented, course, of, social, action, a, prominent, entry, point, for, challenging, the, market, model, s, applicability, concerns, exchange, transactions, and, the, homo, economicus, assumption, of, self, interest, maximization, as, of, 2012, a, number, of, streams, of, economic, sociological, analysis, of, markets, focus, on, the, role, of, the, social, in, transactions, and, on, the, ways, transactions, involve, social, networks, and, relations, of, trust, cooperation, and, other, bonds, economic, geographers, in, turn, draw, attention, to, the, ways, exchange, transactions, occur, against, the, backdrop, of, institutional, social, and, geographic, processes, including, class, relations, uneven, development, and, historically, contingent, path, dependencies, pierre, bourdieu, has, suggested, the, market, model, is, becoming, self, realizing, in, virtue, of, its, wide, acceptance, in, national, and, international, institutions, through, the, 1990s, michel, callon, traces, the, history, of, how, the, market, as, a, place, fairs, flea, markets, fish, markets, became, an, abstract, concept, market, for, ideas, dating, market, job, market, which, he, calls, the, interface, market, model, this, abstraction, proceeds, in, three, layers, the, interface, market, model, thus, establishes, that, the, limitations, of, this, model, are, callon, offer, the, market, agencements, heterogenous, assemblage, model, as, an, alternative, its, features, being, market, agencements, function, through, framing, that, is, action, is, oriented, to, a, strategic, goal, obtaining, bilateral, transactions, for, example, market, oriented, passiva, c, tion, callon, identifies, the, activities, necessary, for, framing, alfred, marshall, wrote, thus, it, is, on, the, one, side, a, study, of, wealth, and, on, the, other, and, more, important, side, a, part, of, the, study, of, man, for, man, s, character, has, been, moulded, by, his, every, day, work, and, the, material, resources, which, he, thereby, procures, more, than, by, any, other, influence, unless, it, be, that, of, his, religious, ideals, and, the, two, great, forming, agencies, of, the, world, s, history, have, been, the, religious, and, the, economic, here, and, there, the, ardour, of, the, military, or, the, artistic, spirit, has, been, for, a, while, predominant, but, religious, and, economic, influences, have, nowhere, been, displaced, from, the, front, rank, even, for, a, time, and, they, have, nearly, always, been, more, important, than, all, others, put, together, religious, motives, are, more, intense, than, economic, but, their, direct, action, seldom, extends, over, so, large, a, part, of, life, for, the, business, by, which, a, person, earns, his, livelihood, generally, fills, his, thoughts, during, by, far, the, greater, part, of, those, hours, in, which, his, mind, is, at, its, best, during, them, his, character, is, being, formed, by, the, way, in, which, he, uses, his, faculties, in, his, work, by, the, thoughts, and, the, feelings, which, i, t, suggests, and, by, his, relations, to, his, associates, in, work, his, employers, or, his, employees, according, to, max, weber, the, spirit, of, capitalism, as, preached, by, benjamin, franklin, is, directly, connected, with, utilitarianism, rationalism, and, protestantism, luther, calling, was, not, a, monastic, one, but, involves, the, fulfilments, of, obligations, imposed, by, one, s, position, in, the, world, the, pursuit, of, money, and, earthly, goods, was, not, viewed, positively, by, protestantism, the, puritans, however, emphasized, that, god, blessings, like, in, the, book, of, job, applied, also, to, material, life, the, limitation, of, consumption, inevitably, results, in, capital, accumulation, therefore, for, weber, the, puritan, s, idea, of, the, calling, and, ascetic, conduct, contributed, to, development, of, capitalism, saving, is, an, ascetic, activity, embeddedness, expresses, the, idea, that, the, economy, is, not, autonomous, but, subordinated, to, politics, religion, and, social, relations, polanyi, s, use, of, the, term, suggests, the, now, familiar, idea, that, market, transactions, depend, on, trust, mutual, understanding, and, legal, enforcement, of, contracts, michel, callon, s, concept, of, framing, provides, a, useful, schema, each, economic, act, or, transaction, occurs, against, incorporates, and, also, re, performs, a, geographically, and, cultural, specific, complex, of, social, histories, institutional, arrangements, rules, and, connections, these, network, relations, are, simultaneously, bracketed, so, that, persons, and, transactions, may, be, disentangled, from, thick, social, bonds, the, character, of, calculability, is, imposed, upon, agents, as, they, come, to, work, in, markets, and, are, formatted, as, calculative, agencies, market, exchanges, contain, a, history, of, struggle, and, contestation, that, produced, actors, predisposed, to, exchange, under, certain, sets, of, rules, therefore, for, challon, market, transactions, can, never, be, disembedded, from, social, and, geographic, relations, and, there, is, no, sense, to, talking, of, degrees, of, embeddedness, and, disembeddeness, during, the, 20th, century, two, common, forms, of, critique, were, made, these, are, common, themes, in, interpretive, social, science, cultural, studies, and, post, structuralism, however, as, timothy, mitchell, points, out, this, mode, of, thought, tends, to, put, aside, the, real, the, natural, and, nonhuman, the, idea, that, a, universal, processes, exists, such, as, modernity, capitalism, and, globalization, should, not, be, taken, for, granted, an, emerging, theme, is, the, interrelationship, inter, penetrability, and, variations, of, concepts, of, persons, commodities, and, modes, of, exchange, under, particular, market, formations, this, is, most, pronounced, in, recent, movement, towards, post, structuralist, theorizing, that, draws, on, michel, foucault, and, actor, network, theory, and, stress, relational, aspects, of, person, hood, and, dependence, and, integration, into, networks, and, practical, systems, commodity, network, approaches, further, both, deconstruct, and, show, alternatives, to, the, market, models, concept, of, commodities, in, social, systems, theory, cf, niklas, luhmann, markets, are, also, conceptualized, as, inner, environments, of, the, economy, as, horizon, of, all, potential, investment, decisions, the, market, represents, the, environment, of, the, actually, realized, investment, decisions, however, such, inner, environments, can, also, be, observed, in, further, function, systems, of, society, like, in, political, scientific, religious, or, mass, media, systems, wilhelm, launhardt, a, location, theorist, wrote, the, conditions, governing, the, distribution, and, settling, of, the, population, over, any, area, are, dependent, on, the, nature, of, its, economic, activity, and, when, this, activity, is, engaged, in, the, cultivation, of, the, surface, of, the, ground, and, in, the, husbandry, of, land, and, wood, and, on, many, kinds, of, handicrafts, and, small, manufactures, this, distribution, is, to, be, assumed, as, uniform, over, the, area, although, as, a, matter, of, fact, the, population, usually, lives, collected, together, in, small, hamlets, and, the, number, of, the, inhabitants, per, unit, of, area, or, density, of, population, varies, according, to, the, local, conditions, another, part, of, the, population, namely, that, which, is, engaged, in, wholesale, commerce, the, various, professions, of, art, and, science, and, that, which, consists, of, merchants, and, officials, lives, collected, in, towns, transportation, can, be, carried, either, by, stone, paved, roads, or, railways, the, former, not, being, fully, developed, by, private, capital, alone, a, widespread, trend, in, economic, history, and, sociology, is, skeptical, of, the, idea, that, it, is, possible, to, develop, a, theory, to, capture, an, essence, or, unifying, thread, to, markets, for, economic, geographers, reference, to, regional, local, or, commodity, specific, markets, can, serve, to, undermine, assumptions, of, global, integration, and, highlight, geographic, variations, in, the, structures, institutions, histories, path, dependencies, forms, of, interaction, and, modes, of, self, understanding, of, agents, in, different, spheres, of, market, exchange, reference, to, actual, markets, can, show, capitalism, not, as, a, totalizing, force, or, completely, encompassing, mode, of, economic, activity, but, rather, as, a, set, of, economic, practices, scattered, over, a, landscape, rather, than, a, systemic, concentration, of, power, problematic, for, market, formalism, is, the, relationship, between, formal, capitalist, economic, processes, and, a, variety, of, alternative, forms, ranging, from, semi, feudal, and, peasant, economies, widely, operative, in, many, developing, economies, to, informal, markets, barter, systems, worker, cooperatives, or, illegal, trades, that, occur, in, most, developed, countries, practices, of, incorporation, of, non, western, peoples, into, global, markets, in, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, did, not, merely, result, in, the, quashing, of, former, social, economic, institutions, rather, various, modes, of, articulation, arose, between, transformed, and, hybridized, local, traditions, and, social, practices, and, the, emergent, world, economy, by, their, liberal, nature, so, called, capitalist, markets, have, almost, always, included, a, wide, range, of, geographically, situated, economic, practices, that, do, not, follow, the, market, model, economies, are, thus, hybrids, of, market, and, non, market, elements, helpful, here, is, j, k, gibson, graham, s, complex, topology, of, the, diversity, of, contemporary, market, economies, describing, different, types, of, transactions, labour, and, economic, agents, transactions, can, occur, in, black, markets, such, as, for, marijuana, or, be, artificially, protected, such, as, for, patents, they, can, cover, the, sale, of, public, goods, under, privatization, schemes, to, co, operative, exchanges, and, occur, under, varying, degrees, of, monopoly, power, and, state, regulation, likewise, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, economic, agents, which, engage, in, different, types, of, transactions, on, different, terms, one, cannot, assume, the, practices, of, a, religious, kindergarten, multinational, corporation, state, enterprise, or, community, based, cooperative, can, be, subsumed, under, the, same, logic, of, calculability, this, emphasis, on, proliferation, can, also, be, contrasted, with, continuing, scholarly, attempts, to, show, underlying, cohesive, and, structural, similarities, to, different, markets, gibson, graham, thus, read, a, variety, of, alternative, markets, for, fair, trade, and, organic, foods, or, those, using, local, exchange, trading, system, as, not, only, contributing, to, proliferation, but, also, forging, new, modes, of, ethical, exchange, and, economic, subjectivities, economic, anthropology, is, a, scholarly, field, that, attempts, to, explain, human, economic, behavior, in, its, widest, historic, geographic, and, cultural, scope, its, origins, as, a, sub, field, of, anthropology, begin, with, the, polish, british, founder, of, anthropology, bronis, aw, malinowski, and, his, french, compatriot, marcel, mauss, on, the, nature, of, gift, giving, exchange, or, reciprocity, as, an, alternative, to, market, exchange, studies, in, economic, anthropology, for, the, most, part, are, focused, on, exchange, but, they, a, complex, relationship, with, the, discipline, of, economics, of, which, it, is, highly, critical, for, example, trobianders, described, by, malinowski, deviate, from, rational, self, interested, individual, bronis, aw, malinowski, s, path, breaking, work, argonauts, of, the, western, pacific, 1922, addressed, the, question, why, would, men, risk, life, and, limb, to, travel, across, huge, expanses, of, dangerous, ocean, to, give, away, what, appear, to, be, worthless, trinkets, he, begins, by, describing, trade, in, the, south, sea, the, coastal, populations, of, the, south, sea, islands, with, very, few, exceptions, are, or, were, before, their, extinction, expert, navigators, and, traders, several, of, them, had, evolved, excellent, types, of, large, sea, going, canoes, and, used, to, embark, in, them, on, distant, trade, expeditions, or, raids, of, war, and, conquest, the, papuo, melanesians, who, inhabit, the, coast, and, the, outlying, islands, of, new, guinea, are, no, exception, to, this, rule, in, general, they, are, daring, sailors, industrious, manufacturers, and, keen, traders, the, manufacturing, centres, of, important, articles, such, as, pottery, stone, implements, canoes, fine, baskets, valued, ornaments, are, localised, in, several, places, according, to, the, skill, of, the, inhabitants, their, inherited, tribal, tradition, and, special, facilities, offered, by, the, district, thence, they, are, traded, over, wide, areas, sometimes, travelling, more, than, hundreds, of, miles, definite, forms, of, exchange, along, definite, trade, routes, are, to, be, found, established, between, the, various, tribes, a, most, remarkable, form, of, intertribal, trade, is, that, obtaining, between, the, motu, of, port, moresby, and, the, tribes, of, the, papuan, gulf, the, motu, sail, for, hundreds, of, miles, in, heavy, unwieldy, canoes, called, lakatoi, which, are, provided, with, the, characteristic, crab, claw, sails, they, bring, pottery, and, shell, ornaments, in, olden, days, stone, blades, to, gulf, papuans, from, whom, they, obtain, in, exchange, sago, and, the, heavy, dug, outs, which, are, used, afterwards, by, the, motu, for, the, construction, of, their, lakatoi, canoes, the, economic, situation, can, vary, considerably, depending, on, the, tribes, and, islands, for, example, the, gumawana, villagers, are, known, as, efficient, sailors, and, for, their, skill, in, pottery, they, are, however, island, monopolists, keeping, the, trade, in, their, own, hands, without, improving, it, in, a, series, of, three, expeditions, malinowski, carefully, traced, the, network, of, exchanges, of, bracelets, and, necklaces, across, the, trobriand, islands, and, established, that, they, were, part, of, a, system, of, inter, tribal, exchange, it, is, known, as, the, kula, ring, a, closed, circuit, in, which, necklaces, of, red, shells, go, in, a, clockwise, motion, and, bracelets, of, white, shell, go, in, anticlockwise, motion, malinowski, goes, on, to, explain, thus, in, the, introduction, we, called, the, kula, a, form, of, trade, and, we, ranged, it, alongside, other, systems, of, barter, this, is, quite, correct, if, we, give, the, word, trade, a, sufficiently, wide, interpretation, and, mean, by, it, any, exchange, of, goods, but, the, word, trade, is, used, in, current, ethnography, and, economic, literature, with, so, many, different, implications, that, a, whole, lot, of, misleading, preconceived, ideas, have, to, be, brushed, aside, in, order, to, grasp, the, facts, correctly, thus, the, aprioric, current, notion, of, primitive, trade, would, be, that, of, an, exchange, of, indispensable, or, useful, articles, done, without, much, ceremony, or, regulation, under, stress, of, dearth, or, need, in, spasmodic, irregular, intervals, and, this, done, either, by, direct, barter, everyone, looking, out, sharply, not, to, be, done, out, of, his, due, or, if, the, savages, were, too, timid, and, distrustful, to, face, one, another, by, some, customary, arrangement, securing, by, means, of, heavy, penalties, compliance, in, the, obligations, incurred, or, imposed, waiving, for, the, present, the, question, how, far, this, conception, is, valid, or, not, in, general, in, my, opinion, it, is, quite, misleading, we, have, to, realise, clearly, that, the, kula, contradicts, in, almost, every, point, the, above, definition, of, savage, trade, it, shows, to, us, primitive, exchange, in, an, entirely, different, light, the, kula, is, not, a, surreptitious, and, precarious, form, of, exchange, it, is, quite, on, the, contrary, rooted, in, myth, backed, by, traditional, law, and, surrounded, with, magical, rites, all, its, main, transactions, are, public, and, ceremonial, and, carried, out, according, to, definite, rules, it, is, not, done, on, the, spur, of, the, moment, but, happens, periodically, at, dates, settled, in, advance, and, it, is, carried, on, along, definite, trade, routes, which, must, lead, to, fixed, trysting, places, sociologically, though, transacted, between, tribes, differing, in, language, culture, and, probably, even, in, race, it, is, based, on, a, fixed, and, permanent, status, on, a, partnership, which, binds, into, couples, some, thousands, of, individuals, this, partnership, is, a, lifelong, relationship, it, implies, various, mutual, duties, and, privileges, and, constitutes, a, type, of, inter, tribal, relationship, on, an, enormous, scale, as, to, the, economic, mechanism, of, the, transactions, this, is, based, on, a, specific, form, of, credit, which, implies, a, high, degree, of, mutual, trust, and, commercial, honour, and, this, refers, also, to, the, subsidiary, minor, trade, which, accompanies, the, kula, proper, finally, the, kula, is, not, done, under, stress, of, any, need, since, its, main, aim, is, to, exchange, articles, which, are, of, no, practical, use, in, the, 1920s, and, later, malinowski, s, study, became, the, subject, of, debate, with, the, french, anthropologist, marcel, mauss, author, of, the, gift, essai, sur, le, don, 1925, malinowski, emphasized, the, exchange, of, goods, between, individuals, and, their, non, altruistic, motives, for, giving, they, expected, a, return, of, equal, or, greater, value, colloquially, referred, to, as, indian, giving, in, other, words, reciprocity, is, an, implicit, part, of, gifting, as, no, free, gift, is, given, without, expectation, of, reciprocity, in, contrast, mauss, has, emphasized, that, the, gifts, were, not, between, individuals, but, between, representatives, of, larger, collectivities, he, stated, that, this, exchange, system, was, clearly, linked, to, political, authority, he, argued, these, gifts, were, a, total, prestation, as, they, were, not, simple, alienable, commodities, to, be, bought, and, sold, but, like, the, crown, jewels, embodied, the, reputation, history, and, sense, of, identity, of, a, corporate, kin, group, such, as, a, line, of, kings, given, the, stakes, mauss, asked, why, anyone, would, give, them, away, and, his, answer, was, an, enigmatic, concept, the, spirit, of, the, gift, a, good, part, of, the, confusion, and, resulting, debate, was, due, to, a, bad, translation, mauss, appeared, to, be, arguing, that, a, return, gift, is, given, to, keep, the, very, relationship, between, givers, alive, a, failure, to, return, a, gift, ends, the, relationship, and, the, promise, of, any, future, gifts, based, on, an, improved, translate, jonathan, parry, has, demonstrated, that, mauss, was, arguing, that, the, concept, of, a, pure, gift, given, altruistically, only, emerges, in, societies, with, a, well, developed, market, ideology, rather, than, emphasize, how, particular, kinds, of, objects, are, either, gifts, or, commodities, to, be, traded, in, restricted, spheres, of, exchange, arjun, appadurai, and, others, began, to, look, at, how, objects, flowed, between, these, spheres, of, exchange, they, shifted, attention, away, from, the, character, of, the, human, relationships, formed, through, exchange, and, placed, it, on, the, social, life, of, things, instead, they, examined, the, strategies, by, which, an, object, could, be, singularized, made, unique, special, one, of, a, kind, and, so, withdrawn, from, the, market, a, marriage, ceremony, that, transforms, a, purchased, ring, into, an, irreplaceable, family, heirloom, is, one, example, whereas, the, heirloom, in, turn, makes, a, perfect, gift, although, arithmetic, has, been, used, since, the, beginning, of, civilization, to, set, prices, it, was, not, until, the, 19th, century, that, data, was, systematically, collected, and, more, advanced, mathematical, tools, began, to, be, used, to, study, markets, in, the, form, of, social, statistics, business, intelligence, is, also, dated, to, the, 19th, century, but, it, was, with, the, rise, of, the, computer, that, business, analytics, exploded, more, recent, techniques, involve, data, mining, and, marketing, engineering, market, size, can, be, given, in, terms, of, the, number, of, buyers, and, sellers, in, a, particular, market, or, in, terms, of, the, total, exchange, of, money, in, the, market, generally, annually, per, year, when, given, in, terms, of, money, market, size, is, often, termed, market, value, but, in, a, sense, distinct, from, market, value, of, individual, products, for, one, and, the, same, goods, there, may, be, different, and, generally, increasing, market, values, at, the, production, level, the, wholesale, level, and, the, retail, level, for, example, the, value, of, the, global, illicit, drug, market, for, the, year, 2003, was, estimated, by, the, united, nations, to, be, us, 13, billion, at, the, production, level, 94, billion, at, the, wholesale, level, taking, seizures, into, account, and, us, 322, billion, at, the, retail, level, based, on, retail, prices, and, taking, seizures, and, other, losses, into, account
