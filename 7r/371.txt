the, bantu, languages, english, uk, b, n, t, u, us, b, n, t, u, proto, bantu, bant, are, a, language, family, of, about, 600, languages, that, are, spoken, by, the, bantu, peoples, of, central, southern, eastern, and, southeast, africa, they, form, the, largest, branch, of, the, southern, bantoid, languages, the, total, number, of, bantu, languages, is, estimated, at, between, 440, and, 680, distinct, languages, depending, on, the, definition, of, language, versus, dialect, many, bantu, languages, borrow, words, from, each, other, and, some, are, mutually, intelligible, some, of, the, languages, are, spoken, by, a, very, small, number, of, people, for, example, the, kabwa, language, was, estimated, in, 2007, to, be, spoken, by, only, 8500, people, but, was, assessed, to, be, a, distinct, language, the, total, number, of, bantu, speakers, is, estimated, to, be, around, 350, million, in, 2015, roughly, 30, of, the, population, of, africa, or, 5, of, the, world, population, bantu, languages, are, largely, spoken, southeast, of, cameroon, and, throughout, central, southern, eastern, and, southeast, africa, about, one, sixth, of, bantu, speakers, and, one, third, of, bantu, languages, are, found, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, the, most, widely, spoken, bantu, language, by, number, of, speakers, is, swahili, with, 16, million, native, speakers, and, 80, million, l2, speakers, 2015, most, native, speakers, of, swahili, live, in, tanzania, where, it, is, a, national, language, while, as, a, second, language, it, is, taught, as, a, mandatory, subject, in, many, schools, in, east, africa, and, is, a, lingua, franca, of, the, east, african, community, other, major, bantu, languages, include, lingala, with, more, than, 20, million, speakers, congo, drc, followed, by, zulu, with, 13, 56, million, speakers, south, africa, xhosa, at, a, distant, third, place, with, 8, 2, million, speakers, south, africa, and, zimbabwe, and, shona, with, less, than, 10, million, speakers, if, manyika, and, ndau, are, included, while, sotho, tswana, languages, sotho, tswana, and, pedi, have, more, than, 15, million, speakers, across, botswana, lesotho, south, africa, and, zambia, zimbabwe, has, kalanga, matebele, nambiya, and, xhosa, speakers, ethnologue, separates, the, largely, mutually, intelligible, kinyarwanda, and, kirundi, which, together, have, 20, million, speakers, the, similarity, among, dispersed, bantu, languages, had, been, observed, as, early, as, the, 17th, century, the, term, bantu, as, a, name, for, the, group, was, not, coined, but, noticed, or, identified, as, b, ntu, by, wilhelm, bleek, as, the, first, european, in, 1857, or, 1858, and, popularized, in, his, comparative, grammar, of, 1862, he, noticed, the, term, to, represent, the, word, for, people, in, loosely, reconstructed, proto, bantu, from, the, plural, noun, class, prefix, ba, categorizing, people, and, the, root, nt, some, entity, any, e, g, xhosa, umntu, person, abantu, people, zulu, umuntu, person, abantu, people, there, is, no, native, term, for, the, people, who, speak, bantu, languages, because, they, are, not, an, ethnic, group, people, speaking, bantu, languages, refer, to, their, languages, by, ethnic, endonyms, which, did, not, have, an, indigenous, concept, prior, to, european, contact, for, the, larger, ethnolinguistic, phylum, named, by, 19th, century, european, linguists, bleek, s, identification, was, inspired, by, the, anthropological, observation, of, groups, frequently, self, identifying, as, people, or, the, true, people, as, is, the, case, for, example, with, the, term, khoikhoi, but, this, is, a, kare, praise, address, and, not, an, ethnic, name, the, term, narrow, bantu, excluding, those, languages, classified, as, bantoid, by, guthrie, 1948, was, introduced, in, the, 1960s, the, prefix, ba, specifically, refers, to, people, endonymically, the, term, for, cultural, objects, including, language, is, formed, with, the, ki, noun, class, nguni, si, as, in, kiswahili, swahili, language, and, culture, isizulu, zulu, language, and, culture, and, kiganda, ganda, religion, and, culture, in, the, 1980s, south, african, linguists, suggested, referring, to, these, languages, as, kintu, the, word, kintu, exists, in, some, places, but, it, means, thing, with, no, relation, to, the, concept, of, language, in, addition, delegates, at, the, african, languages, association, of, southern, africa, conference, in, 1984, reported, that, in, some, places, the, term, kintu, has, a, derogatory, significance, this, is, because, kintu, refers, to, things, and, is, used, as, a, dehumanizing, term, for, people, who, have, lost, their, dignity, in, addition, kintu, is, a, figure, in, some, mythologies, in, the, 1990s, the, term, kintu, was, still, occasionally, used, by, south, african, linguists, but, in, contemporary, decolonial, south, african, linguistics, the, term, ntu, languages, is, used, within, the, fierce, debate, among, linguists, about, the, word, bantu, seidensticker, 2024, indicates, that, there, has, been, a, profound, conceptual, trend, in, which, a, purely, technical, without, any, non, linguistic, connotations, was, transformed, into, a, designation, referring, indiscriminately, to, language, culture, society, and, race, the, bantu, languages, descend, from, a, common, proto, bantu, language, which, is, believed, to, have, been, spoken, in, what, is, now, cameroon, in, central, africa, an, estimated, 2, 500, 3, 000, years, ago, 1000, bc, to, 500, bc, speakers, of, the, proto, bantu, language, began, a, series, of, migrations, eastward, and, southward, carrying, agriculture, with, them, this, bantu, expansion, came, to, dominate, sub, saharan, africa, east, of, cameroon, an, area, where, bantu, peoples, now, constitute, nearly, the, entire, population, some, other, sources, estimate, the, bantu, expansion, started, closer, to, 3000, bc, the, technical, term, bantu, meaning, human, beings, or, simply, people, was, first, used, by, wilhelm, bleek, 1827, 1875, as, the, concept, is, reflected, in, many, of, the, languages, of, this, group, a, common, characteristic, of, bantu, languages, is, that, they, use, words, such, as, muntu, or, mutu, for, human, being, or, in, simplistic, terms, person, and, the, plural, prefix, for, human, nouns, starting, with, mu, class, 1, in, most, languages, is, ba, class, 2, thus, giving, bantu, for, people, bleek, and, later, carl, meinhof, pursued, extensive, studies, comparing, the, grammatical, structures, of, bantu, languages, the, most, widely, used, classification, is, an, alphanumeric, coding, system, developed, by, malcolm, guthrie, in, his, 1948, classification, of, the, bantu, languages, it, is, mainly, geographic, the, term, narrow, bantu, was, coined, by, the, benue, congo, working, group, to, distinguish, bantu, as, recognized, by, guthrie, from, the, bantoid, languages, not, recognized, as, bantu, by, guthrie, in, recent, times, the, distinctiveness, of, narrow, bantu, as, opposed, to, the, other, southern, bantoid, languages, has, been, called, into, doubt, but, the, term, is, still, widely, used, there, is, no, true, genealogical, classification, of, the, narrow, bantu, languages, until, recently, most, attempted, classifications, only, considered, languages, that, happen, to, fall, within, traditional, narrow, bantu, but, there, seems, to, be, a, continuum, with, the, related, languages, of, south, bantoid, at, a, broader, level, the, family, is, commonly, split, in, two, depending, on, the, reflexes, of, proto, bantu, tone, patterns, many, bantuists, group, together, parts, of, zones, a, through, d, the, extent, depending, on, the, author, as, northwest, bantu, or, forest, bantu, and, the, remainder, as, central, bantu, or, savanna, bantu, the, two, groups, have, been, described, as, having, mirror, image, tone, systems, where, northwest, bantu, has, a, high, tone, in, a, cognate, central, bantu, languages, generally, have, a, low, tone, and, vice, versa, northwest, bantu, is, more, divergent, internally, than, central, bantu, and, perhaps, less, conservative, due, to, contact, with, non, bantu, niger, congo, languages, central, bantu, is, likely, the, innovative, line, cladistically, northwest, bantu, is, not, a, coherent, family, but, even, for, central, bantu, the, evidence, is, lexical, with, little, evidence, that, it, is, a, historically, valid, group, another, attempt, at, a, detailed, genetic, classification, to, replace, the, guthrie, system, is, the, 1999, tervuren, proposal, of, bastin, coupez, and, mann, however, it, relies, on, lexicostatistics, which, because, of, its, reliance, on, overall, similarity, rather, than, shared, innovations, may, predict, spurious, groups, of, conservative, languages, that, are, not, closely, related, meanwhile, ethnologue, has, added, languages, to, the, guthrie, classification, which, guthrie, overlooked, while, removing, the, mbam, languages, much, of, zone, a, and, shifting, some, languages, between, groups, much, of, zones, d, and, e, to, a, new, zone, j, for, example, and, part, of, zone, l, to, k, and, part, of, m, to, f, in, an, apparent, effort, at, a, semi, genetic, or, at, least, semi, areal, classification, this, has, been, criticized, for, sowing, confusion, in, one, of, the, few, unambiguous, ways, to, distinguish, bantu, languages, nurse, philippson, 2006, evaluate, many, proposals, for, low, level, groups, of, bantu, languages, but, the, result, is, not, a, complete, portrayal, of, the, family, glottolog, has, incorporated, many, of, these, into, their, classification, the, languages, that, share, dahl, s, law, may, also, form, a, valid, group, northeast, bantu, the, infobox, at, right, lists, these, together, with, various, low, level, groups, that, are, fairly, uncontroversial, though, they, continue, to, be, revised, the, development, of, a, rigorous, genealogical, classification, of, many, branches, of, niger, congo, not, just, bantu, is, hampered, by, insufficient, data, simplified,

for, its, ongoing, classification, based, on, more, recent, linguistic, studies, and, divides, bantu, into, four, main, branches, bantu, a, b10, b20, b30, central, western, bantu, east, bantu, and, mbam, bube, jarawan, guthrie, reconstructed, both, the, phonemic, inventory, and, the, vocabulary, of, proto, bantu, the, most, prominent, grammatical, characteristic, of, bantu, languages, is, the, extensive, use, of, affixes, see, sotho, grammar, and, ganda, noun, classes, for, detailed, discussions, of, these, affixes, each, noun, belongs, to, a, class, and, each, language, may, have, several, numbered, classes, somewhat, like, grammatical, gender, in, european, languages, the, class, is, indicated, by, a, prefix, that, is, part, of, the, noun, as, well, as, agreement, markers, on, verb, and, qualificative, roots, connected, with, the, noun, plurality, is, indicated, by, a, change, of, class, with, a, resulting, change, of, prefix, all, bantu, languages, are, agglutinative, the, verb, has, a, number, of, prefixes, though, in, the, western, languages, these, are, often, treated, as, independent, words, in, swahili, for, example, kitoto, kidogo, kimekisoma, for, comparison, kamwana, kadoko, karikuverenga, in, shona, language, means, the, small, child, has, read, it, kitoto, child, governs, the, adjective, prefix, ki, representing, the, diminutive, form, of, the, word, and, the, verb, subject, prefix, a, then, comes, perfect, tense, me, and, an, object, marker, ki, agreeing, with, implicit, kitabu, book, from, arabic, kitab, pluralizing, to, children, gives, vitoto, vidogo, vimekisoma, vana, vadoko, varikuverenga, in, shona, and, pluralizing, to, books, vitabu, gives, vitoto, vidogo, vimevisoma, bantu, words, are, typically, made, up, of, open, syllables, of, the, type, cv, consonant, vowel, with, most, languages, having, syllables, exclusively, of, this, type, the, bushong, language, recorded, by, vansina, however, has, final, consonants, while, slurring, of, the, final, syllable, though, written, is, reported, as, common, among, the, tonga, of, malawi, the, morphological, shape, of, bantu, words, is, typically, cv, vcv, cvcv, vcvcv, etc, that, is, any, combination, of, cv, with, possibly, a, v, syllable, at, the, start, in, other, words, a, strong, claim, for, this, language, family, is, that, almost, all, words, end, in, a, vowel, precisely, because, closed, syllables, cvc, are, not, permissible, in, most, of, the, documented, languages, as, far, as, is, understood, this, tendency, to, avoid, consonant, clusters, in, some, positions, is, important, when, words, are, imported, from, english, or, other, non, bantu, languages, an, example, from, chewa, the, word, school, borrowed, from, english, and, then, transformed, to, fit, the, sound, patterns, of, this, language, is, sukulu, that, is, sk, has, been, broken, up, by, inserting, an, epenthetic, u, u, has, also, been, added, at, the, end, of, the, word, another, example, is, buledi, for, bread, similar, effects, are, seen, in, loanwords, for, other, non, african, cv, languages, like, japanese, however, a, clustering, of, sounds, at, the, beginning, of, a, syllable, can, be, readily, observed, in, such, languages, as, shona, and, the, makua, languages, with, few, exceptions, such, as, kiswahili, and, rutooro, bantu, languages, are, tonal, and, have, two, to, four, register, tones, reduplication, is, a, common, morphological, phenomenon, in, bantu, languages, and, is, usually, used, to, indicate, frequency, or, intensity, of, the, action, signalled, by, the, unreduplicated, verb, stem, well, known, words, and, names, that, have, reduplication, include, repetition, emphasizes, the, repeated, word, in, the, context, that, it, is, used, for, instance, mwenda, pole, hajikwai, means, he, who, goes, slowly, doesn, t, trip, while, pole, pole, ndio, mwendo, means, a, slow, but, steady, pace, wins, the, race, the, latter, repeats, pole, to, emphasize, the, consistency, of, slowness, of, the, pace, as, another, example, haraka, haraka, would, mean, hurrying, just, for, the, sake, of, hurrying, reckless, hurry, as, in, njoo, haraka, haraka, in, contrast, there, are, some, words, in, some, of, the, languages, in, which, reduplication, has, the, opposite, meaning, it, usually, denotes, short, durations, or, lower, intensity, of, the, action, and, also, means, a, few, repetitions, or, a, little, bit, more, the, following, is, a, list, of, nominal, classes, in, bantu, languages, virtually, all, bantu, languages, have, a, subject, verb, object, word, order, with, some, exceptions, such, as, the, nen, language, which, has, a, subject, object, verb, word, order, following, is, an, incomplete, list, of, the, principal, bantu, languages, of, each, country, included, are, those, languages, that, constitute, at, least, 1, of, the, population, and, have, at, least, 10, the, number, of, speakers, of, the, largest, bantu, language, in, the, country, most, languages, are, referred, to, in, english, without, the, class, prefix, swahili, tswana, ndebele, but, are, sometimes, seen, with, the, language, specific, prefix, kiswahili, setswana, sindebele, in, a, few, cases, prefixes, are, used, to, distinguish, languages, with, the, same, root, in, their, name, such, as, tshiluba, and, kiluba, both, luba, umbundu, and, kimbundu, both, mbundu, the, prefixless, form, typically, does, not, occur, in, the, language, itself, but, is, the, basis, for, other, words, based, on, the, ethnicity, so, in, the, country, of, botswana, the, people, are, the, batswana, one, person, is, a, motswana, and, the, language, is, setswana, and, in, uganda, centred, on, the, kingdom, of, buganda, the, dominant, ethnicity, are, the, baganda, singular, muganda, whose, language, is, luganda, according, to, the, south, african, national, census, of, 2011, map, 1, shows, bantu, languages, in, africa, and, map, 2, a, magnification, of, the, benin, nigeria, and, cameroon, area, as, of, july, 2017, a, case, has, been, made, out, for, borrowings, of, many, place, names, and, even, misremembered, rhymes, chiefly, from, one, of, the, luba, varieties, in, the, usa, some, words, from, various, bantu, languages, have, been, borrowed, into, western, languages, these, include, along, with, the, latin, script, and, arabic, script, orthographies, there, are, also, some, modern, indigenous, writing, systems, used, for, bantu, languages
