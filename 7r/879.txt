war, is, an, armed, conflict, between, the, armed, forces, of, states, or, between, governmental, forces, and, armed, groups, that, are, organized, under, a, certain, command, structure, and, have, the, capacity, to, sustain, military, operations, or, between, such, organized, groups, it, is, generally, characterized, by, extreme, violence, destruction, and, mortality, using, regular, or, irregular, military, forces, warfare, refers, to, the, common, activities, and, characteristics, of, types, of, war, or, of, wars, in, general, total, war, is, warfare, that, is, not, restricted, to, purely, legitimate, military, targets, and, can, result, in, massive, civilian, or, other, non, combatant, suffering, and, casualties, while, some, war, studies, scholars, consider, war, a, universal, and, ancestral, aspect, of, human, nature, others, argue, it, is, a, result, of, specific, socio, cultural, economic, or, ecological, circumstances, the, english, word, war, derives, from, the, 11th, century, old, english, words, wyrre, and, werre, from, old, french, werre, also, guerre, as, in, modern, french, in, turn, from, the, frankish, werra, ultimately, deriving, from, the, proto, germanic, werz, mixture, confusion, the, word, is, related, to, the, old, saxon, werran, old, high, german, werran, and, the, modern, german, verwirren, meaning, to, confuse, to, perplex, to, bring, into, confusion, the, earliest, evidence, of, prehistoric, warfare, is, a, mesolithic, cemetery, in, jebel, sahaba, which, has, been, determined, to, be, about, 13, 400, years, old, about, forty, five, percent, of, the, skeletons, there, displayed, signs, of, violent, death, specifically, traumatic, bone, lesions, in, war, before, civilization, lawrence, h, keeley, a, professor, at, the, university, of, illinois, says, approximately, 90, 95, of, known, societies, throughout, history, engaged, in, at, least, occasional, warfare, and, many, fought, constantly, keeley, describes, several, styles, of, primitive, combat, such, as, small, raids, large, raids, and, massacres, all, of, these, forms, of, warfare, were, used, by, primitive, societies, a, finding, supported, by, other, researchers, keeley, explains, that, early, war, raids, were, not, well, organized, as, the, participants, did, not, have, any, formal, training, scarcity, of, resources, meant, defensive, works, were, not, a, cost, effective, way, to, protect, the, society, against, enemy, raids, william, rubinstein, wrote, pre, literate, societies, even, those, organized, in, a, relatively, advanced, way, were, renowned, for, their, studied, cruelty, since, the, rise, of, the, state, some, 5, 000, years, ago, military, activity, has, continued, over, much, of, the, globe, the, invention, of, gunpowder, and, its, eventual, use, in, warfare, together, with, the, acceleration, of, technological, advances, have, fomented, major, changes, to, war, itself, in, western, europe, since, the, late, 18th, century, more, than, 150, conflicts, and, about, 600, battles, have, taken, place, during, the, 20th, century, war, resulted, in, a, dramatic, intensification, of, the, pace, of, social, changes, and, was, a, crucial, catalyst, for, the, growth, of, left, wing, politics, mao, zedong, urged, the, socialist, camp, not, to, fear, nuclear, war, with, the, united, states, since, even, if, half, of, mankind, died, the, other, half, would, remain, while, imperialism, would, be, razed, to, the, ground, and, the, whole, world, would, become, socialist, a, distinctive, feature, of, war, since, 1945, is, that, combat, has, largely, been, a, matter, of, civil, wars, and, insurgencies, the, major, exceptions, were, the, korean, war, the, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1971, the, iran, iraq, war, the, gulf, war, the, eritrean, ethiopian, war, and, the, russo, ukrainian, war, the, human, security, report, 2005, documented, a, significant, decline, in, the, number, and, severity, of, armed, conflicts, since, the, end, of, the, cold, war, in, the, early, 1990s, however, the, evidence, examined, in, the, 2008, edition, of, the, center, for, international, development, and, conflict, management, s, peace, and, conflict, study, indicated, the, overall, decline, in, conflicts, had, stalled, entities, contemplating, going, to, war, and, entities, considering, whether, to, end, a, war, may, formulate, war, aims, as, an, evaluation, propaganda, tool, war, aims, may, stand, as, a, proxy, for, national, military, resolve, fried, defines, war, aims, as, the, desired, territorial, economic, military, or, other, benefits, expected, following, successful, conclusion, of, a, war, tangible, intangible, aims, explicit, implicit, aims, positive, negative, aims, war, aims, can, change, in, the, course, of, conflict, and, may, eventually, morph, into, peace, conditions, the, minimal, conditions, under, which, a, state, may, cease, to, wage, a, particular, war, throughout, the, course, of, human, history, the, average, number, of, people, dying, from, war, has, fluctuated, relatively, little, being, about, 1, to, 10, people, dying, per, 100, 000, however, major, wars, over, shorter, periods, have, resulted, in, much, higher, casualty, rates, with, 100, 200, casualties, per, 100, 000, over, a, few, years, while, conventional, wisdom, holds, that, casualties, have, increased, in, recent, times, due, to, technological, improvements, in, warfare, this, is, not, generally, true, for, instance, the, thirty, years, war, 1618, 1648, had, about, the, same, number, of, casualties, per, capita, as, world, war, i, although, it, was, higher, during, world, war, ii, wwii, that, said, overall, the, number, of, casualties, from, war, has, not, significantly, increased, in, recent, times, quite, to, the, contrary, on, a, global, scale, the, time, since, wwii, has, been, unusually, peaceful, estimates, for, total, deaths, due, to, war, vary, widely, in, one, estimate, primitive, warfare, from, 50, 000, to, 3000, bce, has, been, thought, to, have, claimed, 400, million, 133, 000, victims, based, on, the, assumption, that, it, accounted, for, the, 15, 1, of, all, deaths, other, scholars, find, the, prehistoric, percentage, much, lower, around, 2, similar, to, the, neanderthals, and, ancestors, of, apes, and, primates, for, the, period, 3000, bce, until, 1991, estimates, range, from, 151, million, to, 2, billion, the, deadliest, war, in, history, in, terms, of, the, cumulative, number, of, deaths, since, its, start, is, world, war, ii, from, 1939, to, 1945, with, 70, 85, million, deaths, followed, by, the, mongol, conquests, at, up, to, 60, million, as, concerns, a, belligerent, s, losses, in, proportion, to, its, prewar, population, the, most, destructive, war, in, modern, history, may, have, been, the, paraguayan, war, see, paraguayan, war, casualties, in, 2013, war, resulted, in, 31, 000, deaths, down, from, 72, 000, deaths, in, 1990, war, usually, results, in, significant, deterioration, of, infrastructure, and, the, ecosystem, a, decrease, in, social, spending, famine, large, scale, emigration, from, the, war, zone, and, often, the, mistreatment, of, prisoners, of, war, or, civilians, for, instance, of, the, nine, million, people, who, were, on, the, territory, of, the, byelorussian, ssr, in, 1941, some, 1, 6, million, were, killed, by, the, germans, in, actions, away, from, battlefields, including, about, 700, 000, prisoners, of, war, 500, 000, jews, and, 320, 000, people, counted, as, partisans, the, vast, majority, of, whom, were, unarmed, civilians, another, byproduct, of, some, wars, is, the, prevalence, of, propaganda, by, some, or, all, parties, in, the, conflict, and, increased, revenues, by, weapons, manufacturers, three, of, the, ten, most, costly, wars, in, terms, of, loss, of, life, have, been, waged, in, the, last, century, these, are, the, two, world, wars, followed, by, the, second, sino, japanese, war, which, is, sometimes, considered, part, of, world, war, ii, or, as, overlapping, most, of, the, others, involved, china, or, neighboring, peoples, the, death, toll, of, world, war, ii, being, over, 60, million, surpasses, all, other, war, death, tolls, military, personnel, subject, to, combat, in, war, often, suffer, mental, and, physical, injuries, including, depression, posttraumatic, stress, disorder, disease, injury, and, death, in, every, war, in, which, american, soldiers, have, fought, in, the, chances, of, becoming, a, psychiatric, casualty, of, being, debilitated, for, some, period, of, time, as, a, consequence, of, the, stresses, of, military, life, were, greater, than, the, chances, of, being, killed, by, enemy, fire, swank, and, marchand, s, world, war, ii, study, found, that, after, sixty, days, of, continuous, combat, 98, of, all, surviving, military, personnel, will, become, psychiatric, casualties, psychiatric, casualties, manifest, themselves, in, fatigue, cases, confusional, states, conversion, hysteria, anxiety, obsessional, and, compulsive, states, and, character, disorders, one, tenth, of, mobilised, american, men, were, hospitalised, for, mental, disturbances, between, 1942, and, 1945, and, after, thirty, five, days, of, uninterrupted, combat, 98, of, them, manifested, psychiatric, disturbances, in, varying, degrees, additionally, it, has, been, estimated, anywhere, from, 18, to, 54, of, vietnam, war, veterans, suffered, from, posttraumatic, stress, disorder, based, on, 1860, census, figures, 8, of, all, white, american, males, aged, 13, to, 43, died, in, the, american, civil, war, including, about, 6, in, the, north, and, approximately, 18, in, the, south, the, war, remains, the, deadliest, conflict, in, american, history, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, 620, 000, military, personnel, united, states, military, casualties, of, war, since, 1775, have, totaled, over, two, million, of, the, 60, million, european, military, personnel, who, were, mobilized, in, world, war, i, 8, million, were, killed, 7, million, were, permanently, disabled, and, 15, million, were, seriously, injured, during, napoleon, s, retreat, from, moscow, more, french, military, personnel, died, of, typhus, than, were, killed, by, the, russians, of, the, 450, 000, soldiers, who, crossed, the, neman, on, 25, june, 1812, less, than, 40, 000, returned, more, military, personnel, were, killed, from, 1500, to, 1914, by, typhus, than, from, military, action, in, addition, if, it, were, not, for, modern, medical, advances, there, would, be, thousands, more, dead, from, disease, and, infection, for, instance, during, the, seven, years, war, the, royal, navy, reported, it, conscripted, 184, 899, sailors, of, whom, 133, 708, 72, died, of, disease, or, were, missing, it, is, estimated, that, between, 1985, and, 1994, 378, 000, people, per, year, died, due, to, war, most, wars, have, resulted, in, significant, loss, of, life, along, with, destruction, of, infrastructure, and, resources, which, may, lead, to, famine, disease, and, death, in, the, civilian, population, during, the, thirty, years, war, in, europe, the, population, of, the, holy, roman, empire, was, reduced, by, 15, to, 40, percent, civilians, in, war, zones, may, also, be, subject, to, war, atrocities, such, as, genocide, while, survivors, may, suffer, the, psychological, aftereffects, of, witnessing, the, destruction, of, war, war, also, results, in, lower, quality, of, life, and, worse, health, outcomes, a, medium, sized, conflict, with, about, 2, 500, battle, deaths, reduces, civilian, life, expectancy, by, one, year, and, increases, infant, mortality, by, 10, and, malnutrition, by, 3, 3, additionally, about, 1, 8, of, the, population, loses, access, to, drinking, water, most, estimates, of, world, war, ii, casualties, indicate, around, 60, million, people, died, 40, million, of, whom, were, civilians, deaths, in, the, soviet, union, were, around, 27, million, since, a, high, proportion, of, those, killed, were, young, men, who, had, not, yet, fathered, any, children, population, growth, in, the, postwar, soviet, union, was, much, lower, than, it, otherwise, would, have, been, once, a, war, has, ended, losing, nations, are, sometimes, required, to, pay, war, reparations, to, the, victorious, nations, in, certain, cases, land, is, ceded, to, the, victorious, nations, for, example, the, territory, of, alsace, lorraine, has, been, traded, between, france, and, germany, on, three, different, occasions, typically, war, becomes, intertwined, with, the, economy, and, many, wars, are, partially, or, entirely, based, on, economic, reasons, the, common, view, among, economic, historians, is, that, the, great, depression, ended, with, the, advent, of, world, war, ii, many, economists, believe, that, government, spending, on, the, war, caused, or, at, least, accelerated, recovery, from, the, great, depression, though, some, consider, that, it, did, not, play, a, very, large, role, in, the, recovery, though, it, did, help, in, reducing, unemployment, in, most, cases, such, as, the, wars, of, louis, xiv, the, franco, prussian, war, and, world, war, i, warfare, primarily, results, in, damage, to, the, economy, of, the, countries, involved, for, example, russia, s, involvement, in, world, war, i, took, such, a, toll, on, the, russian, economy, that, it, almost, collapsed, and, greatly, contributed, to, the, start, of, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, world, war, ii, was, the, most, financially, costly, conflict, in, history, its, belligerents, cumulatively, spent, about, a, trillion, u, s, dollars, on, the, war, effort, as, adjusted, to, 1940, prices, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, ended, as, nations, increased, their, production, of, war, materials, by, the, end, of, the, war, 70, of, european, industrial, infrastructure, was, destroyed, property, damage, in, the, soviet, union, inflicted, by, the, axis, invasion, was, estimated, at, a, value, of, 679, billion, rubles, the, combined, damage, consisted, of, complete, or, partial, destruction, of, 1, 710, cities, and, towns, 70, 000, villages, hamlets, 2, 508, church, buildings, 31, 850, industrial, establishments, 40, 000, mi, 64, 374, km, of, railroad, 4100, railroad, stations, 40, 000, hospitals, 84, 000, schools, and, 43, 000, public, libraries, there, are, many, theories, about, the, motivations, for, war, but, no, consensus, about, which, are, most, common, military, theorist, carl, von, clausewitz, said, every, age, has, its, own, kind, of, war, its, own, limiting, conditions, and, its, own, peculiar, preconceptions, dutch, psychoanalyst, joost, meerloo, held, that, war, is, often, a, mass, discharge, of, accumulated, internal, rage, where, the, inner, fears, of, mankind, are, discharged, in, mass, destruction, other, psychoanalysts, such, as, e, f, m, durban, and, john, bowlby, have, argued, human, beings, are, inherently, violent, this, aggressiveness, is, fueled, by, displacement, and, projection, where, a, person, transfers, his, or, her, grievances, into, bias, and, hatred, against, other, races, religions, nations, or, ideologies, by, this, theory, the, nation, state, preserves, order, in, the, local, society, while, creating, an, outlet, for, aggression, through, warfare, the, italian, psychoanalyst, franco, fornari, a, follower, of, melanie, klein, thought, war, was, the, paranoid, or, projective, elaboration, of, mourning, fornari, thought, war, and, violence, develop, out, of, our, love, need, our, wish, to, preserve, and, defend, the, sacred, object, to, which, we, are, attached, namely, our, early, mother, and, our, fusion, with, her, for, the, adult, nations, are, the, sacred, objects, that, generate, warfare, fornari, focused, upon, sacrifice, as, the, essence, of, war, the, astonishing, willingness, of, human, beings, to, die, for, their, country, to, give, over, their, bodies, to, their, nation, despite, fornari, s, theory, that, man, s, altruistic, desire, for, self, sacrifice, for, a, noble, cause, is, a, contributing, factor, towards, war, few, wars, have, originated, from, a, desire, for, war, among, the, general, populace, far, more, often, the, general, population, has, been, reluctantly, drawn, into, war, by, its, rulers, one, psychological, theory, that, looks, at, the, leaders, is, advanced, by, maurice, walsh, he, argues, the, general, populace, is, more, neutral, towards, war, and, wars, occur, when, leaders, with, a, psychologically, abnormal, disregard, for, human, life, are, placed, into, power, war, is, caused, by, leaders, who, seek, war, such, as, napoleon, and, hitler, such, leaders, most, often, come, to, power, in, times, of, crisis, when, the, populace, opts, for, a, decisive, leader, who, then, leads, the, nation, to, war, naturally, the, common, people, don, t, want, war, neither, in, russia, nor, in, england, nor, in, america, nor, for, that, matter, in, germany, that, is, understood, but, after, all, it, is, the, leaders, of, the, country, who, determine, the, policy, and, it, is, always, a, simple, matter, to, drag, the, people, along, whether, it, is, a, democracy, or, a, fascist, dictatorship, or, a, parliament, or, a, communist, dictatorship, the, people, can, always, be, brought, to, the, bidding, of, the, leaders, that, is, easy, all, you, have, to, do, is, tell, them, they, are, being, attacked, and, denounce, the, pacifists, for, lack, of, patriotism, and, exposing, the, country, to, danger, it, works, the, same, way, in, any, country, several, theories, concern, the, evolutionary, origins, of, warfare, there, are, two, main, schools, one, sees, organized, warfare, as, emerging, in, or, after, the, mesolithic, as, a, result, of, complex, social, organization, and, greater, population, density, and, competition, over, resources, the, other, sees, human, warfare, as, a, more, ancient, practice, derived, from, common, animal, tendencies, such, as, territoriality, and, sexual, competition, the, latter, school, argues, that, since, warlike, behavior, patterns, are, found, in, many, primate, species, such, as, chimpanzees, as, well, as, in, many, ant, species, group, conflict, may, be, a, general, feature, of, animal, social, behavior, some, proponents, of, the, idea, argue, that, war, while, innate, has, been, intensified, greatly, by, developments, of, technology, and, social, organization, such, as, weaponry, and, states, psychologist, and, linguist, steven, pinker, argued, that, war, related, behaviors, may, have, been, naturally, selected, in, the, ancestral, environment, due, to, the, benefits, of, victory, he, also, argued, that, in, order, to, have, credible, deterrence, against, other, groups, as, well, as, on, an, individual, level, it, was, important, to, have, a, reputation, for, retaliation, causing, humans, to, develop, instincts, for, revenge, as, well, as, for, protecting, a, group, s, or, an, individual, s, reputation, honor, crofoot, and, wrangham, have, argued, that, warfare, if, defined, as, group, interactions, in, which, coalitions, attempt, to, aggressively, dominate, or, kill, members, of, other, groups, is, a, characteristic, of, most, human, societies, those, in, which, it, has, been, lacking, tend, to, be, societies, that, were, politically, dominated, by, their, neighbors, ashley, montagu, strongly, denied, universalistic, instinctual, arguments, arguing, that, social, factors, and, childhood, socialization, are, important, in, determining, the, nature, and, presence, of, warfare, thus, he, argues, warfare, is, not, a, universal, human, occurrence, and, appears, to, have, been, a, historical, invention, associated, with, certain, types, of, human, societies, montagu, s, argument, is, supported, by, ethnographic, research, conducted, in, societies, where, the, concept, of, aggression, seems, to, be, entirely, absent, e, g, the, chewong, and, semai, of, the, malay, peninsula, bobbi, s, low, has, observed, correlation, between, warfare, and, education, noting, societies, where, warfare, is, commonplace, encourage, their, children, to, be, more, aggressive, war, can, be, seen, as, a, growth, of, economic, competition, in, a, competitive, international, system, in, this, view, wars, begin, as, a, pursuit, of, markets, for, natural, resources, and, for, wealth, war, has, also, been, linked, to, economic, development, by, economic, historians, and, development, economists, studying, state, building, and, fiscal, capacity, while, this, theory, has, been, applied, to, many, conflicts, such, counter, arguments, become, less, valid, as, the, increasing, mobility, of, capital, and, information, level, the, distributions, of, wealth, worldwide, or, when, considering, that, it, is, relative, not, absolute, wealth, differences, that, may, fuel, wars, there, are, those, on, the, extreme, right, of, the, political, spectrum, who, provide, support, fascists, in, particular, by, asserting, a, natural, right, of, a, strong, nation, to, whatever, the, weak, cannot, hold, by, force, some, centrist, capitalist, world, leaders, including, presidents, of, the, united, states, and, u, s, generals, expressed, support, for, an, economic, view, of, war, the, marxist, theory, of, war, is, quasi, economic, in, that, it, states, all, modern, wars, are, caused, by, competition, for, resources, and, markets, between, great, imperialist, powers, claiming, these, wars, are, a, natural, result, of, capitalism, marxist, economists, karl, kautsky, rosa, luxemburg, rudolf, hilferding, and, vladimir, lenin, theorized, that, imperialism, was, the, result, of, capitalist, countries, needing, new, markets, expansion, of, the, means, of, production, is, only, possible, if, there, is, a, corresponding, growth, in, consumer, demand, since, the, workers, in, a, capitalist, economy, would, be, unable, to, fill, the, demand, producers, must, expand, into, non, capitalist, markets, to, find, consumers, for, their, goods, hence, driving, imperialism, demographic, theories, can, be, grouped, into, two, classes, malthusian, and, youth, bulge, theories, malthusian, theories, see, expanding, population, and, scarce, resources, as, a, source, of, violent, conflict, pope, urban, ii, in, 1095, on, the, eve, of, the, first, crusade, advocating, crusade, as, a, solution, to, european, overpopulation, said, for, this, land, which, you, now, inhabit, shut, in, on, all, sides, by, the, sea, and, the, mountain, peaks, is, too, narrow, for, your, large, population, it, scarcely, furnishes, food, enough, for, its, cultivators, hence, it, is, that, you, murder, and, devour, one, another, that, you, wage, wars, and, that, many, among, you, perish, in, civil, strife, let, hatred, therefore, depart, from, among, you, let, your, quarrels, end, enter, upon, the, road, to, the, holy, sepulchre, wrest, that, land, from, a, wicked, race, and, subject, it, to, yourselves, this, is, one, of, the, earliest, expressions, of, what, has, come, to, be, called, the, malthusian, theory, of, war, in, which, wars, are, caused, by, expanding, populations, and, limited, resources, thomas, malthus, 1766, 1834, wrote, that, populations, always, increase, until, they, are, limited, by, war, disease, or, famine, the, violent, herder, farmer, conflicts, in, nigeria, mali, sudan, and, other, countries, in, the, sahel, region, have, been, exacerbated, by, land, degradation, and, population, growth, according, to, heinsohn, who, proposed, youth, bulge, theory, in, its, most, generalized, form, a, youth, bulge, occurs, when, 30, to, 40, percent, of, the, males, of, a, nation, belong, to, the, fighting, age, cohorts, from, 15, to, 29, years, of, age, it, will, follow, periods, with, total, fertility, rates, as, high, as, 4, 8, children, per, woman, with, a, 15, 29, year, delay, heinsohn, saw, both, past, christianist, european, colonialism, and, imperialism, as, well, as, today, s, islamist, civil, unrest, and, terrorism, as, results, of, high, birth, rates, producing, youth, bulges, among, prominent, historical, events, that, have, been, attributed, to, youth, bulges, are, the, role, played, by, the, historically, large, youth, cohorts, in, the, rebellion, and, revolution, waves, of, early, modern, europe, including, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, and, the, effect, of, economic, depression, upon, the, largest, german, youth, cohorts, ever, in, explaining, the, rise, of, nazism, in, germany, in, the, 1930s, the, 1994, rwandan, genocide, has, also, been, analyzed, as, following, a, massive, youth, bulge, youth, bulge, theory, has, been, subjected, to, statistical, analysis, by, the, world, bank, population, action, international, and, the, berlin, institute, for, population, and, development, youth, bulge, theories, have, been, criticized, as, leading, to, racial, gender, and, age, discrimination, geoffrey, parker, argues, that, what, distinguishes, the, western, way, of, war, based, in, western, europe, chiefly, allows, historians, to, explain, its, extraordinary, success, in, conquering, most, of, the, world, after, 1500, the, western, way, of, war, rests, upon, five, principal, foundations, technology, discipline, a, highly, aggressive, military, tradition, a, remarkable, capacity, to, innovate, and, to, respond, rapidly, to, the, innovation, of, others, and, from, about, 1500, onward, a, unique, system, of, war, finance, the, combination, of, all, five, provided, a, formula, for, military, success, the, outcome, of, wars, has, been, determined, less, by, technology, then, by, better, war, plans, the, achievement, of, surprise, greater, economic, strength, and, above, all, superior, discipline, parker, argues, that, western, armies, were, stronger, because, they, emphasized, discipline, that, is, the, ability, of, a, formation, to, stand, fast, in, the, face, of, the, enemy, where, they, re, attacking, or, being, attacked, without, giving, way, to, the, natural, impulse, of, fear, and, panic, discipline, came, from, drills, and, marching, in, formation, target, practice, and, creating, small, artificial, kinship, groups, such, as, the, company, and, the, platoon, to, enhance, psychological, cohesion, and, combat, efficiency, rationalism, is, an, international, relations, theory, or, framework, rationalism, and, neorealism, international, relations, operate, under, the, assumption, that, states, or, international, actors, are, rational, seek, the, best, possible, outcomes, for, themselves, and, desire, to, avoid, the, costs, of, war, under, one, game, theory, approach, rationalist, theories, posit, all, actors, can, bargain, would, be, better, off, if, war, did, not, occur, and, likewise, seek, to, understand, why, war, nonetheless, reoccurs, under, another, rationalist, game, theory, without, bargaining, the, peace, war, game, optimal, strategies, can, still, be, found, that, depend, upon, number, of, iterations, played, in, rationalist, explanations, for, war, james, fearon, examined, three, rationalist, explanations, for, why, some, countries, engage, in, war, issue, indivisibility, occurs, when, the, two, parties, cannot, avoid, war, by, bargaining, because, the, thing, over, which, they, are, fighting, cannot, be, shared, between, them, but, only, owned, entirely, by, one, side, or, the, other, information, asymmetry, with, incentives, to, misrepresent, occurs, when, two, countries, have, secrets, about, their, individual, capabilities, and, do, not, agree, on, either, who, would, win, a, war, between, them, or, the, magnitude, of, state, s, victory, or, loss, for, instance, geoffrey, blainey, argues, that, war, is, a, result, of, miscalculation, of, strength, he, cites, historical, examples, of, war, and, demonstrates, war, is, usually, the, outcome, of, a, diplomatic, crisis, which, cannot, be, solved, because, both, sides, have, conflicting, estimates, of, their, bargaining, power, thirdly, bargaining, may, fail, due, to, the, states, inability, to, make, credible, commitments, within, the, rationalist, tradition, some, theorists, have, suggested, that, individuals, engaged, in, war, suffer, a, normal, level, of, cognitive, bias, but, are, still, as, rational, as, you, and, me, according, to, philosopher, iain, king, most, instigators, of, conflict, overrate, their, chances, of, success, while, most, participants, underrate, their, chances, of, injury, king, asserts, that, most, catastrophic, military, decisions, are, rooted, in, groupthink, which, is, faulty, but, still, rational, the, rationalist, theory, focused, around, bargaining, which, is, currently, under, debate, the, iraq, war, proved, to, be, an, anomaly, that, undercuts, the, validity, of, applying, rationalist, theory, to, some, wars, the, statistical, analysis, of, war, was, pioneered, by, lewis, fry, richardson, following, world, war, i, more, recent, databases, of, wars, and, armed, conflict, have, been, assembled, by, the, correlates, of, war, project, peter, brecke, and, the, uppsala, conflict, data, program, the, following, subsections, consider, causes, of, war, from, system, societal, and, individual, levels, of, analysis, this, kind, of, division, was, first, proposed, by, kenneth, waltz, in, man, the, state, and, war, and, has, been, often, used, by, political, scientists, since, then, 143, there, are, several, different, international, relations, theory, schools, supporters, of, realism, in, international, relations, argue, that, the, motivation, of, states, is, the, quest, for, security, and, conflicts, can, arise, from, the, inability, to, distinguish, defense, from, offense, which, is, called, the, security, dilemma, 145, within, the, realist, school, as, represented, by, scholars, such, as, henry, kissinger, and, hans, morgenthau, and, the, neorealist, school, represented, by, scholars, such, as, kenneth, waltz, and, john, mearsheimer, two, main, sub, theories, are, the, two, theories, are, not, mutually, exclusive, and, may, be, used, to, explain, disparate, events, according, to, the, circumstance, 148, liberalism, as, it, relates, to, international, relations, emphasizes, factors, such, as, trade, and, its, role, in, disincentivizing, conflict, which, will, damage, economic, relations, critics, respond, that, military, force, may, sometimes, be, at, least, as, effective, as, trade, at, achieving, economic, benefits, especially, historically, if, not, as, much, today, 149, furthermore, trade, relations, which, result, in, a, high, level, of, dependency, may, escalate, tensions, and, lead, to, conflict, 150, empirical, data, on, the, relationship, of, trade, to, peace, are, mixed, and, moreover, some, evidence, suggests, countries, at, war, do, not, necessarily, trade, less, with, each, other, 150, these, theories, suggest, differences, in, people, s, personalities, decision, making, emotions, belief, systems, and, biases, are, important, in, determining, whether, conflicts, get, out, of, hand, 157, for, instance, it, has, been, proposed, that, conflict, is, modulated, by, bounded, rationality, and, various, cognitive, biases, 157, such, as, prospect, theory, the, morality, of, war, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, for, thousands, of, years, the, two, principal, aspects, of, ethics, in, war, according, to, the, just, war, theory, are, jus, ad, bellum, and, jus, in, bello, jus, ad, bellum, right, to, war, dictates, which, unfriendly, acts, and, circumstances, justify, a, proper, authority, in, declaring, war, on, another, nation, there, are, six, main, criteria, for, the, declaration, of, a, just, war, first, any, just, war, must, be, declared, by, a, lawful, authority, second, it, must, be, a, just, and, righteous, cause, with, sufficient, gravity, to, merit, large, scale, violence, third, the, just, belligerent, must, have, rightful, intentions, namely, that, they, seek, to, advance, good, and, curtail, evil, fourth, a, just, belligerent, must, have, a, reasonable, chance, of, success, fifth, the, war, must, be, a, last, resort, and, sixth, the, ends, being, sought, must, be, proportional, to, means, being, used, jus, in, bello, right, in, war, is, the, set, of, ethical, rules, when, conducting, war, the, two, main, principles, are, proportionality, and, discrimination, proportionality, regards, how, much, force, is, necessary, and, morally, appropriate, to, the, ends, being, sought, and, the, injustice, suffered, the, principle, of, discrimination, determines, who, are, the, legitimate, targets, in, a, war, and, specifically, makes, a, separation, between, combatants, who, it, is, permissible, to, kill, and, non, combatants, who, it, is, not, failure, to, follow, these, rules, can, result, in, the, loss, of, legitimacy, for, the, just, war, belligerent, the, just, war, theory, was, foundational, in, the, creation, of, the, united, nations, and, in, international, law, s, regulations, on, legitimate, war, lewis, coser, an, american, conflict, theorist, and, sociologist, argued, conflict, provides, a, function, and, a, process, whereby, a, succession, of, new, equilibriums, are, created, thus, the, struggle, of, opposing, forces, rather, than, being, disruptive, may, be, a, means, of, balancing, and, maintaining, a, social, structure, or, society, religious, groups, have, long, formally, opposed, or, sought, to, limit, war, as, in, the, second, vatican, council, document, gaudiem, et, spes, any, act, of, war, aimed, indiscriminately, at, the, destruction, of, entire, cities, of, extensive, areas, along, with, their, population, is, a, crime, against, god, and, man, himself, it, merits, unequivocal, and, unhesitating, condemnation, anti, war, movements, have, existed, for, every, major, war, in, the, 20th, century, including, most, prominently, world, war, i, world, war, ii, and, the, vietnam, war, in, the, 21st, century, worldwide, anti, war, movements, occurred, in, response, to, the, united, states, invasion, of, afghanistan, and, iraq, protests, opposing, the, war, in, afghanistan, occurred, in, europe, asia, and, the, united, states, during, a, war, brief, pauses, of, violence, may, be, called, for, and, further, agreed, to, ceasefire, temporary, cessation, humanitarian, pauses, and, corridors, days, of, tranquility, de, confliction, arrangements, there, are, a, number, of, disadvantages, obstacles, and, hesitations, against, implementing, such, pauses, such, as, a, humanitarian, corridor, pauses, in, conflict, can, also, be, ill, advised, for, reasons, such, as, delay, of, defeat, and, the, weakening, of, credibility, natural, causes, for, a, pause, may, include, events, such, as, the, 2019, coronavirus, pandemic
