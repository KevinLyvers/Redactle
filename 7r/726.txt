https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shyness
shyness, also, called, diffidence, is, the, feeling, of, apprehension, lack, of, comfort, or, awkwardness, especially, when, a, person, is, around, other, people, this, commonly, occurs, in, new, situations, or, with, unfamiliar, people, a, shy, person, may, simply, opt, to, avoid, these, situations, although, shyness, can, be, a, characteristic, of, people, who, have, low, self, esteem, the, primary, defining, characteristic, of, shyness, is, a, fear, of, what, other, people, will, think, of, a, person, s, behavior, this, fear, of, negative, reactions, such, as, being, mocked, humiliated, or, patronized, criticized, or, rejected, can, cause, a, shy, person, to, retreat, stronger, forms, of, shyness, can, be, referred, to, as, social, anxiety, or, social, phobia, the, initial, cause, of, shyness, varies, scientists, believe, that, they, have, located, genetic, data, supporting, the, hypothesis, that, shyness, is, at, least, partially, genetic, however, there, is, also, evidence, that, suggests, the, environment, in, which, a, person, is, raised, can, also, be, responsible, for, their, shyness, this, includes, child, abuse, particularly, emotional, abuse, such, as, ridicule, shyness, can, originate, after, a, person, has, experienced, a, physical, anxiety, reaction, at, other, times, shyness, seems, to, develop, first, and, then, later, causes, physical, symptoms, of, anxiety, shyness, differs, from, social, anxiety, which, is, a, narrower, often, depression, related, psychological, condition, including, the, experience, of, fear, apprehension, or, worrying, about, being, evaluated, by, others, in, social, situations, to, the, extent, of, inducing, panic, shyness, may, come, from, genetic, traits, the, environment, in, which, a, person, is, raised, and, personal, experiences, shyness, may, be, a, personality, trait, or, can, occur, at, certain, stages, of, development, in, children, shyness, is, often, seen, as, a, hindrance, to, people, and, their, development, the, cause, of, shyness, is, often, disputed, but, it, is, found, that, fear, is, positively, related, to, shyness, suggesting, that, fearful, children, are, much, more, likely, to, develop, being, shy, as, opposed, to, children, less, fearful, shyness, can, also, be, seen, on, a, biological, level, as, a, result, of, an, excess, of, cortisol, when, cortisol, is, present, in, greater, quantities, it, is, known, to, suppress, an, individual, s, immune, system, making, them, more, susceptible, to, illness, and, disease, the, genetics, of, shyness, is, a, relatively, small, area, of, research, that, has, been, receiving, an, even, smaller, amount, of, attention, although, papers, on, the, biological, bases, of, shyness, date, back, to, 1988, some, research, has, indicated, that, shyness, and, aggression, are, related, through, long, and, short, forms, of, the, gene, drd4, though, considerably, more, research, on, this, is, needed, further, it, has, been, suggested, that, shyness, and, social, phobia, the, distinction, between, the, two, is, becoming, ever, more, blurred, are, related, to, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, as, with, other, studies, of, behavioral, genetics, the, study, of, shyness, is, complicated, by, the, number, of, genes, involved, in, and, the, confusion, in, defining, the, phenotype, naming, the, phenotype, and, translation, of, terms, between, genetics, and, psychology, also, causes, problems, several, genetic, links, to, shyness, are, current, areas, of, research, one, is, the, serotonin, transporter, promoter, region, polymorphism, 5, httlpr, the, long, form, of, which, has, been, shown, to, be, modestly, correlated, with, shyness, in, grade, school, children, previous, studies, had, shown, a, connection, between, this, form, of, the, gene, and, both, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, and, autism, mouse, models, have, also, been, used, to, derive, genes, suitable, for, further, study, in, humans, one, such, gene, the, glutamic, acid, decarboxylase, gene, which, encodes, an, enzyme, that, functions, in, gaba, synthesis, has, so, far, been, shown, to, have, some, association, with, behavioral, inhibition, another, gene, the, dopamine, d4, receptor, gene, drd4, exon, iii, polymorphism, had, been, the, subject, of, studies, in, both, shyness, and, aggression, and, is, currently, the, subject, of, studies, on, the, novelty, seeking, trait, a, 1996, study, of, anxiety, related, traits, shyness, being, one, of, these, remarked, that, although, twin, studies, have, indicated, that, individual, variation, in, measures, of, anxiety, related, personality, traits, is, 40, 60, heritable, none, of, the, relevant, genes, has, yet, been, identified, and, that, 10, to, 15, genes, might, be, predicted, to, be, involved, in, the, anxiety, trait, progress, has, been, made, since, then, especially, in, identifying, other, potential, genes, involved, in, personality, traits, but, there, has, been, little, progress, made, towards, confirming, these, relationships, the, long, version, of, the, 5, htt, gene, linked, polymorphic, region, 5, httlpr, is, now, postulated, to, be, correlated, with, shyness, but, in, the, 1996, study, the, short, version, was, shown, to, be, related, to, anxiety, based, traits, thalia, eley, professor, of, developmental, behavioural, genetics, at, king, s, college, london, argues, that, only, about, 30, of, shyness, as, a, trait, is, genetically, inherited, while, the, rest, emerges, as, a, response, to, the, environment, excessive, shyness, embarrassment, self, consciousness, and, timidity, social, phobia, and, lack, of, self, confidence, are, also, components, of, erethism, which, is, a, symptom, complex, that, appears, in, cases, of, mercury, poisoning, the, prevalence, of, shyness, in, some, children, can, be, linked, to, day, length, during, pregnancy, particularly, during, the, midpoint, of, prenatal, development, an, analysis, of, longitudinal, data, from, children, living, at, specific, latitudes, in, the, united, states, and, new, zealand, revealed, a, significant, relationship, between, hours, of, day, length, during, the, midpoint, of, pregnancy, and, the, prevalence, of, shyness, in, children, the, odds, of, being, classified, as, shy, were, 1, 52, times, greater, for, children, exposed, to, shorter, compared, to, longer, daylengths, during, gestation, in, their, analysis, scientists, assigned, conception, dates, to, the, children, relative, to, their, known, birth, dates, which, allowed, them, to, obtain, random, samples, from, children, who, had, a, mid, gestation, point, during, the, longest, hours, of, the, year, and, the, shortest, hours, of, the, year, june, and, december, depending, on, whether, the, cohorts, were, in, the, united, states, or, new, zealand, the, longitudinal, survey, data, included, measurements, of, shyness, on, a, five, point, scale, based, on, interviews, with, the, families, being, surveyed, and, children, in, the, top, 25th, percentile, of, shyness, scores, were, identified, the, data, revealed, a, significant, co, variance, between, the, children, who, presented, as, being, consistently, shy, over, a, two, year, period, and, shorter, day, length, during, their, mid, prenatal, development, period, taken, together, these, estimates, indicate, that, about, one, out, of, five, cases, of, extreme, shyness, in, children, can, be, associated, with, gestation, during, months, of, limited, daylength, in, recent, years, correlations, between, birth, weight, and, shyness, have, been, studied, findings, suggest, that, those, born, at, low, birth, weights, are, more, likely, to, be, shy, risk, aversive, and, cautious, compared, to, those, born, at, normal, birth, weights, these, results, do, not, however, imply, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, shyness, is, most, likely, to, occur, during, unfamiliar, situations, though, in, severe, cases, it, may, hinder, an, individual, in, their, most, familiar, situations, and, relationships, as, well, shy, people, avoid, the, objects, of, their, apprehension, in, order, to, keep, from, feeling, uncomfortable, and, inept, thus, the, situations, remain, unfamiliar, and, the, shyness, perpetuates, itself, shyness, may, fade, with, time, e, g, a, child, who, is, shy, towards, strangers, may, eventually, lose, this, trait, when, older, and, become, more, socially, adept, this, often, occurs, by, adolescence, or, young, adulthood, generally, around, the, age, of, 13, in, some, cases, though, it, may, become, an, integrated, lifelong, character, trait, longitudinal, data, suggests, that, the, three, different, personality, types, evident, in, infancy, easy, slow, to, warm, up, and, difficult, tend, to, change, as, children, mature, extreme, traits, become, less, pronounced, and, personalities, evolve, in, predictable, patterns, over, time, what, has, been, proven, to, remain, constant, is, the, tendency, to, internalize, or, externalize, problems, this, relates, to, individuals, with, shy, personalities, because, they, tend, to, internalize, their, problems, or, dwell, on, their, problems, internally, instead, of, expressing, their, concerns, which, leads, to, disorders, like, depression, and, anxiety, humans, experience, shyness, to, different, degrees, and, in, different, areas, shyness, can, also, be, seen, as, an, academic, determinant, it, has, been, determined, that, there, is, a, negative, relationship, between, shyness, and, classroom, performance, as, the, shyness, of, an, individual, increased, classroom, performance, was, seen, to, decrease, shyness, may, involve, the, discomfort, of, difficulty, in, knowing, what, to, say, in, social, situations, or, may, include, crippling, physical, manifestations, of, uneasiness, shyness, usually, involves, a, combination, of, both, symptoms, and, may, be, quite, devastating, for, the, sufferer, in, many, cases, leading, them, to, feel, that, they, are, boring, or, exhibit, bizarre, behavior, in, an, attempt, to, create, interest, alienating, them, further, behavioral, traits, in, social, situations, such, as, smiling, easily, producing, suitable, conversational, topics, assuming, a, relaxed, posture, and, making, good, eye, contact, may, not, be, second, nature, for, a, shy, person, such, people, might, only, affect, such, traits, by, great, difficulty, or, they, may, even, be, impossible, to, display, those, who, are, shy, are, perceived, more, negatively, in, cultures, that, value, sociability, because, of, the, way, they, act, towards, others, shy, individuals, are, often, distant, during, conversations, which, can, result, in, others, forming, poor, impressions, of, them, and, considering, them, stand, offish, egoist, or, snobbish, people, who, are, not, shy, may, be, up, front, aggressive, or, critical, towards, shy, people, in, an, attempt, to, get, them, out, of, their, shell, even, when, an, attempt, to, draw, out, a, shy, person, is, conducted, in, a, kindly, and, well, intentioned, manner, the, exercise, may, still, backfire, as, by, focusing, attention, on, the, individual, it, increases, their, self, consciousness, and, sense, of, awkwardness, 87, 89, the, term, shyness, may, be, implemented, as, a, lay, blanket, term, for, a, family, of, related, and, partially, overlapping, afflictions, including, timidity, apprehension, in, meeting, new, people, bashfulness, and, diffidence, reluctance, in, asserting, oneself, apprehension, and, anticipation, general, fear, of, potential, interaction, or, intimidation, relating, to, the, object, of, fear, rather, than, one, s, low, confidence, apparent, shyness, as, perceived, by, others, may, simply, be, the, manifestation, of, reservation, or, introversion, a, character, trait, which, causes, an, individual, to, voluntarily, avoid, excessive, social, contact, or, be, terse, in, communication, but, are, not, motivated, or, accompanied, by, discomfort, apprehension, or, lack, of, confidence, introversion, is, commonly, mistaken, for, shyness, however, introversion, is, a, personal, preference, while, shyness, stems, from, distress, rather, according, to, professor, of, psychology, bernardo, j, carducci, introverts, choose, to, avoid, social, situations, because, they, derive, no, reward, from, them, or, may, find, surplus, sensory, input, overwhelming, whereas, shy, people, may, fear, such, situations, research, using, the, statistical, techniques, of, factor, analysis, and, correlation, have, found, shyness, overlaps, mildly, with, both, introversion, and, neuroticism, i, e, negative, emotionality, low, societal, acceptance, of, shyness, or, introversion, may, reinforce, a, shy, or, introverted, individual, s, low, self, confidence, both, shyness, and, introversion, can, outwardly, manifest, with, socially, withdrawn, behaviors, such, as, tendencies, to, avoid, social, situations, especially, when, they, are, unfamiliar, a, variety, of, research, suggests, that, shyness, and, introversion, possess, clearly, distinct, motivational, forces, and, lead, to, uniquely, different, personal, and, peer, reactions, and, therefore, cannot, be, described, as, theoretically, the, same, with, susan, cain, s, quiet, 2012, further, discerning, introversion, as, involving, being, differently, social, preferring, one, on, one, or, small, group, interactions, rather, than, being, anti, social, altogether, research, suggests, that, no, unique, physiological, response, such, as, an, increased, heart, beat, accompanies, socially, withdrawn, behavior, in, familiar, compared, with, unfamiliar, social, situations, but, unsociability, leads, to, decreased, exposure, to, unfamiliar, social, situations, and, shyness, causes, a, lack, of, response, in, such, situations, suggesting, that, shyness, and, unsociability, affect, two, different, aspects, of, sociability, and, are, distinct, personality, traits, in, addition, different, cultures, perceive, unsociability, and, shyness, in, different, ways, leading, to, either, positive, or, negative, individual, feelings, of, self, esteem, collectivist, cultures, view, shyness, as, a, more, positive, trait, related, to, compliance, with, group, ideals, and, self, control, while, perceiving, chosen, isolation, introverted, behavior, negatively, as, a, threat, to, group, harmony, and, because, collectivist, society, accepts, shyness, and, rejects, unsociability, shy, individuals, develop, higher, self, esteem, than, introverted, individuals, on, the, other, hand, individualistic, cultures, perceive, shyness, as, a, weakness, and, a, character, flaw, while, unsociable, personality, traits, preference, to, spend, time, alone, are, accepted, because, they, uphold, the, value, of, autonomy, accordingly, shy, individuals, tend, to, develop, low, self, esteem, in, western, cultures, while, unsociable, individuals, develop, high, self, esteem, an, extreme, case, of, shyness, is, identified, as, a, psychiatric, illness, which, made, its, debut, as, social, phobia, in, dsm, iii, in, 1980, but, was, then, described, as, rare, by, 1994, however, when, dsm, iv, was, published, it, was, given, a, second, alternative, name, in, parentheses, social, anxiety, disorder, and, was, now, said, to, be, relatively, common, affecting, between, 3, and, 13, of, the, population, at, some, point, during, their, lifetime, studies, examining, shy, adolescents, and, university, students, found, that, between, 12, and, 18, of, shy, individuals, meet, criteria, for, social, anxiety, disorder, shyness, affects, people, mildly, in, unfamiliar, social, situations, where, one, feels, anxiety, about, interacting, with, new, people, social, anxiety, disorder, on, the, other, hand, is, a, strong, irrational, fear, of, interacting, with, people, or, being, in, situations, which, may, involve, public, scrutiny, because, one, feels, overly, concerned, about, being, criticized, if, one, embarrasses, oneself, physical, symptoms, of, social, phobia, can, include, blushing, shortness, of, breath, trembling, increased, heart, rate, and, sweating, in, some, cases, these, symptoms, are, intense, enough, and, numerous, enough, to, constitute, a, panic, attack, shyness, on, the, other, hand, may, incorporate, many, of, these, symptoms, but, at, a, lower, intensity, infrequently, and, does, not, interfere, tremendously, with, normal, living, those, considered, shy, are, also, said, to, be, socially, inhibited, social, inhibition, is, the, conscious, or, unconscious, constraint, by, a, person, of, behavior, of, a, social, nature, in, other, words, social, inhibition, is, holding, back, for, social, reasons, there, are, different, levels, of, social, inhibition, from, mild, to, severe, being, socially, inhibited, is, good, when, preventing, one, from, harming, another, and, bad, when, causing, one, to, refrain, from, participating, in, class, discussions, behavioral, inhibition, is, a, temperament, or, personality, style, that, predisposes, a, person, to, become, fearful, distressed, and, withdrawn, in, novel, situations, this, personality, style, is, associated, with, the, development, of, anxiety, disorders, in, adulthood, particularly, social, anxiety, disorder, many, misconceptions, stereotypes, about, shy, individuals, exist, in, western, culture, and, negative, peer, reactions, to, shy, behavior, abound, this, takes, place, because, individualistic, cultures, place, less, value, on, quietness, and, meekness, in, social, situations, and, more, often, reward, outgoing, behaviors, some, misconceptions, include, viewing, introversion, and, social, phobia, synonymous, with, shyness, and, believing, that, shy, people, are, less, intelligent, no, correlation, positive, or, negative, exists, between, intelligence, and, shyness, research, indicates, that, shy, children, have, a, harder, time, expressing, their, knowledge, in, social, situations, which, most, modern, curricula, utilize, and, because, they, do, not, engage, actively, in, discussions, teachers, view, them, as, less, intelligent, in, line, with, social, learning, theory, an, unwillingness, to, engage, with, classmates, and, teachers, makes, it, more, difficult, for, shy, students, to, learn, test, scores, however, indicate, that, whereas, shyness, may, limit, academic, engagement, it, is, unrelated, to, actual, academic, knowledge, depending, on, the, level, of, a, teacher, s, own, shyness, more, indirect, vs, socially, oriented, strategies, may, be, used, with, shy, individuals, to, assess, knowledge, in, the, classroom, and, accommodations, made, observed, peer, evaluations, of, shy, people, during, initial, meeting, and, social, interactions, thereafter, found, that, peers, evaluate, shy, individuals, as, less, intelligent, during, the, first, encounter, during, subsequent, interactions, however, peers, perceived, shy, individuals, intelligence, more, positively, thomas, benton, claims, that, because, shy, people, have, a, tendency, toward, self, criticism, they, are, often, high, achievers, and, not, just, in, solitary, activities, like, research, and, writing, perhaps, even, more, than, the, drive, toward, independent, achievement, shy, people, long, to, make, connections, to, others, often, through, altruistic, behavior, susan, cain, describes, the, benefits, that, shy, people, bring, to, society, that, us, cultural, norms, devalue, without, characteristics, that, shy, people, bring, to, social, interactions, such, as, sensitivity, to, the, emotions, of, others, contemplation, of, ideas, and, valuable, listening, skills, there, would, be, no, balance, to, society, in, earlier, generations, such, as, the, 1950s, society, perceived, shyness, as, a, more, socially, attractive, trait, especially, in, women, indicating, that, views, on, shyness, vary, by, culture, sociologist, susie, scott, challenged, the, interpretation, and, treatment, of, shyness, as, being, pathological, by, treating, shyness, as, an, individual, pathology, we, forget, that, this, is, also, a, socially, oriented, state, of, mind, that, is, socially, produced, and, managed, 2, she, explores, the, idea, that, shyness, is, a, form, of, deviance, a, problem, for, society, as, much, as, for, the, individual, and, concludes, that, to, some, extent, we, are, all, impostors, faking, our, way, through, social, life, 165, 174, one, of, her, interview, subjects, self, defined, as, shy, puts, this, point, of, view, even, more, strongly, sometimes, i, want, to, take, my, cue, from, the, militant, disabled, lobbyists, and, say, hey, it, s, not, my, problem, it, s, society, s, i, want, to, be, proud, to, be, shy, on, the, whole, shys, are, probably, more, sensitive, and, nicer, people, than, normals, i, shouldn, t, have, to, change, society, should, adapt, to, meet, my, needs, 164, in, cultures, that, value, outspokenness, and, overt, confidence, shyness, can, be, perceived, as, weakness, to, an, unsympathetic, observer, a, shy, individual, may, be, mistaken, as, cold, distant, arrogant, or, aloof, which, can, be, frustrating, for, the, shy, individual, however, in, other, cultures, shy, people, may, be, perceived, as, being, thoughtful, intelligent, as, being, good, listeners, and, as, being, more, likely, to, think, before, they, speak, in, cultures, that, value, autonomy, shyness, is, often, analyzed, in, the, context, of, being, a, social, dysfunction, and, is, frequently, contemplated, as, a, personality, disorder, or, mental, health, issue, some, researchers, are, beginning, to, study, comparisons, between, individualistic, and, collectivistic, cultures, to, examine, the, role, that, shyness, might, play, in, matters, of, social, etiquette, and, achieving, group, oriented, goals, shyness, is, one, of, the, emotions, that, may, serve, as, behavioral, regulators, of, social, relationships, in, collectivistic, cultures, for, example, social, shyness, is, evaluated, more, positively, in, a, collectivistic, society, but, negatively, evaluated, in, an, individualistic, society, in, a, cross, cultural, study, of, chinese, and, canadian, school, children, researchers, sought, to, measure, several, variables, related, to, social, reputation, and, peer, relationships, including, shyness, sensitivity, using, peer, nomination, questionnaire, students, evaluated, their, fellow, students, using, positive, and, negative, playmate, nominations, shyness, sensitivity, was, significantly, and, negatively, correlated, with, measures, of, peer, acceptance, in, the, canadian, sample, inconsistent, with, western, results, it, was, found, that, items, describing, shyness, sensitivity, were, separated, from, items, assessing, isolation, in, the, factor, structure, for, the, chinese, sample, shyness, sensitivity, was, positively, associated, with, sociability, leadership, and, with, peer, acceptance, in, the, chinese, sample, in, some, western, cultures, shyness, inhibition, plays, an, important, role, in, psychological, and, social, adjustment, it, has, been, found, that, shyness, inhibition, is, associated, with, a, variety, of, maladaptive, behaviors, being, shy, or, inhibited, in, western, cultures, can, result, in, rejection, by, peers, isolation, and, being, viewed, as, socially, incompetent, by, adults, however, research, suggests, that, if, social, withdrawal, is, seen, as, a, personal, choice, rather, than, the, result, of, shyness, there, are, fewer, negative, connotations, british, writer, arthur, c, benson, felt, shyness, is, not, mere, self, consciousness, but, a, primitive, suspicion, of, strangers, the, primeval, belief, that, their, motives, are, predatory, with, shyness, a, sinister, quality, which, needs, to, be, uprooted, he, believed, the, remedy, is, for, the, shy, to, frequent, society, for, courage, from, familiarity, also, he, claimed, that, too, many, shy, adults, take, refuge, in, a, critical, attitude, engaging, in, brutal, onslaughts, on, inoffensive, persons, he, felt, that, a, better, way, is, for, the, shy, to, be, nice, to, wonder, what, others, need, and, like, interest, in, what, others, do, or, are, talking, about, friendly, questions, and, sympathy, for, charles, darwin, shyness, was, an, odd, state, of, mind, appearing, to, offer, no, benefit, to, our, species, and, since, the, 1970s, the, modern, tendency, in, psychology, has, been, to, see, shyness, as, pathology, however, evolutionary, survival, advantages, of, careful, temperaments, over, adventurous, temperaments, in, dangerous, environments, have, also, been, recognized, in, eastern, cultures, shyness, inhibition, in, school, aged, children, is, seen, as, positive, and, those, that, exhibit, these, traits, are, viewed, well, by, peers, and, are, accepted, they, tend, to, be, seen, as, competent, by, their, teachers, to, perform, well, in, school, and, to, show, well, being, shy, individuals, are, also, more, likely, to, attain, leadership, status, in, school, being, shy, or, inhibited, does, not, correlate, with, loneliness, or, depression, as, in, the, west, in, eastern, cultures, being, shy, and, inhibited, is, perceived, as, a, sign, of, politeness, respectfulness, and, thoughtfulness, in, hispanic, cultures, shyness, and, inhibition, with, authority, figures, is, common, for, instance, hispanic, students, may, feel, shy, towards, being, praised, by, teachers, in, front, of, others, because, in, these, cultures, students, are, rewarded, in, private, with, a, touch, a, smile, or, spoken, word, of, praise, hispanic, students, may, seem, shy, when, they, are, not, it, is, considered, rude, to, excel, over, peers, and, siblings, therefore, it, is, common, for, hispanic, students, to, be, reserved, in, classroom, settings, adults, also, show, reluctance, to, share, personal, matters, about, themselves, to, authority, figures, such, as, nurses, and, doctors, cultures, in, which, the, community, is, closed, and, based, on, agriculture, kenya, india, etc, experience, lower, social, engagement, than, those, in, more, open, communities, united, states, okinawa, etc, where, interactions, with, peers, are, encouraged, children, in, mayan, indian, mexican, and, kenyan, cultures, are, less, expressive, in, social, styles, during, interactions, and, they, spend, little, time, engaged, in, socio, dramatic, activities, they, are, also, less, assertive, in, social, situations, self, expression, and, assertiveness, in, social, interactions, are, related, to, shyness, and, inhibition, in, that, when, one, is, shy, or, inhibited, one, exhibits, little, or, no, expressive, tendencies, assertiveness, is, demonstrated, in, the, same, way, being, shy, and, inhibited, lessen, one, s, chances, of, being, assertive, because, of, a, lack, of, confidence, in, italian, culture, emotional, expressiveness, during, interpersonal, interaction, is, encouraged, from, a, young, age, children, engage, in, debates, or, discussions, that, encourage, and, strengthen, social, assertiveness, independence, and, social, competence, during, childhood, is, also, promoted, being, inhibited, is, looked, down, upon, and, those, who, show, this, characteristic, are, viewed, negatively, by, their, parents, and, peers, like, other, cultures, where, shyness, and, inhibition, is, viewed, negatively, peers, of, shy, and, inhibited, italian, children, reject, the, socially, fearful, cautious, and, withdrawn, these, withdrawn, and, socially, fearful, children, express, loneliness, and, believe, themselves, to, be, lacking, the, social, skills, needed, in, social, interactions, psychological, methods, and, pharmaceutical, drugs, are, commonly,
