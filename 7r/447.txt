following, the, babylonian, exile, when, the, predominant, international, language, in, the, region, was, old, aramaic, hebrew, was, extinct, as, a, colloquial, language, by, late, antiquity, but, it, continued, to, be, used, as, a, literary, language, especially, in, spain, as, the, language, of, commerce, between, jews, of, different, native, languages, and, as, the, liturgical, language, of, judaism, evolving, various, dialects, of, literary, medieval, hebrew, until, its, revival, as, a, spoken, language, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, may, 2023, scott, stripling, published, the, finding, of, what, he, claims, to, be, the, oldest, known, hebrew, inscription, a, curse, tablet, found, at, mount, ebal, dated, from, around, 3200, years, ago, the, presence, of, the, hebrew, name, of, god, yahweh, as, three, letters, yod, heh, vav, yhv, according, to, the, author, and, his, team, meant, that, the, tablet, is, hebrew, and, not, canaanite, however, practically, all, professional, archeologists, and, epigraphers, apart, from, stripling, s, team, claim, that, there, is, no, text, on, this, object, in, july, 2008, israeli, archaeologist, yossi, garfinkel, discovered, a, ceramic, shard, at, khirbet, qeiyafa, that, he, claimed, may, be, the, earliest, hebrew, writing, yet, discovered, dating, from, around, 3, 000, years, ago, hebrew, university, archaeologist, amihai, mazar, said, that, the, inscription, was, proto, canaanite, but, cautioned, that, he, differentiation, between, the, scripts, and, between, the, languages, themselves, in, that, period, remains, unclear, and, suggested, that, calling, the, text, hebrew, might, be, going, too, far, the, gezer, calendar, also, dates, back, to, the, 10th, century, bce, at, the, beginning, of, the, monarchic, period, the, traditional, time, of, the, reign, of, david, and, solomon, classified, as, archaic, biblical, hebrew, the, calendar, presents, a, list, of, seasons, and, related, agricultural, activities, the, gezer, calendar, named, after, the, city, in, whose, proximity, it, was, found, is, written, in, an, old, semitic, script, akin, to, the, phoenician, one, that, through, the, greeks, and, etruscans, later, became, the, latin, alphabet, of, ancient, rome, the, gezer, calendar, is, written, without, any, vowels, and, it, does, not, use, consonants, to, imply, vowels, even, in, the, places, in, which, later, hebrew, spelling, requires, them, numerous, older, tablets, have, been, found, in, the, region, with, similar, scripts, written, in, other, semitic, languages, for, example, proto, sinaitic, it, is, believed, that, the, original, shapes, of, the, script, go, back, to, egyptian, hieroglyphs, though, the, phonetic, values, are, instead, inspired, by, the, acrophonic, principle, the, common, ancestor, of, hebrew, and, phoenician, is, called, canaanite, and, was, the, first, to, use, a, semitic, alphabet, distinct, from, that, of, egyptian, one, ancient, document, is, the, famous, moabite, stone, written, in, the, moabite, dialect, the, siloam, inscription, found, near, jerusalem, is, an, early, example, of, hebrew, less, ancient, samples, of, archaic, hebrew, include, the, ostraca, found, near, lachish, which, describe, events, preceding, the, final, capture, of, jerusalem, by, nebuchadnezzar, and, the, babylonian, captivity, of, 586, bce, in, its, widest, sense, biblical, hebrew, refers, to, the, spoken, language, of, ancient, israel, flourishing, between, c, 1000, bce, and, c, 400, ce, it, comprises, several, evolving, and, overlapping, dialects, the, phases, of, classical, hebrew, are, often, named, after, important, literary, works, associated, with, them, sometimes, the, above, phases, of, spoken, classical, hebrew, are, simplified, into, biblical, hebrew, including, several, dialects, from, the, 10th, century, bce, to, 2nd, century, bce, and, extant, in, certain, dead, sea, scrolls, and, mishnaic, hebrew, including, several, dialects, from, the, 3rd, century, bce, to, the, 3rd, century, ce, and, extant, in, certain, other, dead, sea, scrolls, however, today, most, hebrew, linguists, classify, dead, sea, scroll, hebrew, as, a, set, of, dialects, evolving, out, of, late, biblical, hebrew, and, into, mishnaic, hebrew, thus, including, elements, from, both, but, remaining, distinct, from, either, by, the, start, of, the, byzantine, period, in, the, 4th, century, ce, classical, hebrew, ceased, as, a, regularly, spoken, language, roughly, a, century, after, the, publication, of, the, mishnah, apparently, declining, since, the, aftermath, of, the, catastrophic, bar, kokhba, revolt, around, 135, ce, in, the, early, 6th, century, bce, the, neo, babylonian, empire, conquered, the, ancient, kingdom, of, judah, destroying, much, of, jerusalem, and, exiling, its, population, far, to, the, east, in, babylon, during, the, babylonian, captivity, many, israelites, learned, aramaic, the, closely, related, semitic, language, of, their, captors, thus, for, a, significant, period, the, jewish, elite, became, influenced, by, aramaic, after, cyrus, the, great, conquered, babylon, he, allowed, the, jewish, people, to, return, from, captivity, in, time, a, local, version, of, aramaic, came, to, be, spoken, in, israel, alongside, hebrew, by, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, aramaic, was, the, primary, colloquial, language, of, samarian, babylonian, and, galileean, jews, and, western, and, intellectual, jews, spoke, greek, but, a, form, of, so, called, rabbinic, hebrew, continued, to, be, used, as, a, vernacular, in, judea, until, it, was, displaced, by, aramaic, probably, in, the, 3rd, century, ce, certain, sadducee, pharisee, scribe, hermit, zealot, and, priest, classes, maintained, an, insistence, on, hebrew, and, all, jews, maintained, their, identity, with, hebrew, songs, and, simple, quotations, from, hebrew, texts, while, there, is, no, doubt, that, at, a, certain, point, hebrew, was, displaced, as, the, everyday, spoken, language, of, most, jews, and, that, its, chief, successor, in, the, middle, east, was, the, closely, related, aramaic, language, then, greek, scholarly, opinions, on, the, exact, dating, of, that, shift, have, changed, very, much, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, most, scholars, followed, abraham, geiger, and, gustaf, dalman, in, thinking, that, aramaic, became, a, spoken, language, in, the, land, of, israel, as, early, as, the, beginning, of, israel, s, hellenistic, period, in, the, 4th, century, bce, and, that, as, a, corollary, hebrew, ceased, to, function, as, a, spoken, language, around, the, same, time, moshe, zvi, segal, joseph, klausner, and, ben, yehuda, are, notable, exceptions, to, this, view, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, accumulating, archaeological, evidence, and, especially, linguistic, analysis, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, has, disproven, that, view, the, dead, sea, scrolls, uncovered, in, 1946, 1948, near, qumran, revealed, ancient, jewish, texts, overwhelmingly, in, hebrew, not, aramaic, the, qumran, scrolls, indicate, that, hebrew, texts, were, readily, understandable, to, the, average, jew, and, that, the, language, had, evolved, since, biblical, times, as, spoken, languages, do, recent, scholarship, recognizes, that, reports, of, jews, speaking, in, aramaic, indicate, a, multilingual, society, not, necessarily, the, primary, language, spoken, alongside, aramaic, hebrew, co, existed, within, israel, as, a, spoken, language, most, scholars, now, date, the, demise, of, hebrew, as, a, spoken, language, to, the, end, of, the, roman, period, or, about, 200, ce, it, continued, on, as, a, literary, language, down, through, the, byzantine, period, from, the, 4th, century, ce, the, exact, roles, of, aramaic, and, hebrew, remain, hotly, debated, a, trilingual, scenario, has, been, proposed, for, the, land, of, israel, hebrew, functioned, as, the, local, mother, tongue, with, powerful, ties, to, israel, s, history, origins, and, golden, age, and, as, the, language, of, israel, s, religion, aramaic, functioned, as, the, international, language, with, the, rest, of, the, middle, east, and, eventually, greek, functioned, as, another, international, language, with, the, eastern, areas, of, the, roman, empire, william, schniedewind, argues, that, after, waning, in, the, persian, period, the, religious, importance, of, hebrew, grew, in, the, hellenistic, and, roman, periods, and, cites, epigraphical, evidence, that, hebrew, survived, as, a, vernacular, language, though, both, its, grammar, and, its, writing, system, had, been, substantially, influenced, by, aramaic, according, to, another, summary, greek, was, the, language, of, government, hebrew, the, language, of, prayer, study, and, religious, texts, and, aramaic, was, the, language, of, legal, contracts, and, trade, there, was, also, a, geographic, pattern, according, to, bernard, spolsky, by, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, judeo, aramaic, was, mainly, used, in, galilee, in, the, north, greek, was, concentrated, in, the, former, colonies, and, around, governmental, centers, and, hebrew, monolingualism, continued, mainly, in, the, southern, villages, of, judea, in, other, words, in, terms, of, dialect, geography, at, the, time, of, the, tannaim, palestine, could, be, divided, into, the, aramaic, speaking, regions, of, galilee, and, samaria, and, a, smaller, area, judaea, in, which, rabbinic, hebrew, was, used, among, the, descendants, of, returning, exiles, in, addition, it, has, been, surmised, that, koine, greek, was, the, primary, vehicle, of, communication, in, coastal, cities, and, among, the, upper, class, of, jerusalem, while, aramaic, was, prevalent, in, the, lower, class, of, jerusalem, but, not, in, the, surrounding, countryside, after, the, suppression, of, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, judaeans, were, forced, to, disperse, many, relocated, to, galilee, so, most, remaining, native, speakers, of, hebrew, at, that, last, stage, would, have, been, found, in, the, north, the, christian, new, testament, contains, some, semitic, place, names, and, quotes, the, language, of, such, semitic, glosses, and, in, general, the, language, spoken, by, jews, in, scenes, from, the, new, testament, is, often, referred, to, as, hebrew, in, the, text, although, this, term, is, often, re, interpreted, as, referring, to, aramaic, instead, and, is, rendered, accordingly, in, recent, translations, nonetheless, these, glosses, can, be, interpreted, as, hebrew, as, well, it, has, been, argued, that, hebrew, rather, than, aramaic, or, koine, greek, lay, behind, the, composition, of, the, gospel, of, matthew, see, the, hebrew, gospel, hypothesis, or, language, of, jesus, for, more, details, on, hebrew, and, aramaic, in, the, gospels, the, term, mishnaic, hebrew, generally, refers, to, the, hebrew, dialects, found, in, the, talmud, excepting, quotations, from, the, hebrew, bible, the, dialects, organize, into, mishnaic, hebrew, also, called, tannaitic, hebrew, early, rabbinic, hebrew, or, mishnaic, hebrew, i, which, was, a, spoken, language, and, amoraic, hebrew, also, called, late, rabbinic, hebrew, or, mishnaic, hebrew, ii, which, was, a, literary, language, the, earlier, section, of, the, talmud, is, the, mishnah, that, was, published, around, 200, ce, although, many, of, the, stories, take, place, much, earlier, and, were, written, in, the, earlier, mishnaic, dialect, the, dialect, is, also, found, in, certain, dead, sea, scrolls, mishnaic, hebrew, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, dialects, of, classical, hebrew, that, functioned, as, a, living, language, in, the, land, of, israel, a, transitional, form, of, the, language, occurs, in, the, other, works, of, tannaitic, literature, dating, from, the, century, beginning, with, the, completion, of, the, mishnah, these, include, the, halachic, midrashim, sifra, sifre, mekhilta, etc, and, the, expanded, collection, of, mishnah, related, material, known, as, the, tosefta, the, talmud, contains, excerpts, from, these, works, as, well, as, further, tannaitic, material, not, attested, elsewhere, the, generic, term, for, these, passages, is, baraitot, the, dialect, of, all, these, works, is, very, similar, to, mishnaic, hebrew, about, a, century, after, the, publication, of, the, mishnah, mishnaic, hebrew, fell, into, disuse, as, a, spoken, language, by, the, third, century, ce, sages, could, no, longer, identify, the, hebrew, names, of, many, plants, mentioned, in, the, mishnah, only, a, few, sages, primarily, in, the, southern, regions, retained, the, ability, to, speak, the, language, and, attempted, to, promote, its, use, according, to, the, jerusalem, talmud, megillah, 1, 9, rebbi, jonathan, from, bet, guvrrin, said, four, languages, are, appropriate, that, the, world, should, use, them, and, they, are, these, the, foreign, language, greek, for, song, latin, for, war, syriac, for, elegies, hebrew, for, speech, some, are, saying, also, assyrian, hebrew, script, for, writing, the, later, section, of, the, talmud, the, gemara, generally, comments, on, the, mishnah, and, baraitot, in, two, forms, of, aramaic, nevertheless, hebrew, survived, as, a, liturgical, and, literary, language, in, the, form, of, later, amoraic, hebrew, which, occasionally, appears, in, the, text, of, the, gemara, particularly, in, the, jerusalem, talmud, and, the, classical, aggadah, midrashes, hebrew, was, always, regarded, as, the, language, of, israel, s, religion, history, and, national, pride, and, after, it, faded, as, a, spoken, language, it, continued, to, be, used, as, a, lingua, franca, among, scholars, and, jews, traveling, in, foreign, countries, after, the, 2nd, century, ce, when, the, roman, empire, exiled, most, of, the, jewish, population, of, jerusalem, following, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, they, adapted, to, the, societies, in, which, they, found, themselves, yet, letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry, and, laws, continued, to, be, written, mostly, in, hebrew, which, adapted, by, borrowing, and, inventing, terms, after, the, talmud, various, regional, literary, dialects, of, medieval, hebrew, evolved, the, most, important, is, tiberian, hebrew, or, masoretic, hebrew, a, local, dialect, of, tiberias, in, galilee, that, became, the, standard, for, vocalizing, the, hebrew, bible, and, thus, still, influences, all, other, regional, dialects, of, hebrew, this, tiberian, hebrew, from, the, 7th, to, 10th, century, ce, is, sometimes, called, biblical, hebrew, because, it, is, used, to, pronounce, the, hebrew, bible, however, properly, it, should, be, distinguished, from, the, historical, biblical, hebrew, of, the, 6th, century, bce, whose, original, pronunciation, must, be, reconstructed, tiberian, hebrew, incorporates, the, scholarship, of, the, masoretes, from, masoret, meaning, tradition, who, added, vowel, points, and, grammar, points, to, the, hebrew, letters, to, preserve, much, earlier, features, of, hebrew, for, use, in, chanting, the, hebrew, bible, the, masoretes, inherited, a, biblical, text, whose, letters, were, considered, too, sacred, to, be, altered, so, their, markings, were, in, the, form, of, pointing, in, and, around, the, letters, the, syriac, alphabet, precursor, to, the, arabic, alphabet, also, developed, vowel, pointing, systems, around, this, time, the, aleppo, codex, a, hebrew, bible, with, the, masoretic, pointing, was, written, in, the, 10th, century, likely, in, tiberias, and, survives, into, the, present, day, it, is, perhaps, the, most, important, hebrew, manuscript, in, existence, during, the, golden, age, of, jewish, culture, in, spain, important, work, was, done, by, grammarians, in, explaining, the, grammar, and, vocabulary, of, biblical, hebrew, much, of, this, was, based, on, the, work, of, the, grammarians, of, classical, arabic, important, hebrew, grammarians, were, judah, ben, david, hayyuj, jonah, ibn, janah, abraham, ibn, ezra, and, later, in, provence, david, kimhi, a, great, deal, of, poetry, was, written, by, poets, such, as, dunash, ben, labrat, solomon, ibn, gabirol, judah, ha, levi, moses, ibn, ezra, and, abraham, ibn, ezra, in, a, purified, hebrew, based, on, the, work, of, these, grammarians, and, in, arabic, quantitative, or, strophic, meters, this, literary, hebrew, was, later, used, by, italian, jewish, poets, the, need, to, express, scientific, and, philosophical, concepts, from, classical, greek, and, medieval, arabic, motivated, medieval, hebrew, to, borrow, terminology, and, grammar, from, these, other, languages, or, to, coin, equivalent, terms, from, existing, hebrew, roots, giving, rise, to, a, distinct, style, of, philosophical, hebrew, this, is, used, in, the, translations, made, by, the, ibn, tibbon, family, original, jewish, philosophical, works, were, usually, written, in, arabic, another, important, influence, was, maimonides, who, developed, a, simple, style, based, on, mishnaic, hebrew, for, use, in, his, law, code, the, mishneh, torah, subsequent, rabbinic, literature, is, written, in, a, blend, between, this, style, and, the, aramaized, rabbinic, hebrew, of, the, talmud, hebrew, persevered, through, the, ages, as, the, main, language, for, written, purposes, by, all, jewish, communities, around, the, world, for, a, large, range, of, uses, not, only, liturgy, but, also, poetry, philosophy, science, and, medicine, commerce, daily, correspondence, and, contracts, there, have, been, many, deviations, from, this, generalization, such, as, bar, kokhba, s, letters, to, his, lieutenants, which, were, mostly, in, aramaic, and, maimonides, writings, which, were, mostly, in, arabic, but, overall, hebrew, did, not, cease, to, be, used, for, such, purposes, for, example, the, first, middle, east, printing, press, in, safed, modern, israel, produced, a, small, number, of, books, in, hebrew, in, 1577, which, were, then, sold, to, the, nearby, jewish, world, this, meant, not, only, that, well, educated, jews, in, all, parts, of, the, world, could, correspond, in, a, mutually, intelligible, language, and, that, books, and, legal, documents, published, or, written, in, any, part, of, the, world, could, be, read, by, jews, in, all, other, parts, but, that, an, educated, jew, could, travel, and, converse, with, jews, in, distant, places, just, as, priests, and, other, educated, christians, could, converse, in, latin, for, example, rabbi, avraham, danzig, wrote, the, chayei, adam, in, hebrew, as, opposed, to, yiddish, as, a, guide, to, halacha, for, the, average, 17, year, old, ibid, introduction, 1, similarly, rabbi, yisrael, meir, kagan, s, purpose, in, writing, the, mishnah, berurah, was, to, produce, a, work, that, could, be, studied, daily, so, that, jews, might, know, the, proper, procedures, to, follow, minute, by, minute, the, work, was, nevertheless, written, in, talmudic, hebrew, and, aramaic, since, the, ordinary, jew, of, a, century, ago, was, fluent, enough, in, this, idiom, to, be, able, to, follow, the, mishna, berurah, without, any, trouble, hebrew, has, been, revived, several, times, as, a, literary, language, most, significantly, by, the, haskalah, enlightenment, movement, of, early, and, mid, 19th, century, germany, in, the, early, 19th, century, a, form, of, spoken, hebrew, had, emerged, in, the, markets, of, jerusalem, between, jews, of, different, linguistic, backgrounds, to, communicate, for, commercial, purposes, this, hebrew, dialect, was, to, a, certain, extent, a, pidgin, near, the, end, of, that, century, the, jewish, activist, eliezer, ben, yehuda, owing, to, the, ideology, of, the, national, revival, shivat, tziyon, later, zionism, began, reviving, hebrew, as, a, modern, spoken, language, eventually, as, a, result, of, the, local, movement, he, created, but, more, significantly, as, a, result, of, the, new, groups, of, immigrants, known, under, the, name, of, the, second, aliyah, it, replaced, a, score, of, languages, spoken, by, jews, at, that, time, those, languages, were, jewish, dialects, of, local, languages, including, judaeo, spanish, also, called, judezmo, and, ladino, yiddish, judeo, arabic, and, bukhori, tajiki, or, local, languages, spoken, in, the, jewish, diaspora, such, as, russian, persian, and, arabic, the, major, result, of, the, literary, work, of, the, hebrew, intellectuals, along, the, 19th, century, was, a, lexical, modernization, of, hebrew, new, words, and, expressions, were, adapted, as, neologisms, from, the, large, corpus, of, hebrew, writings, since, the, hebrew, bible, or, borrowed, from, arabic, mainly, by, ben, yehuda, and, older, aramaic, and, latin, many, new, words, were, either, borrowed, from, or, coined, after, european, languages, especially, english, russian, german, and, french, modern, hebrew, became, an, official, language, in, british, ruled, palestine, in, 1921, along, with, english, and, arabic, and, then, in, 1948, became, an, official, language, of, the, newly, declared, state, of, israel, hebrew, is, the, most, widely, spoken, language, in, israel, today, in, the, modern, period, from, the, 19th, century, onward, the, literary, hebrew, tradition, revived, as, the, spoken, language, of, modern, israel, called, variously, israeli, hebrew, modern, israeli, hebrew, modern, hebrew, new, hebrew, israeli, standard, hebrew, standard, hebrew, and, so, on, israeli, hebrew, exhibits, some, features, of, sephardic, hebrew, from, its, local, jerusalemite, tradition, but, adapts, it, with, numerous, neologisms, borrowed, terms, often, technical, from, european, languages, and, adopted, terms, often, colloquial, from, arabic, the, literary, and, narrative, use, of, hebrew, was, revived, beginning, with, the, haskalah, movement, the, first, secular, periodical, in, hebrew, ha, me, assef, the, gatherer, was, published, by, maskilim, in, k, nigsberg, today, s, kaliningrad, from, 1783, onwards, in, the, mid, 19th, century, publications, of, several, eastern, european, hebrew, language, newspapers, e, g, hamagid, founded, in, e, k, in, 1856, multiplied, prominent, poets, were, hayim, nahman, bialik, and, shaul, tchernichovsky, there, were, also, novels, written, in, the, language, the, revival, of, the, hebrew, language, as, a, mother, tongue, was, initiated, in, the, late, 19th, century, by, the, efforts, of, ben, yehuda, he, joined, the, jewish, national, movement, and, in, 1881, immigrated, to, palestine, then, a, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, motivated, by, the, surrounding, ideals, of, renovation, and, rejection, of, the, diaspora, shtetl, lifestyle, ben, yehuda, set, out, to, develop, tools, for, making, the, literary, and, liturgical, language, into, everyday, spoken, language, however, his, brand, of, hebrew, followed, norms, that, had, been, replaced, in, eastern, europe, by, different, grammar, and, style, in, the, writings, of, people, like, ahad, ha, am, and, others, his, organizational, efforts, and, involvement, with, the, establishment, of, schools, and, the, writing, of, textbooks, pushed, the, vernacularization, activity, into, a, gradually, accepted, movement, it, was, not, however, until, the, 1904, 1914, second, aliyah, that, hebrew, had, caught, real, momentum, in, ottoman, palestine, with, the, more, highly, organized, enterprises, set, forth, by, the, new, group, of, immigrants, when, the, british, mandate, of, palestine, recognized, hebrew, as, one, of, the, country, s, three, official, languages, english, arabic, and, hebrew, in, 1922, its, new, formal, status, contributed, to, its, diffusion, a, constructed, modern, language, with, a, truly, semitic, vocabulary, and, written, appearance, although, often, european, in, phonology, was, to, take, its, place, among, the, current, languages, of, the, nations, while, many, saw, his, work, as, fanciful, or, even, blasphemous, because, hebrew, was, the, holy, language, of, the, torah, and, therefore, some, thought, that, it, should, not, be, used, to, discuss, everyday, matters, many, soon, understood, the, need, for, a, common, language, amongst, jews, of, the, british, mandate, who, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, were, arriving, in, large, numbers, from, diverse, countries, and, speaking, different, languages, a, committee, of, the, hebrew, language, was, established, after, the, establishment, of, israel, it, became, the, academy, of, the, hebrew, language, the, results, of, ben, yehuda, s, lexicographical, work, were, published, in, a, dictionary, the, complete, dictionary, of, ancient, and, modern, hebrew, ben, yehuda, dictionary, the, seeds, of, ben, yehuda, s, work, fell, on, fertile, ground, and, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, hebrew, was, well, on, its, way, to, becoming, the, main, language, of, the, jewish, population, of, both, ottoman, and, british, palestine, at, the, time, members, of, the, old, yishuv, and, a, very, few, hasidic, sects, most, notably, those, under, the, auspices, of, satmar, refused, to, speak, hebrew, and, spoke, only, yiddish, in, the, soviet, union, the, use, of, hebrew, along, with, other, jewish, cultural, and, religious, activities, was, suppressed, soviet, authorities, considered, the, use, of, hebrew, reactionary, since, it, was, associated, with, zionism, and, the, teaching, of, hebrew, at, primary, and, secondary, schools, was, officially, banned, by, the, people, s, commissariat, for, education, as, early, as, 1919, as, part, of, an, overall, agenda, aiming, to, secularize, education, the, language, itself, did, not, cease, to, be, studied, at, universities, for, historical, and, linguistic, purposes, the, official, ordinance, stated, that, yiddish, being, the, spoken, language, of, the, russian, jews, should, be, treated, as, their, only, national, language, while, hebrew, was, to, be, treated, as, a, foreign, language, hebrew, books, and, periodicals, ceased, to, be, published, and, were, seized, from, the, libraries, although, liturgical, texts, were, still, published, until, the, 1930s, despite, numerous, protests, a, policy, of, suppression, of, the, teaching, of, hebrew, operated, from, the, 1930s, on, later, in, the, 1980s, in, the, ussr, hebrew, studies, reappeared, due, to, people, struggling, for, permission, to, go, to, israel, refuseniks, several, of, the, teachers, were, imprisoned, e, g, yosef, begun, ephraim, kholmyansky, yevgeny, korostyshevsky, and, others, responsible, for, a, hebrew, learning, network, connecting, many, cities, of, the, ussr, standard, hebrew, as, developed, by, eliezer, ben, yehuda, was, based, on, mishnaic, spelling, and, sephardi, hebrew, pronunciation, however, the, earliest, speakers, of, modern, hebrew, had, yiddish, as, their, native, language, and, often, introduced, calques, from, yiddish, and, phono, semantic, matchings, of, international, words, despite, using, sephardic, hebrew, pronunciation, as, its, primary, basis, modern, israeli, hebrew, has, adapted, to, ashkenazi, hebrew, phonology, in, some, respects, mainly, the, following, the, vocabulary, of, israeli, hebrew, is, much, larger, than, that, of, earlier, periods, according, to, ghil, ad, zuckermann, the, number, of, attested, biblical, hebrew, words, is, 8198, of, which, some, 2000, are, hapax, legomena, the, number, of, biblical, hebrew, roots, on, which, many, of, these, words, are, based, is, 2099, the, number, of, attested, rabbinic, hebrew, words, is, less, than, 20, 000, of, which, i, 7879, are, rabbinic, par, excellence, i, e, they, did, not, appear, in, the, old, testament, the, number, of, new, rabbinic, hebrew, roots, is, 805, ii, around, 6000, are, a, subset, of, biblical, hebrew, and, iii, several, thousand, are, aramaic, words, which, can, have, a, hebrew, form, medieval, hebrew, added, 6421, words, to, modern, hebrew, the, approximate, number, of, new, lexical, items, in, israeli, is, 17, 000, cf, 14, 762, in, even, shoshan, 1970, with, the, inclusion, of, foreign, and, technical, terms, the, total, number, of, israeli, words, including, words, of, biblical, rabbinic, and, medieval, descent, is, more, than, 60, 000, 64, 65, in, israel, modern, hebrew, is, currently, taught, in, institutions, called, ulpanim, singular, ulpan, there, are,

2013, there, are, about, 9, million, hebrew, speakers, worldwide, of, whom, 7, million, speak, it, fluently, currently, 90, of, israeli, jews, are, proficient, in, hebrew, and, 70, are, highly, proficient, some, 60, of, israeli, arabs, are, also, proficient, in, hebrew, and, 30, report, having, a, higher, proficiency, in, hebrew, than, in, arabic, in, total, about, 53, of, the, israeli, population, speaks, hebrew, as, a, native, language, while, most, of, the, rest, speak, it, fluently, in, 2013, hebrew, was, the, native, language, of, 49, of, israelis, over, the, age, of, 20, with, russian, arabic, french, english, yiddish, and, ladino, being, the, native, tongues, of, most, of, the, rest, some, 26, of, immigrants, from, the, former, soviet, union, and, 12, of, arabs, reported, speaking, hebrew, poorly, or, not, at, all, steps, have, been, taken, to, keep, hebrew, the, primary, language, of, use, and, to, prevent, large, scale, incorporation, of, english, words, into, the, hebrew, vocabulary, the, academy, of, the, hebrew, language, of, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, currently, invents, about, 2, 000, new, hebrew, words, each, year, for, modern, words, by, finding, an, original, hebrew, word, that, captures, the, meaning, as, an, alternative, to, incorporating, more, english, words, into, hebrew, vocabulary, the, haifa, municipality, has, banned, officials, from, using, english, words, in, official, documents, and, is, fighting, to, stop, businesses, from, using, only, english, signs, to, market, their, services, in, 2012, a, knesset, bill, for, the, preservation, of, the, hebrew, language, was, proposed, which, includes, the, stipulation, that, all, signage, in, israel, must, first, and, foremost, be, in, hebrew, as, with, all, speeches, by, israeli, officials, abroad, the, bill, s, author, mk, akram, hasson, stated, that, the, bill, was, proposed, as, a, response, to, hebrew, losing, its, prestige, and, children, incorporating, more, english, words, into, their, vocabulary, hebrew, is, one, of, several, languages, for, which, the, constitution, of, south, africa, calls, to, be, respected, in, their, use, for, religious, purposes, also, hebrew, is, an, official, national, minority, language, in, poland, since, 6, january, 2005, hamas, has, made, hebrew, a, compulsory, language, taught, in, schools, in, the, gaza, strip, biblical, hebrew, had, a, typical, semitic, consonant, inventory, with, pharyngeal, a, series, of, emphatic, consonants, possibly, ejective, but, this, is, debated, lateral, fricative, and, in, its, older, stages, also, uvular, merged, into, in, later, biblical, hebrew, and, b, d, k, p, t, underwent, allophonic, spirantization, to, known, as, begadkefat, the, earliest, biblical, hebrew, vowel, system, contained, the, proto, semitic, vowels, a, a, i, i, u, u, as, well, as, o, but, this, system, changed, dramatically, over, time, by, the, time, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, had, shifted, to, s, in, the, jewish, traditions, though, for, the, samaritans, it, merged, with, instead, the, tiberian, reading, tradition, of, the, middle, ages, had, the, vowel, system, a, e, i, o, u, though, other, medieval, reading, traditions, had, fewer, vowels, a, number, of, reading, traditions, have, been, preserved, in, liturgical, use, in, oriental, sephardi, and, mizrahi, jewish, reading, traditions, the, emphatic, consonants, are, realized, as, pharyngealized, while, the, ashkenazi, northern, and, eastern, european, traditions, have, lost, emphatics, and, pharyngeals, although, according, to, ashkenazi, law, pharyngeal, articulation, is, preferred, over, uvular, or, glottal, articulation, when, representing, the, community, in, religious, service, such, as, prayer, and, torah, reading, and, show, the, shift, of, w, to, v, the, samaritan, tradition, has, a, complex, vowel, system, that, does, not, correspond, closely, to, the, tiberian, systems, modern, hebrew, pronunciation, developed, from, a, mixture, of, the, different, jewish, reading, traditions, generally, tending, towards, simplification, in, line, with, sephardi, hebrew, pronunciation, emphatic, consonants, have, shifted, to, their, ordinary, counterparts, w, to, v, and, are, not, present, most, israelis, today, also, merge, with, do, not, have, contrastive, gemination, and, pronounce, r, as, a, uvular, fricative, or, a, voiced, velar, fricative, rather, than, an, alveolar, trill, because, of, ashkenazi, hebrew, influences, the, consonants, t, and, d, have, become, phonemic, due, to, loan, words, and, w, has, similarly, been, re, introduced, notes, hebrew, grammar, is, partly, analytic, expressing, such, forms, as, dative, ablative, and, accusative, using, prepositional, particles, rather, than, grammatical, cases, however, inflection, plays, a, decisive, role, in, the, formation, of, verbs, and, nouns, for, example, nouns, have, a, construct, state, called, smikhut, to, denote, the, relationship, of, belonging, to, this, is, the, converse, of, the, genitive, case, of, more, inflected, languages, words, in, smikhut, are, often, combined, with, hyphens, in, modern, speech, the, use, of, the, construct, is, sometimes, interchangeable, with, the, preposition, shel, meaning, of, there, are, many, cases, however, where, older, declined, forms, are, retained, especially, in, idiomatic, expressions, and, the, like, and, person, enclitics, are, widely, used, to, decline, prepositions, like, all, semitic, languages, the, hebrew, language, exhibits, a, pattern, of, stems, consisting, typically, of, triliteral, or, 3, consonant, consonantal, roots, from, which, nouns, adjectives, and, verbs, are, formed, in, various, ways, e, g, by, inserting, vowels, doubling, consonants, lengthening, vowels, and, or, adding, prefixes, suffixes, or, infixes, 4, consonant, roots, also, exist, and, became, more, frequent, in, the, modern, language, due, to, a, process, of, coining, verbs, from, nouns, that, are, themselves, constructed, from, 3, consonant, verbs, some, triliteral, roots, lose, one, of, their, consonants, in, most, forms, and, are, called, nakhim, resting, hebrew, uses, a, number, of, one, letter, prefixes, that, are, added, to, words, for, various, purposes, these, are, called, inseparable, prepositions, or, letters, of, use, hebrew, romanized, otiyot, hashimush, such, items, include, the, definite, article, ha, ha, the, prepositions, be, be, in, le, le, to, a, shortened, version, of, the, preposition, el, mi, mi, from, a, shortened, version, of, the, preposition, min, conjunctions, ve, ve, and, she, e, that, a, shortened, version, of, the, biblical, conjunction, asher, ke, ke, as, like, a, shortened, version, of, the, conjunction, kmo, the, vowel, accompanying, each, of, these, letters, may, differ, from, those, listed, above, depending, on, the, first, letter, or, vowel, following, it, the, rules, governing, these, changes, are, hardly, observed, in, colloquial, speech, as, most, speakers, tend, to, employ, the, regular, form, however, they, may, be, heard, in, more, formal, circumstances, for, example, if, a, preposition, is, put, before, a, word, that, begins, with, a, moving, shva, then, the, preposition, takes, the, vowel, i, and, the, initial, consonant, may, be, weakened, colloquial, be, kfar, in, a, village, corresponds, to, the, more, formal, bi, khfar, the, definite, article, may, be, inserted, between, a, preposition, or, a, conjunction, and, the, word, it, refers, to, creating, composite, words, like, m, ha, kfar, from, the, village, the, latter, also, demonstrates, the, change, in, the, vowel, of, mi, with, be, le, and, ke, the, definite, article, is, assimilated, into, the, prefix, which, then, becomes, ba, la, or, ka, thus, be, ha, matos, becomes, ba, matos, in, the, plane, this, does, not, happen, to, m, the, form, of, min, or, mi, used, before, the, letter, he, therefore, m, ha, matos, is, a, valid, form, which, means, from, the, airplane, like, most, other, languages, the, vocabulary, of, the, hebrew, language, is, divided, into, verbs, nouns, adjectives, and, so, on, and, its, sentence, structure, can, be, analyzed, by, terms, like, object, subject, and, so, on, users, of, the, language, write, modern, hebrew, from, right, to, left, using, the, hebrew, alphabet, an, impure, abjad, or, consonant, only, script, of, 22, letters, the, ancient, paleo, hebrew, alphabet, resembles, those, used, for, canaanite, and, phoenician, modern, scripts, derive, from, the, square, letter, form, known, as, ashurit, assyrian, which, developed, from, the, aramaic, script, a, cursive, hebrew, script, is, used, in, handwriting, the, letters, tend, to, appear, more, circular, in, form, when, written, in, cursive, and, sometimes, vary, markedly, from, their, printed, equivalents, the, medieval, version, of, the, cursive, script, forms, the, basis, of, another, style, known, as, rashi, script, when, necessary, vowels, are, indicated, by, diacritic, marks, above, or, below, the, letter, representing, the, syllabic, onset, or, by, use, of, matres, lectionis, which, are, consonantal, letters, used, as, vowels, further, diacritics, may, serve, to, indicate, variations, in, the, pronunciation, of, the, consonants, e, g, bet, vet, shin, sin, and, in, some, contexts, to, indicate, the, punctuation, accentuation, and, musical, rendition, of, biblical, texts, see, hebrew, cantillation, hebrew, has, always, been, used, as, the, language, of, prayer, and, study, and, the, following, pronunciation, systems, are, found, ashkenazi, hebrew, originating, in, central, and, eastern, europe, is, still, widely, used, in, ashkenazi, jewish, religious, services, and, studies, in, israel, and, abroad, particularly, in, the, haredi, and, other, orthodox, communities, it, was, influenced, by, yiddish, pronunciation, sephardi, hebrew, is, the, traditional, pronunciation, of, the, spanish, and, portuguese, jews, and, sephardi, jews, in, the, countries, of, the, former, ottoman, empire, with, the, exception, of, yemenite, hebrew, this, pronunciation, in, the, form, used, by, the, jerusalem, sephardic, community, is, the, basis, of, the, hebrew, phonology, of, israeli, native, speakers, it, was, influenced, by, ladino, pronunciation, mizrahi, oriental, hebrew, is, actually, a, collection, of, dialects, spoken, liturgically, by, jews, in, various, parts, of, the, arab, and, islamic, world, it, was, derived, from, the, old, arabic, language, and, in, some, cases, influenced, by, sephardi, hebrew, yemenite, hebrew, or, temanit, differs, from, other, mizrahi, dialects, by, having, a, radically, different, vowel, system, and, distinguishing, between, different, diacritically, marked, consonants, that, are, pronounced, identically, in, other, dialects, for, example, gimel, and, ghimel, these, pronunciations, are, still, used, in, synagogue, ritual, and, religious, study, in, israel, and, elsewhere, mostly, by, people, who, are, not, native, speakers, of, hebrew, however, some, traditionalist, israelis, use, liturgical, pronunciations, in, prayer, many, synagogues, in, the, diaspora, even, though, ashkenazi, by, rite, and, by, ethnic, composition, have, adopted, the, sephardic, pronunciation, in, deference, to, israeli, hebrew, however, in, many, british, and, american, schools, and, synagogues, this, pronunciation, retains, several, elements, of, its, ashkenazi, substrate, especially, the, distinction, between, tsere, and, segol
