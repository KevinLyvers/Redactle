culture, k, l, t, r, kul, ch, r, is, a, concept, that, encompasses, the, social, behavior, institutions, and, norms, found, in, human, societies, as, well, as, the, knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and, habits, of, the, individuals, in, these, groups, culture, is, often, originated, from, or, attributed, to, a, specific, region, or, location, humans, acquire, culture, through, the, learning, processes, of, enculturation, and, socialization, which, is, shown, by, the, diversity, of, cultures, across, societies, a, cultural, norm, codifies, acceptable, conduct, in, society, it, serves, as, a, guideline, for, behavior, dress, language, and, demeanor, in, a, situation, which, serves, as, a, template, for, expectations, in, a, social, group, accepting, only, a, monoculture, in, a, social, group, can, bear, risks, just, as, a, single, species, can, wither, in, the, face, of, environmental, change, for, lack, of, functional, responses, to, the, change, thus, in, military, culture, valor, is, counted, a, typical, behavior, for, an, individual, and, duty, honor, and, loyalty, to, the, social, group, are, counted, as, virtues, or, functional, responses, in, the, continuum, of, conflict, in, the, practice, of, religion, analogous, attributes, can, be, identified, in, a, social, group, cultural, change, or, repositioning, is, the, reconstruction, of, a, cultural, concept, of, a, society, cultures, are, internally, affected, by, both, forces, encouraging, change, and, forces, resisting, change, cultures, are, externally, affected, via, contact, between, societies, organizations, like, unesco, attempt, to, preserve, culture, and, cultural, heritage, culture, is, considered, a, central, concept, in, anthropology, encompassing, the, range, of, phenomena, that, are, transmitted, through, social, learning, in, human, societies, cultural, universals, are, found, in, all, human, societies, these, include, expressive, forms, like, art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and, technologies, like, tool, usage, cooking, shelter, and, clothing, the, concept, of, material, culture, covers, the, physical, expressions, of, culture, such, as, technology, architecture, and, art, whereas, the, immaterial, aspects, of, culture, such, as, principles, of, social, organization, including, practices, of, political, organization, and, social, institutions, mythology, philosophy, literature, both, written, and, oral, and, science, comprise, the, intangible, cultural, heritage, of, a, society, in, the, humanities, one, sense, of, culture, as, an, attribute, of, the, individual, has, been, the, degree, to, which, they, have, cultivated, a, particular, level, of, sophistication, in, the, arts, sciences, education, or, manners, the, level, of, cultural, sophistication, has, also, sometimes, been, used, to, distinguish, civilizations, from, less, complex, societies, such, hierarchical, perspectives, on, culture, are, also, found, in, class, based, distinctions, between, a, high, culture, of, the, social, elite, and, a, low, culture, popular, culture, or, folk, culture, of, the, lower, classes, distinguished, by, the, stratified, access, to, cultural, capital, in, common, parlance, culture, is, often, used, to, refer, specifically, to, the, symbolic, markers, used, by, ethnic, groups, to, distinguish, themselves, visibly, from, each, other, such, as, body, modification, clothing, or, jewelry, mass, culture, refers, to, the, mass, produced, and, mass, mediated, forms, of, consumer, culture, that, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, some, schools, of, philosophy, such, as, marxism, and, critical, theory, have, argued, that, culture, is, often, used, politically, as, a, tool, of, the, elites, to, manipulate, the, proletariat, and, create, a, false, consciousness, such, perspectives, are, common, in, the, discipline, of, cultural, studies, in, the, wider, social, sciences, the, theoretical, perspective, of, cultural, materialism, holds, that, human, symbolic, culture, arises, from, the, material, conditions, of, human, life, as, humans, create, the, conditions, for, physical, survival, and, that, the, basis, of, culture, is, found, in, evolved, biological, dispositions, when, used, as, a, count, noun, a, culture, is, the, set, of, customs, traditions, and, values, of, a, society, or, community, such, as, an, ethnic, group, or, nation, culture, is, the, set, of, knowledge, acquired, over, time, in, this, sense, multiculturalism, values, the, peaceful, coexistence, and, mutual, respect, between, different, cultures, inhabiting, the, same, planet, sometimes, culture, is, also, used, to, describe, specific, practices, within, a, subgroup, of, a, society, a, subculture, e, g, bro, culture, or, a, counterculture, within, cultural, anthropology, the, ideology, and, analytical, stance, of, cultural, relativism, hold, that, cultures, cannot, easily, be, objectively, ranked, or, evaluated, because, any, evaluation, is, necessarily, situated, within, the, value, system, of, a, given, culture, the, modern, term, culture, is, based, on, a, term, used, by, the, ancient, roman, orator, cicero, in, his, tusculanae, disputationes, where, he, wrote, of, a, cultivation, of, the, soul, or, cultura, animi, using, an, agricultural, metaphor, for, the, development, of, a, philosophical, soul, understood, teleologically, as, the, highest, possible, ideal, for, human, development, samuel, pufendorf, took, over, this, metaphor, in, a, modern, context, meaning, something, similar, but, no, longer, assuming, that, philosophy, was, man, s, natural, perfection, his, use, and, that, of, many, writers, after, him, refers, to, all, the, ways, in, which, human, beings, overcome, their, original, barbarism, and, through, artifice, become, fully, human, in, 1986, philosopher, edward, s, casey, wrote, the, very, word, culture, meant, place, tilled, in, middle, english, and, the, same, word, goes, back, to, latin, colere, to, inhabit, care, for, till, worship, and, cultus, a, cult, especially, a, religious, one, to, be, cultural, to, have, a, culture, is, to, inhabit, a, place, sufficiently, intensely, to, cultivate, it, to, be, responsible, for, it, to, respond, to, it, to, attend, to, it, caringly, culture, described, by, richard, velkley, originally, meant, the, cultivation, of, the, soul, or, mind, acquires, most, of, its, later, modern, meaning, in, the, writings, of, the, 18th, century, german, thinkers, who, were, on, various, levels, developing, rousseau, s, criticism, of, modern, liberalism, and, enlightenment, thus, a, contrast, between, culture, and, civilization, is, usually, implied, in, these, authors, even, when, not, expressed, as, such, in, the, words, of, anthropologist, e, b, tylor, it, is, that, complex, whole, which, includes, knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and, any, other, capabilities, and, habits, acquired, by, man, as, a, member, of, society, alternatively, in, a, contemporary, variant, culture, is, defined, as, a, social, domain, that, emphasizes, the, practices, discourses, and, material, expressions, which, over, time, express, the, continuities, and, discontinuities, of, social, meaning, of, a, life, held, in, common, the, cambridge, english, dictionary, states, that, culture, is, the, way, of, life, especially, the, general, customs, and, beliefs, of, a, particular, group, of, people, at, a, particular, time, terror, management, theory, posits, that, culture, is, a, series, of, activities, and, worldviews, that, provide, humans, with, the, basis, for, perceiving, themselves, as, person, of, worth, within, the, world, of, meaning, raising, themselves, above, the, merely, physical, aspects, of, existence, in, order, to, deny, the, animal, insignificance, and, death, that, homo, sapiens, became, aware, of, when, they, acquired, a, larger, brain, the, word, is, used, in, a, general, sense, as, the, evolved, ability, to, categorize, and, represent, experiences, with, symbols, and, to, act, imaginatively, and, creatively, this, ability, arose, with, the, evolution, of, behavioral, modernity, in, humans, around, 50, 000, years, ago, and, is, often, thought, to, be, unique, to, humans, however, some, other, species, have, demonstrated, similar, though, much, less, complicated, abilities, for, social, learning, it, is, also, used, to, denote, the, complex, networks, of, practices, and, accumulated, knowledge, and, ideas, that, are, transmitted, through, social, interaction, and, exist, in, specific, human, groups, or, cultures, using, the, plural, form, raimon, panikkar, identified, 29, ways, in, which, cultural, change, can, be, brought, about, including, growth, development, evolution, involution, renovation, reconception, reform, innovation, revivalism, revolution, mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis, borrowing, eclecticism, syncretism, modernization, indigenization, and, transformation, in, this, context, modernization, could, be, viewed, as, adoption, of, enlightenment, era, beliefs, and, practices, such, as, science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and, the, notion, of, progress, rein, raud, building, on, the, work, of, umberto, eco, pierre, bourdieu, and, jeffrey, c, alexander, has, proposed, a, model, of, cultural, change, based, on, claims, and, bids, which, are, judged, by, their, cognitive, adequacy, and, endorsed, or, not, endorsed, by, the, symbolic, authority, of, the, cultural, community, in, question, cultural, invention, has, come, to, mean, any, innovation, that, is, new, and, found, to, be, useful, to, a, group, of, people, and, expressed, in, their, behavior, but, which, does, not, exist, as, a, physical, object, humanity, is, in, a, global, accelerating, culture, change, period, driven, by, the, expansion, of, international, commerce, the, mass, media, and, above, all, the, human, population, explosion, among, other, factors, culture, repositioning, means, the, reconstruction, of, the, cultural, concept, of, a, society, cultures, are, internally, affected, by, both, forces, encouraging, change, and, forces, resisting, change, these, forces, are, related, to, both, social, structures, and, natural, events, and, are, involved, in, the, perpetuation, of, cultural, ideas, and, practices, within, current, structures, which, themselves, are, subject, to, change, social, conflict, and, the, development, of, technologies, can, produce, changes, within, a, society, by, altering, social, dynamics, and, promoting, new, cultural, models, and, spurring, or, enabling, generative, action, these, social, shifts, may, accompany, ideological, shifts, and, other, types, of, cultural, change, for, example, the, u, s, feminist, movement, involved, new, practices, that, produced, a, shift, in, gender, relations, altering, both, gender, and, economic, structures, environmental, conditions, may, also, enter, as, factors, for, example, after, tropical, forests, returned, at, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, plants, suitable, for, domestication, were, available, leading, to, the, invention, of, agriculture, which, in, turn, brought, about, many, cultural, innovations, and, shifts, in, social, dynamics, cultures, are, externally, affected, via, contact, between, societies, which, may, also, produce, or, inhibit, social, shifts, and, changes, in, cultural, practices, war, or, competition, over, resources, may, impact, technological, development, or, social, dynamics, additionally, cultural, ideas, may, transfer, from, one, society, to, another, through, diffusion, or, acculturation, in, diffusion, the, form, of, something, though, not, necessarily, its, meaning, moves, from, one, culture, to, another, for, example, western, restaurant, chains, and, culinary, brands, sparked, curiosity, and, fascination, to, the, chinese, as, china, opened, its, economy, to, international, trade, in, the, late, 20th, century, stimulus, diffusion, the, sharing, of, ideas, refers, to, an, element, of, one, culture, leading, to, an, invention, or, propagation, in, another, direct, borrowing, on, the, other, hand, tends, to, refer, to, technological, or, tangible, diffusion, from, one, culture, to, another, diffusion, of, innovations, theory, presents, a, research, based, model, of, why, and, when, individuals, and, cultures, adopt, new, ideas, practices, and, products, acculturation, has, different, meanings, still, in, this, context, it, refers, to, the, replacement, of, traits, of, one, culture, with, another, such, as, what, happened, to, certain, native, american, tribes, and, many, indigenous, peoples, across, the, globe, during, the, process, of, colonization, related, processes, on, an, individual, level, include, assimilation, adoption, of, a, different, culture, by, an, individual, and, transculturation, the, transnational, flow, of, culture, has, played, a, major, role, in, merging, different, cultures, and, sharing, thoughts, ideas, and, beliefs, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, formulated, an, individualist, definition, of, enlightenment, similar, to, the, concept, of, bildung, enlightenment, is, man, s, emergence, from, his, self, incurred, immaturity, he, argued, that, this, immaturity, comes, not, from, a, lack, of, understanding, but, from, a, lack, of, courage, to, think, independently, against, this, intellectual, cowardice, kant, urged, sapere, aude, dare, to, be, wise, in, reaction, to, kant, german, scholars, such, as, johann, gottfried, herder, 1744, 1803, argued, that, human, creativity, which, necessarily, takes, unpredictable, and, highly, diverse, forms, is, as, important, as, human, rationality, moreover, herder, proposed, a, collective, form, of, bildung, for, herder, bildung, was, the, totality, of, experiences, that, provide, a, coherent, identity, and, sense, of, common, destiny, to, a, people, in, 1795, the, prussian, linguist, and, philosopher, wilhelm, von, humboldt, 1767, 1835, called, for, an, anthropology, that, would, synthesize, kant, s, and, herder, s, interests, during, the, romantic, era, scholars, in, germany, especially, those, concerned, with, nationalist, movements, such, as, the, nationalist, struggle, to, create, a, germany, out, of, diverse, principalities, and, the, nationalist, struggles, by, ethnic, minorities, against, the, austro, hungarian, empire, developed, a, more, inclusive, notion, of, culture, as, worldview, weltanschauung, according, to, this, school, of, thought, each, ethnic, group, has, a, distinct, worldview, that, is, incommensurable, with, the, worldviews, of, other, groups, although, more, inclusive, than, earlier, views, this, approach, to, culture, still, allowed, for, distinctions, between, civilized, and, primitive, or, tribal, cultures, in, 1860, adolf, bastian, 1826, 1905, argued, for, the, psychic, unity, of, mankind, he, proposed, that, a, scientific, comparison, of, all, human, societies, would, reveal, that, distinct, worldviews, consisted, of, the, same, basic, elements, according, to, bastian, all, human, societies, share, a, set, of, elementary, ideas, elementargedanken, different, cultures, or, different, folk, ideas, v, lkergedanken, are, local, modifications, of, the, elementary, ideas, this, view, paved, the, way, for, the, modern, understanding, of, culture, franz, boas, 1858, 1942, was, trained, in, this, tradition, and, he, brought, it, with, him, when, he, left, germany, for, the, united, states, in, the, 19th, century, humanists, such, as, english, poet, and, essayist, matthew, arnold, 1822, 1888, used, the, word, culture, to, refer, to, an, ideal, of, individual, human, refinement, of, the, best, that, has, been, thought, and, said, in, the, world, this, concept, of, culture, is, also, comparable, to, the, german, concept, of, bildung, culture, being, a, pursuit, of, our, total, perfection, by, means, of, getting, to, know, on, all, the, matters, which, most, concern, us, the, best, which, has, been, thought, and, said, in, the, world, in, practice, culture, referred, to, an, elite, ideal, and, was, associated, with, such, activities, as, art, classical, music, and, haute, cuisine, as, these, forms, were, associated, with, urban, life, culture, was, identified, with, civilization, from, latin, civitas, lit, city, another, facet, of, the, romantic, movement, was, an, interest, in, folklore, which, led, to, identifying, a, culture, among, non, elites, this, distinction, is, often, characterized, as, that, between, high, culture, namely, that, of, the, ruling, social, group, and, low, culture, in, other, words, the, idea, of, culture, that, developed, in, europe, during, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, reflected, inequalities, within, european, societies, matthew, arnold, contrasted, culture, with, anarchy, other, europeans, following, philosophers, thomas, hobbes, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, contrasted, culture, with, the, state, of, nature, according, to, hobbes, and, rousseau, the, native, americans, who, were, being, conquered, by, europeans, from, the, 16th, centuries, on, were, living, in, a, state, of, nature, this, opposition, was, expressed, through, the, contrast, between, civilized, and, uncivilized, according, to, this, way, of, thinking, one, could, classify, some, countries, and, nations, as, more, civilized, than, others, and, some, people, as, more, cultured, than, others, this, contrast, led, to, herbert, spencer, s, theory, of, social, darwinism, and, lewis, henry, morgan, s, theory, of, cultural, evolution, just, as, some, critics, have, argued, that, the, distinction, between, high, and, low, cultures, is, an, expression, of, the, conflict, between, european, elites, and, non, elites, other, critics, have, argued, that, the, distinction, between, civilized, and, uncivilized, people, is, an, expression, of, the, conflict, between, european, colonial, powers, and, their, colonial, subjects, other, 19th, century, critics, following, rousseau, have, accepted, this, differentiation, between, higher, and, lower, culture, but, have, seen, the, refinement, and, sophistication, of, high, culture, as, corrupting, and, unnatural, developments, that, obscure, and, distort, people, s, essential, nature, these, critics, considered, folk, music, as, produced, by, the, folk, i, e, rural, illiterate, peasants, to, honestly, express, a, natural, way, of, life, while, classical, music, seemed, superficial, and, decadent, equally, this, view, often, portrayed, indigenous, peoples, as, noble, savages, living, authentic, and, unblemished, lives, uncomplicated, and, uncorrupted, by, the, highly, stratified, capitalist, systems, of, the, west, in, 1870, the, anthropologist, edward, tylor, 1832, 1917, applied, these, ideas, of, higher, versus, lower, culture, to, propose, a, theory, of, the, evolution, of, religion, according, to, this, theory, religion, evolves, from, more, polytheistic, to, more, monotheistic, forms, in, the, process, he, redefined, culture, as, a, diverse, set, of, activities, characteristic, of, all, human, societies, this, view, paved, the, way, for, the, modern, understanding, of, religion, although, anthropologists, worldwide, refer, to, tylor, s, definition, of, culture, in, the, 20th, century, culture, emerged, as, the, central, and, unifying, concept, of, american, anthropology, where, it, most, commonly, refers, to, the, universal, human, capacity, to, classify, and, encode, human, experiences, symbolically, and, to, communicate, symbolically, encoded, experiences, socially, american, anthropology, is, organized, into, four, fields, each, of, which, plays, an, important, role, in, research, on, culture, biological, anthropology, linguistic, anthropology, cultural, anthropology, and, in, the, united, states, and, canada, archaeology, the, term, kulturbrille, or, culture, glasses, coined, by, german, american, anthropologist, franz, boas, refers, to, the, lenses, through, which, a, person, sees, their, own, culture, martin, lindstrom, asserts, that, kulturbrille, which, allow, a, person, to, make, sense, of, the, culture, they, inhabit, can, blind, us, to, things, outsiders, pick, up, immediately, the, sociology, of, culture, concerns, culture, as, manifested, in, society, for, sociologist, georg, simmel, 1858, 1918, culture, referred, to, the, cultivation, of, individuals, through, the, agency, of, external, forms, which, have, been, objectified, in, the, course, of, history, as, such, culture, in, the, sociological, field, can, be, defined, as, the, ways, of, thinking, the, ways, of, acting, and, the, material, objects, that, together, shape, a, people, s, way, of, life, culture, can, be, either, of, two, types, non, material, culture, or, material, culture, non, material, culture, refers, to, the, non, physical, ideas, that, individuals, have, about, their, culture, including, values, belief, systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and, institutions, while, material, culture, is, the, physical, evidence, of, a, culture, in, the, objects, and, architecture, they, make, or, have, made, the, term, tends, to, be, relevant, only, in, archeological, and, anthropological, studies, but, it, specifically, means, all, material, evidence, which, can, be, attributed, to, culture, past, or, present, cultural, sociology, first, emerged, in, weimar, germany, 1918, 1933, where, sociologists, such, as, alfred, weber, used, the, term, kultursoziologie, cultural, sociology, cultural, sociology, was, then, reinvented, in, the, english, speaking, world, as, a, product, of, the, cultural, turn, of, the, 1960s, which, ushered, in, structuralist, and, postmodern, approaches, to, social, science, this, type, of, cultural, sociology, may, be, loosely, regarded, as, an, approach, incorporating, cultural, analysis, and, critical, theory, cultural, sociologists, tend, to, reject, scientific, methods, instead, hermeneutically, focusing, on, words, artifacts, and, symbols, culture, has, since, become, an, important, concept, across, many, branches, of, sociology, including, resolutely, scientific, fields, like, social, stratification, and, social, network, analysis, as, a, result, there, has, been, a, recent, influx, of, quantitative, sociologists, to, the, field, thus, there, is, now, a, growing, group, of, sociologists, of, culture, who, are, confusingly, not, cultural, sociologists, these, scholars, reject, the, abstracted, postmodern, aspects, of, cultural, sociology, and, instead, look, for, a, theoretical, backing, in, the, more, scientific, vein, of, social, psychology, and, cognitive, science, the, sociology, of, culture, grew, from, the, intersection, between, sociology, as, shaped, by, early, theorists, like, marx, durkheim, and, weber, with, the, growing, discipline, of, anthropology, wherein, researchers, pioneered, ethnographic, strategies, for, describing, and, analyzing, a, variety, of, cultures, around, the, world, part, of, the, legacy, of, the, early, development, of, the, field, lingers, in, the, methods, much, of, cultural, sociological, research, is, qualitative, in, the, theories, a, variety, of, critical, approaches, to, sociology, are, central, to, current, research, communities, and, in, the, substantive, focus, of, the, field, for, instance, relationships, between, popular, culture, political, control, and, social, class, were, early, and, lasting, concerns, in, the, field, in, the, united, kingdom, sociologists, and, other, scholars, influenced, by, marxism, such, as, stuart, hall, 1932, 2014, and, raymond, williams, 1921, 1988, developed, cultural, studies, following, nineteenth, century, romantics, they, identified, culture, with, consumption, goods, and, leisure, activities, such, as, art, music, film, food, sports, and, clothing, they, saw, patterns, of, consumption, and, leisure, as, determined, by, relations, of, production, which, led, them, to, focus, on, class, relations, and, the, organization, of, production, in, the, united, kingdom, cultural, studies, focuses, largely, on, the, study, of, popular, culture, that, is, on, the, social, meanings, of, mass, produced, consumer, and, leisure, goods, richard, hoggart, coined, the, term, in, 1964, when, he, founded, the, birmingham, centre, for, contemporary, cultural, studies, or, cccs, it, has, since, become, strongly, associated, with, stuart, hall, who, succeeded, hoggart, as, director, cultural, studies, in, this, sense, then, can, be, viewed, as, a, limited, concentration, scoped, on, the, intricacies, of, consumerism, which, belongs, to, a, wider, culture, sometimes, referred, to, as, western, civilization, or, globalism, from, the, 1970s, onward, stuart, hall, s, pioneering, work, along, with, that, of, his, colleagues, paul, willis, dick, hebdige, tony, jefferson, and, angela, mcrobbie, created, an, international, intellectual, movement, as, the, field, developed, it, began, to, combine, political, economy, communication, sociology, social, theory, literary, theory, media, theory, film, video, studies, cultural, anthropology, philosophy, museum, studies, and, art, history, to, study, cultural, phenomena, or, cultural, texts, in, this, field, researchers, often, concentrate, on, how, particular, phenomena, relate, to, matters, of, ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social, class, and, or, gender, cultural, studies, is, concerned, with, the, meaning, and, practices, of, everyday, life, these, practices, comprise, the, ways, people, do, particular, things, such, as, watching, television, or, eating, out, in, a, given, culture, it, also, studies, the, meanings, and, uses, people, attribute, to, various, objects, and, practices, specifically, culture, involves, those, meanings, and, practices, held, independently, of, reason, watching, television, to, view, a, public, perspective, on, a, historical, event, should, not, be, thought, of, as, culture, unless, referring, to, the, medium, of, television, itself, which, may, have, been, selected, culturally, however, schoolchildren, watching, television, after, school, with, their, friends, to, fit, in, certainly, qualifies, since, there, is, no, grounded, reason, for, one, s, participation, in, this, practice, in, the, context, of, cultural, studies, a, text, includes, not, only, written, language, but, also, films, photographs, fashion, or, hairstyles, the, texts, of, cultural, studies, comprise, all, the, meaningful, artifacts, of, culture, similarly, the, discipline, widens, the, concept, of, culture, culture, for, a, cultural, studies, researcher, not, only, includes, traditional, high, culture, the, culture, of, ruling, social, groups, and, popular, culture, but, also, everyday, meanings, and, practices, the, last, two, in, fact, have, become, the, main, focus, of, cultural, studies, a, further, and, recent, approach, is, comparative, cultural, studies, based, on, the, disciplines, of, comparative, literature, and, cultural, studies, scholars, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, developed, somewhat, different, versions, of, cultural, studies, after, the, late, 1970s, the, british, version, of, cultural, studies, had, originated, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, mainly, under, the, influence, of, richard, hoggart, e, p, thompson, and, raymond, williams, and, later, that, of, stuart, hall, and, others, at, the, centre, for, contemporary, cultural, studies, at, the, university, of, birmingham, this, included, overtly, political, left, wing, views, and, criticisms, of, popular, culture, as, capitalist, mass, culture, it, absorbed, some, of, the, ideas, of, the, frankfurt, school, critique, of, the, culture, industry, i, e, mass, culture, this, emerges, in, the, writings, of, early, british, cultural, studies, scholars, and, their, influences, see, the, work, of, for, example, raymond, williams, stuart, hall, paul, willis, and, paul, gilroy, in, the, united, states, lindlof, and, taylor, write, cultural, studies, grounded, in, a, pragmatic, liberal, pluralist, tradition, the, american, version, of, cultural, studies, initially, concerned, itself, more, with, understanding, the, subjective, and, appropriative, side, of, audience, reactions, to, and, uses, of, mass, culture, for, example, american, cultural, studies, advocates, wrote, about, the, liberatory, aspects, of, fandom, the, distinction, between, american, and, british, strands, however, has, faded, some, researchers, especially, in, early, british, cultural, studies, apply, a, marxist, model, to, the, field, this, strain, of, thinking, has, some, influence, from, the, frankfurt, school, but, especially, from, the, structuralist, marxism, of, louis, althusser, and, others, the, main, focus, of, an, orthodox, marxist, approach, concentrates, on, the, production, of, meaning, this, model, assumes, a, mass, production, of, culture, and, identifies, power, as, residing, with, those, producing, cultural, artifacts, in, a, marxist, view, the, mode, and, relations, of, production, form, the, economic, base, of, society, which, constantly, interacts, and, influences, superstructures, such, as, culture, other, approaches, to, cultural, studies, such, as, feminist, cultural, studies, and, later, american, developments, of, the, field, distance, themselves, from, this, view, they, criticize, the, marxist, assumption, of, a, single, dominant, meaning, shared, by, all, for, any, cultural, product, the, non, marxist, approaches, suggest, that, different, ways, of, consuming, cultural, artifacts, affect, the, meaning, of, the, product, this, view, comes, through, in, the, book, doing, cultural, studies, the, story, of, the, sony, walkman, by, paul, du, gay, et, al, which, seeks, to, challenge, the, notion, that, those, who, produce, commodities, control, the, meanings, that, people, attribute, to, them, feminist, cultural, analyst, theorist, and, art, historian, griselda, pollock, contributed, to, cultural, studies, from, viewpoints, of, art, history, and, psychoanalysis, the, writer, julia, kristeva, is, among, influential, voices, at, the, turn, of, the, century, contributing, to, cultural, studies, from, the, field, of, art, and, psychoanalytical, french, feminism, petrakis, and, kostis, 2013, divide, cultural, background, variables, into, two, main, groups, in, 2016, a, new, approach, to, culture, was, suggested, by, rein, raud, who, defines, culture, as, the, sum, of, resources, available, to, human, beings, for, making, sense, of, their, world, and, proposes, a, two, tiered, approach, combining, the, study, of, texts, all, reified, meanings, in, circulation, and, cultural, practices, all, repeatable, actions, that, involve, the, production, dissemination, or, transmission, of, purposes, thus, making, it, possible, to, re, link, anthropological, and, sociological, study, of, culture, with, the, tradition, of, textual, theory, starting, in, the, 1990s, 31, psychological, research, on, culture, influence, began, to, grow, and, challenge, the, universality, assumed, in, general, psychology, 158, 168, culture, psychologists, began, to, try, to, explore, the, relationship, between, emotions, and, culture, and, answer, whether, the, human, mind, is, independent, from, culture, for, example, people, from, collectivistic, cultures, such, as, the, japanese, suppress, their, positive, emotions, more, than, their, american, counterparts, culture, may, affect, the, way, that, people, experience, and, express, emotions, on, the, other, hand, some, researchers, try, to, look, for, differences, between, people, s, personalities, across, cultures, as, different, cultures, dictate, distinctive, norms, culture, shock, is, also, studied, to, understand, how, people, react, when, they, are, confronted, with, other, cultures, lgbt, culture, is, displayed, with, significantly, different, levels, of, tolerance, within, different, cultures, and, nations, cognitive, tools, may, not, be, accessible, or, they, may, function, differently, cross, culture, 19, for, example, people, who, are, raised, in, a, culture, with, an, abacus, are, trained, with, distinctive, reasoning, style, cultural, lenses, may, also, make, people, view, the, same, outcome, of, events, differently, westerners, are, more, motivated, by, their, successes, than, their, failures, while, east, asians, are, better, motivated, by, the, avoidance, of, failure, culture, is, important, for, psychologists, to, consider, when, understanding, the, human, mental, operation, the, notion, of, the, anxious, unstable, and, rebellious, adolescent, has, been, criticized, by, experts, such, as, robert, epstein, who, state, that, an, undeveloped, brain, is, not, the, main, cause, of, teenagers, turmoils, some, have, criticized, this, understanding, of, adolescence, classifying, it, as, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, in, human, history, created, by, modern, society, and, have, been, highly, critical, of, what, they, view, as, the, infantilization, of, young, adults, in, american, society, according, to, robert, epstein, and, jennifer, american, style, teen, turmoil, is, absent, in, more, than, 100, cultures, around, the, world, suggesting, that, such, mayhem, is, not, biologically, inevitable, second, the, brain, itself, changes, in, response, to, experiences, raising, the, question, of, whether, adolescent, brain, characteristics, are, the, cause, of, teen, tumult, or, rather, the, result, of, lifestyle, and, experiences, david, moshman, has, also, stated, in, regards, to, adolescence, that, brain, research, is, crucial, for, a, full, picture, but, it, does, not, provide, an, ultimate, explanation, there, are, a, number, of, international, agreements, and, national, laws, relating, to, the, protection, of, cultural, heritage, and, cultural, diversity, unesco, and, its, partner, organizations, such, as, blue, shield, international, coordinate, international, protection, and, local, implementation, the, hague, convention, for, the, protection, of, cultural, property, in, the, event, of, armed, conflict, and, the, unesco, convention, on, the, protection, and, promotion, of, the, diversity, of, cultural, expressions, deal, with, the, protection, of, culture, article, 27, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, deals, with, cultural, heritage, in, two, ways, it, gives, people, the, right, to, participate, in, cultural, life, on, the, one, hand, and, the, right, to, the, protection, of, their, contributions, to, cultural, life, on, the, other, in, the, 21st, century, the, protection, of, culture, has, been, the, focus, of, increasing, activity, by, national, and, international, organizations, the, un, and, unesco, promote, cultural, preservation, and, cultural, diversity, through, declarations, and, legally, binding, conventions, or, treaties, the, aim, is, not, to, protect, a, person, s, property, but, rather, to, preserve, the, cultural, heritage, of, humanity, especially, in, the, event, of, war, and, armed, conflict, according, to, karl, von, habsburg, president, of, blue, shield, international, the, destruction, of, cultural, assets, is, also, part, of, psychological, warfare, the, target, of, the, attack, is, the, identity, of, the, opponent, which, is, why, symbolic, cultural, assets, become, a, main, target, it, is, also, intended, to, affect, the, particularly, sensitive, cultural, memory, the, growing, cultural, diversity, and, the, economic, basis, such, as, tourism, of, a, state, region, or, municipality, tourism, is, having, an, increasing, impact, on, the, various, forms, of, culture, on, the, one, hand, this, can, be, physical, impact, on, individual, objects, or, the, destruction, caused, by, increasing, environmental, pollution, and, on, the, other, hand, socio, cultural, effects, on, society
