clinical, psychology, is, an, integration, of, human, science, behavioral, science, theory, and, clinical, knowledge, for, the, purpose, of, understanding, preventing, and, relieving, psychologically, based, distress, or, dysfunction, and, to, promote, subjective, well, being, and, personal, development, central, to, its, practice, are, psychological, assessment, clinical, formulation, and, psychotherapy, although, clinical, psychologists, also, engage, in, research, teaching, consultation, forensic, testimony, and, program, development, and, administration, in, many, countries, clinical, psychology, is, a, regulated, mental, health, profession, the, field, is, generally, considered, to, have, begun, in, 1896, with, the, opening, of, the, first, psychological, clinic, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, by, lightner, witmer, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, clinical, psychology, was, focused, on, psychological, assessment, with, little, attention, given, to, treatment, this, changed, after, the, 1940s, when, world, war, ii, resulted, in, the, need, for, a, large, increase, in, the, number, of, trained, clinicians, since, that, time, three, main, educational, models, have, developed, in, the, us, the, phd, clinical, science, model, heavily, focused, on, research, the, phd, science, practitioner, model, integrating, scientific, research, and, practice, and, the, psyd, practitioner, scholar, model, focusing, on, clinical, theory, and, practice, in, the, uk, and, the, republic, of, ireland, the, clinical, psychology, doctorate, falls, between, the, latter, two, of, these, models, whilst, in, much, of, mainland, europe, the, training, is, at, the, master, s, level, and, predominantly, psychotherapeutic, clinical, psychologists, are, expert, in, providing, psychotherapy, and, generally, train, within, four, primary, theoretical, orientations, psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, and, systems, or, family, therapy, the, earliest, recorded, approaches, to, assess, and, treat, mental, distress, were, a, combination, of, religious, magical, and, or, medical, perspectives, in, the, early, 19th, century, one, approach, to, study, mental, conditions, and, behavior, was, using, phrenology, the, study, of, personality, by, examining, the, shape, of, the, skull, other, popular, treatments, at, that, time, included, the, study, of, the, shape, of, the, face, physiognomy, and, mesmer, s, treatment, for, mental, conditions, using, magnets, mesmerism, spiritualism, and, phineas, quimby, s, mental, healing, were, also, popular, while, the, scientific, community, eventually, came, to, reject, all, of, these, methods, for, treating, mental, illness, academic, psychologists, also, were, not, concerned, with, serious, forms, of, mental, illness, the, study, of, mental, illness, was, already, being, done, in, the, developing, fields, of, psychiatry, and, neurology, within, the, asylum, movement, it, was, not, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, around, the, time, when, sigmund, freud, was, first, developing, his, talking, cure, in, vienna, that, the, first, scientific, application, of, clinical, psychology, began, by, the, second, half, of, the, 1800s, the, scientific, study, of, psychology, was, becoming, well, established, in, university, laboratories, although, there, were, a, few, scattered, voices, calling, for, applied, psychology, the, general, field, looked, down, upon, this, idea, and, insisted, on, pure, science, as, the, only, respectable, practice, this, changed, when, lightner, witmer, 1867, 1956, a, past, student, of, wundt, and, head, of, the, psychology, department, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, agreed, to, treat, a, young, boy, who, had, trouble, with, spelling, his, successful, treatment, was, soon, to, lead, to, witmer, s, opening, of, the, first, psychological, clinic, at, penn, in, 1896, dedicated, to, helping, children, with, learning, disabilities, ten, years, later, in, 1907, witmer, was, to, found, the, first, journal, of, this, new, field, the, psychological, clinic, where, he, coined, the, term, clinical, psychology, defined, as, the, study, of, individuals, by, observation, or, experimentation, with, the, intention, of, promoting, change, the, field, was, slow, to, follow, witmer, s, example, but, by, 1914, there, were, 26, similar, clinics, in, the, us, even, as, clinical, psychology, was, growing, working, with, issues, of, serious, mental, distress, remained, the, domain, of, psychiatrists, and, neurologists, however, clinical, psychologists, continued, to, make, inroads, into, this, area, due, to, their, increasing, skill, at, psychological, assessment, psychologists, reputation, as, assessment, experts, became, solidified, during, world, war, i, with, the, development, of, two, intelligence, tests, army, alpha, and, army, beta, testing, verbal, and, nonverbal, skills, respectively, which, could, be, used, with, large, groups, of, recruits, due, in, large, part, to, the, success, of, these, tests, assessment, was, to, become, the, core, discipline, of, clinical, psychology, for, the, next, quarter, century, when, another, war, would, propel, the, field, into, treatment, the, field, began, to, organize, under, the, name, clinical, psychology, in, 1917, with, the, founding, of, the, american, association, of, clinical, psychology, this, only, lasted, until, 1919, after, which, the, american, psychological, association, founded, by, g, stanley, hall, in, 1892, developed, a, section, on, clinical, psychology, which, offered, certification, until, 1927, growth, in, the, field, was, slow, for, the, next, few, years, when, various, unconnected, psychological, organizations, came, together, as, the, american, association, of, applied, psychology, in, 1930, which, would, act, as, the, primary, forum, for, psychologists, until, after, world, war, ii, when, the, apa, reorganized, in, 1945, the, apa, created, what, is, now, called, division, 12, the, society, for, clinical, psychology, which, remains, a, leading, organization, in, the, field, psychological, societies, and, associations, in, other, english, speaking, countries, developed, similar, divisions, including, in, britain, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, when, world, war, ii, broke, out, the, military, once, again, called, upon, clinical, psychologists, as, soldiers, began, to, return, from, combat, psychologists, started, to, notice, symptoms, of, psychological, trauma, labeled, shell, shock, eventually, to, be, termed, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, that, were, best, treated, as, soon, as, possible, because, physicians, including, psychiatrists, were, over, extended, in, treating, bodily, injuries, psychologists, were, called, to, help, treat, this, condition, at, the, same, time, female, psychologists, who, were, excluded, from, the, war, effort, formed, the, national, council, of, women, psychologists, with, the, purpose, of, helping, communities, deal, with, the, stresses, of, war, and, giving, young, mothers, advice, on, child, rearing, after, the, war, the, veterans, administration, in, the, us, made, an, enormous, investment, to, set, up, programs, to, train, doctoral, level, clinical, psychologists, to, help, treat, the, thousands, of, veterans, needing, care, as, a, consequence, the, us, went, from, having, no, formal, university, programs, in, clinical, psychology, in, 1946, to, over, half, of, all, phds, in, psychology, in, 1950, being, awarded, in, clinical, psychology, wwii, helped, bring, dramatic, changes, to, clinical, psychology, not, just, in, america, but, internationally, as, well, graduate, education, in, psychology, began, adding, psychotherapy, to, the, science, and, research, focus, based, on, the, 1947, scientist, practitioner, model, known, today, as, the, boulder, model, for, phd, programs, in, clinical, psychology, clinical, psychology, in, britain, developed, much, like, in, the, us, after, wwii, specifically, within, the, context, of, the, national, health, service, with, qualifications, standards, and, salaries, managed, by, the, british, psychological, society, by, the, 1960s, psychotherapy, had, become, embedded, within, clinical, psychology, but, for, many, the, phd, educational, model, did, not, offer, the, necessary, training, for, those, interested, in, practice, rather, than, research, there, was, a, growing, argument, that, said, the, field, of, psychology, in, the, us, had, developed, to, a, degree, warranting, explicit, training, in, clinical, practice, the, concept, of, a, practice, oriented, degree, was, debated, in, 1965, and, narrowly, gained, approval, for, a, pilot, program, at, the, university, of, illinois, starting, in, 1968, several, other, similar, programs, were, instituted, soon, after, and, in, 1973, at, the, vail, conference, on, professional, training, in, psychology, the, practitioner, scholar, model, of, clinical, psychology, or, vail, model, resulting, in, the, doctor, of, psychology, psyd, degree, was, recognized, although, training, would, continue, to, include, research, skills, and, a, scientific, understanding, of, psychology, the, intent, would, be, to, produce, highly, trained, professionals, similar, to, programs, in, medicine, dentistry, and, law, the, first, program, explicitly, based, on, the, psyd, model, was, instituted, at, rutgers, university, today, about, half, of, all, american, graduate, students, in, clinical, psychology, are, enrolled, in, psyd, programs, since, the, 1970s, clinical, psychology, has, continued, growing, into, a, robust, profession, and, academic, field, of, study, although, the, exact, number, of, practicing, clinical, psychologists, is, unknown, it, is, estimated, that, between, 1974, and, 1990, the, number, in, the, us, grew, from, 20, 000, to, 63, 000, clinical, psychologists, continue, to, be, experts, in, assessment, and, psychotherapy, while, expanding, their, focus, to, address, issues, of, gerontology, sports, and, the, criminal, justice, system, to, name, a, few, one, important, field, is, health, psychology, the, fastest, growing, employment, setting, for, clinical, psychologists, in, the, past, decade, other, major, changes, include, the, impact, of, managed, care, on, mental, health, care, an, increasing, realization, of, the, importance, of, knowledge, relating, to, multicultural, and, diverse, populations, and, emerging, privileges, to, prescribe, psychotropic, medication, or, clinical, psychologists, engage, in, a, wide, range, of, activities, some, focus, solely, on, research, into, the, assessment, treatment, or, cause, of, mental, illness, and, related, conditions, some, teach, whether, in, a, medical, school, or, hospital, setting, or, in, an, academic, department, e, g, psychology, department, at, an, institution, of, higher, education, the, majority, of, clinical, psychologists, engage, in, some, form, of, clinical, practice, with, professional, services, including, psychological, assessment, provision, of, psychotherapy, development, and, administration, of, clinical, programs, and, forensics, e, g, providing, expert, testimony, in, a, legal, proceeding, in, clinical, practice, clinical, psychologists, may, work, with, individuals, couples, families, or, groups, in, a, variety, of, settings, including, private, practices, hospitals, mental, health, organizations, schools, businesses, and, non, profit, agencies, clinical, psychologists, who, provide, clinical, services, may, also, choose, to, specialize, some, specializations, are, codified, and, credentialed, by, regulatory, agencies, within, the, country, of, practice, in, the, united, states, such, specializations, are, credentialed, by, the, american, board, of, professional, psychology, abpp, clinical, psychologists, study, a, generalist, program, in, psychology, plus, postgraduate, training, and, or, clinical, placement, and, supervision, the, length, of, training, differs, across, the, world, ranging, from, four, years, plus, post, bachelors, supervised, practice, to, a, doctorate, of, three, to, six, years, which, combines, clinical, placement, the, practice, of, clinical, psychology, requires, a, license, in, the, united, states, canada, the, united, kingdom, and, many, other, countries, in, the, us, about, half, of, all, clinical, psychology, graduate, students, are, being, trained, in, phd, programs, a, model, that, emphasizes, research, with, the, other, half, in, psyd, programs, which, has, more, focus, on, practice, similar, to, professional, degrees, for, medicine, and, law, both, models, are, accredited, by, the, american, psychological, association, and, many, other, english, speaking, psychological, societies, a, smaller, number, of, schools, offer, accredited, programs, in, clinical, psychology, resulting, in, a, master, s, degree, which, usually, takes, two, to, three, years, post, bachelors, although, each, of, the, us, states, is, somewhat, different, in, terms, of, requirements, and, licenses, there, are, three, common, elements, all, u, s, state, and, canadian, province, licensing, boards, are, members, of, the, association, of, state, and, provincial, psychology, boards, asppb, which, created, and, maintains, the, examination, for, professional, practice, in, psychology, eppp, many, states, require, other, examinations, in, addition, to, the, eppp, such, as, a, jurisprudence, i, e, mental, health, law, examination, and, or, an, oral, examination, most, states, also, require, a, certain, number, of, continuing, education, credits, per, year, in, order, to, renew, a, license, which, can, be, obtained, through, various, means, such, as, taking, audited, classes, and, attending, approved, workshops, clinical, psychologists, require, the, psychologist, license, to, practice, although, other, mental, health, provider, licenses, can, be, obtained, with, a, master, s, degree, such, as, marriage, and, family, therapist, mft, licensed, professional, counselor, lpc, and, licensed, psychological, associate, lpa, in, the, uk, clinical, psychologists, undertake, a, doctor, of, clinical, psychology, dclinpsych, which, is, a, practitioner, doctorate, with, both, clinical, and, research, components, this, is, a, three, year, full, time, salaried, program, sponsored, by, the, national, health, service, nhs, and, based, in, universities, and, the, nhs, entry, into, these, programs, is, highly, competitive, and, requires, at, least, a, three, year, undergraduate, degree, in, psychology, plus, some, form, of, experience, usually, in, either, the, nhs, as, an, assistant, psychologist, or, in, academia, as, a, research, assistant, it, is, not, unusual, for, applicants, to, apply, several, times, before, being, accepted, onto, a, training, course, as, only, about, one, fifth, of, applicants, are, accepted, each, year, these, clinical, psychology, doctoral, degrees, are, accredited, by, the, british, psychological, society, and, the, health, professions, council, hpc, the, hpc, is, the, statutory, regulator, for, practitioner, psychologists, in, the, uk, those, who, successfully, complete, clinical, psychology, doctoral, degrees, are, eligible, to, apply, for, registration, with, the, hpc, as, a, clinical, psychologist, in, the, uk, registration, as, a, clinical, psychologist, with, the, health, professions, council, hpc, is, necessary, the, hpc, is, the, statutory, regulator, for, practitioner, psychologists, in, the, uk, in, the, uk, the, following, titles, are, restricted, by, law, registered, psychologist, and, practitioner, psychologist, in, addition, the, specialist, title, clinical, psychologist, is, also, restricted, by, law, in, india, training, is, through, the, m, phil, clinical, psychology, psyd, and, professional, diploma, in, clinical, psychology, an, important, area, of, expertise, for, many, clinical, psychologists, is, psychological, assessment, and, there, are, indications, that, as, many, as, 91, of, psychologists, engage, in, this, core, clinical, practice, assessment, methods, include, standardized, psychometric, tests, semi, structured, diagnostic, interviews, record, review, collateral, interviews, and, behavioral, observation, psychological, measures, generally, fall, within, one, of, several, categories, including, the, following, after, assessment, clinical, psychologists, may, provide, a, diagnosis, many, countries, use, the, international, statistical, classification, of, diseases, and, related, health, problems, icd, 10, while, the, us, most, often, uses, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, both, are, nosological, systems, that, largely, assume, categorical, disorders, diagnosed, through, the, application, of, sets, of, criteria, including, symptoms, and, signs, several, new, models, are, being, discussed, including, a, dimensional, model, based, on, empirically, validated, models, of, human, differences, such, as, the, five, factor, model, of, personality, and, a, psychosocial, model, which, would, take, changing, intersubjective, states, into, greater, account, the, proponents, of, these, models, claim, that, they, would, offer, greater, diagnostic, flexibility, and, clinical, utility, without, depending, on, the, medical, concept, of, illness, however, they, also, admit, that, these, models, are, not, yet, robust, enough, to, gain, widespread, use, and, should, continue, to, be, developed, clinical, assessment, can, be, characterized, as, a, prediction, problem, where, the, purpose, of, assessment, is, to, make, inferences, predictions, about, past, present, or, future, behavior, for, example, many, therapy, decisions, are, made, on, the, basis, of, what, a, clinician, expects, will, help, a, patient, make, therapeutic, gains, once, observations, have, been, collected, e, g, psychological, testing, results, diagnostic, impressions, clinical, history, x, ray, etc, there, are, two, mutually, exclusive, ways, to, combine, those, sources, of, information, to, arrive, at, a, decision, diagnosis, or, prediction, one, way, is, to, combine, the, data, in, an, algorithmic, or, mechanical, fashion, mechanical, prediction, methods, are, simply, a, mode, of, combination, of, data, to, arrive, at, a, decision, prediction, of, behavior, e, g, treatment, response, the, mechanical, prediction, does, not, preclude, any, type, of, data, from, being, combined, it, can, incorporate, clinical, judgments, properly, coded, in, the, algorithm, the, defining, characteristic, is, that, once, the, data, to, be, combined, is, given, the, mechanical, approach, will, make, a, prediction, that, is, 100, reliable, that, is, it, will, make, exactly, the, same, prediction, for, exactly, the, same, data, every, time, clinical, prediction, on, the, other, hand, does, not, guarantee, this, as, it, depends, on, the, decision, making, processes, of, the, clinician, making, the, judgment, their, current, state, of, mind, and, knowledge, base, what, has, come, to, be, called, the, clinical, versus, statistical, prediction, debate, was, first, described, in, detail, in, 1954, by, paul, meehl, where, he, explored, the, claim, that, mechanical, formal, algorithmic, methods, of, data, combination, could, outperform, clinical, e, g, subjective, informal, in, the, clinician, s, head, methods, when, such, combinations, are, used, to, arrive, at, a, prediction, of, behavior, meehl, concluded, that, mechanical, modes, of, combination, performed, as, well, or, better, than, clinical, modes, subsequent, meta, analyses, of, studies, that, directly, compare, mechanical, and, clinical, predictions, have, born, out, meehl, s, 1954, conclusions, a, 2009, survey, of, practicing, clinical, psychologists, found, that, clinicians, almost, exclusively, use, their, clinical, judgment, to, make, behavioral, predictions, for, their, patients, including, diagnosis, and, prognosis, psychotherapy, involves, a, formal, relationship, between, professional, and, client, usually, an, individual, couple, family, or, small, group, that, employs, a, set, of, procedures, intended, to, form, a, therapeutic, alliance, explore, the, nature, of, psychological, problems, and, encourage, new, ways, of, thinking, feeling, or, behaving, clinicians, have, a, wide, range, of, individual, interventions, to, draw, from, often, guided, by, their, training, for, example, a, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, clinician, might, use, worksheets, to, record, distressing, cognitions, a, psychoanalyst, might, encourage, free, association, while, a, psychologist, trained, in, gestalt, techniques, might, focus, on, immediate, interactions, between, client, and, therapist, clinical, psychologists, generally, seek, to, base, their, work, on, research, evidence, and, outcome, studies, as, well, as, on, trained, clinical, judgment, although, there, are, literally, dozens, of, recognized, therapeutic, orientations, their, differences, can, often, be, categorized, on, two, dimensions, insight, vs, action, and, in, session, vs, out, session, the, methods, used, are, also, different, in, regards, to, the, population, being, served, as, well, as, the, context, and, nature, of, the, problem, therapy, will, look, very, different, between, say, a, traumatized, child, a, depressed, but, high, functioning, adult, a, group, of, people, recovering, from, substance, dependence, and, a, ward, of, the, state, suffering, from, terrifying, delusions, other, elements, that, play, a, critical, role, in, the, process, of, psychotherapy, include, the, environment, culture, age, cognitive, functioning, motivation, and, duration, i, e, brief, or, long, term, therapy, many, clinical, psychologists, are, integrative, or, eclectic, and, draw, from, the, evidence, base, across, different, models, of, therapy, in, an, integrative, way, rather, than, using, a, single, specific, model, in, the, uk, clinical, psychologists, have, to, show, competence, in, at, least, two, models, of, therapy, including, cbt, to, gain, their, doctorate, the, british, psychological, society, division, of, clinical, psychology, has, been, vocal, about, the, need, to, follow, the, evidence, base, rather, than, being, wedded, to, a, single, model, of, therapy, in, the, us, intervention, applications, and, research, are, dominated, in, training, and, practice, by, essentially, four, major, schools, of, practice, psychodynamic, humanism, behavioral, cognitive, behavioral, and, systems, or, family, therapy, the, psychodynamic, perspective, developed, out, of, the, psychoanalysis, of, sigmund, freud, the, core, object, of, psychoanalysis, is, to, make, the, unconscious, conscious, to, make, the, client, aware, of, his, or, her, own, primal, drives, namely, those, relating, to, sex, and, aggression, and, the, various, defenses, used, to, keep, them, in, check, the, essential, tools, of, the, psychoanalytic, process, are, the, use, of, free, association, and, an, examination, of, the, client, s, transference, towards, the, therapist, defined, as, the, tendency, to, take, unconscious, thoughts, or, emotions, about, a, significant, person, e, g, a, parent, and, transfer, them, onto, another, person, major, variations, on, freudian, psychoanalysis, practiced, today, include, self, psychology, ego, psychology, and, object, relations, theory, these, general, orientations, now, fall, under, the, umbrella, term, psychodynamic, psychology, with, common, themes, including, examination, of, transference, and, defenses, an, appreciation, of, the, power, of, the, unconscious, and, a, focus, on, how, early, developments, in, childhood, have, shaped, the, client, s, current, psychological, state, humanistic, psychology, was, developed, in, the, 1950s, in, reaction, to, both, behaviorism, and, psychoanalysis, largely, due, to, the, person, centered, therapy, of, carl, rogers, often, referred, to, as, rogerian, therapy, and, existential, psychology, developed, by, viktor, frankl, and, rollo, may, rogers, believed, that, a, client, needed, only, three, things, from, a, clinician, to, experience, therapeutic, improvement, congruence, unconditional, positive, regard, and, empathetic, understanding, by, using, phenomenology, intersubjectivity, and, first, person, categories, the, humanistic, approach, seeks, to, get, a, glimpse, of, the, whole, person, and, not, just, the, fragmented, parts, of, the, personality, this, aspect, of, holism, links, up, with, another, common, aim, of, humanistic, practice, in, clinical, psychology, which, is, to, seek, an, integration, of, the, whole, person, also, called, self, actualization, from, 1980, hans, werner, gessmann, integrated, the, ideas, of, humanistic, psychology, into, group, psychotherapy, as, humanistic, psychodrama, according, to, humanistic, thinking, each, individual, person, already, has, inbuilt, potentials, and, resources, that, might, help, them, to, build, a, stronger, personality, and, self, concept, the, mission, of, the, humanistic, psychologist, is, to, help, the, individual, employ, these, resources, via, the, therapeutic, relationship, emotion, focused, therapy, emotionally, focused, therapy, eft, not, to, be, confused, with, emotional, freedom, techniques, was, initially, informed, by, humanistic, phenomenological, and, gestalt, theories, of, therapy, emotion, focused, therapy, can, be, defined, as, the, practice, of, therapy, informed, by, an, understanding, of, the, role, of, emotion, in, psychotherapeutic, change, eft, is, founded, on, a, close, and, careful, analysis, of, the, meanings, and, contributions, of, emotion, to, human, experience, and, change, in, psychotherapy, this, focus, leads, therapist, and, client, toward, strategies, that, promotes, the, awareness, acceptance, expression, utilization, regulation, and, transformation, of, emotion, as, well, as, corrective, emotional, experience, with, the, therapist, the, goals, of, eft, are, strengthening, the, self, regulating, affect, and, creating, new, meaning, similarly, to, some, psychodynamic, therapy, approaches, eft, pulls, heavily, from, attachment, theory, pioneers, of, eft, are, les, greenberg, and, sue, johnson, eft, is, often, used, in, therapy, with, individuals, and, may, be, especially, useful, for, couples, therapy, founded, in, 1998, sue, johnson, and, others, lead, the, international, centre, for, excellence, in, emotion, focused, therapy, iceeft, where, clinicians, can, find, eft, training, internationally, eft, is, also, a, commonly, chosen, modality, to, treat, clinically, diagnosable, trauma, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, developed, from, the, combination, of, cognitive, therapy, and, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, both, of, which, grew, out, of, cognitive, psychology, and, behaviorism, cbt, is, based, on, the, theory, that, how, we, think, cognition, how, we, feel, emotion, and, how, we, act, behavior, are, related, and, interact, together, in, complex, ways, in, this, perspective, certain, dysfunctional, ways, of, interpreting, and, appraising, the, world, often, through, schemas, or, beliefs, can, contribute, to, emotional, distress, or, result, in, behavioral, problems, the, object, of, many, cognitive, behavioral, therapies, is, to, discover, and, identify, the, biased, dysfunctional, ways, of, relating, or, reacting, and, through, different, methodologies, help, clients, transcend, these, in, ways, that, will, lead, to, increased, well, being, there, are, many, techniques, used, such, as, systematic, desensitization, socratic, questioning, and, keeping, a, cognition, observation, log, modified, approaches, that, fall, into, the, category, of, cbt, have, also, developed, including, dialectic, behavior, therapy, and, mindfulness, based, cognitive, therapy, behavior, therapy, is, a, rich, tradition, it, is, well, researched, with, a, strong, evidence, base, its, roots, are, in, behaviorism, in, behavior, therapy, environmental, events, predict, the, way, we, think, and, feel, our, behavior, sets, up, conditions, for, the, environment, to, feedback, back, on, it, sometimes, the, feedback, leads, the, behavior, to, increase, reinforcement, and, sometimes, the, behavior, decreases, punishment, oftentimes, behavior, therapists, are, called, applied, behavior, analysts, or, behavioral, health, counselors, they,
