in, finance, and, economics, interest, is, payment, from, a, debtor, or, deposit, taking, financial, institution, to, a, lender, or, depositor, of, an, amount, above, repayment, of, the, principal, sum, that, is, the, amount, borrowed, at, a, particular, rate, it, is, distinct, from, a, fee, which, the, borrower, may, pay, to, the, lender, or, some, third, party, it, is, also, distinct, from, dividend, which, is, paid, by, a, company, to, its, shareholders, owners, from, its, profit, or, reserve, but, not, at, a, particular, rate, decided, beforehand, rather, on, a, pro, rata, basis, as, a, share, in, the, reward, gained, by, risk, taking, entrepreneurs, when, the, revenue, earned, exceeds, the, total, costs, for, example, a, customer, would, usually, pay, interest, to, borrow, from, a, bank, so, they, pay, the, bank, an, amount, which, is, more, than, the, amount, they, borrowed, or, a, customer, may, earn, interest, on, their, savings, and, so, they, may, withdraw, more, than, they, originally, deposited, in, the, case, of, savings, the, customer, is, the, lender, and, the, bank, plays, the, role, of, the, borrower, interest, differs, from, profit, in, that, interest, is, received, by, a, lender, whereas, profit, is, received, by, the, owner, of, an, asset, investment, or, enterprise, interest, may, be, part, or, the, whole, of, the, profit, on, an, investment, but, the, two, concepts, are, distinct, from, each, other, from, an, accounting, perspective, the, rate, of, interest, is, equal, to, the, interest, amount, paid, or, received, over, a, particular, period, divided, by, the, principal, sum, borrowed, or, lent, usually, expressed, as, a, percentage, compound, interest, means, that, interest, is, earned, on, prior, interest, in, addition, to, the, principal, due, to, compounding, the, total, amount, of, debt, grows, exponentially, and, its, mathematical, study, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, number, e, in, practice, interest, is, most, often, calculated, on, a, daily, monthly, or, yearly, basis, and, its, impact, is, influenced, greatly, by, its, compounding, rate, credit, is, thought, to, have, preceded, the, existence, of, coinage, by, several, thousands, of, years, the, first, recorded, instance, of, credit, is, a, collection, of, old, sumerian, documents, from, 3000, bc, that, show, systematic, use, of, credit, to, loan, both, grain, and, metals, the, rise, of, interest, as, a, concept, is, unknown, though, its, use, in, sumeria, argue, that, it, was, well, established, as, a, concept, by, 3000bc, if, not, earlier, with, historians, believing, that, the, concept, in, its, modern, sense, may, have, arisen, from, the, lease, of, animal, or, seeds, for, productive, purposes, the, argument, that, acquired, seeds, and, animals, could, reproduce, themselves, was, used, to, justify, interest, but, ancient, jewish, religious, prohibitions, against, usury, neshekh, represented, a, different, view, the, first, written, evidence, of, compound, interest, dates, roughly, 2400, bc, the, annual, interest, rate, was, roughly, 20, compound, interest, was, necessary, for, the, development, of, agriculture, and, important, for, urbanization, while, the, traditional, middle, eastern, views, on, interest, were, the, result, of, the, urbanized, economically, developed, character, of, the, societies, that, produced, them, the, new, jewish, prohibition, on, interest, showed, a, pastoral, tribal, influence, in, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, since, silver, used, in, exchange, for, livestock, or, grain, could, not, multiply, of, its, own, the, laws, of, eshnunna, instituted, a, legal, interest, rate, specifically, on, deposits, of, dowry, early, muslims, called, this, riba, translated, today, as, the, charging, of, interest, the, first, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, forbade, clergy, from, engaging, in, usury, which, was, defined, as, lending, on, interest, above, 1, percent, per, month, 12, 7, aer, ninth, century, ecumenical, councils, applied, this, regulation, to, the, laity, catholic, church, opposition, to, interest, hardened, in, the, era, of, the, scholastics, when, even, defending, it, was, considered, a, heresy, st, thomas, aquinas, the, leading, theologian, of, the, catholic, church, argued, that, the, charging, of, interest, is, wrong, because, it, amounts, to, double, charging, charging, for, both, the, thing, and, the, use, of, the, thing, in, the, medieval, economy, loans, were, entirely, a, consequence, of, necessity, bad, harvests, fire, in, a, workplace, and, under, those, conditions, it, was, considered, morally, reproachable, to, charge, interest, it, was, also, considered, morally, dubious, since, no, goods, were, produced, through, the, lending, of, money, and, thus, it, should, not, be, compensated, unlike, other, activities, with, direct, physical, output, such, as, blacksmithing, or, farming, for, the, same, reason, interest, has, often, been, looked, down, upon, in, islamic, civilization, with, almost, all, scholars, agreeing, that, the, qur, an, explicitly, forbids, charging, interest, medieval, jurists, developed, several, financial, instruments, to, encourage, responsible, lending, and, circumvent, prohibitions, on, usury, such, as, the, contractum, trinius, in, the, renaissance, era, greater, mobility, of, people, facilitated, an, increase, in, commerce, and, the, appearance, of, appropriate, conditions, for, entrepreneurs, to, start, new, lucrative, businesses, given, that, borrowed, money, was, no, longer, strictly, for, consumption, but, for, production, as, well, interest, was, no, longer, viewed, in, the, same, manner, the, first, attempt, to, control, interest, rates, through, manipulation, of, the, money, supply, was, made, by, the, banque, de, france, in, 1847, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, saw, the, rise, of, interest, free, islamic, banking, and, finance, a, movement, that, applies, islamic, law, to, financial, institutions, and, the, economy, some, countries, including, iran, sudan, and, pakistan, have, taken, steps, to, eradicate, interest, from, their, financial, systems, rather, than, charging, interest, the, interest, free, lender, shares, the, risk, by, investing, as, a, partner, in, profit, loss, sharing, scheme, because, predetermined, loan, repayment, as, interest, is, prohibited, as, well, as, making, money, out, of, money, is, unacceptable, all, financial, transactions, must, be, asset, backed, and, must, not, charge, any, interest, or, fee, for, the, service, of, lending, it, is, thought, that, jacob, bernoulli, discovered, the, mathematical, constant, e, by, studying, a, question, about, compound, interest, he, realized, that, if, an, account, that, starts, with, 1, 00, and, pays, say, 100, interest, per, year, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, value, is, 2, 00, but, if, the, interest, is, computed, and, added, twice, in, the, year, the, 1, is, multiplied, by, 1, 5, twice, yielding, 1, 00, 1, 5, 2, 2, 25, compounding, quarterly, yields, 1, 00, 1, 25, 4, 2, 4414, and, so, on, bernoulli, noticed, that, if, the, frequency, of, compounding, is, increased, without, limit, this, sequence, can, be, modeled, as, follows, where, n, is, the, number, of, times, the, interest, is, to, be, compounded, in, a, year, in, economics, the, rate, of, interest, is, the, price, of, credit, and, it, plays, the, role, of, the, cost, of, capital, in, a, free, market, economy, interest, rates, are, subject, to, the, law, of, supply, and, demand, of, the, money, supply, and, one, explanation, of, the, tendency, of, interest, rates, to, be, generally, greater, than, zero, is, the, scarcity, of, loanable, funds, over, centuries, various, schools, of, thought, have, developed, explanations, of, interest, and, interest, rates, the, school, of, salamanca, justified, paying, interest, in, terms, of, the, benefit, to, the, borrower, and, interest, received, by, the, lender, in, terms, of, a, premium, for, the, risk, of, default, in, the, sixteenth, century, mart, n, de, azpilcueta, applied, a, time, preference, argument, it, is, preferable, to, receive, a, given, good, now, rather, than, in, the, future, accordingly, interest, is, compensation, for, the, time, the, lender, forgoes, the, benefit, of, spending, the, money, on, the, question, of, why, interest, rates, are, normally, greater, than, zero, in, 1770, french, economist, anne, robert, jacques, turgot, baron, de, laune, proposed, the, theory, of, fructification, by, applying, an, opportunity, cost, argument, comparing, the, loan, rate, with, the, rate, of, return, on, agricultural, land, and, a, mathematical, argument, applying, the, formula, for, the, value, of, a, perpetuity, to, a, plantation, he, argued, that, the, land, value, would, rise, without, limit, as, the, interest, rate, approached, zero, for, the, land, value, to, remain, positive, and, finite, keeps, the, interest, rate, above, zero, adam, smith, carl, menger, and, fr, d, ric, bastiat, also, propounded, theories, of, interest, rates, in, the, late, 19th, century, swedish, economist, knut, wicksell, in, his, 1898, interest, and, prices, elaborated, a, comprehensive, theory, of, economic, crises, based, upon, a, distinction, between, natural, and, nominal, interest, rates, in, the, 1930s, wicksell, s, approach, was, refined, by, bertil, ohlin, and, dennis, robertson, and, became, known, as, the, loanable, funds, theory, other, notable, interest, rate, theories, of, the, period, are, those, of, irving, fisher, and, john, maynard, keynes, simple, interest, is, calculated, only, on, the, principal, amount, or, on, that, portion, of, the, principal, amount, that, remains, it, excludes, the, effect, of, compounding, simple, interest, can, be, applied, over, a, time, period, other, than, a, year, for, example, every, month, simple, interest, is, calculated, according, to, the, following, formula, where, for, example, imagine, that, a, credit, card, holder, has, an, outstanding, balance, of, 2500, and, that, the, simple, annual, interest, rate, is, 12, 99, per, annum, applied, monthly, so, the, frequency, of, applying, interest, is, 12, per, year, over, one, month, interest, is, due, rounded, to, the, nearest, cent, simple, interest, applied, over, 3, months, would, be, if, the, card, holder, pays, off, only, interest, at, the, end, of, each, of, the, 3, months, the, total, amount, of, interest, paid, would, be, which, is, the, simple, interest, applied, over, 3, months, as, calculated, above, the, one, cent, difference, arises, due, to, rounding, to, the, nearest, cent, compound, interest, includes, interest, earned, on, the, interest, that, was, previously, accumulated, compare, for, example, a, bond, paying, 6, percent, semiannually, that, is, coupons, of, 3, percent, twice, a, year, with, a, certificate, of, deposit, gic, that, pays, 6, percent, interest, once, a, year, the, total, interest, payment, is, 6, per, 100, par, value, in, both, cases, but, the, holder, of, the, semiannual, bond, receives, half, the, 6, per, year, after, only, 6, months, time, preference, and, so, has, the, opportunity, to, reinvest, the, first, 3, coupon, payment, after, the, first, 6, months, and, earn, additional, interest, for, example, suppose, an, investor, buys, 10, 000, par, value, of, a, us, dollar, bond, which, pays, coupons, twice, a, year, and, that, the, bond, s, simple, annual, coupon, rate, is, 6, percent, per, year, this, means, that, every, 6, months, the, issuer, pays, the, holder, of, the, bond, a, coupon, of, 3, dollars, per, 100, dollars, par, value, at, the, end, of, 6, months, the, issuer, pays, the, holder, assuming, the, market, price, of, the, bond, is, 100, so, it, is, trading, at, par, value, suppose, further, that, the, holder, immediately, reinvests, the, coupon, by, spending, it, on, another, 300, par, value, of, the, bond, in, total, the, investor, therefore, now, holds, and, so, earns, a, coupon, at, the, end, of, the, next, 6, months, of, assuming, the, bond, remains, priced, at, par, the, investor, accumulates, at, the, end, of, a, full, 12, months, a, total, value, of, and, the, investor, earned, in, total, the, formula, for, the, annual, equivalent, compound, interest, rate, is, where, for, example, in, the, case, of, a, 6, simple, annual, rate, the, annual, equivalent, compound, rate, is, the, outstanding, balance, b, n, of, a, loan, after, n, regular, payments, increases, each, period, by, a, growth, factor, according, to, the, periodic, interest, and, then, decreases, by, the, amount, paid, p, at, the, end, of, each, period, where, by, repeated, substitution, one, obtains, expressions, for, b, n, which, are, linearly, proportional, to, b, 0, and, p, and, use, of, the, formula, for, the, partial, sum, of, a, geometric, series, results, in, a, solution, of, this, expression, for, p, in, terms, of, b, 0, and, b, n, reduces, to, to, find, the, payment, if, the, loan, is, to, be, finished, in, n, payments, one, sets, b, n, 0, the, pmt, function, found, in, spreadsheet, programs, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, monthly, payment, of, a, loan, an, interest, only, payment, on, the, current, balance, would, be, the, total, interest, i, t, paid, on, the, loan, is, the, formulas, for, a, regular, savings, program, are, similar, but, the, payments, are, added, to, the, balances, instead, of, being, subtracted, and, the, formula, for, the, payment, is, the, negative, of, the, one, above, these, formulas, are, only, approximate, since, actual, loan, balances, are, affected, by, rounding, to, avoid, an, underpayment, at, the, end, of, the, loan, the, payment, must, be, rounded, up, to, the, next, cent, consider, a, similar, loan, but, with, a, new, period, equal, to, k, periods, of, the, problem, above, if, r, k, and, p, k, are, the, new, rate, and, payment, we, now, have, comparing, this, with, the, expression, for, b, k, above, we, note, that, and, the, last, equation, allows, us, to, define, a, constant, that, is, the, same, for, both, problems, and, b, k, can, be, written, as, solving, for, r, k, we, find, a, formula, for, r, k, involving, known, quantities, and, b, k, the, balance, after, k, periods, since, b, 0, could, be, any, balance, in, the, loan, the, formula, works, for, any, two, balances, separate, by, k, periods, and, can, be, used, to, compute, a, value, for, the, annual, interest, rate, b, is, a, scale, invariant, since, it, does, not, change, with, changes, in, the, length, of, the, period, rearranging, the, equation, for, b, one, obtains, a, transformation, coefficient, scale, factor, and, we, see, that, r, and, p, transform, in, the, same, manner, the, change, in, the, balance, transforms, likewise, which, gives, an, insight, into, the, meaning, of, some, of, the, coefficients, found, in, the, formulas, above, the, annual, rate, r, 12, assumes, only, one, payment, per, year, and, is, not, an, effective, rate, for, monthly, payments, with, monthly, payments, the, monthly, interest, is, paid, out, of, each, payment, and, so, should, not, be, compounded, and, an, annual, rate, of, 12, r, would, make, more, sense, if, one, just, made, interest, only, payments, the, amount, paid, for, the, year, would, be, 12, r, b, 0, substituting, p, k, r, k, b, into, the, equation, for, the, b, k, we, obtain, since, b, n, 0, we, can, solve, for, b, substituting, back, into, the, formula, for, the, b, k, shows, that, they, are, a, linear, function, of, the, r, k, and, therefore, the, k, this, is, the, easiest, way, of, estimating, the, balances, if, the, k, are, known, substituting, into, the, first, formula, for, b, k, above, and, solving, for, k, 1, we, obtain, 0, and, n, can, be, found, using, the, formula, for, k, above, or, computing, the, k, recursively, from, 0, 0, to, n, since, p, rb, the, formula, for, the, payment, reduces, to, and, the, average, interest, rate, over, the, period, of, the, loan, is, which, is, less, than, r, if, n, 1, in, the, age, before, electronic, computers, were, widely, available, flat, rate, consumer, loans, in, the, united, states, of, america, would, be, priced, using, the, rule, of, 78s, or, sum, of, digits, method, the, sum, of, the, integers, from, 1, to, 12, is, 78, the, technique, required, only, a, simple, calculation, payments, remain, constant, over, the, life, of, the, loan, however, payments, are, allocated, to, interest, in, progressively, smaller, amounts, in, a, one, year, loan, in, the, first, month, 12, 78, of, all, interest, owed, over, the, life, of, the, loan, is, due, in, the, second, month, 11, 78, progressing, to, the, twelfth, month, where, only, 1, 78, of, all, interest, is, due, the, practical, effect, of, the, rule, of, 78s, is, to, make, early, pay, offs, of, term, loans, more, expensive, for, a, one, year, loan, approximately, 3, 4, of, all, interest, due, is, collected, by, the, sixth, month, and, pay, off, of, the, principal, then, will, cause, the, effective, interest, rate, to, be, much, higher, than, the, apr, used, to, calculate, the, payments, in, 1992, the, united, states, outlawed, the, use, of, rule, of, 78s, interest, in, connection, with, mortgage, refinancing, and, other, consumer, loans, over, five, years, in, term, certain, other, jurisdictions, have, outlawed, application, of, the, rule, of, 78s, in, certain, types, of, loans, particularly, consumer, loans, to, approximate, how, long, it, takes, for, money, to, double, at, a, given, interest, rate, that, is, for, accumulated, compound, interest, to, reach, or, exceed, the, initial, deposit, divide, 72, by, the, percentage, interest, rate, for, example, compounding, at, an, annual, interest, rate, of, 6, percent, it, will, take, 72, 6, 12, years, for, the, money, to, double, the, rule, provides, a, good, indication, for, interest, rates, up, to, 10, in, the, case, of, an, interest, rate, of, 18, percent, the, rule, of, 72, predicts, that, money, will, double, after, 72, 18, 4, years, in, the, case, of, an, interest, rate, of, 24, percent, the, rule, predicts, that, money, will, double, after, 72, 24, 3, years, there, are, markets, for, investments, which, include, the, money, market, bond, market, as, well, as, retail, financial, institutions, like, banks, that, set, interest, rates, each, specific, debt, takes, into, account, the, following, factors, in, determining, its, interest, rate, opportunity, cost, encompasses, any, other, use, to, which, the, money, could, be, put, including, lending, to, others, investing, elsewhere, holding, cash, or, spending, the, funds, charging, interest, equal, to, inflation, preserves, the, lender, s, purchasing, power, but, does, not, compensate, for, the, time, value, of, money, in, real, terms, the, lender, may, prefer, to, invest, in, another, product, rather, than, consume, the, return, they, might, obtain, from, competing, investments, is, a, factor, in, determining, the, interest, rate, they, demand, since, the, lender, is, deferring, consumption, they, will, wish, as, a, bare, minimum, to, recover, enough, to, pay, the, increased, cost, of, goods, due, to, inflation, because, future, inflation, is, unknown, there, are, three, ways, this, might, be, achieved, however, interest, rates, are, set, by, the, market, and, it, happens, frequently, that, they, are, insufficient, to, compensate, for, inflation, for, example, at, times, of, high, inflation, during, for, example, the, oil, crisis, and, during, 2011, when, real, yields, on, many, inflation, linked, government, stocks, are, negative, there, is, always, the, risk, the, borrower, will, become, bankrupt, abscond, or, otherwise, default, on, the, loan, the, risk, premium, attempts, to, measure, the, integrity, of, the, borrower, the, risk, of, his, enterprise, succeeding, and, the, security, of, any, collateral, pledged, for, example, loans, to, developing, countries, have, higher, risk, premiums, than, those, to, the, us, government, due, to, the, difference, in, creditworthiness, an, operating, line, of, credit, to, a, business, will, have, a, higher, rate, than, a, mortgage, loan, the, creditworthiness, of, businesses, is, measured, by, bond, rating, services, and, individual, s, credit, scores, by, credit, bureaus, the, risks, of, an, individual, debt, may, have, a, large, standard, deviation, of, possibilities, the, lender, may, want, to, cover, his, maximum, risk, but, lenders, with, portfolios, of, debt, can, lower, the, risk, premium, to, cover, just, the, most, probable, outcome, in, economics, interest, is, considered, the, price, of, credit, therefore, it, is, also, subject, to, distortions, due, to, inflation, the, nominal, interest, rate, which, refers, to, the, price, before, adjustment, to, inflation, is, the, one, visible, to, the, consumer, that, is, the, interest, tagged, in, a, loan, contract, credit, card, statement, etc, nominal, interest, is, composed, of, the, real, interest, rate, plus, inflation, among, other, factors, an, approximate, formula, for, the, nominal, interest, is, where, however, not, all, borrowers, and, lenders, have, access, to, the, same, interest, rate, even, if, they, are, subject, to, the, same, inflation, furthermore, expectations, of, future, inflation, vary, so, a, forward, looking, interest, rate, cannot, depend, on, a, single, real, interest, rate, plus, a, single, expected, rate, of, inflation, interest, rates, also, depend, on, credit, quality, or, risk, of, default, governments, are, normally, highly, reliable, debtors, and, the, interest, rate, on, government, securities, is, normally, lower, than, the, interest, rate, available, to, other, borrowers, the, equation, relates, expectations, of, inflation, and, credit, risk, to, nominal, and, expected, real, interest, rates, over, the, life, of, a, loan, where, default, interest, is, the, rate, of, interest, that, a, borrower, must, pay, after, material, breach, of, a, loan, covenant, the, default, interest, is, usually, much, higher, than, the, original, interest, rate, since, it, is, reflecting, the, aggravation, in, the, financial, risk, of, the, borrower, default, interest, compensates, the, lender, for, the, added, risk, from, the, borrower, s, perspective, this, means, failure, to, make, their, regular, payment, for, one, or, two, payment, periods, or, failure, to, pay, taxes, or, insurance, premiums, for, the, loan, collateral, will, lead, to, substantially, higher, interest, for, the, entire, remaining, term, of, the, loan, banks, tend, to, add, default, interest, to, the, loan, agreements, in, order, to, separate, between, different, scenarios, in, some, jurisdictions, default, interest, clauses, are, unenforceable, as, against, public, policy, shorter, terms, often, have, less, risk, of, default, and, exposure, to, inflation, because, the, near, future, is, easier, to, predict, in, these, circumstances, short, term, interest, rates, are, lower, than, longer, term, interest, rates, an, upward, sloping, yield, curve, interest, rates, are, generally, determined, by, the, market, but, government, intervention, usually, by, a, central, bank, may, strongly, influence, short, term, interest, rates, and, is, one, of, the, main, tools, of, monetary, policy, the, central, bank, offers, to, borrow, or, lend, large, quantities, of, money, at, a, rate, which, they, determine, sometimes, this, is, money, that, they, have, created, ex, nihilo, that, is, printed, which, has, a, major, influence, on, supply, and, demand, and, hence, on, market, interest, rates, the, federal, reserve, fed, implements, monetary, policy, largely, by, targeting, the, federal, funds, rate, this, is, the, rate, that, banks, charge, each, other, for, overnight, loans, of, federal, funds, federal, funds, are, the, reserves, held, by, banks, at, the, fed, open, market, operations, are, one, tool, within, monetary, policy, implemented, by, the, federal, reserve, to, steer, short, term, interest, rates, using, the, power, to, buy, and, sell, treasury, securities, the, open, market, desk, at, the, federal, reserve, bank, of, new, york, can, supply, the, market, with, dollars, by, purchasing, u, s, treasury, notes, hence, increasing, the, nation, s, money, supply, by, increasing, the, money, supply, or, aggregate, supply, of, funding, asf, interest, rates, will, fall, due, to, the, excess, of, dollars, banks, will, end, up, with, in, their, reserves, excess, reserves, may, be, lent, in, the, fed, funds, market, to, other, banks, thus, driving, down, rates, it, is, increasingly, recognized, that, during, the, business, cycle, interest, rates, and, credit, risk, are, tightly, interrelated, the, jarrow, turnbull, model, was, the, first, model, of, credit, risk, that, explicitly, had, random, interest, rates, at, its, core, lando, 2004, darrell, duffie, and, singleton, 2003, and, van, deventer, and, imai, 2003, discuss, interest, rates, when, the, issuer, of, the, interest, bearing, instrument, can, default, loans, and, bonds, have, some, of, the, characteristics, of, money, and, are, included, in, the, broad, money, supply, national, governments, provided, of, course, that, the, country, has, retained, its, own, currency, can, influence, interest, rates, and, thus, the, supply, and, demand, for, such, loans, thus, altering, the, total, of, loans, and, bonds, issued, generally, speaking, a, higher, real, interest, rate, reduces, the, broad, money, supply, through, the, quantity, theory, of, money, increases, in, the, money, supply, lead, to, inflation, this, means, that, interest, rates, can, affect, inflation, in, the, future, liquidity, is, the, ability, to, quickly, re, sell, an, asset, for, fair, or, near, fair, value, all, else, equal, an, investor, will, want, a, higher, return, on, an, illiquid, asset, than, a, liquid, one, to, compensate, for, the, loss, of, the, option, to, sell, it, at, any, time, u, s, treasury, bonds, are, highly, liquid, with, an, active, secondary, market, while, some, other, debts, are, less, liquid, in, the, mortgage, market, the, lowest, rates, are, often, issued, on, loans, that, can, be, re, sold, as, securitized, loans, highly, non, traditional, loans, such, as, seller, financing, often, carry, higher, interest, rates, due, to, a, lack, of, liquidity, aristotle, and, the, scholastics, held, that, it, was, unjust, to, claim, payment, except, in, compensation, for, one, s, own, efforts, and, sacrifices, and, that, since, money, is, by, its, nature, sterile, there, is, no, loss, in, being, temporarily, separated, from, it, compensation, for, risk, or, for, the, trouble, of, setting, up, a, loan, was, not, necessarily, impermissible, on, these, grounds, nicholas, barbon, c, 1640, c, 1698, described, as, a, mistake, the, view, that, interest, is, a, monetary, value, arguing, that, because, money, is, typically, borrowed, to, buy, assets, goods, and, stock, the, interest, that, is, charged, on, a, loan, is, a, type, of, rent, a, payment, for, the, use, of, goods, according, to, schumpeter, barbon, s, theories, were, forgotten, until, similar, views, were, put, forward, by, joseph, massie, in, 1750, in, 1752, david, hume, published, his, essay, of, money, which, relates, interest, to, the, demand, for, borrowing, the, riches, available, to, supply, that, demand, and, the, profits, arising, from, commerce, schumpeter, considered, hume, s, theory, superior, to, that, of, ricardo, and, mill, but, the, reference, to, profits, concentrates, to, a, surprising, degree, on, commerce, rather, than, on, industry, turgot, brought, the, theory, of, interest, close, to, its, classical, form, industrialists, share, their, profits, with, capitalists, who, supply, the, funds, r, flexions, lxxi, the, share, that, goes, to, the, latter, is, determined, like, all, other, prices, lxxv, by, the, play, of, supply, and, demand, amongst, borrowers, and, lenders, so, that, the, analysis, is, from, the, outset, firmly, planted, in, the, general, theory, of, prices, the, classical, theory, was, the, work, of, a, number, of, authors, including, turgot, ricardo, mountifort, longfield, j, s, mill, and, irving, fisher, it, was, strongly, criticised, by, keynes, whose, remarks, nonetheless, made, a, positive, contribution, to, it, mill, s, theory, is, set, out, the, chapter, of, the, rate, of, interest, in, his, principles, of, political, economy, he, says, that, the, interest, rate, adjusts, to, maintain, equilibrium, between, the, demands, for, lending, and, borrowing, individuals, lend, in, order, to, defer, consumption, or, for, the, sake, of, the, greater, quantity, they, will, be, able, to, consume, at, a, later, date, owing, to, interest, earned, they, borrow, in, order, to, anticipate, consumption, whose, relative, desirability, is, reflected, by, the, time, value, of, money, but, entrepreneurs, also, borrow, to, fund, investment, and, governments, borrow, for, their, own, reasons, the, three, sources, of, demand, compete, for, loans, for, entrepreneurial, borrowing, to, be, in, equilibrium, with, lending, the, interest, for, money, is, regulated, by, the, rate, of, profits, which, can, be, made, by, the, employment, of, capital, ricardo, s, and, mill, s, profit, is, made, more, precise, by, the, concept, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, the, expression, though, not, the, concept, is, due, to, keynes, which, may, be, defined, as, the, annual, revenue, which, will, be, yielded, by, an, extra, increment, of, capital, as, a, proportion, of, its, cost, so, the, interest, rate, r, in, equilibrium, will, be, equal, to, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, r, rather, than, work, with, r, and, r, as, separate, variables, we, can, assume, that, they, are, equal, and, let, the, single, variable, r, denote, their, common, value, the, investment, schedule, i, r, shows, how, much, investment, is, possible, with, a, return, of, at, least, r, in, a, stationary, economy, it, is, likely, to, resemble, the, blue, curve, in, the, diagram, with, a, step, shape, arising, from, the, assumption, that, opportunities, to, invest, with, yields, greater, than, r, have, been, largely, exhausted, while, there, is, untapped, scope, to, invest, with, a, lower, return, saving, is, the, excess, of, deferred, over, anticipated, consumption, and, its, dependence, on, income, is, much, as, described, by, keynes, see, the, general, theory, but, in, classical, theory, definitely, an, increasing, function, of, r, the, dependence, of, s, on, income, y, was, not, relevant, to, classical, concerns, prior, to, the, development, of, theories, of, unemployment, the, rate, of, interest, is, given, by, the, intersection, of, the, solid, red, saving, curve, with, the, blue, investment, schedule, but, so, long, as, the, investment, schedule, is, almost, vertical, a, change, in, income, leading, in, extreme, cases, to, the, broken, red, saving, curve, will, make, little, difference, to, the, interest, rate, in, some, cases, the, analysis, will, be, less, simple, the, introduction, of, a, new, technique, leading, to, demand, for, new, forms, of, capital, will, shift, the, step, to, the, right, and, reduce, its, steepness, or, a, sudden, increase, in, the, desire, to, anticipate, consumption, perhaps, through, military, spending, in, time, of, war, will, absorb, most, available, loans, the, interest, rate, will, increase, and, investment, will, be, reduced, to, the, amount, whose, return, exceeds, it, this, is, illustrated, by, the, dotted, red, saving, curve, in, the, case, of, extraordinary, spending, in, time, of, war, the, government, may, wish, to, borrow, more, than, the, public, would, be, willing, to, lend, at, a, normal, interest, rate, if, the, dotted, red, curve, started, negative, and, showed, no, tendency, to, increase, with, r, then, the, government, would, be, trying, to, buy, what, the, public, was, unwilling, to, sell, at, any, price, keynes, mentions, this, possibility, as, a, point, which, might, perhaps, have, warned, the, classical, school, that, something, was, wrong, p, 182, he, also, remarks, on, the, same, page, that, the, classical, theory, does, not, explain, the, usual, supposition, that, an, increase, in, the, quantity, of, money, has, a, tendency, to, reduce, the, rate, of, interest, at, any, rate, in, the, first, instance, keynes, s, diagram, of, the, investment, schecule, lacks, the, step, shape, which, can, be, seen, as, part, of, the, classical, theory, he, objects, that, the, functions, used, by, classical, theory, do, not, furnish, material, for, a, theory, of, the, rate, of, interest, but, they, could, be, used, to, tell, us, what, the, rate, of, interest, will, have, to, be, if, the, level, of, employment, is, maintained, at, a, given, figure, later, p, 184, keynes, claims, that, it, involves, a, circular, argument, to, construct, a, theory, of, interest, from, the, investment, schedule, since, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, partly, depends, on, the, scale, of, current, investment, and, we, must, already, know, the, rate, of, interest, before, we, can, calculate, what, this, scale, will, be, the, classical, theory, of, interest, explains, it, as, the, capitalist, s, share, of, business, profits, but, the, pre, marginalist, authors, were, unable, to, reconcile, these, profits, with, the, labor, theory, of, value, excluding, longfield, who, was, essentially, a, marginalist, their, responses, often, had, a, moral, tone, ricardo, and, marx, viewed, profits, as, exploitation, and, mcculloch, s, productivity, theory, justified, profits, by, portraying, capital, equipment, as, an, embodiment, of, accumulated, labor, the, theory, that, interest, is, a, payment, for, abstinence, is, attributed, to, nassau, senior, and, according, to, schumpeter, was, intended, neutrally, but, it, can, easily, be, understood, as, making, a, moral, claim, and, was, sharply, criticised, by, marx, and, lassalle, knut, wicksell, published, his, interest, and, prices, in, 1898, elaborating, a, comprehensive, theory, of, economic, crises, based, upon, a, distinction, between, natural, and, nominal, interest, rates, wicksell, s, contribution, in, fact, was, twofold, first, he, separated, the, monetary, rate, of, interest, from, the, hypothetical, natural, rate, that, would, have, resulted, from, equilibrium, of, capital, supply, and, demand, in, a, barter, economy, and, he, assumed, that, as, a, result, of, the, presence, of, money, alone, the, effective, market, rate, could, fail, to, correspond, to, this, ideal, rate, in, actuality, next, he, supposed, that, through, the, mechanism, of, credit, the, rate, of, interest, had, an, influence, on, prices, that, a, rise, of, the, monetary, rate, above, the, natural, level, produced, a, fall, and, a, decline, below, that, level, a, rise, in, prices, but, wicksell, went, on, to, conclude, that, if, the, natural, rate, coincided, with, the, monetary, rate, stability, of, prices, would, follow, in, the, 1930s, wicksell, s, approach, was, refined, by, bertil, ohlin, and, dennis, robertson, and, became, known, as, the, loanable, funds, theory, eugen, b, hm, von, bawerk, and, other, members, of, the, austrian, school, also, put, forward, notable, theories, of, the, interest, rate, the, doyen, of, the, austrian, school, murray, n, rothbard, sees, the, emphasis, on, the, loan, market, which, makes, up, the, general, analysis, on, interest, as, a, mistaken, view, to, take, as, he, explains, in, his, primary, economic, work, man, economy, and, state, the, market, rate, of, interest, is, but, a, manifestation, of, the, natural, phenomenon, of, time, preference, which, is, to, prefer, present, goods, to, future, goods, to, rothbard, too, many, writers, consider, the, rate, of, interest, as, only, the, price, of, loans, on, the, loan, market, in, reality, the, rate, of, interest, pervades, all, time, markets, and, the, productive, loan, market, is, a, strictly, subsidiary, time, market, of, only, derivative, importance, interest, is, explainable, by, the, rate, of, time, preference, among, the, people, to, point, to, the, loan, market, is, insufficient, at, best, rather, the, rate, of, interest, is, what, would, be, observed, between, the, stages, of, production, indeed, a, time, market, itself, where, capital, goods, which, are, used, to, make, consumers, goods, are, ordered, out, further, in, time, away, from, the, final, consumers, goods, stage, of, the, economy, where, consumption, takes, place, it, is, this, spread, between, these, various, stages, which, will, tend, toward, uniformity, with, consumers, goods, representing, present, goods, and, producers, goods, representing, future, goods, that, the, real, rate, of, interest, is, observed, rothbard, has, said, that, interest, rate, is, equal, to, the, rate, of, price, spread, in, the, various, stages, rothbard, has, furthermore, criticized, the, keynesian, conception, of, interest, saying, one, grave, and, fundamental, keynesian, error, is, to, persist, in, regarding, the, interest, rate, as, a, contract, rate, on, loans, instead, of, the, price, spreads, between, stages, of, production, pareto, held, that, the, interest, rate, being, one, of, the, many, elements, of, the, general, system, of, equilibrium, was, of, course, simultaneously, determined, with, all, of, them, so, that, there, was, no, point, at, all, in, looking, for, any, particular, element, that, caused, interest, interest, is, one, of, the, main, components, of, the, economic, theories, developed, in, keynes, s, 1936, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, in, his, initial, account, of, liquidity, preference, the, demand, for, money, in, chapter, 13, this, demand, is, solely, a, function, of, the, interest, rate, and, since, the, supply, is, given, and, equilibrium, is, assumed, the, interest, rate, is, determined, by, the, money, supply, in, his, later, account, chapter, 15, interest, cannot, be, separated, from, other, economic, variables, and, needs, to, be, analysed, together, with, them, see, the, general, theory, for, details, jews, are, forbidden, from, usury, in, dealing, with, fellow, jews, and, this, lending, is, to, be, considered, tzedakah, or, charity, however, there, are, permissions, to, charge, interest, on, loans, to, non, jews, this, is, outlined, in, the, jewish, scriptures, of, the, torah, which, christians, hold, as, part, of, the, old, testament, and, other, books, of, the, tanakh, from, the, jewish, publication, society, s, 1917, tanakh, with, christian, verse, numbers, where, different, in, parentheses, if, thou, lend, money, to, any, of, my, people, even, to, the, poor, with, thee, thou, shalt, not, be, to, him, as, a, creditor, neither, shall, ye, lay, upon, him, interest, take, thou, no, interest, of, him, or, increase, but, fear, thy, god, that, thy, brother, may, live, with, thee, thou, shalt, not, give, him, thy, money, upon, interest, nor, give, him, thy, victuals, for, increase, thou, shalt, not, lend, upon, interest, to, thy, brother, interest, of, money, interest, of, victuals, interest, of, any, thing, that, is, lent, upon, interest, unto, a, foreigner, thou, mayest, lend, upon, interest, but, unto, thy, brother, thou, shalt, not, lend, upon, interest, that, the, lord, thy, god, may, bless, thee, in, all, that, thou, puttest, thy, hand, unto, in, the, land, whither, thou, goest, in, to, possess, it, that, hath, withdrawn, his, hand, from, the, poor, that, hath, not, received, interest, nor, increase, hath, executed, mine, ordinances, hath, walked, in, my, statutes, he, shall, not, die, for, the, iniquity, of, his, father, he, shall, surely, live, he, that, putteth, not, out, his, money, on, interest, nor, taketh, a, bribe, against, the, innocent, he, that, doeth, these, things, shall, never, be, moved, several, historical, rulings, in, jewish, law, have, mitigated, the, allowances, for, usury, toward, non, jews, for, instance, the, 15th, century, commentator, rabbi, isaac, abrabanel, specified, that, the, rubric, for, allowing, interest, does, not, apply, to, christians, or, muslims, because, their, faith, systems, have, a, common, ethical, basis, originating, from, judaism, the, medieval, commentator, rabbi, david, kimchi, extended, this, principle, to, non, jews, who, show, consideration, for, jews, saying, they, should, be, treated, with, the, same, consideration, when, they, borrow, the, following, quotations, are, english, translations, from, the, qur, an, those, who, charge, usury, are, in, the, same, position, as, those, controlled, by, the, devil, s, influence, this, is, because, they, claim, that, usury, is, the, same, as, commerce, however, god, permits, commerce, and, prohibits, usury, thus, whoever, heeds, this, commandment, from, his, lord, and, refrains, from, usury, he, may, keep, his, past, earnings, and, his, judgment, rests, with, god, as, for, those, who, persist, in, usury, they, incur, hell, wherein, they, abide, forever, god, condemns, usury, and, blesses, charities, god, dislikes, every, sinning, disbeliever, those, who, believe, and, do, good, works, and, establish, worship, and, pay, the, poor, due, their, reward, is, with, their, lord, and, there, shall, no, fear, come, upon, them, neither, shall, they, grieve, o, you, who, believe, you, shall, observe, god, and, refrain, from, all, kinds, of, usury, if, you, are, believers, if, you, do, not, then, expect, a, war, from, god, and, his, messenger, but, if, you, repent, you, may, keep, your, capitals, without, inflicting, injustice, or, incurring, injustice, if, the, debtor, is, unable, to, pay, wait, for, a, better, time, if, you, give, up, the, loan, as, a, charity, it, would, be, better, for, you, if, you, only, knew, o, you, who, believe, you, shall, not, take, usury, compounded, over, and, over, observe, god, that, you, may, succeed, and, for, practicing, usury, which, was, forbidden, and, for, consuming, the, people, s, money, illicitly, we, have, prepared, for, the, disbelievers, among, them, painful, retribution, the, usury, that, is, practiced, to, increase, some, people, s, wealth, does, not, gain, anything, at, god, but, if, people, give, to, charity, seeking, god, s, pleasure, these, are, the, ones, who, receive, their, reward, many, fold, the, attitude, of, muhammad, to, usury, is, articulated, in, his, last, sermon, o, people, just, as, you, regard, this, month, this, day, this, city, as, sacred, so, regard, the, life, and, property, of, every, muslim, as, a, sacred, trust, return, the, goods, entrusted, to, you, to, their, rightful, owners, hurt, no, one, so, that, no, one, may, hurt, you, remember, that, you, will, indeed, meet, your, lord, and, that, he, will, indeed, reckon, your, deeds, allah, has, forbidden, you, to, take, usury, therefore, all, usurious, obligation, shall, henceforth, be, waived, your, capital, however, is, yours, to, keep, you, will, neither, inflict, nor, suffer, any, inequity, allah, has, judged, that, there, shall, be, no, usury, and, that, all, the, usury, due, to, abbas, ibn, abd, al, muttalib, prophet, s, uncle, shall, henceforth, be, waived, the, old, testament, condemns, the, practice, of, charging, interest, because, a, loan, should, be, an, act, of, compassion, and, taking, care, of, one, s, neighbor, it, teaches, that, making, a, profit, off, a, loan, is, exploiting, that, person, and, dishonoring, god, s, covenant, exodus, 22, 25, 27, the, first, of, the, scholastic, christian, theologians, saint, anselm, of, canterbury, led, the, shift, in, thought, that, labeled, charging, interest, the, same, as, theft, previously, usury, had, been, seen, as, a, lack, of, charity, st, thomas, aquinas, the, leading, scholastic, theologian, of, the, roman, catholic, church, argued, charging, of, interest, is, wrong, because, it, amounts, to, double, charging, charging, for, both, the, thing, and, the, use, of, the, thing, aquinas, said, this, would, be, morally, wrong, in, the, same, way, as, if, one, sold, a, bottle, of, wine, charged, for, the, bottle, of, wine, and, then, charged, for, the, person, using, the, wine, to, actually, drink, it, similarly, one, cannot, charge, for, a, piece, of, cake, and, for, the, eating, of, the, piece, of, cake, yet, this, said, aquinas, is, what, usury, does, money, is, a, medium, of, exchange, and, is, used, up, when, it, is, spent, to, charge, for, the, money, and, for, its, use, by, spending, is, therefore, to, charge, for, the, money, twice, it, is, also, to, sell, time, since, the, usurer, charges, in, effect, for, the, time, that, the, money, is, in, the, hands, of, the, borrower, time, however, is, not, a, commodity, that, anyone, can, charge, in, condemning, usury, aquinas, was, much, influenced, by, the, recently, rediscovered, philosophical, writings, of, aristotle, and, his, desire, to, assimilate, greek, philosophy, with, christian, theology, aquinas, argued, that, in, the, case, of, usury, as, in, other, aspects, of, christian, revelation, christian, doctrine, is, reinforced, by, aristotelian, natural, law, rationalism, aristotle, s, argument, is, that, interest, is, unnatural, since, money, as, a, sterile, element, cannot, naturally, reproduce, itself, thus, usury, conflicts, with, natural, law, just, as, it, offends, christian, revelation, see, thought, of, thomas, aquinas, as, such, aquinas, taught, that, interest, is, inherently, unjust, and, one, who, charges, interest, sins, outlawing, usury, did, not, prevent, investment, but, stipulated, that, in, order, for, the, investor, to, share, in, the, profit, he, must, share, the, risk, in, short, he, must, be, a, joint, venturer, simply, to, invest, the, money, and, expect, it, to, be, returned, regardless, of, the, success, of, the, venture, was, to, make, money, simply, by, having, money, and, not, by, taking, any, risk, or, by, doing, any, work, or, by, any, effort, or, sacrifice, at, all, which, is, usury, st, thomas, quotes, aristotle, as, saying, that, to, live, by, usury, is, exceedingly, unnatural, islam, likewise, condemns, usury, but, allowed, commerce, al, baqarah, 2, 275, an, alternative, that, suggests, investment, and, sharing, of, profit, and, loss, instead, of, sharing, only, profit, through, interests, judaism, condemns, usury, towards, jews, but, allows, it, towards, non, jews, deut, 23, 19, 20, st, thomas, allows, however, charges, for, actual, services, provided, thus, a, banker, or, credit, lender, could, charge, for, such, actual, work, or, effort, as, he, did, carry, out, for, example, any, fair, administrative, charges, the, catholic, church, in, a, decree, of, the, fifth, council, of, the, lateran, expressly, allowed, such, charges, in, respect, of, credit, unions, run, for, the, benefit, of, the, poor, known, as, montes, pietatis, in, the, 13th, century, cardinal, hostiensis, enumerated, thirteen, situations, in, which, charging, interest, was, not, immoral, the, most, important, of, these, was, lucrum, cessans, profits, given, up, which, allowed, for, the, lender, to, charge, interest, to, compensate, him, for, profit, foregone, in, investing, the, money, himself, this, idea, is, very, similar, to, opportunity, cost, many, scholastic, thinkers, who, argued, for, a, ban, on, interest, charges, also, argued, for, the, legitimacy, of, lucrum, cessans, profits, for, example, pierre, jean, olivi, and, st, bernardino, of, siena, however, hostiensis, exceptions, including, for, lucrum, cessans, were, never, accepted, as, official, by, the, roman, catholic, church, the, westminster, confession, of, faith, a, confession, of, faith, upheld, by, the, reformed, churches, teaches, that, usury, defined, as, charging, interest, at, any, rate, is, a, sin, prohibited, by, the, eighth, commandment, the, roman, catholic, church, has, always, condemned, usury, but, in, modern, times, with, the, rise, of, capitalism, and, the, disestablishment, of, the, catholic, church, in, majority, catholic, countries, this, prohibition, on, usury, has, not, been, enforced, pope, benedict, xiv, s, encyclical, vix, pervenit, gives, the, reasons, why, usury, is, sinful, the, nature, of, the, sin, called, usury, has, its, proper, place, and, origin, in, a, loan, contract, demands, by, its, very, nature, that, one, return, to, another, only, as, much, as, he, has, received, the, sin, rests, on, the, fact, that, sometimes, the, creditor, desires, more, than, he, has, given, but, any, gain, which, exceeds, the, amount, he, gave, is, illicit, and, usurious, one, cannot, condone, the, sin, of, usury, by, arguing, that, the, gain, is, not, great, or, excessive, but, rather, moderate, or, small, neither, can, it, be, condoned, by, arguing, that, the, borrower, is, rich, nor, even, by, arguing, that, the, money, borrowed, is, not, left, idle, but, is, spent, usefully, the, congregation, of, the, missionary, sons, of, the, immaculate, heart, of, mary, a, catholic, christian, religious, order, thus, teaches, that, it, might, initially, seem, like, little, is, at, stake, when, it, comes, to, interest, but, this, is, an, issue, of, human, dignity, a, person, is, made, in, god, s, own, image, and, therefore, may, never, be, treated, as, a, thing, interest, can, diminish, the, human, person, to, a, thing, to, be, manipulated, for, money, in, an, article, for, the, catholic, worker, dorothy, day, articulated, this, well, can, i, talk, about, the, people, living, off, usury, not, knowing, the, way, that, their, infertile, money, has, bred, more, money, by, wise, investment, in, god, knows, what, devilish, nerve, gas, drugs, napalm, missiles, or, vanities, when, housing, and, employment, for, the, poor, were, needed, and, money, could, have, been, invested, there, her, thoughts, were, a, precursor, to, what, pope, francis, now, calls, an, economy, that, kills, to, sin, is, to, say, no, to, god, and, god, s, presence, by, harming, others, ourselves, or, all, of, creation, charging, interest, is, indeed, sinful, when, doing, so, takes, advantage, of, a, person, in, need, as, well, as, when, it, means, investing, in, corporations, involved, in, the, harming, of, god, s, creatures
