women, s, rights, are, the, rights, and, entitlements, claimed, for, women, and, girls, worldwide, they, formed, the, basis, for, the, women, s, rights, movement, in, the, 19th, century, and, the, feminist, movements, during, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, in, some, countries, these, rights, are, institutionalized, or, supported, by, law, local, custom, and, behavior, whereas, in, others, they, are, ignored, and, suppressed, they, differ, from, broader, notions, of, human, rights, through, claims, of, an, inherent, historical, and, traditional, bias, against, the, exercise, of, rights, by, women, and, girls, in, favor, of, men, and, boys, issues, commonly, associated, with, notions, of, women, s, rights, include, the, right, to, bodily, integrity, and, autonomy, to, be, free, from, sexual, violence, to, vote, to, hold, public, office, to, enter, into, legal, contracts, to, have, equal, rights, in, family, law, to, work, to, fair, wages, or, equal, pay, to, have, reproductive, rights, to, own, property, and, to, education, women, in, ancient, sumer, could, buy, own, sell, and, inherit, property, they, could, engage, in, commerce, and, testify, in, court, as, witnesses, nonetheless, their, husbands, could, divorce, them, for, mild, infractions, and, a, divorced, husband, could, easily, remarry, another, woman, provided, that, his, first, wife, had, borne, him, no, offspring, female, deities, such, as, inanna, were, widely, worshipped, 182, the, akkadian, poet, enheduanna, the, priestess, of, inanna, and, daughter, of, sargon, is, the, earliest, known, poet, whose, name, has, been, recorded, old, babylonian, law, codes, permitted, a, husband, to, divorce, his, wife, under, any, circumstances, 140, but, doing, so, required, him, to, return, all, of, her, property, and, sometimes, pay, her, a, fine, 140, most, law, codes, forbade, a, woman, to, request, her, husband, for, a, divorce, and, enforced, the, same, penalties, on, a, woman, asking, for, divorce, as, on, a, woman, caught, in, the, act, of, adultery, 140, some, babylonian, and, assyrian, laws, however, afforded, women, the, same, right, to, divorce, as, men, requiring, them, to, pay, the, same, fine, 140, the, majority, of, east, semitic, deities, were, male, 179, in, ancient, egypt, women, enjoyed, the, same, rights, under, the, law, as, a, man, however, rightful, entitlements, depended, upon, social, class, landed, property, descended, in, the, female, line, from, mother, to, daughter, and, women, were, entitled, to, administer, their, own, property, women, in, ancient, egypt, could, buy, sell, be, a, partner, in, legal, contracts, be, executors, in, wills, and, witnesses, to, legal, documents, bring, court, action, and, adopt, children, women, during, the, early, vedic, period, enjoyed, equal, status, with, men, in, all, aspects, of, life, works, by, ancient, indian, grammarians, such, as, patanjali, and, katyayana, suggest, that, women, were, educated, in, the, early, vedic, period, rigvedic, verses, suggest, that, women, married, at, a, mature, age, and, were, probably, free, to, select, their, own, husbands, in, a, practice, called, swayamvar, or, live, in, relationship, called, gandharva, marriage, although, most, women, lacked, political, and, equal, rights, in, the, city, states, of, ancient, greece, they, enjoyed, a, certain, freedom, of, movement, until, the, archaic, age, records, also, exist, of, women, in, ancient, delphi, gortyn, thessaly, megara, and, sparta, owning, land, the, most, prestigious, form, of, private, property, at, the, time, however, after, the, archaic, age, legislators, began, to, enact, laws, enforcing, gender, segregation, resulting, in, decreased, rights, for, women, women, in, classical, athens, had, no, legal, personhood, and, were, assumed, to, be, part, of, the, oikos, headed, by, the, male, kyrios, until, marriage, women, were, under, the, guardianship, of, their, father, or, another, male, relative, once, married, the, husband, became, a, woman, s, kyrios, as, women, were, barred, from, conducting, legal, proceedings, the, kyrios, would, do, so, on, their, behalf, athenian, women, could, only, acquire, rights, over, property, through, gifts, dowry, and, inheritance, though, her, kyrios, had, the, right, to, dispose, of, a, woman, s, property, athenian, women, could, only, enter, into, a, contract, worth, less, than, the, value, of, a, medimnos, of, barley, a, measure, of, grain, allowing, women, to, engage, in, petty, trading, women, were, excluded, from, ancient, athenian, democracy, both, in, principle, and, in, practice, slaves, could, become, athenian, citizens, after, being, freed, but, no, woman, ever, acquired, citizenship, in, ancient, athens, in, classical, athens, women, were, also, barred, from, becoming, poets, scholars, politicians, or, artists, during, the, hellenistic, period, in, athens, the, philosopher, aristotle, thought, that, women, would, bring, disorder, and, evil, therefore, it, was, best, to, keep, women, separate, from, the, rest, of, the, society, this, separation, would, entail, living, in, a, room, called, a, gynaikeion, while, looking, after, the, duties, in, the, home, and, having, very, little, exposure, to, the, male, world, this, was, also, to, ensure, that, wives, only, had, legitimate, children, from, their, husbands, athenian, women, received, little, education, except, home, tutorship, for, basic, skills, such, as, spinning, weaving, cooking, and, some, knowledge, of, money, although, spartan, women, were, formally, excluded, from, military, and, political, life, they, enjoyed, considerable, status, as, mothers, of, spartan, warriors, as, men, engaged, in, military, activity, women, took, responsibility, for, running, estates, following, protracted, warfare, in, the, 4th, century, bc, spartan, women, owned, approximately, between, 35, and, 40, of, all, spartan, land, and, property, by, the, hellenistic, period, some, of, the, wealthiest, spartans, were, women, spartan, women, controlled, their, own, properties, as, well, as, the, properties, of, male, relatives, who, were, away, with, the, army, girls, as, well, as, boys, received, an, education, but, despite, relatively, greater, freedom, of, movement, for, spartan, women, their, role, in, politics, was, the, same, as, athenian, women, plato, acknowledged, that, extending, civil, and, political, rights, to, women, would, substantively, alter, the, nature, of, the, household, and, the, state, aristotle, who, had, been, taught, by, plato, denied, that, women, were, slaves, or, subject, to, property, arguing, that, nature, has, distinguished, between, the, female, and, the, slave, but, he, considered, wives, to, be, bought, he, argued, that, women, s, main, economic, activity, is, that, of, safeguarding, the, household, property, created, by, men, according, to, aristotle, the, labour, of, women, added, no, value, because, the, art, of, household, management, is, not, identical, with, the, art, of, getting, wealth, for, the, one, uses, the, material, which, the, other, provides, contrary, to, plato, s, views, the, stoic, philosophers, argued, for, equality, of, the, sexes, sexual, inequality, being, in, their, view, contrary, to, the, laws, of, nature, in, doing, so, they, followed, the, cynics, who, argued, that, men, and, women, should, wear, the, same, clothing, and, receive, the, same, kind, of, education, they, also, saw, marriage, as, a, moral, companionship, between, equals, rather, than, a, biological, or, social, necessity, and, practiced, these, views, in, their, lives, as, well, as, their, teachings, the, stoics, adopted, the, views, of, the, cynics, and, added, them, to, their, own, theories, of, human, nature, thus, putting, their, sexual, egalitarianism, on, a, strong, philosophical, basis, roman, law, similar, to, athenian, law, was, created, by, men, in, favor, of, men, women, had, no, public, voice, and, no, public, role, which, only, improved, after, the, 1st, century, to, the, 6th, century, bce, freeborn, women, of, ancient, rome, were, citizens, who, enjoyed, legal, privileges, and, protections, that, did, not, extend, to, non, citizens, or, slaves, roman, society, however, was, patriarchal, and, women, could, not, vote, hold, public, office, or, serve, in, the, military, women, of, the, upper, classes, exercised, political, influence, through, marriage, and, motherhood, during, the, roman, republic, the, mothers, of, the, gracchus, brothers, and, of, julius, caesar, were, noted, as, exemplary, women, who, advanced, the, careers, of, their, sons, during, the, imperial, period, women, of, the, emperor, s, family, could, acquire, considerable, political, power, and, were, regularly, depicted, in, official, art, and, on, coinage, the, central, core, of, roman, society, was, the, pater, familias, or, the, male, head, of, the, household, who, exercised, his, authority, over, all, his, children, servants, and, wife, girls, had, equal, inheritance, rights, with, boys, if, their, father, died, without, leaving, a, will, similar, to, athenian, women, roman, women, had, a, guardian, or, as, it, was, called, tutor, who, managed, and, oversaw, all, her, activity, this, tutelage, had, limited, female, activity, but, by, the, first, century, to, sixth, century, bce, tutelage, became, very, relaxed, and, women, were, accepted, to, participate, in, more, public, roles, such, as, owning, and, managing, property, or, acting, as, municipal, patrons, for, gladiator, games, and, other, entertainment, activities, childbearing, was, encouraged, by, the, state, by, 27, 14, bce, the, ius, tritium, liberorum, legal, right, of, three, children, granted, symbolic, honors, and, legal, privileges, to, a, woman, who, had, given, birth, to, three, children, and, freed, her, from, any, male, guardianship, in, the, earliest, period, of, the, roman, republic, a, bride, passed, from, her, father, s, control, into, the, hand, manus, of, her, husband, she, then, became, subject, to, her, husband, s, potestas, though, to, a, lesser, degree, than, their, children, this, archaic, form, of, manus, marriage, was, largely, abandoned, by, the, time, of, julius, caesar, when, a, woman, remained, under, her, father, s, authority, by, law, even, when, she, moved, into, her, husband, s, home, this, arrangement, was, one, of, the, factors, in, the, independence, roman, women, enjoyed, although, women, had, to, answer, to, their, fathers, in, legal, matters, they, were, free, of, his, direct, scrutiny, in, their, daily, lives, and, their, husbands, had, no, legal, power, over, them, when, a, woman, s, father, died, she, became, legally, emancipated, sui, iuris, a, married, woman, retained, ownership, of, any, property, she, brought, into, the, marriage, girls, had, equal, inheritance, rights, with, boys, if, their, father, died, without, leaving, a, will, under, classical, roman, law, a, husband, had, no, right, to, abuse, his, wife, physically, or, compel, her, to, have, sex, wife, beating, was, sufficient, grounds, for, divorce, or, other, legal, action, against, the, husband, because, of, their, legal, status, as, citizens, and, the, degree, to, which, they, could, become, emancipated, women, in, ancient, rome, could, own, property, enter, contracts, and, engage, in, business, some, acquired, and, disposed, of, sizable, fortunes, and, are, recorded, in, inscriptions, as, benefactors, in, funding, major, public, works, roman, women, could, appear, in, court, and, argue, cases, though, it, was, customary, for, them, to, be, represented, by, a, man, they, were, simultaneously, disparaged, as, too, ignorant, and, weak, minded, to, practice, law, and, as, too, active, and, influential, in, legal, matters, resulting, in, an, edict, that, limited, women, to, conducting, cases, on, their, own, behalf, instead, of, others, but, even, after, this, restriction, was, put, in, place, there, are, numerous, examples, of, women, taking, informed, actions, in, legal, matters, including, dictating, legal, strategy, to, their, male, advocates, roman, law, recognized, rape, as, a, crime, in, which, the, victim, bore, no, guilt, and, a, capital, crime, the, rape, of, a, woman, was, considered, an, attack, on, her, family, and, father, s, honour, and, rape, victims, were, shamed, for, allowing, the, bad, name, in, her, father, s, honour, as, a, matter, of, law, rape, could, be, committed, only, against, a, citizen, in, good, standing, the, rape, of, a, slave, could, be, prosecuted, only, as, damage, to, her, owner, s, property, the, first, roman, emperor, augustus, framed, his, ascent, to, sole, power, as, a, return, to, traditional, morality, and, attempted, to, regulate, the, conduct, of, women, through, moral, legislation, adultery, which, had, been, a, private, family, matter, under, the, republic, was, criminalized, and, defined, broadly, as, an, illicit, sex, act, stuprum, that, occurred, between, a, male, citizen, and, a, married, woman, or, between, a, married, woman, and, any, man, other, than, her, husband, therefore, a, married, woman, could, have, sex, only, with, her, husband, but, a, married, man, did, not, commit, adultery, when, he, had, sex, with, a, prostitute, slave, or, person, of, marginalized, status, infamis, most, prostitutes, in, ancient, rome, were, slaves, though, some, slaves, were, protected, from, forced, prostitution, by, a, clause, in, their, sales, contract, a, free, woman, who, worked, as, a, prostitute, or, entertainer, lost, her, social, standing, and, became, infamis, disreputable, by, making, her, body, publicly, available, she, had, in, effect, surrendered, her, right, to, be, protected, from, sexual, abuse, or, physical, violence, stoic, philosophies, influenced, the, development, of, roman, law, stoics, of, the, imperial, era, such, as, seneca, and, musonius, rufus, developed, theories, of, just, relationships, while, not, advocating, equality, in, society, or, under, the, law, they, held, that, nature, gives, men, and, women, equal, capacity, for, virtue, and, equal, obligations, to, act, virtuously, and, that, therefore, men, and, women, had, an, equal, need, for, philosophical, education, these, philosophical, trends, among, the, ruling, elite, are, thought, to, have, helped, improve, the, status, of, women, under, the, empire, rome, had, no, system, of, state, supported, schooling, and, education, was, available, only, to, those, who, could, pay, for, it, the, daughters, of, senators, and, knights, seem, to, have, regularly, received, a, primary, education, for, ages, 7, to, 12, regardless, of, gender, few, people, were, educated, beyond, that, level, girls, from, a, modest, background, might, be, schooled, in, order, to, help, with, the, family, business, or, to, acquire, literacy, skills, that, enabled, them, to, work, as, scribes, and, secretaries, the, woman, who, achieved, the, greatest, prominence, in, the, ancient, world, for, her, learning, was, hypatia, of, alexandria, who, taught, advanced, courses, to, young, men, and, advised, the, roman, prefect, of, egypt, on, politics, her, influence, put, her, into, conflict, with, the, bishop, of, alexandria, cyril, who, may, have, been, implicated, in, her, violent, death, in, the, year, 415, at, the, hands, of, a, christian, mob, since, byzantine, law, was, essentially, based, on, roman, law, the, legal, status, of, women, did, not, change, significantly, from, the, practices, of, the, 6th, century, but, the, traditional, restriction, of, women, in, public, life, as, well, as, the, hostility, against, independent, women, still, continued, greater, influence, of, greek, culture, contributed, to, strict, attitudes, about, women, s, roles, being, domestic, instead, of, being, public, there, was, also, a, growing, trend, of, women, who, were, not, prostitutes, slaves, or, entertainers, to, be, entirely, veiled, like, previous, roman, law, women, could, not, be, legal, witnesses, hold, administrations, or, run, banking, but, they, could, still, inherit, properties, and, own, land, as, a, rule, the, influence, of, the, church, was, exercised, in, favor, of, the, abolition, of, the, disabilities, imposed, by, the, older, law, upon, celibacy, and, childlessness, of, increased, facilities, for, entering, a, professed, religious, life, and, of, due, provision, for, the, wife, the, church, also, supported, the, political, power, of, those, who, were, friendly, toward, the, clergy, the, appointment, of, mothers, and, grandmothers, as, tutors, was, sanctioned, by, justinian, the, restrictions, on, the, marriage, of, senators, and, other, men, of, high, rank, with, women, of, low, rank, were, extended, by, constantine, but, it, was, almost, entirely, removed, by, justinian, second, marriages, were, discouraged, especially, by, making, it, legal, to, impose, a, condition, that, a, widow, s, right, to, property, should, cease, on, remarriage, and, the, leonine, constitutions, at, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, made, third, marriages, punishable, the, same, constitutions, made, the, benediction, of, a, priest, a, necessary, part, of, the, ceremony, of, marriage, women, throughout, historical, and, ancient, china, were, considered, inferior, and, had, subordinate, legal, status, based, on, confucian, law, in, imperial, china, the, three, obediences, promoted, daughters, to, obey, their, fathers, wives, to, obey, their, husbands, and, widows, to, obey, their, sons, women, could, not, inherit, businesses, or, wealth, and, men, had, to, adopt, a, son, for, such, financial, purposes, late, imperial, law, also, featured, seven, different, types, of, divorces, a, wife, could, be, ousted, if, she, failed, to, birth, a, son, committed, adultery, disobeyed, her, parents, in, law, spoke, excessively, stole, was, given, to, bouts, of, jealousy, or, suffered, from, an, incurable, or, loathsome, disease, or, disorder, but, there, were, also, limits, for, the, husband, for, example, he, could, not, divorce, if, she, observed, her, parents, in, law, s, mourning, sites, if, she, had, no, family, to, return, to, or, if, the, husband, s, family, used, to, be, poor, and, since, then, had, become, richer, confucian, thinking, relegated, women, in, china, to, subordinate, roles, and, foot, binding, left, them, homemakers, about, 45, of, chinese, women, had, bound, feet, in, the, 19th, century, for, the, upper, classes, it, was, almost, 100, in, 1912, the, chinese, government, ordered, the, cessation, of, foot, binding, foot, binding, involved, the, alteration, of, the, bone, structure, so, that, the, feet, were, only, about, four, inches, long, the, bound, feet, caused, difficulty, in, movement, thus, greatly, limiting, the, activities, of, women, due, to, the, social, custom, that, men, and, women, should, not, be, near, each, other, the, women, of, china, were, reluctant, to, be, treated, by, male, doctors, of, western, medicine, this, resulted, in, a, tremendous, need, for, female, doctors, of, western, medicine, in, china, thus, female, medical, missionary, mary, h, fulton, 1854, 1927, was, sent, by, the, foreign, missions, board, of, the, presbyterian, church, usa, to, found, the, first, medical, college, for, women, in, china, known, as, the, hackett, medical, college, for, women,

modern, medicine, and, the, elevation, of, chinese, women, s, social, status, during, the, republic, of, china, 1912, 49, and, earlier, chinese, governments, women, were, legally, bought, and, sold, into, slavery, under, the, guise, of, domestic, servants, these, women, were, known, as, mui, tsai, the, lives, of, mui, tsai, were, recorded, by, american, feminist, agnes, smedley, in, her, book, portraits, of, chinese, women, in, revolution, however, in, 1949, the, republic, of, china, was, overthrown, by, communist, guerillas, led, by, mao, zedong, and, the, people, s, republic, of, china, was, founded, in, the, same, year, in, may, 1950, the, people, s, republic, of, china, enacted, the, new, marriage, law, to, tackle, the, sale, of, women, into, slavery, this, outlawed, marriage, by, proxy, and, made, marriage, legal, so, long, as, both, partners, consent, the, new, marriage, law, raised, the, legal, age, of, marriage, to, 20, for, men, and, 18, for, women, this, was, an, essential, part, of, countryside, land, reform, as, women, could, no, longer, legally, be, sold, to, landlords, the, official, slogan, was, men, and, women, are, equal, everyone, is, worth, his, or, her, salt, both, before, and, during, biblical, times, the, roles, of, women, in, society, were, severely, restricted, nonetheless, in, the, bible, women, are, depicted, as, having, the, right, to, represent, themselves, in, court, 56, 62, the, ability, to, make, contracts, 63, 67, and, the, rights, to, purchase, own, sell, and, inherit, property, 63, 80, the, bible, guarantees, women, the, right, to, sex, with, their, husbands, and, orders, husbands, to, feed, and, clothe, their, wives, breach, of, these, old, testament, rights, by, a, polygamous, man, gave, the, woman, grounds, for, divorce, if, he, marries, another, woman, he, must, not, deprive, the, first, one, of, her, food, clothing, and, marital, rights, if, he, does, not, provide, her, with, these, three, things, she, is, to, go, free, without, any, payment, of, money, exodus, 21, 10, 11, the, qur, an, which, muslims, believe, was, revealed, to, muhammad, over, the, course, of, 23, years, provided, guidance, to, the, islamic, community, and, modified, existing, customs, in, arab, society, the, qur, an, prescribes, limited, rights, for, women, in, marriage, divorce, and, inheritance, by, providing, that, the, wife, not, her, family, would, receive, a, dowry, from, the, husband, which, she, could, administer, as, her, personal, property, the, qur, an, made, women, a, legal, party, to, the, marriage, contract, while, in, customary, law, inheritance, was, often, limited, to, male, descendants, the, qur, an, included, rules, on, inheritance, with, certain, fixed, shares, being, distributed, to, designated, heirs, first, to, the, nearest, female, relatives, and, then, the, nearest, male, relatives, according, to, annemarie, schimmel, compared, to, the, pre, islamic, position, of, women, islamic, legislation, meant, an, enormous, progress, the, woman, has, the, right, at, least, according, to, the, letter, of, the, law, to, administer, the, wealth, she, has, brought, into, the, family, or, has, earned, by, her, own, work, for, arab, women, islam, included, the, prohibition, of, female, infanticide, and, recognizing, women, s, full, personhood, women, generally, gained, greater, rights, than, women, in, pre, islamic, arabia, and, medieval, europe, women, were, not, accorded, such, legal, status, in, other, cultures, until, centuries, later, according, to, professor, william, montgomery, watt, when, seen, in, such, a, historical, context, muhammad, can, be, seen, as, a, figure, who, testified, on, behalf, of, women, s, rights, women, s, rights, were, protected, already, by, the, early, medieval, christian, church, one, of, the, first, formal, legal, provisions, for, the, right, of, wives, was, promulgated, by, council, of, adge, in, 506, which, in, canon, xvi, stipulated, that, if, a, young, married, man, wished, to, be, ordained, he, required, the, consent, of, his, wife, the, english, church, and, culture, in, the, middle, ages, regarded, women, as, weak, irrational, vulnerable, to, temptation, and, constantly, needing, to, be, kept, in, check, this, was, reflected, on, the, christian, culture, in, england, through, the, story, of, adam, and, eve, where, eve, fell, to, satan, s, temptations, and, led, adam, to, eat, the, apple, this, belief, was, based, on, st, paul, that, the, pain, of, childbirth, was, a, punishment, for, this, deed, that, led, mankind, to, be, banished, from, the, garden, of, eden, women, s, inferiority, also, appears, in, much, medieval, writing, for, example, the, 1200, ad, theologian, jacques, de, vitry, who, was, rather, sympathetic, to, women, over, others, emphasized, female, obedience, towards, their, men, and, described, women, as, slippery, weak, untrustworthy, devious, deceitful, and, stubborn, the, church, also, promoted, the, virgin, mary, as, a, role, model, for, women, to, emulate, by, being, innocent, in, her, sexuality, being, married, to, a, husband, and, eventually, becoming, a, mother, that, was, the, core, purpose, set, out, both, culturally, and, religiously, across, medieval, europe, rape, was, also, seen, in, medieval, england, as, a, crime, against, the, father, or, husband, and, a, violation, of, their, protection, and, guardianship, of, the, women, whom, they, look, after, in, the, household, women, s, identities, in, the, middle, ages, were, also, referred, through, their, relations, with, men, they, associated, with, such, as, his, daughter, or, so, and, so, s, wife, despite, all, this, the, church, still, emphasized, the, importance, of, love, and, mutual, counselling, within, marriage, and, prohibited, any, form, of, divorce, so, the, wife, would, have, someone, to, look, after, her, in, overall, europe, during, the, middle, ages, women, were, inferior, to, men, in, legal, status, throughout, medieval, europe, women, were, pressured, to, not, attend, courts, and, leave, all, legal, business, affairs, to, their, husbands, in, the, legal,

witnesses, in, courts, in, welsh, law, women, s, testimony, could, be, accepted, towards, other, women, but, not, against, men, but, welsh, laws, specifically, the, laws, of, hywel, dda, also, reflected, accountability, for, men, to, pay, child, maintenance, for, children, born, out, of, wedlock, which, empowered, women, to, claim, rightful, payment, in, france, women, s, testimony, had, to, corroborate, with, other, accounts, or, it, would, not, be, accepted, although, women, were, expected, to, not, attend, courts, this, however, was, not, always, true, sometimes, regardless, of, expectations, women, did, participate, and, attend, court, cases, and, court, meetings, but, women, could, not, act, as, justices, in, courts, be, attorneys, or, members, of, a, jury, or, accuse, another, person, of, a, felony, unless, it, was, the, murder, of, her, husband, for, the, most, part, the, best, thing, a, woman, could, do, in, medieval, courts, was, to, observe, the, legal, proceedings, taking, place, swedish, law, protected, women, from, the, authority, of, their, husbands, by, transferring, the, authority, to, their, male, relatives, a, wife, s, property, and, land,

her, family, or, kinsman, s, consent, either, in, swedish, law, a, woman, would, also, only, get, half, that, of, her, brother, in, inheritance, despite, these, legal, issues, sweden, was, largely, ahead, and, much, superior, in, its, treatment, towards, women, than, most, european, countries, medieval, marriages, among, the, elites, were, arranged, in, a, way, that, would, meet, the, interests, of, the, family, as, a, whole, theoretically, a, woman, needed, to, consent, before, a, marriage, took, place, and, the, church, encouraged, this, consent, to, be, expressed, in, present, tense, and, not, future, marriage, could, also, take, place, anywhere, and, the, minimum, age, for, girls, was, 12, while, it, was, 14, for, boys, the, rate, of, wergild, suggested, that, women, in, these, societies, were, valued, mostly, for, their, breeding, purposes, the, wergild, of, woman, was, double, that, of, a, man, with, the, same, status, in, the, aleman, and, bavarian, legal, codes, the, wergild, of, a, woman, meanwhile, was, triple, that, of, a, man, with, the, same, status, in, salic, and, repuarian, legal, codes, for, women, of, child, bearing, age, which, constituted, from, 12, to, 40, years, old, one, of, the, most, germanic, codes, from, the, lombard, tradition, legislated, that, women, be, under, the, control, of, a, male, mundoald, which, constituted, her, father, husband, older, son, or, eventually, the, king, as, a, last, resort, if, she, had, no, male, relatives, a, woman, needed, her, mundold, s, permission, to, manage, property, but, still, could, own, her, own, lands, and, goods, certain, areas, with, visigothic, inheritance, laws, until, the, 7th, century, were, favorable, to, women, while, all, other, laws, were, not, before, the, christianization, of, europe, there, was, little, space, for, women, s, consent, for, marriage, and, marriage, through, purchase, or, kaufehe, was, actually, the, civil, norm, as, opposed, to, the, alternative, marriage, through, capture, or, raubehe, however, christianity, was, slow, to, reach, other, baltic, and, scandinavian, areas, with, it, only, reaching, king, harald, bluetooth, of, denmark, in, the, year, 950, ad, those, living, under, norwegian, and, icelandic, laws, used, marriages, to, forge, alliances, or, create, peace, usually, without, the, women, s, say, or, consent, however, divorce, rights, were, permitted, to, women, who, suffered, physical, abuse, but, protections, from, harm, were, not, given, to, those, termed, wretched, women, such, as, beggars, servants, and, slave, women, having, sex, with, them, through, force, or, without, consent, usually, had, no, legal, consequence, or, punishment, during, the, viking, age, women, had, a, relatively, free,

woman, with, no, son, could, furthermore, inherit, not, only, property, but, also, the, position, as, head, of, the, family, from, a, deceased, father, or, brother, a, woman, with, such, status, was, referred, to, as, ringkvinna, and, she, exercised, all, the, rights, afforded, to, the, head, of, a, family, clan, such, as, the, right, to, demand, and, receive, fines, for, the, slaughter, of, a, family, member, unless, she, married, by, which, her, rights, were, transferred, to, her, husband, after, the, age, of, 20, an, unmarried, woman, referred, to, as, maer, and, mey, reached, legal,

marriage, partner, as, marriages, were, normally, arranged, by, the, clan, widows, enjoyed, the, same, independent, status, as, unmarried, women, women, had, religious, authority, and, were, active, as, priestesses, gydja, and, oracles, sejdkvinna, within, art, as, poets, skalder, and, rune, masters, and, as, merchants, and, medicine, women, they, may, also, have, been, active, within, military, office, the, stories, about, shieldmaidens, are, unconfirmed, but, some, archaeological, finds, such, as, the, birka, female, viking, warrior, may, indicate, that, at, least, some, women, in, military, authority, existed, a, married, woman, could, divorce, her, husband, and, remarry, it, was, also, socially, acceptable, for, a, free, woman, to, cohabit, with, a, man, and, have, children, with, him, without, marrying, him, even, if, that, man, was, married, a, woman, in, such, a, position, was, called, frilla, there, was, no, distinction, made, between, children, born, inside, or, outside, of, marriage, both, had, the, right, to, inherit, property, after, their, parents, and, there, were, no, legitimate, or, illegitimate, children, these, liberties, gradually, disappeared, after, the, introduction, of, christianity, and, from, the, late, 13th, century, they, are, no, longer, mentioned, during, the, christian, middle, ages, the, medieval, scandinavian, law, applied, different, laws, depending, on, the, local, county, law, signifying, that, the, status, of, women, could, vary, depending, on, which, county, she, was, living, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, saw, numerous, witch, trials, which, resulted, in, thousands, of, people, across, europe, being, executed, of, whom, 75, 95, were, women, depending, on, time, and, place, the, executions, mostly, took, place, in, german, speaking, lands, and, during, the, 15th, century, the, terminology, witchcraft, was, definitely, viewed, as, something, feminine, as, opposed, to, prior, years, famous, witchcraft, manuals, such, as, the, malleus, maleficarum, and, summis, desiderantes, depicted, witches, as, diabolical, conspirators, who, worshipped, satan, and, were, primarily, women, culture, and, art, at, the, time, depicted, these, witches, as, seductive, and, evil, further, fuelling, moral, panic, in, fusion, with, rhetoric, from, the, church, the, origin, of, the, female, witch, myth, traces, back, to, roman, mythical, night, creatures, known, as, strix, who, were, thought, to, appear, and, disappear, mysteriously, in, the, night, they, were, also, believed, by, many, to, be, of, transformed, women, by, their, own, supernatural, powers, this, roman, myth, itself, is, believed, to, originate, from, the, jewish, sabbath, which, described, non, supernatural, women, who, would, suspiciously, leave, and, return, home, swiftly, during, the, night, authors, of, the, malleus, maleficarum, strongly, established, the, link, between, witchcraft, and, women, by, proclaiming, a, greater, likelihood, for, women, to, be, addicted, to, evil, the, authors, and, inquisitors, heinrich, kramer, and, jacob, sprengerh, justified, these, beliefs, by, claiming, women, had, greater, credulity, impressionability, feeble, minds, feeble, bodies, impulsivity, and, carnal, natures, which, were, flaws, susceptible, to, evil, behavior, and, witchcraft, these, sorts, of, beliefs, at, the, time, could, send, female, hermits, or, beggars, to, trials, just, for, offering, remedies, or, herbal, medicine, this, set, of, developed, myths, eventually, lead, to, the, 16, 17th, century, witch, trials, which, found, thousands, of, women, burned, at, the, stake, by, 1500, europe, was, divided, into, two, types, of, secular, law, one, was, customary, law, which, was, predominant, in, northern, france, england, and, scandinavia, and, the, other, was, roman, based, written, law, which, was, predominant, in, southern, france, italy, spain, and, portugal, customary, laws, favoured, men, more, than, women, for, example, inheritance, among, the, elites, in, italy, england, scandinavia, and, france, was, passed, on, to, the, eldest, male, heir, in, all, of, the, regions, the, laws, also, gave, men, substantial, powers, over, the, lives, property, and, bodies, of, their, wives, however, there, were, some, improvements, for, women, as, opposed, to, ancient, custom, for, example, they, could, inherit, in, the, absence, of, their, brothers, do, certain, trades, without, their, husbands, and, widows, could, receive, dower, in, areas, governed, by, roman, based, written, laws, women, were, under, male, guardianship, in, matters, involving, property, and, law, with, fathers, overseeing, daughters, husbands, overseeing, wives, and, uncles, or, male, relatives, overseeing, widows, throughout, europe, women, s, legal, status, centered, around, their, marital, status, while, marriage, itself, was, the, biggest, factor, in, restricting, women, s, autonomy, custom, statute, and, practice, not, only, reduced, women, s, rights, and, freedoms, but, prevented, single, or, widowed, women, from, holding, public, office, on, the, justification, that, they, might, one, day, marry, according, to, english, common, law, which, developed, from, the, 12th, century, onward, all, property, which, a, wife, held, at, the, time, of, marriage, became, a, possession, of, her, husband, eventually, english, courts, forbade, a, husband, s, transferring, property, without, the, consent, of, his, wife, but, he, still, retained, the, right, to, manage, it, and, to, receive, the, money, which, it, produced, french, married, women, suffered, from, restrictions, on, their, legal, capacity, which, were, removed, only, in, 1965, in, the, 16th, century, the, reformation, in, europe, allowed, more, women, to, add, their, voices, including, the, english, writers, jane, anger, aemilia, lanyer, and, the, prophetess, anna, trapnell, english, and, american, quakers, believed, that, men, and, women, were, equal, many, quaker, women, were, preachers, despite, relatively, greater, freedom, for, anglo, saxon, women, until, the, mid, 19th, century, writers, largely, assumed, that, a, patriarchal, order, was, a, natural, order, that, had, always, existed, this, perception, was, not, seriously, challenged, until, the, 18th, century, when, jesuit, missionaries, found, matrilineality, in, native, north, american, peoples, the, philosopher, john, locke, opposed, marital, inequality, and, the, mistreatment, of, women, during, this, time, he, was, well, known, for, advocating, for, marital, equality, among, the, sexes, in, his, work, during, the, 17th, century, according, to, a, study, published, in, the, american, journal, of, social, issues, humanities, the, condition, for, women, during, locke, s, time, were, as, quote, other, philosophers, have, also, made, statements, regarding, women, s, rights, during, this, time, for, example, thomas, paine, wrote, in, an, occasional, letter, on, the, female, sex, 1775, where, he, states, as, quote, if, we, take, a, survey, of, ages, and, of, countries, we, shall, find, the, women, almost, without, exception, adored, and, oppressed, they, are, robbed, of, freedom, of, will, by, the, laws, yet, such, i, am, sorry, to, say, is, the, lot, of, women, over, the, whole, earth, man, with, regard, to, them, has, been, either, an, insensible, husband, or, an, oppressor, a, paternal, society, can, find, prefer, to, make, women, s, rights, a, man, s, duty, for, instance, under, english, common, law, husbands, had, to, maintain, their, wives, this, duty, was, abolished, in, 2010, starting, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, throughout, the, 19th, century, rights, as, a, concept, and, claim, gained, increasing, political, social, and, philosophical, importance, in, europe, movements, emerged, which, demanded, freedom, of, religion, the, abolition, of, slavery, rights, for, women, rights, for, those, who, did, not, own, property, and, universal, suffrage, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, question, of, women, s, rights, became, central, to, political, debates, in, both, france, and, britain, at, the, time, some, of, the, greatest, thinkers, of, the, enlightenment, who, defended, democratic, principles, of, equality, and, challenged, notions, that, a, privileged, few, should, rule, over, the, vast, majority, of, the, population, believed, that, these, principles, should, be, applied, only, to, their, own, gender, and, their, own, race, the, philosopher, jean, jacques, rousseau, for, example, thought, that, it, was, the, order, of, nature, for, women, to, obey, men, he, wrote, women, do, wrong, to, complain, of, the, inequality, of, man, made, laws, and, claimed, that, when, she, tries, to, usurp, our, rights, she, is, our, inferior, in, 1754, dorothea, erxleben, became, the, first, german, woman, receiving, a, m, d, university, of, halle, in, 1791, the, french, playwright, and, political, activist, olympe, de, gouges, published, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, of, the, female, citizen, modelled, on, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, of, 1789, the, declaration, is, ironic, in, formulation, and, exposes, the, failure, of, the, french, revolution, which, had, been, devoted, to, equality, it, states, that, this, revolution, will, only, take, effect, when, all, women, become, fully, aware, of, their, deplorable, condition, and, of, the, rights, they, have, lost, in, society, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, the, female, citizen, follows, the, seventeen, articles, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, point, for, point, and, has, been, described, by, camille, naish, as, almost, a, parody, of, the, original, document, the, first, article, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, proclaims, that, men, are, born, and, remain, free, and, equal, in, rights, social, distinctions, may, be, based, only, on, common, utility, the, first, article, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, woman, and, of, the, female, citizen, replied, woman, is, born, free, and, remains, equal, to, man, in, rights, social, distinctions, may, only, be, based, on, common, utility, de, gouges, expands, the, sixth, article, of, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, which, declared, the, rights, of, citizens, to, take, part, in, the, formation, of, law, to, all, citizens, including, women, are, equally, admissible, to, all, public, dignities, offices, and, employments, according, to, their, capacity, and, with, no, other, distinction, than, that, of, their, virtues, and, talents, de, gouges, also, draws, attention, to, the, fact, that, under, french, law, women, were, fully, punishable, yet, denied, equal, rights, she, was, subsequently, sent, to, the, guillotine, mary, wollstonecraft, a, british, writer, and, philosopher, published, a, vindication, of, the, rights, of, woman, in, 1792, arguing, that, it, was, the, education, and, upbringing, of, women, that, created, limited, expectations, wollstonecraft, attacked, gender, oppression, pressing, for, equal, educational, opportunities, and, demanded, justice, and, rights, to, humanity, for, all, wollstonecraft, along, with, her, british, contemporaries, damaris, cudworth, and, catharine, macaulay, started, to, use, the, language, of, rights, in, relation, to, women, arguing, that, women, should, have, greater, opportunity, because, like, men, they, were, moral, and, rational, beings, mary, robinson, wrote, in, a, similar, vein, in, a, letter, to, the, women, of, england, on, the, injustice, of, mental, subordination, 1799, in, his, 1869, essay, the, subjection, of, women, the, english, philosopher, and, political, theorist, john, stuart, mill, described, the, situation, for, women, in, britain, as, follows, we, are, continually, told, that, civilization, and, christianity, have, restored, to, the, woman, her, just, rights, meanwhile, the, wife, is, the, actual, bondservant, of, her, husband, no, less, so, as, far, as, the, legal, obligation, goes, than, slaves, commonly, so, called, then, a, member, of, parliament, mill, argued, that, women, deserve, the, right, to, vote, though, his, proposal, to, replace, the, term, man, with, person, in, the, second, reform, bill, of, 1867, was, greeted, with, laughter, in, the, house, of, commons, and, defeated, by, 76, to, 196, votes, his, arguments, won, little, support, amongst, contemporaries, but, his, attempt, to, amend, the, reform, bill, generated, greater, attention, for, the, issue, of, women, s, suffrage, in, britain, initially, only, one, of, several, women, s, rights, campaigns, suffrage, became, the, primary, cause, of, the, british, women, s, movement, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, at, the, time, the, ability, to, vote, was, restricted, to, wealthy, property, owners, within, british, jurisdictions, this, arrangement, implicitly, excluded, women, as, property, law, and, marriage, law, gave, men, ownership, rights, at, marriage, or, inheritance, until, the, 19th, century, although, male, suffrage, broadened, during, the, century, women, were, explicitly, prohibited, from, voting, nationally, and, locally, in, the, 1830s, by, the, reform, act, 1832, and, the, municipal, corporations, act, 1835, millicent, fawcett, and, emmeline, pankhurst, led, the, public, campaign, on, women, s, suffrage, and, in, 1918, a, bill, was, passed, allowing, women, over, the, age, of, 30, to, vote, by, the, 1860s, the, economic, sexual, politics, of, middle, class, women, in, britain, and, its, neighboring, western, european, countries, was, guided, by, factors, such, as, the, evolution, of, 19th, century, consumer, culture, including, the, emergence, of, the, department, store, and, separate, spheres, in, come, buy, come, buy, shopping, and, the, culture, of, consumption, in, victorian, women, s, writing, krista, lysack, s, literary, analysis, of, 19th, century, contemporary, literature, claims, through, her, resources, reflection, of, common, contemporary, norms, victorian, femininity, as, characterized, by, self, renunciation, and, the, regulation, of, appetite, while, women, particularly, those, in, the, middle, class, obtained, modest, control, of, daily, household, expenses, and, had, the, ability, to, leave, the, house, attend, social, events, and, shop, for, personal, and, household, items, in, the, various, department, stores, developing, in, late, 19th, century, europe, europe, s, socioeconomic, climate, pervaded, the, ideology, that, women, were, not, in, complete, control, over, their, urges, to, spend, assuming, their, husband, or, father, s, wages, as, a, result, many, advertisements, for, socially, feminine, goods, revolved, around, upward, social, progression, exoticisms, from, the, orient, and, added, efficiency, for, household, roles, women, were, deemed, responsible, for, such, as, cleaning, childcare, and, cooking,

for, instance, enacted, women, s, suffrage, in, 1946, earlier, than, several, european, countries, such, as, switzerland, 1971, at, federal, level, 1990, on, local, issues, in, the, canton, of, appenzell, innerrhoden, portugal, 1976, on, equal, terms, with, men, with, restrictions, since, 1931, san, marino, in, 1959, monaco, in, 1962, andorra, in, 1970, and, liechtenstein, in, 1984, central, asian, cultures, largely, remain, patriarchal, however, since, the, fall, of, the, former, soviet, union, the, secular, societies, of, the, region, have, become, more, progressive, to, women, s, roles, outside, the, traditional, construct, of, being, wholly, subservient, to, men, in, mongolia, more, women, than, men, complete, school, and, are, higher, earners, as, result, the, un, development, programme, notes, significant, progress, in, gender, equality, in, kazakhstan, but, discrimination, persists, marriage, by, abduction, remains, a, serious, problem, in, this, region, the, practice, of, bride, kidnapping, is, prevalent, in, kyrgyzstan, kazakhstan, turkmenistan, and, karakalpakstan, an, autonomous, region, of, uzbekistan, the, history, of, women, s, rights, in, australia, is, a, contradictory, one, while, australia, led, the, world, in, women, s, suffrage, rights, in, the, 19th, century, it, has, been, very, slow, in, recognizing, women, s, professional, rights, it, was, not, until, 1966, that, its, marriage, bar, was, removed, on, the, other, hand, reforms, which, allowed, women, both, to, vote, and, stand, for, office, in, south, australia, in, the, late, 19th, century, were, a, cornerstone, for, women, s, political, rights, in, other, parts, of, the, world, in, this, regard, australia, differs, from, other, cultures, in, that, women, s, suffrage, in, australia, was, one, of, the, earliest, objectives, of, the, feminist, movement, there, beginning, with, south, australia, and, western, australia, unlike, other, cultures, such, as, eastern, european, cultures, where, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, feminist, movement, focused, on, labour, rights, access, to, professions, and, education, rather, than, political, rights, to, this, day, australia, has, a, quite, low, percentage, of, women, in, business, executive, roles, compared, to, other, countries, with, equivalent, corporate, structures, employment, rights, for, women, include, non, discriminatory, access, of, women, to, jobs, and, equal, pay, the, rights, of, women, and, men, to, have, equal, pay, and, equal, benefits, for, equal, work, were, openly, denied, by, the, british, hong, kong, government, up, to, the, early, 1970s, leslie, wah, leung, chung, 1917, 2009, president, of, the, hong, kong, chinese, civil, servants, association, 1965, 68, contributed, to, the, establishment, of, equal, pay, for, men, and, women, including, the, right, for, married, women, to, be, permanent, employees, before, this, the, job, status, of, a, woman, changed, from, permanent, employee, to, temporary, employee, once, she, was, married, thus, losing, the, pension, benefit, some, of, them, even, lost, their, jobs, since, nurses, were, mostly, women, this, improvement, of, the, rights, of, married, women, meant, much, to, the, nursing, profession, in, some, european, countries, married, women, could, not, work, without, the, consent, of, their, husbands, until, a, few, decades, ago, for, example, in, france, until, 1965, and, in, spain, until, 1975, in, addition, marriage, bars, a, practice, adopted, from, the, late, 19th, century, to, the, 1970s, across, many, countries, including, austria, australia, ireland, canada, and, switzerland, restricted, married, women, from, employment, in, many, professions, a, key, issue, towards, insuring, gender, equality, in, the, workplace, is, the, respecting, of, maternity, rights, and, reproductive, rights, of, women, maternity, leave, and, paternity, leave, in, some, countries, and, parental, leave, are, temporary, periods, of, absence, from, employment, granted, immediately, before, and, after, childbirth, in, order, to, support, the, mother, s, full, recovery, and, grant, time, to, care, for, the, baby, different, countries, have, different, rules, regarding, maternity, leave, paternity, leave, and, parental, leave, in, the, european, union, eu, the, policies, vary, significantly, by, country, but, the, eu, members, must, abide, by, the, minimum, standards, of, the, pregnant, workers, directive, and, work, life, balance, directive, during, the, 19th, century, some, women, began, to, ask, for, demand, and, then, agitate, and, demonstrate, for, the, right, to, vote, the, right, to, participate, in, their, government, and, its, law, making, other, women, opposed, suffrage, like, helen, kendrick, johnson, who, argued, in, the, 1897, pamphlet, woman, and, the, republic, that, women, could, achieve, legal, and, economic, equality, without, having, the, vote, the, ideals, of, women, s, suffrage, developed, alongside, that, of, universal, suffrage, and, today, women, s, suffrage, is, considered, a, right, under, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, during, the, 19th, century, the, right, to, vote, was, gradually, extended, in, many, countries, and, women, started, to, campaign, for, their, right, to, vote, in, 1893, new, zealand, became, the, first, country, to, give, women, the, right, to, vote, on, a, national, level, australia, gave, women, the, right, to, vote, in, 1902, a, number, of, nordic, countries, gave, women, the, right, to, vote, in, the, early, 20th, century, finland, 1906, norway, 1913, denmark, and, iceland, 1915, with, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, many, other, countries, followed, the, netherlands, 1917, austria, azerbaijan, canada, czechoslovakia, georgia, poland, and, sweden, 1918, germany, and, luxembourg, 1919, turkey, 1934, and, the, united, states, 1920, late, adopters, in, europe, were, greece, in, 1952, switzerland, 1971, at, federal, level, 1959, 1991, on, local, issues, at, canton, level, portugal, 1976, on, equal, terms, with, men, with, restrictions, since, 1931, as, well, as, the, microstates, of, san, marino, in, 1959, monaco, in, 1962, andorra, in, 1970, and, liechtenstein, in, 1984, in, canada, most, provinces, enacted, women, s, suffrage, between, 1917, and, 1919, late, adopters, being, prince, edward, island, in, 1922, newfoundland, in, 1925, and, quebec, in, 1940, in, latin, america, some, countries, gave, women, the, right, to, vote, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, ecuador, 1929, brazil, 1932, el, salvador, 1939, dominican, republic, 1942, guatemala, 1956, and, argentina, 1946, in, india, under, colonial, rule, universal, suffrage, was, granted, in, 1935, other, asian, countries, gave, women, the, right, to, vote, in, the, mid, 20th, century, japan, 1945, china, 1947, and, indonesia, 1955, in, africa, women, generally, got, the, right, to, vote, along, with, men, through, universal, suffrage, liberia, 1947, uganda, 1958, and, nigeria, 1960, in, many, countries, in, the, middle, east, universal, suffrage, was, acquired, after, world, war, ii, although, in, others, such, as, kuwait, suffrage, is, very, limited, on, 16, may, 2005, the, parliament, of, kuwait, extended, suffrage, to, women, by, a, 35, 23, vote, during, the, 19th, century, some, women, such, as, ernestine, rose, paulina, wright, davis, elizabeth, cady, stanton, harriet, beecher, stowe, in, the, united, states, and, britain, began, to, challenge, laws, that, denied, them, the, right, to, their, property, once, they, married, under, the, common, law, doctrine, of, coverture, husbands, gained, control, of, their, wives, real, estate, and, wages, beginning, in, the, 1840s, state, legislatures, in, the, united, states, and, the, british, parliament, began, passing, statutes, that, protected, women, s, property, from, their, husbands, and, their, husbands, creditors, these, laws, were, known, as, the, married, women, s, property, acts, courts, in, the, 19th, century, united, states, also, continued, to, require, privy, examinations, of, married, women, who, sold, their, property, a, privy, examination, was, a, practice, in, which, a, married, woman, who, wished, to, sell, her, property, had, to, be, separately, examined, by, a, judge, or, justice, of, the, peace, outside, of, the, presence, of, her, husband, and, asked, if, her, husband, was, pressuring, her, into, signing, the, document, property, rights, for, women, continued, to, be, restricted, in, many, european, countries, until, legal, reforms, of, the, 1960, 70s, for, example, in, west, germany, the, law, pertaining, to, rural, farm, succession, favored, male, heirs, until, 1963, in, the, us, head, and, master, laws, which, gave, sole, control, of, marital, property, to, the, husband, were, common, until, a, few, decades, ago, the, supreme, court, in, kirchberg, v, feenstra, 1981, declared, such, laws, unconstitutional, freedom, of, movement, is, an, essential, right, recognized, by, international, instruments, including, article, 15, 4, of, cedaw, nevertheless, in, many, regions, of, the, world, women, have, this, right, severely, restricted, in, law, or, in, practice, for, instance, in, some, countries, women, may, not, leave, the, home, without, a, male, guardian, or, without, the, consent, of, the, husband, for, example, the, personal, law, of, yemen, states, that, a, wife, must, obey, her, husband, and, must, not, get, out, of, the, home, without, his, consent, even, in, countries, which, do, not, have, legal, restrictions, women, s, movement, may, be, prevented, in, practice, by, social, and, religious, norms, such, as, purdah, laws, restricting, women, from, travelling, existed, until, relatively, recently, in, some, western, countries, until, 1983, in, australia, the, passport, application, of, a, married, woman, had, to, be, authorized, by, her, husband, several, middle, eastern, countries, also, follow, the, male, guardianship, system, in, the, modern, era, where, women, are, required, to, seek, permission, from, the, male, family, member, for, several, things, including, traveling, to, other, nations, in, august, 2019, saudi, arabia, ended, its, male, guardianship, laws, allowing, women, to, travel, by, themselves, various, practices, have, been, used, historically, to, restrict, women, s, freedom, of, movement, such, as, foot, binding, the, custom, of, applying, painfully, tight, binding, to, the, feet, of, young, chinese, girls, which, was, common, between, the, 10th, and, 20th, centuries, women, s, freedom, of, movement, may, be, restricted, by, laws, but, it, may, also, be, restricted, by, attitudes, towards, women, in, public, spaces, in, areas, where, it, is, not, socially, accepted, for, women, to, leave, the, home, women, who, are, outside, may, face, abuse, such, as, insults, sexual, harassment, and, violence, many, of, the, restrictions, on, women, s, freedom, of, movement, are, framed, as, measures, to, protect, women, the, lack, of, legal, knowledge, among, many, women, especially, in, developing, countries, is, a, major, obstacle, to, the, improvement, of, women, s, situation, international, bodies, such, as, the, united, nations, have, stated, that, the, obligation, of, states, does, not, only, consist, in, passing, relevant, laws, but, also, in, informing, women, about, the, existence, of, such, laws, in, order, to, enable, them, to, seek, justice, and, realize, in, practice, their, rights, therefore, states, must, popularize, the, laws, and, explain, them, clearly, to, the, public, in, order, to, prevent, ignorance, or, misconceptions, originating, in, popular, myths, about, the, laws, the, united, nations, development, programme, states, that, in, order, to, advance, gender, justice, women, must, know, their, rights, and, be, able, to, access, legal, systems, and, the, 1993, un, declaration, on, the, elimination, of, violence, against, women, states, at, art, 4, d, states, should, also, inform, women, of, their, rights, in, seeking, redress, through, such, mechanisms, the, united, nations, working, group, on, business, and, human, rights, wgbhr, has, stated, that, discrimination, against, women, has, historically, been, rooted, in, patriarchal, social, norms, and, power, structures, women, s, rights, movements, focus, on, ending, discrimination, against, women, in, this, regard, the, definition, of, discrimination, itself, is, important, according, to, the, jurisprudence, of, the, european, court, of, human, rights, echr, the, right, to, freedom, from, discrimination, includes, not, only, the, obligation, of, states, to, treat, in, the, same, way, persons, who, are, in, analogous, situations, but, also, the, obligation, to, treat, in, a, different, way, persons, who, are, in, different, situations, in, this, regard, equity, not, just, equality, is, important, therefore, states, must, sometimes, differentiate, between, women, and, men, through, for, example, offering, maternity, leave, or, other, legal, protections, surrounding, pregnancy, and, childbirth, to, take, into, account, the, biological, realities, of, reproduction, or, through, acknowledging, a, specific, historical, context, for, example, acts, of, violence, committed, by, men, against, women, do, not, happen, in, a, vacuum, but, are, part, of, a, social, context, in, opuz, v, turkey, the, echr, defined, violence, against, women, as, a, form, of, discrimination, against, women, this, is, also, the, position, of, the, istanbul, convention, which, at, article, 3, states, that, violence, against, women, is, understood, as, a, violation, of, human, rights, and, a, form, of, discrimination, against, women, there, are, different, views, on, where, it, is, appropriate, to, differentiate, between, women, and, men, and, one, view, is, that, the, act, of, sexual, intercourse, is, an, act, where, this, difference, must, be, acknowledged, both, due, to, the, increased, physical, risks, for, the, woman, and, due, to, the, historical, context, of, women, being, systematically, subjected, to, forced, sexual, intercourse, while, in, a, socially, subordinated, position, particularly, within, marriage, and, during, war, states, must, also, differentiate, with, regard, to, healthcare, by, ensuring, that, women, s, health, particularly, with, regard, to, reproductive, health, such, as, pregnancy, and, childbirth, is, not, neglected, according, to, the, world, health, organization, discrimination, in, health, care, settings, takes, many, forms, and, is, often, manifested, when, an, individual, or, group, is, denied, access, to, health, care, services, that, are, otherwise, available, to, others, it, can, also, occur, through, denial, of, services, that, are, only, needed, by, certain, groups, such, as, women, the, refusal, of, states, to, acknowledge, the, specific, needs, of, women, such, as, the, necessity, of, specific, policies, like, the, strong, investment, of, states, in, reducing, maternal, mortality, can, be, a, form, of, discrimination, in, this, regard, treating, women, and, men, similarly, does, not, work, because, certain, biological, aspects, such, as, menstruation, pregnancy, labor, childbirth, and, breastfeeding, as, well, as, certain, medical, conditions, only, affect, women, the, committee, on, the, elimination, of, discrimination, against, women, stipulates, in, its, general, recommendation, no, 35, on, gender, based, violence, against, women, updating, general, recommendation, no, 19, that, states, should, examine, gender, neutral, laws, and, policies, to, ensure, that, they, do, not, create, or, perpetuate, existing, inequalities, and, repeal, or, modify, them, if, they, do, so, paragraph, 32, another, example, of, gender, neutral, policy, which, harms, women, is, that, where, medication, tested, in, medical, trials, only, on, men, is, also, used, on, women, assuming, that, there, are, no, biological, differences, health, is, defined, by, the, world, health, organization, as, a, state, of, complete, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, and, not, merely, the, absence, of, disease, or, infirmity, women, s, health, refers, to, the, health, of, women, which, differs, from, that, of, men, in, many, unique, ways, women, s, health, is, severely, impaired, in, some, parts, of, the, world, due, to, factors, such, as, inequality, confinement, of, women, to, the, home, indifference, of, medical, workers, lack, of, autonomy, of, women, and, lack, of, financial, resources, of, women, discrimination, against, women, occurs, also, through, denial, of, medical, services, that, are, only, needed, by, women, violations, of, women, s, right, to, health, may, result, in, maternal, death, accounting, for, more, than, 300, 000, deaths, per, year, most, of, them, in, developing, countries, certain, traditional, practices, such, as, female, genital, mutilation, also, affect, women, s, health, worldwide, young, women, and, adolescent, girls, are, the, population, most, affected, by, hiv, aids, there, are, also, historical, cases, of, medical, abuse, of, women, notably, the, 19th, century, policy, of, wrongful, confinement, of, women, into, insane, asylums, often, at, the, request, of, husbands, and, male, relatives, a, notable, activist, against, such, practices, was, elizabeth, packard, who, was, wrongfully, committed, in, 1860, by, her, husband, and, filed, a, lawsuit, and, won, thereafter, highlighted, the, issue, of, wrongful, involuntary, commitment, another, activist, was, investigative, journalist, nellie, bly, who, went, undercover, in, 1887, at, an, asylum, in, new, york, city, to, expose, the, terrible, conditions, that, mental, patients, at, the, time, had, to, deal, with, the, right, to, education, is, a, universal, entitlement, to, education, the, convention, against, discrimination, in, education, prohibits, discrimination, in, education, with, discrimination, being, defined, as, any, distinction, exclusion, limitation, or, preference, which, being, based, on, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political, or, other, opinion, national, or, social, origin, economic, condition, or, birth, has, the, purpose, or, effect, of, nullifying, or, impairing, equality, of, treatment, in, education, the, international, covenant, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, states, at, article, 3, that, the, states, parties, to, the, present, covenant, undertake, to, ensure, the, equal, right, of, men, and, women, to, the, enjoyment, of, all, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, set, forth, in, the, present, covenant, with, article, 13, recognizing, the, right, of, everyone, to, education, access, to, education, for, women, remains, limited, in, some, parts, of, the, world, almost, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, illiterate, adults, are, women, while, women, s, right, to, access, to, academic, education, is, recognized, as, very, important, it, is, increasingly, recognized, that, academic, education, must, be, supplemented, with, education, on, human, rights, non, discrimination, ethics, and, gender, equality, in, order, for, social, advancement, to, be, possible, this, was, pointed, out, by, zeid, bin, ra, ad, the, current, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, human,

infections, reproductive, rights, are, often, defined, to, include, freedom, from, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, and, forced, abortion, and, forced, sterilization, the, istanbul, convention, recognizes, these, two, rights, at, article, 38, female, genital, mutilation, and, article, 39, forced, abortion, and, forced, sterilisation, reproductive, rights, are, understood, as, rights, of,

advanced, as, alternative, to, the, then, fashionable, terms, family, limitation, and, voluntary, motherhood, the, phrase, birth, control, entered, the, english, language, in, 1914, and, was,
