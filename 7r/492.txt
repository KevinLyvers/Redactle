a, constitution, is, the, aggregate, of, fundamental, principles, or, established, precedents, that, constitute, the, legal, basis, of, a, polity, organization, or, other, type, of, entity, and, commonly, determines, how, that, entity, is, to, be, governed, when, these, principles, are, written, down, into, a, single, document, or, set, of, legal, documents, those, documents, may, be, said, to, embody, a, written, constitution, if, they, are, encompassed, in, a, single, comprehensive, document, it, is, said, to, embody, a, codified, constitution, the, constitution, of, the, united, kingdom, is, a, notable, example, of, an, uncodified, constitution, it, is, instead, written, in, numerous, fundamental, acts, of, a, legislature, court, cases, and, treaties, constitutions, concern, different, levels, of, organizations, from, sovereign, countries, to, companies, and, unincorporated, associations, a, treaty, that, establishes, an, international, organization, is, also, its, constitution, in, that, it, would, define, how, that, organization, is, constituted, within, states, a, constitution, defines, the, principles, upon, which, the, state, is, based, the, procedure, in, which, laws, are, made, and, by, whom, some, constitutions, especially, codified, constitutions, also, act, as, limiters, of, state, power, by, establishing, lines, which, a, state, s, rulers, cannot, cross, such, as, fundamental, rights, changes, to, constitutions, frequently, require, consensus, or, supermajority, the, constitution, of, india, is, the, longest, written, constitution, of, any, country, in, the, world, with, 146, 385, words, in, its, english, language, version, while, the, constitution, of, monaco, is, the, shortest, written, constitution, with, 3, 814, words, the, constitution, of, san, marino, might, be, the, world, s, oldest, active, written, constitution, since, some, of, its, core, documents, have, been, in, operation, since, 1600, while, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, is, the, oldest, active, codified, constitution, the, historical, life, expectancy, of, a, constitution, since, 1789, is, approximately, 19, years, the, term, constitution, comes, through, french, from, the, latin, word, constitutio, used, for, regulations, and, orders, such, as, the, imperial, enactments, constitutiones, principis, edicta, mandata, decreta, rescripta, later, the, term, was, widely, used, in, canon, law, for, an, important, determination, especially, a, decree, issued, by, the, pope, now, referred, to, as, an, apostolic, constitution, william, blackstone, used, the, term, for, significant, and, egregious, violations, of, public, trust, of, a, nature, and, extent, that, the, transgression, would, justify, a, revolutionary, response, the, term, as, used, by, blackstone, was, not, for, a, legal, text, nor, did, he, intend, to, include, the, later, american, concept, of, judicial, review, for, that, were, to, set, the, judicial, power, above, that, of, the, legislature, which, would, be, subversive, of, all, government, generally, every, modern, written, constitution, confers, specific, powers, on, an, organization, or, institutional, entity, established, upon, the, primary, condition, that, it, abides, by, the, constitution, s, limitations, according, to, scott, gordon, a, political, organization, is, constitutional, to, the, extent, that, it, contain, institutionalized, mechanisms, of, power, control, for, the, protection, of, the, interests, and, liberties, of, the, citizenry, including, those, that, may, be, in, the, minority, activities, of, officials, within, an, organization, or, polity, that, fall, within, the, constitutional, or, statutory, authority, of, those, officials, are, termed, within, power, or, in, latin, intra, vires, if, they, do, not, they, are, termed, beyond, power, or, in, latin, ultra, vires, for, example, a, students, union, may, be, prohibited, as, an, organization, from, engaging, in, activities, not, concerning, students, if, the, union, becomes, involved, in, non, student, activities, these, activities, are, considered, to, be, ultra, vires, of, the, union, s, charter, and, nobody, would, be, compelled, by, the, charter, to, follow, them, an, example, from, the, constitutional, law, of, sovereign, states, would, be, a, provincial, parliament, in, a, federal, state, trying, to, legislate, in, an, area, that, the, constitution, allocates, exclusively, to, the, federal, parliament, such, as, ratifying, a, treaty, action, that, appears, to, be, beyond, power, may, be, judicially, reviewed, and, if, found, to, be, beyond, power, must, cease, legislation, that, is, found, to, be, beyond, power, will, be, invalid, and, of, no, force, this, applies, to, primary, legislation, requiring, constitutional, authorization, and, secondary, legislation, ordinarily, requiring, statutory, authorization, in, this, context, within, power, intra, vires, authorized, and, valid, have, the, same, meaning, as, do, beyond, power, ultra, vires, not, authorized, and, invalid, in, most, but, not, all, modern, states, the, constitution, has, supremacy, over, ordinary, statutory, law, see, uncodified, constitution, below, in, such, states, when, an, official, act, is, unconstitutional, i, e, it, is, not, a, power, granted, to, the, government, by, the, constitution, that, act, is, null, and, void, and, the, nullification, is, ab, initio, that, is, from, inception, not, from, the, date, of, the, finding, it, was, never, law, even, though, if, it, had, been, a, statute, or, statutory, provision, it, might, have, been, adopted, according, to, the, procedures, for, adopting, legislation, sometimes, the, problem, is, not, that, a, statute, is, unconstitutional, but, that, the, application, of, it, is, on, a, particular, occasion, and, a, court, may, decide, that, while, there, are, ways, it, could, be, applied, that, are, constitutional, that, instance, was, not, allowed, or, legitimate, in, such, a, case, only, that, application, may, be, ruled, unconstitutional, historically, the, remedies, for, such, violations, have, been, petitions, for, common, law, writs, such, as, quo, warranto, scholars, debate, whether, a, constitution, must, necessarily, be, autochthonous, resulting, from, the, nations, spirit, hegel, said, a, constitution, is, the, work, of, centuries, it, is, the, idea, the, consciousness, of, rationality, so, far, as, that, consciousness, is, developed, in, a, particular, nation, since, 1789, along, with, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, of, america, u, s, constitution, which, is, the, oldest, and, shortest, written, constitution, still, in, force, close, to, 800, constitutions, have, been, adopted, and, subsequently, amended, around, the, world, by, independent, states, in, the, late, 18th, century, thomas, jefferson, predicted, that, a, period, of, 20, years, would, be, the, optimal, time, for, any, constitution, to, be, still, in, force, since, the, earth, belongs, to, the, living, and, not, to, the, dead, indeed, according, to, recent, studies, the, average, life, of, any, new, written, constitution, is, around, 19, years, however, a, great, number, of, constitutions, do, not, last, more, than, 10, years, and, around, 10, do, not, last, more, than, one, year, as, was, the, case, of, the, french, constitution, of, 1791, by, contrast, some, constitutions, notably, that, of, the, united, states, have, remained, in, force, for, several, centuries, often, without, major, revision, for, long, periods, of, time, the, most, common, reasons, for, these, frequent, changes, are, the, political, desire, for, an, immediate, outcome, and, the, short, time, devoted, to, the, constitutional, drafting, process, a, study, in, 2009, showed, that, the, average, time, taken, to, draft, a, constitution, is, around, 16, months, however, there, were, also, some, extreme, cases, registered, for, example, the, myanmar, 2008, constitution, was, being, secretly, drafted, for, more, than, 17, years, whereas, at, the, other, extreme, during, the, drafting, of, japan, s, 1946, constitution, the, bureaucrats, drafted, everything, in, no, more, than, a, week, japan, has, the, oldest, unamended, constitution, in, the, world, the, record, for, the, shortest, overall, process, of, drafting, adoption, and, ratification, of, a, national, constitution, belongs, to, the, romania, s, 1938, constitution, which, installed, a, royal, dictatorship, in, less, than, a, month, studies, showed, that, typically, extreme, cases, where, the, constitution, making, process, either, takes, too, long, or, is, extremely, short, were, non, democracies, in, principle, constitutional, rights, are, not, a, specific, characteristic, of, democratic, countries, autocratic, states, have, constitutions, such, as, that, of, north, korea, which, officially, grants, every, citizen, among, other, things, the, freedom, of, expression, however, the, extent, to, which, governments, abide, by, their, own, constitutional, provisions, varies, in, north, korea, for, example, the, ten, principles, for, the, establishment, of, a, monolithic, ideological, system, are, said, to, have, eclipsed, the, constitution, in, importance, as, a, frame, of, government, in, practice, developing, a, legal, and, political, tradition, of, strict, adherence, to, constitutional, provisions, is, considered, foundational, to, the, rule, of, law, excavations, in, modern, day, iraq, by, ernest, de, sarzec, in, 1877, found, evidence, of, the, earliest, known, code, of, justice, issued, by, the, sumerian, king, urukagina, of, lagash, c, 2300, bc, perhaps, the, earliest, prototype, for, a, law, of, government, this, document, itself, has, not, yet, been, discovered, however, it, is, known, that, it, allowed, some, rights, to, his, citizens, for, example, it, is, known, that, it, relieved, tax, for, widows, and, orphans, and, protected, the, poor, from, the, usury, of, the, rich, after, that, many, governments, ruled, by, special, codes, of, written, laws, the, oldest, such, document, still, known, to, exist, seems, to, be, the, code, of, ur, nammu, of, ur, c, 2050, bc, some, of, the, better, known, ancient, law, codes, are, the, code, of, lipit, ishtar, of, isin, the, code, of, hammurabi, of, babylonia, the, hittite, code, the, assyrian, code, and, mosaic, law, in, 621, bc, a, scribe, named, draco, codified, the, oral, laws, of, the, city, state, of, athens, this, code, prescribed, the, death, penalty, for, many, offenses, thus, creating, the, modern, term, draconian, for, very, strict, rules, in, 594, bc, solon, the, ruler, of, athens, created, the, new, solonian, constitution, it, eased, the, burden, of, the, workers, and, determined, that, membership, of, the, ruling, class, was, to, be, based, on, wealth, plutocracy, rather, than, on, birth, aristocracy, cleisthenes, again, reformed, the, athenian, constitution, and, set, it, on, a, democratic, footing, in, 508, bc, aristotle, c, 350, bc, was, the, first, to, make, a, formal, distinction, between, ordinary, law, and, constitutional, law, establishing, ideas, of, constitution, and, constitutionalism, and, attempting, to, classify, different, forms, of, constitutional, government, the, most, basic, definition, he, used, to, describe, a, constitution, in, general, terms, was, the, arrangement, of, the, offices, in, a, state, in, his, works, constitution, of, athens, politics, and, nicomachean, ethics, he, explores, different, constitutions, of, his, day, including, those, of, athens, sparta, and, carthage, he, classified, both, what, he, regarded, as, good, and, what, he, regarded, as, bad, constitutions, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, best, constitution, was, a, mixed, system, including, monarchic, aristocratic, and, democratic, elements, he, also, distinguished, between, citizens, who, had, the, right, to, participate, in, the, state, and, non, citizens, and, slaves, who, did, not, the, romans, initially, codified, their, constitution, in, 450, bc, as, the, twelve, tables, they, operated, under, a, series, of, laws, that, were, added, from, time, to, time, but, roman, law, was, not, reorganized, into, a, single, code, until, the, codex, theodosianus, 438, ad, later, in, the, eastern, empire, the, codex, repetit, pr, lectionis, 534, was, highly, influential, throughout, europe, this, was, followed, in, the, east, by, the, ecloga, of, leo, iii, the, isaurian, 740, and, the, basilica, of, basil, i, 878, the, edicts, of, ashoka, established, constitutional, principles, for, the, 3rd, century, bc, maurya, king, s, rule, in, india, for, constitutional, principles, almost, lost, to, antiquity, see, the, code, of, manu, many, of, the, germanic, peoples, that, filled, the, power, vacuum, left, by, the, western, roman, empire, in, the, early, middle, ages, codified, their, laws, one, of, the, first, of, these, germanic, law, codes, to, be, written, was, the, visigothic, code, of, euric, 471, ad, this, was, followed, by, the, lex, burgundionum, applying, separate, codes, for, germans, and, for, romans, the, pactus, alamannorum, and, the, salic, law, of, the, franks, all, written, soon, after, 500, in, 506, the, breviarum, or, lex, romana, of, alaric, ii, king, of, the, visigoths, adopted, and, consolidated, the, codex, theodosianus, together, with, assorted, earlier, roman, laws, systems, that, appeared, somewhat, later, include, the, edictum, rothari, of, the, lombards, 643, the, lex, visigothorum, 654, the, lex, alamannorum, 730, and, the, lex, frisionum, c, 785, these, continental, codes, were, all, composed, in, latin, while, anglo, saxon, was, used, for, those, of, england, beginning, with, the, code, of, thelberht, of, kent, 602, around, 893, alfred, the, great, combined, this, and, two, other, earlier, saxon, codes, with, various, mosaic, and, christian, precepts, to, produce, the, doom, book, code, of, laws, for, england, japan, s, seventeen, article, constitution, written, in, 604, reportedly, by, prince, sh, toku, is, an, early, example, of, a, constitution, in, asian, political, history, influenced, by, buddhist, teachings, the, document, focuses, more, on, social, morality, than, on, institutions, of, government, and, remains, a, notable, early, attempt, at, a, government, constitution, the, constitution, of, medina, arabic, a, fat, al, mad, na, also, known, as, the, charter, of, medina, was, drafted, by, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, after, his, flight, hijra, to, yathrib, where, he, became, political, leader, it, constituted, a, formal, agreement, between, muhammad, and, all, of, the, significant, tribes, and, families, of, yathrib, later, known, as, medina, including, muslims, jews, and, pagans, the, document, was, drawn, up, with, the, explicit, concern, of, bringing, to, an, end, the, bitter, intertribal, fighting, between, the, clans, of, the, aws, aus, and, khazraj, within, medina, to, this, effect, it, instituted, a, number, of, rights, and, responsibilities, for, the, muslim, jewish, and, pagan, communities, of, medina, bringing, them, within, the, fold, of, one, community, the, ummah, the, precise, dating, of, the, constitution, of, medina, remains, debated, but, generally, scholars, agree, it, was, written, shortly, after, the, hijra, 622, in, wales, the, cyfraith, hywel, law, of, hywel, was, codified, by, hywel, dda, c, 942, 950, it, served, as, the, main, law, code, in, wales, until, it, was, superseded, by, the, laws, in, wales, acts, 1535, and, 1542, the, pravda, yaroslava, originally, combined, by, yaroslav, the, wise, the, grand, prince, of, kiev, was, granted, to, great, novgorod, around, 1017, and, in, 1054, was, incorporated, into, the, russkaya, pravda, it, became, the, law, for, all, of, kievan, rus, it, survived, only, in, later, editions, of, the, 15th, century, in, england, henry, i, s, proclamation, of, the, charter, of, liberties, in, 1100, bound, the, king, for, the, first, time, in, his, treatment, of, the, clergy, and, the, nobility, this, idea, was, extended, and, refined, by, the, english, barony, when, they, forced, king, john, to, sign, magna, carta, in, 1215, the, most, important, single, article, of, magna, carta, related, to, habeas, corpus, provided, that, the, king, was, not, permitted, to, imprison, outlaw, exile, or, kill, anyone, at, a, whim, there, must, be, due, process, of, law, first, this, article, article, 39, of, magna, carta, read, no, free, man, shall, be, arrested, or, imprisoned, or, deprived, of, his, property, or, outlawed, or, exiled, or, in, any, way, destroyed, nor, shall, we, go, against, him, or, send, against, him, unless, by, legal, judgement, of, his, peers, or, by, the, law, of, the, land, this, provision, became, the, cornerstone, of, english, liberty, after, that, point, the, social, contract, in, the, original, case, was, between, the, king, and, the, nobility, but, was, gradually, extended, to, all, of, the, people, it, led, to, the, system, of, constitutional, monarchy, with, further, reforms, shifting, the, balance, of, power, from, the, monarchy, and, nobility, to, the, house, of, commons, the, nomocanon, of, saint,

in, 1208, while, he, was, at, mount, athos, using, the, nomocanon, in, fourteen, titles, synopsis, of, stefan, the, efesian, nomocanon, of, john, scholasticus, and, ecumenical, council, documents,

even, two, centuries, before, if, usatges, of, barcelona, is, considered, part, of, the, compilation, of, constitutions, until, 1716, when, philip, v, of, spain, gave, the, nueva, planta, decrees, finishing, with, the, historical, laws, of, catalonia, these, constitutions, were, usually, made, formally, as, a, royal, initiative, but, required, for, its, approval, or, repeal, the, favorable, vote, of, the, catalan, courts, the, medieval, antecedent, of, the, modern, parliaments, these, laws, like, other, modern, constitutions, had, preeminence, over, other, laws, and, they, could, not,

system, of, governance, as, far, back, as, 1190, ad, though, perhaps, more, recently, at, 1451, in, which, the, sachems, or, tribal, chiefs, of, the, iroquois, league, s, member, nations, made, decisions, on, the, basis, of, universal, consensus, of, all, chiefs, following, discussions, that, were, initiated, by, a, single, nation, the, position, of, sachem, descends, through, families, and, are, allocated, by, the, senior, female, clan, heads, though, prior, to, the, filling, of, the, position, candidacy, is, ultimately, democratically, decided, by, the, community, itself, in, 1634, the, kingdom, of, sweden, adopted, the, 1634, instrument, of, government, drawn, up, under, the, lord, high, chancellor, of, sweden, axel, oxenstierna, after, the, death, of, king, gustavus, adolphus, this, can, be, seen, as, the, first, written, constitution, adopted, by, a, modern, state, in, 1639, the, colony, of, connecticut, adopted, the, fundamental, orders, which, was, the, first, north, american, constitution, it, is, the, basis, for, every, new, connecticut, constitution, since, and, is, also, the, reason, for, connecticut, s, nickname, the, constitution, state, on, 4, january,

legal, rationale, for, the, increasing, power, of, cromwell, after, parliament, consistently, failed, to, govern, effectively, most, of, the, concepts, and, ideas, embedded, into, modern, constitutional, theory, especially, bicameralism, separation, of, powers, the, written, constitution, and, judicial, review, can, be, traced, back, to, the, experiments, of, that, period, drafted, by, major, general, john, lambert, in, 1653, the, instrument, of, government, included, elements, incorporated, from, an, earlier, document, heads, of, proposals, which, had, been, agreed, to, by, the, army, council, in, 1647, as, a, set, of, propositions, intended, to, be, a, basis, for, a, constitutional, settlement, after, king, charles, i, was, defeated, in, the, first, english, civil, war, charles, had, rejected, the, propositions, but, before, the, start, of, the, second, civil, war, the, grandees, of, the, new, model, army, had, presented, the, heads, of, proposals, as, their, alternative, to, the, more, radical, agreement, of, the, people, presented, by, the, agitators, and, their, civilian, supporters, at, the, putney, debates, the, instrument, of, government, was, adopted, by, parliament, on, 15, december, 1653, and, oliver, cromwell, was, installed, as, lord, protector, on, the, following, day, the, constitution, set, up, a, state, council, consisting, of, 21, members, while, executive, authority, was, vested, in, the, office, of, lord, protector, of, the, commonwealth, this, position, was, designated, as, a, non, hereditary, life, appointment, the, instrument, also, required, the, calling, of, triennial, parliaments, with, each, sitting, for, at, least, five, months, the, instrument, of, government, was, replaced, in, may, 1657, by, england, s, second, and, last, codified, constitution, the, humble, petition, and, advice, proposed, by, sir, christopher, packe, the, petition, offered, hereditary, monarchy, to, oliver, cromwell, asserted, parliament, s, control, over, issuing, new, taxation, provided, an, independent, council, to, advise, the, king, and, safeguarded, triennial, meetings, of, parliament, a, modified, version, of, the, humble, petition, with, the, clause, on, kingship, removed, was, ratified, on, 25, may, this, finally, met, its, demise, in, conjunction, with, the, death, of, cromwell, and, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, all, of, the, british, colonies, in, north, america, that, were, to, become, the, 13, original, united, states, adopted, their, own, constitutions, in, 1776, and, 1777, during, the, american, revolution, and, before, the, later, articles, of, confederation, and, united, states, constitution, with, the, exceptions, of, massachusetts, connecticut, and, rhode, island, the, commonwealth, of, massachusetts, adopted, its, constitution, in, 1780, the, oldest, still, functioning, constitution, of, any, u, s, state, while, connecticut, and, rhode, island, officially, continued, to, operate, under, their, old, colonial, charters, until, they, adopted, their, first, state, constitutions, in, 1818, and, 1843, respectively, what, is, sometimes, called, the, enlightened, constitution, model, was, developed, by, philosophers, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, such, as, thomas, hobbes, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, john, locke, the, model, proposed, that, constitutional, governments, should, be, stable, adaptable, accountable, open, and, should, represent, the, people, i, e, support, democracy, agreements, and, constitutions, of, laws, and, freedoms, of, the, zaporizian, host, was, written, in, 1710, by, pylyp, orlyk, hetman, of, the, zaporozhian, host, it, was, written, to, establish, a, free, zaporozhian, ukrainian, republic, with, the, support, of, charles, xii, of, sweden, it, is, notable, in, that, it, established, a, democratic, standard, for, the, separation, of, powers, in, government, between, the, legislative, executive, and, judiciary, branches, well, before, the, publication, of, montesquieu, s, spirit, of, the, laws, this, constitution, also, limited, the, executive, authority, of, the, hetman, and, established, a, democratically, elected, cossack, parliament, called, the, general, council, however, orlyk, s, project, for, an, independent, ukrainian, state, never, materialized, and, his, constitution, written, in, exile, never, went, into, effect, corsican, constitutions, of, 1755, and, 1794, were, inspired, by, jean, jacques, rousseau, the, latter, introduced, universal, suffrage, for, property, owners, the, swedish, constitution, of, 1772, was, enacted, under, king, gustavus, iii, and, was, inspired, by, the, separation, of, powers, by, montesquieu, the, king, also, cherished, other, enlightenment, ideas, as, an, enlighted, despot, and, repealed, torture, liberated, agricultural, trade, diminished, the, use, of, the, death, penalty, and, instituted, a, form, of, religious, freedom, the, constitution, was, commended, by, voltaire, the, united, states, constitution, ratified, 21, june, 1788, was, influenced, by, the, writings, of, polybius, locke, montesquieu, and, others, the, document, became, a, benchmark, for, republicanism, and, codified, constitutions, written, thereafter, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, constitution, was, passed, on, 3, may, 1791, its, draft, was, developed, by, the, leading, minds, of, the, enlightenment, in, poland, such, as, king, stanislaw, august, poniatowski, stanis, aw, staszic, scipione, piattoli, julian, ursyn, niemcewicz, ignacy, potocki, and, hugo, ko, taj, it, was, adopted, by, the, great, sejm, and, is, considered, the, first, constitution, of, its, kind, in, europe, and, the, world, s, second, oldest, one, after, the, american, constitution, another, landmark, document, was, the, french, constitution, of, 1791, the, 1811, constitution, of, venezuela, was, the, first, constitution, of, venezuela, and, latin, america, promulgated, and, drafted, by, crist, bal, mendoza, and, juan, germ, n, roscio, and, in, caracas, it, established, a, federal, government, but, was, repealed, one, year, later, on, 19, march, 1812, the, spanish, constitution, of, 1812, was, ratified, by, a, parliament, gathered, in, cadiz, the, only, spanish, continental, city, which, was, safe, from, french, occupation, the, spanish, constitution, served, as, a, model, for, other, liberal, constitutions, of, several, south, european, and, latin, american, nations, for, example, the, portuguese, constitution, of, 1822, constitutions, of, various, italian, states, during, carbonari, revolts, i, e, in, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, the, norwegian, constitution, of, 1814, or, the, mexican, constitution, of, 1824, in, brazil, the, constitution, of, 1824, expressed, the, option, for, the, monarchy, as, political, system, after, brazilian, independence, the, leader, of, the, national, emancipation, process, was, the, portuguese, prince, pedro, i, elder, son, of, the, king, of, portugal, pedro, was, crowned, in, 1822, as, first, emperor, of, brazil, the, country, was, ruled, by, constitutional, monarchy, until, 1889, when, it, adopted, the, republican, model, in, denmark, as, a, result, of, the, napoleonic, wars, the, absolute, monarchy, lost, its, personal, possession, of, norway, to, sweden, sweden, had, already, enacted, its, 1809, instrument, of, government, which, saw, the, division, of, power, between, the, riksdag, the, king, and, the, judiciary, however, the, norwegians, managed, to, infuse, a, radically, democratic, and, liberal, constitution, in, 1814, adopting, many, facets, from, the, american, constitution, and, the, revolutionary, french, ones, but, maintaining, a, hereditary, monarch, limited, by, the, constitution, like, the, spanish, one, the, first, swiss, federal, constitution, was, put, in, force, in, september, 1848, with, official, revisions, in, 1878, 1891, 1949, 1971, 1982, and, 1999, the, serbian, revolution, initially, led, to, a, proclamation, of, a, proto, constitution, in, 1811, the, full, fledged, constitution, of, serbia, followed, few, decades, later, in, 1835, the, first, serbian, constitution, sretenjski, ustav, was, adopted, at, the, national, assembly, in, kragujevac, on, 15, february, 1835, the, constitution, of, canada, came, into, force, on, 1, july, 1867, as, the, british, north, america, act, an, act, of, the, british, parliament, over, a, century, later, the, bna, act, was, patriated, to, the, canadian, parliament, and, augmented, with, the, canadian, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, apart, from, the, constitution, acts, 1867, to, 1982, canada, s, constitution, also, has, unwritten, elements, based, in, common, law, and, convention, after, tribal, people, first, began, to, live, in, cities, and, establish, nations, many, of, these, functioned, according, to, unwritten, customs, while, some, developed, autocratic, even, tyrannical, monarchs, who, ruled, by, decree, or, mere, personal, whim, such, rule, led, some, thinkers, to, take, the, position, that, what, mattered, was, not, the, design, of, governmental, institutions, and, operations, as, much, as, the, character, of, the, rulers, this, view, can, be, seen, in, plato, who, called, for, rule, by, philosopher, kings, later, writers, such, as, aristotle, cicero, and, plutarch, would, examine, designs, for, government, from, a, legal, and, historical, standpoint, the, renaissance, brought, a, series, of, political, philosophers, who, wrote, implied, criticisms, of, the, practices, of, monarchs, and, sought, to, identify, principles, of, constitutional, design, that, would, be, likely, to, yield, more, effective, and, just, governance, from, their, viewpoints, this, began, with, revival, of, the, roman, law, of, nations, concept, and, its, application, to, the, relations, among, nations, and, they, sought, to, establish, customary, laws, of, war, and, peace, to, ameliorate, wars, and, make, them, less, likely, this, led, to, considerations, of, what, authority, monarchs, or, other, officials, have, and, don, t, have, from, where, that, authority, derives, and, the, remedies, for, the, abuse, of, such, authority, a, seminal, juncture, in, this, line, of, discourse, arose, in, england, from, the, civil, war, the, cromwellian, protectorate, the, writings, of, thomas, hobbes, samuel, rutherford, the, levellers, john, milton, and, james, harrington, leading, to, the, debate, between, robert, filmer, arguing, for, the, divine, right, of, monarchs, on, the, one, side, and, on, the, other, henry, neville, james, tyrrell, algernon, sidney, and, john, locke, what, arose, from, the, latter, was, a, concept, of, government, being, erected, on, the, foundations, of, first, a, state, of, nature, governed, by, natural, laws, then, a, state, of, society, established, by, a, social, contract, or, compact, which, bring, underlying, natural, or, social, laws, before, governments, are, formally, established, on, them, as, foundations, along, the, way, several, writers, examined, how, the, design, of, government, was, important, even, if, the, government, were, headed, by, a, monarch, they, also, classified, various, historical, examples, of, governmental, designs, typically, into, democracies, aristocracies, or, monarchies, and, considered, how, just, and, effective, each, tended, to, be, and, why, and, how, the, advantages, of, each, might, be, obtained, by, combining, elements, of, each, into, a, more, complex, design, that, balanced, competing, tendencies, some, such, as, montesquieu, also, examined, how, the, functions, of, government, such, as, legislative, executive, and, judicial, might, appropriately, be, separated, into, branches, the, prevailing, theme, among, these, writers, was, that, the, design, of, constitutions, is, not, completely, arbitrary, or, a, matter, of, taste, they, generally, held, that, there, are, underlying, principles, of, design, that, constrain, all, constitutions, for, every, polity, or, organization, each, built, on, the, ideas, of, those, before, concerning, what, those, principles, might, be, the, later, writings, of, orestes, brownson, would, try, to, explain, what, constitutional, designers, were, trying, to, do, according, to, brownson, there, are, in, a, sense, three, constitutions, involved, the, first, the, constitution, of, nature, that, includes, all, of, what, was, called, natural, law, the, second, is, the, constitution, of, society, an, unwritten, and, commonly, understood, set, of, rules, for, the, society, formed, by, a, social, contract, before, it, establishes, a, government, by, which, it, establishes, the, third, a, constitution, of, government, the, second, would, include, such, elements, as, the, making, of, decisions, by, public, conventions, called, by, public, notice, and, conducted, by, established, rules, of, procedure, each, constitution, must, be, consistent, with, and, derive, its, authority, from, the, ones, before, it, as, well, as, from, a, historical, act, of, society, formation, or, constitutional, ratification, brownson, argued, that, a, state, is, a, society, with, effective, dominion, over, a, well, defined, territory, that, consent, to, a, well, designed, constitution, of, government, arises, from, presence, on, that, territory, and, that, it, is, possible, for, provisions, of, a, written, constitution, of, government, to, be, unconstitutional, if, they, are, inconsistent, with, the, constitutions, of, nature, or, society, brownson, argued, that, it, is, not, ratification, alone, that, makes, a, written, constitution, of, government, legitimate, but, that, it, must, also, be, competently, designed, and, applied, other, writers, have, argued, that, such, considerations, apply, not, only, to, all, national, constitutions, of, government, but, also, to, the, constitutions, of, private, organizations, that, it, is, not, an, accident, that, the, constitutions, that, tend, to, satisfy, their, members, contain, certain, elements, as, a, minimum, or, that, their, provisions, tend, to, become, very, similar, as, they, are, amended, after, experience, with, their, use, provisions, that, give, rise, to, certain, kinds, of, questions, are, seen, to, need, additional, provisions, for, how, to, resolve, those, questions, and, provisions, that, offer, no, course, of, action, may, best, be, omitted, and, left, to, policy, decisions, provisions, that, conflict, with, what, brownson, and, others, can, discern, are, the, underlying, constitutions, of, nature, and, society, tend, to, be, difficult, or, impossible, to, execute, or, to, lead, to, unresolvable, disputes, constitutional, design, has, been, treated, as, a, kind, of, metagame, in, which, play, consists, of, finding, the, best, design, and, provisions, for, a, written, constitution, that, will, be, the, rules, for, the, game, of, government, and, that, will, be, most, likely, to, optimize, a, balance, of, the, utilities, of, justice, liberty, and, security, an, example, is, the, metagame, nomic, political, economy, theory, regards, constitutions, as, coordination, devices, that, help, citizens, to, prevent, rulers, from, abusing, power, if, the, citizenry, can, coordinate, a, response, to, police, government, officials, in, the, face, of, a, constitutional, fault, then, the, government, have, the, incentives, to, honor, the, rights, that, the, constitution, guarantees, an, alternative, view, considers, that, constitutions, are, not, enforced, by, the, citizens, at, large, but, rather, by, the, administrative, powers, of, the, state, because, rulers, cannot, themselves, implement, their, policies, they, need, to, rely, on, a, set, of, organizations, armies, courts, police, agencies, tax, collectors, to, implement, it, in, this, position, they, can, directly, sanction, the, government, by, refusing, to, cooperate, disabling, the, authority, of, the, rulers, therefore, constitutions, could, be, characterized, by, a, self, enforcing, equilibria, between, the, rulers, and, powerful, administrators, most, commonly, the, term, constitution, refers, to, a, set, of, rules, and, principles, that, define, the, nature, and, extent, of, government, most, constitutions, seek, to, regulate, the, relationship, between, institutions, of, the, state, in, a, basic, sense, the, relationship, between, the, executive, legislature, and, the, judiciary, but, also, the, relationship, of, institutions, within, those, branches, for, example, executive, branches, can, be, divided, into, a, head, of, government, government, departments, ministries, executive, agencies, and, a, civil, service, administration, most, constitutions, also, attempt, to, define, the, relationship, between, individuals, and, the, state, and, to, establish, the, broad, rights, of, individual, citizens, it, is, thus, the, most, basic, law, of, a, territory, from, which, all, the, other, laws, and, rules, are, hierarchically, derived, in, some, territories, it, is, in, fact, called, basic, law, a, fundamental, classification, is, codification, or, lack, of, codification, a, codified, constitution, is, one, that, is, contained, in, a, single, document, which, is, the, single, source, of, constitutional, law, in, a, state, an, uncodified, constitution, is, one, that, is, not, contained, in, a, single, document, consisting, of, several, different, sources, which, may, be, written, or, unwritten, see, constitutional, convention, most, states, in, the, world, have, codified, constitutions, codified, constitutions, are, often, the, product, of, some, dramatic, political, change, such, as, a, revolution, the, process, by, which, a, country, adopts, a, constitution, is, closely, tied, to, the, historical, and, political, context, driving, this, fundamental, change, the, legitimacy, and, often, the, longevity, of, codified, constitutions, has, often, been, tied, to, the, process, by, which, they, are, initially, adopted, and, some, scholars, have, pointed, out, that, high, constitutional, turnover, within, a, given, country, may, itself, be, detrimental, to, separation, of, powers, and, the, rule, of, law, states, that, have, codified, constitutions, normally, give, the, constitution, supremacy, over, ordinary, statute, law, that, is, if, there, is, any, conflict, between, a, legal, statute, and, the, codified, constitution, all, or, part, of, the, statute, can, be, declared, ultra, vires, by, a, court, and, struck, down, as, unconstitutional, in, addition, exceptional, procedures, are, often, required, to, amend, a, constitution, these, procedures, may, include, convocation, of, a, special, constituent, assembly, or, constitutional, convention, requiring, a, supermajority, of, legislators, votes, approval, in, two, terms, of, parliament, the, consent, of, regional, legislatures, a, referendum, process, and, or, other, procedures, that, make, amending, a, constitution, more, difficult, than, passing, a, simple, law, constitutions, may, also, provide, that, their, most, basic, principles, can, never, be, abolished, even, by, amendment, in, case, a, formally, valid, amendment, of, a, constitution, infringes, these, principles, protected, against, any, amendment, it, may, constitute, a, so, called, unconstitutional, constitutional, law, codified, constitutions, normally, consist, of, a, ceremonial, preamble, which, sets, forth, the, goals, of, the, state, and, the, motivation, for, the, constitution, and, several, articles, containing, the, substantive, provisions, the, preamble, which, is, omitted, in, some, constitutions, may, contain, a, reference, to, god, and, or, to, fundamental, values, of, the, state, such, as, liberty, democracy, or, human, rights, in, ethnic, nation, states, such, as, estonia, the, mission, of, the, state, can, be, defined, as, preserving, a, specific, nation, language, and, culture, as, of, 2017, only, two, sovereign, states, new, zealand, and, the, united, kingdom, have, wholly, uncodified, constitutions, the, basic, laws, of, israel, have, since, 1950, been, intended, to, be, the, basis, for, a, constitution, but, as, of, 2017, it, had, not, been, drafted, the, various, laws, are, considered, to, have, precedence, over, other, laws, and, give, the, procedure, by, which, they, can, be, amended, typically, by, a, simple, majority, of, members, of, the, knesset, parliament, uncodified, constitutions, are, the, product, of, an, evolution, of, laws, and, conventions, over, centuries, such, as, in, the, westminster, system, that, developed, in, britain, by, contrast, to, codified, constitutions, uncodified, constitutions, include, both, written, sources, e, g, constitutional, statutes, enacted, by, the, parliament, and, unwritten, sources, constitutional, conventions, observation, of, precedents, royal, prerogatives, customs, and, traditions, such, as, holding, general, elections, on, thursdays, together, these, constitute, british, constitutional, law, some, constitutions, are, largely, but, not, wholly, codified, for, example, in, the, constitution, of, australia, most, of, its, fundamental, political, principles, and, regulations, concerning, the, relationship, between, branches, of, government, and, concerning, the, government, and, the, individual, are, codified, in, a, single, document, the, constitution, of, the, commonwealth, of, australia, however, the, presence, of, statutes, with, constitutional, significance, namely, the, statute, of, westminster, as, adopted, by, the, commonwealth, in, the, statute, of, westminster, adoption, act, 1942, and, the, australia, act, 1986, means, that, australia, s, constitution, is, not, contained, in, a, single, constitutional, document, it, means, the, constitution, of, australia, is, uncodified, it, also, contains, constitutional, conventions, thus, is, partially, unwritten, the, constitution, of, canada, resulted, from, the, passage, of, several, british, north, america, acts, from, 1867, to, the, canada, act, 1982, the, act, that, formally, severed, british, parliament, s, ability, to, amend, the, canadian, constitution, the, canadian, constitution, includes, specific, legislative, acts, as, mentioned, in, section, 52, 2, of, the, constitution, act, 1982, however, some, documents, not, explicitly, listed, in, section, 52, 2, are, also, considered, constitutional, documents, in, canada, entrenched, via, reference, such, as, the, proclamation, of, 1763, although, canada, s, constitution, includes, a, number, of, different, statutes, amendments, and, references, some, constitutional, rules, that, exist, in, canada, are, derived, from, unwritten, sources, and, constitutional, conventions, the, terms, written, constitution, and, codified, constitution, are, often, used, interchangeably, as, are, unwritten, constitution, and, uncodified, constitution, although, this, usage, is, technically, inaccurate, a, codified, constitution, is, a, single, document, states, that, do, not, have, such, a, document, have, uncodified, but, not, entirely, unwritten, constitutions, since, much, of, an, uncodified, constitution, is, usually, written, in, laws, such, as, the, basic, laws, of, israel, and, the, parliament, acts, of, the, united, kingdom, uncodified, constitutions, largely, lack, protection, against, amendment, by, the, government, of, the, time, for, example, the, u, k, fixed, term, parliaments, act, 2011, legislated, by, simple, majority, for, strictly, fixed, term, parliaments, until, then, the, ruling, party, could, call, a, general, election, at, any, convenient, time, up, to, the, maximum, term, of, five, years, this, change, would, require, a, constitutional, amendment, in, most, nations, a, constitutional, amendment, is, a, modification, of, the, constitution, of, a, polity, organization, or, other, type, of, entity, amendments, are, often, interwoven, into, the, relevant, sections, of, an, existing, constitution, directly, altering, the, text, conversely, they, can, be, appended, to, the, constitution, as, supplemental, additions, codicils, thus, changing, the, frame, of, government, without, altering, the, existing, text, of, the, document, most, constitutions, require, that, amendments, cannot, be, enacted, unless, they, have, passed, a, special, procedure, that, is, more, stringent, than, that, required, of, ordinary, legislation, some, countries, are, listed, under, more, than, one, method, because, alternative, procedures, may, be, used, an, entrenched, clause, or, entrenchment, clause, of, a, basic, law, or, constitution, is, a, provision, that, makes, certain, amendments, either, more, difficult, or, impossible, to, pass, making, such, amendments, inadmissible, overriding, an, entrenched, clause, may, require, a, supermajority, a, referendum, or, the, consent, of, the, minority, party, for, example, the, u, s, constitution, has, an, entrenched, clause, that, prohibits, abolishing, equal, suffrage, of, the, states, within, the, senate, without, their, consent, the, term, eternity, clause, is, used, in, a, similar, manner, in, the, constitutions, of, the, czech, republic, germany, turkey, greece, italy, morocco, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, brazil, and, norway, india, s, constitution, does, not, contain, specific, provisions, on, entrenched, clauses, but, the, basic, structure, doctrine, makes, it, impossible, for, certain, basic, features, of, the, constitution, to, be, altered, or, destroyed, by, the, parliament, of, india, through, an, amendment, the, constitution, of, colombia, also, lacks, explicit, entrenched, clauses, but, has, a, similar, substantive, limit, on, amending, its, fundamental, principles, through, judicial, interpretations, constitutions, include, various, rights, and, duties, these, include, the, following, constitutions, usually, explicitly, divide, power, between, various, branches, of, government, the, standard, model, described, by, the, baron, de, montesquieu, involves, three, branches, of, government, executive, legislative, and, judicial, some, constitutions, include, additional, branches, such, as, an, auditory, branch, constitutions, vary, extensively, as, to, the, degree, of, separation, of, powers, between, these, branches, in, presidential, and, semi, presidential, systems, of, government, department, secretaries, ministers, are, accountable, to, the, president, who, has, patronage, powers, to, appoint, and, dismiss, ministers, the, president, is, accountable, to, the, people, in, an, election, in, parliamentary, systems, cabinet, ministers, are, accountable, to, parliament, but, it, is, the, prime, minister, who, appoints, and, dismisses, them, in, the, case, of, the, united, kingdom, and, other, countries, with, a, monarchy, it, is, the, monarch, who, appoints, and, dismisses, ministers, on, the, advice, of, the, prime, minister, in, turn, the, prime, minister, will, resign, if, the, government, loses, the, confidence, of, the, parliament, or, a, part, of, it, confidence, can, be, lost, if, the, government, loses, a, vote, of, no, confidence, or, depending, on, the, country, loses, a, particularly, important, vote, in, parliament, such, as, vote, on, the, budget, when, a, government, loses, confidence, it, stays, in, office, until, a, new, government, is, formed, something, which, normally, but, not, necessarily, required, the, holding, of, a, general, election, other, independent, institutions, which, some, constitutions, have, set, out, include, a, central, bank, an, anti, corruption, commission, an, electoral, commission, a, judicial, oversight, body, a, human, rights, commission, a, media, commission, an, ombudsman, and, a, truth, and, reconciliation, commission, constitutions, also, establish, where, sovereignty, is, located, in, the, state, there, are, three, basic, types, of, distribution, of, sovereignty, according, to, the, degree, of, centralisation, of, power, unitary, federal, and, confederal, the, distinction, is, not, absolute, in, a, unitary, state, sovereignty, resides, in, the, state, itself, and, the, constitution, determines, this, the, territory, of, the, state, may, be, divided, into, regions, but, they, are, not, sovereign, and, are, subordinate, to, the, state, in, the, uk, the, constitutional, doctrine, of, parliamentary, sovereignty, dictates, that, sovereignty, is, ultimately, contained, at, the, centre, some, powers, have, been, devolved, to, northern, ireland, scotland, and, wales, but, not, england, some, unitary, states, spain, is, an, example, devolve, more, and, more, power, to, sub, national, governments, until, the, state, functions, in, practice, much, like, a, federal, state, a, federal, state, has, a, central, structure, with, at, most, a, small, amount, of, territory, mainly, containing, the, institutions, of, the, federal, government, and, several, regions, called, states, provinces, etc, which, compose, the, territory, of, the, whole, state, sovereignty, is, divided, between, the, centre, and, the, constituent, regions, the, constitutions, of, canada, and, the, united, states, establish, federal, states, with, power, divided, between, the, federal, government, and, the, provinces, or, states, each, of, the, regions, may, in, turn, have, its, own, constitution, of, unitary, nature, a, confederal, state, comprises, again, several, regions, but, the, central, structure, has, only, limited, coordinating, power, and, sovereignty, is, located, in, the, regions, confederal, constitutions, are, rare, and, there, is, often, dispute, to, whether, so, called, confederal, states, are, actually, federal, to, some, extent, a, group, of, states, which, do, not, constitute, a, federation, as, such, may, by, treaties, and, accords, give, up, parts, of, their, sovereignty, to, a, supranational, entity, for, example, the, countries, constituting, the, european, union, have, agreed, to, abide, by, some, union, wide, measures, which, restrict, their, absolute, sovereignty, in, some, ways, e, g, the, use, of, the, metric, system, of, measurement, instead, of, national, units, previously, used, many, constitutions, allow, the, declaration, under, exceptional, circumstances, of, some, form, of, state, of, emergency, during, which, some, rights, and, guarantees, are, suspended, this, provision, can, be, and, has, been, abused, to, allow, a, government, to, suppress, dissent, without, regard, for, human, rights, see, the, article, on, state, of, emergency, italian, political, theorist, giovanni, sartori, noted, the, existence, of, national, constitutions, which, are, a, facade, for, authoritarian, sources, of, power, while, such, documents, may, express, respect, for, human, rights, or, establish, an, independent, judiciary, they, may, be, ignored, when, the, government, feels, threatened, or, never, put, into, practice, an, extreme, example, was, the, constitution, of, the, soviet, union, that, on, paper, supported, freedom, of, assembly, and, freedom, of, speech, however, citizens, who, transgressed, unwritten, limits, were, summarily, imprisoned, the, example, demonstrates, that, the, protections, and, benefits, of, a, constitution, are, ultimately, provided, not, through, its, written, terms, but, through, deference, by, government, and, society, to, its, principles, a, constitution, may, change, from, being, real, to, a, facade, and, back, again, as, democratic, and, autocratic, governments, succeed, each, other, constitutions, are, often, but, by, no, means, always, protected, by, a, legal, body, whose, job, it, is, to, interpret, those, constitutions, and, where, applicable, declare, void, executive, and, legislative, acts, which, infringe, the, constitution, in, some, countries, such, as, germany, this, function, is, carried, out, by, a, dedicated, constitutional, court, which, performs, this, and, only, this, function, in, other, countries, such, as, ireland, the, ordinary, courts, may, perform, this, function, in, addition, to, their, other, responsibilities, while, elsewhere, like, in, the, united, kingdom, the, concept, of, declaring, an, act, to, be, unconstitutional, does, not, exist, a, constitutional, violation, is, an, action, or, legislative, act, that, is, judged, by, a, constitutional, court, to, be, contrary, to, the, constitution, that, is, unconstitutional, an, example, of, constitutional, violation, by, the, executive, could, be, a, public, office, holder, who, acts, outside, the, powers, granted, to, that, office, by, a, constitution, an, example, of, constitutional, violation, by, the, legislature, is, an, attempt, to, pass, a, law, that, would, contradict, the, constitution, without, first, going, through, the, proper, constitutional, amendment, process, some, countries, mainly, those, with, uncodified, constitutions, have, no, such, courts, at, all, for, example, the, united, kingdom, has, traditionally, operated, under, the, principle, of, parliamentary, sovereignty, under, which, the, laws, passed, by, united, kingdom, parliament, could, not, be, questioned, by, the, courts, judicial, philosophies, of, constitutional, interpretation, note, generally, specific, to, united, states, constitutional, law
