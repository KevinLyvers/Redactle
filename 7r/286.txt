agreed, to, unanimously, the, penalty, was, motivated, because, the, foreign, ministers, checked, the, veracity, of, the, claim, that, the, rafael, trujillo, regime, had, sponsored, an, attack, against, r, mulo, betancourt, at, that, time, the, constitutional, president, of, venezuela, the, meeting, was, attended, by, foreign, ministers, from, 21, american, nations, including, cuba, which,

cuban, nation, was, still, technically, a, member, state, but, that, the, current, government, was, denied, the, right, of, representation, and, attendance, at, meetings, and, of, participation, in, activities, the, oas, s, position, was, that, although, cuba, s, participation, was, suspended, its, obligations, under, the, charter, the, american, declaration, of, the, rights, and, duties, of, man, etc, still, hold, for, instance, the, inter, american, commission, on, human, rights, continues, to, publish, reports, on, cuba, s, human, rights, situation, and, to, hear, individual, cases, involving, cuban, nationals, however, this, stance, was, occasionally, questioned, by, other, individual, member, states, the, resolution, to, exclude, cuba, was, controversial, when, it, was, adopted, and, the, reintegration, of, cuba, into, the, inter, american, system, has, remained, a, frequent, source, of, contention, among, the, countries, of, the, hemisphere, ever, since, cuba, s, position, was, stated, in, an, official, note, sent, to, the, organization, merely, as, a, courtesy, by, minister, of, foreign, affairs, ra, l, roa, on, 4, november, 1964, cuba, was, arbitrarily,

reincorporation, of, cuba, as, an, active, member, regularly, arose, as, a, topic, within, the, inter, american, system, for, instance, it, was, intimated, by, the, outgoing, ambassador, of, mexico, in, 1998, but, most, observers, did, not, see, it, as, a, serious, possibility, while, the, present, government, remained, in, power, since, 1960, the, cuban, administration, had, repeatedly, characterized, the, oas, as, the, ministry, of, colonies, of, the, united, states, of, america, fidel, castro, and, his, brother, ra, l, attacked, the, oas, as, a, yankee, bordello, and, instrument, of, imperialist, domination, and, vowed, that, cuba, would, never, join, although, oas, rescinded, the, nation, s, expulsion, in, 2009, and, invited, it, to, apply, for, readmission, venezuelan, president, hugo, ch, vez, promised, to, veto, any, final, declaration, of, the, 2009, summit, of, the, americas, due, to, cuba, s, exclusion, on, 17, april, 2009, after, a, trading, of, warm, words,

said, that, suspension, was, made, in, the, cold, war, in, the, language, of, the, cold, war, what, we, have, done, here, is, fix, a, historic, error, the, suspension, was, lifted, at, the, end, of, the, general, assembly, but, to, be, readmitted, to, the, organization, cuba, will, need, to, comply, with, all, the, treaties, signed, by, the, member, states, including, the, inter, american, democratic, charter, of, 2001, a, statement, issued, by, the, cuban, government, on, 8, june, 2009, stated, that, while, cuba, welcomed, the, assembly, s, gesture, in, light, of, the, organization, s,
