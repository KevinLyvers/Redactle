a, political, party, is, an, organization, that, coordinates, candidates, to, compete, in, a, particular, country, s, elections, it, is, common, for, the, members, of, a, party, to, hold, similar, ideas, about, politics, and, parties, may, promote, specific, ideological, or, policy, goals, political, parties, have, become, a, major, part, of, the, politics, of, almost, every, country, as, modern, party, organizations, developed, and, spread, around, the, world, over, the, last, few, centuries, although, some, countries, have, no, political, parties, this, is, extremely, rare, most, countries, have, several, parties, while, others, only, have, one, parties, are, important, in, the, politics, of, autocracies, as, well, as, democracies, though, usually, democracies, have, more, political, parties, than, autocracies, autocracies, often, have, a, single, party, that, governs, the, country, and, some, political, scientists, consider, competition, between, two, or, more, parties, to, be, an, essential, part, of, democracy, parties, can, develop, from, existing, divisions, in, society, like, the, divisions, between, lower, and, upper, classes, and, they, streamline, the, process, of, making, political, decisions, by, encouraging, their, members, to, cooperate, political, parties, usually, include, a, party, leader, who, has, primary, responsibility, for, the, activities, of, the, party, party, executives, who, may, select, the, leader, and, who, perform, administrative, and, organizational, tasks, and, party, members, who, may, volunteer, to, help, the, party, donate, money, to, it, and, vote, for, its, candidates, there, are, many, different, ways, in, which, political, parties, can, be, structured, and, interact, with, the, electorate, the, contributions, that, citizens, give, to, political, parties, are, often, regulated, by, law, and, parties, will, sometimes, govern, in, a, way, that, favours, the, people, who, donate, time, and, money, to, them, many, political, parties, are, motivated, by, ideological, goals, it, is, common, for, democratic, elections, to, feature, competitions, between, liberal, conservative, and, socialist, parties, other, common, ideologies, of, very, large, political, parties, include, communism, populism, nationalism, and, islamism, political, parties, in, different, countries, will, often, adopt, similar, colours, and, symbols, to, identify, themselves, with, a, particular, ideology, however, many, political, parties, have, no, ideological, affiliation, and, may, instead, be, primarily, engaged, in, patronage, clientelism, the, advancement, of, a, specific, political, entrepreneur, or, be, a, big, tent, in, that, they, wish, to, attract, voters, who, have, a, variety, of, positions, on, issues, political, parties, are, collective, entities, and, activities, that, organize, competitions, for, political, offices, 3, the, members, of, a, political, party, contest, elections, under, a, shared, label, in, a, narrow, definition, a, political, party, can, be, thought, of, as, just, the, group, of, candidates, who, run, for, office, under, a, party, label, 3, in, a, broader, definition, political, parties, are, the, entire, apparatus, that, supports, the, election, of, a, group, of, candidates, including, voters, and, volunteers, who, identify, with, a, particular, political, party, the, official, party, organizations, that, support, the, election, of, that, party, s, candidates, and, legislators, in, the, government, who, are, affiliated, with, the, party, in, many, countries, the, notion, of, a, political, party, is, defined, in, law, and, governments, may, specify, requirements, for, an, organization, to, legally, qualify, as, a, political, party, political, parties, are, distinguished, from, other, political, groups, or, clubs, such, as, parliamentary, groups, because, only, presidents, have, control, over, the, political, foundations, of, the, party, and, also, they, include, political, factions, or, advocacy, groups, mostly, by, the, fact, that, a, party, is, focused, on, electing, candidates, whereas, a, parliamentary, group, is, a, group, of, political, parties, a, political, faction, is, a, subgroup, within, a, political, party, and, an, advocacy, group, is, focused, on, advancing, a, policy, agenda, this, is, related, to, other, features, that, sometimes, distinguish, parties, from, other, political, organizations, including, a, larger, membership, greater, stability, over, time, and, a, deeper, connection, to, the, electorate, the, idea, of, people, forming, large, groups, or, factions, to, advocate, for, their, shared, interests, is, ancient, plato, mentions, the, political, factions, of, classical, athens, in, the, republic, and, aristotle, discusses, the, tendency, of, different, types, of, government, to, produce, factions, in, the, politics, certain, ancient, disputes, were, also, factional, like, the, nika, riots, between, two, chariot, racing, factions, at, the, hippodrome, of, constantinople, a, few, instances, of, recorded, political, groups, or, factions, in, history, included, the, late, roman, republic, s, populares, and, optimates, factions, as, well, as, the, dutch, republic, s, orangists, and, the, staatsgezinde, however, modern, political, parties, are, considered, to, have, emerged, around, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, they, are, usually, considered, to, have, first, appeared, in, europe, and, the, united, states, of, america, with, the, united, kingdom, s, conservative, party, and, the, democratic, party, of, the, united, states, both, frequently, called, the, world, s, oldest, continuous, political, party, before, the, development, of, mass, political, parties, elections, typically, featured, a, much, lower, level, of, competition, had, small, enough, polities, that, direct, decision, making, was, feasible, and, held, elections, that, were, dominated, by, individual, networks, or, cliques, that, could, independently, propel, a, candidate, to, victory, in, an, election, 510, some, scholars, argue, that, the, first, modern, political, parties, developed, in, early, modern, britain, in, the, 18th, century, after, the, exclusion, crisis, and, the, glorious, revolution, 4, the, whig, faction, originally, organized, itself, around, support, for, protestant, constitutional, monarchy, as, opposed, to, absolute, rule, whereas, the, conservative, tory, faction, originally, the, royalist, or, cavalier, faction, of, the, english, civil, war, supported, a, strong, monarchy, and, these, two, groups, structured, disputes, in, the, politics, of, the, united, kingdom, throughout, the, 18th, century, 4, the, rockingham, whigs, have, been, identified, as, the, first, modern, political, party, because, they, retained, a, coherent, party, label, and, motivating, principles, even, while, out, of, power, at, the, end, of, the, century, the, united, states, also, developed, a, party, system, called, the, first, party, system, although, the, framers, of, the, 1787, united, states, constitution, did, not, all, anticipate, that, american, political, disputes, would, be, primarily, organized, around, political, parties, political, controversies, in, the, early, 1790s, over, the, extent, of, federal, government, powers, saw, the, emergence, of, two, proto, political, parties, the, federalist, party, and, the, democratic, republican, party, by, the, early, 19th, century, a, number, of, countries, had, developed, stable, modern, party, systems, the, party, system, that, developed, in, sweden, has, been, called, the, world, s, first, party, system, on, the, basis, that, previous, party, systems, were, not, fully, stable, or, institutionalized, in, many, european, countries, including, belgium, switzerland, germany, and, france, political, parties, organized, around, a, liberal, conservative, divide, or, around, religious, disputes, 510, the, spread, of, the, party, model, of, politics, was, accelerated, by, the, 1848, revolutions, around, europe, the, strength, of, political, parties, in, the, united, states, waned, during, the, era, of, good, feelings, but, shifted, and, strengthened, again, by, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, this, was, not, the, only, country, in, which, the, strength, of, political, parties, had, substantially, increased, by, the, end, of, the, century, for, example, around, this, time, the, irish, political, leader, charles, stewart, parnell, implemented, several, methods, and, structures, like, party, discipline, that, would, come, to, be, associated, with, strong, grassroots, political, parties, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, in, europe, the, liberal, conservative, divide, that, characterized, most, party, systems, was, disrupted, by, the, emergence, of, socialist, parties, which, attracted, the, support, of, organized, trade, unions, 511, during, the, wave, of, decolonization, in, the, mid, 20th, century, many, newly, sovereign, countries, outside, of, europe, and, north, america, developed, party, systems, that, often, emerged, from, their, movements, for, independence, for, example, a, system, of, political, parties, arose, out, of, factions, in, the, indian, independence, movement, and, was, strengthened, and, stabilized, by, the, policies, of, indira, gandhi, in, the, 1970s, 165, the, formation, of, the, indian, national, congress, which, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, a, pro, independence, faction, in, british, india, and, immediately, became, a, major, political, party, after, indian, independence, foreshadowed, the, dynamic, in, many, newly, independent, countries, for, example, the, uganda, national, congress, was, a, pro, independence, party, and, the, first, political, party, in, uganda, and, its, name, was, chosen, as, an, homage, to, the, indian, national, congress, as, broader, suffrage, rights, and, eventually, universal, suffrage, slowly, spread, throughout, democracies, political, parties, expanded, dramatically, and, only, then, did, a, vision, develop, of, political, parties, as, intermediaries, between, the, full, public, and, the, government, political, parties, are, a, nearly, ubiquitous, feature, of, modern, countries, nearly, all, democratic, countries, have, strong, political, parties, and, many, political, scientists, consider, countries, with, fewer, than, two, parties, to, necessarily, be, autocratic, however, these, sources, allow, that, a, country, with, multiple, competitive, parties, is, not, necessarily, democratic, and, the, politics, of, many, autocratic, countries, are, organized, around, one, dominant, political, party, the, ubiquity, and, strength, of, political, parties, in, nearly, every, modern, country, has, led, researchers, to, remark, that, the, existence, of, political, parties, is, almost, a, law, of, politics, and, to, ask, why, parties, appear, to, be, such, an, essential, part, of, modern, states, 510, political, scientists, have, therefore, come, up, with, several, explanations, for, why, political, parties, are, a, nearly, universal, political, phenomenon, 11, one, of, the, core, explanations, for, the, existence, of, political, parties, is, that, they, arise, from, pre, existing, divisions, among, people, society, is, divided, in, a, certain, way, and, a, party, is, formed, to, organize, that, division, into, the, electoral, competition, by, the, 1950s, economists, and, political, scientists, had, shown, that, party, organizations, could, take, advantage, of, the, distribution, of, voters, preferences, over, political, issues, adjusting, themselves, in, response, to, what, voters, believe, in, order, to, become, more, competitive, beginning, in, the, 1960s, academics, began, identifying, the, social, cleavages, in, different, countries, that, might, have, given, rise, to, specific, parties, such, as, religious, cleavages, in, specific, countries, that, may, have, produced, religious, parties, there, the, theory, that, parties, are, produced, by, social, cleavages, has, drawn, several, criticisms, some, authors, have, challenged, it, on, empirical, grounds, either, finding, no, evidence, for, the, claim, that, parties, emerge, from, existing, cleavages, or, arguing, that, the, claim, is, not, empirically, testable, others, note, that, while, social, cleavages, might, cause, political, parties, to, exist, this, obscures, the, opposite, effect, that, political, parties, also, cause, changes, in, the, underlying, social, cleavages, 13, a, further, objection, is, that, if, the, explanation, for, where, parties, come, from, is, that, they, emerge, from, existing, social, cleavages, then, the, theory, is, an, incomplete, story, of, where, political, parties, come, from, unless, it, also, explains, the, origins, of, these, social, cleavages, an, alternative, explanation, for, why, parties, are, ubiquitous, across, the, world, is, that, the, formation, of, parties, provides, compatible, incentives, for, candidates, and, legislators, for, example, the, existence, of, political, parties, might, coordinate, candidates, across, geographic, districts, so, that, a, candidate, in, one, electoral, district, has, an, incentive, to, assist, a, similar, candidate, in, a, different, district, thus, political, parties, can, be, mechanisms, for, preventing, candidates, with, similar, goals, from, acting, to, each, other, s, detriment, when, campaigning, or, governing, this, might, help, explain, the, ubiquity, of, parties, if, a, group, of, candidates, form, a, party, and, are, harming, each, other, less, they, may, perform, better, over, the, long, run, than, unaffiliated, politicians, so, politicians, with, party, affiliations, will, out, compete, politicians, without, parties, parties, can, also, align, their, member, s, incentives, when, those, members, are, in, a, legislature, the, existence, of, a, party, apparatus, can, help, coalitions, of, electors, to, agree, on, ideal, policy, choices, whereas, a, legislature, of, unaffiliated, members, might, never, be, able, to, agree, on, a, single, best, policy, choice, without, some, institution, constraining, their, options, another, prominent, explanation, for, why, political, parties, exist, is, psychological, parties, may, be, necessary, for, many, individuals, to, participate, in, politics, because, they, provide, a, massively, simplifying, heuristic, which, allows, people, to, make, informed, choices, with, much, less, mental, effort, than, if, voters, had, to, consciously, evaluate, the, merits, of, every, candidate, individually, without, political, parties, electors, would, have, to, individually, evaluate, every, candidate, in, every, election, parties, enable, electors, to, make, judgments, about, just, a, few, groups, and, then, apply, their, judgment, of, the, party, to, its, entire, slate, of, candidates, because, it, is, much, easier, to, become, informed, about, a, few, parties, platforms, than, the, positions, of, a, multitude, of, independent, candidates, parties, reduce, the, cognitive, burden, for, people, to, cast, informed, votes, however, some, evidence, suggests, that, over, the, last, several, decades, the, strength, of, party, identification, has, been, weakening, so, this, may, be, a, less, important, function, for, parties, to, provide, than, it, was, in, the, past, political, parties, are, often, structured, in, similar, ways, across, countries, they, typically, feature, a, single, party, leader, a, group, of, party, executives, and, a, community, of, party, members, parties, in, democracies, usually, select, their, party, leadership, in, ways, that, are, more, open, and, competitive, than, parties, in, autocracies, where, the, selection, of, a, new, party, leader, is, likely, to, be, tightly, controlled, in, countries, with, large, sub, national, regions, particularly, federalist, countries, there, may, be, regional, party, leaders, and, regional, party, members, in, addition, to, the, national, membership, and, leadership, 75, parties, are, typically, led, by, a, party, leader, who, serves, as, the, main, representative, of, the, party, and, often, has, primary, responsibility, for, overseeing, the, party, s, policies, and, strategies, the, leader, of, the, party, that, controls, the, government, usually, becomes, the, head, of, government, such, as, the, president, or, prime, minister, and, the, leaders, of, other, parties, explicitly, compete, to, become, the, head, of, government, in, both, presidential, democracies, and, parliamentary, democracies, the, members, of, a, party, frequently, have, substantial, input, into, the, selection, of, party, leaders, for, example, by, voting, on, party, leadership, at, a, party, conference, because, the, leader, of, a, major, party, is, a, powerful, and, visible, person, many, party, leaders, are, well, known, career, politicians, party, leaders, can, be, sufficiently, prominent, that, they, affect, voters, perceptions, of, the, entire, party, and, some, voters, decide, how, to, vote, in, elections, partly, based, on, how, much, they, like, the, leaders, of, the, different, parties, the, number, of, people, involved, in, choosing, party, leaders, varies, widely, across, parties, and, across, countries, on, one, extreme, party, leaders, might, be, selected, from, the, entire, electorate, on, the, opposite, extreme, they, might, be, selected, by, just, one, individual, selection, by, a, smaller, group, can, be, a, feature, of, party, leadership, transitions, in, more, autocratic, countries, where, the, existence, of, political, parties, may, be, severely, constrained, to, only, one, legal, political, party, or, only, one, competitive, party, some, of, these, parties, like, the, chinese, communist, party, have, rigid, methods, for, selecting, the, next, party, leader, which, involves, selection, by, other, party, members, a, small, number, of, single, party, states, have, hereditary, succession, where, party, leadership, is, inherited, by, the, child, of, an, outgoing, party, leader, autocratic, parties, use, more, restrictive, selection, methods, to, avoid, having, major, shifts, in, the, regime, as, a, result, of, successions, in, both, democratic, and, non, democratic, countries, the, party, leader, is, often, the, foremost, member, of, a, larger, party, leadership, a, party, executive, will, commonly, include, administrative, positions, like, a, party, secretary, and, a, party, chair, who, may, be, different, people, from, the, party, leader, these, executive, organizations, may, serve, to, constrain, the, party, leader, especially, if, that, leader, is, an, autocrat, it, is, common, for, political, parties, to, conduct, major, leadership, decisions, like, selecting, a, party, executive, and, setting, their, policy, goals, during, regular, party, conferences, much, as, party, leaders, who, are, not, in, power, are, usually, at, least, nominally, competing, to, become, the, head, of, government, the, entire, party, executive, may, be, competing, for, various, positions, in, the, government, for, example, in, westminster, systems, the, largest, party, that, is, out, of, power, will, form, the, official, opposition, in, parliament, and, select, a, shadow, cabinet, which, among, other, functions, provides, a, signal, about, which, members, of, the, party, would, hold, which, positions, in, the, government, if, the, party, were, to, win, an, election, citizens, in, a, democracy, will, often, affiliate, with, a, specific, political, party, party, membership, may, include, paying, dues, an, agreement, not, to, affiliate, with, multiple, parties, at, the, same, time, and, sometimes, a, statement, of, agreement, with, the, party, s, policies, and, platform, in, democratic, countries, members, of, political, parties, often, are, allowed, to, participate, in, elections, to, choose, the, party, leadership, party, members, may, form, the, base, of, the, volunteer, activists, and, donors, who, support, political, parties, during, campaigns, the, extent, of, participation, in, party, organizations, can, be, affected, by, a, country, s, political, institutions, with, certain, electoral, systems, and, party, systems, encouraging, higher, party, membership, since, at, least, the, 1980s, membership, in, large, traditional, party, organizations, has, been, steadily, declining, across, a, number, of, countries, particularly, longstanding, european, democracies, political, scientists, have, distinguished, between, different, types, of, political, parties, that, have, evolved, throughout, history, these, include, elite, parties, mass, parties, catch, all, parties, and, cartel, parties, 163, 178, elite, parties, were, political, elites, that, were, concerned, with, contesting, elections, and, restricted, the, influence, of, outsiders, who, were, only, required, to, assist, in, election, campaigns, mass, parties, tried, to, recruit, new, members, who, were, a, source, of, party, income, and, were, often, expected, to, spread, party, ideology, as, well, as, assist, in, elections, in, the, united, states, where, both, major, parties, were, elite, parties, the, introduction, of, primaries, and, other, reforms, has, transformed, them, so, that, power, is, held, by, activists, who, compete, over, influence, and, nomination, of, candidates, an, elite, party, is, a, type, of, political, party, that, was, dominant, in, the, nineteenth, century, before, the, introduction, of, universal, suffrage, the, french, political, scientist, maurice, duverger, first, distinguished, between, elite, and, mass, parties, founding, his, distinction, on, the, differences, within, the, organisational, structures, of, these, two, types, 60, 71, elite, parties, are, characterized, by, minimal, and, loose, organisation, and, are, financed, by, fewer, larger, monetary, contributions, typically, originating, from, outside, the, party, elite, parties, give, little, priority, to, expanding, the, party, s, membership, base, and, its, leaders, are, its, only, members, 165, the, earliest, political, parties, such, as, the, democratic, republicans, and, the, federalists, are, classified, as, elite, parties, a, mass, party, is, a, type, of, political, party, that, developed, around, cleavages, in, society, and, mobilized, the, ordinary, citizens, or, masses, in, the, political, process, in, europe, the, introduction, of, universal, suffrage, resulted, in, the, creation, of, worker, s, parties, that, later, evolved, into, mass, parties, an, example, is, the, german, social, democratic, party, 165, these, parties, represented, large, groups, of, citizens, who, had, not, previously, been, represented, in, political, processes, articulating, the, interests, of, different, groups, in, society, in, contrast, to, elite, parties, mass, parties, are, funded, by, their, members, and, rely, on, and, maintain, a, large, membership, base, further, mass, parties, prioritize, the, mobilization, of, voters, and, are, more, centralized, than, elite, parties, the, term, catch, all, party, was, developed, by, german, american, political, scientist, otto, kirchheimer, to, describe, the, parties, that, developed, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, as, a, result, of, changes, within, the, mass, parties, 165, the, term, big, tent, party, may, be, used, interchangeably, kirchheimer, characterized, the, shift, from, the, traditional, mass, parties, to, catch, all, parties, as, a, set, of, developments, including, the, drastic, reduction, of, the, party, s, ideological, baggage, and, the, downgrading, of, the, role, of, the, individual, party, member, by, broadening, their, central, ideologies, into, more, open, ended, ones, catch, all, parties, seek, to, secure, the, support, of, a, wider, section, of, the, population, further, the, role, of, members, is, reduced, as, catch, all, parties, are, financed, in, part, by, the, state, or, by, donations, 163, 178, in, europe, the, shift, of, christian, democratic, parties, that, were, organized, around, religion, into, broader, centre, right, parties, epitomizes, this, type, cartel, parties, are, a, type, of, political, party, that, emerged, post, 1970s, and, are, characterized, by, heavy, state, financing, and, the, diminished, role, of, ideology, as, an, organizing, principle, the, cartel, party, thesis, was, developed, by, richard, katz, and, peter, mair, who, wrote, that, political, parties, have, turned, into, semi, state, agencies, acting, on, behalf, of, the, state, rather, than, groups, in, society, the, term, cartel, refers, to, the, way, in, which, prominent, parties, in, government, make, it, difficult, for, new, parties, to, enter, as, such, forming, a, cartel, of, established, parties, as, with, catch, all, parties, the, role, of, members, in, cartel, parties, is, largely, insignificant, as, parties, use, the, resources, of, the, state, to, maintain, their, position, within, the, political, system, 163, 178, niche, parties, are, a, type, of, political, party, that, developed, on, the, basis, of, the, emergence, of, new, cleavages, and, issues, in, politics, such, as, immigration, and, the, environment, in, contrast, to, mainstream, or, catch, all, parties, niche, parties, articulate, an, often, limited, set, of, interests, in, a, way, that, does, not, conform, to, the, dominant, economic, left, right, divide, in, politics, in, turn, emphasising, issues, that, do, not, attain, prominence, within, the, other, parties, further, niche, parties, do, not, respond, to, changes, in, public, opinion, to, the, extent, that, mainstream, parties, do, examples, of, niche, parties, include, green, parties, and, extreme, nationalist, parties, such, as, the, national, rally, in, france, however, over, time, these, parties, may, grow, in, size, and, shed, some, of, their, niche, qualities, as, they, become, larger, a, phenonmenon, observable, among, european, green, parties, during, their, transformation, from, radical, environmentalist, movements, to, mainstream, centre, left, parties, an, entrepreneurial, party, is, a, political, party, that, is, centered, on, a, political, entrepreneur, and, dedicated, to, the, advancement, of, that, person, or, their, policies, while, some, definitions, of, political, parties, state, that, a, party, is, an, organization, that, advances, a, specific, set, of, ideological, or, policy, goals, many, political, parties, are, not, primarily, motivated, by, ideology, or, policy, and, instead, exist, to, advance, the, career, of, a, specific, political, entrepreneur, political, ideologies, are, one, of, the, major, organizing, features, of, political, parties, and, parties, often, officially, align, themselves, with, specific, ideologies, parties, adopt, ideologies, for, a, number, of, reasons, ideological, affiliations, for, political, parties, send, signals, about, the, types, of, policies, they, might, pursue, if, they, were, in, power, ideologies, also, differentiate, parties, from, one, another, so, that, voters, can, select, the, party, that, advances, the, policies, that, they, most, prefer, a, party, may, also, seek, to, advance, an, ideology, by, convincing, voters, to, adopt, its, belief, system, common, ideologies, that, can, form, a, central, part, of, the, identity, of, a, political, party, include, liberalism, conservatism, socialism, communism, anarchism, fascism, feminism, environmentalism, nationalism, fundamentalism, islamism, and, multiculturalism, liberalism, is, the, ideology, that, is, most, closely, connected, to, the, history, of, democracies, and, is, often, considered, to, be, the, dominant, or, default, ideology, of, governing, parties, in, much, of, the, contemporary, world, many, of, the, traditional, competitors, to, liberal, parties, are, conservative, parties, socialist, communist, feminist, anarchist, fascist, and, nationalist, parties, are, more, recent, developments, largely, entering, political, competitions, only, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, environmentalism, multiculturalism, and, certain, types, of, fundamentalism, became, prominent, towards, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, parties, can, sometimes, be, organized, according, to, their, ideology, using, an, economic, left, right, political, spectrum, however, a, simple, left, right, economic, axis, does, not, fully, capture, the, variation, in, party, ideologies, other, common, axes, that, are, used, to, compare, the, ideologies, of, political, parties, include, ranges, from, liberal, to, authoritarian, from, pro, establishment, to, anti, establishment, and, from, tolerant, and, pluralistic, in, their, behavior, while, participating, in, the, political, arena, to, anti, system, party, positions, for, individual, political, parties, are, assessed, by, different, published, indices, such, as, the, v, party, dataset, though, ideologies, are, central, to, a, large, number, of, political, parties, around, the, world, not, all, political, parties, have, an, organizing, ideology, or, exist, to, promote, ideological, policies, for, example, some, political, parties, may, be, clientelistic, or, patronage, based, organizations, which, are, largely, concerned, with, distributing, goods, other, political, parties, may, be, created, as, tools, for, the, advancement, of, an, individual, politician, it, is, also, common, in, countries, with, important, social, cleavages, along, ethnic, or, racial, lines, to, represent, the, interests, of, one, ethnic, group, or, another, this, may, involve, a, non, ideological, attachment, to, the, interests, of, that, group, or, may, be, a, commitment, based, on, an, ideology, like, identity, politics, while, any, of, these, types, of, parties, may, be, ideological, there, are, political, parties, that, do, not, have, any, organizing, ideology, political, parties, are, ubiquitous, across, both, democratic, and, autocratic, countries, and, there, is, often, very, little, change, in, which, political, parties, have, a, chance, of, holding, power, in, a, country, from, one, election, to, the, next, this, makes, it, possible, to, think, about, the, political, parties, in, a, country, as, collectively, forming, one, of, the, country, s, central, political, institutions, called, a, party, system, some, basic, features, of, a, party, system, are, the, number, of, parties, and, what, sorts, of, parties, are, the, most, successful, these, properties, are, closely, connected, to, other, major, features, of, the, country, s, politics, such, as, how, democratic, it, is, what, sorts, of, restrictions, its, laws, impose, on, political, parties, and, what, type, of, electoral, systems, it, uses, even, in, countries, where, the, number, of, political, parties, is, not, officially, constrained, by, law, political, institutions, affect, how, many, parties, are, viable, for, example, democracies, that, use, a, single, member, district, electoral, system, tend, to, have, very, few, parties, whereas, countries, that, use, proportional, representation, tend, to, have, more, ch, 7, the, number, of, parties, in, a, country, can, also, be, accurately, estimated, based, on, the, magnitude, of, a, country, s, electoral, districts, and, the, number, of, seats, in, its, legislature, 255, an, informative, way, to, classify, the, party, systems, of, the, world, is, by, how, many, parties, they, include, because, some, party, systems, include, a, large, number, of, parties, that, have, a, very, low, probability, of, winning, elections, it, is, often, useful, to, think, about, the, effective, number, of, parties, the, number, of, parties, weighted, by, the, strength, of, those, parties, rather, than, the, literal, number, of, registered, parties, in, a, non, partisan, system, no, political, parties, exist, or, political, parties, are, not, a, major, part, of, the, political, system, there, are, very, few, countries, without, political, parties, in, some, non, partisan, countries, the, formation, of, parties, is, explicitly, banned, by, law, the, existence, of, political, parties, may, be, banned, in, autocratic, countries, in, order, to, prevent, a, turnover, in, power, for, example, in, saudi, arabia, a, ban, on, political, parties, has, been, used, as, a, tool, for, protecting, the, monarchy, however, parties, are, also, banned, in, some, polities, that, have, long, democratic, histories, usually, in, local, or, regional, elections, of, countries, that, have, strong, national, party, systems, political, parties, may, also, temporarily, cease, to, exist, in, countries, that, have, either, only, been, established, recently, or, that, have, experienced, a, major, upheaval, in, their, politics, and, have, not, yet, returned, to, a, stable, system, of, political, parties, for, example, the, united, states, began, as, a, non, partisan, democracy, and, it, evolved, a, stable, system, of, political, parties, over, the, course, of, many, decades, ch, 4, a, country, s, party, system, may, also, dissolve, and, take, time, to, re, form, leaving, a, period, of, minimal, or, no, party, system, such, as, in, peru, following, the, regime, of, alberto, fujimori, however, it, is, also, possible, albeit, rare, for, countries, with, no, bans, on, political, parties, and, which, have, not, experienced, a, major, disruption, to, nevertheless, have, no, political, parties, there, are, a, small, number, of, pacific, island, democracies, such, as, palau, where, political, parties, are, permitted, to, exist, and, yet, parties, are, not, an, important, part, of, national, politics, in, a, one, party, system, power, is, held, entirely, by, one, political, party, when, only, one, political, party, exists, it, may, be, the, result, of, a, ban, on, the, formation, of, any, competing, political, parties, which, is, a, common, feature, in, authoritarian, states, for, example, the, communist, party, of, cuba, is, the, only, permitted, political, party, in, cuba, and, is, the, only, party, that, can, hold, seats, in, the, legislature, when, only, one, powerful, party, is, legally, permitted, to, exist, its, membership, can, grow, to, contain, a, very, large, portion, of, society, and, it, can, play, substantial, roles, in, civil, society, that, are, not, necessarily, directly, related, to, political, governance, one, example, of, this, is, the, chinese, communist, party, bans, on, competing, parties, can, also, ensure, that, only, one, party, can, ever, realistically, hold, power, even, without, completely, outlawing, all, other, political, parties, for, example, in, north, korea, more, than, one, party, is, officially, permitted, to, exist, and, even, to, seat, members, in, the, legislature, but, laws, ensure, that, the, workers, party, of, korea, retains, control, it, is, also, possible, for, countries, with, free, elections, to, have, only, one, party, that, holds, power, these, cases, are, sometimes, called, dominant, party, systems, or, particracies, scholars, have, debated, whether, or, not, a, country, that, has, never, experienced, a, transfer, of, power, from, one, party, to, another, can, nevertheless, be, considered, a, democracy, 23, there, have, been, periods, of, government, exclusively, or, entirely, by, one, party, in, some, countries, that, are, often, considered, to, have, been, democratic, and, which, had, no, official, legal, barriers, to, the, inclusion, of, other, parties, in, the, government, this, includes, recent, periods, in, botswana, japan, mexico, senegal, and, south, africa, 24, 27, it, can, also, occur, that, one, political, party, dominates, a, sub, national, region, of, a, democratic, country, that, has, a, competitive, national, party, system, one, example, is, the, southern, united, states, during, much, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, where, the, democratic, party, had, almost, complete, control, with, the, southern, states, being, functionally, one, party, regimes, though, opposition, parties, were, never, prohibited, in, several, countries, there, are, only, two, parties, that, have, a, realistic, chance, of, competing, to, form, government, one, current, example, of, a, two, party, system, is, the, united, states, where, the, national, government, has, for, much, of, the, country, s, history, exclusively, been, controlled, by, either, the, democratic, party, or, the, republican, party, other, examples, of, countries, which, have, had, long, periods, of, two, party, dominance, include, colombia, uruguay, malta, and, ghana, two, party, systems, are, not, limited, to, democracies, they, may, be, present, in, authoritarian, regimes, as, well, competition, between, two, parties, has, occurred, in, historical, autocratic, regimes, in, countries, including, brazil, and, venezuela, a, democracy, s, political, institutions, can, shape, the, number, of, parties, that, it, has, in, the, 1950s, maurice, duverger, observed, that, single, member, district, single, vote, plurality, rule, elections, tend, to, produce, two, party, systems, 217, and, this, phenomenon, came, to, be, known, as, duverger, s, law, whether, or, not, this, pattern, is, true, has, been, heavily, debated, over, the, last, several, decades, some, political, scientists, have, broadened, this, idea, to, argue, that, more, restrictive, political, institutions, of, which, first, past, the, post, is, one, example, tend, to, produce, a, smaller, number, of, political, parties, so, that, extremely, small, parties, systems, like, those, with, only, two, parties, tend, to, form, in, countries, with, very, restrictive, rules, two, party, systems, have, attracted, heavy, criticism, for, limiting, the, choices, that, electors, have, and, much, of, this, criticism, has, centered, around, their, association, with, restrictive, political, institutions, for, example, some, commentators, argue, that, political, institutions, in, prominent, two, party, systems, like, the, united, states, have, been, specifically, designed, to, ensure, that, no, third, party, can, become, competitive, criticisms, also, center, around, these, systems, tendencies, to, encourage, insincere, voting, and, to, facilitate, the, spoiler, effect, ch, 1, multi, party, systems, are, systems, in, which, more, than, two, parties, have, a, realistic, chance, of, holding, power, and, influencing, policy, a, very, large, number, of, systems, around, the, world, have, had, periods, of, multi, party, competition, and, two, party, democracies, may, be, considered, unusual, or, uncommon, compared, to, multi, party, systems, many, of, the, largest, democracies, in, the, world, have, had, long, periods, of, multi, party, competition, including, india, indonesia, pakistan, and, brazil, multi, party, systems, encourage, characteristically, different, types, of, governance, than, smaller, party, systems, for, example, by, often, encouraging, the, formation, of, coalition, governments, the, presence, of, many, competing, political, parties, is, usually, associated, with, a, greater, level, of, democracy, and, a, country, transitioning, from, having, a, one, party, system, to, having, a, many, party, system, is, often, considered, to, be, democratizing, authoritarian, countries, can, include, multi, party, competition, but, typically, this, occurs, when, the, elections, are, not, fair, for, this, reason, in, two, party, democracies, like, the, united, states, proponents, of, forming, new, competitive, political, parties, often, argue, that, developing, a, multi, party, system, would, make, the, country, more, democratic, however, the, question, of, whether, multi, party, systems, are, more, democratic, than, two, party, systems, or, if, they, enjoy, better, policy, outcomes, is, a, subject, of, substantial, disagreement, among, scholars, as, well, as, among, the, public, in, the, opposite, extreme, a, country, with, a, very, large, number, of, parties, can, experience, governing, coalitions, that, include, highly, ideologically, diverse, parties, that, are, unable, to, make, much, policy, progress, which, may, cause, the, country, to, be, unstable, and, experience, a, very, large, number, of, elections, examples, of, systems, that, have, been, described, as, having, these, problems, include, periods, in, the, recent, history, of, israel, italy, and, finland, multi, party, systems, are, often, viewed, as, fairer, or, more, representative, than, one, or, two, party, systems, but, they, also, have, downsides, like, the, likelihood, that, in, a, system, with, plurality, voting, the, winner, of, a, race, with, many, options, will, only, have, minority, support, some, multi, party, systems, may, have, two, parties, that, are, noticeably, more, competitive, than, the, other, parties, such, party, systems, have, been, called, two, party, plus, systems, which, refers, to, the, two, dominant, parties, plus, other, parties, that, exist, but, rarely, or, never, hold, power, in, the, government, such, parties, may, serve, a, crucial, factor, in, election, outcomes, it, is, also, possible, for, very, large, multi, party, systems, like, india, s, to, nevertheless, be, characterized, largely, by, a, series, of, regional, contests, that, realistically, have, only, two, competitive, parties, but, in, the, aggregate, can, produce, many, more, than, two, parties, that, have, major, roles, in, the, country, s, national, politics, many, of, the, activities, of, political, parties, involve, the, acquisition, and, allocation, of, funds, in, order, to, achieve, political, goals, the, funding, involved, can, be, very, substantial, with, contemporary, elections, in, the, largest, democracies, typically, costing, billions, or, even, tens, of, billions, of, dollars, much, of, this, expense, is, paid, by, candidates, and, political, parties, which, often, develop, sophisticated, fundraising, organizations, because, paying, for, participation, in, electoral, contests, is, such, a, central, democratic, activity, the, funding, of, political, parties, is, an, important, feature, of, a, country, s, politics, common, sources, of, party, funding, across, countries, include, dues, paying, party, members, advocacy, groups, and, lobbying, organizations, corporations, trade, unions, and, candidates, who, may, self, fund, activities, in, most, countries, the, government, also, provides, some, level, of, funding, for, political, parties, nearly, all, of, the, 180, countries, examined, by, the, international, institute, for, democracy, and, electoral, assistance, have, some, form, of, public, funding, for, political, parties, and, about, a, third, have, regular, payments, of, government, funds, that, goes, beyond, campaign, reimbursements, in, some, countries, public, funding, for, parties, depends, on, the, size, of, that, party, for, example, a, country, may, only, provide, funding, to, parties, which, have, more, than, a, certain, number, of, candidates, or, supporters, a, common, argument, for, public, funding, of, political, parties, is, that, it, creates, fairer, and, more, democratic, elections, by, enabling, more, groups, to, compete, whereas, many, advocates, for, private, funding, of, parties, argue, that, donations, to, parties, are, a, form, of, political, expression, that, should, be, protected, in, a, democracy, public, financing, of, political, parties, may, decrease, parties, pursuit, of, funds, through, corrupt, methods, by, decreasing, their, incentive, to, find, alternate, sources, of, funding, one, way, of, categorizing, the, sources, of, party, funding, is, between, public, funding, and, private, funding, another, dichotomy, is, between, plutocratic, and, grassroots, sources, parties, which, get, much, of, their, funding, from, large, corporations, may, tend, to, pursue, different, policies, and, use, different, strategies, than, parties, which, are, mostly, funded, through, small, donations, by, individual, supporters, private, funding, for, political, parties, can, also, be, thought, of, as, coming, from, internal, or, external, sources, this, distinguishes, between, dues, from, party, members, or, contributions, by, candidates, and, donations, from, entities, outside, of, the, party, like, non, members, corporations, or, trade, unions, internal, funding, may, be, preferred, because, external, sources, might, make, the, party, beholden, to, an, outside, entity, there, are, many, ways, in, which, political, parties, may, deploy, money, in, order, to, secure, better, electoral, outcomes, parties, often, spend, money, to, train, activists, recruit, volunteers, create, and, deploy, advertisements, conduct, research, and, support, for, their, leadership, in, between, elections, and, promote, their, policy, agenda, many, political, parties, and, candidates, engage, in, a, practice, called, clientelism, in, which, they, distribute, material, rewards, to, people, in, exchange, for, political, support, in, many, countries, this, is, illegal, though, even, where, it, is, illegal, it, may, nevertheless, be, widespread, in, practice, some, parties, engage, directly, in, vote, buying, in, which, a, party, gives, money, to, a, person, in, exchange, for, their, vote, though, it, may, be, crucial, for, a, party, to, spend, more, than, some, threshold, to, win, a, given, election, there, are, typically, diminishing, returns, for, expenses, during, a, campaign, once, a, party, has, crossed, a, particular, spending, threshold, additional, expenditures, might, not, increase, their, chance, of, success, fundraising, and, expenditures, by, political, parties, are, typically, regulated, by, governments, with, many, countries, regulations, focusing, on, who, can, contribute, money, to, parties, how, parties, money, can, be, spent, and, how, much, of, it, can, pass, through, the, hands, of, a, political, party, two, main, ways, in, which, regulations, affect, parties, are, by, intervening, in, their, sources, of, income, and, by, mandating, that, they, maintain, some, level, of, transparency, about, their, funding, one, common, type, of, restriction, on, how, parties, acquire, money, is, to, limit, who, can, donate, money, to, political, parties, for, example, people, who, are, not, citizens, of, a, country, may, not, be, allowed, to, make, contributions, to, that, country, s, political, parties, in, order, to, prevent, foreign, interference, it, is, also, common, to, limit, how, much, money, an, individual, can, give, to, a, political, party, each, election, similarly, many, governments, cap, the, total, amount, of, money, that, can, be, spent, by, each, party, in, an, election, transparency, regulations, may, require, parties, to, disclose, detailed, financial, information, to, the, government, and, in, many, countries, transparency, laws, require, those, disclosures, to, be, available, to, the, public, as, a, safeguard, against, potential, corruption, creating, implementing, and, amending, laws, regarding, party, expenses, can, be, extremely, difficult, since, governments, may, be, controlled, by, the, very, parties, that, these, regulations, restrict, nearly, all, political, parties, associate, themselves, with, specific, colours, and, symbols, primarily, to, aid, voters, in, identifying, recognizing, and, remembering, the, party, this, branding, is, particularly, important, in, polities, where, much, of, the, population, may, be, illiterate, so, that, someone, who, cannot, read, a, party, s, name, on, a, ballot, can, instead, identify, that, party, by, colour, or, logo, parties, of, similar, ideologies, will, often, use, the, same, colours, across, different, countries, colour, associations, are, useful, as, a, short, hand, for, referring, to, and, representing, parties, in, graphical, media, they, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, coalitions, and, alliances, between, political, parties, and, other, organizations, examples, include, purple, alliances, red, green, alliances, traffic, light, coalitions, pan, green, coalitions, and, pan, blue, coalitions, however, associations, between, colour, and, ideology, can, also, be, inconsistent, parties, of, the, same, ideology, in, different, countries, often, use, different, colours, and, sometimes, competing, parties, in, a, country, may, even, adopt, the, same, colours, these, associations, also, have, major, exceptions, for, example, in, the, united, states, red, is, associated, with, the, more, conservative, republican, party, while, blue, is, associated, with, the, more, left, leaning, democratic, party
