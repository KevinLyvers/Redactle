solidarity, or, solidarism, is, an, awareness, of, shared, interests, objectives, standards, and, sympathies, creating, a, psychological, sense, of, unity, of, groups, or, classes, solidarity, does, not, reject, individuals, and, sees, individuals, as, the, basis, of, society, it, refers, to, the, ties, in, a, society, that, bind, people, together, as, one, the, term, is, generally, employed, in, sociology, and, the, other, social, sciences, as, well, as, in, philosophy, and, bioethics, it, is, a, significant, concept, in, catholic, social, teaching, and, in, christian, democratic, political, ideology, although, closely, related, to, the, concept, of, charity, solidarity, aspires, to, change, whole, systems, not, merely, to, help, individuals, solidarity, is, also, one, of, six, principles, of, the, charter, of, fundamental, rights, of, the, european, union, and, december, 20, of, each, year, is, international, human, solidarity, day, recognized, as, an, international, observance, solidarity, is, not, mentioned, in, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, nor, in, the, united, nations, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, and, has, hence, lesser, legal, meaning, when, compared, to, basic, rights, concepts, of, solidarity, are, mentioned, in, the, universal, declaration, on, bioethics, and, human, rights, but, not, defined, clearly, as, biotechnology, and, biomedical, enhancement, research, and, production, increase, the, need, for, distinct, definition, of, solidarity, within, healthcare, system, frameworks, is, important, the, terms, solidaire, and, solidairement, already, appeared, in, french, legal, language, in, the, 16th, century, they, are, related, to, the, roman, legal, concept, in, solidum, which, was, derived, from, the, latin, word, solidus, meaning, on, behalf, of, the, whole, in, napoleon, s, code, solidarity, meant, the, joint, liability, of, debtors, towards, a, common, creditor, and, was, not, a, primary, legal, principle, conservatism, following, the, french, revolution, introduced, the, concept, of, solidarity, which, was, detached, from, the, legal, system, as, a, reaction, against, rapid, social, change, and, as, a, longing, for, a, stable, society, during, the, july, monarchy, pierre, leroux, a, utopian, socialist, who, is, also, said, to, have, coined, the, term, socialism, also, introduced, the, concept, of, non, legal, solidarity, auguste, comte, the, so, called, founder, of, sociology, adopted, the, concept, in, the, sense, of, social, interdependence, between, people, comte, linked, solidarity, to, the, concept, of, altruism, as, the, opposite, of, egoism, instead, of, emphasising, the, individual, altruism, emphasises, common, responsibility, and, solidarity, the, interpretations, of, pierre, leroux, and, auguste, comte, gave, rise, to, the, idea, of, a, specific, social, solidarity, as, the, basis, of, the, social, order, after, the, french, revolution, new, scientific, and, ideological, interpretations, of, solidarity, emerged, in, france, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, concept, took, on, sociological, mile, durkheim, economic, charles, gide, legal, l, on, duguit, and, political, l, on, bourgeois, variants, thinkers, with, different, emphases, shaped, the, meaning, of, the, concept, of, solidarity, to, suit, their, own, purposes, the, paris, communards, for, example, exchanged, the, revolutionary, slogan, of, fraternity, for, solidarity, some, french, liberal, economists, also, began, to, use, the, term, solidarity, but, they, changed, its, meaning, in, an, individualistic, direction, liberalists, argued, that, interdependence, between, people, meant, that, people, also, had, to, take, responsibility, for, their, actions, without, the, state, intervening, charles, gide, an, economist, who, opposed, liberalism, developed, his, own, interpretation, of, the, concept, and, even, proposed, solidarity, as, the, name, of, a, new, school, of, economics, through, these, stages, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, solidarity, had, become, a, generic, term, that, could, be, associated, with, almost, everything, that, was, considered, good, and, progressive, the, paris, world, fair, in, 1900, was, accompanied, by, a, congress, on, social, education, and, the, new, solidarity, the, catholic, church, also, began, to, use, the, popular, concept, of, solidarity, according, to, sociologist, steven, lukes, solidarity, played, a, role, in, france, at, the, time, that, was, almost, as, strong, and, influential, as, individualism, did, in, the, united, states, at, the, same, time, according, to, mile, durkheim, the, types, of, social, solidarity, correlate, with, types, of, society, durkheim, introduced, the, terms, mechanical, and, organic, solidarity, as, part, of, his, theory, of, the, development, of, societies, in, the, division, of, labour, in, society, 1893, in, a, society, exhibiting, mechanical, solidarity, its, cohesion, and, integration, comes, from, the, homogeneity, of, individuals, people, feel, connected, through, similar, work, educational, and, religious, training, and, lifestyle, mechanical, solidarity, normally, operates, in, traditional, small, scale, societies, in, tribal, society, solidarity, is, usually, based, on, kinship, ties, of, familial, networks, organic, solidarity, comes, from, the, interdependence, that, arises, from, specialization, of, work, and, the, complementarities, between, people, a, development, which, occurs, in, modern, and, industrial, societies, although, individuals, perform, different, tasks, and, often, have, different, values, and, interests, the, order, and, solidarity, of, society, depends, on, their, reliance, on, each, other, to, perform, their, specified, tasks, organic, refers, to, the, interdependence, of, the, component, parts, and, thus, social, solidarity, is, maintained, in, more, complex, societies, through, the, interdependence, of, its, component, parts, e, g, farmers, produce, the, food, to, feed, the, factory, workers, who, produce, the, tractors, that, allow, the, farmer, to, produce, the, food, although, the, concept, of, solidarity, had, already, been, used, in, the, labor, movement, in, the, mid, 19th, century, it, was, only, the, liberal, republicans, who, brought, solidarity, into, the, mainstream, of, french, political, debate, in, 1896, l, on, bourgeois, published, his, book, solidarit, which, introduced, the, concept, of, solidarity, into, political, language, bourgeois, s, solidarity, was, based, primarily, on, the, interdependence, between, people, a, double, edged, sword, that, produced, both, security, and, threats, on, the, other, hand, it, was, also, based, on, the, idea, of, social, debt, according, to, bourgeois, man, owes, society, the, technical, and, intellectual, capital, that, social, development, has, produced, for, him, bourgeois, also, introduced, the, term, solidarism, to, describe, a, political, ideology, based, on, solidarity, solidarism, was, a, precise, and, clear, structure, of, ideas, which, radicalism, was, also, able, to, assimilate, and, it, came, to, regard, it, as, its, own, ideological, expression, after, the, turn, of, the, century, bourgeois, solidarism, came, to, be, regarded, almost, as, an, official, idea, of, the, third, republic, his, solidarism, combined, elements, of, durkheim, s, theory, of, solidarity, with, the, theories, of, louis, pasteur, and, charles, darwin, and, constituted, an, alternative, to, the, confrontation, between, classical, liberalism, and, workers, collectivism, bourgeois, emphasised, the, solidarity, generated, by, interdependence, between, people, as, a, positive, factor, for, all, human, growth, solidarism, thus, combined, the, natural, interdependence, of, human, beings, with, solidarity, as, a, moral, goal, although, the, idea, of, solidarity, had, different, successors, and, interpretations, they, had, in, common, the, emphasis, on, both, the, social, responsibility, of, the, state, and, the, cooperation, of, citizens, solidarity, also, played, a, central, role, in, the, thinking, of, the, french, economist, charles, gide, 1847, 1932, gide, set, out, to, challenge, the, dominance, of, the, liberal, school, of, economics, in, france, his, thinking, was, influenced, by, both, biology, and, sociology, he, was, particularly, influenced, by, charles, fourier, who, had, criticised, the, social, ills, created, by, free, market, competition, solidarity, became, a, fundamental, concept, in, gide, s, thinking, he, found, manifestations, of, solidarity, in, nature, in, the, economy, and, in, the, social, interdependencies, of, society, but, for, him, solidarity, was, only, ethically, valuable, when, it, was, consciously, voluntary, he, created, his, own, national, economic, doctrine, called, solidarism, according, to, which, society, could, gradually, move, towards, a, cooperative, economy, in, which, workers, themselves, controlled, the, means, of, production, in, gide, s, thinking, the, values, and, goals, of, solidarity, could, be, pursued, through, cooperative, associations, the, voluntary, association, of, well, meaning, people, in, gide, s, solidarity, the, common, property, created, by, free, cooperative, associations, is, their, own, and, the, added, value, created, by, their, activities, is, returned, in, the, form, of, profit, sharing, solidarism, preserved, the, foundations, of, the, free, market, economic, system, and, also, accepted, differences, in, people, s, economic, status, however, large, income, disparities, were, not, in, line, with, the, idea, of, solidarity, as, gide, considered, them, to, break, the, ties, that, bind, the, individual, to, society, gide, is, considered, a, major, representative, of, the, french, historical, school, and, his, ideas, were, quite, different, from, the, mainstream, liberal, economics, of, the, time, gide, s, social, philosophy, was, close, to, that, of, l, on, walras, the, developer, of, neoclassical, general, equilibrium, theory, and, he, was, one, of, the, few, supporters, of, walras, during, his, lifetime, solidarity, is, still, the, core, value, underlying, cooperatives, today, alongside, self, reliance, ownership, equality, and, justice, cooperative, members, have, a, duty, to, emphasise, the, common, interest, and, to, ensure, that, all, members, are, treated, as, fairly, as, possible, in, addition, to, solidarity, with, its, own, members, the, cooperative, now, also, emphasises, social, responsibility, beyond, the, cooperative, itself, anarchist, theorist, peter, kropotkin, 1842, 1921, connected, the, biological, and, the, social, in, his, formulation, of, solidarity, in, his, most, famous, book, mutual, aid, a, factor, of, evolution, 1902, written, partly, in, response, to, huxleyan, social, darwinism, kropotkin, studied, the, use, of, cooperation, as, a, survival, mechanism, in, human, societies, at, their, various, stages, as, well, as, with, animals, according, to, him, mutual, aid, or, cooperation, within, a, species, has, been, an, important, factor, in, the, evolution, of, social, institutions, solidarity, is, essential, for, mutual, aid, supportive, activity, towards, other, people, does, not, result, from, the, expectation, of, reward, but, rather, from, instinctive, feelings, of, solidarity, in, his, introduction, to, the, book, kropotkin, wrote, the, number, and, importance, of, mutual, aid, institutions, which, were, developed, by, the, creative, genius, of, the, savage, and, half, savage, masses, during, the, earliest, clan, period, of, mankind, and, still, more, during, the, next, village, community, period, and, the, immense, influence, which, these, early, institutions, have, exercised, upon, the, subsequent, development, of, mankind, down, to, the, present, times, induced, me, to, extend, my, researches, to, the, later, historical, periods, as, well, especially, to, study, that, most, interesting, period, the, free, medieval, city, republics, whose, universality, and, influence, upon, our, modern, civilization, have, not, yet, been, duly, appreciated, and, finally, i, have, tried, to, indicate, in, brief, the, immense, importance, which, the, mutual, support, instincts, inherited, by, mankind, from, its, extremely, long, evolution, play, even, now, in, our, modern, society, which, is, supposed, to, rest, upon, the, principle, every, one, for, himself, and, the, state, for, all, but, which, it, never, has, succeeded, nor, will, succeed, in, realizing, kropotkin, advocated, an, alternative, economic, and, social, system, which, would, be, coordinated, through, a, horizontal, network, of, voluntary, associations, with, goods, distributed, in, compliance, with, the, physical, needs, of, the, individual, rather, than, according, to, labor, the, political, philosophy, of, the, early, twentieth, century, condensed, into, the, concept, of, solidarity, sought, to, offer, both, a, scientific, theory, of, social, interdependence, and, a, moral, solution, to, social, problems, according, to, some, scholars, the, emergence, of, this, new, rationality, was, made, possible, by, the, concept, of, social, risk, and, the, idea, and, technology, of, insurance, developed, to, manage, it, social, risk, is, defined, as, the, risk, to, a, group, of, people, statistically, speaking, which, is, caused, in, one, way, or, another, by, their, living, together, and, which, can, be, mitigated, by, a, technique, of, joint, and, several, liability, such, as, insurance, it, has, been, said, that, insurance, can, be, seen, as, one, of, the, institutions, of, the, social, contract, the, way, insurance, works, requires, individuals, to, take, a, collective, responsibility, or, the, events, they, feel, the, need, to, prepare, for, society, can, be, said, to, have, become, modern, when, insurance, becomes, social, insurance, and, when, thanks, to, the, techniques, and, institutions, of, insurance, the, insurance, model, becomes, both, a, symbolic, and, a, functional, basis, for, the, social, contract, solidarity, and, justice, are, key, principles, underpinning, the, insurance, system, according, to, risto, pelkonen, and, timo, somer, in, the, context, of, voluntary, personal, insurance, solidarity, means, that, the, insured, share, the, benefits, and, costs, between, themselves, while, justice, means, that, each, insured, contributes, to, the, costs, according, to, the, actuarial, probability, social, insurance, on, the, other, hand, is, available, to, all, citizens, regardless, of, their, choice, and, health, status, as, the, costs, are, covered, by, tax, revenues, and, statutory, contributions, solidarity, or, solidarism, is, widely, seen, as, the, central, foundation, of, the, welfare, state, among, other, things, the, advent, of, statutory, social, insurance, and, social, law, in, the, 20th, century, changed, social, thinking, and, enabled, the, breakthrough, of, the, solidarity, paradigm, the, emergence, of, solidarity, in, social, law, can, be, thought, of, as, being, based, on, the, norm, of, collective, provisioning, as, the, foundation, of, social, justice, on, the, other, hand, it, can, be, argued, that, the, justification, for, social, regulation, and, solidarity, is, not, necessarily, a, positive, normative, logic, but, rather, general, civil, rights, human, rights, are, intended, to, apply, equally, to, all, people, and, are, more, akin, to, a, legal, law, than, to, a, normative, logic, the, formation, of, welfare, policy, can, therefore, be, thought, of, as, being, based, on, human, and, civil, rights, with, a, completely, different, logic, rather, than, on, a, collective, norm, according, to, professor, heikki, ervast, however, three, basic, concepts, can, be, associated, with, nordic, welfare, states, macro, collectivism, universalism, and, solidarism, in, simple, terms, macro, collectivism, means, that, recipients, and, payers, of, transfers, do, not, need, to, know, each, other, universalism, means, that, the, social, protection, and, services, of, the, welfare, state, apply, to, all, citizens, solidarism, means, that, the, welfare, state, is, not, simply, an, instrument, designed, to, guarantee, social, peace, but, is, based, on, solidarity, human, dignity, and, equality, pauli, forma, associate, professor, of, social, policy, at, the, university, of, turku, has, summarised, the, central, role, of, solidarity, as, the, ethical, basis, of, the, welfare, state, in, a, nutshell, the, welfare, state, is, an, institution, of, collective, solidarity, in, other, words, a, welfare, state, is, a, democratic, and, prosperous, state, that, collectively, shows, solidarity, by, taking, responsibility, for, the, social, security, and, equality, of, its, citizens, and, for, helping, the, disadvantaged, the, welfare, state, can, be, said, to, be, the, invisible, hand, of, solidarity, in, the, same, way, that, the, invisible, hand, of, the, market, is, at, work, in, a, free, market, economy, a, solidarity, tax, is, a, fee, imposed, by, the, government, of, some, countries, to, finance, projects, that, serve, in, theory, to, unify, or, solidarize, the, country, it, is, usually, imposed, for, a, short, period, of, time, in, addition, on, income, tax, of, individuals, private, entrepreneurs, and, legal, entities, in, germany, the, solidarity, tax, was, first, introduced, after, german, reunification, the, tax, amounted, to, 7, 5, of, the, amount, of, income, tax, payable, for, individuals, and, income, tax, payable, for, legal, entities, it, was, later, abolished, and, reintroduced, from, 1995, to, december, 31, 1997, after, which, it, was, reduced, to, 5, 5, on, january, 1, 1998, the, legality, of, the, tax, was, repeatedly, challenged, but, it, was, recognized, by, the, german, federal, financial, court, as, not, contrary, to, the, german, constitution, the, long, term, assessment, of, the, solidarity, tax, was, considered, unconstitutional, in, germany, in, italy, the, solidarity, tax, was, first, introduced, in, 2012, all, individuals, whose, annual, gross, income, exceeds, 300, 000, are, required, to, pay, a, 3, tax, on, the, amount, exceeding, this, amount, in, france, the, solidarity, tax, on, wealth, was, introduced, in, 1981, in, september, 2017, the, french, government, abolished, the, solidarity, tax, and, replaced, it, with, a, wealth, tax, on, real, estate, starting, in, 2018, it, was, paid, by, all, citizens, and, married, couples, whose, property, exceeded, 1, 3, million, euros, on, january, 1, the, tax, ranged, from, 0, 5, to, 1, 5, of, the, value, of, property, exceeding, 800, 000, euros, in, 2013, the, solidarity, tax, was, also, introduced, in, the, czech, republic, in, response, to, economic, recession, and, was, cancelled, in, 2021, in, this, country, it, was, 7, for, all, residents, earning, more, than, czk, 100, 000, per, month, solidarity, is, discussed, in, philosophy, within, its, various, sub, fields, of, law, ethics, and, political, philosophy, ancient, philosophers, such, as, socrates, and, aristotle, discuss, solidarity, from, within, a, virtue, ethics, framework, because, in, order, to, live, a, good, life, one, must, perform, actions, and, behave, in, a, way, that, is, in, solidarity, with, the, community, an, approach, in, bioethics, is, to, identify, solidarity, as, a, three, tiered, practice, enacted, at, the, interpersonal, communal, and, contractual, and, legal, levels, this, approach, is, driven, by, the, quest, to, differentiate, between, the, diverse, applications, of, the, concept, and, to, clarify, its, meaning, both, historically, and, in, terms, of, its, potential, as, a, fruitful, concept, for, contemporary, moral, social, and, political, issues, the, modern, practice, of, bioethics, is, significantly, influenced, by, immanuel, kant, s, concept, of, the, categorical, imperative, pastor, and, philosopher, fritz, jahr, s, article, bio, ethics, a, review, of, the, ethical, relationships, of, humans, to, animals, and, plants, refines, kant, s, original, categorical, imperative, discourse, by, including, the, notion, of, the, bioethical, imperative, biomedical, technology, has, also, further, introduced, solidarity, as, the, pivotal, concept, in, bioethics, scholars, such, as, ori, levi, bring, attention, to, the, negative, implications, of, biomedical, enhancements, another, scholar, meulen, ter, ruud, discusses, the, application, of, solidarity, within, healthcare, systems, fritz, jahr, describes, bioethics, as, ultimately, made, up, of, academic, discipline, principle, and, virtue, this, echoes, back, to, the, influence, socrates, has, on, the, norms, of, bioethics, and, its, practices, jahr, utilizes, kant, s, categorical, imperative, to, demonstrate, the, obligatory, yet, innately, human, practice, of, the, bioethical, imperative, he, guiding, principle, for, our, actions, is, the, bioethical, imperative, respect, every, living, being, in, general, as, an, end, in, itself, and, treat, it, if, possible, as, such, as, it, arises, in, the, relationships, not, only, between, people, but, also, with, plants, and, other, animal, species, jahr, believes, that, in, order, to, practice, bioethics, one, must, be, in, solidarity, with, all, forms, of, life, if, one, only, decides, to, be, in, solidarity, in, humans, then, one, should, not, behave, virtuously, in, any, manner, solidarity, is, an, element, of, catholic, social, teaching, according, to, pope, francis, no, one, can, remain, insensitive, to, the, inequalities, that, persist, in, the, world, the, brazilian, people, particularly, the, humblest, among, you, can, offer, the, world, a, valuable, lesson, in, solidarity, a, word, that, is, too, often, forgotten, or, silenced, because, it, is, uncomfortable, i, would, like, to, make, an, appeal, to, those, in, possession, of, greater, resources, to, public, authorities, and, to, all, people, of, good, will, who, are, working, for, social, justice, never, tire, of, working, for, a, more, just, world, marked, by, greater, solidarity, the, church, s, teaching, on, solidarity, is, explained, in, the, compendium, of, the, social, doctrine, of, the, church, and, briefly, summarised, in, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church
