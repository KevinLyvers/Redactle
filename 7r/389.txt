the, korean, alphabet, known, as, hangul, or, hangeul, in, south, korea, english, h, n, u, l, hahn, gool, korean, korean, pronunciation, and, chos, n, g, l, in, north, korea, north, korean, pronunciation, is, the, modern, writing, system, for, the, korean, language, the, letters, for, the, five, basic, consonants, reflect, the, shape, of, the, speech, organs, used, to, pronounce, them, they, are, systematically, modified, to, indicate, phonetic, features, the, vowel, letters, are, systematically, modified, for, related, sounds, making, hangul, a, featural, writing, system, it, has, been, described, as, a, syllabic, alphabet, as, it, combines, the, features, of, alphabetic, and, syllabic, writing, systems, hangul, was, created, in, 1443, ce, by, sejong, the, great, fourth, king, of, the, joseon, dynasty, it, was, an, attempt, to, increase, literacy, by, serving, as, a, complement, or, alternative, to, the, logographic, sino, korean, hanja, which, had, been, used, by, koreans, as, their, primary, script, to, write, the, korean, language, since, as, early, as, the, gojoseon, period, spanning, more, than, a, thousand, years, and, ending, around, 108, bce, along, with, the, usage, of, classical, chinese, modern, hangul, orthography, uses, 24, basic, letters, 14, consonant, letters, and, 10, vowel, letters, there, are, also, 27, complex, letters, that, are, formed, by, combining, the, basic, letters, 5, tense, consonant, letters, 11, complex, consonant, letters, and, 11, complex, vowel, letters, four, basic, letters, in, the, original, alphabet, are, no, longer, used, 1, vowel, letter, and, 3, consonant, letters, korean, letters, are, written, in, syllabic, blocks, with, the, alphabetic, letters, arranged, in, two, dimensions, for, example, the, south, korean, city, of, seoul, is, written, as, not, the, syllables, begin, with, a, consonant, letter, then, a, vowel, letter, and, then, potentially, another, consonant, letter, called, a, batchim, korean, if, the, syllable, begins, with, a, vowel, sound, the, consonant, ng, acts, as, a, silent, placeholder, however, when, starts, a, sentence, or, is, placed, after, a, long, pause, it, marks, a, glottal, stop, syllables, may, begin, with, basic, or, tense, consonants, but, not, complex, ones, the, vowel, can, be, basic, or, complex, and, the, second, consonant, can, be, basic, complex, or, a, limited, number, of, tense, consonants, how, the, syllable, is, structured, depends, if, the, baseline, of, the, vowel, symbol, is, horizontal, or, vertical, if, the, baseline, is, vertical, the, first, consonant, and, vowel, are, written, above, the, second, consonant, if, present, but, all, components, are, written, individually, from, top, to, bottom, in, the, case, of, a, horizontal, baseline, as, in, traditional, chinese, and, japanese, writing, as, well, as, many, other, texts, in, east, asia, korean, texts, were, traditionally, written, top, to, bottom, right, to, left, as, is, occasionally, still, the, way, for, stylistic, purposes, however, korean, is, now, typically, written, from, left, to, right, with, spaces, between, words, serving, as, dividers, unlike, in, japanese, and, chinese, hangul, is, the, official, writing, system, throughout, korea, both, north, and, south, it, is, a, co, official, writing, system, in, the, yanbian, korean, autonomous, prefecture, and, changbai, korean, autonomous, county, in, jilin, province, china, hangul, has, also, seen, limited, use, by, speakers, of, the, cia, cia, language, in, indonesia, the, korean, alphabet, was, originally, named, hunminjeong, eum, by, king, sejong, the, great, in, 1443, hunminjeong, eum, is, also, the, document, that, explained, logic, and, science, behind, the, script, in, 1446, the, name, hangeul, was, coined, by, korean, linguist, ju, si, gyeong, in, 1912, the, name, combines, the, ancient, korean, word, han, meaning, great, and, geul, meaning, script, the, word, han, is, used, to, refer, to, korea, in, general, so, the, name, also, means, korean, script, it, has, been, romanized, in, multiple, ways, north, koreans, call, the, alphabet, chos, n, g, l, after, chos, n, the, north, korean, name, for, korea, a, variant, of, the, mccune, reischauer, system, is, used, there, for, romanization, until, the, mid, 20th, century, the, korean, elite, preferred, to, write, using, chinese, characters, called, hanja, they, referred, to, hanja, as, jinseo, meaning, true, letters, some, accounts, say, the, elite, referred, to, the, korean, alphabet, derisively, as, amkeul, meaning, women, s, script, and, ahaetgeul, meaning, children, s, script, though, there, is, no, written, evidence, of, this, supporters, of, the, korean, alphabet, referred, to, it, as, jeong, eum, meaning, correct, pronunciation, gungmun, meaning, national, script, and, eonmun, meaning, vernacular, script, koreans, primarily, wrote, using, classical, chinese, alongside, native, phonetic, writing, systems, that, predate, hangul, by, hundreds, of, years, including, idu, script, hyangchal, gugyeol, and, gakpil, however, many, lower, class, uneducated, koreans, were, illiterate, due, to, the, difficulty, of, learning, the, korean, and, chinese, languages, as, well, as, the, large, number, of, chinese, characters, that, are, used, to, promote, literacy, among, the, common, people, the, fourth, king, of, the, joseon, dynasty, sejong, the, great, personally, created, and, promulgated, a, new, alphabet, although, it, is, widely, assumed, that, king, sejong, ordered, the, hall, of, worthies, to, invent, hangul, contemporary, records, such, as, the, veritable, records, of, king, sejong, and, jeong, inji, s, preface, to, the, hunminjeongeum, haerye, emphasize, that, he, invented, it, himself, the, korean, alphabet, was, designed, so, that, people, with, little, education, could, learn, to, read, and, write, according, to, the, hunminjeongeum, haerye, edition, king, sejong, expressed, his, intention, to, understand, the, language, of, the, people, in, his, country, and, to, express, their, meanings, more, conveniently, in, writing, he, noted, that, the, shapes, of, the, traditional, chinese, characters, as, well, as, factors, such, as, the, thickness, stroke, count, and, order, of, strokes, in, calligraphy, were, extremely, complex, making, it, difficult, for, people, to, recognize, and, understand, them, individually, a, popular, saying, about, the, alphabet, is, a, wise, man, can, acquaint, himself, with, them, before, the, morning, is, over, even, a, stupid, man, can, learn, them, in, the, space, of, ten, days, the, project, was, completed, in, late, december, 1443, or, january, 1444, and, described, in, 1446, in, a, document, titled, hunminjeong, eum, the, proper, sounds, for, the, education, of, the, people, after, which, the, alphabet, itself, was, originally, named, the, publication, date, of, the, hunminjeongeum, october, 9, became, hangul, day, in, south, korea, its, north, korean, equivalent, chos, n, g, l, day, is, on, january, 15, another, document, published, in, 1446, and, titled, hunminjeong, eum, haerye, hunminjeong, eum, explanation, and, examples, was, discovered, in, 1940, this, document, explains, that, the, design, of, the, consonant, letters, is, based, on, articulatory, phonetics, and, the, design, of, the, vowel, letters, is, based, on, the, principles, of, yin, and, yang, and, vowel, harmony, after, the, creation, of, hangul, people, from, the, lower, class, or, the, commoners, had, a, chance, to, be, literate, they, learned, how, to, read, and, write, korean, not, just, the, upper, classes, and, literary, elite, they, learn, hangul, independently, without, formal, schooling, or, such, the, korean, alphabet, faced, opposition, in, the, 1440s, by, the, literary, elite, including, choe, manri, and, other, korean, confucian, scholars, they, believed, hanja, was, the, only, legitimate, writing, system, they, also, saw, the, circulation, of, the, korean, alphabet, as, a, road, to, break, away, from, sinosphere, as, well, as, a, threat, to, their, status, however, the, korean, alphabet, entered, popular, culture, as, king, sejong, had, intended, used, especially, by, women, and, writers, of, popular, fiction, king, yeonsangun, banned, the, study, and, publication, of, the, korean, alphabet, in, 1504, after, a, document, criticizing, the, king, was, published, similarly, king, jungjong, abolished, the, ministry, of, eonmun, a, governmental, institution, related, to, hangul, research, in, 1506, the, late, 16th, century, however, saw, a, revival, of, the, korean, alphabet, as, gasa, and, sijo, poetry, flourished, in, the, 17th, century, the, korean, alphabet, novels, became, a, major, genre, however, the, use, of, the, korean, alphabet, had, gone, without, orthographical, standardization, for, so, long, that, spelling, had, become, quite, irregular, in, 1796, the, dutch, scholar, isaac, titsingh, became, the, first, person, to, bring, a, book, written, in, korean, to, the, western, world, his, collection, of, books, included, the, japanese, book, sangoku, ts, ran, zusetsu, an, illustrated, description, of, three, countries, by, hayashi, shihei, this, book, which, was, published, in, 1785, described, the, joseon, kingdom, and, the, korean, alphabet, in, 1832, the, oriental, translation, fund, of, great, britain, and, ireland, supported, the, posthumous, abridged, publication, of, titsingh, s, french, translation, thanks, to, growing, korean, nationalism, the, gabo, reformists, push, and, western, missionaries, promotion, of, the, korean, alphabet, in, schools, and, literature, the, hangul, korean, alphabet, was, adopted, in, official, documents, for, the, first, time, in, 1894, elementary, school, texts, began, using, the, korean, alphabet, in, 1895, and, tongnip, sinmun, established, in, 1896, was, the, first, newspaper, printed, in, both, korean, and, english, after, the, japanese, annexation, which, occurred, in, 1910, japanese, was, made, the, official, language, of, korea, however, the, korean, alphabet, was, still, taught, in, korean, established, schools, built, after, the, annexation, and, korean, was, written, in, a, mixed, hanja, hangul, script, where, most, lexical, roots, were, written, in, hanja, and, grammatical, forms, in, the, korean, alphabet, japan, banned, earlier, korean, literature, from, public, schooling, which, became, mandatory, for, children, the, orthography, of, the, korean, alphabet, was, partially, standardized, in, 1912, when, the, vowel, arae, a, which, has, now, disappeared, from, korean, was, restricted, to, sino, korean, roots, the, emphatic, consonants, were, standardized, to, and, final, consonants, restricted, to, long, vowels, were, marked, by, a, diacritic, dot, to, the, left, of, the, syllable, but, this, was, dropped, in, 1921, a, second, colonial, reform, occurred, in, 1930, the, arae, a, was, abolished, the, emphatic, consonants, were, changed, to, and, more, final, consonants, were, allowed, making, the, orthography, more, morphophonemic, the, double, consonant, was, written, alone, without, a, vowel, when, it, occurred, between, nouns, and, the, nominative, particle, was, introduced, after, vowels, replacing, ju, si, gyeong, the, linguist, who, had, coined, the, term, hangul, to, replace, eonmun, or, vulgar, script, in, 1912, established, the, korean, language, research, society, later, renamed, the, hangul, society, which, further, reformed, orthography, with, standardized, system, of, hangul, in, 1933, the, principal, change, was, to, make, the, korean, alphabet, as, morphophonemically, practical, as, possible, given, the, existing, letters, a, system, for, transliterating, foreign, orthographies, was, published, in, 1940, japan, banned, the, korean, language, from, schools, and, public, offices, in, 1938, and, excluded, korean, courses, from, the, elementary, education, in, 1941, as, part, of, a, policy, of, cultural, assimilation, and, genocide, the, definitive, modern, korean, alphabet, orthography, was, published, in, 1946, just, after, korean, independence, from, japanese, rule, in, 1948, north, korea, attempted, to, make, the, script, perfectly, morphophonemic, through, the, addition, of, new, letters, and, in, 1953, syngman, rhee, in, south, korea, attempted, to, simplify, the, orthography, by, returning, to, the, colonial, orthography, of, 1921, but, both, reforms, were, abandoned, after, only, a, few, years, both, north, korea, and, south, korea, have, used, the, korean, alphabet, or, mixed, script, as, their, official, writing, system, with, ever, decreasing, use, of, hanja, especially, in, the, north, beginning, in, the, 1970s, hanja, began, to, experience, a, gradual, decline, in, commercial, or, unofficial, writing, in, the, south, due, to, government, intervention, with, some, south, korean, newspapers, now, only, using, hanja, as, abbreviations, or, disambiguation, of, homonyms, however, as, korean, documents, history, literature, and, records, throughout, its, history, until, the, contemporary, period, were, written, primarily, in, literary, chinese, using, hanja, as, its, primary, script, a, good, working, knowledge, of, chinese, characters, especially, in, academia, is, still, important, for, anyone, who, wishes, to, interpret, and, study, older, texts, from, korea, or, anyone, who, wishes, to, read, scholarly, texts, in, the, humanities, a, high, proficiency, in, hanja, is, also, useful, for, understanding, the, etymology, of, sino, korean, words, as, well, as, to, enlarge, one, s, korean, vocabulary, north, korea, instated, hangul, as, its, exclusive, writing, system, in, 1949, on, the, orders, of, kim, il, sung, of, the, workers, party, of, korea, and, officially, banned, the, use, of, hanja, systems, that, employed, hangul, letters, with, modified, rules, were, attempted, by, linguists, such, as, hsu, tsao, te, and, ang, ui, jin, to, transcribe, taiwanese, hokkien, a, sinitic, language, but, the, usage, of, chinese, characters, ultimately, ended, up, being, the, most, practical, solution, and, was, endorsed, by, the, ministry, of, education, of, taiwan, the, hunminjeong, eum, society, in, seoul, attempted, to, spread, the, use, of, hangul, to, unwritten, languages, of, asia, in, 2009, it, was, unofficially, adopted, by, the, town, of, baubau, in, southeast, sulawesi, indonesia, to, write, the, cia, cia, language, a, number, of, indonesian, cia, cia, speakers, who, visited, seoul, generated, large, media, attention, in, south, korea, and, they, were, greeted, on, their, arrival, by, oh, se, hoon, the, mayor, of, seoul, letters, in, the, korean, alphabet, are, called, jamo, there, are, 14, consonants, and, 10, vowels, used, in, the, modern, alphabet, they, were, first, named, in, hunmongjahoe, a, hanja, textbook, written, by, choe, sejin, additionally, there, are, 27, complex, letters, that, are, formed, by, combining, the, basic, letters, 5, tense, consonant, letters, 11, complex, consonant, letters, and, 11, complex, vowel, letters, in, typography, design, and, in, ime, automata, the, letters, that, make, up, a, block, are, called, jaso, the, chart, below, shows, all, 19, consonants, in, south, korean, alphabetic, order, with, revised, romanization, equivalents, for, each, letter, and, pronunciation, in, ipa, see, korean, phonology, for, more, is, silent, syllable, initially, and, is, used, as, a, placeholder, when, the, syllable, starts, with, a, vowel, and, are, never, used, syllable, finally, consonants, are, broadly, categorized, into, either, obstruents, sounds, produced, when, airflow, either, completely, stops, i, e, a, plosive, consonant, or, passes, through, a, narrow, opening, i, e, a, fricative, or, sonorants, sounds, produced, when, air, flows, out, with, little, to, no, obstruction, through, the, mouth, nose, or, both, the, chart, below, lists, the, korean, consonants, by, their, respective, categories, and, subcategories, all, korean, obstruents, are, voiceless, in, that, the, larynx, does, not, vibrate, when, producing, those, sounds, and, are, further, distinguished, by, degree, of, aspiration, and, tenseness, the, tensed, consonants, are, produced, by, constricting, the, vocal, cords, while, heavily, aspirated, consonants, such, as, the, korean, p, are, produced, by, opening, them, korean, sonorants, are, voiced, the, chart, below, shows, the, 21, vowels, used, in, the, modern, korean, alphabet, in, south, korean, alphabetic, order, with, revised, romanization, equivalents, for, each, letter, and, pronunciation, in, ipa, see, korean, phonology, for, more, yi, the, vowels, are, generally, separated, into, two, categories, monophthongs, and, diphthongs, monophthongs, are, produced, with, a, single, articulatory, movement, hence, the, prefix, mono, while, diphthongs, feature, an, articulatory, change, diphthongs, have, two, constituents, a, glide, or, a, semivowel, and, a, monophthong, there, is, some, disagreement, about, exactly, how, many, vowels, are, considered, korean, s, monophthongs, the, largest, inventory, features, ten, while, some, scholars, have, proposed, eight, or, nine, this, divergence, reveals, two, issues, whether, korean, has, two, front, rounded, vowels, i, e, and, y, and, secondly, whether, korean, has, three, levels, of, front, vowels, in, terms, of, vowel, height, i, e, whether, e, and, are, distinctive, actual, phonological, studies, done, by, studying, formant, data, show, that, current, speakers, of, standard, korean, do, not, differentiate, between, the, vowels, and, in, pronunciation, alphabetic, order, in, the, korean, alphabet, is, called, the, ganada, order, after, the, first, three, letters, of, the, alphabet, the, alphabetical, order, of, the, korean, alphabet, does, not, mix, consonants, and, vowels, rather, first, are, velar, consonants, then, coronals, labials, sibilants, etc, the, vowels, come, after, the, consonants, the, collation, order, of, korean, in, unicode, is, based, on, the, south, korean, order, the, order, from, the, hunminjeongeum, in, 1446, was, this, is, the, basis, of, the, modern, alphabetic, orders, it, was, before, the, development, of, the, korean, tense, consonants, and, the, double, letters, that, represent, them, and, before, the, conflation, of, the, letters, null, and, ng, thus, when, the, north, korean, and, south, korean, governments, implemented, full, use, of, the, korean, alphabet, they, ordered, these, letters, differently, with, north, korea, placing, new, letters, at, the, end, of, the, alphabet, and, south, korea, grouping, similar, letters, together, the, double, letters, are, placed, after, all, the, single, letters, except, the, null, initial, which, goes, at, the, end, all, digraphs, and, trigraphs, including, the, old, diphthongs, and, are, placed, after, the, simple, vowels, again, maintaining, choe, s, alphabetic, order, the, order, of, the, final, letters, is, none, means, there, is, no, final, letter, unlike, when, it, is, initial, this, is, pronounced, as, the, nasal, ng, which, occurs, only, as, a, final, in, the, modern, language, the, double, letters, are, placed, to, the, very, end, as, in, the, initial, order, but, the, combined, consonants, are, ordered, immediately, after, their, first, element, in, the, southern, order, double, letters, are, placed, immediately, after, their, single, counterparts, the, modern, monophthongal, vowels, come, first, with, the, derived, forms, interspersed, according, to, their, form, i, is, added, first, then, iotated, then, iotated, with, added, i, diphthongs, beginning, with, w, are, ordered, according, to, their, spelling, as, or, plus, a, second, vowel, not, as, separate, digraphs, the, order, of, the, final, letters, is, every, syllable, begins, with, a, consonant, or, the, silent, that, is, followed, by, a, vowel, e, g, some, syllables, such, as, and, have, a, final, consonant, or, final, consonant, cluster, thus, 399, combinations, are, possible, for, two, letter, syllables, and, 10, 773, possible, combinations, for, syllables, with, more, than, two, letters, 27, possible, final, endings, for, a, total, of, 11, 172, possible, combinations, of, korean, alphabet, letters, to, form, syllables, the, sort, order, including, archaic, hangul, letters, defined, in, the, south, korean, national, standard, ks, x, 1026, 1, is, letters, in, the, korean, alphabet, were, named, by, korean, linguist, choe, sejin, in, 1527, south, korea, uses, choe, s, traditional, names, most, of, which, follow, the, format, of, letter, i, eu, letter, choe, described, these, names, by, listing, hanja, characters, with, similar, pronunciations, however, as, the, syllables, euk, eut, and, eut, did, not, occur, in, hanja, choe, gave, those, letters, the, modified, names, gi, yeok, di, geut, and, si, ot, using, hanja, that, did, not, fit, the, pattern, for, or, native, korean, syllables, for, and, originally, choe, gave, and, the, irregular, one, syllable, names, of, ji, chi, i, i, p, i, and, hi, because, they, should, not, be, used, as, final, consonants, as, specified, in, hunminjeongeum, however, after, establishment, of, the, new, orthography, in, 1933, which, let, all, consonants, be, used, as, finals, the, names, changed, to, the, present, forms, the, chart, below, shows, names, used, in, north, korea, for, consonants, in, the, korean, alphabet, the, letters, are, arranged, in, north, korean, alphabetic, order, and, the, letter, names, are, romanised, with, the, mccune, reischauer, system, which, is, widely, used, in, north, korea, the, tense, consonants, are, described, with, the, word, toen, meaning, hard, in, north, korea, an, alternative, way, to, refer, to, a, consonant, is, letter, for, example, g, for, the, letter, and, ss, for, the, letter, as, in, south, korea, the, names, of, vowels, in, the, korean, alphabet, are, the, same, as, the, sound, of, each, vowel, the, chart, below, shows, names, used, in, south, korea, for, consonants, of, the, korean, alphabet, the, letters, are, arranged, in, the, south, korean, alphabetic, order, and, the, letter, names, are, romanised, in, the, revised, romanization, system, which, is, the, official, romanization, system, of, south, korea, the, tense, consonants, are, described, with, the, word, ssang, meaning, double, letters, in, the, korean, alphabet, have, adopted, certain, rules, of, chinese, calligraphy, although, and, use, a, circle, which, is, not, used, in, printed, chinese, characters, for, the, iotated, vowels, which, are, not, shown, the, short, stroke, is, simply, doubled, scripts, typically, transcribe, languages, at, the, level, of, morphemes, logographic, scripts, like, hanja, of, syllables, syllabaries, like, kana, of, segments, alphabetic, scripts, like, the, latin, script, used, to, write, english, and, many, other, languages, or, on, occasion, of, distinctive, features, the, korean, alphabet, incorporates, aspects, of, the, latter, three, grouping, sounds, into, syllables, using, distinct, symbols, for, segments, and, in, some, cases, using, distinct, strokes, to, indicate, distinctive, features, such, as, place, of, articulation, labial, coronal, velar, or, glottal, and, manner, of, articulation, plosive, nasal, sibilant, aspiration, for, consonants, and, iotation, a, preceding, i, sound, harmonic, class, and, i, mutation, for, vowels, for, instance, the, consonant, is, composed, of, three, strokes, each, one, meaningful, the, top, stroke, indicates, is, a, plosive, like, g, d, j, which, have, the, same, stroke, the, last, is, an, affricate, a, plosive, fricative, sequence, the, middle, stroke, indicates, that, is, aspirated, like, h, ch, which, also, have, this, stroke, and, the, bottom, stroke, indicates, that, is, alveolar, like, n, d, and, l, it, is, said, to, represent, the, shape, of, the, tongue, when, pronouncing, coronal, consonants, though, this, is, not, certain, two, obsolete, consonants, and, have, dual, pronunciations, and, appear, to, be, composed, of, two, elements, corresponding, to, these, two, pronunciations, silence, for, and, for, with, vowel, letters, a, short, stroke, connected, to, the, main, line, of, the, letter, indicates, that, this, is, one, of, the, vowels, that, can, be, iotated, this, stroke, is, then, doubled, when, the, vowel, is, iotated, the, position, of, the, stroke, indicates, which, harmonic, class, the, vowel, belongs, to, light, top, or, right, or, dark, bottom, or, left, in, the, modern, alphabet, an, additional, vertical, stroke, indicates, i, mutation, deriving, and, from, and, however, this, is, not, part, of, the, intentional, design, of, the, script, but, rather, a, natural, development, from, what, were, originally, diphthongs, ending, in, the, vowel, indeed, in, many, korean, dialects, including, the, standard, dialect, of, seoul, some, of, these, may, still, be, diphthongs, for, example, in, the, seoul, dialect, may, alternatively, be, pronounced, and, note, as, a, morpheme, is, combined, with, as, a, vertical, stroke, as, a, phoneme, its, sound, is, not, by, i, mutation, of, beside, the, letters, the, korean, alphabet, originally, employed, diacritic, marks, to, indicate, pitch, accent, a, syllable, with, a, high, pitch, was, marked, with, a, dot, to, the, left, of, it, when, writing, vertically, a, syllable, with, a, rising, pitch, was, marked, with, a, double, dot, like, a, colon, these, are, no, longer, used, as, modern, seoul, korean, has, lost, tonality, vowel, length, has, also, been, neutralized, in, modern, korean, and, is, no, longer, written, the, consonant, letters, fall, into, five, homorganic, groups, each, with, a, basic, shape, and, one, or, more, letters, derived, from, this, shape, by, means, of, additional, strokes, in, the, hunmin, jeong, eum, haerye, account, the, basic, shapes, iconically, represent, the, articulations, the, tongue, palate, teeth, and, throat, take, when, making, these, sounds, vowel, letters, are, based, on, three, elements, short, strokes, dots, in, the, earliest, documents, were, added, to, these, three, basic, elements, to, derive, the, vowel, letter, the, korean, alphabet, does, not, have, a, letter, for, w, sound, since, an, o, or, u, before, an, a, or, eo, became, a, sound, and, occurred, nowhere, else, could, always, be, analyzed, as, a, phonemic, o, or, u, and, no, letter, for, was, needed, however, vowel, harmony, is, observed, dark, u, with, dark, eo, for, wo, bright, o, with, bright, a, for, wa, the, compound, vowels, ending, in, i, were, originally, diphthongs, however, several, have, since, evolved, into, pure, vowels, there, is, no, letter, for, y, instead, this, sound, is, indicated, by, doubling, the, stroke, attached, to, the, baseline, of, the, vowel, letter, of, the, seven, basic, vowels, four, could, be, preceded, by, a, y, sound, and, these, four, were, written, as, a, dot, next, to, a, line, through, the, influence, of, chinese, calligraphy, the, dots, soon, became, connected, to, the, line, a, preceding, y, sound, called, iotation, was, indicated, by, doubling, this, dot, yeo, ya, yu, yo, the, three, vowels, that, could, not, be, iotated, were, written, with, a, single, stroke, eu, arae, a, i, the, simple, iotated, vowels, are, there, are, also, two, iotated, diphthongs, the, korean, language, of, the, 15th, century, had, vowel, harmony, to, a, greater, extent, than, it, does, today, vowels, in, grammatical, morphemes, changed, according, to, their, environment, falling, into, groups, that, harmonized, with, each, other, this, affected, the, morphology, of, the, language, and, korean, phonology, described, it, in, terms, of, yin, and, yang, if, a, root, word, had, yang, bright, vowels, then, most, suffixes, attached, to, it, also, had, to, have, yang, vowels, conversely, if, the, root, had, yin, dark, vowels, the, suffixes, had, to, be, yin, as, well, there, was, a, third, harmonic, group, called, mediating, neutral, in, western, terminology, that, could, coexist, with, either, yin, or, yang, vowels, the, korean, neutral, vowel, was, i, the, yin, vowels, were, eu, u, eo, the, dots, are, in, the, yin, directions, of, down, and, left, the, yang, vowels, were, o, a, with, the, dots, in, the, yang, directions, of, up, and, right, the, hunmin, jeong, eum, haerye, states, that, the, shapes, of, the, non, dotted, letters, were, chosen, to, represent, the, concepts, of, yin, yang, and, mediation, earth, heaven, and, human, the, letter, is, now, obsolete, except, in, the, jeju, language, the, third, parameter, in, designing, the, vowel, letters, was, choosing, as, the, graphic, base, of, and, and, as, the, graphic, base, of, and, a, full, understanding, of, what, these, horizontal, and, vertical, groups, had, in, common, would, require, knowing, the, exact, sound, values, these, vowels, had, in, the, 15th, century, the, uncertainty, is, primarily, with, the, three, letters, some, linguists, reconstruct, these, as, a, e, respectively, others, as, e, a, a, third, reconstruction, is, to, make, them, all, middle, vowels, as, a, with, the, third, reconstruction, middle, korean, vowels, actually, line, up, in, a, vowel, harmony, pattern, albeit, with, only, one, front, vowel, and, four, middle, vowels, however, the, horizontal, letters, eu, u, o, do, all, appear, to, have, been, mid, to, high, back, vowels, and, thus, to, have, formed, a, coherent, group, phonetically, in, every, reconstruction, the, traditionally, accepted, account, on, the, design, of, the, letters, is, that, the, vowels, are, derived, from, various, combinations, of, the, following, three, components, here, symbolically, stands, for, the, sun, in, heaven, stands, for, the, flat, earth, and, stands, for, an, upright, human, the, original, sequence, of, the, korean, vowels, as, stated, in, hunminjeongeum, listed, these, three, vowels, first, followed, by, various, combinations, thus, the, original, order, of, the, vowels, was, two, positive, vowels, including, one, are, followed, by, two, negative, vowels, including, one, then, by, two, positive, vowels, each, including, two, of, and, then, by, two, negative, vowels, each, including, two, of, the, same, theory, provides, the, most, simple, explanation, of, the, shapes, of, the, consonants, as, an, approximation, of, the, shapes, of, the, most, representative, organ, needed, to, form, that, sound, the, original, order, of, the, consonants, in, hunminjeong, eum, was, although, the, hunminjeong, eum, haerye, explains, the, design, of, the, consonantal, letters, in, terms, of, articulatory, phonetics, as, a, purely, innovative, creation, several, theories, suggest, which, external, sources, may, have, inspired, or, influenced, king, sejong, s, creation, professor, gari, ledyard, of, columbia, university, studied, possible, connections, between, hangul, and, the, mongol, phags, pa, script, of, the, yuan, dynasty, he, however, also, believed, that, the, role, of, phags, pa, script, in, the, creation, of, the, korean, alphabet, was, quite, limited, stating, it, should, not, be, assumed, that, hangul, was, derived, from, phags, pa, script, based, on, his, theory, it, should, be, clear, to, any, reader, that, in, the, total, picture, that, role, was, quite, limited, nothing, would, disturb, me, more, after, this, study, is, published, than, to, discover, in, a, work, on, the, history, of, writing, a, statement, like, the, following, according, to, recent, investigations, the, korean, alphabet, was, derived, from, the, mongol, s, phags, pa, script, ledyard, posits, that, five, of, the, korean, letters, have, shapes, inspired, by, phags, pa, a, sixth, basic, letter, the, null, initial, was, invented, by, sejong, the, rest, of, the, letters, were, derived, internally, from, these, six, essentially, as, described, in, the, hunmin, jeong, eum, haerye, however, the, five, borrowed, consonants, were, not, the, graphically, simplest, letters, considered, basic, by, the, hunmin, jeong, eum, haerye, but, instead, the, consonants, basic, to, chinese, phonology, and, the, hunmin, jeong, eum, states, that, king, sejong, adapted, the, gojeon, g, seal, script, in, creating, the, korean, alphabet, the, has, never, been, identified, the, primary, meaning, of, g, is, old, old, seal, script, frustrating, philologists, because, the, korean, alphabet, bears, no, functional, similarity, to, chinese, zhu, nz, seal, scripts, however, ledyard, believes, g, may, be, a, pun, on, m, ngg, mongol, and, that, is, an, abbreviation, of, mongol, seal, script, that, is, the, formal, variant, of, the, phags, pa, alphabet, written, to, look, like, the, chinese, seal, script, there, were, phags, pa, manuscripts, in, the, korean, palace, library, including, some, in, the, seal, script, form, and, several, of, sejong, s, ministers, knew, the, script, well, if, this, was, the, case, sejong, s, evasion, on, the, mongol, connection, can, be, understood, in, light, of, korea, s, relationship, with, ming, china, after, the, fall, of, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty, and, of, the, literati, s, contempt, for, the, mongols, according, to, ledyard, the, five, borrowed, letters, were, graphically, simplified, which, allowed, for, consonant, clusters, and, left, room, to, add, a, stroke, to, derive, the, aspirate, plosives, but, in, contrast, to, the, traditional, account, the, non, plosives, were, derived, by, removing, the, top, of, the, basic, letters, he, points, out, that, while, it, is, easy, to, derive, from, by, removing, the, top, it, is, not, clear, how, to, derive, from, in, the, traditional, account, since, the, shape, of, is, not, analogous, to, those, of, the, other, plosives, the, explanation, of, the, letter, ng, also, differs, from, the, traditional, account, many, chinese, words, began, with, ng, but, by, king, sejong, s, day, initial, ng, was, either, silent, or, pronounced, in, china, and, was, silent, when, these, words, were, borrowed, into, korean, also, the, expected, shape, of, ng, the, short, vertical, line, left, by, removing, the, top, stroke, of, would, have, looked, almost, identical, to, the, vowel, sejong, s, solution, solved, both, problems, the, vertical, stroke, left, from, was, added, to, the, null, symbol, to, create, a, circle, with, a, vertical, line, on, top, iconically, capturing, both, the, pronunciation, in, the, middle, or, end, of, a, word, and, the, usual, silence, at, the, beginning, the, graphic, distinction, between, null, and, ng, was, eventually, lost, another, letter, composed, of, two, elements, to, represent, two, regional, pronunciations, was, which, transcribed, the, chinese, initial, this, represented, either, m, or, w, in, various, chinese, dialects, and, was, composed, of, plus, from, phags, pa, in, phags, pa, a, loop, under, a, letter, represented, w, after, vowels, and, ledyard, hypothesized, that, this, became, the, loop, at, the, bottom, of, in, phags, pa, the, chinese, initial, is, also, transcribed, as, a, compound, with, w, but, in, its, case, the, w, is, placed, under, an, h, actually, the, chinese, consonant, series, w, v, f, is, transcribed, in, phags, pa, by, the, addition, of, a, w, under, three, graphic, variants, of, the, letter, for, h, and, the, korean, alphabet, parallels, this, convention, by, adding, the, w, loop, to, the, labial, series, m, b, p, producing, now, obsolete, w, v, f, phonetic, values, in, korean, are, uncertain, as, these, consonants, were, only, used, to, transcribe, chinese, as, a, final, piece, of, evidence, ledyard, notes, that, most, of, the, borrowed, korean, letters, were, simple, geometric, shapes, at, least, originally, but, that, d, always, had, a, small, lip, protruding, from, the, upper, left, corner, just, as, the, phags, pa, d, did, this, lip, can, be, traced, back, to, the, tibetan, letter, d, there, is, also, the, argument, that, the, original, theory, which, stated, the, hangul, consonants, to, have, been, derived, from, the, shape, of, the, speaker, s, lips, and, tongue, during, the, pronunciation, of, the, consonants, initially, at, least, slightly, strains, credulity, hangul, supremacy, korean, or, hangul, scientific, supremacy, is, the, claim, that, the, hangul, alphabet, is, the, simplest, and, most, logical, writing, system, in, the, world, proponents, of, the, claim, believe, hangul, is, the, most, scientific, writing, system, because, its, characters, are, based, on, the, shapes, of, the, parts, of, the, human, body, used, to, enunciate, for, example, the, first, alphabet, is, shaped, like, the, root, of, the, tongue, blocking, the, throat, and, makes, a, sound, between, k, and, g, in, english, they, also, believe, that, hangul, was, designed, to, be, simple, to, learn, containing, only, 28, characters, in, its, alphabet, with, simplistic, rules, edwin, o, reischauer, and, john, k, fairbank, of, harvard, university, wrote, that, hangul, is, perhaps, the, most, scientific, system, of, writing, in, general, use, in, any, country, former, professor, of, leiden, university, frits, vos, stated, that, king, sejong, invented, the, world, s, best, alphabet, adding, it, is, clear, that, the, korean, alphabet, is, not, only, simple, and, logical, but, has, moreover, been, constructed, in, a, purely, scientific, way, numerous, obsolete, korean, letters, and, sequences, are, no, longer, used, in, korean, some, of, these, letters, were, only, used, to, represent, the, sounds, of, chinese, rime, tables, some, of, the, korean, sounds, represented, by, these, obsolete, letters, still, exist, in, dialects, ipa, last, w, f, s, z, t, s, t, t, s, t, f, aspirated, aspirated, ipa, z, d, z, d, ipa, also, commonly, found, in, the, jeju, language, closely, similar, to, vowel, eo, in, the, original, korean, alphabet, system, double, letters, were, used, to, represent, chinese, voiced, consonants, which, survive, in, the, shanghainese, slack, consonants, and, were, not, used, for, korean, words, it, was, only, later, that, a, similar, convention, was, used, to, represent, the, modern, tense, faucalized, consonants, of, korean, the, sibilant, dental, consonants, were, modified, to, represent, the, two, series, of, chinese, sibilants, alveolar, and, retroflex, a, round, vs, sharp, distinction, analogous, to, s, vs, sh, which, was, never, made, in, korean, and, was, even, being, lost, from, southern, chinese, the, alveolar, letters, had, longer, left, stems, while, retroflexes, had, longer, right, stems, to, make, the, korean, alphabet, a, better, morphophonological, fit, to, the, korean, language, north, korea, introduced, six, new, letters, which, were, published, in, the, new, orthography, for, the, korean, language, and, used, officially, from, 1948, to, 1954, two, obsolete, letters, were, restored, which, was, used, to, indicate, an, alternation, in, pronunciation, between, initial, l, and, final, d, and, which, was, only, pronounced, between, vowels, two, modifications, of, the, letter, were, introduced, one, which, is, silent, finally, and, one, which, doubled, between, vowels, a, hybrid, letter, was, introduced, for, words, that, alternated, between, those, two, sounds, that, is, a, b, which, became, w, before, a, vowel, finally, a, vowel, 1, was, introduced, for, variable, iotation, hangul, jamo, u, 1100, u, 11ff, and, hangul, compatibility, jamo, u, 3130, u, 318f, blocks, were, added, to, the, unicode, standard, in, june, 1993, with, the, release, of, version, 1, 1, a, separate, hangul, syllables, block, not, shown, below, due, to, its, length, contains, pre, composed, syllable, block, characters, which, were, first, added, at, the, same, time, although, they, were, relocated, to, their, present, locations, in, july, 1996, with, the, release, of, version, 2, 0, hangul, jamo, extended, a, u, a960, u, a97f, and, hangul, jamo, extended, b, u, d7b0, u, d7ff, blocks, were, added, to, the, unicode, standard, in, october, 2009, with, the, release, of, version, 5, 2, parenthesised, u, 3200, u, 321e, and, circled, u, 3260, u, 327e, hangul, compatibility, characters, are, in, the, enclosed, cjk, letters, and, months, block, half, width, hangul, compatibility, characters, u, ffa0, u, ffdc, are, in, the, halfwidth, and, fullwidth, forms, block, the, korean, alphabet, in, other, unicode, blocks, except, for, a, few, grammatical, morphemes, prior, to, the, twentieth, century, no, letter, stands, alone, to, represent, elements, of, the, korean, language, instead, letters, are, grouped, into, syllabic, or, morphemic, blocks, of, at, least, two, and, often, three, a, consonant, or, a, doubled, consonant, called, the, initial, choseong, syllable, onset, a, vowel, or, diphthong, called, the, medial, jungseong, syllable, nucleus, and, optionally, a, consonant, or, consonant, cluster, at, the, end, of, the, syllable, called, the, final, jongseong, syllable, coda, when, a, syllable, has, no, actual, initial, consonant, the, null, initial, ieung, is, used, as, a, placeholder, in, the, modern, korean, alphabet, placeholders, are, not, used, for, the, final, position, thus, a, block, contains, a, minimum, of, two, letters, an, initial, and, a, medial, although, the, korean, alphabet, had, historically, been, organized, into, syllables, in, the, modern, orthography, it, is, first, organized, into, morphemes, and, only, secondarily, into, syllables, within, those, morphemes, with, the, exception, that, single, consonant, morphemes, may, not, be, written, alone, the, sets, of, initial, and, final, consonants, are, not, the, same, for, instance, ng, only, occurs, in, final, position, while, the, doubled, letters, that, can, occur, in, final, position, are, limited, to, ss, and, kk, not, including, obsolete, letters, 11, 172, blocks, are, possible, in, the, korean, alphabet, the, placement, or, stacking, of, letters, in, the, block, follows, set, patterns, based, on, the, shape, of, the, medial, consonant, and, vowel, sequences, such, as, bs, wo, or, obsolete, bsd, ye, are, written, left, to, right, vowels, medials, are, written, under, the, initial, consonant, to, the, right, or, wrap, around, the, initial, from, bottom, to, right, depending, on, their, shape, if, the, vowel, has, a, horizontal, axis, like, eu, then, it, is, written, under, the, initial, if, it, has, a, vertical, axis, like, i, then, it, is, written, to, the, right, of, the, initial, and, if, it, combines, both, orientations, like, ui, then, it, wraps, around, the, initial, from, the, bottom, to, the, right, a, final, consonant, if, present, is, always, written, at, the, bottom, under, the, vowel, this, is, called, batchim, supporting, floor, a, complex, final, is, written, left, to, right, blocks, are, always, written, in, phonetic, order, initial, medial, final, therefore, normally, the, resulting, block, is, written, within, a, square, some, recent, fonts, for, example, eun, hy, m, and, unjamo, move, towards, the, european, practice, of, letters, whose, relative, size, is, fixed, and, use, whitespace, to, fill, letter, positions, not, used, in, a, particular, block, and, away, from, the, east, asian, tradition, of, square, block, characters, they, break, one, or, more, of, the, traditional, rules, in, korean, typefaces, that, do, not, have, a, fixed, block, boundary, size, are, called, tallemo, geulkkol, out, of, square, typeface, if, horizontal, text, in, the, typeface, ends, up, looking, top, aligned, with, a, ragged, bottom, edge, the, typeface, can, be, called, ppallaetjul, geulkkol, clothesline, typeface, these, fonts, have, been, used, as, design, accents, on, signs, or, headings, rather, than, for, typesetting, large, volumes, of, body, text, there, was, a, minor, and, unsuccessful, movement, in, the, early, twentieth, century, to, abolish, syllabic, blocks, and, write, the, letters, individually, and, in, a, row, in, the, fashion, of, writing, the, latin, alphabets, instead, of, the, standard, convention, of, moa, sseugi, assembled, writing, for, example, would, be, written, for, hangeul, it, is, called, pureo, sseugi, unassembled, writing, avant, garde, typographer, ahn, sang, soo, created, a, font, for, the, hangul, dada, exposition, that, disassembled, the, syllable, blocks, but, while, it, strings, out, the, letters, horizontally, it, retains, the, distinctive, vertical, position, each, letter, would, normally, have, within, a, block, unlike, the, older, linear, writing, proposals, until, the, 20th, century, no, official, orthography, of, the, korean, alphabet, had, been, established, due, to, liaison, heavy, consonant, assimilation, dialectal, variants, and, other, reasons, a, korean, word, can, potentially, be, spelled, in, multiple, ways, sejong, seemed, to, prefer, morphophonemic, spelling, representing, the, underlying, root, forms, rather, than, a, phonemic, one, representing, the, actual, sounds, however, early, in, its, history, the, korean, alphabet, was, dominated, by, phonemic, spelling, over, the, centuries, the, orthography, became, partially, morphophonemic, first, in, nouns, and, later, in, verbs, the, modern, korean, alphabet, is, as, morphophonemic, as, is, practical, the, difference, between, phonetic, romanization, phonemic, orthography, and, morphophonemic, orthography, can, be, illustrated, with, the, phrase, motaneun, sarami, motaneun, sarami, a, person, who, cannot, do, it, mo, t, a, n, n, sa, la, mi, mot, ha, n, n, sa, lam, i, after, the, gabo, reform, in, 1894, the, joseon, dynasty, and, later, the, korean, empire, started, to, write, all, official, documents, in, the, korean, alphabet, under, the, government, s, management, proper, usage, of, the, korean, alphabet, and, hanja, including, orthography, was, discussed, until, the, korean, empire, was, annexed, by, japan, in, 1910, the, government, general, of, korea, popularised, a, writing, style, that, mixed, hanja, and, the, korean, alphabet, and, was, used, in, the, later, joseon, dynasty, the, government, revised, the, spelling, rules, in, 1912, 1921, and, 1930, to, be, relatively, phonemic, the, hangul, society, founded, by, ju, si, gyeong, announced, a, proposal, for, a, new, strongly, morphophonemic, orthography, in, 1933, which, became, the, prototype, of, the, contemporary, orthographies, in, both, north, and, south, korea, after, korea, was, divided, the, north, and, south, revised, orthographies, separately, the, guiding, text, for, orthography, of, the, korean, alphabet, is, called, hangeul, matchumbeop, whose, last, south, korean, revision, was, published, in, 1988, by, the, ministry, of, education, since, the, late, joseon, dynasty, period, various, hanja, hangul, mixed, systems, were, used, in, these, systems, hanja, were, used, for, lexical, roots, and, the, korean, alphabet, for, grammatical, words, and, inflections, much, as, kanji, and, kana, are, used, in, japanese, hanja, have, been, almost, entirely, phased, out, of, daily, use, in, north, korea, and, in, south, korea, they, are, mostly, restricted, to, parenthetical, glosses, for, proper, names, and, for, disambiguating, homonyms, indo, arabic, numerals, are, mixed, in, with, the, korean, alphabet, e, g, 2007, 3, 22, 22, march, 2007, because, of, syllable, clustering, words, are, shorter, on, the, page, than, their, linear, counterparts, would, be, and, the, boundaries, between, syllables, are, easily, visible, which, may, aid, reading, if, segmenting, words, into, syllables, is, more, natural, for, the, reader, than, dividing, them, into, phonemes, because, the, component, parts, of, the, syllable, are, relatively, simple, phonemic, characters, the, number, of, strokes, per, character, on, average, is, lower, than, in, chinese, characters, unlike, syllabaries, such, as, japanese, kana, or, chinese, logographs, none, of, which, encode, the, constituent, phonemes, within, a, syllable, the, graphic, complexity, of, korean, syllabic, blocks, varies, in, direct, proportion, with, the, phonemic, complexity, of, the, syllable, like, japanese, kana, or, chinese, characters, and, unlike, linear, alphabets, such, as, those, derived, from, latin, korean, orthography, allows, the, reader, to, utilize, both, the, horizontal, and, vertical, visual, fields, since, korean, syllables, are, represented, both, as, collections, of, phonemes, and, as, unique, looking, graphs, they, may, allow, for, both, visual, and, aural, retrieval, of, words, from, the, lexicon, similar, syllabic, blocks, when, written, in, small, size, can, be, hard, to, distinguish, from, and, therefore, sometimes, confused, with, each, other, examples, include, hot, hut, heut, kwil, kwol, hong, heung, and, halt, halp, halm, the, korean, alphabet, may, be, written, either, vertically, or, horizontally, the, traditional, direction, is, from, top, to, bottom, right, to, left, horizontal, writing, is, also, used, in, hunmin, jeongeum, the, korean, alphabet, was, printed, in, sans, serif, angular, lines, of, even, thickness, this, style, is, found, in, books, published, before, about, 1900, and, can, be, found, in, stone, carvings, on, statues, for, example, over, the, centuries, an, ink, brush, style, of, calligraphy, developed, employing, the, same, style, of, lines, and, angles, as, traditional, korean, calligraphy, this, brush, style, is, called, gungche, which, means, palace, style, because, the, style, was, mostly, developed, and, used, by, the, maidservants, gungnyeo, of, the, court, in, joseon, dynasty, modern, styles, that, are, more, suited, for, printed, media, were, developed, in, the, 20th, century, in, 1993, new, names, for, both, myeongjo, and, gothic, styles, were, introduced, when, ministry, of, culture, initiated, an, effort, to, standardize, typographic, terms, and, the, names, batang, meaning, background, and, dotum, meaning, stand, out, replaced, myeongjo, and, gothic, respectively, these, names, are, also, used, in, microsoft, windows, a, sans, serif, style, with, lines, of, equal, width, is, popular, with, pencil, and, pen, writing, and, is, often, the, default, typeface, of, web, browsers, a, minor, advantage, of, this, style, is, that, it, makes, it, easier, to, distinguish, eung, from, ung, even, in, small, or, untidy, print, as, the, jongseong, ieung, of, such, fonts, usually, lacks, a, serif, that, could, be, mistaken, for, the, short, vertical, line, of, the, letter, u
