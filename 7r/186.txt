in, 1848, the, resulting, board, of, trustees, executed, the, will, s, conditions, and, constructed, the, astor, library, in, 1854, in, the, east, village, the, library, created, was, a, free, reference, library, its, books, were, not, permitted, to, circulate, by, 1872, the, astor, library, was, described, in, a, new, york, times, editorial, as, a, major, reference, and, research, resource, but, popular, it, certainly, is, not, and, so, greatly, is, it, lacking, in, the, essentials, of, a, public, library, that, its, stores, might, almost, as, well, be, under, lock, and, key, for, any, access, the, masses, of, the, people, can, get, thereto, an, act, of, the, new, york, state, legislature, incorporated, the, lenox, library, in, 1870, the, library, was, built, on, fifth,

of, new, york, and, presidential, candidate, samuel, j, tilden, believed, that, a, library, with, citywide, reach, was, required, and, upon, his, death, in, 1886, he, bequeathed, the, bulk, of, his, fortune, about, 2, 4, million, equivalent, of, 81, million, in, 2023, to, establish, and, maintain, a, free, library, and, reading, room, in, the, city, of, new, york, this, money, would, sit, untouched, in, a, trust, for, several, years, until, john, bigelow, a, new, york, attorney, and, andrew, haswell, green, both, trustees, of, the, tilden, fortune, came, up, with, an, idea, to, merge, two, of, the, city, s, largest, libraries, both, the, astor, and, lenox, libraries, were, struggling, financially, although, new, york, city, already, had, numerous, libraries, in, the, 19th, century, almost, all, of, them, were, privately, funded, and, many, charged, admission, or, usage, fees, a, notable, exception, was, cooper, union, which, opened, its, free, reading, room, to, the, public, in, 1859, bigelow, the, most, prominent, supporter, of, the, plan, to, merge, the, two, libraries, found, support, in, lewis, cass, ledyard, a, member, of, the, tilden, board, as, well, as, john, cadwalader, on, the, astor, board, eventually, john, stewart, kennedy, president, of, the, lenox, board, also, came, to, support, the, plan, on, may, 23, 1895, bigelow, cadwalader, and, george, l, rives, agreed, to, create, the, new, york, public, library, astor, lenox, and, tilden, foundations, the, plan, was, hailed, as, an, example, of, private, philanthropy, for, the, public, good, on,

with, the, requirement, that, they, be, operated, and, maintained, by, the, city, of, new, york, the, brooklyn, and, queens, public, library, systems, which, predated, the, consolidation, of, new, york, city, eschewed, the, grants, offered, to, them, and, did, not, join, the, nypl, system, they, believed, that, they, would, not, get, treatment, equal, to, the, manhattan, and, the, bronx, counterparts, later, in, 1901, carnegie, formally, signed, a, contract, with, the, city, of, new, york, to, transfer, his, donation, to, the, city, in, order, to, enable, it, to, justify, purchasing, the, land, for, building, the, branch, libraries, the, nypl, board, of, trustees, hired, consultants, for, the, planning, and, accepted, their, recommendation, that, a, limited, number, of, architectural, firms, be, hired, to, build, the, carnegie, libraries, this, would, ensure, uniformity, of, appearance, and, minimize, cost, the, trustees, hired, mckim, mead, white, carr, re, and,
