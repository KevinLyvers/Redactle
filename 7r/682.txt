identifying, the, communist, party, as, the, most, advanced, and, resolute, section, of, the, working, class, parties, of, every, country, that, section, which, pushes, forward, all, others, as, the, vanguard, party, the, bolsheviks, viewed, history, through, the, theoretical, framework, of, dialectical, materialism, which, sanctioned, political, commitment, to, the, successful, overthrow, of, capitalism, and, then, to, instituting, socialism, and, as, the, revolutionary, national, government, to, realise, the, socio, economic, transition, by, all, means, in, the, aftermath, of, the, october, revolution, in, 1917, leninism, was, the, dominant, version, of, marxism, in, russia, in, establishing, the, socialist, mode, of, production, in, soviet, russia, with, the, 1917, decree, on, land, war, communism, 1918, 1921, and, the, new, economic, policy, 1921, 1928, the, revolutionary, r, gime, suppressed, most, political, opposition, including, marxists, who, opposed, lenin, s, actions, the, anarchists, and, the, mensheviks, factions, of, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, and, the, left, socialist, revolutionaries, the, russian, civil, war, 1917, 1922, which, included, the, fight, against, the, white, army, entente, intervention, left, wing, uprisings, against, the, bolsheviks, and, widespread, peasant, rebellions, was, an, external, and, internal, war, which, transformed, bolshevik, russia, into, the, russian, socialist, federative, soviet, republic, rsfsr, the, core, and, largest, republic, that, founded, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, ussr, as, revolutionary, praxis, leninism, originally, was, neither, a, proper, philosophy, nor, a, discrete, political, theory, leninism, comprises, politico, economic, developments, of, orthodox, marxism, and, lenin, s, interpretations, of, marxism, which, function, as, a, pragmatic, synthesis, for, practical, application, to, the, actual, conditions, political, social, economic, of, the, post, emancipation, agrarian, society, of, imperial, russia, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, a, political, science, term, lenin, s, theory, of, proletarian, revolution, entered, common, usage, at, the, fifth, congress, of, the, communist, international, 1924, when, grigory, zinoviev, applied, the, term, leninism, to, denote, vanguard, party, revolution, leninism, was, accepted, as, part, of, russian, communist, party, b, s, vocabulary, and, doctrine, around, 1922, and, in, january, 1923, despite, objections, from, lenin, it, entered, the, public, vocabulary, in, the, 19th, century, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, wrote, the, manifesto, of, the, communist, party, 1848, in, which, they, called, for, the, political, unification, of, the, european, working, classes, in, order, to, achieve, communist, revolution, and, proposed, that, because, the, socio, economic, organisation, of, communism, was, of, a, higher, form, than, that, of, capitalism, a, workers, revolution, first, would, occur, in, the, industrialised, countries, in, germany, marxist, social, democracy, was, the, political, perspective, of, the, social, democratic, party, of, germany, inspiring, russian, marxists, such, as, lenin, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, socio, economic, backwardness, of, imperial, russia, 1721, 1917, characterized, by, combined, and, uneven, economic, development, facilitated, rapid, and, intensive, industrialisation, which, produced, a, united, working, class, proletariat, in, a, predominantly, agrarian, society, moreover, because, industrialisation, was, financed, chiefly, with, foreign, capital, imperial, russia, did, not, possess, a, revolutionary, bourgeoisie, with, political, and, economic, influence, upon, the, workers, and, the, peasants, as, had, been, the, case, in, the, french, revolution, 1789, 1799, in, the, 18th, century, although, russia, s, political, economy, was, agrarian, and, semi, feudal, the, task, of, democratic, revolution, fell, to, the, urban, industrial, working, class, as, the, only, social, class, capable, of, effecting, land, reform, and, democratisation, in, view, that, the, russian, bourgeoisie, would, suppress, any, revolution, in, the, april, theses, 1917, the, political, strategy, of, the, october, revolution, 7, 8, november, 1917, lenin, proposed, that, the, russian, revolution, was, not, an, isolated, national, event, but, a, fundamentally, international, event, the, first, socialist, revolution, in, the, world, lenin, s, practical, application, of, marxism, and, proletarian, revolution, to, the, social, political, and, economic, conditions, of, agrarian, russia, motivated, and, impelled, the, revolutionary, nationalism, of, the, poor, to, depose, the, absolute, monarchy, of, the, three, hundred, year, dynasty, of, the, house, of, romanov, 1613, 1917, as, tsars, of, russia, in, imperialism, the, highest, stage, of, capitalism, 1916, lenin, s, economic, analyses, indicated, that, capitalism, would, transform, into, a, global, financial, system, by, which, industrialised, countries, exported, financial, capital, to, their, colonies, and, so, realise, the, exploitation, of, the, labour, of, the, natives, and, the, exploitation, of, the, natural, resources, of, their, countries, such, superexploitation, allows, wealthy, countries, to, maintain, a, domestic, labour, aristocracy, with, a, slightly, higher, standard, of, living, than, most, workers, ensuring, peaceful, labour, capital, relations, in, the, capitalist, homeland, therefore, a, proletarian, revolution, of, workers, and, peasants, could, not, occur, in, capitalist, countries, whilst, the, imperialist, global, finance, system, remained, in, place, the, first, proletarian, revolution, would, have, to, occur, in, an, underdeveloped, country, such, as, imperial, russia, the, politically, weakest, country, in, the, capitalist, global, finance, system, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, united, states, of, europe, slogan, 1915, lenin, wrote, workers, of, the, world, unite, uneven, economic, and, political, development, is, an, absolute, law, of, capitalism, hence, the, victory, of, socialism, is, possible, first, in, several, or, even, in, one, capitalist, country, taken, separately, the, victorious, proletariat, of, that, country, having, expropriated, the, capitalists, and, organised, its, own, socialist, production, would, stand, up, against, the, rest, of, the, world, the, capitalist, world, in, left, wing, communism, an, infantile, disorder, 1920, lenin, wrote, the, more, powerful, enemy, can, be, vanquished, only, by, exerting, the, utmost, effort, and, by, the, most, thorough, careful, attentive, skillful, and, obligatory, use, of, any, even, the, smallest, rift, between, the, enemies, any, conflict, of, interests, among, the, bourgeoisie, of, the, various, countries, and, among, the, various, groups, or, types, of, bourgeoisie, within, the, various, countries, and, also, by, taking, advantage, of, any, even, the, smallest, opportunity, of, winning, a, mass, ally, even, though, this, ally, is, temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable, and, conditional, those, who, do, not, understand, this, reveal, a, failure, to, understand, even, the, smallest, grain, of, marxism, of, modern, scientific, socialism, in, general, those, who, have, not, proved, in, practice, over, a, fairly, considerable, period, of, time, and, in, fairly, varied, political, situations, their, ability, to, apply, this, truth, in, practice, have, not, yet, learned, to, help, the, revolutionary, class, in, its, struggle, to, emancipate, all, toiling, humanity, from, the, exploiters, and, this, applies, equally, to, the, period, before, and, after, the, proletariat, has, won, political, power, in, chapter, ii, proletarians, and, communists, of, the, communist, manifesto, 1848, marx, and, engels, present, the, communist, party, as, the, political, vanguard, solely, qualified, to, lead, the, proletariat, in, revolution, the, communists, therefore, are, on, the, one, hand, practically, the, most, advanced, and, resolute, section, of, the, working, class, parties, of, every, country, that, section, which, pushes, forward, all, others, on, the, other, hand, theoretically, they, have, over, the, great, mass, of, the, proletariat, the, advantage, of, clearly, understanding, the, lines, of, march, the, conditions, and, the, ultimate, general, results, of, the, proletarian, movement, the, immediate, aim, of, the, communists, is, the, same, as, that, of, all, other, proletarian, parties, formation, of, the, proletariat, into, a, class, overthrow, of, the, bourgeois, supremacy, conquest, of, political, power, by, the, proletariat, the, revolutionary, purpose, of, the, leninist, vanguard, party, is, to, establish, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, with, the, working, class, s, support, the, communist, party, would, lead, the, popular, deposition, of, the, tsarist, government, and, then, transfer, government, power, to, the, working, class, that, change, of, the, ruling, class, from, the, bourgeoisie, to, the, proletariat, makes, establishing, socialism, possible, in, what, is, to, be, done, 1902, lenin, said, that, a, revolutionary, vanguard, party, recruited, from, the, working, class, should, lead, the, political, campaign, because, only, in, that, way, would, the, proletariat, successfully, realise, their, revolution, unlike, the, economic, campaign, of, trade, union, struggle, advocated, by, other, socialist, political, parties, and, the, anarcho, syndicalists, like, marx, lenin, distinguished, between, the, aspects, of, a, revolution, the, economic, campaign, labour, strikes, for, increased, wages, and, work, concessions, that, featured, diffused, plural, leadership, and, the, political, campaign, socialist, changes, to, society, which, required, the, decisive, revolutionary, leadership, of, the, bolshevik, vanguard, party, based, upon, the, first, international, iwa, international, workingmen, s, association, 1864, 1876, lenin, organised, the, bolsheviks, as, a, democratically, centralised, vanguard, party, wherein, free, political, speech, was, recognised, as, legitimate, until, policy, consensus, afterwards, every, member, of, the, party, was, expected, to, abide, by, the, agreed, policy, democratic, debate, was, bolshevik, practice, even, after, lenin, banned, factions, among, the, party, in, 1921, despite, being, a, guiding, political, influence, lenin, did, not, exercise, absolute, power, and, continually, debated, to, have, his, points, of, view, accepted, as, a, course, of, revolutionary, action, in, freedom, to, criticise, and, unity, of, action, 1905, lenin, said, of, course, the, application, of, this, principle, in, practice, will, sometimes, give, rise, to, disputes, and, misunderstandings, but, only, on, the, basis, of, this, principle, can, all, disputes, and, all, misunderstandings, be, settled, honourably, for, the, party, the, principle, of, democratic, centralism, and, autonomy, for, local, party, organisations, implies, universal, and, full, freedom, to, criticise, so, long, as, this, does, not, disturb, the, unity, of, a, definite, action, it, rules, out, all, criticism, which, disrupts, or, makes, difficult, the, unity, of, an, action, decided, on, by, the, party, before, the, october, revolution, despite, supporting, moderate, political, reform, including, bolsheviks, elected, to, the, duma, when, opportune, lenin, said, that, capitalism, could, only, be, overthrown, with, proletarian, revolution, not, with, gradual, reforms, from, within, fabianism, and, from, without, social, democracy, which, would, fail, because, the, bourgeoisie, s, control, of, the, means, of, production, determined, the, nature, of, political, power, in, russia, as, epitomised, in, the, slogan, for, a, democratic, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, and, peasantry, a, proletarian, revolution, in, underdeveloped, russia, required, a, united, proletariat, peasants, and, industrial, workers, to, assume, government, power, in, the, cities, successfully, moreover, owing, to, the, middle, class, aspirations, of, much, of, the, peasantry, leon, trotsky, said, that, the, proletarian, leadership, of, the, revolution, would, ensure, truly, socialist, and, democratic, socio, economic, change, in, bolshevik, russia, government, by, direct, democracy, was, realised, and, effected, by, the, soviets, elected, councils, of, workers, which, lenin, said, was, the, democratic, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, postulated, in, orthodox, marxism, the, soviets, comprised, representative, committees, from, the, factories, and, the, trade, unions, but, excluded, the, capitalist, social, class, to, establish, a, proletarian, government, by, and, for, the, working, class, and, the, peasants, concerning, the, political, disenfranchisement, of, the, capitalist, social, class, in, bolshevik, russia, lenin, said, that, depriving, the, exploiters, of, the, franchise, is, a, purely, russian, question, and, not, a, question, of, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, in, general, in, which, countries, democracy, for, the, exploiters, will, be, in, one, or, another, form, restricted, is, a, question, of, the, specific, national, features, of, this, or, that, capitalism, in, chapter, five, of, the, state, and, revolution, 1917, lenin, describes, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, as, the, organisation, of, the, vanguard, of, the, oppressed, as, the, ruling, class, for, the, purpose, of, crushing, the, oppressors, an, immense, expansion, of, democracy, which, for, the, first, time, becomes, democracy, for, the, poor, democracy, for, the, people, and, not, democracy, for, the, rich, and, suppression, by, force, i, e, exclusion, from, democracy, for, the, exploiters, and, oppressors, of, the, people, this, is, the, change, which, democracy, undergoes, during, the, transition, from, capitalism, to, communism, concerning, the, disenfranchisement, from, democracy, of, the, capitalist, social, class, lenin, said, democracy, for, the, vast, majority, of, the, people, and, suppression, by, force, i, e, exclusion, from, democracy, of, the, exploiters, and, oppressors, of, the, people, this, is, the, change, democracy, undergoes, during, the, transition, from, capitalism, to, communism, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, was, effected, with, soviet, constitutionalism, a, form, of, government, opposite, to, the, dictatorship, of, capital, privately, owned, means, of, production, practised, in, bourgeois, democracies, under, soviet, constitutionalism, the, leninist, vanguard, party, would, be, one, of, many, political, parties, competing, for, election, to, government, power, nevertheless, because, of, the, russian, civil, war, 1917, 1924, and, the, anti, bolshevik, terrorism, of, opposing, political, parties, aiding, the, white, armies, counter, revolution, the, bolshevik, government, banned, all, other, political, parties, which, left, the, leninist, vanguard, party, as, the, only, political, party, in, russia, lenin, said, that, such, political, suppression, was, not, philosophically, inherent, to, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, the, bolshevik, government, nationalised, industry, and, established, a, foreign, trade, monopoly, to, allow, the, productive, coordination, of, the, national, economy, and, so, prevent, russian, national, industries, from, competing, against, each, other, to, feed, the, populaces, of, town, and, country, lenin, instituted, war, communism, 1918, 1921, as, a, necessary, condition, adequate, supplies, of, food, and, weapons, for, fighting, the, russian, civil, war, in, march, 1921, the, new, economic, policy, nep, 1921, 1929, allowed, limited, local, capitalism, private, commerce, and, internal, free, trade, and, replaced, grain, requisitions, with, an, agricultural, tax, managed, by, state, banks, the, nep, was, meant, to, resolve, food, shortage, riots, by, the, peasantry, and, allowed, limited, private, enterprise, the, profit, motive, encouraged, farmers, to, produce, the, crops, required, to, feed, town, and, country, and, to, economically, re, establish, the, urban, working, class, who, had, lost, many, workers, to, fight, the, counter, revolutionary, civil, war, the, nep, nationalisation, of, the, economy, then, would, facilitate, the, industrialisation, of, russia, politically, strengthen, the, working, class, and, raise, the, standards, of, living, for, all, russians, lenin, said, that, the, appearance, of, new, socialist, states, was, necessary, for, strengthening, russia, s, economy, in, establishing, russian, socialism, lenin, s, socio, economic, perspective, was, supported, by, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, the, italian, insurrection, and, general, strikes, of, 1920, and, worker, wage, riots, in, the, uk, france, and, the, us, in, recognising, and, accepting, nationalism, among, oppressed, peoples, lenin, advocated, their, national, right, to, self, determination, and, so, opposed, russian, chauvinism, because, such, ethnocentrism, was, a, cultural, obstacle, to, establishing, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, in, every, territory, of, the, deposed, russian, empire, 1721, 1917, in, the, right, of, nations, to, self, determination, 1914, lenin, said, we, fight, against, the, privileges, and, violence, of, the, oppressor, nation, and, do, not, in, any, way, condone, strivings, for, privileges, on, the, part, of, the, oppressed, nation, the, bourgeois, nationalism, of, any, oppressed, nation, has, a, general, democratic, content, that, is, directed, against, oppression, and, it, is, this, content, that, we, unconditionally, support, at, the, same, time, we, strictly, distinguish, it, from, the, tendency, towards, national, exclusiveness, can, a, nation, be, free, if, it, oppresses, other, nations, it, cannot, the, socialist, internationalism, of, marxism, and, bolshevism, is, based, upon, class, struggle, and, a, people, s, transcending, nationalism, ethnocentrism, and, religion, the, intellectual, obstacles, to, progressive, class, consciousness, which, are, the, cultural, status, quo, that, the, capitalist, ruling, class, manipulates, in, order, to, divide, the, working, classes, and, the, peasant, classes, politically, to, overcome, that, barrier, to, establishing, socialism, lenin, said, that, acknowledging, nationalism, as, a, people, s, right, of, self, determination, and, right, of, secession, naturally, would, allow, socialist, states, to, transcend, the, political, limitations, of, nationalism, to, form, a, federation, in, the, question, of, nationalities, or, autonomisation, 1923, lenin, said, othing, holds, up, the, development, and, strengthening, of, proletarian, class, solidarity, so, much, as, national, injustice, offended, nationals, are, not, sensitive, to, anything, so, much, as, to, the, feeling, of, equality, and, the, violation, of, this, equality, if, only, through, negligence, or, jest, to, the, violation, of, that, equality, by, their, proletarian, comrades, the, role, of, the, leninist, vanguard, party, was, to, politically, educate, the, workers, and, peasants, to, dispel, the, societal, false, consciousness, of, religion, and, nationalism, that, constitute, the, cultural, status, quo, taught, by, the, bourgeoisie, to, the, proletariat, to, facilitate, their, economic, exploitation, of, peasants, and, workers, influenced, by, lenin, the, central, committee, of, the, bolshevik, party, stated, that, the, development, of, the, socialist, workers, culture, should, not, be, hamstrung, from, above, and, opposed, the, proletkult, 1917, 1925, organisational, control, of, the, national, culture, in, post, revolutionary, russia, the, stalinist, application, of, marxism, leninism, socialism, in, one, country, and, trotskyism, permanent, world, revolution, were, the, principal, philosophies, of, communism, that, claimed, legitimate, ideological, descent, from, leninism, thus, within, the, communist, party, each, ideological, faction, denied, the, political, legitimacy, of, the, opposing, faction, until, shortly, before, his, death, lenin, countered, stalin, s, disproportionate, political, influence, in, the, communist, party, and, the, bureaucracy, of, the, soviet, government, partly, because, of, abuses, he, had, committed, against, the, populace, of, georgia, and, partly, because, the, autocratic, stalin, had, accumulated, administrative, power, disproportionate, to, his, office, of, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, the, counter, action, against, stalin, aligned, with, lenin, s, advocacy, of, the, right, of, self, determination, for, the, national, and, ethnic, groups, of, the, deposed, tsarist, empire, lenin, warned, the, party, that, stalin, had, unlimited, authority, concentrated, in, his, hands, and, i, am, not, sure, whether, he, will, always, be, capable, of, using, that, authority, with, sufficient, caution, and, formed, a, faction, with, leon, trotsky, to, remove, stalin, as, the, general, secretary, of, the, communist, party, to, that, end, followed, proposals, reducing, the, administrative, powers, of, party, posts, to, reduce, bureaucratic, influence, upon, the, policies, of, the, communist, party, lenin, advised, trotsky, to, emphasise, stalin, s, recent, bureaucratic, alignment, in, such, matters, e, g, undermining, the, anti, bureaucratic, workers, and, peasants, inspection, and, argued, to, depose, stalin, as, general, secretary, despite, advice, to, refuse, any, rotten, compromise, he, did, not, heed, lenin, s, advice, and, general, secretary, stalin, retained, power, over, the, communist, party, and, the, bureaucracy, of, the, soviet, government, in, 1922, lenin, allied, with, leon, trotsky, against, the, party, s, growing, bureaucratisation, and, the, influence, of, joseph, stalin, lenin, himself, never, mentioned, the, concept, of, trotskyism, after, trotsky, became, a, member, of, the, bolshevik, party, but, the, term, was, employed, by, stalin, and, the, troika, to, present, trotsky, s, views, as, factional, and, anathematical, to, leninist, thought, after, lenin, s, death, 21, january, 1924, trotsky, ideologically, battled, the, influence, of, stalin, who, formed, ruling, blocs, within, the, russian, communist, party, with, grigory, zinoviev, and, lev, kamenev, then, with, nikolai, bukharin, and, then, by, himself, and, so, determined, soviet, government, policy, from, 1924, onwards, the, ruling, blocs, continually, denied, stalin, s, opponents, the, right, to, organise, as, an, opposition, faction, within, the, party, thus, the, reinstatement, of, democratic, centralism, and, free, speech, within, the, communist, party, were, key, arguments, of, trotsky, s, left, opposition, and, the, later, joint, opposition, in, instituting, government, policy, stalin, promoted, the, doctrine, of, socialism, in, one, country, adopted, 1925, wherein, the, soviet, union, would, establish, socialism, upon, russia, s, economic, foundations, and, support, socialist, revolutions, elsewhere, in, a, 1936, interview, with, journalist, roy, w, howard, stalin, articulated, his, rejection, of, world, revolution, and, stated, that, we, never, had, such, plans, and, intentions, and, that, the, export, of, revolution, is, nonsense, conversely, trotsky, held, that, socialism, in, one, country, would, economically, constrain, the, industrial, development, of, the, soviet, union, and, thus, required, assistance, from, the, new, socialist, countries, in, the, developed, world, which, was, essential, for, maintaining, soviet, democracy, in, 1924, much, undermined, by, the, russian, civil, war, of, white, army, counter, revolution, trotsky, s, theory, of, permanent, revolution, proposed, that, socialist, revolutions, in, underdeveloped, countries, would, further, dismantle, feudal, r, gimes, and, establish, socialist, democracies, that, would, not, pass, through, a, capitalist, stage, of, development, and, government, hence, revolutionary, workers, should, ally, politically, with, peasant, political, organisations, not, capitalist, political, parties, in, contrast, stalin, and, his, allies, proposed, that, alliances, with, capitalist, political, parties, were, essential, to, realising, a, revolution, where, communists, were, too, few, said, stalinist, practice, failed, especially, in, the, northern, expedition, portion, of, the, chinese, revolution, 1926, 1928, which, resulted, in, the, right, wing, kuomintang, s, massacre, of, the, chinese, communist, party, despite, the, failure, stalin, s, policy, of, mixed, ideology, political, alliances, nonetheless, became, comintern, s, policy, until, exiled, from, russia, in, 1929, trotsky, developed, and, led, the, left, opposition, and, the, later, joint, opposition, with, members, of, the, workers, opposition, the, decembrists, and, later, the, zinovievists, trotskyism, predominated, the, politics, of, the, left, opposition, which, demanded, the, restoration, of, soviet, democracy, the, expansion, of, democratic, centralism, in, the, communist, party, national, industrialisation, international, permanent, revolution, and, socialist, internationalism, according, to, historian, sheila, fitzpatrick, the, scholarly, consensus, was, that, stalin, appropriated, the, position, of, the, left, opposition, on, such, matters, as, industrialisation, and, collectivisation, the, trotskyist, demands, countered, stalin, s, political, dominance, of, the, communist, party, which, was, officially, characterised, by, the, cult, of, lenin, the, rejection, of, permanent, revolution, and, advocated, the, doctrine, of, socialism, in, one, country, the, stalinist, economic, policy, vacillated, between, appeasing, the, capitalist, interests, of, the, kulak, in, the, countryside, and, destroying, them, as, a, social, class, initially, the, stalinists, also, rejected, the, national, industrialisation, of, russia, but, then, pursued, it, in, full, sometimes, brutally, in, both, cases, the, left, opposition, denounced, the, regressive, nature, of, stalin, s, policy, towards, the, wealthy, kulak, social, class, and, the, brutality, of, forced, industrialisation, trotsky, described, stalinist, vacillation, as, a, symptom, of, the, undemocratic, nature, of, a, ruling, bureaucracy, during, the, 1920s, and, the, 1930s, stalin, fought, and, defeated, the, political, influence, of, trotsky, and, the, trotskyists, in, russia, using, slander, antisemitism, censorship, expulsions, exile, internal, and, external, and, imprisonment, the, anti, trotsky, campaign, culminated, in, the, executions, official, and, unofficial, of, the, moscow, trials, 1936, 1938, which, were, part, of, the, great, purge, of, old, bolsheviks, who, had, led, the, revolution, some, historians, such, as, richard, pipes, consider, stalinism, as, the, natural, consequence, of, leninism, that, stalin, faithfully, implemented, lenin, s, domestic, and, foreign, policy, programs, robert, service, notes, that, institutionally, and, ideologically, lenin, laid, the, foundations, for, a, stalin, but, the, passage, from, leninism, to, the, worse, terrors, of, stalinism, was, not, smooth, and, inevitable, historian, and, stalin, biographer, edvard, radzinsky, believes, that, stalin, was, a, genuine, follower, of, lenin, exactly, as, he, claimed, himself, proponents, of, continuity, cite, a, variety, of, contributory, factors, in, that, it, was, lenin, rather, than, stalin, whose, civil, war, measures, introduced, the, red, terror, with, its, hostage, taking, and, internment, camps, that, it, was, lenin, who, developed, the, infamous, article, 58, and, who, established, the, autocratic, system, within, the, russian, communist, party, proponents, also, note, that, lenin, put, a, ban, on, factions, within, the, party, and, introduced, the, one, party, state, in, 1921, a, move, that, enabled, stalin, to, get, rid, of, his, rivals, easily, after, lenin, s, death, and, cite, felix, dzerzhinsky, who, exclaimed, during, the, bolshevik, struggle, against, opponents, in, the, russian, civil, war, we, stand, for, organized, terror, this, should, be, frankly, stated, some, scholars, have, had, a, differing, view, and, attributed, the, establishment, of, the, one, party, system, in, the, soviet, union, to, the, wartime, conditions, imposed, on, lenin, s, government, and, others, have, highlighted, the, initial, attempts, to, form, a, coalition, government, with, the, left, socialist, revolutionaries, according, to, historian, marcel, liebman, lenin, s, wartime, measures, such, as, banning, opposition, parties, was, prompted, by, the, fact, that, several, political, parties, either, took, up, arms, against, the, new, soviet, government, or, participated, in, sabotage, collaborated, with, the, deposed, tsarists, or, made, assassination, attempts, against, lenin, and, other, bolshevik, leaders, liebman, also, argued, that, the, banning, of, parties, under, lenin, did, not, have, the, same, repressive, character, as, later, bans, enforced, under, the, stalinist, regime, several, scholars, have, highlighted, the, socially, progressive, nature, of, lenin, s, policies, such, as, universal, education, universal, healthcare, and, equal, rights, for, women, conversely, stalin, s, regime, reversed, lenin, s, policies, on, social, matters, such, as, sexual, equality, legal, restrictions, on, marriage, rights, of, sexual, minorities, and, protective, legislation, historian, robert, vincent, daniels, also, viewed, the, stalinist, period, as, a, counter, revolution, in, soviet, cultural, life, which, revived, patriotic, propaganda, the, tsarist, programme, of, russification, and, traditional, military, ranks, which, had, been, criticized, by, lenin, as, expressions, of, great, russian, chauvinism, daniels, also, regarded, stalinism, to, represent, an, abrupt, break, with, the, leninist, period, in, terms, of, economic, policies, in, which, a, deliberated, scientific, system, of, economic, planning, that, featured, former, menshevik, economists, at, gosplan, had, been, replaced, with, a, hasty, version, of, planning, with, unrealistic, targets, bureaucratic, waste, bottlenecks, and, shortages, revisionist, historians, and, some, post, cold, war, and, otherwise, dissident, soviet, historians, including, roy, medvedev, argue, that, one, could, list, the, various, measures, carried, out, by, stalin, that, were, actually, a, continuation, of, anti, democratic, trends, and, measures, implemented, under, lenin, but, that, in, so, many, ways, stalin, acted, not, in, line, with, lenin, s, clear, instructions, but, in, defiance, of, them, in, doing, so, some, historians, have, tried, to, distance, stalinism, from, leninism, to, undermine, the, totalitarian, view, that, the, negative, facets, of, stalin, were, inherent, in, communism, from, the, start, critics, include, anti, stalinist, communists, such, as, leon, trotsky, who, pointed, out, that, lenin, attempted, to, persuade, the, russian, communist, party, to, remove, stalin, from, his, post, as, its, general, secretary, lenin, s, testament, the, document, which, contained, this, order, was, suppressed, after, lenin, s, death, trotsky, also, argued, that, he, and, lenin, had, intended, to, lift, the, ban, on, the, opposition, parties, such, as, the, mensheviks, and, socialist, revolutionaries, as, soon, as, the, economic, and, social, conditions, of, soviet, russia, had, improved, various, historians, have, cited, lenin, s, proposal, to, appoint, trotsky, as, a, vice, chairman, of, the, soviet, union, as, evidence, that, he, intended, trotsky, to, be, his, successor, as, head, of, government, in, his, biography, of, trotsky, polish, british, historian, isaac, deutscher, says, that, on, being, faced, with, the, evidence, only, the, blind, and, the, deaf, could, be, unaware, of, the, contrast, between, stalinism, and, leninism, according, to, stalin, s, secretary, boris, bazhanov, stalin, was, jubilant, over, lenin, s, death, while, publicly, putting, on, the, mask, of, grief, french, historian, pierre, broue, disputed, the, historical, assessments, of, the, early, soviet, union, by, modern, historians, such, as, dmitri, volkogonov, in, which, he, argued, had, falsely, equated, leninism, stalinism, and, trotskyism, to, present, the, notion, of, ideological, continuity, and, reinforce, the, position, of, counter, communism, other, revisionist, historians, such, as, orlando, figes, whilst, critical, of, the, soviet, era, acknowledge, that, lenin, had, actively, sought, to, counter, the, growing, influence, of, stalin, through, a, number, of, actions, such, as, his, alliance, with, trotsky, in, 1922, 23, opposition, to, stalin, on, foreign, trade, the, georgian, affair, and, proposed, party, reforms, which, included, the, democratisation, of, the, central, committee, and, recruitment, of, 50, 100, ordinary, workers, into, the, lower, organs, of, the, party, nikita, khrushchev, stalin, s, successor, argued, that, stalin, s, regime, differed, profusely, from, the, leadership, of, lenin, in, his, secret, speech, delivered, in, 1956, he, was, critical, of, the, cult, of, the, individual, which, was, constructed, around, stalin, whereas, lenin, stressed, the, role, of, the, people, as, the, creator, of, history, he, also, emphasized, that, lenin, favored, a, collective, leadership, which, relied, on, personal, persuasion, and, recommended, the, removal, of, stalin, from, the, position, of, general, secretary, khrushchev, contrasted, this, with, the, despotism, of, stalin, which, require, absolute, submission, to, his, position, and, he, also, highlighted, that, many, of, the, people, who, were, later, annihilated, as, enemies, of, the, party, had, worked, with, lenin, during, his, life, he, also, contrasted, the, severe, methods, used, by, lenin, in, the, most, necessary, cases, as, a, struggle, for, survival, during, the, civil, war, with, the, extreme, methods, and, mass, repressions, used, by, stalin, even, when, the, revolution, was, already, victorious, in, his, memoirs, khrushchev, argued, that, stalin, s, widespread, purges, of, the, most, advanced, nucleus, of, people, among, the, old, bolsheviks, and, leading, figures, in, the, military, and, scientific, fields, had, undoubtedly, weakened, the, nation, some, marxist, theoreticians, have, disputed, the, view, that, the, stalinist, dictatorship, was, a, natural, outgrowth, of, the, bolsheviks, actions, as, most, of, the, original, central, committee, members, from, 1917, were, later, eliminated, by, stalin, george, novack, stressed, the, initial, efforts, by, the, bolsheviks, to, form, a, government, with, the, left, socialist, revolutionaries, and, bring, other, parties, such, as, the, mensheviks, into, political, legality, tony, cliff, argued, the, bolshevik, left, socialist, revolutionary, coalition, government, dissolved, the, democratically, elected, russian, constituent, assembly, due, to, a, number, of, reasons, they, cited, the, outdated, voter, rolls, which, did, not, acknowledge, the, split, among, the, socialist, revolutionary, party, and, the, assemblies, conflict, with, the, russian, congress, of, the, soviets, as, an, alternative, democratic, structure, a, similar, analysis, is, present, in, more, recent, works, such, as, those, of, graeme, gill, who, argues, that, not, a, natural, flow, on, of, earlier, developments, sharp, break, resulting, from, conscious, decisions, by, leading, political, actors, however, gill, notes, that, difficulties, with, the, use, of, the, term, reflect, problems, with, the, concept, of, stalinism, itself, the, major, difficulty, is, a, lack, of, agreement, about, what, should, constitute, stalinism, revisionist, historians, such, as, sheila, fitzpatrick, have, criticized, the, focus, on, the, upper, levels, of, society, and, the, use, of, cold, war, concepts, such, as, totalitarianism, obscuring, the, system, s, reality, russian, historian, vadim, rogovin, stated, that, under, lenin, the, freedom, to, express, a, real, variety, of, opinions, existed, in, the, party, and, in, carrying, out, political, decisions, consideration, was, given, to, the, positions, of, not, only, the, majority, but, a, minority, in, the, party, he, compared, this, practice, with, subsequent, leadership, blocs, which, violated, party, tradition, ignored, proposals, of, opponents, and, expelled, the, opposition, from, the, party, on, falsified, charges, which, culminated, with, the, moscow, trials, of, 1936, 1938, according, to, rogovin, 80, 90, of, the, members, of, the, central, committee, elected, at, the, sixth, through, to, the, seventeenth, congresses, were, physically, annihilated, the, right, opposition, and, left, opposition, have, been, held, by, some, scholars, as, representing, political, alternatives, to, stalinism, despite, their, shared, beliefs, in, leninism, due, to, their, policy, platforms, which, were, at, variance, with, stalin, this, ranged, from, areas, related, to, economics, foreign, policy, and, cultural, matters, as, a, form, of, marxism, revolutionary, leninism, was, criticised, as, an, undemocratic, interpretation, of,

geopolitical, mistakes, of, the, bolsheviks, would, create, significant, dangers, for, the, russian, revolution, such, as, the, bureaucratisation, that, would, arise, to, administrate, the, large,
