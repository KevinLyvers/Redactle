silver, penny, used, in, norman, england, in, the, twelfth, century, which, bore, a, small, star, another, theory, holds, that, the, hanseatic, league, was, the, origin, of, its, definition,

system, in, england, c, 800, here, is, a, summary, of, changes, to, its, value, in, terms, of, silver, or, gold, until, 1816, the, pound, was, a, unit, of, account, in, anglo, saxon, england, by, the, ninth, century, it, was, equal, to, 240, silver, pence, the, accounting, system, of, dividing, one, pound, into, twenty, shillings, a, shilling, into, twelve, pence, and, a, penny, into, four, farthings, was, adopted, from, the, livre, carolingienne, system, introduced, by, charlemagne, to, the, frankish, empire, the, penny, was, abbreviated, to, d, from, denarius, the, roman, equivalent, of, the, penny, the, shilling, to, s, from, solidus, written, with, a, long, s, later, evolving, into, a, simple, slash, and, the, pound, to, l, subsequently, from, libra, or, livre, the, origins, of, sterling, lie, in, the, reign, of, king, offa, of, mercia, 757, 796, who, introduced, a, sterling, coin, made, by, physically, dividing, a, tower, pound, 5, 400, grains, 349, 9, grams, of, silver, into, 240, parts, in, practice, the, weights, of, the, coins, were, not, consistent, 240, of, them, seldom, added, up, to, a, full, pound, there, were, no, shilling, or, pound, coins, and, these, units, were, used, only, as, an, accounting, convenience, halfpennies, and, farthings, worth, 1, 2, and, 1, 4, penny, respectively, were, also, minted, but, small, change, was, more, commonly, produced, by, cutting, up, a, whole, penny, the, early, pennies, were, struck, from, fine, silver, as, pure, as, was, available, in, 1158, a, new, coinage, was, introduced, by, king, henry, ii, known, as, the, tealby, penny, with, a, tower, pound, 5, 400, grains, 349, 9, g, of, 92, 5, silver, minted, into, 240, pennies, each, penny, containing, 20, 82, grains, 1, 349, g, of, fine, silver, called, sterling, silver, the, alloy, is, harder, than, the, 99, 9, fine, silver, that, was, traditionally, used, and, sterling, silver, coins, did, not, wear, down, as, rapidly, as, fine, silver, ones, the, introduction, of, the, larger, french, gros, tournois, coins, in, 1266, and, their, subsequent, popularity, led, to, additional, denominations, in, the, form, of, groats, worth, four, pence, and, half, groats, worth, two, pence, a, gold, penny, weighing, twice, the, silver, penny, and, valued, at, 20, silver, pence, was, also, issued, in, 1257, but, was, not, successful, the, english, penny, remained, nearly, unchanged, from, 800, and, was, a, prominent, exception, in, the, progressive, debasements, of, coinage, which, occurred, in, the, rest, of, europe, the, tower, pound, originally, divided, into, 240, pence, devalued, to, 243, pence, by, 1279, during, the, reign, of, king, edward, iii, the, introduction, of, gold, coins, received, from, flanders, as, payment, for, english, wool, provided, substantial, economic, and, trade, opportunities, but, also, unsettled, the, currency, for, the, next, 200, years, 41, the, first, monetary, changes, in, 1344, consisted, of, the, resulting, gold, silver, ratio, of, 1, 12, 55, was, much, higher, than, the, ratio, of, 1, 11, prevailing, in, the, continent, draining, england, of, its, silver, coinage, and, requiring, a, more, permanent, remedy, in, 1351, in, the, form, of, these, gold, nobles, together, with, half, nobles, 40, pence, and, farthings, or, quarter, nobles, 20, pence, became, the, first, english, gold, coins, produced, in, quantity, the, exigencies, of, the, hundred, years, war, during, the, reign, of, king, henry, iv, resulted, in, further, debasements, toward, the, end, of, his, reign, with, the, english, penny, reduced, to, 15, grains, sterling, silver, 0, 899, g, fine, silver, and, the, half, noble, reduced, to, 54, grains, 3, 481, g, fine, gold, the, gold, silver, ratio, went, down, to, 40, 0, 899, 3, 481, 10, 3, after, the, french, monetary, reform, of, 1425, the, gold, half, noble, 1, 6, th, pound, 40, pence, was, worth, close, to, one, livre, parisis, french, pound, or, 20, sols, while, the, silver, half, groat, 2, pence, fine, silver, 1, 798, g, was, worth, close, to, 1, sol, parisis, 1, 912, g, also, after, the, flemish, monetary, reform, of, 1434, the, new, dutch, florin, was, valued, close, to, 40, pence, while, the, dutch, stuiver, shilling, of, 1, 63, g, fine, silver, was, valued, close, to, 2, pence, sterling, at, 1, 8, g, this, approximate, pairing, of, english, half, nobles, and, half, groats, to, continental, livres, and, sols, persisted, up, to, the, 1560s, the, great, bullion, famine, and, the, great, slump, of, the, mid, 15th, century, resulted, in, another, reduction, in, the, english, penny, to, 12, grains, sterling, silver, 0, 719, g, fine, silver, and, the, introduction, of, a, new, half, angel, gold, coin, of, 40, grains, 2, 578, g, worth, 1, 6, th, pound, or, 40, pence, the, gold, silver, ratio, rose, again, to, 40, 0, 719, 2, 578, 11, 2, the, reduction, in, the, english, penny, approximately, matched, those, with, the, french, sol, parisis, and, the, flemish, stuiver, furthermore, from, 1469, to, 1475, an, agreement, between, england, and, the, burgundian, netherlands, made, the, english, groat, 4, pence, mutually, exchangeable, with, the, burgundian, double, patard, or, 2, stuiver, minted, under, charles, the, rash, 40, pence, or, 1, 6, th, pound, sterling, made, one, troy, ounce, 480, grains, 31, 1035, g, of, sterling, silver, it, was, approximately, on, a, par, with, france, s, livre, parisis, of, one, french, ounce, 30, 594, g, and, in, 1524, it, would, also, be, the, model, for, a, standardised, german, currency, in, the, form, of, the, guldengroschen, which, also, weighed, 1, german, ounce, of, silver, or, 29, 232, g, 0, 9398, ozt, 361, the, last, significant, depreciation, in, sterling, s, silver, standard, occurred, amidst, the, 16th, century, influx, of, precious, metals, from, the, americas, arriving, through, the, habsburg, netherlands, enforcement, of, monetary, standards, amongst, its, constituent, provinces, was, loose, spending, under, king, henry, viii, was, extravagant, and, england, loosened, the, importation, of, cheaper, continental, coins, for, exchange, into, full, valued, english, coins, all, these, contributed, to, the, great, debasement, which, resulted, in, a, significant, 1, 3, rd, reduction, in, the, bullion, content, of, each, pound, sterling, in, 1551, the, troy, ounce, of, sterling, silver, was, henceforth, raised, in, price, by, 50, from, 40, to, 60, silver, pennies, each, penny, weighing, 8, grains, sterling, silver, and, containing, 0, 4795, g, 0, 01542, ozt, fine, silver, the, gold, half, angel, of, 40, grains, 2, 578, g, 0, 0829, ozt, fine, gold, was, raised, in, price, from, 40, pence, to, 60, pence, 5, shillings, or, 1, 4, pound, and, was, henceforth, known, as, the, crown, prior, to, 1551, english, coin, denominations, closely, matched, with, corresponding, sol, 2, d, and, livre, 40, d, denominations, in, the, continent, namely, after, 1551, new, denominations, were, introduced, weighing, similarly, to, 1464, issued, coins, but, increased, in, value, 1, 1, 2, times, namely, the, silver, basis, of, sterling, remained, essentially, unchanged, until, the, 1816, introduction, of, the, gold, standard, save, for, the, increase, in, the, number, of, pennies, in, a, troy, ounce, from, 60, to, 62, hence, 0, 464, g, fine, silver, in, a, penny, its, gold, basis, remained, unsettled, however, until, the, gold, guinea, was, fixed, at, 21, shillings, in, 1717, the, guinea, was, introduced, in, 1663, with, 44, 1, 2, guineas, minted, out, of, 12, troy, ounces, of, 22, karat, gold, hence, 7, 6885, g, fine, gold, and, initially, worth, 1, or, 20, shillings, while, its, price, in, shillings, was, not, legally, fixed, at, first, its, persistent, trade, value, above, 21, shillings, reflected, the, poor, state, of, clipped, underweight, silver, coins, tolerated, for, payment, milled, shillings, of, full, weight, were, hoarded, and, exported, to, the, continent, while, clipped, hand, hammered, shillings, stayed, in, circulation, as, gresham, s, law, describes, in, the, 17th, century, english, merchants, tended, to, pay, for, imports, in, silver, but, were, generally, paid, for, exports, in, gold, this, effect, was, notably, driven, by, trade, with, the, far, east, as, the, chinese, insisted, on, payments, for, their, exports, being, settled, in, silver, from, the, mid, 17th, century, around, 28, 000, metric, tons, 27, 600, long, tons, of, silver, were, received, by, china, principally, from, european, powers, in, exchange, for, chinese, tea, and, other, goods, in, order, to, be, able, to, purchase, chinese, exports, in, this, period, england, initially, had, to, export, to, other, european, nations, and, request, payment, in, silver, until, the, british, east, india, company, was, able, to, foster, the, indirect, sale, of, opium, to, the, chinese, domestic, demand, for, silver, bullion, in, britain, further, reduced, silver, coinage, in, circulation, as, the, improving, fortunes, of, the, merchant, class, led, to, increased, demand, for, tableware, silversmiths, had, always, regarded, coinage, as, a, source, of, raw, material, already, verified, for, fineness, by, the, government, as, a, result, sterling, silver, coins, were, being, melted, and, fashioned, into, sterling, silverware, at, an, accelerating, rate, an, act, of, the, parliament, of, england, in, 1697, tried, to, stem, this, tide, by, raising, the, minimum, acceptable, fineness, on, wrought, plate, from, sterling, s, 92, 5, to, a, new, britannia, silver, standard, of, 95, 83, silverware, made, purely, from, melted, coins, would, be, found, wanting, when, the, silversmith, took, his, wares, to, the, assay, office, thus, discouraging, the, melting, of, coins, during, the, time, of, sir, isaac, newton, master, of, the, mint, the, gold, guinea, was, fixed, at, 21, shillings, 1, 1, in, 1717, but, without, addressing, the, problem, of, underweight, silver, coins, and, with, the, high, resulting, gold, silver, ratio, of, 15, 2, it, gave, sterling, a, firmer, footing, in, gold, guineas, rather, than, silver, shillings, resulting, in, a, de, facto, gold, standard, silver, and, copper, tokens, issued, by, private, entities, partly, relieved, the, problem, of, small, change, until, the, great, recoinage, of, 1816, the, bank, of, england, was, founded, in, 1694, followed, by, the, bank, of, scotland, a, year, later, the, bank, of, england, began, to, issue, banknotes, from, the, late, 1600s, in, the, 17th, century, scots, currency, was, pegged, to, sterling, at, a, value, of, 12, scots, 1, sterling, in, 1707, the, kingdoms, of, england, and, scotland, merged, into, the, kingdom, of, great, britain, in, accordance, with, the, treaty, of, union, the, currency, of, great, britain, was, sterling, with, the, pound, scots, soon, being, replaced, by, sterling, at, the, pegged, value, in, 1801, great, britain, and, the, kingdom, of, ireland, were, united, to, form, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, however, the, irish, pound, was, not, replaced, by, sterling, until, january, 1826, the, conversion, rate, had, long, been, 13, irish, to, 12, sterling, in, 1928, six, years, after, the, anglo, irish, treaty, restored, irish, autonomy, within, the, british, empire, the, irish, free, state, established, a, new, irish, pound, initially, pegged, at, par, to, sterling, sterling, circulated, in, much, of, the, british, empire, in, some, areas, it, was, used, alongside, local, currencies, for, example, the, gold, sovereign, was, legal, tender, in, canada, despite, the, use, of, the, canadian, dollar, several, colonies, and, dominions, adopted, the, pound, as, their, own, currency, these, included, australia, barbados, british, west, africa, cyprus, fiji, british, india, the, irish, free, state, jamaica, new, zealand, south, africa, and, southern, rhodesia, some, of, these, retained, parity, with, sterling, throughout, their, existence, e, g, the, south, african, pound, while, others, deviated, from, parity, after, the, end, of, the, gold, standard, e, g, the, australian, pound, these, currencies, and, others, tied, to, sterling, constituted, the, core, of, the, sterling, area, the, original, english, colonies, on, mainland, north, america, were, not, party, to, the, sterling, area, because, the, above, mentioned, silver, shortage, in, england, coincided, with, these, colonies, formative, years, as, a, result, of, equitable, trade, and, rather, less, equitable, piracy, the, spanish, milled, dollar, became, the, most, common, coin, within, the, english, colonies, during, the, american, war, of, independence, and, the, napoleonic, wars, bank, of, england, notes, were, legal, tender, and, their, value, floated, relative, to, gold, the, bank, also, issued, silver, tokens, to, alleviate, the, shortage, of, silver, coins, in, 1816, the, gold, standard, was, adopted, officially, with, silver, coins, minted, at, a, rate, of, 66, shillings, to, a, troy, pound, weight, of, sterling, silver, thus, rendering, them, as, token, issues, i, e, not, containing, their, value, in, precious, metal, in, 1817, the, sovereign, was, introduced, valued, at, 20, struck, in, 22, carat, gold, it, contained, 113, grains, or, 7, 32238, g, 0, 235420, ozt, of,

joining, the, latin, monetary, union, was, discussed, and, a, royal, commission, on, international, coinage, examined, the, issues, resulting, in, a, decision, against, joining, it, the, gold, standard, was, suspended, at, the, outbreak, of, first, world, war, in, 1914, with, bank, of, england, and, treasury, notes, becoming, legal, tender, before, that, war, the, united, kingdom, had, one, of, the, world, s, strongest, economies, holding, 40, of, the, world, s, overseas, investments, but, after, the, end, of, the, war, the, country, was, highly, indebted, britain, owed, 850, million, about, 52, 3, billion, today, with, interest, costing, the, country, some, 40, of, all, government, spending, the, british, government, under, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, and, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, austen, chamberlain, tried, to, make, up, for, the, deficit, with, a, deflationary, policy, but, this, only, led, to, the, depression, of, 1920, 21, by, 1917, production, of, gold, sovereigns, had, almost, halted, the, remaining, production, was, for, collector, s, sets, and, other, very, specific, occasions, and, by, 1920, the, silver, coinage, was, debased, from, its, original, 925, fine, to, just, 500, fine, that, was, due, to, a, drastic, increase, in, silver, prices, from, an, average, 27, 6, d, per, troy, pound, in, the, period, between, 1894, and, 1913, to, 89, 6, d, in, august, 1920, to, try, to, resume, stability, a, version, of, the, gold, standard, was, reintroduced, in, 1925, under, which, the, currency, was, fixed, to, gold, at, its, pre, war, peg, but, one, could, only, exchange, currency, for, gold, bullion, not, for, coins, on, 21, september, 1931, this, was, abandoned, during, the, great, depression, and, sterling, suffered, an, initial, devaluation, of, some, 25, since, the, suspension, of, the, gold, standard, in, 1931, sterling, has, been, a, fiat, currency, with, its, value, determined, by, its, continued, acceptance, in, the, national, and, international, economy, in, 1940, an, agreement, with, the, us, pegged, sterling, to, the, us, dollar, at, a, rate, of, 1, us, 4, 03, only, the, year, before, it, had, been, us, 4, 86, this, rate, was, maintained, through, the, second, world, war, and, became, part, of, the, bretton, woods, system, which, governed, post, war, exchange, rates, under, continuing, economic, pressure, and, despite, months, of, denials, that, it, would, do, so, on, 19, september, 1949, the, government, devalued, the, pound, by, 30, 5, to, us, 2, 80, the, 1949, sterling, devaluation, prompted, several, other, currencies, to, be, devalued, against, the, dollar, in, 1961, 1964, and, 1966, sterling, came, under, renewed, pressure, as, speculators, were, selling, pounds, for, dollars, in, summer, 1966, with, the, value, of, the, pound, falling, in, the, currency, markets, exchange, controls, were, tightened, by, the, wilson, government, among, the, measures, tourists, were, banned, from, taking, more, than, 50, out, of, the, country, in, travellers, cheques, and, remittances, plus, 15, in, cash, this, restriction, was, not, lifted, until, 1979, sterling, was, devalued, by, 14, 3, to, 1, us, 2, 40, on, 18, november, 1967, until, decimalisation, amounts, in, sterling, were, expressed, in, pounds, shillings, and, pence, with, various, widely, understood, notations, the, same, amount, could, be, stated, as, 32, s, 6, d, 32, 6, 1, 12, s, 6, d, or, 1, 12, 6, it, was, customary, to, specify, some, prices, for, example, professional, fees, and, auction, prices, for, works, of, art, in, guineas, abbr, gn, or, gns, although, guinea, coins, were, no, longer, in, use, formal, parliamentary, proposals, to, decimalise, sterling, were, first, made, in, 1824, when, sir, john, wrottesley, mp, for, staffordshire, asked, in, the, house, of, commons, whether, consideration, had, been, given, to, decimalising, the, currency, wrottesley, raised, the, issue, in, the, house, of, commons, again, in, 1833, and, it, was, again, raised, by, john, bowring, mp, for, kilmarnock, burghs, in, 1847, whose, efforts, led, to, the, introduction, in, 1848, of, what, was, in, effect, the, first, decimal, coin, in, the, united, kingdom, the, florin, valued, at, one, tenth, of, a, pound, however, full, decimalisation, was, resisted, although, the, florin, coin, re, designated, as, ten, new, pence, survived, the, transfer, to, a, full, decimal, system, in, 1971, with, examples, surviving, in, british, coinage, until, 1993, john, benjamin, smith, mp, for, stirling, burghs, raised, the, issue, of, full, decimalisation, again, in, parliament, in, 1853, resulting, in, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, william, gladstone, announcing, soon, afterwards, that, the, great, question, of, a, decimal, coinage, was, now, under, serious, consideration, a, full, proposal, for, the, decimalisation, of, sterling, was, then, tabled, in, the, house, of, commons, in, june, 1855, by, william, brown, mp, for, lancashire, southern, with, the, suggestion, that, the, pound, sterling, be, divided, into, one, thousand, parts, each, called, a, mil, or, alternatively, a, farthing, as, the, pound, was, then, equivalent, to, 960, farthings, which, could, easily, be, rounded, up, to, one, thousand, farthings, in, the, new, system, this, did, not, result, in, the, conversion, of, sterling, into, a, decimal, system, but, it, was, agreed, to, establish, a, royal, commission, to, look, into, the, issue, however, largely, due, to, the, hostility, to, decimalisation, of, two, of, the, appointed, commissioners, lord, overstone, a, banker, and, john, hubbard, governor, of, the, bank, of, england, decimalisation, in, britain, was, effectively, quashed, for, over, a, hundred, years, however, sterling, was, decimalised, in, various, british, colonial, territories, before, the, united, kingdom, and, in, several, cases, in, line, with, william, brown, s, proposal, that, the, pound, be, divided, into, 1, 000, parts, called, mils, these, included, hong, kong, from, 1863, to, 1866, cyprus, from, 1955, until, 1960, and, continued, on, the, island, as, the, division, of, the, cypriot, pound, until, 1983, and, the, palestine, mandate, from, 1926, until, 1948, later, in, 1966, the, uk, government, decided, to, include, in, the, queen, s, speech, a, plan, to, convert, sterling, into, a, decimal, currency, as, a, result, of, this, on, 15, february, 1971, the, uk, decimalised, sterling, replacing, the, shilling, and, the, penny, with, a, single, subdivision, the, new, penny, which, was, worth, 2, 4, d, for, example, a, price, tag, of, 1, 12, 6, became, 1, 62, 1, 2, the, word, new, was, omitted, from, coins, minted, after, 1981, with, the, breakdown, of, the, bretton, woods, system, sterling, floated, from, august, 1971, onwards, at, first, it, appreciated, a, little, rising, to, almost, us, 2, 65, in, march, 1972, from, us, 2, 42, the, upper, bound, of, the, band, in, which, it, had, been, fixed, the, sterling, area, effectively, ended, at, this, time, when, the, majority, of, its, members, also, chose, to, float, freely, against, sterling, and, the, dollar, james, callaghan, became, prime, minister, in, 1976, he, was, immediately, told, the, economy, was, facing, huge, problems, according, to, documents, released, in, 2006, by, the, national, archives, the, effects, of, the, failed, barber, boom, and, the, 1973, oil, crisis, were, still, being, felt, with, inflation, rising, to, nearly, 27, in, 1975, financial, markets, were, beginning, to, believe, the, pound, was, overvalued, and, in, april, that, year, the, wall, street, journal, advised, the, sale, of, sterling, investments, in, the, face, of, high, taxes, in, a, story, that, ended, with, goodbye, great, britain, it, was, nice, knowing, you, at, the, time, the, uk, government, was, running, a, budget, deficit, and, the, labour, government, s, strategy, emphasised, high, public, spending, callaghan, was, told, there, were, three, possible, outcomes, a, disastrous, free, fall, in, sterling, an, internationally, unacceptable, siege, economy, or, a, deal, with, key, allies, to, prop, up, the, pound, while, painful, economic, reforms, were, put, in, place, the, us, government, feared, the, crisis, could, endanger, nato, and, the, european, economic, community, eec, and, in, light, of, this, the, us, treasury, set, out, to, force, domestic, policy, changes, in, november, 1976, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, announced, the, conditions, for, a, loan, including, deep, cuts, in, public, expenditure, the, conservative, party, was, elected, to, office, in, 1979, on, a, programme, of, fiscal, austerity, initially, sterling, rocketed, moving, above, 1, to, us, 2, 40, as, interest, rates, rose, in, response, to, the, monetarist, policy, of, targeting, money, supply, the, high, exchange, rate, was, widely, blamed, for, the, deep, recession, of, 1981, sterling, fell, sharply, after, 1980, at, its, lowest, 1, stood, at, just, us, 1, 03, in, march, 1985, before, rising, to, us, 1, 70, in, december, 1989, in, 1988, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, nigel, lawson, decided, that, sterling, should, shadow, the, deutsche, mark, dm, with, the, unintended, result, of, a, rapid, rise, in, inflation, as, the, economy, boomed, due, to, low, interest, rates, following, german, reunification, in, 1990, the, reverse, held, true, as, high, german, borrowing, costs, to, fund, eastern, reconstruction, exacerbated, by, the, political, decision, to, convert, the, ostmark, to, the, d, mark, on, a, 1, 1, basis, meant, that, interest, rates, in, other, countries, shadowing, the, d, mark, especially, the, uk, were, far, too, high, relative, to, domestic, circumstances, leading, to, a, housing, decline, and, recession, on, 8, october, 1990, the, conservative, government, third, thatcher, ministry, decided, to, join, the, european, exchange, rate, mechanism, erm, with, 1, set, at, dm, 2, 95, however, the, country, was, forced, to, withdraw, from, the, system, on, black, wednesday, 16, september, 1992, as, britain, s, economic, performance, made, the, exchange, rate, unsustainable, the, event, was, also, triggered, by, comments, by, bundesbank, president, helmut, schlesinger, who, suggested, the, pound, would, eventually, have, to, be, devalued, black, wednesday, saw, interest, rates, jump, from, 10, to, 15, in, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, stop, the, pound, from, falling, below, the, erm, limits, the, exchange, rate, fell, to, dm, 2, 20, those, who, had, argued, for, a, lower, gbp, dm, exchange, rate, were, vindicated, since, the, cheaper, pound, encouraged, exports, and, contributed, to, the, economic, prosperity, of, the, 1990s, in, 1997, the, newly, elected, labour, government, handed, over, day, to, day, control, of, interest, rates, to, the, bank, of, england, a, policy, that, had, originally, been, advocated, by, the, liberal, democrats, the, bank, is, now, responsible, for, setting, its, base, rate, of, interest, so, as, to, keep, inflation, as, measured, by, the, consumer, price, index, cpi, very, close, to, 2, per, annum, should, cpi, inflation, be, more, than, one, percentage, point, above, or, below, the, target, the, governor, of, the, bank, of, england, is, required, to, write, an, open, letter, to, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, explaining, the, reasons, for, this, and, the, measures, which, will, be, taken, to, bring, this, measure, of, inflation, back, in, line, with, the, 2, target, on, 17, april, 2007, annual, cpi, inflation, was, reported, at, 3, 1, inflation, of, the, retail, prices, index, was, 4, 8, accordingly, and, for, the, first, time, the, governor, had, to, write, publicly, to, the, uk, government, explaining, why, inflation, was, more, than, one, percentage, point, higher, than, its, target, in, 2007, gordon, brown, then, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, ruled, out, membership, in, the, eurozone, for, the, foreseeable, future, saying, that, the, decision, not, to, join, had, been, right, for, britain, and, for, europe, on, 1, january, 2008, with, the, republic, of, cyprus, switching, its, currency, from, the, cypriot, pound, to, the, euro, the, british, sovereign, bases, on, cyprus, akrotiri, and, dhekelia, followed, suit, making, the, sovereign, base, areas, the, only, territory, under, british, sovereignty, to, officially, use, the, euro, the, government, of, former, prime, minister, tony, blair, had, pledged, to, hold, a, public, referendum, to, decide, on, the, adoption, of, the, euro, should, five, economic, tests, be, met, to, increase, the, likelihood, that, any, adoption, of, the, euro, would, be, in, the, national, interest, in, addition, to, these, internal, national, criteria, the, uk, would, have, to, meet, the, european, union, s, economic, convergence, criteria, maastricht, criteria, before, being, allowed, to, adopt, the, euro, the, conservative, and, liberal, democrat, coalition, government, 2010, 2015, ruled, out, joining, the, euro, for, that, parliamentary, term, the, idea, of, replacing, sterling, with, the, euro, was, always, controversial, with, the, british, public, partly, because, of, sterling, s, identity, as, a, symbol, of, british, sovereignty, and, because, it, would, according, to, some, critics, have, led, to, suboptimal, interest, rates, harming, the, british, economy, in, december, 2008, the, results, of, a, bbc, poll, of, 1, 000, people, suggested, that, 71, would, vote, no, to, the, euro, 23, would, vote, yes, while, 6, said, they, were, unsure, sterling, did, not, join, the, second, european, exchange, rate, mechanism, erm, ii, after, the, euro, was, created, denmark, and, the, uk, had, opt, outs, from, entry, to, the, euro, theoretically, every, eu, nation, but, denmark, must, eventually, sign, up, as, a, member, of, the, european, union, the, united, kingdom, could, have, adopted, the, euro, as, its, currency, however, the, subject, was, always, politically, controversial, and, the, uk, negotiated, an, opt, out, on, this, issue, following, the, uk, s, withdrawal, from, the, eu, on, 31, january, 2020, the, bank, of, england, ended, its, membership, of, the, european, system, of, central, banks, and, shares, in, the, european, central, bank, were, reallocated, to, other, eu, banks, sterling, and, the, euro, fluctuate, in, value, against, one, another, although, there, may, be, correlation, between, movements, in, their, respective, exchange, rates, with, other, currencies, such, as, the, us, dollar, inflation, concerns, in, the, uk, led, the, bank, of, england, to, raise, interest, rates, in, late, 2006, and, 2007, this, caused, sterling, to, appreciate, against, other, major, currencies, and, with, the, us, dollar, depreciating, at, the, same, time, sterling, hit, a, 15, year, high, against, the, us, dollar, on, 18, april, 2007, with, 1, reaching, us, 2, the, day, before, for, the, first, time, since, 1992, sterling, and, many, other, currencies, continued, to, appreciate, against, the, dollar, sterling, hit, a, 26, year, high, of, 1, to, us, 2, 1161, on, 7, november, 2007, as, the, dollar, fell, worldwide, from, mid, 2003, to, mid, 2007, the, pound, euro, rate, remained, within, a, narrow, range, 1, 45, 5, following, the, global, financial, crisis, in, late, 2008, sterling, depreciated, sharply, declining, to, 1, to, us, 1, 38, on, 23, january, 2009, and, falling, below, 1, to, 1, 25, against, the, euro, in, april, 2008, there, was, a, further, decline, during, the, remainder, of, 2008, most, dramatically, on, 29, december, when, its, euro, rate, hit, an, all, time, low, at, 1, 0219, while, its, us, dollar, rate, depreciated, sterling, appreciated, in, early, 2009, reaching, a, peak, against, the, euro, of, 1, to, 1, 17, in, mid, july, in, the, following, months, sterling, remained, broadly, steady, against, the, euro, with, 1, valued, on, 27, may, 2011, at, 1, 15, and, us, 1, 65, on, 5, march, 2009, the, bank, of, england, announced, that, it, would, pump, 75, billion, of, new, capital, into, the, british, economy, through, a, process, known, as, quantitative, easing, qe, this, was, the, first, time, in, the, united, kingdom, s, history, that, this, measure, had, been, used, although, the, bank, s, governor, mervyn, king, suggested, it, was, not, an, experiment, the, process, saw, the, bank, of, england, creating, new, money, for, itself, which, it, then, used, to, purchase, assets, such, as, government, bonds, secured, commercial, paper, or, corporate, bonds, the, initial, amount, stated, to, be, created, through, this, method, was, 75, billion, although, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, alistair, darling, had, given, permission, for, up, to, 150, billion, to, be, created, if, necessary, it, was, expected, that, the, process, would, continue, for, three, months, with, results, only, likely, in, the, long, term, by, 5, november, 2009, some, 175, billion, had, been, injected, using, qe, and, the, process, remained, less, effective, in, the, long, term, in, july, 2012, the, final, increase, in, qe, meant, it, had, peaked, at, 375, billion, then, holding, solely, uk, government, bonds, representing, one, third, of, the, uk, national, debt, the, result, of, the, 2016, uk, referendum, on, eu, membership, caused, a, major, decline, in, sterling, against, other, world, currencies, as, the, future, of, international, trade, relationships, and, domestic, political, leadership, became, unclear, the, referendum, result, weakened, sterling, against, the, euro, by, 5, overnight, the, night, before, the, vote, sterling, was, trading, at, 1,

down, to, 1, to, 1, 2232, by, october, 2016, a, fall, of, 16, in, september, 2022, under, the, influence, of, inflation, and, tax, cuts, funded, by, borrowing, sterling, s, value, reached, an, all, time, low, of, just, over, 1, 03, the, bank, of, england, had, stated, in, 2009, that, the, decision, had, been, taken, to, prevent, the, rate, of, inflation, falling, below, the, 2, target, rate, mervyn, king, the, governor, of, the, bank, of, england, had, also, suggested, there, were, no, other, monetary, options, left, as, interest, rates, had, already, been, cut, to, their, lowest, level, ever, 0, 5, and, it, was, unlikely, that, they, would, be, cut, further, the, inflation, rate, rose, in, following, years, reaching, 5, 2, per, year, based, on, the, consumer, price, index, in, september, 2011, then, decreased, to, around, 2, 5, the, following, year, after, a, number, of, years, when, inflation, remained, near, or, below, the, bank, s, 2, target, 2021, saw, a, significant,
