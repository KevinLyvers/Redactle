hindustani, is, an, indo, aryan, language, spoken, in, north, india, and, pakistan, and, functioning, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, region, it, is, also, spoken, by, the, deccani, people, hindustani, is, a, pluricentric, language, with, two, standard, registers, known, as, hindi, written, in, devanagari, script, and, influenced, by, sanskrit, and, urdu, written, in, perso, arabic, script, and, influenced, by, persian, and, arabic, which, serve, as, official, languages, of, india, and, pakistan, respectively, thus, it, is, also, called, hindi, urdu, colloquial, registers, of, the, language, fall, on, a, spectrum, between, these, standards, in, modern, times, a, third, variety, of, hindustani, with, significant, english, influences, has, also, appeared, which, is, sometimes, called, hinglish, or, urdish, the, concept, of, a, hindustani, language, as, a, unifying, language, or, fusion, language, that, could, transcend, communal, and, religious, divisions, across, the, subcontinent, was, endorsed, by, mahatma, gandhi, as, it, was, not, seen, to, be, associated, with, either, the, hindu, or, muslim, communities, as, was, the, case, with, hindi, and, urdu, respectively, and, it, was, also, considered, a, simpler, language, for, people, to, learn, the, conversion, from, hindi, to, urdu, or, vice, versa, is, generally, achieved, just, by, transliteration, between, the, two, scripts, instead, of, translation, which, is, generally, only, required, for, religious, and, literary, texts, scholars, trace, the, language, s, first, written, poetry, in, the, form, of, old, hindi, to, the, delhi, sultanate, era, around, the, twelfth, and, thirteenth, century, during, the, period, of, the, delhi, sultanate, which, covered, most, of, today, s, india, eastern, pakistan, southern, nepal, and, bangladesh, and, which, resulted, in, the, contact, of, hindu, and, muslim, cultures, the, sanskrit, and, prakrit, base, of, old, hindi, became, enriched, with, loanwords, from, persian, evolving, into, the, present, form, of, hindustani, the, hindustani, vernacular, became, an, expression, of, indian, national, unity, during, the, indian, independence, movement, and, continues, to, be, spoken, as, the, common, language, of, the, people, of, the, northern, indian, subcontinent, which, is, reflected, in, the, hindustani, vocabulary, of, bollywood, films, and, songs, the, language, s, core, vocabulary, is, derived, from, prakrit, a, descendant, of, sanskrit, with, substantial, loanwords, from, persian, and, arabic, via, persian, it, is, often, written, in, the, devanagari, script, or, the, arabic, derived, urdu, script, in, the, case, of, hindi, and, urdu, respectively, with, romanisation, increasingly, employed, in, modern, times, as, a, neutral, script, as, of, 2023, hindi, and, urdu, together, constitute, the, 3rd, most, spoken, language, in, the, world, after, english, and, mandarin, with, 843, million, native, and, second, language, speakers, according, to, ethnologue, though, this, includes, millions, who, self, reported, their, language, as, hindi, on, the, indian, census, but, speak, a, number, of, other, hindi, languages, than, hindustani, the, total, number, of, hindi, urdu, speakers, was, reported, to, be, over, 300, million, in, 1995, making, hindustani, the, third, or, fourth, most, spoken, language, in, the, world, early, forms, of, present, day, hindustani, developed, from, the, middle, indo, aryan, apabhra, a, vernaculars, of, present, day, north, india, in, the, 7th, 13th, centuries, hindustani, emerged, as, a, contact, language, around, delhi, a, result, of, the, increasing, linguistic, diversity, that, occurred, due, to, muslim, rule, amir, khusrow, who, lived, in, the, thirteenth, century, during, the, delhi, sultanate, period, in, north, india, used, these, forms, which, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, period, in, his, writings, and, referred, to, it, as, hindavi, persian, lit, of, hind, or, india, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, military, exploits, of, alauddin, khalji, introduced, the, language, in, the, deccan, region, which, led, to, the, development, of, its, southern, dialect, deccani, which, was, promoted, by, muslim, rulers, in, the, deccan, the, delhi, sultanate, which, comprised, several, turkic, and, afghan, dynasties, that, ruled, much, of, the, subcontinent, from, delhi, was, succeeded, by, the, mughal, empire, in, 1526, and, preceded, by, the, ghorid, dynasty, and, ghaznavid, empire, before, that, ancestors, of, the, language, were, known, as, hindui, hindavi, zab, n, e, hind, transl, language, of, india, zab, n, e, hindustan, transl, language, of, hindustan, hindustan, ki, boli, transl, language, of, hindustan, rekhta, and, hindi, its, regional, dialects, became, known, as, zab, n, e, dakhani, in, southern, india, zab, n, e, gujari, transl, language, of, gujars, in, gujarat, and, as, zab, n, e, dehlavi, or, urdu, around, delhi, it, is, an, indo, aryan, language, deriving, its, base, primarily, from, the, western, hindi, dialect, of, delhi, also, known, as, khariboli, although, the, mughals, were, of, timurid, gurk, n, turco, mongol, descent, they, were, persianised, and, persian, had, gradually, become, the, state, language, of, the, mughal, empire, after, babur, a, continuation, since, the, introduction, of, persian, by, central, asian, turkic, rulers, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, the, patronisation, of, it, by, the, earlier, turko, afghan, delhi, sultanate, the, basis, in, general, for, the, introduction, of, persian, into, the, subcontinent, was, set, from, its, earliest, days, by, various, persianised, central, asian, turkic, and, afghan, dynasties, hindustani, began, to, take, shape, as, a, persianised, vernacular, during, the, delhi, sultanate, 1206, 1526, ad, and, mughal, empire, 1526, 1858, ad, in, south, asia, hindustani, retained, the, grammar, and, core, vocabulary, of, the, local, delhi, dialect, however, as, an, emerging, common, dialect, hindustani, absorbed, large, numbers, of, persian, arabic, and, turkic, loanwords, and, as, mughal, conquests, grew, it, spread, as, a, lingua, franca, across, much, of, northern, india, this, was, a, result, of, the, contact, of, hindu, and, muslim, cultures, in, hindustan, that, created, a, composite, ganga, jamuni, tehzeeb, the, language, was, also, known, as, rekhta, or, mixed, which, implies, that, it, was, mixed, with, persian, written, in, the, perso, arabic, devanagari, and, occasionally, kaithi, or, gurmukhi, scripts, it, remained, the, primary, lingua, franca, of, northern, india, for, the, next, four, centuries, although, it, varied, significantly, in, vocabulary, depending, on, the, local, language, alongside, persian, it, achieved, the, status, of, a, literary, language, in, muslim, courts, and, was, also, used, for, literary, purposes, in, various, other, settings, such, as, sufi, nirgun, sant, krishna, bhakta, circles, and, rajput, hindu, courts, its, majors, centres, of, development, included, the, mughal, courts, of, delhi, lucknow, agra, and, lahore, as, well, as, the, rajput, courts, of, amber, and, jaipur, in, the, 18th, century, towards, the, end, of, the, mughal, period, with, the, fragmentation, of, the, empire, and, the, elite, system, a, variant, of, hindustani, one, of, the, successors, of, apabhra, a, vernaculars, at, delhi, and, nearby, cities, came, to, gradually, replace, persian, as, the, lingua, franca, among, the, educated, elite, upper, class, particularly, in, northern, india, though, persian, still, retained, much, of, its, pre, eminence, for, a, short, period, the, term, hindustani, was, given, to, that, language, the, perso, arabic, script, form, of, this, language, underwent, a, standardisation, process, and, further, persianisation, during, this, period, 18th, century, and, came, to, be, known, as, urdu, a, name, derived, from, persian, zab, n, e, urd, e, mualla, language, of, the, court, or, zab, n, e, urd, language, of, the, camp, the, etymology, of, the, word, urdu, is, of, chagatai, origin, ord, camp, cognate, with, english, horde, and, known, in, local, translation, as, lashkari, zab, n, which, is, shortened, to, lashkari, this, is, all, due, to, its, origin, as, the, common, speech, of, the, mughal, army, as, a, literary, language, urdu, took, shape, in, courtly, elite, settings, along, with, english, it, became, the, first, official, language, of, british, india, in, 1850, hindi, as, a, standardised, literary, register, of, the, hindustani, arose, in, the, 19th, century, while, the, first, literary, works, mostly, translations, of, earlier, works, in, sanskritised, hindustani, were, already, written, in, the, early, 19th, century, as, part, of, a, literary, project, that, included, both, hindu, and, muslim, writers, e, g, lallu, lal, insha, allah, khan, the, call, for, a, distinct, sanskritised, standard, of, hindustani, written, in, devanagari, under, the, name, of, hindi, became, increasingly, politicised, in, the, course, of, the, century, and, gained, pace, around, 1880, in, an, effort, to, displace, urdu, s, official, position, john, fletcher, hurst, in, his, book, published, in, 1891, mentioned, that, the, hindustani, or, camp, language, of, the, mughal, empire, s, courts, at, delhi, was, not, regarded, by, philologists, as, a, distinct, language, but, only, as, a, dialect, of, hindi, with, admixture, of, persian, he, continued, but, it, has, all, the, magnitude, and, importance, of, separate, language, it, is, linguistic, result, of, muslim, rule, of, eleventh, twelfth, centuries, and, is, spoken, except, in, rural, bengal, by, many, hindus, in, north, india, and, by, musalman, population, in, all, parts, of, india, next, to, english, it, was, the, official, language, of, british, raj, was, commonly, written, in, arabic, or, persian, characters, and, was, spoken, by, approximately, 100, 000, 000, people, the, process, of, hybridization, also, led, to, the, formation, of, words, in, which, the, first, element, of, the, compound, was, from, khari, boli, and, the, second, from, persian, such, as, rajmahal, palace, raja, royal, king, mahal, house, place, and, rangmahal, fashion, house, rang, colour, dye, mahal, house, place, as, muslim, rule, expanded, hindustani, speakers, traveled, to, distant, parts, of, india, as, administrators, soldiers, merchants, and, artisans, as, it, reached, new, areas, hindustani, further, hybridized, with, local, languages, in, the, deccan, for, instance, hindustani, blended, with, telugu, and, came, to, be, called, dakhani, in, dakhani, aspirated, consonants, were, replaced, with, their, unaspirated, counterparts, for, instance, dekh, see, became, dek, ghula, dissolved, became, gula, kuch, some, became, kuc, and, samajh, understand, became, samaj, when, the, british, colonised, the, indian, subcontinent, from, the, late, 18th, through, to, the, late, 19th, century, they, used, the, words, hindustani, hindi, and, urdu, interchangeably, they, developed, it, as, the, language, of, administration, of, british, india, further, preparing, it, to, be, the, official, language, of, modern, india, and, pakistan, however, with, independence, use, of, the, word, hindustani, declined, being, largely, replaced, by, hindi, and, urdu, or, hindi, urdu, when, either, of, those, was, too, specific, more, recently, the, word, hindustani, has, been, used, for, the, colloquial, language, of, bollywood, films, which, are, popular, in, both, india, and, pakistan, and, which, cannot, be, unambiguously, identified, as, either, hindi, or, urdu, british, rule, over, india, also, introduced, some, english, words, into, hindustani, with, these, influences, increasing, with, the, later, spread, of, english, as, a, world, language, this, has, created, a, new, variant, of, hindustani, known, as, hinglish, although, at, the, spoken, level, hindi, and, urdu, are, considered, registers, of, a, single, language, hindustani, or, hindi, urdu, as, they, share, a, common, grammar, and, core, vocabulary, they, differ, in, literary, and, formal, vocabulary, where, literary, hindi, draws, heavily, on, sanskrit, and, to, a, lesser, extent, prakrit, literary, urdu, draws, heavily, on, persian, and, arabic, loanwords, the, grammar, and, base, vocabulary, most, pronouns, verbs, adpositions, etc, of, both, hindi, and, urdu, however, are, the, same, and, derive, from, a, prakritic, base, and, both, have, persian, arabic, influence, the, standardised, registers, hindi, and, urdu, are, collectively, known, as, hindi, urdu, hindustani, is, the, lingua, franca, of, the, north, and, west, of, the, indian, subcontinent, though, it, is, understood, fairly, well, in, other, regions, also, especially, in, the, urban, areas, this, has, led, it, to, be, characterised, as, a, continuum, that, ranges, between, hindi, and, urdu, a, common, vernacular, sharing, characteristics, with, sanskritised, hindi, regional, hindi, and, urdu, hindustani, is, more, commonly, used, as, a, vernacular, than, highly, sanskritised, hindi, or, highly, persianised, urdu, this, can, be, seen, in, the, popular, culture, of, bollywood, or, more, generally, the, vernacular, of, north, indians, and, pakistanis, which, generally, employs, a, lexicon, common, to, both, hindi, and, urdu, speakers, minor, subtleties, in, region, will, also, affect, the, brand, of, hindustani, sometimes, pushing, the, hindustani, closer, to, urdu, or, to, hindi, one, might, reasonably, assume, that, the, hindustani, spoken, in, lucknow, uttar, pradesh, known, for, its, usage, of, urdu, and, varanasi, a, holy, city, for, hindus, and, thus, using, highly, sanskritised, hindi, is, somewhat, different, standard, hindi, one, of, the, 22, officially, recognized, languages, of, india, and, the, official, language, of, the, union, is, usually, written, in, the, indigenous, devanagari, script, of, india, and, exhibits, less, persian, and, arabic, influence, than, urdu, it, has, a, literature, of, 500, years, with, prose, poetry, religion, and, philosophy, one, could, conceive, of, a, wide, spectrum, of, dialects, and, registers, with, the, highly, persianised, urdu, at, one, end, of, the, spectrum, and, a, heavily, sanskritised, variety, spoken, in, the, region, around, varanasi, at, the, other, end, in, common, usage, in, india, the, term, hindi, includes, all, these, dialects, except, those, at, the, urdu, spectrum, thus, the, different, meanings, of, the, word, hindi, include, among, others, urdu, is, the, national, language, and, state, language, of, pakistan, and, one, of, the, 22, officially, recognised, languages, of, india, it, is, written, except, in, some, parts, of, india, in, the, nastaliq, style, of, the, urdu, alphabet, an, extended, perso, arabic, script, incorporating, indic, phonemes, it, is, heavily, influenced, by, persian, vocabulary, and, was, historically, also, known, as, rekhta, as, dakhini, or, deccani, where, it, also, draws, words, from, local, languages, it, survives, and, enjoys, a, rich, history, in, the, deccan, and, other, parts, of, south, india, with, the, prestige, dialect, being, hyderabadi, urdu, spoken, in, and, around, the, capital, of, the, nizams, and, the, deccan, sultanates, earliest, forms, of, the, language, s, literature, may, be, traced, back, to, the, 13th, 14th, century, works, of, am, r, khusrau, dehlav, often, called, the, father, of, urdu, literature, while, wal, deccani, is, seen, as, the, progenitor, of, urdu, poetry, the, term, bazaar, hindustani, in, other, words, the, street, talk, or, literally, marketplace, hindustani, also, known, as, colloquial, hindi, or, simplified, urdu, has, arisen, to, denote, a, colloquial, register, of, the, language, that, uses, vocabulary, common, to, both, hindi, and, urdu, while, eschewing, high, register, and, specialized, arabic, or, sanskrit, derived, words, it, has, emerged, in, various, south, asian, cities, where, hindustani, is, not, the, main, language, in, order, to, facilitate, communication, across, language, barriers, it, is, characterized, by, loanwords, from, local, languages, hinglish, is, the, macaronic, hybrid, use, of, english, and, the, hindustani, language, its, name, is, a, portmanteau, of, the, words, hindi, and, english, in, the, context, of, spoken, language, it, involves, code, switching, or, translanguaging, between, these, languages, whereby, they, are, freely, interchanged, within, a, sentence, or, between, sentences, amir, khusro, c, 1300, referred, to, this, language, of, his, writings, as, dehlavi, of, delhi, or, hindavi, during, this, period, hindustani, was, used, by, sufis, in, promulgating, their, message, across, the, indian, subcontinent, after, the, advent, of, the, mughals, in, the, subcontinent, hindustani, acquired, more, persian, loanwords, rekhta, mixture, hindi, indian, hindustani, hindvi, lahori, and, dakni, amongst, others, became, popular, names, for, the, same, language, until, the, 18th, century, the, name, urdu, from, zab, n, i, ordu, or, orda, appeared, around, 1780, it, is, believed, to, have, been, coined, by, the, poet, mashafi, in, local, literature, and, speech, it, was, also, known, as, the, lashkari, zab, n, military, language, or, lashkari, mashafi, was, the, first, person, to, simply, modify, the, name, zab, n, i, ordu, to, urdu, during, the, british, raj, the, term, hindustani, was, used, by, british, officials, in, 1796, john, borthwick, gilchrist, published, a, grammar, of, the, hindoostanee, language, upon, partition, india, and, pakistan, established, national, standards, that, they, called, hindi, and, urdu, respectively, and, attempted, to, make, distinct, with, the, result, that, hindustani, commonly, but, mistakenly, came, to, be, seen, as, a, mixture, of, hindi, and, urdu, grierson, in, his, highly, influential, linguistic, survey, of, india, proposed, that, the, names, hindustani, urdu, and, hindi, be, separated, in, use, for, different, varieties, of, the, hindustani, language, rather, than, as, the, overlapping, synonyms, they, frequently, were, we, may, now, define, the, three, main, varieties, of, hind, st, n, as, follows, hind, st, n, is, primarily, the, language, of, the, upper, gangetic, doab, and, is, also, the, lingua, franca, of, india, capable, of, being, written, in, both, persian, and, d, va, n, gar, characters, and, without, purism, avoiding, alike, the, excessive, use, of, either, persian, or, sanskrit, words, when, employed, for, literature, the, name, urd, can, then, be, confined, to, that, special, variety, of, hind, st, n, in, which, persian, words, are, of, frequent, occurrence, and, which, hence, can, only, be, written, in, the, persian, character, and, similarly, hind, can, be, confined, to, the, form, of, hind, st, n, in, which, sanskrit, words, abound, and, which, hence, can, only, be, written, in, the, d, va, n, gar, character, prior, to, 1947, hindustani, was, officially, recognised, by, the, british, raj, in, the, post, independence, period, however, the, term, hindustani, has, lost, currency, and, is, not, given, any, official, recognition, by, the, indian, or, pakistani, governments, the, language, is, instead, recognised, by, its, standard, forms, hindi, and, urdu, hindi, is, declared, by, article, 343, 1, part, 17, of, the, indian,

also, written, in, devanagari, with, slight, variations, to, establish, a, devanagari, urdu, alphabet, alongside, the, devanagari, hindi, alphabet, because, of, anglicisation, in, south, asia, and,
