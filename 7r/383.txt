chinese, characters, are, logographs, used, to, write, the, chinese, languages, and, others, from, regions, historically, influenced, by, chinese, culture, chinese, characters, have, a, documented, history, spanning, over, three, millennia, representing, one, of, the, four, independent, inventions, of, writing, accepted, by, scholars, of, these, they, comprise, the, only, writing, system, continuously, used, since, its, invention, over, time, the, function, style, and, means, of, writing, characters, have, evolved, greatly, unlike, letters, in, alphabets, that, reflect, the, sounds, of, speech, chinese, characters, generally, represent, morphemes, the, units, of, meaning, in, a, language, writing, a, language, s, entire, vocabulary, requires, thousands, of, different, characters, characters, are, created, according, to, several, different, principles, where, aspects, of, both, shape, and, pronunciation, may, be, used, to, indicate, the, character, s, meaning, the, first, attested, characters, are, oracle, bone, inscriptions, made, during, the, 13th, century, bce, in, what, is, now, anyang, henan, as, part, of, divinations, conducted, by, the, shang, dynasty, royal, house, character, forms, were, originally, highly, pictographic, in, style, but, evolved, over, time, as, writing, spread, across, china, numerous, attempts, have, been, made, to, reform, the, script, including, the, promotion, of, small, seal, script, by, the, qin, dynasty, 221, 206, bce, clerical, script, which, had, matured, by, the, early, han, dynasty, 202, bce, 220, ce, abstracted, the, forms, of, characters, obscuring, their, pictographic, origins, in, favour, of, making, them, easier, to, write, following, the, han, regular, script, emerged, as, the, result, of, cursive, influence, on, clerical, script, and, has, been, the, primary, style, used, for, characters, since, informed, by, a, long, tradition, of, lexicography, states, using, chinese, characters, have, standardised, their, forms, broadly, simplified, characters, are, used, to, write, chinese, in, mainland, china, singapore, and, malaysia, while, traditional, characters, are, used, in, taiwan, hong, kong, and, macau, after, being, introduced, in, order, to, write, literary, chinese, characters, were, often, adapted, to, write, local, languages, spoken, throughout, the, sinosphere, in, japanese, korean, and, vietnamese, chinese, characters, are, known, as, kanji, hanja, and, ch, h, n, respectively, writing, traditions, also, emerged, for, some, of, the, other, languages, of, china, like, the, sawndip, script, used, to, write, the, zhuang, languages, of, guangxi, each, of, these, written, vernaculars, used, existing, characters, to, write, the, language, s, native, vocabulary, as, well, as, the, loanwords, it, borrowed, from, chinese, in, addition, each, invented, characters, for, local, use, in, written, korean, and, vietnamese, chinese, characters, have, largely, been, replaced, with, alphabets, leaving, japanese, as, the, only, major, non, chinese, language, still, written, using, them, at, the, most, basic, level, characters, are, composed, of, strokes, that, are, written, in, a, fixed, order, methods, of, writing, characters, have, historically, included, being, carved, into, stone, being, inked, with, a, brush, onto, silk, bamboo, or, paper, and, being, printed, using, woodblocks, and, moveable, type, technologies, invented, since, the, 19th, century, allowing, for, wider, use, of, characters, include, telegraph, codes, and, typewriters, as, well, as, input, methods, and, text, encodings, on, computers, chinese, characters, are, accepted, as, representing, one, of, four, independent, inventions, of, writing, in, human, history, in, each, instance, writing, evolved, from, a, system, using, two, distinct, types, of, ideographs, ideographs, could, either, be, pictographs, visually, depicting, objects, or, concepts, or, fixed, signs, representing, concepts, only, by, shared, convention, these, systems, are, classified, as, proto, writing, because, the, techniques, they, used, were, insufficient, to, carry, the, meaning, of, spoken, language, by, themselves, various, innovations, were, required, for, chinese, characters, to, emerge, from, proto, writing, firstly, pictographs, became, distinct, from, simple, pictures, in, use, and, appearance, for, example, the, pictograph, meaning, large, was, originally, a, picture, of, a, large, man, but, one, would, need, to, be, aware, of, its, specific, meaning, in, order, to, interpret, the, sequence, as, signifying, large, deer, rather, than, being, a, picture, of, a, large, man, and, a, deer, next, to, one, another, due, to, this, process, of, abstraction, as, well, as, to, make, characters, easier, to, write, pictographs, gradually, became, more, simplified, and, regularised, often, to, the, extent, that, the, original, objects, represented, are, no, longer, obvious, this, proto, writing, system, was, limited, to, representing, a, relatively, narrow, range, of, ideas, with, a, comparatively, small, library, of, symbols, this, compelled, innovations, that, allowed, for, symbols, to, directly, encode, spoken, language, in, each, historical, case, this, was, accomplished, by, some, form, of, the, rebus, technique, where, the, symbol, for, a, word, is, used, to, indicate, a, different, word, with, a, similar, pronunciation, depending, on, context, this, allowed, for, words, that, lacked, a, plausible, pictographic, representation, to, be, written, down, for, the, first, time, this, technique, pre, empted, more, sophisticated, methods, of, character, creation, that, would, further, expand, the, lexicon, the, process, whereby, writing, emerged, from, proto, writing, took, place, over, a, long, period, when, the, purely, pictorial, use, of, symbols, disappeared, leaving, only, those, representing, spoken, words, the, process, was, complete, chinese, characters, have, been, used, in, several, different, writing, systems, throughout, history, the, concept, of, a, writing, system, includes, both, the, written, symbols, themselves, called, graphemes, which, may, include, characters, numerals, or, punctuation, as, well, as, the, rules, by, which, they, are, used, to, record, language, chinese, characters, are, logographs, which, are, graphemes, that, represent, units, of, meaning, in, a, language, specifically, characters, represent, the, smallest, units, of, meaning, in, a, language, which, are, referred, to, as, morphemes, morphemes, in, chinese, and, therefore, the, characters, used, to, write, them, are, nearly, always, a, single, syllable, in, length, in, some, special, cases, characters, may, denote, non, morphemic, syllables, as, well, due, to, this, written, chinese, is, often, characterised, as, morphosyllabic, logographs, may, be, contrasted, with, letters, in, an, alphabet, which, generally, represent, phonemes, the, distinct, units, of, sound, used, by, speakers, of, a, language, despite, their, origins, in, picture, writing, chinese, characters, are, no, longer, ideographs, capable, of, representing, ideas, directly, their, comprehension, relies, on, the, reader, s, knowledge, of, the, particular, language, being, written, the, areas, where, chinese, characters, were, historically, used, sometimes, collectively, termed, the, sinosphere, have, a, long, tradition, of, lexicography, attempting, to, explain, and, refine, their, use, for, most, of, history, analysis, revolved, around, a, model, first, popularised, in, the, 2nd, century, shuowen, jiezi, dictionary, more, recent, models, have, analysed, the, methods, used, to, create, characters, how, characters, are, structured, and, how, they, function, in, a, given, writing, system, most, characters, can, be, analysed, structurally, as, compounds, made, of, smaller, components, b, ji, n, which, are, often, independent, characters, in, their, own, right, adjusted, to, occupy, a, given, position, in, the, compound, components, within, a, character, may, serve, a, specific, function, phonetic, components, provide, a, hint, for, the, character, s, pronunciation, and, semantic, components, indicate, some, element, of, the, character, s, meaning, components, that, serve, neither, function, may, be, classified, as, pure, signs, with, no, particular, meaning, other, than, their, presence, distinguishing, one, character, from, another, a, straightforward, structural, classification, scheme, may, consist, of, three, pure, classes, of, semantographs, phonographs, and, signs, having, only, semantic, phonetic, and, form, components, respectively, as, well, as, classes, corresponding, to, each, combination, of, component, types, of, the, 3500, characters, that, are, frequently, used, in, standard, chinese, pure, semantographs, are, estimated, to, be, the, rarest, accounting, for, about, 5, of, the, lexicon, followed, by, pure, signs, with, 18, and, semantic, form, and, phonetic, form, compounds, together, accounting, for, 19, the, remaining, 58, are, phono, semantic, compounds, the, chinese, palaeographer, qiu, xigui, b, 1935, presents, three, principles, of, character, function, adapted, from, earlier, proposals, by, tang, lan, 1901, 1979, and, chen, mengjia, 1911, 1966, with, semantographs, describing, all, characters, whose, forms, are, wholly, related, to, their, meaning, regardless, of, the, method, by, which, the, meaning, was, originally, depicted, phonographs, that, include, a, phonetic, component, and, loangraphs, encompassing, existing, characters, that, have, been, borrowed, to, write, other, words, qiu, also, acknowledges, the, existence, of, character, classes, that, fall, outside, of, these, principles, such, as, pure, signs, most, of, the, oldest, characters, are, pictographs, xi, ngx, ng, representational, pictures, of, physical, objects, examples, include, sun, moon, and, tree, over, time, the, forms, of, pictographs, have, been, simplified, in, order, to, make, them, easier, to, write, as, a, result, modern, readers, generally, cannot, deduce, what, many, pictographs, were, originally, meant, to, resemble, without, knowing, the, context, of, their, origin, in, picture, writing, they, may, be, interpreted, instead, as, pure, signs, however, if, a, pictograph, s, use, in, compounds, still, reflects, its, original, meaning, as, with, in, clear, sky, it, can, still, be, analysed, as, a, semantic, component, pictographs, have, often, been, extended, from, their, original, meanings, to, take, on, additional, layers, of, metaphor, and, synecdoche, which, sometimes, displace, the, character, s, original, sense, when, this, process, results, in, excessive, ambiguity, between, distinct, senses, written, with, the, same, character, it, is, usually, resolved, by, new, compounds, being, derived, to, represent, particular, senses, indicatives, zh, sh, also, called, simple, ideographs, or, self, explanatory, characters, are, visual, representations, of, abstract, concepts, that, lack, any, tangible, form, examples, include, up, and, down, these, characters, were, originally, written, as, dots, placed, above, and, below, a, line, and, later, evolved, into, their, present, forms, with, less, potential, for, graphical, ambiguity, in, context, more, complex, indicatives, include, convex, concave, and, flat, and, level, compound, ideographs, hu, y, also, called, logical, aggregates, associative, idea, characters, or, syssemantographs, combine, other, characters, to, convey, a, new, synthetic, meaning, a, canonical, example, is, bright, interpreted, as, the, juxtaposition, of, the, two, brightest, objects, in, the, sky, sun, and, moon, together, expressing, their, shared, quality, of, brightness, other, examples, include, rest, composed, of, pictographs, man, and, tree, and, good, composed, of, woman, and, child, many, traditional, examples, of, compound, ideographs, are, now, believed, to, have, actually, originated, as, phono, semantic, compounds, made, obscure, by, subsequent, changes, in, pronunciation, for, example, the, shuowen, jiezi, describes, trust, as, an, ideographic, compound, of, man, and, speech, but, modern, analyses, instead, identify, it, as, a, phono, semantic, compound, though, with, disagreement, as, to, which, component, is, phonetic, peter, a, boodberg, and, william, g, boltz, go, so, far, as, to, deny, that, any, compound, ideographs, were, devised, in, antiquity, maintaining, that, secondary, readings, that, are, now, lost, are, responsible, for, the, apparent, absence, of, phonetic, indicators, but, their, arguments, have, been, rejected, by, other, scholars, phono, semantic, compounds, x, ngsh, ng, are, composed, of, at, least, one, semantic, component, and, one, phonetic, component, they, may, be, formed, by, one, of, several, methods, often, by, adding, a, phonetic, component, to, disambiguate, a, loangraph, or, by, adding, a, semantic, component, to, represent, a, specific, extension, of, a, character, s, meaning, examples, of, phono, semantic, compounds, include, h, river, h, lake, li, stream, ch, ng, surge, and, hu, slippery, each, of, these, characters, have, three, short, strokes, on, their, left, hand, side, a, simplified, combining, form, of, water, this, component, serves, a, semantic, function, in, each, example, indicating, the, character, has, some, meaning, related, to, water, the, remainder, of, each, character, is, its, phonetic, component, h, is, pronounced, identically, to, h, in, standard, chinese, h, is, pronounced, similarly, to, k, and, ch, ng, is, pronounced, similarly, to, zh, ng, the, phonetic, components, of, most, compounds, may, only, provide, an, approximate, pronunciation, even, before, subsequent, sound, shifts, in, the, spoken, language, some, characters, may, only, have, the, same, initial, or, final, sound, of, a, syllable, in, common, with, phonetic, components, a, phonetic, series, comprises, all, the, characters, created, using, the, same, phonetic, component, which, may, have, diverged, significantly, in, their, pronunciations, over, time, for, example, ch, caa4, tea, and, t, tou4, route, are, part, of, the, phonetic, series, of, characters, using, y, jyu4, a, literary, first, person, pronoun, the, old, chinese, pronunciations, of, these, characters, were, similar, but, the, phonetic, component, no, longer, serves, as, a, useful, hint, for, their, pronunciation, due, to, subsequent, sound, shifts, the, phenomenon, of, existing, characters, being, adapted, to, write, other, words, with, similar, pronunciations, was, necessary, in, the, initial, development, of, chinese, writing, and, has, remained, common, throughout, its, subsequent, history, some, loangraphs, ji, ji, borrowing, are, introduced, to, represent, words, previously, lacking, another, written, form, this, is, often, the, case, with, abstract, grammatical, particles, such, as, and, the, process, of, characters, being, borrowed, as, loangraphs, should, not, be, conflated, with, the, distinct, process, of, semantic, extension, where, a, word, acquires, additional, senses, which, often, remain, written, with, the, same, character, as, both, processes, often, result, in, a, single, character, form, being, used, to, write, several, distinct, meanings, loangraphs, are, often, misidentified, as, being, the, result, of, semantic, extension, and, vice, versa, loangraphs, are, also, used, to, write, words, borrowed, from, other, languages, such, as, the, buddhist, terminology, introduced, to, china, in, antiquity, as, well, as, contemporary, non, chinese, words, and, names, for, example, each, character, in, the, name, ji, n, d, canada, is, often, used, as, a, loangraph, for, its, respective, syllable, however, the, barrier, between, a, character, s, pronunciation, and, meaning, is, never, total, when, transcribing, into, chinese, loangraphs, are, often, chosen, deliberately, as, to, create, certain, connotations, this, is, regularly, done, with, corporate, brand, names, for, example, coca, cola, s, chinese, name, is, k, k, u, k, l, delicious, enjoyable, some, characters, and, components, are, pure, signs, whose, meaning, merely, derives, from, their, having, a, fixed, and, distinct, form, basic, examples, of, pure, signs, are, found, with, the, numerals, beyond, four, e, g, five, and, eight, whose, forms, do, not, give, visual, hints, to, the, quantities, they, represent, the, shuowen, jiezi, is, a, character, dictionary, authored, c, 100, ce, by, the, scholar, xu, shen, c, 58, c, 148, ce, in, its, postface, xu, analyses, what, he, sees, as, all, the, methods, by, which, characters, are, created, later, authors, iterated, upon, xu, s, analysis, developing, a, categorisation, scheme, known, as, the, six, writings, li, sh, which, identifies, every, character, with, one, of, six, categories, that, had, previously, been, mentioned, in, the, shuowen, jiezi, for, nearly, two, millennia, this, scheme, was, the, primary, framework, for, character, analysis, used, throughout, the, sinosphere, xu, based, most, of, his, analysis, on, examples, of, qin, seal, script, that, were, written, down, several, centuries, before, his, time, these, were, usually, the, oldest, specimens, available, to, him, though, he, stated, he, was, aware, of, the, existence, of, even, older, forms, the, first, five, categories, are, pictographs, indicatives, compound, ideographs, phono, semantic, compounds, and, loangraphs, the, sixth, category, is, given, by, xu, as, zhu, nzh, reversed, and, refocused, however, its, definition, is, unclear, and, it, is, generally, disregarded, by, modern, scholars, modern, scholars, agree, that, the, theory, presented, in, the, shuowen, jiezi, is, problematic, failing, to, fully, capture, the, nature, of, chinese, writing, both, in, the, present, as, well, as, at, the, time, xu, was, writing, traditional, chinese, lexicography, as, embodied, in, the, shuowen, jiezi, has, suggested, implausible, etymologies, for, some, characters, moreover, several, categories, are, considered, to, be, ill, defined, for, example, it, is, unclear, whether, characters, like, large, should, be, classified, as, pictographs, or, indicatives, however, awareness, of, the, six, writings, model, has, remained, a, common, component, of, character, literacy, and, often, serves, as, a, tool, for, students, memorising, characters, the, broadest, trend, in, the, evolution, of, chinese, characters, over, their, history, has, been, simplification, both, in, graphical, shape, z, x, ng, the, external, appearances, of, individual, graphs, and, in, graphical, form, z, t, overall, changes, in, the, distinguishing, features, of, graphic, shape, and, calligraphic, style, in, most, cases, refer, to, rather, obvious, and, rather, substantial, changes, the, traditional, notion, of, an, orderly, procession, of, script, styles, each, suddenly, appearing, and, displacing, the, one, previous, has, been, disproven, by, later, scholarship, and, archaeological, work, instead, scripts, evolved, gradually, with, several, coexisting, in, a, given, area, several, of, the, chinese, classics, indicate, that, knotted, cords, were, used, to, keep, records, prior, to, the, invention, of, writing, works, that, reference, the, practice, include, chapter, 80, of, the, tao, te, ching, and, the, xici, ii, commentary, to, the, i, ching, according, to, one, tradition, chinese, characters, were, invented, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, by, cangjie, a, scribe, of, the, legendary, yellow, emperor, cangjie, is, said, to, have, invented, symbols, called, z, due, to, his, frustration, with, the, limitations, of, knotting, taking, inspiration, from, his, study, of, the, tracks, of, animals, landscapes, and, the, stars, in, the, sky, on, the, day, that, these, first, characters, were, created, grain, rained, down, from, the, sky, that, night, the, people, heard, the, wailing, of, ghosts, and, demons, lamenting, that, humans, could, no, longer, be, cheated, collections, of, graphs, and, pictures, have, been, discovered, at, the, sites, of, several, neolithic, settlements, throughout, the, yellow, river, valley, including, jiahu, c, 6500, bce, dadiwan, and, damaidi, 6th, millennium, bce, and, banpo, 5th, millennium, bce, symbols, at, each, site, were, inscribed, or, drawn, onto, artifacts, appearing, one, at, a, time, and, without, indicating, any, greater, context, qiu, concludes, we, simply, possess, no, basis, for, saying, that, they, were, already, being, used, to, record, language, a, historical, connection, with, the, symbols, used, by, the, late, neolithic, dawenkou, culture, c, 4300, c, 2600, bce, in, shandong, has, been, deemed, possible, by, palaeographers, with, qiu, concluding, that, they, cannot, be, definitively, treated, as, primitive, writing, nevertheless, they, are, symbols, which, resemble, most, the, ancient, pictographic, script, discovered, thus, far, in, china, they, undoubtedly, can, be, viewed, as, the, forerunners, of, primitive, writing, the, oldest, attested, chinese, writing, comprises, a, body, of, inscriptions, produced, during, the, late, shang, period, c, 1250, 1050, bce, with, the, very, earliest, examples, from, the, reign, of, wu, ding, dated, between, 1250, and, 1200, bce, many, of, these, inscriptions, were, made, on, oracle, bones, usually, either, ox, scapulae, or, turtle, plastrons, and, recorded, official, divinations, carried, out, by, the, shang, royal, house, contemporaneous, inscriptions, in, a, related, but, distinct, style, were, also, made, on, ritual, bronze, vessels, this, oracle, bone, script, ji, g, w, n, was, first, documented, in, 1899, after, specimens, were, discovered, being, sold, as, dragon, bones, for, medicinal, purposes, with, the, symbols, carved, into, them, identified, as, early, character, forms, by, 1928, the, source, of, the, bones, had, been, traced, to, a, village, near, anyang, in, henan, discovered, to, be, the, site, of, yin, the, final, shang, capital, which, was, excavated, by, a, team, led, by, li, ji, 1896, 1979, from, the, academia, sinica, between, 1928, and, 1937, to, date, over, 150, 000, oracle, bone, fragments, have, been, found, oracle, bone, inscriptions, recorded, divinations, undertaken, to, communicate, with, the, spirits, of, royal, ancestors, the, inscriptions, range, from, a, few, characters, in, length, at, their, shortest, to, several, dozen, at, their, longest, the, shang, king, would, communicate, with, his, ancestors, by, means, of, scapulimancy, inquiring, about, subjects, such, as, the, royal, family, military, success, and, the, weather, inscriptions, were, made, in, the, divination, material, itself, before, and, after, it, had, been, cracked, by, exposure, to, heat, they, generally, include, a, record, of, the, questions, posed, as, well, as, the, answers, as, interpreted, in, the, cracks, a, minority, of, bones, feature, characters, that, were, inked, with, a, brush, before, their, strokes, were, incised, the, evidence, of, this, also, shows, that, the, conventional, stroke, orders, used, by, later, calligraphers, had, already, been, established, for, many, characters, by, this, point, oracle, bone, script, is, the, direct, ancestor, of, later, forms, of, written, chinese, the, oldest, known, inscriptions, already, represent, a, well, developed, writing, system, which, suggests, an, initial, emergence, predating, the, late, second, millennium, bce, although, written, chinese, is, first, attested, in, official, divinations, it, is, widely, believed, that, writing, was, also, used, for, other, purposes, during, the, shang, but, that, the, media, used, in, other, contexts, likely, bamboo, and, wooden, slips, were, less, durable, than, bronzes, or, oracle, bones, and, have, not, been, preserved, as, early, as, the, shang, the, oracle, bone, script, existed, as, a, simplified, form, alongside, another, that, was, used, in, bamboo, books, in, addition, to, elaborate, pictorial, forms, often, used, in, clan, emblems, these, other, forms, have, been, preserved, in, what, is, called, bronze, script, j, nw, n, where, inscriptions, were, made, using, a, stylus, in, a, clay, mould, which, was, then, used, to, cast, ritual, bronzes, these, differences, in, technique, generally, resulted, in, character, forms, that, were, less, angular, in, appearance, than, their, oracle, bone, script, counterparts, study, of, these, bronze, inscriptions, has, revealed, that, the, mainstream, script, underwent, slow, gradual, evolution, during, the, late, shang, which, continued, during, the, zhou, dynasty, c, 1046, 256, bce, until, assuming, the, form, now, known, as, small, seal, script, xi, ozhu, n, within, the, zhou, state, of, qin, other, scripts, in, use, during, the, late, zhou, include, the, bird, worm, seal, script, ni, och, ngsh, as, well, as, the, regional, forms, used, in, non, qin, states, examples, of, these, styles, were, preserved, as, variants, in, the, shuowen, jiezi, historically, zhou, forms, were, collectively, referred, to, as, large, seal, script, d, zhu, n, a, term, which, has, fallen, out, of, favour, due, to, its, lack, of, precision, following, qin, s, conquest, of, the, other, chinese, states, that, culminated, in, the, founding, of, the, imperial, qin, dynasty, in, 221, bce, the, qin, small, seal, script, was, standardised, for, use, throughout, the, entire, country, under, the, direction, of, chancellor, li, si, c, 280, 208, bce, it, was, traditionally, believed, that, qin, scribes, only, used, small, seal, script, and, the, later, clerical, script, was, a, sudden, invention, during, the, early, han, however, more, than, one, script, was, used, by, qin, scribes, a, rectilinear, vulgar, style, had, also, been, in, use, in, qin, for, centuries, prior, to, the, wars, of, unification, the, popularity, of, this, form, grew, as, writing, became, more, widespread, by, the, warring, states, period, c, 475, 221, bce, an, immature, form, of, clerical, script, l, sh, had, emerged, based, on, the, vulgar, form, developed, within, qin, often, called, early, clerical, or, proto, clerical, the, proto, clerical, script, evolved, gradually, by, the, han, dynasty, 202, bce, 220, ce, it, had, arrived, at, a, mature, form, also, called, b, f, n, bamboo, slips, discovered, during, the, late, 20th, century, point, to, this, maturation, being, completed, during, the, reign, of, emperor, wu, of, han, r, 141, 87, bce, this, process, called, libian, involved, character, forms, being, mutated, and, simplified, with, many, components, being, consolidated, substituted, or, omitted, in, turn, the, components, themselves, were, regularised, to, use, fewer, straighter, and, more, well, defined, strokes, the, resulting, clerical, forms, largely, lacked, any, of, the, pictorial, qualities, that, remained, in, seal, script, around, the, midpoint, of, the, eastern, han, 25, 220, ce, a, simplified, and, easier, form, of, clerical, script, appeared, which, qiu, terms, neo, clerical, x, nl, t, by, the, end, of, the, han, this, had, become, the, dominant, script, used, by, scribes, though, clerical, script, remained, in, use, for, formal, works, such, as, engraved, stelae, qiu, describes, neo, clerical, as, a, transitional, form, between, clerical, and, regular, script, which, remained, in, use, through, the, three, kingdoms, period, 220, 280, ce, and, beyond, cursive, script, c, osh, was, in, use, as, early, as, 24, bce, synthesising, elements, of, the, vulgar, writing, that, had, originated, in, qin, with, flowing, cursive, brushwork, by, the, jin, dynasty, 266, 420, the, han, cursive, style, became, known, as, zh, ngc, o, orderly, cursive, sometimes, known, in, english, as, clerical, cursive, ancient, cursive, or, draft, cursive, some, attribute, this, name, to, the, fact, that, the, style, was, considered, more, orderly, than, a, later, form, referred, to, as, j, nc, o, modern, cursive, which, had, first, emerged, during, the, jin, and, was, influenced, by, semi, cursive, and, regular, script, this, later, form, was, exemplified, by, the, work, of, figures, like, wang, xizhi, 303, 361, who, is, often, regarded, as, the, most, important, calligrapher, in, chinese, history, an, early, form, of, semi, cursive, script, x, ngsh, running, script, can, be, identified, during, the, late, han, with, its, development, stemming, from, a, cursive, form, of, neo, clerical, script, liu, desheng, c, 147, 188, ce, is, traditionally, recognised, as, the, inventor, of, the, semi, cursive, style, though, accreditations, of, this, kind, often, indicate, a, given, style, s, early, masters, rather, than, its, earliest, practitioners, later, analysis, has, suggested, popular, origins, for, semi, cursive, as, opposed, to, it, being, an, invention, of, liu, it, can, be, characterised, partly, as, the, result, of, clerical, forms, being, written, more, quickly, without, formal, rules, of, technique, or, composition, what, would, be, discrete, strokes, in, clerical, script, frequently, flow, together, instead, the, semi, cursive, style, is, commonly, adopted, in, contemporary, handwriting, regular, script, k, ish, based, on, clerical, and, semi, cursive, forms, is, the, predominant, form, in, which, characters, are, written, and, printed, its, innovations, have, traditionally, been, credited, to, the, calligrapher, zhong, yao, c, 151, 230, who, was, living, in, the, state, of, cao, wei, 220, 266, he, is, often, called, the, father, of, regular, script, the, earliest, surviving, writing, in, regular, script, comprises, copies, of, zhong, yao, s, work, including, at, least, one, copy, by, wang, xizhi, characteristics, of, regular, script, include, the, pause, d, n, technique, used, to, end, horizontal, strokes, as, well, as, heavy, tails, on, diagonal, strokes, made, going, down, and, to, the, right, it, developed, further, during, the, eastern, jin, 317, 420, in, the, hands, of, wang, xizhi, and, his, son, wang, xianzhi, 344, 386, however, most, jin, era, writers, continued, to, use, neo, clerical, and, semi, cursive, styles, in, their, daily, writing, it, was, not, until, the, northern, and, southern, period, 420, 589, that, regular, script, became, the, predominant, form, the, system, of, imperial, examinations, for, the, civil, service, established, during, the, sui, dynasty, 581, 618, required, test, takers, to, write, in, literary, chinese, using, regular, script, which, contributed, to, the, prevalence, of, both, throughout, later, chinese, history, each, character, of, a, text, is, written, within, a, uniform, square, allotted, for, it, as, part, of, the, evolution, from, seal, script, into, clerical, script, character, components, became, regularised, as, discrete, series, of, strokes, b, hu, strokes, can, be, considered, both, the, basic, unit, of, handwriting, as, well, as, the, writing, system, s, basic, unit, of, graphemic, organisation, in, clerical, and, regular, script, individual, strokes, traditionally, belong, to, one, of, eight, categories, according, to, their, technique, and, graphemic, function, in, what, is, known, as, the, eight, principles, of, yong, calligraphers, practice, their, technique, using, the, character, y, ng, eternity, which, can, be, written, with, one, stroke, of, each, type, in, ordinary, writing, is, now, written, with, five, strokes, instead, of, eight, and, a, system, of, five, basic, stroke, types, is, commonly, employed, in, analysis, with, certain, compound, strokes, treated, as, sequences, of, basic, strokes, made, in, a, single, motion, characters, are, constructed, according, to, predictable, visual, patterns, some, components, have, distinct, combining, forms, when, occupying, specific, positions, within, a, character, for, example, the, knife, component, appears, as, on, the, right, side, of, characters, but, as, at, the, top, of, characters, the, order, in, which, components, are, drawn, within, a, character, is, fixed, the, order, in, which, the, strokes, of, a, component, are, drawn, is, also, largely, fixed, but, may, vary, according, to, several, different, standards, this, is, summed, up, in, practice, with, a, few, rules, of, thumb, including, that, characters, are, generally, assembled, from, left, to, right, then, from, top, to, bottom, with, enclosing, components, started, before, then, closed, after, the, components, they, enclose, for, example, is, drawn, in, the, following, order, over, a, character, s, history, variant, character, forms, y, t, z, emerge, via, several, processes, variant, forms, have, distinct, structures, but, represent, the, same, morpheme, as, such, they, can, be, considered, instances, of, the, same, underlying, character, this, is, comparable, to, visually, distinct, double, storey, a, and, single, storey, forms, both, representing, the, latin, letter, a, variants, also, emerge, for, aesthetic, reasons, to, make, handwriting, easier, or, to, correct, what, the, writer, perceives, to, be, errors, in, a, character, s, form, individual, components, may, be, replaced, with, visually, phonetically, or, semantically, similar, alternatives, the, boundary, between, character, structure, and, style, and, thus, whether, forms, represent, different, characters, or, are, merely, variants, of, the, same, character, is, often, non, trivial, or, unclear, for, example, prior, to, the, qin, dynasty, the, character, meaning, bright, was, written, as, either, or, with, either, sun, or, window, on, the, left, and, moon, on, the, right, as, part, of, the, qin, programme, to, standardise, small, seal, script, across, china, the, form, was, promoted, some, scribes, ignored, this, and, continued, to, write, the, character, as, however, the, increased, usage, of, was, followed, by, the, proliferation, of, a, third, variant, with, eye, on, the, left, likely, derived, as, a, contraction, of, ultimately, became, the, character, s, standard, form, from, the, earliest, inscriptions, until, the, 20th, century, texts, were, generally, laid, out, vertically, with, characters, written, from, top, to, bottom, in, columns, arranged, from, right, to, left, word, boundaries, are, generally, not, indicated, with, spaces, a, horizontal, writing, direction, with, characters, written, from, left, to, right, in, rows, arranged, from, top, to, bottom, only, became, predominant, in, the, sinosphere, during, the, 20th, century, as, a, result, of, western, influence, many, publications, outside, mainland, china, continue, to, use, the, traditional, vertical, writing, direction, western, influence, also, resulted, in, the, generalised, use, of, punctuation, being, widely, adopted, in, print, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, prior, to, this, the, context, of, a, passage, was, considered, adequate, to, guide, readers, this, was, enabled, by, characters, being, easier, than, alphabets, to, read, when, written, scriptio, continua, due, to, their, more, discretised, shapes, the, earliest, attested, chinese, characters, were, carved, into, bone, or, marked, using, a, stylus, in, clay, moulds, used, to, cast, ritual, bronzes, characters, have, also, been, incised, into, stone, or, written, in, ink, onto, slips, of, silk, wood, and, bamboo, the, invention, of, paper, for, use, as, a, writing, medium, occurred, during, the, 1st, century, ce, and, is, traditionally, credited, to, cai, lun, d, 121, ce, there, are, numerous, styles, or, scripts, sh, in, which, characters, can, be, written, including, the, historical, forms, like, seal, script, and, clerical, script, most, styles, used, throughout, the, sinosphere, originated, within, china, though, they, may, display, regional, variation, styles, that, have, been, created, outside, of, china, tend, to, remain, localised, in, their, use, these, include, the, japanese, edomoji, and, vietnamese, l, nh, th, scripts, calligraphy, was, traditionally, one, of, the, four, arts, to, be, mastered, by, chinese, scholars, considered, to, be, an, artful, means, of, expressing, thoughts, and, teachings, chinese, calligraphy, typically, makes, use, of, an, ink, brush, to, write, characters, strict, regularity, is, not, required, and, character, forms, may, be, accentuated, to, evoke, a, variety, of, aesthetic, effects, traditional, ideals, of, calligraphic, beauty, often, tie, into, broader, philosophical, concepts, native, to, east, asia, for, example, aesthetics, can, be, conceptualised, using, the, framework, of, yin, and, yang, where, the, extremes, of, any, number, of, mutually, reinforcing, dualities, are, balanced, by, the, calligrapher, such, as, the, duality, between, strokes, made, quickly, or, slowly, between, applying, ink, heavily, or, lightly, between, characters, written, with, symmetrical, or, asymmetrical, forms, and, between, characters, representing, concrete, or, abstract, concepts, woodblock, printing, was, invented, in, china, between, the, 6th, and, 9th, centuries, followed, by, the, invention, of, moveable, type, by, bi, sheng, 972, 1051, during, the, 11th, century, the, increasing, use, of, print, during, the, ming, 1368, 1644, and, qing, dynasties, 1644, 1912, led, to, considerable, standardisation, in, character, forms, which, prefigured, later, script, reforms, during, the, 20th, century, this, print, orthography, exemplified, by, the, 1716, kangxi, dictionary, was, later, dubbed, the, jiu, zixing, old, character, shapes, printed, chinese, characters, may, use, different, typefaces, of, which, there, are, four, broad, classes, in, use, before, computers, became, ubiquitous, earlier, electro, mechanical, communications, devices, like, telegraphs, and, typewriters, were, originally, designed, for, use, with, alphabets, often, by, means, of, alphabetic, text, encodings, like, morse, code, and, ascii, adapting, these, technologies, for, use, with, a, writing, system, comprising, thousands, of, distinct, characters, was, non, trivial, chinese, characters, are, predominantly, input, on, computers, using, a, standard, keyboard, many, input, methods, imes, are, phonetic, where, typists, enter, characters, according, to, schemes, like, pinyin, or, bopomofo, for, mandarin, jyutping, for, cantonese, or, hepburn, for, japanese, for, example, hong, kong, could, be, input, as, xiang1gang3, using, pinyin, or, as, hoeng1gong2, using, jyutping, character, input, methods, may, also, be, based, on, form, using, the, shape, of, characters, and, existing, rules, of, handwriting, to, assign, unique, codes, to, each, character, potentially, increasing, the, speed, of, typing, popular, form, based, input, methods, include, wubi, on, the, mainland, and, cangjie, named, after, the, mythological, inventor, of, writing, in, taiwan, and, hong, kong, often, unnecessary, parts, are, omitted, from, the, encoding, according, to, predictable, rules, for, example, border, is, encoded, using, the, cangjie, method, as, ngmwm, which, corresponds, to, the, components, contextual, constraints, may, be, used, to, improve, candidate, character, selection, when, ignoring, tones, and, are, both, transcribed, as, daxue, the, system, may, prioritize, which, candidate, should, appear, first, based, on, the, surrounding, context, while, special, text, encodings, for, chinese, characters, were, introduced, prior, to, its, popularisation, the, unicode, standard, is, the, predominant, text, encoding, worldwide, according, to, the, philosophy, of, the, unicode, consortium, each, distinct, graph, is, assigned, a, number, in, the, standard, but, specifying, its, appearance, or, the, particular,

total, of, 98, 682, chinese, characters, writing, first, emerged, during, the, historical, stage, of, the, chinese, language, known, as, old, chinese, most, characters, correspond, to, morphemes, that, originally, functioned, as, stand, alone, old, chinese, words, classical, chinese, is, the, form, of, written, chinese, used, in, the, classic, works, of, chinese, literature, between, roughly, the, 5th, century, bce, and, the, 2nd, century, ce, this, form, of, the, language, was, imitated, by, later, authors, even, as, it, began, to, diverge, from, the, language, they, spoke, this, later, form, referred, to, as, literary, chinese, remained, the, predominant, written, language, in, china, until, the, 20th, century, its, use, in, the, sinosphere, was, loosely, analogous, to, that, of, latin, in, pre, modern, europe, while, it, was, not, static, over, time, literary, chinese, retained, many, properties, of, spoken, old, chinese, informed, by, the, local, spoken, vernaculars, texts, were, read, aloud, using, literary, and, colloquial, readings, that, varied, by, region, over, time, sound, mergers, created, ambiguities, in, vernacular, speech, as, more, words, became, homophonic, this, ambiguity, was, often, reduced, through, the, introduction, of, multi, syllable, compound, words, which, comprise, much, of, the, vocabulary, in, modern, varieties, of, chinese, over, time, use, of, literary, chinese, spread, to, neighbouring, countries, including, vietnam, korea, and, japan, alongside, other, aspects, of, chinese, culture, local, elites, adopted, writing, for, record, keeping, histories, and, official, communications, forming, what, is, sometimes, called, the, sinosphere, excepting, hypotheses, by, some, linguists, of, the, latter, two, sharing, a, common, ancestor, chinese, vietnamese, korean, and, japanese, each, belong, to, different, language, families, and, tend, to, function, differently, from, one, another, reading, systems, were, devised, to, enable, non, chinese, speakers, to, interpret, literary, chinese, texts, in, terms, of, their, native, language, a, phenomenon, that, has, been, variously, described, as, either, a, form, of, diglossia, as, reading, by, gloss, or, as, a, process, of, translation, into, and, out, of, chinese, compared, to, other, traditions, that, wrote, using, alphabets, or, syllabaries, the, literary, culture, that, developed, in, this, context, was, less, directly, tied, to, a, specific, spoken, language, this, is, exemplified, by, the, cross, linguistic, phenomenon, of, brushtalk, where, mutual, literacy, allowed, speakers, of, different, languages, to, engage, in, face, to, face, conversations, following, the, introduction, of, literary, chinese, characters, were, later, adapted, to, write, many, non, chinese, languages, spoken, throughout, the, sinosphere, these, new, writing, systems, used, characters, to, write, both, native, vocabulary, and, the, numerous, loanwords, each, language, had, borrowed, from, chinese, collectively, referred, to, as, sino, xenic, vocabulary, characters, may, have, native, readings, sino, xenic, readings, or, both, comparison, of, sino, xenic, vocabulary, across, the, sinosphere, has, been, useful, in, the, reconstruction, of, middle, chinese, phonology, literary, chinese, was, used, in, vietnam, during, the, millennium, of, chinese, rule, that, began, in, 111, bce, by, the, 15th, century, a, system, that, adapted, characters, to, write, vietnamese, called, ch, n, m, had, fully, matured, the, 2nd, century, bce, is, the, earliest, possible, period, for, the, introduction, of, writing, to, korea, the, oldest, surviving, manuscripts, in, the, country, date, to, the, early, 5th, century, ce, also, during, the, 5th, century, writing, spread, from, korea, to, japan, characters, were, being, used, to, write, both, korean, and, japanese, by, the, 6th, century, by, the, late, 20th, century, characters, had, largely, been, replaced, with, alphabets, designed, to, write, vietnamese, and, korean, this, leaves, japanese, as, the, only, major, non, sinitic, language, typically, written, using, chinese, characters, words, in, classical, chinese, were, generally, a, single, character, in, length, an, estimated, 25, 30, of, the, vocabulary, used, in, classical, chinese, texts, consists, of, two, character, words, over, time, the, introduction, of, multi, syllable, vocabulary, into, vernacular, varieties, of, chinese, was, encouraged, by, phonetic, shifts, that, increased, the, number, of, homophones, the, most, common, process, of, chinese, word, formation, after, the, classical, period, has, been, to, create, compounds, of, existing, words, words, have, also, been, created, by, appending, affixes, to, words, by, reduplication, and, by, borrowing, words, from, other, languages, while, multi, syllable, words, are, generally, written, with, one, character, per, syllable, abbreviations, are, occasionally, used, for, example, rsh, twenty, may, be, written, as, the, contracted, form, sometimes, different, morphemes, come, to, be, represented, by, characters, with, identical, shapes, for, example, may, represent, either, road, x, ng, or, the, extended, sense, of, row, h, ng, these, morphemes, are, ultimately, cognates, that, diverged, in, pronunciation, but, remained, written, with, the, same, character, however, qiu, reserves, the, term, homograph, to, describe, identically, shaped, characters, with, different, meanings, that, emerge, via, processes, other, than, semantic, extension, an, example, homograph, is, which, originally, meant, weight, used, at, a, steelyard, tu, in, the, 20th, century, this, character, was, created, again, with, the, meaning, thallium, t, both, of, these, characters, are, phono, semantic, compounds, with, gold, as, the, semantic, component, and, as, the, phonetic, component, but, the, words, represented, by, each, are, not, related, there, are, a, number, of, dialect, characters, f, ngy, nz, that, are, not, used, in, standard, written, vernacular, chinese, but, reflect, the, vocabulary, of, other, spoken, varieties, the, most, complete, example, of, an, orthography, based, on, a, variety, other, than, standard, chinese, is, written, cantonese, a, common, cantonese, character, is, mou5, to, not, have, derived, by, removing, two, strokes, from, jau5, to, have, it, is, common, to, use, standard, characters, to, transcribe, previously, unwritten, words, in, chinese, dialects, when, obvious, cognates, exist, when, no, obvious, cognate, exists, due, to, factors, like, irregular, sound, changes, semantic, drift, or, an, origin, in, a, non, chinese, language, characters, are, often, borrowed, or, invented, to, transcribe, the, word, either, ad, hoc, or, according, to, existing, principles, these, new, characters, are, generally, phono, semantic, compounds, in, japanese, chinese, characters, are, referred, to, as, kanji, beginning, in, the, nara, period, 710, 794, readers, and, writers, of, kanbun, the, japanese, term, for, literary, chinese, writing, began, employing, a, system, of, reading, techniques, and, annotations, called, kundoku, when, reading, japanese, speakers, would, adapt, the, syntax, and, vocabulary, of, literary, chinese, texts, to, reflect, their, japanese, language, equivalents, writing, essentially, involved, the, inverse, of, this, process, and, resulted, in, ordinary, literary, chinese, when, adapted, to, write, japanese, characters, were, used, to, represent, both, sino, japanese, vocabulary, loaned, from, chinese, as, well, as, the, corresponding, native, synonyms, most, kanji, were, subject, to, both, borrowing, processes, and, as, a, result, have, both, sino, japanese, and, native, readings, known, as, on, yomi, and, kun, yomi, respectively, moreover, kanji, may, have, multiple, readings, of, either, kind, distinct, classes, of, on, yomi, were, borrowed, into, japanese, at, different, points, in, time, from, different, varieties, of, chinese, the, japanese, writing, system, is, a, mixed, script, and, has, also, incorporated, syllabaries, called, kana, to, represent, phonetic, units, called, moras, rather, than, morphemes, prior, to, the, meiji, era, 1868, 1912, writers, used, certain, kanji, to, represent, their, sound, values, instead, in, a, system, known, as, man, y, gana, starting, in, the, 9th, century, specific, man, y, gana, were, graphically, simplified, to, create, two, distinct, syllabaries, called, hiragana, and, katakana, which, slowly, replaced, the, earlier, convention, modern, japanese, retains, the, use, of, kanji, to, represent, most, word, stems, while, kana, syllabograms, are, generally, used, for, grammatical, affixes, particles, and, loanwords, the, forms, of, hiragana, and, katakana, are, visually, distinct, from, one, another, owing, in, large, part, to, different, methods, of, simplification, katakana, were, derived, from, smaller, components, of, each, man, y, gana, while, hiragana, were, derived, from, the, cursive, forms, of, man, y, gana, in, their, entirety, in, addition, the, hiragana, and, katakana, for, some, moras, were, derived, from, different, man, y, gana, characters, invented, for, japanese, language, use, are, called, kokuji, the, methods, employed, to, create, kokuji, are, equivalent, to, those, used, by, chinese, original, characters, though, most, are, ideographic, compounds, for, example, t, ge, mountain, pass, is, a, compound, kokuji, composed, of, mountain, above, and, below, while, characters, used, to, write, chinese, are, monosyllabic, many, kanji, have, multi, syllable, readings, for, example, the, kanji, has, a, native, kun, yomi, reading, of, katana, in, different, contexts, it, can, also, be, read, with, the, on, yomi, reading, t, such, as, in, the, chinese, loanword, nihont, japanese, sword, with, a, pronunciation, corresponding, to, that, in, chinese, at, the, time, of, borrowing, prior, to, the, universal, adoption, of, katakana, loanwords, were, typically, written, with, unrelated, kanji, with, on, yomi, readings, matching, the, syllables, in, the, loanword, these, spellings, are, called, ateji, for, example, amerika, was, the, ateji, spelling, of, america, now, rendered, as, as, opposed, to, man, y, gana, used, solely, for, their, pronunciation, ateji, still, corresponded, to, specific, japanese, words, some, are, still, in, use, the, official, list, of, j, y, kanji, includes, 106, ateji, readings, in, korean, chinese, characters, are, known, as, hanja, literary, chinese, may, have, been, written, in, korea, as, early, as, the, 2nd, century, bce, during, the, three, kingdoms, period, 57, bce, 668, ce, characters, were, also, used, to, write, idu, a, form, of, korean, language, literature, that, mostly, made, use, of, sino, korean, vocabulary, during, the, goryeo, period, 918, 1392, korean, writers, developed, a, system, of, phonetic, annotations, for, literary, chinese, called, gugyeol, comparable, to, kundoku, in, japan, though, it, only, entered, widespread, use, during, the, later, joseon, period, 1392, 1897, while, the, hangul, alphabet, was, invented, by, the, joseon, king, sejong, r, 1418, 1450, in, 1443, it, was, not, adopted, by, the, korean, literati, and, was, relegated, to, use, in, glosses, for, literary, chinese, texts, until, the, late, 19th, century, much, of, the, korean, lexicon, consists, of, chinese, loanwords, especially, technical, and, academic, vocabulary, while, hanja, were, usually, only, used, to, write, this, sino, korean, vocabulary, there, is, evidence, that, vernacular, readings, were, sometimes, used, compared, to, the, other, written, vernaculars, very, few, characters, were, invented, to, write, korean, words, these, are, called, gukja, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, korean, was, written, either, using, a, mixed, script, of, hangul, and, hanja, or, only, using, hangul, following, the, end, of, the, empire, of, japan, s, occupation, of, korea, in, 1945, the, total, replacement, of, hanja, with, hangul, was, advocated, throughout, the, country, as, part, of, a, broader, purification, movement, of, the, national, language, and, culture, however, due, to, the, lack, of, tones, in, spoken, korean, there, are, many, sino, korean, words, that, are, homophones, with, identical, hangul, spellings, for, example, the, phonetic, dictionary, entry, for, gisa, yields, more, than, 30, different, entries, this, ambiguity, had, historically, been, resolved, by, also, including, the, associated, hanja, while, still, sometimes, used, for, sino, korean, vocabulary, it, is, much, rarer, for, native, korean, words, to, be, written, using, hanja, when, learning, new, characters, korean, students, are, instructed, to, associate, each, one, with, both, its, sino, korean, pronunciation, as,

all, formal, writing, in, vietnam, until, the, modern, era, having, first, acquired, official, status, in, 1010, literary, chinese, written, by, vietnamese, authors, is, first, attested, in, the, late, 10th, century, though, the, local, practice, of, writing, is, likely, several, centuries, older, characters, used, to, write, vietnamese, called, ch, n, m, are, first, attested, in, an, inscription, dated, to, 1209, made, at, the, site, of, a, pagoda, a, mature, ch, n, m, script, had, likely, emerged, by, the, 13th, century, and, was, initially, used, to, record, vietnamese, folk, literature, some, ch, n, m, characters, are, phono, semantic, compounds, corresponding, to, spoken, vietnamese, syllables, another, technique, with, no, equivalent, in, china, created, ch, n, m, compounds, using, two, phonetic, components, this, was, done, because, vietnamese, phonology, included, consonant, clusters, not, found, in, chinese, and, were, thus, poorly, approximated, by, the, sound, values, of, borrowed, characters, compounds, used, components, with, two, distinct, consonant, sounds, to, specify, the, cluster, e, g, bl, ng, moon, was, created, as, a, compound, of, ba, and, l, ng, as, a, system, ch, n, m, was, highly, complex, and, the, literacy, rate, among, the, vietnamese, population, never, exceeded, 5, both, literary, chinese, and, ch, n, m, fell, out, of, use, during, the, french, colonial, period, and, were, gradually, replaced, by, the, latin, based, vietnamese, alphabet, following, the, end, of, colonial, rule, in, 1954, the, vietnamese, alphabet, has, been, sole, official, writing, system, in, vietnam, and, is, used, exclusively, in, vietnamese, language, media, several, minority, languages, of, south, and, southwest, china, have, been, written, with, scripts, using, both, borrowed, and, locally, created, characters, the, most, well, documented, of, these, is, the, sawndip, script, for, the, zhuang, languages, of, guangxi, while, little, is, known, about, its, early, development, a, tradition, of, vernacular, zhuang, writing, likely, first, emerged, during, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, modern, scholarship, on, sawndip, has, described, a, network, of, regional, writing, traditions, exhibiting, both, mutual, influence, and, characteristic, difference, with, one, another, like, vietnamese, some, invented, zhuang, characters, are, phonetic, phonetic, compounds, though, not, primarily, ones, intended, to, describe, consonant, clusters, despite, the, chinese, government, encouraging, its, replacement, with, a, latin, based, zhuang, alphabet, sawndip, remains, in, use, other, non, sinitic, languages, of, china, written, with, chinese, characters, include, miao, yao, bouyei, bai, and, hani, each, of, these, languages, are, now, written, with, latin, based, alphabets, in, official, contexts, between, the, 10th, and, 13th, centuries, dynasties, founded, by, non, han, peoples, in, northern, china, also, created, scripts, for, their, languages, that, were, inspired, by, chinese, characters, but, did, not, use, them, directly, these, included, the, khitan, large, script, khitan, small, script, tangut, script, and, jurchen, script, this, has, occurred, in, other, contexts, as, well, n, shu, was, a, script, used, by, yao, women, to, write, the, xiangnan, tuhua, language, and, bopomofo, zh, y, n, f, h, o, is, a, semi, syllabary, first, invented, in, 1907, to, represent, the, sounds, of, standard, chinese, both, use, forms, graphically, derived, from, chinese, characters, other, scripts, within, china, that, have, adapted, some, characters, but, are, otherwise, distinct, include, the, geba, syllabary, used, to, write, the, naxi, language, the, script, for, the, sui, language, the, script, for, the, yi, languages, and, the, syllabary, for, the, lisu, language, chinese, characters, have, also, been, repurposed, phonetically, to, transcribe, the, sounds, of, non, chinese, languages, for, example, the, only, manuscripts, of, the, 13th, century, secret, history, of, the, mongols, that, have, survived, from, the, medieval, era, use, characters, in, this, manner, to, write, the, mongolian, language, the, memorisation, of, thousands, of, different, characters, is, required, to, achieve, literacy, in, languages, written, with, them, in, contrast, to, the, relatively, small, inventory, of, graphemes, used, in, phonetic, writing, historically, character, literacy, was, often, acquired, via, chinese, primers, like, the, 6th, century, thousand, character, classic, and, 13th, century, three, character, classic, as, well, as, surname, dictionaries, like, the, song, era, hundred, family, surnames, studies, of, chinese, language, literacy, suggest, that, literate, individuals, generally, have, an, active, vocabulary, of, three, to, four, thousand, characters, for, specialists, in, fields, like, literature, or, history, this, figure, may, be, between, five, and, six, thousand, according, to, analyses, of, mainland, chinese, taiwanese, hong, kong, japanese, and, korean, sources, the, total, number, of, characters, in, the, modern, lexicon, is, around, 15, 000, dozens, of, schemes, have, been, devised, for, indexing, chinese, characters, and, arranging, them, in, dictionaries, though, relatively, few, have, achieved, widespread, use, characters, may, be, ordered, according, to, methods, based, on, their, meaning, visual, structure, or, pronunciation, the, erya, c, 3rd, century, bce, organised, the, chinese, lexicon, into, 16, semantic, categories, as, well, as, 3, describing, abstract, characters, such, as, grammatical, particles, the, shuowen, jiezi, c, 100, ce, introduced, what, would, ultimately, become, the, predominant, method, of, organisation, used, by, later, character, dictionaries, whereby, characters, are, grouped, according, to, certain, visually, prominent, components, called, radicals, b, sh, u, section, headers, the, shuowen, jiezi, used, a, system, of, 540, radicals, while, subsequent, dictionaries, have, generally, used, fewer, the, set, of, 214, kangxi, radicals, was, popularised, by, the, kangxi, dictionary, 1716, but, originally, appeared, in, the, earlier, zihui, 1615, character, dictionaries, have, historically, been, indexed, using, radical, and, stroke, sorting, where, characters, are, grouped, by, radical, and, sorted, within, each, group, by, stroke, number, some, modern, dictionaries, arrange, character, entries, alphabetically, according, to, their, pinyin, spelling, while, also, providing, a, traditional, radical, based, index, before, the, invention, of, romanisation, systems, for, chinese, the, pronunciation, of, characters, was, transmitted, via, rime, dictionaries, these, used, the, fanqie, reverse, cut, method, where, each, entry, lists, a, common, character, with, the, same, initial, sound, as, the, character, in, question, alongside, one, with, the, same, final, sound, using, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, neurolinguists, have, studied, the, brain, activity, associated, with, literacy, compared, to, phonetic, systems, reading, and, writing, with, characters, involves, additional, areas, of, the, brain, including, those, associated, with, visual, processing, while, the, level, of, memorisation, required, for, character, literacy, is, significant, identification, of, the, phonetic, and, semantic, components, in, compounds, which, constitute, the, vast, majority, of, characters, also, plays, a, key, role, in, reading, comprehension, the, ease, of, recognition, for, a, given, character, is, impacted, by, how, regular, the, positioning, of, its, components, is, as, well, as, how, reliable, its, phonetic, component, is, in, indicating, a, specific, pronunciation, moreover, due, to, the, high, level, of, homophony, in, chinese, languages, and, the, more, irregular, correspondences, between, writing, and, the, sounds, of, speech, it, has, been, suggested, that, knowledge, of, orthography, plays, a, greater, role, in, speech, recognition, for, literate, chinese, speakers, developmental, dyslexia, in, readers, of, character, based, languages, appears, to, involve, independent, visuospatial, and, phonological, disorders, co, occurring, this, seems, to, be, a, distinct, phenomenon, from, dyslexia, as, experienced, with, phonetic, orthographies, which, can, result, from, only, one, of, the, aforementioned, disorders, attempts, to, reform, and, standardise, the, use, of, characters, including, aspects, of, form, stroke, order, and, pronunciation, have, been, undertaken, by, states, throughout, history, thousands, of, simplified, characters, were, standardised, and, adopted, in, mainland, china, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, with, most, either, already, existing, as, common, variants, or, being, produced, via, the, systematic, simplification, of, their, components, after, world, war, ii, the, japanese, government, also, simplified, hundreds, of, character, forms, including, some, simplifications, distinct, from, those, adopted, in, china, orthodox, forms, that, have, not, undergone, simplification, are, referred, to, as, traditional, characters, across, chinese, speaking, polities, mainland, china, malaysia, and, singapore, use, simplified, characters, while, taiwan, hong, kong, and, macau, use, traditional, characters, in, general, chinese, and, japanese, readers, can, successfully, identify, characters, from, all, three, standards, prior, to, the, 20th, century, reforms, were, generally, conservative, and, sought, to, reduce, the, use, of, simplified, variants, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, an, increasing, number, of, intellectuals, in, china, began, to, see, both, the, chinese, writing, system, and, the, lack, of, a, national, spoken, dialect, as, serious, impediments, to, achieving, the, mass, literacy, and, mutual, intelligibility, required, for, the, country, s, successful, modernisation, many, began, advocating, for, the, replacement, of, literary, chinese, with, a, written, language, that, more, closely, reflected, speech, as, well, as, for, a, mass, simplification, of, character, forms, or, even, the, total, replacement, of, characters, with, an, alphabet, tailored, to, a, specific, spoken, variety, in, 1909, the, educator, and, linguist, lufei, kui, 1886, 1941, formally, proposed, the, adoption, of, simplified, characters, in, education, for, the, first, time, in, 1911, the, xinhai, revolution, toppled, the, qing, dynasty, and, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, the, republic, of, china, the, following, year, the, early, republican, era, 1912, 1949, was, characterised, by, growing, social, and, political, discontent, that, erupted, into, the, 1919, may, fourth, movement, catalysing, the, replacement, of, literary, chinese, with, written, vernacular, chinese, over, the, subsequent, decades, alongside, the, corresponding, spoken, variety, now, known, as, standard, chinese, this, written, vernacular, was, promoted, by, intellectuals, and, writers, such, as, lu, xun, 1881, 1936, and, hu, shih, 1891, 1962, it, was, based, on, the, beijing, dialect, of, mandarin, as, well, as, on, the, existing, body, of, vernacular, literature, authored, over, the, preceding, centuries, which, included, classic, novels, such, as, journey, to, the, west, c, 1592, and, dream, of, the, red, chamber, mid, 18th, century, at, this, time, character, simplification, and, phonetic, writing, were, being, discussed, within, both, the, ruling, kuomintang, kmt, party, as, well, as, the, chinese, communist, party, ccp, in, 1935, the, republican, government, published, the, first, official, list, of, simplified, characters, comprising, 324, forms, collated, by, peking, university, professor, qian, xuantong, 1887, 1939, however, strong, opposition, within, the, party, resulted, in, the, list, being, rescinded, in, 1936, the, project, of, script, reform, in, china, was, ultimately, inherited, by, the, communists, who, resumed, work, following, the, proclamation, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, in, 1949, in, 1951, premier, zhou, enlai, 1898, 1976, ordered, the, formation, of, a, script, reform, committee, with, subgroups, investigating, both, simplification, and, alphabetisation, the, simplification, subgroup, began, surveying, and, collating, simplified, forms, the, following, year, ultimately, publishing, a, draft, scheme, of, simplified, characters, and, components, in, 1956, in, 1958, zhou, enlai, announced, the, government, s, intent, to, focus, on, simplification, as, opposed, to, replacing, characters, with, hanyu, pinyin, which, had, been, introduced, earlier, that, year, the, 1956, scheme, was, largely, ratified, by, a, revised, list, of, 2235, characters, promulgated, in, 1964, the, majority, of, these, characters, were, drawn, from, conventional, abbreviations, or, ancient, forms, with, fewer, strokes, the, committee, also, sought, to, reduce, the, total, number, of, characters, in, use, by, merging, some, forms, together, for, example, cloud, was, written, as, in, oracle, bone, script, the, simpler, form, remained, in, use, as, a, loangraph, meaning, to, say, it, was, replaced, in, its, original, sense, of, cloud, with, a, form, that, added, a, semantic, rain, component, the, simplified, forms, of, these, two, characters, have, been, merged, into, a, second, round, of, simplified, characters, was, promulgated, in, 1977, but, was, poorly, received, by, the, public, and, quickly, fell, out, of, official, use, it, was, ultimately, formally, rescinded, in, 1986, the, second, round, simplifications, were, unpopular, in, large, part, because, most, of, the, forms, were, completely, new, in, contrast, to, the, familiar, variants, comprising, the, majority, of, the, first, round, with, the, rescission, of, the, second, round, work, toward, further, character, simplification, largely, came, to, an, end, the, chart, of, generally, utilised, characters, of, modern, chinese, was, published, in, 1988, and, included, 7000, simplified, and, unsimplified, characters, of, these, half, were, also, included, in, the, revised, list, of, commonly, used, characters, in, modern, chinese, which, specified, 2500, common, characters, and, 1000, less, common, characters, in, 2013, the, list, of, commonly, used, standard, chinese, characters, was, published, as, a, revision, of, the, 1988, lists, it, included, a, total, of, 8105, characters, after, world, war, ii, the, japanese, government, instituted, its, own, program, of, orthographic, reforms, some, characters, were, assigned, simplified, forms, called, shinjitai, the, older, forms, were, then, labelled, ky, jitai, inconsistent, use, of, different, variant, forms, was, discouraged, and, lists, of, characters, to, be, taught, to, students, at, each, grade, level, were, developed, the, first, of, these, was, the, 1850, character, t, y, kanji, list, published, in, 1946, later, replaced, by, the, 1945, character, j, y, kanji, list, in, 1981, in, 2010, the, j, y, kanji, were, expanded, to, include, a, total, of, 2136, characters, the, japanese, government, restricts, characters, that, may, be, used, in, names, to, the, j, y, kanji, plus, an, additional, list, of, 983, jinmeiy, kanji, whose, use, are, historically, prevalent, in, names, hanja, are, still, used, in, south, korea, though, not, to, the, extent, that, kanji, are, used, in, japan, in, general, there, is, a, trend, toward, the, exclusive, use, of, hangul, in, ordinary, contexts, characters, remain, in, use, in, place, names, newspapers, and, to, disambiguate, homophones,

having, vacillated, since, the, country, s, independence, some, support, the, total, abandonment, of, hanja, while, others, advocate, an, increase, in, use, to, levels, previously, seen, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, students, in, grades, 7, 12, are, presently, taught, with, a, principal, focus, on, simple, recognition, and, attaining, sufficient, literacy, to, read, a, newspaper, the, south,
