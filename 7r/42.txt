a, subsidy, or, government, incentive, is, a, type, of, government, expenditure, for, individuals, and, households, as, well, as, businesses, with, the, aim, of, stabilizing, the, economy, it, ensures, that, individuals, and, households, are, viable, by, having, access, to, essential, goods, and, services, while, giving, businesses, the, opportunity, to, stay, afloat, and, or, competitive, subsidies, not, only, promote, long, term, economic, stability, but, also, help, governments, to, respond, to, economic, shocks, during, a, recession, or, in, response, to, unforeseen, shocks, such, as, the, covid, 19, pandemic, subsidies, take, various, forms, such, as, direct, government, expenditures, tax, incentives, soft, loans, price, support, and, government, provision, of, goods, and, services, for, instance, the, government, may, distribute, direct, payment, subsidies, to, individuals, and, households, during, an, economic, downturn, in, order, to, help, its, citizens, pay, their, bills, and, to, stimulate, economic, activity, here, subsidies, act, as, an, effective, financial, aid, issued, when, the, economy, experiences, economic, hardship, they, can, also, be, a, good, policy, tool, to, revise, market, imperfections, when, rational, and, competitive, firms, fail, to, produce, an, optimal, market, outcome, for, example, in, an, imperfect, market, condition, governments, can, inject, subsidies, to, encourage, firms, to, invest, in, r, d, research, and, development, this, will, not, only, benefit, the, firms, but, also, produce, some, positive, externalities, such, that, it, benefits, the, industry, in, which, the, firms, belong, and, most, importantly, the, society, at, large, although, commonly, extended, from, the, government, the, term, subsidy, can, relate, to, any, type, of, support, for, example, from, ngos, or, as, implicit, subsidies, come, in, various, forms, including, direct, cash, grants, interest, free, loans, and, indirect, tax, breaks, insurance, low, interest, loans, accelerated, depreciation, rent, rebates, furthermore, they, can, be, broad, or, narrow, legal, or, illegal, ethical, or, unethical, the, most, common, forms, of, subsidies, are, those, to, the, producer, or, the, consumer, producer, production, subsidies, ensure, producers, are, better, off, by, either, supplying, market, price, support, direct, support, or, payments, to, factors, of, production, consumer, consumption, subsidies, commonly, reduce, the, price, of, goods, and, services, to, the, consumer, for, example, in, the, us, at, one, time, it, was, cheaper, to, buy, gasoline, than, bottled, water, all, countries, use, subsidies, via, national, and, sub, national, entities, through, different, forms, such, as, tax, incentives, and, direct, grants, likewise, subsidies, have, an, economic, influence, on, both, a, domestic, and, international, level, on, a, domestic, level, subsidies, affect, the, allocation, decision, of, domestic, resources, income, distribution, and, expenditure, productivity, on, an, international, level, subsidies, may, increase, or, decrease, international, interaction, and, integration, through, trade, for, this, reason, having, a, thorough, subsidy, policy, is, essential, as, its, inadequacy, can, potentially, lead, to, financial, hardship, and, problems, for, not, only, the, poor, or, low, income, individuals, but, the, aggregate, economy, as, a, whole, at, large, subsidies, take, up, a, substantial, portion, of, the, government, and, economy, amongst, oecd, countries, in, 2020, the, median, of, subsidies, and, other, transfers, such, as, social, benefits, and, non, repayable, transfers, to, private, and, public, enterprises, was, 56, 3, percent, of, total, government, expenses, which, was, 34, 9, percent, weighted, average, of, gdp, in, the, same, year, yet, the, number, of, subsidy, measures, in, force, have, been, rapidly, increasing, since, 2008, a, production, subsidy, encourages, suppliers, to, increase, the, output, of, a, particular, product, by, partially, offsetting, the, production, costs, or, losses, the, objective, of, production, subsidies, is, to, expand, production, of, a, particular, product, more, so, that, the, market, would, promote, but, without, raising, the, final, price, to, consumers, this, type, of, subsidy, is, predominantly, found, in, developed, markets, other, examples, of, production, subsidies, include, the, assistance, in, the, creation, of, a, new, firm, enterprise, investment, scheme, industry, industrial, policy, and, even, the, development, of, certain, areas, regional, policy, production, subsidies, are, critically, discussed, in, the, literature, as, they, can, cause, many, problems, including, the, additional, cost, of, storing, the, extra, produced, products, depressing, world, market, prices, and, incentivizing, producers, to, over, produce, for, example, a, farmer, overproducing, in, terms, of, his, land, s, carrying, capacity, a, consumption, subsidy, is, one, that, subsidizes, the, behavior, of, consumers, this, type, of, subsidies, are, most, common, in, developing, countries, where, governments, subsidise, such, things, as, food, water, electricity, and, education, on, the, basis, that, no, matter, how, impoverished, all, should, be, allowed, those, most, basic, requirements, for, example, some, governments, offer, lifeline, rates, for, electricity, that, is, the, first, increment, of, electricity, each, month, is, subsidized, evidence, from, recent, studies, suggests, that, government, expenditures, on, subsidies, remain, high, in, many, countries, often, amounting, to, several, percentage, points, of, gdp, subsidization, on, such, a, scale, implies, substantial, opportunity, costs, there, are, at, least, three, compelling, reasons, for, studying, government, subsidy, behavior, first, subsidies, are, a, major, instrument, of, government, expenditure, policy, second, on, a, domestic, level, subsidies, affect, domestic, resource, allocation, decisions, income, distribution, and, expenditure, productivity, a, consumer, subsidy, is, a, shift, in, demand, as, the, subsidy, is, given, directly, to, consumers, an, export, subsidy, is, a, support, from, the, government, for, products, that, are, exported, as, a, means, of, assisting, the, country, s, balance, of, payments, usha, haley, and, george, haley, identified, the, subsidies, to, manufacturing, industry, provided, by, the, chinese, government, and, how, they, have, altered, trade, patterns, traditionally, economists, have, argued, that, subsidies, benefit, consumers, but, hurt, the, subsidizing, countries, haley, and, haley, provided, data, to, show, that, over, the, decade, after, china, joined, the, world, trade, organization, industrial, subsidies, have, helped, give, china, an, advantage, in, industries, in, which, they, previously, enjoyed, no, comparative, advantage, such, as, the, steel, glass, paper, auto, parts, and, solar, industries, china, s, shores, have, also, collapsed, from, overfishing, and, industrialization, which, is, why, the, chinese, government, heavily, subsidizes, its, fishermen, who, sail, the, world, in, search, of, new, grounds, export, subsidy, is, known, for, being, abused, for, example, some, exporters, substantially, over, declare, the, value, of, their, goods, so, as, to, benefit, more, from, the, export, subsidy, another, method, is, to, export, a, batch, of, goods, to, a, foreign, country, but, the, same, goods, will, be, re, imported, by, the, same, trader, via, a, circuitous, route, and, changing, the, product, description, so, as, to, obscure, their, origin, thus, the, trader, benefits, from, the, export, subsidy, without, creating, real, trade, value, to, the, economy, export, subsidy, as, such, can, become, a, self, defeating, and, disruptive, policy, adam, smith, observed, that, special, government, subsidies, enabled, exporters, to, sell, abroad, at, substantial, ongoing, losses, he, did, not, regard, that, as, a, sound, and, sustainable, policy, that, was, because, under, normal, industrial, commercial, conditions, their, own, interests, soon, oblige, loss, making, businesses, to, deploy, their, capital, in, other, ways, or, to, move, into, markets, where, the, sales, prices, do, cover, the, supply, costs, and, yield, ordinary, profits, like, other, mercantilist, schemes, and, devices, export, bounties, are, a, means, of, trying, to, force, business, capital, into, channels, it, would, not, naturally, enter, the, schemes, are, invariably, costly, and, damaging, in, various, ways, an, import, subsidy, is, support, from, the, government, for, products, that, are, imported, rarer, than, an, export, subsidy, an, import, subsidy, further, reduces, the, price, to, consumers, for, imported, goods, import, subsidies, have, various, effects, depending, on, the, subject, for, example, consumers, in, the, importing, country, are, better, off, and, experience, an, increase, in, consumer, welfare, due, to, the, decrease, in, price, of, the, imported, goods, as, well, as, the, decrease, in, price, of, the, domestic, substitute, goods, conversely, the, consumers, in, the, exporting, country, experience, a, decrease, in, consumer, welfare, due, to, an, increase, in, the, price, of, their, domestic, goods, furthermore, producers, of, the, importing, country, experience, a, loss, of, welfare, due, to, a, decrease, in, the, price, for, the, goods, in, their, market, while, on, the, other, side, the, exporters, of, the, producing, country, experience, an, increase, in, well, being, due, to, the, increase, in, demand, ultimately, the, import, subsidy, is, rarely, used, due, to, an, overall, loss, of, welfare, for, the, country, due, to, a, decrease, in, domestic, production, and, a, reduction, in, production, throughout, the, world, however, that, can, result, in, a, redistribution, of, income, employment, or, wage, subsidies, keep, the, employment, relationship, ongoing, even, during, financial, crisis, it, is, particularly, beneficial, for, enterprises, to, recover, quickly, after, a, temporary, suspension, following, a, crisis, workers, are, prevented, from, losing, their, jobs, and, other, associated, employment, benefits, such, as, annual, leave, entitlements, and, retirement, pensions, employment, subsidies, allow, individual, beneficiaries, a, minimum, standard, of, living, at, the, very, least, however, less, than, half, of, active, jobseekers, in, around, 50, of, oecd, countries, receive, unemployment, support, the, effect, of, employment, subsidies, may, not, be, evident, immediately, when, employers, received, grants, to, subside, a, substantial, part, of, the, wages, for, retaining, their, employees, or, to, create, new, jobs, during, severe, recessions, such, as, the, 2008, gfc, global, financial, crisis, there, were, minor, impacts, on, employment, during, the, first, year, however, the, subsidy, began, to, yield, positive, effects, on, employment, particularly, a, decrease, in, the, unemployment, rate, in, the, second, year, as, employers, began, to, properly, utilise, the, subsidy, tax, subsidies, also, known, as, tax, breaks, or, tax, expenditures, are, a, way, for, governments, to, achieve, certain, outcomes, without, directly, providing, cash, payments, by, offering, tax, breaks, the, government, can, incentivize, behavior, that, is, beneficial, to, the, economy, or, society, as, a, whole, however, tax, subsidies, can, also, have, negative, consequences, one, type, of, tax, subsidy, is, a, health, tax, deduction, which, allows, individuals, or, businesses, to, deduct, their, health, expenses, from, their, taxable, income, this, can, be, seen, as, a, way, to, incentivize, people, to, prioritize, their, health, and, well, being, however, it, can, also, create, distortions, in, the, economy, by, encouraging, people, to, spend, more, on, health, care, than, they, otherwise, would, another, type, of, tax, subsidy, is, related, to, intellectual, property, base, erosion, and, profit, shifting, beps, is, a, particular, form, of, tax, subsidy, that, involves, companies, shifting, their, profits, to, low, tax, jurisdictions, in, order, to, reduce, their, overall, tax, burden, the, multilateral, convention, to, implement, tax, treaty, related, measures, to, prevent, base, erosion, and, profit, shifting, is, a, treaty, signed, by, half, the, nations, of, the, world, aimed, at, preventing, this, type, of, tax, avoidance, while, tax, subsidies, can, be, effective, in, achieving, certain, outcomes, they, are, also, less, transparent, than, direct, cash, payments, and, can, be, difficult, to, undo, additionally, some, argue, that, tax, breaks, disproportionately, benefit, the, wealthy, and, large, corporations, further, exacerbating, income, inequality, therefore, it, is, important, for, governments, to, carefully, consider, the, potential, consequences, of, offering, tax, subsidies, and, ensure, that, they, are, targeted, towards, achieving, the, greatest, public, good, furthermore, tax, subsidies, can, have, unintended, consequences, such, as, creating, market, distortions, that, favor, certain, industries, or, companies, over, others, for, example, if, a, government, offers, tax, breaks, to, incentivize, investment, in, renewable, energy, it, may, lead, to, a, glut, of, renewable, energy, projects, and, an, oversupply, of, energy, in, the, market, this, in, turn, can, lead, to, lower, prices, for, energy, and, financial, losses, for, investors, in, addition, tax, subsidies, can, be, difficult, to, monitor, and, enforce, which, can, lead, to, abuse, and, fraud, companies, may, claim, tax, breaks, for, activities, that, do, not, qualify, or, may, use, complex, legal, structures, to, shift, profits, to, lower, tax, jurisdictions, this, can, result, in, lost, revenue, for, governments, and, a, lack, of, fairness, in, the, tax, system, despite, these, concerns, tax, subsidies, remain, a, popular, tool, for, governments, to, promote, various, policy, objectives, such, as, economic, growth, job, creation, and, environmental, sustainability, the, use, of, tax, subsidies, is, often, debated, in, political, circles, with, some, arguing, that, they, are, necessary, to, support, certain, industries, or, to, incentivize, certain, behaviors, while, others, argue, that, they, create, inefficiencies, and, distortions, in, the, economy, in, conclusion, tax, subsidies, are, a, powerful, tool, for, governments, to, achieve, policy, goals, but, they, come, with, their, own, set, of, challenges, and, limitations, it, is, important, for, policymakers, to, carefully, consider, the, potential, unintended, consequences, of, tax, subsidies, and, to, design, them, in, a, way, that, maximizes, their, benefits, while, minimizing, their, costs, additionally, strong, monitoring, and, enforcement, mechanisms, are, needed, to, ensure, that, tax, subsidies, are, used, appropriately, and, do, not, result, in, abuse, or, fraud, some, governments, subsidise, transport, especially, rail, and, bus, transport, which, decrease, congestion, and, pollution, compared, to, cars, in, the, eu, rail, subsidies, are, around, 73, billion, and, chinese, subsidies, reach, 130, billion, publicly, owned, airports, can, be, an, indirect, subsidy, if, they, lose, money, the, european, union, for, instance, criticizes, germany, for, its, high, number, of, money, losing, airports, that, are, used, primarily, by, low, cost, carriers, characterizing, the, arrangement, as, an, illegal, subsidy, in, many, countries, roads, and, highways, are, paid, for, through, general, revenue, rather, than, tolls, or, other, dedicated, sources, that, are, paid, only, by, road, users, creating, an, indirect, subsidy, for, road, transportation, the, fact, that, long, distance, buses, in, germany, do, not, pay, tolls, has, been, called, an, indirect, subsidy, by, critics, who, point, to, track, access, charges, for, railways, energy, subsidies, are, measures, that, keep, prices, for, customers, below, market, levels, or, for, suppliers, above, market, levels, or, reduce, costs, for, customers, and, suppliers, energy, subsidies, may, be, direct, cash, transfers, to, suppliers, customers, or, related, bodies, as, well, as, indirect, support, mechanisms, such, as, tax, exemptions, and, rebates, price, controls, trade, restrictions, and, limits, on, market, access, during, fy, 2016, 22, most, us, federal, subsidies, were, for, renewable, energy, producers, primarily, biofuels, wind, and, solar, low, income, households, and, energy, efficiency, improvements, during, fy, 2016, 22, nearly, half, 46, of, federal, energy, subsidies, were, associated, with, renewable, energy, and, 35, were, associated, with, energy, end, uses, federal, support, for, renewable, energy, of, all, types, more, than, doubled, from, 7, 4, billion, in, fy, 2016, to, 15, 6, billion, in, fy, 2022, fossil, fuel, subsidies, are, energy, subsidies, on, fossil, fuels, they, may, be, tax, breaks, on, consumption, such, as, a, lower, sales, tax, on, natural, gas, for, residential, heating, or, subsidies, on, production, such, as, tax, breaks, on, exploration, for, oil, or, they, may, be, free, or, cheap, negative, externalities, such, as, air, pollution, or, climate, change, due, to, burning, gasoline, diesel, and, jet, fuel, some, fossil, fuel, subsidies, are, via, electricity, generation, such, as, subsidies, for, coal, fired, power, stations, eliminating, fossil, fuel, subsidies, would, reduce, the, health, risks, of, air, pollution, and, would, greatly, reduce, global, carbon, emissions, thus, helping, to, limit, climate, change, as, of, 2021, policy, researchers, estimate, that, substantially, more, money, is, spent, on, fossil, fuel, subsidies, than, on, environmentally, harmful, agricultural, subsidies, or, environmentally, harmful, water, subsidies, the, international, energy, agency, says, high, fossil, fuel, prices, hit, the, poor, hardest, but, subsidies, are, rarely, well, targeted, to, protect, vulnerable, groups, and, tend, to, benefit, better, off, segments, of, the, population, housing, subsidies, are, designed, to, promote, the, construction, industry, and, homeownership, as, of, 2018, u, s, housing, subsidies, total, around, 15, billion, per, year, housing, subsidies, can, come, in, two, types, assistance, with, down, payment, and, interest, rate, subsidies, the, deduction, of, mortgage, interest, from, the, federal, income, tax, accounts, for, the, largest, interest, rate, subsidy, additionally, the, federal, government, will, help, low, income, families, with, the, down, payment, coming, to, 10, 9, million, in, 2008, as, a, housing, policy, tool, housing, subsidies, also, help, low, income, individuals, gain, and, maintain, liveable, residency, by, easing, the, cost, burdens, of, housing, for, low, income, individuals, and, households, however, some, policy, makers, and, experts, believe, they, are, costly, to, implement, and, may, even, reduce, incentives, for, beneficiaries, to, participate, in, the, labour, market, in, the, contrary, certain, literatures, have, found, that, subsidy, cuts, do, not, encourage, employment, or, participation, among, beneficiaries, for, example, research, by, daniel, borbely, found, that, reducing, housing, subsidies, did, not, increase, employment, and, labour, force, participation, though, he, also, added, that, claimants, relocated, to, other, areas, of, the, rental, market, to, maintain, their, benefits, nonetheless, the, most, common, method, for, providing, housing, subsidies, is, via, direct, payments, to, renters, by, covering, a, part, of, their, rent, on, the, private, rent, market, this, method, of, direct, transfer, of, housing, subsidies, is, often, referred, to, as, housing, vouchers, in, the, united, states, the, so, called, section, 8, is, a, direct, payment, program, subsidising, the, largest, amount, of, money, to, renters, for, rental, assistance, while, conventional, subsidies, require, financial, support, many, economists, have, described, implicit, subsidies, in, the, form, of, untaxed, environmental, externalities, these, externalities, include, things, such, as, pollution, from, vehicle, emissions, pesticides, or, other, sources, a, 2015, report, studied, the, implicit, subsidies, accruing, to, 20, fossil, fuel, companies, it, estimated, that, the, societal, costs, from, downstream, emissions, and, pollution, attributable, to, these, companies, were, substantial, the, report, spans, the, period, 2008, 2012, and, notes, that, for, all, companies, and, all, years, the, economic, cost, to, society, of, their, co, 2, emissions, was, greater, than, their, after, tax, profit, with, the, single, exception, of, exxonmobil, in, 2008, 4, pure, coal, companies, fare, even, worse, the, economic, cost, to, society, exceeds, total, revenue, employment, taxes, supply, purchases, and, indirect, employment, in, all, years, with, this, cost, varying, between, nearly, 2, and, nearly, 9, per, 1, of, revenue, 4, 5, the, first, important, classification, of, subsidies, are, direct, and, indirect, subsidies, subsidies, are, categorised, as, direct, when, it, involves, actual, cash, outlays, targeted, towards, a, specified, individual, or, household, popular, examples, includes, cash, grants, and, interest, free, loans, subsidies, can, also, be, classified, as, indirect, when, they, do, not, involve, actual, payments, an, example, would, be, an, increase, in, disposable, income, arising, from, a, decrease, in, price, of, an, essential, good, or, service, that, the, government, has, enforced, in, a, form, of, monetary, support, in, contrast, a, decrease, in, the, price, of, a, good, or, service, may, lead, to, an, increase, in, revenue, for, producers, earned, from, the, heightened, demand, by, consumers, the, use, of, indirect, subsidies, such, as, price, controls, is, widespread, among, developing, economies, and, emerging, markets, as, a, necessary, tool, for, social, policy, it, has, proven, to, be, effective, in, many, cases, but, price, controls, have, a, potential, to, dampen, investment, activity, and, growth, cause, heavy, fiscal, burdens, for, the, government, and, may, even, complicate, the, optimal, performance, of, monetary, policy, to, prevent, the, undesirable, negative, effects, price, control, regimes, may, be, replaced, by, creating, social, safety, nets, and, proposing, sound, reforms, to, encourage, competition, and, growth, another, important, classification, of, subsidies, are, producer, production, subsidies, and, consumer, consumption, subsidies, production, subsidies, are, designed, to, ensure, producers, are, advantaged, by, creating, fluid, market, activity, through, other, market, control, mechanisms, or, by, providing, cash, payments, for, factors, of, production, consumption, subsidies, benefit, consumers, typically, through, a, reduction, in, the, market, price, of, goods, and, services, they, are, commonly, used, by, governments, of, many, developing, countries, in, an, attempt, to, secure, the, most, basic, needs, for, its, population, these, various, subsidies, can, be, divided, into, broad, and, narrow, narrow, subsidies, are, those, monetary, transfers, that, are, easily, identifiable, and, have, a, clear, intent, they, are, commonly, characterised, by, a, monetary, transfer, between, governments, and, institutions, or, businesses, and, individuals, a, classic, example, is, a, government, payment, to, a, farmer, conversely, broad, subsidies, include, both, monetary, and, non, monetary, subsidies, and, is, often, difficult, to, identify, a, broad, subsidy, is, less, attributable, and, less, transparent, environmental, externalities, are, the, most, common, type, of, broad, subsidy, competitive, equilibrium, is, a, state, of, balance, between, buyers, and, suppliers, in, which, the, quantity, demanded, of, a, good, is, the, quantity, supplied, at, a, specified, price, when, the, price, falls, the, quantity, demand, exceeds, the, equilibrium, quantity, conversely, a, reduction, in, the, supply, of, a, good, beyond, equilibrium, quantity, implies, an, increase, in, the, price, the, effect, of, a, subsidy, is, to, shift, the, supply, or, demand, curve, to, the, right, i, e, increases, the, supply, or, demand, by, the, amount, of, the, subsidy, if, a, consumer, is, receiving, the, subsidy, a, lower, price, of, a, good, resulting, from, the, marginal, subsidy, on, consumption, increases, demand, shifting, the, demand, curve, to, the, right, if, a, supplier, is, receiving, the, subsidy, an, increase, in, the, price, revenue, resulting, from, the, marginal, subsidy, on, production, results, increases, supply, shifting, the, supply, curve, to, the, right, assuming, the, market, is, in, a, perfectly, competitive, equilibrium, a, subsidy, increases, the, supply, of, the, good, beyond, the, equilibrium, competitive, quantity, the, imbalance, creates, deadweight, loss, deadweight, loss, from, a, subsidy, is, the, amount, by, which, the, cost, of, the, subsidy, exceeds, the, gains, of, the, subsidy, the, magnitude, of, the, deadweight, loss, is, dependent, on, the, size, of, the, subsidy, this, is, considered, a, market, failure, or, inefficiency, subsidies, targeted, at, goods, in, one, country, by, lowering, the, price, of, those, goods, make, them, more, competitive, against, foreign, goods, thereby, reducing, foreign, competition, as, a, result, many, developing, countries, cannot, engage, in, foreign, trade, and, receive, lower, prices, for, their, products, in, the, global, market, this, is, considered, protectionism, a, government, policy, to, erect, trade, barriers, in, order, to, protect, domestic, industries, the, problem, with, protectionism, arises, when, industries, are, selected, for, nationalistic, reasons, infant, industry, rather, than, to, gain, a, comparative, advantage, the, market, distortion, and, reduction, in, social, welfare, is, the, logic, behind, the, world, bank, policy, for, the, removal, of, subsidies, in, developing, countries, subsidies, create, spillover, effects, in, other, economic, sectors, and, industries, a, subsidized, product, sold, in, the, world, market, lowers, the, price, of, the, good, in, other, countries, since, subsidies, result, in, lower, revenues, for, producers, of, foreign, countries, they, are, a, source, of, tension, between, the, united, states, europe, and, poorer, developing, countries, while, subsidies, may, provide, immediate, benefits, to, an, industry, in, the, long, run, they, may, prove, to, have, unethical, negative, effects, subsidies, are, intended, to, support, public, interest, however, they, can, violate, ethical, or, legal, principles, if, they, lead, to, higher, consumer, prices, or, discriminate, against, some, producers, to, benefit, others, for, example, domestic, subsidies, granted, by, individual, us, states, may, be, unconstitutional, if, they, discriminate, against, out, of, state, producers, violating, the, privileges, and, immunities, clause, or, the, dormant, commerce, clause, of, the, united, states, constitution, depending, on, their, nature, subsidies, are, discouraged, by, international, trade, agreements, such, as, the, world, trade, organization, wto, this, trend, however, may, change, in, the, future, as, needs, of, sustainable, development, and, environmental, protection, could, suggest, different, interpretations, regarding, energy, and, renewable, energy, subsidies, in, its, july, 2019, report, going, for, growth, 2019, the, time, for, reform, is, now, the, oecd, suggests, that, countries, make, better, use, of, environmental, taxation, phase, out, agricultural, subsidies, and, environmentally, harmful, tax, breaks, in, the, netherlands, audits, are, performed, to, verify, whether, the, funds, that, have, been, received, has, indeed, been, spent, legally, and, all, requirements, of, the, subsidy, provider, have, been, attained, for, the, purpose, intended, it, hence, prevents, fraud, although, subsidies, can, be, important, many, are, perverse, in, the, sense, of, having, adverse, unintended, consequences, to, be, perverse, subsidies, must, exert, effects, that, are, demonstrably, and, significantly, adverse, both, economically, and, environmentally, a, subsidy, rarely, if, ever, starts, perverse, but, over, time, a, legitimate, efficacious, subsidy, can, become, perverse, or, illegitimate, if, it, is, not, withdrawn, after, meeting, its, goal, or, as, political, goals, change, perverse, subsidies, are, now, so, widespread, that, as, of, 2007, they, amounted, 2, trillion, per, year, in, the, six, most, subsidised, sectors, alone, agriculture, fossil, fuels, road, transportation, water, fisheries, and, forestry, the, detrimental, effects, of, perverse, subsidies, are, diverse, in, nature, and, reach, case, studies, from, differing, sectors, are, highlighted, below, but, can, be, summarised, as, follows, directly, they, are, expensive, to, governments, by, directing, resources, away, from, other, legitimate, should, priorities, such, as, environmental, conservation, education, health, or, infrastructure, ultimately, reducing, the, fiscal, health, of, the, government, indirectly, they, cause, environmental, degradation, exploitation, of, resources, pollution, loss, of, landscape, misuse, and, overuse, of, supplies, which, as, well, as, its, fundamental, damage, acts, as, a, further, brake, on, economies, tend, to, benefit, the, few, at, the, expense, of, the, many, and, the, rich, at, the, expense, of, the, poor, lead, to, further, polarization, of, development, between, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, lower, global, market, prices, and, undermine, investment, decisions, reducing, the, pressure, on, businesses, to, become, more, efficient, over, time, the, latter, effect, means, support, becomes, enshrined, in, human, behaviour, and, business, decisions, to, the, point, where, people, become, reliant, on, even, addicted, to, subsidies, locking, them, into, society, consumer, attitudes, do, not, change, and, become, out, of, date, off, target, and, inefficient, furthermore, over, time, people, feel, a, sense, of, historical, right, to, them, perverse, subsidies, are, not, tackled, as, robustly, as, they, should, be, principally, this, is, because, they, become, locked, into, society, causing, bureaucratic, roadblocks, and, institutional, inertia, when, cuts, are, suggested, many, argue, most, fervently, by, those, entitled, special, interest, groups, and, political, lobbyists, that, it, will, disrupt, and, harm, the, lives, of, people, who, receive, them, distort, domestic, competitiveness, curbing, trade, opportunities, and, increase, unemployment, individual, governments, recognise, this, as, a, prisoner, s, dilemma, insofar, as, that, even, if, they, wanted, to, adopt, subsidy, reform, by, acting, unilaterally, they, fear, only, negative, effects, will, ensue, if, others, do, not, follow, furthermore, cutting, subsidies, however, perverse, they, may, be, is, considered, a, vote, losing, policy, reform, of, perverse, subsidies, is, at, a, propitious, time, the, current, economic, conditions, mean, governments, are, forced, into, fiscal, constraints, and, are, looking, for, ways, to, reduce, activist, roles, in, their, economies, there, are, two, main, reform, paths, unilateral, and, multilateral, unilateral, agreements, one, country, are, less, likely, to, be, undertaken, for, the, reasons, outlined, above, although, new, zealand, russia, bangladesh, and, others, represent, successful, examples, multilateral, actions, by, several, countries, are, more, likely, to, succeed, as, this, reduces, competitiveness, concerns, but, are, more, complex, to, implement, requiring, greater, international, collaboration, through, a, body, such, as, the, wto, irrespective, of, the, path, the, aim, of, policymakers, should, be, to, create, alternative, policies, that, target, the, same, issue, as, the, original, subsidies, but, better, develop, subsidy, removal, strategies, allowing, market, discipline, to, return, introduce, sunset, provisions, that, require, remaining, subsidies, to, be, re, justified, periodically, and, make, perverse, subsidies, more, transparent, to, taxpayers, to, alleviate, the, vote, loser, concern, support, for, agriculture, dates, back, to, the, 19th, century, it, was, developed, extensively, in, the, eu, and, us, across, the, two, world, wars, and, the, great, depression, to, protect, domestic, food, production, but, remains, important, across, the, world, today, in, 2005, us, farmers, received, 14, billion, and, eu, farmers, 47, billion, in, agricultural, subsidies, today, agricultural, subsidies, are, defended, on, the, grounds, of, helping, farmers, to, maintain, their, livelihoods, the, majority, of, payments, are, based, on, outputs, and, inputs, and, thus, favour, the, larger, producing, agribusinesses, over, the, small, scale, farmers, in, the, us, nearly, 30, of, payments, go, to, the, top, 2, of, farmers, by, subsidising, inputs, and, outputs, through, such, schemes, as, yield, based, subsidisation, farmers, are, encouraged, to, over, produce, using, intensive, methods, including, using, more, fertilizers, and, pesticides, grow, high, yielding, monocultures, reduce, crop, rotation, shorten, fallow, periods, and, promote, exploitative, land, use, change, from, forests, rainforests, and, wetlands, to, agricultural, land, these, all, lead, to, severe, environmental, degradation, including, adverse, effects, on, soil, quality, and, productivity, including, erosion, nutrient, supply, and, salinity, which, in, turn, affects, carbon, storage, and, cycling, water, retention, and, drought, resistance, water, quality, including, pollution, nutrient, deposition, and, eutrophication, of, waterways, and, lowering, of, water, tables, diversity, of, flora, and, fauna, including, indigenous, species, both, directly, and, indirectly, through, the, destruction, of, habitats, resulting, in, a, genetic, wipe, out, cotton, growers, in, the, us, reportedly, receive, half, their, income, from, the, government, under, the, farm, bill, of, 2002, the, subsidy, payments, stimulated, overproduction, and, resulted, in, a, record, cotton, harvest, in, 2002, much, of, which, had, to, be, sold, at, very, reduced, prices, in, the, global, market, for, foreign, producers, the, depressed, cotton, price, lowered, their, prices, far, below, the, break, even, price, in, fact, african, farmers, received, 35, to, 40, cents, per, pound, for, cotton, while, us, cotton, growers, backed, by, government, agricultural, payments, received, 75, cents, per, pound, developing, countries, and, trade, organizations, argue, that, poorer, countries, should, be, able, to, export, their, principal, commodities, to, survive, but, protectionist, laws, and, payments, in, the, united, states, and, europe, prevent, these, countries, from, engaging, in, international, trade, opportunities, today, much, of, the, world, s, major, fisheries, are, overexploited, in, 2002, the, wwf, estimate, this, at, approximately, 75, fishing, subsidies, include, direct, assistant, to, fishers, loan, support, programs, tax, preferences, and, insurance, support, capital, and, infrastructure, programs, marketing, and, price, support, programs, and, fisheries, management, research, and, conservation, programs, they, promote, the, expansion, of, fishing, fleets, the, supply, of, larger, and, longer, nets, larger, yields, and, indiscriminate, catch, as, well, as, mitigating, risks, which, encourages, further, investment, into, large, scale, operations, to, the, disfavour, of, the, already, struggling, small, scale, industry, collectively, these, result, in, the, continued, overcapitalization, and, overfishing, of, marine, fisheries, there, are, four, categories, of, fisheries, subsidies, first, are, direct, financial, transfers, second, are, indirect, financial, transfers, and, services, third, certain, forms, of, intervention, and, fourth, not, intervening, the, first, category, regards, direct, payments, from, the, government, received, by, the, fisheries, industry, these, typically, affect, profits, of, the, industry, in, the, short, term, and, can, be, negative, or, positive, category, two, pertains, to, government, intervention, not, involving, those, under, the, first, category, these, subsidies, also, affect, the, profits, in, the, short, term, but, typically, are, not, negative, category, three, includes, intervention, that, results, in, a, negative, short, term, economic, impact, but, economic, benefits, in, the, long, term, these, benefits, are, usually, more, general, societal, benefits, such, as, the, environment, the, final, category, pertains, to, inaction, by, the, government, allowing, producers, to, impose, certain, production, costs, on, others, these, subsidies, tend, to, lead, to, positive, benefits, in, the, short, term, but, negative, in, the, long, term, a, survey, of, manufacturing, in, britain, found, government, subsidies, had, had, various, unintended, dysfunctional, consequences, the, subsidies, had, usually, been, selective, or, discriminatory, benefiting, some, companies, at, the, expense, of, others, government, money, in, the, form, of, grants, and, awards, of, production, and, r, d, contracts, had, gone, to, advanced, and, viable, firms, as, well, as, old, uneconomic, enterprises, however, the, main, recipients, had, been, larger, established, companies, while, most, of, the, firms, pioneering, radical, technical, product, developments, with, long, term, economic, growth, potential, had, been, new, small, enterprises, the, study, concluded, that, instead, of, providing, subsidies, governments, wanting, to, benefit, industrial, technological, development, and, performance, should, lower, standard, rates, of, business, taxation, raise, tax, allowances, for, investments, in, new, plant, equipment, and, products, and, remove, obstacles, to, market, competition, and, customer, choice, the, us, national, football, league, s, nfl, profits, have, topped, records, at, 11, billion, the, highest, of, all, sports, the, nfl, had, tax, exempt, status, until, voluntarily, relinquishing, it, in, 2015, and, new, stadiums, have, been, built, with, public,
