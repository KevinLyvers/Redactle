disgust, middle, french, desgouster, from, latin, gustus, taste, is, an, emotional, response, of, rejection, or, revulsion, to, something, potentially, contagious, or, something, considered, offensive, distasteful, or, unpleasant, in, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, charles, darwin, wrote, that, disgust, is, a, sensation, that, refers, to, something, revolting, disgust, is, experienced, primarily, in, relation, to, the, sense, of, taste, either, perceived, or, imagined, and, secondarily, to, anything, which, causes, a, similar, feeling, by, sense, of, smell, touch, or, vision, musically, sensitive, people, may, even, be, disgusted, by, the, cacophony, of, inharmonious, sounds, research, has, continually, proven, a, relationship, between, disgust, and, anxiety, disorders, such, as, arachnophobia, blood, injection, injury, type, phobias, and, contamination, fear, related, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, also, known, as, ocd, disgust, is, one, of, the, basic, emotions, of, robert, plutchik, s, theory, of, emotions, and, has, been, studied, extensively, by, paul, rozin, it, invokes, a, characteristic, facial, expression, one, of, paul, ekman, s, six, universal, facial, expressions, of, emotion, unlike, the, emotions, of, fear, anger, and, sadness, disgust, is, associated, with, a, decrease, in, heart, rate, it, is, believed, that, the, emotion, of, disgust, has, evolved, as, a, response, to, offensive, foods, that, may, cause, harm, to, the, organism, a, common, example, of, this, is, found, in, human, beings, who, show, disgust, reactions, to, mouldy, milk, or, contaminated, meat, disgust, appears, to, be, triggered, by, objects, or, people, who, possess, attributes, that, signify, disease, self, report, and, behavioural, studies, found, that, disgust, elicitors, include, the, above, mentioned, main, disgust, stimuli, are, similar, to, one, another, in, the, sense, that, they, can, all, potentially, transmit, infections, and, are, the, most, common, referenced, elicitors, of, disgust, cross, culturally, because, of, this, disgust, is, believed, to, have, evolved, as, a, component, of, a, behavioral, immune, system, in, which, the, body, attempts, to, avoid, disease, carrying, pathogens, in, preference, to, fighting, them, after, they, have, entered, the, body, this, behavioral, immune, system, has, been, found, to, make, sweeping, generalizations, because, it, is, more, costly, to, perceive, a, sick, person, as, healthy, than, to, perceive, a, healthy, person, as, sickly, researchers, have, found, that, sensitivity, to, disgust, is, negatively, correlated, to, aggression, because, feelings, of, disgust, typically, bring, about, a, need, to, withdraw, while, aggression, results, in, a, need, to, approach, this, can, be, explained, in, terms, of, each, of, the, types, of, disgust, for, those, especially, sensitive, to, moral, disgust, they, would, want, to, be, less, aggressive, because, they, want, to, avoid, hurting, others, those, especially, sensitive, to, pathogen, disgust, might, be, motivated, by, a, desire, to, avoid, the, possibility, of, an, open, wound, on, the, victim, of, the, aggression, those, sensitive, to, sexual, disgust, must, have, some, sexual, object, present, to, be, especially, avoidant, of, aggression, based, on, these, findings, disgust, may, be, used, as, an, emotional, tool, to, decrease, aggression, in, individuals, disgust, may, produce, specific, autonomic, responses, such, as, reduced, blood, pressure, lowered, heart, rate, and, decreased, skin, conductance, along, with, changes, in, respiratory, behaviour, research, has, also, found, that, people, who, are, more, sensitive, to, disgust, tend, to, find, their, own, in, group, more, attractive, and, tend, to, have, more, negative, attitudes, toward, other, groups, this, may, be, explained, by, assuming, that, people, begin, to, associate, outsiders, and, foreigners, with, disease, and, danger, while, simultaneously, associating, health, freedom, from, disease, and, safety, with, people, similar, to, themselves, taking, a, further, look, into, hygiene, disgust, was, the, strongest, predictor, of, negative, attitudes, toward, obese, individuals, a, disgust, reaction, to, obese, individuals, was, also, connected, with, views, of, moral, values, tybur, et, al, outlines, three, domains, of, disgust, pathogen, disgust, which, motivates, the, avoidance, of, infectious, microorganisms, sexual, disgust, which, motivates, the, avoidance, of, sexual, partners, and, behaviors, and, moral, disgust, which, motivates, people, to, avoid, breaking, social, norms, disgust, may, have, an, important, role, in, certain, forms, of, morality, pathogen, disgust, arises, from, a, desire, to, survive, and, ultimately, a, fear, of, death, he, compares, it, to, a, behavioral, immune, system, that, is, the, first, line, of, defense, against, potentially, deadly, agents, such, as, dead, bodies, rotting, food, and, vomit, sexual, disgust, arises, from, a, desire, to, avoid, biologically, costly, mates, and, a, consideration, of, the, consequences, of, certain, reproductive, choices, the, two, primary, considerations, are, intrinsic, quality, e, g, body, symmetry, facial, attractiveness, etc, and, genetic, compatibility, e, g, avoidance, of, inbreeding, such, as, the, incest, taboo, moral, disgust, pertains, to, social, transgressions, and, may, include, behaviors, such, as, lying, theft, murder, and, rape, unlike, the, other, two, domains, moral, disgust, motivates, avoidance, of, social, relationships, with, norm, violating, individuals, because, those, relationships, threaten, group, cohesion, women, generally, report, greater, disgust, than, men, especially, regarding, sexual, disgust, or, general, repulsiveness, which, have, been, argued, to, be, consistent, with, women, being, more, selective, regarding, sex, for, evolutionary, reasons, sensitivity, to, disgust, rises, during, pregnancy, along, with, levels, of, the, hormone, progesterone, scientists, have, conjectured, that, pregnancy, requires, the, mother, to, dial, down, her, immune, system, so, that, the, developing, embryo, won, t, be, attacked, to, protect, the, mother, this, lowered, immune, system, is, then, compensated, by, a, heightened, sense, of, disgust, because, disgust, is, an, emotion, with, physical, responses, to, undesirable, or, dirty, situations, studies, have, proven, there, are, cardiovascular, and, respiratory, changes, while, experiencing, the, emotion, of, disgust, as, mentioned, earlier, women, experience, disgust, more, prominently, than, men, this, is, reflected, in, a, study, about, dental, phobia, a, dental, phobia, comes, from, experiencing, disgust, when, thinking, about, the, dentist, and, all, that, entails, 4, 6, percent, of, women, compared, to, 2, 7, percent, of, men, find, the, dentist, disgusting, in, a, series, of, significant, studies, by, paul, ekman, in, the, 1970s, it, was, discovered, that, facial, expressions, of, emotion, are, not, culturally, determined, but, universal, across, human, cultures, and, thus, likely, to, be, biological, in, origin, the, facial, expression, of, disgust, was, found, to, be, one, of, these, facial, expressions, this, characteristic, facial, expression, includes, slightly, narrowed, brows, waving, the, hand, back, and, forth, although, different, elicitors, may, produce, different, forms, of, this, expression, it, was, found, that, the, facial, expression, of, disgust, is, readily, recognizable, across, cultures, this, facial, expression, is, also, produced, in, blind, individuals, and, is, correctly, interpreted, by, deaf, individuals, this, evidence, indicates, an, innate, biological, basis, for, the, expression, and, recognition, of, disgust, the, recognition, of, disgust, is, also, important, among, species, as, it, has, been, found, that, when, an, individual, sees, a, conspecific, looking, disgusted, after, tasting, a, particular, food, he, or, she, automatically, infers, that, the, food, is, bad, and, should, not, be, eaten, this, evidence, suggests, that, disgust, is, experienced, and, recognized, almost, universally, and, strongly, implicates, its, evolutionary, significance, facial, feedback, has, also, been, implicated, in, the, expression, of, disgust, that, is, the, making, of, the, facial, expression, of, disgust, leads, to, an, increased, feeling, of, disgust, this, can, occur, if, the, person, just, wrinkles, one, s, nose, without, awareness, that, they, are, making, a, disgust, expression, the, mirror, neuron, matching, system, found, in, monkeys, and, humans, is, a, proposed, explanation, for, such, recognition, and, shows, that, our, internal, representation, of, actions, is, triggered, during, the, observation, of, another, s, actions, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, a, similar, mechanism, may, apply, to, emotions, seeing, someone, else, s, facial, emotional, expressions, triggers, the, neural, activity, that, would, relate, to, our, own, experience, of, the, same, emotion, this, points, to, the, universality, as, well, as, survival, value, of, the, emotion, of, disgust, at, a, very, young, age, children, are, able, to, identify, different, basic, facial, emotions, if, a, parent, makes, a, negative, face, and, a, positive, emotional, face, toward, two, different, toys, a, child, as, young, as, five, months, would, avoid, the, toy, associated, with, a, negative, face, young, children, tend, to, associate, a, face, showing, disgust, with, anger, instead, of, being, able, to, identify, the, difference, adults, can, make, the, distinction, the, age, of, understanding, seems, to, be, around, ten, years, old, because, disgust, is, partially, a, result, of, social, conditioning, there, are, differences, among, different, cultures, in, the, objects, of, disgust, for, example, americans, are, more, likely, to, link, feelings, of, disgust, to, actions, that, limit, a, person, s, rights, or, degrade, a, person, s, dignity, while, japanese, people, are, more, likely, to, link, feelings, of, disgust, to, actions, that, frustrate, their, integration, into, the, social, world, furthermore, practices, viewed, as, acceptable, in, some, cultures, may, be, viewed, as, disgusting, in, other, cultures, in, english, the, concept, disgust, can, apply, to, both, physical, and, abstract, things, but, in, hindi, and, malayalam, languages, the, concept, does, not, apply, to, both, disgust, is, one, of, the, basic, emotions, recognizable, across, multiple, cultures, and, is, a, response, to, something, revolting, typically, involving, taste, or, sight, though, different, cultures, find, different, things, disgusting, the, reaction, to, the, grotesque, things, remains, the, same, throughout, each, culture, people, and, their, emotional, reactions, in, the, realm, of, disgust, remain, the, same, the, scientific, attempts, to, map, specific, emotions, onto, underlying, neural, substrates, dates, back, to, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, functional, mri, experiments, have, revealed, that, the, anterior, insula, in, the, brain, is, particularly, active, when, experiencing, disgust, when, being, exposed, to, offensive, tastes, and, when, viewing, facial, expressions, of, disgust, the, research, has, supported, that, there, are, independent, neural, systems, in, the, brain, each, handling, a, specific, basic, emotion, specifically, f, mri, studies, have, provided, evidence, for, the, activation, of, the, insula, in, disgust, recognition, as, well, as, visceral, changes, in, disgust, reactions, such, as, the, feeling, of, nausea, the, importance, of, disgust, recognition, and, the, visceral, reaction, of, feeling, disgusted, is, evident, when, considering, the, survival, of, organisms, and, the, evolutionary, benefit, of, avoiding, contamination, the, insula, or, insular, cortex, is, the, main, neural, structure, involved, in, the, emotion, of, disgust, the, insula, has, been, shown, by, several, studies, to, be, the, main, neural, correlate, of, the, feeling, of, disgust, both, in, humans, and, in, macaque, monkeys, the, insula, is, activated, by, unpleasant, tastes, smells, and, the, visual, recognition, of, disgust, in, conspecific, organisms, the, anterior, insula, is, an, olfactory, and, gustatory, center, that, controls, visceral, sensations, and, the, related, autonomic, responses, it, also, receives, visual, information, from, the, anterior, portion, of, the, ventral, superior, temporal, cortex, where, cells, have, been, found, to, respond, to, the, sight, of, faces, the, posterior, insula, is, characterized, by, connections, with, auditory, somatosensory, and, premotor, areas, and, is, not, related, to, the, olfactory, or, gustatory, modalities, the, fact, that, the, insula, is, necessary, for, our, ability, to, feel, and, recognize, the, emotion, of, disgust, is, further, supported, by, neuropsychological, studies, both, calder, 2000, and, adolphs, 2003, showed, that, lesions, on, the, anterior, insula, lead, to, deficits, in, the, experience, of, disgust, and, recognizing, facial, expressions, of, disgust, in, others, the, patients, also, reported, having, reduced, sensations, of, disgust, themselves, furthermore, electrical, stimulation, of, the, anterior, insula, conducted, during, neurosurgery, triggered, nausea, the, feeling, of, wanting, to, throw, up, and, uneasiness, in, the, stomach, finally, electrically, stimulating, the, anterior, insula, through, implanted, electrodes, produced, sensations, in, the, throat, and, mouth, that, were, difficult, to, stand, these, findings, demonstrate, the, role, of, the, insula, in, transforming, unpleasant, sensory, input, into, physiological, reactions, and, the, associated, feeling, of, disgust, studies, have, demonstrated, that, the, insula, is, activated, by, disgusting, stimuli, and, that, observing, someone, else, s, facial, expression, of, disgust, seems, to, automatically, retrieve, a, neural, representation, of, disgust, furthermore, these, findings, emphasize, the, role, of, the, insula, in, feelings, of, disgust, one, particular, neuropsychological, study, focused, on, patient, nk, who, was, diagnosed, with, a, left, hemisphere, infarction, involving, the, insula, internal, capsule, putamen, and, globus, pallidus, nk, s, neural, damage, included, the, insula, and, putamen, and, it, was, found, that, nk, s, overall, response, to, disgust, inducing, stimuli, was, significantly, lower, than, that, of, controls, the, patient, showed, a, reduction, in, disgust, response, on, eight, categories, including, food, animals, body, products, envelope, violation, and, death, moreover, nk, incorrectly, categorized, disgust, facial, expressions, as, anger, the, results, of, this, study, support, the, idea, that, nk, had, damage, to, a, system, involved, in, recognizing, social, signals, of, disgust, due, to, a, damaged, insula, caused, by, neurodegeneration, many, patients, with, huntington, s, disease, a, genetically, transmitted, progressive, neurodegenerative, disease, are, unable, to, recognize, expressions, of, disgust, in, others, and, also, don, t, show, reactions, of, disgust, to, foul, odors, or, tastes, the, inability, to, recognize, expressions, of, disgust, appears, in, carriers, of, the, huntington, gene, before, other, symptoms, appear, people, with, huntington, s, disease, are, impaired, at, recognition, of, anger, and, fear, and, experience, a, notably, severe, problem, with, disgust, recognition, patients, with, major, depression, have, been, found, to, display, greater, brain, activation, to, facial, expressions, of, disgust, self, disgust, which, is, disgust, directed, towards, one, s, own, actions, may, also, contribute, to, the, relationship, between, dysfunctional, thoughts, and, depression, the, emotion, of, disgust, may, have, an, important, role, in, understanding, the, neurobiology, of, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, particularly, in, those, with, contamination, preoccupations, in, a, study, by, shapira, colleagues, 2003, eight, ocd, subjects, with, contamination, preoccupations, and, eight, healthy, volunteers, viewed, pictures, from, the, international, affective, picture, system, during, f, mri, scans, ocd, subjects, showed, significantly, greater, neural, responses, to, disgust, invoking, images, specifically, in, the, right, insula, furthermore, sprengelmeyer, 1997, found, that, the, brain, activation, associated, with, disgust, included, the, insula, and, part, of, the, gustatory, cortex, that, processes, unpleasant, tastes, and, smells, ocd, subjects, and, healthy, volunteers, showed, activation, patterns, in, response, to, disgust, pictures, that, differed, significantly, at, the, right, insula, in, contrast, the, two, groups, were, similar, in, their, response, to, threat, inducing, pictures, with, no, significant, group, differences, at, any, site, with, respect, to, studies, using, rats, prior, research, of, signs, of, a, conditioned, disgust, response, have, been, experimentally, verified, by, grill, and, norgren, 1978, who, developed, a, systematic, test, to, assess, palatability, the, taste, reactivity, tr, test, has, thus, become, a, standard, tool, in, measuring, disgust, response, when, given, a, stimulus, intraorally, which, had, been, previously, paired, with, a, nausea, inducing, substance, rats, will, show, conditioned, disgust, reactions, gaping, in, rats, is, the, most, dominant, conditioned, disgust, reaction, and, the, muscles, used, in, this, response, mimic, those, used, in, species, capable, of, vomiting, studies, have, shown, that, treatments, that, reduced, serotonin, availability, or, that, activate, the, endocannabinoid, system, can, interfere, with, the, expression, of, a, conditioned, disgust, reaction, in, rats, these, researchers, showed, that, as, nausea, produced, conditioned, disgust, reactions, by, administering, the, rats, with, an, antinausea, treatment, they, could, prevent, toxin, induced, conditioned, disgust, reactions, furthermore, in, looking, at, the, different, disgust, and, vomiting, reactions, between, rats, and, shrews, the, authors, showed, that, these, reactions, particularly, vomiting, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, associative, processes, that, govern, food, selection, across, species, in, discussing, specific, neural, locations, of, disgust, research, has, shown, that, forebrain, mechanisms, are, necessary, for, rats, to, acquire, conditioned, disgust, for, a, specific, emetic, vomit, inducing, substance, such, as, lithium, chloride, other, studies, have, shown, that, lesions, to, the, area, postrema, and, the, parabrachial, nucleus, of, the, pons, but, not, the, nucleus, of, the, solitary, tract, prevented, conditioned, disgust, moreover, lesions, of, the, dorsal, and, medial, raphe, nuclei, depleting, forebrain, serotonin, prevented, the, establishment, of, lithium, chloride, induced, conditioned, disgust, non, human, primates, display, signs, of, disgust, and, aversion, to, biological, contaminants, exposure, to, bodily, excrements, that, usually, elicit, disgust, reactions, in, humans, such, as, feces, semen, or, blood, have, an, impact, on, primates, feeding, preferences, chimpanzees, generally, avoid, the, smells, of, biological, contaminants, but, only, show, a, weak, tendency, to, move, away, from, these, odors, possibly, because, olfactory, stimuli, are, not, enough, to, give, chimps, a, high, enough, threat, level, to, move, away, chimpanzees, physically, recoil, when, presented, with, food, items, on, soft, moist, substrates, possibly, because, in, nature, moisture, softness, and, warmth, are, characteristics, needed, to, grow, pathogens, these, responses, are, functionally, similar, to, what, humans, responses, would, be, to, the, same, kinds, of, stimuli, indicating, that, the, underlying, mechanism, for, this, behavior, is, similar, to, ours, chimpanzees, generally, avoid, food, contaminated, with, dirt, or, feces, but, most, individuals, still, consume, these, kinds, of, contaminated, foods, while, chimps, do, show, a, preference, for, food, items, with, lower, contamination, risk, they, do, not, avoid, risk, altogether, as, most, humans, would, this, may, be, due, to, a, trade, off, between, the, nutritional, value, of, the, food, items, and, the, risk, of, infection, from, the, biological, contaminants, with, the, chimps, weighing, the, benefit, of, the, food, more, heavily, than, the, risk, of, contamination, in, contrast, to, chimpanzees, japanese, macaques, are, more, sensitive, to, visual, cues, of, contaminants, when, there, is, no, accompanying, odor, bonobos, are, most, sensitive, to, fecal, odors, and, rotten, food, odors, overall, primates, incorporate, various, senses, in, their, feeding, decisions, with, disgust, being, an, adaptive, trait, that, helps, them, avoid, potential, parasites, and, other, threats, from, contaminants, the, most, frequently, reported, disgust, like, behavior, in, non, human, primates, is, expelling, bad, tasting, food, items, but, even, this, behavior, is, not, very, common, this, might, be, because, primates, effectively, avoid, potentially, bad, tasting, food, items, and, food, that, is, avoided, cannot, be, expelled, hence, the, low, observation, rate, of, this, behavior, primates, notably, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, occasionally, make, facial, expressions, such, as, grimacing, and, tongue, protrusions, after, having, bad, tasting, food, individual, primate, preferences, vary, widely, some, tolerating, extremely, bitter, food, while, others, are, more, particular, taste, preferences, are, more, often, noticed, in, high, ranking, individuals, likely, because, lower, ranked, individuals, may, have, to, tolerate, less, desired, foods, while, in, humans, there, is, a, strong, difference, in, disgust, reactions, between, the, two, sexes, this, difference, has, not, been, documented, in, non, human, primates, in, humans, women, generally, report, greater, disgust, than, men, in, bonobos, and, chimps, females, are, not, any, more, avoidant, than, males, of, contamination, risk, there, is, some, evidence, suggesting, that, juveniles, are, less, contamination, risk, avoidant, than, adults, which, is, in, line, with, research, on, the, development, of, the, disgust, response, in, humans, coprophagy, is, commonly, observed, in, chimpanzees, possibly, suggesting, that, chimps, do, not, really, have, a, disgust, mechanism, the, way, humans, do, coprophagy, is, usually, only, done, to, re, ingest, seeds, from, one, s, own, feces, which, is, less, risky, than, ingesting, others, feces, in, terms, of, exposure, to, new, parasites, additionally, chimps, often, use, leaves, and, twigs, to, wipe, themselves, when, they, stepped, in, others, feces, instead, of, removing, it, with, their, bare, hands, great, apes, almost, always, remove, feces, from, their, bodies, after, accidentally, stepping, in, it, even, in, instances, where, it, would, be, beneficial, to, wait, for, example, when, grapes, are, being, passed, out, to, chimps, and, they, accidentally, step, in, feces, they, almost, always, take, the, time, to, stop, and, wipe, it, off, even, if, it, means, missing, out, on, food, unlike, in, humans, the, avoidance, of, social, contamination, ex, staying, away, from, sick, conspecifics, is, rare, in, great, apes, instead, great, apes, often, groom, sick, conspecifics, or, just, treat, them, with, indifference, additionally, great, apes, treat, products, of, a, sick, conspecific, such, as, mucus, or, blood, with, interest, or, indifference, this, is, in, contrast, with, human, disease, avoidance, where, avoiding, those, who, appear, sick, is, a, key, feature, taken, together, studies, on, the, disgust, reaction, in, primates, show, that, disgust, is, adaptive, in, primates, and, that, the, avoidance, of, potential, sources, of, pathogens, is, triggered, by, the, same, contaminants, as, for, humans, the, adaptive, problems, that, primates, faced, did, not, align, to, the, degree, that, they, did, for, early, humans, which, is, why, disgust, manifests, differently, in, humans, and, non, human, primates, differences, in, disgust, responses, between, humans, and, non, human, primates, likely, reflects, their, unique, ecological, standpoints, rather, than, disgust, being, a, unique, human, emotion, disgust, is, a, continuation, of, the, parasite, and, infection, avoidance, behavior, found, in, all, animals, one, theory, explaining, the, difference, is, that, since, primates, are, largely, foragers, and, never, shifted, to, the, hunter, scavenger, lifestyle, with, a, diet, high, in, meat, they, were, never, exposed, to, the, new, wave, of, pathogens, that, humans, were, exposed, to, as, well, as, the, selection, pressures, that, would, come, with, this, diet, therefore, the, disgust, mechanisms, in, primates, remained, muted, only, strong, enough, to, address, the, distinct, problems, primates, faced, in, their, evolutionary, history, additionally, disgust, like, behavior, in, great, apes, should, be, lower, than, in, humans, because, they, live, in, less, hygienic, conditions, humans, clean, habits, over, generations, has, reduced, how, frequently, we, are, exposed, to, disgust, elicitors, and, has, likely, expanded, the, stimuli, that, would, elicit, disgust, reactions, in, us, great, apes, on, the, other, hand, are, constantly, exposed, to, disgust, elicitors, leading, to, habituation, and, a, muted, form, of, disgust, compared, to, modern, humans, although, disgust, was, first, thought, to, be, a, motivation, for, humans, to, only, physical, contaminants, it, has, since, been, applied, to, moral, and, social, moral, contaminants, as, well, the, similarities, between, these, types, of, disgust, can, especially, be, seen, in, the, way, people, react, to, the, contaminants, for, example, if, someone, stumbles, upon, a, pool, of, vomit, they, will, do, whatever, possible, to, place, as, much, distance, between, themselves, and, the, vomit, as, possible, which, can, include, pinching, the, nose, closing, the, eyes, or, running, away, likewise, when, a, group, experiences, someone, who, cheats, rapes, or, murders, another, member, of, the, group, its, reaction, is, to, shun, or, expel, that, person, from, the, group, arguably, there, is, a, completely, different, construct, of, the, emotion, of, disgust, from, the, core, disgust, that, can, be, seen, in, ekman, s, basic, emotions, socio, moral, disgust, occurs, when, social, or, moral, boundaries, appear, to, be, violated, the, socio, moral, aspect, centers, on, human, violations, of, the, autonomy, and, dignity, of, others, e, g, racism, hypocrisy, disloyalty, socio, moral, disgust, is, different, from, core, disgust, in, the, 2006, study, done, by, simpson, and, colleagues, there, was, a, divergence, found, in, disgust, responses, between, the, core, elicitors, of, disgust, and, the, socio, moral, elicitors, of, disgust, suggesting, that, the, makeup, of, core, and, socio, moral, disgust, may, be, different, emotional, constructs, studies, have, found, that, disgust, has, been, known, to, predict, prejudice, and, discrimination, through, passive, viewing, tasks, and, functional, magnetic, resonance, researchers, were, able, to, provide, direct, evidence, that, the, insula, is, largely, involved, in, racially, biased, perception, of, facial, disgust, through, two, distinct, neural, pathways, amygdala, and, insula, both, areas, of, the, brain, that, deal, with, emotion, processing, it, was, found, that, racial, prejudice, elicited, disgusted, facial, expressions, disgust, can, also, predict, prejudice, and, discrimination, towards, individuals, with, obesity, vertanian, trewartha, and, vanman, 2016, showed, participants, photos, of, obese, targets, and, non, obese, targets, performing, everyday, activities, they, found, that, compared, to, non, obese, people, obese, targets, elicited, more, disgust, more, negative, attitudes, and, stereotypes, and, a, greater, desire, for, a, social, distance, from, participants, jones, fitness, 2008, coined, the, term, moral, hypervigilance, to, describe, the, phenomenon, that, individuals, who, are, prone, to, physical, disgust, are, also, prone, to, moral, disgust, the, link, between, physical, disgust, and, moral, disgust, can, be, seen, in, the, united, states, where, criminals, are, often, referred, to, as, slime, or, scum, and, criminal, activity, as, stinking, or, being, fishy, furthermore, people, often, try, to, block, out, the, stimuli, of, morally, repulsive, images, in, much, the, same, way, that, they, would, block, out, the, stimuli, of, a, physically, repulsive, image, when, people, see, an, image, of, abuse, rape, or, murder, they, often, avert, their, gazes, to, inhibit, the, incoming, visual, stimuli, from, the, photograph, just, like, they, would, if, they, saw, a, decomposing, body, moral, judgments, can, be, traditionally, defined, or, thought, of, as, directed, by, standards, such, as, impartiality, and, respect, towards, others, for, their, well, being, from, more, recent, theoretical, and, empirical, information, it, can, be, suggested, that, morality, may, be, guided, by, basic, affective, processes, jonathan, haidt, proposed, that, one, s, instant, judgments, about, morality, are, experienced, as, a, flash, of, intuition, and, that, these, affective, perceptions, operate, rapidly, associatively, and, outside, of, consciousness, from, this, moral, intuitions, are, believed, to, be, stimulated, prior, to, conscious, moral, cognitions, which, correlates, with, having, a, greater, influence, on, moral, judgments, research, suggests, that, the, experience, of, disgust, can, alter, moral, judgments, many, studies, have, focused, on, the, average, change, in, behavior, across, participants, with, some, studies, indicating, disgust, stimuli, intensifies, the, severity, of, moral, judgments, later, studies, found, the, reverse, effect, and, some, studies, have, suggested, that, the, average, effect, of, disgust, on, moral, judgments, is, small, or, absent, potentially, reconciling, these, effects, one, study, indicated, that, the, direction, and, size, of, the, effect, of, disgust, stimuli, on, moral, judgment, depends, upon, an, individual, s, sensitivity, to, disgust, one, effort, to, reconcile, the, inconsistent, findings, suggests, that, studying, the, effects, of, induced, disgust, on, moral, judgments, alone, is, insufficient, instead, the, magnitude, of, experienced, disgust, appears, to, be, a, critical, factor, research, by, bia, ek, et, al, found, that, self, reported, levels, of, disgust, were, more, predictive, of, changes, in, moral, judgments, than, the, mere, presence, of, disgust, elicitors, this, approach, may, provide, a, more, nuanced, understanding, of, how, disgust, influences, moral, decision, making, the, effect, also, seems, to, be, limited, to, a, certain, aspect, of, morality, horberg, et, al, found, that, disgust, plays, a, role, in, the, development, and, intensification, of, moral, judgments, of, purity, in, particular, in, other, words, the, feeling, of, disgust, is, often, associated, with, a, feeling, that, some, image, of, what, is, pure, has, been, violated, for, example, a, vegetarian, might, feel, disgust, after, seeing, another, person, eating, meat, because, he, she, has, a, view, of, vegetarianism, as, the, pure, state, of, being, when, this, state, of, being, is, violated, the, vegetarian, feels, disgust, furthermore, disgust, appears, to, be, uniquely, associated, with, purity, judgments, not, with, what, is, just, unjust, or, what, is, harmful, caregiving, while, other, emotions, such, as, fear, anger, and, sadness, are, unrelated, to, moral, judgments, of, purity, some, other, research, suggests, that, an, individual, s, level, of, disgust, sensitivity, is, due, to, their, particular, experience, of, disgust, one, s, disgust, sensitivity, can, be, either, high, or, low, the, higher, one, s, disgust, sensitivity, is, the, greater, the, tendency, to, make, stricter, moral, judgments, disgust, sensitivity, can, also, relate, to, various, aspects, of, moral, values, which, can, have, a, negative, or, positive, impact, for, example, disgust, sensitivity, is, associated, with, moral, hypervigilance, which, means, people, who, have, higher, disgust, sensitivity, are, more, likely, to, think, that, other, people, who, are, suspects, of, a, crime, are, more, guilty, they, also, associate, them, as, being, morally, evil, and, criminal, thus, endorsing, them, to, harsher, punishment, in, the, setting, of, a, court, disgust, is, also, theorized, as, an, evaluative, emotion, that, can, control, moral, behavior, when, one, experiences, disgust, this, emotion, might, signal, that, certain, behaviors, objects, or, people, are, to, be, avoided, in, order, to, preserve, their, purity, research, has, established, that, when, the, idea, or, concept, of, cleanliness, is, made, salient, then, people, make, less, severe, moral, judgments, of, others, from, this, particular, finding, it, can, be, suggested, that, this, reduces, the, experience, of, disgust, and, the, ensuing, threat, of, psychological, impurity, diminishes, the, apparent, severity, of, moral, transgressions, in, one, study, people, of, differing, political, persuasions, were, shown, disgusting, images, in, a, brain, scanner, in, conservatives, the, basal, ganglia, and, amygdala, and, several, other, regions, showed, increased, activity, while, in, liberals, other, regions, of, the, brain, increased, in, activity, both, groups, reported, similar, conscious, reactions, to, the, images, the, difference, in, activity, patterns, was, large, the, reaction, to, a, single, image, could, predict, a, person, s, political, leanings, with, 95, accuracy, later, however, such, results, have, been, proven, to, be, mixed, with, failed, replications, and, questions, about, what, is, actually, being, measured, also, raising, questions, about, the, generalizability, of, the, findings, although, limited, research, has, been, done, on, self, disgust, one, study, found, that, self, disgust, and, severity, of, moral, judgments, were, negatively, correlated, this, is, in, contrast, to, findings, related, to, disgust, which, typically, results, in, harsher, judgments, of, transgressions, this, implies, that, disgust, directed, towards, the, self, functions, very, differently, from, disgust, directed, towards, other, people, or, objects, self, disgust, may, reflect, a, pervasive, condition, of, self, loathing, that, makes, it, difficult, to, assign, deserving, punishment, to, others, in, other, words, those, who, feel, self, disgust, cannot, easily, condemn, others, to, punishment, because, they, feel, that, they, may, also, be, deserving, of, punishment, the, concept, of, self, disgust, has, been, implicated, in, several, mental, health, conditions, including, depression, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, and, eating, disorders, the, emotion, of, disgust, can, be, described, to, serve, as, an, effective, mechanism, following, occurrences, of, negative, social, value, provoking, repulsion, and, desire, for, social, distance, the, origin, of, disgust, can, be, defined, by, motivating, the, avoidance, of, offensive, things, and, in, the, context, of, a, social, environment, it, can, become, an, instrument, of, social, avoidance, an, example, of, disgust, in, action, can, be, found, from, the, bible, in, the, book, of, leviticus, see, especially, leviticus, chapter, 11, leviticus, includes, direct, commandments, from, god, to, avoid, disgust, causing, individuals, which, included, people, who, were, sexually, immoral, and, those, who, had, leprosy, disgust, is, known, to, promote, the, avoidance, of, pathogens, and, disease, as, an, effective, instrument, for, reducing, motivations, for, social, interaction, disgust, can, be, anticipated, to, interfere, with, dehumanization, or, the, maltreatment, of, persons, as, less, than, human, research, was, performed, which, conducted, several, functional, magnetic, resonance, images, fmri, in, which, participants, viewed, images, of, individuals, from, stigmatized, groups, that, were, associated, with, disgust, which, were, drug, addicts, and, homeless, people, what, the, study, found, was, that, people, were, not, inclined, in, making, inferences, about, the, mental, conditions, of, these, particular, disgust, inducing, groups, therefore, examining, images, of, homeless, people, and, drug, addicts, caused, disgust, in, the, response, of, the, people, who, participated, with, this, study, this, study, coincides, with, disgust, following, the, law, of, contagion, which, explains, that, contact, with, disgusting, material, renders, one, disgusting, disgust, can, be, applied, towards, people, and, can, function, as, maltreatment, towards, another, human, being, disgust, can, exclude, people, from, being, a, part, of, a, clique, by, leading, to, the, view, that, they, are, merely, less, than, human, an, example, of, this, is, if, groups, were, to, avoid, people, from, outside, of, their, own, particular, group, some, researchers, have, distinguished, between, two, different, forms, of, dehumanization, the, first, form, is, the, denial, of, uniquely, human, traits, examples, include, products, of, culture, and, modification, the, second, form, is, the, denial, of, human, nature, examples, include, emotionality, and, personality, failure, to, attribute, distinctively, human, traits, to, a, group, leads, to, animalistic, dehumanization, which, defines, the, object, group, or, individual, as, savage, crude, and, similar, to, animals, these, forms, of, dehumanization, have, clear, connections, to, disgust, researchers, have, proposed, that, many, disgust, elicitors, are, disgusting, because, they, are, reminders, that, humans, are, not, diverse, from, other, creatures, with, the, aid, of, disgust, animalistic, dehumanization, directly, reduces, one, s, moral, concerns, towards, excluding, members, from, the, outer, group, disgust, can, be, a, cause, and, consequence, of, dehumanization, animalistic, dehumanization, may, generate, feelings, of, disgust, and, revulsion, feelings, of, disgust, through, rousing, social, distance, may, lead, to, dehumanization, therefore, a, person, or, group, that, is, generally, connected, with, disgusting, effects, and, seen, as, physically, unclean, may, induce, moral, avoidance, being, deemed, disgusting, produces, a, variety, of, cognitive, effects, that, result, in, exclusion, from, the, perceived, inner, group, the, emotion, disgust, has, been, noted, to, feature, strongly, in, the, public, sphere, in, relation, to, issues, and, debates, among, other, things, regarding, anatomy, sex, and, bioethics, there, is, a, range, of, views, by, different, commentators, on, the, role, purpose, and, effects, of, disgust, on, public, discourse, leon, kass, a, bioethicist, has, advocated, that, in, crucial, cases, repugnance, is, the, emotional, expression, of, deep, wisdom, beyond, reason, s, power, fully, to, articulate, it, in, relation, to, bio, ethical, issues, see, wisdom, of, repugnance, martha, nussbaum, a, jurist, and, ethicist, explicitly, rejects, disgust, as, an, appropriate, guide, for, legislating, arguing, the, politics, of, disgust, is, an, unreliable, emotional, reaction, with, no, inherent, wisdom, furthermore, she, argues, this, politics, of, disgust, has, in, the, past, and, present, had, the, effects, of, supporting, bigotry, in, the, forms, of, sexism, racism, and, antisemitism, and, links, the, emotion, of, disgust, to, support, for, laws, against, miscegenation, and, the, oppressive, caste, system, in, india, in, place, of, this, politics, of, disgust, nussbaum, argues, for, the, harm, principle, from, john, stuart, mill, as, the, proper, basis, for, legislating, nussbaum, argues, the, harm, principle, supports, the, legal, ideas, of, consent, the, age, of, majority, and, privacy, and, protects, citizens, she, contrasts, this, with, the, politics, of, disgust, which, she, argues, denies, citizens, humanity, and, equality, before, the, law, on, no, rational, grounds, and, cause, palpable, social, harm, see, martha, nussbaum, from, disgust, to, humanity, sexual, orientation, and, constitutional, law, nussbaum, published, hiding, from, humanity, disgust, shame, and, the, law, in, 2004, the, book, examines, the, relationship, of, disgust, and, shame, to, a, society, s, laws, nussbaum, identifies, disgust, as, a, marker, that, bigoted, and, often, merely, majoritarian, discourse, employs, to, place, by, diminishment, and, denigration, a, despised, minority, removing, disgust, from, public, discourse, constitutes, an, important, step, in, achieving, humane, and, tolerant, democracies, leigh, turner, 2004, has, argued, that, reactions, of, disgust, are, often, built, upon, prejudices, that, should, be, challenged, and, rebutted, on, the, other, hand, writers, such, as, kass, find, wisdom, in, adhering, to, one, s, initial, feelings, of, disgust, a, number, of, writers, on, the, theory, of, disgust, find, it, to, be, the, proto, legal, foundation, of, human, law, disgust, has, also, figured, prominently, in, the, work, of, several, other, philosophers, nietzsche, became, disgusted, with, the, music, and, orientation, of, richard, wagner, as, well, as, other, aspects, of, 19th, century, culture, and, morality, jean, paul, sartre, wrote, widely, about, experiences, involving, various, negative, emotions, related, to, disgust, according, to, the, book, the, hydra, s, tale, imagining, disgust, by, robert, rawdon, wilson, disgust, may, be, further, subdivided, into, physical, disgust, associated, with, physical, or, metaphorical, uncleanliness, and, moral, disgust, a, similar, feeling, related, to, courses, of, action, for, example, i, am, disgusted, by, the, hurtful, things, that, you, are, saying, moral, disgust, should, be, understood, as, culturally, determined, physical, disgust, as, more, universally, grounded, the, book, also, discusses, moral, disgust, as, an, aspect, of, the, representation, of, disgust, wilson, does, this, in, two, ways, first, he, discusses, representations, of, disgust, in, literature, film, and, fine, art, since, there, are, characteristic, facial, expressions, the, clenched, nostrils, the, pursed, lips, as, charles, darwin, paul, ekman, and, others, have, shown, they, may, be, represented, with, more, or, less, skill, in, any, set, of, circumstances, imaginable, there, may, even, be, disgust, worlds, in, which, disgust, motifs, so, dominate, that, it, may, seem, that, entire, represented, world, is, in, itself, disgusting, second, since, people, know, what, disgust, is, as, a, primary, or, visceral, emotion, with, characteristic, gestures, and, expressions, they, may, imitate, it, thus, wilson, argues, that, for, example, contempt, is, acted, out, on, the, basis, of, the, visceral, emotion, disgust, but, is, not, identical, with, disgust, it, is, a, compound, affect, that, entails, intellectual, preparation, or, formatting, and, theatrical, techniques, wilson, argues, that, there, are, many, such, intellectual, compound, affects, such, as, nostalgia, and, outrage, but, that, disgust, is, a, fundamental, and, unmistakable, example, moral, disgust, then, is, different, from, visceral, disgust, it, is, more, conscious, and, more, layered, in, performance, wilson, links, shame, and, guilt, to, disgust, now, transformed, wholly, or, partially, into, self, disgust, primarily, as, a, consequence, rooted, in, self, consciousness, referring, to, a, passage, in, doris, lessing, s, the, golden, notebook, wilson, writes, that, the, dance, between, disgust, and, shame, takes, place, a, slow, choreography, unfolds, before, the, mind, s, eye, wilson, examines, the, claims, of, several, jurists, and, legal, scholars, such, as, william, ian, miller, that, disgust, must, underlie, positive, law, in, the, absence, of, disgust, he, observes, stating, their, claim, there, would, be, either, total, barbarism, or, a, society, ruled, solely, by, force, violence, and, terror, the, moral, legal, argument, he, remarks, leaves, much, out, of, account, his, own, argument, turns, largely, upon, the, human, capacity, to, learn, how, to, control, even, to, suppress, strong, and, problematic, affects, and, over, time, for, entire, populations, to, abandon, specific, disgust, responses, disgust, is, the, opposite, of, trust, on, the, emotion, wheel, a, mild, form, of, disgust, is, boredom, while, a, more, intense, version, is, loathing
