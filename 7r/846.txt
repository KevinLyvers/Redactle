a, eunuch, ju, n, k, yoo, n, k, is, a, male, who, has, been, castrated, throughout, history, castration, often, served, a, specific, social, function, the, earliest, records, for, intentional, castration, to, produce, eunuchs, are, from, the, sumerian, city, of, lagash, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, over, the, millennia, since, they, have, performed, a, wide, variety, of, functions, in, many, different, cultures, courtiers, or, equivalent, domestics, for, espionage, or, clandestine, operations, castrato, singers, concubines, or, sexual, partners, religious, specialists, soldiers, royal, guards, government, officials, and, guardians, of, women, or, harem, servants, eunuchs, would, usually, be, servants, or, slaves, who, had, been, castrated, to, make, them, less, threatening, servants, of, a, royal, court, where, physical, access, to, the, ruler, could, wield, great, influence, seemingly, lowly, domestic, functions, such, as, making, the, ruler, s, bed, bathing, him, cutting, his, hair, carrying, him, in, his, litter, or, even, relaying, messages, could, in, theory, give, a, eunuch, the, ruler, s, ear, and, impart, de, facto, power, on, the, formally, humble, but, trusted, servant, similar, instances, are, reflected, in, the, humble, origins, and, etymology, of, many, high, offices, eunuchs, supposedly, did, not, generally, have, loyalties, to, the, military, the, aristocracy, or, a, family, of, their, own, having, neither, offspring, nor, in, laws, at, the, very, least, they, were, thus, seen, as, more, trustworthy, and, less, interested, in, establishing, a, private, dynasty, because, their, condition, usually, lowered, their, social, status, they, could, also, be, easily, replaced, or, killed, without, repercussion, in, cultures, that, had, both, harems, and, eunuchs, eunuchs, were, sometimes, used, as, harem, servants, eunuchs, have, been, documented, in, several, ancient, and, medieval, societies, including, the, byzantine, empire, imperial, china, the, ottoman, empire, and, various, middle, eastern, cultures, they, often, held, significant, power, and, influence, in, these, societies, particularly, in, royal, courts, and, harems, eunuch, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, word, euno, khos, first, attested, in, a, fragment, of, hipponax, the, 6th, century, bce, comic, poet, and, prolific, inventor, of, compound, words, the, acerbic, poet, describes, a, particular, lover, of, fine, food, having, consumed, his, estate, dining, lavishly, and, at, leisure, every, day, on, tuna, and, garlic, honey, cheese, pat, like, a, lampsacene, eunoukhos, the, earliest, surviving, etymology, of, the, word, is, from, late, antiquity, the, 5th, century, ce, etymologicon, by, orion, of, thebes, offers, two, alternative, origins, for, the, word, eunuch, first, to, t, n, eun, n, ekhein, guarding, the, bed, a, derivation, inferred, from, eunuchs, established, role, at, the, time, as, bedchamber, attendants, in, the, imperial, palace, and, second, to, eu, tou, nou, ekhein, being, good, with, respect, to, the, mind, which, orion, explains, based, on, their, being, deprived, of, intercourse, ester, menou, tou, misgesthai, the, things, that, the, ancients, used, to, call, irrational, ano, ta, literally, mindless, orion, s, second, option, reflects, well, established, idioms, in, ancient, greek, as, shown, by, entries, for, transl, grc, transl, noos, eunoos, and, ekhein, in, liddell, and, scott, s, greek, english, lexicon, while, the, first, option, is, not, listed, as, an, idiom, under, eun, in, that, standard, reference, work, however, the, first, option, was, cited, by, the, late, 9th, century, byzantine, emperor, leo, vi, in, his, new, constitution, 98, banning, the, marriage, of, eunuchs, in, which, he, noted, eunuchs, reputation, as, trustworthy, guardians, of, the, marriage, bed, eun, and, claimed, that, the, very, word, eunuch, attested, to, this, kind, of, employment, the, emperor, also, goes, further, than, orion, by, attributing, eunuchs, lack, of, male, female, intercourse, specifically, to, castration, which, he, said, was, performed, with, the, intention, that, they, will, no, longer, do, the, things, that, males, do, or, at, least, to, extinguish, whatever, has, to, do, with, desire, for, the, female, sex, the, 11th, century, byzantine, monk, nikon, of, the, black, mountain, opting, instead, for, orion, s, second, alternative, stated, that, the, word, came, from, eunoein, eu, good, nous, mind, thus, meaning, to, be, well, minded, well, inclined, well, disposed, or, favorable, but, unlike, orion, he, argued, that, this, was, due, to, the, trust, that, certain, jealous, and, suspicious, foreign, rulers, placed, in, the, loyalty, of, their, eunuchized, servants, theophylact, of, ohrid, in, a, dialogue, in, defence, of, eunuchs, also, stated, that, the, origin, of, the, word, was, from, eupnoeic, and, ekhein, to, have, hold, since, they, were, always, well, disposed, toward, the, master, who, held, or, owned, them, the, 12th, century, etymologicum, magnum, s, v, eunoukhos, essentially, repeats, the, entry, from, orion, but, stands, by, the, first, option, while, attributing, the, second, option, to, what, some, say, in, the, late, 12th, century, eustathius, of, thessalonica, commentaries, on, homer, 1256, 30, 1643, 16, offered, an, original, derivation, of, the, word, from, eunis, okheuein, deprived, of, mating, in, translations, of, the, bible, into, modern, european, languages, such, as, the, luther, bible, or, the, king, james, bible, the, word, eunuchs, as, found, in, the, latin, vulgate, is, usually, rendered, as, an, officer, official, or, chamberlain, consistent, with, the, idea, that, the, original, meaning, of, eunuch, was, bed, keeper, orion, s, first, option, modern, religious, scholars, have, been, disinclined, to, assume, that, the, courts, of, israel, and, judah, included, castrated, men, even, though, the, original, translation, of, the, bible, into, greek, used, the, word, eunoukhos, the, early, 17th, century, scholar, and, theologian, gerardus, vossius, therefore, explains, that, the, word, originally, designated, an, office, and, he, affirms, the, view, that, it, was, derived, from, eun, and, ekhein, i, e, bed, keeper, he, says, the, word, came, to, be, applied, to, castrated, men, in, general, because, such, men, were, the, usual, holders, of, that, office, still, vossius, notes, the, alternative, etymologies, offered, by, eustathius, deprived, of, mating, and, others, having, the, mind, in, a, good, state, calling, these, analyses, quite, subtle, then, after, having, previously, declared, that, eunuch, designated, an, office, i, e, not, a, personal, characteristic, vossius, ultimately, sums, up, his, argument, in, a, different, way, saying, that, the, word, originally, signified, continent, men, to, whom, the, care, of, women, was, entrusted, and, later, came, to, refer, to, castration, because, among, foreigners, that, role, was, performed, by, those, with, mutilated, bodies, modern, etymologists, have, followed, orion, s, first, option, in, an, influential, 1925, essay, on, the, word, eunuch, and, related, terms, ernst, maass, suggested, that, eustathius, s, derivation, can, or, must, be, laid, to, rest, and, he, affirmed, the, derivation, from, eun, and, ekhein, guardian, of, the, bed, without, mentioning, the, other, derivation, from, eunoos, and, ekhein, having, a, well, disposed, state, of, mind, in, latin, the, words, eunuchus, spado, greek, spadon, and, castratus, were, used, to, denote, eunuchs, the, term, eunuch, has, sometimes, figuratively, been, used, for, a, wide, range, of, men, who, were, seen, to, be, physically, unable, to, procreate, hippocrates, describes, the, scythians, as, being, afflicted, with, high, rates, of, erectile, dysfunction, and, thus, the, most, eunuchoid, of, all, nations, airs, waters, places, 22, in, the, charlton, t, lewis, charles, short, a, latin, dictionary, the, term, literally, used, for, impotent, males, is, spado, but, may, also, be, used, for, eunuchs, some, men, have, falsified, the, status, of, their, castration, to, gain, entrance, into, the, palace, chinese, eunuch, lao, ai, for, instance, became, the, lover, of, the, mother, of, qin, shi, huang, who, bore, him, two, sons,

as, eunuchs, in, the, thai, palace, and, court, the, thai, at, times, asked, eunuchs, from, china, to, visit, the, court, in, thailand, and, advise, them, on, court, ritual, since, they, held, them, in, high, regard, in, imperial, china, eunuchs, managed, the, imperial, household, and, were, involved, in, state, affairs, often, wielding, significant, political, power, sir, henry, yule, saw, many, muslims, serving, as, eunuchs, during, the, konbaung, dynasty, period, of, burma, modern, myanmar, while, on, a, diplomatic, mission, in, china, castration, included, removal, of, the, penis, as,

by, 3, 000, years, ago, and, were, common, as, civil, servants, by, the, time, of, the, qin, dynasty, from, those, ancient, times, until, the, sui, dynasty, castration, was, both, a, traditional, punishment, one, of, the, five, punishments, and, a, means, of, gaining, employment, in, the, imperial, service, certain, eunuchs, such, as, the, ming, dynasty, official, zheng, he, gained, immense, power, that, occasionally, superseded, that, of, even, the, grand, secretaries, self, castration, was, a, common, practice, although, it, was, not, always, performed, completely, which, led, to, it, being, made, illegal, it, is, said, that, the, justification, for, the, employment, of, eunuchs, as, high, ranking, civil, servants, was, that, since, they, were, incapable, of, having, children, they, would, not, be, tempted, to, seize, power, and, start, a, dynasty, in, many, cases, eunuchs, were, considered, more, reliable, than, the, scholar, officials, as, a, symbolic, assignment, of, heavenly, authority, to, the, palace, system, a, constellation, of, stars, was, designated, as, the, emperor, s, and, to, the, west, of, it, four, stars, were, identified, as, his, eunuchs, the, tension, between, eunuchs, in, the, service, of, the, emperor, and, virtuous, confucian, officials, is, a, familiar, theme, in, chinese, history, in, his, history, of, government, samuel, finer, points, out, that, reality, was, not, always, that, clear, cut, there, were, instances, of, very, capable, eunuchs, who, were, valuable, advisers, to, their, emperor, and, the, resistance, of, the, virtuous, officials, often, stemmed, from, jealousy, on, their, part, ray, huang, argues, that, in, reality, eunuchs, represented, the, personal, will, of, the, emperor, while, the, officials, represented, the, alternative, political, will, of, the, bureaucracy, the, clash, between, them, would, thus, have, been, a, clash, of, ideologies, or, political, agenda, the, number, of, eunuchs, in,

debate, the, early, theologian, origen, found, evidence, of, the, practice, in, matthew, 19, 10, 12, his, disciples, said, to, him, if, such, is, the, case, of, a, man, with, his, wife, it, is, better, not, to, marry, but, he, said, to, them, not, everyone, can, accept, this, teaching, but, only, those, to, whom, it, is, given, for, there, are, eunuchs, who, have, been, so, from, birth, and, there, are, eunuchs, who, have, been, made, eunuchs, by, others, and, there, are, eunuchs, who, have, made, themselves, eunuchs, for, the, sake, of, the, kingdom, of, heaven, let, anyone, accept,

from, the, cited, book, tertullian, takes, spado, to, mean, virgin, the, meaning, of, spado, in, late, antiquity, can, be, interpreted, as, a, metaphor, for, celibacy, tertullian, even, goes, so, far, with, the, metaphor, as, to, say, st, paul, had, been, castrated, tertullian, also, ridiculed, his, theological, opponent, marcion, of, sinope, as, a, eunuch, who, advocated, for, sexual, abstinence,

flesh, several, members, of, the, 20th, century, heaven, s, gate, cult, were, found, to, have, been, castrated, apparently, voluntarily, and, for, the, same, reasons, wherefore, they, are, no, more, twain, but, one, flesh, what, therefore, god, hath, joined, together, let, not, man, put, asunder, they, say, unto, him, why, did, moses, then, command, to, give, a, writing, of, divorcement, and, to, put, her, away, he, saith, unto, them, moses, because, of, the, hardness, of, your, hearts, suffered, you, to, put, away, your, wives, but, from, the, beginning, it, was, not, so, and, i, say, unto, you, whosoever, shall, put, away, his, wife, except, for, fornication, and, shall, marry, another, committeth, adultery, and, whoso, marrieth, her, which, is, put, away, doth, commit, adultery, his, disciples, say, unto, him, if, the, case, of, the, man, be, so, with, wife, it, is, not, good, to, marry, but, he, said, unto, them, all, cannot, receive, this, saying, save, to, whom, it, is, given, for, there, are, some, eunuchs, which, were, so, born, from, mother, s, womb, and, there, are, some, eunuchs, which, were, made, eunuchs, of, men, and, there, be, eunuchs, which, have, made, themselves, eunuchs, for, the, kingdom, of, heaven, s, sake, he, that, is, able, to, receive, let, him, receive, the, reference, to, eunuchs, in, matthew, 19, 12, has, yielded, various, interpretations, one, of, the, earliest, converts, to, christianity, was, an, ethiopian, eunuch, who, was, a, high, court, official, of, candace, the, queen, of, ethiopia, but, was, already, a, eunuch, at, the, time, of, conversion, acts, 8, 27, 39, eunuchs, are, mentioned, many, times, in, the, bible, such, as, in, the, book, of, isaiah, 56, 4, using, the, word, saris, although, the, ancient, hebrews, did, not, practice, castration, eunuchs, were, common, in, other, cultures, featured, in, the, bible, such, as, ancient, egypt, assyria, and, babylonia, the, achaemenid, empire, and, ancient, rome, in, the, book, of, esther, servants, of, the, persian, harem, of, ahasuerus, such, as, hegai, and, shashgaz, as, well, as, other, servants, such, as, hatach, harbonah, bigthan, and, teresh, are, referred, to, as, sarisim, being, exposed, to, the, consorts, of, the, king, they, would, likely, have, been, castrated, the, hebrew, word, saris, hebrew, romanized, s, ris, derives, from, a, r, i, the, akkadian, word, for, eunuch, and, thus, has, been, generally, understood, by, scholars, as, referring, to, eunuchs, however, its, technical, meaning, is, a, male, who, has, not, shown, signs, of, typical, sexual, maturity, by, the, age, of, 20, per, the, talmud, only, one, known, as, a, saris, adam, a, castrated, male, one, made, sterile, intentionally, or, via, accidental, injury, might, be, considered, a, eunuch, a, saris, ama, is, one, who, is, congenitally, sterile, and, is, not, considered, a, eunuch, the, role, of, eunuchs, in, society, was, often, dictated, by, social, and, cultural, norms, as, well, as, political, necessities, for, instance, eunuchs, were, seen, as, reliable, because, they, could, not, produce, heirs, and, thus, were, considered, less, likely, to, establish, rival, power, bases, the, practice, of, castration, was, often, a, means, of, ensuring, loyalty, and, controlling, certain, populations, eunuchs, castrated, before, puberty, were, also, valued, and, trained, in, several, cultures, for, their, exceptional, voices, which, retained, a, childlike, and, other, worldly, flexibility, and, treble, pitch, a, high, pitched, voice, such, eunuchs, were, known, as, castrati, as, women, were, sometimes, forbidden, to, sing, in, church, their, place, was, taken, by, castrati, castrati, became, very, popular, in, 18th, century,
