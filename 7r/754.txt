worthlessness, shame, is, a, discrete, basic, emotion, described, as, a, moral, or, social, emotion, that, drives, people, to, hide, or, deny, their, wrongdoings, moral, emotions, are, emotions, that,

perceived, audience, it, can, bring, about, profound, feelings, of, deficiency, defeat, inferiority, unworthiness, or, self, loathing, our, attention, turns, inward, we, isolate, from, our, surroundings, and, withdraw, into, closed, off, self, absorption, not, only, do, we, feel, alienated, from, others, but, also, from, the, healthy, parts, of, ourselves, the, alienation, from, the, world, is, replaced, with, painful, emotions, and, self, deprecating, thoughts, and, inner, anguish, empirical, research, demonstrates, that, it, is, dysfunctional, for, the, individual, and, group, level, shame, can, also, be, described, as, an, unpleasant, self, conscious, emotion, that, involves, negative, evaluation, of, the, self, shame, can, be, a, painful, emotion, that, is, seen, as, a, comparison, of, the, self, s, action, with, the, self, s, standards, but, may, equally, stem, from, comparison, of, the, self, s, state, of, being, with, the, ideal, social, context, s, standard, according, to, neda, sedighimornani, shame, is, relevant, in, several, psychological, disorders, such, as, depression, phobia, of, social, interactions, and, even, some, eating, disorders, some, scales, of, shame, measure, it, to, assess, emotional, states, whereas, other, shame, scales, are, used, to, assess, emotional, traits, or, dispositions, shame, proneness, to, shame, generally, means, to, actively, assign, or, communicate, a, state, of, shame, to, another, person, behaviors, designed, to, uncover, or, expose, others, are, sometimes, used, to, place, shame, on, the, other, person, whereas, having, shame, means, to, maintain, a, sense, of, restraint, against, offending, others, as, with, modesty, humility, and, deference, in, contrast, to, having, shame, is, to, have, no, shame, behaving, without, restraint, offending, others, similar, to, other, emotions, like, pride, or, hubris, nineteenth, century, scientist, charles, darwin, described, shame, affect, in, the, physical, form, of, blushing, confusion, of, mind, downward, cast, eyes, slack, posture, and, lowered, head, darwin, noted, these, observations, of, shame, affect, in, human, populations, worldwide, as, mentioned, in, his, book, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, darwin, also, mentions, how, the, sense, of, warmth, or, heat, associated, with, the, vasodilation, of, the, face, and, skin, can, result, in, an, even, greater, sense, of, shame, more, commonly, the, act, of, crying, can, be, associated, with, shame, when, people, feel, shame, the, focus, of, their, evaluation, is, on, the, self, or, identity, shame, is, a, self, punishing, acknowledgment, of, something, gone, wrong, it, is, associated, with, mental, undoing, studies, of, shame, showed, that, when, ashamed, people, feel, that, their, entire, self, is, worthless, powerless, and, small, they, also, feel, exposed, to, an, audience, real, or, imagined, that, exists, purely, for, the, purpose, of, confirming, that, the, self, is, worthless, shame, and, the, sense, of, self, is, stigmatized, or, treated, unfairly, like, being, overtly, rejected, by, parents, in, favor, of, siblings, needs, and, is, assigned, externally, by, others, regardless, of, one, s, own, experience, or, awareness, an, individual, who, is, in, a, state, of, shame, will, assign, the, shame, internally, from, being, a, victim, of, the, environment, and, the, same, is, assigned, externally, or, assigned, by, others, regardless, of, one, s, own, experience, or, awareness, a, sense, of, shame, is, the, feeling, known, as, guilt, but, consciousness, or, awareness, of, shame, as, a, state, or, condition, defines, core, toxic, shame, lewis, 1971, tangney, 1998, the, person, experiencing, shame, might, not, be, able, to, or, perhaps, simply, will, not, identify, their, emotional, state, as, shame, and, there, is, an, intrinsic, connection, between, shame, and, the, mechanism, of, denial, the, key, emotion, in, all, forms, of, shame, is, contempt, miller, 1984, tomkins, 1967, two, realms, in, which, shame, is, expressed, are, the, consciousness, of, self, as, bad, and, self, as, inadequate, people, employ, negative, coping, responses, to, counter, deep, rooted, associated, sense, of, shameworthiness, the, shame, cognition, may, occur, as, a, result, of, the, experience, of, shame, affect, or, more, generally, in, any, situation, of, embarrassment, dishonor, disgrace, inadequacy, humiliation, or, chagrin, shame, devaluation, and, their, interrelationship, are, similar, across, cultures, prompting, some, researchers, to, suggest, that, there, is, a, universal, human, psychology, of, cultural, valuation, and, devaluation, physiological, symptoms, caused, by, the, autonomic, nervous, system, include, blushing, perspiration, dizziness, or, nausea, a, feeling, of, paralysis, numbness, or, loss, of, muscle, tone, might, set, in, making, it, difficult, to, think, act, or, talk, children, often, visibly, slump, and, hang, their, head, in, an, effort, to, hide, this, reaction, adults, are, more, likely, to, laugh, stare, avoid, eye, contact, freeze, their, face, tighten, their, jaw, or, show, a, look, of, contempt, in, another, s, presence, there, s, a, feeling, of, being, strange, naked, transparent, or, exposed, as, if, wanting, to, disappear, or, hide, the, shame, code, was, developed, to, capture, behavior, as, it, unfolds, in, real, time, during, the, socially, stressful, and, potentially, shaming, spontaneous, speech, task, and, was, coded, into, the, following, categories, 1, body, tension, 2, facial, tension, 3, stillness, 4, fidgeting, 5, nervous, positive, affect, 6, hiding, and, avoiding, 7, verbal, flow, and, uncertainty, and, 8, silence, shame, tendencies, were, associated, with, more, fidgeting, and, less, freezing, but, both, stillness, and, fidgeting, were, social, cues, that, convey, distress, to, the, observer, and, may, elicit, less, harsh, responses, thus, both, may, be, an, attempt, to, diminish, further, shaming, experiences, shame, involves, global, self, focused, negative, attributions, based, on, the, anticipated, imagined, or, real, negative, evaluations, of, others, and, is, accompanied, by, a, powerful, urge, to, hide, withdraw, or, escape, from, the, source, of, these, evaluations, these, negative, evaluations, arise, from, transgressions, of, standards, rules, or, goals, and, cause, the, individual, to, feel, separate, from, the, group, for, which, these, standards, rules, or, goals, exist, resulting, in, one, of, the, most, powerful, painful, and, potentially, destructive, experiences, known, to, humans, the, boundaries, between, concepts, of, shame, guilt, and, embarrassment, are, not, easily, delineated, they, are, all, similar, reactions, or, emotions, in, the, fact, that, they, are, self, conscious, implying, self, reflection, and, self, evaluation, according, to, cultural, anthropologist, ruth, benedict, shame, arises, from, a, violation, of, cultural, or, social, values, while, guilt, feelings, arise, from, violations, of, one, s, internal, values, thus, shame, arises, when, one, s, defects, are, exposed, to, others, and, results, from, the, negative, evaluation, whether, real, or, imagined, of, others, guilt, on, the, other, hand, comes, from, one, s, own, negative, evaluation, of, oneself, for, instance, when, one, acts, contrary, to, one, s, values, or, idea, of, one, s, self, shame, is, more, attributed, to, internal, characteristics, and, guilt, is, more, attributed, to, behavioral, characteristics, thus, it, might, be, possible, to, feel, ashamed, of, thought, or, behavior, that, no, one, actually, knows, about, because, one, is, afraid, of, what, they, find, and, conversely, feeling, guilty, about, the, act, of, gaining, approval, from, others, psychoanalyst, helen, b, lewis, argued, that, the, experience, of, shame, is, directly, about, the, self, which, is, the, focus, of, evaluation, in, guilt, the, self, is, not, the, central, object, of, negative, evaluation, but, rather, the, thing, done, is, the, focus, similarly, fossum, and, mason, say, in, their, book, facing, shame, that, while, guilt, is, a, painful, feeling, of, regret, and, responsibility, for, one, s, actions, shame, is, a, painful, feeling, about, oneself, as, a, person, following, this, line, of, reasoning, psychiatrist, judith, lewis, herman, concludes, that, shame, is, an, acutely, self, conscious, state, in, which, the, self, is, split, imagining, the, self, in, the, eyes, of, the, other, by, contrast, in, guilt, the, self, is, unified, clinical, psychologist, gershen, kaufman, s, view, of, shame, is, derived, from, that, of, affect, theory, namely, that, shame, is, one, of, a, set, of, instinctual, short, duration, physiological, reactions, to, stimulation, in, this, view, guilt, is, seen, as, a, learned, behavior, consisting, primarily, of, self, directed, blame, or, contempt, and, the, shame, that, results, from, this, behavior, making, up, a, part, of, the, overall, experience, of, guilt, here, self, blame, and, self, contempt, mean, the, application, towards, a, part, of, one, s, self, of, exactly, the, same, dynamic, that, blaming, of, and, contempt, for, others, represents, when, it, is, applied, interpersonally, kaufman, saw, that, mechanisms, such, as, blame, or, contempt, may, be, used, as, a, defending, strategy, against, the, experience, of, shame, and, that, someone, who, has, a, pattern, of, applying, them, to, himself, may, well, attempt, to, defend, against, a, shame, experience, by, applying, self, blame, or, self, contempt, this, however, can, lead, to, an, internalized, self, reinforcing, sequence, of, shame, events, for, which, kaufman, coined, the, term, shame, spiral, shame, can, also, be, used, as, a, strategy, when, feeling, guilty, especially, when, the, hope, is, to, avoid, punishment, by, inspiring, compassion, one, view, of, difference, between, shame, and, embarrassment, says, that, shame, does, not, necessarily, involve, public, humiliation, while, embarrassment, does, that, is, one, can, feel, shame, for, an, act, known, only, to, oneself, but, to, be, embarrassed, one, s, actions, must, be, revealed, to, others, in, the, field, of, ethics, moral, psychology, in, particular, however, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, or, not, shame, is, a, heteronomous, emotion, i, e, whether, or, not, shame, does, involve, recognition, on, the, part, of, the, ashamed, that, they, have, been, judged, negatively, by, others, another, view, of, the, dividing, line, between, shame, and, embarrassment, holds, that, the, difference, is, one, of, intensity, in, this, view, embarrassment, is, simply, a, less, intense, experience, of, shame, it, is, adaptive, and, functional, extreme, or, toxic, shame, is, a, much, more, intense, experience, and, one, that, is, not, functional, in, fact, according, to, this, view, toxic, shame, can, be, debilitating, the, dividing, line, then, is, between, functional, and, dysfunctional, shame, this, includes, the, idea, that, shame, has, a, function, or, benefit, for, the, organism, immanuel, kant, and, his, followers, held, that, shame, is, heteronomous, comes, from, others, bernard, williams, and, others, have, argued, that, shame, can, be, autonomous, comes, from, oneself, shame, may, carry, the, connotation, of, a, response, to, something, that, is, morally, wrong, whereas, embarrassment, is, the, response, to, something, that, is, morally, neutral, but, socially, unacceptable, another, view, of, shame, and, guilt, is, that, shame, is, a, focus, on, self, while, guilt, is, a, focus, on, behavior, simply, put, a, person, who, feels, guilt, is, saying, i, did, something, bad, while, someone, who, feels, shame, is, saying, i, am, bad, embarrassment, has, occasionally, been, viewed, as, a, less, severe, or, intense, form, of, shame, which, usually, varies, on, different, aspects, such, as, intensity, the, physical, reaction, of, the, person, or, the, size, of, the, present, social, audience, but, it, is, distinct, from, shame, in, that, it, involves, a, focus, on, the, self, presented, to, an, audience, rather, than, the, entire, self, it, is, experienced, as, a, sense, of, fluster, and, slight, mortification, resulting, from, a, social, awkwardness, that, leads, to, a, loss, of, esteem, in, the, eyes, of, others, embarrassment, has, been, characterized, as, a, sudden, onset, sense, of, fluster, and, mortification, that, results, when, the, self, is, evaluated, negatively, because, one, has, committed, or, anticipates, committing, a, gaffe, or, awkward, performance, before, an, audience, so, because, shame, is, focused, on, the, entire, self, those, who, become, embarrassed, apologize, for, their, mistake, and, then, begin, to, repair, things, and, this, repair, involves, redressing, harm, done, to, the, presented, self, one, view, of, difference, between, shame, and, embarrassment, says, that, shame, does, not, necessarily, involve, public, humiliation, while, embarrassment, does, that, is, one, can, feel, shame, for, an, act, known, only, to, oneself, but, to, be, embarrassed, one, s, actions, must, be, revealed, to, others, therefore, shame, can, only, be, experienced, in, private, and, embarrassment, can, never, be, experienced, in, private, in, the, field, of, ethics, moral, psychology, in, particular, however, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, or, not, shame, is, a, heteronomous, emotion, i, e, whether, or, not, shame, does, involve, recognition, on, the, part, of, the, ashamed, that, they, have, been, judged, negatively, by, others, this, is, a, mature, heteronomous, type, of, shame, where, the, agent, does, not, judge, herself, negatively, but, due, to, the, negative, judgments, of, others, suspects, that, she, may, deserve, negative, judgment, and, feel, shame, on, this, basis, therefore, shame, may, carry, the, connotation, of, a, response, to, something, that, is, morally, wrong, whereas, embarrassment, is, the, response, to, something, that, is, morally, neutral, but, socially, unacceptable, psychologist, robert, karen, identified, four, categories, of, shame, existential, situational, class, and, narcissistic, existential, shame, occurs, when, we, become, self, aware, of, an, objective, unpleasant, truth, about, ourselves, or, our, situation, situational, shame, is, the, feeling, we, have, when, violating, an, ethical, principle, interpersonal, boundary, or, cultural, norm, class, shame, relates, to, social, power, and, pertains, to, skin, color, social, class, ethnic, background, and, gender, and, occurs, in, societies, that, have, rigid, caste, stratifications, or, disparate, classes, narcissistic, shame, occurs, when, our, self, image, and, pride, are, wounded, affecting, how, we, feel, and, think, about, ourselves, as, an, individual, in, contrast, as, a, member, of, a, group, there, are, many, different, reasons, that, people, might, feel, shame, according, to, joseph, burgo, there, are, four, different, aspects, of, shame, he, calls, these, aspects, of, shame, paradigms, in, his, first, subdivision, of, shame, he, looks, into, is, unrequited, love, which, is, when, you, love, someone, but, your, partner, does, not, reciprocate, or, one, is, rejected, by, somebody, that, they, like, this, can, be, mortifying, and, shaming, unrequited, love, can, be, shown, in, other, ways, as, well, for, example, the, way, a, mother, treats, her, new, born, baby, an, experiment, called, the, still, face, experiment, was, done, where, a, mother, showed, her, baby, love, and, talked, to, the, baby, for, a, set, period, of, time, she, then, went, a, few, minutes, without, talking, to, the, baby, this, resulted, with, the, baby, making, different, expressions, to, get, the, mother, s, attention, when, the, mother, stopped, giving, the, baby, attention, the, baby, felt, shame, according, to, research, on, unrequited, love, people, tend, to, date, others, who, are, similar, in, attractiveness, leaving, those, less, attractive, to, feel, an, initial, disappointment, that, creates, a, type, of, unrequited, love, in, the, person, the, second, type, of, shame, is, unwanted, exposure, this, would, take, place, if, you, were, called, out, in, front, of, a, whole, class, for, doing, something, wrong, or, if, someone, saw, you, doing, something, you, did, not, want, them, to, see, this, is, what, you, would, normally, think, of, when, you, hear, the, word, shame, disappointed, expectation, would, be, your, third, type, of, shame, according, to, burgo, this, could, be, not, passing, a, class, having, a, friendship, go, wrong, or, not, getting, a, big, promotion, in, a, job, that, you, thought, you, would, get, the, fourth, and, final, type, of, shame, according, to, burgo, is, exclusion, which, also, means, being, left, out, many, people, will, do, anything, to, just, fit, in, or, want, to, belong, in, society, e, g, at, school, work, friendships, relationships, everywhere, it, has, been, suggested, that, narcissism, in, adults, is, related, to, defenses, against, shame, and, that, narcissistic, personality, disorder, is, connected, to, shame, as, well, according, to, psychiatrist, glen, gabbard, npd, can, be, broken, down, into, two, subtypes, a, grandiose, arrogant, thick, skinned, oblivious, subtype, and, an, easily, hurt, oversensitive, ashamed, hypervigilant, subtype, the, oblivious, subtype, presents, for, admiration, envy, and, appreciation, a, grandiose, self, that, is, the, antithesis, of, a, weak, internalized, self, which, hides, in, shame, while, the, hypervigilant, subtype, neutralizes, devaluation, by, seeing, others, as, unjust, abusers, another, form, of, mental, illness, where, shame, is, one, of, the, most, notable, symptoms, is, depression, in, a, meta, analytic, review, performed, in, 2011, it, was, found, that, there, were, stronger, associations, with, shame, and, depression, than, with, guilt, and, depression, external, shame, or, a, negative, view, of, the, self, seen, through, other, people, had, larger, effect, sizes, correlated, with, depression, than, did, internal, shame, there, are, different, degrees, or, levels, of, symptoms, of, shame, in, depression, depending, on, different, cultures, those, who, show, greater, symptoms, of, shame, in, depression, usually, live, in, more, socio, economic, cultures, according, to, the, anthropologist, ruth, benedict, cultures, may, be, classified, by, their, emphasis, on, the, use, of, either, shame, a, shame, society, or, guilt, to, regulate, the, social, activities, of, individuals, shame, may, be, used, by, those, people, who, commit, relational, aggression, and, may, occur, in, the, workplace, as, a, form, of, overt, social, control, or, aggression, shaming, is, used, in, some, societies, as, a, type, of, punishment, shunning, or, ostracism, in, this, sense, the, real, purpose, of, shaming, is, not, to, punish, crimes, but, to, create, the, kind, of, people, who, don, t, commit, them, in, 1963, erving, goffman, published, stigma, notes, on, the, management, of, spoiled, identity, for, goffman, the, condition, when, a, particular, person, is, excluded, from, full, societal, reception, is, greatly, discrediting, this, negative, evaluation, may, be, felt, or, enacted, thus, stigma, can, occur, when, society, labels, someone, as, tainted, less, desirable, or, handicapped, when, felt, it, refers, to, the, shame, associated, with, having, a, condition, and, the, fear, of, being, discriminated, against, when, enacted, it, refers, to, actual, discrimination, of, this, kind, shame, in, relation, to, stigma, studies, have, most, often, come, from, the, sense, and, mental, consequences, that, young, adolescents, find, themselves, trapped, in, when, they, are, deciding, to, use, a, condom, in, std, or, hiv, protection, the, other, use, of, stigma, and, shame, is, when, someone, has, a, disease, such, as, cancer, where, people, look, to, blame, something, for, their, feelings, of, shame, and, circumstance, of, sickness, jessica, m, sales, et, al, researched, young, adolescents, ages, 15, 21, on, whether, they, had, used, protection, in, the, 14, days, prior, to, coming, in, for, the, study, the, answers, showed, implications, of, shame, and, stigma, which, received, an, accommodating, score, the, scores, prior, history, of, stds, demographics, and, psychosocial, variables, were, put, into, a, hierarchical, regression, model, to, determine, probability, of, an, adolescents, chances, of, using, protected, sex, in, the, future, the, study, found, that, the, higher, sense, of, shame, and, stigma, the, higher, chance, the, adolescent, would, use, protection, in, the, future, this, means, that, if, a, person, is, more, aware, of, consequences, is, more, in, tune, with, themselves, and, the, stigma, stereotypes, disgrace, etc, they, will, be, more, likely, to, protect, themselves, the, study, shows, that, placing, more, shame, and, stigma, in, the, mind, of, people, can, be, more, prone, to, protecting, themselves, from, the, consequences, that, follow, the, action, of, unprotected, sex, hiv, related, stigma, from, those, who, are, born, with, hiv, due, to, their, maternal, genetics, have, a, proneness, to, shame, and, avoidant, coping, david, s, bennett, et, al, studied, the, ages, 12, 24, of, self, reported, measures, of, potential, risk, factors, and, three, domains, of, internalizing, factors, depression, anxiety, and, ptsd, the, findings, suggested, that, those, who, had, more, shame, proneness, and, more, awareness, of, hiv, stigma, had, a, greater, amount, of, depressive, and, ptsd, symptoms, this, means, that, those, who, have, high, hiv, stigma, and, shame, do, not, seek, help, from, interventions, rather, they, avoid, the, situation, that, could, cause, them, to, find, themselves, in, a, predicament, of, other, mental, health, issues, older, age, was, related, to, greater, hiv, related, stigma, and, the, female, gender, was, more, related, to, stigma, and, internalizing, symptoms, depression, anxiety, ptsd, stigma, was, also, associated, with, greater, shame, proneness, chapple, et, al, researched, people, with, lung, cancer, in, regards, to, the, shame, and, stigma, that, comes, from, the, disease, the, stigma, that, accompanies, lung, cancer, is, most, commonly, caused, by, smoking, however, there, are, many, ways, to, contract, lung, cancer, therefore, those, who, did, not, receive, lung, cancer, from, smoking, often, feel, shame, blaming, themselves, for, something, they, did, not, do, the, stigma, effects, their, opinions, of, themselves, while, shame, is, found, to, blame, other, cancer, causing, factors, tobacco, products, anti, tobacco, products, or, ignoring, the, disease, in, avoidant, coping, altogether, the, stigma, associated, with, lung, cancer, effected, relationships, of, patients, with, their,

particular, individuals, are, singled, out, because, of, their, behavior, or, suspected, crimes, often, by, marking, them, publicly, such, as, hester, prynne, in, nathaniel, hawthorne, s, the,
