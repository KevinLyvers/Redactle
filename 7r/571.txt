pennsylvania, philadelphia, and, trenton, new, jersey, what, jefferson, called, his, original, rough, draft, one, of, several, revisions, is, preserved, at, the, library, of, congress, in, washington,

gettysburg, national, cemetery, the, declaration, of, independence, has, proven, an, influential, and, globally, impactful, statement, on, human, rights, particularly, its, second, sentence, we, hold, these, truths, to, be, self, evident, that, all, men, are, created, equal, that, they, are, endowed, by, their, creator, with, certain, unalienable, rights, that, among, these, are, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, stephen, lucas, called, the, declaration, of, independence, one, of, the, best, known, sentences, in, the, english, language, historian, joseph, ellis, has, written, that, the, document, contains, the, most, potent, and, consequential, words, in, american, history, the, passage, came, to, represent, a, moral, standard, to, which, the, united, states, should, strive, this, view, was, notably, promoted, by, lincoln, who, considered, the, declaration, to, be, the, foundation, of, his, political, philosophy, and, argued, that, it, is, a, statement, of, principles, through, which, the, united, states, constitution, should, be, interpreted, 126, the, 56, delegates, who, signed, the, declaration, represented, each, of, the, thirteen, colonies, new, hampshire, massachusetts, bay, rhode, island, and, providence, plantations, connecticut, new, york, new, jersey, pennsylvania, maryland, delaware, virginia, north, carolina, south, carolina, and, georgia, the, declaration, of, independence, inspired, many, similar, documents, in, other, countries, the, first, being, the, 1789, declaration, of, united, belgian, states, issued, during, the, brabant, revolution, in, the, austrian, netherlands, it, also, served, as, the, primary, model, for, numerous, declarations, of, independence, in, europe, latin, america, africa, and, oceania, following, its, adoption, 113, believe, me, dear, sir, there, is, not, in, the, british, empire, a, man, who, more, cordially, loves, a, union, with, great, britain, than, i, do, but, by, the, god, that, made, me, i, will, cease, to, exist, before, i, yield, to, a, connection, on, such, terms, as, the, british, parliament, propose, and, in, this, i, think, i, speak, the, sentiments, of, america, by, the, time, the, declaration, of, independence, was, adopted, in, july, 1776, the, thirteen, colonies, and, great, britain, had, been, at, war, for, more, than, a, year, relations, had, been, deteriorating, between, the, colonies, and, the, mother, country, since, 1763, parliament, enacted, a, series, of, measures, to, increase, revenue, from, the, colonies, such, as, the, stamp, act, of, 1765, and, the, townshend, acts, of, 1767, parliament, believed, that, these, acts, were, a, legitimate, means, of, having, the, colonies, pay, their, fair, share, of, the, costs, to, keep, them, in, the, british, empire, many, colonists, however, had, developed, a, different, perspective, of, the, empire, the, colonies, were, not, directly, represented, in, parliament, and, colonists, argued, that, parliament, had, no, right, to, levy, taxes, upon, them, this, tax, dispute, was, part, of, a, larger, divergence, between, british, and, american, interpretations, of, the, british, constitution, and, the, extent, of, parliament, s, authority, in, the, colonies, 162, the, orthodox, british, view, dating, from, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, was, that, parliament, was, the, supreme, authority, throughout, the, empire, and, anything, that, parliament, did, was, constitutional, 200, 202, in, the, colonies, however, the, idea, had, developed, that, the, british, constitution, recognized, certain, fundamental, rights, that, no, government, could, violate, including, parliament, 180, 182, after, the, townshend, acts, some, essayists, questioned, whether, parliament, had, any, legitimate, jurisdiction, in, the, colonies, as, a, result, of, this, ideological, shift, in, the, colonies, many, colonialists, participated, in, tax, protests, against, the, royal, authority, such, as, the, pine, tree, riot, in, 1772, and, the, boston, tea, party, in, 1773, anticipating, the, arrangement, of, the, british, commonwealth, by, 1774, american, writers, such, as, samuel, adams, james, wilson, and, thomas, jefferson, argued, that, parliament, was, the, legislature, of, great, britain, only, and, that, the, colonies, which, had, their, own, legislatures, were, connected, to, the, rest, of, the, empire, only, through, their, allegiance, to, the, crown, 224, 225, in, 1774, parliament, passed, the, coercive, acts, known, as, the, intolerable, acts, in, the, colonies, this, was, intended, to, punish, the, colonists, for, the, gaspee, affair, of, 1772, and, the, boston, tea, party, of, 1773, many, colonists, considered, the, coercive, acts, to, be, in, violation, of, the, british, constitution, and, a, threat, to, the, liberties, of, all, of, british, america, in, september, 1774, the, first, continental, congress, convened, in, philadelphia, to, coordinate, a, formal, response, congress, organized, a, boycott, of, british, goods, and, petitioned, the, king, for, repeal, of, the, acts, these, measures, were, unsuccessful, however, since, king, george, and, the, prime, minister, lord, north, were, determined, to, enforce, parliamentary, supremacy, over, the, thirteen, colonies, in, november, 1774, king, george, in, a, letter, to, north, wrote, blows, must, decide, whether, they, are, to, be, subject, to, this, country, or, independent, most, colonists, still, hoped, for, reconciliation, with, great, britain, even, after, fighting, began, in, the, american, revolutionary, war, at, lexington, and, concord, in, april, 1775, the, second, continental, congress, convened, at, pennsylvania, state, house, later, renamed, independence, hall, in, philadelphia, in, may, 1775, some, delegates, supported, eventual, independence, for, the, colonies, but, none, had, yet, declared, it, publicly, which, was, an, act, of, treason, punishable, by, death, under, the, laws, of, the, british, monarchy, at, the, time, many, colonists, believed, that, parliament, no, longer, had, sovereignty, over, them, but, they, were, still, loyal, to, king, george, thinking, he, would, intercede, on, their, behalf, they, were, disabused, of, that, notion, in, late, 1775, when, the, king, rejected, congress, s, second, petition, issued, a, proclamation, of, rebellion, and, announced, before, parliament, on, october, 26, that, he, was, considering, friendly, offers, of, foreign, assistance, to, suppress, the, rebellion, 25, a, pro, american, minority, in, parliament, warned, that, the, government, was, driving, the, colonists, toward, independence, 25, despite, this, growing, popular, support, for, independence, the, second, continental, congress, initially, lacked, the, clear, authority, to, declare, it, delegates, had, been, elected, to, congress, by, 13, different, governments, which, included, extralegal, conventions, ad, hoc, committees, and, elected, assemblies, and, they, were, bound, by, the, instructions, given, to, them, regardless, of, their, personal, opinions, delegates, could, not, vote, to, declare, independence, unless, their, instructions, permitted, such, an, action, several, colonies, in, fact, expressly, prohibited, their, delegates, from, taking, any, steps, toward, separation, from, great, britain, while, other, delegations, had, instructions, that, were, ambiguous, on, the, issue, 30, consequently, advocates, of, independence, sought, to, have, the, congressional, instructions, revised, for, congress, to, declare, independence, a, majority, of, delegations, would, need, authorization, to, vote, for, it, and, at, least, one, colonial, government, would, need, to, specifically, instruct, its, delegation, to, propose, a, declaration, of, independence, in, congress, between, april, and, july, 1776, a, complex, political, war, 59, was, waged, to, bring, this, about, 671, in, january, 1776, thomas, paine, s, pamphlet, common, sense, which, described, the, uphill, battle, against, the, british, for, independence, as, a, challenging, but, achievable, and, necessary, objective, was, published, in, philadelphia, in, common, sense, paine, wrote, the, famed, phrase, these, are, the, times, that, try, men, s, souls, the, summer, soldier, and, the, sunshine, patriot, will, in, this, crisis, shrink, from, the, service, of, his, country, but, he, that, stands, it, now, deserves, the, love, and, thanks, of, man, and, woman, tyranny, like, hell, is, not, easily, conquered, yet, we, have, this, consolation, with, us, that, the, harder, the, conflict, the, more, glorious, the, triumph, 31, 32, common, sense, made, a, persuasive, impassioned, case, for, independence, which, had, not, been, given, serious, consideration, in, the, colonies, paine, linked, independence, with, protestant, beliefs, as, a, means, to, present, a, distinctly, american, political, identity, and, he, initiated, open, debate, on, a, topic, few, had, dared, to, discuss, 33, as, common, sense, was, circulated, throughout, the, thirteen, colonies, public, support, for, independence, from, great, britain, steadily, increased, after, reading, it, washington, ordered, that, it, be, read, by, his, continental, army, troops, who, were, demoralized, following, recent, military, defeats, a, week, later, washington, led, the, crossing, of, the, delaware, in, one, of, the, revolutionary, war, s, most, complex, and, daring, military, campaigns, resulting, in, a, much, needed, military, victory, in, the, battle, of, trenton, against, a, hessian, military, garrison, at, trenton, 33, 34, common, sense, was, sold, and, distributed, widely, and, read, aloud, at, taverns, and, meeting, places, in, proportion, to, the, population, of, the, colonies, at, that, time, 2, 5, million, it, had, the, largest, sale, and, circulation, of, any, book, published, in, american, history, as, of, 2006, it, remains, the, all, time, best, selling, american, title, and, is, still, in, print, today, while, some, colonists, still, hoped, for, reconciliation, public, support, for, independence, strengthened, considerably, in, early, 1776, in, february, 1776, colonists, learned, of, parliament, s, passage, of, the, prohibitory, act, which, established, a, blockade, of, american, ports, and, declared, american, ships, to, be, enemy, vessels, john, adams, a, strong, supporter, of, independence, believed, that, parliament, had, effectively, declared, american, independence, before, congress, had, been, able, to, adams, labeled, the, prohibitory, act, the, act, of, independency, calling, it, a, compleat, dismemberment, of, the, british, empire, 25, 27, support, for, declaring, independence, grew, even, more, when, it, was, confirmed, that, king, george, had, hired, german, mercenaries, to, use, against, his, american, subjects, in, the, campaign, to, revise, congressional, instructions, many, americans, formally, expressed, their, support, for, separation, from, great, britain, in, what, were, effectively, state, and, local, declarations, of, independence, historian, pauline, maier, identifies, more, than, ninety, such, declarations, that, were, issued, throughout, the, thirteen, colonies, from, april, to, july, 1776, 48, appendix, a, these, declarations, took, a, variety, of, forms, some, were, formal, written, instructions, for, congressional, delegations, such, as, the, halifax, resolves, of, april, 12, with, which, north, carolina, became, the, first, colony, to, explicitly, authorize, its, delegates, to, vote, for, independence, 678, 679, others, were, legislative, acts, that, officially, ended, british, rule, in, individual, colonies, such, as, the, rhode, island, legislature, renouncing, its, allegiance, to, great, britain, on, may, 4, the, first, colony, to, do, so, 679, many, declarations, were, resolutions, adopted, at, town, or, county, meetings, that, offered, support, for, independence, a, few, came, in, the, form, of, jury, instructions, such, as, the, statement, issued, on, april, 23, 1776, by, chief, justice, william, henry, drayton, of, south, carolina, the, law, of, the, land, authorizes, me, to, declare, that, george, the, third, king, of, great, britain, has, no, authority, over, us, and, we, owe, no, obedience, to, him, 69, 72, most, of, these, declarations, are, now, obscure, having, been, overshadowed, by, the, resolution, for, independence, approved, by, congress, on, july, 2, and, the, declaration, of, independence, approved, and, printed, on, july, 4, and, signed, in, august, 48, the, modern, scholarly, consensus, is, that, the, best, known, and, earliest, of, the, local, declarations, is, most, likely, inauthentic, the, mecklenburg, declaration, of, independence, allegedly, adopted, in, may, 1775, a, full, year, before, other, local, declarations, 174, some, colonies, held, back, from, endorsing, independence, resistance, was, centered, in, the, middle, colonies, of, new, york, new, jersey, maryland, pennsylvania, and, delaware, advocates, of, independence, saw, pennsylvania, as, the, key, if, that, colony, could, be, converted, to, the, pro, independence, cause, it, was, believed, that, the, others, would, follow, 682, on, may, 1, however, opponents, of, independence, retained, control, of, the, pennsylvania, assembly, in, a, special, election, that, had, focused, on, the, question, of, independence, 683, in, response, congress, passed, a, resolution, on, may, 10, which, had, been, promoted, by, john, adams, and, richard, henry, lee, calling, on, colonies, without, a, government, sufficient, to, the, exigencies, of, their, affairs, to, adopt, new, governments, 684, 37, the, resolution, passed, unanimously, and, was, even, supported, by, pennsylvania, s, john, dickinson, the, leader, of, the, anti, independence, faction, in, congress, who, believed, that, it, did, not, apply, to, his, colony, 684, this, day, the, congress, has, passed, the, most, important, resolution, that, ever, was, taken, in, america, john, adams, may, 15, 1776, as, was, the, custom, congress, appointed, a, committee, to, draft, a, preamble, to, explain, the, purpose, of, the, resolution, john, adams, wrote, the, preamble, which, stated, that, because, king, george, had, rejected, reconciliation, and, was, hiring, foreign, mercenaries, to, use, against, the, colonies, it, is, necessary, that, the, exercise, of, every, kind, of, authority, under, the, said, crown, should, be, totally, suppressed, 37, 684, adams, preamble, was, meant, to, encourage, the, overthrow, of, the, governments, of, pennsylvania, and, maryland, which, were, still, under, proprietary, governance, 684, congress, passed, the, preamble, on, may, 15, after, several, days, of, debate, but, four, of, the, middle, colonies, voted, against, it, and, the, maryland, delegation, walked, out, in, protest, 685, adams, regarded, his, may, 15, preamble, effectively, as, an, american, declaration, of, independence, although, a, formal, declaration, would, still, have, to, be, made, 38, on, the, same, day, that, congress, passed, adams, preamble, the, virginia, convention, set, the, stage, for, a, formal, congressional, declaration, of, independence, on, may, 15, the, convention, instructed, virginia, s, congressional, delegation, to, propose, to, that, respectable, body, to, declare, the, united, colonies, free, and, independent, states, absolved, from, all, allegiance, to, or, dependence, upon, the, crown, or, parliament, of, great, britain, 63, in, accordance, with, those, instructions, richard, henry, lee, of, virginia, presented, a, three, part, resolution, to, congress, on, june, 7, the, motion, was, seconded, by, john, adams, calling, on, congress, to, declare, independence, form, foreign, alliances, and, prepare, a, plan, of, colonial, confederation, the, part, of, the, resolution, relating, to, declaring, independence, read, resolved, that, these, united, colonies, are, and, of, right, ought, to, be, free, and, independent, states, that, they, are, absolved, from, all, allegiance, to, the, british, crown, and, that, all, political, connection, between, them, and, the, state, of, great, britain, is, and, ought, to, be, totally, dissolved, 41, lee, s, resolution, met, with, resistance, in, the, ensuing, debate, opponents, of, the, resolution, conceded, that, reconciliation, was, unlikely, with, great, britain, while, arguing, that, declaring, independence, was, premature, and, that, securing, foreign, aid, should, take, priority, 689, 690, 42, advocates, of, the, resolution, countered, that, foreign, governments, would, not, intervene, in, an, internal, british, struggle, and, so, a, formal, declaration, of, independence, was, needed, before, foreign, aid, was, possible, all, congress, needed, to, do, they, insisted, was, to, declare, a, fact, which, already, exists, 689, 33, 34, delegates, from, pennsylvania, delaware, new, jersey, maryland, and, new, york, were, still, not, yet, authorized, to, vote, for, independence, however, and, some, of, them, threatened, to, leave, congress, if, the, resolution, were, adopted, congress, therefore, voted, on, june, 10, to, postpone, further, discussion, of, lee, s, resolution, for, three, weeks, 42, 43, until, then, congress, decided, that, a, committee, should, prepare, a, document, announcing, and, explaining, independence, in, case, lee, s, resolution, was, approved, when, it, was, brought, up, again, in, july, support, for, a, congressional, declaration, of, independence, was, consolidated, in, the, final, weeks, of, june, 1776, on, june, 14, the, connecticut, assembly, instructed, its, delegates, to, propose, independence, and, the, following, day, the, legislatures, of, new, hampshire, and, delaware, authorized, their, delegates, to, declare, independence, 691, 692, in, pennsylvania, political, struggles, ended, with, the, dissolution, of, the, colonial, assembly, and, a, new, conference, of, committees, under, thomas, mckean, authorized, pennsylvania, s, delegates, to, declare, independence, on, june, 18, 691, the, provincial, congress, of, new, jersey, had, been, governing, the, province, since, january, 1776, they, resolved, on, june, 15, that, royal, governor, william, franklin, was, an, enemy, to, the, liberties, of, this, country, and, had, him, arrested, 692, on, june, 21, they, chose, new, delegates, to, congress, and, empowered, them, to, join, in, a, declaration, of, independence, 693, as, of, the, end, of, june, only, two, of, the, thirteen, colonies, had, yet, to, authorize, independence, maryland, and, new, york, maryland, s, delegates, previously, walked, out, when, the, continental, congress, adopted, adams, may, 15, preamble, and, had, sent, to, the, annapolis, convention, for, instructions, 694, on, may, 20, the, annapolis, convention, rejected, adams, preamble, instructing, its, delegates, to, remain, against, independence, but, samuel, chase, went, to, maryland, and, thanks, to, local, resolutions, in, favor, of, independence, was, able, to, get, the, annapolis, convention, to, change, its, mind, on, june, 28, 694, 696, 68, only, the, new, york, delegates, were, unable, to, get, revised, instructions, when, congress, had, been, considering, the, resolution, of, independence, on, june, 8, the, new, york, provincial, congress, told, the, delegates, to, wait, 698, but, on, june, 30, the, provincial, congress, evacuated, new, york, as, british, forces, approached, and, would, not, convene, again, until, july, 10, this, meant, that, new, york, s, delegates, would, not, be, authorized, to, declare, independence, until, after, congress, had, made, its, decision, political, maneuvering, was, setting, the, stage, for, an, official, declaration, of, independence, even, while, a, document, was, being, written, to, explain, the, decision, on, june, 11, 1776, congress, appointed, the, committee, of, five, to, draft, a, declaration, including, john, adams, of, massachusetts, benjamin, franklin, of, pennsylvania, thomas, jefferson, of, virginia, robert, r, livingston, of, new, york, and, roger, sherman, of, connecticut, the, committee, took, no, minutes, so, there, is, some, uncertainty, about, how, the, drafting, process, proceeded, contradictory, accounts, were, written, many, years, later, by, jefferson, and, adams, too, many, years, to, be, regarded, as, entirely, reliable, although, their, accounts, are, frequently, cited, 97, 105, what, is, certain, is, that, the, committee, discussed, the, general, outline, which, the, document, should, follow, and, decided, that, jefferson, would, write, the, first, draft, the, committee, in, general, and, jefferson, in, particular, thought, that, adams, should, write, the, document, but, adams, persuaded, them, to, choose, jefferson, and, promised, to, consult, with, him, personally, jefferson, largely, wrote, the, declaration, of, independence, in, isolation, between, june, 11, 1776, and, june, 28, 1776, from, the, second, floor, of, a, three, story, home, he, was, renting, at, 700, market, street, in, philadelphia, now, called, the, declaration, house, and, within, walking, distance, of, independence, hall, considering, congress, s, busy, schedule, jefferson, probably, had, limited, time, for, writing, over, these, 17, days, and, he, likely, wrote, his, first, draft, quickly, 104, examination, of, the, text, of, the, early, declaration, drafts, reflects, the, influence, that, john, locke, and, thomas, paine, author, of, common, sense, had, on, jefferson, he, then, consulted, the, other, members, of, the, committee, of, five, who, offered, minor, changes, and, then, produced, another, copy, incorporating, these, alterations, the, committee, presented, this, copy, to, the, congress, on, june, 28, 1776, the, title, of, the, document, was, a, declaration, by, the, representatives, of, the, united, states, of, america, in, general, congress, assembled, 4, congress, ordered, that, the, draft, lie, on, the, table, 701, and, then, methodically, edited, jefferson, s, primary, document, for, the, next, two, days, shortening, it, by, a, fourth, removing, unnecessary, wording, and, improving, sentence, structure, they, removed, jefferson, s, assertion, that, king, george, iii, had, forced, slavery, onto, the, colonies, in, order, to, moderate, the, document, and, appease, those, in, south, carolina, and, georgia, both, states, which, had, significant, involvement, in, the, slave, trade, jefferson, later, wrote, in, his, autobiography, that, northern, states, were, also, supportive, towards, the, clauses, removal, for, though, their, people, had, very, few, slaves, themselves, yet, they, had, been, pretty, considerable, carriers, of, them, to, others, jefferson, wrote, that, congress, had, mangled, his, draft, version, but, the, declaration, that, was, finally, produced, was, the, majestic, document, that, inspired, both, contemporaries, and, posterity, in, the, words, of, his, biographer, john, ferling, congress, tabled, the, draft, of, the, declaration, on, monday, july, 1, and, resolved, itself, into, a, committee, of, the, whole, with, benjamin, harrison, of, virginia, presiding, and, they, resumed, debate, on, lee, s, resolution, of, independence, john, dickinson, made, one, last, effort, to, delay, the, decision, arguing, that, congress, should, not, declare, independence, without, first, securing, a, foreign, alliance, and, finalizing, the, articles, of, confederation, 699, john, adams, gave, a, speech, in, reply, to, dickinson, restating, the, case, for, an, immediate, declaration, a, vote, was, taken, after, a, long, day, of, speeches, each, colony, casting, a, single, vote, as, always, the, delegation, for, each, colony, numbered, from, two, to, seven, members, and, each, delegation, voted, among, themselves, to, determine, the, colony, s, vote, pennsylvania, and, south, carolina, voted, against, declaring, independence, the, new, york, delegation, abstained, lacking, permission, to, vote, for, independence, delaware, cast, no, vote, because, the, delegation, was, split, between, thomas, mckean, who, voted, yes, and, george, read, who, voted, no, the, remaining, nine, delegations, voted, in, favor, of, independence, which, meant, that, the, resolution, had, been, approved, by, the, committee, of, the, whole, the, next, step, was, for, the, resolution, to, be, voted, upon, by, congress, itself, edward, rutledge, of, south, carolina, was, opposed, to, lee, s, resolution, but, desirous, of, unanimity, and, he, moved, that, the, vote, be, postponed, until, the, following, day, 700, on, july, 2, south, carolina, reversed, its, position, and, voted, for, independence, in, the, pennsylvania, delegation, dickinson, and, robert, morris, abstained, allowing, the, delegation, to, vote, three, to, two, in, favor, of, independence, the, tie, in, the, delaware, delegation, was, broken, by, the, timely, arrival, of, caesar, rodney, who, voted, for, independence, the, new, york, delegation, abstained, once, again, since, they, were, still, not, authorized, to, vote, for, independence, although, they, were, allowed, to, do, so, a, week, later, by, the, new, york, provincial, congress, 45, the, resolution, of, independence, was, adopted, with, twelve, affirmative, votes, and, one, abstention, and, the, colonies, formally, severed, political, ties, with, great, britain, john, adams, wrote, to, his, wife, on, the, following, day, and, predicted, that, july, 2, would, become, a, great, american, holiday, 703, 704, he, thought, that, the, vote, for, independence, would, be, commemorated, he, did, not, foresee, that, americans, would, instead, celebrate, independence, day, on, the, date, when, the, announcement, of, that, act, was, finalized, 160, 161, i, am, apt, to, believe, that, will, be, celebrated, by, succeeding, generations, as, the, great, anniversary, festival, it, ought, to, be, commemorated, as, the, day, of, deliverance, by, solemn, acts, of, devotion, to, god, almighty, it, ought, to, be, solemnized, with, pomp, and, parade, with, shews, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and, illuminations, from, one, end, of, this, continent, to, the, other, from, this, time, forward, forever, more, congress, next, turned, its, attention, to, the, committee, s, draft, of, the, declaration, they, made, a, few, changes, in, wording, during, several, days, of, debate, and, deleted, nearly, a, fourth, of, the, text, the, wording, of, the, declaration, of, independence, was, approved, on, july, 4, 1776, and, sent, to, the, printer, for, publication, there, is, a, distinct, change, in, wording, from, this, original, broadside, printing, of, the, declaration, and, the, final, official, engrossed, copy, the, word, unanimous, was, inserted, as, a, result, of, a, congressional, resolution, passed, on, july, 19, 1776, resolved, that, the, declaration, passed, on, the, 4th, be, fairly, engrossed, on, parchment, with, the, title, and, stile, of, the, unanimous, declaration, of, the, thirteen, united, states, of, america, and, that, the, same, when, engrossed, be, signed, by, every, member, of, congress, historian, george, athan, billias, says, independence, amounted, to, a, new, status, of, interdependence, the, united, states, was, now, a, sovereign, nation, entitled, to, the, privileges, and, responsibilities, that, came, with, that, status, america, thus, became, a, member, of, the, international, community, which, meant, becoming, a, maker, of, treaties, and, alliances, a, military, ally, in, diplomacy, and, a, partner, in, foreign, trade, on, a, more, equal, basis, the, declaration, is, not, divided, into, formal, sections, but, it, is, often, discussed, as, consisting, of, five, parts, introduction, preamble, indictment, of, king, george, iii, denunciation, of, the, british, people, and, conclusion, asserts, as, a, matter, of, natural, law, the, ability, of, a, people, to, assume, political, independence, acknowledges, that, the, grounds, for, such, independence, must, be, reasonable, and, therefore, explicable, and, ought, to, be, explained, when, in, the, course, of, human, events, it, becomes, necessary, for, one, people, to, dissolve, the, political, bands, which, have, connected, them, with, another, and, to, assume, among, the, powers, of, the, earth, the, separate, and, equal, station, to, which, the, laws, of, nature, and, of, nature, s, god, entitle, them, a, decent, respect, to, the, opinions, of, mankind, requires, that, they, should, declare, the, causes, which, impel, them, to, the, separation, outlines, a, general, philosophy, of, government, that, justifies, revolution, when, government, harms, natural, rights, we, hold, these, truths, to, be, self, evident, that, all, men, are, created, equal, that, they, are, endowed, by, their, creator, with, certain, unalienable, rights, that, among, these, are, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, that, to, secure, these, rights, governments, are, instituted, among, men, deriving, their, just, powers, from, the, consent, of, the, governed, that, whenever, any, form, of, government, becomes, destructive, of, these, ends, it, is, the, right, of, the, people, to, alter, or, to, abolish, it, and, to, institute, new, government, laying, its, foundation, on, such, principles, and, organizing, its, powers, in, such, form, as, to, them, shall, seem, most, likely, to, effect, their, safety, and, happiness, prudence, indeed, will, dictate, that, governments, long, established, should, not, be, changed, for, light, and, transient, causes, and, accordingly, all, experience, hath, shewn, that, mankind, are, more, disposed, to, suffer, while, evils, are, sufferable, than, to, right, themselves, by, abolishing, the, forms, to, which, they, are, accustomed, but, when, a, long, train, of, abuses, and, usurpations, pursuing, invariably, the, same, object, evinces, a, design, to, reduce, them, under, absolute, despotism, it, is, their, right, it, is, their, duty, to, throw, off, such, government, and, to, provide, new, guards, for, their, future, security, a, bill, of, grievances, documenting, the, king, s, repeated, injuries, and, usurpations, of, the, americans, rights, and, liberties, such, has, been, the, patient, sufferance, of, these, colonies, and, such, is, now, the, necessity, which, constrains, them, to, alter, their, former, systems, of, government, the, history, of, the, present, king, of, great, britain, is, a, history, of, repeated, injuries, and, usurpations, all, having, in, direct, object, the, establishment, of, an, absolute, tyranny, over, these, states, to, prove, this, let, facts, be, submitted, to, a, candid, world, he, has, refused, his, assent, to, laws, the, most, wholesome, and, necessary, for, the, public, good, he, has, forbidden, his, governors, to, pass, laws, of, immediate, and, pressing, importance, unless, suspended, in, their, operation, till, his, assent, should, be, obtained, and, when, so, suspended, he, has, utterly, neglected, to, attend, to, them, he, has, refused, to, pass, other, laws, for, the, accommodation, of, large, districts, of, people, unless, those, people, would, relinquish, the, right, of, representation, in, the, legislature, a, right, inestimable, to, them, and, formidable, to, tyrants, only, he, has, called, together, legislative, bodies, at, places, unusual, uncomfortable, and, distant, from, the, depository, of, their, public, records, for, the, sole, purpose, of, fatiguing, them, into, compliance, with, his, measures, he, has, dissolved, representative, houses, repeatedly, for, opposing, with, manly, firmness, of, his, invasions, on, the, rights, of, the, people, he, has, refused, for, a, long, time, after, such, dissolutions, to, cause, others, to, be, elected, whereby, the, legislative, powers, incapable, of, annihilation, have, returned, to, the, people, at, large, for, their, exercise, the, state, remaining, in, the, meantime, exposed, to, all, the, dangers, of, invasion, from, without, and, convulsions, within, he, has, endeavoured, to, prevent, the, population, of, these, states, for, that, purpose, obstructing, the, laws, for, naturalization, of, foreigners, refusing, to, pass, others, to, encourage, their, migrations, hither, and, raising, the, conditions, of, new, appropriations, of, lands, he, has, obstructed, the, administration, of, justice, by, refusing, his, assent, to, laws, for, establishing, judiciary, powers, he, has, made, judges, dependent, on, his, will, alone, for, the, tenure, of, their, offices, and, the, amount, and, payment, of, their, salaries, he, has, erected, a, multitude, of, new, offices, and, sent, hither, swarms, of, officers, to, harass, our, people, and, eat, out, their, substance, he, has, kept, among, us, in, times, of, peace, standing, armies, without, the, consent, of, our, legislatures, he, has, affected, to, render, the, military, independent, of, and, superior, to, the, civil, power, he, has, combined, with, others, to, subject, us, to, a, jurisdiction, foreign, to, our, constitution, and, unacknowledged, by, our, laws, giving, his, assent, to, their, acts, of, pretended, legislation, for, quartering, large, bodies, of, armed, troops, among, us, for, protecting, them, by, a, mock, trial, from, punishment, for, any, murders, which, they, should, commit, on, the, inhabitants, of, these, states, for, cutting, off, our, trade, with, all, parts, of, the, world, for, imposing, taxes, on, us, without, our, consent, for, depriving, us, in, many, cases, of, the, benefit, of, trial, by, jury, for, transporting, us, beyond, seas, to, be, tried, for, pretended, offences, for, abolishing, the, free, system, of, english, laws, in, a, neighbouring, province, establishing, therein, an, arbitrary, government, and, enlarging, its, boundaries, so, as, to, render, it, at, once, an, example, and, fit, instrument, for, introducing, the, same, absolute, rule, into, these, colonies, for, taking, away, our, charters, abolishing, our, most, valuable, laws, and, altering, fundamentally, the, forms, of, our, governments, for, suspending, our, own, legislatures, and, declaring, themselves, invested, with, power, to, legislate, for, us, in, all, cases, whatsoever, he, has, abdicated, government, here, by, declaring, us, out, of, his, protection, and, waging, war, against, us, he, has, plundered, our, seas, ravaged, our, coasts, burnt, our, towns, and, destroyed, the, lives, of, our, people, he, is, at, this, time, transporting, large, armies, of, foreign, mercenaries, to, compleat, the, works, of, death, desolation, and, tyranny, already, begun, with, circumstances, of, cruelty, perfidy, scarcely, paralleled, in, the, most, barbarous, ages, and, totally, unworthy, the, head, of, a, civilized, nation, he, has, constrained, our, fellow, citizens, taken, captive, on, the, high, seas, to, bear, arms, against, their, country, to, become, the, executioners, of, their, friends, and, brethren, or, to, fall, themselves, by, their, hands, he, has, excited, domestic, insurrections, amongst, us, and, has, endeavoured, to, bring, on, the, inhabitants, of, our, frontiers, the, merciless, indian, savages, whose, known, rule, of, warfare, is, an, undistinguished, destruction, of, all, ages, sexes, and, conditions, in, every, stage, of, these, oppressions, we, have, petitioned, for, redress, in, the, most, humble, terms, our, repeated, petitions, have, been, answered, only, by, repeated, injury, a, prince, whose, character, is, thus, marked, by, every, act, which, may, define, a, tyrant, is, unfit, to, be, the, ruler, of, a, free, people, describes, the, colonists, attempts, to, inform, and, warn, the, british, people, of, the, king, s, injustice, and, the, british, people, s, failure, to, act, even, so, it, affirms, the, colonists, ties, to, the, british, as, brethren, nor, have, we, been, wanting, in, attentions, to, our, british, brethren, we, have, warned, them, from, time, to, time, of, attempts, by, their, legislature, to, extend, an, unwarrantable, jurisdiction, over, us, we, have, reminded, them, of, the, circumstances, of, our, emigration, and, settlement, here, we, have, appealed, to, their, native, justice, and, magnanimity, and, we, have, conjured, them, by, the, ties, of, our, common, kindred, to, disavow, these, usurpations, which, would, inevitably, interrupt, our, connections, and, correspondence, they, too, have, been, deaf, to, the, voice, of, justice, and, of, consanguinity, this, section, essentially, finishes, the, case, for, independence, the, conditions, that, justified, revolution, have, been, shown, we, must, therefore, acquiesce, in, the, necessity, which, denounces, our, separation, and, hold, them, as, we, hold, the, rest, of, mankind, enemies, in, war, in, peace, friends, the, signers, assert, that, there, exist, conditions, under, which, people, must, change, their, government, that, the, british, have, produced, such, conditions, and, by, necessity, the, colonies, must, throw, off, political, ties, with, the, british, crown, and, become, independent, states, the, conclusion, contains, at, its, core, the, lee, resolution, that, had, been, passed, on, july, 2, we, therefore, the, representatives, of, the, united, states, of, america, in, general, congress, assembled, appealing, to, the, supreme, judge, of, the, world, for, the, rectitude, of, our, intentions, do, in, the, name, and, by, authority, of, the, good, people, of, these, colonies, solemnly, publish, and, declare, that, these, united, colonies, are, and, of, right, ought, to, be, free, and, independent, states, that, they, are, absolved, from, all, allegiance, to, the, british, crown, and, that, all, political, connection, between, them, and, the, state, of, great, britain, is, and, ought, to, be, totally, dissolved, and, that, as, free, and, independent, states, they, have, full, power, to, levy, war, conclude, peace, contract, alliances, establish, commerce, and, to, do, all, other, acts, and, things, which, independent, states, may, of, right, do, and, for, the, support, of, this, declaration, with, a, firm, reliance, on, the, protection, of, divine, providence, we, mutually, pledge, to, each, other, our, lives, our, fortunes, and, our, sacred, honor, the, first, and, most, famous, signature, on, the, engrossed, copy, was, that, of, john, hancock, president, of, the, continental, congress, two, future, presidents, thomas, jefferson, and, john, adams, and, a, father, and, great, grandfather, of, two, other, presidents, benjamin, harrison, v, were, among, the, signatories, edward, rutledge, age, 26, was, the, youngest, signer, and, benjamin, franklin, age, 70, was, the, oldest, signer, the, fifty, six, signers, of, the, declaration, represented, the, new, states, as, follows, from, north, to, south, the, version, of, the, signed, document, that, people, saw, at, the, time, was, also, signed, by, mary, katherine, goddard, she, was, the, postmaster, of, baltimore, and, was, tasked, by, the, continental, congress, with, printing, the, signed, declaration, her, normal, signature, in, her, capacity, as, the, owner, of, the, maryland, journal, was, m, k, goddard, but, she, signed, the, declaration, of, independence, with, her, full, name, historians, have, often, sought, to, identify, the, sources, that, most, influenced, the, words, and, political, philosophy, of, the, declaration, of, independence, by, jefferson, s, own, admission, the, declaration, contained, no, original, ideas, but, was, instead, a, statement, of, sentiments, widely, shared, by, supporters, of, the, american, revolution, as, he, explained, in, 1825, neither, aiming, at, originality, of, principle, or, sentiment, nor, yet, copied, from, any, particular, and, previous, writing, it, was, intended, to, be, an, expression, of, the, american, mind, and, to, give, to, that, expression, the, proper, tone, and, spirit, called, for, by, the, occasion, jefferson, s, most, immediate, sources, were, two, documents, written, in, june, 1776, his, own, draft, of, the, preamble, of, the, constitution, of, virginia, and, george, mason, s, draft, of, the, virginia, declaration, of, rights, ideas, and, phrases, from, both, of, these, documents, appear, in, the, declaration, of, independence, 125, 126, mason, s, opening, was, section, 1, that, all, men, are, by, nature, equally, free, and, independent, and, have, certain, inherent, rights, of, which, when, they, enter, into, a, state, of, society, they, cannot, by, any, compact, deprive, or, divest, their, posterity, namely, the, enjoyment, of, life, and, liberty, with, the, means, of, acquiring, and, possessing, property, and, pursuing, and, obtaining, happiness, and, safety, mason, was, in, turn, directly, influenced, by, the, 1689, english, declaration, of, rights, which, formally, ended, the, reign, of, king, james, ii, 126, 128, during, the, american, revolution, jefferson, and, other, americans, looked, to, the, english, declaration, of, rights, as, a, model, of, how, to, end, the, reign, of, an, unjust, king, 53, 57, the, scottish, declaration, of, arbroath, 1320, and, the, dutch, act, of, abjuration, 1581, have, also, been, offered, as, models, for, jefferson, s, declaration, but, these, models, are, now, accepted, by, few, scholars, maier, found, no, evidence, that, the, dutch, act, of, abjuration, served, as, a, model, for, the, declaration, and, considers, the, argument, unpersuasive, 264, armitage, discounts, the, influence, of, the, scottish, and, dutch, acts, and, writes, that, neither, was, called, declarations, of, independence, until, fairly, recently, 42, 44, stephen, e, lucas, argued, in, favor, of, the, influence, of, the, dutch, act, jefferson, wrote, that, a, number, of, authors, exerted, a, general, influence, on, the, words, of, the, declaration, english, political, theorist, john, locke, is, usually, cited, as, one, of, the, primary, influences, a, man, whom, jefferson, called, one, of, the, three, greatest, men, that, have, ever, lived, in, 1922, historian, carl, l, becker, wrote, most, americans, had, absorbed, locke, s, works, as, a, kind, of, political, gospel, and, the, declaration, in, its, form, in, its, phraseology, follows, closely, certain, sentences, in, locke, s, second, treatise, on, government, 27, the, extent, of, locke, s, influence, on, the, american, revolution, has, been, questioned, by, some, subsequent, scholars, however, historian, ray, forrest, harvey, argued, in, 1937, for, the, dominant, influence, of, swiss, jurist, jean, jacques, burlamaqui, declaring, that, jefferson, and, locke, were, at, two, opposite, poles, in, their, political, philosophy, as, evidenced, by, jefferson, s, use, in, the, declaration, of, independence, of, the, phrase, pursuit, of, happiness, instead, of, property, other, scholars, emphasized, the, influence, of, republicanism, rather, than, locke, s, classical, liberalism, historian, garry, wills, argued, that, jefferson, was, influenced, by, the, scottish, enlightenment, particularly, francis, hutcheson, rather, than, locke, an, interpretation, that, has, been, strongly, criticized, legal, historian, john, phillip, reid, has, written, that, the, emphasis, on, the, political, philosophy, of, the, declaration, has, been, misplaced, the, declaration, is, not, a, philosophical, tract, about, natural, rights, argues, reid, but, is, instead, a, legal, document, an, indictment, against, king, george, for, violating, the, constitutional, rights, of, the, colonists, as, such, it, follows, the, process, of, the, 1550, magdeburg, confession, which, legitimized, resistance, against, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, in, a, multi, step, legal, formula, now, known, as, the, doctrine, of, the, lesser, magistrate, historian, david, armitage, has, argued, that, the, declaration, was, strongly, influenced, by, de, vattel, s, the, law, of, nations, the, dominant, international, law, treatise, of, the, period, and, a, book, that, benjamin, franklin, said, was, continually, in, the, hands, of, the, members, of, our, congress, armitage, writes, vattel, made, independence, fundamental, to, his, definition, of, statehood, therefore, the, primary, purpose, of, the, declaration, was, to, express, the, international, legal, sovereignty, of, the, united, states, if, the, united, states, were, to, have, any, hope, of, being, recognized, by, the, european, powers, the, american, revolutionaries, first, had, to, make, it, clear, that, they, were, no, longer, dependent, on, great, britain, 21, 38, 40, the, declaration, of, independence, does, not, have, the, force, of, law, domestically, but, nevertheless, it, may, help, to, provide, historical, and, legal, clarity, about, the, constitution, and, other, laws, the, declaration, became, official, when, congress, recorded, its, vote, adopting, the, document, on, july, 4, it, was, transposed, on, paper, and, signed, by, john, hancock, president, of, the, congress, on, that, day, signatures, of, the, other, delegates, were, not, needed, to, further, authenticate, it, the, signatures, of, fifty, six, delegates, are, affixed, to, the, declaration, though, the, exact, date, when, each, person, signed, became, debatable, jefferson, franklin, and, adams, all, wrote, that, the, declaration, was, signed, by, congress, on, july, 4, but, in, 1796, signer, thomas, mckean, disputed, that, because, some, signers, were, not, then, present, including, several, who, were, not, even, elected, to, congress, until, after, that, date, historians, have, generally, accepted, mckean, s, version, of, events, history, particularly, shows, most, delegates, signed, on, august, 2, 1776, and, those, who, were, not, then, present, added, their, names, later, in, an, 1811, letter, to, adams, benjamin, rush, recounted, the, signing, on, august, 2, in, stark, fashion, describing, it, as, a, scene, of, pensive, and, awful, silence, rush, said, the, delegates, were, called, up, one, after, another, and, then, filed, forward, somberly, to, subscribe, what, each, thought, was, their, ensuing, death, warrant, he, related, that, the, gloom, of, the, morning, was, briefly, interrupted, when, the, rotund, benjamin, harrison, of, virginia, said, to, a, diminutive, elbridge, gerry, of, massachusetts, at, the, signing, table, i, shall, have, a, great, advantage, over, you, mr, gerry, when, we, are, all, hung, for, what, we, are, now, doing, from, the, size, and, weight, of, my, body, i, shall, die, in, a, few, minutes, and, be, with, the, angels, but, from, the, lightness, of, your, body, you, will, dance, in, the, air, an, hour, or, two, before, you, are, dead, according, to, rush, harrison, s, remark, procured, a, transient, smile, but, it, was, soon, succeeded, by, the, solemnity, with, which, the, whole, business, was, conducted, the, signatories, include, then, future, presidents, john, adams, and, thomas, jefferson, though, the, most, legendary, signature, is, john, hancock, s, his, large, flamboyant, signature, became, iconic, and, the, term, john, hancock, emerged, in, the, united, states, as, a, metaphor, of, signature, a, commonly, circulated, but, apocryphal, account, claims, that, after, hancock, signed, the, delegate, from, massachusetts, commented, the, british, ministry, can, read, that, name, without, spectacles, another, report, indicates, that, hancock, proudly, declared, there, i, guess, king, george, will, be, able, to, read, that, a, legend, emerged, years, later, about, the, signing, of, the, declaration, after, the, document, had, become, an, important, national, symbol, john, hancock, is, supposed, to, have, said, that, congress, having, signed, the, declaration, must, now, all, hang, together, and, benjamin, franklin, replied, yes, we, must, indeed, all, hang, together, or, most, assuredly, we, shall, all, hang, separately, that, quotation, first, appeared, in, print, in, an, 1837, london, humor, magazine, the, syng, inkstand, used, at, the, signing, was, also, used, at, the, signing, of, the, united, states, constitution, in, 1787, after, congress, approved, the, final, wording, of, the, declaration, on, july, 4, a, handwritten, copy, was, sent, a, few, blocks, away, to, the, printing, shop, of, john, dunlap, through, the, night, dunlap, printed, about, 200, broadsides, for, distribution, the, source, copy, used, for, this, printing, has, been, lost, and, may, have, been, a, copy, in, thomas, jefferson, s, hand, it,

denounced, the, signers, of, the, declaration, for, not, applying, the, same, principles, of, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, to, african, americans, thomas, hutchinson, the, former, royal, governor, of, massachusetts, also, published, a, rebuttal, 74, these, pamphlets, challenged, various, aspects, of, the, declaration, hutchinson, argued, that, the, american, revolution, was, the, work, of, a, few, conspirators, who, wanted, independence, from, the, outset, and, who, had, finally, achieved, it, by, inducing, otherwise, loyal, colonists, to, rebel, 155, 156, lind, s, pamphlet, had, an, anonymous, attack, on, the, concept, of, natural, rights, written, by, jeremy, bentham, an, argument, that, he, repeated, during, the, french, revolution, 79, 80, both, pamphlets, questioned, how, the, american, slaveholders, in, congress, could, proclaim, that, all, men, are, created, equal, without, freeing, their, own, slaves, 76, 77, william, whipple, a, signer, of, the, declaration, of, independence, who, had, fought, in, the, war, freed, his, slave, prince, whipple, because, of, his, revolutionary, ideals, in, the, postwar, decades, other, slaveholders, also, freed, their, slaves, from, 1790, to, 1810, the, percentage, of, free, blacks, in, the, upper, south, increased, to, 8, 3, percent, from, less, than, one, percent, of, the, black, population, northern,

declaration, of, independence, was, the, one, printed, on, july, 4, 1776, under, jefferson, s, supervision, it, was, sent, to, the, states, and, to, the, army, and, was, widely, reprinted, in, newspapers, the, slightly, different, engrossed, copy, shown, at, the, top, of, this, article, was, made, later, for, members, to, sign, the, engrossed, version, is, the, one, widely, distributed, in, the, 21st, century, note, that, the, opening, lines, differ, between, the, two, versions, the, copy, of, the, declaration, that, was, signed, by, congress, is, known, as, the, engrossed, or, parchment, copy, it, was, probably, engrossed, that, is, carefully, handwritten, by, clerk, timothy, matlack, a, facsimile, made, in, 1823, has, become, the, basis, of, most, modern, reproductions, rather, than, the, original, because, of, poor, conservation, of, the, engrossed, copy, through, the, 19th, century, in, 1921, custody, of, the, engrossed, copy, of, the, declaration, was, transferred, from, the, state, department, to, the, library, of, congress, along, with, the, united, states, constitution, after, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, in, 1941, the, documents, were, moved, for, safekeeping, to, the, united, states, bullion, depository, at, fort, knox, in, kentucky, where, they, were, kept, until, 1944, in, 1952, the, engrossed, declaration, was, transferred, to, the, national, archives, and, is, now, on, permanent, display, at, the, national, archives, in, the, rotunda, for, the, charters, of, freedom, the, document, signed, by, congress, and, enshrined, in, the, national, archives, is, usually, regarded, as, the, declaration, of, independence, but, historian, julian, p, boyd, argued, that, the, declaration, like, magna, carta, is, not, a, single, document, boyd, considered, the, printed, broadsides, ordered, by, congress, to, be, official, texts, as, well, the, declaration, was, first, published, as, a, broadside, that, was, printed, the, night, of, july, 4, by, john, dunlap, of, philadelphia, dunlap, printed, about, 200, broadsides, of, which, 26, are, known, to, survive, the, 26th, copy, was, discovered, in, the, national, archives, in, england, in, 2009, in, 1777, congress, commissioned, mary, katherine, goddard, to, print, a, new, broadside, that, listed, the, signers, of, the, declaration, unlike, the, dunlap, broadside, nine, copies, of, the, goddard, broadside, are, known, to, still, exist, a, variety, of, broadsides, printed, by, the, states, are, also, extant, including, seven, copies, of, the, solomon, southwick, broadside, one, of, which, was, acquired, by, washington, university, in, st, louis, in, 2015, several, early, handwritten, copies, and, drafts, of, the, declaration, have, also, been, preserved, jefferson, kept, a, four, page, draft, that, late, in, life, he, called, the, original, rough, draught, historians, now, understand, that, jefferson, s, rough, draft, was, one, in, a, series, of, drafts, used, by, the, committee, of, five, before, being, submitted, to, congress, for, deliberation, according, to, boyd, the, first, original, handwritten, draft, of, the, declaration, of, independence, that, predated, jefferson, s, rough, draft, was, lost, or, destroyed, during, the, drafting, process, it, is, not, known, how, many, drafts, jefferson, wrote, prior, to, this, one, and, how, much, of, the, text, was, contributed, by, other, committee, members, in, 1947, boyd, discovered, a, fragment, of, an, earlier, draft, in, jefferson, s, handwriting, that, predates, jefferson, s, rough, draft, in, 2018, the, thomas, paine, national, historical, association, published, findings, on, an, additional, early, handwritten, draft, of, the, declaration, referred, to, as, the, sherman, copy, that, john, adams, copied, from, the, lost, original, draft, for, committee, of, five, members, roger, sherman, and, benjamin, franklin, s, initial, review, an, inscription, on, the, document, noting, a, beginning, perhaps, the, early, state, of, the, text, and, the, manner, in, which, this, document, was, hastily, taken, appears, to, chronologically, place, this, draft, earlier, than, both, the, fair, adams, copy, held, in, the, massachusetts, historical, society, collection, and, the, jefferson, rough, draft, after, the, text, was, finalized, by, congress, as, a, whole, jefferson, and, adams, sent, copies, of, the, rough, draft, to, friends, with, variations, noted, from, the, original, drafts, during, the, writing, process, jefferson, showed, the, rough, draft, to, adams, and, franklin, and, perhaps, to, other, members, of, the, drafting, committee, who, made, a, few, more, changes, franklin, for, example, may, have, been, responsible, for, changing, jefferson, s, original, phrase, we, hold, these, truths, to, be, sacred, and, undeniable, to, we, hold, these, truths, to, be, self, evident, 1, 427, 28, jefferson, incorporated, these, changes, into, a, copy, that, was, submitted, to, congress, in, the, name, of, the, committee, the, copy, that, was, submitted, to, congress, on, june, 28, has, been, lost, and, was, perhaps, destroyed, in, the, printing, process, or, destroyed, during, the, debates, in, accordance, with, congress, s, secrecy, rule, on, april, 21, 2017, it, was, announced, that, a, second, engrossed, copy, had, been, discovered, in, the, archives, at, west, sussex, county, council, in, chichester, england, named, by, its, finders, the, sussex, declaration, it, differs, from, the, national, archives, copy, which, the, finders, refer, to, as, the, matlack, declaration, in, that, the, signatures, on, it, are, not, grouped, by, states, how, it, came, to, be, in, england, is, not, yet, known, but, the, finders, believe, that, the, randomness, of, the, signatures, points, to, an, origin, with, signatory, james, wilson, who, had, argued, strongly, that, the, declaration, was, made, not, by, the, states, but, by, the, whole, people, years, of, exposure, to, damaging, lighting, resulted, in, the, original, declaration, of, independence, document, having, much, of, its, ink, fade, by, 1876, the, declaration, was, given, little, attention, in, the, years, immediately, following, the, american, revolution, having, served, its, original, purpose, in, announcing, the, independence, of, the, united, states, 87, 88, 162, 168, 169, early, celebrations, of, independence, day, largely, ignored, the, declaration, as, did, early, histories, of, the, revolution, the, act, of, declaring, independence, was, considered, important, whereas, the, text, announcing, that, act, attracted, little, attention, 160, the, declaration, was, rarely, mentioned, during, the, debates, about, the, united, states, constitution, and, its, language, was, not, incorporated, into, that, document, 92, george, mason, s, draft, of, the, virginia, declaration, of, rights, was, more, influential, and, its, language, was, echoed, in, state, constitutions, and, state, bills, of, rights, more, often, than, jefferson, s, words, 90, 165, 167, in, none, of, these, documents, wrote, pauline, maier, is, there, any, evidence, whatsoever, that, the, declaration, of, independence, lived, in, men, s, minds, as, a, classic, statement, of, american, political, principles, 167, many, leaders, of, the, french, revolution, admired, the, declaration, of, independence, 167, but, were, also, interested, in, the, new, american, state, constitutions, 82, the, inspiration, and, content, of, the, french, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, 1789, emerged, largely, from, the, ideals, of, the, american, revolution, lafayette, prepared, its, key, drafts, working, closely, in, paris, with, his, friend, thomas, jefferson, it, also, borrowed, language, from, george, mason, s, virginia, declaration, of, rights, the, declaration, also, influenced, the, russian, empire, and, it, had, a, particular, impact, on, the, decembrist, revolt, and, other, russian, thinkers, according, to, historian, david, armitage, the, declaration, of, independence, did, prove, to, be, internationally, influential, but, not, as, a, statement, of, human, rights, armitage, argues, that, the, declaration, was, the, first, in, a, new, genre, of, declarations, of, independence, which, announced, the, creation, of, new, states, other, french, leaders, were, directly, influenced, by, the, text, of, the, declaration, of, independence, itself, the, manifesto, of, the, province, of, flanders, 1790, was, the, first, foreign, derivation, of, the, declaration, 113, others, include, the, venezuelan, declaration, of, independence, 1811, the, liberian, declaration, of, independence, 1847, the, declarations, of, secession, by, the, confederate, states, of, america, 1860, 61, and, the, vietnamese, proclamation, of, independence, 1945, 120, 135, these, declarations, echoed, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, in, announcing, the, independence, of, a, new, state, without, necessarily, endorsing, the, political, philosophy, of, the, original, 104, 113, other, countries, have, used, the, declaration, as, inspiration, or, have, directly, copied, sections, from, it, these, include, the, haitian, declaration, of, january, 1, 1804, during, the, haitian, revolution, the, united, provinces, of, new, granada, in, 1811, the, argentine, declaration, of, independence, in, 1816, the, chilean, declaration, of, independence, in, 1818, costa, rica, in, 1821,

borglum, among, the, drafters, the, rhodesian, declaration, of, independence, is, based, on, the, american, one, as, well, ratified, in, november, 1965, although, it, omits, the, phrases, all, men, are, created, equal, and, the, consent, of, the, governed, the, south, carolina, declaration, of, secession, from, december, 1860, also, mentions, the, u, s, declaration, of, independence, though, it, omits, references, to, all, men, are, created, equal, and, consent, of, the, governed, interest, in, the, declaration, was, revived, in, the, 1790s, with, the, emergence, of, the, united, states, s, first, political, parties, throughout, the, 1780s, few, americans, knew, or, cared, who, wrote, the, declaration, but, in, the, next, decade, jeffersonian, republicans, sought, political, advantage, over, their, rival, federalists, by, promoting, both, the, importance, of, the, declaration, and, jefferson, as, its, author, 168, 171, federalists, responded, by, casting, doubt, on, jefferson, s, authorship, or, originality, and, by, emphasizing, that, independence, was, declared, by, the, whole, congress, with, jefferson, as, just, one, member, of, the, drafting, committee, federalists, insisted, that, congress, s, act, of, declaring, independence, in, which, federalist, john, adams, had, played, a, major, role, was, more, important, than, the, document, announcing, it, 171, but, this, view, faded, away, like, the, federalist, party, itself, and, before, long, the, act, of, declaring, independence, became, synonymous, with, the, document, a, less, partisan, appreciation, for, the, declaration, emerged, in, the, years, following, the, war, of, 1812, thanks, to, a, growing, american, nationalism, and, a, renewed, interest, in, the, history, of, the, revolution, 571, 572, 175, 178, in, 1817, congress, commissioned, john, trumbull, s, famous, painting, of, the, signers, which, was, exhibited, to, large, crowds, before, being, installed, in, the, capitol, 572, 175, the, earliest, commemorative, printings, of, the, declaration, also, appeared, at, this, time, offering, many, americans, their, first, view, of, the, signed, document, 572, 175, 176, collective, biographies, of, the, signers, were, first, published, in, the, 1820s, 176, giving, birth, to, what, garry, wills, called, the, cult, of, the, signers, in, the, years, that, followed, many, stories, about, the, writing, and, signing, of, the, document, were, published, for, the, first, time, when, interest, in, the, declaration, was, revived, the, sections, that, were, most, important, in, 1776, were, no, longer, relevant, the, announcement, of, the, independence, of, the, united, states, and, the, grievances, against, king, george, but, the, second, paragraph, was, applicable, long, after, the, war, had, ended, with, its, talk, of, self, evident, truths, and, unalienable, rights, 93, the, identity, of, natural, law, since, the, 18th, century, has, seen, increasing, ascendancy, towards, political, and, moral, norms, versus, the, law, of, nature, god, or, human, nature, as, seen, in, the, past, the, constitution, and, the, bill, of, rights, lacked, sweeping, statements, about, rights, and, equality, and, advocates, of, groups, with, grievances, turned, to, the, declaration, for, support, 196, 197, starting, in, the, 1820s, variations, of, the, declaration, were, issued, to, proclaim, the, rights, of, workers, farmers, women, and, others, 197, in, 1848, for, example, the, seneca, falls, convention, of, women, s, rights, advocates, declared, that, all, men, and, women, are, created, equal, 197, 95, john, trumbull, s, painting, declaration, of, independence, has, played, a, significant, role, in, popular, conceptions, of, the, declaration, of, independence, the, painting, is, 12, by, 18, foot, 3, 7, by, 5, 5, m, in, size, and, was, commissioned, by, the, united, states, congress, in, 1817, it, has, hung, in, the, united, states, capitol, rotunda, since, 1826, it, is, sometimes, described, as, the, signing, of, the, declaration, of, independence, but, it, actually, shows, the, committee, of, five, presenting, their, draft, of, the, declaration, to, the, second, continental, congress, on, june, 28, 1776, and, not, the, signing, of, the, document, which, took, place, later, trumbull, painted, the, figures, from, life, whenever, possible, but, some, had, died, and, images, could, not, be, located, hence, the, painting, does, not, include, all, the, signers, of, the, declaration, one, figure, had, participated, in, the, drafting, but, did, not, sign, the, final, document, another, refused, to, sign, in, fact, the, membership, of, the, second, continental, congress, changed, as, time, passed, and, the, figures, in, the, painting, were, never, in, the, same, room, at, the, same, time, it, is, however, an, accurate, depiction, of, the, room, in, independence, hall, the, centerpiece, of, the, independence, national, historical, park, in, philadelphia, pennsylvania, trumbull, s, painting, has, been, depicted, multiple, times, on, u, s, currency, and, postage, stamps, its, first, use, was, on, the, reverse, side, of, the, 100, national, bank, note, issued, in, 1863, a, few, years, later, the, steel, engraving, used, in, printing, the, bank, notes, was, used, to, produce, a, 24, cent, stamp, issued, as, part, of, the, 1869, pictorial, issue, an, engraving, of, the, signing, scene, has, been, featured, on, the, reverse, side, of, the, united, states, two, dollar, bill, since, 1976, the, apparent, contradiction, between, the, claim, that, all, men, are, created, equal, and, the, existence, of, slavery, in, the, united, states, attracted, comment, when, the, declaration, was, first, published, many, of, the, founders, understood, the, incompatibility, of, the, statement, of, natural, equality, with, the, institution, of, slavery, but, continued, to, enjoy, the, rights, of, man, jefferson, had, included, a, paragraph, in, his, initial, rough, draft, of, the, declaration, of, independence, vigorously, condemning, the, evil, of, the, slave, trade, and, condemning, king, george, iii, for, forcing, it, onto, the, colonies, but, this, was, deleted, from, the, final, version, 146, 150, he, has, waged, cruel, war, against, human, nature, itself, violating, its, most, sacred, rights, of, life, and, liberty, in, the, persons, of,

sold, he, has, prostituted, his, negative, for, suppressing, every, legislative, attempt, to, prohibit, or, to, restrain, this, execrable, commerce, and, that, this, assemblage, of, horrors, might, want, no, fact, of, distinguished, die, he, is, now, exciting, those, very, people, to, rise, in, arms, among, us, and, to, purchase, that, liberty, of, which, he, had, deprived, them, by, murdering, the, people, upon, whom, he, also, obtruded, them, thus, paying, off, former, crimes, committed, against, the, liberties, of, one, people, with, crimes, which, he, urges, them, to, commit, against, the, lives, of, another, jefferson, himself, was, a, prominent, virginia, slaveowner, owning, six, hundred, enslaved, africans, on, his, monticello, plantation, referring, to, this, contradiction, english, abolitionist, thomas, day, wrote, in, a, 1776, letter, if, there, be, an, object, truly, ridiculous, in, nature, it, is, an, american, patriot, signing, resolutions, of, independency, with, the, one, hand, and, with, the, other, brandishing, a, whip, over, his, affrighted, slaves, the, african, american, writer, lemuel, haynes, expressed, similar, viewpoints, in, his, essay, liberty, further, extended, where, he, wrote, that, liberty, is, equally, as, pre, ious, to, a, black, man, as, it, is, to, a, white, one, in, the, 19th, century, the, declaration, took, on, a, special, significance, for, the, abolitionist, movement, historian, bertram, wyatt, brown, wrote, that, abolitionists, tended, to, interpret, the, declaration, of, independence, as, a, theological, as, well, as, a, political, document, abolitionist, leaders, benjamin, lundy, and, william, lloyd, garrison, adopted, the, twin, rocks, of, the, bible, and, the, declaration, of, independence, as, the, basis, for, their, philosophies, he, wrote, as, long, as, there, remains, a, single, copy, of, the, declaration, of, independence, or, of, the, bible, in, our, land, we, will, not, despair, for, radical, abolitionists, such, as, garrison, the, most, important, part, of, the, declaration, was, its, assertion, of, the, right, of, revolution, garrison, called, for, the, destruction, of, the, government, under, the, constitution, and, the, creation, of, a, new, state, dedicated, to, the, principles, of, the, declaration, 198, 199, on, july, 5, 1852, frederick, douglass, delivered, a, speech, asking, the, question, what, to, the, slave, is, the, fourth, of, july, the, controversial, question, of, whether, to, allow, additional, slave, states, into, the, united, states, coincided, with, the, growing, stature, of, the, declaration, the, first, major, public, debate, about, slavery, and, the, declaration, took, place, during, the, missouri, controversy, of, 1819, to, 1821, anti, slavery, congressmen, argued, that, the, language, of, the, declaration, indicated, that, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, had, been, opposed, to, slavery, in, principle, and, so, new, slave, states, should, not, be, added, to, the, country, 604, pro, slavery, congressmen, led, by, senator, nathaniel, macon, of, north, carolina, argued, that, the, declaration, was, not, a, part, of, the, constitution, and, therefore, had, no, relevance, to, the, question, 605, with, the, abolitionist, movement, gaining, momentum, defenders, of, slavery, such, as, john, randolph, and, john, c, calhoun, found, it, necessary, to, argue, that, the, declaration, s, assertion, that, all, men, are, created, equal, was, false, or, at, least, that, it, did, not, apply, to, black, people, 199, 246, during, the, debate, over, the, kansas, nebraska, act, in, 1853, for, example, senator, john, pettit, of, indiana, argued, that, the, statement, all, men, are, created, equal, was, not, a, self, evident, truth, but, a, self, evident, lie, 200, opponents, of, the, kansas, nebraska, act, including, salmon, p, chase, and, benjamin, wade, defended, the, declaration, and, what, they, saw, as, its, antislavery, principles, 200, 201, in, preparing, for, his, raid, on, harper, s, ferry, said, by, frederick, douglass, to, be, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, slavery, in, the, united, states, 27, 28, abolitionist, john, brown, had, many, copies, printed, of, a, provisional, constitution, when, the, seceding, states, created, the, confederate, states, of, america, 16, months, later, they, operated, for, over, a, year, under, a, provisional, constitution, it, outlines, the, three, branches, of, government, in, the, quasi, country, he, hoped, to, set, up, in, the, appalachian, mountains, it, was, widely, reproduced, in, the, press, and, in, full, in, the, select, senate, committee, report, on, john, brown, s, insurrection, the, mason, report, brown, did, not, have, it, printed, and, his, declaration, of, liberty, dated, july, 4, 1859, was, found, among, his, papers, at, the, kennedy, farm, 330, 331, it, was, written, out, on, sheets, of, paper, attached, to, fabric, to, allow, it, to, be, rolled, and, it, was, rolled, when, found, the, hand, is, that, of, owen, brown, who, often, served, as, his, father, s, amanuensis, imitating, the, vocabulary, punctuation, and, capitalization, of, the, 73, year, old, u, s, declaration, the, 2000, word, document, begins, july, 4th, 1859, when, in, the, course, of, human, events, it, becomes, necessary, for, an, oppressed, people, to, rise, and, assert, their, natural, rights, as, human, beings, as, native, mutual, citizens, of, a, free, republic, and, break, that, odious, yoke, of, oppression, which, is, so, unjustly, laid, upon, them, by, their, fellow, countrymen, and, to, assume, among, the, powers, of, earth, the, same, equal, privileges, to, which, the, laws, of, nature, natures, god, entitle, them, a, moderate, respect, for, the, opinions, of, mankind, requires, that, they, should, declare, the, causes, which, incite, them, to, this, just, worthy, action, we, hold, these, truths, to, be, self, evident, that, all, men, are, created, equal, that, they, are, endowed, by, their, creator, with, certain, unalienable, rights, that, among, these, are, life, liberty, the, persuit, of, happiness, that, nature, hath, freely, given, to, all, men, a, full, supply, of, air, water, land, for, their, sustinance, mutual, happiness, that, no, man, has, any, right, to, deprive, his, fellow, man, of, these, inherent, rights, except, in, punishment, of, crime, that, to, secure, these, rights, governments, are, instituted, among, men, deriving, their, just, powers, from, the, consent, of, the, governed, that, when, any, form, of, government, becomes, destructive, to, these, ends, it, is, the, right, of, the, people, to, alter, amend, or, remoddel, it, laying, its, foundation, on, such, principles, organizing, its, powers, in, such, form, as, to, them, shall, seem, most, likely, to, effect, the, safety, happiness, of, the, human, race, the, document, was, apparently, intended, to, be, read, aloud, but, so, far, as, is, known, brown, never, did, so, even, though, he, read, the, provisional, constitution, aloud, the, day, the, raid, on, harpers, ferry, began, 74, very, much, aware, of, the, history, of, the, american, revolution, he, would, have, read, the, declaration, aloud, after, the, revolt, had, started, the, document, was, not, published, until, 1894, and, by, someone, who, did, not, realize, its, importance, and, buried, it, in, an, appendix, of, documents, 637, 643, it, is, missing, from, most, but, not, all, studies, of, john, brown, 69, 73, the, declaration, s, relationship, to, slavery, was, taken, up, in, 1854, by, abraham, lincoln, a, little, known, former, congressman, who, idolized, the, founding, fathers, 201, 202, lincoln, thought, that, the, declaration, of, independence, expressed, the, highest, principles, of, the, american, revolution, and, that, the, founding, fathers, had, tolerated, slavery, with, the, expectation, that, it, would, ultimately, wither, away, 126, for, the, united, states, to, legitimize, the, expansion, of, slavery, in, the, kansas, nebraska, act, thought, lincoln, was, to, repudiate, the, principles, of, the, revolution, in, his, october, 1854, peoria, speech, lincoln, said, nearly, eighty, years, ago, we, began, by, declaring, that, all, men, are, created, equal, but, now, from, that, beginning, we, have, run, down, to, the, other, declaration, that, for, some, men, to, enslave, others, is, a, sacred, right, of, self, government, our, republican, robe, is, soiled, and, trailed, in, the, dust, let, us, repurify, it, let, us, re, adopt, the, declaration, of, independence, and, with, it, the, practices, and, policy, which, harmonize, with, it, if, we, do, this, we, shall, not, only, have, saved, the, union, but, we, shall, have, saved, it, as, to, make, and, keep, it, forever, worthy, of, the, saving, 126, 127, the, meaning, of, the, declaration, was, a, recurring, topic, in, the, famed, debates, between, lincoln, and, stephen, douglas, in, 1858, douglas, argued, that, the, phrase, all, men, are, created, equal, which, appears, in, the, declaration, referred, to, white, men, only, the, purpose, of, the, declaration, he, said, had, simply, been, to, justify, the, independence, of, the, united, states, and, not, to, proclaim, the, equality, of, any, inferior, or, degraded, race, 204, lincoln, however, thought, that, the, language, of, the, declaration, was, deliberately, universal, setting, a, high, moral, standard, to, which, the, american, republic, should, aspire, i, had, thought, the, declaration, contemplated, the, progressive, improvement, in, the, condition, of, all, men, everywhere, he, said, 204, 205, during, the, seventh, and, last, joint, debate, with, stephen, douglas, at, alton, illinois, on, october, 15, 1858, lincoln, said, about, the, declaration, i, think, the, authors, of, that, notable, instrument, intended, to, include, all, men, but, they, did, not, mean, to, declare, all, men, equal, in, all, respects, they, did, not, mean, to, say, all, men, were, equal, in, color, size, intellect, moral, development, or, social, capacity, they, defined, with, tolerable, distinctness, in, what, they, did, consider, all, men, created, equal, equal, in, certain, inalienable, rights, among, which, are, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, this, they, said, and, this, they, meant, they, did, not, mean, to, assert, the, obvious, untruth, that, all, were, then, actually, enjoying, that, equality, or, yet, that, they, were, about, to, confer, it, immediately, upon, them, in, fact, they, had, no, power, to, confer, such, a, boon, they, meant, simply, to, declare, the, right, so, that, the, enforcement, of, it, might, follow, as, fast, as, circumstances, should, permit, they, meant, to, set, up, a, standard, maxim, for, free, society, which, should, be, familiar, to, all, constantly, looked, to, constantly, labored, for, and, even, though, never, perfectly, attained, constantly, approximated, and, thereby, constantly, spreading, and, deepening, its, influence, and, augmenting, the, happiness, and, value, of, life, to, all, people, of, all, colors, everywhere, according, to, pauline, maier, douglas, s, interpretation, was, more, historically, accurate, but, lincoln, s, view, ultimately, prevailed, in, lincoln, s, hands, wrote, maier, the, declaration, of, independence, became, first, and, foremost, a, living, document, with, a, set, of, goals, to, be, realized, over, time, 207, here, is, no, reason, in, the, world, why, the, negro, is, not, entitled, to, all, the, natural, rights, enumerated, in, the, declaration, of, independence, the, right, to, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, i, hold, that, he, is, as, much, entitled, to, these, as, the, white, man, abraham, lincoln, 1858, 100, like, daniel, webster, james, wilson, and, joseph, story, before, him, lincoln, argued, that, the, declaration, of, independence, was, a, founding, document, of, the, united, states, and, that, this, had, important, implications, for, interpreting, the, constitution, which, had, been, ratified, more, than, a, decade, after, the, declaration, 129, 131, the, constitution, did, not, use, the, word, equality, yet, lincoln, believed, that, the, concept, that, all, men, are, created, equal, remained, a, part, of, the, nation, s, founding, principles, 145, he, famously, expressed, this, belief, referencing, the, year, 1776, in, the, opening, sentence, of, his, 1863, gettysburg, address, four, score, and, seven, years, ago, our, fathers, brought, forth, on, this, continent, a, new, nation, conceived, in, liberty, and, dedicated, to, the, proposition, that, all, men, are, created, equal, lincoln, s, view, of, the, declaration, became, influential, seeing, it, as, a, moral, guide, to, interpreting, the, constitution, for, most, people, now, wrote, garry, wills, in, 1992, the, declaration, means, what, lincoln, told, us, it, means, as, a, way, of, correcting, the, constitution, itself, without, overthrowing, it, 147, admirers, of, lincoln, such, as, harry, v, jaffa, praised, this, development, critics, of, lincoln, notably, willmoore, kendall, and, mel, bradford, argued, that, lincoln, dangerously, expanded, the, scope, of, the, national, government, and, violated, states, rights, by, reading, the, declaration, into, the, constitution, 39, 145, 146, in, july, 1848, the, seneca, falls, convention, was, held, in, seneca, falls, new, york, the, first, women, s, rights, convention, it, was, organized, by, elizabeth, cady, stanton, lucretia, mott, mary, ann, mcclintock, and, jane, hunt, they, patterned, their, declaration, of, sentiments, on, the, declaration, of, independence, in, which, they, demanded, social, and, political, equality, for, women, their, motto, was, that, all, men, and, women, are, created, equal, and, they, demanded, the, right, to, vote, excerpt, from, declaration, of, sentiments, we, hold, these, truths, to, be, self, evident, that, all, men, and, women, are, created, equal, in, 1963, in,
