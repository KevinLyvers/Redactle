military, organization, ae, or, military, organisation, be, is, the, structuring, of, the, armed, forces, of, a, state, so, as, to, offer, such, military, capability, as, a, national, defense, policy, may, require, formal, military, organization, tends, to, use, hierarchical, forms, see, modern, hierarchy, for, terminology, and, approximate, troop, strength, per, hierarchical, unit, in, some, countries, paramilitary, forces, are, included, in, a, nation, s, armed, forces, though, not, considered, military, armed, forces, that, are, not, a, part, of, military, or, paramilitary, organizations, such, as, insurgent, forces, often, emulate, military, organizations, or, use, these, structures, the, use, of, formalized, ranks, in, a, hierarchical, structure, came, into, widespread, use, with, the, roman, army, in, modern, times, executive, control, management, and, administration, of, military, organization, is, typically, undertaken, by, governments, through, a, government, department, within, the, structure, of, public, administration, often, known, as, a, ministry, of, defence, or, department, of, defense, these, in, turn, manage, military, branches, that, themselves, command, formations, and, units, specialising, in, combat, combat, support, and, combat, service, support, the, usually, civilian, or, partly, civilian, executive, control, over, the, national, military, organization, is, exercised, in, democracies, by, an, elected, political, leader, as, a, member, of, the, government, s, cabinet, usually, known, as, a, minister, of, defence, in, presidential, systems, such, as, the, united, states, the, president, is, the, commander, in, chief, and, the, cabinet, level, defense, minister, is, second, in, command, subordinated, to, that, position, are, often, secretaries, for, specific, major, operational, divisions, of, the, armed, forces, as, a, whole, such, as, those, that, provide, general, support, services, to, the, military, including, their, dependants, then, there, are, the, heads, of, specific, departmental, agencies, responsible, for, the, provision, and, management, of, specific, skill, and, knowledge, based, services, such, as, strategic, advice, capability, development, assessment, or, military, science, provision, of, research, and, design, and, development, of, technologies, within, each, departmental, agency, will, be, found, administrative, branches, responsible, for, further, agency, business, specialization, work, in, most, countries, the, armed, forces, are, divided, into, three, military, branches, also, service, armed, service, or, military, service, army, navy, and, air, force, many, countries, have, a, variation, on, the, standard, model, of, three, basic, military, branches, some, nations, also, organize, their, cyber, force, emergencies, service, medical, service, military, logistics, space, force, marines, and, special, forces, such, as, commandos, or, airborne, forces, as, independent, armed, services, a, nation, s, border, guard, or, coast, guard, may, also, be, an, independent, branch, of, its, military, although, in, many, nations, border, guard, or, coast, guard, is, a, civil, law, enforcement, agency, a, number, of, countries, have, no, navy, for, geographical, reasons, in, larger, armed, forces, the, cultures, between, the, different, branches, of, the, armed, forces, can, be, quite, different, most, smaller, countries, have, a, single, organization, that, encompasses, all, armed, forces, employed, by, the, country, in, question, armies, of, developing, countries, tend, to, consist, primarily, of, infantry, while, developed, countries, armies, tend, to, have, larger, units, manning, expensive, equipment, and, only, a, fraction, of, personnel, in, infantry, units, in, western, militaries, a, joint, force, is, defined, as, a, unit, or, formation, comprising, representation, of, combat, power, from, two, or, more, branches, of, the, military, gendarmeries, military, police, and, security, forces, including, equivalents, such, as, paramilitary, forces, militia, internal, troops, and, police, tactical, unit, are, an, internal, security, service, common, in, most, of, the, world, but, uncommon, in, countries, with, english, common, law, histories, where, civil, police, are, employed, to, enforce, the, law, and, there, are, tight, restrictions, on, how, the, armed, forces, may, be, used, to, assist, it, is, common, at, least, in, the, european, and, north, american, militaries, to, refer, to, the, building, blocks, of, a, military, as, command, s, formation, s, and, unit, s, in, a, military, context, a, command, is, a, collection, of, units, and, formations, under, the, control, of, a, single, officer, although, during, world, war, ii, a, command, was, also, a, name, given, to, a, battlegroup, in, the, united, states, army, in, general, it, is, an, administrative, and, executive, strategic, headquarters, that, is, responsible, to, the, national, government, or, the, national, military, headquarters, it, is, not, uncommon, for, a, nation, s, services, to, each, consist, of, their, own, command, such, as, land, component, air, component, naval, component, and, medical, component, in, the, belgian, army, but, this, does, not, preclude, the, existence, of, commands, that, are, not, service, based, a, formation, is, defined, by, the, u, s, department, of, defense, as, two, or, more, aircraft, ships, or, units, proceeding, together, under, a, commander, fomin, in, the, great, soviet, encyclopedia, emphasised, its, combined, arms, nature, formations, are, those, military, organisations, which, are, formed, from, different, speciality, arms, and, services, troop, units, to, create, a, balanced, combined, combat, force, the, formations, only, differ, in, their, ability, to, achieve, different, scales, of, application, of, force, to, achieve, different, strategic, operational, and, tactical, goals, and, mission, objectives, it, is, a, composite, military, organization, that, includes, a, mixture, of, integrated, and, operationally, attached, sub, units, and, is, usually, combat, capable, examples, of, formations, include, divisions, brigades, battalions, wings, etc, formation, may, also, refer, to, tactical, formation, the, physical, arrangement, or, disposition, of, troops, and, weapons, examples, of, formation, in, such, usage, include, pakfront, panzerkeil, testudo, formation, etc, a, typical, unit, is, a, homogeneous, military, organization, either, combat, combat, support, or, non, combat, in, capability, that, includes, service, personnel, predominantly, from, a, single, arm, of, service, or, a, branch, of, service, and, its, administrative, and, command, functions, are, self, contained, any, unit, subordinate, to, another, unit, is, considered, its, sub, unit, or, minor, unit, it, is, not, uncommon, in, the, united, states, for, unit, and, formation, to, be, used, synonymously, in, commonwealth, practice, formation, is, not, used, for, smaller, organizations, such, as, battalions, which, are, instead, called, units, and, their, constituent, platoons, or, companies, are, referred, to, as, sub, units, in, the, commonwealth, formations, are, divisions, brigades, etc, different, armed, forces, and, even, different, branches, of, service, of, the, armed, forces, may, use, the, same, name, to, denote, different, types, of, organizations, an, example, is, the, squadron, in, most, navies, a, squadron, is, a, formation, of, several, ships, in, most, air, forces, it, is, a, unit, in, the, u, s, army, it, is, a, battalion, sized, cavalry, unit, and, in, commonwealth, armies, a, squadron, is, a, company, sized, sub, unit, a, table, of, organization, and, equipment, toe, or, to, e, is, a, document, published, by, the, u, s, army, force, management, support, agency, that, prescribes, the, organization, manning, and, equipage, of, units, from, divisional, size, and, down, but, also, including, the, headquarters, of, corps, and, armies, it, also, provides, information, on, the, mission, and, capabilities, of, a, unit, as, well, as, the, unit, s, current, status, a, general, toe, is, applicable, to, a, type, of, unit, for, instance, infantry, rather, than, a, specific, unit, the, 3rd, infantry, division, in, this, way, all, units, of, the, same, branch, such, as, infantry, follow, the, same, structural, guidelines, the, following, table, gives, an, overview, of, some, of, the, terms, used, to, describe, army, hierarchy, in, armed, forces, across, the, world, whilst, it, is, recognized, that, there, are, differences, between, armies, of, different, nations, many, are, modeled, on, the, british, or, american, models, or, both, however, many, military, units, and, formations, go, back, in, history, for, a, long, time, and, were, devised, by, various, military, thinkers, throughout, european, history, for, example, the, modern, corps, was, first, introduced, in, france, about, 1805, by, napoleon, as, a, more, flexible, tactical, grouping, of, two, or, more, divisions, during, the, napoleonic, wars, of, 8, lieutenant, general, or, 2, private, first, class, rungs, may, be, skipped, in, this, ladder, for, example, typically, nato, forces, skip, from, battalion, to, brigade, likewise, only, large, military, powers, may, have, organizations, at, the, top, levels, and, different, armies, and, countries, may, also, use, traditional, names, creating, considerable, confusion, for, example, a, british, or, canadian, armored, regiment, battalion, is, divided, into, squadrons, companies, and, troops, platoons, whereas, an, american, cavalry, squadron, battalion, is, divided, into, troops, companies, and, platoons, in, the, french, system, used, by, many, african, countries, the, company, is, divided, into, sections, platoons, composed, of, 3, x, groupes, de, combat, of, 7, soldiers, plus, a, group, of, vehicle, crews, and, a, hq, that, includes, 2, x, snipers, army, army, group, region, and, theatre, are, all, large, formations, that, vary, significantly, between, armed, forces, in, size, and, hierarchy, position, while, divisions, were, the, traditional, level, at, which, support, elements, field, artillery, hospital, logistics, and, maintenance, etc, were, added, to, the, unit, structure, since, world, war, ii, many, brigades, now, have, such, support, units, and, since, the, 1980s, regiments, also, have, been, receiving, support, elements, a, regiment, with, such, support, elements, is, called, a, regimental, combat, team, in, us, military, parlance, or, a, battlegroup, in, the, uk, and, other, forces, canadian, army, doctrine, also, includes, the, combat, team, which, is, a, company, of, infantry, augmented, with, tanks, or, a, squadron, of, tanks, augmented, with, infantry, or, the, combination, of, a, full, company, of, infantry, with, a, full, squadron, of, tanks, during, world, war, ii, the, red, army, used, the, same, basic, organizational, structure, however, in, the, beginning, many, units, were, greatly, underpowered, and, their, size, was, actually, one, level, below, on, the, ladder, that, is, usually, used, elsewhere, for, example, a, division, in, the, early, wwii, red, army, would, have, been, about, the, size, of, most, nations, regiments, or, brigades, at, the, top, of, the, ladder, what, other, nations, would, call, an, army, group, the, red, army, called, a, front, by, contrast, during, the, same, period, the, german, wehrmacht, army, groups, particularly, on, the, eastern, front, such, as, army, group, centre, significantly, exceeded, the, above, numbers, and, were, more, cognate, with, the, soviet, strategic, directions, naval, organization, at, the, flotilla, level, and, higher, is, less, commonly, abided, by, as, ships, operate, in, smaller, or, larger, groups, in, various, situations, that, may, change, at, a, moment, s, notice, however, there, is, some, common, terminology, used, throughout, navies, to, communicate, the, general, concept, of, how, many, vessels, might, be, in, a, unit, navies, are, generally, organized, into, groups, for, a, specific, purpose, usually, strategic, and, these, organizational, groupings, appear, and, disappear, frequently, based, on, the, conditions, and, demands, placed, upon, a, navy, this, contrasts, with, army, organization, where, units, remain, static, with, the, same, men, and, equipment, over, long, periods, of, time, the, five, star, ranks, of, admiral, of, the, fleet, and, fleet, admiral, have, largely, been, out, of, regular, use, since, the, 1990s, with, the, exception, of, ceremonial, or, honorary, appointments, currently, all, major, navies, blue, water, and, green, water, navies, are, commanded, by, an, admiral, of, either, four, star, rank, or, three, star, rank, depending, on, relative, size, smaller, naval, forces, such, as, the, royal, new, zealand, navy, or, those, navies, that, are, effectively, coast, guards, are, commanded, by, a, rear, admiral, two, star, rank, commodore, one, star, rank, or, even, a, captain, aircraft, carriers, are, typically, commanded, by, a, captain, submarines, and, destroyers, are, typically, commanded, by, a, captain, or, commander, some, destroyers, particularly, smaller, destroyers, such, as, frigates, formerly, known, as, destroyer, escorts, are, usually, commanded, by, officers, with, the, rank, of, commander, corvettes, the, smallest, class, of, warship, are, commanded, by, officers, with, the, rank, of, commander, or, lieutenant, commander, auxiliary, ships, including, gunboats, minesweepers, patrol, boats, military, riverine, craft, tenders, and, torpedo, boats, are, usually, commanded, by, lieutenants, sub, lieutenants, or, warrant, officers, usually, the, smaller, the, vessel, the, lower, the, rank, of, the, ship, s, commander, for, example, patrol, boats, are, often, commanded, by, ensigns, while, frigates, are, rarely, commanded, by, an, officer, below, the, rank, of, commander, historically, navies, were, far, more, rigid, in, structure, ships, were, collected, in, divisions, which, in, turn, were, collected, in, numbered, squadrons, which, comprised, a, numbered, fleet, permission, for, a, vessel, to, leave, one, unit, and, join, another, would, have, to, be, approved, on, paper, the, modern, u, s, navy, is, primarily, based, on, a, number, of, standard, groupings, of, vessels, including, the, carrier, strike, group, and, the, expeditionary, strike, group, additionally, naval, organization, continues, aboard, a, single, ship, the, complement, forms, three, or, four, departments, such, as, tactical, and, engineering, each, of, which, has, a, number, of, divisions, followed, by, work, centers, the, organizational, structures, of, air, forces, vary, between, nations, some, air, forces, such, as, the, united, states, air, force, and, the, royal, air, force, are, divided, into, commands, groups, and, squadrons, others, such, as, the, soviet, air, force, have, an, army, style, organizational, structure, the, modern, royal, canadian, air, force, uses, air, division, as, the, formation, between, wings, and, the, entire, air, command, like, the, raf, canadian, wings, consist, of, squadrons, a, task, force, is, a, unit, or, formation, created, as, a, temporary, grouping, for, a, specific, operational, purpose, aside, from, administrative, hierarchical, forms, of, organization, that, have, evolved, since, the, early, 17th, century, in, europe, fighting, forces, have, been, grouped, for, specific, operational, purposes, into, mission, related, organizations, such, as, the, german, kampfgruppe, or, the, u, s, combat, team, army, and, task, force, navy, during, the, second, world, war, or, the, soviet, operational, manoeuvre, group, during, the, cold, war, in, the, british, and, commonwealth, armies, the, battlegroup, became, the, usual, grouping, of, companies, during, the, second, world, war, and, the, cold, war, within, nato, a, joint, task, force, jtf, would, be, such, a, temporary, grouping, that, includes, elements, from, more, than, one, armed, service, a, combined, task, force, ctf, would, be, such, a, temporary, grouping, that, includes, elements, from, more, than, one, nation, and, a, combined, joint, task, force, cjtf, would, be, such, a, temporary, grouping, that, includes, elements, of, more, than, one, armed, service, and, more, than, one, nation
