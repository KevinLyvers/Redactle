dispute, another, matter, of, debate, is, the, suspension, or, alteration, of, certain, civil, liberties, in, times, of, war, or, state, of, emergency, including, whether, and, to, what, extent, this, should, occur, the, formal, concept, of, civil, liberties, is, often, dated, back, to, magna, carta, an, english, legal, charter, agreed, in, 1215, which, in, turn, was, based, on, pre, existing, documents, namely, the, charter, of, liberties, the, constitution, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, which, applies, only, to, mainland, china, not, to, hong, kong, macau, and, taiwan, especially, its, fundamental, rights, and, duties, of, citizens, claims, to, protect, many, civil, liberties, taiwan, which, is, separated, from, mainland, china, has, its, own, constitution, although, the, 1982, constitution, guarantees, civil, liberties, the, chinese, government, usually, uses, the, subversion, of, state, power, and, protection, of, state, secrets, clauses, in, their, law, system, to, imprison, those, who, criticize, the, chinese, communist, party, ccp, and, the, state, leaders, the, fundamental, rights, embodied, in, part, iii, of, the, constitution, guarantee,

democracies, incorporated, in, the, fundamental, law, of, the, land, and, are, enforceable, in, a, court, of, law, violations, of, these, rights, result, in, punishments, as, prescribed, in, the, indian, penal, code, subject, to, discretion, of, the, judiciary, these, rights, are, neither, absolute, nor, immune, from, constitutional, amendments, they, have, been, aimed, at, overturning, the, inequalities, of, pre, independence, social, practices, specifically, they, resulted, in, abolishment, of, un, touchability, and, prohibit, discrimination, on, the, grounds, of, religion, race, caste, sex, or, place, of, birth, they, forbid, human, trafficking, and, unfree, labour, they, protect, cultural, and, educational, rights, of, ethnic, and, religious, minorities, by, allowing, them, to,

or, the, supreme, court, for, the, enforcement, of, their, fundamental, rights, it, is, not, necessary, that, the, aggrieved, party, has, to, be, the, one, to, do, so, in, public, interest, anyone, can, initiate, litigation, in, the, court, on, their, behalf, this, is, known, as, public, interest, litigation, high, court, and, supreme, court, judges, can, also, act, on, their, own, on, the, basis, of, media, reports, the, fundamental, rights, emphasize, equality, by, guaranteeing, to, all, citizens, the, access, and, use, of, public, institutions, and, protections, irrespective, of,

abolishes, untouchability, and, prohibits, begar, these, provisions, act, as, a, check, both, on, state, action, and, actions, of, private, individuals, fundamental, rights, are, not, absolute, and, are, subject, to, reasonable, restrictions, as, necessary, for, the, protection, of, national, interest, in, the, kesavananda, bharati, vs, state, of, kerala, case, the, supreme, court, ruled, that, all, provisions, of, the, constitution, including, fundamental, rights, can, be, amended, however, the, parliament, cannot, alter, the, basic, structure, of, the, constitution, like, secularism, democracy, federalism, separation, of, powers, often, called, the, basic, structure, doctrine, this, decision, is, widely, regarded, as, an, important, part, of, indian, history, in, the, 1978, maneka, gandhi, v, union, of, india, case, the, supreme, court, extended, the, doctrine, s, importance, as, superior, to, any, parliamentary, legislation, according, to, the, verdict, no, act, of, parliament, can, be, considered, a, law, if, it, violated, the, basic, structure, of, the, constitution, this, landmark, guarantee, of, fundamental, rights, was, regarded, as, a, unique, example, of, judicial, independence, in, preserving, the, sanctity, of, fundamental, rights, the, fundamental, rights, can, only, be, altered, by, a, constitutional, amendment, hence, their, inclusion, is, a, check, not, only, on, the, executive, branch, but, also, on, the, parliament, and, state, legislatures, the, imposition, of, a, state, of, emergency, may, lead, to, a, temporary, suspension, of, the, rights, conferred, by, article, 19, including, freedoms, of, speech, assembly, and, movement, etc, to, preserve, national, security, and, public, order, the, president, can, by, order, suspend, the, constitutional, written, remedies, as, well, since, 1947, japan, a, country, with, a, constitutional, monarchy, and, known, for, its, socially, conservative, society, where, change, is, gradual, has, a, constitution, with, a, seemingly, strong, bill, of, rights, at, its, core, chapter, iii, rights, and, duties, of, the, people, in, many, ways, it, resembles, the, u, s, constitution, prior, to, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, and, that, is, because, it, came, into, life, during, the, allied, occupation, of, japan, this, constitution, may, have, felt, like, a, foreign, imposition, to, the, governing, elites, but, not, to, the, ordinary, people, who, lacked, faith, in, their, discredited, leaders, and, supported, meaningful, change, in, the, abstract, the, constitution, strives, to, secure, fundamental, individual, liberties, and, rights, which, are, covered, pointedly, in, articles, 10, to, 40, most, salient, of, the, human, dignity, articles, is, article, 25, section, 1, which, guarantees, that, all, people, shall, have, the, right, to, maintain, the, minimum, standards, of, wholesome, and, cultured, living, despite, the, adoption, of, this, liberal, constitution, often, referred, as, the, postwar, constitution, sengo, kenp, or, the, peace, constitution, heiwa, kenp, the, japanese, governing, elites, have, struggled, to, usher, in, an, inclusive, open, and, pluralist, society, even, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, the, departure, of, the, allied, government, of, occupation, in, 1952, japan, has, been, the, target, of, international, criticism, for, failing, to, admit, to, war, crimes, institutional, religious, discrimination, and, maintaining, a, weak, freedom, of, the, press, the, treatment, of, children, minorities, foreigners, and, women, its, punitive, criminal, justice, system, and, more, recently, the, systematic, bias, against, lgbt, people, the, first, japanese, attempt, to, a, bill, of, rights, was, in, the, 19th, century, meiji, constitution, 1890, which, took, both, the, prussian, 1850, and, british, constitutions, as, basic, models, however, it, had, but, a, meager, influence, in, the, practice, of, the, rule, of, law, as, well, as, in, people, s, daily, living, so, the, short, and, deliberately, gradual, history, of, struggles, for, personal, rights, and, protection, against, government, society, s, impositions, has, yet, to, transform, japan, into, a, champion, of, universal, and, individual, freedom, according, to, constitutional, scholar, shigenori, matsui, people, tend, to, view, the, bill, of, rights, as, a, moral, imperative, and, not, as, a, judicial, norm, the, people, also, tend, to, rely, upon, bureaucrats, to, remedy, social, problems, including, even, human, rights, violations, rather, than, the, court, despite, the, divergences, between, japan, s, social, culture, and, the, liberal, constitutionalism, that, it, purports, to, have, adopted, the, country, has, moved, toward, closing, the, gap, between, the, notion, and, the, practice, of, the, law, the, trend, is, more, evident, in, the, long, term, among, several, examples, the, diet, bicameral, legislature, ratified, the, international, bill, of, human, rights, in, 1979, and, then, it, passed, the, law, for, equal, opportunity, in, employment, for, men, and, women, in, 1985, measures, that, were, heralded, as, major, steps, toward, a, democratic, and, participatory, society, in, 2015, moreover, it, reached, an, agreement, with, korea, to, compensate, for, abuses, related, to, the, so, called, women, of, comfort, that, took, place, during, the, japanese, occupation, of, the, peninsula, however, human, rights, group, and, families, of, the, survivors, condemned, the, agreement, as, patronizing, and, insulting, on, its, official, site, the, japanese, government, has, identified, various, human, rights, problems, among, these, are, child, abuses, e, g, bullying, corporal, punishment, child, sexual, abuse, child, prostitution, and, child, pornography, frequent, neglect, and, ill, treatment, of, elderly, persons, and, individuals, with, disabilities, dowa, claims, discrimination, against, the, burakumin, ainu, people, indigenous, people, in, japan, foreign, nationals, hiv, aids, carriers, hansen, s, disease, patients, persons, released, from, prison, after, serving, their, sentence, crime, victims, people, whose, human, rights, are, violated, using, the, internet, the, homeless, individuals, with, gender, identity, disorders, and, women, also, the, government, lists, systematic, problems, with, gender, biases, and, the, standard, reference, to, sexual, preferences, for, jobs, and, other, functions, in, society, human, rights, organizations, national, and, foreign, expand, the, list, to, include, human, rights, violations, that, relate, to, government, policies, as, in, the, case, of, daiyo, kangoku, system, substitute, prison, and, the, methods, of, interrogating, crime, suspects, the, effort, of, these, agencies, and, ordinary, people, seem, to, pay, off, in, 2016, the, u, s, department, of, state, released, a, report, stating, that, japan, s, human, right, record, is, showing, signs, of, improvement, whilst, australia, does, not, have, an, enshrined, bill, of, rights, or, similar, binding, legal, document, civil, liberties, are, assumed, as, protected, through, a, series, of, rules, and, conventions, australia, had, primary, involvement, in, and, was, a, key, signatory, to, the, un, universal, declaration, on, human, rights, 1948, the, constitution, of, australia, 1900, does, offer, very, limited, protection, of, rights, certain, high, court, interpretations, of, the, constitution, have, allowed, for, implied, rights, such, as, freedom, of, political, communication, which, is, construed, broadly, and, the, right, to, vote, to, be, established, however, others, such, as, freedom, of, assembly, and, freedom, of, association, are, yet, to, be, identified, refugee, issues, within, the, past, decade, australia, has, experienced, increasing, contention, regarding, its, treatment, of, those, seeking, asylum, although, australia, is, a, signatory, to, the, un, refugee, convention, 1951, successive, governments, have, demonstrated, an, increasing, tightening, of, borders, particularly, against, those, who, seek, passage, via, small, water, vessels, the, abbott, government, 2013, like, its, predecessors, the, gillard, and, howard, governments, has, encountered, particular, difficulty, curbing, asylum, seekers, via, sea, increasingly, identified, as, illegal, immigration, the, recent, involvement, of, the, australian, navy, in, refugee, rescue, operations, has, many, human, rights, groups, such, as, amnesty, international, concerned, over, the, militarisation, of, treatment, to, the, refugee, and, the, issue, of, their, human, rights, in, australia, the, current, turn, back, policy, is, particularly, divisive, as, it, involves, placing, refugees, in, government, lifeboats, and, turning, them, towards, indonesia, despite, opposition, however, the, abbott, government, s, response, has, so, far, seen, a, reduction, in, the, number, of, potential, refugees, undertaking, the, hazardous, cross, to, australia, which, is, argued, by, the, government, as, an, indicator, for, its, policy, success, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, to, which, almost, all, european, countries, belong, apart, from, belarus, enumerates, a, number, of, civil, liberties, and, is, of, varying, constitutional, force, in, different, european, states, following, the, velvet, revolution, a, constitutional, overhaul, took, place, in, czechoslovakia, in, 1991, the, charter, of, fundamental, rights, and, basic, freedoms, was, adopted, having, the, same, legal, standing, as, the, constitution, the, czech, republic, has, kept, the, charter, in, its, entirety, following, the, dissolution, of, czechoslovakia, as, act, no, 2, 1993, coll, constitution, being, no, 1, france, s, 1789, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, listed, many, civil, liberties, and, is, of, constitutional, force, the, german, constitution, the, grundgesetz, lit, base, law, starts, with, an, elaborate, listing, of, civil, liberties, and, states, in, sec, 1, the, dignity, of, man, is, inviolable, to, respect, and, protect, it, shall, be, the, duty, of, all, public, authority, following, the, austrian, system, the, people, have, the, right, to, appeal, to, the, federal, constitutional, court, of, germany, bundesverfassungsgericht, if, they, feel, their, civil, rights, are, being, violated, this, procedure, has, shaped, german, law, considerably, over, the, years, civil, liberties, in, the, united, kingdom, date, back, to, magna, carta, in, 1215, and, 17th, century, common, law, and, statute, law, such, as, the, 1628, petition, of, right, the, habeas, corpus, act, 1679, and, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, parts, of, these, laws, remain, in, statute, today, and, are, supplemented, by, other, legislation, and, conventions, that, collectively, form, the, uncodified, constitution, of, the, united, kingdom, in, addition, the, united, kingdom, is, a, signatory, to, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, which, covers, both, human, rights, and, civil, liberties, the, human, rights, act, 1998, incorporates, the, great, majority, of, convention, rights, directly, into, uk, law, in, june, 2008, the, then, shadow, home, secretary, david, davis, resigned, his, parliamentary, seat, over, what, he, described, as, the, erosion, of, civil, liberties, by, the, then, labour, government, and, was, re, elected, on, a, civil, liberties, platform, although, he, was, not, opposed, by, candidates, of, other, major, parties, this, was, in, reference, to, anti, terrorism, laws, and, in, particular, the, extension, to, pre, trial, detention, that, is, perceived, by, many, to, be, an, infringement, of, habeas, corpus, established, in, magna, carta, the, constitution, of, the, russian, federation, guarantees, in, theory, many, of, the, same, rights, and, civil, liberties, as, the, u, s, except, to, bear, arms, i, e, freedom, of, speech, freedom, of, religion, freedom, of, association, and, assembly, freedom, to, choose, language, to, due, process, to, a, fair, trial, privacy, freedom, to, vote, right, for, education, etc, however, human, rights, groups, like, amnesty, international, have, warned, that, vladimir, putin, has, seriously, curtailed, freedom, of, expression, freedom, of, assembly, and, freedom, of, association, amidst, growing, authoritarianism, the, constitution, of, canada, includes, the, canadian, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, which, guarantees, many, of, the, same, rights, as, the, u, s, constitution, the, charter, omits, any, mention, of, or, protection, for, property, the, constitution, of, mexico, was, ratified, on, february, 5, 1917, similar, to, the, u, s, constitution, the, united, mexican, states, provides, all, citizens, the, right, to, freedom, of, expression, but, this, right, is, not, absolute, for, example, child, pornography, death, threats, and, defamation, are, exceptions, to, freedom, of, speech, and, offenders, can, be, subject, to, penalties, however, unlike, the, united, states, and, canada, mexico, has, stricter, limits, on, citizenship, for, example, only, people, born, in, mexico, may, take, roles, in, law, enforcement, legislating, or, enlist, in, the, armed, forces, it, also, states, each, person, born, in, mexico, cannot, be, deprived, of, their, citizenship, status, the, united, states, constitution, especially, its, bill, of, rights, protects, civil, liberties, the, passage, of, the, fourteenth, amendment, further, protected, civil, liberties, by, introducing, the, privileges, or, immunities, clause, due, process, clause, and, equal, protection, clause, human, rights, within, the, united, states, are, often, called, civil, rights, which, are, those, rights, privileges, and, immunities, held, by, all, people, in, distinction, to, political, rights, which, are, the, rights, that, inhere, to, those, who, are, entitled, to, participate, in, elections, as, candidates, or, voters, before, universal, suffrage, this, distinction, was, important, since, many, people, were, ineligible, to, vote, but, still, were, considered, to, have, the, fundamental, freedoms, derived, from, the, rights, to, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, this, distinction, is, less, important, now, that, americans, enjoy, near, universal, suffrage, and, civil, rights, are, now, taken, to, include, the, political, rights, to, vote, and, participate, in, elections, being, furthermore, classified, with, civil, liberties, in, general, as, either, positive, rights, or, negative, rights, because, native, american, tribal, governments, retain, sovereignty, over, tribal, members, the, u, s, congress, in, 1968, enacted, a, law, that, essentially, applies, most, of, the, protections, of, the, bill, of, rights, to, tribal, members, to, be, enforced, mainly, by, tribal, courts, the, civil, liberties, act, of, 1988, was, signed, into, effect, by, president, ronald, reagan, on, august, 10, 1988, the, act, was, passed, by, congress, to, issue, a, public, apology, for, those, of, japanese, ancestry, who, lost, their, property, and, liberty, due, to, discriminatory, actions, by, the, united, states, government, during, the, internment, period, this, act, also, provided, many, other, benefits, within, various, sectors, of, the, government, within, the, treasury, it, established, a, civil, liberties, public, education, fund, it, directed, the, attorney, general, to, identify, and, locate, each, individual, affected, by, this, act, and, to, pay, them, 20, 000, from, the, civil, liberties, public, education, fund, it, also, established, a, board, of, directors, who, is, responsible, for, making, disbursements, from, this, fund, finally, it, required, that, all, documents, and, records, that, are, created, or, received, by, the, commission, be, kept, by, the, archivist, of, the, united, states
