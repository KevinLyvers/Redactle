https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers
the, separation, of, powers, principle, functionally, differentiates, several, types, of, state, power, usually, law, making, adjudication, and, execution, and, requires, these, operations, of, government, to, be, conceptually, and, institutionally, distinguishable, and, articulated, thereby, maintaining, the, integrity, of, each, to, put, this, model, into, practice, government, is, divided, into, structurally, independent, branches, each, particularly, suited, to, its, function, most, often, a, legislature, a, judiciary, and, an, administration, sometimes, known, as, the, trias, politica, when, each, function, is, allocated, strictly, to, one, branch, a, government, is, described, as, having, a, high, degree, of, separation, whereas, when, one, person, or, branch, plays, a, significant, part, in, the, exercise, of, more, than, one, function, this, represents, a, fusion, of, powers, aristotle, first, mentioned, the, idea, of, a, mixed, government, or, hybrid, government, in, his, work, politics, where, he, drew, upon, many, of, the, constitutional, forms, in, the, city, states, of, ancient, greece, in, the, roman, republic, the, roman, senate, consuls, and, the, assemblies, showed, an, example, of, a, mixed, government, according, to, polybius, histories, book, 6, 11, 13, it, was, polybius, who, described, and, explained, the, system, of, checks, and, balances, in, detail, crediting, lycurgus, of, sparta, with, the, first, government, of, this, kind, john, calvin, 1509, 1564, favoured, a, system, of, government, that, divided, political, power, between, democracy, and, aristocracy, mixed, government, calvin, appreciated, the, advantages, of, democracy, stating, it, is, an, invaluable, gift, if, god, allows, a, people, to, elect, its, own, government, and, magistrates, in, order, to, reduce, the, danger, of, misuse, of, political, power, calvin, suggested, setting, up, several, political, institutions, that, should, complement, and, control, each, other, in, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, in, this, way, calvin, and, his, followers, resisted, political, absolutism, and, furthered, the, growth, of, democracy, calvin, aimed, to, protect, the, rights, and, the, well, being, of, ordinary, people, in, 1620, a, group, of, english, separatist, congregationalists, and, anglicans, later, known, as, the, pilgrim, fathers, founded, plymouth, colony, in, north, america, enjoying, self, rule, they, established, a, bipartite, democratic, system, of, government, the, freemen, elected, the, general, court, which, functioned, as, legislature, and, judiciary, and, which, in, turn, elected, a, governor, who, together, with, his, seven, assistants, served, in, the, functional, role, of, providing, executive, power, massachusetts, bay, colony, founded, 1628, rhode, island, 1636, connecticut, 1636, new, jersey, and, pennsylvania, had, similar, constitutions, they, all, separated, political, powers, books, like, william, bradford, s, of, plymouth, plantation, written, between, 1630, and, 1651, were, widely, read, in, england, so, the, form, of, government, in, the, colonies, was, well, known, in, the, mother, country, including, to, the, philosopher, john, locke, 1632, 1704, he, deduced, from, a, study, of, the, english, constitutional, system, the, advantages, of, dividing, political, power, into, the, legislative, which, should, be, distributed, among, several, bodies, for, example, the, house, of, lords, and, the, house, of, commons, on, the, one, hand, and, the, executive, and, federative, power, responsible, for, the, protection, of, the, country, and, prerogative, of, the, monarch, on, the, other, hand, as, the, kingdom, of, england, had, no, written, constitution, during, the, english, civil, war, the, parliamentarians, viewed, the, english, system, of, government, as, composed, of, three, branches, the, king, the, house, of, lords, and, the, house, of, commons, where, the, first, should, have, executive, powers, only, and, the, latter, two, legislative, powers, one, of, the, first, documents, proposing, a, tripartite, system, of, separation, of, powers, was, the, instrument, of, government, written, by, the, english, general, john, lambert, in, 1653, and, soon, adopted, as, the, constitution, of, england, for, few, years, during, the, protectorate, the, system, comprised, a, legislative, branch, the, parliament, and, two, executive, branches, the, english, council, of, state, and, the, lord, protector, all, being, elected, though, the, lord, protector, was, elected, for, life, and, having, checks, upon, each, other, a, further, development, in, english, thought, was, the, idea, that, the, judicial, powers, should, be, separated, from, the, executive, branch, this, followed, the, use, of, the, juridical, system, by, the, crown, to, prosecute, opposition, leaders, following, the, restoration, in, the, late, years, of, charles, ii, and, during, the, short, reign, of, james, ii, namely, during, the, 1680s, the, first, constitutional, document, to, establish, the, principle, of, the, separation, of, powers, in, government, between, the, legislative, executive, and, judiciary, branches, was, pacts, and, constitutions, of, rights, and, freedoms, of, the, zaporizhian, host, written, in, 1710, by, ukrainian, hetman, pylyp, orlyk, an, earlier, forerunner, to, montesquieu, s, tripartite, system, was, articulated, by, john, locke, in, his, work, two, treatises, of, government, 1690, in, the, two, treatises, locke, distinguished, between, legislative, executive, and, federative, power, locke, defined, legislative, power, as, having, the, right, to, direct, how, the, force, of, the, commonwealth, shall, be, employed, 2nd, tr, 143, while, executive, power, entailed, the, execution, of, the, laws, that, are, made, and, remain, in, force, 2nd, tr, 144, locke, further, distinguished, federative, power, which, entailed, the, power, of, war, and, peace, leagues, and, alliances, and, all, transactions, with, all, persons, and, communities, without, the, commonwealth, 2nd, tr, 145, or, what, is, now, known, as, foreign, policy, locke, distinguishes, between, separate, powers, but, not, discretely, separate, institutions, and, notes, that, one, body, or, person, can, share, in, two, or, more, of, the, powers, within, these, factors, locke, heavily, argues, for, autry, for, action, as, the, scope, and, intensity, of, these, campaigns, are, extremely, limited, in, their, ability, to, form, concentrations, of, power, for, instance, locke, noted, that, while, the, executive, and, federative, powers, are, different, they, are, often, combined, in, a, single, institution, 2nd, tr, 148, locke, believed, that, the, legislative, power, was, supreme, over, the, executive, and, federative, powers, which, are, subordinate, locke, reasoned, that, the, legislative, was, supreme, because, it, has, law, giving, authority, or, what, can, give, laws, to, another, must, need, to, be, superior, to, him, 2nd, tr, 150, according, to, locke, legislative, power, derives, its, authority, from, the, people, who, have, the, right, to, make, and, unmake, the, legislature, and, when, the, people, have, said, we, will, submit, to, rules, and, be, governed, by, laws, made, by, such, men, nobody, else, can, say, other, men, shall, make, laws, for, them, nor, can, the, people, be, bound, by, any, laws, but, as, such, as, are, enacted, by, those, whom, they, have, chosen, and, authorized, to, make, laws, for, them, locke, maintains, that, there, are, restrictions, on, the, legislative, power, locke, says, that, the, legislature, cannot, govern, arbitrarily, cannot, levy, taxes, or, confiscate, property, without, the, consent, of, the, governed, cf, no, taxation, without, representation, and, cannot, transfer, its, law, making, powers, to, another, body, known, as, the, nondelegation, doctrine, 2nd, tr, 142, the, term, tripartite, system, is, commonly, ascribed, to, french, enlightenment, political, philosopher, montesquieu, although, he, did, not, use, such, a, term, but, referred, to, the, distribution, of, powers, in, the, spirit, of, law, 1748, montesquieu, described, the, various, forms, of, distribution, of, political, power, among, a, legislature, an, executive, and, a, judiciary, montesquieu, s, approach, was, to, present, and, defend, a, form, of, government, whose, powers, were, not, excessively, centralized, in, a, single, monarch, or, similar, ruler, a, form, known, then, as, aristocracy, he, based, this, model, on, the, constitution, of, the, roman, republic, and, the, british, constitutional, system, montesquieu, took, the, view, that, the, roman, republic, had, powers, separated, so, that, no, one, could, usurp, complete, power, in, the, british, constitutional, system, montesquieu, discerned, a, separation, of, powers, among, the, monarch, parliament, and, the, courts, of, law, in, every, government, there, are, three, sorts, of, power, the, legislative, the, executive, in, respect, to, things, dependent, on, the, law, of, nations, and, the, executive, in, regard, to, matters, that, depend, on, the, civil, law, by, virtue, of, the, first, the, prince, or, magistrate, enacts, temporary, or, perpetual, laws, and, amends, or, abrogates, those, that, have, been, already, enacted, by, the, second, he, makes, peace, or, war, sends, or, receives, embassies, establishes, public, security, and, provides, against, invasions, by, the, third, he, punishes, criminals, or, determines, the, disputes, that, arise, between, individuals, the, latter, we, shall, call, the, judiciary, power, and, the, other, simply, the, executive, power, of, the, state, montesquieu, argues, that, each, power, should, only, exercise, its, own, functions, he, was, quite, explicit, here, when, the, legislative, and, executive, powers, are, united, in, the, same, person, or, in, the, same, body, of, magistrates, there, can, be, no, liberty, because, apprehensions, may, arise, lest, the, same, monarch, or, senate, should, enact, tyrannical, laws, to, execute, them, in, a, tyrannical, manner, again, there, is, no, liberty, if, the, judiciary, power, is, not, separated, from, the, legislative, and, executive, were, it, joined, with, the, legislative, the, life, and, liberty, of, the, subject, would, be, exposed, to, arbitrary, control, for, the, judge, would, be, then, the, legislator, were, it, joined, to, the, executive, power, the, judge, might, behave, with, violence, and, oppression, there, would, be, an, end, to, everything, were, the, same, man, or, the, same, body, whether, of, the, nobles, or, of, the, people, to, exercise, those, three, powers, that, of, enacting, laws, executing, the, public, resolutions, and, trying, the, causes, of, individuals, separation, of, powers, requires, a, different, source, of, legitimization, or, a, different, act, of, legitimization, from, the, same, source, for, each, of, the, separate, powers, if, the, legislative, branch, appoints, the, executive, and, judicial, powers, as, montesquieu, indicated, there, will, be, no, separation, or, division, of, its, powers, since, the, power, to, appoint, carries, with, it, the, power, to, revoke, the, executive, power, ought, to, be, in, the, hands, of, a, monarch, because, this, branch, of, government, having, need, of, despatch, is, better, administered, by, one, than, by, many, on, the, other, hand, whatever, depends, on, the, legislative, power, is, oftentimes, better, regulated, by, many, than, by, a, single, person, but, if, there, were, no, monarch, and, the, executive, power, should, be, committed, to, a, certain, number, of, persons, selected, from, the, legislative, body, there, would, be, an, end, then, of, liberty, by, reason, the, two, powers, would, be, united, as, the, same, persons, would, sometimes, possess, and, would, be, always, able, to, possess, a, share, in, both, montesquieu, actually, specified, that, the, independence, of, the, judiciary, has, to, be, real, and, not, merely, apparent, the, judiciary, was, generally, seen, as, the, most, important, of, the, three, powers, independent, and, unchecked, according, to, the, principle, of, checks, and, balances, each, of, the, branches, of, the, state, should, have, the, power, to, limit, or, check, the, other, two, creating, a, balance, between, the, three, separate, powers, of, the, state, each, branch, s, efforts, to, prevent, either, of, the, other, branches, from, becoming, supreme, form, part, of, an, eternal, conflict, which, leaves, the, people, free, from, government, abuses, immanuel, kant, was, an, advocate, of, this, noting, that, the, problem, of, setting, up, a, state, can, be, solved, even, by, a, nation, of, devils, so, long, as, they, possess, an, appropriate, constitution, to, pit, opposing, factions, against, each, other, checks, and, balances, are, designed, to, maintain, the, system, of, separation, of, powers, keeping, each, branch, in, its, place, the, idea, is, that, it, is, not, enough, to, separate, the, powers, and, guarantee, their, independence, but, the, branches, need, to, have, the, constitutional, means, to, defend, their, own, legitimate, powers, from, the, encroachments, of, the, other, branches, under, this, influence, it, was, implemented, in, 1787, in, the, constitution, of, the, united, states, in, federalist, no, 78, alexander, hamilton, citing, montesquieu, redefined, the, judiciary, as, a, separately, distinct, branch, of, government, with, the, legislative, and, the, executive, branches, before, hamilton, many, colonists, in, the, american, colonies, had, adhered, to, british, political, ideas, and, conceived, of, government, as, divided, into, executive, and, legislative, branches, with, judges, operating, as, appendages, of, the, executive, branch, the, following, example, of, the, separation, of, powers, and, their, mutual, checks, and, balances, from, the, experience, of, the, united, states, constitution, specifically, federalist, no, 51, is, presented, as, illustrative, of, the, general, principles, applied, in, similar, forms, of, government, as, well, but, the, great, security, against, a, gradual, concentration, of, the, several, powers, in, the, same, department, consists, in, giving, to, those, who, administer, each, department, the, necessary, constitutional, means, and, personal, motives, to, resist, encroachments, of, the, others, the, provision, for, defense, must, in, this, as, in, all, other, cases, be, made, commensurate, to, the, danger, of, attack, ambition, must, be, made, to, counteract, ambition, the, interest, of, the, man, must, be, connected, with, the, constitutional, rights, of, the, place, it, may, be, a, reflection, of, human, nature, that, such, devices, should, be, necessary, to, control, the, abuses, of, government, but, what, is, government, itself, but, the, greatest, of, all, reflections, on, human, nature, if, men, were, angels, no, government, would, be, necessary, if, angels, were, to, govern, men, neither, external, nor, internal, controls, on, government, would, be, necessary, in, framing, a, government, that, is, to, be, administered, by, men, over, men, the, great, difficulty, lies, in, this, you, must, first, enable, the, government, to, control, the, governed, and, in, the, next, place, oblige, it, to, control, itself, a, dependence, on, the, people, is, no, doubt, the, primary, control, of, the, government, but, experience, has, taught, mankind, the, necessity, of, auxiliary, precautions, this, policy, of, supplying, by, opposite, and, rival, interests, the, defect, of, better, motives, might, be, traced, through, the, whole, system, of, human, affairs, private, as, well, as, public, we, see, it, particularly, displayed, in, all, the, subordinate, distributions, of, power, where, the, constant, aim, is, to, divide, and, arrange, the, several, offices, in, such, a, manner, as, that, each, may, be, a, check, on, the, other, and, that, the, private, interest, of, every, individual, may, be, a, sentinel, over, the, public, rights, these, inventions, of, prudence, cannot, be, less, requisite, in, the, distribution, of, the, supreme, powers, of, the, state, there, are, different, theories, about, how, to, differentiate, the, functions, of, the, state, or, types, of, government, power, so, that, they, may, be, distributed, among, multiple, structures, of, government, usually, called, branches, of, government, or, arms, there, are, analytical, theories, that, provide, a, conceptual, lens, through, which, to, understand, the, separation, of, powers, as, realized, in, real, world, governments, developed, by, the, academic, discipline, of, comparative, government, there, are, also, normative, theories, both, of, political, philosophy, and, constitutional, law, meant, to, propose, a, reasoned, not, conventional, or, arbitrary, way, to, separate, powers, disagreement, arises, between, various, normative, theories, in, particular, about, what, is, the, desirable, in, the, case, of, political, philosophy, or, prescribed, in, the, case, of, legal, studies, allocation, of, functions, to, specific, governing, bodies, or, branches, of, government, how, to, correctly, or, usefully, delineate, and, define, the, state, functions, is, another, major, bone, of, contention, the, legislative, function, of, the, government, broadly, consists, of, authoritatively, issuing, binding, rules, the, function, of, adjudication, judicial, function, is, the, binding, application, of, legal, rules, to, a, particular, case, which, usually, involves, creatively, interpreting, and, developing, these, rules, the, executive, function, of, government, includes, many, exercises, of, powers, in, fact, whether, in, carrying, into, effect, legal, decisions, or, affecting, the, real, world, on, its, own, initiative, adjudicating, constitutional, disputes, is, sometimes, conceptually, distinguished, from, other, types, of, power, because, applying, the, often, unusually, indeterminate, provisions, of, constitutions, tends, to, call, for, exceptional, methods, to, come, to, reasoned, decisions, administration, is, sometimes, proposed, as, a, hybrid, function, combining, aspects, of, the, three, other, functions, opponents, of, this, view, conceive, of, the, actions, of, administrative, agencies, as, consisting, of, the, three, established, functions, being, exercised, next, to, each, other, merely, in, fact, supervision, and, integrity, assuring, activities, e, g, supervision, of, elections, as, well, as, mediating, functions, pouvoir, neutre, are, also, in, some, instances, regarded, as, their, own, type, rather, than, a, subset, or, combination, of, other, types
