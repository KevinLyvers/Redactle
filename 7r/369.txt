the, kra, dai, languages, k, r, d, a, krah, dy, also, known, as, tai, kadai, t, a, k, d, a, tie, k, dye, and, daic, d, a, k, dye, ik, are, a, language, family, in, mainland, southeast, asia, southern, china, and, northeastern, india, all, languages, in, the, family, are, tonal, including, thai, and, lao, the, national, languages, of, thailand, and, laos, respectively, around, 93, million, people, speak, kra, dai, languages, 60, of, those, speak, thai, ethnologue, lists, 95, languages, in, the, family, with, 62, of, these, being, in, the, tai, branch, the, name, kra, dai, was, proposed, by, weera, ostapirat, 2000, as, kra, and, dai, are, the, reconstructed, autonyms, of, the, kra, and, tai, branches, respectively, kra, dai, has, since, been, used, by, the, majority, of, specialists, working, on, southeast, asian, linguistics, including, norquest, 2007, pittayaporn, 2009, baxter, sagart, 2014, and, enfield, comrie, 2015, the, name, tai, kadai, is, used, in, many, references, as, well, as, ethnologue, and, glottolog, but, ostapirat, 2000, and, others, suggest, that, it, is, problematic, and, confusing, preferring, the, name, kra, dai, instead, tai, kadai, comes, from, an, obsolete, bifurcation, of, the, family, into, two, branches, tai, and, kadai, which, had, first, been, proposed, by, paul, k, benedict, 1942, in, 1942, benedict, placed, three, kra, languages, gelao, laqua, qabiao, and, lachi, together, with, hlai, in, a, group, that, he, called, kadai, from, ka, meaning, person, in, gelao, and, laqua, and, dai, a, form, of, a, hlai, autonym, benedict, s, 1942, kadai, group, was, based, on, his, observation, that, kra, and, hlai, languages, have, austronesian, like, numerals, however, this, classification, is, now, universally, rejected, as, obsolete, after, ostapirat, 2000, demonstrated, the, coherence, of, the, kra, branch, which, does, not, subgroup, with, the, hlai, branch, as, benedict, 1942, had, proposed, kadai, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, entire, kra, dai, family, including, by, solnit, 1988, adding, to, the, confusion, some, other, references, restrict, the, usage, of, kadai, to, only, the, kra, branch, of, the, family, the, name, daic, is, used, by, roger, blench, 2008, james, r, chamberlain, 2016, proposes, that, the, tai, kadai, kra, dai, language, family, was, formed, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, bce, in, the, middle, of, the, yangtze, basin, coinciding, roughly, with, the, establishment, of, the, chu, fiefdom, and, the, beginning, of, the, zhou, dynasty, the, high, diversity, of, kra, dai, languages, in, southern, china, especially, in, guizhou, and, hainan, points, to, that, being, an, origin, of, the, kra, dai, language, family, founding, the, nations, that, later, became, thailand, and, laos, in, what, had, been, austroasiatic, territory, genetic, and, linguistic, analyses, show, great, homogeneity, among, kra, dai, speaking, people, in, thailand, although, the, position, of, kra, dai, in, relation, to, austronesian, is, still, contested, some, propose, that, kra, dai, and, austronesian, are, genetically, connected, weera, ostapirat, 2005, sets, out, a, series, of, regular, sound, correspondences, between, them, assuming, a, model, of, a, primary, split, between, the, two, they, would, then, be, co, ordinate, branches, ostapirat, 2013, continues, to, maintain, that, kra, dai, and, austronesian, are, sister, language, families, based, on, certain, phonological, correspondences, on, the, other, hand, laurent, sagart, 2008, proposes, that, kra, dai, is, a, later, form, of, what, he, calls, fatk, formosan, ancestor, of, tai, kadai, a, branch, of, austronesian, belonging, to, the, subgroup, puluqic, developed, in, taiwan, whose, speakers, migrated, back, to, the, mainland, to, guangdong, hainan, and, north, vietnam, around, the, second, half, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, upon, their, arrival, in, this, region, they, underwent, linguistic, contact, with, an, unknown, population, resulting, in, a, partial, relexification, of, fatk, vocabulary, erica, brindley, 2015, supports, sagart, s, hypothesis, arguing, that, the, radically, different, kra, dai, history, of, migration, to, the, mainland, as, opposed, to, the, philippines, for, proto, austronesian, and, extended, contact, with, austro, asiatic, and, sinitic, speakers, would, make, the, relationship, appear, more, distant, she, also, suggests, that, the, presence, of, only, the, most, basic, austronesian, vocabulary, in, kra, dai, makes, this, scenario, of, relexification, more, plausible, besides, various, concrete, pieces, of, evidence, for, a, kra, dai, existence, in, present, day, guangdong, remnants, of, kra, dai, languages, spoken, further, north, can, be, found, in, unearthed, inscriptional, materials, and, non, han, substrata, in, min, and, wu, chinese, wolfgang, behr, 2002, 2006, 2009, 2017, points, out, that, most, non, sinitic, words, found, in, chu, inscriptional, materials, are, of, kra, dai, origin, for, example, the, chu, graph, for, one, once, written, as, oc, nn, in, the, e, jun, qijie, bronze, tally, and, in, warring, states, bamboo, inscriptions, which, represents, a, kra, dai, areal, word, compare, proto, tai, hn, hn, siamese, 22, n, dai, 33, n, longzhou, n, a, etc, one, once, in, the, early, 1980s, wei, qingwen, a, zhuang, linguist, proposed, that, the, old, yue, language, recorded, in, the, song, of, the, yue, boatman, is, in, fact, a, language, ancestral, to, zhuang, wei, used, reconstructed, old, chinese, for, the, characters, and, discovered, that, the, resulting, vocabulary, showed, strong, resemblance, to, modern, zhuang, later, zhengzhang, shangfang, 1991, followed, wei, s, proposal, but, used, thai, script, for, comparison, since, this, orthography, dates, from, the, 13th, century, and, preserves, archaisms, not, found, in, modern, pronunciation, zhengzhang, notes, that, evening, night, dark, bears, the, c, tone, in, wuming, zhuang, xam, c2, and, am, c2, night, the, item, raa, normally, means, we, inclusive, but, in, some, places, e, g, tai, lue, and, white, tai, it, means, i, however, laurent, sagart, criticizes, zhengzhang, s, interpretation, as, anachronistic, because, however, archaic, the, thai, script, is, the, thai, language, was, only, written, 2, 000, years, after, the, song, had, been, recorded, even, if, proto, kam, tai, had, emerged, by, the, 6th, century, bce, its, pronunciation, would, have, been, substantially, different, from, thai, kra, dai, consists, of, at, least, five, well, established, branches, namely, kra, kam, sui, tai, be, and, hlai, ostapirat, 2005, 109, chinese, linguists, have, also, proposed, a, kam, tai, group, that, includes, kam, sui, tai, and, be, kra, dai, languages, that, are, not, securely, classified, and, may, constitute, independent, kra, dai, branches, include, the, following, kra, dai, languages, of, mixed, origins, are, an, early, but, influential, classification, with, the, traditional, kam, tai, clade, was, edmondson, and, solnit, s, classification, from, 1988, this, classification, is, also, used, by, liang, and, zhang, 1996, chamberlain, 2016, 38, and, ethnologue, though, by, 2009, lakkia, was, made, a, third, branch, of, kam, tai, and, biao, was, moved, into, kam, sui, weera, ostapirat, 2005, 128, suggests, the, possibility, of, kra, and, kam, sui, being, grouped, together, as, northern, kra, dai, and, hlai, with, tai, as, southern, kra, dai, norquest, 2007, has, further, updated, this, classification, to, include, lakkia, and, be, norquest, notes, that, lakkia, shares, some, similarities, with, kam, sui, while, be, shares, some, similarities, with, tai, norquest, 2007, 15, notes, that, be, shares, various, similarities, with, northern, tai, languages, in, particular, following, ostapirat, norquest, adopts, the, name, kra, dai, for, the, family, as, a, whole, the, following, tree, of, kra, dai, is, from, norquest, 2007, 16, additionally, norquest, 2007, also, proposes, a, reconstruction, for, proto, southern, kra, dai, a, classification, of, kra, dai, by, norquest, 2015, 2020, is, provided, as, follows, based, on, shared, lexical, innovations, norquest, 2021, significantly, revised, his, classification, of, kra, dai, together, biao, and, lakkja, form, the, most, divergent, subgroup, of, kra, dai, be, tai, and, hlai, are, placed, together, as, part, of, a, hlai, tai, group, several, scholars, have, presented, evidence, that, kra, dai, may, be, related, to, or, even, a, branch, of, the, austronesian, language, family, there, are, a, number, of, possible, cognates, in, the, core, vocabulary, displaying, regular, sound, correspondences, among, proponents, there, is, yet, no, agreement, as, to, whether, they, are, a, sister, group, to, austronesian, in, a, family, called, austro, tai, a, back, migration, from, taiwan, to, the, mainland, or, a, later, migration, from, the, philippines, to, hainan, during, the, austronesian, expansion, the, inclusion, of, japanese, in, the, austro, tai, family, as, proposed, by, paul, k, benedict, in, the, late, 20th, century, is, not, supported, by, the, current, proponents, of, the, austro, tai, hypothesis, the, kra, dai, languages, were, formerly, considered, to, be, part, of, the, sino, tibetan, family, partly, because, they, contain, large, numbers, of, words, that, are, similar, to, sino, tibetan, languages, however, western, scholars, generally, consider, them, to, be, sinitic, loanwords, and, note, that, basic, vocabulary, words, in, kra, dai, languages, often, have, cognates, with, austronesian, instead, outside, china, the, kra, dai, languages, are, now, classified, as, an, independent, family, in, china, they, are, called, dong, tai, or, zhuang, dong, languages, and, are, generally, included, along, with, the, hmong, mien, languages, in, the, sino, tibetan, family, kosaka, 2002, has, argued, specifically, for, a, miao, dai, family, based, on, proposed, lexical, cognates, he, proposes, a, genetic, relation, between, hmong, mien, and, kra, dai, languages, he, further, suggests, that, similarities, between, kra, dai, and, austronesian, are, due, to, later, areal, contact, in, the, coastal, areas, of, eastern, and, southeastern, china, or, an, older, ancestral, relation, proto, east, asian, vovin, 2014, has, proposed, that, the, location, of, the, japonic, urheimat, linguistic, homeland, is, in, southern, china, he, argues, for, typological, evidence, that, proto, japanese, may, have, been, a, monosyllabic, svo, syntax, and, isolating, language, which, is, also, characteristic, of, kra, dai, languages, according, to, him, these, common, features, are, however, not, due, to, a, genetic, relationship, but, rather, the, result, of, intense, contact
