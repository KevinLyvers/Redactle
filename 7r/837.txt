https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group
the, term, minority, group, has, different, usages, depending, on, the, context, according, to, its, common, usage, the, term, minority, group, can, simply, be, understood, in, terms, of, demographic, sizes, within, a, population, i, e, a, group, in, society, with, the, least, number, of, individuals, or, less, than, half, is, a, minority, usually, a, minority, group, is, disempowered, relative, to, the, majority, and, that, characteristic, lends, itself, to, different, applications, of, the, term, minority, in, terms, of, sociology, economics, and, politics, a, demographic, that, takes, up, the, smallest, fraction, of, the, population, is, not, necessarily, labelled, the, minority, if, it, wields, dominant, power, in, the, academic, context, the, terms, minority, and, majority, are, used, in, terms, of, hierarchical, power, structures, for, example, in, south, africa, during, apartheid, white, europeans, held, virtually, all, social, economic, and, political, power, over, black, africans, for, this, reason, black, africans, are, the, minority, group, despite, the, fact, that, they, outnumber, white, europeans, in, south, africa, this, is, why, academics, more, frequently, use, the, term, minority, group, to, refer, to, a, category, of, people, that, experience, relative, disadvantage, as, compared, to, members, of, a, dominant, social, group, to, address, this, ambiguity, harris, mylonas, has, proposed, the, term, non, core, group, instead, of, minority, group, to, refer, to, any, aggregation, of, individuals, that, is, perceived, as, an, unassimilated, ethnic, group, on, a, linguistic, religious, physical, or, ideological, basis, by, the, ruling, political, elite, of, a, country, and, reserves, the, term, minority, only, for, groups, that, have, been, granted, minority, rights, by, their, state, of, residence, minority, group, membership, is, typically, based, on, differences, in, observable, characteristics, or, practices, such, as, ethnicity, ethnic, minority, race, racial, minority, religion, religious, minority, sexual, orientation, sexual, minority, or, disability, the, framework, of, intersectionality, can, be, used, to, recognize, that, an, individual, may, simultaneously, hold, membership, in, multiple, minority, groups, e, g, both, a, racial, and, religious, minority, likewise, individuals, may, also, be, part, of, a, minority, group, in, regard, to, some, characteristics, but, part, of, a, dominant, group, in, regard, to, others, the, term, minority, group, often, occurs, within, the, discourse, of, civil, rights, and, collective, rights, as, members, of, minority, groups, are, prone, to, differential, treatment, in, the, countries, and, societies, in, which, they, live, minority, group, members, often, face, discrimination, in, multiple, areas, of, social, life, including, housing, employment, healthcare, and, education, among, others, while, discrimination, may, be, committed, by, individuals, it, may, also, occur, through, structural, inequalities, in, which, rights, and, opportunities, are, not, equally, accessible, to, all, those, in, favour, of, minority, rights, often, pursue, laws, designed, to, protect, minority, groups, from, discrimination, and, afford, members, of, the, minority, group, equal, social, status, and, legal, protections, as, held, by, members, of, the, dominant, group, prior, to, the, paris, peace, conference, 1919, 1920, the, term, minority, primarily, referred, to, political, parties, in, national, legislatures, not, ethnic, national, linguistic, or, religious, groups, such, minority, parties, were, powerless, relative, to, the, majority, or, plurality, political, group, the, paris, conference, has, been, attributed, with, coining, the, concept, of, minority, rights, and, bringing, prominence, to, it, the, league, of, nations, minorities, commission, defined, minority, in, 1919, as, nationals, belonging, to, racial, religious, or, linguistic, minorities, protection, of, minority, groups, such, as, through, careful, drawing, of, boundaries, of, states, and, proportional, representation, was, seen, as, integral, in, preventing, causes, of, future, wars, louis, wirth, defined, a, minority, group, as, a, group, of, people, who, because, of, their, physical, or, cultural, characteristics, are, singled, out, from, the, others, in, the, society, in, which, they, live, for, differential, and, unequal, treatment, and, who, therefore, regard, themselves, as, objects, of, collective, discrimination, the, definition, includes, both, objective, and, subjective, criteria, membership, of, a, minority, group, is, objectively, ascribed, by, society, based, on, an, individual, s, physical, or, behavioral, characteristics, it, is, also, subjectively, applied, by, its, members, who, may, use, their, status, as, the, basis, of, group, identity, or, solidarity, thus, minority, group, status, is, categorical, an, individual, who, exhibits, the, physical, or, behavioral, characteristics, of, a, given, minority, group, is, accorded, the, status, of, that, group, and, is, subject, to, the, same, treatment, as, other, members, of, that, group, joe, feagin, states, that, a, minority, group, has, five, characteristics, 1, suffering, discrimination, and, subordination, 2, physical, and, or, cultural, traits, that, set, them, apart, and, which, are, disapproved, by, the, dominant, group, 3, a, shared, sense, of, collective, identity, and, common, burdens, 4, socially, shared, rules, about, who, belongs, and, who, does, not, determine, minority, status, and, 5, tendency, to, marry, within, the, group, there, is, a, controversy, with, the, use, of, the, word, minority, as, it, has, a, generic, and, an, academic, usage, common, usage, of, the, term, indicates, a, statistical, minority, however, academics, refer, to, power, differences, among, groups, rather, than, differences, in, population, size, among, groups, the, above, criticism, is, based, on, the, idea, that, a, group, can, be, considered, a, minority, even, if, it, includes, such, a, large, number, of, people, that, it, is, numerically, not, a, minority, in, society, some, sociologists, have, criticized, the, concept, of, minority, majority, arguing, this, language, excludes, or, neglects, changing, or, unstable, cultural, identities, as, well, as, cultural, affiliations, across, national, boundaries, as, such, the, term, historically, excluded, groups, hegs, is, often, similarly, used, to, highlight, the, role, of, historical, oppression, and, domination, and, how, this, results, in, the, under, representation, of, particular, groups, in, various, areas, of, social, life, the, term, national, minority, is, often, used, to, discuss, minority, groups, in, international, and, national, politics, all, countries, contain, some, degree, of, racial, ethnic, or, linguistic, diversity, in, addition, minorities, may, also, be, immigrant, indigenous, or, landless, nomadic, communities, this, often, results, in, variations, in, language, culture, beliefs, practices, that, set, some, groups, apart, from, the, dominant, group, as, these, differences, are, usually, perceived, negatively, this, results, in, loss, of, social, and, political, power, for, members, of, minority, groups, there, is, no, legal, definition, of, national, minorities, in, international, law, though, protection, of, minority, groups, is, outlined, by, the, united, nations, declaration, on, the, rights, of, persons, belonging, to, national, or, ethnic, religious, and, linguistic, minorities, international, criminal, law, can, protect, the, rights, of, racial, or, ethnic, minorities, in, several, ways, the, right, to, self, determination, is, a, key, issue, the, council, of, europe, regulates, minority, rights, in, the, european, charter, for, regional, or, minority, languages, and, the, framework, convention, for, the, protection, of, national, minorities, in, some, places, subordinate, ethnic, groups, may, constitute, a, numerical, majority, such, as, blacks, in, south, africa, under, apartheid, in, the, united, states, for, example, non, hispanic, whites, constitute, the, majority, 63, 4, and, all, other, racial, and, ethnic, groups, mexican, african, americans, asian, americans, american, indian, and, native, hawaiians, are, classified, as, minorities, if, the, non, hispanic, white, population, falls, below, 50, the, group, will, only, be, the, plurality, not, the, majority, racial, minorities, sometimes, referred, to, synonymously, as, people, of, color, or, non, white, people, are, minority, groups, that, are, discriminated, against, on, the, basis, of, race, though, definitions, vary, cross, culturally, modern, racism, is, primarily, based, on, the, european, and, american, classifications, of, race, that, developed, during, the, age, of, exploration, as, european, countries, sought, to, categorize, the, nations, they, colonized, into, pseudo, scientific, phenotypical, groups, in, the, united, states, s, system, whiteness, is, at, the, top, of, a, hierarchy, that, automatically, classifies, mixed, race, individuals, as, their, subordinate, race, sometimes, racist, policies, explicitly, codified, pseudo, scientific, definitions, of, race, such, as, the, united, states, one, drop, rule, and, blood, quantum, laws, south, africa, s, apartheid, and, nazi, germany, nuremberg, race, laws, other, times, race, has, been, a, matter, of, self, identification, with, de, facto, racist, policies, implemented, in, addition, to, governmental, policy, racism, may, persist, as, social, prejudice, and, discrimination, there, are, also, social, groups, that, are, usually, identified, through, ethnicity, like, race, ethnicity, is, largely, determined, hereditarily, however, it, can, also, be, influenced, by, factors, such, as, adoption, cultural, assimilation, religious, conversion, and, language, shift, as, race, and, ethnicity, often, overlap, many, ethnic, minorities, are, also, racial, minorities, however, this, is, not, always, the, case, and, some, people, are, ethnic, minorities, while, also, being, classified, as, white, such, as, some, jews, roma, and, s, mi, in, some, cases, their, ethnic, identities, have, been, seen, as, negating, their, whiteness, in, both, inter, and, intra, group, identification, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, there, is, a, preference, to, categorise, people, by, ethnicity, instead, of, race, ethnicity, encompasses, a, mix, of, long, shared, cultural, experiences, religious, practices, traditions, ancestry, language, dialect, or, national, origins, the, united, kingdom, considers, everyone, but, white, british, people, to, be, an, ethnic, minority, including, other, white, europeans, such, as, white, irish, people, excluding, in, northern, ireland, a, national, minority, is, a, social, group, within, a, state, that, differs, from, the, majority, and, or, dominant, population, in, terms, of, ethnicity, language, culture, or, religion, but, also, it, also, tends, to, have, a, close, link, with, a, specific, territory, from, which, the, minority, social, group, originates, also, known, as, castelike, minorities, involuntary, minorities, are, a, term, for, people, who, were, originally, brought, into, any, society, against, their, will, in, the, united, states, for, instance, it, includes, but, is, not, limited, to, native, americans, native, hawaiians, puerto, ricans, african, americans, and, in, the, 1800s, native, born, hispanics, immigrants, take, on, minority, status, in, their, new, country, usually, in, hopes, of, a, better, future, economically, educationally, and, politically, than, in, their, homeland, because, of, their, focus, on, success, voluntary, minorities, are, more, likely, to, do, better, in, school, than, other, migrating, minorities, adapting, to, a, very, different, culture, and, language, makes, difficulties, in, the, early, stages, of, life, in, the, new, country, voluntary, immigrants, do, not, experience, a, sense, of, divided, identity, as, much, as, involuntary, minorities, and, are, often, rich, in, social, capital, because, of, their, educational, ambitions, major, immigrant, groups, in, the, united, states, include, mexicans, central, and, south, americans, cubans, africans, east, asians, and, south, asians, the, term, sexual, minority, is, frequently, used, by, public, health, researchers, to, recognize, a, wide, variety, of, individuals, who, engage, in, same, sex, sexual, behavior, including, those, who, do, not, identify, under, the, lgbtq, umbrella, for, example, men, who, have, sex, with, men, msm, but, do, not, identify, as, gay, in, addition, the, term, gender, minorities, can, include, many, types, of, gender, variant, people, such, as, intersex, people, transgender, people, or, non, binary, individuals, however, the, terms, sexual, and, gender, minority, are, often, not, preferred, by, lgbtq, people, as, they, represent, clinical, categories, rather, than, individual, identity, though, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and, queer, lgbtq, people, have, existed, throughout, human, history, they, represent, a, numerical, and, social, minority, they, experience, numerous, social, inequalities, stemming, from, their, group, membership, as, lgbtq, people, lgbtq, rights, movements, across, many, western, countries, led, to, the, recognition, of, lgbtq, people, as, members, of, a, minority, group, these, inequalities, include, social, discrimination, and, isolation, unequal, access, to, healthcare, employment, and, housing, and, experience, negative, mental, and, physical, health, outcomes, due, to, these, experiences, leading, up, to, the, human, rights, act, 1998, in, the, uk, a, rise, in, the, awareness, relating, to, how, disabled, people, were, being, treated, began, many, started, to, believe, that, they, were, being, denied, basic, human, rights, this, act, had, a, section, that, stated, if, authorities, did, not, protect, people, with, learning, disabilities, from, others, actions, such, as, harm, or, neglect, then, they, could, be, prosecuted, the, disability, rights, movement, has, contributed, to, an, understanding, of, disabled, people, as, a, minority, or, a, coalition, of, minorities, who, are, disadvantaged, by, society, not, just, as, people, who, are, disadvantaged, by, their, impairments, advocates, of, disability, rights, emphasize, the, difference, in, physical, or, psychological, functioning, rather, than, inferiority, for, example, some, autistic, people, argue, for, acceptance, of, neurodiversity, much, as, opponents, of, racism, argue, for, acceptance, of, ethnic, diversity, the, deaf, community, is, often, regarded, as, a, linguistic, and, cultural, minority, rather, than, a, group, with, disabilities, and, some, deaf, people, do, not, see, themselves, as, having, a, disability, at, all, rather, they, are, disadvantaged, by, technologies, and, social, institutions, designed, to, cater, to, the, dominant, group, see, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, people, belonging, to, religious, minorities, have, a, faith, that, is, different, from, that, held, by, the, majority, most, countries, of, the, world, have, religious, minorities, it, is, now, widely, accepted, in, the, west, that, people, should, have, the, freedom, to, choose, their, religion, including, the, right, to, convert, from, one, religion, to, another, or, not, to, have, any, religion, atheism, and, or, agnosticism, however, in, many, countries, this, freedom, is, constricted, in, egypt, a, new, system, of, identity, cards, requires, all, citizens, to, state, their, religion, and, the, only, choices, are, islam, christianity, or, judaism, see, egyptian, identification, card, controversy, in, most, societies, numbers, of, men, and, women, are, roughly, equal, though, women, are, not, considered, to, be, a, minority, the, status, of, women, as, a, subordinate, group, has, led, to, many, social, scientists, to, refer, to, them, as, a, disadvantaged, group, though, women, s, legal, rights, and, status, vary, widely, across, countries, women, often, experience, social, inequalities, relative, to, men, in, various, societies, women, are, sometimes, denied, access, to, education, and, access, to, the, same, opportunities, as, men, especially, in, under, developed, countries, in, the, politics, of, some, countries, a, minority, is, an, ethnic, group, recognized, by, law, and, having, specified, rights, speakers, of, a, legally, recognized, minority, language, for, instance, might, have, the, right, to, education, or, communication, with, the, government, in, their, mother, tongue, countries, with, special, provisions, for, minorities, include, canada, china, ethiopia, germany, india, the, netherlands, poland, romania, russia, croatia, and, the, united, kingdom, the, various, minority, groups, in, a, country, are, often, not, given, equal, treatment, some, groups, are, too, small, or, indistinct, to, obtain, minority, protections, for, example, a, member, of, a, particularly, small, ethnic, group, might, be, forced, to, check, other, on, a, checklist, of, different, backgrounds, and, so, might, receive, fewer, privileges, than, a, member, of, a, more, defined, group, many, contemporary, governments, prefer, to, assume, the, people, they, rule, all, belong, to, the, same, nationality, rather, than, separate, ones, based, on, ethnicity, the, united, states, asks, for, race, and, ethnicity, on, its, official, census, forms, which, thus, breaks, up, and, organizes, its, population, into, sub, groups, primarily, racial, rather, than, national, spain, does, not, divide, its, nationals, by, ethnic, group, or, national, minorities, although, it, does, maintain, an, official, notion, of, minority, languages, that, is, one, of, the, criteria, for, to, determine, a, national, minority, upon, the, framework, convention, for, the, protection, of, national, minorities, some, especially, significant, or, powerful, minorities, receive, comprehensive, protection, and, political, representation, for, example, the, former, yugoslav, republic, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, recognizes, the, three, constitutive, nations, none, of, which, constitutes, a, numerical, majority, see, nations, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, however, other, minorities, such, as, roma, and, jews, are, officially, labelled, foreign, and, are, excluded, from, many, of, these, protections, for, example, they, may, be, excluded, from, political, positions, including, the, presidency, there, is, debate, over, recognizing, minority, groups, and, their, privileges, one, view, is, that, the, application, of, special, rights, to, minority, groups, may, harm, some, countries, such, as, new, states, in, africa, or, latin, america, not, founded, on, the, european, nation, state, model, since, minority, recognition, may, interfere, with, establishing, a, national, identity, it, may, hamper, the, integration, of, the, minority, into, mainstream, society, perhaps, leading, to, separatism, or, supremacism, in, canada, some, feel, that, the, failure, of, the, dominant, english, speaking, majority, to, integrate, french, canadians, has, provoked, quebec, separatism, others, assert, that, minorities, require, specific, protections, to, ensure, that, they, are, not, marginalized, for, example, bilingual, education, may, be, needed, to, allow, linguistic, minorities, to, fully, integrate, into, the, school, system, and, compete, equally, in, society, in, this, view, rights, for, minorities, strengthen, the, nation, building, project, as, members, of, minorities, see, their, interests, well, served, and, willingly, accept, the, legitimacy, of, the, nation, and, their, integration, not, assimilation, within, it
