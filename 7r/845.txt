clergy, are, formal, leaders, within, established, religions, their, roles, and, functions, vary, in, different, religious, traditions, but, usually, involve, presiding, over, specific, rituals, and, teaching, their, religion, s, doctrines, and, practices, some, of, the, terms, used, for, individual, clergy, are, clergyman, clergywoman, clergyperson, churchman, cleric, ecclesiastic, and, vicegerent, while, clerk, in, holy, orders, has, a, long, history, but, is, rarely, used, in, christianity, the, specific, names, and, roles, of, the, clergy, vary, by, denomination, and, there, is, a, wide, range, of, formal, and, informal, clergy, positions, including, deacons, elders, priests, bishops, preachers, pastors, presbyters, ministers, and, the, pope, in, islam, a, religious, leader, is, often, known, formally, or, informally, as, an, imam, caliph, qadi, mufti, mullah, muezzin, and, ulema, in, the, jewish, tradition, a, religious, leader, is, often, a, rabbi, teacher, or, hazzan, cantor, the, word, cleric, comes, from, the, ecclesiastical, latin, clericus, for, those, belonging, to, the, priestly, class, in, turn, the, source, of, the, latin, word, is, from, the, ecclesiastical, greek, klerikos, meaning, appertaining, to, an, inheritance, in, reference, to, the, fact, that, the, levitical, priests, of, the, old, testament, had, no, inheritance, except, the, lord, clergy, is, from, two, old, french, words, clergi, and, clergie, which, refer, to, those, with, learning, and, derive, from, medieval, latin, clericatus, from, late, latin, clericus, the, same, word, from, which, cleric, is, derived, clerk, which, used, to, mean, one, ordained, to, the, ministry, also, derives, from, clericus, in, the, middle, ages, reading, and, writing, were, almost, exclusively, the, domain, of, the, priestly, class, and, this, is, the, reason, for, the, close, relationship, of, these, words, within, christianity, especially, in, eastern, christianity, and, formerly, in, western, roman, catholicism, the, term, cleric, refers, to, any, individual, who, has, been, ordained, including, deacons, priests, and, bishops, in, latin, catholicism, the, tonsure, was, a, prerequisite, for, receiving, any, of, the, minor, orders, or, major, orders, before, the, tonsure, minor, orders, and, the, subdiaconate, were, abolished, following, the, second, vatican, council, now, the, clerical, state, is, tied, to, reception, of, the, diaconate, minor, orders, are, still, given, in, the, eastern, catholic, churches, and, those, who, receive, those, orders, are, minor, clerics, the, use, of, the, word, cleric, is, also, appropriate, for, eastern, orthodox, minor, clergy, who, are, tonsured, in, order, not, to, trivialize, orders, such, as, those, of, reader, in, the, eastern, church, or, for, those, who, are, tonsured, yet, have, no, minor, or, major, orders, it, is, in, this, sense, that, the, word, entered, the, arabic, language, most, commonly, in, lebanon, from, the, french, as, kleriki, or, alternatively, cleriki, meaning, seminarian, this, is, all, in, keeping, with, eastern, orthodox, concepts, of, clergy, which, still, include, those, who, have, not, yet, received, or, do, not, plan, to, receive, the, diaconate, a, priesthood, is, a, body, of, priests, shamans, or, oracles, who, have, special, religious, authority, or, function, the, term, priest, is, derived, from, the, greek, presbyter, presb, teros, elder, or, senior, but, is, often, used, in, the, sense, of, sacerdos, in, particular, i, e, for, clergy, performing, ritual, within, the, sphere, of, the, sacred, or, numinous, communicating, with, the, gods, on, behalf, of, the, community, buddhist, clergy, are, often, collectively, referred, to, as, the, sangha, and, consist, of, various, orders, of, male, and, female, monks, originally, called, bhikshus, and, bhikshunis, respectively, this, diversity, of, monastic, orders, and, styles, was, originally, one, community, founded, by, gautama, buddha, during, the, 5th, century, bc, living, under, a, common, set, of, rules, called, the, vinaya, according, to, scriptural, records, these, celibate, monks, and, nuns, in, the, time, of, the, buddha, lived, an, austere, life, of, meditation, living, as, wandering, beggars, for, nine, months, out, of, the, year, and, remaining, in, retreat, during, the, rainy, season, although, such, a, unified, condition, of, pre, sectarian, buddhism, is, questioned, by, some, scholars, however, as, buddhism, spread, geographically, over, time, encountering, different, cultures, responding, to, new, social, political, and, physical, environments, this, single, form, of, buddhist, monasticism, diversified, the, interaction, between, buddhism, and, tibetan, bon, led, to, a, uniquely, tibetan, buddhism, within, which, various, sects, based, upon, certain, teacher, student, lineages, arose, similarly, the, interaction, between, indian, buddhist, monks, particularly, of, the, southern, madhyamika, school, and, chinese, confucian, and, taoist, monks, from, c200, c900ad, produced, the, distinctive, ch, an, buddhism, ch, an, like, the, tibetan, style, further, diversified, into, various, sects, based, upon, the, transmission, style, of, certain, teachers, one, of, the, most, well, known, being, the, rapid, enlightenment, style, of, linji, yixuan, as, well, as, in, response, to, particular, political, developments, such, as, the, an, lushan, rebellion, and, the, buddhist, persecutions, of, emperor, wuzong, in, these, ways, manual, labour, was, introduced, to, a, practice, where, monks, originally, survived, on, alms, layers, of, garments, were, added, where, originally, a, single, thin, robe, sufficed, etc, this, adaptation, of, form, and, roles, of, buddhist, monastic, practice, continued, after, the, transmission, to, japan, for, example, monks, took, on, administrative, functions, for, the, emperor, in, particular, secular, communities, registering, births, marriages, deaths, thereby, creating, buddhist, priests, again, in, response, to, various, historic, attempts, to, suppress, buddhism, most, recently, during, the, meiji, era, the, practice, of, celibacy, was, relaxed, and, japanese, monks, allowed, to, marry, this, form, was, then, transmitted, to, korea, during, later, japanese, occupation, where, celibate, and, non, celibate, monks, today, exist, in, the, same, sects, similar, patterns, can, also, be, observed, in, tibet, during, various, historic, periods, multiple, forms, of, monasticism, have, co, existed, such, as, ngagpa, lamas, and, times, at, which, celibacy, was, relaxed, as, these, varied, styles, of, buddhist, monasticism, are, transmitted, to, western, cultures, still, more, new, forms, are, being, created, in, general, the, mahayana, schools, of, buddhism, tend, to, be, more, culturally, adaptive, and, innovative, with, forms, while, theravada, schools, the, form, generally, practiced, in, thailand, burma, cambodia, and, sri, lanka, tend, to, take, a, much, more, conservative, view, of, monastic, life, and, continue, to, observe, precepts, that, forbid, monks, from, touching, women, or, working, in, certain, secular, roles, this, broad, difference, in, approach, led, to, a, major, schism, among, buddhist, monastics, in, about, the, 4th, century, bce, creating, the, early, buddhist, schools, while, female, monastic, bhikkhuni, lineages, existed, in, most, buddhist, countries, at, one, time, the, theravada, lineages, of, southeast, asia, died, out, during, the, 14th, 15th, century, ad, as, there, is, some, debate, about, whether, the, bhikkhuni, lineage, in, the, more, expansive, vinaya, forms, was, transmitted, to, tibet, the, status, and, future, of, female, buddhist, clergy, in, this, tradition, is, sometimes, disputed, by, strict, adherents, to, the, theravadan, style, some, mahayana, sects, notably, in, the, united, states, such, as, san, francisco, zen, center, are, working, to, reconstruct, the, female, branches, of, what, they, consider, a, common, interwoven, lineage, the, diversity, of, buddhist, traditions, makes, it, difficult, to, generalize, about, buddhist, clergy, in, the, united, states, pure, land, priests, of, the, japanese, diaspora, serve, a, role, very, similar, to, protestant, ministers, of, the, christian, tradition, meanwhile, reclusive, theravada, forest, monks, in, thailand, live, a, life, devoted, to, meditation, and, the, practice, of, austerities, in, small, communities, in, rural, thailand, a, very, different, life, from, even, their, city, dwelling, counterparts, who, may, be, involved, primarily, in, teaching, the, study, of, scripture, and, the, administration, of, the, nationally, organized, and, government, sponsored, sangha, in, the, zen, traditions, of, china, korea, and, japan, manual, labor, is, an, important, part, of, religious, discipline, meanwhile, in, the, theravada, tradition, prohibitions, against, monks, working, as, laborers, and, farmers, continue, to, be, generally, observed, currently, in, north, america, there, are, both, celibate, and, non, celibate, clergy, in, a, variety, of, buddhist, traditions, from, around, the, world, in, some, cases, they, are, forest, dwelling, monks, of, the, theravada, tradition, and, in, other, cases, they, are, married, clergy, of, a, japanese, zen, lineage, and, may, work, a, secular, job, in, addition, to, their, role, in, the, buddhist, community, there, is, also, a, growing, realization, that, traditional, training, in, ritual, and, meditation, as, well, as, philosophy, may, not, be, sufficient, to, meet, the, needs, and, expectations, of, american, lay, people, some, communities, have, begun, exploring, the, need, for, training, in, counseling, skills, as, well, along, these, lines, at, least, two, fully, accredited, master, of, divinity, programs, are, currently, available, one, at, naropa, university, in, boulder, co, and, one, at, the, university, of, the, west, in, rosemead, ca, titles, for, buddhist, clergy, include, in, theravada, in, mahayana, in, vajrayana, in, general, christian, clergy, are, ordained, that, is, they, are, set, apart, for, specific, ministry, in, religious, rites, others, who, have, definite, roles, in, worship, but, who, are, not, ordained, e, g, laypeople, acting, as, acolytes, are, generally, not, considered, clergy, even, though, they, may, require, some, sort, of, official, approval, to, exercise, these, ministries, types, of, clerics, are, distinguished, from, offices, even, when, the, latter, are, commonly, or, exclusively, occupied, by, clerics, a, roman, catholic, cardinal, for, instance, is, almost, without, exception, a, cleric, but, a, cardinal, is, not, a, type, of, cleric, an, archbishop, is, not, a, distinct, type, of, cleric, but, is, simply, a, bishop, who, occupies, a, particular, position, with, special, authority, conversely, a, youth, minister, at, a, parish, may, or, may, not, be, a, cleric, different, churches, have, different, systems, of, clergy, though, churches, with, similar, polity, have, similar, systems, in, anglicanism, clergy, consist, of, the, orders, of, deacons, priests, presbyters, and, bishops, in, ascending, order, of, seniority, canon, archdeacon, archbishop, and, the, like, are, specific, positions, within, these, orders, bishops, are, typically, overseers, presiding, over, a, diocese, composed, of, many, parishes, with, an, archbishop, presiding, over, a, province, in, most, which, is, a, group, of, dioceses, a, parish, generally, a, single, church, is, looked, after, by, one, or, more, priests, although, one, priest, may, be, responsible, for, several, parishes, new, clergy, are, first, ordained, as, deacons, those, seeking, to, become, priests, are, usually, ordained, to, the, priesthood, around, a, year, later, since, the, 1960s, some, anglican, churches, have, reinstituted, the, permanent, diaconate, in, addition, to, the, transitional, diaconate, as, a, ministry, focused, on, bridges, the, church, and, the, world, especially, ministry, to, those, on, the, margins, of, society, for, a, short, period, of, history, before, the, ordination, of, women, as, deacons, priests, and, bishops, began, within, anglicanism, women, could, be, deaconesses, although, they, were, usually, considered, having, a, ministry, distinct, from, deacons, they, often, had, similar, ministerial, responsibilities, in, anglicanism, all, clergy, are, permitted, to, marry, in, most, national, churches, women, may, become, deacons, or, priests, but, while, fifteen, out, of, 38, national, churches, allow, for, the, consecration, of, women, as, bishops, only, five, have, ordained, any, celebration, of, the, eucharist, is, reserved, for, priests, and, bishops, national, anglican, churches, are, presided, over, by, one, or, more, primates, or, metropolitans, archbishops, or, presiding, bishops, the, senior, archbishop, of, the, anglican, communion, is, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, who, acts, as, leader, of, the, church, of, england, and, first, among, equals, of, the, primates, of, all, anglican, churches, being, a, deacon, priest, or, bishop, is, considered, a, function, of, the, person, and, not, a, job, when, priests, retire, they, are, still, priests, even, if, they, no, longer, have, any, active, ministry, however, they, only, hold, the, basic, rank, after, retirement, thus, a, retired, archbishop, can, only, be, considered, a, bishop, though, it, is, possible, to, refer, to, bishop, john, smith, the, former, archbishop, of, york, a, canon, or, archdeacon, is, a, priest, on, retirement, and, does, not, hold, any, additional, honorifics, for, the, forms, of, address, for, anglican, clergy, see, forms, of, address, in, the, united, kingdom, the, baptist, tradition, only, recognizes, two, ordained, positions, in, the, church, as, being, the, elders, pastors, and, deacons, as, outlined, in, the, third, chapter, of, i, timothy, in, the, bible, ordained, clergy, in, the, catholic, church, are, either, deacons, priests, or, bishops, belonging, to, the, diaconate, the, presbyterate, or, the, episcopate, respectively, among, bishops, some, are, metropolitans, archbishops, or, patriarchs, the, pope, is, the, bishop, of, rome, the, supreme, and, universal, hierarch, of, the, church, and, his, authorization, is, now, required, for, the, ordination, of, all, roman, catholic, bishops, with, rare, exceptions, cardinals, are, bishops, although, it, was, not, always, so, formerly, some, cardinals, were, people, who, had, received, clerical, tonsure, but, not, holy, orders, secular, clergy, are, ministers, such, as, deacons, and, priests, who, do, not, belong, to, a, religious, institute, and, live, in, the, world, at, large, rather, than, a, religious, institute, saeculum, the, holy, see, supports, the, activity, of, its, clergy, by, the, congregation, for, the, clergy, a, dicastery, of, roman, curia, canon, law, indicates, canon, 207, that, y, divine, institution, there, are, among, the, christian, faithful, in, the, church, sacred, ministers, who, in, law, are, also, called, clerics, the, other, members, of, the, christian, faithful, are, called, lay, persons, this, distinction, of, a, separate, ministry, was, formed, in, the, early, times, of, christianity, one, early, source, reflecting, this, distinction, with, the, three, ranks, or, orders, of, bishop, priest, and, deacon, is, the, writings, of, saint, ignatius, of, antioch, holy, orders, is, one, of, the, seven, sacraments, enumerated, at, the, council, of, trent, that, the, magisterium, considers, to, be, of, divine, institution, in, the, catholic, church, only, men, are, permitted, to, be, clerics, in, the, latin, church, before, 1972, tonsure, admitted, someone, to, the, clerical, state, after, which, he, could, receive, the, four, minor, orders, ostiary, lectorate, order, of, exorcists, order, of, acolytes, and, then, the, major, orders, of, subdiaconate, diaconate, presbyterate, and, finally, the, episcopate, which, according, to, roman, catholic, doctrine, is, the, fullness, of, holy, orders, since, 1972, the, minor, orders, and, the, subdiaconate, have, been, replaced, by, lay, ministries, and, clerical, tonsure, no, longer, takes, place, except, in, some, traditionalist, catholic, groups, and, the, clerical, state, is, acquired, even, in, those, groups, by, holy, orders, in, the, latin, church, the, initial, level, of, the, three, ranks, of, holy, orders, is, that, of, the, diaconate, in, addition, to, these, three, orders, of, clerics, some, eastern, catholic, or, uniate, churches, have, what, are, called, minor, clerics, members, of, institutes, of, consecrated, life, and, societies, of, apostolic, life, are, clerics, only, if, they, have, received, holy, orders, thus, unordained, monks, friars, nuns, and, religious, brothers, and, sisters, are, not, part, of, the, clergy, the, code, of, canon, law, and, the, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, prescribe, that, every, cleric, must, be, enrolled, or, incardinated, in, a, diocese, or, its, equivalent, an, apostolic, vicariate, territorial, abbey, personal, prelature, etc, or, in, a, religious, institute, society, of, apostolic, life, or, secular, institute, the, need, for, this, requirement, arose, because, of, the, trouble, caused, from, the, earliest, years, of, the, church, by, unattached, or, vagrant, clergy, subject, to, no, ecclesiastical, authority, and, often, causing, scandal, wherever, they, went, current, canon, law, prescribes, that, to, be, ordained, a, priest, an, education, is, required, of, two, years, of, philosophy, and, four, of, theology, including, study, of, dogmatic, and, moral, theology, the, holy, scriptures, and, canon, law, have, to, be, studied, within, a, seminary, or, an, ecclesiastical, faculty, at, a, university, clerical, celibacy, is, a, requirement, for, almost, all, clergy, in, the, predominant, latin, church, with, the, exception, of, deacons, who, do, not, intend, to, become, priests, exceptions, are, sometimes, admitted, for, ordination, to, transitional, diaconate, and, priesthood, on, a, case, by, case, basis, for, married, clergymen, of, other, churches, or, communities, who, become, catholics, but, consecration, of, already, married, men, as, bishops, is, excluded, in, both, the, latin, and, eastern, catholic, churches, see, personal, ordinariate, clerical, marriage, is, not, allowed, and, therefore, if, those, for, whom, in, some, particular, church, celibacy, is, optional, such, as, permanent, deacons, in, the, latin, church, wish, to, marry, they, must, do, so, before, ordination, eastern, catholic, churches, while, allowing, married, men, to, be, ordained, do, not, allow, clerical, marriage, after, ordination, their, parish, priests, are, often, married, but, must, marry, before, being, ordained, to, the, priesthood, eastern, catholic, churches, require, celibacy, only, for,

offices, identified, in, the, new, testament, and, found, in, the, early, church, as, testified, by, the, writings, of, the, holy, fathers, each, of, these, ranks, is, ordained, through, the, sacred, mystery, sacrament, of, the, laying, on, of, hands, called, cheirotonia, by, bishops, priests, and, deacons, are, ordained, by, their, own, diocesan, bishop, while, bishops, are, consecrated, through, the, laying, on, of, hands, of, at, least, three, other, bishops, within, each, of, these, three, ranks, there, are, found, a, number, of, titles, bishops, may, have, the, title, of, archbishop, metropolitan, and, patriarch, all, of, which, are, considered, honorifics, among, the, orthodox, all, bishops, are, considered, equal, though, an, individual, may, have, a, place, of, higher, or, lower, honor, and, each, has, his, place, within, the, order, of, precedence, priests, also, called, presbyters, may, or, may, not, have, the, title, of, archpriest, protopresbyter, also, called,

ordain, up, through, deacon, during, the, liturgy, of, the, presanctified, gifts, and, no, more, than, a, single, individual, can, be, ordained, to, the, same, rank, in, any, one, service, numerous, members, of, the, lower, clergy, may, be, ordained, at, the, same, service, and, their, blessing, usually, takes, place, during, the, little, hours, prior, to, liturgy, or, may, take, place, as, a, separate, service, the, blessing, of, readers, and, taper, bearers, is, usually, combined, into, a, single, service, subdeacons, are, ordained, during, the, little, hours, but, the, ceremonies,

this, means, is, that, the, sacred, king, or, queen, is, therefore, seen, to, combine, both, kingship, and, priesthood, within, his, or, her, person, even, though, he, or, she, is, often, aided, by, an, actual, high, priest, or, priestess, see, for, example, the, maya, priesthood, when, the, functions, of, political, ruler, and, religious, leader, are, combined, in, this, way, deification, could, be, seen, to, be, the, next, logical, stage, of, his, or, her, social, advancement, within, his, or, her, native, environment, as, is, found, in, the, case, of, the, egyptian, pharaohs, the, vedic, priesthood, of, india, is, an, early, instance, of, a, structured, body, of, clergy, organized, as, a, separate, and, hereditary, caste, one, that, occupied, the, highest, social, rung, of, its, nation, a, modern, example, of, this, phenomenon, the, priestly, monarchs, of, the, yoruba, holy, city, of, ile, ife, in, nigeria, whose, reigning, onis, have, performed, ritual, ceremonies, for, centuries, for, the, sustenance, of, the, entire, planet, and, its, people, in, recent, years, studies, have, suggested, that, american, clergy, in, certain, protestant, evangelical, and, jewish, traditions, are, more, at, risk, than, the, general, population, of, obesity, hypertension, and, depression, their, life, expectancies, have, fallen, in, recent, years, and, in, the, last, decade, their, use, of, antidepressants, has, risen, several, religious, bodies, in, the, united, states, methodist, episcopal, baptist, and, lutheran, have, implemented, measures, to, address, the, issue, through, wellness, campaigns, for, example, but, also, by, simply, ensuring, that, clergy, take, more, time, off, it, is, unclear, whether, similar, symptoms, affect, american, muslim, clerics, although, an, anecdotal, comment, by, one, american, imam, suggested, that, leaders, of, mosques, may, also, share, these, problems, one, exception, to, the, findings, of, these, studies, is, the, case, of, american, catholic, priests, who, are, required, by, canon, law, to, take, a, spiritual, retreat, each, year, and, four, weeks, of, vacation, sociological, studies, at, the, university, of, chicago, have, confirmed, this, exception, the, studies, also, took, the, results, of, several, earlier, studies, into, consideration, and, included, roman, catholic, priests, nationwide, it, remains, unclear, whether, american, clergy, in, other, religious, traditions, experience, the, same, symptoms, or, whether, clergy, outside, the, united, states, are, similarly, affected
