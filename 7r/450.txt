speech, area, stretching, from, djibouti, and, the, somali, region, of, ethiopia, to, the, northern, frontier, district, this, widespread, modern, distribution, is, a, result, of, a, long, series, of, southward, population, movements, over, the, past, ten, centuries, from, the, gulf, of, aden, littoral, lamberti, subdivides, northern, somali, into, three, dialects, northern, somali, proper, spoken, in, the, northwest, he, describes, this, dialect, as, northern, somali, in, the, proper, sense, the, darod, group, spoken, in, the, northeast, and, along, the, eastern, ethiopia, frontier, greatest, number, of, speakers, overall, and, the, lower, juba, group, spoken, by, northern, somali, settlers, in, the, southern, riverine, areas, benadir, also, known, as, coastal, somali, is, spoken, on, the, central, indian, ocean, seaboard, including, mogadishu, it, forms, a, relatively, smaller, group, the, dialect, is, fairly, mutually, intelligible, with, northern, somali, the, language, has, five, basic, vowels, somali, has, 22, consonant, phonemes, the, retroflex, plosive, may, have, an, implosive, quality, for, some, somali, bantu, speakers, and, intervocalically, it, can, be, realized, as, the, flap, some, speakers, produce, with, epiglottal, trilling, as, in, retrospect, q, is, often, epiglottalized, the, letter, dh, is, a, retroflex, flap, when, it, is, pronounced, intervocalically, hence, becoming, the, phoneme, for, example, qu, r, aanjo, ant, from, qu, dh, aanjo, but, however, more, often, than, not, is, the, pronouncement, of, to, the, unretained, retroflex, the, letter, kh, is, rarely, pronounced, as, a, velar, fricative, partially, the, reason, why, is, that, it, is, mostly, found, in, arabic, loanwords, it, is, pronounced, as, the, phoneme, when, it, is, an, allophone, for, the, letter, q, in, syllabic, codas, as, in, a, kh, ri, from, a, q, ri, meaning, read, pitch, is, phonemic, in, somali, but, it, is, debated, whether, somali, is, a, pitch, accent, or, it, is, a, tonal, language, andrzejewski, 1954, posits, that, somali, is, a, tonal, language, whereas, banti, 1988, suggests, that, it, is, a, pitch, system, the, syllable, structure, of, somali, is, c, v, c, root, morphemes, usually, have, a, mono, or, di, syllabic, structure, clusters, of, two, consonants, do, not, occur, word, initially, or, word, finally, i, e, they, only, occur, at, syllable, boundaries, the, following, consonants, can, be, geminate, b, d, m, n, r, and, l, the, following, cannot, be, geminate, t, k, and, the, fricatives, two, vowels, cannot, occur, together, at, syllable, boundaries, epenthetic, consonants, e, g, and, are, therefore, inserted, somali, is, an, agglutinative, language, and, also, shows, properties, of, inflection, affixes, mark, many, grammatical, meanings, including, aspect, tense, and, case, somali, has, an, old, prefixal, verbal, inflection, restricted, to, four, common, verbs, with, all, other, verbs, undergoing, inflection, by, more, obvious, suffixation, this, general, pattern, is, similar, to, the, stem, alternation, that, typifies, cairene, arabic, somali, has, two, sets, of, pronouns, independent, substantive, emphatic, pronouns, and, clitic, verbal, pronouns, the, independent, pronouns, behave, grammatically, as, nouns, and, normally, occur, with, the, suffixed, article, ka, ta, e, g, adiga, you, this, article, may, be, omitted, after, a, conjunction, or, focus, word, for, example, adna, meaning, and, you, from, adi, na, clitic, pronouns, are, attached, to, the, verb, and, do, not, take, nominal, morphology, somali, marks, clusivity, in, the, first, person, plural, pronouns, this, is, also, found, in, a, number, of, other, east, cushitic, languages, such, as, rendille, and, dhaasanac, as, in, various, other, afro, asiatic, languages, somali, is, characterized, by, polarity, of, gender, whereby, plural, nouns, usually, take, the, opposite, gender, agreement, of, their, singular, forms, for, example, the, plural, of, the, masculine, noun, dibi, bull, is, formed, by, converting, it, into, feminine, dibi, somali, is, unusual, among, the, world, s, languages, in, that, the, object, is, unmarked, for, case, while, the, subject, is, marked, though, this, feature, is, found, in, other, cushitic, languages, such, as, oromo, somali, is, a, subject, object, verb, sov, language, it, is, largely, head, final, with, postpositions, and, with, obliques, preceding, verbs, these, are, common, features, of, the, cushitic, and, semitic, afroasiatic, languages, spoken, in, the, horn, region, e, g, amharic, however, somali, noun, phrases, are, head, initial, whereby, the, noun, precedes, its, modifying, adjective, this, pattern, of, general, head, finality, with, head, initial, noun, phrases, is, also, found, in, other, cushitic, languages, e, g, oromo, but, not, generally, in, ethiopian, semitic, languages, somali, uses, three, focus, markers, baa, ayaa, and, waxa, a, which, generally, mark, new, information, or, contrastive, emphasis, baa, and, ayaa, require, the, focused, element, to, occur, preverbally, while, waxa, a, may, be, used, following, the, verb, somali, loanwords, can, be, divided, into, those, derived, from, other, afroasiatic, languages, mainly, arabic, and, those, of, indo, european, extraction, mainly, italian, somali, s, main, lexical, borrowings, come, from, arabic, and, are, estimated, to, constitute, about, 20, of, the, language, s, vocabulary, this, is, a, legacy, of, the, somali, people, s, extensive, social, cultural, commercial, and, religious, links, and, contacts, with, nearby, populations, in, the, arabian, peninsula, arabic, loanwords, are, most, commonly, used, in, religious, administrative, and, education, related, speech, e, g, aamiin, for, faith, in, god, though, they, are, also, present, in, other, areas, e, g, kubbad, da, ball, soravia, 1994, noted, a, total, of, 1, 436, arabic, loanwords, in, agostini, a, o, 1985, a, prominent, 40, 000, entry, somali, dictionary, most, of, the, terms, consisted, of, commonly, used, nouns, these, lexical, borrowings, may, have, been, more, extensive, in, the, past, since, a, few, words, that, zaborski, 1967, 122, observed, in, the, older, literature, were, absent, in, agostini, s, later, work, in, addition, the, majority, of, personal, names, are, derived, from, arabic, the, somali, language, also, contains, a, few, indo, european, loanwords, that, were, retained, from, the, colonial, period, most, of, these, lexical, borrowings, come, from, english, and, italian, and, are, used, to, describe, modern, concepts, e, g, telefishen, ka, the, television, raadia, ha, the, radio, there, are, 300, loan, words, from, italian, such, as, garawati, for, tie, from, italian, cravatta, dimuqraadi, from, democratico, democratic, mikroskoob, from, microscopio, and, so, on, additionally, somali, contains, lexical, terms, from, persian, urdu, and, hindi, that, were, acquired, through, historical, trade, with, communities, in, the, near, east, and, south, asia, e, g, khiyaar, cucumber, from, persian, khiy, r, other, loan, words, have, also, displaced, their, native, synonyms, in, some, dialects, e, g, jabaati, a, type, of, flat, bread, from, hindi, chap, ti, displacing, sabaayad, some, of, these, words, were, also, borrowed, indirectly, via, arabic, as, part, of, a, broader, governmental, effort, of, linguistic, purism, in, the, somali, language, the, past, few, decades, have, seen, a, push, in, somalia, toward, replacement, of, loanwords, in, general, with, their, somali, equivalents, or, neologisms, to, this, end, the, supreme, revolutionary, council, during, its, tenure, officially, prohibited, the, borrowing, and, use, of, english, and, italian,

great, britain, scientist, johann, maria, hildebrandt, noted, upon, visiting, the, area, that, we, know, from, ancient, authors, that, these, districts, at, present, so, desert, were, formerly, populous, and, civilised, i, also, discovered, ancient, ruins, and, rock, inscriptions, both, in, pictures, and, characters, these, have, hitherto, not, been, deciphered, according, to, the, 1974, report, for, ministry, of, information, and, national, guidance, this, script, represents, the, earliest, written, attestation, of, somali, much, more, recently, somali, archaeologist, sada, mire, has, published, ancient, inscriptions, found, throughout, somaliland, as, much, for, much, of, somali, linguistic, history, the, language, was, not, widely, used, for, literature, dr, mire, s,

established, arabic, script, and, wadaad, s, writing, according, to, bogumi, andrzejewski, this, usage, was, limited, to, somali, clerics, and, their, associates, as, sheikhs, preferred, to, write, in, the, liturgical, arabic, language, various, such, historical, manuscripts, in, somali, nonetheless, exist, which, mainly, consist, of, islamic, poems, qasidas, recitations, and, chants, among, these, texts, are, the, somali, poems, by, sheikh, uways, and, sheikh, ismaaciil, faarah, the, rest, of, the, existing, historical, literature, in, somali, principally, consists, of, translations, of, documents, from, arabic, since, then, a, number, of, writing, systems, have, been, used, for, transcribing, the, somali, language, of, these, the, somali, latin, alphabet, officially, adopted, in,
