laws, of, the, church, and, were, not, subject, to, the, king, s, laws, or, courts, this, presented, problems, for, the, city, of, paris, as, students, ran, wild, and, its, official, had, to, appeal, to, church, courts, for, justice, students, were, often, very, young, entering, the, school, at, 13, or, 14, years, of, age, and, staying, for, six, to, 12, years, three, schools, were, especially, famous, in, paris, the, palatine, or, palace, school, the, school, of, notre, dame, and, that, of, sainte, genevi, ve, abbey, the, latter, two, although, ancient, were, initially, eclipsed, by, the, palatine, school, until, the, decline, of, royalty, brought, about, its, decline, the, first, renowned, professor, at, the, school, of, ste, genevi, ve, was, hubold, who, lived, in, the, tenth, century, not, content, with, the, courses, at, li, ge, he, continued, his, studies, at, paris, entered, or, allied, himself, with, the, chapter, of, ste, genevi, ve, and, attracted, many, pupils, via, his, teaching, distinguished, professors, from, the, school, of, notre, dame, in, the, eleventh, century, include, lambert, disciple, of, fulbert, of, chartres, drogo, of, paris, manegold, of, germany, and, anselm, of, laon, these, two, schools, attracted, scholars, from, every, country, and, produced, many, illustrious, men, among, whom, were, st, stanislaus, of, szczepan, w, bishop, of, krak, w, gebbard, archbishop, of, salzburg, st, stephen, third, abbot, of, c, teaux, robert, d, arbrissel, founder, of, the, abbey, of, fontevrault, etc, three, other, men, who, added, prestige, to, the, schools, of, notre, dame, and, ste, genevi, ve, were, william, of, champeaux, ab, lard, and, peter, lombard, humanistic, instruction, comprised, grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and, astronomy, trivium, and, quadrivium, to, the, higher, instruction, belonged, dogmatic, and, moral, theology, whose, source, was, the, scriptures, and, the, patristic, fathers, it, was, completed, by, the, study, of, canon, law, the, school, of, saint, victor, arose, to, rival, those, of, notre, dame, and, ste, genevi, ve, it, was, founded, by, william, of, champeaux, when, he, withdrew, to, the, abbey, of, saint, victor, its, most, famous, professors, are, hugh, of, st, victor, and, richard, of, st, victor, the, plan, of, studies, expanded, in, the, schools, of, paris, as, it, did, elsewhere, a, bolognese, compendium, of, canon, law, called, the, decretum, gratiani, brought, about, a, division, of, the, theology, department, hitherto, the, discipline, of, the, church, had, not, been, separate, from, so, called, theology, they, were, studied, together, under, the, same, professor, but, this, vast, collection, necessitated, a, special, course, which, was, undertaken, first, at, bologna, where, roman, law, was, taught, in, france, first, orl, ans, and, then, paris, erected, chairs, of, canon, law, before, the, end, of, the, twelfth, century, the, decretals, of, gerard, la, pucelle, mathieu, d, angers, and, anselm, or, anselle, of, paris, were, added, to, the, decretum, gratiani, however, civil, law, was, not, included, at, paris, in, the, twelfth, century, medicine, began, to, be, publicly, taught, at, paris, the, first, professor, of, medicine, in, paris, records, is, hugo, physicus, excellens, qui, quadrivium, docuit, professors, were, required, to, have, measurable, knowledge, and, be, appointed, by, the, university, applicants, had, to, be, assessed, by, examination, if, successful, the, examiner, who, was, the, head, of, the, school, and, known, as, scholasticus, capiscol, and, chancellor, appointed, an, individual, to, teach, this, was, called, the, licence, or, faculty, to, teach, the, licence, had, to, be, granted, freely, no, one, could, teach, without, it, on, the, other, hand, the, examiner, could, not, refuse, to, award, it, when, the, applicant, deserved, it, the, school, of, saint, victor, under, the, abbey, conferred, the, licence, in, its, own, right, the, school, of, notre, dame, depended, on, the, diocese, that, of, ste, genevi, ve, on, the, abbey, or, chapter, the, diocese, and, the, abbey, or, chapter, through, their, chancellor, gave, professorial, investiture, in, their, respective, territories, where, they, had, jurisdiction, besides, notre, dame, ste, genevi, ve, and, saint, victor, there, were, several, schools, on, the, island, and, on, the, mount, whoever, says, crevier, had, the, right, to, teach, might, open, a, school, where, he, pleased, provided, it, was, not, in, the, vicinity, of, a, principal, school, thus, a, certain, adam, who, was, of, english, origin, kept, his, near, the, petit, pont, another, adam, parisian, by, birth, taught, at, the, grand, pont, which, is, called, the, pont, au, change, hist, de, l, univers, de, paris, i, 272, the, number, of, students, in, the, school, of, the, capital, grew, constantly, so, that, lodgings, were, insufficient, french, students, included, princes, of, the, blood, sons, of, the, nobility, and, ranking, gentry, the, courses, at, paris, were, considered, so, necessary, as, a, completion, of, studies, that, many, foreigners, flocked, to, them, popes, celestine, ii, adrian, iv, and, innocent, iii, studied, at, paris, and, alexander, iii, sent, his, nephews, there, noted, german, and, english, students, included, otto, of, freisingen, cardinal, conrad, archbishop, of, mainz, st, thomas, of, canterbury, and, john, of, salisbury, while, ste, genevi, ve, became, practically, the, seminary, for, denmark, the, chroniclers, of, the, time, called, paris, the, city, of, letters, par, excellence, placing, it, above, athens, alexandria, rome, and, other, cities, at, that, time, there, flourished, at, paris, philosophy, and, all, branches, of, learning, and, there, the, seven, arts, were, studied, and, held, in, such, esteem, as, they, never, were, at, athens, egypt, rome, or, elsewhere, in, the, world, les, gestes, de, philippe, auguste, poets, extolled, the, university, in, their, verses, comparing, it, to, all, that, was, greatest, noblest, and, most, valuable, in, the, world, to, allow, poor, students, to, study, the, first, college, des, dix, huit, was, founded, by, a, knight, returning, from, jerusalem, called, josse, of, london, for, 18, scholars, who, received, lodgings, and, 12, pence, or, denarii, a, month, as, the, university, developed, it, became, more, institutionalized, first, the, professors, formed, an, association, for, according, to, matthew, paris, john, of, celles, twenty, first, abbot, of, st, albans, england, was, admitted, as, a, member, of, the, teaching, corps, of, paris, after, he, had, followed, the, courses, vita, joannis, i, xxi, abbat, s, alban, the, masters, as, well, as, the, students, were, divided, according, to, national, origin, alban, wrote, that, henry, ii, king, of, england, in, his, difficulties, with, st, thomas, of, canterbury, wanted, to, submit, his, cause, to, a, tribunal, composed, of, professors, of, paris, chosen, from, various, provinces, hist, major, henry, ii, to, end, of, 1169, this, was, likely, the, start, of, the, division, according, to, nations, which, was, later, to, play, an, important, part, in, the, university, celestine, iii, ruled, that, both, professors, and, students, had, the, privilege, of, being, subject, only, to, the, ecclesiastical, courts, not, to, civil, courts, the, three, schools, notre, dame, sainte, genevi, ve, and, saint, victor, may, be, regarded, as, the, triple, cradle, of, the, universitas, scholarium, which, included, masters, and, students, hence, the, name, university, henry, denifle, and, some, others, hold, that, this, honour, is, exclusive, to, the, school, of, notre, dame, chartularium, universitatis, parisiensis, but, the, reasons, do, not, seem, convincing, he, excludes, saint, victor, because, at, the, request, of, the, abbot, and, the, religious, of, saint, victor, gregory, ix, in, 1237, authorized, them, to, resume, the, interrupted, teaching, of, theology, but, the, university, was, largely, founded, about, 1208, as, is, shown, by, a, bull, of, innocent, iii, consequently, the, schools, of, saint, victor, might, well, have, contributed, to, its, formation, secondly, denifle, excludes, the, schools, of, ste, genevi, ve, because, there, had, been, no, interruption, in, the, teaching, of, the, liberal, arts, this, is, debatable, and, through, the, period, theology, was, taught, the, chancellor, of, ste, genevi, ve, continued, to, give, degrees, in, arts, something, he, would, have, ceased, if, his, abbey, had, no, part, in, the, university, organization, in, 1200, king, philip, ii, issued, a, diploma, for, the, security, of, the, scholars, of, paris, which, affirmed, that, students, were, subject, only, to, ecclesiastical, jurisdiction, the, provost, and, other, officers, were, forbidden, to, arrest, a, student, for, any, offence, unless, to, transfer, him, to, ecclesiastical, authority, the, king, s, officers, could, not, intervene, with, any, member, unless, having, a, mandate, from, an, ecclesiastical, authority, his, action, followed, a, violent, incident, between, students, and, officers, outside, the, city, walls, at, a, pub, in, 1215, the, apostolic, legate, robert, de, cour, on, issued, new, rules, governing, who, could, become, a, professor, to, teach, the, arts, a, candidate, had, to, be, at, least, twenty, one, to, have, studied, these, arts, at, least, six, years, and, to, take, an, engagement, as, professor, for, at, least, two, years, for, a, chair, in, theology, the, candidate, had, to, be, thirty, years, of, age, with, eight, years, of, theological, studies, of, which, the, last, three, years, were, devoted, to, special, courses, of, lectures, in, preparation, for, the, mastership, these, studies, had, to, be, made, in, the, local, schools, under, the, direction, of, a, master, in, paris, one, was, regarded, as, a, scholar, only, by, studies, with, particular, masters, lastly, purity, of, morals, was, as, important, as, reading, the, licence, was, granted, according, to, custom, gratuitously, without, oath, or, condition, masters, and, students, were, permitted, to, unite, even, by, oath, in, defence, of, their, rights, when, they, could, not, otherwise, obtain, justice, in, serious, matters, no, mention, is, made, either, of, law, or, of, medicine, probably, because, these, sciences, were, less, prominent, in, 1229, a, denial, of, justice, by, the, queen, led, to, suspension, of, the, courses, the, pope, intervened, with, a, bull, that, began, with, lavish, praise, of, the, university, paris, said, gregory, ix, mother, of, the, sciences, is, another, cariath, sepher, city, of, letters, he, commissioned, the, bishops, of, le, mans, and, senlis, and, the, archdeacon, of, ch, lons, to, negotiate, with, the, french, court, for, the, restoration, of, the, university, but, by, the, end, of, 1230, they, had, accomplished, nothing, gregory, ix, then, addressed, a, bull, of, 1231, to, the, masters, and, scholars, of, paris, not, only, did, he, settle, the, dispute, he, empowered, the, university, to, frame, statutes, concerning, the, discipline, of, the, schools, the, method, of, instruction, the, defence, of, theses, the, costume, of, the, professors, and, the, obsequies, of, masters, and, students, expanding, upon, robert, de, cour, on, s, statutes, most, importantly, the, pope, granted, the, university, the, right, to, suspend, its, courses, if, justice, were, denied, it, until, it, should, receive, full, satisfaction, the, pope, authorized, pierre, le, mangeur, to, collect, a, moderate, fee, for, the, conferring, of, the, license, of, professorship, also, for, the, first, time, the, scholars, had, to, pay, tuition, fees, for, their, education, two, sous, weekly, to, be, deposited, in, the, common, fund, the, university, was, organized, as, follows, at, the, head, of, the, teaching, body, was, a, rector, the, office, was, elective, and, of, short, duration, at, first, it, was, limited, to, four, or, six, weeks, simon, de, brion, legate, of, the, holy, see, in, france, realizing, that, such, frequent, changes, caused, serious, inconvenience, decided, that, the, rectorate, should, last, three, months, and, this, rule, was, observed, for, three, years, then, the, term, was, lengthened, to, one, two, and, sometimes, three, years, the, right, of, election, belonged, to, the, procurators, of, the, four, nations, henry, of, unna, was, proctor, of, the, university, of, paris, in, the, 14th, century, beginning, his, term, on, january, 13, 1340, the, nations, appeared, in, the, second, half, of, the, twelfth, century, they, were, mentioned, in, the, bull, of, honorius, iii, in, 1222, later, they, formed, a, distinct, body, by, 1249, the, four, nations, existed, with, their, procurators, their, rights, more, or, less, well, defined, and, their, keen, rivalries, the, nations, were, the, french, english, normans, and, picards, after, the, hundred, years, war, the, english, nation, was, replaced, by, the, germanic, the, four, nations, constituted, the, faculty, of, arts, or, letters, the, territories, covered, by, the, four, nations, were, to, classify, professors, knowledge, the, schools, of, paris, gradually, divided, into, faculties, professors, of, the, same, science, were, brought, into, closer, contact, until, the, community, of, rights, and, interests, cemented, the, union, and, made, them, distinct, groups, the, faculty, of, medicine, seems, to, have, been, the, last, to, form, but, the, four, faculties, were, already, formally, established, by, 1254, when, the, university, described, in, a, letter, theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and, rational, natural, and, moral, philosophy, the, masters, of, theology, often, set, the, example, for, the, other, faculties, e, g, they, were, the, first, to, adopt, an, official, seal, the, faculties, of, theology, canon, law, and, medicine, were, called, superior, faculties, the, title, of, dean, as, designating, the, head, of, a, faculty, came, into, use, by, 1268, in, the, faculties, of, law, and, medicine, and, by, 1296, in, the, faculty, of, theology, it, seems, that, at, first, the, deans, were, the, oldest, masters, the, faculty, of, arts, continued, to, have, four, procurators, of, its, four, nations, and, its, head, was, the, rector, as, the, faculties, became, more, fully, organized, the, division, into, four, nations, partially, disappeared, for, theology, law, and, medicine, though, it, continued, in, arts, eventually, the, superior, faculties, included, only, doctors, leaving, the, bachelors, to, the, faculty, of, arts, at, this, period, therefore, the, university, had, two, principal, degrees, the, baccalaureate, and, the, doctorate, it, was, not, until, much, later, that, the, licentiate, and, the, dea, became, intermediate, degrees, the, scattered, condition, of, the, scholars, in, paris, often, made, lodging, difficult, some, students, rented, rooms, from, townspeople, who, often, exacted, high, rates, while, the, students, demanded, lower, this, tension, between, scholars, and, citizens, would, have, developed, into, a, sort, of, civil, war, if, robert, de, cour, on, had, not, found, the, remedy, of, taxation, it, was, upheld, in, the, bull, of, gregory, ix, of, 1231, but, with, an, important, modification, its, exercise, was, to, be, shared, with, the, citizens, the, aim, was, to, offer, the, students, a, shelter, where, they, would, fear, neither, annoyance, from, the, owners, nor, the, dangers, of, the, world, thus, were, founded, the, colleges, colligere, to, assemble, meaning, not, centers, of, instruction, but, simple, student, boarding, houses, each, had, a, special, goal, being, established, for, students, of, the, same, nationality, or, the, same, science, often, masters, lived, in, each, college, and, oversaw, its, activities, four, colleges, appeared, in, the, 12th, century, they, became, more, numerous, in, the, 13th, including, coll, ge, d, harcourt, 1280, and, the, coll, ge, de, sorbonne, 1257, thus, the, university, of, paris, assumed, its, basic, form, it, was, composed, of, seven, groups, the, four, nations, of, the, faculty, of, arts, and, the, three, superior, faculties, of, theology, law, and, medicine, men, who, had, studied, at, paris, became, an, increasing, presence, in, the, high, ranks, of, the, church, hierarchy, eventually, students, at, the, university, of, paris, saw, it, as, a, right, that, they, would, be, eligible, to, benefices, church, officials, such, as, st, louis, and, clement, iv, lavishly, praised, the, university, besides, the, famous, coll, ge, de, sorbonne, other, collegia, provided, housing, and, meals, to, students, sometimes, for, those, of, the, same, geographical, origin, in, a, more, restricted, sense, than, that, represented, by, the, nations, there, were, 8, or, 9, collegia, for, foreign, students, the, oldest, one, was, the, danish, college, the, collegium, danicum, or, dacicum, founded, in, 1257, swedish, students, could, during, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, live, in, one, of, three, swedish, colleges, the, collegium, upsaliense, the, collegium, scarense, or, the, collegium, lincopense, named, after, the, swedish, dioceses, of, uppsala, skara, and, link, ping, the, coll, ge, de, navarre, was, founded, in, 1305, originally, aimed, at, students, from, navarre, but, due, to, its, size, wealth, and, the, links, between, the, crowns, of, france, and, navarre, it, quickly, accepted, students, from, other, nations, the, establishment, of, the, college, of, navarre, was, a, turning, point, in, the, university, s, history, navarra, was, the, first, college, to, offer, teaching, to, its, students, which, at, the, time, set, it, apart, from, all, previous, colleges, founded, as, charitable, institutions, that, provided, lodging, but, no, tuition, navarre, s, model, combining, lodging, and, tuition, would, be, reproduced, by, other, colleges, both, in, paris, and, other, universities, the, german, college, collegium, alemanicum, is, mentioned, as, early, as, 1345, the, scots, college, or, collegium, scoticum, was, founded, in, 1325, the, lombard, college, or, collegium, lombardicum, was, founded, in, the, 1330s, the, collegium, constantinopolitanum, was, according, to, a, tradition, founded, in, the, 13th, century, to, facilitate, a, merging, of, the, eastern, and, western, churches, it, was, later, reorganized, as, a, french, institution, the, coll, ge, de, la, marche, winville, the, coll, ge, de, montaigu, was, founded, by, the, archbishop, of, rouen, in, the, 14th, century, and, reformed, in, the, 15th, century, by, the, humanist, jan, standonck, when, it, attracted, reformers, from, within, the, roman, catholic, church, such, as, erasmus, and, ignatius, of, loyola, and, those, who, subsequently, became, protestants, john, calvin, and, john, knox, at, this, time, the, university, also, went, the, controversy, of, the, condemnations, of, 1210, 1277, the, irish, college, in, paris, originated, in, 1578, with, students, dispersed, between, coll, ge, montaigu, coll, ge, de, boncourt, and, the, coll, ge, de, navarre, in, 1677, it, was, awarded, possession, of, the, coll, ge, des, lombards, a, new, irish, college, was, built, in, 1769, in, rue, du, cheval, vert, now, rue, des, irlandais, which, exists, today, as, the, irish, chaplaincy, and, cultural, centre, in, the, fifteenth, century, guillaume, d, estouteville, a, cardinal, and, apostolic, legate, reformed, the, university, correcting, its, perceived, abuses, and, introducing, various, modifications, this, reform, was, less, an, innovation, than, a, recall, to, observance, of, the, old, rules, as, was, the, reform, of, 1600, undertaken, by, the, royal, government, with, regard, to, the, three, higher, faculties, nonetheless, and, as, to, the, faculty, of, arts, the, reform, of, 1600, introduced, the,
