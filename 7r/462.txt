as, part, of, the, javo, sumatra, hesion, which, also, includes, the, sundanese, and, malayic, languages, this, grouping, is, also, called, malayo, javanic, by, linguist, berndt, nothofer, who, was, the, first, to, attempt, a, reconstruction, of, it, based, on, only, four, languages, with, the, best, attestation, at, the, time, javanese, sundanese, madurese, and, malay, malayo, javanic, has, been, criticized, and, rejected, by, various, linguists, alexander, adelaar, does, not, include, javanese, in, his, proposed, malayo, sumbawan, grouping, which, also, covers, malayic, sundanese, and, madurese, languages, robert, blust, also, does, not, include, javanese, in, the, greater, north, borneo, subgroup, which, he, proposes, as, an, alternative, to, malayo, sumbawan, grouping, however, blust, also, expresses, the, possibility, that, greater, north, borneo, languages, are, closely, related, to, many, other, western, indonesian, languages, including, javanese, blust, s, suggestion, has, been, further, elaborated, by, alexander, smith, who, includes, javanese, in, the, western, indonesian, grouping, which, also, includes, gnb, and, several, other, subgroups, which, smith, considers, as, one, of, malayo, polynesian, s, primary, branches, in, general, the, history, of, the, javanese, language, can, be, divided, into, two, distinct, phases, 1, old, javanese, and, 2, new, javanese, the, earliest, attested, form, of, old, javanese, can, be, found, on, the, sukabumi, inscription, which, dates, from, 804, ce, between, the, 8th, and, the, 15th, century, this, form, of, javanese, flourished, in, the, island, of, java, old, javanese, is, commonly, written, in, the, form, of, verses, this, language, variety, is, also, called, kawi, or, of, poets, poetical, s, although, this, term, could, also, be, used, to, refer, to, the, archaic, elements, of, new, javanese, literature, the, writing, system, used, to, write, old, javanese, is, a, descendant, of, the, pallava, script, from, india, almost, half, of, the, entire, vocabularies, found, in, old, javanese, literature, are, sanskrit, loanwords, although, old, javanese, also, borrowed, terms, from, other, languages, in, the, maritime, southeast, asia, the, form, of, old, javanese, found, in, several, texts, from, 14th, century, onward, mostly, written, in, bali, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, middle, javanese, both, old, and, middle, javanese, written, forms, have, not, been, widely, used, in, java, since, early, 16th, century, however, old, javanese, works, and, poetic, tradition, continue, to, be, preserved, in, the, javanese, influenced, bali, and, the, variety, is, also, used, for, religious, purposes, modern, javanese, emerged, as, the, main, literary, form, of, the, language, in, the, 16th, century, the, change, in, the, literary, system, happened, as, islam, started, to, gain, influence, in, java, in, its, early, form, modern, javanese, literary, form, was, based, on, the, variety, spoken, in, the, north, coast, of, java, where, islam, had, already, gained, foothold, among, the, local, people, many, of, the, written, works, in, this, variety, were, islamic, in, nature, and, several, of, them, were, translation, from, works, in, malay, the, arabic, abjad, was, also, adopted, as, pegon, to, write, javanese, the, rise, of, mataram, in, the, 17th, century, shifted, the, main, literary, form, of, javanese, to, be, based, on, the, inland, variety, this, written, tradition, was, preserved, by, writers, of, surakarta, and, yogyakarta, and, later, became, the, basis, of, the, modern, written, standard, of, the, language, another, linguistic, development, associated, with, the, rise, of, mataram, is, the, stratification, of, javanese, into, speech, levels, such, as, ngoko, and, krama, which, were, unknown, in, old, javanese, books, in, javanese, have, been, printed, since, 1830s, at, first, using, the, javanese, script, although, the, latin, alphabet, started, to, be, used, later, since, mid, 19th, century, javanese, has, been, used, in, newspapers, and, travelogues, and, later, also, novels, short, stories, as, well, as, free, verses, today, it, is, used, in, media, ranging, from, books, to, tv, programs, and, the, language, is, also, taught, at, schools, in, primarily, javanese, areas, although, javanese, is, not, a, national, language, it, has,

where, javanese, is, the, dominant, language, all, seven, indonesian, presidents, since, 1945, have, been, of, javanese, descent, it, is, therefore, not, surprising, that, javanese, has, had, a, deep, influence, on, the, development, of, indonesian, the, national, language, of, indonesia, there, are, three, main, dialects, of, the, modern, language, central, javanese, eastern, javanese, and,

the, latter, sounds, are, transcribed, as, th, and, dh, in, the, modern, roman, script, but, previously, by, the, use, of, an, underdot, and, javanese, like, many, other, austronesian, languages, is, an, agglutinative, language, where, base, words, are, modified, through, extensive, use, of, affixes, javanese, has, no, specific, personal, pronoun, to, express, plural, except, for, kita, which, was, influenced, by, indonesian, s, first, person, plural, inclusive, pronoun, pronoun, pluralization, can, be, ignored, or, expressed, by, using, phrases, such, as, aku, kab, h, we, awak, dh, w, us, dh, w, k, kab, h, them, and, so, on, personal, pronoun, in, javanese, especially, for, the, second, and, third, person, are, more, often, replaced, by, certain, nouns, or, titles, in, addition, to, the, pronoun, described, in, the, table, below, javanese, still, has, a, variety, of, other, pronoun, whose, use, varies, depending, on, the, dialect, or, level, of, speech, i, you, he, she, it, panjenenganipun, modern, javanese, usually, employs, svo, word, order, however, old, javanese, sometimes, had, vso, and, sometimes, vos, word, order, even, in, modern, javanese, archaic, sentences, using, vso, structure, can, still, be, made, examples, both, sentences, mean, he, s, comes, v, into, pp, the, def, art, palace, o, in, the, old, javanese, sentence, the, verb, is, placed, at, the, beginning, and, is, separated, by, the, particle, ta, from, the, rest, of, the, sentence, in, modern, javanese, the, definite, article, is, lost, and, definiteness, is, expressed, by, other, means, if, necessary, verbs, are, not, inflected, for, person, or, number, there, is, no, grammatical, tense, time, is, expressed, by, auxiliary, words, meaning, yesterday, already, etc, there, is, a, complex, system, of, verb, affixes, to, express, differences, of, status, in, subject, and, object, however, in, general, the, structure, of, javanese, sentences, both, old, and, modern, can, be, described, using, the, topic, comment, model, without, having, to, refer, to, conventional, grammatical, categories, the, topic, is, the, head, of, the, sentence, the, comment, is, the, modifier, so, the, example, sentence, has, a, simpler, description, dh, w, k, topic, teka, comment, ing, karaton, setting, javanese, has, many, loanwords, supplementing, those, from, the, native, austronesian, base, sanskrit, has, had, a, deep, and, lasting, impact, the, old, javanese, english, dictionary, contains, approximately, 25, 500, entries, over, 12, 600, of, which, are, borrowings, from, sanskrit, such, a, high, number, is, no, measure, of, usage, but, it, does, suggest, the, extent, to, which, the, language, adopted, sanskrit, words, for, formal, purposes, in, a, typical, old, javanese, literary, work, about, 25, of, the, vocabulary, is, from, sanskrit, many, javanese, personal, names, also, have, clearly, recognisable, sanskrit, roots, sanskrit, words, are, still, very, much, in, use, modern, speakers, may, describe, old, javanese, and, sanskrit, words, as, kawi, roughly, meaning, literary, but, kawi, words, may, also, be, from, arabic, dutch, and, malay, are, influential, as, well, but, none, of, these, rivals, the, position, of, sanskrit, there, are, far, fewer, arabic, loanwords, in, javanese, than, in, malay, and, they, are, usually, concerned, with, islamic, religion, nevertheless, some, words, have, entered, the, basic, vocabulary, such, as, pikir, to, think, from, the, arabic, fikr, badan, body, mripat, eye, thought, to, be, derived, from, the, arabic, ma, rifah, meaning, knowledge, or, vision, however, these, arabic, words, typically, have, native, austronesian, or, sanskrit, alternatives, pikir, galih, idhep, austronesian, and, manah, cipta, or, cita, from, sanskrit, badan, awak, austronesian, and, slira, sarira, or, angga, from, sanskrit, and, mripat, mata, austronesian, and, soca, or, n, tra, from, sanskrit, dutch, loanwords, usually, have, the, same, form, and, meaning, as, in, indonesian, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, the, word, sepur, also, exists, in, indonesian, but, there, it, has, preserved, the, literal, dutch, meaning, of, railway, tracks, while, the, javanese, word, follows, dutch, figurative, use, and, spoor, lit, rail, is, used, as, metonymy, for, trein, lit, train, compare, a, similar, metonymic, use, in, english, to, travel, by, rail, may, be, used, for, to, travel, by, train, malay, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, indonesian, archipelago, before, the, proclamation, of, indonesian, independence, in, 1945, and, indonesian, which, was, based, on, malay, is, now, the, official, language, of, indonesia, as, a, consequence, there, has, been, an, influx, of, malay, and, indonesian, vocabulary, into, javanese, many, of, these, words, are, concerned, with, bureaucracy, or, politics, in, common, with, other, austronesian, languages, javanese, is, spoken, differently, depending, on, the, social, context, in, austronesian, there, are, often, three, distinct, styles, or, registers, each, employs, its, own, vocabulary, grammatical, rules, and, even, prosody, in, javanese, these, styles, are, called, there, are, also, meta, style, honorific, words, and, their, converse, humilifics, speakers, use, humble, words, concerning, themselves, but, honorific, words, concerning, anyone, of, greater, age, of, higher, social, status, the, humilific, words, are, called, krama, andhap, while, the, honorifics, are, called, krama, inggil, this, honorific, system, is, very, similar, to, that, of, the, japanese, keigo, and, was, likely, influenced, by, it, during, the, japanese, empire, s, occupation, of, java, in, world, war, ii, children, typically, use, the, ngoko, style, but, in, talking, to, the, parents, they, must, be, competent, with, both, krama, inggil, and, krama, andhap, the, most, polite, word, meaning, eat, is, dhahar, but, it, is, forbidden, to, use, these, most, polite, words, for, oneself, except, when, talking, with, someone, of, lower, status, and, in, this, case, ngoko, style, is, used, such, most, polite, words, are, reserved, for, addressing, people, of, higher, status, the, use, of, these, different, styles, is, complicated, and, requires, thorough, knowledge, of, javanese, culture, which, adds, to, the, difficulty, of, javanese, for, foreigners, the, full, system, is, not, usually, mastered, by, most, javanese, themselves, who, might, use, only, the, ngoko, and, a, rudimentary, form, of, the, krama, people, who, can, correctly, use, the, different, styles, are, held, in, high, esteem, there, are, three, main, groups, of, javanese, dialects, based, on, sub, regions, western, javanese, central, javanese, and, eastern, javanese, the, differences, are, primarily, in, pronunciation, but, with, vocabulary, differences, also, javanese, dialects, are, all, mutually, intelligible, a, preliminary, general, classification, of, javanese, dialects, given, by, the, max, planck, institute, for, evolutionary, anthropology, s, department, of, linguistics, is, as, follows, pesisir, tegalan, banyumas, and, tengger, are, considered, to, be, among, the, most, conservative, dialects, the, banten, pesisir, lor, banyumas, and, tengger, dialect, do, not, have, the, vowel, raising, and, vowel, harmony, features, that, are, innovations, of, the, standard, solo, and, yogyakarta, dialects, standard, javanese, is, the, variety, of, the, javanese, language, that, was, developed, at, the, yogyakarta, and, surakarta, courts, the, heirs, to, the, mataram, sultanate, that, once, dominated, the, whole, of, java, and, beyond, based, on, the, central, javanese, dialect, and, becomes, the, basis, for, the, javanese, modern, writings, it, is, marked, with, the, strict, usage, of, two, speech, levels, for, politeness, i, e, vernacular, level, called, ngoko, and, high, register, level, called, krama, other, dialects, do, not, contrast, the, usage, of, the, speech, levels, central, javanese, jawa, tengahan, is, founded, on, the, speech, of, surakarta, and, to, a, lesser, extent, of, yogyakarta, it, is, considered, the, most, refined, of, the, regional, variants, and, serves, as, a, model, for, the, standard, language, this, variant, is, used, throughout, eastern, part, of, central, java, the, special, region, of, yogyakarta, and, the, western, part, of, east, java, provinces, there, are, many, lower, level, dialects, such, as, muria, and, semarangan, as, well, as, surakarta, and, yogyakarta, themselves, javanese, spoken, in, the, madiun, region, along, with, javanese, spoken, in, blitar, ponorogo, pacitan, and, tulungagung, and, central, parts, of, kediri, bears, a, strong, influence, of, surakarta, javanese, the, variations, in, central, java, are, said, to, be, so, plentiful, that, almost, every, administrative, region, or, kabupat, n, has, its, own, local, slang, but, those, minor, dialects, are, not, seen, as, distinct, by, most, javanese, speakers, western, javanese, jawa, kulonan, spoken, in, the, western, part, of, the, central, java, province, and, throughout, the, west, java, and, banten, province, particularly, on, the, north, coast, includes, dialects, that, are, distinct, for, their, sundanese, influences, it, retains, many, archaic, words, and, original, pronunciation, from, old, javanese, some, western, javanese, dialects, such, as, banyumasan, dialects, and, tegal, dialect, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, basa, ngapak, by, other, javanese, because, of, the, dialectal, pronunciation, of, word, apa, what, eastern, javanese, jawa, w, tanan, speakers, range, from, the, eastern, banks, of, brantas, river, in, kertosono, and, from, jombang, to, banyuwangi, comprising, the, second, majority, of, the, east, java, province, excluding, madura, island, situbondo, and, bondowoso, however, some, variant, like, pedalungan, has, been, influenced, by, madurese, the, most, outlying, eastern, javanese, dialect, is, spoken, in, balambangan, or, banyuwangi, it, is, generally, known, as, basa, using, using, a, local, negation, word, is, a, cognate, of, tusing, in, balinese, surinamese, javanese, is, mainly, based, on, central, javanese, especially, from, kedu, residency, the, number, of, speakers, of, suriname, javanese, in, suriname, was, estimated, at, 60, 000, as, of, 2012, most, surinamese, javanese, are, bi, or, trilingual, according, to, the, 2004, census, surinamese, javanese, was, the, first, or, second, language, in, 11, percent, of, households, in, a, 2012, study, of, multilingualism, in, surinamese, education, by, the, dutch, language, union, 3, 497, out, of, 22, 643, pupils, 15, percent, in, primary, education, indicated, surinamese, javanese, as, a, language, spoken, at, home, most, of, them, were, living, in, wanica, and, paramaribo, districts, not, all, immigrants, from, indonesia, to, suriname, were, speakers, of, javanese, immigration, records, show, that, 90, percent, of, immigrants, were, javanese, with, 5, percent, sundanese, 0, 5, percent, madurese, and, 2, 5, percent, from, batavia, the, ethnic, composition, of, this, last, group, was, not, determinable, probably, sundanese, madurese, or, malay, speaking, immigrants, were, forced, to, learn, javanese, during, their, stay, in, suriname, to, adapt, in, view, of, the,
