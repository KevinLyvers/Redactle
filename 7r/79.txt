mining, is, the, extraction, of, valuable, geological, materials, and, minerals, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, mining, is, required, to, obtain, most, materials, that, cannot, be, grown, through, agricultural, processes, or, feasibly, created, artificially, in, a, laboratory, or, factory, ores, recovered, by, mining, include, metals, coal, oil, shale, gemstones, limestone, chalk, dimension, stone, rock, salt, potash, gravel, and, clay, the, ore, must, be, a, rock, or, mineral, that, contains, valuable, constituent, can, be, extracted, or, mined, and, sold, for, profit, mining, in, a, wider, sense, includes, extraction, of, any, non, renewable, resource, such, as, petroleum, natural, gas, or, even, water, modern, mining, processes, involve, prospecting, for, ore, bodies, analysis, of, the, profit, potential, of, a, proposed, mine, extraction, of, the, desired, materials, and, final, reclamation, or, restoration, of, the, land, after, the, mine, is, closed, mining, materials, are, often, obtained, from, ore, bodies, lodes, veins, seams, reefs, or, placer, deposits, the, exploitation, of, these, deposits, for, raw, materials, is, dependent, on, investment, labor, energy, refining, and, transportation, cost, mining, operations, can, create, a, negative, environmental, impact, both, during, the, mining, activity, and, after, the, mine, has, closed, hence, most, of, the, world, s, nations, have, passed, regulations, to, decrease, the, impact, however, the, outsized, role, of, mining, in, generating, business, for, often, rural, remote, or, economically, depressed, communities, means, that, governments, often, fail, to, fully, enforce, such, regulations, work, safety, has, long, been, a, concern, as, well, and, where, enforced, modern, practices, have, significantly, improved, safety, in, mines, unregulated, poorly, regulated, or, illegal, mining, especially, in, developing, economies, frequently, contributes, to, local, human, rights, violations, and, environmental, conflicts, mining, can, also, perpetuate, political, instability, through, resource, conflicts, since, the, beginning, of, civilization, people, have, used, stone, clay, and, later, metals, found, close, to, the, earth, s, surface, these, were, used, to, make, early, tools, and, weapons, for, example, high, quality, flint, found, in, northern, france, southern, england, and, poland, was, used, to, create, flint, tools, flint, mines, have, been, found, in, chalk, areas, where, seams, of, the, stone, were, followed, underground, by, shafts, and, galleries, the, mines, at, grimes, graves, and, krzemionki, are, especially, famous, and, like, most, other, flint, mines, are, neolithic, in, origin, c, 4000, 3000, bc, other, hard, rocks, mined, or, collected, for, axes, included, the, greenstone, of, the, langdale, axe, industry, based, in, the, english, lake, district, the, oldest, known, mine, on, archaeological, record, is, the, ngwenya, mine, in, eswatini, swaziland, which, radiocarbon, dating, shows, to, be, about, 43, 000, years, old, at, this, site, paleolithic, humans, mined, hematite, to, make, the, red, pigment, ochre, mines, of, a, similar, age, in, hungary, are, believed, to, be, sites, where, neanderthals, may, have, mined, flint, for, weapons, and, tools, ancient, egyptians, mined, malachite, at, maadi, at, first, egyptians, used, the, bright, green, malachite, stones, for, ornamentations, and, pottery, later, between, 2613, and, 2494, bc, large, building, projects, required, expeditions, abroad, to, the, area, of, wadi, maghareh, in, order, to, secure, minerals, and, other, resources, not, available, in, egypt, itself, quarries, for, turquoise, and, copper, were, also, found, at, wadi, hammamat, tura, aswan, and, various, other, nubian, sites, on, the, sinai, peninsula, and, at, timna, quarries, for, gypsum, were, found, at, the, umm, el, sawwan, site, gypsum, was, used, to, make, funerary, items, for, private, tombs, other, minerals, mined, in, egypt, from, the, old, kingdom, 2649, 2134, bc, until, the, roman, period, 30, bc, ad, 395, including, granite, sandstone, limestone, basalt, travertine, gneiss, galena, and, amethyst, mining, in, egypt, occurred, in, the, earliest, dynasties, the, gold, mines, of, nubia, were, among, the, largest, and, most, extensive, of, any, in, ancient, egypt, these, mines, are, described, by, the, greek, author, diodorus, siculus, who, mentions, fire, setting, as, one, method, used, to, break, down, the, hard, rock, holding, the, gold, one, of, the, complexes, is, shown, in, one, of, the, earliest, known, mining, maps, the, miners, crushed, the, ore, and, ground, it, to, a, fine, powder, before, washing, the, powder, for, the, gold, dust, known, as, the, dry, and, wet, attachment, processes, mining, in, europe, has, a, very, long, history, examples, include, the, silver, mines, of, laurium, which, helped, support, the, greek, city, state, of, athens, although, they, had, over, 20, 000, slaves, working, them, their, technology, was, essentially, identical, to, their, bronze, age, predecessors, at, other, mines, such, as, on, the, island, of, thassos, marble, was, quarried, by, the, parians, after, they, arrived, in, the, 7th, century, bc, the, marble, was, shipped, away, and, was, later, found, by, archaeologists, to, have, been, used, in, buildings, including, the, tomb, of, amphipolis, philip, ii, of, macedon, the, father, of, alexander, the, great, captured, the, gold, mines, of, mount, pangeo, in, 357, bc, to, fund, his, military, campaigns, he, also, captured, gold, mines, in, thrace, for, minting, coinage, eventually, producing, 26, tons, per, year, however, it, was, the, romans, who, developed, large, scale, mining, methods, especially, the, use, of, large, volumes, of, water, brought, to, the, minehead, by, numerous, aqueducts, the, water, was, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, including, removing, overburden, and, rock, debris, called, hydraulic, mining, as, well, as, washing, comminuted, or, crushed, ores, and, driving, simple, machinery, the, romans, used, hydraulic, mining, methods, on, a, large, scale, to, prospect, for, the, veins, of, ore, especially, using, a, now, obsolete, form, of, mining, known, as, hushing, they, built, numerous, aqueducts, to, supply, water, to, the, minehead, where, the, water, was, stored, in, large, reservoirs, and, tanks, when, a, full, tank, was, opened, the, flood, of, water, sluiced, away, the, overburden, to, expose, the, bedrock, underneath, and, any, gold, bearing, veins, the, rock, was, then, worked, by, fire, setting, to, heat, the, rock, which, would, be, quenched, with, a, stream, of, water, the, resulting, thermal, shock, cracked, the, rock, enabling, it, to, be, removed, by, further, streams, of, water, from, the, overhead, tanks, the, roman, miners, used, similar, methods, to, work, cassiterite, deposits, in, cornwall, and, lead, ore, in, the, pennines, sluicing, methods, were, developed, by, the, romans, in, spain, in, 25, ad, to, exploit, large, alluvial, gold, deposits, the, largest, site, being, at, las, medulas, where, seven, long, aqueducts, tapped, local, rivers, and, sluiced, the, deposits, the, romans, also, exploited, the, silver, present, in, the, argentiferous, galena, in, the, mines, of, cartagena, cartago, nova, linares, castulo, plasenzuela, and, azuaga, among, many, others, spain, was, one, of, the, most, important, mining, regions, but, all, regions, of, the, roman, empire, were, exploited, in, great, britain, the, natives, had, mined, minerals, for, millennia, but, after, the, roman, conquest, the, scale, of, the, operations, increased, dramatically, as, the, romans, needed, britannia, s, resources, especially, gold, silver, tin, and, lead, roman, techniques, were, not, limited, to, surface, mining, they, followed, the, ore, veins, underground, once, opencast, mining, was, no, longer, feasible, at, dolaucothi, they, stoped, out, the, veins, and, drove, adits, through, bare, rock, to, drain, the, stopes, the, same, adits, were, also, used, to, ventilate, the, workings, especially, important, when, fire, setting, was, used, at, other, parts, of, the, site, they, penetrated, the, water, table, and, dewatered, the, mines, using, several, kinds, of, machines, especially, reverse, overshot, water, wheels, these, were, used, extensively, in, the, copper, mines, at, rio, tinto, in, spain, where, one, sequence, comprised, 16, such, wheels, arranged, in, pairs, and, lifting, water, about, 24, metres, 79, ft, they, were, worked, as, treadmills, with, miners, standing, on, the, top, slats, many, examples, of, such, devices, have, been, found, in, old, roman, mines, and, some, examples, are, now, preserved, in, the, british, museum, and, the, national, museum, of, wales, mining, as, an, industry, underwent, dramatic, changes, in, medieval, europe, the, mining, industry, in, the, early, middle, ages, was, mainly, focused, on, the, extraction, of, copper, and, iron, other, precious, metals, were, also, used, mainly, for, gilding, or, coinage, initially, many, metals, were, obtained, through, open, pit, mining, and, ore, was, primarily, extracted, from, shallow, depths, rather, than, through, deep, mine, shafts, around, the, 14th, century, the, growing, use, of, weapons, armour, stirrups, and, horseshoes, greatly, increased, the, demand, for, iron, medieval, knights, for, example, were, often, laden, with, up, to, 100, pounds, 45, kg, of, plate, or, chain, link, armour, in, addition, to, swords, lances, and, other, weapons, the, overwhelming, dependency, on, iron, for, military, purposes, spurred, iron, production, and, extraction, processes, the, silver, crisis, of, 1465, occurred, when, all, mines, had, reached, depths, at, which, the, shafts, could, no, longer, be, pumped, dry, with, the, available, technology, although, an, increased, use, of, banknotes, credit, and, copper, coins, during, this, period, did, decrease, the, value, of, and, dependence, on, precious, metals, gold, and, silver, still, remained, vital, to, the, story, of, medieval, mining, due, to, differences, in, the, social, structure, of, society, the, increasing, extraction, of, mineral, deposits, spread, from, central, europe, to, england, in, the, mid, sixteenth, century, on, the, continent, mineral, deposits, belonged, to, the, crown, and, this, regalian, right, was, stoutly, maintained, but, in, england, royal, mining, rights, were, restricted, to, gold, and, silver, of, which, england, had, virtually, no, deposits, by, a, judicial, decision, of, 1568, and, a, law, in, 1688, england, had, iron, zinc, copper, lead, and, tin, ores, landlords, who, owned, the, base, metals, and, coal, under, their, estates, then, had, a, strong, inducement, to, extract, these, metals, or, to, lease, the, deposits, and, collect, royalties, from, mine, operators, english, german, and, dutch, capital, combined, to, finance, extraction, and, refining, hundreds, of, german, technicians, and, skilled, workers, were, brought, over, in, 1642, a, colony, of, 4, 000, foreigners, was, mining, and, smelting, copper, at, keswick, in, the, northwestern, mountains, use, of, water, power, in, the, form, of, water, mills, was, extensive, the, water, mills, were, employed, in, crushing, ore, raising, ore, from, shafts, and, ventilating, galleries, by, powering, giant, bellows, black, powder, was, first, used, in, mining, in, selmecb, nya, kingdom, of, hungary, now, bansk, tiavnica, slovakia, in, 1627, black, powder, allowed, blasting, of, rock, and, earth, to, loosen, and, reveal, ore, veins, blasting, was, much, faster, than, fire, setting, and, allowed, the, mining, of, previously, impenetrable, metals, and, ores, in, 1762, one, of, the, world, s, first, mining, academies, was, established, in, the, same, town, there, the, widespread, adoption, of, agricultural, innovations, such, as, the, iron, plowshare, as, well, as, the, growing, use, of, metal, as, a, building, material, was, also, a, driving, force, in, the, tremendous, growth, of, the, iron, industry, during, this, period, inventions, like, the, arrastra, were, often, used, by, the, spanish, to, pulverize, ore, after, being, mined, this, device, was, powered, by, animals, and, used, the, same, principles, used, for, grain, threshing, much, of, the, knowledge, of, medieval, mining, techniques, comes, from, books, such, as, biringuccio, s, de, la, pirotechnia, and, probably, most, importantly, from, georg, agricola, s, de, re, metallica, 1556, these, books, detail, many, different, mining, methods, used, in, german, and, saxon, mines, a, prime, issue, in, medieval, mines, which, agricola, explains, in, detail, was, the, removal, of, water, from, mining, shafts, as, miners, dug, deeper, to, access, new, veins, flooding, became, a, very, real, obstacle, the, mining, industry, became, dramatically, more, efficient, and, prosperous, with, the, invention, of, mechanically, and, animal, driven, pumps, iron, metallurgy, in, africa, dates, back, over, four, thousand, years, gold, became, an, important, commodity, for, africa, during, the, trans, saharan, gold, trade, from, the, 7th, century, to, the, 14th, century, gold, was, often, traded, to, mediterranean, economies, that, demanded, gold, and, could, supply, salt, even, though, much, of, africa, was, abundant, with, salt, due, to, the, mines, and, resources, in, the, sahara, desert, the, trading, of, gold, for, salt, was, mostly, used, to, promote, trade, between, the, different, economies, since, the, great, trek, in, the, 19th, century, after, gold, and, diamond, mining, in, southern, africa, has, had, major, political, and, economic, impacts, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, is, the, largest, producer, of, diamonds, in, africa, with, an, estimated, 12, million, carats, in, 2019, other, types, of, mining, reserves, in, africa, include, cobalt, bauxite, iron, ore, coal, and, copper, gold, and, coal, mining, started, in, australia, and, new, zealand, in, the, 19th, century, nickel, has, become, important, in, the, economy, of, new, caledonia, in, fiji, in, 1934, the, emperor, gold, mining, company, ltd, established, operations, at, vatukoula, followed, in, 1935, by, the, loloma, gold, mines, n, l, and, then, by, fiji, mines, development, ltd, aka, dolphin, mines, ltd, these, developments, ushered, in, a, mining, boom, with, gold, production, rising, more, than, a, hundred, fold, from, 931, 4, oz, in, 1934, to, 107, 788, 5, oz, in, 1939, an, order, of, magnitude, then, comparable, to, the, combined, output, of, new, zealand, and, australia, s, eastern, states, during, prehistoric, times, early, americans, mined, large, amounts, of, copper, along, lake, superior, s, keweenaw, peninsula, and, in, nearby, isle, royale, metallic, copper, was, still, present, near, the, surface, in, colonial, times, indigenous, peoples, used, lake, superior, copper, from, at, least, 5, 000, years, ago, copper, tools, arrowheads, and, other, artifacts, that, were, part, of, an, extensive, native, trade, network, have, been, discovered, in, addition, obsidian, flint, and, other, minerals, were, mined, worked, and, traded, early, french, explorers, who, encountered, the, sites, made, no, use, of, the, metals, due, to, the, difficulties, of, transporting, them, but, the, copper, was, eventually, traded, throughout, the, continent, along, major, river, routes, in, the, early, colonial, history, of, the, americas, native, gold, and, silver, was, quickly, expropriated, and, sent, back, to, spain, in, fleets, of, gold, and, silver, laden, galleons, the, gold, and, silver, originating, mostly, from, mines, in, central, and, south, america, turquoise, dated, at, 700, ad, was, mined, in, pre, columbian, america, in, the, cerillos, mining, district, in, new, mexico, an, estimate, of, about, 15, 000, tons, of, rock, had, been, removed, from, mt, chalchihuitl, using, stone, tools, before, 1700, in, 1727, louis, denys, denis, 1675, 1741, sieur, de, la, ronde, brother, of, simon, pierre, denys, de, bonaventure, and, the, son, in, law, of, ren, chartier, took, command, of, fort, la, pointe, at, chequamegon, bay, where, natives, informed, him, of, an, island, of, copper, la, ronde, obtained, permission, from, the, french, crown, to, operate, mines, in, 1733, becoming, the, first, practical, miner, on, lake, superior, seven, years, later, mining, was, halted, by, an, outbreak, between, sioux, and, chippewa, tribes, mining, in, the, united, states, became, widespread, in, the, 19th, century, and, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, general, mining, act, of, 1872, to, encourage, mining, of, federal, lands, as, with, the, california, gold, rush, in, the, mid, 19th, century, mining, for, minerals, and, precious, metals, along, with, ranching, became, a, driving, factor, in, the, u, s, westward, expansion, to, the, pacific, coast, with, the, exploration, of, the, west, mining, camps, sprang, up, and, expressed, a, distinctive, spirit, an, enduring, legacy, to, the, new, nation, gold, rushers, would, experience, the, same, problems, as, the, land, rushers, of, the, transient, west, that, preceded, them, aided, by, railroads, many, people, traveled, west, for, work, opportunities, in, mining, western, cities, such, as, denver, and, sacramento, originated, as, mining, towns, when, new, areas, were, explored, it, was, usually, the, gold, placer, and, then, lode, and, then, silver, that, were, taken, into, possession, and, extracted, first, other, metals, would, often, wait, for, railroads, or, canals, as, coarse, gold, dust, and, nuggets, do, not, require, smelting, and, are, easy, to, identify, and, transport, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, gold, and, silver, rush, to, the, western, united, states, also, stimulated, mining, for, coal, as, well, as, base, metals, such, as, copper, lead, and, iron, areas, in, modern, montana, utah, arizona, and, later, alaska, became, predominate, suppliers, of, copper, to, the, world, which, was, increasingly, demanding, copper, for, electrical, and, households, goods, canada, s, mining, industry, grew, more, slowly, than, did, the, united, states, due, to, limitations, in, transportation, capital, and, u, s, competition, ontario, was, the, major, producer, of, the, early, 20th, century, with, nickel, copper, and, gold, meanwhile, australia, experienced, the, australian, gold, rushes, and, by, the, 1850s, was, producing, 40, of, the, world, s, gold, followed, by, the, establishment, of, large, mines, such, as, the, mount, morgan, mine, which, ran, for, nearly, a, hundred, years, broken, hill, ore, deposit, one, of, the, largest, zinc, lead, ore, deposits, and, the, iron, ore, mines, at, iron, knob, after, declines, in, production, another, boom, in, mining, occurred, in, the, 1960s, now, in, the, early, 21st, century, australia, remains, a, major, world, mineral, producer, as, the, 21st, century, begins, a, globalized, mining, industry, of, large, multinational, corporations, has, arisen, peak, minerals, and, environmental, impacts, have, also, become, a, concern, different, elements, particularly, rare, earth, minerals, have, begun, to, increase, in, demand, as, a, result, of, new, technologies, the, process, of, mining, from, discovery, of, an, ore, body, through, extraction, of, minerals, and, finally, to, returning, the, land, to, its, natural, state, consists, of, several, distinct, steps, the, first, is, discovery, of, the, ore, body, which, is, carried, out, through, prospecting, or, exploration, to, find, and, then, define, the, extent, location, and, value, of, the, ore, body, this, leads, to, a, mathematical, resource, estimation, to, estimate, the, size, and, grade, of, the, deposit, this, estimation, is, used, to, conduct, a, pre, feasibility, study, to, determine, the, theoretical, economics, of, the, ore, deposit, this, identifies, early, on, whether, further, investment, in, estimation, and, engineering, studies, is, warranted, and, identifies, key, risks, and, areas, for, further, work, the, next, step, is, to, conduct, a, feasibility, study, to, evaluate, the, financial, viability, the, technical, and, financial, risks, and, the, robustness, of, the, project, this, is, when, the, mining, company, makes, the, decision, whether, to, develop, the, mine, or, to, walk, away, from, the, project, this, includes, mine, planning, to, evaluate, the, economically, recoverable, portion, of, the, deposit, the, metallurgy, and, ore, recoverability, marketability, and, payability, of, the, ore, concentrates, engineering, concerns, milling, and, infrastructure, costs, finance, and, equity, requirements, and, an, analysis, of, the, proposed, mine, from, the, initial, excavation, all, the, way, through, to, reclamation, the, proportion, of, a, deposit, that, is, economically, recoverable, is, dependent, on, the, enrichment, factor, of, the, ore, in, the, area, to, gain, access, to, the, mineral, deposit, within, an, area, it, is, often, necessary, to, mine, through, or, remove, waste, material, which, is, not, of, immediate, interest, to, the, miner, the, total, movement, of, ore, and, waste, constitutes, the, mining, process, often, more, waste, than, ore, is, mined, during, the, life, of, a, mine, depending, on, the, nature, and, location, of, the, ore, body, waste, removal, and, placement, is, a, major, cost, to, the, mining, operator, so, a, detailed, characterization, of, the, waste, material, forms, an, essential, part, of, the, geological, exploration, program, for, a, mining, operation, once, the, analysis, determines, a, given, ore, body, is, worth, recovering, development, begins, to, create, access, to, the, ore, body, the, mine, buildings, and, processing, plants, are, built, and, any, necessary, equipment, is, obtained, the, operation, of, the, mine, to, recover, the, ore, begins, and, continues, as, long, as, the, company, operating, the, mine, finds, it, economical, to, do, so, once, all, the, ore, that, the, mine, can, produce, profitably, is, recovered, reclamation, can, begin, to, make, the, land, used, by, the, mine, suitable, for, future, use, technical, and, economic, challenges, notwithstanding, successful, mine, development, must, also, address, human, factors, working, conditions, are, paramount, to, success, especially, with, regard, to, exposures, to, dusts, radiation, noise, explosives, hazards, and, vibration, as, well, as, illumination, standards, mining, today, increasingly, must, address, environmental, and, community, impacts, including, psychological, and, sociological, dimensions, thus, mining, educator, frank, t, m, white, 1909, 1971, broadened, the, focus, to, the, total, environment, of, mining, including, reference, to, community, development, around, mining, and, how, mining, is, portrayed, to, an, urban, society, which, depends, on, the, industry, although, seemingly, unaware, of, this, dependency, he, stated, n, the, past, mining, engineers, have, not, been, called, upon, to, study, the, psychological, sociological, and, personal, problems, of, their, own, industry, aspects, that, nowadays, are, assuming, tremendous, importance, the, mining, engineer, must, rapidly, expand, his, knowledge, and, his, influence, into, these, newer, fields, mining, techniques, can, be, divided, into, two, common, excavation, types, surface, mining, and, sub, surface, underground, mining, today, surface, mining, is, much, more, common, and, produces, for, example, 85, of, minerals, excluding, petroleum, and, natural, gas, in, the, united, states, including, 98, of, metallic, ores, targets, are, divided, into, two, general, categories, of, materials, placer, deposits, consisting, of, valuable, minerals, contained, within, river, gravels, beach, sands, and, other, unconsolidated, materials, and, lode, deposits, where, valuable, minerals, are, found, in, veins, in, layers, or, in, mineral, grains, generally, distributed, throughout, a, mass, of, actual, rock, both, types, of, ore, deposit, placer, or, lode, are, mined, by, both, surface, and, underground, methods, some, mining, including, much, of, the, rare, earth, elements, and, uranium, mining, is, done, by, less, common, methods, such, as, in, situ, leaching, this, technique, involves, digging, neither, at, the, surface, nor, underground, the, extraction, of, target, minerals, by, this, technique, requires, that, they, be, soluble, e, g, potash, potassium, chloride, sodium, chloride, sodium, sulfate, which, dissolve, in, water, some, minerals, such, as, copper, minerals, and, uranium, oxide, require, acid, or, carbonate, solutions, to, dissolve, explosives, in, mining, explosives, have, been, used, in, surface, mining, and, sub, surface, mining, to, blast, out, rock, and, ore, intended, for, processing, the, most, common, explosive, used, in, mining, is, ammonium, nitrate, between, 1870, and, 1920, in, queensland, australia, an, increase, in, mining, accidents, lead, to, more, safety, measures, surrounding, the, use, of, explosives, for, mining, in, the, united, states, of, america, between, 1990, and, 1999, about, 22, 3, billion, kilograms, of, explosives, were, used, in, mining, quarrying, and, other, industries, moreover, coal, mining, used, 66, 4, nonmetal, mining, and, quarrying, 13, 5, metal, mining, 10, 4, construction, 7, 1, and, all, other, users, 2, 6, artisanal, and, small, scale, mining, asm, is, a, blanket, term, for, a, type, of, subsistence, mining, involving, a, miner, who, may, or, may, not, be, officially, employed, by, a, mining, company, but, works, independently, mining, minerals, using, their, own, resources, usually, by, hand, while, there, is, no, completely, coherent, definition, for, asm, artisanal, mining, generally, includes, miners, who, are, not, officially, employed, by, a, mining, company, and, use, their, own, resources, to, mine, as, such, they, are, part, of, an, informal, economy, asm, also, includes, in, small, scale, mining, enterprises, or, individuals, that, employ, workers, for, mining, but, who, generally, still, use, similar, manually, intensive, methods, as, artisanal, miners, such, as, working, with, hand, tools, in, addition, asm, can, be, characterized, as, distinct, from, large, scale, mining, lsm, by, less, efficient, extraction, of, pure, minerals, from, the, ore, lower, wages, decreased, occupational, safety, benefits, and, health, standards, for, miners, and, a, lack, of, environmental, protection, measures, artisanal, miners, often, undertake, the, activity, of, mining, seasonally, for, example, crops, are, planted, in, the, rainy, season, and, mining, is, pursued, in, the, dry, season, however, they, also, frequently, travel, to, mining, areas, and, work, year, round, there, are, four, broad, types, of, asm, surface, mining, is, done, by, removing, surface, vegetation, dirt, and, bedrock, to, reach, buried, ore, deposits, techniques, of, surface, mining, include, open, pit, mining, which, is, the, recovery, of, materials, from, an, open, pit, in, the, ground, quarrying, identical, to, open, pit, mining, except, that, it, refers, to, sand, stone, and, clay, strip, mining, which, consists, of, stripping, surface, layers, off, to, reveal, ore, underneath, and, mountaintop, removal, commonly, associated, with, coal, mining, which, involves, taking, the, top, of, a, mountain, off, to, reach, ore, deposits, at, depth, most, placer, deposits, because, they, are, shallowly, buried, are, mined, by, surface, methods, finally, landfill, mining, involves, sites, where, landfills, are, excavated, and, processed, landfill, mining, has, been, thought, of, as, a, long, term, solution, to, methane, emissions, and, local, pollution, high, wall, mining, which, evolved, from, auger, mining, is, another, form, of, surface, mining, in, high, wall, mining, the, remaining, part, of, a, coal, seam, previously, exploited, by, other, surface, mining, techniques, has, too, much, overburden, to, be, removed, but, can, still, be, profitably, exploited, from, the, side, of, the, artificial, cliff, made, by, previous, mining, a, typical, cycle, alternates, sumping, which, undercuts, the, seam, and, shearing, which, raises, and, lowers, the, cutter, head, boom, to, cut, the, entire, height, of, the, coal, seam, as, the, coal, recovery, cycle, continues, the, cutter, head, is, progressively, launched, further, into, the, coal, seam, high, wall, mining, can, produce, thousands, of, tons, of, coal, in, contour, strip, operations, with, narrow, benches, previously, mined, areas, trench, mine, applications, and, steep, dip, seams, sub, surface, mining, consists, of, digging, tunnels, or, shafts, into, the, earth, to, reach, buried, ore, deposits, ore, for, processing, and, waste, rock, for, disposal, are, brought, to, the, surface, through, the, tunnels, and, shafts, sub, surface, mining, can, be, classified, by, the, type, of, access, shafts, used, and, the, extraction, method, or, the, technique, used, to, reach, the, mineral, deposit, drift, mining, uses, horizontal, access, tunnels, slope, mining, uses, diagonally, sloping, access, shafts, and, shaft, mining, uses, vertical, access, shafts, mining, in, hard, and, soft, rock, formations, requires, different, techniques, other, methods, include, shrinkage, stope, mining, which, is, mining, upward, creating, a, sloping, underground, room, long, wall, mining, which, is, grinding, a, long, ore, surface, underground, and, room, and, pillar, mining, which, is, removing, ore, from, rooms, while, leaving, pillars, in, place, to, support, the, roof, of, the, room, room, and, pillar, mining, often, leads, to, retreat, mining, in, which, supporting, pillars, are, removed, as, miners, retreat, allowing, the, room, to, cave, in, thereby, loosening, more, ore, additional, sub, surface, mining, methods, include, hard, rock, mining, bore, hole, mining, drift, and, fill, mining, long, hole, slope, mining, sub, level, caving, and, block, caving, heavy, machinery, is, used, in, mining, to, explore, and, develop, sites, to, remove, and, stockpile, overburden, to, break, and, remove, rocks, of, various, hardness, and, toughness, to, process, the, ore, and, to, carry, out, reclamation, projects, after, the, mine, is, closed, bulldozers, drills, explosives, and, trucks, are, all, necessary, for, excavating, the, land, in, the, case, of, placer, mining, unconsolidated, gravel, or, alluvium, is, fed, into, machinery, consisting, of, a, hopper, and, a, shaking, screen, or, trommel, which, frees, the, desired, minerals, from, the, waste, gravel, the, minerals, are, then, concentrated, using, sluices, or, jigs, large, drills, are, used, to, sink, shafts, excavate, stopes, and, obtain, samples, for, analysis, trams, are, used, to, transport, miners, minerals, and, waste, lifts, carry, miners, into, and, out, of, mines, and, move, rock, and, ore, out, and, machinery, in, and, out, of, underground, mines, huge, trucks, shovels, and, cranes, are, employed, in, surface, mining, to, move, large, quantities, of, overburden, and, ore, processing, plants, use, large, crushers, mills, reactors, roasters, and, other, equipment, to, consolidate, the, mineral, rich, material, and, extract, the, desired, compounds, and, metals, from, the, ore, once, the, mineral, is, extracted, it, is, often, then, processed, the, science, of, extractive, metallurgy, is, a, specialized, area, in, the, science, of, metallurgy, that, studies, the, extraction, of, valuable, metals, from, their, ores, especially, through, chemical, or, mechanical, means, mineral, processing, or, mineral, dressing, is, a, specialized, area, in, the, science, of, metallurgy, that, studies, the, mechanical, means, of, crushing, grinding, and, washing, that, enable, the, separation, extractive, metallurgy, of, valuable, metals, or, minerals, from, their, gangue, waste, material, processing, of, placer, ore, material, consists, of, gravity, dependent, methods, of, separation, such, as, sluice, boxes, only, minor, shaking, or, washing, may, be, necessary, to, disaggregate, unclump, the, sands, or, gravels, before, processing, processing, of, ore, from, a, lode, mine, whether, it, is, a, surface, or, subsurface, mine, requires, that, the, rock, ore, be, crushed, and, pulverized, before, extraction, of, the, valuable, minerals, begins, after, lode, ore, is, crushed, recovery, of, the, valuable, minerals, is, done, by, one, or, a, combination, of, several, mechanical, and, chemical, techniques, since, most, metals, are, present, in, ores, as, oxides, or, sulfides, the, metal, needs, to, be, reduced, to, its, metallic, form, this, can, be, accomplished, through, chemical, means, such, as, smelting, or, through, electrolytic, reduction, as, in, the, case, of, aluminium, geometallurgy, combines, the, geologic, sciences, with, extractive, metallurgy, and, mining, in, 2018, led, by, chemistry, and, biochemistry, professor, bradley, d, smith, university, of, notre, dame, researchers, invented, a, new, class, of, molecules, whose, shape, and, size, enable, them, to, capture, and, contain, precious, metal, ions, reported, in, a, study, published, by, the, journal, of, the, american, chemical, society, the, new, method, converts, gold, containing, ore, into, chloroauric, acid, and, extracts, it, using, an, industrial, solvent, the, container, molecules, are, able, to, selectively, separate, the, gold, from, the, solvent, without, the, use, of, water, stripping, the, newly, developed, molecules, can, eliminate, water, stripping, whereas, mining, traditionally, relies, on, a, 125, year, old, method, that, treats, gold, containing, ore, with, large, quantities, of, poisonous, sodium, cyanide, this, new, process, has, a, milder, environmental, impact, and, that, besides, gold, it, can, be, used, for, capturing, other, metals, such, as, platinum, and, palladium, and, could, also, be, used, in, urban, mining, processes, that, remove, precious, metals, from, wastewater, streams, environmental, impact, of, mining, can, occur, at, local, regional, and, global, scales, through, direct, and, indirect, mining, practices, mining, can, cause, erosion, sinkholes, loss, of, biodiversity, or, the, contamination, of, soil, groundwater, and, surface, water, by, chemicals, emitted, from, mining, processes, these, processes, also, affect, the, atmosphere, through, carbon, emissions, which, contributes, to, climate, change, some, mining, methods, lithium, mining, phosphate, mining, coal, mining, mountaintop, removal, mining, and, sand, mining, may, have, such, significant, environmental, and, public, health, effects, that, mining, companies, in, some, countries, are, required, to, follow, strict, environmental, and, rehabilitation, codes, to, ensure, that, the, mined, area, returns, to, its, original, state, mining, can, provide, various, advantages, to, societies, yet, it, can, also, spark, conflicts, particularly, regarding, land, use, both, above, and, below, the, surface, mining, operations, remain, rigorous, and, intrusive, often, resulting, in, significant, environmental, impacts, on, local, ecosystems, and, broader, implications, for, planetary, environmental, health, to, accommodate, mines, and, associated, infrastructure, land, is, cleared, extensively, consuming, significant, energy, and, water, resources, emitting, air, pollutants, and, producing, hazardous, waste, countries, with, strongly, enforced, mining, regulations, commonly, require, environmental, impact, assessment, development, of, environmental, management, plans, and, mine, closure, planning, prior, beginning, mine, operations, environmental, monitoring, during, operation, and, after, closure, may, also, be, required, government, regulations, may, not, be, well, enforced, especially, in, the, developing, world, for, major, mining, companies, and, any, company, seeking, international, financing, there, are, a, number, of, other, mechanisms, to, enforce, environmental, standards, these, generally, relate, to, financing, standards, such, as, the, equator, principles, ifc, environmental, standards, and, criteria, for, socially, responsible, investing, mining, companies, have, used, this, oversight, from, the, financial, sector, to, argue, for, some, level, of, industry, self, regulation, in, 1992, a, draft, code, of, conduct, for, transnational, corporations, was, proposed, at, the, rio, earth, summit, by, the, un, centre, for, transnational, corporations, unctc, but, the, business, council, for, sustainable, development, bcsd, together, with, the, international, chamber, of, commerce, icc, argued, successfully, for, self, regulation, instead, this, was, followed, by, the, global, mining, initiative, which, was, begun, by, nine, of, the, largest, metals, and, mining, companies, and, which, led, to, the, formation, of, the, international, council, on, mining, and, metals, whose, purpose, was, to, act, as, a, catalyst, in, an, effort, to, improve, social, and, environmental, performance, in, the, mining, and, metals, industry, internationally, the, mining, industry, has, provided, funding, to, various, conservation, groups, some, of, which, have, been, working, with, conservation, agendas, that, are, at, odds, with, an, emerging, acceptance, of, the, rights, of, indigenous, people, particularly, the, right, to, make, land, use, decisions, certification, of, mines, with, good, practices, occurs, through, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, for, example, iso, 9000, and, iso, 14001, which, certify, an, auditable, environmental, management, system, involve, short, inspections, although, they, have, been, accused, of, lacking, rigor, 183, 84, certification, is, also, available, through, ceres, global, reporting, initiative, but, these, reports, are, voluntary, and, unverified, miscellaneous, other, certification, programs, exist, for, various, projects, typically, through, nonprofit, groups, 185, 86, the, purpose, of, a, 2012, eps, peaks, paper, was, to, provide, evidence, on, policies, managing, ecological, costs, and, maximize, socio, economic, benefits, of, mining, using, host, country, regulatory, initiatives, it, found, existing, literature, suggesting, donors, encourage, developing, countries, to, ore, mills, generate, large, amounts, of, waste, called, tailings, for, example, 99, tons, of, waste, is, generated, per, ton, of, copper, with, even, higher, ratios, in, gold, mining, because, only, 5, 3, g, of, gold, is, extracted, per, ton, of, ore, a, ton, of, gold, produces, 200, 000, tons, of, tailings, as, time, goes, on, and, richer, deposits, are, exhausted, and, technology, improves, this, number, is, going, down, to, 5, g, and, less, these, tailings, can, be, toxic, tailings, which, are, usually, produced, as, a, slurry, are, most, commonly, dumped, into, ponds, made, from, naturally, existing, valleys, these, ponds, are, secured, by, impoundments, dams, or, embankment, dams, in, 2000, it, was, estimated, that, 3, 500, tailings, impoundments, existed, and, that, every, year, 2, to, 5, major, failures, and, 35, minor, failures, occurred, for, example, in, the, marcopper, mining, disaster, at, least, 2, million, tons, of, tailings, were, released, into, a, local, river, in, 2015, barrick, gold, corporation, spilled, over, 1, million, liters, of, cyanide, into, a, total, of, five, rivers, in, argentina, near, their, veladero, mine, since, 2007, in, central, finland, the, talvivaara, terrafame, polymetal, mine, s, waste, effluent, and, leaks, of, saline, mine, water, have, resulted, in, ecological, collapse, of, a, nearby, lake, subaqueous, tailings, disposal, is, another, option, the, mining, industry, has, argued, that, submarine, tailings, disposal, std, which, disposes, of, tailings, in, the, sea, is, ideal, because, it, avoids, the, risks, of, tailings, ponds, the, practice, is, illegal, in, the, united, states, and, canada, but, it, is, used, in, the, developing, world, the, waste, is, classified, as, either, sterile, or, mineralized, with, acid, generating, potential, and, the, movement, and, storage, of, this, material, form, a, major, part, of, the, mine, planning, process, when, the, mineralised, package, is, determined, by, an, economic, cut, off, the, near, grade, mineralised, waste, is, usually, dumped, separately, with, view, to, later, treatment, should, market, conditions, change, and, it, becomes, economically, viable, civil, engineering, design, parameters, are, used, in, the, design, of, the, waste, dumps, and, special, conditions, apply, to, high, rainfall, areas, and, to, seismically, active, areas, waste, dump, designs, must, meet, all, regulatory, requirements, of, the, country, in, whose, jurisdiction, the, mine, is, located, it, is, also, common, practice, to, rehabilitate, dumps, to, an, internationally, acceptable, standard, which, in, some, cases, means, that, higher, standards, than, the, local, regulatory, standard, are, applied, mining, exists, in, many, countries, london, is, the, headquarters, for, large, miners, such, as, anglo, american, bhp, and, rio, tinto, the, us, mining, industry, is, also, large, but, it, is, dominated, by, extraction, of, coal, and, other, nonmetal, minerals, e, g, rock, and, sand, and, various, regulations, have, worked, to, reduce, the, significance, of, mining, in, the, united, states, in, 2007, the, total, market, capitalization, of, mining, companies, was, reported, at, us, 962, billion, which, compares, to, a, total, global, market, cap, of, publicly, traded, companies, of, about, us, 50, trillion, in, 2007, in, 2002, chile, and, peru, were, reportedly, the, major, mining, countries, of, south, america, the, mineral, industry, of, africa, includes, the, mining, of, various, minerals, it, produces, relatively, little, of, the, industrial, metals, copper, lead, and, zinc, but, according, to, one, estimate, has, as, a, percent, of, world, reserves, 40, of, gold, 60, of, cobalt, and, 90, of, the, world, s, platinum, group, metals, mining, in, india, is, a, significant, part, of, that, country, s, economy, in, the, developed, world, mining, in, australia, with, bhp, founded, and, headquartered, in, the, country, and, mining, in, canada, are, particularly, significant, for, rare, earth, minerals, mining, china, reportedly, controlled, 95, of, production, in, 2013, while, exploration, and, mining, can, be, conducted, by, individual, entrepreneurs, or, small, businesses, most, modern, day, mines, are, large, enterprises, requiring, large, amounts, of, capital, to, establish, consequently, the, mining, sector, of, the, industry, is, dominated, by, large, often, multinational, companies, most, of, them, publicly, listed, it, can, be, argued, that, what, is, referred, to, as, the, mining, industry, is, actually, two, sectors, one, specializing, in, exploration, for, new, resources, and, the, other, in, mining, those, resources, the, exploration, sector, is, typically, made, up, of, individuals, and, small, mineral, resource, companies, called, juniors, which, are, dependent, on, venture, capital, the, mining, sector, is, made, up, of, large, multinational, companies, that, are, sustained, by, production, from, their, mining, operations, various, other, industries, such, as, equipment, manufacture, environmental, testing, and, metallurgy, analysis, rely, on, and, support, the, mining, industry, throughout, the, world, canadian, stock, exchanges, have, a, particular, focus, on, mining, companies, particularly, junior, exploration, companies, through, toronto, s, tsx, venture, exchange, canadian, companies, raise, capital, on, these, exchanges, and, then, invest, the, money, in, exploration, globally, some, have, argued, that, below, juniors, there, exists, a, substantial, sector, of, illegitimate, companies, primarily, focused, on, manipulating, stock, prices, mining, operations, can, be, grouped, into, five, major, categories, in, terms, of, their, respective, resources, these, are, oil, and, gas, extraction, coal, mining, metal, ore, mining, nonmetallic, mineral, mining, and, quarrying, and, mining, support, activities, of, all, of, these, categories, oil, and, gas, extraction, remains, one, of, the, largest, in, terms, of, its, global, economic, importance, prospecting, potential, mining, sites, a, vital, area, of, concern, for, the, mining, industry, is, now, done, using, sophisticated, new, technologies, such, as, seismic, prospecting, and, remote, sensing, satellites, mining, is, heavily, affected, by, the, prices, of, the, commodity, minerals, which, are, often, volatile, the, 2000s, commodities, boom, commodities, supercycle, increased, the, prices, of, commodities, driving, aggressive, mining, in, addition, the, price, of, gold, increased, dramatically, in, the, 2000s, which, increased, gold, mining, for, example, one, study, found, that, conversion, of, forest, in, the, amazon, increased, six, fold, from, the, period, 2003, 2006, 292, ha, yr, to, the, period, 2006, 2009, 1, 915, ha, yr, largely, due, to, artisanal, mining, mining, companies, can, be, classified, based, on, their, size, and, financial, capabilities, re, their, valuation, and, stock, market, characteristics, see, valuation, finance, valuation, of, mining, projects, new, regulations, and, a, process, of, legislative, reforms, aim, to, improve, the, harmonization, and, stability, of, the, mining, sector, in, mineral, rich, countries, new, legislation, for, mining, industry, in, african, countries, still, appears, to, be, an, issue, but, has, the, potential, to, be, solved, when, a, consensus, is, reached, on, the, best, approach, by, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, the, booming, and, increasingly, complex, mining, sector, in, mineral, rich, countries, was, providing, only, slight, benefits, to, local, communities, especially, in, given, the, sustainability, issues, increasing, debate, and, influence, by, ngos, and, local, communities, called, for, new, approaches, which, would, also, include, disadvantaged, communities, and, work, towards, sustainable, development, even, after, mine, closure, including, transparency, and, revenue, management, by, the, early, 2000s, community, development, issues, and, resettlements, became, mainstream, concerns, in, world, bank, mining, projects, mining, industry, expansion, after, mineral, prices, increased, in, 2003, and, also, potential, fiscal, revenues, in, those, countries, created, an, omission, in, the, other, economic, sectors, in, terms, of, finances, and, development, furthermore, this, highlighted, regional, and, local, demand, for, mining, revenues, and, an, inability, of, sub, national, governments, to, effectively, use, the, revenues, the, fraser, institute, a, canadian, think, tank, has, highlighted, the, environmental, protection, laws, in, developing, countries, as, well, as, voluntary, efforts, by, mining, companies, to, improve, their, environmental, impact, in, 2007, the, extractive, industries, transparency, initiative, eiti, was, mainstreamed, in, all, countries, cooperating, with, the, world, bank, in, mining, industry, reform, the, eiti, operates, and, was, implemented, with, the, support, of, the, eiti, multi, donor, trust, fund, managed, by, the, world, bank, the, eiti, aims, to, increase, transparency, in, transactions, between, governments, and, companies, in, extractive, industries, by, monitoring, the, revenues, and, benefits, between, industries, and, recipient, governments, the, entrance, process, is, voluntary, for, each, country, and, is, monitored, by, multiple, stakeholders, including, governments, private, companies, and, civil, society, representatives, responsible, for, disclosure, and, dissemination, of, the, reconciliation, report, however, the, competitive, disadvantage, of, company, by, company, public, report, is, for, some, of, the, businesses, in, ghana, at, least, the, main, constraint, therefore, the, outcome, assessment, in, terms, of, failure, or, success, of, the, new, eiti, regulation, does, not, only, rest, on, the, government, s, shoulders, but, also, on, civil, society, and, companies, however, implementation, has, issues, inclusion, or, exclusion, of, artisanal, mining, and, small, scale, mining, asm, from, the, eiti, and, how, to, deal, with, non, cash, payments, made, by, companies, to, subnational, governments, furthermore, the, disproportionate, revenues, the, mining, industry, can, bring, to, the, comparatively, small, number, of, people, that, it, employs, causes, other, problems, like, a, lack, of, investment, in, other, less, lucrative, sectors, leading, to, swings, in, government, revenue, because, of, volatility, in, the, oil, markets, artisanal, mining, is, clearly, an, issue, in, eiti, countries, such, as, the, central, african, republic, d, r, congo, guinea, liberia, and, sierra, leone, i, e, almost, half, of, the, mining, countries, implementing, the, eiti, among, other, things, limited, scope, of, the, eiti, involving, disparity, in, terms, of, knowledge, of, the, industry, and, negotiation, skills, thus, far, flexibility, of, the, policy, e, g, liberty, of, the, countries, to, expand, beyond, the, minimum, requirements, and, adapt, it, to, their, needs, creates, another, risk, of, unsuccessful, implementation, public, awareness, increase, where, government, should, act, as, a, bridge, between, public, and, initiative, for, a, successful, outcome, of, the, policy, is, an, important, element, to, be, considered, the, world, bank, has, been, involved, in, mining, since, 1955, mainly, through, grants, from, its, international, bank, for, reconstruction, and, development, with, the, bank, s, multilateral, investment, guarantee, agency, offering, political, risk, insurance, between, 1955, and, 1990, it, provided, about, 2, billion, to, fifty, mining, projects, broadly, categorized, as, reform, and, rehabilitation, greenfield, mine, construction, mineral, processing, technical, assistance, and, engineering, these, projects, have, been, criticized, particularly, the, ferro, carajas, project, of, brazil, begun, in, 1981, the, world, bank, established, mining, codes, intended, to, increase, foreign, investment, in, 1988, it, solicited, feedback, from, 45, mining, companies, on, how, to, increase, their, involvement, 20, in, 1992, the, world, bank, began, to, push, for, privatization, of, government, owned, mining, companies, with, a, new, set, of, codes, beginning, with, its, report, the, strategy, for, african, mining, in, 1997, latin, america, s, largest, miner, companhia, vale, do, rio, doce, cvrd, was, privatized, these, and, other, developments, such, as, the, philippines, 1995, mining, act, led, the, bank, to, publish, a, third, report, assistance, for, minerals, sector, development, and, reform, in, member, countries, which, endorsed, mandatory, environment, impact, assessments, and, attention, to, the, concerns, of, the, local, population, the, codes, based, on, this, report, are, influential, in, the, legislation, of, developing, nations, the, new, codes, are, intended, to, encourage, development, through, tax, holidays, zero, custom, duties, reduced, income, taxes, and, related, measures, 22, the, results, of, these, codes, were, analyzed, by, a, group, from, the, university, of, quebec, which, concluded, that, the, codes, promote, foreign, investment, but, fall, very, short, of, permitting, sustainable, development, the, observed, negative, correlation, between, natural, resources, and, economic, development, is, known, as, the, resource, curse, safety, has, long, been, a, concern, in, the, mining, business, especially, in, sub, surface, mining, the, courri, res, mine, disaster, europe, s, worst, mining, accident, involved, the, death, of, 1, 099, miners, in, northern, france, on, march, 10, 1906, this, disaster, was, surpassed, only, by, the, benxihu, colliery, accident, in, china, on, april, 26, 1942, which, killed, 1, 549, miners, while, mining, today, is, substantially, safer, than, it, was, in, previous, decades, mining, accidents, still, occur, government, figures, indicate, that, 5, 000, chinese, miners, die, in, accidents, each, year, while, other, reports, have, suggested, a, figure, as, high, as, 20, 000, between, 1870, and, 1920, in, queensland, australia, an, increase, in, mining, accidents, lead, to, more, safety, measures, surrounding, the, use, of, explosives, for, mining, mining, accidents, continue, worldwide, including, accidents, causing, dozens, of, fatalities, at, a, time, such, as, the, 2007, ulyanovskaya, mine, disaster, in, russia, the, 2009, heilongjiang, mine, explosion, in, china, and, the, 2010, upper, big, branch, mine, disaster, in, the, united, states, mining, has, been, identified, by, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, as, a, priority, industry, sector, in, the, national, occupational, research, agenda, nora, to, identify, and, provide, intervention, strategies, regarding, occupational, health, and, safety, issues, the, mining, safety, and, health, administration, msha, was, established, in, 1978, to, work, to, prevent, death, illness, and, injury, from, mining, and, promote, safe, and, healthful, workplaces, for, us, miners, since, its, implementation, in, 1978, the, number, of, miner, fatalities, has, decreased, from, 242, miners, in, 1978, to, 24, miners, in, 2019, there, are, numerous, occupational, hazards, associated, with, mining, including, exposure, to, rockdust, which, can, lead, to, diseases, such, as, silicosis, asbestosis, and, pneumoconiosis, gases, in, the, mine, can, lead, to, asphyxiation, and, could, also, be, ignited, mining, equipment, can, generate, considerable, noise, putting, workers, at, risk, for, hearing, loss, cave, ins, rock, falls, and, exposure, to, excess, heat, are, also, known, hazards, the, current, niosh, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, noise, is, 85, dba, with, a, 3, dba, exchange, rate, and, the, msha, permissible, exposure, limit, pel, is, 90, dba, with, a, 5, dba, exchange, rate, as, an, 8, hour, time, weighted, average, niosh, has, found, that, 25, of, noise, exposed, workers, in, mining, quarrying, and, oil, and, gas, extraction, have, hearing, impairment, the, prevalence, of, hearing, loss, increased, by, 1, from, 1991, to, 2001, within, these, workers, noise, studies, have, been, conducted, in, several, mining, environments, stageloaders, 84, 102, dba, shearers, 85, 99, dba, auxiliary, fans, 84, 120, dba, continuous, mining, machines, 78, 109, dba, and, roof, bolters, 92, 103, dba, represent, some, of, the, noisiest, equipment, in, underground, coal, mines, dragline, oilers, dozer, operators, and, welders, using, air, arcing, were, occupations, with, the, highest, noise, exposures, among, surface, coal, miners, coal, mines, had, the, highest, hearing, loss, injury, likelihood, in, addition, to, the, environmental, impacts, of, mining, processes, a, prominent, criticism, pertaining, to, this, form, of, extractive, practice, and, of, mining, companies, are, the, human, rights, abuses, occurring, within, mining, sites, and, communities, close, to, them, frequently, despite, being, protected, by, international, labor, rights, miners, are, not, given, appropriate, equipment, to, provide, them, with, protection, from, possible, mine, collapse, or, from, harmful, pollutants, and, chemicals, expelled, during, the, mining, process, work, in, inhumane, conditions, spending, numerous, hours, working, in, extreme, heat, darkness, and, 14, hour, workdays, with, no, allocated, time, for, breaks, included, within, the, human, rights, abuses, that, occur, during, mining, processes, are, instances, of, child, labor, these, instances, are, a, cause, for, widespread, criticism, of, mining, cobalt, a, mineral, essential, for, powering, modern, technologies, such, as, laptops, smartphones, and, electric, vehicles, many, of, these, cases, of, child, laborers, are, found, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, reports, have, risen, of, children, carrying, sacks, of, cobalt, weighing, 25, kg, from, small, mines, to, local, traders, being, paid, for, their, work, only, in, food, and, accommodation, a, number, of, companies, such, as, apple, google, microsoft, and, tesla, have, been, implicated, in, lawsuits, brought, by, families, whose, children, were, severely, injured, or, killed, during, mining, activities, in, congo, in, december, 2019, 14, congolese, families, filed, a, lawsuit, against, glencore, a, mining, company, which, supplies, the, essential, cobalt, to, these, multinational, corporations, with, allegations, of, negligence, that, led, to, the, deaths, of, children, or, injuries, such, as, broken, spines, emotional, distress, and, forced, labor, there, have, also, been, instances, of, killings, and, evictions, attributed, to, conflicts, with, mining, companies, almost, a, third, of, 227, murders, in, 2020, were, of, indigenous, peoples, rights, activists, on, the, frontlines, of, climate, change, activism, linked, to, logging, mining, large, scale, agribusiness, hydroelectric, dams, and, other, infrastructure, according, to, global, witness, the, relationship, between, indigenous, peoples, and, mining, is, defined, by, struggles, over, access, to, land, in, australia, the, aboriginal, bininj, said, mining, posed, a, threat, to, their, living, culture, and, could, damage, sacred, heritage, sites, in, the, philippines, an, anti, mining, movement, has, raised, concerns, regarding, the, total, disregard, for, ancestral, land, rights, ifugao, peoples, opposition, to, mining, led, a, governor, to, proclaim, a, ban, on, mining, operations, in, mountain, province, philippines, in, brazil, more, than, 170, tribes, organized, a, march, to, oppose, controversial, attempts, to, strip, back, indigenous, land, rights, and, open, their, territories, to, mining, operations, the, united, nations, commission, on, human, rights, has, called, on, brazil, s, supreme, court, to, uphold, indigenous, land, rights, to, prevent, exploitation, by, mining, groups, and, industrial, agriculture, as, of, 2019, mponeng, is, the, world, s, deepest, mine, from, ground, level, reaching, a, depth, of, 4, km, 2, 5, mi, below, ground, level, the, trip, from, the, surface, to, the, bottom, of, the, mine, takes, over, an, hour, it, is, a, gold, mine, in, south, africa, s, gauteng, province, previously, known, as, western, deep, levels, 1, shaft, the, underground, and, surface, works, were, commissioned, in, 1987, the, mine, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, substantial, gold, mines, in, the, world, the, moab, khutsong, gold, mine, in, north, west, province, south, africa, has, the, world, s, longest, winding, steel, wire, rope, which, is, able, to, lower, workers, to, 3, 054, metres, 10, 020, ft, in, one, uninterrupted, four, minute, journey, the, deepest, mine, in, europe, is, the, 16th, shaft, of, the, uranium, mines, in, p, bram, czech, republic, at, 1, 838, metres, 6, 030, ft, second, is, bergwerk, saar, in, saarland, germany, at, 1, 750, metres, 5, 740, ft, the, deepest, open, pit, mine, in, the, world, is, bingham, canyon, mine, in, bingham, canyon, utah, united, states, at, over, 1, 200, metres, 3, 900, ft, the, largest, and, second, deepest, open, pit, copper, mine, in, the, world, is, chuquicamata, in, northern, chile, at, 900, metres, 3, 000, ft, which, annually, produces, 443, 000, tons, of, copper, and, 20, 000, tons, of, molybdenum, the, deepest, open, pit, mine, with, respect, to, sea, level, is, tagebau, hambach, in, germany, where, the, base, of, the, pit, is, 299, metres, 981, ft, below, sea, level, the, largest, underground, mine, is, kiirunavaara, mine, in, kiruna, sweden, with, 450, kilometres, 280, mi, of, roads, 40, million, tonnes, of, annually, produced, ore, and, a, depth, of, 1, 270, metres, 4, 170, ft, it, is, also, one, of, the, most, modern, underground, mines, the, deepest, borehole, in, the, world, is, kola, superdeep, borehole, at, 12, 262, metres, 40, 230, ft, but, this, is, connected, to, scientific, drilling, not, mining, during, the, 20th, century, the, variety, of, metals, used, in, society, grew, rapidly, today, the, development, of, major, nations, such, as, china, and, india, and, advances, in, technologies, are, fueling, an, ever, greater, demand, the, result, is, that, metal, mining, activities, are, expanding, and, more, and, more, of, the, world, s, metal, stocks, are, above, ground, in, use, rather, than, below, ground, as, unused, reserves, an, example, is, the, in, use, stock, of, copper, between, 1932, and, 1999, copper, in, use, in, the, us, rose, from, 73, kilograms, 161, lb, to, 238, kilograms, 525, lb, per, person, 95, of, the, energy, used, to, make, aluminium, from, bauxite, ore, is, saved, by, using, recycled, material, however, levels, of, metals, recycling, are, generally, low, in, 2010, the, international, resource, panel, hosted, by, the, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, published, reports, on, metal, stocks, that, exist, within, society, and, their, recycling, rates, the, report, s, authors, observed, that, the, metal, stocks, in, society, can, serve, as, huge, anthropogenic, mines, above, ground, however, they, warned, that, the, recycling, rates, of, some, rare, metals, used, in, applications, such, as, mobile, phones, battery, packs, for, hybrid, cars, and, fuel, cells, are, so, low, that, unless, future, end, of, life, recycling, rates, are, dramatically, stepped, up, these, critical, metals, will, become, unavailable, for, use, in, modern, technology, as, recycling, rates, are, low, and, so, much, metal, has, already, been, extracted, some, landfills, now, contain, higher, concentrations, of, metal, than, mines, themselves, this, is, especially, true, of, aluminum, used, in, cans, and, precious, metals, found, in, discarded, electronics, furthermore, waste, after, 15, years, has, still, not, broken, down, so, less, processing, would, be, required, when, compared, to, mining, ores, a, study, undertaken, by, cranfield, university, has, found, 360, million, of, metals, could, be, mined, from, just, four, landfill, sites, there, is, also, up, to, 20, mj, kg, of, energy, in, waste, potentially, making, the, re, extraction, more, profitable, however, although, the, first, landfill, mine, opened, in, tel, aviv, israel, in, 1953, little, work, has, followed, due, to, the, abundance, of, accessible, ores
