synonym, for, ethnic, pluralism, with, the, two, terms, often, used, interchangeably, and, for, cultural, pluralism, in, which, various, ethnic, and, cultural, groups, exist, in, a, single, society, it, can, describe, a, mixed, ethnic, community, area, where, multiple, cultural, traditions, exist, such, as, new, york, city, london, hong, kong, or, paris, or, a, single, country, within, which, they, do, such, as, switzerland, belgium, singapore, or, russia, groups, associated, with, an, indigenous, aboriginal, or, autochthonous, ethnic, group, and, settler, descended, ethnic, groups, are, often, the, focus, in, reference, to, sociology, multiculturalism, is, the, end, state, of, either, a, natural, or, artificial, process, for, example, legally, controlled, immigration, and, occurs, on, either, a, large, national, scale, or, on, a, smaller, scale, within, a, nation, s, communities, on, a, smaller, scale, this, can, occur, artificially, when, a, jurisdiction, is, established, or, expanded, by, amalgamating, areas, with, two, or, more, different, cultures, e, g, french, canada, and, english, canada, on, a, large, scale, it, can, occur, as, a, result, of, either, legal, or, illegal, migration, to, and, from, different, jurisdictions, around, the, world, in, reference, to, political, science, multiculturalism, can, be, defined, as, a, state, s, capacity, to, effectively, and, efficiently, deal, with, cultural, plurality, within, its, sovereign, borders, multiculturalism, as, a, political, philosophy, involves, ideologies, and, policies, which, vary, widely, it, has, been, described, as, a, salad, bowl, and, as, a, cultural, mosaic, in, contrast, to, a, melting, pot, states, that, embody, multicultural, ideals, have, arguably, existed, since, ancient, times, the, achaemenid, empire, founded, by, cyrus, the, great, followed, a, policy, of, incorporating, and, tolerating, various, cultures, a, historical, example, of, multiculturalism, was, the, habsburg, monarchy, which, had, broken, up, in, 1918, and, under, whose, roof, many, different, ethnic, linguistic, and, religious, groups, lived, together, the, habsburg, rule, was, mired, in, controversy, including, events, such, as, the, mass, murder, committed, against, sz, kelys, by, the, habsburg, army, in, 1764, and, the, destruction, of, romanian, orthodox, churches, and, monasteries, in, transylvania, by, adolf, nikolaus, von, buccow, both, events, had, happened, during, the, rule, of, maria, theresa, today, s, topical, issues, such, as, social, and, cultural, differentiation, multilingualism, competing, identity, offers, or, multiple, cultural, identities, have, already, shaped, the, scientific, theories, of, many, thinkers, of, this, multi, ethnic, empire, after, the, first, world, war, ethnic, minorities, were, disadvantaged, forced, to, emigrate, or, even, murdered, in, most, regions, in, the, area, of, the, former, habsburg, monarchy, due, to, the, prevailing, nationalism, at, the, time, in, many, areas, these, ethnic, mosaics, no, longer, exist, today, the, ethnic, mix, of, that, time, can, only, be, experienced, in, a, few, areas, such, as, in, the, former, habsburg, port, city, of, trieste, in, the, political, philosophy, of, multiculturalism, ideas, are, focused, on, the, ways, in, which, societies, are, either, believed, to, or, should, respond, to, cultural, and, christian, differences, it, is, often, associated, with, identity, politics, the, politics, of, difference, and, the, politics, of, recognition, it, is, also, a, matter, of, economic, interests, and, political, power, in, more, recent, times, political, multiculturalist, ideologies, have, been, expanding, in, their, use, to, include, and, define, disadvantaged, groups, such, as, african, americans, and, the, lgbt, community, with, arguments, often, focusing, on, ethnic, and, religious, minorities, minority, nations, indigenous, peoples, and, even, people, with, disabilities, it, is, within, this, context, in, which, the, term, is, most, commonly, understood, and, the, broadness, and, scope, of, the, definition, as, well, as, its, practical, use, has, been, the, subject, of, serious, debate, most, debates, over, multiculturalism, center, around, whether, or, not, multiculturalism, is, the, appropriate, way, to, deal, with, diversity, and, immigrant, integration, the, arguments, regarding, the, perceived, rights, to, a, multicultural, education, include, the, proposition, that, it, acts, as, a, way, to, demand, recognition, of, aspects, of, a, group, s, culture, subordination, and, its, entire, experience, in, contrast, to, a, melting, pot, or, non, multicultural, societies, the, term, multiculturalism, is, most, often, used, in, reference, to, western, nation, states, which, had, seemingly, achieved, a, de, facto, single, national, identity, during, the, 18th, and, or, 19th, centuries, multiculturalism, has, been, official, policy, in, several, western, nations, since, the, 1970s, for, reasons, that, varied, from, country, to, country, including, the, fact, that, many, of, the, great, cities, of, the, western, world, are, increasingly, made, of, a, mosaic, of, cultures, the, canadian, government, has, often, been, described, as, the, instigator, of, multicultural, ideology, because, of, its, public, emphasis, on, the, social, importance, of, immigration, the, canadian, royal, commission, on, bilingualism, and, biculturalism, is, often, referred, to, as, the, origins, of, modern, political, awareness, of, multiculturalism, canada, has, provided, provisions, to, the, french, speaking, majority, of, quebec, whereby, they, function, as, an, autonomous, community, with, special, rights, to, govern, the, members, of, their, community, as, well, as, establish, french, as, one, of, the, official, languages, in, the, western, english, speaking, countries, multiculturalism, as, an, official, national, policy, started, in, canada, in, 1971, followed, by, australia, in, 1973, where, it, is, maintained, today, it, was, quickly, adopted, as, official, policy, by, most, member, states, of, the, european, union, recently, right, of, center, governments, in, several, european, states, notably, the, netherlands, and, denmark, have, reversed, the, national, policy, and, returned, to, an, official, monoculturalism, a, similar, reversal, is, the, subject, of, debate, in, the, united, kingdom, among, others, due, to, evidence, of, incipient, segregation, and, anxieties, over, home, grown, terrorism, several, heads, of, state, or, heads, of, government, have, expressed, doubts, about, the, success, of, multicultural, policies, the, united, kingdom, s, ex, prime, minister, david, cameron, german, chancellor, angela, merkel, australia, s, ex, prime, minister, john, howard, spanish, ex, prime, minister, jos, mar, a, aznar, and, french, ex, president, nicolas, sarkozy, have, voiced, concerns, about, the, effectiveness, of, their, multicultural, policies, for, integrating, immigrants, many, nation, states, in, africa, asia, and, the, americas, are, culturally, diverse, and, are, multicultural, in, a, descriptive, sense, in, some, ethnic, communalism, is, a, major, political, issue, the, policies, adopted, by, these, states, often, have, parallels, with, multiculturalist, policies, in, the, western, world, but, the, historical, background, is, different, and, the, goal, may, be, a, mono, cultural, or, mono, ethnic, nation, building, for, instance, in, the, malaysian, government, s, attempt, to, create, a, malaysian, race, by, 2020, multiculturalism, is, seen, by, its, supporters, as, a, fairer, system, that, allows, people, to, truly, express, who, they, are, within, a, society, that, is, more, tolerant, and, that, adapts, better, to, social, issues, they, argue, that, culture, is, not, one, definable, thing, based, on, one, race, or, religion, but, rather, the, result, of, multiple, factors, that, change, as, the, world, changes, historically, support, for, modern, multiculturalism, stems, from, the, changes, in, western, societies, after, world, war, ii, in, what, susanne, wessendorf, calls, the, human, rights, revolution, in, which, the, horrors, of, institutionalized, racism, and, ethnic, cleansing, became, almost, impossible, to, ignore, in, the, wake, of, the, holocaust, with, the, collapse, of, the, european, colonial, system, as, colonized, nations, in, africa, and, asia, successfully, fought, for, their, independence, and, pointed, out, the, discriminatory, underpinnings, of, the, colonial, system, and, in, the, united, states, in, particular, with, the, rise, of, the, civil, rights, movement, which, criticized, ideals, of, assimilation, that, often, led, to, prejudices, against, those, who, did, not, act, according, to, anglo, american, standards, and, which, led, to, the, development, of, academic, ethnic, studies, programs, as, a, way, to, counteract, the, neglect, of, contributions, by, racial, minorities, in, classrooms, as, this, history, shows, multiculturalism, in, western, countries, was, seen, to, combat, racism, to, protect, minority, communities, of, all, types, and, to, undo, policies, that, had, prevented, minorities, from, having, full, access, to, the, opportunities, for, freedom, and, equality, promised, by, the, liberalism, that, has, been, the, hallmark, of, western, societies, since, the, age, of, enlightenment, the, contact, hypothesis, in, sociology, is, a, well, documented, phenomenon, in, which, cooperative, interactions, with, those, from, a, different, group, than, one, s, own, reduce, prejudice, and, inter, group, hostility, will, kymlicka, argues, for, group, differentiated, rights, that, help, both, religious, and, cultural, minorities, operate, within, the, larger, state, as, a, whole, without, impinging, on, the, rights, of, the, larger, society, he, bases, this, on, his, opinion, that, human, rights, fall, short, in, protecting, the, rights, of, minorities, as, the, state, has, no, stake, in, protecting, the, minorities, c, james, trotman, argues, that, multiculturalism, is, valuable, because, it, uses, several, disciplines, to, highlight, neglected, aspects, of, our, social, history, particularly, the, histories, of, women, and, minorities, promotes, respect, for, the, dignity, of, the, lives, and, voices, of, the, forgotten, by, closing, gaps, by, raising, consciousness, about, the, past, multiculturalism, tries, to, restore, a, sense, of, wholeness, in, a, postmodern, era, that, fragments, human, life, and, thought, tariq, modood, argues, that, in, the, early, years, of, the, 21st, century, multiculturalism, is, most, timely, and, necessary, and, we, need, more, not, less, since, it, is, the, form, of, integration, that, 1, best, fits, the, ideal, of, egalitarianism, 2, has, the, best, chance, of, succeeding, in, the, post, 9, 11, post, 7, 7, world, and, 3, has, remained, moderate, pragmatic, bhikhu, parekh, counters, what, he, sees, as, the, tendencies, to, equate, multiculturalism, with, racial, minorities, demanding, special, rights, and, to, see, these, as, promoting, a, thinly, veiled, racis, instead, he, argues, that, multiculturalism, is, in, fact, not, about, minorities, but, is, about, the, proper, terms, of, the, relationship, between, different, cultural, communities, which, means, that, the, standards, by, which, the, communities, resolve, their, differences, e, g, the, principles, of, justice, must, not, come, from, only, one, of, the, cultures, but, must, come, through, an, open, and, equal, dialogue, between, them, balibar, characterizes, criticisms, of, multiculturalism, as, differentialist, racism, which, he, describes, as, a, covert, form, of, racism, that, does, not, purport, ethnic, superiority, as, much, as, it, asserts, stereotypes, of, perceived, incompatibility, of, life, styles, and, traditions, while, there, is, research, that, suggests, that, ethnic, diversity, increases, chances, of, war, lower, public, goods, provision, and, decreases, democratization, there, is, also, research, that, shows, that, ethnic, diversity, in, itself, is, not, detrimental, to, peace, public, goods, provision, or, democracy, rather, it, was, found, that, promoting, diversity, actually, helps, in, advancing, disadvantaged, students, a, 2018, study, in, the, american, political, science, review, cast, doubts, on, findings, that, ethnoracial, homogeneity, led, to, greater, public, goods, provision, a, 2015, study, in, the, american, journal, of, sociology, challenged, past, research, showing, that, racial, diversity, adversely, affected, trust, critics, of, multiculturalism, often, debate, whether, the, multicultural, ideal, of, benignly, co, existing, cultures, that, interrelate, and, influence, one, another, and, yet, remain, distinct, is, sustainable, paradoxical, or, even, desirable, it, is, argued, that, nation, states, who, would, previously, have, been, synonymous, with, a, distinctive, cultural, identity, of, their, own, lose, out, to, enforced, multiculturalism, and, that, this, ultimately, erodes, the, host, nations, distinct, culture, sarah, song, views, cultures, as, historically, shaped, entities, by, its, members, and, that, they, lack, boundaries, due, to, globalization, thereby, making, them, stronger, than, others, might, assume, she, goes, on, to, argue, against, the, notion, of, special, rights, as, she, feels, cultures, are, mutually, constructive, and, are, shaped, by, the, dominant, culture, brian, barry, advocates, a, difference, blind, approach, to, culture, in, the, political, realm, and, he, rejects, group, based, rights, as, antithetical, to, the, universalist, liberal, project, which, he, views, as, based, on, the, individual, susan, moller, okin, a, feminist, professor, of, political, philosophy, argued, in, 1999, in, is, multiculturalism, bad, for, women, that, the, principle, that, all, cultures, are, equal, means, that, the, equal, rights, of, women, in, particular, are, sometimes, severely, violated, harvard, professor, of, political, science, robert, d, putnam, conducted, a, nearly, decade, long, study, on, how, multiculturalism, affects, social, trust, he, surveyed, 26, 200, people, in, 40, american, communities, finding, that, when, the, data, were, adjusted, for, class, income, and, other, factors, the, more, racially, diverse, a,

worse, than, had, been, imagined, and, it, s, not, just, that, we, don, t, trust, people, who, are, not, like, us, in, diverse, communities, we, don, t, trust, people, who, do, not, look, like, us, putnam, has, also, stated, however, that, this, allergy, to, diversity, tends, to, diminish, and, to, go, away, i, think, in, the, long, run, we, ll, all, be, better, putnam, denied, allegations, he, was, arguing, against, diversity, in, society, and, contended, that, his, paper, had, been, twisted, to, make, a, case, against, race, conscious, admissions, to, universities, he, asserted, that, his,

city, study, of, municipal, spending, on, public, goods, in, the, united, states, found, that, ethnically, or, racially, diverse, cities, spend, a, smaller, portion, of, their, budgets, and, less, per, capita, on, public, services, than, do, the, more, homogeneous, cities, dick, lamm, former, three, term, democratic, governor, of, the, us, state, of, colorado, argued, that, diverse, peoples, worldwide, are, mostly, engaged, in, hating, each, other, that, is, when, they, are, not, killing, each, other, a, diverse, peaceful, or, stable, society, is, against, most, historical, precedent, the, american, classicist, victor, davis, hanson, used, the, perceived, differences, in, rationality, between, moctezuma, and, cort, s, to, argue, that, western, culture, was, superior, to, every, culture, in, the, entire, world, which, thus, led, him, to, reject, multiculturalism, as, a, false, doctrine, that, placed, all, cultures, on, an, equal, footing, in, new, zealand, aotearoa, which,

canadian, governance, its, commitment, to, pluralism, and, its, support, for, the, rich, multicultural, diversity, of, its, people, is, something, that, must, be, shared, and, would, be, of, benefit,

government, very, similar, in, their, manners, and, customs, this, country, and, this, people, seem, to, have, been, made, for, each, other, and, it, appears, as, if, it, was, the, design, of, providence, that, an, inheritance, so, proper, and, convenient, for, a, band, of, brethren, united, to, each, other, by, the, strongest, ties, should, never, be, split, into, a, number, of, unsocial, jealous, and, alien, sovereignties, as, a, philosophy, multiculturalism, began, as, part, of, the, pragmatism, movement, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, europe, and, the, united, states, then, as, political, and, cultural, pluralism, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, partly, in, response, to, a, new, wave, of, european, imperialism, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, the, massive, immigration, of, southern, and, eastern, europeans, to, the, united, states, and, latin, america, philosophers, psychologists, and, historians, and, early, sociologists, such, as, charles, sanders, peirce, william, james, george, santayana, horace, kallen, john, dewey, w, e, b, du, bois, and, alain, locke, developed, concepts, of, cultural, pluralism, from, which, emerged, what, we, understand, today, as, multiculturalism, in, pluralistic, universe, 1909, william, james, espoused, the, idea, of, a, plural, society, james, saw, pluralism, as, crucial, to, the, formation, of, philosophical, and, social, humanism, to, help, build, a, better, more, egalitarian, society, the, educational, approach, to, multiculturalism, has, since, spread, to, the, grade, school, system, as, school, systems, try, to, rework, their, curricula, to, introduce, students, to, diversity, earlier, often, on, the, grounds, that, it, is, important, for, minority, students, to, see, themselves, represented, in, the, classroom, studies, estimated, 46, million, americans, ages, 14, to, 24, to, be, the, most, diverse, generation, in, american, society, in, 2009, and, 2010, controversy, erupted, in, texas, as, the, state, s, curriculum, committee, made, several, changes, to, the, state, s, requirements, often, at, the, expense, of, minorities, they, chose, to, juxtapose, abraham, lincoln, s, inaugural, address, with, that, of, confederate, president, jefferson, davis, they, debated, removing, supreme, court, justice, thurgood, marshall, and, labor, leader, cesar, chavez, and, rejected, calls, to, include, more, hispanic, figures, in, spite, of, the, high, hispanic, population, in, the, state, according, to, a, 2000, analysis, of, domestic, terrorism, in, the, united, states, a, distinctive, feature, of, american, terrorism, is, the, ideological, diversity, of, perpetrators, white, racists, are, responsible, for, over, a, third, of, the, deaths, and, black, militants, have, claimed, almost, as, many, almost, all, of, the, remaining, deaths, are, attributable, to, puerto, rican, nationalists, islamic, extremists, revolutionary, leftists, and, emigre, groups, twenty, years, later, far, right, and, white, racists, were, observed, as, the, leading, perpetrators, of, domestic, terrorism, in, the, u, s, according, to, a, 2020, study, by, the, strategic, international, studies, right, wing, extremists, are, responsible, for, the, murder, of, 329, people, since, 1994, over, half, due, to, the, terrorist, bombing, of, the, 1995, bombing, of, the, alfred, p, murrah, building, in, oklahoma, city, which, killed, 168, people, a, 2007, study, by, robert, putnam, encompassing, 30, 000, people, across, the, us, found, that, diversity, had, a, negative, effect, on, civic, engagement, the, greater, the, diversity, the, fewer, people, voted, and, the, less, they, volunteered, for, community, projects, also, trust, among, neighbours, was, only, half, that, of, homogenous, communities, putnam, says, however, that, in, the, long, run, immigration, and, diversity, are, likely, to, have, important, cultural, economic, fiscal, and, developmental, benefits, as, long, as, society, successfully, overcomes, the, short, term, problems, putnam, adds, that, his, extensive, research, and, experience, confirm, the, substantial, benefits, of, diversity, including, racial, and, ethnic, diversity, to, our, society, venezuela, is, home, to, a, variety, of, ethnic, groups, with, an, estimated, population, of, 32, million, their, population, is, composed, of,

christian, muslim, and, other, belief, systems, although, the, continent, was, supposedly, unified, by, the, super, position, of, imperial, roman, christianity, it, is, accepted, that, geographic, and, cultural, differences, continued, from, antiquity, into, the, modern, age, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, ideology, of, nationalism, transformed, the, way, europeans, thought, about, the, state, existing, states, were, broken, up, and, new, ones, created, the, new, nation, states, were, founded, on, the, principle, that, each, nation, is, entitled, to, its, own, sovereignty, and, to, engender, protect, and, preserve, its, own, unique, culture, and, history, unity, under, this, ideology, is, seen, as, an, essential, feature, of, the, nation, and, the, nation, state, unity, of, descent, unity, of, culture, unity, of, language, and, often, unity, of, religion, the, nation, state, constitutes, a, culturally, homogeneous, society, although, some, national, movements, recognised, regional, differences, where, cultural, unity, was, insufficient, it, was, encouraged, and, enforced, by, the, state, the, nineteenth, century, nation, states, developed, an, array, of, policies, the, most, important, was, compulsory, primary, education, in, the, national, language, the, language, itself, was, often, standardised, by, a, linguistic, academy, and, regional, languages, were, ignored, or, suppressed, some, nation, states, pursued, violent, policies, of, cultural, assimilation, and, even, ethnic, cleansing, some, countries, in, the, european, union, have, introduced, policies, for, social, cohesion, integration, and, sometimes, assimilation, the, policies, include, other, countries, have, instituted, policies, which, encourage, cultural, separation, the, concept, of, cultural, exception, proposed, by, france, in, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, gatt, negotiations, in, 1993, was, an, example, of, a, measure, aimed, at, protecting, local, cultures, since, its, establishment, in, the, seventh, century, bulgaria, has, hosted, many, religions, ethnic, groups, and, nations, the, capital, city, sofia, is, the, only, european, city, that,

is, to, become, a, symbol, of, the, capital, furthermore, unlike, some, other, nazi, germany, allies, or, german, occupied, countries, excluding, denmark, bulgaria, managed, to, save, its, entire, 48, 000, strong, jewish, population, during, world, war, ii, from, deportation, to, nazi, concentration, camps, according, to, dr, marinova, christidi, the, main, reason, for, the, efforts, of, bulgarian, people, to, save, their, jewish, population, during, wwii, is, that, within, the, region, they, co, existed, for, centuries, with, other, religions, giving, it, a, unique, multicultural, and, multiethnic, history, consequently, within, the, balkan, region, bulgaria, has, become, an, example, for, multiculturalism, in, terms, of, variety, of, religions, artistic, creativity, and, ethnicity, its, largest, ethnic, minority, groups, turks, and, roma, enjoy, wide, political, representation, in, 1984, following, a, campaign, by, the, communist, regime, for, a, forcible, change, of, the, islamic, names, of, the, turkish, minority, an, underground, organisation, called, national, liberation, movement, of, the, turks, in, bulgaria, was, formed, which, headed, the, turkish, community, s, opposition, movement, on, 4, january, 1990, the, activists, of, the, movement, registered, an, organisation, with, the, legal, name, movement, for, rights, and, freedoms, mrf, in, bulgarian, in, turkish, hak, ve, zg, rl, kler, hareketi, in, the, bulgarian, city, of, varna, at, the, moment, of, registration, it, had, 33, members, at, present, according, to, the, organisation, s, website, 68, 000, members, plus, 24, 000, in, the, organisation, s, youth, wing, in, 2012, bulgarian, turks, were, represented, at, every, level, of, government, local, with, mrf, having, mayors, in, 35,

minister, vezhdi, rashidov, 21, roma, political, organisations, were, founded, between, 1997, 2003, in, bulgaria, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, immigration, significantly, increased, during, the, period, of, reconstruction, france, lacked, the, labour, to, do, so, and, as, a, result, the, french, government, was, eager, to, recruit, immigrants, coming, from, all, over, europe, the, americas, africa, and, asia, although, there, was, a, presence, of, vietnamese, in, france, since, the, late, nineteenth, century, mostly, students, and, workers, a, wave, of, vietnamese, migrated, after, 1954, these, migrants, consisted, of, those, who, were, loyal, to, the, colonial, government, and, those, married, to, french, colonists, following, the, partition, of, vietnam, students, and, professionals, from, south, vietnam, continued, to, arrive, in, france, although, many, initially, returned, to, the, country, after, a, few, years, as, the, vietnam, war, situation, worsened, a, majority, decided, to, remain, in, france, and, brought, their, families, over, as, well, this, period, also, saw, a, significant, wave, of, immigrants, from, algeria, as, the, algerian, war, started, in, 1954, there, were, already, 200, 000, algerian, immigrants, in, france, however, because, of, the, tension, between, the, algerians, and, the, french, these, immigrants, were, no, longer, welcome, this, conflict, between, the, two, sides, led, to, the, paris, massacre, of, 17, october, 1961, when, the, police, used, force, against, an, algerian, demonstration, on, the, streets, of, paris, after, the, war, after, algeria, gained, its, independence, the, free, circulation, between, france, and, algeria, was, once, again, allowed, and, the, number, of, algerian, immigrants, started, to, increase, drastically, from, 1962, 75, the, algerian, immigrant, population, increased, from, 350, 000, to, 700, 000, many, of, these, immigrants, were, known, as, the, harkis, and, the, others, were, known, as, the, pieds, noirs, the, harkis, were, algerians, who, supported, the, french, during, the, algerian, war, once, the, war, was, over, they, were, deeply, resented, by, other, algerians, and, thus, had, to, flee, to, france, the, pieds, noirs, were, european, settlers, who, moved, to, algeria, but, migrated, back, to, france, since, 1962, when, algeria, declared, independence, according, to, erik, bleich, multiculturalism, in, france, faced, stiff, resistance, in, the, educational, sector, especially, regarding, recent, muslim, arrivals, from, algeria, gatekeepers, often, warned, that, multiculturalism, was, a, threat, to, the, historic, basis, of, french, culture, jeremy, jennings, finds, three, positions, among, elites, regarding, the, question, of, reconciling, traditional, french, republican, principles, with, multiculturalism, the, traditionalists, refuse, to, make, any, concessions, and, instead, insist, on, clinging, to, the, historic, republican, principles, of, la, cit, and, the, secular, state, in, which, religion, and, ethnicity, are, always, ignored, in, the, middle, are, modernising, republicans, who, uphold, republicanism, but, also, accept, some, elements, of, cultural, pluralism, finally, there, are, multiculturalist, republicans, who, envision, a, pluralist, conception, of, french, identity, and, seek, an, appreciation, of, the, positive, values, brought, to, france, by, the, minority, cultures, a, major, attack, on, multiculturalism, came, in, stasi, report, of, 2003, which, denounces, islamism, as, deeply, opposed, to, the, mainstream, interpretations, of, french, culture, it, is, portrayed, as, a, dangerous, political, agenda, that, will, create, a, major, obstacle, for, muslims, to, comply, with, french, secularism, or, la, cit, murat, akan, however, argues, that, the, stasi, report, and, the, new, regulations, against, the, hijab, and, religious, symbols, in, the, schools, must, be, set, against, gestures, toward, multiculturalism, such, as, the, creation, of, muslim, schools, under, contract, with, the, government, in, october, 2010, angela, merkel, told, a, meeting, of, younger, members, of, her, christian, democratic, union, cdu, party, at, potsdam, near, berlin, that, attempts, to, build, a, multicultural, society, in, germany, had, utterly, failed, stating, the, concept, that, we, are, now, living, side, by, side, and, are, happy, about, it, does, not, work, she, continued, to, say, that, immigrants, should, integrate, and, adopt, germany, s, culture, and, values, this, has, added, to, a, growing, debate, within, germany, on, the, levels, of, immigration, its, effect, on, germany, and, the, degree, to, which, middle, eastern, immigrants, have, integrated, into, german, society, in, 2015, merkel, again, criticized, multiculturalism, on, the, grounds, that, it, leads, to, parallel, societies, the, ahmadiyya, muslim, community, of, germany, is, the, first, muslim, group, to, have, been, granted, corporation, under, public, law, status, putting, the, community, on, par, with, the, major, christian, churches, and, jewish, communities, of, germany, luxembourg, has, one, of, the, highest, foreign, born, populations, in, europe, foreigners, account, for, nearly, half, of, the, country, s, total, population, the, majority, of, foreigners,

official, languages, of, luxembourg, are, german, french, and, luxembourgish, all, of, which, are, supported, in, the, luxembourg, government, and, education, system, in, 2005, luxembourg, officially, promoted, and, implemented, the, objectives, of, the, unesco, convention, on, the, protection, and, promotion, of, the, diversity, of, cultural, expressions, this, convention, affirms, multicultural, policies, in, luxembourg, and, creates, political, awareness, of, cultural, diversity, multiculturalism, in, the, netherlands, began, with, major, increases, in, immigration, to, the, netherlands, during, the, mid, 1950s, and, 1960s, as, a, consequence, an, official, national, policy, of, multiculturalism, was, adopted, in, the, early, 1980s, different, groups, could, themselves, determine, religious, and, cultural, matters, while, state, authorities, would, handle, matters, of, housing, and, work, policy, in, the, 1990s, the, public, debate, were, generally, optimistic, on, immigration, and, the, prevailing, view, was, that, a, multicultural, policy, would, reduce, the, social, economic, disparities, over, time, this, policy, subsequently, gave, way, to, more, assimilationist, policies, in, the, 1990s, and, post, electoral, surveys, uniformly, showed, from, 1994, onwards, that, a, majority, preferred, that, immigrants, assimilated, rather, than, retained, the, culture, of, their, country, of, origin, following, the, september, 11, attacks, in, the, united, states, and, the, murders, of, pim, fortuyn, in, 2002, and, theo, van, gogh, in, 2004, there, was, increased, political, debate, on, the, role, of, multiculturalism, in, the, netherlands, lord, sacks, chief, rabbi, of, the, united, hebrew, congregations, of, the, commonwealth, made, a, distinction, between, tolerance, and, multiculturalism, citing, the, netherlands, as, a, tolerant, rather, than, multicultural, society, in, june, 2011, the, first, rutte, cabinet, said, the, netherlands, would, turn, away, from, multiculturalism, dutch, culture, norms, and, values, must, be, dominant, minister, donner, said, since, antiquity, romania, has, hosted, many, religious, and, ethnic, groups, including, roma, people, hungarians, germans, turks, greeks, tatars, slovaks, serbs, jews, and, others, unfortunately, during, the, ww2, and, the, communism, most, of, these, ethnic, groups, chose, to, emigrate, to, other, countries, however, since, the, 1990s, romania, has, received, a, growing, number, of, immigrants, and, refugees, most, of, them, from, the, arab, world, asia, or, africa, immigration, is, expected, to, increase, in, the, future, as, large, numbers, of, romanian, workers, leave, the, country, and, are, being, replaced, by, foreigners, multiculturalism, in, scandinavia, has, centered, on, discussions, about, marriage, dress, religious, schools, muslim, funeral, rites, and, gender, equality, forced, marriages, have, been, widely, debated, in, denmark, sweden, and, norway, but, the, countries, differ, in, policy, and, responses, by, authorities, sweden, has, the, most, permissive, policies, while, denmark, the, most, restrictive, ones, in, 2001, denmark, a, liberal, conservative, coalition, government, with, the, support, of, the, danish, people, s, party, which, instituted, less, pluralistic, policy, geared, more, towards, assimilation, a, 2018, study, found, that, increases, in, local, ethnic, diversity, in, denmark, caused, rightward, shifts, in, election, outcomes, by, shifting, electoral, support, away, from, traditional, big, government, left, wing, parties, and, towards, anti, immigrant, nationalist, parties, for, decades, danish, immigration, policy, was, built, upon, the, belief, that, with, support, immigrants, and, their, descendants, would, eventually, reach, the, same, levels, of, education, as, danes, in, a, 2019, report, the, danish, immigration, service, and, the, ministry, of, education, found, this, to, be, false, the, report, found, that, while, the, second, generation, immigrants, without, a, western, background, do, better, than, their, parents, the, same, is, not, true, for, third, generation, immigrants, one, of, the, reasons, given, was, that, second, generation, immigrants, may, marry, someone, from, their, country, of, origin, which, may, cause, danish, not, to, be, spoken, at, home, which, would, put, the, children, at, a, disadvantage, in, school, thereby, the, process, of, integrating, has, to, start, from, the, beginning, for, each, generation, apart, from, citizens, of, nordic, countries, all, foreigners, must, apply, for, permanent, residency, in, order, to, live, and, work, in, norway, in, 2017, the, norwegian, immigrant, population, was, made, up, of, citizens, of, eu, and, eea, countries, 41, 2, citizens, of, asian, countries, including, turkey, 32, 4, citizens, of, african, countries, 13, 7, and, citizens, of, non, eu, eea, european, north, american, south, american, and, oceanian, countries, 12, 7, in, 2015, during, the, european, migrant, crisis, a, total, of, 31, 145, asylum, seekers, most, of, whom, came, from, afghanistan, and, syria, crossed, the, norwegian, border, in, 2016, the, number, of, asylum, seekers, dramatically, reduced, by, almost, 90, with, 3460, asylum, seekers, coming, to, norway, this, was, partly, due, to, the, stricter, border, control, across, europe, including, an, agreement, between, the, eu, and, turkey, as, of, september, 2019, 15, foreign, residents, who, had, travelled, from, norway, to, syria, or, iraq, to, join, the, islamic, state, have, had, their, residence, permits, revoked, the, progress, party, has, named, the, reduction, of, high, levels, of, immigration, from, non, european, countries, one, of, their, goals, an, extreme, form, of, opposition, to, immigration, in, norway, were, the, 22, 7, attacks, carried, out, by, the, terrorist, anders, behring, breivik, on, 22, july, 2011, he, killed, 8, people, by, bombing, government, buildings, in, oslo, and, massacred, 69, young, people, at, a, youth, summer, camp, held, by, the, labour, party, who, were, in, power, at, the, time, he, blamed, the, party, for, the, high, level, of, muslim, immigration, and, accused, it, of, promoting, multiculturalism, sweden, has, from, the, early, 1970s, experienced, a, greater, share, of, non, western, immigration, than, the, other, scandinavian, countries, which, consequently, have, placed, multiculturalism, on, the, political, agenda, for, a, longer, period, of, time, sweden, was, the, first, country, to, adopt, an, official, policy, of, multiculturalism, in, europe, on, 14, may, 1975, a, unanimous, swedish, parliament, passed, an, act, on, a, new, multiculturalist, immigrant, and, ethnic, minority, policy, put, forward, by, the, social, democratic, government, that, explicitly, rejected, the, ideal, ethnic, homogeneity, and, the, policy, of, assimilation, the, three, main, principles, of, the, new, policy, were, equality, partnership, and, freedom, of, choice, the, explicit, policy, aim, of, the, freedom, of, choice, principle, was, to, create, the, opportunity, for, minority, groups, in, sweden, to, retain, their, own, languages, and, cultures, from, the, mid, 1970s, the, goal, of, enabling, the, preservation, of, minorities, and, creating, a, positive, attitude, towards, the, new, officially, endorsed, multicultural, society, among, the, majority, population, became, incorporated, into, the, swedish, constitution, as, well, as, cultural, educational, and, media, policies, despite, the, anti, multiculturalist, protestations, of, the, sweden, democrats, multiculturalism, remains, official, policy, in, sweden, a, 2008, study, which, involved, questionnaires, sent, to, 5, 000, people, showed, that, less, than, a, quarter, of, the, respondents, 23, wanted, to, live, in, areas, characterised, by, cultural, ethnic, and, social, diversity, a, 2014, study, published, by, g, vle, university, college, showed, that, 38, of, the, population, never, interacted, with, anyone, from, africa, and, 20, never, interacted, with, any, non, europeans, the, study, concluded, that, while, physical, distance, to, the, country, of, origin, also, religion, and, other, cultural, expressions, are, significant, for, the, perception, of, cultural, familiarity, in, general, peoples, with, christianity, as, the, dominant, religion, were, perceived, to, be, culturally, closer, than, peoples, from, muslim, countries, a, 2017, study, by, lund, university, also, found, that, social, trust, was, lower, among, people, in, regions, with, high, levels, of, past, non, nordic, immigration, than, among, people, in, regions, with, low, levels, of, past, immigration, the, erosive, effect, on,

multiculturalist, approach, at, a, national, level, but, after, 2001, there, was, something, of, a, backlash, led, by, centre, left, commentators, such, as, david, goodhart, and, trevor, phillips, the, government, then, embraced, a, policy, of, community, cohesion, instead, in, 2011, conservative, prime, minister, david, cameron, said, in, a, speech, that, state, multiculturalism, has, failed, critics, argue, that, analyses, which, view, society, as, too, diverse, for, social, democracy, and, cohesion, have, performative, effects, regarding, legitimate, racism, towards, those, classed, as, immigrants, the, idea, of, multiculturalism, in, russia, is, closely, linked, to, the, territory, and, the, soviet, concept, of, nationality, the, federation, is, divided, into, a, series, of, republics, where, each, ethnic, group, has, preponderance, in, deciding, the, laws, that, affect, that, republic, a, distinction, is, then, made, between, rossiyane, russian, citizens, and, russkie,

festivities, india, has, encountered, religiously, motivated, violence, such, as, the, moplah, riots, the, bombay, riots, the, 1984, sikh, genocide, the, 1990, exodus, of, kashmiri, hindus, the, 2002, gujarat, riots, the, 2008, mumbai, attacks, the, 2012, assam, violence, the, 2013, muzaffarnagar, riots, and, the, 2020, delhi, riots, this, has, resulted, from, traditionally, disadvantaged,

as, a, forum, through, which, they, can, actively, participate, in, the, institutions, of, the, dominant, culture, indian, polity, after, the, 1990s, has, been, marked, by, a, shift, from, secular, principles, to, a, landscape, that, is, dominated, by, pro, hindu, propaganda, the, bhartiya, janata, party, has, used, this, rhetoric, by, reconstructing, hinduism, and, bartering, it, under, the, guise, of, indian, nationalism, however, the, rise, of, pro, hindu, ideology, commonly, known, as, hindutva, has, impinged, on, the, rights, of, cultural, minorities, this, can, be, seen, in, the, large, scale, violence, against, cultural, minorities, the, votebank, politics, used, by, the, indian, national, congress, and, the, promotion, of, issues, faced, by, the, larger, religious, communities, over, those, faced, by, the, backward, groups, in, religious, minorities, scheduled, castes, and, scheduled, tribes, are, constitutionally, recognized, terms, in, india, and, constitute, approximately, 25, of, the, indian, population, moreover, more, than, 40, percent, of, india, s, population, belongs, to, the, other, backward, castes, as, per, the, national, sample, survey, office, or, the, nsso, which, is, a, government, organization, for, conducting, surveys, in, india, so, the, total, size, of, the, lower, castes, in, india, is, estimated, to, be, around, 70, percent, of, the, country, s, population, whereas, the, upper, caste, make, up, around, 18, percent, of, the, population, it, has, also, been, noted, that, a, person, of, the, upper, caste, generally, tends, to, be, fairer, in, skin, whereas, the, lower, caste, tend, to, be, darker, these, groups, have, been, provided, with, reservations, that, constitutionally, guarantee, them, representation, in, governmental, institutions, a, mandate, suggested, by, the, mandal, commission, the, indian, constitution, also, provides, sc, s, and, st, s, with, protective, measures, that, ensure, equality, which, is, the, main, issue, faced, by, members, of, both, communities, however, while, scheduled, castes, have, turned, into, important, political, communities, that, the, state, concerns, itself, about, scheduled, tribes, continue, to, be, politically, marginalized, pluralism, diversity, and, multiculturalism, is, a, daily, fact, of, life, in, indonesia, there, are, over, 1, 300, ethnic, groups, in, indonesia, 95, of, those, are, of, native, indonesian, ancestry, the, javanese, are, the, largest, ethnic, group, in, indonesia, who, make, up, nearly, 42, of, the, total, population, the, sundanese, malay, and, madurese, are, the, next, largest, groups, in, the, country, there, are, also, more, than, 700, living, languages, spoken, in, indonesia, and, although, predominantly, muslim, the, country, also, has, large, christian, and, hindu, populations, indonesia, s, national, motto, bhinneka, tunggal, ika, unity, in, diversity, lit, many, yet, one, enshrined, in, pancasila, the, national, ideology, articulates, the, diversity, that, shapes, the, country, the, government, nurtures, and, promotes, the, diversity, of, indonesian, local, culture, adopting, a, pluralist, approach, due, to, migration, within, indonesia, as, part, of, government, transmigration, programs, or, otherwise, there, are, significant, populations, of, ethnic, groups, who, reside, outside, of, their, traditional, regions, the, javanese, for, example, moved, from, their, traditional, homeland, in, java, to, the, other, parts, of, the, archipelago, the, expansion, of, the, javanese, and, their, influence, throughout, indonesia, has, raised, the, issue, of, javanization, although, minangkabau, malay, madurese, bugis, and, makassar, people, as, a, result, of, their, merantau, migrating, culture, are, also, quite, widely, distributed, throughout, the, indonesian, archipelago, while, chinese, indonesians, can, be, found, in, most, urban, areas, because, of, urbanization, major, indonesian, cities, such, as, greater, jakarta, surabaya, bandung, palembang, medan, and, makassar, have, attracted, large, numbers, of, indonesians, from, various, ethnic, cultural, and, religious, backgrounds, jakarta, in, particular, has, almost, all, indonesian, ethnic, groups, represented, however, this, transmigration, program, and, close, interactions, between, people, of, different, cultural, backgrounds, caused, socio, cultural, problems, as, the, inter, ethnics, interactions, have, not, always, been, conducted, harmoniously, after, the, fall, of, suharto, in, 1998, into, the, 2000s, numbers, of, inter, ethnic, and, inter, religious, clashes, erupted, in, indonesia, like, the, clashes, between, native, dayak, tribes, against, madurese, transmigrants, in, kalimantan, during, sambas, riots, in, 1999, and, the, sampit, conflict, in, 2001, there, were, also, clashes, between, muslims, and, christians, such, as, violence, erupted, in, poso, between, 1998, and, into, 2000, and, violences, in, maluku, between, 1999, and, into, 2002, nevertheless, indonesia, today, still, struggles, and, has, managed, to, maintain, unity, and, inter, cultural, harmony, through, a, national, adherence, of, pro, pluralism, policy, of, pancasila, promoted, and, enforced, by, the, government, and, its, people, chinese, indonesians, are, the, largest, foreign, origin, minority, that, has, resided, in, indonesia, for, generations, despite, centuries, of, acculturation, with, native, indonesians, because, of, their, disproportionate, influence, on, indonesian, economy, and, alleged, question, of, national, loyalty, chinese, indonesians, have, suffered, discrimination, the, suharto, orde, baru, or, new, order, adopted, a, forced, assimilation, policy, which, indicated, that, chinese, cultural, elements, were, unacceptable, chinese, indonesians, were, forced, to, adopt, indonesian, sounding, names, and, the, use, of, chinese, culture, and, language, was, banned, the, violence, targeting, chinese, indonesians, erupted, during, riots, in, 1998, as, the, looting, and, destruction, took, place, a, number, of, chinese, indonesians, as, well, as, looters, were, killed, the, chinese, indonesians, were, treated, as, the, scapegoat, of, 1997, asian, financial, crisis, a, result, of, ongoing, discrimination, and, segregation, policies, enforced, during, suharto, s, new, order, regime, soon, after, the, fourth, indonesian, president, abdurrahman, wahid, came, into, power, in, 1999, he, quickly, abolished, some, of, the, discriminatory, laws, in, efforts, to, promote, acceptance, and, to, improve, inter, racial, relationships, such, as, abolishing, the, ban, on, chinese, culture, allowing, chinese, traditions, to, be, practised, freely, two, years, later, president, megawati, sukarnoputri, declared, that, the, chinese, new, year, imlek, would, be, marked, as, a, national, holiday, from, 2003, tense, incidents, however, have, included, attacks, on,

malays, have, been, decreasing, continually, especially, the, chinese, due, in, large, part, to, lower, birth, rate, and, emigration, as, a, result, of, institutionalized, discrimination, preceding, independence, of, the, federation, of, malaya, a, social, contract, was, negotiated, as, the, basis, of, a, new, society, the, contract, as, reflected, in, the, 1957, malayan, constitution, and, the, 1963, malaysian, constitution, states, that, the, immigrant, groups, are, granted, citizenship, and, malays, special, rights, are, guaranteed, this, is, often, referred, to, the, bumiputra, policy, these, pluralist, policies, have, come, under, pressure, from, racialist, malay, parties, who, oppose, perceived, subversion, of, malay, rights, the, issue, is, sometimes, related, to, the,

all, group, representation, constituencies, are, required, to, field, at, least, one, candidate, from, an, ethnic, minority, today, such, ethnic, enclaves, has, mostly, been, eliminated, due, to, the, contemporary, singapore, s, government, policy, to, encourage, further, ethnic, integration, between, the, different, races, of, singapore, a, prominent, example, is, its, public, housing, system, unlike, other, countries, public, housing, is, not, ostracised, by, a, wide, majority, of, the, population, and, its, government, and, acts, as, a, necessary, and, vital, measure, to, provide,

relatively, homogenous, country, ethnically, linguistically, and, culturally, foreigners, expatriates, and, immigrants, are, often, rejected, by, the, mainstream, south, korean, society, and, face, discrimination, this, can, be, seen, as, a, result, of, world, war, ii, where, the, first, noteworthy, wave, of, multiculturalism, between, american, servicemen, and, korean, women, occurred, south, korea, has, been, long, regarded, as, an, ethnic, homogeneous, country, therefore, the, rise, in, mixed, race, children, was, seen, as, a, new, phenomenon, before, the, 1990s, the, term, honhyeol, was, commonly, used, to, identify, multiracial, individuals, in, korea, primarily, in, relation, to, the, children, of, korean, women, and, american, servicemen, this, common, term, strengthened, the, association, of, multiracial, people, with, a, sense, of, alienation, rather, than, promoting, cultural, diversity, within, korea, not, only, did, this, term, effectively, discriminate, against, mixed, race, koreans, but, it, also, made, a, clear, distinction, between, native, koreans, and, mixed, race, koreans, han, geon, soo, 2007, notes, the, increased, use, of, the, word, multiculturalism, in, south, korea, as, the, increase, of, foreign, migrants, in, korea, transforms, a, single, ethnic, homogeneous, korean, society, into, multiethnic, and, multicultural, one, korean, government, and, the, civil, society, pay, close, attention, to, multiculturalism, as, an, alternative, value, to, their, policy, and, social, movement, he, argued, however, that, the, current, discourses, and, concerns, on, multiculturalism, in, korea, lacked, the, constructive, and, analytical, concepts, for, transforming, a, society, the, same, year, stephen, castles, of, the, international, migration, institute, argued, the, korea, times, suggested, in, 2009, that, south, korea, was, likely, to, become, a, multicultural, society, in, 2010, an, opinion, editorial, written, by, peter, underwood, for, the, joongang, ilbo, stated, media, in, korea, is, abuzz, with, the, new, era, of, multiculturalism, with, more, than, one, million, foreigners, in, korea, 2, percent, of, the, population, comes, from, other, cultures, he, further, opined, in, 2010, results, from, the, korean, identity, survey, suggested, that, government, programs, promoting, multiculturalism, had, seen, some, success, with, over, 60, of, koreans, supporting, the, idea, a, multicultural, society, however, the, same, poll, in, 2015, showed, that, support, of, a, multicultural, society, had, dropped, to, 49, 7, suggesting, a, possible, return, to, ethnic, exclusivism, turkey, is, a, country, that, borders, both, europe, and, asia, and, is, above, africa, it, is, home, to, several, ethnic,

diffused, and, mingled, in, myriad, ways, over, a, period, of, centuries, in, recent, years, there, has, been, an, increase, of, diversity, acceptance, in, turkey, mainly, because, there, was, fear, of, losing, values, of, the, ottoman, past, officially, known, as, the, republic, of, cameroon, cameroon, is, found, in, central, africa, consisting, of, a, diverse, geographical, and, cultural, area, that, makes, it, one, of, the, most, diverse, countries, known, today, ranging, from, mountains, deserts, and, rainforests, to, coast, lands, and, savanna, grasslands, its, diverse, geography, makes, a, large, diverse, population, possible, this, diverse, geography, resembles, africa, as, a, whole, and, due, to, this, many, people, commonly, label, cameroon, as, africa, in, miniature, before, cameroon, s, independence, it, was, under, british, and, french, colonial, rule, from, 1916, 1961, upon, gaining, sovereignty, a, major, colonial, influence, was, evident, having, both, english, and, french, become, the, national, language, to, roughly, 25, 000, 000, cameroonian, residents, apart, from, these, two, major, languages, a, new, language, consisting, of, a, mixture, of, french, english, and, pidgin, known, as, frananglais, gained, popularity, among, cameroonian, residents, although, these, three, languages, are, the, most, common, in, cameroon, there, are, still, approximately, 273, indigenous, languages, being, spoken, throughout, the, country, making, it, not, only, culturally, diverse, but, linguistically, as, well, among, those, who, speak, these, indigenous, languages, are, people, from, bantu, sudanic, baka, wodaabe, or, mbororo, and, even, primitive, hunter, gatherer, groups, known, as, pygmies, although, native, to, cameroonian, land, they, faced, constant, discrimination, much, like, other, indigenous, groups, around, the, world, the, united, nations, general, assembly, unga, adopted, the, united, nations, declaration, on, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, undrip, in, 2007, what, this, allowed, was, the, protection, of, land, and, resource, rights, and, prevented, others, from, exploiting, or, violating, them, in, 2016, a, group, of, indigenous, baka, and, bagyeli, groups, united, to, form, gbabandi, gbabandi, allowed, these, indigenous, groups, to, have, a, form, of, representation, and, a, declared, list, of, requirements, that, people, of, cameroon, had, to, abide, by, among, these, requirements, were, guaranteed, land, rights, peoples, consent, to, the, usage, of, their, sacred, land, traditional, chiefs, and, the, ability, to, participate, in, local, regional, and, national, levels, of, political, and, economic, matters, as, a, result, this, established, a, sense, of, justice, and, acknowledgment, among, indigenous, groups, in, cameroon, and, posed, for, future, battles, for, indigenous, peoples, rights, multiculturalism, has, been, a, characteristic, feature, of, the, island, of, mauritius, this, is, mainly, because, of, colonization, that, has, been, present, from, the, english, the, french, and, the, dutch, however, the, mauritian, society, includes, people, from, many,

situations, and, similar, policies, for, example, the, formation, of, the, special, broadcasting, service, the, australian, government, retains, multiculturalism, in, policy, and, as, a, defining, aspect, of, australia, today, the, white, australia, policy, was, dismantled, after, world, war, ii, by, various, changes, to, immigration, policy, although, the, official, policy, of, multiculturalism, was, not, formally, introduced, until, 1972, the, election, of, john, howard, s, liberal, national, coalition, government, in, 1996, was, a, major, watershed, for, australian, multiculturalism, howard, had, long, been, a, critic, of, multiculturalism, releasing, his, one, australia, policy, in, the, late, 1980s, a, practical, reference, to, religious, diversity, for,
