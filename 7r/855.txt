racism, is, discrimination, and, prejudice, against, people, based, on, their, race, or, ethnicity, racism, can, be, present, in, social, actions, practices, or, political, systems, e, g, apartheid, that, support, the, expression, of, prejudice, or, aversion, in, discriminatory, practices, the, ideology, underlying, racist, practices, often, assumes, that, humans, can, be, subdivided, into, distinct, groups, that, are, different, in, their, social, behavior, and, innate, capacities, and, that, can, be, ranked, as, inferior, or, superior, racist, ideology, can, become, manifest, in, many, aspects, of, social, life, associated, social, actions, may, include, nativism, xenophobia, otherness, segregation, hierarchical, ranking, supremacism, and, related, social, phenomena, racism, refers, to, violation, of, racial, equality, based, on, equal, opportunities, formal, equality, or, based, on, equality, of, outcomes, for, different, races, or, ethnicities, also, called, substantive, equality, while, the, concepts, of, race, and, ethnicity, are, considered, to, be, separate, in, contemporary, social, science, the, two, terms, have, a, long, history, of, equivalence, in, popular, usage, and, older, social, science, literature, ethnicity, is, often, used, in, a, sense, close, to, one, traditionally, attributed, to, race, the, division, of, human, groups, based, on, qualities, assumed, to, be, essential, or, innate, to, the, group, e, g, shared, ancestry, or, shared, behavior, racism, and, racial, discrimination, are, often, used, to, describe, discrimination, on, an, ethnic, or, cultural, basis, independent, of, whether, these, differences, are, described, as, racial, according, to, the, united, nations, s, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, racial, discrimination, there, is, no, distinction, between, the, terms, racial, and, ethnic, discrimination, it, further, concludes, that, superiority, based, on, racial, differentiation, is, scientifically, false, morally, condemnable, socially, unjust, and, dangerous, the, convention, also, declared, that, there, is, no, justification, for, racial, discrimination, anywhere, in, theory, or, in, practice, racism, is, frequently, described, as, a, relatively, modern, concept, including, anti, jewish, racism, documented, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, evolving, in, the, european, age, of, imperialism, transformed, by, capitalism, and, the, atlantic, slave, trade, of, which, it, was, a, major, driving, force, it, was, also, a, major, force, behind, racial, segregation, in, the, united, states, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, and, of, apartheid, in, south, africa, 19th, and, 20th, century, racism, in, western, culture, is, particularly, well, documented, and, constitutes, a, reference, point, in, studies, and, discourses, about, racism, racism, has, played, a, role, in, genocides, such, as, the, holocaust, the, armenian, genocide, the, rwandan, genocide, and, the, genocide, of, serbs, in, the, independent, state, of, croatia, as, well, as, colonial, projects, including, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, africa, asia, and, the, population, transfer, in, the, soviet, union, including, deportations, of, indigenous, minorities, indigenous, peoples, have, been, and, are, often, subject, to, racist, attitudes, in, the, 19th, century, many, scientists, subscribed, to, the, belief, that, the, human, population, can, be, divided, into, races, the, term, racism, is, a, noun, describing, the, state, of, being, racist, i, e, subscribing, to, the, belief, that, the, human, population, can, or, should, be, classified, into, races, with, differential, abilities, and, dispositions, which, in, turn, may, motivate, a, political, ideology, in, which, rights, and, privileges, are, differentially, distributed, based, on, racial, categories, the, term, racist, may, be, an, adjective, or, a, noun, the, latter, describing, a, person, who, holds, those, beliefs, the, origin, of, the, root, word, race, is, not, clear, linguists, generally, agree, that, it, came, to, the, english, language, from, middle, french, but, there, is, no, such, agreement, on, how, it, generally, came, into, latin, based, languages, a, recent, proposal, is, that, it, derives, from, the, arabic, ra, s, which, means, head, beginning, origin, or, the, hebrew, rosh, which, has, a, similar, meaning, early, race, theorists, generally, held, the, view, that, some, races, were, inferior, to, others, and, they, consequently, believed, that, the, differential, treatment, of, races, was, fully, justified, these, early, theories, guided, pseudo, scientific, research, assumptions, the, collective, endeavors, to, adequately, define, and, form, hypotheses, about, racial, differences, are, generally, termed, scientific, racism, though, this, term, is, a, misnomer, due, to, the, lack, of, any, actual, science, backing, the, claims, most, biologists, anthropologists, and, sociologists, reject, a, taxonomy, of, races, in, favor, of, more, specific, and, or, empirically, verifiable, criteria, such, as, geography, ethnicity, or, a, history, of, endogamy, human, genome, research, indicates, that, race, is, not, a, meaningful, genetic, classification, of, humans, an, entry, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, 2008, defines, racialism, as, n, earlier, term, than, racism, but, now, largely, superseded, by, it, and, cites, the, term, racialism, in, a, 1902, quote, the, revised, oxford, english, dictionary, cites, the, shorter, term, racism, in, a, quote, from, the, year, 1903, it, was, defined, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, 2nd, edition, 1989, as, he, theory, that, distinctive, human, characteristics, and, abilities, are, determined, by, race, the, same, dictionary, termed, racism, a, synonym, of, racialism, belief, in, the, superiority, of, a, particular, race, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, racism, had, acquired, the, same, supremacist, connotations, formerly, associated, with, racialism, racism, by, then, implied, racial, discrimination, racial, supremacism, and, a, harmful, intent, the, term, race, hatred, had, also, been, used, by, sociologist, frederick, hertz, in, the, late, 1920s, as, its, history, indicates, the, popular, use, of, the, word, racism, is, relatively, recent, the, word, came, into, widespread, usage, in, the, western, world, in, the, 1930s, when, it, was, used, to, describe, the, social, and, political, ideology, of, nazism, which, treated, race, as, a, naturally, given, political, unit, it, is, commonly, agreed, that, racism, existed, before, the, coinage, of, the, word, but, there, is, not, a, wide, agreement, on, a, single, definition, of, what, racism, is, and, what, it, is, not, today, some, scholars, of, racism, prefer, to, use, the, concept, in, the, plural, racisms, in, order, to, emphasize, its, many, different, forms, that, do, not, easily, fall, under, a, single, definition, they, also, argue, that, different, forms, of, racism, have, characterized, different, historical, periods, and, geographical, areas, garner, 2009, p, 11, summarizes, different, existing, definitions, of, racism, and, identifies, three, common, elements, contained, in, those, definitions, of, racism, first, a, historical, hierarchical, power, relationship, between, groups, second, a, set, of, ideas, an, ideology, about, racial, differences, and, third, discriminatory, actions, practices, though, many, countries, around, the, globe, have, passed, laws, related, to, race, and, discrimination, the, first, significant, international, human, rights, instrument, developed, by, the, united, nations, un, was, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, udhr, which, was, adopted, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, in, 1948, the, udhr, recognizes, that, if, people, are, to, be, treated, with, dignity, they, require, economic, rights, social, rights, including, education, and, the, rights, to, cultural, and, political, participation, and, civil, liberty, it, further, states, that, everyone, is, entitled, to, these, rights, without, distinction, of, any, kind, such, as, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political, or, other, opinion, national, or, social, origin, property, birth, or, other, status, the, un, does, not, define, racism, however, it, does, define, racial, discrimination, according, to, the, 1965, un, international, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, racial, discrimination, the, term, racial, discrimination, shall, mean, any, distinction, exclusion, restriction, or, preference, based, on, race, colour, descent, or, national, or, ethnic, origin, that, has, the, purpose, or, effect, of, nullifying, or, impairing, the, recognition, enjoyment, or, exercise, on, an, equal, footing, of, human, rights, and, fundamental, freedoms, in, the, political, economic, social, cultural, or, any, other, field, of, public, life, in, their, 1978, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organization, unesco, declaration, on, race, and, racial, prejudice, article, 1, the, un, states, all, human, beings, belong, to, a, single, species, and, are, descended, from, a, common, stock, they, are, born, equal, in, dignity, and, rights, and, all, form, an, integral, part, of, humanity, the, un, definition, of, racial, discrimination, does, not, make, any, distinction, between, discrimination, based, on, ethnicity, and, race, in, part, because, the, distinction, between, the, two, has, been, a, matter, of, debate, among, academics, including, anthropologists, similarly, in, british, law, the, phrase, racial, group, means, any, group, of, people, who, are, defined, by, reference, to, their, race, colour, nationality, including, citizenship, or, ethnic, or, national, origin, in, norway, the, word, race, has, been, removed, from, national, laws, concerning, discrimination, because, the, use, of, the, phrase, is, considered, problematic, and, unethical, the, norwegian, anti, discrimination, act, bans, discrimination, based, on, ethnicity, national, origin, descent, and, skin, color, sociologists, in, general, recognize, race, as, a, social, construct, this, means, that, although, the, concepts, of, race, and, racism, are, based, on, observable, biological, characteristics, any, conclusions, drawn, about, race, on, the, basis, of, those, observations, are, heavily, influenced, by, cultural, ideologies, racism, as, an, ideology, exists, in, a, society, at, both, the, individual, and, institutional, level, while, much, of, the, research, and, work, on, racism, during, the, last, half, century, or, so, has, concentrated, on, white, racism, in, the, western, world, historical, accounts, of, race, based, social, practices, can, be, found, across, the, globe, thus, racism, can, be, broadly, defined, to, encompass, individual, and, group, prejudices, and, acts, of, discrimination, that, result, in, material, and, cultural, advantages, conferred, on, a, majority, or, a, dominant, social, group, so, called, white, racism, focuses, on, societies, in, which, white, populations, are, the, majority, or, the, dominant, social, group, in, studies, of, these, majority, white, societies, the, aggregate, of, material, and, cultural, advantages, is, usually, termed, white, privilege, race, and, race, relations, are, prominent, areas, of, study, in, sociology, and, economics, much, of, the, sociological, literature, focuses, on, white, racism, some, of, the, earliest, sociological, works, on, racism, were, written, by, sociologist, w, e, b, du, bois, the, first, african, american, to, earn, a, doctoral, degree, from, harvard, university, du, bois, wrote, he, problem, of, the, twentieth, century, is, the, problem, of, the, color, line, wellman, 1993, defines, racism, as, culturally, sanctioned, beliefs, which, regardless, of, intentions, involved, defend, the, advantages, whites, have, because, of, the, subordinated, position, of, racial, minorities, in, both, sociology, and, economics, the, outcomes, of, racist, actions, are, often, measured, by, the, inequality, in, income, wealth, net, worth, and, access, to, other, cultural, resources, such, as, education, between, racial, groups, in, sociology, and, social, psychology, racial, identity, and, the, acquisition, of, that, identity, is, often, used, as, a, variable, in, racism, studies, racial, ideologies, and, racial, identity, affect, individuals, perception, of, race, and, discrimination, cazenave, and, maddern, 1999, define, racism, as, a, highly, organized, system, of, race, based, group, privilege, that, operates, at, every, level, of, society, and, is, held, together, by, a, sophisticated, ideology, of, color, race, supremacy, racial, centrality, the, extent, to, which, a, culture, recognizes, individuals, racial, identity, appears, to, affect, the, degree, of, discrimination, african, american, young, adults, perceive, whereas, racial, ideology, may, buffer, the, detrimental, emotional, effects, of, that, discrimination, sellers, and, shelton, 2003, found, that, a, relationship, between, racial, discrimination, and, emotional, distress, was, moderated, by, racial, ideology, and, social, beliefs, some, sociologists, also, argue, that, particularly, in, the, west, where, racism, is, often, negatively, sanctioned, in, society, racism, has, changed, from, being, a, blatant, to, a, more, covert, expression, of, racial, prejudice, the, newer, more, hidden, and, less, easily, detectable, forms, of, racism, which, can, be, considered, embedded, in, social, processes, and, structures, are, more, difficult, to, explore, and, challenge, it, has, been, suggested, that, while, in, many, countries, overt, or, explicit, racism, has, become, increasingly, taboo, even, among, those, who, display, egalitarian, explicit, attitudes, an, implicit, or, aversive, racism, is, still, maintained, subconsciously, this, process, has, been, studied, extensively, in, social, psychology, as, implicit, associations, and, implicit, attitudes, a, component, of, implicit, cognition, implicit, attitudes, are, evaluations, that, occur, without, conscious, awareness, towards, an, attitude, object, or, the, self, these, evaluations, are, generally, either, favorable, or, unfavorable, they, come, about, from, various, influences, in, the, individual, experience, implicit, attitudes, are, not, consciously, identified, or, they, are, inaccurately, identified, traces, of, past, experience, that, mediate, favorable, or, unfavorable, feelings, thoughts, or, actions, towards, social, objects, these, feelings, thoughts, or, actions, have, an, influence, on, behavior, of, which, the, individual, may, not, be, aware, therefore, subconscious, racism, can, influence, our, visual, processing, and, how, our, minds, work, when, we, are, subliminally, exposed, to, faces, of, different, colors, in, thinking, about, crime, for, example, social, psychologist, jennifer, l, eberhardt, 2004, of, stanford, university, holds, that, blackness, is, so, associated, with, crime, you, re, ready, to, pick, out, these, crime, objects, such, exposures, influence, our, minds, and, they, can, cause, subconscious, racism, in, our, behavior, towards, other, people, or, even, towards, objects, thus, racist, thoughts, and, actions, can, arise, from, stereotypes, and, fears, of, which, we, are, not, aware, for, example, scientists, and, activists, have, warned, that, the, use, of, the, stereotype, nigerian, prince, for, referring, to, advance, fee, scammers, is, racist, i, e, reducing, nigeria, to, a, nation, of, scammers, and, fraudulent, princes, as, some, people, still, do, online, is, a, stereotype, that, needs, to, be, called, out, language, linguistics, and, discourse, are, active, areas, of, study, in, the, humanities, along, with, literature, and, the, arts, discourse, analysis, seeks, to, reveal, the, meaning, of, race, and, the, actions, of, racists, through, careful, study, of, the, ways, in, which, these, factors, of, human, society, are, described, and, discussed, in, various, written, and, oral, works, for, example, van, dijk, 1992, examines, the, different, ways, in, which, descriptions, of, racism, and, racist, actions, are, depicted, by, the, perpetrators, of, such, actions, as, well, as, by, their, victims, he, notes, that, when, descriptions, of, actions, have, negative, implications, for, the, majority, and, especially, for, white, elites, they, are, often, seen, as, controversial, and, such, controversial, interpretations, are, typically, marked, with, quotation, marks, or, they, are, greeted, with, expressions, of, distance, or, doubt, the, previously, cited, book, the, souls, of, black, folk, by, w, e, b, du, bois, represents, early, african, american, literature, that, describes, the, author, s, experiences, with, racism, when, he, was, traveling, in, the, south, as, an, african, american, much, american, fictional, literature, has, focused, on, issues, of, racism, and, the, black, racial, experience, in, the, us, including, works, written, by, whites, such, as, uncle, tom, s, cabin, to, kill, a, mockingbird, and, imitation, of, life, or, even, the, non, fiction, work, black, like, me, these, books, and, others, like, them, feed, into, what, has, been, called, the, white, savior, narrative, in, film, in, which, the, heroes, and, heroines, are, white, even, though, the, story, is, about, things, that, happen, to, black, characters, textual, analysis, of, such, writings, can, contrast, sharply, with, black, authors, descriptions, of, african, americans, and, their, experiences, in, us, society, african, american, writers, have, sometimes, been, portrayed, in, african, american, studies, as, retreating, from, racial, issues, when, they, write, about, whiteness, while, others, identify, this, as, an, african, american, literary, tradition, called, the, literature, of, white, estrangement, part, of, a, multi, pronged, effort, to, challenge, and, dismantle, white, supremacy, in, the, us, according, to, dictionary, definitions, racism, is, prejudice, and, discrimination, based, on, race, racism, can, also, be, said, to, describe, a, condition, in, society, in, which, a, dominant, racial, group, benefits, from, the, oppression, of, others, whether, that, group, wants, such, benefits, or, not, foucauldian, scholar, ladelle, mcwhorter, in, her, 2009, book, racism, and, sexual, oppression, in, anglo, america, a, genealogy, posits, modern, racism, similarly, focusing, on, the, notion, of, a, dominant, group, usually, whites, vying, for, racial, purity, and, progress, rather, than, an, overt, or, obvious, ideology, focused, on, the, oppression, of, nonwhites, in, popular, usage, as, in, some, academic, usage, little, distinction, is, made, between, racism, and, ethnocentrism, often, the, two, are, listed, together, as, racial, and, ethnic, in, describing, some, action, or, outcome, that, is, associated, with, prejudice, within, a, majority, or, dominant, group, in, society, furthermore, the, meaning, of, the, term, racism, is, often, conflated, with, the, terms, prejudice, bigotry, and, discrimination, racism, is, a, complex, concept, that, can, involve, each, of, those, but, it, cannot, be, equated, with, nor, is, it, synonymous, with, these, other, terms, the, term, is, often, used, in, relation, to, what, is, seen, as, prejudice, within, a, minority, or, subjugated, group, as, in, the, concept, of, reverse, racism, reverse, racism, is, a, concept, often, used, to, describe, acts, of, discrimination, or, hostility, against, members, of, a, dominant, racial, or, ethnic, group, while, favoring, members, of, minority, groups, this, concept, has, been, used, especially, in, the, united, states, in, debates, over, color, conscious, policies, such, as, affirmative, action, intended, to, remedy, racial, inequalities, however, many, experts, and, other, commenters, view, reverse, racism, as, a, myth, rather, than, a, reality, academics, commonly, define, racism, not, only, in, terms, of, individual, prejudice, but, also, in, terms, of, a, power, structure, that, protects, the, interests, of, the, dominant, culture, and, actively, discriminates, against, ethnic, minorities, from, this, perspective, while, members, of, ethnic, minorities, may, be, prejudiced, against, members, of, the, dominant, culture, they, lack, the, political, and, economic, power, to, actively, oppress, them, and, they, are, therefore, not, practicing, racism, the, ideology, underlying, racism, can, manifest, in, many, aspects, of, social, life, such, aspects, are, described, in, this, section, although, the, list, is, not, exhaustive, aversive, racism, is, a, form, of, implicit, racism, in, which, a, person, s, unconscious, negative, evaluations, of, racial, or, ethnic, minorities, are, realized, by, a, persistent, avoidance, of, interaction, with, other, racial, and, ethnic, groups, as, opposed, to, traditional, overt, racism, which, is, characterized, by, overt, hatred, for, and, explicit, discrimination, against, racial, ethnic, minorities, aversive, racism, is, characterized, by, more, complex, ambivalent, expressions, and, attitudes, aversive, racism, is, similar, in, implications, to, the, concept, of, symbolic, or, modern, racism, described, below, which, is, also, a, form, of, implicit, unconscious, or, covert, attitude, which, results, in, unconscious, forms, of, discrimination, the, term, was, coined, by, joel, kovel, to, describe, the, subtle, racial, behaviors, of, any, ethnic, or, racial, group, who, rationalize, their, aversion, to, a, particular, group, by, appeal, to, rules, or, stereotypes, people, who, behave, in, an, aversively, racial, way, may, profess, egalitarian, beliefs, and, will, often, deny, their, racially, motivated, behavior, nevertheless, they, change, their, behavior, when, dealing, with, a, member, of, another, race, or, ethnic, group, than, the, one, they, belong, to, the, motivation, for, the, change, is, thought, to, be, implicit, or, subconscious, experiments, have, provided, empirical, support, for, the, existence, of, aversive, racism, aversive, racism, has, been, shown, to, have, potentially, serious, implications, for, decision, making, in, employment, in, legal, decisions, and, in, helping, behavior, in, relation, to, racism, color, blindness, is, the, disregard, of, racial, characteristics, in, social, interaction, for, example, in, the, rejection, of, affirmative, action, as, a, way, to, address, the, results, of, past, patterns, of, discrimination, critics, of, this, attitude, argue, that, by, refusing, to, attend, to, racial, disparities, racial, color, blindness, in, fact, unconsciously, perpetuates, the, patterns, that, produce, racial, inequality, eduardo, bonilla, silva, argues, that, color, blind, racism, arises, from, an, abstract, liberalism, biologization, of, culture, naturalization, of, racial, matters, and, minimization, of, racism, color, blind, practices, are, subtle, institutional, and, apparently, nonracial, because, race, is, explicitly, ignored, in, decision, making, if, race, is, disregarded, in, predominantly, white, populations, for, example, whiteness, becomes, the, normative, standard, whereas, people, of, color, are, othered, and, the, racism, these, individuals, experience, may, be, minimized, or, erased, at, an, individual, level, people, with, color, blind, prejudice, reject, racist, ideology, but, also, reject, systemic, policies, intended, to, fix, institutional, racism, cultural, racism, manifests, as, societal, beliefs, and, customs, that, promote, the, assumption, that, the, products, of, a, given, culture, including, the, language, and, traditions, of, that, culture, are, superior, to, those, of, other, cultures, it, shares, a, great, deal, with, xenophobia, which, is, often, characterized, by, fear, of, or, aggression, toward, members, of, an, outgroup, by, members, of, an, ingroup, in, that, sense, it, is, also, similar, to, communalism, as, used, in, south, asia, cultural, racism, exists, when, there, is, a, widespread, acceptance, of, stereotypes, concerning, diverse, ethnic, or, population, groups, whereas, racism, can, be, characterised, by, the, belief, that, one, race, is, inherently, superior, to, another, cultural, racism, can, be, characterised, by, the, belief, that, one, culture, is, inherently, superior, to, another, historical, economic, or, social, disparity, is, alleged, to, be, a, form, of, discrimination, caused, by, past, racism, and, historical, reasons, affecting, the, present, generation, through, deficits, in, the, formal, education, and, kinds, of, preparation, in, previous, generations, and, through, primarily, unconscious, racist, attitudes, and, actions, on, members, of, the, general, population, some, view, that, capitalism, generally, transformed, racism, depending, on, local, circumstances, but, racism, is, not, necessary, for, capitalism, economic, discrimination, may, lead, to, choices, that, perpetuate, racism, for, example, color, photographic, film, was, tuned, for, white, skin, as, are, automatic, soap, dispensers, and, facial, recognition, systems, institutional, racism, also, known, as, structural, racism, state, racism, or, systemic, racism, is, racial, discrimination, by, governments, corporations, religions, or, educational, institutions, or, other, large, organizations, with, the, power, to, influence, the, lives, of, many, individuals, stokely, carmichael, is, credited, for, coining, the, phrase, institutional, racism, in, the, late, 1960s, he, defined, the, term, as, the, collective, failure, of, an, organization, to, provide, an, appropriate, and, professional, service, to, people, because, of, their, colour, culture, or, ethnic, origin, maulana, karenga, argued, that, racism, constituted, the, destruction, of, culture, language, religion, and, human, possibility, and, that, the, effects, of, racism, were, the, morally, monstrous, destruction, of, human, possibility, involved, redefining, african, humanity, to, the, world, poisoning, past, present, and, future, relations, with, others, who, only, know, us, through, this, stereotyping, and, thus, damaging, the, truly, human, relations, among, peoples, othering, is, the, term, used, by, some, to, describe, a, system, of, discrimination, whereby, the, characteristics, of, a, group, are, used, to, distinguish, them, as, separate, from, the, norm, othering, plays, a, fundamental, role, in, the, history, and, continuation, of, racism, to, objectify, a, culture, as, something, different, exotic, or, underdeveloped, is, to, generalize, that, it, is, not, like, normal, society, europe, s, colonial, attitude, towards, the, orientals, exemplifies, this, as, it, was, thought, that, the, east, was, the, opposite, of, the, west, feminine, where, the, west, was, masculine, weak, where, the, west, was, strong, and, traditional, where, the, west, was, progressive, by, making, these, generalizations, and, othering, the, east, europe, was, simultaneously, defining, herself, as, the, norm, further, entrenching, the, gap, much, of, the, process, of, othering, relies, on, imagined, difference, or, the, expectation, of, difference, spatial, difference, can, be, enough, to, conclude, that, we, are, here, and, the, others, are, over, there, imagined, differences, serve, to, categorize, people, into, groups, and, assign, them, characteristics, that, suit, the, imaginer, s, expectations, racial, discrimination, refers, to, discrimination, against, someone, on, the, basis, of, their, race, racial, segregation, is, the, separation, of, humans, into, socially, constructed, racial, groups, in, daily, life, it, may, apply, to, activities, such, as, eating, in, a,

but, may, exist, through, social, norms, even, when, there, is, no, strong, individual, preference, for, it, as, suggested, by, thomas, schelling, s, models, of, segregation, and, subsequent, work, centuries, of, european, colonialism, in, the, americas, africa, and, asia, were, often, justified, by, white, supremacist, attitudes, during, the, early, 20th, century, the, phrase, the, white, man, s, burden, was, widely, used, to, justify, an, imperialist, policy, as, a, noble, enterprise, a, justification, for, the, policy, of, conquest, and, subjugation, of, native, americans, emanated, from, the, stereotyped, perceptions, of, the, indigenous, people, as, merciless, indian, savages, as, they, are, described, in, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, sam, wolfson, of, the, guardian, writes, that, the, declaration, s, passage, has, often, been, cited, as, an, encapsulation, of, the, dehumanizing, attitude, toward, indigenous, americans, that, the, us, was, founded, on, in, an, 1890, article, about, colonial, expansion, onto, native, american, land, author, l, frank, baum, wrote, the, whites, by, law, of, conquest, by, justice, of, civilization, are, masters, of, the, american, continent, and, the, best, safety, of, the, frontier, settlements, will, be, secured, by, the, total, annihilation, of, the, few, remaining, indians, in, his, notes, on, the, state, of, virginia, published, in, 1785, thomas, jefferson, wrote, blacks, whether, originally, a, distinct, race, or, made, distinct, by, time, or, circumstances, are, inferior, to, the, whites, in, the, endowments, of, both, body, and, mind, attitudes, of, black, supremacy, arab, supremacy, and, east, asian, supremacy, also, exist, some, scholars, argue, that, in, the, us, earlier, violent, and, aggressive, forms, of, racism, have, evolved, into, a, more, subtle, form, of, prejudice, in, the, late, 20th, century, this, new, form, of, racism, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, modern, racism, and, it, is, characterized, by, outwardly, acting, unprejudiced, while, inwardly, maintaining, prejudiced, attitudes, displaying, subtle, prejudiced, behaviors, such, as, actions, informed, by, attributing, qualities, to, others, based, on, racial, stereotypes, and, evaluating, the, same, behavior, differently, based, on, the, race, of, the, person, being, evaluated, this, view, is, based, on, studies, of, prejudice, and, discriminatory, behavior, where, some, people, will, act, ambivalently, towards, black, people, with, positive, reactions, in, certain, more, public, contexts, but, more, negative, views, and, expressions, in, more, private, contexts, this, ambivalence, may, also, be, visible, for, example, in, hiring, decisions, where, job, candidates, that, are, otherwise, positively, evaluated, may, be, unconsciously, disfavored, by, employers, in, the, final, decision, because, of, their, race, some, scholars, consider, modern, racism, to, be, characterized, by, an, explicit, rejection, of, stereotypes, combined, with, resistance, to, changing, structures, of, discrimination, for, reasons, that, are, ostensibly, non, racial, an, ideology, that, considers, opportunity, at, a, purely, individual, basis, denying, the, relevance, of, race, in, determining, individual, opportunities, and, the, exhibition, of, indirect, forms, of, micro, aggression, toward, and, or, avoidance, of, people, of, other, races, recent, research, has, shown, that, individuals, who, consciously, claim, to, reject, racism, may, still, exhibit, race, based, subconscious, biases, in, their, decision, making, processes, while, such, subconscious, racial, biases, do, not, fully, fit, the, definition, of, racism, their, impact, can, be, similar, though, typically, less, pronounced, not, being, explicit, conscious, or, deliberate, in, 1919, a, proposal, to, include, a, racial, equality, provision, in, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, was, supported, by, a, majority, but, not, adopted, in, the, paris, peace, conference, in, 1919, in, 1943, japan, and, its, allies, declared, work, for, the, abolition, of, racial, discrimination, to, be, their, aim, at, the, greater, east, asia, conference, article, 1, of, the, 1945, un, charter, includes, promoting, and, encouraging, respect, for, human, rights, and, for, fundamental, freedoms, for, all, without, distinction, as, to, race, as, un, purpose, in, 1950, unesco, suggested, in, the, race, question, a, statement, signed, by, 21, scholars, such, as, ashley, montagu, claude, l, vi, strauss, gunnar, myrdal, julian, huxley, etc, to, drop, the, term, race, altogether, and, instead, speak, of, ethnic, groups, the, statement, condemned, scientific, racism, theories, that, had, played, a, role, in, the, holocaust, it, aimed, both, at, debunking, scientific, racist, theories, by, popularizing, modern, knowledge, concerning, the, race, question, and, morally, condemned, racism, as, contrary, to, the, philosophy, of, the, enlightenment, and, its, assumption, of, equal, rights, for, all, along, with, myrdal, s, an, american, dilemma, the, negro, problem, and, modern, democracy, 1944, the, race, question, influenced, the, 1954, u, s, supreme, court, desegregation, decision, in, brown, v, board, of, education, also, in, 1950, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, was, adopted, which, was, widely, used, on, racial, discrimination, issues, the, united, nations, use, the, definition, of, racial, discrimination, laid, out, in, the, international, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, racial, discrimination, adopted, in, 1966, any, distinction, exclusion, restriction, or, preference, based, on, race, color, descent, or, national, or, ethnic, origin, that, has, the, purpose, or, effect, of, nullifying, or, impairing, the, recognition, enjoyment, or, exercise, on, an, equal, footing, of, human, rights, and, fundamental, freedoms, in, the, political, economic, social, cultural, or, any, other, field, of, public, life, part, 1, of, article, 1, of, the, u, n, international, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, racial, discrimination, in, 2001, the, european, union, explicitly, banned, racism, along, with, many, other, forms, of, social, discrimination, in, the, charter, of, fundamental, rights, of, the, european, union, the, legal, effect, of, which, if, any, would, necessarily, be, limited, to, institutions, of, the, european, union, article, 21, of, the, charter, prohibits, discrimination, on, any, ground, such, as, race, color, ethnic, or, social, origin, genetic, features, language, religion, or, belief, political, or, any, other, opinion, membership, of, a, national, minority, property, disability, age, or, sexual, orientation, and, also, discrimination, on, the, grounds, of, nationality, racism, existed, during, the, 19th, century, as, scientific, racism, which, attempted, to, provide, a, racial, classification, of, humanity, in, 1775, johann, blumenbach, divided, the, world, s, population, into, five, groups, according, to, skin, color, caucasians, mongols, etc, positing, the, view, that, the, non, caucasians, had, arisen, through, a, process, of, degeneration, another, early, view, in, scientific, racism, was, the, polygenist, view, which, held, that, the, different, races, had, been, separately, created, polygenist, christoph, meiners, 1747, may, 1810, for, example, split, mankind, into, two, divisions, which, he, labeled, the, beautiful, white, race, and, the, ugly, black, race, in, meiners, book, the, outline, of, history, of, mankind, he, claimed, that, a, main, characteristic, of, race, is, either, beauty, or, ugliness, he, viewed, only, the, white, race, as, beautiful, he, considered, ugly, races, to, be, inferior, immoral, and, animal, like, anders, retzius, 1796, 1860, demonstrated, that, neither, europeans, nor, others, are, one, pure, race, but, of, mixed, origins, while, discredited, derivations, of, blumenbach, s, taxonomy, are, still, widely, used, for, the, classification, of, the, population, in, the, united, states, hans, peder, steensby, while, strongly, emphasizing, that, all, humans, today, are, of, mixed, origins, in, 1907, claimed, that, the, origins, of, human, differences, must, be, traced, extraordinarily, far, back, in, time, and, conjectured, that, the, purest, race, today, would, be, the, australian, aboriginals, scientific, racism, fell, strongly, out, of, favor, in, the, early, 20th, century, but, the, origins, of, fundamental, human, and, societal, differences, are, still, researched, within, academia, in, fields, such, as, human, genetics, including, paleogenetics, social, anthropology, comparative, politics, history, of, religions, history, of, ideas, prehistory, history, ethics, and, psychiatry, there, is, widespread, rejection, of, any, methodology, based, on, anything, similar, to, blumenbach, s, races, it, is, more, unclear, to, which, extent, and, when, ethnic, and, national, stereotypes, are, accepted, although, after, world, war, ii, and, the, holocaust, racist, ideologies, were, discredited, on, ethical, political, and, scientific, grounds, racism, and, racial, discrimination, have, remained, widespread, around, the, world, du, bois, observed, that, it, is, not, so, much, race, that, we, think, about, but, culture, a, common, history, common, laws, and, religion, similar, habits, of, thought, and, a, conscious, striving, together, for, certain, ideals, of, life, late, 19th, century, nationalists, were, the, first, to, embrace, contemporary, discourses, on, race, ethnicity, and, survival, of, the, fittest, to, shape, new, nationalist, doctrines, ultimately, race, came, to, represent, not, only, the, most, important, traits, of, the, human, body, but, was, also, regarded, as, decisively, shaping, the, character, and, personality, of, the, nation, according, to, this, view, culture, is, the, physical, manifestation, created, by, ethnic, groupings, as, such, fully, determined, by, racial, characteristics, culture, and, race, became, considered, intertwined, and, dependent, upon, each, other, sometimes, even, to, the, extent, of, including, nationality, or, language, to, the, set, of, definition, pureness, of, race, tended, to, be, related, to, rather, superficial, characteristics, that, were, easily, addressed, and, advertised, such, as, blondness, racial, qualities, tended, to, be, related, to, nationality, and, language, rather, than, the, actual, geographic, distribution, of, racial, characteristics, in, the, case, of, nordicism, the, denomination, germanic, was, equivalent, to, superiority, of, race, bolstered, by, some, nationalist, and, ethnocentric, values, and, achievements, of, choice, this, concept, of, racial, superiority, evolved, to, distinguish, from, other, cultures, that, were, considered, inferior, or, impure, this, emphasis, on, culture, corresponds, to, the, modern, mainstream, definition, of, racism, acism, does, not, originate, from, the, existence, of, races, it, creates, them, through, a, process, of, social, division, into, categories, anybody, can, be, racialised, independently, of, their, somatic, cultural, religious, differences, this, definition, explicitly, ignores, the, biological, concept, of, race, which, is, still, subject, to, scientific, debate, in, the, words, of, david, c, rowe, racial, concept, although, sometimes, in, the, guise, of, another, name, will, remain, in, use, in, biology, and, in, other, fields, because, scientists, as, well, as, lay, persons, are, fascinated, by, human, diversity, some, of, which, is, captured, by, race, racial, prejudice, became, subject, to, international, legislation, for, instance, the, declaration, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, racial, discrimination, adopted, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, on, november, 20, 1963, addresses, racial, prejudice, explicitly, next, to, discrimination, for, reasons, of, race, colour, or, ethnic, origin, article, i, debates, over, the, origins, of, racism, often, suffer, from, a, lack, of, clarity, over, the, term, many, use, the, term, racism, to, refer, to, more, general, phenomena, such, as, xenophobia, and, ethnocentrism, although, scholars, attempt, to, clearly, distinguish, those, phenomena, from, racism, as, an, ideology, or, from, scientific, racism, which, has, little, to, do, with, ordinary, xenophobia, others, conflate, recent, forms, of, racism, with, earlier, forms, of, ethnic, and, national, conflict, in, most, cases, ethno, national, conflict, seems, to, owe, itself, to, conflict, over, land, and, strategic, resources, in, some, cases, ethnicity, and, nationalism, were, harnessed, in, order, to, rally, combatants, in, wars, between, great, religious, empires, for, example, the, muslim, turks, and, the, catholic, austro, hungarians, notions, of, race, and, racism, have, often, played, central, roles, in, ethnic, conflicts, throughout, history, when, an, adversary, is, identified, as, other, based, on, notions, of, race, or, ethnicity, in, particular, when, other, is, interpreted, to, mean, inferior, the, means, employed, by, the, self, presumed, superior, party, to, appropriate, territory, human, chattel, or, material, wealth, often, have, been, more, ruthless, more, brutal, and, less, constrained, by, moral, or, ethical, considerations, according, to, historian, daniel, richter, pontiac, s, rebellion, saw, the, emergence, on, both, sides, of, the, conflict, of, the, novel, idea, that, all, native, people, were, indians, that, all, euro, americans, were, whites, and, that, all, on, one, side, must, unite, to, destroy, the, other, basil, davidson, states, in, his, documentary, africa, different, but, equal, that, racism, in, fact, only, just, recently, surfaced, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, due, to, the, need, for, a, justification, for, slavery, in, the, americas, historically, racism, was, a, major, driving, force, behind, the, transatlantic, slave, trade, it, was, also, a, major, force, behind, racial, segregation, especially, in, the, united, states, in, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, and, south, africa, under, apartheid, 19th, and, 20th, century, racism, in, the, western, world, is, particularly, well, documented, and, constitutes, a, reference, point, in, studies, and, discourses, about, racism, racism, has, played, a, role, in, genocides, such, as, the, armenian, genocide, and, the, holocaust, and, colonial, projects, like, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, africa, and, asia, indigenous, peoples, have, been, and, are, often, subject, to, racist, attitudes, practices, and, ideologies, of, racism, are, condemned, by, the, united, nations, in, the, declaration, of, human, rights, after, the, napoleonic, wars, europe, was, confronted, with, the, new, nationalities, question, leading, to, reconfigurations, of, the, european, map, on, which, the, frontiers, between, the, states, had, been, delineated, during, the, 1648, peace, of, westphalia, nationalism, had, made, its, first, appearance, with, the, invention, of, the, lev, e, en, masse, by, the, french, revolutionaries, thus, inventing, mass, conscription, in, order, to, be, able, to, defend, the, newly, founded, republic, against, the, ancien, r, gime, order, represented, by, the, european, monarchies, this, led, to, the, french, revolutionary, wars, 1792, 1802, and, then, to, the, conquests, of, napoleon, and, to, the, subsequent, european, wide, debates, on, the, concepts, and, realities, of, nations, and, in, particular, of, nation, states, the, westphalia, treaty, had, divided, europe, into, various, empires, and, kingdoms, such, as, the, ottoman, empire, the, holy, roman, empire, the, swedish, empire, the, kingdom, of, france, etc, and, for, centuries, wars, were, waged, between, princes, kabinettskriege, in, german, modern, nation, states, appeared, in, the, wake, of, the, french, revolution, with, the, formation, of, patriotic, sentiments, for, the, first, time, in, spain, during, the, peninsula, war, 1808, 1813, known, in, spain, as, the, independence, war, despite, the, restoration, of, the, previous, order, with, the, 1815, congress, of, vienna, the, nationalities, question, became, the, main, problem, of, europe, during, the, industrial, era, leading, in, particular, to, the, 1848, revolutions, the, italian, unification, completed, during, the, 1871, franco, prussian, war, which, itself, culminated, in, the, proclamation, of, the, german, empire, in, the, hall, of, mirrors, in, the, palace, of, versailles, thus, achieving, the, german, unification, meanwhile, the, ottoman, empire, the, sick, man, of, europe, was, confronted, with, endless, nationalist, movements, which, along, with, the, dissolving, of, the, austrian, hungarian, empire, would, lead, to, the, creation, after, world, war, i, of, the, various, nation, states, of, the, balkans, with, national, minorities, in, their, borders, ethnic, nationalism, which, advocated, the, belief, in, a, hereditary, membership, of, the, nation, made, its, appearance, in, the, historical, context, surrounding, the, creation, of, the, modern, nation, states, one, of, its, main, influences, was, the, romantic, nationalist, movement, at, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, represented, by, figures, such, as, johann, herder, 1744, 1803, johan, fichte, 1762, 1814, in, the, addresses, to, the, german, nation, 1808, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, or, also, in, france, jules, michelet, 1798, 1874, it, was, opposed, to, liberal, nationalism, represented, by, authors, such, as, ernest, renan, 1823, 1892, who, conceived, of, the, nation, as, a, community, which, instead, of, being, based, on, the, volk, ethnic, group, and, on, a, specific, common, language, was, founded, on, the, subjective, will, to, live, together, the, nation, is, a, daily, plebiscite, 1882, or, also, john, stuart, mill, 1806, 1873, ethnic, nationalism, blended, with, scientific, racist, discourses, as, well, as, with, continental, imperialist, hannah, arendt, 1951, discourses, for, example, in, the, pan, germanism, discourses, which, postulated, the, racial, superiority, of, the, german, volk, people, folk, the, pan, german, league, alldeutscher, verband, created, in, 1891, promoted, german, imperialism, and, racial, hygiene, and, was, opposed, to, intermarriage, with, jews, another, popular, current, the, v, lkisch, movement, was, also, an, important, proponent, of, the, german, ethnic, nationalist, discourse, and, it, combined, pan, germanism, with, modern, racial, antisemitism, members, of, the, v, lkisch, movement, in, particular, the, thule, society, would, participate, in, the, founding, of, the, german, workers, party, dap, in, munich, in, 1918, the, predecessor, of, the, nazi, party, pan, germanism, played, a, decisive, role, in, the, interwar, period, of, the, 1920s, 1930s, these, currents, began, to, associate, the, idea, of, the, nation, with, the, biological, concept, of, a, master, race, often, the, aryan, race, or, the, nordic, race, issued, from, the, scientific, racist, discourse, they, conflated, nationalities, with, ethnic, groups, called, races, in, a, radical, distinction, from, previous, racial, discourses, that, posited, the, existence, of, a, race, struggle, inside, the, nation, and, the, state, itself, furthermore, they, believed, that, political, boundaries, should, mirror, these, alleged, racial, and, ethnic, groups, thus, justifying, ethnic, cleansing, in, order, to, achieve, racial, purity, and, also, to, achieve, ethnic, homogeneity, in, the, nation, state, such, racist, discourses, combined, with, nationalism, were, not, however, limited, to, pan, germanism, in, france, the, transition, from, republican, liberal, nationalism, to, ethnic, nationalism, which, made, nationalism, a, characteristic, of, far, right, movements, in, france, took, place, during, the, dreyfus, affair, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, during, several, years, a, nationwide, crisis, affected, french, society, concerning, the, alleged, treason, of, alfred, dreyfus, a, french, jewish, military, officer, the, country, polarized, itself, into, two, opposite, camps, one, represented, by, mile, zola, who, wrote, j, accuse, in, defense, of, alfred, dreyfus, and, the, other, represented, by, the, nationalist, poet, maurice, barr, s, 1862, 1923, one, of, the, founders, of, the, ethnic, nationalist, discourse, in, france, at, the, same, time, charles, maurras, 1868, 1952, founder, of, the, monarchist, action, fran, aise, movement, theorized, the, anti, france, composed, of, the, four, confederate, states, of, protestants, jews, freemasons, and, foreigners, his, actual, word, for, the, latter, being, the, pejorative, m, t, ques, indeed, to, him, the, first, three, were, all, internal, foreigners, who, threatened, the, ethnic, unity, of, the, french, people, bernard, lewis, has, cited, the, greek, philosopher, aristotle, who, in, his, discussion, of, slavery, stated, that, while, greeks, are, free, by, nature, barbarians, non, greeks, are, slaves, by, nature, in, that, it, is, in, their, nature, to, be, more, willing, to, submit, to, a, despotic, government, though, aristotle, does, not, specify, any, particular, races, he, argues, that, people, from, nations, outside, greece, are, more, prone, to, the, burden, of, slavery, than, those, from, greece, while, aristotle, makes, remarks, about, the, most, natural, slaves, being, those, with, strong, bodies, and, slave, souls, unfit, for, rule, unintelligent, which, would, seem, to, imply, a, physical, basis, for, discrimination, he, also, explicitly, states, that, the, right, kind, of, souls, and, bodies, do, not, always, go, together, implying, that, the, greatest, determinate, for, inferiority, and, natural, slaves, versus, natural, masters, is, the, soul, not, the, body, some, of, earliest, anti, jewish, racism, can, be, documented, to, the, 3rd, century, bce, in, alexandria, and, one, of, the, earliest, documented, anti, jewish, edicts, to, 170, 167, bce, this, proto, racism, is, seen, as, an, important, precursor, to, modern, racism, by, classicist, benjamin, isaac, such, proto, racism, and, ethnocentrism, must, be, looked, at, within, context, because, a, modern, understanding, of, racism, based, on, hereditary, inferiority, with, modern, racism, based, on, eugenics, and, scientific, racism, was, not, yet, developed, and, it, is, unclear, whether, aristotle, believed, the, natural, inferiority, of, barbarians, was, caused, by, environment, and, climate, like, many, of, his, contemporaries, or, by, birth, historian, dante, a, puzzo, in, his, discussion, of, aristotle, racism, and, the, ancient, world, writes, that, racism, rests, on, two, basic, assumptions, that, a, correlation, exists, between, physical, characteristics, and, moral, qualities, that, mankind, is, divisible, into, superior, and, inferior, stocks, racism, thus, defined, is, a, modern, conception, for, prior, to, the, xvith, century, there, was, virtually, nothing, in, the, life, and, thought, of, the, west, that, can, be, described, as, racist, to, prevent, misunderstanding, a, clear, distinction, must, be, made, between, racism, and, ethnocentrism, the, ancient, hebrews, in, referring, to, all, who, were, not, hebrews, as, gentiles, were, indulging, in, ethnocentrism, not, in, racism, so, it, was, with, the, hellenes, who, denominated, all, non, hellenes, whether, the, wild, scythians, or, the, egyptians, whom, they, acknowledged, as, their, mentors, in, the, arts, of, civilization, barbarians, the, term, denoting, that, which, was, strange, or, foreign, bernard, lewis, has, also, cited, historians, and, geographers, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, region, including, al, muqaddasi, al, jahiz, al, masudi, abu, rayhan, biruni, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, and, ibn, qutaybah, though, the, qur, an, expresses, no, racial, prejudice, lewis, argues, that, ethnocentric, prejudice, later, developed, among, arabs, for, a, variety, of, reasons, their, extensive, conquests, and, slave, trade, the, influence, of, aristotelian, ideas, regarding, slavery, which, some, muslim, philosophers, directed, towards, zanj, bantu, and, turkic, peoples, and, the, influence, of, judeo, christian, ideas, regarding, divisions, among, humankind, by, the, eighth, century, anti, black, prejudice, among, arabs, resulted, in, discrimination, a, number, of, medieval, arabic, authors, argued, against, this, prejudice, urging, respect, for, all, black, people, and, especially, ethiopians, by, the, 14th, century, a, significant, number, of, slaves, came, from, sub, saharan, africa, lewis, argues, that, this, led, to, the, likes, of, egyptian, historian, al, abshibi, 1388, 1446, writing, that, t, is, said, that, when, the, slave, is, sated, he, fornicates, when, he, is, hungry, he, steals, according, to, lewis, the, 14th, century, tunisian, scholar, ibn, khaldun, also, wrote, beyond, to, the, south, there, is, no, civilization, in, the, proper, sense, there, are, only, humans, who, are, closer, to, dumb, animals, than, to, rational, beings, they, live, in, thickets, and, caves, and, eat, herbs, and, unprepared, grain, they, frequently, eat, each, other, they, cannot, be, considered, human, beings, therefore, the, negro, nations, are, as, a, rule, submissive, to, slavery, because, negroes, have, little, that, is, essentially, human, and, possess, attributes, that, are, quite, similar, to, those, of, dumb, animals, as, we, have, stated, according, to, wesleyan, university, professor, abdelmajid, hannoum, french, orientalists, projected, racist, and, colonialist, views, of, the, 19th, century, into, their, translations, of, medieval, arabic, writings, including, those, of, ibn, khaldun, this, resulted, in, the, translated, texts, racializing, arabs, and, berber, people, when, no, such, distinction, was, made, in, the, originals, james, e, lindsay, argues, that, the, concept, of, an, arab, identity, itself, did, not, exist, until, modern, times, though, others, like, robert, hoyland, have, argued, that, a, common, sense, of, arab, identity, already, existed, by, the, 9th, century, with, the, umayyad, caliphate, s, conquest, of, hispania, muslim, arabs, and, berbers, overthrew, the, previous, visigothic, rulers, and, created, al, andalus, which, contributed, to, the, golden, age, of, jewish, culture, and, lasted, for, six, centuries, it, was, followed, by, the, centuries, long, reconquista, during, which, christian, iberian, kingdoms, contested, al, andalus, and, progressively, conquered, the, divided, muslim, kingdoms, culminating, in, the, fall, of, the, nasrid, kingdom, of, granada, in, 1492, and, the, rise, of, ferdinand, v, and, isabella, i, as, catholic, monarchs, of, spain, the, legacy, catholic, spaniards, then, formulated, the, limpieza, de, sangre, cleanliness, of, blood, doctrine, it, was, during, this, time, in, history, that, the, western, concept, of, aristocratic, blue, blood, emerged, in, a, racialized, religious, and, feudal, context, so, as, to, stem, the, upward, social, mobility, of, the, converted, new, christians, robert, lacey, explains, it, was, the, spaniards, who, gave, the, world, the, notion, that, an, aristocrat, s, blood, is, not, red, but, blue, the, spanish, nobility, started, taking, shape, around, the, ninth, century, in, classic, military, fashion, occupying, land, as, warriors, on, horseback, they, were, to, continue, the, process, for, more, than, five, hundred, years, clawing, back, sections, of, the, peninsula, from, its, moorish, occupiers, and, a, nobleman, demonstrated, his, pedigree, by, holding, up, his, sword, arm, to, display, the, filigree, of, blue, blooded, veins, beneath, his, pale, skin, proof, that, his, birth, had, not, been, contaminated, by, the, dark, skinned, enemy, sangre, azul, blue, blood, was, thus, a, euphemism, for, being, a, white, man, spain, s, own, particular, reminder, that, the, refined, footsteps, of, the, aristocracy, through, history, carry, the, rather, less, refined, spoor, of, racism, following, the, expulsion, of, the, arabic, moors, and, most, of, the, sephardic, jews, from, the, iberian, peninsula, the, remaining, jews, and, muslims, were, forced, to, convert, to, roman, catholicism, becoming, new, christians, who, were, sometimes, discriminated, against, by, the, old, christians, in, some, cities, including, toledo, despite, condemnations, by, the, church, and, the, state, which, both, welcomed, the, new, flock, the, inquisition, was, carried, out, by, members, of, the, dominican, order, in, order, to, weed, out, the, converts, who, still, practiced, judaism, and, islam, in, secret, the, system, and, ideology, of, the, limpieza, de, sangre, ostracized, false, christian, converts, from, society, in, order, to, protect, it, against, treason, the, remnants, of, such, legislation, persevered, into, the, 19th, century, in, military, contexts, in, portugal, the, legal, distinction, between, new, and, old, christian, was, only, ended, through, a, legal, decree, issued, by, the, marquis, of, pombal, in, 1772, almost, three, centuries, after, the, implementation, of, the, racist, discrimination, the, limpieza, de, sangre, legislation, was, common, also, during, the, colonization, of, the, americas, where, it, led, to, the, racial, and, feudal, separation, of, peoples, and, social, strata, in, the, colonies, it, was, however, often, ignored, in, practice, as, the, new, colonies, needed, skilled, people, at, the, end, of, the, renaissance, the, valladolid, debate, 1550, 1551, concerning, the, treatment, of, the, natives, of, the, new, world, pitted, the, dominican, friar, and, bishop, of, chiapas, bartolom, de, las, casas, to, another, dominican, and, humanist, philosopher, juan, gin, s, de, sep, lveda, the, latter, argued, that, the, indians, practiced, human, sacrifice, of, innocents, cannibalism, and, other, such, crimes, against, nature, they, were, unacceptable, and, should, be, suppressed, by, any, means, possible, including, war, thus, reducing, them, to, slavery, or, serfdom, was, in, accordance, with, catholic, theology, and, natural, law, to, the, contrary, bartolom, de, las, casas, argued, that, the, amerindians, were, free, men, in, the, natural, order, and, deserved, the, same, treatment, as, others, according, to, catholic, theology, it, was, one, of, the, many, controversies, concerning, racism, slavery, religion, and, european, morality, that, would, arise, in, the, following, centuries, and, which, resulted, in, the, legislation, protecting, the, natives, in, the, spanish, colonies, spaniards, developed, a, complex, caste, system, based, on, race, which, was, used, for, social, control, and, which, also, determined, a, person, s, importance, in, society, while, many, latin, american, countries, have, long, since, rendered, the, system, officially, illegal, through, legislation, usually, at, the, time, of, their, independence, prejudice, based, on, degrees, of, perceived, racial, distance, from, european, ancestry, combined, with, one, s, socioeconomic, status, remain, an, echo, of, the, colonial, caste, system, racism, is, frequently, described, as, a, modern, phenomenon, in, the, view, of, the, french, philosopher, and, historian, michel, foucault, the, first, formulation, of, racism, emerged, in, the, early, modern, period, as, the, discourse, of, race, struggle, and, a, historical, and, political, discourse, which, foucault, opposed, to, the, philosophical, and, juridical, discourse, of, sovereignty, this, european, discourse, which, first, appeared, in, great, britain, was, then, carried, on, in, france, by, such, people, as, boulainvilliers, 1658, 1722, nicolas, fr, ret, 1688, 1749, and, then, during, the, 1789, french, revolution, siey, s, and, afterwards, augustin, thierry, and, cournot, boulainvilliers, who, created, the, matrix, of, such, racist, discourse, in, france, conceived, of, the, race, as, being, something, closer, to, the, sense, of, a, nation, that, is, in, his, time, the, race, meant, the, people, he, conceived, of, france, as, being, divided, between, various, nations, the, unified, nation, state, is, an, anachronism, here, which, themselves, formed, different, races, boulainvilliers, opposed, the, absolute, monarchy, which, tried, to, bypass, the, aristocracy, by, establishing, a, direct, relationship, to, the, third, estate, thus, he, developed, the, theory, that, the, french, aristocrats, were, the, descendants, of, foreign, invaders, whom, he, called, the, franks, while, according, to, him, the, third, estate, constituted, the, autochthonous, vanquished, gallo, romans, who, were, dominated, by, the, frankish, aristocracy, as, a, consequence, of, the, right, of, conquest, early, modern, racism, was, opposed, to, nationalism, and, the, nation, state, the, comte, de, montlosier, in, exile, during, the, french, revolution, who, borrowed, boulainvilliers, discourse, on, the, nordic, race, as, being, the, french, aristocracy, that, invaded, the, plebeian, gauls, thus, showed, his, contempt, for, the, third, estate, calling, it, this, new, people, born, of, slaves, mixture, of, all, races, and, of, all, times, while, 19th, century, racism, became, closely, intertwined, with, nationalism, leading, to, the, ethnic, nationalist, discourse, that, identified, the, race, with, the, folk, leading, to, such, movements, as, pan, germanism, pan, turkism, pan, arabism, and, pan, slavism, medieval, racism, precisely, divided, the, nation, into, various, non, biological, races, which, were, thought, to, be, the, consequence, of, historical, conquests, and, social, conflicts, michel, foucault, traced, the, genealogy, of, modern, racism, to, this, medieval, historical, and, political, discourse, of, race, struggle, according, to, him, it, divided, itself, in, the, 19th, century, according, to, two, rival, lines, on, one, hand, it, was, incorporated, by, racists, biologists, and, eugenicists, who, gave, it, the, modern, sense, of, race, and, they, also, transformed, this, popular, discourse, into, a, state, racism, e, g, nazism, on, the, other, hand, marxism, also, seized, this, discourse, founded, on, the, assumption, of, a, political, struggle, that, provided, the, real, engine, of, history, and, continued, to, act, underneath, the, apparent, peace, thus, marxists, transformed, the, essentialist, notion, of, race, into, the, historical, notion, of, class, struggle, defined, by, socially, structured, positions, capitalist, or, proletarian, in, the, will, to, knowledge, 1976, foucault, analyzed, another, opponent, of, the, race, struggle, discourse, sigmund, freud, s, psychoanalysis, which, opposed, the, concept, of, blood, heredity, prevalent, in, the, 19th, century, racist, discourse, authors, such, as, hannah, arendt, in, her, 1951, book, the, origins, of, totalitarianism, have, said, that, the, racist, ideology, popular, racism, which, developed, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, helped, legitimize, the, imperialist, conquests, of, foreign, territories, and, the, atrocities, that, sometimes, accompanied, them, such, as, the, herero, and, namaqua, genocide, of, 1904, 1907, or, the, armenian, genocide, of, 1915, 1917, rudyard, kipling, s, poem, the, white, man, s, burden, 1899, is, one, of, the, more, famous, illustrations, of, the, belief, in, the, inherent, superiority, of, the, european, culture, over, the, rest, of, the, world, though, it, is, also, thought, to, be, a, satirical, appraisal, of, such, imperialism, racist, ideology, thus, helped, legitimize, the, conquest, and, incorporation, of, foreign, territories, into, an, empire, which, were, regarded, as, a, humanitarian, obligation, partially, as, a, result, of, these, racist, beliefs, however, during, the, 19th, century, western, european, colonial, powers, were, involved, in, the, suppression, of, the, arab, slave, trade, in, africa, as, well, as, in, the, suppression, of, the, slave, trade, in, west, africa, some, europeans, during, the, time, period, objected, to, injustices, that, occurred, in, some, colonies, and, lobbied, on, behalf, of, aboriginal, peoples, thus, when, the, hottentot, venus, was, displayed, in, england, in, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, the, african, association, publicly, opposed, itself, to, the, exhibition, the, same, year, that, kipling, published, his, poem, joseph, conrad, published, heart, of, darkness, 1899, a, clear, criticism, of, the, congo, free, state, which, was, owned, by, leopold, ii, of, belgium, examples, of, racial, theories, used, include, the, creation, of, the, hamitic, theory, during, the, european, exploration, of, africa, the, term, hamite, was, applied, to, different, populations, within, north, africa, mainly, comprising, ethiopians, eritreans, somalis, berbers, and, the, ancient, egyptians, hamites, were, regarded, as, caucasoid, peoples, who, probably, originated, in, either, arabia, or, asia, on, the, basis, of, their, cultural, physical, and, linguistic, similarities, with, the, peoples, of, those, areas, europeans, considered, hamites, to, be, more, civilized, than, sub, saharan, africans, and, more, akin, to, themselves, and, semitic, peoples, in, the, first, two, thirds, of, the, 20th, century, the, hamitic, race, was, in, fact, considered, one, of, the, branches, of, the, caucasian, race, along, with, the, indo, europeans, semites, and, the, mediterraneans, however, the, hamitic, peoples, themselves, were, often, deemed, to, have, failed, as, rulers, which, was, usually, ascribed, to, interbreeding, with, negroes, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, german, scholar, carl, meinhof, 1857, 1944, claimed, that, the, bantu, race, was, formed, by, a, merger, of, hamitic, and, negro, races, the, hottentots, nama, or, khoi, were, formed, by, the, merger, of, hamitic, and, bushmen, san, races, both, being, termed, nowadays, as, khoisan, peoples, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, american, colonization, society, was, established, as, the, primary, vehicle, for, proposals, to, return, black, americans, to, greater, freedom, and, equality, in, africa, the, colonization, effort, resulted, from, a, mixture, of, motives, with, its, founder, henry, clay, stating, that, unconquerable, prejudice, resulting, from, their, color, they, never, could, amalgamate, with, the, free, whites, of, this, country, it, was, desirable, therefore, as, it, respected, them, and, the, residue, of, the, population, of, the, country, to, drain, them, off, racism, spread, throughout, the, new, world, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, whitecapping, which, started, in, indiana, in, the, late, 19th, century, soon, spread, throughout, all, of, north, america, causing, many, african, laborers, to, flee, from, the, land, they, worked, on, in, the, us, during, the, 1860s, racist, posters, were, used, during, election, campaigns, in, one, of, these, racist, posters, see, above, a,

that, this, separation, of, races, continues, to, exist, de, facto, today, in, different, forms, such, as, lack, of, access, to, loans, and, resources, or, discrimination, by, police, and, other, government, officials, the, 2016, pew, research, poll, found, that, italians, in, particular, hold, strong, anti, romani, views, with, 82, of, italians, expressing, negative, opinions, about, romani, in, greece, there, are, 67, in, hungary, 64, in, france, 61, in, spain, 49, in, poland, 47, in, the, uk, 45, in, sweden, 42, in, germany, 40, and, in, the, netherlands, 37, that, have, an, unfavourable, view, of, roma, a, survey, conducted, by, harvard, university, found, the, czech, republic, lithuania, belarus, and, ukraine, had, the, strongest, racial, bias, against, black, people, in, europe, while, serbia, slovenia, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, had, the, weakest, racial, bias, followed, by, croatia, and, ireland, a, 2023, university, of, cambridge, survey, which, featured, the, largest, sample, of, black, people, in, britain, found, that, 88, had, reported, racial, discrimination, at, work, 79, believed, the, police, unfairly, targeted, black, people, with, stop, and, search, powers, and, 80, definitely, or, somewhat, agreed, that, the, biggest, barrier, to, academic, attainment, for, young, black, students, was, racial, discrimination, in, education, the, modern, biological, definition, of, race, developed, in, the, 19th, century, with, scientific, racist, theories, the, term, scientific, racism, refers, to, the, use, of, science, to, justify, and, support, racist, beliefs, which, goes, back, to, the, early, 18th, century, though, it, gained, most, of, its, influence, in, the, mid, 19th, century, during, the, new, imperialism, period, also, known, as, academic, racism, such, theories, first, needed, to, overcome, the, church, s, resistance, to, positivist, accounts, of, history, and, its, support, of, monogenism, the, concept, that, all, human, beings, were, originated, from, the, same, ancestors, in, accordance, with, creationist, accounts, of, history, these, racist, theories, put, forth, on, scientific, hypothesis, were, combined, with, unilineal, theories, of, social, progress, which, postulated, the, superiority, of, the, european, civilization, over, the, rest, of, the, world, furthermore, they, frequently, made, use, of, the, idea, of, survival, of, the, fittest, a, term, coined, by, herbert, spencer, in, 1864, associated, with, ideas, of, competition, which, were, named, social, darwinism, in, the, 1940s, charles, darwin, himself, opposed, the, idea, of, rigid, racial, differences, in, the, descent, of, man, 1871, in, which, he, argued, that, humans, were, all, of, one, species, sharing, common, descent, he, recognised, racial, differences, as, varieties, of, humanity, and, emphasised, the, close, similarities, between, people, of, all, races, in, mental, faculties, tastes, dispositions, and, habits, while, still, contrasting, the, culture, of, the, lowest, savages, with, european, civilization, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, proponents, of, scientific, racism, intertwined, themselves, with, eugenics, discourses, of, degeneration, of, the, race, and, blood, heredity, henceforth, scientific, racist, discourses, could, be, defined, as, the, combination, of, polygenism, unilinealism, social, darwinism, and, eugenism, they, found, their, scientific, legitimacy, on, physical, anthropology, anthropometry, craniometry, phrenology, physiognomy, and, others, now, discredited, disciplines, in, order, to, formulate, racist, prejudices, before, being, disqualified, in, the, 20th, century, by, the, american, school, of, cultural, anthropology, franz, boas, etc, the, british, school, of, social, anthropology, bronis, aw, malinowski, alfred, radcliffe, brown, etc, the, french, school, of, ethnology, claude, l, vi, strauss, etc, as, well, as, the, discovery, of, the, neo, darwinian, synthesis, such, sciences, in, particular, anthropometry, were, used, to, deduce, behaviours, and, psychological, characteristics, from, outward, physical, appearances, the, neo, darwinian, synthesis, first, developed, in, the, 1930s, eventually, led, to, a, gene, centered, view, of, evolution, in, the, 1960s, according, to, the, human, genome, project, the, most, complete, mapping, of, human, dna, to, date, indicates, that, there, is, no, clear, genetic, basis, to, racial, groups, while, some, genes, are, more, common, in, certain, populations, there, are, no, genes, that, exist, in, all, members, of, one, population, and, no, members, of, any, other, the, first, theory, of, eugenics, was, developed, in, 1869, by, francis, galton, 1822, 1911, who, used, the, then, popular, concept, of, degeneration, he, applied, statistics, to, study, human, differences, and, the, alleged, inheritance, of, intelligence, foreshadowing, future, uses, of, intelligence, testing, by, the, anthropometry, school, such, theories, were, vividly, described, by, the, writer, mile, zola, 1840, 1902, who, started, publishing, in, 1871, a, twenty, novel, cycle, les, rougon, macquart, where, he, linked, heredity, to, behavior, thus, zola, described, the, high, born, rougons, as, those, involved, in, politics, son, excellence, eug, ne, rougon, and, medicine, le, docteur, pascal, and, the, low, born, macquarts, as, those, fatally, falling, into, alcoholism, l, assommoir, prostitution, nana, and, homicide, la, b, te, humaine, during, the, rise, of, nazism, in, germany, some, scientists, in, western, nations, worked, to, debunk, the, regime, s, racial, theories, a, few, argued, against, racist, ideologies, and, discrimination, even, if, they, believed, in, the, alleged, existence, of, biological, races, however, in, the, fields, of, anthropology, and, biology, these, were, minority, positions, until, the, mid, 20th, century, according, to, the, 1950, unesco, statement, the, race, question, an, international, project, to, debunk, racist, theories, had, been, attempted, in, the, mid, 1930s, however, this, project, had, been, abandoned, thus, in, 1950, unesco, declared, that, it, had, resumed, up, again, after, a, lapse, of, fifteen, years, a, project, that, the, international, committee, on, intellectual, cooperation, has, wished, to, carry, through, but, that, it, had, to, abandon, in, deference, to, the, appeasement, policy, of, the, pre, war, period, the, race, question, had, become, one, of, the, pivots, of, nazi, ideology, and, policy, masaryk, and, bene, took, the, initiative, of, calling, for, a, conference, to, re, establish, in, the, minds, and, consciences, of, men, everywhere, the, truth, about, race, nazi, propaganda, was, able, to, continue, its, baleful, work, unopposed, by, the, authority, of, an, international, organisation, the, third, reich, s, racial, policies, its, eugenics, programs, and, the, extermination, of, jews, in, the, holocaust, as, well, as, the, romani, people, in, the, porrajmos, the, romani, holocaust, and, others, minorities, led, to, a, change, in, opinions, about, scientific, research, into, race, after, the, war, changes, within, scientific, disciplines, such, as, the, rise, of, the, boasian, school, of, anthropology, in, the, united, states, contributed, to, this, shift, these, theories, were, strongly, denounced, in, the, 1950, unesco, statement, signed, by, internationally, renowned, scholars, and, titled, the, race, question, works, such, as, arthur, de, gobineau, s, an, essay, on, the, inequality, of, the, human, races, 1853, 1855, may, be, considered, one, of, the, first, theorizations, of, this, new, racism, founded, on, an, essentialist, notion, of, race, which, opposed, the, former, racial, discourse, of, boulainvilliers, for, example, which, saw, in, races, a, fundamentally, historical, reality, which, changed, over, time, gobineau, thus, attempted, to, frame, racism, within, the, terms, of, biological, differences, among, humans, giving, it, the, legitimacy, of, biology, gobineau, s, theories, would, be, expanded, in, france, by, georges, vacher, de, lapouge, 1854, 1936, s, typology, of, races, who, published, in, 1899, the, aryan, and, his, social, role, in, which, he, claimed, that, the, white, aryan, race, dolichocephalic, was, opposed, to, the, brachycephalic, race, of, whom, the, jew, was, the, archetype, vacher, de, lapouge, thus, created, a, hierarchical, classification, of, races, in, which, he, identified, the, homo, europaeus, teutonic, protestant, etc, the, homo, alpinus, auvergnat, turkish, etc, and, finally, the, homo, mediterraneus, neapolitan, andalus, etc, he, assimilated, races, and, social, classes, considering, that, the, french, upper, class, was, a, representation, of, the, homo, europaeus, while, the, lower, class, represented, the, homo, alpinus, applying, galton, s, eugenics, to, his, theory, of, races, vacher, de, lapouge, s, selectionism, aimed, first, at, achieving, the, annihilation, of, trade, unionists, considered, to, be, a, degenerate, second, creating, types, of, man, each, destined, to, one, end, in, order, to, prevent, any, contestation, of, labour, conditions, his, anthroposociology, thus, aimed, at, blocking, social, conflict, by, establishing, a, fixed, hierarchical, social, order, the, same, year, william, z, ripley, used, identical, racial, classification, in, the, races, of, europe, 1899, which, would, have, a, great, influence, in, the, united, states, other, scientific, authors, include, h, s, chamberlain, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, british, citizen, who, naturalized, himself, as, german, because, of, his, admiration, for, the, aryan, race, and, madison, grant, a, eugenicist, and, author, of, the, passing, of, the, great, race, 1916, madison, grant, provided, statistics, for, the, immigration, act, of, 1924, which, severely, restricted, immigration, of, jews, slavs, and, southern, europeans, who, were, subsequently, hindered, in, seeking, to, escape, nazi, germany, human, zoos, called, people, shows, were, an, important, means, of, bolstering, popular, racism, by, connecting, it, to, scientific, racism, they, were, both, objects, of, public, curiosity, and, of, anthropology, and, anthropometry, joice, heth, an, african, american, slave, was, displayed, by, p, t, barnum, in, 1836, a, few, years, after, the, exhibition, of, saartjie, baartman, the, hottentot, venus, in, england, such, exhibitions, became, common, in, the, new, imperialism, period, and, remained, so, until, world, war, ii, carl, hagenbeck, inventor, of, the, modern, zoos, exhibited, animals, beside, humans, who, were, considered, savages, congolese, pygmy, ota, benga, was, displayed, in, 1906, by, eugenicist, madison, grant, head, of, the, bronx, zoo, as, an, attempt, to, illustrate, the, missing, link, between, humans, and, orangutans, thus, racism, was, tied, to, darwinism, creating, a, social, darwinist, ideology, that, tried, to, ground, itself, in, darwin, s, scientific, discoveries, the, 1931, paris, colonial, exhibition, displayed, kanaks, from, new, caledonia, a, congolese, village, was, on, display, as, late, as, 1958, at, the, brussels, world, fair, evolutionary, psychologists, john, tooby, and, leda, cosmides, were, puzzled, by, the, fact, that, in, the, us, race, is, one, of, the, three, characteristics, most, often, used, in, brief, descriptions, of, individuals, the, others, are, age, and, sex, they, reasoned, that, natural, selection, would, not, have, favoured, the, evolution, of, an, instinct, for, using, race, as, a, classification, because, for, most, of, human, history, humans, almost, never, encountered, members, of, other, races, tooby, and, cosmides, hypothesized, that, modern, people, use, race, as, a, proxy, rough, and, ready, indicator, for, coalition, membership, since, a, better, than, random, guess, about, which, side, another, person, is, on, will, be, helpful, if, one, does, not, actually, know, in, advance, their, colleague, robert, kurzban, designed, an, experiment, whose, results, appeared, to, support, this, hypothesis, using, the, memory, confusion, protocol, they, presented, subjects, with, pictures, of, individuals, and, sentences, allegedly, spoken, by, these, individuals, which, presented, two, sides, of, a, debate, the, errors, that, the, subjects, made, in, recalling, who, said, what, indicated, that, they, sometimes, mis, attributed, a, statement, to, a, speaker, of, the, same, race, as, the, correct, speaker, although, they, also, sometimes, mis, attributed, a, statement, to, a, speaker, on, the, same, side, as, the, correct, speaker, in, a, second, run, of, the, experiment, the, team, also, distinguished, the, sides, in, the, debate, by, clothing, of, similar, colors, and, in, this, case, the, effect, of, racial, similarity, in, causing, mistakes, almost, vanished, being, replaced, by, the, color, of, their, clothing, in, other, words, the, first, group, of, subjects, with, no, clues, from, clothing, used, race, as, a, visual, guide, to, guessing, who, was, on, which, side, of, the, debate, the, second, group, of, subjects, used, the, clothing, color, as, their, main, visual, clue, and, the, effect, of, race, became, very, small, some, research, suggests, that, ethnocentric, thinking, may, have, actually, contributed, to, the, development, of, cooperation, political, scientists, ross, hammond, and, robert, axelrod, created, a, computer, simulation, wherein, virtual, individuals, were, randomly, assigned, one, of, a, variety, of, skin, colors, and, then, one, of, a, variety, of, trading, strategies, be, color, blind, favor, those, of, your, own, color, or, favor, those, of, other, colors, they, found, that, the, ethnocentric, individuals, clustered, together, then, grew, until, all, the, non, ethnocentric, individuals, were, wiped, out, in, the, selfish, gene, evolutionary, biologist, richard, dawkins, writes, that, blood, feuds, and, inter, clan, warfare, are, easily, interpretable, in, terms, of, hamilton, s, genetic, theory, dawkins, writes, that, racial, prejudice, while, not, evolutionarily, adaptive, could, be, interpreted, as, an, irrational, generalization, of, a, kin, selected, tendency, to, identify, with, individuals, physically, resembling, oneself, and, to, be, nasty, to, individuals, different, in, appearance, simulation, based, experiments, in, evolutionary, game, theory, have, attempted, to, provide, an, explanation, for, the, selection, of, ethnocentric, strategy, phenotypes, despite, support, for, evolutionary, theories, relating, to, an, innate, origin, of, racism, various, studies, have, suggested, racism, is, associated, with, lower, intelligence, and, less, diverse, peer, groups, during, childhood, a, neuroimaging, study, on, amygdala, activity, during, racial, matching, activities, found, increased, activity, to, be, associated, with, adolescent, age, as, well, as, less, racially, diverse, peer, groups, which, the, author, conclude, suggest, a, learned, aspect, of, racism, a, meta, analysis, of, neuroimaging, studies, found, amygdala, activity, correlated, to, increased, scores, on, implicit, measures, of, racial, bias, it, was, also, argued, amygdala, activity, in, response, to, racial, stimuli, represents, increased, threat, perception, rather, than, the, traditional, theory, of, the, amygdala, activity, represented, ingroup, outgroup, processing, racism, has, also, been, associated, with, lower, childhood, iq, in, an, analysis, of, 15, 000, people, in, the, uk, a, 2017, study, in, the, american, political, science, review, found, that, prejudice, towards, marginalized, groups, such, as, refugees, could, be, explained, by, a, failure, to, take, the, perspective, of, the, marginalized, group, the, study, found, that, young, hungarian, adults, who, played, a, perspective, taking, game, a, game, intended, to, reduce, prejudice, towards, marginalized, groups, by, having, players, assume, the, role, of, a, member, of, a, marginalized, group, showed, reduced, prejudice, towards, romani, people, and, refugees, as, well, as, reduced, their, vote, intentions, for, hungary, s, overtly, racist, far, right, party, by, 10, state, racism, the, institutions, and, practices, of, a, nation, state, that, are, grounded, in, racist, ideology, has, played, a, major, role, in, all, instances, of, settler, colonialism, from, the, united, states, to, australia, it, also, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, nazi, german, regime, in, fascist, regimes, throughout, europe, and, during, the, early, years, of, japan, s, sh, wa, period, these, governments, advocated, and, implemented, ideologies, and, policies, that, were, racist, xenophobic, and, in, the, case, of, nazism, genocidal, the, nuremberg, race, laws, of, 1935, prohibited, sexual, relations, between, any, aryan, and, jew, considering, it, rassenschande, racial, pollution, the, nuremberg, laws, stripped, all, jews, even, quarter, and, half, jews, second, and, first,

regime, between, 1948, and, 1994, here, a, series, of, apartheid, legislation, was, passed, through, the, legal, systems, to, make, it, legal, for, white, south, africans, to, have, rights, which, were, superior, to, those, of, non, white, south, africans, non, white, south, africans, were, not, allowed, involvement, in, any, governing, matters, including, voting, access, to, quality,
