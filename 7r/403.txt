english, grammar, is, the, set, of, structural, rules, of, the, english, language, this, includes, the, structure, of, words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and, whole, texts, this, article, describes, a, generalized, present, day, standard, english, a, form, of, speech, and, writing, used, in, public, discourse, including, broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and, news, over, a, range, of, registers, from, formal, to, informal, divergences, from, the, grammar, described, here, occur, in, some, historical, social, cultural, and, regional, varieties, of, english, although, these, are, minor, compared, to, the, differences, in, pronunciation, and, vocabulary, modern, english, has, largely, abandoned, the, inflectional, case, system, of, indo, european, in, favor, of, analytic, constructions, the, personal, pronouns, retain, morphological, case, more, strongly, than, any, other, word, class, a, remnant, of, the, more, extensive, germanic, case, system, of, old, english, for, other, pronouns, and, all, nouns, adjectives, and, articles, grammatical, function, is, indicated, only, by, word, order, by, prepositions, and, by, the, saxon, genitive, or, english, possessive, s, eight, word, classes, or, parts, of, speech, are, commonly, distinguished, in, english, nouns, determiners, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and, conjunctions, nouns, form, the, largest, word, class, and, verbs, the, second, largest, unlike, nouns, in, many, other, indo, european, languages, english, nouns, do, not, have, grammatical, gender, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and, adverbs, are, open, classes, word, classes, that, readily, accept, new, members, such, as, the, noun, celebutante, a, celebrity, who, frequents, the, fashion, circles, and, other, similar, relatively, new, words, the, rest, are, closed, classes, for, example, it, is, rare, for, a, new, pronoun, to, enter, the, language, determiners, traditionally, classified, along, with, adjectives, have, not, always, been, regarded, as, a, separate, part, of, speech, interjections, are, another, word, class, but, these, are, not, described, here, as, they, do, not, form, part, of, the, clause, and, sentence, structure, of, the, language, linguists, generally, accept, nine, english, word, classes, nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, and, exclamations, english, words, are, not, generally, marked, for, word, class, it, is, not, usually, possible, to, tell, from, the, form, of, a, word, which, class, it, belongs, to, inflectional, endings, and, derivational, suffixes, are, unique, and, specific, to, on, the, other, hand, most, words, belong, to, more, than, one, word, class, for, example, run, can, serve, as, either, a, verb, or, a, noun, these, are, regarded, as, two, different, lexemes, lexemes, may, be, inflected, to, express, different, grammatical, categories, the, lexeme, run, has, the, forms, runs, ran, runny, runner, and, running, words, in, one, class, can, sometimes, be, derived, from, those, in, another, this, has, the, potential, to, give, rise, to, new, words, for, example, the, noun, aerobics, has, given, rise, to, the, adjective, aerobicized, words, combine, to, form, phrases, a, phrase, typically, serves, the, same, function, as, a, word, from, some, particular, word, class, for, example, my, very, good, friend, peter, is, a, phrase, that, can, be, used, in, a, sentence, as, if, it, were, a, noun, and, is, therefore, called, a, noun, phrase, similarly, adjectival, phrases, and, adverbial, phrases, function, as, if, they, were, adjectives, or, adverbs, but, with, other, types, of, phrases, the, terminology, has, different, implications, for, example, a, verb, phrase, consists, of, a, verb, together, with, any, objects, and, other, dependents, a, prepositional, phrase, consists, of, a, preposition, and, its, complement, and, is, therefore, usually, a, type, of, adverbial, phrase, and, a, determiner, phrase, is, a, type, of, noun, phrase, containing, a, determiner, many, common, suffixes, form, nouns, from, other, nouns, or, from, other, types, of, words, such, as, age, shrinkage, hood, sisterhood, and, so, on, though, many, nouns, are, base, forms, containing, no, such, suffix, cat, grass, france, nouns, are, also, created, by, converting, verbs, and, adjectives, as, with, the, words, talk, and, reading, a, boring, talk, the, assigned, reading, nouns, are, sometimes, classified, semantically, by, their, meanings, as, proper, and, common, nouns, cyrus, china, vs, frog, milk, or, as, concrete, and, abstract, nouns, book, laptop, vs, embarrassment, prejudice, a, grammatical, distinction, is, often, made, between, count, countable, nouns, such, as, clock, and, city, and, non, count, uncountable, nouns, such, as, milk, and, decor, some, nouns, can, function, both, as, countable, and, as, uncountable, such, as, wine, in, this, is, a, good, wine, countable, nouns, generally, have, singular, and, plural, forms, in, most, cases, the, plural, is, formed, from, the, singular, by, adding, s, as, in, dogs, bushes, although, there, are, also, irregular, forms, woman, women, foot, feet, including, cases, where, the, two, forms, are, identical, sheep, series, for, more, details, see, english, plural, certain, nouns, can, be, used, with, plural, verbs, even, though, they, are, singular, in, form, as, in, the, government, were, where, the, government, is, considered, to, refer, to, the, people, constituting, the, government, this, is, a, form, of, synesis, and, is, more, common, in, british, than, american, english, see, english, plural, singulars, with, collective, meaning, treated, as, plural, english, nouns, are, not, marked, for, case, as, they, are, in, some, languages, but, they, have, possessive, forms, through, the, addition, of, s, as, in, john, s, children, s, or, just, an, apostrophe, with, no, change, in, pronunciation, in, the, case, of, s, plurals, the, dogs, owners, and, sometimes, other, words, ending, with, s, jesus, love, more, generally, the, ending, can, be, applied, to, noun, phrases, as, in, the, man, you, saw, yesterday, s, sister, see, below, the, possessive, form, can, be, used, either, as, a, determiner, manyanda, s, cat, or, as, a, noun, phrase, manyanda, s, is, the, one, next, to, jane, s, the, status, of, the, possessive, as, an, affix, or, a, clitic, is, the, subject, of, debate, it, differs, from, the, noun, inflection, of, languages, such, as, german, in, that, the, genitive, ending, may, attach, to, the, last, word, of, the, phrase, to, account, for, this, the, possessive, can, be, analysed, for, instance, as, a, clitic, construction, an, enclitic, postposition, or, as, an, inflection, of, the, last, word, of, a, phrase, edge, inflection, noun, phrases, are, phrases, that, function, grammatically, as, nouns, within, sentences, for, example, as, the, subject, or, object, of, a, verb, most, noun, phrases, have, a, noun, as, their, head, an, english, noun, phrase, typically, takes, the, following, form, not, all, elements, need, be, present, in, this, structure, an, example, of, a, noun, phrase, that, includes, all, of, the, above, mentioned, elements, is, that, rather, attractive, young, college, student, to, whom, you, were, talking, here, that, is, the, determiner, rather, attractive, and, young, are, adjectival, pre, modifiers, college, is, a, noun, adjunct, student, is, the, noun, serving, as, the, head, of, the, phrase, and, to, whom, you, were, talking, is, a, post, modifier, a, relative, clause, in, this, case, notice, the, order, of, the, pre, modifiers, the, determiner, that, must, come, first, and, the, noun, adjunct, college, must, come, after, the, adjectival, modifiers, coordinators, such, as, and, or, and, but, can, be, used, at, various, levels, in, noun, phrases, as, in, john, paul, and, mary, the, matching, green, coat, and, hat, a, dangerous, but, exciting, ride, a, person, sitting, down, or, standing, up, see, conjunctions, below, for, more, explanation, noun, phrases, can, also, be, placed, in, apposition, where, two, consecutive, phrases, refer, to, the, same, thing, as, in, that, president, abraham, lincoln, where, that, president, and, abraham, lincoln, are, in, apposition, in, some, contexts, the, same, can, be, expressed, by, a, prepositional, phrase, as, in, the, twin, curses, of, famine, and, pestilence, meaning, the, twin, curses, that, are, famine, and, pestilence, particular, forms, of, noun, phrases, include, a, system, of, grammatical, gender, whereby, every, noun, was, treated, as, either, masculine, feminine, or, neuter, existed, in, old, english, but, fell, out, of, use, during, the, middle, english, period, modern, english, retains, features, relating, to, natural, gender, most, prominently, the, use, of, pronouns, such, as, he, and, she, to, refer, specifically, to, persons, or, animals, of, one, or, other, genders, and, certain, others, such, as, it, for, sexless, objects, although, feminine, pronouns, are, sometimes, used, when, referring, to, ships, and, more, uncommonly, some, airplanes, and, analogous, machinery, and, nation, states, some, aspects, of, gender, usage, in, english, have, been, influenced, by, the, movement, towards, a, preference, for, gender, neutral, language, animals, are, triple, gender, nouns, being, able, to, take, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, pronouns, while, the, vast, majority, of, nouns, in, english, do, not, carry, gender, there, remain, some, gendered, nouns, e, g, ewe, sow, rooster, and, derivational, affixes, e, g, widower, waitress, that, denote, gender, many, nouns, that, mention, people, s, roles, and, jobs, can, refer, to, either, a, masculine, or, a, feminine, subject, for, instance, cousin, teenager, teacher, doctor, student, friend, and, colleague, often, the, gender, distinction, for, these, neutral, nouns, is, established, by, inserting, the, word, male, or, female, rarely, nouns, illustrating, things, with, no, gender, are, referred, to, with, a, gendered, pronoun, to, convey, familiarity, it, is, also, standard, to, use, the, gender, neutral, pronoun, it, english, determiners, constitute, a, relatively, small, class, of, words, they, include, the, articles, the, and, a, certain, demonstrative, and, interrogative, words, such, as, this, that, and, which, possessives, such, as, my, and, whose, the, role, of, determiner, can, also, be, played, by, noun, possessive, forms, such, as, john, s, and, the, girl, s, various, quantifying, words, like, all, some, many, various, and, numerals, one, two, etc, there, are, also, many, phrases, such, as, a, couple, of, that, can, play, the, role, of, determiners, determiners, are, used, in, the, formation, of, noun, phrases, see, above, many, words, that, serve, as, determiners, can, also, be, used, as, pronouns, this, that, many, etc, determiners, can, be, used, in, certain, combinations, such, as, all, the, water, and, the, many, problems, in, many, contexts, it, is, required, for, a, noun, phrase, to, be, completed, with, an, article, or, some, other, determiner, it, is, not, grammatical, to, say, just, cat, sat, on, table, one, must, say, my, cat, sat, on, the, table, the, most, common, situations, in, which, a, complete, noun, phrase, can, be, formed, without, a, determiner, are, when, it, refers, generally, to, a, whole, class, or, concept, as, in, dogs, are, dangerous, and, beauty, is, subjective, and, when, it, is, a, name, jane, spain, etc, this, is, discussed, in, more, detail, at, english, articles, and, zero, article, in, english, pronouns, are, a, relatively, small, closed, class, of, words, that, function, in, the, place, of, nouns, or, noun, phrases, they, include, personal, pronouns, demonstrative, pronouns, relative, pronouns, interrogative, pronouns, and, some, others, mainly, indefinite, pronouns, the, full, set, of, english, pronouns, is, presented, in, the, following, table, nonstandard, informal, and, archaic, forms, are, in, italics, interrogative, it, interrogative, only, the, personal, pronouns, of, modern, standard, english, are, presented, in, the, table, above, they, are, i, you, she, he, it, we, and, they, the, personal, pronouns, are, so, called, not, because, they, apply, to, persons, which, other, pronouns, also, do, but, because, they, participate, in, the, system, of, grammatical, person, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, the, second, person, forms, such, as, you, are, used, with, both, singular, and, plural, reference, in, the, southern, united, states, y, all, you, all, is, used, as, a, plural, form, and, various, other, phrases, such, as, you, guys, are, used, in, other, places, an, archaic, set, of, second, person, pronouns, used, for, singular, reference, is, thou, thee, thyself, thy, thine, which, are, still, used, in, religious, services, and, can, be, seen, in, older, works, such, as, shakespeare, s, in, such, texts, the, you, set, of, pronouns, are, used, for, plural, reference, or, with, singular, reference, as, a, formal, v, form, you, can, also, be, used, as, an, indefinite, pronoun, referring, to, a, person, in, general, see, generic, you, compared, to, the, more, formal, alternative, one, reflexive, oneself, possessive, one, s, the, third, person, singular, forms, are, differentiated, according, to, the, gender, of, the, referent, for, example, she, is, used, to, refer, to, a, woman, sometimes, a, female, animal, and, sometimes, an, object, to, which, feminine, characteristics, are, attributed, such, as, a, ship, or, a, country, a, man, and, sometimes, a, male, animal, is, referred, to, using, he, in, other, cases, it, can, be, used, see, gender, in, english, the, word, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, dummy, subject, concerning, abstract, ideas, like, time, weather, etc, the, third, person, form, they, is, used, with, both, plural, and, singular, referents, historically, singular, they, was, restricted, to, quantificational, constructions, such, as, each, employee, should, clean, their, desk, and, referential, cases, where, the, referent, s, gender, was, unknown, however, it, is, increasingly, used, when, the, referent, s, gender, is, irrelevant, or, when, the, referent, is, neither, male, nor, female, the, possessive, determiners, such, as, my, are, used, as, determiners, together, with, nouns, as, in, my, old, man, some, of, his, friends, the, second, possessive, forms, like, mine, are, used, when, they, do, not, qualify, a, noun, as, pronouns, as, in, mine, is, bigger, than, yours, and, as, predicates, as, in, this, one, is, mine, note, also, the, construction, a, friend, of, mine, meaning, someone, who, is, my, friend, see, english, possessive, for, more, details, the, demonstrative, pronouns, of, english, are, this, plural, these, and, that, plural, those, as, in, these, are, good, i, like, that, all, four, words, can, also, be, used, as, determiners, followed, by, a, noun, as, in, those, cars, they, can, also, form, the, alternative, pronominal, expressions, this, that, one, these, those, ones, the, interrogative, pronouns, are, who, what, and, which, all, of, them, can, take, the, suffix, ever, for, emphasis, the, pronoun, who, refers, to, a, person, or, people, it, has, an, oblique, form, whom, though, in, informal, contexts, this, is, usually, replaced, by, who, and, a, possessive, form, pronoun, or, determiner, whose, the, pronoun, what, refers, to, things, or, abstracts, the, word, which, is, used, to, ask, about, alternatives, from, what, is, seen, as, a, closed, set, which, of, the, books, do, you, like, best, it, can, also, be, an, interrogative, determiner, which, book, this, can, form, the, alternative, pronominal, expressions, which, one, and, which, ones, which, who, and, what, can, be, either, singular, or, plural, although, who, and, what, often, take, a, singular, verb, regardless, of, any, supposed, number, for, more, information, see, who, in, old, and, middle, english, the, roles, of, the, three, words, were, different, from, their, roles, today, the, interrogative, pronoun, hw, who, what, had, only, singular, forms, and, also, only, distinguished, between, non, neuter, and, neuter, the, neuter, nominative, form, being, hw, t, note, that, neuter, and, non, neuter, refers, to, the, grammatical, gender, system, of, the, time, rather, than, the, so, called, natural, gender, system, of, today, a, small, holdover, of, this, is, the, ability, of, relative, but, not, interrogative, whose, to, refer, to, non, persons, e, g, the, car, whose, door, won, t, open, all, the, interrogative, pronouns, can, also, be, used, as, relative, pronouns, though, what, is, quite, limited, in, its, use, see, below, for, more, details, the, main, relative, pronouns, in, english, are, who, with, its, derived, forms, whom, and, whose, which, and, that, the, relative, pronoun, which, refers, to, things, rather, than, persons, as, in, the, shirt, which, used, to, be, red, is, faded, for, persons, who, is, used, the, man, who, saw, me, was, tall, the, oblique, case, form, of, who, is, whom, as, in, the, man, whom, i, saw, was, tall, although, in, informal, registers, who, is, commonly, used, in, place, of, whom, the, possessive, form, of, who, is, whose, for, example, the, man, whose, car, is, missing, however, the, use, of, whose, is, not, restricted, to, persons, one, can, say, an, idea, whose, time, has, come, the, word, that, as, a, relative, pronoun, is, normally, found, only, in, restrictive, relative, clauses, unlike, which, and, who, which, can, be, used, in, both, restrictive, and, unrestrictive, clauses, it, can, refer, to, either, persons, or, things, and, cannot, follow, a, preposition, for, example, one, can, say, the, song, that, i, listened, to, yesterday, but, the, song, to, which, i, listened, yesterday, the, relative, pronoun, that, is, usually, pronounced, with, a, reduced, vowel, schwa, and, hence, differently, from, the, demonstrative, that, see, weak, and, strong, forms, in, english, if, that, is, not, the, subject, of, the, relative, clause, it, can, be, omitted, the, song, i, listened, to, yesterday, the, word, what, can, be, used, to, form, a, free, relative, clause, one, that, has, no, antecedent, and, that, serves, as, a, complete, noun, phrase, in, itself, as, in, i, like, what, he, likes, the, words, whatever, and, whichever, can, be, used, similarly, in, the, role, of, either, pronouns, whatever, he, likes, or, determiners, whatever, book, he, likes, when, referring, to, persons, who, ever, and, whom, ever, can, be, used, in, a, similar, way, the, word, there, is, used, as, a, pronoun, in, some, sentences, playing, the, role, of, a, dummy, subject, normally, of, an, intransitive, verb, the, logical, subject, of, the, verb, then, appears, as, a, complement, after, the, verb, this, use, of, there, occurs, most, commonly, with, forms, of, the, verb, be, in, existential, clauses, to, refer, to, the, presence, or, existence, of, something, for, example, there, is, a, heaven, there, are, two, cups, on, the, table, there, have, been, a, lot, of, problems, lately, it, can, also, be, used, with, other, verbs, there, exist, two, major, variants, there, occurred, a, very, strange, incident, the, dummy, subject, takes, the, number, singular, or, plural, of, the, logical, subject, complement, hence, it, takes, a, plural, verb, if, the, complement, is, plural, in, informal, english, however, the, contraction, there, s, is, often, used, for, both, singular, and, plural, the, dummy, subject, can, undergo, inversion, is, there, a, test, today, and, never, has, there, been, a, man, such, as, this, it, can, also, appear, without, a, corresponding, logical, subject, in, short, sentences, and, question, tags, there, wasn, t, a, discussion, was, there, there, was, the, word, there, in, such, sentences, has, sometimes, been, analyzed, as, an, adverb, or, as, a, dummy, predicate, rather, than, as, a, pronoun, however, its, identification, as, a, pronoun, is, most, consistent, with, its, behavior, in, inverted, sentences, and, question, tags, as, described, above, because, the, word, there, can, also, be, a, deictic, adverb, meaning, at, to, that, place, a, sentence, like, there, is, a, river, could, have, either, of, two, meanings, a, river, exists, with, there, as, a, pronoun, and, a, river, is, in, that, place, with, there, as, an, adverb, in, speech, the, adverbial, there, would, be, given, stress, while, the, pronoun, would, not, in, fact, the, pronoun, is, often, pronounced, as, a, weak, form, r, the, english, reciprocal, pronouns, are, each, other, and, one, another, although, they, are, written, with, a, space, they, re, best, thought, of, as, single, words, no, consistent, distinction, in, meaning, or, use, can, be, found, between, them, like, the, reflexive, pronouns, their, use, is, limited, to, contexts, where, an, antecedent, precedes, it, in, the, case, of, the, reciprocals, they, need, to, appear, in, the, same, clause, as, the, antecedent, other, pronouns, in, english, are, often, identical, in, form, to, determiners, especially, quantifiers, such, as, many, a, little, etc, sometimes, the, pronoun, form, is, different, as, with, none, corresponding, to, the, determiner, no, nothing, everyone, somebody, etc, many, examples, are, listed, as, indefinite, pronouns, another, indefinite, or, impersonal, pronoun, is, one, with, its, reflexive, form, oneself, and, possessive, one, s, which, is, a, more, formal, alternative, to, generic, you, the, basic, form, of, an, english, verb, is, not, generally, marked, by, any, ending, although, there, are, certain, suffixes, that, are, frequently, used, to, form, verbs, such, as, ate, formulate, fy, electrify, and, ise, ize, realise, realize, many, verbs, also, contain, prefixes, such, as, un, unmask, out, outlast, over, overtake, and, under, undervalue, verbs, can, also, be, formed, from, nouns, and, adjectives, by, zero, derivation, as, with, the, verbs, snare, nose, dry, and, calm, most, verbs, have, three, or, four, inflected, forms, in, addition, to, the, base, form, a, third, person, singular, present, tense, form, in, e, s, writes, botches, a, present, participle, and, gerund, form, in, ing, writing, a, past, tense, wrote, and, though, often, identical, to, the, past, tense, form, a, past, participle, written, regular, verbs, have, identical, past, tense, and, past, participle, forms, in, ed, but, there, are, 100, or, so, irregular, english, verbs, with, different, forms, see, list, the, verbs, have, do, and, say, also, have, irregular, third, person, present, tense, forms, has, does, d, z, says, s, z, the, verb, be, has, the, largest, number, of, irregular, forms, am, is, are, in, the, present, tense, was, were, in, the, past, tense, been, for, the, past, participle, most, of, what, are, often, referred, to, as, verb, tenses, or, sometimes, aspects, in, english, are, formed, using, auxiliary, verbs, apart, from, what, are, called, the, simple, present, write, writes, and, simple, past, wrote, there, are, also, continuous, progressive, forms, am, is,

sometimes, replace, will, and, would, in, the, first, person, for, the, uses, of, these, various, verb, forms, see, english, verbs, and, english, clause, syntax, the, basic, form, of, the, verb, be, write, play, is, used, as, the, infinitive, although, there, is, also, a, to, infinitive, to, be, to, write, to, play, used, in, many, syntactical, constructions, there, are, also, infinitives, corresponding, to, other, aspects, to, have, written, to, be, writing, to, have, been, writing, the, second, person, imperative, is, identical, to, the, basic, infinitive, other, imperative, forms, may, be, made, with, let, let, us, go, or, let, s, go, let, them, eat, cake, a, form, identical, to, the, infinitive, can, be, used, as, a, present, subjunctive, in, certain, contexts, it, is, important, that, he, follow, them, or, that, he, be, committed, to, the, cause, there, is, also, a, past, subjunctive, distinct, from, the, simple, past, only, in, the, possible, use, of, were, instead, of, was, used, in, some, conditional, sentences, and, similar, if, i, were, or, was, rich, were, he, to, arrive, now, i, wish, she, were, or, was, here, for, details, see, english,

of, them, it, is, idiomatic, to, use, adverbs, such, as, completely, another, type, of, adjective, sometimes, considered, ungradable, is, those, that, represent, an, extreme, degree, of, some,

etymology, see, ly, certain, words, can, be, used, as, both, adjectives, and, adverbs, such, as, fast, straight, and, hard, these, are, flat, adverbs, in, earlier, usage, more, flat, adverbs, were, accepted, in, formal, usage, many, of, these, survive, in, idioms, and, colloquially, that, s, just, plain, ugly, some, adjectives, can, also, be, used, as, flat, adverbs, when, they, actually,

possible, we, carefully, considered, the, proposal, many, adverbs, of, frequency, degree, certainty, etc, such, as, often, always, almost, probably, and, various, others, such, as, just, tend, to, be, placed, before, the, verb, they, usually, have, chips, although, if, there, is, an, auxiliary, or, other, special, verb, see, verbs, above, then, the, normal, position, for, such, adverbs, is, after, that, special, verb, or, after, the, first, of, them, if, there, is, more, than, one, i, have, just, finished, the, crossword, she, can, usually, manage, a, pint, we, are, never, late, you, might,

place, for, a, sentence, are, typically, placed, at, the, start, of, the, sentence, yesterday, we, went, on, a, shopping, expedition, if, the, verb, has, an, object, the, adverb, comes, after, the, object, he, finished, the, test, quickly, when, there, is, more, than, one, types, of, adverb, they, usually, appear, in, the, order, manner, place, time, his, arm, was, hurt, severely, at, home, yesterday, a, special, type, of, adverb, is, the, adverbial, particle, used, to, form, phrasal, verbs, such, as, up, in, pick, up, on, in, get, on, etc, if, such, a, verb, also, has, an, object, then, the, particle, may, precede, or, follow, the, object, although, it, will, normally, follow, the, object, if, the, object, is, a, pronoun, pick, the, pen, up, or, pick, up, the, pen, but, pick, it, up,

adverb, phrases, and, complements, analogously, to, the, adjective, phrases, described, above, for, example, very, sleepily, all, too, suddenly, oddly, enough, perhaps, shockingly, for, us, another, very, common, type, of, adverb, phrase, is, the, prepositional, phrase, which, consists, of, a, preposition, and, its, object, in, the, pool, after, two, years, for, the, sake, of, harmony, prepositions, form, a, closed, word, class, although, there, are, also, certain, phrases, that, serve, as, prepositions, such, as, in, front, of, a, single, preposition, may, have, a, variety, of, meanings, often, including, temporal, spatial, and, abstract, many, words, that, are, prepositions, can, also, serve, as, adverbs, examples, of, common, english, prepositions, including, phrasal, instances, are, of, in, on, over, under, to, from, with, in, front, of, behind, opposite, by, before, after, during, through, in, spite, of, or, despite, between, among, etc, a, preposition, is, usually, used, with, a, noun, phrase, as, its, complement, a, preposition, together, with, its, complement, is, called, a, prepositional, phrase, examples, are, in, england, under, the, table, after, six, pleasant, weeks, between, the, land, and, the, sea, a, prepositional, phrase, can, be, used, as, a, complement, or, post, modifier, of, a, noun, in, a, noun, phrase, as, in, the, man, in, the, car, the, start, of, the, fight, as, a, complement, of, a, verb, or, adjective, as, in, deal, with, the, problem, proud, of, oneself, or, generally, as, an, adverb, phrase, see, above, english, allows, the, use, of, stranded, prepositions, this, can, occur, in, interrogative, and, relative, clauses, where, the, interrogative, or, relative, pronoun, that, is, the, preposition, s, complement, is, moved, to, the, start, fronted, leaving, the, preposition, in, place, this, kind, of, structure, is, avoided, in, some, kinds, of, formal, english, for, example, notice, that, in, the, second, example, the, relative, pronoun, that, could, be, omitted, stranded, prepositions, can, also, arise, in, passive, voice, constructions, and, other, uses, of, passive, past, participial, phrases, where, the, complement, in, a, prepositional, phrase, can, become, zero, in, the, same, way, that, a, verb, s, direct, object, would, it, was, looked, at, i, will, be, operated, on, get, your, teeth, seen, to, the, same, can, happen, in, certain, uses, of, infinitive, phrases, he, is, nice, to, talk, to, this, is, the, page, to, make, copies, of, conjunctions, express, a, variety, of, logical, relations, between, items, phrases, clauses, and, sentences, the, principal, coordinating, conjunctions, in, english, are, and, or, but, nor, so, yet, and, for, these, can, be, used, in, many, grammatical, contexts, to, link, two, or, more, items, of, equal, grammatical, status, for, example, there, are, also, correlative, conjunctions, where, as, well, as, the, basic, conjunction, an, additional, element, appears, before, the, first, of, the, items, being, linked, the, common, correlatives, in, english, are, subordinators, make, relations, between, clauses, making, the, clause, in, which, they, appear, into, a, subordinate, clause, some, common, subordinators, in, english, are, subordinating, conjunction, generally, comes, at, the, very, start, of, its, clause, although, many, of, them, can, be, preceded, by, qualifying, adverbs, as, in, probably, because, especially, if, the, conjunction, that, can, be, omitted, after, certain, verbs, as, in, she, told, us, that, she, was, ready, for, the, use, of, that, in, relative, clauses, see, relative, pronouns, above, although, english, has, largely, lost, its, case, system, personal, pronouns, still, have, three, morphological, cases, that, are, simplified, forms, of, the, nominative, objective, and, genitive, cases, most, english, personal, pronouns, have, five, forms, the, nominative, and, oblique, case, forms, the, possessive, case, which, has, both, a, determiner, form, such, as, my, our, and, a, distinct, independent, form, such, as, mine, ours, with, two, exceptions, the, third, person, singular, masculine, and, the, third, person, singular, neuter, it, which, use, the, same, form, for, both, determiner, and, independent, and, a, distinct, reflexive, or, intensive, form, such, as, myself, ourselves, the, interrogative, personal, pronoun, who, exhibits, the, greatest, diversity, of, forms, within, the, modern, english, pronoun, system, having, definite, nominative, oblique, and, genitive, forms, who, whom, whose, and, equivalently, coordinating, indefinite, forms, whoever, whomever, and, whosever, forms, such, as, i, he, and, we, are, used, for, the, subject, i, kicked, the, ball, whereas, forms, such, as, me, him, and, us, are, used, for, the, object, john, kicked, me, nouns, have, distinct, singular, and, plural, forms, that, is, they, decline, to, reflect, their, grammatical, number, consider, the, difference, between, book, and, books, in, addition, a, few, english, pronouns, have, distinct, nominative, also, called, subjective, and, oblique, or, objective, forms, that, is, they, decline, to, reflect, their, relationship, to, a, verb, or, preposition, or, case, consider, the, difference, between, he, subjective, and, him, objective, as, in, he, saw, it, and, it, saw, him, similarly, consider, who, which, is, subjective, and, the, objective, whom, further, these, pronouns, and, a, few, others, have, distinct, possessive, forms, such, as, his, and, whose, by, contrast, nouns, have, no, distinct, nominative, and, objective, forms, the, two, being, merged, into, a, single, plain, case, for, example, chair, does, not, change, form, between, the, chair, is, here, subject, and, i, saw, the, chair, direct, object, possession, is, shown, by, the, clitic, s, attached, to, a, possessive, noun, phrase, rather, than, by, declension, of, the, noun, itself, as, noted, above, under, verbs, a, finite, indicative, verb, or, its, clause, is, negated, by, placing, the, word, not, after, an, auxiliary, modal, or, other, special, verb, such, as, do, can, or, be, for, example, the, clause, i, go, is, negated, with, the, appearance, of, the, auxiliary, do, as, i, do, not, go, see, do, support, when, the, affirmative, already, uses, auxiliary, verbs, i, am, going, no, other, auxiliary, verbs, are, added, to, negate, the, clause, i, am, not, going, until, the, period, of, early, modern, english, negation, was, effected, without, additional, auxiliary, verbs, i, go, not, most, combinations, of, auxiliary, verbs, etc, with, not, have, contracted, forms, don, t, can, t, isn, t, etc, also, the, uncontracted, negated, form, of, can, is, written, as, a, single, word, cannot, on, the, inversion, of, subject, and, verb, such, as, in, questions, see, below, the, subject, may, be, placed, after, a, contracted, negated, form, should, he, not, pay, or, shouldn, t, he, pay, other, elements, such, as, noun, phrases, adjectives, adverbs, infinitive, and, participial, phrases, etc, can, be, negated, by, placing, the, word, not, before, them, not, the, right, answer, not, interesting, not, to, enter, not, noticing, the, train, etc, when, other, negating, words, such, as, never, nobody, etc, appear, in, a, sentence, the, negating, not, is, omitted, unlike, its, equivalents, in, many, languages, i, saw, nothing, or, i, didn, t, see, anything, but, not, except, in, non, standard, speech, i, didn, t, see, nothing, see, double, negative, such, negating, words, generally, have, corresponding, negative, polarity, items, ever, for, never, anybody, for, nobody, etc, which, can, appear, in, a, negative, context, but, are, not, negative, themselves, and, can, thus, be, used, after, a, negation, without, giving, rise, to, double, negatives, a, typical, sentence, contains, one, independent, clause, and, possibly, one, or, more, dependent, clauses, although, it, is, also, possible, to, link, together, sentences, of, this, form, into, longer, sentences, using, coordinating, conjunctions, see, above, a, clause, typically, contains, a, subject, a, noun, phrase, and, a, predicate, a, verb, phrase, in, the, terminology, used, above, that, is, a, verb, together, with, its, objects, and, complements, a, dependent, clause, also, normally, contains, a, subordinating, conjunction, or, in, the, case, of, relative, clauses, a, relative, pronoun, or, phrase, containing, one, english, word, order, has, moved, from, the, germanic, verb, second, v2, word, order, to, being, almost, exclusively, subject, verb, object, svo, the, combination, of, svo, order, and, use, of, auxiliary, verbs, often, creates, clusters, of, two, or, more, verbs, at, the, center, of, the, sentence, such, as, he, had, hoped, to, try, to, open, it, in, most, sentences, english, marks, grammatical, relations, only, through, word, order, the, subject, constituent, precedes, the, verb, and, the, object, constituent, follows, it, the, object, subject, verb, osv, may, on, occasion, be, seen, in, english, usually, in, the, future, tense, or, used, as, a, contrast, with, the, conjunction, but, such, as, in, the, following, examples, rome, i, shall, see, i, hate, oranges, but, apples, i, ll, eat, like, many, other, western, european, languages, english, historically, allowed, questions, to, be, formed, by, inverting, the, positions, of, the, verb, and, subject, modern, english, permits, this, only, in, the, case, of, a, small, class, of, verbs, special, verbs, consisting, of, auxiliaries, as, well, as, forms, of, the, copula, be, see, subject, auxiliary, inversion, to, form, a, question, from, a, sentence, which, does, not, have, such, an, auxiliary, or, copula, present, the, auxiliary, verb, do, does, did, needs, to, be, inserted, along, with, inversion, of, the, word, order, to, form, a, question, see, do, support, for, example, the, above, concerns, yes, no, questions, but, inversion, also, takes, place, in, the, same, way, after, other, questions, formed, with, interrogative, words, such, as, where, what, how, etc, an, exception, applies, when, the, interrogative, word, is, the, subject, or, part, of, the, subject, in, which, case, there, is, no, inversion, for, example, inversion, does, not, apply, in, indirect, questions, i, wonder, where, he, is, not, where, is, he, indirect, yes, no, questions, can, be, expressed, using, if, or, whether, as, the, interrogative, word, ask, them, whether, if, they, saw, him, negative, questions, are, formed, similarly, however, if, the, verb, undergoing, inversion, has, a, contraction, with, not, then, it, is, possible, to, invert, the, subject, with, this, contraction, as, a, whole, for, example, see, also, english, auxiliaries, and, contractions, contractions, and, inversion, the, syntax, of, a, dependent, clause, is, generally, the, same, as, that, of, an, independent, clause, except, that, the, dependent, clause, usually, begins, with, a, subordinating, conjunction, or, relative, pronoun, or, phrase, containing, such, in, some, situations, as, already, described, the, conjunction, or, relative, pronoun, that, can, be, omitted, another, type, of, dependent, clause, with, no, subordinating, conjunction, is, the, conditional, clause, formed, by, inversion, see, below, the, clause, structure, with, an, inverted, subject, and, verb, used, to, form, questions, as, described, above, is, also, used, in, certain, types, of, declarative, sentences, this, occurs, mainly, when, the, sentence, begins, with, adverbial, or, other, phrases, that, are, essentially, negative, or, contain, words, such, as, only, hardly, etc, never, have, i, known, someone, so, stupid, only, in, france, can, such, food, be, tasted, in, elliptical, sentences, see, below, inversion, takes, place, after, so, meaning, also, as, well, as, after, the, negative, neither, so, do, i, neither, does, she, inversion, can, also, be, used, to, form, conditional, clauses, beginning, with, should, were, subjunctive, or, had, in, the, following, ways, other, similar, forms, sometimes, appear, but, are, less, common, there, is, also, a, construction, with, subjunctive, be, as, in, be, he, alive, or, dead, meaning, no, matter, whether, he, is, alive, or, dead, use, of, inversion, to, express, a, third, person, imperative, is, now, mostly, confined, to, the, expression, long, live, x, meaning, let, x, live, long, in, an, imperative, sentence, one, giving, an, order, there, is, usually, no, subject, in, the, independent, clause, go, away, until, i, call, you, it, is, possible, however, to, include, you, as, the, subject, for, emphasis, you, stay, away, from, me, many, types, of, elliptical, construction, are, possible, in, english, resulting, in, sentences, that, omit, certain, redundant, elements, various, examples, are, given, in, the, article, on, ellipsis, some, notable, elliptical, forms, found, in, english, include, the, first, published, english, grammar, was, a, pamphlet, for, grammar, of, 1586, written, by, william, bullokar, with, the, stated, goal, of, demonstrating, that, english, was, just, as, rule, based, as, latin, bullokar, s, grammar, was, faithfully, modeled, on, william, lily, s, latin, grammar, rudimenta, grammatices, 1534, used, in, english, schools, at, that, time, having, been, prescribed, for, them, in, 1542, by, henry, viii, bullokar, wrote, his, grammar, in, english, and, used, a, reformed, spelling, system, of, his, own, invention, but, much, english, grammar, for, much, of, the, century, after, bullokar, s, effort, was, written, in, latin, especially, by, authors, who, were, aiming, to, be, scholarly, john, wallis, s, grammatica, linguae, anglicanae, 1685, was, the, last, english, grammar, written, in, latin, even, as, late, as, the, early, 19th, century, lindley, murray, the,
