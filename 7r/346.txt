writing, is, the, act, of, creating, a, persistent, representation, of, human, language, a, writing, system, uses, a, set, of, symbols, and, rules, to, encode, aspects, of, spoken, language, such, as, its, lexicon, and, syntax, however, written, language, may, take, on, characteristics, distinct, from, those, of, any, spoken, language, writing, is, a, cognitive, and, social, activity, involving, neuropsychological, and, physical, processes, the, outcome, of, this, activity, also, called, writing, and, sometimes, a, text, is, a, series, of, physically, inscribed, mechanically, transferred, or, digitally, represented, symbols, the, interpreter, or, activator, of, a, text, is, called, a, reader, in, general, writing, systems, do, not, constitute, languages, in, and, of, themselves, but, rather, a, means, of, encoding, language, such, that, it, can, be, read, by, others, across, time, and, space, while, not, all, languages, use, a, writing, system, those, that, do, can, complement, and, extend, the, capacities, of, spoken, language, by, creating, durable, forms, of, language, that, can, be, transmitted, across, space, e, g, written, correspondence, and, stored, over, time, e, g, libraries, or, other, public, records, writing, can, also, have, knowledge, transforming, effects, since, it, allows, humans, to, externalize, their, thinking, in, forms, that, are, easier, to, reflect, on, elaborate, on, reconsider, and, revise, any, instance, of, writing, involves, a, complex, interaction, among, available, tools, intentions, cultural, customs, cognitive, routines, genres, tacit, and, explicit, knowledge, and, the, constraints, and, limitations, of, the, writing, system, s, deployed, inscriptions, have, been, made, with, fingers, styluses, quills, ink, brushes, pencils, pens, and, many, styles, of, lithography, surfaces, used, for, these, inscriptions, include, stone, tablets, clay, tablets, bamboo, slats, papyrus, wax, tablets, vellum, parchment, paper, copperplate, slate, porcelain, and, other, enameled, surfaces, the, incas, used, knotted, cords, known, as, quipu, or, khipu, for, keeping, records, countless, writing, tools, and, surfaces, have, been, improvised, throughout, history, as, the, cases, of, graffiti, tattooing, and, impromptu, aides, memoire, illustrate, the, typewriter, and, subsequently, various, digital, word, processors, have, recently, become, widespread, writing, tools, and, studies, have, compared, the, ways, in, which, writers, have, framed, the, experience, of, writing, with, such, tools, as, compared, with, the, pen, or, pencil, word, processors, include, often, multi, document, text, editors, or, note, taking, apps, web, systems, search, engines, wikis, etc, messaging, software, chat, apps, e, mail, uis, etc, or, their, underlying, operating, systems, code, supporting, the, text, input, device, s, advancements, in, natural, language, processing, and, natural, language, generation, allow, certain, tools, in, the, form, of, software, to, produce, certain, kinds, of, highly, formulaic, writing, e, g, weather, forecasts, and, brief, sports, reporting, without, the, direct, involvement, of, humans, after, initial, configuration, or, more, commonly, to, be, used, to, support, writing, processes, such, as, generating, initial, drafts, producing, feedback, with, the, help, of, a, rubric, copy, editing, and, helping, translation, writing, technologies, from, different, eras, coexist, easily, in, many, homes, and, workplaces, during, the, course, of, a, day, or, even, a, single, episode, of, writing, for, example, a, writer, might, instinctively, switch, among, a, pencil, a, touchscreen, a, text, editor, a, whiteboard, a, legal, pad, and, adhesive, notes, as, different, purposes, arise, as, human, societies, emerged, collective, motivations, for, the, development, of, writing, were, driven, by, pragmatic, exigencies, like, keeping, track, of, produce, and, other, wealth, recording, history, maintaining, culture, codifying, knowledge, through, curricula, and, lists, of, texts, deemed, to, contain, foundational, knowledge, e, g, the, canon, of, medicine, or, artistic, value, e, g, the, literary, canon, organizing, and, governing, societies, through, texts, including, legal, codes, census, records, contracts, deeds, of, ownership, taxation, trade, agreements, and, treaties, as, charles, bazerman, explains, the, marking, of, signs, on, stones, clay, paper, and, now, digital, memories, each, more, portable, and, rapidly, traveling, than, the, previous, provided, means, for, increasingly, coordinated, and, extended, action, as, well, as, memory, across, larger, groups, of, people, over, time, and, space, for, example, around, the, 4th, millennium, bc, the, complexity, of, trade, and, administration, in, mesopotamia, outgrew, human, memory, and, writing, became, a, more, dependable, method, for, creating, permanent, records, of, transactions, on, the, other, hand, writing, in, both, ancient, egypt, and, mesoamerica, may, have, evolved, through, the, political, necessity, to, manage, the, calendar, for, recording, historical, and, environmental, events, further, innovations, included, more, uniform, predictable, and, widely, dispersed, legal, systems, the, distribution, of, accessible, versions, of, sacred, texts, and, furthering, practices, of, scientific, inquiry, and, knowledge, management, all, of, which, were, largely, reliant, on, portable, and, easily, reproducible, forms, of, inscribed, language, the, history, of, writing, is, co, extensive, with, uses, of, writing, and, the, elaboration, of, activity, systems, that, give, rise, to, and, circulate, writing, individual, motivations, for, writing, include, improvised, additional, capacity, for, the, limitations, of, human, memory, e, g, to, do, lists, recipes, reminders, logbooks, maps, the, proper, sequence, for, a, complicated, task, or, important, ritual, dissemination, of, ideas, and, coordination, e, g, essays, monographs, broadsides, plans, petitions, or, manifestos, creativity, and, storytelling, maintaining, kinship, and, other, social, networks, business, correspondence, regarding, goods, and, services, and, life, writing, e, g, a, diary, or, journal, the, global, spread, of, digital, communication, systems, such, as, e, mail, and, social, media, has, made, writing, an, increasingly, important, feature, of, daily, life, where, these, systems, mix, with, older, technologies, like, paper, pencils, whiteboards, printers, and, copiers, substantial, amounts, of, everyday, writing, characterize, most, workplaces, in, developed, countries, in, many, occupations, e, g, law, accounting, software, design, human, resources, written, documentation, is, not, only, the, main, deliverable, but, also, the, mode, of, work, itself, even, in, occupations, not, typically, associated, with, writing, routine, records, management, has, most, employees, writing, at, least, some, of, the, time, some, professions, are, typically, associated, with, writing, such, as, literary, authors, journalists, and, technical, writers, but, writing, is, pervasive, in, most, modern, forms, of, work, civic, participation, household, management, and, leisure, activities, the, following, are, examples, of, this, pervasiveness, but, they, are, far, from, encompassing, all, the, uses, of, writing, writing, permeates, everyday, commerce, for, example, in, the, course, of, an, afternoon, a, wholesaler, might, receive, a, written, inquiry, about, the, availability, of, a, product, line, then, communicate, with, suppliers, and, fabricators, through, work, orders, and, purchase, agreements, correspond, via, email, to, affirm, shipping, availability, with, a, drayage, company, write, an, invoice, and, request, proof, of, receipt, in, the, form, of, a, written, signature, at, a, much, larger, scale, modern, systems, of, finances, banking, and, business, rest, on, many, forms, of, written, documents, including, written, regulations, policies, and, procedures, the, creation, of, reports, and, other, monitoring, documents, to, make, evaluate, and, provide, accountability, for, decisions, and, operations, the, creation, and, maintenance, of, records, internal, written, communications, within, departments, to, coordinate, work, written, communications, that, comprise, work, products, presented, to, other, departments, and, to, clients, and, external, communications, to, clients, and, the, public, business, and, financial, organizations, also, rely, on, many, written, legal, documents, such, as, contracts, reports, to, government, agencies, tax, records, and, accounting, reports, financial, institutions, and, markets, that, hold, transmit, trade, insure, or, regulate, holdings, for, clients, or, other, institutions, are, particularly, dependent, on, written, records, though, now, often, in, digital, form, to, maintain, the, integrity, of, their, roles, many, modern, systems, of, government, are, organized, and, sanctified, through, written, constitutions, at, the, national, and, sometimes, state, or, other, organizational, levels, written, rules, and, procedures, typically, guide, the, operations, of, the, various, branches, departments, and, other, bodies, of, government, which, regularly, produce, reports, and, other, documents, as, work, products, and, to, account, for, their, actions, in, addition, to, legislative, branches, that, draft, and, pass, laws, these, laws, are, administered, by, an, executive, branch, which, can, present, further, written, regulations, specifying, the, laws, and, how, they, are, carried, out, governments, at, different, levels, also, typically, maintain, written, records, on, citizens, concerning, identities, life, events, such, as, births, deaths, marriages, and, divorces, the, granting, of, licenses, for, controlled, activities, criminal, charges, traffic, offenses, and, other, penalties, small, and, large, and, tax, liability, and, payments, governance, systems, also, produce, policies, to, shape, society, s, activities, sometimes, also, at, the, international, level, e, g, allocating, budgets, and, regulating, or, actuating, economic, mechanisms, ideally, towards, collective, goals, and, values, such, as, safety, and, health, or, addressing, identified, problems, these, also, include, systems, at, subnational, levels, such, as, cities, and, multinational, corporations, e, g, corporate, governance, and, web, platform, governance, written, legal, codes, in, modern, governments, are, typically, produced, by, legislative, branches, and, provide, standardized, rules, for, commercial, civil, and, lawful, activity, the, legal, codes, also, provide, remedies, and, penalties, for, violations, of, the, rules, as, well, as, procedures, for, their, enforcement, in, the, united, states, legal, proceedings, in, courts, produce, written, records, which, can, be, appealed, based, on, the, written, records, to, higher, courts, written, records, carry, particular, evidentiary, weight, in, court, proceedings, lawyers, also, offer, written, briefs, for, initial, proceedings, subsequent, appeals, and, other, points, at, issue, maintain, files, on, the, cases, they, are, engaged, with, and, negotiate, written, agreements, that, might, resolve, cases, judges, produce, written, opinions, that, may, then, be, treated, as, precedent, for, subsequent, cases, police, departments, and, other, bodies, charged, with, the, enforcement, of, laws, and, maintenance, of, civil, commercial, or, criminal, order, regularly, must, produce, reports, of, the, interactions, with, community, members, actions, taken, the, process, and, results, of, inquiries, and, the, disposition, of, cases, such, cases, are, often, initiated, by, written, complaints, by, those, alleging, injury, thereby, opening, a, file, on, the, case, which, then, aggregates, all, the, related, documents, and, reports, to, follow, these, files, serve, as, the, basis, for, processing, the, case, as, potential, evidence, in, legal, proceedings, and, for, monitoring, and, making, accountable, the, working, of, these, departments, knowledge, produced, in, research, disciplines, of, the, sciences, social, sciences, and, humanities, arises, primarily, in, the, form, of, journal, articles, and, book, monographs, experiments, observational, data, archival, documents, and, other, evidence, collected, as, part, of, research, inquiries, are, then, represented, within, the, written, contribution, and, serve, as, the, basis, for, arguments, for, new, claims, intended, to, be, published, in, specialized, academic, journals, and, university, presses, such, data, collection, and, drafting, of, manuscripts, may, be, supported, by, grants, which, usually, require, proposals, establishing, the, value, of, such, work, and, the, need, for, funding, the, data, and, procedures, are, also, typically, collected, in, lab, notebooks, or, other, preliminary, files, early, versions, of, the, possible, publications, may, also, be, presented, at, academic, or, disciplinary, conferences, or, on, publicly, accessible, web, servers, to, gain, peer, feedback, and, build, interest, in, the, work, prior, to, official, publication, these, documents, are, typically, read, and, evaluated, by, referees, from, the, appropriate, research, specialties, who, in, their, written, evaluations, determine, whether, the, work, is, of, sufficient, value, and, quality, to, be, published, referees, may, also, recommend, certain, improvements, be, made, or, that, the, work, not, be, published, publication, in, such, a, disciplinary, forum, does, not, establish, the, claims, or, findings, of, such, work, as, authoritatively, true, only, that, they, are, worth, the, attention, of, other, specialists, only, over, time, as, others, may, cite, the, work, see, intertextuality, and, use, it, to, advance, further, claims, and, the, work, appears, in, review, articles, handbooks, textbooks, or, other, aggregations, does, it, become, codified, as, contingently, reliable, knowledge, scientific, or, scholarly, work, written, for, more, popular, audiences, relies, on, the, published, work, of, the, scientific, literature, for, its, authority, but, does, not, in, itself, directly, contribute, to, the, scientific, literature, news, and, news, reporting, are, central, to, citizen, engagement, and, knowledge, of, many, spheres, of, activity, people, may, be, interested, in, about, the, state, of, their, community, including, the, actions, and, integrity, of, their, governments, and, government, officials, economic, trends, natural, disasters, and, responses, to, them, international, geopolitical, events, including, conflicts, but, also, sports, entertainment, books, and, other, leisure, activities, while, news, and, newspapers, have, grown, rapidly, from, the, eighteenth, to, the, twentieth, centuries, the, changing, economics, and, ability, to, produce, and, distribute, news, have, brought, about, radical, and, rapid, challenges, to, journalism, and, the, consequent, organization, of, citizen, knowledge, and, engagement, these, changes, have, also, created, challenges, for, journalism, ethics, that, have, been, developed, over, the, past, century, technical, and, medical, writing, are, recognized, writing, specialties, that, address, the, needs, of, scientifically, and, technologically, based, professions, for, precise, accurate, and, timely, communications, internally, and, externally, for, the, audiences, the, professions, serve, internally, these, specialized, writers, ensure, that, communications, present, the, necessary, information, in, clear, and, precise, terms, to, people, in, various, roles, both, in, the, writing, they, do, and, with, the, support, they, provide, other, professionals, within, their, organizations, they, make, sure, that, each, person, within, the, organization, has, the, information, they, need, and, that, the, work, of, the, organization, is, coordinated, by, making, sure, all, necessary, tasks, are, assigned, and, carried, out, in, a, timely, and, accurate, way, through, various, media, and, genres, technical, and, medical, writers, elicit, the, goodwill, and, cooperation, of, the, public, served, while, informing, the, public, of, the, services, and, products, offered, instructions, needed, for, best, outcomes, and, other, information, technical, and, medical, writers, make, sure, appropriate, and, accurate, records, are, kept, for, internal, and, external, accountability, and, regulation, an, important, part, of, their, roles, is, to, prepare, reports, for, government, approval, and, monitoring, works, of, literature, encompass, written, fiction, poetry, autobiography, and, memoir, non, fiction, and, scripts, of, dramatic, cinematic, or, video, performance, and, hybridized, forms, of, some, or, all, of, those, previously, listed, works, of, literature, sell, widely, and, encompass, a, wide, substantial, market, provided, by, large, corporate, publishers, self, published, writers, and, everything, in, between, a, certain, subset, of, these, works, gain, scholarly, attention, and, are, taught, in, literature, classes, at, schools, at, all, levels, including, children, s, literature, young, adult, literature, and, canonical, literature, taught, at, universities, these, works, typically, become, the, subject, of, another, form, of, writing, academic, scholarship, other, forms, of, literature, that, are, widely, circulated, but, have, only, limited, scholarly, attention, include, historical, fiction, science, fiction, romance, fan, fiction, western, fiction, dystopic, and, apocalyptic, fiction, mystery, fiction, fantasy, and, myth, other, segments, of, the, book, market, include, non, fictional, works, that, some, may, not, characterize, as, literature, but, exist, within, the, same, marketing, space, such, as, popular, history, biography, and, autobiography, political, and, celebrity, memoirs, self, help, and, educational, books, popular, science, and, technology, accounts, of, social, problems, and, futuristic, projections, authors, and, publishers, agents, produce, considerable, documentation, preparatory, and, subsequent, to, the, successful, publication, of, literature, prospectuses, developmental, editing, notes, contracts, correspondence, with, potential, reviewers, press, releases, marketing, plans, etc, formal, education, is, the, social, context, most, strongly, associated, with, the, learning, of, writing, and, students, may, carry, these, particular, associations, long, after, leaving, school, alongside, the, writing, that, students, read, in, the, forms, of, textbooks, assigned, books, and, other, instructional, materials, as, well, as, self, selected, books, students, do, much, writing, within, schools, at, all, levels, on, subject, exams, in, essays, in, taking, notes, in, doing, homework, and, in, formative, and, summative, assessments, some, of, this, is, explicitly, directed, toward, the, learning, of, writing, but, much, is, focused, more, on, subject, learning, students, receive, much, writing, from, their, teachers, as, well, in, the, forms, of, assignments, and, syllabi, directions, for, activities, worksheets, corrections, on, work, or, information, about, subjects, or, exams, students, also, receive, institutional, notices, and, regulations, sometimes, to, be, shared, with, families, students, also, may, write, teacher, evaluations, for, use, by, teachers, to, improve, instruction, or, by, others, reviewing, quality, of, teacher, instruction, particularly, within, higher, education, writing, also, pervades, schools, and, educational, institutions, in, less, visible, and, memorable, ways, since, schools, are, typically, hierarchically, arranged, bureaucracies, writing, also, circulates, in, the, forms, of, notices, and, regulations, that, teachers, receive, from, their, supervisors, and, arrange, their, instruction, according, to, district, and, state, syllabi, and, regulations, teachers, often, must, produce, and, submit, lesson, plans, or, other, information, about, their, teaching, in, primary, and, secondary, education, teachers, may, need, to, write, notices, or, letters, to, parents, about, matters, relating, to, their, children, s, learning, school, activities, or, regulations, within, school, hierarchies, many, memos, notices, or, other, documents, may, flow, national, policies, and, regulations, as, elaborated, by, ministries, or, departments, of, education, may, also, be, of, consequence, additionally, research, in, the, various, subject, areas, and, in, educational, studies, may, be, attended, to, by, educators, in, the, classroom, and, higher, bureaucratic, levels, and, of, course, subject, learning, draws, on, the, knowledge, produced, and, authorized, by, disciplines, software, development, is, the, process, used, to, create, software, programming, and, maintaining, the, source, code, is, the, central, step, of, this, process, but, it, also, includes, conceiving, the, project, evaluating, its, feasibility, analyzing, the, business, requirements, software, design, testing, to, release, software, engineering, in, addition, to, development, also, includes, project, management, employee, management, and, other, overhead, functions, software, development, may, be, sequential, in, which, each, step, is, complete, before, the, next, begins, but, iterative, development, methods, where, multiple, steps, can, be, executed, at, once, and, earlier, steps, can, be, revisited, have, also, been, devised, to, improve, flexibility, efficiency, and, scheduling, writing, systems, may, be, broadly, classified, according, to, what, units, of, language, are, represented, by, its, symbols, alphabets, and, syllabaries, generally, represent, a, language, s, sounds, of, speech, phonemes, and, syllables, respectively, while, logographies, represent, a, language, s, units, of, meaning, words, or, morphemes, though, these, are, still, associated, by, readers, with, their, given, pronunciations, in, the, corresponding, spoken, language, a, logography, also, called, a, logosyllabary, is, written, using, logograms, written, characters, which, represent, individual, words, morphemes, or, certain, syllables, for, example, in, mayan, the, glyph, for, fin, pronounced, ka, was, also, used, to, represent, the, syllable, ka, whenever, the, pronunciation, of, a, logogram, needed, to, be, indicated, many, logograms, have, an, ideographic, component, chinese, radicals, hieroglyphic, determiners, in, chinese, about, 90, of, characters, are, compounds, of, a, semantic, meaning, element, called, a, radical, with, an, existing, character, to, indicate, the, pronunciation, called, a, phonetic, however, such, phonetic, elements, complement, the, logographic, elements, rather, than, vice, versa, the, main, logographic, system, in, use, today, is, chinese, characters, used, with, some, modification, for, the, various, languages, or, dialects, of, china, japan, and, sometimes, in, korean, although, in, south, and, north, korea, the, phonetic, hangul, system, is, mainly, used, other, logographic, systems, include, cuneiform, and, maya, a, syllabary, is, a, set, of, written, symbols, that, represent, syllables, typically, a, consonant, followed, by, a, vowel, or, just, a, vowel, alone, in, some, scripts, more, complex, syllables, such, as, consonant, vowel, consonant, or, consonant, consonant, vowel, may, have, dedicated, glyphs, phonetically, similar, syllables, are, not, written, similarly, for, instance, the, syllable, ka, may, look, nothing, like, the, syllable, ki, nor, will, syllables, with, the, same, vowels, be, similar, syllabaries, are, best, suited, to, languages, with, a, relatively, simple, syllable, structure, such, as, japanese, other, languages, that, use, syllabic, writing, include, the, linear, b, script, for, mycenaean, greek, cherokee, ndjuka, an, english, based, creole, language, of, suriname, and, the, vai, script, of, liberia, an, alphabet, is, a, set, of, written, symbols, that, represent, consonants, and, vowels, in, a, perfectly, phonological, alphabet, the, letters, would, correspond, perfectly, to, the, language, s, phonemes, thus, a, writer, could, predict, the, spelling, of, a, word, given, its, pronunciation, and, a, speaker, could, predict, the, pronunciation, of, a, word, given, its, spelling, however, as, languages, often, evolve, independently, of, their, writing, systems, and, writing, systems, have, been, borrowed, for, languages, they, were, not, designed, for, the, degree, to, which, letters, of, an, alphabet, correspond, to, phonemes, of, a, language, varies, greatly, from, one, language, to, another, and, even, within, a, single, language, sometimes, the, term, alphabet, is, restricted, to, systems, with, separate, letters, for, consonants, and, vowels, such, as, the, latin, alphabet, although, abugidas, and, abjads, may, also, be, accepted, as, alphabets, because, of, this, use, greek, is, often, considered, to, be, the, first, alphabet, in, most, of, the, alphabets, of, the, middle, east, it, is, usually, only, the, consonants, of, a, word, that, are, written, although, vowels, may, be, indicated, by, the, addition, of, various, diacritical, marks, writing, systems, based, primarily, on, writing, just, consonants, phonemes, date, back, to, the, hieroglyphs, of, ancient, egypt, such, systems, are, called, abjads, derived, from, the, arabic, word, for, alphabet, or, consonantaries, in, most, of, the, alphabets, of, india, and, southeast, asia, vowels, are, indicated, through, diacritics, or, modification, of, the, shape, of, the, consonant, these, are, called, abugidas, some, abugidas, such, as, ethiopic, and, cree, are, learned, by, children, as, syllabaries, and, so, are, often, called, syllabics, however, unlike, true, syllabaries, there, is, not, an, independent, glyph, for, each, syllable, a, featural, script, represents, the, features, of, the, phonemes, of, the, language, in, consistent, ways, an, example, of, such, a, system, is, korean, hangul, for, instance, all, labial, sounds, pronounced, with, the, lips, may, have, some, element, in, common, in, the, latin, alphabet, this, is, accidentally, the, case, with, the, letters, b, and, p, however, labial, m, is, completely, dissimilar, and, the, similar, looking, q, and, d, are, not, labial, in, korean, hangul, however, all, four, labial, consonants, are, based, on, the, same, basic, element, but, in, practice, korean, is, learned, by, children, as, an, ordinary, alphabet, and, the, featural, elements, tend, to, pass, unnoticed, another, featural, script, is, signwriting, the, most, popular, writing, system, for, many, sign, languages, where, the, shapes, and, movements, of, the, hands, and, face, are, represented, iconically, featural, scripts, are, also, common, in, fictional, or, invented, systems, such, as, j, r, r, tolkien, s, tengwar, while, research, into, the, development, of, writing, during, the, neolithic, is, ongoing, the, current, consensus, is, that, it, first, evolved, from, economic, necessity, in, the, ancient, near, east, writing, most, likely, began, as, a, consequence, of, political, expansion, in, ancient, cultures, which, needed, reliable, means, for, transmitting, information, maintaining, financial, accounts, keeping, historical, records, and, similar, activities, around, the, 4th, millennium, bc, the, complexity, of, trade, and, administration, outgrew, the, power, of, memory, and, writing, became, a, more, dependable, method, of, recording, and, presenting, transactions, in, a, permanent, form, the, invention, of, the, first, writing, systems, is, roughly, contemporary, with, the, emergence, of, civilisations, and, the, beginning, of, the, bronze, age, during, the, late, 4th, millennium, bc, cuneiform, used, to, write, the, sumerian, language, and, egyptian, hieroglyphs, are, generally, considered, the, earliest, writing, systems, both, emerging, out, of, ancestral, proto, writing, systems, between, 3400, and, 3300, bc, with, earliest, coherent, texts, from, c, 2600, bc, it, is, generally, agreed, that, sumerian, writing, was, an, independent, invention, however, it, is, debated, whether, egyptian, writing, was, developed, completely, independently, of, sumerian, or, was, a, case, of, cultural, diffusion, archaeologist, denise, schmandt, besserat, determined, the, link, between, previously, uncategorized, clay, tokens, the, oldest, of, which, have, been, found, in, the, zagros, region, of, iran, and, cuneiform, the, first, known, writing, around, 8000, bc, mesopotamians, began, using, clay, tokens, to, count, their, agricultural, and, manufactured, goods, later, they, began, placing, these, tokens, inside, large, hollow, clay, containers, bulla, or, globular, envelopes, which, were, then, sealed, the, quantity, of, tokens, in, each, container, came, to, be, expressed, by, impressing, on, the, container, s, surface, one, picture, for, each, instance, of, the, token, inside, they, next, dispensed, with, the, tokens, relying, solely, on, symbols, for, the, tokens, drawn, on, clay, surfaces, to, avoid, making, a, picture, for, each, instance, of, the, same, object, for, example, 100, pictures, of, a, hat, to, represent, 100, hats, they, counted, the, objects, by, using, various, small, marks, in, this, way, the, sumerians, added, a, system, for, enumerating, objects, to, their, incipient, system, of, symbols, the, original, mesopotamian, writing, system, was, derived, c, 3200, bc, from, this, method, of, keeping, accounts, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, millennium, bc, the, mesopotamians, were, using, a, triangular, shaped, stylus, pressed, into, soft, clay, to, record, numbers, this, system, was, gradually, augmented, with, using, a, sharp, stylus, to, indicate, what, was, being, counted, by, means, of, pictographs, round, stylus, and, sharp, stylus, writing, was, gradually, replaced, by, writing, using, a, wedge, shaped, stylus, hence, the, term, cuneiform, at, first, only, for, logograms, but, by, the, 29th, century, bc, also, for, phonetic, elements, around, 2700, bc, cuneiform, began, to, represent, syllables, of, spoken, sumerian, about, that, time, mesopotamian, cuneiform, became, a, general, purpose, writing, system, for, logograms, syllables, and, numbers, this, script, was, adapted, to, another, mesopotamian, language, the, east, semitic, akkadian, assyrian, and, babylonian, c, 2600, bc, and, then, to, others, such, as, elamite, hattian, hurrian, and, hittite, scripts, similar, in, appearance, to, this, writing, system, include, those, for, ugaritic, and, old, persian, with, the, adoption, of, aramaic, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, 911, 609, bc, old, aramaic, was, also, adapted, to, mesopotamian, cuneiform, the, last, cuneiform, scripts, in, akkadian, discovered, thus, far, date, from, the, 1st, century, ad, the, earliest, known, hieroglyphs, are, about, 5, 200, years, old, such, as, the, clay, labels, of, a, predynastic, ruler, called, scorpion, i, naqada, iiia, period, c, 32nd, century, bc, recovered, at, abydos, modern, umm, el, qa, ab, in, 1998, or, the, narmer, palette, dating, to, c, 3100, bc, and, several, recent, discoveries, that, may, be, slightly, older, though, these, glyphs, were, based, on, a, much, older, artistic, rather, than, written, tradition, the, hieroglyphic, script, was, logographic, with, phonetic, adjuncts, that, included, an, effective, alphabet, the, world, s, oldest, deciphered, sentence, was, found, on, a, seal, impression, found, in, the, tomb, of, seth, peribsen, at, umm, el, qa, ab, which, dates, from, the, second, dynasty, 28th, or, 27th, century, bc, there, are, around, 800, hieroglyphs, dating, back, to, the, old, kingdom, middle, kingdom, and, new, kingdom, eras, by, the, greco, roman, period, there, are, more, than, 5, 000, writing, was, very, important, in, maintaining, the, egyptian, empire, and, literacy, was, concentrated, among, an, educated, elite, of, scribes, only, people, from, certain, backgrounds, were, allowed, to, train, to, become, scribes, in, the, service, of, temple, pharaonic, and, military, authorities, the, hieroglyph, system, was, always, difficult, to, learn, but, in, later, centuries, was, purposely, made, even, more, so, as, this, preserved, the, scribes, status, the, world, s, oldest, known, alphabet, appears, to, have, been, developed, by, canaanite, turquoise, miners, in, the, sinai, desert, around, the, mid, 19th, century, bc, around, 30, crude, inscriptions, have, been, found, at, a, mountainous, egyptian, mining, site, known, as, serabit, el, khadem, this, site, was, also, home, to, a, temple, of, hathor, the, mistress, of, turquoise, a, later, two, line, inscription, has, also, been, found, at, wadi, el, hol, in, central, egypt, based, on, hieroglyphic, prototypes, but, also, including, entirely, new, symbols, each, sign, apparently, stood, for, a, consonant, rather, than, a, word, the, basis, of, an, alphabetic, system, it, was, not, until, the, 12th, to, 9th, centuries, however, that, the, alphabet, took, hold, and, became, widely, used, the, cascajal, block, a, stone, slab, with, 3, 000, year, old, proto, writing, was, discovered, in, the, mexican, state, of, veracruz, and, is, an, example, of, the, oldest, script, in, the, western, hemisphere, preceding, the, oldest, zapotec, writing, by, approximately, 500, years, it, is, thought, to, be, olmec, of, several, pre, columbian, scripts, in, mesoamerica, the, one, that, appears, to, have, been, best, developed, and, the, only, one, to, be, deciphered, is, the, maya, script, the, earliest, inscription, identified, as, maya, dates, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, maya, writing, used, logograms, complemented, by, a, set, of, syllabic, glyphs, somewhat, similar, in, function, to, modern, japanese, writing, in, 2001, archaeologists, discovered, that, there, was, a, civilization, in, central, asia, that, used, writing, c, 2000, bc, an, excavation, near, ashgabat, the, capital, of, turkmenistan, revealed, an, inscription, on, a, piece, of, stone, that, was, used, as, a, stamp, seal, the, earliest, surviving, examples, of, writing, in, china, inscriptions, on, oracle, bones, usually, tortoise, plastrons, and, ox, scapulae, which, were, used, for, divination, date, from, around, 1200, bc, during, the, late, shang, period, a, small, number, of, bronze, inscriptions, from, the, same, period, have, also, survived, in, 2003, archaeologists, reported, discoveries, of, isolated, tortoise, shell, carvings, dating, back, to, the, 7th, millennium, bc, but, whether, or, not, these, symbols, are, related, to, the, characters, of, the, later, oracle, bone, script, is, disputed, over, the, centuries, three, distinct, elamite, scripts, developed, proto, elamite, is, the, oldest, known, writing, system, from, iran, in, use, only, briefly, c, 3200, c, 2900, bc, clay, tablets, with, proto, elamite, writing, have, been, found, at, different, sites, across, iran, with, the, majority, having, been, excavated, at, susa, an, ancient, city, located, east, of, the, tigris, and, between, the, karkheh, and, dez, rivers, the, proto, elamite, script, is, thought, to, have, developed, from, early, cuneiform, proto, cuneiform, the, proto, elamite, script, consists, of, more, than, 1, 000, signs, and, is, thought, to, be, partly, logographic, linear, elamite, is, a, writing, system, attested, in, a, few, monumental, inscriptions, in, iran, it, was, used, for, a, very, brief, period, during, the, last, quarter, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, it, is, often, claimed, that, linear, elamite, is, a, syllabic, writing, system, derived, from, proto, elamite, although, this, cannot, be, proven, since, linear, elamite, has, not, been, deciphered, several, scholars, have, attempted, to, decipher, the, script, most, notably, walther, hinz, and, piero, meriggi, the, elamite, cuneiform, script, was, used, from, about, 2500, to, 331, bc, and, was, adapted, from, the, akkadian, cuneiform, at, any, given, point, within, this, period, the, elamite, cuneiform, script, consisted, of, about, 130, symbols, and, over, this, entire, period, only, 206, total, signs, were, used, this, is, far, fewer, than, most, other, cuneiform, scripts, cretan, hieroglyphs, are, found, on, artifacts, of, crete, early, to, mid, 2nd, millennium, bc, mm, i, to, mm, iii, overlapping, with, linear, a, from, mm, iia, at, the, earliest, linear, b, the, writing, system, of, the, mycenaean, greeks, has, been, deciphered, while, linear, a, has, yet, to, be, deciphered, the, sequence, and, the, geographical, spread, of, the, three, overlapping, but, distinct, writing, systems, can, be, summarized, as, follows, beginning, date, refers, to, first, attestations, the, assumed, origins, of, all, scripts, lie, further, back, in, the, past, cretan, hieroglyphs, were, used, in, crete, from, c, 1625, to, 1500, bc, linear, a, was, used, in, the, aegean, islands, kea, kythera, melos, thera, and, the, greek, mainland, laconia, from, c, 18th, century, to, 1450, bc, and, linear, b, was, used, in, crete, knossos, and, mainland, pylos, mycenae, thebes, tiryns, from, c, 1375, to, 1200, bc, indus, script, refers, to, short, strings, of, symbols, associated, with, the, indus, valley, civilization, which, spanned, modern, day, pakistan, and, north, india, used, between, 2600, and, 1900, bc, despite, attempts, at, decipherments, and, claims, it, is, as, yet, undeciphered, the, term, indus, script, is, mainly, applied, to, that, used, in, the, mature, harappan, phase, which, perhaps, evolved, from, a, few, signs, found, in, early, harappa, after, 3500, bc, the, script, is, written, from, right, to, left, and, sometimes, follows, a, boustrophedonic, style, in, 2015, the, epigrapher, bryan, wells, estimated, there, were, around, 694, distinct, signs, this, is, above, 400, so, scholars, accept, the, script, to, be, logo, syllabic, typically, syllabic, scripts, have, about, 50, 100, signs, whereas, logographic, scripts, have, a, very, large, number, of, principal, signs, several, scholars, maintain, that, structural, analysis, indicates, an, agglutinative, language, underlies, the, script, the, proto, sinaitic, script, in, which, proto, canaanite, is, believed, to, have, been, first, written, is, attested, as, far, back, as, the, 19th, century, bc, the, phoenician, writing, system, was, adapted, from, the, proto, canaanite, script, sometime, before, the, 14th, century, bc, which, in, turn, borrowed, principles, of, representing, phonetic, information, from, egyptian, hieroglyphs, this, writing, system, was, an, odd, sort, of, syllabary, in, which, only, consonants, are, represented, this, script, was, adapted, by, the, greeks, who, adapted, certain, consonantal, signs, to, represent, their, vowels, the, cumae, alphabet, a, variant, of, the, early, greek, alphabet, gave, rise, to, the, etruscan, alphabet, and, its, own, descendants, such, as, the, latin, alphabet, and, runes, other, descendants, from, the, greek, alphabet, include, cyrillic, used, to, write, bulgarian, russian, and, serbian, among, others, the, phoenician, system, was, also, adapted, into, the, aramaic, script, from, which, the, hebrew, and, the, arabic, scripts, are, descended, the, tifinagh, script, berber, languages, is, descended, from, the, libyco, berber, script, which, is, assumed, to, be, of, phoenician, origin, in, the, history, of, writing, religious, texts, or, writing, have, played, a, special, role, for, example, some, religious, text, compilations, have, been, some, of, the, earliest, popular, texts, or, even, the, only, written, texts, in, some, languages, and, in, some, cases, are, still, highly, popular, around, the, world, the, first, books, printed, widely, using, the, printing, press, were, bibles, such, texts, enabled, rapid, spread, and, maintenance, of, societal, cohesion, collective, identity, motivations, justifications, and, beliefs, that, e, g, notably, historically, supported, or, enabled, large, scale, warfare, between, modern, humans, multiple, programs, are, in, place, to, aid, both, children, and, adults, in, improving, their, literacy, skills, for, example, the, emergence, of, the, writing, center, and, community, wide, literacy, councils, aim, to, help, students, and, community, members, sharpen, their, writing, skills, these, resources, and, many, more, span, across, different, age, groups, in, order, to, offer, each, individual, a, better, understanding, of, their, language, and, how, to, express, themselves, via, writing, in, order, to, perhaps, improve, their, socioeconomic, status, as, william, j, farrell, puts, it, did, you, ever, notice, that, when, people, become, serious, about, communication, they, want, it, in, writing, other, parts, of, the, world, have, seen, an, increase, in, writing, abilities, as, a, result, of, programs, such, as, the, world, literacy, foundation, and, international, literacy, foundation, as, well, as, a, general, push, for, increased, global, communication
