a, language, family, is, a, group, of, languages, related, through, descent, from, a, common, ancestor, called, the, proto, language, of, that, family, the, term, family, is, a, metaphor, borrowed, from, biology, with, the, tree, model, used, in, historical, linguistics, analogous, to, a, family, tree, or, to, phylogenetic, trees, of, taxa, used, in, evolutionary, taxonomy, linguists, thus, describe, the, daughter, languages, within, a, language, family, as, being, genetically, related, the, divergence, of, a, proto, language, into, daughter, languages, typically, occurs, through, geographical, separation, with, different, regional, dialects, of, the, proto, language, undergoing, different, language, changes, and, thus, becoming, distinct, languages, over, time, one, well, known, example, of, a, language, family, is, the, romance, languages, including, spanish, french, italian, portuguese, romanian, catalan, and, many, others, all, of, which, are, descended, from, vulgar, latin, the, romance, family, itself, is, part, of, the, larger, indo, european, family, which, includes, many, other, languages, native, to, europe, and, south, asia, all, believed, to, have, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, known, as, proto, indo, european, a, language, family, is, usually, said, to, contain, at, least, two, languages, although, language, isolates, languages, that, are, not, related, to, any, other, language, are, occasionally, referred, to, as, families, that, contain, one, language, inversely, there, is, no, upper, bound, to, the, number, of, languages, a, family, can, contain, some, families, such, as, the, austronesian, languages, contain, over, 1000, language, families, can, be, identified, from, shared, characteristics, amongst, languages, sound, changes, are, one, of, the, strongest, pieces, of, evidence, that, can, be, used, to, identify, a, genetic, relationship, because, of, their, predictable, and, consistent, nature, and, through, the, comparative, method, can, be, used, to, reconstruct, proto, languages, however, languages, can, also, change, through, language, contact, which, can, falsely, suggest, genetic, relationships, for, example, the, mongolic, tungusic, and, turkic, languages, share, a, great, deal, of, similarities, that, lead, several, scholars, to, believe, they, were, related, these, supposed, relationships, were, later, discovered, to, be, derived, through, language, contact, and, thus, they, are, not, truly, related, eventually, though, high, amounts, of, language, contact, and, inconsistent, changes, will, render, it, essentially, impossible, to, derive, any, more, relationships, even, the, oldest, language, family, afroasiatic, is, far, younger, than, language, itself, estimates, of, the, number, of, language, families, in, the, world, may, vary, widely, according, to, ethnologue, there, are, 7, 151, living, human, languages, distributed, in, 142, different, language, families, lyle, campbell, 2019, identifies, a, total, of, 406, independent, language, families, including, isolates, ethnologue, 27, 2024, lists, the, following, families, that, contain, at, least, 1, of, the, 7, 164, known, languages, in, the, world, glottolog, 5, 0, 2024, lists, the, following, as, the, largest, families, of, 7, 788, languages, other, than, sign, languages, pidgins, and, unclassifiable, languages, language, counts, can, vary, significantly, depending, on, what, is, considered, a, dialect, for, example, lyle, campbell, counts, only, 27, otomanguean, languages, although, he, ethnologue, and, glottolog, also, disagree, as, to, which, languages, belong, in, the, family, two, languages, have, a, genetic, relationship, and, belong, to, the, same, language, family, if, both, are, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, through, the, process, of, language, change, or, one, is, descended, from, the, other, the, term, and, the, process, of, language, evolution, are, independent, of, and, not, reliant, on, the, terminology, understanding, and, theories, related, to, genetics, in, the, biological, sense, so, to, avoid, confusion, some, linguists, prefer, the, term, genealogical, relationship, 184, there, is, a, remarkably, similar, pattern, shown, by, the, linguistic, tree, and, the, genetic, tree, of, human, ancestry, that, was, verified, statistically, languages, interpreted, in, terms, of, the, putative, phylogenetic, tree, of, human, languages, are, transmitted, to, a, great, extent, vertically, by, ancestry, as, opposed, to, horizontally, by, spatial, diffusion, in, some, cases, the, shared, derivation, of, a, group, of, related, languages, from, a, common, ancestor, is, directly, attested, in, the, historical, record, for, example, this, is, the, case, for, the, romance, language, family, wherein, spanish, italian, portuguese, romanian, and, french, are, all, descended, from, latin, as, well, as, for, the, north, germanic, language, family, including, danish, swedish, norwegian, and, icelandic, which, have, shared, descent, from, ancient, norse, latin, and, ancient, norse, are, both, attested, in, written, records, as, are, many, intermediate, stages, between, those, ancestral, languages, and, their, modern, descendants, in, other, cases, genetic, relationships, between, languages, are, not, directly, attested, for, instance, the, romance, languages, and, the, north, germanic, languages, are, also, related, to, each, other, being, subfamilies, of, the, indo, european, language, family, since, both, latin, and, old, norse, are, believed, to, be, descended, from, an, even, more, ancient, language, proto, indo, european, however, no, direct, evidence, of, proto, indo, european, or, its, divergence, into, its, descendant, languages, survives, in, cases, such, as, these, genetic, relationships, are, established, through, use, of, the, comparative, method, of, linguistic, analysis, in, order, to, test, the, hypothesis, that, two, languages, are, related, the, comparative, method, begins, with, the, collection, of, pairs, of, words, that, are, hypothesized, to, be, cognates, i, e, words, in, related, languages, that, are, derived, from, the, same, word, in, the, shared, ancestral, language, pairs, of, words, that, have, similar, pronunciations, and, meanings, in, the, two, languages, are, often, good, candidates, for, hypothetical, cognates, the, researcher, must, rule, out, the, possibility, that, the, two, words, are, similar, merely, due, to, chance, or, due, to, one, having, borrowed, the, words, from, the, other, or, from, a, language, related, to, the, other, chance, resemblance, is, ruled, out, by, the, existence, of, large, collections, of, pairs, of, words, between, the, two, languages, showing, similar, patterns, of, phonetic, similarity, once, coincidental, similarity, and, borrowing, have, been, eliminated, as, possible, explanations, for, similarities, in, sound, and, meaning, of, words, the, remaining, explanation, is, common, origin, it, is, inferred, that, the, similarities, occurred, due, to, descent, from, a, common, ancestor, and, the, words, are, actually, cognates, implying, the, languages, must, be, related, when, languages, are, in, contact, with, one, another, either, of, them, may, influence, the, other, through, linguistic, interference, such, as, borrowing, for, example, french, has, influenced, english, arabic, has, influenced, persian, sanskrit, has, influenced, tamil, and, chinese, has, influenced, japanese, in, this, way, however, such, influence, does, not, constitute, and, is, not, a, measure, of, a, genetic, relationship, between, the, languages, concerned, linguistic, interference, can, occur, between, languages, that, are, genetically, closely, related, between, languages, that, are, distantly, related, like, english, and, french, which, are, distantly, related, indo, european, languages, and, between, languages, that, have, no, genetic, relationship, some, exceptions, to, the, simple, genetic, relationship, model, of, languages, include, language, isolates, and, mixed, pidgin, and, creole, languages, mixed, languages, pidgins, and, creole, languages, constitute, special, genetic, types, of, languages, they, do, not, descend, linearly, or, directly, from, a, single, language, and, have, no, single, ancestor, isolates, are, languages, that, cannot, be, proven, to, be, genealogically, related, to, any, other, modern, language, as, a, corollary, every, language, isolate, also, forms, its, own, language, family, a, genetic, family, which, happens, to, consist, of, just, one, language, one, often, cited, example, is, basque, which, forms, a, language, family, on, its, own, but, there, are, many, other, examples, outside, europe, on, the, global, scale, the, site, glottolog, counts, a, total, of, 423, language, families, in, the, world, including, 184, isolates, one, controversial, theory, concerning, the, genetic, relationships, among, languages, is, monogenesis, the, idea, that, all, known, languages, with, the, exceptions, of, creoles, pidgins, and, sign, languages, are, descendant, from, a, single, ancestral, language, if, that, is, true, it, would, mean, all, languages, other, than, pidgins, creoles, and, sign, languages, are, genetically, related, but, in, many, cases, the, relationships, may, be, too, remote, to, be, detectable, alternative, explanations, for, some, basic, observed, commonalities, between, languages, include, developmental, theories, related, to, the, biological, development, of, the, capacity, for, language, as, the, child, grows, from, newborn, a, language, family, is, a, monophyletic, unit, all, its, members, derive, from, a, common, ancestor, and, all, descendants, of, that, ancestor, are, included, in, the, family, thus, the, term, family, is, analogous, to, the, biological, term, clade, language, families, can, be, divided, into, smaller, phylogenetic, units, sometimes, referred, to, as, branches, or, subfamilies, of, the, family, for, instance, the, germanic, languages, are, a, subfamily, of, the, indo, european, family, subfamilies, share, a, more, recent, common, ancestor, than, the, common, ancestor, of, the, larger, family, proto, germanic, the, common, ancestor, of, the, germanic, subfamily, was, itself, a, descendant, of, proto, indo, european, the, common, ancestor, of, the, indo, european, family, within, a, large, family, subfamilies, can, be, identified, through, shared, innovations, members, of, a, subfamily, will, share, features, that, represent, retentions, from, their, more, recent, common, ancestor, but, were, not, present, in, the, overall, proto, language, of, the, larger, family, some, taxonomists, restrict, the, term, family, to, a, certain, level, but, there, is, little, consensus, on, how, to, do, so, those, who, affix, such, labels, also, subdivide, branches, into, groups, and, groups, into, complexes, a, top, level, i, e, the, largest, family, is, often, called, a, phylum, or, stock, the, closer, the, branches, are, to, each, other, the, more, closely, the, languages, will, be, related, this, means, if, a, branch, of, a, proto, language, is, four, branches, down, and, there, is, also, a, sister, language, to, that, fourth, branch, then, the, two, sister, languages, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, that, common, ancestral, proto, language, the, term, macrofamily, or, superfamily, is, sometimes, applied, to, proposed, groupings, of, language, families, whose, status, as, phylogenetic, units, is, generally, considered, to, be, unsubstantiated, by, accepted, historical, linguistic, methods, some, close, knit, language, families, and, many, branches, within, larger, families, take, the, form, of, dialect, continua, in, which, there, are, no, clear, cut, borders, that, make, it, possible, to, unequivocally, identify, define, or, count, individual, languages, within, the, family, however, when, the, differences, between, the, speech, of, different, regions, at, the, extremes, of, the, continuum, are, so, great, that, there, is, no, mutual, intelligibility, between, them, as, occurs, in, arabic, the, continuum, cannot, meaningfully, be, seen, as, a, single, language, a, speech, variety, may, also, be, considered, either, a, language, or, a, dialect, depending, on, social, or, political, considerations, thus, different, sources, especially, over, time, can, give, wildly, different, numbers, of, languages, within, a, certain, family, classifications, of, the, japonic, family, for, example, range, from, one, language, a, language, isolate, with, dialects, to, nearly, twenty, until, the, classification, of, ryukyuan, as, separate, languages, within, a, japonic, language, family, rather, than, dialects, of, japanese, the, japanese, language, itself, was, considered, a, language, isolate, and, therefore, the, only, language, in, its, family, most, of, the, world, s, languages, are, known, to, be, related, to, others, those, that, have, no, known, relatives, or, for, which, family, relationships, are, only, tentatively, proposed, are, called, language, isolates, essentially, language, families, consisting, of, a, single, language, there, are, an, estimated, 129, language, isolates, known, today, an, example, is, basque, in, general, it, is, assumed, that, language, isolates, have, relatives, or, had, relatives, at, some, point, in, their, history, but, at, a, time, depth, too, great, for, linguistic, comparison, to, recover, them, a, language, isolate, is, classified, based, on, the, fact, that, enough, is, known, about, the, isolate, to, compare, it, genetically, to, other, languages, but, no, common, ancestry, or, relationship, is, found, with, any, other, known, language, a, language, isolated, in, its, own, branch, within, a, family, such, as, albanian, and, armenian, within, indo, european, is, often, also, called, an, isolate, but, the, meaning, of, the, word, isolate, in, such, cases, is, usually, clarified, with, a, modifier, for, instance, albanian, and, armenian, may, be, referred, to, as, an, indo, european, isolate, by, contrast, so, far, as, is, known, the, basque, language, is, an, absolute, isolate, it, has, not, been, shown, to, be, related, to, any, other, modern, language, despite, numerous, attempts, a, language, may, be, said, to, be, an, isolate, currently, but, not, historically, if, related, but, now, extinct, relatives, are, attested, the, aquitanian, language, spoken, in, roman, times, may, have, been, an, ancestor, of, basque, but, it, could, also, have, been, a, sister, language, to, the, ancestor, of, basque, in, the, latter, case, basque, and, aquitanian, would, form, a, small, family, together, ancestors, are, not, considered, to, be, distinct, members, of, a, family, a, proto, language, can, be, thought, of, as, a, mother, language, not, to, be, confused, with, a, mother, tongue, being, the, root, from, which, all, languages, in, the, family, stem, the, common, ancestor, of, a, language, family, is, seldom, known, directly, since, most, languages, have, a, relatively, short, recorded, history, however, it, is, possible, to, recover, many, features, of, a, proto, language, by, applying, the, comparative, method, a, reconstructive, procedure, worked, out, by, 19th, century, linguist, august, schleicher, this, can, demonstrate, the, validity, of, many, of, the, proposed, families, in, the, list, of, language, families, for, example, the, reconstructible, common, ancestor, of, the, indo, european, language, family, is, called, proto, indo, european, proto, indo, european, is, not, attested, by, written, records, and, so, is, conjectured, to, have, been, spoken, before, the, invention, of, writing, a, common, visual, representation, of, a, language, family, is, given, by, a, genetic, language, tree, the, tree, model, is, sometimes, termed, a, dendrogram, or, phylogeny, the, family, tree, shows, the, relationship, of, the, languages, within, a, family, much, as, a, family, tree, of, an, individual, shows, their, relationship, with, their, relatives, there, are, criticisms, to, the, family, tree, model, critics, focus, mainly, on, the, claim, that, the, internal, structure, of, the, trees, is, subject, to, variation, based, on, the, criteria, of, classification, even, among, those, who, support, the, family, tree, model, there, are, debates, over, which, languages, should, be, included, in, a, language, family, for, example, within, the, dubious, altaic, language, family, there, are, debates, over, whether, the, japonic, and, koreanic, languages, should, be, included, or, not, the, wave, model, has, been, proposed, as, an, alternative, to, the, tree, model, the, wave, model, uses, isoglosses, to, group, language, varieties, unlike, in, the, tree, model, these, groups, can, overlap, while, the, tree, model, implies, a, lack, of, contact, between, languages, after, derivation, from, an, ancestral, form, the, wave, model, emphasizes, the, relationship, between, languages, that, remain, in, contact, which, is, more, realistic, historical, glottometry, is, an, application, of, the, wave, model, meant, to, identify, and, evaluate, genetic, relations, in, linguistic, linkages, a, sprachbund, is, a, geographic, area, having, several, languages, that, feature, common, linguistic, structures, the, similarities, between, those, languages, are, caused, by, language, contact, not, by, chance, or, common, origin, and, are, not, recognized, as, criteria, that, define, a, language, family, an, example, of, a, sprachbund, would, be, the, indian, subcontinent, shared, innovations, acquired, by, borrowing, or, other, means, are, not, considered, genetic, and, have, no, bearing, with, the, language, family, concept, it, has, been, asserted, for, example, that, many, of, the, more, striking, features, shared, by, italic, languages, latin, oscan, umbrian, etc, might, well, be, areal, features, however, very, similar, looking, alterations, in, the, systems, of, long, vowels, in, the, west, germanic, languages, greatly, postdate, any, possible, notion, of, a, proto, language, innovation, and, cannot, readily, be, regarded, as, areal, either, since, english, and, continental, west, germanic, were, not, a, linguistic, area, in, a, similar, vein, there, are, many, similar, unique, innovations, in, germanic, baltic, and, slavic, that, are, far, more, likely, to, be, areal, features, than, traceable, to, a, common, proto, language, but, legitimate, uncertainty, about, whether, shared, innovations, are, areal, features, coincidence, or, inheritance, from, a, common, ancestor, leads, to, disagreement, over, the, proper, subdivisions, of, any, large, language, family, the, concept, of, language, families, is, based, on, the, historical, observation, that, languages, develop, dialects, which, over, time, may, diverge, into, distinct, languages, however, linguistic, ancestry, is, less, clear, cut, than, familiar, biological, ancestry, in, which, species, do, not, crossbreed, it, is, more, like, the, evolution, of, microbes, with, extensive, lateral, gene, transfer, quite, distantly, related, languages, may, affect, each, other, through, language, contact, which, in, extreme, cases, may, lead, to, languages, with, no, single, ancestor, whether, they, be, creoles, or, mixed, languages, in, addition, a, number, of, sign, languages, have, developed, in, isolation, and, appear, to, have, no, relatives, at, all, nonetheless, such, cases, are, relatively, rare, and, most, well, attested, languages, can, be, unambiguously, classified, as, belonging, to, one, language, family, or, another, even, if, this, family, s, relation, to, other, families, is, not, known, language, contact, can, lead, to, the, development, of, new, languages, from, the, mixture, of, two, or, more, languages, for, the, purposes, of, interactions, between, two, groups, who, speak, different, languages, languages, that, arise, in, order, for, two, groups, to, communicate, with, each, other, to, engage, in, commercial, trade, or, that, appeared, as, a, result, of, colonialism, are, called, pidgin, pidgins, are, an, example, of, linguistic, and, cultural, expansion, caused, by, language, contact, however, language, contact, can, also, lead, to, cultural, divisions, in, some, cases, two, different, language, speaking, groups, can, feel, territorial, towards, their, language, and, do, not, want, any, changes, to, be, made, to, it, this, causes, language, boundaries, and, groups, in, contact, are, not, willing, to, make, any, compromises, to, accommodate, the, other, language
