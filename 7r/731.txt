anxiety, is, an, emotion, which, is, characterised, by, an, unpleasant, state, of, inner, turmoil, and, includes, feelings, of, dread, over, anticipated, events, anxiety, is, different, from, fear, in, that, fear, is, defined, as, the, emotional, response, to, a, present, threat, whereas, anxiety, is, the, anticipation, of, a, future, one, it, is, often, accompanied, by, nervous, behavior, such, as, pacing, back, and, forth, somatic, complaints, and, rumination, anxiety, is, a, feeling, of, uneasiness, and, worry, usually, generalized, and, unfocused, as, an, overreaction, to, a, situation, that, is, only, subjectively, seen, as, menacing, it, is, often, accompanied, by, muscular, tension, restlessness, fatigue, inability, to, catch, one, s, breath, tightness, in, the, abdominal, region, nausea, and, problems, in, concentration, anxiety, is, closely, related, to, fear, which, is, a, response, to, a, real, or, perceived, immediate, threat, fight, or, flight, response, anxiety, involves, the, expectation, of, a, future, threat, including, dread, people, facing, anxiety, may, withdraw, from, situations, which, have, provoked, anxiety, in, the, past, the, emotion, of, anxiety, can, persist, beyond, the, developmentally, appropriate, time, periods, in, response, to, specific, events, and, thus, turning, into, one, of, the, multiple, anxiety, disorders, e, g, generalized, anxiety, disorder, panic, disorder, the, difference, between, anxiety, disorder, as, mental, disorder, and, anxiety, as, normal, emotion, is, that, people, with, an, anxiety, disorder, experience, anxiety, excessively, or, persistently, during, approximately, 6, months, or, even, during, shorter, time, periods, in, children, anxiety, disorders, are, among, the, most, persistent, mental, problems, and, often, last, decades, anxiety, can, also, be, experienced, within, other, mental, disorders, e, g, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, anxiety, is, distinguished, from, fear, which, is, an, appropriate, cognitive, and, emotional, response, to, a, perceived, threat, anxiety, is, related, to, the, specific, behaviors, of, fight, or, flight, responses, defensive, behavior, or, escape, there, is, a, false, presumption, that, often, circulates, that, anxiety, only, occurs, in, situations, perceived, as, uncontrollable, or, unavoidable, but, this, is, not, always, so, david, barlow, defines, anxiety, as, a, future, oriented, mood, state, in, which, one, is, not, ready, or, prepared, to, attempt, to, cope, with, upcoming, negative, events, and, that, it, is, a, distinction, between, future, and, present, dangers, which, divides, anxiety, and, fear, another, description, of, anxiety, is, agony, dread, terror, or, even, apprehension, in, positive, psychology, anxiety, is, described, as, the, mental, state, that, results, from, a, difficult, challenge, for, which, the, subject, has, insufficient, coping, skills, fear, and, anxiety, can, be, differentiated, into, four, domains, 1, duration, of, emotional, experience, 2, temporal, focus, 3, specificity, of, the, threat, and, 4, motivated, direction, fear, is, short, lived, present, focused, geared, towards, a, specific, threat, and, facilitating, escape, from, threat, on, the, other, hand, anxiety, is, long, acting, future, focused, broadly, focused, towards, a, diffuse, threat, and, promoting, excessive, caution, while, approaching, a, potential, threat, and, interferes, with, constructive, coping, joseph, e, ledoux, and, lisa, feldman, barrett, have, both, sought, to, separate, automatic, threat, responses, from, additional, associated, cognitive, activity, within, anxiety, anxiety, can, be, experienced, with, long, drawn, out, daily, symptoms, that, reduce, quality, of, life, known, as, chronic, or, generalized, anxiety, or, it, can, be, experienced, in, short, spurts, with, sporadic, stressful, panic, attacks, known, as, acute, anxiety, symptoms, of, anxiety, can, range, in, number, intensity, and, frequency, depending, on, the, person, however, most, people, do, not, suffer, from, chronic, anxiety, anxiety, can, induce, several, psychological, pains, e, g, depression, or, mental, disorders, and, may, lead, to, self, harm, or, suicide, the, behavioral, effects, of, anxiety, may, include, withdrawal, from, situations, which, have, provoked, anxiety, or, negative, feelings, in, the, past, other, effects, may, include, changes, in, sleeping, patterns, changes, in, habits, increase, or, decrease, in, food, intake, and, increased, motor, tension, such, as, foot, tapping, the, emotional, effects, of, anxiety, may, include, feelings, of, apprehension, or, dread, trouble, concentrating, feeling, tense, or, jumpy, anticipating, the, worst, irritability, restlessness, watching, for, signs, of, danger, and, a, feeling, of, empty, mindedness, as, well, as, nightmares, bad, dreams, obsessions, about, sensations, d, j, vu, a, trapped, in, your, mind, feeling, and, feeling, like, everything, is, scary, it, may, include, a, vague, experience, and, feeling, of, helplessness, the, cognitive, effects, of, anxiety, may, include, thoughts, about, suspected, dangers, such, as, an, irrational, fear, of, dying, or, having, a, heart, attack, when, in, reality, all, one, is, experiencing, is, mild, chest, pain, for, example, the, physiological, symptoms, of, anxiety, may, include, there, are, various, types, of, anxiety, existential, anxiety, can, occur, when, a, person, faces, angst, an, existential, crisis, or, nihilistic, feelings, people, can, also, face, mathematical, anxiety, somatic, anxiety, stage, fright, or, test, anxiety, social, anxiety, refers, to, a, fear, of, rejection, and, negative, evaluation, being, judged, by, other, people, the, philosopher, s, ren, kierkegaard, in, the, concept, of, anxiety, 1844, described, anxiety, or, dread, associated, with, the, dizziness, of, freedom, and, suggested, the, possibility, for, positive, resolution, of, anxiety, through, the, self, conscious, exercise, of, responsibility, and, choosing, in, art, and, artist, 1932, the, psychologist, otto, rank, wrote, that, the, psychological, trauma, of, birth, was, the, pre, eminent, human, symbol, of, existential, anxiety, and, encompasses, the, creative, person, s, simultaneous, fear, of, and, desire, for, separation, individuation, and, differentiation, the, theologian, paul, tillich, characterized, existential, anxiety, as, the, state, in, which, a, being, is, aware, of, its, possible, nonbeing, and, he, listed, three, categories, for, the, nonbeing, and, resulting, anxiety, ontic, fate, and, death, moral, guilt, and, condemnation, and, spiritual, emptiness, and, meaninglessness, according, to, tillich, the, last, of, these, three, types, of, existential, anxiety, i, e, spiritual, anxiety, is, predominant, in, modern, times, while, the, others, were, predominant, in, earlier, periods, tillich, argues, that, this, anxiety, can, be, accepted, as, part, of, the, human, condition, or, it, can, be, resisted, but, with, negative, consequences, in, its, pathological, form, spiritual, anxiety, may, tend, to, drive, the, person, toward, the, creation, of, certitude, in, systems, of, meaning, which, are, supported, by, tradition, and, authority, even, though, such, undoubted, certitude, is, not, built, on, the, rock, of, reality, according, to, viktor, frankl, the, author, of, man, s, search, for, meaning, when, a, person, is, faced, with, extreme, mortal, dangers, the, most, basic, of, all, human, wishes, is, to, find, a, meaning, of, life, to, combat, the, trauma, of, nonbeing, as, death, is, near, depending, on, the, source, of, the, threat, psychoanalytic, theory, distinguishes, three, types, of, anxiety, realistic, neurotic, and, moral, according, to, yerkes, dodson, law, an, optimal, level, of, arousal, is, necessary, to, best, complete, a, task, such, as, an, exam, performance, or, competitive, event, however, when, the, anxiety, or, level, of, arousal, exceeds, that, optimum, the, result, is, a, decline, in, performance, test, anxiety, is, the, uneasiness, apprehension, or, nervousness, felt, by, students, who, have, a, fear, of, failing, an, exam, students, who, have, test, anxiety, may, experience, any, of, the, following, the, association, of, grades, with, personal, worth, fear, of, embarrassment, by, a, teacher, fear, of, alienation, from, parents, or, friends, time, pressures, or, feeling, a, loss, of, control, sweating, dizziness, headaches, racing, heartbeats, nausea, fidgeting, uncontrollable, crying, or, laughing, and, drumming, on, a, desk, are, all, common, because, test, anxiety, hinges, on, fear, of, negative, evaluation, debate, exists, as, to, whether, test, anxiety, is, itself, a, unique, anxiety, disorder, or, whether, it, is, a, specific, type, of, social, phobia, the, dsm, iv, classifies, test, anxiety, as, a, type, of, social, phobia, research, indicates, that, test, anxiety, among, u, s, high, school, and, college, students, has, been, rising, since, the, late, 1950s, test, anxiety, remains, a, challenge, for, students, regardless, of, age, and, has, considerable, physiological, and, psychological, impacts, management, of, test, anxiety, focuses, on, achieving, relaxation, and, developing, mechanisms, to, manage, anxiety, the, routine, practice, of, slow, device, guided, breathing, dgb, is, a, major, component, of, behavioral, treatments, for, anxiety, conditions, performance, anxiety, and, competitive, anxiety, competitive, trait, anxiety, competitive, state, anxiety, happen, when, an, individual, s, performance, is, measured, against, others, an, important, distinction, between, competitive, and, non, competitive, anxiety, is, that, competitive, anxiety, makes, people, view, their, performance, as, a, threat, as, a, result, they, experience, a, drop, in, their, ordinary, ability, whether, physical, or, mental, due, to, that, perceived, stress, competitive, anxiety, is, caused, by, a, range, of, internal, factors, including, high, expectations, outside, pressure, lack, of, experience, and, external, factors, like, the, location, of, a, competition, it, commonly, occurs, in, those, participating, in, high, pressure, activities, like, sports, and, debates, some, common, symptoms, of, competitive, anxiety, include, muscle, tension, fatigue, weakness, sense, of, panic, apprehensiveness, and, panic, attacks, there, are, 4, major, theories, of, how, anxiety, affects, performance, drive, theory, inverted, u, theory, reversal, theory, and, the, zone, of, optimal, functioning, theory, drive, theory, believes, that, anxiety, is, positive, and, performance, improves, proportionally, to, the, level, of, anxiety, this, theory, is, not, well, accepted, the, inverted, u, theory, is, based, on, the, idea, that, performance, peaks, at, a, moderate, stress, level, it, is, called, inverted, u, theory, because, the, graph, that, plots, performance, against, anxiety, looks, like, an, inverted, u, reversal, theory, suggests, that, performance, increases, in, relation, to, the, individual, s, interpretation, of, their, arousal, levels, if, they, believed, their, physical, arousal, level, would, help, them, their, performance, would, increase, if, they, didn, t, their, performance, would, decrease, for, example, athletes, were, shown, to, worry, more, when, focusing, on, results, and, perfection, rather, than, the, effort, and, growth, involved, the, zone, of, optimal, functioning, theory, proposes, that, there, is, a, zone, where, positive, and, negative, emotions, are, in, a, balance, which, lead, to, feelings, of, dissociation, and, intense, concentration, optimizing, the, individual, s, performance, levels, humans, generally, require, social, acceptance, and, thus, sometimes, dread, the, disapproval, of, others, apprehension, of, being, judged, by, others, may, cause, anxiety, in, social, environments, anxiety, during, social, interactions, particularly, between, strangers, is, common, among, young, people, it, may, persist, into, adulthood, and, become, social, anxiety, or, social, phobia, stranger, anxiety, in, small, children, is, not, considered, a, phobia, in, adults, an, excessive, fear, of, other, people, is, not, a, developmentally, common, stage, it, is, called, social, anxiety, according, to, cutting, social, phobics, do, not, fear, the, crowd, but, the, fact, that, they, may, be, judged, negatively, social, anxiety, varies, in, degree, and, severity, for, some, people, it, is, characterized, by, experiencing, discomfort, or, awkwardness, during, physical, social, contact, e, g, embracing, shaking, hands, etc, while, in, other, cases, it, can, lead, to, a, fear, of, interacting, with, unfamiliar, people, altogether, those, with, this, condition, may, restrict, their, lifestyles, to, accommodate, the, anxiety, minimizing, social, interaction, whenever, possible, social, anxiety, also, forms, a, core, aspect, of, certain, personality, disorders, including, avoidant, personality, disorder, to, the, extent, that, a, person, is, fearful, of, social, encounters, with, unfamiliar, others, some, people, may, experience, anxiety, particularly, during, interactions, with, outgroup, members, or, people, who, share, different, group, memberships, i, e, by, race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, antecedent, relations, cognitions, and, situational, factors, intergroup, contact, may, be, stressful, and, lead, to, feelings, of, anxiety, this, apprehension, or, fear, of, contact, with, outgroup, members, is, often, called, interracial, or, intergroup, anxiety, as, is, the, case, with, the, more, generalized, forms, of, social, anxiety, intergroup, anxiety, has, behavioral, cognitive, and, affective, effects, for, instance, increases, in, schematic, processing, and, simplified, information, processing, can, occur, when, anxiety, is, high, indeed, such, is, consistent, with, related, work, on, attentional, bias, in, implicit, memory, additionally, recent, research, has, found, that, implicit, racial, evaluations, i, e, automatic, prejudiced, attitudes, can, be, amplified, during, intergroup, interaction, negative, experiences, have, been, illustrated, in, producing, not, only, negative, expectations, but, also, avoidant, or, antagonistic, behavior, such, as, hostility, furthermore, when, compared, to, anxiety, levels, and, cognitive, effort, e, g, impression, management, and, self, presentation, in, intragroup, contexts, levels, and, depletion, of, resources, may, be, exacerbated, in, the, intergroup, situation, anxiety, can, be, either, a, short, term, state, or, a, long, term, personality, trait, trait, anxiety, reflects, a, stable, tendency, across, the, lifespan, of, responding, with, acute, state, anxiety, in, the, anticipation, of, threatening, situations, whether, they, are, actually, deemed, threatening, or, not, a, meta, analysis, showed, that, a, high, level, of, neuroticism, is, a, risk, factor, for, development, of, anxiety, symptoms, and, disorders, such, anxiety, may, be, conscious, or, unconscious, personality, can, also, be, a, trait, leading, to, anxiety, and, depression, and, their, persistence, through, experience, many, find, it, difficult, to, collect, themselves, due, to, their, own, personal, nature, anxiety, induced, by, the, need, to, choose, between, similar, options, is, recognized, as, a, problem, for, some, individuals, and, for, organizations, in, 2004, capgemini, wrote, today, we, re, all, faced, with, greater, choice, more, competition, and, less, time, to, consider, our, options, or, seek, out, the, right, advice, overthinking, a, choice, is, called, analysis, paralysis, in, a, decision, context, unpredictability, or, uncertainty, may, trigger, emotional, responses, in, anxious, individuals, that, systematically, alter, decision, making, there, are, primarily, two, forms, of, this, anxiety, type, the, first, form, refers, to, a, choice, in, which, there, are, multiple, potential, outcomes, with, known, or, calculable, probabilities, the, second, form, refers, to, the, uncertainty, and, ambiguity, related, to, a, decision, context, in, which, there, are, multiple, possible, outcomes, with, unknown, probabilities, panic, disorder, may, share, symptoms, of, stress, and, anxiety, but, it, is, actually, very, different, panic, disorder, is, an, anxiety, disorder, that, occurs, without, any, triggers, according, to, the, u, s, department, of, health, and, human, services, this, disorder, can, be, distinguished, by, unexpected, and, repeated, episodes, of, intense, fear, someone, with, panic, disorder, will, eventually, develop, constant, fear, of, another, attack, and, as, this, progresses, it, will, begin, to, affect, daily, functioning, and, an, individual, s, general, quality, of, life, it, is, reported, by, the, cleveland, clinic, that, panic, disorder, affects, 2, to, 3, percent, of, adult, americans, and, can, begin, around, the, time, of, the, teenage, and, early, adult, years, some, symptoms, include, difficulty, breathing, chest, pain, dizziness, trembling, or, shaking, feeling, faint, nausea, fear, that, you, are, losing, control, or, are, about, to, die, even, though, they, have, these, symptoms, during, an, attack, the, main, symptom, is, the, persistent, fear, of, having, future, panic, attacks, anxiety, disorders, are, a, group, of, mental, disorders, characterized, by, exaggerated, feelings, of, anxiety, and, fear, responses, anxiety, is, a, worry, about, future, events, and, fear, is, a, reaction, to, current, events, these, feelings, may, cause, physical, symptoms, such, as, a, fast, heart, rate, and, shakiness, there, are, a, number, of, anxiety, disorders, including, generalized, anxiety, disorder, specific, phobia, social, anxiety, disorder, separation, anxiety, disorder, agoraphobia, panic, disorder, and, selective, mutism, the, disorder, differs, by, what, results, in, the, symptoms, people, often, have, more, than, one, anxiety, disorder, anxiety, disorders, are, caused, by, a, complex, combination, of, genetic, and, environmental, factors, to, be, diagnosed, symptoms, typically, need, to, be, present, for, at, least, six, months, be, more, than, would, be, expected, for, the, situation, and, decrease, a, person, s, ability, to, function, in, their, daily, lives, other, problems, that, may, result, in, similar, symptoms, include, hyperthyroidism, heart, disease, caffeine, alcohol, or, cannabis, use, and, withdrawal, from, certain, drugs, among, others, without, treatment, anxiety, disorders, tend, to, remain, treatment, may, include, lifestyle, changes, counselling, and, medications, counselling, is, typically, with, a, type, of, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, medications, such, as, antidepressants, or, beta, blockers, may, improve, symptoms, a, 2023, review, found, that, regular, physical, activity, is, effective, for, reducing, anxiety, about, 12, of, people, are, affected, by, an, anxiety, disorder, in, a, given, year, and, between, 12, and, 30, are, affected, at, some, point, in, their, life, they, occur, about, twice, as, often, in, women, than, they, do, in, men, and, generally, begin, before, the, age, of, 25, the, most, common, anxiety, disorders, are, specific, phobias, which, affect, nearly, 12, of, people, and, social, anxiety, disorder, which, affects, 10, of, people, at, some, point, in, their, life, they, affect, those, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 35, the, most, and, become, less, common, after, the, age, of, 55, rates, appear, to, be, higher, in, the, united, states, and, europe, anxiety, can, be, either, a, short, term, state, or, a, long, term, trait, whereas, trait, anxiety, represents, worrying, about, future, events, anxiety, disorders, are, a, group, of, mental, disorders, characterized, by, feelings, of, anxiety, and, fears, in, his, book, anxious, the, modern, mind, in, the, age, of, anxiety, joseph, ledoux, examines, four, experiences, of, anxiety, through, a, brain, based, lens, anxiety, disorders, often, occur, with, other, mental, health, disorders, particularly, major, depressive, disorder, bipolar, disorder, eating, disorders, or, certain, personality, disorders, it, also, commonly, occurs, with, personality, traits, such, as, neuroticism, this, observed, co, occurrence, is, partly, due, to, genetic, and, environmental, influences, shared, between, these, traits, and, anxiety, it, is, common, for, those, with, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, to, experience, anxiety, anxiety, is, also, commonly, found, in, those, who, experience, panic, disorders, phobic, anxiety, disorders, severe, stress, dissociative, disorders, somatoform, disorders, and, some, neurotic, disorders, anxiety, has, also, been, linked, to, the, experience, of, intrusive, thoughts, studies, have, revealed, that, individuals, who, experience, high, levels, of, anxiety, also, known, as, clinical, anxiety, are, highly, vulnerable, to, the, experience, of, intense, intrusive, thoughts, or, psychological, disorders, that, are, characterised, by, intrusive, thoughts, anxiety, disorders, are, partly, genetic, with, twin, studies, suggesting, 30, 40, genetic, influence, on, individual, differences, in, anxiety, environmental, factors, are, also, important, twin, studies, show, that, individual, specific, environments, have, a, large, influence, on, anxiety, whereas, shared, environmental, influences, environments, that, affect, twins, in, the, same, way, operate, during, childhood, but, decline, through, adolescence, specific, measured, environments, that, have, been, associated, with, anxiety, include, child, abuse, family, history, of, mental, health, disorders, and, poverty, anxiety, is, also, associated, with, drug, use, including, alcohol, caffeine, and, benzodiazepines, which, are, often, prescribed, to, treat, anxiety, neural, circuitry, involving, the, amygdala, which, regulates, emotions, like, anxiety, and, fear, stimulating, the, hpa, axis, and, sympathetic, nervous, system, and, hippocampus, which, is, implicated, in, emotional, memory, along, with, the, amygdala, is, thought, to, underlie, anxiety, people, who, have, anxiety, tend, to, show, high, activity, in, response, to, emotional, stimuli, in, the, amygdala, some, writers, believe, that, excessive, anxiety, can, lead, to, an, overpotentiation, of, the, limbic, system, which, includes, the, amygdala, and, nucleus, accumbens, giving, increased, future, anxiety, but, this, does, not, appear, to, have, been, proven, research, upon, adolescents, who, as, infants, had, been, highly, apprehensive, vigilant, and, fearful, finds, that, their, nucleus, accumbens, is, more, sensitive, than, that, in, other, people, when, deciding, to, make, an, action, that, determined, whether, they, received, a, reward, this, suggests, a, link, between, circuits, responsible, for, fear, and, also, reward, in, anxious, people, as, researchers, note, a, sense, of, responsibility, or, self, agency, in, a, context, of, uncertainty, probabilistic, outcomes, drives, the, neural, system, underlying, appetitive, motivation, i, e, nucleus, accumbens, more, strongly, in, temperamentally, inhibited, than, noninhibited, adolescents, the, microbes, of, the, gut, can, connect, with, the, brain, to, affect, anxiety, there, are, various, pathways, along, which, this, communication, can, take, place, one, is, through, the, major, neurotransmitters, the, gut, microbes, such, as, bifidobacterium, and, bacillus, produce, the, neurotransmitters, gaba, and, dopamine, respectively, the, neurotransmitters, signal, to, the, nervous, system, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, those, signals, will, be, carried, to, the, brain, through, the, vagus, nerve, or, the, spinal, system, this, is, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, altering, the, microbiome, has, shown, anxiety, and, depression, reducing, effects, in, mice, but, not, in, subjects, without, vagus, nerves, another, key, pathway, is, the, hpa, axis, as, mentioned, above, the, microbes, can, control, the, levels, of, cytokines, in, the, body, and, altering, cytokine, levels, creates, direct, effects, on, areas, of, the, brain, such, as, the, hypothalamus, the, area, that, triggers, hpa, axis, activity, the, hpa, axis, regulates, production, of, cortisol, a, hormone, that, takes, part, in, the, body, s, stress, response, when, hpa, activity, spikes, cortisol, levels, increase, processing, and, reducing, anxiety, in, stressful, situations, these, pathways, as, well, as, the, specific, effects, of, individual, taxa, of, microbes, are, not, yet, completely, clear, but, the, communication, between, the, gut, microbiome, and, the, brain, is, undeniable, as, is, the, ability, of, these, pathways, to, alter, anxiety, levels, with, this, communication, comes, the, potential, to, treat, prebiotics, and, probiotics, have, been, shown, to, reduce, anxiety, for, example, experiments, in, which, mice, were, given, fructo, and, galacto, oligosaccharide, prebiotics, and, lactobacillus, probiotics, have, both, demonstrated, a, capability, to, reduce, anxiety, in, humans, results, are, not, as, concrete, but, promising, genetics, and, family, history, e, g, parental, anxiety, may, put, an, individual, at, increased, risk, of, an, anxiety, disorder, but, generally, external, stimuli, will, trigger, its, onset, or, exacerbation, estimates, of, genetic, influence, on, anxiety, based, on, studies, of, twins, range, from, 25, to, 40, depending, on, the, specific, type, and, age, group, under, study, for, example, genetic, differences, account, for, about, 43, of, variance, in, panic, disorder, and, 28, in, generalized, anxiety, disorder, longitudinal, twin, studies, have, shown, the, moderate, stability, of, anxiety, from, childhood, through, to, adulthood, is, mainly, influenced, by, stability, in, genetic, influence, when, investigating, how, anxiety, is, passed, on, from, parents, to, children, it, is, important, to, account, for, sharing, of, genes, as, well, as, environments, for, example, using, the, intergenerational, children, of, twins, design, many, studies, in, the, past, used, a, candidate, gene, approach, to, test, whether, single, genes, were, associated, with, anxiety, these, investigations, were, based, on, hypotheses, about, how, certain, known, genes, influence, neurotransmitters, such, as, serotonin, and, norepinephrine, and, hormones, such, as, cortisol, that, are, implicated, in, anxiety, none, of, these, findings, are, well, replicated, with, the, possible, exception, of, tmem132d, comt, and, mao, a, the, epigenetic, signature, of, bdnf, a, gene, that, codes, for, a, protein, called, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factor, that, is, found, in, the, brain, has, also, been, associated, with, anxiety, and, specific, patterns, of, neural, activity, and, a, receptor, gene, for, bdnf, called, ntrk2, was, associated, with, anxiety, in, a, large, genome, wide, investigation, the, reason, that, most, candidate, gene, findings, have, not, replicated, is, that, anxiety, is, a, complex, trait, that, is, influenced, by, many, genomic, variants, each, of, which, has, a, small, effect, on, its, own, increasingly, studies, of, anxiety, are, using, a, hypothesis, free, approach, to, look, for, parts, of, the, genome, that, are, implicated, in, anxiety, using, big, enough, samples, to, find, associations, with, variants, that, have, small, effects, the, largest, explorations, of, the, common, genetic, architecture, of, anxiety, have, been, facilitated, by, the, uk, biobank, the, angst, consortium, and, the, crc, fear, anxiety, and, anxiety, disorders, archived, 2019, 04, 29, at, the, wayback, machine, epigenetics, of, anxiety, and, stress, related, disorders, is, the, field, studying, the, relationship, between, epigenetic, modifications, of, genes, and, anxiety, and, stress, related, disorders, including, mental, health, disorders, such, as, generalized, anxiety, disorder, gad, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, and, more, these, changes, can, lead, to, transgenerational, stress, inheritance, epigenetic, modifications, play, a, role, in, the, development, and, heritability, of, these, disorders, and, related, symptoms, for, example, regulation, of, the, hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal, axis, by, glucocorticoids, plays, a, major, role, in, stress, response, and, is, known, to, be, epigenetically, regulated, many, medical, conditions, can, cause, anxiety, this, includes, conditions, that, affect, the, ability, to, breathe, like, copd, and, asthma, and, the, difficulty, in, breathing, that, often, occurs, near, death, conditions, that, cause, abdominal, pain, or, chest, pain, can, cause, anxiety, and, may, in, some, cases, be, a, somatization, of, anxiety, the, same, is, true, for, some, sexual, dysfunctions, conditions, that, affect, the, face, or, the, skin, can, cause, social, anxiety, especially, among, adolescents, and, developmental, disabilities, often, lead, to, social, anxiety, for, children, as, well, life, threatening, conditions, like, cancer, also, cause, anxiety, furthermore, certain, organic, diseases, may, present, with, anxiety, or, symptoms, that, mimic, anxiety, these, disorders, include, certain, endocrine, diseases, hypo, and, hyperthyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, metabolic, disorders, diabetes, deficiency, states, low, levels, of, vitamin, d, b2, b12, folic, acid, gastrointestinal, diseases, celiac, disease, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, inflammatory, bowel, disease, heart, diseases, blood, diseases, anemia, cerebral, vascular, accidents, transient, ischemic, attack, stroke, and, brain, degenerative, diseases, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, multiple, sclerosis, huntington, s, disease, among, others, several, drugs, can, cause, or, worsen, anxiety, whether, in, intoxication, withdrawal, or, as, side, effect, these, include, alcohol, tobacco, sedatives, including, prescription, benzodiazepines, opioids, including, prescription, pain, killers, and, illicit, drugs, like, heroin, stimulants, such, as, caffeine, cocaine, and, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and, inhalants, while, many, often, report, self, medicating, anxiety, with, these, substances, improvements, in, anxiety, from, drugs, are, usually, short, lived, with, worsening, of, anxiety, in, the, long, term, sometimes, with, acute, anxiety, as, soon, as, the, drug, effects, wear, off, and, tend, to, be, exaggerated, acute, exposure, to, toxic, levels, of, benzene, may, cause, euphoria, anxiety, and, irritability, lasting, up, to, 2, weeks, after, the, exposure, poor, coping, skills, e, g, rigidity, inflexible, problem, solving, denial, avoidance, impulsivity, extreme, self, expectation, negative, thoughts, affective, instability, and, inability, to, focus, on, problems, are, associated, with, anxiety, anxiety, is, also, linked, and, perpetuated, by, the, person, s, own, pessimistic, outcome, expectancy, and, how, they, cope, with, feedback, negativity, temperament, e, g, neuroticism, and, attitudes, e, g, pessimism, have, been, found, to, be, risk, factors, for, anxiety, cognitive, distortions, such, as, overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, mind, reading, emotional, reasoning, binocular, trick, and, mental, filter, can, result, in, anxiety, for, example, an, overgeneralized, belief, that, something, bad, always, happens, may, lead, someone, to, have, excessive, fears, of, even, minimally, risky, situations, and, to, avoid, benign, social, situations, due, to, anticipatory, anxiety, of, embarrassment, in, addition, those, who, have, high, anxiety, can, also, create, future, stressful, life, events, together, these, findings, suggest, that, anxious, thoughts, can, lead, to, anticipatory, anxiety, as, well, as, stressful, events, which, in, turn, cause, more, anxiety, such, unhealthy, thoughts, can, be, targets, for, successful, treatment, with, cognitive, therapy, psychodynamic, theory, posits, that, anxiety, is, often, the, result, of, opposing, unconscious, wishes, or, fears, that, manifest, via, maladaptive, defense, mechanisms, such, as, suppression, repression, anticipation, regression, somatization, passive, aggression, dissociation, that, develop, to, adapt, to, problems, with, early, objects, e, g, caregivers, and, empathic, failures, in, childhood, for, example, persistent, parental, discouragement, of, anger, may, result, in, repression, suppression, of, angry, feelings, which, manifests, as, gastrointestinal, distress, somatization, when, provoked, by, another, while, the, anger, remains, unconscious, and, outside, the, individual, s, awareness, such, conflicts, can, be, targets, for, successful, treatment, with, psychodynamic, therapy, while, psychodynamic, therapy, tends, to, explore, the, underlying, roots, of, anxiety, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, has, also, been, shown, to, be, a, successful, treatment, for, anxiety, by, altering, irrational, thoughts, and, unwanted, behaviors, an, evolutionary, psychology, explanation, is, that, increased, anxiety, serves, the, purpose, of, increased, vigilance, regarding, potential, threats, in, the, environment, as, well, as, increased, tendency, to, take, proactive, actions, regarding, such, possible, threats, this, may, cause, false, positive, reactions, but, an, individual, with, anxiety, may, also, avoid, real, threats, this, may, explain, why, anxious, people, are, less, likely, to, die, due, to, accidents, there, is, ample, empirical, evidence, that, anxiety, can, have, adaptive, value, within, a, school, timid, fish, are, more, likely, than, bold, fish, to, survive, a, predator, when, people, are, confronted, with, unpleasant, and, potentially, harmful, stimuli, such, as, foul, odors, or, tastes, pet, scans, show, increased, blood, flow, in, the, amygdala, in, these, studies, the, participants, also, reported, moderate, anxiety, this, might, indicate, that, anxiety, is, a, protective, mechanism, designed, to, prevent, the, organism, from, engaging, in, potentially, harmful, behaviors, social, risk, factors, for, anxiety, include, a, history, of, trauma, e, g, physical, sexual, or, emotional, abuse, or, assault, bullying, early, life, experiences, and, parenting, factors, e, g, rejection, lack, of, warmth, high, hostility, harsh, discipline, high, parental, negative, affect, anxious, childrearing, modelling, of, dysfunctional, and, drug, abusing, behaviour, discouragement, of, emotions, poor, socialization, poor, attachment, and, child, abuse, and, neglect, cultural, factors, e, g, stoic, families, cultures, persecuted, minorities, including, those, with, disabilities, and, socioeconomics, e, g, uneducated, unemployed, impoverished, although, developed, countries, have, higher, rates, of, anxiety, disorders, than, developing, countries, a, 2019, comprehensive, systematic, review, of, over, 50, studies, showed, that, food, insecurity, in, the, united, states, is, strongly, associated, with, depression, anxiety, and, sleep, disorders, food, insecure, individuals, had, an, almost, 3, fold, risk, increase, of, testing, positive, for, anxiety, when, compared, to, food, secure, individuals, contextual, factors, that, are, thought, to, contribute, to, anxiety, include, gender, socialization, and, learning, experiences, in, particular, learning, mastery, the, degree, to, which, people, perceive, their, lives, to, be, under, their, own, control, and, instrumentality, which, includes, such, traits, as, self, confidence, self, efficacy, independence, and, competitiveness, fully, mediate, the, relation, between, gender, and, anxiety, that, is, though, gender, differences, in, anxiety, exist, with, higher, levels, of, anxiety, in, women, compared, to, men, gender, socialization, and, learning, mastery, explain, these, gender, differences, the, first, step, in, the, management, of, a, person, with, anxiety, symptoms, involves, evaluating, the, possible, presence, of, an, underlying, medical, cause, the, recognition, of, which, is, essential, in, order, to, decide, the, correct, treatment, anxiety, symptoms, may, mask, an, organic, disease, or, appear, associated, with, or, as, a, result, of, a, medical, disorder, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, is, effective, for, anxiety, disorders, and, is, a, first, line, treatment, cbt, appears, to, be, equally, effective, when, carried, out, via, the, internet, while, evidence, for, mental, health, apps, is, promising, it, is, preliminary, anxiety, often, affects, relationships, and, interpersonal, psychotherapy, addresses, these, issues, by, improving, communication, and, relationship, skills, psychopharmacological, treatment, can, be, used, in, parallel, to, cbt, or, can, be, used, alone, as, a, general, rule, most, anxiety, disorders, respond, well, to, first, line, agents, such, drugs, also, used, as, anti, depressants, are, the, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, and, serotonin, norepinephrine, reuptake, inhibitors, that, work, by, blocking, the, reuptake, of, specific, neurotransmitters, and, resulting, in, the, increase, in, availability, of, these, neurotransmitters, additionally, benzodiazepines, are, often, prescribed, to, individuals, with, anxiety, disorder, benzodiazepines, produce, an, anxiolytic, response, by, modulating, gaba, and, increasing, its, receptor, binding, a, third, common, treatment, involves, a, category, of, drug, known, as, serotonin, agonists, this, category, of, drug, works, by, initiating, a, physiological, response, at, 5, ht1a, receptor, by, increasing, the, action, of, serotonin, at, this, receptor, other, treatment, options, include, pregabalin, tricyclic, antidepressants, and, moclobemide, among, others, anxiety, is, considered, to, be, a, serious, psychiatric, illness, that, has, an, unknown, true, pervasiveness, due, to, affected, individuals, not, asking, for, proper, treatment, or, aid, and, due, to, professionals, missing, the, diagnosis, the, above, risk, factors, give, natural, avenues, for, prevention, a, 2017, review, found, that, psychological, or, educational, interventions, have, a, small, yet, statistically, significant, benefit, for, the, prevention, of, anxiety, in, varied, population, types, anxiety, disorder, appears, to, be, a, genetically, inherited, neurochemical, dysfunction, that, may, involve, autonomic, imbalance, decreased, gaba, ergic, tone, allelic, polymorphism, of, the, catechol, o, methyltransferase, comt, gene, increased, adenosine, receptor, function, increased, cortisol, in, the, central, nervous, system, cns, the, major, mediators, of, the, symptoms, of, anxiety, disorders, appear, to, be, norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and, gamma, aminobutyric, acid, gaba, other, neurotransmitters, and, peptides, such, as, corticotropin, releasing, factor, may, be, involved, peripherally, the, autonomic, nervous, system, especially, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, mediates, many, of, the, symptoms, increased, flow, in, the, right, parahippocampal, region, and, reduced, serotonin, type, 1a, receptor, binding, in, the, anterior, and, posterior, cingulate, and, raphe, of, patients, are, the, diagnostic, factors, for, prevalence, of, anxiety, disorder, the, amygdala, is, central, to, the, processing, of, fear, and, anxiety, and, its, function, may, be, disrupted, in, anxiety, disorders, anxiety, processing, in, the, basolateral, amygdala, has, been, implicated, with, expansion, of, dendritic, arborization, of, the, amygdaloid, neurons, sk2, potassium, channels, mediate, inhibitory, influence, on, action, potentials, and, reduce, arborization
