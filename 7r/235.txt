https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_peoples
the, austronesian, peoples, sometimes, referred, to, as, austronesian, speaking, peoples, are, a, large, group, of, peoples, in, taiwan, maritime, southeast, asia, parts, of, mainland, southeast, asia, micronesia, coastal, new, guinea, island, melanesia, polynesia, and, madagascar, that, speak, austronesian, languages, they, also, include, indigenous, ethnic, minorities, in, vietnam, cambodia, myanmar, thailand, hainan, the, comoros, and, the, torres, strait, islands, the, nations, and, territories, predominantly, populated, by, austronesian, speaking, peoples, are, sometimes, known, collectively, as, austronesia, they, originated, from, a, prehistoric, seaborne, migration, known, as, the, austronesian, expansion, from, taiwan, circa, 3000, to, 1500, bce, austronesians, reached, the, northernmost, philippines, specifically, the, batanes, islands, by, around, 2200, bce, they, used, sails, some, time, before, 2000, bce, 144, in, conjunction, with, their, use, of, other, maritime, technologies, notably, catamarans, outrigger, boats, lashed, lug, boats, and, the, crab, claw, sail, this, enabled, their, rapid, dispersal, into, the, islands, of, the, indo, pacific, culminating, in, the, settlement, of, new, zealand, c, 1250, ce, during, the, initial, part, of, the, migrations, they, encountered, and, assimilated, or, were, assimilated, by, the, paleolithic, populations, that, had, migrated, earlier, into, maritime, southeast, asia, and, new, guinea, they, reached, as, far, as, easter, island, to, the, east, madagascar, to, the, west, and, new, zealand, to, the, south, at, the, furthest, extent, they, might, have, also, reached, the, americas, aside, from, language, austronesian, peoples, widely, share, cultural, characteristics, including, such, traditions, and, traditional, technologies, as, tattooing, stilt, houses, jade, carving, wetland, agriculture, and, various, rock, art, motifs, they, also, share, domesticated, plants, and, animals, that, were, carried, along, with, the, migrations, including, rice, bananas, coconuts, breadfruit, dioscorea, yams, taro, paper, mulberry, chickens, pigs, and, dogs, the, linguistic, connections, between, madagascar, polynesia, and, southeast, asia, particularly, the, similarities, between, malagasy, malay, and, polynesian, numerals, were, recognized, early, in, the, colonial, era, by, european, authors, the, first, formal, publication, on, these, relationships, was, in, 1708, by, dutch, orientalist, adriaan, reland, who, recognized, a, common, language, from, madagascar, to, western, polynesia, although, dutch, explorer, cornelis, de, houtman, observed, linguistic, links, between, madagascar, and, the, malay, archipelago, a, century, earlier, in, 1603, german, naturalist, johann, reinhold, forster, who, traveled, with, james, cook, on, his, second, voyage, also, recognized, the, similarities, of, polynesian, languages, to, those, of, island, southeast, asia, in, his, book, observations, made, during, a, voyage, round, the, world, 1778, he, posited, that, the, ultimate, origins, of, the, polynesians, might, have, been, the, lowland, regions, of, the, philippines, and, proposed, that, they, arrived, to, the, islands, via, long, distance, voyaging, the, spanish, philologist, lorenzo, herv, s, later, devoted, a, large, part, of, his, idea, dell, universo, 1778, 1787, to, the, establishment, of, a, language, family, linking, the, malay, peninsula, the, maldives, madagascar, indonesia, sunda, islands, and, moluccas, the, philippines, and, the, pacific, islands, eastward, to, easter, island, multiple, other, authors, corroborated, this, classification, except, for, the, erroneous, inclusion, of, maldivian, and, the, language, family, came, to, be, known, as, malayo, polynesian, first, coined, by, the, german, linguist, franz, bopp, in, 1841, german, malayisch, polynesisch, the, connections, between, southeast, asia, madagascar, and, the, pacific, islands, were, also, noted, by, other, european, explorers, including, the, orientalist, william, marsden, and, the, naturalist, johann, reinhold, forster, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, added, austronesians, as, the, fifth, category, to, his, varieties, of, humans, in, the, second, edition, of, de, generis, humani, varietate, nativa, 1781, he, initially, grouped, them, by, geography, and, thus, called, austronesians, the, people, from, the, southern, world, in, the, third, edition, published, in, 1795, he, named, austronesians, the, malay, race, or, the, brown, race, after, correspondence, with, joseph, banks, who, was, part, of, the, first, voyage, of, james, cook, blumenbach, used, the, term, malay, due, to, his, belief, that, most, austronesians, spoke, the, malay, idiom, i, e, the, austronesian, languages, though, he, inadvertently, caused, the, later, confusion, of, his, racial, category, with, the, malay, ethnic, group, the, other, varieties, blumenbach, identified, were, the, caucasians, white, mongolians, yellow, ethiopians, black, and, americans, red, blumenbach, s, definition, of, the, malay, race, is, largely, identical, to, the, modern, distribution, of, the, austronesian, peoples, including, not, only, islander, southeast, asians, but, also, the, people, of, madagascar, and, the, pacific, islands, although, blumenbach, s, work, was, later, used, in, scientific, racism, blumenbach, was, a, monogenist, and, did, not, believe, the, human, varieties, were, inherently, inferior, to, each, other, rather, he, believed, that, the, malay, race, was, a, combination, of, the, ethiopian, and, caucasian, varieties, malay, variety, tawny, coloured, hair, black, soft, curly, thick, and, plentiful, head, moderately, narrowed, forehead, slightly, swelling, nose, full, rather, wide, as, it, were, diffuse, end, thick, mouth, large, upper, jaw, somewhat, prominent, with, parts, of, the, face, when, seen, in, profile, sufficiently, prominent, and, distinct, from, each, other, this, last, variety, includes, the, islanders, of, the, pacific, ocean, together, with, the, inhabitants, of, the, marianas, the, philippine, the, molucca, and, the, sunda, islands, and, of, the, malayan, peninsula, i, wish, to, call, it, the, malay, because, the, majority, of, the, men, of, this, variety, especially, those, who, inhabit, the, indian, islands, close, to, the, malacca, peninsula, as, well, as, the, sandwich, the, society, and, the, friendly, islanders, and, also, the, malambi, of, madagascar, down, to, the, inhabitants, of, easter, island, use, the, malay, idiom, by, the, 19th, century, however, a, classification, of, austronesians, as, being, a, subset, of, the, mongolian, race, was, favoured, as, was, polygenism, the, australo, melanesian, populations, of, southeast, asia, and, melanesia, whom, blumenbach, initially, classified, as, a, subrace, of, the, malay, race, were, also, now, being, treated, as, a, separate, ethiopian, race, by, authors, like, georges, cuvier, conrad, malte, brun, who, first, coined, the, term, oceania, as, oc, anique, julien, joseph, virey, and, ren, lesson, the, british, naturalist, james, cowles, prichard, originally, followed, blumenbach, by, treating, papuans, and, indigenous, australians, as, being, descendants, of, the, same, stock, as, austronesians, but, by, his, third, edition, of, researches, into, the, physical, history, of, man, 1836, 1847, his, work, had, become, more, racialized, due, to, the, influence, of, polygenism, he, classified, the, peoples, of, austronesia, into, two, groups, the, malayo, polynesians, roughly, equivalent, to, the, austronesian, peoples, and, the, kel, nonesians, roughly, equivalent, to, the, australo, melanesians, he, further, subdivided, the, latter, into, the, alfourous, also, haraforas, or, alfo, rs, the, native, australians, and, the, pelagian, or, oceanic, negroes, the, melanesians, and, western, polynesians, despite, this, he, acknowledges, that, malayo, polynesians, and, pelagian, negroes, had, remarkable, characters, in, common, particularly, in, terms, of, language, and, craniometry, in, linguistics, the, malayo, polynesian, language, family, also, initially, excluded, melanesia, and, micronesia, due, to, the, perceived, physical, differences, between, the, inhabitants, of, these, regions, from, malayo, polynesian, speakers, however, there, was, growing, evidence, of, their, linguistic, relationship, to, malayo, polynesian, languages, notably, from, studies, on, the, melanesian, languages, by, georg, von, der, gabelentz, robert, henry, codrington, and, sidney, herbert, ray, codrington, coined, and, used, the, term, ocean, language, family, rather, than, malayo, polynesian, in, 1891, in, opposition, to, the, exclusion, of, melanesian, and, micronesian, languages, this, was, adopted, by, ray, who, defined, the, oceanic, language, family, as, encompassing, the, languages, of, southeast, asia, and, madagascar, micronesia, melanesia, and, polynesia, in, 1899, the, austrian, linguist, and, ethnologist, wilhelm, schmidt, coined, the, term, austronesian, german, austronesisch, from, latin, auster, south, wind, and, greek, island, to, refer, to, the, language, family, schmidt, had, the, same, motivations, as, codrington, he, proposed, the, term, as, a, replacement, to, malayo, polynesian, because, he, also, opposed, the, implied, exclusion, of, the, languages, of, melanesia, and, micronesia, in, the, latter, name, it, became, the, accepted, name, for, the, language, family, with, oceanic, and, malayo, polynesian, languages, being, retained, as, names, for, subgroups, the, term, austronesian, or, more, accurately, austronesian, speaking, peoples, came, to, refer, to, people, who, speak, the, languages, of, the, austronesian, language, family, some, authors, however, object, to, the, use, of, the, term, to, refer, to, people, as, they, question, whether, there, really, is, any, biological, or, cultural, shared, ancestry, between, all, austronesian, speaking, groups, this, is, especially, true, for, authors, who, reject, the, prevailing, out, of, taiwan, hypothesis, and, instead, offer, scenarios, where, the, austronesian, languages, spread, among, preexisting, static, populations, through, borrowing, or, convergence, with, little, or, no, population, movements, despite, these, objections, the, general, consensus, is, that, the, archeological, cultural, genetic, and, especially, linguistic, evidence, all, separately, indicate, varying, degrees, of, shared, ancestry, among, austronesian, speaking, peoples, that, justifies, their, treatment, as, a, phylogenetic, unit, this, has, led, to, the, use, of, the, term, austronesian, in, academic, literature, to, refer, not, only, to, the, austronesian, languages, but, also, the, austronesian, speaking, peoples, their, societies, and, the, geographic, area, of, austronesia, some, austronesian, speaking, groups, are, not, direct, descendants, of, austronesians, and, acquired, their, languages, through, language, shift, but, this, is, believed, to, have, happened, only, in, a, few, instances, since, the, austronesian, expansion, was, too, rapid, for, language, shifts, to, have, occurred, fast, enough, in, parts, of, island, melanesia, migrations, and, paternal, admixture, from, papuan, groups, after, the, austronesian, expansion, estimated, to, have, started, at, around, 500, bce, also, resulted, in, gradual, population, turnover, these, secondary, migrations, were, incremental, and, happened, gradually, enough, that, the, culture, and, language, of, these, groups, remained, austronesian, even, though, in, modern, times, they, are, genetically, more, papuan, in, the, vast, majority, of, cases, the, language, and, material, culture, of, austronesian, speaking, groups, descend, directly, through, generational, continuity, especially, in, islands, that, were, previously, uninhabited, serious, research, into, the, austronesian, languages, and, its, speakers, has, been, ongoing, since, the, 19th, century, modern, scholarship, on, austronesian, dispersion, models, is, generally, credited, to, two, influential, papers, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, colonisation, of, the, pacific, a, genetic, trail, hill, serjeantson, eds, 1989, and, the, austronesian, dispersal, and, the, origin, of, languages, bellwood, 1991, the, topic, is, particularly, interesting, to, scientists, for, the, remarkably, unique, characteristics, of, the, austronesian, speakers, their, extent, diversity, and, rapid, dispersal, regardless, certain, disagreements, still, exist, among, researchers, with, regards, to, chronology, origin, dispersal, adaptations, to, the, island, environments, interactions, with, preexisting, populations, in, areas, they, settled, and, cultural, developments, over, time, the, mainstream, accepted, hypothesis, is, the, out, of, taiwan, model, first, proposed, by, peter, bellwood, but, there, are, multiple, rival, models, that, create, a, sort, of, pseudo, competition, among, their, supporters, due, to, narrow, focus, on, data, from, limited, geographic, areas, or, disciplines, the, most, notable, of, which, is, the, out, of, sundaland, or, out, of, island, southeast, asia, model, austronesians, were, the, first, humans, with, seafaring, vessels, that, could, cross, large, distances, on, the, open, ocean, this, technology, allowed, them, to, colonize, a, large, part, of, the, indo, pacific, region, prior, to, the, 16th, century, colonial, era, the, austronesian, language, family, was, the, most, widespread, in, the, world, spanning, half, the, planet, from, easter, island, in, the, eastern, pacific, ocean, to, madagascar, in, the, western, indian, ocean, languages, of, the, austronesian, family, are, today, spoken, by, about, 386, million, people, 4, 9, of, the, global, population, making, it, the, fifth, largest, language, family, by, number, of, speakers, major, austronesian, languages, include, malay, around, 250, 270, million, in, indonesia, alone, in, its, own, literary, standard, named, indonesian, javanese, and, filipino, tagalog, the, family, contains, 1, 257, languages, the, second, largest, number, of, any, language, family, the, geographic, region, that, encompasses, native, austronesian, speaking, populations, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, austronesia, other, geographic, names, for, various, subregions, include, malay, peninsula, greater, sunda, islands, lesser, sunda, islands, island, melanesia, island, southeast, asia, malay, archipelago, maritime, southeast, asia, melanesia, micronesia, near, oceania, oceania, pacific, islands, remote, oceania, polynesia, and, wallacea, in, indonesia, the, nationalistic, term, nusantara, from, old, javanese, is, also, popularly, used, for, the, indonesian, islands, austronesian, regions, are, almost, exclusively, islands, in, the, pacific, and, indian, oceans, with, predominantly, tropical, or, subtropical, climates, with, considerable, seasonal, rainfall, inhabitants, of, these, regions, include, taiwanese, indigenous, peoples, most, ethnic, groups, in, brunei, east, timor, indonesia, madagascar, malaysia, micronesia, the, philippines, and, polynesia, also, included, are, the, malays, of, singapore, the, polynesians, of, new, zealand, hawaii, and, chile, the, torres, strait, islanders, of, australia, the, non, papuan, peoples, of, melanesia, and, coastal, new, guinea, the, shibushi, speakers, of, the, comoros, and, the, malagasy, and, shibushi, speakers, of, r, union, austronesians, are, also, found, in, the, regions, of, southern, thailand, the, cham, areas, in, vietnam, cambodia, and, hainan, and, the, mergui, archipelago, of, myanmar, additionally, modern, era, migration, has, brought, austronesian, speaking, people, to, the, united, states, canada, australia, the, uk, mainland, europe, cocos, keeling, islands, south, africa, sri, lanka, suriname, hong, kong, macau, and, west, asian, countries, some, authors, also, propose, further, settlements, and, contacts, in, the, past, in, areas, that, are, not, inhabited, by, austronesian, speakers, today, these, range, from, likely, hypotheses, to, very, controversial, claims, with, minimal, evidence, in, 2009, roger, blench, compiled, an, expanded, map, of, austronesia, that, encompassed, these, claims, based, on, a, variety, of, evidence, such, as, historical, accounts, loanwords, introduced, plants, and, animals, genetics, archeological, sites, and, material, culture, they, include, areas, like, the, pacific, coast, of, the, americas, japan, the, yaeyama, islands, the, australian, coast, sri, lanka, and, coastal, south, asia, the, persian, gulf, some, indian, ocean, islands, east, africa, south, africa, and, west, africa, austronesian, peoples, include, the, following, groupings, by, name, and, geographic, location, incomplete, the, broad, consensus, on, austronesian, origins, is, the, two, layer, model, where, an, original, paleolithic, indigenous, population, in, island, southeast, asia, were, assimilated, to, varying, degrees, by, incoming, migrations, of, neolithic, austronesian, speaking, peoples, from, taiwan, and, fujian, in, southern, china, from, around, 4, 000, bp, austronesians, also, mixed, with, other, preexisting, populations, as, well, as, later, migrant, populations, among, the, islands, they, settled, resulting, in, further, genetic, input, the, most, notable, are, the, austroasiatic, speaking, peoples, in, western, island, southeast, asia, peninsular, malaysia, sumatra, borneo, and, java, the, bantu, peoples, in, madagascar, and, the, comoros, as, well, as, japanese, persian, indian, arab, and, han, chinese, traders, and, migrants, in, more, recent, centuries, island, southeast, asia, was, settled, by, modern, humans, in, the, paleolithic, following, coastal, migration, routes, presumably, starting, before, 70, 000, bp, from, africa, long, before, the, development, of, austronesian, cultures, these, populations, are, typified, by, having, dark, skin, curly, hair, and, short, statures, leading, europeans, to, believe, in, the, 19th, century, that, they, were, related, to, african, pygmies, however, despite, these, physical, similarities, genetic, studies, have, shown, that, they, are, more, closely, related, to, other, eurasian, populations, than, to, africans, the, lowered, sea, levels, of, the, pleistocene, made, some, of, the, modern, day, islands, of, sundaland, accessible, via, land, bridges, however, the, spread, of, humans, across, the, wallace, line, and, into, sahul, necessitated, crossing, bodies, of, water, remains, of, stone, tools, and, marine, shells, in, liang, sarru, salibabu, island, north, sulawesi, dated, to, 32, 000, 35, 000, years, ago, is, possible, evidence, for, the, longest, sea, voyage, by, paleolithic, humans, ever, recorded, the, island, was, previously, uninhabited, by, humans, or, hominins, and, can, only, be, reached, from, either, mindanao, or, the, sangihe, islands, by, crossing, an, expanse, of, water, at, least, 100, km, 62, mi, wide, even, during, the, low, sea, levels, of, the, pleistocene, other, evidence, of, early, maritime, transport, are, the, appearance, of, obsidian, tools, with, the, same, source, on, neighboring, islands, these, include, the, philippine, obsidian, network, mindoro, and, palawan, ca, 33, 000, 28, 000, bp, and, the, wallacea, obsidian, network, timor, atauro, kisar, alor, ca, 22, 000, bp, however, the, method, of, crossing, remains, unknown, and, could, have, ranged, from, simple, rafts, to, dugout, canoes, by, the, terminal, pleistocene, these, early, settlers, are, generally, historically, referred, to, as, australo, melanesians, though, the, terminology, is, problematic, as, they, are, genetically, diverse, and, most, groups, within, austronesia, have, significant, austronesian, admixture, and, culture, the, unmixed, descendants, of, these, groups, today, include, the, interior, papuans, and, indigenous, australians, in, modern, literature, descendants, of, these, groups, located, in, island, southeast, asia, west, of, halmahera, are, usually, collectively, referred, to, as, negritos, while, descendants, of, these, groups, east, of, halmahera, excluding, indigenous, australians, are, referred, to, as, papuans, they, can, also, be, divided, into, two, broad, groups, based, on, denisovan, admixture, philippine, negritos, papuans, melanesians, and, indigenous, australians, display, denisovan, admixture, while, malaysian, and, western, indonesian, negritos, orang, asli, and, andamanese, islanders, do, not, mahdi, 2017, also, uses, the, term, qata, from, proto, malayo, polynesian, qata, to, distinguish, the, indigenous, populations, of, southeast, asia, versus, tau, from, proto, austronesian, cau, for, the, later, settlers, from, taiwan, and, mainland, china, both, are, based, on, proto, forms, for, the, word, person, in, malayo, polynesian, languages, that, referred, to, darker, skinned, and, lighter, skinned, groups, respectively, jinam, et, al, 2017, also, proposed, the, term, first, sundaland, people, in, place, of, negrito, as, a, more, accurate, name, for, the, original, population, of, southeast, asia, these, populations, are, genetically, distinct, from, later, austronesians, but, through, fairly, extensive, population, admixture, most, modern, austronesians, have, varying, levels, of, ancestry, from, these, groups, the, same, is, true, for, some, populations, historically, considered, non, austronesians, due, to, physical, differences, like, philippine, negritos, orang, asli, and, austronesian, speaking, melanesians, all, of, whom, have, austronesian, admixture, in, polynesians, in, remote, oceania, for, example, the, admixture, is, around, 20, to, 30, papuan, and, 70, to, 80, austronesian, the, melanesians, in, near, oceania, are, roughly, around, 20, austronesian, and, 80, papuan, while, in, the, natives, of, the, lesser, sunda, islands, the, admixture, is, around, 50, austronesian, and, 50, papuan, similarly, in, the, philippines, the, groups, traditionally, considered, to, be, negrito, vary, between, 30, and, 50, austronesian, the, high, degree, of, assimilation, among, austronesian, negrito, and, papuan, groups, indicates, that, the, austronesian, expansion, was, largely, peaceful, rather, than, violent, displacement, the, settlers, and, the, indigenous, groups, absorbed, each, other, it, is, believed, that, in, some, cases, like, in, the, toalean, culture, of, sulawesi, c, 8, 000, 1, 500, bp, it, is, even, more, accurate, to, say, that, the, densely, populated, indigenous, hunter, gatherer, groups, absorbed, the, incoming, austronesian, farmers, rather, than, the, other, way, around, mahdi, 2016, further, asserts, that, proto, malayo, polynesian, tau, mata, person, is, derived, from, a, composite, protoform, cau, ma, qata, combining, tau, and, qata, and, indicative, of, the, mixing, of, the, two, ancestral, population, types, in, these, regions, the, broad, consensus, on, the, urheimat, homeland, of, austronesian, languages, as, well, as, the, neolithic, early, austronesian, peoples, is, accepted, to, be, taiwan, as, well, as, the, penghu, islands, they, are, believed, to, have, descended, from, ancestral, populations, in, coastal, mainland, southern, china, which, are, generally, referred, to, as, the, pre, austronesians, through, these, pre, austronesians, austronesians, may, also, share, a, common, ancestry, with, neighboring, groups, in, neolithic, southern, china, these, neolithic, pre, austronesians, from, the, coast, of, southeastern, china, are, believed, to, have, migrated, to, taiwan, between, approximately, 10, 000, and, 6000, bce, other, research, has, suggested, that, according, to, radiocarbon, dates, austronesians, may, have, migrated, from, mainland, china, to, taiwan, as, late, as, 4000, bce, dapenkeng, culture, they, continued, to, maintain, regular, contact, with, the, mainland, until, 1500, bce, the, identity, of, the, neolithic, pre, austronesian, cultures, in, china, is, contentious, tracing, austronesian, prehistory, in, fujian, and, taiwan, has, been, difficult, due, to, the, southward, expansion, of, the, han, dynasty, 2nd, century, bce, and, the, recent, qing, dynasty, annexation, of, taiwan, 1683, ce, today, the, only, austronesian, language, in, southern, china, is, tsat, spoken, in, hainan, the, politicization, of, archaeology, is, also, problematic, particularly, erroneous, reconstructions, among, some, chinese, archaeologists, of, non, sinitic, sites, as, han, some, authors, favoring, the, out, of, sundaland, model, like, william, meacham, reject, the, southern, chinese, mainland, origin, of, pre, austronesians, entirely, nevertheless, based, on, linguistic, archaeological, and, genetic, evidence, austronesians, are, most, strongly, associated, with, the, early, farming, cultures, of, the, yangtze, river, basin, that, domesticated, rice, from, around, 13, 500, to, 8, 200, bp, they, display, typical, austronesian, technological, hallmarks, including, tooth, removal, teeth, blackening, jade, carving, tattooing, stilt, houses, advanced, boatbuilding, aquaculture, wetland, agriculture, and, the, domestication, of, dogs, pigs, and, chickens, these, include, the, kuahuqiao, hemudu, majiabang, songze, liangzhu, and, dapenkeng, cultures, that, occupied, the, coastal, regions, between, the, yangtze, river, delta, and, the, min, river, delta, based, on, linguistic, evidence, there, have, been, proposals, linking, austronesians, with, other, linguistic, families, into, linguistic, macrofamilies, that, are, relevant, to, the, identity, of, the, pre, austronesian, populations, the, most, notable, are, the, connections, of, austronesians, to, the, neighboring, austroasiatic, kra, dai, and, sinitic, peoples, as, austric, austro, tai, and, sino, austronesian, respectively, these, are, still, not, widely, accepted, as, evidence, of, these, relationships, are, still, tenuous, and, the, methods, used, are, highly, contentious, in, support, of, both, the, austric, and, austro, tai, hypothesis, robert, blust, connects, the, lower, yangtze, neolithic, austro, tai, entity, with, the, rice, cultivating, austroasiatic, cultures, assuming, the, center, of, east, asian, rice, domestication, and, putative, austric, homeland, to, be, located, in, the, yunnan, burma, border, area, 188, instead, of, the, yangtze, river, basin, as, is, currently, accepted, under, that, view, there, was, an, east, west, genetic, alignment, resulting, from, a, rice, based, population, expansion, in, the, southern, part, of, east, asia, austroasiatic, kra, dai, austronesian, with, unrelated, sino, tibetan, occupying, a, more, northerly, tier, 188, depending, on, the, author, other, hypotheses, have, also, included, other, language, families, like, hmong, mien, and, even, japanese, ryukyuan, into, the, larger, austric, hypothesis, while, the, austric, hypothesis, remains, contentious, there, is, genetic, evidence, that, at, least, in, western, island, southeast, asia, there, had, been, earlier, neolithic, overland, migrations, pre, 4, 000, bp, by, austroasiatic, speaking, peoples, into, what, is, now, the, greater, sunda, islands, when, the, sea, levels, were, lower, in, the, early, holocene, these, peoples, were, assimilated, linguistically, and, culturally, by, incoming, austronesian, peoples, in, what, is, now, modern, day, indonesia, and, malaysia, several, authors, have, also, proposed, that, kra, dai, speakers, may, actually, be, an, ancient, daughter, subgroup, of, austronesians, that, migrated, back, to, the, pearl, river, delta, from, taiwan, and, or, luzon, shortly, after, the, austronesian, expansion, later, migrating, further, westwards, to, hainan, mainland, southeast, asia, and, northeast, india, they, propose, that, the, distinctiveness, of, kra, dai, it, is, tonal, and, monosyllabic, was, the, result, of, linguistic, restructuring, due, to, contact, with, hmong, mien, and, sinitic, cultures, aside, from, linguistic, evidence, roger, blench, has, also, noted, cultural, similarities, between, the, two, groups, like, facial, tattooing, tooth, removal, or, ablation, teeth, blackening, snake, or, dragon, cults, and, the, multiple, tongued, jaw, harps, shared, by, the, indigenous, taiwanese, and, kra, dai, speakers, however, archaeological, evidence, for, this, is, still, sparse, this, is, believed, to, be, similar, to, what, happened, to, the, cham, people, who, were, originally, austronesian, settlers, likely, from, borneo, to, southern, vietnam, around, 2100, 1900, bp, and, had, languages, similar, to, malay, their, languages, underwent, several, restructuring, events, to, syntax, and, phonology, due, to, contact, with, the, nearby, tonal, languages, of, mainland, southeast, asia, and, hainan, although, the, populations, of, the, malay, peninsula, sumatra, java, and, neighboring, islands, are, austronesian, speaking, they, have, significantly, high, admixture, from, mainland, southeast, asian, populations, these, areas, were, already, populated, most, probably, by, speakers, of, austroasiatic, languages, before, they, were, reached, by, the, austronesian, expansion, roughly, 3, 000, years, ago, currently, only, the, indigenous, aslians, still, speak, austroasiatic, languages, however, some, of, the, languages, in, the, region, show, signs, of, underlying, austroasiatic, substrates, according, to, juha, janhunen, and, ann, kumar, austronesians, may, have, also, settled, parts, of, southern, japan, especially, on, the, islands, of, kyushu, and, shikoku, and, influenced, or, created, the, japanese, hierarchical, society, it, is, suggested, that, japanese, tribes, like, the, hayato, people, the, kumaso, and, the, azumi, were, of, austronesian, origin, until, today, local, traditions, and, festivals, show, similarities, to, malayo, polynesian, culture, the, sino, austronesian, hypothesis, on, the, other, hand, is, a, relatively, new, hypothesis, by, laurent, sagart, first, proposed, in, 1990, it, argues, for, a, north, south, linguistic, genetic, relationship, between, chinese, and, austronesian, this, is, based, on, sound, correspondences, in, basic, vocabulary, and, morphological, parallels, 188, sagart, places, special, significance, in, shared, vocabulary, on, cereal, crops, citing, them, as, evidence, of, shared, linguistic, origin, however, this, has, largely, been, rejected, by, other, linguists, the, sound, correspondences, between, old, chinese, and, proto, austronesian, can, also, be, explained, as, a, result, of, the, longshan, interaction, sphere, when, pre, austronesians, from, the, yangtze, region, came, into, regular, contact, with, proto, sinitic, speakers, in, the, shandong, peninsula, around, the, 4th, to, 3rd, millennia, bce, this, corresponded, with, the, widespread, introduction, of, rice, cultivation, to, proto, sinitic, speakers, and, conversely, millet, cultivation, to, pre, austronesians, an, austronesian, substratum, in, formerly, austronesian, territories, that, have, been, sinicized, after, the, iron, age, han, expansion, is, also, another, explanation, for, the, correspondences, that, do, not, require, a, genetic, relationship, in, relation, to, sino, austronesian, models, and, the, longshan, interaction, sphere, roger, blench, 2014, suggests, that, the, single, migration, model, for, the, spread, of, the, neolithic, into, taiwan, is, problematic, pointing, out, the, genetic, and, linguistic, inconsistencies, between, different, taiwanese, austronesian, groups, 1, 17, the, surviving, austronesian, populations, in, taiwan, should, rather, be, considered, as, the, result, of, various, neolithic, migration, waves, from, the, mainland, and, back, migration, from, the, philippines, 1, 17, these, incoming, migrants, almost, certainly, spoke, languages, related, to, austronesian, or, pre, austronesian, although, their, phonology, and, grammar, would, have, been, quite, diverse, blench, considers, the, austronesians, in, taiwan, to, have, been, a, melting, pot, of, immigrants, from, various, parts, of, the, coast, of, east, china, that, had, been, migrating, to, taiwan, by, 4000, bp, these, immigrants, included, people, from, the, foxtail, millet, cultivating, longshan, culture, of, shandong, with, longshan, type, cultures, found, in, southern, taiwan, the, fishing, based, dapenkeng, culture, of, coastal, fujian, and, the, yuanshan, culture, of, northernmost, taiwan, which, blench, suggests, may, have, originated, from, the, coast, of, guangdong, based, on, geography, and, cultural, vocabulary, blench, believes, that, the, yuanshan, people, may, have, spoken, northeast, formosan, languages, thus, blench, believes, that, there, is, in, fact, no, apical, ancestor, of, austronesian, in, the, sense, that, there, was, no, true, single, proto, austronesian, language, that, gave, rise, to, present, day, austronesian, languages, instead, multiple, migrations, of, various, pre, austronesian, peoples, and, languages, from, the, chinese, mainland, that, were, related, but, distinct, came, together, to, form, what, we, now, know, as, austronesian, in, taiwan, hence, blench, considers, the, single, migration, model, into, taiwan, by, pre, austronesians, to, be, inconsistent, with, both, the, archaeological, and, linguistic, lexical, evidence, the, austronesian, expansion, also, called, the, out, of, taiwan, model, is, a, large, scale, migration, of, austronesians, from, taiwan, occurring, around, 3000, to, 1500, bce, population, growth, primarily, fueled, this, migration, these, first, settlers, settled, in, northern, luzon, in, the, archipelago, of, the, philippines, intermingling, with, the, earlier, australo, melanesian, population, who, had, inhabited, the, islands, since, about, 23, 000, years, earlier, over, the, next, thousand, years, austronesian, peoples, migrated, southeast, to, the, rest, of, the, philippines, and, into, the, islands, of, the, celebes, sea, and, borneo, from, southwestern, borneo, austronesians, spread, further, west, in, a, single, migration, event, to, both, sumatra, and, the, coastal, regions, of, southern, vietnam, becoming, the, ancestors, of, the, speakers, of, the, malayic, and, chamic, branches, of, the, austronesian, language, family, soon, after, reaching, the, philippines, austronesians, colonized, the, northern, mariana, islands, by, 1500, bce, or, even, earlier, becoming, the, first, humans, to, reach, remote, oceania, the, chamorro, migration, was, also, unique, in, that, it, was, the, only, austronesian, migration, to, the, pacific, islands, to, successfully, retain, rice, cultivation, palau, and, yap, were, settled, by, separate, voyages, by, 1000, bce, another, important, migration, branch, was, by, the, lapita, culture, which, rapidly, spread, into, the, islands, off, the, coast, of, northern, new, guinea, and, into, the, solomon, islands, and, other, parts, of, coastal, new, guinea, and, island, melanesia, by, 1200, bce, they, reached, the, islands, of, fiji, samoa, and, tonga, by, around, 900, to, 800, bce, this, remained, the, furthest, extent, of, the, austronesian, expansion, into, polynesia, until, around, 700, ce, when, there, was, another, surge, of, island, colonization, it, reached, the, cook, islands, tahiti, and, the, marquesas, by, 700, ce, hawaii, by, 900, ce, rapa, nui, by, 1000, ce, and, new, zealand, by, 1200, ce, for, a, few, centuries, the, polynesian, islands, were, connected, by, bidirectional, long, distance, sailing, with, the, exception, of, rapa, nui, which, had, limited, further, contact, due, to, its, isolated, geographical, location, island, groups, like, the, pitcairns, the, kermadec, islands, and, the, norfolk, islands, were, also, formerly, settled, by, austronesians, but, later, abandoned, there, is, also, putative, evidence, based, in, the, spread, of, the, sweet, potato, that, austronesians, may, have, reached, south, america, from, polynesia, where, they, might, have, traded, with, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, in, the, indian, ocean, austronesians, in, maritime, southeast, asia, established, trade, links, with, south, asia, they, also, established, early, long, distance, contacts, with, africa, possibly, as, early, as, before, 500, bce, based, on, archaeological, evidence, like, banana, phytoliths, in, cameroon, and, uganda, and, remains, of, neolithic, chicken, bones, in, zanzibar, by, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, bce, austronesians, were, already, sailing, maritime, trade, routes, linking, the, han, dynasty, of, china, with, the, western, indian, ocean, trade, in, india, the, roman, empire, and, africa, 610, 611, an, austronesian, group, originally, from, the, makassar, strait, region, around, kalimantan, and, sulawesi, eventually, settled, madagascar, either, directly, from, southeast, asia, or, from, preexisting, mixed, austronesian, bantu, populations, from, east, africa, estimates, for, when, this, occurred, vary, from, the, 5th, to, 7th, centuries, ce, it, is, likely, that, the, austronesians, that, settled, madagascar, followed, a, coastal, route, through, south, asia, and, east, africa, rather, than, directly, across, the, indian, ocean, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, some, individuals, of, austronesian, descent, reached, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, a, competing, hypothesis, to, the, out, of, taiwan, model, is, the, out, of, sundaland, hypothesis, favored, by, a, minority, of, authors, notable, proponents, include, william, meacham, stephen, oppenheimer, and, wilhelm, solheim, for, various, reasons, they, have, proposed, that, the, homelands, of, austronesians, were, within, island, southeast, asia, isea, particularly, in, the, sundaland, landmass, drowned, during, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, by, rising, sea, levels, proponents, of, these, hypotheses, point, to, the, ancient, origins, of, mtdna, in, southeast, asian, populations, pre, dating, the, austronesian, expansion, as, proof, that, austronesians, originated, from, within, island, southeast, asia, however, these, have, been, repudiated, by, studies, using, whole, genome, sequencing, which, have, found, that, all, isea, populations, had, genes, originating, from, aboriginal, taiwanese, contrary, to, the, claim, of, a, south, to, north, migration, in, the, out, of, sundaland, hypothesis, the, new, whole, genome, analysis, strongly, confirms, the, north, to, south, dispersal, of, the, austronesian, peoples, in, the, prevailing, out, of, taiwan, hypothesis, researchers, have, further, pointed, out, that, while, humans, have, been, living, in, sundaland, for, at, least, 40, 000, years, the, austronesian, people, were, recent, arrivals, the, results, of, the, previous, studies, failed, to, take, into, account, admixture, with, the, more, ancient, but, unrelated, negrito, and, papuan, populations, by, the, beginning, of, the, first, millennium, ce, most, of, the, austronesian, inhabitants, in, maritime, southeast, asia, began, trading, with, india, and, china, the, adoption, of, the, hindu, statecraft, model, allowed, the, creation, of, indianized, kingdoms, such, as, tarumanagara, champa, butuan, langkasuka, melayu, srivijaya, mataram, majapahit, and, bali, between, the, 5th, and, the, 15th, century, hinduism, and, buddhism, were, established, as, the, main, religion, in, the, region, muslim, traders, from, the, arabian, peninsula, were, thought, to, have, brought, islam, by, the, 10th, century, this, was, established, as, the, dominant, religion, in, the, malay, archipelago, by, the, 16th, century, the, austronesian, inhabitants, of, near, oceania, and, remote, oceania, were, unaffected, by, this, cultural, trade, and, retained, their, indigenous, culture, in, the, pacific, region, the, kingdom, of, larantuka, in, flores, east, nusa, tenggara, was, the, only, christian, roman, catholic, indigenous, kingdom, in, indonesia, and, in, southeast, asia, with, its, first, king, named, lorenzo, western, europeans, in, search, of, spices, and, gold, later, colonized, most, of, the, austronesian, speaking, countries, of, the, asia, pacific, region, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, with, the, portuguese, and, spanish, colonization, of, the, philippines, palau, guam, the, mariana, islands, and, some, parts, of, indonesia, present, day, east, timor, the, dutch, colonization, of, the, indonesian, archipelago, the, british, colonization, of, malaysia, and, oceania, the, french, colonization, of, french, polynesia, and, later, the, american, governance, of, the, pacific, meanwhile, the, british, germans, french, americans, and, japanese, began, establishing, spheres, of, influence, within, the, pacific, islands, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, japanese, later, invaded, most, of, southeast, asia, and, some, parts, of, the, pacific, during, world, war, ii, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, initiated, independence, of, modern, day, indonesia, malaysia, east, timor, and, many, of, the, pacific, island, nations, as, well, as, the, re, independence, of, the, philippines, the, native, culture, of, austronesia, varies, from, region, to, region, the, early, austronesian, peoples, considered, the, sea, as, the, basic, feature, of, their, life, following, their, diaspora, to, southeast, asia, and, oceania, they, migrated, by, boat, to, other, islands, boats, of, different, sizes, and, shapes, have, been, found, in, every, austronesian, culture, from, madagascar, maritime, southeast, asia, to, polynesia, and, have, different, names, in, southeast, asia, head, hunting, was, restricted, to, the, highlands, as, a, result, of, warfare, mummification, is, only, found, among, the, highland, austronesian, filipinos, and, in, some, indonesian, groups, in, celebes, and, borneo, seagoing, catamaran, and, outrigger, ship, technologies, were, the, most, important, innovations, of, the, austronesian, peoples, they, were, the, first, humans, with, vessels, capable, of, crossing, vast, distances, of, water, the, crossing, from, the, philippines, to, the, mariana, islands, at, around, 1500, bce, a, distance, of, more, than, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, is, likely, the, world, s, first, and, longest, ocean, crossing, of, that, time, these, maritime, technologies, enabled, them, to, colonize, the, indo, pacific, in, prehistoric, times, austronesian, groups, continue, to, be, the, primary, users, of, outrigger, canoes, today, early, researchers, like, heine, geldern, 1932, and, hornell, 1943, once, believed, that, catamarans, evolved, from, outrigger, canoes, but, modern, authors, specializing, in, austronesian, cultures, like, doran, 1981, and, mahdi, 1988, now, believe, it, to, be, the, opposite, two, canoes, bound, together, developed, directly, from, minimal, raft, technologies, of, two, logs, tied, together, over, time, the, double, hulled, canoe, form, developed, into, the, asymmetric, double, canoe, where, one, hull, is, smaller, than, the, other, eventually, the, smaller, hull, became, the, prototype, outrigger, giving, way, to, the, single, outrigger, canoe, then, to, the, reversible, single, outrigger, canoe, finally, the, single, outrigger, types, developed, into, the, double, outrigger, canoe, or, trimarans, this, would, also, explain, why, older, austronesian, populations, in, island, southeast, asia, tend, to, favor, double, outrigger, canoes, as, it, keeps, the, boats, stable, when, tacking, however, there, are, small, regions, where, catamarans, and, single, outrigger, canoes, are, still, used, in, contrast, more, distant, outlying, descendant, populations, in, micronesia, polynesia, madagascar, and, the, comoros, retained, the, double, hull, and, the, single, outrigger, canoe, types, but, the, technology, for, double, outriggers, never, reached, them, although, it, exists, in, western, melanesia, to, deal, with, the, problem, of, the, boat, s, instability, when, the, outrigger, faces, leeward, when, tacking, they, instead, developed, the, shunting, technique, in, sailing, in, conjunction, with, reversible, single, outriggers, the, simplest, form, of, all, ancestral, austronesian, boats, had, five, parts, the, bottom, consisted, of, a, single, piece, of, hollowed, out, log, at, the, sides, were, two, planks, and, two, horseshoe, shaped, wood, pieces, formed, the, prow, and, stern, these, were, fitted, tightly, together, edge, to, edge, with, dowels, inserted, into, holes, in, between, and, then, lashed, to, each, other, with, ropes, made, from, rattan, or, fibre, wrapped, around, protruding, lugs, on, the, planks, this, characteristic, and, ancient, austronesian, boatbuilding, practice, is, known, as, the, lashed, lug, technique, they, were, commonly, caulked, with, pastes, made, from, various, plants, as, well, as, tapa, bark, and, fibres, that, would, expand, when, wet, further, tightening, joints, and, making, the, hull, watertight, they, formed, the, shell, of, the, boat, which, was, then, reinforced, by, horizontal, ribs, shipwrecks, of, austronesian, ships, can, be, identified, from, this, construction, as, well, as, the, absence, of, metal, nails, austronesian, ships, traditionally, had, no, central, rudders, but, were, instead, steered, using, an, oar, on, one, side, the, ancestral, rig, was, the, mastless, triangular, crab, claw, sail, which, had, two, booms, that, could, be, tilted, to, the, wind, these, were, built, in, the, double, canoe, configuration, or, had, a, single, outrigger, on, the, windward, side, in, island, southeast, asia, these, developed, into, double, outriggers, on, each, side, which, provided, greater, stability, the, triangular, crab, claw, sails, also, later, developed, into, square, or, rectangular, tanja, sails, which, like, crab, claw, sails, had, distinctive, booms, spanning, the, upper, and, lower, edges, fixed, masts, also, developed, later, in, both, southeast, asia, usually, as, bipod, or, tripod, masts, and, oceania, austronesians, traditionally, made, their, sails, from, woven, mats, of, the, resilient, and, salt, resistant, pandanus, leaves, these, sails, allowed, them, to, embark, on, long, distance, voyaging, in, some, cases, however, they, were, one, way, voyages, the, failure, to, establish, populations, in, rapa, nui, and, new, zealand, is, believed, to, have, isolated, their, settlements, from, the, rest, of, polynesia, the, ancient, champa, of, vietnam, also, uniquely, developed, basket, hulled, boats, whose, hulls, were, composed, of, woven, and, resin, caulked, bamboo, either, entirely, or, in, conjunction, with, plank, strakes, they, ranged, from, small, coracles, o, th, ng, to, large, oceangoing, trading, ships, like, the, ghe, m, nh, the, acquisition, of, catamaran, and, outrigger, technology, by, non, austronesian, peoples, in, sri, lanka, and, southern, india, is, due, to, the, result, of, very, early, austronesian, contact, with, the, region, including, the, maldives, and, the, laccadive, islands, estimated, to, have, occurred, around, 1000, to, 600, bce, and, onwards, this, may, have, possibly, included, limited, colonization, by, people, who, have, since, been, assimilated, this, is, still, evident, in, sri, lankan, and, south, indian, languages, for, example, tamil, pa, avu, telugu, pa, ava, and, kannada, pa, ahu, all, meaning, ship, are, all, derived, from, proto, hesperonesian, padaw, sailboat, with, austronesian, cognates, like, sundanese, parahu, javanese, perahu, kadazan, padau, maranao, padaw, cebuano, par, w, samoan, folau, hawaiian, halau, and, m, ori, wharau, austronesian, architecture, is, diverse, but, often, shares, certain, characteristics, that, indicate, a, common, origin, the, reconstructed, proto, austronesian, and, proto, malayo, polynesian, forms, of, various, terms, for, house, building, or, granary, among, the, different, linguistic, subgroups, of, austronesians, include, rumaq, house, balay, public, building, community, house, or, guest, house, lepaw, hut, field, hut, or, granary, kamalir, bachelor, s, house, or, men, s, house, and, banua, inhabited, land, or, community, territory, austronesian, structures, commonly, have, raised, floors, the, structures, are, raised, on, piles, usually, with, space, underneath, also, utilized, for, storage, or, domestic, animals, the, raised, design, has, multiple, advantages, including, mitigating, damage, during, flooding, and, in, very, tall, examples, acting, as, defensive, structures, during, conflicts, the, house, posts, are, also, distinctively, capped, with, larger, diameter, discs, at, the, top, to, prevent, vermin, and, pests, from, entering, the, structures, by, climbing, them, austronesian, houses, and, other, structures, are, usually, built, in, wetlands, and, alongside, bodies, of, water, but, can, also, be, constructed, in, the, highlands, or, even, directly, on, shallow, water, building, structures, on, pilings, is, believed, to, be, derived, from, the, design, of, raised, granaries, and, storehouses, which, are, highly, important, status, symbols, among, the, ancestrally, rice, cultivating, austronesians, the, rice, granary, shrine, was, also, the, archetypal, religious, building, among, austronesian, cultures, and, was, used, to, store, carvings, of, ancestor, spirits, and, local, deities, another, common, feature, are, pitched, roofs, with, ornamented, gables, the, most, notable, of, these, are, saddlebacked, roofs, a, design, common, for, longhouses, used, for, village, meetings, or, ceremonies, the, overall, effect, of, this, is, reminiscent, of, a, boat, underlining, the, strong, maritime, connections, of, austronesian, cultures, the, boat, motif, is, common, throughout, particularly, in, eastern, indonesia, in, some, ethnic, groups, the, houses, are, built, on, platforms, that, resemble, catamarans, among, the, nage, people, a, woven, representation, of, a, boat, is, added, to, the, ridge, of, the, roof, among, the, manggarai, people, the, roofs, of, houses, are, shaped, like, an, upside, down, boat, while, among, the, people, of, tanimbar, and, eastern, flores, the, ridge, itself, is, carved, into, a, representation, of, a, boat, furthermore, elements, of, austronesian, structures, as, well, as, society, in, general, are, often, referred, to, in, terminologies, used, for, boats, and, sailing, these, include, calling, elements, of, structures, masts, sails, or, rudders, or, calling, the, village, leaders, captains, or, steersmen, in, the, case, of, the, philippines, the, villages, themselves, are, referred, to, as, barangay, from, an, alternate, form, of, balangay, a, type, of, sailboat, used, for, trading, and, colonization, austronesian, buildings, have, spiritual, significance, often, containing, what, has, been, coined, by, anthropologist, james, j, fox, as, a, ritual, attractor, these, are, specific, posts, beams, platforms, altars, and, so, on, that, embody, the, house, as, a, whole, usually, consecrated, at, the, time, of, building, the, austronesian, house, itself, also, often, symbolizes, various, aspects, of, indigenous, austronesian, cosmology, and, animism, in, the, majority, of, cases, the, loft, of, the, house, usually, placed, above, the, hearth, is, considered, to, be, the, domain, of, deities, and, spirits, it, is, essentially, a, raised, granary, built, into, the, structure, of, the, house, itself, and, functioning, as, a, second, floor, it, is, commonly, used, to, store, sacred, objects, like, effigies, of, granary, idols, or, deceased, ancestors, heirlooms, and, other, important, objects, these, areas, are, usually, not, part, of, the, regular, living, space, and, may, only, be, accessible, to, certain, members, of, the, family, or, after, performing, a, specific, ritual, other, parts, of, the, house, may, also, be, associated, with, certain, deities, and, thus, certain, activities, like, receiving, guests, or, conducting, marriage, ceremonies, can, only, be, performed, in, specific, areas, while, rice, cultivation, wasn, t, among, the, technologies, carried, into, remote, oceania, raised, storehouses, still, survived, the, pataka, of, the, m, ori, people, is, an, example, the, largest, pataka, are, elaborately, adorned, with, carvings, and, are, often, the, tallest, buildings, in, the, m, ori, p, these, were, used, to, store, implements, weapons, ships, and, other, valuables, while, smaller, pataka, were, used, to, store, provisions, a, special, type, of, pataka, supported, by, a, single, tall, post, also, had, ritual, importance, and, was, used, to, isolate, high, born, children, during, their, training, for, leadership, the, majority, of, austronesian, structures, are, not, permanent, they, are, made, from, perishable, materials, like, wood, bamboo, plant, fibre, and, leaves, similar, to, traditional, austronesian, boats, they, do, not, use, nails, but, are, traditionally, constructed, solely, by, joints, weaving, ties, and, dowels, elements, of, the, structures, are, repaired, and, replaced, regularly, or, as, they, get, damaged, because, of, this, archaeological, records, of, prehistoric, austronesian, structures, are, usually, limited, to, traces, of, house, posts, with, no, way, of, determining, the, original, building, plans, indirect, evidence, of, traditional, austronesian, architecture, however, can, be, gleaned, from, their, contemporary, representations, in, art, such, as, friezes, on, the, walls, of, later, hindu, buddhist, stone, temples, like, in, reliefs, at, borobudur, and, prambanan, but, these, are, limited, to, the, recent, centuries, they, can, also, be, reconstructed, linguistically, from, shared, terms, for, architectural, elements, like, ridge, poles, thatch, rafters, house, posts, hearths, notched, log, ladders, storage, racks, public, buildings, and, so, on, linguistic, evidence, also, makes, it, clear, that, stilt, houses, were, already, present, among, austronesian, groups, since, at, least, the, late, neolithic, in, modern, indonesia, varying, styles, are, collectively, known, as, rumah, adat, arbi, et, al, 2013, have, also, noted, the, striking, similarities, between, austronesian, architecture, and, japanese, traditional, raised, architecture, shinmei, zukuri, particularly, the, buildings, of, the, ise, grand, shrine, which, contrast, with, the, pit, houses, typical, of, the, neolithic, yayoi, period, they, propose, significant, neolithic, contact, between, the, people, of, southern, japan, and, austronesians, or, pre, austronesians, that, occurred, prior, to, the, spread, of, han, chinese, cultural, influence, to, the, islands, rice, cultivation, is, also, believed, to, have, been, introduced, to, japan, from, a, para, austronesian, group, from, coastal, eastern, china, waterson, 2009, has, also, argued, that, the, architectural, tradition, of, stilt, houses, is, originally, austronesian, and, that, similar, building, traditions, in, japan, and, mainland, asia, notably, among, kra, dai, and, austroasiatic, speaking, groups, correspond, to, contacts, with, a, prehistoric, austronesian, network, outside, of, taiwan, assemblages, of, red, slipped, pottery, plainware, and, incised, and, stamped, pottery, associated, with, austronesian, migrations, are, first, documented, from, around, 2000, to, 1800, bce, in, the, northern, philippines, from, sites, in, the, batanes, islands, and, the, cagayan, valley, of, northern, luzon, from, there, pottery, technology, rapidly, spread, to, the, east, south, and, southwest, this, type, of, pottery, dispersed, south, and, southwest, to, the, rest, of, island, southeast, asia, the, eastward, and, southward, branches, of, the, migrations, converged, in, island, melanesia, resulting, in, what, is, now, known, as, the, lapita, culture, centered, around, the, bismarck, archipelago, the, oldest, known, pottery, assemblages, in, oceania, are, circle, and, punctate, dentate, stamped, pottery, in, the, marianas, islands, securely, dated, to, 1500, bce, 1300, bce, from, multiple, archaeological, sites, it, predates, the, earliest, lapita, culture, pottery, assemblages, c, 1350, 1300, bce, and, bears, closest, resemblance, to, a, subset, of, the, more, diverse, nagsabaran, pottery, of, the, northern, philippines, it, is, currently, disputed, whether, this, is, indicative, of, a, direct, ancient, voyage, from, the, northern, philippines, to, the, marianas, hung, et, al, 2011, proposed, a, direct, deliberate, voyage, from, eastern, luzon, which, would, make, it, the, longest, sea, crossing, undertaken, by, that, time, in, human, history, this, has, also, been, proposed, by, earlier, authors, like, blust, 2000, and, reid, 2002, based, on, linguistics, winter, et, al, 2012, on, the, other, hand, dismissed, the, similarities, as, being, generic, rather, than, specific, to, the, region, this, is, from, both, analysis, of, the, microscopic, structure, of, the, shards, indicating, manufacturing, techniques, and, the, impossibility, of, drift, voyaging, from, luzon, due, to, the, prevailing, wind, and, currents, instead, of, a, voyage, directly, from, luzon, they, instead, proposed, an, origin, either, from, a, direct, single, voyage, from, mindanao, southern, philippines, or, morotai, maluku, islands, to, guam, or, two, voyages, with, way, stations, in, palau, or, yap, hung, et, al, 2012, pointed, out, in, response, that, no, pottery, assemblages, older, than, 2, 000, years, old, have, been, found, in, morotai, which, also, has, a, papuan, speaking, population, they, also, mentioned, that, present, day, data, on, wind, and, currents, is, not, a, reliable, way, of, ascertaining, migration, routes, and, that, the, voyages, settling, remote, oceania, would, have, been, deliberate, not, uncontrolled, drifting, similar, presumptions, by, thor, heyerdahl, led, to, his, erroneous, conclusion, that, polynesia, was, settled, from, the, americas, pottery, manufacturing, techniques, are, also, diverse, even, within, a, single, community, thus, analysis, of, manufacturing, methods, is, less, significant, than, comparison, of, decorative, systems, nevertheless, hung, et, al, 2012, emphasized, that, they, also, did, not, discount, other, sources, yet, undiscovered, from, the, southern, philippines, they, also, proposed, the, eastern, visayas, as, a, likely, point, of, origin, sources, south, of, the, philippines, remain, unlikely, without, further, archaeological, findings, due, to, their, related, pottery, assemblages, being, younger, than, 1500, bce, the, dentate, stamped, pottery, of, the, lapita, culture, c, 1350, 1300, bce, retained, elements, also, found, in, the, nagsabaran, pottery, in, the, philippines, including, stamped, circles, as, well, as, the, cross, in, circle, motif, they, carried, pottery, technology, as, far, as, tonga, in, polynesia, pottery, technology, in, tonga, however, became, reduced, to, undecorated, plainware, within, only, two, centuries, before, abruptly, disappearing, completely, by, around, 400, bce, the, reasons, for, this, are, still, unknown, pottery, was, absent, in, subsequent, migrations, to, the, rest, of, remote, oceania, being, replaced, instead, with, carved, wooden, or, bamboo, containers, bottle, gourds, and, baskets, however, the, geometric, designs, and, stylized, figures, used, in, the, pottery, are, still, present, in, other, surviving, art, forms, such, as, tattooing, weaving, and, barkcloth, patterns, a, common, practice, among, austronesians, in, a, large, area, of, island, southeast, asia, is, the, use, of, burial, jars, which, emerged, during, the, late, neolithic, and, flourished, in, the, first, millennium, ce, they, are, characteristic, of, a, region, bordered, by, the, philippines, to, the, north, southern, sumatra, in, the, southwest, and, sumba, and, the, maluku, islands, in, the, southeast, however, these, didn, t, comprise, a, single, tradition, but, can, be, grouped, into, at, least, fourteen, different, traditions, scattered, across, the, islands, in, most, cases, the, earliest, burial, jars, used, were, large, indigenous, earthenware, jars, followed, by, indigenous, or, imported, stoneware, jars, martaban, and, finally, imported, porcelain, jars, acquired, from, the, burgeoning, maritime, trade, with, china, and, mainland, southeast, asia, around, the, 14th, century, ce, slit, drums, are, indigenous, austronesian, musical, instruments, invented, and, used, by, southeast, asian, austronesian, and, oceanic, austronesian, ethnic, groups, gong, ensembles, are, also, a, common, musical, heritage, of, island, southeast, asia, the, casting, of, gong, instruments, is, believed, to, have, originated, from, the, bronze, age, cultures, of, mainland, southeast, asia, it, spread, to, the, austronesian, islands, initially, through, trade, as, prestige, goods, however, mainland, asian, gongs, were, never, used, in, ensembles, the, innovation, of, using, gong, sets, is, uniquely, austronesian, gong, ensembles, are, found, in, western, malayo, polynesian, groups, though, they, never, penetrated, much, further, east, there, are, roughly, two, gong, ensemble, traditions, among, austronesians, which, also, produced, gongs, in, ancient, times, in, western, island, southeast, asia, these, traditions, are, collectively, known, as, gamelan, being, centred, on, the, island, of, java, in, indonesia, they, include, the, celempung, of, the, malay, peninsula, talempung, of, northern, sumatra, caklempung, of, central, sumatra, chalempung, of, southern, sumatra, bonang, of, java, kromong, of, western, kalimantan, engkromong, of, sarawak, and, trompong, of, western, nusa, tenggara, in, eastern, island, southeast, asia, these, traditions, are, known, as, kulintang, and, are, centred, in, mindanao, and, the, sulu, archipelago, of, the, southern, philippines, they, include, the, kulintangan, of, sabah, and, palawan, kolintang, of, northern, sulawesi, kulintang, of, halmahera, and, timor, and, totobuang, of, the, southern, maluku, islands, the, ancestral, pre, austronesian, liangzhu, culture, 3400, 2250, bce, of, the, yangtze, river, delta, was, one, of, the, ancient, centres, of, neolithic, jade, carving, jade, was, spread, to, taiwan, by, around, 3, 000, bce, then, further, into, the, philippines, at, 2, 000, bce, and, vietnam, at, 1, 800, 1, 500, bce, all, of, them, began, to, produce, various, tools, and, ornaments, in, indigenous, jade, workshops, including, adzes, bracelets, beads, and, rings, the, most, notable, jade, products, of, these, regions, were, the, vast, amounts, of, penannular, in, the, form, of, an, incomplete, circle, and, double, headed, earrings, and, pendants, known, as, lingling, o, primarily, produced, in, the, philippines, and, the, sa, hu, nh, culture, of, vietnam, mostly, with, raw, jade, material, sourced, from, eastern, taiwan, these, typically, depicted, two, headed, animals, or, were, ring, shaped, with, side, projections, they, were, indicative, of, a, very, active, ancient, maritime, trading, region, known, as, the, sa, huynh, kalanay, interaction, sphere, that, imported, and, exported, raw, jade, and, finished, jade, ornaments, they, were, produced, during, a, period, from, 500, bce, to, as, late, as, 1000, ce, although, later, examples, were, replaced, with, metal, wood, bone, clay, green, mica, black, nephrite, or, shell, materials, rather, than, green, jade, polished, and, ground, stone, adzes, gouges, and, other, implements, some, of, which, are, made, from, jade, like, stone, have, also, been, recorded, in, areas, of, island, melanesia, and, eastern, new, guinea, associated, with, the, lapita, culture, these, were, considered, valuable, currency, and, were, primarily, used, to, trade, for, goods, in, 2012, a, lapita, jadeite, gouge, used, for, wood, carving, was, found, on, emirau, island, in, the, bismarck, archipelago, it, was, dated, to, around, 3, 300, bce, but, the, origin, of, the, jade, material, is, unknown, similar, stone, tools, have, also, been, found, in, new, caledonia, jade, was, absent, in, most, of, remote, oceania, due, to, the, lack, of, deposits, however, there, is, putative, evidence, that, polynesians, may, have, remained, familiar, with, jade, and, may, acquired, it, through, prehistoric, trade, contacts, with, new, caledonia, island, melanesia, and, or, new, zealand, jade, carving, traditions, reappeared, among, the, m, ori, people, of, new, zealand, these, were, produced, from, locally, sourced, pounamu, greenstone, and, were, used, to, produce, taonga, treasure, they, include, various, tools, and, weapons, like, adzes, scrapers, fishing, hooks, and, mere, as, well, as, ornaments, like, the, hei, tiki, and, hei, matau, certain, ornaments, like, the, pekapeka, double, headed, animal, pendant, and, the, k, k, p, ria, bird, leg, ring, bear, remarkably, strong, resemblances, to, the, double, headed, and, ring, type, lingling, o, bellwood, et, al, 2011, has, suggested, that, the, reappearance, of, these, motifs, might, be, evidence, of, a, preserved, tradition, of, southeast, asian, jade, motifs, perhaps, carved, in, perishable, wood, bone, or, shell, by, polynesians, prior, to, the, reacquisition, of, a, jade, source, or, they, might, even, be, the, result, of, later, iron, age, contact, between, eastern, polynesia, and, the, philippines, there, are, approximately, six, to, seven, hundred, rock, art, sites, discovered, in, southeast, asia, and, island, melanesia, as, well, as, over, eight, hundred, megalithic, sites, the, sites, specifically, associated, with, the, austronesian, expansion, contain, examples, of, indigenous, pictograms, and, petroglyphs, within, southeast, asia, the, sites, associated, with, austronesians, can, be, divided, into, three, general, rock, art, traditions, the, megalithic, culture, of, borneo, sulawesi, and, the, greater, sunda, islands, the, austronesian, painting, tradition, apt, of, the, lesser, sunda, islands, coastal, new, guinea, and, island, melanesia, and, the, austronesian, engraving, style, aes, of, papua, new, guinea, and, island, melanesia, despite, proximity, these, traditions, can, be, distinguished, readily, from, the, australo, melanesian, rock, art, traditions, of, australia, except, the, torres, strait, islands, as, well, as, the, interior, highlands, of, new, guinea, indicating, the, borders, of, the, extent, of, the, austronesian, expansion, dating, rock, art, is, difficult, but, some, of, the, sites, subjected, to, direct, dating, pre, date, austronesian, arrival, like, the, lene, hara, paintings, of, east, timor, which, have, an, age, range, of, 6, 300, to, 26, 000, bp, conversely, others, are, more, recent, and, can, be, dated, indirectly, by, their, subjects, the, depictions, of, pottery, ships, and, metal, objects, for, example, put, certain, rock, art, sites, at, a, range, of, 2, 000, to, 4, 000, bp, some, hunter, gatherer, groups, have, also, continued, to, produce, rock, art, well, into, the, present, period, as, evidenced, by, their, modern, subjects, the, megalithic, culture, is, mostly, limited, to, western, island, southeast, asia, with, the, greatest, concentration, being, western, indonesia, while, most, sites, are, not, dated, the, age, ranges, of, dating, sites, are, between, the, 2nd, to, 16th, century, ce, they, are, divided, into, two, phases, the, first, is, an, older, megalithic, tradition, associated, with, the, neolithic, austronesian, rectangular, axe, culture, 2, 500, to, 1, 500, bce, while, the, second, is, the, 3rd, or, 4th, century, bce, megalithic, tradition, associated, with, the, non, austronesian, dong, son, culture, of, vietnam, prasetyo, 2006, suggests, that, the, megalithic, traditions, are, not, originally, austronesian, but, rather, innovations, acquired, through, trade, with, india, and, china, but, this, has, little, to, no, evidence, in, the, intervening, regions, in, thailand, vietnam, and, the, philippines, the, austronesian, painting, traditions, are, the, most, common, types, of, rock, art, in, island, southeast, asia, they, consist, of, scenes, and, pictograms, typically, found, in, rock, shelters, and, caves, near, coastal, areas, they, are, characteristically, rendered, in, red, ochre, pigments, for, the, earlier, forms, later, sometimes, superseded, by, paintings, done, in, black, charcoal, pigments, their, sites, are, mostly, clustered, in, eastern, indonesia, and, island, melanesia, although, a, few, examples, can, be, found, in, the, rest, of, island, southeast, asia, their, occurrence, has, a, high, correlation, to, austronesian, speaking, areas, further, evidenced, by, the, appearance, of, bronze, artifacts, in, the, paintings, they, are, mostly, found, near, the, coastlines, their, common, motifs, include, hand, stencils, sun, ray, designs, boats, and, active, human, figures, with, headdresses, or, weapons, and, other, paraphernalia, they, also, feature, geometric, motifs, similar, to, those, of, the, austronesian, engraving, style, some, paintings, are, also, associated, with, traces, of, human, burials, and, funerary, rites, including, ship, burials, the, representations, of, boats, themselves, are, believed, to, be, connected, to, the, widespread, ship, of, the, dead, austronesian, funerary, practices, the, earliest, apt, site, dated, is, from, vanuatu, and, was, found, to, be, around, 3, 000, bp, corresponding, to, the, initial, migration, wave, of, the, austronesians, these, early, sites, are, largely, characterized, by, face, motifs, and, hand, stencils, later, sites, from, 1, 500, bp, onwards, however, begin, to, show, regional, divergence, in, their, art, styles, apt, can, be, readily, distinguished, from, older, pleistocene, era, australo, melanesian, cave, paintings, by, their, motifs, color, and, composition, though, they, can, often, be, found, in, the, same, locality, the, most, recognizable, motifs, of, apt, like, boats, do, not, occur, in, cave, paintings, or, engravings, that, definitely, pre, date, the, austronesian, arrival, the, sole, exception, being, the, stenciled, hand, motif, some, apt, examples, are, also, characteristically, found, in, relatively, inaccessible, locations, including, very, high, up, in, cliffsides, overlooking, the, sea, no, traces, of, apt, have, been, found, in, taiwan, or, the, philippines, though, there, is, continuity, in, the, motifs, of, spirals, and, concentric, circles, found, in, ancestral, petroglyphs, aes, which, consists, of, petroglyphs, carved, into, rock, surfaces, is, far, less, common, than, apt, the, majority, of, these, sites, are, in, coastal, new, guinea, and, island, melanesia, aes, sites, which, can, be, tentatively, traced, back, to, the, similar, wanshan, petroglyphs, of, taiwan, are, believed, to, be, largely, correlated, to, the, prehistoric, extent, of, the, lapita, culture, the, common, motif, of, this, tradition, is, curvilinear, geometric, engravings, like, spirals, concentric, circles, and, face, like, forms, these, resemble, the, geometric, motifs, in, apt, though, they, are, considered, to, be, two, separate, artistic, traditions, aes, is, particularly, dominant, in, the, solomon, islands, and, new, caledonia, where, engravings, are, far, more, abundant, than, painted, sites, o, connor, et, al, 2015, proposes, that, apt, developed, during, the, initial, rapid, southward, austronesian, expansion, and, not, before, possibly, as, a, response, to, the, communication, challenges, brought, about, by, the, new, maritime, mode, of, living, along, with, aes, these, material, symbols, and, associated, rituals, and, technologies, may, have, been, manifestations, of, powerful, ideologies, spread, by, austronesian, settlers, that, were, central, to, the, neolithization, and, rapid, assimilation, of, the, various, non, austronesian, indigenous, populations, of, isea, and, melanesia, the, easternmost, islands, of, island, melanesia, vanuatu, fiji, and, new, caledonia, are, considered, part, of, remote, oceania, as, they, are, beyond, the, inter, island, visibility, threshold, these, island, groups, begin, to, show, divergence, from, the, apt, and, aes, traditions, of, near, oceania, while, their, art, traditions, show, a, clear, continuation, of, the, apt, and, aes, traditions, they, also, feature, innovations, unique, to, each, island, group, like, the, increasing, use, of, black, charcoal, rectilinear, motifs, and, being, more, commonly, found, inside, sacred, caves, rather, than, on, open, cliffsides, in, micronesia, the, rock, art, traditions, can, be, divided, into, three, general, regions, western, central, and, eastern, the, divisions, reflect, the, various, major, migration, waves, from, the, philippines, into, the, mariana, islands, and, palau, in, 3, 500, bp, a, lapita, culture, back, migration, from, island, melanesia, into, central, and, eastern, micronesia, around, 2, 200, bp, and, finally, a, back, migration, from, western, polynesia, into, eastern, micronesia, around, 1, 000, bp, in, western, micronesia, palau, yap, guam, and, the, northern, mariana, islands, rock, art, primarily, consists, of, paintings, on, high, cave, ceilings, and, sea, facing, cliffs, it, is, very, similar, to, apt, in, terms, of, its, motifs, as, well, as, its, placement, in, relatively, inaccessible, locations, common, motifs, include, hand, stencils, faces, turtles, and, fish, concentric, circles, and, characteristic, four, pointed, stars, petroglyphs, are, rare, and, mainly, consist, of, human, forms, with, triangular, bodies, without, heads, or, arms, this, is, believed, to, be, connected, to, the, funerary, rite, of, removing, the, heads, from, the, bodies, of, deceased, relatives, a, notable, megalithic, tradition, in, western, micronesia, are, the, haligi, stone, pillars, of, the, chamorro, people, these, are, capped, stone, pillars, that, are, believed, to, have, served, as, supports, for, raised, buildings, they, are, associated, with, the, latte, period, 900, to, 1700, ce, when, a, new, wave, of, migrants, from, southeast, asia, reintroduced, rice, cultivation, to, the, islands, another, megalithic, tradition, is, that, of, the, rai, stones, massive, doughnut, shaped, discs, of, rock, that, were, used, as, currency, on, yap, rock, art, in, central, micronesia, chuuk, pohnpei, and, kosrae, in, contrast, is, dominated, by, rock, engravings, with, motifs, tying, it, to, the, rock, art, traditions, of, island, melanesia, they, include, curvilinear, shapes, like, spirals, and, concentric, circles, tree, like, shapes, and, the, distinctive, enveloped, cross, motif, the, pohnpaid, petroglyphs, are, the, largest, assemblage, of, rock, engravings, in, the, region, with, motifs, dominated, by, footprints, enveloped, crosses, and, outlined, sword, paddles, central, micronesia, also, hosts, the, ruins, of, the, stone, cities, of, nan, madol, 1, 180, 1, 200, ce, and, leluh, 1, 200, 1, 800, ce, on, the, islands, of, pohnpei, and, kosrae, respectively, in, the, low, lying, atolls, of, eastern, micronesia, rock, art, is, rare, to, nonexistent, due, to, the, absence, of, suitable, rock, surfaces, for, painting, or, engraving, in, polynesia, rock, art, is, dominated, by, petroglyphs, rather, than, paintings, and, they, show, less, variation, than, the, rock, art, of, near, oceania, and, isea, in, the, western, polynesian, islands, nearest, to, island, melanesia, rock, art, is, rare, like, in, tonga, and, samoa, or, absent, entirely, like, in, the, cook, islands, however, petroglyphs, are, abundant, on, the, islands, in, the, further, reaches, of, the, polynesian, triangle, particularly, on, hawaii, the, marquesas, and, rapa, nui, rapa, nui, has, the, densest, concentration, of, engravings, in, polynesia, as, a, whole, while, the, pu, uloa, petroglyphs, site, on, hawaii, has, the, largest, number, of, petroglyphs, in, a, single, site, at, over, 21, 000, engravings, polynesia, also, features, megalithic, sacred, ceremonial, centres, generally, known, as, marae, on, tonga, and, samoa, the, existing, rock, art, sites, consist, mostly, of, engravings, with, motifs, including, curvilinear, shapes, human, figures, jellyfish, turtles, birds, and, footprints, these, are, typically, carved, in, natural, rock, formations, or, marae, sites, in, the, central, eastern, polynesian, islands, which, include, the, marquesas, and, the, society, islands, petroglyphs, are, more, numerous, they, show, the, archetypal, polynesian, motifs, of, turtles, faces, cup, like, depressions, cupules, stick, like, human, figures, boats, fish, curvilinear, shapes, and, concentric, circles, like, in, western, polynesia, they, are, typically, carved, into, marae, sites, or, in, rocks, beside, streams, the, existing, rock, paintings, also, display, the, same, motifs, but, are, rendered, in, different, styles, on, the, hawaiian, islands, the, abundant, petroglyphs, are, remarkably, all, similar, in, execution, their, common, subjects, include, stick, like, human, figures, dogs, boats, sails, paddles, footprints, and, ceremonial, headdresses, depictions, of, marine, life, however, are, rare, unlike, in, the, rest, of, polynesia, they, are, typically, carved, into, boulders, lava, rock, formations, and, cliffsides, red, paintings, of, dogs, on, cliffsides, and, caves, can, also, be, found, on, kau, ai, and, maui, the, megalithic, traditions, of, hawaii, can, be, exemplified, by, the, heiau, sacred, sites, which, can, range, from, simple, earth, terraces, to, standing, stones, on, rapa, nui, the, engravings, are, distinctive, but, still, show, similarities, to, the, techniques, and, motifs, of, the, marquesas, their, motifs, commonly, include, disembodied, parts, of, the, human, body, vulvae, in, particular, animals, plants, ceremonial, objects, and, boats, a, prominent, motif, is, also, that, of, the, birdman, figure, which, is, associated, with, the, tangata, manu, cult, of, makemake, the, best, known, rock, art, assemblage, of, rapa, nui, however, are, the, moai, megaliths, a, few, paintings, mostly, of, birds, and, boats, have, also, been, discovered, which, are, associated, with, the, engravings, rather, than, being, separate, artforms, the, rock, art, in, new, zealand, can, be, divided, into, two, regions, north, island, features, more, engravings, than, paintings, while, south, island, is, unique, in, that, it, is, the, only, polynesian, island, where, there, are, more, paintings, than, engravings, new, zealand, rock, paintings, are, done, in, red, and, black, pigments, and, can, sometimes, be, found, at, inaccessible, heights, they, typically, depict, human, figures, particularly, a, front, facing, human, figure, with, flexed, arms, birds, lizards, dogs, fish, and, what, has, been, identified, as, birdmen, engravings, in, open, spaces, like, cliffsides, are, generally, of, spirals, and, curvilinear, shapes, while, engravings, in, enclosed, caves, and, shelters, depict, faces, and, boats, the, same, motifs, can, also, be, seen, in, dendroglyphs, on, living, trees, body, art, among, austronesian, peoples, is, common, especially, elaborate, tattooing, which, is, one, of, the, most, well, known, pan, austronesian, traditions, in, modern, times, tattoos, are, usually, associated, with, polynesian, culture, due, to, the, highly, influential, accounts, of, james, cook, in, his, explorations, of, the, pacific, in, the, 18th, century, cook, introduced, the, word, tattoo, archaic, tattaow, tattow, into, the, english, vocabulary, from, tahitian, and, samoan, t, tau, to, tap, however, tattoos, existed, prominently, in, various, other, austronesian, groups, prior, to, contact, with, other, cultures, tattoos, had, various, functions, among, austronesian, societies, among, men, they, were, strongly, linked, to, the, widespread, practice, of, head, hunting, raids, in, head, hunting, societies, tattoos, were, records, of, how, many, heads, the, warrior, had, taken, in, battle, and, they, were, part, of, the, initiation, rites, into, adulthood, the, number, and, location, of, tattoos, therefore, were, indicative, of, a, warrior, s, status, and, prowess, among, the, indigenous, taiwanese, tattoos, were, present, for, both, men, and, women, among, the, tayal, facial, tattoos, were, dominant, they, indicated, maturity, and, skill, in, weaving, and, farming, for, women, and, skill, in, hunting, and, battle, for, men, as, in, most, of, austronesia, tattooing, traditions, in, taiwan, have, largely, disappeared, due, to, the, sinicization, of, native, peoples, after, the, chinese, colonization, of, the, island, in, the, 17th, century, as, well, as, conversion, to, christianity, most, of, the, remaining, tattoos, are, only, found, among, elders, one, of, the, earliest, descriptions, of, austronesian, tattoos, by, europeans, was, during, the, 16th, century, spanish, expeditions, to, the, philippines, beginning, with, the, first, voyage, of, circumnavigation, by, ferdinand, magellan, the, spanish, encountered, the, heavily, tattooed, visayan, people, in, the, visayas, islands, whom, they, named, the, pintados, spanish, for, the, painted, ones, however, philippine, tattooing, traditions, batok, have, mostly, been, lost, as, the, natives, of, the, islands, converted, to, christianity, and, islam, though, they, are, still, practiced, in, isolated, groups, in, the, highlands, of, luzon, and, mindanao, philippine, tattoos, were, usually, geometric, patterns, or, stylized, depictions, of, animals, plants, and, human, figures, some, of, the, few, remaining, traditional, tattoos, in, the, philippines, are, among, elders, of, the, igorot, peoples, most, of, these, were, records, of, war, exploits, against, the, japanese, during, world, war, ii, among, the, m, ori, of, new, zealand, tattoos, moko, were, originally, carved, into, the, skin, using, bone, chisels, uhi, rather, than, through, puncturing, as, in, usual, practice, in, addition, to, being, pigmented, the, skin, was, also, left, raised, into, ridges, of, swirling, patterns, teeth, blackening, was, the, custom, of, dyeing, one, s, teeth, black, with, various, tannin, rich, plant, dyes, it, was, practiced, throughout, almost, the, entire, range, of, austronesia, including, island, southeast, asia, madagascar, micronesia, and, island, melanesia, reaching, as, far, east, as, malaita, however, it, was, absent, in, polynesia, it, also, existed, in, non, austronesian, populations, in, mainland, southeast, asia, and, japan, the, practice, was, primarily, preventative, as, it, reduced, the, chances, of, developing, tooth, decay, similar, to, modern, dental, sealants, it, also, had, cultural, significance, and, was, seen, as, beautiful, a, common, sentiment, was, that, blackened, teeth, separated, humans, from, animals, teeth, blackening, was, often, done, in, conjunction, with, other, modifications, to, the, teeth, associated, with, beauty, standards, including, dental, evulsion, and, filing, the, religious, traditions, of, the, austronesian, people, focus, mostly, on, ancestral, spirits, nature, spirits, and, gods, making, it, a, complex, animistic, religion, mythologies, vary, by, culture, and, geographical, location, but, share, common, basic, aspects, such, as, ancestor, worship, animism, shamanism, and, the, belief, in, a, spirit, world, and, powerful, deities, there, is, also, a, great, amount, of, shared, mythology, and, a, common, belief, in, mana, many, of, these, beliefs, have, gradually, been, replaced, examples, of, native, religions, include, indigenous, philippine, folk, religions, including, beliefs, in, anito, sunda, wiwitan, kejawen, kaharingan, and, m, ori, religion, many, austronesian, religious, beliefs, have, been, incorporated, into, foreign, religions, such, as, hinduism, buddhism, christianity, and, islam, which, austronesian, peoples, were, introduced, to, later, with, the, possible, exception, of, rongorongo, on, rapa, nui, austronesians, did, not, have, an, indigenous, writing, system, but, rather, adopted, or, developed, writing, systems, after, contact, with, various, non, austronesian, cultures, there, existed, various, forms, of, symbolic, communication, using, pictograms, and, petroglyphs, but, these, did, not, encode, language, rongorongo, said, to, have, originally, been, called, kohau, motu, mo, rongorongo, lines, of, inscriptions, for, chanting, out, is, the, only, pre, contact, indigenous, austronesian, system, of, glyphs, that, appear, to, be, true, writing, or, at, least, proto, writing, they, consist, of, around, 120, glyphs, ranging, from, representations, of, plants, to, animals, celestial, objects, and, geometric, shapes, they, were, inscribed, into, wooden, tablets, about, 12, to, 20, in, 30, to, 51, cm, long, using, shark, teeth, and, obsidian, flakes, the, wood, allegedly, came, from, toromiro, and, mako, i, trees, which, is, notable, given, that, rapa, nui, was, completely, deforested, at, the, time, of, european, contact, of, the, surviving, two, dozen, tablets, a, few, were, made, from, trees, introduced, after, european, contact, as, well, as, wood, originating, from, european, ships, and, driftwood, rapa, nui, also, has, a, rich, assemblage, of, petroglyphs, largely, associated, with, the, tangata, manu, birdman, cult, of, makemake, although, some, rongorongo, glyphs, may, have, been, derived, from, these, petroglyphs, rongorongo, does, not, appear, in, any, of, the, abundant, rock, carvings, in, rapa, nui, and, seems, to, be, restricted, to, the, wooden, tablets, the, tablets, were, first, described, by, an, outsider, in, 1864, by, the, catholic, missionary, eug, ne, eyraud, who, said, they, were, found, in, all, the, houses, however, he, paid, them, little, attention, and, they, remained, unnoticed, by, the, outside, world, it, wasn, t, until, 1869, that, one, of, the, tablets, came, into, the, possession, of, florentin, tienne, jaussen, the, bishop, of, tahiti, he, brought, the, tablets, to, the, world, s, attention, and, instructed, the, rapa, nui, mission, to, gather, more, information, about, them, but, by, then, most, of, the, tablets, were, allegedly, already, destroyed, presumed, to, have, been, used, as, fuel, by, the, natives, on, the, deforested, island, at, the, time, of, discovery, of, the, tablets, rapa, nui, had, undergone, severe, depopulation, this, was, largely, due, to, the, loss, of, the, island, s, last, trees, and, the, peruvian, and, chilean, slave, raids, in, the, early, 1860s, the, literate, ruling, classes, of, the, rapa, nui, people, including, the, royal, family, and, the, religious, caste, and, the, majority, of, the, island, s, population, were, kidnapped, or, killed, in, the, slave, raids, most, of, those, taken, died, after, only, one, or, two, years, in, captivity, from, harsh, working, conditions, and, european, diseases, succeeding, epidemics, of, smallpox, and, tuberculosis, further, decimated, the, island, s, population, to, the, point, that, there, were, not, enough, people, to, bury, the, dead, the, last, remnants, of, the, rapa, nui, people, were, assimilated, by, the, tahitians, who, were, later, brought, to, the, island, in, an, effort, to, repopulate, it, further, resulting, in, the, loss, of, most, of, the, old, rapa, nui, language, oral, tradition, holds, that, the, ruling, classes, were, the, only, ones, who, could, read, the, tablets, and, the, ability, to, decipher, the, tablets, was, lost, along, with, them, numerous, attempts, have, been, made, to, read, the, tablets, starting, from, a, few, years, after, their, discovery, but, to, this, day, none, have, proven, successful, some, authors, have, proposed, that, rongorongo, may, have, been, an, attempt, to, imitate, european, script, after, the, idea, of, writing, was, introduced, during, the, signing, of, the, 1770, spanish, treaty, of, annexation, or, through, knowledge, of, european, writing, acquired, elsewhere, they, cite, various, reasons, including, the, lack, of, attestation, of, rongorongo, prior, to, the, 1860s, the, clearly, more, recent, provenance, of, some, of, the, tablets, the, lack, of, antecedents, and, the, lack, of, additional, archaeological, evidence, since, its, discovery, others, argue, that, it, was, merely, a, mnemonic, list, of, symbols, meant, to, guide, incantations, whether, rongorongo, is, merely, an, example, of, trans, cultural, diffusion, or, a, true, indigenous, austronesian, writing, system, and, one, of, the, few, independent, inventions, of, writing, in, human, history, remains, unknown, in, southeast, asia, the, first, true, writing, systems, of, pre, modern, austronesian, cultures, were, all, derived, from, the, grantha, and, pallava, brahmic, scripts, all, of, which, are, abugidas, from, south, india, various, forms, of, abugidas, spread, throughout, austronesian, cultures, in, southeast, asia, as, kingdoms, became, indianized, through, early, maritime, trading, the, oldest, use, of, abugida, scripts, in, austronesian, cultures, are, 4th, century, stone, inscriptions, written, in, cham, from, vietnam, there, are, numerous, other, brahmic, derived, writing, systems, among, southeast, asian, austronesians, usually, specific, to, a, certain, ethnic, group, notable, examples, include, balinese, batak, baybayin, buhid, hanun, o, javanese, kulitan, lontara, old, kawi, rejang, rencong, sundanese, and, tagbanwa, they, vary, from, having, letters, with, rounded, shapes, to, characters, with, sharp, cuneiform, like, angles, as, a, result, of, the, difference, in, writing, mediums, with, the, former, being, ideal, for, writing, on, soft, leaves, and, the, latter, on, bamboo, panels, the, use, of, the, scripts, ranged, from, mundane, records, to, encoding, esoteric, knowledge, on, magico, religious, rituals, and, folk, medicine, in, regions, that, converted, to, islam, abjads, derived, from, the, arabic, script, started, replacing, the, earlier, abugidas, at, around, the, 13th, century, in, southeast, asia, madagascar, adopted, the, arabic, script, in, the, 14th, century, abjads, however, have, an, even, greater, inherent, problem, with, encoding, austronesian, languages, than, abugidas, because, austronesian, languages, have, more, varied, and, salient, vowels, that, the, arabic, script, usually, cannot, encode, as, a, result, the, austronesian, adaptations, such, as, the, jawi, and, the, pegon, scripts, have, been, modified, with, a, system, of, diacritics, that, encode, sounds, both, vowels, and, consonants, native, to, austronesian, languages, but, absent, in, semitic, ones, with, the, advent, of, the, colonial, era, almost, all, of, these, writing, systems, have, been, replaced, with, alphabets, adapted, from, the, latin, as, in, the, hawaiian, filipino, and, malay, alphabet, however, several, formosan, languages, had, been, written, in, zhuyin, and, cia, cia, off, sulawesi, has, experimented, with, hangul, on, woleai, and, surrounding, islands, a, script, was, developed, for, the, woleaian, language, in, the, early, 20th, century, approximately, 20, of, the, script, s, letterforms, were, borrowed, from, latin, letters, the, remaining, characters, seem, to, have, been, derived, from, indigenous, iconography, despite, this, heavy, latin, influence, the, script, was, a, syllabary, vanuatu, has, a, unique, tradition, of, sand, drawing, in, which, images, are, created, by, a, single, continuous, line, drawn, in, the, sand, it, is, believed, to, have, functioned, as, a, means, of, symbolic, communication, in, pre, contact, island, melanesia, especially, between, travelers, and, ethnic, groups, that, do, not, speak, the, same, language, the, sand, drawings, consist, of, around, 300, different, designs, and, seem, to, be, shared, across, language, groups, in, the, 1990s, elements, of, the, drawings, were, adapted, into, a, modern, constructed, script, called, avoiuli, by, the, turaga, indigenous, movement, on, pentecost, island, genetic, studies, have, been, conducted, on, austronesian, peoples, haplogroup, o1a, marked, by, the, m119, snp, is, frequently, detected, in, native, taiwanese, and, people, of, the, northern, philippines, as, well, as, some, people, in, indonesia, malaysia, and, non, austronesian, populations, in, southern, china, a, 2007, analysis, of, the, dna, recovered, from, human, remains, in, archaeological, sites, of, prehistoric, peoples, along, the, yangtze, river, in, china, also, shows, high, frequencies, of, haplogroup, o1, in, the, neolithic, liangzhu, culture, linking, them, to, austronesian, and, tai, kadai, peoples, the, liangzhu, culture, existed, in, coastal, areas, around, the, mouth, of, the, yangtze, haplogroup, o1, was, absent, in, other, archaeological, sites, inland, the, authors, of, the, study, suggest, that, this, may, be, evidence, of, two, different, human, migration, routes, during, the, peopling, of, eastern, asia, one, coastal, and, the, other, inland, with, little, gene, flow, between, them, an, important, breakthrough, in, studies, in, austronesian, genetics, was, the, identification, of, the, polynesian, motif, haplogroup, b4a1a1, in, 1989, a, specific, nine, base, pair, deletion, mutation, in, mitochondrial, dna, several, studies, have, shown, that, it, is, shared, by, polynesians, and, island, southeast, asians, with, a, sub, branch, also, identified, in, madagascar, indicating, shared, maternal, ancestry, among, austronesians, austronesian, speaking, regions, also, have, high, to, moderate, frequencies, of, haplogroup, o1, of, the, y, dna, including, madagascar, indicating, shared, paternal, ancestry, with, the, exception, of, polynesia, where, the, papuan, derived, haplogroup, c2a1, predominates, although, lower, frequencies, of, austronesian, haplogroup, o, m122, also, exist, this, indicates, that, the, lapita, people, the, direct, ancestors, of, polynesians, were, likely, matrilocal, assimilating, papuan, men, from, outside, the, community, by, marriage, in, near, oceania, prior, to, the, polynesian, expansion, into, remote, oceania, moodley, et, al, 2009, identified, two, distinct, populations, of, the, gut, bacteria, helicobacter, pylori, that, accompanied, human, migrations, into, island, southeast, asia, and, oceania, called, hpsahul, and, hspm, ori, the, study, sampled, native, australians, native, taiwanese, highlanders, in, new, guinea, and, melanesians, and, polynesians, in, new, caledonia, which, were, then, compared, with, other, h, pylori, haplotypes, from, europeans, asians, pacific, islanders, and, others, they, found, that, hpsahul, diverged, from, mainland, asian, h, pylori, populations, approximately, 31, 000, to, 37, 000, years, ago, and, have, remained, isolated, for, 23, 000, to, 32, 000, years, confirming, the, australo, melanesian, substratum, in, island, southeast, asia, and, new, guinea, hspm, ori, on, the, other, hand, is, a, subpopulation, of, hpeastasia, previously, isolated, from, polynesians, m, ori, tongans, samoans, in, new, zealand, and, three, individuals, from, the, philippines, and, japan, the, study, found, hspm, ori, from, native, taiwanese, melanesians, polynesians, and, two, inhabitants, from, the, torres, strait, islands, all, of, which, are, austronesian, sources, as, expected, hspm, ori, showed, greatest, genetic, diversity, in, taiwan, while, all, non, taiwanese, hspm, ori, populations, belonged, to, a, single, lineage, they, called, the, pacific, clade, they, also, calculated, the, isolation, with, migration, model, ima, which, showed, that, the, divergence, of, the, pacific, clade, of, hspm, ori, was, unidirectional, from, taiwan, to, the, pacific, this, is, consistent, with, the, out, of, taiwan, model, of, austronesian, expansion, on, 16, january, 2020, the, personal, genomics, company, 23andme, added, the, category, filipino, austronesian, after, customers, with, no, known, filipino, ancestors, were, getting, false, positives, for, 5, or, more, filipino, ancestry, in, their, ancestry, composition, report, the, proportion, was, as, high, as, 75, in, samoa, 71, in, tonga, 68, in, guam, 18, in, hawaii, and, 34, in, madagascar, the, company, s, scientists, surmised, that, this, was, due, to, the, shared, austronesian, genetic, heritage, being, incorrectly, identified, as, filipino, ancestry, a, study, about, the, ancestral, composition, of, modern, ethnic, groups, in, the, philippines, from, 2021, similarly, suggests, that, distinctive, basal, east, asian, east, eurasian, ancestry, originated, in, mainland, southeast, asia, at, 50, 000, bce, and, expanded, through, multiple, migration, waves, southwards, and, northwards, respectively, basal, east, asian, ancestry, as, well, as, later, austroasiatic, ancestry, from, mainland, southeast, asia, arrived, into, the, philippines, prior, to, the, austronesian, expansion, austronesian, speakers, themselves, are, suggested, to, have, arrived, in, taiwan, and, the, northern, philippines, between, 10, 000, bce, to, 7, 000, bce, from, coastal, fujian, the, authors, concluded, that, the, austronesian, expansion, into, island, southeast, asia, and, polynesia, was, outgoing, from, the, philippines, rather, than, taiwan, and, that, modern, austronesian, speaking, people, mostly, have, ancestry, from, the, earliest, basal, east, asians, austroasiatic, migrants, from, mainland, southeast, asia, and, austronesian, speaking, seafarers, from, the, philippines, the, austronesian, migrations, were, accompanied, by, a, set, of, domesticated, semi, domesticated, and, commensal, plants, and, animals, transported, via, outrigger, ships, and, catamarans, that, enabled, early, austronesians, to, thrive, in, their, mostly, island, environments, these, include, crops, and, animals, believed, to, have, originated, from, the, hemudu, and, majiabang, cultures, in, the, hypothetical, pre, austronesian, homelands, in, mainland, china, as, well, as, other, plants, and, animals, believed, to, have, been, first, domesticated, from, within, taiwan, maritime, southeast, asia, and, new, guinea, some, of, these, plants, are, sometimes, also, known, as, canoe, plants, especially, in, the, context, of, polynesian, migrations, they, provide, another, source, of, evidence, for, austronesian, population, movements, notable, examples, of, these, crops, include, coconuts, bananas, rice, sugarcane, paper, mulberry, tapa, tree, breadfruit, taro, ube, areca, nut, including, the, practice, of, betel, chewing, ginger, turmeric, candlenut, pandan, and, citruses, the, cultivation, of, sweet, potatoes, in, polynesia, may, also, be, evidence, of, prehistoric, austronesian, contact, with, the, americas, though, this, remains, disputed, the, domesticated, animals, carried, in, austronesian, voyages, include, dogs, pigs, and, chickens, austronesians, also, introduced, these, crops, and, domesticated, animals, westward, via, trade, links, island, southeast, asians, established, spice, trade, links, with, the, dravidian, speaking, regions, in, sri, lanka, and, southern, india, by, around, 1500, to, 600, bce, these, early, contacts, resulted, in, the, introduction, of, austronesian, crops, and, material, culture, to, south, asia, including, betel, nut, chewing, coconuts, sandalwood, domesticated, bananas, sugarcane, cloves, and, nutmeg, south, asian, crops, like, the, mung, bean, and, horsegram, were, also, present, in, southeast, asia, by, 400, 100, bce, indicating, the, exchange, was, reciprocal, there, is, also, indirect, evidence, of, very, early, austronesian, contacts, with, africa, based, on, the, presence, and, spread, of, austronesian, domesticates, like, bananas, taro, chickens, and, purple, yam, in, africa, in, the, first, millennium, bce, a, genomic, analysis, in, 2020, showed, austronesian, contact, with, south, america, around, 1150, 1200, ce, the, earliest, one, being, between, fatu, hiva, and, colombia, africa, eurasia, north, america, oceania, south, america
