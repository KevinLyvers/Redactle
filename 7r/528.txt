battery, is, a, criminal, offense, involving, unlawful, physical, contact, distinct, from, assault, which, is, the, act, of, creating, apprehension, of, such, contact, battery, is, a, specific, common, law, offense, although, the, term, is, used, more, generally, to, refer, to, any, unlawful, offensive, physical, contact, with, another, person, battery, is, defined, by, american, common, law, as, any, unlawful, and, or, unwanted, touching, of, the, person, of, another, by, the, aggressor, or, by, a, substance, put, in, motion, by, them, in, more, severe, cases, and, for, all, types, in, some, jurisdictions, it, is, chiefly, defined, by, statutory, wording, assessment, of, the, severity, of, a, battery, is, determined, by, local, law, specific, rules, regarding, battery, vary, among, different, jurisdictions, but, some, elements, remain, constant, across, jurisdictions, battery, generally, requires, that, under, the, us, model, penal, code, and, in, some, jurisdictions, there, is, battery, when, the, actor, acts, recklessly, without, specific, intent, of, causing, an, offensive, contact, battery, is, typically, classified, as, either, simple, or, aggravated, although, battery, typically, occurs, in, the, context, of, physical, altercations, it, may, also, occur, under, other, circumstances, such, as, in, medical, cases, where, a, doctor, performs, a, non, consented, medical, procedure, battery, is, not, defined, in, the, canadian, criminal, code, instead, the, code, has, an, offense, of, assault, and, assault, causing, bodily, harm, battery, is, a, common, law, offence, within, england, and, wales, as, with, the, majority, of, offences, in, the, uk, it, has, two, elements, this, offence, is, a, crime, against, autonomy, with, more, violent, crimes, such, as, abh, and, gbh, being, statutory, offences, under, the, offences, against, the, person, act, 1861, as, such, even, the, slightest, of, touches, can, amount, to, an, unlawful, application, of, force, however, it, is, assumed, that, everyday, encounters, such, as, making, contact, with, others, on, public, transportation, are, consented, to, and, not, punishable, much, confusion, can, come, between, the, terms, assault, and, battery, in, everyday, use, the, term, assault, may, be, used, to, describe, a, physical, attack, which, is, indeed, a, battery, an, assault, is, causing, someone, to, apprehend, that, they, will, be, the, victim, of, a, battery, this, issue, is, so, prevalent, that, the, crime, of, sexual, assault, would, be, better, labelled, a, sexual, battery, this, confusion, stems, from, the, fact, that, both, assault, and, battery, can, be, referred, to, as, common, assault, in, practice, if, charged, with, such, an, offence, the, wording, will, read, assault, by, beating, but, this, means, the, same, as, battery, there, is, no, separate, offence, for, a, battery, relating, to, domestic, violence, however, the, introduction, of, the, crime, of, controlling, or, coercive, behaviour, in, an, intimate, or, family, relationship, in, section, 76, of, the, serious, crime, act, 2015, has, given, rise, to, new, sentencing, guidelines, that, take, into, account, significant, aggravating, factors, such, as, abuse, of, trust, resulting, in, potentially, longer, sentences, for, acts, of, battery, within, the, context, of, domestic, violence, in, dpp, v, taylor, dpp, v, little, it, was, held, that, battery, is, a, statutory, offence, contrary, to, section, 39, of, the, criminal, justice, act, 1988, this, decision, was, criticised, in, haystead, v, dpp, where, the, divisional, court, expressed, the, obiter, opinion, that, battery, remains, a, common, law, offence, therefore, whilst, it, may, be, a, better, view, that, battery, and, assault, have, statutory, penalties, rather, than, being, statutory, offences, it, is, still, the, case, that, until, review, by, a, higher, court, dpp, v, little, is, the, preferred, authority, in, england, and, wales, battery, is, a, summary, offence, under, section, 39, of, the, criminal, justice, act, 1988, however, by, virtue, of, section, 40, it, can, be, tried, on, indictment, where, another, indictable, offence, is, also, charged, which, is, founded, on, the, same, facts, or, together, with, which, it, forms, part, of, a, series, of, offences, of, similar, character, where, it, is, tried, on, indictment, a, crown, court, has, no, greater, powers, of, sentencing, than, a, magistrates, court, would, unless, the, battery, itself, constitutes, actual, bodily, harm, or, greater, it, is, punishable, with, imprisonment, for, a, term, not, exceeding, six, months, or, a, fine, not, exceeding, level, 5, on, the, standard, scale, or, both, there, are, numerous, defences, to, a, charge, of, assault, namely, for, provocation, see, tuberville, v, savage, there, is, an, offence, which, could, be, loosely, described, as, battery, in, russia, article, 116, of, the, russian, criminal, code, provides, that, battery, or, similar, violent, actions, which, cause, pain, are, an, offence, there, is, no, distinct, offence, of, battery, in, scotland, the, offence, of, assault, includes, acts, that, could, be, described, as, battery, in, the, united, states, criminal, battery, or, simple, battery, is, the, use, of, force, against, another, resulting, in, harmful, or, offensive, contact, including, sexual, contact, at, common, law, simple, battery, is, a, misdemeanor, the, prosecutor, must, prove, all, three, elements, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, the, common, law, elements, serve, as, a, basic, template, but, individual, jurisdictions, may, alter, them, and, they, may, vary, slightly, from, state, to, state, under, modern, statutory, schemes, battery, is, often, divided, into, grades, that, determine, the, severity, of, punishment, for, example, in, the, state, of, kansas, battery, is, defined, as, follows, the, law, on, battery, in, louisiana, reads, in, some, jurisdictions, battery, has, recently, been, constructed, to, include, directing, bodily, secretions, i, e, spitting, at, another, person, without, their, permission, some, of, those, jurisdictions, automatically, elevate, such, a, battery, to, the, charge, of, aggravated, battery, in, some, jurisdictions, the, charge, of, criminal, battery, also, requires, evidence, of, a, mental, state, mens, rea, the, terminology, used, to, refer, to, a, particular, offense, can, also, vary, by, jurisdiction, some, jurisdictions, such, as, new, york, refer, to, what, under, the, common, law, would, be, battery, as, assault, and, then, use, another, term, for, the, crime, that, would, have, been, assault, such, as, menacing, a, typical, overt, behavior, of, an, assault, is, person, a, chasing, person, b, and, swinging, a, fist, toward, their, head, that, for, battery, is, a, striking, b, battery, requires, assault, where, rooted, on, english, law, is, an, attempted, battery, or, the, act, of, intentionally, placing, a, person, in, apprehension, of, a, harmful, or, offensive, contact, with, their, person, elsewhere, it, is, often, similarly, worded, as, the, threat, of, violence, to, a, person, while, aggravated, assault, is, the, threat, with, the, clear, and, present, ability, and, willingness, to, carry, it, out, aggravated, battery, is, typically, offensive, touching, without, a, tool, or, weapon, with, attempt, to, harm, or, restrain
