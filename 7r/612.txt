represented, by, a, nominated, head, of, delegation, the, current, executive, supervisor, is, martin, sterdahl, who, took, over, the, role, from, jon, ola, sand, in, may, 2020, a, detailed, set, of, rules, is, written, by, the, ebu, for, each, contest, and, approved, by, the, reference, group, these, rules, have, changed, over, time, and, typically, outline, among, other, points, the, eligibility, of, the, competing, songs, the, format, of, the, contest, and, the, voting, system, to, be, used, to, determine, the, winner, and, how, the, results, will, be, presented, all, competing,

and, participating, broadcasters, are, free, to, decide, the, language, in, which, their, entry, may, be, performed, rules, specifying, in, which, language, a, song, may, be, performed, have, changed, over, time, no, restrictions, were, originally, enacted, when, the, contest, was, first, founded, however, following, criticism, over, the, 1965, swedish, entry, being, performed, in, english, a, new, rule, was, introduced, for, the, 1966, contest, restricting, songs, to, be, performed, only, in, an, official, language, of, the, country, it, represented, this, rule, was, first, abolished, in, 1973, and, subsequently, reinstated, for, most, countries, in, 1977, with, only, belgium, and, germany, permitted, freedom, of, language, as, their, selection, processes, for, that, year, s, contest, had, already, commenced, the, language, rule, was, once, again, abolished, ahead, of, the, 1999, contest, there, is, no, restriction, on, the, national, origin, country, of, residence, or, age, of, the, songwriter, s, furthermore, unlike, performers, who, may, only, represent, one, country, in, any, given, year, songwriters, are, free, to, enter, multiple, songs, in, a, single, year, sung, by, different, acts, for, example, in, the, 1980, edition, both, germany, s, and, luxembourg, s, entry, were, co, written, by, ralph, siegel, who, in, a, career, spanning, over, 40, years, was, involved, in, some, form, in, the, writing, of, dozens, of, entries, both, advancing, to, the, final, and, failing, to, make, it, past, the, national, selection, including, the, winning, entry, in, 1982, the, rules, for, the, first, contest, specified, that, only, solo, performers, were, permitted, to, enter, this, criterion, was, changed, the, following, year, to, permit, duos, to, compete, and, groups, were, subsequently, permitted, for, the, first, time, in, 1971, currently, the, number, of, people, permitted, on, stage, during, competing, performances, is, limited, to, a, maximum, of, six, and, no, live, animals, are, allowed, since, 1990, all, contestants, must, be, aged, 16, or, over, on, the, day, of, the, live, show, in, which, they, perform, sandra, kim, the, winner, in, 1986, at, the, age, of, 13, shall, remain, the, contest, s, youngest, winner, while, this, rule, remains, in, place, there, is, no, limit, on, the, nationality, or, country, of, birth, of, the, competing, artists, and, participating, broadcasters, are, free, to, select, an, artist, from, any, country, several, winning, artists, have, subsequently, held, a, different, nationality, or, were, born, in, a, different, country, to, that, which, they, represented, no, performer, may, compete, for, more, than, one, country, in, a, given, year, there, is, no, restriction, regarding, performers, who, have, participated, in, past, events, competing, again, whether, for, the, same, country, or, a, different, one, it, is, even, possible, for, a, winning, performer, to, try, and, defend, their, title, in, the, next, edition, as, happened, when, 2010, winner, lena, competed, again, in, 2011, however, in, the, history, of, the, contest, only, two, individuals, have, won, more, than, once, as, a, performer, johnny, logan, in, 1980, and, 1987, for, ireland, and, loreen, in, 2012, and, 2023, for, sweden, the, orchestra, was, a, prominent, aspect, of, the, contest, from, 1956, to, 1998, pre, recorded, backing, tracks, were, first, allowed, for, competing, acts, in, 1973, but, any, pre, recorded, instruments, were, required, to, be, seen, being, performed, on, stage, in, 1997, all, instrumental, music, was, allowed, to, be, pre, recorded, although, the, host, country, was, still, required, to, provide, an, orchestra, in, 1999, the, rules, were, changed, again, making, the, orchestra, an, optional, requirement, the, host, broadcaster, of, that, year, s, contest, israel, s, iba, subsequently, decided, not, to, provide, an, orchestra, resulting, in, all, entries, using, backing, tracks, for, the, first, time, currently, all, instrumental, music, for, competing, entries, must, now, be, pre, recorded, and, no, live, instrumentation, is, allowed, during, performances, the, main, vocals, of, competing, songs, must, be, performed, live, during, the, contest, previously, live, backing, vocals, were, also, required, since, 2021, these, may, optionally, be, pre, recorded, this, change, has, been, implemented, in, an, effort, to, introduce, flexibility, following, the, cancellation, of, the, 2020, edition, and, to, facilitate, modernisation, since, 2013, the, order, in, which, the, competing, countries, perform, has, been, determined, by, the, contest, s, producers, and, submitted, to, the, ebu, executive, supervisor, and, reference, group, for, approval, before, public, announcement, this, was, changed, from, a, random, draw, used, in, previous, years, in, order, to, provide, a, better, experience, for, television, viewers, and, ensure, all, countries, stand, out, by, avoiding, instances, where, songs, of, a, similar, style, or, tempo, are, performed, in, sequence, since, the, creation, of, a, second, semi, final, in, 2008, a, semi, final, allocation, draw, is, held, each, year, countries, are, placed, into, pots, based, on, their, geographical, location, and, voting, history, in, recent, contests, and, are, assigned, to, compete, in, one, of, the, two, semi, finals, through, a, random, draw, countries, are, then, randomly, assigned, to, compete, in, either, the, first, or, second, half, of, their, respective, semi, final, and, once, all, competing, songs, have, been, selected, the, producers, then, determine, the, running, order, for, the, semi, finals, the, automatic, qualifiers, are, assigned, at, random, to, a, semi, final, for, the, purposes, of, voting, rights, semi, final, qualifiers, make, a, draw, at, random, during, the, qualifiers, press, conference, to, determine, whether, they, will, perform, during, the, first, second, half, or, a, producer, determined, position, of, the, final, while, the, automatic, finalists, randomly, draw, their, competing, half, or, producer, determined, position, in, the, run, up, to, the, final, except, for, the, host, country, whose, exact, performance, position, is, determined, in, a, separate, draw, the, running, order, for, the, final, is, then, decided, following, the, second, semi, final, by, the, producers, the, running, orders, are, decided, with, the, competing, songs, musical, qualities, stage, performance, prop, and, lighting, set, up, and, other, production, considerations, taken, into, account, since, 2023, the, voting, system, used, to, determine, the, results, of, the, contest, has, worked, on, the, basis, of, positional, voting, each, country, awards, 1, 8, 10, and, 12, points, to, the, ten, favourite, songs, as, voted, for, by, that, country, s, general, public, or, assembled, jury, with, the, most, preferred, song, receiving, 12, points, in, the, semi, finals, each, country, awards, one, set, of, points, based, primarily, on, the, votes, cast, by, that, country, s, viewing, public, via, telephone, sms, or, the, official, eurovision, app, while, in, the, final, each, country, awards, two, sets, of, points, with, one, set, awarded, by, the, viewers, and, another, awarded, by, a, jury, panel, comprising, five, music, professionals, from, that, country, since, 2023, viewers, in, non, participating, countries, have, also, been, able, to, vote, during, the, contest, with, those, viewers, able, to, cast, votes, via, an, online, platform, which, are, then, aggregated, and, awarded, as, one, set, of, points, from, an, extra, country, for, the, overall, public, vote, this, system, is, a, modification, of, that, used, since, 1975, when, the, 12, points, system, was, first, introduced, but, with, one, set, of, points, per, country, and, a, similar, system, used, since, 2016, where, two, sets, of, points, were, awarded, in, both, the, semi, finals, and, final, national, juries, and, the, public, in, each, country, are, not, allowed, to, vote, for, their, own, country, a, rule, first, introduced, in, 1957, historically, each, country, s, points, were, determined, by, a, jury, consisting, at, various, times, of, members, of, the, public, music, professionals, or, both, in, combination, with, advances, in, telecommunication, technology, televoting, was, first, introduced, to, the, contest, in, 1997, on, a, trial, basis, with, broadcasters, in, five, countries, allowing, the, viewing, public, to, determine, their, votes, for, the, first, time, from, 1998, televoting, was, extended, to, almost, all, competing, countries, and, subsequently, became, mandatory, from, 2004, a, jury, was, reintroduced, for, the, final, in, 2009, with, each, country, s, points, comprising, both, the, votes, of, the, jury, and, public, in, an, equal, split, this, mix, of, jury, and, public, voting, was, expanded, into, the, semi, finals, from, 2010, and, was, used, until, 2023, when, full, public, voting, was, reintroduced, to, determine, the, results, of, the, semi, finals, the, mix, of, jury, and, public, voting, continues, to, be, used, in, the, final, should, two, or, more, countries, finish, with, the, same, number, of, points, a, tie, break, procedure, is, employed, to, determine, the, final, placings, as, of, 2016, a, combined, national, televoting, and, jury, result, is, calculated, for, each, country, and, the, country, which, has, obtained, more, points, from, the, public, voting, following, this, calculation, is, deemed, to, have, placed, higher, since, 1957, each, country, s, votes, have, been, announced, during, a, special, voting, segment, as, part, of, the, contest, s, broadcast, with, a, selected, spokesperson, assigned, to, announce, the, results, of, their, country, s, vote, this, spokesperson, is, typically, well, known, in, their, country, previous,

historically, placed, at, the, side, of, the, stage, and, updated, manually, as, each, country, gave, their, votes, in, 1988, a, computer, graphics, scoreboard, was, introduced, the, jury, points, from, 1, 8, and, 10, are, displayed, on, screen, and, added, automatically, to, the, scoreboard, then, the, country, s, spokesperson, announces, which, country, will, receive, the, 12, points, once,

exceptional, circumstances, such, as, due, to, developing, emergency, situations, participating, broadcasters, may, delay, or, postpone, broadcast, of, the, event, should, a, broadcaster, fail, to, air, a, show, as, expected, in, any, other, scenario, they, may, be, subject, to, sanctions, by, the, ebu, several, broadcasters, in, countries, that, are, unable, to, compete, have, previously, aired, the, contest, in, their, markets, as, national, broadcasters, join, and, leave, the, eurovision, feed, transmitted, by, the, ebu, the, ebu, eurovision, network, logo, ident, not, to, be, confused, with, the, logo, of, the, song, contest, itself, is, displayed, the, accompanying, music, used, on, other, eurovision, broadcasts, is, the, prelude, marche, en, rondeau, to, marc, antoine, charpentier, s, te, deum, originally, the, same, logo, was, used, for, both, the, eurovision, network, and, the, european, broadcasting, union, but, they, now, have, two, different, logos, the, latest, eurovision, network, logo, was, introduced, in, 2012, and, when, the, ident, is, transmitted, at, the, start, and, end, of, programmes, it, is, this, eurovision, network, logo, that, appears, the, ebu, now, holds, the, recordings, of, all, but, two, editions, of, the, contest, in, its, archives, following, a, project, initiated, in, 2011, to, collate, footage, and, related, materials, of, all, editions, ahead, of, the, event, s, 60th, edition, in, 2015, although, cameras, were, present, to, practice, pan, european, broadcasting, for, the, first, contest, in, 1956, to, the, few, europeans, who, had, television, sets, its, audience, was, primarily, over, the, radio, the, only, footage, available, is, a, kinescope, recording, of, lys, assia, s, reprise, of, her, winning, song, no, full, recording, of, the, 1964, contest, exists, with, conflicting, reports, of, the, fate, of, any, copies, that, may, have, survived, audio, recordings, of, both, contests, do, however, exist, and, some, short, pieces, of, footage, from, both, events, have, survived, until, 2004, the, host, broadcaster, owned, the, copyright, of, the, contest, that, they, produced, with, the, ebu, owning, the, copyright, of, all, subsequent, editions, from, the, original, seven, countries, which, entered, the, first, contest, in, 1956, the, number, of, competing, countries, has, steadily, grown, over, time, 18, countries, participated, in, the, contest, s, tenth, edition, in, 1965, and, by, 1990, 22, countries, were, regularly, competing, each, year, besides, slight, modifications, to, the, voting, system, and, other, contest, rules, no, fundamental, changes, to, the, contest, s, format, were, introduced, until, the, early, 1990s, when, events, in, europe, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, led, to, the, breakup, of, yugoslavia, with, the, subsequent, admission, into, the, ebu, of, the, broadcasters, of, the, countries, that, emerged, from, the, breakup, and, to, the, merger, in, 1993, of, the, ebu, with, its, eastern, european, counterpart, the, international, radio, and, television, organisation, oirt, which, further, expanded, the, number, of, broadcasters, by, including, those, from, countries, of, the, former, eastern, bloc, these, events, impacted, the, contest, as, they, expanded, the, number, of, broadcasters, eligible, to, participate, with, those, from, new, countries, 29, countries, registered, to, take, part, in, the, 1993, contest, a, figure, the, ebu, considered, unable, to, fit, reasonably, into, a, single, tv, show, a, pre, selection, method, was, subsequently, introduced, for, the, first, time, in, order, to, reduce, the, number, of, competing, entries, with, seven, countries, in, central, and, eastern, europe, participating, in, kvalifikacija, za, millstreet, held, in, ljubljana, slovenia, one, month, before, the, event, following, a, vote, amongst, the, seven, competing, countries, bosnia, and, herzegovina, croatia, and, slovenia, were, chosen, to, head, to, the, contest, in, millstreet, ireland, whilst, estonia, hungary, romania, and, slovakia, were, forced, to, wait, another, year, before, being, allowed, to, compete, a, new, relegation, system, was, introduced, for, entry, into, the, 1994, contest, with, the, lowest, placed, countries, being, forced, to, sit, out, the, following, year, s, event, to, be, replaced, by, countries, which, had, not, competed, in, the, previous, contest, the, bottom, seven, countries, in, 1993, were, required, to, miss, the, following, year, s, contest, and, were, replaced, by, the, four, unsuccessful, countries, in, kvalifikacija, za, millstreet, and, new, entries, from, lithuania, poland, and, russia, this, system, was, used, again, in, 1994, for, qualification, for, the, 1995, contest, but, a, new, system, was, introduced, for, the, 1996, contest, when, an, audio, only, qualification, round, was, held, in, the, months, before, the, contest, in, oslo, norway, this, system, was, primarily, introduced, in, an, attempt, to, appease, germany, one, of, eurovision, s, biggest, markets, and, financial, contributors, which, would, have, otherwise, been, relegated, under, the, previous, system, 29, countries, competed, for, 22, places, in, the, main, contest, alongside, the, automatically, qualified, norwegian, hosts, however, germany, would, ultimately, still, miss, out, and, joined, hungary, romania, russia, denmark, israel, and, macedonia, as, one, of, the, seven, countries, to, be, absent, from, the, oslo, contest, as, of, 2024, this, is, the, only, esc, germany, has, not, participated, in, for, the, 1997, contest, a, similar, relegation, system, to, that, used, between, 1993, and, 1995, was, introduced, with, each, country, s, average, scores, in, the, preceding, five, contests, being, used, as, a, measure, to, determine, which, countries, would, be, relegated, this, was, subsequently, changed, again, in, 2001, back, to, the, same, system, used, between, 1993, and, 1995, where, only, the, results, from, that, year, s, contest, would, count, towards, relegation, in, 1999, an, exemption, from, relegation, was, introduced, for, france, germany, spain, and, the, united, kingdom, giving, them, an, automatic, right, to, compete, in, the, 2000, contest, and, in, all, subsequent, editions, this, group, as, the, highest, paying, ebu, members, which, significantly, fund, the, contest, each, year, subsequently, became, known, as, the, big, four, countries, this, group, was, expanded, in, 2011, when, italy, began, competing, again, becoming, the, big, five, originally, brought, in, to, ensure, that, the, financial, contributions, of, the, contest, s, biggest, financial, backers, would, not, be, missed, since, the, introduction, of, the, semi, finals, in, 2004, the, big, five, now, instead, automatically, qualify, for, the, final, along, with, the, host, country, there, remains, debate, on, whether, this, status, prejudices, the, countries, results, based, on, reported, antipathy, over, their, automatic, qualification, and, the, potential, disadvantage, of, having, spent, less, time, on, stage, through, not, competing, in, the, semi, finals, however, this, status, appears, to, be, more, complex, given, that, the, results, of, the, big, five, countries, can, vary, widely, this, status, has, caused, consternation, from, other, competing, countries, and, was, cited, among, other, aspects, as, a, reason, why, turkey, had, ceased, participating, after, 2012, an, influx, of, new, countries, applying, for, the, 2003, contest, resulted, in, the, introduction, of, a, semi, final, from, 2004, with, the, contest, becoming, a, two, day, event, the, top, 10, countries, in, each, year, s, final, would, qualify, automatically, to, the, following, year, s, final, alongside, the, big, four, meaning, all, other, countries, would, compete, in, the, semi, final, to, compete, for, 10, qualification, spots, the, 2004, contest, in, istanbul, turkey, saw, a, record, 36, countries, competing, with, new, entries, from, albania, andorra, belarus, and, serbia, and, montenegro, and, the, return, of, previously, relegated, countries, the, format, of, this, semi, final, remained, similar, to, the, final, proper, taking, place, a, few, days, before, the, final, following, the, performances, and, the, voting, window, the, names, of, the, 10, countries, with, the, highest, number, of, points, which, would, therefore, qualify, for, the, final, were, announced, at, the, end, of, the, show, revealed, in, a, random, order, by, the, contest, s, presenters, the, single, semi, final, continued, to, be, held, between, 2005, and, 2007, however, with, 42, countries, competing, in, the, 2007, contest, in, helsinki, finland, the, semi, final, had, 28, entries, competing, for, 10, spots, in, the, final, following, criticism, over, the, mainly, central, and, eastern, european, qualifiers, at, the, 2007, event, and, the, poor, performance, of, entries, from, western, european, countries, a, second, semi, final, was, subsequently, introduced, for, the, 2008, contest, in, belgrade, serbia, with, all, countries, now, competing, in, one, of, the, two, semi, finals, with, only, the, host, country, and, the, big, four, and, subsequently, the, big, five, from, 2011, qualifying, automatically, 10, qualification, spots, would, be, available, in, each, of, the, semi, finals, and, a, new, system, to, split, the, competing, countries, between, the, two, semi, finals, was, introduced, based, on, their, geographic, location, and, previous, voting, patterns, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, the, impact, of, bloc, voting, and, to, make, the, outcome, less, predictable, the,

having, become, a, common, sight, at, recent, contests, criticism, of, these, tactics, have, been, levied, as, being, a, method, of, distracting, the, viewer, from, the, weak, musical, quality, of, some, of, the, competing, entries, while, many, of, these, traits, are, ridiculed, in, the, media, and, elsewhere, for, others, these, traits, are, celebrated, and, considered, an, integral, part, of,

quickly, since, both, countries, began, competing, in, the, late, 2000s, resulting, in, fines, and, disciplinary, action, for, both, countries, broadcasters, over, political, stunts, and, a, forced, change, of, title, for, one, competing, song, due, to, allegations, of, political, subtext, interactions, between, russia, and, ukraine, in, the, contest, had, originally, been, positive, but, as,

1944, whose, lyrics, referenced, the, deportation, of, the, crimean, tatars, but, which, the, russian, delegation, claimed, had, a, greater, political, meaning, in, light, of, russia, s, annexation,

participation, in, the, contest, has, resulted, in, several, controversial, moments, in, the, past, with, the, country, s, first, appearance, in, 1973, less, than, a, year, after, the, munich, massacre, resulting, in, an, increased, security, presence, at, the, venue, in, luxembourg, city, israel, s, first, win, in, 1978, proved, controversial, for, arab, states, broadcasting, the, contest, which, would, typically, cut, to, advertisements, when, israel, performed, due, to, a, lack, of, recognition, of, the, country, and, when, it, became, apparent, israel, would, win, many, of, these,

by, those, who, oppose, current, government, policies, in, the, state, with, calls, raised, by, various, political, groups, for, a, boycott, ahead, of, the, 2019, contest, in, tel, aviv, including, proponents, of, the, boycott, divestment, and, sanctions, bds, movement, in, response, to, the, country, s, policies, towards, palestinians, in, the, west, bank, and, gaza, as, well, as, groups, who, take, issue, with, perceived, pinkwashing, in, israel, others, campaigned, against, a, boycott, asserting, that, any, cultural, boycott, would, be, antithetical, to, advancing, peace, in, the, region, israel, s, participation, in, the, contest, was, again, put, into, question, following, the, outbreak, of, the, israel, hamas, war, in, october, 2023, with, renewed, calls, for, the, nation, s, exclusion, ahead, of, the, 2024, event, israel, s, entry, for, that, year, s, contest, was, however, accepted, by, the, ebu, although, it, was, required, to, undergo, rewrites, as, the, ebu, objected, to, the, political, nature, of, the, original, lyrics, which, made, reference, to, the, 7, october, attacks, on, israel, by, hamas, led, palestinian, militants, the, contest, has, been, described, as, containing, political, elements, in, its, voting, process, a, perception, that, countries, will, give, votes, more, frequently, and, in, higher, quantities, to, other, countries, based, on, political, relationships, rather, than, the, musical, merits, of, the, songs, themselves, numerous, studies, and, academic, papers, have, been, written, on, this, subject, which, have, corroborated, that, certain, countries, form, clusters, or, cliques, by, frequently, voting, in, the, same, way, one, study, concludes, that, voting, blocs, can, play, a, crucial, role, in, deciding, the, winner, of, the, contest, with, evidence, that, on, at, least, two, occasions, bloc, voting, was, a, pivotal, factor, in, the, vote, for, the, winning, song, other, views, on, these, blocs, argue, that, certain, countries, will, allocate, high, points, to, others, based, on, similar, musical, tastes, shared, cultural, links, and, a, high, degree, of, similarity, and, mutual, intelligibility, between, languages, and, are, therefore, more, likely, to, appreciate, and, vote, for, the, competing, songs, from, these, countries, based, on, these, factors, rather, than, political, relationships, specifically, analysis, on, other, voting, patterns, have, revealed, examples, which, indicate, voting, preferences, among, countries, based, on, shared, religion, as, well, as, patriotic, voting,

publishers, including, the, economist, the, times, and, bbc, news, criticism, of, the, voting, system, was, at, its, highest, in, the, mid, 2000s, resulting, in, a, number, of, calls, for, countries, to, boycott, the, contest, over, reported, voting, biases, particularly, following, the, 2007, contest, where, eastern, european, countries, occupied, the, top, 15, places, in, the, final, and, dominated, the, qualifying, spaces, the, poor, performance, of, the, entries, from, more, traditional, eurovision, countries, had, subsequently, been, discussed, in, european, national, parliaments, and, the, developments, in, the, voting, was, cited, as, among, the, reasons, for, the, resignation, of, terry, wogan, as, commentator, for, the, uk, a, role, he, had, performed, at, every, contest, from, 1980, in, response, to, this, criticism, the, ebu, introduced, a, second, semi, final, in, 2008, with, countries, split, based, on, geographic, proximity, and, voting, history, and, juries, of,
