in, grammar, a, phrase, called, expression, in, some, contexts, is, a, group, of, words, or, singular, word, acting, as, a, grammatical, unit, for, instance, the, english, expression, the, very, happy, squirrel, is, a, noun, phrase, which, contains, the, adjective, phrase, very, happy, phrases, can, consist, of, a, single, word, or, a, complete, sentence, in, theoretical, linguistics, phrases, are, often, analyzed, as, units, of, syntactic, structure, such, as, a, constituent, there, is, a, difference, between, the, common, use, of, the, term, phrase, and, its, technical, use, in, linguistics, in, common, usage, a, phrase, is, usually, a, group, of, words, with, some, special, idiomatic, meaning, or, other, significance, such, as, all, rights, reserved, economical, with, the, truth, kick, the, bucket, and, the, like, it, may, be, a, euphemism, a, saying, or, proverb, a, fixed, expression, a, figure, of, speech, etc, in, linguistics, these, are, known, as, phrasemes, in, theories, of, syntax, a, phrase, is, any, group, of, words, or, sometimes, a, single, word, which, plays, a, particular, role, within, the, syntactic, structure, of, a, sentence, it, does, not, have, to, have, any, special, meaning, or, significance, or, even, exist, anywhere, outside, of, the, sentence, being, analyzed, but, it, must, function, there, as, a, complete, grammatical, unit, for, example, in, the, sentence, yesterday, i, saw, an, orange, bird, with, a, white, neck, the, words, an, orange, bird, with, a, white, neck, form, a, noun, phrase, or, a, determiner, phrase, in, some, theories, which, functions, as, the, object, of, the, sentence, many, theories, of, syntax, and, grammar, illustrate, sentence, structure, using, phrase, trees, which, provide, schematics, of, how, the, words, in, a, sentence, are, grouped, and, relate, to, each, other, a, tree, shows, the, words, phrases, and, clauses, that, make, up, a, sentence, any, word, combination, that, corresponds, to, a, complete, subtree, can, be, seen, as, a, phrase, there, are, two, competing, principles, for, constructing, trees, they, produce, constituency, and, dependency, trees, and, both, are, illustrated, here, using, an, example, sentence, the, constituency, based, tree, is, on, the, left, and, the, dependency, based, tree, is, on, the, right, the, tree, on, the, left, is, of, the, constituency, based, phrase, structure, grammar, and, the, tree, on, the, right, is, of, the, dependency, grammar, the, node, labels, in, the, two, trees, mark, the, syntactic, category, of, the, different, constituents, or, word, elements, of, the, sentence, in, the, constituency, tree, each, phrase, is, marked, by, a, phrasal, node, np, pp, vp, and, there, are, eight, phrases, identified, by, phrase, structure, analysis, in, the, example, sentence, on, the, other, hand, the, dependency, tree, identifies, a, phrase, by, any, node, that, exerts, dependency, upon, or, dominates, another, node, and, using, dependency, analysis, there, are, six, phrases, in, the, sentence, the, trees, and, phrase, counts, demonstrate, that, different, theories, of, syntax, differ, in, the, word, combinations, they, qualify, as, a, phrase, here, the, constituency, tree, identifies, three, phrases, that, the, dependency, trees, does, not, namely, house, at, the, end, of, the, street, end, of, the, street, and, the, end, more, analysis, including, about, the, plausibilities, of, both, grammars, can, be, made, empirically, by, applying, constituency, tests, in, grammatical, analysis, most, phrases, contain, a, head, which, identifies, the, type, and, linguistic, features, of, the, phrase, the, syntactic, category, of, the, head, is, used, to, name, the, category, of, the, phrase, for, example, a, phrase, whose, head, is, a, noun, is, called, a, noun, phrase, the, remaining, words, in, a, phrase, are, called, the, dependents, of, the, head, in, the, following, phrases, the, head, word, or, head, is, bolded, the, above, five, examples, are, the, most, common, of, phrase, types, but, by, the, logic, of, heads, and, dependents, others, can, be, routinely, produced, for, instance, the, subordinator, phrase, by, linguistic, analysis, this, is, a, group, of, words, that, qualifies, as, a, phrase, and, the, head, word, gives, its, syntactic, name, subordinator, to, the, grammatical, category, of, the, entire, phrase, but, this, phrase, before, that, happened, is, more, commonly, classified, in, other, grammars, including, traditional, english, grammars, as, a, subordinate, clause, or, dependent, clause, and, it, is, then, labelled, not, as, a, phrase, but, as, a, clause, most, theories, of, syntax, view, most, phrases, as, having, a, head, but, some, non, headed, phrases, are, acknowledged, a, phrase, lacking, a, head, is, known, as, exocentric, and, phrases, with, heads, are, endocentric, some, modern, theories, of, syntax, introduce, functional, categories, in, which, the, head, of, a, phrase, is, a, functional, lexical, item, some, functional, heads, in, some, languages, are, not, pronounced, but, are, rather, covert, for, example, in, order, to, explain, certain, syntactic, patterns, which, correlate, with, the, speech, act, a, sentence, performs, some, researchers, have, posited, force, phrases, forcep, whose, heads, are, not, pronounced, in, many, languages, including, english, similarly, many, frameworks, assume, that, covert, determiners, are, present, in, bare, noun, phrases, such, as, proper, names, another, type, is, the, inflectional, phrase, where, for, example, a, finite, verb, phrase, is, taken, to, be, the, complement, of, a, functional, possibly, covert, head, denoted, infl, which, is, supposed, to, encode, the, requirements, for, the, verb, to, inflect, for, agreement, with, its, subject, which, is, the, specifier, of, infl, for, tense, and, aspect, etc, if, these, factors, are, treated, separately, then, more, specific, categories, may, be, considered, tense, phrase, tp, where, the, verb, phrase, is, the, complement, of, an, abstract, tense, element, aspect, phrase, agreement, phrase, and, so, on, further, examples, of, such, proposed, categories, include, topic, phrase, and, focus, phrase, which, are, argued, to, be, headed, by, elements, that, encode, the, need, for, a, constituent, of, the, sentence, to, be, marked, as, the, topic, or, focus, theories, of, syntax, differ, in, what, they, regard, as, a, phrase, for, instance, while, most, if, not, all, theories, of, syntax, acknowledge, the, existence, of, verb, phrases, vps, phrase, structure, grammars, acknowledge, both, finite, verb, phrases, and, non, finite, verb, phrases, while, dependency, grammars, only, acknowledge, non, finite, verb, phrases, the, split, between, these, views, persists, due, to, conflicting, results, from, the, standard, empirical, diagnostics, of, phrasehood, such, as, constituency, tests, the, distinction, is, illustrated, with, the, following, examples, the, syntax, trees, of, this, sentence, are, next, the, constituency, tree, on, the, left, shows, the, finite, verb, string, may, nominate, newt, as, a, constituent, it, corresponds, to, vp, 1, in, contrast, this, same, string, is, not, shown, as, a, phrase, in, the, dependency, tree, on, the, right, however, both, trees, take, the, non, finite, vp, string, nominate, newt, to, be, a, constituent
