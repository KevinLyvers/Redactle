human, overpopulation, or, human, population, overshoot, is, the, idea, that, human, populations, may, become, too, large, to, be, sustained, by, their, environment, or, resources, in, the, long, term, the, topic, is, usually, discussed, in, the, context, of, world, population, though, it, may, concern, individual, nations, regions, and, cities, since, 1804, the, global, living, human, population, has, increased, from, 1, billion, to, 8, billion, due, to, medical, advancements, and, improved, agricultural, productivity, annual, world, population, growth, peaked, at, 2, 1, in, 1968, and, has, since, dropped, to, 1, 1, according, to, the, most, recent, united, nations, projections, the, global, human, population, is, expected, to, reach, 9, 7, billion, in, 2050, and, would, peak, at, around, 10, 4, billion, people, in, the, 2080s, before, decreasing, noting, that, fertility, rates, are, falling, worldwide, 14, 30, other, models, agree, that, the, population, will, stabilize, before, or, after, 2100, conversely, other, researchers, have, found, that, national, birth, registries, data, from, 2022, and, 2023, that, cover, half, the, world, s, population, indicate, that, the, 2022, un, projections, overestimated, fertility, rates, by, 10, to, 20, and, are, already, outdated, that, the, global, fertility, rate, has, possibly, already, fallen, below, the, sub, replacement, fertility, level, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, and, that, the, global, population, will, peak, at, approximately, 9, 5, billion, by, 2061, the, 2024, un, projections, report, estimated, that, world, population, would, peak, at, 10, 29, billion, in, 2084, and, decline, to, 10, 18, billion, by, 2100, which, was, 6, lower, than, the, un, had, estimated, in, 2014, early, discussions, of, overpopulation, in, english, were, spurred, by, the, work, of, thomas, malthus, discussions, of, overpopulation, follow, a, similar, line, of, inquiry, as, malthusianism, and, its, malthusian, catastrophe, a, hypothetical, event, where, population, exceeds, agricultural, capacity, causing, famine, or, war, over, resources, resulting, in, poverty, and, depopulation, more, recent, discussion, of, overpopulation, was, popularized, by, paul, ehrlich, in, his, 1968, book, the, population, bomb, and, subsequent, writings, ehrlich, described, overpopulation, as, a, function, of, overconsumption, arguing, that, overpopulation, should, be, defined, by, a, population, being, unable, to, sustain, itself, without, depleting, non, renewable, resources, the, belief, that, global, population, levels, will, become, too, large, to, sustain, is, a, point, of, contentious, debate, those, who, believe, global, human, overpopulation, to, be, a, valid, concern, argue, that, increased, levels, of, resource, consumption, and, pollution, exceed, the, environment, s, carrying, capacity, leading, to, population, overshoot, the, population, overshoot, hypothesis, is, often, discussed, in, relation, to, other, population, concerns, such, as, population, momentum, biodiversity, loss, hunger, and, malnutrition, resource, depletion, and, the, overall, human, impact, on, the, environment, critics, of, the, belief, note, that, human, population, growth, is, decreasing, and, the, population, will, likely, peak, and, possibly, even, begin, to, decrease, before, the, end, of, the, century, 27, they, argue, the, concerns, surrounding, population, growth, are, overstated, noting, that, quickly, declining, birth, rates, and, technological, innovation, make, it, possible, to, sustain, projected, population, sizes, other, critics, claim, that, overpopulation, concerns, ignore, more, pressing, issues, like, poverty, or, overconsumption, are, motivated, by, racism, or, place, an, undue, burden, on, the, global, south, where, most, population, growth, happens, modern, proponents, of, the, concept, have, suggested, that, overpopulation, population, growth, and, overconsumption, are, interdependent, and, collectively, are, the, primary, drivers, of, human, caused, environmental, problems, such, as, climate, change, and, biodiversity, loss, many, scientists, have, expressed, concern, about, population, growth, and, argue, that, creating, sustainable, societies, will, require, decreasing, the, current, global, population, advocates, have, suggested, implementation, of, population, planning, strategies, to, reach, a, proposed, sustainable, population, overpopulation, hypotheses, are, controversial, with, many, demographers, and, environmentalists, disputing, the, core, premise, that, the, world, cannot, sustain, the, current, trajectory, of, human, population, additionally, many, economists, and, historians, have, noted, that, sustained, shortages, and, famines, have, historically, been, caused, by, war, price, controls, political, instability, and, repressive, political, regimes, often, employing, central, planning, rather, than, overpopulation, and, that, population, growth, historically, has, led, to, greater, technological, development, and, advancement, of, scientific, knowledge, that, has, enabled, the, engineering, of, substitute, goods, and, technology, that, better, conserves, and, more, efficiently, uses, natural, resources, produces, greater, agricultural, output, with, less, land, and, less, water, and, addresses, human, impacts, on, the, environment, due, to, there, being, greater, numbers, of, scientists, engineers, and, inventors, and, subsequent, generations, of, scientists, overturning, scientific, paradigms, maintained, by, previous, generations, of, scientists, instead, social, scientists, argue, that, disputes, between, themselves, and, biologists, about, human, overpopulation, are, over, the, appropriateness, of, definitions, being, used, and, often, devolve, into, social, scientists, and, biologists, simply, talking, past, each, other, annual, world, population, growth, peaked, at, 2, 1, in, 1968, has, since, dropped, to, 1, 1, and, could, drop, even, further, to, 0, 1, by, 2100, based, on, this, the, united, nations, projects, the, world, population, which, is, 7, 8, billion, as, of, 2020, to, level, out, around, 2100, at, 10, 9, billion, with, other, models, proposing, similar, stabilization, before, or, after, 2100, some, experts, believe, that, a, combination, of, factors, including, technological, and, social, change, would, allow, global, resources, to, meet, this, increased, demand, avoiding, global, overpopulation, additionally, some, critics, dismiss, the, idea, of, human, overpopulation, as, a, science, myth, connected, to, attempts, to, blame, environmental, issues, on, overpopulation, oversimplify, complex, social, or, economic, systems, or, place, blame, on, developing, countries, and, poor, populations, reinscribing, colonial, or, racist, assumptions, and, leading, to, discriminatory, policy, these, critics, often, suggest, overconsumption, should, be, treated, as, an, issue, separate, from, population, growth, world, population, has, been, rising, continuously, since, the, end, of, the, black, death, around, the, year, 1350, the, fastest, doubling, of, the, world, population, happened, between, 1950, and, 1986, a, doubling, from, 2, 5, to, 5, billion, people, in, 37, years, mainly, due, to, medical, advancements, and, increases, in, agricultural, productivity, due, to, its, impact, on, the, human, ability, to, grow, food, the, haber, process, enabled, the, global, population, to, increase, from, 1, 6, billion, in, 1900, to, 7, 7, billion, by, november, 2018, and, according, to, the, united, nations, eight, billion, as, of, november, 2022, some, researchers, have, analyzed, this, growth, in, population, like, other, animal, populations, human, populations, predictably, grow, and, shrink, according, to, their, available, food, supply, as, per, the, lotka, volterra, equations, including, agronomist, and, insect, ecologist, david, pimentel, behavioral, scientist, russell, hopfenberg, and, anthropologist, virginia, abernethy, world, population, has, gone, through, a, number, of, periods, of, growth, since, the, dawn, of, civilization, in, the, holocene, period, around, 10, 000, bce, the, beginning, of, civilization, roughly, coincides, with, the, receding, of, glacial, ice, following, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, farming, allowed, for, the, growth, of, populations, in, many, parts, of, the, world, including, europe, the, americas, and, china, through, the, 1600s, occasionally, disrupted, by, plagues, or, other, crises, for, example, the, black, death, is, thought, to, have, reduced, the, world, s, population, then, at, an, estimated, 450, million, in, 1350, to, between, 350, and, 375, million, by, 1400, after, the, start, of, the, industrial, revolution, during, the, 18th, century, the, rate, of, population, growth, began, to, increase, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, world, s, population, was, estimated, at, just, under, 1, billion, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, world, s, population, was, roughly, 1, 6, billion, by, 1940, this, figure, had, increased, to, 2, 3, billion, even, more, dramatic, growth, beginning, in, 1950, above, 1, 8, per, year, coincided, with, greatly, increased, food, production, as, a, result, of, the, industrialization, of, agriculture, brought, about, by, the, green, revolution, the, rate, of, human, population, growth, peaked, in, 1964, at, about, 2, 1, per, year, recent, additions, of, a, billion, humans, happened, very, quickly, 33, years, to, reach, three, billion, in, 1960, 14, years, for, four, billion, in, 1974, 13, years, for, five, billion, in, 1987, 12, years, for, six, billion, in, 1999, 11, years, for, seven, billion, in, 2010, and, 12, years, for, 8, billion, toward, the, end, of, 2022, by, un, in, 2017, population, projections, are, attempts, to, show, how, the, human, population, might, change, in, the, future, these, projections, help, to, forecast, the, population, s, impact, on, this, planet, and, humanity, s, future, well, being, models, of, population, growth, take, trends, in, human, development, and, apply, projections, into, the, future, to, understand, how, they, will, affect, fertility, and, mortality, and, thus, population, growth, the, most, recent, report, from, the, united, nations, population, division, issued, in, 2022, see, chart, projects, that, global, population, will, peak, around, the, year, 2086, at, about, 10, 4, billion, and, then, start, a, slow, decline, the, median, line, on, the, chart, as, with, earlier, projections, this, version, assumes, that, the, global, average, fertility, rate, will, continue, to, fall, but, even, further, from, 2, 5, births, per, woman, during, the, 2015, 2020, period, to, 1, 8, by, the, year, 2100, however, other, estimates, predict, additional, downward, pressure, on, fertility, such, as, more, education, and, family, planning, which, could, result, in, peak, population, during, the, 2060, 2070, period, rather, than, later, according, to, the, un, of, the, predicted, growth, in, world, population, between, 2020, and, 2050, all, of, that, change, will, come, from, less, developed, countries, and, more, than, half, will, come, from, just, 8, african, countries, it, is, predicted, that, the, population, of, sub, saharan, africa, will, double, by, 2050, the, pew, research, center, predicts, that, 50, of, births, in, the, year, 2100, will, be, in, africa, as, an, example, of, uneven, prospects, the, un, projects, that, nigeria, will, gain, about, 340, million, people, about, the, present, population, of, the, us, to, become, the, 3rd, most, populous, country, and, china, will, lose, almost, half, of, its, population, concerns, about, population, size, or, density, have, a, long, history, tertullian, a, resident, of, the, city, of, carthage, in, the, second, century, ce, criticized, population, at, the, time, our, numbers, are, burdensome, to, the, world, which, can, hardly, support, us, in, very, deed, pestilence, and, famine, and, wars, and, earthquakes, have, to, be, regarded, as, a, remedy, for, nations, as, the, means, of, pruning, the, luxuriance, of, the, human, race, despite, those, concerns, scholars, have, not, found, historic, societies, that, have, collapsed, because, of, overpopulation, or, overconsumption, by, the, early, 19th, century, intellectuals, such, as, thomas, malthus, predicted, that, humankind, would, outgrow, its, available, resources, because, a, finite, amount, of, land, would, be, incapable, of, supporting, a, population, with, limitless, potential, for, increase, during, the, 19th, century, malthus, work, particularly, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, was, often, interpreted, in, a, way, that, blamed, the, poor, alone, for, their, condition, and, helping, them, was, said, to, worsen, conditions, in, the, long, run, this, resulted, for, example, in, the, english, poor, laws, of, 1834, and, a, hesitating, response, to, the, irish, great, famine, of, 1845, 52, the, first, world, population, conference, was, held, in, 1927, in, geneva, organized, by, the, league, of, nations, and, margaret, sanger, paul, r, ehrlich, s, book, the, population, bomb, became, a, bestseller, upon, its, release, in, 1968, and, created, renewed, interest, in, overpopulation, the, book, predicted, population, growth, would, lead, to, famine, societal, collapse, and, other, social, environmental, and, economic, strife, in, the, coming, decades, and, advocated, for, policies, to, curb, it, the, club, of, rome, published, the, influential, report, the, limits, to, growth, in, 1972, which, used, computer, modeling, to, similarly, argue, that, continued, population, growth, trends, would, lead, to, global, system, collapse, the, idea, of, overpopulation, was, also, a, topic, of, some, works, of, english, language, science, fiction, and, dystopian, fiction, during, the, latter, part, of, the, 1960s, the, united, nations, held, the, first, of, three, world, population, conferences, in, 1974, human, population, and, family, planning, policies, were, adopted, by, some, nations, in, the, late, 20th, century, in, an, effort, to, curb, population, growth, including, in, china, and, india, albert, allen, bartlett, gave, more, than, 1, 742, lectures, on, the, threat, of, exponential, population, growth, starting, in, 1969, however, many, predictions, of, overpopulation, during, the, 20th, century, did, not, materialize, in, the, population, bomb, ehrlich, stated, in, the, 1970s, hundreds, of, millions, of, people, will, starve, to, death, in, spite, of, any, crash, programs, embarked, upon, now, with, later, editions, changing, to, in, the, 1980s, despite, admitting, some, of, his, earlier, predictions, did, not, come, to, pass, ehrlich, continues, to, advocate, that, overpopulation, is, a, major, issue, as, the, profile, of, environmental, issues, facing, humanity, increased, during, the, end, of, the, 20th, and, the, early, 21st, centuries, some, have, looked, to, population, growth, as, a, root, cause, in, the, 2000s, e, o, wilson, and, ron, nielsen, discussed, overpopulation, as, a, threat, to, the, quality, of, human, life, 37, 39, in, 2011, pentti, linkola, argued, that, human, overpopulation, represents, a, threat, to, earth, s, biosphere, a, 2015, survey, from, pew, research, center, reports, that, 82, of, scientists, associated, with, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, were, concerned, about, population, growth, in, 2017, more, than, one, third, of, 50, nobel, prize, winning, scientists, surveyed, by, the, times, higher, education, at, the, lindau, nobel, laureate, meetings, said, that, human, overpopulation, and, environmental, degradation, are, the, two, greatest, threats, facing, mankind, in, november, that, same, year, the, world, scientists, warning, to, humanity, a, second, notice, signed, by, 15, 364, scientists, from, 184, countries, indicated, that, rapid, human, population, growth, is, a, primary, driver, behind, many, ecological, and, even, societal, threats, ehlrich, and, other, scientists, at, a, conference, in, the, vatican, on, contemporary, species, extinction, linked, the, issue, to, population, growth, in, 2017, and, advocated, for, human, population, control, which, attracted, controversy, from, the, catholic, church, in, 2019, a, warning, on, climate, change, signed, by, 11, 000, scientists, from, 153, nations, said, that, human, population, growth, adds, 80, million, humans, annually, and, the, world, population, must, be, stabilized, and, ideally, gradually, reduced, within, a, framework, that, ensures, social, integrity, to, reduce, the, impact, of, population, growth, on, ghg, emissions, and, biodiversity, loss, in, 2020, a, quote, from, david, attenborough, about, how, humans, have, overrun, the, planet, was, shared, widely, online, and, became, his, most, popular, comment, on, the, internet, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, wwf, and, global, footprint, network, have, argued, that, the, annual, biocapacity, of, earth, has, exceeded, as, measured, using, the, ecological, footprint, in, 2006, wwf, s, living, planet, report, stated, that, in, order, for, all, humans, to, live, with, the, current, consumption, patterns, of, europeans, we, would, be, spending, three, times, more, than, what, the, planet, can, renew, according, to, these, calculations, humanity, as, a, whole, was, using, by, 2006, 40, more, than, what, earth, can, regenerate, another, study, by, the, wwf, in, 2014, found, that, it, would, take, the, equivalent, of, 1, 5, earths, of, bio, capacity, to, meet, humanity, s, current, levels, of, consumption, however, roger, martin, of, population, matters, states, the, view, the, poor, want, to, get, rich, and, i, want, them, to, get, rich, with, a, later, addition, of, course, we, have, to, change, consumption, habits, but, we, ve, also, got, to, stabilize, our, numbers, critics, have, questioned, the, simplifications, and, statistical, methods, used, in, calculating, ecological, footprints, therefore, global, footprint, network, and, its, partner, organizations, have, engaged, with, national, governments, and, international, agencies, to, test, the, results, reviews, have, been, produced, by, france, germany, the, european, commission, switzerland, luxembourg, japan, and, the, united, arab, emirates, some, point, out, that, a, more, refined, method, of, assessing, ecological, footprint, is, to, designate, sustainable, versus, non, sustainable, categories, of, consumption, attempts, have, been, made, to, estimate, the, world, s, carrying, capacity, for, humans, the, maximum, population, the, world, can, host, a, 2004, meta, analysis, of, 69, such, studies, from, 1694, until, 2001, found, the, average, predicted, maximum, number, of, people, the, earth, would, ever, have, was, 7, 7, billion, people, with, lower, and, upper, meta, bounds, at, 0, 65, and, 98, billion, people, respectively, they, conclude, recent, predictions, of, stabilized, world, population, levels, for, 2050, exceed, several, of, our, meta, estimates, of, a, world, population, limit, a, 2012, united, nations, report, summarized, 65, different, estimated, maximum, sustainable, population, sizes, and, the, most, common, estimate, was, 8, billion, advocates, of, reduced, population, often, put, forward, much, lower, numbers, paul, r, ehrlich, stated, in, 2018, that, the, optimum, population, is, between, 1, 5, and, 2, billion, in, 2022, ehrlich, and, other, contributors, to, the, scientists, warning, on, population, including, eileen, crist, william, j, ripple, william, e, rees, and, christopher, wolf, stated, that, environmental, analysts, put, the, sustainable, level, of, human, population, at, between, 2, and, 4, billion, people, geographer, chris, tucker, estimates, that, 3, billion, is, a, sustainable, number, although, proponents, of, human, overpopulation, have, expressed, concern, that, growing, population, will, lead, to, an, increase, in, global, poverty, and, infant, mortality, both, indicators, have, declined, over, the, last, 200, years, of, population, growth, a, number, of, scientists, have, argued, that, human, impacts, on, the, environment, and, accompanying, increase, in, resource, consumption, threatens, the, world, s, ecosystems, and, the, survival, of, human, civilization, the, interacademy, panel, statement, on, population, growth, which, was, ratified, by, 58, member, national, academies, in, 1994, states, that, unprecedented, population, growth, aggravates, many, environmental, problems, including, rising, levels, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, global, warming, and, pollution, indeed, some, analysts, claim, that, overpopulation, s, most, serious, impact, is, its, effect, on, the, environment, some, scientists, suggest, that, the, overall, human, impact, on, the, environment, during, the, great, acceleration, particularly, due, to, human, population, size, and, growth, economic, growth, overconsumption, pollution, and, proliferation, of, technology, has, pushed, the, planet, into, a, new, geological, epoch, known, as, the, anthropocene, biomass, of, mammals, on, earth, some, studies, and, commentary, link, population, growth, with, climate, change, critics, have, stated, that, population, growth, alone, may, have, less, influence, on, climate, change, than, other, factors, such, as, greenhouse, gas, emissions, per, capita, the, global, consumption, of, meat, is, projected, to, rise, by, as, much, as, 76, by, 2050, as, the, global, population, increases, with, this, projected, to, have, further, environmental, impacts, such, as, biodiversity, loss, and, increased, greenhouse, gas, emissions, a, july, 2017, study, published, in, environmental, research, letters, argued, that, the, most, significant, way, individuals, could, mitigate, their, own, carbon, footprint, is, to, have, fewer, children, followed, by, living, without, a, vehicle, forgoing, air, travel, and, adopting, a, plant, based, diet, however, even, in, countries, that, have, both, large, population, growth, and, major, ecological, problems, it, is, not, necessarily, true, that, curbing, the, population, growth, will, make, a, major, contribution, towards, resolving, all, environmental, problems, that, can, be, solved, simply, with, an, environmentalist, policy, approach, continued, population, growth, and, overconsumption, particularly, by, the, wealthy, have, been, posited, as, key, drivers, of, biodiversity, loss, and, contemporary, species, extinction, with, some, researchers, and, environmentalists, specifically, suggesting, this, indicates, a, human, overpopulation, scenario, the, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, released, by, ipbes, in, 2019, states, that, human, population, growth, is, a, factor, in, biodiversity, loss, igi, global, has, uncovered, the, growth, of, the, human, population, caused, encroachment, in, wild, habitats, which, have, led, to, their, destruction, posing, a, potential, threat, to, biodiversity, components, some, scientists, and, environmentalists, including, jared, diamond, e, o, wilson, jane, goodall, and, david, attenborough, contend, that, population, growth, is, devastating, to, biodiversity, wilson, for, example, has, expressed, concern, when, homo, sapiens, reached, a, population, of, six, billion, their, biomass, exceeded, that, of, any, other, large, land, dwelling, animal, species, that, had, ever, existed, by, over, 100, times, inger, andersen, the, executive, director, of, the, united, nations, environment, programme, stated, in, december, 2022, as, the, human, population, reached, a, milestone, of, 8, billion, and, as, delegates, were, meeting, for, the, 2022, united, nations, biodiversity, conference, that, we, need, to, understand, that, the, more, people, there, are, the, more, we, put, the, earth, under, heavy, pressure, as, far, as, biodiversity, is, concerned, we, are, at, war, with, nature, human, overpopulation, and, continued, population, growth, are, also, considered, by, some, including, animal, rights, attorney, doris, lin, and, philosopher, steven, best, to, be, an, animal, rights, issue, as, more, human, activity, means, the, destruction, of, animal, habitats, and, more, direct, killing, of, animals, 146, some, commentary, has, attributed, depletion, of, non, renewable, resources, such, as, land, food, and, water, to, overpopulation, and, suggested, it, could, lead, to, a, diminished, quality, of, human, life, ecologist, david, pimentel, was, one, such, proponent, saying, with, the, imbalance, growing, between, population, numbers, and, vital, life, sustaining, resources, humans, must, actively, conserve, cropland, freshwater, energy, and, biological, resources, there, is, a, need, to, develop, renewable, energy, resources, humans, everywhere, must, understand, that, rapid, population, growth, damages, the, earth, s, resources, and, diminishes, human, well, being, although, food, shortages, have, been, warned, as, a, consequence, of, overpopulation, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, global, food, production, exceeds, increasing, demand, from, global, population, growth, food, insecurity, in, some, regions, is, attributable, to, the, globally, unequal, distribution, of, food, supplies, the, notion, that, space, is, limited, has, been, decried, by, skeptics, who, point, out, that, the, earth, s, population, of, roughly, 6, 8, billion, people, could, comfortably, be, housed, an, area, comparable, in, size, to, the, state, of, texas, in, the, united, states, about, 269, 000, square, miles, or, 696, 706, 80, square, kilometres, critics, and, agricultural, experts, suggest, changes, to, policies, relating, to, land, use, or, agriculture, to, make, them, more, efficient, would, be, more, likely, to, resolve, land, issues, and, pressures, on, the, environment, than, focusing, on, reducing, population, alone, water, scarcity, which, threatens, agricultural, productivity, represents, a, global, issue, that, some, have, linked, to, population, growth, colin, butler, wrote, in, the, lancet, in, 1994, that, overpopulation, also, has, economic, consequences, for, certain, countries, due, to, resource, use, it, was, speculated, by, aldous, huxley, in, 1958, that, democracy, is, threatened, by, overpopulation, and, could, give, rise, to, totalitarian, style, governments, physics, professor, albert, allen, bartlett, at, the, university, of, colorado, boulder, warned, in, 2000, that, overpopulation, and, the, development, of, technology, are, the, two, major, causes, of, the, diminution, of, democracy, however, over, the, last, 200, years, of, population, growth, the, actual, level, of, personal, freedom, has, increased, rather, than, declined, john, harte, has, argued, population, growth, is, a, factor, in, numerous, social, issues, including, unemployment, overcrowding, bad, governance, and, decaying, infrastructure, daron, acemoglu, and, others, suggested, in, a, 2017, paper, that, since, the, second, world, war, countries, with, higher, population, growth, rates, experienced, the, most, social, conflict, some, advocates, have, suggested, societal, problems, such, as, hunger, and, mass, unemployment, are, linked, to, overpopulation, according, to, anthropologist, jason, hickel, the, global, capitalist, system, creates, pressures, for, population, growth, more, people, means, more, labour, cheaper, labour, and, more, consumers, he, and, his, colleagues, have, also, demonstrated, that, capitalist, elites, throughout, recent, history, have, used, pro, natalist, state, policies, to, prevent, women, from, practicing, family, planning, in, order, to, grow, the, size, of, their, workforce, hickel, has, however, argued, that, the, cause, of, negative, environmental, impacts, is, resource, extraction, by, wealthy, countries, he, concludes, that, we, should, not, ignore, the, relationship, between, population, growth, and, ecology, but, we, must, not, treat, these, as, operating, in, a, social, and, political, vacuum, a, 2021, article, in, ethics, medicine, and, public, health, argued, in, light, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, that, epidemics, and, pandemics, were, made, more, likely, by, overpopulation, globalization, urbanization, and, encroachment, into, natural, habitats, they, both, play, a, significant, role, impacting, human, populations, including, widespread, illness, death, and, social, disruption, while, they, can, leave, a, temporary, loss, of, population, it, is, followed, by, significant, loss, and, suffering, these, events, are, not, the, sole, reason, for, overpopulation, but, lack, of, access, to, family, planning, and, reproductive, contraptions, poverty, and, resource, depletion, several, strategies, have, been, proposed, to, mitigate, overpopulation, several, scientists, including, paul, ehrlich, gretchen, daily, and, tim, flannery, proposed, that, humanity, should, work, at, stabilizing, its, absolute, numbers, as, a, starting, point, towards, beginning, the, process, of, reducing, the, total, numbers, they, suggested, several, possible, approaches, including, there, is, good, evidence, from, many, parts, of, the, world, that, when, women, and, couples, have, the, freedom, to, choose, how, many, children, to, have, they, tend, to, have, smaller, families, some, scientists, such, as, corey, bradshaw, and, barry, brook, suggest, that, given, the, inexorable, demographic, momentum, of, the, global, human, population, sustainability, can, be, achieved, more, rapidly, with, a, short, term, focus, on, technological, and, social, innovations, along, with, reducing, consumption, rates, while, treating, population, planning, as, a, long, term, goal, however, most, scientists, believe, that, achieving, genuine, sustainability, is, a, long, term, project, and, that, addressing, population, and, consumption, levels, are, both, essential, to, achieving, it, in, 1992, more, than, 1700, scientists, from, around, the, world, signed, onto, a, world, scientists, warning, to, humanity, including, a, majority, of, the, living, nobel, prize, winners, in, the, sciences, the, earth, is, finite, they, wrote, its, ability, to, absorb, wastes, and, destructive, effluent, is, finite, its, ability, to, provide, food, and, energy, is, finite, its, ability, to, provide, for, growing, numbers, of, people, is, finite, and, we, are, fast, approaching, many, of, the, earth, s, limits, the, warning, noted, pressures, resulting, from, unrestrained, population, growth, put, demands, on, the, natural, world, that, can, overwhelm, any, efforts, to, achieve, a, sustainable, future, if, we, are, to, halt, the, destruction, of, our, environment, we, must, accept, limits, to, that, growth, two, of, the, five, areas, where, the, signatories, requested, immediate, action, were, stabilize, population, and, ensure, sexual, equality, and, guarantee, women, control, over, their, own, reproductive, decisions, in, a, follow, up, message, 25, years, later, william, ripple, and, colleagues, issued, the, world, scientists, warning, to, humanity, a, second, notice, this, time, more, than, 15, 000, scientists, from, around, the, world, signed, on, we, are, jeopardizing, our, future, by, not, reining, in, our, intense, but, geographically, and, demographically, uneven, material, consumption, and, by, not, perceiving, continued, rapid, population, growth, as, a, primary, driver, behind, many, ecological, and, even, societal, threats, they, wrote, by, failing, to, adequately, limit, population, growth, reassess, the, role, of, an, economy, rooted, in, growth, reduce, greenhouse, gases, incentivize, renewable, energy, protect, habitat, restore, ecosystems, curb, pollution, halt, defaunation, and, constrain, invasive, alien, species, humanity, is, not, taking, the, urgent, steps, needed, to, safeguard, our, imperilled, biosphere, this, second, scientists, warning, urged, attention, to, both, excessive, consumption, and, continued, population, growth, like, its, predecessor, it, did, not, specify, a, definite, global, human, carrying, capacity, but, its, call, to, action, included, estimating, a, scientifically, defensible, sustainable, human, population, size, for, the, long, term, while, rallying, nations, and, leaders, to, support, that, vital, goal, subsequent, scientists, calls, to, action, have, also, included, calls, for, population, planning, the, 2020, world, scientists, warning, of, a, climate, emergency, stated, economic, and, population, growth, are, among, the, most, important, drivers, of, increases, in, co2, emissions, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, therefore, the, study, noted, we, need, bold, and, drastic, transformations, regarding, economic, and, population, policies, the, world, population, must, be, stabilized, and, ideally, gradually, reduced, it, concluded, implying, that, humanity, is, overpopulated, given, current, and, expected, levels, of, resource, use, and, waste, generation, a, follow, up, scientists, warning, on, climate, change, in, 2021, reiterated, the, need, to, plan, and, limit, human, numbers, to, achieve, sustainability, proposing, as, a, goal, stabilizing, and, gradually, reducing, the, population, by, providing, voluntary, family, planning, and, supporting, education, and, rights, for, all, girls, and, young, women, which, has, been, proven, to, lower, fertility, rates, education, and, empowerment, of, women, and, giving, access, to, family, planning, and, contraception, have, a, demonstrated, impact, on, reducing, birthrates, many, studies, conclude, that, educating, girls, reduces, the, number, of, children, they, have, one, option, according, to, some, activists, is, to, focus, on, education, about, family, planning, and, birth, control, methods, and, to, make, birth, control, devices, like, condoms, contraceptive, pills, and, intrauterine, devices, easily, available, worldwide, nearly, 40, of, pregnancies, are, unintended, some, 80, million, unintended, pregnancies, each, year, an, estimated, 350, million, women, in, the, poorest, countries, of, the, world, either, did, not, want, their, last, child, do, not, want, another, child, or, want, to, space, their, pregnancies, but, they, lack, access, to, information, affordable, means, and, services, to, determine, the, size, and, spacing, of, their, families, in, the, developing, world, some, 514, 000, women, die, annually, of, complications, from, pregnancy, and, abortion, with, 86, of, these, deaths, occurring, in, the, sub, saharan, africa, region, and, south, asia, additionally, 8, million, infants, die, many, because, of, malnutrition, or, preventable, diseases, especially, from, lack, of, access, to, clean, drinking, water, women, s, rights, and, their, reproductive, rights, in, particular, are, issues, regarded, to, have, vital, importance, in, the, debate, anthropologist, jason, hickel, asserts, that, a, nation, s, population, growth, rapidly, declines, even, within, a, single, generation, when, policies, relating, to, women, s, health, and, reproductive, rights, children, s, health, to, ensure, parents, they, will, survive, to, adulthood, and, expanding, education, and, economic, opportunities, for, girls, and, women, are, implemented, a, 2020, paper, by, william, j, ripple, and, other, scientists, argued, in, favor, of, population, policies, that, could, advance, social, justice, such, as, by, abolishing, child, marriage, expanding, family, planning, services, and, reforms, that, improve, education, for, women, and, girls, and, at, the, same, time, mitigate, the, impact, of, population, growth, on, climate, change, and, biodiversity, loss, in, a, 2022, warning, on, population, published, by, science, of, the, total, environment, ripple, ehrlich, and, other, scientists, appealed, to, families, around, the, world, to, have, no, more, than, one, child, and, also, urged, policy, makers, to, improve, education, for, young, females, and, provide, high, quality, family, planning, services, an, argument, for, space, colonization, is, to, mitigate, proposed, impacts, of, overpopulation, of, earth, such, as, resource, depletion, if, the, resources, of, space, were, opened, to, use, and, viable, life, supporting, habitats, were, built, earth, would, no, longer, define, the, limitations, of, growth, although, many, of, earth, s, resources, are, non, renewable, off, planet, colonies, could, satisfy, the, majority, of, the, planet, s, resource, requirements, with, the, availability, of, extraterrestrial, resources, demand, on, terrestrial, ones, would, decline, proponents, of, this, idea, include, stephen, hawking, and, gerard, k, o, neill, despite, the, increase, in, population, density, within, cities, and, the, emergence, of, megacities, un, habitat, data, corp, states, in, its, reports, that, urbanization, may, be, the, best, compromise, in, the, face, of, global, population, growth, cities, concentrate, human, activity, within, limited, areas, limiting, the, breadth, of, environmental, damage, un, habitat, says, this, is, only, possible, if, urban, planning, is, significantly, improved, paul, r, ehrlich, proposed, in, the, population, bomb, that, rhetoric, supporting, the, increase, of, city, density, is, a, means, of, avoiding, dealing, with, what, he, views, as, the, root, problem, of, overpopulation, and, has, been, promoted, by, what, he, views, as, the, same, interests, that, have, allegedly, profited, from, population, increase, such, as, property, developers, the, banking, system, which, invests, in, property, development, industry, and, municipal, councils, subsequent, authors, point, to, growth, economics, as, driving, governments, seek, city, growth, and, expansion, at, any, cost, disregarding, the, impact, it, might, have, on, the, environment, the, concept, of, human, overpopulation, and, its, attribution, as, a, cause, of, environmental, issues, are, controversial, some, critics, including, nicholas, eberstadt, fred, pearce, dominic, lawson, and, betsy, hartmann, refer, to, overpopulation, as, a, myth, predicted, exponential, population, growth, or, any, population, explosion, did, not, materialise, instead, population, growth, slowed, critics, suggest, that, enough, resources, are, available, to, support, projected, population, growth, and, that, human, impacts, on, the, environment, are, not, attributable, to, overpopulation, according, to, libertarian, think, tank, the, fraser, institute, both, the, idea, of, overpopulation, and, the, alleged, depletion, of, resources, are, myths, most, resources, are, now, more, abundant, than, a, few, decades, ago, thanks, to, technological, progress, the, institute, also, questions, the, sincerity, of, advocates, of, population, control, in, poor, countries, nicholas, eberstadt, a, political, economist, has, criticised, the, idea, of, overpopulation, saying, that, overpopulation, is, not, really, overpopulation, it, is, a, question, of, poverty, a, 2020, study, in, the, lancet, concluded, that, continued, trends, in, female, educational, attainment, and, access, to, contraception, will, hasten, declines, in, fertility, and, slow, population, growth, with, projections, suggesting, world, population, would, peak, at, 9, 73, billion, in, 2064, and, fall, by, 2100, media, commentary, interpreted, this, as, suggesting, overconsumption, represents, a, greater, environmental, threat, as, an, overpopulation, scenario, may, never, occur, some, human, population, planning, strategies, advocated, by, proponents, of, overpopulation, are, controversial, for, ethical, reasons, those, concerned, with, overpopulation, including, paul, ehrlich, have, been, accused, of, influencing, human, rights, abuses, including, forced, sterilisation, policies, in, india, and, under, china, s, one, child, policy, as, well, as, mandatory, or, coercive, birth, control, measures, taken, in, other, countries, influential, advocates, such, as, betsy, hartmann, consider, the, myth, of, overpopulation, to, be, destructive, as, it, prevents, constructive, thinking, and, action, on, reproductive, rights, which, acutely, affects, women, and, communities, of, women, in, poverty, the, 1994, international, conference, on, population, and, development, icpd, defines, reproductive, rights, as, the, basic, right, of, all, couples, and, individuals, to, decide, freely, and, responsibly, the, number, spacing, and, timing, of, their, children, and, to, have, the, information, to, do, so, this, oversimplification, of, human, overpopulation, leads, individuals, to, believe, there, are, simple, solutions, and, the, creation, of, population, policies, that, limit, reproductive, rights, in, response, philosopher, tim, meijers, asks, the, question, to, what, extent, is, it, fair, to, require, people, to, refrain, from, procreating, as, part, of, a, strategy, to, make, the, world, more, sustainable, meijers, rejects, the, idea, that, the, right, to, reproduce, can, be, unlimited, since, this, would, not, be, universalizable, in, a, world, in, which, everybody, had, many, children, extreme, scarcity, would, arise, and, stable, institutions, could, prove, unsustainable, this, would, lead, to, violation, of, rather, uncontroversial, rights, such, as, the, right, to, life, and, to, health, and, subsistence, in, the, actual, world, today, excessive, procreation, could, also, undermine, our, descendants, right, to, have, children, since, people, are, likely, to, refrain, and, perhaps, should, refrain, from, bringing, children, into, an, insecure, and, dangerous, world, meijers, sarah, conly, diana, coole, and, other, ethicists, conclude, that, people, have, a, right, to, found, a, family, but, not, to, unlimited, numbers, of, children, ehrlich, advocated, in, the, population, bomb, that, various, forms, of, coercion, such, as, removing, tax, benefits, for, having, additional, children, be, used, in, cases, when, voluntary, population, planning, policies, fail, some, nations, like, china, have, used, strict, or, coercive, measures, such, as, the, one, child, policy, to, reduce, birth, rates, compulsory, or, semi, compulsory, sterilization, such, as, for, token, material, compensation, or, easing, of, penalties, has, also, been, implemented, in, many, countries, as, a, form, of, population, control, another, choice, based, approach, is, financial, compensation, or, other, benefits, by, the, state, offered, to, people, who, voluntarily, undergo, sterilization, such, policies, have, been, introduced, by, the, government, of, india, the, indian, government, of, narendra, modi, introduced, population, policies, in, 2019, including, offering, incentives, for, sterilization, by, citing, the, risks, of, a, population, explosion, although, demographers, have, criticized, that, basis, with, india, thought, to, be, undergoing, demographic, transition, and, its, fertility, rate, falling, the, policies, have, also, received, criticism, from, human, and, women, s, rights, groups, the, concept, of, human, overpopulation, has, been, criticized, by, some, scholars, and, environmentalists, as, being, racist, and, having, roots, in, colonialism, and, white, supremacy, since, control, and, reduction, of, human, population, is, often, focused, on, the, global, south, instead, of, on, overconsumption, and, the, global, north, where, it, occurs, paul, ehrlich, s, population, bomb, begins, with, him, describing, first, knowing, the, feel, of, overpopulation, from, a, visit, to, delhi, which, some, critics, have, accused, of, having, racial, undertones, george, monbiot, has, said, when, affluent, white, people, wrongly, transfer, the, blame, for, their, environmental, impacts, on, to, the, birthrate, of, much, poorer, brown, and, black, people, their, finger, pointing, reinforces, narratives, it, is, inherently, racist, overpopulation, is, a, common, component, of, ecofascist, ideology, scholar, heather, alberro, rejects, the, overpopulation, argument, stating, that, the, human, population, growth, is, rapidly, slowing, down, the, underlying, problem, is, not, the, number, of, people, but, how, resources, are, distributed, and, that, the, idea, of, overpopulation, could, fuel, a, racist, backlash, against, the, population, of, poor, countries, in, response, population, activists, argue, that, overpopulation, is, a, problem, in, both, rich, and, poor, countries, and, arguably, a, worse, problem, in, rich, countries, where, residents, higher, per, capita, consumption, ratchets, up, the, impacts, of, their, excessive, numbers, feminist, scholar, donna, haraway, notes, that, a, commitment, to, enlarging, the, moral, community, to, include, nonhuman, beings, logically, entails, people, s, willingness, to, limit, their, numbers, and, make, room, for, them, ecological, economists, like, herman, daly, and, joshua, farley, believe, that, reducing, populations, will, make, it, easier, to, achieve, steady, state, economies, that, decrease, total, consumption, and, pollution, to, manageable, levels, finally, as, karin, kuhlemann, observes, that, a, population, s, size, is, stable, in, no, way, entails, sustainability, it, may, be, sustainable, or, it, may, be, far, too, large, according, to, the, writer, and, journalist, krithika, varagur, myths, and, misinformation, about, overpopulation, of, rohingya, people, in, myanmar, is, thought, to, have, driven, their, genocide, in, the, 2010s, the, following, organizations, advocate, for, a, limit, to, human, population, growth, although, their, focus, may, be, on, related, issues, such, as, environmental, protection, organization, advocate, against, limits, to, human, population, growth
