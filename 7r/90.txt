a, bank, is, a, financial, institution, that, accepts, deposits, from, the, public, and, creates, a, demand, deposit, while, simultaneously, making, loans, lending, activities, can, be, directly, performed, by, the, bank, or, indirectly, through, capital, markets, whereas, banks, play, an, important, role, in, financial, stability, and, the, economy, of, a, country, most, jurisdictions, exercise, a, high, degree, of, regulation, over, banks, most, countries, have, institutionalized, a, system, known, as, fractional, reserve, banking, under, which, banks, hold, liquid, assets, equal, to, only, a, portion, of, their, current, liabilities, in, addition, to, other, regulations, intended, to, ensure, liquidity, banks, are, generally, subject, to, minimum, capital, requirements, based, on, an, international, set, of, capital, standards, the, basel, accords, banking, in, its, modern, sense, evolved, in, the, fourteenth, century, in, the, prosperous, cities, of, renaissance, italy, but, in, many, ways, functioned, as, a, continuation, of, ideas, and, concepts, of, credit, and, lending, that, had, their, roots, in, the, ancient, world, in, the, history, of, banking, a, number, of, banking, dynasties, notably, the, medicis, the, pazzi, the, fuggers, the, welsers, the, berenbergs, and, the, rothschilds, have, played, a, central, role, over, many, centuries, the, oldest, existing, retail, bank, is, banca, monte, dei, paschi, di, siena, founded, in, 1472, while, the, oldest, existing, merchant, bank, is, berenberg, bank, founded, in, 1590, banking, as, an, archaic, activity, or, quasi, banking, is, thought, to, have, begun, as, early, as, the, end, of, the, 4th, millennium, bce, to, the, 3rd, millennia, bce, the, present, era, of, banking, can, be, traced, to, medieval, and, early, renaissance, italy, to, the, rich, cities, in, the, centre, and, north, like, florence, lucca, siena, venice, and, genoa, the, bardi, and, peruzzi, families, dominated, banking, in, 14th, century, florence, establishing, branches, in, many, other, parts, of, europe, giovanni, di, bicci, de, medici, set, up, one, of, the, most, famous, italian, banks, the, medici, bank, in, 1397, the, republic, of, genoa, founded, the, earliest, known, state, deposit, bank, and, banco, di, san, giorgio, bank, of, st, george, in, 1407, at, genoa, italy, fractional, reserve, banking, and, the, issue, of, banknotes, emerged, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, merchants, started, to, store, their, gold, with, the, goldsmiths, of, london, who, possessed, private, vaults, and, who, charged, a, fee, for, that, service, in, exchange, for, each, deposit, of, precious, metal, the, goldsmiths, issued, receipts, certifying, the, quantity, and, purity, of, the, metal, they, held, as, a, bailee, these, receipts, could, not, be, assigned, only, the, original, depositor, could, collect, the, stored, goods, gradually, the, goldsmiths, began, to, lend, money, out, on, behalf, of, the, depositor, and, promissory, notes, which, evolved, into, banknotes, were, issued, for, money, deposited, as, a, loan, to, the, goldsmith, thus, by, the, 19th, century, we, find, in, ordinary, cases, of, deposits, of, money, with, banking, corporations, or, bankers, the, transaction, amounts, to, a, mere, loan, or, mutuum, and, the, bank, is, to, restore, not, the, same, money, but, an, equivalent, sum, whenever, it, is, demanded, and, money, when, paid, into, a, bank, ceases, altogether, to, be, the, money, of, the, principal, see, parker, v, marchant, 1, phillips, 360, it, is, then, the, money, of, the, banker, who, is, bound, to, return, an, equivalent, by, paying, a, similar, sum, to, that, deposited, with, him, when, he, is, asked, for, it, the, goldsmith, paid, interest, on, deposits, since, the, promissory, notes, were, payable, on, demand, and, the, advances, loans, to, the, goldsmith, s, customers, were, repayable, over, a, longer, time, period, this, was, an, early, form, of, fractional, reserve, banking, the, promissory, notes, developed, into, an, assignable, instrument, which, could, circulate, as, a, safe, and, convenient, form, of, money, backed, by, the, goldsmith, s, promise, to, pay, allowing, goldsmiths, to, advance, loans, with, little, risk, of, default, thus, the, goldsmiths, of, london, became, the, forerunners, of, banking, by, creating, new, money, based, on, credit, the, bank, of, england, originated, the, permanent, issue, of, banknotes, in, 1695, the, royal, bank, of, scotland, established, the, first, overdraft, facility, in, 1728, by, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, lubbock, s, bank, had, established, a, bankers, clearing, house, in, london, to, allow, multiple, banks, to, clear, transactions, the, rothschilds, pioneered, international, finance, on, a, large, scale, financing, the, purchase, of, shares, in, the, suez, canal, for, the, british, government, in, 1875, the, word, bank, was, taken, into, middle, english, from, middle, french, banque, from, old, italian, banco, meaning, table, from, old, high, german, banc, bank, bench, counter, benches, were, used, as, makeshift, desks, or, exchange, counters, during, the, renaissance, by, florentine, bankers, who, used, to, make, their, transactions, atop, desks, covered, by, green, tablecloths, the, definition, of, a, bank, varies, from, country, to, country, see, the, relevant, country, pages, for, more, information, under, english, common, law, a, banker, is, defined, as, a, person, who, carries, on, the, business, of, banking, by, conducting, current, accounts, for, their, customers, paying, cheques, drawn, on, them, and, also, collecting, cheques, for, their, customers, in, most, common, law, jurisdictions, there, is, a, bills, of, exchange, act, that, codifies, the, law, in, relation, to, negotiable, instruments, including, cheques, and, this, act, contains, a, statutory, definition, of, the, term, banker, banker, includes, a, body, of, persons, whether, incorporated, or, not, who, carry, on, the, business, of, banking, section, 2, interpretation, although, this, definition, seems, circular, it, is, actually, functional, because, it, ensures, that, the, legal, basis, for, bank, transactions, such, as, cheques, does, not, depend, on, how, the, bank, is, structured, or, regulated, the, business, of, banking, is, in, many, common, law, countries, not, defined, by, statute, but, by, common, law, the, definition, above, in, other, english, common, law, jurisdictions, there, are, statutory, definitions, of, the, business, of, banking, or, banking, business, when, looking, at, these, definitions, it, is, important, to, keep, in, mind, that, they, are, defining, the, business, of, banking, for, the, purposes, of, the, legislation, and, not, necessarily, in, general, in, particular, most, of, the, definitions, are, from, legislation, that, has, the, purpose, of, regulating, and, supervising, banks, rather, than, regulating, the, actual, business, of, banking, however, in, many, cases, the, statutory, definition, closely, mirrors, the, common, law, one, examples, of, statutory, definitions, since, the, advent, of, eftpos, electronic, funds, transfer, at, point, of, sale, direct, credit, direct, debit, and, internet, banking, the, cheque, has, lost, its, primacy, in, most, banking, systems, as, a, payment, instrument, this, has, led, legal, theorists, to, suggest, that, the, cheque, based, definition, should, be, broadened, to, include, financial, institutions, that, conduct, current, accounts, for, customers, and, enable, customers, to, pay, and, be, paid, by, third, parties, even, if, they, do, not, pay, and, collect, cheques, banks, act, as, payment, agents, by, conducting, checking, or, current, accounts, for, customers, paying, cheques, drawn, by, customers, in, the, bank, and, collecting, cheques, deposited, to, customers, current, accounts, banks, also, enable, customer, payments, via, other, payment, methods, such, as, automated, clearing, house, ach, wire, transfers, or, telegraphic, transfer, eftpos, and, automated, teller, machines, atms, banks, borrow, money, by, accepting, funds, deposited, on, current, accounts, by, accepting, term, deposits, and, by, issuing, debt, securities, such, as, banknotes, and, bonds, banks, lend, money, by, making, advances, to, customers, on, current, accounts, by, making, installment, loans, and, by, investing, in, marketable, debt, securities, and, other, forms, of, money, lending, banks, provide, different, payment, services, and, a, bank, account, is, considered, indispensable, by, most, businesses, and, individuals, non, banks, that, provide, payment, services, such, as, remittance, companies, are, normally, not, considered, as, an, adequate, substitute, for, a, bank, account, banks, issue, new, money, when, they, make, loans, in, contemporary, banking, systems, regulators, set, a, minimum, level, of, reserve, funds, that, banks, must, hold, against, the, deposit, liabilities, created, by, the, funding, of, these, loans, in, order, to, ensure, that, the, banks, can, meet, demands, for, payment, of, such, deposits, these, reserves, can, be, acquired, through, the, acceptance, of, new, deposits, sale, of, other, assets, or, borrowing, from, other, banks, including, the, central, bank, activities, undertaken, by, banks, include, personal, banking, corporate, banking, investment, banking, private, banking, transaction, banking, insurance, consumer, finance, trade, finance, and, other, related, banks, offer, many, different, channels, to, access, their, banking, and, other, services, a, bank, can, generate, revenue, in, a, variety, of, different, ways, including, interest, transaction, fees, and, financial, advice, traditionally, the, most, significant, method, is, via, charging, interest, on, the, capital, it, lends, out, to, customers, the, bank, profits, from, the, difference, between, the, level, of, interest, it, pays, for, deposits, and, other, sources, of, funds, and, the, level, of, interest, it, charges, in, its, lending, activities, this, difference, is, referred, to, as, the, spread, between, the, cost, of, funds, and, the, loan, interest, rate, historically, profitability, from, lending, activities, has, been, cyclical, and, dependent, on, the, needs, and, strengths, of, loan, customers, and, the, stage, of, the, economic, cycle, fees, and, financial, advice, constitute, a, more, stable, revenue, stream, and, banks, have, therefore, placed, more, emphasis, on, these, revenue, lines, to, smooth, their, financial, performance, in, the, past, 20, years, american, banks, have, taken, many, measures, to, ensure, that, they, remain, profitable, while, responding, to, increasingly, changing, market, conditions, this, helps, in, making, a, profit, and, facilitates, economic, development, as, a, whole, recently, as, banks, have, been, faced, with, pressure, from, fintechs, new, and, additional, business, models, have, been, suggested, such, as, freemium, monetisation, of, data, white, labeling, of, banking, and, payment, applications, or, the, cross, selling, of, complementary, products, banks, face, a, number, of, risks, in, order, to, conduct, their, business, and, how, well, these, risks, are, managed, and, understood, is, a, key, driver, behind, profitability, and, how, much, capital, a, bank, is, required, to, hold, bank, capital, consists, principally, of, equity, retained, earnings, and, subordinated, debt, some, of, the, main, risks, faced, by, banks, include, the, capital, requirement, is, a, bank, regulation, which, sets, a, framework, within, which, a, bank, or, depository, institution, must, manage, its, balance, sheet, the, categorisation, of, assets, and, capital, is, highly, standardised, so, that, it, can, be, risk, weighted, after, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, regulators, force, banks, to, issue, contingent, convertible, bonds, cocos, these, are, hybrid, capital, securities, that, absorb, losses, in, accordance, with, their, contractual, terms, when, the, capital, of, the, issuing, bank, falls, below, a, certain, level, then, debt, is, reduced, and, bank, capitalisation, gets, a, boost, owing, to, their, capacity, to, absorb, losses, cocos, have, the, potential, to, satisfy, regulatory, capital, requirement, the, economic, functions, of, banks, include, banks, are, susceptible, to, many, forms, of, risk, which, have, triggered, occasional, systemic, crises, these, include, liquidity, risk, where, many, depositors, may, request, withdrawals, in, excess, of, available, funds, credit, risk, the, chance, that, those, who, owe, money, to, the, bank, will, not, repay, it, and, interest, rate, risk, the, possibility, that, the, bank, will, become, unprofitable, if, rising, interest, rates, force, it, to, pay, relatively, more, on, its, deposits, than, it, receives, on, its, loans, banking, crises, have, developed, many, times, throughout, history, when, one, or, more, risks, have, emerged, for, the, banking, sector, as, a, whole, prominent, examples, include, the, bank, run, that, occurred, during, the, great, depression, the, u, s, savings, and, loan, crisis, in, the, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, the, japanese, banking, crisis, during, the, 1990s, and, the, sub, prime, mortgage, crisis, in, the, 2000s, the, 2023, global, banking, crisis, is, the, latest, of, these, crises, in, march, 2023, liquidity, shortages, and, bank, insolvencies, led, to, three, bank, failures, in, the, united, states, and, within, two, weeks, several, of, the, world, s, largest, banks, failed, or, were, shut, down, by, regulators, assets, of, the, largest, 1, 000, banks, in, the, world, grew, by, 6, 8, in, the, 2008, 2009, financial, year, to, a, record, us, 96, 4, trillion, while, profits, declined, by, 85, to, us, 115, billion, growth, in, assets, in, adverse, market, conditions, was, largely, a, result, of, recapitalisation, eu, banks, held, the, largest, share, of, the, total, 56, in, 2008, 2009, down, from, 61, in, the, previous, year, asian, banks, share, increased, from, 12, to, 14, during, the, year, while, the, share, of, us, banks, increased, from, 11, to, 13, fee, revenue, generated, by, global, investment, in, banking, totalled, us, 66, 3, billion, in, 2009, up, 12, on, the, previous, year, the, united, states, has, the, most, banks, in, the, world, in, terms, of, institutions, 5, 330, as, of, 2015, and, possibly, branches, 81, 607, as, of, 2015, this, is, an, indicator, of, the, geography, and, regulatory, structure, of, the, us, resulting, in, a, large, number, of, small, to, medium, sized, institutions, in, its, banking, system, as, of, november, 2009, china, s, top, four, banks, have, in, excess, of, 67, 000, branches, icbc, 18000, boc, 12000, ccb, 13000, abc, 24000, with, an, additional, 140, smaller, banks, with, an, undetermined, number, of, branches, japan, had, 129, banks, and, 12, 000, branches, in, 2004, germany, france, and, italy, each, had, more, than, 30, 000, branches, more, than, double, the, 15, 000, branches, in, the, united, kingdom, between, 1985, and, 2018, banks, engaged, in, around, 28, 798, mergers, or, acquisitions, either, as, the, acquirer, or, the, target, company, the, overall, known, value, of, these, deals, cumulates, to, around, 5, 169, bil, usd, in, terms, of, value, there, have, been, two, major, waves, 1999, and, 2007, which, both, peaked, at, around, 460, bil, usd, followed, by, a, steep, decline, 82, from, 2007, until, 2018, here, is, a, list, of, the, largest, deals, in, history, in, terms, of, value, with, participation, from, at, least, one, bank, currently, commercial, banks, are, regulated, in, most, jurisdictions, by, government, entities, and, require, a, special, bank, license, to, operate, usually, the, definition, of, the, business, of, banking, for, the, purposes, of, regulation, is, extended, to, include, acceptance, of, deposits, even, if, they, are, not, repayable, to, the, customer, s, order, although, money, lending, by, itself, is, generally, not, included, in, the, definition, unlike, most, other, regulated, industries, the, regulator, is, typically, also, a, participant, in, the, market, being, either, publicly, or, privately, governed, central, bank, central, banks, also, typically, have, a, monopoly, on, the, business, of, issuing, banknotes, however, in, some, countries, this, is, not, the, case, in, the, uk, for, example, the, financial, services, authority, licenses, banks, and, some, commercial, banks, such, as, the, bank, of, scotland, issue, their, own, banknotes, in, addition, to, those, issued, by, the, bank, of, england, the, uk, government, s, central, bank, banking, law, is, based, on, a, contractual, analysis, of, the, relationship, between, the, bank, defined, above, and, the, customer, defined, as, any, entity, for, which, the, bank, agrees, to, conduct, an, account, the, law, implies, rights, and, obligations, into, this, relationship, as, follows, these, implied, contractual, terms, may, be, modified, by, express, agreement, between, the, customer, and, the, bank, the, statutes, and, regulations, in, force, within, a, particular, jurisdiction, may, also, modify, the, above, terms, or, create, new, rights, obligations, or, limitations, relevant, to, the, bank, customer, relationship, some, types, of, financial, institutions, such, as, building, societies, and, credit, unions, may, be, partly, or, wholly, exempt, from, bank, license, requirements, and, therefore, regulated, under, separate, rules, the, requirements, for, the, issue, of, a, bank, license, vary, between, jurisdictions, but, typically, include, banks, activities, can, be, divided, into, most, banks, are, profit, making, private, enterprises, however, some, are, owned, by, the, government, or, are, non, profit, organisations, the, united, states, banking, industry, is, one, of, the, most, heavily, regulated, and, guarded, in, the, world, with, multiple, specialised, and, focused, regulators, all, banks, with, fdic, insured, deposits, have, the, federal, deposit, insurance, corporation, fdic, as, a, regulator, however, for, soundness, examinations, i, e, whether, a, bank, is, operating, in, a, sound, manner, the, federal, reserve, is, the, primary, federal, regulator, for, fed, member, state, banks, the, office, of, the, comptroller, of, the, currency, occ, is, the, primary, federal, regulator, for, national, banks, state, non, member, banks, are, examined, by, the, state, agencies, as, well, as, the, fdic, 236, national, banks, have, one, primary, regulator, the, occ, each, regulatory, agency, has, its, own, set, of, rules, and, regulations, to, which, banks, and, thrifts, must, adhere, the, federal, financial, institutions, examination, council, ffiec, was, established, in, 1979, as, a, formal, inter, agency, body, empowered, to, prescribe, uniform, principles, standards, and, report, forms, for, the, federal, examination, of, financial, institutions, although, the, ffiec, has, resulted, in, a, greater, degree, of, regulatory, consistency, between, the, agencies, the, rules, and, regulations, are, constantly, changing, in, addition, to, changing, regulations, changes, in, the, industry, have, led, to, consolidations, within, the, federal, reserve, fdic, ots, and, occ, offices, have, been, closed, supervisory, regions, have, been, merged, staff, levels, have, been, reduced, and, budgets, have, been, cut, the, remaining, regulators, face, an, increased, burden, with, an, increased, workload, and, more, banks, per, regulator, while, banks, struggle, to, keep, up, with, the, changes, in, the, regulatory, environment, regulators, struggle, to, manage, their, workload, and, effectively, regulate, their, banks, the, impact, of, these, changes, is, that, banks, are, receiving, less, hands, on, assessment, by, the, regulators, less, time, spent, with, each, institution, and, the, potential, for, more, problems, slipping, through, the, cracks, potentially, resulting, in, an, overall, increase, in, bank, failures, across, the, united, states, the, changing, economic, environment, has, a, significant, impact, on, banks, and, thrifts, as, they, struggle, to, effectively, manage, their, interest, rate, spread, in, the, face, of, low, rates, on, loans, rate, competition, for, deposits, and, the, general, market, changes, industry, trends, and, economic, fluctuations, it, has, been, a, challenge, for, banks, to, effectively, set, their, growth, strategies, with, the, recent, economic, market, a, rising, interest, rate, environment, may, seem, to, help, financial, institutions, but, the, effect, of, the, changes, on, consumers, and, businesses, is, not, predictable, and, the, challenge, remains, for, banks, to, grow, and, effectively, manage, the, spread, to, generate, a, return, to, their, shareholders, the, management, of, the, banks, asset, portfolios, also, remains, a, challenge, in, today, s, economic, environment, loans, are, a, bank, s, primary, asset, category, and, when, loan, quality, becomes, suspect, the, foundation, of, a, bank, is, shaken, to, the, core, while, always, an, issue, for, banks, declining, asset, quality, has, become, a, big, problem, for, financial, institutions, there, are, several, reasons, for, this, one, of, which, is, the, lax, attitude, some, banks, have, adopted, because, of, the, years, of, good, times, the, potential, for, this, is, exacerbated, by, the, reduction, in, the, regulatory, oversight, of, banks, and, in, some, cases, depth, of, management, problems, are, more, likely, to, go, undetected, resulting, in, a, significant, impact, on, the, bank, when, they, are, discovered, in, addition, banks, like, any, business, struggle, to, cut, costs, and, have, consequently, eliminated, certain, expenses, such, as, adequate, employee, training, programs, banks, also, face, a, host, of, other, challenges, such, as, ageing, ownership, groups, across, the, country, many, banks, management, teams, and, boards, of, directors, are, ageing, banks, also, face, ongoing, pressure, from, shareholders, both, public, and, private, to, achieve, earnings, and, growth, projections, regulators, place, added, pressure, on, banks, to, manage, the, various, categories, of, risk, banking, is, also, an, extremely, competitive, industry, competing, in, the, financial, services, industry, has, become, tougher, with, the, entrance, of, such, players, as, insurance, agencies, credit, unions, cheque, cashing, services, credit, card, companies, etc, as, a, reaction, banks, have, developed, their, activities, in, financial, instruments, through, financial, market, operations, such, as, brokerage, and, have, become, big, players, in, such, activities, another, major, challenge, is, the, ageing, infrastructure, also, called, legacy, it, backend, systems, were, built, decades, ago, and, are, incompatible, with, new, applications, fixing, bugs, and, creating, interfaces, costs, huge, sums, as, knowledgeable, programmers, become, scarce, to, be, able, to, provide, home, buyers, and, builders, with, the, funds, needed, banks, must, compete, for, deposits, the, phenomenon, of, disintermediation, had, to, dollars, moving, from, savings, accounts, and, into, direct, market, instruments, such, as, u, s, department, of, treasury, obligations, agency, securities, and, corporate, debt, one, of, the, greatest, factors, in, recent, years, in, the, movement, of, deposits, was, the, tremendous, growth, of, money, market, funds, whose, higher, interest, rates, attracted, consumer, deposits, to, compete, for, deposits, us, savings, institutions, offer, many, different, types, of, plans, bank, statements, are, accounting, records, produced, by, banks, under, the, various, accounting, standards, of, the, world, under, gaap, there, are, two, kinds, of, accounts, debit, and, credit, credit, accounts, are, revenue, equity, and, liabilities, debit, accounts, are, assets, and, expenses, the, bank, credits, a, credit, account, to, increase, its, balance, and, debits, a, credit, account, to, decrease, its, balance, the, customer, debits, his, or, her, savings, bank, asset, in, his, ledger, when, making, a, deposit, and, the, account, is, normally, in, debit, while, the, customer, credits, a, credit, card, liability, account, in, his, ledger, every, time, he, spends, money, and, the, account, is, normally, in, credit, when, the, customer, reads, his, bank, statement, the, statement, will, show, a, credit, to, the, account, for, deposits, and, debits, for, withdrawals, of, funds, the, customer, with, a, positive, balance, will, see, this, balance, reflected, as, a, credit, balance, on, the, bank, statement, if, the, customer, is, overdrawn, he, will, have, a, negative, balance, reflected, as, a, debit, balance, on, the, bank, statement, one, source, of, deposits, for, banks, is, deposit, brokers, who, deposit, large, sums, of, money, on, behalf, of, investors, through, trust, corporations, this, money, will, generally, go, to, the, banks, which, offer, the, most, favourable, terms, often, better, than, those, offered, local, depositors, it, is, possible, for, a, bank, to, engage, in, business, with, no, local, deposits, at, all, all, funds, being, brokered, deposits, accepting, a, significant, quantity, of, such, deposits, or, hot, money, as, it, is, sometimes, called, puts, a, bank, in, a, difficult, and, sometimes, risky, position, as, the, funds, must, be, lent, or, invested, in, a, way, that, yields, a, return, sufficient, to, pay, the, high, interest, being, paid, on, the, brokered, deposits, this, may, result, in, risky, decisions, and, even, in, eventual, failure, of, the, bank, banks, which, failed, during, 2008, and, 2009, in, the, united, states, during, the, global, financial, crisis, had, on, average, four, times, more, brokered, deposits, as, a, percent, of, their, deposits, than, the, average, bank, such, deposits, combined, with, risky, real, estate, investments, factored, into, the, savings, and, loan, crisis, of, the, 1980s, regulation, of, brokered, deposits, is, opposed, by, banks, on, the, grounds, that, the, practice, can, be, a, source, of, external, funding, to, growing, communities, with, insufficient, local, deposits, there, are, different, types, of, accounts, saving, recurring, and, current, accounts, custodial, accounts, are, accounts, in, which, assets, are, held, for, a, third, party, for, example, businesses, that, accept, custody, of, funds, for, clients, prior, to, their, conversion, return, or, transfer, may, have, a, custodial, account, at, a, bank,
