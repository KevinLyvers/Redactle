to, train, their, employees, throughout, the, covid, 19, outbreak, across, the, european, union, the, most, commonly, mentioned, investment, barrier, is, the, lack, of, trained, labor, 75, of,

their, counterparts, in, the, united, states, venture, capital, in, the, eu, has, been, historically, lower, amounting, to, only, 0, 3, of, the, eu, s, annual, gdp, this, is, compared, to, almost, 0,

notably, the, baltic, states, have, achieved, high, gdp, growth, with, latvia, topping, 11, close, to, china, the, world, leader, at, 9, on, average, for, the, past, 25, years, though, these, gains, have, been, in, great, part, cancelled, by, the, late, 2000s, recession, reasons, for, this, growth, include, government, commitments, to, stable, monetary, policy, export, oriented, trade, policies, low, flat, tax, rates, and, the, utilisation, of, relatively, cheap, labour, in, 2015, ireland, had, the, highest, gdp, growth, of, all, the, states, in, eu, 25, 1, the, current, map, of, eu, growth, is, one, of, huge, regional, variation, with, the, larger, economies, suffering, from, stagnant, growth, and, most, of, the, newer, states, enjoying, sustained, robust, economic, growth, the, european, union, s, financial, system, is, characterized, by, a, large, banking, sector, with, bank, assets, comprising, 300, of, gdp, compared, to, 85, in, the, united, states, however, the, eu, has, relatively, small, capital, markets, with, listed, equity, making, up, only, 68, of, gdp, compared, to, 170, in, the, united, states, and, a, limited, presence, of, hedge, funds, and, private, equity,

transfers, increased, by, 6, 5, of, gross, income, although, eu27, gdp, is, rising, the, percentage, of, gross, world, product, is, decreasing, because, of, the, emergence, of, economies, such, as, china, india, and, brazil, in, the, tables, below, colours, indicate, best, and, worst, performer, of, the, year, concerned, the, eu, seasonally, adjusted, unemployment, rate, was, 6, 7, in, september, 2018, the, euro, area, unemployment, rate, was, 8, 1, among, the, member, states, the, lowest, unemployment, rates, were, recorded, in, the, czech, republic, 2, 3, germany, and, poland, both, 3, 4, and, the, highest, in, spain, 12, 3, in, 2024, and, greece, 19, 0, in, july, 2018, the, following, table, shows, the, history, of, the, unemployment, rate, for, all, european, union, member, states, the, european, union, is, the, largest, exporter, in, the, world, and, as, of, 2008, the, largest, importer, of, goods, and, services, internal, trade, between, the, member, states, is, aided, by, the, removal, of, barriers, to, trade, such, as, tariffs, and, border, controls, in, the, eurozone, trade, is, helped, by, not, having, any, currency, differences, to, deal, with, amongst, most, members, the, european, union, association, agreement, does, something, similar, for, a, much, larger, range, of, countries, partly, as, a, so, called, soft, approach, a, carrot, instead, of, a, stick, to, influence, the, politics, in, those, countries, the, european, union, represents, all, its, members, at, the, world, trade, organization, wto, and, acts, on, behalf, of,

are, the, countries, with, the, most, exporting, businesses, malta, and, cyprus, have, the, fewest, euro, area, international, trade, in, goods, surplus, 23, 1, bn, 23, 4, bn, surplus, for, eu27, comparing, the, richest, areas, of, the, eu, can, be, a, difficult, task, this, is, because, the, nuts, 1, 2, regions, are, not, homogenous, some, of, them, being, very, large, regions, such, as, nuts, 1, hesse, 21, 100, km, 2, or, nuts, 1, le, de, france, 12, 011, km, 2, whilst, other, nuts, regions, are, much, smaller, for, example, nuts, 1, hamburg, 755, km, 2, an, extreme, example, is, finland, which, is, divided, for, historical, reasons, into, mainland, finland, with, 5, 3, million, inhabitants, and, land, an, autonomous, archipelago, with, a, population, of, 27, 000, or, about, the, population, of, a, small, finnish, city, one, problem, with, this, data, is, that, some, areas, are, subject, to, a, large, number, of, commuters, coming, into, the, area, thereby, artificially, inflating, the, figures, it, has, the, effect, of, raising, gdp, but, not, altering, the, number, of, people, living, in, the, area, inflating, the, gdp, per, capita, figure, similar, problems, can, be, produced, by, a, large, number, of, tourists, visiting, the, area, the, data, is, used, to, define, regions, that, are, supported, with, financial, aid, in, programs, such, as, the, european, regional, development, fund, the, decision, to, delineate, a, nomenclature, of, territorial, units, for, statistics, nuts, region, is, to, a, large, extent, arbitrary, i, e, not, based, on, objective, and, uniform, criteria, across, europe, and, is, decided, at, european, level, see, also, regions, of, the, european, union, the, top, 10, nuts, 1, and, nuts, 2, regions, with, the, highest, gdp, per, capita, are, almost, all, except, one, in, the, first, fifteen, member, states, prague, is, the, only, one, in, the, 13, new, member, states, that, joined, in, may, 2004, january, 2007, and, july, 2013, the, leading, regions, in, the, ranking, of, nuts, 2, regional, gdp, per, inhabitant, in, 2019, were, the, grand, duchy, of, luxembourg, 260, the, southern, region, of, ireland, 240, and, prague, czech, republic, 205, figures, for, these, three, regions, however, were, artificially, inflated, by, the, commuters, who, do, not, reside, in, these, regions, net, commuter, inflows, in, these, regions, push, up, production, to, a, level, that, could, not, be, achieved, by, the, resident, active, population, on, its, own, the, result, is, that, gdp, per, inhabitant, appears, to, be, overestimated, in, these, regions, and, underestimated, in, regions, with, commuter, outflows, another, example, of, artificial, inflation, is, groningen, the, calculated, gdp, per, capita, is, very, high, because, of, the, large, natural, gas, reserves, in, this, region, but, groningen, is, one, of, the, poorest, parts, in, the, netherlands, among, the, 16, nuts, 2, regions, exceeding, the, 160, level, in, 2020, two, were, in, belgium, germany, ireland, and, the, netherlands, and, one, each, in, the, czech, republic, denmark, france, poland, romania, slovakia, and, sweden, as, well, as, in,
