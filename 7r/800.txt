biological, families, the, parents, may, be, deceased, absent, or, abusive, there, may, be, substance, abuse, or, mental, illness, in, the, biological, home, or, the, parent, may, simply, be, unwilling, to, care, for, the, child, the, legal, responsibility, for, the, support, of, abandoned, children, differs, from, country, to, country, and, within, countries, government, run, orphanages, have, been, phased, out, in, most, developed, countries, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, but, continue, to, operate, in, many, other, regions, internationally, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, orphanages, are, detrimental, to, the, emotional, wellbeing, of, children, and, government, support, goes, instead, towards, supporting, the, family, unit, a, few, large, international, charities, continue, to, fund, orphanages, but, most, are, still, commonly, founded, by, smaller, charities, and, religious, groups, especially, in, developing, countries, orphanages, may, prey, on, vulnerable, families, at, risk, of, breakdown, and, actively, recruit, children, to, ensure, continued, funding, orphanages, in, developing, countries, are, rarely, run, by, the, state, however, not, all, orphanages, that, are, state, run, are, less, corrupted, the, romanian, orphanages, like, those, in, bucharest, were, founded, due, to, the, soaring, population, numbers, catalyzed, by, dictator, nicolae, ceau, escu, who, banned, abortion, and, birth, control, and, incentivized, procreation, in, order, to, increase, the, romanian, workforce, today, s, residential, institutions, for, children, also, described, as, congregate, care, include, group, homes, residential, child, care, communities, children, s, homes, refuges, rehabilitation, centers, night, shelters, and, youth, treatment, centers, the, romans, formed, their, first, orphanages, around, 400, ad, jewish, law, prescribed, care, for, the, widow, and, the, orphan, and, athenian, law, supported, all, orphans, of, those, killed, in, military, service, until, the, age, of, eighteen, plato, laws, 927, says, orphans, should, be, placed, under, the, care, of, public, guardians, men, should, have, a, fear, of, the, loneliness, of, orphans, and, of, the, souls, of, their, departed, parents, a, man, should, love, the, unfortunate, orphan, of, whom, he, is, guardian, as, if, he, were, his, own, child, he, should, be, as, careful, and, as, diligent, in, the, management, of, the, orphan, s, property, as, of, his, own, or, even, more, careful, still, the, care, of, orphans, was, referred, to, bishops, and, during, the, middle, ages, to, monasteries, as, soon, as, they, were, old, enough, children, were, often, given, as, apprentices, to, households, to, ensure, their, support, and, to, learn, an, occupation, in, medieval, europe, care, for, orphans, tended, to, reside, with, the, church, the, elizabethan, poor, laws, were, enacted, at, the, time, of, the, reformation, and, placed, public, responsibility, on, individual, parishes, to, care, for, the, indigent, poor, the, growth, of, sentimental, philanthropy, in, the, 18th, century, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, first, charitable, institutions, that, would, cater, to, orphans, the, foundling, hospital, was, founded, in, 1741, by, the, philanthropic, sea, captain, thomas, coram, in, london, england, as, a, children, s, home, for, the, education, and, maintenance, of, exposed, and, deserted, young, children, the, first, children, were, admitted, into, a, temporary, house, located, in, hatton, garden, at, first, no, questions, were, asked, about, child, or, parent, but, a, distinguishing, token, was, put, on, each, child, by, the, parent, on, reception, children, were, sent, to, wet, nurses, in, the, countryside, where, they, stayed, until, they, were, about, four, or, five, years, old, at, sixteen, girls, were, generally, apprenticed, as, servants, for, four, years, at, fourteen, boys, were, apprenticed, into, a, variety, of, occupations, typically, for, seven, years, there, was, a, small, benevolent, fund, for, adults, in, 1756, the, house, of, commons, resolved, that, all, children, offered, should, be, received, that, local, receiving, places, should, be, appointed, all, over, the, country, and, that, the, funds, should, be, publicly, guaranteed, a, basket, was, accordingly, hung, outside, the, hospital, the, maximum, age, for, admission, was, raised, from, two, months, to, twelve, and, a, flood, of, children, poured, in, from, country, workhouses, parliament, soon, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, indiscriminate, admission, should, be, discontinued, the, hospital, adopted, a, system, of, receiving, children, only, with, considerable, sums, this, practice, was, finally, stopped, in, 1801, and, it, henceforth, became, a, fundamental, rule, that, no, money, was, to, be, received, by, the, early, nineteenth, century, the, problem, of, abandoned, children, in, urban, areas, especially, london, began, to, reach, alarming, proportions, the, workhouse, system, instituted, in, 1834, although, often, brutal, was, an, attempt, at, the, time, to, house, orphans, as, well, as, other, vulnerable, people, in, society, who, could, not, support, themselves, in, exchange, for, work, conditions, especially, for, the, women, and, children, were, so, bad, as, to, cause, an, outcry, among, the, social, reform, minded, middle, class, some, of, charles, dickens, most, famous, novels, including, oliver, twist, highlighted, the, plight, of, the, vulnerable, and, the, often, abusive, conditions, that, were, prevalent, in, the, london, orphanages, clamour, for, change, led, to, the, birth, of, the, orphanage, movement, in, england, the, movement, really, took, off, in, the, mid, 19th, century, although, orphanages, such, as, the, orphan, working, home, in, 1758, and, the, bristol, asylum, for, poor, orphan, girls, in, 1795, had, been, set, up, earlier, private, orphanages, were, founded, by, private, benefactors, these, often, received, royal, patronage, and, government, oversight, ragged, schools, founded, by, john, pounds, and, the, lord, shaftesbury, were, also, set, up, to, provide, pauper, children, with, basic, education, orphanages, were, also, set, up, in, the, united, states, from, the, early, 19th, century, for, example, in, 1806, the, first, private, orphanage, in, new, york, the, orphan, asylum, society, now, graham, windham, was, co, founded, by, elizabeth, schuyler, hamilton, widow, of, alexander, hamilton, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, under, the, influence, of, charles, loring, brace, foster, care, became, a, popular, alternative, from, the, mid, 19th, century, later, the, social, security, act, of, 1935, improved, conditions, by, authorizing, aid, to, families, with, dependent, children, as, a, form, of, social, security, a, very, influential, philanthropist, of, the, era, was, thomas, john, barnardo, the, founder, of, the, charity, barnardos, becoming, aware, of, the, great, numbers, of, homeless, and, destitute, children, adrift, in, the, cities, of, england, and, encouraged, by, the, 7th, earl, of, shaftesbury, and, the, 1st, earl, cairns, he, opened, the, first, of, the, dr, barnardo, s, homes, in, 1870, by, his, death, in, 1905, he, had, established, 112, district, homes, which, searched, for, and, received, waifs, and, strays, to, feed, clothe, and, educate, them, the, system, under, which, the, institution, was, carried, on, is, broad, as, follows, the, infants, and, younger, girls, and, boys, were, chiefly, boarded, out, in, rural, districts, girls, above, fourteen, years, of, age, were, sent, to, the, industrial, training, homes, to, be, taught, useful, domestic, occupations, boys, above, seventeen, years, of, age, were, first, tested, in, labor, homes, and, then, placed, in, employment, at, home, sent, to, sea, or, emigrated, boys, of, between, thirteen, and, seventeen, years, of, age, were, trained, for, the, various, trades, for, which, they, might, be, mentally, or, physically, fitted, evidence, from, a, variety, of, studies, supports, the, vital, importance, of, attachment, security, and, later, development, of, children, deinstitutionalization, of, orphanages, and, children, s, homes, program, in, the, united, states, began, in, the, 1950s, after, a, series, of, scandals, involving, the, coercion, of, birth, parents, and, abuse, of, orphans, notably, at, georgia, tann, s, tennessee, children, s, home, society, in, romania, a, decree, was, established, that, aggressively, promoted, population, growth, banning, contraception, and, abortions, for, women, with, fewer, than, four, children, despite, the, wretched, poverty, of, most, families, after, ceausescu, was, overthrown, he, left, a, society, unable, and, unwilling, to, take, care, of, its, children, researchers, conducted, a, study, to, see, what, the, implications, of, this, early, childhood, neglect, were, on, development, typically, reared, romanian, children, showed, high, rates, of, secure, attachment, whereas, the, institutionally, raised, children, showed, huge, rates, of, disorganized, attachment, many, countries, accepted, the, need, to, de, institutionalize, the, care, of, vulnerable, children, that, is, close, down, orphanages, in, favor, of, foster, care, and, accelerated, adoption, foster, care, operates, by, taking, in, children, from, their, homes, due, to, the, lack, of, care, or, abuse, of, their, parents, where, orphanages, take, in, children, with, no, parents, or, children, whose, parents, have, dropped, them, off, for, a, better, life, typically, due, to, income, major, charities, are, increasingly, focusing, their, efforts, on, the, re, integration, of, orphans, in, order, to, keep, them, with, their, parents, or, extended, family, and, communities, orphanages, are, no, longer, common, in, the, european, community, and, romania, in, particular, has, struggled, greatly, to, reduce, the, visibility, of, its, children, s, institutions, to, meet, conditions, of, its, entry, into, the, european, union, some, have, stated, it, is, important, to, understand, the, reasons, for, child, abandonment, then, set, up, targeted, alternative, services, to, support, vulnerable, families, at, risk, of, separation, such, as, mother, and, baby, units, and, day, care, centres, research, from, the, bucharest, early, intervention, project, beip, is, often, cited, as, demonstrating, that, residential, institutions, negatively, impact, the, wellbeing, of, children, the, beip, selected, orphanages, in, bucharest, romania, that, raised, abandoned, children, in, socially, and, emotionally, deprived, environments, in, order, to, study, the, changes, in, development, of, infants, and, children, after, they, had, been, placed, with, specially, trained, foster, families, in, the, local, community, this, study, demonstrated, how, the, loving, attention, typically, provided, to, children, by, their, parents, or, caregivers, is, pivotal, for, optimal, human, development, specifically, of, the, brain, adequate, nutrition, is, not, enough, further, research, of, children, who, were, adopted, from, institutions, in, eastern, european, countries, to, the, us, demonstrated, that, for, every, 3, 5, months, that, an, infant, spent, in, the, institution, they, lagged, behind, their, peers, in, growth, by, 1, month, further, a, meta, analysis, of, research, on, the, iqs, of, children, in, orphanages, found, lower, iqs, among, the, children, in, many, institutions, but, this, result, was, not, found, in, the, low, income, country, setting, worldwide, residential, institutions, like, orphanages, can, often, be, detrimental, to, the, psychological, development, of, affected, children, in, countries, where, orphanages, are, no, longer, in, use, the, long, term, care, of, unwarded, children, by, the, state, has, been, transitioned, to, a, domestic, environment, with, an, emphasis, on, replicating, a, family, home, many, of, these, countries, such, as, the, united, states, utilize, a, system, of, monetary, stipends, paid, to, foster, parents, to, incentivize, and, subsidize, the, care, of, state, wards, in, private, homes, a, distinction, must, be, made, between, foster, care, and, adoption, as, adoption, would, remove, the, child, from, the, care, of, the, state, and, transfer, the, legal, responsibility, for, that, child, s, care, to, the, adoptive, parent, completely, and, irrevocably, whereas, in, the, case, of, foster, care, the, child, would, remain, a, ward, of, the, state, with, the, foster, parent, acting, only, as, a, caregiver, orphanages, especially, larger, ones, have, had, some, well, publicised, examples, of, poor, care, in, large, institutions, children, but, particularly, babies, may, not, receive, enough, eye, contact, physical, contact, and, stimulation, to, promote, proper, physical, social, or, cognitive, development, in, the, worst, cases, orphanages, can, be, dangerous, and, unregulated, places, where, children, are, subject, to, abuse, and, neglect, children, living, in, orphanages, for, prolonged, periods, get, behind, in, development, goals, and, have, worse, mental, health, orphanage, children, are, not, included, in, statistics, making, it, easy, to, traffic, them, or, abuse, them, in, other, ways, there, are, campaigns, to, include, orphanage, children, and, street, children, in, progress, statistics, the, benefit, of, foster, care, over, orphanages, is, disputed, one, significant, study, carried, out, by, duke, university, concluded, that, institutional, care, in, america, in, the, 20th, century, produced, the, same, health, emotional, intellectual, mental, and, physical, outcomes, as, care, by, relatives, and, better, than, care, in, the, homes, of, strangers, one, explanation, for, this, is, the, prevalence, of, permanent, temporary, foster, care, this, is, the, name, for, a, long, string, of, short, stays, with, different, foster, care, families, permanent, temporary, foster, care, is, highly, disruptive, to, the, child, and, prevents, the, child, from, developing, a, sense, of, security, or, belonging, placement, in, the, home, of, a, relative, maintains, and, usually, improves, the, child, s, connection, to, family, members, experts, and, child, advocates, maintain, that, orphanages, are, expensive, and, often, harm, children, s, development, by, separating, them, from, their, families, and, that, it, would, be, more, effective, and, cheaper, to, aid, close, relatives, who, want, to, take, in, the, orphans, another, alternative, is, group, homes, which, are, used, for, short, term, placements, they, may, be, residential, treatment, centers, and, they, frequently, specialize, in, a, particular, population, with, psychiatric, or, behavioral, problems, e, g, a, group, home, for, children, and, teens, with, autism, eating, disorders, or, substance, abuse, problems, or, child, soldiers, undergoing, decommissioning, most, children, who, live, in, orphanages, are, not, orphans, four, out, of, five, children, in, orphanages, have, at, least, one, living, parent, and, most, having, some, extended, family, developing, countries, and, their, governments, rely, on, kinship, care, to, aid, in, the, orphan, crisis, because, it, is, cheaper, to, financially, help, extended, families, in, taking, in, an, orphaned, child, than, it, is, to, institutionalize, them, while, many, orphanages, are, run, as, not, for, profit, institutions, some, orphanages, are, run, as, for, profit, ventures, this, has, been, criticized, as, incentivizing, against, the, welfare, of, the, orphans, most, of, the, children, living, in, institutions, around, the, world, have, a, surviving, parent, or, close, relative, and, they, most, commonly, entered, orphanages, because, of, poverty, it, is, speculated, that, flush, with, money, orphanages, are, increasing, and, push, for, children, to, join, even, though, demographic, data, show, that, even, the, poorest, extended, families, usually, take, in, children, whose, parents, have, died, visitors, to, developing, countries, can, be, taken, in, by, orphanage, scams, which, can, include, orphanages, set, up, as, a, front, to, get, foreigners, to, pay, school, fees, of, orphanage, directors, extended, families, alternatively, the, children, whose, upkeep, is, being, funded, by, foreigners, may, be, sent, to, work, not, to, school, the, exact, opposite, of, what, the, donor, is, expecting, the, worst, even, sell, children, in, cambodia, from, 2005, to, 2017, the, number, of, orphanages, increased, by, 75, with, many, of, these, orphanages, renting, children, from, poor, families, for, 25, month, families, are, promised, that, their, children, can, get, free, education, and, food, here, but, what, really, happens, is, that, they, are, used, as, props, to, garner, donations, some, are, also, bought, from, their, parents, for, very, little, and, passed, on, to, westerners, who, pay, a, large, fee, to, adopt, them, this, also, happens, in, china, in, nepal, orphanages, can, be, used, as, a, way, to, remove, a, child, from, their, parents, before, placing, them, for, adoption, overseas, which, is, equally, lucrative, to, the, owners, who, receive, a, number, of, official, and, unofficial, payments, and, donations, in, other, countries, such, as, indonesia, orphanages, are, run, as, businesses, which, will, attract, donations, and, make, the, owners, rich, often, the, conditions, orphans, are, kept, in, will, deliberately, be, poor, to, attract, more, donations, developing, nations, are, lacking, in, child, welfare, and, their, well, being, because, of, a, lack, of, resources, research, that, is, being, collected, in, the, developing, world, shows, that, these, countries, focus, purely, on, survival, indicators, instead, of, a, combination, of, their, survival, and, other, positive, indicators, like, a, developed, nation, would, do, the, orphanages, and, institutions, remaining, in, europe, tend, to, be, in, eastern, europe, and, are, generally, state, funded, there, are, estimated, to, be, about, 31, 000, orphans, 0, 14, years, old, in, albanian, orphanages, 2012, statistics, in, most, cases, they, were, abandoned, by, their, parents, at, 14, they, are, required, by, law, to, leave, their, orphanage, and, live, on, their, own, there, are, approximately, 10, small, orphanages, in, albania, each, one, having, only, 12, 40, children, residing, there, the, larger, ones, would, be, state, run, sos, children, s, villages, giving, support, to, 240, orphaned, children, the, bulgarian, government, has, shown, interest, in, strengthening, children, s, rights, in, 2010, bulgaria, adopted, a, national, strategic, plan, for, the, period, 2010, 2025, to, improve, the, living, standards, of, the, country, s, children, bulgaria, is, working, hard, to, get, all, institutions, closed, within, the, next, few, years, and, find, alternative, ways, to, take, care, of, the, children, support, is, sporadically, given, to, poor, families, and, work, during, daytime, correspondingly, different, kinds, of, day, centers, have, started, up, though, the, quality, of, care, in, these, centers, is, poorly, measured, and, difficult, to, monitor, a, smaller, number, of, children, have, also, been, able, to, be, relocated, into, foster, families, there, are, 7000, children, living, in, bulgarian, orphanages, wrongly, classified, as, orphaned, only, 10, percent, of, these, are, orphans, with, the, rest, of, the, children, placed, in, orphanages, for, temporary, periods, when, the, family, is, in, crisis, as, of, 2009, there, are, 35, different, orphanages, a, comprehensive, national, strategy, for, strengthening, the, rights, of, children, was, adopted, by, parliament, in, 2007, and, will, run, until, 2032, child, flow, to, orphanages, has, been, stopped, and, children, are, now, protected, by, social, services, violation, of, children, s, rights, leads, to, litigation, in, lithuania, there, are, 105, institutions, 41, percent, of, the, institutions, each, have, more, than, 60, children, lithuania, has, the, highest, number, of, orphaned, children, in, northern, europe, children, s, rights, enjoy, relatively, strong, protection, in, poland, orphaned, children, are, now, protected, by, social, services, social, workers, opportunities, have, increased, by, establishing, more, foster, homes, and, aggressive, family, members, can, now, be, forced, away, from, home, instead, of, replacing, the, child, children, more, than, 8800, children, are, being, raised, in, state, institutions, but, only, three, percent, of, them, are, orphans, the, romanian, child, welfare, system, is, in, the, process, of, being, revised, and, has, reduced, the, flow, of, infants, into, orphanages, according, to, baroness, emma, nicholson, in, some, counties, romania, now, has, a, completely, new, world, class, state, of, the, art, child, health, development, policy, dickensian, orphanages, remain, in, romania, but, romania, seeks, to, replace, institutions, by, family, care, services, as, children, in, need, will, be, protected, by, social, services, as, of, 2018, there, were, 17, 718, children, in, old, style, residential, centers, a, significant, decrease, from, about, 100, 000, in, 1990, there, are, many, state, orphanages, where, several, thousand, children, are, kept, and, which, are, still, part, of, an, outdated, child, care, system, the, conditions, for, them, are, bad, because, the, government, does, not, pay, enough, attention, in, improving, the, living, standards, for, disabled, children, in, serbia, s, orphanages, and, medical, institutions, the, committee, made, recommendations, such, as, proposals, for, the, adoption, of, a, new, national, 14, action, plan, for, children, for, at, least, the, next, five, years, and, the, creation, of, an, independent, institution, for, the, protection, of, child, rights, one, of, the, first, orphanages, in, sweden, was, the, stora, barnhuset, 1633, 1922, in, stockholm, which, remained, the, biggest, orphanage, in, sweden, for, centuries, in, 1785, however, a, reform, by, gustav, iii, of, sweden, stipulated, that, orphans, should, first, and, foremost, always, be, placed, in, foster, homes, when, that, was, possible, in, sweden, there, are, 5, 000, children, in, the, care, of, the, state, none, of, them, are, currently, living, in, an, orphanage, because, there, is, a, social, service, law, which, requires, that, the, children, reside, in, a, family, home, during, the, victorian, era, child, abandonment, was, rampant, and, orphanages, were, set, up, to, reduce, infant, mortality, such, places, were, often, so, full, of, children, that, nurses, often, administered, godfrey, s, cordial, a, special, concoction, of, opium, and, treacle, to, soothe, baby, colic, orphaned, children, were, placed, in, either, prisons, or, the, poorhouse, workhouse, as, there, were, so, few, places, in, orphanages, or, else, they, were, left, to, fend, for, themselves, on, the, street, such, openings, in, orphanages, as, were, available, could, only, be, obtained, by, collecting, votes, for, admission, placing, them, out, of, reach, of, poor, families, known, orphanages, are, the, majority, of, african, orphanages, especially, in, sub, saharan, africa, appear, to, be, funded, by, donors, often, from, western, nations, rather, than, by, domestic, governments, for, example, in, the, jerusalem, association, children, s, home, jach, only, 160, children, remain, of, the, 785, who, were, in, jach, s, three, orphanages, attitudes, regarding, the, institutional, care, of, children, have, shifted, dramatically, in, recent, years, in, ethiopia, there, appears, to, be, a, general, recognition, by, molsa, and, the, ngos, with, which, pact, is, working, that, such, care, is, at, best, a, last, resort, and, that, serious, problems, arise, with, the, social, reintegration, of, children, who, grow, up, in, institutions, and, deinstitutionalization, through, family, reunification, and, independent, living, are, being, emphasized, a, 2007, survey, sponsored, by, oafrica, previously, orphanaid, africa, and, carried, out, by, the, department, of, social, welfare, came, up, with, the, figure, of, 4, 800, children, in, institutional, care, in, 148, orphanages, the, government, is, currently, attempting, to, phase, out, the, use, of, orphanages, in, favor, of, foster, care, placements, and, adoption, at, least, eighty, eight, homes, have, been, closed, since, the, passage, of, the, national, plan, of, action, for, orphans, and, vulnerable, children, the, website, www, ovcghana, org, details, these, reforms, a, 1999, survey, of, 36, 000, orphans, found, the, following, number, in, institutional, care, 64, in, registered, institutions, and, 164, in, unregistered, institutions, there, are, about, 101, orphanages, in, malawi, there, is, a, unicef, government, driven, program, on, de, institutionalization, but, few, orphanages, are, yet, involved, in, the, program, out, of, 400, 000, orphans, 5, 000, are, living, in, orphanages, the, government, of, rwanda, are, working, with, hope, and, homes, for, children, to, close, the, first, institution, and, develop, a, model, for, community, based, childcare, which, can, be, used, across, the, country, and, ultimately, africa, currently, there, are, 52, orphanages, in, tanzania, caring, for, about, 3, 000, orphans, and, vulnerable, children, a, world, bank, document, on, tanzania, showed, it, was, six, times, more, expensive, to, institutionalize, a, child, there, than, to, help, the, family, become, functional, and, support, the, child, themselves, in, nigeria, a, rapid, assessment, of, orphans, and, vulnerable, children, conducted, in, 2004, with, unicef, support, revealed, that, there,
