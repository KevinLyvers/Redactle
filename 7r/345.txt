https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word
a, word, is, a, basic, element, of, language, that, carries, meaning, can, be, used, on, its, own, and, is, uninterruptible, despite, the, fact, that, language, speakers, often, have, an, intuitive, grasp, of, what, a, word, is, there, is, no, consensus, among, linguists, on, its, definition, and, numerous, attempts, to, find, specific, criteria, of, the, concept, remain, controversial, different, standards, have, been, proposed, depending, on, the, theoretical, background, and, descriptive, context, these, do, not, converge, on, a, single, definition, 13, 618, some, specific, definitions, of, the, term, word, are, employed, to, convey, its, different, meanings, at, different, levels, of, description, for, example, based, on, phonological, grammatical, or, orthographic, basis, others, suggest, that, the, concept, is, simply, a, convention, used, in, everyday, situations, 6, the, concept, of, word, is, distinguished, from, that, of, a, morpheme, which, is, the, smallest, unit, of, language, that, has, a, meaning, even, if, it, cannot, stand, on, its, own, words, are, made, out, of, at, least, one, morpheme, morphemes, can, also, be, joined, to, create, other, words, in, a, process, of, morphological, derivation, 768, in, english, and, many, other, languages, the, morphemes, that, make, up, a, word, generally, include, at, least, one, root, such, as, rock, god, type, writ, can, not, and, possibly, some, affixes, s, un, ly, ness, words, with, more, than, one, root, er, s, ically, are, called, compound, words, in, turn, words, are, combined, to, form, other, elements, of, language, such, as, phrases, a, red, rock, put, up, with, clauses, i, threw, a, rock, and, sentences, i, threw, a, rock, but, missed, in, many, languages, the, notion, of, what, constitutes, a, word, may, be, learned, as, part, of, learning, the, writing, system, this, is, the, case, for, the, english, language, and, for, most, languages, that, are, written, with, alphabets, derived, from, the, ancient, latin, or, greek, alphabets, in, english, orthography, the, letter, sequences, rock, god, write, with, the, and, not, are, considered, to, be, single, morpheme, words, whereas, rocks, ungodliness, typewriter, and, cannot, are, words, composed, of, two, or, more, morphemes, rock, s, un, god, li, ness, type, writ, er, and, can, not, since, the, beginning, of, the, study, of, linguistics, numerous, attempts, at, defining, what, a, word, is, have, been, made, with, many, different, criteria, however, no, satisfying, definition, has, yet, been, found, to, apply, to, all, languages, and, at, all, levels, of, linguistic, analysis, it, is, however, possible, to, find, consistent, definitions, of, word, at, different, levels, of, description, 6, these, include, definitions, on, the, phonetic, and, phonological, level, that, it, is, the, smallest, segment, of, sound, that, can, be, theoretically, isolated, by, word, accent, and, boundary, markers, on, the, orthographic, level, as, a, segment, indicated, by, blank, spaces, in, writing, or, print, on, the, basis, of, morphology, as, the, basic, element, of, grammatical, paradigms, like, inflection, different, from, word, forms, within, semantics, as, the, smallest, and, relatively, independent, carrier, of, meaning, in, a, lexicon, and, syntactically, as, the, smallest, permutable, and, substitutable, unit, of, a, sentence, 1285, in, some, languages, these, different, types, of, words, coincide, and, one, can, analyze, for, example, a, phonological, word, as, essentially, the, same, as, grammatical, word, however, in, other, languages, they, may, correspond, to, elements, of, different, size, 1, much, of, the, difficulty, stems, from, the, eurocentric, bias, as, languages, from, outside, of, europe, may, not, follow, the, intuitions, of, european, scholars, some, of, the, criteria, developed, for, word, can, only, be, applicable, to, languages, of, broadly, european, synthetic, structure, 1, 3, because, of, this, unclear, status, some, linguists, propose, avoiding, the, term, word, altogether, instead, focusing, on, better, defined, terms, such, as, morphemes, dictionaries, categorize, a, language, s, lexicon, into, individually, listed, forms, called, lemmas, these, can, be, taken, as, an, indication, of, what, constitutes, a, word, in, the, opinion, of, the, writers, of, that, language, this, written, form, of, a, word, constitutes, a, lexeme, 670, 671, the, most, appropriate, means, of, measuring, the, length, of, a, word, is, by, counting, its, syllables, or, morphemes, when, a, word, has, multiple, definitions, or, multiple, senses, it, may, result, in, confusion, in, a, debate, or, discussion, one, distinguishable, meaning, of, the, term, word, can, be, defined, on, phonological, grounds, it, is, a, unit, larger, or, equal, to, a, syllable, which, can, be, distinguished, based, on, segmental, or, prosodic, features, or, through, its, interactions, with, phonological, rules, in, walmatjari, an, australian, language, roots, or, suffixes, may, have, only, one, syllable, but, a, phonologic, word, must, have, at, least, two, syllables, a, disyllabic, verb, root, may, take, a, zero, suffix, e, g, luwa, hit, but, a, monosyllabic, root, must, take, a, suffix, e, g, ya, nta, go, thus, conforming, to, a, segmental, pattern, of, walmatjari, words, in, the, pitjantjatjara, dialect, of, the, wati, language, another, language, form, australia, a, word, medial, syllable, can, end, with, a, consonant, but, a, word, final, syllable, must, end, with, a, vowel, 14, in, most, languages, stress, may, serve, a, criterion, for, a, phonological, word, in, languages, with, a, fixed, stress, it, is, possible, to, ascertain, word, boundaries, from, its, location, although, it, is, impossible, to, predict, word, boundaries, from, stress, alone, in, languages, with, phonemic, stress, there, will, be, just, one, syllable, with, primary, stress, per, word, which, allows, for, determining, the, total, number, of, words, in, an, utterance, 16, many, phonological, rules, operate, only, within, a, phonological, word, or, specifically, across, word, boundaries, in, hungarian, dental, consonants, d, t, l, or, n, assimilate, to, a, following, semi, vowel, j, yielding, the, corresponding, palatal, sound, but, only, within, one, word, conversely, external, sandhi, rules, act, across, word, boundaries, the, prototypical, example, of, this, rule, comes, from, sanskrit, however, initial, consonant, mutation, in, contemporary, celtic, languages, or, the, linking, r, phenomenon, in, some, non, rhotic, english, dialects, can, also, be, used, to, illustrate, word, boundaries, 17, it, is, often, the, case, that, a, phonological, word, does, not, correspond, to, our, intuitive, conception, of, a, word, the, finnish, compound, word, p, kaupunki, capital, is, phonologically, two, words, p, head, and, kaupunki, city, because, it, does, not, conform, to, finnish, patterns, of, vowel, harmony, within, words, conversely, a, single, phonological, word, may, be, made, up, of, more, than, one, syntactical, elements, such, as, in, the, english, phrase, i, ll, come, where, i, ll, forms, one, phonological, word, 13, 618, a, word, can, be, thought, of, as, an, item, in, a, speaker, s, internal, lexicon, this, is, called, a, lexeme, however, this, may, be, different, from, the, meaning, in, everyday, speech, of, word, since, one, lexeme, includes, all, inflected, forms, the, lexeme, teapot, refers, to, the, singular, teapot, as, well, as, the, plural, teapots, there, is, also, the, question, to, what, extent, should, inflected, or, compounded, words, be, included, in, a, lexeme, especially, in, agglutinative, languages, for, example, there, is, little, doubt, that, in, turkish, the, lexeme, for, house, should, include, nominative, singular, ev, and, plural, evler, however, it, is, not, clear, if, it, should, also, encompass, the, word, evlerinizden, from, your, houses, formed, through, regular, suffixation, there, are, also, lexemes, such, as, black, and, white, or, do, it, yourself, which, although, consisting, of, multiple, words, still, form, a, single, collocation, with, a, set, meaning, 13, 618, grammatical, words, are, proposed, to, consist, of, a, number, of, grammatical, elements, which, occur, together, not, in, separate, places, within, a, clause, in, a, fixed, order, and, have, a, set, meaning, however, there, are, exceptions, to, all, of, these, criteria, 19, single, grammatical, words, have, a, fixed, internal, structure, when, the, structure, is, changed, the, meaning, of, the, word, also, changes, in, dyirbal, which, can, use, many, derivational, affixes, with, its, nouns, there, are, the, dual, suffix, jarran, and, the, suffix, gabun, meaning, another, with, the, noun, yibi, they, can, be, arranged, into, yibi, jarran, gabun, another, two, women, or, yibi, gabun, jarran, two, other, women, but, changing, the, suffix, order, also, changes, their, meaning, speakers, of, a, language, also, usually, associate, a, specific, meaning, with, a, word, and, not, a, single, morpheme, for, example, when, asked, to, talk, about, untruthfulness, they, rarely, focus, on, the, meaning, of, morphemes, such, as, th, or, ness, 19, 20, leonard, bloomfield, introduced, the, concept, of, minimal, free, forms, in, 1928, words, are, thought, of, as, the, smallest, meaningful, unit, of, speech, that, can, stand, by, themselves, 11, this, correlates, phonemes, units, of, sound, to, lexemes, units, of, meaning, however, some, written, words, are, not, minimal, free, forms, as, they, make, no, sense, by, themselves, for, example, the, and, of, 77, some, semanticists, have, put, forward, a, theory, of, so, called, semantic, primitives, or, semantic, primes, indefinable, words, representing, fundamental, concepts, that, are, intuitively, meaningful, according, to, this, theory, semantic, primes, serve, as, the, basis, for, describing, the, meaning, without, circularity, of, other, words, and, their, associated, conceptual, denotations, in, the, minimalist, school, of, theoretical, syntax, words, also, called, lexical, items, in, the, literature, are, construed, as, bundles, of, linguistic, features, that, are, united, into, a, structure, with, form, and, meaning, 36, 37, for, example, the, word, koalas, has, semantic, features, it, denotes, real, world, objects, koalas, category, features, it, is, a, noun, number, features, it, is, plural, and, must, agree, with, verbs, pronouns, and, demonstratives, in, its, domain, phonological, features, it, is, pronounced, a, certain, way, etc, in, languages, with, a, literary, tradition, the, question, of, what, is, considered, a, single, word, is, influenced, by, orthography, word, separators, typically, spaces, and, punctuation, marks, are, common, in, modern, orthography, of, languages, using, alphabetic, scripts, but, these, are, a, relatively, modern, development, in, the, history, of, writing, in, character, encoding, word, segmentation, depends, on, which, characters, are, defined, as, word, dividers, in, english, orthography, compound, expressions, may, contain, spaces, for, example, ice, cream, air, raid, shelter, and, get, up, each, are, generally, considered, to, consist, of, more, than, one, word, as, each, of, the, components, are, free, forms, with, the, possible, exception, of, get, and, so, is, no, one, but, the, similarly, compounded, someone, and, nobody, are, considered, single, words, sometimes, languages, which, are, close, grammatically, will, consider, the, same, order, of, words, in, different, ways, for, example, reflexive, verbs, in, the, french, infinitive, are, separate, from, their, respective, particle, e, g, se, laver, to, wash, oneself, whereas, in, portuguese, they, are, hyphenated, e, g, lavar, se, and, in, spanish, they, are, joined, e, g, lavarse, not, all, languages, delimit, words, expressly, mandarin, chinese, is, a, highly, analytic, language, with, few, inflectional, affixes, making, it, unnecessary, to, delimit, words, orthographically, however, there, are, many, multiple, morpheme, compounds, in, mandarin, as, well, as, a, variety, of, bound, morphemes, that, make, it, difficult, to, clearly, determine, what, constitutes, a, word, 56, japanese, uses, orthographic, cues, to, delimit, words, such, as, switching, between, kanji, characters, borrowed, from, chinese, writing, and, the, two, kana, syllabaries, this, is, a, fairly, soft, rule, because, content, words, can, also, be, written, in, hiragana, for, effect, though, if, done, extensively, spaces, are, typically, added, to, maintain, legibility, vietnamese, orthography, although, using, the, latin, alphabet, delimits, monosyllabic, morphemes, rather, than, words, the, task, of, defining, what, constitutes, a, word, involves, determining, where, one, word, ends, and, another, begins, there, are, several, methods, for, identifying, word, boundaries, present, in, speech, morphology, is, the, study, of, word, formation, and, structure, words, may, undergo, different, morphological, processes, which, are, traditionally, classified, into, two, broad, groups, derivation, and, inflection, derivation, is, a, process, in, which, a, new, word, is, created, from, existing, ones, with, an, adjustment, to, its, meaning, and, often, with, a, change, of, word, class, for, example, in, english, the, verb, to, convert, may, be, modified, into, the, noun, a, convert, through, stress, shift, and, into, the, adjective, convertible, through, affixation, inflection, adds, grammatical, information, to, a, word, such, as, indicating, case, tense, or, gender, 73, in, synthetic, languages, a, single, word, stem, for, example, love, may, inflect, to, have, a, number, of, different, forms, for, example, loves, loving, and, loved, however, for, some, purposes, these, are, not, usually, considered, to, be, different, words, but, rather, different, forms, of, the, same, word, in, these, languages, words, may, be, considered, to, be, constructed, from, a, number, of, morphemes, in, indo, european, languages, in, particular, the, morphemes, distinguished, are, thus, the, proto, indo, european, wr, dhom, would, be, analyzed, as, consisting, of, philosophers, have, found, words, to, be, objects, of, fascination, since, at, least, the, 5th, century, bc, with, the, foundation, of, the, philosophy, of, language, plato, analyzed, words, in, terms, of, their, origins, and, the, sounds, making, them, up, concluding, that, there, was, some, connection, between, sound, and, meaning, though, words, change, a, great, deal, over, time, john, locke, wrote, that, the, use, of, words, is, to, be, sensible, marks, of, ideas, though, they, are, chosen, not, by, any, natural, connexion, that, there, is, between, particular, articulate, sounds, and, certain, ideas, for, then, there, would, be, but, one, language, amongst, all, men, but, by, a, voluntary, imposition, whereby, such, a, word, is, made, arbitrarily, the, mark, of, such, an, idea, wittgenstein, s, thought, transitioned, from, a, word, as, representation, of, meaning, to, the, meaning, of, a, word, is, its, use, in, the, language, each, word, belongs, to, a, category, based, on, shared, grammatical, properties, typically, a, language, s, lexicon, may, be, classified, into, several, such, groups, of, words, the, total, number, of, categories, as, well, as, their, types, are, not, universal, and, vary, among, languages, for, example, english, has, a, group, of, words, called, articles, such, as, the, the, definite, article, or, a, the, indefinite, article, which, mark, definiteness, or, identifiability, this, class, is, not, present, in, japanese, which, depends, on, context, to, indicate, this, difference, on, the, other, hand, japanese, has, a, class, of, words, called, particles, which, are, used, to, mark, noun, phrases, according, to, their, grammatical, function, or, thematic, relation, which, english, marks, using, word, order, or, prosody, 21, 24, it, is, not, clear, if, any, categories, other, than, interjection, are, universal, parts, of, human, language, the, basic, bipartite, division, that, is, ubiquitous, in, natural, languages, is, that, of, nouns, vs, verbs, however, in, some, wakashan, and, salish, languages, all, content, words, may, be, understood, as, verbal, in, nature, in, lushootseed, a, salish, language, all, words, with, noun, like, meanings, can, be, used, predicatively, where, they, function, like, verb, for, example, the, word, sbiaw, can, be, understood, as, is, a, coyote, rather, than, simply, coyote, 13, 631, on, the, other, hand, in, eskimo, aleut, languages, all, content, words, can, be, analyzed, as, nominal, with, agentive, nouns, serving, the, role, closest, to, verbs, finally, in, some, austronesian, languages, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, distinction, is, applicable, and, all, words, can, be, best, described, as, interjections, which, can, perform, the, roles, of, other, categories, 13, 631, the, current, classification, of, words, into, classes, is, based, on, the, work, of, dionysius, thrax, who, in, the, 1st, century, bc, distinguished, eight, categories, of, ancient, greek, words, noun, verb, participle, article, pronoun, preposition, adverb, and, conjunction, later, latin, authors, apollonius, dyscolus, and, priscian, applied, his, framework, to, their, own, language, since, latin, has, no, articles, they, replaced, this, class, with, interjection, adjectives, happy, quantifiers, few, and, numerals, eleven, were, not, made, separate, in, those, classifications, due, to, their, morphological, similarity, to, nouns, in, latin, and, ancient, greek, they, were, recognized, as, distinct, categories, only, when, scholars, started, studying, later, european, languages, 13, 629, in, indian, grammatical, tradition, p, ini, introduced, a, similar, fundamental, classification, into, a, nominal, n, ma, sup, and, a, verbal, khy, ta, tin, class, based, on, the, set, of, suffixes, taken, by, the, word, some, words, can, be, controversial, such, as, slang, in, formal, contexts, misnomers, due, to, them, not, meaning, what, they, would, imply, or, polysemous, words, due, to, the, potential, confusion, between, their, various, senses, in, ancient, greek, and, roman, grammatical, tradition, the, word, was, the, basic, unit, of, analysis, different, grammatical, forms, of, a, given, lexeme, were, studied, however, there, was, no, attempt, to, decompose, them, into, morphemes, 70, this, may, have, been, the, result, of, the, synthetic, nature, of, these, languages, where, the, internal, structure, of, words, may, be, harder, to, decode, than, in, analytic, languages, there, was, also, no, concept, of, different, kinds, of, words, such, as, grammatical, or, phonological, the, word, was, considered, a, unitary, construct, 269, the, word, dicti, was, defined, as, the, minimal, unit, of, an, utterance, r, ti, the, expression, of, a, complete, thought, 70
