chinese, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, h, ny, lit, han, language, or, zh, ngw, n, chinese, writing, is, a, group, of, languages, spoken, natively, by, the, ethnic, han, chinese, majority, and, many, minority, ethnic, groups, in, china, approximately, 1, 35, billion, people, or, 17, of, the, global, population, speak, a, variety, of, chinese, as, their, first, language, chinese, languages, form, the, sinitic, branch, of, the, sino, tibetan, language, family, the, spoken, varieties, of, chinese, are, usually, considered, by, native, speakers, to, be, dialects, of, a, single, language, however, their, lack, of, mutual, intelligibility, means, they, are, sometimes, considered, to, be, separate, languages, in, a, family, investigation, of, the, historical, relationships, among, the, varieties, of, chinese, is, ongoing, currently, most, classifications, posit, 7, to, 13, main, regional, groups, based, on, phonetic, developments, from, middle, chinese, of, which, the, most, spoken, by, far, is, mandarin, with, 66, or, around, 800, million, speakers, followed, by, min, 75, million, e, g, southern, min, wu, 74, million, e, g, shanghainese, and, yue, 68, million, e, g, cantonese, these, branches, are, unintelligible, to, each, other, and, many, of, their, subgroups, are, unintelligible, with, the, other, varieties, within, the, same, branch, e, g, southern, min, there, are, however, transitional, areas, where, varieties, from, different, branches, share, enough, features, for, some, limited, intelligibility, including, new, xiang, with, southwestern, mandarin, xuanzhou, wu, chinese, with, lower, yangtze, mandarin, jin, with, central, plains, mandarin, and, certain, divergent, dialects, of, hakka, with, gan, all, varieties, of, chinese, are, tonal, at, least, to, some, degree, and, are, largely, analytic, the, earliest, attested, written, chinese, consists, of, the, oracle, bone, inscriptions, created, during, the, shang, dynasty, c, 1250, bce, the, phonetic, categories, of, old, chinese, can, be, reconstructed, from, the, rhymes, of, ancient, poetry, during, the, northern, and, southern, period, middle, chinese, went, through, several, sound, changes, and, split, into, several, varieties, following, prolonged, geographic, and, political, separation, the, qieyun, a, rime, dictionary, recorded, a, compromise, between, the, pronunciations, of, different, regions, the, royal, courts, of, the, ming, and, early, qing, dynasties, operated, using, a, koin, language, known, as, guanhua, based, on, the, nanjing, dialect, of, mandarin, standard, chinese, is, an, official, language, of, both, the, people, s, republic, of, china, and, the, republic, of, china, taiwan, one, of, the, four, official, languages, of, singapore, and, one, of, the, six, official, languages, of, the, united, nations, standard, chinese, is, based, on, the, beijing, dialect, of, mandarin, and, was, first, officially, adopted, in, the, 1930s, the, language, is, written, primarily, using, a, logography, of, chinese, characters, largely, shared, by, readers, who, may, otherwise, speak, mutually, unintelligible, varieties, since, the, 1950s, the, use, of, simplified, characters, has, been, promoted, by, the, government, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, with, singapore, officially, adopting, them, in, 1976, traditional, characters, are, used, in, taiwan, hong, kong, macau, and, among, chinese, speaking, communities, overseas, linguists, classify, all, varieties, of, chinese, as, part, of, the, sino, tibetan, language, family, together, with, burmese, tibetan, and, many, other, languages, spoken, in, the, himalayas, and, the, southeast, asian, massif, although, the, relationship, was, first, proposed, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, is, now, broadly, accepted, reconstruction, of, sino, tibetan, is, much, less, developed, than, that, of, families, such, as, indo, european, or, austroasiatic, difficulties, have, included, the, great, diversity, of, the, languages, the, lack, of, inflection, in, many, of, them, and, the, effects, of, language, contact, in, addition, many, of, the, smaller, languages, are, spoken, in, mountainous, areas, that, are, difficult, to, reach, and, are, often, also, sensitive, border, zones, without, a, secure, reconstruction, of, proto, sino, tibetan, the, higher, level, structure, of, the, family, remains, unclear, a, top, level, branching, into, chinese, and, tibeto, burman, languages, is, often, assumed, but, has, not, been, convincingly, demonstrated, the, first, written, records, appeared, over, 3, 000, years, ago, during, the, shang, dynasty, as, the, language, evolved, over, this, period, the, various, local, varieties, became, mutually, unintelligible, in, reaction, central, governments, have, repeatedly, sought, to, promulgate, a, unified, standard, the, earliest, examples, of, old, chinese, are, divinatory, inscriptions, on, oracle, bones, dated, to, c, 1250, bce, during, the, late, shang, the, next, attested, stage, came, from, inscriptions, on, bronze, artifacts, dating, to, the, western, zhou, period, 1046, 771, bce, the, classic, of, poetry, and, portions, of, the, book, of, documents, and, i, ching, scholars, have, attempted, to, reconstruct, the, phonology, of, old, chinese, by, comparing, later, varieties, of, chinese, with, the, rhyming, practice, of, the, classic, of, poetry, and, the, phonetic, elements, found, in, the, majority, of, chinese, characters, although, many, of, the, finer, details, remain, unclear, most, scholars, agree, that, old, chinese, differs, from, middle, chinese, in, lacking, retroflex, and, palatal, obstruents, but, having, initial, consonant, clusters, of, some, sort, and, in, having, voiceless, nasals, and, liquids, most, recent, reconstructions, also, describe, an, atonal, language, with, consonant, clusters, at, the, end, of, the, syllable, developing, into, tone, distinctions, in, middle, chinese, several, derivational, affixes, have, also, been, identified, but, the, language, lacks, inflection, and, indicated, grammatical, relationships, using, word, order, and, grammatical, particles, middle, chinese, was, the, language, used, during, northern, and, southern, dynasties, and, the, sui, tang, and, song, dynasties, 6th, 10th, centuries, ce, it, can, be, divided, into, an, early, period, reflected, by, the, qieyun, rime, dictionary, 601, ce, and, a, late, period, in, the, 10th, century, reflected, by, rhyme, tables, such, as, the, yunjing, constructed, by, ancient, chinese, philologists, as, a, guide, to, the, qieyun, system, these, works, define, phonological, categories, but, with, little, hint, of, what, sounds, they, represent, linguists, have, identified, these, sounds, by, comparing, the, categories, with, pronunciations, in, modern, varieties, of, chinese, borrowed, chinese, words, in, japanese, vietnamese, and, korean, and, transcription, evidence, the, resulting, system, is, very, complex, with, a, large, number, of, consonants, and, vowels, but, they, are, probably, not, all, distinguished, in, any, single, dialect, most, linguists, now, believe, it, represents, a, diasystem, encompassing, 6th, century, northern, and, southern, standards, for, reading, the, classics, the, complex, relationship, between, spoken, and, written, chinese, is, an, example, of, diglossia, as, spoken, chinese, varieties, have, evolved, at, different, rates, while, the, written, language, used, throughout, china, changed, comparatively, little, crystallizing, into, a, prestige, form, known, as, classical, or, literary, chinese, literature, written, distinctly, in, the, classical, form, began, to, emerge, during, the, spring, and, autumn, period, its, use, in, writing, remained, nearly, universal, until, the, late, 19th, century, culminating, with, the, widespread, adoption, of, written, vernacular, chinese, with, the, may, fourth, movement, beginning, in, 1919, after, the, fall, of, the, northern, song, dynasty, and, subsequent, reign, of, the, jurchen, jin, and, mongol, yuan, dynasties, in, northern, china, a, common, speech, now, called, old, mandarin, developed, based, on, the, dialects, of, the, north, china, plain, around, the, capital, the, 1324, zhongyuan, yinyun, was, a, dictionary, that, codified, the, rhyming, conventions, of, new, sanqu, verse, form, in, this, language, together, with, the, slightly, later, menggu, ziyun, this, dictionary, describes, a, language, with, many, of, the, features, characteristic, of, modern, mandarin, dialects, up, to, the, early, 20th, century, most, chinese, people, only, spoke, their, local, variety, thus, as, a, practical, measure, officials, of, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, carried, out, the, administration, of, the, empire, using, a, common, language, based, on, mandarin, varieties, known, as, gu, nhu, language, of, officials, for, most, of, this, period, this, language, was, a, koin, based, on, dialects, spoken, in, the, nanjing, area, though, not, identical, to, any, single, dialect, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, beijing, dialect, had, become, dominant, and, was, essential, for, any, business, with, the, imperial, court, in, the, 1930s, a, standard, national, language, gu, y, was, adopted, after, much, dispute, between, proponents, of, northern, and, southern, dialects, and, an, abortive, attempt, at, an, artificial, pronunciation, the, national, language, unification, commission, finally, settled, on, the, beijing, dialect, in, 1932, the, people, s, republic, founded, in, 1949, retained, this, standard, but, renamed, it, p, t, nghu, common, speech, the, national, language, is, now, used, in, education, the, media, and, formal, situations, in, both, mainland, china, and, taiwan, in, hong, kong, and, macau, cantonese, is, the, dominant, spoken, language, due, to, cultural, influence, from, guangdong, immigrants, and, colonial, era, policies, and, is, used, in, education, media, formal, speech, and, everyday, life, though, mandarin, is, increasingly, taught, in, schools, due, to, the, mainland, s, growing, influence, historically, the, chinese, language, has, spread, to, its, neighbors, through, a, variety, of, means, northern, vietnam, was, incorporated, into, the, han, dynasty, 202, bce, 220, ce, in, 111, bce, marking, the, beginning, of, a, period, of, chinese, control, that, ran, almost, continuously, for, a, millennium, the, four, commanderies, of, han, were, established, in, northern, korea, in, the, 1st, century, bce, but, disintegrated, in, the, following, centuries, chinese, buddhism, spread, over, east, asia, between, the, 2nd, and, 5th, centuries, ce, and, with, it, the, study, of, scriptures, and, literature, in, literary, chinese, later, strong, central, governments, modeled, on, chinese, institutions, were, established, in, korea, japan, and, vietnam, with, literary, chinese, serving, as, the, language, of, administration, and, scholarship, a, position, it, would, retain, until, the, late, 19th, century, in, korea, and, to, a, lesser, extent, japan, and, the, early, 20th, century, in, vietnam, scholars, from, different, lands, could, communicate, albeit, only, in, writing, using, literary, chinese, although, they, used, chinese, solely, for, written, communication, each, country, had, its, own, tradition, of, reading, texts, aloud, using, what, are, known, as, sino, xenic, pronunciations, chinese, words, with, these, pronunciations, were, also, extensively, imported, into, the, korean, japanese, and, vietnamese, languages, and, today, comprise, over, half, of, their, vocabularies, this, massive, influx, led, to, changes, in, the, phonological, structure, of, the, languages, contributing, to, the, development, of, moraic, structure, in, japanese, and, the, disruption, of, vowel, harmony, in, korean, borrowed, chinese, morphemes, have, been, used, extensively, in, all, these, languages, to, coin, compound, words, for, new, concepts, in, a, similar, way, to, the, use, of, latin, and, ancient, greek, roots, in, european, languages, many, new, compounds, or, new, meanings, for, old, phrases, were, created, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, to, name, western, concepts, and, artifacts, these, coinages, written, in, shared, chinese, characters, have, then, been, borrowed, freely, between, languages, they, have, even, been, accepted, into, chinese, a, language, usually, resistant, to, loanwords, because, their, foreign, origin, was, hidden, by, their, written, form, often, different, compounds, for, the, same, concept, were, in, circulation, for, some, time, before, a, winner, emerged, and, sometimes, the, final, choice, differed, between, countries, the, proportion, of, vocabulary, of, chinese, origin, thus, tends, to, be, greater, in, technical, abstract, or, formal, language, for, example, in, japan, sino, japanese, words, account, for, about, 35, of, the, words, in, entertainment, magazines, over, half, the, words, in, newspapers, and, 60, of, the, words, in, science, magazines, vietnam, korea, and, japan, each, developed, writing, systems, for, their, own, languages, initially, based, on, chinese, characters, but, later, replaced, with, the, hangul, alphabet, for, korean, and, supplemented, with, kana, syllabaries, for, japanese, while, vietnamese, continued, to, be, written, with, the, complex, ch, n, m, script, however, these, were, limited, to, popular, literature, until, the, late, 19th, century, today, japanese, is, written, with, a, composite, script, using, both, chinese, characters, called, kanji, and, kana, korean, is, written, exclusively, with, hangul, in, north, korea, although, knowledge, of, the, supplementary, chinese, characters, called, hanja, is, still, required, and, hanja, are, increasingly, rarely, used, in, south, korea, as, a, result, of, its, historical, colonization, by, france, vietnamese, now, uses, the, latin, based, vietnamese, alphabet, english, words, of, chinese, origin, include, tea, from, hokkien, t, dim, sum, from, cantonese, dim2, sam1, and, kumquat, from, cantonese, gam1, gwat1, the, sinologist, jerry, norman, has, estimated, that, there, are, hundreds, of, mutually, unintelligible, varieties, of, chinese, these, varieties, form, a, dialect, continuum, in, which, differences, in, speech, generally, become, more, pronounced, as, distances, increase, though, the, rate, of, change, varies, immensely, generally, mountainous, south, china, exhibits, more, linguistic, diversity, than, the, north, china, plain, until, the, late, 20th, century, chinese, emigrants, to, southeast, asia, and, north, america, came, from, southeast, coastal, areas, where, min, hakka, and, yue, dialects, were, spoken, specifically, most, chinese, immigrants, to, north, america, until, the, mid, 20th, century, spoke, taishanese, a, variety, of, yue, from, a, small, coastal, area, around, taishan, guangdong, in, parts, of, south, china, the, dialect, of, a, major, city, may, be, only, marginally, intelligible, to, its, neighbors, for, example, wuzhou, and, taishan, are, located, approximately, 260, km, 160, mi, and, 190, km, 120, mi, away, from, guangzhou, respectively, but, the, yue, variety, spoken, in, wuzhou, is, more, similar, to, the, guangzhou, dialect, than, is, taishanese, wuzhou, is, located, directly, upstream, from, guangzhou, on, the, pearl, river, whereas, taishan, is, to, guangzhou, s, southwest, with, the, two, cities, separated, by, several, river, valleys, in, parts, of, fujian, the, speech, of, some, neighbouring, counties, or, villages, is, mutually, unintelligible, local, varieties, of, chinese, are, conventionally, classified, into, seven, dialect, groups, largely, based, on, the, different, evolution, of, middle, chinese, voiced, initials, proportions, of, first, language, speakers, the, classification, of, li, rong, which, is, used, in, the, language, atlas, of, china, 1987, distinguishes, three, further, groups, some, varieties, remain, unclassified, including, the, danzhou, dialect, on, hainan, waxianghua, spoken, in, western, hunan, and, shaozhou, tuhua, spoken, in, northern, guangdong, standard, chinese, is, the, standard, language, of, china, where, it, is, called, p, t, nghu, and, taiwan, and, one, of, the, four, official, languages, of, singapore, where, it, is, called, either, hu, y, or, h, ny, standard, chinese, is, based, on, the, beijing, dialect, of, mandarin, the, governments, of, both, china, and, taiwan, intend, for, speakers, of, all, chinese, speech, varieties, to, use, it, as, a, common, language, of, communication, therefore, it, is, used, in, government, agencies, in, the, media, and, as, a, language, of, instruction, in, schools, diglossia, is, common, among, chinese, speakers, for, example, a, shanghai, resident, may, speak, both, standard, chinese, and, shanghainese, if, they, grew, up, elsewhere, they, are, also, likely, fluent, in, the, dialect, of, their, home, region, in, addition, to, standard, chinese, a, majority, of, taiwanese, people, also, speak, taiwanese, hokkien, also, called, taiwanese, hakka, or, an, austronesian, language, a, speaker, in, taiwan, may, mix, pronunciations, and, vocabulary, from, standard, chinese, and, other, languages, of, taiwan, in, everyday, speech, in, part, due, to, traditional, cultural, ties, with, guangdong, cantonese, is, used, as, an, everyday, language, in, hong, kong, and, macau, the, designation, of, various, chinese, branches, remains, controversial, some, linguists, and, most, ordinary, chinese, people, consider, all, the, spoken, varieties, as, one, single, language, as, speakers, share, a, common, national, identity, and, a, common, written, form, others, instead, argue, that, it, is, inappropriate, to, refer, to, major, branches, of, chinese, such, as, mandarin, wu, and, so, on, as, dialects, because, the, mutual, unintelligibility, between, them, is, too, great, however, calling, major, chinese, branches, languages, would, also, be, wrong, under, the, same, criterion, since, a, branch, such, as, wu, itself, contains, many, mutually, unintelligible, varieties, and, could, not, be, properly, called, a, single, language, there, are, also, viewpoints, pointing, out, that, linguists, often, ignore, mutual, intelligibility, when, varieties, share, intelligibility, with, a, central, variety, i, e, prestige, variety, such, as, standard, mandarin, as, the, issue, requires, some, careful, handling, when, mutual, intelligibility, is, inconsistent, with, language, identity, the, chinese, government, s, official, chinese, designation, for, the, major, branches, of, chinese, is, f, ngy, n, regional, speech, whereas, the, more, closely, related, varieties, within, these, are, called, d, di, n, f, ngy, n, local, speech, because, of, the, difficulties, involved, in, determining, the, difference, between, language, and, dialect, other, terms, have, been, proposed, these, include, topolect, lect, vernacular, regional, and, variety, syllables, in, the, chinese, languages, have, some, unique, characteristics, they, are, tightly, related, to, the, morphology, and, also, to, the, characters, of, the, writing, system, and, phonologically, they, are, structured, according, to, fixed, rules, the, structure, of, each, syllable, consists, of, a, nucleus, that, has, a, vowel, which, can, be, a, monophthong, diphthong, or, even, a, triphthong, in, certain, varieties, preceded, by, an, onset, a, single, consonant, or, consonant, glide, a, zero, onset, is, also, possible, and, followed, optionally, by, a, coda, consonant, a, syllable, also, carries, a, tone, there, are, some, instances, where, a, vowel, is, not, used, as, a, nucleus, an, example, of, this, is, in, cantonese, where, the, nasal, sonorant, consonants, m, and, can, stand, alone, as, their, own, syllable, in, mandarin, much, more, than, in, other, spoken, varieties, most, syllables, tend, to, be, open, syllables, meaning, they, have, no, coda, assuming, that, a, final, glide, is, not, analyzed, as, a, coda, but, syllables, that, do, have, codas, are, restricted, to, nasals, m, n, the, retroflex, approximant, and, voiceless, stops, p, t, k, or, some, varieties, allow, most, of, these, codas, whereas, others, such, as, standard, chinese, are, limited, to, only, n, and, the, number, of, sounds, in, the, different, spoken, dialects, varies, but, in, general, there, has, been, a, tendency, to, a, reduction, in, sounds, from, middle, chinese, the, mandarin, dialects, in, particular, have, experienced, a, dramatic, decrease, in, sounds, and, so, have, far, more, polysyllabic, words, than, most, other, spoken, varieties, the, total, number, of, syllables, in, some, varieties, is, therefore, only, about, a, thousand, including, tonal, variation, which, is, only, about, an, eighth, as, many, as, english, all, varieties, of, spoken, chinese, use, tones, to, distinguish, words, a, few, dialects, of, north, china, may, have, as, few, as, three, tones, while, some, dialects, in, south, china, have, up, to, 6, or, 12, tones, depending, on, how, one, counts, one, exception, from, this, is, shanghainese, which, has, reduced, the, set, of, tones, to, a, two, toned, pitch, accent, system, much, like, modern, japanese, a, very, common, example, used, to, illustrate, the, use, of, tones, in, chinese, is, the, application, of, the, four, tones, of, standard, chinese, along, with, the, neutral, tone, to, the, syllable, ma, the, tones, are, exemplified, by, the, following, five, chinese, words, in, contrast, standard, cantonese, has, six, tones, historically, finals, that, end, in, a, stop, consonant, were, considered, to, be, checked, tones, and, thus, counted, separately, for, a, total, of, nine, tones, however, they, are, considered, to, be, duplicates, in, modern, linguistics, and, are, no, longer, counted, as, such, chinese, is, often, described, as, a, monosyllabic, language, however, this, is, only, partially, correct, it, is, largely, accurate, when, describing, old, and, middle, chinese, in, classical, chinese, around, 90, of, words, consist, of, a, single, character, that, corresponds, one, to, one, with, a, morpheme, the, smallest, unit, of, meaning, in, a, language, in, modern, varieties, it, usually, remains, the, case, that, morphemes, are, monosyllabic, in, contrast, english, has, many, multi, syllable, morphemes, both, bound, and, free, such, as, seven, elephant, para, and, able, some, of, the, more, conservative, modern, varieties, usually, found, in, the, south, have, largely, monosyllabic, words, especially, with, basic, vocabulary, however, most, nouns, adjectives, and, verbs, in, modern, mandarin, are, disyllabic, a, significant, cause, of, this, is, phonetic, erosion, sound, changes, over, time, have, steadily, reduced, the, number, of, possible, syllables, in, the, language, s, inventory, in, modern, mandarin, there, are, only, around, 1, 200, possible, syllables, including, the, tonal, distinctions, compared, with, about, 5, 000, in, vietnamese, still, a, largely, monosyllabic, language, and, over, 8, 000, in, english, most, modern, varieties, tend, to, form, new, words, through, polysyllabic, compounds, in, some, cases, monosyllabic, words, have, become, disyllabic, formed, from, different, characters, without, the, use, of, compounding, as, in, k, long, from, k, ng, this, is, especially, common, in, jin, varieties, this, phonological, collapse, has, led, to, a, corresponding, increase, in, the, number, of, homophones, as, an, example, the, small, langenscheidt, pocket, chinese, dictionary, lists, six, words, that, are, commonly, pronounced, as, sh, in, standard, chinese, in, modern, spoken, mandarin, however, tremendous, ambiguity, would, result, if, all, of, these, words, could, be, used, as, is, the, 20th, century, yuen, ren, chao, poem, lion, eating, poet, in, the, stone, den, exploits, this, consisting, of, 92, characters, all, pronounced, shi, as, such, most, of, these, words, have, been, replaced, in, speech, if, not, in, writing, with, less, ambiguous, disyllabic, compounds, only, the, first, one, normally, appears, in, monosyllabic, form, in, spoken, mandarin, the, rest, are, normally, used, in, the, polysyllabic, forms, of, respectively, in, each, the, homophone, was, disambiguated, by, the, addition, of, another, morpheme, typically, either, a, near, synonym, or, some, sort, of, generic, word, e, g, head, thing, the, purpose, of, which, is, to, indicate, which, of, the, possible, meanings, of, the, other, homophonic, syllable, is, specifically, meant, however, when, one, of, the, above, words, forms, part, of, a, compound, the, disambiguating, syllable, is, generally, dropped, and, the, resulting, word, is, still, disyllabic, for, example, sh, alone, and, not, sh, tou, appears, in, compounds, as, meaning, stone, such, as, sh, g, o, plaster, sh, hu, lime, sh, k, grotto, quartz, and, sh, y, u, petroleum, although, many, single, syllable, morphemes, z, can, stand, alone, as, individual, words, they, more, often, than, not, form, multi, syllable, compounds, known, as, c, which, more, closely, resembles, the, traditional, western, notion, of, a, word, a, chinese, c, can, consist, of, more, than, one, character, morpheme, usually, two, but, there, can, be, three, or, more, examples, of, chinese, words, of, more, than, two, syllables, include, h, nb, ob, o, hamburger, sh, um, nyu, n, goalkeeper, and, di, nz, y, uji, n, e, mail, all, varieties, of, modern, chinese, are, analytic, languages, they, depend, on, syntax, word, order, and, sentence, structure, rather, than, inflectional, morphology, changes, in, the, form, of, a, word, to, indicate, a, word, s, function, within, a, sentence, in, other, words, chinese, has, very, few, grammatical, inflections, it, possesses, no, tenses, no, voices, no, grammatical, number, and, only, a, few, articles, they, make, heavy, use, of, grammatical, particles, to, indicate, aspect, and, mood, in, mandarin, this, involves, the, use, of, particles, such, as, le, pfv, h, i, still, and, y, j, ng, already, chinese, has, a, subject, verb, object, word, order, and, like, many, other, languages, of, east, asia, makes, frequent, use, of, the, topic, comment, construction, to, form, sentences, chinese, also, has, an, extensive, system, of, classifiers, and, measure, words, another, trait, shared, with, neighboring, languages, such, as, japanese, and, korean, other, notable, grammatical, features, common, to, all, the, spoken, varieties, of, chinese, include, the, use, of, serial, verb, construction, pronoun, dropping, and, the, related, subject, dropping, although, the, grammars, of, the, spoken, varieties, share, many, traits, they, do, possess, differences, the, entire, chinese, character, corpus, since, antiquity, comprises, well, over, 50, 000, characters, of, which, only, roughly, 10, 000, are, in, use, and, only, about, 3, 000, are, frequently, used, in, chinese, media, and, newspapers, however, chinese, characters, should, not, be, confused, with, chinese, words, because, most, chinese, words, are, made, up, of, two, or, more, characters, there, are, many, more, chinese, words, than, characters, a, more, accurate, equivalent, for, a, chinese, character, is, the, morpheme, as, characters, represent, the, smallest, grammatical, units, with, individual, meanings, in, the, chinese, language, estimates, of, the, total, number, of, chinese, words, and, lexicalized, phrases, vary, greatly, the, hanyu, da, zidian, a, compendium, of, chinese, characters, includes, 54, 678, head, entries, for, characters, including, oracle, bone, versions, the, zhonghua, zihai, 1994, contains, 85, 568, head, entries, for, character, definitions, and, is, the, largest,

standard, chinese, language, as, used, in, mainland, china, has, 13, 000, head, characters, and, defines, 70, 000, words, like, many, other, languages, chinese, has, absorbed, a, sizable, number, of, loanwords, from, other, cultures, most, chinese, words, are, formed, out, of, native, chinese, morphemes, including, words, describing, imported, objects, and, ideas, however, direct, phonetic, borrowing, of, foreign, words, has, gone, on, since, ancient, times, some, early, indo, european, loanwords, in, chinese, have, been, proposed, notably, honey, m, lion, sh, and, perhaps, horse, m, pig, zh, dog, qu, n, and, goose, ancient, words, borrowed, from, along, the, silk, road, during, the, old, chinese, period, include, grape, p, t, o, pomegranate, sh, li, and, lion, sh, zi, some, words, were, borrowed, from, buddhist, scriptures, including, buddha, f, and, bodhisattva, p, s, other, words, came, from, nomadic, peoples, to, the, north, such, as, hutong, words, borrowed, from, the, peoples, along, the, silk, road, such, as, grape, generally, have, persian, etymologies, buddhist, terminology, is, generally, derived, from, sanskrit, or, pali, the, liturgical, languages, of, northern, india, words, borrowed, from, the, nomadic, tribes, of, the, gobi, mongolian, or, northeast, regions, generally, have, altaic, etymologies, such, as, p, p, the, chinese, lute, or, cheese, or, yogurt, l, o, but, from, exactly, which, source, is, not, always, clear, modern, neologisms, are, primarily, translated, into, chinese, in, one, of, three, ways, free, translation, calques, phonetic, translation, by, sound, or, a, combination, of, the, two, today, it, is, much, more, common, to, use, existing, chinese, morphemes, to, coin, new, words, to, represent, imported, concepts, such, as, technical, expressions, and, international, scientific, vocabulary, wherein, the, latin, and, greek, components, are, usually, converted, one, for, one, into, the, corresponding, chinese, characters, the, word, telephone, was, initially, loaned, phonetically, as, d, l, f, ng, shanghainese, t, l, fon, this, word, was, widely, used, in, shanghai, during, the, 1920s, but, the, later, di, nhu, electric, speech, built, out, of, native, chinese, morphemes, became, prevalent, other, examples, include, occasionally, compromises, between, the, transliteration, and, translation, approaches, become, accepted, such, as, h, nb, ob, o, hamburger, from, hamburg, bun, sometimes, translations, are, designed, so, that, they, sound, like, the, original, while, incorporating, chinese, morphemes, phono, semantic, matching, such, as, m, l, o, for, the, video, game, character, mario, this, is, often, done, for, commercial, purposes, for, example, b, nt, ng, dashing, leaping, for, pentium, and, s, ib, iw, i, better, than, hundred, tastes, for, subway, foreign, words, mainly, proper, nouns, continue, to, enter, the, chinese, language, by, transcription, according, to, their, pronunciations, this, is, done, by, employing, chinese, characters, with, similar, pronunciations, for, example, israel, becomes, y, s, li, and, paris, becomes, b, l, a, rather, small, number, of, direct, transliterations, have, survived, as, common, words, including, sh, f, sofa, m, d, motor, y, um, humor, lu, ji, lu, j, logic, sh, m, o, smart, fashionable, and, xi, s, d, l, hysterics, the, bulk, of, these, words, were, originally, coined, in, shanghai, during, the, early, 20th, century, and, later, loaned, from, there, into, mandarin, hence, their, mandarin, pronunciations, occasionally, being, quite, divergent, from, the, english, for, example, in, shanghainese, sofa, and, motor, sound, more, like, their, english, counterparts, cantonese, differs, from, mandarin, with, some, transliterations, such, as, so1, faa3, 2, sofa, and, mo1, daa2, motor, western, foreign, words, representing, western, concepts, have, influenced, chinese, since, the, 20th, century, through, transcription, from, french, b, l, i, and, xi, ngb, n, were, borrowed, for, ballet, and, champagne, respectively, k, f, i, was, borrowed, from, italian, caff, coffee, the, influence, of, english, is, particularly, pronounced, from, the, early, 20th, century, many, english, words, were, borrowed, into, shanghainese, such, as, g, o, rf, golf, and, the, aforementioned, sh, f, sofa, later, american, soft, power, gave, rise, to, d, s, k, disco, k, l, cola, and, m, n, miniskirt, contemporary, colloquial, cantonese, has, distinct, loanwords, from, english, such, as, kaa1, tung1, cartoon, gei1, lou2, gay, people, dik1, si6, 2, taxi, and, baa1, si6, 2, bus, with, the, rising, popularity, of, the, internet, there, is, a, current, vogue, in, china, for, coining, english, transliterations, for, example, f, ns, fans, h, ik, hacker, and, b, k, blog, in, taiwan, some, of, these, transliterations, are, different, such, as, h, ik, hacker, and, b, lu, g, interconnected, tribes, for, blog, another, result, of, english, influence, on, chinese, is, the, appearance, of, so, called, z, m, c, lettered, words, spelled, with, letters, from, the, english, alphabet, these, have, appeared, in, colloquial, usage, as, well, as, in, magazines, and, newspapers, and, on, websites, and, television, since, the, 20th, century, another, source, of, words, has, been, kanji, japan, re, molded, european, concepts, and, inventions, into, wasei, kango, japanese, made, chinese, and, many, of, these, words, have, been, re, loaned, into, modern, chinese, other, terms, were, coined, by, the, japanese, by, giving, new, senses, to, existing, chinese, terms, or, by, referring, to, expressions, used, in, classical, chinese, literature, for, example, j, ngj, keizai, in, japanese, which, in, the, original, chinese, meant, the, workings, of, the, state, narrowed, to, economy, in, japanese, this, narrowed, definition, was, then, re, imported, into, chinese, as, a, result, these, terms, are, virtually, indistinguishable, from, native, chinese, words, indeed, there, is, some, dispute, over, some, of, these, terms, as, to, whether, the, japanese, or, chinese, coined, them, first, as, a, result, of, this, loaning, chinese, korean, japanese, and, vietnamese, share, a, corpus, of, linguistic, terms, describing, modern, terminology, paralleling, the, similar, corpus, of, terms, built, from, greco, latin, and, shared, among, european, languages, the, chinese, orthography, centers, on, chinese, characters, which, are, written, within, imaginary, square, blocks, traditionally, arranged, in, vertical, columns, read, from, top, to, bottom, down, a, column, and, right, to, left, across, columns, despite, alternative, arrangement, with, rows, of, characters, from, left, to, right, within, a, row, and, from, top, to, bottom, across, rows, like, english, and, other, western, writing, systems, having, become, more, popular, since, the, 20th, century, chinese, characters, denote, morphemes, independent, of, phonetic, variation, in, different, languages, thus, the, character, one, is, pronounced, as, y, in, standard, chinese, yat1, in, cantonese, and, it, in, hokkien, a, form, of, min, most, modern, written, chinese, is, in, the, form, of, written, vernacular, chinese, based, on, spoken, standard, chinese, regardless, of, dialectical, background, written, vernacular, chinese, largely, replaced, literary, chinese, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, the, country, s, standard, written, language, however, vocabularies, from, different, chinese, speaking, areas, have, diverged, and, the, divergence, can, be, observed, in, written, chinese, due, to, the, divergence, of, variants, some, unique, morphemes, are, not, found, in, standard, chinese, characters, rarely, used, in, standard, chinese, have, also, been, created, or, inherited, from, archaic, literary, standards, to, represent, these, unique, morphemes, for, example, characters, like, and, are, actively, used, in, cantonese, and, hakka, while, being, archaic, or, unused, in, standard, written, chinese, the, most, prominent, example, of, a, non, standard, chinese, orthography, is, written, cantonese, which, is, used, in, tabloids, and, on, the, internet, among, cantonese, speakers, in, hong, kong, and, elsewhere, chinese, had, no, uniform, system, of, phonetic, transcription, until, the, mid, 20th, century, although, enunciation, patterns, were, recorded, in, early, rime, books, and, dictionaries, early, indian, translators, working, in, sanskrit, and, pali, were, the, first, to, attempt, to, describe, the, sounds, and, enunciation, patterns, of, chinese, in, a, foreign, language, after, the, 15th, century, the, efforts, of, jesuits, and, western, court, missionaries, resulted, in, some, latin, character, transcription, writing, systems, based, on, various, variants, of, chinese, languages, some, of, these, latin, character, based, systems, are, still, being, used, to, write, various, chinese, variants, in, the, modern, era, in, hunan, women, in, certain, areas, write, their, local, chinese, language, variant, in, n, shu, a, syllabary, derived, from, chinese, characters, the, dungan, language, considered, by, many, a, dialect, of, mandarin, is, nowadays, written, in, cyrillic, and, was, previously, written, in, the, arabic, script, the, dungan, people, are, primarily, muslim, and, live, mainly, in, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, and, russia, many, hui, people, living, mainly, in, china, also, speak, the, language, each, chinese, character, represents, a, monosyllabic, chinese, word, or, morpheme, in, 100, ce, the, famed, han, dynasty, scholar, xu, shen, classified, characters, into, six, categories, pictographs, simple, ideographs, compound, ideographs, phonetic, loans, phonetic, compounds, and, derivative, characters, only, 4, were, categorized, as, pictographs, including, many, of, the, simplest, characters, such, as, r, n, human, r, sun, sh, n, mountain, and, shu, water, between, 80, and, 90, were, classified, as, phonetic, compounds, such, as, ch, ng, pour, combining, a, phonetic, component, zh, ng, with, a, semantic, component, of, the, radical, a, reduced, form, of, water, almost, all, characters, created, since, have, been, made, using, this, format, the, 18th, century, kangxi, dictionary, classified, characters, under, a, now, common, set, of, 214, radicals, modern, characters, are, styled, after, the, regular, script, various, other, written, styles, are, also, used, in, chinese, calligraphy, including, seal, script, cursive, script, and, clerical, script, calligraphy, artists, can, write, in, traditional, and, simplified, characters, but, they, tend, to, use, traditional, characters, for, traditional, art, there, are, currently, two, systems, for, chinese, characters, traditional, characters, used, in, hong, kong, taiwan, macau, and, many, overseas, chinese, speaking, communities, largely, take, their, form, from, received, character, forms, dating, back, to, the, late, han, dynasty, and, standardized, during, the, ming, simplified, characters, introduced, by, the, people, s, republic, of, china, prc, in, 1954, to, promote, mass, literacy, simplifies, most, complex, traditional, glyphs, to, fewer, strokes, especially, by, adopting, common, cursive, shorthand, variants, and, merging, characters, with, similar, pronunciations, to, the, one, with, the, least, strokes, among, other, methods, singapore, which, has, a, large, chinese, community, was, the, second, nation, to, officially, adopt, simplified, characters, first, by, creating, its, own, simplified, characters, then, by, adopting, entirely, the, prc, simplified, characters, it, has, also, become, the, de, facto, standard, for, younger, ethnic, chinese, in, malaysia, the, internet, provides, practice, reading, each, of, these, systems, and, most, chinese, readers, are, capable, of, if, not, necessarily, comfortable, with, reading, the, alternative, system, through, experience, and, guesswork, a, well, educated, chinese, reader, today, recognizes, approximately, 4, 000, to, 6, 000, characters, approximately, 3, 000, characters, are, required, to, read, a, mainland, newspaper, the, prc, defines, literacy, amongst, workers, as, a, knowledge, of, 2, 000, characters, though, this, would, be, only, functional, literacy, school, children, typically, learn, around, 2, 000, characters, whereas, scholars, may, memorize, up, to, 10, 000, a, large, unabridged, dictionary, like, the, kangxi, dictionary, contains, over, 40, 000, characters, including, obscure, variant, rare, and, archaic, characters, fewer, than, a, quarter, of, these, characters, are, now, commonly, used, romanization, is, the, process, of, transcribing, a, language, into, the, latin, script, there, are, many, systems, of, romanization, for, the, chinese, varieties, due, to, the, lack, of, a, native, phonetic, transcription, until, modern, times, chinese, is, first, known, to, have, been, written, in, latin, characters, by, western, christian, missionaries, in, the, 16th, century, today, the, most, common, romanization, for, standard, chinese, is, hanyu, pinyin, introduced, in, 1956, by, the, prc, and, later, adopted, by, singapore, and, taiwan, pinyin, is, almost, universally, employed, now, for, teaching, standard, spoken, chinese, in, schools, and, universities, across, the, americas, australia, and, europe, chinese, parents, also, use, pinyin, to, teach, their, children, the, sounds, and, tones, of, new, words, in, school, books, that, teach, chinese, the, pinyin, romanization, is, often, shown, below, a, picture, of, the, thing, the, word, represents, with, the, chinese, character, alongside, the, second, most, common, romanization, system, the, wade, giles, was, invented, by, thomas, wade, in, 1859, and, modified, by, herbert, giles, in, 1892, as, this, system, approximates, the, phonology, of, mandarin, chinese, into, english, consonants, and, vowels, it, is, largely, an, anglicization, it, may, be, particularly, helpful, for, beginner, chinese, speakers, of, an, english, speaking, background, wade, giles, was, found, in, academic, use, in, the, united, states, particularly, before, the, 1980s, and, was, widely, used, in, taiwan, until, 2009, when, used, within, european, texts, the, tone, transcriptions, in, both, pinyin, and, wade, giles, are, often, left, out, for, simplicity, wade, giles, s, extensive, use, of, apostrophes, is, also, usually, omitted, thus, most, western, readers, will, be, much, more, familiar, with, beijing, than, they, will, be, with, b, ij, ng, pinyin, and, with, taipei, than, t, ai, 2, pei, 3, wade, giles, this, simplification, presents, syllables, as, homophones, which, are, not, and, therefore, exaggerates, the, number, of, homophones, almost, by, a, factor, of, four, for, comparison, other, systems, include, gwoyeu, romatzyh, the, french, efeo, the, yale, system, invented, for, use, by, us, troops, during, world, war, ii, as, well, as, distinct, systems, for, the, phonetic, requirements, of, cantonese, min, nan, hakka, and, other, varieties, chinese, varieties, have, been, phonetically, transcribed, into, many, other, writing, systems, over, the, centuries, the, phags, pa, script, for, example, has, been, very, helpful, in, reconstructing, the, pronunciations, of, premodern, forms, of, chinese, bopomofo, or, zhuyin, is, a, semi, syllabary, that, is, still, widely, used, in, taiwan, to, aid, standard, pronunciation, there, are, also, at, least, two, systems, of, cyrillization, for, chinese, the, most, widespread, is, the, palladius, system, with, the, growing, importance, and, influence, of, china, s, economy, globally, standard, chinese, instruction, has, been, gaining, popularity, in, schools, throughout, east, asia, southeast, asia, and, the, western, world, besides, mandarin, cantonese, is, the, only, other, chinese, language, that, is, widely, taught, as, a, foreign, language, largely, due, to, the, economic, and, cultural, influence, of, hong, kong, and, its, widespread, usage, among, significant, overseas, chinese, communities, in, 1991, there, were, 2, 000, foreign, learners, taking, china, s, official, chinese, proficiency, test, called, hanyu, shuiping, kaoshi, hsk, comparable, to, the, english, cambridge, certificate, but, by, 2005, the, number, of, candidates, had, risen, sharply, to, 117, 660, and, in, 2010, to, 750, 000, linguists, in, china, often, use, a, formulation,
